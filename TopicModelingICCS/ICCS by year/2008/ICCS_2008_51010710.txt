Abstract. Structural pounding during earthquakes is a complex phenomenon
involving plastic deformations, local cracking, etc. The aim of the present paper
is to check the accuracy of three pounding force numerical models, such as: the
linear viscoelastic model, the non-linear elastic model following the Hertz law
of contact and the non-linear viscoelastic model. In the analysis, the results of
numerical simulations have been compared with the results of an impact
experiment conducted by dropping balls of different building materials. The
results of the study indicate that the non-linear viscoelastic model is the most
precise one in simulating the pounding force time history during impact.
Keywords: pounding, earthquakes, impact force, numerical simulation.

1 Introduction
Earthquake-induced pounding between neighbouring, inadequately separated
buildings or bridge segments can lead to considerable damage or even collapse of
colliding structures (see, for example, [1,2]). Impact itself is a highly complex
phenomenon involving plastic deformations at contact points, local cracking or
crushing, friction, etc. what results in difficulty in its modelling. Structural pounding
has been recently intensively studied applying different numerical models of impact
force. The fundamental study on pounding between buildings in series using a linear
viscoelastic model has been conducted by Anagnostopoulos [3]. Jankowski et al. [4]
used the same model to study pounding of superstructure segments in bridges. In
order to simulate the force-deformation relation more realistically, a non-linear elastic
model following the Hertz law of contact has been adopted by a number of
researchers (see, for example, [5,6]). For the purposes of a more precise simulation of
a physical phenomenon, a non-linear viscoelastic model has also been considered [79]. In this model, a non-linear spring following the Hertz law of contact is applied
together with an additional non-linear damper, which is activated during the approach
period of collision in order to simulate the process of energy loss taking place mainly
during that period.
The aim of the present paper is to check the accuracy of these pounding force
models for the purposes of simulation of different building materials impacts. In the

analysis, the results of numerical simulations have been compared with the results of
an impact experiment conducted by dropping balls of different mass.

2 Pounding Force Numerical Models
2.1 Linear Viscoelastic Model
The linear viscoelastic model is the most frequently used one for simulation of
structural pounding under earthquake excitation (see, for example, [3,4]). The
pounding force during impact, F (t ) , for this model is expressed as:

F (t ) = kδ (t ) + cδ& (t ) ,

(1)

where δ (t ) describes the deformation of colliding structural members, δ& (t ) denotes
the relative velocity between them, k is the impact element’s stiffness simulating the
local stiffness at the contact point and c is the impact element’s damping, which can
be obtained from the formula [3]:
c = 2ξ k

m1m2
,
m1 + m2

(2)

where m1 , m2 are masses of structural members and ξ is the damping ratio related to
a coefficient of restitution, e, which accounts for the energy dissipation during impact
[10]. Value of e = 1 deals with the case of a fully elastic collision, value of e = 0
with a fully plastic one. The relation between ξ and e in the linear viscoelastic model
is given by the formula [3]:

ξ=

− ln e

π + (ln e) 2

.

2.2 Non-linear Elastic Model

In order to model the pounding force-deformation relation more realistically, a nonlinear elastic model following the Hertz law of contact has been adopted by a number
of researchers [5,6]. The pounding force, F (t ) , for this model is expressed by the
formula:
3

F (t ) = βδ 2 (t ) ,

(4)

where β is the impact stiffness parameter, which depends on material properties and
geometry of colliding bodies. The disadvantage of the Hertz contact law model is that
it is fully elastic and does not account for the energy dissipation during contact due to
plastic deformations, local crushing, etc.

2.3 Non-linear Viscoelastic Model

For the purposes of a more precise simulation of an impact phenomenon, a non-linear
viscoelastic model has been proposed [7]. The pounding force, F (t ) , for this model is
expressed by the formula:
3

for δ&(t ) > 0 (approach period),

3

for δ&( t ) ≤ 0 (restitution period),

F (t ) = βδ 2 (t ) + c (t )δ&(t )
F (t ) = βδ 2 (t )

(5)

where β is the impact stiffness parameter and c (t ) is the impact element’s damping,
which at any instant of time can be obtained from the formula [7]:
c (t ) = 2ξ β δ (t )

m1m2
,
m1 + m2

(6)

where ξ denotes the damping ratio related to a coefficient of restitution, e. The
approximate relation between ξ
expressed by the formula [11]:

3 Comparison of Pounding Force Numerical Models
In order to verify the accuracy of pounding force models for the use of different
building materials, the results of the numerical simulations have been compared with
the results of an impact experiment conducted by dropping steel, concrete and timber
balls of different mass on rigid surface. Balls have been dropped from various height
levels in order to obtain different impact velocities. The properties of balls used in the
experiment are specified in Table 1. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Setup of the experiment

The numerical analysis has been conducted using the following equation of motion:
my&&(t ) + F (t ) = mg ,

(8)

where m is mass of a ball, &&
y (t ) its vertical acceleration and g stands for the
acceleration of gravity. The pounding force, F (t ) , has been set to zero when y (t ) ≤ h
(h is a drop height) and has been calculated according to Equation (1), (4) or (5) when
y (t ) > h , whereas the deformation, δ (t ) , has been calculated as:

δ (t ) = y (t ) − h .

(9)

A time-stepping integration procedure with constant time step Δt = 1×10−6 s has
been applied to solve the Equation (8) numerically. The values of the impact stiffness
parameters: k , β and β , defining the models used in the numerical analysis, have
been determined using the method of the least squares. The difference between the
results of the experiment and the results of the numerical analysis has been assessed
by calculating the normalised error:
E=

F−F
F

⋅100% .

(10)

where F is an impact time history vector obtained from the experiment, F is an
impact time history vector obtained from the numerical analysis and F − F is an
Euclidean norm of F − F .

The experimental study and the numerical analysis have been conducted for a large
number of impact cases. In the following sections of this paper, the examples of the
results are presented.
3.1 Steel-to-Steel Impact

In the first example, the results of the numerical analysis are compared with the
results of the experiment conducted for a steel ball of mass 2.013 kg impacting the
steel surface with the velocity of 0.92 m/s. In the numerical analysis, the following
values of parameters defining the different pounding force models have been
used: k = 4.82 × 108 N/m , ξ = 0.17 (e = 0.58) for the linear viscoelastic model,

β = 7.55 × 1010 N/m 3/2 for the non-linear elastic model and β = 6.60 × 1010 N/m 3/2 ,
ξ = 0.49 (e = 0.58) for the non-linear viscoelastic model. The pounding force time
history measured during the experiment and the histories received from the numerical
analysis for the considered example of steel-to-steel impact are presented in Fig. 2.
Using Equation (10), the simulation errors for pounding force histories have been
calculated as equal to: 15.9% for the linear viscoelastic model, 64.1% for the nonlinear elastic model and 15.3% for the non-linear viscoelastic model.

analysis, the following values of parameters defining the different pounding force
models have been used: k = 4.91 × 107 N/m , ξ = 0.09 (e = 0.76) for the linear
viscoelastic model, β = 1.04 × 1010 N/m3/2 for the non-linear elastic model and

The pounding force time history measured during the experiment and the histories
received from the numerical analysis for the considered example of concrete-toconcrete impact are presented in Fig. 3. The simulation errors for pounding force
histories from Fig. 3 have been calculated as equal to: 12.7% for the linear
viscoelastic model, 33.5% for the non-linear elastic model and 11.6% for the nonlinear viscoelastic model.

4 Conclusions
The results of the study indicate that the non-linear viscoelastic model is the most
precise one in simulating the pounding force time histories during impact for three
different building materials. The model allows us to simulate the relatively rapid
increase in the pounding force during the approach period of collision and the
decrease in the force with lower unloading rate during the restitution period. Because
of the above the model can be successfully used for the numerical simulations of
pounding-involved response of structures under earthquake excitation in order to

enhance the accuracy of the analysis. On the other hand, Figs. 2-4 show the
drawbacks of the two other models considered. In the case of the linear viscoelastic
model, the negative force can be observed just before separation, which does not have
any physical explanation. In the case of the non-linear elastic model following the
Hertz contact law, the pounding force history at approach and restitution periods is
symmetric, due to elastic behaviour, and a maximum pounding force attains a higher
value in comparison with the experimental results.
