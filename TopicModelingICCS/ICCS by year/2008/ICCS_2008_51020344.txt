Abstract. The trans and gauche rotamers of 1,2-diisocyanoethane, 1,2diisocyanodisilane and isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane have been studied in the
gas phase. A transition state has also been obtained for the interconversion of
these rotamers. The methods used are MP2 and DFT/B3LYP and the basis sets
used for all atoms are 6-311++G(d,p). The optimised geometries, dipole moments,
moment of inertia, energies, energy differences and rotational barriers are reported. Vibrational frequencies of the rotamers are presented with appropriate assignments. The results indicate that the trans rotamer is more stable and the
G2MP2 rotational energy differences are 2.97 kJ/mol (1,2-diisocyanoethane),
3.02 kJ/mol (isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane) and 2.12 kJ/mol (1,2-diisocyanodisilane).
The rotational barrier for 1,2-diisocyanoethane is larger than its energy difference but the
barrier becomes comparable to the energy difference for isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane.
Keywords: 1, 2-diisocyanoethane, 1, 2-diisocyanodisilane and isocyano (isocyanomethyl)silane, MP2, DFT/B3LYP, energy difference, rotational barrier.

1 Introduction
1,2-Diisocyanoethane is a symmetrical 1,2-disubstituted ethane and therefore exists as
two rotamers namely the trans and gauche rotamers which are in equilibrium [1-5].
1,2-Dicyanoethane has been the subject of experimental [6] and theoretical conformational studies [7-11]. However 1,2-diisocyanoethane has not been comparably studied
although the isocyano group is one of the most polar neutral substituents.
Schrumpf and Martin [12] reported the conformation and vibrational spectra of
1,2-diisocyanoethane by measuring its infrared spectra in the vapour, liquid crystalline solid and several solvents. They also carried out semiempirical computations at
the INDO level and concluded that the two forms are of about equal stabilities with
the gauche form being slightly favoured. However they pointed about the shortcomings of semi empirical computation, which can be remedied by more refined ab initio
level. Schrumpf et al. [13] reported the molecular structure of 1,2-diisocyanoethane
obtained using the gas electron-diffraction method. They identified two distinct rotamers namely the trans and gauche forms. They concluded that the trans form is

more stable with a percentage of 56.9 in the equilibrium mixture. In a previous communication [11], a theoretical gas phase study of trans and gauche rotamers of 1,2dicyanoethane and structurally analogous compounds, 1,2-dicyanodisilane and
cyano(cyanomethyl)silane, was reported in terms of molecular structures, energies
and infrared frequencies. The results indicate that in general, the energy difference
between the trans and gauche rotamers is in the order: 1,2-dicyanoethane >
cyano(cyanomethyl)silane > 1,2-dicyanodisilane.
Thus although 1,2-diisocyanoethane has received attention, to the best of our knowledge there have not been studies involving 1,2-diisocyanodisilane and isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane although they are structurally related to 1,2diisocyanoethane. Some of the motivations of this work are derived from the limited
literature of 1,2-diisocyanodisilane and isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane and more importantly, isocyano compounds are widely used as ligands [14] and occur naturally in marine
organisms [15].
In this paper, the molecular structures, energy difference (∆E) between the gauche
and trans rotamers, rotational barrier, rotational thermodynamics, and vibrational
spectra of the trans and gauche rotamers have been obtained for the title compounds
using MP2 and DFT/B3LYP methods. Some of the results obtained are compared
with the reported parameters of their isomeric dicyano compounds [11]. The findings
of this work are hereby reported.

2 Methods
MP2 and DFT/B3LYP computations have been carried out for molecular geometry
optimisation of the trans and gauche rotamers of the title compounds. The trans rotamers of 1,2-diisocyanoethane and 1,2-diisocyanodisilane have been studied in C2h
symmetry but the trans rotamer of isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane has been considered in Cs symmetry. The gauche rotamers of 1,2-diisocyanoethane and 1,2diisocyanodisilane have been studied in C2 symmetry but the gauche rotamer of isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane has been considered in C1 symmetry. A transition state
has also been obtained for the interconversion of these rotamers. The basis sets used
for all atoms are 6-311++G(d,p). G2/MP2 computations have also been carried out.
Frequency computations have been carried out using the optimised structures. All
computations have been done using Gaussian 03W [16] program suite and Gauss
View [17] has been used for visualising the rotamers.

3 Results and Discussion
The relevant structural optimised structures of the trans and gauche rotamers of the
title compounds are reported in Table 1. Several conclusions can be drawn from
Table 1. Firstly, there is little difference between the values of the different parameters obtained using the two methods of theory. Secondly, there is a good comparison

between some of the calculated parameters and available literature data 1,2diisocyanoethane. To be more precise, the reported bond lengths (Å) of C-H, N≡C, CC and C-N are 1.123. 1.172, 1.529 and 1.424 respectively [13]. Further the torsional
angle N-C-C-N for the gauche conformer is reported to be 56.9º [13]. Thirdly, the
torsional angles calculated for the gauche rotamers are generally greater from DFT
than MP2 computations. Lastly, the moment of inertias calculated for the rotamers
follow the order IA >> IB ≈ IC. Apart from these, the effect of substituting the cyano
group by the isocyano group can be found by comparing the results obtained with
those reported [11]. It is found that substitution affects mainly the bond length between carbon and nitrogen with the bond being shorter in case of the dicyano compounds. The transition state modeled corresponds to the isocyano group eclipsing

hydrogen atom. Further, the bond lengths of the transition state structures are comparable to those of the trans and gauche rotamers.
Table 2 summarises the energies of the trans and gauche rotamers, ∆E and related
thermodynamical parameters. Some conclusions can be drawn from Table 2. Firstly,
for all the three molecules, the trans rotamer has lower energy than the gauche form.
Secondly, ∆E is generally larger from DFT than MP2 computations when the same
basis set is used. Lastly, the percentage of the trans rotamer can be calculated using
the free energy difference (∆G) between the trans and gauche rotamers and the fact
that there are two equivalent gauche forms. It is found that at 298.15 K, in general, the
equilibrium mixture is more populated with the trans conformer and this is in agreement with literature for 1,2-diisocyanoethane [13]. The rotational barriers, the energy
difference between the gauche rotamer and transition state, for 1,2-diisocyanoethane,
1,2-diisocyanodisilane and isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane are 16.32, 6.59 and 2.32
kJ/mol (MP2) and 11.35, 4.46 and 1.77 kJ/mol (DFT) respectively. It can be found
that the rotational barrier decreases and it becomes comparable to the energy difference for isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane. Apart from these, for a given method, the
relative energy indicates that a dicyano compound has lower energy than its isomeric
diisocyano compound [11].

1,2-diisocyanodisilane and Γv = 13A + 11B of the C2 point group of the gauche rotamer
of 1,2-diisocyanoethane and 1,2-diisocyanodisilane. Further, the 24 modes of vibrations

′
account for the irreducible representations Γv = 9A + 15A of the Cs point group of the
trans rotamer of isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane and Γv = 24A of the C1 point group of
the gauche rotamer of isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane. These infrared vibrational frequencies are dominated by the high intensity of the N≡C stretching frequency. It is
interesting to note the close agreement of the calculated infrared raw vibrational frequencies (gas phase) and experimental literature data (liquid phase) [12] for 1,2diisocyanoethane. Apart from these, it can be found that substitution of the cyano
groups by the isocyano groups affects mainly the vibrational frequencies where the
cyano groups are attached [11].

4 Conclusion
This paper reports the gas phase theoretical study of the trans and gauche rotamers of
1,2-diisocyanoethane, novel 1,2-diisocyanodisilane and isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane in terms of optimised molecular structures and infrared raw vibrational frequencies. The rotational barrier and related thermodynamic parameters are also given.
The trans rotamer is more stable than gauche rotamer. An interesting outcome of this
work is that some of the calculated parameters for 1,2-diisocyanoethane compare
satisfactorily with experimental literature data. More interestingly, although the
changes in structure and energy are relatively small when carbon is substituted by
silicon, data for the trans and gauche rotamers for the novel 1,2-diisocyanodisilane
and isocyano(isocyanomethyl)silane could serve as a reliable set of reference as their
literature is limited.
