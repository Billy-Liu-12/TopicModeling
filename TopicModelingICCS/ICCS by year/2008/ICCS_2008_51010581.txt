Abstract. Constantly released Helium on board of the Herschel spacecraft is used to cool three scientiﬁc instruments down to 0.3 K. The
Helium is released by small nozzles creating a counter-torque. This compensates the torque caused by the solar pressure acting on the spacecraft
surfaces. An optimization of the nozzle shape did not allow avoiding severe plume impingement on the spacecraft surfaces and consequently the
application of baﬄes has been considered to reduce plume impingement
eﬀects. Two baﬄe shapes, cylindrical and conical, with diﬀerent radii
and lengths have been analyzed numerically. The analysis has been performed with a kinetic approach, namely, the direct simulation Monte
Carlo (DSMC) method to cope with changing ﬂow regime from continuum in a subsonic part of the nozzle through transitional to freemolecular ﬂow inside the baﬄe. A direct application of DSMC-based
software would require large computer resources to model the nozzle
and plume ﬂows simultaneously. Therefore, the computation was split
in two successive computations for the nozzle and nozzle/plume ﬂow.
Computations of plume ﬂow with and without baﬄes were performed to
study eﬀects of baﬄe size and shape on the plume divergence, and plume
impingement on the Herschel spacecraft. It has been shown that small
baﬄes even widen the plume. An increase of radius/length of the baﬄe
decreases the plume divergence, however even the largest baﬄe could not
meet the requirements.

Introduction

The ’Herschel Space Observatory’ is part of the fourth cornerstone mission in
the ’Horizons 2000’ program of the European Space Agency (ESA), with the objectives to study the formation of galaxies in the early universe and the creation
of stars. In a dual launch together with Planck, Herschel will be placed in an operational Lissajous orbit around the Earth-Sun L2 point by an Ariane 5 in 2008
to perform photometer and spectrometer measurements, covering the full far
infrared to sub-millimetre wavelength range from 60 to 670 micrometers during
its operational lifetime of 3.5 years. The prime contractor for Herschel/Planck
is ThalesAlenia Space in Cannes, France, while the Herschel Payload Module is
developed, built and tested under responsibility of EADS Astrium Spacecrafts
in Friedrichshafen, Germany.

The released Helium creates at the nozzles a counter-torque, which is used
to compensate the torque caused by the solar pressure acting on the spacecraft.
This counter-torque is partly neutralized by the Helium plume impingement on
the spacecraft surfaces. To reduce the eﬀect of the plume impingement, 95% of
the total thrust has to be within a half-cone of 30 deg in a distance of 0.5 m from
the nozzle. To achieve the goal the following investigations have been performed:
– Optimization of the nozzle geometry to decrease a plume divergence,
– Application of a baﬄe for further decrease of the divergence (the baﬄe shall
be small and have a simple shape),
– Deﬁnition of proper cant angle and nozzle locations if the design goal could
not be achieved by the above activities.
Plume exhausted from a nozzle in a hard vacuum is characterized by the
presence of all ﬂow regimes, from continuum in the nozzle and even in the plume
near ﬁeld through transitional to free-molecular ﬂow at a large distance from
the nozzle. Modelling of such ﬂows requires a special approach, for example,
a successive application of continuum and kinetic methods (see [1] and refs.
herein). The given problem is complicated by the facts that 1) a transitional
ﬂow regime occurs inside the nozzle due to a small mass ﬂow rate and 2) a
baﬄe can aﬀect the ﬂow at the nozzle exit plane and, probably, even inside the
supersonic part of the nozzle. This complicates the splitting of the computational
domain into regions and the application of proper numerical methods modelling
the ﬂow inside the domains.
This paper applies the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [2] to
model plume ﬂow with and without baﬄes, study eﬀects of baﬄe size and shape
on the plume divergence, and plume impingement on the Herschel spacecraft.
This method is a computer simulation of movement and collisions of particles
and it applies a statistical approach to perform the collisions. This is the most
widely used numerical method in the area of rareﬁed gas dynamics and it was
successfully applied to model plume ﬂows and near continuum ﬂows.

Nozzle and Baﬄe Geometries

Initially, the nozzle had the supersonic part with an half-angle of 15 deg and
exit diameter of 5.45 mm. Temperature of helium at the nozzle inlet is 69 K
and mass ﬂow rate is 1.1 mg/sec. The nozzle creates a rather wide plume with
about 66% of total thrust within a half-cone of 30 deg. An optimization of the
nozzle shape allowed to increase a plume collimation and achieve a plume shape
with 74% of total thrust inside a half-cone of 30 deg. The optimal nozzle has
a larger supersonic part: the half-cone angle of 32 deg and exit diameter of 15
mm (Fig. 1 left). However, this nozzle does not meet the design goal, 95%, and
plume still impinges on the Herschel spacecraft surface. Figure 1 right shows
the surface distribution of torque created by the plumes. The plumes impinge
mainly the SVM shield, spacecraft body and the radiators creating a torque
acting on the spacecraft body. To decrease further the plume divergence, the

Numerical Approach

Modeling of plume ﬂow is quite complex from a numerical view point because
as it includes diﬀerent ﬂow regimes, a continuum regime in the nozzle and transitional and free-molecular in the far plume ﬁeld. For the Herschel small nozzle the transitional regime occurs already inside the nozzle due to the small
mass ﬂow rate. For example, values of local Knudsen number are larger then a
threshold value 0.1, which deﬁnes a border between continuum and transitional
regimes (see Fig. 1 left). Therefore, the kinetic approach has to be applied inside
the nozzle already. Computations were performed with DSMC-based software,
SMILE [3]. The software has 20 year history of development and is validated
mutually. A variable hard sphere model [2] was applied to model intermolecular

584

G. Markelov and J. Kroeker

collisions and diﬀuse reﬂection with complete energy accommodation was used
as a gas/surface interaction model.
To perform collisions between model particles, SMILE uses the Cartesian
uniform grid. Each cell of the grid can be subdivided into smaller Cartesian cells
to meet the method requirements on a linear size of the collisional cell. This
allows implementation of an eﬃcient algorithm to trace the model particles. The
uniform cells are used as a base for other algorithms: radial weights and parallel
algorithms. The radial weight is assigned for each cells strip along X-axis to
control a number of the model particles and make their distribution more uniform
in radial direction. A parallel algorithm applies a static distribution of these cells
between processors and cells are distributed to the processors on statistical base.
In this case all processors communicate with each other. However, this algorithm
allows a good load balance for a small number of processors and, as a result, an
eﬃcient use of the parallel computer [4]. It is desirable to have the cells small
enough to make these algorithms eﬃcient.
The plume has to be computed up to a distance of 0.5 meters from the nozzle
and collisional cells have to be small inside the nozzle and large in the plume
far ﬁeld. By adaptation of the uniform cells (subdivision into smaller collisional
cells) the ﬂow resolution in any place of computational domain can be achieved.
However, even for a grid 1000x1000 cells in axial and radial directions, respectively, the nozzle locates inside two/three cells. This leads to very ineﬃcient use
of the software due to large load imbalance over processors and requires large
computer resources. To reduce requirements to computer resources, a computation of nozzle and plume ﬂows has been split into the following two successive
computations:
1. modeling of ﬂow inside the nozzle and in the vicinity of the nozzle exit,
2. modeling of the nozzle ﬂow from the nozzle throat and plume ﬂow.
The two-step approach allows us to reduce the requirements, signiﬁcantly. An
additional beneﬁt is that the ﬁrst computation has been done only once for all
the baﬄe geometries and it requires more computer resources then the second
computation. Numerical solutions inside the supersonic part of the nozzle are
exactly the same for both computations. In principal, the second computation
could be started using an inﬂow boundary located downstream from the nozzle
throat. In this case, a velocity distribution function has to be sampled along this
boundary. Otherwise, any simpliﬁcation of the function, for example, application
of ellipsoidal Maxwellian decreases the solution accuracy.
For the ﬁrst computation an eﬃciency of the computational cluster used is
not less then 85% using up to 28 processors. However, the second computation
is very ineﬃcient as the nozzle ﬂow occupies a few cells only, which yields a
poor load balancing. For example, an increase of number of processors from 2
to 8 yields a growth of wall clock time required to perform the computation.
An improvement has been achieved by redistributing the cells over processors.
For the redistribution, the computation has been stopped at certain moments
and the work load has been estimated for each cell by comparing the time spent

by each processor and number of model particles in that cell. Then cells were
grouped along Y-axis to have an approximately equal work load over the groups.
This redistribution also reduces the communication between processors as each
processor has now a closed sub-domain and not loose cells in the entire computational domain. After this cell redistribution the eﬃciency has been increased
up to 80% using four processors.

Numerical Results

Computations of plume ﬂow have been performed for the optimal nozzle geometry. This section uses the following parameters to describe plume properties at
a distance of 0.5 m from the nozzle. t30 is the fraction of total thrust, t, within
˙
a half-angle of 30 deg, α95 is a half-angle, which includes 95% of total thrust. m
and ta are mass ﬂow rate and thrust along a plume centerline.
4.1

Cylindrical Tube

A geometry of the cylindrical tube is deﬁned by two parameters, length and
radius. Computations have been performed to study eﬀects of both parameters
on the plume divergence and the obtained results are shown in this section.
Eﬀect of the tube length. The cylindrical tubes with a length of Lb = 63, 100,
and 250 mm have been considered. The tube diameter is calculated assuming
that the tube trailing edge is deﬁned by a half-cone angle of φ = 30 deg. A tip
of the cone is near the beginning of the throat.
Figures 3 and 4 show Mach number ﬂow ﬁelds for all these tubes. Helium
atoms reﬂect on the tube surface in accordance with diﬀuse reﬂection. Some
of Helium atoms go back to the nozzle and disturb the plume near ﬁeld ﬂow.
An application of the tube makes the plume more collimated in terms of t30
(Table 1). However, tubes with 63-100 mm length create a more divergent plume
in terms of α95 parameter. Only an application of 250 mm tube leads to very
collimated plume with t30 = 0.901, which is close to the design goal of the
Herschel small nozzles.
The inﬂuence of the tube on the plume structure is clearly seen using a density
distribution at a distance of 0.5 m from the nozzle (Fig. 4 right). The tube creates
a sudden drop in the density distribution at 30 deg half-cone angle and this drop
is larger and sharper for larger tube lengths. Tubes with a length of 63-100 mm
create lower density at angles less than 15 deg. The tube with the length of 250
mm provides higher density for angles up to 30 deg and lower density at larger
angles comparing with the plume created by the bare nozzle.
Due to an open left hand end of the tube, 0.1 mg/sec Helium is released in
the opposite direction for the 250 mm tube. When the left hand end is closed,
Helium ﬂows only along X direction. However, the closed end causes a slight
plume divergence, for example, 100 mm tube creates a wider plume as the open
tube with 63 mm length (cf. Tables 1 and 2).

Eﬀect of the tube radius. The eﬀect has been investigated for tubes with a
length of 100 mm and 250 mm. The radius of 100 mm tube was decreased from
58.34 mm down to 40 mm. As a result, the trailing edge of the baﬄe is on the
half-cone angle of φ = 20 deg. From an intuitive view-point, this should increase
the plume collimation. However, a small baﬄe leads to a large disturbance of the
ﬂow in the near plume ﬁeld where intermolecular collisions occur. As a result,

the tube with a radius of 40 mm creates a plume wider than the bare nozzle
does (Table 3). Figure 5 shows that the density distribution for this plume does
not have the signiﬁcant drop at 20 deg and the density in the core ﬂow is lower
then the correspondent values for larger tube radius.
A decrease of the tube radius for 250 mm length yields also a wider plume. In
this case the baﬄe surface is still far from the nozzle (cf. Figs. 4 left and 5 right)
and the plume is more collimated than without the baﬄe. The decrease of the
tube radius does not aﬀect the density distribution for small angles. However,
the density drop is not big as it is for larger tube radius and, as a result, density
is higher at angles larger than 30 deg.
4.2

Conical Baﬄe

Various conical baﬄes have been considered with half-cone angles of 5, 10, 15,
and 20 deg. The length of the baﬄes is set to Lb = 100 mm. The trailing edge

position is deﬁned by a half-cone angle of 30 deg. Figures 6 and 7 show Mach
number ﬂow-ﬁelds for these baﬄes. An increase of the baﬄe angle decreases very
slightly the plume collimation in terms of t30 (Table 4). The plausible reason is
that the larger portion of Helium ﬂux is emitted along X direction. At the same
time the increase of β leads to more collimated plume in terms of α95 .
4.3

Conclusions

The Herschel spacecraft uses Helium to cool scientiﬁc instruments and to compensate the torque caused by the solar pressure acting on the spacecraft surface.
The Helium is emitted through small nozzles and their design has to provide a
minimum plume impingement. The ﬂow in the nozzles and in the plume passes
from continuum regime through transitional to free-molecular regime and only
kinetic approach could handle such ﬂows. The kinetic approach, namely, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been applied to perform a numerical
analysis.

A straightforward application of DSMC-based software, SMILE, would have
required enormous computer resources to model the nozzle and plume ﬂows with
the required accuracy. Consequently the nozzle and plume ﬂow analyses have
been split into two successive computations. In the ﬁrst analysis the ﬂow inside
entire nozzle has been computed and then subsequent a computation of a ﬂow
in the supersonic part of nozzle and plume ﬂow has been performed. The second
computation has used as boundary conditions the results of the ﬁrst analysis.
This allowed us to reduce signiﬁcantly requirements to computer resources and
achieved the required accuracy.
To decrease the plume divergence and, hence, plume impingement on the
spacecraft surface, the application of various baﬄe shapes, cylinders and cones,
were investigated. It was shown that the small baﬄes created even a wider
plume than a bare nozzle. An increase of radius/length of the cylindrical baﬄe
decreases the plume divergence. The baﬄe with largest length and radius showed
the best performance, close to the requirement. The application of the conical
baﬄe increase the plume collimation, but no signiﬁcant eﬀect of the half-cone
angle was observed.
