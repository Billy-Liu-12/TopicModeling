Abstract. Adaptive algorithm consists of many diﬀerent parameters.
For example, adaptive index, adaptive criterion and stopping criterion.
The adaptivity index drives the adaptive algorithm by selecting some
elements for further reﬁnement. Apart from the driving force, another
important aspect of an algorithm is its stopping criteria. We present a
new stopping criterion for adaptive algorithm.

Introduction

Convergence rate of ﬁnite volume on uniform meshes depends on the regularity
or singularity of the solution. We develop ﬁnite volume on adaptive meshes.
And, we present pointwise or inﬁnity convergence of the developed method. It is
shown that the convergence of the presented adaptive method is independent of
the regularity or singularity of the underlying problem. An adaptive techniques
depend on several factors such as error indicator and adaptive algorithm. We
present a simple adaptive criterion and adaptive algorithm.
Now let us consider the steady state pressure equation of a single phase ﬂowing
in a porous medium Ω

on ∂ΩD .

(2)

Here, Ω is a polyhedral domain in R2 , the source function f is assumed to be
in L2 (Ω), and the diagonal tensor coeﬃcient K(x, y) is positive deﬁnite and
piecewise constant. The coeﬃcient K is allowed to be discontinuous in space.
In porous media ﬂow [7,4,1], the unknown function p = p(x, y) represents the
pressure of a single phase, K is the permeability or hydraulic conductivity of the
porous medium, and the velocity u of the phase is given by the Darcy law as :
u = −K grad p. The next section presents ﬁnite volume method and adaptive
algorithm.

Finite Volume Discretization and Adaptive Algorithm

For solving partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) in a domain, by numerical methods such as ﬁnite volume, the domain is divided into smaller elements called

Here, Fi is the ﬂux through the interface i. Now let us compute the ﬂux for the
interface MN shared by the cells 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1(a)). The ﬂux [12,13,14,7]
through the edge MN is given as
FMN = ΦMN (p2 − p1 ) ,

Here, K1 and K2 refers to the permeability of the cells 1 and 2 in Fig. 1(a).
The perpendicular distance of the interface MN from the center of cell 1 is h1 .
Similarly, h2 is the perpendicular distance of the interface MN from the center of
cell 2. The length of interface MN is l. Adaptive discretization can result in a nonmatching grid as shown in Fig. 1(b). We are using the same ﬂux approximation
for computing ﬂux on a non matching grid.
We are using the following expression for computing the error from the cell i
in a mesh [7],

It can be seen from the above deﬁnition of adaptivity index. For a cell with zero
error ( = 0), the adaptivity index η is zero, and for a cell with maximum error
η is 1. Thus for any cell, the adaptivity index ηi will be in the range [0, 1]. It
can be seen in the Algorithm 1 that the driving force for the Algorithm is the
adaptivity index η.
The adaptivity index (7) drives the Algorithm 1 by selecting some ﬁnite volumes for further reﬁnement. Apart from the driving force, another important
aspect of an algorithm is its stopping criteria. The two obvious stopping criteria of an adaptive algorithm are the maximum allowable degrees of freedom
(DOFmax ) or the maximum allowed mesh reﬁnement, and the maximum allowed
adaptive iteration steps “Iter ≤ Itermax ”.
For deﬁning third criterion, let us compute maximum error associated with a
ﬁnite volume or cell on a mesh formed after k iterative steps of the algorithm.
Let this error be ξk . Thus,
ξk = max i ,
i∈cells

Thus, ξ0 is the maximum error of a cell on the initial mesh. Our third stopping
criterion is deﬁned as
ξk
≥ tol .
ξ0
The third criterion “ξk /ξ0 ≥ tol” is the error reduction after k iteration steps
of the adaptive algorithm. Here, ξk denotes the maximum error (maximum value
of i on a mesh) on an adaptively reﬁned mesh after k iteration steps of the
adaptive Algorithm 1. The quantity ξk /ξ0 , which measures the reduction of the
posteriori error estimate i , provides information of the relative error reduction.
Thus, ξk /ξ0 can be used as a stopping criterion apart from the maximum number
of degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom and maximum iteration of the
adaptive algorithm do not provide information about the error reduction.
Algorithm 1 is used for adaptive reﬁnement. When a ﬁnite volume is selected
for further reﬁnement based on the value of the adaptivity index (7), this ﬁnite
volume is divided into four equal ﬁnite volumes. During the adaptive reﬁnement
process all ﬁnite volumes Ωi in a mesh, for which the adaptivity index ηi is
greater than a given tolerance δ, are reﬁned. The tolerance δ lies between the
values 0 and 1. Tolerance δ equal to 0 means uniform reﬁnement (reﬁne all ﬁnite
volumes), and tolerance δ equal to 1 means that the adaptive algorithm will
reﬁne a single ﬁnite volume per iteration step which can be costly. Both of these
values can be computationally expensive and may not be optimal. A small δ will

reﬁne many ﬁnite volumes and thus introduce many new cells per iteration step
of the adaptive algorithm. On the other hand, a large value of δ will reﬁne fewer
cells and thus introduce fewer new ﬁnite volumes per iteration step. It should be
kept in mind that during each iteration step of the adaptive algorithm a discrete
system needs to be solved. Typically a value of δ = 0.5 is used [15].
To measure the eﬀectiveness of the adaptivity index (7) in selecting the cells
with maximum error, we use the relation
def

Γ =

Cell number with η = 1.0
.
Cell number with maximum point-wise error |p − ph |

(8)

Here, Γ is the robustness of the indicator η. If Γ is close to 1, the cells with the
maximum point-wise error and the cells with the maximum error given by the
error indicator (6) are the same. We compute the robustness quantity Γ of the
adaptive index during each iteration step of the adaptive Algorithm 1.

Numerical Examples

Let p be the exact solution vector, and ph be the ﬁnite volume solution vector
on a mesh. Let us further assume that pk be the exact pressure at the center of
the cell k and pkh be the discrete pressure by the ﬁnite volume approximation for
the same location. Error in the L∞ norm is deﬁned as
p − ph

The ﬁnite volume solution is enforced inside the domain by the Dirichlet

equations formed on the sequence of adaptive and uniform meshes, we are using
the ILU preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (CG) iterative solver unless mentioned otherwise. Let the domain be Ω = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1], and it is divided into
four sub-domains according to the permeability K (see Fig. 2). Let the permeability in the sub-domain Ωi be Ki . It is assumed that the permeability in the
sub-domain Ω1 is equal to the permeability in the sub-domain Ω3 , and the permeability in the sub-domain Ω2 is equal to the permeability in the sub-domain
Ω4 . That is K1 = K3 and K2 = K4 . Let us further assume that K1 = K3 = R
and K2 = K4 = 1. The parameter R is deﬁned below. Let the exact solution in
polar form be
p(r, θ) = rγ η(θ) ,

[8,9]. The parameter γ denotes the singularity in the solution [9], and it depends
on the permeability distribution in the domain. For the singularity γ = 0.1, the

The constrained nonlinear Equations (12) can be solved for the parameters R, σ,
and ρ by Newton’s iteration algorithm for diﬀerent degrees of singularity γ. The
∂p
analytical solution p(r, θ) satisﬁes the usual interface conditions : p and K ∂n
are continuous across the interfaces. It can be shown that the solution p belongs
in the fractional Sobolev space H1+κ (Ω) (κ < γ) [10].
Let the singularity be γ = 0.1. Various parameters that satisfy the relations
(12) under the constraints (13) are
R ≈ 161.4476 ,

ρ ≈ 0.7854 and σ ≈ −14.9225 .

The permeability distribution is shown in Figure 3. The exact solution belongs
to the fractional Sobolev space H1+k (k < 0.1). We have solved this problem on

in Figs. 4 and 5. Figure 4(a) is a surface plot of the exact solution. The solution
is singular at the origin. Figure 4(b) presents a surface plot of the error. It can
be seen that the error is maximum at the singularity. Figure 5 compares the
convergence behaviour on adaptive and uniform meshes in the L∞ norm. We
did not notice any convergence in the L∞ norm on uniform meshes till one
million degrees of freedom. A similar behaviour was also observed in [11] on
uniform meshes for singular problems. It was suggested in [11] that adaptive
meshes may be ideal for such solutions. On adaptive meshes, we are getting
P
p − ph L∞ ≈ DOF− /2 with the convergence P ≈ 1 (see Figure 5). Because of
the regularity of the solution, this convergence is quasi optimal [9,8].

the robustness is almost always equal to 1.0 for all of the adaptive iterations.
It means that the cells with the maximum point-wise error and cells with the
maximum value of the error indicator given by the equation 6 are the same.
