Abstract. The sound emitted from splash of water droplet colliding with shallow water is simulated by the finite difference lattice Boltzmann method. Twoparticle immiscible fluid model is used, and the under water sound is considered
by introducing the elasticity for the liquid phase. After the collision, sounds
propagating into the gas and liquid phases are successively detected. The directivity of the sound is shown to depend on the depth of the water.
Keywords: Finite difference lattice Boltzmann method, Aero-acoustics, Twophase flow, Two-fluid interface.

1 Introduction
The sounds generated at interfaces between liquid and gas are commonly heard in
ordinary life such as sound from raindrops and so on. But the mechanism is still not
clear because the scales of motion of the interface and sound are very different and
the experimental investigations are still hard. It is also still very difficult to calculate
sound waves and deformation of interfaces simultaneously. As to the fluid dynamic
sound, direct simulations have become popular by using high-resolution schemes.
On the other hand, many calculation methods for interfaces have been developed.
MAC (Marker And Cell) [1], VOF (Volume Of Fluid) [2] and LS (Level-Set) [3]
methods are widely used. However, these methods sometimes suffer the lack of conservation of volume. CIP (Cubic- Interpolated Pseudo-particle [4]) has been considered to reduce the diffusivity at the interface.
Immiscible models based on the LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method), which are excellent in conservation of volume or mass, have been developed [5,6] for simulation
of multi-phase flows. In this paper, we present a two-particle model for two-phase
flows, gas and liquid, considering large density difference, surface tension effect, and
compressibility of the liquid phase.

2 Basic Equations
2.1 Discrete BGK Equation
The basic equation for the finite difference lattice Boltzmann method is the following
discrete BGK equation [7]
(1)
where f i is the distribution function which is the number density of the particle having velocity ciα and subscripts i represents the direction of particle translation and α
is the Cartesian co-ordinates. fi eq is the local equilibrium distribution function. The
term on the right hand side represents the collision of particles and τ is called the
single relaxation time factor. Superscript k represents gas and liquid phases, and we
will use two particle model and k = G represents gas phase and k = L liquid phase,
respectively.
Macroscopic variables, density ρ , flow velocity u , and internal energy e are obtained by
(2)
(3)
(4)
where m represents the number of the particles. The pressure P = ρ e and sound
p
speed in gas phase csG = 2e for two-dimensional flows.
2.2 Interface Treatment
In order to obtain sharp interface for immiscible two-particle model, artificial separation techniques [5] are sometimes introduced. In this study, phase separation or recolor technique by Latva-Kokko et al [8,9] is employed.
In this technique, an additional term is introduced to the discrete BGK equation
as
(5)
where fi ′k is re-distributed function calculated from the gradient of the interface. fi ′k
is given by

273

(6a,b)

where κ is a parameter to control the thickness of the diffusive interface and
f i eqk (0) is the equilibrium distribution function for velocity zero considering the natural or pure diffusion. Each sum of fi ′G , f i ′L is not changed at the collision, and then
the density, the momentum and the energy are conserved. ϕ is the angle between the
gradient of the density and the particle velocity and given by
(7)
(8)
2.3 Introduction of External Forces
External forces are introduced [10] to the discrete BGK equation as
(9)
where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Alternatively, the force
is introduced to the equilibrium distribution function as an impulsive force, and we
employ the latter technique
The equilibrium distribution function fi eqk = fi eqk ( t , ρ k , uα ) is modified by the external force Fα as
(10)
(11)
(12)
where W is the work done by the external force, and give by
(13)

2.4 Surface Tension
We employ a model proposed by Gunstensen [11] and Continuum Surface Force
(CSF) method [12]. In CSF, the surface tension force FS is given by
(14)

274

where σ is the surface (interfacial) tension coefficient Κ is the curvature of the interface, nˆ is the normal unit vector of the interface, and nˆ ( x ) = n ( x ) n ( x ) . The
normal vector on the interface n ( x ) is calculated by
(15)
The curvature Κ is also calculated by
(16)

2.5 Model for Two Fluids with Large Density Difference
He et al [13] have proposed a large density difference fluid model up to about 40, and
Inamuro et al [14] have proposed a model with density difference up to 1000. But the
fluid of liquid phase is completely incompressible in Inamuro’s model, and the sound
in liquid phase can not simulated by his model. Therefore we will propose a novel
model for two-phase flows with large density difference. The density difference is
realized by changing the acceleration, and this effect is also introduced to the model
by impulsive force for each particle
(17)

where P′ is the effective pressure, and a is the acceleration to cancel the original
force term, a′ is newly introduced acceleration due to the density and the viscosity of
considering fluid. m represents an averaged density and μ ′ is an averaged viscosity
(18a,b)
The density ratio of the two fluids is given as mL / mG , and in case of water and air,
it is about 800, and the ratio of viscosity is about 70 and they change continuously
across the interface.

2.6 Compressibility of Liquid
A simple model of bulk elasticity is introduced to consider the compressibility of the
liquid as
(19)

Simulation of Sound Emitted from Collision of Droplet with Shallow Water

275

where β is a parameter to control the elasticity and corresponds the bulk (elasticity)
modulus and P0 is a reference pressure and ρ0 is a reference density and is fixed to
unity in this study. In liquid phase, we do not consider the temperature change.

3 Two-Dimensional Thermal Model
3.1 Two-Dimensional 21 Velocity Model
In this study, two-dimensional thermal 21-velocity (D2Q21) model [15,16] is used,
whose equilibrium distribution function is given by
(20)
The velocity set and the coefficients are shown in Fig.1, Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

0.32, 0.5, and 1. Full marks represent the sound speed of original FDLBM on each internal
energy. The sound speed of liquid depends on only bulk elasticity modulus.

3.2 Sound Speed of Liquid Phase
The sound speed of the liquid phase is given as
(21)
In order to check the sound speed, we calculated very weak pressure wave by a piston problem. The results are shown in Fig. 2, and the relation given above is shown to

be satisfied. This result does not depend on numerical scheme. If we consider a system consists of water and air, the ratio of both sound speeds is about 4.4 and β m
can be adequately chosen.

4 Sound Generated by Collision of a Water Drop on a Shallow
Water
The sound generated by rain drops is a very well-known sound, and intensive studies
have been done [17]. In this repot, we calculated the sound generated by collision of a
water drop to shallow water using the above mentioned model. The reason why we
chose this problem is that the results, such as splash shape except sound, can be compared with other simulation results.
In this calculation, we did not impose the gravitational force, because some internal
compression waves are generated just after the gravitational force is imposed. Instead,
the initial velocity was imposed as shown in Fig. 3. Space differential is discretized
by the third order upwind scheme (UTOPIA) and time integration is done by the second order Runge-Kutta method. The parameters of the calculation are given as
follows.
The number of grids is 503 × 401 and the minimum grid size is 2 ×10−5 . Time increment is set 2 × 10−6 . The density ratio mL / mG = 1000 , kinematic viscosity of gas
ν G = 1 ×10 −6 , and the bulk elastic modulus of liquid is 6400. The phase separation coef-

ficient κ = 0.9 , the surface tension coefficient σ = 1×10 −7 , the droplet diameter
D = 2 ×10−3 , the water depth D f = 0.075 D , and the initial velocity of the droplet
U = 0.02 . It should be noted here that these parameters are all non-dimensional values based on the minimum particle speed c = 1 , the reference time t = 1 , and the ref-

erence length c / t = 1 .

Figure 4 shows the relationship between another non-dimensional time t* = Ut / D
and space factor r* = r / D , where U is the initial velocity of the drop, D is the diameter of the drop and r is the radius of the splash root. The relationship fits well to
a power law.
The sound generated at the collision is shown in Fig. 5. Sounds propagating into
the gas phase and also into the liquid phase are simultaneously shown there. The
sound generated by the deformation of the drop (round shaped sound) and generated
by the underwater sound (sound speed is 4.4 times larger than the former) are clearly

presented. It should be noted that small gas bubbles are also generated and caught by
water. Figure 6 shows that the sound propagating into gas phase has complicated directivity, and that the directivity depends on the depth of the water.

5 Conclusion
A two-phase-flow model with large density difference and including the elasticity of
liquid is proposed and simulation of sound generated when a water droplet collides
with shallow water was performed. The sounds propagating into gas and liquid phases
were successively simulated.
