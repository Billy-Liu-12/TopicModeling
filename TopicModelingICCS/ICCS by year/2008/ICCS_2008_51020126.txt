Abstract. In a wide range of industrial applications there appear systems of hard particles of diﬀerent shapes and sizes, known as “packings”.
In this work, the force-biased algorithm, primarily designed to model
close packings of equal spheres, is adapted to simulate mixtures of spherocylindrical particles of diﬀerent radii and aspect ratios. The packing
densities of simulated mono and polydisperse systems, are presented as
functions of particle elongation and diﬀerent algorithm parameters. It is
shown that spherocylinders can pack more densely than spheres, reaching
volume fraction as high as 0.705.

Introduction

Historically, dense random close packings (RCP) of spheres were considered as
a model for the structure of liquids, especially those of the noble gases. RCP
was viewed as a well-deﬁned state [1] with density φ ≈ 0.6366. This value was
obtained in experiments [2] [3] as well as computer simulations [4]. Later work by
Jodrey and Tory [5] and Mo´sci´
nski et al. [6] showed that higher densities could
be easily obtained at the cost od increasing the order in the sphere system. Since
the precise deﬁnition of “randomness” is lacking, the distinction between ordered
and random is not absolute. Bargiel and Tory [7] introduced the measure of local
disorder as the deviation of each 13-sphere complex from the corresponding
fragment of either f.c.c. or h.c.p. lattice. The global disorder is then deﬁned
as the average local disorder (see formulae (21) to (23) of [7]). This measure
enables to identify crystalline or nearly crystalline regions and hence to track
the transition from RCP to the higher densities and determine the extent to
which the greater density increases the order. Approximating the fraction of
quasi-crystalline fragments (f.c.c. or h.c.p.) versus packing density they observed
that the ﬁrst crystalline fragments begin to form in the random structure at
φ ≈ 0.6366 (see Fig. 7 and Table 6 of [7]), the value close to the earlier predictions
for RCP.
Recently, Torquato et al. [8] described RCP is an ill-deﬁned state and introduced the concept of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) state [9] [10],
corresponding to the least ordered among all jammed packings. For a variety of
order metrics, it appears that the MRJ state has a density of φ ≈ 0.6366 and
again is consistent with what has been thought of as RCP [11].

Geometrical Properties of Simulated Packings of Spherocylinders

There exist a wide spectrum of experimental and computational algorithms
that can produce packings of equal spheres of diﬀerent porosity and geometrical
properties [12] [13] [6] [14] [15] [4] [5] [16]. However, in many applications we
have to deal with granular systems of hard particles which are far from spherical.
Those non-spherical particles have to be treated in quite diﬀerent way due to
their additional rotational degrees of freedom.
Recently, Donev et al. [17] [18] and independently Bezrukov et al. [19] adapted
some of the known algorithms to produce random packings of ellipsoids. Donev
et al. [20] experimented with two kinds of M&M’s R Candies, and then they
generalized the well known Lubaschevsky-Stillinger algorithm (LS) [12] [13] to
handle ellipsoids. In both cases (experiment and simulation) they obtained high
volume fractions (up to 0.71). Abreu et al. [21] used the Monte Carlo technique
to study the packings of spherocylinders in the presence of gravitational ﬁeld.
In this paper we used the adaptation of the force-biased (FB) algorithm [6]
[14] to produce dense random packings of spherocylinders. The reason for this
choice is that spherocylinders are excellent model for particles from spherical
to very elongated (rod-like) depending on their aspect ratio. Furthermore there
exists an eﬃcient algorithm to calculate the distance between two spherocylinders and to detect potential overlaps [22] [21], which is crucial in practically
any dense packing simulation process. Furthermore, Allen et al. [23] argue, that
spherocylinders show a smectic phase (while ellipsoids do not), since they can
be mapped onto the hard sphere ﬂuid by the global change of scale.
We tested two systems of hard spherocylinders: isotropic and nematic. In the
isotropic system the spherocylinders have random initial orientation, which is
constant throughout the simulation. To observe the isotropic - nematic transition
we allowed for the rotation of the spherocylinders with diﬀerent ratios. In this
case we obtained much higher densities at the cost of increasing the value of the
nematic order parameter [23].

2.1

The Force-Biased Algorithm
Spheres

The force-biased (FB) algorithm was primarily designed to attain very dense
irregular packings of hard spheres [6] [14]. The initial conﬁguration of the system is a set of N (initially overlapping) spheres centered at r i , i = 1, . . . , N and
of diameter di chosen according to a given distribution function. The algorithm
attempts to eliminate overlaps by pushing apart overlapping particles while gradually reducing their diameters as described in [6] [14]. The spheres are moved
according to the repulsive “force”, F ij , deﬁned between any two overlapping
particles. The new position of the i-th sphere is then given by
ri = ri + ε

F ij ,

(1)

j=i

and
F ij = αij pij

where ε is the scaling factor, and αij is the overlap index
αij =

1 if particles i and j intersect
0 otherwise.

(3)

The pair “potential”, pij , is proportional to the overlap between spheres i and
j. For monosized spheres (of diameter d) the deﬁnition of pij , is straightforward
pij = d (1 −

2
δij
),
d2

(4)

where δij is the distance between the centers of the spheres i and j, i.e.
2
δij
= |r ij |2 .

(5)

However, (4) cannot be applied eﬃciently to spheres of diﬀerent diameters (especially when the diﬀerence in sizes is large). Hence, for diameters of arbitrary distribution, another potential function was devised (similar to those given in [19])
pij = d1

For equal particles di = d, i = 1, . . . , N and (6) simpliﬁes to (4).
2.2

Adaptation to Spherocylinders

Using spherocylinders instead of spheres complicates the algorithm for couple of
reasons. Firstly, a spherocylinder, i, is described by four parameters. In addition
to its diameter, di , and spatial position, r i , we have to consider the length of its
cylindrical portion, li , and orientation of its main axis, given by a unit vector ui .
What is more important, the overlap detection and calculating the potential function between two spherocylinders is much more complicated than for the case of
spheres. Vega and Lago [22] proposed a very eﬃcient algorithm for locating the
minimum distance between spherocylinders, later improved by Abreu et al. [21].
This algorithm uses the notion of a shaft of a spherocylinder as the main axis of
its cylindrical portion. The coordinates of any point of a shaft i are given by
si = ri + λi ui ,

(7)

where λi ∈ [−li /2, li /2]. Spherocylinders i and j overlap if the shortest distance
between their shafts, δij , is less then the sum of their radii, that is, when δij <
∗(j)
∗(i)
(di + dj )/2. Let q i = ri + λi ui and q j = rj + λj uj are the points on shafts
i and j, respectively, closest to each other. Then
∗(i)

δ ij = q j − q i = rij + λj

∗(j)

uj − λi

ui

(8)

is the vector connecting the closest points of shafts i and j, and
2
= |δ ij |2 .
δij

(9)

129

For parallel shafts (e.i. when |ui · uj |2 = 1) their distance can be expressed as
2
= |r ij |2 − |ui · r ij |2 + max(0, |ui · r ij | −
δij

li + lj
)

.

(10)

Equation (10) can be applied for calculating overlaps between a sphere and a
spherocylinder. A sphere i can be considered as a spherocylinder of null length
(li = 0) and parallel to particle j (ui = uj or ui = −uj ). Obviously when
li = lj = 0 (both particles are spheres) we get (5).
In addition to shifting the positions of the particles (see (1)), the spherocylinders can be rotated according to
⎞

where prij is the rotational potential
prij = 1 −

,

(12)

δ rij is the projection of δ ij onto the plane perpendicular to ui , given by
δ rij = δ ij − ui (δ ij · ui ) ,

(13)

εr is the scaling factor, and n(x) = x/|x| is the unit vector in the direction of x.
In the case of spheres, when all the overlaps are eliminated, the algorithm
stops. For spherocylinders the density can be further increased when, after elimination of overlaps, the size of the particles is increased by a certain factor and
the overlap elimination process is repeated. This is done until further densiﬁcation is not possible.

Results

We present results obtained from the FB algorithm for monodisperse systems
and binary mixtures of spherocylinders. The objective of this study was to verify
the inﬂuence of the particle size distribution, shape (e.i. the aspect ratio), and
rotation factor, εr , on the packing density and the orientational order of the
system represented by the nematic order parameter, S.

Monodisperse Systems

In this section the packing fraction of the monodisperse beds of spherocylinders
is studied using the FB algorithm. Each simulation was performed in a cubic
container with periodic boundary conditions. We used systems of N particles
of aspect ratios, γ, ranging from 0 (spheres) to 80 (very long rods). The value

of N was 2000 for γ ≤ 20 but it had to be increased to 6000 for γ = 40 and
to 15000 for γ = 80 due to the periodic boundary condition requirements, that
size of any particle cannot exceed half of the computational box length, L. For
monodisperse packings the number of spheres required, N , can be estimated
on the basis of the nominal packing density, η0 , which never can be exceeded
by the actual volume fraction. For details on the meaning of the nominal and
actual packing densities see [6] [14]. Additionally, if d0 is the diameter of the
spherocylinder corresponding to η0 , its volume, v0 , is given by
v0 =

(1.5γ + 1) .

We start from the isotropic conﬁguration in which particle centers are uniformly
distributed in the box and orientations are taken uniformly from the unit sphere.
By setting εr = 0 we disable rotations and ensure that the ﬁnal orientations
are globally isotropic. It is possible, however, that some positional order will
appear in the ﬁnal conﬁguration. When εr > 0 rotations are allowed and some
orientational order can appear as well. We measure the degree of orientational
order calculating the well known nematic order parameter, S, [23].
The results obtained for spherocylinders depended strongly on the aspect
ratio, γ. Images (formed by the Persistence of Vision Raytracer, povray, version
3.6.1 [24]) of the random packings for several aspect ratios may be seen in Fig. 1.
In all cases rotations were allowed (εr = 0.02).
Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the ﬁnal packing density on the aspect ratio
for diﬀerent values of the rotation factor, εr , while Fig. 3 presents the same
dependance for ε = 0.1, εr = 0.02 and it covers much wider range of aspect
ratios. Each point is an average over 10 runs. It is apparent from the ﬁgures that
the packing density increases with γ up to a certain value. Further increase of γ

sity of the bidisperse mixture on the aspect ratios, γ1 and γ2 , for ε = 0.1 and

causes a density decrease. That means that there exists an aspect ratio, γm , for
which spherocylinders can be packed the densest. This value does not depend
on the rotation factor, although obviously the densities obtained for various εr
are diﬀerent. The experimental points in Fig. 3 lie on the line φ = 4.5/γ (solid
line in the ﬁgure) for γ > 10, which is in very good agreement with theory [21].
Fig. 4 shows the development of the orientational order in the system, represented by the nematic order parameter, S, vs. γ, and εr . As could be expected
the nematic order parameter is very small (below 0.02) for εr = 0, since in this
case no rotations are allowed and the directional order remains random. For
εr = 0.02 and ε = 0.1 values of S are only slightly higher but for εr = 0.02 and
ε = 0.4, S reaches almost 0.08. This is the eﬀect of much faster movement which
enables spherocylinders of similar orientation to group. This can be observed in
the ﬁgures not shown in this paper.
3.2

Bidisperse Mixtures

Aiming at verifying the eﬀect of particle shape on the packing density and ordering of binary mixtures of spherocylinders, FB simulations were carried out using
two species of particles with diﬀerent aspect ratios. Each species is composed of
certain number of particles (N1 and N2 respectively) with a speciﬁc aspect ratio
(γ1 and γ2 ). In order to focus on shape eﬀects, all the simulated particles have
the same volume.
Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the total packing density of the binary mixture
on the aspect ratios, γ1 , and γ2 . It can be observed that the highest density is
attained for γ1 = γ2 = 0.4 (monodisperse case). The shape of the function φ(γ1 )
is similar for all values of γ2 used, but for γ2 = 0.4 the density is much higher
than for other values. Also only for γ2 = 0.4 there is a characteristic peak of
density.

Conclusions

The force-biased algorithm for obtaining granular packings has been adapted
to handle spherocylinders out to very large aspect ratios. The results for the
spherocylinders reproduce existing experimental results for all available aspect
ratios [21]. The volume fractions of the long spherocylinders conﬁrm the prediction that the random packing density of thin rods is inversely proportional
to the aspect ratio. The agreement is excellent for γ above 10. Our simulation
results also agree fairly well with the available experimental densities. For a
comparison of simulation and experimental packing densities see Fig. 6 of [25].
Most experiments presented relate to granular rods or ﬁbers from a variety of
materials such as wood, metal wire, and raw spaghetti. It is believed that the
scatter of experimental densities are due to factors such as wall eﬀects, friction,
local nematic ordering, and particle ﬂexibility [25].
The random sphere packing density turns out to be a local minimum: the
highest density occurs at an aspect ratio of γ ≈ 0.4. The practical implication is
that a small deviation in shape from spherical may increase the random packing
density signiﬁcantly without crystallization. It is clear that a polydisperse system
of spheres packs more densely than a monodisperse system. For equally sized
closely packed spheres the interstices between the particles are small enough
such that no additional spheres can be placed in them. If the system is made
more and more polydisperse, the smaller spheres may be placed where the larger
ones previously could not. Perturbing the particle shape from spherical has a

134

M. Bargiel

similar eﬀect: a short spherocylinder that may not ﬁt when oriented in a given
direction may ﬁt when the orientation is changed.
Finally, our simulations clearly show that particles with a given aspect ratio have a unique random packing density: The Bernal sphere packing can be
generalized to spherocylinders of arbitrary aspect ratio with one and the same
simulation method. This indicates that these packings all follow the same geometrical principle.
The parameters of the FB algorithm strongly inﬂuence the ﬁnal packing density of a given mixture as well as the orientational ordering of the resulting bed.
Careful choice of these parameters is crucial for the eﬃciency of the algorithm
and properties of the resulting packings. As long as εr = 0 the bed remains
isotropic. When εr > 0 but ε is small (particles are not allowed to move too
quickly) the bed is only slightly more ordered. However, when we increase ε, the
orientational order quickly raises producing packings in the nematic phase.
It should be possible to study other shapes of particle such as ellipsoids and
disks using this method. The only issue here is to ﬁnd an eﬀective algorithm
to calculate the distances between particles of a given shape. Otherwise the
adaptation is straightforward. Since there are many computer and experimental
studies concerning packings of ellipsoids [17] [18] [20], this is the more probable
next step in this research. Also the packing of disks presents an interesting
problem. Nevertheless the geometry of a disk, though simple, shows nontrivial
diﬃculties in the calculations.
