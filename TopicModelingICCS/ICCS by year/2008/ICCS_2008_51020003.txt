Abstract. This short paper is intended to give our readers a brief insight
about the Seventh International Workshop on Computer Graphics and
Geometric Modeling-CGGM’2008, held in Krakow (Poland), June 23-25
2008 as a part of the ICCS’2008 general conference.

CGGM Workshops
Aims and Scope

Computer Graphics (CG) and Geometric Modeling have become two of the most
important and challenging areas of Computer Science. The CGGM workshops
seek for high-quality papers describing original research results in those ﬁelds.
Topics of the workshop include (but not limited to): geometric modeling, solid
modeling, CAD/CAM, physically-based modeling, surface reconstruction, geometric processing and CAGD, volume visualization, virtual avatars, computer
animation, CG in Art, Education, Engineering, Entertainment and Medicine,
rendering techniques, multimedia, non photo-realistic rendering, virtual and augmented reality, virtual environments, illumination models, texture models, CG
and Internet (VRML, Java, X3D, etc.), artiﬁcial intelligence for CG, CG software
and hardware, CG applications, CG education and new directions in CG.

CGGM Workshops History

The history of the CGGM workshops dates back eight years ago, when some
researchers decided to organize a series of international conferences on all aspects of computational science. The ﬁrst edition of this annual conference was
held in San Francisco in 2001 under the name of International Conference on
Computational Science, ICCS. This year ICCS is held in Krakow (Poland).
After ICCS’2001, I realized that no special event devoted to either computer
graphics or geometric modeling had been organized at that conference. Aiming
to ﬁll this gap, I proposed a special session on these topics to ICCS’2002 organizers. Their enthusiastic reply encouraged me to organize the ﬁrst edition of
M. Bubak et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2008, Part II, LNCS 5102, pp. 3–4, 2008.

this workshop, CGGM’2002. A total of 81 papers from 21 countries were submitted to the workshop, with 35 high-quality papers ﬁnally accepted and published
by Springer-Verlag, in its Lectures Notes in Computer Science series, vol. 2330.
This great success and the positive feedback of authors and participants motivated that CGGM became an annual event on its own. Subsequent editions
were held as follows (see [1] for details): CGGM’2003 in Montreal (Canada),
CGGM’2004 in Krakow (Poland), CGGM’2005 in Atlanta (USA), CGGM’2006
in Reading (UK) and CGGM’2007 in Beijing (China). All of them were published
by Springer-Verlag, in its Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, volumes
2668, 3039, 3515, 3992 and 4488 with a total of 52, 24, 22, 22 and 20 contributions, respectively. In addition, one Special issue has been published in 2004 in
the Future Generation Computer Systems – FGCS journal [2]. Another special
issue on CGGM’2007 is in the way to be published this year in the Advances in
Computational Science and Technology-ACST journal [3].

CGGM’2008

This year CGGM has received a total of 39 papers of which 17 have been accepted as full papers and 1 as short paper. The reader is referred to [4] for more
information about the workshop. The workshop chair would like to thank the
authors, including those whose papers were not accepted, for their contributions.
I also thank the referees (see the CGGM’2008 International Program Committee and CGGM’2008 International Reviewer Board in [4]) for their hard work in
reviewing the papers and making constructive comments and suggestions, which
have substantially contributed to improving the workshop.
It is expected that some workshop papers will be selected for publication
in extended and updated form in a Special Issue on CGGM’2008. Details will
appear in [4] at due time.
Acknowledgements. This workshop has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, National Program of Computer Science, Project
Ref. TIN2006-13615. The CGGM’2008 chair also thanks Dick van Albada, workshops chair of general conference ICCS’2008 for his all-time availability and diligent work during all stages of the workshop organization. It is a pleasure to work
with you, Dick!
