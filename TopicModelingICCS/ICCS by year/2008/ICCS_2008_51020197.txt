Abstract. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown in a thin ﬁlm have shown
great potential as cathodes for the development several ﬁeld emission
devices. However, in modeling these important devices we face substantial challenges since the CNTs in a thin ﬁlm undergo complex dynamics
during ﬁeld emission, which includes processes such as (1) evolution, (2)
electromechanical interaction, (3) thermoelectric heating and (4) ballistic
transport. These processes are coupled, nonlinear, and multiphysics in
their nature. Therefore, they must be analyzed accurately from the stability and long-term performance view-point of the device. Fairly detailed
physics-based models of CNTs considering some of these aspects have recently been reported by us. In this paper, we extend these models and
focus on their computational implementation. All components of models
are integrated at the computational level in a systematic manner in order
to accurately calculate main characteristics such as the device current,
which are particularly important for stable performance of CNT thin
ﬁlm cathodes in x-ray devices for precision biomedical instrumentation.
The numerical simulations reported in this paper are able to reproduce
several experimentally observed phenomena, which include ﬂuctuating
ﬁeld emission current, deﬂected CNT tips and the heating process.
Keywords: carbon nanotubes, ﬁeld emission, current density, phonon.

Introduction

Since their discovery in 1991 [1], a substantial interest has been shown for potential applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). As a result, numerous devices
incorporating CNTs have been proposed. Although some of the applications of
CNTs may be realized in distant future, their application as electron ﬁeld emitters already show great potential today [2]. With signiﬁcant improvement in
their growth conditions, they rank among the best emitters that are currently
available. These ﬁled emitting cathodes have several advantages over the conventional thermionic cathodes: (i) current density from ﬁeld emission would be

orders of magnitude greater than in the thermionic case, (ii) a cold cathode
would minimize the need for cooling, and (iii) a ﬁeld emitting cathode can be
miniaturized.
Field emission performance of an isolated CNT is found to be remarkable due
to its structural integrity, high thermal conductivity and geometry. However, the
situation becomes complex for cathodes comprising CNT thin ﬁlms. In this case,
individual CNTs are not always aligned normal to the substrate surface, which
is due to electromechanical interaction among neighboring CNTs. Small spikes
in the current have been observed experimentally [3]. These can be attributed to
change in gap between the CNT tip and the anode plate either due to elongation
of CNTs under high bias voltage or due to degradation/fragmentation of CNTs.
Also, there is a possibility of dynamic contact of pulled up CNT tips with the
anode plate when the bias voltage is very high. In order to stabilize the collective
ﬁeld emission from a CNT based thin ﬁlm, preferential breakdown of a small
number of CNTs is achieved by increasing the bias voltage after initial exposure
to certain low voltage [4]. In addition, the coupled electron-phonon transport
may produce temperature spikes. The temperature can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
electrical conductivity [5]. From the modeling aspect, this becomes a general case,
but is very challenging. In this paper, we extend the results of [6]-[7] and include
some of these aspects, focusing on the device-level performance of CNTs in a
thin ﬁlm. A diode conﬁguration is considered here, where the cathode contains
a CNT thin ﬁlm grown on a metallic substrate. The anode acts as the ﬁeld
emission current collector. A major concern in this work is the inherent coupling
among (i) electromechanical forces causing deformation of CNTs and (ii) the
ballistic electron-phonon transport. From a system perspective, such a detailed
study proves to be useful in understanding the reason behind the experimentally
observed ﬂuctuation in device current, which is undesirable for applications such
as precision x-ray generation biomedical devices.

CNT Field Emission as a Multiphysics Process: The
Development of a Mathematical Model

The physics of ﬁeld emission from a ﬂat metallic substrate is fairly well understood. The current density (J) due to ﬁeld emission from a metallic surface
is usually obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation [8], which can be
expressed as
CΦ3/2
BE 2

J=

(1)
Φ
E
where E is the electric ﬁeld, Φ is the work function for the cathode material, and
B and C are constants. In the CNT thin ﬁlm problem, under the inﬂuence of sufﬁciently high voltage at ultra-high vacuum, the electrons emitted from the CNTs
(mainly from the CNT tip region and emitted parallel to the axis of the tubes)
reach the anode. Unlike the metallic emitters, here the surface of the cathode is
not smooth. The cathode here consists of hollow tubes (CNTs) in curved shapes
and with certain spacings. In addition, certain amount of impurities and carbon

clusters may be present within the otherwise empty spaces in the ﬁlm. Moreover,
the CNTs undergo reorientation due to electromechanical interactions with the
neighbouring CNTs during ﬁeld emission. Analysis of these processes requires
the determination of the current density by considering the individual geometry
of the CNTs, their dynamic orientations and the variation in the electric ﬁeld
during electronic transport.

Fig. 1. CNT array conﬁguration

In the present problem, we consider an array as shown in Fig. 1. A representative volume (Vcell ), which contains several CNTs with a prescribed distribution
of their spacing at the substrate and random distribution of their curved shapes,
is considered for the purpose of modeling. Furthermore, we discretize the CNT
into several segments and nodes by treating each CNT as a 1D nanowire. At
each node, we assign the quantities of interest, such as displacement, electron
density, electric ﬁeld and temperature. Next, governing equations involving these
quantities of interest are derived in a systematic manner. An initial description
of the thin ﬁlm is given in terms of the tip angles and the curved shapes of the
CNTs in Vcell , uniform conduction electron density of unstrained CNTs, a bias
electric ﬁeld and a reference temperature (temperature of the substrate). The
phenomenological model of evolution of CNTs is given by four nonlinear coupled
ordinary diﬀerential equations [6]. Based on this model, the rate of degradation
of CNTs vburn is deﬁned as
vburn = Vcell

s(s − a1 )(s − a2 )(s − a3 )

where n1 is the concentration of carbon atoms in the cluster form in the cell,
a1 , a2 , a3 are lattice constants, s = 12 (a1 + a2 + a3 ), n and m are integers
(n ≥ |m| ≥ 0). The pair (n, m) deﬁnes the chirality of the CNT. Therefore, at a
given time, the length of a CNT can be expressed as h(t) = h0 − vburn t, where
h0 is the initial average height of the CNTs and d is the distance between the
cathode substrate and the anode (see Fig. 1).

is expressed as

where Vs is the constant source potential (on the substrate side), Vd is the drain
potential (on the anode side), G(i, j) is the Green’s function [9] with i being the
ring position, and n
ˆ j denotes the electron density at node position j on the ring.
The ﬁeld emission current (Icell ) from the anode surface associated with Vcell of
the ﬁlm is obtained as
N

Icell = Acell

Jj ,

(5)

j=1

where Acell is the anode surface area and N is the number of CNTs in the volume
element. The total current is obtained by summing the cell-wise current (Icell ).
This formulation takes into account the eﬀect of CNT tip orientations and one
can perform statistical analysis of the device current for randomly distributed
and randomly oriented CNTs. However, due to the deformation of the CNTs due
to electromechanical forces, the evolution process requires a much more detailed
treatment from the mechanics point of view.
Based on the studies reported in published literature [10]-[12], it is reasonable
to expect that a major contribution is by the Lorentz force due to the ﬂow of
electron gas along the CNT and the ponderomotive force due to electrons in the
oscillatory electric ﬁeld. The oscillatory electric ﬁeld could be due to hopping
of the electrons along the CNT surfaces and the changing relative distances
between two CNT surfaces. In addition, the electrostatic force and the van der
Waals force are also important. The net force components acting on the CNTs
parallel to the Z and the X directions are calculated as [7]
fz =

(flz + fvsz )ds + fcz + fpz ,

(6)

fx =

(flx + fvsx )ds + fcx + fpx .

(7)

where fl , fvs , fc and fp are Lorentz, van der Waals, Coulomb and ponderomotive
forces, respectively, and ds is the length of a small segment of CNTs.
Under the assumption of small strain and small curvature, the longitudinal
strain εzz (including thermal strain) and stress σzz can be written as, respectively,

the eﬀective coeﬃcient of thermal expansion (longitudinal). Next, by introducing the strain energy density, the kinetic energy density and the work density,
and applying the Hamilton principle, we obtain the governing equations in (ux ,
uz ) for each CNT, which can be expressed as

assume ﬁxed boundary conditions (u = 0) at the substrate-CNT interface (z = 0)
and forced boundary conditions at the CNT tip (z = h(t)).

Stefan-Boltzmann constant. First, the electric ﬁeld at the nodes are computed
and then all the governing equations are solved simultaneously at each time step
and the curved shape s(x + ux , z + uz ) of each of the CNTs is updated. The

Computational Scheme, Results and Discussions

A key characteristics is the device current, and in what follows we focus on the
systematic integration of all the models at the computational level to calculate
the device current. At a given time, the evolved concentration of carbon clusters
due to the process of degradation and CNT fragmentation is obtained from the
nucleation coupled model, which is modeled by assuming the degradation as a
reverse process of growth (the nucleation theory has been used for the growth
of CNTs [13]). This information is then used in a time-incremental manner to
describe the evolved state of the CNTs in the cells. At each time step, the net

electromechanical force is computed using the momentum balance equation and
equation for electron gas ﬂow. Subsequently, the orientation angle of each CNT
tip is obtained. Thereafter, we compute the electric ﬁeld at the tip of CNTs at
each time step. Finally, the current density and device current are calculated
by employing Eq. (1). The computational ﬂow chart for calculating the device
current is shown in Fig. 2.
The CNT ﬁlm considered in this study consists of randomly oriented MWNTs.
The ﬁlm was grown on a stainless steel substrate. The ﬁlm surface area (projected
on anode) is 49.93 mm2 and the average height of the ﬁlm (based on randomly
distributed CNTs) is 12 μm. Actual experiments were carried out in a pressure
controlled vacuum chamber and ﬁeld emission current histories were measured
under various DC bias voltages. Fig. 3 shows the occurence of current spikes at

a voltage of 500V, which indicates that few CNTs are emitting heavily and are
pulled up towards anode. More spikes are observed as bias voltage is increased
to 700V (see Fig. 4). In the simulation and analysis, the constants B and C in
Eq. (1) were taken as B = (1.4×10−6 )×exp((9.8929)×Φ−1/2 ) and C = 6.5×107 ,
respectively [14]. The initial height distribution h and the orientation angle θ
were randomly distributed. The electrode gap (d) was maintained at 34.7μm.
The orientation of CNTs was parametrized in terms of the upper bound of the
CNT tip deﬂection (denoted by h0 /m , m >> 1). Several computational runs
were performed and the output data were averaged out at each sampling time
step. Figures 5-6 show the simulated current histories at diﬀerent tip deﬂections
and at diﬀerent bias voltages. Following observations have been made from the

results: (i) at a constant bias voltage, as the initial state of deﬂection of the
CNTs increases (from h0 /25 to h0 /20), the average current reduces until the
initial state of deﬂection becomes large enough (h0 /15) that the electrodynamic
interaction among CNTs produces sudden pull in the deﬂected tips towards the
anode resulting in current spikes; (ii) the amplitude factor of current spikes at
higher bias is of the order of ∼ 103 . On the other hand, the trend indicates
current spikes with an amplitude factor of ∼ 102 for lower bias voltage. Figure 7
shows the tip current distribution at t = 100s for an array of 100 CNTs. After
calculating strain from Eq. (8), corresponding changes in the bandgap along the
CNT length were calculated using tight binding formulation for bandstructure as
a function of strain [15]. The value of Young’s modulus used for the calculation
was 0.27 TPa. The strained energy bandgap along the length of CNT is shown in
Fig 8. The unstrained bandgap value was found to be 3.0452 eV. As evident from

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, a new multiphysics model has been proposed, which incorporates
nonlinearities and coupling related to electrodynamic, mechanical and thermodynamic phenomena during the process of ﬁeld emission. This model handles
several complexities at the device scale and helps in understanding the ﬂuctuation in the device current. Using the developed computational scheme, we were
able to capture the transients in the ﬁeld emission current, which have been

observed in actual experiments. This model can be useful in designing CNT thin
ﬁlm cathodes having a stable ﬁeld emission current and without compromising
their lifetime.
