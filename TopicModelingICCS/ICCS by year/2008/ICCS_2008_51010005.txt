Abstract. Over the past years, Service-Oriented Architectures have become a paradigm in enterprises for enabling more eﬃcient and ﬂexible
business processes and addressing some of the technological challenges
posed by the service-based economy. Using loosely coupled services, they
allow for discovery, composition and orchestration capabilities that are
needed by end-users, business processes or other services.

In parallel with these developments, research on Grid Technologies has expanded
from its initial focus on complex eScience applications towards general-purpose
service infrastructures that can also be used by business and industry. This requires the dynamic provision of resources in an easy and transparent manner
thus greatly facilitating the translation ofbusiness or user requirements into infrastructure capabilities. The business aim is on the convergence with the service
paradigm so that the infrastructure can be managed according to more ﬂexible
and dynamic business practices. This has opened new avenues of research in
Software and Services that complement the research that is being done on Grids
for scientiﬁc computations and on the deployment of research infrastructures for
eScience.
In this talk I will present the research on Software and Services within the FP6
and FP7 programmes of the European Commission, with particular emphasis
on the activities related to service oriented infrastructures and Grids. I will also
provide an overview of the expected research priorities in the coming years.
