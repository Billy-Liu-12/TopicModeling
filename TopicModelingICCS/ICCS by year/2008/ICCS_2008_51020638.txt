Abstract. Spherical Harmonic Transforms (SHTs) which are essentially Fourier
transforms on the sphere are critical in global geopotential and related applications. Among the best known strategies for discrete SHTs are Chebychev quadratures and least squares. The numerical evaluation of the Legendre functions
are especially challenging for very high degrees and orders which are required
for advanced geocomputations. The computational aspects of SHTs and their
inverses using both quadrature and least-squares estimation methods are discussed with special emphasis on numerical preconditioning that guarantees reliable results for degrees and orders up to 3800 in REAL*8 or double precision
arithmetic. These numerical results of spherical harmonic synthesis and analysis
using simulated spectral coefficients are new and especially important for a
number of geodetic, geophysical and related applications with ground resolutions approaching 5 km.

1 Introduction
On the spherical Earth as on the celestial sphere, array computations can be done for
regional and global domains using planar and spherical formulations. Spherical quadratures and least-squares estimation are used to convert continuous integral formulations into summations over data lattices. Spherical topologies are quite different from
planar ones and these have important implications in the computational aspects of
array data processing.
Spherical geocomputations for regional domains of even continental extents can be
reduced to planar computations and under assumptions of stationarity or shift invariance, discrete array computations can be optimized using Fast Fourier Transforms
(FFTs). Specifically, convolution operations for filtering and other data processing
applications thereby require only O(NlogN) instead of O(N2) operations for N data in
one dimension, O(N2logN) instead of O(N4) operations for NxN data in two dimensions, and so on.
For global appplications, Gaussian, equiangular and other similar regular grids can
be used for spherical quadratures and discrete convolutions. Various quadrature
strategies are available in the literature going back to Gauss and Neumann, in addition
to least-squares estimation techniques (e.g. [8, 16]). Other approaches have also been

used for discretization and analysis of functions on the sphere using triangular and
curvilinear tesselations based on inscribed regular polytopes (see e.g. [2]). Depending
on the applications, these strategies may be preferable to the equiangular ones which
will be discussed in the following.
The associated Legendre functions for high degrees and orders are computationally
very challenging. Without any normalization, one can hardly compute SHTs of degrees and orders over 50 or so in REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic. With proper
normalization such as the geodetic one used in the following computations, one can
achieve degrees and orders to around 1800 in REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic
[4] and over 3600 in REAL*16 or quadruple precision arithmetic [5,6]. With latitudebased preconditioning, [13,14,19] achieved about 2700. With Clenshaw’s approach,
similar results can be achieved for appropriately decreasing spectral coefficients such
as with the EGM06 model coefficients of degree and order 2190 [7,13].
The following shows that with proper numerical preconditioning independent of
the latitude, the Legendre functions can be evaluated reliably for degrees and orders
over 3800 in REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic. This is demonstrated explicitly
in synthesis and analysis computations using unit spectral coefficients with equiangular grids that do not include the poles. In order words, the previously published results [5,6] using Chebychev quadrature and least squares can be extended to degrees
and orders over 3800 working in REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic. This is
very important for numerous applications in geocomputations for ground resolutions
of about 5 km.

2 Continuous and Discrete SHTs
The orthogonal or Fourier expansion of a function f(θ, λ) on the sphere S2 is given by
∞

f (θ, λ) = ∑

∑

n = 0 |m|≤ n

f n ,m Ynm (θ, λ)

(1)

using colatitude θ and longitude λ, where the basis functions Ynm (θ, λ ) are called the
spherical harmonics of degree n and order m. In particular, the Fourier or spherical
harmonic coefficients appearing in the preceding expansion are obtained as inner
products
f n ,m = ∫ f (θ, λ) Ynm (θ, λ) dσ

(2)

S2

with the overbar denoting the complex conjugate with dσ denoting the standard rotation invariant measure dσ = sin θ dθ dλ on S2. In most practical applications, the functions f(θ,λ) are band-limited in the sense that only a finite number of those coefficients
are nonzero, i.e. f n,m ≡ 0 for all degrees n > N and orders |m| < n. Hence, using the
regular equiangular grid θj = jπ/J and λk = k2π/K, j = 0, …, J-1, k = 0, …, K-1, with J
and K to be specified later on, spherical harmonic synthesis can be formulated as
N −1

f (θ j , λ k ) = ∑

∑

n = 0 |m|≤ n

f n,m Ynm (θ j , λ k )

(3)

and using some appropriate spherical quadrature, the corresponding spherical harmonic analysis can be formulated as
J −1 K −1

f n ,m = ∑

∑q

j= 0 k = 0

j

f (θ j , λ k ) Ynm (θ j , λ k )

(4)

for quadrature weights qj as discussed by various authors e.g. [9,16,3].
The usual geodetic spherical harmonic formulation is given as
∞

f (θ, λ) = ∑

n

∑ [c

n =0 m=0

nm

cos mλ + s nm sin mλ] Pnm (cos θ)

(5)

where
⎧cnm ⎫ 1
⎧cos mλ ⎫
f (θ, λ) ⎨
(6)
⎨ ⎬=
⎬ Pnm (cos θ) dσ
∫
⎩ sin mλ ⎭
⎩ s nm ⎭ 4π S2
with the geodetically normalized Legendre functions Pnm (cos θ) expressed in terms of

the usual spherical harmonics Ynm (θ, λ ) (see e.g. [11] and [3] for details). The tilde
“~” will be used to indicate geodetic normalization in the following.
Explicitly, using the geodetic formulation and convention, one has for synthesis,
N −1

f (θ, λ) = ∑

n

∑ [c

nm

cos mλ + s nm sin mλ] Pnm (cos θ)

and for analysis, using complex analysis,

where
u m (θ) + iv m (θ) =

1 2π
f (θ, λ) (cos mλ + i sin mλ) dλ
4π ∫0

(9)

which is simply the parallel-wise Fourier transform of the data.
Hence using data equispaced in longitude and the corresponding Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) and Inverse DFT (IDFT), one can write for each parallel,
DFT
IDFT
{f (θ, λ k )} ⎯⎯⎯
→ {u m (θ) + iv m (θ)} ⎯⎯⎯
→ {f ′(θ, λ k )}

(10)

and correspondingly, for each meridian, with some appropriate Chebychev Quadrature (CQ) or Least Squares (LS) to be described explicitly below,
CQ or LS
SYNTHESIS
{c nm + is nm } ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
→ {u m (θ) + iv m (θ)} ⎯⎯⎯⎯
→ {c′nm + is′nm }

(11)

in which the Synthesis is only partial, i.e. in the Fourier domain. Notice that in general for band limit N, N rows of equilatitude data are required with LS while 2N rows
of equispaced equilatitude data are required with the CQ, and at least 2N equispaced
data are required for DFT per parallel (see e.g. [5,6] for more discussion).

Furthermore, for data grids with Δθ = Δλ which are often required in practice, such as
{(qj, lk) | qj = jp/N, lk = kp/N; j = 0, 1, …, N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 2N-1}
for LS, or
{(qj, lk) | qj = jp/2N, lk = kp/2N; j = 0, 1, …, 2N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 4N-1}
for CQ, the poles can be excluded with a shift in latitude
{(qj, lk) | qj = (j+½)p/N, lk = kp/N; j = 0, 1, …, N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 2N-1}
and correspondingly,
{(qj, lk) | qj = (j+½)p/2N, lk = kp/2N; j = 0, 1, …, 2N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 4N-1}
which allow the use of hemispherical symmetries in the associated Legendre functions
Pnm(cos (π – θ)) = (-1)n+m Pnm(cos θ)
Notice that these data grids with Δθ = Δλ have Nx2N and 2Nx4N quantities and N2
spectral coefficients for band limit N. More details with simulated results can be
found in [5,6].

3 Numerical Preconditioning and Optimization
The numerical evaluation of the associated Legendre functions Pnm(cosθ) for colatitude θ, is very challenging for high degrees n and orders m. To see this, one only has
to evaluate the diagonal terms Pnn(cos 1º) for n = 1, 2, …, 100, …, using different
normalizations. Furthermore, there are several strategies with recursions in n and m
and these are far from being numerically equivalent (see e.g. [1,3,14]).
The geodetically normalized associated Legendre functions Pnm (cos θ) are computed as a lower triangular matrix with the rows corresponding to the degrees n and
the columns corresponding to the orders m. With the initialization for degrees and
the
orders 0 and 1, P00 (cos θ) = 1, P10 (cos θ) = 3 cos θ and P11 (cos θ) = 3 sin θ,
diagonal terms Pnn (cos θ) = (2n + 1) / 2n sin θ Pn −1,n −1 (cos θ) and the subdiagonal
terms Pn ,n −1 (cos θ) = 2n + 1 cos θ Pn −1,n −1 (cos θ) computed recursively. The remaining
terms for n ≥ 2 and n-2 ≥ m ≥ 0 are evaluated with a three-term formula
cos θ Pnm (cos θ) = α nm Pn −1,m (cos θ) + α n +1,m Pn +1,m (cos θ)
with α nm = (n − m)(n + m) / (2n − 1)(2n + 1) as detailed in [18], based on [10, 15].
With this approach, degrees and orders up to 1800 or so have been achieved quite
reliably with REAL*8 or double precision and over 3600 with REAL*16 or quadruple precision arithmetic [5, 6].
Using IEEE standards for floating point arithmetic on personal and similar computers, the EXPONENT limits for real, double and quadruple precisions are as follows:
Variable Type

-1021
-16381

Maximum EXPONENT

Hence to avoid underflow problems in computing Pnm (cos θ) , a simple strategy is
to bias the EXPONENT of the corresponding variable by a large number and remove
the bias once the computations are done. Specifically, using personal and similar
computers with REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic, a bias of 1000 was applied to
the EXPONENT of the variable in question and the resulting numerical computations
are very stable. More details are included in the next Section.
This strategy of biasing the EXPONENT is independent of the colatitude θ
which is very important in this context. The literature on computing very high degree
spherical harmonics contains numerous strategies such as using the Clenshaw summation approach [13], preconditioning the variable with 10280sinθ in SHTools [19],
modifying the recursion to avoid high powers of sinθ [14], and others. These modifications have been reported to achieve degrees around 2700-2800 in synthesis computations [13, 14] and in synthesis and analysis [19]. Notice that in synthesis only
computations, it is only necessary to avoid underflows and set the corresponding incremental contributions to zero while in synthesis and analysis computations, the numerical recovery of the input spectral coefficients is expected in addition to avoiding
possible underflows.

4 Numerical Experimentation
To test the numerical preconditioning procedure, consider the following
CQ or LS
SYNTHESIS
{c nm + is nm } ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
→ {u m (θ) + iv m (θ)} ⎯⎯⎯⎯
→ {c′nm + is′nm }

with the partial SYNTHESIS in the Fourier domain as
u m (θ) + iv m (θ) =

N −1

∑ (c

n=m

nm

+ is nm )Pnm (cos θ)

(12)

for 2N isolatitudes with Δθ = π/2N for CQ and N isolatitudes with Δθ = π/N for LS.
In longitude, 2N equispaced points with Δλ = π/2N for both CQ and LS in the following experimentation. A shift in latitude of the grids by half Δθ has been implemented
to exclude the poles.
The Chebychev quadrature is as follows
c′′nm + is′′nm =

2N −1

∑ q (u
j= 0

j

jm

+ iv jm )Pnm (cos θ j )

(13)

with ujm ≡ um(θj) and vjm ≡ vm(θj), and CQ weights
qj =

sin ( ( j + ½ )π /2N ) ∑
sin ( (2h + 1)( j + ½ )π /2N )
N
2h
+1
h =0

(14)

with q2N-j = qj for j = 0, 1, …, N-1 by hemispherical symmetry. These computations
are roughly O(N3) for degree N.
The least-squares formulation per degree m is as follows

Discrete Spherical Harmonic Transforms
N −1

∑P

n =m

nm

(cos θ j ) (c′′′nm + is′′′nm ) = u m (θ j ) + iv m (θ j )

643

(15)

with isolatitudes
θ j = ( j + ½ )π / N = (2 j + 1)π /2N

for

j = 0,1,..., N − 1 .

The least-squares computations for c′′′nm + is′′′nm per degree m are obviously very
demanding and roughly O(N4). The elements in the corresponding normal matrices
can be evaluated using the Christoffel-Darboux formula as shown in [18, Appendix
B] based on [12], but this has not yet been implemented in the code yet.
Starting with simulated unit spectral coefficients, the reconstructed coefficients are
compared with the input coefficients and Root-Mean-Square (RMS) values are computed for various degrees and orders using both CQ and LS. The key results, all obtained in REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic, are shown in Table 1 for degrees
and orders to 3800. The results for degrees and orders to 1800 or so agree exactly
with those REAL*8 or double precision results published in [5 and 6]. The second
column of Table 1 are the RMS results on a Notebook (NB) while the third column
are the RMS results on a desktop PC, both with AMD Athlon64 Dual-Core Processors. The RMS decreases to E-04 for 3900 with CQ but the situation is better using
LS with E-13 for 3900 and E-09 for 4000. The numerical stability exhibited in Table
1 for synthesis/ analysis for degrees over 3000 has not previously been seen anywhere
else in the literature.

5 Concluding Remarks
Considerable work has been done on solving the computational complexities, and
enhancing the speed of calculation of spherical harmonic transforms for different
equiangular grids. The numerical problems of evaluating the associated Legendre
functions for very high degrees and orders have been solved using numerical preconditioning in terms of the EXPONENT of the corresponding variable. Explicitly, using

644

simulated unit spectral coefficients for degrees and orders up to 3800, partial synthesis and analysis lead to RMS errors of orders 10-12-10-13. When starting with simulated
spherical harmonic coefficients corresponding to 1/degree2, the previously results can
be expected to improve by a couple of orders of magnitude, as experienced in previous experimental work [4, 5, 6]. The latter simulations would perhaps be more indicative of the expected numerical accuracies in practice.
As enormous quantities of data are involved the intended gravity field applications,
parallel and grid computations are imperative for these applications. Preliminary experimentation with parallel processing has already been done [17] and these REAL*8
or double precision results can readily be duplicated in parallel environments.
