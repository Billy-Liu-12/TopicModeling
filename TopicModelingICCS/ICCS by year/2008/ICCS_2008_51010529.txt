Abstract. Designing an efficient deadlock-free routing is a point of concern
for irregular topologies. In this paper, we take a step toward the goal by
developing three novel deadlock-free routing algorithms in the content of a
new family of algorithms called label-based routing algorithms for irregular
topologies. In addition, the newly proposed family covers three previously
reported routing algorithms [2, 3]. Moreover, by simulating and comparing
the newly and traditional proposed routing methods, it is shown that the
performance of this family highly depends on the network topology and
channel labeling process.
Keywords: Label-based routing algorithm, irregular network, network of
workstation, performance evaluation.

1 Introduction
In recent years, cluster-based irregular networks (INs) such as networks of
workstations (NOWs also irregular network-on-chips) have emerged as one of the
cost-effective alternatives for traditional regular parallel computers. In such systems,
an irregular high-speed network is often required in order to provide the wiring
flexibility needed in network and also design of scalable systems with incremental
expansion capability [4, 7].
Without a careful design for routing scheme of INs, deadlock may happen in these
networks [5, 6]. Since the topology of INs is not predefined, designing and applying
deadlock-free routing algorithms are usually done without any pre-assumption about
the network topology. Therefore, the major problem of these networks is the
complexity of designing a general deadlock-free routing algorithm.
The main purpose of this work, section 2, is to take a step in this direction by
initially developing some deadlock-free routing schemes in the body of new family of
routing algorithms, called label-based routing algorithms, for irregular topologies.
Moreover, evaluating the performance of label-based routings in irregular networks
under realistic conditions is another major concern. To this end, extensive simulation
experiments have been conducted in section 3. Section 4 concludes the paper and
outlines some directions for future works in this line of research.

2 Label-Based Routing Algorithms
In order for a routing algorithm to be deadlock-free, cyclic buffer dependencies
between messages and physical channels they allocate, must not occur. When the
approach of labeling is used for generating deadlock-free routing algorithms, first, the
given topology has to be prepared for implementing the label-based routing
algorithm. Let us briefly describe the way in which the topology is labeled and also
the method by which the related routing schemes are generated.
The main idea of label-based routing algorithms is to classify network channels by
assigning predefined labels, then grouping the labeled channels in the way that there
is no cyclic dependency between each group. These groups are referred to as zones in
[1]. Afterwards, the generated zones are ordered in a sequence such that when a
message passes through the needed channels in the zones (regarding the sequence of
the zones) the sequence guaranties the message to reach its destination.
2.1

Fundamental Concepts of Graph Labeling, Deadlock-Free Zones and
Routing Algorithms

The first step in generating a label-based routing algorithm is graph labeling. Since
we plan to make a comparison between the previously reported routing algorithms
and the newly proposed ones here, in this paper we use the reported graph labeling in
[1-3]. As the starting point, a spanning tree (based on BFS1 graph traversal) is formed
on the given irregular network as the base of labeling process. Nodes and channels are
labeled in two stages as follows.
First stage: Nodes are labeled in ascending order regarding to spanning tree
formation and according to their distances from the root of spanning tree. A channel
that faces toward the lower node label is called '1' and the channel that goes away
from the lower node label is called '0' (figure 1).
Second stage: Subsequently, the second stage of labeling is applied to the graph in
the case that an increasing number is assigned to each node in the order that nodes are
visited by pre-order tree traversal. Channels are labeled using the policy of first stage
(figure 1).
Therefore, each channel is assigned two different labels and it is possible to think
of a channel label as a compound label containing two distinct labels. It is obvious
that there may be at most four possible channel labels for a given irregular topology.

(11), (10 ), (01), (00 )
These channel labels are:
As a result, a single '0' transition (channel) from node A to B means that the
corresponding label of node A is lower than B, and a single '1' transition from node A
to B represents that the node A has higher corresponding label than B. Therefore,
when both labels are brought into account as a compound label, we have the
following outcomes:
11
A ( a0a1 ) ⎯⎯
→ B (b0b1 ) ⇒ ( a0 < b0 , a1 < b1 )
10
A ( a0a1 ) ⎯⎯
→ B (b0b1 ) ⇒ ( a0 < b0 , a1 > b1 )

→ B (b0b1 ) ⇒ ( a0 > b0 , a1 < b1 )

00
A ( a0a1 ) ⎯⎯
→ B (b0b1 ) ⇒ ( a0 > b0 , a1 > b1 )

where ( a0a1 ) and (b0b1 ) are node labels.
The second step in generating a label-based routing algorithm is to group the
channels such that there is no cyclic dependency between the channels of the same
group. Since there are several ways to group the channels, it is possible to generate
various deadlock-free groups (zones) and in turn, different deadlock-free routing
algorithms.

Fig. 1. Node and channel labeling

As mentioned in label-based routing [1] there is a predefined ordering to travel
between channel groups and a message cannot use channel labels belong to a
previously traversed group, while it can use channel labels of the same group
adaptively. Consequently there is no cyclic dependency between channels of different
groups. Therefore, it is sufficient to group channel labels with no cyclic dependency.
As indicated in figure 2, message 1 holds channel (A, B) labeled as (10), and it
requests the use of channel (C, D) labeled as (11) and message 2 holds (C, D) and
requests the use of (A, B). Let’s assume that these two channel labels {(10), (11)} are
in a same group. Now, we should consider the situation in which messages 1 and 2
just use channel labels of the mentioned group, {(10), (11)}. For message 1 we have,
10
11
A ( a0a1 ) ⎯⎯
→ B (b0b1 ) ⇒ ( a0 > b0 , a1 < b1 ) C ( c0c1 ) ⎯⎯
→ D ( d0 d1 ) ⇒ ( c0 > d0 , c1 < d1 )

a0 < b0 ... < c0 < d 0 ⇒ a0 < d 0

Therefore, if message 2 wants to make a request for (A, B) while holding (C, D), it
should cross other channels such as (00), (01) and it contradicts the mentioned group
ordering traversal [1]. Thus, it is possible to put (10), (11) in one group.

Fig. 2. Cyclic dependency between (A, B) and (C, D)

The following corollary defines a general rule for creating deadlock-free zones or
groups of channels without cyclic dependency.
Corollary: there is no cyclic dependency between the channels X and Y if and
x : y0 ) ⊕ ( x1 : y1 ) = 1
only if they satisfy condition ( 0
, where : is the bitwise XNOR
operator and ⊕ represents the bitwise OR operator. It should be noted that labels
X ( x 0x 1 )
Y y y
and ( 0 1 ) are channel labels not node labels and four possible channel
labels were introduced formerly. Possible deadlock-free zones are (11,10 ) , (11,01) ,

(10 ,00 ) , and (01,00 ) .

The third and last step in generating a label-based routing algorithm is to order
deadlock-free zones in a sequence that guaranties connectivity for the routing
algorithm.
Theorem: The path between any pair of nodes is guaranteed by selecting a sequence
of channel labels whose first (second) bit is ‘1’ followed by a sequence of channel
labels whose first (second) bit is ‘0’ [1].
Proof: When a message chooses a channel with a compound label which contains at
least one '1', it gets closer to the root node of the spanning tree. In the worst case
situation the respective message reaches the root node and it is obvious that from the
root node there is at least one path to each other nodes in the spanning tree (whole
network). Therefore, when the channel labels are ordered in a sequence of '1's
followed by '0's whether in terms of first or second bit of the channel label, there is at
least one path between each pair of source and destination.
Now considering the generated deadlock-free zones and possible sequences, the
following label-based routing algorithms can be defined:

3 Empirical Performance Evaluation
The main performance metric of INs is the average message latency (average amount
of time it takes a message to completely reach its destination). In a thorough analysis,
the mentioned performance metric of the label-based routings is analyzed under
different working conditions considering different irregular topologies and different
spanning trees. As you will see, some interesting points are derived from the results of
the analyses that were not reported or referred in the previous works on the
performance evaluation of routing algorithms in irregular networks.
Analysis of this kind can be conducted through results obtained from a real
implementation of the network. But a cost effective alternative is to use a simulation
of the system.
3.1 Simulator
To evaluate the functionality of irregular networks under different conditions, a
discrete-event simulator has been developed that mimics the behavior of described
label-based routing algorithms at flit level. Input data (irregular topology) to the
simulator is specified in the form of adjacency matrix. Also, the spanning tree
assigned to the network can be both determined by user or automatically by one of the
famous BFS or DFS2 (with a predetermined heuristic) algorithms.
3.2 The Effect of Network Topology
When comparing the performances of two or more routing algorithms, using the same
working conditions such as number of virtual channels, message lengths, and traffic
patterns, it is always expected that one (or more) of the compared routing algorithms
shows better performance than the others. Generally, by changing the conditions for
all routing algorithms the order of routing performances usually does not change. For
example, the performance of XY routing [7] (ignoring the simplicity of implementtation) in comparison with the west-first routing [7] under the same working
conditions is worse. By changing the topology on which the respective routing
algorithms applied from Mesh3×3 to Mesh5×5 , the performance of west-first routing
still remains better, since the latter routing algorithm always provides more adaptivity
than the former one. As a result, in most cases a fair comparison provides a definite
order of performances of the compared instances. As we will see in this section, this is
not true for label-based routing algorithms (compared instances). The performance of
the label-based routing algorithm highly depends on the topology to which the routing
is applied. Therefore, it is not possible to make a general sequence of the performance
of the six aforementioned label-based routing algorithms.
Another design parameter that has a strong influence on the performance of the
label-based routing algorithm is the degree of irregularity of the network topology;
that is, the performance of this family is involved in the variance of node degrees of
the topology.

In order to show the above characteristics in irregular networks, a comparative
performance evaluation is presented in the results of the figure 3 where the average
message latency is plotted against the traffic generation rate. The analyzed irregular
networks are as follows:
G1(16 ,48), G2(36,124), G3(64, 240), G4(64, 240), G5: Mesh8*8, and G6(100, 364).

Network topology is the first parameter that should be considered, while choosing
the best label-based routing algorithm. Let’s look at the simulation results obtained
from different network sizes and network topologies. As can be seen, the sequences of
routing performances are totally different from one topology to another. The
following list presents the sequences of the routing performances for different
topologies:
•
•
•

G1:
G2:
G3:

R6, R4, R3, R5, R2, R1
R1, R3, R6, R2, R4, R5
R2, R1, R6, R3, R4, R5

•
•
•

G4 :
G5 :
G6 :

R6, R3, R1, R2, R4, R5
R3, R4, R1, R2, R5, R6
R3, R6, R2, R1, R4, R5

To see how different the sequences of routing performances are, consider the
sequences in G3 and G4. Excluding R4 and R5, the sequence in G3 is the reverse of that
in G4 although these networks contain the same number of nodes and even channels.
The only difference between these two networks is the way of connecting nodes or
network topology. Another interesting example that exhibits the effect of network
topology on the performance of label-based routing is R1, which shows totally
inconsistent behavior in G1 and G2. R1 is the best routing algorithm in G2 while is the
worst one in G1. We have the same scenario for R6, in G4 and G5 (mesh8×8).
As a consequence, it is sagacious first to specify the network topology; then,
choose the routing which shows the best performance on the chosen topology.
Another interesting effect is the degree of irregularity (variance of node degrees) of
topology. It is evident from figure 3(e) (mesh8×8) that the message latencies and
generation rates for which saturations occur for the six routing algorithms are nearly
the same. The reason is that although the mesh topology is not completely regular (a
network is regular when all the nodes have the same degree), all of the internal nodes
have the same degree of four so that the variance of node degrees goes down. The
identical result can be seen for G1. As a result, when the regularity of the topology
decreases, or the variance of node degrees diminishes, the performance of the labelbased routing algorithms are closely the same (figures 3(a) and 3(e)). It should be
noted that when the network size decreases (like G1), the probability that the variance
of node degrees become smaller increases (but this may not be true in all cases).
3.3 The Effect of Spanning Tree Construction
In the previous section the effect of network topology (network size) on the
performance of the six label-based routing algorithms was discussed. According to
the numerous presented results, it was shown that the performance of this family of
routing algorithms highly depends on the network topology. Going further through
the structural details of the six label-based routing algorithms leads us to analyze the
effect of forming different spanning trees created in terms of different root nodes. The
structure of a label-based routing algorithm is determined by two parameters which
are number and order of zones (channel labels).

Among the six routing algorithms, only R1 can direct the message through the two
existing paths. As a result, if the sequence of channel labels in a routing algorithm,
like R1, results in more possible minimal paths, the average distance of the network
will decrease. Moreover, the sequence of channel labels in a path is determined by
graph labeling. Therefore, the performance of a label-based routing algorithm
depends on the way of graph labeling.

The Effect of Network Topology and Channel Labels

537

Labeling of a network is determined by the spanning tree and the spanning tree is
formed based on a root node. Thus, in an irregular topology, the number of different
ways that a graph can be labeled is equal to the number of different spanning trees can
be formed on the graph.
Thus the performance of a label-based routing algorithm depends on the channel
labels and all the topological parameters that have direct or indirect effect on the
channel labels.
Figure 4 shows the effect of spanning tree root on the average message latency in
G1-G6 using R1, R3, R4, and R6. It can be observed that changing the root of the
spanning tree, and in turn channel labels, initially causes a substantial difference in
the network latencies and the generation rates for which saturation occurs.

4 Conclusion
First, in addition to cover three previously reported routing algorithms for irregular
networks; we proposed three novel deadlock-free routing algorithms in family of
routing algorithms called label-based routing algorithms. Second, the work has
confronted the task of evaluating the performance of the mentioned family in irregular
networks under realistic conditions. Third, by analyzing the experimental results, we
revealed that the network topology, channel labels, and other topological parameters
related to channel labels have great influence on the performance of label-based
routing algorithms. Therefore, it is not possible to make a general sequence of the
performance of the six aforementioned label-based routing algorithms.
Regarding to previous work which exhibits the reaction of routing algorithms in
regular networks in case of analytical models [8], further research in this line may
consider developing such models for irregular networks. Moreover, investigating a
general routing methodology for irregular networks and proposing some heuristics to
compute the best spanning tree on the given topology can be considered for future
work.
