Abstract. The Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS),
paradigm entails the ability to dynamically incorporate data into an executing application simulation, and in reverse, the ability of applications
to dynamically steer measurement processes. The ability to augment
the traditional application modeling with such dynamic data inputs,
acquired in real time, online, or existing as archival data, creates the
possibility of entirely new capabilities through improved applications
modeling, improved instrumentation methods, and systems management
methods, enhancing the analysis and prediction capabilities of application simulations, improving the eﬃciency of simulations and the eﬀectiveness of measurement systems, including providing powerful methodology
of management of heterogeneous sensor networks. The dynamic integration of the computational and measurement aspects in DDDAS environments entail a uniﬁed of the computational and instrumentation
application platform. In this presentation we will discuss the ensuing
DDDAS computational model in the context of examples of novel capabilities enabled through its implementation in many application areas.
An overview of the state of the art will be presented. A discussion of
how to connect U.S. and European or Asian DDDAS-like projects will
be initiated for all present at the DDDAS workshop.
