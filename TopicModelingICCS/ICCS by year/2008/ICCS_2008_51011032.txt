Abstract. The main purpose of this paper is to describe techniques for
the numerical solution of a Sturm-Liouville equation (in its Schr¨
odinger
form) by employing a Magnus expansion. With a suitable method to
approximate the highly oscillatory integrals which appear in the Magnus
series, high order schemes can be constructed. A method of order ten is
presented. Even when the solution is highly-oscillatory, the scheme can
accurately integrate the problem using stepsizes typically much larger
than the solution “wavelength”. This makes the method well suited to
be applied in a shooting process to locate the eigenvalues of a boundary
value problem.

Introduction

In this paper we are concerned with the numerical approximation of problems
of the form
(1)
y (x) = [V (x) − E] y(x), a ≤ x ≤ b
This equation is the Sturm-Liouville equation in its Liouville normal form, also
called Schr¨
odinger form. Mathematically, Schr¨
odinger problems arise from the
standard separation of variables method applied to a linear partial diﬀerential
equation, and in connection with the inverse scattering transform for solving nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations. The Schr¨
odinger equation is also well known
as the fundamental equation in quantum physics or quantum chemistry but
arises for instance also in geophysical applications, and vibration and heat ﬂow
problems in mechanical engineering. Many Schr¨
odinger problems have explicit
solutions, and are therefore important in the analytic investigation of diﬀerent
physical models. However most (boundary value) problems cannot be solved analytically, and computationally eﬃcient approximation techniques are of great applicability. Although we focus in this paper on the basic Schr¨
odinger equation in
a ﬁnite domain and with a smooth potential V (x), our scheme can be extended to
a more general Sturm-Liouville problem −(p(x)y (x)) + q(x)y(x) = Ew(x)y(x).
The parameter E (also called the eigenvalue) in (1) is unknown, and is to be
found subject to some kind of boundary conditions in the endpoints a and b.

Magnus Method of Sturm-Liouville Problem

It is well known that as E grows, the solutions of (1) become increasingly
√ oscillatory. In fact, as E → +∞ the solution “wave length” approaches 2π/ E. This
highly oscillatory character of the solution is the reason why standard integrators encounter diﬃculties in eﬃciently estimating the higher eigenvalues: a naive
integrator will be forced to make increasingly smaller steps severely increasing
the running time.
By taking advantage of special methods, one can construct numerical algorithms having special advantages over these standard (naive) methods. Pruess
suggested to approximate the coeﬃcients of the problem by piecewise constant
approximations, solving the problem analytically on the piecewise constant intervals (see [15,16]). For such a coeﬃcient approximation method the step size is
not restricted by the oscillations in the solution but the scheme is only second order, unless Richardson extrapolation approximations are made. Two approaches
have been suggested to construct higher order schemes, both being natural extensions of the Pruess ideas. A ﬁrst approach is based on a technique from
mathematical physics: the perturbation approximation, leading to the so-called
Piecewise Perturbation Methods (PPM) (see [8,9,10,11]). In [2] it was shown
that the piecewise perturbation approach may be viewed as the application of
a modiﬁed Neumann series. The second approach consists in the application of
another integral series: the Magnus series.
During the last decade, numerical schemes based on the Magnus expansion
received a lot of attention due to their preservation of Lie group symmetries (see
[5],[14], and references cited therein). More generally, Magnus methods have
been applied in spectral theory, Hamiltonian systems, symplectic and unitary
integration, control theory, stochastic systems, and quantum chemistry; see [1]
for a list of applications. Moan [13] was the ﬁrst to consider a Magnus method in
the context of Sturm-Liouville problems. He applied a Magnus series integrator
directly to eq. (1) with a piecewise polynomial V (x). However poor approximations can then be expected for large eigenvalues. Later Degani and Schiﬀ [2,3]
and Iserles [4] showed that it is a better idea for oscillatory ordinary diﬀerential
equations to apply the Magnus series integrator not directly to the equation but
to the so-called modiﬁed equation. In [12] such a modiﬁed Magnus scheme of
order eight was constructed for the Schr¨odinger problem and applied in a shooting procedure to compute the eigenvalues of the boundary value problem. In
the current paper we present the construction of a modiﬁed Magnus method of
order ten. In order to reach tenth order, the Filon-based quadrature rule for the
oscillatory integrals appearing in the Magnus series, had to be extended to triple
integrals. Also this new modiﬁed Magnus integrator can be used in a shooting
process to eﬃciently compute eigenvalues.

The (Modiﬁed) Magnus Method

The diﬀerential equation (1) is converted into a system of ﬁrst-order ODE’s
y(x) = A(x, E)y(x), y(a) = y0 ,

and y = [y(x), y (x)]T . Suppose that we have already computed yi ≈ y(xi )
and that we wish to advance the numerical solution to xi+1 = xi + hi . We ﬁrst
compute a constant approximation V¯ of the potential function V (x)

Next we change the frame of reference by letting

We treat u as our new unknown which itself obeys the linear diﬀerential equation

δ = x − xi ∈ [0, hi ],

u(0) = yi

¯
B(δ, E) = e−δA A(xi + δ) − A¯ eδA .

The matrix B can be computed explicitly. With ξ(Z) and η0 (Z) deﬁned as
ξ(Z) =

cos(|Z|1/2 ) if Z ≤ 0 ,
cosh(Z 1/2 ) if Z > 0 ,

we can write B as

where ΔV (δ) = V¯ − V (xi + δ) and Zγ = Z(γ) = (V¯ − E)γ 2 . Note that the
PPM-formulation in e.g. [8,9] uses the same functions ξ(Z) and η0 (Z) .
We apply a Magnus method to the modiﬁed equation (7). The Magnus expansion is then (where the bracket denotes the matrix commutator)
σ(δ) = σ1 (δ) + σ2 (δ) + σ3 (δ) + σ4 (δ) + . . . ,

and u(δ) = eσ(δ) yi , δ ≥ 0. Thus, to compute yi+1 = ehA eσ(h) yi with h = hi ,
we need to approximate σ(h) by truncating the expansion (12) and replacing
¯
integrals by quadrature (see next section). The 2 × 2 matrix exponentials ehA

and eσ(h) can be written down explicitely. ehA is the matrix exponential of a

To write down an expression for eσ(h) , we note that σ(h) is always a two by two
matrix with zero trace. For such matrices the following is true:

(14)

Here a, b, c, ω are functions of x and E.

Integration of the Integrals

As shown in [4], the regular Magnus quadrature formulae ([7]) are useless in
the presence of high oscillation. For E
V¯ the matrix function B in (11) is
highly oscillatory and quadrature must be used that respects high oscillation.
Filon-type quadrature can be used to approximate highly oscillating integrals
to a suitable precision in a small number of function evaluations per step. As
in [12], we will apply Filon-type quadrature not-only in the oscillatory region
E > V¯ , but also in the nonoscillatory E < V (x) region (where it is just as good
as regular Gauss-Christoﬀel Magnus quadrature).
The univariate Filon-rule is discussed in [4] and has the nice property that
while regular quadrature is ineﬀective in the presence of high oscillation, Filon
quadrature delivers accuracy which actually improves with higher oscillation.
Here, we use this Filon-rule to approximate the univariate (modiﬁed) Magnus
h
integral 0 B(δ)dδ. In fact, this means that ΔV (δ) in (11) is replaced by the
ν
Lagrange polynomial LΔV (δ) = k=1 ΔV (ck h) k (δ) where k is the kth cardinal
polynomial of Lagrangian interpolation and c1 , c2 , . . . , cν are distinct quadrature

1036

nodes. The resulting integrals can then be solved analytically. An alternative way
to obtain the interpolating polynomial LΔV (δ) is by approximating V (x) by a
series over shifted Legendre polynomials:
ν−1

Vs hs Ps∗ (δ/h)

V (x) ≈

(15)

s=0

By the method of least squares the expressions for the coeﬃcients Vs are
obtained:
Vs =

h

(2s + 1)
hs+1

V (xi + δ)Ps∗ (δ/h)dδ, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(16)

ν−1
It can then be noted that V¯ = V0 and ΔV (δ) ≈ LΔV (δ) = − s=1 Vs hs Ps∗ (δ/h).
To compute the integrals (16) tenth-order Gauss-Legendre is used, requiring
ν = 5 function evaluations of V (Gauss-Lobatto is another option).
With

ξ = ξ(Z2h ),

η0 = η0 (Z2h ),

Z2h = 4Zh = 4(V¯ − E)h2

and Vˆs = hs+1 Vs , s = 1, . . . , 4, we obtain then the following

of order ten, we need to include more Magnus terms. First we consider the
approximation of σ2 . We extend the Filon idea to the computation of the double

The three integrals in (19) must be replaced by quadrature. We again replace ΔV

As shown in [12] the inclusion of this second Magnus term leads to an eighthorder algorithm. Next we consider the approximation of σ3 and σ4 in order to
have a tenth-order scheme. The same procedure is applied again: the function

1038

V. Ledoux, M. Van Daele, and G. Vanden Berghe

ΔV appearing in the expressions for σ3 and σ4 is replaced by a polynomial. By
symbolic computation it can be shown that it is suﬃcient here to replace ΔV (δ)
by a third-degree polynomial. Therefore we take ΔV (δ) ≈ 3s=1 Vs hs Ps∗ (δ/h),
where the coeﬃcients Vs are still the same as the ones before. Also only the terms
where the degree in h is smaller than 11 have to be considered: e.g. we do not
take into account the Vˆ33 -term. We used the symbolic software package Maple
to compute the expressions of the 2 by 2 matrix ς = σ3 + σ4 . As an illustration,
we show some terms of the diagonal elements:

The formulas in (17), (21) and (22) may be problematic for E close to V¯ due
to near-cancellation of like terms. Therefore alternative formulas are used for
small Zh values (see [12]). These alternative formulas are obtained by applying
a Taylor expansion. The alternative for expression (17) is then e.g.
1 h
ΔV (δ)δη0 (Z2δ )dδ ≈

The alternative formulae are used in the interval |Zh | < 0.15, in this case it is
found that it is suﬃcient to go up to Zh8 .

Shooting for Eigenvalues

As mentioned before, a shooting procedure can be used to locate the eigenvalues of the boundary value problem associated with (1). The modiﬁed Magnus
method presented here is well suited for the repeated solution of the initial value
problems which appear in the shooting procedure. These initial value problems
are solved for a ﬁxed potential V but for diﬀerent values of E. For our modiﬁed
Magnus integrator, a mesh can be constructed which only depends on V and
not on E (a procedure similar as in [12] can be used to construct the mesh).
This mesh has to be computed only once and is then used in all eigenvalue
computations. Moreover the value V¯ and the coeﬃcients Vs are computed and

Numerical Examples

As test potentials we take two well-known test problems from the literature [17].
The Coﬀey-Evans problem is a Schr¨odinger equation with
V (x) = −2β cos(2x) + β 2 sin2 (2x)

(24)

and y(−π/2) = y(π/2) = 0 as boundary conditions. Here we take β = 30. The
second problem is the Woods-Saxon problem deﬁned by
V (x) = −50

1−

5t
3(1+t)

1+t

(25)

with t = e(x−7)/0.6 over the interval [0, 15]. The eigenvalue spectrum of this
Woods-Saxon problem contains 14 eigenenergies E0 , ..., E13 . We take here an
equidistant mesh. Note however that an automatic stepsize selection algorithm
can be constructed as in [12]. We performed some eigenvalue computations at
diﬀerent step lengths. The absolute errors ΔEk = Ekexact − Ekcomput are collected
in Table 1. For the Coﬀey-Evans problem some lower eigenvalues come in very
close clusters and to distinguish between them the search algorithm must rely
on a highly accurate integrator. Our modiﬁed Magnus method deals very well
with these close eigenvalues. Also no systematic deterioration of the accuracy is

observed as k is increased. This tenth-order method gives of course more accurate
approximations than the eighth order method of [12]: this method gives e.g. for
the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Coﬀey-Evans problem an error of 1.0E-7 (n = 128)
and 4.0E-10 (n = 256).

Conclusion

In this paper we discussed a modiﬁed Magnus method of order ten for the integration of a Sturm-Liouville problem in the Schr¨
odinger form. Therefore the
modiﬁed Magnus method described earlier by Degani and Schiﬀ and Iserles had
to be extended to the non-oscillatory E < V region and a Filon-like quadrature
rule had to be deﬁned for the multivariate integrals appearing in the Magnus
series. The modiﬁed Magnus method can be applied in a shooting procedure
in order to compute the eigenvalues of a boundary value problem. Since an
E-independent mesh can be constructed, all function evaluations can be done
before the actual shooting process, which makes the method well suited to compute large batches of eigenvalues or just particularly large eigenvalues.
