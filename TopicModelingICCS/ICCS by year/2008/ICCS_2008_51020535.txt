Abstract. We study an dynamical model on complex networks. The model is
based on a multi agent modeling which is aimed for representing ‘Network Effect’ in a market of personal communication services. By series of numerical
simulations using various models of complex networks, we found two classes in
resulting dynamics which are dependent on underlying network structures as well
as parameter settings. We also apply the model on a real social network data, and
discuss the simulation results in relation with the network models.

1 Introduction
Study on complex networks has been attracting wide attention in physics, engineering
and other fields as a basic representation for the analysis and understanding of a variety of complex systems. In such systems, complex network structures are considered
to be responsible for characteristic dynamical phenomena that take place on the systems. Under this idea a number of examples of complex networks including physical,
technological, biological and social systems have been studied [1–3]. Many statistical
properties which are commonly seen in many instances in networks are revealed, and
theoretical models of complex networks which realize these properties have been proposed [4–7].
In our preceding study, we reported that even a simple spin-like model of dynamical process on complex networks is widely affected by underlying network structure,
and inherent characteristics of network structures that are not fully represented by the
statistical properties can be classified in relation with the dynamical process [8].
On the other hand, real world examples of dynamical processes are more complicated than such the simple physical modeling. For example, interaction and decision
making of human in a real world market are much more complicated with various constraint and uncertainty, which often lead to specific real world phenomena, such as ‘Network Effect’ that is often referred to in business and marketing science literature [9]. In
such processes of human interactions, it is not an obvious question that the structural
complexity of network structures of interaction patterns will be associated with and
accountable for the resulting phenomena, even with relatively complicated models of

dynamical process. In this paper, we investigate a relationship between a more complicated dynamical model and underlying network structures, by extending our previous
works [8, 9]. The dynamical model is based on a multi agent modeling for an artificial
market simulation. Through a number of numerical simulations using complex network
models and a structural data of a real social network, we study resulting dynamics on
the system and their classifications.

2 The Model: Dynamics of Network Effect
We consider a dynamical model inspired by so-called ‘Network Effect’, one of a market
characteristic that often occurs in a market where two or more products or services
are competing. Generally, the network effect, or network externalities, is defined as an
effect whereby the benefit of a product or a service increase with the number of users
who also use the same product or service [10]. This has been considered to lead to
emergence of market phenomena such as ‘winner-takes-all’. So far, a number of studies
have examined the network effect, mainly for the purpose of understanding market
dynamics and constructing an efficient market or effective market strategies [11–16].
Above all, Wendt and Westarp [14], and Weitzeled et al [16] reported that network
structures, or topologies, of interaction patterns of users have a strong influence on the
magnitude of the network effect.
In the present paper, a multi agent simulation model that represents a market of
a personal communication service (i.e. mobile phone or short messaging service) is
constructed. The basic concept of the modeling is as follows. Individual users are represented by agents. Each user agent has a contact list of friends with whom to communicate. Users pay a charge for the service, which is proportional to the amount of
communication they do. In the market, there are assumed to be two competing service providers. Users choose one of the providers so as to minimize their overall costs.
Consequently, the communication pattern of users can be represented by a network

structure. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of this model. Each circle denotes
a user. For example, the user of the provider S in the center of the figure has six friends
to communicate with, four of whom use the different provider D and the rest are using
the same provider S.
2.1 Model of User
We consider that users can select either S or D service provider. Users pay for the service
in proportion to the amount of communications. Here, we assume that the charge within
the same provider is cheaper than that to the different provider. We also assume that an
additional cost (typically an initial setup cost) is required if a user wants to switch to
the other provider.
We can formulate this model as follows. The overall cost c that user i pays in a unit
period is
c(xi , αS , αD , kiS , kiD , δ)
= min (αS kiS + αD kiD )xi , (αS kiD + αD kiS )xi + δ ,

(1)

where xi is the amount of communication per a friend in a unit period of user i, kiS and
kiD are the numbers of friends of user i who are using the same provider and the different
provider as user i, respectively, and αS and αD are the unit charges of communication
to users of the same provider and the different provider, respectively. We assume αS
and αD as constant values that satisfy αS < αD . Here, δ is the cost to switch providers,
which is also assumed to be a constant.
In this modeling, we assume the total amount of communication Xtotal that users
make in a unit period follows a normal distribution N (μ, σ 2 ) for each user. Therefore,
xi in Eqn. (1) can be rewritten as xi = Xtotal /ki , where ki = kiS + kiD is the number
of friends of user i. Note that because of this assumption, the amount of communication
is asymmetric; the amount of communication from user i to user j and from j to i is
different if the number of friends are different. Consequently, Eqn. (1) can be rewritten
as
c(kiS , kiD , Xtotal ) = min (αS kiS + αD kiD )Xtotal /(kiS + kiD ),
(αS kiD + αD kiS )Xtotal /(kiS + kiD ) + δ .

(2)

At each step t, a user is randomly selected and a choice is made as to whether the
user should switch providers in order to minimize the overall cost according as Eqn. 2.
In other words, user i will switch the provider if
(αS kiS + αD kiD )Xtotal /(kiS + kiD ) ≥ (αS kiD + αD kiS )Xtotal /(kiS + kiD ) + δ,
and pay the switch cost.

2.2 Model of Interaction Pattern by Complex Network Models
In the present modeling, communication pattern among users in the market is modeled
on a kind of social networks. It has been revealed by recent studies that social networks
in the real world have a unique characteristics in their structures [2,3]. Examples include
power-law degree distribution, short average path length, high clustering coefficients
and positive degree correlations. These characteristics are surely considered to give an
effect on dynamical processes on such social networks, which we assume are not be
reproduced using simple structural models, such as lattices or random graphs.
We assume to be able to realize the characteristics of real social networks on the
market dynamics by considering network models as an interaction patterns of the multi
agent modeling. In order to investigate into the effect, the main purpose of this paper is
to analyze the dynamics driven by the above mentioned dynamical model under various
structures of complex networks, and to find out suitable structural models for an analysis
on real world problems.
In the present paper, we use four complex network models: the WS model [4], the
BA model [5], the KE model [6] and the CNN model [7]. The WS model is a socalled ‘small-world’ model that is based on a random rewiring procedure of the edges
from a one-dimensional lattice. The remaining three models realize a power-law degree distribution. They are models of a mechanism of network growth, in which different types of growth algorithms produce different characteristics in other structural
properties. The characteristics of the models are briefly summarized in Table 1. See
related references for the details of the models. For comparison, we also test the relatively simple structures of the one-dimensional lattice and the Erd¨os-Reny´ı (ER) random graph.

3 Numerical Studies
3.1 Network Models
First, we perform numerical simulations using the network models described in the
previous section. The total amount of communication Xtotal is defined as a random
value that follows normal distribution N (μ, σ 2 ), where μ = X k and X k /3, k is

average degree, and X is a constant value. Xtotal = 0 if a probabilistic random variable
N (μ, σ 2 ) is less than zero. The number of agents (users) is set 3, 600. Initial conditions
are randomly given. At the initial state, the two competing providers have randomly
selected 50% share of the users. Here, all of the parameter of the two providers are
the same, which means neither providers is advantageous. However, we found that the
system reaches an equilibrium state as time progresses, that one provider becomes advantageous (becomes the ‘winner’) at around a particular share. Examples of temporal
evolutions of shares in typical realizations are shown in Fig. 2.
We focus on the winner’s share after the equilibrium is reached. Figs. 3 and 4 represent average shares of the winner as functions of switch cost δ, comparing on different average degrees and different amount of communications. The values are averaged
over last 50 steps after t = 450, and averaged over 50 simulations with different initial
conditions.
Here we can observe a number of characteristics. From Fig. 3, the resulting phenomena can be divided into two classes. One is ‘ordered’ dynamics, which is observed in
the ER random graph, the BA network and the WS network. In this class, the shares
of the winner well converge to particular values with little deviation. The convergence
values are increasing function of the switch cost δ. This class is also observed in the
CNN network with large k , however, the convergence values are rather small than the
rest three networks. The other is ‘fluctuated’ class, in which the shares of the winner
fluctuate with a large deviation. The average values of the share is constant, or gradually
decreasing, function of δ. In regular lattice, the dynamics belongs to this class and the
values are around 50%, which was the initial share. This is considered to be the inherent
characteristics of the model of interaction itself, without the effects of complex network
structure. In the KE network, the deviation is larger than the regular lattice so that the
average values are rather large.

From Fig. 4, the system tends to be ‘fluctuated’ if the amount of communication X
is small and δ is large. However, it strongly depends on network structures which class
will occur at particular X and δ.
3.2 Real Social Network
We then perform simulations using a real structure of an e-mail correspondence network at a Spanish university [17] 1 , which we assume reflects the characteristics of
an human communication pattern in the real world. The data contains 1,133 users and
5,451 friendships (edges) k = 9.62. The clustering coefficient is C = 0.254, which
is 10 times larger than a random graph of the same number of agents, and the average

Fig. 5 shows example of temporal evolution of shares in typical realizations with
different δ. We can confirm that the system reaches an equilibrium state with the real
data as well as in the networks models. Fig. 6 shows convergence values of the average

‘ordered’ and the ‘fluctuated’ classes as in the network models. With large X, the system is ‘ordered’; the convergence shares of the winner are increasing function of δ, with
little deviation. With smaller X, we can still observe the ‘ordered’ dynamics as long as
δ is small. With such values of X, the convergence shares of the winner are ordered and
increases as δ increases, then reach the maximum at particular value of δ ∗ . As δ further

4 Discussion and Conclusion
In the series of the numerical studies, we found two classes, ‘ordered’ and ‘fluctuated’,
on the dynamics driven by the proposed model. From the simulations, we can say that
the ‘ordered’ dynamics is likely to emerge in small δ, large k and large X. The classes
have a dependence on network structures as well. The ER, BA and WS network tend
to exhibit ‘ordered’ dynamics in most cases, while in the KE network and lattice there
is always ‘fluctuated’. The CNN network is intermediate of the two, which is also seen
in the real data of e-mail correspondence network. The values of convergence shares of
the ‘winner’ are also dependent on network structures. In practice, the winner’s share
can be interpreted as a magnitude of ‘Network Effect’; if stronger network effect works
on the market, then the winner can take a larger share consequently due to the network
effect. Therefore, we can analyze which network structure can enhance or decrease the
network effect, and which model of network is suitable for studying the real social
network, from the simulation results.
In summary, we investigated an influence of network structures on a process of market dynamics. The dynamical model is based on a multi agent modeling for artificial
market simulation, which intends of representing a dynamics of ‘Network Effect’. Series of numerical studies using the simulation model showed two classes of dynamics,
which are strongly dependent on network structures. The simulation with an empirical data shows the pattern like that of the CNN model, which implies the CNN model
reflects the characteristic of structures of the real interaction patterns of users. In conclusion, it is confirmed that the structure of interaction patterns surely gives strong effect
on the resulting dynamics on it. By using appropriate models of the real interaction
patterns of users, it becomes possible to analyze dynamics of market more precisely.
