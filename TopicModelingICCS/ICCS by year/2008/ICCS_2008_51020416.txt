Abstract. We present a nonlinear structural stock market model which is a
nonlinear deterministic process buffeted by dynamic noise. The market is
composed of two typical trader types, the rational fundamentalists believing that
the price of an asset is determined solely by its fundamental value and the
boundedly rational noise traders governed by greed and fear. The interaction
among heterogeneous investors determines the dynamics and the statistical
properties of the system. We find the model is able to generate time series that
exhibit dynamical and statistical properties closely resembling those of the
S&P500 index, such as volatility clustering, fat tails (leptokurtosis),
autocorrelation in square and absolute return, larger amplitude, crashes and
bubbles. We also investigate the nonlinear dependence structure in our data.
The results indicate that the GARCH-type model cannot completely account for
all nonlinearity in our simulated market, which is thus consistent with the
results from real markets. It seems that the nonlinear structural model is more
powerful to give a satisfied explanation to market behavior than the traditional
stochastic approach.

1 Introduction
Modern finance is based on the standard paradigm of efficient market and rational
expectations. The efficient market hypothesis postulates that the current price contains
all available information and past prices cannot help in predicting future prices.
Sources of risk and market fluctuations are exogenous. Therefore, in the absence of
external shocks, prices would converge to a steady-state path which is completely
determined by fundamentals and there are no opportunities for consistent speculative
profits. In real markets, however, traders have different information on traded assets
and process information differently, therefore the assumption of homogeneous ra* Corresponding author.

tional traders may not be appropriate. The efficient market hypothesis motivates the
use of random walk increments in financial time series modeling: if news about fundamentals is normally distributed, the returns on an asset will be normal as well.
However, the random walk assumption does not allow the replication of some stylized
facts of real financial markets, such as volatility clustering, fat tails (leptokurtosis),
autocorrelation in square and absolute return, larger amplitude, crashes and bubbles.
Recently, finance literature has been searching for structural models that can explain such observed patterns in financial data. A number of models were developed
which build on boundedly rational, non-identical agents [1-4]. Financial markets are
considered as systems of interacting agents which continually adapt to new information. Heterogeneity in expectations can lead to market instability and complicated
dynamics. As a result, prices and returns in such markets may deviate significantly
from fundamentals.
In these heterogeneous agent models, different groups of traders coexist, having
different beliefs or expectations about future prices of risky assets. Two typical trader
types can be distinguished. The first type is the rational fundamentalists, believing
that the price of an asset is determined solely by its fundamental value. The second
typical trader type is the noise traders, chartists, or even technical analysts, believing
that asset prices are not completely determined by fundamentals but that they may be
predicted by simple technical trading rules. The literature on behavioral finance (for
surveys see [5]) emphasizes the role of quasi-rational, overreacting, and other psychology factors including investor’s emotions.
This paper builds on the model of [6], which is a deterministic behavioral stock
market model with agents influenced by their emotions. In [6], the trading activity of
the agents is characterized by greed and fear. They optimistically believe in booming
markets, but panic if prices change too abruptly. Although the model is deterministic,
it replicates several aspects of actual stock market fluctuations quite well. This paper
is to extend this model in two ways. We introduce fundamentalists into the model to
analyze how the interaction of different types of investors determines the dynamics
and the statistical properties of the system. Further, an exogenous noise is added to
the law of motion in order to mimic real market because noise and uncertainty play an
important role in real financial markets.
This paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 presents our model with heterogeneous traders. The third section brings forward the simulation results and discusses
the behavior of nonlinear dynamics. The final section provides a brief summary and
some conclusions.

2 The Model
Let us consider a security with price Pt −1 (closed price) on the last trading period.
Assume that this security is in fixed supply, so that the price is only driven by excess
demand. Let us assume that the excess demand Dt is a function of the last price Pt −1
and the present fundamental value Pf ,t .A market maker takes a long position whenever the excess demand is negative and a short position whenever the excess demand

418

is positive so as to clear the market. The market maker adjusts the price in the direction of the excess demand with speed equal to λM . Accordingly, the log of the price at
the end of period t is given as

p t = p t −1 + λ M D t ( p t −1 , p f ,t )
where

(1)

p f denotes the log of the fundamental value. In order to introduce an exogenous

news arrival process as a benchmark for the analysis of the resulting price dynamics, we
make the assumption that p f follows a Wiener process, and hence,

p f ,t = p f ,t −1 + ε t

(2)

with ε t ~ N (0,σ ε2 ) .
This specification makes sure that neither fat tails, volatility clustering, nor any
kind of nonlinear dependence are brought about by the exogenous news arrival process. Hence, emergence of these characteristics in market prices would not be driven
by similar characteristics of the news but would rather have to be attributed to the
trading process itself. Agents’ interactions magnify and transform exogenous noise
into fat-tailed returns with clustered volatility.
The market is composed of two typical trader types. One type is the rational fundamentalists, believing that the price of an asset is determined solely by its fundamental value, and the other type is the boundedly rational traders whose behavior is influenced by their greed and fear. Let us assume that a fraction α of investors follows a
fundamentalist strategy and a fraction (1 − α ) for boundedly rational traders. Let

DtF and DtN be, respectively, the demands of fundamentalists and boundedly rational
traders. The excess demand for the security is thus given by

Dt = αDtF + (1 − α ) DtN

0 ≤α ≤1

(3)

Fundamentalists react to difference between price and fundamental value. The demand of fundamentalists in period t is

DtF = λtF ( p f ,t − pt −1 )

λtF > 0

(4)

where λtF is a parameter that measures the speed of reaction of fundamentalist traders; we will assume that λtF = λ F throughout the paper. This demand function implies
that the fundamentalists believe that the price tends to the fundamental value in the
long run and reacts to the percentage mispricing of the asset in a symmetric way with
respect to underpricing and overpricing.
Following [6], the actions of the boundedly rational traders in our model are governed by greed and fear. The agents greedily take long positions because they know
that the stock market increases in the long run. However, they also know the fact that
stock prices always fluctuate, and such behavior is risky. The larger the risk, the more
the agents reduce their investments. If prices change too strongly, they even panic and
go short. For simplicity, it is assume that greed and fear-based behavior only occurs

for two activity levels. As long as the market evolves stably, the agents are rather
calm. However, in turbulent times both greed and fear increase. The emotional regime
switching process may be formalized as follows:

DtN = λtN −

t

( pt −1 − pt −2 ) 2

where λtN is a parameter that measures the activity level of emotional reaction to market

volatility. If 1 ∑ pt −i − pt −i −1 ≤ 0.045 and pt −1 − pt −1 ≤ 0.05 , then λtN = 0.05 ; oth5 i =1
N
erwise, λt = 0.10 . In other words, the agents are rather calm if the average volatility in
the last 5 trading periods is below 4.5 percent and if the most recent absolute log price
change is below 5 percent. Otherwise the activity level increases from 0.05 to 0.10. Similar to the explanation in Ref. [20], the first term of (5) reflects the greedy autonomous
buying behavior of the agents whereas the second term of (5) captures the fear of the
agents. Note that in the turbulent regime, extreme log price changes can be as large as
± 10 percent. In the calm regime, extreme returns are restricted to ±5 percent.

3 Simulation Results and Statistical Properties
In this section, we analyze the statistical properties of the simulated time series, which
have been generated with 2000 observations in each stochastic simulation in order to
allow the system to get sufficiently close to the asymptotic dynamics and to have time
series as long as the daily time series of the S&P 500 index between 6 October 1999 and
14 September 2007. Fig.1 reports the time series plot of the S&P500 and the simulation
series generated by our model with parameters λM = 1 , λF = 1 , α = 0.5 , σ ε = 0.03 , and

initial value p0 = p f ,0 = 6.12 , [ p1 , p 2 , p3 , p 4 , p5 ] = [6.07,6.08,6.14,6.18,6.20] .
Table 1 reports the statistics of the daily returns on the S&P500 and the model–generated
time series. The Ljung-Box Q statistics for up to 30 lags for returns (Q(30)) and squared
returns (QS(30)) are also presented. The Q(30) statistic for testing the hypothesis that all
autocorrelations up to lag 30 are jointly equal to zero in the stock markets is greater than
the value of χ 2 distribution with 30 degrees of freedom at the 5% level, suggesting that
the null hypothesis of the independence of returns should be rejected. Thus, linear serial
dependencies seem to play a significant role in the dynamics of stock returns. The next
and the most important question for the study of the behavior of nonlinear dependencies in
stock returns, is: do these returns also exhibit nonlinear serial dependencies? The easiest
way to answer this question is by examining the autocorrelation behavior of squared daily
returns. The values of QS(30) (see Table 1) provide strong evidence of nonlinear dependence, indicating that the conditional distributions of the daily returns are changing through
time. This is a symptom of ARCH effects. The results from Fig.1 and Table 1 indicate that
the model displays statistical properties similar to those of the S&P500 index and can
replicate the stylized facts of real financial markets, such as volatility clustering,

excess kurtosis, autocorrelation in square return, crashes and bubbles. Furthermore,
all these interesting features in our model arise endogenously from the trading process
and interactions of our agents. With the assumptions of IID Normal innovations of the
fundamental value, none of these characteristics can be attributed to exogenous
influences.
The significant deviations from normality (larger Jar.Bra) and the significant QS(30)
statistic in Table 1 suggest that there is very strong evidence of nonlinear structure in
simulated return series. In order to detect the nonlinear dynamics deeply, we use the correlation dimension method and the BDS test.
The method of the correlation dimension introduced by Grassberger and Procaccia
[7] provides an important diagnostic procedure for distinguishing between deterministic chaos and stochasticity in a time series. If the correlation integral C ( ε , m ) measures the fraction of total number of pairs ( xi , xi +1 , ⋅⋅⋅, xi + m −1 ) , ( x j , x j +1 , ⋅⋅⋅, x j + m −1 ) ,
such that the distance between them is no more than

where

H(u) is Heaviside step function, H (u ) =1 if u ≥ 0 , 0 otherwise; n=the number of
observations, ε = distance, C (ε , m) = correlation integral for dimension m, X= the
time series.
It is necessary to notice that when the embedding dimension m increases, the dimension

d m is reached, such that d c* is the estimate of the true correlation:
dc* = lim dc (m)
m →∞

If

(8)

d m tends to a constant as m increases, then d m yields an estimate of the correla*

tion dimension of the attractor, namely d c .
In this case, the data are consistent with deterministic behaviour. If

d m increases

without bound as m increases, this suggests that the data are either stochastic or noisy
chaotic.

The limitation of correlation dimension procedure is that no formal hypothesis testing is possible. To deal with the problems of using the correlation dimension test,
Brock et al. [8] devised a new statistical test which is known as the BDS test. The
BDS tests the null hypothesis of whiteness (independent and identically distributed
observations) against an unspecified alternative using a nonparametric technique. The
BDS test is a powerful test for distinguishing random system from deterministic chaos
or from nonlinear stochastic systems. However, it does not distinguish between a
nonlinear deterministic system and a nonlinear stochastic system. Essentially, the
BDS test provides a direct (formal) statistical test for whiteness against general dependence, which includes nonwhite linear and nonwhite nonlinear dependence.
Therefore, the null hypothesis of i.i.d. may be rejected because of non-stationarity,
linear or nonlinear dependence or chaotic structure. The BDS statistic measures the
statistical significance of the correlation dimension calculations. Brock et al. demonstrated that

[Cm,n (ε ) − C1,n (ε ) m ] × n

(9)

is normally distributed with a mean of zero. The BDS statistic, W, that follows is
normally distributed and is given by

W = n [Cm,n (ε ) − C1,m (ε ) m ] / σ m,n (ε )

(10)

where Cm ,n (ε ) and C1, n (ε ) are given in (7) and σ m ,n (ε ) is an estimate of the standard deviation. W converges in distribution to N (0, 1).
The BDS statistic can be used to test the residuals of GARCH type models for independence. If the null model is indeed GARCH then the standardized residuals of the fitted
GARCH model should be independent. However, it was demonstrated by Hsieh [9] that
the distribution of the W statistic changes when applied on the residuals of ARCH and
GARCH-type filtered. Therefore, we have to use the simulated distribution of the
BDS statistic by bootstrap method (which can be easily handled with Eviews5.0) in
such cases.
Before proceeding any further, we should firstly test the stationarity of our modelgenerated data. The augmented Dickey-Fuller unit-root test (ADF) shows that one unit
root exists in the simulated price series ( pt ). The ADF value is -1.02, which is greater
than the critical value at 5%. However, the ADF value for returns series (the difference
of pt ) is -22.44, which is less than the critical value at 5%. The unit root test strongly
rejects a unit root for simulated returns series and we can conclude that the returns series is
stationary. Given stationarity in returns, none of non-IID behaviour of stock returns can
be attributed to non-stationarity.
The correlation dimension estimates for the simulated returns series as well as the
S&P500 index returns series are presented in Table 2. Clearly, our model has correlation dimension estimates similar to that of the S&P500. For the two series, the correlation dimension estimates are lower than the embedding dimensions; however, they
do not converge to a stable value. The results indicate the underlying process is nether
purely random or completely chaotic.

We now apply the BDS test to the simulated returns series. In order to eliminate linear
structure in our model, the returns data were firstly filtered by an Auto-regressive Moving
Average method whose lag length was determined by the Akaike information criterion.
Table 3 gives the results of BDS tests. They strongly reject the hypothesis that simulated stock returns are IID. The rejection of IID is consistent with the view that stock returns are generated by nonlinear stochastic systems, e.g. ARCH and GARCH-type models, or nonlinear deterministic process such as chaos or noisy chaotic model. ARCH-type
models have been widely used to describe conditional heteroskedasticity and are deemed
to closely resemble the typical behavior of stock market volatility. Our interesting question
is: Does the conditional heteroskedasticity captured by ARCH-type models account for all
the nonlinearity in our model which is a nonlinear deterministic process disturbed by dynamic noise?
To answer this question, we ran the BDS procedures on the standardized residuals of
the fitted GARCH model to test if GARCH captures all nonlinear dependence in stock
returns.
The best GARCH model is determined by AIC criterion. The model is:
Mean equation rt = 0.2279rt −2 + 0.3397ε t −1 + ε t

The parentheses contain the z-statistics of the estimated coefficients. The Q(10) and
QS(10) statistics of the standardized residuals are significantly smaller than the critical
value 18.31 at 5%, indicating the absent of linear autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.
The standardized residuals from GARCH model serve as the filtered data.
Table 4 shows that the BDS statistics on the standardized residuals are much smaller
than those of the ARMA filtered data. However, most BDS statistics are still outside the
5% critical range. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the GARCH model cannot
completely account for all nonlinearity in the simulated returns. This evidence is thus
consistent with the results reported by Hsieh [9] in which Hsieh found that the popular
GARCH-type models couldn’t capture all nonlinear dependence in 10 stock returns including the weekly S&P500 index and the daily S&P500 index. This suggests that the
nonlinear deterministic model disturbed by dynamic noise may be more powerful to
mimic and explain the observed fluctuations in real economic and financial time series
than the traditional nonlinear stochastic models.
Finally, it should be noted that we only display one simulation run here for different parameter values. Because of random element added to our model, one simulated

data may differ from each other. However, the nonlinear dynamical behavior and
statistical properties for the fixed parameter can be relatively stable. As revealed in
further simulations, our conclusions are quite robust (which may easily be checked).

4 Conclusion
In this paper we have outlined a nonlinear deterministic model disturbed by dynamic
noise. The dynamical system is able to generate some stylized facts present in real
markets: excess kurtosis, volatility clustering, and autocorrelation in square and absolute return, crashes and bubbles. The market is composed of two typical trader types,
the rational fundamentalists believing that the price of an asset is determined solely by
its fundamental value and the boundedly rational traders governed by greed and fear.
The interaction of different types of investors determines the dynamics and the statistical properties of the system.
It is worth emphasizing that, in our model, all these interesting qualitative features
arise endogenously from the trading process and the interactions of heterogeneous
agents. With the assumption of IID normal innovations of the fundamental value,
none of these characteristics can be attributed to exogenous impacts. Taking together
the complex behavior in real stock markets and the academic achievements (see [1-2],
[10]), it seems more robust than the traditional stochastic approach to model the observed data by a nonlinear structural model buffeted by dynamic noise.
