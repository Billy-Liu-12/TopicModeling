Introduction

Molecular recognition abilities, the constitution of active sites and the associated
conformational dynamics, all of which are guided by noncovalent interactions
in their respective three dimensional structures, are important aspects in understanding of the functioning of biological macromolecules [1]. The molecular
biology community has greatly beneﬁtted from the concomitant understanding
of their sequence-structure-function space in terms of the physicochemical properties of constituent amino acids in protein enzymes. Recent surge in the interest
in understanding of the functioning of ribozymes, the functional RNA molecules,
has highlighted the need for developing fresh understanding about these aspects.
RNA molecules, with a preponderance of negatively charged phosphate groups
and a choice of univalent and divalent counter ions, present a diﬀerent set of
physicochemical environments. They need to function with the help of only four
types of bases, apart from a few modiﬁed bases, instead of the twenty diﬀerent
amino acids. Though there exists abundant literature related to the understanding of molecular recognition and conformational dynamics of DNA molecules [2],
the scenario in RNA molecules is far more complex than in DNA.
In DNA molecules we predominantly deal with double stranded helices with
complementary Watson-Crick base pairs holding the two strands together. RNA
molecules, on the other hand, are single strands folded on to themselves. The
relative positioning of diﬀerent regions in an RNA strand is thus not necessarily
mediated by canonical Watson-Crick base pairs. More than 40% of base pairing interactions in RNA molecules are noncanonical [3]. The second important
diﬀerence in the RNA molecules is the presence of the 2 OH group in the ribose moiety. This gives rise to extra possibilities for interstrand interactions in
RNA as distinct from that in DNA. Each nucleobase has three distinct edges

the Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen and Sugar (W, H and S) edge. Leontis and Westhof have shown how, on the basis of the six possible edge interactions and with
two possible glycosidic bond orientations (cis and trans) for each, pairing between any two interacting bases can be classiﬁed into twelve geometric families
[3]. With sixteen possible pair combinations arising out of an alphabet of four
bases, this leads to a total of 168 distinct base pair types, only four out of which
are canonical [4],[5]. This does not include the variety that may arise out of
modiﬁcations, including protonation and tautomerism, of the interacting bases.
Also not included are the possibilities of multimodality within each geometric
family. Notably, this count considers for example A:G W:W cis and G:A W:W
cis as distinct types. This is not unreasonable since studies within evolutionarily related sequences have, in many cases, shown a lack of covariation and has
highlighted the distinct nature of such combinations. Several studies exist involving compilation and characterization of noncanonical base pairs in available
RNA structures [4],[6]. These not only highlight the variety in number and nature of hydrogen bonds involved in base - base interactions, but also underline
the need for evaluating associated interaction energies. Several groups are currently involved in ab-initio quantum chemical studies of interaction energies of
RNA molecules [5],[7,8,9],[12]. In our studies involving more than 45 representative base pairs, most of which are mediated by two or more good N-H...N/O
hydrogen bonds [7,8,9], we have argued in favor of the possibility that the variety in physicochemical properties of several of these base pairs may deﬁne their
respective unique roles in the context of structure and dynamics of functional
RNA moelcules [7],[9]. While choosing representative examples and while building models for computations, we have so far not considered hydrogen bonding
interactions involving sugar O2 -H group. In this paper, we describe our results
of ab-initio quantum chemical studies on some representative members of two
structurally and biochemically important families of RNA base pairs, the cis and
trans Hoogsteen:Sugar edge families, where the sugar O2 interactions have been
explicitly considered.

Computational Methods

Gaussian [10] suite of quantum chemical programs was used for all electronic
and structural calculations carried out in this work. The initial structures of
the base pairs were built on the basis of their respective crystal geometries.
The ribose sugar of the base interacting through its sugar edge was retained in
our computations. The 5 -OH group of the retained ribose was replaced by a
hydrogen atom during model building. The ribose sugar of the base interacting
through its Hoogsteen edge was not involved in base pairing interaction, and was
therefore, replaced by hydrogen atom. Such models have been used recently in
literature and are fully justiﬁed for studying base pairing interactions in RNA
[5],[12].
We carried out unconstrained geometry optimizations with all parameters
relaxed, at the DFT level. The Becke’s three parameter exchange [13] and

Noncanonical Base Pairing in RNA: Topological and NBO Analysis

381

Lee-Yang-Parr’s correlation functional [14] (known as B3LYP) was used with
the 6-31G** basis set for geometry optimizations. The B3LYP/6-31G** optimized base pair geometries are shown to agree very well with the geometries obtained from RIMP2/cc-pVTZ (resolution of identity MØller-Plesset second order
perturbation method/correlation consistent-polarization valence triple zeta basis
set) optimizations [15]. This level of theory is well established in the literature for
studying nucleic acid base pairing properties [5],[12]. Natural Bond Orbital [16]
(NBO) and Atoms in molecules [17] (AIM) analysis have been performed in order
to understand the nature of interbase binding and to characterize the hydrogen
bonding interactions in terms of spatial distribution of electron densities.

Results and Discussion

We carried out geometry optimizations for ten selected base pair geometries,
ﬁve of which belong to each of the cis and trans H:S base pair families. We have
obtained minimum energy structures, which correspond to at least local minima
on the intrinsic potential energy surfaces of these isolated molecular systems.
All these studied structures are intrinsically stable, and do not deviate much
from their respective crystal geometries. The main geometrical parameters for
these structures are summarized in Table 1. All optimized structures possess at
least two hydrogen bonds, and therefore, can be considered as stable base pairs.
In order to characterize the hydrogen bonding in these base pairs, AIM and
NBO analyses have been carried out. An analysis of results of our computations
on base pairs of H:S family revealed several features, which could be helpful in
getting insights into physicochemical basis of RNA structures, and developing a
correlation between structural aspects and functional characteristics.
The 2 -OH group of the ribose sugar seems to have an equal tendency of
behaving as a hydrogen bond donor as well as acceptor towards the base of the
other nucleotide as revealed by small hydrogen bonding distances and relatively
linear bond angles (Table 1). The additional hydrogen bonds formed by 2 -OH
group of the sugar of a base with its partner base seem to be strong enough to
provide intrinsic stability to these base pairs. Except A:U H:S cis and C:C H:S
cis geometries, all other base pairs are stabilized by at least one hydrogen bond
involving O2 interactions. In case of H:S cis base pairs, wherever O2 interaction
is involved, O2 always act as a donor atom. In case of base pairs of H:S trans
family, O2 acts as an acceptor atom in case of A:A ans A:C geoemtries, and as a
donor atom in case of A:G, C:C and C:A base pairs. Thus the dual ability of the
2 -OH group of the base interacting through it sugar edge, provides additional
stabilization to these base pairs.
Occasionally, a third hydrogen bond also contributes to the stabilization of
studied H:S cis and trans binding patterns. Two of the ﬁve studied nucleosidebase systems (called as base pairs for simplicity) of H:S trans family, viz. A:A
H:S trans and A:G H:S trans, possess three hydrogen bonds. But the nature
of hydrogen bonding is diﬀerent in all these three cases. In case of A:A H:S
cis, a strong hydrogen bond involving N-H...N and a weaker hydrogen bond
involving C-H...N interaction stabilizes the interbase contacts. An additional
hydrogen bond of N-H...O type, involving O2 interaction is also present. In case
of A:G, both the interbase hydrogen bonds involve N-H...N interactions. The
O2 provides additional stabilization by forming a hydrogen bond with N6-H of
adenine.
Due to very weak electron density of hydrogen electrons obtained using Xray crystallography, there is an ambiguity in assignment of position of hydrogen
atoms in crystal structures of macromolecules. As a result, the correct assignment
of donor-acceptor tendencies to particular atoms forming hydrogen bonds is an
exceedingly diﬃcult task, and is writ with many errors. The optimized geometries
of the base pairs can correctly describe the intermolecular interactions in such
well deﬁned intrinsically stable building blocks of RNA. For example, in case of

C:C H:S cis, C:A H:S cis, C:C H:S trans and A:G H:S trans geometries, the O2
is considered as an acceptor atom by Leontis et al. [4], on the basis of crystal
structure analysis. But the full optimization of the crystal geometry clearly shows
the oxygen atom behaving as a donor in these cases.
Some hydrogen bonds are not assigned in the crystal geometry of these base
pairs. But the optimized geometries unambiguously show the presence of these
hydrogen bonds. For example, O2 interaction is not considered in crystal geometries of A:C and C:U H:S cis base pairs. Similarly, the hydrogen bonding interaction of C5-H with O2 is not considered in case of C:C H:S cis geometries.
Similarly, the weak interaction of C1 -H with N7 is not considered in crystal
geometry of A:U H:S cis. In case of A:A H:S cis, the O2 -H...N7 interaction
can be considered as a hydrogen bond according to geometric criteria. But the
results obtained using NBO and AIM analysis do not support this assumption
(discussed later). Thus, the nature of this interaction remains ambiguous. Thus,
the accurate strength and interaction in such hydrogen bonded complexes can
be assigned only using optimized geometries.
Analysis of charge density (ρ(rc )) and the associated Laplacian of charge
density at the hydrogen bond critical points (HBCP) provides a good measure
of predicting the strengths of hydrogen bonds [18]. In general, the values of
charge density and the Laplacian of charge density lie between 0.002-0.34 and

384

0.016-0.13 a.u respectively. The values for these two parameters lie well within
these proposed limits in these studied complexes. The values suggest that CH...O and C-H...N bonds are much weaker than other hydrogen bonds involving
O and N as donor atoms. However, the values of ρ are very close to each other
in case of O-H...N, N-H...N and N-H...O hydrogen bonds. Hence the relative
strength of these bonds cannot be predicted with accuracy. The O2 -H...N7 interaction in case of A:A H:S cis geometry, although satisfying the geometrical
criterion for hydrogen bonding (Table 1) cannot be regarded as a proper hydrogen bond, due to comparatively much weaker electron density at HBCP as
compared to similar hydrogen bonds in other studied complexes. This is further
substantiated by the absence of interaction between nonbonding orbital of N7
and antibonding orbital of O2 -H bond in NBO analysis.

We had earlier shown a strong linear relationship between sum of electron densities at HBCP and the binding energy of base pairs. Using the same criterion, the
strength of binding between these base pairs can be estimated as: A:G H:S trans
> C:C H:S trans >A:A H:S trans > A:C H:S cis > C:A H:S trans > C:C H:S cis
> A:U H:S cis > A:C H:S cis > A:A H:S cis. The strength of binding could not be
predicted in case of C:U H:S trans geometry due to very high nonplanarity of this
systemand presence of two critical points between some atoms.

NBO analysis is carried out in order to understand the physical nature of
intermolecular contacts in these base pair complexes. The charge transfer interaction between nonbonding orbital of the acceptor and the antibonding σ ∗
orbital on thedonor-hydrogen bond (D-H bond) are of crucial importance in hydrogen bonded complexes. The occupancies of nonbonding orbitalsof acceptor
atoms (na ) and antibonding orbital of D-H bond (σ ∗ D-H) are listed in Table 2. The occupancies of σ ∗ (C-H), σ ∗ (N-H) and σ ∗ (O-H) bonds lie between
0.01435-0.02952, 0.00583-0.05031 and 0.01994-0.05501 e (e stands for one electronic charge) respectively, showing greatest charge transfer in hydrogen bonds
where O2 acts as a donor atom. Moreover, the charge transfer stabilization energy E(2) is also greatest in case of O2 -H...N bonds. These observations further
substantiate the importance of O2 interactions in the stabilization of these base
pairing interactions. As discussed earlier, no charge transfer interaction between
na and σ ∗ (D-H) orbitals is apparent from NBO analysis in case of O2 -H...N7
interaction in A:A H:S cis base pair. Thus, it cannot be regarded as a hydrogen
bond.

Conclusion

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst ab-initio studies on base pairs belonging to cis
and trans H:S families. In addition to characterization of hydrogen bonds, these
calculations reﬁne the crystallographic data and evaluate the intrinsic stabilities
of these base pairs. All the studied structures do not show any diﬀerence in edge
interaction and glycosidic bond orientation, as compared to their respective crystal geometries. Hence, they can be considered as well deﬁned intrinsically stable
building blocks of RNA. The calculations thus, unambiguously show that hydrogen bonding is the most important stabilizing interaction in these noncanonical
base pairs. In addition to assignment of correct donor-acceptor interacions, these
calculations also highlight the importance of interactions inviolving sugar O2
in RNA base pairing. Previous studies [4] on detection of base pairs in RNA
structures considered the oxygen atom of the sugar hydroxyl group as hydrogen
bond acceptor only. We ﬁnd that in many cases, this hydroxyl group acts as
a hydrogen bond donor. Recently it was also indicated from statistical analysis that O-H...N is a very strong hydrogen bond [19]. This indicates the need
to revisit the problem of base pair ﬁnding by automated tools such as BPFind
[11] or X3DNA [20]. Further studies regarding evaluation of interaction energies
and complete quantum chemcial characterization and physicochemical impact
of change in edge orietnation on optimization in other members of these RNA
base pairing families are in progress.
