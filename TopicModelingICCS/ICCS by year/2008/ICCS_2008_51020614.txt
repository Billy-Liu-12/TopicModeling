Abstract. The present paper deals with the numerical simulation of thresholdcrossing problem allowing us to assess the probability that a random field of
contamination does not exceed a fixed level in a certain two-dimensional (2-D)
spatial domain. A real-valued, homogeneous random field described by the mean
value and the covariance (differentiable) function is assumed as the basic theoretical model of the contamination field. In the numerical simulation, a suitable discrete model defined on a regular or irregular grid has been developed and tested
by the conditional simulation method. The practical example concerns a case
study of heavy metals concentration in soil of the northern part of Poland. The results of the study indicate that theoretical modelling of the level crossings in 2-D
random fields with the continuous parameter shows a good agreement with the
numerical simulations of the fields with the discretised parameter.
Keywords: random fields, environmental contamination, numerical simulation,
threshold-crossing.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the theory of random fields has been intensively studied and applied
to a number of randomly occurring geographical and environmental processes [1-3].
In particular, numerical methods of modelling of random fields of contamination have
been shown to be very useful for the purposes of monitoring contamination level as
well as for predicting unknown contamination values (see, for example, [3-5]). The
present paper is dedicated to the development of a new approach to analyse and control 2-D fields of environmental contamination. It deals with the numerical method of
assessing the probability, that a random field of contamination does not exceed a
fixed level in a certain two-dimensional (2-D) spatial domain. The main concept of
this work is the mean number of upcrossings of the field level, calculated for some
intervals in one-dimensional subspaces of the 2-D domain. Theoretical model and
numerical simulations are treated jointly, which leads to a deeper understanding of the
random phenomena in terms of covariance functions, optimal sampling and probabilities of threshold crossings.

2 Model of Random Fields of Environmental Contamination
The study presented in this paper concerns the spatial behaviour of some natural geographical or environmental phenomena, e.g. contamination of soil. The approach is

based on the interpretation of the natural process by means of the spatial random field
models (see [1-3]). It is assumed that X (r ) represents a scalar, in general spacenonhomogeneous random field, where r ∈ R 2 denotes a two-dimensional position
vector. The so-called second order field is characterised in terms of its mean value
function:

m x ( r ) = E ( X (r ) )

(1)

and spatial covariance function:
K x ( r1 , r2 ) = E ( ( X (r1 ) − mx (r1 ) ) ⋅ ( X (r2 ) − mx (r2 ) ) ) ,

(2)

where E (⋅) denotes the expectation operator and r1 , r2 ∈ R 2 . The following three
concepts: homogeneity, ergodicity and isotropy serve as some useful hypotheses. The
second-order field X (r ) is called space-homogeneous if its mean and covariance
functions do not change under a shift of the vector arguments:
mx ( r ) = const ,

(3)

K x ( r1 , r2 ) = K x ( ρ ) ,

(4)

where ρ = r2 − r1 is the distance vector. The homogeneous field is ergodic if the statistical information is included in the single realisation available. A special case of a
homogeneous random field is an isotropic field. In this case, the covariance function
depends only on the length ρ of the distance vector:

K x (ρ ) = K x ( ρ ) ≡ K x ( ρ ) .

(5)

A very important for our analysis is the fact that for a homogeneous random
field, the behaviour of its covariance function in the neighbourhood of ρ = 0 may
be a determining factor in regard to differentiability (in the so-called mean square
sense) of the field. For example, the homogeneous 1-D field is differentiable (in the
mean square sense) if, and only if, its covariance function K x has the second derivative at ρ = 0 . Moreover, the covariance function of the first derivative of the
process equals:

Kx' ( ρ ) = −

K x ( ρ ) ≡ − K x'' ( ρ ) .

The following covariance function describes the differentiable, homogeneous, isotropic, 2-D random field (named as Shinozuka field - see [5]):

where σ x is a standard deviation of the field, α is a scale parameter describing the
degree of space correlation, α > 0 , and the indices x, y on the right hand side denote
the orthogonal axes. The process along the line x = 0 has the covariance function:
K x ( ρ y ) ≡ K x ( ρ ) = σ x2 ⋅ exp ( −αρ 2 ) .

(8)

and finally:
K x ' ( 0 ) = 2ασ x2 .

If the covariance function of the 2-D field is of the form:
K x ( ρ ) = σ x2 ⋅ exp ( −αρ x2 − βρ y2 ) ,

(11)

where: α ≠ β (α > 0, β > 0 ) , then the field is anisotropic but homogeneous and differentiable (in the mean square sense). An example of the non-differentiable (in the
mean square sense) although homogeneous and isotropic 2-D field is the so-called
white-noise field defined by the covariance function:
⎧σ 2 for ρ = 0
Kx ( ρ ) = ⎨ x
⎩ 0 for ρ ≠ 0

(12)

and the zero-mean value function.

3 Upcrossing Problem in 2-D Contamination Fields with
Continuous Arguments
First principles allow us to derive an upper bound on the probability Pu of upcrossing
some deterministic level

u (r)

in 1-D homogeneous random field

X (r ) ,

where: r ∈ R . Let N u ( S ) denotes the number of upcrossings in the space interval

[0, S ] . The probability is expressed as:

Pu ( X ( r ) ≥ u ( r ) for some r ∈ [ 0, S ]) = Pu ( upcrossing at r = 0 or N u ( S ) ≥ 1) =

Pu ( upcrossing at r = 0 ) + Pu ( N u ( S ) ≥ 1) − Pu ( upcrossing at r = 0 and N u ( S ) ≥ 1) .

(13)

It should be noticed that the last negative term of Equation (13) is smaller than the
smallest positive one. Therefore, from the theorem of the total event, the upper bound
on Pu is found:

Numerical Simulation of Threshold-Crossing Problem for Random Fields

617

Pu ( X ( r ) ≥ u ( r ) for some r ∈ [0, S ]) ≤ Pu ( X ( 0 ) ≥ u ( 0 ) ) + Pu ( N u ( S ) ≥ 1)

(14)

.
This upper bound is further developed as:
∞

Pu ( X ( 0 ) ≥ u ( 0 ) ) + Pu ( N u ( S ) ) ≤ Pu ( X ( 0 ) ≥ u ( 0 ) ) + ∑ Pu ( N u ( S ) = n ) ≤
n =1

∞

Pu ( X ( 0 ) ≥ u ( 0 ) ) + ∑ nPu ( N u ( S ) = n ) = Pu ( X ( 0 ) ≥ u ( 0 ) ) + E ( N u ( S ) ) .

(15)

n =1

The last approximation is proper if:
∞

Pu ( N u ( S ) = 1)  ∑ nPu ( N u ( S ) = n ) .

(16)

n=2

The above inequality is valid in practical situations with the high level u, when
clustering of crossings can be neglected. The classical theory of Rice (see [1]) gives
the mean value of N u ( S ) in terms of the covariance function K x of the underlying
process. If X ( r ) is a zero-mean, homogeneous, differentiable (in the mean square

sense) Gaussian process on [ 0, S ] then:
E ( Nu ( S )) =

S
2π

⎛
− K x'' ( 0 )
u2 ⎞
exp ⎜⎜ −
⎟⎟ .
K x (0)
⎝ 2 K x ( 0) ⎠

(17)

For example, in the case of covariance function (8), from Equation (9-10) one may
obtain:
E ( Nu ( S )) =

S
2π

⎛ u2 ⎞
2α exp ⎜ − 2 ⎟ .
⎝ 2σ x ⎠

(18)

It is useful to evaluate the numerical values of the two terms on the right-hand side
of basic formula (15). Let us consider a practical environmental random field of soil
contamination by a heavy metal (chromium) in the northern part of Poland – Gda sk
region (see also [5,8,9]). The measured chromium concentration values in the soil are
as follows: lower bound a = 11.3 ppm , upper bound b = 26.1 ppm , mean value
m = 18.7 ppm . The upper bound of the space interval and the scale parameter are
equal to: S = 92 km , α = 0.12 km-2 . The three constant u levels above the mean
value: u = m + 2σ x , u = m + 3σ x , u = m + 4σ x (σ x = 1.48 ppm ) for Gaussian 1-D
random field with covariance function (8) are taken into consideration. The probability values for different levels of u, obtained using Equation (15) and Equation (18),
are presented in Table 1. It can be clearly seen from Table 1 that the second term is
the dominating one in the probability upper bound.

The next model connected with the upcrossing level in 2-D fields deals with certain non-differentiable covariances. We make use of the so-called Slepian inequality
[10]. If X ( r ) and Y ( r ) are two zero-mean Gaussian fields such that for all

r1 , r2 ∈ C ⊂ R 2 , where C is a compact domain, and moreover if:
E ( X ( r1 ) X ( r2 ) ) ≥ E (Y ( r1 ) Y ( r2 ) )

(19)

and
E ( X 2 ( r ) ) = E (Y 2 ( r ) ) ,

(20)

P ⎛⎜ sup X ( r ) ≥ u ⎞⎟ ≤ P ⎛⎜ sup Y ( r ) ≥ u ⎞⎟ .
⎝ C
⎠
⎝ C
⎠

(21)

then for any level u:

where “sup” denotes a least upper bound. In the special 1-D case described by the
covariance of the white-noise field type (see Equation (12)), it follows from inequality
(21) that the probability of the upcrossing is greater than in the case of the covariance
(8), since the conditions (19-20) are fulfilled. The same conclusion is valid in the 2-D
case described by Equation (7) and Equation (12).

4 Model of Conditional Simulations of Discretised Random Fields
For the numerical simulation of the threshold-crossing problem we have to consider
the discrete parameter random field in the form of the multi-dimensional continuous
random variables. The variables are defined at every node of the regular or irregular
spatial grid. An important question that arises is: at what points in the parameter space
should we sample a random field? Starting from the informational-theoretic approach
Vanmarcke [1] concludes that the length of the optimal sampling interval Δr may be
expected to be proportional to the scale of the fluctuation θ and he proposes:

1
Δr = θ ,
2
where:

for a 1-D homogeneous, ergodic in the mean field. In the case of the squared exponential covariance function (8), one obtains:

(24)

Therefore, the length of the sampling interval should be equal to:
Δr =

(25)

As the first step of presented approach, an exploratory (experimental) data such as:
lower bounds, upper bounds, mean values, standard deviations, correlation coefficients are collected from the small number of places. From the assumed theoretical
form of the covariance function we select the best function in the mean-square sense.
As the example, let us consider once again the random field of soil contamination
by a heavy metal (chromium) in the northern part of Poland (Gdańsk region) with
properties specified above. Treating a generated value at a chosen point of the field as
the known one, let us numerically generate values of contamination at other locations
along one axis of the space interval [ 0, S ] . For α = 0.12 km-2 , using Equation (25),
the length of the optimal sampling interval is calculated as equal to: Δr  2.6 km
what means that the distance of S = 92 km should be divided into 35 intervals. For
the generation purposes, the method of the conditional random fields simulation with

the acceptance-rejection algorithm is used (see [5,8,9] for details). In the analysis, the
simplified cumulative simulation procedure (see [7]) is chosen. In this procedure, the
field value at every next location is generated independently based on all so far generated field values at previous locations. The example of numerical generations of contamination values at all 36 field points is presented in Fig. 1. In the graph, the lines
indicating the mean level ( 18.7 ppm ) and three different u levels above the mean:
u = m + 2σ x = 21.66 ppm , u = m + 3σ x = 23.14 ppm , u = m + 4σ x = 24.62 ppm are
also plotted. The probability of upcrossing of different u levels calculated based on
100 numerical realisations is shown in Table 2.

5 Conclusions
The method of numerical simulation of threshold-crossing problem for random fields
of environmental contamination has been considered in this paper. The method allows
us to assess the probability that a random field of contamination does not exceed a
fixed level in a certain two-dimensional (2-D) spatial domain. In the numerical simulation, a suitable discrete model defined on a regular or irregular grid has been developed and tested by the conditional simulation approach.
The results of the study indicate that theoretical modelling of the level crossings in
2-D random fields with the continuous parameter (see Table 1) shows a good agreement with the numerical simulations of the fields with the discretised parameter (see
Table 2). This fact allows us to consider the method described in this paper as the
useful practical tool in the theory of geographical and environmental random fields.
In the methods of random field simulation of various geographical or environmental
phenomena, theoretical model and stochastic simulations are often considered as the
two distinct problems. In the presented modelling approach, theoretical model and
numerical simulations are treated jointly, what leads to a deeper understanding of the
random phenomena in terms of covariance functions, optimal sampling and probabilities of threshold crossings.
