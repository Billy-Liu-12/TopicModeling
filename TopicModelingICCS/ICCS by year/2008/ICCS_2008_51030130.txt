Abstract. Comprehensive, accurate and detailed maps of transcription
factor binding sites (TFBS) help to unravel the transcriptional regulatory
relationship between genes and transcription factors. The recently developed sequencing-based genome-wide approach ChIP-PET (Chromatin
ImmunoPrecipitation coupled with Paired-End diTag analysis) permits
accurate and unbiased mapping of TF-DNA interactions. In this paper
we outline a methodical framework to analyze ChIP-PET sequence data
to identify most likely binding regions. Mathematical formulations were
derived to streamline and strengthen the analysis. We established a more
faithful noise distribution estimation that leads to the adaptive threshold
scheme. The algorithms were evaluated using three real-world datasets.
Using motif enrichment as indirect evidence and additional ChIP-qPCR
validations, the overall performance was consistently satisfactory.

Introduction

Transcription factors (TF) play a pivotal role in controlling gene expression, and
thus directing the cellular behavior and mechanisms. Part of the eﬀort to fully
decipher the intricate regulatory networks and pathway, a key intermediate goal
would be to identify the relevant Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS).
Such is also one of the goals set out for the human genome[1].
Chromatin Immuoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful approach to study in
vivo protein-DNA interactions. It consists of ﬁve major steps: (i) cross-link the
DNA binding proteins to the DNA in vivo, (ii) shear the chromatin ﬁbers using
sonication or otherwise, (iii) immunoprecipitate the chromatin fragments using
speciﬁc antibody against given protein targets, (iv) reverse the cross-linking of
protein-bound DNA, and (v) analyze the ChIP enriched DNA fragments. These
DNA fragments can then be characterized using high throughput approaches,
such as hybridization-based ChIP-chip analysis [2],[3],[4],[5] or direct DNA sequencing. ChIP sequencing can be performed by sequencing individually cloned
fragments [6],[7], concatenations of single tags derived from fragments (STAGE)
[8],[9],[10],[11] or concatenations of pair-end-ditags to infer the linear structure

of ChIP DNA fragments (ChIP-PET)[12],[13]. The sequencing approaches have
their advantages over the hybridization-based approaches by elucidating the exact nucleotide content of target DNA sequences.
In a ChIP-PET experiment, 5’ (18bp) and 3’ (18bp) signatures for each of
the ChIP enriched DNA fragments were extracted and joined to form the paired
end tag structure (PET) that were then concatenated for eﬃcient sequencing
analysis. The PET sequences were then mapped to the reference genome to
infer the full content of each of the ChIP DNA fragments. The protein-DNA
interaction regions enriched by ChIP procedure will have more DNA fragments
representing the target regions than the non-speciﬁc regions. Therefore, with
suﬃcient sequence sampling in the DNA pool of a ChIP experiment, multiple
DNA fragments originated from the target regions will be observed.
In previous analyses of ChIP-PET data [12],[13], Monte Carlo simulations
were employed to distinguish true signals from noise. This paper proposes mathematical formulations for performing the similar assessment as the Monte Carlo
simulation in an eﬃcient manner, and further generalizes the approach to resolve potential irregular noise arising from anomalous chromosomal copies and
conﬁguration.

Results and Discussion
PET Clusters as the Readout for TFBS

Presence of PET clusters is clearly an initial indication of genomic loci enriched
for TF-bound fragments. The more PETs that a cluster has, the more probable the TF binds to the region. We can set a minimum cut-oﬀ criterion, say

z, and classify clusters with at least z PETs (i.e. PETz+ clusters) to be the
highly probable clusters with TF binding. A Monte Carlo approach has been
successfully employed to determine this threshold [12].
More analytically, if we assume that the noisy PETs are randomly and uniformly distributed along the genome, then the distance, D, between any two
consecutive random PETs is expected to follow the exponential distribution
with rate λ = F
G , where F is the total number of PETs and G is the genome
length. The probability of two PETs overlapping (i.e. the distance between
them is less than or equal the (expected) PET length) by chance alone is
Pexp (X ≤ k; λ) where Pexp is the cumulative exponential distribution function whose rate is λ and k is the expected length of a PET. Two overlapping PETs can be found in a PET2 cluster and beyond. Thus, the probability Pexp (X ≤ k; λ) is the probability of a PET2+ cluster to happen simply by
chance. More generally, the probability of the occurrence of a PETn+ cluster by
random is:
PrPET (Y ≥ n; λ) ≈ (Pexp (X ≤ k; λ))

In place of the Monte Carlo simulations, one can readily compute the p-value of
random PETn+ clusters using the above equation to determine the appropriate
threshold for a given ChIP PET library. Additional empirical evidence for Eq.
(1) will be provided later in the text.
2.2

Counting on Maximum Support for Deﬁning Binding Regions

While number of PETs in a cluster is useful for assessing whether the cluster is
likely to be a true signal, clusters with seemingly good number of PETs can still
be generated by random noise. For a true binding region with many PETs, the
exact position of the actual protein-DNA site will be more reﬁned and appear
as a sharp peak in the cluster. However, it is not uncommon to ﬁnd big clusters
whose overlapping regions are not well concentrated. This is an indication that
they might have been formed simply by chance. Figure 2 shows a snapshot of
two clusters from real libraries, contrasting a typical good cluster (left) with well
deﬁned core, to a conﬁguration with scattered overlap region (right) which was
most likely formed by random PETs.
We call a cluster as a moPETn (maximum overlap PET n) cluster if all of its
sub-region is supported by at most n PETs. Similar to the previous deﬁnition,
moPETn+ clusters represent the set of moPETm clusters where m ≥ n. The left
cluster in Fig.2 is PET5/moPET5, while the right cluster is PET5/moPET2. To
some extent, PETn/moPETm (where m < n) clusters are doubtful. There are
96 of such clusters in the p53 library, while the Oct4 and ER libraries contain
4,929 and 910 such clusters.
The probability of a moPETn to be initiated by an arbitrary PET < s, l > can
be estimated by the probability of observing additional (n−1) PET starting sites

at most l-bp away from s. This probability follows that of Poisson distribution
for observing (n − 1) events whose rate is λ within the interval k (=expected
PET length). More formally, the probability of an arbitrary PET to initiate a
moPETn cluster:

PrmoPET (Y = n; λ) ≈ PPoisson (X = (n − 1); λk) =

e−λk (λk)(n−1)
(n − 1)!

(2)

Using PrmoPET (n) and given the acceptable p-value level, we can determine
the appropriate cut-oﬀ of moPETn for identifying true TF-binding regions. Comparison with simulation results is presented below.
2.3

Comparing Empirical Results and Analytical Formulations

To evaluate the correctness of our statistical formulations in Eqs. (1) and (2),
we compared the analytical estimations of PETn+ and moPETn clusters distributions to the empirical ones generated through a 100,000 runs of Monte
Carlo simulations (see Methods) with diﬀerent sets of parameter as listed in
Table 1. The collected statistics were used to construct empirical distributions
which were then compared with the proposed analytical framework. Figure 3(a)
and 3(b) contrasts the empirical probability of PETn+ and moPETn occurrence
(points) against the analytical estimations (dashed lines). The analytical curves
tracks the empirical values very well, reconﬁrming the validity of the analytical
distributions.
2.4

Adaptive Approach for Biased Genomes

The estimation of rate λ, i.e. the expected number of PETs per nucleotide,
plays a critical role in Eqs. (1) and (2). This rate signiﬁes the expected noise
level of the dataset. A single global rate λ reﬂects the assumption that the

noisy PETs are randomly uniformly distributed across the genome. Although
may be acceptable in general, libraries generated from aberrant genome require
more reﬁned estimation. Ampliﬁed genomic regions will have higher PET counts
than the overall genome, making their purely random clusters bear stronger
signal than those of normal regions. On the other hand, regions with significant deletions will contain less than expected PETs and their true binding
loci will be much weaker. Using single global λ would result in higher false
positive rates in ampliﬁed regions and higher false negative rates in deleted
regions.
We devised a two-phase adaptive approach that takes account of local biases
(see Fig.4) in predicting the most probable source (true binding vs. noise) of
each PET cluster. Given a cluster c, the ﬁrst phase considers the local window
of some predeﬁned size L centered on the cluster c, and, estimates the total
number of noise PETs. The second phase computes the local λ and calculates a
local moPET (or PET) cut-oﬀ TmoPET . Clusters c is considered to be binding
region if its moPET (or PET) count is greater than TmoPET .
The noise estimation step (phase 1) counts the number of potentially noisy
PETs within the window. Overestimation of noise would increase false negatives,
while underestimation would add false positives. We adhere to two heuristics: (i)
the current cluster should not be assumed as real and (ii) other clusters within
the windows that seem to be real clusters should, as much as possible, not be
counted as noise. The ﬁrst rule stems from the fact that most of the clusters
(especially PET1 clusters) are noise. Observations that binding sites are sometimes located proximal to each other motivated the second rule. For the window
size L, we set it to be at least twice the expected distance between two PETs
(i.e. λ−1 ). Noise estimation starts by identifying the probable noisy clusters. Assuming that the current cluster c is noisy, clusters within the window L with
higher moPET counts than the current cluster c are contextually considered
non-noise (line 3 in Fig.4). Next, the rate of noisy PETs per cluster is estimated by taking the geometric mean [14],[15] of PET counts of (locally) noisy

the noisy PET counts of all the clusters within the current window (line 5 in
Fig.4).
The second phase is quite straightforward through performing suﬃcient iterations of Monte Carlo simulations or the application of the Eqs. (1) or (2) using
the local rate λ (=S/L) and considering the window length L.
2.5

Performance on Real Datasets

Three real datasets were used in our evaluation: p53 ChIP-PET [12], Oct4 ChIPPET [13], and Estrogen Receptor (ER) ChIP-PET [16]. For each dataset, we
applied our proposed algorithms to predict TF-bound regions. The predicted
regions were then evaluated indirectly by enrichment of putative relevant binding
motifs and (whenever available) directly through further ChIP qPCR validation
assays (see Methods).
The p53 library was the ﬁrst and the smallest dataset (65,714 PETs, average
length: 625bp) and was constructed using the human HCT116 cancer cell lines.
The ER ChIP PET library comprised 136,152 PETs (average length: 72bp), was
assayed on human MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. The largest library among the
three, the Oct4 ChIP PET, was based on mouse E14 cell lines (366,639 PETs,
average length: 627bp). The non-gapped genome lengths for human and mouse
are estimated at 2.8Gbp (UCSC hg17) and 2.5Gbp (UCSC mm5).
Setting the cut-oﬀ of at p = 10−3 , the selected clusters for p53 is PET3+
or moPET3+, for ER is PET4+ or moPET3+, and for Oct4 is PET4+ or
moPET4+. Table 2 gives the validations of each PET cluster group in each library and PET or moPET cluster group. Sharp motif enrichment can be seen

136

at the selected cut-oﬀs in all libraries, compared to the PET2 or moPET2 group,
which is expected to be noisy. Table 2 also shows high success rate of ChIP-qPCR
validations. The p53 library had 100% of the ChIP-qPCR tested sites showing
enrichment of p53 binding. The high ChIP-qPCR success rate (> 95%) for the
selected Oct4 moPET4+ clusters also increased our conﬁdence of the validity of
the cluster selection approach.
Prior to running the ChIP-qPCR validation for the ER library, we noticed
unusual concentrations of PETs in regions, which correlated well with the regions
previously reported to be ampliﬁed in the underlying MCF-7 cell lines [17].
This prompted us to employ the adaptive moPET thresholding algorithm to
‘normalize’ the ampliﬁed regions. We also applied the adaptive approach on the
other two datasets, to see its eﬀect on other libraries from relatively normal cell
lines (i.e. the p53 and Oct4 libraries). The result is summarized in Table 3.
Adaptive thresholding might exclude clusters selected under the global thresholding and re-include clusters which would otherwise be excluded because they
were below the global threshold. Global and adaptive moPET thresholding produced the same results for p53 (see Table 3). Interestingly, application of adaptive
thresholding on the Oct4 library re-included some of the moPET3 clusters, with
a higher motif enrichment. Only a tiny fraction of the moPET4 was rejected,
with no signiﬁcant impact on motif enrichment. The ChIP qPCR success rates
for the adaptive-selected clusters were higher than before. A sizeable portion of
the moPET3+ in ER ChIP PET library was rejected and the selected clusters
had better motif enrichment, indicative of true binding. ChIP-qPCR assays on
random samples of the selected clusters conﬁrmed that further.

Methods
ChIP-PET Clustering

The primary ChIP-PET data is the locations and lengths of the ChIP-PET
fragments. The tuple < s, l > represents an l-bp long PET fragment mapped
into location s. Two PET fragments < s1 , l1 > and < s2 , l2 >, where s1 ≤ s2 ,
are said to be overlapping if s1 + l1 ≥ s2 . A ChIP-PET cluster is deﬁned as the
largest set of cascading overlapping PET fragments.
3.2

Simulation Procedures

To generate a random PET library, we preformed a Monte Carlo simulation
while taking into account the overall genome length (G), the total number of
PETs (M ), and the desired PETs’ lengths (minimum and maximum lengths).
In each Monte Carlo simulation, M points were randomly picked along the Gbp genome, mimicking the generation of a PET library containing completely
random fragments. For each picked point, a random length was sampled from a
uniform distribution within the given minimum and maximum bounds. Simulated PETs were clustered accordingly. Statistics of PETn+ and moPETn
clusters were collected and averaged over a suﬃcient number of Monte Carlo
iterations.

Evaluations of Selected Clusters from Real Datasets

The goodness of these clusters (i.e. whether these clusters were truly bound by
the TF) was then doubly-assessed: (i) indirectly from the enrichment of putative
relevant binding motifs among the selected clusters and (ii) directly through further ChIP qPCR validation assays. The putative motifs for p53 and Oct4 were
identiﬁed based on the binding site models described in their respective papers [12],[13]. Putative ER binding motif were based on the consensus sequence,
GGTCAnnnTGACC [18], and allowing for up to 2nt mismatches. Additional
ChIP qPCR validations have also been carried out on some of the selected clusters [12],[13],[16].

Conclusions

We have described a more principled framework for analyzing ChIP-PET data
to identify transcription factor binding regions. To dichotomize the PET clusters into potentially binding regions and likely non-binding regions, we utilized
a random PET generation model and estimated the improbable concentration
of PETs generated at random. The adaptive thresholding framework was introduced to handle aberrant genomes, e.g. due to ampliﬁcations and deletions
in cancer cell lines, or other experimental conditions. These analyses might be
further improved by taking into account other known inherent properties of the
genome (e.g. prevalence of repeats). We also noticed a potential utility of the
adaptive technique for identifying intrinsic features of the genome (e.g. for delineating ampliﬁed or deleted segments).
