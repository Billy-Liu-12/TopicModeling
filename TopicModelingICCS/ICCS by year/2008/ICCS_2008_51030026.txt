Abstract. Semiconductor manufacturing is a highly complex and asset
intensive process. Solutions are needed to automate control of equipment
and improve eﬃciency. We describe a symbiotic simulation control system which uses reactive what-if analysis to ﬁnd a stable conﬁguration of
a wet bench tool set. This control system is based on a generic framework
for symbiotic simulation. We show that symbiotic simulation can be used
to make control decisions in near real-time. Furthermore, we show that
our approach yields a notable performance improvement over common
practise.

Introduction

Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex process which turns pure silicon
wafers into integrated circuits with thousands of components. The whole process
may require up to several hundred processing steps and up to three months for
production [1]. One crucial factor for competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing is ongoing improvement of the manufacturing process [1]. Automation
is a critical factor in this context and the semiconductor industry invests several million US dollars for solutions. According to [2], investments for integrated
automation solutions can range between US$ 130 million and US$ 180 million.
These integrated solutions also include systems for real-time control of equipment. In addition to high complexity, the semiconductor manufacturing process
is also an asset intensive process. A variety of tools are used in semiconductor
manufacturing to process wafers and a single tool can cost up to US$ 2 million
[3]. Improvement of tool eﬃciency is therefore important in order to reduce cost
for additional tools.
Several performance metrics are considered in semiconductor manufacturing,
of which throughput, cycle time, and on-time delivery are considered the most
important ones [4]. The performance of most tools depends on their operation
mode, further referred to as conﬁguration, and the distribution of diﬀerent products, further referred to as product mix. If the product mix is changing, it might

be necessary to reconﬁgure various tools in order to maintain performance targets. Decisions regarding this are currently made by engineers who estimate
the required capacity for each product mix. Decisions are then implemented by
workers who manually change the conﬁguration of a tool. However, workers do
not always strictly follow their instructions. This, and the fact that decision
making relies mostly on the experience of engineers, causes the demand for an
automated control solution.
Simulations have already been used for oﬄine analysis and optimisation of
parameters in the manufacturing process. However, on-line solutions which use
simulation for real-time control are still in their infancy. Symbiotic simulation,
which is driven by sensor data and capable of making control decisions in realtime, seems to be a promising solution for automation and to improve equipment
eﬃciency. In this paper, we show how a dynamic data driven application can
be used for operational decision making regarding the conﬁguration of a wet
bench toolset (WBTS), which is used for one of the many critical operations
in semiconductor manufacturing. We describe a symbiotic simulation control
system (SSCS ) which is based on a generic framework for symbiotic simulation
being developed by us. The application of symbiotic simulation in semiconductor
manufacturing also represents the ﬁrst show-case for the generic framework. The
need for such a generic symbiotic framework has been articulated in [5].
The paper is structured as follows: Before presenting our own solution, we give
an overview of related work in Sect. 2. This is followed by an introduction to the
SSCS and a brief overview of the generic framework in Sect. 3. A more detailed
description of the WBTS is given in Sect. 4. We compare common practise with
our approach of controlling the WBTS. Therefore, we explain both approaches
in Sect. 5 before presenting our experimental results in Sect. 6. Our conclusions
are given in Sect. 7.

Related Work

The term symbiotic simulation was coined at the Dagstuhl Seminar on Grand
Challenges for Modeling and Simulation in 2002 [6]. Symbiotic simulation is
closely related to dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS). While
DDDAS emphasises the symbiotic relationship between an application and a
measurement process, symbiotic simulation rather focuses on the symbiotic relationship between a simulation and a physical system. However, symbiotic simulation is also dynamic data-driven and may use sensor steering to improve
the accuracy of simulations. Several applications which use symbiotic simulation
have been developed since 2002. These include the application of symbiotic simulation for UAV path planning [7], social sciences [8],[9], and business process
re-engineering [10]. In the context of semiconductor manufacturing, symbiotic
simulation has already been used in [11] to optimise backend operations.
Simulations have been used in several ways to improve the performance of
a semiconductor manufacturing process. Eﬀorts in this context mainly aim to
improve the cycle time. For example, in [3] a two day reduction of total cycle

28

H. Aydt et al.

time could be achieved by investigating a real wafer factory based on simulations. Other work which is concerned with improving cycle times can be found
in [12],[13],[14]. Wet bench tools have been the subject of various works. Lee
et al. [15] examine the scheduling problem of a wet station for wafer cleaning
using Petri net modelling and Gan et al. [16] evaluate the eﬀect of upgrading a
bottleneck furnace to the wet bench performance with increasing wafer demand.

Symbiotic Simulation Control System (SSCS)

An SSCS is a speciﬁc class of symbiotic simulation system. It makes decisions
based on the simulation and evaluation of what-if scenarios, each representing an
alternative decision, and implements them by means of actuators which are available to the system. A reactive what-if analysis aims to ﬁnd immediate solutions
to sudden, and potentially critical, conditions. For example, the performance of
a manufacturing system is observed and a reactive what-if analysis is carried out
once the performance drops below a predeﬁned value, i.e., once the performance
becomes critical. Various what-if scenarios, each representing alternative decision options (e.g., tool conﬁgurations), are simulated and analysed. The decision
option of the scenario which performs best in simulation is implemented.
The SSCS is realised using an implementation of our generic framework for
symbiotic simulation systems. This framework is based on Jadex1 , a BDI agent
system, and represents a library of functional components which are typically
required in a symbiotic simulation system. For example, creating and simulating
alternative what-if scenarios is an essential concept in symbiotic simulation. Each
of these functionalities, among several others, is realised as functional component
and provided by the framework.
We use capabilities [17],[18] to implement the various functional components
of the framework. The concept of capabilities is used in BDI agent systems to
facilitate modularisation of functionality. Agents can be equipped with an arbitrary number of capabilities. This allows ﬂexible design of application-speciﬁc
symbiotic simulation systems. For example, the design of inherently distributed
applications may involve several agents, of which each of them is equipped with
only one capability. On the other hand, it is possible to design a symbiotic simulation system which is represented by a single agent only. In this case, the
agent is equipped with all required capabilities. The use of capabilities also allows the design of tailor-made symbiotic simulation systems by using only those
capabilities which are required in the context of the application.
There are a number of distinct capabilities which are required to realise a
symbiotic simulation system. The following description of the SSCS includes
only those which are used in the context of the WBTS application. An overview
of the WBTS-SSCS capabilities is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The architecture of a symbiotic simulation system consists of three layers
for perception, processing, and actuation. The perception layer is responsible for
providing measured data to the processing layer where what-if analysis is carried

out. Once a decision is made, the actuation layer is responsible for implementing
it. Each layer is associated with a number of speciﬁc capabilities.
The workﬂow control capability WORC-C is the heart of the SSCS. It is
responsible for interpreting performance measurements provided by sensor capability S-C1 , triggering the what-if analysis process if the performance becomes
critical, and making control decisions regarding the conﬁguration of wet bench
tools. If a what-if analysis is triggered, the WORC-C requests a set of scenarios
from the scenario management capability SCEM-C, invokes simulations using
the simulation management capability SIMM-C, and interprets analysis results
provided by the simulation analysis capability SIMA-C. Based on these results,
the best decision option is determined by the WORC-C and implemented by
using the decision management capability DECM-C.
An SSCS can only implement decision options which are supported by actuators that are available to the SSCS. A decision model is used to reﬂect possible
control options, depending on the available actuators and their abilities to control
diﬀerent aspects of the physical system. In the context of the WBTS application,
the decision model reﬂects the possible operation modes for each wet bench tool.
The DECM-C keeps track of available actuators and updates the decision model
accordingly.
When requested by the WORC-C, the SCEM-C creates a number of scenarios
based on the decision model. Each scenario reﬂects a diﬀerent decision option,
i.e., a diﬀerent wet bench conﬁguration. A scenario also consists of an initial
state for the simulation run. This initial state is the current state of the physical
system, provided by S-C2 . The state of the system represents a snapshot of the
WBTS including all wafer lots which are currently being processed. In addition
to the decision option and the initial state, a scenario also consists of a given
product mix which is used to drive the simulation. The current product mix is
provided by S-C1 .
Sensors, actuators, and simulators are inherently application speciﬁc. Therefore, the framework cannot provide generic solutions for their corresponding

30

H. Aydt et al.

capabilities. Instead, application speciﬁc implementations have to be provided by
the application developer. The framework provides generic solutions for all other
capabilities. However, this does not rule out the possibility of using application
speciﬁc implementations instead of generic standard solutions.

Wet Bench Tool Set (WBTS)

In semiconductor manufacturing, a wet bench is used to clean wafers after certain
fabrication steps to yield higher wafer reliability [15],[19]. A wet bench tool
consists of a number of baths which contain chemical liquids and process wafer
lots according to recipes. Typically, a wafer fab operates a number of wet benches
with diﬀerent bath setups to support a variety of recipes. A recipe speciﬁes
constraints regarding the sequence and timing for the cleaning process. Each
lot is associated with a recipe and has to be processed strictly according to it.
Neither the sequence of chemical liquids in which a lot is processed, nor the time
each wafer spends in a particular chemical liquid must be changed. Violation of
these requirements would lead to signiﬁcantly reduced yield.
Particles of contaminants are introduced into the baths during the cleaning
process. Therefore, the chemical liquids have to be changed after a certain time.
Some recipes introduce particles faster than others. We therefore distinguish
between ‘dirty’ and ‘clean’ recipes [16]. In order not to compromise the quality
of wafers associated with clean recipes, wafers associated with dirty recipes are
processed by separate wet benches. Thus, a wet bench operates either in ‘clean’
mode or ‘dirty’ mode. By operation mode we mean that a wet bench is dedicated
to either one of the two recipe types. Switching the operation mode from ‘clean’
to ‘dirty’ does not require any particular activity. However, switching from ‘dirty’
to ‘clean’ requires a complete change of liquids. This activity takes up to several
hours [16].

Control Approaches
Common Practise Approach

The common practise approach involves engineers who decide upon reconﬁguration of wet bench tools. Decision making depends mostly on experience and is
therefore diﬃcult to capture. With information from the semiconductor industry we developed the following heuristic: 1) If the number of pending wafer lots
exceeds 40, the critical recipe (the most frequent recipe) is determined. 2) In
the next step, the set of wet benches is identiﬁed which is capable of processing
the critical recipe but is not conﬁgured to do so yet. 3) One of the wet benches
is selected and reconﬁgured accordingly. This is due to the fact that engineers
tend to be careful and change only one wet bench at a time. 4) After changing
the operation mode, the system is allowed some time to settle. 5) If, after the
settling-in time, the situation did not improve the process is repeated.

Symbiotic Simulation Control in Semiconductor Manufacturing

31

We assume a settling-in time of one hour when the operation mode is switched
from ‘clean’ to ‘dirty’ and four hours otherwise. The latter takes account for a
three hour maintenance process where chemicals are changed.
5.2

SSCS Approach

Similar to the common practise approach, the WORC-C of the SSCS observes
the number of pending wafer lots. If this number exceeds 40, a reactive whatif analysis is triggered. Each what-if scenario reﬂects the current state of the
physical system with an alternative wet bench conﬁguration. In this particular
application, we use eight wet bench tools, of which each can operate either in
‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ mode. This results in a total of 256 diﬀerent possible scenarios,
created by the SCEM-C. The performance for the next 24 hours is simulated by
the SIMM-C for each scenario. The SIMA-C analyses the simulation results and
determines the average performance of each scenario in terms of throughput.
The best conﬁguration is determined by the WORC-C and implemented by the
DECM-C. To implement a decision, the DECM-C sends corresponding control
signals to the A-C, which is capable of changing the operation modes of wet
benches in the physical system. Once a decision is implemented, the SSCS is
inactive for a ﬁxed settling-in period of four hours.

Experiments

For practical reasons, experiments were not performed with a real physical system. Instead, we used a simulation of the WBTS to emulate the physical system.
The emulator was paced at a speed 3600 times faster than real-time. This enabled us to perform experiments, reﬂecting a period of several months, within
a few hours. We also used a mechanism to create snapshots of the emulator at
any time. Such a snapshot can then be used as initial state for the simulation of
a what-if scenario.
The simulation model is deterministic with the only exception being the lot
generating process. This process generates arrival events of wafer lots with a distribution according to a given product mix. The SSCS has to consider this when
performing a what-if analysis. Therefore, each what-if scenario is simulated using
ﬁve replications. A whole what-if analysis step, including scenario creation, simulation, analysis, and decision propagation, takes approximately 50-60 seconds
on a cluster with 60 processors.
Each experiment was repeated ten times and the mean values over all results
are presented here. All results show the performance of the WBTS in terms
of cycle time. The cycle time is determined by the ratio of the overall time a
wafer lot spent at the toolset to the processing time according to the associated
recipe. The overall time includes the time a wafer lot has to wait before being
processed.

Cycle Time

With the ﬁrst experiment, we aim to show how well both approaches can maintain performance with an alternating product mix. We use two product mixes
with a constant load of 900 lots per day. In this experiment, a period of 20
weeks is considered. Within this period, the product mix is changed every two
weeks. We choose the product mixes so that there exists no conﬁguration which
is stable for both. This means, a conﬁguration which is stable assuming one
of the product mixes, is unstable when assuming the other product mix. An
unstable conﬁguration results in a throughput which is below the load. As a
consequence, queues of pending lots will build up and an increasing cycle time
can be observed. To avoid this, the wet bench conﬁguration has to be changed
eventually. Figure 2 illustrates the performance of the SSCS approach and the
common practise approach.

Fig. 2. Cycle time of the WBTS over a period of 20 weeks using the SSCS (left) and
the common practise approach (right)

In general, the SSCS approach produces a more homogeneous performance
with less variability and lower mean cycle time (SSSCS = 0.30, X SSCS = 1.89)
than the common practise approach (SCP = 0.76, X CP = 2.26). One major
disadvantage of the common practise approach is the fact that it is a trial and
error approach which changes only one tool conﬁguration at a time. Therefore,
it takes longer to ﬁnd a stable conﬁguration, if at all. On the contrary the SSCS
is capable of ﬁnding a stable solution, if there is one, and making all necessary
changes in one step. If no stable solution exists, the solution which performed
best in simulations is applied.
6.2

High Workload

At increasing load, it is necessary to oscillate between conﬁgurations. This is due
to the fact that only two of the eight wet benches used in this application have a
bath setup which allows them to process a large variety of recipes. All other wet
benches have setups which are limited to a smaller group of recipes. Therefore,
these two wet benches represent a bottleneck at high loads. To overcome this,
it is necessary to switch the conﬁgurations of these wet benches back and forth.

Symbiotic Simulation Control in Semiconductor Manufacturing

33

As a consequence, the performance is stabilised. However, above a certain load,
the performance cannot be stabilised anymore.
The second experiment aims to determine the critical load of both approaches.
The SSCS approach, which is more sophisticated, is capable of stabilising the
performance at higher loads than the common practise approach. Figure 3 and
4 illustrate the performance of both approaches over a period of one month with
loads of 1000/1200 and 1500/1700 lots per day, respectively.

Both approaches are capable of handling a load of 1000 lots per day. At a load
of 1200 lots per day, the performance becomes unstable when using the common
practise approach, i.e., the cycle time is constantly increasing. In contrast, the
SSCS is still capable of maintaining a stable mean cycle time.

The mean cycle time is elevated at a load of 1500 lots per day but the SSCS
approach is still able to handle it. However, at a load of 1700 lots per day the
performance ﬁnally becomes unstable.
The critical load for the common practise approach and the SSCS approach
is at approximately 1000-1200 and 1500-1700 lots per day, respectively. This
indicates that the SSCS allows the use of loads which are 25-70% higher as
compared to the common practise approach.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have described how a DDDAS, in particular symbiotic simulation, can be used for real-time control of semiconductor equipment and to
improve performance. Our experimental results show that using the SSCS yields
a notable performance improvement over common practise. This is important as
higher eﬃciency reduces demand for additional equipment. Decision making is
performed in reasonably short time. All this indicates the applicability of symbiotic simulation in the context of integrated automation solutions. In future
work, we will investigate how an SSCS can be applied to an entire semiconductor factory. This will also include investigation of diﬀerent forms of what-if
analysis.
