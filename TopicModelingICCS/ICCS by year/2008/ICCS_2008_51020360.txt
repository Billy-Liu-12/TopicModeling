Abstract. Binding of blockers to the Inﬂuenza A ion-channel is studied
using automated docking calculations. Our study suggests that studied cage compounds inhibit the M2 ion channel by binding to the His37
residue. The adamantane cage ﬁts into a pocket formed by Trp41 residue,
while the hydrogen bond is formed between hydrogen atom of ammonium
nitrogen and the nitrogen of histidine residue. This ﬁnding is supported
by experimental data and should help to obtain better understanding of
the inhibition mechanism of the Inﬂuenza A M2 ion channel.
Keywords: Inﬂuenza A, ion-channel inhibition, QSAR, antiviral drugs,
cage compounds.

Introduction

The inﬂuenza A virus, with 27 known subtypes that range from low to high
pathogenicity in the bird population, also infects humans and other mammals.
Subtype H5N1, currently known as avian or bird ﬂu, is of particular interest
because of its increasing pathogenicity and its ability to form a new viral subtype
to which there is no native immunity in human hosts.
The inﬂuenza virus is bound by a membrane taken from the plasma membrane
of an infected cell. The M2 protein is present in this membrane and forms protonselective channels that are essential to viral function. Based on experimental
data, it is assumed that the M2 proton channel consists of a tetrameric array
of parallel TM peptides with their N –termini directed towards the outside of
the virus and has following amino acids sequence: N –term–L26VVAAS31 IIGI
LHLILWIL43 –C –term. [1],[2],[3],[4] It is also believed that residues Val27, Ala30,
Ser31, Gly34, His37, Lys38, and Trp41 form the pore lining; and it is also possible
that histidine–37 plays an important role in the gating of the channel, or in the
mechanism of H+ transport or both.

Mechanism of Inﬂuenza A M2 Ion-Channel Inhibition

361

Adamantane derivatives have been used successfully for the prevention and
treatment of inﬂuenza A virus infection for more than 30 years. [5],[6],[7] It is
proposed that these drugs inhibit inﬂuenza A virus replication by blocking the
M2-protein ion channel. This prevents fusion of the viruses with the host-cell
membranes and the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm of infected cells. [8]
There is experimental evidence that the amantadine blockade of the M2 channel
occurs within the TM region. However, the mechanism of this process is still
unclear.
It was recently discovered that the Inﬂuenza A virus now exhibits resistance to
both, amantadine and rimantadine. [9] This resistance to adamantane derivatives
is believed to be due to a serine-31-to-asparagine mutation in the M2-protein.
[10] Also, it is possible that an amino acid substitution at positions 26, 27, 30
or 34 in the transmembrane region of the M2 protein is also responsible for
resistance to these drugs. [7],[11]
In such cases, treatment by amantadine and rimantadine will be less predictably eﬀective for treatment or prophylaxis in the event of a pandemic outbreak of inﬂuenza.
Obviously, better understanding the exact nature of M2 proton channel inhibition by amantadine and other possible drug candidates is needed. The present
study aims at shedding some light into this problem.

For modelling the transmembrane part of the M2 channel we used the PDB
entry 1NYJ with the following amino acid sequence order: SSDPLVVAASIIGILHLILWILDRL.
The blockers and the protein were prepared for docking using ADT, the
AutoDock tool graphical interface. [15] For each ligand Gasteiger charges were
assigned and atomic solvatation parameters were added. For the protein, polar
hydrogen charges of Kollman-type were assigned and the non-polar hydrogens
were merged with the carbons. The internal degrees of freedom and torsions were
set for each ligand.
The AutoDock3.0 software [16] was used to obtain unbiased binding positions,
estimate docking energies and inhibition constants for the studied compounds
1–16. The search was carried out with the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm: a
starting population of 150 ligand conformations with a stopping criteria of a
maximum 10 millions energy evaluations. Evaluation of the results was done by
sorting the diﬀerent complexes with respect to the predicted binding energy. A
cluster analysis based on RMSD values, with reference to the starting geometry,

was subsequently performed. All the ﬁgures in this paper were produced with
PyMOL. [17]
The results of the docking study shows that the TM part of the M2 channel can
be treated as three diﬀerent binding pockets within large pore. The ﬁrst binding
pocket (I) is deﬁned by Val27-Ala30-Ser31 residues of each α-helixes. It is believed
that amantadine resistance is determined by amino acid exchanges within this region. Also, in an early molecular modelling study [18] Sansom et al. suggested
localization of the amantadine binding site close to Ser31. In the formation of
the second binding pocket (II) participate mostly Gly34 and Ile35. Finally, His37
residue is responsible for the formation of the third binding pocket (III).
The computed docking energies of 1–16 within each binding pocket and computed respective inhibition constants (K i ) are summarized in Table 1. Both
cyclic amines 1 and 2 exhibit the lowest binding energies to all three binding
sites. Our study conﬁrms that cyclopentylamine 1 does not block the M2 channel
due to low binding energy and, thus, probable ability to pass through the pore,
which is in agreement with its lack of antiviral activity in infected cells. [19],[20]
While cyclohexylamine 2 is more bulky than cyclopentylamine 1, it still shows
low inhibition properties. This correlates with the sensitivity of inﬂuenza virus
replication to the size of aliphatic ring in the cyclic amines.
For all studied compounds His37 binding site (III) was found to be the most
preferred one. Rimantadine 6 has higher binding energies and exhibits ca. 10-fold
higher inhibition properties than amantadine 3. This can be explained by the
presence of the CH group between amino group and adamantane cage, which
allows rotation of the amino group and, therefore, assists closer and more favorable interaction with amino acid residues of the proton channel compared to
amantadine.

Consequent substitution of hydrogens in 3- and 5- positions in the adamantane
cage into methyl groups leading to compounds 4, 7, 10, 13 and 5, 8, 11, 14
increases binding energies and inhibition properties of 4, 5, 7–14 (Table 1).
Additional consequent introduction of methyl groups in adamantane cage of
compounds 9 and 12 leading to compounds 10, 13 and 11, 14 also increases
binding energies and inhibition properties as it was in case of amantadine and
rimantadine (Table 1). In fact, increase of molecular volume of the inhibitor
and presence of the acetyl group makes 14 the strongest blocker among studied
compounds.
It should be mentioned that the nitrogen atom of amino group of all four
ligands forms a hydrogen bond with the residues that form the binding pocket.
Figures 2–4 show a detailed view of the docked representative ligands 14 or 8
within the ﬁrst, second and third binding pockets, respectively. The distance
between the ammonium hydrogen and the oxygen atom of serine residue in the
ﬁrst binding pocket ranges from 2.37˚
A (in 2), 2.0˚
A (in 1 and 3) to 1.84 ˚
A (4).
In the second binding pocket there is also possibility to form hydrogen bonds
between the hydrogen atom of NH3 group and the oxygen atom of glycine.
Nevertheless, for all ligands studied here the most preferred binding pocket is
the third one. Interestingly enough, opposite to our ﬁndings, Sansom et al.[18]
showed that near the His37 residue there is a substantial barrier in case of amantadine and favorable interaction with cyclopentylamine. Our docking study shows
that the aliphatic rings and adamantane cage ﬁt into a pocket formed by
tryptophan-34 (Fig. 4), the hydrogen bond is formed between hydrogen of NH3

group and the nitrogen of histidine residue, leading to more eﬃcient blocking of the
channel. Moreover, the diﬀerence in the estimated inhibition constants of amantadine (3) and rimantadine (4) docked into the binding pocket III agrees fortuitously with the experimentally observed order. These ﬁndings are in agreement
with recently proposed model [21] in which the ammonium nitrogen of amantadine shares a hydrogen bond with an unprotonated histidine-37 imidazole while
the adamantyl group ﬁts in the lipophilic pocked formed in the vicinity of Gly34.
It is also worth to note that a similar adamantane-NH3 –His interaction has
been also recently found [22] for the Hepatitis C virus ion channel p7.

The structures in the inﬂuenza data set were aligned using SYBYL 7.0 program. Semi-empirical single-point calculations with the AM1 Hamiltonian were
performed on each using VAMP 9.0 [23] to calculate charges and orbital information. A three-dimensional grid with a point spacing of 2 ˚
A and a 4 ˚
A border
was generated used in the calculation of seven local properties: electron density
de , electron aﬃnity EAL , electronegativity cL , hardness hL , ionization potential
IEL , electrostatic potential V, and polarizability aL at each grid point using
Parasurf 07 program package [24].
Points interior to the molecular surface were removed from the grid by using a
generalized van der Waals radius of 1.16 ˚
A in order to ensure that property values

366

that bear no direct relation to surface activity would not appear in the PLS
analyses. This atomic radius, which is slightly smaller than the van der Waals
radius for the hydrogen atom (1.20 ˚
A), was chosen in order to leave enough
surface electron density to use the local electron density as a steric parameter in
the 3D-QSAR analysis. The local property values at the grid points were then
used as independent variables in separate partial least squares regressions, using
associated physical property values as target values.
The partial least squares analyses were performed using an in-house program
using the SIMPLS algorithm and a full cross-validation scheme, re-centering and
re-scaling the included data for each run. The PLS regressions were carried out
initially to ten vector components in order to determine the maximum number
of components to be included in the ﬁnal model, using the cross-validated standard error of prediction (SEP) of the model to choose the appropriate number
of components. In the cases where PLS analyses were performed using single
local properties, the property data was normalized by the mean. The regression
coeﬃcients for the ﬁnal model were then used to generate a three-dimensional
representation of the property space with colored spheres using Pymol.[17] Those
grid points with a positive relationship to the particular target property are
color-coded red, while those with a negative relationship to the target property
are color-coded blue. In addition to color-coding, the size of the grid spheres,
determined by the standardized magnitude of the regression coeﬃcients, represents the magnitude of the relationship between the local property at that point
to the target value.
The PLS analysis based on SYBYL CoMFA yelds with an r2 = 0.993 for 10
components, however, reducing number of components to 4 leads to:
r2 = 0.909; q2 = 0.348; σ = 3.46.
78.2% was found to be responsible for the steric inﬂuence and 21.8% - for the
electrostatic interaction.
QSAR performed with Parasurf07 (with 3 components) gives somewhat better correlation:
r2 = 0.913; q2 = 0.401; σ = 3.73.
The 3D-QSAR results for the two most contributed properties - electron density de and ionization potential IEL are shown below (Fig. 5, left and right,
respectively).
In this work, we have reported modeling of the M2-TM channel inhibition
by diﬀerent ligands. We have demonstrated the diﬀerence in binding mechanism
between small cyclic amines (1–2) and adamantane derivatives (3–16) in the
M2 proton channel.
The docking study shows that the M2 proton channel is blocked by cage compounds and suggests that the preferred binding site is in a vicinity of His37

residue. The calculated inhibiting ability of amantadine and rimantadine reproduces the relations observed clinically.
Based on our docking study with 3D-QSAR results we suggest that next
generation of potential M2 inhibitors should include lipophilic adamantane or
other hydrocarbon cage (i.e. trishomocubane) combined with polar groups (e.g.
hydroxyl, carboxyl, urea/thiourea moiety) separated from cage by methylene
bridges. Nevertheless, more clearer understanding of the nature of inhibition
mechanism is needed. One way of doing it - via molecular dynamic simulation
of the whole M2 ion-channel and its interaction with inhibitors. Results of such
study will be published elsewhere.
