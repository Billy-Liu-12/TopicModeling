Abstract. The paper presents a knowledge fusion architecture based on the grid
platform. The proposed framework suggests a semi-structural paradigm that
emphasizes connotation of distributed knowledge resources in a grid environment. Our approach involves an extractive process of meta-knowledge sets
which predigests the diversion among multi-source knowledge, the Genetic Fusion Algorithm which can generate a new knowledge space, a resources allocation method with meta-knowledge directory service. Experimental results of a
case study show the feasibility of design rationale underling knowledge grid.

1 Introduction
Knowledge fusion is an important component of the knowledge science and engineering, which can transform and integrate diversiform knowledge resources to generate new information [1]. So information and knowledge from distributed nodes can
be shared and cooperating. Multi-agent technology and grid computation method are
used to integrate specifically knowledge in a way, which require plenty of data conversion operations and mapping procedures [2][3][4]. The paper proposes the architecture based on meta-knowledge and ontology bases to replace the complex interchanging process among diverse knowledge bases with extraction of metainformation. In order to fuse knowledge according to not formats but connotation, the
paper contributes the Genetic Fusion Algorithm (GFA).
Knowledge fusion will result in an enormous amount of knowledge resources on
the web. In such settings, we encounter resources management and other challenges.
Since grid technologies carry the promise to enable widespread sharing and coordinated use of networked resources with effective scheme, we adopt a kind of semistructure data model to encapsulate data resources on the knowledge grid platform [5].
The purpose of this paper is to present a knowledge fusion architecture with an
autonomous resource allocation method used in the grid and the GFA for generating a
new knowledge space.

2 Architecture
The knowledge fusion is constructed on the Globus grid services. Figure 1 shows the
overall architecture.

Fig. 1. Framework of the grid based knowledge fusion system

The Globus project is the infrastructure of Grid computation. Globus Toolkit[6]
can run on several operating systems. When we extract meta-knowledge from any
node, the ontology should be described underlying certain rules and added into the
ontology base. In the following, we elaborate on this issue.
Ontology base is a complex description sets. It is much more difficult to model inference in such a distributed knowledge grid environment. Let O and Oi denote the
th
ontology base and the i object instance in it. The Oi will be used in the paper, which
is defined by
i

Oi = {(P j
i

，T ，D )} .

where P j denotes the j attribute of the object Oi, T j denotes the type of P j, D j denotes
its value, expression or behavior. The domain for variant j is decided by idiographic
scope knowledge ontology.

Let Sk denotes meta-knowledge sets of the k knowledge base node which can be
defined by

Relationships among character objects are not defined here because those will be
described in the ontology base. In order to implement the interchanged process bek
k
tween meta-knowledge sets and knowledge space, the definiendum (C i , E i) stands
for not embodied characters but denotative objects of knowledge ontology. That operation must be synchronous with the initializtion of meta-knowledge sets. Metaknowledge sets and ontology base are formalized to be fuse and generate new knowledge elements.

3 Fusion Algorithm
With a resource allocation method mentioned above, we contribute the GFA to generate a new knowledge space according to the embodiment of knowledge ontology.
Describe the supposition as constructing meta-knowledge sets, function as fusing
and generating new knowledge space.
GFA (Fitness, Fitness_threshold, p, r, m)

(3)

where Fitness denotes assessing function for fusion matching grade, which can endow the given supposition sets with a matching grade. Fitness_threshold denotes the
threshold value beyond which fusion process can not persist. p is a supposed number
which should be adjusted according to the result of unifying among diversiform metaknowledge sets. If dimension of some sets are too small, NULL can be used to instead
of it. r and m are intercross and aberrance percent.
Some description of the algorithm can be found in [7], the major steps are summarized as follows:
Select: Choose any Si and append it to Hs, let the counter c=1
if c< (1-r)p, do the following operation circularly:
choose any Sj not belonged to Hs from {Sk} - Si
i

if ∃ (P m , T m , D m) Oi , and P m = “R(C * , C *)” and D m NULL

or ∃ (P m , T m , D m) Oi , and P m = “R(C * , C *)” and D m NULL
append Sj to Hs , c++ .
Intercross: Selected result <S1 , S2> must make the following expression right:

this means the intersection of ontology relating to suppositions can not be temp. Any
element except the first one meets the requirement above can be intercrossed.
i

Aberrance: For each (C j , E j) , reverse its value as follows:
k
i
for every member S S of Hs ,
if Ol = {(P
∃ lm , Tlm , Dlm)} which can meet the requirement: j'∃, Plm = R(Cij , Ckj’)
k
k
and E j’ E j
k
k
E j’ is a result of reversing operation on E j .
Solution knowledge can be generated as follows:
Create ontology corresponding with question (Op) and meta-knowledge (restriction)
sets (Sp). Search all knowledge states in K for Sa whose relationship grade to question
state is the max. For each knowledge state related to question ontology, seek out its

relationship grade. It is also the percent of related knowledge points in knowledge
state and those in question state.
Knowledge state Sk relates to question ontology Op must meet requirement as follows:
∃ (Ppj , Tpj , Dpj) Op , (Pkj , Tkj , Dkj) Ok .

4 A Referential Application and Summary
Let us shift focus beyond the abstract architecture and point to a case study.
As shown above, the framework in the paper can minimize cost in a knowledge grid
especially when a knowledge fusion procedure runs on it. And it can also improve the
reuse performance of knowledge elements.
We present a new knowledge fusion framework in a grid environment. Compared
with traditional resource management system, method given in the paper gives more
flexibility on task requirements and resource utilization. We have also presented the
GFA which can fuse diversiform knowledge and generate new knowledge space
according to the connotation of ontology. In the future, we will apply the framework
to more finely granularity knowledge grid and optimize the matching process.
