Abstract. Large-scale protein interactions are known for several species due to
the recent improvements in experimental methods for detecting protein interactions. However, direct determination of all the interactions between the human
proteins is difficult even with current high-throughput methods. This paper describes a database server called HPID (http://www.hpid.org) that (1) provides
structural interactions between human proteins precomputed from existing
structural and experimental data and (2) predicts structural interactions between
proteins submitted by users. The structural interactions were obtained by finding known structural interactions of PDB in SCOP domains and then by finding
homologs of the domains in target proteins. Based on the structural interactions, we constructed two protein interaction maps, one for human and another
for yeast. We believe this is the first attempt to map a whole human interactome
at the superfamily level and to compare a human protein interaction map with
other species’ interaction map.

1 Introduction
One of today’s challenges in bioinformatics is to identify all the interactions of human
proteins. Large-scale protein interactions are known for several organisms due to the
development of high-throughput methods for detecting protein interactions, such as
two-hybrid method and mass spectrometry. However, determination of genome-wide
protein interactions by experimental methods is limited to low-order organisms such
as yeast and Helicobacter pylori [1, 2]. The genes of the human genome are known,
but direct determination of all the interactions between the human proteins is still
difficult even with high-throughput methods. An intrinsic problem with highthroughput methods is that protein interactions detected by the methods include many
false positives. In fact, more than half of current high-throughput data are estimated
to be spurious [3]. Considering these constraints, it is important to develop computational methods that can predict protein interactions, and compare different sets of
predicted or experimental data of protein interactions.

It has been widely conjectured that core structural protein interactions are conserved among different organisms. The number of distinct protein domains known so
far is around 1,000 (http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/, SCOP version used here is 1.57
unless otherwise stated) [4]. Therefore, it is inevitable that the same kind of protein
domains are involved in diverse types of protein-protein interactions [5]. We have
previously predicted protein interactions in human by homologous interactions in
yeast, and compared them [6]. However, the predicted interactions between human
proteins are estimated to contain many false positives partly because they are derived
from the experimental data of yeast protein interactions and the experimental data
themselves contain many false positives.
As an improvement of our previous study [6], we attempted to predict structural
protein interactions of human and yeast and to compare them. The structural protein
interactions are expected to be more accurate than the interactions obtained from the
previous study for the following reason. Protein interactions are predicted by finding
known structural interactions of PDB [7] in SCOP domains [4] and then by finding
homologs of the domains in human proteins. X-ray crystallography and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) were main methods for determining the structure data of
PDB, and they are more precise experimental techniques than the high-throughput
methods for detecting protein interactions.
The aim of this comparative study is to estimate the extent of protein superfamilies
in human structural interactome and examine how much overlap exists between the
two very diverse eukaryotes. The overall procedure from assigning protein folds to
the whole predicted proteome of the complete genomes to visualizing the large network of interactions forms a systematic methodology that can be applied to other
genomes. This pilot study can provide the major problems associated in such a bioinformatics analysis and a rough insight on the comparative structural interactomics.

2 Prediction Method
Structural interactions were determined based on the Protein Structural Interaction
Map (PSIMAP) [8], which classifies interactions between all known structural protein
superfamilies. Structures were assigned to the whole genome (predicted coding regions in the genome) by homology search. The level of homology interaction applied
is at the SCOP superfamily. This means that the estimated structural interactome of
human does not describe the protein-protein or domain-domain interactions at the
molecular level, but at the protein family level. This section starts with definitions of
the main concepts in the work.
Definition 1. Given a set P of proteins and a set S of protein structures in an organism, a set B of pairs of the form (protein, structure) shows the structure assignment to
proteins in the organism.

For the homology search, we constructed a composite database with 27,049 human
proteins (http://www.ensembl.org/, v7.29.1), 3,877 yeast proteins, SCOP proteins [4]
and NRDB90 [9]. PSI-BLAST [10] was run on the composite DB with SCOP domain
sequences as query sequences, the e-value threshold of 0.0005, and the maximum
number of profile search rounds of 10 (iterations above 5 does not bring a very high
number of distant homologs). The output of PSI-BLAST was parsed by our MS C#
program to extract human proteins and yeast proteins matched to SCOP domain sequences and the start and end positions of the matched parts.
Following algorithms describe the procedure for determining the reliability of the
predicted protein interactions. 42% of the predicted interactions between human proteins were ‘reliable’ and the rest 58% were ‘unknown’. Fig. 4 shows the data objects
used by the algorithms.

The database allows the user to infer potential interactions between proteins submitted by the user. Registration is required to use the online prediction service since
prediction results are maintained for individual users. The only required information
for registration is the email address, and a user ID and password for the user to use
when logging onto the database to view prediction results. When a registered user
logs onto to the database server, the status of the user’s previous job is displayed
regarding whether there is an error in the submitted protein sequences, and whether
homology search is complete, in progress, or has not been started yet.

3 Results and Discussion
A protein superfamily was assigned to a human protein (or yeast protein), in a conservative manner, when the matched part is 70% or longer of the original protein
superfamily. When multiple superfamilies were matched to a same location of a protein, a superfamily with the highest matching score was assigned to that location and
overlap of superfamilies was not allowed. 46% (12,550 proteins) of the total 27,049
human proteins were assigned one or more superfamilies. One human protein was
assigned 152 superfamilies and others were assigned 52 or fewer superfamilies (Fig.
5A). 39% (1,509 proteins) of the total 3,877 yeast proteins were assigned at least one
superfamily but no more than 6 superfamilies (Fig. 5B).

In order to assess the reliability of predicted interactions, we scored interactions
based on the identity value of matched parts. In human protein interactions the average identity (Χ) was 34% with standard deviation (σ) of 23% whereas the average
identity was 32% with standard deviation of 25% in yeast protein interactions. An
interaction (p1, p2) between proteins p1 and p2 was declared to have a high identity
score when both proteins p1 and p2 were assigned a superfamily with an identity ≥
Χ+σ. As shown in Table 1, 220,066 interactions between 2,424 human proteins had a
high identity (≥57%=34%+23%), whereas 1,127 interactions between 184 yeast
proteins had a high identity (≥57%=32%+25%). The 220,066 human protein interactions with a high identity correspond to 617 interactions at the superfamily level (i.e.,
at the PSIMAP data) and the 1,127 yeast protein interactions with a high identity
correspond to 157 interactions at the superfamily level. Yeast and human are evolutionarily distant species but 74.5% (117 interactions) of the 157 yeast interactions at
the superfamily-level were also found in human protein interactions.

interactions.

Fig. 6. The large maps visualize protein interactions at the superfamily level with a high identity in human and yeast (the last row of Table 1). Interaction maps at the protein level are
shown in boxes A and B for human and yeast, respectively (the second row of Table 1). Red
nodes represent superfamilies shared by human and yeast. A box at the lower right corner lists
proteins with superfamily ‘3.37.1’ assigned.

Fig. 6 shows protein interactions with a high identity both at the superfamily level
(the last row of Table 1) and at the protein level (the second row of Table 1), visualized by WebInterViewer [11]. Node ‘3.37.1’ has the largest number of interacting
superfamilies in both human and yeast. 3.37.1 is a p-loop containing hydrolase. It is
one of the most important protein structures occurring in all 4 superkingdoms of life.
Its functions are tightly related to energy metabolism such as ATP synthase and signal
transduction such as G-protein containing pathways. Therefore, it is not surprising
that it has diverse superfamily level structural interactions. Proteins with superfamily

‘3.37.1’ assigned were also listed in the lower right corner of Fig. 6. Node ‘2.1.1’ of
Fig. 6 (IG superfamily. b.1.1 in original SCOP versions) represents the immunoglobulin superfamily, which was found in human, but was missing in yeast assignment. This corroborates a well-known fact that immunoglobulin exists more predominantly in the high-order species only.
Fig. 7 shows many homologs of human proteins that have known homologs in
PDB as structural interaction pairs. One of the points of it is that the seemingly complicated interaction patterns in human can be reduced dramatically to a simple basic
backbone of family-family interactions. In smaller genomes, the same interaction
patterns are found but with much fewer homologs associated with the graph. It follows a scale-free network [12] in parameters. However, the result is a theoretical
estimation of human structural interactome. It is analogous to genome draft showing
the magnitude of the problem and a rough map for higher resolution mapping of
protein-protein interaction.

4 Conclusion
We constructed a database server for (1) providing structural interactions between
human proteins precomputed from existing structural and experimental data and for
(2) predicting structural interactions between proteins submitted by users. The structural interactions between human proteins were compared with those between yeast
proteins. They revealed a significant overlap in structural interactome (75%), showing
the high rate of conservation of structural interaction at the protein superfamily level.
Even though the portion of genes assigned to the whole genomes at present, this indi-

cates that the functional diversification of humans, on the large, is not correlated from
different or new interactions derived from new superfamilies. It is more likely that the
core structural interactions in life are tightly conserved and the functional diversification and species differentiation are more associated with complex regulatory differentiation. It is possibly related to subtle differentiation in interactions with a basic set
of protein structures and their interaction types. As illustrated in Fig. 7, a complicated
network of interacting proteins with many homologs can be dramatically reduced to a
single backbone network using the family-family interaction concept. The methodology applied here covers many different computational steps and forms a pipeline of
structural interactome analysis. Albeit partial, we believe this is the first bioinformatics attempt to map a whole human interactome and to compare a human protein interaction map with other species’ interaction map.
