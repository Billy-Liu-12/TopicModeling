Abstract. There is a tendency to cool mechanical and electrical
components by microchannels. When the channel size decreases, the
continuum approach starts to fail and particle based methods should be
used. In this paper, a dense gas in micro and nano-channels is modelled
by molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that
in the limit situation both methods yield the same solution. Molecular
dynamics is an accurate but computational expensive method. The
Monte Carlo method is more eﬃcient, but is less accurate near the
boundaries. Therefore a new coupling algorithm for molecular dynamics
and Monte Carlo is introduced in which the advantages of both methods
are used.

Introduction

There is a tendency that mechanical and electrical components become smaller
and smaller. Since most components produce heat when operating, it is essential
to cool them in order to perform well and to ensure the life span of such components. For example in computer chips, the power increases with a factor of 10
every 6 years [9]. The standard cooling techniques start to fail. Therefore, more
eﬃcient cooling techniques, like microchannel cooling with phase transition, are
necessary.
However when the channel size decreases, the continuum approach starts to
fail. At Knudsen numbers 0.1, particle based methods should be used. From a
physical point of view, molecular dynamics is a suitable method. From a computational point of view, this method is too expensive with respect to time to use
for microchannels. To handle larger time frames, a Monte Carlo approximation
is employed, but at the expense of less accuracy near the boundaries.
Our goal is to combine molecular dynamics with a Monte Carlo method such
that we can use the advantages of both methods: molecular dynamics near the
boundaries, because of the accuracy, and Monte Carlo in the bulk, because of
the lower computational costs.

In this paper, we consider both methods of modelling heat transfer in micro
and nano-channels and introduce a new algorithm in which molecular dynamics
and Monte Carlo codes with diﬀerent time stepping are coupled.

Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Methods

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation technique where the time
evolution of a set of interacting particles is followed. This is done by numerically
solving the equations of motion (Newton’s Second law) of classical multi-body
systems. Given the positions, masses and velocities of all particles in the system
and the forces on the particles, the motion of all (individual) particles can be
followed in time by calculating the (deterministic) single particle trajectories.
However, to calculate these trajectories is in general still very computationally
intensive, because in principal it is possible that every particle interacts with
every other particle in the system, resulting in N(N-1)/2 pair interactions for a
set of N particles that need to be calculated.
The interactions between the particles are given in the form of potentials. In
order to model a gas by almost hard sphere interactions we use a truncated and
shifted Lennard-Jones potential with a cut-oﬀ radius Rc = 21/6 σ. Where σ is
the collision diameter. For the simulations, we use the PumMa code developed
at the Eindhoven University of Technology [4].
The Monte Carlo (MC) method is based on the Direct Simulation Monte
Carlo method (DSMC) developed by Bird [3]. This DSMC method does not calculate the collisions exactly as in molecular dynamics, but generates collisions
stochastically with scattering rates and post-collision velocity distributions determined from the kinetic theory of a dilute gas. Several authors [7,8,10] used
this method successfully to study ﬂow and heat transfer in microchannels for a
dilute gas. However, for cooling purposes (high pressure or phase transition) we
have also to model a dense gas in a microchannel. Therefore the DSMC method
is modiﬁed by using the Enskog equation instead of the Boltzmann equation [5,
6]. In this MC method the collisions take place between particles inside a cell and
particles of neighbouring cells. The Enskog equation preserves the momentum
and energy of the system.
In order to be able to couple molecular dynamics with Monte Carlo, both
methods should give the same results for the limit situation where one artiﬁcial
particle in the Monte Carlo simulation represents one molecule in the molecular dynamics simulation. As validation the particle density distribution and the
temperature in a nanochannel are computed with both models. A nanochannel is
chosen because of the computational costs. However, the method holds for microchannels too. We approximate the nanochannel by two inﬁnite parallel plates
kept at two constant temperatures Tc = 120K and Th = 240K. Gas molecules are
conﬁned between these walls. The interaction between the gas molecules and the
walls is by thermal boundary conditions. A dense Argon gas is considered, with a
particle diameter R = 0.191 nm, the mean free path length λR = 0.346 nm, and

the initial uniform particle density n0 = 3.43 particles nm−3 . The total number
of particles is N = 20000.
The results for the MD and the MC codes are similar (ﬁg. 1) and are in good
agreement with Frezzotti’s results [6]. The heat is transferred from the cold to
the hot wall by the kinetic energy of the particles.

Coupling of MD with MC

As shown, both methods can be used to model the nanochannels. The MD
method is accurate but computational expensive, while the MC method, in which
an artiﬁcial particle represents several molecules, is more eﬃcient. However, the
boundary eﬀects are computed less accurate, because the artiﬁcial particles are
too large. The positions of the maxima and minima depend on the particle size.
Therefore the MC method deviates from the MD method when several molecules
are put in one MC particle. In order to get an accurate solution near the walls, a
detailed model is needed in which the particle diameter is equal to the molecular
diameter. MD is suited for that. In the bulk of the channel, the particle diameter
is not so critical. In this region the computations can be sped up by MC with
several molecules inside one artiﬁcial particle and by using larger time steps. So,
a coupling of MD with MC results in a fast and accurate solution.
In our coupling algorithm, the domain is divided into MD and MC subdomains and an interface between these subdomains is deﬁned (ﬁgure 2). The
coupling algorithm is as follows.

A.J.H. Frijns et al.

1. Assign particles to MD or MC part.
Particles are assigned to the MD or to the MC part depending on their
position. All particles in regions I and II (see ﬁgure 2A) are assigned to
the MD part and all particles in regions III and IV to the MC part. In the
ﬁgure the particles that have been assigned to molecular dynamics are white
whereas the MC particles are grey.
2. Perform N Molecular Dynamics time steps.
Depending on the respective time step sizes in the MD and MC part of the
simulation a certain number (N ) of MD steps corresponds with one single
MC step. These N MD steps are performed while keeping the positions of
the MC particles ﬁxed, as shown in ﬁgure 2B. The particles in region III
are necessary because, although they are ﬁxed in position, they can interact
with the MD particles.
3. Send particles in range II and III from MD to MC.
The molecular dynamics time steps should be followed by a time step of the
MC part. Before this can be done the particles in the interface regions II
and III should be sent to the MC. As shown in ﬁgure 2C, the particles are
removed from the MD simulation and added to the MC simulation.
4. Perform one MC time step.
One MC time step consists of two parts: an advection step and a collision
step. The advection step, i.e. moving the particles, is done only for the MC
(solid) particles, as shown in ﬁgure 2D. During the collision step collision
pairs are randomly selected with the restriction that at least one of the
particles should be a MC particle.
5. Send particles in range II and III from MC to MD.
After the MC step the particles that are now in ranges II and III are sent to
the MD simulation. Extra care should be taken here, because a MC particle
can overlap with another particle, whereas this is impossible for particles in
the molecular dynamics simulation. A solution to this problem is to check
whether a MC particle in range II is too close to any MD particle or other
MC particle in range II, and if so adding it a new random y and z position
while keeping the x position ﬁxed such that it no longer overlaps with any
other particles.
6. Start over with step 1.
By converting the MC particles that ended up in range II to MD particles
and vice versa MD particles that ended up in range III to MC particles (step
1) the next cycle of the simulation can be started.
Note that the MD and the MC steps are computed by diﬀerent codes. They are
coupled by an interface written in Python.

Results and Discussion

The algorithm is validated for the case in which the particles for the MC part
have the same size as in the MD part. However, the time steps are diﬀerent in
both domains: one MC time step equals ﬁve MD time steps. We consider the

nanochannel with the constant wall temperatures Tc = Th = 120K. The other
system parameters are chosen the same as in the ﬁrst example. The results are
plotted in ﬁgure 3.
It is shown that the coupling of MD with MC by this interface is functioning.
Some care must be taken at the artiﬁcial boundary between the MC and the
MD domains, because the MC particles do not move while the MD steps are
computed. In this way an artiﬁcial highly porous wall can be created. For dilute
gases, this eﬀect is negligible. However for a dense gas a small local disturbance
in the particle density occurs.

Future Research

In this paper, it is shown that the algorithm for the coupling of MD with MC is
functioning, but for a dense gas a small local disturbance in the particle density
will occur at the interface. For the future, we will adapt the algorithm such
that the local disturbance in the particle density will be minimised. To that end
the interaction between the MD and MC particles in region III (step 2) will be
improved by allowing small displacements of the MC particles. The next step
will be that the particles in the MC domain consist of several MD particles.
So, an extra step for combining several MD particles into one MC particle and
disintegrating of one MC particle into several MD particles will be added to the
algorithm. Finally, the eﬃciency of the algorithm will be studied in more detail.
