Abstract. In this paper we introduce a method, which is used for set
separation based on quantum computation. In case of no a-priori knowledge about the source signal distribution, it is a challenging task to
ﬁnd an optimal decision rule which could be implemented in the separating algorithm. We lean on the Maximum Likelihood approach and
build a bridge between this method and quantum counting. The proposed
method is also able to distinguish between disjunct sets and intersection
sets.

Introduction

In the course of signal and/or data processing fast classiﬁcation of the input
data is often helpful as a preprocessing step for decision preparation. Assuming
that the to be classiﬁed data µ ∈ M is well deﬁned and it came under a given
number of classes or sets, A := {µ ∈ M : A(µ)}, B := {µ ∈ M : B(µ)}, . . . , Z :=
{µ ∈ M : Z(µ)}. To perform the classiﬁcation is in such a way equivalent to a
set separation task.
The problem of separation could be manifold: sparsely distributed input data
makes the determination of the decision lines between the classes to a hard (often
nonlinear) task, or even the probability distribution of the input data is not
known a-priori which is resulted in an unsupervised classiﬁcation problem also
known as clustering [1]. Further ”open question” is to classify input sequences
in the case of only the original measurement/information data is known almost
sure, but the observed system adds a stochastically changing behavior to it, in
this manner the classiﬁcation becomes a statistical decision problem, which could
be extremely hard to solve if the number of ”possibilities” is increasing. Due to
this fact to ﬁnd an optimal solution is time consuming and yields broad ground
to suboptimal ones. With assistance of quantum computation we introduce an
optimal solution whose computational complexity is much lower contrary to the
classical cases.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2. the set separation related
quantum computation basics are highlighted. The system model is described in
Sect. 3. together with the proposed set separation algorithm in Sect. 4. The main
achievements are revised in Sect. 5.

Quantum Computation

In this section we give a brief overview about quantum computation which is
relevant to this paper. For more detailed description, please, refer to [2,3,4,5].
In the classical information theory the smallest information conveying unit is
the bit. The counterpart unit in quantum information is called the ”quantum bit”,
the qubit. Its state can be described by means of the state |ϕ , |ϕ = α|0 + β|1 ,
where α, β ∈ C refers to the complex probability amplitudes and |α|2 + |β|2 = 1
[2,3]. The expression |α|2 denotes the probability that after measuring the qubit
it can be found in computational base |0 , and |β|2 shows the probability to
be in computational base |1 . In more general description an N -bit ”quantum
register” (qregister) |ϕ is set up from qubits spanned by |x x = 0 . . . (N − 1)
computational bases, where N = 2n states can be stored in the qregisters at the
same time [6]
N −1

|ϕ =

ϕx |x ;

ϕx ∈ C,

(1)

x=0

where N denotes the number of states and ∀x = j, x|j = 0, x|x = 1,
|ϕx |2 = 1, respectively. It is worth mentioning, that a transformation U on
a qregister is executed parallel on all N stored states, which is called quantum parallelizm. To provide irreversibility of transformation, U must be unitary
U −1 = U † , where the superscript (†) refers to the Hermitian conjugate or adjoint
of U . The quantum registers can be set in a general state using quantum gates
[4,5] which can be represented by means of a unitary operation, described by a
quadratic matrix.

System Model

For the sake of simplicity a 2-dimensional set separation is assumed, where the
original source data can take the values µ ∈ M[0,1] and was chosen from the sets
s = 0 and s = 1. Additional information on the source is not available, e.g. also
nothing about the probability density function (pfd ). The general set separation
system is depicted in Fig. 1. The observed signal r, disturbed by the system A,
becomes the input data which will be separated into the two sets (s = 0 and
s = 1) again.
In the set separator a quantum register |ϕ –as described by equation (1) and
shown in Fig. 2.– is used to store all the parameters, e.g. delay, heat, velocity,
etc. values of the possible system disturbance in a specially given quantization12 .

Quantization is NOT a quantum computation operation!
The quantization method, i.e. linear or nonlinear is out of the scope of this paper.

As an example: in the qregister |ϕ , the properly prepared, quantized delay and
velocity values are stored, e.g. the values 1.0 · 10−1 , 1.1 · 10−1 , . . . , 1.0 · 10−10
and 1.0 m/s, 1.1 m/s, . . . , 100 m/s. This information is not utilizable so far but
the combination of this eﬀects, i.e. this values, whose extent could blast any
database. To handle the large amount of data to be processed a virtual database
should be introduced.
Deﬁnition 1 To build up a virtual database a function
y = g(s, x),

(2)

is deﬁned, where s ∈ S identiﬁes the sets and x denotes the index of the qregister
|ϕ , respectively. The function yi = g(s, xi ) points to an record in the virtual
database [7].
3.1

Properties of the Function g(·)

The function g(s, x) is not obligingly mutual unambiguous consequently, it is not
reversible, except for several special cases, when the virtual database contains
r = g(s, x) only once. In this case the parameter settings of the system A are
easy to determine. Nevertheless, the fact to have an entry only once in the virtual
database described by the equation g(si , x) does not exclude to have the same
entry in other virtual databases generated by g(sj , x), where i = j, which makes
a trivial decision impossible. Henceforth the fact should be kept in mind that
g(s, x) is in almost every case a so called one way function which is easy to
evaluate in one direction, but to estimate the inverse is rather hard.
The function g(.) generates all the possible disturbances additional to the
considered input value µ belonging to the set s = 0 or s = 1 of the system. This
is of course a large amount of information, 2N = 2n+1 , where n is the length of
the qregister |ϕ . For an example let us assume a 15-qbit qregister. The function
g(·) in (2) generates 215 = 32.768 output values at the same time for s = 0 and
the same number of outputs for s = 1. Taking into account the large number
of possible points in the set surface the optimal classiﬁcation in a classical way
becomes diﬃcult.

At the ﬁrst glace this problem looks more diﬃcult to solve, however, with
exploiting the enormous computational power of quantum computation, in this
case the Deutsch-Jozsa [8] quantum parallelization algorithm, an arbitrary unitary operation can be executed on all the prepared states contemporaneously.
3.2

Quantum Search in Qregister |ϕ

Roughly speaking the task is to ﬁnd the entry (entries) in the virtual databases
which is (are) equal to the observed data r. To accomplish the database search
the Grover database search algorithm should be invoked [9]. In Sect. 2. we proposed to set up an qregister, which has to be built up only one time at all. It is
obvious to choose a suitable database searching algorithm, to see which function
g0,1 (s0,1 , x) picking the vector x form qregister |ϕ contains the searched bit, if
any at all. We apply the optimal quantum search algorithm G, as depicted in
Fig. 3. proposed by Grover [10,11]. We feed the received signal r(t) to the oracle
(O), where the function f (r, g(s, x)) is evaluated such that
f (a, b) =

1 if a = b
0 otherwise.

where |α consists of such conﬁgurations of |x , which does not results µ = r,
while |β does.
Because of the fact of tight bound, in real application less iterations would
be also appropriate [12].

Set Separation

Let us turn our interest back to the separation of the observed data r from the
predeﬁned sets.
Assuming the special case where only one of the virtual database descriptor
functions, either g(s0 , x) or g(s1 , x) contains the entry identical to the observed
data r a set separation can be performed easily.
A more realistic case is to have an intersection part of the two sets as shown
in Fig. 4. Even so, due to passing the observed system, overlapping of the sets
can be occurred due to disturbances. After evaluating the functions g0,1 (s0,1 , x)
it could happen that the same records are multiple present, which shows the
irreversibility behavior of the function (2). Originally, the input signal was chosen
from well deﬁned disjunct sets without a-priori known probability distributions.
The process, to put r to a set either to s0 or to s1 should be based on Maximum
Likelihood decision.
Let us assume that we have a random variable r. Its measured value depends
on a selected element xl from a ﬁnite set (l = 1, . . . , L) and a process which
can be characterized by means of a conditional pdf f (r|xl ) belonging to the
given element. Our task is to decide which xl was selected if a certain r has
been measured. Each guess Hl for xl can be regarded as a hypothesis. Therefore
decision theory is dealing with design and analysis of suitable rules building
connections between the set of observations and hypotheses.
If we are familiar with the unconditional (a priori) probabilities P (xl ) then
the Bayes formula helps us to compute the conditional (a posteriori) probabilities
P (Hi |r) in the following way
f (r|xl )P (xl )

P (Hl |r) =

L
i=1

f (r|xi )P (xi )

.

Obviously the most pragmatic solution if one chooses Hl belonging to the largest
P (Hl |r). This type of hypothesis testing is called maximum a posteriori (MAP)
decision.
If the a priori probabilities are unknown or xl is equiprobable then maximum
likelihood (ML) decision can be used. It selects Hl resulting the largest f (r|xl )
when the observed r is substituted in order to minimize the probability of error
max L(r, xl ).

Fig. 5. The two density functions f (r|s = 0) and f (r|s = 1)

The Maximum Likelihood estimator requires to know the probability density
function of the observed signal. Employing the Grover database search algorithm
we are able to ﬁnd the entries in the virtual databases, however, it is not needed
to perform a complete search because the search result –the exact index (indices)
of the searched item(s)– is (are) not interesting but the number how often a given
conﬁguration is involved in g(s, x) or not. For that purpose a new function f (·)
is deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 2 The function
f (r|s) =

(x : r = g(s, x))
,
(x)

(5)

counts the number of similar entries in the virtual database, which corresponds
to the conditional probability density function r to be in the set s.
For that reason it is worth stepping forward to quantum counting [13] based on
Grover iteration.
4.1

Set Separation Method

The both curves in Fig. 5. represent the number of the same entries in the virtual
databases, i.e. the pdf’s, according to f (r|s = 0) and f (r|s = 1), respectively.
In case of having entry(entries) only in yi but not in yj of function g0,1 (s0,1 , x),
where i, j ∈ [0, 1], and i = j, means a 100 percent sure decision, following the
decision rules in Table 1. This areas are the non-overlapping parts of the sets
in Fig. 4. and the outer parts (until the vertical dashed black lines) in Fig. 5.
However, in the case of non zero f (r|s = 0) and f (r|s = 1) values an accurate
prediction can be given relating to the Maximum Likelihood decision rule.
All the possible states from the qregister |ϕ will be evaluated by the function
(2) for s = 0 and also for s = 1, simultaneously, which will be collated with the
system output r. If at least one output y0 or y1 with the parameter settings x

is matched to the system output r, it will be put to the set s = 0 or s = 1,
respectively. In a more exciting case at least one similarity of y0 and also at least
one of y1 to r is given, the system output could be classiﬁed to the both sets, an
intersection is drawn up. This result in a not certainty prediction, which piques
our interest and sets our focus not this juncture.
We assume no a-priori knowledge on the probability distribution of the input
sequence µ, so it is assumed to be equally distributed. Henceforward we suppose
that after counting the evaluated values f (r|s = i) the number of similarity to
the system output r is higher than in case of f (r|s = j), where i, j ∈ [0, 1]. In
pursuance of the decision rule in Table 1., r belongs rather to set s = i than to
set s = j.
The Method. To perform a set separation nothing else is required as
1. Prepare the qregister |ϕ ,
2. Evaluate the functions yi = gi = (s = i, x), where i ∈ [0, 1] in 2-dimensional
case,
3. Count the identical entries in the virtual databases which are equal to the
observed data r, f (r|s), (see Fig. 5).,
4. Use the decision table Table 1 to assign r to the sets s = 0 or s = 1.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper we showed a connection between Maximum Likelihood hypothesis
testing and Quantum Counting used for quantum set separation. We introduced
a set separation algorithm based on quantum counting which was employed to
estimate the conditional probability density function of the observed data in
consideration to the belonging sets. In our case the pdf ’s are estimated fully
at a single point by invoking the quantum counting operation only once, that
makes the decision facile and sure. In addition one should keep in mind that
the qregister |ϕ have to be set up only once before the separation. The virtual
databases are generated once and directly leaded to the Oracle of the Grover
block in the quantum counting circuite, which reduce the computational complexity, substantially.
