Abstract. A new Bayer pattern demosaicking scheme for single-sensor
digital cameras is introduced. The raw output from a sensor, mostly a
charge coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor, with a Bayer ﬁlter represents a mosaic of red,
green and blue pixels of diﬀerent intensity. To interpolate the two missing color components in each spatial location and constitute the full
color, camera output, the proposed method utilizes edge-sensing interpolation and correction steps. Since the correction step is suitable only
for the image regions with high spectral correlation, otherwise is counter
productive, the scheme is adaptively controlled through the comparisons
between the correlation coeﬃcient and the pre-determined parameter.
The proposed method yields excellent performance, in terms of subjective and objective image quality measures, and outperforms previously
developed CFA interpolation solutions.

Introduction

Single-sensor digital color cameras use color ﬁlter array (CFA) to separate incoming light into a speciﬁc spatial arrangement of the color components. Most
popular solutions utilize a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) Bayer CFA pattern shown
in Fig. 1 [2]. The raw output from a sensor, mostly a charge coupled device
(CCD) or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor, with a
Bayer ﬁlter represents a mosaic of red, green and blue pixels of diﬀerent intensity. Since the two color components are missing in each spatial location (Fig.
2), they must be interpolated from the spatially adjacent CFA data. The process
of interpolating missing spectral components is known as CFA interpolation or
demosaicking.
The proposed demosaicking method produces the full color, camera output
using edge-sensing interpolation and correction steps. After initial interpolation
of the G components, the method utilizes color-diﬀerence model of [1] to generate
R and B estimates using both R and G or B and G components, respectively.
Thus, the procedure produces more accurate outputs compared to the schemes
operating on R or B components, only. In the next step, the color appearance of
the restored image is improved, ﬁrst through the correction of the interpolated G

components and then increasing precision of the previously interpolated R and
B components. To restrict the correction process only for the image regions with
high correlation among the spectral components, the local correlation characteristics are compared to the pre-determined parameter. This preserves image
quality in the regions with weak correlation, where the correction step may be
counter productive.

Color Filter Array Basics

Let us consider, a K1 × K2 gray-scale image z(i) : Z 2 → Z representing a twodimensional matrix of integer samples. In the Bayer CFA pattern, half of the
pixels zi ∈ Z 2 , for i = 1, 2, ..., K1 K2 , correspond to the G channel, whereas R,B
channels are assigned the other half of the pixels. Assuming that p = 1, 2, ..., K1
and q = 1, 2, ..., K2 denote the spatial position of the pixels in vertical (image
rows) and horizontal (image columns) directions, gray-scale pixels zi can be
transformed into the RGB vectors xi = (xi1 , xi2 , xi3 ) ∈ Z 2 , for i = (p−1)K2 +q,
as follows:

 (zi , 0, 0) for p odd and q even
xi = (0, 0, zi ) for p even and q odd
(1)

(0, zi , 0) otherwise

This transformation forms a K1 × K2 RGB image x(i) : Z 2 → Z 3 representing a two-dimensional matrix of three-component samples. Note that the color
vectors xi relate to one true component varying in k from position to position,
whereas other two components of xi are set to zero. Estimating the missing color
components of x(i) constitutes the interpolated RGB image y(i) : Z 2 → Z 3 .
This process relates to a sliding supporting window W = {xi ∈ Z 2 ; i =
0, 1, ..., N − 1} of ﬁnite size N , considered with the sample under consideration,
sample x0 , placed in the center of the window (Fig. 3a). The procedure replaces
the center x0 by some function of the local neighborhood area {x1 , x2 , ..., xN −1 }
at a time. The rationale of this approach is to minimize the local distortion and
ensure the stationarity of the processes generating the image.

Demosaicking Approach Based on the Local-Correlation
Characteristics

To follow structural information and interpolate missing image components in
sharp shapes, eﬃcient interpolation algorithms incorporate edge information into
the interpolation process. The proposed method utilizes the edge-sensing mechanism of [8]:
1
√
(2)
w1 =
1 + (|z0 − z9 | + |z1 − z5 |) /(2 2)
1
w2 =
(3)
1 + (|z0 − z11 | + |z2 − z6 |) /2
where w1 and w2 denote weights in north-west and north directions. The original gray-scale values {z0 , z1 , ..., z24 } ∈ z(i) have an spatial arrangement shown
in (Fig.3b). The weighting coeﬃcients w3 , w5 , w7 and w4 , w6 , w8 are calculated
applying appropriately the concept of (2) and (3), respectively.
Using eight weighting coeﬃcients, the G channel is interpolated as follows:
y¯02 =

x02

N −1
i=1

wi xi2

if z0 ∼
= x02
otherwise

(4)

where N = 9 relates to a 3 × 3 sliding window, z0 is the acquired gray-scale
component positioned in the interpolated location, operator ∼
= denotes a one
N −1
to one relationship and wi = wi / j=1 wj is the normalized weighting coeﬃcient corresponding to pre-determined G values xi2 . For illustration purposes,
quantities x(1)2 and x(2)2 are given by:
√
x(1)2 = x(2)2 + x(8)2 /2 + ((z1 − z5 )/(2 2) + (z11 − z0 + z23 − z0 )/4)/2 (5)
x(2)2 = x(2)2 + (z11 − z0 + z2 − z6 )/4

(6)

Using the color-diﬀerence model of [1] and the G values obtained in (4), the
R and B channels are estimated as follows:

if z0 ∼

 x0k

where k = 1 and k = 3 characterize the R and B components, respectively, and
the quantities f(2i)k and f(2i−1)k are deﬁned via
f(2i)k =
f(2i−1)k =

(N −1)/2

(N −1)/2

with the normalized weights wi = w2i j=1
w2j corresponding to edges
in north, east, south and west directions. The weighting coeﬃcients wi =
(N −1)/2
w(2j−1) correspond to diagonally positioned edges.
w(2i−1) / j=1
The utilization of the correction mechanism in the interpolation process improves contrast and accuracy of the initially interpolated G channel. Using the
color-diﬀerence quantities similarly as in (7), the G values are corrected as follows:
y¯0k + g(2i)k if z0 ∼
= x0k
y02 =
(10)
y¯02
otherwise
(N −1)/2

wi (¯
y(2i)2 − y¯(2i)k ) is deﬁned using the weighting coefwhere g(2i)k = i=1
ﬁcients wi of (7).
Considering the corrected G values of (10) the update of R and B components
is completed using the proposed approach as follows:


where
h(2i)k =

(N −1)/2

wi (¯
y(2i)k − y(2i)2 )

The correction procedure of (11) is performed only in image regions with the
high spectral correlation. The method utilizes correlation characteristics (Fig.4)
between the interpolated G channel of y
¯(i) and the original R,B channels of x(i).
The correlation coeﬃcient Ck is deﬁned over a 3 × 3 neighborhood as follows:
Ck =

where i, for zi ∼
= xik , characterizes the spatial position of the samples corresponding to the original position of R,B values in the Bayer pattern. The mean
values x
ˆk and yˆ2 denote sample mean values related to the k-th original CFA
components and the interpolated G components, respectively. Experimentation
with a wide set of the test images showed that the correction operations should
be performed in the image areas, where the local correlation coeﬃcient is larger
than β = 0.125.

Experimental Results

A number of test color images have been used to evaluate the proposed demosaicking scheme. Examples are shown in Fig. 5. These images have been captured
using professional three-sensor digital cameras. To facilitate the comparisons, the
images have been normalized to a standard size of 512 × 512 pixels with a 8bits per channel RGB representation. Since the original Bayer image is usually
unavailable in order to obtain test Bayer image data used in CFA interpolation
researchers sample original images with the Bayer CFA pattern [10],[11].
The restored outputs are obtained using demosaicking (CFA interpolation)
solutions. Results obtained via the proposed method are compared with those
obtained using the bilinear interpolation (BI) scheme [10], the high deﬁnition
color interpolation (HDCI) scheme [7], the median ﬁltering (MFI) scheme [5], the
eﬀective color interpolation (ECI) approach [11], the alternative projection (AP)

approach [6], the color correlation directional derivative (C2D2) scheme [8], the
smooth hue transition approach (SHT) [4], the saturation based adaptive inverse
gradient (SAIG) [3], and the Kimmel’s algorithm (KA) [9]. The eﬃciency of the
all these methods is measured, objectively, via the mean square error (MSE) and
the normalized color diﬀerence criterion (NCD) [7].
Table 1 summarizes the results corresponding to restoration of the test images
shown in Fig. 5. As it can be observed the conventional BI scheme introduces signiﬁcant inaccuracy into the restoration process. Other techniques such as HDCI,
MFI, ECI, AP, C2D2, SAIG and KA which utilize more advanced interpolators
compared to the BI scheme, provide better results in terms of both objective criteria. It has to be mentioned that some sophisticated algorithms such as HDCI,
SAIG, and KA often fail in image scenarios with color corresponding to zero or
very small portion of any additive primary. In such a case, the aforementioned
schemes produce color artifacts.

Figure 6 facilitates the visual comparison of zoomed parts corresponding to
the original images as well as the restored outputs obtained using the methods
under consideration. Results indicate that the BI and HDCI schemes blur image
edges and delete both structural content and ﬁne details ( Fig. 6f,g). The MFI,
ECI, AP and C2D2 approaches exhibit improved detail-preserving characteristics ( Fig. 6h-k). It can be seen that the proposed method preserves the image
details and avoids color artifacts ( Fig. 6l). Excellent design characteristics of the
proposed method allow to restore the image with the highest ﬁdelity compared
to the original. At the same time, the proposed solution preserves the original
structural content. This results in visually pleasing, naturally colored outputs.

Conclusion

A new, edge-sensing CFA interpolation approach for single-sensor digital cameras was presented. The method utilizes local correlation characteristics and
a color-diﬀerence model to produce full color camera output. Excellent design
characteristics of the proposed method result in sharp, naturally colored interpolated images. At the same time, this produces signiﬁcant improvements and
excellent results compared to the previously developed CFA interpolation methods.
