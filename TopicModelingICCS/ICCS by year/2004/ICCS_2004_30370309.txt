Abstract. Determining the binding sites in protein-nucleic acid complexes is
essential to the complete understanding of protein-nucleic acid interactions and
to the development of new drugs. We have developed a set of algorithms for
analyzing protein-nucleic acid interactions and for predicting potential binding
sites in protein-nucleic acid complexes. The algorithms were used to analyze
the hydrogen-bonding interactions in protein-RNA and protein-DNA
complexes. The analysis was done both at the atomic and residue level, and
discovered several interesting interaction patterns and differences between the
two types of nucleic acids. The interaction patterns were used for predicting
potential binding sites in new protein-RNA complexes.

1 Introduction
A variety of problems concerned with protein-DNA interactions have been
investigated for many years, but protein-RNA interactions have been much less
studied despite their importance. One reason for this is that only a small number of
protein-RNA structures were known. As a result, these structures were generally
studied manually on a small-scale. The task of analyzing the protein-RNA binding
structures manually becomes increasingly difficult as the complexity and number of
protein-RNA binding structures increase. Now that an increasing number of proteinRNA structures are known, there is a need to automatically analyze the interactions
involved and to compare them with protein-DNA interactions.
In contrast to the regular helical structure of DNA, RNA molecules form complex
secondary and tertiary structures consisting of elements such as stems, loops, and
pseudoknots. Generally only specific proteins recognize a given configuration of such
structural elements in three-dimensional space. RNA forms hydrogen bonds and
electrostatic interactions, and possess hydrophobic groups; it can therefore make
specific contacts with small molecules. However, the basis of its interaction with
proteins is unclear. In our previous study of protein-RNA complexes, we analyzed the
interaction patterns between the protein and RNA at the level of residues and atoms
[1]. As an extention of the previous study, we attempted to predict potential binding
sites in protein-nucleic acid complexes by analyzing the hydrogen-bonding (H* This work was supported by the Ministry of Information and Communication of Korea under

bonding) interactions between the amino acids of proteins and the nucleotides of
nucleic acids.

2 Types of Hydrogen Bonding Interactions
Hydrogen bonds were classified into 3 types: (1) single interactions in which one
hydrogen bond is found between an amino acid and a nucleotide, (2) bidentate
interactions where an amino acid forms two or more hydrogen bonds with a
nucleotide or base-paired nucleotides, and (3) complex interactions where an amino
acid binds to more than one base step simultaneously [1]. Our definition of hydrogen
bond types is slightly different from that of Luscombe et al. [2]. The latter only
analyzed hydrogen bonds between amino acids and bases, whereas we also consider
hydrogen bonds with the RNA backbone. Therefore, our study can reveal differences
in binding propensities between bases, sugar groups and phosphate groups.

3 Frameworks
3.1 Datasets
Protein-RNA complex structures were obtained from the PDB database [3].
Complexes solved by X-ray crystallography at a resolution ≤ 3.0Ǻ were selected. As
of September 2002, there were 188 protein-RNA complexes in PDB, and 139 of them
were at a resolution ≤ 3.0 Ǻ. We used PSI-BLAST [4] for similarity searches on each
of the protein and RNA sequences in these 139 complexes in order to eliminate
equivalent amino acids or nucleotides in homologous protein or RNA structures. 64
out of 139 protein-RNA complexes were left as the representative, non-homologous
complexes after running the PSI-BLAST program with an E value of 0.001 and an
identity value of 80% or below. We excluded 13 out of the 64 complexes that have no
water molecules or are composed of artificial nucleotides. Table 1 lists the 51 proteinRNA complexes in the final data set. For the dataset of protein-DNA complexes, we
used 129 protein-DNA complexes used in the study of Luscombe [2].

3.2 Hydrogen Bonds
The number of hydrogen bonds between the amino acids and nucleotides in the
protein-RNA complexes was calculated using CLEAN, a program for tidying
Brookhaven files, and HBPLUS [5], a program to calculate the number of hydrogen
bonds. The hydrogen bonds were identified by finding all proximal atom pairs
between hydrogen bond donors (D) and acceptors (A) that satisfy the given geometric
criteria. The positions of the hydrogen atoms (H) were theoretically inferred from the
surrounding atoms, because hydrogen atoms are invisible in purely X-ray-derived
structures. The criteria considered to form the hydrogen bonds for this study were:
contacts with a maximum D-A distance of 3.9 Å, maximum H-A distance of 2.5 Å,
and minimum D-H-A and H-A-AA angles set to 90°, where AA is an acceptor
antecedent (see Fig. 1).
All protein-RNA bonds were extracted from the HBPLUS output files. There were
1,568 hydrogen bonds in the dataset. We conducted separate experiments in order to
compare the properties of single interactions, bidentate interactions and complex
interactions, and the results were analyzed for the three types of hydrogen bonds: (1)
single interactions, (2) bidentate interactions, and (3) complex interactions.

4 Algorithms
4.1 Analysis Algorithm
As shown in Fig. 2, the analysis algorithm is composed of 4 phases. In phase 1, the
algorithm constructs arrays to store the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences,
respectively, and classifies hydrogen bonds. These arrays and lists are used to
determine interaction types. The algorithm also analyzes whether a nucleotide is
paired with other nucleotides. It is essential to discriminate whether binary or multi
bond is single interaction or not. So, it is used to classify the interaction types. These
processes are the basis of phases 2–4 of the algorithm.
In phase 2, the algorithm investigates the internal hydrogen bond relations of the
nucleic acid and records the result of the investigation in a linked-list. It also
investigates the hydrogen bonds between the protein and nucleic acid and records this
result in a linked-list. These processes are important groundwork for identifying

312

N. Han and K. Han

binding patterns as they represent the relation between pairs of residues in the form of
linked-lists. These are then used in phase 4 to parse the classified interaction types.
In phase 3, the algorithm classifies the bonding type of each amino acid into
unitary, double and multi-bond based on the number of hydrogen bonds between the
amino acid and the nucleic acid. It inspects whether the amino acid forms two or more
hydrogen bonds with the base or base pair. This is one of the most important
processes because it can directly identify the double bond of the bidentate interaction.
Since double bonds are abundant, it can eliminate many unnecessary operations.
In phase 4, the algorithm parses the outcomes of phase 3 to determine binding
patterns and numbers of hydrogen bonds involving each region of nucleotides and
amino acids. The analysis is done both at the atomic and residue level, and the results
help us identify how proteins recognize binding targets, which nucleotides are favored
by which amino acids, and their binding sites.
4.2 Prediction Algorithm
The prediction algorithm is composed of two phases. In phase 1, it splits unknown
protein structure into dices and examines all dices to sort potential binding sites with
high probability. Splitting the protein structure requires the coordinate values of all
atoms and the center position of every residue. Every PDB file of a structure has the
starting coordinate value, which is outside the structure. The algorithm selects the
closest residue from the starting coordinates of the structure. It then finds neighbor
residues of the closest residue and the residues within a dice.
In phase 2, the algorithm constructs the structure-based residue lists that contain
structural information for each dice. It then compares the lists to the nucleic acid
sequence to predict potential binding sites using the interaction propensities and
patterns. All potential binding sites are examined to predict the best binding site
candidate. The structure information was used to eliminate spurious candidates at the
last step of prediction. For example, a potential binding site with interaction between
sheets in proteins and stems in RNA or DNA is eliminated, since the sheet structure in
proteins prefers the loop structure in RNA or DNA. More details are explained in
section 5.3.

5 Results
5.1 Differences between DNA and RNA
In protein-DNA complexes, almost equal numbers of hydrogen bonds were involved
in single, bidentate and complex interactions [2]. However, in protein-RNA
complexes, 60% of the hydrogen bonds were found in single interactions.
RNA and DNA were different in their preference for backbone versus base
contacts. 32% of the hydrogen bonds between protein and DNA involved base
contacts, compared with 50% in protein-RNA. This can be explained by the structural
difference between RNA and DNA. DNA is a double stranded molecule, and its bases
are therefore already involved in hydrogen bonding. Hence, the base region is not as
flexible as the backbone and is therefore less able to bind to amino acids. The bases in
single-stranded regions of RNA, on the other hand, are quite flexible.
DNA and RNA were also different in their favored amino acids. GLU and ASP
have acidic side chain groups, and more frequently hydrogen bind to RNA than to
DNA. In protein-RNA complexes, these two amino acids are ranked 5th and 7th,
respectively, but in protein-DNA complexes they are ranked 11th and 12th (Table 2).
In particular, both GLU and ASP bind very frequently to guanine in the protein-RNA
complexes (Table 3). The opposite is the case with GLY and ALA, which bind to
DNA more often than to RNA. They rank 10th and 14th, respectively in protein-RNA
complexes, but 5th and 9th in protein-DNA complexes. Both GLY and ALA have
non-polar side chains, and residues with small side chains bind to double stranded
DNA more easily than those with large side chains.

5.2 Interaction Propensities and Patterns in Protein-RNA Complexes
In bidentate interactions, GLU and ASP mainly bind to guanine whereas THR and
LYS generally bind to adenine. This binding preference results in characteristic
patterns of binding between the amino acid and nucleotide pairs (Table 3 and Figure
3). For example, the binding pattern shown in the GLU–G pair is most common. An
exception is LYS: there are 69 hydrogen bonds between LYS and adenine bases, but
there is no prominent binding pattern.
In protein-RNA complexes, the side chain of an amino acid binds to the only one
base rather than base pairs or base steps. In contrast, there are many hydrogen bonds
between a side chain and a base pair or base step in protein-DNA complexes [3]. This
difference can again be explained by the structural difference between RNA and
DNA.

5.3 Structural Propensities and Binding Sites
Protein helices bind equally to nucleotide pairs and non-pairs in H-bonding
interactions. In contrast, sheets prefer non-pairs to pairs, and turns prefer pairs to nonpairs. Non-pairs have been considered to have high interaction propensity in general,
but our study found this is not the case since turns prefer pairs and helices show no
preference. In protein-RNA complexes, this implies that sheets prefer to bind to RNA
loops and turns prefer to bind to RNA stems [6].

both known and predicted binding sites of the NS5B part of Hepatitis C Virus. The
predicted binding sites do not exactly correspond to the known binding sites.
However, all predicted binding sites are found near or within the known binding sites,
and therefore can reduce the region of potential binding sites effectively.

6 Discussion
We have developed a set of algorithms for analyzing H-bonding interactions and
nucleic acids and for predicting potential binding sites between amino acids. This
paper presents the results of such an analysis and compares the characteristics of RNA
and DNA binding to proteins and prediction results.
The protein-RNA complexes display specific binding patterns. In bidentate
interactions in protein-RNA complexes, GLU and ASP overwhelmingly bind to
guanine while THR and LYS generally bind to adenine. DNA binds to GLY and ALA
preferentially, whereas RNA usually does not binds to them but rather to GLU and
ASP. This binding preference results in favored binding patterns. For example, the
binding pattern of the GLU–G pair is the most common.
The binding patterns obtained from analyzing H-bonding interactions between
amino acids and nucleotides were used to predict potential binding sites of proteinnucleic acid complexes. The binding sites predicted by our algorithm do not exactly
correspond to the known binding sites, but it can reduce the region of potential
binding sites and the unnecessary experiments. This indicates that prediction was
performed in a conservative manner. However, a more rigorous study is required to
improve the prediction results for various test cases.
