Abstract. The design of spatial missions to Mars requires the development of analytical theories in order to put artiﬁcial satellites in orbit
around Mars.
In this paper, we present a complete third order analytical model of a
satellite perturbed by the zonal J2 , . . . , J6 harmonics of the Mars potential. Two Lie transformations, the elimination of the Parallax and
the elimination of the Perigee, and the Krylov–Bogoliubov–Mitropolsky
method are applied to obtain a complete integration of the model. The
algebraic expressions of the generators, the Hamiltonians and the integrals, together with a software code to compute the ephemeris of the
satellite, are automatically obtained using our computer algebra system
ATESAT.

Introduction

Mars is one of the main challenges for the aerospace community. Since 1965,
when the Mariner IV made the ﬁrst successful ﬂyby of Mars, man has wanted
to reach the planet. The study of the Martian topography, gravity surface composition, atmospheric structure, etc., depends on the orbital missions around
Mars. Besides, the possibility of future manned missions to Mars forces to select
brief parking orbits with a precise analytical determination of the position of the
satellite [9].
The interest of the Centre National D’Etudes Spatiales (CNES, France) in
this kind of orbiters, together with the experience of the Space Mechanics Group
(GME) of the University of Zaragoza in obtaining analytical theories of Earth
artiﬁcial satellites by using symbolic computational tools, drove us to collaborate
in order to obtain an analytical theory of a Martian artiﬁcial satellite with an
error less than one kilometer in one month. To this aim, we used the same
methods as those applied to Earth satellites.
The Lie–Deprit method [7] based on Lie canonical transformations was used
to develop eﬃcient analytical theories of the satellite problem. To obtain our
theory we applied two Lie transformations: the elimination of the Parallax and
the elimination of the Perigee. After these eliminations, the simpliﬁed Hamiltonian was reduced to one degree of freedom. To obtain a theory without singularities in eccentricity and inclination and without series expansions in eccentricity,
we applied the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky (KBM) method instead of the
classical Delaunay normalization. Both, the Lie-Deprit method and the KBM
technique are very well suited methods for symbolic computation.

In general, during the computing of an analytical theory in the artiﬁcial satellite problem one has to cope with long series expansion, handling a huge amount
of terms and particular objects like the so-called Poisson series1 . This makes
general purpose algebraic manipulators ineﬀective and forces to create speciﬁc
computer algebra systems to handle these type of objects in an eﬃcient way.
Our software ATESAT ([2,3,13]) uses the Poisson Series Processor PSPC [1,14]
to generate automatically analytical theories and their corresponding ephemeris
programs for satellite orbits.
With ATESAT we developed the complete third order theory of the motion
of an artiﬁcial satellite perturbed by the ﬁrst sixth order zonal harmonics of the
potential of Mars. With this theory we obtained the required precision; in fact
the error for a wide range of initial conditions is less than 400 meters per month.

α is the equatorial radius, Jn are the zonal harmonic coeﬃcients, si = sin i =
1 − (N 2 /Θ2 ), is a function of the momenta N and Θ, and the small parameter
is the Martian constant of oblateness.
The variable ν is cyclic in the zonal problem, and therefore we have a dynamical system with two degrees of freedom.

Canonical Lie Transformations

A Lie transformation [7,10,11] can be deﬁned as an inﬁnitesimal contact transformation ϕ : (y, Y , ) → (x, X), such that x(y, Y ; ), X(y, Y ; ) satisfy the
diﬀerential equations
dx

i
x, X, y, Y ∈ IRm , and W =
i≥0 ( /i!) Wi+1 (x, X) is the generator of the
transformation.
In the particular case of the Hamiltonian formalism, a Lie transformation
i
converts a Hamiltonian H(x, X; ) =
i≥0 ( /i!)Hi,0 (x, X) into a new one
K(y, Y ; ) = i≥0 ( i /i!)H0,i (y, Y ) by means of the relations

(4)

where ( ; ) stands for the Poisson bracket. Equation (4) is called Lie triangle.
Note that with this approach, there appear many intermediate terms Hp,q which
must be computed and stored.
The Lie-Deprit method [7] tries to ﬁnd the generator of a Lie transformation
to turn the Hamiltonian into a new one satisfying some preﬁxed conditions.
This method looks for the generator order by order. Once the order (n − 1) is
solved we know the expressions of Wi , i = 0, . . . , n − 1 and Hp,q , p + q ≤ n − 1.
By joining the equations in (4) for p + q = n, we ﬁnd the homological equation
˜ n,0 ,
L0 Wn = (H0 , Wn ) = H0,n − H

(5)

˜ n,0 can be computed from the previous orders by means of the Lie
where H
triangle. To solve the order n, we must follow three steps:
˜ n,0 from the expressions of order (n − 1).
1. Compute H
2. Choose H0,n .
3. Find an integral Wn of the homological equation.
3.1

Elimination of the Parallax

The ﬁrst step of this theory looks for a Lie transformation called elimination of
the Parallax. This canonical transformation [8] reduces the complexity, not the
number of degrees of freedom, of the Hamiltonian (1). Besides, the elimination
of the Parallax algorithm allows us to compute the expression in a close form of
the eccentricity, and therefore to obtain general purpose theories valid for any
kind of elliptic eccentricity.

Cj , Sj ∈ ker(L0 )}. Particularly, using the C = e cos g, S = e sin g and p =
a(1 − e2 ) functions of the orbital elements a, e and g, the Hamiltonian (1) can
be expressed as a function of F if we take into account the relations 1/r = 1/p +
C/p cos θ + S/p sin θ, R = CΘ/p sin θ − SΘ/p cos θ, since C, S, p, Θ ∈ ker(L0 ).

After the Parallax elimination, the transformed Hamiltonian and the generator of third order, expressed as a Poisson Series, have 176 and 1837 terms,
respectively. The number of terms of the direct and inverse expression of this

Elimination of the Perigee

Apparently, the elimination of the Parallax removes the argument of latitude θ,
however, this variable appears implicitly in the state functions C and S, which
are functions of the perigee g. In order to reduce the problem, we can eliminate
the perigee by applying a new Lie transformation whose generator has two terms
Wn = Wn∗ (C, S, Θ, θ) + W˜n (C, S, Θ, ),
Wn∗ , which depends on θ, and W˜n , which does not depend on θ. The Lie operator

This algorithm called elimination of the Perigee [5] is applied to remove
the argument of the perigee g from the perturbation. This elimination is not a
normalization in the sense that the transformed Hamiltonian does not belong to
the kernel of the Lie derivative L0 associated with H0 , rather it reduces by one
the number of degrees of freedom.

(8)

in order to ﬁnd the temporal evolution of r and R. After ﬁnding the solution
of previous diﬀerential equations, the problem lies in the computation of two
quadratures to obtain θ and ν.
By diﬀerentiating again the ﬁrst equation in (8), combining both to obtain a
second order diﬀerential equation, and changing the variables r and dr/dt and
the time t for two new variables u and v, and a new time s deﬁned by

The Krylov–Bogoliubov-Mitropolski (KBM) Method

The solution of the diﬀerential equation (10) of the perturbed harmonic oscillator
n
can be written as an asymptotic expansion u =
n≥0 ( /n!) un (δ, f ), where
u0 = δ cos f , un (δ, f ) are 2π–periodic functions in f , and the variation of δ and
f with respect to the time is given by

(11)

The KBM method, [6,12], gives an iterative way to ﬁnd the terms An , Bn
and un . Assuming that the order (n − 1) has been solved, we ﬁnd a function Un
that depends on all expressions until order (n − 1). Then, by calling cj (F ) and
sj (F ) respectively the coeﬃcients of cos jf and sin jf in the Fourier expansion of
F (f ), the expressions of An , Bn are An = −s1 (Un )/(2ω), Bn = −c1 (Un )/(2ωδ),
and the function un is given by its Fourier expansion whose coeﬃcients are
c0 (un ) = c0 (Un )/ω 2 , cj (un ) = cj (Un )/ωj , sj (un ) = sj (Un )/ωj , j ≥ 2, with
ωj = ω 2 (1 − j 2 ).
Applying the KBM method to the equation (10) we ﬁnd the variation of δ
and f with respect to the new time s by means of the expressions

Equation (12) shows that δ has a constant value. nf is also a constant since
the values of Kni,j are constant. However, we will not integrate equation (12) to
obtain the relation between f and s, rather, we will obtain a generalized Kepler
equation in the next section. This latter equation will give us a direct relation
between f and t.
Besides we obtain the expressions of u and v. These expressions together
with the change of variables (9), allow us to ﬁnd the expression of R

where KkR and Kkr are functions of constants, and we use the generalized semi–
latus rectum, eccentricity and semi–mayor axis. These expressions are used to
obtain the variables θ and ν and the momenta Θ and N .

Generalized Kepler Equation

The variation of the generalized true anomaly, f , with respect to time, t, is
obtained after considering the deﬁnition of s given by (9) from which we get
nf Θ dt = r2 df,

(15)

in which we substitute r by the expression (14) in terms of f .
Then, we apply a change of variables as in the case of the transformation of
the true anomaly into the eccentric anomaly√in the non–perturbed two body problem p/(1 + e cos f ) = a(1 − e cos E), df = 1 − e2 (1 − e cos E)dE. This change
of variables is usually used in orbital mechanics to transform integrals with powers of (1 + e cos f ) in the denominator into terms with powers of (1 − e cos E)
in the numerator. By doing so, we can integrate these expressions. In our problem, the existence of factors cos nf, sin nf in the numerator of the perturbation
terms implies that, even after applying the change, some terms still have powers
of (1 − e cos E) in the denominator.
A practical way to avoid this formal problem is to apply ﬁrst the change of f
into w deﬁned by w = 1 + e cos f, cos f = (w − 1)/e. By using the properties of
Chebyshev’s polynomials, Tn , Un , we can express each term of (15) as a positive
or negative power of w, multiplied or not by sin f . Then, to integrate (15) we

334

just have to consider integrals of the form wn df, wn sin f df, that can be
easily performed [4].
Finally, we obtain the equation n(t − T ) = E − e sin E + i>0 ( i /i!)Ki (E, f ),
where T represents the value of t when f = E = 0, equation known as the
generalized Kepler’s equation. Note that for orders greater than one, some terms
in f and E are mixed up in this generalized Kepler equation.
