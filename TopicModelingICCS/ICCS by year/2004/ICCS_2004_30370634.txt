Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to present a economic system,
such as the base to estimate the mathematical exactness of the System
Dynamics Method. An interesting point of view is to examine the
reaction of such system to the sinusoidal characteristic of the market
sale of a product and to estimate the mathematical preciseness of the
method solution.

Introduction

System Dynamics is a well known method of modelling, analysing and simulating
dynamic processes occurring in economic and social systems. The world famous
theory and application of Forrester [5, 6] and Coyle [1, 2, 3, 4] as well as and
many other authors are basically concerned with continuous processes, but an
addition of discrete events is also possible [7, 8, 9]. The attention is paid to the
fact that relatively few authors are occupied with estimating the mathematical
exactness of the System Dynamics Method. Naturally, this exactness may only
be estimated for simple systems (the word ”simple” refers to the order of the
diﬀerential equation which was used to model the system).
In this paper one of such systems is presented. It contains: production,
pipeline production, storage and sale. The sinusoidal characteristic of the market
demand is assumed. In Figure 1 the scheme of the system assuming Lukaszewicz’s
symbols [10] is presented with the list of variables and parameters.

In the next section of the paper, we present the results of the simulation of
this model usying System Dynamics method and Professional Dynamo 4.0 for
Windows.

Simulation of the Dynamics of the Production –
Store – Sale System

The Professional Dynamo 4.0 for Windows provides two types of integration:
– Euler method,
– Runge-Kutta method.
In Table 1 some of the errors in the simulations of these two types are presented. The analysis of errors underlines a considerable exactness, which, in turn,
proves the usefulness of the System Dynamics Method, for simulating various
economic systems. Moreover, it is used in real chance systems, when their size
and complexity make it impossible to apply the exact methods. If the Euler’s
method is used, attention should be paid to the exactness of the results with
a proper choice of the simulation step. Consequently, if the Runge-Kutta method
is used, the simulation step is automatically partitioned to obtain a solution for
a given exactness (with deﬁnite parameter REL ERR). Moreover, this includes
longer calculation time.

Conclusion

After modelling and simulation of the production – store – sale system, we have
reached the following conclusions:
a) The System Dynamics Method is a very simple universal method, and, at the
same time, its mathematical exactness is suﬃcient or can even be improved
with more sophisticated methods of integration (like Runge-Kutta method).
b) The conﬁdence for mathematical exactness of the System Dynamics Method
in that paper was consolidated; that fact can help for development both:
– further work for sophisticated tools of simulation complex system,
– further application of the System Dynamics Method.
