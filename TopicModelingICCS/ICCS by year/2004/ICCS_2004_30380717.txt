Abstract. Our goal is to develop the capability for characterizing the
three-dimensional geological structure and mechanical properties of individual sites and complete basins in earthquake-prone regions. Toward
this end we present a framework that integrates in situ ﬁeld testing, observations of earthquake ground motion, and inversion-based modeling.

1

Geotechnical Site Characterization

An important ﬁrst step for forecasting strong ground motion during future earthquakes in seismically-active regions is to characterize the three-dimensional mechanical properties and geological structure of sites and basins within those
regions. Characterizing a site refers to our ability to reconstruct as faithfully as
possible the soil proﬁle in terms of a limited set of material parameters, such
as shear and compressional wave velocities, density, attenuation, and the slow
velocity for poroelastic media.
Geological and geotechnical materials, soil and rock, impact the performance
of the built environment during earthquakes. They play a critical role in the generation of ground motion, and, consequently, on determining the spatial extent
and severity of damage during earthquakes. Yet, they are not well-investigated,
even though they are the most variable and least controlled of all materials in
the built environment. Since soils cannot be accessed easily, their properties can
be inferred only indirectly. Currently, geomaterials are characterized with essentially the same general testing methods that were used 25 years ago. These
methods rely on testing a small number of specimens in the laboratory and conducting a limited number of small-strain ﬁeld tests. There is a critical need to
advance beyond current methods to reduce the level of uncertainty that currently
exists in the estimation of geological and geotechnical material properties.
A variety of techniques for reconstruction of earth properties from noninvasive ﬁeld tests have been pursued, notably within the gas and oil exploration
communities. However, the goals of our work are distinctly diﬀerent, both in
terms of the nature of the problem (e.g. complete material proﬁle reconstruction

vs. estimates of material contrast) and in the models employed (e.g. all elastic
waves vs. just acoustic waves).
Reconstruction of the soil model results in a time-dependent or timeharmonic wave propagation inverse problem. Solution of this inverse problem
represents an enormous challenge from the theoretical, algorithmic, and computational points of view. An added challenge is the lack of a systematic approach
to in situ measurements. Such measurements are often decoupled from the needs
of the computational process, due to cost considerations, equipment limitations,
or the adoption of ad-hoc and simpliﬁed analysis procedures.
With current test equipment, the volume of soil that can be excited from
a single location is somewhat limited because the maximum loads that can be
applied are restricted and the response amplitude decays exponentially with
distance, frequency, amount of soil damping, and slowness of the propagating
waves. The advent of large-scale test equipment makes it possible to apply much
larger loads over a wide range of frequencies, and thus excite a larger volume of
soil from a single location than has been possible till now.
To eﬀectively extract the desired information from the ﬁeld test data, we
need robust, eﬃcient, and scalable forward and inverse three-dimensional wave
propagation solvers. We have developed such methods and ﬁne-tuned them for
the analysis of earthquake ground motion in large basins. Our forward and inverse modeling methods are overviewed in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. Finally,
in Section 4, we present an on-line framework for local site characterization that
integrates steerable ﬁeld experiments with inverse wave propagation.

Forward Elastic Wave Propagation Modeling

Our forward elastic wave propagation simulations are based on wavelengthadaptive mesh algorithms, which overcome many of the obstacles related to
the wide range of length and time scales that characterize wave propagation
problems through heterogeneous media [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. In highly heterogeneous
media such as sedimentary basins, seismic wavelengths vary signiﬁcantly, and
wavelength-adaptive meshes result in a tremendous reduction in the number of
grid points compared to uniform meshes (e.g. a factor of 2000 in the Los Angeles
Basin). Our code includes octree-based trilinear hexahedral elements and local
dense element-based data structures, which permit wave propagation simulations
to substantially greater resolutions than heretofore possible.
We have validated our code using the Southern California Earthquake Center
(SCEC) LA Basin model and an idealized model of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. To illustrate the spatial variation of the 1994 Northridge earthquake
ground motion, Fig. 1 presents snapshots at diﬀerent times of an animation of
the wave propagation through the basin. The left part of the ﬁgure shows a plan
view and cross-section of the basin, as deﬁned by the distribution of shear wave
velocity. The projections of the fault and hypocenter are also shown. The directivity of the ground motion along strike from the epicenter and the concentration
of motion near the fault corners are response patterns of the actual earthquake

ground motion in the southeast portion of the San Fernando Valley (Sherman
Oaks), in the Santa Monica area, and La Cienega, are not. This discrepancy is
due, in part, to the simpliﬁed nature of the source, but also because the current
SCEC model does not yet provide the necessary ﬁdelity.

Inverse Elastic Wave Propagation Modeling

The discrepancy between observations and simulation illustrated in the previous
section underscores the need to invert for basin material properties, either from
records of past earthquakes or from observations of ground motion generated
by seismic testing equipment. The inverse problem is formulated as a nonlinear
optimization problem, with an objective function that represents a norm misﬁt
between observations and predictions, and constraints in the form of the seismic
wave propagation initial-boundary value problem. The inverse wave propagation
problem is signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult to solve than the corresponding forward
problem, because (1) forward solution is just a subproblem of the inverse problem, (2) the inverse problem is often ill-posed despite the well-posedness of the

720

V. Ak¸celik et al.

forward problem, (3) the inverse operator couples the entire time history of the
system’s response and leads to large dense matrices, and (4) the objective function is often highly oscillatory, with basins of attraction that shrink with the
wavelength of the propagating waves, thus entrapping most optimization methods at local minima.
We have developed a scalable, parallel algorithm for the inverse wave propagation problem that addresses these diﬃculties [8]. To treat multiple local minima, we employ multiscale continuation, in which a sequence of initially convex,
but increasingly oscillatory, approximations to the objective function are minimized over a sequence of increasingly ﬁner discretizations of state and parameter
spaces, which keeps the sequence of minimizers within the basin of attraction
of the global minimum. Total variation (TV) regularization is used to address
ill-posedness and preserve sharp material interfaces such as between geological
layers. To overcome the diﬃculties of large, dense, expensive to construct, indefinite Hessians, we combine Gauss-Newton linearization with matrix-free inner
conjugate gradient iterations. These require good preconditioners in the case of
the TV regularization operator, which presents considerable diﬃculties due to its
strong heterogeneity and anisotropy. Our preconditioner is based on the limited
memory BFGS algorithm to approximate curvature information using changes in
directional derivatives, initialized by second order stationary iterations applied
to the TV operator.
Here we provide evidence of the feasibility of this approach for ﬁnely-parameterized models. We illustrate ﬁrst with a two-dimensional sedimentary basin
undergoing antiplane motion. The seismic model under consideration comprises a
portion of the vertical cross-section of the Los Angeles basin in Fig. 1, as shown
at the bottom of the right frame in Fig. 2a, where the trace of a strike-slip
fault and the hypocenter of an idealized source are identiﬁable. In our numerical
experiments, we use waveforms synthesized from the target model on the free

surface as pseudo-observed data. We assume that the source, deﬁned by its rupture velocity and slip function, is known, and invert for the shear wave velocity
distribution of the geological structure. We have assumed that the material is
lossless and that the density distribution is known. Five percent random noise
has been added artiﬁcially to the synthetic seismogram. Fig. 2a shows a sequence
of inverted material models, corresponding to increasingly ﬁner inversion grids.
Inversion was performed with 64 observers distributed uniformly on the free surface. The high ﬁdelity of the results is noteworthy. Fig. 2b compares results for
64 and 16 receivers. As expected, the resolution of the inverted model for 16
receivers is not as great as for 64 receivers, yet it still closely approximates the
target model. The synthetics in Fig. 2b show the velocity at one non-receiver
location for the two models, both for the initial guess and for the inverted solution.
Corresponding results for a three-dimensional simulation of the San Fernando
Valley are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The material in this model is linearly elastic
and lossless, with density and Lam´e parameter λ ﬁxed. We invert for the shear
modulus using a grid of 15×15 receivers placed on the free surface and uniformly
distributed throughout the valley. The source is a point-source double-couple
located at a 16 km depth. Fig. 3 displays sections of the distribution of target
and inverted shear wave velocity. The right panel shows the N-S component of

the target model are captured by the inverted model, and the agreement of the
target and inverted waveforms is excellent, even at the non-receiver locations.
Figure 4 illustrates the diﬀerent levels of the multiscale algorithm. In this ﬁgure
we show 12 GPa isosurfaces of the shear modulus. The similarity between the
ﬁnest-grid inverted model and the target model is evident by comparing the last
two images. Current eﬀorts are aimed at extending the method to incorporate
inversion for attenuation properties and nonlinear constitutive parameters of the
soil, both of which are important for assessing response of geotechnical systems
under strong ground motion.

A Framework for Online Inversion-Based 3D Site
Characterization

The integration of ﬁeld tests with seismic inversion presents some unique challenges and opportunities, both from the computational as well as experimental
point of view. Our goal is to close the loop between experiment and simulation
in the context of characterizing individual sites and basins. Toward this end
we are pursuing an online framework for site characterization that integrates
inversion-based modeling and steerable ﬁeld experiments. The idea is to repeatedly: (1) excite the soil and collect surface and downhole ground motion data
at a particular ﬁeld location, (2) transmit the data back to high-end supercomputing facilities, (3) perform inversion to predict the distribution of material
properties, (4) identify regions of greatest remaining uncertainty in the material
properties, and (5) provide guidance on where the next set of ﬁeld tests should
be conducted.
The ﬁrst key issue will be to turn around the inversion calculations in a time
frame appropriate for the ﬁeld experiments. Getting data to and from the compute nodes will not be a problem; two-way satellite connection will be able to
keep up with the sensor ground motion data that is sent, and the material model

that is received, on a daily basis. On the other hand, the run times needed to
compute the 3D inversions in the previous section (on the order of a day on 512
processors) would be prohibitive in the online context. However, there are several
improvements and simpliﬁcations we can make. First, we will invert for signiﬁcantly smaller regions than the San Fernando Valley example considered above,
typically just a square kilometer surrounding the test site. Second, whereas the
inversions presented above began with homogeneous initial guesses, here we will
incorporate priors based on an oﬄine phase in which records of past earthquakes
are inverted for an initial model of the basin. With the incorporation of a prior,
we can expect faster convergence to the optimum. Third, ongoing improvements
to the Hessian preconditioner are expected to yield a signiﬁcant speedup in iterations. With these improvements, we can expect to comfortably turn around
an inversion overnight on a reasonable number of processors.
The second key issue is the ability to invert the material model for observations associated with multiple excitations generated by the ﬁeld equipment for a
particular location. These multiple sources provide a richer dataset for inversion,
and thus result in better resolution of the reconstructed soil model. However,
this entails a large increase in necessary computational resources, since at each
iteration of the inversion algorithm, a forward model must be solved for each
independent excitation, and several dozen such excitations may be available.
Fortunately, there is considerable coarse granularity available in the algorithm:
all of the forward wave propagation simulations can proceed independently in
parallel, at each inversion iteration. Therefore, by exploiting multiple, possibly
distributed, groups of processors, we can eﬀect inversion for multiple sources
within the same clocktime as a single source—perhaps faster, since the inverse
problem is better conditioned with the more copious available data, and the number of iterations should be fewer. The processor groups can be tightly coupled,
as for example in the PSC AlphaCluster, or else loosely coupled across multiple sites of the NSF NEESGrid/TeraGrid. The inversion algorithm is highly
latency tolerant—the coordination among the multiple forward simulations is
in the form of broadcasts of material model corrections—done only after the
forward (and adjoint) simulations are completed. Thus we can harvest cycles on
processor groups wherever they are available.
The third key issue is the ability to steer the experimental equipment towards
regions of high uncertainty in basin properties. The opportunity for steering
occurs when the inversion is completed, the material model (of the entire basin)
updated to reﬂect the recently acquired information, and the model transmitted
back to the ﬁeld to help direct the next round of ﬁeld tests. Uncertainty in the
estimates of the material parameters, as indicated by their variances, can be
used to steer the equipment towards regions where conducting new tests is most
proﬁtable. Evaluating the variances exactly is intractable for such large-scale
problems, but through the use of improved preconditioners we may be able to
generate suﬃciently good estimates of the important components of the Hessian,
since the misﬁt term is typically of very low rank. The main task is to balance
quality of the estimates against speed in obtaining them, while keeping sight of
the goal of on-line experimental steering.
