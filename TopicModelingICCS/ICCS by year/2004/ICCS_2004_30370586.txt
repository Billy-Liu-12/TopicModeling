Abstract. In this paper we present a-posteriori error estimator for
the mixed formulation of linear parabolic problem, and we use them
in designing an eﬃcient adaptive algorithm. Our space-time discretization consist of lowest order Raviart-Thomas ﬁnite element over graded
meshes, and discontinuous Galerkin method with varying time-steps.

Introduction

A-posteriori error estimates are an essential component in the design of reliable
and eﬃcient adaptive algorithms for the numerical solutions of PDEs. At the
same time, mixed formulations are suitable for certain problems, as they allow
to directly approach certain derivatives of the solution.
In this paper we introduce an a-posteriori error estimation for mixed formulation of the linear parabolic problem obtaining,
u−U

L∞ (0,T ;L2 (Ω))

+ p−P

L2 (0,T ;H −1 (div,Ω))

≤ E(u0 , f, T, Ω; U, P, h, k),

where u is the scalar variable, and p its gradient. Capital letters represent the
numerical approximations obtained with the lowest order Raviart-Thomas ﬁnite
element in space and a variable step discontinuous Galerkin method in time.
The estimator E is computable in terms of: given data u0 , f , Ω, T , computed
solutions U and P, meshsize h and time step k.
As in [4], we obtain the error representation formulas of u−U and p−P from
the residual equations. The evaluation of the residual in the corresponding norms
and the stability properties of the associated dual problem allow the estimations
to be concluded. The scalar error bound is an extension to the mixed formulation
of the results developed in [3]. For the error estimation of p − P we use the
Helmholtz descomposition in L2 (Ω; R2 ), as in [1] and [2] for the stationary case.

where ν is the unit normal vector to ∂Ω.
In the following, (·, ·) denotes the inner product in L2 (Ω) or L2 (Ω; R2 ) and
< ·, · > denotes the duality pairing between the corresponding spaces. We deﬁne
the space H0 (div , Ω) as,
H0 (div , Ω) := q ∈ L2 (Ω; R2 ) : div q ∈ L2 (Ω), < q · ν, v >= 0 ∀v ∈ H 1 (Ω)
and denote by H −1 (div , Ω) its dual space. For the corresponding variational
formulation of this problem we use the bilinear operator B, deﬁned on L2 (Ω) ×
H0 (div , Ω) as,
B(w, q; r, s) = (w, r) + (div q, r) + (div s, w) − (q, s).
Adding the equations (1) and (2) we obtain the following variational problem,
Continuous problem. Find u and p such that
u ∈ H 1 (0, T ; L2 (Ω)),

p ∈ L2 (0, T ; H0 (div , Ω)),

B(ut , p; v, q) = (f, v) ∀(v, q) ∈ L (Ω) × H0 (div , Ω) a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

Discretization

The fully discrete problem combines ﬁnite elements in space with the Galerkin
discontinuous method in time.
n
Let kn denotes the time step at the n-th step and set tn = i=1 ki . Let N be
the total number of time steps, that is, tN = T . To each time step, (tn−1 , tn ] we
associate (Tn , Mn , Xn ), where Tn = {Sn } is a uniformly regular partition of Ω in
triangles. We denote hn a piecewise constant function with hn|S = diam(S) for
all S ∈ Tn , Bn is the set of all interior edges e of Tn ; he stands for the size of e.
The mesh Tn is obtained from Tn−1 by reﬁning/coarsening. Mn ∈ L2 (Ω) is the
usual space of piecewise constant ﬁnite elements over Tn . Finally, Xn ∈ H(div, Ω)
is the lowest order Raviart-Thomas ﬁnite element. Then, we have the problem,
Discrete problem. Given U n−1 ∈ Mn−1 , Pn−1 ∈ Xn−1 , then kn−1 and
Tn−1 are modiﬁed as described in section §5 to get kn and Tn and thereafter
U n ∈ Mn , Pn ∈ Xn computed according to,

Adaptive Algorithm and Numerical Examples

We propose two adaptive strategies based on the former estimates. The goal is
to determine the time steps and the meshes in order to obtain a uniform error
distribution. As usually in parabolic problem we distinguish four kinds of terms
in the a-posteriori estimate: initial error, space discretization error, coarsening
error and time discretization error,
En ≤ E0 + Eh,n + Ec,n + Ek,n .

We also select the parameters Γ0 , Γh , Γk , verifying, Γ0 + Γh + Γk ≤ 1, in a way
that given a total error tolerance tol, the adaptive algorithm tries to select time
steps and meshes verifying for all n,
En ∼ tol,

E0 ∼ Γ0 tol,

Eh,n + Ec,n ∼ Γh tol,

Ek,n ∼ Γk tol.

The algorithm begins with an initial time step k0 . Given θ1 ∈ (0, 1) and θ2 ∈
(0, θ1 ), if Ek,n > Γk tol, then the time step diminishes in a factor δ1 ∈ (0, 1); on
the contrary, if Ek < Γk tol, the time step increases in a factor δ2 > 1. For the
space reﬁnement we use an error equidistribution strategy (see [3]).
We use an implicit adaptive strategy, that is for each time step we start from
the previous step mesh and repeat the process solving-estimating-adapting until
the estimated error being below the tolerance.
In the poster session we will present several examples showing that the proposed method is eﬃcient and reliable. We compare the estimators with the exact
errors, and we obtain an excelent correlation coeﬃcient number (≈ 1). We also
study the adaptation in time and in space.
The numerical experiments have been designed with the ﬁnite element toolbox ALBERT [5], extended with new designed tools for the lowest order RaviartThomas ﬁnite element and the a-posteriori error estimator developed in this
paper.

Conclusions
We obtain a-posteriori error estimators for the mixed formulation of linear
parabolic problem and we use them in designing an eﬃcient adaptive algorithm.
