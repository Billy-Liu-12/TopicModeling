Abstract. In this paper, we considered previously existing multicast routing
algorism and protocol and especially put more attention on CBT routing
protocol to analyze its strength and weakness. As a result, traffic was converged
upon core router because of structural problem of CBT protocol and according
to the converged traffic, there was congestion at the core link, thus it caused
efficiency degrades of the whole routing. Therefore, we proposed a way of
conversion to Anycast Routing method from the method of CBT multicast tree
routing that was suitable for traffic decentralization even though there was high
bandwidth depended on increment of traffic load. In order to support
multimedia service that requires from small to large bandwidth and to consider
multicast routing protocol to improve characteristic of multicast packet’s delay,
CBT/Anycast routing method can be proposed as an alternative plan for
freedom of bandwidth in traffic.

1 Introduction
Multicast protocol classifies network users into specific groups and provides not only
various but characterized services with communicating protocol to individuals,
enterprises, and the government. It becomes a matter of concern and interest for
internet communication.
The CBT (Core Base Tree) method, the representative protocol of the covalent
tree, is one of methods to improve high-speed transmission of multicast packet and
efficiency of communication by decreasing overhead from tree constitution’s overlap.
However, CBT (Core Base Tree) has several problems in structure and they work as
its vulnerability (Core Base Tree) [3], [4].
The first problem of CBT is the phenomenon of transmitter’s traffic concentration
around Core Router. For instance, traffic density and surplus sign around Core router
that are often seen in services like video, Telnet, Ftp, etc. Fig. 1 shows concentration
problem in traffic and Fig. 2 is Poor Core phenomenon.

However, if the core is positioned in an isolated area from transmitter-recipient of
packet and used independently, then it becomes impossible to have right choice and
practice even though it does not require much the high bandwidth and the
maintenance space of routing information. Therefore, ABT (Anycast Based Tree) is
proposed in the paper.
ABT does not limit core in specific position within network but let it actively be
located so that the previously mentioned problems of CBT can be solved. The specific
resolution is to use AIMD (Addictive Increase Multiple Decrease) algorism. The
controlled transmission rate of traffic enables traffic that is concentrated in core
router, to maintain average transmission rate and leads traffic to poor core so it helps
to improve excess use in whole system and performs multicast service in high speed
[6], [7].

2 ABT
The main characteristic of the suggested ABT is its treatment of multicast packet in a
formation like CBT without having core router. In this process, however, it requires
control mechanism that moves traffic to core in the other side when traffic gets
concentrated in core more than threshold.
In multicast routing, the time for traffic to pass the core is called Core round trip
time (crtt), and crtt becomes reset time for a table in a transmitter and a control
parameter.
For increase factor of packet, the transmission time increment of core can be
shown as a / crtt , and if there is increase in transmitter, the formula is like below:

Rin = Rnow +

a
.
crtt

(1)

where, Rin is transmit packet and Rnow is amount of packet in the present core. If
there is decrease of packet to core, the formula becomes like below:

Rin =

Rnow
.
b

where, b is factor for decrease. The increase of transmitted packet and the average
transmitted rate based on decrease can be calculated at the core from a and b . Also,
the transmission rate is calculated according to the size of packet from recipient and
the minimum and maximum rate for transmission can be calculated with increase of
recipient as follows:

Rmax = Rin ⋅
Rmin =

a
⋅n.
crtt

Rmin is minimum rate for transmission of core, Rmax is maximum rate for
transmission of core, and transmission time increase is n . The below formula is for
the average rate for transmission by using minimum and maximum rates for
transmission of core:

Rave =

Rmax + Rmin a b + 1 n

According to Eqn 5, Poor Core phenomenon that becomes the minimum rate for
transmission of core and congestion around core that occurs it becomes the maximum
rate of transmission can be controlled with the average rate of transmission.

Fig. 3 shows retransmission of ACK at the end of each cycle after the multicast
packet (n, crtt, Rave) completed transmission. The formula for the average rate for
transmission in core router is like below. At this time, loss of packet through
retransmission of ACK is p .

3 Simulation and Discussion
To the simulation model, each CBT routing protocol is applied and the numbers of
multicast groups and transmitters are varied. Then the packet process condition of
Core router is measured based on the sized of multicast data packet. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5
show the result of the simulation. The reason for this is that there is formation of

initialization of multicast tree and is frequent Join and Leave of group, thus interval
for packet’s arrival becomes shorter and relatively increase in load of packet occurs as
a result. Fig. 4 shows packet transmission delay of CBT and Fig. 5 shows cuing delay
of core as the system is executed as Anycast routing protocol in CBT routing
protocol.

In this paper, change of routing methods from CBT shared tree routing method that
is stable in relatively low bandwidth to Anycast routing method that is appropriate for
traffic congestion even in high bandwidth depends on load of traffic. In the study,
characteristics of delay according to the size change of multicast data packet when the
system is changed from CBT to Anycast, were observed and evaluated.
