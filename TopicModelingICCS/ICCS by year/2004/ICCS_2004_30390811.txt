Abstract. We give the rate of mean-square convergence for the Euler
scheme for one-dimensional stochastic diﬀerential equations with time
dependent reﬂecting barriers. Applications to stock prices models with
natural boundaries of Bollinger bands type are considered.

Introduction

We consider a market in which ﬂuctuation of stocks prices, and more generally
of some economic goods, is given by a stochastic process S = {St ; t ∈ R+ }
living within the upper- and lower barrier processes F = {Ft ; t ∈ R+ } and
G = {Gt ; t ∈ R+ }, i.e. Gt ≤ St ≤ Ft , t ∈ R+ . Such models appear for instance
if some institutions may want to prevent prices from leaving interval [Gt , Ft ]
and prices may have some natural boundaries. Recently, in [8] the simplest case
of constant boundaries of the form [l, d] was considered. In this case an option
pricing formula was obtained under the assumption that S is a solution of an
appropriate stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE). Models of prices ﬂuctuation
considered in practice by quantitive analysts are much more general: barriers
are stochastic processes depending on the process S. Typical examples of such
natural boundaries are the so-called Bollinger bands F, G deﬁned by
Ft = At + α(

reﬂecting barriers driven by a general semimartingale is proved. In the present

5,7,9,10]).
In the paper no attemps has been made to obtain option pricing formulas
for markets with dynamics of prices given by (1). This question deserves an
independent study.

SDEs with Time Dependent Reﬂecting Barriers

We begin with a deﬁnition of the Skorokhod problem with time dependent reﬂecting barriers.
Deﬁnition 1. Let y, f, g ∈ D(R+ , R) with g ≤ f and g0 ≤ y0 ≤ f0 . We say
that a pair (x, k) ∈ D(R+ , R2 ) is a solution of the Skorokhod problem associated
with y and barriers f, g (and write (x, k) = SP (y, f, g)) if

q ∈ R+ .

Then for every y ∈ D(R+ , R) with g0 ≤ y0 ≤ f0 , there exists a unique solution
(x, k) of the Skorokhod problem associated with y and barriers f, g.
Note that in the case of continuous function y similar deﬁnitions of the
Skorokhod problem were earlier given in [3] and [1]. These papers contain also
results on existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Skorokhod problem in the
case of continuous y and continuous barriers f, g (see e.g. [3, Lemma 4.1]).
The following theorem, where Lipschitz continuity of solutions of the Skorokhod problem is stated will prove to be very useful in Section 3.

Let (Ω, F, (Ft ), P ) be a ﬁltered probability space.
Deﬁnition 2. Let D denote the space of all (Ft ) adapted processes with trajectories in D(R+ , R). We say that an operator H : D → D is Lipschitz if
(i) H(X) ∈ D for any X ∈ D,
(ii) for any X, Y ∈ D and any stopping time τ ,
X τ − = Y τ − implies H(X)τ − = H(Y )τ − ,

Given X ∈ D and ε > 0 set εX = {Xt−ε ; t ∈ R+ } (with the convention that
Xt = X0 for t ∈ [−ε, 0)). In what follows barriers of the form F (εX), G(εX),
where F, G are Lipschitz operators we will call barrier operators with delayed
arguments.
Fix ε > 0. Let W be an (Ft ) adapted Wiener process and let F, G be two
Lipschitz operators such that for any X ∈ D
inf (F (εX)t − G(εX)t ) > 0,

t≤q

q ∈ R+ .

(3)

We will say that a pair (X, K) of (Ft ) adapted processes is a strong solution
of the SDE (1) with barrier operators F (εX), G(εX) with delayed argument if
(X, K) = SP (Y, F (εX), G(εX)), where

Theorem 3. ([11]) Let ε > 0. Assume that σ, b are Lipschitz continuous functions and F, G are Lipschitz operators satisfying (3) with G(X0 )0 ≤ X0 ≤
F (X0 )0 . Then there exists a unique strong solution (X, K) of the SDE (1).
Theorem 4. Let ε > 0 and let σ, b, F, G, X0 satisfy the assumptions of Theorem
3. If
E sup(|F (X0 )t | + |G(X0 )t |)2p < +∞,

then

then for every p ∈ N, q ∈ R+ there exists C > 0 such that
E|Xt − Xs |2p ≤ C(t − s)p
for s ≤ t ≤ q.
Corollary 1. Under assumptions of Theorems 3 and 4 for any q ∈ R+ , δ > 0
there exists C > 0 such that

Proof. Due to Theorem 5 and (5) it is suﬃcient to prove that the respective

In the case of trading bands F has the form:
F (X)t = (1 + α)B(X)t ,

t ∈ R+ .

Hence F posseses properties (i) and (ii) of Deﬁnition 2 and for X, Y ∈ D, q ∈ R+
we have
sup |F (X)t − F (Y )t | ≤ (1 + α) sup |Xt − Yt |,

so F is Lipschitz.

Proof. It follows from (6), Theorem 5 and the fact that in both cases F, G are
