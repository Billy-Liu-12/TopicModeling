Abstract. We propose to put the environment into ﬁnancial markets.
We explain how to do it, and why the ﬁnancial approach is practically
the only one suited for stopping and inverting environmental degradation. We concentrate our attention on deforestation, which is the largest
environmental problem in the third world, and explain how to start the
project and what kind of optimization problems should be solved to ensure the optimal use of environmental funds. In the ﬁnal part we analyze
the dynamical control for bounded processes and awards partially based
on the mean of the underlying value.

1

Introduction

We argue that practical solutions for the environmental degradation are in a
short supply. Most of the increasingly complex models set oﬀ diﬀerent opinions about their applicability. Models should be well speciﬁed. It means that
inputs should be observed or estimated. This requirement is hard to meet in
environmental studies. Thus, the eﬃcient global environmental decision–making
becomes very diﬃcult. Moreover politicians often tend to justify their decisions by inappropriate theories. This situation leads to proliferation of ineﬀective
studies and waste of resources.
We shall propose to apply the market approach to get solutions of some
of the environmental problems. It could result in more transparent transfer of
funds and the involvement of everybody concerned. Also we can expect that the
transparency could stem in an increment of these funds.
We shall focus on the issue of deforestation due to its importance for the
global well–being, and the possibility to assess the number of trees.
This is not a paper about statistics or numbers. We will mention only that
the annual deforestation rate is about 60,000 square miles.
Although the choice of any particular model is, at this stage, only of secondary importance, the primary goal being to start the project, in [4] was chosen
as a dynamical model for the number of trees in a given region a BESQδβ process,

which in ﬁnancial language is 0th dimensional CIR model for interest rates. The
Geometric Brownian Motion can be a candidate for an alternative model, and
we use it in this study.
Our approach is based on a positive involvement of holders of ”good” options
bought or, in the ﬁrst stage, obtained for free. In the case of the forest ”good”
means a kind of Asian call option. We hope that it is clearly understood why
Asian and why call, ”Bad” options are of course put options. We will show that,
in a natural way, three kinds of optimization problems crop up, i.e. an individual
agent problem, a local optimization problem, and aglobal optimization problem.
The ﬁrst one concerns the problem how a holder’s choice of a good option
can possibly contribute to reforestation. The second one is how to choose prices
of ”good” and eventually ”bad” options, to maximize the space mean of the
temporal mean of the ”asset” in given place. The last one is how to distribute
funds into particular projects.
This situation slightly resembles the study of Executive stock options in [1].
However we must work with more diﬃcult to analyze kind of awards based on the temporal mean and also with bounded models that represents more
complications as we shall see in Section 3.
To create a market we propose three following stages of actions: 1) – choose
a place, and give ”good” environmental certiﬁcates (which we call options free of
charges for the habitants of the community); 2) – sell good options; 3) – create
a market with ”good” and ”bad” options.
The last stage can’t be developed without applications of the second one,
and could be the object of further challenging studies.

2.1

Analysis of the Second Stage, Static Approach
The Model before the Financial Intervention

For modeling a number of trees in a given region a 0th dimensional CIR process
was proposed in [4], i.e. a process {X(t) : t ≥ 0} with negative drift (β < 0),
deﬁned by
dX(t) = 2 σX(t)dW (t) + 2βX(t)dt,

X(0) = x0 ≥ 0.

This choice was justiﬁed by a heavy traﬃc approximation of the corresponding Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process as explained in our previous study
which contains solutions of relevant mathematical problems within this model.
Starting from diﬀerent assumptions, (and putting for convenience σ = 1), the
heavy traﬃc approximation leads to the geometric Brownian motion
dX(t) = X(t)dW (t) + βX(t)dt, where X(0) = x0 .
2.2

Financial Intervention. Local Goal

Suppose that given a fund Σ, the bank sells ”good” (a sort of call) options on
the number of trees in a given area, which we want to reforest.

Environment and Financial Markets

789

Let us assume that one option is sold. We will clarify this assumption soon.
While selling good options the bank should choose the optimal (also we will
clarify soon what does it mean) price c, and the strike price k1 , in an award
1
Σ+c
(which we call option) k−k
(X(s)∧k−k1 )+ ds, where k is the maximal capacity
0
1
with k < k1 , and
dX(s) = X(s)dW (s) + BX(s)ds,

X(0) = x.

With the factor A = (Σ + c)/(k − k1 ) the bank will never loose money and
unused funds will go to other projects.
For example we take one year as a time horizon, though a dynamical approach
with several moving horizons could be more appropriate.
Optimal local goal means that the optimal agent’s action assures the maximal
1
value of the functional E 0 (X(s) ∧ k)ds .
In agents optimization problem we shall assume their linear utility. In this
case the number of options sold is irrelevant in both local and agents optimization
goals. Only one comment is needed. This option can be traded and this fact would
eventually cause the concentration of capital in the hands of powerful individuals
with positive eﬀects. Only powerful individuals are able to face timber barons!
In what follows we shall consider exactly one option sold.
2.3

Financial Intervention. Agent’s Approach

We assume that an agent acts in the optimal way, maximizing his or her linear
utility. It means that an agent can modify (if worthy) the original ”asset” into
dX(s) = X(s)dW (s) + BX(s)ds, X(0) = x, where x0 ≤ x ≤ k, B ≥ β.
Assume that the cost of agent’s involvement, if worthy, is equal to
1
c + c1 (x − x0 ) + c2 (B − β) 0 (X(s) ∧ k)p ds,
where c1 is clearly the cost of planting (easy to set) and the cost of protection
can be written as the product of 2 factors: cost of changes in the tendency and
cost of actual state. We set p = 1 for further purposes.
Now agent’s linear utility can be expressed as
1
1
A 0 E(Xs − k1 )+ ds − 0 E(Xs − k)+ ds
1

− c − c1 (x − x0 ) − c2 (B − β) k − 0 E(k − Xs )+ ds .
With given optimal B ∗ and x∗ (for any choice of c and k1 ), we can choose
1
optimal c and k1 to maximize E 0 (Xs ∧ k)+ ds. Since A = (Σ + c)/(k − k1 ), so
the parameter c plays a signiﬁcant role, when solving the problem.
The global goal is to distribute the global environmental fund into particular
projects with objective to get the optimal overall reforestation. Some weights
can be included to stress importance of predetermined environmental goals.
2.4

An Example

As an example we take the area of 100 km2 . Assume that the agent’s gain should
be at least c/3, being c the price of the option as before. In very ﬁrst applications

790

the agent’s investment must be very attractive! The agent’s return could be lower
in the future. We assume B ≤ 0 and chose the following initial data: β = −1,
k = 20, X(0) = 1, σ = 30, c1 = 1, c2 = 0.05, with an additional constraint c ≥ 3.
The optimal solution is: c = 3, k1 = 2, x∗ = 14.5, B ∗ = 0, local goal = 12,
agent s gain = 1.2. Here k, X(0), σ, c, k1 , x∗ , local goal, and agent’s gain are
expressed in millions of dollars.
Using this example and some crude approximations, we conclude that using
our approach the overall deforestation could be stopped with 40 billions of
dollars. This amount seems high. However it could easily be bearable if the
transfer of money from rich toward poor countries would be not unconditional, often supporting corrupt governments and ineﬃcient local bureaucracy, but
instead depend on concrete and predetermined environmental improvements.
Our proposal is that this conditional support should ﬂow through market
mechanisms.
In the ﬁnal stage of good and bad options, these could give forest a kind of
market value, which clearly doesn’t reﬂect its real value.

3

Dynamical Approach

Static Agent’s optimization problem represents only a crude approach to the
reality. Global and local goals are static in their nature (with once ﬁxed horizons)
but agents always act dynamically. In this section we assume (for simplicity) that
options are given for free, so we are in stage 1.
This reminds the problem of executive options by Cadenillas et al in [1] with
main two diﬀerences: ﬁrst – at least one part of the award should depend on the
temporal mean of the underlying process, and second – options can be traded.

3.1

Elementary Models

Let us formulate ﬁrst an elementary model. We shall explain later that this
cannot be possibly the best choice in our modelling. The number of trees in a
given region is represented by
dX(t) = σ(X(t))dW (t) + (u(t) − β)X(t)dt,
where β > 0, and σ = σ(x) is an arbitrary function satisfying only mild conditions ensuring existence and uniqueness of the solution of this stochastic equation
(cf. [7]). Agent’s goal is to ﬁnd
T

T

max E A 0 X(s)ds − c1 0 u2 (s)X(s)ds .
Note that in this formulation there is no local optimization problem.
The Bellman approach (with c1 = 1) leads to the equation

Vx2 (t, x)

− βVx (t, x) + σ 2 (x)Vxx (t, x) = 0,

because for optimal u we get u = Vx (t, x)/2. We look for the solution of the form
V (t, x) = xf (t), V (T, x) = 0, and u = f (t)/2. Now we have to solve equation
f (t) +

f (t)

− β 2 = −A.

Set f (t) = 4H(t) + 2β. We have: H (t) + H 2 (t) = (−A + β 2 )/4. Let H(t) =
ϕ (t)/ϕ(t), ϕ(0) = 1, ϕ (T )/ϕ(T ) = −β/2. Resulting equation for ϕ is
ϕ (t)
β2 − A
=
.
ϕ(t)

This equation has the solution, for any T , only if β 2 ≥ A. If β 2 < A the ”local”
solution is
α sin(t) + (1 − α) cos(t),
and H(t) tends to ∞ in a ﬁnite interval. This means that agents ”push too
much” to obtain inﬁnite gain. Therefore we can formulate the problem for short
horizons only.
Under the condition β 2 > A, the solution for ϕ is αect + (1 − α)e−ct , with
(c−β/2)e−cT
c = β 2 − A/2, α = (c+β/2)e
cT +(c−β/2)e−cT < 0.
−cT

2(c−β/2)e
Finally, f (0) = 4 [ (c+β/2)e
cT +(c−β/2)e−cT − 1]c + 2β , and V (0, x) = xf (0).

This is a very nice explicite solution. However the model is not adequate
because not only we have the natural bound for the number of trees in a given region. Even if not, (considering other environmental problems) the agent’s
action could cause unpredictable payment and no ﬁnancial institution would accept the underlying risk. A similar solution (in terms of x instead of t) can be
obtained while considering the agent’s action until time τ ; the ﬁrst hitting time
of k say, in the case of
dX(t) = X(t)dW (t) + (u(t) − β)X(t)dt.
However what to do after τ (if τ < T ) remains unclear, and the hitting time of
k in the case of optimal ut does not have known distribution so the complete
analysis becomes extremely diﬃcult. Moreover, cost and drift proportional to
X(s) is perhaps not the best choice. The impact of the work implied on the
protection and reforestation seems to be more complicated. The impact is smaller
for small or large values of x. In the latter case there is not much to do and in
the former one much work is to be done to restore the area. On the other hand
the rate of deforestation follows a similar pattern. If x is large or small the rate
of deforestation is smaller. Large x means no big environmental problems.
3.2

Bounded Models

In this section we give an example how one could deal with restriction imposed
in the ﬁnal part of previous section. We propose as the basic (simpliﬁed) model
a stochastic equation
dY (t) = Y (t)(1−Y (t))dW (t)+ 12 Y (t)(1−Y (t))(1−2Y (t))dt, Y (0) = 1/2,
with a bounded solution 0 < Y (t) < 1, given by Y (t) = 1/(e−W (t) +1), for t ≥ 0.

792

W. Szatzschneider, M. Jeanblanc, and T. Kwiatkowska

As a model for the number of trees under continuous deforestation and the
control u we propose the equation
dX(t) = X(t)(1 − X(t))dW (t)+
(δu(t) − β)X(t)(1 − X(t)) + 12 X(t)(1 − X(t))(1 − 2X(t)) dt,
with X(0) = x, where 0 < x < 1. Now deﬁning Z(t) = eβW (t)−β

and the goal is to maximize the expectation of this amount with zˇ playing the
role of the Lagrange multipier, to be speciﬁed later. The second term is written
in a form, which leads to a closed form solution of the problem. We assume
T
that the part of award covers expenses 0 H(X(s))ds. An easy application of
Girsanov’s thorem shows that Z(s)X(s)(1 − X(s))(2X(s) − 1) > −0.1. The term
zˇ0.005T is added to do not have to deal with negative awards. We propose (to
make the analysis easier)
F (X(t)) = ln[(X(T − B))+ ].
Now we are able to impose the ﬁnancial institution constrain that Award ≤ σ
(initial fund). The function H must be speciﬁed. Th function Ln is not the utility
of an agent as it was proposed in [1], which remains linear in our approach, but
stands here for the form of the award. Now

In order to ﬁnd zˇ we have to make use of 2 equalities:
E(Z 2 (t)X(t)(1 − X(t))) = E[Z 2 (t)u1 (X(t))]
and
E(Z(t)X(t)(1 − X(t))(1 − 2X(t))) = E[Z(t)u2 (X(t))].
To be speciﬁc let us ﬁx δ = 1, β = 1/2. These expectations can be expressed
without Z. Using Girsanov’s theorem we have for example
1
E(Z 2 u1 (X(t))) = e 4 t E ∗ (u1 (X(t))),
where under P ∗ law we have

However we are able to get the solution in the explicit form.
A bounded model that can be controled explicitly is of the following form
dX(t) = |X(t)|(1 − X(t))dW (t) + (u(t) − β)(1 − X(t))dt.
This model is bounded analogue of drifted squared Bessel process (CIR) from
Section 2.1. As before β > 0, 0 ≤ X(0) < 1. If u(t) ≥ β for any t ∈ T, then
0 ≤ X(t) ≤ 1 and we can skip | · |. Our goal is to maximize

Setting h(t) = 4H(t) − 2β, we obtain

As before we ask for β 2 > A, and H(t) < 0 for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . This implies that
u(t) = Fx (x, t)/2 = −h(t)/2 > 0. So, F (x, t) = (1 − x)h(t) < 0, for 0 ≤ t < T ,
but for any choice of u(T ) = γ ≥ 0 we can make the award positive because of
the presence of ∆.

Final Comments

< 0.

So how do we reforest? Particularly what kind of trees are useful for the ecosystem in question? The inclusion of this factor could give us more parameters in
our optimization problems.
Many other environmental topics can be treated in a way similar to what
we have proposed. We believe that direct involvement in conservation would
produce much better results than compensations proposed by James et al in [3].
