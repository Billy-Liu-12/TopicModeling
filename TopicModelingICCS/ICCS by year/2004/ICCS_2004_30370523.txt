Abstract. This paper describes a novel approach based on fuzzy logic
technique for smoothing process on the unstructured meshes in 2D. The
proposed method works local on triangulation. Therefore, remeshing does not
require. It is known that other smoothing operations such as laplacian
smoothing , optimization based smoothing, angle based smoothing, and hybrid
smoothing operations work global. That is, in these methods, meshing is
achieved, afterwards remeshing is done for smoothing. Whereas, the goal of
presented method is to find the best fit location of node while meshing is done.
However, remeshing process is avoided.

1 Introduction
The basic element in unstructured mesh generation in 2D is triangle and quadrangle.
Triangulation is known as creating mesh by using triangles[1]. For optimum
triangulation, elements of the created unstructured mesh must be equal size. The often
equilateral triangle or isosceles triangle are used. This process is called as
smoothing[2],[3]. The goal of smoothing is to obtain regular elements in mesh.
However, in the solving domain such as finite element method, the more corrected
results can be achieved.
There are many kinds of smoothing in the literature. These are; laplacian
smoothing [4],[5],[6], optimization based smoothing, hybrid smoothing which is
combining of laplacian and optimization based smoothing,, angle based smoothing,
variations of laplacian smoothing[7], winslow smoothing,..., etc. Although laplacian
smoothing need computational cost less than other methods, invalid elements can be
generated in mesh. On the other hand, while optimization ]based smoothing is more
likely to avoid invalid elements, the computational costs is higher than laplacian
smoothing. Hybrid methods eliminate generating of invalid elements of laplacian
smoothing and is decreased computational cost of optimization based smoothing. But,
mesh quality of hybrid methods is not as good as pure optimization based smoothing.
Angle based smoothing provides good mesh quality, but it needs computational cost
less than optimization based smoothing.
The common property of all methods is the working as global smoothing. That is,
firstly mesh is created and then remeshing is done for smoothing. This situation
causes more time and more computational cost.
In this study, while creating a mesh, the smoothed mesh is produced in 2D. So,
remeshing process does not need. Fuzzy logic technique based a method is applied to

smoothing process. It has known that, fuzzy logic technique has used firstly by [8].
First application areas are control applications. And then, different areas are applied
to such as speech and pattern recognition, image processing,..., etc. Applications
about computer graphics are curve modeling [9], curve smoothing and
blending[10],...,etc.
The proposed method works more effective and more speed according to
aforementioned methods. Due to the fact that fuzzy logic technique is used, the
method does not need more computational cost. Also, quality of mesh according to
discrete points on the boundary curve is attractivable. The only effected factor of
mesh quality is the size of triangle which is dependent on distance of discrete points
and angle of discrete points. Presented method is avoided invalid elements which is
drawback of laplacian smoothing method. Due to the fact that smoothed mesh process
is done and as possible as equilateral triangle or isosceles triangle is used, the method
has some advantages. Method is detailed in section two and three.
The organization of paper is as follows; section two describes a presented method
which is the based on fuzzy logic. In Section 3, fuzzy membership functions, rule
base table and a simple application are given. At the finally conclusion is offered.

2 Fuzzy Logic Based Smoothing
In this section, fuzzy based smoothing method (FBSM) is described. The basis of
presented method is to create equilateral triangle or isosceles triangle. The problem
we have interested is to generate smoothed triangulation in 2D. The goal is to form
equilateral triangle or isosceles triangle as possible as. It is known that, a good
triangulation algorithm should be provided following criteria [11] ;
− The proposed must be general. That is, it must be independent on positions of
triangles.
− After smoothing process has finished, unsmoothed element should not be remain
of.
− It must be effective as computational cost and time requirements
− It must be easy-to-implement.
The presenting method provides above conditions. In the following section, the
application method is gives detailed.
2.1 Discretisation of Boundary Curve
For this process, geometric support construction method is used. The set of polygonal
segments of boundary curve is located in the any list. And then, the construction of
the polygonal support is such that the distance any segment and portion of the curve it
represent must be bounded. Hence, refinement of curve will be more important and
correct in the any highly curved regions on the boundary curve.
Let be a distance between a point and the supporting edge, and let b be the length
of the edge. If ration of a/b is less than ε we will determine, the segment we have
selected is correct or wrong. If it is wrong, then segment is subdivided into sub-

segments, each of them being analyzed recursively. As a result, we can make it
geometric support. The ration a/b is user-defined.

2.2 Locating of First Triangle
The presenting method is similar to advancing front in way of starting process. So,
first triangle is located between two nodes selected randomly from list.

distances d1 and d2.

2.3 Fuzzy Smoothed Triangulation Method in 2D
Let points P0,P2,P3,P4 be discrete points and point P1 be a vertex of first triangle.
Firstly, triangle P0P1P2 is located as shown figure 3.a. Afterwards, the operation that
will be done is that triangles are to produce by selecting node position in way of
interior of closed region in unclockwise direction. For this process, the following
steps are applied;
Step 1.
The first triangle is that nodes are P0P1P2. The purpose is to generate a node in such a
way that, based edge of triangle is P2P3 and such that triangle to be created is
equilateral or isosceles triangle. Let us draw a line dividing into two equal segment
the angle α. The goal is to find the best location on the line to be drawn form point P2.
It must be found so point that, it will be proportional to distances d1 and d2. However,

526

triangle to be created will be equilateral or isosceles triangle. Firstly, selection of Py
seems to be reasonable at distance of d1 figure 4.b). The dark line depicts edges of a
new triangle.

b. Triangle producing by connecting P2P4.

In this way, triangle to be produced is the isosceles at the worst case. But, distance d1
is not proportional d3. Therefore, unsmoothed triangles will occur when triangulation
process is proceeded. To avoid this situation, distances d3 can be selected as half of
summation of d1 and d2(equation1).

d3=(d1+d2)/2
Also, a different case may be position of P4 (figure 5.b).At this case, instead of
finding a new Py, directly triangulation is done.
In this case, triangle P2P3P4 is produced by connecting P2P4.
When the list has proceeded, same situation may appear while inner points are
computed. Therefore, the position of P1P2P3 is important.
At this case, triangulation is done without computing a new point. The vertex of
new triangle to be created is P1P2P3. (Fig. 6.b8).

Noticed that, the basic parameters in the triangulation process are angle α,β and
distances d1, d2. Therefore, a new method that will be developed by using angles α

and β, distances d1 and d2 will provide fast and smoothing. For this process, fuzzy
logic based a method is proposed in section3.
The following steps are shown the proposed method according to angles of α and
β.
1. For α<90; triangulation is performed without finding a new point(figure 7.a)
2. For 90= α <180; It is important the value of angle β.
a. For β <=90; two triangle is produced. The one of them is triangle P1P2 and
other is P2P3P4 (figure 7.b)
b. For β >90; A new point is computed by means of fuzzy logic technique. If it is
noticed to figure 11, the position of P4 is not so important. The positions of P4 are
shown as P4’,P4’’,P4’’’.
Another situations of node positions may be find out similarly.

3 Membership Functions and Rule Base Table
In this section, the membership functions and rule base table for fuzzy logic technique
are given. Angle α and β and distances d1 and d2 are used for optimal triangulation.
Angles α and β change in the interval [90,360] according to boundary of object. Also,
distances d1 and d2 can change random according to discretisation of boundary.
Therefore, proportional of them is used (equation 2).
k= d1/d2, for d1>d2
k= d2/d1, for d1>d1
(2)
If it is noticed to figure 9, the constant k can seem as if it were changed in the large
interval. Whereas, due to the fact that almost equal discretization is made, the
changing of k will be in certain interval.

At this way, the tracing boundary and continuity of derivative would be provided. In
this paper, the changing of k will be considered as [0.01,3]. At the other words, for
d1>d2, d1 will be three times of d2. It is known that, firstly, the determination of
membership functions and rule base table is required for fuzzy logic technique.
Angles α and β and constant k are used as inputs of fuzzy logic. Figure 10 shows
input membership functions.
Some outlines on developing the membership function for fuzzy sets are listed as
follows;
1. Membership function as a rational function of polynominals,
2. Membership function as a model for human concepts,
3. Heuristically based membership functions,
4. Membership functions based on statistics or probability density functions [12].
In this paper, we concern with human concept based membership function.
Figure 11 shows output parameters of fuzzy logic. These are distance d3 and angle of
γ.
Figure 12 depicts output membership function.

The first step of proposed method is to locate first triangle. For this process, the first
triangle is constructed as equilateral triangle. The next step is to compute angles α, β
and distances d1, d2 These values are computed as α=98.42° ,β=171.9° ,d1= 4.89 and
d2=5.83.
γ and ky values are computed by means of α=98.42° ve β=171.9° ve d1= 4.89 ve
d2=5.83, which is inputs of fuzzy logic technique. These values are γ=53.1 and
ky=0.736 and d3=0.735*5.83=4.29. Figure 14 depicts position of Py.
The method is iterated according to object boundary. Figure 15.a shows unsmoothed

4 Conclusion
In this study, a novel method based on fuzzy logic technique for smoothing in 2D is
proposed. The use of fuzzy logic technique has provided only remeshing process for
smoothing. Therefore, the proposed method is differ from other method in the
literature. Due to the fact that smoothing process is achieved, remeshing process
doesn’t require. So, computational cost is decreased.
The proposed method has a little time requirements for fuzzy computation. This
time is very little. In the proposed method, the changing of angle is not considered.
As future work, the proposed method will be tried to be applied 3D object.
