Abstract. Generalized functions occur in many practical applications
as source terms in partial diﬀerential equations. Typical examples are
point loads and dipoles as source terms for electrostatic potentials. For
analyzing the accuracy of such computations, standard techniques cannot
be used, since they rely on global smoothness. At the singularity, the
solution tends to inﬁnity and therefore standard error norms will not
even converge.
In this article we will demonstrate that these diﬃculties can be overcome by using other metrics to measure accuracy and convergence of
the numerical solution. Only minor modiﬁcations to the discretization
and solver are necessary to obtain the same asymptotic accuracy and
eﬃciency as for regular and smooth solutions. In particular, no adaptive
reﬁnement is necessary and it is also unnecessary to use techniques which
make use of the analytic knowledge of the singularity. Our method relies
simply on a mesh-size dependent representation of the singular sources
constructed by appropriate smoothing. It can be proved that the pointwise accuracy is of the same order as in the regular case. The error coeﬃcient depends on the location and will deteriorate when approaching
the singularity where the error estimate breaks down. Our approach is
therefore useful for accurately computing the global solution, except in a
small neighborhood of the singular points. It is also possible to integrate
these techniques into a multigrid solver exploiting additional techniques
for improving the accuracy, such as Richardson and τ -Extrapolation.

Introduction

Typical error estimates for the numerical solution of boundary value problems depend on the smoothness of the true solution which is not given in many practical
applications. Reasons for such singular solutions can for example be reentrant
corners, discontinuous coeﬃcients, singular functions in the boundary conditions
or source terms with singularities. In this article we consider the last case. As
application we choose for simplicity electrostatic potentials of point loads, physically modeled by the Maxwell equations in the vacuum (cf. [1]). The method

is extensible to more general situations, but the basic idea of the method is presented here in terms of this simple example. It leads to the Poisson equation
with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the unit cube Ω = [0, 1]3 ⊂ IR3
−∆u = f in Ω
,
u = g on ∂Ω

(1)

where ∆ is the Laplace operator, ∂Ω denotes the boundary of Ω and g is a
smooth function. The source term f contains one or more singularities, because
a point load is modeled by the Dirac δ-function. As an extension we will consider
sources containing dipoles and quadrupoles. A dipole can formally introduced as
a directional derivative of a point load, a quadrupole as a directional derivative
of a dipole. So we have to study the Dirac δ-function and its derivatives in order
to solve problem (1). Note that the Dirac δ-function is not a function in the
common sense (cf. [2]). To be able to deal with it the concept of a function is
extended to the concept of a distribution or generalized function (cf. [3]).
For the discretization of (1) we use ﬁnite diﬀerences on equidistant grids with
mesh size h = N1 . The discrete Laplace operator is given by the usual 7-point
stencil (cf. [4], p.71).
The question now is how to discretize the right hand side f containing the
singularity. f is equal to zero on every point in Ω except at the singularity where
it is ∞. If we assume that the singularity is not located at a grid point, simply
set fh ≡ 0 and then try to solve the above problem without any modiﬁcations
and a standard solver, we would get poor results. On the one hand, standard
error norms near the singularity will not converge, because the solution at the
singularity is unbounded, and on the other hand the accuracy is destroyed in the
whole domain by the singularity. This phenomenon is called pollution eﬀect.
In section 2 we present the Zenger Correction Method to overcome the
pollution eﬀect. The idea is to represent the singular generalized components
of f by grid-adapted B-Splines. Extending results from [5] we can show that
the pollution eﬀect can be eliminated leading to errors of the same quality and
convergence rate as for smooth problems. Its great advantage is that we do not
need to know the exact singular component of the solution of the problem to
approximate the singularity. Therefore it can be used for a variety of problems.
In section 3 the core theorems for the error estimates of the discretization
error for the Poisson equation in the unit cube are presented and the proof of
the main result is outlined.
In section 4 we further improve the accuracy of the numerical solution by
using extrapolation. Two extrapolation methods, namely Richardson extrapolation and τ -extrapolation are brieﬂy described in combination with the Zenger
Correction.
In the 5th section the experimental results for the numerical solution of the
Poisson equation with Zenger Correction are summarized.

Singular Source Terms in Poisson’s Equation

The Zenger Correction Method uses the following generalized functions (cf. [2])
in order to approximate the physical singularities contained in the right hand
side f of equation (1).
Deﬁnition 1 (Generalized functions Hi ). Let H0 : IR → IR be the Heaviside-function

The family of functions Hi enables us to represent arbitrary physical multipoles. For example H1 corresponds to the Dirac δ-function, resp. a point load.
Remember that the directional derivative of a point load was deﬁned as a special
dipole. For higher dimensions we use tensor products of these functions. For the
two multi indices x0 = (x0,1 , x0,2 , . . . , x0,n ) ∈ IRn that indicates the location of
the singularity and a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) ∈ ZZ n that speciﬁes the functions Hi we
use the notation
a
Hx
(x) =

n

Hai (xi − x0,i ) .

(4)

i=1

The idea of the Zenger Correction Method is now to integrate the right hand
side f analytically a number of times, until the result is a product of smooth
functions Hi with i < 0. Then we diﬀerentiate this function numerically as
often as we had integrated it. This results in a approximation to the singularity which becomes more accurate with smaller mesh size h. For the numerical
diﬀerentiation we use ﬁnite diﬀerences with the notation
δ i = δxi11 ◦ δxi22 ◦ · · · ◦ δxinn ,

(5)

for the multi index i ∈ ZZ n that indicates how often we diﬀerentiate in each
direction. Dependent on the number of integrations resp. diﬀerentiation steps n
we call that procedure the Zenger Correction of n-th order. In general for
even n with k − n < 0 we have

Error Estimates

In this section we prove that if the singularity in the source term is replaced
by the above approximation, we obtain an O(h2 ) discretization error as in the
smooth case, except in a small area near the singularity.
Deﬁnition 2 (H-bounded). A family of functions uh (x) is called h-bounded
on the domain Ω ⊂ IRn , if there exists a real valued, continuous function r(x)
on Ω which is not necessarily bounded on Ω, so that for every x ∈ Ω there exists
a number h0 > 0 with |uh (x)| ≤ r(x) for all h = N1 < h0 , N ∈ IN, x ∈ Ωh . If
r(x) is bounded on Ω, uh (x) is called strictly h-bounded (cf. [7], p.6).
A h-bounded family of grid functions uh may be unbounded on Ω for h → 0,
but because of the continuity of r be bounded for all h > 0 on every compact
subset of Ω.
Theorem 1. Let the solution of ∆h uh = fh in Ωh be bounded on Ω h . If δ 2i fh
is h-bounded on Ω and for all il , ml with 0 ≤ il ≤ ml for 0 < l ≤ n, then δ 2m uh
is h-bounded on Ω.
The proof of this theorem is found in [8] for the 2D case and will be generalized
to 3D in a forthcoming paper.
Now we are prepared for the central theorem.
Theorem 2. Let u∗ be the (weak) solution of the boundary value problem

∆u = Hx
0
,
u=0
on ∂Ω

(7)

a
where Hx
(x) is a singularity located in x0 ∈ Ω = [0, 1]n . n ∈ {2, 3} is the
0
dimension of the problem. Let u∗h the solution of

∆h uh = fh in Ωh
,
uh = 0 on ∂Ωh

(8)

a−2m
(x), and where m is chosen componentwise such that
where fh = δ 2m Hx
0
a−2m
2ml > al for 1 ≤ l ≤ n. By deﬁnition it follows that Hx
are continuous
functions. Then:

u∗h = u∗ + h2 r
where r is h-bounded on Ω\{x0 }.
The proof can be found in [5], pp.15 and can be extended to the 3D case.
The advantages of the Zenger Correction Method are that no modiﬁcation of
the grid or the solver is necessary. Furthermore the number of points that have
to be corrected is ﬁxed and does not depend on the mesh size h. The analytic
solution is not needed to construct the correction.

414

H. Koestler and U. Ruede

Note that the Zenger Correction Method eliminates the pollution eﬀect. This
results in a (pointwise) O(h2 ) accuracy at any ﬁxed distance from the singular
point. However, the method cannot provide locally good accuracy. This is impossible since the true solution tends to inﬁnity where the singularity is located.

4

Extrapolation

In this section we present two extrapolation methods in order to improve the
discretization error from O(h2 ) to O(h4 ).
4.1

Richardson Extrapolation

Richardson Extrapolation can be used if there exist asymptotic expansions of
the discretization error (cf. [9]). In this case the solutions of diﬀerent mesh sizes
can be combined to eliminate the lower order terms. For our problem we use the
mesh sizes h und H = 2h. In order to get the higher accuracy on the coarse grid
we change the values there by
u∗H =

4 H ∗ 1 ∗
I u − u ,
3 h h 3 H

(9)

where IhH is an injection operator. The existence of such asymptotic expansions
can be proved even in the case of singularities by extension of Theorem 2.
4.2

τ -Extrapolation

τ -Extrapolation is a multigrid speciﬁc technique that in contrast to Richardson
extrapolation works only on a single grid. It is based on the principle of defect correction and has been ﬁrst mentioned by Brandt (cf. [10], see also
Hackbusch [11], pp.278).
In the CS(correction scheme)-Multigrid algorithm two diﬀerent iterations
are used alternately, the smoother and the coarse grid correction (cf. [4]). These
two iterations have a common ﬁxed point described by f h − Ah uh = 0 (cf.
[5], p. 17f). The smoother converges fast for certain (usually the high frequency)
solution components, but converges only slowly for the remaining (low frequency)
modes. The coarse grid correction behaves vice versa. If these complementary
properties are combined the typical multigrid eﬃciency is obtained.
Now we follow the idea of double discretization, i.e. in the coarse grid
correction process higher order discretizations are used. Using a correction of
the form
(k+1)

uh

(k)

(k)

= uh + eh

,

(10)

(k)

where eh is computed as a coarse grid correction

would lead to a standard multigrid method. τ -extrapolation consists in using a
linear combination of ﬁne and coarse grid residual to construct an extrapolated
correction

It can be shown that this modiﬁcation of the coarse grid correction leads to
a numerical error of order O(h4 ) (cf. [12]). The modiﬁed coarse grid correction is
only applied on the ﬁnest grid once per V-cycle. Additionally we have to take care
when choosing the restriction and the interpolation operators. Normally trilinear
h
interpolation for IH
, full weighting for IhH and injection for IhH is used, but this
can vary from problem to problem. One has also to pay attention not do do
too many post smoothing steps, because this can destroy the higher accuracy.
For the Poisson equation with singular source term we have to discretize the
right hand side on each grid due to the fact that the restriction of the B-spline
cannot approximate the right hand side well enough on the coarse grid. A concise
analysis of the τ -extrapolation is e.g. found in [12].

Experimental Results for a Point Load in 3D

For the experiments we use CS-Multigrid as solver, e.g CS(2, 2, 15) means that
we do 2 presmoothing and 2 postsmoothing steps and a maximum of 15 Vcycles (cf. [13]). The singularity is located at x0 = (0.26, 0.26, 0.26)T in the
domain Ω = [0, 1]3 . To evaluate the accuracy away from the singularity we will
consider Ω \ R, where R = [0.125, 0.375]3 is a ﬁxed neighbourhood of x0 .
The analytical solution of the Poisson equation in 3D with a point load as
source term is given by

The boundary value problem with Zenger Correction of 4th order is described
by

where g(x) = sin(xπ) sin(yπ) sinh( 2zπ). Table 1 lists the numerical results.
The ﬁrst column shows the mesh size h, the second the maximum norm of the
discretization error, then follow the L1 resp. L2 norms in the whole domain Ω
and in the domain Ω\R. The small numbers between the rows of the table show
the numerical convergence rates α which are for a point p ∈ Ω computed by
α = (ln |u∗ (p) − uh (p)| − ln |u∗ (p) − uh/2 (p)|)/(ln 2)
and analogous for the norms in the other columns.
