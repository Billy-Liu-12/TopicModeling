Abstract. Ribosomal frameshifts in the –1 direction are used frequently by
RNA viruses to synthesize a single fusion protein from two or more
overlapping open reading frames. The slippery heptamer sequence XXX YYY
Z is the best recognized of the signals that promote –1 frameshifting. We have
developed an algorithm that predicts plausible –1 frameshift signals in long
DNA sequences. Our algorithm is implemented in a working program called
FSFinder (Frameshift Signal Finder). We tested FSFinder on 72 genomic
sequences from a number of organisms and found that FSFinder predicts –1
frameshift signals efficiently and with greater sensitivity and selectivity than
existing approaches. Sensitivity is improved by considering all potentially
relevant components of frameshift signals, and selectivity is increased by
focusing on overlapping regions of open reading frames and by prioritizing
candidate frameshift signals. FSFinder is useful for analyzing –1 frameshift
signals as well as discovering unknown genes.

1 Introduction
Translation is the mechanism of protein synthesis in which RNA messages are
transformed into the amino acid sequences of proteins. Two kinds of errors can alter
the reading frame during translational elongation. One is spontaneous error that
-5
occurs at a frequency of less than 5 × 10 per codon in all species. The other is nonstandard error (also called programmed translational frameshift) that occurs in some
genes with a frequency close to 100% [1, 2].
Programmed frameshift occurs in genes of organisms ranging from bacteria to
lower eukaryotes, as well as in animal and plant viruses. The analysis of programmed
frameshift is important because it plays a significant role in viral particle
morphogenesis, and in the genetic control of alternative enzymatic activities [2]. In
this process the ribosome shifts a reading frame by one or a few nucleotides at a
specific site in a messenger RNA. The most common of these events requires the
ribosome to shift to a codon that overlaps a codon in the existing frame. The shift of a
single step backwards in effect reassigns a single nucleotide (-1 frameshift), whereas a
slip forwards skips a single nucleotide (+1 frameshift) [3]. The most common type of
frameshift is a -1 shift. The most common elements causing eukaryotic frameshifts
consist of a slippery site that promotes frameshifting mechanically, and a stimulatory
structure that probably induces the ribosome to pause [4]. The slippery site consists of

a heptameric sequence of the form X-XXY-YYZ (in the incoming 0-frame), where X,
Y and Z can be the same nucleotide [4]. The downstream stimulatory structure is
usually a pseudoknot in which certain bases in a loop pair with complementary bases
outside the loop, or it is a simple stem-loop. The slippery heptamer is separated from
the stimulatory structure by a short sequence of 5 to 9 nucleotides, the so-called
spacer [5, 6]. The length of the spacer is known to influence the probability of
frameshifting. Typically viral frameshifts produce fusion proteins in which the aminoand carboxy-terminal domains are encoded by overlapping open reading frames [7],
as shown in Fig. 1.
Many existing approaches to identifying frameshift signals either depend on
comparing DNA sequences with protein sequences in databases [11, 12], or focus on
detecting experimental errors [13]. We have developed a set of algorithms that
consider both downstream pseudoknots and simple stem-loops as downstream
stimulatory structures in the overlaps between open reading frames. We have
implemented these algorithms in a program called FSFinder (Frameshift Signal
Finder).

frames: slippery sequence, spacer, and pseudoknot (or stem-loop). When a frameshift takes
place, protein synthesis terminates at C rather than at B

2 Computational Model
2.1 Components of Frameshift Signals
We extended the computational model for –1 frameshift signals of Hammell et al. [7]
to improve its sensitivity and selectivity. Sequences of 3 codons (9 nucleotides) in a
genomic sequence are first examined for possible slippery sequences X XXY YYZ.
In X XXY YYZ, X and Z can be any nucleotide, and Y can be A or U (in Hammell’s
model, Z is either A, U, or C). If a slippery sequence is identified, FSFinder searches
for a downstream structure by sliding along the spacer from one to 11 nucleotides.
Fig. 2 (A) shows a programmed –1 frameshift signal with a pseudoknot as stimulatory
structure. The pseudoknot is of the H-type, in which stem 1 has 13 base pairs, stem 2
has 6 base pairs, and both loops of the pseudoknot have 6 nucleotides. The first 4
base pairs of stem 1 must include at least 2 G-C pairs.
Some programmed –1 frameshift signals have a simple stem-loop as stimulatory
structure. As explained in Fig. 2 (B), we examine the nucleotides in both directions
from every pivot nucleotide for possible base pairing. The pivot nucleotide can be
either included or excluded in the base pairing.

pairing

2.2 Algorithms for Predicting Frameshift Signals
Algorithms 1 and 2 search for stem-loops and canonical base pairs, respectively. If a
stem-loop crosses other stem-loops, they are considered to form a pseudoknot.
Algorithm 3 finds an overlapping region of open reading frames (ORF). An
overlapping region of ORFs is identified by first finding pairs of stop codons in
frames –1 and 0. If the second stop codon of in frame –1 is to the left to the fist stop
codon in frame 0, an overlapping region of the two frames is found. Overlapping
frames with the largest ORF (light yellow) have the highest probability of containing
frameshift signals, and overlapping frames with the second largest ORF (sky blue)
have the second highest probability of having frameshift signals (see Fig. 3).

2.3 Implementation
FSFinder was implemented in Microsoft C#. It provides graphical views of -1, 0, and
+1 frames, like DNA Strider [8]. The three frames (-1, 0 and +1 frames) are shown in
the left upper window of Fig. 3. If a user specifies a region for detailed examination
by the drag and drop operation in the left upper window, the specified region is
enlarged in the lower left window. The right window displays the positions of start
and stop codons, slippery sequences, pseudoknots and stem-loops found in the frames
in the left window. Users can change the stem and loop sizes of a stem-loop or
pseudoknot. They can also alternate frames to find frameshift signals in different
overlapping frames. (see Fig. 4).

3 Results and Discussion
FSFinder was tested on 71 organisms with known programmed -1 frameshift
mutations obtained from the databases PseudoBase [9] and RECODE [10].
PseudoBase contains 20 eukaryotic viruses and RECODE has 65 prokaryotes,

Computational Identification of –1 Frameshift Signals

eukaryotic viruses, bacteriophages, eukaryotic transposable elements and bacterial
insertion sequences. The two databases share 14 frameshifts. Each of these organisms
and elements has one or two authentic programmed -1 frameshift sites.
Hammell et al. [7] have attempted to identify frameshift signals in prokaryotic and
eukaryotic DNA sequences [7], but the sensitivity of their approach is low. It misses
many frameshift signals because it only considers pseudoknots as downstream
stimulatory structures, the definition of pseudoknots is too restricting, and X XXY
YYG is not considered a slippery sequence. For example, their approach does not
locate the frameshift signals in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), because loops 1 and 2 of
the pseudoknots involved are larger than their approach permits. On the other hand,
the selectivity of the computational model of Bekaert et al. [5] is low because it
predicts too many false positives. Other computational models can identify potential
frameshift signals only when they are given reference protein sequences along with
DNA sequences [11, 12].
FSFinder identifies more frameshift signals than the approach of Hammell et al.
because both pseudoknots and simple stem-loops are considered as downstream
secondary structures and because conditions for slippery motifs and pseudoknots are
relaxed. On the other hand, FSFinder finds less potential frameshift signals than the
approach of Bekaert et al. because it searches for frameshift signals only in the
overlapping regions of open reading frames, and prioritizes candidate frameshift
signals.
A total of 26 frameshift signals in RECODE have simple stem-loops as downstream
secondary structures, but 5 of these were excluded because PseudoBase assigns them
different stimulatory structures. Seventeen of the remaining 21 frameshift signals
were detected by FSFinder while 4 could not be found because their slippery
sequences do not conform to the motif X XXY YYZ. It turns out that many frameshift
signals have the slippery motif X XXY YYG. FSFinder identified 13 such sequences,
and these can be classified into two types: A AAA AAG and G GGA AAG. The
frameshift signals of RSV were also detected.

Searching for frameshift signals in the overlapping region of ORFs is effective in
predicting strong frameshift signal candidates. For example, a total of 157 potential
frameshift signals were found in the sequences of the test cases in PseudoBase. Only
33 of these were in overlapping ORFs, and 19 of 33 proved to be the only genuine
frameshift signals. FSFinder also identifies frameshift signals in alternative frames.
For example, simian type D virus 1 has two slippery sequences G GGA AAC and A
AAU UUU in different frames at positions 2058 and 2585, respectively. FSFinder
detects two different signals in each of 6 organisms in RECODE: human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type 2, mouse mammary tumor virus, simian type D virus 1,
simian retrovirus type 2, simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, and visna virus.
There was only one alternative signal (in mouse mammary tumor virus) that could not
be identified as it has a different motif (G GAU UUA). Table 2 summarizes the
predicted frameshift signals in PseudoBase.

4 Conclusion
Identifying programmed -1 frameshifts is difficult because they are not uniform.
However it is very important to achieve this identification in order to fully understand
the underlying mechanisms and to discover new genes. Existing computational
models predict too many false positives, or need reference protein sequences together
with DNA sequence data from similar organisms.

We have developed an algorithm and a program called FSFinder for predicting
plausible –1 frameshift signals in long DNA sequences. FSFinder was tested on 71
genomic sequences from different organisms and it predicted –1 frameshift signals
more sensitively and selectivity than existing approaches. The procedure increases
sensitivity by considering all potentially relevant components, and has increased
selectivity because it focuses on the overlapping regions of open reading frames and
prioritizes candidate signals. We believe FSFinder will be useful for analyzing –1
frameshift signals as well as for discovering novel genes.
