Abstract. In the basic routing scheme of the mobile IP, the packets sent by the
correspondent node(CN) are delevered to the mobile node(MN) via MN’s home
network which causes the triangle routing problem. To solve this problem, the
route optimization(RO) scheme for mobile IPv6 has been defined by the
mobileip working group in IETF. The return routability(RR) is devised in the
mobile IPv6 to provide the authentication capability between CN and MN.
However, it is inherently weak in the security capability the message exchange
procedure is relatively simple. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
scheme based on AAA infrastructure while support RO. We represent the
performance analysis results depending on the traffic pattern and the terminal
movement speed. Our proposed scheme saves the cost up in compared to 20
percent to RR.

1 Introduction
This paper describes the authentication scheme for a mobile node to perform the RO
with secure manner after entering to new subnet and completing the Home
Registration. To eliminate the routing delay from triangle routing, the RO enabling
direct routing should be performed. However, the various attacks such as DoS, DDoS
and MITM can be carried out by an attacker with a little effort which may result in
packets to be intercepted and rerouted to the attacker. Thus, the security function
should be added to the RO. The mobileip working group has defined the RR as an
authentication scheme for making RO secure. Focusing on the operation and message
exchange overheads, the RR procedure is relatively simple but not able to provide
strong security function. This paper proposes an integrated mechanism with AAA for
authentication and the RO to CN and shows the results of performance analysis
relative to the RR in terms of the cost. The traffic and mobility property where the
MN moves with the mean rate of movement and receives packets with mean rate of
length for a session are assumed. We have verified the effectiveness of the cost using
our proposed model that shows the cost reduction up to 20 percent.

2 AAA Authentication Model and Entities
Fig.1 shows the communication model to exchange the session key between MN and
attendant and to register the current location of the MN to its home agent(HA) based
on AAA(Diameter) infrastructure[1],[2].
The attendant is the first entity the MN encounters when it moves into a subnet and it
take the policy to pass, drop and block the incoming and outgoing packets using preconfigured parameters. When the authentication from the AAA server is successful,
the attendant acquires the session key from it to make the wireless link between MN
and attendant secure and exchanges packets with MN. When the MN is about to carry
out the RO after completing the home registration without session drop, V_AAA as a
AAA(Diameter) server in visited link identifies the home subnetwork of CN by the
address of CN. It them sends the authentication/binding key request message to the
home AAA server of CN to verify the CN and perform the RO with CN in secure
manner. H_AAA carries out the authentication using information of the MN(NAI of
MN[4], Message Authenticator, Home Address of MN, Address of CN, etc) and
returns the reply message to V_AAA.

3 An Authentication Architecture for Route Optimization
3.1 Proposed AAA Architecture for Authentication and Route Optimization
The six messages are defined for the authentication using AAA in care of RO. In the
first step, the MN sends the authentication request message(EAPoL) to attendant to
authenticate itself and get the key materials where the LC, NAI of the MN, RPI, HoA,
HaA, an address of CN, aaa_key, attendant_key, SecureParam_I and CR are included
in the request message. Upon receiving the message, the attendant relays the message
to its AAA server after making a conversion of message syntax from EAPoL to
Diameter. The two groups of AVP are defined such as Address AVP (Home-AddressOption, Home-Agent-Address-Option, CN-Address-Option) and Security AVP
(Nonce-Option, AAA-Key-Option, Attendant-Key-Option, Security-ParameterOption and Authenticator-Option). After referencing the NAI option in Diameter

message, the V_AAA finds out the home AAA server of the MN and forwards the
message to it without modification. In turn, the home AAA server sends the keying
materials sent from the MN to CN after finding the address of the CN by using the
Address AVP. If the destination of the message is multiple CNs, the CN-AddressOption for two or more CNs are included in the message. H_AAA copies the
message and sends the same message (ACR) to multiple destination after converting
the Diameter message to private message format known to CN where the address of
MN and SecureParam_I are included in it. Receiving the messages, the CN stores the
SecureParam_I and returns the ACR where the SecureParam_R containing the
security association generated from the CN is included. H_AAA receives the ACR
and sends it to V_AAA after making a conversion to Diameter format where the
SecureParam_R and result code are rebuilt as a AVP form, Security AVP(SecurityParameter-Option) and Action AVP(Result-Code-Option). Upon receiving the
messages, the CN stores the SecureParam_I and returns the ACR where the
SecureParam_R containing the security association generated from the CN is
included. H_AAA receives the ACR and sends it to V_AAA after making a
conversion to Diameter format where the SecureParam_R and result code are rebuilt
as a AVP form, Security AVP(Security-Parameter-Option) and Action AVP(ResultCode-Option). If the MN and CN belong to different domains, the message exchanges
between them is represented in Fig.2.

4 Performance Evaluation
4.1 System Model
The performance evaluation is based on the costs during the MN is completing the
registration to CN for the RO after successful home registration. This paper refers to
the approach described in [9] and [10]. We assume that the CN sends the packets to
MN in the ratio of λ and the MN moves into another subnet in the ratio of µ . By
considering the average number of packets delivered from the CN to MN for every
movement, the Packet to Mobile Ratio (PMR) is defined as p = λ / µ .

Fig. 3. A System Model for Cost Analysis

In this model, the internal and external link is connected each other and the weight is
given to 1 and 2 for internal and external link, respectively. Thus a=2, b=1, c=1, d=2,
i=2 and h=2 in Fig. 3.
4.2 Analysis of AAA Authentication Cost in Mobile IPv6
In the RR exchange[3], the total cost during the time where the MN moves and
registers it's location to CN is denoted as CRR . It is the sum of the cost s such as the
cost of the MN completing the home registration( CBUHA − RR ), the cost of packet loss
due to the delay of home registration( Closs − RR ), the cost of registering the MN's
location to CN for route optimization( CBU − RR ) and the tunneling cost of packets
sent from CN to MN via HA during this time( Cdt − RR ) as follows.

C RR = (C BUHA−RR + Closs−RR ) + (C BU −RR + C dt − RR )

(1)

The CBUHA − RR is (2h + 3r ) as the home registration cost and Closs − RR is the cost
of packets generated and sent to MN from CN during the registration delay time that
are treated as the packet loss. The Cdata the tunneling cost of single packet during the
registration delay in Mobile IP is denoted as A(i + h) + 3r which means the cost of a
packet traveling from CN to MN through the HA. Thus, Closs − RR is obtained as
follow.

Closs−RR = λ × t BUHA−RR × Cdata = λ (2th + 3tr ) × A ((i + h ) + 3r )

(2)

The cost of completing the binding registration for RO using the RR after home
registration is defined as CBU − RR which is denoted by the sum of costs depending on
the distance and packet processing cost at each node.

C BU −RR = 2 (i + h ) + 4 d + 9r = 2(2 d + i + h) + 9r

(3)

During the delay in the RR process, the packets destined to MN are tunneled to HA
where the tunneling cost is defined as follows.

A Mutual Authentication and Route Optimization Method between MN and CN

C dt −RR = λ × t BU −RR × Cdata

1221

(4)

The RR processing delay time is obtained as the sum of the transmission time of each
link involved in packet traveling and the packet processing time at each node.

t BU −RR = 2(2t d + ti + t h ) + 9tr

(5)

Therefore, putting all together, we can obtain the total cost of the RR as follows.

C RR = 2(2 d + i + 2h) + 12r +
λ(2(2t d + ti + 2th ) + 12tr ) × ( A (i + h) + 3r )

(6)

For the proposed scheme, CAAA the total cost of completing the RO starting from the
MN's movement is represented as formula 7 in the same manner of RR where the
CBUHA − AAA means the home registration cost, (2h + 3r ) of MN registering its CoA
to HA and Closs − AAA is the cost of the packet lost during the home registration delay
since the packets are lost during that time( tBUHA − AAA ) before completing the home
registration. .

C AAA = (C BUHA− AAA + Closs− AAA ) + (C BU − AAA + C dt − AAA )

(7)

(2h + 3r ) is obtained as follows where the Cdata = l (i + h) + 3r means the
tunneling cost for a single data packet traveling from CN to MN via HA during the
registration delay.

Closs− AAA = λ × t BUHA− AAA × Cdata = λ((2t h + 3tr ) × A ((i + h) + 3r )

(8)

CBU − AAA , the cost of authenticating MN and registering its location is denoted as
follows.

C BU − AAA = 4(b + c) + 2(a + d ) + 13r

(9)

During the delay for authenticating peers and registering to CN, the packets from CN
to MN traverse via HA. It implies the cost of tunneling packets as follows.

C dt − AAA = λ × t BU − AAA × C data

(10)

The tunneling cost of the single packet ( Cdata ) is denoted by l (i + h) + 3r which
means the cost of packet from CN to MN via HA. In our scheme, the delay time of
authentication and registration is as follows.

t BU − AAA = 4(t b + t c ) + 2(t c + t d ) + 13tr

(11)

Therefore, the total cost of the proposed scheme is obtained as follows.

C AAA = (4(b + c) + 2(a + d + h) + 16r ) +
λ(4(t b + tc ) + 2(t a + t d + t h ) + 16tr ) × ( A(i + h) + 3r )

(12)

The cost ratio of the proposed scheme to the RR ( CAAA / CRR ) is obtained as equation
13 where the λ is replaced with p ⋅ µ according to the definition of

in accordance with the variation of the PMR.

4.3 Performance Evaluation
We assume the cost of processing a message at each node is the same( r =1). Also
according the assumption that the cost weight of the link within the domain is
1(b=c=1) and the link of entities in different domains is 2, the result of the formula 13

shows the graph in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 depending on the variation of PMR value for the
case of pedestrian speed and vehicle speed, respectively. As the MN moves faster, the
traffic between MN and CN is increased and the cost ratio ( CAAA / CRR ) is significantly reduced.
In Fig. 5, at the PMR value of 43, the relative cost becoms down to 0.84 and 0.8
when the average packet length is 100 bytes and 1024 bytes, respectively.

5 Conclusions
This paper proposes a scheme to authentication the system model to analyze the cost
and defines the Packet to Mobility Ratio(PMR) as average number of packets per
movement. The cost the proposed scheme is compared to the RR and analyzed the
variation of the cost ratio depend on PMR value. As the result of analysis, the more
the PMR value is increasing, the more the cost of the proposed scheme is going down
significantly in comparing with RR. The proposed scheme saves the cost about 16 and
20 percent than RR while the MN moves at the pedestrian speed where the average
length of data packet is 100 and 1024 bytes, respectively. At vehicle speed, it saves
the cost about 20 percent. we expect that the result of the proposed scheme is
applicable to the new coming RO solution integrated with existing security
infrastructure such as AAA.
