Abstract. Rational functions are often used to model and to interpolate frequency-domain data. The data samples, required to obtain an
accurate model, can be computationally expensive to simulate. Using
the frequency derivatives of the data signiﬁcantly reduces the number of
support samples, since they provide additional information during the
modeling process. They are particularly useful when the data is sparse
and the samples are selected adaptively.

Introduction

The simulation of complex structures can be computationally very expensive
and resource-demanding. One often wants to minimize the number of costly
data samples, in order to obtain an accurate model in an acceptable amount of
time [1]. The computational cost of higher-order derivatives is sometimes only
a fraction of the cost of simulating additional samples. Some Finite Element
Method (FEM) simulators, such as the High Frequency Structure Simulator
(HFSS) [2] can take advantage of this property.
The Model Based Parameter Estimation (MBPE) [3][4] is an eﬃcient technique to model Linear Time Invariant systems (LTI) in the frequency domain
using a rational pole-zero function. By expanding the numerator and denominator in a Forsythe polynomial basis [5], some numerical instabilities are improved,
since this makes the normal equations best conditioned [6]. Furthermore, by using multiple spline interpolation with adaptive knot placement [7], the numerical
stability issues of highly complex multi-pole systems can be circumvented.
In this paper, we extend MBPE so that the frequency derivatives of the data
can be taken into account.

Model Based Parameter Estimation
Rational Model

Using the Model Based Parameter Estimation (MBPE) technique, the frequency
domain data can be modeled by a rational transfer function :
H(fs ) =

N
n
n=0 Nn .(j2πfs )
D
d
d=0 Dd .(j2πfs )

or equivalently :

.H(fs ) =

Dd .(j2πfs )d

Nn .(j2πfs )n

(2)

n=0

d=0

where the H(fs ) represent the data samples simulated at the discrete frequency
fs , ∀s = 0, ..., S. N and D are the order of numerator and denominator respectively. Coeﬃcient D0 can be set to 1 without loss of generality, since it is always
possible to convert to this form by dividing numerator and denominator by D0 .
The calculation of numerator and denominator coeﬃcients in this polynomial basis (the power series) leads to an ill-conditioned Vandermonde system.
For highly dynamic systems, severe numerical problems will make the results
inaccurate and completely useless. Therefore, the numerator and denominator
of the rational function will be decomposed in a separate basis of Forsythe polynomials. This approach guarantees that the set of normal equations are best
conditioned [8].
2.2

Forsythe Polynomials

The Forsythe polynomials are derived from the following three-term recurrence
relation :
p−1 (f ) = 0
P0 (f ) = 1

(3)

P1 (f ) = j2πf.p0 (f )
...
Pi (f ) = j2πf.pi−1 (f ) + βi−1 .pi−2 (f )
The coeﬃcients β are calculated by summation over all negative and positive
sample frequencies
S

[Pi (fs )][Pi (fs )]∗

βi =

(4)

s=0

which leads to the following orthonormal Forsythe polynomials
pi (f ) =

Pi (f )
βi

(5)

The polynomials are orthonormal over the discrete sample set fs , such that
S

[pm (fs )].[pn (fs )]∗ = δmn

∀0 ≤ m, n < S

(6)

s=0

After performing the basis transformation, the coeﬃcients of numerator and
denominator can be calculated by solving the following set of equations for all
frequencies fs with a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) :
As x = b s
where

(7)

[−p0 (fs )] ...
[−p0 (fs )] ...

[−p0 (fs )H(fs )]

bs =

(10)

Note that the system can be overdetermined, such that the number of rows
in matrix A exceeds the number of columns (or the number of unknown coeﬃcients).

Derivatives

Now assume that frequency derivatives of the data are available at the discrete
frequencies fs .
(t)
If pi (fs ) represents the tth derivative of the ith Forsythe polynomial, evaluated in frequency fs , it can be expressed as :
(t−1)

(t)

pi (fs ) =

(t)

t.pi−1 (fs ) + j2πf.pti−1 (fs ) + βi−1 .pi−2 (fs )
βi

(11)

To avoid a breakdown of the orthogonality, virtual samples are introduced
when frequency derivatives are used.
Equation (2) can be generalized by taking the frequency derivatives into
account. The coeﬃcients Nn and Dn of the rational ﬁtting model now satisfy :
D

N
(0)

H (t) (fs ).

Dd .pd (fs ) =

Nn .p(t)
n (fs )

D
(k)

−

Dd .pd (fs ).H (t−k) (fs ).
k=1 d=k

(t)

(12)

n=t

t!
k!(t − k)!

where pn is the tth order derivative of the nth order numerator Forsythe poly(t)
nomial, pd is the tth order derivative of the dth order denominator Forsythe
polynomial, and H (t) is the tth order derivative of the frequency domain data.
All derivatives are relative to j2πf . The set of equations at all frequencies f and
for all derivatives t, can be written in a matrix form, similar to equation (7).
In some cases, the magnitude of the derivatives can be extremely small or
large. Calculating the coeﬃcients using all the information can make the corresponding least-squares system ill-conditioned. Therefore it is recommended to
check the magnitude of the derivatives before they are used. A trade-oﬀ needs
to be made between the loss of information and the loss of numerical stability.

Fast Frequency Sweep

To minimize the cost of simulating computationally expensive data samples, an
adaptive algorithm is used that automatically selects a minimal sample distribution and model complexity [1].
The ﬂow chart of the algorithm is shown in Figure 1. It consists of an adaptive
modeling loop, and an adaptive sample selection loop.
The algorithm starts with 4 samples equidistantly spaced over a certain frequency range of interest. Depending on the number of available data samples,
multiple rational models are built with diﬀerent order of numerator and denominator, exploiting all degrees of freedom.
The rational ﬁtting models are evaluated in the data points, and compared
against one another. If the error between the rational model (and its derivatives)
evaluated in the selected sample points and the simulated data samples (and its
derivatives), exceeds a certain threshold, the model is rejected, and the model’s
complexity is increased. All models with diﬀerent order of numerator and denominator are ranked, and the 2 best models (i.e. with lowest overall error) are
retained.
The diﬀerence between the two models is called the estimated ﬁtting error,
and new samples should be chosen in such way, that the maximum estimated
ﬁtting error is minimized. A reliable way to estimate the ﬁtting error, and select
new samples is given in [1]. Optionally, the algorithm can be extended with an
adaptive spline selection loop, as introduced in [7].

Example: Ring Resonator

The new proposed technique is used to model the reﬂection coeﬃcients S11 of
a microwave RingResonator over the frequency range [1 GHz - 1.2 GHz]. The
desired accuracy level is -60 dB, which corresponds to 3 signiﬁcant digits. A
highly accurate full-wave electro-magnetic simulator Momentum [9] is used to
simulate the sparse data samples.

each iteration of the algorithm, new samples are selected where the estimated
error (the diﬀerence between 2 rational approximants, based on the same set
of support samples) is maximal. Based on the extra data points, new rational
models are built and evaluated, and the estimated error function is updated.
The iterative process is repeated until the error is below a predeﬁned accuracy
threshold. In this example, 8 support samples are automatically selected, to
obtain the required precision.
In Figure 3a-b, the ﬁrst frequency derivatives are also used in the modeling
process. This additional information is exploited by the algorithm, and now it

only needs 5 samples to ﬁnd an accurate model. In this example, the extra sample
was chosen very eﬃciently in the dip of the resonance.
In Figure 4, the second frequency derivatives are also used in the modeling
process. The initial set of equally distributed samples already guarantee suﬃcient
accuracy.
Of course, it can be useful to take also higher-order derivatives into account,
especially if the behaviour of the system is highly dynamic. Typically, if more
derivatives are used, fewer samples will be needed to get an accurate model.
However, the value of the higher order derivatives in determining the model
parameters is usually less than the value of lower order derivatives or samples,
partially due to numerical issues.

Conclusion

In this paper, we extend the MBPE technique with frequency derivatives. During
the adaptive modeling process, this reduces the number of required support
samples signiﬁcantly. This approach is particularly useful if the computational
cost of simulating the required support samples is very high, and when the
samples are selected adaptively. And so, an accurate model can be obtained,
using a minimal set of data samples and their frequency derivatives. The stability
of the algorithm is improved by a transformation of the rational model into a
generalized Forsythe orthonormal basis, which makes the normal equations of
the least squares system best conditioned.
