Abstract. In recent paper [5] a procedure was developed to control a
step size for Runge-Kutta methods. Here, we present a new version of
that step size selection to make it better in exceptional cases when the
old version does not work appropriately.

In this paper, we consider a system of diﬀerential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of
the form
x (t) = g x(t), y(t) , y(t) = f x(t), y(t) ,
(1)
where t ∈ [0, T ], x(t) ∈ Rm , y(t) ∈ Rn , g : D ⊂ Rm+n → Rm , f : D ⊂ Rm+n →
Rn , and where an initial conditions x(0) = x0 , y(0) = y 0 are also given and they
are consistent; i. e., y 0 = f (x0 , y 0 ). We suppose that problem (1) possesses an
def

T

on the interval [0, T ].
unique solution z(t) = x(t)T , y(t)T
To solve problem (1) numerically, we applied an l-stage Runge-Kutta (RK)
method and come to the following discrete system:
l

xki = xk + τk

aij g(xkj , ykj ),

yki = f (xki , yki ),

i = 1, 2, ..., l,

xk+1 = xk + τk

bi g(xki , yki ), yk+1 = f (xk+1 , yk+1 ), k = 0, 1, ..., K − 1, (2b)

We assume further that the RK formula is of order s, and that problem (1)
satisﬁes the smoothness condition and the nonsingularity one in a neighborhood
of the solution z(t) on the interval [0, T ] (we refer to [5] for details).
It is well-known [1], [2], [3] that under the conditions mentioned above problem (1) is of index 1 and method (2) is convergent of order s. Moreover, it was
proved in [3] that the local error of method (2) has the form
x(tk+1 ) − x
˜k+1 = ψˇs+1 (tk )τks+1 + O(τks+2 ),

(3a)

y(tk+1 ) − y˜k+1 = φˇs+1 (tk )τks+1 + O(τks+2 ),

of (2) provided that zk = z(tk ), and the functions ψs+1 (tk ), φs+1 (tk ) denote the
coeﬃcients of leading terms of the local error of RK method (2). In addition,
Theorem 2.1 in [4] establishes that the global error of method (2) possesses the
following asymptotic expansion:
x(tk+1 ) − xk+1 = ψs (tk+1 )(τk∗ )s + O (τk∗ )s+1 ,

y(tk+1 ) − yk+1 = φs (tk+1 )(τk∗ )s + O (τk∗ )s+1 ,

k = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1, as τk∗ → 0, where the pair of functions ψs (t) and φs (t) is a
solution of the DAEs
ψs (t) = ∂x g x(t), y(t) ψs (t) + ∂y g x(t), y(t) φs (t) + ψˇs+1 (t),

(5a)

φs (t) = ∂x f x(t), y(t) ψs (t) + ∂y f x(t), y(t) φs (t),

ψs (0) = 0,

φs (0) = 0.

The new step size τk∗ in formulas (4) means a step size for integrating problem (1)
in the local interval [tk , tk+1 ] by a ﬁxed step size version of method (2). Below,
we will discuss how to deﬁne it more precisely.
Taking into account possible stiﬀness of problem (5), we apply the implicit
Euler method to this problem and obtain the following recursion relation for an
approximate computation of the functions ψs (t) and φs (t):
ψ˜s (tk+1 )
φ˜s (tk+1 )

In formula (6a), 0 denotes the null vector of dimension n, but full particularities
can be found in [5].
The next important stage in the numerical integration of semi-explicit DAEs
of index 1 is a selection of the maximum step size keeping the truncated local and
global errors bounded. Let l and g be given limits for the local and global errors
of method (2), respectively. Considering that the global error of the numerical
solution at the point tk does not exceed g , we now explain how to ﬁnd an
approximate solution of problem (1) at the point tk+1 with the given accuracy.
We ﬁrst compute the local error at the point tk+1 , by using any classical
approach, with the accuracy l (see, for example, [3]). After that we determine

the coeﬃcient of the principal term of the global error by formulas (6). Then we
ﬁnd the maximum step size τk∗ guaranteeing the necessary accuracy1 :

Further, we solve problem (1) on the local interval [tk , tk+1 ] by method (2) with
the ﬁxed step size τk∗ and obtain the numerical solution at the point tk+1 with
the accuracy g . Moreover, in order to compensate the inﬂuence of the rejected
terms in global error expansion (4) we improve the numerical solution by means
of Richardson extrapolation or two RK methods of diﬀerent orders. Now we set
the next step size τk+1 = τk∗ and repeat all the computations at the next time
point, and so on.
In [5], it was shown that, with a practical point of view, it is important to
use the stable version of the local-global step size control with an additional
bound gl . To demonstrate the nice practical properties of the stable controller,
we apply the Trapezoidal Rule with Newton iteration (TRN method) to the
restricted three body problem in diﬀerential-algebraic formulation [5].

From the data of Table 1 it follows that the variable step size TRN method
with the stable local-global error control mechanism achieves automatically any
reasonable accuracy preassigned for the numerical solution, even when only one
Newton iteration per each time point has been fulﬁlled.

Let us now show that the stable local-global step size control sometimes cannot provide the required accuracy. To illustrate this, we take the TRN method
with trivial predictor and apply it to the restricted three body problem on the
double interval [0, 2T ]; i. e. we have increased the length of the integration segment by a factor of 2. This makes the test problem more diﬃcult for solving with
the guaranteed accuracy because of round-oﬀ errors and the omitted terms in
global error expansion (4). Indeed, the numerical results demonstrate that our
error control mechanism cannot provide the required accuracy for any number
of Newton iterations per time point (see Table 2).
To improve the local-global step size control in order to solve our test problem
with the necessary accuracy, we involve more terms of the global error expansion
in the error control procedure. First of all Richardson extrapolation gives us a
way to ﬁnd any reasonable number of the ﬁrst terms in the local error expansion.
Then, by substitution of the coeﬃcients of these terms in the inhomogeneous
part of equation (5a), we obtain systems of linear DAEs for the coeﬃcients of
relevant terms in the global error expansion. After that we can use the main
ideas discussed above in order to compute and control some ﬁrst leading terms
of the global error of Runge-Kutta methods. If we now derive the advanced stable
local-global step size control based on the computation of the two ﬁrst leading
terms of the global error expansion and apply it to our test problem then we
see that the new advanced version of the step size control is more reliable for
practical use (see Table 3). Finally, it is necessary to point out that, as the last
example shows, the suﬃcient quantity of Newton iterations is very important
for our step size control to be valid. We refer to [6] for more details.
