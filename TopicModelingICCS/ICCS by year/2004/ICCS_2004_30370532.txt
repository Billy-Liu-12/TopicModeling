Abstract. During the last years the use of intelligent strategies for
tuning Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers has been
growing. The evolutionary strategies have won an important place
thanks to their ﬂexibility. In this paper, the automatic tuning of
systems with scarce initial information and integrative and unstable
dynamics, through a genetic approach is presented. The advantages of
the proposed approach were highlighted through the comparison with
the Ziegler-Nichols modiﬁed closed loop method, and the Visioli genetic
approach. The proposed methodology goal is to expand the intelligent
tuning application to a wider range of processes (covering systems with
oscillatory or unstable modes).
Keywords: PID Controllers, Genetic Algorithms.

The ﬁrst attempts to automate the tuning of Proportional-Integral-Derivative
(PID) controllers were based on the time response of a process, but this approach
had the drawback of requiring a lot of user interaction. A very important advance
was made when it was decided to use the frequency response of a process instead
of its time response, in this way a bigger degree of automation was attained. The
ﬁrst industrial PID controller based on processes’ frequency response, was the
Novatune [1], which initialized a PID controller automatically.
Applications based on PID controllers using frequency response were very
successful [1] [2] [3], however the range of their applicability is restricted to
asymptotically stable systems, due to the use of the relay feedback. By using

evolutionary meta heuristics, like Genetic Algorithms (GA), it is possible to
expand the application range of PID controllers to systems with oscillatory or
unstable modes. The application of GA to control applications has been increasing steadily and recently GA were applied: a) to tune Multiple-Input-MultipleOutput (MIMO) systems [4] [5]; and b) to improve signiﬁcantly the performance
of plants [6].
In this paper, a GA was used to automate the tuning of systems with scarce
initial information and integrative and unstable dynamics, in order to get insight
of the advantages of using a GA, the results were compared against the ZieglerNichols modiﬁed closed loop method. The rest of the paper is organized in four
more sections: a) in section two the Ziegler-Nichols closed loop control method
is presented; b) in section 3 the Visioli genetic method for integral and unstable processes was highlighted; c) in section 4 the Direct Genetic PID proposed
method, that is able to complement the Ziegler-Nichols and Visioli methods is
presented; and d) ﬁnally in section 5 main conclusions will be presented.

Ziegler-Nichols Closed Loop Method

With the microprocessor arrival, the industrial ﬁeld controllers’ horizons were
expanded, thanks to the capacity to carry out elaborated algorithms. This situation encouraged some controller makers to develop auto tuning PID controllers.
One example of this controllers is the Foxboro EXACT [7], whose operation was
based on the transient response analysis. An alternative was the use of Ziegler
and Nichols closed-loop method [7]. The original method consists of varying the
proportional gain until a sustained oscillation is reached. Maintaining the system
in this state, the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations are determined by
measuring the system output. A PID controller has the standard form depicted
in equation (1), where u(t) deﬁnes the controller output (also called process
output), e(t) is the system error (diﬀerence among the desired set point for the
variable under control, and the actual process variable value), Kp indicates the
proportional gain, Td is the derivative time constant, and Ti is the integral time
constant.

The PID controller parameters for equation (1) are calculated and ﬁxed according to the table 1, where Ku is the ultimate gain, and Tu is the ultimate
period. The Ziegler and Nichols method for tuning an ISA PID controller, is a
thumb rule based on the Nyquist curve. According to the Nyquist theorem a
process is stable if the Nyquist curve does not encircle the point (-1,0).

that the original free oscillations system. A non linear circuit was introduced.
The non linear function has a relay characteristic. To obtain the value of the
proportional gain according to the table 1 is necessary to calculate the equation
(2) where d is the output relay amplitude and a is the oscillation amplitude,
while Tu (necessary to obtain Ti and Td ) is measured directly of the oscillations.

Stability of Limit Cycle

The relay feedback method is successfully used in the industry [1], however
to measure Ku and Tu is fundamental that the limit cycle were stable and
symmetric. ˚
Astr¨
om[8] developed an analysis consisting in obtaining the Jacobian
of the Poincar´e map (W ) which is related to the relay oscillations; the limit cycle
is locally stable if and only if W has all its eigenvalues inside the unit disk. The
phase portrait is a practical way to know if a process oscillation is stable or
not, when the relay feedback is applied. Suppose the plant described in equation
(3).The phase portrait of equation (3) obtained during the relay experiment is
shown in the ﬁgure 1(a) . We can observe in the phase portrait that exists a
stable limit cycle.

Now, if we take the phase portrait of the process represented in equation (4),
the limit cycle is unstable, and it can be observed in ﬁgure 1(b). It is possible
to obtain similar results for processes described in equations (5) and (6), given
that, their limit cycles are stable but no asymptotically stable [8] (also these
processes are unstable when the feedback relay is used).

Generally the integrative and unstable processes do not allow reaching a
controlled oscillation. If do not exist a stable oscillation it is not possible to
apply the Ziegler and Nichols methods, one of the alternatives to tuning PID
controllers for integral and unstable processes is the use of GA. The Visioli
method [12] presented in next section uses internally a GA.

Visioli Genetic Method for Integral and Unstable
Processes

In this section, a brief introduction to GA concepts will be presented ﬁrst, and
then the Visioli method (based on GA) is detailed. The original idea of GA was to
achieve that the computing processes could have an evolutionary proﬁle. In the
last years there has been an important increase of genetic algorithms applications
to the automatic control ﬁeld. A genetic algorithm emulates an evolutionary
process [11], thanks to a generation of virtual individuals population. The virtual
population has a reproduction and death process, which allow space for a new
generation. According to the schemata theorem [11] if reproduction possibilities
for the better adapted individual are increased, the future generations will be
more capable on the average than their predecessors. If we take the population
individuals as potential solutions of a problem, and we build the algorithm so
that the most capable individuals are the nearest to the solution, then we can
hope after a certain number of generations, the solution to our problem.
Visioli presents in [12] a methodology for tuning PID controllers for integral
and unstable processes. The method consists on a set of rules for integral and
unstable processes, which are similar to the Ziegler and Nichols rules. These rules
were obtained using a Genetic Algorithm optimization approach. The method
contemplates the structure described in equation (7) for integrative processes

(K is the transfer function gain, and L is the system delay), and the structure
described in equation (8) for unstable processes (T is a time response rate).

In a Visioli paper [12] tables for tuning rules for optimal set-point response
for unstable processes can be found. The rules are optimized to minimize the
integral of the quadratic error (ISE).
Suppose an unstable plant whose transfer function is given by the equation
(9). In accordance with Visioli rules [12], the parameter values will be: Kp = 5.8,
Ti = 1.88, and Td = 0.11. In the ﬁgure 4(a) the response of the process described
in equation (9) when is controlled by the equation (1) is shown.

The main virtue of the Visioli method is its simplicity of use; however it has
three important disadvantages: a)an identiﬁed model of the process is needed;
b) the identiﬁed model has to be of ﬁrst order approach; and c) If L = 0 (L is
the system delay), the method can not be used. In the next section we propose a
methodology for tuning a PID control for integral and unstable process which is
independent to the transfer function order. The method is a direct optimization
of the controller parameters across a genetic algorithm, as it will be shown this
method is superior to the Visioli approach.

Direct Genetic PID

The use of genetic algorithms for tuning PID controllers has been growing, because is very easy to connect the structure of the controller with the optimization
strategy. The genetic algorithm task is to optimize the controller parameters,
by means of an evolutionary process. Suppose a chromosome coded as is indicated in equation (10), where Ck is the gain chromosome. Ck represents a
simple individual whose genes are the PID controller parameters (Ck = Kp Ti Td ,
Kp = p1 , p2 , ..., pn , Ti = i1 , i2 , ..., in , and Td = d1 , d2 , ..., dn ) . Every chromosome
is tested and evaluated. The individuals with ﬁtness higher than the average shall
have more reproduction opportunities. The gains that allow a better control performance give more chance to inherit the chromosome proﬁle. To optimize the
search, the decoding indicated in equation (11) is carried out. In equation (11),
Ai is a gene of the chromosome Ck , which is weighted by a decoder weight i,
ﬁxed in a heuristic way (see [4]), and Ki is a gain used by the equation (1). In
the ﬁgure 2 is shown the optimization process, and it can be observed an on
line identiﬁcation process which use recursive least squares (RLS). The intern

model is used in the ﬁtness function described in equation (12), where ri is the
reference point, y is the estimated process and n is a value that allows the output
process establishment, when it is stable otherwise n will have a default value.
In the equation (12), the minimization criterion is the integral of absolute error
(IAE).

The higher qualiﬁed individuals are those that minimize the equation (12).
The controller parameters are modiﬁed using a commutation only when an important parameter variation happens.
The genetic algorithm for the optimization has a population of 100 members.
In every reproduction process a tournament selection is performed involving 10%
of population. The maximum allele value is 9.0072 × 1015 . For maximum focus
in the search, decoding considers the value dividing the allele between ten times
its maximum value. A mutation process which involves 10% of the population is
applied.
Previously, it was stated that the process described in equation (4) does not
have a stable limit cycle; therefore it is not possible to use the Ziegler and Nichols
methods. Applying the Direct Genetic PID, it is possible to control a marginally
stable process. In the ﬁgure 3(a), it is shown the plant controlled output and
the evolutionary process evolution. The resultants gains for the process deﬁned
in equation (4) are Kp = 0.156, Ti = 0.312 and Td = 9.96.

in equation (5) is presented in ﬁgure 3(b). The resultants gains for the process
described in equation (5) are Kp = 4.251, Ti = 99.16 and Td = 0.781. Also is
shown the control for the unstable delayed process described by equation (9) in
ﬁgure 4(b). The resultants gains for the process described in equation (9) are
Kp = 2.910, Ti = 1.367 and Td = 0.135.

Conclusions

In this paper a new Genetic PID approach was presented to make control of systems with oscillatory or unstable modes. The main advantages of the presented
method relate to the possibility of make PID tuning when other methods have
failed (the Visioli method is not able to handle the case when L = 0 meanwhile
the proposed method is capable to handle this case). Satisfactory results were
observed through the exhibited tests in the paper. It is intended that the Genetic
PID approach can be connected easily as a backup controller for other adaptive
controllers. It is remarkable that the Genetic PID approach proposed does not
require to know the process features, because an estimation stage (RLS) can be
used.
