Abstract. Information on protein-protein interactions provides valuable insight
into the underlying mechanism of protein functions. However, the accuracy of
protein-protein interaction data obtained by high-throughput experimental
methods is low, and thus requires a rigorous assessment of their reliability. This
paper proposes a computational method for predicting the unknown function of
a protein interacting with a protein with known function, and presents the
experimental results of applying the method to the protein-protein interactions
in yeast and human. This method can also be used to assess the reliability of the
protein-protein interaction data.

1 Introduction
High-throughput experimental techniques enable the study of protein-protein
interactions at the proteome scale through systematic identification of physical
interactions among all proteins in an organism [1]. The increasing volume of proteinprotein interaction data is becoming the foundation for new biological discoveries.
Protein-protein interactions play important roles in nearly all events that take place in
a cell [1]. Particularly valuable will be analyses of proteins that play pivotal roles in
biological phenomena in which the physiological interactions of many proteins are
involved in the construction of biological pathways, such as metabolic and signal
transduction pathways [2].
Here is a more elaborate example. All biochemical process is regulated through
protein function. Therefore, diseases (hereditary/non-hereditary) are made manifest as
a result of protein function. Also, finding protein function is necessary for the normal
progression of medicinal development. Thus, with the completion of genome
sequencing of several organisms, the functional annotation of the proteins is of most
importance [3]. This function is considered as property of sequence or structure.
Several research groups have developed methods for functional annotation. The
classical way is to find homologies between a protein and other proteins in databases
using programs such as FASTA and PSI-BLAST, and then predict functions [3].
Another approach is called the Rosetta stone method, where two proteins are inferred
to interact if they are together in another genome [3]. We propose a method for
determining the reliability of the protein-protein interaction data obtained by high*

throughput experimental methods. This method can also be used for predicting the
unknown function of a protein interacting with a protein with known function.

2 Analysis of Yeast Protein Data
2.1 Data Sets
The data of yeast protein interactions were obtained from the Comprehensive Yeast
Genome Database (CYGD) at MIPS [7]. After removing 1,150 redundant data, 9,490
non-redundant interactions were left. In addition to the interaction data, the
information on the yeast protein catalogue such as class, enzyme code number, motif,
function, complex and cell localization were extracted. Table 1 shows the number of
yeast protein entries in each catalogue.

The function catalogue in particular is important because the primary focus of this
study is the prediction of protein functions. We shall now examine the function
catalogue more closely.
Functions of yeast proteins were all arranged from FunCat (The Functional
Catalogue) of MIPS. The FunCat is an annotation scheme for the functional
description of proteins from prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, plants and animals
[7]. Taking into account the broad and highly diverse spectrum of known protein
functions, the FunCat consists of 30 main functional categories (or branches) that
cover general fields like cellular transport, metabolism and signal transduction [7].
The main branches exhibit a hierarchical, tree like structure with up to six levels of
increasing specificity [7]. In total, the FunCat has 1,445 functional categories. Among
of them, 215 functional categories were applied to yeast. Tables 2 and 3 show the
number of yeast protein entries and yeast proteins, respectively, in each functional
category of FunCat.

2.2 Analysis Results
The protein interaction data in each catalogue of Table 1 were analyzed. As shown in
Fig. 1, the proteins in a same complex interact with the highest probability (0.33), and
the proteins with a same function interact with the second highest probability (0.28).
The proteins in a same complex interact and with a same function interact with the
probability of 0.39, which is higher than 0.33 and 0.28 but not much higher. This
implies that a large portion of the proteins in the two catalogues overlap.
The ratio of the number of interactions between proteins in a same complex to the
total number of interactions is 0.25. The ratio of the number interactions between
proteins with a same function to the number of interactions between proteins in a
same complex is 0.97. This indicates that interacting proteins in a same complex also
have a same function with a high probability. The inverse is not necessarily true.
Consequently, we discovered an association rule: If proteins A and B are in a same
complex and interact each other, proteins A and B have a same function.

This rule is also confirmed in the protein-protein interaction networks of Fig. 2.
Fig. 2A shows a network of interactions between proteins in a same complex,
visualized by InterViewer [4, 5]. Interacting proteins with a same function are
selected from this network and shown in green. Most nodes of Fig. 2A are selected as
proteins involved with the interactions between proteins with a same function. Figure
2B shows a network of interactions between proteins with a same function.
Interacting proteins in a same complex are selected from this network and shown in
green, too. Only a small portion of the entire nodes is selected.

3 Prediction of Human Protein Function
Uetz et al. [8] and Ito et al. [9] show that the function of uncharacterized proteins can
be predicted in the light of the interacting partner by using the principle of ‘guilt by
association’, which maintains that two interacting proteins are likely to participate in
the same cellular function [2, 6].
Since the function of many human proteins is unknown, we predicted the function
of human proteins. Suppose that SPj is a protein with unknown function, Pi is a protein
interacting with SPj, AF is the total number of functions of interacting proteins, AP is
the total number of interacting proteins, and that DPi is the degree of a particular
partner protein. Then the score function for assessing the probability that protein SPj
has the same function with protein Pi can be computed by equation 1.

Score ( j , i ) = DPi ×

where CPi is a complex constant. Algorithms 1-3 describe how to predict the function
of a protein. In the algorithms, protein_num is the number of gathered proteins, and
cnt represents the number of interacting partners with a same function. All interaction
data are cleaned first by Algorithm 2, and the function of interacting partners is
counted in Algorithm 3.

4 Conclusion
Proteins have many different biological functions by interacting with other proteins,
and two interacting proteins are likely to have same biological function. Therefore, if

a protein with known function is identified to interact with an uncharacterized protein,
the function of the uncharacterized protein can be predicted. From the analysis of the
experimental data of yeast protein interactions, we discovered a reliable association
rule that “if proteins A and B exist in a same complex and interact each other, proteins
A and B have a same function.” We have developed an algorithm for predicting the
function of proteins based on the association rule, and applied the algorithm to the
human protein interaction data. Experimental results show that the algorithm is
potentially useful for predicting the function of uncharacterized proteins.
