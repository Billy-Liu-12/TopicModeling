Abstract. A pre-play communication-process is presented which leads
to a Nash equilibrium of a strategic form game. In the communication
process each player predicts the other players’ actions, and he/she
communicates privately his/her conjecture through message according
to a protocol. All the players receiving the messages learn and revise
their conjectures. We show that after a long round of the communication
the proﬁle of players’ conjectures in the revision process leads a mixed
strategy Nash equilibrium of the game.

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to present the pre-play communication-process
leading to a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of a strategic form game.
The stage sets up as follows: The players start with the same prior distribution on a ﬁnite state-space. In addition they have the private information
given by the non-partition structure corresponding to the modal logic S4. Each
player communicates privately his/her conjecture about the other players’ actions through messages according to a protocol, and the receiver of the message updates her/his conjecture. When a player communicates with another,
the other players are not informed about the contents of the message. Suppose
that all players are expected utility maximizers. Then
Main Theorem. The players’ predictions about the other players’ actions regarding as the future conjectures converge in the long run, and those convergent
conjectures constitute a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the game.
The concept of Nash equilibrium has become central in game theory, economics and its related ﬁelds. Yet a little is known about the process by which

players learn if they do. Recent papers by J. S. Jordan [4] and E. Kalai and
E. Lehrer [5] indicate increasing interest in the mutual learning processes in
Bayesian games which leads to Bayesian equilibrium.
As for as Nash’s fundamental notion of strategic equilibrium (J. F. Nash [8]) is
concerned, R.J. Aumann and A. Brandenburger [1] gives epistemic conditions for
Nash equilibrium. However it is not clear just what learning process lead to Nash
equilibrium. The present paper aims to ﬁll this gap. The pre-play communication
process according to a protocol is proposed which is a mutual learning process
leading to a Nash equilibrium of a strategic form game as a cheap talk. The
emphasis is on that any topological assumption on the communication graph is
not required. T. Matsuhisa [6] proved the theorem under the assumption that
the graph contains no cycle.
This paper organizes as follows. Section 2 presents the communication process
for a game according a protocol. In Section 3 we give the explicit statement of
the main theorem (Theorem 1) and we shall prove it.

The Model

Let Ω be a non-empty set called a state-space, N a set of ﬁnitely many players
1, 2, . . . n (n ≥ 2), and let 2Ω be the family of all subsets of Ω. Each member of
2Ω is called an event and each element of Ω called a state. Let µ be a probability
measure on Ω which is common for all players.
2.1

Information and Knowledge1

An information structure (Pi )i∈N is a class of mappings Pi of Ω into 2Ω . It is
called an RT-information structure if for every player i the two properties are
true: For each ω of 2Ω ,
Ref

ξ ∈ Pi (ω)

implies

Pi (ξ) ⊆ Pi (ω).

Given our interpretation, player i for whom Pi (ω) ⊆ E knows, in the state
ω, that some state in the event E has occurred. In this case we say that in the
state ω the player i knows E. By i’s knowledge operator we mean the mapping
Ki : 2Ω → 2Ω deﬁned by Ki E = {ω ∈ Ω|Pi (ω) ⊆ E}. This is the set of states of
Ω in which i knows that E has occurred. We note that Ki satisﬁes the following
properties2 : For every E, F of 2Ω ,

and

Ki ∅ = ∅ ;

Ki (E ∩ F ) = Ki E ∩ Ki F ;

Ki F ⊆ Ki Ki F.

See Bacharach [2], Samet [10], Binmore [3]
According to these we can say the structure Ω, (Ki )i∈N is a model for the multimodal logic S4n .

The set Pi (ω) will be interpreted as the set of all the states of nature that i
believes to be possible at ω, and Ki E will be interpreted as the set of states of
nature for which i believes E to be possible. We will therefore call Pi i’s possibility
operator on Ω and also will call Pi (ω) i’s possibility set at ω. An event E is said
to be i’s truism if E ⊆ Ki E We should note that the RT -information structure
Pi is uniquely determined by the knowledge operator Ki such that Pi (ω) is the
minimal truism containing ω; that is, Pi (ω) = ω∈Ki E E = ω∈T =Ki T T.
2.2

Game and Knowledge3

By a game G we mean a ﬁnite strategic form game N, (Ai )i∈N , (gi )i∈N
with the following structure and interpretations: N is a ﬁnite set of players
{1, 2, . . . , i, . . . n} with n ≥ 2, Ai is a ﬁnite set of i’s actions (or i’s pure strategies) and gi is an i’s payoﬀ-function of A into IR, where A denotes the product
A1 × A2 × · · · × An , A−i the product A1 × A2 × · · · × Ai−1 × Ai+1 × · · · × An .
We denote by g the n-tuple (g1 , g2 , . . . gn ) and denote by a−i the (n − 1)-tuple
(a1 , . . . , ai−1 , ai+1 , . . . , an ) for a of A .
A probability distribution φi on A−i is said to be i’s overall conjecture (or
simply i’s conjecture). For each player j other than i, this induces the marginal
on j’s actions; we call it i’s individual conjecture about j (or simply i’s conjecture
about j.) Functions on Ω are viewed like random variables in a probability space
(Ω, µ). If x is a such function and x is a value of it, we denote by [x = x] (or
simply by [x]) the set {ω ∈ Ω| x(ω) = x}.
An RT -information structure (Pi )i∈N with a common-prior µ yields the distribution deﬁned by qi (a, ω) = µ([a = a]|Pi (ω)); and i’s overall conjecture deﬁned by the marginal qi (a−i , ω) = µ([a−i = a−i ]|Pi (ω)) which is viewed as a
random variable of φi . Where we assume that [ai ] := [ai = ai ] is i’s truism for
every ai of Ai . The pay-oﬀ functions g = (g1 , g2 , . . . , gn ) is said to be actually
played at a state ω if ω ∈ [g = g] := i∈N [gi = gi ]. i’s action ai is said to be
actual at a state ω if ω ∈ [ai = ai ].
Player i is said to be rational at ω if each i’s actual action ai maximizes
the expectation of his actually played pay-oﬀ function gi at ω when the other
players actions are distributed according to his conjecture qi (∗, ω): Formally,
letting gi = gi (ω) and ai = ai (ω), Exp(gi (ai , a−i ); ω) ≥ Exp(gi (bi , a−i ); ω) for
every bi in Ai .4 Let Ri denote the set of all the states at which player i is rational,
and R = ∩j∈N Rj .
2.3

Protocol5

We assume that the players in N communicate by sending messages. Let T be
the time horizontal line {0, 1, 2, · · · t, · · ·}. A protocol among N is a mapping Pr
of the set of non-negative integers into the Cartesian product N ×N that assigns

We denote Exp(gi (bi , a−i ); ω) :=

gi (bi , a−i ) qi (a−i , ω).

Communication Leading to Nash Equilibrium

to each t a pair of players (s(t), r(t)) such that s(t) = r(t). Here t stands for
time and s(t) and r(t) are, respectively, the sender and the receiver of the
communication which takes place at time t. We consider the protocol as the
directed graph whose vertices are the set of all players M and such that there
is an edge (or an arc) from i to j if and only if there are inﬁnitely many t such
that s(t) = i and r(t) = j.
A protocol is said to be fair if the graph is strongly-connected; in words,
every player in this protocol communicates directly or indirectly with every other
player inﬁnitely often. It is said to contain a cycle if there are players i1 , i2 , . . . , ik
with k ≥ 3 such that for all m < k, im communicates directly with im+1 , and
such that ik communicates directly with i1 . The period of the protocol is the
minimal number of all the natural number m such that Pr(t + m) = Pr(t) for
every t.
2.4

Pre-play Communication

By this we intuitively mean the learning process such that each player communicates privately his/her conjecture about the other players’ actions through messages according to a protocol, and she/he updates her/his conjecture according
to the message received. In addition, at every stage each player communicates
privately not only his/her conjecture about the others’ actions but also his/her
rationality as messages, the receivers update their private information and revise
their conjecture. When a player communicates with another, the other players
are not informed about the contents of the message. Formally,
Deﬁnition 1. A pre-play communication-process according to a protocol among
N for a game G with revisions of players’ conjectures is a tuple
Pr, (Pit )i∈N , (φti )i∈N | t ∈ T
with the following structures: the players have a common-prior µ on Ω, the
protocol Pr among N , Pr(t) = (s(t), r(t)), is fair and it satisﬁes the conditions
that r(t) = s(t+1) for every t and that the communications proceed in rounds.6
The information structure Pit at time t is the mapping of Ω into 2Ω for player
i that is deﬁned inductively as follows: If i = s(t) is a sender at t, he/she sends
the message Wit deﬁned as below to j = r(t) at t.
– Set Pi0 (ω) = Pi (ω).
– Assume that Pit is deﬁned. It yields the overall conjecture qti (a−i , ω) =
µ([a−i = a−i ]|Pit (ω)); whence
• Rit denotes the set of all the state ω at which i is rational according to
his conjecture qti (ω):7

That is, there exists a time m such that Pr(t) = Pr(t + m) for all t.
That is, each i’s actual action ai maximizes the expectation of his pay-oﬀ function gi
being actually played at ω when the other players actions are distributed according
to his conjecture qti (ω) at time t. Formally, letting gi = gi (ω), ai = ai (ω), the

• Qti denotes the partition induced by qit on Ω, which is decomposed into
the components Qti (ω) consisting of all the states ξ such that qit (ξ) =
qit (ω).
• Gi denotes the partition {[gi = gi ], Ω \ [gi = gi ]} of Ω, and Rti the
partition {Rit , Ω \ Rit }.
• Wit denotes the join Gi ∨ Qti ∨ Rti the partition of Ω generated by Gi , Qti
and Rti .8
– Then Pit+1 is deﬁned as follows:
• If i is a receiver of a message at time t + 1 then Pit+1 (ω) = Pit (ω) ∩

(ω).
• If not, Pit+1 (ω) = Pit (ω).
It is of worth noting that (Pit )i∈N is an RT -information structure for every
t ∈ T . We require that the pre-play communication-process satisﬁes the following
two conditions: Let Kit be the knowledge operator corresponding to Pit ;9
A-1 For each i ∈ N and every t ∈ T , [φti ] ⊆ Kit ([φti ]) and Rit ⊆ Kit (Rit );
A-2 For every t ∈ T , i∈N Kit ([gi ] ∩ [φti ] ∩ Rit ) = ∅.
The speciﬁcation of A-1 is that each player’s conjecture and his/her rationality
are truism, and the speciﬁcation of A-2 is that each player knows his/her pay-oﬀ,
rationality and conjecture at every time t.
Remark 1. For i ∈ N , the sequence of correspondences {Pit | t = 0, 1, 2, . . .} is
stationary in ﬁnitely many rounds. Furthermore so is the sequence of i’s conjectures {qti | t = 0, 1, 2, . . .} in ﬁnitely many rounds. That is, there is a suﬃciently large time τ ∈ T such that for every i, for all ω ∈ Ω and for all t ≥ τ ,
Pit (ω) = Piτ (ω), and therefore qti = qτi .
Notation: For suﬃcient large t ≥ τ we denote τ by ∞. Hence we can write qτi

Proof of Main Theorem

We now state the main theorem in Introduction as below and we shall prove it:
Theorem 1. Suppose that the players in a strategic form game have a commonprior. In a pre-play communication process according to a protocol among all
players in the game with revisions of their conjectures {(φti )i∈N | t = 0, 1, 2, . . .},
there exists a time τ such that for each t ≥ τ , the n-tuple (φti )i∈N induces a
mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the game.
expectation at time t, Expt , is deﬁned by
Expt (gi (bi , a−i ); ω) :=

gi (bi , a−i ) qti (ω)(a−i ).
a−i ∈A−i

Player i is said to be rational according to his conjecture qti (ω) at ω if for all bi in
Ai , Expt (gi (ai , a−i ); ω) ≥ Expt (gi (bi , a−i ); ω).
Therefore the component Wit (ω) = [gi ] ∩ [φti ] ∩ Rit if ω ∈ [gi ] ∩ [φti ] ∩ Rit .
That is, Kit is deﬁned by Kit E = {ω ∈ Ω|Pit (ω) ⊆ E}.

A non-empty event H is said to be Pi - invariant if for every ξ of H, Pi (ξ) is
contained in H.
Fundamental lemma Let (Pi )i∈N be an RT-information structure with µ a
common-prior. Let X be an event and qi i’s posterior of X; that is, qi =
µ(X|Pi (ω)). If there is an event H such that the following two conditions (a),
(b) are true:
(a) H is non-empty and it is Pi -invariant,
(b) H is contained in [qi ] := {ω ∈ Ω | µ(X|Pi (ω)) = qi },
then we obtain that µ(X|H) = qi .
Proof. See Matsuhisa and Kamiyama [7].

Let ω∞ ∈ i∈N Ki∞ ([gi ] ∩ [φ∞
i ] ∩ Ri ) ⊆
i∈N ([gi ] ∩ [φi ] ∩ Ri ). The following
result is the another key to proving Theorem 1:

Proposition 1. In a pre-play communication-process among all the players in
a game with revisions of their conjectures {(φti )i∈N | t = 0, 1, 2, . . .}, both the

marginals of the conjectures φ∞
i and φj on A−i−j must coincide for all i, j ∈ N ;

that is, φi (a−i−j ) = φj (a−i−j ) for all a ∈ A.

Proof : It suﬃces to verify that q∞
i (a; ω) = qj (a; ω) for all (a; ω) ∈ A×Ω. Let us
ﬁrst consider the case that (i, j) = (s(∞), t(∞)). We denote by Π the partition
on Ω with which each component is deﬁned by Πi∞ (ω) = {ξ ∈ Ω | Pi∞ (ξ) =
Pi∞ (ω)} In view of the construction of {Pit }t∈T we can observe that Pi∞ (ω) is
Pj∞ -invariant; i.e., Pj∞ (ξ) ⊆ Pi∞ (ω) for all ξ ∈ Pi∞ (ω). It immediately follows
that Pi∞ (ω) is decomposed into a disjoint union of components Πj∞ (ξ) for ξ ∈
Pi∞ (ω); Pi∞ (ω) = k=1,2,...,m Πj∞ (ξk ) where ξk ∈ Pi∞ (ω). It can be observed

that µ([a = a]| Pi∞ (ω)) = k=1 λk µ([a = a]| Πj∞ (ξk )) for some λk > 0 with

By Fundamental lemma we note that µ([a = a]| Πj∞ (ξk )) =

and
thus
by the above equation it can be observed that for all ω ∈ Ω
q∞

there is some ξω ∈ Pi∞ (ω) such that q∞
i (a; ω) ≤ qj (a; ξω ). Continuing this
process according to the fair protocol the below facts can be plainly veriﬁed:

1. For every i = j, q∞
i (a; ω) ≤ qj (a; ξ) for some ξ ∈ Ω; and

2. qi (a; ω) ≤ qi (a; ξ) ≤ qi (a; ζ) ≤ · · · for some ξ, ζ, · · · ∈ Ω.
∞
Since Ω is ﬁnite the equation q∞
i (a; ω) = qj (a; ω) can be obtained for every
a, ω and for all i, j, in completing the proof.

Proof of Theorem 1. We denote by Γ (i) the set of all the players who directly
receive the message from i on N ; i.e., Γ (i) = { j ∈ N | (i, j) = Pr(t) for some t ∈
T }. For any subset I of N denote a−I := (ai )i∈N \I .
For each i ∈ N , we denote [gi ] ∩ [φ∞ ] ∩ R∞ by Fi . It is noted that Fi is
∞
a non-empty Pi -invariant set because ∅ = i∈N ([gi ] ∩ [φ∞
i ] ∩ Ri ) ⊆ Fi and

because Pi∞ (ω) ⊆ Fi for every ω ∈ Fi by the deﬁnition. We observe the ﬁrst
point that for each i ∈ N , j ∈ Γ (i) and for every a ∈ A,
µ([a−j = a−j ] | Fi ∩ Fj ) = φ∞
j (a−j ) :

(1)

∞
For, we note that Fi ∩ Fj ⊆ [φ∞
j (a−j )] and Fi ∩ Fj is Pj -invariant because
j ∈ Γ (i). Hence by Fundamental lemma (3), we plainly obtain (1) as required.
Then summing over a−i , we can observe that

µ([ai = ai ] | Fi ∩ Fj ) = φ∞
j (ai ) for any a ∈ A.

(2)

In view of Proposition 1 it can be observed that φ∞
j (ai ) is independent of the
choices of every j ∈ Γ (i).
We set the probability distribution σi on Ai by σi (ai ) := φ∞
j (ai ), and the
proﬁle σ = (σi ). We observe the second point that for every a ∈ i∈N Supp(σi ),
φ∞
i (a−i ) = σ1 (a1 ) · · · σi−1 (ai−1 )σi+1 (ai+1 ) · · · σn (an ) :

In fact, viewing the deﬁnition of σi we shall show that φ∞

the result is immediate. Suppose it is true for k ≥ 1. On noting the protocol is
fair, we can take the sequence of sets of players {Ik }1≤k≤n with the following
properties:
(a) I1 = {i} ⊂ I2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Ik ⊂ Ik+1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Im = N :
(b) For every k ∈ N there is a player ik+1 ∈

j∈Ik

Γ (j) with Ik+1 \ Ik = {ik+1 }.

We let take j ∈ Ik such that ik+1 ∈ Γ (j). Set Hik+1 := [aik+1 = aik+1 ]∩Fj ∩Fik+1 .
We note that Hik+1 is not empty because σi (ai ) = φ∞
j (ai ) = µ([ai = ai ] | Fi ∩
Fj ) > 0 in viewing of (2), and we note that Hik+1 is Pitk+1 - invariant which is included in [φ∞
ik+1 (a−j−ik+1 )]. It immediately follows from Fundamental lemma (3)
that µ([a−j−ik+1 = a−j−ik+1 ] | Hik+1 ) = φ∞
−j−ik+1 (a−j ). Dividing µ(Fj ∩ Fik+1 )
yields that µ([a−j = a−j ] | Fj ∩Fik+1 ) = φ∞
ik+1 (a−j )µ([aik+1 = aik+1 ] | Fj ∩Fik+1 ).
∞
t
In viewing of (1) and (2) it follows φj (a−j ) = φ∞
ik+1 (a−j−ik+1 )φj (aik+1 ); then
summing over aIk it immediately follows from Proposition 1 that φ∞
i (a−Ik ) =
∞
∞
φ∞
i (a−Ik −ik+1 )φi (aik+1 ). Viewing (4) we have just observed that φi (a−i ) =
∞
∞
φi (a−Ik+1 ) k∈Ik+1 \{i} φi (ak ), as required. Furthermore we can observe from
(4) that all the other players i than j agree on the same conjecture σj (aj ) =
φ∞
i (aj ) about j.
Each action ai with φ∞
i (ai ) > 0 for some j ∈ Γ (i) maximizes gi against
∞
∞
φi because ai = ai (ωi ), gi = gi (ωi ) and φ∞
i = qi (ωi ) at some state ωi of
Hi = [ai ] ∩ Fi ∩ Fj . Viewing (3) we conclude that each action ai appearing with
positive probability in σi maximizes gi against the product of the distributions
σl with l = i. This implies that the proﬁle σ = (σi )i∈N is a Nash equilibrium of
G. This establishes the theorem.

Concluding Remarks

Our real concern is with what learning process leads to a mixed strategy Nash
equilibrium of a ﬁnite strategic form game from the epistemic point view. As we
have observed, in the pre-play communication process with revisions of players’
conjectures about the other actions, their predictions induces a Nash equilibrium
of the game in the long run. Where the players privately communicate each
other through message according to any non-acyclic graph, and they are required
neither to have the common-knowledge assumption about their conjectures nor
to have a partition information structure.
The communication process treated in this article will give a new aspect of
the algorithms converging to Nash equilibrium from the epistemic point of view.
This issue needs to be sorted out at a more fundamental level, and it has not
been discussed at all. There is a research agenda of potential interest which we
hope to pursue further.
