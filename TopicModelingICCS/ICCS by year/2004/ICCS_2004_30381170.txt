Abstract. The joint estimation of linear and nonlinear state variables remains
challenging, especially in multiuser communications applications where the
state dimension is large and signal to noise ratio is low. In this paper, an
efficient Particle Filter (PF) is developed to make estimates of nonlinear time
delay parameters in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. The PF method has the
advantage that the importance weights are easily evaluated and the importance
density can be easily sampled. We propose a PF-based algorithm with
Resampling schemes for the estimation of closely-spaced path delays and
related coefficients in CDMA environments. Furthermore we present a number
of resampling schemes, namely: Multinomial Resampling (MR), Residual
Resampling (RR) and Minimum Variance Resamplings (MVR). The simulation
results show that MR scheme outperforms the other selection schemes. We also
show that it provides a more suitable method for tracking time-varying
amplitudes and delays in CDMA communication systems than RR and MVR
schemes.

1 Introduction
Nonlinearity in the measurement model has always been an obstacle for the reliability
of the estimation in the Kalman filtering structure. Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF)
approximates the a posteriori distribution to be Gaussian to simplify computation.
Recently the unscented transform(UT) has been used in an EKF framework, and the
resulting filter, known as the unscented Kalman filter, has been employed to tackle
the nonlinearity and shown its effectiveness in terms of the divergence reduction or
error propagation [1]. However, all the iterative solutions including Kalman filters
appeared in the literature necessarily assume that the unknown parameters are
Gaussian distributed.
In a CDMA environment which involves a joint channel coefficient and time-delay
tracking techniques, non-Gaussian properties of unknown parameters are inherently
taken. In this paper, the particle filter, recently introduced in the communication area,
which does not require the Gaussian assumption is employed for such an
exponentially distributed parameter like the propagation delay in the multipath
environment [2]. The PF results in better performance in the parameter (including

other channel coefficients) estimation [3]. We present PF with resampling techniques
to get around degeneracy problem occurring in the PF without resampling schemes.
Furthermore we demonstrate a number of resampling schemes, namely: Multinomial
Resampling (MR), Residual Resampling (RR) and Minimum Variance Resamplings
(MVR). The major contribution of this paper is to adapt the PF filter to the CDMA
parameter estimation in the highly nonlinear environments to make easy and practical
implementation by resampling techniques and to show performance comparisions
among resampling techniques..
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the signal and channel
model that will be used throughout the paper and a description of problem
formulation. Section 3 provides a description of PF and resampling schemes used for
parameter estimation. The simulation and results of the performance from computer
simulations are given in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides concluding remarks.

2 Problem Formulation

In DS spread-spectrum [2], the received baseband signal is given by

AWGN, n(l ) , is assumed to have zero mean and variance of σ n2 .

2.2 Problem Formulation

Given the received waveform samples, r (l ) , the task is to obtain minimum variance
estimates of the unknown parameters c k and τ k for k = 1,2,

The scalar measurement model follows from the received signal of (1) by
z (l ) = h(x(l )) + n(l )

The scalar measurement z (l ) is a nonlinear function of the state x(l ) . Hence, our
goal is to find the 2 K × 1 joint estimator E{x(l ) | R l } with estimated error covariance

3 Particle Filtering
3.1 Implementing the PF

A particle filter allows for a complete representation of the a posteriori distribution of
the states, so that any statistical estimates, such as the mean, modes, kurtosis and
variance, can be easily computed. They can therefore, deal with any nonlinearities or
distributions. Particle filters rely on importance sampling and, as a result, require the
design of proposal distributions that can approximate the a posteriori distribution
reasonably well. The most common strategy is to sample from the probabilistic model
of the states evolution. We are in a position to compute the particle filter algorithm
[1]. The basic procedure to construct a particle filter is shown below. The detailed
derivations are presented in [1] and [3]. The pseudo-code of a generic particle filter
can now be presented.

where

x0:t = {x0 , x1, , xt } and y1:t = { y1, y2 , , yt } , constitutes the complete solution to
the sequential estimation problem.
For example, letting g t (x 0:t ) = x 0:t yields the optimal MMSE estimate
| y ] . The particles x (0i:t) are assumed to be independent and
= E[ x

0 : t 1: t
identically distributed (i.i.d.) for the approximation to hold. It is usually difficult to
takes samples from given a posteriori distribution. Bayesian theory proves to result in
another useful concept, the proposal distribution, q (x 0:t | y1:t ) , for the Monte Carlo
Estimation calculation[1]. Here, the particle filters considered are three resampling
schemes. The PF algorithm can be easily derived from the SIS algorithm by an
appropriate choice of : (i) The importance density: q (xt | x(ki−) 1, y1:t ) is chosen to be the
xˆ

prior density p(x t | x t(i−)1 ) , and (ii) Resampling step: to be applied at every time index.
The above choice of importance density implies that we need samples from
p (x k | x (ki−) 1 ) . Thus, the importance weights evaluate w t(i ) = p ( y t | x t(i ) ) . As the

importance sampling density for the PF is independent of measurement y t , the state
space is explored without any knowledge of the observations. As resampling is
applied at each iteration, this can result in rapid loss of diversity in particles.
However, the PF method does have the advantage that the importance weights are
easily evaluated and the importance density can be easily sampled.

3.2 Resampling Schemes
The particle filters rely on sequential importance sampling (SIS). The SIS algorithm
discussed so far has a serious limitation: the variance of the importance weights
increases stochastically over time. To avoid the degeneracy of the SIS simulation
method, a resampling (selection) stage may be used to eliminate samples with low
importance weights and multiply samples with high importance weights. It is possible
to see an analogy to the steps in genetic algorithms [4]. A selection scheme associates
to each particle x 0(:it) a number of “children”, say N ∈ Ν , such that ∑i =1 N i = N .

Several selection schemes have been proposed in the literature. These schemes satisfy

obtain convergence results. So it is possible to design biased but computationally
inexpensive selection schemes. We will now present a number of selection or
resampling schemes, namely: Multinomial Resampling (MR), Residual Resampling
(RR) and Minimum Variance Resampling (MVR). We found that the specific choice
of resampling scheme affects the performance of the particle filter.

formly from the discrete set {x0:t ; i = 1, " , N} with probabilities {w
Gordon [6] gave a mathematical proof of this result. After constructing the cumulative
distribution of the discrete set, a uniformly drawn sampling index i is projected onto
the distribution range and then onto the distribution domain. The intersection with the
domain constitutes the new sample index j . That is, the vector x0( :jt) is accepted as
the new sample. Clearly, the vectors with the larger sampling weights will end up
with more copies after the resampling process.

this scheme, the variance (var( N i ) = N i wt′ (i ) (1 − wt′ (i ) )) is smaller than the one given
by the SIR scheme. Moreover, this procedure is computationally cheaper.
3.2.3 Minimum Variance Resampling
This strategy includes the stratified/systematic sampling procedures introduced in [5].
One samples a set of N points U in the interval [0, 1], each of the points a distance
N −1 apart. The number of children N i is taken to be the number of points that lie

4 Simulation
We now examine the performance of the PF for making parameter estimates for a
multiuser detector. We compare the PF-based estimator with among three resampling
schemes. The multipath coefficients of the channel can be generated using Clarke and
Gans Fading Model [8, Chap 4], which provides taps with the appropriate
distributions and near the correct tap autocorrelations, although the taps are somewhat
correlated. For simplification purposes, we consider no multipath. For the state model,
the augmented state transition matrix of (5) was chosen to be F = 0.999I . Also the
process noise covariance matrix was Q = 0.001I .

and x + x + x + x + 1 . The SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) at the receiver of
weaker user is 10dB. The Near-Far Ratio is 20dB. Oversampling factor (sample/chip)
is 2. The SNR for the weaker user is set at 10dB. One aspect about using PF is that
they require proper initialization. Depending on the problem, the initial guesses may
need to be close to the correct value for convergence. For the simulation results, we

assume such an initial estimator is used to start the tracking algorithm fairly close to
the true values. Furthermore, we note that the data bits, d k ,m , are not included in the
estimation process, but are assumed unknown a priori. In the simulations, we assume
that the data bits are available from decision-directed adaptation, where the symbols

The tracker for a two-user system is simulated for a fading channel where the
channel coefficients are time varying, but the delays remain constant. A simple
channel model is assumed for each user with a single tap (flat fading). Furthermore it
is assumed that each user is moving with a Doppler frequency of 200 Hz for User 1
and 300 Hz for User 2. The fading for in-phase and quadrature components of the the
channel coefficients for each user was implemented by IFFT and normalized so that
the average power is unity. The sampling time is taken as Tc = 1 /(1.2288Mbps × 2)
and The bit rate is assumed to be 1 / Tb = 9600bps with processing gain 31.

Fig. 2 shows the estimation error for channel coefficients and time delays with
imperfect power controlled using the Multinomial Resampling, Residual Resampling
and Minimum Variance Resampling, respectively. As the figure indicates, the
estimator/tracker with MR and RR is able to accurately track the time-varying
channel coefficients of each user, even for fast fading rates. But MVR is diverge. The
results for the same set of assumptions, but with a near-far ratio of 20dB are shown in
Fig. 3.
Again, the estimator is able to accurately converge to the correct values of the
parameters for both the MR and RR. But MR algorithm indicates to converge faster
RR.
It is seen that a user is able to accurately converge to the correct delays and channel
coefficient for PF with MR and RR scheme. PF with MR scheme indicates to
converge faster and it has smaller mean squared error (MSE).

5 Conclusions
We have presented a parameter estimator based on the RPF that are capable of
estimating channel coefficients and time delays in MAI (near-far ratio = 20dB). The
PF with MR has been demonstrated to have superior performance over RR and MVR
scheme. PF with MR can provide a better alternative to nonlinear filtering than RR or
MVR schemes since it possible to design selection schemes with lower variance.
Computer simulations also show that it provides a more effective technique for
tracking time-varying amplitudes and delays in CDMA communication systems than
RR and MVR. Furthermore the PF with MR estimator is shown to have the ability to
converge to the user’s true coefficients and time delays for a near-far ratio of 20 dB.
