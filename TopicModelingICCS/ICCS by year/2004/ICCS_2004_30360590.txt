Abstract. This paper proposes a handoff scheme to transmit multimedia
traffic based on the resource reservation procedure using direction estimation. The handoff requests for real-time sessions are handled based
on the direction prediction and the resource reservation scheme. In
simulation results, proposed method provides a better performance than
the previous method.

1 Introduction
As mobile users move around, the network must continuously track them down and
discover their new locations in order to be able to deliver data to them. Especially
wireless resources availability varies frequently as users move from one access point
to another [1, 2]. In order to deterministically guarantee QoS support for a mobile, the
network must have prior exact knowledge of the mobile’s path.
Majority of the previous schemes to support mobility make a reservation for resources in adjacent cells [3, 4]. The reserved resource approach offers a generic
means of improving the probability of successful handoffs by simply reserving the
corresponding resources exclusively for handoff sessions in each cell. The penalty is
the reduction in the total carried traffic load due to the fact that fewer resources are
granted to new sessions.

2 Proposed Structure
The base station reserves only the resources corresponding to the minimum transmission rate to the mobile. Based on the location and the direction of the mobile within a
cell, the resource reservation is performed with the following order: unnecessary state,
not necessary state, necessary state, and positively necessary state. If the reservation
variable for the mobile is changed, the reservation is canceled and the resources have
to be released with the reverse order and returned to the fool of available resource.
The set of the reserved resources have its priorities depending on whether it can be

allocated to new sessions or not: a real-time handoff session (priority 1), a non-realtime handoff session (priority 2) and a non-real-time new session (priority 3). This
strategy is explained in the following thing.
Resource Reservation ( )

If (Unnecessary State) then
The resource reservation needs not be performed;
else if (Not Necessary State) then
if (there are available resources in each of the estimated cells) then
Reserve the resources;
end if
If (enough resources are not available for a new session in the estimated
cells) then
The reserved resources is occupied by the new sessions;
end if
else if (Necessary State) then
if (no resources are available for the reservation in the estimate cell) then
Allocate and reserve the shared resources for a real-time session;
end if
If (there is no enough resource available to accommodate a new session in
the estimated cells) then
The reserved resources for real-time handoff sessions can be occupied
by non-real-time new sessions;
end if
else if (Positively Necessary State) then
if (no resources are available for the reservation in the estimate cell) then
Allocate and reserve the shared resources for a real-time sessions and
non-real-time sessions;
end if
If (there is no enough resource available to accommodate a new session in
the estimated cells) then
New sessions cannot occupy the reserved resources;

3 Performance Analysis
The simulation model is based on a B3G system proposed from ETRI, which is implemented using MOBILESimulatorV5. The simulation model composed of a single
cell, which will keep contact with its six neighboring cells. Each cell contains a base
station, which is responsible for the session setup and tear-down of new applications
and to serve handoff applications. The moving path and the mobile velocity are affected by the road topology. The moving pattern is described by the changes in moving direction and velocity. Fig.1 and Fig. 2 shows the variation in the dropping rates
in the different strategies when arrival rate of new session requests is increased. Results demonstrate that the dropping rate of the direction-based has decreased to about
20% and 15% for real-time and non-real-time sessions, as compared to the Fixedbased and dynamic-based, respectively. Handoff dropping rate for the dynamic
scheme is much better than that for Fixed.

4 Conclusions
This paper goal is to address the problem of guaranteeing an acceptable level of QoS
requirements for mobile users as they move from one location to another. This is
achieved through reservation variables such as the current location and the moving
direction that is presented with a set of attributes that describes the user mobility.
Based on reservation variables a scheme that provides predictive QoS guarantees in
mobile multimedia networks is proposed. We have focused in improving the overall
system performance.
