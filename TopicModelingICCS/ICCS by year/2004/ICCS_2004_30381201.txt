Abstract. Sensor networks consist of sensor nodes with small-size, low-cost, lowpower, and multi-functions to sense, to process and to communicate. Minimizing
power consumption of sensors is an important issue in sensor networks due to
limited power in sensors. Clustering is an efficient way to reduce data flow in sensor networks and to maintain less routing information. In this paper, we propose
a multi-hop clustering mechanism using global and local ID to reduce transmission power consumption and an efficient routing method to improve performance
of data fusion and transmission. Simulation results show that our algorithm can
increase life time and disperse power consumption among the nodes.

Introduction

Sensor networks consist of small size, low cost and low power sensor nodes with multifunctions to sense, to process and to communicate [1]. Minimizing power consumption
of sensors is one of the most important issues in sensor networks due to limited power
of sensor nodes. If a sensor node consumes all of its energy, the sensor network may
not guarantee reliable data transmission due to possible partition of the network. Thus,
algorithms to minimize nodes’ energy consumption and to maximize network life time
have been actively studied [1], [2], [3], [4].
Since each sensor node senses and transmits local proximity information, sensed
data in neighbor nodes tend to have similar characteristics to one another. In order to
reduce the amount of data for transmission, data with similar information of the nodes
need to be aggregated, which is called data fusion or aggregation [2]. The mechanism
with data fusion can lead to less energy consumption than the mechanism without data
fusion because data fusion reduces total data flow in the overall network. In general, it is
very difficult to optimize data fusion in sensor networks. So, the method to group sensor
nodes into a cluster and aggregate data in the cluster has been proposed in [3].
Clustering is able to reduce total routing messages as well as sensed information
data. However, the larger the size of a sensor network, the less the merit is. Hierarchical clustering can increase scalability, but this is more energy-consuming because data
transmission can concentrate on specific nodes or some routes, and total length of ID in
the header and routing table grows as the number of levels in the hierarchy increases.

In this paper, we propose a multi-hop clustering and algorithm for efficient data
fusion and routing using global ID, local ID and cluster scheduling instead of using
hierarchical clustering in order to reduce the number of cluster head (CH) nodes and
concentrated traffic on specific nodes.
Our algorithm has the following advantages:
1) Efficient data aggregation in a multi-hop cluster: In each aggregation procedure,
each node in a multi-hop cluster is allowed to transmit data only once by the cluster
schedule, which is more efficient than the aggregation in a hierarchical cluster because
some nodes in a hierarchical cluster may transmit data more than once.
2) Distribution of energy consumption when aggregating: In a hierarchical cluster,
fixed aggregating nodes exist (e.g., CH nodes) and energy consumption concentrates
on these nodes. Our algorithm extends single hop clustering and constructs multi-hop
clusters to distribute energy consumption over many aggregation nodes using cost of
local IDs.
3) Load balancing by construction of multipaths : Our algorithm constructs multipaths
from CH nodes to sink node during the multi-hop clustering stage. When aggregated
data are sent to the sink node, multipaths are used instead of the fixed single shortest
path to extend network life time.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss some of
the related works. In Section 3, we propose the mechanism with multi-hop clustering, ID
construction, routing path construction, and data aggregation. In Section 4, simulation
results and analysis are presented. Section 5 concludes the paper.

Related Works

Conventional routing protocols are not suitable to aggregate data and to maximize network life time in sensor networks due to sensor nodes’limited properties (e.g., bandwidth,
transmission range, thousands of nodes in a network, etc.). So, Low-Energy Adaptive
Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), which is a clustering-based protocol for sensor networks, has been proposed [3]. In LEACH, formation of clusters among sensor nodes is
conducted locally, and CH nodes compress local data of the nodes in their clusters to
reduce the amount of communications. And the role of CH nodes is periodically rotated
for distributing energy consumption. LEACH assumes that the base station (sink node)
is located far from the other nodes and each node can transmit data to the base station
directly. This assumption may not be suitable because of the limited capacity of sensor
nodes (especially, small energy). In this paper, we assume that the base station is located
at radio transmission distance as other normal sensor nodes. So, data transmission from
a normal node to the sink node traverses node along a routing path.
Power-Efficient GAthering in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS) is a chainbased protocol that minimizes power consumption [5]. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with close neighbor nodes and data are relayed to the sink node, thus
reducing the amount of energy spent. However, all nodes are assumed to have global
knowledge of the network, which is very difficult in real networks.
The hierarchical ad hoc routing is combined with clustering in sensor networks [10],
[11]. If the number of levels the in hierarchical clustering is large, less routing information

is required [6]. However, high levels of the hierarchy is more burdensome and leads to
long delay. Also, routing paths might be overlapped to transmit data as hierarchical level
increases and data are concentrated in CH nodes when aggregating data (see Fig. 1).
Hence, we propose and use multi-hop clustering structure, in which the distance is D
hop from CH node to the nodes in a cluster, to distribute energy consumption and reduce
routing overhead.

Proposed Multi-hop Clustering and Aggregate Routing
Multi-hop Clustering and Assignment of Node ID

Network life time, the time until the battery of any node drains-out for the first time,
depends on how to determine CH nodes, i.e., clustering algorithm. Since the purpose
of this paper is to realize efficient data aggregation and routing by use of local IDs for
sensor nodes in a cluster, we assume that CH node is determined according to each
node’s current residual energy.
When the power of randomly placed sensor nodes is on, each node can become a
CH node based on residual energy. If the remaining energy of a node is high, the node
set short random time to become a candidate for a CH node. The node that first claims
to be a CH node after random time becomes a CH node. A new CH node broadcasts
CH broadcast signal with the CH’s global ID, node ID, and the cluster’s schedule to its
neighbor nodes. The schedule of the cluster is based on the CH node’s start time (see
Fig. 2). Each node can know the transmission time at each level. Level i denotes the
number of hops from a CH to a node in the cluster.
Neighbor nodes, which receive the CH signal, write CH ID in their information table
(see Fig. 4 - (a)) and abandon being a CH node. These neighbor nodes may receive
other CH broadcast signals. Then, the nodes examine their own information table, and
select the CH with the smallest hop count and distance. Each node constructs a node
ID based on the selected CH node’s information and the node itself’s (see Fig. 3). If
a node determines its ID is within MAX hops from the CH, the node broadcasts CH
broadcast signal again to other neighbor nodes after specified time. Nodes receiving this
CH broadcast signal repeat the construction of information table with node ID.

Construction of Routing Paths

Intra-cluster routing from an intra-cluster node to the CH node: When each node
construct its information table with node ID, a node records the cost of the shortest
path to the CH and decides the routing path to the CH node. The construction of the
shortest path is similar to the Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) method. The difference
between DBF and our proposed intra-cluster routing method is that the proposed routing
mechanism can reduce the computational load of routing path (see Fig. 5).
Routing from a CH node to a neighbor cluster(NC): The border node, connected node
to a neighbor cluster, plays an important role in inter-cluster routing among CH nodes. If
a border node receives neighbor cluster’s CH broadcast signal, the border node transmits
information of the NC to its CH node. Nodes, which relay the information from the border
node to the CH node, record the hop count and the other information in the NC routing
table (see Fig. 4-(b)) and construct routing paths needed when the CH node transmits
data to other clusters’ CH nodes. Construction of the routing path from the border node
having information of NC to the CH node is similar to section 3.1 (see Fig. 6).
Inter-cluster routing from a CH to the sink node: Inter-cluster routing, which transmits aggregate data from a CH of a cluster to the sink node along the borer node of
NCs, employs the same routing mechanism as in conventional ad hoc networks except
replacing a node with a cluster. Routing paths determined from the previous step (see

information to transmit aggregated data to the sink node.

Data Fusion Procedure

Nodes in a cluster periodically sense their environment and sensed transmit information
to the CH node using intra-cluster routing paths. In the multi-hop clustering, the nodes
at MAX hop distance from the CH node (local MAX) start to transmit in the beginning
of aggregation, and the nodes at the next level transmit their own generated data and the
data received from other nodes. Each node in the cluster must transmit only once to a
neighbor node along the shortest path. However, data flow may be concentrated on some
nodes along the shortest path, which causes unnecessary energy consumption. So, we
propose the followings.
Level scheduling: When nodes start data aggregation, the nodes at MAX hop distance
(level D) to the CH node transmit data. For example, when nodes in level D are able
to transmit by the cluster schedule, which is informed in the clustering procedure, they
transmit data to one of the nodes in level D-1. Nodes in level D-1 combine their own
generated data with the received data, and transmit data again to the nodes in level D2 when the nodes in D-1 can transmit by the cluster schedule. In this way, nodes are

allowed to transmit to the nodes in lower level during their level period. Finally, the
CH node receives all of the nodes’ data in the cluster while each node is guaranteed to
transmit data only once.
Receiving node distribution: The nodes on the routing paths or receiving from many
sensor nodes rapidly consumes their energy. So, it may not minimize total power consumption if we select the next hop node according to the shortest path routing. We
propose two routing methods other than the shortest path. One is the random selection
method and the other one is the load balancing method. In random selection method, a
node transmitting data selects a random node among the nodes within the transmission
distance. This realizes the random distribution of receiving nodes simply, to reduce the
concentration of data to some nodes. The load balancing method selects receiving nodes
based on the probability determined from cost (e.g., energy, hop count). That is a node
can select a receiving node by considering the condition of both the node itself and candidate receiving nodes. For example,a node without enough energy to transmit data to a
node at the long distance, increases the probability of selecting a close receiving node.
In both methods, a receiving node is selected according to the level of a transmitting
node and the direction of transmission. In case of transmiting to the CH node, one of
the nodes at lower level is selected. In case of transmiting to an NC, one of the nodes at
higher level or in NC is selected (see Fig. 7 ).

Simulation Results

We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-hop
clustering and routing. The sensor network for the simulation consists of 50 ∼ 400 nodes
distributed randomly in the square area of 100 x 100 meters. The sink node is located
at the position (10,10). The proposed algorithm is used for inter-cluster routing and the
AODV [7] algorithm is used for intra-cluster routing. We use the same radio model as
in [8]. Signals regarding clustering and routing are assumed to be broadcast with the
maximum transmission range of 20m. Data are transmitted using modified RTS-CTSdata [9] as in wireless local area network. We also assume that there are no collisions and
bit errors by the cluster schedule when nodes transmit and receive data. Simulations are

executed until the network life time. The parameters in the simulation are summarized
in Table 1.
In Fig. 8, we observe that network life time of the proposed multi-hop clustering and
routing is almost the same regardless of routing methods to balance receiving nodes. The
reason is that all the data packets in a cluster must be eventually collected and transmitted
through the CH node to go to the sink node. So, in order to increase the network life
time, periodic reclustering may be required to switch CH nodes with those having larger
residual battery power. The shortest path routing, however, shows larger variance than
the other receiving node selection methods as shown in Fig 9. Basically, routing paths
constructed as in Section 3 is the shortest paths. Therefore, transmitting data in a cluster
tends to use the same routing paths and thus energy consumption is concentrated on the
nodes along the routing paths. In case of random and load balanced routing methods,
energy consumption is scattered to other nodes because transmitting nodes select the
next receiving node according to the remaining energy or the probability. We also note
that as the number of nodes increase, random selection surpasses the load balance since
the receiving nodes tend to be distributed evenly.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient aggregation and routing mechanism using local ID in multi-hop cluster sensor networks. The proposed algorithm can reduce
the routing computational overhead and simplify routing paths since it employs level
scheduling and intra- and inter-cluster routing. In addition, each node transmits data at
once in the aggregation procedure, preventing from unnecessary energy consumption
which has been in the previous works. We have compared the network life time and
energy consumption to evaluate the performance via simulations. The proposed load
balanced routing has been shown to disperse energy consumption by selecting the next
receiving node at random or by the load-balancing regime.
