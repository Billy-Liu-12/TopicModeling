Abstract. In this paper the method of computation of weak magnetic fields in
the presence of anisotropic shields it is described. The formulation is based on
vector magnetic potential and finite element formulation. Investigation of influence of anisotropic ratio on shielding effectiveness of low level magnetic fields
is investigated. At the end some illustrative example in 3D is given and numerical results are compared with experimental data.

1 Introduction
In the last time there is an increasing interest in low-frequency magnetic shielding.
Generally, the shielding effectiveness for low-frequency fields can be obtained by
solving Maxwell’s equations with appropriate assumptions and boundary conditions
[1]. However, the complexity of real shield and source geometries and the anisotropy
of the medium do not allow a solution to be easily obtained, unless numerical methods are exploited. Furthermore, even if an analytical solution can be achieved, it
might be so complex to be of no practical use for shielding design. Nevertheless, the
analysis of magnetic shields by standard numerical methods, for example, the finite
element method, gives sufficient tool for design of practical shields, especially when
the number of layers is low [2,3].
One means for reducing magnetic fields in given region is to make use of some
properties of materials, as a way for altering the spatial distribution of such fields
from field source. When a shielding magnetic material separates wires with currents,
that are sources for a magnetic field from regions, where reduction of field induction
B is required, the shielding sheets cause a change in the distribution of the magnetic
field, directing lines of magnetic flux away from the shielded domain [4].
A quantitative measure of the magnetic shield in reducing the magnetic induction
at a given place is the shielding coefficient. It is defined as the ratio of magnitude of
magnetic induction at given point when the shield is present, to the magnitude of
magnetic induction at the same point, when the shielding material is absent. In general shielding factor is a function of material properties, position at which it is measured, distance of the shield from the field source and magnitude of the excitation [5].

density within magnetic material, the shielding factor is dependent on excitation
value. Problem geometry also plays very important role, both from theoretical and
practical point of view [3].
Special difficulties arise in the case of shielding of weak magnetic fields. As it was
pointed in [1] by induction of the order of 10 µT ferromagnetic materials behave fast
as paramagnetics. As a result shielding effectiveness becomes very low. In [1] author
suggested to use anisotropy effect to increase shielding coefficient. He gives experimental data which show that such shielding method for very weak fields can be to
some extend effective.
In this paper author describes numerical simulation of anisotropic shielding of
weak electromagnetic fields in the case of magnetic field. The formulation is based on
vector magnetic potential. At the end some illustrative example is given.

2 Main Equations
Material equation for anisotropic magnetic material can be written in general form as:

B = µH

(1)

When spatial coordinate axes are chosen to be coincident with main anisotropic axes
of the magnetic material, the constitutive relation (1) has the form:

 Bx   µ1
B  =  0
 y 

  y  2 y
µ3   H z   µ3 H z 
0

(2)

It is assumed here that anisotropic axes overlap geometrical axes. Here µ1, µ2 and
µ3 are permeability coefficients for x, y, and z axes, respectively. This equation can be
written in simpler form as:
Bx = µ1 H x By = µ 2 H y Bz = µ3 H z

(3)

After introducing vector magnetic material A given by

B = rot A

(4)

and utilizing equations (3), vector components of magnetic field strength H have the
form:

Hx =

To solve the last three partial differential equations for vector potential A, standard
Galerkin’s nodal finite element method was used [5].

3 An Illustrative Example
As an illustrative example let us consider a rectangular current carrying wire with
rectangular cross section, which is shielded by ferromagnetic plate, as it is given in
fig.1. Rectangular wire is 400 mm wide in both x and y direction and wire cross section has value 10 × 10 mm. Over the wire in z direction there is a permeable plate,
which is 360 mm away from it.

The pate thickness is 1mm and it is 800 × 800 mm wide. Total current flowing in the
2
wire has value 200A, what gives current density J = 200A/cm . Relative permeabilities in y and z direction were in all simulation constant and had values µ2 = 5 and µ3 =
1, respectively. In order to explore an influence of anisotropy on magnetic field distribution over the plate only coefficient µ1 was changed. All simulations were carried
out for four µ1 values: 5, 35, 70 and 105. In all cases magnetic induction over the
shield was less then 60 µT, what means that only weak magnetostatic fields were
considered
Numerical simulation was carried out in full three dimensions where equations
(13) to (15) were solved. At distance 2000 mm from centre of the plate, potential A
and its partial normal derivatives were assumed to be 0. Whole calculation domain
was divided into 14280 tetrahedral finite elements with 67440 functional nodes, what
gives altogether 134888 unknowns. These equations were solved by standard iterative
method.

Results of computations are shown in subsequent figures. In figures 2 and 3 equipotential lines of a magnitude of the magnetic vector potential A are plotted. Fig.2
shows A for relative permeability in x direction µ1 = 5, that is when material is assumed to be isotropic and in Fig.3 for µ1 = 70. In both cases the plots are drawn over
a plate at distance 1mm in z direction.
In Fig.2 the equipotantial lines have circular shape cantered at plate middle point
while in Fig.3 one can see deformation of the magnetic field for the anisotropic case.
The field is scratched substantially in x direction.

Fig. 4. Z-component of a magnetic induction B along z axis for relative permeability µ1 = 70
(a)and z-component of a magnetic field strength H along z axis for different values of relative
permeability in x direction (b).

Fig.4a shows a plot of Bz along z axis for relative permeability µ1 = 70. On the parallel axis one can see symbolically depicted cross section of current carrying wire and
shielding plate. The greatest value of Bz is attained in middle of the rectangular wire,
as it is to expected. The value of Bz near shielding plate is about 100 lower as its
maximal value. Over the plate in z direction it decreases substantially. One has to
point out that on z axis there is only z component of the field because the x and y
components due to problem symmetry are equal zero.
In Fig.4b magnetic field strength Hz over the plate in z direction is shown. One can
see that for different permeability values the component Hz changes not substantially.
This is caused by the fact that shield is distant 360 mm from plate and for this value
of the strength, the field permeability is very low. Shielding effectiveness can be
increased substantially by placing the shield, where induction is much greater or by
increasing plate thickness.
Fig.5a shows plots of z component of a magnetic induction B over shielding plate
along z axis for different values of relative permeability. One also can see that
shielding effectiveness is low and increasing anisotropy does not cause substantial
decrease in Bz.
Fig.5b shows plots of in Bz along shielding plate in x direction and the changes of
its value for different permabilities. The sharp changes of curves are over the conducting wire. In the magnetostatic case the shielding is due only to flux shunting from
the region where decreasing of the field is required. This situation one can observe in
figures 2, 3, and 7. Increasing permeability both in x and y directions makes substantially shunting mechanism more effective.
The order of numerical errors can be assessed investigating, how chosen error indicator converges, when number of finite elements and also number of nodes increases. A good candidate for such error indicator can be deduced from Coulomb
gauge (17).

It states that magnetic vector potential field A is conservative, what means that in
computational domain there are not sources of this field. As consequence in ideal case
the total flux of this field through any close surface placed in computational domain
should be zero. Thus defining the error indicator in following way:
Error =

v∫ A ⋅ ds
S

v∫ A ⋅ n ⋅ d s

100%

(16)

S

where S is any closed surface and investigating how it changes with increasing value
of number of nodes, we can asses the numerical stability of the computational process. Of course, such defined error indicator is only necessary condition for convergence and not sufficient.

Because in shielding plate the filed changes most abruptly, as observation surface S

We can see that it decreases as number of elements and nodes increases, what assure
us that numerical process is convergent.

4 Conclusions
This paper gives descriptive methodology for anisotropic magnetic shielding that is
based on solution Maxwell’s equations for magnetostatic field in full three dimensions. First equations for vector magnetostatic potential A were formulated and subsequently gauge condition
div A = 0

(17)

implemented. The method is quite general and powerful. It provides a tool for computing the effectiveness of shield design based on anisotropic material properties and
geometric dimensions.
General conclusions from all calculation agree with that obtained experimentally in
[6, 7]. The shielding effectiveness for thin shielding plate is rather low.
