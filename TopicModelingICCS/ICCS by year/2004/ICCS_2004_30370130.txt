Abstract. This paper concerns an adaptive ﬁnite element method for
the elliptic obstacle problem. We consider the formulation of the problem
as an elliptic variational inequation. The adaptive algorithm (modiﬁed
Uzawa adaptive method)we construct is based on a combination of the
Uzawa method associated with the corresponding multivalued operator
and a convergent adaptive method for the linear problem. As our main
result we show that if the adaptive method for the linear problem is
convergent, then the adaptive modiﬁed Uzawa method is convergent as
well. A numerical experiment shows the studied properties of the method.

Introduction

Adaptive mesh reﬁnement based on a posteriori error estimates is an essential
instrument for eﬃcient numerical solving of Partial Diﬀerential Equations, in
particular nonlinear problems.
The obstacle problem may be considered as a model problem for variational
inequalities (see, e.g,[1],[2], [5], [6],[7] ). The obstacle problem belongs to a class
of problems which have found applications in such diverse ﬁelds as elasticity
and ﬂuid dynamics(see,e.g,[4],[5],[6],[7]). These problems are characterized by
free boundaries that are a priori unknown. An issue to consider is that in their
formulation the solution is sought in a convex and not necessarily linear subset
of some vector space.
In this paper we construct an adaptive ﬁnite element method for the elliptic
obstacle problem (adaptive modiﬁed Uzawa method). We formulate the variational inequality in terms of a multivalued operator. As it is well known, the
Uzawa algorithm consists in solving in each iteration a linear problem and a
nonlinear adaptation of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the multivalued
equation. As our main result we show that if the adaptive method applied for
the linear equation is convergent then, the adaptive modiﬁed Uzawa method is
convergent as well.
The convergence is proved with respect to a discrete solution in the space
corresponding to a suﬃciently reﬁned mesh. In order to assure the convergence of
the Lagrange multiplier, the space of piecewise constant ﬁnite element functions
is extended with bubble functions.

We get the following convergence result:
Main result. Let (Uj , Pj ) the sequence of ﬁnite element solutions of the linear problem and the corresponding Lagrange multiplier produced by the adaptive
modiﬁed Uzawa algorithm. There exist positive constants C and δ < 1 such that
u − Uj + |p − Pj | ≤ Cδ j
where | · | is the L2 (Ω) norm and · := |∇ · | is the energy norm; u and p are
the discrete solutions on a suﬃciently reﬁned mesh.
Several examples show the convergence of the method. The numerical experiments have been developed with the ﬁnite element toolbox ALBERT [11],
extended with new function basis including bubble functions.

Continuous Problem

Let Ω a bounded, polyhedral domain in Rd (d = 2, 3). L2 (Ω) the space of
Lebesgue-measurable functions that are square-integrable. Set W := H 1 (Ω) the
Sobolev space of functions in L2 (Ω) with weak derivatives of ﬁrst order in L2 (Ω).
V := H01 (Ω) is the subspace of W whose functions vanish on boundary ∂Ω. In
the following, (·, ·) denotes the inner product in L2 and < ·, · > the duality
pairing between the corresponding spaces. Moreover, consider the bilinear and
linear forms:
a(u, v) = (∇u, ∇v), < Au, v >= a(u, v), ∀u, v ∈ V

(1)

< F, v >= (f, v)

(2)

The rest of the data is given by a force density f ∈ L2 (Ω) and an obstacle
ψ ∈ W with ψ ≤ 0 on ∂Ω. The obstacle ψ is associated with the nonempty,
V-closed, and convex set of admisible displacements:
K := {v ∈ V|v ≥ ψ a.e. in Ω}

(3)

The continuous problem reads as follows:
Continuous Problem. Given Ω,f ,ψ as above, ﬁnd u ∈ K such that the following variational inequality holds:
a(u, v − u) ≥ (f, v − u) ∀v ∈ K

(4)

It is well known that the above problem admits a unique solution u, see, e.g.
[3]. The unilateral constraint u ≥ ψ yields a line singularity (free boundary) that
is the internal boundary of the contact set:
C := {x ∈ Ω : u(x) = ψ(x)}

(5)

The free boundary location is a priori unknown and a prime computational
objective.

Formulation with Multivalued Operator

Consider the functional on V that characterizes the convex K:
IK (v) =

0 v∈K
∞v∈
/K

(6)

The problem (4) is equivalent to: Find u ∈ V such that
Au + p = F in V

(7)

p ∈ ∂IK (u) in V

(8)

where ∂IK is the subdiferential of IK , which is a multivalued operator, and V
is the dual space of V. Set Πλ the Yosida approximation of ∂IK . The solution is
then characterized by the existence of p ∈ V, such that the pair (u, p) ∈ V × V
holds:
Au + p = F in V

(9)

p = Πλ (u + λp) in V

(10)

The operator Πλ = λ1 (Id − PK ), where PK is the projection operator on K.
Moreover, Πλ is a Lipschitz operator with constant 1/λ

Discretization

Let Th be a uniformly regular triangulation of Ω characterized by the diameter
h. Let Vh ⊂ V indicate the space of continuous piecewise linear ﬁnite element
functions and extended with the bubble functions over Th , i.e., Vh := {vh ∈
¯
C 0 (Ω)|
∀T ∈ Th , vh|T ∈ P1 (T ) + B(T )}, where B(T ) is generated by the
product λ1 λ2 λ3 of the barycentric coordinates. Let Mh ⊂ L2 (Ω) be the space of
piecewise constant ﬁnite element functions over Th .
We consider the operator Πλ,h = λ1 (Id − PKh ), where Kh is a suitable approximation of K, that is, Kh = {q ∈ Mh | q|T ≥ ψ(bT ) ∀T ∈ Th }, being bT
the barycentre of T . The discrete problem reads as follows:
Find (uh , ph ) ∈ Vh × Mh such that
Auh + Rt ph = F

(11)

ph = Πλ,h (Ruh + λph )

(12)

where R denotes the orthogonal projection operator in L2 (Ω) norm from Vh
onto Mh and Rt is its transposed operator.
The Uzawa algorithm iterations are written:
For any ph (0) ,obtained ph (i−1)
Auh (i) = F − Rt ph (i−1)
ph

(i)

= Πλ,h (Ruh

(i)

+ λph

(13)
(i−1)

)

It is well known that the above algorithm is convergent: for some λ > 0 we
have
lim uh (i) − uh = 0

i→∞

(15)

Remark 1. Notice that the above algorithm may be considered as a ﬁxed point
iteration for the application deﬁned over Mh :
q → Πλ (λ(I −

1
RA−1 Rt )q + RA−1 F )
λ

(16)

Since Vh and Mh are ﬁnite dimensional spaces and Vh has bubble functions,
the kernel of Rt is null. Thus, the application
Mh → R
q → |Rt q|
deﬁnes a norm in Mh .We can now choose λ such that:
1
|I − RA−1 Rt | = 1 − β(h) < 1
λ

(17)

hence,
|ph i − ph | ≤ (1 − β(h))|ph i−1 − ph |

(18)

lim β(h) = 0

(19)

and
h→0

Adaptive Algorithm

In this section we describe the adaptive-modiﬁed Uzawa method. To simplify
notations let us assume that Tj stands for the mesh obtained from Tj−1 by
reﬁning and the corresponding sets of ﬁnite element functions are denoted by
(Vj , Mj ) and (Vj−1 , Mj−1 )). Consider a pair of successions:
V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Vj ⊂ Vj+1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ VJ = Vh
M0 ⊂ M1 ⊂ . . .⊂ Mj ⊂ Mj+1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ MJ = Mh
For any P0 ∈ M0 , ε0 > 0, 0 < γ < 1. Given Pj−1 ∈ Mj−1 , let uj ∈ VJ denote
the solution of
a(uj , v) =< F, v > −(Pj−1 , v) ∀v ∈ VJ

(20)

An adaptive FEM method is applied to ﬁnd Uj ∈ Vj such that
Uj − uj ≤ Cεj , |(Rj − RJ )Uj | < Cεj
where εj < γεj−1 . This procedure is denoted by

(Tj , Uj ) ← ELLIPTIC(Tj−1 , Uj−1 , εj , f )

(22)

We, ﬁnally, actualize the multiplier:
Pj = Πλ,j (Rj Uj + λPj−1 )

(23)

The following box describes the algorithm:

With the hypothesis above, we have the following convergence theorem for
the algorithm:
Theorem 1. There exist positive constants C and δ < 1 such that the iterative
solutions (Uj , Pj ) produced by the adaptive-modiﬁed Uzawa method satisfy:
uJ − Uj + |pJ − Pj | ≤ Cδ j

(24)

where (uJ , pJ ) ∈ VJ × MJ denote the solution of the problem (11)-(12).
Sketch of the proof in the case ψ = 0:
Pj = Πλ,j (Rj Uj + λPj−1 ) =
= Πλ,j (RJ uj + λPj−1 + RJ (Uj − uj ) + (Rj − RJ )Uj )

(25)
(26)

The solution uj of (20) may be written as uj = A−1 (F − RJt Pj−1 ). Observe that
in the case ψ = 0 we have Πj (z) = ΠJ (z) if z ∈ Mj . Hence
Pj = Πλ,J (λ(I −

1
RJ A−1 RJt )Pj−1 + RJ A−1 F + RJ (Uj − uj ) + (Rj − RJ )Uj )
λ
(27)

If we write pJ , the solution of (12), as follows
1
pJ = Πλ,J (λ(I − RJ A−1 RJt )pJ + RJ A−1 F )
λ

(28)

Then, subtracting (27) and (28), applying norms, we ﬁnd an upper bound, for
diﬀerent constants C

As in [9], by induction arguments we obtain
|pJ − Pj | ≤ |pJ − P0 |η j +

λ

(29)

where η = max{(1 − β(h)), γ} and η < δ < 1.
To ﬁnd an error bound for uJ − Uj , observe that
uJ − uj ≤ C|pJ − Pj |. Hence,
uJ − Uj ≤ uJ − uj + uj − Uj ≤ C(|pJ − Pj | + εj )

(30)

which proves the result.
For the case ψ = 0 we need to add |ψ − ψj | < Cεj to the condition (21)
where ψj is the interpolated function in Mj .

Numerical Experiment

Consider Ω = {x ∈ R2 : x < 1}, f (x) = 0, and ψ(x) = max{0, 1 − 4 x },∀x ∈
Ω. The solution of the problem u(x) = 1 − x , for all x ∈ Ω and C(u) = {0}
Let us assume an initial triangulation T0 of Ω, and the posteriori error estimate
u − uh ≤ η(uh ) = (

ηT (uh )2 )1/2

(31)

T ∈T0

where(see [10] for H 1 error estimate for the linear problem −∆u = f (x))

If tol is a given allowed tolerance for the error, and η(uh ) > tol, we reﬁne the
mesh while η > tol. For the Maximum strategy (see [11]), a threshold γ ∈ (0, 1)
is given, and all elements T ∈ Tj with
ηT > γ max ηT
T ∈T

are marked for reﬁnement.
Set γ = 0.8, ε0 = tol = 1.0 and the Yosida parameter λ = 1.0. Figure 1
shows the behaviour of the true error in H 1 −norm as a function of the number
of uh -degrees of freedom (DOF). We observe the improvement in applying our
adaptive method (in solid linestyle) compared with the results obtained with
uniform reﬁnement (in dashed linestyle). Figure 2 shows mesh in the ﬁnal step
and the solution isolines.

Conclusions

We have developed an adaptive Uzawa algorithm to solve the obstacle problem
which is a modiﬁcation of the classical Uzawa method. We justify the use of a
a-posteriori error estimation from the linear elliptic problems for this kind of
non-linear problems. The numerical results asserts the validity of the theoretical
analysis and the eﬃciency of the algorithm. A better improvement should be
obtained with a ﬁnest control of the interpolation error of the obstacle function
ψ. This will be done in a future research.
