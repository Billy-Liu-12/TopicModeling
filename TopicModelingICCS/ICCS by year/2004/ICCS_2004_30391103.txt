Abstract. The geometric construction of bio-kinetic apparatus of man’s
locomotion representation in cybernetic form is actual task. It is very important
for motion design and locomotion coordination (control) tasks solving. For this
aim the hierarchical multilevel systems construction was chosen and applied in
this paper for bio-kinetic apparatus of man description. The hierarchical
multilevel systems coordination method realisation in geometric design of
man’s locomotion is also presented in the paper.

1 Geometric Representation of Bio-kinetic Apparatus
Construction
Geometrical construction of men in our case is regarded as a set of bio-kinetic chains
and limbs. It can be presented as hierarchical multilevel system by Mesarovi and
Takahara [1] in form of aed [3-6] ( aed is an ancient Greek word):
g

S A = {ω A , S0A , σ A }

(1)

where:

ωA -

aggregated dynamic realisation (model), which represents the construction
(body and bio-kinetic chain) of men as the unit in its environment;

σA-

geometric construction of a bio-kinetic apparatus;

S - coordinator, which connects σ with ω and in this way, coordinates the
A
0

locomotion process.
A - index of level.

ωA

is described with the help of dynamic systems

( ρ ,ϕ ) [2]:

ρ A = {ρ t : Ct × X t → Yt & t ∈ T }A ,
ϕ A = {ϕ tt ' : C t × X tt ' → C t ' & t , t '∈ T & t ' > t}A

and coordinates the locomotion process on its layers of choice, learning and selforganisation. All metrical characteristics of bio-kinetic apparatus (relational angles,
length of limbs etc.) are described by numeric positional systems – numerical
characteristics.

2 Coordination Method Realization in Design of Men’s
Locomotion
Geometric design process (motion design) of two-legged locomotion of man contains
two stages and executed by coordinator [11]:
– Synthesis (creation) of geometric construction of bio-kinetic men’s
apparatus;
– Motion design and evaluation of kinds (states) of men locomotion (walk, run
and others).
On the first stage coordinator
geometric elements

ω A −1 of

S 0A realise (on its choice layer) the synthesis of

bio-kinetic apparatus and after that connects the
A

elements by their structural common parts σ U – joints. In this way the synthesis
process of structure of whole bio-kinetic apparatus of man is realised. This process
may be described as follows:

regarded.
Men’s environment can be heterogeneous in general case, for instance it is
possible to have an obstacles on the trajectory of motion. That is why, coordinator
realises its several coordination strategies while walking – from the strategy of full
determination (the trajectory is known, the external state (state of the environment) is
also known) to the coordination strategy of full information uncertainty – the
trajectory is uncertain (motion in unknown environment); the absence of the
possibility to receive the information about the state (structure) of both the path and
environment. For instance, in case of man locomotion in conditions of full darkness.

There are deformations in bio-kinetic apparatus which cause (during locomotion
process) the coordinated movements of its parts – hands and legs: flexion,
straightening, inclination (bending), swing. The change of the connections

σ

U A of

above mentioned elements, which are the parts of bio-kinetic apparatus structure σ
we will recognise as deformations. The coordinator task in motion design is to
provide the cohered motion of bio-kinetic apparatus and deformations of its elements,

i.e. σ U .

Structural connections in geometrical sense are the angles between parts of biokinetic apparatus (fingers, foot, led). So, coordinator task is to change continuously
these angles to provide the locomotion process. Formally, the task solving is
presented in following form:
- for coordinator (as its reaction): ρ 0

- for system (as state transition):
where

are the state of bio-kinetic apparatus structure at moments of time

t and t’ correspondingly, t’>t;

σ

U ttA ' is the change of angles during the period of time

tt’, is the state of bio-kinetic apparatus structure at moment of time t’ and t’>t. The
dependence of the angle changing in locomotion process is reflected in [7].
In this case we deal with the biomechanical type of motion for which the next
dependence is true:
τω

U A T t tA′ = const .

have their directions in dependence of the element address in the environment, in
accordance with which the present process is regarded.

3 Conclusion
In comparison with known methods [8-10] the proposed coordination one describes
the bio-kinetic apparatus of man as hierarchical multilevel system, that allows to solve
the design task of man locomotion as interconnections coordination of cohered
structural and dynamical representation of apparatus.
In known methods the general rotation angles of limbs (as kinematical
mechanism) in 3-D space are calculated. In proposed one we regard the relative
angles between limbs as their interconnections only. It allows reduce the number of
calculations.
During the motion design processes the dependence of functional parameters
(kinds of motions) from structural ones (sizes, angles etc.) of bio-kinetic apparatus
elements while walking was established (determined).
Computer program is written on Pascal and implemented on the simplest PC
what allows to solve the task fast with minimal computer memory and speed.
