Abstract. One of the central problems in ﬁnancial markets is to make
the proﬁtable stocks trading decisions using historical stocks’ market
data. This paper presents the decision-making method which is based on
the application of neural networks (NN) and swarm intelligence technologies and is used to generate one-step ahead investment decisions. In brief,
the analysis of historical stocks prices variations is made using “single
layer” NN, and subsequently the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm is applied in order to select ”global best” NN for the future
investment decisions and to adapt the weights of other networks towards
the weights of the best network. The experimental investigations were
made considering diﬀerent number of NN, moving time intervals and
commission fees. The experimental results presented in the paper show
that the application of our proposed method lets to achieve better results
than the average of the market.

Introduction

The continuing improvements of computer technologies, telecommunication services’ grow make a big inﬂuence on globalization of stock markets and more
eﬃcient its information processing tools are required. The complexity and ”noisiness” of stock markets cause diﬃculties in making real time analysis of it and
forecasting its changes in the future. It was proved that having complex systems
a collection of individuals often solves a problem better than an individual even an expert [1]. Individuals acting within ”a swarm” interact with each other
in order to solve a global objective in a more eﬃcient manner than a single
individual could [8].
The main objective of this paper is to develop the method based on artiﬁcial
intelligence tools, which includes artiﬁcial NN, swarm intelligence technologies
(particle swarm optimization), and apply it for the decisions-making in stocks’
trading markets.
PSO algorithm is one of the swarm intelligence algorithms. It is a populationbased search algorithm based on the simulation of the social behavior among
individuals (particles) ”moving” through a multidimensional search space. Each
particle of the swarm represents a candidate solution to the optimization of the
problem. While each particle is ”ﬂown” through the multidimensional search

space it is adjusting its position in search space according to its own experience
and that of neighboring particles [3]. The PSO is closely related to evolutionary
computation and artiﬁcial life (A-life) in general. The same as evolutionary programming it is highly dependent on stochastic processes. The optimizer which
is used in the PSO algorithm, while making adjustment towards ”local” and
”global” best particles, is conceptually similar to the crossover operation used
by genetic algorithms [8]. As well PSO includes ﬁtness function, which measures
the closeness of the corresponding solution to the optimum. The same function
is included in the paradigms of evolutionary computation. The main diﬀerence
of PSO concept from the evolutionary computing is that ﬂying potential solutions through hyperspace are accelerating toward ”better” solutions, while in
evolutionary computation schemes operate directly on potential solutions which
are represented as locations in hyperspace [7].
The problem of stock markets forecasting was analyzed by many researchers
in the past. Considerable eﬀorts have been put into investigation of stock markets
changes and creating its forecasting systems. There are not so many examples
of Swarm Intelligence applications for the solving of this problem. However, the
published examples of swarm intelligence applications seem to be promising and
give good results. In paper [10] there is proposed the forecasting methodology
for the daily exchange rates of Japanese Yen against the US Dollar and of the
US Dollar to the British Pound. The proposed forecasting methodology includes
clustering technology, artiﬁcial NN and evolutionary computing. In contrast to
this paper we focus on the formation of recommendations while making investment decision in stocks’ markets. As well we are working with a large data set
that lets us to propose more stable investment decision system. In paper [2] the
authors are focusing on adapting PSO to dynamic environments. This paper is
more focused on the modiﬁcations of PSO algorithm, while our goal is to introduce the investment decision-making method where PSO will be only one
constituent of it.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the problem and describes the proposed method; Section 3 is devoted for the implementation of
PSO algorithms; In Section 3 the experimental results are discussed. The main
conclusions of the work are presented in Section 4.

Description of Proposed Method

The analysis and forecast of stock market variations is stickler, because of its
complexity and noisiness. There is not enough to use conventional techniques to
conduct the stock markets predictions, as its changes are inﬂuenced by stochastic human factors, nonlinear, multivariable and temporal nature of stock price
transitions. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence had made a big inﬂuence on the
forecasting and investment decision-making technologies and it was proved that
the eﬃcient results can be obtained [4], [6]. In this paper we are proposing a
decision making method, which is based on the study of historical data, the use
of NN and PSO algorithm.

Stocks’ Trading System

In experimental investigations we are using 350 stocks, which are taken from
the list of SP500 index. The data set represents stocks’ price changes for 12
years (01/Oct/91-01/Oct/03). In our method we are using ”single layer” NN,
with the designation ”single layer” referring to the output layer of computation
nodes (neurons). The signals (data set) are passed to the cell body. Once they
reach it, they are combined additively. The net result is a linear combination
of each of the weighted input vectors. The NN’ weights are initialized randomly
at the beginning of the procedure. The random numbers are kept small, and
symmetrical about zero. In the investigations there are considered stocks’ prices
changes for 5 days. The changes of 5 days were taken making an assumption
that such stocks’ prices changes have the highest correlation with the next day
stocks price change [11]. For example, if stocks’ price changes of ﬁve days are
negative, there is a high possibility that the price of these stocks will increase
on the next day and vise versa. Further, for each day, and each stock the recommendations are calculated using diﬀerent number of ”single layer” NN and
taking into account prices changes of diﬀerent number of days. The net result
is passed to the hyperbolic tangent function and the recommendations for the
stocks’ trading are calculated. The recommendations represent the relative rank
of investment attraction to each stock in the interval [−1, 1]. The values −1, 0
and +1 represent recommendations: sell, hold and buy respectively. After the
recommendations are calculated, all the stocks are sorted in the descending order. Having sorted stocks we are taking into account 3 stocks (for each day) that
have the highest recommendations. Further, the observation of these stocks price
changes behavior on the next day is made considering diﬀerent length moving
time intervals. This observation lets us to see how good results could we get making the decisions according to the price changes of the stocks with the highest
recommendations. The next step in our method is the use of PSO algorithm and
the selection of ”global best” particles, which will be used for the calculations of
expected proﬁt. The more detailed explanation of PSO algorithm is presented
in the next section.

Application of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

In this paper our objective is to apply the PSO algorithm, which is based on the
search of ”global best” particle. Here particles are represented as ”single layer”
NN. So called ”global best” particle is chosen for every day taking into account
the chosen moving time interval, it means that every day we are comparing the
performance (ﬁtness function) of NN and the network with the highest performance is chosen for further experimental investigations. The adaptation of the
other particles weights is made towards the weights of ”global best” particle.
Such adaptation of weights and training of NN let us to move towards the best
solution as all the time the trading decision are made using NN that have shown
the best performance. Knowing the day and NN, which performance was the
best on that day, we are selecting 3 stocks with the highest recommendations.
Further the calculation of the prices’ change mean of 3 stocks with the highest

846

recommendations is made. We believe that the investigation of stocks with the
highest recommendations will let to achieve the best gain on the next trading
day. More detailed explanations of experimental investigations are presented in
the next Section.

Experimental Investigations

The realization of our proposed method was made using MATLAB software
package. All our made experimental investigations could be described in several
functional steps:
1. Stocks’ prices relative changes (%) for the time period 01/Oct/91–01/Oct/03
were calculated.
2. The recommendations for the purchase of the stock were formed using ”single
layer” NN.
3. All the recommendations were sorted and for every day three stocks with
the highest recommendations were chosen.
4. The price changes of chosen stocks on the next day were explored.
5. There were calculated expected day proﬁts, taking into account the price
changes of chosen stocks and the proﬁt estimations was made selecting different moving time intervals. This proﬁt was calculated as a sum of stock
prices changes (%).
6. The PSO algorithm was applied and the proﬁt estimation based on the search
of ”global best” particles was made.
7. In parallel there was estimated the proﬁt, making an assumption that the
investments were made into SP500 index.
8. The experiments were run taking into account diﬀerent number of NN and
diﬀerent size moving time intervals in order to ﬁnd the situations when the
best and the most stable results could be achieved.
4.1

Selection of Moving Time Interval and Number of Neural
Networks

The ﬁrst part of experimental investigations was focused on the choice of optimal number of NN and on the choice of the size of moving time interval. The
experiments were run taking into account diﬀerent size moving time intervals
and diﬀerent number of NN. The number of explored stocks and days was the
same for all the cases. In these experimental investigations the commission fee
for selling and buying stocks was not considered. The obtained results let us to
make several conclusions:
– The bigger number of NN, with diﬀerent initial weights, let us to achieve
more stable results (see Fig. 1 and 2).
– The bigger moving time intervals let to avoid unnecessary variations and to
achieve better results (see Fig. 3).

– The experimental investigations showed that the best results are achieved
while taking 30 NN and the moving time interval of 100 days.
From the Fig. 1 and 2 it can be seen that the swing of the results is much
smaller when there were taken 30 NN. As well the experimental investigations
showed that the results are inﬂuenced by the choice of moving time interval size.

Fig. 4. The swing of NN depending
from the moving time interval

As it can be seen from the Fig. 3, the proﬁt is growing while increasing
moving time intervals. The variations of the proﬁt become more stable while
having moving time intervals from 70 to 100 days (see Fig. 4). The Fig. 4 shows
that having moving time interval of 100 days (solid line) the swing between NN
(having 30 NN) is much smaller than having the moving time interval of 10

days (dashed line) or 50 days (bold line). Here the swing of NN is meant to be
the choice of diﬀerent “global best” NN depending from the time period. For
example: having moving time interval of 100 days (solid line) we can see that
starting from the 1st day and until the 38th day the “global best” NN is 20th,
while during the same time period, having moving time intervals of 10 and 50
days the “global best” NN are changing almost every 3rd or 5th days. The results
could be even more increased taking into account more NN and bigger moving
time interval. In this paper there were not made such experimental investigations
because of the limited computer capacity.
The comparison of proﬁt estimation results using our proposed method (having 30 NN and moving time interval of 100 days) and results achieved while
making investments into SP500 index are presented in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Comparison of the results

As it can be seen from the Fig. 5 the application of PSO algorithm gives
very good results. The proﬁt accumulation results are 5–7 times better than
the results achieved making investments into SP500 index. The obtained results
conﬁrm that using our method and not paying any commission fee we are able
to beat the market. The good results are achieved as every day, while making
the desicion, there is made an adaptation of particles’ weights to the weights of
”global best” and this lets to position all the particles towards the ﬁtness of best
particle.
4.2

The Estimation of Proﬁt Considering Account Commission Fee

In the second part of experimental investigations we were focusing on the estimation of the proﬁt considering commission fee. In the ﬁrst part of experimental
investigations we have got results showing, that having 30 NN, moving time interval of 100 days and not considering commission fee we are able to get 0.2344

% average incomes per day. The analysis of the commission fees of diﬀerent ebrokers showed that commission fee in real trading process is usually between
0.15 % – 0.3 %. For example, such transition fees are provided by the company of
Interactive Brokers [5]. Having bigger selling and buying volumes this fee could
be even smaller - 0.1 %. Based on that for further investigations we are considering the commission fee which is equal 0.15 %. We are making an assumption
that on the ﬁrst trading day we are investing 1000 $ into the market. Each day
we are paying 0.15 % of commission fee for buying new stocks. The value got on
the last investigated trading day is considered as the proﬁt. For the trading of
SP500 index the commission fee is not considered. The experimental investigations showed that having the commission fee of 0.15 % we are able to earn more
than the average of the market (see Fig. 6).

The situation is changing while the commission fee is increasing (see Fig. 7).
While having the commission fee of 0.2 % we are already slightly loosing compare to the proﬁt that has been got from the investment into SP500 index. The
experimental investigations show, that using our proposed method are able to
win only big funds that have a possibility to pay small (0.15 %) commission fees
for buying and selling stocks. The experimental investigations have showed that
the results, achieved while applying our proposed method, are much better as it
was got using NN for the investigation of similar time series and its future changes forecasting [9],[12]. However, the proposed method still has to be improved
in order to achieve better results while considering bigger commission fees.

ring historical data of stocks’ price changes. The experimental investigations let
as to make the following conclusions:
1. The bigger number of NN and longer moving time interval let us to achieve
better and more stable results.
2. The proﬁt accumulation results, while not considering any commission fees,
were 5–7 times better than the results achieved making investments into
SP500 index.
3. Taking into account the commission fee of 0.15 % the proposed method gives
better results than the average of the market.
4. The bigger commission fees (around 0.2 %) reduce the results and the investment into SP500 index becomes more reasonable.
5. The propose method could be useful for big ﬁnancial funds that are able to
pay small commissions fees for buying and selling stocks.
In the future we intend to make more detailed analysis of our proposed
method.
