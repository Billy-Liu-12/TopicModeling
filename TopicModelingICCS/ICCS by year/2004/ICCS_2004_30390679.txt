Abstract. Evolution is a tinkerer not an engineer: the term exaptation
was coined to signify that old structures, that could be not signiﬁcant
in terms of ﬁtness, get re-used when environmental conditions changed.
Here I show that the average protein composition of G+C rich bacteria
were exapted to the switch from anaerobic to aerobic conditions. Because
the proteome composition is under the strong control of directional mutation pressure, this is an example of exaptation at the molecular level
for which the underlying mechanism is documented.

Introduction

During the last 20 years, genomic sequence data have been produced in a exponential way, with a doubling time close to 18 months, reminiscent of Moore’s law
in computer sciences (Fig. 1). We don’t know whether this is just an anecdotical
coincidence or evidence that the limiting factor for the production of genomic
sequence data is related to computer performances, although the latter interpretation is my favorite given the perpetual struggle for disk space we are facing in
my laboratory just to store primary data.
Whatever the underlying reason for this doubling time, we have a huge amount of data available and the problem is how to make sense from this. This paper
is an example, admitly modest, of what is called data mining, or post-mortem
data analysis, in which I have used previously published results to interpret
them my own way. This paper is basically an attempt to make a connection between two previously published results that are summarized thereafter to provide
background material.
1.1

Some Biological Terms

– Bacteria: this is a subset of living organisms on Earth. It is used here in
its broad sense (i.e. Archae + Eubacteria) to designate small unicellular
organisms without complex subcellular structures such as a nucleus.

Fig. 1. The exponential growth of genomic sequence data mimics Moore’s law. The
source of data is the december 2003 release note (realnote.txt) from the EMBL database available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/. External lines correspond to what would be
expected with a doubling time of 18 months. The central line through points is the
best least square ﬁt, corresponding to a doubling time of 16.9 months.

– Aerobic bacteria: is used here to designate bacteria that can live only in
presence of oxygen in their environment.
– Anaerobic bacteria: is used here to designate bacteria that can live only in
absence of oxygen in their environment.
– Exaptation. Modern evolutionary theories are all based on Markov processes in which the future is inﬂuenced by the past only through the present
state. To avoid using the term preadaptation, that would be misleading in
this context as it may suggest some kind of knowledge of the future, Gould
and Vrba have introduced the term exaptation [1]. This term is used to designate features of organisms that are non-adapted, but available for useful
cooptation in descendants.
1.2

Genomic G+C Content and Aerobiosis

The G+C content is an example of global genomic structure that was used early
in bacterial taxonomy, i.e. before the genomic era, because it was possible to
estimate its value experimentally without knowing the sequence of a genome. The
G+C content of bacterial chromosomes is the molar ratio of bases G and C over
all bases, so that we could express this by the following lines of R implementation
[2] of the S language:
> urn <- c("A", "C", "G", "T") # the bases in DNA
> dna <- sample(urn, size = 1000, replace = TRUE) # simulated DNA

Life History Traits and Genome Structure

681

> gc.content <- function(dna) {
length(dna[dna == "G" | dna == "C"])/length(dna)
}
> gc.content(dna) # should be close to 0.5 in this case
[1] 0.467
Observed values range from 0.25 to 0.75 in bacteria and this was interpreted
early as the result of diﬀerences in mutation rates between AT and GC pairs
(see [3] and references therein). In the last 40 years, all the attempts to ﬁnd
an adaptative value for the G+C content of bacterial chromosome have failed,
for instance there is no connection with the optimum growth temperature of
bacteria [4] despite one may have expected from the extra hydrogen bond in GC
pairs as compared to AT pairs.
Recently, Naya et. al. showed [5] that the G+C content is undoubtedly higher
in aerobic bacteria than in anaerobic bacteria, linking for the ﬁrst time a genome
structure and a life history trait, and then raising the exciting possibility of a
non-zero impact of the genomic G+C content on the cell ﬁtness in bacteria.
This kind of relationship between a genome structure and a life history trait
is typically what makes sense for biologists because they are always looking for
evidences of adaptation. Strickly speaking aerobiosis is not a life history trait per
se but through its consequences because growth in aerobic conditions is much
more eﬃcient than in anaerobic conditions, allowing for smaller generation times.
1.3

Protein Metabolic Cost in Aerobic Conditions

Recently, Akashi and Gojobori have shown [7] that proteins produced in high
amounts (e.g. ribosomal proteins) tend to avoid amino-acids that are expensive
in terms of metabolic cost in aerobic conditions. This is an evidence that aminoacid composition of proteins is under the control of natural selection to enhance
metabolic eﬃciency. On an other hand, the inﬂuence of the G+C content on the
average amino-acid composition of proteins has been documented for a long time
(see [6] and references therein): in G+C rich genomes, the encoded proteins tend
to use amino-acid that are coded by G+C rich codons. Three groups of aminoacids can be deﬁned to reﬂect their expected dependence on the G+C content
[6]. A visual representation of Akashi and Gojobori data [7] taking into account
these three groups of amino-acids is given in Fig. 2 that was generated with the
following S code:
cost <- list(Ile = 32.3, Phe = 52.0, Lys = 30.3, Tyr = 50.0,
Asn = 14.7, Leu = 27.3, Met = 34.3, Asp = 12.7, Glu = 15.3,
Ser = 11.7, Val = 23.3, Thr = 18.7, His = 38.3, Gln = 16.3,
Cys = 24.7, Trp = 74.3, Arg = 27.3, Ala = 11.7, Pro = 20.3,
Gly = 11.7)gc.groups <- factor(rep(c(1, 2, 3), c(6, 10, 4)),
ordered = TRUE, label = c("low G+C", "mid G+C", "high G+C"))
stripchart(unlist(cost)˜gc.groups, pch = 19, ylim = c(0.5,3.5),
xlim = c(0, max(unlist(cost))) )bx <- boxplot(unlist(cost)
˜gc.groups, horizontal = TRUE, add = TRUE)

Fig. 2. Metabolic cost of the 20 amino-acids expressed in high-energy phosphate bond
equivalent, ∼P, per amino-acid. Data are from table 1 in [7]. The box-and-whisker plot
is a simple summary of data: the box represents the ﬁrst quartile, the median and the
last quartile ; the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is no more
than 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box.

Fig. 2 shows that there is a trend for amino-acids that are favoured in high
G+C genome to be less expensive in term of metabolic cost than those favoured
low G+C genomes. It is therefore tempting to connect this with the result from
Naya et. al. showing [5] that the G+C content is higher in aerobic bacteria.
This is however not suﬃcient to conclude because we have to take into account
the frequencies of amino-acid in proteins. For instance, the rigth outlier in the
middle G+C group corresponds to Trp (i.e. tryptophan) which is known to be
one of the rarest amino-acid in proteins (cf for instance table 1 in [8]).

Data Analyses

All analyses were done under R [2]. R is an Open Source implementation of the
S language and similar to the commercial implementation S-Plus. S is both a general programming language and an extensible interactive environment for data
analysis and graphics. See http://www.r-project.org for information on the
project and CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) http://cran.rproject.org for available software and packages.
The model that predicts the frequency of a given amino-acid, aa, as function
of the G+C content, θ, in absence of selective constraints is deﬁned by:
P (θ, aa) =

f (θ, aa)
8 − (1 − θ)2 (1 + θ)

This is a simple probabilistic model in which coding sequences are generated by
random sampling from a DNA urn with a given G+C content. The numerator
reﬂects the structure of the genetic code and the denominator is a correcting
factor due to stop codons (see [6] for details).

source code that was used to produce Fig. 3 is available at the URL:

Results and Discussion
Results

Results are summarized by Fig. 3 which is divided into two panels sharing as
common x-axis the genomic G+C content, ranging from 0.25 to 0.75, as expected
in bacteria.
The bottom panel of Fig.3 recalls Naya et. al. recent breakthrough [5]: the
G+C content is higher in aerobic bacteria (on the right) than in anaerobic bacteria (on the left). A direct representation of data, with a small amount of noise

added to break ties, is given on the top for aerobic species and at the bottom
for anaerobic species. Although the two distributions are overlapping, there is
clearly a trend for aerobic species to be G+C rich.
The top panel of Fig. 3 has a common y-scale expressed in aerobic metabolic
cost (in high-energy phosphate bond equivalent, ∼P, per amino-acid) for the
four following items:
1. The bar on the top right gives the range of observed selective eﬀects [7]
between proteins with a ∼ 105 -fold diﬀerence in terms of intracellular concentration. This bar is important to show a biologically relevant scale: a 2 ∼P
per amino-acid diﬀerence in aerobic cost is enough to be selected in highly
expressed genes. This bar gives also an idea of the within-species variability
for the average protein aerobic cost.
2. The doted line represents what would be the average protein aerobic cost
if protein composition was under the sole control of directional mutation
pressure [6]. This model shows that under neutral conditions, if there were no
selective constraints on the average amino-acid composition of protein, there
would be an interest of being G+C rich under aerobic conditions because the
cost decreases signiﬁcantly (as compared to the the reference bar) when the
G+C content increases. Note that the observed trend has a lower intensity,
as expected, because the average protein composition is not completely free
of selective constraints, so that the model is not realist.
3. The points represent the average (uniform protein weighting) aerobic cost
for 293 bacteria, whose protein composition was deduced from a previously
described dataset [9]. The actual average cost for a cell is expected to be
lower because the uniform protein weighting is not realist. We should weight
individual protein composition to take into account their intra-cellular concentrations in the cell, but this information is not available.
4. The line is the best least-squares ﬁt: there is a signiﬁcant decrease from low
G+C to high G+C bacteria: from 24.7 to 21.9 ∼P per amino-acid. This
2.8 ∼P per amino-acid variation compares well the within-bacteria variation
between highly and poorly expressed proteins [7] depicted by the reference
bar.
3.2

Discussion

As noted by an anonymous referee of this paper, and I would like to take this
opportunity to thanks him/her for valuable suggestions, I have assumed in the
following discussion thatdirectional mutational pressure (responsible for generation of G+Ccontent) is free from selection. However, we can not exclude the
possibility that themutational pressure is subjected in some way to selection (e.g.
repairsystems may be selected to prefer some mutational defects than other leading tocomposition bias). I think this is unlikely, but even if this was true we
would still have an example of exaptation at the molecular level. Features coopted as exaptations have two possible previous statuses. They may have been

686

adaptations for another function, or they may have been non-adaptative features
(cf section VI C in [1]).
It would be tempting to connect the top and the bottom of Fig. 3, assuming
that no confounding factor is present, by a simple regular selective scenario: aerobic low cost amino acid are encoded by G+C rich codons so that the selection
for low cost amino-acids at the proteome level has induced a G+C enrichment in
coding sequences. This is, however, not defendable because in G+C rich bacteria the whole genome, including non-coding regions and synonymous positions,
are also enriched in G+C content (cf [3] and references therein). The selective
advantage results from the long-term eﬀects of a directional mutation pressure.
This is an example of exaptation at the molecular level: having a high G+C content is interesting under aerobic conditions, but this was unforeseeable before
the oxygen concentration was enough on Earth.
