Abstract. We have studied the dynamics of expansion of diploid, sexually reproducing populations onto new territories demanding diﬀerent
genetic adaptations. Populations succeeded in the new habitats if the
mutations of alleles responsible for adaptation to the new conditions
were recessive. If behind the hostile territory another friendly habitat
exists, several diﬀerent scenarios are possible, including one in which the
middle, most hostile, habitat remains empty, separating populated two,
more friendly, ones.

Introduction

Sexual reproduction is one of the most interesting phenomena in Nature. Thus,
it is obvious that even physicists are interested in this strategy, though without
spectacular successes (negative birth rate is observed in the physics departments
all over the world). Some of them even succeeded in proving that the strategy
of sexual reproduction is a big misunderstanding of Nature and asexual populations would have much higher reproduction potential than sexual ones [1].
Such conclusions can be reached as the result of an evolution simulation if dominance of defective alleles is assumed. In fact, in Nature genomes posses a lot
of redundant information and one of the simplest ways to get redundancy at all
genetic loci is to be diploid. Organisms can proﬁt from redundancy if the mutated information (defective gene) is recessive which means that its defect can be
complemented by the proper gene - the allele of the defective one in the diploid
genome (wild copy of a gene). If the mutated gene dominates and expresses defective phenotype, then increasing the number of copies of such genes is rather
a loosing strategy. That is why the number of loci in diploid genomes where
mutations lead to dominant deleterious functions is low. In many instances, like
mutations in oncogenes, it may be even connected with a special Nature’s policy - elimination of old dispensable organisms (professors). Sexual strategy of
reproduction usually needs two well balanced sets of information because these
sets should be separated into two equivalent pools of genes in gametes which,

joining in pairs, produce new individuals. It seems reasonable that it would still
be better to increase the redundancy by forming triploids or tetraploids. But
even neglecting the costs of replication of the redundant information it could
be a loosing strategy if there were too many loci with potentially dominant
mutations in the genomes [2]. Nevertheless, dominance is a rather complicated
problem in biology. It is possible that a mutation in the same pair of alleles can
be recessive in one condition or for one phenotype while dominant in another
one. Let’s imagine a pair of alleles producing an enzyme which splits a toxic
compound. If one allele of the pair is mutated the toxic compound can still be
eliminated from the organism - the mutation is recessive. What would happen if
the mutation in the gene produced an enzyme which would transform the other
compound into a cancerogen - a product promoting cancerogenesis ? If the organism is exposed to this pre-cancerogenic compound such a mutation behaves as
dominant. Thus, the status of mutations could depend on some environmental
conditions. Immunology supports some other examples of complicated relations
between diﬀerent alleles of the same locus and environment [3]. The distribution of the main blood group antigens A,B,O in the human population is very
uneven on Earth. If an individual has antigen A, it cannot produce antibodies
anti-A because it would develop an auto-immune disease. If in the environment
there is a pathogen with A-like antigens, organisms cannot develop the immune
response against this antigen. Some pathogens are known which can use such a
mimicry to ﬁnd a defenseless host. Some pathogens can be so promiscuous that
they use mimicry to invade the host and ﬁnally they may induce cancerogenesis
[4]. In our simulations we tried to show that redeﬁnition of loci from recessive to
dominant is much more dangerous for the survival of the whole population than
redeﬁnition of the value of alleles in the locus from positive to negative, keeping
the dominance unchanged.

Model

We consider a population composed initially of N (0) individuals located at the
leftmost part of the square lattice, of dimensions 150×50 lattice sites, forming our
system. Each individual, apart from its location on the lattice is characterized
by its genotype g and age age. The genotype is a double string of length L =
32 of zeros and ones. From the genotype the individual’s phenotype,f , also of
length L, is constructed as a product of the values at corresponding loci. The
rules of taking the product depend whether a zero is declared at the dominant
allele, or not. The population is under the inﬂuence of the external ”ﬁeld“, which
could be the climate, represented as the optimal phenotype,F , of length L with
components equal either zero or one. The optimal phenotype changes along the
X-axis. The system is divided into three regions, labelled later I, II, III, with
the corresponding optima FI , FII , FIII . At the leftmost region (I) the optimum
is just a string of zeros. In the second region a certain number, Lch, of 0’s is
switched to 1’s. In the third region either there are twice as many changes as in
the region II, or the ”climate“ is the same is in the region I.

At the beginning the population has random values of their genotypes and
locations on the lattice. The algorithm goes as follows
1. an individual j is picked at random,
2. its adaptation to the external conditions, i.e. the agreement between its
phenotype and the optimal one is calculated from the formula
adj =

where the F is taken according to the position of the individual in the system
(in the I, II or III region),
3. its survival probability is determined
pj = exp (−s agej /adj ) ,

(2)

where s is the selection pressure. A random number r ∈ (0, 1) is drawn. If
r > pj the individual is removed from the system. Otherwise
4. a search is made in the nearest neighborhood for an empty place to move
the individual. If successful and the age of the individuals is greater then
one (to eliminate coupling of oﬀspring right after birth)
5. another search is made in the nearest neighborhood of the new position for
a partner. Once found
6. the pair produce at most 4 oﬀspring, each of which receives its genotype independently via recombination and crossing over of the parents’ genotypes.
Each loci of the oﬀspring could be mutated with a probability pm, which is
a parameter of the model. Independent search is made in the Moore neighborhood (8 sites nearest to the ﬁrst parent) to put an oﬀspring. If a search
was not successful, the progeny is not born. This is the only place where a
kind of Verhulst factor regulates the density of the population.
When, at a time t, as many individuals were picked as ﬁrst partners, as was the
total number of individuals at that time, i.e. N (t), one Monte Carlo step has
been made and the age of all individuals is incremented by one. In the following,
time is measured always in Monte Carlo steps (MCS). This kind of models has
been used before by us in diﬀerent contexts [5].

Results and Discussion

Populations simulated under the chosen selection pressure and mutational pressure parameters are stable and survive the prolonged simulations. In these populations, mutations in all alleles of all loci were recessive. If we re-declare the
values of some loci which means that the new environment requires diﬀerent
alleles in these loci, the populations eventually adapt to the new conditions and
approximate to the concentration usual for such conditions (Fig. 1).
The situation is much more dangerous for the simulated populations if the
redeﬁnition of the loci values is connected with the declared dominance of the

mutated genes. The chance for survival of the population depends strongly on
the number of declared dominant loci (Fig. 2).
In our simulations we have assumed that the territory where the population
evolves is divided into three sectors. Initially the population occupies one sector
(left) and it is adapted to the environmental conditions in it, with all mutations
recessive.
Conditions in the middle sector require diﬀerent values of some genes and
in one case mutations in these loci are recessive, while in the second case these
mutations are dominant. In the ﬁrst case the population invades the second
sector, adapts to the new conditions and eventually reaches the third sector which
still demands the new adaptations. In the second case the population cannot
permanently occupy the middle sector. Some trials are observed of settling the

territory close to the border, but concentration of the population drops very
quickly with the distance to the friendly maternal territory (Fig. 3).
To test the possibility of crossing the hostile territory we have declared that
the third sector (the right one) is as friendly as the ﬁrst one and it requires
the same phenotypes as the ﬁrst one, but the initial population was settled on
the ﬁrst sector only (Fig. 4). It is obvious that like in the above simulations,
if there were no dominant deleterious mutations, populations expanded onto
all three sectors with approximately the same concentrations in all of them.
But if the mutations in the re-declared loci were dominant, the populations
were not able to cross the hostile territory. Only in some rare instances they
succeeded in penetrating this sector. Having reached the new territory with the
same environmental conditions as the initial one, the population occupied it
very fast. The interesting observation is that the middle hostile territory is not
desolate any more, though the population is less concentrated in it.
It should be noted that the problem of dominance has been recently raised
by the modern eugenics techniques. In the so called ”risk cases“ the fertilization
in vitro and embryo transfer followed by preimplantation genetic diagnosis is
recommended. It is obvious that heterozygotic embryos are eliminated even in
case of recessive mutations. Such a procedure mimics the dominance of mutations. For more discussion of eugenics problem see also [6]. Further studies should
answer the question whether the hostile territory in the reach of populations
ameliorates the genetic status of the whole population.

Conclusion

It has been shown that it is important to consider the dominance of alleles when
studying the sexual strategy of reproduction. Populations can expand to new
