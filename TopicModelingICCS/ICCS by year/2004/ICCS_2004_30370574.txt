Abstract. In this paper, we study the reconstructing of signals based
on regular and irregular incremental integral samples in some nonbandlimited space—-spline subspace, and we obtain reconstructing formulas with a new method.

Introduction

In digital signal and image processing, digital communication, etc., a continuous
signal is usually represented and processed by using its discrete samples. For a
bandlimited signal of ﬁnite energy, it is completely characterized by its samples,
by the famous classical Shannon sampling theorem. However, in many real applications sampling points are not always regularly and sampled value may not
be values of a signal f precisely at times xk for the inertia of the measurement
aparatus. As for the signal spaces, they are not always bandlimited signal of
ﬁnite energy. The problem arose initially in the design of an interferometer in
which the interferogram is obtained using a continuously moving mirror, but
may also have bearing in other problem in which the data are smoothed by an
integrating sensor, such as CCD array with slow response time compared to the
sample integral. So we need to give the reconstruction of signal from samples of
its integral. In this paper, we discuss the reconstruction of signal from samples
of its integral in spline subspaces.
Though Sun and Zhou studied this problem in [7], their result and method
are not easy to apply in practical application and computation. We will give
reconstruction formula from samples of its integral in spline subspaces with the
simple method. And the reconstruction formula is more practical in application.

Reconstruction of Signal from Irregular Incremental
Integral Samples on Spline Subspace

Next, we will study the reconstruction from irregular incremental integral
samples. We will show the following Theorem 3.1 before we giving the main
result.
Theorem 3.1 Let sampling set X = {xn } be a real sequence and satisfy
supi (xi+1 − xi ) = δ < 1. Then {k(·, xj )} is frame for VN +1 and there exist dual
frames {k˜xj : xj ∈ X} ⊂ VN +1 such that for any f ∈ VN +1 , we have
f, kxj k˜xj (x) =

f (x) =

f (xj )k˜xj (x),
j∈Z

j∈Z

where k(·, ·) as the same in Lemma 2.3.
Proof. From the discussion of [1, 3], we know Theorem 3.1 holds.
We make little changes for the proof of Theorem 2.2 to obtain the proof of
the following Theorem 3.2. So we will omit its proof.
Theorem 3.2 Let

Conclusion

In this paper, we obtain reconstruction formula from samples of its integral in
spline subspaces with the simple new method. And the reconstruction formula
is more practical in application. Furthermore, we obtain reconstruction formula
of signal from irregular incremental integral samples in spline subspace too. We
conjecture the new method remains validity for a much large class of shiftinvariant spaces. We will study it in future work.
