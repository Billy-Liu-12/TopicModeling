Abstract. Fredholm integral equations arise naturally in the context
of ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations: Two-point boundary value
problems can be reformulated as Fredholm integral equations, whose kernels are continuous but have ﬁnite jump discontinuities in their derivatives. Two-dimensional elliptic boundary problems can be reformulated as
Fredholm integral equations with kernels that have singularities, some
having logarithmic singularities. In this note, we describe quadrature
methods whose accuracies can be improved at will. These are obtained
by improving the underlying numerical quadrature formulas in a clever
fashion. In the case of two-point boundary value problems, they are obtained by correcting the trapezoidal rule appropriately to the accuracy
required. In the case of boundary integral equations, they are obtained
by ﬁrst correcting the basic trapezoidal rule and then extrapolating it to
required accuracy.

Introduction

In this note, we describe two quadrature methods for the numerical solution
of Fredholm integral equations that have been proposed recently. Despite the
singular nature of the integral equations involved, these methods turn out to
be very eﬃcient in the sense that their accuracies can be improved at will, the
increase in their computational costs being minor.
The relevant integral equations are those that arise in the context of ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations with boundary conditions. We give two
examples of such problems now.
1. Let the two-point boundary value problem
y = f (x, y),

0 < x < 1;

a0 y(0) + b0 y (0) = c0 ,

a1 y(1) + b1 y (1) = c1 ,

be given. Here f (x, y) is a linear or nonlinear function in y. Subtracting
k 2 y, with k > 0 chosen appropriately (even “optimally”), from both sides of
the diﬀerential equations, and using Green’s functions, this problem can be
reformulated in the form
1

g(x, t) k 2 y(t) − f (t, y(t)) dt,

y(x) = r(x) +
0

with appropriate r(x) and g(x, t). Here the Green’s functions are continuous
for x = t but their partial derivatives have ﬁnite jump discontinuities across
x = t; they are smooth everywhere else on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. An important advantage of approximating y(x) via the integral equation formulation is that,
in case of singularly perturbed problems, boundary layers, if present, can be
resolved with great precision. Recall that this is a diﬃcult task when the
diﬀerential equation is attacked with diﬀerence methods.
For example, with y (0) = 0 and y(1) = 1 as boundary conditions, r(x) and
g(x, t) are given by
r(x) =

cosh kx
,
sinh kx

g(x, t) =

1
k cosh k

cosh kx sinh k(1 − t), 0 ≤ x ≤ t
.
sinh k(1 − x) cosh kt, t ≤ x ≤ 1

This approach was initiated by Keller [1], who used it to prove constructive
existence and uniqueness theorems for solutions of the nonlinear problems
above and also for designing a quadrature method based on the trapezoidal
rule for computing numerical solutions. It was reﬁned and developed further
by Pennline [2], [3], [4].
2. Let u(x, y) be the solution of the two-dimensional Laplace’s equation with
Dirichlet boundary condition
P ∈ Ω;

∆u(P ) = 0,

u(P ) = f (P ) P ∈ ∂Ω,

where ∆ is the two-dimensional Laplacian, ∆ = ∂ 2 /∂x2 + ∂ 2 /∂y 2 , Ω is a
ﬁnite simply connected open domain in the x-y plane, and ∂Ω is its boundary.
u(x, y) can be obtained from the integral
ρ(Q) log |P − Q| dlQ ,

u(P ) =

P ∈ Ω,

∂Ω

where dlQ is the line element on ∂Ω, and ρ(Q) is the solution of the Fredholm
integral equation of the ﬁrst kind
ρ(Q) log |P − Q| dlQ = f (P ),

P ∈ ∂Ω.

∂Ω

This is the so-called boundary integral equation formulation of the interior
Dirichlet problem. A nice feature of this formulation is that its dimension is
one less than that of the original diﬀerential equation formulation.
Now, the kernel g(P, Q) = log |P − Q| of the new formulation is smooth for
all Q ∈ ∂Ω, except when Q = P , where it has a logarithmic singularity. This
is easily seen after parameterizing the closed curve ∂Ω appropriately. Also,
in terms of the parameter used to represent ∂Ω, g(P, Q) is periodic in P and
Q, and the solution ρ(P ) and the right-hand side f (P ) are periodic in P .
In addition, if ∂Ω is smooth, then ρ(P ), P ∈ ∂Ω, is also a smooth function.
These facts can be used to advantage when treating the integral equation
numerically.

Treatment of Kernels with Jump Discontinuities

We begin with integral equations of the form
1

y(x) =

g(x, t)F (t, y(t)) dt,

0 ≤ x ≤ 1,

(1)

0

where (i) r(x) is continuous on [0, 1], (ii) g(x, t) is continuous over the set [0, 1] ×
∂k
[0, 1], its partial derivatives gk (x, t) ≡ ∂t
k g(x, t), k = 1, 2, . . . , are smooth for
0 ≤ t ≤ x and for x ≤ t ≤ 1, with ﬁnite jump discontinuities across t = x,
namely, gk (x, x+) − gk (x, x−) = δk (x) ∈ C[0, 1], k = 1, 2, . . . , and (iii) F (x, y)
is linear or nonlinear in y and smooth on some set ∆ = [0, 1] × [R1 , R2 ], where
[R1 , R2 ] is a ﬁnite, semi-inﬁnite, or inﬁnite interval.
The numerical treatment of this integral equation has been considered recently by Sidi and Pennline [8], and we follow this treatment here.
If a solution to (1) exists, then it can be shown that it is smooth over [0, 1].
We assume that a unique solution y(x) exists and that R1 ≤ y(x) ≤ R2 when
0 ≤ x ≤ 1. A suﬃcient condition for this to be true is
1

|g(x, t)| dt

x∈[0,1]

Choose a positive integer N and set h = 1/N and xi = ih, i = 0, 1, . . . , N.
Next, for x = xi , i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N }, we approximate the integral

I(x) =

φ(t) = g(x, t)F (t, y(t)),

Now, by the fact that F (t, y) is smooth in [0, 1]×[R1 , R2 ] and by the assumed
properties of g(x, t), φ(t) is smooth for t ∈ [0, x] and t ∈ [x, 1], continuous for
t ∈ [0, 1] with ﬁnite jump discontinuities across t = x in all its derivatives.
Consequently, for x = xi ∈ (0, 1), i.e., for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N − 1}, T (h) has the
following Euler–Maclaurin expansion:
p−1

I(x) = T (h) −

B2s (2s−1)
φ

(2s)!

(2)

where E(h) = O(h2p ) as h → 0, and uniformly in i. For x = x0 = 0 and x = xN =
1, the summation involving the terms containing φ(2s−1) (x+) − φ(2s−1) (x−) is
absent from (2).

Obviously, I(x) − T (h) = O(h2 ) as h → 0, and thus the accuracy of T (h) is
simply too low. The formula

on the other hand, satisﬁes I(x) − Tp (h) = O(h2p ) as h → 0. Since Tp (h) involves derivatives of the unknown function y(x), we cannot make direct use
of it, unfortunately. However, we can approximate Tp (h) via another formula
Tˆp (h), involving only the values of y(x) and no derivatives of it, for which
I(x) − Tˆp (h) = O(h2p ) as h → 0 as well.
We show how this is done only for p = 2, and refer the the reader to [8] for
all other values of p. We have, for x = xi , i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N − 1},
T2 (h) = T (h) −

φ (1) − φ (0) − φ (x+) − φ (x−) h2 .

We ﬁrst break up φ (t) in the form
φ (t) = g1 (x, t)F (t, y(t)) + g(x, t)

d
F (t, y(t)).
dt

Then we approximate φ (0) and φ (1) by using one-sided numerical diﬀerentiad
tion formulas for dt
F (t, y(t)) at t = 0 and t = 1. These are
Q (0) =

3Q(1) − 4Q(1 − h) + Q(1 − 2h) + Q (ξ)h2 ,

Next, by continuity of g(x, t) across t = x, we have
Q (1) =

0 < ξ < 2h,
1 − 2h < ξ < 1.

φ (x+) − φ (x−) = g1 (x, x+) − [g1 (x, x−) F (x, y(x)) = δ1 (x)F (x, y(x)).
Tˆ2 (h) is obtained by combining these in T2 (h), and we obviously have I(x) −
Tˆ2 (h) = O(h4 ) as h → 0. We ﬁnally use Tˆ2 (h) to deﬁne our quadrature method
for the integral equation (1).
The resulting quadrature method is deﬁned via the following N +1 equations:

Here Fi ≡ F (xi , yi ) and yi is the approximation to y(xi ).
Using precisely the same procedure, we can derive a quadrature method for
(1) that is based on the quadrature formula Tˆp (h). Again, this method involves
the numerical solution of N + 1 equations in the unknowns yj . As shown in [8],
under appropriate conditions, this system has a unique solution for the yj when
N is suﬃciently large, and that y(xj ) − yj = O(h2p ) as h → 0 (equivalently,
N → ∞), this error being uniform in j.
The quadrature method based on Tˆ2 (h) is illustrated with two examples
involving nonlinear two-point boundary value problems in [8].

Treatment of Kernels with Logarithmic Singularity

We now turn to the numerical solution of Fredholm integral equations of the
form
b

K(t, x)f (x) dx = g(t),

ωf (t) +

a ≤ t ≤ b;

ω = 0, 1.

(4)

a

(Such equations are of the ﬁrst or the second kind depending on whether ω = 0
or ω = 1, respectively.) The equations that are of interest to us here have the
following important features: (i) The kernel K(t, x) is periodic both in t and in x
with period T = b − a and is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable in (−∞, ∞) \ {t + kT }∞
k=−∞ .
It has a polar singularity and/or a branch singularity (of algebraic or logarithmic
or algebraic-logarithmic type) at x = t when t ∈ [a, b]. (ii) The input function
g(t) and the solution f (t) are both periodic with period T = b − a and inﬁnitely
smooth on (−∞, ∞).
In case K(t, x) has an integrable singularity across x = t, (4) is said to be
weakly singular. In case K(t, x) ∼ c/(x − t) as x → t for some constant c = 0,
b
and the integral a K(t, x)f (x) dx is deﬁned only in the Cauchy principal value
sense, it is said to be singular.

The numerical treatment of these integral equations has been considered recently by Sidi and Israeli [7]. A comparison of the quadrature formulas proposed
there with others has been given in [5]. For an extensive summary of the subject, see Sidi [6, Section 25.3 and Appendix D]. Here we restrict our attention
to weakly singular integral equations with only logarithmic singularities across
x = t. For other types of singularities, the reader is referred to [7] and [6].
A logarithmically singular kernel can be expressed in the form
K(t, x) = H1 (t, x) log |t − x| + H2 (t, x),

(5)

where H1 (t, x) and H2 (t, x) are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable for all t, x ∈ [a, b] (including t = x), but are not necessarily periodic. We assume that H1 (t, t) ≡ 0.
Note that, in our method below, we do not require H1 (t, x) and H2 (t, x) for all
x, but only for x = t; H1 (t, t) and H2 (t, t) can be obtained simply by expanding
K(t, x) about x = t.
Let n be a positive integer and set h = T /n and xi = a + ih, i = 1, . . . , n.
In addition, let t ∈ {x1 , . . . , xn }. Let us now deﬁne the “corrected” trapezoidal

Here ζ(s) is the Riemann Zeta function. From these expansions, it follows that
I[h; t] − I[t] = O(h3 ) as h → 0.
The quadrature method based on the rule I[h; t] is now deﬁned by the equations
ω f˜k + I[h; xk ] = g(xk ), k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(10)

More explicitly, these equations are

where f˜i is the approximation to f (xi ). In general, the accuracy of the f˜i is the
same as that of the underlying numerical quadrature formula, which is I[h; t] in
this case. We can increase the accuracy of the quadrature method by increasing
that of I[h; t], which we propose to achieve by using extrapolation. What makes
this possible is the periodicity of the integrand K(t, x)f (x) as a function of x.
We turn to this subject next.
We start by using only one extrapolation to eliminate the term β1 (t)h3 from
the asymptotic expansion of I[h; t]. Let us choose h = T /n for some even integer
n and let xi = a + ih, i = 0, 1, . . . , n. Performing this single extrapolation, we
obtain the Romberg-type quadrature rule
J1 [h; t] =

βk (t)h2k+1 as h → 0,
7

(13)

hence J1 [h; t] − I[t] = O(h5 ) as h → 0. The quadrature method for (4) based on
J1 [h; t] is thus
ω f˜k + J1 [h; xk ] = g(xk ), k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(16)

By applying two extrapolations, we can remove the terms βk (t)h2k+1 , k =
1, 2, from the asymptotic expansion of I[h; t]. This time we choose h = T /n for
an integer n that is divisible by 4, and let xi = a+ih, i = 0, 1, . . . , n. Performing
the two extrapolations, we obtain the Romberg-type quadrature rule

hence J2 [h; t] − I[t] = O(h7 ) as h → 0. The quadrature method for (4) based on
