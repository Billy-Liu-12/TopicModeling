Abstract. In the present paper the discretization of a particular model
arising in the economic ﬁeld of innovation diﬀusion is developed. It consists of an optimal control problem governed by an ordinary diﬀerential
equation. We propose a direct optimization approach characterized by an
explicit, ﬁxed step-size continuous Runge-Kutta integration for the state
variable approximation. Moreover, high-order Gaussian quadrature rules are used to discretize the objective function. In this way, the optimal
control problem is converted into a nonlinear programming one which is
solved by means of classical algorithms.

Introduction

Dynamic optimization represents a challenging problem in several ﬁelds of applied science. From biology to engineering or economics, a wide variety of phenomena can be described in terms of optimal control problems, where a cost
functional has to be optimized with respect to variables which control the system dynamics.
Numerical methods for dynamical optimization fall essentially into two classes: classical, indirect methods, relying on the maximum Pontryagin principle,
with the main drawback of a lack of robustness, and so-called direct methods
which attempt to ﬁnd a solution through a direct optimization of the cost functional. In this paper we focus on the last type of methods and introduce a
numerical scheme based on the continuous Runge-Kutta integration ([9], [11])
to solve a speciﬁc model in economics. The rationale for this choice is that an
eﬃcient and accurate approximation of the system dynamics can be obtained
with a reduced number of variable evaluations. A further improvement in accuracy is achieved by adopting high-order Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules ([1])
for the functional discretization.
The approach has been tested on a speciﬁc innovation diﬀusion model recently proposed in [5]. The early mathematical models in this ﬁeld date back to
1950 (see [7]) and represent an interesting research subject in economics, sociology, marketing as well as in applied mathematics. The problem is easily stated
as the one of maximizing the proﬁt of a monopolistic ﬁrm, due to the sale of a

new product, by planning an advertising and price strategy. The speciﬁc model
we are concerned with, is brieﬂy described in the next section. In Section 3 we
introduce the numerical approximation which combines the continuous RungeKutta integration with high-order Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules in order to
discretize the constrained problem at hand. Numerical results for some values
of the model parameters, shown in Section 4, validate the eﬀectiveness of the
proposed approach. Finally we draw our conclusions in Section 5.

The Continuous Model

We assume that a monopolistic ﬁrm, manufacturing a new durable good (i.e. an
innovation), has to plan advertising and price strategies in order to maximize
the proﬁt due to the product sale over a ﬁnite time horizon [0, T ].
We suppose that the rate of adopters increase is aﬀected by the selling price
p(t) according to a given price response function q(p), which is usually positive
and decreasing. Diﬀerent price response functions have been proposed in the
literature (see [6]); most of them belong to a speciﬁc class obeying the following
law
1
1−λ
if λ = 1
q(p) = [c − (1 − λ)αp]+
(1)
c exp(−αp)
if λ = 1
with c, λ, α ∈ R, α > 0. Moreover, a further demand eﬀect is represented by the
amount of advertising by media γ(t), ranging from 0 to a maximum value γmax .
Following the same approach of [5], we consider the spatial-temporal innovation diﬀusion accounting for an interaction among the individuals and assuming
that the demand eﬀect is related to the so-called word-of-mouth phenomenon.
More precisely, the adopters are assumed to have a local inﬂuence according to a
given kernel K(z, z ), with z, z ∈ Ω, where Ω ⊂ R2 represents the geographical
domain the population lives in. Under the further assumption that K(z, z ) is
independent of variable z , we denote
K=

Ω

K(z, z ) dz.

As a consequence, the individuals adopting the new product are uniformly distributed with respect to space variables. Then, if A(t) represents the adopters
cumulative number at time t, the related evolution dynamics can be modelled
as follows
dA
(t) = q(p(t)) (KA(t) + γ(t)) (1 − A(t)),
dt

t ∈ [0, T ]

(2)

provided with condition A(0) = 0, that is no individual has adopted the innovation at initial time (for more details, see [3] and [5]).
Furthermore, we deﬁne the ﬁrm’s payoﬀ function as
T

J(p, γ) =
0

exp(−rt) (p(t) − cp )

dA
(t) − ca γ(t) dt
dt

(3)

where ca , cp and r denote the per unit advertising cost, the unitary production
cost and the discount factor, respectively, all assumed to be constant during the
whole time horizon.
The resulting optimal control model consists of maximizing (3) with respect
to control parameters represented by price and advertising, governed by state
equation (2). More precisely, deﬁning F as the space of all the functions mapping
[0, T ] into R and setting
U = {(u, v) ∈ F 2 | u, v are piecewise continuous, 0 ≤ u(t), 0 ≤ v(t) ≤ γmax },
the problem reduces to
max J(p, γ)

p,γ∈U

(4)

constrained by equation (2) with condition A(0) = 0. For a theoretical analysis
of the model see [5]. Moreover, in [4] a preliminary numerical solution of the
problem is given accounting for spatial eﬀects of the new product diﬀusion in
the market; in that case the optimal control model is governed by a partial
diﬀerential equation.

Numerical Approximation

Our main interest consists of performing the numerical discretization of the
previous continuous model based on the use of continuous extensions of RungeKutta methods combined with Gaussian quadrature rules.
Let us introduce a mesh 0 = t0 < t1 < . . . < tN = T of the given time
interval [0, T ] with constant step length h, then ti = ih for each i = 0, . . . N .
Moreover, setting
ψ(A(t), p(t), γ(t), t) = q(p(t)) (KA(t) + γ(t)) (1 − A(t)),
we deﬁne
g(p(t), γ(t), A(t), t) = exp(−rt)((p(t) − cp )ψ(A(t), p(t), γ(t), t) − ca γ(t)).
Hence, the integral in (3) can be written as

We approximate every integral by means of the well-known Gauss-Legendre
rules; thus, the right-hand term in (5) is discretized as

and sl , wl represent the knots (i.e. the zeros of Legendre polynomial of order
L + 1) and the coeﬃcients, respectively, of the chosen quadrature scheme (see
[1]). Notice that the quantities involved in the previous approximation are the
values of both the controls p, γ and the state variables A as sampled at each
instant τi,l .
If we assume to approximate control parameters in the class of piecewise linear
functions
V = {v ∈ F | v|[ti ,ti+1 ] is linear},
τi,l = ti + h

we have that
p(τi,l ) = ρl p(ti ) + ξl p(ti+1 ),
γ(τi,l ) = ρl γ(ti ) + ξl γ(ti+1 )
1 − sl
and ξl = 1 − ρl for every l = 0, . . . , L.
2
Moreover, in order to evaluate A(τi,l )’s, the state equation is discretized by
applying continuous extensions of Runge-Kutta methods. We consider an explicit
m-stage scheme speciﬁed by the Butcher array
with ρl =

c A
bT
and its continuous extension characterized by coeﬃcients bj (θ) (j = 1, . . . , m)
which are suitable polynomials in θ ∈ [0, 1] obtained as in [11]. The resulting
scheme for the state system is the following
m

A(τi,l ) = A(ti ) + h

bj (ξl )ψ(Aj , p(ti + hcj ), γ(ti + hcj ), ti + hcj ),

aj,v ψ(Av , p(ti + hcv ), γ(ti + hcv ), ti + hcv ), j = 1, . . . , m
v=1

(7)
starting from A(t0 ) = 0.
Note that condition 0 ≤ ξl ≤ 1 holds for each l = 0, . . . L. Furthermore, in
every interval (ti , ti+1 ) we should add extra control variables at each inner time
step σi,j := ti + hcj since, in general, σi,j = τi,l . However, additional controls
might be avoided simply by choosing Runge-Kutta scheme in such a way that
c1 = 0, cm = 1 and every inner cj is equal to ξl for some l = 0, . . . , L.
Finally, let us consider the following vector
u = (p(t0 ), p(t1 ), . . . , p(tN ), γ(t0 ), γ(t1 ), . . . , γ(tN ))T ∈ R2(N +1) .

where each uj denotes the j-th entry of vector u and the values A(τi,l ), depending on u itself, are computed by recursive formula (7). In this way, the
numerical approximation of the optimal control model described in Section 2
yields a solution to the nonlinear programming problem

i = 1, . . . , N + 1.

We note the proposed numerical discretization follows an idea similar to the one
provided by authors in [2].

Numerical Tests

In order to test the eﬀectiveness of the numerical procedure described in the
previous section, we use the Gauss-Legendre rule with 2 knots (i.e. L = 1);
furthermore, the chosen Runge-Kutta scheme is the continuous extension of the
2-stage improved Euler method (see [8]) where

b1 (θ) = − θ2 + θ

and b2 (θ) =

1 2
θ .

Discrete solutions have been achieved solving nonlinear programming Problem 1 in Matlab environment by means of fmincon routine.
In our numerical examples, the price response function is deﬁned in correspondence with λ = c = 1 in (1). We set the discount factor r = 0, since in this
case the theoretical solution of the continuous model is known; in particular, in
[5] it has been proven that optimal price is characterized by a concave behaviour,
while advertising strategy is a bang-bang function.
In Figures 1 and 2, we plot the approximate time evolution of price and
advertising strategies as well as adopters cumulative number obtained for different values of parameters speciﬁed in each caption. As it is shown in ﬁgures,
numerical results are in agreement with theoretical ones. We remark that the
case in Figure 2 shows an evident bang-bang behaviour which cannot be catched
by classical gradient algorithms. A further improvement could be obtained by
exploiting the advantages of global stochastic optimization approaches.

with the choice of price and advertising strategies maximizing the proﬁt coming
from its sale. The discrete procedure reduces a given optimal control problem
governed by ordinary diﬀerential equations to a nonlinear programming one.
More precisely, the discrete scheme is characterized by a direct optimization procedure obtained by using Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules in order to approximate the integral optimizing functional and continuous Runge-Kutta methods
for the state variables diﬀerential constraints. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows the reduction of nodal variable values necessary for the
chosen discretization while retaining a great accuracy in the solution. Finally,
the numerical results conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
