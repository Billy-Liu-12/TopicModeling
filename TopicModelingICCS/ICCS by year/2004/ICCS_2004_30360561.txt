Abstract. Modern Third Generation Wireless Networks demand more
and more resources in order to satisfy customers’ needs. And these resources can only be provided by a good Power Control. However, power
control needs an algorithm to work at the margin of the Quality of Service (QoS ) requirements. This work proposes a power control algorithm
modeled under probabilistic criteria. By means of applying a Markovian
model to a MAC Protocol (power control algorithm), to optimize the
power assignment to each user in the system. This protocol is highly
interrelated to the power control functionality to extract the maximum
capacity and ﬂexibility out of the WCDMA scheme.

Introduction

Recently, extensive investigations have been carried out into the application of
a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) as an air interface multiple access
scheme for IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications System) - 2000
/ UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System). CDMA is the technology for the third generation wireless personal communication systems.[1]
Power control is the single most important system requirement for CDMA
based wireless networks systems. In the absence of power control the eﬀect of
near/far phenomena is dominant, and the capacity of the CDMA mobile system
is very low. Power control allows users to share system resources equally between
themselves. Besides furthermore, with a proper power control it is possible to
lower transmitting power of the mobiles and prolong the battery life.
With this in mind, we will improve a MAC power control algorithm previously proposed in [2] and enhance its capabilities for an speciﬁc application: two
services (voice and multimedia) with diﬀerent rates in a 3G wireless network.

Model Description

Based on a Markovian process, the On-Oﬀ model or Eng-Set distribution oﬀers
an accurate information about transmission activity or inactivity of users. Using
this and adding it to a practical MAC protocol algorithm for power control, we
can determine with accuracy the activity of users transmitting, and to establish
the power vector PR . The power vector PR describes the total power transmitted.
2.1

Proposed Model

Taking the multimedia MAC protocol proposed in [2], and thinking about to
enhance their capabilities, we extend the protocol to consider more than one
service. The next step is to establish a power control vector determined by an
On-Oﬀ model with the purpose of knowing accurately how many users are in
activity, and give them suﬃcient power without causing interference to the rest
and keeping the QoS requirements.
Determination of the Number of Users. The number of packet transmission
that could be supported in the next frame is calculated on a frame by frame basis
to ensure the diﬀerent Bit Error Rate (BER) requirements of all type of users.
The general case for the power vector PR is deﬁned as

where the services are subject to the QoS constraints established in [2] and Pn,m
represents the states of a bidimensional Markov chain of Nk elements (k = 1, 2),
P1,j and P2,k are the power assigned to users j and k of services 1 and 2,
respectively, n1 and n2 determine how many users of the N1 and N2 are active
transmitting. Therefore the optimal power vector can be obtained by solving
the linear QoS equations in the powers. Since we are considering a single cell
scenario, we will drop the subindices with respect to cells and redeﬁne them
to consider the single cell scenario with two-classes of traﬃc. In this way the
Energy-bit to Noise ratio (Eb /N0 ) is established as

where γi,j is the (Eb/N0 )T arget of service i for user j, Pi,j the power transmitted
by user j of service i, Gi,j , the channel gain of user j of service i, Ri,j the
bit rate of user j and service i and ˆı, ˆ, represents the rest of users who are
transmitting and in consequence, interfering with i, j. In the case of Gˆı,ˆ and
Pˆı,ˆ , these are channel gain and power of the users interfering in the system to
the uplink transmission of user j of service i.

Algorithm Description

Hence, in order to show how the algorithm works, or how we get results from the
equations, the next procedure can help us to have a better understanding of the
functioning of this algorithm. Figure 1.a shows a block diagram of the procedure
to follow during the execution of the algorithm for evaluation purposes.
First, we have to deﬁne the activity parameters of the Markov chain (α, β,
δ and λ, see Figure 1.b), number of users, N1 and N2 , in the system, also the
power received in the uplink in the Base Station (BS) -this is in order to obtain
channel gains and the necessary power from it-, bandwidth W , rates R1 and R2
for each service, and the noise density η0 .
Once deﬁning these variables, we obtain by generating random numbers, the
position of each of the N1 +N2 users. This provides a random distance from the
BS, and then we obtain Pi,j and Gi,j , for each user in the system, independently
of the service they require. This is done since users are located within the cell.
So, with this parameter we evaluate Equation (2) in order to obtain γT arget
for both services.

Numerical Results

Two services in the system are established, voice and multimedia data with a
rate of 12.2 kbps and 128 kbps respectively. The activity parameters α and β
(that rule the Markov chain states, see Figure 1.b) were set in 1 second, δ and
λ were ﬁxed with 0.5 and 0.65 seconds respectively. The diameter of the cell
was established as 100 m. Evaluation parameters accomplish with the WCDMA
standard [3,4]. In ﬁgures 1.c and 1.d are shown the system behavior according to
the arriving of users in transmission process in comparison with perfect power
control. Notice that independently of the fading due the demand of the users,
all of them manifest the same data rate asked or assigned since the beginning.
In addition, because the Eb /N0 does not manifest abrupt changes, the Carrier
to Interference ratio (C/I ) obtained from it let us to get a constant throughput
through the arriving of transmitting users, see Figure 1.e. This last ﬁgure is also
compared with perfect power control.

Conclusions and Future Work

The power vector PR proposed in [2] was optimized using the Eng-Set distribution modeled by a bi-dimensional Markov chain for the two services proposed.
But in addition, the PR can be enhanced for more data rate services, each dimension of the Markov chain system means another service.
Since C/I does not aﬀect the throughput behavior, the QoS required was satisﬁed and shows how the algorithm works properly independently of the arriving
of users into the system. It is relevant to mention that the proposed algorithm
manifests an equal or better behavior than a perfect power control.
However, in order to expand this work to general applications, it will be
necessary add-on the multi cell capability in the algorithm, and in consequence
take into account the inter-cell interference. Other point could be the use of
multi rate with the purpose of maintain a higher Eb /N0 .
