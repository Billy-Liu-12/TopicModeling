Abstract. In this paper we develop a dynamic stochastic programming
model for bond portfolio management. A new risk measurement-shortfall
cost is put forward. It allows more tangible expression of the risks that
the decision makers face than does the traditional risk measure-variance
of terminal wealth. We also adopt the interest rate model of Black et
al. to generate scenarios of riskless short rates at future periods. An
example of bond portfolio management is presented to illustrate that
our model dominates the usual ﬁxed-mix model.

Introduction

The bond portfolio management can be viewed as a multi-period dynamic decision problem. Stochastic programming with recourse is used in the formulation
of the problem.
There are numbers of literature signiﬁcantly contributed in this ﬁeld. A fundamental contribution was made by Bradley and Crane(1972)[1], who proposed
a multi-period model for bond portfolio management. This kind of models involve enormous computation work that exceeds the computation ability of that
time. Over these years, progress in computational methods is impressive and
large scale problems can be eﬃciently solved with high reliability. Moreover, powerful computers can also easily be accessed to conduct optimization searches.
The obstacles for applying stochastic programming models are quickly receding. A successful application of this kind of models was reported by Carino et
al.(1994)[2] for asset/liability management problems in insurance ﬁrms. Golub
et al.(1995)[3] and Zenios et al.(1998)[4] applied them to the portfolio management of ﬁxed-income securities. Extensive validation experiments are carried
out to establish the eﬀectiveness of the model in dealing with uncertainty. Empirical tests shown that this kind of models outperform classical models based

on portfolio immunization and single period models. The latest progress in applying stochastic programming models was made by Kouwenberg(2001)[5]. The
author proposed a multi-period model for a Dutch pension fund. The development of portfolio management models is fully discussed in the book of Ziemba
and Mulvey(1998)[6], and that of Wang and Xia(2002)[7].
In the formulation of the model, one of the most important issues is how
to character the risk attitude of the investors. One natural alternative is the
variance of terminal wealth, as has been adopted by lots of literatures. However,
the dynamic investment decisions involve the realization of investment goals
at the end of every period. Usually investors attach diﬀerent importance to the
yields of each period, rather than consider the terminal wealth only. In this paper
we formulate a multi-period stochastic programming model for bond portfolio
management, in which risk attitude is measured by shortfall cost. So that the
preferences of investors to the yields of diﬀerent periods can be incorporated.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the model formulation.
Section 3 provides the scenario generation process, in which interest rates scenarios are generated on the basis of Black-Derman-Toy model. In Section 4, an
application of the model is illustrated and the result is compared with that of
ﬁxed-mix model. We conclude this paper with some insights and comments.

Model Formulation
Variables and Parameters

In the model we use variables to represent the buying and selling of bonds,
investment in the riskless asset and holdings of bonds in the portfolio. Investment
decisions are of face value. The bid and ask prices of a kind of bond are assumed
to be the same for convenience. We deﬁne the following notations.
Parameters of the Model
St : set of scenarios anticipated at time t, for t = 0, 1, ..., T . These could be
scenarios of interest rates, prices and so on. We use st to index scenarios
from the set St .
lt : paths of scenarios that are resolved (i.e., all information becomes known)
until period t, where t = 1, 2, .., T .
J: set of available bonds, with cardinality m.
c0 : riskless asset available at t = 0.
(b0j )m
j=1 : vectors denoting the initial holdings of bonds.
(p0j )m
j=1 : vectors of bond prices at t = 0. These prices are known with certainty.
(ptj (lt ))m
vectors of bond prices realized
j=1 for all lt ∈ Pt and t = 1, 2, ..., T :
at t. These prices depend on the path of scenarios followed from 0 to t.
(ktj (lt , st ))m
vectors of cash accrual factors during the
j=1 for t = 0, 1, ..., T :
interval from t to t + 1.

878

L. Yu et al.

rt (lt , st ) for t = 0, 1, ..., T : short term riskless reinvestment rates during the
interval from t to t + 1. These rates depend on the path followed up to t,
and are conditioned on the scenario to be realized during the interval from
t to t + 1.
First-stage Variables at t = 0.
(x0j )m
j=1 : vector denoting the face value bought of each bond.
(y0j )m
j=1 : vector denoting the face value sold of each bond.
(z0j )m
j=1 : vector denoting the face value held of each bond.
v0 : amount invested in the riskless asset.
Time-staged Variables.
(xtj (lt ))m
j=1 : vector denoting the face values bought of each bond.
(ytj (lt ))m
j=1 : vector denoting the face value sold of each bond.
(ztj (lt ))m
j=1 : vector denoting the face values held in the portfolio.
vt (lt ): amount invested in the riskless asset.
2.2

Model Formulation

There are two basic kind of constraints in stochastic programming models for
portfolio optimization. One expresses cashﬂow accounting for the riskless asset,
and the other is an inventory balance equation for each bond at all time periods.
First-stage Constraints. At the ﬁrst stage(i.e., at time t = 0)all prices are
known with certainty. The cashﬂow accounting equation deals with conservation
of the initial holdings of the riskless asset(i.e., cash):
m

m

p0j y0j =

c0 +
j=1

p0j x0j + v0 .

(1)

j=1

For each bond j ∈ J in the portfolio we have an inventory balance Constraint:
b0j + x0j = y0j + z0j .

(2)

Time-staged Constraints. Decisions made at any time period t, after t = 0,
depend on the path lt and are conditioned on the scenarios St anticipated at t.
Hence at each time instance t we have one constraint for each path in Pt and
each scenario in St . These decisions also depend on the investment decisions
made at previous periods.

Objective Function. In some papers about dynamic portfolio management,
the objective functions adopt the form of utility optimization (Hakansson and
Ziemba (1995)[9], Zenios et al.(1998) [4]). The nonlinear objective functions result in too complex optimization problems which are diﬃcult to resolve, especially when the number of the variables and constraints is large. In our model, we
use shortfall costs to character the risk attitude of the portfolio manager. For
each time period, we set a goal wealth on the account of the manager’s judge.
The realized wealth may be greater than or less than them. The shortfalls are
penalized in the form of costs. To represent the importance that we attach to
diﬀerent time periods, we set diﬀerent weights to the costs. The objective of
the problem is to maximize the expected wealth at the end of the investment
horizon, minus the weighted sum of the shortfall costs (All are discounted to the
present value). It can be given by

πlt denotes the probability of scenario path lt . W (lT ) is the terminal wealth at
the end of period T if the scenario path lT is realized. It can be denoted as follow
W (lT ) = rT −1 (lT −1 , sT −1 )vT −1 (lT −1 )

λt is the weight we set to the shortfall cost of time period t. It represents the
importance of the goal wealth we attach to that period. The nearer the periods
to the beginning, the more the cost weights are that correspond to them. ct,lt
denotes shortfall cost of period t when lt happened.

Scenario Generation

Scenarios of uncertain economic factors play fundamental role in stochastic programming models for portfolio optimization, which determine whether the models are valid. Here we generate scenarios of interest rates using the interest
model of Black et.al[8], then show how prices can be resolved at diﬀerent states.
In the one-factor interest rate model of Black et.al, the current structure of
long rates and their estimated volatilities are used to construct a tree of possible
future short rates. This tree can then be used to value interest-rate-sensitive
securities. Now we explain how to price the bond at some future time period τ .
Possible state of short rates σ at τ can be obtained using binomial lattice. Let

880

L. Yu et al.

Sσ denote the set of interest rate scenarios that emanate from state σ of the
binomial lattice at some future time period τ . Let also rts be the short rate at
time period t(τ ≤ t ≤ T ) associated with scenario s ∈ Sσ , and Cts be the cash
ﬂow generated by the security at period t under the same scenario s. The price
of bond is given by the expected present value of the cash ﬂows Ct generated by
the security from t = τ until maturity T , as
Pτσ =

|Sσ |

T
s∈Sσ t=τ +1

t−1
i=τ

Cts
(1 + ρris )

.

(6)

In this formulation, ρ is the option adjusted premium(OAP), a factor that incorporates the the risk premia due to defaults, illiquidity, prepayments, lapse and
other risks that are relevant to the security; see Babbel and Zenios (1992)[10].
The OAP for a given security is the solution of the following nonlinear equation
in ρ:
P0 =

1
|S0 |

T
s∈S0 t=1

t−1
i=0

Cts
(1 + ρris )

.

(7)

Here, S0 denote the set of scenarios that emanate from the root of the binomial
lattice, and P0 is the present price of the security considered.
Making the assumption that this risk premium remains constant until τ , we
compute the option adjusted price of the security Pστ as
Pτσ =

s∈Sσ t=τ +1

where ρ0 denotes the option adjusted premium computed by solving (7).

An Application

We apply our model to the following bond portfolio management problem in the
China market. Three bonds are selected to invest in after analysis of the bond
market. They are two treasury bonds, 96(6) and 99(5), one corporate bond, 98
Oil (see Table 1.). The beginning of the investment horizon is July 1st, 2003,
end in July 1st, 2006. The compositions of the portfolios are determined at the
beginning of each year period based on scenarios of riskless short rates and bond
prices.
First we calculate short rates using the structure of long rates and their
estimated volatilities. According to the data from China Government Securities
Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation(www.chinabond.com.cn), we obtain
the treasury bond yield (adopting the term structure of July 1st, 2003) and the
yield volatilities, as in Table 2.
Using the method presented by Black et al., we can ﬁnd the short rates on
tree nodes step by step. Figure 1. displays the full tree of short rates at one year
intervals that matches the term structure of Table 1.

Fig. 1. Short Rates that Match the Term Structure of Table 1

The prices of the bonds at the beginning of the horizon are known(In July 1st,
2003, the prices of 96(6), 99(5) and 98 Oil are 127.37, 102.94 and 109.38 respectively.). They are uncertain in subsequent years which are mainly determined by
short interest rates. To get the future prices, the option adjusted premium(OAP)
of the bonds must be known. Using (7), we know the OAP of 96(6), 99(5) and

882

L. Yu et al.

98 Oil is 0.9710, 0.9836, and 0.9925, respectively. Then the future prices of the
bonds under diﬀerent scenario paths can be obtained.
Having known the riskless short rates and prices of the bonds at diﬀerent
periods, we can solve the model. Assume the investment at initiate period is
10,000, and goal wealth of each period are 10300, 10600, 11000 respectively.
Setting the weights of shortfall costs of each period is 50, 30, and 20 in turn.
Then the expected wealth that we can get at the end of each period are 10316.23,
10695.20, and 10979.94, respectively.
Comparing the result of the dynamic stochastic programming model with
that of a ﬁxed-mix model, which is commonly used in the market, we can identify
the eﬀect of our model. There are previous literature reported the results of
comparing the performance of stochastic programming models with others. The
comparison is a complex task, as it involves solving a large number of stochastic
programs.
Now we apply the ﬁxed mix model to the bond portfolio management problem
presented above. It has the same objective function with the dynamic stochastic
programming model, for the reason to guarantee that decision maker has the
same risk attitude.
The performance of ﬁxed mix model is listed in Table 3, which is compared
with that of stochastic programming model. Comparing the wealth at the end of
every period under diﬀerent models, we can see the dynamic stochastic programming approach weakly dominates the ﬁxed mix approach. It is also illustrated by
other tests over a large number of realistic scenarios created by means of simulation. This indicates the former has better ability to adapt to the information
in the scenario tree. We expect that the degree of dominance would increase if
the number of periods in the decision model is increased.

Conclusions

Dynamic stochastic programming models are extremely versatile. They can incorporate transaction costs, cash infusions or withdrawals, risk of default and do
not depend on assumptions for temporal independence or normality of returns.
They are powerful tools to deal with complex bond portfolio management.
When using stochastic programming models, scenario generations play important roles, which determine the validity of the models. A few methods have

been presented to model economic factors and asset returns, such as statistical
modelling with the Value-at-Risk approach(Jamshidian and Zhu (1997)[11], Consiglio and Zenios(2001)[12]), vector autoregressive models (Boender (1997)[13]),
etc.. Future research may consider to evaluate diﬀerent methods in generating
scenarios of the uncertainties in the multi-period models.
