Abstract. Our research subject in the present paper is concerned with
the minimization of multicast delay variation under the multicast endto-end delay constraint. The delay- and delay variation-bounded multicast tree (DVBMT) problem is NP-complete for high-bandwidth delaysensitive applications in a point-to-point communication network. The
problem is ﬁrst deﬁned and discussed in [3]. In this paper, comprehensive
empirical study shows that our proposed algorithm performs very well
in terms of average delay variation of the solution that it generates as
compared to the existing algorithm.

Introduction

In real-time communications, messages must be transmitted to their destination
nodes within a limited amount of time, otherwise the messages will be nulliﬁed.
Computer networks have to guarantee an upper bound on the end-to-end delay
from the source to each destination. This is known as the multicast end-to-end
delay problem [1,5]. In addition, the multicast tree must also guarantee a bound
on the variation among the delays along the individual source-destination paths
[3]. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for DVBMT problem. The time
complexity of our algorithm is O(mn2 ).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a formal
deﬁnition of the problem. Our proposed algorithm is presented in section 3 and
simulation results are presented in section 4. Section 5 concludes this paper.

Problem Deﬁnition

We consider a computer network represented by a directed graph G = (V, E),
where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of links. Each link (i, j) ∈ E is associated with delay d(i,j) . Given a network G, we deﬁne a path as sequence

of nodes u, i, j, . . . , k, v, such that (u, i), (i, j), . . ., and (k, v) belong to
E. Let P (u, v) = {(u, i), (i, j), . . . , (k, v)} denote the path from node u to
node v. If all elements of the path are distinct, then we say that it is a simple path. We deﬁne the length of the path P (u, v), denoted by n(P (u, v)),
as a number of links in P (u, v). Let
be a binary relation on P (u, v) deﬁned by (a, b)
(c, d) ↔ n(P (u, b)) ≤ n(P (u, d)), ∀ (a, b), (c, d) ∈ P (u, v).
(P (u, v), ) is a totally ordered set. For given a source node s ∈ V and a destination node d ∈ V , (2s⇒d , ∞) is the set of all possible paths from s to d.
(2s⇒d , ∞) = { Pk (s, d) | all possible paths from s to d, ∀ s, d ∈ V, ∀ k ∈ Λ },
where Λ is a index set. Both cost and delay of an arbitrary path Pk are assumed
to be a function from (2s⇒d , ∞) to a nonnegative real number. Since (Pk , ) is
a totally ordered set, if there exists a bijective function fk then Pk is isomorphic to Nn(Pk ) . fk : Pk −→Nn(Pk ) . We deﬁne a function of delay along the
n(P )
path φD (Pk ) = r=1k df −1 (r) , ∀ Pk ∈ (2s⇒d , ∞) . (2s⇒d , supD) is the set of
k
paths from s to d for which the end-to-end delay is bounded by supD. Therefore
(2s⇒d , supD) ⊆ (2s⇒d , ∞). For multicast communications, messages need to be
delivered to all receivers in the set M ⊆ V \ {s} which is called multicast group,
where |M | = m. The path traversed by messages from the source s to a multicast
receiver, mi , is given by P (s, mi ). Thus multicast routing tree can be deﬁned
as T (s, M ) = mi ∈M P (s, mi ), and messages is sent from s to destination of M
using T (s, M ). The multicast delay variation, δ, is the maximum diﬀerence between the end-to-end delays along the paths from the source to any two destination nodes. δ = max{|φD (P (s, mi )) − φD (P (s, mj ))|, ∀ mi , mj ∈ M, i = j}. The
DVBMT problem is to ﬁnd the tree that satisﬁes min{δα | ∀ mi ∈ M, ∀ P (s, mi ) ∈
(2s⇒mi , supD), ∀ P (s, mi ) ⊆ Tα , ∀ α ∈ Λ}, where Tα denotes any multicast tree
spanning M ∪ {s}, and is known to be NP-complete [3].

An Illustration on New Heuristic

The proposed algorithm consists of a core node selection part and the multicast tree construction part. When candidate of core node is several nodes,
the DDVCA [4] randomly choose a core node among candidates but our proposed algorithm is going to overcome a shortcoming of the DDVCA. See the
Fig. 1. In selecting such a core node, we use the minimum delay path algorithm. The proposed algorithm calculates the minimum delay from each destination node and source node to each other node in the network. For each
node, our method calculates the associated delay variation between the node
and each destination node. We check whether any destination node is visited
in the path from source node to each other node. If any destination node is
visited, then the proposed algorithm records in ‘passvi ’ data structure. And we
conform supD and select nodes with the minimum delay variation as the candidates of core node. As you shown in Fig. 2, our algorithm chooses the core node
with min{φD (P (s, vi )) − min{passvi }}. The time complexity of the proposed
algorithm is O(mn2 ), which is the same as that of the DDVCA.

Simulation Model and Result

We now describe some numerical results with which we compare the performance for the new parameter. The proposed one is implemented in C++. We
consider networks with number of nodes (n) which is equal to 50 and 100. We
generate 10 diﬀerent networks for each size given above. The random networks
used in our experiments are directed, symmetric, and connected, where each
node in networks has the probability of links (Pe ) equal to 0.3 [2]. We randomly
selected a source node. The destination nodes are picked uniformly from the
set of nodes in the network topology. Moreover, the destination nodes in the
multicast group will occupy 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% of the overall nodes on
the network, respectively. We randomly choose supD. We simulate 1000 times
(10 × 100 = 1000) for each n and Pe = 0.3. For the performance comparison, we

Conclusion

In this paper, we consider the transmission of a message that guarantees certain
bounds on the end-to-end delays from a source to a set of destinations as well as
on the multicast delay variations among these delays over a computer network. It
has been shown that the DDVCA [4] outperforms the DVMA [3] slightly in terms
of the multicast delay variation for the constructed tree. The comprehensive
computer simulation results show that the proposed scheme obtains the better
minimum multicast delay variation than the DDVCA.
