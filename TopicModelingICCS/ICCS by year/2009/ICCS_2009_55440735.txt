Abstract. We present a continuous time/discrete space model of bioﬁlm
growth, starting from the semi-discrete master equation. The probabilities of biomass movement into neighboring sites depend on the local
biomass density and on the biomass density in the target site such that
spatial movement only takes place if (i) locally not enough space is available to accommodate newly produced biomass and (ii) the target site has
capacity to accommodate new biomass. This mimics the rules employed
by Cellular Automata models of bioﬁlms. Grid reﬁnement leads formally
to a degenerate parabolic equation. We show that a set of transition rules
can be found such that a previously studied ad hoc density-dependent
diﬀusion-reaction model of bioﬁlm formation is approximated well.

Introduction

Most bacterial populations live as microbial depositions on immersed surfaces
(called substratum in the bioﬁlm context). These bioﬁlm colonies are not a consequence of active or even deliberate aggregation of microorganisms but of immobilization and cell division. Once cells become sessile they start to produce an
extracellular polymeric network in which they are themselves embedded (EPS).
Thus, they are heavily restricted in their mobility. Living in bioﬁlm colonies is
quite diﬀerent from living as a suspended population. For example, the colony
oﬀers protection against mechanical washout or antibiotic attacks.
As long as the conditions are locally favorable to sustain microbial growth,
cells will increase in size and eventually divide. The local expansion of a bioﬁlm
is primarily driven by this growth process. As new cells require more space, the
neighbors must make way. The bacteria closer to the food source grow faster
than the bacteria further away, e.g. the ones close to the substratum. This can
lead to the characteristic ”bioﬁlm mushroom structures” [10] which appear as
if the bioﬁlm is growing toward the region with higher food concentrations. In

Fig. 1. Schematics of one time step of biomass spreading in cellular automata models,
cf [12,13], (left to right): If the biomass in a grid cell approaches or exceeds maximum
packing density (yellow grid cells), mass is moved into neighboring sites. If empty
neighboring grid cell are found the excess biomass is placed there (grey), otherwise
re-shuﬄing takes place (existing biomass is placed in a neighboring cell [grey-yellow],
the excess biomass of which is placed in a suitable empty site).

contrast to chemotaxis, however, this is not an active movement up the nutrient
gradient but a consequence of the fact that life under conditions of abundance
is more conducive to population growth than under conditions of starvation.
The most widespread technique in modern bioﬁlm modeling, and in fact the
modeling concept that ﬁrst was used to describe multi-dimensional bioﬁlm
formation are cellular automata, e.g. [2,7,12,13,14], cf Fig. 1. Deterministic continuum models include the density-dependent diﬀusion model [3], which is formulated as a traditional spatially structured population and resource dynamics
model. Despite the good phenomenological agreement between diﬀerent model
approaches [10,17] no attempts have been made so far to relate these seemingly
so diﬀerent models to each other. We formulate here a discrete space, continuous time model, starting from the master equation that describes the probability
that bacteria move from one site on a regular lattice into a neighboring site and
vice versa. This movement follows stochastic rules which qualitatively mimic
those in [12]. The probability of biomass movement into neighboring sites has
to account for two particular aspects: (i) It depends on the availability of space
in that site (volume ﬁlling, cf [11]), and (ii) as long as there is capacity to accommodate new biomass locally the incentive to move into a neighboring site is
small (quenching). Semi-discrete master equation models lend themselves in an
often straightforward manner to deriving deterministic continuous models. Our
goal is to derive from this spatially discrete description the phenomenological
nonlinear diﬀusion model [3]. In fact, since this was originally introduced in an
ad hoc fashion, the semi-discrete approach described here can be understood as
an a posteriori derivation of this model.
Semi-discrete master equation models for spatially structured populations
have been developed for many diﬀerent types of migration in ecology and cell
biology, such as aggregation and (chemo-)taxis, cf. [1,9,11,16]. The advantage
of the approach is that phenomenological migration rules are easily formulated
based on assumptions on the individual level, while the well-developed machinery
of diﬀerential equations can be used to study the model on the population level.
The bioﬁlm model presented here has qualitative properties that are distinct
from other master equation models, since it has to account for the properties (i)

and (ii) above. Moreover, since the driving force behind spatial expansion of the
bioﬁlm is population growth, this needs to be included in every bioﬁlm model.

The Spatially Discrete Master Equation

We consider an equidistant discretization of the real line and denote by Ti± the
probability that biomass moves from the ith grid cell into neighbor cell i ± 1,
cf. Fig. 2. We follow common practice and equate the dependent variable ui
with the population density in the ith site on the lattice. Like most bioﬁlm
models, we subsume EPS and cells in this variable. Since the site’s capacity to
accommodate bacteria is limited, we normalize the density with respect to the
maximum density, i.e. we interpret it as the volume fraction of site i occupied by
the population. Thus, 0 ≤ ui ≤ 1 is mandatory. The Ti± can also be understood
as mass transfer rates. The master equation reads
dui
+
−
= Ti−1
ui−1 + Ti+1
ui+1 − (Ti+ + Ti− )ui + Ki ui ,
dt

(1)

where Ti± = αqi± with a scaling factor α that depends on time-scale and length
scale, i.e. distance between two sites h. More speciﬁcally, for diﬀusion problems
α scales with h2 , such that limh→0 αh2 = α0 > 0. The probability qi± of a jump
from location i to location i ± 1 depends on the densities in both sites, i.e. on ui
and on ui±1 . We make the general ansatz
qi± = q(ui )p(ui±1 ).

(2)

In cellular automaton bioﬁlm models like [12], spatial spreading of biomass takes
place if the local biomass density ui reaches or exceeds the maximum cell packing
density, i.e. u ≈ 1. Then a given or randomly chosen amount of the local biomass
density is placed in a neighboring grid cell according to some stochastic local rule.
In the continuum model [3], on the other hand, the spatial spreading is described
deterministically: biomass is not moved into neighboring sites as long as newly
produced biomass still easily ﬁts into the local site. As ui increases and gets
close to 1, Ti± increases. Moreover, the bigger the volume fraction in the target
site, the smaller is Ti± . Thus, we assume q(u) to be a monotonously increasing
function and p(u) to be a monotonously decreasing function. Assuming suﬃcient
smoothness, we have for p, q the properties

Fig. 2. Schematic of movement of biomass between neighboring lattice cells. The probability for biomass to move from cell i into cell i ± 1 is denoted by Ti± etc.

q (u) ≥ 0,

q(1) = 1,

p(0) = 1,

p (u) ≤ 0,

p(1) = 0.

In (1), Ki is the net biomass production rate in grid cell i. This is the actual force driving the expansion of bioﬁlm colonies. If Ki is a positive constant
the model describes unrestricted exponential growth. In most bioﬁlm systems,
growth is eventually not everywhere unlimited. Limitations can be induced by
local limitation of nutrients, iron, oxygen (aerobic case) etc. or by large amounts
of growth inhibitors such as protonated lactic acids, proton ions [i.e. low pH], or
oxygen (anaerobic case). Modeling these eﬀects is conceptually straightforward.
Each growth limiting substrate is described by an additional transport-reaction
equation, which is coupled with (1) in the reaction term Ki . The growth limitation mechanisms listed above are due to an increase of biomass in the system.
For example, the more bacteria there are in the system the more nutrients are
depleted, etc. In many bioﬁlm systems the net growth rate can become negative,
e.g if nutrients are locally completely depleted and natural cell loss dominates.
Under this light, assuming Ki = const is the most challenging case because
biomass production is highest and, thus, biomass spreading most pronounced.
The relationship between the spatially discrete and a continuous description
is established by passing the grid cell size h in (1) to the continuous limit, h → 0.
Assuming enough smoothness we approximate q(ui±1 ) and p(ui±1 ) in the usual
way by Taylor polynomials about ui ,
q(ui±1 ) = q(ui ) + (ui±1 − ui )q (ui ) + (ui±1 − ui )2 q (ui )/2 + O((ui±1 − ui )3 )
p(ui±1 ) = p(ui ) + (ui±1 − ui )p (ui ) + (ui±1 − ui )2 p (ui )/2 + O((ui±1 − ui )3 ).
Interpreting ui as a quantity in the cell center xi , we can interpolate the grid
function ui by a continuous function u with u(t, xi ) = ui (t). For given t we
approximate u(t, xi±1 ) by Taylor polynomials
u(t, xi±1 ) = ui (t) ± h

An Inverse Problem

A density-dependent diﬀusion-reaction model for bioﬁlm formation was introduced in [3] and has been studied since numerically and analytically in its original and extended versions, e.g. in [4,5,6,8]. The pecularity of that model lies in
the form of the nonlinear diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(u), namely
D(u) = δua (1 − u)−b ,

a, b ≥ 1.

(7)

For small u
1 this type of nonlinear diﬀusion acts like the porous medium
equation, while for large u ≈ 1 it shows fast diﬀusion eﬀects. The interplay of
both eﬀects is required to describe a growing bioﬁlm. It was shown in [6] that
solutions of this model remain bounded by and separated from unity, u < 1 − η,
for a η > 0, as long as the bioﬁlm/water interface stays away from the boundary
of the domain somewhere. Thus, the singularity is never reached. It follows then
with standard arguments about degenerate diﬀusion-reaction equations, cf [15],
that initial data with compact support imply solutions with compact support. In
our application this means that the interface between bioﬁlm and surrounding
liquid is sharp and propagates at ﬁnite speed.
We try to ﬁnd jump probabilities q(u) and p(u) with (3) such that the
diﬀusion-reaction model (6) with (7) is recovered. This is a constrained scalar
boundary value problem for two unknown functions. It is transformed into an
ordinary boundary value problem by introducing one more assumption on q
and/or p. We propose
p(u) := 1 − uq(u).
(8)
It is easily veriﬁed that p satisﬁes (3) if q does and vice versa. With (8) equation
(5) becomes the linear ordinary diﬀerential equation
uq (u) + q(u) = D(u),

(9)

which degenerates for u = 0. Moreover, the right hand side of (9) blows up for
u = 1. We introduce the following regularization with small parameter > 0,
which was already used in the analysis of the bioﬁlm model (6), (7) in [6,8].

The unique solution q of the regularized initial value problem

(11)

is obtained as the strictly increasing function
q (u) =

1

D (s)ds,
0

which is bounded for every > 0 and 0 ≤ u ≤ 1. Moreover, 1 < q (1) < ∞ for
every small enough . Thus, continuity and monotonicity imply that there exists

740

a u
˜ < 1 such that q (˜
u ) = 1, while q (u) < 1 for u < u
˜ and q (u) > 1 for
u>u
˜ . Hence, q (u) does not belong to the desired class of functions
G := {g ∈ C([0, 1]) : g(0) = 0,

g(u1 ) ≤ g(u2 ) ∀ u1 < u2 }.

g(1) = 1,

Thus the problem of ﬁnding an exact solution of (11) in G is ill-posed and the best
we can hope for is to ﬁnd a function r (u) ∈ G that solves (11) approximately.
Thus, we are looking for the function in G with the smallest distance from q ,
min q − r 2 .

The ﬁrst integral vanishes for r(u) = r (u) as deﬁned above, and, since q (u) > 1
and r(u) ≤ 1 for u > u
˜ , the second integral becomes minimal if r(u) = 1
for u > u
˜ . Passing the regularization parameter to the limit, → 0, then

Function φ(u) is the strictly increasing solution of the initial value problem
(9) with q(0) = 0 and u
˜ is the unique value such that φ(˜
u) = 1. Note that
limu→1 φ(u) = ∞. Obviously r ∈ G. We choose q(u) := r(u). It remains to
validate how good this approximation is for practical purposes. We recall from
[6] that the solution of (6) with (7) satisﬁes u < 1 − η for a η > 0, which depends
on the parameters and the initial data. Thus, if u
˜ > 1 − η then (6) with (7) is
equivalent with the PDE model that one obtains from the lattice model with
jump probability q(u) = r(u) from (14). Otherwise they are equivalent as long as
the solutions remain bounded by u
˜, i.e. for a ﬁnite time interval. Unfortunately,
the proof in [6] does not allow to compute quantitative estimates for η, so that
we have to fall back on comparisons with computer simulations. For example,
in the 2D and 3D simulations of the single-species growth model in [4,5,6], the
solution reached values above u ≈ 0.99 but remained below u ≈ 0.9999, thus, we
have the numerical estimates ηˆ > 10−4 . In all three cases the exponents in the
biomass diﬀusion coeﬃcient were a = b = 4 and the bioﬁlm motility coeﬃcient

On the other hand the value η˜ := 1−˜

all cases, u˜ remained above the maximum values of u in the numerical simulations
reported above, i.e ηˆ > 1 − u˜ =: η˜ by at least one order of magnitude. Thus
the nonlinear diﬀusion-reaction model that is derived from the semi-discrete
master equation (1) with the jump probabilities Ti± (u) = αq(ui )p(ui±1 ), q(u) :=

Note that assuming p(u) ≡ 1 instead of (8), i.e. transition probability does not

In i = 1, i = n, j = 1, j = m, (18) is corrected such that no exchange

Neumann conditions. We set in the ”virtual grid points” u0,j := u1,j , un+1,j :=

nm ordinary diﬀerential equations is integrated by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg

We use a 128×128 grid. Cells are inoculated in three spherical pockets around
the grid cells (i, j) = (1, 1) [radius ρ = 0.1n, initial biomass density u0 = 0.8],
(i, j) = (n/2, 1) [ρ = 0.11n, u0 = 0.75], and (i, j) = (n, 1) [ρ = 0.12n, u0 = 0.7].
We take q(u) from (14) and p(u) = 1 − uq(u). For the coeﬃcients of D(u) we
pick a = b = 4 and δ = 10−12 m2 /d, for the biomass production rate K = 6/d.

solidify, i.e. u increases, ﬁrst without notable expansion. Later, the colonies expand spherically. Eventually, neighboring colonies merge and a homogeneous
thick layer of biomass develops that expands exponentially. This is a consequence of the abundance of food and agrees with all other bioﬁlm models. The
simulation is stopped before the entire lattice is ﬁlled with biomass. The biomass
density remains clearly below the cut-oﬀ value u
˜ that was computed above.
In order to investigate how the solution of the spatially discrete model changes
with grid reﬁnement, we repeat and compare the simulations on grids of size
2k × 2k , where k = 4, ..., 9. Table 1 shows the convergence of the grid reﬁnement
study. This is visually supported by Fig. 5 where the bioﬁlm/water interface is
plotted for subsequent grids. These agree well within plotting accuracy.

Conclusion, Discussion, and Future Work

Spatially discrete master equations are routinely used to derive population models that can be studied with the well developed machinery of partial diﬀerential
equations. We use this approach to derive a highly nonlinear diﬀusion-reaction
model of bioﬁlm expansion. The underlying mechanisms are quite diﬀerent than
for other biological systems. Most notably, spatial spreading of biomass is driven
by production of new biomass and takes place only if locally no space is available
to accommodate newly produced cells. In the continuous limit this is rendered
by a combination of degenerate and fast diﬀusion. In numerical simulations we
could show that the spatially discrete master equation and the continuous model
agree well. The assumptions that we made to deﬁne the probabilities for biomass
movement mimic the stochastic rules that are used in cellular automata bioﬁlm
models. Therefore, we understand the master equation model as a link between
discrete stochastic and continuous deterministic bioﬁlm models.
In our current study the equivalence of spatially discrete and continuous model
rests on empirical computer simulations. While it follows from continuity that
both models agree exactly for some time, the question how long this equivalence

744

is valid certainly warrants more rigorous mathematical analysis. On the modeling
side, future research will involve the extension of the approach to mixed-culture
bioﬁlm systems and to bioﬁlm systems with preferred spreading directions, e.g.
bioﬁlms that predominantly creep over the substratum rather than forming patchy
bioﬁlm colonies. Moreover, for realistic applications the bioﬁlm population models
need to be coupled with models of resource dynamics, as already indicated above.
