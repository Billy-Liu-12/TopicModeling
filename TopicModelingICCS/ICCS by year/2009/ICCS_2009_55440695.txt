Abstract. We propose algorithms for computational upscaling of ﬂow
from porescale (microscale) to lab scale (mesoscale). In particular, we
solve Navier-Stokes equations in complex pore geometries and average
their solutions to derive properties of ﬂow relevant at lab scale such
as permeability and inertia coeﬃcients. We discuss two variants of traditional discretizations: a simple algorithm which works well in periodic
isotropic media and can be used when coarse approximations are needed,
and a more complex one which is well suited for nonisotropic geometries.
Convergence of solutions and averaging techniques are major concerns
but these can be relaxed if only mesoscopic parameters are needed. The
project is a proof-of-concept computational laboratory for porous media which delivers data needed for mesoscale simulations by performing
microscale computational simulations.

Introduction

Computational modeling of ﬂow in porous media such as aquifers and oil-gas
reservoirs has been constrained until recently to the scales of physical observation and of experiments such as Darcy-scale (lab-scale ≡ mesoscale). For simulations in large porous reservoirs it has been necessary to upscale the models
and parameters of ﬂow to macroscale.
In this paper we pursue the upscaling from microscale, i.e., porescale to
mesoscale (lab or Darcy scale). While relevant mathematical theory was developed
decades ago via homogenization [1] and volume–averaging [2], the computational
modeling at porescale had remained unfeasible until recently when advances in
micro-imaging were accompanied by increases in computational power and development of discrete models such as network and lattice models [3,4,5,6].
In this paper we are interested in continuum models, i.e., traditional discretizations of partial diﬀerential equations adapted to porescale such as studies in [7,8].
We investigate conditions under which simple algorithms can be used eﬃciently
to deliver reliable quantitative information from microscale to mesoscale. Our
project can be seen as a ﬁrst step of a computational laboratory for modeling

ﬂow over a range of scales; the model at mesoscale can be further upscaled to
macroscale following e.g. [9,10].
The following problem is of interest for stationary incompressible viscous ﬂow.
It is well known that linear ﬂow models are not valid beyond certain Reynolds
numbers [11,12,13,14,15,16]. At porescale the relevant linear and nonlinear models are the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, respectively. At mesoscale those
are Darcy and non-Darcy models where it is now believed that in the nonlinear laminar regime it is the inertia rather than micro-turbulence eﬀects that
are most important. However, the identiﬁcation of a particular transition regime
between Darcy and non-Darcy ﬂow model as well as a universal mathematical
form of an anisotropic non-Darcy model are still a subject of current research
and controversies [2,16,17,18,19,20,21], and the values of associated coeﬃcients
reported in literature vary signiﬁcantly.
Consider then a scenario in which data for linear ﬂow at Darcy scale, i.e. permeability K, is known, but no data for modeling inertia eﬀects (denoted by β) is
available. We propose to i) use a computational porescale model with inertia eﬀects
from which we ii) derive data β for nonlinear models at Darcy scale. In i)-ii) we focus on 2D porescale models with isotropic mesoscale but iii) one can extend i)-ii) to
anisotropic nonlinear laws at mesoscale that emerge from complicated anisotropic
porescale geometries, and thereby aid current theoretical developments.
The main diﬃculties of i)-iii) are the following. First, standard discretization
techniques for Navier-Stokes equations are well studied but their use in complex
geometries requires ﬁne grids and is in general nontrivial. Second, calculating
average quantities from computational data is only superﬁcially straightforward
since the stability of results with respect to grids and algorithms over a large
range of Reynolds numbers must be ensured. Next, as concerns iii), realistic
data on porescale geometries such as [5] should be used, and their uncertainty,
and dependence of results on averaging regions needs to be accounted for. Finally, computational eﬃciency of the proposed “on-demand” porescale modeling
laboratory must be considered.
In this paper we focus on a proof-of-concept realization of i)-ii); details on
iii) will be addressed in a forthcoming paper. In Sections 2 and 3 we describe
the relevant physical and computational models, respectively. In Section 4 we
propose the method of upscaling and in Section 5 we discuss the results.

Computational Models

Let Ω ⊂ IRd , d = 2, 3, be an open bounded domain occupied by porous medium
and the ﬂuid within. Let ΩF Ω be the part of Ω occupied by the ﬂuid, that is,
the domain of ﬂow, and let rock (solid) part be ΩR = Ω \ ΩF . Let ∂Ω denote the
boundary of Ω, and let Γ = ∂ΩF \ ∂Ω be the interior boundary (between rock
and ﬂuid domains) while the external boundary of ﬂow ∂ΩF ∩ ∂Ω is divided into
inﬂow Γin and outﬂow Γout parts. We also denote by η the unit outward normal
to the boundary and by τ the unit tangent. For simplicity no special notation is
used for numerical solutions.

Flow at porescale. We consider an incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid of velocity u
and pressure p ﬂowing in ΩF . The ﬂuid’s viscosity is denoted by μ and the density ρ ≡ 1. We consider ﬂow driven primarily by external boundary conditions,
such as in a lab core. We prescribe velocity at the inlet and impose an outﬂow condition at the outlet. On internal boundaries we assume no-slip condition
u = 0. We assume that the Reynolds number Re is correlated to the magnitude
of inﬂow velocities.
At microscale (porescale), for steady-state ﬂow, in the absence of forces and
mass source/sink terms, the momentum and mass conservation in Eulerian frame
are expressed by Navier-Stokes equations and continuity equation [14]
u · ∇u − μ u = −∇p,
∇ · u = 0.

(1)
(2)

In 2D (d = 2) it is convenient to consider the formulation in terms of the vorticity
vector ω = ∇ × u and the (scalar) stream function ψ deﬁned by u = ∇ × ψ [14].
Taking ∇× equation (1) and noticing ∇ × (∇p) = 0, one obtains the system
u · ∇ω = μΔω,
Δψ = −ω.

(3)
(4)

The last equation follows from standard calculation ω = ∇ × (∇ × ψ) = ∇(∇ ·
ψ) − Δψ, which, with (2), for 2D ﬂow reduces to (4). We can get p from
− Δp = (∇(u · ∇)) · u = 2(

∂ux ∂uy
∂ux ∂uy
−
)
∂x ∂y
∂y ∂x

(5)

For small Re the nonlinear convective terms associated with u· are dropped
from (1) and (3) and we have the (linear) Stokes approximation
−μ

u = −∇p,

(6)

which is valid when viscous eﬀects dominate in the ﬂow. For larger Re the
inertia eﬀects associated with u· cannot be neglected. We recall that, up to the
deﬁnition/units of characteristic quantities, the linear laminar ﬂow regime is for
Re < 1, the nonlinear regime is for 1 ≤ Re < 100, and that turbulence may
occur for Re ≥ 100 [13,16]; however, turbulence rarely occurs in porous media.
Flow at Darcy scale. At mesoscale the boundaries between ΩF and ΩR are no
more recognized, One considers an average pressure P :=< p > and velocity
(ﬂux) U :=< u > where the averages over a volume V (x) centered at x ∈ Ω
1
q(y)dy. (In what follows we
are deﬁned as < q >V ≡< q > (x) ≡ |V (x)|
V (x)
drop subscript V ). Conservation of mass after averaging yields ∇· < u >= 0;
note that derivatives in ∇ are taken with respect to large scale variable x. The
ﬂow in Ω at mesoscale is driven by boundary conditions which are averages of
porescale external boundary conditions.

Darcy’s law is a linear momentum equation at mesoscale which can be proven
[22,1] to be an average of Stokes ﬂow (6)
μK−1 < u >= −∇ < p > .

(7)

where the values of a symmetric permeability tensor K are measured in a lab and
have been obtained experimentally for many porous materials [16]. K reﬂects
geometry at porescale, and K−1 measures resistance of porous medium to the
ﬂow. For heterogenous media K = K(x), for isotropic media K = KI. Due to
large viscous dissipation and interstitial eﬀects common in porous media, Darcy’s
law is a good approximation for a large class of ﬂow phenomena.
In the nonlinear laminar regime with signiﬁcant inertia, averaging (1) yields
K−1 (< u >) < u >= −∇ < p > .

(8)

The 1D model for K ﬁrst proposed by Forchheimer [11] was K−1 (U ) := μK −1 +
β|U |, while multidimensional isotropic version [12,16,13,15] reads
K−1 (< u >) < u >:= K−1 μ + β| < u > | < u >= − < ∇p > .

(9)

The form of nonlinear map K for general anisotropic 2D and 3D media has
been the subject of theoretical research for general anisotropic 2D and 3D media
[17,8,21,18,20,19]. Even if the model (9) for K is accepted, the data for coeﬃcient
β are not universally available and/or consistent.
Mathematical upscaling from micro- to mesoscale. There are essentially two
methodologies that apply. The ﬁrst, with the use of homogenization theory (H)
[22,1], requires periodic geometry but gives elegant theorems on convergence
of the averages of microscale quantities to the appropriate mesoscale quantities
when the size of periodic cell goes to 0. The second, volume averaging (VA), does
not restrict geometry and proposes that the averaged quantities are reasonably
stable if the averaging region (REV ≡ Representative Elementary Volume) is
large enough [19]. However, it may be diﬃcult to quantify what size of REV is
suﬃcient; see [23,24] for related work on elasticity and our forthcoming work.

Computational Models for Porescale

For the ﬂow in ΩF we consider two algorithms H and VA described below
which are useful in similar contexts as, respectively, the mathematical upscaling
methods H and VA. For other algorithms see [25,26].
We illustrate the algorithms with the following scenario. All ﬂow in Ω is
from left to right. The pore geometries are idealized: we envision rock grains
as very long cylinders so that every cross-section can be approximated by a 2D
computational region with ΩR being a union of solid disks replicated periodically.
The ratio of disk diameters to the size of the period denoted by D ranges from
0.6 to 0.9 in this study; see Fig. 1 and 3.

Algorithm H. This simple algorithm solves for (ω, ψ) in d = 2 and uses simple
structured grids over ΩF and therefore can be easily adapted to interpret data
from porescale imaging [5] without signiﬁcant investment of time in grid generation. It is based on a central ﬁnite diﬀerence formulation enhanced by treatment
of boundary conditions and post-processing, following [27,28,29].
The discretization of (3) and (4) yields
(μΔh − (u · ∇h )) ω = 0,

(10)

Δh ψ = −ω.

(11)

where the numerical Laplacian Δh has the usual 5-point stencil and the advective
term is computed using second order central diﬀerences. The coupling in the
model is resolved by iteration: given ω n , i) compute ψ n+1 from (11), then ii)
1
calculate velocity un+1 from ψ n+1 , then iii) solve (10) for ω n+ 2 , and ﬁnally iv)
1
compute ω n+1 = λω n+ 2 + (1 − λ)ω n where λ is the relaxation parameter.
In this algorithm steps i) and ii) require that boundary values of ψ and ω are
known, respectively. This is the most delicate part of the algorithm and crucial
for porescale computations: an idea how to implement inlet, outlet, and no-slip
conditions follows; we refer to [26,28,29] for details.
For structured rectangular grids over a periodic cell Ω, the boundary Γ is composed of vertical and horizontal segments only, and the external boundary has
either vertical or horizontal Γin , Γout . Consider vertical Γin . On inlet boundary,
u = (ux , 0) is given and hence ψ has to be constant and given as the integral
of ux while vorticity is given from (4). On the vertical portion of the outlet
∂ψ
boundary we have ∂ω
∂x = 0 and ∂x = 0.
In the interior, we have no-slip boundary conditions u = 0; it follows that
ψ ≡ const. To ﬁnd useful conditions for ω, we approximate its second derivative
2
δx2 ∂ ψ
as follows. Consider Taylor expansion ψ(x + δx, y) = ψ(x, y) + δx ∂ψ
∂x + 2 ∂x2 +
O(δx3 ). But uy = − ∂ψ
∂x = 0 thus −ω =

2(ψ(x+Δx,y)−ψ(x,y))

+ O(δx).

the computed averages and K and β are stable on all grids.

Fig. 3. Results of VA for D = 0.9 with Re = 1 (top) and Re = 100 (bottom).
Shown are contours of pressure p (left) and zoomed in velocity u proﬁles: component
x (middle) and y (right).

To recover (post-process for) the velocities and pressures, we use central ﬁnite
diﬀerences in the interior of the domain and appropriate one-sided diﬀerences at
the boundary. The pressure is found from (5).
As seen in Fig. 1, the algorithm works reasonably well for a range of Reynolds
numbers and grids that are not very ﬁne. The diﬃculties arise since ﬁnding an
optimal value of λ in step iv) may be a problem; see Fig. 2. The simplicity of H
is in that it consequently uses the same Poisson solver for which very eﬃcient
solvers and preconditioners [26,25] are available. As an alternative, a coupled
solver for (10)–(11) can be written but this requires sophisticated nonsymmetric

solvers and preconditioners. Overall, the algorithm H works well for small periodic domains Ω but may scale poorly to large regions, complex geometries, and
large Re.
Algorithm VA. This algorithm solves for (u, p) and can be used in complicated
geometries but requires substantial pre-processing; it follows an industry standard in computational ﬂuid dynamics [30,31]; general unstructured grids can be
used in 2D and 3D. We omit the details but provide an example which illustrates
the grids and complexity of computations, see Fig. 3.

Upscaling Algorithms from Porescale to Mesoscale

Strictly speaking, the work reported in this paper does not require any computations at mesoscale, i.e., in Ω. However, keeping in mind our future goals,
we choose to upscale from microscale to some chosen computational grid at
mesoscale. In this paper we choose the conservative cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerence
method equivalent to lowest order Mixed Finite Element method on rectangles
[32]; this provides a bridge to macroscale following [9,10].
The idea is as follows: we impose a mesoscale cell-centered grid over Ω in a
way which deﬁnes principal directions of ﬂow that we anticipate will prevail at
mesoscale (This may help to avoid handling full tensor K at mesoscale). With
each center of mesocale grid (Xj , Yj ), we have an associated cell Ωj over which we
average to get values Pj . Velocities are computed over unions of regions so that
they are associated with locations “dual” to those for pressures [32]; see Fig. 4
for illustration. Ideally, the locations (Xj , Yj ) coincide with centers of mass of
Ωj and the velocity components are computed in the direction of principal axis.
However, there are ways to handle situations when this does not hold.
Assume now that porescale results (u, p) are available. We then compute U
and P as discussed above. Next, by inverse modeling, we identify resistance of
the medium K−1 in the discrete counterpart of (8).

small oﬀ-diagonal components of K. Right: dependence of β on the relative diameter
D ∈ (0.7, 0.9) and on grid size (results computed for coarse and ﬁne grids).

Note that for small Re, the resistance K−1 reduces to K−1 as in (7). Thus, if
data is available for a large range of Re from creeping ﬂow to nonlinear laminar
regime, then one could hope to identify the appropriate model of tensor K. In
particular, if the medium is isotropic at mesoscale, then (9) is valid. In other
words, given K and K and knowing U, one can compute β for any Re. Clearly
if the model for K is valid and the computational algorithm is successful then
β remains reasonably constant throughout the nonlinear laminar regime; this
appears true in our results, see Fig. 5.
We stress that stability of K and β is not guaranteed with just any adhoc averaging technique; in particular, the choice of REV, principal axis and
their orientation, and of the boundary conditions, plays a signiﬁcant role. In
addition, there is currently no general explicit mathematical model and virtually
no experimental work for anisotropic inertia represented by K.

Discussion

Fluid ﬂow in porespace is subject to viscous eﬀects, inertia eﬀects, and dissipation
on the solid boundaries. In order to approximate the ﬂow accurately for large
Re, we need to ensure that the grid is ﬁne enough in the channels where the
solid boundaries are the closest to each other.
Using algorithm H we observed reasonable convergence for D ≤ 0.6. However, more work needs to be done before the algorithm H can scale to more
complicated geometries with D > 0.6 and for large Re. In particular, we are
considering a transient regularization of (3) which will help the convergence.
The use of algorithm VA was promising for realistic porosities i.e. D > 0.9.
However, VA requires care in gridding and monitoring convergence of the iterations. Here the diﬃculties are related to proper porescale grid deﬁnition with
respect to principal axis. There is also the relative lack of availability of VA due
to its commercial implementation.
Overall, regardless of the porescale algorithm chosen, for some grids and some
Re, the proﬁles of (u, p) may reveal local instabilities. However, this does not

necessarily lead to an instability of mesoscale properties at least with the averaging method that we proposed. In fact, K and β appear stable for a large range
of values of Re as well as appear convergent with respect to the grid size, see
Fig. 5. We note that both K and β are nonlinear quantities of interest in the
sense of [24]; see also [33] for recent related work on multiscale modeling.
Current and future work includes convergence analysis as well as serious computational studies aiding the theoretical modeling of tensor K. Our project is a
prototype of a computational laboratory which can provide on-demand model
data for ﬂow with inertia in porous media.
