Abstract. Maxwell’s equations are the foundation of electromagnetics,
its extensive applications make computational electromagnetics a new
rapidly growing subject. However, since the electric and the magnetic
ﬁelds are coupling in the Maxwell system, the numerical solution of the
full system of Maxwell’s equations is extremely expensive in terms of
computer time. Darwin model, which decouple the coupled system, is
such a good approximation to Maxwell’s equations. In three dimensional
space case, it neglects the transverse component of the displacement current; while in two dimensional space case, Darwin model is equivalent to
TE, TM models. For these reasons, it is worthwhile to investigate Darwin model, and a lot of works have been done to it. In this paper, we
review the advance in the Darwin model and introduce some of our new
results about the exterior problems of Darwin model and its numerical
solutions with inﬁnite elements methods.
Keywords: Maxwell’s equations, Darwin model, inﬁnite element method,
exterior problem.

Introduction

More and more modeling and simulation of electronic devices are related to the
computation of electromagnetics which becomes a very important branch in the
present computational science. However, since the multiphysics ﬁelds of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are coupling together in the Maxwell’s equations, there are
many challenges in dealing with the coupling system directly, and the numerical
solutions may be very expensive in terms of the computational cost. On the
other hand, for some problems, such as the simulations of charged particle beams
when no high frequency phenomenon or no rapid current charge occurs, Darwin
model, which appears as a correction of the quasi-electrostatic model, including
the electric ﬁelds generated by magnetic induction, is a good approximation
to Maxwell’s equations. This model is obtained by neglecting the solenoidal
part of the displacement current in the Maxwell’s equations, and exhibits an
elliptic character with inﬁnite propagation speed. Thus, the multiphysics ﬁelds

of electricity and magnetics are separated in several single physical ﬁeld systems
which are easy to solve.
It has been proved in 1992 by P.Degond and P.A.Raviart [1] that Darwin
model in three dimensional cases approximates Maxwell’s equations up to the
second order of the dimensionless parameter η = v¯/c for magnetic ﬁeld B and
to the third order of η for electric ﬁeld E, provided that η is small, where v¯
is characteristic velocity and c is light velocity. While in two dimension cases,
Darwin model is equivalent to TE, TM models without any approximation [15].
Some earlier investigations have been done by D.W.Hewett and C.W.Nielson
etc, please refer to [2,3,4] for a derivation of the Darwin model from the plasma
point and its numerical implementation by streamline methods in two dimensional bounded domains.
In 1995, P.Ciarlet and J.Zou [5] have studied the H(curl; Ω) and H(curl, div; Ω)
variational formulations for the Darwin model in three dimensional bounded domains, and proved the well-posedness of the variational systems.
Since quite a number of problems in applications are related to unbounded
domains, L.Ying and F.Li [6] in 2002 considered Darwin model of electric ﬁeld
with boundary value conditions in two dimensional exterior domains.
Recently, the Darwin model of magnetic ﬁeld has been considered by C.Liao
and L.Ying [7], the results are similar. An analysis of the Darwin model of approximation to Maxwell’s equations in 3-D unbounded domains was given in[16].
At the same time, three dimensional exterior problem of Darwin model of both
electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the numerical computation has been studied by
N.Fang and L.Ying [8].
The following contents are organized as: In Section 2 we recall the relationship
of Maxwell’s equations and Darwin model. While in Section 3 we review the work
in the foretime and introduce our recent results. And a short conclusion is given
in Section 4.

Maxwell’s Equations and Darwin Model

Maxwell’s equations in vacuum are of the following form in the space-time domain Ω × (0, T ), where Ω is an open simply connected domain Ω c in R3 with
Lipschitz-continuous boundary ∂Ω. (All the variables and function spaces in
bold are denoted by vector ones):

Where E = E(x, t), B = B(x, t) denote the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld
respectively, and ρ = ρ(x, t), J = J(x, t) are respectively the charge and current
densities satisfying

The positive constants c, ε0 , and μ0 are respectively the light velocity, the electric
permittivity, and the magnetic permeability in vacuum, which are related by
ε0 μ0 c2 = 1.
The relationship of Darwin model and Maxwell’s equations are discussed in [1]
when adding some initial conditions and assuming ∂Ω a perfect conductor. Since
the electric ﬁeld E can be decomposed into a sum of some transverse component
ET and some longitudinal component EL . Substituting the decomposition into
T
equation (1) and neglecting the term ∂ E
∂t , one can get
∇ × B = μ0 J +

Then the Maxwell’s equations (1) − (4) will be reduced to the following Darwin
model, see [1,14] for deduction details:

Where C(t) is an arbitrary function only depend on time t if Ω are bounded
domains. If Ω represents exterior domains, C(t) is a constant independent of
time t, for example C(t) = 1 if satisfying the boundary assumptions in [5].

∇ · B = 0, in Ω,

The coupling multiphysics ﬁelds of Maxwell’s equations are reduced to three
single physical ﬁeld systems. EL relies on problem (i), a simple Poisson equation.
B are solved by problem (ii), then plugging it into problem (iii), one can get ET .
All the mathematical challenges to Darwin model are how to solve the problems
(ii) and (iii).

Darwin Model and Its Numerical Methods

Both problem (ii) and problem (iii) contain equation ∇ · u = 0, i.e. (11) and
(15), and it is very diﬃcult to deal in numerical computations. All the numerical
studies of Darwin model to problems (ii) and (iii) in fact were carried on to this
point and gave their own ways to manage it.
D.W.Hewett and J.K.Boyd analyzed the solutions of Darwin model by streamline method in [3], and they discussed methods for calculating the magnetic ﬁeld
without formal vector decomposition and oﬀered a new procedure for ﬁnding the
inductive electric ﬁeld. As a consequence, the numerical eﬀorts required for each
of the ﬁeld time-steps are reduced, and more importantly, the needs to specify
several nonintuitive boundary conditions are eliminated.
In P.Degond and P.A.Raviart’s paper [1], they studied appropriate decompositions of vector ﬁelds which give rise to the well-posedness of the Darwin model.
Besides, they obtained a by-product, that is the uniqueness of the variational
formulations of the elliptic boundary value problem of Darwin model.
Later works are processed to tackle Darwin model through mixed variational
methods by using Babuska and Brezzi’s saddle point theory [12], which is said:
Let X and Q be two Hilbert spaces with norms · X and · Q respectively,
a(·, ·) and b(·, ·) be two continuous bilinear forms defined respectively on X × X
and X × Q, and f (·) and g(·) be two continuous linear forms defined respectively
on X and Q. Then the problem : Find (u, p) ∈ (X, Q) such that
a(u, v) + b(v, p) = f (v), ∀ v ∈ X,
b(u, q) = g(q), ∀ q ∈ Q

(18)

is called a saddle point problem. Let V be a closed subspace of X defined as
V = {v ∈ X; b(v, q) = 0, ∀ q ∈ Q}.
Assume that there exist two positive constants α and β such that

and

a(v, v) ≥ α v

∀ v ∈ V,

(V-ellipticity)

(19)

b(v, q)
sup
≥β q
v∈X v X

Q,

∀ q ∈ Q.

(inf-sup condition)

(20)

Then there exists a unique solution to the saddle point problem (18).
So the key point turns to investigate the mixed variational formulations of
the Darwin model and to verify the V-ellipticity and the inf-sup condition.
The details to discuss the variational formulations of Darwin model were
given by P.Ciarlet,JR and J.Zou in [5]. They have studied the H(curl; Ω) and
H(curl, div; Ω) variational formulations for Darwin model in three dimensions,
and proved the well-posedness. Nedelec’s ﬁnite element method is used to solve
the H(curl; Ω) variational formulation where ∇ · u = 0 is naturally satisﬁed in
such ﬁnite element method. Moreover, they discussed a standard ﬁnite element

Darwin Approximation to Maxwell’s Equations

779

method of so called Hood-Taylor ﬁnite element [12] for the H(curl, div; Ω) variational formulation. Convergence and the error estimates were obtained without
requiring the physical domains to be convex. They did not give numerical experiments.
Since quite a number of problems in applications are related to exterior domains, L.Ying and F.Li in 2002 considered the exterior problem of Darwin model
in [6]. They ﬁrst considered Darwin model of electric ﬁeld with boundary value
conditions in two dimensional exterior domains. In order to show the coercivity
in weighted space W whose elements belong to H(curl, div; Ω) in ﬁnite domain
while in the inﬁnity distance belong to weighted space H1,∗ (Ω) (see [9] for a
deﬁnition), they spent a lot of energy and at last made clear that
u

∗

={ ∇×u

2

+ ∇ · u 20 + < u · n, 1 >2∂Ω } 2

is only a semi-norm on W. With analytic function theory, they got a null space
V0 of two degrees of freedom. Then they were able to establish the variational
formulation and proved its well-posedness in the quotient space W/V0 . Numerical examples by inﬁnite element methods were given as well, and P2 − P0
elements and square exterior domain with triangle meshes were chosen to implement the calculations. They got a so-called transfer matrix [10] in virtue of
Stoke’s equations since the solution of Darwin model was just that of Stoke’s
equation with appropriate boundary value and inhomogeneous terms. Numerical
results illustrated three-order convergence under L2 -norm and one-order convergence under · ∗ norm, which was quite good in accordance with the theoretical
error estimate results.
Later on, the magnetic ﬁeld of Darwin model has been considered by C.Liao
and L.Ying [7]. The results are similar, and the diﬀerence is that there are
three degrees of freedom in the null space because the boundary conditions are
diﬀerent. Although diﬀering from a function in V0 , they manage to prove the
uniqueness of the solutions if imposing a boundary condition at the inﬁnity
u||x|→∞ = 0 for Darwin model. This was once left as an open problem in [6].
Meanwhile, the three dimensional exterior problem of Darwin model and its
numerical computation has been studied by N.Fang and L.Ying [8]. Quite different from the two dimensional exterior domains cases, · ∗ is just a norm in
three dimensional case, such fact was proved through potential theory. So the
well-posedness of the variational formulations were able to proved directly in
W. Moreover, for the need of investigating the Darwin model, they proved an
important decomposition that any function in exterior domain Ω belonging to
L2 (Ω) can be decomposed to the sum of a gradient function and a rotational
function, i.e. For any f ∈ L2 (Ω), it has the decomposition f = ∇φ + ∇ × u,
where φ ∈ Hc = {φ ∈ H 1,∗ (Ω); ∇φ × n = 0}, u ∈ B0 (see [8] for the deﬁnitions). Numerical experiments with inﬁnite element method are carried on for
axisymmetric ﬁelds. The diﬃculty is that the variational formulation has to be
considered in some weighted Sobolev spaces, the results show the convergence
once again.

Fig. 1. Sketch maps of ﬁrst layer grids in two spacial dimensions and three dimensional
axisymmetric space cases

The inﬁnite element method, which is suitable particularly for unbounded
domain problems and singular problems, has its complete academic foundations
and wide applications [10]. One great character of the inﬁnite element method
distinguished it with other methods is to design a similar triangulation with
inﬁnite grids for the question domain. The similar triangulation, which divides
the interested domain into layers one by one with a proportionality, is the same
as that of classical ﬁnite element methods in each layer. The outstanding point
is that the inﬁnite element method can approximate an exterior problem to the
inﬁnite or a singular problem to the singular position. Of course, it will get a
discrete system with inﬁnite algebraic equations. However, because in each layer
the stiﬀness matrices are similar in a proportion, there exists a real transfer
matrix which can transfer the values from one layer to the other layers. Thus,
the whole computational workload for the inﬁnite element method is reduced to
solve a classical ﬁnite element in the ﬁrst layer and to ﬁnd the transfer matrix.
For many exterior or singular problems, such as elliptic problems and singular
problems, it is economical and eﬃcient to use the inﬁnite element method to
ﬁnd the solutions.
The following are parts of the numerical results of Darwin model in two spacial
dimensions [6,7] and three dimensional axisymmetric space cases with inﬁnite
element methods [8]. Fig.1 are sketch maps of the ﬁrst layer grids of the inﬁnite
element triangulations in two spacial dimension and three dimensional axisymmetric domains.

under corresponding norms which obeys the theoretical results.

Darwin Approximation to Maxwell’s Equations

783

Table 3 and Table 4 show that about ﬁrst order convergence under the norms
· † for both the magnetic and the electric ﬁeld are obtained. Table 5 lists
the errors in the domain S2 = {x; 1 ≤ |r|, |z| ≤ 32}, and the error tends a
level when ξ decrease. Here ξ is the proportionality constant of inﬁnite element
triangulation, and m is the numbers of layers been calculated.
Example 4. (Tested by N.Fang [8]) Comparisons of local quantities of interest
are made in Table 6 for the axisymmetric electric ﬁeld case. Axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld and two dimensional space cases are similar [6,7,8]. The numerical
experiments illustrate that one can ﬁnd “good” solutions by reﬁning the meshes
and decrease the proportion ξ at the same time.

Conclusions

It gives at least a way to deal with some multiphysics models by decomposing
the coupling system. Darwin model is such a successful example which approximates Maxwell’s equations well enough. Hereto, Darwin models are thoroughly
studied both in bounded domains and exterior domains especially by variational
methods. Our investigations in establishing the general theory are mostly about
the exterior problems. Suitable tools like analytic functions theory, potential
theory and weighted Sobolev spaces are utilized to ﬁnish the theoretical analysis. Besides, inﬁnite element methods are eﬀective to simulate the models in
unbounded domains, this was veriﬁed by the numerical experiments. Of course,
as an approximate model to Maxwell’s equations, Darwin model are worthy of
further study. It leaves to combine the problems of (i), (ii) and (iii) together.
Some related works such as adaptive ﬁnite elements to Darwin model are being
studied by the authors.
