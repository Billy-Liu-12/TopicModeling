Abstract. Mechanism of photoswitching in diarylethenes involves the lightinitiated symmetry-allowed disrotatory electrocyclic reaction. Here we propose
a computationally inexpensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) based method
that is able to produce accurate potential surfaces for the excited states. The
method includes constrained optimization of the geometry for the ground and
two excited singlet states along the ring-closing reaction coordinate using the
Slater Transition State method, followed by single-point energy evaluation. The
ground state energy is calculated with the broken-symmetry unrestricted
Kohn-Sham formalism (UDFT). The first excited state energy is obtained by
adding the UDFT ground state energy to the excitation energy of the pure
singlet obtained in the linear response Time-Dependent (TD) DFT restricted
Kohn-Sham formalism. The excitation energy of the double excited state is calculated using a recently proposed (Mikhailov, I. A.; Tafur, S.; Masunov, A. E.
Phys. Rev. A 77, 012510, 2008) a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff approximation to
the second order response TD-DFT.

1 Introduction
Recording density of the data storage becomes an important issue in the recent years.
While magnetic media neared its maximum capacity with the bit size c.a. 20 nm, the
technological advances in optical disks is expected to win the competition with traditional magnetic storage devices. In particular, these advances include the photon-mode
recording, in the contrast to the optical memory systems presently available on the
market. Most of the existing systems utilize heat-mode recording, where the light is
converted into thermal energy, induces a magnetic or structural phase transition (magneto-optical [1, 2] and phase-change [3] effects) and changes physical properties of the
medium. In the photon-mode of data recording, the light initiates photochemical
reaction of a particular component of the material. This allows introducing the third
axial dimension to the recording process. This three-dimensional technology will use

polymers, doped with the photochromic compounds undergoing a reversible photoisomerization [4]. A promising class of photochromics is exemplified by diarylethene
compounds, shown in Scheme 1. They undergo photoinduced conrotatory ring opening
and closing, and have important practical advantages over other classes of compounds,
including thermal stability and resistance to linear optical photofatigue [5].

Some of the photochromic materials undergo photoisomerization in ultrafast regime (in the order of 10 fs). These ultrafast switching capabilities can be useful for
various photonic devices, such as optical switches, variable frequency filters, attenuators, and phase shifters, interconnection, and components of optical computers.
Organic photonic materials have another important advantage, as their properties
can be fine-tuned by chemical modifications of molecules. However, these modifications may change or completely eliminate the photochromic ability. Theoretical studies are indispensible to understand the reason of these changes and to formulate the
guiding principles for the rational molecular design ([6] and [7]). However, as Nakamura et al. state in their recent review [7], the accurate relative energies of the excited
states in real size molecules are still very difficult to calculate, because it requires the
balanced description for both covalent (2A state) and ionic states (1B state).
In this contribution we propose a new theoretical method based on the Density
Functional Theory. This method is able to produce accurate potential surfaces for the
1B and 2A excited states as compared to available experimental data and results of
the high-level multireference wavefunction theory methods. It is also computationally
inexpensive and capable to predict the photophysics of large molecules of practical
interest.

2 Theory
Computational photochemistry offers a number of theoretical methods for investigation
of photochemical reaction mechanisms. Unlike thermally activated chemical reactions,
which take place in the ground electronic state (S0), a photochemical process involves
the electronically excited state (S1). During this process the reactive system is electronically excited from S0 to S1, and after some evolution on an upper potential energy
surface (PES) decays back to the ground state in either product or reactant basin
through conical intersections (CIX). A useful simplified description of this process is
called the reaction Pathway Approach [8]. Instead of the entire PES, it considers the
minimum energy path (MEP) [9] which is followed by the center of a wave packet
[10]. This approach is focused on local properties of PES, such as minima, barriers,
and slopes. In the Pathway Approach, a Conical Intersection serves as a funnel, which

Theoretical Photochemistry of the Photochromic Molecules

delivers the excited state intermediate to the ground state reactant or the product, so
that quantum yield is largely determined there [11]. It has been found very useful for a
qualitative analysis of reaction mechanisms, prediction of photoproducts, and rationalization of experimental excited state lifetimes, quantum yields, absorption and emission
spectra [12, 13].
A number of computational tools have been developed to predict the PES
[11, 14, 15]. A computationally inexpensive approach to describe electronically excited systems is based on the time-dependent (TD) or, more precisely, linear response
DFT formalism. Instead of orbital relaxation, TD-DFT uses a mathematically equivalent procedure where the KS wavefunction is expanded in terms of Slater determinants, singly excited with respect to the reference state. The rigorous formulation of
TD-DFT [16] demonstrates that this description is in principle exact, given that the
frequency-dependent exchange-correlation functional is known. In most practical
applications, however, this frequency dependence is ignored (so called adiabatic
TD-DFT). This method was often reported to accurately predict electronic spectra and
excited state geometries. However, TD-DFT was found to be somewhat less successful in description of PESs in the vicinity of a CIX [17]. In this contribution we show
that these difficulties are routed to the failure of the restricted Kohn-Sham formalism
for the reference ground state close to geometry of the pericyclic minimum, and introduce a possible solution.
The Kohn-Sham formalism of DFT was developed for non-degenerate cases; it
breaks down for systems with strong diradical character and degeneracy of the electronic levels, such as CIX geometries. However, static (also known as left-right) electron correlation can be taken into account by using different orbitals for different spin.
This approach, known as the unrestricted Kohn-Sham formalism (UKS) is known to
yield a qualitatively correct description of bond breaking [18].
Excited states, on the other hand, require the restricted formalism to avoid heavy
mixing of higher spin states in description of the excited singlet. Although the TDDFT was suggested on the UKS reference [19], this is considered to be incorrect in a
rigorous theory [20]. One possible approach for analyzing PES of excited states can
be formulated by adding excitation energies obtained in the restricted TD-DFT formalism to the ground state energies calculated with the UKS method. Thereafter we
will refer to this approach as to RTD-UDFT. Although for the photoswitching systems considered in this contribution the difference in the ground state energy obtained
with the RKS and UKS formalisms is close to 20 kcal/mol or less, we will numerically show that this difference is sufficient to bring the excited state PESs to agreement with the results obtained at a higher theory level, when available.
Another theoretical development, necessary to describe the region of the conical intersection is related to the double excited states, missing in the adiabatic linear response TD-DFT approximation [21]. Mixing of the double excited states to the linear
response TD-DFT states is offered by the Coupled Electronic Oscillator formalism
[22-24], where doubly excited states appear in the second order as simple products of
the excitations obtained at the linear response level. We recently used this fact to propose the a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff approximation (ATDA), and demonstrated its
accuracy for linear polyenes in their ground state geometry [25]. We will show in
Section 5, that ATDA-UDFT produces accurate energies for the double excited state in
the entire range of the bond breaking reaction coordinate, provided that the molecular

172

I.A. Mikhailov and A.E. Masunov

geometry corresponds to that state. For excited states that appear in the linear response
TD-DFT the ATDA yields identical excitation energies and transition dipoles from the
ground state, while permanent dipoles and state-to-state transition dipoles differ.
Since analytical gradients in the ATDA-UDFT approach are not yet implemented
in computer codes, in our studies we use the Slater transition state method (STS) to
optimize geometry of the excited states. In this method, half an electron is promoted
from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and self-consistency is achieved with these fractional orbital occupations [26].
STS is known to be a good approximation to the corresponding ΔSCF excitation energy [27, 28]. Its further extension to the modified linear response DFT method [29]
yields considerable improvement in description of the charge-transfer and Rydberg
states, compared to the TD-DFT approach. A practical advantage of STS is an easier
SCF convergence, compared to the excited-state SCF convergence, which often presents a major problem [30].

3 Computational Details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 2003 Rev. E1 suite of programs [31].
We used the hybrid meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional M05-2X from
Truhlar’s group with double fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange, designed for
accurate description of both equilibrium geometries and transition states. The minimum energy pathways (MEPs) were built using the relaxed scan along the forming
pericyclic C–C bond (reaction coordinate). The ground singlet state (S0), was optimized at the UM05-2X/6-31G level of theory, while the single 1B and double 2A
excited singlet state geometries were optimized in the Slater Transition State method.
STS was implemented using equal fractional occupation numbers for HOMO and
LUMO in the alpha-set only [to approximate geometry of the single excited state 1B,
IOp(5/75=1,76=2)], and both alpha and beta sets [to approximate geometry of the
double excited state 2A, IOp(5/75=1, 76=2,77=1,78=2)]. Excitation energies were
taken from single-point calculations in the a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff approximation
for the lowest single excited state 1B and the lowest double excited state 2A. The
excitation energies thus obtained at the ATDA-M05-2X/6-31 level, were added to the
ground state energies obtained at the UM05-2X/6-31G level of theory. The resulting
ATDA-UM05-2X/6-31G//STS-UM05-2X/6-31G energies were plotted in the range of
the reaction coordinate from 1.4 to 3.5A with 0.1A step size as MEPs.

4 Results and Discussion
Cyclohexadiene/hexatriene (CHD/HT) conversion is the simplest example of an electrocyclic reaction. Dynamics of cycloreversion in the CHD/HT system was repeatedly
studied with time-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy techniques [12, 32]. The results are
summarized in Ref. [10].
The theoretical description of this process involves plotting realistic potential energy surfaces (PESs), which until recently required the use of ab initio multireferencebased quantum chemistry methods. Pioneering CAS study of the HT/CHD system

Theoretical Photochemistry of the Photochromic Molecules

173

was published by Robb, Olivucci et al. [33-35]. They found that 2A and 1A surfaces
touch at a molecular conformation of tetraradical character, located away from the C2symmetric coordinate, and including partial bonds C1…C6 and C2…C6. They also
found that accounting for dynamic electron correlation is essential to correctly predict
the relative energies of 1B and 2A states. Despite the fact that 2A/1A and 1B/2A
conical intersections complicate the energy landscape by adding an extra dimension,
the qualitative interpretation given by the state correlation diagram along symmetric
coordinate still holds. It was further confirmed at the high level (CASPT2 and MRCI)
by building ab initio PESs and performing two-dimensional quantum dynamics
[36, 37] on these PESs. Barrierless descent on excited state PES was found to determine ultrafast photoconversion between CHD and HT, and quantum yield of this
process was primarily determined by location of the 2A/1A CIX.

system, predicted at the ATDA-UDFT/6-31G//STS-DFT/6-31G theory level, using the M05-2X
exchange-correlation functional. Absence of an appreciable energy barrier on the pathway from
the 1B state of CHD in the Franck-Condon geometry (left) to the minimum on the 2A surface is
consistent with ultrafast rate of the photoinitiated cycloreversion reaction CHD→HT.

Minimum energy pathways (MEPs) obtained in this study are plotted in Fig. 1. As
the C1…C6 reaction coordinate contracts from a non-bonding distance to the normal
covalent bond, the bright 1B state (characterized by the large transition dipole from
the ground sate), is being monotonically stabilized in energy, starting descent to the
pericyclic minimum. At the same time, the dark 2A state (with a negligibly small

174

transition dipole from the ground state) is being stabilized even faster, crosses the 1B
state surface, and forms the bottom of the pericyclic minimum.
It is worth noting that geometry of the ground state does not approximate the excited state geometry accurately enough to produce a reasonable potential energy surface. The vertical excitation curve, plotted in Fig. 1 and representing energy of the 1B
state at the ground state geometry, displays a maximum instead of a pericyclic minimum, and contradicts both high level ab initio and more accurate relaxed ATDAUDFT data.

from Ref. [36] are shown for comparison in parentheses. Absence of an appreciable energy
barrier on the pathway from the 1B state of CHD in the Franck-Condon geometry (left) to the

CHD→HT.

A qualitative comparison between our modified DFT results and state-of-the-art
wavefunction theory method MR-PT2 calculations of the CHD/HT system is presented in Fig. 2. Five important points were considered: ground state equilibrium
geometries for closed and open isomers (CHD and HT), corresponding to
Frank-Condon geometries of the ground states; and excited states 1B and 2A, optimized into the respective pericyclic minima. They are in surprisingly good agreement
with high level ab initio results. As one can see, ATDA-UDFT //STS-DFT at the
M05-2X/6-31G theory level, adopted in this work, almost uniformly overstabilizes

both excited states by 0.4-1.0 eV, but retains the correct order of excited states, as
compared to the multireference perturbation theory results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the correct state ordering in this system, obtained from
a DFT-based approach.

Fig. 3. Minimum energy pathways for the ground (S0, 1A), single excited (S1, 1B) and double
excited states (S2, 2A) along the reaction pathway of ring-closing C–C bond in the dithioarylethene system, predicted at the ATDA-UDFT/6-31G//STS-DFT/6-31G theory level, using the
M05-2X exchange-correlation functional. The legend is the same as in Fig. 1. Absence of an
appreciable energy barrier on the pathway from the 1B state of the open form in the FranckCondon geometry (left) to the minimum on the 2A surface is consistent with ultrafast rate of the
photoinitiated cycloreversion reaction. The distance C1-C6 (reaction coordinate) was kept
frozen during geometry optimizations of the ground and excited states using the STS-DFT
method.

Dithienylethene (Scheme 1, with X=S) is the simplest homolog of diarilethens, an
important class of compounds for photoswitching applications. Our calculations produced the minimum energy pathways for the ground and the two lowest single and
double excited states, which are plotted in Fig. 3. One can see that MEP of the 1B state
has a minimum in the closed form, and monotonically rises to the Franck-Condon
region of the open form. The doubly excited 2A state, on the other hand, forms a
pericyclic minimum and crosses below the 1B state in the vicinity of the conical
intersection.
Therefore, the excitation of the open form is followed by the ultrafast barrierless
relaxation into pericyclic minimum along 1B and then 2A PES, while the excitation

176

I.A. Mikhailov and A.E. Masunov

of the closed form will populate the potential minimum on the excited state surface.
The conversion of the excited closed form into the pericyclic minimum must first
overcome the small (c.a. 5 kcal/mol) potential energy barrier, which leads to relatively
slow cycloreversion. The excited state absorption will then bring the system from the
1B to the 2A state, followed by barrierless relaxation toward CIX. Thus, our MEPs
explain both slow cycloreversion and ultrafast photoswitching upon sequential twophoton absorption.

5 Conclusions
A new approach to plot potential energy surfaces of the excited states, based on Density Functional Theory is presented. This approach includes both single and double
excitations appearing in first and second order Time-Dependent DFT in the Coupled
Electronic Oscillator formalism (dubbed the a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff approximation, ATDA-DFT). Unphysical spikes on these surfaces close to pericyclic minima
were traced to the failure of the restricted Kohn-Sham formalism to describe the partial bond breaking on the ground states, and were eliminated by replacing the ground
state energy component of the excited state with the one obtained in the unrestricted
broken symmetry Kohn-Sham formalism (termed here ATDA-UDFT). Importance of
excited state geometry optimization (as opposed to the habitual use of unrelaxed
ground state geometries) in accurate prediction of these potential energy surfaces was
demonstrated. For the lack of analytical derivatives at the ATDA-UDFT theory level
the lowest single and double excited state geometry is approximated using the Slater
Transition State method (STS-DFT). The combined ATDA-UDFT//STS-DFT approach was shown to slightly underestimate energy of both excited states but correctly
reproduce the state ordering and the energy crossovers as compared to the high-level
multireference perturbation theory results for hexatriene/cyclohexadiene system. The
approach was also able to explain experimentally observed slow photochemical
cycloreversion rates and fast excited state absorption initiated cycloreversion in model
dithioarylethenes. This method may assist in future development of new photoswitching materials for advanced applications in the Information Technology.
