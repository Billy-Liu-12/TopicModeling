Abstract. In physics and ﬂuid mechanics, the boundary layer is the
ﬂuid layer in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface. It is important in many aerodynamic problems. This work presents a numerical
simulation of the bidimensional laminar boundary-layer problem considering a steady incompressible ﬂow with no-slip condition on the surface
by Autonomous Leaves Graph based on ﬁnite volume discretizations. In
addition, a Modiﬁed Hilbert Curve numbers the control volumes. Initially, the numerical solution of the ﬂat-plate problem is compared to its
analytical solution, namely Blasius Solution. Secondly, simulations of the
ﬂow along a NACA airfoil shape are presented. Computer experiments
show that an adaptive mesh reﬁnement using the Autonomous Leaves
Graph with the Modiﬁed Hilbert Curve numbering is appropriate for
a aerodynamic problem. Finally, results illustrate that the method provides a good trade-oﬀ between speed and accuracy.
Keywords: Finite Volume Method, Adaptive mesh reﬁnement, Boundary Layer Problem, NACA airfoils, Space-ﬁlling curves, Hilbert Curve.

Introduction

Numerical solution of partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) may require the use
of a mesh reﬁnement strategy that concentrates more mesh points where the
solution and/or its derivatives rapidly change. The Autonomous Leaves Graph
(ALG) was proposed for the Finite Volume Method and a space-ﬁlling curve
named Modiﬁed Hilbert Curve (MHC) was proposed in order to number the
mesh control volumes [1]. ALG children nodes become autonomous as their parent node is deleted. Neighboring control-volume nodes which were generated
from diﬀerent parent volume nodes can be directly linked whether they have
the same reﬁnement level. On the other hand, they are indirectly linked through
transition nodes in case they have diﬀerent reﬁnement levels. All modiﬁcations in
the graph are merely local. In addition, an algorithm based on the Hilbert Curve
construction is used in order to implement the numbering of the control-volume
nodes.
Thus, this work presents a Finite Volume solution of the boundary layer problem using the ALG scheme. Boundary layers have been of great importance in

the study of viscous ﬂuid ﬂow. In 1904, Ludwig Prandtl made the biggest breakthrough by demonstrating the existence of a thin boundary layer in ﬂuid ﬂow.
Moreover, he found that there exists a thin layer near an object surface, where
the viscous aerodynamic forces are as important as the inertial forces [2].
After this brief introduction, section 2 describes the Boundary Layer Problem.
Next, section 3 shows the numerical method. Afterwards, section 4 shows the
experimental results. Finally, section 5 draws some considerations.

Boundary Layer Problem

Let = Δ
L , where Δ is the velocity boundary-layer thickness and L is the reference length used in the Reynolds number [3]. Using a magnitude analysis order,
no term in the y-momentum equation is larger than in the estimated magnitude and the well-known governing Navier-Stokes equations of viscous ﬂuid ﬂow
can be greatly simpliﬁed within the boundary layer. Notably, the PDE characteristic becomes parabolic, rather than the elliptical form of the full NavierStokes equations. This greatly simpliﬁes the solution of the equations. Thus, the
Navier-Stokes equations for a bidimensional steady incompressible ﬂow in Cartesian coordinates are given by the momentum and the continuity equations, i.e.
the nonlinear governing PDEs in terms of dimensional variables are given by [3]

The Finite Volume discretization of the momentum equation was divided in
two parts: the discretization of the ﬂat-plate Boundary Layer Problem and the
Boundary Layer Problem with a NACA airfoil in the domain.

Assuming that the ﬂow in the middle of the control volume edge represents the
average of its variation in the edge [5], (7) can be rewritten as

given in (1) and (4), respectively. Fig. 2 depicts the discretization scheme adopted
where the circles represent the control volumes of the Finite Volume mesh.

Tests were performed with air kinematic viscosity ν = 1.5 · 10−5 ms . Reﬁnement
decisions are performed in both 2D directions verifying the diﬀerence of the
absolute value between two control volumes.

the plate can be represented by a single curve with the proper dimensionless.
For the solution of this constant property, the ﬂat-plate ﬂow is known as the
Blasius Solution, which shows that for a ﬂow with Reynolds number (Re) much
larger than unity, i.e. Re > >1, the velocity proﬁles have the same dimensionless
shape in the Boundary Layer region. More precisely, a dimensionless similarity
variable in the normal direction is given by [7]

(13)

where x, y are the distances from the ﬂat-plate leading edge, u∞ is the air velocity
in the free-stream region, and ν is the air kinematic viscosity.
Subsequently, the parallel velocity to the plate is dimensionless by the edge
velocity u∞ , which is the free-stream velocity for this particular case. Thus, the

A Numerical Simulation. Tests of the ﬂat-plate Boundary Layer Problem
were performed with u∞ = 200, u∞ = 10 and a limit of eight reﬁnement levels
for each control volume. Initially, Blasius solutions are depicted in Fig. 4.

One example of the tests performed is depicted in Fig. 5 comprising of x =
[0; 1], y = [0; 0.1] and u∞ = 200. Fig. 5 shows the Modiﬁed Hilbert Curve for
numbering the mesh control volumes. Besides, Fig. 5 shows the Boundary Layer
in the bottom of the domain.

where n is the number of control volumes.
Tests comparing the adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) and the non-AMR
solutions were performed. Exemplifying, the non-AMR used 340 control volumes
whereas the test with the AMR, presented in Fig. 5, used 164 control volumes,
which makes up 42.2% less control volumes in relation to the non-AMR test.
Along the same lines, the AMR scheme spent 234 milliseconds whereas the nonAMR scheme spent 469 milliseconds. Considering the numerical average error
between the simulation and Blasius solution, it is 5.62 · 10−4 in such test.
Figure 6 depicts a test performed with x=[0;1], y=[0; 0.01] and u∞ = 10
in order to show that the results correspond to the Blasius Solution. In this
test, 340 control volumes were generated for the non-AMR scheme whereas the
test performed to the AMR scheme generated 169 control volumes, which is
49.7% less of the total amount of control volumes in the non-AMR scheme.
In addition, the AMR scheme spent 813 milliseconds whereas the non-AMR
scheme spent 1282 milliseconds. In this test, a numerical average error between
the numerical approximation and the Blasius Solution is 8.31 · 10−3 . Table 4.1
summarizes those results. Moreover, Table 1 presents a comparison of the number
of control volumes and time between the adaptive and the non-adaptive schemes
(processing time in milliseconds).

Boundary Layer Numerical Simulation with a NACA Airfoil in
the Domain

A NACA0012 airfoil is presented in the domain with 35o of angle of attack. This
test was performed with u∞ = 250 and u∞ = 350. Figure 7 shows a Boundary
Layer numerical simulation with a NACA0012 in the domain and a limit of six
reﬁnement levels for each control volume. Figure 8 represents the vector ﬁeld of
the ﬂux of a test. Figure 9 shows a test making up 7474 control volumes. This
test was performed with u∞ = 350 and a limit of 10 reﬁnement levels for each
control volume.

Consideration Remarks

This work presents a numerical simulation of the Boundary Layer Problem by
ALG based on the Finite Volume Method. The ﬂat-plate Boundary Layer numerical simulation is compared to the Blasius Solution. A NACA0012 airfoil
is numerically simulated showing that ALG and MHC (this for numbering the
control volumes) are adequate to simulate a complex problem such as in aerodynamics. In future works, ALG based on triangular control volumes should be
investigated.
