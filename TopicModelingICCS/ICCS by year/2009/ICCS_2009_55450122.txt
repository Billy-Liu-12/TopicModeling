Abstract. We have performed ab initio Monte Carlo simulated annealing simulations and density functional theory calculations to study the
structures and stabilities of copper oxide clusters, Cun On (n=1-4). We
determined the lowest energy structures of neutral, positive and negatively charged copper oxide clusters using the B3LYP/LANL2DZ model
chemistry. The geometries are found to undergo a structural change from
two- to three-dimensions when n = 4 in the neutral clusters. We have
investigated the size dependence of selected electronic properties of the
binding energies, second diﬀerences of the energy, ionization potentials,
electron aﬃnities, and HOMO-LUMO gaps. We also have investigated
fragmentation channels and charge distributions.
Keywords: Densitiy functional theory, copper oxide clusters.

Introduction

Studies of clusters help understand the evolution of properties from isolated
atoms to bulk matter as well as to probe the details of solvation. Recently, it has
been found that metal oxide clusters contribute to health hazards [1,2,3,4]. The
high speed collision of clusters with solid surfaces can give rise to short-lived
species at extreme temperature and pressures. It has been shown that these
impact-heated clusters provide an environment in which chemical reactions can
be induced. Energetic cluster impact also has the potential for technological
application in the formation of particularly dense and coherent metal and semiconductor thin ﬁlms. Metal oxide clusters formed during combustion react with
many organic compounds. [5, 6] The practical uses of metal clusters are well
known and include catalysis, nanomaterials, and composite materials.
Experimental [7,8,9,10] and computational [11,12,13,14] studies exist for some
small copper oxide clusters (1-2 copper atoms.) Three isomers have been suggested as possible structures for CuO2 [15]: bent CuOO (bent, Cs ), linear OCuO,
and C2v OCuO. Evidence has been found both the bent CuOO [16,17,18,19] and
the linear OCuO [15, 20, 21]. Vibrational frequencies have been calculated [20]
−
for CuO3 , OCuO−
2 , and Cu(O3 ) . Recently, the structures of CuO4 , CuO5 [22]
and neutral and negatively charged CuO6 [23] were determined using plane-wave
density functional theory. In addition, Cu2 Ox (x=1-4) have been studied using

anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations [24, 25]. In
this paper, we investigate the electronic and geometric structures of neutral and
charged copper oxide clusters ((CuO)n n=1-4).

Method of Calculation
Ab Initio Monte Carlo Simulation

The study of atomic and molecular clusters is hindered by the existence of multiple isomers for a given size cluster. Without an a priori knowledge of the global
energy minima, the use of computer simulation methods, such as simulated annealing, often allow the location of global minima. For this reason, we performed
ab initio simulated annealing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations (using Gaussian 03
and homegrown scripts) [26] to locate stable geometric structures for these clusters. The simulations used multiple starting geometries for each cluster size. The
temperature was decreased from 2000 K to 300 K over a period of up to 500 MC
steps. We used the B3LYP (Becke’s 3-parameter exchange functional with LeeYang-Parr correlation energy functional) [27, 28, 29] version of DFT to calculate
the energy.
2.2

Basis Sets

We evaluated several basis sets as candidates for our studies. These were
6-31G** [30, 31, 32], 6-31++G** [33, 30, 34, 35, 36, 37], 6-311G** [36, 38, 39, 40],
6-311++G** [35, 41], LANL2DZ [42, 43, 44], and DGDZVP [45, 46]. MC simulations were followed by standard geometry optimization using [47]. Calculations found the lowest energy clusters for Cu2 On (n = 1 − 4) shown in Fig. 1.
For Cu2 O3 and Cu2 O4 , diﬀerent isomers were found depending on basis set
(Cu2 O3 -a: 6-31G**; Cu2 O3 -b: 6-31++G**, 6-311G**, 6-311++G**, LANL2DZ
and DGDZVP; Cu2 O4 -a: 6-31++G**, 6-311++G**, LANL2DZ and DGDZVP;
Cu2 O4 -b: 6-31G** and 6-311G** .) Experimental data of electron aﬃnities of
Cu2 O to Cu2 O4 clusters is available [48]. A comparison of calculated and measured electron aﬃnities are shown in Table 1. The best agreement with experimental data is found with the LANL2DZ basis set, which is therefore used in
the remainder of this work.

Results and Discussion
Geometric Structure

The optimized structures of neutral, positive and negatively charged (CuO)n
clusters with n=1-4 are shown in Fig. 2. The low-lying spin states (i.e., singlet,
doublet, triplet, and quartet) of a given cluster were considered in the calculations. Every neutral copper oxide cluster, (CuO)n , can be made from Cun−1 On−1
cluster by attaching a Cu-O molecule to the side of Cun−1 On−1 cluster.
In CuO, the Cu-O distances are 1.76˚
A(cation), 1.76˚
A(neutral) and
˚
1.74A(anion). Our calculated value of neutral Cu-O distance is in good agreement experimental value of 1.73 ˚

are doublet, singlet and singlet for the neutral, cation and anion clusters, respectively. The structure of the lowest energy Cu2 O2 cluster is rhombus in our
simulations and calculations. The spin states of optimized structures are singlet,
doublet, and doublet for the neutral, cation and anion clusters, respectively.
Wang et al. [24] and Dai et al. [25] have suggested minimum energy structures
for Cu2 O2 . Wang, et. al., suggest the structure is a rhombus while Dai, et. al,
suggest the structure is linear or near linear. The Cu-O bond length of Cu2 O2
structure found by Wang et al. is 1.78˚
A and the angle of Cu-O-Cu of Cu2 O2
structure is 80 . Our Cu-O bond lengths are 2.01˚
A(cation), 1.86˚
A(neutral) and
˚
1.92A(anion) and average angle Cu-O-Cu of Cu2 O2 structure is 81.2 . The CuO-Cu bond angles are 135 (cation), 82 (neutral), and 75 (anion). Cu3 O3 clusters have nearly planar structures. The neutral cluster is a quartet while the
charged clusters have triplet ground states. The average Cu-O-Cu bond angles
are 121.8 (cation), 98.1 (neutral), and 94.2 (anion). The Cu-O-Cu bond angles
are smaller than the O-Cu-O bond angles while the CuO are shorter than found
A(cation), 1.90˚
A(neutral)
in the Cu2 O2 clusters. Our Cu-O bond lengths are 1.89˚
˚
and 1.85A(anion). The Cu4 O4 cluster is the ﬁrst nonplanar structure found for
Cun On and consists of 2 copper atoms above and below the plane of a Cu2 O4
unit. A similar structure is found for the cation cluster, while the anion cluster is
planar. The spin states of optimized structures are triplet (neutral) and doublet
(cation and anion.) Our Cu-O bond lengths are 1.92˚
A(cation), 1.94˚
A(neutral)
and 1.81˚
A(anion).

Figure 3 shows the binding energy per atom, Eb , as a function of number of
copper atoms in the cluster. There is a rapid increase from a binding energy of
1.24 eV (n = 1) to 2.22 eV (n = 3.) The n = 4 cluster has a similar binding
energy to the n = 3 cluster, though not close to the bulk work function of >5
eV. Thus studies of larger clusters are necessary to more closely examine the
size evolution of the properties of these clusters.

Fragmentation Channels

We have also calculated the fragmentation energies of (CuO)n (n=1-4) clusters
for various dissociation pathways. The fragmentation channels of (CuO)n clusters are shown in Table 4. The fragmentation energy of Cu2 O2 cluster requires
the least amount of energy to fragment and the lowest energy pathway for all
clusters is to lose a single CuO group.

Conclusions

The electronic and structural properties of small copper oxide clusters have been
studied using density functional theory and several basis sets. Comparison with
existing experimental work demonstrated that the LANL2DZ basis set is in best
agreement and therefore was used study study Cun On clusters. It was found that
the clusters are planar for up to n = 3 and then become nonplanar. Ionization
energies, electron aﬃnities, and binding energies demonstrate some oscillations
with cluster size, as is typical for clusters. Larger clusters must be studied in
order to explore the approach to bulk properties.
