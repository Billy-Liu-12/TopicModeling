Abstract. Nanoelectronics and photonics applications of single wall carbon
nanotubes (SWNT) are feasible only if SWNTs have specific chirality. The
knowledge of the detailed mechanism for SWNT synthesis would allow one to
optimize the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process and may help to gain
control over selectivity of SWNT synthesis. While it is not probably feasible to
study this mechanism experimentally, it could be analyzed using molecular
simulations. Here we propose multiscale computer modeling of CVD process.
High theory level can be used for di- and tri-atomic fragments, in order to
generate parameters for bond order force field. In turn, force field simulations
will be used to characterize the chemical origin and thermochemical properties
of the intermediates and transition states. This will allow predicting the rate
constants for the elementary steps, which are then used in kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations to describe SWNT growth at realistic time scales.

1 Introduction
Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are cylindrical molecules with unique properties.
Many potential applications have been proposed for carbon nanotubes, including
conductive and high-strength composites; energy storage and energy conversion
devices; sensors; field emission displays and radiation sources; hydrogen storage media;
and nanometer-sized semiconductor devices, probes, and interconnects. Some of these
applications are now realized in products, others are demonstrated in prototypes. One of
the difficulties for nanoelectronic applications of single-walled nanotubes is efficient
separation of the nanotubes of different chirality. Increasing chiral selectivity of SWNT
synthetic process could solve this problem.
There are successful attempts for selective synthesis of SWNT [1]. Lolli et. al.
found that using a CoMo catalyst the chirality distribution of the groeing SWNTs can
be reproducibly altered by varying the reaction temperature, the gaseous feed, or the
cluster surface morphology. Specifically, increasing the temperature results in
increase in nanotube diameter, without a change in the chiral angle. In contrast, by
changing the support from SiO2 to MgO, SWNT with similar diameter but different
chiral angles are obtained. Clearly, different chirality distributions obtained when
varying catalysts support or reaction conditions demonstrate that it is the result of

chirality-specific differences in the growth kinetics, which in turn depends on the
nanotube cap-metal cluster interaction. To fully control SWNT synthesis, one needs
guidelines for optimizing the catalyst structure and experimental conditions, which
are difficult to obtain without the detailed knowledge of the mechanism for SWNT
catalytic synthesis.
Computer simulations may be helpful to establish this mechanism. However, only
a few examples are found in the literature that attempt to simulate the SWNT growth.
Reactive empirical bond order (REBO) force field was employed to model the
catalyzed growth of nanotubes by CVD and investigates nanotube stability as a
function of nanotube type, length and diameter through molecular dynamics (MD)
approach [2], Since REBO parameters are not available for metals, no catalyst
nanoparticles (NP) were considered in this study. The effect of iron cluster size on the
structure defects and diameter of the SWNT was reported [3]. Specifically, the study
showed that for large particles, containing at least 20 Fe atoms, the caps grow in
diameter until they have the same diameter as the cluster. Unfortunately, artificially
fast growth rate that made MD simulations feasible, resulted in formation of
extremely defective nanotubes. Therefore, it is of interest to simulate catalytic SWNT
growth using kinetic models, rather than direct MD approaches. The free energies of
the intermediates and reaction barriers need to be obtained, then kinetic Monte Carlo
(MC) modeling can be used to determine the effect of reaction conditions on SWNT
morphology.
Here we describe multiscale approach to SWNT growth simulation. First, hybrid
DFT is used for di- and tri-atomic fragments, to generate parameters for reactive bond
order force field. At the next step SWNT/nanocluster systems are constructed, and
their geometry is optimized for initial and final structures for different steps of SWNT
growth. These structures are then used in MD simulations to identify additional
reaction intermediates necessary to build a kinetic model for stepwise SWNT growth.
We will start with SWNT having N hexagonal carbon rings in it. The SWNT growth
process towards the addition of next ring has number of possibilities through different
intermediates with varied reaction rates. Rate constant k for each reactive step will be
calculated using Arrhenius equation (1).

k = Ae − E a / RT

(1)

Here A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and
Ea is the activation energy. that is necessery for the reactive system to cross the barrier
from one intermediate to the other. A transition states is defined as the state
corresponding to the highest energy along this reaction coordinate and is always a
first-order saddle point in the energy map. Each transition state can be determined
computationally with normal mode analysis by following a specific reaction
coordinate corresponding to a single imaginary frequency. When the rate constants of
the intermediate formation are known, the kinetic model for catalytic growth can be
developed and implemented in Kinetic Monte-Carlo code. Finally, the resultant
growth rates calculations using kinetic Monte-Carlo technique will be repeated for
SWNT of different chirality. The developed protocol will be used to study SWNT
growth with different catalysts under different temperature and feed rate conditions.
The specific combinations of these conditions optimized for maximum selectivity will
be selected for experimental verification.

Here, we have investigated bond dissociation energetics for different spin
multiplicities in gas-phase neutral hydrides, formed by 3d-transition metals from Sc to
Cu. Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively correct
description of the bond dissociation. The resultant calculations from the current study
will be used to parameterize REBO force field for transition metals.

2 Theoretical Methods
Density functional theory (DFT) [4, 5] in Kohn-Sham formalism combined with
approximate exchange-correlation functionals [6] has become a method of choice for
the calculation of numerous properties of molecules and solids. Advantage of DFT is
considerably lower computational cost as compared to high level multireference abinitio methods of Wave Function Theory (WFT) [7]. Unlike force-field approaches,
DFT does not need tedious empirical parameter fitting to produce acceptable results.
In the past decade Transition Metal (TM) hydrides had been used as benchmark
system to study efficiency of Density Functional Theory methods. Barone et. al. used
pure and hybrid DFT functionals BLYP and B3LYP to study transition metal
complexes which includes first row TM hydrides and their cations [8]. B3LYP was
found to give accurate dissociation energies, but somewhat overestimate the bond
lengths and dipole moments. In a detailed study of 3d transition metal systems
including monohydrides Furche and Perdew [9] were not able to reproduce these
dissociation energies with the same functionals and basis sets. Presumably, their SCF
procedure systematically converged to a different local minimum, as symmetryadapted (SA) unrestricted Kohn-Sham formalism (UKS) was used by Borane et. al.
and Broken Symmetry orbitals were used by Furche and Perdew. Among various
semilocal (LSDA, BP86, PBE, TPSS) and hybrid density functionals (B3LYP,
hTPSS), Furche and Perdew recommend functional TPSS as workhorse of TM
compounds. Jensen et. al. [10] has investigated performance of five different density
functionals (B3LYP, BP86, PBE0, PBE, BLYP) for diatomics of first row transition
metal systems. They concluded that success of a functional is system specific, which
means all of these functional are more accurate for certain system and less accurate
for others.
Wavefunction theory (WFT) methods were also employed repeatedly to study TM
hydrides. WFT uses different approximations to exact solution of the Schrodinger
equation given by full configuration interaction (CI) method. Most of them involve
multireference SCF procedure (CASSCF or MCSCF) to treat the static correlation,
supplemented by double excitations (SDCI or SOCI) to account for dynamic electron
correlations. The electronic structure of NiH was investigated using single reference
CI methods three decades ago [11] and, more recently with multireference methods
with or without relativistic effects [12-14]. Potential energy curves had been also
calculated for other first row TM hydrides, including TiH [15-17], CoH [18], CuH
[14, 19], VH [20], and ScH [21]. Bauschlicher et al. [20] studied the first row TM
hydrides (TiH, VH, CrH, MnH, FeH, NiH) using CASSCF/SDCI method. Related
method MCSCF+SOCI was used by Koseki et al. to study both ground and excited
state PECs of the five first row TM hydrides (ScH, TiH, VH, CrH, MnH) recently
[22-24].

Another approximation to full CI was taken by Reiher et. al. [25] to study CoH.
They used density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique that allows
performing CI iteratively without the need to explicitly store any long Slater
determinant expansion. DMRG is making study of larger systems involving transition
metals feasible, and accurately predict the energy gaps between different spin states.
In this contribution we study diatomic transition metal hydrides, using two DFT
functionals and compare their accuracy to the experiment, and WFT results.

3 Computational Details
All calculations were done with Gaussian03 program [26] using all-electron
Wachters+f basis set [27, 28]. Spin-polarized (unrestricted) DFT was used throughout
with no spatial symmetry constraints (broken symmetry, BS). Initial guess was
generated by using Harris functional [29] which is the default option in Gaussian03.
Self-consistent field (SCF) convergence threshold was set to 10-7, and relaxed to 10-5
in a few problematic cases. Initial guess was followed by either geometry
optimization or scan along interatomic distance to plot the potential energy curve. In
some cases (CrH, VH) Harris guess lead to SCF convergence problems, and HartreeFock (HF) orbitals were used as a guess. In a few cases where geometry optimization
was terminated due to convergence failure, and converged KS orbitals were used as
initial guess (BMK orbitals in case of TPSS non-convergence and vice versa).
A potential complication in the study of systems with nearly degenerate energy
levels is the danger of obtaining distinctly different SCF solutions as local energy
minima. When different solutions are obtained for the equilibrium geometry and for
the dissociation limit, the energy difference is no longer physically meaningful. In
order to ensure consistency of SCF solution for all geometries, we built entire
potential energy curves and verified that it does not have discontinuities indicating the
switch from one SCF solution to another. SCF process was started with fractional
occupation numbers (FON) around the Fermi level by using keywords SCF=Fermi
and IOp(5/22=5). The occupational numbers became integer at the final SCF cycles.
The stability of the SCF solution was checked and KS orbitals were re-optimized (if
unstable) using keyword Stable=Opt.
Molden [30] graphical interface was used to examine Kohn-Sham orbitals at the
dissociation limit, and at the points where potential curves were found to be nonmonotonic. For one case (CrH) in order to obtain SCF solution with the lower energy,
spin-polarization of σ-bond had to be inverted to have minority spin density localized
on H atom using the keyword Guess=Alter.

4 Results and Discussion

[32-38], some of the published Wave Function Theory [22-24, 31] and DFT data [39]
are also listed. To calculate the root mean square (rms) deviations for all theoretical
values we used experimental data including the error bars. Based on rms values for
bond dissociation energies, BMK gives the best agreement with experiment, followed
by two WFT methods.

Dipole moments calculated with BMK and TPSS functionals are also reported in
Table 1 and compared to the experimental data reported by Steimle et al. [41-44] and
WFT results compiled by Chong et al. [40]. One can see from the Table 1, BMK and
TPSS values for the dipole moments are in close agreement with experiment for TiH,
FeH and CrD. For NiH the TPSS is in much better agreement with experiment, than
BMK ones. For NiH and CoH the WFT results are in strong disagreement with each
other, which indicated the severe difficulties in description of the electronic structure
of these molecules. This clearly merits the future investigation.
4.2 Potential Energy Curves and Spin Gaps
The potential energy curves for TM hydrides are plotted on Fig. 1-4. The first two
lowest multiplicities for ScH (Fig 1) are close in energy but differ in the bond length,
so that singlet is more stable at the shorter, and triplet at longer bond length according
to BMK results. On the contrary, TPSS overstabilizes singlet at all distances. Only
singlet multiplicity is reported in the previous works [31, 9, 21, 45] including WFT
study by Koseki et. al. [23]

and WFT [23] methods

Fig. 2. Potential Energy Curves of VH with
multiplicity 3 and 5, calculated by TPSS,
BMK, and WFT [24] methods

Two spin multiplicities for VH are reported on Fig 2 at WFT level [24]. Both BMK
and TPSS reproduce this ordering, although the spin gap in BMK is twice larger than
in WFT. BMK result seems to be more reliable as it closely reproduces experimental
De for the multiplicity 5 [34]. The two multiplicities for MnH (Fig 3) are almost
degenerate in both BMK and TPSS, while WFT favors M=7 by 11 kcal/mol. Three
Multiplicities of CrH are reported at WFT [3] (Fig 4), all with different dissociation
limits. Both WFT and DFT predict the ground state to have the multiplicity of 6.
BMK and especially TPSS underestimate the spin gap at equilibrium, as compared to
the WFT predictions, while reproduce it fairly well at the dissociation limit.
The energy difference between the high and low spin states was studied previously
by several authors and found to depend strongly on the fraction of HF exchange. This
can be attributed to the fine balance between the negative HF exchange energy
contribution from the electron of the same spin, which is opposite in sign to the
electronic correlation contribution arising from the repulsion between any two
electrons regardless of their spin. A method which includes the exchange and neglects
the correlation (such as HF) will favor high multiplicities by maximizing the number
of electrons with the same spin. On the contrary, self-interaction error in pure DFT
favors low-spin states. Attempts to improve the relative spin-state energies description
of density functionals include hybrid DFT schemes as well as DFT+U [46]. It was
recently shown that DFT+U is capable of providing the qualitatively correct splitting
in low- and high-spin iron porphyrins [46] and FeO+ [47]. However, when hybrid
DFT approach is adapted, the accurate spin energy gaps can be obtained by adjusting
fraction of HF exchange in DFT functional [48]. Conradie and Ghosh [49] studied
Fe(+2) spin-crossover complexes and found that pure functionals such as BLYP,
PW91 and BP86 incorrectly favor spin-coupled form (covalent description), while
hybrid functionals such as B3LYP lean in the other direction. To correct the latter,
they suggested using B3LYP* [50-52] with reduced amount of Hartree-Fock exchange
in B3LYP from the standard 20% to 15%; the B3LYP* functional has been found to

give improved results. Harvey [53] also found an 15% fraction of exact exchange
yields accurate results in many other cases. It appears that the large fraction of HF
exchange is necessary for correct prediction of the dissociation energies, while
smaller fraction is in better agreement with experimentally observed spin-gaps.

5 Conclusion
As a first step in design of the reactive bond order forcefield for TM compounds, we
used two exchange-correlation functionals including explicit dependence on the
kinetic energy density (τ-functionals) to study neutral hydrides formed by 3dtransition metals (Sc-Cu). One of the functionals selected contained large fraction of
Hartree-Fock exchange (BMK), and another one was a pure DFT functional (TPSS).
Watchers basis sets [28], augmented with f-functions by Hay et. al. [29] were used.
We have taken particular care to obtain the consistent SCF solution, including the
stability analysis and Fermi smearing. In order to ensure the stability of Slater
determinant in the entire range of interatomic distances, the potential energy curves
were plotted and inspected for discontinuities. When found, the discontinuities were
eliminated by using the lower energy orbitals as initial guess to continue the curve
smoothly. The spin orbitals at the dissociation limit were inspected and reordered if
necessary.
Qualitatively correct description of the bond dissociation was ensured by allowing
the spatial and spins symmetry to break, which resulted in some spin-contamination for
several systems at equilibrium. However, our calculated BMK dissociation energies are
in better agreement with experiment than those obtained with high level wavefunction
theory methods from the literature. The next step in this study will be the validation of
BMK functional for the metal-metal and metal-carbon potential curves. These curves
will be used to calibrate parameters for the reactive bond order force field and the
subsequent Molecular Dynamics study of SWNT/metal growth process.
