Abstract. We analyze and simulate a near continuum MagnetoGasDynamic(MGD) ﬂow inside a two-dimensional microchannel with a low
magnetic Reynolds number assumption. Complex physics such as rareﬁcation, electric and magnetic eﬀects are considered in the asymptotic
solutions. This work represents an extension from the classical Hartmann
ﬂow in a two-dimensional channel of inﬁnite length to a microchannel of
ﬁnite length. We obtain a non-dimensional equation that relates the pressure ratio, Reynolds number, Mach number, magnetic Reynolds number
and magnetic force number. We also solved for asymptotic solutions of
compressible gas ﬂow based on the velocity-slip and temperature-jump
wall boundary conditions while maintaining a consistent quasi-isothermal
assumption. Numerical solutions of the same formulation are obtained
for validation of the present analytical solutions.
Keywords: multi-scales, micro-ﬂows, rareﬁcation ﬂows, Hartmann ﬂows.

Introduction

Microchannels are important components for many Micro-Electro-Mechanical
Systems(MEMS).The study of gaseous ﬂows inside microchannels has been an
interesting research topic. There are many reports in the literature about gas
ﬂows in microchannels and micro-tubes. [1] A microchannel for fuel cells, for
example, is of dimensions of micrometers, whereas a channel of conventional dimensions is of order of centimeters to meters. It is well accepted that for near continuum gas ﬂows through microchannels, the Navier-Stokes equations are valid if
a slip wall boundary condition is used. Many researchers have obtained theoretical solutions for the ﬂow distributions along a microchannel with an isothermal
assumption, including the pioneering work by Arkilic et al,[1] and Zohar et al.[2]
Numerically, there are many methods for simulating compressible ﬂows in a microchannel: with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, the Information
Preservation method,[3] gas-kinetic BGK-Burnett equation solutions.[4] Discussions of thermal heating eﬀects are reported as well.[5]
One important problem related to gas ﬂow inside a microchannel is conductive gas ﬂows under external magnetic and electric ﬁelds, or MagnetoGasDynamic(MGD) ﬂows. These ﬁelds can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the internal gas ﬂow
ﬁeld, while diﬀerent placements of electric ﬁeld enables the channel to perform

as a generator, a pump, a ﬂux meter, or an accelerator.[6] This work is an extension from the classical Hartmann ﬂow[6] to a ﬂow in a microchannel of ﬁnite
length with the follow diﬀerences. First, for pressure driven gas ﬂows inside a
microchannel, usually there are large density changes inside the microchannel,
and the average velocity can not remain unchanged in order to maintain a constant mass ﬂow rate. Second, the boundary conditions are diﬀerent. For Hartmann ﬂow, there is essentially no variation in the ﬂow direction; wall boundary
conditions are nonslip and constant temperature; one can use periodic boundary conditions (except for pressure) at the inlet and outlet.[7] However, for microchannel ﬂows with density variations and rareﬁcation eﬀects, we will not use
periodic boundary conditions at inlet and outlet; further, we will specify a set
of general velocity-slip and temperature-jump wall boundary conditions, which
include the continuum no-slip and temperature boundary conditions as a special
case. Third, the pressure gradient inside a microchannel of ﬁnite length is not
assumed constant throughout. Simply taking a linear pressure distribution assumption (after the Hartmann ﬂow) for the present microchannel ﬂow will result
in an inaccurate solution.
The work in this paper is a natural extension from two previous work by Arkilic et al [1] and Cai et al.[5]Along the same vein, the present study follows Cai’s
previous approach [5] for treatments of microchannel MGD ﬂows. A few works
appeared in recent years in the same area of MGD microchannel ﬂow.[8,9] There
are some diﬀerences between the present approach and others: 1. Our study includes a governing equation for temperature necessitated by the Joule heating
eﬀects to obtain the temperature ﬁeld;[5] by comparison, the past work completely neglects the energy equation. 2. We utilize the low magnetic Reynolds
number assumption, which is crucial to simplify the MGD equations; we have not
noticed any previous treatment for the same problem in the literature. Without
this assumption, the magnetic ﬁeld variations in general should be considered;
thus it is unlikely that such asymptotic approach can be consistently formulated.
3. According to the X-momentum equation, we provided the governing relation
between the Re and Ma numbers and two other nondimensional parameters for
magnetic and electric ﬁelds. We then conducted a consistent order of magnitude analysis. 4. We obtain a full set of asymptotic solutions in a microchannel
ﬂow. The nonlinear pressure solution implies that without it the solution for
U-Velocity is incorrect.

Problem Description and Order Estimations

As illustrated by Figure 1, a microchannel has a height of 2d and a length of
L, and the average compressible gas properties of pressure, density, velocity and
number density are po , ρo , Uo , no at the channel outlet. The averaged outlet quantities are adopted to normalize the following governing equations and boundary
conditions. The inlet pressure is several times larger than the outlet pressure,
their pressure ratio is denoted as P . The coordinate origin is set at the inlet

center point, and the X-axis is along the channel centerline, the Y-axis is along
the direction normal to the channel wall. Further we assume:
1. External magnetic ﬁeld is ﬁxed at a value (0, B0 , 0), along the Y-direction
only, electric ﬁeld is along the Z direction only (0, 0, Ez ).
2. The ﬂow is well approximated with a quasi-isothermal assumption.[5]As
such, gas viscosity, μ, thermal conductivity, k, magnetic permeability, μm ,
and electric conductivity, σ, are treated as constants.
3. The magnetic Reynolds number, Rσ = (2d)Uo μo σ, is very small. It renders
a negligible induced magnetic ﬁeld, Bx compared with B0 .
4. The ﬂow is two-dimensional, hence ∂/∂z = 0, w = 0.
5. We assume the electric ﬁeld is linked with the magnetic ﬁeld with Ez =
−KuoB0 , and 0 < K < 1.[7] Hence, we can combine the electric ﬁeld into
the magnetic ﬁeld to estimate orders of magnitude for diﬀerent forces.
6. The channel is not short, which means = 2d/L is small.
A proper order estimation for several nondimensional parameters is crucial to
simplify the governing equations. Hence, we need ﬁrst to estimate the orders
of magnitude
√ for several nondimensional parameters, including Mach number,
M a = Uo / γRTo , Reynolds number, Re = (2d)ρo Uo /μ, magnetic force number,
Rb = B02 /(ρo Uo2 μm ), magnetic Reynolds number, Reσ = (2d)Uo μo σo√, Knudsen
πγ Ma
number, Kn = λ/(2d) ∼
ReRσ Rb .
2 Re , and Hartmann number, Ha =
These nondimensional numbers are based on the quantities at the outlet, and
the external magnetic ﬁeld.
By choosing the whole ﬂow domain as an integral domain [5] and exercising
the X-momentum equation globally, we obtain:
2d(Po − Pi + ρo Uo2 − ρi Ui2 ) = μ

Ui + Uo
Uo + Ui
2L − σB0 (Ez +
B0 )(2d)L
2d
2

Further, we drop those terms with Ui because Ui << Uo for a pressure driven
gas ﬂow inside a microchannel. Then, the following simple relation is obtained:
1 + 1/(γM a2)(1 − 1/P ) ∼ 1/Re + Rσ Rb

(1)

where P = pi /po , and = 2d/L. The parameter K, which is a key physical
factor for the microchannel ﬂow, presents the ratio between the electric ﬁeld
and the magnetic ﬁeld. Here it is considered to be the same order, or less than,
the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects, and it is combined into the factor Rσ Rb .
Eqn.(1) contains four nontrivial terms: 1) the momentum change term, represented by on the left hand side; 2) the pressure drop term applying at the
channel inlet and outlet, /(γMa2 )(1 − 1/P ), on the left hand side; 3) the viscous
force along the wall surfaces, 1/Re, on the right hand side; and 4) the magnetic/electric force which applies to the whole domain, Rσ Rb , on the right hand
side. There are many choices to balance these terms: all terms can share the same
order of magnitudes; or three terms share the larger order while the other term is
smaller; or two of the four terms are larger while the other two terms are equally
smaller; or two of the four terms are large, one term is relatively small and the

658

other term is the smallest. Hence, from the above four permutations, there will
be at least 1 + C43 + C42 C22 + C42 C21 = 23 classes of combinations, and most of
these combinations can have many detailed subclasses as well. Here we are interested in investigating the interactions among viscous stress, pressure drop and
magnetic/electric ﬁeld eﬀects. Diﬀerent parameter orders may result in diﬀerent
simpliﬁed governing equations and diﬀerent ﬂow solutions, including hypersonic,
supersonic and transonic ﬂows, as we illustrated in our previous paper.[5] Here
we are specially interested in slow MGD ﬂows under eﬀects of strong pressure
diﬀerence, strong viscous eﬀects along channel wall, and strong MGD force. In
this study, we select two viable cases with the following parameter combinations
which satisfy (1):
1. Re ∼ , Ma ∼ , Kn ∼ 1; Rb ∼ 1/ 2 , Rσ ∼ ; Ha ∼ 1;
2. Re ∼ 1, Ma ∼ 1/2 , Kn ∼ 1/2 ; Rb ∼ 1/ , Rσ ∼ ; Ha ∼ 1;
Previously[5] we showed that the Reynolds and Mach numbers in these two
cases render a balance between the viscous eﬀects and the pressure drop term.
We intend to set Rσ at least one order smaller than Rb to create a very small
induced magnetic ﬁeld, but the magnetic interaction factor Q = Rσ Rb is assumed
to be as strong as the terms for viscous force and pressure drop.

Asymptotic Solutions

Here the ﬂow quantities are normalized with the averaged properties at the outlet, and the X-, Y-coordinates are normalized with L, 2d correspondingly.[1,5]

where the relations |v| < |u| and |Bx | << |B0 | are used to simplify the source
terms in the momentum and energy equations, Θu = (2 − σu )/σu and ΘT =
(2 − σT )/σT . In (6) for the nondimensional velocity boundary condition, a temperature gradient term is omitted because it is smaller than the velocity gradient
with the two speciﬁc groups of nondimensional parameters.
Further, we assume the following expansions u = u1 + u2 + ..., v = v1 + v2 +
..., p = p1 + p2 + ..., ρ = ρ1 + ρ2 + ..., n = n1 + n2 + ...., T = 1 + T2 . The
last one implies a quasi-isothermal assumption.[5] Speciﬁcally, from p(x, y) =
ρ(x, y)(1 + T2 (x, y)), we obtain p1 = ρ1 as the zero order relation and the
isothermal assumption proposed by Arkilic et al[1] is relaxed.
For the two sets of parameters, the Y-momentum equation simpliﬁes as:
∂p1 (x, y)
=0

(8)

With the low magnetic Reynolds number assumption, the magnetic term is at
least one order smaller than the pressure term. From (8) we have p1 (x, y) =
p1 (x), which greatly simpliﬁes the following derivations.

The zero-order solution for the V-velocity is obtained from the zero-order of
the continuity equation, v1 = 0, and the next order can be obtained from the

The density distribution is approximated as ρ(x, y) = p1 (x)/(1 + T2 (x, y). It is
evident that the density is not constant at any speciﬁc station with x=constant.
The pressure distribution is crucial to the whole set of solution since p(x) and
its gradients dominate the coeﬃcients for u(x, y), v(x, y) and T (x, y). Evaluating

The boundary conditions, p1 (0) = P and p1 (1) = 1 lead to the

Numerical Validations

We perform numerical computations to solve the low magnetic Reynolds number
MGD equations, and compare the results with the corresponding analytical results. The computations are performed with a well-tested general Navier-Stokes

equation solver. The ﬂow parameters are: = 0.06, L = 20 μm, p1 = 2 atm,
p2 = 1 atm, T1 = 300 K, σu = σT = 0.85, oxygen gas, γ = 1.4, P r = 0.72,
μ = 1.919×10−5 sec.N/m2 , wall temperature Tw = 300 K, Rb = 1/ and Rσ = .
When the magnetic ﬁeld is enabled, K is chosen to be 0.0, 0.5 or 0.9. Many of
these simulation parameters are the same as those in our previous paper[5] on a
neutral gas ﬂow case.
Figures 2-3 correspond to a case with K = 0.5, the so-called “impedance
match” case for Hartmann ﬂow.[7] Figures 2 shows comparisons of U-velocity
results, where the velocity-slip eﬀects are evident along the wall while some discrepancies are shown at the outlet boundary. Figure 3 shows comparisons of
numerical and analytical temperature results. In general, the temperature ﬁelds
have the same trends with large discrepancies. Figures 4-6 are based on four
diﬀerent cases: 1) no magnetic and electric ﬁelds; 2) K = 0; 3) K = 0.5; and 4)
K = 0.9. We intend to show some trends by comparing the results from these
four cases. Nonuniform strength of sources terms are added to the X-momentum
and the energy equations for the last two cases. Figure 4 shows the pressure
distributions along the ﬂow direction, with the linear pressure distributions subtracted out. The lines without soiled symbols are analytical results, while those
with solid symbols represent the numerical simulation results for the last case.
Though numerical solutions are obtained for all cases, here we merely present one
case of K = 0.9 for clarity. It is clear that the linear pressure gradient assumed
in the Hartmann ﬂow is not applicable here and it may result in inaccuracies if
used carelessly. For these four test cases, at any speciﬁc station pressure level
increases from case 1 to case 4, indicating that the extra magnetic ﬁeld or electric
ﬁeld results in increasingly stronger impedance to the ﬂow ﬁeld. For Cases 1 and
2, the numerical and analytical results are essentially the same; while for the last
two cases, the nonlinearities become more appreciable. Larger discrepancies are
found for cases 3 and 4 than those of cases 1 and 2. Figure 5 shows the diﬀerent
U-velocity proﬁles for the four test cases at the middle station of the channel,
x/L = 0.5. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are shown to strongly inﬂuence the
velocity proﬁles. Numerical and analytical results are close. For clarity, only the
numerical results of case 4 are shown. Figure 6 displays the proﬁles of velocity

slips along the upper walls for these four test cases. In general, the slip velocities
increase as gas ﬂows downstream, and numerical results are found to agree with
analytical results. Essentially, for the last two cases, the gas ﬂows are both Fanno
and Rayleigh ﬂows due to the wall friction and Joule heating eﬀects. Hence, with
stronger Joule heating eﬀects in case 4, the subsonic ﬂow increases its speed more
signiﬁcantly towards the sonic speed than the that of case 3. Now, we will examine the discrepancies found on the results. 1) The numerical simulation results
are from the whole MGD equations, while the analytical solutions are based on
the simpliﬁed asymptotic equations. If we consider the truncation error O( ) as
an upper limit, there is about 6% theoretical diﬀerence with = 0.06; 2) The
analytical results are actually based on the assumption that the channel is in the
middle of ﬂow ﬁeld without entrance eﬀects; however, for numerical solutions,
the entrance eﬀects are not avoidable due to the presence of signiﬁcant friction
occurring at the inlet region. The uniform free stream needs to “adjust” to the
channel ﬂow around the inlet entrance. The inlet and outlet boundary condition treatment is very subtle, and the outlet boundary condition treatment is
important since the gradients there are large. However, these end boundary effects are not included in the asymptotic solutions at all. Signiﬁcant discrepancies
therefore show up in the V-Velocity and temperature proﬁles. If we use further
longer simulation case, most probably the results shall be better. 3) Betweens
the analytical and numerical solutions, the pressure ﬁelds already have some
discrepancies, and with the small length dimension, dp/dx and dp2 /dx2 must
be huge quantities. For the temperature ﬁeld, the dp/dx term dominates in the
coeﬃcients, and (dp/dx)2 appears in the coeﬃcients N5 and N6 . Hence, it is not
surprising to see that the temperature proﬁles have poorer agreement than the
velocity and pressure results. 4) Analytically, here we only consider the leading
term for the electric and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects but since they are coupled in the
source terms for the momentum and energy equations, some nonlinear eﬀects
are possible. Figures 7 and 8 show the temperature proﬁles and the temperature gradients along the upper wall boundary. As discussed earlier, it is very

results. For cases K = 0.5 and K = 0.9, there are Joule heating eﬀects in the
energy equation. For K = 0.9, stronger Joule heating deposits more energy into
the ﬁeld, resulting in a much higher increase in the temperature ﬁeld. As shown
in Fig. 7, a portion of gas close to the wall is actually hotter than the wall.
Correspondingly, for the last case, heat ﬂux is transferred into the wall instead
from the wall, as shown by Fig. 8. There, it also indicates one important eﬀect
associated with an MGD gas ﬂow inside a microchannel: along the wall, even
when the temperature change is very small, the normal temperature gradient
can be huge because of the narrow channel height.[5] Hence, this shows that the
heat transfer problem in microchannels is of practical importance. For Case 1
(K=0) without any electric and magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects, the temperature gradient
reaches an order of 1 × 106 K/m. By contrast, with magnetic and electric ﬁeld

eﬀects, (K=0.9), the magnitude of temperature gradient becomes much larger
and variant, as shown in Fig.8.

Conclusion

We reported an analysis of rareﬁed MGD gas ﬂows inside a 2D microchannel with
velocity-slip and temperature-jump boundary conditions assuming that the magnetic Reynolds number is low and the ﬂow is quasi-isothermal. By carefully comparing diﬀerent orders of magnitude for the pressure drop, viscous shear stress
at the channel wall, and the magnetic forces, two sets of parameters are selected
and used to simplify the MGD equations. This study yields asymptotic solutions
for velocity components, pressure and temperature. With stronger Joule heating
eﬀects, the Rayleigh process eﬀects become signiﬁcant, and the average pressure,
velocity and temperature inside the channel increases. In general, the pressure
gradient along the ﬂow direction is nonlinear inside the channel, and the velocity
and density distributions are nonuniform. Numerical solutions of the same formulation are obtained to validate these asymptotic solutions; explanations are
provided for the discrepancies found between these solutions.
Future work may include other asymptotic solutions with diﬀerent set of
parameters, and the corresponding solutions to three-dimensional or axially
symmetric ﬂows.
