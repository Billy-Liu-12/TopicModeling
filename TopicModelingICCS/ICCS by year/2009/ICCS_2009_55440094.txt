Abstract. Protein loop structure modeling is regarded as a mini protein folding
problem with significant scientific importance. Efficiently sampling the loop
conformation space is a key step to computationally obtain accurate loop structure models. Due to the large size of the conformation space and the complication of the scoring functions describing protein energy, it is difficult to obtain
broad, diverse coverage of the loop conformations with low energy (score). In
this article, we present a new population-based approach to sample the backbone conformations of protein loops. The main advantage of the populationbased approaches is that various selection schemes can be applied to enforce the
conformations in a population to satisfy certain constraints. In our sampling approach, conformations are generated in the dihedral angles (φ,ψ)-space and the
Differential Evolution (DE) method is employed to implement dihedral angle
crossover for generating new conformations. A diversity selection scheme is
applied to achieve diversified sampling. Using a narrowing gap selection
scheme, decoys satisfying loop closure condition are obtained by gradually
eliminating conformations with large terminal gaps in a population. Our computational results on modeling long loop targets have shown diverse and broad
coverage of the loop conformation space, which leads to consistently reaching
the native-like decoys in the sampling process.

1 Introduction
Protein loop structure modeling is important in structural biology for its wide applications, including determining the surface loop regions in homology modeling [1], defining segments in NMR spectroscopy experiments [2], designing antibody [3], and
modeling ion channel [4]. The value of computer-generated protein loop models in
biological research and practice relies critically on their accuracy. Protein loop structure modeling can be considered as a mini version of the ab initio protein folding
problem. Despite their short length, protein loops exhibit greater structural flexibility
than strands and helices and have few contacts with the remainder of the protein,
which make it more difficult to predict than the geometrically regular β-strands and αhelices [5]. Currently, development of high-resolution computational approaches that
can reliably produce accurate protein loop models, particularly in long loop targets,
remains an unsolved problem. The main difficulties include the large protein loop

conformation space as well as the complicated landscape of the scoring functions
describing the loop energy.
Similar to ab initio protein folding, the rationale of ab initio protein loop structure
modeling is to optimize a protein loop energy function to discover the native-like
conformations [7]. Typically, in protein modeling, the physics-based energy functions
yield a rugged, funnel-like energy landscape, which can easily trap the optimization
process and is extremely difficult to search. Several approaches, such as replacing the
van der Waals potential with a soft-sphere potential [8], switching to a statistics-based
term [9], etc., have been developed to produce scoring functions with “softened”
energy landscape to facilitate the search process. However, such scoring functions
also come with insensitivity and potentially inaccuracy, i.e., a conformation with the
absolutely lowest score may not be a native-like conformation while a conformation
with a relatively higher score may in fact be a more reasonable structure than the one
with a lower score. Therefore, it is well-known that an optimization method seeking
the very global minimum of a scoring function is usually not effective in finding the
true native conformation. Instead, a sampling approach that can efficiently explore the
low score regions in the scoring function landscape is more desirable [10].
For very short protein loop targets, one may be able to traverse the discretized dihedral angles (φ, ψ)-space to completely sample all possible conformations. However,
for longer protein loops, the size of the conformation space grows exponentially
where complete sampling becomes infeasible. Markov Chain Monte Carlo [6, 11] and
genetic algorithms [12] have been applied to sample the loop conformation space to
discover feasible structures with low scores (energy). The existing problems in these
sampling methods include oversampling – the same conformations are repeatedly
generated as well as undersampling – some conformations with low scores are not
reachable during the sampling procedure. Oversampling will lead to wasted computational efforts while more seriously, undersampling may miss good, native-like conformations.
In this article, we present a population-based sampling algorithm to achieve broad
exploration of protein loop backbone conformation space. We use the backbone dihedral angles (φ,ψ) array as a reduced representation of a loop conformation. A modified Differential Evolution (DE) scheme [13] is used to crossover dihedral angles of
selected conformations in an old population to generate new conformations in (φ,ψ)space. A diversity selection scheme is developed to filter conformations in a population similar to those already generated during the sampling procedure, which favors
the sampling process to explore undiscovered conformations with low scores and thus
reduces the chance of repeatedly generating decoys with similar structures. By gradually eliminating the conformations in a population not satisfying the loop closure
condition, our narrowing gap selection scheme can also lead to decoys with loop
closure satisfaction. We verify our sampling approach by applying it to the long targets provided in Jacobson’s protein loop benchmark [14].
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the
general protein loop structure modeling procedure and our population-based sampling
method, respectively. Section 4 shows our computational results on the 12-residue
loop benchmark targets. Section 5 summarizes our conclusions and future research
directions.

2 General Protein Loop Structure Modeling Paradigm
The ab initio protein loop structure modeling procedure [15, 16, 17] typically involves the phases of sampling, filtering, clustering, and refining, although some additional steps may be employed in different programs. Figure 1 shows a conceptual
illustration of these phases.

In the sampling phase, the loop conformation space is explored and decoys with
low scores are produced. In order to reduce the degree of freedom, usually only loop
backbone with reduced representation are used in this phase with simplified, smooth
scoring functions. Afterward, the infeasible, bad decoys will be eliminated in the
filtering phase. Then, in the clustering phase, decoys with similar structures will be
grouped into a cluster and representative decoys for each cluster will be selected.
Next, in the refining phase, side chains are added and complicated all-atom energy
functions are used to locally optimize the representative decoys. Finally, the refined
representative decoy with the lowest energy will be selected as the predicted model.
Broadly sampling the loop conformation space to generate low-score decoys with
diverse structures in the sampling phase is critical in successfully predicting highresolution protein loop models. This is due to the fact that if a native-like decoy is not
reachable in loop conformation sampling, it is unlikely to obtain a high-resolution
model close to the native structure in the refining phase. For the population-based
sampling approach described in this article, we only consider the modeling computation in the sampling phase.

3 Population-Based Diversified Sampling Approach
We develop a population-based sampling approach which intends to diversely sample
the loop conformation space. Initially, a population with N conformations, C1, …, CN,
is randomly generated. Each loop structure conformation Ci with n residues is represented by a vector (θ1, …, θ2n), which represents the backbone dihedral angles of (φ1,
ψ1, …, φn, ψn). The dihedral angles of ωi are kept constants at their average value of
180°. A statistical distance-based atom pair-wise scoring function is used as the sampling scoring function [18]. When scoring function evaluation or structure comparison
is needed, the dihedral angles representation of Ci is converted to the backbone atom
representation. We adopt the Differential Evolution (DE) [13] approach to produce
new conformations for the next population. A diversity selection scheme is designed
to achieve diversified sampling and a narrowing gap selection scheme is used to guarantee loop closure.
3.1 Differential Evolution for Conformation Crossover
DE [13] is a powerful computational method for continuous function optimization,
which has demonstrated its effectiveness on several hard optimization problems with
complicated objective functions [22]. In our loop sampling approach, DE is used to
crossover old conformations to produce new ones in continuous dihedral angles
space. For each loop conformation Ci, a mutant vector Vi is formed by

Vi = Cr1 + F (Cr 2 − Cr 3 ) ,

(1)

where r1, r2, and r3 are mutually distinct, uniformly distributed integer random numbers in the interval [1, N] and F > 0 is a tunable amplification control constant as
described in [4]. Then, a new conformation Ci’(θ1’, …, θ2n’) is generated by the
crossover operation on Vi and Ci:
⎧v

θ 'j = ⎨ j
⎩θ j
where

j= s

, s + 1 2 n ,..., s + L − 1

denotes the modulo operation with modulus 2n, s is a randomly generated
2n

integer from the interval [0, 2n-1], L is an integer drawn from [0, 2n-1] with probability Pr(L = k) = (CR)L, and CR ∈ [0, 1) is the crossover probability. Practical advice
suggests that CR = 0.9 and F = 0.8 are favorable choices in the DE scheme [13],
which is also adopted in our program. Our slight modification to the DE scheme is to
always keep θi in the ranged of [-π,π].
3.2 Diversity Selection Scheme
The diversity selection scheme encodes the capability of enforcing the conformations
in a population to satisfy the diversified sampling requirement. Our diversity selection
scheme is based on the similarity of a conformation s to a given set of generated decoys D = {d1, …, dk}, which is measured by

98

S ( s ) = min dist ( s , d i )
i

(3)

where dist(.) is a distance function measuring the structural difference.
In our implementation, we keep track of the already generated decoys d1, …, dk by
recording their Cα atoms in an array. To reduce computation time of evaluating loop
structure similarity, instead of calculating the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)
of all backbone atoms, we use the Cα RMSD between conformations in a population
and the generated decoys as the distance function. Then, in diversity selection, all
conformations in the current population are sorted according to their similarity to the
generated decoys and the top μ% of the candidates are eliminated, where μ is a tunable constant.
3.3 Narrowing Gap Selection Scheme for Loop Closure
The so-called loop closure problem is defined as follows: given the N- and Cterminals, find a loop backbone conformation of a certain length that can bridge the
ends seamlessly [19]. Inverse kinematics [23] is a common method to solve the loop
closure problem. Unfortunately, inverse kinematics has difficulty to be applied to our
population-based sampling approach because crossing over the dihedral angles of two
or more conformations satisfying the loop closure condition does not automatically
guarantee loop closure in the new conformation.
In our population-based sampling approach, we develop a narrowing gap selection scheme to produce decoys satisfying the loop closure condition. We fix the
position of the N-terminal, produce the loop based on the dihedral angle values in
loop conformation Ci, and then calculate the gap distance, G(Ci), from the Cterminal in the generated loop to the target C-terminal. G(Ci) is then used to measure the loop closure gap. To produce loops closely approximating the loop closure
condition, in the gap selection scheme, we eliminate conformations Ci where G(Ci)
>δ. Here δ is a variable, which specifies the acceptable gap between the predicted
C-terminal and the target C-terminal. At the beginning, δ is initialized to a large
value to allow aggressive loop conformation sampling. The value of δ is decreasing in every iteration toward a small value so as to gradually eliminate conformations with gaps larger than δ and eventually lead to conformations approximately
satisfying the loop closure condition. When the final conformation with the lowest
score is selected to output as a decoy, the C-terminal gap can continue to be reduced by slightly adjusting the dihedral angles of φi, ψi, and ωi in the loop
structure.
3.4 Algorithm Description
By putting every piece of the puzzle together, the descriptive pseudo code of the
population-based diversified sampling algorithm is described as follows. The algorithm can be repeatedly executed to produce multiple loop decoy structures.

4 Computational Results
We applied our methods to the long loop benchmark targets specified in [14], including 17 12-residue, 35 11-residue, and 49 10-residue loops. Due to space restrictions,
we can only report a fraction of our results in this article. Therefore, we use our
computational results on 12-residue loop targets to illustrate the effectiveness of our
population-based diversified sampling scheme. Our computations on the other targets
actually yield similar results.
We use the path length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) [20] based on the
pair-wised RMSD matrix of the generated decoys to measure sampling diversity.
Table 1 shows the comparison of the MST path lengths of the 1,000 decoys generated
by our population-based loop conformation sampling algorithm with and without the
diversity selection scheme. It is important to notice that the diversity selection scheme
plays an important role in the sampling process, which leads to significantly larger
MST path length in all 12-residue loop targets when the diversity selection scheme is
employed. In other words, the decoys generated using the diversity selection scheme
are more structurally different from each other than those without using the diversity
selection scheme. This indicates that the sampling process with the diversity selection
scheme has a broader coverage of the loop structure conformation space and leads to
decoys with more diversified representation of structures.
The diversified sampling of the loop conformation space directly improves the
chance of generating decoys with close structure to the native one. Table 1 also compares the best decoys with the smallest backbone RMSD to the corresponding native
structure generated with and without using the diversity selection scheme in 12residue targets. One can find that in all loop targets except for 5nul(54:65), the population-based sampling process with the diversity selection scheme can consistently
reach decoys with backbone RMSD less than 2A, which is within the experimental Xray crystallization resolution. In contrast, sampling without the diversity selection
scheme cannot reach decoys with RMSD less than 2A in 5 out of the 17 targets.
Moreover, there is averagely 0.37A RMSD shift in the best decoys of the 12-residue
targets when the diversity selection scheme is used.

Our further structural analysis shows that the native 5nul loop (54:65) interacts
with a flavin mononucleotide ligand. The distance-based scoring function used in our
sampling program makes no assumption on any ligands. This explains why in
5nul(54:65) no decoys with RMSD under 2A are generated in our sampling approach
even when the diversity selection scheme is used.
Due to the broad structure representations in the generated decoys, sampling with the
diversity selection scheme will also lead to diversified clusters and representative decoys in the clustering phase of protein loop structure modeling. Figures 2 and 3 show
the representative decoys in clustering the 1,000 decoys in loop target 1akz(181:192)
using sampling with and without the diversity selection scheme, respectively. We use a
simple agglomerative clustering algorithm [21] with 2.0A cutoff. One representative
decoy is selected for each cluster. For the 1,000 decoys generated without using the
diversity selection scheme, 9 clusters are produced. For each representative one of the 9
clusters, a similar structure can be found in the representative decoys from the 19 clusters generated by sampling using the diversity scheme. However, several representative
decoys exhibiting significantly different structures found in sampling using the diversity

selection scheme are not presented in these 9 clusters generated by sampling without
diversity selection scheme, including a native-like one with 1.25A RMSD.
A minor disadvantage of the diversified sampling method is that it may also increase the production of “bad” decoys. This is due to the fact that the diversity selection scheme will increase the chance of discovering not only the “good”, native-like
conformations but also the “bad”, far-deviated ones yielding low scores. As an example depicted in Figure 4 showing the RMSD distribution of the 1,000 decoys in loop
target 1rge(57:68), sampling with the diversity selection scheme leads to larger population of decoys with RMSD less than 2.0A as well as those with RMSD higher than
3.0A than sampling without diversity selection scheme. This problem can be relatively easy to address in the filtering phase of loop structure modeling – when a

5 Conclusions and Future Research Directions
In this article, we present a population-based sampling algorithm for diversified sampling protein loop backbone conformations. A diversity selection scheme is designed
to diversify predicted decoys and a narrowing gap selection scheme is used to achieve
loop closure condition satisfaction. Our computational results on 12-residue protein
loop benchmark targets have shown diversified decoy structure distributions and
improved chance of reaching native-like conformations.
It is important to notice that our approach only targets the backbone sampling
phase in ab initio protein loop structure modeling and the decoy generation time is
usually less than a minute. As a result, our decoys have relatively lower quality compared to the all-atom modeling method such as PLOP [15], which typically takes days
to deliver a model. In the future, we are interested in studying how diversified backbone sampling can benefit all-atom simulation in high-resolution loop modeling.
