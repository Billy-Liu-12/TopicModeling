Abstract. The paper describes an eﬃcient implementation of a photoabsorption model for modern thin photovoltaic (PV) cells. As the modelling of solar cells constitutes a multiphysic and multiscale problem, a
special attention was paid to the speed while retaining a reasonable accuracy. The model is restrained to a normal incidence but accounts for
the whole solar spectrum. Applied transfer matrix method yields an accurate distribution of the light intensity in the semiconductor structure.
Usage of equivalent parameters makes it possible to simulate both plain
semiconductor material and a quantum dot superlattice based material,
which is used to enhance the PV device performance.
Keywords: photovoltaic cell, photoabsorption, carrier generation,
multiple wavelength.

Introduction

Solar cells answer a call for alternative energy by providing a source of a reliable, long lasting power supply. Most designs of solar cells rely on semiconductor
materials based on silicon or III-V semiconductors. Space electronic equipment
requires improvements in solar cell eﬃciency to deliver more eﬃcient, lightweight
solar cells. Recently proposed approaches to enhance the eﬃciency utilize the
novel nanomaterials containing quantum dots [1], and new concepts of cell design. A proper models and simulation techniques are needed to speed-up the
development on novel solar cell devices and reduce the related expenses.
Modeling of a photoabsorption in solar cells is a complex problem that involves multiphysics simulations of multiscale problem at diﬀerent levels [2]. Recent trend of using quantum dots to enhance the performance of a solar cell
by broadening an absorption spectrum and reducing a recombination rate requires modeling at a quantum level. A spatial distribution of the light intensity
in the structure is obtained at a macroscopic level because of the dimensions of
the solar cell. Carrier generation and recombination rates are used in transport
equations in order to calculate a carrier distribution.
Our goal is to develop a simulation tool NanoTCAD [3] that will accurately
predict a performance of a solar cell and allows an inside view that helps in future

designs. The NanoTCAD simulator already implements transport equations in
semiconductor devices. It can compute a steady-state or a transient. Because
of solar cells we are now interested more in the steady-state. A simulation of
a typical design takes 100 – 600 thousands volume elements. For a simulation
of a small problem without details with only 8,000 elements the computation
on 2GHz Pentium PC takes about 25 seconds and such simulation represents
only one point on a I-V curve. Therefore CPU time saving is highly desirable,
especially in time dependent problems, e.g. a radiation damage modelling.
This paper is focused on a simpliﬁed and yet accurate model of photoabsorption to be included into the simulator. The essential part is to compute an
electromagnetic ﬁeld (EM) distribution inside the solar cell. We want to achieve
this without a necessity to implement a full electromagnetic solver that would
substantially slow down the 3D computation.

Geometry of Solar Cells

We consider a sandwitch structure of a solar cell with upper electrodes organized
in a grid and creating rectangular windows for the light to enter into the structure. The incident solar light is a plane wave limited by the window between
electrodes impinging the top surface along the normal. A part of the solar cell is
depicted in Fig. 1. The aperture deﬁnes a horizontal cross section of the beam.
It is assumed that the cross section of the beam doesn’t vary in the vertical
direction due to a shallow geometry of solar cells. Formally, the horizontal area
can be split into three parts: (i) the area under the window where a plane wave
penetrating in a vertical direction is assumed – carrier transport and photoabsorption occur, (ii) the area outside the window with no light intensity – electron
transport but no photoabsorption, (iii) area near the window edge – diﬀraction
and scattering take place. This model is suitable for solar cells because the window is much larger than the wavelength so that diﬀraction and scattering eﬀects
on a border of the cross section can be neglected.
The light propagating through the window of a solar cell can be decomposed
into periodic ﬁelds

It is obvious that for (kx2 + ky2 ) << εr , the value of β is almost constant, meaning
that all waves propagates at about the same phase velocity, and hence, the
horizontal proﬁle is changing very slowly. The relative diﬀerence of the electric
ﬁeld caused by neglecting kx , ky in the expression above is

3, it is required that (kx2 + ky2 )z << λ0 . For an aperture with a diameter a the
components that matter have wavenumbers up to 2π/a (i.e. (kx2 + ky2 ) = λ0 /a).
For a structure with a height about λ0 and a window diameter about 1 cm the
estimated relative error in the center of a window that corresponds to one Fourier
component is about 10−4 .

Plane Waves in the Structure at a Single Wavelength

All properties within one layer are assumed to be constant but dependent on a
free space wavelength λ0 . Electrooptical properties of each layer are described
by a refractive index n and an extinction coeﬃcient k. A general solution in the
j th homogeneous layer is a superposition of two counterpropagating waves

with e−iωt time factor. The complex vectors E +
0j and E 0j represent the values
of plane wave components in a reference depth z = z0j (chosen at the top of the
layer j) propagating downwards and upwards, respectively. Each propagating
wave is a solution of the Helmholtz equation

Given the assumption about geometry and the normal direction of incidence,
the EM ﬁelds vary only along the normal. Any solution of such problem can
be decomposed into two independent polarizations (Fig.1) — S (E = yˆEy , H =
x
ˆHx ) and P (E = xˆEx , H = yˆHy ) — that are just a mutual rotation and both
are described by the same Helmholtz equation (5).
Natural light is not polarized. It means an equal contribution of both polarizations. As we are interested in the power intensity (proportional to |E|2 =
|Ex |2 + |Ey |2 ) and solutions for both polarizations are identical, the formula
E(z) = E0+ e+iK(z−z0 ) + E0− e−iK(z−z0 )

(7)

for a scalar equivalent ﬁeld intensity E = |E| can be used instead. The overall
solution is tailored by applying a continuity boundary conditions across the layer
interfaces for tangential components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds assuming
one of the polarizations.
The usual approach is to use the transfer matrix method [5]. An electric ﬁeld
at each point is represented by two complex ﬁelds E + and E − . In a homogeneous
layer they are given by the subexpressions of (7) or in a matrix form

The total electrical ﬁeld can be reconstructed by assuming no backward propagating wave in the bottom layer (i.e. E0− = 0) and a unit amplitude of the forward wave (E0+ = 1). Then, applying matrix operations (8),(11) yield a recursive

The transfer matrix method calculates the reﬂectance of the structure for an
ideal case. Since the real parameters of semiconductors are not exactly known,
and because of a surface roughness and scattering from edges of the window, the
experimentally measured reﬂectance can diﬀer from the calculated one. Fortunately, there is an easy calibration.
Let Iu be the incident irradiance and Ru a measured reﬂectance supplied by
a user. Then, power (1 − Ru )Iu transmitted into the structure should be preserved. If the calculated reﬂectance from the ﬁrst layer is R0 , then the equivalent
irradiance used in the calculations is
1 − Ru
I0 = Iu

Carrier Generation Rate

Linear photoabsorption refers to a phenomenon of capturing a photon that causes
a generation of one electron-hole pair (e-h). It can be described by the classical
electrodynamics or by the quantum mechanics. In the classical electrodynamics
the interaction with material is described by a complex permittivity, or alternatively, by a refraction index and an extinction coeﬃcient. At this level we are able
to calculate a light intensity distribution in the material which is important for
an energy absorption. The absorbed energy is used for an electron transition and,
hence, links both, classical and quantum mechanical, approaches together.
The total carrier generation rate is contributed by all spectral components for
which a photoabsorption occurs. First, an expression for a single frequency will be
found, then an integration over the spectrum will be discussed. All calculations
assume one dimensional layer structure where the ﬁeld distribution is well known.

Spectrum of the Solar Light

The solar radiation outside the Earth’s atmosphere is described by air mass 0
(AM0) spectrum. The total amount of delivered power is known as a solar constant S. Its value was determined to be 1366.1W/m2 [6]. We use 2000 ASTM
Standard Extraterrestrial Spectrum Reference (E-490-00) obtained from [6] for
simulation of solar cells. Abrupt (noise like) changes in the spectrum (Fig.2)
can prevent an observation of a convergence of a numerically evaluated spectral
integral because of a random choice of sample points. Therefore a cumulative
spectral density Φ was introduced. An irradiance in interval of energies E1 . . . E2
is then
dΦ(E1 , E2 ) = |Φ(E1 ) − Φ(E2 )|

Multiple Wavelengths

Since the system is linear, the ﬁeld distribution (7) can be calculated under an
assumption of a unit incident irradiance I0 yielding the absorbed power within
one cell at the speciﬁed frequency calculated from (22) to be P1cell . Then, it is
multiplied by a true incident power within a small interval of energies dE

Notice that also P1cell has to be recalculated for every λ according to (22).
There are two reasons for that: (i) material properties are frequency dependent
and (ii) optical distance (phase diﬀerence) between layers changes as well.
The integral (26) will be evaluated numerically. The lower limit is given by
the lowest energy with a nonzero quantum eﬃciency η. The upper limit is given
by the spectrum itself. We choose to cut-oﬀ the spectrum at 99% of the total
energy.
The integration of (26) can be performed in a semianalytical way: (i) the
spectrum is split into M subintervals, (ii) an analytical integration is performed
in each subinterval, (iii) partial results are summed together

Numerical Results and Discussion

The modeling of 3D electromagnetic ﬁeld calls for accurate models of semiconductor properties. The refraction and extinction coeﬃcients necessary to calculate an absorption rate are usually obtained by the ellipsometry technique and
can be found in the literature [7,8].
The model was implemented into MatlabTM for testing purposes. 99% of the
AM0 spectrum was considered in the computation. The spectrum was further
cut-oﬀ at the longest wavelength at which a photoabsorption occurs yielding
a range of photon energies 1.375 eV – 4.16 eV. This range was divided into M
subinterval. An convergence of the total deposited charge was observed and
M = 100 chosen based on 1% error. A distribution of a e-h generation rate
G was computed on a standard 3 GHz PC within a fraction of second. Unlike
in the NanoTCAD implementation, the generation rate was calculated along a

vertical axis only in the center of the window. The actual implementation has
to compute G for every cell of the volume element method.
It is not possible to calculate the generated photocurrent without solving
transport equations. Therefore only its order was calculated assuming 60% external eﬃciency [4] and compared with a typical value of 10 mA/cm2 for GaAs
solar cell.
The testing model comprises of a structure in Fig. 1. The cumulative generation rate per unit cross section saturates at 1.46×1021 pairs/m2 /s what represent
100% external quantum eﬃciency. Since most of the structure is created from
GaAs a factor of 0.6 was used to account for the external quantum eﬃciency,
thus yielding 0.85×1021 pairs/m2 /s or 13.6 mA/cm2 which is in the expected
order.
For illustration purposes a distribution of a volume generation rate G is
displayed in Fig. 3. In each material the generation rate decays exponentially
with a corresponding attenuation constant. The wiggles observed between 2 and
3.15 μm are due to an interference of forward and backwards waves. It seems
that the main source of the reﬂection is the bottom InGaP layer that manifest
itself by a 50 nm wide spike of increased light absorption. Similar behavior of a
smaller relative amplitude is observed above the top InGaP layer.

Conclusions

A photoabsorption model for solar cells and technical details of the computation were presented. Extra assumptions were made for solar cell applications:
the structure irradiated by a plane wave, a size of the solar cell window much
larger than the wavelength, scattering on the edges of the window and on

764

inhomogeneities as well as a scattering due to a photon recycling neglected. The
material properties were described by an index of refraction and an extinction
coeﬃcient. In this paper are considered to be known.
The described approach resulted in a MatlabTM implementation of the photoabsorption model for testing purposes and yielded preliminary results. An
absorption rate for one test case is presented in the previous section. The eh generation is mostly deﬁned by the material properties. The total deposited
charge of 13.6 mA/cm2 is found to be in the expected order of magnitude.
The full implementation into NanoTCAD is still an ongoing work. The test
cases include plain binary and ternary III-V semiconductors but the model is
intended for quantum dots superlatices (QDS) as well. Equivalent parameters of
QDS have to be calculated separately.
