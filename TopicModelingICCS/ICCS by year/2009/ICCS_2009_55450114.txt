Abstract. The anti- and syn-conformers of thiophene-2-carbonyl fluoride (A)
and selenophene-2-carbonyl fluoride (B) have been studied in the gas phase.
The transition states have also been obtained for the interconversion of the antiand syn-conformers. The methods used are MP2 and DFT/B3LYP and the basis
sets used for all atoms are 6-311++G(d,p). The optimized geometries, dipole
moments, moment of inertia, energies, energy differences and rotational barriers are reported. This study has been extended to include solvent effect. Some
of the vibrational frequencies of the conformers are reported with appropriate
assignments. The results indicate that in the gas phase the syn conformer is
more stable and the CCSD(T)//MP2 energy differences are 2.97 kJ/mol (A) and
3.02 kJ/mol (B) and barriers of rotation are 38.50 kJ/mol (A) and 36.89 kJ/mol
(B). The structures and vibrational frequencies of (A) and (B) are not much affected by the solvents but the more polar conformer gets more stabilized. The
major effect of the solvents is that energy difference decreases but rotational
barrier increases. The peculiar characteristic of fluorine affecting conformational preference is not observed.
Keywords: Thiophene-2-carbonyl fluoride, Selenophene-2-carbonyl fluoride,
MP2, DFT/B3LYP, energy difference, rotational barrier, solvent effect.

1 Introduction
2-Substituted carbonyl compounds and their analogues are known to show conformation isomerism [1] and thus exist as syn- and anti-conformers. In general, the anti
conformer is more stable but the nature of substituents, in particular fluorine [2], and
polarity of the medium [3], can affect the preference for a given conformer. In a previous communication [4], we reported a conformational study of the furfural, thiofurfural
and selenofurfural in the gaseous and solution phases in order to understand the effect of
substituting the oxygen of the carbonyl group with sulfur and selenium leaving the aromatic ring unchanged. In literature, there have been some attempts to look into the effect
of changing the oxygen of the ring with sulfur and selenium. A brief survey of literature
has been helpful to set the objectives of this work.

First Principle Study of the Anti– and Syn–Conformers

115

Braathen et al. [5] investigated the thiophene-2-aldehyde by microwave, infrared
and Raman spectroscopy and by electron diffraction in the gaseous phase. They found
that the syn-conformer is more stable than the anti-conformer. Han et al. [1] studied
the rotational equilibria of 2-substituted furan and thiophene carbonyl derivatives
using theoretical methods both in the gaseous and solution phases. They also found
that the syn-conformer is always more stable and in the gaseous phase, MP2/631+G(d,p) level predicts that the syn form is more stable by 1.44 kcal/mol for thiophene-2-aldehyde and 0.14 kcal/mol for thiophene-2-carbonyl fluoride. Concistrè et
al. [6] studied the structure and conformations of 2-thiophenecarboaldehyde from
partially average dipolar couplings derived from proton NMR spectra. They found
that the syn form of thiophene-2-aldehyde is more stable. Fleming et al. [7] studied
the syn- and anti-conformers of thiophene-2-aldehyde using density functional
method and normal coordinate analysis. They found that the results obtained theoretically are in agreement with experimental statements of the literature. Apart from
these, there are increasing possibilities for the synthesis of selenophene-2-carbonyl [8]
and derivatives of title compounds have wide applications in the industry [9,10].
Therefore although thiophene-2-carbonyl fluoride (A) has received attention, to the
best of our knowledge, in literature, there is no conformational study for selenophene2-carbonyl fluoride (B). We hereby report an extensive conformational study of (A)
using higher level methods and extend our study to the selenium analogue. In this
paper, the molecular structures, energy differences (∆E) between the syn- and anticonformers, rotational barriers, rotational thermodynamics, and vibrational spectra
have been obtained for conformers of the title compounds, Fig 1, using theoretical
methods. The findings of this work are hereby reported.

H.H. Abdallah and P. Ramasami

DFT/B3LYP and MP2 methods have been used for molecular geometry optimization of the syn- and anti-conformers of (A) and (B). The basis sets used for all atoms
are 6-311++G(d,p). The syn- and anti-conformers have been studied in Cs symmetry.
The transition state arising from syn and anti isomerization has also been modeled.
The transition state involves the planes containing C2O5F11 and the ring containing
hetero atom being at right angle and thus has been considered in the C1 symmetry.
Frequency computations have been carried out using the optimized structures to confirm the nature of the stationary points. Single point computations have also been
carried out at the CCSD(T) level using the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) optimized structures.
Solvent effects have also been investigated by varying the dielectric constant from
1.92 (heptane) to 78.39 (water). All solution phase computations have been carried
out using the integral equation formalism in the Polarizable Continuum model (IEFPCM) [13-16] and all conformers have been fully optimized.

3 Results and Discussion
Some of the structural optimised parameters of the syn-, transition state and anticonformers of the title compounds in the gas phase are reported in Table 1. Several
conclusions can be drawn from Table 1. Firstly, there is little difference between the
values of the different parameters obtained at B3LYP and MP2 level. Secondly, there is
a good comparison between some of the computed parameters and those reported at
HF/6-31+G(d,p) [1]. However, we believe that our structural parameters are more reliable due to the higher level of the methods used. Thirdly, the moment of inertias calculated for the conformers follow the order IA > IB ≈ IC. Fourthly, the syn conformer is
more polar than the anti conformer due to opposing dipoles in the latter. Apart from
these, comparing these conformers with parent molecules [4,17], it is found that hydrogen for fluorine substitution does not lead to much changes in the different optimized
structural parameters except those where sulfur and selenium are involved. Further, it is
interesting to note that the C1-C2 bond length is comparable in the syn- and transconformers but the same bond, about which rotation occurs for syn-anti isomerization,
is longer in the transition state. However the other optimized structural parameters are
almost comparable in the conformers for a given carbonyl fluoride.
Table 2 summarizes energies of the anti-, transition state and syn-conformers of the
title compounds in the gas phase. Further, the energy differences between the antiand syn-conformers (∆E), the barriers of rotation between anti conformer and transition state (B1) and some thermodynamic functions (∆H and ∆G) are also reported.
The results from Table 2 indicate that (i) the syn conformers are more stable; (ii) the
rotational barriers are larger than the energy differences; (iii) the energy differences
and barriers of rotation are comparable for the three methods used; (iv) the effect of
substituting hydrogen of the –CHO group by fluorine does not affect conformational
preference but the rotational barriers and energy differences decrease; (v) the negative
free energy changes indicates that the equilibrium favors the syn conformer and this is
further reflected by the equilibrium being more populated with the syn conformer. The
stability of the syn conformer of (A) is in agreement with the work of Han et al. [1] and
they reported the energy difference as –0.59 kJ/mol computed at the MP2/631+G(d,p) level.

It is found that there are systematic changes in the structures of the conformers of
the (A) and (B) when they are studied in different solvents but these are not significant. To be more precise, the largest change in bond length is 0.012 Å and the largest
change in bond angle is 1.0°. Similarly there are only small changes in the infrared
vibrational frequencies. The most apparent effect of the solvents is that due to solutesolvent interaction, stabilization of the conformers depends on the dipole moments.
The net effect of the solvent is that energy difference between the conformers decreases but rotational barrier increases. However an increase in the polarity of the
solvent leads to a leveling effect of the different parameters. The solvent effect on
rotational barriers, energy differences, enthalpies and free energy changes are summarized in Table 4.

4 Conclusion
This work reports a systematic investigation of the syn-, transition state and anticonformers of thiophene-2-carbonyl fluoride (A) and selenophene-2-carbonyl fluoride
(B) in the gas and solution phases. Some of the results for (A) compare satisfactorily
with literature and the results for (B) should be helpful for reference, as it has not
been studied previously. An interesting outcome of this work is that fluorine is
strongly electronegative and thus can affect conformational equilibrium [18]. However in this case, replacing hydrogen of the carbonyl group by fluorine does result in a
change in conformational preference relative to the parent compounds and this can be
explained on the basis of the opposite charges on sulfur or selenium and oxygen in
(A) and (B). Hence the syn conformer to be more preferred for both (A) and (B).
