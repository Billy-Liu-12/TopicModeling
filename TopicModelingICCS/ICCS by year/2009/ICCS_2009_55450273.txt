Abstract. The spectral element method is well known as an eﬃcient
way to obtain high-order numerical solutions on unstructured ﬁnite element grids. However, the oscillatory nature of the method’s advection
operator makes it unsuitable for many applications. One popular way
to address this problem is with high-order discontinuous-Galerkin methods. In this work, an alternative solution which ﬁts within the continuous
Galerkin formulation of the spectral element method is proposed. Making use of a compatible formulation of spectral elements, a natural way
to implement conservative non-oscillatory reconstructions for spectral element advection is shown. The reconstructions are local to the element
and thus preserve the parallel eﬃciency of the method. Numerical results
from a low-order quasi-monotone reconstruction and a higher-order signpreserving reconstruction are presented.

Introduction

The spectral element method (SEM) with inexact numerical integration is a
generalized continuous Galerkin method [1]. It is h-p capable, relies on globally
continuous polynomial basis functions and the equations of interest are solved
in integral form. The unique feature of the spectral element method is that if
the elements are restricted to quadrilaterals, the integrals can be approximated
by highly accurate Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules within each element. This
allows the construction of compactly supported, globally continuous basis and
test functions which are orthogonal, leading to a diagonal mass matrix. The
diagonal mass matrix allows time-dependent geophysical problems to be solved
with simple explicit or semi-implicit methods and thus the method remains eﬃcient while retaining the geometric ﬂexibility of unstructured ﬁnite element grids.
The method has proven accurate and eﬀective for a wide variety of geophysical
problems, including global atmospheric circulation modeling[2,3,4,5,6,7], ocean
modeling [8,9], and planetary-scale seismology [10]. The method has unsurpassed

parallel performance. It was used for earthquake modeling by the 2003 Gordon
Bell Best Performance winner [11] and has successfully scaled to ∼ 100, 000
processors [12,13].
One caveat of the SEM has its source in the advection operator. For advection,
the SEM can achieve excellent accuracy in the L2 norm mainly because it uses
relatively high-degree polynomials (typically between degree 4 and 10). However,
the fact that the basis functions are globally continuous makes it diﬃcult to preserve discrete analogs of other important practical properties of advection such
as monotonicity and positivity. Traditional SEM results are quite oscillatory [14].
In this work, it is shown how to incorporate local element reconstructions within
a strong-stability-preserving (SSP) time-integrator for the compatible SEM formulation, which yield eﬃcient non-oscillatory advection schemes.
1.1

The Spectral Element Method

Let Ω represent our computational domain. We ﬁrst mesh Ω using a quadrilateral
ﬁnite-element mesh with M elements denoted {Ωm }M
m=1 . Here the focus is on the
case where Ω is the surface of the sphere, and we employ a cubed-sphere based
tiling of the sphere with quadrilaterals as shown in Fig. 1. It is assumed that the
mesh has no hanging nodes, and that each element can be C 1 mapped to the
reference element [−1, 1]2 . We denote this map and its inverse by r = r(x; m)
and x = x(r; m), where x = (x1 , x2 ) are the coordinates of a point in the
reference element [−1, 1]2 and r = (r1 , r2 ) ∈ Ω. Within [−1, 1]2 we work in the
space of polynomials up to degree d, denoted
d

Pd = span{φij },
i,j=0

where φij (x) = ϕi (x1 )ϕj (x2 ) are the cardinal-functions (Lagrange interpolating
polynomials) of the degree d Gauss-Lobatto nodes ξi , i = 0, . . . , d. The cardinalfunction expansion coeﬃcients of a function g are its Gauss-Lobatto node values,
so we have
d

g(ξi , ξj )φij (x) ∀g ∈ Pd .

The SEM uses global piecewise polynomial spaces Hd and Hd deﬁned as

Functions in Hd0 are polynomial in the mapped variable within each element,
and Hd1 is the subset of these functions which are continuous across element
boundaries. Let Md = dim Hd0 = (d + 1)2 M , and L = dim Hd1 < Md .
For functions f ∈ Hd0 , we will rely on the cardinal-function expansion local to
each element

to form a quadrilateral grid of the desired resolution. The Gnomonic equal angle projection is used, resulting in a quasi-uniform but non-orthogonal grid [15].

where the expansion coeﬃcients are the function values at the Gauss-Lobatto
nodes, fˆijm = f (r(ξi , ξj ; m)). Since functions in Hd0 can be multi-valued at GaussLobatto points shared by more than one element, this local expansion representation will contain all such values. For f ∈ Hd1 , the values at any multiply
represented points must all be the same. Note that since f (r(x; m)) is a polynomial of degree d in x and there are d + 1 Gauss-Lobatto points along each edge,
then agreement at these points means we also have agreement along the entire
1
edge, as required for Hd . We note that a global piecewise cardinal function basis
for Hd1 can be constructed by piecing together appropriate combinations of the
φij for either conforming [4] or non-conforming element meshes [16].
1.2

The SEM Divergence Operator in Curvilinear Coordinates

We denote the 3 × 3 Jacobian matrix of the mapping from [−1, 1]2 to Ωm by
Jm , with coeﬃcients (Jm )αβ = ∂rα /∂xβ and determinant J m = |Jm |. A vector
v has contravariant components v α = v · ∇xα and covariant components vβ =
v · ∂r/∂xβ . The divergence operator in Ωm is given by
∇·v =

1
Jm

α

∂
(J m v α ).
∂xα

(4)

To compute this operator, the term J m v α that appears is ﬁrst projected into
0
Hd via interpolation at the Gauss-Lobatto grid points and then this interpolant
is diﬀerentiated exactly with respect to xα by diﬀerentiating (3). We denote the
interpolation operator by I. The sum of partial derivatives are then divided by
J m at the Gauss-Lobatto nodal values and thus
∇ · v ≈ ∇h · v = I

where ∇h · () is the SEM divergence operator. In what follows, only the SEM
operators will be employed, never the continuum operators, and thus the h subscript will be dropped.

The SEM Inner Product

Instead of using exact integration of the basis functions as in ﬁnite-element
method, the SEM uses a Gauss-Lobatto quadrature approximation for the inner
product. The following unlabeled integral is deﬁned as the usual area weighted
integral over the entire domain Ω. This integral is written as a sum of integrals
over the set {Ωm } of elements used to decompose the domain:

We will also deﬁne a Gauss-Lobatto quadrature approximation to the line integral over the boundary of Ωm as

with ds being the arc length measure and n

in curvilinear coordinates is

where the inner sum is over all Gauss-Lobatto points along an element edge
and the outer sum is over (α, β) = (1, 2), representing the element edges where
x2 = ±1 and (α, β) = (2, 1), representing the element edges where x1 = ±1.
Note that the corner nodes, which are shared by two edges of Ωm , appear twice
in this sum.
The compatible SEM employs discrete analogs of several important integral
properties of the divergence, gradient and curl operators [17].The key property

we need here is the divergence theorem within an element. In the particular, the

(10)

This property shows that the SEM will be locally conservative when solving
equations in conservation form. In the SEM one does not need to compute the
ﬂux term, but Eq. 10 shows that the equation has a ﬂux formulation and thus
is locally conservative with respect to the element mass 1, · Ωm .

The SEM Locally Conservative Advection Operator

Consider the advection operator on the surface of the sphere,
∂h
= −∇ · hv,
∂t
with v prescribed and ∇ · v = 0. This problem is analyzed using a forward
Euler time step, and thus the results will naturally extend to higher order SSP
time-stepping methods which are convex combinations of forward Euler steps.
The resulting SEM discretization ﬁnds h(t + Δt) ∈ Hd1 such that
1

ψ, h(t + Δt) = ψ, h(t) − Δt ψ, ∇ · h(t)v(t)

∀ψ ∈ Hd .

The latter is equivalent to the following two-step process:
1. Advance the solution locally within each element,
h∗ = h(t) − Δt∇ · h(t)v(t).

(11)

2. Let h(t + Δt) be the projection of h∗ into Hd . The projection is given by the
1
unique h(t + Δt) ∈ Hd such that
1

ψ, h(t + Δt) = ψ, h∗

1

∀ψ ∈ Hd .

(12)

Step one computes an h∗ ∈ Hd that in general will not be globally continuous
and thus not in Hd1 . Projecting h∗ into Hd1 in the second step requires inverting
the SEM mass matrix.

A Quasi-Monotone SEM Advection Operator

It is ﬁrst shown that a low-order quasi-monotone SEM advection scheme can
be obtained by introducing a reconstruction step between the two steps of the
algorithm given above:

278

M.A. Taylor, A. St.Cyr, and A. Fournier

1. Advance the solution locally within each element using Eq. 11.
2. Let h∗∗ be the the result of a mass-preserving bilinear reconstruction of h∗
with slope limited so that no new extrema are created.
3. Let h(t + Δt) be the projection of h∗∗ into Hd1 .
To show that this method is quasi-monotone, we ﬁrst establish
Theorem 1. Suppose Δt is chosen such that
ˆ
Δt h(t)v(t) · n

≤ 1, |h(t)|

∂Ωm

∀m

Ωm

then step 1 (the SEM local element update) obeys a monotone-element-mean
property,

i,j

Ωm

/ 1, 1

Ωm

≤ max h(r(ξi , ξj ; m), t).
i,j

Proof. For 1, |h(t)| Ωm = 0, such a Δt can always be chosen. Otherwise h = 0
and the inequality is satisﬁed for all Δt. Note that the restriction on Δt is a
standard CFL condition, since 1, 1 Ωm / 1 ∂Ωm is proportional to element edge
length.
To show that step 1 has the monotone-element-mean property, we ﬁrst show
that if h(t) ≥ 0, then 1, h∗ Ωm ≥ 0. By Eq. 10 and the fact that 1, |h(t)| Ωm =
1, h(t) Ωm , we have
1, h∗

Ωm

= 1, h(t)

(13)
(14)

Now consider
g1 (t) = h(t) − min ht (r(ξi , ξj ; m), t) ≥ 0

(15)

g2 (t) = max h(r(ξi , ξj ; m), t) − h(t) ≥ 0.

(16)

i,j

i,j

Applying the SEM advection step 1 to both g1 (t) and g2 (t), we have that
(1, g1∗ )Ωm ≥ 0 and (1, g2∗ )Ωm ≥ 0, which is equivalent to the monotone-elementmean property.
Since h∗ computed in step 1 will not contain any new extrema relative to the min
and max within Ωm , the slope limited reconstruction h∗∗ computed in step 2
will obey the same property. It will be non-oscillatory, but only quasi-monotone
since for high polynomial degree, if h(t) is highly oscillatory within the element,
it is possible that h∗∗ will contain local extrema in one region of the element even
though it does not contain any new extrema with respect to the element min and
max values. The third and ﬁnal step, applying the SEM projection operator, is
a Jacobian weighted averaging of the values computed at diﬀerent elements for
the shared edges and corner points, and is thus monotone preserving.
This quasi-monotone scheme is far from optimal. Numerical results suggest it
is only 2nd -order accurate when applied to smooth problems. It remains an open

A Non-oscillatory Advection Operator

problem to determine if higher-order monotone reconstructions exist and to determine if an an exactly monotone reconstruction exists. Our initial results at
higher-order reconstructions have focused on retaining only the sign-preserving
property. We note that a conservative sign-preserving reconstruction always exists since in the worse case the reconstruction can simply set h∗∗ to the element
average which is conservative and always positive by Theorem 1.

Numerical Results

We now compare the three spectral element advection schemes: no reconstruction, the quasi-monotone reconstruction described above and a sign-preserving
reconstruction. We have implemented these methods into the National Center for

Atmospheric Research’s High Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME)
[5]. Within each face of the cubed sphere, we use an ne × ne grid of elements.
Within each element we use degree d = 3 polynomial basis functions, which is formally 4th -order accurate. The average grid spacing at the equator is 360/(12 ne)
degrees. We do not describe in detail our initial reconstruction algorithms since
they are presented here only to demonstrate the potential of our approach.
We start with the pure advection test from the well known suite of shallowwater test cases on the sphere[18]. The latter concerns the advection around
the sphere of a cosine bell with compact support. The velocity is ﬁxed (rigid
rotation about the north-south axis) and the equation is integrated for 12 days
or one full rotation around the sphere. Contour plots of the initial condition
h(0) and results from the 3 advection schemes after 12 days are shown in Fig. 2.
As expected, the non-limited advection scheme is quite oscillatory, especially in
the region where the solution should be zero, but has very little dissipation: the
maximum of h is reduced from 1000.0 to 994.0 after 12 days, while the minimum
is -5.97. Both the sign-preserving and monotone schemes completely eliminate
these oscillations but have slightly more dissipation, reducing the maximum after
12 days to 992.7 and 959.0, respectively. The minimum of h is zero for both of
these methods.
The cosine bell has a kink at the edge of the bell where h = 0 and thus none
of the methods can achieve convergence greater than second order. To study the
order of accuracy of these methods, we modify the test and instead advect a
smooth Gaussian hill, shown in Fig. 3. We compute l2 and l∞ errors using the
same normalization as used for the ﬁrst test as speciﬁed in [18]. These errors
are plotted in Fig. 4 for resolutions of ne = 9 up to ne = 41. As expected,
the non-limited spectral element advection is 4th -order accurate even on the
non-orthogonal unstructured cubed-sphere grid. The sign-preserving advection

Conclusions

In this work it was shown how to naturally include a function-limiting procedure
within the compatible SEM formulation for the time-dependent pure advection
equation. We then demonstrated that quasi-montone and sign-preserving advection schemes are obtainable by the SEM. The schemes are far from optimal
and thus future work will focus on fully monotone and higher-polynomial-degree
reconstruction procedures.
