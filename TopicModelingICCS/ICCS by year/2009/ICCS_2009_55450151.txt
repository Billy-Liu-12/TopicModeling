Abstract. Single-molecule magnets are perspective materials for molecular
spintronic applications. Predictions of magnetic coupling in these systems have
posed a long standing problem, as calculations of this kind require a balanced
description of static and dynamic electron correlation. The large size of these
systems limits the choice of theoretical methods used. Two methods feasible to
predict the exchange coupling parameters are broken symmetry Density Functional Theory (BSDFT) and DFT with empirical Hubbard U parameter
(DFT+U). In this contribution we apply DFT+U to study Mn-based molecular
magnets using Vanderbilt Ultrasoft Pseudopotential plane wave DFT method,
implemented in Quantum ESPRESSSO code. Unlike most previous studies, we
adjust U parameters for both metal and ligand atoms using two dineuclear molecular magnets [Mn2O2(phen)4]2+and [Mn2O2(OAc)(Me4dtne)]3+ as the benchmarks. Next, we apply this methodology to Mn12 molecular wheel. Our study
finds antiparallel spin alignment in weakly interacting fragments of Mn12, in
agreement with experimental observations.
Keywords: DFT+U, Heisenberg exchange constant, Molecular magnet, Magnetic Wheel, molecular spintronics, quantum computing.

1 Introduction
Single molecule magnets (SMMs) have been of considerable interest to scientists ever
since their initial discovery in 1993.[1, 2] SMMs are transition metal complexes that
have a large spin ground state and considerable negative anisotropy leading to a barrier for the reversal of magnetization. These molecules show slow magnetization
relaxation and can be magnetized below their blocking temperature.[3] The first
SMM to be discovered was [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4]2CH3COOH, 4H2O, a dodecanuclear manganese cluster with a S=10 ground state, that is commonly known as
Mn12-acetate.[1, 2] This complex shows magnetization hysteresis and also shows
quantum tunneling of the magnetization as evidenced by steps at regular intervals in
the hysteresis loop.[3]

Since the discovery of Mn12-acetate, a large number of new SMMs have been reported with a wide variety of topologies and nuclearities, incorporating a variety of
different metal atoms. A majority of molecules reported to show SMM behavior have
been synthesized using manganese, iron or nickel. Manganese clusters that show
SMM behavior are the most abundant. Many derivatives of Mn12 acetate have been
reported to show SMM behavior. Examples of these include [Mn12O12
(O2CCH2But)16(H2O)4 [4] and the mixed-carboxylate complex [Mn12O12(O2CCHCl2)8
(O2CCH2But)8(H2O)3], which were reported [5] to have an S=10 ground state. The
complex [Mn12O12(O2CC6H4-2-CH3)16(H2O)4] CH2Cl2·2H2O reported by Rumberger
et al.,[6] is another SMM with Jahn-Teller isomerism. The complex
[Fe8O2(OH)12(tacn)6]Br8 is one of the most extensively studied iron SMMs; it has a
S=10 ground state and incorporates the ligand triazocylcononane (tacn).
SMMs containing other transition metals such as cobalt or vanadium are relatively
rare. An example of a cobalt SMM is the [Co4(hmp)4(MeOH)4Cl4] complex, which
has four Co (II) ions, was reported by Yang et al. and shows magnetization hysteresis
at low temperatures.[7] The 2-hydroxymethylpyridine (hmp) ligand is a chelating
ligand in this complex. Some of the different topologies seen in SMMs include Mn4
dicubane [8] complexes and the S=9/2 Mn4 cubane [9] complexes. Other interesting
topologies include molecular wheels and rod-shaped SMMs such as the Mn6 clusters.
One-dimensional chains of weakly interacting SMMs are also known, such as the
complex [Mn4(hmp)6Cl2]n(ClO4)2n, reported by Yoo et al.[10] Perhaps the most interesting of these topologies is that of the wheel-shaped SMMs. Scientists have been
fascinated with molecular wheels for a number of reasons. Odd-numbered molecular
wheels, such as [(C6H11)2NH2]·[Cr8NiF9(O2CC(CH3)3)18] are of interest to scientists
studying spin frustration.14 One of the smallest of these molecular wheels is the recently reported tetranuclear manganese complex, with the formula
[Mn4(anca)4(Htea)2(dbm)2]2.5 Et2O.[11] Larger wheels include the Mn24 wheel, reported in 2006, which consists of eighteen Mn(III) ions and six Mn(IV) ions linked
together to form a wheel-shaped topology.[12] It is believed that molecular wheels
could be used in design of quantum computer.[13]
The family of wheel-shaped complexes that shows SMM behavior is steadily
growing. Among these complexes are the Mn22 wheel [14] and the Mn84 wheel, which
is the largest wheel-shaped SMM known to date. The largest reported spin ground
state for a wheel-shaped SMM is the S=14 ground state reported for the complex
[Mn16O2(OCH3)12(tmp)8(CH3COO)10]·3Et2O.[15] Among the family of wheel-shaped
SMMs is a smaller family of single-stranded wheels including the Mn16 wheel 23,
which has the largest single-stranded loop known to date and was reported in 2005. A
series of [Mn12] wheels reported by Rumberger et al. [6] in 2005 are also examples of
single-stranded wheels.
In this contribution we predict Heisenberg exchange constant for Mn-based magnetic wheel using DFT+U method. We successfully validated the method for two
Mn(IV) bimetallic system and then applied the same protocol to predict the value of
the Heisenberg constant, which could not be predicted in the previous study using
Hybrid Density functional theory.[16]

2 Computational Details
All the reported calculations were done using the PWSCF package,[17] which utilizes
PBE exchange-correlation functional, Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials [18] and a
plane-wave basis set. The energy cutoffs for the wave functions and charge
densities were set at 35 and 360 Ry to ensure total energy convergence. The
Marzari-Vanderbilt [19] cold smearing with smearing factor 0.0008 was used for spin
polarized calculation. All molecular structures were optimized in ferromagnetic state
starting from atomic coordinates, obtained with X-Ray diffraction experiments. First
we validated our method for two Mn(IV) complexes (I and II) and then applied to the
Mn12 complex, referred as complex III. The DFT+U method described by Cao et.
al.[20] was used for the calculations. We applied Hubbard U parameter on Mn atom,
as well on the ligand oxygen and nitrogen atoms, coordinating the Mn atom. Since the
Quantum-ESPRESSO code doesn’t allow using U parameter on nitrogen, we modified the source code accordingly. Self-consistent Hubbard-U method has been incorporated to determine the U value for Mn which turns out to be 2.6 eV for this system.
For oxygen and nitrogen we used the U values of 1.50 eV. Local Thomas-Fermi mixing mode was used to improve SCF convergence.

3 Results and Discussions
To obtain Heisenberg exchange constant of molecular magnet, we used DFT+U
method and we used U parameter on both the coordinating centers and on the transition metals. The Heisenberg Hamiltonian in general can be written as

H = − ∑ J ij .Si .S J
here J represents the coupling constant between the two magnetic centers Si and Sj.
The positive J values indicate the ferromagnetic ground state and the negative indicate antiferromagnetic ground state.
3.1 Calculation of J for Bimettalic Mn(IV) Complexes and Validation of U
Values
We started with the X-ray crystal structures of two molecules having bi-manganese
(IV) center represented in Fig.1 (complex I) and Fig.2 (complex II). The difference
between the two molecules is the acetate bridge in the complex II. According to the
previous study,[21] the Hybrid DFT is unable to predict the J values for complex II
and some other molecules with acetate bridge[21, 22], while it was successful for the
complex I. Though BSDFT method is the most used method to predict theoretical J
values, but for complexes having specific ligand or for very small value of
Heisenberg exchange constant, [23-26] this method is not successful so much. That
calculation reported the J value ~ -37 cm-1 whereas the experiment reports -100 cm-1.
The reason for failure in predicting J suggested as the BS-DFT approach [27] fails to
predict the Heisenberg exchange constant related to the delocalization of unpaired
electron orbitals over both manganese centers. To deal with this problem we followed

154

S. Gangopadhyay et al.

the procedure used by Cao et. al.[20] in order to predict J. By adjusting two different
U values (one for Mn atom, and another for N and O atoms), we obtained a reasonable agreement with experimental J values for both complexes I and II. The results
are reported in the Table 1. The J values for complex I and complex II using BS-DFT
method are obtained from reference [21], for complex III [16] the cited J is the
Heisenberg exchange constant between Mn1 –Mn6′ center.

3.2 Calculations of J for Mn12 System
After validating the value for both molecular magnet having Mn(IV) center we applied our protocol for Mn12 wheel [Mn12(O2CMe)14(mda)8] (where mda is N-methyl
diethanolamine). The Mn12 wheel has two different valence centers with different
coordinations (the Mn(III) is hexa- and Mn(II) is penta-coordinated). Fig. 3 shows the
spin arrangement predicted by previous DFT study [2].
The reason for using the parameter U for both the p and d orbital was explained by
Cao et al.[20] They suggested that Coulomb interactions between oxygen 2p electrons
are comparable to those between d electrons, [30, and 31] and should hence be taken
into consideration as well. However, since oxygen usually bares a fully occupied pshell, this correlation effect is often negligible. Therefore, in most cases, DFT+Ud can
already yield a satisfactory description of the ground state without oxygen 2p-electron
corrections. Nevertheless, DFT+Ud,p has to be taken into consideration explicitly here
for both the 3d and oxygen 2p electrons in order to obtain the correct ground state for
this molecule. Previous B3LYP study on this molecule [2] was unable to predict the
correct antiferromagnetic ordering for Mn1′- Mn6 and Mn1-Mn6′ center shown in
Fig. 4, where zero J value was obtained. This study, however, did not consider the
entire molecule due to its large size. The molecule was divided into smaller fragments
that contained only two or three Mn centers. In our calculation we used all twelve
manganese centers and optimized the geometry with PBE exchange-correlation functional. Thus obtained relaxed geometry was then used to calculate the J parameter
between 6-center fragments, described in Fig. 4. The energy difference between two
states shows this center has antiferromagnetic coupling, which is in agreement with
the experiment [2] which suggested a S=7 ground state of the [Mn12O2CMe)
(HO2CMe)3(OMe)2-(mda)].

The dashed line separates the two S=7/2 fragments that are coupled by the interactions between
Mn1–Mn6′ and Mn1′–Mn6; if these interactions are antiferromagnetic (negative J values), the
resultant spin of the complete molecule is S=7. [16].

4 Conclusions
We have performed DFT and DFT+U calculations for two Mn2 (IV) and one Mn12
molecular magnets. Because of the strong magnetic orbital delocalization in these

systems, the broken symmetry pure DFT and hybrid DFT approach fails to predict
correct exchange coupling parameter values. The inclusion of a Hubbard-U like term
for both the Mn 3d and O, N 2p electrons greatly enhances the localization of the
magnetic orbitals for both high and low spin states, and is essential in order to obtain
the correct ground-state and exchange-coupling parameter values. These properties
were successfully reproduced by the Quantum ESPRESSO plane-wave pseudopotential DFT calculations.
