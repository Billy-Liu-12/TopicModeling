Abstract. Experimental investigations of tumors often result in data reﬂecting very complex underlying mechanisms. Computer models of such
phenomena enable their analysis and may lead to novel and more eﬃcient
therapy strategies. We present a generalized ﬁnite element mechanochemical model of a solid tumor and assess its suitability for predicting
therapy outcome. The model includes hosting tissue, tumor cells (vital
and necrotic), nutrient, blood vessels and a growth inhibitor. At a certain
time instant of the tumor development virtual therapies are performed
and their outcomes are presented. The model is initiated with parameters either obtained directly from the available literature or estimated
using multi-scale modeling. First results indicate the usefulness of multiphysics tumor models for predicting therapy response.

Introduction

According to the World Cancer Report, 12 million new cancer diagnoses are
expected worldwide this year, and by 2010 it will be the leading cause of death.
Better understanding tumor formation is of utmost social, economic and political importance, and ﬁnding more eﬀective therapies may be regarded as one of
the biggest challenges of our time. Computer simulation may bring new insights
into the underlying mechanisms and may help to predict and optimize the effects of therapies. Simulation of such complex systems are computationally most
demanding, yet the rapid development of hardware, especially emerging distributed parallel computing concepts, enable more and more realistic modeling
of physiological systems. Tumor development has been studied extensively over
the last three decades, reviews and exhaustive survey of the approaches can be
found elsewhere [1,2] or more recently in [3]. A further discussion of the relevant
literature may be found in our previous works [4,5]. We continue to rely on the
established methods from solid mechanics and chemical engineering. The ﬁnite
element method (FEM) is particularly suitable for describing strain-induced cellular responses, gaining acceptance as an inﬂuential player in simulating tissue
development [6,7]. With such a representation we can account for mechanical
tissue deformations induced by developing pathologies and capture its interplay
with the chemical environment. We focus on benign, vascularized, solid tumor

more realistic boundary conditions for the growth factor and oxygen;
tumor compartmentalization;
deformation of the vascular system (displacement due to tumor growth);
eﬀects of applying a growth inhibitor.

We do not only aim to simulate the tumor growth but also employ the model
to study the eﬀect of therapies. After describing the model we present its application to the simulation of embolization and the administration of angiostatin.
Once precise experimental data are available for particular tumor types, we can
integrate this quantitative knowledge into our framework and oﬀer practical tools
of clinical relevance.

Definition of the Model

The basis of our model is a set of mass and force balance equations. The
mass transport of all constituents is modeled with reaction-convection-diﬀusion
equations. Growth factor, endothelial cells, oxygen, and growth inhibitor are
transported through the tissue, and may enter chemical reactions anywhere in
the whole domain, which is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The components of
this linked bio-chemo-mechanical model are described in the following equations
where ci denotes a concentration of a constituent, Di is its diﬀusion coeﬃcient
and Rij the reaction/source term. We assume no flux boundary conditions where
the inﬂow from the environment is not accessible.
The growth factor is produced in hypoxic regions of the tumor and decaying
naturally or through inhibition:

with no flux boundary condition on δΩ1 . We complete the above system of massbalance equations by adding a force-balance equation describing the mechanical
stress resulting from the evolution of the system as a consequence of tumor
growth (Newton equilibrium equation)
∇ · σ + f = 0.

(7)

σ is a second order tensor, f is the external force ﬁeld. Here we pose a no displacement boundary condition everywhere on δΩ1 and an initial strain condition
in Ω2 .
Growth Model: Healthy tissue is in a dynamic balance between proliferation and
ceasing of cells, in consequence the number of cells remains nearly constant. The
process of controlled cell death - apoptosis - is an integral part of the constant
renewal of tissue in the natural cell cycle. The control mechanism is part of the
homeostasis required by living organisms to maintain their internal states within
certain limits. The down-regulation of apoptosis in tumorous tissue leads to an
over-proportional growth. Apoptosis involves a series of biochemical events. The
natural mechanism of apoptosis is controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic agents.
Once initiated, apoptosis results in a characteristic cell shrinkage, blebbing, and
DNA fragmentation. Such, the cell may be phagocytosed safely without exposing
the tissue with potentially harmful intracellular debris. In contrary, necrosis is an
uncontrolled death, e.g. due to hypoxia or toxic agents, and is characterized by
an uncontrolled bursting of the cell membrane with a release of the constituents.
This leads to a local inﬂammation and only partial resorption of the debris can

be achieved. The overall density of cells inside the tumor N can be therefore
decomposed into two compartments, vital N + and necrotic N − cells:
N (t, x, y) = N + (t, x, y) + N − (t, x, y).

(8)

In our model, proliferation is constrained by the availability of oxygen [7,9]
and space [10]. We account for tumor cells proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis.

All the equations introduced above are solved numerically with a generalized
convection-diﬀusion-reaction solver relying on a standard ﬁnite element discretization. The domain has been mapped with triangular meshes, typically
consisting of 50-100.000 triangles.

and can also be negative, meaning cell degradation and removal. To solve the presented equations we rely on a commercial FEM package, Comsol Multiphysics.
We veriﬁed this solver extensively with common benchmarks like ﬂow past a
cylinder, forced convection or a wall mounted bar sinking with gravity, where
we found very good agreement with the reference solutions.

Example Application

In this section we present an application of our model to evaluate therapeutic
eﬀects. The realism of the simulation is obviously very sensitive to the parameter
choice and determination of these parameters is a challenging part of tumor
simulation. The parameter set of any speciﬁc tumor type is not fully known.
Some of the parameters are diﬃcult to access by experiment, others are being
reported diﬀerently by diﬀerent authors. It is not the aim of this study to take
precise, well-deﬁned parameters for one particular tumor type. Instead, for this
study we want to prove the feasibility of the presented modeling approach and
will rely on the literature or estimates to obtain the model parameters.
3.1

Model Parameters

Besides the set of parameters listed in Fig. 2 we will elucidate only the ones
determined via additional considerations. The delivery of oxygen depends on the
partial pressure diﬀerence in the blood and the tissue. It increases in hypoxic
regions, while in regions with high concentrations only little oxygen is delivered:
R31 (c3 , c2 ) = R0 (c2 ) − Rp (c2 )(c3 − c03 ).

(16)

The reaction term parameters R0 , Rp and c03 depend on factors such as the EC
density c2 . The actual terms are derived in the next section.
O2 consumption: The actual value of oxygen consumption [11,12] depends on
many factors, including the tissue location, physical activity and altitude. For
the consumption we assume a logistic term

where ch3 is the concentration at which the reaction term reaches half maximum
and p controls the shape of R32 (c3 ). This reﬂects the fact that the consumption
is bounded by the amount of oxygen available but also saturates if oxygen is
unlimited.
Oxygen Source Terms: The approximate form of the oxygen source terms can
be estimated based on following observations. For a vessel segment of length L,
radius Rs and wall thickness ws the exchange of oxygen with the surrounding
tissue depends on the oxygen gradient, respectively the partial pressure diﬀerence

Initialization and Growth

The simulations are initiated with a small cluster of tumor cells in the center of
the host tissue surrounded by vessels on each side. The corresponding high EC
density is visible in Fig. 4 as a decaying gray shadow gradient at the box walls.
The tumor promotes directed vessel growth via secretion of tumor angiogenic
factors (TAF), leading to EC migration from the adjacent parent vessels. In
this vascular phase the tumor expands virtually unbounded and will eventually
cause physiological problems due to compression of the surrounding tissue. The
EC density increase the corresponding vessels’ diameter and wall thickness in
time, which in turn modulates their oxygen delivery rate. For large vessels, blood
ﬂow increases and diﬀusion through the wall decreases. For capillaries it is the
contrary: most of oxygen exchange is realized here, but the net mass ﬂux is small.
To obtain the distributions of vessel diameters we solve a Dirichlet problem inside
the domain by ﬁxing the vessel diameters at the boundaries to the expected
diameters (feeding arterioles, 50 μm). The equation parameters are determined
experimentally to achieve capillaries of about 5 μm radius in the center of the
domain. The unregulated tumor growth is presented in Fig. 4 left (EC) and Fig. 3
(oxygenation map). Non-symmetrical compartments develop despite the initial
boundary symmetry. EC density is realized with a typical capillary buildup in
the center of the host tissue in form of a frequently observed vascular capsule.

Fig. 4. EC density within the host tissue. Left: unregulated growth; center: embolization of the lower vessel; right: tumor after angiostatin infusion.

Four branches of vessels are clearly visible, connecting the tumor to the feeding
arteries on the periphery. The tumor itself is penetrated by a dense network of
capillaries, as often actually observed.
Growth inhibition through embolization: Embolization is a minimally-invasive
procedure involving a selective occlusion of blood vessels, by introducing an artiﬁcial embolus (coil, particle, foam, plug). The purpose of embolization is to permanently block the blood ﬂow to the tumor, leading to immediate tissue hypoxia
and eventually necrosis. In our simulation the tumor grows initially unbounded,
supported by the accompanying angiogenesis for 4 months. The virtual embolization procedure is performed by disabling the lower feeding artery. We implement
it by replacing the Dirichlet boundary condition by a non-penetration condition.
Note, that we do not remove any existing daughter vessels that sprouted oﬀ. This
relatively well approximates the fact that only blood supply is eliminated, but
neither the blood vessels nor endothelial cells. The EC density concentration 6
months after treatment in Fig. 4 (center) shows an asymmetric appearance. The
vessel density in the lower half is greatly reduced, which corresponds to a ceasing

treatment; dashed line: Angiostatin treatment; dot dashed line: embolization.

723

of the respective feeding vessel. The capillary core is still maintained, and shows
only slight signs of asymmetry in the lower part. Obviously the capillaries still
suﬃciently supply the tumor with oxygen, such that the vessel network can be
maintained through preexisting anastomosis. As the daughter vessels were not
removed, they are still a part of a network and continue to deliver oxygen. In
Fig. 5 we can, however, observe that the total mass of the tumor is somewhat
lower than in the unregulated case.
Growth inhibition through Angiostatin: Next we test the infusion of angiostatin
(AST), a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. There are several ways angiostatin
inﬂuences the tumor and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood
[13,14]. In the study we introduce angiostatin locally in the 4th month of tumor development and continue its administration till the end of month 10. This
inhibitor neutralizes the growth factor directly as described by (2). We apply
AST oﬀ-center in the lower left quadrant and not inside the tumor, to prevent
the vessels from reaching the tumor at all. In Fig. 4 (right) we notice a strongly
asymmetric EC density distribution, where the AST supplied area is excluded
from any vessel growth. The local concentration of AST does not actually prevent the vessels from connecting to the tumor. Instead, the EC density builds
clearly deﬁned feeding vessels around the AST supplied area. The EC density
accumulates outside the AST application region and is able to form a dense
capillary capsule. We were not able to ﬁnd data in the literature for the reaction
rate between AST and the TGF, and it was arbitrarily set 1:1, justiﬁed to some
extent by the similar molecular weights of the two factors.

Discussion and Outlook

The results from our extended model are in a reasonable qualitative agreement
with commonly available ﬁndings. The improved modeling of EC added further
physiological realism, since we managed to model the capillary penetration of the
tumor and are now able to achieve tumor compartmentalization as seen in Fig. 3.
This approach generates reasonable results, which make it a viable alternative to
the expensive explicit modeling of the vessels. The origin of asymmetric phenotypes from symmetric boundary conditions we will consider closely with reﬁned
meshes. We will further extend the scope of our model, to cover also other aspects
like thermal eﬀects, hormonal, radiation or chemotherapy. The tumor model is
generally diﬃcult to validate since many of the parameters are unknown or carry
large measurement errors. It is the most diﬃcult challenge to quantify these eﬀects
on the cellular level, which is the reason why the simulation outcome can not be
currently validated against the physiological ﬁndings. After all the development
of the tumor may be assessed on the macroscopic level, comparing the tumor regression to in vivo diagnostic observation (CT, US, MRI). We are convinced of the
great value of the computational model once parameters are available from measurements. Here we are especially interested in verifying mechanical eﬀects as it is
one of the major beneﬁts of relying on FEM methods for the simulation.
