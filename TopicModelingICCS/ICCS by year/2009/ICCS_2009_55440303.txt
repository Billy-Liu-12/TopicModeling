Abstract. Mobile P2P networks have potential applications in many
ﬁelds, making them a focus of current research. However, mobile P2P
networks are subject to the limitations of transmission range, wireless
bandwidth, and highly dynamic network topology, giving rise to many
new challenges for eﬃcient search. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
search approach, which is automatic and economical in mobile P2P networks. The region covered by a mobile P2P network is partitioned into
subregions, each of which can be identiﬁed by a unique ID and known to
all peers. All the subregions then construct a mobile Kademlia (MKad)
network. The proposed hybrid retrieval approach aims to utilize ﬂoodingbased and DHT-based schemes in MKad for indexing and searching according to designed utility functions. Our experiments show that the
proposed approach is more accurate and eﬃcient than existing methods.

Introduction

Mobile communication technology continues to proliferate in recent years, and
mobile P2P network has been suggested as a potential solution for eﬃcient data
sharing, message transferring, information retrieval etc. As a consequence, many
new applications naturally arise in telecommunication, commercial and civilian environments, such as mobile phone ﬁle sharing, commercial advertisements
(ads) broadcasting [1] and traﬃc estimation [2], making them a focus of current
research. Mobile devices (peers) in mobile P2P networks interact during physical
encounters in the real world and engage in short distance wireless exchanges of
data. Typically, mobile P2P networks enable direct real-time sharing of services
and information among distributed peers. In contrast to wired P2P networks
that are composed of static peers, mobile P2P networks are subject to the wireless bandwidth, limitations of transmission range, and highly dynamic network
topology, giving rise to new challenges for research on routing, search, data

consistency maintenance, etc. The following two scenarios motivate our research
on search in mobile P2P networks.
Scenario 1: Retrieving commercial ads information. A mobile P2P network can be constructed for dispatching instant and latest commercial ads. For
example, staﬀs in a supermarket or petrol station can use their handheld devices,
e.g., PDA and handphone, to publish the instant ads on today’s promotion and
discount information. Customers of interest with mobile devices can share the
information with others when they are moving on roads because of the incentive
mechanism. Mobile peers in an initiative mode can search other mobile peers’
information under this environment to retrieve commercial ads of their interests.
In such a mobile network, the inﬂuence of instant ads can be broadcasted and
increased to more customers and wider areas.
Scenario 2: Retrieving traﬃc information. Many centralized traﬃc information systems have been deployed to provide traﬃc information of a region
for mobile users, e.g. drivers, by broadcasting the information into air. In such
traditional centralized mobile networks, each mobile peer has to communicate
with the central server. However, many drivers have experienced the common
woe of slow response or losing signals on their mobile devices when the bandwidths are most needed. Consequently, traﬃc information may not be updated
timely and continuously, often leading to unpleasant traﬃc jams. In mobile P2P
networks, peers can generate realtime text messages regarding the traﬃc and
share them with other peers to understand the traﬃc situations just in time.
If a mobile peer is heading to city, he/she can initiatively send a query to the
mobile P2P network constructed by all the active mobile devices in the area
to get the current traﬃc information of the city. In such an environment, the
query is ﬁrst forwarded to the mobile peers having city traﬃc information and
then the results are routed back the querying peer. Having timely traﬃc information, mobile peers can avoid traﬃc jams and improve the traﬃc situations of
the city.
In this paper, we study the problem of search in mobile P2P networks, where
each published message is a document. We use the boolean model (i.e. exact
match) to retrieve information in mobile P2P networks. In traditional structured P2P networks, Distributed Hash Table (DHT) [3] based data retrieval
techniques, given a key, the query will be routed to a speciﬁc peer, which is responsible for storing the value associated with the key. However, due to the peers’
frequent mobility, the DHT-based retrieval technique alone is not expected to
perform equally well in mobile P2P networks due to high DHT maintenance cost.
In unstructured P2P networks, the ﬂooding-based technique is the most popular
data retrieval one. Flooding entails message processing at every peer. However, it
is expensive in terms of communication cost and computational resources in mobile P2P networks. To achieve eﬃcient retrieval, we propose a Hybrid Retrieval
approach (HR), which is automatic and economical. In the mobile network, a
region partition service can be deployed to be known to all participating peers
since vehicle-based peers have the GPS function. The region covered by the
network is divided into subregions that construct a mobile Kademlia (MKad)

network. HR is designed to utilize ﬂooding-based and DHT-based schemes for
quick search.
The main contributions of this paper include: First, we present a novel mobile
DHT based on subregions: MKad and its maintenance mechanisms. Second, we
propose an eﬀective and eﬃcient search approach named Hybrid Retrieval (HR)
in mobile P2P networks. HR is self-adaptive to choose either ﬂooding-based
scheme or DHT-based scheme for eﬃcient indexing and searching by analyzing
their expected search cost according to cost functions in mobile P2P networks.
Third, we conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our methods by conducting
an extensive performance measured by search recall, query latency, query routing
eﬃciency.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the
related work. In Section 3, we propose a mobile DHT based on Kademlia. We
present a hybrid retrieval approach in Section 4. In Section 5, we show the
experimental results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with a discussion
about our future work.

Related Work

There are few existing works on search in mobile P2P networks. The Geographic
Hash Table (GHT) system [4] has been initially developed for data storage in
sensor networks. Its beneﬁts would be that a responsible cell may be empty
without any negative inﬂuences, where a perimeter used for storing the location
information would simply be outside of the responsible cell. Thus, the robustness is increased. In contrast, GHT may increase complexity of the scheme in
combination with a higher network load for maintaining the information in the
system. GHT stores information in those peers that form a perimeter around a
point. This point in Hierarchical Location Service (HLS) [5] would be the center
of the responsible cell. The peer closest to this point is responsible for regularly
sending the information to the other members of the perimeter. If the closest
peer fails, another member of the perimeter will sent an update after a timer has
expired and a new closest peer can be elected. The geographic location system
(GLS) [6] is a scalable location service that performs the mapping of a node
identiﬁer to its location. GLS can be combined with geographic forwarding to
implement unicast.
Rybicki et al. [2] proposed a new paradigm to implement traﬃc information
systems, using an infrastructure-based P2P network consisting of vehicles. This
approach has several advantages over traditional VANET-based systems. In addition, it might also be possible for both VANET and P2P based systems to
coexist and complement each other. Wolfson et al. [7] proposed a novel search
algorithm called Rank-Based Broadcast (RBB) based on device proximity for
discovery of local resources in mobile P2P networks. Eriksson et al. [8] presented
Cabernet for delivering data to moving vehicles, which uses WiFi access points
encountered during drives for network connectivity and provides a beneﬁcial way
to use the WiFi networks from moving vehicles.

A Novel Mobile DHT
Preliminaries

Most ﬁle queries are for highly replicated objects in P2P networks [9]. However,
queries for rare objects are also substantial [10]. Both studies correctly reﬂect
diﬀerent aspects of the Zipﬁan distributions. The head of the Zipﬁan popularity distribution was shown in [9], and hence the query requests are measured
based on the objects that match the top 50 queries seen. On the contrary, [10]
focuses on the long tail of the distribution. Individual rare objects in the tail
may not be requested frequently. However, these queries represent a substantial
fraction of the workload, and are worth optimizing. The popularity distribution
of a ﬁle-sharing workload is ﬂatter than what we would expect from a Zipﬁan
distribution [11]. Therefore, both frequent and rare objects are important for
retrieval.
3.2

Region Partition

For an administrative region covered by a mobile P2P network, we divide it into
a number of subregions based on system requirements in a recursive manner
for maintenance. The region is ﬁrst divided into two half subregions (Re and
Rw ) based on the north/south direction (i.e. longitude), where Re and Rw are
respectively represented by 1 and 0; and then for Re and Rw , they are also
divided into two half subregions (Rn and Rs ) based on the east/west direction
(i.e. latitude), where Rn and Rs are respectively represented by 1 and 0 as
well. The above procedure that is shown in Fig. 1 is recursively processed until
the diﬀerences in longitude and latitude of a subregion are both less than given
thresholds LO and LA. Consequently, the whole administrative region is divided
into multiple geographical subregions, which form the network topology. Each
subregion is represented by a unique region ID, and each peer uses this embedded
service to keep the location information of all subregions in the whole network.
Since the network topology consists of geographical subregions, each subregion
is responsible for a set of keys of data objects. The keys of data objects are
distributed among the subregions, such that each key is mapped to a subregion
R. This key-to-subregion mapping is known to all peers by using a variety of
Kademlia [3] named Mobile Kademlia (MKad). Note that the key-to-subregion
mapping is used in MKad, while the key-to-peer mapping is utilized in the
original Kademlia.
In MKad, each subregion has a unique ID and each key is a 160-bit identiﬁer.
Every document is associated with a home subregion, where the document is
initially stored. To assign key, value pairs to particular subregions, MKad relies
on a notion of distance between a subregion ID and a key identiﬁer, where key
is a 160-bit identiﬁer of a word or document and value is a word or document
itself. Given a subregion ID R and a key, MKad deﬁnes the distance between
them as their bitwise exclusive or (XOR) interpreted as an integer, d(R, key) =
R key. Since XOR is unidirectional, it ensures that all lookups for the same
key converge along the same path, regardless of the originating peer. Thus,
caching key, value pairs along the lookup path alleviates the load of hot spots.
In MKad, there are four subregions with respect to a object: query subregion,

3.3

Aggregation for a Word

To obtain the aggregation for a word w in a subregion, there are two possible
approaches. One is gossip-based approach, where peers exchange their current
aggregates with their neighbors till the aggregates almost converge to the global
values; the other is hierarchy-based approach, where peers come into being a
hierarchy and pass the aggregates in a bottom-up manner along the hierarchical
path. Hierarchy-based approach requires a super peer mechanism, which is hard
to be implemented in mobile P2P networks. Therefore, we utilize gossip-based
approach to obtain w’s aggregation.
When a peer is moving out of a subregion, its aggregation results and cached
documents are transferred to some peers within the subregion which have the following features: 1) low mobility speed; 2) close to the center of the subregion, or
moving towards the center; 3) enough cache space. A peer with low mobility and
locating near the subregion’s center is probably selected to store the aggregates,
since it will leave the subregion in the near future with a low probability. In our
proposed scheme, gossip-based aggregation has two functions: identifying rare
words and publishing new words into MKad. We also diﬀerentiate mobile peers
by their movements, which could be intra-subregion movement or inter-subregion
movement. For an intra-subregion movement, a peer moves only within the same
subregion, thus the overheads are trivial. For an inter-subregion movement, on
the contrary, a peer moves out of its initial subregion to a neighboring subregion. Peers need to check their positions periodically to detect an inter-subregion
movement.
3.4

MKad Network Maintenance

For each peer in mobile P2P networks, its storage space is limited and thus it
is not able to store excessive objects. On the other hand, it is also expensive

308

Q. Xu et al.

to maintain too many popular objects in the MKad network due to the limited
bandwidth. Popular objects are expected to be dropped from the MKad network
if they can be easily and quickly found by ﬂooding-based techniques. Here we
use gossip-based aggregation to decide if a word is popular or rare. We present
an algorithm shown in Algorithm 1 for maintaining the MKad network. For new
words, they are often rare. Thus they are published in the MKad network (lines
2-4). Given a word, if its number of request is not less than Θth where Θth is a
threshold, the word is regarded as a popular one. Then, the indexes of popular
words are dropped from the MKad network (lines 5-9).

Hybrid Retrieval

For information retrieval in mobile P2P networks, generally two search schemes
can be applied: ﬂooding-based scheme and DHT-based scheme. We ﬁrst present
their cost models, followed by the hybrid retrieval algorithm which can automatically select the more eﬃcient scheme for a query word.
For the ﬂooding-based scheme, the total expected search cost for a query word
N
w is given in [12]: M u (w) = i=1 Cui P r(X > ui−1 ), where a search strategy
with TTL values u = [u1 , u2 , · · · , uN ], X is the object w’s location, Cui is the
search cost of with TTL value ui , and u0 = 0 is assumed. Cui was mentioned
in [13] that the number of messages incurred with a TTL value of ui is roughly
ui + βui 2 , where β is a constant with respect to the network parameters. The
search policy that minimizes this cost reads as following:
N

∗

F (w) = M u (w) = arg min
u∈U

Cui P r(X > ui−1 )

(1)

i=1

where U denotes the set of all admissible search strategies (TTL sequences), i.e.,
all vectors u such that ui < ui+1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. Formula 1 can be solved
backward in time using standard dynamic programming techniques [12].
For DHT-based scheme, the search cost can be approximately modeled as
below:
D(w) =

Rw − Ro
+
γ

Ri ∈R

Ri − Ro
y(Ri , w)
γ

(2)

where Ro is the originating subregion for the query w, Rw is the subregion that
is responsible for the index of w according to MKad, y(Ri , w) is the boolean
function returns 1 if Ri publishes w, or 0 otherwise, γ is the transmission range,
and . represents the distance between two subregions.
Based on a simple ﬂooding algorithm presented in Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3
outlines our method - HybridRetrieval. When a peer sends a query q which
may contain multiple words, the peer generates a query message containing the
following two ﬁelds: 1) its identity, and 2) the set of query words. If the search cost
of ﬂooding-based scheme is not greater than that of DHT-based scheme (line 5),
it ﬂoods the query with a given TTL L to determine if any of its neighbors have
query answers (line 5). If not, the requesting peer can use the MKad protocol

to get a subregion (Rkey ) of query word according to the query (line 7). The
home subregion of w is determined by searching the subregion whose region ID
is the closest to the key of w. Peers that locate outside the home subregion drop
the query message without further processing. Flooding is restricted within a
subregion for quick query response and savings in network bandwidth (line 10).
A peer that routes the query message towards the destination subregion checks
its location in the message’s header to determine if it is within that subregion.
The ﬁrst peer that receives the query message inside the destination subregion
ﬂoods the message within the subregion to locate the peers holding the documents including the requested key words. Each peer in that subregion processes
the query message to determine if it has the requested documents. When the
documents are located, the response is sent back to the original requesting peer
and the query process expires.

Experimental Studies
Experimental Setup

For the simulations, a discrete event simulator NS-2 (http://www.isi.edu/nsnam
/ns/ ) is employed with the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer. The NS-2 simulation model
simulates peers moving in an unobstructed plane. GPSR [14] is used as the
wireless routing protocol. We have modiﬁed it to provide routing to subregions
instead of speciﬁc destinations by forwarding the packet towards the subregion
and using the ﬂooding-based scheme inside the subregion.
To measure the performance of our search schemes, we simulate the algorithms
on various mobile network topologies by varying the number of peers from 100 to
1000, mean speeds from 1 to 20 m/s, and motion regions from 1500m × 1500m
to 4000m × 4000m. The default parameters: # of peers is 400, # of document
objects is 10,000, transmission range of a peer is 250m, motion region is 2000m
× 2000m, mean speed is 10m/s, length or width of a region is 250m.
5.2

Data Set

We utilize TREC data from the 2GB Web track (WT2G) to simulate documents
(ads or traﬃc information), and their associated words as their descriptive tags.

310

Q. Xu et al.

The top n words within each document are associated with the tags that are
valid in describing the document. The words used to describe a document are
drawn from its corresponding Web document. It makes the simulations more
realistic. We use word frequency to simulate the strength of description that a
word has in a document. The relative popularities of documents are arbitrarily
assigned according to a Zipf distribution.
5.3

Retrieval Models

A series of experiments are conducted to study several combinations of routing
query messages and search in mobile P2P networks. In our experiments, we used
simulations to evaluate HR and compared its performance to three other search
models in vehicle-based mobile P2P networks. The same partition service of a
region is utilized in the four models, which is known to all participating peers.
The four search models read as follows: 1) Flooding: Search using the
ﬂooding-based scheme alone. 2) GLS+MKad: Grid Location Service (GLS) [6]
builds an ad hoc network’s area by using a ﬁxed grid. Each peer maintains 1and 2-hop neighbor lists. The neighbor lists are built from piggyback messages
and indicate a peer’s location as well as other parameters like the peer’s 1-hop
neighbors. In addition, an appropriate cell size is carefully selected regarding
the transmission range of the peers. Each peer in a cell knows about all other
peers in the same cell. 3) HLS+MKad: Hierarchical Location Service (HLS) [5]
divides the area of a mobile network into smaller areas called cells and assign
each peer a set S of these cells. Position updates and requests are sent to (possibly diﬀerent) subsets of S. The selection of the subset depends on a hierarchical
grouping of the cells of S and the position of the peer which computes the subset. The intersection of two subsets computed for the same peer is non-empty
in HLS. 4) HR: All the subregions construct the MKad network. HR chooses
either ﬂooding-based scheme or DHT-based scheme for eﬃcient indexing and
searching by analyzing their expected search cost according to cost functions in
mobile P2P networks.
GLS and HLS are both position-based routing approaches and do not support
search in mobile P2P networks. Thus, we integrate the MKad function into them
and use it to get the relevant peers for a given query. Furthermore, GLS and
HLS are utilized to route between a response peer and a requesting peer.
5.4

Evaluation Methodology

We adopt three performance metrics to evaluate retrieval in mobile P2P networks, i.e., retrieval accuracy, query latency and query routing eﬃciency.
Recall For automatically-generated queries, it is expensive for us to acquire
relevance judgments in mobile P2P networks. Instead, we used the retrieval
results from a single large collection as the baseline, whereafter measuring how
well the P2P network could reproduce this baseline. The single large collection
is the subset of the experimental test data set used to deﬁne peer contents, and
agreement is measured over all the data retrieved for each query. Although this
methodology is not perfect, it is reasonable because distributed retrieval systems
are not better than the “single collection” baseline. Accuracy is measured with

Query Routing Eﬃciency. Query routing eﬃciency is usually measured by
the average number of query messages routed for each query in mobile P2P
networks.
5.5

Experimental Results and Analysis

Experiment 1: Eﬀect of Peer Densities We consider the eﬀects of peer densities on query recall, latency and routing eﬃciency of diﬀerent methods. Fig. 2(a),
2(b) and 2(c) show that HR yields the best performance on query recall, latency
and routing eﬃciency. HR uses the proposed utility functions and carefully selects query techniques: ﬂooding and MKad, which can signiﬁcantly improve the
three metrics when the query is initialized and forwarded between peers. HR
uses the ﬂooding-based technique to search popular words and uses GPSR to
return retrieval results. On the other hand, HR uses MKad to locate rare words
and uses the ﬂooding-based scheme to ﬁnd them only in single subregions.
However, GLS and HLS only use MKad to locate words. In the static P2P
networks, the query recall of DHT techniques is relatively high. However, the
performance drops greatly because mobile P2P networks are highly dynamic. On
the other hand, GLS and HLS achieve a much worse query performance than HR
because they produce much more update packets leading to higher network load
and network congestion in the end. Moreover, there is a tradeoﬀ between the
maintenance cost for the MKad network and the query eﬀectiveness regarding
GLS and HLS.
Obviously, the ﬂooding-based technique is the worst on three metrics among
the four approaches because of three general reasons: 1) it is ineﬀective and
ineﬃcient to return the query answers; 2) it is less eﬀective for locating rare
items: 28.1% of all queries receive 5 or fewer results, and 12.3% of queries receive
no results in this experiment, although it is highly eﬀective for locating popular
words, which are retrieved in large quantities. On the other hand, although it is

highly eﬃcient for locating popular words, where the queries have good lookup
time, it has bad returning time; 3) it is less eﬃcient for locating rare objects
and the results have poor response time. For queries that return a single result,
the ﬁrst result arrives after 7.2 seconds on average. For queries that return 5 or
fewer results, 5.6 seconds elapsed on average before receiving the ﬁrst result in
this experiment. However, HR uses the designed utility functions to select the
query techniques for improving the query recall, latency and routing eﬃciency.
As the peer density increases, HR can construct stabler MKad network to search
rare words and locate much more popular words with smaller TTL.
Experiment 2: Eﬀect of Mobility Speeds To evaluate the scalability of HR
with respect to mobility speeds, we increase the mobility speeds from 1m/s to
20m/s. We still evaluate three metrics: query recall, latency and routing eﬃciency
of four approaches. The results presented in Fig. 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) indicate that
HR still achieves signiﬁcantly better query performance than the other three
methods.
It is more diﬃcult for the ﬂooding-based mechanism to locate rare words
and return retrieval results at higher speed. The network load in GLS and HLS
increases with growing peer speed because more updates are sent that lead to
worse query routing eﬃciency. On the other hand, a higher load produces more
collisions resulting in re-queries and in unwanted delays in GLS and HLS. Facing
to high peer speed, HR still has better query performance than the other three
methods because it is based on subregions besides the proposed cost functions.
On the other hand, HR construct the MKad network only for rare objects, which
is eﬀective and eﬃcient at high speed. On the contrary, both GLS and HLS are
not eﬀective and eﬃcient to construct the MKad network for all the objects at
high speed.
Experiment 3: Eﬀect of Motion Regions with a Fixed Peer Density
We consider the eﬀect of motion regions with a ﬁxed peer density (100 peers
per square kilometer) on query performance of four methods. Fig. 4(a), 4(b) and
4(c) show the results of query recall, latency and routing eﬃciency. Similarly,
HR can retrieve signiﬁcantly better query performance than previously proposed
methods. Clearly, the ﬂooding method is the worst among the four approaches,
which does not need to be elaborated any further.
To improve the query performance, the proposed utility functions in HR help
to carefully select query techniques: ﬂooding and MKad. Moreover, HR uses

GPSR to locate response peers and return query results to a requesting peer.
Since GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions using the only information about
a router’s immediate neighbors, both query latency and query eﬃciency are improved further. However, GLS and HLS only use MKad to locate words. Besides
previous explanations in experiment 1 and 2, their query messages in a larger
region must be forwarded to requesting peers and response ones via a longer distance, which is a more diﬃcult task in mobile P2P networks with fast movers.

Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we gave two scenarios to motivate our research on search in mobile
P2P networks. And then we proposed hybrid retrieval policies to utilize ﬂoodingbased and MKad-based schemes for quick search in mobile P2P networks. Our
experiments show our approach yields better performance. In particular, the
query response time and the number of messages per query are reduced substantially without losing accuracy. We believe that possible directions to future
work include some research topics such as extending our method with cooperative cache in mobile P2P networks, evaluating the MKad network’s performance
and maintenance cost, improving the simple ﬂooding algorithm, and examining
the impact of diverse duplication mechanisms in our retrieval model.
