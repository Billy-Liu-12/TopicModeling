Abstract. In the present article, we use the density matrix evolution method to
study the effect of a model solvent on the vibrational spectrum of a diatomic
solute particle. The effect of the solvent is considered as a perturbation on the
Hamiltonian of the quantum subsystem consisting of a harmonic oscillator. The
bath particles are treated classically. The perturbation potential representing
the interaction between the solute and the solvent is represented in a biexponential form. This provides an effective way to evaluate the required matrix elements needed to compute the evolution of the density matrix. The model
calculations indicate that the repulsive parts of the potential dominate causing
blue shifts in the vibrational frequencies.
Keywords: Density matrix evolution, vibrational spectrum, quantum harmonic
oscillator, bi-exponential perturbation potential, Hellmann-Feynman force,
Runge Kutta method, molecular dynamics, bath particles.

1 Introduction
A study of the effects of solvents on the electronic and vibrational structure and
dynamics of molecules has interested chemists for a long time. In recent years, the
effect of solvation dynamics on the dynamical behaviour of molecules has been
studied experimentally as well as theoretically. In theoretical approaches, one often
separates the small molecular system from the bulk or the solvent and is able to treat
the two subsystems using methods most appropriate to represent the physical conditions. It is very common to treat the molecular system quantum mechanically and the
solvent classically and suitably treat the interaction between the two [1-5]. Several
approaches have been used to address the problem, such as the wave packet propagation method, the Car Parrinello method, the path integral method and the density
matrix evolution (DME) method. While each method has its advantages, we use
the density matrix evolution method in the present work. Our specific interest is in
the effect of the solvent structure on vibrational spectrum of a diatomic oscillator.
The red and blue shifts in the spectrum have been of significant interest for quite
some time [6, 7]. An effective numerical method to obtain the time dependence of
the density matrix has been developed by Berendsen and coworkers [8-10]. The
method is outlined in the next section. The results are presented in Section 3 followed by conclusions in section 4.

2 The DME Method and the Model Potential
In the DME method, the Liouville-von Neumann equation for the density matrix is
numerically solved to obtain the elements of the density matrix as a function of time.
The time-dependent wavefunction of the quantum sub-system is expanded in terms
of a suitably chosen orthogonal set of M basis functions φn .
M

Ψ (ξ , t ) = ∑ cn (t ) φn (ξ )

(1)

n =1

The coordinates of the quantum subsystem are denoted by ξ and the time evolution
of the system is studied in terms of the time dependent coefficients cn(t). In Equation
(1), M is the number of basis functions of the harmonic oscillator and we have taken
the first 5 harmonic oscillator wavefunctions in our study. The elements of the M X M
hermitian density matrix ρ nm are defined by

ρ nm = cn cm*

(2)

The diagonal elements of the density matrix give the populations of the levels and
the off diagonal elements contain the phase information. The Liouville- von Neumann
equation for the density matrix is given by

dρ i
= (ρ H − H ρ )
dt =

(3)
0

In the absence of the solvent, the Hamiltonian is H . The presence of the solvent
perturbs the system and the perturbed Hamiltonian is given by

H = H 0 + H′

(4)

The unperturbed matrix elements can be evaluated analytically while the perturbed
matrix elements have to be evaluated by appropriate expansion of the potential. The
'
effect of the solvent particles on the quantum subsystem is incorporated through H in
Equation (4). The total matrix element is obtained by summing over all the N particles of the solvent.
N

H n′ ,m = ∑ 〈 n |H i′ | m〉

(5)

i =1

Here, H i′ represents the interaction between the i th classical particle and the quantum subsystem [8-10].
The dynamics of the solvent is governed by the classical equations of motion and
the quantum subsystem contributes an additional term to the forces on the solvent
particles through the Hellmann-Feynman force [11] term which is given by

Fnm,u = 〈 n | −

∂H
| m〉

where u represents the directions x, y and z respectively. The total force acting on the
classical particle due to the quantum subsystem

FuQ is

FuQ = Tr ( ρ Fu )

(7)

Here, Tr represents the trace. Similarly, the vibrational energy of the quantum subsystem is given by

E Q = Tr ( ρ H )

(8)

The total force on the classical particle is given by

Fu = FuQ − ∑

For the quantum subsystem, we choose a harmonic oscillator with the potential,

V (ξ ) =

(10)

where ξ = x1 − x2 .
The oscillator is kept fixed on the x axis with the two particles of the oscillator located at x1 and x2 respectively and is surrounded by an atomic solvent wherein the
particles interact via a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential.

(11)

The interaction between the solvent particles and the atoms constituting the oscillator are represented by a bi-exponential function

V (r ) = A e − b r + Ce − d r

(12)

The values of A, b, C and d and the graph of the above two potentials are given
below. This is necessary because, if we use the LJ potential in Equation (6), the
matrix elements will diverge since the integration in Equation (6) includes the small
values of r as r goes to zero. The matrix elements for the force in Equation (6) are
obtaining by expanding the perturbation potential V (r) in terms of the vibrational
coordinate ξ and the coefficients which depend on the distance between the location
of the oscillator atoms and the solvent particles [8-10]. The integrations of the
equations of motion for the density matrix are done by using the fourth order
Runge Kutta method [12].

3 Results and Discussion
We treat the quantum subsystem as a diatomic oscillator oscillating with the frequency of Cl2. The two chlorine atoms are placed on the x-axis of a periodic box of
length 16 Ǻ containing solvent particles interacting with an LJ potential with σ = 3.4
Ǻ and ε / k = 120 K. The Cl atoms and the solvent particles also interact with a similar

potential, except that this potential is expressed in the form of Eq. (12) with the pa10
rameters A = 1.8025 x 10 J/mol, b = 5.0081 Ǻ, C = - 25875.225 J/mol and d =
0.8513 Ǻ which preserve the important features of the LJ potential given in (11).

The expectation value of ξ is calculated at each time step and its Fourier transform
of this expectation value is obtained to obtain the vibrational frequency in the solvent.
The production runs extend up to 100 ps with a time step of 0.1fs. We also compute
the solute solvent and the solvent solvent radial distribution functions, but these are
not reported here as our main interest is in the frequency shifts of the diatomic. The
frequencies at various densities of the solvent are given in Table 1. Higher solvent
temperatures are chosen so that during the simulations, different elements of the density matrix get significantly populated. At room temperature, the populations of all the
elements of the density matrix except ρ00 and ρ11 do not develop significant populations [13, 14].

4 Conclusions
We have calculated in the present article the vibrational frequencies of a diatomic in
the presence of a model solvent at various densities. The method used herein implies
an implicit separation between the vibrational motion of the oscillator and the translational motion of the solvent. The model LJ potential between the solvent and the
atoms of the oscillator was written as a sum of two exponentials so that the matrix
elements required to evaluate the time evolution could be easily computed. We observe that in our simulations at various solvent densities, there is a predominant blue
shift in the oscillator frequencies. As has been observed by several earlier investigators, the major components that contribute to the frequency shifts are the attractive
and repulsive parts of the potential, the solvent density and the changes in the equilibrium bond length of the oscillator as a function of solvent density. In earlier calculations [6, 7], red shifts have been observed at low densities of the solvent. At higher
densities, there was a blue shift in the spectrum. We observe that when the potential
well is made deeper by increasing the well depth, there are red shifts in the spectrum
in the low density regions. When the frequency of the oscillator was increased (to
represent molecules such as N2), the solvent effects on the oscillator frequency are
larger. Red shifts also appear at lower solvent densities. We think that it should be
possible to obtain the full density dependence of the vibrational spectrum without
using a model potential in which the equilibrium bond length of the quantum oscillator is density dependent [6]. Work is in progress in this direction.
