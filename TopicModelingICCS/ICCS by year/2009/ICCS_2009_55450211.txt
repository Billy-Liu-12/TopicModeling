Abstract. Photochromic compounds exhibit reversible transition between
closed and open isomeric forms upon irradiation accompanied by change in
their color. The two isomeric forms differ not only in absorption spectra, but
also in various physical and chemical properties and find applications as optical
switching and data storage materials. In this contribution we apply Density
Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to predict the
equilibrium geometry and absorption spectra of a benchmark set of diarylethene
based photochromic compounds in open and closed forms (before and after
photocyclization). Comparison of the calculated Bond Length Alternation
parameters with those available from the X-ray data indicates M05-2x
functional to be the best method for geometry optimization when basis set
includes polarization functions. We found M05 functional accurately predicts
the maximum absorption wavelength when solvent is taken into account. We
recommend combined theory level TD-M05/6-31G*/PCM//M05-2x/631G*/PCM for prediction of geometrical and spectral parameters of diarylethene derivatives.
Keywords: photochromism, density functional theory, electronic spectra, bond
length alternation, molecular structure.

1 Introduction
Photochromism is light-induced reversible molecular transition between two isomers,
closed and open, with different absorption spectra. Apart from the color, the two
isomers also differ in various physical and chemical properties such as refractive indices, dielectric constants, oxidation-reduction potentials and geometrical structures.
The instant property changes upon photoirradiation can be used in various optoelectronic devices such as optical memory, optical switching, displays and nonlinear optics. Irie and Lehn [1-9] were among the first authors to investigate diarylethenes as a
potential candidate for photochromic applications (Fig.1).
In the case of photochromic diarylethenes, the open form has twisted π-system and is
colorless while the closed form with nearly planar π-system is conjugated and colored.

Thus, the ground state geometry is essential to predict their characteristic properties. An
important geometrical parameter in the conjugated systems is the bond-length alternation (BLA), defined as the difference between the single and double bond lengths. For
linear chain oligomers it has been known that the band gap, nonlinear optical (NLO)
properties, excited states, etc. are BLA-dependent [10-15].

The theoretical predictions of BLA for several series of conjugated oligomers has
been conducted by Jacquemin and co-workers [16-23] in the past decade. They performed ab initio calculations on mainly acyclic conjugated systems and concluded
that (1) MP2 values are in good agreement with higher-order electron-correlated
wavefunction approaches that include triple excitations; (2) basis set effects are relatively limited, and polarized double-ζ basis is sufficient, at least for DFT calculations;
(3) all conventional GGA and meta-GGA provide similar BLA, that are much too
small and too rapidly decreasing with the chain lengthens; (4) hybrid functionals correct this trends but to a small extend so that quantitative agreement with MP2 values
is still far away; (5) the conformation differences do not alter these three latter conclusions; (6) self-interaction corrections included via the averaged-density self-interaction
correction (ADSIC) scheme improves BLA evolution obtained by the conventional
DFT approaches. For medium-size oligomers ADSIC predicts BLA in better agreement
with MP2, than B3LYP or PBE0. However, diarylethene derivatives had not been investigated in that respect.
In the present contribution we report BLA using different DFT methods to
predict the ground state geometry for the open and closed isomers as well as for some
by-products. The methods are validated by comparison with the experimental X-ray
crystal structures available for some of diarylethene derivatives. Our goal is to establish the computational protocol to investigate structure-property relationships for the
diarylethene derivatives aimed to guide the design of new photochromics.
The distinctive absorption spectrum of the two isomeric forms of the photochromic
compounds is an essential property of investigation. Experimental absorption spectra
(λmax) of such compounds are determined in different solvents for different derivatives. Recently Jacquemin and co-workers evaluated the λmax for large set of perfluoro
derivatives of diarylethenes solvent conditions using Time-Dependent
Density Functional (TD-DFT) formalism [24]. However their data is limited for
closed isomers only. In the present paper, we have employed TD-DFT formalism to
predict the absorption spectra of a benchmark set of photochromic compounds for
both open and closed isomeric forms.

2 Computational Details
The calculations have been performed using GAUSSIAN03 package. Different levels
of theory were used to find the best method for geometry optimization, followed by
absorption spectra predictions. Complete optimizations have been performed on a
benchmark set of diarylethene photochromic compounds (Fig.2,a-d) to perform bond
length alternation (BLA) analysis and compared to the experimentally determined Xray geometries of a set of structures in order to validate a suitable method as well as
basis set for accurate geometry prediction.

The optimized structures were further used to predict the excitation spectrum of
each molecule with Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT) formalism. TD-DFT is a quantum mechanical method used to investigate the excited state proprieties of many-body
systems. It is important to note that out of several excited states only the one with the
maximal oscillator strength was used for comparison with experiment. Often that was

215

not the lowest excitation reported by TD-DFT. Several different functionals have been
tested to select the best method which can be used to determine the accurate absorption spectra for both isomeric forms of the different derivatives of diarylethenes. Solvent effects were included implicitly by means of non-equilibrium polarizable
continuum model (PCM), which uses empirical dielectric constants (both slow orientational and fast electronic components) as well as atomic radii as model parameters.
PCM typically provides a good approximation of solvent effects as long as specific
interaction with the solvent (such as hydrogen bonds) can be neglected.
The solvents used for the current work were chosen to reproduce the experimental
results as close as possible. Heptane (Hep) was used for the compounds whose experimental data was available in hexane while Benzene (Bz), Dicholomethane (DCM)
and Acetonitrile (ACN) was used for those compounds whose experimental data was
available in the same solvent.

M05, and M05-2x. The results of these calculations (which will be published elsewhere) suggest that the M05-2x functional that includes 52% fraction of the HartreeFock exchange, gives the best agreement with the experimental BLA values. We also
compared the maxima on the absorption spectra, evaluated using TD-DFT formalism
with the same selection of exchange-correlation potentials using implicit solvent
model for both closed and open isomers. We found that M05 method agrees with the
experimental λmax values the best. Polarizable continuum model and double-ζ basis set

with polarization functions were important to obtain the accurate equilibrium geometry as well as absorption spectra. The comparison of the calculated and experimental
BLA parameters and absorption wavelengths for the benchmark subset of diarylethene photochromic compounds is reported in Table 1.
For the rest of the molecules in the benchmark set single crystal X-ray diffraction
data were not available. We report their maximum absorption wavelengths at two
theory levels: TD-M05/6-31G*/PCM and TD-B3LYP/6-31G*/PCM (with geometry
optimized at M052x/6-31G*/PCM level) and compare our predictions with the experimental λmax values in Table 2. Looking at the RMSD values reported in the last
row of that table one can see that B3LYP functional predicts the wavelengths three
times closer to experimental values for the closed ring isomers with extended conjugation lengths, than for the open ring isomers. Other functionals, such as BMK, exhibit an opposite trends. The M05 functional seems to be the best compromise, with
the average errors of 4-7 nm.

4 Conclusions
Several exchange-correlation functionals in combination with TD-DFT formalism were
evaluated for predictions of the absorption spectra for both closed and open isomers of
diarylethene photochromic compounds. Bond length alternation descriptors were
employed to select suitable DFT methods to predict equilibrium geometry in these compounds. We found that a) the most accurate equilibrium geometry based on BLA parameter is best calculated at M05-2x/6-31G*/PCM level; b) TD-DFT spectral data is best
reproduced at M05/6-31G*/PCM level with the average deviation form the observed
values in the range of 3-7 nm; c) use of polarization functions in the basis set is important
to obtain the best geometry; d) solvent effects as described by polarizable continuum
model (PCM) are important for the accurate predictions of the spectral data with TDDFT. We recommend theory level TD-M05/6-31G*/PCM//M052x/6-31G*/PCM for
prediction of geometrical and spectral parameters (BLA and the λmax values) for both
closed and open isomers of diarylethene derivatives. This opens a possibility to establish
structure-property relationship for diarylethene photochromics to assist in rational design
of improved materials for photoswitching and data storage applications.
