Abstract. In this paper we present the results of a numerical simulation of the
dynamics of a periodically forced spherical particle in a quiescent Newtonian
fluid at low Reynolds number. We describe the simulation and tests performed
to validate our simulation. We have obtained results which are physically
reasonable and hence we have confidence in our results. We include the effects
of both convective and unsteady inertia on the dynamics at low Reynolds
numbers. The inclusion of inertia results in additional linear and nonlinear
terms in the equations representing a fading memory of the entire history of the
motion. The nonlinearity though small in the parametric regime of interest,
gives rise to some interesting features in the solution of the problem.
Keywords: Low Reynolds numbers, quiescent fluid, spherical particle, periodic
force.

1 Introduction
The motion of a spherical particle in a fluid at low Reynolds numbers has been of
appreciable interest for more than a century, starting with Stokes [1], and his interest
on the effects of fluid friction on the motion of pendulums and hence in accurate time
keeping. His fundamental expression for the force acting on a spherical particle has
motivated many researchers to obtain better approximations for the hydrodynamic
force acting on spherical particles. Lovalenti and Brady [2] have summarized work
prior to 1993 in their paper and have also derived an expression for the hydrodynamic
force undergoing arbitrary time-dependent motion at small Reynolds numbers. In this
paper we use the expression derived by Lovalenti and Brady [2] for the hydrodynamic
force on a rigid spherical particle undergoing arbitrary time-dependent motion at low
Reynolds numbers, to obtain expressions for the particle displacement and particle
velocity of a periodically forced spherical particle in a quiescent Newtonian fluid at
low Reynolds numbers.

Our work is motivated by the prior work of Ramamohan and coworkers on the
dynamics of periodically forced particles at zero Reynolds numbers i.e., by complete
neglect of both unsteady and convective inertia. Kumar and Ramamohan [3] have
shown that rheological parameters of suspensions can be controlled using periodic
perturbations and that small changes in controllable parameters lead to large changes
in rheology. In the present work, our interest is in studying periodically forced
suspensions at low Reynolds numbers. The present system is one of the simplest
experimentally realizable fluid dynamical systems, at low Reynolds numbers, which
can atleast in principle show nonlinear behavior. Further this is an ideal system to
investigate fundamental questions about the average behavior of periodically forced
systems of nonlinear oscillators and the relationship of the dynamics of a single
oscillator to the dynamics of the average behavior of a large number of such
oscillators. Here we note that the periodic forcing occurs both at the individual
particle level as well as at the level of the averages [4]. This provides a nonlinear
coupling between the microlevel of the individual particle and the macrolevel of its
averages. In this work we take the first step in the direction of analyzing this problem
by determining the effects of a periodic force on the dynamics of a neutrally buoyant
spherical particle in a quiescent incompressible Newtonian fluid at low but nonzero
Reynolds numbers. This is the simplest possible extension including inertia to the
problem studied for over a decade by Ramamohan and coworkers and summarized in
Asokan et al. [5]. The inclusion of inertia results in a delay between the variation of
the external force and the variation in the response of the particle to the external force.
The expression for the hydrodynamic force FH on a spherical particle undergoing an
arbitrary motion in an arbitrary time dependent uniform flow field, given by Lovalenti
and Brady [2] is used to derive the expression for the particle velocity and
displacement using Newton’s law and the results are validated by performing several
tests on the software. We have generated a number of phase plots (plots between
particle displacement and particle velocity) and displacement time series and velocity
time series from our simulation. We have analyzed these phase plots and time series
using the TISEAN software package, Hegger et al, [6] for nonlinear behavior.

For our problem, we consider a neutrally buoyant sphere in an infinite body of a
quiescent fluid and consider the effects of an external periodic force acting on the
sphere along the x – axis. We use equation (1) to obtain the equation governing the
unidirectional motion of a sphere in a quiescent fluid, starting with zero velocity at
time t = 0, with Us = Up where Up is the velocity of the particle, scaled with respect to
the size of the particle and the frequency of the external periodic force, ω and

U ∞ = 0 . Under these conditions, equation (1) reduces to

3 Methodology
We developed software using Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN [7] to solve equations
(5a) and (5b) using an embedded Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step size. The
integral in the equation (5b) was evaluated at each time step by Romberg
extrapolation. The function with respect to ‘A’ was defined by a user supplied
function subprogram. We used the ODEINT, RKQS, RKCK subroutines from
Numerical Recipes [7] to implement the Runge – Kutta method. The Romberg
extrapolation was performed using the QROMB subroutine. The integral was
evaluated using TRAPZD and the interpolation during the numerical quadrature was
performed by POLINT. The tolerance for both the Romberg extrapolation and the
Runge - Kutta solver was taken as 10-5. Further reduction of the tolerance did not
result in any significant change in our results. The entire program was written in
double precision. The initial conditions for both the velocity and the position of the
particle were taken as zero. ε was taken as 0.04; smaller values of ε did not
significantly change the results. The software was tested for consistency by compiling
the program with two compilers namely, Intel Fortran and F90. We generated 5,000
data points taken at an interval of π/200 in both the dimensionless velocity and
dimensionless position. We note that there are certain novel features of these
equations, namely a nonlinear history term that results in certain special features in
the solutions.
The results of both the programs matched except for minor differences of the order
of 10-5. In addition to this, we performed the following tests to check the validity of
our results.

596

T.R. Ramamohan, I.S. Shivakumara, and K. Madhukar

TEST1: We performed a perturbation analysis of the problem, using Re1/2 as the
perturbation parameter. The particle displacement and particle velocity matched with
our numerical solutions upto Re ≈ 0.05. The deviation from the perturbation solution
may be due to the fact that even though Re is small, ‘A’ in equation (4), need not be
small for all ‘t’ and ‘s’. This test is an important test on our software as it showed that
the numerical solutions obtained by our software are correct.
TEST2: The solution of the problem of the motion of a spherical particle of greater
density than the fluid starting from rest derived using the assumptions of Reynolds
number Re<<1 and Strouhal number Sl known from the literature ( Fig. 5. of
Lovalenti and Brady [2] ) was reproduced.
TEST3: We assumed that the velocity of the fluid at infinity was a constant i.e.,
U ∞ = U 0 and we set ReF = 0. Under these assumptions, we obtained U p → U 0 as
t → ∞ , which is as expected.

TEST4: We generated a number of outputs using
compared the results as
and

U 0 = 0 and U 0 ≠ 0 and

U 0 → 0 . We found that the results matched for U 0 = 0

U 0 → 0 , up to an order of 10-5.

TEST5: When we change the initial direction of the motion, namely replacing ReF by
- ReF, the phase space plot is reflected about the zero velocity axis. That is, we obtain
the reflection of the phase space attractor about the zero velocity axis when the
direction of the first motion is reversed. We consider this as an important result which
demonstrates the correctness of our results. Our results show a preferred direction in
the solution. Since the only physical direction in our problem is the initial direction of
the external force, a reversal of that direction should result in a reversal of direction in
the solution. We find that this is indeed the case.
TEST6: We observed that there is a shift of position of the attractors when we change
the initial condition of Yp. Changing Yp at t = 0, results only in a shift of attractors as
there is only a change in the frame of reference, which does not affect the physics of
the problem. This confirms the fact that a change in the initial position only results in
a change in coordinate system and not in any physical parameter. This further
increases our confidence in our results.
We note here that, Up ≠ 0 at t = 0, does not make any physical sense, since if we
consider Up ≠ 0 at t = 0, then there must be some particle velocity at negative time
too. Moreover, in a quiescent fluid, the particle velocity is due to the application of
the external periodic force which is applied only from t = 0.
These tests give us considerable confidence in our simuation.

4 Results and Discussions
Typical phase space plots (plots of particle velocity versus particle position) are
plotted in Fig. 1. for different values of Re and ReF. We note that these plots represent
a bounded region of phase space and hence the plots represent an attractor in phase
space. We observe that here, as ReF increases the attractor size also increases,

establishing the obvious relation between the amplitude ReF of the forcing term and
the size of the attractors. As the amplitude of the periodic force increases, the particle
also oscillates with greater amplitude, covering a greater surface area in the attractor
plot. One can observe from the figure that as Re increases, the area bounded by
attractors decreases, showing the effect of inertia on the motion of the particle. We
can observe that for small ReF, especially for ReF = 0.01 and different Re, the
attractors are different from the other attractors shown in Fig. 1. We note here, that
near ReF = 0.01, there exists a bifurcation due to the occurrence of a band of higher
harmonics or quasi periodicity in the power spectrum and also the presence of kinks
at the two extremes of the phase plots as shown in Fig. 1. At low ReF, the nonlinearity
is comparatively large compared to the external periodic force. Re represents the
magnitude of the inertial term, namely a resistance to the change in motion. Hence as
Re increases, the resistance to the change in motion also increases diminishing the
size of the attractors.
The existence of higher harmonics or quasi periodicity is found in these regimes in
the power spectrum. We observe that the power spectrum plots are coherent with that
of the Stokes’ flow case, showing the effect of periodic force on the motion of the
particle dominating over the other parameters. However the phase plots in Fig. 1.
follow a small spiral, which is due to the presence of damping term in the expression
(5b). One can also note that there is a slight drift in the initial motion of the particle as
shown in Fig. 1. From this figure it is evident that there are kinks at the two extremes
in the phase space plots which occur around zero magnitudes of the velocity of the
particle and hence relatively inertial (nonlinear) effects, since near zero velocity, the
rate of change of the velocity is highest. On increasing the resolution of our
calculations and hence increasing the sampling frequency, these kinks do not change
showing the effects of nonlinear term dominating near ReF = 0.01. Typically, these
kinks increase in magnitude at large Re.
When we apply a phase shift of π to the sinusoidal forcing term the attractors shift
their direction. That is, when we apply a force in an initially negative direction (the
opposite direction) Yp shows a reflection about the Yp = 0 axis and thus we obtain a
reflection of the attractor. The reflection property of these attractors is evident upon
reversing the direction of first motion indicating that these features are not a
numerical artefact. Figure 2 show the phase plots when the direction of the amplitude
of the force is changed and the attractors form a reflection of each other about the axis
Yp = 0, as expected. Since the direction of the force represents the direction of initial
motion and also there is a fading memory, the particle shows an initial displacement
and at large times the periodic motion manifests itself, approximately.
We compared the results of the problem with the Stokes’ flow results. We have
considered the amplitude ratio as the ratio of the amplitude of the motion of the
particle in our problem with the Stokes’ flow amplitude. We note that except for ReF
= 0.01 and higher Re, the amplitude ratio with respect to Re and ReF shows a
decreasing trend. This might be due to the effect of inertia of the fluid. In the regime
of ReF = 0.01, we observe a greater dependence of the amplitude ratio on Re and ReF.
This is reasonable since we see a greater effect of nonlinearity in this region. We also
observe that as Re increases the amplitude ratio decreases, showing the effect of
inertia is to reduce the amplitude of the motion.

Fig. 1. The phase portrait for various Re and low ReF. These attractors show kinks at the two
extremes for ReF = 0.01, clearly showing the effect of the nonlinearity, namely a bifurcation
near ReF=0.01.

We observed that there is a definite relationship between the mean particle
displacement Yp,mean and the amplitude of the external periodic force ReF. This is as
expected since the magnitude of the initial motion is determined by the amplitude of
the periodic external force and by the value of Re. As Re increases we note that
Yp,mean decreases and as ReF increases Yp,mean increases.
We obtained the relationship between Re, ReF and amplitude of the velocity of the
particle. We observe that the amplitude of the velocity increases with increase in ReF
and decreases with increase in Re, describing the effect of the periodic force and

inertia and effect on the amplitude of the velocity of the particle. Using TISEAN [6],
we performed tests for the possibility of chaos in the system and found that there
occurs a bifurcation at low ReF and high Re, there is no chaos in the system.

Fig. 2. The phase portrait obtained at Re = 0.3 and ReF = ±0.1. The phase portrait shows the
reflection property of the solutions of our problem, indicating that there is a physical basis to
our results.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have attempted to determine the effects of a periodic force on a
sphere in a quiescent fluid at low Reynolds numbers. We observe that the particle
oscillates around a mean position, due to the periodic force on the particle. There is a
net displacement of the mean position of the particle in the direction of first motion.
The presence of higher harmonics in the full problem for small ReF and high Re are
noticed and this shows that though there is a nonlinear term in the equation, its effect
is small in the parametric regime which we have considered except at low values of
ReF and large values of Re. It is also observed that increasing Re was responsible for
an increase in the resistance to the change in particle motion and hence a decrease in
attractor area and increasing ReF leads to an increase in the amplitude of the motion of

the particle. Besides, a reflection of the attractor on changing the initial direction of
motion is obtained. Our results of the dependence of the mean position of the particle
and the amplitude of the velocity of a particle on the problem parameters, such as Re
and ReF may be used to estimate appropriate physical parameters of the system by
suitable experiments. We hope that this work will excite further interest in this area.
