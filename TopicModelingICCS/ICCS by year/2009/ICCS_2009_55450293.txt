Abstract. This paper introduces a three and a four order explicit time
stepping method. These methods have high stage order and favorable
monotonicity properties. The proposed methods are based on multistagemultistep (MM) schemes that belong to the broader class of general linear
methods, which are generalizations of both Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods. Methods with high stage order alleviate the order reduction occurring in explicit multistage methods due to non-homogeneous
boundary/source terms. Furthermore, the MM schemes presented in this
paper can be expressed as convex combinations of Euler steps. Consequently, they have the same monotonicity properties as the forward Euler
method. This property makes these schemes well suited for problems with
discontinuous solutions.

Introduction

The numerical solution of time-dependent partial diﬀerential equations and nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws are of great practical importance as they
model diverse physical phenomena that appear in engineering, aeronautics, astrophysics, meteorology oceanography, environmental sciences, etc. Representative examples for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws include gas dynamics,
shallow water ﬂow, ground-water ﬂow, non-Newtonian ﬂows, traﬃc ﬂows, advection and dispersion of contaminants, etc.
In the “method of lines” approach the temporal and spatial discretizations
are independent. Traditionally Runge-Kutta (RK) and linear multistep methods (LM)s have been used for the integration of ODEs and semi-discrete timedependent PDEs. General linear (GL) methods [1,2] represent a natural
generalization of both Runge-Kutta (RK) and linear multistep (LM) methods.
The methods investigated in this work are based on multistage-multistep (MM)
schemes that belong to the broader class of GL methods. Multistep-multistage
schemes are aimed at enhancing the stability and accuracy properties of the
classical RK and LM methods. They use both internal stages like RK methods
and information from previous solution steps like LM methods.
Explicit Runge-Kutta methods have stage order equal to one, and hence are
subject to order reduction in the presence of non-homogeneous boundary and
source terms [3,13,14]. The proposed high-stage order MM methods alleviate

this problem without loosing their explicit character. Moreover, they can be
expressed as convex combinations of Euler steps, and consequently, they have
the same monotonicity properties that the spatial discretization method has
with the forward Euler time stepping scheme, but with a diﬀerent time step
restriction [15,6]. This property makes the proposed MM schemes well suited for
problems with discontinuous solutions (e.g., hyperbolic problems). Furthermore,
the monotonicity properties can also guarantee the positivity of the solution.
In this study we investigate explicit time stepping methods of orders three
and four based on MM schemes. The proposed methods have high stage order
and favorable monotonicity properties. These features allow them to:
– avoid order reduction due to non-homogeneous boundary/source terms and
– prevent non-physical behavior with discontinuous solutions.
The proposed methods are aimed at modeling the transport components in atmospheric and oceanic simulations. The rest of this manuscript is organized
as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we present some background material on MM
schemes and the monotonicity property considered in this study. The two proposed methods are presented in Sec. 4. Numerical experiments that illustrate
the main features of the new methods are shown in Sec. 5. A short discussion
concludes the paper.

Problem Formulation and Monotonicity Considerations

In this work we are concerned with the numerical solution of nonlinear timedependent partial diﬀerential equations in the method of lines approach:
y (t) = f (t, y(t)) , t0 < t < tFinal , y(t0 ) = y0 ,

(1)

where f represents the discretization of the spatial variables forming a semidiscrete equation, continuous in time. System (1) is nonauthonomous, however,
for brevity we skip the time argument of f , unless noted otherwise.
We next introduce the concept of strong stability which deﬁnes the monotonicity properties that the proposed methods obey.
Definition 1 (Strong stability[12,6,15]). A sequence {y (n) } is said to be
strongly stable in a given semi-norm || · || if ||y (n+1) || ≤ ||y (n) || for all n ≥ 0.
Strong stability preserving (SSP) integrators are high order time stepping schemes
that preserve the stability properties of the spatial discretization used with explicit Euler time stepping. Spurious oscillations can occur in a numerical solution
that obeys the classical linear stability [6]. In PDEs with hyperbolic components
an appropriate spatial discretization combined with an SSP time stepping method
yields a numerical solution that does not exhibit nonlinear instabilities.
The favorable properties of SSP schemes derive from convexity arguments.
In particular, if the forward Euler method is strongly stable for any time step
smaller than ΔtFE (i.e., ||y + Δtf (y)|| ≤ ||y||, Δt ≤ ΔtFE ), then higher-order

Explicit Time Stepping Methods with High Stage Order

methods can be constructed as convex combinations of forward Euler steps with
various step sizes [15]. For example an explicit s-stage Runge-Kutta method can
be represented in Euler steps:

α(i,j) y[n−1] + β (i,j) ΔtF[n−1] ; i = 2, 3, . . . , s, s + 1 .

(2b)

j=1

SSP methods preserve the strong stability of the forward Euler scheme for
bounded time steps Δt ≤ C · ΔtFE , where C is referred to as the CFL coeﬃcient for the SSP property.
Theorem 1 (SSP for Runge-Kutta methods[6,15]). If the forward Euler
method is strongly stable under the CFL restriction Δt ≤ ΔtFE , then the RungeKutta method (2) with β (i,j) ≥ 0 is SSP provided that Δt ≤ CΔtFE , where
α(i,j) /β (i,j) : 1 ≤ i ≤ s, 1 ≤ j ≤ i − 1, β (i,j) = 0 .

C = Min

In order to compare methods with diﬀerent computational cost, a scaled or
eﬀective CFL coeﬃcient, denoted by C, is obtained by scaling the method’s CFL
with the number of right-hand-side evaluations.

Multistep Multistage Methods

We consider the following explicit k-step s-stage multistep-multistage method to
compute the numerical solution of (1) with time step Δt. The solution at step
n, y[n] ≈ y(tn ) = y(nΔt) is given by

and derivatives evaluated at previous steps, whereas the second sum describes

the internal stages of the current step evaluation. Each stage value y[n− ] is
an approximation to y (tn− + ci Δt). The abscissa, c, is determined from the
consistency conditions.

The linear stability of method (3) is analyzed on a linear scalar test problem:
y (t) = λy(t), λ ∈ C. By applying (3) to the test problem yields a solution of
form y n+1 = R(z) y n , where z = λΔt and R(z) is referred to as the stability
function of the method. Method (3) is linearly stable if |R(z)| ≤ 1. The linear
stability region is deﬁned as the set S = {z ∈ C : |R(z)| ≤ 1}.
We give the following result without proof.
Theorem 2 (SSP for MM methods). If the forward Euler method is strongly
(i,j)
stable under the CFL restriction Δt ≤ ΔtFE , then method (3) with β[n− ] ≥ 0 is
SSP provided that Δt ≤ CΔtFE , where

By using consistency and convexity arguments the above theorem reduces to
Theorem 1 and the proof is given in [6]. The importance of the SSP property is
illustrated in Fig. 2.a where non-physical oscillations develop in the solution.

method with two stages and four steps (s = 2, k = 4). The CFL coeﬃcient is
C=0.64 (C=0.32).

Linear Stability

The linear stability region for MM p3 q3 (4) is shown in Figure 1.a. We remark
that the stability region contains a segment of the imaginary axis, which is
a desirable property when solving PDEs via the method of lines with certain
spatial discretizations [9].
In Figure 1.b we show the stability region of MM p4 q3 (5), and here we
note again that the stability region contains a segment of the imaginary axis.
The region is smaller than in the case of (4); however, the fourth order method
requires only two function evaluation. It follows that MM p4 q3 has two thirds
of the cost of MM p3 q3.

In practice, for the proposed methods, one can easily compute the initial
solution and its derivative components with the classical SSP RK schemes [6,8]
of corresponding orders and at the respective times as given by the method
abscissa.

Numerical Results

In this section we present two numerical experiments that illustrate the properties of the two proposed MM methods. In the ﬁrst experiment we investigate the
SSP (monotonicity) properties. In the second numerical experiment we present
the order reduction phenomenon, and show how it can degrade the accuracy of
high order (p) low stage order (q = 1) multistage methods. We further show that
the proposed methods maintain their corresponding orders of consistency (p).
5.1

Monotonicity

Methods with SSP properties are needed to evolve in time solutions that may
develop discontinuities of hyperbolic PDEs. The SSP conditions impose a very
strict restriction on the time steps, and hence the time stepping scheme eﬃciency
is very important.
Figure 2 shows the solutions of the advection equation obtained with the
proposed methods MM p3 q3 (4) and MM p4 q3 (5) and the optimal third
order RK scheme, RK3, with three stages, C = 1 (C = 0.33) [6,8]. The space
discretization is ﬁrst order upwind, chosen for its well understood behavior. The
time step for MM p3 q3 is such that the CFL coeﬃcient is 1.3. At t = 0.22
(Figure 2.a) the MM method solution remains oscillation free, while the RK3
solution shows the eﬀects of linear instability. The solution obtained by using
MM p4 q3 (Figure 2.b) is also stable, but at a lower CFL coeﬃcient comparable,
however, with the one used for the MM p3 q3 case; i.e., MM p3 q3 and RK3
require three function evaluations per step, and hence, a CFL of two thirds is
needed for a fair comparison.
We next explore the monotonicity properties of the SSP MM methods on a
nonlinear hyperbolic equation. The inviscid Burgers’ equation is
∂ 1
∂y(t, x)
+
y(t, x)2
∂t
∂x 2

= 0,

0 ≤ x ≤ 1 , 0 ≤ t ≤ tFinal .

(6)

The spatial discretization uses the third-order upwind-biased ﬂux limited scheme
based [4,10,11]. This spatial discretization is SSP with forward Euler steps and
hence, with the proposed MM methods described in this work. The SSP condition
is satisﬁed if the CFL coeﬃcient of the method C is smaller than the CFL number
of the problem: C ≤ problem CFL number = max(y)Δt/Δx.
In Figure 3 we show the solution of the Burgers’ equation integrated with RK3
(s = 3, C = 1) and MM p3 q3 (4) (C=1.44) at time 0.25 with a method CFL of 1.5.

classical RK method becomes unstable.
Avoiding Order Reduction

Order reduction describes the behavior where the eﬀective order of a numerical method on a given problem is
smaller than its theoretical order as
given by the classical theory. Order reduction can considerably degrade the
eﬃciency of the numerical integration.
Moreover, order reduction is diﬃcult
to detect in practical computations because embedded methods used for error estimation are also aﬀected by it.
Explicit RK methods have the stage
order equal to one, which makes them
susceptible of order reduction for problems with non-homogeneous boundary conditions and/or nonzero source
terms. In order to illustrate this, we
consider the test problem from [14]
(advection with a nonlinear source
term):

linear in space, allowing us to use ﬁrst order upwind space discretization without
introducing discretization errors. For the time integration we employ the typical
RK methods of orders 2, 3, and 4. Sanz-Serna et al. [14] show that RK methods
with p ≥ 3 suﬀer from order reduction. This theoretical result is veriﬁed in our
numerical experiment.
Figure 4.a shows the discretization error versus the time step with the forcing
terms switched oﬀ [14]. In this case all methods retain their expected order, verifying the classical theory. In Figure 4.b we show the results with stiﬀ boundary
and source terms. In this case both the third order RK3a method [5] and the
fourth order “classical” RK4 method [7] display second order behavior. In these
situations a second order method can be more eﬃcient than higher order methods. The high stage order proposed methods MM p3 q3 (4) and MM p4 q3 (5)
retain their corresponding orders of consistency.

Discussion

In this paper we introduce two new explicit multistage-multistep methods with
high stage orders for solving ordinary diﬀerential equations and PDEs via the
method of lines. The MM methods are SSP – they have the monotonicity properties of forward Euler scheme, but under a diﬀerent time step restriction.
To our knowledge the proposed methods are the ﬁrst explicit high-stage order
SSP methods. The two numerical experiments presented in this paper motivate
both properties – SSP and high stage order.
An error control mechanism can be considered by using a lower order embedded method; however, changing the time step requires restarting the method.
