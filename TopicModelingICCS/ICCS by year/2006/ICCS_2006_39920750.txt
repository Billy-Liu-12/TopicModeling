Abstract. The search for the association between complex diseases and
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes has been recently
received great attention. For these studies, it is essential to use a small
subset of informative SNPs (tag SNPs) accurately representing the rest
of the SNPs. Tagging can achieve budget savings by genotyping only a
limited number of SNPs and computationally inferring all other SNPs
and compaction of extremely long SNP sequences (obtained, e.g., from
Aﬃmetrix Map Array) for further ﬁne genotype analysis. Tagging should
ﬁrst choose tags from the SNPs under consideration and then knowing
the values of chosen tag SNPs predict (or statistically cover) the non-tag
SNPs. In this paper we propose a new SNP prediction method based
on rounding of multivariate linear regression (MLR) analysis in sigmarestricted coding. When predicting a non-tag SNP, the MLR method
accumulates information about all tag SNPs resulting in signiﬁcantly
higher prediction accuracy with the same number of tags than for the
previously known tagging methods. We also show that the tag selection
strongly depends on how the chosen tags will be used – advantage of one
tag set over another can only be considered with respect to a certain prediction method. Two simple universal tag selection methods have been
applied: a (faster) stepwise and a (slower) local-minimization tag selection algorithms. An extensive experimental study on various datasets
including 6 regions from HapMap shows that the MLR prediction combined with stepwise tag selection uses signiﬁcantly fewer tags (e.g., up to
two times less tags to reach 90% prediction accuracy) than the state-ofart methods of Halperin et al. [8] for genotypes and Halldorsson et al. [7]
for haplotypes, respectively. Our stepwise tagging matches the quality of
while being faster than STAMPA [8]. The code is publicly available at

Tag SNP Selection Based on Multivariate Linear Regression

751

For these studies, it is essential to use a small subset of informative SNPs (tag
SNPs) accurately representing the rest of the SNPs. Tagging can achieve budget
savings by genotyping only a limited number of SNPs and computationally inferring all other SNPs and compaction of extremely long SNP sequences (obtained,
e.g., from Aﬃmetrix Map Array) for further ﬁne genotype analysis.
Tagging methods have been previously explored in statistical and pattern
recognition community as well as optimization community. In statistics, tags
are required to statistically cover individual (non-tagged) SNPs or haplotypes
(sets of SNPs), where the quality of statistical covering is usually measured by
correlation, e.g., ﬁnd minimum number of tags such that for any non-tag SNP
there exists a highly correlated (squared correlation R2 > .8) tag SNP [2, 4]. In
the optimization community, the number of tags is usually minimized subject
to upper bounds on prediction error measured in leave-one-out cross-validation
experiments [7, 8].
The generic tagging problem can be formulated as follows: Given a sample S
of a population P of individuals (either haplotypes or genotypes) on m SNPs,
ﬁnd positions of k (k < m) tag SNPs such that one can predict (or statistically
cover) an entire individual (haplotype or genotype) from its restriction onto
the k tag SNPs. This tagging problem formulation implicitly relies on a certain
prediction or statistical covering method. The corresponding SNP prediction
problem is formulated as follows: Given the values of k tags of the individual x
with unknown SNP s and n individuals with k tag SNP and known value of SNP
s, ﬁnd the value of s in x. Respectively, each non-tag SNP must be statistically
covered by a tag SNP or multiple tag SNPs as proposed below.
In this paper we propose a new SNP prediction based on rounding of multivariate linear regression (MLR) analysis in sigma-restricted coding. The MLR
method predicts the non-tag SNP s so that the predicted s is the closest to its
projection on the span of vectors corresponding to tag SNPs. Respectively, the
MLR method statistically covers s by its projection. The MLR method accumulates information about all tag SNPs resulting in signiﬁcantly higher prediction
accuracy with the same number of tags. In contrast, the previous SNP prediction
methods rely either on a single SNP (see, e.g., [2]), a pair of tag SNPs [8], or
small number of tag SNPs from the block with limited haplotype diversity [14].
Our previous linear-algebraic tag selection and SNP prediction [9, 10] picks linear independent tag SNPs but cannot easily handle bounds on prediction error
or number of tags. We show that the tag selection strongly depends on how the
chosen tags will be used – advantage of one tag set over another can only be
considered with respect to a certain prediction method. We suggest two simple
universal methods for tag selection based on known prediction method: a (faster)
stepwise and a (slower) local-minimization tag selection algorithms.
An extensive experimental study on various datasets including 6 regions from
HapMap [1] shows that the MLR prediction combined with stepwise tag selection
uses signiﬁcantly fewer tags (e.g., up to two times less tags to reach 90% prediction
accuracy) than the state-of-art methods of Halperin et al. [8] for genotypes and
Halldorsson et al. [7] for haplotypes, respectively. Our stepwise tagging matches

752

the quality of while being faster than STAMPA [8]. When applied to statistical
covering, our method also uses fewer tags than the state-of-the-art method of Carlson et al. [2] especially when high correlation (r2 > .8) is required.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our MLR
SNP prediction algorithm. Section 3 shows how to separate tag selection problem
from SNP prediction or statistical covering and describes the general approach
for tag selection based on the way how tags are used. Section 4 presents an
experimental results and discussions.

The MLR SNP Prediction Algorithm

Usually, a genotype is represented by a vector with coordinates 0,1, or 2, where
0 represents the homozygous site with major allele, 1 represents the homozygous
site with minor allele, and 2 represents the heterozygous site. Respectively, each
haplotype’s coordinate is 0 or 1, where 0 represents the major allele and 1 represents the minor allele. The sample population S together with the tag-restricted
individual x are represented as a matrix M . The matrix M has n + 1 rows
corresponding to n sample individuals and the individual x and k + 1 columns
corresponding to k tag SNPs and a single non-tag SNP s. All values in M are
known except the value of s in x. In case of haplotypes, there are only two possible resolutions of s, namely, s0 and s1 with the unknown SNP value equal to 0
or 1, respectively. For genotypes, there are 3 possible resolutions s0 , s1 , and s2
corresponding to SNP values 0, 1, or 2, respectively. The SNP prediction method
should chose correct resolution of s.
The proposed MLR SNP prediction method considers all possible resolutions
of s together with the set of tag SNPs T as the vectors in (n + 1)-dimensional
Euclidean space. It assumes that the most probable resolution of s should be the
“closest” to T . The distance between resolution of s and T is measured between
s and its projection on the vector space span(T ), the span of the set of tag SNPs
T (see Figure 1).

predicted 1 since the distance between s1 and its projection sT1 is the shorter than for
s0 and s2 .

Computationally, the distance between a resolution si and T is measured as
dist(T, si ) = |T · (T t · T )−1 · T t · si − si |. The runtime of the MLR SNP prediction
algorithm is O(kn2 ). In general, there are m− k non-tag SNPs in each individual
but the matrix T · (T t · T )−1 · T t is the same for all these non-tag SNPs and
should be computed only once. Thus, the total runtime for predicting a complete
individual is O(kn(n + m)).
Instead of {0, 1, 2} notation, we use sigma-encoding {−1, 1, 0} of SNP values
proposed in [10]: 0’s are replaced by −1’s and 2’s are replaced with 0’s. Our
experiments show that MLR with {−1, 0, 1} notations needs up to 30% less tags
than with the original {0, 2, 1} notations for reaching same prediction accuracy.

Tag SNP Selection Methods

Assuming self-similarity of data, one can expect that an algorithm predicting
with high accuracy SNPs of an unknown individual will also predict with high
accuracy SNPs of the sampled individual. Then, we expect that the better prediction algorithm will have fewer errors when predicting SNPs in the sample S.
This expectation allows us to ﬁnd tags using prediction algorithm as follows: We
can check each k-tuple of tags and choose the k-tuple with the minimal number
of errors in predicting the non-tag SNPs in the sampled individuals. Even though
the sample elements are completely typed, prediction algorithms can make still
errors because the number of SNPs may be not suﬃcient to distinguish any two
sampled individuals. Thus, tag SNP selection based on prediction is reduced to
the following problem:
Tag SNP Selection for Prediction. Given a prediction algorithm Ak and a
sample S, ﬁnd k tags such that the prediction error e of Ak averaged over all
SNPs in S (including tags) is minimized.
Similarly, a statistical covering criteria has as an input a set of k column-tags
(t1 , · · · , tk ) and a single SNP s on the sample S. Ak checks if the set of tags has
a statistically signiﬁcant correlation with s. For example, in Carlson et al. [2]
Ak checks if the R2 between s and ti ’s is higher than a certain threshold (e.g.,
0.8). A similar criteria is deﬁned in Stram et al. [13]. In this paper, we suggest to
compute Ak as a correlation between s and si predicted using MLR algorithm.
The statistical covering version of the tag SNP selection can be formulated as
follows:
Tag SNP Selection for Statistical covering. Given a statistical covering
criteria Ak and a sample S, ﬁnd k tags such that the number of statistically
covered SNPs (including tags) according to Ak is maximized.
In general, these problems are computationally diﬃcult and the runtime of an
exact algorithm may become prohibitively slow. Below we propose two universal
heuristics which can be applied to an arbitrary prediction algorithm or statistical
covering criteria Ak .
The Stepwise Tagging algorithm (STA) starts with the best tag t0 , i.e., tag
that minimizes error when predicting with Ak all other tags. Then STA ﬁnds

754

such tag t1 which would be the best extension of {t0 } and continue adding best
tags until reaching the set of tags of the given size k. STA produces hereditary
set of tags, i.e., the chosen k tags contain the chosen k − 1 tags. This hereditary
property may be useful in case if the set of tags can be extended. The runtime
of STA is O(knmT ), where T is the runtime of the prediction algorithm. Note
that for statistical covering, STA is equivalent to the greedy algorithm used by
Carlson et al. [2].
The Local-Minimization Tag Selection algorithm (LMT) is more accurately
searching for a better set of tags among much larger possibilities. LMT starts
with the k tags produced by STA and then iteratively replaces each single tag
with the best possible choice while not changing other tags. Such replacements
will be continued until no signiﬁcant improvement in the prediction quality (i.e.,
by more than given amount of %) can be achieved. The runtime of LMT is
O(knmT −1 ) since the number of iterations cannot exceed 100 .

Experimental Results

We ﬁrst list the test datasets, then compare the MLR prediction method combined with STA and LMT. Next comparison of prediction accuracy and statistical covering is given as well comparison of MLR with Idselect. Finally, we
give the comparison results of MLR with the state-of-art genotype tagging of
STAMPA [8], and haplotype tagging of Haldorsson et al. [7] and He et al. [10].
The following datasets are used to measure the quality of our algorithms.
Currently, our algorithms cannot tolerate missing data. Following Halperin et
al.[8], we use GERBIL [6] to phase the genotypes and then combine the resulting
two haplotypes to recover any missing data.
Three ENCODE regions. Three regions (ENm013, ENr112, ENr113) from 30
CEPH family trios obtained from HapMap ENCODE Project [1]. The number
of SNPs genotyped in each region is 361, 412 and 515 respectively.
Two gene regions. Two gene regions STEAP and TRPM8 from 30 CEPH
family trios obtained from HapMap [1]. The number of SNPs genotyped in each
gene region is 23 and 102 SNPs.
Chromosome 5q31. The data set collected by Daly et al. [5] derived from the
616 kilobase region of human Chromosome 5q31 from 129 family trios.
LPL & Chromosome 21. The Clark et al. [3] data set consists of the haplotypes of 71 individuals typed over 88 SNPs in the human lipoprotein lipase
(LPL) gene. The Chromosome 21 data set consists the ﬁrst 1, 000 of 24, 047
SNPs typed over 20 haploid copies of human Chromosome 21 [11].
We apply leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the quality of the solution
given by the tag SNP selection and prediction methods. One by one, each individual is removed from the sample. Then, tag SNPs are selected using only the
remaining individuals. The “left out” individual is reconstructed based on its
tag SNPs and the remaining individuals in the sample. The prediction accuracy
is percent of correctly predicted SNPs in all individuals.

Table 1 presents the results of leave-one-out experiments on the 6 genotype
datasets. STA combined with MLR (MLR/STA) has almost the same quality as
LMT combined with MLR (MLR/LMT) while being much faster. For example,
when we perform the test on TRPM8 dataset, MLR/STA needs 4 seconds to
reach 95% prediction accuracy while MLR/LMT needs 51 seconds.1
Table 2 compares the prediction accuracy of MLR/STA and STAMPA
(Halperin et al. [8]). MLR/STA requires fewer tag SNPs and faster than
STAMPA. For example, for TRPM8 data, MLR/STA in 6 seconds selects 12
tags to reach 96.6% accuracy, while STAMPA in 34 seconds selects 12 tags to
reach only 94.2% accuracy. Since the MLR prediction algorithm can be applied
to haplotypes, we compare it with the methods of Halldorson et al. [7] and He
et al. [10] in leave-one-out tests on the LPL & Chromosome 21 datasets. Figure
2 shows that the MLR/STA considerably improves over the both methods.
For maximizing statistical covering, each (non-tag) SNP-column s is predicted
with the MLR prediction algorithm. We say that the SNP-column s is counted
as statistically covered if squared correlation R2 between the predicted SNPcolumn s and given SNP-column s is at least 0.8. In Table 3, the ﬁrst two rows
show the correlation of prediction accuracy and number of statistically covered
SNPs. The third row shows that it is slightly better to use the correct objective
(i.e., statistical covering) rather than prediction accuracy in order to maximize
the number of statistically covered SNPs. Table 4 shows that MLR/STA uses
on average 30% fewer tags than IdSelect [2] for statistical covering all SNPs.

Conclusions

The paper gives a new SNP prediction method based on multivariate linear
regression and suggests two universal tag selection methods. The MLR method
combined with stepwise tag selection uses signiﬁcantly fewer tags (e.g., up to
two times less tags to reach 90% prediction accuracy) than the state-of-theart methods of Halperin et al. [8] for genotypes and Halldorsson et al. [7] for
haplotypes, respectively. Our stepwise tagging matches the quality of while being
faster than STAMPA [8]. When applied to statistical covering, our method also
uses fewer tags than the state-of-the-art method of Carlson et al. [2] especially
when high correlation (R2 > .8) is required.
