Abstract. This paper proposes two practically and eﬃciently supervised and unsupervised classiﬁcations for surimi gel strength patterns.
An supervised learning method, backpropagation neural network with
three layers of 17-34-4 neurons for each later, is used. An unsupervised
classiﬁcation method consists of the data dimensionality reduction step
via the PCA algorithm and classiﬁcation step using correlation coeﬃcient similarity measure. In the similarity measure step, each surimi gel
strength pattern is compared with the surimi eigen-gel patterns, produced by the PCA step. In this paper, we consider a datum pattern as
a datum dimension. The training data sets (12 patterns or 12 data dimensions) of surimi gel strength are collected from 4 experiments having
diﬀerent ﬁxed setting temperature at 35o C, 40o C, 45o C, and 50o C, respectively. Testing data sets (48 patterns) are including original training
set and their added Gaussian noise with 1, 3 and 5 points, respectively.
From the experiments, two proposed methods can classify all testing data
sets into its proper class.
Keywords: Backpropagation neural network, Principal component

Introduction

Surimi is a concentrate of the myoﬁbrillar proteins, primarily myosin and actin,
of ﬁsh muscle, that is mechanically deboned, water-washed ﬁsh meat. In order
to manufacture surimi-based products, the raw or frozen surimi is ground with
salt and other ingredients, and then passed through thermal processing to set
the shape and develop the texture [8]. During the thermal process, myoﬁbrillar
protein is induced to form the actomyosin gel, mainly derived from the myosin
portions, which gives the unique elastic textural properties of the products [4].
Surimi is very well-known in food processing topics. Applications or surimi based
products are Crap-analog or Kani-kamabogo, Kamaboko, Chikuwa, Satsumage,
ﬁsh sausage and Shell ﬁsh-analog, etc. [8]

Generally, surimi gel is formed following two heating-steps, a preheating process below 50o C (setting step) prior to cooking at 80o C or 90o C to produce
an opaque, highly elastic and strengthened gel [8]. The setting period is an
important step in surimi gel development. This is because the setting at low
temperature prior to heating at a higher temperature allows slow ordering of
the protein molecule resulting in good gelation, ﬁne structure and great elasticity [6] [8]. Diﬀerent temperatures in the setting step result in diﬀerent conformation of the proteins leading to diﬀerent structure, and strength of the ﬁnal
gel [7].
The qualities of surimi gel, notably gel strength and structure, can be aﬀected
during gelation by various physical conditions such as high pressure, heating
temperature and heating period during setting. In this paper, we emphasize on
only surimi gel strength patterns which obtained from various setting temperatures and times. From the preliminary experiments, it can be observed that
all patterns of surimi gel strength have similar shape. The ﬁnal gel strengths
increased to the maximum value and then decreased to the plateau in all setting tempertures. It is diﬃcult to determine classes of each surimi gel strenth.
In order to determine their proper classes, both supervised and unsupervised
classiﬁcation learning methods are applied to identify the qualities of surimi gel
pattern.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains Cod surimi material,
backpropagation neural network, principal surimi gel strength construction, and
similarity method; Some experimental results are presented in Section 3 and
conclusions in Section 4, respectively.

2.1

Materials and Methods
Materials

Cod (Gadus morhua) ﬁllets were purchased from Frosts Fish LTD, Reading, UK.
The ﬁllets were skinned, rinsed with clean water, blended in a Lab Micronizer
(Waring Commercial), washed by the ratio of water: minced ﬁsh at 3:1 (v/w).
Then, the minced ﬁsh was dewatered by a basket centrifuge, then mixed with
6% sugar and 0.2% tetrasodium pyrophosphate and stored in an air blast freezer
at -18o C as a frozen surimi sample.
2.2

Gel Preparation

The frozen surimi was thawed at 4o C until the temperature of surimi reached
0o C and then, mixed with 2.5% salt by using a Lab Micronizer (Waring Commercial). The sol obtained was stuﬀed into stainless-steel cylinders of 2.5 cm.
inner diameter and 2.5 cm. length. Surimi gels were prepared by heat setting at
35o C, 40o C, 45o C and 50o C for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 120,
180, 240, and 300 minutes in a water bath (Grant Y28, type VFP). Then, the
gels were cooked at 90o C for 20 minutes, and cooled in ice water. The obtained
surimi gels were stored at 4o C for 24 hours before analysed.

Gel Strength Analysis

The gel strengths of surimi gels were tested by using a TA-XT2 Texture Analyser
(Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Surrey, UK.). All the cooked gels were compressed to
15 mm at the speed of 1.1 mm/second using a cylindrical shaped probe of 2.5 cm
in diameter. Then, the changes in applied force were recorded. The gel strength
was obtained from the peak force multiplied by the compression distance at the
peak.
2.4

Proposed Classiﬁcation Methods

The objective of the paper is to classify each surimi gel strength pattern into
a proper class. We propose both supervised and unsupervised learning methods
to identify the class or quality of surimi gel patterns.
Backpropagation Neural Network. Artiﬁcial neural network or neural network is a parallel processing mechanism which similar to human brain learning system. There are both supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning systems [5]. The ﬁrst and simple neural network structure is called the
Perceptron neural network. Perceptron consists of input neurons, connection
weight, adding function, activation function, and output as illustrated in
Fig. 1(a).

where [x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ]T are the input vectors, [w1 , w2 , · · · , wn ]T are the connection weights, β is a bias, f () is an activation function and y is an output. y can
be written as follows:
net =

(x1 w1 + x2 w2 + · · · + xn wn ) + β

y = f (net)

The backpropagation neural network [5] with three layers, input-hidden- output, is used. The neurons in each layer are 17-34-4 for input-hidden-output layer,
respectively. Neural network learning algorithm starts with the random weight
whi and wjh . The input vectors [x1 , x2 , · · · , x17 ]T are fed to the hidden layer Z
using the weight whi . Then hidden vectors [z1 , z2 , · · · , z34 ]T are fed again by the
weight wjh in order to produce the output vectors [y1 , · · · , y4 ]T . Backpropagation
network structure is shown in Fig. 1(b). Let t be a desired target. The objective
function is a summed squared error (SSE) as follows:
E=

1
2

(y − t)2

(3)

And the activation function is a Sigmoidal function as follows:
f (net) =

1
1 + e−net

(4)

Principal Component Analysis to Surimi Gel Pattern. The second
method for classifying each surimi gel strength is the Principal component analysis and the similarity measure method. An identiﬁable system consists of two
main parts, the construction of surimi gel eigen-patterns and similarity analysis.
First, the PCA method is used for searching an eigen-pattern by returning the
principal direction for each class of surimi gel quality. Second, correlation coefﬁcient similarity method between the eigen gel pattern and surimi gel strength
pattern is used for classifying a class of them. A structure chart of the overall
system is illustrated in Figure 2.

Gel Eigen Pattern

Fig. 2. System Structures for Surimi Gel Pattern Identiﬁcation

Constructing principal direction or eigen-pattern is presented in this section
[2]. Constructing procedures are composed of two main steps, surimi gel strength
matrix formation and computing an eigen-pattern. First, the surimi gel strength
matrix formation step, input data for modeling surimi gel eigen-patterns are

Classiﬁcation of Surimi Gel Strength Patterns

407

surimi gel strength from 3 replications, detailed in Section 2.2. Then from the
previous conditions, three input vectors of surimi gel strength were obtained for
each setting temperature. And they are formed as a row major matrix with a
dimension of 3 by 17.
Second, computing an eigen-pattern step, the principal component analysis
can be carried out. The calculation of surimi gel eigen-pattern is given by the
solution to the following step [3]:
1. Compute the mean for each row meani
2. Generate the zero-mean matrix Mz for each row i,
Mzi,j = Mi,j − meani

(5)

where 1 ≤ i ≤ 17.
3. Compute the covariance matrix Cov for Mz,
T

Cov(Mz) = E[(Mz)(Mz) ]

(6)

T

where E[.] is an expectation value and (Mz) is a transpose matrix of Mz.
Then the dimensions of Cov(Mz) are 3 by 3.
4. Compute an eigenvalue, d, and eigenvector, v, for the covariance matrix Cov.
5. Project M onto new axis by eigen-vector v,
P = vT M

(7)

where v T is a transpose matrix of v
Similarity Measure. The main objective of the classiﬁcation problem is to
ﬁnd a natural grouping in a set of data [3]. In other words, we want to say that
the samples in class ci are more like one another than like samples in other class
cj , where i = j.
Correlation Coeﬃcient Analysis, ρ. The correlation coeﬃcient ρ between two
random variable x and y can be described as:
ρ(x, y) =

cov(x, y)
var(x)var(y)

(8)

where cov(x, y) is the covariance between two random variables and var(.) is
the variance of a random variable. Correlation coeﬃcient values are within
[−1, . . . , 1]. If x and y are completely correlated, ρ(x, y) is 1 or -1. If they are
absolutely uncorrelated, ρ(x, y) is 0.

Experimental Results

Some simulations have been made on surimi Gel Strength patterns, which contain 17 data points for each pattern, details were given in Section 2.2. Testing
sets (12 data) include the original training set and their added Gaussian noise
with 1, 3 and 5 points, respectively. Then, in total, the testing sets have 48
patterns. Graphical representation of all testing sets are illustrated in

Figure 3 (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. It can be seen that it is very diﬃcult
to identify a class for input pattern by hand. How can we do that?
3.1

Backpropagation Neural Network

In the learning step, we set ≤ 0.00001. The learning is terminated after 35
epochs. Tables 1(a), (b), (c), and (d) display the probability of each surimi gel
strength pattern to be each expected class. Probability values from Tables 1(a),
(b), (c), and (d) conﬁrm that all testing set patterns can be classiﬁed into a
proper class even they have some noises. For example from Table 1(d), degree
of similarity between testing pattern 1 to expected class 1, class 2, class 3, and
class 4 are 0.9957, 0.0000, 0.0000, and 0.0000, respectively. Then, it is classiﬁed
to class 1 which is correct.
3.2

Principal Component Analysis

Tables 2(a), (b), (c) and (d) display the degree of similarity between testing
data sets and the principal direction of surimi gel strength using correlation
coeﬃcient analysis. Degree of similarity among them from Tables 2(a), (b), (c)
and (d) conﬁrm that all testing set patterns can be classifed into a proper class
even they have some noises. For example from Table 2(c), degree of similarity
between testing pattern 3 to expected class 1, class 2, class 3, and class 4 are
0.9462, 0.8789, 0.7765, and 0.4154, respectively. Then it is classiﬁed to class 1
which is correct.

supervised learning method. But PCA is an unsupervised classiﬁcation method
based on data information. Throughout the paper, the identiﬁcation of surimi gel
patterns using Backpropagation neural network and eigen-pattern together with
the correlation coeﬃcient has been outlined. Good identiﬁcation is obtained from
the Backpropagation neural network but we need to know a class of each pattern
in advance. On the other hand, the advantages of the PCA method developed
in this paper are as follows. (1) Each class or principal direction of surimi gel
strengths is obtained by an unsupervised method, the PCA. Thus, for further
identiﬁcation of the surimi gel strength class, we can easily do this by passing
surimi gel strength into the PCA. Then a new class of surimi gel strengths is
created. In other words, the principal direction of surimi gel strengths is dynamic based on data characteristics. (2) It can be concluded that the correlation
coeﬃcient method gives an eﬃcient result in the case where the testing patterns
have very similar shape.
