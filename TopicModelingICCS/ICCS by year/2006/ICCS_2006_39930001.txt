Abstract. The term "the Grid" was coined in the mid 1990s to denote a
proposed distributed computing infrastructure for advanced science and
engineering. Grid computing technology is a new way for remotely sensed data
processing. Special remotely sensed data processing Grid node provides
convenient, consistent spatial information processing service for user. In this
paper we mainly discusses information registry mechanism and method for
remotely sensed data processing module and algorithm in Grid environment and
gives the remotely sensed meta-module conception. Then based on the
characteristic of remotely sensed data processing module and Grid technology,
we describe remotely sensed data processing meta-module information registry
method and give a concrete example.

1 Introduction
Grid is an integrated computing and resources environment, or a location for
computing resources. Grid can absorb all kinds of resources for computing, and
transfer them into available, reliable, standard and economic computing ability.
Besides computers, computing resources also include web communication abilities,
data, instruments and equipments, and even people. Foster et al. [4] defined "Grid
problem", which is defined as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among
dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources –what they referred to
as virtual organizations (VO) [3].
Dozens of satellites constantly collecting data about our planetary system 24 hours
a day and 365 days a year [7]. Remote Sensing data is characterized by largeness and
instantaneousness. The analysis and sharing of these huge amounts of data is a big

challenge for the remote sensing community [6]. Grid computing technology provides
a good way to process remotely sensed data and sharing the processed spatial
information through combining virtual super computing power storage resource on
the Internet.
Today there have several famous Grid projects in spatial information field. Within
the DataGrid project funded by the European Union, Work Package (WP) 9 of the
Data aims to demonstrate the use of Grid technology for remote sensing applications
and earth observation [5]. Earth Observation Grid (ESG) is a research project
sponsored by the U.S. DOE Office of Science under the Scientific Discovery through
Advanced Computing program (SciDAC). The aim of this project is to analyze
climate variety all over the earth surface [1]. Information Power Grid
(http://www.ipg.nasa.gov/) is the NASA’s computational support for aerospace
development, planetary science and other NASA research.
The spatial information can be collected, shared, organized, and processed with
Spatial Information Grid (SIG), which has been sponsored by Ministry of Science and
Technology of the People’s Republic of China. It is the infrastructure that manages
and processes spatial data according to users’ demand (http://www.spatial.org).
Through demonstration applications in some key fields, develop Spatial Information
Grid to promote the industrialization of spatial information resources. (http:// www
.863.org.cn/english/annual_report/annual_repor_2001/200210090014.html)
Remotely sensed data is one of the most important spatial information sources, so
the research on architectures and technical supports of Grid-based remotely sensed
data processing node is the significant part of the research on SIG. Today, remotely
sensed data processing modules and algorithms are the valuable resources, which can
be used as a service for users who are not familiar with remotely sensed data
processing methods. It can also avoid rewriting the same algorithms over and over
again for different people through sharing the remote sense algorithms and module as
a resource service. The key of using this valuable resource is how to let users
conveniently find them and how to get use of them in Grid environment in order to
share resources. To solve the above problem, we must let the remotely sensed data
processing module be indexed in the Grid environment. The service information of
the remotely sensed data processing module should clearly describe category of the
algorithms and how to operate in Grid environment with these resources. Grid service
request will be submitted to special remotely sensed data processing node with virtual
super computing power after user searching the service information. Service Data
technology of OGSA in Globus provides a effective method for information registry.
We will discuss the metadata and method and mechanism of remotely sensed data
processing module service registry in Grid environment based on Globus toolkit3.0.2
as follows.

Service Data technology of Globus (GT3.x) provides the fundamental method to
describe service content in Grid environment.

2.1 Service Data of OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture)
Service Data is the aggregation structure that is related to Grid service [2]. It must be
conveniently indexed and classified though Service Data Element (SDE). A service
data declaration is a mechanism of publicly expressing the available state information
of a service through a known schema. There are two types of service data elements
(http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/grid/library):
•
•

Static:
Declared as part of the service's interface definition (GWSDL portType
definition)
Dynamic:
Added to a service instance dynamically. This behaviour is implementationspecific. The client may know the semantics (type and meaning) of the
service data, or you can acquire that information from somewhere. For
example, in order to process the dynamic SDE values you may need to get
the schema for the SDE from a remote location.

The Service Data Element (SDE) model provides standard mechanisms for
querying, updating, adding and removing data associated with each Grid service
instance
2.2 Remote Sensing Meta-module Service Data in Grid Environment
2.2.1 Conception of Grid-Based Remote Sensing Meta-module
We give the conception of Grid-based remote sensing meta-module as following: The
metadata that describe serials of remotely sensed data processing modules and
algorithms in order to publish and manage these resources in Grid environment. The
description of Grid-based remote sensing meta-module must include function express
of the algorithm, input and output description, control parameter description etc. As
Grid-based remote sensing meta-module, they must match these conditions:
• They must be described as the form of the Service Data Element (SDE) of Grid
Service.
• Expression schema must match with the rule of the Grid Web Service
Description Language (GWSDL)
• They can clearly describe the name, function, input and output parameter of the
remotely sensed data processing module.
• Service Data used to describe remote sensing module must be static, which will
not change until the module and algorithms become update.
2.2.2 Meta-module Service Data Structure in OGSA
The structure of the remote sensing meta-module seems as dendriform organization
(Figure 1). RSService Instance will be produced by remotely sensed data processing
service factory. We can give above figure embodiment: RSService Factory can be
supposed as an service factory to produce remotely sensed image classification
service instance. The same classification algorithm has different Service Data Set,
which is made up of several Service Data Elements. Also we can suppose that Service
Data Element A describes that classification algorithm service can provide classified

image after the task, and Data Element B describes that classification service can
provide description document or log file about this task.
If users not only want to get the classified image but log files about this task, they
can choice RSService Instance A that is described by Service Data Set A. If users
only want to get the classified image, they can just choice RSService Instance B that
is described by Service Data Set B.

2.2.3 Grid-Based Remotely Sensed Meta-module Service Data Item
In order to clearly describe remotely sensed data processing module service
information, Grid-based remote sensing meta-module Service Data must include
description of the module and algorithm, input data, threshold value, output
information, running time. Service Data items are shown in the following table
(Table1). Keyword item mainly contains description content of Grid-based metamodule. Model_Descritption item mainly express the name of the algorithm, function,
developed date of the module. Input_Data item seems complex because of diversity of
the remotely sensed data format. Output_Data item has the flexibility according to
user’s demand.Remote sensing information service can provide image or document
result. Data Type item is the XML element type description in Grid Web Services
Description Language (GWSDL).

RunTime_Mbyte means how many seconds this module process per mega-byte
remotely sensed data using a certain algorithm.Though this service data item ,user can
easily estimate the time by simple multiplication because most of the algorithm
analyze pixel one by one.But the result of RunTime_Mbyte must be tested before a
meta-module service data being published.There are many remote sensing data types
which is described as complex type in Grid Web Service Descritpion
Language(GWSDL). Input_Data Service Data is the descritpiong of remote sensing

2.2.4 Service Data Description of Grid-Based Remotely Sensed Meta-module

3 Grid-Based Remotely Sensed Meta-module Service Registry
Combing Globus Open Grid Service Infrastructure (OGSI) rules and remotely sensed
meta-module above, we provide the remotely sensed Grid service registry method
(Figure 2). Serials of remotely sensed data processing module service data is
registered in the registry container of the special remotely sensed data processing Grid
node through Service Data provider, such as NDVI Service Data Provider, aerosol
computing Service Data Provider, image classification Service Data Provider, etc. For
user, they can search the proper service from the service data through special portal
made up of remote sensing service set. There are two ways to find service through
Grid service, one is based on demand line, and the other is Grid browser (Figure 3).
User can use the browser to find the proper service description while inputting the
service Uniform Resource Locators (URL) of remotely sensed data processing
service.

4 Conclusion
Grid technology is a very effective method for remotely sensed data processing
service. Through it the existing remotely sensed data processing modules and
algorithms resource can be shared seems like the common service in Grid
environment. It much enhances the resource utility rate. In order to publish, describe,
and manage Grid service data, the paper puts forward a Grid-based remotely sensed
meta-module conception and corresponding structure. Combing the rule of this
conception and OGSI technology, we define the Grid-based remotely sensed metamodule service data and Service Data Description language schema. Through
remotely sensed Service Data Provider, the remote sensing service can be register in
the Registry Container of the special remotely sensed data processing Grid node.
Users can also search and choice the proper service by demand line or Grid browser.
After that, he can send a service request to Grid computing node according to the
service data description.
