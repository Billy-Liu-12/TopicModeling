Abstract. The modeling approach is the only possible way to estimate the
biomechanic function of the different anatomical sub-structures of the knee
joint in physiological conditions. Subject-specific geometry and kinematic data
were the foundations of the 3D quasi-static model adopted for the present work.
A previously validated cruciate ligaments model was implemented taking the
anatomical twist of the fibers into account. The anatomical load components,
developed by the modeled ligaments, were estimated during step up/down
motor tasks. The anterior cruciate ligament never developed force, along every
directions. The posterior cruciate ligament developed increasing forces with the
increasing of the flexion angle until at about 70° of flexion. Bigger repeatability
in the force curves was obtained in extension with respect to the flexion
movement. In conclusion the proposed model was effective in evaluating loads
in the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament during the execution of daily
living activities.

1 Introduction
In the human knee joint, the harmonious interaction among all its different anatomical
sub-units provides the well known mobility and stability characteristics. The
knowledge of the biomechanic function of the knee passive structures, like the
cruciate ligaments, is of fundamental importance and of great clinical interest for the
development of new effective rehabilitative and surgical procedures. This interest is
demonstrated by over 8 million of injury related visits for knee symptoms by
physicians and in emergency rooms, 381000 total knee replacements and 12000 other
repair of cruciate ligaments performed in the USA in 2002 as reported by the
American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) [1].
During its normal function, the knee lets the shank move with respect to the thigh,
maintaining the stability under external articular load and torque. This is the result of
several contributions: inter-segmental contact loads, ligaments tensioning, muscle
forces, inertia of body segments. Thus, if we want to quantify the contribution of each
anatomical structure, the only possible way is a modeling approach.

The problem of the knee modeling has been tackled from different points of view
and at different levels of complexity. Many two-dimensional models on sagittal plane
were proposed in literature and several of these were based on a four–bar linkage
modeling approach [2-6]. These models allowed to investigate the function of the
knee ligaments only in the sagittal plane in different loading conditions [7;8]. Threedimensional mathematical and finite elements models were also developed [9-12].
These can include sub-models of anatomical articular surfaces and contact forces, of
articular deformations, of different passive structures, like ligaments, capsule and
menisci, and of active structures like muscles. Nevertheless, these complex models
were unusable in physiological context for their computational weight. The logical
evolution of this approach could be the evaluation of a 3D model during the execution
of a motor task characteristic of daily living activity [13;14]. In this context, even if
the model is designed properly for a specific application, its potential can be nullified
by the errors resulting from the anatomical, geometrical and mechanical parameters
definition. In the cited papers [2;3;7-9;11-13], these errors were due to disagreement
in the origins of parameters and inputs, which were often obtained from different and
non-homogeneous sources.
Thus, in this work special attention was paid to the input data and parameter, in
particular to the geometry influencing mechanics. Subject specific geometries and
kinematic data are the foundations of the 3D quasi-static model adopted. The cruciate
ligament models took the twisting of the fibers into account and the reference length
of each fiber was estimated from the subject-specific passive flexion kinematics.
The aim of this study was the evaluation of the biomechanic role, in terms of
forces, of the anterior and the posterior cruciate ligaments during a step up/down
motor task.

2 Material and Methods
2.1 Subject and Experimental Acquisitions
The selected subject (male, height 168 cm, weight 62 kg, and age 30 years) underwent
a high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scan of his right knee with a
1.5T Gemsow scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) [14], as reported
in Table 1. The subject performed 2 repetitions of step up/down motor tasks while
acquired by means of fluoroscopy (SBS 1600, Philips Medical System Nederland
B.V.) at 10 images per second. The knee under analysis was kept inside the
fluoroscopic field of view during the execution of the selected task. Moreover, for the

detection of the subject specific fibers reference length [2;3], passive flexion was
performed with the help of a qualified operator and acquired by means of the same
fluoroscopic set-up.
2.2 Knee Geometrical Model
A 3D tiled surface geometrical representation of the distal femur, the proximal tibia,
and the insertion areas of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments was generated
from the NMR dataset using the software Amira (Indeed - Visual Concepts GmbH,
Berlin, Germany). For each NMR slice, the outer contour of the structures of interest
was detected and outlined with an entirely manual 2D segmentation technique. The
resulting stacks of contours were interpolated to generate polygonal surfaces of each
structure [14], as shown in Fig. 1(a-b).

respectively. Anterior view of the bony geometries and the ligament insertion areas (dotted
regions) on the femur and the tibia (c).

2.3 Ligament Geometrical Model
The anatomical insertion areas of both cruciate ligaments were described by a set of
points. These were also calculated by means of the software Amira as prints of the
ligament geometrical volume on the 3D bony surface, see Fig. 1(c). The inertia tensor
was calculated from each cloud of points, and its principal axes and planes were
calculated. The anatomical points were then projected on the first principal plane. A
quadratic equation for each planar insertion area was estimated to fit the contour line
of the projected anatomical points, and in each case an ellipse was obtained. The
planar insertion points were then selected uniformly mapping 25 points on these
elliptical areas. The 25 points were distributed: 1 in the centre of the ellipse, 12
uniformly distributed on the contour of the evaluated ellipse and 12 uniformly
distributed along the contour of an ellipse having the same centre and semi-axes half
of the previous one. The 25 planar insertion points selected on each elliptical area

834

were then fitted on the 3D anatomical insertion area using the “thin plate splines”
(TPS) method [15] as shown in Fig. 2(a).
The joining method between the femoral and tibial insertion points took the
anatomical twist of the ligament fibers into account. The anterior cruciate ligament
had the order of the fibers on the tibial insertion area rotated by 90° laterally with
respect to the femoral insertion area coherently with the anatomical external twist of
the ligament, see Fig. 2(b). The posterior cruciate ligament had the order of the fibers
on the tibial insertion area rotated by 90° medially with respect to the femoral
insertion area [16], see Fig. 2(c).

2.4 Kinematics
The accurate 3D bone pose in space was reconstructed by means of an iterative
procedure using a technique based on tangency condition between the projection lines
and the surface of the geometrical model. The accuracy of this technique was assessed
to be 1 degree for rotations and 1 mm for translations [17]. The passive flexion and
step up/down kinematics were then reconstructed.
2.5 Mechanical Ligament Properties
The two cruciate ligaments, in both models, were modeled with 25 different linearelastic elements. The elastic modulus E of each ligament was the same and it was
considered constant from literature equal to 175 MPa [3]. The reference length l0j of
each fiber j was defined according to Goodfellow’s hypothesis [18], as the maximal
length reached by each fiber during passive flexion. In a previous study, the authors
validated this technique using the drawer test along the anterior and the posterior
directions [19]. From the NMR dataset the total insertion area was known. The
relative cross-sectional area Aj for each fiber was calculated proportionally to the
distance of each modeled insertion point from its adjacent ones after the TPS
deformation on the anatomical surface.
The stiffness coefficient Kj was calculated for each fiber j with the equation (1)
where E, l0j and Aj were the variables mentioned above.

The force expressed from each fiber was shown in equation (2) where ΔLj was the
difference between instant length lj and the reference length l0j of the fiber.

F j = − K j ⋅ ΔL j

The total ligament force was the vectorial sum of all fiber forces of the ligament.
Obviously, the force expressed by each fiber was imposed to be zero if the distance
between its two insertions was smaller than the reference length.
2.6 Simulation and Post-processing Tools
The mechanical system, composed from the bony geometries and the ligaments
geometrical model including its mechanical properties, was implemented and
animated with the acquired experimentally kinematics in ADAMS/View 2005
(MSC.Software Corporation 2 MacArthur Place Santa Ana,CA 92707 USA). This
simulator of mechanical systems allowed to estimate each variable in the model, in
particular, for each relative position between the femur and the tibia. The three
components of the forces, anterior-posterior (A/P), proximal-distal (P/D) and mediallateral (M/L) NMR projections, and the magnitude for each fiber were calculated and
exported for both cruciate ligaments. Post-processing elaborations were computed
with Matlab 7 (The MathWorks, Inc, MA 01760-2098). The three components were
set to zero when the magnitude of the force of each fiber was positive (compression),
see equation (2). All these forces were transposed to the anatomical tibial reference
system.

3 Results
The global qualitative behavior of the posterior cruciate ligament was very similar
among the three anatomical directions, in particular considering the extension
movements. In the A/P and in the M/L components similar and bigger forces were
always reached than those reached in the P/D direction, see Fig. 3. The maximum
forces reached were three times bigger in the extension movements and over five
times bigger in the flexion movements.
In extension movements the mechanical contribution of the posterior cruciate
ligament was very limited from the full extension to about 30°-40° of flexion. Then a
rapid and quite linear increasing of its contribution was recorded until reaching the
maximum force until about 70° of flexion. At this angle of flexion a little decreasing
of the forces was observed, in particular in the P/D direction, see in Fig. 3(b).
The behavior of the two flexion movements was different with respect to each
other, in particular along the P/D direction. Like during the extension movements,
also in this case, very little forces were expressed from the full extension to a variable
angle at about 20°-40° of flexion. From this point, both two curves showed an
increasing of their contribution until reaching bigger maximum forces with respect to

836

those calculated in the extension movements. An isolated difference between the two
curves was clearly evident in the P/D direction, where one of these began to decrease
at about 45° of flexion, see Fig. 3(e).

4 Discussion
Anterior and posterior cruciate ligament models were implemented using geometrical
parameters and kinematics data from a single living subject. Regarding the posterior
cruciate, the greater repeatability obtained in the extension (step up movement) was
probably due to a major activity of the muscles for controlling the movement. These
had the goal to perform the movement against the gravity force and their concentric
contractions were more controlled by the nervous system. On the other hand the
flexion (step down movement) was an according to the gravity movement. Thus the
eccentric contraction of the muscles was less controlled and a minor repeatability was
obtained. The total inactivity of the anterior cruciate ligament was probably due to the
typology of the movement that tends to slack the anterior cruciate and to stretch the
posterior cruciate ligament. Indeed the biggest anatomical force components,
regarding the posterior cruciate ligament, were obtained along the A/P and the M/L
directions, where bigger contributions to the joint stabilization function were
necessary.
Although the linearity of the mechanical characteristic assumed for each ligament
fiber, the produced results were in agreement with physiology. In conclusion the
proposed model, including all experimental acquisitions and data elaborations, was
effective in evaluating subject-specific cruciate ligament loads during the execution of
daily living activities.
