Abstract. In this study, we report density functional theory calculations to
examine the effects of O3 adsorption on the field emission properties of capped
C(5,5) single-wall carbon nanotubes. Structural changes, adsorption energies,
and the first ionization potential for possible adsorption sites are discussed,
including an applied field in the calculations. The results suggest a suppression
of the emission upon O3 adsorption, explained by the charge transfer, while the
favored adsorption for the etched structures rationalizes enhancement due to
sharper tips upon opening of the carbon nanotube when ozonized, consistent
with experimental observations.

1 Introduction
Applications of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) could be enhanced, or
adversely affected, by surface adsorption, through non-covalent or covalent
interactions (covalent surface chemistry was recently reviewed [1]). In this work we
focus on the effects of surface adsorption on the field emission properties of carbon
nanotubes, which attracted considerable attention for use in applications such as
microwave amplifiers, X-ray sources, and flat panel displays, summarized [2], and
improved upon [3]. It is notable, however, that despite significant technological
developments, there are still unanswered questions, because the I-V characteristics
often deviate from Fowler-Nordheim’s relationship:

I = α Eeff2 exp(− β / Eeff )

(1)

where α is a constant related to the geometry, Eeff is the effective field at the emitter
tip, and β is proportional to the work function.

Effects of O3 Adsorption on the Emission Properties of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes

373

Indeed, changes in the field emission of SWCNTs due to geometrical and local
field effects were previously examined theoretically [4], while in our ongoing interest
to enhance field emission characteristics of SWCNTs, we investigated the effects of
Cs surface adsorption [5,6], which decreases the ionization potential (IP) of the
SWCNT. Most recently, enhanced field emission was observed for HfC-coated
carbon nanotubes, also attributed to the lower work function of HfC [7].
On the other hand, upon O2 adsorption, a decrease in the output current was noted
experimentally [8], consistent with our density functional theory (DFT) IP results [9],
demonstrating a suppression of the field emission, particularly when including the
effects of an electric field. At the same time, the effects of O3 adsorption at a
SWCNT tip have not yet been addressed theoretically, even though ozonized carbon
nanotubes are often present in samples due to purification procedures [1]. The field
emission characteristics upon ozonation were explored experimentally [10],
suggesting that the observed enhancement with a longer time treatment by ozone of
the sample, may be due to an opening of the carbon nanotube upon etching, resulting
in sharper tips, thus leading to a higher emission current. In this study we carried out
DFT calculations to study the effects of O3 on the adsorption and field emission
properties of SWCNTs.

2 Computational Details
2.1 Models
Calculations were performed by an all-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals
DFT approach, applying DMOL3 [11], with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [12]
exchange-correlation functional within the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA). A double numerical polarized basis set was used. The studied C(5,5) models
are shown in Figure 1 (70 C; 10 H, saturating the SWCNT at one end), with the
following adsorption sites: physisorption (config.-a); adsorption@h—h (config.-b);
adsorption@h—p (config.-c); etched structure of adsorption@h—p (config.-d). An
electric field was directed from above the tip to mimic the emission environment.
2.2 Computational Efficiency
DFT-based electronic structure calculations for molecular/periodic systems scale as
ca. O(N3), where N is the number of basis functions (bf). We carried out timings for
carbon nanotube model compounds, for one SCF iteration applying Gaussian03 [13]
(defined as: molecular geometry; guess density matrix; evaluate integrals; solve KS
equation) on a Compaq ES45, with up to 8100 bf. Calculations were carried out on 8
processors, and assuming linear scalability in this case, an O(N3.45) scaling was noted.
The serial efficiency of about 13% for an 180 atoms model (2700 bf’s), when running
on a 2GFlop processor, was consistent with NWChem results [14].
The bottlenecks in DFT include the electronic Coulomb problem, (x-c) quadrature,
and the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham (KS) matrix. Recent advances in
achieving “linear scaling” in DFT consist, for example, of methods to tackle the
Coulomb problem, based on the FMM, as reviewed [15], also by Beck [16],
summarizing real-space techniques in DFT. An O(N) real space technique has been
applied by Bernholc’s group [17].

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Parameters
Structural parameters of configurations (a)-(d) (Figure 1) are listed in Table 1. The
increase in the C—C bond length at the adsorption site by 15% and 16%, for the h—h
and h—p sites, respectively, demonstrated a weakening of the bonds upon O3
adsorption, being similar to our results for sidewall ozonation [18], but larger than for
O2 [9], which is consistent with the well known reactivity of ozone [19]. In addition,
a decrease of the bond angle in O3 by 16% upon adsorption was notable. In the etched
configuration, the dissociation of O3 forms two adsorption sites (config.-d), an etched
and an epoxide-type structure, for which an increase in the C—C bond distance of
about 10% was noted. Small structural changes were shown upon physisorption, and
the distance of O3 to the SWCNTs was calculated to be ca. 3.2Å. These results are
comparable to the results for the adsorption at the sidewall of a SWCNT [18].

3.2 Adsorption Energies
Our results showed a strong chemisorption of O3, with binding energies of -1.4 eV
and -0.74 eV for the h—h and h—p adsorption sites, respectively (Table 2). Most
notable is the stronger adsorption upon etching, namely for config.-d, characterized
by a higher adsorption energy (Ead=-2.77 eV), as compared to O2 adsorption (Ead=1.17 eV) [9]. These results are consistent with the O3 reactivity, and may explain the
enhancement of field emission for the etched sharp tips of the ozone treated carbon

nanotubes, as observed experimentally [10]. Indeed, in the presence of the electric
field, higher adsorption energies were obtained (Table 2), once again, consistent with
the experimental trend [10].
3.3 Ionization Potentials
The IP results indicate a slight increase upon ozonation, of about 1—2%,
comparable to our previous results for O2 adsorption [8], as well as for –COOH
modification [20]. We note that although only small changes were calculated in the
IPs upon O3 adsorption, a slightly larger effect could be expected with an increase
in O3 uptake. This was demonstrated by the IP results for 2O3@h—p and 2O3@h—
h (Figure 2), showing an increase of about 3%. In the presence of an applied field,
although the changes in the IPs for config.-c and config.–d were larger than for
config.-b (Table 2), variations are small overall, and the emission enhancement is
mostly due to the etching of the carbon nanotube tips [10]. The changes in the
HOMO values (Table 3) are consistent with the trend obtained for IPs, while
variations observed for the two different adsorption sites are being further
examined [18].

Mulliken population analyses show charge transfer to the adsorbed O3 moiety,
explaining the increase of the IP, as compared to pristine SWCNTs (Figure 2). A
larger charge transfer was obtained for two O3 adducts [18].

4 Conclusions
In this study, we report DFT calculations to examine the effects of O3 adsorption on
the field emission properties of capped C(5,5) single-wall carbon nanotubes. The first
ionization potential results, including an applied field in the calculations, for possible
adsorption sites, have shown a suppression of the emission upon O3 adsorption,
explained in terms of charge transfer, while the favored adsorption for the etched
structures rationalizes the enhancement due to sharper tips upon opening of the
carbon nanotube when treated with ozone for a long period of time, consistent with
experimental observations.
