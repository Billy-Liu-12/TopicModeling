Abstract. In this paper, we investigate eﬃcient approaches and algorithms for protecting multicast sessions against any single link failure
while establishing multicast sessions in WDM mesh networks. Since a
single failure may aﬀect whole nodes in a multicast group and causes
severe service disruption and a lot of traﬃc loss, protecting critical multicast sessions against link failure such as ﬁber cut becomes important
in WDM optical networks. One of the most eﬃcient algorithms is optimal path pair-shared disjoint paths (OPP-SDP). In this algorithm every
source-destination (SD) pair has the optimal path pair (working and protection path) between the source and destination node. Since degree of
sharing among the paths is essential to reduce the total cost and blocking probability, we propose the longest path ﬁrst-shared disjoint paths
(LPF-SDP) algorithm which decides the priority of selection among SD
pairs in a resource-saving manner. Our LPF-SDP is shown to outperform
over OPP-SDP in terms of degree of sharing and blocking probability.

Introduction

The growth of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology has opened
the gate for bandwidth-intensive applications [1]. In addition, the Internet services expand and multicast applications such as video conference, interactive
distance learning, and a large-scale online games become more popular [2]-[6].
In high-speed WDM networks it becomes more and more important to protect
multicast sessions against various types of failures. Therefore we propose longest
path ﬁrst-shared disjoint paths (LPF-SDP) which determines the order of selecting SD pairs appropriately. Our LPF-SDP algorithm is shown to achieve higher
performance compared to the OPP-SDP algorithm. This paper is organized as
follows. We propose multicast protection algorithms based on longest path ﬁrst
in Section 2. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithms is presented in
Section 3. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.

Proposed Multicast Protection Algorithms

In an attempt to improve performance we propose an LPF-SDP heuristic algorithm which determines the priority of selecting SD pairs in a cost-saving
manner. In our proposed LPF-SDP, for every destination node of a multicast
session, we ﬁnd an optimal path pair between a source and a destination node
successively, and update the link cost along the already-found optimal path pair
to zero. Since the cost of already-found optimal path pairs is updated to zero, the
probability of sharing the links increases, if the route is the longest one, resulting
in reduction of total cost. In this sense we propose the concept of longest path
ﬁrst order when the ﬁrst SD pair is selected. If the SD pair with the longest path
is established as the ﬁrst path pair, forthcoming working and protection pairs
can have more chance to share more links on the longest path. This mechanism
decreases the total cost for establishing multicast trees. After the ﬁrst path pair

randomly or sequentially. We call this algorithm The First Longest Path OnceShared Disjoint Paths (FLPO-SDP). Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 summarize the proposed
SPF-SDP and LPF-SDP algorithm.

Performance Evaluation

We evaluate and compare the performance of LPF-SDP with that of OPP-SDP,
FLPO-SDP, and SPF-SDP in terms of the total network cost on the sample
network with 24nodes and 43links. In our simulation, a multicast session of size
k is assumed to be established and protected. We repeat the experiment for
10,000 diﬀerent multicast sessions of the same size k of a multicast group. The
size of a multicast group k varies from 1 to 23 (unicast to broadcast).
Fig. 3 shows the average total cost versus session size k as the session size
increases in the sample network with 24 nodes and 43 links. Since the number
of links in the optimal path pairs increases as the session size increases, the
average total cost grows in general as the session size increases. We notice that
the LPF-SDP outperforms over the other schemes because this scheme results
in the best degree of sharing. The performance of LPF-SDP is about 6% higher
compared to the OPP-SDP algorithm.
Fig. 4(a) shows average total cost versus pe as pe increases in random networks
with 24 nodes. Since the number of links in random networks increases as pe
increases, the average cost decreases in general due to increased connectivity.
We also note that LPF-SDP outperforms among the schemes because the LPFSDP scheme inherits more degree of sharing. The performance of LPF-SDP is
about 5.4% higher compared to the OPP-SDP algorithm. And Fig. 4(b) shows
the average cost versus session size k as the session size increases in random
networks with 24 nodes. Since the number of links in the optimal path pairs
increases as the session size increases, the average cost increases as well.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed the LPF-SDP algorithm to eﬃciently solve the
multicast protection problem in WDM optical networks. The optimal solution
by ILP has very high complexity and requires large computational cost, and
OPP-SDP randomly determines the priority of selecting SD pairs. Our proposed
LPF-SDP is shown to be an eﬃcient algorithm to determine the priority of
selection among SD pairs appropriately. The simulation results both for static multicast sessions and for dynamic ones in the sample network and random
networks show that our LPF-SDP yields the least total network cost and the
blocking performance than OPP-SDP. The proposed LPF-SDP multicast protection scheme holds the property of resource-saving while providing survivability
for high-speed multicast applications in optical WDM networks.
