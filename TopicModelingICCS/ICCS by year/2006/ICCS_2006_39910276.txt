Abstract. Readthrough is an unusual translational event in which a stop codon
is skipped or misread as a sense codon. Translation then continues past the stop
codon and results in an extended protein product. Reliable prediction of
readthroughs is not easy since readthrough is in competition with standard
decoding and readthroughs occur only at a tiny fraction of stop codons in the
genome. We developed a program that predicts readthrough sites directly from
statistical analysis of nucleotides surrounding all stop codons in genomic
sequences. Experimental results of the program on 86 genome sequences
showed that 80% and 100% of the actual readthrough sites were found in the
top 3% and 10% prediction scores, respectively.

1 Introduction
Standard decoding of the genetic information is initiated from the start codon AUG
and terminated by any of the three stop codons UAG, UAA and UGA. But the
standard decoding rule can be changed occasionally by an event called ‘recoding’ [1].
A recoding event can occur during the elongation step (frameshift and hopping) or in
the termination step (readthrough) of translation [2, 3].
In the case of readthrough, reading the stop codon is suppressed since stop codons
are skipped or misread as sense codons. As a result, extended protein product is made
from the readthrough process (Fig. 1). The codon usage of the local sequence
surrounding stop codons is not random [4, 5], and in fact the sequence context around
the stop codon is the major determinant that affects the efficiency of the translation
termination [4, 5, 6, 7]. Namy et al. [8] showed ‘poor termination contexts’ that are
rarely used at general termination sites. In E. coli and S. cerevisiae, the upstream
sequence affects the termination efficiency [9]. The downstream sequence following
the stop codon also affects the termination efficiency [4]. Bonetti et al. [5]
demonstrated that translation termination is determined by synergistic interplay
between upstream and downstream sequences.
There were previous computational and/or statistical approaches to finding
readthrough sites in eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses [8, 10, 11, 12], but they are

not fully automated. Some approaches find readthrough contexts that match the wellknown readthrough context ‘CAA UAG CAA’ or ‘CAR YYA’ (Y is C or T, R is A or
G), but our study shows that there are more readthrough sites not conforming to the
context than those conforming to it.
We developed a fully automated program that finds readthrough sites directly from
genome sequences with no prior knowledge. It considers SORF (semi open reading
frame) and dORF (downstream open reading frame) in all three frames (-1, 0, +1) [10,
11]. We tested the program on 86 genome sequences from a number of organisms and
successfully found readthrough sites. The rest of the paper presents the method and its
experimental results in more detail.

Fig. 1. In the standard decoding, translation is terminated at the stop codon. In the readthrough
process, translation continues past the stop codon an extended protein product is produced.

2 Methods
2.1 Finding Readthrough Sites in Genome Sequences
Total 86 genome sequences were used as test data. 28 complete genome sequences of
virus were obtained from the GenBank database [13]. 34 complete genome sequence
and 24 complete coding sequences (CDSs) were obtained from the RECODE
database [14].
We defined ORF1 and ORF2 in the same way as Namy et al. [11]. ORF1 is the
area between the start codon and the first stop codon. ORF2 is the area between the
first stop codon and the second stop codon. In the work by Namy et al. [11] the
minimum length of ORF2 and the length between the first stop codon and the first
start codon of ORF2 are fixed. However, different organisms have different lengths
between the first stop codon and the first start codon of the second ORF. Our program
allows the user to choose the length (Fig. 3D), so it is flexible to find readthrough
sites of various organisms. Prediction of readthrough sites consists of five steps.
1. All genomic regions where two adjacent open reading frames (ORFs) are
separated by a stop codon are identified (see Fig. 2).
2. For the second stop codon, 10 nucleotide positions (1 upstream nucleotide, stop
codon and the following 6 nucleotides) are examined (colored region in Fig. 2).
3. Probabilities of A, C, G, and T are computed at each of the 10 positions, and the
position specific score matrix (PSSM) is constructed from the probabilities (Fig.

278

3E). A score is computed for the second stop codon by equation 1 using PSSM
and the probabilities of nucleotides.
4. If both ORFs do not have a start codon, the region is not considered as an open
reading frame and excluded from candidates.
5. Scores are sorted in increasing order. Sites with lower scores are better ones than
those with higher scores.

SORFs 2, 3, and n-1 are excluded since start codons do not exist in both ORF1 and ORF2.

2.2 Implementation
The program for finding readthrough sites was implemented in Microsoft C#. As
shown in Fig. 3A, stop codons of all three frames are examined by default, but the
user can choose the frame that he/her wants to analyze. The user can also adjust the
number of nucleotides surrounding a stop codon (Fig. 3B). Thus the user can compute
the probability of the upstream and downstream nucleotides irrespective of the
inclusion of stop codons (Fig. 3C). 10 in the first box of Fig. 3D indicates the
minimum length of ORF1, 600 in the second box indicates the maximum length
between the first stop codon and the first start codon of ORF2 and 10 in the third box

279

means the minimum length of ORF2. From the parameters in Fig. 3A-D, the position
specific score matrix is constructed (Fig. 3E). Based on our scoring scheme the scores
are sorted in increasing order (Fig. 3F). Because our program uses the data grid
control, the user can move data in Fig. 3E and F easily to Microsoft Excel or notepad
with the copy and paste operations. The user can also sort data by column titles. Fig.
3G shows the graphical view of the genome sequence. The user can see ORFs in all
frames and analyze them easily.

3 Results and Discussion
For the 86 genomic sequences we analyzed the average occurrence of each nucleotide
at positions -3 to +6 from every stop codon. When we consider all stop codons in the
genomic sequences, four nucleotides are observed in the positions with almost equal
frequency (Fig. 4). However, the frequencies dramatically change for the stop codons
in which readthroughs actually occur. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show sequence logos
visualized by WebLogo [15] for the 86 genomic sequences and for other 26

sequences, respectively. The sequences in both data sets are known to have
readthrough sites and obtained from RECODE.
Generally the role of the upstream codon for the stop codon efficiency is unclear. In
Fig. 5, the nucleotides in -2 upstream codon (positions -4, -5, and -6) are distributed
uniformly. In -1 upstream codon (positions -1, -2, and -3), nucleotide A is most
abundant. T and A are abundant in Fig. 5. Interestingly G is very rare at position -1
(2% and 4% in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively). Most previous work on readthrough
analyzed genomic sequences in terms of codons, but analysis in terms of nucleotides
seems necessary in studying readthrough.

Since G is very rare at -1 position, we examined the nucleotide at -1 position, a stop
codon and the next 6 nucleotides downstream the stop codon. Tables 1-3 show the
results of the analysis of stop codon readthrough. In the 86 sequences, total 23,735
(=6,416+7,343+10,154) stop codons were found. In Table 1, readthrough was not
predicted for Middleburg virus (GI number: 28193965, accession number:
AF339486). We obtained the complete CDS sequence of the virus from GenBank
hyperlinked by RECODE, but the sequence was different from that in the RECODE
database. We suppose the sequence (AF339486) does not have readthrough sites.

in the genome

It should be noted that only 0.36% (85 sites) of the total 23,735 stop codons are
actual readthrough sites, and the actual sites were found with high prediction scores.
23% and 80% (=23%+57%) of the actual readthroughs were included in the top 1%
prediction scores and 3% scores, respectively. All the actual readthroughs were found
within the top 10% scores (see Fig. 7). Interestingly, only 23 of the 85 actual
readthroughs conform to the well-known context ‘CAA UAG CAA’ or ‘CAR YYA’,
suggesting that the well-known context is not sufficient for finding readthrough sites.

4 Conclusion
Finding readthrough genes is important because the readthrough process is associated
with protein production and genetic control such as autoregulation. But prediction of

Prediction of Readthroughs Based on the Statistical Analysis

283

readthrough is very difficult because readthrough process is in competition with the
recognition as a sense codon and termination as a non-sense codon.
Based on codon preference and readthrough context, we have developed a program
that predicts candidate readthrough sites. Our program focused on -1 upstream
nucleotide, stop codon and 6 downstream nucleotides to find readthrough sites. The
program does not require any prior knowledge or manual work. It finds candidate
readthrough sites from the statistical analysis of genomic sequences only. The
program was tested on 86 genome sequences and successfully predicted all known
actual readthrough sites. If the user provides the information of the approximate ORF
length, the prediction can be done more efficiently. We believe this is the first fully
automated program capable of predicting readthrough sites.
