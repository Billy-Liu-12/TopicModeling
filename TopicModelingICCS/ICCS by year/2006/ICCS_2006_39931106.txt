Abstract. We ﬁnd the structural eﬀect in geographical networks on the
optimal paths and on the robustness of the connectivity. The communication eﬃciency are measured by the average path lengths and hops in
the typical planar networks: Delaunay triangulation, random Apollonian
network, and our proposed model with the well-balanced properties. The
dynamic conﬁguration will be useful especially for ad hoc communication.

Introduction

Complex networks have been studied with great interest inspired from physics to
biology, computer science, and other ﬁelds, since the surprisingly common topological structure called small-world (SW) or scale-free (SF) has been found in many
real systems [1]. It has good properties in the meanings of economical and eﬃcient communication by small number of hops in a connected network with a few
links [2] and of the robustness against failure [3]. Moreover, the restriction of link
lengths has been observed, e.g. Internet at both router and AS levels [4], road networks, and ﬂight-connection in a major airline [5]. Indeed, the distribution of link
lengths was inversely proportional to the lengths [4] or exponentially decayed [6].
In other words, the length is not equal but various in a space, therefore some longrange links are more dominant to the shortest path whose distance is deﬁned by a
sum of the link lengths on the path between two nodes. This situation called disorder has been recently studied in complex networks [7],[8]. On the other hand,
although eﬃcient transport of packets, passengers, supplies, or other quantities
depends on both the topology and routing methods [9], there are local rules to
ﬁnd the optimal paths in a special class of networks such as planar graphs.
In this paper, we consider geographical SF network models for a number
of research ﬁelds including urban planning, electric circuits, distributed robots,
sensor networks, communication networks, and so on. In particular, we discuss
dynamic conﬁguration of planar networks for ad hoc communication. The planarity is important to avoid interference of the wireless beam, or to construct
communication lines on the surface of earth.
In the state-of-the-art studies, a few geographical SF network models have
been known with theoretical analyses in the evolutional mechanisms of powerlaw behavior. They are categorized into three classes: the modulated Barab´
asiAlbert (BA) model by a penalty of the distance for connecting nodes [10],[11], SF

networks embedded in lattices [12],[13], and space-ﬁling networks [14],[15],[16].
A brief review of these models has been reported [6]. Unfortunately, crossing of
links exist except for the third class. On the other hand, as a typical model in
the third class, a random Apollonian network (RA) has some long-range links
which cause dissipation of the beam power or the construction cost of links,
although it is based on planar triangulation without crossing of links. Thus, to
reduce long-range links, we consider a modiﬁcation of RA preserving the good
properties of SF structure on a planar space. We investigate the shortest paths
with weak disorder and ﬁnd the universal scaling laws. Moreover, the robustness
against the attacks on hubs is improved.

Models of Ad Hoc Networks
Planar Triangulation

Planar triangulation is a mathematical abstraction of ad hoc networks, in which
the positions of nodes are temporarily ﬁxed as base stations of backbone networks. Thus, the mobility of node is out of our scope to simplify the discussion.
On such graphs, online routing algorithms [17] that guarantee delivery of messages using only local information about positions of the source, destination,
and the adjacent nodes to a current node in the routing have been developed.
To ﬁnd a path through exploration is required in many cases, since knowledge
about the environment in which routing takes place is not available beforehand,
especially in dynamic conﬁgurations with evolution. In any case, the optimal
path depends on both topological and spatial network structures, as measures
of the communication eﬃciency, the number of hops for transfer of a message
and the path length in the Euclidean distance are crucial.
On the other hand, Delaunay triangulation (DT), which is the dual of a
Voronoi diagram, is the optimal planar triangulation in some geometric criteria
[18] with respect to the maximin angle and the minimax circumcircle of triangle
on a two-dimensional space, and widely used in practical applications for facility
locations and computer graphics [19]. It is well-known as a good property that
the shortest path length between any two nodes on a Delaunay graph is of the
same order as the direct Euclidean distance, since the ratio of the path length to
the direct distance is bounded by a constant [20]. However, the average number
of hops on that graph is unknown. One of the fundamental techniques for equipping such properties is diagonal ﬂipping. In the Delaunay triangulation, diagonal
ﬂips are globally applied to the triangles until the minimum angle of triangle is
not increased by the exchange of diagonal links in a quadrilateral. Such global
process is unsuitable for ad hoc networks. In contrast, RA can be constructed
by local procedures for the subdivision of a randomly chosen triangle, although
it has some long-range links. Thus, we compare the communication eﬃciency
measured by the average path length and hops in the typical network models
based on planar triangulation: DT in computer science, RA in complex network
science, and our modiﬁcation to bridge them.

2.2

Delaunay-Like SF Network

We brieﬂy explain a random Apollonian network (RA) [14] constructed from an
initial triangulation of a polygon as follows. At each time step, a triangle is randomly chosen, and a new node is added inside the triangle and linked to its three
nodes. We assume the new node is set at the barycenter of the chosen triangle.
The topological properties of power-law degree distribution, large clustering coeﬃcient, disassortative degree-degree correlation, and the average small number
of the minimum hops on paths between any two nodes have been theoretically
and numerically analyzed [14],[15],[16]. Although RAs have the several advanced
SF properties and the SW eﬀect with a small diameter of graph, some long-range
links naturally appear near the boundary edges. To reduce the long-range links,
we propose a modiﬁed model from RAs. The main idea is based on a strategy for
connecting nodes in distances as short as possible by adding with the diagonal
ﬂips in DTs. The proposed network is grown as follows.
Step 0: Set an initial planar triangulation in a space.
Step 1: Select a triangle at random and add a new node at the barycenter.
Then, connect the new node to its three nodes. Moreover, by iteratively
applying diagonal ﬂips, connect it to the nearest node (or more than one of
the neighbor nodes) within a radius deﬁned by the distance between the new
node and the nearest node of the chosen triangle.
Step 2: The above process is repeated until the required size N is reached.
We have two variations with one nearest node and all neighbors in the local circle,
whereas the diagonal ﬂips are globally applied in DTs. Note that these nodes
are limited to the connected ones by applying iterative diagonal ﬂips. We call
our model RA+NN(one/all) that means the combination with the triangulation
in RAs and the rewiring to the one or all Nearest Neighbors denoted in the
parentheses.
Fig. 1 illustrates the linking procedures by iterative diagonal ﬂips: in a quadrilateral that consists of the shaded triangles, the long-range (cross) link is diagonally exchanged to the red link for maximizing the minimum angle of triangle.
The dashed lines are new links from the barycenter, and form new ﬁve triangles
with contours in the left of Fig. 1; The intersected black solid links with dashed
ones are removed after the 2nd ﬂips. Thus, the concentrate of links to hubs is

Eﬃciency for Communication
Approximative Analysis of the Degree Distribution

The degree distribution is one of the important statistical characteristics related
to the SF properties. We approximately derive the exponential decaying in the
tail of degree distribution for the proposed network model. The occurrence of
cutoﬀs also observed in real networks [21] is rather natural from the constraint
on addition of new links.
When some links are removed from a node by multiple diagonal ﬂips as shown
in Fig. 1, the dynamical equation of the number of nodes n(k, N ) with degree k
at the size N is given by
n(k + 1, N + 1) =

k+1
k
n(k, N ) + 1 −
NΔ
NΔ

n(k + 1, N ) − a

n(k + 1, N ),
NΔ

where NΔ and a denotes the number of triangles and the average rate of the multiple diagonal ﬂips, respectively. The 1st and 2nd terms in the r.h.s correspond
to the preferential attachment through random selection of a triangle, and the
3rd term is the statistical rewiring eﬀect by multiple diagonal ﬂips. Note that
there is no other reason for decreasing the degree. We neglect the other eﬀects
such as additional links to nodes with low degrees, because we focus on the tail
of degree distribution.
By using P (k) = n(k, N )/N , we have
NΔ + N
P (k + 1) + k(P (k + 1) − P (k)) + akP (k + 1) = 0.
N
def

From the continuous approximation dp/dk ≈ P (k + 1) − P (k) and γ = (NΔ +
N )/N , it is rewritten as
dp
= −(γ + ak)p.
k
dk
Thus, we obtain the solution p(k) ∼ k −γ exp(−ak) for large N . Note that in
RAs a power law with the exponent γRA ≈ 3 has been similarly derived [14].
Fig. 3(a) shows the agreement of our approximation with the observed degree
distribution. The cumulative rate a is numerically estimated by the average
convergent value as shown in Fig. 3(b). Note that the time step t is equivalent
to the network size N , because a new node is added at each time. Each network
model is investigated in the averaging of 100 random realizations at the size
N = 1, 000 generated from the initial triangulation of a square graph.

3.2

Weak Disorder in the Distribution of Link Lengths

In the studies of the optimal path in disordered complex networks [7],[8], each
link length is associated with a weight assumed by exp(δε), where the parameter δ controls the strength of disorder, and ε is a random number taken form
a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. As a network approaches the strong
disorder limit at δ → ∞, only the longest link becomes dominant in the shortest
path length deﬁned by the smallest sum of link lengths on a path between two
nodes. At the limit, the scaling relations of the average shortest path length
D ∼ N 1/3 for γ > 4 and D ∼ N (γ−3)/(γ−1) for 3 < γ ≤ 4 has been theoretically predicted [7] from the percolation on SF networks [22]. Although the
relation is unknown for 2 < γ ≤ 3 because of the singularity in the analysis at
γ = 3, D ∼ (ln N )γ−1 has been also numerically suggested [7].
However, the assumption of length distribution may be violated on a geometric
space, in addition the strong disorder limit is an extreme case. Thus, to investigate the strength of disorder in RAs, DTs, and the proposed networks, we compare the length distributions. Fig. 4 shows the distribution P (lij ) of link length
lij in each network. The dashed lines with an equal gap from top to bottom are
corresponded to the distributions of weight 2 exp(δε)/ exp(δ) for δ = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
respectively. The factor 2/ exp(δ) is due to the normalization for the maximum
length of the boundary edge. We ﬁnd that RAs and RA+NN(one/all)s have
weak disorder with small δ [8], while DTs have a slightly broad range of disorder
as similar to the exponential decay in the domestic airline ﬂight-connection [6].

Shortest Path Lengths and Minimum Hops

We investigate the average distance of path length D on the shortest paths,

Fig. 4. The distribution of link
lengths with weak disorder

L on these paths, and the number of hops L on the shortest paths between
any two nodes. Figs. 5(a)(b) show the SW eﬀect. Note that the shortest path
and the path of the minimum hops may be distinct, these measures are related
to the link cost or delay and the load for transfer of a message. It is better to
shorten both the distance and the number of hops, however their constraints are
generally conﬂicted.
As in Table 1, we ﬁnd the scaling relations estimated by straight lines for the
sizes N = 500, 1, 000, 3, 000, 5, 000 and 10, 000. We remark that the values of βd
and βd diﬀer from γ − 1 ≈ 2 numerically suggested at the strong disorder limit
[7], although the values of βl and βl are relatively close to it. The weak disorder
may aﬀect these diﬀerences. In addition, the values of αl and αl are close to
1/3 predicted at the limit [7] for the Erd¨
os-R´enyi (ER) model as the classical
random network and the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model as a SW network. The
nearest αl in DT is probably caused by that the lognormal degree distribution
resembles the unimodal shapes in ER and WS models rather than a power-law.

Tolerance to Failure or Attack

The fault tolerance and attack vulnerability are known as the typical SF properties [3]. We compare the tolerance of connectivity in the giant component (GC)
of RAs, DTs, and RA+NN(one/all)s, when a small fraction f of the nodes is removed. Fig. 6(a) shows the similar results of the relative size S/N for the fraction
of random failures, where S denotes the size of GC. Against the attacks on hubs
selected in the decreasing order of degrees, Fig. 6(b) shows the improvements in
RA+NN(one/all)s from the extremely vulnerable RAs caused at an early stage
by the disconnection of star-like stubs concentrated at the four corners and the
center nodes as shown in Fig. 2. Note that the weakly inhomogeneous DT is
diﬀerent from a homogeneous random network, which has the same behavior
against the failure and the attack at a fraction of removed nodes [3].

Conclusion

We study the communication eﬃciency of geographical networks called RA
[14],[15] and DT [18],[19] based on planar triangulation for ad hoc networks
[17]. In particular, to reduce long-range links, we propose a modiﬁed model
whose degree distribution follows a power-law with exponential cutoﬀ. We ﬁnd a
weak disorder in the distributions of link lengths. Even in the weak disorder, we
suggest the scaling laws of the shortest path length D ∼ (ln N )βd and of the
minimum hop L ∼ N αl as similar to the case at the strong disorder limit [7].
From the simulation results, we conclude that RAs have a path connected by
a few hops but the path length becomes long including some long-range links,
while DTs have a zig-zag path connected by many hops but each link is short.
Instead of the superior geometric properties [18], DTs are no longer optimal in
this criteria of the minimum hops. Our model is totally balanced: the shortest

Geographical Construction of Scale-Free Networks

1113

path length is the best, in addition the number of hops is the intermediate between ones in DTs and RAs. Moreover, by the structural eﬀect, the robustness
against the attacks on hubs is improved than that in RAs. Although DTs are
the most robust in these network models, only it requires global conﬁguration
procedures that is unsuitable for ad hoc communication.
