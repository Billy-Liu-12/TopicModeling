Abstract. This paper discusses an adaptive modulation technique combined
with space-frequency block coded OFDM(SFBC OFDM) over frequency
selective channels and evaluates the performance in terms of the outdated
channel state information(CSI) in mobile environments. This paper employs the
Alamouti’s diversity scheme in multiple input multiple output OFDM (MIMO
OFDM) and an adaptive modulation with enhanced performance. Through the
various simulations, the performance of SFBC OFDM employing adaptive
modulation is compared with the performance of fixed modulation. Also, in
adaptive modulation scheme, the effects of the outdated CSI under mobile
environments are shown

1 Introduction
In order to improve the performance of OFDM system in frequency selective and
multipath fading environments, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation
combined with SFBC OFDM. The perfect CSI ensures a desired efficiency/
performance of adaptive modulation scheme. In MIMO OFDM system, by making
use of SVD the MIMO channel on each subcarrier is decomposed into parallel noninterfering single input single output(SISO) channels. But, a SFBC OFDM system
with Alamouti’s diversity scheme in [1] does not require the SVD for the CSI.
Assuming the availability of the perfect CSI at the transmitter, the performance gains
of adaptive modulation have been demonstrated. This paper examines the impact on
performance of an adaptive OFDM system, which combined with SFBC scheme, due
to the outdated CSI in mobile fading channel.

2 Adaptive Space Frequency Block Coded OFDM
This paper considers a MIMO OFDM system employing the Alamouti’s diversity
scheme in Fig 1. To begin with, let H ij (n) be the following diagonal matrix whose

diagonal elements are the frequency responses of the channel impulse responses hij
between the i-th transmit antenna and the j-th receive antenna during the n-th time slot
H ij (n) = diag[ H ij (n, 0) " H ij (n, N − 1)],

i = 1, 2, j = 1, 2

The data symbol vector X(n) is coded into two vectors X1 (n) and X 2 (n) by the
space-frequency encoder block as

X1 (n) = [ X (n,0) − X ∗ (n,1) " X (n, N − 2) − X ∗ (n, N − 1)]T
X 2 (n) = [ X (n,1)

Let Y j (n) be the n-th received OFDM symbol from the j-th receive antenna. The receive
symbol vector can be represented by the even and odd component vectors as follows
Y j , e (n) = H1 j , e (n) X1, e (n) + H 2 j , e (n) X 2, e (n) + W j , e (n),

j = 1, 2.

Y j , o (n) = H1 j , o (n) X1, o (n) + H 2 j , o (n) X 2, o (n) + W j , o (n),

In this paper, we consider the bit allocation scheme in [3]. Assume M-QAM is
employed for each subcarrier, b( n, k ) bits per symbol are sent for the k-th subcarrier
in the n-th OFDM symbol. According to [4][5], given the channel frequency response
H (n, k ) , the instantaneous bit error rate(BER) can be approximated by

Let us consider the bit allocation in SFBC OFDM system. From the equation (4), the
decoupled CSI for bit allocation is as follows

By substituting H (n, k ) into H (n, k ) in equation (5), the bit allocation for SFBC
OFDM is performed and the next procedures for complete bit allocation are based on
Chow’s method.

3 Simulation Results
The parameters of adaptive OFDM system are as follows. Carrier frequency is 2GHz
and the channels bandwidth is 20MHz which is divided equally among 2048 tones.
The channel is based on COST 207 for a hilly terrain area [6] and the SISO channels
associated with different couples of transmit/receive antennas are statistically
equivalent and independent. The RMS delay spread is 5μs. A total of 4096
information bits transmitted in each OFDM frame The velocity of mobile station is
60km/h. We allocate 0, 2, 4, or 6 bits to each subcarrier. To compare with adaptive
OFDM, the conventional OFDM scheme, called as an uniform OFDM, is uniformly
modulated by 16-QAM. For the simulation according to feedback delay TΔ , the
minimum feedback delay is 81μs and the maximum delay is 810μs.

Let us consider the question of how the performance of adaptive OFDM system
with diversity scheme appears in mobile fading environments. Fig. 2 indicates that the
feedback delay has an effect on the performance of adaptive SFBC OFDM with
2Tx/1Rx antenna scheme. As expected, the BER is gradually degraded as the feedback
delay increases. This performance degradation is due to unavailability of CSI at the
transmission time. Let us examine that an adaptive OFDM system employing spacefrequency block coding scheme is one of ways how to overcome the effects of
feedback delay. Fig. 3 indicates the simulation result when the feedback delay is 324μs
and 810μs, respectively. An adaptive OFDM system with 1Tx-1Rx scheme needs the
additional power more than about 7 dB. It is shown that there is no merit of adaptive
1Tx-1Rx OFDM when feedback delay is long. On the other hand, in case of 2Tx-1Rx
scheme, adaptive SFBC OFDM systems need the additional power of about 1dB and

3dB, respectively. We can see that adaptive OFDM system employing a diversity
scheme mitigates the effect of feedback delay. From this result, the performance
degradation of adaptive OFDM due to the outdated CSI can be mitigated by diversity
technique and we can refer the adaptive 2Tx-2Rx SFBC OFDM as an excellent system
which have scarcely power loss in spite of severe feedback delay.

4 Conclusions
In this paper combining an adaptive bit allocation scheme with SFBC OFDM system
has been discussed. It has been illustrated that the CSI from SVD of MIMO channel is
identical to the CSI from SFBC OFDM. From the various simulations, the performance
of adaptive SFBC OFDM has been evaluated. Particularly, the BER performances
according to the feedback delay have been indicated in detail. In the results, it is very
interesting that the diversity schemes mitigate the effect of long feedback delay for
adaptive OFDM. Most of all, adaptive SFBC OFDM with 2Tx-2Rx antenna scheme
has made an excellent performance in spite of a severe feedback delay.
