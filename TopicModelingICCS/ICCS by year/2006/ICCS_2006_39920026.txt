Abstract. We model and simulate numerically a droplet impact onto a
solid substrate. The triple line dynamics modelling is implicit (as opposed
to classical explicit mobility relations), it is based on the Shikhmurzaev
equations. These equations include generalized Navier slip type boundary
conditions with extra local surface tension gradient terms. Numerical
results when spreading and recoiling are presented. A particular attention
is paid to ﬂow patterns near the contact line.

Introduction

One of the main diﬃculty to simulate present droplet ﬂows is the contact line
dynamics modelling. This problem has been widely studied and still remains an
open problem. Let us cite macroscopic models with slip boundary conditions,
see [4], [5], [3], mesoscopic models with diﬀuse interface, see [6] and also [9], and
connection with molecular dynamics, see [11]. The most frequent contact line
model is an explicit mobility relation giving the contact line velocity in function
of the wetting angle value at any time (Tanner type laws). Nevertheless, it has
been showed, [2], that the dynamic wetting angle cannot be determined inherently by such a mobility relation.
In the present paper, we consider an ”implicit” model based on the
Shikhmurzaev theory, [10], [2]. This model lead to generalized Navier slip type
boundary conditions with local surface tension gradient terms. It does not impose the contact line velocity nor the wetting angle since they are a response
of the full model. In Section 2, we present the equations: 2D axi-symmetric
Navier-Stokes equations with an ALE formulation. In Section 3, we discretize
the equations using a ﬁnite element scheme. We introduce a contact line algorithm which imitates caterpillar motion observed in experiments. Curvature is
computed using a local Bezier least-square approximation. In Section 4, ﬁrst we
consider a Tanner type law and we test the robustness of our algorithm. Then, we
consider both spreading phase and recoiling phase, using the present ”implicit”
model based on the Shikhmurzaev theory. The extra local terms appearing in
this model are setted by preliminary results presented in [7] and [8]. We show
diﬀerent ﬂow patterns generated by these terms near the triple point. Finally,
we obtain encouraging results for both phases.

Mathematical Model
Equations

The droplet dynamics is modelled by the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations 2D axi-symmetric. We denote by u = (ur , uz )T the ﬂuid velocity, p
its pressure, Σ the stress tensor, D the deformation tensor and Re the Reynolds
number. We denote by (τ , n) the unit tangential and external normal vectors
such that it is direct. We set: Σn = Σ.n; Σn = Σn n+Στ τ . The r-momentum
equations with ALE formulation is:

where Ca is the Capillary number, κ is the mean curvature and pext is the
external pressure. The extra term h is given (see Shikhmurzaev’s theory below).
We have classical boundary conditions on the symmetry axis. We decompose the
liquid-solid interface into two parts: Γad and Γsl . Γsl denotes a ”small” part of
the liquid-solid interface near the triple point. We consider a generalized Navier
slip type boundary condition (local slipping):
u.n =
0
in (0, T ) × Γsl
Στ = −[βu + g].τ in (0, T ) × Γsl

(3)

where β is a given sliding coeﬃcient. The extra term g is given, it models either
a surface tension gradient in the Shikhmurzaev’s theory or a uncompensated
Young stress in the Qian-Wang-Sheng theory, see below. On Γad , we impose
adherence boundary conditions: u = 0. The free surface Γf is transported by u,

it is described by a function φ(t, r(t), z(t)). We have:

Contact Line Dynamics Modelling

We consider two diﬀerent types of model for the contact line dynamics: an explicit model (Tanner type law) and an ”implicit” one deriving from Shikhmurzaev
theory.
Mobility relation (Tanner type Law). The contact line velocity and the wetting
angle are related by:
UCL (t) = k

(θ(t) − θeq )γ
for t ∈]0, T [
(θeq )γ

(4)

28

J. Monnier and I. Cotoi

where UCL is the contact line velocity, θeq is the wetting angle at equilibrium
(Young’s law), θ is the (dynamic) wetting angle. k and γ are parameters usually
determined using experimental results.
Local ﬂow modelling and Shikhmurzaev’s theory. The “implicit” model does
not impose the contact line velocity and the wetting angle but consider them
as a response of the model. This model is based on the Shikhmurzaev’s theory,
[10], [2], which makes introduce the generalized Navier slip condition (3) and the
condition (2). These conditions are local since the extra terms g and h vanish
except in a vicinity of the triple point. The basic idea of this theory is to consider
that the rolling motion observed in experiments, [4], implies that particles of the
liquid-gas interface become an element of the solid-liquid in a ﬁnite time. Then,
the surface tension value associated to this particle must change to its new
equilibrium value relative to the solid-liquid interface. This process would gives
rise to a surface tension gradient in a small vicinity of the advancing contact line
(hence a local Marangoni eﬀect). In other respect, the Young equation would
remain valid at any time. In this theory,

where σ and σLG are the liquid-solid and the liquid-gas surface tension coeﬃcient respectively. In [7] and [8], a mathematical and numerical study presents
some qualitative behaviors of g and h arising from Shikhmurzaev’s theory.
A connection with Qian-Wang-Sheng theory. From molecular dynamics simulations on immiscible ﬂuids, [11] shows that the relative slipping between the
ﬂuid and the solid wall follows a generalized Navier slip b.c. similar to (3) (if
one phase ﬂuid only is considered). In this theory, the extra term g in (3) would
model an interfacial uncompensated Young stress. The extra tangential stress g
is deﬁned as follows: Γint g dy = σ(cosθ − cosθeq ), where Γint dy denotes the
integral across the interface Γf .

Discretization and Algorithms
Finite Element Scheme

We discretize the full model in time using the Euler implicit scheme and a ﬁrst
order characteristic method. The space discretization is done using the second
order Taylor-Hood ﬁnite element. The scheme is implemented using a public
C++ ﬁnite element library. To compute the curvature , ﬁrst we consider a second
order local Bezier least-square approximation of points deﬁning the interface,
second we evaluate the curvature of the Bezier curve. We performed numerical
tests which showed that this method ﬁlters noise quite reasonably while it allows
to detect local and rapid variation of curvature.

The ALE Free Surface Algorithm

The free surface problem is solved using an ALE formulation and a characteristic
method. The algorithm is the following. At time step n, given Ω n and (un , pn )

Spreading and Caterpillar Motion

When spreading, our algorithm imitates the caterpillar motion observed in experiments, [4]. Fig. 5 (Left) represents typical successive time steps. If at time
step n, the ﬁrst point (or several points) on the free surface are projected on the
solid substrate, all the points on the solid wall but the last ones become no-slip
points. The last two points remain slip point.
3.4

Recoiling Motion

When de-wetting (recoiling), the triple point and the slip points are allowed to
move horizontally, also vertically if their vertical velocity is positive, see Fig. 5
(Right). If the triple point moves away from the solid wall, the ﬁrst point to the
left becomes the triple point, hence becoming a free point. The second point to
the left becomes a slip point.

Spreading Phase Using a Tanner Type Law

We start by testing the eﬃciency of the algorithm. To this end, we consider
the Tanner type law as triple line dynamic modelling, and we make ﬁt this law
with available experimental data, [1], related to a spreading phase. The triple
point position is imposed at each time. We focus on the volume conservation,
the height and diameter of the spreading (splat radius) and the deformation
of the mesh (number of re-meshing necessary), see Fig. 2. With a time step
dt = 5.10−5s and a coarse mesh (≈ 600 elements), volume lost after 650 iterations
is roughly 3%. The loss occurs mainly at the very beginning of spreading. Mesh
transport is eﬃcient hence re-meshing occurs only when a projection occurs (see
previous section). From a qualitative point of view, numerical results are similar
to experimental data, [1].
4.2

Inﬂuence of the Local Parameters (β, g, h)

We present some inﬂuence of terms speciﬁc to the Shikmurzaev’s model by considering the following steady-state Stokes system: Find (u, p) such that:

for a high β value, the eﬀect of this term will be similar to a no-slip/slip boundary condition on Γsl . For the g-term, it is clear that a high |g| will be equivalent
to accelerating/decelarating the spreading. The h-term creates an upward force
which should be responsible for recoiling, see Fig. 3, for β = 100 and diﬀerent
values of g and h.
4.3

Spreading Phase Using the Shikhmurzaev Model

We consider the spreading phase using the Shikhmurzaev’s model and the algorithm presented previously. As mentioned above, g acts like a control on the
position of the triple point. A decrease for g < 0 translates in a faster spreading.
If g is small, this inﬂuence is likely not to be seen in the ﬁrst part of the spreading, when the inertial forces dominate all other forces in presence. By increasing

|g| over a threshold, which depends on β, it accelerates the spreading and modiﬁes the ﬂow nature. For |g| large, large interface distortions occurs and mesh
generator fails to re-mesh. In order to observe the inﬂuence of the g-term, we ﬁx
β = 1000, and we perform 1000 iterations with a step size of dt = 5.0 × 10−6 for
g ∈ {−100, −10, −1}, Fig. 4. One can observe that after the inertial phase, the
triple point position is farther to the right with a decreasing g.
4.4

Recoiling Phase Using the Shikhmurzaev Model

We consider the recoiling phase using the Shikhmurzaev model and the algorithm
presented previously. Parameters are as follows: (β, g, h) = (100, 100, −20) and
(500, 100, −20). As expected, the h-term controls the separation of the triple
point from the solid surface, see Fig. 5, while the g-term helps the droplet to
slide toward the symmetry axis. Combination of both lead to a recoiling motion.
Let us precise that we observed the onset of free surface instabilities. A method
to deal with these instabilities is under investigation.

Conclusion

We have discretized and implemented macroscopic part of the Shikhmurzaev
model, [10], [2], using an ALE formulation and a ﬁnite element scheme. Also,
a connection with Qian-Wang-Sheng’s results, [11], is presented. The present
model comprises generalized Navier slip boundary conditions with local surface
tension gradient terms in the vicinity of the contact line. The local term values
have been chosen upon a previous mathematical and numerical study done in
[8]. To test the eﬃciency of the present algorithm, ﬁrst we considered a classical
mobility relation and we obtained spreading droplet proﬁles qualitatively comparable to experimental results. Then, we showed how the introduction of these
new local terms in the vicinity of the contact line allow to model on one hand the
spreading phase, on the other hand the recoiling phase. A full coupling between
the macroscopic part and the microscopic part of the Shikhmurzaev model is
under progress.
