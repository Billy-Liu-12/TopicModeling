Abstract. The paper deals with the local sensitivity analysis of the
discrete-time inﬁnite-horizon H 2 estimation problem. An improved, nonlinear sensitivity estimate is derived which is less conservative than the
existing, condition number based sensitivity estimates.

Introduction

In the last four decades the H 2 (Wiener-Kalman) estimators have been widely
used in numerous applications in signal processing and control. However, the
computational and robustness aspects of the H 2 estimation problem have not
been studied in a suﬃcient extent and the eﬃcient and reliable H 2 estimator
design and implementation is still an open problem.
In this paper we study the local sensitivity of the discrete-time inﬁnite-horizon
H 2 estimation problem [1] relative to perturbations in the data. Using the nonlinear perturbation analysis technique proposed in [2, 3] and further developed
in [4, 5], we derive a new, nonlinear local perturbation bound for the solution of
the matrix Riccati equation that determines the sensitivity of the H 2 estimation problem. The new sensitivity estimate is a ﬁrst order homogeneous function
of the data perturbations and is less conservative than the existing, condition
number based linear sensitivity estimates [6] - [12].
The following notations are used later on: R is the ﬁeld of real numbers;
Rm×n is the space of m × n matrices over R; AT ∈ Rn×m is the transpose
of A = [aij ] ∈ Rm×n ; In is the identity n × n matrix; vec(A) ∈ Rmn is the
2
2
column-wise vector representation of the matrix A ∈ Rm×n ; Πn2 ∈ Rn ×n is
T
n×n
; · 2
the vec-permutation matrix, so that vec(A ) = Πvec(A) for all A ∈ R
and · F are the spectral and Frobenius norms in Rm×n , while · is the
induced operator norm or an unspeciﬁed matrix norm. The Kronecker product
of the matrices A, B is denoted by A ⊗ B and the symbol := stands for “equal
by deﬁnition”.

Problem Statement

Consider the linear discrete-time model
xi+1 = F xi + Gui
yi = Hxi + vi ,

−∞ < i < ∞

(1)

si = Lxi
where F ∈ Rn.n , G ∈ Rn.m , H ∈ Rp.n , and L ∈ Rq.n are known constant
matrices, xi is the state, yi is the measured output, si is the desired signal, and
{ui }, {vi } are zero-mean white-noise processes with variance matrices Q ≥ 0
and R > 0, respectively. It is assumed that the pair (F, H) is detectable and the
pair (F, GQ1/2 ) – stabilizable.
Given the observations {yj , j ≤ i}, the H 2 estimation problem [1] consists in
ﬁnding a linear estimation strategy sˆi|i = F (y0 , y, y1 , . . . , yj ) that minimizes the
expected ﬁltered error energy, i.e.,
i

(sj − sˆj|j )T (sj − sˆj|j ).

min E
F

j=0

As it is well known [1], in the inﬁnite-horizon case the H 2 estimation problem
is formulated as
min
causal K(z)

[(L(zI − F )−1 G − K(z)H(zI − F )−1 G)Q1/2

− K(z)R1/2 ]

2

and its solution is given by
K(z) = LP H T (R + HP0 H T )−1
+ L(I − P H T (R + HP0 H T )−1 H)(zI − Fp )−1 Kp
where Kp = F P0 H T Re−1 , Re = R+HP0 H T , and P0 ≥ 0 is the unique stabilizing
(Fp = F − Kp H stable) solution of the matrix Riccati equation
F P F T − P + GQGT − Kp Re KpT = 0.

(2)

A state-space model for K(z) can be given by
x
ˆi+1 = F x
ˆi + Kp (yi − H x
ˆi )
xi + LP H T Re−1 (yi − H x
ˆi ).
sˆi|i = Lˆ
In the sequel we shall write equation (2) in the equivalent form
F¯ (P, D)P F T − P + GQGT = 0
where F¯ (P, D) = F − F P H T Re−1 (P, D)H and D = (F, H).

(3)

Assuming that the matrices F, G, H in (1) are subject to perturbations ΔF ,
ΔG, ΔH, we obtain the perturbed equation
F¯ (P, D + ΔD)P (F + ΔF )T − P + (G + ΔG)Q(G + ΔG)T = 0

(4)

where ΔD = (ΔF, ΔH),
F¯ (P, D + ΔD) = (F + ΔF ) − (F + ΔF )P (H + ΔH)T Re−1 (P, D + ΔD)(H + ΔH)
and

Re (P, D + ΔD) = Re (P, D) + ΔHP H T + HP ΔH T + ΔHP ΔH T .

Since the Fr´echet derivative of the left-hand side of (3) in P at P = P0 is
invertible, the perturbed equation (4) has a unique solution P = P0 + ΔP in the
neighborhood of P0 .
Denote by ΔM = ΔM F the absolute perturbation of a matrix M and let
T
Δ := [ΔF , ΔG , ΔH ] ∈ R3+ .
The sensitivity analysis of the Riccati equation (3) consists in ﬁnding estimate
for the absolute perturbation ΔP := ΔP F in the solution P as a function of
the absolute perturbations ΔF , ΔG , ΔH in the coeﬃcient matrices F , G, H.
A number of linear local bounds for ΔP have been derived in [6] - [12], based
on the condition numbers of (3). For instance, in [9] a perturbation bound of the
type
ΔP ≤ KF ΔF + KG ΔG + KH ΔH + O( Δ 2 ), Δ → 0
(5)
has been obtained, where KF , KG , KH are the condition numbers of (3) relative
to perturbations in the matrices F , G and H, respectively. However, it is possible
to obtain nonlinear local sensitivity estimates for (3) that are less conservative
than the condition numbers based sensitivity estimates.
The problem considered in this paper is to ﬁnd a ﬁrst order homogeneous
local perturbation bound
ΔP ≤ f (Δ) + O( Δ 2 ), Δ → 0,

(6)

which is tighter than the condition number based perturbation bounds.

Main Result

Denote by Φ(P, D) the left-hand side of the Riccati equation (3) and let P0 be
the positive deﬁnite or semi-deﬁnite solution of (3). Then Φ(P0 , D) = 0.
Setting P = P0 + ΔP , the perturbed equation (4) may be written as
Φ(P0 + ΔP, D + ΔD) =

(7)

Φ(P0 , D) + ΦP (ΔP ) + ΦF (ΔF ) + ΦG (ΔG) + ΦH (ΔH) + S(ΔP, ΔD) = 0
where ΦP (.), ΦF (.), ΦG (.), ΦH (.) are the Fr´echet derivatives of Φ(P, D) in the
corresponding matrix arguments, evaluated for P = P0 , and S(ΔP, ΔD) contains
the second and higher order terms in ΔP , ΔD.

The calculation of the Fr´echet derivatives of Φ(P, D) gives
ΦP (Z) = F¯0 Z F¯0T − Z

(8)

ΦF (Z) = F¯0 P0 Z + Z T P0 F¯0T
ΦG (Z) = GQZ + Z T QGT
ΦH (Z) = −F¯0 P0 ZR0−1 HP0 F T − F P0 H T R0−1 Z T P0 F¯0T
whereF¯0 = F¯ (P0 , D), R0 = Re (P0 , D).

Denoting MP ∈ Rn ×n , MF ∈ Rn ×n , MG ∈ Rn ×n , MH ∈ Rn ×n the
matrix representations of the operators ΦP (.), ΦF (.), ΦG (.), ΦH (.), we have
MP = F¯0 ⊗ F¯0 − In2
MF = In ⊗ F¯0 P0 + (F¯0 P0 ⊗ In )Π

(9)

MG = In ⊗ GQ + (GQ ⊗ In )Π
MH = −F P0 H T R0−1 ⊗ F¯0 P0 − (F¯0 P0 ⊗ F P0 H T R0−1 )Π
where Π ∈ Rn ×n is the permutation matrix such that vec(M T ) = Πvec(M )
for each M ∈ Rn×n .
The operator equation (7) may be written in a vector form as
2

vec(ΔP ) = N1 vec(ΔF ) + N2 vec(ΔG)

(10)

+ N3 vec(ΔH) − MP−1 vec(S(ΔP, ΔD))
where

N1 = −MP−1 MF , N2 = −MP−1 MG , N3 = −MP−1 MH .

It is easy to show that the condition number based perturbation bound (5) is
a corollary of (10). Indeed, it follows from (10)

and having in mind that

and denoting
K F = N1 2 , K G = N2 2 , K H = N3

2

we obtain
ΔP ≤ KF ΔF + KG ΔG + KH ΔH + O( Δ 2 ).

Relation (10) also gives
ΔP ≤ N

(12)

where N = [N1 , N2 , N3 ].
Note that the bounds in (11) and (12) are alternative, i.e. which one is less
depends on the particular value of Δ.
There is also a third bound, which is always less than or equal to the bound
in (11). We have
ΔP ≤

Δ U (N )Δ + O( Δ 2 )

(13)

where U (N ) is the 3 × 3 matrix with elements

Since Ni Nj

we get

Δ U (N )Δ ≤ N1 2 ΔF + N2 2 ΔG + N3 2 ΔH .
Hence we have the overall estimate
ΔP ≤ f (Δ, N ) + O( Δ 2 ), Δ → 0

(14)

where
f (Δ, N ) = min{ N

is a non-linear, ﬁrst order homogeneous and piece-wise real analytic function
in Δ.

Numerical Example

Consider a third order model of type (1) with matrices
F = V F ∗ V, G = V G∗ , H = H ∗ V
where V = I3 − 2vv T/3, v = [1, 1, 1]T and
F ∗ = diag(0, 0.1, 0), G∗ = diag(2, 1, 0.1)
H ∗ = diag(1, 0.5, 10).
The perturbations in the data are taken as
ΔF = V ΔF ∗ V, ΔG = V ΔG∗ , ΔH = ΔH ∗ V

Conclusion

In this paper the local sensitivity of the discrete-time inﬁnite-horizon H 2 estimation problem has been studied. A new, nonlinear local perturbation bound
has been obtained for the solution of the Riccati equation that determines the
sensitivity of the problem. The new local sensitivity estimate is a ﬁrst order homogeneous function of the data perturbations and is tighter than the condition
number based sensitivity estimates.
