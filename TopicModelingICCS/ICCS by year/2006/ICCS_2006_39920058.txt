Abstract. The present work contributes to the numerical simulation
of complex turbulent multiphasic ﬂuid ﬂows encountered in estuarine
channels. A numerical solution is based on Reynolds averaged NavierStokes equations using the mass preserving model based on the so-called
Raviart-Thomas ﬁnite element on the unstructured mesh in the horizontal plane. In the vertical, the computational domain is divided into
number of layers at predeﬁned heights and the method uses a conventional conforming ﬁnite element scheme, with the advantage that the
lowermost and uppermost layers variable height allow a faithful representation of the time-varying bed and free surface, respectively. A robust
up-to-date algorithm is used for computing the eddy viscosity from the
eﬃcient k − ε turbulence model for variable density ﬂuid ﬂows. Finally,
the capability and the predicting performance of the model are successfully evaluated by applying it to the simulation of the Po River Estuary
(PRE) in Italy.
Keywords: Finite Element model; multiphasic ﬂuid ﬂows; k − ε turbulence model; multi-layers system; unstructured grid; Estuary.

Introduction

Estuaries, where are situated many famous ports of the world, are the meeting
point between the freshwater charged with sediment from river and the saline sea
cold water. The present research ﬁnds its motivation in the increasing need for
eﬃcient management of estuaries by taking into account the various conﬂicting
environmental and socio-economical aspects.
Shallow water equations have been successfully applied to many engineering
problems and their use has become common practice in environmental impact
studies in estuarial and coastal regions.

Chen et al. [3] have successfully applied a three-dimensional ﬁnite diﬀerence
model with hydrostatic pressure distribution for simulating the Pearl River Estuary. Casulli and Chen [1] have developed a semi-implicit ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme
for the the 3D shallow water equations (SWE). Lie and Mellor [8], [9] have applied a 3D ﬁnite diﬀerence model for simulation the Hudson-Raritan Estuary
with a second order turbulence-closure sub-model. Lu and Wai [10] developed
an eﬃcient operator splitting scheme for 3D hybrid hydrodynamic model using
the so-called sigma transformation in the vertical direction. Chau and Jiang [2]
have developed a model based on POM (Princeton Ocean Model) with an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate in the horizontal direction and sigma coordinate
in the vertical direction for simulating the Pearl River Estuary.
Most of the existing models use a ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite volume approach
based on a topographically conform, sigma-transformed grid which, regardless
of the depth, forces the same number of divisions in the water column. However,
these models cannot ﬁt to complicated geometry and this may induce large large
errors if applied to complex boundary conﬁgurations.
In this study, the hydrodynamics solutions are obtained by solving the shallow water equations using implicit time marching scheme (see Leupi et al. [7], [6]),
while discretization is conducted using Euler or Runge-Kutta scheme to obtain
a set of algebraic equations. The model uses hydrostatic pressure distribution,
and an eﬃcient fractional time-step scheme of Mohammadi and Pironneau [12]
for the k − ε turbulence closure. This paper deals with the simulation of the 3D
turbulent ﬂow in the Po River Estuary in Italy.

Mathematical Models

A brief description of the model is provided in [7], [5]. Let us consider an incompressible ﬂuid body in a three-dimensional time varying domain Ω. Let Ω the
projection of Ω on the xy horizontal plane, bounded by the free-surface Γs given
by z = η(x, y, t), the bottom topography Γb given by z = −h(x, y), the open
boundary denoted by Γo . Where h(x, y) is the distance between the bottom and
the reference plane xy and η(x, y, t) the elevation of the free-surface with the
respect to the reference plane xy.
The RANS description of the turbulent motion relies on the Boussinesq approximation. For t > 0 and (x, y, z) ∈ Ω(t), and using the Boussinesq assumption
for the hydrostatic approximation we have that
1 ∂p
= −g ⇒ p = p0 + ρg (η − z)
ρ ∂z

(1)

where p0 is the atmospheric pressure.
For a variable density ﬂuid under the hydrostatic assumption the system of
the shallow water equations for long waves (vertical scale is negligible compared
to the horizontal one) reads

where α and β are the known coeﬃcients, ρ is the pore water density.
The equilibrium assumption is adopted at the bed (i.e local balance between
production of turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of dissipation) and the wall
functions are applied to relate the velocity to the bed shear velocity (see [7], [5]).
The physical 3D domain is embedded in a parallelepiped composed of N layers
and the reﬁne description can be found in [6]. The horizontal components of
the velocity vector are deﬁned at the middle of edges of the triangular mesh
elements, while the vertical component is associated with the lower horizontal
faces of the element. The horizontal velocity is approximated combining the
lowest order Raviart-Thomas element (RT0 ) in xy plane with the P1 elements
along the vertical direction.
The Lagrange-Galerkin (or characteristics Galerkin) approach is used to discretize the convection terms, while the Euler scheme or more accurate RungeKutta is used to obtain the algebraic system. The fractional time-step scheme
from Mohammadi and Pironneau ([7], [12]), is adopted to solve turbulence equations. Consequently, the positivity of k and ε is preserved as well as the stability
of the scheme (see [7]).

Application to the Po River Estuary in Italy

An eﬃcient decoupling scheme is employed to solve hydrodynamic, turbulence,
heat and salinity. The decoupling method partitions a time step into fractional
steps according to physical phenomena. In the ﬁrst step hydrodynamics is solved,
followed by turbulence closure, and ﬁnally the advection-diﬀusion equations for
passive scalars (temperature, salinity) are solved. PRE is located in the east
of the Adriatic Sea along the direction North West-North East (NW-NE). The
axis of PRE is east longitude 12.05◦ and north latitude 44◦ 96667. The M 2 main

tidal component is taken into account in this study and the mean wind speed
is 30 − 50[km/h]. The average discharge of the PRE is 1.5 × 103 [m3 /s]. For
simulating the tidal currents and sediment transport in PRE, a large area was
selected and the 2D horizontal plane mesh. The north upstream boundary has
been set far upstream the ﬁve open boundaries. The available ﬁeld data for the
model calibration were mostly provided by the MOX (Modeling and Scientiﬁc
Computing), Department of Mathematics, Politecnico of Milano and the Istituto
di ricerca Sulle Acque, CNR, Milan, Italy.

In this simulation, the horizontal unstructured mesh of simulated area has
been divided into 3185 triangles in each horizontal layer, and 2172 nodes with
the mean space step size ranging from dT = 6.2 to 46.08 [m] (where dT denotes
the diameter size of the circumscribed triangle). The vertical is divided into 30
layers. To account of the boundary layer eﬀects the bottom is divided into several
thin layers of thickness δzb = 0.5[m]. The simulation period is from 14.00 of 1st
of May to 14:00 of 2nd May 1999 for hydrodynamic calibration. The forcing is
neap tide in wet season. There are seven tide gauges and seven tide stations and

water open boundaries were controlled by tidal levels located at N V , N T , ST 1,
ST 2, SP 1, SP 2, SP 3.
Figure 1 shows the comparisons of the computed and observed tidal elevations
during the ﬂood at diﬀerent tide stations. As indicated, the model predicts the
tidal elevations with good accuracy. Figure 2 shows the comparisons of the computed and observed ﬂow velocity magnitude at the river upstream tide stations
and diﬀerent vertical layers position at respectively free-surface, 0.8H, 0.6H,
0.4H and 0.2H. Good agreement is found between computed and observed velocity distributions. The hydrodynamics computations have shown the ability of
the model. A wet spring current was chosen for one-year simulation period from
May 1999 to April 2000. The PRE is found to be a stable and fairly stratiﬁed
estuary (see [4]). This is in good accordance with the ﬁeld observation.

Conclusions

A Three-dimensional ﬁnite element solver has been successfully applied for simulating temporal behavior of stratiﬁed water bodies with environmental forcing,
by solving the SWE for incompressible ﬂow using the hydrostatic assumption
for pressure. Processes modeled include heat and salt distribution, tidal forcing,
surface wind forcing, inﬂows and outﬂows as well as the turbulence modeling
for multiphasic ﬂuid-solid ﬂow. The eﬀects of salinity and temperature are seen
during periods of simulation, and the micro-tidal PRE (i.e. tidal elevation < 2
[m]) is found to be a fairly stratiﬁed estuary. The model predicts realistically
the complex major features and their consequences on the 3D estuarine ﬂows.
The water elevation, velocity proﬁles computed from the numerical models were
compared successfully to the experiments. However, further application including the transport of sediment on the harbor channel is needed to improve the
general applicability of the model, and this will be next stage of this work.
