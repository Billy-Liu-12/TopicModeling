Abstract. Solving inequalities is a very important topic in computational algebra. This paper presents a new Maple package, IneqGraphics,
for displaying the two-dimensional solution sets of several inequalities of
real variables. The package also deals with inequalities involving complex variables by displaying the corresponding solutions on the complex
plane. The package provides graphical solutions to many inequalities
(such as those involving polynomial, rational, logarithmic, exponential
and trigonometric functions) that cannot be solved by using the standard
Maple commands, which are basically reduced to linear inequalities. In
addition, our outputs are consistent with Maple’s notation and results in
the sense that the package provides a similar output for those cases that
can also be solved with Maple. To show the performance of the package,
several illustrative and interesting examples are described.

Introduction

Solving inequalities is a very important topic in Mathematics, with outstanding
applications in many problems of theoretical and applied science [1, 2, 4, 6, 7].
However, since there is not a general methodolody for solving inequalities, their
symbolic computation is still a challenging problem in computational algebra [3].
For example, Maple includes some commands for dealing with inequalities, but
they are drastically limited to the linear case [5]. This drawback motivated us
to create a Maple package, IneqGraphics, that is introduced in this paper. The
package displays the two-dimensional solution sets of several inequalities. Typically, in our package the input might be comprised of any sequence of inequalities
(connected by either the and or or operators) involving nonlinear expressions such as polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions - that cannot be solved by using the standard Maple commands. The

package also deals with inequalities involving complex variables by displaying
the corresponding solutions on the complex plane.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the main standard
Maple tools for solving inequalities. Then, Section 3 introduces the new Maple
package, IneqGraphics, and describes the commands implemented within. The
performance of the package is also discussed in this section by using some illustrative examples. Finally, Section 4 closes with the main conclusions of this
paper and some further remarks.

Standard Maple Tools for Solving Inequalities

Maple incorporates only a few commands for solving inequalities. The command
solve(ineq,var), solves one inequality in one variable, var, for all the cases
where the equality points of ineq can be properly ordered. While it is not required for the inequality to be linear (for instance, you can solve ex > x + 1) it
only accepts one inequality, thus strongly limiting its applicability.
In addition, the Maple 10 package plots provides the command inequal
that plots regions deﬁned by logical combinations of linear inequalities in the
IR 2 space. Although its input allows us to enter more than one equality or
inequality, they must necessarily be linear. For example, the package fails to
display the solution sets of each of the inequalities x2 + y < 1 and x2 + y 2 ≤ 16
on the set [−5, 5] × [−5, 5]:
>with(plots):
Warning, the name changecoords has been redeﬁned
> inequal(x^ 2+y<1,x=-5..5,y=-5..5);
Error, (in inequal) the inequalities should be linear in ’x’ and ’y’
> inequal(x^ 2+y^ 2<16,x=-5..5,y=-5..5);
Error, (in inequal) the inequalities should be linear in ’x’ and ’y’
This problem has been partially overcome in [8] where the author presents
an interesting extension of the command inequal to the case of nonlinear expressions. In particular, his new command inequalities admits systems of
nonlinear inequalities, including the case of expressions given in polar coordinates. However, the package does not solve the problem in all its generality as
the inequalities can only be connected by the and operator, not all nonlinear
expressions can be considered and the polar form fails in presence of loops, multivalued curves and self-intersection scenarios, to mention some of the limitations
we noticed.
The package IneqGraphics, described in the next section, overcomes many of
those limitations and allows the user to solve a large family of real and complex
inequality systems and equations and display their two-dimensional solution sets
accordingly.

The Package IneqGraphics: Some Illustrative Examples

As shown in the previous section, inequalities involving nonlinear functions cannot be visualized by means of the inequal command. They can be solved, however, by loading the package developed by the authors:
> libname:="C:\\Program files\\Maple 10/mypackages", libname:
> with(IneqGraphics);
[complexineqplot, ineqplot]
which includes the command
ineqplot(ineqs, x=xmin..xmax, y=ymin..ymax, ops)
for displaying the two-dimensional region of the set of points satisfying the
inequalities ineqs of real numbers inside the square [xmin, xmax]×[ymin,
ymax]. For example, the inequalities indicated in the previous section can be
solved as follows:
> ineqplot(x^ 2+y<1,x=-5..5,y=-5..5);
See Figure 1(left)
> ineqplot(x^ 2+y^ 2<=16,x=-5..5,y=-5..5);
See Figure 1(right)

Fig. 1. Some examples of inequality solutions on the square [−5, 5] × [−5, 5]: (left)
x2 + y < 1; (right) x2 + y 2 ≤ 16

Similarly, Fig. 2 displays the solution sets of the inequalities 1 < x2 + y 2 < 4
1
and sin(x2 + y 2 ) ≥ on the squares [−2.5, 2.5]× [−2.5, 2.5] and [−4, 4]× [−4, 4],
2
respectively. Note that the Maple command inequal does not provide any solution for these inequalities either.

As mentioned above, our input can be comprised of several inequalities combined by using the and and or operators simultaneously. The next two examples
are aimed to show this fact:
> ineqplot(1<abs(x)+abs(y) and abs(x)+abs(y)<=2 or abs(x+y)<1/2,
x=-3..3,y=-3..3,linespoints=400,feasiblepoints=35);
See Figure 3(left)
> ineqplot((x+2)^ 2+y^ 2<=1 or (x-2)^ 2+y^ 2<=1 or ((x+2)^ 2+y^ 2>=3
and (x-2)^ 2+y^ 2>=3),x=-4..4,y=-2..2,feasiblepoints=30);
See Figure 3(right)
The previous command, ineqplot, can be generalized to inequalities involving
complex numbers. The new command:
complexineqplot(ineqs,z=(Rezmin..Rezmax,Imzmin..Imzmax),opts)
displays the solution sets of the inequalities ineqs of complex numbers inside the
square in the complex plane given by [Rezmin, Rezmax]× [Imzmin,Imzmax]. In
this case, the functions appearing within the inequalities need to be real-valued
functions of a complex argument, e.g. Abs, Re and Im. For example:
> complexineqplot({1<abs(z^ 2-z+1),abs(z^ 2-z+1)<4},
z=(-2...3.,-3...3.),feasiblepoints=25);

> complexineqplot({1<abs(sin(z-2)+z),abs(sin(z-2)+z)<4},
z=(-5...8.,-4...4.),feasiblepoints=35,linespoints=550);
See Figure 4(right)
We would like to point out that the output obtained from the package is consistent with Maple’s notation and results in the sense that the package provides
a similar output for those cases already solved by Maple. Figure 5 illustrates
this fact: on the left, the solutions provided by the standard Maple command

command ineqplot are shown. As the reader can see, the new solution sets
match perfectly those obtained from the standard Maple commands.
The last examples aim to show how complicated the inequality systems can be:
in addition to include polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions, combinations and even compositions of these (and other) functions can also be considered. In Figures 6 and 7 the solutions sets of the inequality

Conclusions and Further Remarks

introduced. The package extends Maple’s capabilities by providing graphical
solutions to many inequalities (such as those involving polynomial, rational,
trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions) that cannot be solved by
using the standard Maple commands and packages. The performance of the
package has been illustrated by means of several interesting examples. In all
the cases, the output obtained is consistent with Maple’s notation and results
in the sense that the package provides a similar output for those cases already
solved by Maple. We are currently working on the extension of these results to
the three-dimensional case and the implementation of new routines for other
kind of inequalities by using quantiﬁer elimination (QE) and cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) algorithms. The obtained results will be reported
elsewhere.
