Abstract. Quality (QOS) prediction is one of the most important research topics of workflow management system. In this paper, we propose
the SWQ approach to analytically evaluate QOS of workflow systems
based on QWF-net, which extends traditional WF-net by associating
tasks with exponential response time and exponential TTF (time-tofailure). The comparison between simulative and analytical results in
the case study indicates that the SWQ approach achieves satisfactory
accuracy. The paper concludes with a comparison between the SWQ
approach and other related work.

Introduction

With the advent and evolution of global scale economies, organizations need to be
more competitive, eﬃcient and ﬂexible. In the past decade, workﬂow techniques
have been widely used to address these needs.
However, among many research topics of workﬂow, performance/quality
analysis is yet to be given the importance it deserves. Techniques and models
[1-8] for QOS evaluation are still preliminary and limited. This paper introduces
an analytical approach, the SWQ (meaning a stochastic approach for quality
evaluation of workﬂow systems) to address the need for QOS evaluation. The
SWQ approach is based on QWF-net (stochastic WF-net) model, which is an
extension of traditional WF-net where tasks are associated with exponential
response time and exponential TTF (time-to-failure). By mapping the execution of QWF-net into a homogeneous continuous Markovian process, the SWQ
approach calculates its expected completion-time and reliability.
Through comparing simulative results and results obtained by SWQ approach,
the case-study indicates that our approach achieves satisfactory accuracy. The
paper concludes with a comparison between the SWQ approach and related
work.

QWF-Net for Quality Prediction

The Workﬂow net (WF-net) proposed by van der Aalst is a high level Petri Nets
with two special places i and o, which indicate the beginning and the end of the
modeled process. There exist four routing patterns in WF-nets, namely sequence,
parallel, selective and iterative. WF-net does not care the concept of time, but
sometimes we need to consider time aspect in workﬂow management systems.
For example, we want to know the completion time of the whole workﬂow net or
of some subnets so that we can decide whether the arrangement of the workﬂow
system meets constraint of time. So introducing time concept into WF-net is
necessary.
This section extends WF-net to QWF-net by associating an exponential response time and exponential TTF (Time-to-failure) with each task.
Definition 1. (QWF-net) N = (P, T, T ask, λ, μ) is a QWF-net if and only if:
1. N is structurally a WF-net
2. SPLIT/JOIN transitions (black thin bars in Fig.1) ﬁre immediately and have
response time of 0
3. SPLIT/JOIN transitions never fail
4. The set T ask ⊆ T denotes the set of transitions excluding SPLIT/JOIN
transitions (as illustrated by white bars in Fig.1)
5. Each task has an exponential response time. A function λ : T ask → Real
is used to identify parameter (also known as execution-rate) of the exponential response time of each task
6. Each task fails independently and has an exponential TTF. A function μ :
T ask → Real is used to identify parameter (also known as failure-rate) of
the exponential TTF of each task
It easily follows that QWF-net is identical with WF-net in construction aspect. Therefore, structural properties of WF-net also follow in QWF-net: there
should be no dead tasks; the procedure should terminate eventually; at the moment the procedure terminates there should be one token in sink place o and all
the other places are empty; the deﬁnition of reachable markings and its corresponding calculation methods for WF-net can also be applied to QWF-net.

Quality Evaluation Based on QWF-Net

Besides assumptions about exponential task response time and TTF, this paper
also assumes that:
1. The control ﬂow randomly chooses its path on XOR-split according to given
choice probabilities. For generality, this paper uses a function se : T ask →
Real to denote the probability that each task is selected when its preceding
task ﬁnishes execution. Note that, if a task is not on any XOR-split, its
choice probability equals 1, otherwise smaller than 1

2. The control ﬂow skips loop when current iteration ﬁnishes according to a
given probability. For generality, this paper uses a function lo : T ask → Real
to denote the probability that the control ﬂow skips each task when current
iteration ﬁnishes. Note that, if a task is not on any loop, its corresponding
skipping probability equals 1, otherwise smaller than 1. Therefore, for a task
1
, following a geometric
ti , its expected number of loop iterations is lo(t
i)
distribution.

Evaluating the Expected Completion Time (ECT)

This subsection presents an analytical method to calculate the expected completion time of QWF-net based on response time of each task. Let U (t) denote
the set of operational tasks in QWF-net at time t (execution begins at time 0),
then its state-space (denoted by S) is obtained through mapping each reachable
marking into a corresponding set of operational tasks.
For any reachable marking M1 ∈ [M0 > where no SPLIT/JOIN transitions
are activated, there exists a state which records all operational tasks in this
marking. Since SPLIT/JOIN transitions ﬁre immediately with response time 0,
there is no need to generate states indicating whether SPLIT/JOIN transitions
are activated or not. Take Fig.1 for example, the marking illustrated in this ﬁgure
where P1 contains a token is one such negligible marking since this marking
merely indicates that AN D − split1 transition is activated. Also note that the
marking where only sink place contains a token is mapped into an absorbing
state which records no task is operational, meaning all tasks are idle and the
control ﬂow terminates.
The state space of U (t) of Fig.1 are illustrated in Table.1. Note that, there
exist more than one initial-state since XOR−SP LIT1 may generate one token
into place P4 , P5 or P6 . S12 is the absorbing state.

As mentioned in the assumption, a task ti has exponential response time with
parameter λ(ti ) and the probability that control ﬂow skips task ti when current
iteration of ti ﬁnishes is lo(ti ) (lo(ti ) = 1 if ti is not on loop). The number of loop
iterations of ti , Nti , is a geometric distributed random variable with parameter
lo(ti ). Since task may be iteratively executed, this paper uses Dti to denote
the total response time of ti considering iterative execution and Xti to denote

According to the equation above, Dti follows exponential distribution with

task tl in Si ﬁnishes execution and becomes idle. Note that, there may exist
more than one resulting states of Si when tl becomes idle because transition
may activate choice (XOR-split). Those resulting states are viewed as diﬀerent types in the Markovian chain according to the phase-type property and
tm ∈N EW (i,j) se(tm ) denotes the occurrence probability of Sj among all types,
where NEW(i,j) denotes the set of newly-emerging operational tasks in the
transition from state Si to Sj .
Take the transition from state S8 to S12 for example, we have its transition
rate q8,12 as lo(t3 )λ(t3 ) according to Eq.3.

According to the equation above, the expected time for Si to reach termination is the expected duration of state Si ( E1S ) plus the averaged (by occurrence

probabilities) time-to-termination of its immediate succeeding states.
Therefore, the expected completion-time of QWF-net is the averaged(by occurrence probability) time-to-termination of all initial states. Let Init and
BU SYSi denote the set of initial states and the set of operational tasks in state
Si respectively, then the QWF-net’s expected completion time ECT is

Evaluating Reliability

The reliability estimate of ti is obtained through integrating the probability that
its TTF is larger than t (meaning the probability that ti does not fail till time
t) multiplied by PDF of Dti over the interval from 0 to ∞. Therefore, reliability

that TTF (time-to-failure) of ti is greater than t.

Case Study and Simulation

This section applies the SWQ approach to some examples and studies its accuracy through a comparison with Monte-Carlo simulation. The examples are
given by Fig.2. Tasks involved are listed in Table.2. Case1−4 are four simple
examples dealing with sequential, parallel, selective and iterative routing modes,
respectively. Case5 (given earlier in Fig.1) and Case6 are more complex examples featured by all routing modes.
A simulation procedure is developed to evaluate expected completion time
and reliability of QWF-net. The simulation procedure is similar to simulation

algorithms for SPN (stochastic Petri-net) performance analysis, which use random variable generators to decide ﬁring delay of each transition at each simulation run. The procedure is executed for suﬃciently many times. At each run,
the procedure randomly chooses a path along XOR-split and decides the numbers of loop iterations of loops according to predeﬁned probabilities. Then the
procedure uses exponential-distribution random variable generators to generate
response time of each task. Also, the program uses random variable generators
to generate the TTF of every task. At each run, if all tasks’ TTF are greater
than their response time (meaning no failure happens during the execution of
this task), a success is recorded. The simulative estimates of completion-time is
obtained through averaging completion-time of all runs. The simulative estimate
of reliability is the ratio of successes to the number of all runs.
Results obtained by simulation (illustrated in normal style) are compared with
those by the SWQ approach (illustrated in bold style ) in Table.3. As shown,
analytical results is pretty close to simulative results. It indicates that SWQ
approach achieves satisfactory accuracy.

Comparison with Related Work

Research of [2,3] uses a reduction technique to simplify sequential, parallel, selective and iterative routing patterns into a single transition with equivalent QOS
estimate, however these methods are not very realistic since they assume tasks
in WF-net have deterministic response time rather than nondeterministic as this
paper does.
Methods of [1,7,8] are similar to the SWQ approach in that they also model
the control ﬂow as continuous Markov chains. These models map execution of
each task into each state of CTMC chain and analytically evaluate transition
probability or transition rate between states. However these methods can not
model parallel execution of more than one tasks in their Markov chains.
Method proposed by [5] develops a simpliﬁcation technique to simplify four
basic routing patterns into a single task with approximate equivalent performance and assumes that the equivalent task still follows exponential distribution if all tasks have exponential response time. However, its assumption that
the simpliﬁed construct still follows exponential distribution is obviously inaccurate and unrealistic. For instance, n tasks with exponential response time of the
same execution rate arranged by sequential routing pattern should be simpliﬁed
into a single equivalent task of n-phase Erlang response time (which is obviously
not exponential).

Conclusion

This paper proposes the SWQ method to analytically evaluate QOS (expectedcompletion-time and reliability) of workﬂow systems based on the QWF-net
model, which extends traditional WF-net by associating tasks with exponential response time and TTF. This paper also develops a simulation procedure
to calculate the simulative QOS results. The comparison between simulative
and analytical results in the case study indicates that SWQ approach achieves
satisfactory accuracy.
