Introduction

Besides their extremely important biological function, molecules of DNA are
useful in many areas, as biotechnology, nanotechnology and electronics. Possibility of design of molecules of exactly known composition and length opened an
area for using DNA for construction of diﬀerent structures. Appropriate choice
of DNA sequences allows to obtain not only linear chains but also branched
DNA molecules. These synthetical branches are analogs of branched DNA molecules (Holliday junctions) discovered in living cells. Addition of sticky ends to
such junctions enables a construction of complex molecular systems. Holliday
junctions occurring naturally are present between two symmetrical segments of
DNA strands, and because of that, the branch point is free to migrate. Such a
behaviour is not advantageous when DNA strands are used for a construction of
networks. Elimination of symmetry in synthetically made DNA molecules ﬁxes
the branch points location. Synthetical junctions give an opportunity for building complex structures from branches prepared specially for given purposes; this
enables to construct junctions with diﬀerent numbers of arms. Addition of sticky
ends to three- or four-armed branches allows to construct two-dimensional lattices, and using six-armed branches – for a construction of 3D lattices [1, 2].
Diﬀerent kinds of branched molecules can be connected with linear strands or
to each other. Appropriate choice of DNA and other allows for a construction of
lattices of speciﬁc parameters.

One of the most important problems occurring during the network formation is that the angles between the arms of branched junctions are variable.
This problem can be solved by using branches with four diﬀerent sticky ends.
Besides a stabilization of the edges, this solution eliminates improper connections between arms. Second important problem with DNA network formation
is that the polymer strands are ﬂexible. They can cyclize on itself what prevents further growth of the system [2]. To construct periodic lattices, such as
e.g. crystals, which can be used in nanoelectronics, polymers must be rigid.
Construction of crystals is possible since DNA double-crossover motifs were developed [2]. As the DNA double helix width is about 2 nm and one helical
repeat length is about 3.4 nm, lattices made from DNA strands can be useful in the emerging nanotechnology. It is possible to use DNA to form crystals
with edge length of more than 10 μm and a uniform thickness of about 1-2 nm
[4]. One of main advantages of DNA structures is a possibility of their modiﬁcations by binding diﬀerent ions and groups of ions or ﬂuorescent labels [3, 2].
This is useful in electronic devices where nanometer-scale precision is extremely
important.
Here we are interested in a design of random networks of DNA molecules.
This aim is motivated as follows: the above mentioned limitations and conditions of the production of DNA lattices and crystals can be found to be too
severe and in consequence too costful for some applications, where periodic
structures are not necessary. In this case, properties of networks of DNA can
be relevant for these potential applications of various two-dimensional structures, e.g. of polymers and liquid crystals [6, 7]. On the other hand, process
of formation of a random network is close to some model processes of current
interest for theories of disordered matter [8]. Then, interpretation of our numerical results allows to comment to what extent assumptions of these theories
are minimal. As it is discussed below, our results suggest that some conclusions
of the percolation theory in uncorrelated Bethe lattice can apply to correlated
structures.
We are going to investigate the size distribution of empty holes (pores) in a
random network. This aim should allow to evaluate the network in a role of a kind
of molecular sieve [9]. Whilst disorder in such a sieve is obviously a disadvantage
when compared to periodic structures [2], it seems to us worthwhile to evaluate
consequences of this disorder.
In subsequent section the model is described and some details are given on its
numerical realization. In Section III we show the results on the size distribution
of the pores, obtained for a triangular two-dimensional lattice. Short discussion
closes the text.

Model

In our model we initially consider two kinds of molecules: linear DNA strands
and DNA-junctions, which connect ends of the strands. The latter can be of
three or four arms; they are called Y- and X-junctions. We assume that the

length of the linear molecules is much larger, than the size of the junctions.
Also, we assume that the number of junctions is so much larger than the number
of strands, that i) practically any collision of two ends of the strands leads
to their ﬁxed connection, ii) the junctions do not inﬂuence the motion of the
strands in other way, than as in i). Summarizing, our assumptions on the DNAjunctions (enough small and enough numerous) allow to neglect them during the
simulation.
To speed up numerical calculations, the algorithm is based on a periodic
lattice. It is straightforward to apply the square lattice in the case of X-junctions,
and the triangular lattice in the case of Y-junctions. The length of the linear
DNA strand is chosen to be an integer multiple of the size of the lattice cell.
An additional assumption is that, no more than arbitrary chosen number M of
diﬀerent DNA strands are placed at the same lattice node, at the same time.
This limits the density of the system from above, to reproduce the steric eﬀect.
We have only three model parameters: the length L of the strands, their number
N , and the maximal number M of strands at one lattice cell. A strand cannot
rotate, but only moves along its axis. The direction of the latter is random, with
equal probabilities 1/2 at each time step. Initial set of the strand positions is
selected to be entirely random (positions and orientations), with only the above
mentioned limitation of the density. We choose periodic boundary conditions,
to limit an inﬂuence of the borders. Subsequent positions are controlled by the
assumption that in the one cell can not be more molecules that arbitrary chosen
number M. Possible orientations of the strands are horizontal or vertical in the
case of square lattice. In the case of triangular lattice, three orientations of the
strands are equally possible, along all three sides of the triangle. If the number
of ends of the strands at a given cell of the lattice is equal to or more than two
(but not more than M , which is forbidden by the code), these strands become
connected to a DNA-junction and to each other and they cannot move anymore.
If at any time step two diﬀerent strands are placed at the same cells only one of
them, chosen randomly, can be connected to the DNA-junction. In one simulation
step all molecules which are not immobile can move with equal probability to
the right or left if they are oriented horizontally, and up or down if they are
vertical in the case of square lattice. In the case of triangular lattice the strands
can move in two possible directions, in accordance with their orientation. At
each time step each strand can move by the length equal to the size of the one
lattice cell. A movement is accepted if, as its consequence, the number of strands
at all lattice cells is not more then M .
All results are obtained as average value from ten independent simulations,
and the lattice size was 512×512. Each simulation was made for 100 time steps.
Duration of the simulation was chosen so as to a number of free strands was in
range of few percent (2-3). In all simulations we studied distribution of the pores,
i.e. the lattice nodes which are not occupied by the DNA strands as a function of
the model parameters. The size distribution of the pores was investigated using
the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm [10].

Results

The results presented in Figs. 1-4 are obtained for the case of triangular lattice
with M = 3. The number N of molecules introduced to the system varies from
104 (Fig. 1) to 4 × 104 (Fig. 4). The plot shown in Fig. 1 shows that there are
large pores in the system, but their number is exactly one for each size s; in other
words, the system is diluted. For larger N we see that the pore size distribution is
close to a power law, i.e. Ng (s) ∝ s−τ , with τ ≈ 1.6 for N = 2 × 104 and τ ≈ 2.0
for N = 3 × 104 . This is seen in Figs. 2 and 3. A further increase of the number

N of molecules leads to a cutoﬀ of the scale-free character of the plot (Fig. 4).
The size of maximal pores is then reduced from 100 or more to about 30.
Similar results are obtained for other strand lengths L. As a rule, for low
values of N the shape of the function Ng (s) is close to the one in Fig. 1. For
larger N we see a power-law function, as in Figs. 2 and 3. When N increases
further, large pores vanishes. This common behaviour is summarized in Fig. 5,
where a kind of phase diagram is presented. Assuming that the scale-free powerlaw function is proper at only one value of Lc (N ), where the concentration of the
strands is at the percolation threshold, we marked approximate position of this

from our data is that Lc decreases with N .

Discussion

As it was noted in the Introduction, our results appear to be close to what could
be expected for an uncorrelated percolation in Bethe lattice [8]. For M = 3,
the percolation threshold is pc = 1/(M − 1) = 0.5. By symmetry, we can interchange occupied cells and empty cells. Then, the pore distribution for p > pc is
equivalent to the cluster size distribution below the percolation threshold, i.e. for
p < pc , where the giant component is absent. At the percolation threshold, we expect that the average number of strands at the network nodes is pc M = 1.5. Actually, we obtain the average number of strands equal to 1.39, 1.48, 1.52 and 1.53
for L = 7 and N = 1, 2, 3 and 4 × 104 , respectively. This means that, keeping the
analogy with the uncorrelated percolation in the Bethe lattice, we are close to the
percolation threshold. Theoretical value of the exponent τ in the two-dimensional
Bethe lattice is 187/91 ≈ 2.05[8]. Taking into account our numerical errors, this is
not in contradiction with our evaluations. Moreover, the cluster size distribution
above the percolation threshold in the Bethe lattice theory fulﬁls the equation
Ng (s, L)/Ng (s, Lc ) ∝ exp(−cs). This formula is checked in Fig. 6 with data from
Figs. 3 and 4. Again, the obtained data are not in contradiction with theory.
However, our network is neither uncorrelated, nor the Bethe lattice. Correlations appear because the strands are allowed to move until ﬁnally attached
to some other strands. From this point of view, the system is analogous to the
diﬀusion-limited aggregation (DLA), where the density of the growing cluster
decreases in time. The diﬀerence is that in DLA, the cluster grows from some
nucleus, which is absent in our simulation. On the other hand, loops are not
prevented here, unlike in the Bethe lattice. The similarity of our results to the
latter model allows to suspect that in random structure near the percolation
threshold the contribution to the cluster size distribution from accidental loops
remains small.
The same calculations are performed also for the two-dimensional square lattice. Here the power-law like character of the pore size distribution is less convincing. It seems likely that this additional diﬃculty is due to the fact that the
triangular lattice is closer to the oﬀ-lattice model than the square lattice. In general, the lattice introduces numerical artifacts, which can be expected to disturb
the system for small values of L. In the limit of large L, it is only the anisotropy
of the lattice which is diﬀerent from the ideal oﬀ-lattice limit. This numerically
induced anisotropy allows for three orientations for the triangular lattice and
two orientations for the square lattice. In an oﬀ-lattice calculation, the number
of orientations would be inﬁnite.
