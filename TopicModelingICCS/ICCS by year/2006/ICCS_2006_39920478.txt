Abstract. This paper considers the open problem whether there
exists a ﬁnite-state hybrid output feedback control to asymptotically stabilize a second-order linear dynamic system. More precisely, for secondorder linear time-invariant systems which are not stabilizable via a single
static output feedback, we ﬁnd two diﬀerent output feedback gains and a
switching law orchestrating the feedback gains such that the closed-loop
system is asymptotically stable.

Introduction

Given a linear time-invariant dynamic system
x(t)
˙
= Ax(t) + Bx(t)
y(t) = Cx(t)

(1)

where x ∈ Rn , u ∈ Rm , y ∈ Rp , and A, B, C are matrices of suitable dimensions,
if system (1) is stabilizable and detectable, then there exists a linear dynamic
output feedback law that asymptotically stabilizes the system [1]. In practice,
however, such continuous dynamic feedback might not be implemental, and a
hybrid version of the controller is often desired. We present a motivation example,
which was also discussed in [2], [3] and [4].
Example 1. Consider the harmonic oscillator model, which can be written in the
form of (1) with
A=

0 1
−1 0

,

B=

0
1

,

C= 10 .

(2)

Although this system is both controllable and observable, it cannot be stabilized
by a single static output feedback [2]; however, it is stabilizable by a hybrid
output feedback [3], [4]. Letting u = −y and u = y2 we obtain the following
systems, respectively,
0 1
x(t),

x(t)

and

Deﬁne V (x) = x21 + x22 . If system (3) is active in the ﬁrst and third quadrants,
while system (4) is active in the second and fourth quadrants, we will have
V˙ < 0 whenever x1 x2 = 0, which implies that the entire switched system is
asymptotically stable by LaSalle’s Principle (e.g., [15]).
Therefore, the hybrid output feedback stabilization problem can be formulated
as follows [5]: ﬁnd a ﬁnite collection of m × p gain matrices {K1 , · · · , Kl }, and
a switching law σ : [0, ∞) → {1, · · · l}, such that the switched linear system
x(t)
˙
= Aσ(t) x(t) is asymptotically stable, where Aσ(t) = A + BKσ(t) C, and the
output feedback control is given by u(t) = Kσ(t) y(t). To rule out trivial cases,
we assume the system (1) cannot be static output feedback stabilized.
Stability analysis for switched systems has achieved many results, which
mostly based on the common Lyapunov function or the multiple Lyapunov function approach [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Stabilization problem is the control design
for stability, while available techniques that can be used in the hybrid output
feedback control have been very few. The diﬃculty led researchers to study it
ﬁrst in the low-order systems. In [12], it has been shown that if system (1) is
controllable and observable, then it admits a stabilizing hybrid output feedback
that uses a countable number of discrete states. More recently, [5] constructs
a 2-state output feedback for a class of second-order linear systems incorporated with a conic switching law [13], [14], which provide a description of the
switching law based on the angles of subsystem vector ﬁelds and the geometric
properties of the phase plane. However, their approach may be complicated to
work with or determine the exact parametric value for which the switching law
yields instability of the feedback system.
In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing a 2-state hybrid output feedback control to stabilize a second-order linear dynamic system. This
approach is composed of two important parts. First, we consider the asymptotic stabilization problem of second-order autonomous switched linear systems
consisting of two subsystems with unstable focus equilibrium. Using the ”most
stabilizing” switching law, we translate the switched system into a piecewise linear system that yields an easily veriﬁable suﬃcient condition for stabilization of
this system. Secondly, 2-state output feedback gains are constructed in terms of
control system matrices (A, B, C), which extends the results in [5].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the asymptotic
stabilization for an autonomous switched linear system. Section 3 designs the 2state hybrid output feedback control. Numerical examples are given in section
4. Section 5 summarizes.

Stabilization for Switched Linear Systems

Consider an autonomous switched linear system given by
x(t)
˙
= Aσ(t) x(t)
σ : [0, ∞) → {1, 2}

(5)

where x ∈ R2 and σ(t) is the switching law indicating the active subsystem at
each instant. Let λi,± = αi ± βi be the eigenvalues of Ai , respectively.
Lemma 1. [16]. For the two subsystems of the switched linear system (5), there
exists a nonsingular matrix Q, such that
QA1 Q−1 =

α1 β1 /E
−Eβ1 α1

,

QA2 Q−1 =

α2 β2
−β2 α2

.

(6)

Without loss of generally, we only discuss the results for |E| < 1. In the case
of 0 < E < 1, the system trajectory diverges to ∞ clockwisely, while in the case
−1 < E < 0, then counter-clockwisely. Therefore, in the following discussion, we
assume the subsystems’ state matrices have the form (6).
We ﬁrst observe that the locus of both subsystems circle around the origin
and diverge to clockwisely or counter-clockwisely. We will show that the ”most
stabilizing” switching law corresponds to switching between the two subsystem’s vector ﬁelds are parallel. Here, by ”most stabilizing” case, we mean if the
switched system is stabilizable, then the system’s trajectory converges to the
origin under this switching law, that is, select an active subsystem which would
drive the trajectory closer to the origin.
Deﬁne l− and l+ as the lines on which the subsystem’s vector ﬁeld A1 xand
A2 x are parallel. Then on l± we have
−β2 x1 + α2 x2
−Eβ1 x1 + α1 x2
=
.
α2 x1 + β2 x2
α1 x1 + (1/E)β1 x2

(7)

Solving this equation we obtain that if
D ≥ 0,
then
x2 = ν± x1 ,
where, when

R2 = {(x1 , x2 )|x2 ≥ ν− x1 and x2 ≥ ν+ x1 },
where −Ri is the opposite region of Ri against the origin on the phase plane,
i = 1, 2, see Fig.1.
In the case 0 < E < 1, the trajectories of subsystems 1, 2 are all clockwise
logarithmic spirals. Then the ”most stabilizing” switching law would be:
Switch to subsystem 1 whenever the system trajectory enters the regions R1
and −R1 , and switch to subsystem 2 whenever the system trajectory enters the
regions R2 and −R2 .

Now, if the piecewise linear system (11) is asymptotically stable, then the
switched linear system (5) asymptotically stabilizable.
Theorem 1. [16]. The autonomous switched linear system (5) consisting of two
subsystems with unstable focus equilibrium is asymptotically stabilizable if D > 0,
0 < E < 1 and ρ < 1, where

Remark 1. For D > 0, 0 < E < 1, the trajectories of subsystems 1, 2 are counterclockwise, clockwise logarithmic spirals, respectively. In the case we could also
deﬁne the ”most stabilizing” switching law and get the similar conclusion as
Theorem 1. When D > 0, then at least on the half phase plane, one subsystem’s
vector ﬁeld always points on the same side of other. Form the proof of Theorem
1 we know in this case system (5) cannot be asymptotically stabilizable.

Hybrid Output Feedback Control

In this section, we construct 2-state hybrid output feedback gains in terms of
control system matrices (A, B, C), which deduced closed-loop system matrices
satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1. For simply, we only focus discussion on
second-order single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, i.e., m = 2, n = p = 1
in system (1). Since a nonsingular linear transformation does not change the
stabilization property, we consider system (1) in the following form:
A=

a11 a12
a21 a22

,

B=

0
1

,

C= 1c ,

(13)

where aij , c ∈ R, i, j = 1, 2.
Theorem 2. For the second-order linear time-invariant system (13), if c = 0,
and a12 = 0, then it is stabilizable via a static or 2-state hybrid output feedback.
Proof. For system (13), the closed-loop system with output feedback u = ki y is
given by x˙ = Ai x, i = 1, 2, where
Ai = A + ki BC =

a11 a12
a21 + ki a22

.

(14)

Since a12 = 0 , if a11 + a22 < 0, obviously there exists output feedback gain
ki such that Ai is Hurwitz stable, that is, system (13) could be static output
feedback stabilizable. As for the case a11 + a22 ≥ 0 , let Δi is the discriminant of
the characteristic equation for the coeﬃcient matrices Ai , i = 1, 2, If we chooseki
such that
Δi = 4(α2 − |A| + a12 ki ) < 0
(15)
then Ai ’s eigenvalues are express as λi± = α + jβi , where
α=
βi =

a11 + a22
,
2

|A| − α2 − a12 ki .

From Lemma 1, we know there exists a coordinate transformation y = Qx,
Q = (qij )2×2 , changes the closed-loop system into y˙ = Ai y, where Ai = QAi Q−1 ,
i = 1, 2, and
α β1 /E

Solving the equation QAi = Ai Q, i = 1, 2, we obtain that E =

q12 = 0,

(a11 − a22 )q22 = 2a12 q21 ,
β2 q22 = a12 Q11 .
If we further assume that
β1 < β2 ,

(17)

then according the discussion in Section 2, we have
0 < E < 1,

Under the coordinate transformation y = Qx, we obtain that at the parallel
lines

ν± =

q11 x1 + q12 x2

In view of the discussion thus far, we should choose the constants ki satisﬁes
(15), (18), and such that βi satisﬁes ρ < 1. It is not diﬃcult to show that such
ki always exist. Therefore, we conclude that in this case system (13) always
stabilizable via the 2-state hybrid output feedback control

(19)

The proof is complete.
Remark 2. For c = 0, and a12 = 0, we could also design the output feedback
gains such that closed-loop switched system satisﬁes the condition of Theorem
1. Of course they might be nonexistence. When a12 = 0, system (13) is uncontrollable, then unstabilizable.

We can easily verify that the pair (k1 , k2 ) = (−1, −38) satisﬁes the required
conditions (15), (18), and ρ = 0.8697 < 1. Then the 2-state hybrid output

Conclusion

This paper studies the hybrid output feedback stabilization of second-order linear
dynamic systems. For a class of such systems, we showed that the system is
stabilizable via a 2-state static output feedback incorporated with an appropriate
switching law. Output feedback gains and switching law are constructed in terms
of control system matrices. Extension of the proposed results to general highdimensional linear systems is considered to be an interesting future work.
