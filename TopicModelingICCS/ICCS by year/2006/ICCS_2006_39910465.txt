Abstract. The dynamic properties of POD modes of the fluctuating velocity
field developing in the wall region of turbulent channel flow are investigated.
The flow of viscous incompressible fluid in a channel is simulated numerically
by means of a parallel computational code based on a mixed spectral-finite
difference algorithm for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes
equations. The DNS approach (Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulence) is
followed in the calculations, performed at friction Reynolds number Reτ = 180 .
A database representing the turbulent statistically steady state of the flow
through 10 viscous time units is assembled and the Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition technique (POD) is applied to the fluctuating portion of the
velocity field. The dynamic properties of the most energetic POD modes are
investigated showing a clear interaction between streamwise-independent
modes and quasi-streamwise modes in the temporal development of the
turbulent flow field.

1 Introduction
The hypothesis incorporated in all turbulence theories that have been formulated in
the last decades is that of the local isotropy of the small turbulent scales (Kolmogorov
[1]), i.e. the postulate that the small-scale structures of turbulent flows possess
universal statistical properties independent of the large scales. Local isotropy has also
been enforced in most of the existing SGS (subgrid-scale) closures within the LES
(Large Eddy Simulation) approach to turbulence modelling.
The verification of the hypotheses that provide the basis for turbulence theories is
an issue of remarkable relevance for both theoreticians and modellers. Several
reseachers provided evidence of the “-5/3” velocity spectrum in the inertial range,
while the issue of the universal statistical properties of small turbulent scales in both
inertial and dissipation ranges is still controversial. One of the difficulties encountered
is that of reaching values of the Reynolds number able to assure the development of a
sufficiently broad spectrum of scales for the possible establishment of local isotropy
of the small scales.
The properties of the velocity field has been studied numerically in homogeneous
shear flow with constant mean shear by Pumir & Shraiman [2]. They showed that for

values of the Taylor microscale Reynolds number of order 100 the value of the
derivative skewness of the velocity fluctuation in the direction of the mean flow along
the direction of the mean velocity gradient, is of order 1. Garg & Warhaft [3] studied
experimentally the properties of the small-scale velocity field in homogeneous shear
flow with constant mean shear. They found that there is a significant skewness (of
order 1) of the derivative of the longitudinal velocity fluctuation in the direction of the
mean gradient. Third-order transverse structure functions of the longitudinal velocity
were found to have a scaling range, showing the existence of anisotropy at both inertial
and dissipation scales. Shen & Warhaft [4] continued the experiments. They showed
that the fifth moment of the derivative of the longitudinal fluctuation in the direction of
the mean gradient, is of order 10 with no diminution with the Reynolds number.
Moreover, fifth- and seventh-order inertial subrange skewness structure functions are
of order 10 and 100 respectively. These results show that there exists velocity
anisotropy in both inertial and dissipation ranges, for the Reynolds number tested.
A more recent approach to turbulence modelling, that differs from the most used
RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) and LES (Large Eddy
Simulation), involves methods for the reduction of the turbulent phenomenon to a
system with a limited number of degrees of freedom. The Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) is a technique that permits the extraction of appropriatelydefined modes of the flow from the background flow, that can be subsequently
projected onto the system of the Navier-Stokes equations to obtain a low-order model
of a given turbulent flow (Podvin & Lumley [5], Omurtag & Sirovich [6]). A relevant
issue in this context is the investigation of the dynamic properties of the flow modes
as extracted with the POD technique.
The present work addresses the issue of the dynamic characteristics of the coherent
structures of turbulence in moderately turbulent channel flow, educed by applying the
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to the fluctuating portion of the velocity field. The
POD modes are calculated from a numerical database assembled with the use of a
parallel computational code for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes
equations in the case of the plane channel at friction Reynolds number Reτ = 180 .

2 Methods
The simulations have been performed with a parallel computational code based on a
mixed spectral-finite difference technique. The unsteady Navier-Stokes equations for
incompressible fluids with constant properties in three dimensions and nondimensional conservative form, is considered (i & j = 1,2,3):

where ui (u , v , w ) are the velocity components in the cartesian coordinate system

lenghts, wall shear velocity uτ = τ w ρ for velocities, ρuτ2 for pressure and δ uτ for

time, being Reτ = (uτ δ ν ) the friction Reynolds number.
The fields are admitted to be periodic in the streamwise (x) and spanwise (z)
directions, and equations (1) are Fourier transformed accordingly. The nonlinear
terms in the momentum equation are evaluated pseudospectrally by antitransforming the velocities back in physical space to perform the products (FFTs
are used). A dealiasing procedure is applied to avoid errors in transforming the
results back to Fourier space. In order to have a better spatial resolution near the
walls, a grid-stretching law of hyperbolic-tangent type has been introduced for the
grid points along y, the direction orthogonal to the walls. For the time advancement,
a third-order Runge-Kutta algorithm has been implemented and the time marching
procedure is accomplished with the fractional-step method. No-slip boundary
conditions at the walls and cyclic conditions in the streamwise and spanwise
directions have been applied to the velocity. More detailed descriptions of the
numerical scheme, of its reliability and of the performance obtained on the parallel
computers that have been used, can be found in Alfonsi et al. [7] and Passoni et al.
[8],[9],[10].
By recalling the wall formalism, one has:
xi+ = xi uτ ν = xi δ τ ,
t + = tuτ2 ν = tuτ δ τ , δ + = δ δ τ , u + = u uτ , Reτ = uτ δ ν = δ δ τ = δ + , where u is
streamwise velocity averaged on a x-z plane and time, δ τ = ν uτ is the viscous length

and δ uτ the viscous time unit. The characteristic parameters of the numerical
simulations are the following. Computing domain: Lx = 2πδ , L y = 2δ , Lz = πδ ;
L+x = 1131 , L+y = 360 , L+z = 565 . Computational grid: N x = 96 , N y = 129 , N z = 64 .

= 0.87 , Δz + = 8.8 . It can be verified
Grid spacing: Δx + = 11.8 , Δy center

that there are 6 grid points in the y direction within the viscous sublayer ( y + ≤ 5 ).
The Kolmogorov spatial microscale, estimated using the criterion of the average
dissipation rate per unit mass across the width of the channel, results η + ≈ 1.8 . After
the insertion of appropriate initial conditions, the initial transient of the flow in the
channel has been simulated, the turbulent statistically steady state has been reached
and then calculated for a time t = 10 δ uτ ( t + = 1800 ). 20000 time steps have been
calculated with a temporal resolution of Δt = 5 × 10 −4 δ uτ ( Δt + = 0.09 ).
In Table 1 predicted and computed values of a number of mean-flow variables are
reported ( U b and U c are the bulk mean velocity and the mean centerline velocity
respectively, while Reb and Rec are the related Reynolds numbers). The predicted
values of U c U b and C f are obtained from the correlations suggested by Dean [11]
[ U c U b = 1.28(2 Reb )

] while the computed skin friction

coefficient [ C f = (2τ w ρU ) ; τ w = μ (∂U ∂y )wall ] is calculated using the value of the
shear stress at the wall actually obtained in the computations (a finite difference
routine is used).

The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is a technique that can be applied for the
extraction of the coherent structures from a turbulent flow field (Berkooz et al. [12],
Sirovich [13]). By considering an ensemble of temporal realizations of a velocity field
ui x j , t on a finite domain D, one wants to find which is the most similar function to
the elements of the ensemble, on average. This problem corresponds to find a
deterministic vector function ϕ i (x j ) such that (i & j=1,2,3):

( )

(ψ i (x j ),ψ i (x j ))

=

(ui (x j , t ), ϕi (x j )) 2
(ϕ i (x j ), ϕ i (x j ))

.

(2)

A necessary condition for problem (2) is that ϕ i (x j ) is an eigenfunction, solution
of the eigenvalue problem and Fredholm integral equation of the first kind:

∫

Rij (xl , xl′ )ϕ j (xl′ )dxl′ =

∫

D

ui (xk , t )u j (xk′ , t ) ϕ j (xk′ )dxk′ = λϕ i (xk )

(3)

where Rij = ui (xk , t )u j (xk′ , t ) is the two-point velocity correlation tensor. To each

eigenfunction ϕ i (x j ) is associated a real positive eingenvalue λ(n ) and every
member of the ensemble can be reconstructed by means of the modal decomposition
(n )
ui (x j , t ) = ∑n an (t )ϕ i (x j ) . The contribution of each mode to the kinetic energy
(n )

content of the flow is given by E = ∫ ui (x j , t )ui (x j , t ) dx j = ∑nλ(n ) , being E the
D

turbulent kinetic energy in the domain D. In the present work the POD is used for the
analysis of the fluctuating portion of the velocity field. The two homogeneous
directions are handled in Fourier space so that the optimal representation of the
velocity field in the statistical sense outlined above is sought in the direction normal
to the solid walls.

energies of the velocity fluctuations of the first 10 most energetic modes of the
decomposition (m and n are the wavenumbers along x and z, respectively and q is the

About 6.9% of the energy resides in the first three streamwise-independent modes
(m=0). The first mode that exhibits a streamwise dependence is the fourth.
Figure 1 shows two surfaces of constant streamwise velocity (the light surface is
positive, the dark surface is negative streamwise velocity) reconstructed from the first
most energetic eigenfunction. The visualization shows two structures elongated in the
streamwise direction. Flow representations (not reported) of the second and third
eigenfunctions have shown streamwise-independent structures similar to those of
Figure 1, with appropriate repetitions according to the values of m and n. Figure 2
shows surfaces of constant streamwise velocity reconstructed from the fourth most
energetic eigenfunction of the decomposition. This is the first streamwise-dependent
eigenfunction. The visualization shows couples of bean-shaped quasi-streamwise flow
structures, where one of the structure of each couple is lower with respect to the first
(more displaced toward the center of the channel). Flow representations (not reported)
of the fifth eigenfunction have shown bean-shaped structures aligned in the
streamwise direction, similar to those of Figure 2.
Figure 3 shows the flow structure – identified in terms of surfaces of constant
streamwise velocity – formed by the sum of the first five most energetic POD modes
(three x-independent structures of the type shown in Figure 1 and two x-dependent
turbulent structures of the type shown in Figure 2) at t + = 72 . Two dominant
structures elongated in the streamwise direction are visible. With particular reference

to the positive (light) surface it clearly appears that the shape of the basic streamwiseelongated structure is altered because of the interaction with the travelling beanshaped quasi-streamwise modes. This is the basic mechanism of evolution in time of
the turbulent flow structures, that has been revealed due to the fact that the flow
phenomena have been described in terms of dominant (most energetic) turbulent
structures (the POD modes in this context).

4 Concluding Remarks
The analysis of the flow field of numerically simulated turbulent channel flow is
performed in terms of flow modes determined with the POD technique. The dynamic
properties of the POD modes are investigated, revealing the basic mechanism of
evolution in time of the turbulent structures. This mechanism consists in the mutual
interaction of two different types of modes, streamwise-independent structures and
bean-shaped, quasi-streamwise modes aligned in the streamwise direction.
