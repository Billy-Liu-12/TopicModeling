Abstract. Electronic and geometrical structures of Fe4Cn(CO)m (n+m≤6) and
Fe4Cn (n=7—16) clusters along with their singly negatively and positively
charged ions are computed using density functional theory with generalized
gradient approximation (DFT-GGA). Isomers with CO bonded directly to the
iron atoms and bonded to a carbon atom chemisorbed on the cluster surface are
optimized for the Fe4C2CO, Fe4C2(CO)2, Fe4C3CO, and Fe4C4CO series. The
computed total energies are used to estimate the energetics of the Boudouard
disproportionation reactions Fe4Cn(CO)m + CO → Fe4Cn+1(CO)m-1 + CO2. Optimizations of the Fe4C4–Fe4C16 clusters have shown that dimers C2 are formed
in the lowest energy states of Fe4C4,, trimers C3 – in Fe4C5 and Fe4C6, tetramers
C4 –in Fe4C7 and Fe4C8, a pentamer C5 – in Fe4C9, and a hexamer C6 – in
Fe4C10. Cn rings attached to a Fe3 face are formed in the lowest energy states of
Fe4Cn beginning with n=11.

1 Introduction
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are expected to have a huge impact on
various technological areas related to fabrication of sensors, composite materials,
hydrogen storages, and computer memories. They can be grown using different methods typically from hydrocarbons [1], alcohol [2], and graphite [3]. The method of
catalytic chemical vapor deposition [4] (CCVD) makes use high temperatures to produce carbon and a supported catalyst [5] to initiate the carbon nanotube growth. Carbon nanotubes grown using this method are often multi-walled while probably more
advantageous for technology are single-walled. This process is cyclic and involves
restoration of catalyst after each production cycle.
The high-pressure high-temperature HiPco [6] method is continuous and its floating or gas-phase catalyst is formed in situ from iron pentacarbonyl Fe(CO)5. Using
carbon monoxide as feedstock is rather intriguing, because CO is one of the most
stable diatomics with the experimental bond strength of 11.09 eV. Carbon nanotubes
produced in this process are always single-walled and are believed [7] to nucleate and
grow via the Boudouard disproportionation reaction CO + CO → CSWCNT + CO2.
The mechanism of carbon nanotube growth is not well understood. Recent experiments [8] using epitaxial precipitation of carbon on catalyst surfaces provided evidence that open tubes drive the carbon nanotube growth. However, Jost et al. [9]

discovered that in the CCVD approach both cap and circumference growth occur. An
empirical model of nucleation [10] in a CCVD process assumes that carbon supersaturates melted catalyst particles and a curved graphene sheet begins to form, which
evolves into a SWCNT cap and subsequently lifts off the catalyst surface. The results
of molecular dynamics simulations [2,11,12] of carbon nanotube growth from carbon
dissolved in a catalyst particle are in agreement with this model. Other theoretical
studies [13,14] dealt with the SWCNT growth from different carbon species including
carbon flakes composed of hexagons and pentagons over Ni catalyst. These computations were performed using pseudopotentials and the plane-wave formalism.

DFT-GGA Simulations of HiPco

In order to gain insight into carbon nucleation in the HiPco process, we have performed all-electron density functional theory calculations with a generalized gradient
approximation (DFT-GGA) on FenC [15], FenCO (n≤6) [16], and Fe4Cn(CO)m
(n+m≤3, both C and CO are attached to Fe4) [17] clusters, and estimated the energies
of Boudouard CO disproportionation reactions Fe4Cn(CO)m+ CO→Fe4Cn+1(CO)m-1+
CO2. The energies found are relatively small and are in the range from -0.26 eV
[Fe4C(CO)+] to +0.74 eV [Fe4(CO)3]. While most of the nanotube growth experiments
to date most likely involve neutral systems, we consider cations and anions in addition to the neutrals. If the reactivity of the cation or anion appears to be much higher
than that of the neutral, it would be advisable to alter the experimental conditions to
enhance the number of cations or anions.
Next, we explored [18] the energetics of CO attachment to a carbon atom that had
already precipitated on an iron cluster due to a preceding Boudouard reaction and
evaluated the energetics of CO disproportionation reactions Fe4Cn(CO)m+
CO→Fe4Cn+1(CO)m-1+CO2 for higher coverage (n+m≤5). We chose Fe4-, Fe4, and
Fe4+ clusters since the Fe4+ cluster is known [19] to catalyze the growth of benzene
from ethylene and cyclopropane in a low-pressure gas-phase process. The number of
iron atoms in clusters formed in the HiPco process ranges from ~10 to ~300 and it is
not clear if smaller iron clusters Fe3 to Fe10 can technologically be effective for the
SWCNT growth because of different restrictions such as coalescence of small clusters. Our computations show that the binding ability of clusters Fe4, Fe5, and Fe6 is
nearly the same. Therefore, one can anticipate that our computations on using computationally manageable Fe4 clusters are capable of reproducing the essentials in initiating the SWCNT growth.
Our computations [18] arrived at several conclusions: (i). CO prefers attachment to
a C atom precipitated on the Fe4 surface in the ground state Fe4C2(CO)+ and
Fe4C3(CO)+ cations while CO is attached directly to iron atoms in the neutral ground
states of the Fe4C2(CO) and Fe4C3(CO) clusters; (ii). Dimerization of carbon atoms
is preferable in Fe4C4, Fe4C5 and its ions, while C3 trimers form in the ground states of
Fe4C6 and its ions; (iii). Formation of a C6 ring catalyzed by Fe4 is energetically unfavorable and it is unlikely that this ring will initiate growth of an SWCNT at least for
an iron cluster of this size; (iv). Antiferromagnetic (AF) states corresponding to small
spin multiplicities may closely approach ferromagnetic states with larger spin multiplicities. For example, the AF states of Fe4C6 with 2S+1=5 and 2S+1=1 are above its

130

ferromagnetic (FM) 2S+1=13 ground state by +0.38 eV and +0.74 eV, respectively.
This is in contrast with Fe4, where AF states were found at energies exceeding 1 eV.

3 Geometry Patterns in Fe4Cn
Since attachment of COs followed by subsequent Boudouard reaction leads to formation of carbon atoms, we consider next the trends in rearrangement of carbon atoms in
the lowest energy isomers of clusters Fe4Cn, n=7-15. As before, computations are
performed at the BPW91 level of DFT-GGA theory where B means the Becke’s exchange [20] and PW91 stands for the Perdew-Wang’s correlation [21] functionals.
We use the 6-311+G* basis set [22]. We have optimized neutral as well as singly
charged negative and positive ions of Fe4Cn for n=7-16 and found that the lowest
energy isomers possess the same geometrical shape independent of the charge state.
Figure 1 shows isomers of Fe4C7, Fe4C7-, and Fe4C7+. As is seen, the lowest energy
isomers are nonplanar and contain a ring formed by C3, C4, and two iron atoms. The
corresponding AF isomers have similar geometrical structures and are placed in total
energy by ~0.5 eV higher, while an isomer of Fe4C7 in which C4 is replaced by a C3
triangle and a C atom is significantly higher. The ground-state spin multiplicities [23,
24] of bare clusters Fe4, Fe4-, Fe4+ are 15, 16, and 12, respectively. Attachment of two
carbon chains decreases the spin multiplicity of Fe4, Fe4-, and does not change the
spin multiplicity of Fe4+. Similar behavior of the spin multiplicities is found for carbon attachments in Fe4Cn for n>7.
The ground states of Fe4C8 and its ions have similar rings as in the ground states of
the Fe4C7 series, where the C3 ring is replaced by a C4 ring. The spin multiplicity of
Fe4C8 and Fe4C8- are the same as in Fe4C7 and Fe4C7-, respectively, while the ground
state of the Fe4C8+ cation is AF and has 2S+1=5. This trend continues in the Fe4C9
series. The ground-state Fe4C9 neutral is presented in Fig. 2 and possesses a chair-type
geometrical structure.
In order to form the ground-state Fe4C10 neutral, an additional carbon atom attaches
to the C5 unit and attaches to Fe4 from below. In Fe4C11, a C11 ring attached to a Fe3
face corresponds to the lowest energy isomer. Let us note, that a C10 ring attached to a
Fe3 face forms an isomer of Fe4C10 that is +1.86 eV higher in total energy than the
isomer shown in Fig. 2. In the lowest energy isomer of Fe4C16, a carbon C16 ring attaches to a Fe3 face (see Fig. 2). This trend continues in Fe4C17, and is expected to
stop at C20 where bowl, cage, and ring isomers are found [25] to be energetically
indistinguishable.
The dependence of total energies of Fe4Cn on the spin multiplicities, or, in other
words on excess spin densities at iron sites, shows no clear pattern. Thus, the difference in total energies of Fe4C7 when moving from the lowest 2S+1=13 state to the
lowest 2S+1=1 state is 1.00 eV, that is, the same as in the bare iron cluster Fe4, while
for Fe4 C6 and Fe4C12 small differences of 0.38 and 0.50 eV are found, respectively.
Figure 2 shows also the ground state of the corresponding neutral Cn species optimized at the same BPW91/6-311+G* level of theory. In agreement with experiment
[26], we found that ground-state Cn and Cn- are linear for n=3-9 and have ring forms
of C2v, C2h, or Cs symmetry for n=10-20. In the cation series, the ring configurations
are the most stable ones beginning with n=8.

Fig. 1. Bond lengths are in Å, excess spin densities at iron atoms are in electrons, and M is the
spin multiplicity 2S+1. AF means state where excess spin densities at iron sites are coupled
antiferromagnetically.

In accord with this geometrical shape change in Cn, the carbon atoms forms dimers,
trimers, tetramers and pentamers in Fe4Cn for n=4-9, a tetramer and an hexamer in
intermediate Fe4C10, and rings beginning with n=11.
Since the ring structures of Cn are only preferable up to n=20, one expects that further carbon attachment would lead to carbon sheets, which is next step toward the
growth of a carbon nanotube. The computations of Fe4Cn for n>16 are currently under
way.
Let us consider briefly the thermodynamic stability of Fe4Cn and Cn taking first
Fe4C7 as an example:

C10, C12, and C16. Bond lengths are in Å, excess spin densities at iron atoms are in electrons,
and M is the spin multiplicity 2S+1. Note that pure Cn are 0.8 scaled in order to fit the figure.

Fe4C7 → Fe4C4 + C3 requires 5.29 eV
Fe4C4→ Fe4 + C4 requires 6.47 eV
Complimentary channels show a similar trend of a larger binding energy for C4
than C3.
Fe4C7 → Fe4C3 + C4 requires 6.36 eV
Fe4C3→ Fe4 + C3 requires 5.40 eV

The channel C3 + C4→ C7 produces 6.18 eV, which results in the energy of the
Fe4C7 → Fe4 + C7 channel of 5.58 eV. Of course, the same energy is obtained in the
direct computation Etot(Fe4C7)- Etot(Fe4)- Etot(C7). One sees that the binding energies
of Cn to Fe4 or Fe4Cm (n, m = 3 or 4) are rather similar to the energy gained from C3 +
C4→ C7.
Beginning with n=11, the carbons form a ring and the additional C—C bonds
may influence thermodynamic patterns. Let us consider, as an example, the decay
channels of Fe4C16.
Fe4C16 → Fe4C8 + C8 requires 5.54 eV
Fe4C8→ Fe4 + C8
requires 6.84 eV
Fe4C16→ Fe4 + C16 requires 4.27 eV
That is, the detachment of C8 from the ring in Fe4C16 is less costly than the detachment of C8 from the iron cluster in Fe4C8 and the C16 ring is less bound to Fe4 than
are the two C4 chains in the Fe4C8 cluster. The ring formation becomes favorable due
to the high energy of dimerization C8 + C8→ C16, which is 8.11 eV according to our
computations at the same level of theory, and not from a stronger bonding of the ring
to the cluster.

4 Conclusion
The results of our computations using density functional theory on Fe4Cn, n=7-16,
revealed that
(i) The carbon atoms forms two chains attached in such a way as to form a ring
containing two iron atoms for n=7, 8 and 9.
(ii) Carbon atoms form rings on the top of a Fe3 face for n =11-16.
(iii) Fe4C10 presents an intermediate state between these (i) and (ii) where C4 and C6
do not form a ring.
(iv) The trend in preferable deposition of carbon atoms on the Fe4 cluster is similar
to the trend in geometrical shape of free Cn species, where the linear—ring transition occurs at n=10.
(v) The iron catalyst in the HiPco process reduces significantly the barrier for the
Boudouard reaction which releases carbon atoms followed by their reconstruction into rings at the catalyst surface. After the ring template is created on the
catalyst, it is likely that all subsequent carbon atom production on the catalyst
leads to growth of the SWNT. However, there could well be a tradeoff between
growth rate and the number of defects.
