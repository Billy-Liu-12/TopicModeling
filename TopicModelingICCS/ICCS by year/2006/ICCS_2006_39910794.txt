Abstract. The Block Jacobi preconditioning technique based on Block Broyden method is introduced to solve nonlinear equations. This paper theoretically
analyzes the time complexity of this algorithm as well as the unpreconditioned
one. Numerical experiments are used to show that Block Jacobi preconditioning
method, compared with the unpreconditioned one, has faster solving speed and
better performance under different dimensions and numbers of blocks.

1 Introduction
In the past few years, a number of books entirely devoted to iterative methods for
nonlinear systems have appeared. The Block Broyden Algorithm was proposed and
analyzed in References [1, 2]. However, the convergence speed of this algorithm is
affected to some extent, for the information among the nodes is always lost. Hence,
[3]
seeking for proper preconditioning methods is one of the effective ways to solve this
problem. Some preconditioners have been proposed and discussed in Reference [4].
This paper introduces Block Jacobi preconditioning technique based on Block
Broyden method and we name this method as BJBB. It also analyzes time complexity
and applies BJBB method to nonlinear systems arising from the Bratu problem.

2 Block Jacobi Method Based on Block Broyden Algorithm
2.1 General Remarks
In the following discussion, we are concerned with the problem of solving the large
system of nonlinear equations as (1):

here L (n) means the complexity of solving q block linear equations Bi si

and R (n) is the calculative cost in step 2.3, Algorithm 2.1.1. From (3) we can know
that the value of U differs in L (n) for various methods.
For unpreconditioned method, we can deduce the value of L (n) as follows:

3 Numerical Experiments
Suppose a nonlinear partial differential equation can be written as

⎧− Δ u + u x + λe u = f ,
( x, y ) ∈ Ω = [0,1] × [0,1] .

⎩u |∂Ω = 0

It is known as the Bratu problem and has been used as a test problem by Yang in
[2] and Jiang in [4]. In the following tests, we suppose N=110, 150 and 180, giving
three grids, M1, M2 and M3, with 12100, 22500, 32400 unknowns, respectively. And
we set block number q1=2000, q2=800 and q3=2500 for each grid. Table 1, 2, and 3
show the number of nonlinear iterations, which is denoted by “k” and the sum of
numbers of iterations during the i-th nonlinear iteration, which is denoted by “k[i]”.

To judge the performance of each method, we use data shown in Table 1 as an example. During the 1500–th iteration, the following can be known:

k p = 3533 , k n = 7243 , q1 = 2000 , n = M 1 / q1 = 12100 / 2000 = 6
According to (4), we get Ln ( n) = 3433182 for the unpreconditioned method.
According to (5), we get

L p (n) = 3366642 for BJBB method. Thus we find that

L p (n) < Ln (n) , so the performance of BJBB method is much better than the unpreconditioned one.

4 Conclusions
We have proposed Block Jacobi preconditioning technique based on Block Broyden
Method for solving nonlinear systems. It shows evidently some advantages to combine Block Broyden Algorithm with preconditioners.
