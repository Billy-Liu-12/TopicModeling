Abstract. The general aim of this paper is to study the spatio-temporal
modeling techniques which can efficiently represent multiple moving objects' in
video databases. The traditional schemes only consider direction property, time
interval property, and spatial relationship property for modeling moving objects'
trajectories. But, our scheme also takes into account on distance property,
conceptual location information, and related object information so that we may
improve a retrieval accuracy to measure a similarity between two moving
objects as well as them. As its application, we implement the Content- and
2
Semantic-based Soccer Video Retrieval (CS VR) system by using MS Visual
2
C++ and DirectX for indexing and searching on soccer video data. The CS VR
helps users to easily extract the trajectory information of soccer ball form
soccer video data semi-automatically as well as to conveniently retrieve the
results acquired by sketching query trajectory with mouse button.

1 Introduction
The initial research issues on the content-based video retrieval have highly
concentrated on data representation schemes which can efficiently model content
itself extracted from video data [1-5]. However, for handling a large amount of
multimedia data, it is required to provide schemes with good retrieval performance on
a variety of user queries. Thus, we propose a new spatio-temporal modeling technique
which can efficiently represent multiple moving objects in video databases. The
traditional schemes only consider direction property, time interval property, and
spatial relationship property for modeling moving objects' trajectories. However, our
scheme also takes into account on distance property, conceptual location information,
and related object information (e.g. player name having a soccer ball) so that we may
improve retrieval accuracy to measure a similarity between two moving objects as
well as them. Therefore, the proposed spatio-temporal scheme can support contentbased retrieval using moving objects' trajectories as well as semantics-based retrieval
using concepts which are acquired through the co nceptual location information of
moving objects. As its application, we design and implement the Content- and
Semantic-based Soccer Video Retrieval (CS2VR) system. Finally, in our performance
study, our scheme yields substantially better retrieval performance compared to
existing related work in term of retrieval effectiveness.

A Novel Approach for Similarity Measure Schemes Based on Multiple Moving Objects

233

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a new spatio-temporal
modeling scheme for representing multiple moving objects; Based on our modeling
scheme, the similarity measure functions for multiple moving objects is described in
Section 3; For its applications, the Content-based Soccer Video Retrieval (CS2VR)
system is presented in Section 4; and Section 5 covers conclusion with brief
summary.

2 Spatio-temporal Modeling Scheme
Since video data have both spatial and temporal information, they should consider
both spatial [6] and temporal [7] relationships to represent moving objects in an
effective way. For this, we propose a new spatio-temporal representation scheme for
modeling the multiple trajectories among several moving objects. At first, spatiotemporal representation scheme for single trajectory composed of only one moving
object is introduced.
Definition 1. Motion property information for a moving object A over all the time
intervals, MPS(A), is defined as follows:
MPS(A) = {Mi(A) | i = 0, …, n-1} = {M0(A), M1(A), …, Mn-1(A)}
Definition 2. A motion property for a moving object A over time interval Ii, Mi(A), is
defined as follows:
Mi(A) = (Ri(A), Di(A), Ii(A))
Here, Ri(A) is a moving direction over time interval Ii (=[ti,ti+1]) and is represented as
a real angle with a range of 0 to 360 degree. Di(A) is a moving distance over Ii and is
described as an absolute Euclidean distance or a relative distance. Ii(A) means a time
interval from the start time to the end time while the moving object A is moving.
Definition 3. Stationary property information for a moving object A over all the time
instances, SPS(A), is defined as follows:
SPS(A) = {Si(A) | i = 0, … , n} = {S0(A), S1(A), …, Sn(A)}
Definition 4. A stationary property for a moving object A at time ti, Si(A), is defined
as follows:
Si(A) = ([Li(A)], [Oi(A)])
Here, Li(A) is a location information of the moving object A. The location
information describes a real location in coordinates or a semantic-based location
according to a real application, e.g., penalty area or goal area in the soccer game.
Oi(A) is an object information related with the moving object A, e.g., actor or owner
having the moving object A. Here, [] means an optional operator.
For the single trajectory of a moving object A, it is possible to combine a motion
property (Definition 1 and 2) with a stationary property (Definition 3 and 4). As a
result, the information of a single trajectory is defined as follows.

Definition 5. For a given ordered list of time interval I0, I1, …, In-1, the single
trajectory information of a moving object A, ST(A), is defined as follows:
ST(A) = MPS(A) + SPS(A)
We define multiple trajectories as the trajectories of two or more moving objects.
However, since the multiple trajectories can be represented by the combination of the
trajectory between two moving objects, we first define a relationship trajectory
between two objects.
Definition 6. Let at least one of object A and object B be a moving object. Motion
property information for A and B over all the time interval, MPM(A, B), is defined as
follows:
MPM(A, B) = {Mi(A, B) | i = 0, … , n-1} = {M0(A, B), M1(A, B), …, Mn-1(A, B)}
Definition 7. Let at least one of object A and object B be a moving object. A motion
property for A and B over time interval Ii ([ti,ti+1]), Mi(A, B), is defined as follows:
Mi(A, B) = (Di(A, B), Ii(A, B))
Here, Di(A, B) is a relative moving distance of A to B over Ii and is ranged from 0 to
100. That is, Di(A, B) is 50 in case the moving distance of A is the same as that of B.
Di(A, B) is ranged from 51 to 100 in case the moving distance of A is greater than that
of B while it is near to 0 as the moving distance of A is less than that of B. Ii(A, B) is
the same as single trajectory.
Definition 8. Let at least one of object A and object B be a moving object. Stationary
property information for A and B over all the time instances, SPM(A, B), is defined
as follows:
SPM(A, B) = {Si(A, B) | i = 0, … , n} = {S0(A, B), S1(A, B), …, Sn(A, B)}
Definition 9. Let at least one of object A and object B be a moving object. A
stationary property for A and B at time ti, Si(A, B), is defined as follows:
Si(A, B) = ([Li(A)], [Oi(A)], ([Li(B)], [Oi(B)], Ti(A, B), Ri(A, B))
Here, Li(A) and Li(B) are the location information of moving object A and B,
respectively. Oi(A) and Oi(B) are the actors having moving objects A and B,
respectively. Ti(A, B) is a spatial (topological) relations on XY-coordinates from A to
B, being represented as one of seven topological relations operator : FA(FarAway),
DJ(DisJoint), ME(MEet), OL(OverLap), CL(is-inCLuded-by), IN(INclude), and
SA(SAme). Finally, Ri(A, B) means a directional relations from A to B and is ranged
from 0 to 360 degree.
For a relationship trajectory between A and B, it is possible to combine a motion
property (Definition 6 and 7) with a stationary property (Definition 8 and 9). As a
result, the relationship trajectory information is defined as follows.
Definition 10. Let at least one of object A and object B be a moving object. For a
given ordered list of time interval I0, I1, …, In-1, the relationship trajectory information
between A and B, RT(A, B), is defined as follows:

RT(A, B) = MPM(A, B) + SPM(A, B)
Based on Definition 5 and 10, the multiple trajectory information of two or more
moving objects, MT(A1, A2, …, An), can be represented by a combination of the
relationship trajectory information (RT) and the single trajectory information (ST).
Definition 11. Among objects A1, A2, …,An, let i be the number of moving objects
and j be the number of stationary objects, i.e., n=i+j. The multiple trajectory
information of A1, A2, …, An, MT(A1, A2, …, An), is defined as follows:
MT(A1 , A 2 ,..., A n ) = {ST (A p ) | p = 1, ... , i} + {RT(A q , A q +1 ) | q = 1, ... , k}

, k = n C2 − j C2

Here ST(Ai) is the single trajectory information of an object Ai. RT(Ak, Ak+1) is the
relationship trajectory information between object Ak and Ak+1 where k is the number
of relationship trajectories between two moving objects as well as between a moving
object and a stationary object.

3 Similarity Measure
Based on our spatio-temporal modeling for moving objects’ trajectories, we define a
similarity measure for a single trajectory and multiple trajectories, respectively. Since
we measure a similarity between i-th motion in query trajectory Q and j-th motion in
data trajectory S, we define a distance function between two motions.
Definition 12. A distance function, dSdf(q[i], s[j]), to measure the similarity between
the arbitrary motion s[i] of a data trajectory S and the arbitrary motion q[j] of a query
trajectory Q is defined as follows.
ddis(s[i,2], q[j,2]) = | s[i, 2] - q[j, 2] |
if | s[i, 1] - q[j, 1] | > 180 then dang(s[i, 1], q[j, 1]) = (360 - | s[i, 1] - q[j, 1] | )
else dang(s[i, 1], q[j, 1]) = | s[i, 1] - q[j, 1] |
dSdf(s[i], q[j])= ( ((dang / 180) * α) + ((ddis/100) * β) )
Here, dang is a distance function for the direction (angle) property for all the motions
of a trajectory and ddis is a distance function for the distance property. s[i, 1] and s[i,
2] are the direction and the distance value of the i-th motion in a trajectory S,
respectively. α and β mean the weight of the direction and the distance, respectively,
when α+β=1.0.
Definition 13. Given a single trajectory S={s[0], s[1], …, s[m]} and a query
trajectory Q={q[0], q[1], …, q[n]} (1≤n≤m), the similarity between trajectory S and
Q, STsim(S, Q), by using definition 12 is defined as follows.

Next, to measure similarity between multiple trajectories, we first define the similarity
measure for a relationship trajectory between two trajectories. For this, we make use
of topological relationships between multiple moving objects as well as moving
direction and moving distance. Hence, we define a distance function using threedimensional properties as follows.
Definition 14. A distance function, dRdf(q[i], s[j]), to measure the similarity between
the arbitrary motion s[i] of a data trajectory S and the arbitrary motion q[j] of a query
trajectory Q is defined as follows.
dtop(s[i,3], q[j,3]) = (top_dist(s[i, 3], q[j, 3]))2
ddis(s[i,2], q[j,2]) = | s[i, 2] - q[j, 2] |
if | s[i, 1] - q[j, 1] | > 180 then dang(s[i, 1], q[j, 1]) = (360 - | s[i, 1] - q[j, 1] | )
else dang(s[i, 1], q[j, 1]) = | s[i, 1] - q[j, 1] |
dRdf(s[i], q[j])= ( ((dang / 180) * α) + ((ddis/100) * β ) + ((dtop/25)*γ) )
Here dang is a distance function for the direction (angle) property for all the motions of
a trajectory, ddis is a distance function for the distance property and dtop is a distance
function for the topology property. s[i, 1], s[i, 2] and s[i, 3] are the angle, the distance
and the topology value of the i-th motion in a multiple trajectory S, respectively. α, β
and γ mean the weight of the angle, the distance and the topology, respectively, when
α+β+γ=1.0. Also, top_dist(a, b) means the similarity distance for topological relations
between a and b.
Definition 15. Given a relationship trajectory S={s[0], s[1], …, s[m]} and a query
trajectory Q={q[0], q[1], …, q[n]} (1≤n≤m), the similarity between trajectory S and
Q, RTsim(S, Q), by using definition 14 is defined as follows.

RTsim (S, Q) = MAX{

(∀ j ,0 ≤ j ≤ m − n )

A list of multiple trajectories of at least two or more moving objects, MT(A1, A2, …,
An), can be represented as a combination of single trajectory(ST) and relationship
trajectories(RT).
Definition 16. Let us suppose that i and j is the number of moving objects and
stationary objects, respectively (n=i+j). The similarity for multiple trajectories of
objects A1, A2, …, An, MT(A1, A2, …, An), is calculated as follows:
i

, k = n C2 − j C2

Here STsim(Ai) is the similarity value of single trajectory of object Ai. RTsim(Ak, Ak+1)
is the similarity value of relationship trajectories between objects Ak and Ak+1 where k

is the number of relationship trajectories between two moving objects as well as
between a moving object and a stationary object.

4 CS2VR System
We make use of soccer video data as its application since there are many trajectories
data of salient objects such as soccer ball, player, and referee in the soccer ground
field. Additionally, the trajectory information plays an important role in indexing
soccer video data and detecting the scene with ‘goal in’ in soccer video database.
Therefore, we implement the Content- and Semantic-based Soccer Video Retrieval
(CS2VR) under Windows 2003 Server O.S with Pentium III-800 and 512 MB
memory by using Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and DirectX so that we can support
the indexing and searching on soccer video data. Figure 1 first shows a Graphic User
Interface (GUI) for soccer video indexing which can help users to easily extract the
trajectory information of soccer ball from soccer video data semi-automatically, e.g.
moving direction, moving distance, # of frame, player name, and so on. We
implement it so as to work well under Window platform. Our GUI for soccer video
indexing is composed of two windows: main window and soccer ground window. The
former is to browse raw soccer video data formatted as mpeg (*.mpeg) and to extract
the trajectory information of soccer ball and main player. The latter is to transform the
location of soccer ball on raw video through the main window data into an absolute
location on the coordinate of soccer ground field. For this, we make use of ‘affine
transformation algorithm’ which is mainly used in computer vision or image
processing fields [8].
Figure 2 depicts a GUI for soccer video retrieval which can help users to retrieve the
results acquired in soccer video databases. We implemented it by JAVA application in
order to work well independently without regard to system platform. We can

provide three types of user query, that is, trajectory-based query, semantic-based
query, and actor-based query as shown in the left part of Figure 2. The trajectorybased query is based on the trajectory of moving objects such as soccer ball and
player as the following query: “Finds all video shots whose trajectory is similar to the
trajectory sketched by a user on soccer video retrieval interface”. The semanticbased query is based on important semantics such as ‘penalty kick’, ‘corner kick’ and
‘goal in’ in soccer video databases: “Finds all video shots including a scene ‘goal in’.
Finally, the actor-based query is based on the interested player name such as
‘Ronaldo’, ‘Rivaldo’ and ‘Zidane’ in soccer video databases: “Finds all video shots
including a scene ‘goal in’ by planer name ‘Ronaldo’. The retrieved results on a user
query are provided in the form of trajectory images with the similar trajectory as
shown in the right part of Figure 2. We can browse them in the order of the degree of
relevance to a user query. The real soccer video shot corresponding to the trajectory
image retrieved can be shown by clicking its trajectory image with the mouse button.

5 Conclusions
We proposed a new spatio-temporal modeling scheme which can efficiently represent
multiple moving objects in video databases. In order to improve retrieval accuracy to
measure a similarity between two moving objects, our scheme took into account on
distance property, conceptual location information, and related object information
while the traditional schemes only consider direction property, time interval property,
and spatial relations property for modeling moving objects' trajectories. We designed
and implemented the Content- and Semantic-based Soccer Video Retrieval (CS2VR)
system as its application. As future study, it is necessary to research on indexing
technique to support good retrieval efficiently when the amount of multiple moving

objects is very large and STQL(Spatio-Temporal Query Language) to make query
formally for moving objects in spatio-temporal databases like SQL.
