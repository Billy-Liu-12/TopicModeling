Abstract. Adaptive, locally reﬁned and locally adjusted meshes are
preferred over uniform meshes for capturing singular or localised solutions. Roughly speaking, for a given degree of freedom a solution associated with adaptive, locally reﬁned and locally adjusted meshes is more
accurate than the solution given by uniform meshes. In this work, we
answer the question which meshes are better conditioned. We found, for
approximately same degree of freedom (same size of matrix), it is easier
to solve a system of equations associated with an adaptive mesh.

Introduction

Uniform, locally adjusted, adaptive and locally reﬁned meshes are shown in
Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Here, for each mesh the number of cells (or
degree of freedom) are approximately 1024 (25 × 25 ). Let us consider the steady
state pressure equation of a single phase ﬂow in a porous medium Ω [1]
− div (K grad p) = f

in Ω

and p(x, y) = pD

on ∂ΩD .

Here, Ω is a polyhedral domain in R2 , the source function f is assumed to
be in L2 (Ω) and the diagonal tensor coeﬃcient K(x, y) is positive deﬁnite and
piecewise constant. K (permeability) is allowed to be discontinuous in space. We
are discretizating the equation (1) on the meshes (see Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6) by
the method of Finite Volumes [1, 3, 7, 8]. For discretization of the problem (1) on
uniform and localised meshes (see the Figures 3 and 4), we refer to the References
[1, 7, 8]. Discretization of the equation (1) on adaptive and locally reﬁned meshes
is given in the following References [3, 5]. Finite Volume discretization of the
problem (1) on a mesh results in a matrix system A ph = b. Here, A is symmetric
positive deﬁnite matrix associated with a mesh.
Let us deﬁne a problem to be solved on the four meshes. Let the domain be
Ω = [−1, 1]× [−1, 1] (see Figure 1). It is divided into four sub-domains according
to the permeability K (see the Figures 1 and 2). The permeability K is a positive
constant in each of the sub-domains and is discontinuous across the surfaces of
sub-domains. Let the permeability in the sub-domain Ωi be Ki . Assuming that

K1 = K3 = R and K2 = K4 = 1.0. K1 , K2 , K3 and K4 refers to the permeabilities
in the subdomains Ω1 , Ω2 , Ω3 and Ω4 , respectively. The parameter R is given
below. Let the exact solution in the polar form be [5]
p(r, θ) = rγ η(θ) ,

where the parameter γ denotes the singularity in the solution [5] and it depends
on the permeability distribution in the domain (see Figure 2 for the permeability
for the singularity γ = 0.1). η(θ) is given as

It can be shown that solution p (given by equation (2)) barely belongs in the
fractional Sobolev space H1+κ (Ω) with κ < γ (cf. [6]).

For the singularity γ = 0.1, the parameters are

ρ ≈ 0.7854 and σ ≈ −14.9225 .

We solve the problem (1) on the four meshes. The exact solution is given by
the equation (2). We enforce the solution inside the domain by the Dirichlet
boundary condition and the source term. For solving discrete system of equations formed on the meshes, we use the Conjugate Gradient (CG) solver (see [4]).
Table 1 presents eigenvalues and condition numbers of the matrix systems associated with the diﬀerent meshes. Note that in this table, the largest eigenvalue
on all four meshes is approximately same. However, the smallest eigenvalue associated with the adaptive mesh is greater than the smallest eigenvalues associated
with other three meshes. When solving the Symmetric Positive Deﬁnite (SPD)
linear system A ph = b with the CG, the smallest eigenvalues of the matrix
slowes down the convergence (cf. [4]). Several techniques have been proposed
in the literature to remove bad eﬀect of the smallest eigenvalue (see [2, 4, and
references therein]). Convergence of the CG solver for these the four systems are
shown in the Figure 7. It is clear from the Table 1 and the Figure 7 that it is
easier to solve a matrix system associated with an adaptive mesh than to solve
systems associated with uniform, localised and locally reﬁned meshes.

Conclusions

We have shown that it is easier to solve a matrix system associated with an
adaptive mesh than solving systems associated with uniform, localised and locally reﬁned meshes. The adaptive mesh is generated by equal distribution of
the ﬂuxes over all the cells in the mesh. Why do equal distribution of ﬂuxes is
create meshes which are better conditioned ? Or, why do equal distribution of
ﬂuxes remove bad eﬀect of small eigenvalue ? Answers to these questions can
help in designing new preconditioners or improving existing preconditioners.
