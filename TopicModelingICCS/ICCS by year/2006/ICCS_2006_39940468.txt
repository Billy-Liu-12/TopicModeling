Abstract. Association mining cannot find such type of patterns, “the conditional probability that a customer purchasing A is likely to also purchase B is
not only greater than the given threshold, but also much greater than the probability that a customer purchases only B . In other words, the sale of A can increase the likelihood of the sale of B .” Such kind of patterns are both associated and correlated. Therefore, in this paper, we combine association with correlation in the mining process to discover both associated and correlated patterns. A new interesting measure corr-confidence is proposed for rationally
evaluating the correlation relationships. This measure not only has proper
bounds for effectively evaluating the correlation degree of patterns, but also is
suitable for mining long patterns. Our experimental results show that the mining
combined association with correlation is quite a valid approach to discovering
both associated and correlated patterns.

1 Introduction
Data mining is defined as the process of discovering significant and potentially useful
patterns in large volume of data. Although association or correlation mining can find
many interesting patterns, the following two kinds of patterns generated from only
association or correlation mining are misleading or meaningless, because neither of
the two cases can lead to the result that the sale of A increases the likelihood of the
sale of B .
1. A and B are associated but not correlated, that is, although the conditional probability that a customer purchasing A is likely to also purchase B is greater than the
given threshold, the probability that a customer purchases only B is not significantly
less the conditional probability.
2. A and B are correlated but not associated, that is, although whether a customer
purchases B is significantly influenced by whether she/he purchases A , the probability that a customer purchases only B is much greater than the conditional probability
that a customer purchasing A is likely to also purchase B .
If pattern AB satisfies the following two conditions, then the sale of
crease the likelihood of the sale of B .

1. The conditional probability that a customer purchasing A is likely to also purchase B is great enough.
2. The probability that a customer purchases only B is significantly less than the
conditional probability that a customer purchasing A is likely to also purchase B .

Mining Both Associated and Correlated Patterns

For example, if P(B)=88% and P(B/A)=90% , then the sale of A cannot increase the
likelihood of the sale of B , even though the conditional probability P(B/A)=90% is
much greater than the given threshold. In this case, A and B are associated but not
correlated. If P(B)=90% and P(B/A)=20% , then the sale of A cannot increase the likelihood of the sale of B , even if the purchase of B is influenced by the purchase of A .
It is the case that A and B are correlated but not associated.
Patterns which satisfy the first condition are associated and patterns which satisfy
the second condition are correlated, so a pattern which satisfies the two conditions is
both associated and correlated. Therefore, in this paper, we combine association with
correlation in the mining process to discover both associated and correlated patterns.
One difficulty is how to select a proper interestingness measure that can effectively
evaluate the association degree of patterns, as there is still no universally accepted
best measure for judging interesting patterns [6]. Omiccinski [5] introduced three
alternative interestingness measures, called any-confidence, all-confidence and bond
for mining associations. Won-young kim [9] and Young-koo lee [10] used allconfidence to discover interesting patterns although both of them defined a pattern
which satisfies the given minimum all-confidence as a correlated pattern. Allconfidence can be computed efficiently using its downward closure property [5], so it
is employed for association mining in this paper.
Another difficulty is that there are few measures which not only have proper
bounds for effectively evaluating the correlation degree of patterns but also are suitable for mining long correlated patterns. The most commonly employed method for
correlation mining is that of two-dimensional contingency table analysis of categorical data using the chi-square statistic as a measure of significance. Brin et al. [2] analyzed contingency tables to generate correlation rules that identify statistical correlation in both the presence and absence of items in patterns. H. Liu et al. [3] analyzed
contingency tables to discover unexpected and interesting patterns that have a low
lever of support and a high level of confidence. Bing Liu et al. [1] used contingency
tables for pruning and summarizing the discovered correlations etc. Although the low
chi-squared value (less than the cutoff value, e.g. 3.84 at the 95% significance lever
[4]) efficiently indicates that all patterns AB , AB , AB , AB are independent, that is, A
and B , A and B , A and B , A and B are all independent. The high chi-squared
value only indicates that at least one of patterns AB , AB , AB , AB is dependent, so it is
possible that AB is independent, i.e. A and B are independent, in spite of the high
chi-squared value as showed in experimental results. Therefore, when only the presence of items is considered, in other words, when only the sale of A and B is concerned, the chi-squared value is not reasonable for measuring the dependence degree
of A and B . For other commonly used measures, the measure P ( AB ) P ( A) P ( B ) [2]
does not have proper bounds. P ( AB ) − P ( A) P ( B ) P ( A) P ( B )(1 − P ( A))(1 − P ( B )) [8] is
not suitable for generating long patterns. P ( AB ) − P ( A) P ( B ) [7] is not rational when
P ( AB ) is compared with P ( A) P ( B ) . For example, if P ( AB ) = 0.02 , P ( A) P ( B ) = 0.01 ,
P ( A′B ′) = 0.99 and P ( A′) P ( B ′ ) = 0.98 , then P ( AB ) − P ( A) P ( B ) = P ( A′B ′) − P ( A′) P ( B ′ ) . The
correlation degree of A and B is equal to the correlation degree of A′ and B ′
by P ( AB ) − P ( A) P ( B ) . However P ( AB ) / P ( A) P ( B ) = 2 and P ( A′B ′) / P ( A′) P ( B ′) = 1.01 , the

470

correlation degree of A and B is evidently higher than the correlation degree of A′
and B ′ . In this paper, a new interestingness measure corr-confidence is proposed for
correlation mining. This measure not only has proper bounds for effectively evaluating the correlation degree of patterns, but also is suitable for mining long patterns.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, some related concepts are given and an algorithm is developed for discovering both associatedcorrelated patterns. We report our experimental and performance results in section 3.
Section 4 concludes the paper.

2 Mining Both Associated and Correlated Patterns
This section first formalizes some related concepts and then gives an algorithm for
efficiently discovering all both associated and correlated patterns.
In statistical theory, A1, A2 , L, An are independent if ∀k and ∀1 ≤ i1 < i2 < L < ik ≤ n ,

In this paper, let all patterns have more than one item. A new measure corrconfidence (denoted as ρ ) is given as follows using (1):
1. If a pattern has two items, such as pattern AB , then
ρ ( AB ) = P ( AB ) − P ( A) P ( B ) P ( AB ) + P ( A) P ( B )

(2)

2. If a pattern has more than two items, such as pattern X = {i1i2 L in } , then
ρ( X ) =

P(i1i2 ,L, in ) − P(i1 )P(i2 ) LP(in )
P(i1i2 ,L, in ) + P(i1 )P(i2 ) LP(in )

,

(n ≥ 1) .

From (2) and (3), we can see that ρ has two bounds, i.e. −1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 .
Let η be a given minimum corr-confidence, if pattern X has two items

(3)

A, B

and

ρ ( AB ) > η , then X is called a correlated pattern or A and B are called correlated,
else A and B are called independent. If pattern X has more than two items, we define a correlated pattern and an independent pattern as follows:

Definition 1 (a correlated pattern). Pattern X is called a correlated pattern, if and
only if there exists a pattern Y which satisfies Y ⊆ X and ρ (Y ) > η .
Definition 2 (an independent pattern). If pattern X is not a correlated pattern, then
it is called an independent pattern.

By the definition 1, we conclude that (1) if pattern X is a correlated pattern, any
super pattern of X is a correlated pattern and pattern X must have a subset which
is a correlated pattern. (2) pattern X must have two subsets A and B which are
correlated.

Mining Both Associated and Correlated Patterns

We define an associated pattern using the measure all-confidence [5].
Let T = {i1, i2 , L, im } be a set of m distinct literals called items and D be a set of
variable length transactions over T . Each transaction contains a set of items,
{i j1 , i j2 , L , i jk } ⊂ T . A transaction also has an associated unique identifier. Pattern
X is a subset of T . Let p ( X ) be a power set of pattern X . The interestingness
measure all-confidence (denoted as α ) of pattern X is defined as follows [5]:
α =

{d d ∈ D ∧ X ⊂ d }

(4)

MAX {i ∀l ( l ∈ p ( X ) ∧ l ≠ φ ∧ l ≠ X ∧ i = { d d ∈ D ∧ l ⊂ d } )}

Definition 3 (an associated pattern). A pattern is called an associated pattern, if its
all-confidence is greater than or equal to the given minimum all-confidence.
Definition 4 (an associated-correlated pattern). A pattern is called an associatedcorrelated pattern if it is not only an associated pattern but also a correlated pattern.
Let pattern X be an associated-correlated pattern, then it must have two subsets A
and B which satisfy the condition that the sale of A can increase the likelihood of the
sale of B .
Example 1. For the transaction database TDB in Table 1, we have α ( AC ) = 2 3 and
α (CE ) = 2 3 , so both AC and CE have all-confidence 2 3 . We also have
ρ ( AC ) =

P ( AC ) − P ( A) P ( C )
P ( AC ) + P ( A ) P ( C )

=

1

and

ρ ( CE ) =

P ( CE ) − P ( C ) P ( E )
P ( CE ) + P ( C ) P ( E )

=

1

.

19

Let the given minimum all-confidence be 0.5 and the given minimum corrconfidence be 0.1 , then both AC and CE are associated patterns. However, pattern
AC is a correlated pattern and pattern CE is an independent pattern. Therefore pattern
AC is an associated-correlated pattern and pattern CE is an associated but not correlated pattern. From P ( A / C ) = 2 / 3, P ( A) = 2 / 5 , we can see that the sale of C can increase the likelihood of the sale of A . Meanwhile, P (C / A) = 1, P ( C ) = 3 / 5 , we can also
see that the sale of A can also increase the likelihood of the sale of C . However P ( C / E ) = 2 / 3 , and P ( C ) = 3 / 5 , the sale of E cannot evidently increase the likelihood of the sale of C .

We mine all frequent associated-correlated patterns in two steps. First, we discover
all frequent associated patterns, and then test whether they are correlated. We use a
level-wise algorithm for discovering all frequent associated-correlated patterns.

3 Experiments
In this section, we report our experimental results. All experiments are performed on
two kinds of datasets: 1. a dense dataset, Mushroom characteristic dataset, which
consists of 8,124 transactions, each with an average length of 23 items. 2. a sparse
dataset, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula dataset, which consists of
4,643 formulas with 21689 kinds of medicine involved, each with an average length
of 10 kinds of medicine. TCM formula dataset is obtained from Information Institute
of China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Table 2 shows the chi-squared value and the corr-confidence of partly item pairs in
mushroom dataset and TCM formula dataset. For example, 3<->39 is an item pair.
The number after “:” indicates the corr-confidence and the chi-squared value respectively. In mushroom database, item pair 34<->91 has chi-squared value 7111.33 and
corr-confidence 0.0120186. Item pair 3<->39 has chi-squared value 26.5377 and corrconfidence 0.0207035. Although the chi-squared value of item pair 34<->91 is very
high, the corr-confidence of item pair 34<->91 is lower than the one of item pair 3<>39. Therefore, item pair 3<->39 has a higher level dependence than item pair 34<>91 according to the corr-confidence. The chi-squared statistic simultaneously and
uniformly takes into account all possible combinations of the presence and absence of
the various attributes being examined as a group, so when only the presence of items
in patterns is concerned, the high chi-squared value cannot infer that items in patterns
are highly dependent as shown in Table 2.
Figure 1 (A) shows the runtime with limit the length of patterns and without limit
the length of patterns as the minimum support ascends. Figure 1 (B) shows the runtimes with limit the length of patterns and without limit the length of patterns as the
minimum all-confidence ascends with a fixed minimum support 1%. When the length
of patterns produced exceeds 5, almost all frequent associated patterns are correlated
patterns because of the upward closure property of correlated patterns. Therefore, we
put a limit to the maximal length of patterns generated. Figure 1 indicates that if the
maximum length of patterns produced does not exceed 5, the runtime decreases
sharply even if the minimum support or the minimum all-confidence is low.

Fig. 1. The runtime of mushroom dataset

Table 3 shows the number of associated-correlated patterns and associated but not
correlated patterns generated in mushroom dataset when the minimum all-confidence
increases with the fixed minimum support 1%, minimum corr-confidence 1%,
minimum pattern length 2 and maximum pattern length 5. From Table 3, we can see
that for the minimum corr-confidence 1% and the minimum all-confidence 90%, there
are seven associated but not correlated patterns and eight associated-correlated
patterns in mushroom dataset. We can conclude that not all associated patterns are
correlated even if the minimum all-confidence is much high. Table 4 and Table 5
show the number of associated-correlated patterns and associated but not correlated
patterns generated in TCM dataset and mushroom dataset respectively as the

minimum corr-confidence varies. To our surprise, when the minimum corr-confidence
is 5%, there are only 0.28% associated but not correlated patterns of all associated
patterns in TCM dataset, while there are 16% associated but not correlated patterns of
all associated patterns in mushroom dataset.

4 Conclusions
The mining combined association with correlation can discover both associated and
correlated patterns that are extraordinary useful for making business decisions. In this
paper, a new interestingness measure for correlation mining is proposed, which is not
only suitable for mining long correlated patterns, but also more rational and easier to
control than the chi-squared test and other commonly used measures as shown in
experimental results. And an algorithm is developed for efficiently discovering all
frequent both associated and correlated patterns. Experimental results show that the
techniques developed in this paper are feasible.
