Abstract. In this paper we develop a new approach within the framework of asset pricing models that incorporates two key features of the
latent volatility: co-movement among conditionally heteroskedastic ﬁnancial returns and switching between diﬀerent unobservable regimes.
By combining conditionally heteroskedastic factor models with hidden
Markov chain models (HMM), we derive a dynamical local model for
segmentation and prediction of multivariate conditionally heteroskedastic ﬁnancial time series. The EM algorithm that we have developed for
the maximum likelihood estimation, is based on a Viterbi approximation which yields inferences about the unobservable path of the common
factors, their variances and the latent variable of the state process. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and preliminary experiments obtained
with a dataset on weekly average returns of closing spot prices for eight
European currencies show promising results.

Introduction

The factor Model, also called Index Model, is one of the basic models in ﬁnance
to analyze and describe the return generation process and the risk/reward relationships of a large number of assets. It has been used extensively in ﬁnance for
measuring co-movement in and forecasting ﬁnancial time series. Traditionally,
these issues were considered in a static framework, but recently, the emphasis
has shifted toward inter-temporal asset pricing models in which agents decisions
are based on the distribution of returns conditional on the available information,
which is obviously changing. Several researchers have used Factor-ARCH models
to provide a plausible and parsimonious parameterization of the time varying
covariance structure of asset returns. Engle et al. [1] apply such structures to
study the dynamic behavior of the term structure of interest rates. Diebold and
Nerlove [2] use a latent factor ARCH model to describe the dynamics of exchange

rate volatility. Engle and Susmel [3] use the factor ARCH to test for common
volatility in international equity markets.
A natural generalization of the diﬀerent models proposed in the above literature to a multi-state model can be achieved by allowing for model transitions
that are governed by a Markov chain on a set of possible models describing the
diﬀerent states of volatility. The originality of this work is the use of a piece-wise
multivariate and linear process – which we also regard as a mixed-state dynamic
linear system – for modeling the regime switches. In particular, we suppose that
the observed series can be approximated using a time varying parameter model
with the assumption that the evolution of these parameters is governed by a
ﬁrst-order hidden Markov process with m states.

Basic Model and Factor Structure

The model that we propose supposes that excess returns depend both on unobservable factors that are common across the multivariate time series, and on
unobservable diﬀerent regimes that describe the diﬀerent states of volatility. In
this framework, we allow a dynamic structure for the conditional variances of the
underlying factors in order to investigate possible time-varying latent processes,
and their implications in modeling changes in covariance matrices over time.
This new speciﬁcation is deﬁned by:
St ∼ P (St = j/St−1 = i)
t = 1, ..., n and i, j = 1, ..., m
fst = Hst ft∗
1/2

where

ft∗ ∼ N (0, Ik )

yt = Xst fst + εst with εst ∼ N (θst , Ψst )
where St ∼ P (St = j/St−1 = i) is a hidden Markov chain indicating the state
or the regime at the date t, and yt is a q × 1 random vector of observable
variables (ﬁnancial returns). In an unspeciﬁed state St = j (j = 1, ..., m), θj
are the q × 1 mean vectors, fjt the k × 1 vectors of unobserved common factors, εjt the q × 1 vectors of idiosyncratic noises, Xj the q × k factor loadings matrices, with q ≥ k and rank(Xj ) = k, Ψj are q × q diagonal and
deﬁnite positive matrices of idiosyncratic variances, and Hjt the k × k diagonal and deﬁnite positive matrices whose elements are the variances of the
common factors presumedly time varying and their parameters changes according to the regime. In particular, we suppose that the variances of the common factors follow switching GQARCH(1,1) processes, the l-th diagonal element of the matrix Hjt under an unspeciﬁed regime St = j since St−1 = i being

Viterbi Approximation for Latent Structure Inference

The model developed above can be regarded as a random ﬁeld with indices
i = 1, ..., q, t = 1, ..., n and j = 1, ..., m. Therefore, it has a switching state-space
representation, with ft as the continuous state variables. The measurement and
transition equations are, respectively, given by:
yt = θst + Xst fst + εst
fst = 0.fst−1 + fst
The task of Viterbi approximation approach is to ﬁnd the best sequence of
switching states St and common factors ft that minimizes the Hamiltonian cost
in equation (1) for a given observation sequence Y1:n .

Deﬁne ﬁrst the ”best” partial cost up to time t of the measurement sequence
Y1:t when the switch is in state j at time t:

min H F1:t , {S1:t−1 , St = j}, Y1:t

S1:t−1 ,Ft

Namely, this cost is the least cost over all possible sequences of switching
states S1:t−1 and corresponding factor model states F1:t . In order to calculate
this cost we ﬁrst start by introducing some notation.

Given a new observation yt at time t each of these predicted estimates can now
be ﬁltered using Kalman measurement update framework:

one portion of this innovation cost reﬂects the continuous state transition, as
indicated by the innovation terms in equation (5). The remaining cost (− log pij )
is due to switching from state i to state j.
Obviously, for every current switching state j there are m possible previous
switching states from which the system could have originated from. To minimize
the overall cost at every time step t and for every switching state j, one ”best”
previous state i is selected:
Jt,j = min{Jt,t−1,i,j + Jt−1,i }
i

δt−1,j = arg min{Jt,t−1,i,j + Jt−1,i }

(8)

i

the index of this state is kept in the state transition record δt−1,j . Consequently,
we now obtain a set of m best ﬁltered continuous states and their variances at
δt−1,j (j)
δt−1,j (j)
δt−1,j (j)
j
= ft/t
and Hjt/t = Ht/t
with hjlt/t−1 = hlt/t−1
. Once
time t: ft/t
all n observations Y1:n have been fused, the best overall cost is obtained as
Jn∗ = min Jn,j . To decode the ”best” switching state sequence, one uses the
j

index of the best ﬁnal state, jn∗ = arg min Jn,j , then traces back through δt−1,j :

jt∗ = δt,jt+1
.
The Switching model’s suﬃcient statistics are now simply given by E(St /.) =
St (j ∗ ) and E(St St−1 /.) = St (j ∗ )St−1 (j ∗ ) . 1 Given the ”best” switching state
sequence, the suﬃcient factor model statistics can be easily obtained using the
Rauch-Tung-Streiber smoothing (Rosti A-V.I and Gales M.J.F [4]). For example,

if j = jt∗ and 0 otherwise.
E(ft , St (j)/.) = ft/n

Experimental Results

In this section, we study the performance of our proposed algorithm using synthetic and ﬁnancial data.
5.1

Model Learning and Stability of the Estimates

The example used here has q = 6 series, m = 3 hidden states and only one
common factor. The regime switching dates are t∗1 = n/3 + 1 and t∗2 = 2n/3 +
1. The iterations of the EM algorithm2 stop when the relative change in the
likelihood function between two subsequent iterations is smaller than a threshold
value = 10−4 . In this experiment we try to estimate the parameters of the
model and to study the behavior of the estimates when the size of the sequence
n increases. A natural metric to measure the distance of estimators from the
true parameters is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (Juang and Rabiner [5]). For
each value of n, the estimation procedure was carried out a hundred times,
and the distances Kn (Θ0 , Θn ) between each of the hundred estimators and the
true parameter Θ0 were evaluated on a new sequence, independent of the ﬁrst
hundred sequences used to obtain the estimators. Figure 1 clearly shows a general
decrease in average and spread of the distances with increasing n. This imply an
increasing accuracy and stability of the estimators as n increases.
5.2

Model Selection Procedure

Comparing the adequacy of diﬀerent models may be done by computing a criterion for each model and comparing the criteria values. In this experiment BIC
2

The initial parameters for the EM algorithm, were obtained by randomly perturbing
the true parameter values by up to 20% of their true value.

and ICL criteria are used. The ICL criterion, is based on the maximization of
the integrated complete log-likelihood function (Biernacki and Celeux [6]). Here
we consider two diﬀerent heteroskedastic speciﬁcations. For the two examples,
q = 6 and n = 900 was used. In the ﬁrst case the true model is the one used in
5.1. In the second case, we take m = k = 2 and t∗ = n/2 + 1.
The steps for the model selection procedure are as follows. For each selection criterion, ﬁrst, train various model conﬁgurations (obtained by varying the
number of states and the number of factors). Second, use the output of EM to
compute the values of the selection criterion for all conﬁgurations and select the
one that yields the lowest value. In the two examples, random initialisation was
used for the implementation of the learning algorithm. With this intention, we
generated 100 diﬀerent data experiments according to the true model. In the
ﬁrst case the results show that BIC and ICL chose 3 states and one factor most
of the time (68%, 73%). This is the best classiﬁcation, since the use of one or
two states is not enough to represent the data, and choosing two factors corresponds to an overﬁtting. In the second case, BIC and ICL choose also the true
speciﬁcation most of the time (79%, 81%).
5.3

Financial Data

We have applied our model also to learn and analyze the co-movements amongst
several exchange rate returns during the period where the European exchange
rate mechanism has experienced a succession of crisis which reached its ﬁrst
culmination at the end of August 1992. What has been the impact of these
changes on the nature of volatility? Has the degree of co-movement increased
or decreased? Have common ﬂuctuations become more or less volatile? Has the
impact of crises on individual countries evolved over time? These questions are of
interest to both policy makers and academic economists. For example, the questions of whether the common volatility has increased or declined, and whether
countries have become more or less symmetric, are central to monetary and ﬁscal
policy issues.
The time series considered here are the weekly average returns of closing
spot prices relative to the US Dollar of the FRF, CHF, ITL, DEM, BEF, ESP,
SEK, and GBP from 07/17/1985 to 01/22/1997 (600 observations). We trained

various model conﬁgurations (obtained also by varying the number of states and
the number of factors). The key point for initialization consists in implementing
a standard EM algorithm by supposing that the factors are homoskedastic 3 .
Thereafter and given the output of the EM algorithm, we can use the values of
St (j) in order to obtain the optimal sequence of hidden states. At the second
step, a particular simple conditionally heteroskedastic factor model is initialized
for each segment. For this, one can use the empirical covariance matrices as
estimates of the idiosyncratic variance matrices Ψj and the empirical means as
estimates of the means θj . The parameters of the conditionally heteroskedastic
variances are initialized by applying a GQARCH(1,1) model to each segment
of data. Finally, the elements of the transition matrix P, can be initialized by
counting the number of transitions from state i to state j and dividing by the
number of transitions from state i to any other state.
All the selection criteria argue that the time varying covariance structure
could be modeled by two conditionally heteroskedastic common factors and three
markovian regimes. For example in the cas of French Franc, ﬁgure 2 shows how
the model is capable of accurately detecting abrupt changes in the time series
structure and, in particular, the severe disruption by the violent storm which hit
the European currency markets in September and October 1992. This segmentation shows that the third model is responsible for the high volatility segments,
the second model is mainly responsible for the time period before September
1992, and the ﬁrst for the lower volatility segments after 1993. This ﬁgure shows
also that the average duration stay in the ﬁrst regime is about 31.88 months
versus 89.38 in the second and 28.73 in the third. For the two common factors,
estimated αi and δi are both statistically signiﬁcant and their sum is slightly less
than one which indicates strong GARCH eﬀects and persistence in the volatility
of exchange rates. The results show also that all the correlations between the

diﬀerent currencies have declined just after August 1992. This is not surprising
because at the end of 1992 the range of the Exchange Rate Mechanism expanded
to 30%, which practically meant a return to free ﬂuctuation.

Conclusion

The paper has developed a novel solution to the problem of modeling conditionally heteroskedastic ﬁnancial time series subject to Markov switching within
a multivariate framework. This new speciﬁcation takes into account, simultaneously, the usual changing behavior of the common volatility due to common
economic forces, as well as the sudden discrete shift in common and idiosyncratic
volatilities that can be due to sudden abnormal events.
One of the most interesting applications of this new dynamic speciﬁcation
in ﬁnance is the possibility of obtaining on-line predictions of the time varying
covariance matrices that is useful for dynamic asset allocation, active portfolio
management and the analysis of options prices. The analysis in this paper can
be also extended in several ways. First, our model can be generalized to one
where one allows the idiosyncratic variances to be a stochastic function of time.
Secondly, we can also think of the case where the state transition probabilities
are not homogeneous in time, but depend on the previous state and the previously observed covariates levels. The study of such models would provide more
ﬂexibility in ﬁnancial applications.
