Abstract. Spherical Harmonic Transforms (SHTs) which are essentially Fourier
transforms on the sphere are critical in global geopotential and related
applications. For analysis purposes, discrete SHTs are difficult to formulate for
an optimal discretization of the sphere, especially for applications with
requirements in terms of near-isometric grids and special considerations in the
polar regions. With the enormous global datasets becoming available from
satellite systems, very high degrees and orders are required and the implied
computational efforts are very challenging. Among the best known strategies
for discrete SHTs are quadratures and least squares. The computational aspects
of SHTs and their inverses using both quadrature and least-squares estimation
methods are discussed with special emphasis on information conservation and
numerical stability. Parallel and grid computations are imperative for a number
of geodetic, geophysical and related applications, and these are currently under
investigation.

1 Introduction
Domains with spherical topology are very common in astronomy, cosmology,
geophysics, geodesy and related disciplines. On the spherical Earth as on the celestial
sphere, computations can be done for regional and global domains using planar and
spherical formulations. Spherical quadratures and least-squares estimation are used to
convert continuous integral formulations into summations over data lattices. Spherical
topologies are quite different from planar ones and these have important implications
in the computational aspects of data processing.
Spherical geocomputations for regional domains of even continental extents can be
reduced to planar computations and under assumptions of stationarity or shift
invariance, discrete regular array computations can be optimized using Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs). Specifically, convolution operations for filtering and other data
processing applications thereby require only O(NlogN) instead of O(N2) operations
for N data in one dimension, O(N2logN) instead of O(N4) operations for NxN data in
two dimensions, and so on.
For global appplications, Gaussian, equiangular and other similar rectangular grids
can be used for spherical quadratures and discrete convolutions. Various quadrature

strategies are available in the literature going back to Gauss and Neumann, in addition
to least-squares estimation techniques (e.g. [14]). Other approaches have also been used
for discretization and analysis of functions on the sphere using icosahedral, triangular
and curvilinear tesselations. Depending on the applications, these strategies may be
preferable to the rectangular ones which will be discussed in the following.

2 Continuous and Discrete SHTs
The orthogonal or Fourier expansion of a function f(θ, λ) on the sphere S2 is given by
∞

f (θ, λ) = ∑

∑

f n ,m Ynm (θ, λ)

n = 0 |m|≤ n

(1)

using colatitude θ and longitude λ, where the basis functions Ynm (θ, λ ) are called the
spherical harmonics satisfying the (spherical) Laplace equation ΔS2 Ynm (θ, λ) = 0 , for
all |m| < n and n = 0, 1, 2, …. This is an orthogonal decomposition in the Hilbert
space L2 (S 2 ) of functions square integrable with respect to the standard rotation
invariant measure dσ = sin θ dθ dλ on S2. In particular, the Fourier or spherical
harmonic coefficients appearing in the preceding expansion are obtained as inner
products
f n ,m = ∫ f (θ, λ) Ynm (θ, λ) dσ

(2)

S2

with the overbar denoting the complex conjugate. In most practical applications, the
functions f(θ,λ) are band-limited in the sense that only a finite number of those
coefficients are nonzero, i.e. f n,m ≡ 0 for all n > N and orders |m| < n. Hence, using
the regular grid θj = jπ/2N and λk = kπ/N,
synthesis can be formulated as
N −1

f (θ j , λ k ) = ∑

∑

n = 0 |m|≤ n

j,k = 0,…,2N-1, spherical harmonic

f n,m Ynm (θ j , λ k )

(3)

and using some appropriate spherical quadrature, the corresponding spherical
harmonic analysis can be formulated as
f n ,m =

2 N −1 2N −1

∑ ∑

k =0

q j f (θ j , λ k ) Ynm (θ j , λ k )

for quadrature weights qj as discussed by various authors e.g. [2], [3], [4] and [6].

and geodetic normalization is slightly different from the usual mathematical

Explicitly, using the geodetic formulation and convention, one has for synthesis,

with the preceding quadrature weights qj. Notice that in practice, depending on
conventions, DFT and IDFT could be interchanged in the preceding derivation and for
computational efficiency, direct and inverse FFTs would be substituted.
The preceding derivation can easily be modified for data grids with Δθ = Δλ such
as
{(qj, lk) | qj = jp/2N, lk = kp/2N; j = 0, 1, …, 2N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 4N-1}
with the possible exclusion of the poles as
{(qj, lk) | qj = (j+1/2)p/2N, lk = kp/2N; j = 0, 1, …, 2N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 4N-1}
which also permit the use of hemispherical symmetries in the associated Legendre
functions
Pnm(cos (π – θ)) = (-1)n+m Pnm(cos θ) .
(16)
More details can be found in [4]. Notice that these data grids have 2Nx4N or 8N2
quantities for N2 spectral coefficients for band limitedness N.

3 Spectral Analysis Using Least Squares
Let us consider the regular data grid
{(qj, lk) | qj = jp/N, lk = kp/2N; j = 0, 1, …, N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 2N-1}
or with the exclusion of the poles,
{(qj, lk) | qj = (j+1/2)p/N, lk = kp/2N; j = 0, 1, …, N-1, k = 0, 1, …, 2N-1}
which implies Δθ = Δλ. This is the grid normally considered in geodesy to model the
geopotential field with least data for a spectral expansion to degree and order N – 1.
From the preceding discussion, one can write
N −1

&&& (cos θ )]
f (θ j , λ k ) = Re IDFTk [ ∑ (a nm + ib nm )P

(17)

n=m

for the unknown anm and bnm. Hence
DFTk [f (θ j , λ k ) + i0] =

N −1

∑ (a

n =m

nm

&&& (cos θ )
+ ib nm )P

(18)

which implies that for each m = 0, 1, …, N-1, least squares can be used to estimate
the spectral coefficients amm, am+1,m, …, aN-1,m and bmm, bm+1,m, …, bN-1,m.
It is very important to notice that a maximum degree of N – 1 is critical for the
least-squares solution for the spectral coefficients amm, am+1,m, …, aN-1,m and bmm,
bm+1,m, …, bN-1,m using N partitions in latitude, i.e. qj = jp/N, or qj = (j+1/2)p/N, j =

0, 1, …, N- 1. In other words, the use of N parallels for degree N would lead to an
underdetermined system for amm, am+1,m, …, aN,m and bmm, bm+1,m, …, bN,m, as
apparently suggested in [14].
In most practical implementations, the partition in latitude is shifted by half a grid
interval to avoid any numerical complication at the pole for θ = 0. Furthermore, the
partition in latitude is not required to be equispaced for the least-squares estimation of
the spectral coefficients. However, in longitude, equispacing is required for the usual
implementation of the DFTs as FFTs.

4 Numerical Experimentation
As indicated earlier, there are several formulations for employing spherical harmonics
as an analysis tool. One popular code that is readily available is Spherepack [1] of
which a new version has been released recently. Other experimental codes are those
of Driscoll and Healy [6] and the follow-ons, such as [7] and [12], plus the example
algorithm described by Mohlenkamp [9][10] and offered as a partial sample
implementation in [11]. Experimentation with these codes has shown scaling
differences from that which is expected in a geodetic context [13].
Using the Driscoll and Healy [6] formulation modified as described in Section 2,
extensive experimentation using different grids on several computer platforms in
double precision (i.e. REAL*8) and quadruple precision (i.e. REAL*16) has been
carried out. However, only double precision results are reported in this paper. The
first synthesis started with unit coefficients, anm = bnm = 1, except for bn0 = 0, for all
degrees n and orders m, which corresponds to white noise. Then, following analysis
of the generated spatial grid values, the coefficients are recomputed and root-meansquare (RMS) values are given for this synthesis/analysis. Then after another
synthesis using these recomputed coefficients, RMS values of recomputed grid
residuals are given for the second synthesis. Hence, starting with arbitrary coefficients
{cnm}, the procedure can be summarized as follows:
SHT[SHT-1[{cnm}]] - [{cnm}]
synthesis/analysis,

→

RMS

of

first

and
SHT-1[SHT[SHT-1[{cnm}]]] - SHT-1[{cnm}] →

RMS of second synthesis.

Notice that the first RMS is in the spectral domain while the second is in the spatial
domain. The SHTs and SHT-1s are evaluated and re-evaluated explicitly to study their
numerical stability and the computational efficiency. Table 1(top) lists the RMS
values and the computation times with grids Δθ = ½Δλ (i.e., 2Nx2N) and Δθ = Δλ
(i.e., Nx2N and 2Nx4N). The above procedure is repeated for coefficients
corresponding to 1/degree2, i.e. explicitly, anm = 1/(n+1)2, bnm = 0 for m=0, and
1/(n+1)2, otherwise, for all degrees n and orders m, which simulate a physically
realizable situation. The corresponding RMS values and computation times for
various grids are listed in the bottom part of Table 1. It should be noted that the
results for the grid Nx2N are based on least squares whereas for 2Nx2N and 2Nx4N
the quadrature scheme discussed in Section 2 is used, and the computations were done
on an AMD 64 Athlon FX-51 PC in REAL*8 precision.

The RMS of errors involved in the least squares (Nx2N) and quadratures (2Nx2N
and 2Nx4N) schemes are comparable (Table 1) and varying in the range 10-12 to 10-15
for unit coefficients and 10-15 to 10-17 for 1/degree2 coefficients. The computation
times for both the approaches, however, vary significantly. Preliminary investigations
indicate inefficiency in the least-squares approach resulting in extra efforts needed in
the normal equations corresponding to each order m to estimate the related spectral
coefficients. Work is in progress to optimize this part of the code to make the
computation times comparable to the quadrature scheme.
Spectral analysis of the synthesis/analysis results can be done degree by degree to study
the characteristics of the estimated spectral harmonic coefficients. The results of the
second synthesis also enable a study of the spatial results parallel by parallel, especially for
the polar regions. Such investigations are currently underway to better characterize the
numerical stability and reliability of the SHT and SHT-1. Ongoing experimentation is
attempting to carry out the computations to higher degrees and orders.

5 Concluding Remarks
Considerable work has been done on solving the computational complexities, and
enhancing the speed of calculation of spherical harmonics transforms for different
equiangular grids. The approach of Driscoll and Healy [6] is exact for exact arithmetic,
and with a number of modifications, different implementations have been experimented
with, leading to RMS errors of orders 10-12 to 10-15 with unit coefficients of degrees and
orders up to 1500. Comparable RMS have been obtained with the least-squares
estimation approach. However the computational efforts with least squares are quite
significantly larger than with the quadrature approach. When starting with spherical
harmonic coefficients corresponding to 1/degree2, the previously mentioned analysis and
synthesis results are improved to 10-15-10-18 with both approaches. The latter simulations
are perhaps more indicative of the expected numerical accuracies in practice.
All these computational experiments started with unit and 1/degree2 coefficients of
degrees 0, 1, 2, …, N-1 for spherical N x 2N grids with least squares, and 2N x 2N
and 2N x 4N grids with quadratures, offset in latitude by half a grid unit from the
pole. It remains to be seen how these spatial lattices differ for the same spectrum of
degree and order N – 1 for a specified N. This comparative spatial analysis is
currently underway.
Computations for higher degrees and orders are under consideration assuming the
availability of parallel FFT code in quadruple precision. As enormous quantities of
data are involved the intended gravity field applications, parallel and grid
computations are imperative for these applications. Preliminary experimentation with
parallel processing has already been done [15].
