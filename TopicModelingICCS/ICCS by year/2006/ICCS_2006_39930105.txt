Abstract. Numerical prediction of the physical properties of nanocomposites is an attractive area that requires more discussion and investigation.
In this paper, we calculate the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites
embedded with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based on the representative
volume element (RVE) concept. The RVE, which encompasses a single
CNT, was constructed assuming that the CNTs are distributed in polymeric material homogeneously, and also assuming that the CNTs have no
interaction with other CNTs. This research describes the thermal characteristics of nanoscale materials - CNTs ﬁlled nanocomposites - as a case
study and measured their thermal conductivity, for the purpose of validation of numerical results. The dispersion state of the CNTs was observed
using ﬁeld emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM). We found
that the numerically predicted thermal conductivity is closely matches the
experimental one and that the numerical tool employed in the study is
superior to other analytical and numerical methods.

Introduction

Polymeric nanocomposites ﬁlled with nanoscale particles such as clay, nanoﬁber,
and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been vigorously investigated over the past
decade and remarkable achievements have been reported [1]. It was recently reported that CNT nanocomposites possess excellent thermal conductivities which
can be applied to production of miniature devices managing heat transfer. In this
paper, we focus on the thermal characteristics of the CNT ﬁlled polymeric composites but not thermal conductivity of the CNT itself. Most studies on thermal
conductivity of CNT nanocomposites have been carried out experimentally or
analytically [2]. To consider the contribution of various determinants like CNT
geometry or concentration on the thermal conductivity, numerical analysis and
calculation is required. In the current study, the eﬀective thermal conductivity
tensor of CNT ﬁlled composites is discussed using a homogenization method. In

particular, the inﬂuence of the aspect ratio and the content of CNTs are investigated. In contrast to most of the previous studies on the homogenization method
using the FEM, control volume ﬁnite element method (CVFEM) is employed in
the implementation of the homogenization method. The bounding approach is
also adopted to take the orientation state of the CNTs into account and the analytic model [3] is used in the comparison with numerical results. The predicted
thermal conductivities of nanoscale materials are compared with experimental
results.

Computation Method

The AEH method is superior in several ways to other analytic and numerical
methods. The contribution of complex geometries and anisotropic material properties of ﬁllers can be precisely calculated through the AEH method as well as
both localization and homogenization for heterogeneous materials. In the current
study, two diﬀerent packing structure of the CNTs, square and hexagonal packing, are taken into account so as to evaluate the contribution of CNT packing
conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), respectively.

RVE in CNT ﬁlled nanocomposites

The periodic unit cell consists of three diﬀerent regions, i.e., matrix, CNT,
and air which are denoted by Ωm , Ωc , and Ωa , respectively. Each region has
its own thermal conductivity. This study assume the following: (i) CNTs are
homogeneously dispersed in the CNT/polymer composites and have uniform dimensions including their length, inner, and outer diameters. (ii) there is no direct
interaction between the adjacent CNTs. (iii) the CNT composites contain the
periodic unit cell which includes a single CNT embedded unidirectionally. The
1, is deﬁned as the ratio of the characteristic length
scale parameter, ε = Ll
scales, which implies that the entire dimension, Ω, of RVE is negligible compared
to the characteristic length, L, for all of the composites. The temperature ﬁeld
is asymptotically expanded as below.
T (xi , yi ) = T (0) (xi , yi ) + εT (1) (xi , yi ) + ε2 T (2) (xi , yi ) + ...

where xi and yi indicate the global and local length scales. The asymptotic
expansion homogenization method (AEH) adopts two distinct coordinate systems, i.e., macroscopic scale xi and microscopic scale yi , which can describe the

macroscopic and microscopic behaviors of CNT ﬁlled composites. It is assumed
that the temperature ﬁeld is periodic with respect to yi coordinate system. The
global coordinate system and the local coordinate system have the relation of
yi = xεi . The diﬀerential operator is written as the following.

Numerical Implementation

The control volume ﬁnite element method (CVFEM), which is known as a very
eﬃcient numerical method for heat transfer problems is employed as numerical
implementation method in this study. Equations (13)-(15) are rewritten in the
general form as below.
∂Ji

(16)

The diﬀusion ﬂux and the source term for the other regions are obtained in
ways similar to the above equations. Because CVFEM is based on the conservation principle within the control volume, we integrate equation (17) over the
control volume as the following equation.
∂V

Ji ni ds =

∂V

SdV

(17)

where ∂V is the surface of control volume, and ni is the outward unit vector
normal to a diﬀerential area, ds . In order to integrate equation (20), speciﬁcation of the interpolation function for the dependent variable, χ , is needed in
each element. The linear interpolation function is employed for the characteristic function in the current study. Substitution of the interpolation function into
equation (20) yields the complete set of discretization equations. More details
on the numerical analysis procedure were presented in the previous study.
The unit cells with unidirectionally aligned CNTs have transversely isotropic
physical properties, but the CNTs are dispersed randomly in the composites.
Therefore, the eﬀective thermal conductivity for a composite ﬁlled with randomly dispersed CNTs is obtained from an orientation averaging procedure.
In order to describe the orientation state of CNTs, the second order orientation
tensoris adopted. In addition, to validate the numerically predicted thermal conductivities, they are compared with the results obtained by the analytic model
proposed by Lewis and Nielsen [3]. This model can explain the eﬀect of the shape
and the packing type of the particles for two phase systems. However, it does
not take into account the anisotropy of thermal conductivity for CNTs and the
contribution of air within the CNT.

Measurement

In order to obtain good and homogeneous dispersion of the CNTs in the epoxy
resin, acid treatment on the CNTs was carried out, which also removed impurities
including amorphous carbons, graphite particles, and metal catalysts. The CNTs
were treated in a 3-to-1 mixture of 65% H2SO4/HNO3, under the condition of
100 C for 30 min., after which they were washed with distilled water and then
dried in a vacuum oven. The treated CNTs were then dispersed in a solvent and
mixed with the epoxy resin. After evaporating the solvent, the hardener was
added to the mixture with the CNT loading of 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%. The epoxy and
CNT mixture was cast into a cylindrical cavity and cured in a vacuum oven. The
specimen had a diameter of 10mm and length of 20mm. Therefore, we measured
the thermal conductivity measurement by employing ASTM E1225-87, which
was based on temperature diﬀerence between the reference and the specimen at
steady state and room temperature. For veriﬁcation of uniform dispersion of the
CNTs, morphological characterization was performed by using an FESEM.

Results and Discussion

Fig. 2 presents the increase of thermal conductivity of nanocomposites ﬁlled
with 0.5 wt. % CNTs with respect to the CNT aspect ratio. When the CNTs are
hexagonally arranged in the nanocomposites, the nanocomposites have higher
thermal conductivities. As the aspect ratio of CNTs increases, thermal conductivities of the nanocomposites with hexagonal or square packing of the CNTs,
eventually approaching a limiting value, which can be determined by the rule for
mixture of conductivities for distinct regions. From here, the thermal conductivities predicted numerically mean the values calculated for the square packing of
the CNT.
In Fig. 3, the thermal conductivities calculated by the analytic model and the
homogenization technique are compared in the axial and the parallel directions
of the CNT when the CNT loading is 0.5 wt. % (0.29 % volume fraction). In order
to vary the aspect ratio of CNTs, length of the CNT in the RVE is altered. In the
case of the axial direction of the CNT, both analytic and numerical predictions

Fig. 4. Eﬀective thermal conductivities calculated numerically with respect to CNT

are increased with on increase in the aspect ratio. The thermal conductivity
obtained by the homogenization method increases more rapidly with respect to
the aspect ratio than that obtained the analytic model. When the CNT length
is relatively large, the homogenization method is closer to material properties
averaged by the rule of mixture with the volume fraction. On the other hand, it
is shown in Fig. 3 (b) that thermal conductivities in the parallel direction of the
CNTs have little variation with respect to the aspect ratio of CNT. The eﬀect of
the CNT volume fraction on the thermal conductivity is examined as shown in
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Therefore, Fig. 4 shows that the thermal conductivities of the
nanocomposites in the axial direction are much higher compared to the parallel
direction and that the diﬀerence between them becomes large as the volume
fraction of the CNT increase.
In addition, Fig. 5 (a) presents the eﬀective thermal conductivity of composites ﬁlled with randomly oriented CNTs. The experimental measurement was
carried out for CNT volume fractions of 0.29 and 0.58 %. The numerical and
experimental data for higher volume fraction of CNTs are slightly diﬀerent. The
discrepancy has two causes. First, in the case that the volume fraction is relatively high, it is diﬃcult to reach the homogeneous dispersion without aggregation of the CNTs, as was assumed for this study. Second, the bounding approach
using the orientation tensor cannot completely take into account the contribution of the randomly oriented CNTs. Fig. 5 (b) shows an FESEM image of the
composite ﬁlled with CNTs of 0.5 wt. %. The image indicates that the embedded
CNTs are homogeneously dispersed in the epoxy resin and direct contact between

neighboring CNTs is negligible. This ﬁgure conﬁrms the assumption that there
is no direct interaction between the adjacent CNTs. Although the CNT loading
is too small to reach the electrical percolation, mechanical and rheological properties of CNT ﬁlled composites can be enhanced dramatically [1]. On the other
hand, it has been shown that thermal conductivities do not show the percolation
behavior in contrast to electrical conductivities [6].

Conclusion

The current study shows that the homogenization technique is a promising tool
because it can consider such anisotropic material properties as thermal conductivity, elastic modulus, and thermal expansion coeﬃcient as well as geometrical
complexity. Speciﬁcally speaking, the eﬀective thermal conductivity of the composites ﬁlled with CNTs is evaluated by the homogenization technique. The
control volume ﬁnite element method (CVFEM) is employed so as to implement
the homogenization method. The two diﬀerent RVE structures ﬁlled with a single CNT are adopted in calculation of the thermal conductivity of composites. It
is assumed that the composites have geometric periodicity with respect to local
length scale. Orientation of the CNTs embedded in the composites is taken into
account using the bounding approach. The eﬀect of the aspect ratio and volume
fraction of CNTs on the eﬀective thermal conductivity was investigated. The
numerically calculated conductivities closely match the experimental result.
