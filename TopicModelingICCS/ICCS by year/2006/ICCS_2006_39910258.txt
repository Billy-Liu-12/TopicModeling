Abstract. A semi-Lagrangian scale selective finite difference scheme for
hydrostatic atmospheric model is developed. The principal characteristics of the
scheme are solution of the trajectory equations for advection, explicit first order
approximation of physically insignificant adjustment terms and implicit time
splitting discretization of the principal physical modes. This approach allows
the use of large time steps, keeps practically the second order of accuracy and
requires at each time step the amount of calculations proportional to the number
of spatial grid points. The performed numerical experiments show
computational efficiency of the proposed scheme and accuracy of the predicted
atmospheric fields.

1 Introduction
Atmosphere parameters have a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal variations.
Accordingly, the mathematical models of atmosphere (Euler or Navier-Stokes
equations) contain solutions of different space and time scales. Analysis of the
linearized equations reveals three principal types of atmospheric waves: acoustic,
gravitational and inertial waves. Studying certain physical phenomenon one can try to
filter the secondary effects still keeping all essential characteristics of the principal
part. Analysis of the atmospheric data shows that weather systems are essentially
defined by inertial motions while acoustic waves are practically neglectable. For large
scale atmospheric dynamics the hydrostatic hypothesis is usually applied to filter out
acoustic waves and simplify the governing equations. It has been proved to be
effective simplification producing high quality atmospheric fields at reduced
computational cost. Further attempts of simplification (Boussinesq, barotropic, quasigeostrophic, etc. approximations) have not been succeeded in keeping the same level
of the forecast accuracy.
Although gravity waves seems to be analytically inseparable from inertial ones and
their contribution to weather systems is not neglectable, one can try to divide the
entire spectrum of these waves in more relevant and insignificant parts by using
appropriate numerical methods. This approach can be practically implemented if
vertical decoupling takes place. In fact, expansion of the atmospheric fields by
vertical normal modes reveals high heterogeneity in the distribution of available
energy: few greatest vertical modes are responsible for about ninety percent of total

energy. This way, the general variability can be well predicted if the first vertical
modes are approximated accurately while others are resolved more coarsely.
Moreover, insignificant gravity waves contained in the smallest vertical modes can be
approximated with even lower accuracy.
In this study, a scale separation is applied in the context of semi-Lagrangian semiimplicit (SLSI) method, which is currently the most efficient approach in numerical
weather prediction and atmospheric modeling [8,11,15,16]. In this method the
advective part is represented by equations of the trajectories of fluid particles,
nonlinear terms are approximated explicitly and linear gravity waves implicitly along
the above trajectories. At each time step the implicit terms require solution of 3D
elliptic problem. Vertical decoupling transforms this problem into a set of 2D
Helmholtz equations and eliminates necessity for implicit approximation of the
insignificant vertical modes, but solution of the remaining elliptic problems is still
expensive part of computations [4,7]. To overcome this difficulty, a time splitting
method is applied to factorize each remaining 2D Helmholtz equation in a set of 1D
problems, which are solved very effectively by direct Gelfand-Thomas algorithm. In
order to reduce the splitting errors, which become great when time step exceeds the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition with respect to advection, the modified
splitting proposed by Douglas et al. is applied [6,9,10,17]. This way, joining different
numerical techniques we are able to construct computationally efficient and accurate
SLSI model for the hydrostatic equations of the atmosphere.

2 Primitive Equations
Using time coordinate t , horizontal cartesian coordinates x, y and vertical coordinate

σ = p p s , the governing equations of the hydrostatic atmosphere can be written as
follows [11]:

Here u , v, σ , G, P, T are unknown functions, namely, u and v are the horizontal
velocity components, σ is the vertical velocity component, D = u x + v y is the
horizontal divergence, P = ln p s , p and p s are the pressure and surface pressure
respectively, T is the temperature, G = Φ + RT0 P , Φ = gz is the geopotential, z is

The individual 3D derivative is

, ϕ = u , v, P, T

and the following parameters are used: f is the Coriolis parameter, g is the
gravitational acceleration, R is the gas constant of dry air, c p is the specific heat at
constant pressure. Hereinafter the subscripts t , x, y, σ denote the partial derivatives.

3 Semi-Lagrangian Scale Selective Algorithm
The developed algorithm follows the general outline of the two-time-level SLSI
method [11,15,16] with modifications imposed by application of vertical decoupling
and horizontal splitting. First, the backward in time trajectory equations are solved:
dr
= V , r = (x, y, σ ) , V = (u, v, σ ) , t ∈ [t n , t n +1 ] ; r (t n +1 ) = r a .
dt

(4)

Here r a are given coordinates of the arrival points chosen to be the grid points. One
standard procedure for finding the departure points r (t n ) = r d is solving (4) by the
fixed point iterations [11,15]

Δr (s + 1) = τ V n +1 2 (r (s ) − Δr (s ) 2 ) , Δr (s ) = r a − r (s ) ,

(5)

with velocity defined by the extrapolation formula at the intermediate time level
t n +1 2 = (n + 1 2)τ : V n +1 2 = 3V n − V n −1 2 . Here s is the iteration number and τ is

(

)

the time step. If the iteration convergence condition [14]

τ≤

(

2
, Vd = max u x , u y , uσ , v x , v y , vσ , σ x , σ y , σ σ
3Vd

)

(6)

is satisfied, then trilinear spatial interpolation of the velocity components to the
trajectory points ensures finding the departure points with the second order
of accuracy [13,15,16]. Using the maximum values of the wind component
variations Vd ≈ 1.5 ⋅ 10 −4 s −1 , the maximum allowable time step obtained from (6) is
τ ≈ 70 min .
The second stage consists of semi-Lagrangian forward-backward approximation of
the prognostic equations (1),(3):
uˆ n +1 − u n

Pˆ n+1 − Pn

vˆ n +1 − v n
= fvˆ n +1 − Gˆ xn +1 + N un +1 2 ,

The nonlinear terms are found by extrapolation at the intermediate time level t n +1 2 :

N n +1 2 =

The superscripts n − 1 , n and n + 1 denote the values at the past t n −1 , current t n and
new t n +1 time levels along the trajectory of air particles, that is,

ϕ n+1 = ϕ (t n+1 ,r (t n+1 )) , ϕ n = ϕ(tn ,r (t n )) , ϕ n−1 = ϕ (t n−1 ,r (t n−1 )) , ϕ = u, v, G, P, T , D, σ .
Formulas (7),(8) can be solved in simple explicit way, but they have only the first
order of accuracy and very restrictive CFL condition of stability:

τ ≤ 2h g c g ,

(9)

where h g is a mesh size of spatial grid used for the gravity terms (that is, for the
pressure gradient and divergence) and c g ≈ 350 m s is the maximum velocity of the
gravity waves in the primitive system. On the spatial grid C with the main mesh size
h = 50 km , the minimum gravity mesh size is h g = h 2 = 25km [11]. Then the
maximum allowable time step is about 100 sec , which is very small as compared with
accuracy requirements. If the coarser mesh size of 75km is used for approximation of
the pressure gradient and divergence, then τ ≈ 5 min , which is still small.
The third stage consists of vertical decoupling and formulation of equations for
implicit and more accurate approximation of the principal vertical modes. To this end,
the equations for corrections to preliminary values are considered:

δ v − δ vˆ δ G x − δ Gˆ x δ v

Here δ ϕˆ = ϕˆ n +1 − ϕ n , and unknown functions found by the formulas

ϕ n +1 = ϕˆ n +1 + δϕ , ϕ = u, v, G , P, T , D, σ
coincide with solution of usual two-time-level SLSI scheme described in [12,16].
To avoid unnecessary corrections for insignificant vertical modes, the last system
is vertically decoupled using the eigenvectors of the vertical structure matrix. To
obtain these eigenvectors, the last two equations are simplified to the form

Equations (10), (12) form the closed system for three unknown functions. After
vertical discretization on the Lorenz vertical K level grid [2,3,5], the discrete
analogues of equations (10), (12) can be written as follows:

where u, v, D, G are the vectors of order K and A is K × K matrix of the vertical
structure. The distribution of variables on the Lorenz vertical grid and some natural
approximations to vertical operators can be found in [2,3,5]. Since discretization on
this grid is more straightforward for keeping conservation properties of the primitive
equations it seems to be the most popular vertical grid for hydrostatic models [2,5].
It was proved in [5] that the matrix A has the spectral decomposition A = SΛS −1
with the positive eigenvalue matrix Λ = diag[λ1 , … , λ K ] and the matrix of
eigenvectors (that is, vertical normal modes) S . Of course, all these transformations
and calculations related to finding of the vertical structure matrix and its spectral
decomposition are made only once before numerical forecasting.
Multiplying the equations of system (13) on the left by S −1 , one obtains K

Here k = 1,… , K is the index of vertical mode, c k = RT0 λ k is the gravity wave
speed of the k -th vertical mode and
dϕ = S −1 ⋅ δϕ , dϕˆ = S −1 ⋅ δϕˆ

, ck2 = RT0 λk ,

(15)

that is, dϕ k are the coefficients of expansion of physical corrections δϕ by the
vertical normal modes s k , which compile the matrix S , and analogously for dϕˆ k .
The eigenvalues λ k (and c k ) are supposed to be numbered in decreasing order.
From now on, we omit the subscript k, because it does not cause any ambiguity.
The last step of the algorithm is solution of (14) for the first principal I modes
(other modes remain without change) by applying a time splitting technique. Each
system (14) for i = 1, … , I is splitted into two subsystems solved successively for
auxiliary corrections dϕ~ and final corrections dϕ :

Here h is an additional modification term by Douglas et al. [9,10]. It can be shown
that (16),(17) is the second order approximation to (14) and the splitting error can be
reduced with no penalty on simplicity of algorithm by choosing function h as follows:

Each of the systems (16), (17) is transformed to 1D elliptic problem for Gcorrections and the last is solved by simple Gelfand-Thomas algorithm. Found
corrections are added to the values of the greatest modes and inverse vertical
transformation returns the physical fields composed of the principal modes evaluated
by semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit scheme and secondary modes calculated by
equations (7),(8).
Applied scale separation allows to reduce the amount of computations at each time
step and keep reasonably large time step. The linear stability analysis gives the
approximate stability condition

τ ≤ 2 h g c I +1

(18)

for the explicit modes ( c I +1 is the maximum gravity wave speed of the explicit
modes) and the trajectory convergence restriction (6) for the implicit modes. Since
gravity speeds decrease rapidly as I increases, the explicit treatment of the smallest
vertical modes does not cause strict limitation on the time step.

4 Numerical Tests
The described scheme was applied to 20-level hydrostatic model on horizontal grid
with mesh size h = 50km . The first seven vertical modes with gravity wave speeds
c1 = 343 m s , c 2 = 203 m s , c3 = 122 m s , c 4 = 78.1 m s , c5 = 54.3 m s ,
c 6 = 40.9 m s , c 7 = 32.6 m s were corrected and the remaining modes were treated
explicitly with mesh size h g = 75km for the gravity wave terms. The greatest gravity
speed of the explicit modes is c8 = c I +1 = 25.5 m s so that condition (18) allows to
use time steps up to 60min, which is approximately equal to requirement (6) for the
trajectory iterations. This way, the maximum time steps for traditional SLSI scheme
(SLSIT) and described scale selective SLSI scheme (SLSIS) are practically coincide.
For evaluation of accuracy and computational efficiency of SLSIS scheme, its
performance was compared with SLSIT scheme and with Eulerian leapfrog scheme

(LF). The last is a simple rather popular explicit scheme tested in different models of
the atmosphere. The integrations were carried out on horizontal domain of
5000x5000 km 2 centered at Porto Alegre city ( 30 0 S , 52 0 W ) and the initial and
boundary conditions were obtained from objective analysis and global forecasts of the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

The 24-h forecasts were computed by using each of the above three schemes. The
computational cost of one SLSIT forecast is about 18% of the LF computational time
and the SLSIS scheme computation is about 42% faster than the SLSIT scheme. The
root-mean-square differences between 24-h forecast and NCEP analysis are shown in
Figs.1,2 for two elements: geopotential height at the 500hPa pressure level and
temperature at the 850hPa pressure level. These characteristic elements are
traditionally verified in the numerical weather prediction systems: the first reflects the
dynamics of the middle atmosphere and the second is important for determination of
humidity and cloud processes [1].
Another important skill measure for short-range forecasting is the correlation
coefficient between predicted and observed tendency [1]. Evaluated for 12-h, 24-h
and 36-h forecasts, this measure shows that the SLSIS and SLSIT forecasts are
virtually coincide and the LF scheme has slightly lower accuracy, that is, it reveals
relation between forecasts similar to that shown in Figs.1,2. Thus, performed
evaluations confirm the validity of the applied method of scale separation and
efficiency of the developed scheme.
