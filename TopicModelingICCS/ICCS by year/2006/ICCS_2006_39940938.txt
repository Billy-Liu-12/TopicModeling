Abstract. Due to high frequent wear and tear or other faults in use, it is important to implement a fault-tolerant communicating network for e-textiles that can
be easily woven into a fabric. In this paper, we introduce token buses to connect
the nodes, instead of the single rings in the original e-textile token grid. The topology of the new network is described. And we also discuss the media access
control protocols and the reliable operations. Simulation results show that the
new e-textile communication network can improve the ability of e-textile applications to tolerate faults and provide the communicating services of less delay.

1 Introduction
Electronic textiles (e-textiles), also called smart fabrics, are emerging new computing
substrates, which combine the advantages and abilities of electronic modules and
textiles into one [1]. People in this research field wear off-the-shelf electrical components such as microprocessors, sensors and conductive strands into traditional clothing materials. Potential applications for e-textiles include medical monitoring, military uniforms and ambient computing devices [2]. And several prototypes based on etextiles are presented in the papers and websites available [1, 3-5].
When the fabrics are tailored as a wearable garment or when the applications are in
use, tear and wear are highly frequent, which potentially introduce link or node failures into the communication network. The failures will lead to the destruction of a
local part in the communication network and even the collapse of the whole distributed system. Consequently, it is important to implement a fault-tolerant communicating network for e-textiles that can be easily woven into fabrics. The physical layout of
the communication network should be run in one of two perpendicular directions,
which is determined by the weaving process. Z. Nakad et al. modify the Token Grid
Network (as shown in Fig. 1(a)) of [6] and propose the e-textile token grid that has an
added “transverse” dimension between two token grids [7].
With the added “transverse” dimension, the e-textile token grid has the capacity to
support large numbers of nodes, thus not limited by the width direction of the fabric
size. By interconnecting the nodes in different grids, the added dimension can decrease the number of the nodes in a ring and directly reduce the delay time to wait for
the tokens. Accounting for the demand of routing around the dormant or disabled
nodes, as shown in Fig. 1, communication protocols implement the “Wrong Routing”
technology [8].

to route the data packet between the nodes on this Row ring with a link fault.

The e-textile token grid provides a communicating scheme with considerable faulttolerant ability for e-textiles in dynamic and harsh environments. However, Z. Nakad’s e-textile token grid network can not tolerate faults simultaneously present on
every ring. The e-textile token grid network offers the fault-tolerant operations for the
communication services, but the distributed system still breaks down in the presence
of the simultaneous faults in every ring (as illustrated in Fig. 2). The reason for this
result lies in the fact that the nodes are interconnected by single rings. A link failure is
sufficient to block off the data traffic on a single ring. And a node fault will stop the
communications on the two perpendicular rings converging on this node, regarded as
two output link faults of the node. For the case (simultaneous faults on every row or
column rings) is potentially high frequent in the manufacturing process or in use, the
communication network for e-textiles should have the ability to recover from the
corrupt state. In this paper, we aim to introduce a token bus to connect the nodes,
instead of the single ring in the original token grid and construct the e-textile grid
network with token bus (EGNTB). With the token bus and its fault-tolerant media
access control protocol, faults can only affect the nodes with errors and have result in
less delay time.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the topology of
the e-textile token grid with specific token bus is illustrated and the operations of the
networks in presence of tears are also discussed. Next, section 3 evaluates the
throughput of the new network in the case of uniform load. Simulation experiments

are also conducted to obtain the time delay of both the EGNTB and the e-textile original token grid with the failures. Finally, we conclude the paper in section 4.

2 e-Textile Grid Network with Token Bus
The e-textiles grid network with token bus (EGNTB) is introduced in this section. The
modification to the topology is discussed. And the fault-tolerant media control access
protocols are introduced in two subsections. The basic operations are described firstly
in subsection 2.1, and then we will discuss the operations on the new network with the
serious faults.
2.1 Topology and Basic Protocols of the EGNTB
The EGNTB (e-textile grid network with token bus) is a two-dimensional network
structure arranged in M rows and N columns. With token buses in row and column,
each node is connected to a row bus and a column bus. Fig. 3(a) depicts an example
of four columns and four rows. The address of every node is denoted as (RowID,
ColumnID). Each token bus is referred by its respective row or column number. For
instance, the top row token bus is named as row-token-bus 1 (RTB1) while the leftmost column token bus is identified as column-token-bus 1 (CTB1). For each node is
connected onto two token buses, two pairs of transmitters and receivers are necessary
to implement the EGNTB. Thanks to the bus topology of the new network, the “transverse” dimension can be easily implemented by connecting the corresponding
row/column token bus of the grids in two perpendicular directions. Additional hardware interfaces are saved.

configuration (c) Node (1, 1) in SR configuration

The specific MAC protocol controls the tokens that are passed from a node to its
active subsequent one on the buses. Different from IEEE 802.4 standard for LAN, the
nodes on a row/column token bus of the EGNTB form a logical token ring without
token competition. As shown in Fig. 3(b), two logical token rings converging on
Node (1, 1) which are named as logical-row-ring1 (LRR1) and logical-column-ring1
(LCR1) respectively. To simplify the description of the network, we assume that all of
the logical row rings have the directions pointing to the right and all of the logical

A Dependable Communication Network for e-Textiles

column rings have the directions pointing to the bottom of the figure. Each node has
the same chance to grasp the token and keep it for sending data packets on the logical
token ring. The basic protocols assign every node has the same period that can be
adapted to the real-life requirements of the applications. As an advantage of the token
rings, except for the usual few bits of station latency, other bits of communicating
buffer are not required in the node of the EGNTB.
The token circulated on every logical ring to keep the information of the network
and control the access chance to the communication channel. Node set on the logical
ring is preserved in the nodes by a bitmap of variable length. The bits can be mapped
to the ID table for routing the packets. Dormant or disabled nodes are considered by
the inactive bits that are encapsulated in the token. Because the EGNTB implement a
logical topology of the original token rings, the basic operation protocol of EGNTB
are similar to the original e-textile token grid networks in [6] and [7]. The basic token
grid operation protocol is described formally in [6]. The nodes in the network have
two configurations: the single-ring connection (SR) and the double-ring (DR) connection (shown in Fig. 3(c) and (b)). For a node with the DR configuration, the row ring
and the column ring converging at this node are separate. While a node is in the
merged configuration, the two rings are merged into a new token ring. If an active
node wants to send a packet to another node on the same row or the same column, the
node should wait for the corresponding ring token and seize it when the token arrives.
And while the destination of the data packet on the different row and column, that is,
in the case of the source node ( R1, C 1) and the destination node ( R 2 , C 2 ) , the operation
protocol will make the node ( R1, C 2 ) or the node ( R 2 , C 1) is in the SR configuration to
connect the source node with the destination one into a ring. For example, if node (4,
1) sends a packet to node (1, 2), the operation protocol can require node (1, 1) or node
(4, 2) be in the SR configuration to form a new merged ring and carry the data packet.
The protocol also supports the inter communication between grids by supporting the
address of the different grid IDs and buffers of appropriate sizes.
2.2 Fault Tolerant Operations
As discussed in the section 1, there are still two potential cases of the faults that can
disable the whole network, though the existing e-textiles networks provide considerable robust operations for applications. By reason of the high frequent abrasions or for
the need of manufacturing e-textile applications, the simultaneous link failures on the
row rings or the column rings often happen. Firstly, a tear across the width of a fabric
will sever the token grid into two parts as shown in Fig. 2(b). Both the parts will only
own the column rings and the full connectivity in every part is lost. The remaining
nodes can not communicate with any node on different columns or rings. Secondly,
the power-efficient characteristics of e-textiles require the power consuming nodes to
enter into a sleep state to conserve power energy. A node in the failure state or in the
dormant state is equivalent to two link failures. That is, a node failure or dormant is
treated as the link failures of its two communication outputs. In the case of every ring
with a node failure or dormant, the communication of original token grid network will
be completely broken out. For the cases discussed above, the existing token grid network for e-textiles needs to enhance its fault-tolerant ability to achieve more robust
operations.

The difference between Z. Nakad’s e-textile token grid network and EGNTB lies in
that each node in latter is connected by logical token rings based on the specific MAC
protocol. The new network benefits from the token bus and the protocol, thus owning
the inherent high reliability. This is the point of how we enhance the fault-tolerant
ability of the EGNTB and make it more suitable for e-textiles applications. The error
detection algorithm with delay-time counters is used for checking the link or node
faults [4] [8]. When a fault is found by the time counters in the nodes, the protocol
update the inactive bits in the token. Both the node fault and the bus fault are detected
and treated as two link failures on the logical token ring. For a node fault, as shown in
Fig. 4(a), the fault is regarded as its input link failure and output link failure in Fig.
4(b). While in the presence of the fault on the token bus, the fault will partition the
node set on the bus into two subsets, which is illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b). Note that
the faults are indicated as red squares in the figure.

When a node faults are checked, the inactive bits in the token are updated to reflect
the dynamic variation on the bus and the failure node is eliminated from the logical
ring. The number of the nodes on the logical token ring decreases by one, as shown in
Fig. 4 (c). The drop in number of the nodes, however, leads to less time delay in transferring the data packet.
In the case of a fault on the token bus, the fault cuts the bus into two parts. Network information including inactive bits and the node set of the logical ring is updated by an error-broadcasting token. The node set of the logical ring is divided into
two subsets by the fault. And for those nodes in the other subset, the associated inactive bits are set up to present that the node is not connected onto the logical ring of the
current subset. Consequently, the former logical ring is partitioned into two logical
token rings without any faults. The result is illustrated in Fig. 5(c).
With the token bus and its specific MAC protocols, the faults introduced in the etextiles only affect the nodes in failure state or the local piece of the bus. When the
simultaneous faults are presented on the every ring as in Fig. 2(a) and (b), local full
connectivity is still preserved. No remaining node will be abrupt by the faults as in the
original token grid network.

3 Network Performance
In this section, the performance of the EGNTB is described. We evaluate the approximate performance of maximum throughput and conduct simulation experiments
to obtain the delay time with several faults.
Given that there is no fault on the network, the EGNTB is an original token grid
network logically. Thus, the maximum capacity of the token grid network that is proposed by T.D. Todd in [10] can be used as the approximate throughput of the
EGNTB. Let τ represent the node-to-node latency, ttoken denote the token transmission time and T is the transmission time of a data packet. R presents the number of
the rows. The approximate throughput of the square EGNTB with uniform load can
be calculated as the following equation [10]:
C =

2 R ( R + 1)
2R + 1

i

1
1 + ttoken / T + τ / T

(1)

.

And to test the network performance with faults, we also conduct simulation experiments by using the physical layer model of the EGNTB on the Matlab. An
EGNTB network of 16 nodes (4 Rows, 4 Columns) is studied on different fault occasions to obtain communication costs. An original e-textile token grid of 16 nodes is
also tested under the same conditions and the results are used for comparison. Node
(1, 1) is selected to send a data packet to every other node in the network. A data
packet transmission comes to an end at the instant when the Node (1, 1) receives a
reply from the destination node. Then a new transmission follows in the same way.
Due to the virtual communicating bus we implement in the Matlab model, the time
cost is recorded as a factor of a time unit. The time unit is defined as the delay that a
token moves from a node to its direct successor on the token ring without any faults.
The cost for transmitting fifteen data packets (fifteen destination node in the grid) is
recorded.

Infinite value

It is noted that single fault of case 2 or 3 or 4 has no effect on the total cost of the
delay time. The fault is tolerated by the grid topology of the network.
In the case of fault 1, when a data packet is transmitted to a destination node on the
Row 1, the original token grid with link fault 1 has to bypass the disconnected ring by
a “Wrong Route”. For example, if the destination of the data packet is node (1, 2),
node (1, 1) routes the packet by two merge configurations at Node (2, 1) and Node (4,
2) respectively to turn around the link with fault 1. For the EGNTB with the fault 1,
additional delay is observed in the two transmissions which have the destination
nodes are node (1, 3) and node (1, 4) respectively. The RTB 1 is cut into two pieces
and thus additional merge configuration is requested to route the data packet. Local
connection of the two logical sub rings on row 1 is preserved. Meanwhile, the data
packet transmission from node (1, 1) to node (1, 2) has less delay on the sub logical
ring than that on the original proper logical ring. Because of the factors, the additional
delay cost is less than that of the original token grid.
With the link fault 1, the addition of the fault 2, 3 or 4 to the networks has the same
effect on the transmission from Node (1, 1) to the destination nodes not on the same
columns and rows (nine such nodes in the Fig. 3(a) neither in Row 1 nor in Column
1). Some nodes are requested to be in merged configuration to fulfill the data transmission task. The more faults exit in the network, the more nodes with the merging
configuration is requested. However, while a link fault can break out the communication on the row or column in the original e-textile token grid, the logical rings in
EGNBT can tolerate some bus faults for the sub logical rings still connect the nodes
locally.
In the presence of all the four link/bus faults, the original e-textile token grid is
disabled and thus the time delay is an infinite value. The EGNTB can maintain the
full network connectivity, but the delay cost is approximately two times that of the
network without any faults. Table 1 lists the results obtained from the simulation
experiments. These results show the EGNTB can improve the ability of e-textile
applications to tolerate faults. On the occasions of same faults discussed above, the
new network can provide the communication services of less delay time. Furthermore, the feature of a graceful variation of performance with the number of faults is
also inherited.

4 Conclusions
The harsh environment of e-textile applications requires a fault-tolerant communication scheme to reduce the time cost of faults or low power operations. In this paper,
we introduce token buses to connect the nodes in e-textiles, instead of the single rings.
Based on the specific protocol, the EGNTB implements the operations logically similar to the original token grid network. Thanks to the token bus, the new network inherits the high reliability of the bus topology and has the same approximate throughput with uniform load.
Simulation results show the new communication network proposed in this paper
can enhance the ability of e-textile applications to tolerate faults. In the presence of
same faults, the new network can provide the communication services of less delay
time. And even when a fabric is torn into several parts, the full-connectivity in the
local parts is also preserved in every fragments of the fabric. Furthermore, the
EGNTB inherits the feature that the network performance degrades gracefully as the
number of faults increases.
