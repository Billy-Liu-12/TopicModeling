Abstract. In this paper, The optimized 2D-TLM as been introduced and applied
to rectangular waveguides which is widely used. Results obtained by using
optimized 2D-TLM were compared with analytic results and shown to be
accurate.

1 Introduction
Rectangular waveguide is one of the earliest type of the transmission lines and still
commonly used in many current applications. A lot of components such as isolators,
detectors, attenuators, couplers and slotted lines are available to use for various
standard waveguide bands between 1 GHz to above 220 GHz [1]. At the operating
frequencies where these waveguides commonly used, the assumptions which are valid
only low frequencies can not be applied to gain accurate results. Therefore full-wave
analysis techniques must be required. Some of these full-wave numerical techniques
solve the problem in time domain [2-4] whereas others solve in frequency domain [47]. Although full-wave numerical technique gives accurate results, it requires more
time and computer resources for solutions. The demands of the design engineer
require a technique which is accurate, yet retains the interactive design capabilities
of the simpler techniques.
In this contribution, time and frequency domain analysis of rectangular waveguide
has been accurately analyzed by enhanced 2-D TLM method and shown to be
accurate to find mode cut-off frequency.

2 Review to Rectangular Waveguides
The rectangular waveguide shown in Fig. 1 supports both TM and TE modes;
therefore it is not possible to define unique voltage by only using TEM waves at the
recent operating frequencies. The waves cannot propagate trough the rectangular
waveguide if the operating frequency is below then some certain frequency. This
frequency is called cut-off frequency. The mode frequency must be higher then this
cut-off frequency. If mode frequency is lower then cut-off frequency, propagating
waves decay rapidly in the direction of waveguides axes. When the operating
frequency is higher then cut-off frequency, waves have two modes. These are TE and
TM modes respectively. The cut-off frequency has been only determined by geometry
of the wave guides.

3 Optimized 2D-TLM Method
TLM was first introduced by P. N. John in 1970. This technique is based on the field
theory – the circuit theory similarities. Transmission line modeling divides the
structure into unit cells and structure model is carried out by solving each cell

separately. Current and voltage are set to be independent variables. The correlation
between input and output voltage is found by applying Kirchoff current and voltage
laws onto Fig. 2 which is circuit model of the cell analyzed.
TLM method like FDTD is interested in Maxwell equations. Given microwave
structure which is rectangular waveguide in this application has been divided into
cells. Each cell has been traded as electrical circuit and therefore electrical circuit
solution has been applied onto the every cell repeatedly. The main advantage of TLM
against MoM or SDM, TDM does not require any pre-calculation. As a result of this
advantage, any optimization can be applied to any microwave circuits without
refinements. Another reason to choose TLM for this contribution is that TLM method
is very easy to adapt on the computer programming.
2D-TLM Equation is given by;

can be easily found. c is free space light speed in Equation (6).

4 Computer Simulation and Numerical Results
First analyzed mode and then maximum frequency of the interest must be
determined. Because this process is necessary to specify time step and cell size of
TLM simulation. To avoid numerical dispersion, the ratio of minimum wavelength
and cell must be chosen carefully. Rectangular waveguide analyzed by TLM has
divided into NxxNy number of cells so that ∆x and ∆y are cell sizes in x –y axes

respectively. As a source, Gauss pulse of which durations have been chosen
according to maximum operating frequency used. Gauss pulse is applied at one
point, and the calculated field’s components of observation points are saved. The
frequency response of rectangular waveguides has been derived from the time
response.
