Abstract. In this paper, we propose an efficient mobility management scheme
in a two-level Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) architecture. A mobile node
chooses a suitable Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) according to its average dwell
time and its number of connecting correspondent nodes. Furthermore, a higher
MAP may adjust the threshold of MAP selection algorithm periodically
according to its traffic load.

1 Introduction
Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [1] was proposed to reduce the amount of
registration between the mobile node (MN), its home agent and correspondent nodes
(CNs). To improve the performance of HMIPv6 further, many schemes [2-5]
proposed that the MN choose a suitable MAP according to its mobility characteristics.
For example, Kawano et al. [4-5] introduced a multilevel HMIPv6 architecture and a
speed based MAP selection algorithm. However, these algorithms did not consider the
influence of traffic parameter of an MN, i.e. the number of connecting CNs. Thus
reduction of registration cost that achieved by mobility based algorithm is limited.
In this paper, we propose a mobility and traffic based MAP selection algorithm for
two-level HMIPv6 architecture. In addition, a dynamic adjustment mechanism is
introduced to reduce the registration cost further, in which a higher MAP may adjust
the threshold of MAP selection periodically according to its traffic load.

2 Proposed Scheme
2.1 MAP Selection
We combine the number of CNs (Nc) and dwell time (Tf) as the parameter for MAP
selection (called “combined measure”, referred to as “C”). The following equation is
used to compute C.

C = (1 + N c ) / T f

The MAP selection strategy is defined as:

⎧ MAPh
MA = ⎨
⎩ MAPl

C > Tc
C ≤ Tc

(2)

where MA indicates the chosen MAP and Tc denotes the threshold of combined
measure. MAPh and MAPl denote higher MAP and lower MAP, respectively.
2.2 Dynamic Adjustment
If Nc of each MN often changes, a fixed threshold can not minimize the inter-domain
registration cost. Based on this observation we propose the dynamic adjustment
mechanism. Each higher MAP periodically checks the number of its serving MNs
(Nm) and compares Nm with its capacity (Cmap). Assume the checking interval is I. We
use “Sat” to denote the saturation degree of a higher MAP, which is equal to Nm/Cmap.
The higher MAP adjusts Tc according to its current Sat as follows:

Tc _ n

⎧ Tc _ o × (1 + β )
⎪
= ⎨ Tc _ o
⎪ T × (1 − β )
⎩ c_o

Sat > Sat h
Sat h ≥ Sat ≥ Sat l
Sat < Sat l

(3)

where Tc_n and Tc_o are the new threshold and the old threshold. Sath and Satl denote
two thresholds for adjustment decision. β indicates the degree of adjustment and is a
positive constant less than 1.
To deploy proposed scheme, two fields are included into the MAP option:
z
z

L: a bit lies after “R” bit, indicating the level of an MAP. “1” refers to a
higher MAP and “0” refers to a lower MAP.
Threshold: updated Tc for MAP selection. It is valid when “L” bit is set. It
is 64 bits long and lies before “lifetime” field.

3 Performance Evaluation
3.1 Simulation Model
There are 16 higher MAPs distributed in the simulated grid network. Each higher
MAP is connected by 16 lower MAPs and each lower MAP covers 4 subnets. There
are “high speed MNs” and “low speed MNs”, with dwell time Tf1 and Tf2
respectively, which follow the uniform distribution with parameters [5s,10s] and
[10s,15s]. We set the ratio of high speed MNs to low speed MNs to 1:1. Mobile nodes
are also divided into two classes according to their traffic parameters. Nc for low
traffic MNs may be 0 and 1, and Nc for high traffic MNs may be 5 and 6. The ratio of
these two traffic classes is defined as a simulation parameter (RT).
We consider three schemes. The first is the traditional mobility based MAP
selection scheme, in which high/low speed MNs choose higher/lower MAPs. The
second is the combined measure based MAP selection algorithm. And the last scheme

deploys dynamic adjustment mechanism on the basis of the second scheme. The three
schemes are referred to as Speed scheme, Comb scheme and Comb_D scheme. The
simulation time is 5,000 seconds. Each experiment is repeated ten times and the
average result is presented. Table 1 summarizes the major parameters.

3.2 Simulation Results
From Fig. 1 we find that the number of binding updates (referred to as Nb) of the three
solutions all increases with increasing NM. The percentage reductions of registration
cost obtained by Comb and Comb_D schemes over Speed scheme are approximately
25% and 45% respectively.

We modify RT to simulate the scenario in which Nc of the MN changes. Served
by the same MAP, an MN with more CNs issues more binding updates. Thus more
high traffic MNs indicates larger registration cost in Speed scheme, as shown in
Fig. 2. On the contrary, the Comb scheme shows its adaptability to various ratios of
traffic classes because high traffic MNs try to choose higher MAPs according to our
novel MAP selection algorithm. As for Comb_D scheme, when the number of high
traffic MNs is low, the higher MAP will reduce its threshold to allow more MNs to

be served. As the number of high traffic MNs increases, more MNs are originally
served by higher MAPs. Thus performance gain by deploying dynamic adjustment
decreases.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a mobility and traffic based MAP selection algorithm and a
dynamic adjustment mechanism to reduce the registration cost outside MAP domains
in a two-level HMIPv6 architecture. Taking traffic parameter into account, the novel
MAP selection algorithm achieves better performance in reducing overall registration
cost than mobility based MAP selection algorithm. In addition, dynamic adjustment
prevents saturation degree of the higher MAP from being a small value so that it
reduces the registration cost further.
