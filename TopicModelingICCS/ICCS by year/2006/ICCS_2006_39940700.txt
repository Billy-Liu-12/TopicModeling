Abstract. We consider the new family of two step Runge–Kutta–
Nystr¨
om methods for the numerical integration of y = f (x, y), which
provide approximation for the solution and its ﬁrst derivative at the step
point, and depend on the stage values at two consecutive step points.
We derive the conditions to obtain methods within this family, which integrate algebraic polynomials exactly, describe a constructive technique
and analyze the order of the resulting method.

Introduction

We are concerned with the analysis of a family of two step methods for the
numerical integration of second order Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations, in which
the ﬁrst derivative does not appear explicitly,
y (t) = f (t, y(t)),

y(t0 ) = y0 ,

y (t0 ) = y0 ,

y(t), f (t, y) ∈ Rn ,

(1)

having a periodic or an oscillatory solution. The initial value problem (1) often arises in applications of molecular dynamics, orbital mechanics, seismology.
When the response time is extremely important, for example in simulation processes, there is the need of obtaining an accurate solution in a reasonable time
frame, and therefore there is a great demand of eﬃcient methods for the direct
integration of problem (1).
Many methods with constant coeﬃcients have already been derived for second order ODEs (1) with periodic or oscillatory solutions: see for example
[5, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15] for an extensive bibliography.
In this paper we consider the following generalization of the two step Runge–
Kutta–Nystr¨
om (TSRKN) methods introduced in [14], by introducing the stage
values at two consecutive step points, in order to increase the order of the methods, as already done in [9] for ﬁrst order ODEs:

In [14] the TSRKN method was derived as an indirect method from the two
step Runge–Kutta methods introduced in [9]. The reason of interest in methods
TSRKN (1.2) lies in the fact that, advancing from xi to xi+1 we only have
to compute Yi , because Yi−1 has alreay been evaluated in the previous step.
Therefore the computational cost of the method depends on the matrix A, while
the vectors v and v
¯ add extra degrees of freedom.
Our aim is to analyze two step implicit methods of type (2) which integrate
algebraic polynomials exactly. The main motivation for the development of implicit methods (2), as those considered in the present paper, is their property
of having a high stage order which make them suitable for stiﬀ systems, also
because their implicitness. Collocation–based methods also belong to this class.
In Section 2 we extend Albrecht’s approach [1, 2] to the family (2), with the
aim to derive the conditions for TSRKN methods to integrate algebraic polynomials exactly. In Section 3 we consider the collocation–based methods of type (2).

TSRKN Methods Based on Algebraic Polynomials

Let us consider the TSRKN methods (2). It is known that the method (2) is
zero–stable if [14]
−1 < θ ≤ 1

(3)

We treat formulas (2) by extending Albrecht’s technique [1, 2] to the numerical
method in concern, as we already have done in [11] for Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om
methods, and in [13] for two step Runge–Kutta methods. According to this

702

B. Paternoster

approach, we regard the two step Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om method (2) as a composite linear multistep scheme, but on a non–uniform grid.
We associate a linear diﬀerence operator with each stage, in the following way:
Lj [z(x); h] = z(x + cj h) − uj,1 z(x − h) − uj,2 z(x)−
h (uj,1 z (x − h) +
h2

m
s=1 (ajs z

uj,2 z (x))−

(4)

(x + (cs − 1)h) + bjs z (x + cs h),

for j = 1, . . . , m, is associated with the internal stage Ynj of (2).
¯
L[z(x);
h] = z(x + h) − θ1 z(x − h) − θ2 z(x)−
h(η1 z (x − h) + η2 z (x))−
h2

m
j=1 (vj z

(5)

(x + (cj − 1)h) + wj z (x + cj h)),

is associated with the stage yn+1 in (2). Finally
L¯ [z(x); h] = hz (x + h) − θ1 z(x − h) − θ2 z(x)−
h(η1 z (x − h) + η2 z (x))−
h2

m
j=1 (vj z

(6)

(x + (cj − 1)h) + wj z (x + cj h))

is associated with the ﬁnal stage yn+1 in (2).
Obviously the following relation holds:
Lj [1; h] = 0,

j = 1, . . . , m,

and
¯ h] = L¯ [1; h] = 0
L[1;
from which the parameters of the method have to satisfy the following relations:
uj,1 + uj,2 = 1,

j = 1, . . . , m

(7)

θ1 + θ2 = 1,

θ1 + θ2 = 0.

(8)

In order to have the consistency of the internal stages, the following relation
hold:
Lj [x; h] = 0,

j = 1, . . . , m,

which holds if
cj + uj1 = uj,1 + uj,2

(9).

(9) implies that y(xi + cj h) − Yij = O(h) for h → 0. In the same way the ﬁnal
¯ h] = L¯ [x; h] = L¯ [x2 ; h] = 0, that is
stages are consistent if L[x;
1 + θ1 = η1 + η2 ,

1 + θ1 = η1 + η2 ,

If (4) is identically equal to zero when z(x) = xp , i.e. if Lj [xp ; h] = 0, then it

We can now give the following deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 1. An m–stage TSRKN method (2) is said to satisfy the simplifying
conditions AB2 (p), V W2 (p) and V W2 (p) if its parameters satisfy respectively:

)=
j

(k + 1) − (−1)k+1 θ1 − (−1)k (k + 1) η1
.
k(k + 1)

for k = 1, . . . , p.
AB2 (p), V W2 (p) and V W2 (p) allow the reduction of order conditions of trees
in the theory of two step RKN methods, which is under development by the
authors of this paper; moreover they also mean that all the quadrature formulas
represented by the TSRKN method have order at least p, similarly as it happens
in the theory of Runge–Kutta methods [3].
As far as the order is concerned, we follow the classical deﬁnition of convergence of order p, related with the local truncation error. As a consequence, the
conditions which we are going to formulate, are given for exact starting values
y1 , y1 , Y0j , j = 1, . . . , m, as already done, for instance, in [6].
Deﬁnition 2. An m–stage TSRKN method (2) has order p if for suﬃciently
smooth problems (1), and for exact starting values y1 , y1 , Y0j , j = 1, . . . , m,
y(x1 + h) − y1 = O(hp+1 ), hy (x1 + h) − hy1 = O(hp+2 )

(14)

By using Albrecht’s theory [1, 2], it is easy to prove the following theorem:
Theorem 1. If AB2 (p), V W2 (p) and V W2 (p) hold, then for exact starting values
the m–stage TSRKN method (2) has order of convergence p.
Proof. AB2 (p), V W2 (p) and V W2 (p) imply that all the stages of the method
have order p or, in Albrecht’s terminology, that each stage in (4)–(6) has order
of consistency p, so that the method has order of consistency p. In this case the
method converges with order at least p.
It is worth mentioning that the conditions AB2 (p), V W2 (p) and V W2 (p) are
only suﬃcient conditions for the TSRKN method to have order p, but not necessary. If all the stages have order of consistency p, then all the stages are exact on
any linear combination of the power set {1, x, x2 , . . . , xp }, and this implies that
the TSRKN method results exact when the solutions of the system of ODEs (1)
are algebraic polynomials. Moreover the simplifying conditions AB2 (p), V W2 (p)
and V W2 (p) are a constructive help for the derivation of new numerical methods
within the family of TSRKN methods.

Collocation Methods

Let us generalize the Deﬁnition 3.2 of [7], in order to derive collocation methods
for (1):

om Methods

705

Deﬁnition 3. Consider m real numbers c1 , . . . , cm ∈ [0, 1], the solution values
yn , yn−1 and the derivative values yn , yn−1 . The collocation polynomial P (x) of
degree 2m + 3 is then deﬁned by:
P (xn−1 ) = yn−1 ,

P (xn ) = yn

(14)

P (xn−1 ) = yn−1 ,

P (xn ) = yn

(15)

P (xn−1 + ci h) = f (xn−1 + ci h, P (xn−1 + ci h)),

(16)

P (xn + ci h) = f (xn + ci h, P (xn + ci h)).

(17)

Then the numerical solution of (1) is given by
yn+1 = P (xn+1 ),

yn+1 = P (xn+1 )

(18)

(14)–(18) constitute a Hermite interpolation problem with incomplete data, because the function values at xn + ci h are missing. Following [7], to compute
the collocation polynomial P (x), we introduce the dimensionless coordinate
t = (x − xn )/h, x = xn + th, with nodes t1 = −1, t2 = 0, and deﬁne the
following polynomials, which constitute a generalized Lagrange basis:
– φi (t), i = 1, 2, of degree 2m + 3, deﬁned by
φi (tj ) = δij ,

φi (tj ) = 0,

i, j = 1, 2,

φi (cj − 1) = 0, φi (cj ) = 0, i = 1, 2, j = 1, . . . , m,

(19)
(20)

– ψi (t), i = 1, 2, of degree 2m + 3, deﬁned by
ψi (tj ) = 0,

ψ (tj ) = δij ,

ψi (cj − 1) = 0,

i, j = 1, 2,

ψi (cj ) = 0, i = 1, 2, j = 1, . . . , m,

(21)
(22)

– χi,n−1 (t) and χi,n (t), i = 1, . . . , m, of degree 2m + 3, deﬁned by
χi,n−1 (tj ) = 0,

χi,n (tj ) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, 2

(23)

χi,n−1 (tj ) = 0,

χi,n (tj ) = 0,

i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, 2

(24)

χi,n−1 (cj − 1) = δij ,
χi,n (cj − 1) = 0,

χi,n−1 (cj ) = 0,
χi,n (cj ) = δij ,

i, j = 1, . . . , m,
i, j = 1, . . . , m.

(25)
(26)

δij denotes the Kronecker tensor. Then the expression of the collocation polynomial P (x) in terms of these polynomials is given by:
P (xn + th) = φ1 (t) yn−1 + φ2 (t) yn + h( ψ1 (t) yn−1 +
ψ2 (t) yn ) +

h2

m
j=1

(χj,n−1 (t) P (xn−1 + cj h) +
+

χj,n (t) P (xn + cj h)).

After constructing φi (t), ψi (t), χi,n−1 (t) and χi,n (t), by putting t = ci ,
by writing P (xn + ci h) = Yni and by inserting the collocation conditions (14)–
(17), we obtain the expression of the two step Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om (TSRKN)
collocation method of type (2), where the parameters of the method are given
by the following relations:
θi = φi (1),

uj,i = φi (cj ),

i = 1, 2, j = 1, . . . , m

ηi = ψi (1),

uj,i = ψi (cj ),

i = 1, 2, j = 1, . . . , m

vj = χj,n−1 (1),

ajs = χj,n−1 (cs ),

wj = χj,n (1),

bjs = χj,n (cs ),

θi = φi (1),
vj = χj,n−1 (1),

ηi = ψi (1),
wj = χj,n (1),

j, s, = 1, . . . , m,
j, s, = 1, . . . , m
i = 1, 2,
j = 1, . . . , m,

and φi (t), ψi (t), χi,n−1 (t) and χi,n (t) are the polynomials deﬁned by conditions
(19)–(26).

Conclusions

We have considered the family of TSRKN methods for y = f (x, y) which integrate algebraic polynomials exactly. Following the procedure showed in this
paper, that is annihilating the linear diﬀerence operators (4)–(6) on the set of
power functions, and solving the arising systems AB2 (p + 1), V W2 (p + 1) and
V W2 (p) , it is possible to derive TSRKN methods for ODEs (1) of order of
convergence p. If p = 2m + 2, then the method is of collocation type.
Following the procedure showed in this paper, that is annihilating the
linear diﬀerence operators (4)–(6) on diﬀerent basis of functions, it is possible to derive TSRKN methods for ODEs having solutions with an already
known behaviour. For example, it is worth considering TSRKN methods for
ODEs (1) having periodic or oscillatory solution, for which the dominant frequency ω is known in advance; in this case a proper set of functions is the
basis {1, cos ωx, sin ωx, cos 2ωx, sin 2ωx, . . .} for trigonometric polynomials, as
already considered in [11, 13] for Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om and two step RungeKutta methods. The technique used in this paper can also be applied for the
construction of collocation methods within family (2).
