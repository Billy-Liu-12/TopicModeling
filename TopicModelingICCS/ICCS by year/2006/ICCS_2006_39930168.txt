Abstract. The subject of this paper is the theory of fault distinguishable discrete

event systems. Any such system is modelled by a live, bounded, and reversible
place-transition net. The notions of D-partition of the set of places P of a given
place-transition net N and net k-distinguishability are first introduced. The
system k-distinguishability measure is obtained in a unique way from the placeinvariant matrix. For a large value of k, the system model is extended by using
some set of additional places called test points. It is shown that the test point
placement process will not change the above-assumed original net properties.
Several examples are given.

1 Introduction
The use of Petri net models in diagnosis and reliable design of event-driven systems is
a subject of interest to researchers since more than twenty years. In general, the most
of the studies in this area focus attention on dynamical analysis concerning
specification and implementation of some fault detection, fault diagnosis and/or fault
recovery procedures, e.g. using partially stochastic Petri nets [1], or also using trace
analysis [5], etc. The study of the system fault indistinguishability properties seems to
be important because of the following two reasons. First, we have an additional
possibility of describing the critical components of the considered system. Second,
there exists a possibility of using some simple and at the same time exact tools for
improving the system (self-) diagnosis capabilities in the early stages of its design
[2,8,9,10,11,12].
The subject of this paper is the theory of fault distinguishable discrete event
systems. Any such system is modelled by a live, bounded, and reversible placetransition net. The notions of D-partition of the set of places P of a given placetransition net N and net k-distinguishability are first introduced. Next these two
notions are extended to the set of all vertices, i.e. places and transitions of N . So the
problem of fault identification of the vertices of N is transformed as a problem of
fault identification of the places of a new net N´ called a net simulator of N . Any
transition in N´ is assumed to be fault-free. Then the corresponding net place
invariants are computed. The system k-distinguishability measure is obtained in a
unique way from the place-invariant matrix. For a large value of k, the system model
is extended by using some set of additional places called test points. It is shown that
the test point placement process will not change the above-assumed original net
properties. Several examples are given.

2 Basic Notions
In general any place-transition net N =df (T,P,A,M0,K,W), where (T,P,A) is a
finite net containing sets of transitions , places, and arcs called also edges, K : P →
( INω − {0}) and W : A → ℕ are the corresponding place capacity and edge
multiplicity (called also weight) functions, respectively. The initial marking vector
M0 : P → INω , where ℕ denotes the set of all natural numbers, IN =df ℕ ∪
{0}, IN ω =df IN ∪ {ω}, and ω is an infinite number such that: ω + k =
ω and k < ω (for any k ∈ IN ) [6,7]. The forward marking class of N, i.e. [ M0
> =df { M ∈ IN ω P / ∃ τ ∈ T∗ ( M0[τ >M ) }.
In the next considerations we shall assume N is a pure, live and bounded net. In the
case of manufacturing systems the net reversibility property is also required. The net Pinvariants are computed using N ⋅ i = 0, where N is the PN-connectivity matrix of
N. The support of any P-invariant i with respect to N (in short: wrt N) is defined as
follows: supp(i) =df {p ∈ P / i(p) ≠ 0 } ⊆ P . Let I be the set of all (positive) Pinvariants of N and J ⊆ I is a subset. The P-invariant matrix of N wrt J is
introduced as follows: J : J × P → IN , where J (i,p) =df i(p) ∈ IN . For
convenience only, we shall assume below that the P-cover J of N is a set of all positive
and minimal P-invariants. Also we shall use the notion of the revised P-invariant matrix
of N, defined as: ρ : J × P → {0,1}, where ρ(i,p) =df 1 iff i(p) ≠ 0 [2]. For
simplicity, it is assumed below N have a P-cover. Otherwise, this method is also
applicable. In the last case some additional test points is necessary to be introduced.

3 Net k-Distinguishability and Test Points
Let [ M0 >α =df [ M0 > ∪ { Mα}, where M0 is the initial marking and Mα is a marking
of N such that Mα ∉ [ M0 > . We shall say Mα is a faulty marking. Since M i = M0 i
(for any M ∈ [M0 > and i ∈ J ) [6] then ∆M i = 0 , where ∆M =df M − M0. The last
property is satisfied for any P-invariant i ∈ J . Hence we can obtain J ∆MT = 0.
Therefore for M ∈ [M0 >α the above equation may be violated. Thus we have: J ∆MT
= a ∈ {0,1}⎜J ⎜ (for any M ∈ [ M0 >α, obviously a = 0 iff M ∈ [M0 > ). Without losing
any generality, below (a)s ≠ 0 are interpreted as (a)s = 1 ( s ∈ {1,..., ⎜J ⎜} ). Hence, in
accordance with [4], any (a)s =1 will correspond to some subset of places supp(is) ⊆ P
having a (potentially) faulty behaviour. Let P ⊇ Ω(a) =df ∩ supp(is) / (a)s = 1 ∩ ∩
supp(is)´ / (a)s = 0 , where supp(is)´ =df P − supp(is) is the corresponding set
complement operation. So, like [3] the notion of D-partition can be introduced.
Below are used some basic notions given in [8].
Definition 1
By a D-partition of the set of places P of a given place-transition net N wrt the Pcover J of N , denoted by Ω(N,J ) , or Ω if N and J are understood , we shall
mean the (multi) family Ω =df { Ω(a) / a ∈ {0,1}⎜J ⎜}.

The notion of a k-distinguishable place-transition net under a D-partition of the set of
places P of N is given in the next definition.
Definition 2
The Petri net N is a k-distinguishable net under Ω iff
(i)

∃ Ω(a) ∈ Ω ( ⎜Ω(a) ⎜ = k) and

(ii) ∀ Ω(a) ∈ Ω ( ⎜Ω(a) ⎜ ≤ k).
The support of any D-partition is defined as follows: supp(Ω) =df { Ω(a) ∈ Ω /
Ω(a) ≠ ∅ }. Let π(P) be the partition generated by the set of subsets of places (i.e.
classes), such that each class consists of places having identical columns in the revised
P-invariant matrix ρ of N. The following proposition is satisfied (a more formal proof
is given in [11]).
Proposition 2 [2]
supp(Ω) = π(P).

Definition 3
Let N be a place-transition net. Then N is a k-distinguishable net iff ∃ N´ ( N´ is a
net simulator of N and N´ is a k-distinguishable net under Ω´ ).
Definition 4
Let p k ∈ P be a given place of N such that the pre-set i p k

post-set p k i =df {t2}, where t1 and t2 are two different transitions of N. The

It can be observed that in some cases the considered Petri net may be maximally
indistinguishable, e.g. a net which is a state-machine net and a marked graph at the
same time. Then the corresponding P-cover will contain only one P-invariant having
all components equal to one.
Proposition 3
Let N be a directed elementary cycle having m places (m > 1). Then N becomes
(2m − r)-distinguishable if r additional test points are placed ( 1 ≤ r ≤ 2m − 1).

A generalisation of Definition 3 for non-ordinary place-transition nets (i.e. nets
having some edges a ∈ A with weights w(a) ≠ 1) is omitted here. Any such
generalisation of the last definition for place-transition nets, which are not ordinary,
would require an isomorphism between the corresponding reachability graphs RG(N)
ˆ ) (see Example 1 and Theorem 2 given below). Let Pa =df Ω(a) (for any
and RG( N
a ∈ {0,1}⎜J ⎜). Obviously Pa ∈ supp(Ω) if Pa ≠ ∅.
Definition 5
Let Pa ≠ ∅, Ta =df iPa ∪ Pai and Aa =df A ∩ (( Ta × Pa ) ∪ ( Pa × Ta)) .
The corresponding subnet Na =df (Ta , Pa, Aa) of N is called a graphical
representation of Pa . We shall say Na is a marked graph component (or MGcomponent) iff ∀p ∈ Pa ( ⎜ip ⎜ = ⎜pi⎜ = 1). The subset of places Pa is
said to be a MG-component generator.
Theorem 1[10]

Assume that N a live and bounded place-transition net having ⎜P ⎜ ≥ 2 and
supp(Ω) =df { Pa , Pa , ... , Pa }, where 1 ≤ n < ⎜P ⎜. If any Pa ∈ supp(Ω) is a

In a natural manner, the last two propositions can be extended for non-ordinary placetransition nets. This is illustrated in the next example.

=df b. The obtained P-invariant ˆi is minimal and positive.
An example test point placement is shown in Figure 1(b) where an example live,
bounded, and reversible place-transition net is presented. Assume that T = {t1,t2} is
a fault-free. According to Proposition 2 the considered net N is 2-distinguishable

Consider N of Figure 2(a) describing the behaviour of a system consisting of one
write- and three read-authorised processes [4,6,7]. The following P-cover can be
obtained: J = {i1,i2,i3} , where: i1 = (1,1,1,0,0,0,0), i2 = (0,0,0,1,1,1,0) and i3

test point improving is shown in Figure 2(b). The net N becomes 2-distinguishable
for J = {i2,i3,i4} or also J = {i1,i2,i4}, where i4 = (0,3,0,0,1,0,1). In the last case
the number of test points can be reduced to 2 (e.g. by removing p9). {Df.2, Prop.2, T1} □

5 Conclusions
The above-considered approach gives a possibility of fault isolation in concurrent
systems. This process is realised by using the Petri net model of the considered
system. The degree of accuracy to which faults can be located, i.e. the diagnostic
resolution is given in unique way by the obtained k-distinguishability measure. The
complexity of the proposed method depends on the efficiency of the existing
algorithms for computation of the P-cover, i.e. the set of P-invariants covering N. The
choice of diagnosis strategies, i.e. combinational or also sequential is depending on
the used time requirements for testing. Moreover, an additional cost-minimisation can
be obtained by assuming the considered test point set as a “hardcore”. This approach

can be extended for higher level Petri nets, e.g. such as coloured nets or also to design
self-diagnosable circuit realisations of Boolean interpreted Petri nets.
