Abstract. In this paper we present the ﬁrst application of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to Voice Activity Detection (VAD).
The accuracy of a multiple observation-likelihood ratio test (MO-LRT)
VAD is improved by transforming the set of observations to a new set
of independent components. Clear improvements in speech/non-speech
discrimination accuracy for low false alarm rate demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed VAD. It is shown that the use of this new set
leads to a better separation of the speech and noise distributions, thus
allowing a more eﬀective discrimination and a tradeoﬀ between complexity and performance. The algorithm is optimum in those scenarios where
the loss of speech frames could be unacceptable, causing a system failure. The experimental analysis carried out on the AURORA 3 databases
and tasks provides an extensive performance evaluation together with
an exhaustive comparison to the standard VADs such as ITU G.729,
GSM AMR and ETSI AFE for distributed speech recognition (DSR),
and other recently reported VADs.

Introduction

The demands of modern applications of speech communication are related to
the need for increasing levels of performance in noise adverse environments. The
new voice services including discontinuous speech transmission [1] or distributed
speech recognition (DSR) over wireless and IP networks [2] are examples of such
applications. These systems often require a noise reduction scheme working in
combination with a precise VAD in order to palliate the harmful eﬀect of the
acoustic environment on the speech signal. Thus, numerous researchers have
studied diﬀerent strategies for detecting speech in noise and the inﬂuence of the
VAD on the performance of speech processing systems [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Recently, an
improved VAD using a long-term LRT test deﬁned on the Bispectra coeﬃcients
[8] has shown signiﬁcant improvements of the decision rule but with high computational cost. The latter VAD is based on a MO-LRT over a set of averaged
bispectrum coeﬃcients yk which are assumed to be independent. This approach

is also assumed in the Fourier domain [7]. We use the latter algorithm in conjunction with the recursive PCA algorithm presented in [9] to build an eﬃcient
“on line” VAD, assessing its performance in an HMM-based speech recognition
system.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the Blind
Source Separation (BSS) problem when dealing with Gaussian distributions. In
section 3 we review the theoretical background related to MO-LRT applied to
VAD showing the proposed signal model and analyzing the motivations for the
proposed algorithm by showing the speech/non-speech correlation plots. Section
4 introduce a variation on the recursive PCA for the evaluation of the decision
rule. Section 5 describes the experimental framework considered for the evaluation of the proposed statistical decision algorithm. Finally, in section we state
some conclusions.

BSS in Gaussian Scenario

Let us denote by x = (x1 , . . . , xm ) a zero m-dimensional random variable that
can be observed and s = (s1 , . . . , sm ) its m-dimensional statistically independent
transform satisfying that:
s = Wx
(1)
where W is a constant (weight) square matrix. The BSS problem [10, 11] is to determine the previous matrix extracting the independent features si , i = 1, . . . , m
and assuming W is constant. There are some ambiguities in the determination
of the linear model (i.e. variances and order of independent components) but
fortunately they are insigniﬁcant in most applications.
The multivariate Gaussian probability density function (pdf) of an m × 1
random variable vector x is deﬁned as:
p(x) =

1
(2π)m/2 det1/2 (R(x))

1
−1
exp − (x − μ)T R(x) (x − μ)
2

(2)

where μ is the mean vector and R(x) is the covariance matrix. It is assumed that
R(x) is positive deﬁnite and hence R(x)−1 exists. The mean vector is deﬁned
as [μ]i = E(xi ), i = 1, . . . m and the covariance matrix as R(x) = E((x −
E(x))(x − E(x))T )). Uncorrelated jointly Gaussian variables (i.e. components of
vector x in equation 2) satisfy that:
m

p(xi )

p(x) =

(3)

i=1

since its covariance matrix is diagonal. That is, they are statistically independent, then decorrelation and statistical independence are equivalent for jointly
Gaussian variables. In VAD applications, the DFT coeﬃcients of the incoming signal are usually assumed to be Gaussian independent somehow, using the
model of overlapped MO-window (see section 3), they are not.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a very eﬃcient and popular tool for
extracting uncorrelated components from a set of signals. PCA tries to ﬁnd a
linear transformation (Karhunen-Lo´eve) s = WT x into a new orthogonal basis
(columns of W) such that the covariance matrix in the new system is diagonal.
Since R(x) is symmetric we can ﬁnd W such that:
WT R(x)W =Λ

(4)

Hence the PCA decorrelates the vector x also achieving statistical independence
when it is multivariate Gaussian distributed1 .

PCA-MO-Likelihood Ratio Test

In a two hypothesis test (ω0 =noise & ω1 =speech in noise), the optimal decision
rule that minimizes the error probability is the Bayes classiﬁer. Given an Jdimensional observation vector x
ˆ to be classiﬁed, the problem is reduced to
x).
selecting the class (ω0 or ω1 ) with the largest posterior probability P(ωi |ˆ
From the Bayes rule:
x|ω1 ) > P [ω0 ]

x
ˆ ↔ ω1
(5)
⇒
L(ˆ
x) =
x
ˆ ↔ ω0
px|ω0 (ˆ
x|ω0 ) < P [ω1 ]
In the LRT, it is assumed that the number of observations is ﬁxed and represented by a vector x
ˆ. The performance of the decision procedure can be improved
by incorporating more observations to the statistical test. When M = 2m + 1
ˆ−m+1 , . . . , x
ˆm are available in a two-class classiﬁcation
measurements x
ˆ−m , x
problem, a MO-LRT can be deﬁned by:
x−m , x
ˆ−m+1 , ..., x
ˆm ) =
LM (ˆ

x−m , x
ˆ−m+1 , ..., x
ˆm |ω1 )
px−m ,x−m+1 ,...,xm |ω1 (ˆ
px−m ,x−m+1 ,...,xm |ω0 (ˆ
x−m , x
ˆ−m+1 , ..., x
ˆm |ω0 )

In order to evaluate the proposed MO-LRT VAD on an incoming signal, an
adequate statistical model for the feature vectors in presence and absence of
speech needs to be selected. The model selected is similar to that used by Sohn
et al. [3] that assumes the DFT coeﬃcients of the clean speech (Sj ) and the
noise (Nj ) to be asymptotically independent Gaussian random variables. In our
case, the decision rule is formulated over a sliding window consisting of 2m + 1
observation vectors around the frame for which the decision is being made (see
ﬁgure 1), then we have to assume they are at least jointly Gaussian distributed
as in equation 2.
The PCA algorithm presented in the next section decorrelates the observed
sk hence the MO-LRT in equation 6
signals x
ˆk into a set of independent signal ˆ
can be expressed as:
l+m
ps |ω (ˆ
sk |ω1 )
(7)
ln k 1
l,m =
psk |ω0 (ˆ
sk |ω0 )
k=l−m

Observe how any transformation of the kind x = (VW)T x where V is a orthogonal
matrix (VVT = VT V = I) yields the same result.

Recursive PCA Applied to VAD

In order to recursively evaluate the LRT over the set of uncorrelated signals in
the current frame l we use a result in [9]. In the frame l + 1 the PCA components

238

for the MO-window l − m, . . . , l + m are computed as a function of the previous
MO-window centered at frame l. Since:
RM =

xi xTi =
i=1

M −1

RM−1 +
xM xTM

(11)

where M denotes the number of observation (M = 2m + 1), we obtain the
following recursive formula for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues:
QM M ΛM QTM = QM−1 [(M − 1)ΛM−1 + αM αTM ]QTM

(12)

where RM = QM ΛM QTM and αM = QTM−1 xM . Using a matrix perturbation
analysis approach of a matrix in the form (Λ + ααT ), we can obtain a recursion
for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors as [9]:
QM = [QM−1 (I + PV )]TM
ΛM = [(1 − λM )ΛM−1 + PΛ ]T−2
M

(13)

where TM is a diagonal matrix containing the inverses of the norms of each
column of the matrix in brackets (top); PV is an antisymmetric matrix whose
(i, j)th entry is αi αj /(λj + α2j − λi − α2j ) if j = i, and 0 if j = i; PΛ is a diagonal
matrix whose ith diagonal entry is α2i ; and λM is a memory depth parameter.
Using the set of equations 13 we can obtain the uncorrelated components of the
decision frame l from the decision frame l − 1 in a two step procedure: Let RM,l
denote the covariance matrix on the decision frame l of order M = 2m + 1.
1. From equation 13 obtain RM−1,l using RM,l and α = αl−m .
2. From equation 13 obtain RM,l+1 using RM−1,l and α = αl+m .
With the aim of this recursion, the proposed VAD is computationally eﬃcient
enough to be used on a real time application and eludes the iterative eigenvector
decomposition in each MO-window.

Experimental Framework

The ROC curves are used in this section for the evaluation of the proposed
VAD. These plots completely describe the VAD error rate and show the tradeoﬀ between the speech and non-speech error probabilities as the threshold varies.
The Aurora 3 Spanish SpeechDat-Car database was used in the analysis. This
database contains recordings in a car environment from close-talking and handsfree microphones. Utterances from the close-talking device with an average SNR
of about 25 dB were labeled as speech or non-speech for reference while the VAD
was evaluated on the hands-free microphone. Thus, the speech and non-speech
hit rates (HR1, HR0) were determined as a function of the decision threshold for
each of the VAD tested. In ﬁgure 2 we observe an example of the VAD operation
showing the components extracted by the recursive PCA and the correlation plot

FALSE ALARM RATE (FAR0)

recently reported VADs

over the set of overlapped windows which shows that the independent assumption
cannot be made.
Fig. 3 shows the ROC curves in the most unfavourable conditions (high-speed,
good road) with a 5 dB average SNR. It is shown that the ICA-VAD obtains very
good performance at low FAR0 (applications designed for speech detection) and
at the common working areas (F AR0 < 10 and HR0 > 80). This is motivated by
a shift-up and to the left of the ROC curve which enables working with improved
speech and non-speech hit-rates. In the middle area the VAD reproduces the
same accuracy as the previous work MO-LRT [7] using a completely diﬀerent
set of input signals (decorrelated). The improved detection rate over the latter
method is major in such applications. The proposed VAD outperforms the Sohn’s
VAD [3], which assumes a single observation in the decision rule together with an
HMM-based hangover mechanism, as well as standardized VADs such as G.729
and AMR and recently reported methods [5, 6, 4]. Thus, the proposed VAD works
with improved speech/non-speech hit-rates when compared to the most relevant
algorithms to date.

Conclusion

In this paper we have introduced the concept of Blind Source Separation in VAD
applications. We have shown that PCA can be used as a preprocessing step in
this scenario for improving the accuracy of LRT based VADs. The proposed
algorithm is optimum in those scenarios (F AR0 → 0) where the loss of speech
frames could be unacceptable, causing a system failure. The VADs have been
employed as a part of Speech Recognition Systems (i.e. ASR Systems) in the
last years providing signiﬁcant beneﬁts. Hence the proposed VAD can be used

Independent Component Analysis Applied to Voice Activity Detection

to obtain relevant improvements over all standardized VADs in speech/pause
detection accuracy and recognition performance.
