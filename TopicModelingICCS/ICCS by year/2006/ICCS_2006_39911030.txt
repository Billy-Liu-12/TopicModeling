Abstract. Delay measurement plays an important role in network QOS control.
Much work has been done about the measurement of end-to-end delay, this paper describes a mechanism estimating flow Number and average delay in AQM
router in the Internet. This estimate is obtained without collecting or analyzing
state information on individual flows.

1 Introduction
The estimation of connections and delay is useful for network QOS control and resource management. Much work has been done about the measurement of end-to-end
delay and several models were proposed[1]. Variously, this paper describes a mechanism estimating flow Number and average delay in an AQM[2] router in the Internet.
A linearized TCP/AQM dynamic model was developed[3]. The forward-path transfer function of the plant P( s ) = Ptcp ( s ) × Pqueue ( s ) × e − sR0 was given by

Ptcp ( s ) = (

R0C 2
2N
) /( s + 2 )

R0 C

(s) = (

) /( s + )

where N is load factor (number of TCP connections), R0 is round trip time, C is the
link capacity. The actuating signal produced by AQM controller also reflects the information of flows that traverse the router.

2 Estimating Average Flow Delay in an AQM Router
2.1 Estimating the Flow Number

By TCP/AQM model, we need estimate the flow number firstly. Several approaches
have been proposed previously to estimate the number of active flows competing for
bandwidth[4,5,6]. Stabilized RED (SRED) compares the arrival packet with recently
arrived packets in a ‘Zombie List’ and estimates the number of flows based on the hit
probability. Hash Rate Estimation (HRE) uses a similar method while bases on the
comparison of the incoming packet with the randomly selected backlogged packets in
the queue. Flow Random Early Detection (FRED) estimates the number of flows that
have packets queuing in the buffer. In FPIP, routers maintain a state table of long

flows to record the arrival time (prevtime) of the packet arrived lately from each long
flow.
The approaches described above are effective in specific environments, we use the
reference of the method “hit and miss” here. The main idea is to compare, whenever a
packet arrives at some buffer, the arriving packet with a randomly chosen packet that
recently preceded it into the buffer.
Considering the following situation, there are n flows passing through the router;
ri and pi respectively denote the flow rate and the buffer occupancy of flow i. Intuitively, rhit is the rate that the flow ID of incoming packet matches that of one randomly selected packet in the queue and rmiss denotes the rate that two predescribed
packet are not of the same flow. The active flow number N act , are shown as:
N act =

rhit + rmiss

rhit

rhit =

∑r p /C ； r

i =1

= ∑ ri (1 − pi ) / C
i =1

We calculate an estimate rhit for the hit frequency around the time of the arrival of
packet. (Let Hit(t) = 0 if no hit and Hit(t) = 1 if hit):
rhit (k ) = (1 − α )rhit (k − 1) + αHit (k )

with 0 < α < 1 , here α = 2.5 × 10−4 .
We use simple network topology with a single bottleneck link between r1 and r2 as
depicted in Figure 1. C is 3750pkt/s which corresponds to 15Mbps with an average
packet size of 500B. Connections are established between si and di. The propagation
delay ranges uniformly between 40ms and 220ms, our target queue length is 100
packets. r1 runs PI and supports ECN marking, while the other router runs Drop Tail,
buffer size is 800 packets.

In experiment 1, the number of FTP flows is 50 at the beginning, the total simulation lasted for 30s. As shown in the figure, the estimated value Nact can converge to
the real flow number.
In experiment 2, the number of FTP flows is 50 at the beginning, 50 FTP flows
join the link 20 seconds later, 50 FTP flows join the link when t=40s, 50 FTP flows
leave the link 30 seconds later, the total simulation lasted for 100s. As shown in the
experiment result, the estimated value Nact can converge to the real flow number, and
change with the real flow number n.

2.2 Estimating the Average Flow Delay

Using linearization techniques near equilibrium point of non-linear differential equation [3], ( W0 , q0 , p0 ) is the equilibrium point which meet

p is probability of packet mark/drop decided by AQM modules, we use the exponentially weighted moving average mark/drop probability as our p0 :
p0 (k ) = (1 − α ) p0 (k − 1) + αp
0 < α < 1 , here α = 2.5 × 10−5
We still use the network topology depicted in figure 1. In experiment 3, the propagation delay between the end and the router is 5ms, other settings are same as

experiment 1, so the propagation delay is 40ms, and the queueing delay is during
0~50ms.The number of FTP flows is 50 at the beginning, the total simulation lasted
for 150s. As shown in the figure, the estimated delay time is within the range of real
delay time.
In experiment 4, the propagation delay between the end and the router is 10ms,
other settings are same as experiment 3, so the propagation delay is 60ms, and the
queueing delay is during 0~50ms. As shown in the figure, the estimated delay time is
within the range of real delay time.

3 Conclusion
This paper describes a mechanism estimating flow Number and average delay in a
router in the Internet. This estimate is obtained without collecting or analyzing state
information on individual flows.
There are also some limits with the estimating mechanism. It will take a period of
time for the estimation to converge to the real value, this depends on the AQM
scheme deployed in the router. Sometimes the estimated values are smaller than reality: if all flows have the same rate, the value N act equals the real value n, otherwise,
the estimated number will be smaller; the estimated average delay will be smaller than
reality when nonresponsive flows exist. Suitable adjustment of the estimation value
need further attention.
