Abstract. The aim of the present paper is to propose a method of conditional
stochastic simulation of propagation of seismic wave using the spatiotemporal
correlation function. The method has been used to generate unknown time histories at various points of ground motion random filed based on the specified
earthquake record at one location. The results of the study show that the method
considered gives relatively low simulation errors.

1 Introduction
Simulation of spatiotemporal variation of earthquake field by the deterministic approach is very complex. It requires detailed knowledge of the fault size, rupture
mechanisms, propagation paths, distance from the epicentre, local geological and
topographical conditions. Therefore in earthquake engineering, the stochastic approach has been proved to be very useful and successfully applied in practice [4].
The incorporation of the seismic wave propagation effect is especially important
when large structures such as long bridges, dams, life-line systems and large buildings, are analyzed (see [3], for example). This is due to the fact that their dynamic
response can be significantly altered due to the spatial variations of ground motion
causing different seismic input acting on different supports of the structure. Detailed
analysis of the response of large structures often requires the generation of acceleration records for different locations of supports based on the specified record. This can
be achieved by applying the conditional stochastic modelling approach (see [1], [2]).
One of the problems of methods for random field simulation of ground motions
concerns the issue of identifying the time correlation of the field. This problem is
often simplified by the use of time-delay parameters, which are applied to shift earthquake records in time for different locations (see [2], [3]). It requires the specification
of direction of the seismic wave propagation, what is reasonable in the case of line
structures but may be problematic in other cases. Moreover, the simulation results
obtained in this way might depend on a value of the time step used in the analysis [2].
The aim of the present paper is to propose a method of conditional stochastic simulation of ground motions using the spatiotemporal correlation function. The method
has been used to generate unknown acceleration time histories at various field points
based on the specified earthquake record at one location.

2 Conditional Random Field Simulation Method
Let us define a correlation in space and time of the ground motion field by a spatiotemporal correlation function of the form (compare with [2]),

⎛ ω d rij
K rij , tij = σ 2 exp ⎜ −
⎜ 2πν d
⎝

(

)

⎞
⎟ exp − β Δtij ,
⎟
⎠

(

where σ is a standard deviation of the earthquake record, ω d is a predominant frequency of ground motion, rij is a distance between the field points i, j, ν is a mean
apparent seismic wave velocity in the field, d is a space scale parameter (d > 0) depending on local ground conditions, Δtij is a time lag between the values in the
ground motion records for the field points i, j and β is a time scale parameter
( β > 0) describing the degree of time correlation of the field. The scale parameters d
and β should be obtained experimentally based on the data concerning the seismic
wave propagation patterns in the ground. It should be mentioned, that defining the
correlation of the ground motion field by the use of the spatiotemporal correlation
function of Eq. (1) does not involve the necessity of specifying the direction of the
seismic wave propagation and of selecting the appropriate value of the time step in
the earthquake record.
In the random fields theory, the earthquake acceleration record is usually treated as
a set of measured values, which satisfy zero-mean Gaussian distribution. A formula
for the probability density of Gaussian conditional distribution can be written as [1],
f ( x y ) = ( det K c )

3 Numerical Example
In this paper, the example of numerical simulations of ground motion records at the
corners of a 100 m long and 50 m wide building has been presented. The method has
been used to generate time histories at 3 corners described by the coordinates: (0,50),
(100,50) and (100,0) based on a specified earthquake record at (0,0). In the analysis,
the generation of values at every time step is based on the known value at this time
