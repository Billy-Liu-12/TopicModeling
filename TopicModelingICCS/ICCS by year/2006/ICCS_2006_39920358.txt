Abstract. In this paper, we use the undetermined coeﬃcient method
to ﬁnd a desirable pair of cubic Bezier spirals and a desirable pair of
quintic PH spirals to generate planar G2 transition curve between two
separated circles. The G2 transition curve can be gotten by the rooting
formula, which simpliﬁes the computation, and the ratio of two radii has
no restriction, which extends the application area.

Introduction

Transition curves are useful for several Computer Graphics and CAD applications. They may be used for blending in the plane, i.e. to round corners, or
for smooth transition between two curves, usually two circular arcs. For some
applications, such as the design of highways, railways or robot trajectories, it
is desirable that the curvature varies monotonically with arc-length. So the research on G2 transition curve is important [1-3].
There have been some studies for the G2 transition curve when two circles
have diﬀerent positions. The Clothoid or Cornu spiral has traditionally been used
in highway design for many years [2,3], but it can not be represented exactly as
a NURBS curve, so it is not used easily in standard graphics packages. For two
tangent circles, Li and Meek [9] gave the smooth method of arc spline by a pair
of rational quadratic Bezier curves or one cubic Bezier curve. For two separated
circles, Walton and Meek [4,6] found a family of cubic Bezier spirals and used one
of them to construct the transition curve, but it requires the numerical method to
solve, and in order to make sure there is one solution, the ratio of two radii sometimes has some restriction. Walton and Meek [5,7] also found a family of quintic
PH spirals and used one of them to construct the transition curve, but it needs
the numerical computation, and the ratio of two radii has some limitation too.
In this paper, we give the improvement construction for G2 transition curve
between two separated circles. Based on the undetermined coeﬃcient method,
we ﬁnd a pair of cubic Bezier spirals and a pair of quintic PH curve spirals to
generate G2 transition curve. The advantage of improvement method is that

the transition curve can be gotten by the rooting formula, which simpliﬁes the
computation. And the ratio of two radii has no limitation, which extends the
application area. The improvement construction of G2 transition curve is more
convenient for applications in the ﬁelds of CAD and Computer Graphics.

G2 Transition Curve by a Pair of Cubic Bezier Spirals

The standard cubic Bezier curve can be written as
B(t) = (1 − t)3 B0 + 3t(1 − t)2 B1 + 3t2 (1 − t)B2 + t3 B3 , t ∈ [0, 1],
where B0 , B1 , B2 , B3 are control points of the cubic Bezier curve.
Denote h0 = ||B1 − B0 ||, h1 = ||B2 − B1 ||, h2 = ||B3 − B2 ||, θ is the angle from
B0 B1 to B1 B2 , φ is the angle form B1 B2 to B2 B3 . From R[8], we know when θ =
0, h1 = h0 , and h2 ≤ 65 h1 cos φ, the cubic Bezier curve is a spiral, the curvature
at one endpoint is zero, the curvature at another endpoint is a constant, the
curvature is monotone for t ∈ [0, 1]. Here, we denote h2 = 65 xh1 cos φ, where x
is a real number and 0 < x ≤ 1. Helped by the undetermined coeﬃcient method
to ﬁnd a desirable x, we can use the quadratic equation to get a pair of Bezier
spirals for planar G2 transition curve in S shape between two separated circles.
In this case, assume that two circles Ω0 , Ω1 centred at C0 , C1 with radius
r0 , r1 , r0 ≥ r1 , see Fig 1. We use a pair of Bezier spirals B0 (t), B1 (t) to construct
the G2 transition curve. Suppose B0 (0), B1 (0) are the joint of two spirals at
B(0), points B0 (1), B1 (1) connect two circles, T, N are the unit tangent vector
and the unit normal vector at the joint of two spirals, Ta , Tb are the unit tangent
vector at another endpoints of two curves, the angle from T to Tb and the angle
from Ta to T are both φ.

and use the geometry relation, we can obtain a quadratic equation

q(φ) = −||C1 − C0 ||2 cos φ2 − 8(r1 + r0 )2 cos φ + 9(r1 + r0 )2 .

We can guarantee there is the unique root of q(φ) = 0 when φ ∈ (0, π2 ). This
root can be obtained by the rooting formula of quadratic equation. At the same
time, since x = 59 < 1, the cubic Bezier curve is a spiral. And in the computation
process, we ﬁnd the ratio of two radii has no restriction.
Similarly, we can use a pair of cubic Bezier spirals to construct the G2 transition curve in C shape between two separated circles. The solution can also be
gotten by the rooting formula of quadratic equation and the ratio of two radii
has no restriction.

G2 Transition Curve by a Pair of Quintic PH Spirals

Consider the curve Q(t) = x(t)T0 + y(t)N0 and its derivative with respect to t,
where x(t) and y(t) are polynomials in t, T0 and N0 are two orthonormal vectors.
The curve Q(t) is said to be a PH curve if {x (t)}2 + {y (t)}2 can be expressed
as the square of a polynomial in t. To ensure Q(t) is indeed a PH curve, deﬁne
x (t) and y (t) as x (t) = U 2 (t) − V 2 (t) and y (t) = 2U (t)V (t), where U (t) V (t)
are polynomials. A PH quintic Bezier form of Q(t) is obtained by deﬁning U (t)
and V (t) as U (t) = i(1 − t)2 + 2jt(1 − t) + kt2 , V (t) = u(1 − t)2 + 2vt(1 − t) + wt2 .

From R[8], we know when u = v = 0, i = j, and i ≥ 4(1+cos

where x, y are real numbers, x ≥ 1, y > 0. Based on the undetermined coeﬃcient
method to ﬁnd the desirable x, y, we can use the rooting formula to construct
the G2 transition curve in C shape between two separated circles.

In this case, assume that two circles Ω0 , Ω1 centred at C0 , C1 with radius
r0 , r1 , r0 ≥ r1 , see Fig 2. We use a pair of quintic PH Spirals P0 (t), P1 (t) to
construct the transition curve. Suppose P0 (0), P1 (0) are the joint of two spirals
at P0 . Points P0 (1), P1 (1) connect two circles, T, N are the unit tangent vector
and the unit normal vector at P0 , points T0 , T1 are the unit tangent vector at

to T are both θ.

70x + 60.
we can guarantee that h(0) > 0, h( π2 ) < 0 and h (θ) < 0 for θ ∈ (0, π2 ). So
there is the unique real root of h(θ) = 0 when θ ∈ (0, π2 ). This root can be gotten
by the rooting formula of cubic equation. In the computation process, we ﬁnd
the ratio of two radii has no restriction.
For the G2 transition curve in S shape between two separated circles, we can
also use a pair of quintic PH spirals to construct the transition curve. It can be
gotten by the rooting formula of cubic equation and the ratio of two radii has
no restriction.
