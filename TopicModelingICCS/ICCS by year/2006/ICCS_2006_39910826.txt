Abstract. Chaos theory has been widely used in cryptography fields in recent
years and the performance of the pseudo stochastic sequence quantified from
chaos map has great influence on the efficiency and security of an encryption
system. In this paper, an improved stochastic middle multi-bits quantification
algorithm based on Chebyshev map is proposed to enhance the ability of anti
reconstruction a chaos system through reverse iteration and improve the
performance of the generated sequence under precision restricted condition.
The balance and correlation properties of the generated sequence are analyzed.
The sequence is proved to be a binary Bernoulli sequence and the distribution
of the differences between the amounts of 0 and 1 is analyzed. The side lobes of
auto correlation and values of cross correlation are proved to obey normal
distribution N (0, 1/N).

1 Introduction
Chaos theory has been widely used in encryption fields nowadays due to its initial
value sensitive, nonperiodic, unpredictable, and Gauss like statistical characteristics.
The raw generated analog chaotic sequence could not be directly used in digital system and the binary quantification process has a great influence on system security and
performance. The classic quantification method mainly has the following two disadvantages: (1) Only one bit can be generated per iteration, the computation load is very
heavy. For example, to encrypt a plaintext of 1MB size, we must iterate at least 8*220
times; (2) With the increasing of iteration, the generated raw sequence would be periodic because no processor is precision unrestricted. This will cause the quantified
sequence also being periodic and making the auto and cross correlation performance
worse [1]. Some scholars proposed a multi-bits quantification algorithm to reduce the
computation load and extend the period of the sequence by transforming the analog
value of each iteration to its binary form directly, but the security of this algorithm is
relatively weak, the analog sequence can be recovered from the quantified binary
sequence and the chaotic system can be reconstructed through reverse iteration [2]. In
this paper, an improved stochastic middle multi-bits quantification algorithm based on
Chebyshev map is proposed to strengthen the ability of anti reverse iteration and improve the performance of the generated sequence under precision restricted condition.

2 The Statistical Properties of Chebyshev Map
Chebyshev map is defined as:

xn +1 = cos(k cos −1 ( x n )) , x n ∈ [−1, 1] .

Let {xi} be chaotic sequence generated by Eq.1, we can get the following three properties based on Eq.2.

pseudo stochastic sequence.

3 Stochastic Middle Multi-bits Quantification Algorithm and Its
Performance Analysis
The stochastic middle multi-bits quantification algorithm is as follows:

④

Let k = 4, selecting a proper initial value x0, getting the real value xi from xi-1
by iterating Eq.1, xi ∈ [-1,1];
Let yi = (xi + 1), so yi ∈ [0,1];
Transform yi to binary form: (0.a1a2a3…an)2, ai=0 or 1, getting the multi-bits
a1a2a3…an, n is equal or less than the precision that the processor can provide;
Let yi' ∈ [0,1], whose decimal part is the reverse order of that of yi, as another
initial value, calculating the real value yi' from yi-1' by iterating Eq.1, yi' ∈ [0,1];

C. Fu et al.

Let the number of bits we want to get by each iteration be l (l < n),
m = ⎡( yi ' ) × (n − l )⎤ , m is a stochastic integer between 0 and (n - l) thus;
Skip first m bits of a1a2a3…an, getting the middle multi-bits am+1am+2…am+l.

The rest may be deduced by analogy, concatenating all the l bits generated by each
iterating together, thus getting the pseudo stochastic binary sequence with the length
we needed.
Because the position m is determined by chaotic map and also stochastic, the algorithm not only has the advantages such as reducing the computation load by generating l
bits per iteration and extending the period of the sequence under precision restricted
condition that the original multi-bits algorithm has, but also further strengthen the ability
of anti reconstruction of the chaos system. The balance and correlation performance are
the two most import properties of stochastic sequence, which greatly affects the security
and key space of an encryption system, and will be analyzed in the following.
Lemma 1. The pseudo stochastic sequence generated by stochastic middle multi-bits
algorithm is a binary Bernoulli distributed sequence. For sequence with length N, the
mean of the differences is 0 and the variance is N.
Lemma 2. For any two different sequence {xi1} and {xi2} that generated by stochastic
middle multi-bits algorithm, they satisfy: When N is large enough and m is relatively
small, the side lobes of auto correlation and values of cross correlation obey normal
distribution N (0, 1/N).

The simulation result of balance property is shown in Fig. 1(a). 1000 sequences
with length N=8192 are generated and the initial values are selected independently.
The mean of differences is -0.9480 and the standard deviation is 92.3074, which are
in good accordance with theoretical value 0 and 90.5097. The simulation results of the
auto and cross correlation functions and the distribution of cross correlation values are
shown in Fig. 1(b) to (d). The sequence length is 8192 and the initial values are selected as 0.60000 and 0.60001 for verify the initial value sensitive property of a chaotic system. The maximum absolute value of auto correlation side lobe is 0.0410 and
the value of cross correlation is 0.0905, which are in good accordance with theoretical
value 0. Above analysis indicate that the quantified sequences have excellent balance
and auto/cross correlation performance.

4 Experimental Results and Conclusions
The comparison of different quantification algorithms is shown in Table 1. The plaintext to be encrypted is 1MB size and parameter l is set to 8. From Table 1 we can see,
the efficiency and the sequence performance of the stochastic middle multi-bits quantification algorithm is far better than that of classic binary quantification algorithm.
While compared with the multi-bits algorithm, although the encryption time is longer
due to it’s more complicated algorithm, but the security is high due to its powerful
anti reconstruction ability. The algorithm proposed in this paper can be widely used in
signal generators for generating high quality PN sequence [4], which can also be used
in communication channel simulation, spread spectrum communication, etc.
