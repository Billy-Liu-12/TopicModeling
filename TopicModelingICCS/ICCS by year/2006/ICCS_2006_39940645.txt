Abstract. In this paper, we firstly propose an on-chip bus power consumption
model, which includes the self transition power dissipated on the signal lines
and the coupled transition power dissipated between every two signal lines.
And then a new heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine a physical order of
signal lines in bus. Experimental results show an average power saving 26.85%.

1 Introduction
With the advent of portable and high density micro-electronic devices such as the
laptop personal computer and wireless communication equipment, power consumption of very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits has become a critical concern [1].
Further ultra-deep submicron (UDSM) VLSI and system-on-chip have resulted in a
considerable portion of power dissipated on buses, especially in communication and
multi- media applications, a large fraction of power is consumed during accessing
memory and data transfer. So we must consider low power optimization on the interconnected buses.
Because of the UDSM, the major sources of power consumption in buses are the
self transition activities and the coupled activities of the lines of each bus [1]. The
traditional power model P = α CLV 2 T is no longer valid [2,3]. The main research in
this paper is to minimize the self transition activities and the coupled transition activities of on-chip buses.
There are many researches who have addressed the problem of minimizing power
on buses. Reference [4] proposed a bus-binding method for minimizing transitions
activities by integrating the scheduling results, but this approach only minimizes the
self transition activities. Reference [5] proposed a method to determine a relative
placement order of bus line to reduce the coupled transition activities, but it only
minimize the coupled transition activities of adjacent bit-lines and neglect the coupled
transition activities of nonadjacent signal lines. Reference [6,7] proposed an approach
of combing wire swapping and spacing to minimize the coupled transition activities,
but it neglects the self transition activities. Reference [8,9] proposed different encoding scheme to minimize the coupled transition activity, which need additional encode
and decode circuits and thus increases the hardware overhead. Reference [1] proposed

a high-level interconnection synthesis algorithm which bind the data transfer to buses
and determine the physical order of signal lines in each bus, the algorithm minimizes
the self transition activities and the coupled transition activities on buses, but the
coupled transition activities between the nonadjacent signal lines are neglected.
In this paper, we propose a on-chip buses power consumption model which involves
both the self transition activities and the coupled transition activities between every
two signal lines, and then a new heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine the
physical order of signal lines of bus to minimize the weight of the transition activities.
There is no additional hardware overhead during the whole optimization process.

2 Power Model
In the UDSM VLSI, the dynamic consumption on interconnect buses include not only
the self transition activities on single line, but also the coupled transition activities on
adjacent and nonadjacent two single lines as shown in figure 1 [2,3].

2.1 Self Transition Power
As shown in figure 2, there are three types of transitions on single line. In type 1, the
signal transits from low to high. In type 2, the signal transits from high to low. In type
3, no signal transits on the line. Type 1 transition will generate power consumption,
which is a valid transition. We can conclude the following theorem.
Theorem 1: At t clock step, the valid self transition number of the signal line i on
bus K can be expressed as follow

Where CS and C L are self capacitance on signal line i , V dd is the voltage.
2.2 Coupled Transition Power

As shown in figure 1, in UDSM VLSI every two signal lines can generate coupled
capacitance and then generate coupled transition power. As shown in figure 3, there
are five transition types between two signal lines. In type 1, no signal transitions occur on either line. In type 2, both signals make transitions to the same states. In type 3,
exactly one of the two signals makes a transition and finally the two signals have the
same states. In type 4, exactly one of the two signals makes a transition and finally the
two signals have different states. In type 5, one signal transits from low to high and
another from high to low. Among these five types, type 1,2,3 will not generate dynamic charge on couple capacitance and thus no dynamic power consumption. Type 4
and 5 generate dynamic consumption and also the charge generated by type 5 is two
times as much as type 4. Type 4 transition is a valid transition. We can conclude following theorem.

lines on bus K can be expressed as follow

3 Optimized for Low Power
In section 2, from (7) and (8), it can be concluded that minimizing P KT is equivalent to
minimizing Z TK ; and from (10), the bus transition weight can be obtained, if the physical order of signal lines on the bus can be adjusted, minimum Z TK can be obtained. A
heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine a physical order of signal lines in bus.
The input to the algorithm is an initial order setΨof signal lines (the elements in
Ψcorrespond to each signal line in the bus) and the coupled-transition weight of the
adjacent signal lines, The output is the adjusted physical order set of signal lines
given by the algorithm is shown in algorithm 1.
The algorithm is divided into two parts, the first part is decomposing as shown in
algorithm 2, the elements inΨm,n are classified into three parts, for the signal lines
which have smaller coupled- transition weight than others (hence larger p(vi)), put the
elements into the middle of the order, that is in set m,3n-1 for the signal lines which
have bigger coupled-transition weight with others, put the corresponding elements
into the two sides of the order, that is in m,3n-2 ndΨm,3n respectively, until the number of elements in leaf nodes sets of tree T is no more than 3 ; the second part is arranging as shown in algorithm 3, from the deepest leaf node, incorporate other leaf
nodes to their father node at the same time make the expense smallest, and delete the
leaf nodes, until there is only one root node. We can obtain a sorted set whose order is
the result.

4 Experimental Results

Ⅳ

The algorithm in section 3 is implemented in C++ and is executed on a Pentium
computer with clock speed of 1.7GHz. During the experiment, we test some Benchmark Circuits. First using some random data to simulate, then obtain the profile of
these data, which is input to our algorithm and obtain the results of the experiment.
Among the Benchmark Circuits, DIFFEQ is to solve a particular differential equation; GCD is to compute the greatest-common-divisor of two numbers; KALMAN is
an implementation of the Kalman filter.
We use this algorithm to test every Benchmark Circuits two times, and each time
β = 3, 4 and λ i− j = 1 i − j . The experiment result is in table 1, the third column is the
result of simulation without using our algorithm and the fourth column is the result of
executing our algorithm. From table 1, we can see that a reduction in on-chip power
consumption of an average of 26.85% can be had by utilizing the heuristic algorithm.
