Abstract. Binding energy spectra and orbital momentum distributions of the
two most stable conformers of L-alanine are investigated. Molecular properties
such as geometry and dipole moments agree well with available experimental
and previous theoretical investigations. Dual space analysis is employed to
study the binding energy spectra in coordinate space based on B3LYP/TZVP
density functional calculations, and the valence orbital momentum distributions
based on the plane wave impulse approximation. In the valence space, the
HOMO (24a), NHOMO (23a) and orbitals 22a and 18a are selected to study
the conformational processes in L-alanine.

1 Introduction
The behaviour of proteins in biological systems at the molecular level is an important
area of research, since many biological phenomena can be traced to fundamental
properties of the molecular constituents. The native structures of proteins are largely
governed by the balance of interactions among the different amino acid residues.
Understanding the biological specificity of these species therefore requires insight
into the dynamics of amino acids (NH2-CH(R)-COOH). The functionality of amino
acids varies depending on their conformation [1], which is important in protein stability and three dimensional folding [2]. Therefore, analysis of structural and chemical
properties of amino acids under isolated conditions is of great importance.
Alanine (R=CH3) is an important prototype for all chiral amino acids, due to its
relatively simple structure. In the body, it has a major role in transferring nitrogen
from tissue sites to the liver [3]. The conformational behaviour of L-alanine, like
glycine [4], has brought many challenges to experimental and theoretical investigations. Up to 13 conformations were predicted from sophisticated ab initio calculations
[5, 6], several of which were observed experimentally using the millimetre wave
(MMW) spectrum of alanine [7] and gas-phase electron diffraction (GED) techniques
[8]. The relative stability of these conformers is dependant upon the interplay of various intramolecular hydrogen bonds and electron correlation, as demonstrated for
small aliphatic amino acids [4, 6, 9].
In position space, the conformational processes of L-alanine has been investigated,
using both DFT and ab initio methods [6]. Molecular properties, such as geometries,
relative energies and dipole moments have all been effectively predicted using similar

models [5, 6]. The two lowest energy conformations for L-alanine, I and II, are presented in Fig. 1. Details however regarding the redistribution of electron density and
orbital distortion, as a result of these processes, are lacking. This study therefore aims
to provide an orbital-based insight into the bonding environment within L-alanine.
We focus on information that differentiates the conformers, such as dipole moments
and orbital momentum distributions (MDs), using dual space analysis (DSA) [10].
Conformational variations will be discussed in relation to rotations about the C(3)-O,
C(3)-Cα and Cα-N bonds, in order to provide an orbital dependant representation of the
bonding mechanisms within the two conformations.

2 Methods and Computational Details
Density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP methodology, together with the triple zeta
valence polarized (TZVP) basis set [11] was employed for geometry optimization
calculations. Electronic structural calculations undertaken in this study used the computational chemistry package of GAUSSIAN03 [12].
Molecular wave functions obtained from single point calculations (B3LYP/
TZVP//B3LYP/TZVP) were Fourier transformed into k-space as momentum distributions (MDs, σ). Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, independent particle
approximation and the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) [13] gives,

σ ∝ dΩ ⎟ ψj (k)⎟2

(1)

The integral dΩ performs the spherical averaging over the initial rotational states,
while σ is proportional to the squared momentum space one-electron Dyson orbitals
ψj (k). The azimuthal angle φ has a defined relationship with momentum [13].

populated conformation (~8:1 ratio in favour of I) is produced by three rotations of
the C(3)-Cα, C(3)-O and Cα-N bonds in conformer I. Selected geometric parameters for
these conformations based on the B3LYP/TZVP model are given in Table 1.
The predicted properties for both conformations agree well with previous experimental and theoretical results. All bond lengths lie within 0.02Å of the experiment,
whilst most angular deviations were less than 3°. The exception however is in the
description of the ∠HOC angle in I. The B3LYP/TZVP model predicted this angle to
be 107°, which is 5.3° smaller than the experimental value of 112.3°. A similar deviation was observed by Császár [6] (decrease of 6.1°) when using the MP2/6-311++G**
method.

In table 1, rotations around the single bonds do not exhibit impact on bond lengths;
small angle variations are however observed and apparent changes in dihedral angles
exist to accommodate the rotations. This is highlighted by the elongation of the Cα-N
bond (0.02Å) and the reduction in the ∠C(3)CαN angle (4°) in II, resulting from the
weak OH···NH2 interaction (H···N distance is 1.899 Å). The results obtained in this
study agree well with both experimental and previous theoretical calculations.
3.2 Conformational Impact on Stability and Molecular Properties
A number of important molecular properties using DFT [6, 14] and ab initio calculations [1, 6] are provided in Table 1 for comparison. With the inclusion of zero-point
energy (ZPE), the present method predicts conformer II to lie within 0.20 kcal·mol-1
of I. This is in satisfactory agreement with the values of 0.14 and 0.39 kcal·mol-1
given by the MP2/6-311++G** and B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ [14] (ZPE included) models, respectively.
Properties such as dipole moments are also included in this table as biomolecular
conformers that differ by small energies can exhibit profound differences in their
anisotropic properties [4], affecting their chemical reactivity. The C(3)-Cα, Cα-N and
C(3)-O bond rotations in I cause the total dipole moment to increase significantly from
1.31 D to 5.64 D, which agrees well with the experimental values of 1.80 D (I) and
5.13 D (II) [9] and the values of 1.41 D and 5.45 D generated using the MP2/6311++G** model [1]. Such changes indicate that significant charge redistribution is
associated with these rotations. This is also evident as µ x and µ y have altered considerably as a result of these rotations. For example, µ x of I is 0.72 D and becomes -5.43
D in conformer II, whilst µ z varies significantly without any changes in sign. This
trend was observed in glycine [4].

3.3 Molecular Orbital Information in Coordinate Space
In their ground electronic states, conformers I and II (X1A) of L-alanine are both
closed shells with singlet states, which have 24 doubly occupied molecular orbitals
(MOs). The associated orbital energies for these conformations are given in Fig. 2.
From this figure it is clear the three combined bond rotations in I cause major energy
variations in orbitals 14a, 19a, 22a and 23a, whilst visible changes to orbitals 13a,
16a, 18a and 24a are observed. From information provided thus far it is still unclear
as to the changes in the nature of bonding from these rotations. This will be explored
in more detail in the next sections using information from momentum space.
3.4 Orbital MDs of L-Alanine in Valence Space
Orbital momentum distributions (MDs) of L-alanine in the outer valence space have
been calculated in the present study. Both conformations belong to the C1 point group
symmetry and their Dyson orbitals are therefore correlated. Four representative orbitals
were selected to demonstrate interesting structural information of L-alanine (Fig. 3).
Orbitals of other conformers which exhibit the most significant variation with respect
to the global minimum structure of L-alanine are considered to be the fingerprints of
rotation around a particular bond.
In Figure 3(a), orbital MDs related to MO 24a (HOMO) indicate significant mixed
‘s-like’ and ‘p-like’ characteristics in both conformations. The associated charge distributions of the Dyson orbital reveal that in I these contributions are predominately
from the lone-pair on the N atom and N-H bonds of the amino group. The rotations
enhance contributions on the lone-pair of the O in O=C(3),, whilst reducing the charge
density on the amino group. The latter reduces the orbital density of H atoms in the –
NH2 group, causing the momentum distributions to drop in the low momentum region. This may have significant implications in the chemical reactivity of these conformers as any structural manipulation, i.e., bond breaking or bond formation occurs
within these frontier orbitals.
In MO 23a (NHOMO), the nature of bonding in the two conformations are essentially reversed. That is, the p-like contributions in I are primarily from the lone pair on
O of O=C(3), whereas in conformer II the contributions stem from the amino group
[Fig. 3(b)]. Sizeable s-contributions are also present along the Cα-N bond, contributing to the enhancement of the orbital MDs in the region of low momentum. This
demonstrates that orbital MDs can serve as a quantitative property in the identification of electron redistribution. Similar trends to the HOMOs and NHOMOs were
observed in the glycine conformers [4], where rotation of the C(3)-Cα and Cα-N bonds
were shown to cause the most perturbation to the orbitals in this region.
In contrast, MO 22a in Fig. 3(c) demonstrates that the electron charge distributions
concentrating in the HO-C=O region in I did not change with the single bond rotations, even with the rotation of the HO-C bond. A small enhancement of charge density on the NH2 group in II causes the small shift of orbital MDs towards the low
momentum region, as indicated in Fig 3(c). In both conformations, this MO is clearly
a π-bond with the nodal plane being the molecular plane, which is formed by the nonhydrogen atoms (excluding the methyl group). These orbitals are related to the antisymmetric orbitals of a'' symmetry found in glycine [4, 15].

In comparison to MOs 24a and 23a (Fig 3 (a) and (b)), where the discrepancies in
the momentum distributions occur at zero momentum due to the hydrogen 1s AO
contributions, orbital 18a in I and II differ in the region of medium momentum at
approximately φ = 10° (Fig. 3(d)). This orbital correlates to orbital 14a' in glycine [4],
which was shown to be the fingerprint orbital for all single bond rotations. In MO
18a, rotation of C(3)-O in I caused the strong delocalised coverage along the H-O-C(3)Cα framework to break into more isolated groups of H-O-C(3), C(3)=O and C(3)-Cα-C(1).
These changes are reflected in the associated orbital MDs in Fig. 3(d).

4 Conclusion
Rotational processes of the two lowest energy conformers of L-alanine (XA) have
been studied using dual space analysis (DSA). Changes to the geometric parameters
after the C(3)-Cα, Cα-N and C(3)-O bond rotations in the global minimum (I) largely
resulted from the related dihedral angles reflecting the rotations. Weak interactions,
such as O-H····NH2 also contribute to the changes in structure. Between the two conformations, redistribution of the electron charge density was also found to vary significantly in certain orbitals.

Variations in both binding energy spectra and orbital momentum distributions in
L-alanine were observed as a result of the rotations. Orbitals exhibiting significant
changes in binding energy however did not necessarily vary significantly in the shape
of their electron density (orbital MDs) and vice versa. While the HOMO (24a) and
orbital 18a did not exhibit major changes in their binding energies with respect to
their conformations, however these orbitals experienced significant variations in their
electron density, as reflected by their orbital MDs. Orbital 22a receives significant
changes in binding energy but its electron density does not vary much with respect to
conformation. Using dual space analysis, this investigation therefore provides a
unique insight into the structural effects of alanine upon rotation.
