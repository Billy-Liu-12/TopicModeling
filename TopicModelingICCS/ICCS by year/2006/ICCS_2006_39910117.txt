Abstract. In this paper we study the symmetry of Runge-Kutta methods with higher derivatives. We ﬁnd conditions which provide this property for the above numerical methods. We prove that the family of
E-methods constructed earlier consists of symmetric methods only, which
lead to the quadratic extrapolation technique in practice.

Introduction

Here, we study Runge-Kutta methods with higher derivatives applied to ordinary
diﬀerential equations (ODEs) of the form
x (t) = g t, x(t) ,

t ∈ [t0 , t0 + T ],

x(t0 ) = x0

(1)

where x(t) ∈ Rn and g : D ⊂ Rn+1 → Rn is a suﬃciently smooth function. We
remark that these numerical methods proved their eﬃciency. So, there are many
papers published in this ﬁeld (see [2], [3], [5], [7], [8], [11], [12], [13] and so on).
All methods of such sort can be represented as follows:
l

pj
(r)

τkr aij g (r) (tkj , xkj ),

xki = xk + τk

i = 1, 2, . . . , l,

(r)

τkr bj g (r) (tkj , xkj ),

xk+1 = xk + τk

k = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1,

(2b)

def

where x0 = x0 , tkj = tk + cj τk , g (r) (tkj , xkj ) denotes the r-th derivative1 of the
right-hand side of problem (1) with respect to t evaluated at the point (tkj , xkj ),

(r)

the coeﬃcients aij , bj and cj , i, j = 1, 2, . . . , l, r = 0, 1, . . . , pj are real numbers
(cj ∈ [0, 1]), and τk is a step size which may be ﬁxed or variable. In general, the
numbers pj of the used derivatives are not equal.
When method (2) is implicit the important task is its correct implementation.
In this case, we have to involve an additional iterative scheme and to keep a
suﬃcient number of iteration steps, as indicated in [11], [12], in order to ensure
high order convergence rate.
Here, we investigate the symmetry property of method (2). We ﬁnd the con(r)
(r)
ditions on the coeﬃcients aij , bj and cj which guarantee that method (2) is
symmetric. For example, these conditions are used to prove the symmetry of
E-methods developed in [11], [12]. Actually, the present study extends the results given in [4], [9] and [10] to the class of Runge-Kutta methods with higher
derivatives. We just want to emphasize that symmetric numerical methods are of
great importance when applied to reversible problems (see [6]) or when used as
underlying methods in extrapolation algorithms (see the cited papers). However,
we restrict ourselves to the quadratic extrapolation issue only in this paper.

Symmetric Runge-Kutta Methods with Higher
Derivatives

It is clear that any particular Runge-Kutta method (2) with higher derivatives
(r)
(r)
is determined uniquely by the set of coeﬃcients aij , bj and cj . Therefore,
following Butcher’s idea (see, for example, [1] or [4]), we represent method (2)
by a partitioned tableau of the form

containing all the coeﬃcients of a Runge-Kutta method with higher derivatives.
(r)
The matrix A, consisting of the coeﬃcients aij , is a real matrix of dimension
l × (p1 + p2 + . . . + pl )l, and the other coeﬃcients form the real vectors b and c
of dimensions (p1 + p2 + . . . + pl )l and l, respectively, in tableau (3).
It is known that symmetric one-step methods are deﬁned via their adjoint
counterparts, as explained, for example, in [4, p. 219–222] or in [9]. Therefore
our task now is to extend the appropriate results derived for coeﬃcients of adjoint
Runge-Kutta methods to the case of method (2) involving higher derivatives.
So, we start with
Theorem 1. Let method (2) be an l-stage Runge-Kutta formula with higher
derivatives, whose coeﬃcients are given by tableau (3). Then its adjoint method

Symmetric Runge-Kutta Methods with Higher Derivatives

is equivalent to an l-stage Runge-Kutta formula with higher derivatives of the
(r)−
(r)−
form (2) whose coeﬃcients aij , bj
and c−
j satisfy

(r)

= (−1)r bl+1−j , r = 0, 1, . . . , pj , i, j = 1, 2, . . . , l.

bj

(4c)

Proof. It is well-known (see the cited papers) that in order to ﬁnd the adjoint
Runge-Kutta method with higher derivatives we have to interchange the pair
(tk , xk ) with the pair (tk+1 , xk+1 ) and to replace τ with −τ in the increment
function of the method (2). It follows from the fact that method (2) belongs to
the class of one-step methods.
Having fulﬁlled this transformation we arrive at an l-stage Runge-Kutta
method of the form
pj

l

(r)

(r)

(−1)r τkr bj − aij g (r) (tkj , xkj ),

xki = xk + τk

(5b)

j=1 r=0
l

pj
(r)

(−1)r τkr bj g (r) (tkj , xkj ),

xk+1 = xk + τk
j=1 r=0

where tkj = tk + (1 − cj )τk . If we now rearrange the nodes c−
i = 1 − cl+1−i of
method (5) to make them increasing; i.e., rearrange indexes by the rule i ←→
l + 1 − i and j ←→ l + 1 − j we will yield the conventional Runge-Kutta method
(r)−
(r)−
with higher derivatives of the form (2) whose coeﬃcients aij , bj
and c−
j
satisfy formulas (4). The theorem is proved.
Papers [4, p. 219–222], [9] deﬁne a symmetric one-step method to be a method
whose increment function coincides with the increment function of its adjoint
method. Thus, Theorem 1 says that it is suﬃcient to require the following equalities:
(6a)
cj = 1 − cl+1−j ,
(r)

(r)

(r)

aij = (−1)r bl+1−j − al+1−i,l+1−j ,
(r)

bj

(r)

= (−1)r bl+1−j , r = 0, 1, . . . , pj , i, j = 1, 2, . . . , l.

(6b)
(6c)

Note that formulas (6) will be necessary for the symmetry if method (2) is
irreducible (see [14]). It is also important to understand that conditions (6b),
(6c) imply
(7)
pj = pl+1−j , j = 1, 2, . . . , l;
i.e., equality (7) is required for any symmetric irreducible Runge-Kutta method
with higher derivatives.
Our next goal is to show that symmetric irreducible Runge-Kutta methods of
the form (2) do exist.

Symmetry of E-Methods with Higher Derivatives

To approach this, we refer to the family of Runge-Kutta methods with higher
derivatives constructed by the collocation technique with multiple nodes (see
[11], [12]). They have been called E-methods with higher derivatives and are of
the form

where gk+i = g (r) (tk+i , xk+i ), i = 0, 1/2, 1, and p is the number of derivatives
of the right-hand side of problem (1) used to compute the numerical solution.
Evidently, method (8) belongs to the class of Runge-Kutta methods with higher
derivatives, and its coeﬃcients form the tableau

It was proven in [12] that method (8) with the coeﬃcients calculated by
formulas (10) is A-stable for any p. Thus, the E-methods with higher derivatives
are a good means for a practical implementation when diﬀerentiation of the
right-hand side of ODE (1) is not too complicated. Now we prove the symmetry
of method (8).

Theorem 2. E-method (8) with coeﬃcients (10) is symmetric for any integer
p ≥ 0.
Proof. To prove this theorem, it is suﬃcient to check the symmetry conditions
(6), (7) for the coeﬃcients in tableau (9) satisfying formulas (10) (see Section 2).
It is obvious that (6a) and (7) hold. Then, by calculating the right-hand side of
formula (6b) applied to the method (8) and using (10d), we obtain the following:
(r)

(r)

= (−1)r (−1)r a1 + a3 − a3

The condition (6b) also holds. In the same way, we easily check the last condition
(6c). Theorem 2 is proved.
Next, we conﬁrm this theoretical result with the numerical examples below
which show that method (8) with coeﬃcients (10) provide quadratic extrapolation for diﬀerent values of the parameter p. We refer the reader to [4], [10] for
particulars of quadratic extrapolation.

Quadratic Extrapolation

First, we apply formulas (10) to calculate coeﬃcients of the following E-methods
of orders 6 and 8, respectively; i.e., when p = 1 and p = 2:
xk+1/2 = xk+

Our aim in this section is to check that E-methods (11) and (12) are symmetric
and, in fact, provide quadratic extrapolation in practice. To do this, we perform
numerical integrations of problem (13) with 5 diﬀerent ﬁxed step sizes τk = τ
on the interval [0, 3], as indicated in Tables 1 and 2. We use these methods
without extrapolation (q = 0), with one extrapolation step (q = 1) and with two
extrapolations (q = 2) as well. However, the underlying methods are implicit.
Therefore we apply the Newton iteration with the trivial predictor in order to
obtain the required numerical solution and keep the number of iteration steps
per grid point high enough to ensure that the extrapolation works properly (see
[10] for more detail). We choose integers 1,2,3 and so on as the extrapolation
sequence. The exact solution mentioned above is used to calculate the global
errors of the integrations in the sup-norm and, hence, to ﬁnd the actual order of
the extrapolation algorithms.
Tables 1 and 2 exhibit clearly that the quadratic extrapolation deﬁnitely works
with E-methods (11) and (12); i.e., each step of the extrapolation algorithm raises
the accuracy of the underlying method by two orders. This experiment conﬁrms
also that both E-methods are symmetric and the theoretical results given above
are correct.

Conclusion

In this paper we have discussed the symmetry property of Runge-Kutta methods
with higher derivatives. We have found the coeﬃcients of adjoint Runge-Kutta
methods with higher derivatives (Theorem 1) and determined the general conditions on the coeﬃcients of the methods under consideration to be symmetric
(formulas (6), (7)). The new result is an extension of the well-known formulas for
conventional Runge-Kutta methods (see the cited papers) and, of course, covers this case. Finally, we have given some examples of symmetric Runge-Kutta

methods with higher derivatives and conﬁrmed this property with practical computations. From this point of view, the family of E-methods derived earlier in
[11] and [12] looks attractive if the cost of the derivative calculation is not too
high. However, more experiments are needed to identify practical properties of
the E-methods in detail.
