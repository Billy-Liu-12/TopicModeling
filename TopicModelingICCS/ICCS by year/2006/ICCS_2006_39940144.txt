Abstract. Routers have the ability to output statistics about packets
and ﬂows of packets that traverse them. Since however the generation of
detailed traﬃc statistics does not scale well with link speed, increasingly
passive traﬃc measurement employs sampling at the packet level. Packet
sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure ﬂow
data on high-speed links. However, knowing the number and length of the
original ﬂows is necessary for some applications. This paper provides an
algorithm that uses ﬂow statistics formed from sampled packet stream
to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths of ﬂows in the unsampled
stream. We achieve this through statistical inference and by exploiting
heavy-tailed feather. We also investigate the impact on our results of
diﬀerent packet sampling rate. The experiment results show the inferred
distributions are accurate in most cases.

Introduction

With the rapid increase of network link speed, packet sampling has become
an attractive and scalable means to measure ﬂow data. However, knowing the
number and lengths of the unsampled ﬂows remains useful for characterizing
traﬃc and the resources required to accommodate its demands. Here are some
applications: Resources Required for Collecting Flow Statistics: ﬂow cache utilization and the bandwidth for processing and transmitting ﬂow statistics are
sensitive to the sampling rate, the number of ﬂows, and ﬂow lengths and duration; see [1,2]. Characterizing Source Traﬃc: the measured numbers of ﬂows
and the distribution of their lengths have been used to evaluate gains in deployment of web proxies [3], and to determine thresholds for setting up connections
in ﬂow-switched networks [4]. Sampling entails an inherent loss of information.
We expect use statistic inference to recover information as much as possible.
However, more detailed characteristics of the original traﬃc are not so easily
estimated. Quantities of interest include the number of packets in the ﬂow–we
shall refer to this as the ﬂow length–and the number of ﬂows with ﬁxed length.

distribution in [6]. Its disadvantage is that all packet must be processed due to
not using sampling. Hohn and Veitch in [7] discussed the inaccuracy of estimating
ﬂow distribution from sampled traﬃc, when the sampling is performed at the
packet level.
Although sampled traﬃc statistics are increasingly being used for network
measurements, to our knowledge few studies have addressed the problem of
estimating ﬂow size distribution from the sampled packet stream. In [2], the
authors studied the statistical properties of packet-level sampling using realworld Internet traﬃc traces. This is followed by [8] in which the ﬂow distribution
is inferred from the sampled statistics. After showing that the naive scaling of the
ﬂow distribution estimated from the sampled traﬃc is in general not accurate,
the authors propose an EM algorithm to iteratively compute a more accurate
estimation. Scaling method is simple, but it exploits the sampling properties of
SYN ﬂows to estimate TCP ﬂow frequencies; EM algorithm does not rely on
the properties of SYN ﬂows and hence is not restricted to TCP traﬃc, but its
versatility comes at the cost of computational complexity.
1.2

Some Elementary Concepts

This paper considers sampling some target proportion p = 1/N of the packet
stream. There are a number of diﬀerent ways to implement this. Implementations
include independent sampling of packets with probability p = 1/N , and periodic
selection of every N th packet from the full packet stream. In both cases we
will call N the sampling period, i.e., the reciprocal of the average sampling
rate. Although the length distributions by random and periodic sampling can be
distinguished, the diﬀerences are, in fact, suﬃciently small [8]. A ﬂow is deﬁned
as a stream of packets subject to ﬂow speciﬁcation and timeout. When a packet
arrives, the speciﬁc rules of ﬂow speciﬁcation determine which active ﬂow this
packet belongs to, or if no active ﬂow is found that matches the description
of this packet, a new ﬂow is created. A TCP ﬂow is a stream of TCP packets
subject to timeout and having the same source and destination IP addresses,
same source and destination port numbers. Similarly, a UDP ﬂow is a stream
of UDP packets associated with above speciﬁcation. A general ﬂow is a stream
of packets subject to timeout and having the same source and destination IP
addresses, same source and destination port numbers(not considering protocol).
In this paper, we will use the term original ﬂow to describe the above ﬂow. A
sampled ﬂow is deﬁned as a stream of packets that are sampled at probability
p = 1/N from an original ﬂow.

Contribution and Outline

This paper presents a novel algorithm for estimation of ﬂow size distributions
from sampled ﬂow statistics. Our method is available not only to TCP ﬂows but
also to general ﬂows. We complete this work using four approaches. The ﬁrst
formalizes the probability distribution of original ﬂow length of a sampled ﬂow
length j. The second classiﬁes two types of ﬂows based on their probability that

146

no packet is sampled. A ﬂow is labeled as small (S) when it’s probability that no
packet is sampled is more than ε and as large (L) when it’s probability that no
packet is sampled is less than or equal to ε. The third gives a simple estimation
method for large ﬂows. The fourth uses maximum likelihood estimation and EM
algorithm to estimate the full distribution of small ﬂows.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we analyze the
probability models of the original ﬂow length distributions of a sampled ﬂow
under the assumptions of Pareto distributions. In Section 3, we classify two
types of ﬂows: small ﬂow and large ﬂow. Then we present diﬀerent estimation
methods for small ﬂows and large ﬂows, respectively. In Section 4 we discuss the
computational complexity of our method. Furthermore, we compare our method
with EM algorithm in estimation accuracy and computational complexity. We
conclude in Section 5.

Probability Distribution of Original Flow Length

For a speciﬁc original ﬂow F , let XF denote the number of packets in F ,
YF denote the number of packets in the sampled ﬂow from F . The conditional distribution of YF , given that XF = l, follows a binomial distribution
l
P r[YF = k|XF = l] = Bp (l, k) =
pk (1 − p)l−k . By the conditional probak
bility formula,
P r[XF = x|YF = y] =

P r[YF = y|XF = x]P r[XF = x]
P r[YF = y]

(1)

and by the complete probability formula,
∞

P r[YF = y] =

Bp (i, y)P r[XF = i]

(2)

i=y

We know that ﬂow length distributions have the property of being heavy-tailed.
Pareto distribution is the simplest heavy-tailed distribution; its probability mass
function is
P r[XF = x] = βαβ /xβ+1 , α, β > 0, x ≥ α
(3)
where β is called Pareto parameter. Hence Equation (2) can be written as:
∞

Bp (i, y)βαβ /iβ+1 , y ≥ α

P r[YF = y] =
i=y

Lemma 1. Under the assumption that original ﬂow lengths satisfy Pareto distribution, the probability that a sampled ﬂow of length y(≥ α) is sampled from
an original ﬂow of length x is
P r[XF = x|YF = y] =

Bp (x, y)/xβ+1
∞
i=y

Bp (i, y)βαβ /iβ+1

.

To describe the properties of the above probability, apply diﬀerent values of
p and β to calculate the probability of Lemma 1. And for ﬁxed p and β, for
each y(≥ α), we ﬁnd x such that the above probability P r[XF = x|YF = y] is
maximized. We have
Lemma 2. Under the assumption of Lemma 1, for ﬁxed p = 1/N, β and y(≥ α),
the probability P r[XF = x|YF = y] is maximized at x = N y − n(p, β). It is
increasing as x increases for x < N y − n(p, β) and decreasing as x increases for
x > N y − n(p, β).
Here n(p, β) is a binary function with variables p and β whose value domain is
integer set. Function n(p, β) has the following properties:
1) It is a monotone decreasing function on variable p, that is , for ﬁxed β, is
decreasing as p increases.
2) It is a monotone increasing function on variable β, that is , for ﬁxed p, is
increasing as β increases.
For example, n(0.1, 0.5) = 14, n(0.1, 1.0) = 18, n(0.1, 1.5) = 23. In the concerned network, the length distributions of ﬂows collected in any time interval
do not satisfy Pareto distributions with ﬁxed parameter strictly, but they can
follow a Pareto distribution with parameter in interval [0.5,1.5] approximately.
The value 1.0 is the middle value of interval [0.5,1.5] exactly. Therefore, to compute the conditional probability we assume that original ﬂow length has a Pareto
distribution with parameter 1.0 a priori distribution.

Estimation Method of Flow Length Distributions
Flow Classiﬁcation: Large Flow and Small Flow

Let g = {gj : j = 1, 2, · · · , n}, where gj is sampled ﬂow frequencies of length j,
be a set of sampled ﬂow length frequencies, f = {fi : i = 1, 2, · · · , n, · · ·} a set of
estimated original ﬂow length frequencies. Consider sampling the packets of an
original ﬂow of length N j independently with probability 1/N , the probability
that no packet is sampled is (1 − 1/N )N j = ((1 − 1/N )N )j . {(1 − 1/N )N } is
increasing in N and lim (1 − 1/N )N = 1/e < 0.37. Thus for a given error ε,we
N →∞

require (1 − 1/N )N j < (1/e)j < ε and choose jbord ≥ max(j(ε) = log(1/ε) , α).
For example, j(0.01) = 5, j(0.001) = 7. We classify two types of ﬂows based on
their probability that no packet is sampled. A ﬂow is labeled as small (S) when
it’s probability that no packet is sampled is more than ε and as large (L) when
it’s probability that no packet is sampled is less than or equal to ε.
3.2

Estimation for Large Flow

For a sampled ﬂow of length j > jbord , by Lemma 2, the original ﬂow length
values of the 2N relatively large probabilities are N (j −1)−n(p, β)+1, · · · , N (j +
1) − n(p, β) where β = 1.0. We estimate the sampled ﬂow is sampled from one

of the 2N original ﬂows. Then there are 2Nj sampled ﬂows that are sampled
from one of original ﬂows of the above lengths in gj (j > jbord ) sampled ﬂows.
Therefore, for all large ﬂows of length i > N jbord , we have
fi =

(gj + gj+1 ), where j = (i + n(p, β) − 1)/N .

Likelihood Function of Small Flows

For all small ﬂows of length i ≤ N jbord , we estimate as follows:

Because some solutions of Equations (6) may be negative, we don’t solve the
equations directly. We construct MLE and employ EM algorithm to compute
the solutions of Equations (6). For the above some gj ≤ 0, we replace it with
δgi−1 , 0 < δ < 1 . Below we only consider all small ﬂows of length 1, · · · , N jbord .

length i conditional on at least one of its packets being selected. Our aim is
to estimate φ = {φi }, i = 1, · · · , N jbord and i φi = 1, from the frequencies
{gi }. We now derive an expression for log-likelihood L(φ)to obtain g i given φ.
Here, cij = Bp (i, j)/(1 − Bp (i, 0)) is the probability that packets are sampled
from a ﬂow of length i,conditional on j ≥ 1 , i.e., that the ﬂow is sampled. For
any j , the function is ( i=j φi cij )g j . Hence we obtain the likelihood function

constraints φ ∈ Δ = {φ : φi ≥ 0, i φi = 1}.

EM Algorithm of Small Flows

Now we adopt a standard iterative approach: the Expectation Maximization
(EM) algorithm [9], the standard form is as follows.
Starting with an initial value φ(0) , for example, φ(0) = { gγi }, the algorithm
ﬁnds sup{L(φ) : φ ∈ Δ}, by iterating between the following two steps (k =
0, 1, · · ·):

Evaluations and Comparison

Computational complexity. Let jmax denote the maximum sampled ﬂow length.
The computation for binomial coeﬃcients of Equations (6) is O(N N jbord jmax ).
Tabulation of the binomial coeﬃcients for the iteration is O((N jbord )2 ). Then
for a ﬁxed φi , each EM iteration is O((N jbord )2 ). For all φi , completing an
EM iteration is O((N jbord )3 ). We compare the computational complexity of
our method against the best known EM algorithm in [8] for estimating ﬂow
distribution from sampled traﬃc. In [8] for all φi completing an EM iteration
is O(i2max jsize ). We collect all IP packet heads during a period of 300 minutes
at Jiangsu provincial network border of China Education and Research Network
(CERNET) (1Gbps) to do oﬄine experiment. For IP header data during a period
of 1 minute, sampling packets with p = 1/10 , in our method let ε = 0.01, then
jbord = 5, thus (N jbord )3 = 503 . However, imax = 2000, jsize = 200 in EM
algorithm of [8], i2max jsize = 6400 ∗ 503 .
Estimation accuracy: We adopt Weighted Mean Relative Diﬀerence (WMRD)
as our evaluation metric. Suppose the number of original ﬂows of length i is ni
and our estimation of this number is n

Conclusions

Estimating the distribution of ﬂow length is important in a number of network
applications. In this paper we present a novel method for estimation of ﬂow
length distributions from sampled ﬂow statistics. The main advantage is that it
could signiﬁcantly reduce the computational complexity. The theoretical analysis
shows that the computational complexity of our method is well under control.
The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an accurate
estimation for ﬂow distribution.
