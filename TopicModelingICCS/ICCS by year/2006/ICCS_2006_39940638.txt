Abstract. The Spectral Domain Method is powerful technique to analyze planar microwave circuits. But available conventional programming
languages used in the literature does not give the enough speed to use
the Spectral Domain Method to develop package analysis program. Functional approach to Spectral domain Method gives a high level of programming and a variety of features which help to build elegant yet powerfully
and general libraries of functions.

Introduction

For the last two decades, open microstrip structures have received special attention from the electromagnetic community because of their potential applications
in the design of new devices and components. Meanwhile, high–speed computer
has inﬂuenced the computation of electromagnetic problem to the point that
most practical computations of the ﬁelds can be solved numerically on the computer. The reason why, most of the analysis of the devices and components can
be achieved numerically but is almost impossible to be solved analytically. A lot
of eﬀorts have still been done on improving numerical techniques because complexity of the problems always overstretch the speed of the processors. Moreover
the operating frequency raised up for more available bandwidth, full–wave techniques which require more computer power and resources must be used.
A number of numerical full–wave techniques are reported in the literature
for the analysis of microstrip antennas [1], resonators [2] and circuits [3]. All
techniques reported in the literature have been either written by conventional
programming languages such as pascal and C or developed by using commercial
analysis tools such as Matlab. In the author knowledge none of the papers can
explored the idea of the way of programming such as functional or logic.
This contribution presents a functional programming approach to Spectral
Domain Method which is one of the full–wave numerical technique and widely
used for the analysis of the microwave and millimeter wave devices and components. With this approach, Spectral Domain Method have gained a high level of

programming giving its user a variety of features which help to build elegant yet
powerfully and general libraries of functions. Numerical results have also given
and compared with publish date to show the accuracy of the re–written Spectral Domain Method by Haskel which is widely used functional programming
language instead of conventional language such as pascal used in [3].

Functional Approach to SDM
Introduction

In this paper, ﬁve fundamental modules have been rewritten by using functional
approach instead of conventional programming language such as pascal to show
applicability of the approach. All of the modules are described in the sections
below.
2.2

Input Functions

In this module the input parameters are taken and passed to other modules.
Operating frequency, substrate layer parameters, kx , kz which are Fourier transform variables in x and z directions respectively, n which is number of layers, lx
and lz which are dimensions of rooftop function are used as input values. The
re–written module becomes as follows:
type Ind = Double
type D = Double
type M = Double
type E = Double
type Layer = [(Ind,D,M,E)]
type OneLayer = (Ind,D,M,E)
type Kx = Complex Double
type Kz = Complex Double
type Lx = Double
w :: Double
w = 2*3.1456*saveF
saveLayer :: IO - Layer
saveKx :: IO Kx
saveKz :: IO - Kz
saveLx :: IO - Lx
saveN :: IO - Double
saveF :: IO- Double
nx = saveKx/sqrt(saveKx*saveKx+saveKz*saveKz)
nz = saveKz/sqrt(saveKx*saveKx+saveKz*saveKz)
2.3

Empedans Functions

In this module the Green Function in the spectral domain has been calculated
by using functional approach. Mathematical formulation of the Green function
can be found in the literature such as [4, Chapter 4].

Numerical Results

In these sections below includes several analyzed example microwave structures
to show accuracy of the re–written program by using Spectral Domain Method
in Haskell which is one of the functional programming language. Total program
code have been optimized 55% compared to pascal code. As a result runtime has
been reduced 50% compared to pascal code run on the computer. The computer
has intel P4 2.4 GHz with 1 GB RD RAM. The operating system is Redhat
Linux 8.0.
3.1

Simple Low–Pass Filter

Measurement results are available for the microstrip low–pass ﬁlter [5] shown
in ﬁgure 1. The dimensions and parameters of the dielectric substrate are given
in ﬁgure 1.
The S–parameter results are plotted in ﬁgures 2 where it can be seen that
the calculated results and measurements are in very good agreement.
3.2

Edge–Coupled Filter

In order to further prove the accuracy of the re-written program, the analysis
of the microstrip edge–coupled ﬁlter shown in ﬁg. 6 in [6] is considered. The
measurements performed by Shibata et al [7] for this ﬁlter.
As seen in ﬁg. 3, there is a clear agreement between the newly written program
and measured data.

approach a model which retains the accuracy of the full–wave analysis technique
as well as the speed of the package programs has been introduced.
