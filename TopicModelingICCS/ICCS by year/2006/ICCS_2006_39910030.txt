Abstract. We derive a general form of the term structure of interest
rates with jump. One-state models of Vasicek, CIR(Cox, Ingersol, and
Ross), and the extended model of the Hull and White are introduced
and the jump-diﬀusion models of the Ahn & Thompson and the Baz &
Das as developed models are also investigated by using the Monte Carlo
simulation which is one of the best methods in ﬁnancial engineering to
evaluate ﬁnancial derivatives. We perform the Monte Carlo simulation
with several scenarios even though it takes a long time to achieve highly
precise estimates with the brute force method in terms of mean standard
error which is one measure of the sharpness of the point estimates.

Introduction

We introduce one-state variable model of Vasicek[9], Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross
(CIR)[3], the extended model of the Hull and White[6], and the development of
the models which are the jump-diﬀusion model of the Ahn and Thompson[1] and
the Baz and Das[2]. Conventionally, ﬁnancial variables such as stock prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates are assumed to follow a diﬀusion processes
with continuous paths when pricing ﬁnancial assets.
In pricing and hedging with ﬁnancial derivatives, jump-diﬀusion models are
particularly important, since ignoring jumps in ﬁnancial prices will cause pricing
and hedging rates. For interest rates, jump-diﬀusion processes are particularly
meaningful since the interest rate is an important economic variables which is,
to some extent, controlled by the government as an instrument. Term structure
model solutions under jump-diﬀusions are justiﬁed because movements in interest rates display both continuous and discontinuous behavior. These jumps are
caused by several market phenomena money market interventions by the Fed,
news surprise, and shocks in the foreign exchange markets, and so on.

Bond Pricing with Jumps and Monte Carlo Simulation

31

Ahn and Thompson[1] extended the CIR model by adding a jump component to the square root interest rate process. Using linearization technique, they
obtained closed-form approximations for discount bond prices. Also, Baz, and
Das[2] extended the Vasicek model by adding a jump component to the OrnsteinUhlenbeck(O-U) interest rate process, and obtained closed form approximate
solutions for bond price by the same linearization technique.
All of the models mentioned above take special functional forms for the coeﬃcients of dt, dW , and dπ in the stochastic diﬀerential equation for r. We derive a
general form of the term structure of interest rate with jump and study a solution
of the bond pricing for the above models. As above present a model which allows
the short term interest rate, the spot rate, the follow a random walk. This leads
to a parabolic partial diﬀerential equation for the prices of bonds and to models
for bonds and many other interest rate derivative products. Above in result, we
look into as the Vasicek, the CIR, the Hull and White, and the jump-diﬀusion
models.
In addition, we introduce the Monte Carlo simulation. One of the many uses
of Monte Carlo simulation by ﬁnancial engineers is to place a value on ﬁnancial
derivatives. Interest in use of Monte Carlo simulation for bond pricing is increasing because of the ﬂexibility of the methods in handling complex ﬁnancial
instruments. One measure of the sharpness of the point estimate of the mean
is Mean Standard Error(MSE). Numerical methods that are known as Monte
Carlo methods can be loosely described as statistical simulation methods, where
statistical simulation is deﬁned in quite general terms to be any method that
utilizes sequences of random numbers to perform the simulation.
The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the
basic of bond prices with jump are introduced. In Section 3, the term structure
models with jump are presented. In Section 4, we calculate numerical solutions
using Monte Carlo simulation for the term structure models with jump. In Section 5, we investigate bond prices given for the eight models using the Vasicek
and the CIR models. This paper is ﬁnally concluded in Section 6.

Bond Pricing Equation with Jump

In view of our uncertainty about the future course of the interest rate, it is
natural to model it as a random variable. To be technically correct we should
specify that r is the interest rate received by the shortest possible deposit. The
interest rate for the shortest possible deposit is commonly called the spot rate.
In the same way that a model for the asset price is proposed as a lognormal
random walk, let us suppose that the interest rate r is governed by a stochastic
diﬀerential equation(SDE) of the form
dr = u(r, t)dt + ω(r, t)dW + Jdπ

(1)

The functional forms of ω(r, t), u(r, t)(the instantaneous volatility and the instantaneous drift, respectively), and jump size J is normal variable with mean μ

and standard deviation γ determine the behavior of the spot rate r. We consider
a one-dimensional jump-diﬀusion process r(t) is satisfying

where π(t) represents the number of jumps happening during the period between
time 0 and t. When interest rates follow the SDE(1), a bond has a price of the
form V (r, t); the dependence on T will only be made explicit when necessary.
We set up a riskless portfolio and the jump-diﬀusion version of Ito’s lemma to
functions of r and t. And then, we derive the partial diﬀerential bond pricing
equation.

where λ(r, t) is the market price of risk. The ﬁnal condition corresponds to the
payoﬀ on maturity and so V (r, T, T ) = 1. Boundary conditions depend on the
form of u(r, t) and ω(r, t).

Term Structure Models with Jump

We denote by V (r, r, T ) the price at time t of a discount bond. It follows immediately that V (r, T, T ) = 1. In our framework, the yield curve is the same as term
structure of interest rate, as we only work with zero-coupon bonds. Now consider a quite diﬀerent type of random environment. Suppose π(t) represents the
total number of extreme shocks that occur in a ﬁnancial market until time t. The
time dependence can arise from the cyclical nature of the economy, expectations
concerning the future impact of monetary policies, and expected trends in other
macroeconomic variables. In this study, we extend the jump-diﬀusion version of
equilibrium single factor model to reﬂect this time dependence. This leads to the
following model for r:
β

dr(t) = [θ(t) − a(t)r(t)]dt + σ(t)r(t) dW (t) + Jdπ(t),

(4)

where θ(t) is a time-dependent drift; σ(t) is the volatility factor; a(t) is the
reversion rate. We investigate the β = 0 case is an extension of Vasicek’s jumpdiﬀusion model; the β = 0.5 case is an extension of CIR jump-diﬀusion model.
3.1

Jump-Diﬀusion Version of Extended Vasicek’s Model

We proposed the mean reverting process for interest rate r is given by the equation(4) with β = 0:
dr(t) = [θ(t) − a(t)r(t)]dt + σ(t)dW (t) + Jdπ(t)

(5)

Bond Pricing with Jumps and Monte Carlo Simulation

We will assume that the market price of interest rate diﬀusion risk is a function of time, λ(t). Let us assume that jump risk is diversiﬁable. From equation (5) with the drift coeﬃcient u(r, t) = θ(t) − a(t)r(t) and the volatility
coeﬃcient ω(r, t) = σ(t), we get the partial diﬀerential diﬀerence bond pricing
equation:

+ hV [−μA(t, T ) + (γ 2 + μ2 )A(t, T )2 ] = 0.

The price of a discount bond that pays oﬀ $ 1 at time T is the solution to
(6) that satisﬁes the boundary condition V (r, T, T ) = 1. A solution of the
form:
V (r, t, T ) = exp[−A(t, T )r + B(t, T )]

(7)

can be guessed. Bond price derivatives can be calculated from (7). We omit the
details, but the substitution of this derivatives into (6) and equating powers of
r yields the following equations for A and B.

where, φ(t) = θ(t) − λ(t)σ(t) and all coeﬃcients is constants. In order to satisfy
the ﬁnal data that V (r, T, T ) = 1 we must have A(T, T ) = 0 and B(T, T ) = 0.
3.2

Jump-Diﬀusion Version of Extended CIR Model

We propose the mean reverting process for interest rate r is given by the equation(4) with β = 0.5:
dr(t) = [θ(t) − a(t)r(t)]dt + σ(t)

r(t)dW (t) + Jdπ(t)

(10)

We will assume that the market price of interest rate diﬀusion risk is a function
of time, λ(t) r(t). Let us assume that jump risk is diversiﬁable.
In jump-diﬀusion version of extended Vasicek’s model the short-term interest rate, r, to be negative. If Jump-diﬀusion version of extended CIR model is
proposed, then rates are always non-negative. This has the same mean-reverting
drift as jump-diﬀusion version of extended Vasicek’s model, but the standard deviation is proportional to r(t). This means that its standard deviation increases
when the short-term interest rate increases. From equation(3) with the drift coeﬃcient u(r, t) = θ(t) − a(t)r(t) and the volatility coeﬃcient ω(r, t) = σ(t) r(t),
we get the partial diﬀerential bond pricing equation:

Bond price partial derivatives can be calculated from (11). We omit the details,
but the substitution of this derivatives into (7) and equating powers of r yields
the following equations for A and B.

where, ψ(t) = a(t) + λ(t)σ(t) and all coeﬃcients is constants. In order to satisfy
the ﬁnal data that V (r, T, T ) = 1 we must have A(T, T ) = 0 and B(T, T ) = 0.
Proof ). In equations (12) and (13), by using the solution of this Ricatti’s equation formula we have
A(t, T ) =
with ω(t) =

2(eω(t)(T −t) − 1)
(ω(t) + ψ(t))(eω(t)(T −t) − 1) + 2ω(t)

(15)

These equation yields the exact bond prices in the problem at hand. Equation
(15) can be solved numerically for B. Since (14) gives the value for A, bond
prices immediately follow from equation (7).

Monte Carlo Simulation of the Term Structure Models
with Jump

Recent methods of bond pricing do not necessarily exploit partial diﬀerential
equations(PDEs) implied by risk-neutral portfolios. They rest on converting
prices of such assets into martingales. This is done through transforming the
underlying probability distribution using the tools provided by the Girsanov’s
theorem. We now move on to discuss Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo
simulation of a stochastic process is a procedure for sampling random outcomes
for the process. This uses the risk-neutral valuation result. The bond price can
be expressed as:
V (rt , t, T ) = EtQ e−

where E Q is the expectations operator with respect to the equivalent risk-neutral
measure. To execute the Monte Carlo simulation, we discretize the equations (5)
and (12). we divide the time interval [t, T ] into m equal time steps of length Δt
each. For small time steps, we are entitled to use the discretized version of the
risk-adjusted stochastic diﬀerential equations (5) and (12):
rj = rj−1 + [(θ
√ · t) − (a · t)rj−1 · t − (λ · t)(σ · t)]Δt
+ (σ · t)εj Δt + Jj NΔt

(17)

rj = rj−1 + [(θ · t) − (a · t)rj−1 − (λ · t)(σ · t) rj−1 · t]Δt
√
+ (σ · t) rj−1 · t εj Δt + Jj NΔt ,

(18)

and

where j = 1, 2, · · ·, m, εj is standard normal variable with εj ∼ N (0, 1), and
NΔt is a Poisson random variable with parameter hΔt. We can investigate the
value of the bond by sampling n short rate paths under the discrete process
approximation of the risk-adjusted processes of the equations (17) and (18). The
bond price estimate is given by:
⎛
⎞
n
m−1
1
exp ⎝−
rij Δt⎠ ,
(19)
V (rt , t, T ) =
n i=1
j=0
where rij is the value of the short rate under the discrete risk-adjusted process
within sample path i at time t+Δt. Numerical methods that are known as Monte
Carlo methods can be loosely described as statistical simulation methods, where
statistical simulation is deﬁned in quite general terms to be any method that utilizes sequences of random numbers to perform the simulation. The Monte Carlo
simulation is clearly less eﬃcient computationally than the numerical method.
The precision of the mean as a point estimate is often deﬁned as the half-width
of a 95% conﬁdence interval, which is calculated as
P recision = 1.96 × M SE,
(20)
√
where MSE= ν/ n and ν 2 is the estimate of the variance of bond prices as
obtained from n sample paths of the short rate:

(21)

Lower values of Precision in Equation(20) correspond to sharper estimates. Increasing the number of n is a brute force method of obtaining sharper estimates.
This reduces the MSE by increasing the value of n. However, highly precise
estimates with the brute force method can take a long time to achieve. For the

36

purpose of simulation, we conduct three runs of 1,000 trials each and divide the
year into 365 time steps.

Conclusions

The Monte Carlo simulation is both harder and conceptually more diﬃcult to
implement than the other numerical methods. Interest in use of Monte Carlo
simulation for bond pricing is getting stronger because of its ﬂexibility in evaluating and handling complicated ﬁnancial instruments. However, it takes a long
time to achieve highly precise estimates with the brute force method. In this
paper we investigate bond pricing models and their Monte Carlo simulations
with several scenarios. The bond price is generally a decreasing function of the
maturity, but we found the fact that the bond price is humped in the jump
versions of the extended Vasicek and CIR models. In Monte Carlo simulation,
we know that the bond prices of the arbitrage models are larger than those of
the equilibrium models. Also lower values of precision in the equilibrium models
correspond to sharper estimates.
