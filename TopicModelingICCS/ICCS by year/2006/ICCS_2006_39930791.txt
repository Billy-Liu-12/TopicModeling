Abstract. We propose a dynamic resource allocation mechanism which
can be used in multi-agent computer network interconnection management systems. Considering a setting of multiple consumers and elastic
supply we argue that interaction between autonomous system resource
managers is a game. We make the following contributions. First, we analyze the stability of the Nash equilibrium point of the resource allocation
game. Second, we show that in comparison to the Cournot mechanism
the mechanism we propose may lead to solutions which are characterized
by a larger aggregate surplus.

Introduction

This paper is concerned with the dynamic resource allocation problem in a large
scale, decentralized systems, namely bandwidth allocation problem between Internet service providers. It is well known, that if networks are to oﬀer global
services, service providers must cooperate and exchange Internet traﬃc. The
obvious and intensively examined question that arises here is: how can network
resources be allocated in an eﬃcient way when network providers are most likely
to act in their own self interest? We apply the game theoretic approach to this
problem and propose a resource allocation mechanism which can be used in
multi-agent computer network interconnection management systems.
Consider a group of interconnected network service providers and focus on
dynamics of interactions between their autonomous systems. The basic observation we make suggests that since the number of interacting autonomous systems
is small, local decisions concerning network resource allocations can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on global network performance. Thus, decision makers, i.e.
resource managers, may anticipate the eﬀects of their actions on resource prices
and view these prices as functions of the actions of all decision makers. This kind
of interaction between autonomous system resource managers is a game.
We follow the approach applied by Johari and Tsitsiklis [3, 4, 5]. We analyze
the resource allocation game through its Nash equilibria and design a simple
market-clearing mechanism. The approach we apply is characterized by the three
salient features. First, the monetary value of resource allocation is measured by

aggregate utility less aggregate cost. Second, the system sets the single price for
resource unit to ensure demand equals supply. Third, agents anticipate the eﬀect
of their actions on market-clearing prices.
As we demonstrate in the following sections, the approach based on a simple
market-clearing mechanisms may lead to solutions which are characterized by
a very low computational and communicational complexity. From the network
management point of view this features are crucial. Furthermore, results of Johari
show that under reasonable assumptions the game we consider has a unique
Nash equilibrium point. We use this results as a springboard for our mechanism
design and propose a resource allocation mechanism which converges to this
unique Nash equilibrium point.
This paper makes two contributions. First, we show global stability of the
Nash equilibrium point of the game we consider. Second, we show that in comparison to the Cournot mechanism the mechanism we propose may lead to solutions that are characterized by a larger aggregate surplus. At this point we note
that when agents are price anticipating Nash equilibria of the game we consider do not generally ensure full eﬃciency. Therefore, our propositions should
be considered within the context of results of Johari and Tsitsiklis.

The Model

Following Kelly [1, 2] and Johari [3, 4, 5] suppose L agents compete for a single
resource. Let ai denote the rate allocated to agent i. First, we assume that:
Assumption 1. For each i ∈ L, over the domain ai ≥ 0 the utility function ui (ai ) is concave, strictly increasing, and continuous, and over the domain
ai > 0, ui (ai ) is continuously diﬀerentiable. Furthermore, the right directional
derivative at 0, denoted ui (0+ ), is ﬁnite.
The total cost of using the amount x =
the following assumption:

i∈L

ai of a resource is c(x). We make

Assumption 2. There exists a continuous, convex, strictly increasing price
function p(x) over 0 ≤ x < C with p(0) ≥ 0, such that for 0 ≤ x < C:
x

c(x) =

p(y)dy.

(1)

0

Thus total cost function c(x) is strictly convex and strictly increasing over 0 ≤
x < C.
Suppose that the total payment agent i is willing to make for the amount ai of
resource is wi . Let w = [w1 , ..., wL ]T .
Assumption 3. For all w ≥ 0, the aggregate allocation x(w) =
i∈L ai (w)
is the unique solution to i∈L wi = x(w)p(x(w)). Furthermore, for each i ∈ L:
ai (w) =

wi /p(x(w)), wi > 0
0,
wi = 0 .

Assumption 4. p(x) is diﬀerentiable and exhibits nondecreasing elasticity ε(x)
= (∂p(x)/∂x) · (x/p(x)) for 0 ≤ x < C.
Now, consider a game in which, having w−i = [w1 , ..., wi−1 , wi+1 , ..., wL ]T ﬁxed,
player i selects wi ≥ 0 to maximize his payoﬀ:
Qi (ai (wi , w−i ), wi ) = ui (ai (wi , w−i )) − wi .

(3)

Agent i does not know w−i , but he knows that the price p(x(w)) and ai (w)
depend on it. Furthermore, he anticipates his own inﬂuence on the price. Denote
the right directional derivative of f (x) at x by ∂ + f (x)/∂x and the left directional
derivative by ∂ − f (x)/∂x . The following results hold:
Proposition 1. (Johari) If Assumptions 1-3 hold, then w is a Nash equilibrium of the game deﬁned by (Qi (ai (w), wi ))i∈L , if and only if i∈L wi > 0, and
for ai ≡ ai (w) > 0 and x ≡ x(w) the following two conditions hold:

(4)
Conversely, if a(w) ≥ 0 and x > 0 satisfy (4), and x(w) = i∈L ai (w), then
the vector w = [p(x(w)) · a1 (w), ..., p(x(w)) · aL (w)]T is a Nash equilibrium.
Proposition 2. (Johari) Suppose Assumptions 1-4 hold. Then there exists a
unique Nash equilibrium w
ˆ for the game deﬁned by (Qi (ai (w), wi ))i∈L .
Proposition 3. Suppose Assumptions 1-4 hold and w

the game deﬁned by (Qi (ai (w), wi ))i∈L . Then the following conditions hold:

Proof. Denote β(x) = ε(x)/(1 + ε(x)). Notice, that at equilibrium:

The Mechanism

We use Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 to design a resource allocation mechanism which can be used in the resource negotiation process between agents.
Definition 1. We deﬁne operator Rxi [f (x1 , ..., xN )] as follows:
xˆi ∈ Rxi [f (x1 , ..., xN )] = ∅

⇔

f (x1 , ..., xˆi , ..., xN ) = 0.

i∈L

The mechanism we introduce allocates resources according to Assumption 3,
i.e. it sets the price p(x(w)) to ensure demand i∈L wi /p(x) equals supply x.
Strategies wi received by the mechanism denote willingness each agent has to
pay for the rate ai of resource at the unit price p(x(w)). These are equal to
p(x(w)) · a
ˆi , where a
ˆi maximizes payoﬀs Qi (ai (w), wi ) at the price p(x(w)).
We now analyze convergence properties of mechanism (7) -(10) and examine
the stability of the Nash equilibrium point w.

Proof. Denote p ≡ p(x(w)). Suppose that p ≤ pˆ. The optimal response to price

p must lead to allocation for which the following condition holds: i∈L a
−ai (w) ≥ 0. Conversely, if p > pˆ then i∈L a
ˆi (w) − ai (w) < 0. Now, condition
ˆi (w) − ai (w) ≥ 0 implies that optimal price pˆ must be higher than or

If Assumptions 1-4 hold, then Nash equilibrium point of the game deﬁned by
(Qi (ai (w), wi ))i∈L is an globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the
system:
w(t)
˙
= F (w(t)).
(12)
Proof. First notice, that the only stationary point of system F (w(t)) is w =
p(x(w))ˆ
a(w). Now, we show that p(x(w(t))) converges to equilibrium price
ˆ when agents set their payments according to F (w(t)). We

have:

So, for w(0) = w0 price p(x(w(t))) converges to pˆ. Under assumptions of the

game with payoﬀs deﬁned by:

Proposition 5 shows that in comparison to the Cournot model the proposed
mechanism (7)-(10) allocates more resources. Furthermore, Proposition 6 proves
that it may lead to the higher aggregate surplus.
Figure 1 shows optimal response curves for two agents. Notice that since
ai (aj (w)) ≥ ai (aj ), at intersection point E w both agents obtain more resources
then at E a . Figure 2 demonstrates convergence of the mechanism (7)-(10).

Example

In this section we illustrate the results presented above. Suppose that L agents
negotiate bandwidth allocations with local resource manger and that their utility
functions are given by:
ui (ai (w)) = γi log(ai (w) + 1),

(∀i ∈ L).

Suppose also that p(x) = (C − x)−1 , where C is eﬀective bandwidth. Now, consider a provisioning problem. Suppose resource manager wants to sell a bandwidth of C = 45 Mbps to three groups of agents: L1 = {1..10}, L1.5 = {11..20}
and L25 = {21, 22}. Group L1 needs a peak rate of 1Mbps, group L1.5 a peak
rate of 1.5Mbps and group L25 a peak rate of 25Mbps. Let γi be random variables, independent and uniformly distributed on intervals [3, 5], [5, 7] and [20, 21]
for i ∈ {L1 , L1.5 , L25 } respectively. We simulate the following scenario:
– t < 0: equilibrium state
– t = 1: agent i = 21 departs;
– t = 2: agent i = 21 joins, agents {11..18} depart;

798

M. Karpowicz and K. Malinowski

– t = 3: agents {1..10} depart;
– t = 4: all agents join competition.
The scenario events take place when a − a
ˆ < 0.00001. We compare results
obtained from mechanism (7)-(10) to results obtained from the Cournot mechanism. Notice that in the Cournot model agents submit allocations they want
to buy at price p(x(a)). In case of mechanism (7)-(10) agents submit payments
for allocations they need at price p(x(w)). Figures 3 present results of the simulation. Indeed, mechanism (7)-(10) allocates more resources than the Cournot
mechanism and generates higher aggregate surplus.
