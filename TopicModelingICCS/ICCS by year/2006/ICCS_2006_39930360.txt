Abstract. In the previous paper [1] we presented general methods for
detecting the evolution and dynamics of any one of the 255 fuzzy cellular
automata (FCA) and showed that the method was applicable to all but
nine of the 255 FCA. The main result there was that the limiting behavior
of these FCA is decidable, except possibly for these nine, for finite initial
configurations in a homogeneous background of zeros. Only six of these
nine so called exceptional CA namely, FCA 172, 184, 202, 216, 226, and
228, appear to be interesting enough to warrant separate study, the other
three, namely FCA 204, 228, and 240 being trivial. In this paper we study
the exceptional FCA 184, a cellular automaton that admits a continuum
of fixed points, namely the interval [0, 1]. This FCA is of interest because
the general technique developed in [1] fails for the determination of its
asymptotics. We show, in particular, that the asymptotic evolution of
FCA 184 from any finite initial including random configuration of nonzero cells is decidable.

Introduction

The elementary cellular automata (ECA), considered by Wolfram and others,
are wonderful examples of systems with simple rules that may produce unusually
complex behavior; some of them, which are hardly predictable, are even capable
of universal computation, [2]. On the other hand, one may get a better sense of
their behavior by approximating their dynamics by continuous state CA’s (or
coupled map lattices), to wit, by “fuzzifying” the disjunctive normal form (the
ECA is then called an FCA) and then studying the dynamics of the resulting
global function as was done in [3]. Recent work in this new area of continuous
CA’s includes some variations on the game of Life in [4] and applications to pattern recognition [5]. In addition, such CA have been used to investigate the result
of perturbations, for example, noisy sources, computation errors, mutations, etc.
on the evolution of boolean cellular automata (cf., [6], [3], [7], etc.).
We recall some terminology for ease of exposition: A one-dimensional (boolean
or binary-state) cellular automaton is a collection of ones and zeros (called an
initial string) arranged on an inﬁnite one-dimensional strip (where the space
variable goes in the horizontal direction). Each cell is preceded by a cell behind it
and another in front of it; these are called the neighbors of the cell. In the notation

of [8] these are known as “k = 2, r = 1 CA’s”. We choose an arbitrary (but ﬁxed)
special element of this initial strip (at time t = 0) by labeling it as x0 (or by
x00 ). Denoting the two-point set (or boolean space) consisting of the numbers 0
and 1 by {0, 1} we deﬁne a local rule (sometimes also called a transition rule) by
a function g : {0, 1}3 → {0, 1}, on consecutive triples xi−1 , xi , xi+1 of this strip
with the eﬀect that f (x)i = g(xi−1 , xi , xi+1 ) where the value f (x)i is placed
directly below xi , where time goes vertically down the diagram (on another such
parallel strip which determines the states of the automaton at t = 1) and this
update of the original cell values is performed for all the quantities in the initial
string resulting in two parallel strips. The procedure is then repeated again and
again to generate an inﬁnite sequence of strips whose evolution at inﬁnity we
wish to study. The resulting diagram is called a light-cone or space-time diagram,
see [8]. It follows that for a given general CA with transition rule g its states are
related by
= g(xti−1 , xti , xti+1 ), t ≥ 0.
xt+1
i
Now, in the normal boolean case, each of three consecutive cells can have two
values, namely, 0 and 1. Thus, the automaton is uniquely determined once its
values on the eight basic elements 000, 001, 010, 100, 110, 101, 011, 111 are known.
So there can be at most 28 = 256 such CA’s and these are commonly known
as the elementary cellular automata (ECA for short). To distinguish each automaton from every other in this list of several hundred, Wolfram [9] used a
numbering scheme based on the binary expansion of each number n in the form
∞
i
n =
i=0 ri 2 , where 0 ≤ n ≤ 255 and combined this with the disjunctive
normal form. Speciﬁcally, every transition rule of such elementary CA’s is expressible as a disjunctive normal form (abbr. DNF), e.g.,
d

g(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = ∨i|ri =1 ∧3j=1 xj ij
where dij is the j-th digit, from left to right, of the binary representation of i,
and x0 (resp. x1 ) stands for ¬x (resp. x). This DNF is simply a comprehensive
device for the writing of any one of the 256 ECA’s. We are particularly interested
in ECA 184 and its “fuzziﬁcation” deﬁned below. Indeed, since 184 = 23 + 24 +
25 + 27 we see that the so called rule number 184 = 7i=0 ri 2i forces ri = 1 only
for i = 3, 4, 5, 7. Use of the disjunctive normal form expression above gives us
d

g184 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = ∨i|ri =1 ∧3j=1 xj ij ,
= (xd131 ∧ xd232 ∧ xd333 ) ∨ (xd141 ∧ xd242 ∧ xd343 ) ∨ (xd151 ∧ xd252 ∧ xd353 )
∨(xd171 ∧ xd272 ∧ xdj 73 ),
= (x01 ∧ x12 ∧ x13 ) ∨ (x11 ∧ x02 ∧ x03 ) ∨ (x11 ∧ x02 ∧ x13 )
∨(x11 ∧ x12 ∧ x13 ),
= (¬x1 ∧ x2 ∧ x3 ) ∨ (x1 ∧ ¬x2 ∧ ¬x3 ) ∨ (x1 ∧ ¬x2 ∧ x3 ) ∨
∨(x1 ∧ x2 ∧ x3 ).
The last equation represents the canonical expression of ECA 184.

It was pointed out in [3] that although ECA 184 belongs to (Wolfram’s) Class I
and so is considered to be one of the simplest, its “. . . evolution in fuzzy backgrounds indicates otherwise . . . in particular the interaction between fuzziness
and boolean cells creates complex structures. Even though it is diﬃcult to theoretically explain this behavior, the experimental results quite clearly indicate
that this is not a simple rule” [[3], p. 112].
A CA on [0, 1] is said to be a continuous CA if its domain is [0, 1] × [0, 1] ×
[0, 1] ≡ [0, 1]3 and its range is contained in the interval [0, 1]. If g is a general
continuous CA on [0, 1] its fixed point set is by deﬁnition the collection of all
points x ∈ [0, 1] such that g(x, x, x) = x. This set may consist of either a single
point, a ﬁnite number of such points, or even the whole interval [0, 1]. The latter
occurs for the special CA dubbed FCA 184 that we study in this paper. We now
turn to the concept of fuzzy CA’s or, for brevity, FCA.
A Fuzzy CA is obtained by fuzzification of the local function of a Boolean CA:
in the disjunctive normal form by redeﬁning (a ∨ b) as (a + b), (a ∧ b) as (ab), and
(¬a) as (1 − a). The usual fuzziﬁcation of the expression a ∨ b is max{1, a + b}
so as to ensure that the result is not larger than 1. Note, however, that taking
(a + b) for the CA fuzziﬁcation does not lead to values greater than 1 since the
sum of all the expressions for rule 255 is 1 (i.e., g255 (x, y, z) = 1), and so every
(necessarily non-negative) partial sum must be bounded by 1. Since every fuzzy
rule is obtained by adding one or more of these partial sums it follows that every
fuzzy rule is bounded below by 0 and above by 1. We refer the reader to the
many articles in the references provided below, e.g, [1] for a brief explanation of
the basic principles behind the notion of fuzzy CA, or FCA as we call them here.
Recall that in “fuzzifying” the DNF above (1), we replace ¬x by 1 − x, x ∨ y by
x + y, and x ∧ y in (1) by their product, xy. By deﬁnition fuzzy CA are special
cases of continuous CA.
Example 1. Referring to (1) and using the fuzziﬁcation procedure outlined above,
we can write the form of FCA 184: Thus, starting from the disjunctive normal
form of ECA 184,
g184 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (¬x1 ∧ x2 ∧ x3 ) ∨ (x1 ∧ ¬x2 ∧ ¬x3 ) ∨ (x1 ∧ ¬x2 ∧ x3 ) ∨
∨(x1 ∧ x2 ∧ x3 )
we fuzzify it to ﬁnd
= (1 − x1 )x2 x3 + x1 (1 − x2 )(1 − x3 ) + x1 (1 − x2 )x3 + x1 x2 x3 ,
(2)
= x1 − x1 x2 + x2 x3 .
The transition rule derived from (2) for (x1 , x2 , x3 ) ∈ [0, 1]3 in accordance with
the fuzziﬁcation process deﬁned here is denoted by FCA 184 (its two-state counterpart being given by (1)).
We suggest that one of the reasons that this FCA deserves special attention is
that its ﬁxed-point set is a continuum, namely the whole closed interval [0, 1],
(one of only 9 out of 255 such FCA, see [1] for the general theory). In addition,
our purpose here is an attempt to explain previous insights in [3], at least theoretically. Generally speaking, although there are some exceptions, the evolution

On the Decidability of the Evolution of the Fuzzy Cellular Automaton 184

363

of a space-time diagram is undecidable, at least in the special case of boolean
ECA. In this note we will actually determine the evolution of the space-time
diagram of this FCA thereby answering an open question in [3], and thereby
showing that its evolution is decidable in sharp contrast with the boolean case.

The Space-Time Diagram of FCA 184 and its Evolution
over Time

Writing the canonical form of rule 184 as g184 (x, y, z) = x − xy + yz, its diagonal
function d(x) ≡ g184 (x, x, x) is given by solving the equation d(x) = x. Thus,
every real number in [0, 1] is a ﬁxed point (it is this fact that characterizes the
other eight exceptional rules as well).
Next, for a single seed a in a zero background observe that, by induction,
xnn = a for each n ≥ 1, so that this rule is a right-shift. Clearly, for a single seed
its dynamics are trivial. The diﬃculty occurs when we pass to the case of ﬁnite
support/random initial strings of length greater than one.
Consider the case of two seeds, a, b ∈ (0, 1), in a zero background. We take it
that x00 = a, x01 = b (so that x01 is to the right of x00 ). Recall [1] that the symbol
xj±i denotes the cell value i cells to the right (or left) of x00 at time j (i.e, the
j th -row). The convergence of the right-diagonals and the dynamics of our FCA
along them is of special interest in this article. It is easy to see that xn−1
=b
n
for all n ≥ 1, so that the limit of this sequence (or zeroth diagonal, S0+ ), is
+
L+
0 = b. Next, we note that the terms of the ﬁrst right-diagonal, S1 , are given
n
n
by xn = a(1 − b) , a result that is easily veriﬁed by an induction argument. It
follows that its limit, L+
1 = 0, except in the special case where b = 0, in which
case this reduces to the single seed scenario already discussed above. Diﬃculties
arise in the discussion bearing on the next diagonal, S2+ . Applying the technique
presented in [1] to this situation, one that was successful in [10] and [11], we
+
+
+
+
+
have that L+
2 = g184 (L2 , L1 , L0 ) = g184 (L2 , 0, b) = L2 . Thus, no a priori in+
formation regarding L2 is obtainable using the methods in [1], as they stand
(and this is characteristic of these few exceptional FCA). Thus, a new technique

is needed and the following method serves as a blueprint that also applies to the
remaining exceptional FCA. Observe that by deﬁnition,
= xnn−1 (1 − a(1 − b)n ) + ab(1 − b)n ,
xn+1
n
we get a simple recurrence relation for yn , i.e.,
for n ≥ 1. Deﬁning abyn ≡ xn+1

for k ≥ 1. Furthermore, since |yn+1 −yn | ≤ (1−b)n+1 it follows that the sequence
{yn } is a Cauchy sequence. Its limit L+

in (3) and rearranging terms, is given by

where the inﬁnite products are convergent by virtue of their form. Note that

implies that

L+

,
n

zn = zn−1 (1 − abyn ) + a2 yn b(1 − b)n ,
whose solution can be written once again but is omitted here for brevity. Con+
tinuing in this way one can show by induction that L+
2k−1 = 0, L2k−2 = 0, for
k ≥ 1, found by solving ﬁrst order recurrence relations leading to solutions involving complicated inﬁnite products in the variables a, b. Clearly, this method
leads to an algorithm for producing the limits L+
k of the right-diagonals of the
space-time diagram of FCA 184. Note that the left diagonals produce zero limits
at inﬁnity.
The case of three or more seeds is similar to the two-seed case and is sketched
for completeness. We assume a homogeneous background of zeros in which there
is embedded the initial string . . . 0, 0, 0, x0−m, . . . , x00 , x01 , 0, 0, 0, . . . of non-zero cell

values. Then, as before, L+
0 = x1 and xn = x0 (1 − x1 ) so that, once again,
+

n+1
L1 = 0. Taking x0 x1 yn ≡ xn we get a corresponding recurrence relation for
yn ,
yn = yn−1 (1 − x00 (1 − x01 )n ) + (1 − x01 )n , y0 = 1.
The solution of the preceding equation is representable as a quantity analogous
to (3) above so that the existence of L+
2 is guaranteed and is an expression

On the Decidability of the Evolution of the Fuzzy Cellular Automaton 184

similar to (4) involving inﬁnite products. As in the two-seed case, the quantities
+
L+
2k−1 = 0, L2k−2 = 0, for k ≥ 1. This completes the analysis of the ﬁnite initial
conﬁguration case.
As for vertical columns/sequences of the form xj0 , xj1 , etc. for j ≥ 1, it is
unlikely that these vertical sequences will converge at all due to the alternating
nature of zero limits (i.e., L+
2k−1 = 0) along right-diagonals. Speciﬁcally, if one
can show that the limit of the limits, L+
2k−2 → 0, as k → ∞ (which we cannot
prove) then one can infer that the vertical sequences will all converge to zero.
Numerical evidence though seems to support this claim (cf., Table 1). On the
other hand, if
lim inf L+
2k−2 > 0,
k→∞

then for each i ≥ 0, limk→∞ xki does not exist.

Conclusion

We have shown that FCA 184, one of six exceptional fuzzy cellular automata [1]
whose set of ﬁxed points is a continuum, has complicated behavior at inﬁnity
but does not lend itself to complexity, thus answering a question raised in [3].
Indeed, the asymptotic nature of its space-time diagram is deterministic and
apparently non-chaotic, the evolution from any ﬁnite random initial string of
fuzzy values in the open unit interval being decidable, as opposed to its boolean
counterpart.
