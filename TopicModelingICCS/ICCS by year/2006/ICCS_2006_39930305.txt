Abstract. Complex stochastic Boolean systems, depending on a large
number n of statistically independent random Boolean variables, appear
in many diﬀerent scientiﬁc, technical or social areas. Each one of the 2n
binary states associated to such systems is denoted by its corresponding
binary n-tuple of 0s and 1s, (u1 , . . . , un ), and it has a certain occurrence
probability Pr {(u1 , . . . , un )}. The ordering between the 2n binary ntuple probabilities, Pr {(u1 , . . . , un )}, can be illustrated by a directed
graph which “scales” them by decreasing order, the so-called intrinsic
order graph. In this context, this paper provides a simple algorithm for
iteratively drawing the intrinsic order graph, for any complex stochastic
Boolean system and for any number n of independent random Boolean
variables. The presentation is self-contained.

Introduction

This paper deals with the modelling of complex stochastic Boolean systems, that
is, those complex systems which depend on a large number n of random Boolean
variables x1 , . . . , xn . These systems, with very simple components (the Boolean
variables xi only take two possible values: 0, 1) but complex overall behavior,
can be found in many diﬀerent knowledge areas: Wherever a stochastic Boolean
phenomenon with n basic variables appears (Biology, Biochemistry, Climatology,
Computer Science, Networks, Engineering, Economics, Sociology, etc.).
According to the usual terminology in Statistics, a stochastic Boolean system can be modeled by the n-dimensional Bernoulli distribution (see, e.g., [6]).
This distribution consists on n random variables x1 , . . . , xn , which only take two
possible values, 0 or 1, with probabilities
Pr {xi = 1} = pi , Pr {xi = 0} = 1 − pi

strings), u = (u1 , . . . , un ), of 0s and 1s. Throughout this work, we assume that

the random variables xi are mutually independent, so that the occurrence probability of each binary n-tuple can be easily computed as the product

that is, Pr {(u1 , . . . , un )} is the product of factors pi if ui = 1, 1-pi if ui = 0.
The following natural question immediately arises in the study of stochastic
Boolean systems: How can we order the 2n binary strings (u1 , . . . , un ) by decreasing/increasing order of their occurrence probabilities? Obviously, this question
has a relevant, theoretical and practical, interest. However, in spite of the simplicity of Equation (1) to compute the probabilities Pr {(u1 , . . . , un )}, this is not
a simple question due to its exponential nature. To avoid this obstacle, in [3, 4]
the authors have established a simple positional criterion, the so-called Intrinsic
Order Criterion ( IOC), that a priori assures us that for certain pairs of binary
n
n-tuples u, v ∈ {0, 1} (exactly for those pairs whose bits satisfy IOC), the inequality Pr {u} ≥ Pr {v} intrinsically holds, that is, Pr {u} ≥ Pr {v} for any
values of the parameters pi satisfying certain non restrictive hypothesis. Moreover, in [1, 2] the author has “roughly” constructed the intrinsic order graph for
the ﬁrst values of n, just by direct application of IOC. However, a general method
for easily constructing this graph for all n ∈ N, has not yet been provided.
In this context, the main goal of this paper is to provide a simple algorithm
for recursively drawing the intrinsic order graph, for any number n of Boolean
variables. This directed graph is a very useful picture for all complex stochastic
Boolean systems (related to any knowledge area), because it “scales” the binary
n
n-tuples of 0s and 1s, (u1 , . . . , un ) ∈ {0, 1} , by decreasing order of their occurrence probabilities. In Sect. 2, we describe all previous results required for
making this paper self-contained. The rest of the paper is devoted to our new
approach. In Sect. 3, we present a simple characterization of the covering relation
of the intrinsic order. Finally, in Sect. 4, from this characterization we derive the
algorithm for drawing the intrinsic order graph.

The Intrinsic Order

In [3, 4], we have established the following characterization theorem that allows
us to compare two given binary string probabilities, Pr {u} and Pr {v}, without
computing them.
Theorem 1 (The intrinsic order theorem). Let x1 , . . . , xn be n independent
Bernoulli variables, with parameters pi = Pr {xi = 1} (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfying:
0 < p1 ≤ · · · ≤ pn ≤

.

(2)
n

Then, the probability of the n-tuple (u1 , . . . , un ) ∈ {0, 1} is intrinsically greater
n
than or equal to the probability of the n-tuple (v1 , . . . , vn ) ∈ {0, 1} (that is, for

all set of parameters {pi }ni=1 such that (2)) if, and only if, the matrix
u1 . . . un
v1 . . . vn

Mvu :=

either has no 10 columns, or for each 10 column there exists (at least) one
corresponding preceding 01 column (IOC).
Remark 1. In the following, we assume that the parameters pi always satisfy
condition (2). Note that this hypothesis is not restrictive for practical applications because, if for some i : pi > 12 , then we only need to consider the variable
xi = 1 − xi , instead of xi . Next, we order the n Bernoulli variables by increasing
order of their probabilities.
Remark 2. The 01 column preceding to each 10 column is not required to be
necessarily placed at the immediately previous position, but just at previous
position.
Remark 3. The term corresponding, used in Theorem 1, has the following meaning: For each two 10 columns in matrix Mvu , there must exist (at least) two
diﬀerent 01 columns preceding to each other. In other words, IOC requires that
for each 10 column C in matrix Mvu , if we denote by n01 (C) (n10 (C), resp.) the
number of 01 columns ( 10 columns, resp.) preceding C, then n01 (C) > n10 (C).
Theorem 1 naturally leads to the following partial order relation on the set
n
{0, 1} . The so-called intrinsic order (because it only depends of the relative positions of 0s and 1s in the binary n-tuples u, v, but not on the basic probabilities
pi ), will be denoted by “ ”, and we shall denote by Pn the partially ordered set
n
(poset, for short) ({0, 1} , ). See [5] for more details about posets.

From now on, we shall indistinctly denote any n-tuple u ∈ {0, 1} by its binary
representation (u1 , . . . , un ) or by its decimal representation u(10 . Also, we shall
denote by “≤lex ” the usual lexicographic order (truth-table order) between the
binary n-tuples, with the convention that 0 < 1, i.e.,
n

(u1 , . . . , un ) ≡ u(10 :=

The next corollary (see [2] for the proof) states the relation between the (partial)
intrinsic order “ ” and the (total) lexicographic order “≤lex ”.

v ⇒ u(10 ≤ v(10.

Covering Relation in Pn

As is well-known [5], every ﬁnite poset is completely determined by its cover
relations. Speciﬁcally, with respect to our poset Pn , we say that v is covered
by u (or u covers v ), denoted by v
u (or u
v ) if v ≺ u and there is no
n

2

w ∈ {0, 1} such that v ≺ w ≺ u. For instance, in P2 = {0, 1} ,
, we have
(1, 1) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 0) because (1, 1) ≺ (1, 0) ≺ (0, 1) ≺ (0, 0) (Deﬁnition
1, Theorem 1) with no other elements between them. However, (1, 1) ≺ (0, 1)
but (1, 1) (0, 1), because (1, 0) is between them. In this section, we provide a
simple matrix characterization of the covering relation associated to the intrinsic
order. This condition for “ ”, required for drawing the intrinsic order graph in
the next section, will be obviously a particular case of (more restrictive than)
the IOC condition for “ ”. First, we need the following lemma.
n

Lemma 1. Let u, v ∈ {0, 1} and 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.
(i) If v u then (v1 , . . . , vi ) (u1 , . . . , ui ).
... ui
has the same number of
(ii) If v u and uv11 ...

then (vi+1 , . . . , vn ) (ui+1 , . . . , un ).
i+1
are both diﬀerent from 10 , then
(iii) If v u and the columns uvii and uvi+1
the matrix obtained by permuting these two columns of Mvu , keeping its other
columns, satisﬁes IOC.
(iv) If v u, uvii = 01 , uvjj = 10 for some j > i, and there is no k such that

i < k < j and uvkk =
j-th columns of Mvu by

, then the matrix obtained by replacing the i-th and
or 11 , keeping its other columns, satisﬁes IOC.

Proof. Using the matrix description IOC of the intrinsic order (Theorem 1), the
proof is straightforward.

v u if and only if either

, or
(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) ,

where we assume that in case (3) the n−1 ﬁrst columns of matrix Mvu are deleted
if n = 1; while in case (4) the i − 1 ﬁrst (the n − i − 1 last, resp.) columns of
matrix Mvu are deleted if i = 1 (if i = n − 1, resp.).

309

Proof. Suﬃcient condition. First, note that, for both cases (3) and (4), v ≺ u
since the two corresponding matrices Mvu obviously satisfy IOC. So, for both
cases, we only need to prove that if v w u then w = u or w = v.
If (3) holds then using Corollary 1, we have v
then w = u or w = v.
If (4) holds then using Corollary 1, we have v
then two subcases are possible:
(w1 , . . . , wi+1 ) =

w

u ⇒ u ≤lex w ≤lex v and

w

u ⇒ u ≤lex w ≤lex v and

(u1 , . . . , ui−1 , 0, 1)
(u1 , . . . , ui−1 , 1, 0)

(4)-a,
(4)-b.

– If i = n − 1, then (4)-a is equivalent to say w = u while (4)-b is equivalent
to say w = v. Then, w = u or w = v.
– Otherwise, if 1 ≤ i < n − 1, then using Lemma 1-(ii), we have: On one
1 ... wi−1 wi wi+1
has the same number of
hand, since v w and matrix w
0
u1 ... ui−1 1
1
0

columns as 01 columns (namely, 1 if (4)-a holds and 0 if (4)-b holds)
then we get (ui+2 , . . . , un ) (wi+2 , . . . , wn ). On the other hand, since w
u and matrix

u1 ... ui−1 0
1
w1 ... wi−1 wi wi+1

has the same number of

1
0

columns as

0
1

columns (namely, 0 if (4)-a holds and 1 if (4)-b holds) then we get
(wi+2 , . . . , wn ) (ui+2 , . . . , un ). So, due to the antisymmetry of the intrinsic
order we obtain (wi+2 , . . . , wn ) = (ui+2 , . . . , un ), and then w = u (if (4)-a
holds) or w = v (if (4)-b holds).
n

Necessary condition. We provide a constructive proof by ﬁnding w ∈ {0, 1}
yielding v w u, for all v ≺ u such that the pattern of matrix Mvu is diﬀerent
from (3) and (4). First, note that since v ≺ u we assure (Corollary 1) that
u <lex v, i.e., the ﬁrst column of Mvu diﬀerent from 00 and 11 is 01 . Let uvii
be this column. Then
Mvu =

u1 . . . ui−1 0 ui+1 ui+2 . . . un
u1 . . . ui−1 1 vi+1 vi+2 . . . vn

,

(5)

where we can assure that 1 ≤ i < n, because if i = n then Mvu in (5) would be
like (3), and we assume that the i − 1 ﬁrst (the n − i − 1 last, resp.) columns
of matrix (5) are deleted if i = 1 (if i = n − 1, resp.). The same assumption is
established for the i − 1 ﬁrst (the n − i − 1 last, resp.) components of the chosen
vectors w. We distinguish the following four cases.

. In this case we choose

w = (u1 , . . . , ui−1 , 0, 1, vi+2 , . . . , vn ) , so that v = w = u and
u1 ... ui−1 0 1 vi+2 ... vn
u1 ... ui−1 0 0 ui+2 ... un
and Mwu =
u1 ... ui−1 1 0 vi+2 ... vn
u1 ... ui−1 0 1 vi+2 ... vn
satisfy IOC: the ﬁrst one obviously; the second one due to Lemma 1-(iii).

w = (u1 , . . . , ui−1 , 0, 1, vi+2 , . . . , vn ) , so that v = w = u and

In this subcase we choose

w = (u1 , . . . , ui−1 , 0, 1, vi+2 , . . . , vj−1 , 1, vj+1 , . . . , vn ) , so that v = w = u

if j = i + 2. Then
Mvw =

1 ≤ i < n. Moreover, in this fourth case we can assure that 1 ≤ i < n − 1
and (vi+2 , . . . , vn ) = (ui+2 , . . . , un ), because if i = n − 1 or if i < n − 1 with
(vi+2 , . . . , vn ) = (ui+2 , . . . , un ) then, in both cases, Mvu in (5) would has the
pattern (4). In this last case we choose

w = (u1 , . . . , ui−1 , 0, 1, vi+2 , . . . , vn ) , so that v = w = u and
Mvw =

u1 ... ui−1 0 1 vi+2 ... vn
u1 ... ui−1 1 0 vi+2 ... vn

and Mwu =

u1 ... ui−1 0 1 ui+2 ... un
u1 ... ui−1 0 1 vi+2 ... vn

satisfy IOC: the ﬁrst one obviously; the second one due to Lemma 1-(iv ).

The Intrinsic Order Graph

The classical picture of a poset P is its Hasse diagram. This is a directed graph
(digraph, for short) whose vertices are the elements of P , whose edges are the
cover relations, and with the usual convention that if v ≺ u then u is drawn

“above” v [5]. For instance, the digraph of P1 is | , since 1

0. The next theorem

1

provides us with a fast algorithm for iteratively building up the Hasse diagram
of Pn , for all n > 1, from the Hasse diagram of P1 . The binary n-tuples are
represented by their decimal numbering.
Theorem 3 (Iterative construction of Pn from P1 ). For all n > 1, the
digraph of Pn = {0, . . . , 2n − 1} can be drawn simply by adding to the digraph of
Pn−1 = 0, . . . , 2n−1 − 1 its isomorphic copy 2n−1 +Pn−1 = 2n−1 , . . . , 2n − 1 .
This addition must be performed placing the powers of 2 at consecutive levels of
the Hasse diagram of Pn . Finally, the edges (u v) connecting one vertex u of
Pn−1 with one vertex v of 2n−1 + Pn−1 is given by the set of vertex pairs
{(u, v) / u

v} =

u(10 , 2n−2 + u(10

/ 2n−2 ≤ u(10 ≤ 2n−1 − 1 .
n

Proof. For all n > 1, consider the following partition of {0, 1}

{0, 1}n = {0} × {0, 1}n−1 ∪ {1} × {0, 1}n−1 , i.e.,
{0, . . . , 2n − 1} = 0, . . . , 2n−1 − 1 ∪ 2n−1 , . . . , 2n − 1 .
On one hand, note that according to IOC (Theorem 1), the subposets of Pn ,
n−1

{0} × {0, 1}

n−1

,

and {1} × {0, 1}

,

, are both isomorphic to Pn−1
n−1

in the following sense. For all (u1 , . . . , un−1 ) , (v1 , . . . , vn−1 ) ∈ {0, 1}
(u1 , . . . , un−1 )

(v1 , . . . , vn−1 ) ⇔ (0, u1 , . . . , un−1 )
⇔ (1, u1 , . . . , un−1 )

(0, v1 , . . . , vn−1 )

(1, v1 , . . . , vn−1 ) .

(6)

On the other hand, note that according to Theorem 2, we have for all n > 1
(0, . . . , 0, 1)

(0, . . . , 1, 0)

···

(1, 0, . . . , 0) , i.e., 20

21

2n−1 . (7)

Equations (6) and (7) prove that Pn can be iteratively built up by adding to
the digraph of Pn−1 its isomorphic copy 2n−1 + Pn−1 , placing the powers of
2 at consecutive levels of the Hasse diagram of Pn . Finally, we prove the last
assertion about the edges connecting the two mentioned subposets of Pn . Let
n−1
n−1
≡ Pn−1 , v ∈ {1} × {0, 1}
≡ 2n−1 + Pn−1 and put
u ∈ {0} × {0, 1}
u = (0, u1 , . . . , un−1 ), v = (1, v1 , . . . , vn−1 ) . Using Theorem 2 and taking into
account that the pattern (3) is not possible for matrix Mvu because n ≥ 2, we
have
0 u1 ... un−1
u v ⇔ Mvu =
