Abstract. We consider a data assimilation technique for coupled ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics. The Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) is used to simulate the ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics, and evaluate the performance of the data assimilation
scheme that estimates the ion densities and ﬂow speeds. This estimation
technique is based on the state dependent Riccati equation (SDRE),
which uses a frozen linear dynamics matrix for the time update of the
error covariance and the evaluation of the Kalman ﬁlter gain. We demonstrate the performance of the data assimilation technique on a section of
the ionosphere.

Data Assimilation for Space Weather Prediction

The Sun drives our atmosphere in many ways. The most commonly understood
way is through the heating of the lower atmosphere where sunlight heats the atmosphere causing weather. A similar process occurs in the thermosphere (above
about 60 miles), where the thin atmosphere absorbs sunlight, and the atmosphere
is heated dramatically. Another way in which the Sun aﬀects the upper atmosphere is through the transfer of electromagnetic energy. The Sun’s atmosphere
ﬂows away from it at supersonic speeds and encounters the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld, transferring a signiﬁcant amount of electromagnetic energy to our magnetosphere. This energy ﬂows throughout the magnetosphere until it either leaves
the system or is deposited into the upper atmosphere. This energy takes the
form of strong electromagnetic currents and aurora, that is, the Northern and
Southern lights.
During quiet times, when the Sun’s atmosphere is calm, the heating of the
atmosphere through sunlight is the dominant process. But the Sun sometimes
erupts, sending large amounts of plasma and strong magnetic ﬁelds toward the
Earth in events called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). When CMEs reach the
Earth, they cause the Earth’s magnetosphere to shrink signiﬁcantly, bringing the
aurora to much lower latitudes (sometimes over the United States). During these

disturbed periods, the electromagnetic energy injected into the atmosphere can
become the dominant process, driving the atmosphere in ways that we do not
fully comprehend.
In 1989, the entire province of Quebec, Canada, experienced a power blackout
for 9 hours as a result of a CME. More recently, in October 2003, the so-called
“Halloween storms” caused major distortions of the Earth’s radiation belt and
magnetic ﬁeld, disrupting radio communication systems. These types of solar
storms are known or suspected to have damaged several satellites in orbit around
the Earth, in particular, an AT&T Telestar 401 satellite in 1997, a PanAmSat
Galaxy IV satellite in 1998, and a Kodama communications satellite in 2003 (as
a result of the Halloween storms). One of the primary mechanisms for damage,
especially in the electric grid, is ﬂuctuations in the magnetic ﬁeld, which induce
currents through Faraday’s law.
Solar storms also degrade the accuracy of the Global Positioning System,
which is used for military and civilian positioning systems. This degradation
occurs because the GPS signals travel through the ionosphere, which modiﬁes
their travel time from the satellite to the receiver. If there are strong changes
in the ion density in the ionosphere, then the normal correction for the ionosphere is no longer accurate, causing errors in position. While this navigation
error might not matter to the typical automobile, it has signiﬁcant ramiﬁcations for aircraft during landings in poor visibility as well as for GPS-guided
missiles.
Modeling and prediction of the upper atmosphere and the near-Earth space
environment is generally referred to as space weather. This relatively new ﬁeld is
challenging because of the limited number of measurements in space. However,
the situation has started to improve with increasing awareness of the serious
eﬀects that space weather has on terrestrial and space-based systems.
The present paper describes a Kalman ﬁlter for data assimilation based on
a coupled model of the thermosphere and ionosphere. For this purpose we use
the GITM model [5], which contains various species of both ions and neutrals,
as well as temperatures and winds for both ions and neutrals. The domain of
the model extends from 100 km to approximately 600 km altitude over the entire globe in latitude and longitude. We present preliminary data assimilation
results based on a one-dimensional (vertical) model of the atmosphere. Future
work will involve extensions to 3-dimensional data assimilation, assimilation of
data from incoherent scatter radar, and techniques for using the data assimilation results to redirect the radar during real-time operation, that is, targeted
data assimilation.

Kalman Filtering for GITM

Classical Kalman ﬁltering is based on the linear dynamics and measurements
xk+1 = Ak xk + Bk uk + wk
yk = Ck xk + vk .

Data Assimilation Using the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model

491

The objective is to use the measurements yk to estimate unmeasured state
components. The forecast step consists of the simulation and measurement step
xfk+1 = Ak xda
k + Bk uk ,

ykf = Ck xfk ,

while the data assimilation step is given by the “closed-loop” data-driven update
f
f
xda
k = xk + Kk (yk − yk ).

Here, xfk and xda
k are the forecast estimate and the data assimilation estimate.
The data-injection gain Kk involves the error covariance matrices updated by
Pkda = (I − Kk Ck )Pkf ,

f
Pk+1
= Ak Pkda AT
k + Qk ,

Kk = Pkf CkT (Rk + Ck Pkf CkT )−1 .
Here, Qk and Rk are the covariances of wk and vk , respectively.
Since GITM is nonlinear, nonlinear estimation algorithms are needed. One
approach is the extended Kalman ﬁlter (XKF) in which the nonlinear dynamics
advance the estimate, while the Jacobian of the dynamics propagates the covariance. Alternatively, the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF) [4, 3] is often used. The
size of the ensemble needed to obtain accurate estimates is crucial [4].
An alternative approach is the “frozen-linear” state-dependent Riccati equation approach, wherein the nonlinear dynamics advance the estimate, while an
exact, state-dependent dynamics matrix propagates the pseudo covariance [2].
Hence, we rewrite the nonlinear dynamics
xk+1 = f (xk , k) + B(xk )uk
in the factored form
xk+1 = A(xk , k)xk + B(xk )uk .
This factorization is not unique, and there do not exist general principles for constructing favorable factorizations [1]. However, since no Jacobian exists for ﬁnite
volume schemes with nondiﬀerentiable limiters, the use of an SDRE factorization
seems appropriate. Stability is discussed in [2]. For the system considered in the
present paper, we use an SDRE factorization whose performance is similar to the
performance of an extended Kalman ﬁlter in which the points of discontinuity
are ignored.

Model Description

GITM models the thermosphere and ionosphere using a stretched 3D spherical
grid in latitude and altitude. The number of grid points can be speciﬁed, so
that the resolution is extremely ﬂexible. GITM solves for the neutral densities
of O, O2 , N(2 D), N(2 P), N(4 S), N2 , NO, H, and He; and ion species O+ (4 S),
+
+

O+ (2 D), O+ (2 P), O+
2 , N , N2 , NO , H , and He . By not assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the vertical solver is diﬀerent from other thermospheric codes.
Furthermore, GITM can simulate above a particular location on the earth (onedimensional) or a spherical section around the earth (three-dimensional). Here,
we simulate a one-dimensional grid, and ignore horizontal transport but retain

vertical advection. Three-dimensional source terms are included, which includes
processes such as ion drag.

Neutral Dynamics

In the thermosphere, the neutrals are treated as having individual vertical velocities us , where s denotes the species. The mass density is the sum of the species

where Nj is the log of the number density of the ion species j and vr is ion

We specify ions for advection using (8), while other ion densities are controlled
∂N
by reactions [5] set by r j = 0. O+ is the dominant ion in the low collision region
of the ionosphere, and the most important species to advect [7].

Numerical Schemes

We describe the numerical scheme used in GITM for solving the advection equations and obtain a parametrization A(xk , k) for SDRE-based data assimilation.
4.1

Spatial Discretization for Advection

We perform data assimilation on the ion species, which has greater number
density variation than the neutral species. That is, although we advect both the
neutral and ion species, we use measurements to directly update the estimates
of only the ion species. We describe the numerical scheme used to advect the ion
species as in [5]. Note (8) can be expressed as
∂
∂U

(9)
∂t

where U ∈ R10 is deﬁned by

(11)

and for i = 1, . . . , 10, the ith entry of S ∈ R denotes the source for the ith
ion species. We advect only O+ (4 S); other states in U are updated using only
source terms. It follows from [5] that the time update is given by

where Uj denotes U at the center of the cell j and Uj+ 12 denotes U at the edge
between cells j and j + 1. For all j = 3, . . . , n − 2, we evaluate Uj+ 12 by using
the modiﬁed monotized central limiter [5]. Also, Fj+ 12 is the ﬂux at the edge
between cells j and j + 1 evaluated using the Lax-Friedrichs 2nd-order scheme.
The boundary conditions for the one-dimensional GITM model are U1 (k),
U2 (k), Un−1 (k), and Un (k). Hence, it follows from (12) that the dynamics are

Simulation Results for 1D Advection

Figure 1 uses n=44 cells with xk ∈ R400 . The width Δrj of cell j and time step
ts (k) in (12) are varied to ensure stability. The initial states are determined by
an empirical model relating the neutral densities and temperature to the integrated solar ﬂux approximation(F10.7 ) and activity level(Ap) [5]. Hence, initial
conditions such as initial neutral and ion densities are varied through F10.7 .
The states of the truth model x0 are initialized with F10.7 =210, which is
used throughout the simulation. We assume that noise-free measurements of the
number density of electron and the ion velocity in 40th cell are available so that
yk = C(xk )xk ,

using yk . To do this, the estimator state is initialized with F10.7 = 200 so that
xf0 = x0 . The estimates x
ˆk are obtained by using the SDRE ﬁlter, where Pk is
propagated using P0 = I400 , Qk = I400 , Rk = I2 , Ck = C(xfk ) and Ak = A(xfk );
A(xfk ) is given by (17) with xk replaced by xfk . Although we set F10.7 = 200 at
k = 0 to initialize the estimator, we set F10.7 = 210 for all k > 0.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of O+ at altitudes above the location marked
by ‘+’, obtained by using the truth model initialized with F10.7 =210. The number
density and ion velocity of O+ at cells 30 and 40 of the truth model are shown in
Figure 3. The estimates of ion density and ion velocity obtained from the SDRE
ﬁlter by using measurements from cell 40 are also shown in the same ﬁgures.
Finally, estimates of the ion density and ion velocity of O+ obtained when no
data assimilation is performed are also shown. Since the initial condition of the
estimator xf0 diﬀers from the initial condition of the truth model x0 , the number
density and the ion velocity when no data assimilation is performed diﬀers from
the number density and the ion velocity of the truth model. However, when
measurements are used for data assimilation, the SDRE-based ﬁlter provides
good estimates of the states of the truth model.

by the dotted lines. These estimates diﬀer from the state of the truth model because

after transients due to the erroneous initial conditions, the SDRE ﬁlter asymptotically
achieves correct state estimates.
