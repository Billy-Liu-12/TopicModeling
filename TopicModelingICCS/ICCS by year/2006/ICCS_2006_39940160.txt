Abstract. It is expected that the proportional fair (PF) scheduler will
be used widely in cdma2000 1xEV-DO systems because it maximizes the
sum of each user’s utility, which is given by the logarithm of its average
throughput. In this paper, we address an inﬂuence of the PF scheduler
on the packet transmission delay in base station (BS) and propose an
analytic model.

Introduction

Recent advances in communication technology make appearance of the packetbased cellular systems such as cdma2000 1xEV-DO [1] and UMTS-HSDPA [2].
Being mainly targeted on high-speed data applications that are tolerant of some
packet delay, it is reasonable that their schedulers focus on maximizing the sum
of each user’s utility. A good way of achieving it is to serve the users with
good channel condition in order to utilize the time-varying feature of wireless
channels. This approach increases the system throughput signiﬁcantly. But, some
users can be sacriﬁced since, in wireless environment, users have very diﬀerent
channel condition according to their location.
The proportional fair scheduler [3] is one of the most promising opportunistic
schemes that balance system throughput and user fairness. It is very simple to
implement, and also it is optimal in the sense of maximizing the sum of each
user’s utility that is given by the logarithm of average throughput for elastic trafﬁc. However, owing to its reﬂection on channel state, the scheduler induces some
variation on scheduling delay, and the variation may lead to unstable packet
transmission delay. Since generally the delay variation makes negative inﬂuence
on the performance of transport layer protocol and application, it is very important to have an accurate delay model that describes the delay variation. From
that reason, we propose a packet transmission delay model in BS with PF scheduler in this paper. Also, we show the comparison of the analytic model and the
simulation result using NS-2 [4].

Scheduling Delay Analysis

The wireless networks sometimes have a quite long delay because a base station
may have many tasks to reduce the impact of the errors such as Forward Error
Correction (FEC), interleaving, retransmission, and so on. In this section, we
show an analytic model for BS delay, which is simpliﬁed with only the scheduling
delay and the retransmission delay.
2.1

1 User Case

First, we build the model with 1 user. The user has the packet size of T bytes
and is able to transmit X bytes whenever the scheduling slot is allocated. For
example, if T is 1500 and X is 100 in constant, the time for servicing the packet
is 15 slots. But when X changes depending on the channel state, the analysis
comes to be more diﬃcult.
For convenience of the analysis, we assume that X has an exponential distribution with average m (actually this assumption is exactly correct when the
transmission rate linearly increases in proportion as SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) on the Rayleigh channel). When we denote the data size that is successfully
transmitted in ﬂow i as Xi , the number of slots that is required to service the
N
packet is N (T ). N (T ) is minimum N that satisﬁes i=1 Xi ≥ T . Analyzing this
problem as the Poisson counting process, we can see that N (T )− 1 has a Poisson
T
.
distribution with both average and variance m
We obtain the required number of slots to service a packet as above. However,
owing to wireless channel error, the transmission does not always make a success
even if BS successfully transmits the packet. In this model, we denote the error
rate of each ﬂow as p and assume that the error rate is independent of the transmission rate. At this time, to transmit the packet successfully in ﬂow i, actually
Yi slots are taken. Because Yi follows the discrete probability distribution with
p

P r(Yi = n) = pn−1 (1 − p), we get E(Yi ) = 1−p
and V ar(Yi ) = (1−p)
2.
Actual number of slots to transmit a packet is given by S =
we can obtain its average and variance as follows.
E(S) = E{N (T )}E(Yi ) = (

K Users Case

Let’s consider the case of K users. We assume that each user has a packet to
transmit, and the packet size, T , and channel state are same in every user. Also
assuming that the scheduler chooses a user and, only after transmitting the user’s
one packet, selects another user, we analyze the packet transmission time of the

last-selected user. When the transmission time of k − th selected user is denoted
K
as Dk , our ﬁnding time is D = D1 + D2 + ... + Dk = k=1 Dk . By applying
Central limit theorem [5], we approximate D to a Gaussian distribution with
the average K · E(Dk ) and the variance K · V ar(Dk ).

Finally D follows the Gaussian distribution with the average K( m

and the variance K( m + 1)(1 + p)(1 − p) .
For example, when we consider the case of T =1500, m=100, K=50, and
p=0.1, the packet transmission time of the last selected user is as follows1 . It is
necessary to keep in mind that the inter-packet interval of a user comes from
the scheduling delay.

– Constant rate with no channel error: 750 slots.
– Variable rate with no channel error: 800 slots with 50%.
– Variable rate with channel error, p: 889 slots with 50%.
In this model, the scheduler services a user’s packet sequentially but real
PF scheduler services several users’ packet little by little, depending on the
channel state. Thus, every user ﬁnishes the packet transmission at similar time
due to their mixed service time while the average rate of the allocated slots is
so high as to have a better possibility that reduces the entire transmission time.
Consequently every user has a similar ﬁnish time with the ”last” user.

Simulation Result

To validate the model, we perform simulation studies using NS-2. Some key
conﬁguration variables are summarized in Table 1.
The conﬁguration values make average m=100, which is used in examples for
our analysis. To remove the impact of transport layer protocol, we used UDP
and CBR application. Simulation run time is 200 sec, and about 8000 packets
are gathered. The following Fig.1 shows the distributions of PF scheduling delay.
Respectively, Fig.1(a) is a histogram of ”variable rate with no channel error,”
and Fig.1(b) is a histogram of ”variable rate with 10% channel errors”. Also,
cumulative lines are drawn in both cases.

In ”no channel error” case, we get 775 slots with average, which are taken for
about 1.29 sec. And, there are above 800 slots for 48.86% of packets. In ”10%
channel errors” case, average 880 slots are observed for about 1.46 sec. Also,
there are above 889 slots for 48.47% of packets.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed an analytic delay model for PF scheduler. Although
the model includes only the scheduling delay and the retransmission delay, the
simpliﬁcation does not undermine the inter-packet interval of a user. In addition, NS-2 simulation result shows that the analytic model approximates to the
simulation model.
