Abstract. In recent years, there are many researches for routing lookup.
Most of them can achieve high average search throughput for IPv4, but
they are slow in the updating speed and cannot suit to 128 bits IPv6
address even in hardware architecture. This paper proposed a routing
lookup system which contains an ASIC of routing lookup table and oﬀchip memory sets. In the performance analysis, 91.89 % routing entries
of the routing table can be searched in one memory access, and the worst
case about 10 % needs two memory accesses. The routing lookup system
approaches 213.4 Mlps (109.26 Gb/s). It is enough to satisfy the high
speed link OC-768 (40 Gb/s) with 150000 routing entries.

Introduction

In recent years, there are many researches for routing lookup. [1, 2] create routing
lookup table with trie. [3] proposed hierarchical hardware architecture for IPv4
routing lookup. They can achieve high average search throughput for IPv4, but
they cannot suit to 128 bits IPv6 address. [4, 5, 6] proposed routing lookup with
CAM, and all match action only needs one clock cycle. But it needs special
mechanisms to solve the sorting problem and expensive, especially TCAM.
This paper proposes a routing lookup system which contains an ASIC and
oﬀ-chip RAM for IPv6. The routing scheme is based on the preﬁx length distribution of 6Net routing tables. In the proposed system, the lookup speed with
281.69 Mlps can satisfy the requirement of OC-768, and only needs 20.04 KB
TCAM, 10.24 KB BCAM, and 29.29 MB RAM for 150000 routing entries.

System Architecture

Figure 1 shows the system architecture which composed of an ASIC and a memory set stores routing table. The oﬀ-chip RAM is with two hierarchical levels.
First level is composed of 3 hash tables, and second level is a pure SRAM table. The hash tables store routing entries with preﬁx equal to 32, 48 and 64
respectively.
The ASIC has the complete functions, including inserting, searching, updating
and deleting. Moreover, it focus on 1-64 bits of IPv6 address (network ID).

80 % hit ratio is guaranteed on the chip. The CAM is used as an on-chip memory
for the fast search in the ASIC, and cache replacement algorithm and FIFO are
used.

Hash Scheme

Table 1 shows the entropy of various hash functions by diﬀerent schemes. The
simulation trace is based on TANET[7] network. It consists of 7.66157 million
entries in a period of one hour, and there are 43867 distinct destination addresses.
The hash functions are used to simulate Bit Extraction, Fletch Checksum, XOR
Folding, and CRC.
Table 1 shows that CRC is the best scheme for the hash function, but it requires complex computation. The XOR folding is also an excellent hash function
and simple to be implemented in hardware, so it is used in our scheme.

Cache Replacement Algorithm

When a cache misses, the new referenced data needs to be inserted into the
cache table. The simulation analyzed ﬁve cache replacement algorithms. These

ﬁve algorithms are FIFO [8], LRU [8], mLRU[9], SF-LRU[10], and LFU [11]. The
simulation results are shown in Table 2.
In the simulation, SF-LRU and LFU have good performance. But SF-LRU
and LFU need counters to record the last reference time and sorting action is too
complex in hardware. FIFO has good performance and 81.19 % hit ratio with
1024 entries. It is enough in network traﬃc. It is simple for hardware design and
only needs one register to record the next CAM address.

Eﬃciency Analysis

CCUEE SOC Lab proposes a PF-CDPD CAM [12]. Its clock period can approach
3.3 ns when CAM size is 1024 × (64 + 8). We assume the ideal oﬀ-chip clock
period can approach the ASIC’s speed, i.e., 3.3 ns. We refer to the actual SRAM
clock period (5 ns) and CAM clock period (10 ns). The analysis results of lookup
speed in ideal case is shown Table 3. The lookup speeds can satisfy the OC-768
requirement. The best ideal lookup speed is 213.4 Mlps with 80 % hit ratio.

Conclusion

The IPv6 routing lookup system is proposed with a routing lookup ASIC and a
memory set. The scheme is based on the preﬁx length distribution of 6Net routing tables. The ﬁrst level in the proposed routing table can cover about 91.89 %
routing entries. The ASIC has the complete routing lookup functions: insert,
search, update, and delete. A FIFO is used as cache replacement algorithm in
the proposed architecture by using a CAM with 1024 entries. It can guarantee
80 % hit ratio, so the speed can approach 213.4 Mlps and satisfy the requirement of OC-768. The system only needs 20.04 KB TCAM, 10.24 KB BCAM,
and 29.29 MB RAM for 150000 routing entries. Table 4 shows the comparison
with the related works.
