Abstract. An Analytic and graphic model of a unilateral external fixator and
bone system is presented to simulate and visualize the pre-operative planning of
three-dimensional adjustments of the fixator joints in osteotomy. An analytic
model was developed as a rigid body linkage system, and kinematic chain loop
equations were utilized in the adjustment analysis to obtain the necessary rotations and translations at each joint of the fixator to correct bone deformity at the
fracture site. Corrections of various deformities, combining various rotations
and translations, were simulated to validate the models developed. The presented models achieve the goal of using computer-aided pre-operative planning
and intra-operative execution of an osteotomy to correct malalignment and joint
dysfunction.

1 Introduction
Knee osteotomy has been widely recognized as a treatment method for unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee [1–5]. This method has been used more frequently in
relatively young and active patients with early degenerative changes in the joint [3].
The underlying principles for osteotomy are sound, but one of the causes of undesirable outcome of the treatment relates to a lack of knowledge based pre-operative planning and inadequate execution of the procedure as planned [6–8].
In the pre-operative planning stage for osteotomy, one crucial factor in obtaining
good clinical results is the accurate determination of femoral-tibial alignment in order
to redistribute joint contact pressure [6, 9–11]. Achieving the desired corrective angle
is also difficult and unpredictable in preventing deformity recurrence. To accomplish
accurate osteotomy, an examination of three-dimensional deformity, initial osteotomy
plane orientation, and subsequent angular and translational adjustment, taking into
account bone segment fixation stability must be carefully planned and executed.
External fixation has been widely used in bone segment stabilization following osteotomy [12–14]. External fixation has a distinct advantage in its ability to directly
adjust the bone deformity intra-operatively in one setting or post-operatively adjust
bone segments through gradual distraction at the osteotomy site. Furthermore, it alP.M.A. Sloot et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2003, LNCS 2660, pp. 771–778, 2003.

lows continuous monitoring of bone and joint alignment to avoid residual deformity in
rotation and translation. To the author’s knowledge, however, there has been no study
conducted to evaluate the existing fixator’s ability to achieve deformity correction
based on certain application configurations and also determine the precise fixator joint
adjustments in order to execute the correction plan accurately.
The objective of this study was to simulate a three-dimensional knee osteotomy of
different bone and joint deformities using a unilateral external fixator to accomplish
the required alignment correction. In order to determine the necessary fixator joint
adjustments, the bone segments, the osteotomy site and the external fixator were modeled as a multi-link kinematic mechanism. The associated kinematic analysis under
given bone deformities and fixator application configurations provided the degree of
translation and rotation to be performed in each fixator joint in order to precisely correct a bone deformity. A computer graphic model of both the fixator and tibia were
developed to visualize and validate the analysis results and to evaluate the osteotomy
execution plan under external immobilization and adjustment. The presented technology assures the precise execution of the desired deformity correction.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Mathematical and Computer Graphic Model
®

A unilateral external fixator for deformity correction (DynaExtor , Bkmeditech, Korea) was used in this analysis. The fixator model is composed of eight pins inserted
into the bones, a central telescoping rod, two pin clamps, two rotational rod clamps,
and two connecting bodies which have two revolute rotations, respectively (Fig. 1).
The analytical representation of the motion of each link of the fixator and the bone
segments can be expressed as a kinematic linkage system interconnected by five
revolute and one prismatic joints, thus having 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The central rod of the fixator has a range of 5 cm of compression/distraction, and the rotational clamps have unlimited rotation along the long axis of its body. Both the distal
connecting body and the proximal connecting body reach their full range of
o
varus/valgus angulation at 45 of flexion/extension. In the model, all joints of the
fixator begin in their neutral positions, with the exception of the lower revolute joint,
o
which is rotated -10 in y-direction. Other geometric dimensions were measured and
defined to facilitate the kinematic analysis (Fig. 1).
The bone was modeled as a cylinder, and the osteotomy cutting-plane was defined
at diaphyseal area of the bone. The simple frontal plane angular correction was accomplished by rotating the distal bone segment with respect to the AP axis through the
medial edge of the proximal bone segment in the frontal plane based on the specified
wedge angle. The proximal and distal bone segments were modeled as two rigid bodies, with the distal bone segment fixed to the origin of the global coordinate system.
Other three-dimensional osteotomy corrections including translation were defined as
the input data specified by three rigid body Eulerian angle rotations and three translations, which were to be achieved by adjusting the fixator joints. The computer graphic

model of the bone-fixator system was developed using the software SolidWorks
(Solidworks, Concord, MA, USA) in order to visualize the computed results of joint
rotation and translation required to achieve the desired osteotomy correction.

2.2 Inverse Kinematics Analysis
In order to define deformity parameters between the two bone segments, a 4 x 4 homogeneous transformation matrix was utilized to express the kinematic loop equations
of the fixator-tibia system [15]. The rotational sequences at the fracture site follows
the x-y’-z" Euler-angle system [15]. The global coordinate system was fixed to the
distal segment of the tibia (Fig. 1). All local joint coordinate systems were defined

identically to the global coordinate system. In the mathematical analysis, Tp is the
transformation matrix from the proximal tibial segment to the distal segment, was
expressed by the matrix or loop equation shown below:

the central telescoping rod. After substituting the unknown fracture ( Tp) and fixator
geometric parameters into the transformation matrices, the six unknown joint variables, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 and to, can be determined by solving the matrix Eq. (1), where, r1,
r2, r3, r4 and r5 are the revolute variables, and to is the translational variables, respectively [15] (Fig. 1). The resulting systems of non-linear equations were solved using
TM
the nonlinear least square optimization method (MATLAB , Mathworks, MA, USA)
[15]. In the optimization process, the limit of range in each joint was set as a constraint equation.
2.3 Simulation and Graphic Validation
To validate the presented analysis method, a correction of 10° varus deformity was
simulated using graphic animation. In addition, anterior (-y-axis) translation, medial
(-x-axis) translation, bone lengthening (z-translation), external rotation (z-rotation),
and flexion (x-rotation) of the proximal segment in reference to the distal segment
were combined with the varus deformity correction in order to fully illustrate the 3-D
fixator adjustability and the analysis method used to achieve accurate alignment correction during treatment. Based on analysis results and graphic animation, the deformity correction planning process can be clearly visualized and evaluated.

3 Results
In order to demonstrate the adjustability of the fixator and the wide range of osteotomy options in 3-D space, both simple and complex malalignment cases were considered. Computer graphic models of the fixator and the bone segments were used to
illustrate their pre-adjustment and corrected configurations.
In the case of a 10° varus deformity, the solution of the fixator joint variables for a
®
o
closed wedge osteotomy site was obtained for the DynaExtor fixator, as (r1 = 0 , r2 =
o
o
o
o
5.8 , r3 = 0 , r4 = 0 , r5 = 4.2 , to = 10.8mm) (Table 1). By rotating the revolute joints
associated with r2 and r5 along the y-axis and translating to, the fixator closes the
wedge gap perfectly. The upper and lower bounds imposed on the rotational and prismatic fixator joints based on the fixator design constraints improve the solution convergence. According to the analysis results, the graphic simulation showed a perfect
reduction of the wedge gap achieved by the above changes in the fixator joint variables (Fig. 2b).
In the case of a 10° varus deformity with 5 mm medial translation of the proximal
segment in reference to distal osteotomy surface, the resulting solutions of the fixator

o
o
joint variables for the osteotomy site were: r1 = 0 , r2 = 4.2 , r3 = 0 , r4 = 0 , r5 = 5.8 , to
= 11.5mm (Table 1). When knee joint laxity needs to be increased, additional medial
translation can be incorporated into the osteotomy in order to balance the knee ligaments. In this case, the same two revolute joints, which were involved in pure osteotomy reduction, now functioned to perform combined rotation and translation (Fig. 2c).

correction processes for different deformities and planning using the presented techniques
would be useful before the intra-operation to obtain the accurate execution results

In the case of a 10° varus deformity with 5mm bone lengthening, the solutions of

the fixator joint variables at the osteotomy site were: r1 = 0 , r2 =5.9 , r3 = 0 , r4 = 0 , r5

model shows the 5 mm of gap at the osteotomy site (Fig. 2d).
In the case of a 10° varus deformity with 5mm anterior translation at the osteotomy

site, the solutions of the fixator joint variables at the osteotomy site were: r1 = 1.5 , r2

=5.8 , r3 = 0.1 , r4 = -1.5 , r5 = 4.7 , to = 11.1mm (Table 1). In order to obtain the anterior translation of the bone segments, the two revolute joints r1 and r4 were rotated in
the direction of X-axis, with the same magnitudes but opposite signs. Fig. 2e shows
the lateral view (x-axis) of the fixator-bone system to validate the anterior translation
of the system.
The case of a 10° varus deformity with 10° external rotation at the osteotomy site
required all fixator joints to move significantly in order to perform the correction: r1 =

3.7 , r2 = 8 , r3 = -9.6 , r4 = -3.4 , r5 = 2.6 , to = 11.4mm, (Table 1). This result clearly

illustrates the capability of the fixator and the ability of the analysis software to generate 3-D movement at Knee osteotomy site. The Fig. 2f shows perfect adjustment of
the bone segments as well as the axial rotations between the proximal and the distal
osteotomy planes.
In the combined rotational deformity case with 10° varus and 10° flexion, the soluo
tion of the fixator joint variables osteotomy site were determined to be r1 = 5.1 , r2

o
o
o
=5.8 , r3 = -0.4 , r4 = 4.9 , r5 = 4.1 , to = 10.8mm (Table 1). To obtain the flexion effect
between the bone segments, the two rotational joints in the medial-lateral direction, r1
o
and r4, together rotated about 10 . In the graphic model, the rotations are clearly demonstrated between the two segments in the lateral view (Fig. 2g). With the use of an
appropriate planning program that can define the correction required in all planes, the
presented analysis technique can determine the precise adjustment required of each
joint to achieve the specified osteotomy.

4 Discussion
Unicompartmental osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a common disorder due to the
weight bearing, high-mobility and stability required of the joint [1–4]. Altered limb
alignment in a knee with unicompartmental arthritis causes the load to shift towards
the affected compartment, thus causing further joint deformity and degenerative
changes. Therefore, joint alignment and loading redistribution are considered to be the
key biomechanical justifications for knee osteotomy.

Despite the many advantages of knee osteotomy, it has not been favored as the
treatment of choice even when clinical indications are favorable for such treatment
because of several possible complications. Improper pre-operative planning and poor
execution of the surgical plan have been identified as causes of deformity and pain
recurrence [7]. In order to obtain good results, computer-assisted 3-D preoperative
planning and execution of knee osteotomy is necessary [6, 9–12]. If an external fixator is used as the adjustment and stabilization device in a knee osteotomy, gradual and
precise correction of the residual deformity at the osteotomy site can be accomplished
by rotating and translating the fixator joints gradually on an adjustment plan.
When flexional/extensional deformities are combined with internal/external rotational malalignments, additional factors must be considered during preoperative planning, execution, and postoperative residual deformity readjustment. During osteotomy,
there is a possibility of the tilting of the osteotomy line in the anterior/posterior direction due to the difficulty of saw blade angle control [8]. To maintain sagittal plane
orientation of the tibial plateau it is important to avoid residual flexion/extension deformity of the tibia, since joint articular surface motion is improved when the normal
posterior tilt of the tibial plateau is recovered. Furthermore, an intended internal/external rotation of the foot can be generated when the axis of the osteotomy
closing is not perpendicular to the frontal plane. In addition to the intra-operative technical difficulties of knee osteotomy, rotational deformities from cerebral palsy or a
congenital disease in which 3-D osteotomy is needed have been reported [16]. The
current analysis software and graphic models can facilitate correction of all deformities at any level of the long bone by providing accurate and reliable corrections
through fixator joints or robotic arms both in one-step correction and internal fixation
or in gradual correction through callus distraction under external fixation.
The results of current analysis and simulation show that knee osteotomy can be
achieved by adjusting a combination of translations and rotations of the fixator joints.
Furthermore, the current analysis and simulation techniques can be used to determine
the adjustment capability of the current design of any fixator, evaluate its performance
during surgical treatment, and review its clinical application in individual patients.
These kinds of tools can also provide the guidelines for a desirable biomechanical
environment at fracture sites that enhances fracture union and bone maturation after
lengthening. By integrating its use with image-guided and robotics-assisted tools, a
fully controlled, 3-D, computer-aided osteotomy surgery and rehabilitation procedure
can be established.

5 Summary
This paper presents a kinematic analysis and a graphic simulation tool for osteotomy
under external fixation for complex 3-D bone deformities. Using the developed analysis tool, the required amount of the rotations and translations of the fixator joints were
determined to reduce the given deformities in osteotomy with combined 3-D rotations
and translations at the osteotomy site. In addition, the graphic model of the bonefixator system developed in this study demonstrates its capabilities in validating analy-

sis results and simulating the pre-operative planning of osteotomy. Furthermore, these
tools can be used to evaluate the existing planning methods of osteotomy, enhancing
their performance and facilitating changes in the design configuration for the external
fixator.
