Abstract. It is known that a lot of mathematical calculations must
be processed during a practical use of exact and approximate methods,
which are designed to analyze random phenomena in nonlinear dynamic
systems. The present paper describes some schemes of such analysis.
These schemes expect an application of a computer algebra system (CAS)
Mathematica v. 4.1 [9], which is a very powerful and suitable tool for
above mentioned topic. At ﬁrst, relations between moments, cumulants,
and quasi-moments are derived. Further, a problem concerning the seach
of polynomial stochastic potentials is considered. Necessary conditions
and relations are obtained to solve the last problem. All calculations
of appropriate expressions were produced with the help of our package
ProbRel and diﬀerent procedures.

Introduction

The analysis of random processes in nonlinear dynamic systems is a very important topic for theory and practice. The necessity of such analysis is urgent
for studying various phenomena: (i) a ﬂight of vehicles under an action of atmospheric turbulence; (ii) traﬃc on a rough surface; (iii) high-altitude vibrations
of structures under wind and seismic attacks; (iv) a rolling of ships due to a
rough-sea etc.
Solving a signiﬁcant number of practical problems, it is possible to assume
that a random vector process x ∈ X ⊂ Rn describing a status of an object
being studied, a phase vector, satisﬁes a set of stochastic diﬀerential equations
(SD Eqs.) in the Stratonovich sense [1,2]
dx(t) = f (x, t)dt + G(x, t)dw(t) ,

{gij (·, ·)} : Rn × [0, ∞) → Rn × Rm is a deterministic matrix-function; T is
a symbol of the transposition.
The main stochastic characteristics of the vector x are the probability density function (PDF) p(x, t); the transition probability density function(TPDF)
p(x, t|y, τ ); the characteristic function Θ(λ, t); moments mα = M[xα ] and

µα = M[(x−M[x])α ], where α = {α1 , α2 , ..., αn } is a multi-index, αi ≥ 0; cumulants κα ; covariance functions Kij (t1 , t2 ), and spectral density functions sij (ω).
Among moments the ﬁrst ones are highlighted such as mean values mi = xi ;
variances σi2 ; mixed moments mij and µij of second order. In the case t1 = t2 = t
we denote Kij as Dij (t), where Dij = M xi − mi xj − mj are elements of
the matrix D of covariances, and M · stands for the mathematical expectation.
It is well known [1,2] that the TPDF p(x, t|y, τ ) satisﬁes the Fokker - Planck
- Kolmogorov equation (FPK Eq.)
∂p(x, t|y, τ )

The PDF p(x, t) satisﬁes Eq.(1.2) too but with the initial condition p(x, t0 ) =

If t tends to inﬁnity, then under certain conditions there is a steady-state
PDF ps (x), which satisﬁes the stationary FPK Eq.
Lps (x) = 0 ,

a = a(x) ,

B = B(x) .

This solution does not depend on the initial distribution.

Nowadays there is a signiﬁcant number of exact and approximate methods
intended for an analysis of random phenomena. But to perform most of them,
time consuming mathematical calculations such as transformations, reductions of
similar terms, diﬀerentiations, integrations etc., are required. Computer algebra
is a well-known tool for diﬀerent sciences. Below we demonstrate an application
of the package Mathematica for algebraic manipulations during a solution of
some random study problems.

Relations for Characteristics

An application of diﬀerent probability methods demands very often to use some
characteristics of random variables such as moments, cumulants, and quasimoments. For example, these characteristics are used to neglect inﬁnite sets
of OD Eqs. for moments during an exploration of nonlinear dynamical systems
eﬀected by random ﬂuctuations if the quasi-Gaussian or cumulant closure is
exploited. In practice, it is necessary to know simple relations among above
mentioned values. A construction of relations for mixed moments, cumulants,
and quasi-moments is considered in this section.
2.1

Building of Relations

To derive the dependencies, we use the technique from Ref.[7]. Suppose all required characteristics of a random vector x exist and formal manipulations with
power series are permissible.
Below we use the following multi-index notation:
α = {α1 , α2 , ..., αn } ,

β = {β1 , β2 , ..., βn } ,

k1 α + k2 β = {k1 α1 + k2 β1 , ..., k1 αn + k2 βn } ,

|β| = β1 + β2 + ... + βn .

(2.1)

βn =0

Here δkj is the Kronecker delta; Cqs is equal to s!/q!(s − q)!.
In addition, let x = {x1 , x2 , ..., xn } be a random vector, p(x) be the probability density of x, and Θ(u) be the characteristic function:
n

,

xi ui

Θ(u) = M exp i
k=1

√
where i is equal to −1; u = {u1 , u2 , ..., un }.
Transforming and generalizing relations from Refs.[3,4,8], we get the function
Θ(u) in the following forms:

Θ(u) =

Application of Relations

To use in practice the relations derived, a Mathematica code package ProbRels
has been implemented. Some aims of this package construction are the following:
(i) to calculate an indeﬁnite integral, where the integrant is a product of a
multi-dimensional Gaussian probability density and polynomial, in a symbolic
mode by computer. For example, such integration is necessary for realization
of the Gaussian approximation method for a stochastic analysis of nonlinear
dynamic systems;
(ii) to derive relations for the quasi-Gaussian and cumulant closure in above
mentioned analysis.
Below we demonstrate the use of the package. Here there are Mathematica
commands for calls of procedures from the package and results of calculations.
Example 2.1. If we need to ﬁnd the mean value of the expression 3x21 x2 +
4x1 x2 x3 − x51 x3 , where {x1 , x2 , x3 } is a vector with a Gaussian distribution, then
we may call the IntGauss procedure as
IntGauss[{x1 , x2 , x3 }, 3x21 x2 + 4x1 x2 x3 − x51 x3 , {m1 , m2 , m3 },
{{d11 , d12 , d13 }, {d21 , d22 , d23 }, {d31 , d32 , d33 }}]
where the third parameter of the procedure is the vector of mean values and the
forth one is the matrix of covariances. The result is
−15 d211 d13 + 6 d12 m1 + 4 d23 m1 − 30 d11 d13 m21
−5 d13 m41 + 3 d11 m2 + 4 d13 m2 + 3 m21 m2
+4 d12 m3 − 15 d211 m1 m3 − 10 d11 m31 m3 − m51 m3 + 4 m1 m2 m3
Note we have taken into account here that the matrix of covariances is a
symmetric one.
Example 2.2. If we need to produce the Gaussian closure of the expression
3x21 x2 + 4x1 x2 x3 − x51 x3 to exclude moments with orders more than 3, where
{x1 , x2 , x3 } is a vector with the vector α of mean values and the matrix {dij } of
covariances, then we may call the QuasiGauss procedure as
QuasiGauss[{x1 , x2 , x3 }, 3x21 x2 + 4x1 x2 x3 − x51 x3 ,
{m1 , m2 , m3 }, {{d11 , d12 , d13 }, {d21 , d22 , d23 }, {d31 , d32 , d33 }}, 3, ”α”]
The result is
−15 d211 d13 − 10 d11 d13 m1 2 − d13 m41 − 8 d211 m1 m3 − 2 d11 m31 m3 + 4 α1,1,1
−7 d11 m1 α2,0,1 − m31 α2,0,1 + 3 α2,1,0 − 2 d13 m1 α3,0,0
Example 2.3. If we need to produce the cumulant closure of the expression
3x21 x2 + 4x1 x2 x3 − x51 x3 to exclude moments with orders more than 3, where
{x1 , x2 , x3 } is a vector with the vector α of mean values and the matrix {dij } of
covariances, then we may call the CumulClosure procedure as
CumulClosure[{x1 , x2 , x3 }, 3x21 x2 + 4x1 x2 x3 − x51 x3 , 3, ”α”, ”λ”]

Example 2.4. If we need to express moments of a random vector in terms
of cumulants, then we write
MomCum[3, 3, ”α”, ”λ”]
Here the ﬁrst number is a dimension of this random vector and the second value
is the major order of moments considered. A part of the result is the following
α0,0,3 = λ30,0,1 + 3 λ0,0,1 λ0,0,2 + λ0,0,3
α0,2,1 = λ0,0,1 λ20,1,0 + 2 λ0,1,0 λ0,1,1 + λ0,0,1 λ0,2,0 + λ0,2,1
α1,1,1 = λ0,0,1 λ0,1,0 λ1,0,0 + λ0,1,1 λ1,0,0 + λ0,1,0 λ1,0,1 + λ0,0,1 λ1,1,0 + λ1,1,1
Using procedure CumMom we can express cumulants of a random vector in
terms of moments in the same way.

Polynomial Stochastic Potentials

Systems with polynomial coeﬃcients of drift and diﬀusion arise in a lot of
problems. A calculation of the steady-state PDF ps (x) for the system of such
type can be reduced to determination of the steady-state stochastic potential
φ(x) ≡ − ln ps (x). This potential satisﬁes the equation
˜ 2 φ −C = 0 .
˜ φ ≡K
˜ 1 φ +K
K

(3.1)

In a number of cases the function φ can be represented by a polynomial in the
variables x1 , x2 ..., xn .
Usually it is very hard to obtain an explicit form of such polynomial but
some conclusions can be made.
At ﬁrst, let us notice that the polynomial φ exists if

deg(Bi ) = deg(ai ) = deg(fi ) ,

deg(C) = deg
i=1

∂ai
∂xi

,

(3.2)

where deg(h) = {deg1 (h), ..., degn (h)} and degs (h) denotes the degree of polynomial h in xs .
Below, on the basis of this notion we build expressions connecting the degrees
of the function φ in xs and the coeﬃcients of FPK Eq.(1.2). These relations allow
to close a formally constructed inﬁnite system of algebraic equations satisﬁed by
coeﬃcients of Maclaurin-series expansion for the potential φ.

where α is a multi-index, Kis ≥ 1, Mijs ≥ 0, s = 1, 2..., n. To solve Eq. (3.1), let
us apply the method of indeterminate coeﬃcients and represent the function φ
by the way

Let us remark that: (i) the numbers Ns must be an even integer; (ii) the
coeﬃcients φα are equal to zero for all multi-indices α = {α1 , α2 ..., αn } such
that αs ≥ Ns and α1 + ... + αs−1 + αs+1 + ... + αn > 0 (s = 1, 2, ..., n); (iii)
φ∗ → +∞ as |x| → +∞.
To select correctly the degree N of the polynomial φ∗ , it is necessary to
˜ φ∗ . This polynomial is
establish a balance of senior degrees of polynomial K
obtained after substitution of (3.3)-(3.5) in the left-hand side of Eq.(3.1). It is
˜ φ∗ is that a coeﬃcient at
clear that a necessary condition of vanishing for K
˜ φ∗ term of degree N should be a sum of two addends at
any included in K
least. Thus now the main problem is to determine the degrees of polynomials
˜ 1 φ∗ and K
˜ 2 φ∗ on the basis of deg(fi ), deg(gij ), and deg(φ∗ ).

To solve this problem, we write the following chain of equalities
degs (ai ) = Kis ,

degs (bij ) = max Miks + Mjks ,

degs (Aij ) = degs (bij ) = max Miks + Mjks ,

2Ms∗ + Ns = Ks∗ + 1 ,

s = 1, 2..., n .

(3.6)

Example 3.1. Let the functions fi be linear, the coeﬃcients gij be constant
(i = 1, 2, ..., n, j = 1, 2, ..., m). Then Ks∗ = 1, Ms∗ = 0, and Ns = 2. If we select
proper signs of φα , then the result corresponds to a stochastic potential of a
Gaussian type.
Example 3.2. Let us state an inverse problem, i.e., what must relations between Ks∗ and Ms∗ be for existence of a Gaussian potential? The answer following
from equality (3.6) is Ks∗ = 2Ms∗ + 1, Ms∗ ≥ 0.
We have made use of this answer to construct a few stochastic systems with
Gaussian potentials. The results of calculations for φ = φ0 x2 are shown below:
M∗ = 1
f0 = 12 g0 g1 ,
f2 = −2φ0 g0 g1 ,
M∗ = 2
f0 = 12 g0 g1 ,
f2 = 12 (−4φ0 g0 g1 + 3g1 g2 ) ,
f4 = −2φ0 g1 g2 ,
M∗ = 3
f0 = 12 g0 g1 ,
f2 = 12 (−4φ0 g0 g1 + 3g1 g2 + 3g0 g3 ) ,
f4 = 12 (−4φ0 g1 g2 − 4φ0 g0 g3 + 5g2 g3 ) ,
f6 = −2φ0 g2 g3 ,

f1 = 12 (−2φ0 g02 + g12 ) ,
f3 = −φ0 g12 ,
f1 = 12 (−2φ0 g02 + g12 + 2g0 g2 ) ,

= 12 (−2φ0 g22 − 4φ0 g1 g3 + 3g32 ) ,
= −φ0 g32 .

Example 3.3. Let’s construct a stochastic system with the potential φ =
(x21 + x22 )2 − (x21 + x22 ) if there are only additive noises.
Here n = 2, N1 = N2 = 4. Suppose m = 2, the matrix G is diagonal,
G = diag(g1 , g2 ). Then M1∗ = M2∗ = 0 and from equality (3.6) we obtain K1∗ =
K2∗ = 3, i.e.,
3 3−p

The result of calculations is as follows

f110 = g1 ,

We see that some coeﬃcients are indeﬁnite. Let C1 and C2 be arbitrary constant
values. Then the functions fi take the form
f1 = g12 x1 − C1 x2 − 2g12 x1 (x21 + x22 ) + C2 (x21 x2 + x32 ) ,
f2 = C1 x1 + g22 x2 − 2g22 x2 (x21 + x22 ) − C2 (x31 + x1 x22 ) .

Conclusions

Above we have brieﬂy described some algorithms for solution of problems, which
arise during a study of eﬀects in nonlinear dynamic systems subjected by random
ﬂuctuations, and the technique for implementation of these algorithms on the
basis of the Mathematica package. The considered and some other examples such
as an analysis of rotation of rigid body, an examination of stochastic systems
with delay, a study of random phenomena in continuous medium, an estimation
of a robot manipulator precision and so on, specify a utility and an eﬃciency
of such implementation, especially in the frame of development of compound
packages consisting of diﬀerent software parts [6].
