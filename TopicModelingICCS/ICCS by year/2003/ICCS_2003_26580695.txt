Abstract. We propose an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) recognition method combined the genetic algorithms (GA) and the artificial neural network (ANN).
Spontaneous EEG and auditory ERP data recorded from a single site in 16
early AD patients and 16 age-matched normal subjects were used. We made a
feature pool including 88 spectral, 28 statistical and 2 nonlinear characteristics
of EEG and 10 features of ERP. The combined GA/ANN was applied to find
the dominant features automatically from the feature pool, and the selected
features were used as a network input. The recognition rate of the ANN fed by
this input was 81.9% for the untrained data set. These results lead to the conclusion that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for an early detection of the AD. This approach could be extended to a reliable classification
system using EEG recording that can discriminate between groups.

1 Introduction
A number of quantitative EEG analysis have been used to detect the brain’s functional changes in the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigators have extracted specific
quantitative features from the EEG, which would be characteristics for each stage of
this disease. Various spectral and nonlinear analyses were employed and some progress has been established [1-2].
To the spectral nature of the EEG changes in the AD, there is a general agreement
that the earliest changes are an increase in theta and a decrease in beta mainly over
1.

parieto-occipital area, followed by a decrease of alpha activity [3-4]. Delta activity
increases later in the course of disease [5]. Claus et al.(1998) reported that a slowing
spectral EEG could predict the rate of subsequent cognitive and functional decline in
the AD, using multiple linear regression analysis [6]. Intra- and inter-hemispheric
EEG coherence, which is considered to be a measure of the cortical synchronization
and possibly to reflect a functional status of the intracortical communication, was
significantly lower in alpha and beta frequency in AD patients [7].
Recent progress in the theory of the nonlinear dynamics has provided new methods
for the study of the time-series physiological data. The nonlinear analysis of the EEG
data could be a useful tool to differentiate normal and pathologic brain state. Several
studies of the EEG in AD patients estimated the correlation dimension (D2) and Lyapunov exponent (L1) [8-9]. They showed significantly lower values of D2 and L1 in
AD than age-matched normal subjects, reflecting less complex signal dynamics.
Another useful quantitative electrophysiological assessment for the monitoring of
the cortical function is the event-related potential (ERP). Since Goodin et al.(1978)
demonstrated the prolonged latency in the P3 component with aging [10], many researchers have studied the ERP components in AD patients but this is still a matter of
debate, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specialty of the ERP remain yet to be confirmed [11-12].
In this study, we propose an automatic AD recognition method combined the genetic algorithms (GA) and the artificial neural network (ANN), using the spontaneous
EEG and auditory ERP recorded from a single site. The EEG and ERP were analyzed
to compute their spectral features as well as statistical and nonlinear features, to make
a feature pool. The combined GA/ANN approach was applied to select the dominant
features that are most efficient to classify two groups. The selected features were used
as a neural network input for training and testing the network.

2 Method
We adopted the artificial neural network as a usual classifier to discriminate the AD
patients from the normal subjects, using the computed EEG and ERP features. Applying the ANN as an effective classifier, we have to find the optimum and minimum
features as a network input. To solve this problem we used the genetic algorithm to
find the dominant input features from a feature pool.
2.1 The Feature Pool
With the electrophysiological data of the AD patients and normal subjects, we made a
feature pool that represents their data. The spontaneous EEG data were divided into
30s segments and each segment was analyzed to compute their spectral, statistical and
nonlinear characteristics, to generate 118 features. The ERP data to target tone with
an averaging epoch 1s including 100ms of the prestimulus baseline, were analyzed to
generate 10 features that would describe the characteristic of the patterns.

The final feature pool includes as follow;
- 88 power spectral measurements: for example, the maximum power, the frequency
at the maximum power, the accumulated and relative power, the mean and variance of the power in d, q, a, b, g band separately
- 28 statistic measurements: for example, the average amplitude, the range between
the maximum and minimum amplitude, the ratio between the maximum and mean
amplitude, the variance
- 2 chaotic features: the central tendency, the box-counting dimension
- 10 ERP features: for example, the latency and amplitude of the largest peak, the
left second peak and right second peak in 300-700ms post-stimulus, the difference
of amplitude and latency
2.2 Design of the Chromosomes and the Fitness Function
In the genetic algorithms, the concepts of chromosome are used to encode and manipulate the solution [13]. Each chromosome defines an individual of a population.
We set a chromosome as a string consisted of 35 constants, that are representing the
feature number in the feature pool and that will be used as a network input.
With this input of a chromosome after learning the ANNs to every training segment, the fitness function gives back a value for the chromosome, which is measuring
the performance on the solution. The fitness value of a chromosome was defined as
the inverse of the sum of mean square errors of the ANNs, by equation 1 where N is
the number of ANNs, m is the number of output nodes of ANNi , doj is the desired
output of output node j and no is the network output of output node j.

2.3 The Genetic Operation
To create a population for a new generation, three basic genetic operations were used:
crossover, mutation, and reproduction. One or two chromosomes in a formal generation were selected by the roulette wheel method as the parent chromosomes, with a
probability based on its fitness value. In the crossover operation, two offspring chromosomes were produced from two parents by the one-point crossover. In the mutation, only one terminal of a parent chosen randomly would be mutated to generate a
new chromosome. The reproduction operation copied a parent chromosome to the
next generation.

2.4 The Combined GA/ANN Approach
1. Generate an initial population of the first generation with random proportions of
the terminals.
2. Repeat the following steps until the terminating criterion has been satisfied. The
evolution would be terminated, once a fitness value reach to 10,000.
- Evaluate each chromosome in the population. After training the ANN using the
features in the chromosome as a network input, it would be assigned a fitness
value for each chromosome.
- Create a population for the next generation by the genetic operations. These operations are applied to the chromosomes in a formal generation with the probabilities based on their fitness.
3. Choose a chromosome that has the maximum fitness value in each generation.
Using these chromosomes chosen from several generations, we selected a dominant feature set. We made a histogram showing the number of the selection by
these chromosomes for each feature, as shown in the figure 1, which would represent the significance of the feature to fit the solution. We selected the 35 dominant
features in order of their significances.
4. Train and test the ANN with these dominant features as a network input.

3 Experiments and Results
3.1 Data Acquisition

Subjects. Two groups of the early AD patients and the age-matched normal subjects
were studied. Sixteen AD patients were recruited from the oriental neuropsychiatric
and neurological sections of Kyunghee University Hospital, aged between 61-82 (72
 6.4, mean  SD). The patients with probable AD were diagnosed using the K-DRS
(Korean-dementia rating scale) criteria [14] and their MMSE scores ranged from 15
to 27 with an average score of 19.5. The K-DRS consists of five subcategories
including attention, initiation & preservation, construction, computation, and
memory. Other medical conditions that are known to produce dementia were
excluded following neurological and neuroimaging studies. None of the patients have
been previously diagnosed with the psychiatric disorders, such as a depression,
attention deficit, or schizophrenia, nor have they any history of significant head
trauma, intracranial mass lesion, or any other neurological condition that could be
associated with cognitive decline. Sixteen volunteers were the normal subjects aged
between 61-78 (70  5.3). They were carefully screened to eliminate individuals with
the medical and neuropsychiatric disorder.

EEG recording. The EEG was recorded from an Ag-AgCl electrode placed at P4
based on the 10-20 system, referenced to linked earlobes with recording the EOG.
The impedance of the electrodes was kept below 5 kW. The EEG was filtered
(bandpass 0.5-35 Hz), amplified, digitized (250Hz) and stored on a hard disk for the
off-line analysis. Spontaneous EEG with the eyes open was recorded for about 5min,
of which artifact-free segments were selected for the analysis. The EEG data was
divided into 30s segments, and in each segment 118 features were computed.

Auditory ERP procedure. Event-related potentials were acquired during the
auditory oddball task. The stimuli consisted of series of sine-wave tones of 1 kHz and
1.5 kHz, each lasting 300ms. The two tones occurred respectively in 75% and 25% of
the trials, in a random sequence. A total of 100 stimuli, including frequent 1 kHz tone
and infrequent 1.5 kHz tone were delivered with an inter-stimulus interval of 0.8-1.2s.
The subjects were instructed to count internally the number of the 1.5 kHz ‘target’
tones. The ERP data of the target tone that is averaged with an epoch of 1s including
100ms of the prestimulus baseline, were analyzed to generate 10 features to be
included in the feature pool.

3.2 Selection of Dominant Features and Performance of Neural Network
We used 137 EEG segments from 11 AD patients and 10 normal subjects as a training
data set. After training, the combined GA/ANN approach found the 35 dominant
features including 24 spectral, 8 statistical, 1 nonlinear and 2 ERP features. Figure 1
shows a histogram for selecting the dominant features. It indicates the number of the
selection by the 17 chromosomes that have the highest fitness value each in the last
17 generations. We selected the 35 dominant features in order of their heights, which
were marked by the rectangular boxes in the figure.
The selected dominant features were applied as a network input to train the ANN
again with 137 training EEG segments. After training, the weight values of the ANN
were determined to able to test the performance of the network. The 72 EEG segments for the test were from 5 AD patients and 6 normal subjects. Table 2 reports the
performance of the network for these untrained data set. For the EEG of the AD patients, the ANN recognized 22 segments out of the 30 test segments. And for the
normal EEG, 37 segments out of the 42 test segments were recognized correctly. The
5 segments the network fail to recognize were all from one normal subject.

4 Discussion
The main goal for the clinical research in the AD is enhancement of the diagnostic
accuracy and an earlier diagnosis. It is crucially important for the proper medical
treatment and slowing down of the illness progress. We propose a reliable method to
recognize the AD, only using one site of EEG recording. Single channel recordings of
EEG are extremely easy and convenient to perform, even on the AD patients. If this
simple tool has had enough accuracy to differentiate the AD patients from the normal
adults, it would be highly helpful to diagnose the disease and to reduce costs. With a
single channel EEG, our combined GA/ANN approach could find the dominant feature set and show good performance in determining the AD or normal EEG.
Our network was able to recognize successfully the EEG of normal subjects except
with one subject. Even though her DRS and MMSE scores are in the normal range,
the EEG of this subject could be deviant. In case of AD patients, 22 of the 30 segments were recognized correctly, so that the global recognition rate of the network
was 73%. Note that it was only the case using the features from the 30s segments of
the EEG data, and not with the every whole EEG data of each subject. With each
subject, the whole EEG data consisted of 4-8 segments. The network failed to recognize only one or two segments with each AD patient. The remaining segments, that
are more numerous, were recognized correctly as AD. Therefore, there should be no
flaw whether a subject has AD or not. The spontaneous EEG of AD patients may vary
a lot. In fact, the standard deviations in each segment (the 92nd statistic feature of the
feature pool) of the AD group were significantly higher than those of the normal
group (F(1,206)=8.162, p<.005). This feature was included in the dominant feature
set selected by the GA.
We selected the dominant features by the genetic algorithms and used them as an
optimum input of the neural network. We think this procedure enhanced the efficiency of the network. The redundant input from the raw EEG data or the manipulated data could make it rather worse. It was also useful to include the nonlinear characteristics and the ERP features in the feature pool, verified by the experimental results.

S. Cho et al.

It seems reasonable to conclude that a single channel EEG data might be enough to
recognize the AD using our combined GA/ANN approach. The suggested approach
could be extended to a reliable classification system using EEG recording that can
discriminate between groups.
