Introduction

With the rapid improvement in communication and computer technology, broadband
community network access to Internet and enterprise network has been the
consequent request, which can give home users voice service and more video
services. In the earlier of Internet, the data exchange is the main service provided by
business based on TCP/IP architecture. The Internet of 1990s has not only a great
improvement in scale and range, but also a extension to audio and video. During this
period, researchers have tried every method to improve the quality of service of
transferring audio and video streams in Internet, and also tried to provide the security
for data transfer and some reasonable accounting policies. Lately, people have got
great achievement in the transfer quality of audio and video in IP network. These
improvements expand the application range of IP Network, and now pure IP
telephone is quite popular, and TV service on IP is at the beginning. Except the
traditional data service and the replacement with telephone and TV service, the
broadband IP network[1] can provide some new-style applications, such as interactive
TV, video conference, E-commerce[4], e-learning and so on. “All is on in IP” is the
future of network development.

Issues in Broadband Access Network

2.1 Broadband Access Technologies
There are several typical technologies used for community broadband access network,
which are xDSL, Cabel Modem, FTTx+LAN and Wireless access.

Community Network with Integrated Services

DSL stands for “Digital Subscriber Line”, a broadband technology that uses
telephone lines and digital coding to create a connection to the internet from
computer. That link can carry vast amounts of voice, video and data information at
very high speeds. The Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line(ADSL) can provide
6~8Mbps data rates in the downstream direction while the upstream is relatively slow,
144~384Kbps. The Very-High-Bit-Rate Digital Subscriber Line(VDSL)[2] can reach
speeds up to 52Mbps downstream, and up to 13Mbps upstream, but it operates only
under distances not longer than 1.5 kilometers while ADSL can operate over 3.5
Kilometers. It is xDSL’s main advantage that it can utilize the user’s existed
telephone line, and its disadvantage is too expensive device. If using xDSL, the
telecommunication office must keep the same number of xDSL device with the users’.
So xDSL is only suitable for the residential area with low density.
Cable Modem is another broadband technology used for community access
network. Cable systems were originally designed to deliver broadcast television
signals efficiently to subscribers’ homes. To deliver data services over a cable
network, one television channel (in the 50-750MHz) is typically allocated for
downstream traffic to homes and another channel (5-42MHz) is used to carry
upstream signals. It have a very high-speed downstream bandwidth (frequency can
reach 1GHz), and is a very good access technology if only single-direction access.
But there are several big problems when it is been reconstructed to accept two-way
streams, they are the expensive reconstruction price, very limited upstream
bandwidth, and the amplified noise by upstream amplifiers.
FTTx+LAN is the extension of Internet, which is widely used in Enterprise
network and office network[5][6]. It carries several benefits for residential users: very
cheap access, easily to upgrade more advanced system, great extensibility. It will need
to solve more technology problems such as QoS, security and network accounting, if
FTTx+LAN are provided for internet access, IP telephone, LAN TV of residential
users. Its disadvantage is that this solution has very high technical threshold to be
crossed.
Wireless access is also an interesting broadband technology, especially in the
area which can’t be easily wired. Bluetooth and 802.11b are the main standard of
wireless access. They are not generally used because their short distance and slow
bandwidth.
2.2 QoS Provision
Our object is to implement an IP network which can carry many services. In this
network, the traditional burst-out traffic can share the same network device (router,
switch and links) with the traffic which request more strict delay, delay jitter,
bandwidth and lost-packet rate. So it can be named a QoS network, in which there are
many kinds of service, every of which have many traffic. The QoS means that in the
network it must be sure to provide the corresponding, expectable bandwidth for the
special class of service traffic without the knowledge of other traffics. IP packets
travel from source to one link, then across switch and router, at the last reach to
another link of destination. For QoS, these packets’ delay and jitter must be in a
restrict range defined by service. In broadband access network, main influence came
from the IP packet’s transfer policy of switch and the allocated bandwidth of links for
the service.

Z. Wu, J. Wang, and H. Zhang

We setup a rate shaping and a rate control policy which based on dual leaky
bucket algorithm[3] for the service provider, especially for the video service provider
which have very high-speed output, to prevent the overflow of data link’s bandwidth.
We also add the guarantee for quality of service by an access control algorithm in
network device for the classes of service by the current available bandwidth.
In switches, we add classify, queue and scheduler policy for traffics. The classify
policy is admitted to specify a class for a destination address, which class is allocate a
single transmit queue. A packet is dispatched to a specified class of queue by switch
after it is accepted. The packets in high priority of queue are sent prior to lower
priority of queue. Switch can provide classified services by classifying, queue and
scheduler function. For example, switch can transmit the data by the defined priority
of control packets, key service packets, voice packets, video packets and general
packets.
2.3 Security of Home Network
The home network’s security includes computer’s security and network’s security. In
this paper, we just only concentrate on the network security, which existed in
anywhere have network applications. The typical network security is the security of
business data by transfer in E-commerce. The content of network security ranges from
application layer to physics layer of OSI, and mainly is in network layer, data link
layer and physics layer when talked about in broadband access network.
The content of security in physics layer is to prevent wire tapping. Traditional
Ethernet have a basic idea of carrier detect, in which way signal is broadcast in a
shared line from which every one can listen others’ signal. This is not suitable to the
request of physics security. In our broadband access system, we use the switched
Ethernet as the basic transfer link, every user have and only have a separated line with
one of switch port, the signals of which can’t be listened by others.
To provide the security in data link layer, we must prevent the user’s own
information to be broadcast to other users. In general, VLAN can divide the whole
network to several broadcast area, so as to separate the data communication form each
other. But there are some problems in community network, in which many home of
community share a video stream of one video server and they should be in one and
the same VLAN with video server. And at the other times when they have a business
or shopping by network, they hope to be separated with others. So we implemented an
“asymmetric VLAN” technology to support the two requests.
PPPOE is a security technology of network layer on Ethernet. It basic idea is that
by PPPOE, IP packet is put into a PPP frame, which is encapsulated by Ethernet
frame. Every PPPOE user must login on PPPOE server, and establish a virtual PPPOE
channel with PPPOE server on Ethernet before transferring data. When PPPOE user
want to communicate with other user of a same LAN or outer network, PPPOE user
must send or receive data to PPPOE server firstly, and then PPPOE server will
transmit the data to their destination address or PPPOE user. Under PPPOE, everyone
can’t see others’ IP packet directly and they must get admits to network by
authentication, so user’s security and data’s security can be provided well.

2.4 Network Accounting
An accounting system should include both user authentication and billing. In a
community network, user authentication can be based on PPPOE, or other connection
properties like switch port number, MAC address of home gateway, or IP addresses;
And the following price schemes can be used: (1) Flat fee pricing, this is probably the
most simple and easy pricing scheme. That means subscribers pay each month certain
fixed amount of money, independent of what services they received or how much
traffic they used; (2) Usage-based pricing: The idea behind this scheme is that the
costs should reflect the amount of usage. The switches will record the information of
how much a user used the network, i.e. the amount of data a user has moved, or the
quantity of service he has enjoyed. That way anybody who thinks he needs a bigger
share of the resources of the network can have it by paying more. This pricing scheme
is superior to the flat fee scheme, for it can utilize the information of how a user use
the network; (3) Policy and content based pricing: This is a far more complicated
pricing scheme, it takes more considerations into the pricing decision, such as the
category of services, the traffic amount and time period of the services, even the
discount policy for those big customers can be included. This is a more decent and
integral scheme than the above twos.

Broadband Access System

3.1 Basic Ideas
Community broadband access network for integrated services is a very complicated
system, which involves many software and hardware technologies (Figure 1), such as
embedded real-time operating systems, multicast systems, QoS, network
management, communication protocols and routing algorithms.

3.1.1 Embedded Real-Time Operating Systems
Embedded Real-Time Linux is our choice of Embedded Real-Time operating system.
Its kernel has all public source code, which made it easily to develop in the special
hardware environment, and easily to improve the system’s performance. Another

50

Z. Wu, J. Wang, and H. Zhang

advantage is that its cost is very cheap than the business system with same
performance. Now, Embedded Real-Time Linux has been used in switches and home
gateway devices.
The software system of our Gbit access switch, named SW1000, is developed
based on the Linux system. We have tailored the Linux kernel, TCP/IP protocol stack
and some network application modules, such as ftp, telnet and so on, and add
install/uninstall module, self-protective module, flow accounting module, VLANsupport module, IGMP Snooping module, interrupt and debug module to make up of
a new kernel. In user’s space, we add the system configure interface, VLAN
management interface, network management interface and accounting proxy module.

3.1.2 Multicast Systems
The multicast source streams come from digital TV server, video server and other
video provider of WAN, which are selected to decode and playback in home gateway
by residential users. The multicast systems involve the server, switch and home
gateway device. Server can control multicast streams’ output rate by rate shaping and
rate control algorithm, at the same time the receivers decrease the influence of delay
jitter on the playback quality by pre-buffering video data. The IGMP modules in
home gateway cooperate with IGMP Snooping modules in switch to implement the
dynamic join and exit of a multicast group. This dynamic group management is the
base of dynamic selection of channel. A demand of one channel is in fact that a user
joins the multicast group corresponding to this channel, the exit of one channel is
correspond to the exit of the multicast group, the switch from one channel to another
channel is made up of the two operations.
3.1.3 QoS Provisioning Systems
The QoS system exists in the server, switch and home gateway. It is implemented
based on the RSVP, by which switch reserve the bandwidth that server or home
gateway requests. The switch has an access control policy, by which switch will deny
the new streams if there are no enough bandwidth to satisfy their requests, so to avoid
the network’s congestion. Server and home gateway transfer and receive data streams
only if their bandwidth request is satisfied. Switch also can classify, queue and
scheduler the packets by the defined priority.

3.1.4 Network Management Systems
Network management system of a broadband community network consists of error
management, configuration management, performance management, security
management and account management. It bears the same design principle as the
network management system in telephone networks, while they have very different
focuses. The telephone network focuses on the management of network elements,
while a community network puts more emphasis on the category of services and QoS
management.
3.2 Implementation
The idea of our IP-based broadband community network is offering convergent
services of Internet, IP phone and Digital TV through combined network of fiber and
LAN. The system is composed of Digital TV receivers, video servers, TV conference
servers, accounting servers, network management servers, broadband switches, home
gateways, PCs, analog or digital TV sets, and IP phone(Fig. 3).

Digital TV server’s main function is to receive the signals from satellites, demodulate
the DVB streams from them, demux the specified streams and put them into the IP
packets, lastly send them to users by network or store them in the video database. This
digital TV server consists of a high-performance computer, a receiving card for
satellite TV, network card and the software system.
Video server’s main function is to store, edit and send audio or video program. It
mainly consists of a high-performance computer, a network card and a video
database, which usually is a large scale disk-array.

3.2.1 Switches
The Gigabit switch SW1000 and the 100M switch SW100 are the main network
access devices for community network. SW1000 supports 8~48 ports of 10/100Mbps
or 1~6 Gigabit ports, each of them has the line-speed data switch capability. SW1000
consists of four modules: switch fabric modules, fast Ethernet modules, Gigabit
Ethernet modules, supervisor modules. SW100 support 16~32 ports of 10/100Mbps,
each of which has the line-speed data switch capability. SW100 consists of three
modules: switch fabric modules, fast Ethernet modules, supervisor modules.

3.2.2 Home Gateway
Home gateway is the network access device for home network, and it is also a
playback device for digital TV and other video programs. Its main function include:
provide the playback of digital TV with SDTV quality, and provide IP telephone
service, and provide internet data access such as www, email or other, and provide
video-on-demand service, and provide the management automation for community.
This device can decode and playback the DVB streams, and support the video output
of RGB, S-Video, composite Video, and support the video output by PAL/NTSC, and
support stereo audio output.
The home gateway device’s interfaces consist of two ports of 10BaseT Ethernet,
one S-Video port, one RGB port, one composite video port, and a pair of stereo audio
ports. One of the Ethernet ports is connected to the ports of switch, and the other one
is connected to PC or other network device of home user.
3.3 Future Development
3.3.1 Wireless Access
The coming down price of wireless devices and the rapid development of wireless
technologies make the wireless home network design a reality. Now we are making
enhancements to our home gateway devices, adding wireless modules to the device,
so that the gateway can function as an access points for household wireless devices.
(Figure 4).

3.3.2

Transition to IPv6

The community broadband network is the extension of Internet, which connects every
home into a whole network. But the scale of this network is limited because the
limited number of IP address. Today’s IP address is based on IPv4, of which available
address will exhaust in the very short future. The NAT technology can only slow
down this process and can’t radically solve the lacking-address problem because more
and more applications are based on the bidirectional UDP communication. Another
problem is the QoS and security which can’t be taken great improvement by IPv4.
IPv6 is designed to address these problems[7], so it becomes another focus of our

Community Network with Integrated Services

53

future research. The content of IPv6 project consists of how to transfer from IPv4 to
IPv6 smoothly and the new feature of broadband access and integrated service under
IPv6.
