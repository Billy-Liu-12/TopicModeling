Abstract. We report on the performance of the explicitly correlated second
order perturbation theory with frozen Gaussian-type geminals. Components in
the Hylleraas energy functional are analyzed using the ansatz based on the sand p-wave cusp conditions for singlet and triplet pairs. It is shown that
calculated correlation energies are improved substantially by the introduction of
the frozen geminals.

1 Introduction
In calculations with correlated methods, the basis set convergence is crucial for the
predictions of reliable energetics and properties. It has been shown that enormous
basis functions are required to achieve the chemical accuracy. This is the direct
consequence of the inability of describing the Coulomb cusp[1] with one-electronic
basis. To ameliorate this feature, various alternatives incorporating explicitly
correlated functions have been proposed. The Gaussian-type geminals (GTGs)[2,3,4]
have been used in many places. Especially, Szalewicz and coworkers introduced a
novel alternative in the Hylleraas functional with the requirement of at most 3electron integrals[5]. Although Gaussian-type functions never become exact for the
cusp condition, the methods have shown the efficiency predicting correlation energy
to an accuracy of 1µEh, as demonstrated by Cencek and Rychlewski[6] This situation
is comprehensible by evaluating the motion of pair-electrons in the three-dimension
space, i.e. the gain from the cusp around a fixed electron scales as 4π r122 , vanishing at

r12 = 0 .
The R12 methods [7,8,9,10] developed by Kutzelnigg and coworkers utilize the
linear r12 behavior with systematic approximations using the resolution of identity
(RI) for bypassing the explicit treatment of 3- and 4-electron integrals. A large basis
set is, however, required to guarantee the accuracy of RI with the non-vanishing
ansatz. The long-range nature of the linear r12 behavior also makes a scalable
treatment less straightforward. As a compromise between GTG and R12, Persson and
Taylor proposed a method which fits the linear r12 behavior with GTG to avoid the
nonlinear optimization[11]. The method aims at calculations of modest accuracy in
comparison with the previous GTG theories, i.e. sub-mEh accuracy for valence

correlations within the framework of the second order many-body perturbation theory
(MBPT2).
All of the above methods use explicitly correlated functions with orthogonal
projectors and the Hylleraas energy functional. The transcorrelated method [12,13] of
Boys and Handy is on the basis of a correlation factor independent of pairs. The
similarity transformed Hamiltonian includes at most three-body effective interactions.
Recently, we developed a new transcorrelated method with frozen GTG especially for
pair-wise short-range collisions [14,15]. The method does not require any
optimization of the correlation factor making use of the cusp condition. Instead, the
long-range correlations are dealt with in terms of the usual configuration interaction
(CI)-type expansion. In this paper, we study the second order Hylleraas energy
functional of frozen GTG. When the geminals are universal for correlated pairs, the
component of the kinetic energy operator is closely related to the transcorrelated
Hamiltonian through the virial theorem. The effect of the p-wave cusp condition is
also examined for triplet pairs. Numerical results are given in Sec. 3. and the
conclusion is depicted in Sec. 4.

2 MBPT2 with Frozen GTG
Henceforward, we denote orthonormalized occupied and general orbitals in a given
basis set as ijK and pqK respectively. In the GTG method, the second order energy
is expressed as a sum of the usual MBPT2 energy and a correction in the Hylleraas
energy functional outside the Hilbert space spanned by the given basis set,

EV(2) = E (2) + ∆EV(2) = E (2) − ∆EN(2) + 2∆EZ( 2) ,

(1)

∆EN( 2) = ∑∑ (cij( S , M ) ) 2 {ij}( S , M ) K12( L ) (Q1*Q2* − Q1Q2 ) f12 {ij}( S , M ) ,

(2)

∆EZ( 2) = ∑∑ cij( S , M ) {ij}( S , M ) r12−1 (Q1*Q2* − Q1Q2 ) f12 {ij}( S , M ) ,

(3)

SM i ≥ j

SM i ≥ j

where Qn* and Qn are one-electron projectors in the virtual spaces for the complete
and given basis sets, respectively, {ij}( S , M ) denotes the spin-adapted antisymmetrized
pair functions, cij( S , M ) are variational parameters, and the operator, K12( L ) , is an antihermite single commutator between the explicitly correlated geminal, f12 , and the
kinetic energy operator,

K12( L ) = [T1 + T2 , f12 ] = −(∇12 f12 ) − (∇1 f12 ) ⋅ (∇1 − ∇ 2 ) ,

(4)

f12 is expanded as a linear combination of spherically symmetric GTGs. The
quantum numbers of the pair functions take the values, ( S , M ) = (0, 0),

(1, 0),

(1, ±1) for i ≠ j and ( S , M ) = (0, 0) for i = j . The commutator involving the
exchange operator is neglected in this particular work as in the MP2-R12/A ap-

proximation[9]. All three energy corrections become identical, ∆EV(2) = ∆EN(2) = ∆EZ(2) ,
when the geminal is exact outside the orbital space,

(Q1*Q2* − Q1Q2 )(cij( S , M ) K12( L ) + r12−1 ) {ij}( S , M ) = 0, ∀ijSM .

(5)

Thus the ratio,

χ = ∆EZ(2) / ∆EN(2) ,

(6)

which becomes unity in the above condition, is a good measure to indicate the
appropriateness of geminals. It is possible to think of the connection between ∆EV(2)
and ∆EN(2) as the virial theorem for the cusp condition. When cij( S , M ) are coincident for
all pairs, ∆EN(2) is directly obtained from the order-by-order expansion of the
Schrödinger equation for the transcorrelated Hamiltonian [14]. In the transcorrelated
method, the first order cusp condition in f12 is renormalized to infinite order in the
similarity transformed Hamiltonian.
According to the analytical resolution,

Q1*Q2* = 1 − P1 − P2 + P1 P2 ,

(7)

∆EN( 2) = ∆EN(2) [1] − ∆EN(2) [ P1 + P2 ] + ∆EN(2) [ P1 P2 ] − ∆EN(2) [Q1Q2 ] ,

(8)

∆EN( 2) [O] = ∑∑ (cij( S , M ) ) 2 {ij}( S , M ) K12( L ) Of12 {ij}( S , M ) ,

(9)

the functional is divided as

SM i ≥ j

and a similar expression for ∆EZ(2) . The component, ∆EN(2) [1] , can be rewritten in the
commutator form leading to the operator, K12( Q ) , which appears in the transcorrelated
method,

∆EN( 2) [1] = ∑∑ (cij( S , M ) ) 2 {ij}( S , M ) K12( Q ) {ij}( S , M ) ,

K12( Q ) = [ K12( L ) , f12 ] = −(∇1 f12 ) ⋅ (∇1 f12 ) .

The term with single projectors reduces to 3-electron integrals and is approximated
using RI of Kutzelnigg and Klopper[8], in the spin orbital basis as,

ij K12( L ) P1 f12 kl ≅ ∑ ij K12( L ) mp mp f12 kl ,

(12)

mp

Since the 2-electron integrals in the RI expressions involve three occupied orbitals,
the maximum angular momentum required in the RI basis becomes 3Locc for the
highest occupied angular momentum, Locc , in an atomic calculation. Thus s-, f-, and ifunctions contribute for systems with s-, p-, and d-occupied shells, respectively. Very

recently, making use of density fitting, we developed a novel decomposition scheme,
which reduces the requirement to 2 Locc [16]. We do not employ the scheme in this
work, focusing on molecules without d-occupied orbitals. The performance of the
approximation is investigated using the index of RI,

τ = ∆EN(2) [ P1 + P2 ] − 2∆EZ(2) [ P1 + P2 ] + 4∆EZ(2) [ P1 P2 ]

(13)

The term, ∆EZ( 2) [ P1 P2 ] , dependent on the description of occupied orbitals has
relatively large amplitude whereas ∆EN( 2) [ P1 P2 ] is zero because of the symmetry of the
operator, K ( L ) . The exact energy for a given basis and f12 ,

EV(2) = EV(2) − τ + τ

(14)

is estimated with a reliable τ of an augmented basis set.
We bypass the optimizations of the parameters, cij( S , M ) , the coefficients and
exponents of GTGs, using a template geminal, f12t , expanded as a linear combination
of 10 Gaussians. It is determined in such a way that the Coulomb repulsion multiplied
by a short-range weight Gaussian is suppressed in the similarity transformed
Hamiltonian [14]. For the exponents, we use an even-tempered sequence in the range
between 106 and 0.5 along with the weight Gaussian with the exponents, 5. f12t is
further transformed with a scaling parameter, cZ , as

f (r12 ; cZ ) = cZ−1 f t (cZ r12 ) .

3 Results and Discussions
Table 1 shows the results of the Ne atom with the uncontracted functions in the
correlation consistent basis sets [20,21]. We took the reference value of the RI index,
τ , from the calculations with aug-cc-pCVQZ (uncontracted) set, which is sufficiently
accurate to ca. 0.2mEh [16]. The errors in RI, τ − τ , are significant especially for the

Explicitly Correlated Second Order Perturbation Theory

use of a small basis set and a large cz . The positive increment of EV(2) with cz = 1
from VDZ to VTZ is mostly an artifact of the insufficiency of the DZV set, in which
the f-shells are absent. The energy, –399.84 mEh, in the calculation of (16s10p6d) and
cz = 1 is also lower than the MBPT2 limit by ca. 12 mEh artificially. It is preferable
to use the decomposition scheme with density fitting to bypass the requirement of the
f-shells[16]. The slightly positive increment from (16s10p6d4f) to (16s10p6d4f2g) is
due to the neglect of the commutator between the exchange and geminal operators
since the augmentation of the g-shell does not affect the accuracy of RI.
The electron correlation is a short-range phenomenon. Thus the calculation with
VXZ sets shows that the results become less sensitive to the choice of cz with the
increase of the cardinal number, X. The series of ACVQZ shows quite different
behavior; the estimated energy, EV(2) , is almost saturated at the d-shell and is less
sensitive to the augmentation of angular functions at cz = 1 . In the difference between
VTZ and CVTZ, the results with cz = 2 and 3 are hardly altered whereas there is an
improvement, ca. 5mEh for cz = 1 . This implies that the geminal with a large radius
is inappropriate for correlations concerning core electrons and the situation is
improved significantly by the augmentation of the core correlation functions.

We show the calculated MBPT2 energies of some molecules with cc-pVTZ basis
set (uncontracted) and cz = 2 in Table 2. The conventional MBPT2 covers from 83%
(Ne) to 89% (CH4) of the correlation energies in the complete basis limits. In
explicitly correlated calculations, the ratio, χ , is dependent on the choice of cz and
basis set as seen in the Ne result. It however ranges in a small area between 0.98 (Ne)
and 1.06 (H2O) irrespective of the system. Generally speaking, the error of RI reduces
in the calculation of a molecule compared to atoms. The effects are thus estimated
less than 1% (for Ne) in the correlation energy. The use of the frozen GTG reproduces
ca. 96% of the MBPT2 energies reducing the correlation error by 2/3–3/4 compared
to the conventional expansion.

4 Conclusion
We have illustrated the MBPT2 method with frozen GTG. Instead of minimizing the
pair energy functional, the s- and p-wave cusp conditions are utilized in adapting the
geminal. It is shown that the present method improves the calculation of MBPT2
energy substantially.
