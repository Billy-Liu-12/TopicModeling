Abstract. There have been many technological dawns in the last 30
years, during which the desktop computer and the Internet have been
developed. The importance of Internet in education, particularly using its
Web is a well-recognized fact. A wealth of resources and techniques now
exist which serve as a source both for exciting examples of new teaching
practices, as well as easily accessible methods for adoption into various
formats of teaching and learning. Internet technology allow teachers and
students keep up with their minds. It let them try their ideas as soon
as they come up with them. Generally, students appreciate the convenience, choice, and ﬂexibility that an online courses oﬀers. Instructional
designers value the standardized framework and ﬂexibility. WebMathematica is a web-based technology developed by Wolfram Research that
allows the generation of dynamic web content with Mathematica. With
this technology, the distance education students should be able to explore and experiment with the mathematical concepts. In this paper we
will elucidate the pedagogical issues in the application of Hamiltonian
systems in the webMathematica for the distance learning environment
and the shape of the future “classroom” as well as relevant educational
strategies towards improving mathematics education.

Introduction

The demand for ‘anytime-anywhere’ education is now a common feature in the
current educational background and thus further enhances the application of Distance Education technologies in the shift towards networked learning in the creation of a knowledge-based society. Distance education is planned learning that
normally occurs in a diﬀerent place from teaching and as a result requires special
techniques of course design, special instructional techniques, special methods of
communication by electronic and other technology, as well as special organizational and administrative arrangements [1]. Internet-based distance learning
is now ﬁnding its way into high school. The growth of Internet-based distance
learning will have a signiﬁcant impact upon traditional education. The growth
of Internet-based distance learning will inﬂuence traditional education as the
availability of sophisticated software that everyone can use, in school and out.
As suggested by Dunn [2], this occurrence will blur the distinctions between
distance learning and traditional education. One signiﬁcant change in distance

education is the increasing emphasis on the student learning, rather than the institution teaching. The majority of students at any distance learning institutions
are adults and between the age of 28–35 years old. The idea of constructivism
applies equally well to them as well as normal traditional face to face students.
The ability of students to construct their own knowledge can arouse their interest in mathematics. Mathematics students need to acquire higher order skills
to be able to think mathematically and be able to apply what they learn to
new situations. With the advancement of ICT, innovative use of technology at
early tertiary level can motivate and enliven the students in the learning of
mathematics especially in distance learning environment. One of the most exciting new technologies for dynamic mathematics on the World Wide Web is a
webMathematica. This new technology developed by Wolfram research enables
instructors to create web sites that allows users to compute and visualize results
directly from a web browser. This is achieved by integrating the Mathematica
computer algebra system with the latest web server technology. The students
use the existing Internet browsers such as Internet Explorer or Netscape as an
interface to webMathematica and they do not need to know Mathematica to
use it. Through webMathematica the instructors and students can fully utilized
the computational power of Mathematica for pedagogical applications. In view
of the emergence of this new technology, there are some important issues that
relate to the instructional design of on-line material with webMathematica for
eﬀective learning. Need to structure and communicate the knowledge in ways
that enable a diversity of learners to understand and apply the knowledge that
has been learned.

Why webMathematica?

Essential to all types of learning is the pedagogy, which is the art and science of
teaching. Designing and developing on line learning material with webMathematica presents special challenges. The instructional design process is particularly
more important in distance education as instructor and students share limited
common background and typically have very minimal face-to-face-contact. The
issues concern with the goals/objectives, content, design approach, methods and
strategies of using webMathematica in distance learning mathematics as well as
in the traditional face-to-face teaching.
Visualization has a major impact on the understanding of mathematical
concepts. With webMathematica to do online computation and interactive on
line visualization of Mathematica graphics in web pages, it can make learning
mathematics among adult learners more fun to learn. Besides textual descriptions, images can be used as a communication medium to convey mathematical
ideas/results in a comprehensive way to the students. Examples of this aspect
is using webMathematica to graph the ODE that model dynamical system and
requiring the students to make interpretation based on the graph.
The students are expected to be able to make conclusion and deduction of the
stability and of the long term behavior of solutions. It is important for students

776

to gain an understanding of fundamental ideas in mathematics like continuity
and limits and use webMathematica to reinforce their understandings.
Traditional students can digest the material before their regular lecture and
Mathematica lab. Instructors need knowledge to program with Mathematica
Server Pages (MSP) technology and some knowledge in instructional design.
Another important issue is to determine the types of instructional activities
needed with webMathematica for the learning processes and learning outcomes
to foster critical thinking. How webMathematica can be used to teach high order
thinking skills such as puzzles, reasoning and problems solving. With webMathematica, we can do virtually all the mathematics like diﬀerentiation, integration,
plotting graph etc. But the important questions do the students understand the
process and the underlying concepts.
Use the strategies and various e-learning methods that include presentation,
demonstration, drill and practice, tutorials, simulations, discussion, interaction,
modeling, facilitation, collaboration, motivation.
– Design tasks that are more engaging, as well as allow us to assess skills that
cannot be measured in paper and pencil
– Develop and delivering test with webMathematica?

An Application

Example of interactive learning material developed with webMathematica for
Diﬀerential Equations. The instructors design the webpage that discuss particular idea or concept and Gagne’s learning theories serve as the basis for designing
the instruction. The typical material is organized in modular form with the
instructional objective clearly spelled out at the beginning of the lesson. The
topics of discussion is the concept of Hamiltonian Systems. Adult students as
well as traditional students face diﬃculty understanding the concept of diﬀerential equations. With webMathematica, a visual representation might be useful in
the form of animation and interactive. The answer to what is the Hamiltonian
function is not the main instructional goal. In the following section we consider
the Hamiltonian systems and the basics of MSP scripts. It will require some
knowledge of HTML, including FORM and INPUT elements.
3.1

Hamiltonian Systems

A system
x˙ = X(x, y), y˙ = Y (x, y)

(1)

is called a Hamiltonian system if there exists a function H(x, y) such that
X(x, y) =

∂H(x, y)
∂H(x, y)
, Y (x, y) = −
∂y
∂x

(2)

Then H is called the Hamiltonian function for the system. A necessary and
suﬃcient condition for (1) to be Hamiltonian is that
∂X
∂Y
+
= 0.
∂x
∂y

(3)

Let x(t), y(t) represent a particular time solution. Then along the corresponding phase path,
∂H dx ∂H dy
dH
=
+
= 0.
dt
∂x dt
∂y dt

(4)

Therefore H(x, y) = c along any phase path. Since H(x, y) is constant , the
phase paths are the level curves, or contours, of the H(x, y) = c of the surface
z = H(x, y) in three dimensions. Suppose that the system has an equilibrium
point at (xo , yo ). Suppose conditions for the three main types of stationary point
are given by standard theory: we condense the standard criteria as follows. Put
qo =

∂2H ∂2H
∂2H 2
)
−
(
∂x2 ∂y 2
∂x∂y

evaluated at (xo , yo ) . Then
– H(x, y) has a maximum or minimum at (xo , yo ) if qo > 0
– H(x, y) has a saddle at (xo , yo ) if qo < 0

(5)

Since the phase paths are the contours of z = H(x, y), we expect that in the
case qo > 0, the equilibrium point at (xo , yo ) will be a centre, and that in the
ﬁrst case it will be a saddle point. There is no case corresponding to a node or
spiral: a Hamiltonian system contains only and various types of saddle point.
The same prediction is obtained by linearzing the equations at the equilibrium
point.[5]

that, when pressed, will submit the FORM. When the FORM is submitted, it will
send information from INPUT elements to the URL speciﬁed by the ACTION
attribute; in this case, the URL is the same MSP. Information entered by the
user is sent to a Mathematica session and assigned to a Mathematica symbol (see
Figure 2). Additionally, the Mathlets refer to Mathematica functions that are
not in standard usage. In this example some Mathematica commands; Integrate,
Solve, If, PlotVectorField, Switch and some mathematical operations are used
by the Mathlets. The name of the symbol is given by prepending $$ to the value
of the NAME attribute. MSPValue returns the value of variable or a default if
no value. This example also demonstrates the use of page scoped variables with
MSPToExpression. MSPToExpression interprets values and returns the result.
MSPShow saves an image on the server and returns the necessary HTML to
refer to this image. The image uses a GIF format; it is possible to save images
in other formats. [2]

Concluding Remarks

– It is well known that students learn more quickly, and with less pain, when
concepts can be demonstrated interactively.This can be achieved with webMathematica which is based on MSP. To create dynamic mathematics material online with webMathematica, the instructors require some knowledge
of HTML and Mathematica programming.
– Distance Education and educational technologies will deﬁnitely change the
way we teach in the future. To date, distance learning has largely been directed at providing educational materials to those who cannot attend faceto-face classes. In the future, we see the technologies employed in distance
learning used for all kinds of learners, not just distance learners. This does
not certainly means that the value of face-to-face student-instructor interaction is diminishing. Instead, interactive online materials free the instructors
to spend more time with students. The power of interactive content enhances,
rather than replaces, face-to-face teaching.
– There is a limitation of the webMathematica as a teaching tool and if not
properly plan it can potentially be a major cause of wasted time. Problems
that require visual representation like graph,diagrams,animations and moving images is great with webMathematica that respond to students questions,
answers or commands.
