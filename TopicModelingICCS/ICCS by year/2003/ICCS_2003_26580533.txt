Abstract. Analog of Grobman-Hartman theorem about stable and unstable manifolds solutions for diﬀerential equations in Banach spaces
with degenerate Fredholm operator at the derivative are proved. In contrast to usual evolution equation here central manifold arises even in
the case of spectrum absence on the imaginary axis. Jordan chains tools
and implicit operator theorem are used. The obtained results allow to
develop center manifold methods for computation of bifurcation solution
asymptotics and their stability investigation.

Introduction

Branching theory of solutions of nonlinear equations has various applications in
scientiﬁc computing [1], [2], [3]. This is one of the areas in applied mathematics
intensively developing in last ﬁfty years. The goals of this theory are the qualitative theory of dynamical systems [3], computation of their solutions [4] under
absence of conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of the solutions. The classical
Lyapounov-Schmidt method even in contemporary presentation [5] often insuﬃcient for computation of complicated dynamics, like bifurcation to invariant tori.
Therefore in the last two decades the center manifold theory [6] and methods
are developed. However this theory is completely absent for evolution equations
with degenerate operator at the derivative, having numerous applications in ﬁltration theory [7], nonlinear waves theory (the Boussinesq-Love equation) [8]
and motion theory of non-Newtonian ﬂuids [9].
The presented work is devoted to invariant manifolds technique and presents
the introduction to center manifold methods for evolution equations with Fredholm operator at the derivative. It has found some applications to investigation
of the bifurcating solutions stability [10]. The second section of this article contains the necessary tools of generalized Jordan chains, the third, fourth and
ﬁfth ones – some aspects of invariant manifolds theory and Grobman-Hartman

theorem analogs for such equations. Here the nontrivial center manifold arises
even at the absence of σA (B) spectrum on the imaginary axis. It is considered
also the simple case of σA (B) presence on imaginary axis (section 4). For the
computation of center manifold in section 3 successive approximation method is
suggested.

Generalized Jordan Chains Tools

Let E1 and E2 be Banach spaces, A : E1 ⊃ DA → E2 , B : E1 ⊃ DB → E2
be densely deﬁned closed linear Fredholm operators, where DB ⊂ DA and A
is subordinated to B (i.e. Ax ≤ Bx + x on DB ) or DA ⊂ DB and B is
subordinated to A (i.e. Bx ≤ Ax + x on DA ). The diﬀerential equation

property of the operator B [13]) with some special contour γ belonging to sector

The more so, this is true when the operator A B is bounded.
At the generalization of the Grobman-Hartman theorem we will follow to the
work [11]. Let us deﬁne the spaces Dk , k = 1, 2 with graphs norms:
10 . D1 = DB ⊂ DA with the norm x 1 = x E1 + Bx E2 , x ∈ D1 , if A is
subordinated to B,
20 . D2 = DA ⊂ DB with the norm x 2 = x E1 + Ax E2 , x ∈ D2 , if B is
subordinated to A,
and introduce the spaces Xk0 , Xk1 , Xk2 , Yk0 , Yk1 , Yk2 consisting of the bounded
uniformly continuous functions f (t) on [0, ∞) with their values correspondingly
in Dk , Dk ∩ E1∞−kA , E1kA , E2 , E2,∞−kA , E2,kA with supremum norms on the
relevant spaces, and the spaces

Everywhere below the operator A B is supposed to be bounded in Xk1 (for
the case k=1 it is evident). Then the operator
Ax = Ax˙ − Bx

(11)

acting from Xk0
to Yk0 is linear and continuous with Xk2 ⊂ N (A).
Let be Dk ⊃ Sk = {initial values of solutions of the equation (8), which
are deﬁned and remain in a small neighborhood of zero in Dk for t ∈ [0, +∞)}

and Uk = {initial values of solutions of (8), which are deﬁned and remain in a
small neighborhood of zero in Dk for t ∈ (−∞, 0]}. From (11) it follows that

Now setting x = y + z + v, z ∈ Dk+ , v ∈ Dk0 = E1kA , y ∈ Dk− one can write
the equation (1) in the form (w = y + z in (9))
Az = R(z + y + v)

(Ay = R(y + z + v))

(12)

and apply the implicit operator theorem to (12) regarding y, v (z, v) as functional
parameters (see the relevant theorems 22.1 and 22.2 in [5] for continuous and
analytic operator R respectively). It follows that (12) has a suﬃciently smooth
or analytic (according to the properties of the operator R) solution in some
neighborhoods of parameters y, v (z, v) zero values
z = z(y + v),

z(0) = 0 = Dz(0)

(y = y(z + v), y(0) = 0 = Dy(0))

(13)

Consequently it is true the following Grobman-Hartman theorem [11] analogue
asserting that the local solutions behavior for nonlinear equation in hyperbolic
equilibrium neighborhood is the same that for its linearization.

and tends to zero when t → +∞(t → −∞), and belongs, consequently, to local
stable manifold Sk (R) (local unstable manifold Uk (R)).

there is a unique solution of (12) z = zR (ξ(t) · φ + y(t)) ∈ Xk1

x(0) = ξ · φ + η + zR (ξ · φ + η), i.e. the unique solution of (1) x(t) = v(t) + y(t) +
zR (ξ(t) · φ + y(t)), v(t) = ξ(t) · φ, in a suﬃciently small semi-neighborhood of
t = 0, where the function zR (ξ, η) = zR (ξ · φ + η) is suﬃciently smooth by ξ, η,

Writing the equation (1) in p, q-projections at the usage of the theorem 1
one can get the system for the determination of ξis (t) (so-named the resolving
system (RS) for the equation (1) [12,10,14]). Here x(t) = ξ(t) · φ + w(t), where
w(t) = y(t) + zR (ξ(t) · φ + y(t)) for t ≥ 0 and w(t) = yR (ξ(t) · φ + z(t)) + z(t)

Consequently, the manifold Sk (R) = { initial values of solutions of the equation
(1), which are deﬁned and remain in a small neighborhood of 0 ∈ Dk for t ∈
[0, +∞)} (the manifold Uk (R) = { initial values of solutions (1), which are
deﬁned and remain in a small neighborhood of 0 ∈ Dk for t ∈ (−∞, 0]}) has the
form x(0) = ξ · φ + η + zR (ξ · φ + η) (x(0) = ξ · φ + yR (ξ · φ + ζ) + ζ), where
η ∈ Dk− (ζ ∈ Dk+ ) and ξ are small.
Remark 1. Determined by the function ξ·φ+η+zR (ξ·φ+η) for t ≥ 0 (ξ·φ+yR (ξ·
φ + ζ) + ζ for t ≤ 0) invariant manifold M can be regarded as center manifold
(ξ · φ ∈ Dk0 ), that is nontrivial for the equation (1) even if {µ ∈ σA (B)|Re µ =
0} = ø. Here {ξ · φ} can be named as linear center manifold tangent to M. One
can say that M has an hyperbolic structure. Thus the RS (15) represents the
diﬀerential-algebraic system on M. Of course, if the operator A is invertible, M
and the system (15) are absent, i.e. in the Grobman-Hartman theorem zR =
zR (η) [11].
Theorem 2. Let the operators A, B and R in (1) be intertwined by the group
G representations Lg (acting in E1 ) and Kg (acting in E2 ) and the condition I
(direct supplements E1∞−m to N (A) and E1∞−n to N (B) are invariant relative to
Lg ) is satisﬁed. Then the center manifold M is invariant relative to the operators
Lg .

Invariant Manifolds and Grobman-Hartman Theorem

539

Proof. According to [14] projectors p, P(q, Q) commute with the operators
Lg (Kg ) and invariant pairs of subspaces reduce the representations Lg (Kg ).
In the article [10] it is proved that the stability (instability) of the trivial solution (even for non-autonomous) equation (1) at suﬃciently general conditions
is determined by the RS (15) with corollaries for the investigation of the stability
(instability) of bifurcating solutions.
+
˙ k0 , x(t) =
(B) = ø. Then Dk = Dk− +D
It is interesting the case when σA
ξ(t) · φ + y(t) and the center manifold has the form ξ(t) · φ + y(ξ(t) · φ). Here the
equation (14) gives
dξ
A y (ξ(t) · φ)( dt · φ) =B y(ξ(t) · φ) + (I − q)R(ξ(t) · φ + y(ξ(t) · φ)),
y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0

(16)

In combination with (15) this gives a possibility for the determination of center
manifold w(ξ(t) · φ) = ξ(t) · φ + y(ξ(t) · φ) by successive approximations in
conditions of suﬃciently smooth operator y(ξ · φ). However on this way essential
diﬃculties arise connected with the fact that the system (15) is diﬀerentialalgebraic, i.e. the diﬀerential equations for the functions ξi1 (t), i = 1, . . . , m, are
absent. One can ﬁnd y(ξ ·φ) iteratively at the diﬀerentiation of the ﬁrst equations
(15).
Remark 2. Theorem 1 and all corollaries remain true for the parameter depending equation

dt

R(0, λ) ≡ 0,

Rx (0, 0) = 0,

(17)

(λ ∈ Λ, Λ is some Banach space) in a small neighborhood of λ = 0, when as
earlier Re σA (B) = 0, i.e. λ = 0 is not a bifurcation point. However all functions
w, zR and yR will depend on small parameter ε.

ξ2iσ (0) = ξ2iσ , σ = 1, . . . , q2,i , i = 1, . . . , m2 .

If the system (18) is equipped with initial values x(0), y(0), then they must
satisfy the equality
y(0) = ξ2 · φ(2) + yR (ξ2 · φ(2) , x(0)).

(22)

Now one has to solve the problem
A1 x˙ = B1 x − f (x, ξ2 (t) · φ(2) + yR (ξ2 (t) · φ(2) , x))

(23)

at the initial data x(0) satisfying (22).
Thus one has two systems (21) and (23) on the center manifold
y = yR (ξ2 (t) · φ(2) , x).

linear). Thus the following assertion is true:
