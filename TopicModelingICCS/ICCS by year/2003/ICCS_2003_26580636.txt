Abstract. The project was focused on the thermal aspects of the new IPM
module design. The investigations were aimed to estimate the influence of the
particular design of the MOSFET transistor location versus the steady-state
thermal feature of the considered IPM and to determinate its thermal impedance
as well as to evaluate its equivalent RC network (ladder) model. It required
working out the 3-D thermal model of the considered system that was used in
numerical simulations and next, tested with commercial software, ANSYS 5.7
based on Finite Element Method (FEM).

1 Introduction
In any electronics equipment, the temperature rise above the permissible level
results in its worse work or even in its destruction. Therefore, the proper thermal
design, known as the thermal management is more and more important part of any
design process in electronics industry. One can find that effective draining the heat off
the source to ambient becomes the problem of the greatest importance, as one must
keep the safe work temperature [1,2]. According to the general assumptions
concerning the MOSFET IPM under consideration, the analysed system covered
50x40 mm2 IMS (Insulated Metal Substrate) plate as the substrate on which two
MOSFET Toshiba transistors 2SK2866 in TO-220AB packages were to be placed
symmetrically and fastened by soldering technique.
The investigations were aimed to evaluate the influence of the particular design of the
transistor location versus the steady-state thermal feature of the considered IPM.

2 Thermal Model of IPM
The Fig. 1 introduces two possible designs of the module with two considered
layouts for the transistor packages. The both designs use the IMS substrate that is
introduced in Fig. 2. section. The preliminary simulations proved that the layout
introduced in Fig. 1 a) should be considered as the optimal one, so the further
simulations were led for this layout. As the structure is fully symmetrical, only one of
its halves is taken to further investigations.

The final view of the 3-D thermal model of IPM used in the simulations is shown
in Fig.3. It covers one half of the IPM with the transistor fastened by a homogeneous
solder layer to the IMS plate. In the transistor thermal model three elements are
distinguished only. There are the bottom copper layer (lead frame) soldered to the
copper foil of IMS, the silicon chip placed on the lead frame and the epoxy layer
covering the silicon chip.

The Table 1 collects dimensions of the elements for the model from Fig.3. The copper
foil length and width are not determined since they can vary depending on the circuit
pattern and they are one of the parameters changed during the investigations. The
physical parameters of the materials the parts are made from are collected in the
Table.2. It has been assumed that the thermal conductivity of silicon can vary
according to the actual temperature in the following way:

λ = at T −b
where: at=4350, b=1.4, and T is the temperature [K].

In the model, it has been assumed that the silicon chip is the only heat source in which
the heat is dissipated homogeneously. The magnitude of heat dissipation has been
fixed on the base of Toshiba transistor 2SK2866a data sheet [3]. Taking into account
its catalogue maximum ratings, so called the PD drain power dissipation has been
chosen as equal to125W, which gives the heat generation of 18.1e9 W/m3 when taking
into account the volume of the silicon chip.
The boundary conditions for the border planes have been chosen according to their
role in the heat exchange in the real IPM construction. For the plane that corresponds
to the symmetry axis the adiabatic boundary condition is the only one that can be
applied. For the rest of border planes the boundary conditions using the ambient
temperature Ta as the reference one have been used. It is the isothermal one for the
bottom of IMS substrate aluminium layer, which is usually kept at the ambient
temperature and the convection one for the other surfaces. In the simulation the
convection coefficient of 7 W/m2K that is typical for free convection inside a wellventilated case and the ambient temperature equalled to 250C has been used.
The full geometry of the considered structure was introduced to Preprocessor of
Ansys 5.7 software [4] and all the material properties as well. The manual meshing
was chosen to optimize the mesh according to the areas of the greatest interest. Fig. 3
shows the introduced model, and Fig. 4 the optimized mesh.

3 The Simulation Results
We aimed to find the critical value for the Cu foil surface for the heat disposal, and
to obtain the results we considered five different dimensions (see Table 1) outward to

the TO-220AB package; i.e. 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm, 4 mm, whole surface. The
maximum temperature (always on the top part of the silicon chip) cannot exceed
1250C as it is the upper edge of the permitted temperature range that allows the
devices to operate safely.

The Fig. 5 introduces the example of maximum temperature distribution for the
structure (a – end view; b – section), where the Cu layer exceeds the surface of TO220AB by 4 mm. The case when Cu covers the whole surface was checked to make
no difference comparing to 4 mm. The figures 6 and 7 show calculated curves of the
thermal resistance and the maximum temperature versus the copper width. Checking
the temperature distribution, one sees that for the copper width less than 4 mm the
possible temperature is exceeded, even for these ideal conditions of the heat removal.
Only for 4 mm width the maximum temperature in the silicon chip gains the value of
1240C and assures the safe operation of the electronic devices. The temperature does
not lower when one enlarges the copper surface more than 4 mm. So the heat
conditions are stable then.
To estimate the heat dissipation in the whole structure we prepared the heat vector
diagram (Figs. 8 and 9). The Figure 8 introduces the heat flow for the case when
copper covers 1 mm path beyond the transistor package surface, and the Figure 9 the
one when the Cu path width amounts to 4 mm. The further widening of copper did not
give any changes in the heat flow distribution.

4 Conclusions
The simulations have been led with the assumption that the temperature at the bottom
of the whole package equals to an ambient one (250C), i.e. the cooling method is very
efficient. Also the assumption of the convection coefficient at the value of 7 W/m2K
can be valid for efficient ventilating, only. That is why, the results should be
considered as made in good cooling conditions. If any real conditions are worse, the
maximum power range should not be obtained if the silicon is to be kept in a safe
temperature. The maximum temperature value for silicon (1250C) should be met then,
without any exceptions. The simulations showed that the surface covered by Cu is
very important here. If the circuit design does not allow to cover the surface with Cu
in a sufficient way, the heat cannot be removed when the maximum power is applied.
The width of 4 mm has resulted from our simulations.
