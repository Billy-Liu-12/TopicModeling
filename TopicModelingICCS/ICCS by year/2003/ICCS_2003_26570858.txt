Abstract. Kepler’s generalized equation is a transcendental nonlinear
equation that must be solved in order to compute the position and velocity of an artiﬁcial satellite at any instant t. In this paper, we propose
a method to solve analytically that equation. The method is based on
the properties of non canonical Lie transformations and, under certain
conditions, it is shown that it gives better results than numerical methods.

Introduction

The design of spatial missions requires the development of analytical theories in
order to place an artiﬁcial satellite in orbit around a planet. These theories are
particularly appreciated by mission analysis engineers at space agencies.
ATESAT [1,2,13] is a symbolic software that automatically generates analytical theories for the orbital motion of satellites. This software makes extensively
use of Lie transformations [6] applied to the original problem (a mass point under
the gravitational ﬁeld of a planet) in order to generate automatically the symbolic expressions of the equations of motion as well as the C-code to compute the
position and velocity (ephemeris) for the satellite. It is currently implemented
at the Centre National d’Etudes Spatials (CNES) of Toulouse (France) and is
used in mission analysis for orbiters around the Earth and Mars. Among these
transformations used in ATESAT, let us mention the elimination of the parallax
[8], the elimination of the perigee [5], and the Krylov-Bogoliuvob-Mitropolsky
(KBM) method [9,10]. The description of these transformations is beyond the
scope of this paper and will not be included here; more details can be found in
the original papers or in [2,3] and references therein. Let us mention, that after
the application of this set of transformations, the problem is greatly simpliﬁed
and reduced to a perturbed harmonic oscillator [3]. In this way, it is possible
to reach high orders of precision, with the advantage that, once the theory is
obtained, the evaluation of the position or velocity vectors is just a matter of
evaluating a time function (see e.g. [4]).
When we try to solve by analytical means, this new problem, we meet a
transcendental equation whose solution must be obtained. This equation is similar to the Kepler’s classical equation in the two-body problem, and this is why

the new equation is called Kepler’s generalized equation. These equations are
usually solved numerically, but for some speciﬁc values of the parameters, the
convergence is poor and some subtle details must be taken into account.
Let us remind that the Kepler’s classical equation is
= n(t − T ) = E − e sin E,

(1)

where it relates the mean anomaly , or the time t, to the eccentric anomaly E
and the eccentricity e of the orbit. The solution of this equation, that is, ﬁnding
E for a given value of time (or ) is an operation that we have to perform each
time we want to know the position (or the distance) of the satellite at any instant
t. This equation cannot be directly inverted in terms of simple functions because
it is transcendental in E. The only way to express analytically E in terms of
is by means of a power series expansion of the eccentricity that diverges for
values of e > 0.6627434. Many algorithms have been developed to solve Kepler’s
equation due to its relevance for Celestial Mechanics and Astrodynamics.
A way to solve it is to apply Lagrange’s inversion theorem: Let y be deﬁned
as a function of x in terms of a parameter α by y = x + αφ(y), Lagrange’s
inversion theorem ensures that y can be expressed as a function of x as a power
series in α. In [7] we ﬁnd a more general formulation of the Lagrange’s inversion theorem, based on non-canonical Lie transformations, very useful to solve
Kepler’s equation.
For our part, in this Note, we present an analytical method to solve Kepler’s
generalized equation. This equation coincides with the classical one when the
small parameter of the perturbation expansion in the orbit is = 0. Our
approach is a method to invert symbolically Kepler’s generalized equation. The
solution that we propose is completely formulated in terms of non-canonical Lie
transformations. We apply our algorithm to some practical examples, showing
that the results obtained with our method are better than those obtained with
numerical ones.

A First Order Solution of the Main Problem of the
Artiﬁcial Satellite

The Keplerian orbit of an artiﬁcial satellite is perturbed by the non sphericity
of the planet. It is modeled by the value of its potential harmonics. The most
important eﬀect an the orbit is generally due to the oblateness of the planet, and
the corresponding harmonic is the second order zonal harmonic J2 . The model
of the orbit of a satellite perturbed only by J2 is called main problem of the
satellite.
The most adequate set of variables to formulate this problem are the Whittaker’s or polar-nodal variables (r, θ, ν, R, Θ, N ), where r is the radial distance
from the planet’s mass center to the satellite, θ is the argument of latitude, and ν
is the argument of the ascending node. The variables R, Θ, N are the conjugate
momenta to the coordinates r, θ, ν, respectively (see Figure 1).

The Hamiltonian of the main problem expressed in Whittaker’s or polarnodal variables (see Deprit, [8], for details) is

µ is the gravitational constant, α is the equatorial radius of the planet, i is
the angle of intersection between the orbital plane and the equator and the
parameter represents the oblateness J2 of the Earth.
In [3] we show a complete second order integration of this problem. However,
the expression involved in such theory is very extremely large and we only present
here the ﬁrst order. First, we apply two canonical transformations that reduce
to one the number of degrees of freedom. After that, the Krylov-BogoliuvovMitropolski technique is applied to integrate the problem.
The elimination of the parallax [8] is the ﬁrst canonical transformation implemented. It reduces the complexity of the subsequent calculations when going
up to higher orders. The second canonical transformation is the elimination of
the perigee [5]. It removes the argument of the perigee from the Hamiltonian
giving the expression

A more detailed version of this process can be found in [3]. We show there
all the expressions of the main problem up to the order two. The same process
can be applied to greater orders and more complex models considering not only
the oblateness of the planet, but any zonal potential harmonic of the planet. In
all the cases, we obtain a generalized Kepler’s equation of the form

As we can see in the previous deﬁnition and properties, a Lie transformation
is a near identity transformation that can be characterized indistinctly by its
explicit expression or its generator. The Lie triangle applied to the function
F (x, ) = x obtains the explicit expression from the generator.
A detailed description of the properties and applications of these transformations can be found in Kamel [12], Henrard [11] and Deprit [6].

Inversion of Kepler’s Generalized Equation

To illustrate the inversion of Kepler’s generalized equation we use (4) as a starting point. Like in the Kepler’s classical equation, we look for an expression of the
eccentric anomaly E in terms of the mean anomaly as an expansion in powers
of the eccentricity e. To this aim, we expand (4) in powers of e up to the sixth
order in the form

where the coeﬃcients of the expansion are expansions in powers of the small
parameter up to the the order of the theory, in this case, order one. We choose
order six in the expansion in powers of e to obtain the machine precision in the
numerical evaluation of this approximation.
Using the arithmetic of power series, we divide it by (1 + K ) and obtain the
expression

Equation (12) has the form of an explicit non canonical Lie transformation. An application of the second proposition gives the generator of the inverse
transformation. Finally, the ﬁrst proposition gives the explicit expression of the
inverse of (12), that is equal to

Eventually, we will go from to using again the arithmetic of power series

Numerical Evaluation

In order to compute the ephemeris of a satellite using the model previously
described we have to solve numerically the Kepler’s generalized equation. The

Symbolic Solution of Kepler’s Generalized Equation

865

classical solution for Kepler’s equation is to apply Newton’s method by the
iterative formula
f (Ei )
,
Ei+1 = Ei −
f (Ei )
where f (E) = E − − e sin E, but methods to improve the convergence of this
equation appear frequently in the literature due to the relevance of the equation
in the ﬁeld of orbital motion.
We may apply the same method to Kepler’s generalized equation, with a
function f (E) deﬁned by
f (E) = E − − e sin E + G(e, E; ).
When we apply this method there are convergence problems that lead to erroneous determinations of the position of the satellite.
We may use the formula (13) to evaluate Kepler’s generalized equation when
eccentricity values are small. For instance, in the real case of a Spot satellite
(e = 0.01 ), in the computation of ephemeris for a period of 60 days, the error
generated by the use of the analytical approximation instead of the numerical
method was about 6 × 10−5 , 6 × 10−7 , 6 × 10−9 , 8 × 10−11 , 1 × 10−12 , 1 × 10−13
for a development in e of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively.
