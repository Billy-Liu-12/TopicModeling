Abstract. Estimation of the highest disparity value is very important for proper
operation of any stereo matching algorithm. Choice of a too big or too small
disparity range may cause severe errors in an output disparity map. A guess of
this parameter by human is the method which is used very often during
experiments, however it is not suitable in real time or autonomous vision
systems. In the same way, a usage of the constant disparity range gives often
poor results. The paper describes a innovative method of the automatic
estimation of a maximum disparity for the real time stereo imaging systems.
After short review of the most popular methods of the maximum disparity
estimation, we present our method based on the variogram analysis. Finally the
experimental results for the real images are also presented.

1 Introduction
During many experiments with the stereoscopic algorithms we have found, that right
choice of the maximum disparity threshold value is crucial to the quality of the output
disparity map and also influences the computation time [2][4]. Choice of a too small
value leads to false disparity map with many errors, whereas too big disparity range
causes large errors as well, because of high amount of the false matches. Furthermore,
selection of the disparity range should adapt to the true distance to the matched object.
At the other hand, if we consider computation effort, then we obtain that smaller
values for this parameter give shorter calculations time [1].
Having this in mind we have found that the estimation of the maximum disparity
threshold is a critical problem for the real time stereo matching systems – for example
a vision system which navigates blind person in real word. In this work we try to find
solution of this problem. We rely on the statistic method – the variogram calculation
and compare this approach to the ideal disparity estimation made by human [2].

2 Review of the Methods of the Maximum Disparity Estimation
In many stereo systems the disparity value was selected in the arbitrary way, due to
the estimated geometry of the video acquisition system and the expected parameters
of the analyzed scene. It is possible to rely on the theory which allows to limit top
boundary of the disparity value to the difference between horizontal size of the picture
and the current horizontal position (for a canonical stereo setup).
First solution to the estimation of the maximum disparity value were found to be an
iteration method. This method uses fast but not very accurate matching algorithm to
find the first estimate of the disparity range [2]. The subsequent stereo algorithm uses
results of the first one. An another approach was proposed by Scharstein [6]. He
suggest to cumulate gradient values of the quarter, then for the whole picture and
based on this conjure the maximum disparity. Third solution is a scale-space approach
[1][7] which allows to estimate disparity in different scales and then find the starting
estimate. Described methods show that we can look for solution of the disparity range
problem by performing the following operations on the picture:
• changing resolution of the picture and making disparity analysis in some
regions,
• changing scale of the analysis,
• using more than one method on the unchanged picture.
Listed methods may be classified as a deterministic approaches. An opposite is a
statistical approach which will be explored in this paper.

3 Image Analysis by Variograms
If we want to find a disparity between two images then we are interested in examining
the spatial structure of a both images what can be stated in a form of an analysis of so
called a regionalized variable [8]. One way to do this is to analytically relate the
change of this variables as a function of some separating distance h. The solution of
this problem may be in a form of a variogram, which defines a spatial correlation or
structure of a regionalized function and is given by [5][8]:

K =

(

)

1
2
E [ f ( x ) − f ( x + h )] = C (0) − C ( h )
2

(1)

where C(h) is the covariance function, E the mathematical expectation and h the
separating distance.
Shape of the variogram reflects the degree of correlation between samples of
images. Variogram functions that rise as h increases indicates that the spatial
correlation decreases as more distant samples are chosen, until a separation distance is
reached at which knowledge of one sample tells us nothing about another ones [8].
For two dimensional signals – such as images – the variogram was defined by
Ramstein as follows:

K =

where: Nc and Nr are respectively the number of rows and columns of the image, and h

In this paper we propose a modification to the equation (2) – we define variograms
for the two images (stereo pair) as follows:

4 Disparity Range Estimation Based on Variogram Analysis
As alluded to previously, in a case of the calculation of a variogram for two images
(3), we expect to find correlation if pictures belong to a single stereo-pair. In other
words, each displacement will increase a total decorrelation value between images.
Relying on this observation, after many experiments with variograms, authors have
found some heuristic rule which allows to estimate maximum disparity value
according to the following algorithm:
1) find value h for which the variogram (3) reaches the first local minima,
2) increase h about 10-20% to obtain an approximated value for a maximum
disparity range of a given stereo-pair.
This heuristic rule may be justified by the observation that appearance of strong
local minima corresponds to the high amount of points in a stereo pair with
displacement equal to the argument h. It should be noticed that a value which was
found with this method may not be a global maximum, because of the statistic nature
of the calculations. However experimental results show that this method works in
practice for most of real images.
4.1 Experimental Results of the Heuristic Variogram Analysis
Presented hereafter experiments are based on real stereo pairs depicted in Fig. 1. The
images Fiesta, Phone and Street may be found as extremely difficult for matching,
because of their content and imperfect way of the acquisition. The picture Trees is an
interesting case due to very small disparity range.
In Fig. 2 we present variograms calculated for the tested stereo pairs.

For verification purposes, independently three persons with special software have
estimated maximum disparity for the test pictures. Average values obtained by
humans were compared with result obtained with the proposed method – comparison
may be seen in Table 1.

Modifications to the Variogram Analysis

Obtained results are not satisfactory due to the obtained error range (see Table 1). We
noticed that some improvements in our algorithm can be made by the following
generalization of the variogram definition:
K (h) =

1
2 N cN r

Nc N r

∑∑ K (I , I
l

r

, x, y , h )

(4)

x =1 y =1

where K(Il, Ir, x, y, h) is the kernel for the variogram. In the case of the classic
definition (3), the varigram kernel is simply equal to the following:

K(I l , I r , x, y, h) = [I l (x + h, y ) − I r ( x, y )]

2

(5)

In the case of the variogram, it can be said, that for the given disparity value h, we
perform operations defined by the kernel K(Il, Ir, x, y, h) in both images, and we sum
and scale obtained result in the next step.
If we compare the Sum of Squared Differences metrics (SSD) given by the
equation:
M =

∑ (I

( x , y )∈U

1

( x, y ) − I 2 ( x + d x , y + d y )

)

2

(6)

where U denotes local neighborhoods and dx, dy disparity values in both directions,
than we will find that for the dy = 0 we obtain a classic variogram kernel given by (5).
By observed analogy we decided to make the analysis of the different kernels
K(Il, Ir, x, y, h) forms based on the area-based stereo matching algorithms. We present
all tested kernels in Table 2.

All new variogram kernels were tested with the stereo pairs. Results of this tests
for the exemplary Rubic stereo pair are presented in Fig. 3.
During experiments we have found that SCP and SCP-N kernels give output with
falling characteristics. The SCP measure is more interesting because of the lower
requirements on a computation power.

Disparity Range Estimation Based on the SCP Variogram

Based on the observations about new variogram kernels we decided to use the SCP
kernel. After many experiments with this variogram, we have found next heuristic
rule which allows to estimate maximum disparity value as follows:
• find the integer value h which corresponds to the 0.94 value of the variogram
• take h as the maximum disparity range.
This rule seems to be better than previous because:
• there is no need to look for the local minima,
• there is no need to make any modification of the h value.
Results of the tests for the presented stereo-pairs are presented in the Fig. 4.
Comparison with the true disparity ranges defined by the human is presented in
Table 3.

7 Conclusions
A new method of the automatic estimation of the maximum disparity range with the
variogram was invented. In this paper we found correlation between local minima of

600

the variogram and value of the maximum disparity range. This method provides also a
novel way of the variogram definition for the stereo images. The definition of the
variogram kernel was also presented. In next stage of experiments the variogram
kernel was modified due to its similarity to the measures used in the area-based stereo
methods. New results obtained with modified SPC kernels allow to decrease
estimation range error. All benefits make this method very attractive as an automatic
estimation of a threshold parameter for almost any stereo-method.
Finally, an analysis of the methods was presented that showed usefulness of the
presented concepts.
