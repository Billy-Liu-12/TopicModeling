Abstract. A 0-D (box type) mathematical flushing model and a threedimensional baroclinic numerical model have been presented that are used to
simulate transport processes in coastal waters. The numerical model consists of
hydrodynamic, transport and turbulence model components. In the hydrodynamic
model component, the Navier-Stokes equations are solved with the Boussinesq
approximation. The transport model component consists of the pollutant transport
model and the water temperature and salinity transport models. In this
component, the three dimensional convective diffusion equations are solved for

formulation is solved to calculate the kinetic energy of the turbulence and its rate
of dissipation, which provides the variable vertical turbulent eddy viscosity.
Horizontal eddy viscosity can be simulated by the Smagorinsky algebraic sub-grid
scale turbulence model. The solution method is a composite finite differencefinite element method. In the horizontal plane finite difference approximations
and in the vertical plane finite element shape functions are used. The governing
equations are solved implicitly in the Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal
mesh sizes can be variable. To increase the vertical resolution, grid clustering can
be applied. In the treatment of coastal land boundaries, the flooding and drying
processes can be considered. The developed numerical model predictions are
verified by the hydraulic model studies conducted on the forced flushing of
marinas in enclosed seas.

1 Introduction
Tide, wind, fresh water inflow, gravitation, macro instabilities and waves are the six
basic mechanisms which produce motion and mixing in water bodies. Along Turkish
shores the tidal ranges are typically from 0.1 m. to 0.3 m., which are quite low values for
sufficient levels of water exchanges. Therefore, lower frequency motions due to wind or
fresh water inflow are dominant throughout the Turkish shores. Gravitational movement
superposes over the effects of wind and the fresh water inflow.
In recent years, there have been a lot of studies performed on 0-Dimensional
(box type water exchange, 2-Dimensional (depth averaged) and 3-Dimensional (full
picture) transport models. 0-D numerical models do not pay attention to the internal
hydraulics within the water body [1],[2]. The most simplifying assumption of the model

is the complete and uniform mixing of the pollutant at any time with water present in the
water body. 2-D numerical models, where the flow is depth averaged, can be
successfully used to simulate circulation, when density differences do not play a
significant role. Tidal circulation in coastal areas is a typical example. Such models are
also used for designing optimal layout of marinas to assure sufficient flushing. The use
of 3-D models is unavoidable in all cases where the influence of density distribution, or
vertical velocity variations can not be neglected. Inflow of lower salinity river plumes
into coastal sea is a typical example, but often also in the simulation of tidal flows the
influence of density differences can not be neglected. In cases of wind driven flows in
smaller areas near the shore, the depth-averaged 2-D models can not simulate the 3-D
character of the flow. With wind-driven flows the density stratification causes an
additional effect: an important diminishing of the shear stress between the horizontal
layers, the consequence being that the surface layer circulation can differ considerably
from the depth averaged circulation. Strong stratification in water bodies usually also
demands the use of 3-D models [3]. In this paper a 0-D flushing model proposed for
enclosed water bodies and a 3-D fully implicit transport model have been presented.

2 Zero Dimensional, Box Type Flushing Model
A non-conservative substance with a first order decay reaction is considered. Its
concentration is Co at the start of the computations. The intrusion of the pollutant into the
coastal water body continues at a constant rate P. As the model is zero dimensional, the
pollutant concentration is assumed not to vary spatially. This requires complete mixing
inside the water body at all times. The model equation, stating the conservation of the
pollutant mass in the enclosed water body is written as [1],[2],[4]:
dC

P
= ‚àí ( k + )C +
(1)

in which, C: the instantaneous pollutant concentration; k: decay coefficient; Q: entering

When the flushing is due to the tidal discharge alone, the bulk conservation
equation becomes:

The zero dimensional model presented above is applied to √ñl√ºdeniz Lagoon.
√ñl√ºdeniz Lagoon is an example of choked lagoons [8]. The lagoon is connected to the
sea by a single narrow and shallow channel. This entrance channel serves as a dynamic
filter and tidal currents are damped out. In the Mediterranean Sea tidal ranges are
typically in the order of 0.2 to 0.3 meters. Despite the smallness of the tidal amplitude, a
considerable level of flushing is induced by the tidal motion [6].
Flushing of √ñl√ºdeniz lagoon is controlled primarily by the two processes:
firstly the tidal action and secondly the wind driven currents. Density driven currents
are rather weak compared to the tide and wind induced currents [7]. Tidal motion at
the site of √ñl√ºdeniz Lagoon is typically semi-diurnal. The mean tidal range is about
0.15m and the tidal period is 12 hours and 25 minutes. Lagoon is rather deep with a
mean water depth of 17 m. In the middle of the lagoon, the water depth reaches about
40m.
The model provides a quick assessment of the degree of tidal flushing to be
expected. The mean depth of the lagoon is 17 m. and the surface area is about 406000
m2. The tidal motion at the site of √ñl√ºdeniz Lagoon is semi-diurnal type. The mean
tidal range is about 0.15 m., which is typical around the Turkish Mediterranean
coastline. The flushing parameter has a value of 227. The Cn/Co ratios are computed
for a conservative pollutant and results are plotted in Figure 1. This figure depicts the
situation that if no pollutant is introduced into the lagoon (i.e. for Ca/Co=0), it takes
261days for the pollutant amount in the lagoon to be flushed out by the tidal currents
alone up to level of 99 %, i.e. to have the value of Cn/Co=1%. If the pollutant continues

198

entering the lagoon waters, the flushing period of the lagoon gets much longer.
Furthermore, it is computed that Cn=Co for all times if the pollutant addition rate is such
that Ca/Co=0.0044. As it is observed from Figure 1, the cleansing of the lagoon can
not be realized at all if Ca/Co=0.

3 Three Dimensional Numerical Model
An unsteady three-dimensional baroclinic circulation model (HIDROTAM3) has been
developed to simulate the transport processes in coastal water bodies [3]. The model
predictions were verified by using several experimental and analytical results published
in the literature and its successful use for a variety of real life cases was demonstrated
[3][8][10].

square, with prototype dimensions of 432mx432m. The tidal range was 0.1 m and tidal
period was 708 s. Dye was injected into the enclosed basin to provide an initial uniform
concentration across the basin. Dye experimental results and numerical model
predictions at low tide for the first cycle and for the second cycle are presented in Figure
(2) and in Figure (3) respectively.

Centroidal distribution is well predicted by the model. However, close to the harbor
entrance, the predicted concentrations are about 17% higher than the measurements. The
main reason for this may be the estimation of rather weak flow and small eddies close to
the open boundary. Overall the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the
experimental results.

5 Forced Flushing of Marinas in Enclosed Seas
Construction of a marina disturbs the natural flow patterns and normally deteriorates
the water quality in and around the project site [3]. Water enclosed in a marina basin
is normally tranquil and has a restricted contact with the outside sea. Water exchange
takes place only through the entrance. The cross sectional area of the entrance is
often small and the exchange is low especially in areas where the tidal range is small.
Water, which enters into the basin, can not freely circulate. Limited water circulation
may result in poor water quality levels in the marina. It is often necessary to apply
some special design features to enhance flushing of marinas. The use of a "MorningGlory Spillway" like structure to pump out water from the marina for improving the
flushing performance is investigated. A physical model study was performed in the
Coastal Engineering Laboratory of the Middle East Technical University. The measured
velocities in the physical model at the grid points neighboring the intake are used as the
boundary conditions in the mathematical model. The length scale of the model was 1/50.
The length and width of the rectangular model marina basin were 5.80 m. and 2.8 m.,
respectively. The average water depth was 0.2 m. Using the length scale of 1/50, these
dimensions correspond to a prototype marina of 290 m by 140 m., with a water depth of
10 m. Surface water was withdrawn from the marina by installing a structure similar to
the morning-glory spillway. The water taken from the basin was pumped into the open
sea. The discharge point was selected so that, the motion resulting from the pumped
water does not affect the circulation in the basin. Velocity measurements were taken
with a ‚ÄôMinilab SD-12‚Äô microscale 3-axis ultrasonic current meter. The morning glory
shaped intake structure was placed at various locations in the basin. Two of them, which
are at the corners, are presented in this paper. The choice of the corner locations is due to
the concern for affecting the maneuvering space of the crafts inside the marina. The grid
system used has a square mesh size of 10x10 m. The vertical eddy viscosity is calculated

turbulence model. At t=0, the pump is started, so that the water begins to flow in the
intake, whereas the remaining part of the water body is assumed to be at rest and the
water surface is assumed to be horizontal. The land boundaries are taken as fixed
boundaries. Velocities measured in the physical model at the grid points neighboring the
intake are used as the boundary conditions of the intake location in the mathematical
model. Steady state conditions are reached approximately 1.5 hours after the start of
pumping. The paths followed by the floats in the physical model are compared with the
results obtained from the mathematical model in Figures (4-5). The velocity distributions
at the surface layer as obtained from the mathematical model are also shown. The
average velocities along the paths followed by the floats in both physical and
mathematical models are compared in Table (1). In Case I, the intake structure is placed
on the right end corner of the marina (135 m. x 285 m.). The best agreement is
obtained for the path followed by the float number 2 released at location (100 m. x 0
m.) with an average velocity relative error of 0.55%. The highest relative error in the
average velocity is calculated as 24.4% for the float number 7 which released at
location (30 m. x 10 m.). For this path, the velocities predicted by the numerical
model are less than the velocities observed in the physical model.

There is a dead zone where the released float does not move through the intake, since
there occurs a gyre. Therefore, the float number 7 follows a counter clockwise
elliptical route. The location of dead zone is almost the same for physical and
numerical models.

In Case II, the intake structure is placed on the left end corner of the marina (5
m. x 285 m.). The closest agreement in the path trajectory is obtained for the float
number 8, which is released at location (130 m. x 240 m.). However, the relative error in
its average velocity is the highest, 29 %. In the physical model, a dead zone is observed
in the left-hand side of the basin towards the middle of the y-axis. On the other hand, the
dead zone predicted by the numerical model is on the left entrance corner of the basin
and it occupies a rather restricted area. The pumping operation should be carried out
during flood tide only to derive the greatest efficiency from such a system. The best
location of the intake for removal of water and the optimum discharge rate are two
crucial issues for designing such a scheme. The first question becomes especially
important in the case of complex basins where the problems of "dead regions" are
normally more significant. Such features have traditionally been investigated in physical
models.

6 Conclusions
By assuming complete and uniform mixing of the pollutant at any time with the water
present in the lagoon, zero dimensional model is applied to the √ñl√ºdeniz Lagoon. This
assumption is a crude assumption for the √ñl√ºdeniz lagoon, which is rather deep.

204

However the zero dimensional mathematical model provides a quick assessment of the
degree of tidal flushing to be expected. It shows that flushing due to tidal motion alone is
not sufficient for maintaining an acceptable water quality in the lagoon. Secondly, a
three dimensional numerical model which consists of hydrodynamic, transport and
turbulence model components has been presented. Three-dimensional modeling is
necessary for investigating lagoon flushing due to mechanisms other than tide, such as
wind and density currents. The presented three dimensional model is a valuable design
tool and can be implemented in a Decision Support System. It may be used in diverse
coastal applications including the prediction of natural flushing rates caused by tidal
motion, wind effect, density currents or a fresh water inflow.
