Abstract. The optimal numerical realization of the energy balance equation in
wind wave models is proposed. The scheme is separated into two parts: the
numerical source term integration and the energy propagation numerical
realization. The first one is based on a spreading numerical method. Semianalytical solution is used for integration of source term, which includes the
wind wave input, dissipation term and exact non-linear energy transfer function.
The energy propagation numerical realization is based on the utilisation of the
diffusive operator, which is implemented in the semi-Lagrangian numerical
method. It gives opportunity to remove the garden-sprinkler effect of the energy
balance equation solution for the case of wind wave propagation in the ocean.
The new technique yields accurate results and has the additional advantage of
being numerically stable, thereby allowing the use of a large time step (three
hours and more). The method could be regarded as a general alternative for the
numerical realization of energy balance equation in the models.

1 Introduction
The successful solution of the hindcast or forecast wind wave problem depends on the
quality of physical model and on the equation numerical realization in the
mathematical modelling. The errors of the solution depend on the accuracy of wind
speed calculation as well. Nevertheless the errors of the energy balance equation
numerical realization can be no less than the errors coming from the wind value
accuracy and from the unsatisfactory implementation of the wind wave physics in the
model [1,2,3,4,6,7]. In the present study the optimal numerical realization of the
energy balance equation in wind wave models is proposed, which gives an
opportunity to get reliable results by using sufficient large time step of numerical
integration.

The scheme of numerical realization of the energy balance equation (1) with (2) is
separated into two parts: the energy propagation numerical realization and the
numerical source term integration.

3 Numerical Scheme of the Wave Energy Propagation
The numerical solution of the energy balance equation (1) requires the discretization
of the continuous wave spectrum S( ω ,β ) in the frequency-direction space. The
mean energy contained in the frequency ( ωk - 0.5∆ω ≤ ω ≤ ωk +0.5ω ) and in the
direction bands

( β l - 0.5∆β ≤ β ≤ β l + 0.5∆β ) can be determined as:

Unlike to (1) the equation (5) contains correction terms of first order of small
parameters ε and δ , which allow taking into account the fine value of the angular
and frequency discretization of spectrum.
Using (2) and (5) one can derive the energy balance equation, which includes the

L is scale of wave propagation. The term correcting the left side of the energy transfer
equation (6) is approximated by a simple angular diffusive operator, which describes
a slight "exchange" of the energy between the nearest angular components.
The numerical realization of the energy propagation part of the equation (1) results in
numerical solution of the equation (5) or (6). The numerical scheme is based on semiLagrangian method in combination with utilisation of angular diffusive operator
(INTERPOL method [4,5]).
Let us consider the swell propagation to the South from the initial disturbance, which

θ 0 = 00 ,ϕ 0 = 720 . The wave height partial distribution is
function exp(-δr/ Lmax ), where δr is the distance from

centre is located at point
approximated by the

centre, Lmax is a correlation radius. The significant wave height at the centre is 10m,
mean wave period is 15 s. The propagation problem is solved by different methods:
analytically, using the first order upwind scheme (FOUS), which is used in the WAM
model [3], and by the INTERPOL method as well.
The initial partial distribution of significant wave height is shown in fig.1a. The wave
height distributions after 24 h of propagation obtained by the analytical solution, the
FOUS and the INTERPOL method (the latter two both using 12 directions and a time
step of 30 min) are presented in fig.1b, 1c and 1d, respectively). In the FOUS and, to
a lesser extent, the INTERPOL results, most of the wave energy tends to concentrate

182

along the model direction nearest to the initial direction of propagation. In this
direction wave heights are overestimated, while they are underpredicted in other
directions. This is “garden-sprinkler” effect [1,4,5] caused by the crude angular
resolution of the model. For FOUS solution with 12 directions the local errors can rise
to 40% in the direction of wave propagation, and to -35% in other directions. During
time the errors along the model direction nearest to the path of propagation grow to
+25% within 12 h, and at certain points exceed the +90% level at t=48 h. The
negative error levels involve in a less spectacular manner, from peak values of 1520% at t=12 to -40% at t=48 h of propagation. Increasing the number of directions in
the FOUS to 24 reduces the error levels by roughly half. The INTERPOL method
with 12 directions is in better agreement with the analytical solution than its FOUS
counterpart; its accuracy is comparable to that of the FOUS with 24 directions.

Fig. 1. The spatial distribution of wave heights: 1a - initial distribution at t=0 h; 1b - analytical
solution at t=24 h, 1c - solution by FOUS with 12 direction at t=24 h, 1d - INTERPOL solution
(with 12 directions and a time step of 30 minutes) at t=24h.

The INTERPOL method with 24 directions also reduces the error levels by half.
Fig.2 shows the temporal evolution of the total wave energy ∑(t) , its mean
location < ϕ (t) > , the spatial spreading function θ (t) and root mean square error
RMSE. Both the FOUS and INTERPOL schemes are able to reproduce the behaviour
of the total energy and mean position of the wave disturbance fairly well (fig.2a, 2b).
At the beginning stages of wave propagation all methods give a growing up RMSE
level (fig.2d). The error achieves 8% level at 12 h and 20% at 40 h for FOUS with 12

directions. The double increasing of the number of directions diminishes errors by
halves for the final stage of wave propagation, but for the beginning stage the error
level remains approximately the same. The INTERPOL method with 12 directions
and the same time step of 20 minutes gives 5% error at t=12.5 hours and 12% at 40
hours. The increasing of the time step up to 3 h gives 3% RMSE at t=12 h and 11%
error at 40 h and 10% for 6-h time step. So, the increasing of the time step diminishes
the error level.

4 Numerical Realization of Source Term Numerical Integration
The second step in total numerical scheme is the numerical realization of the source
term integration. The scheme for the next source term is developed:

G = Gin + Gnl + Gds

Gin is the function, describing a wind input, it depends linearly on
spectrum Gin = A S [3], where A is the function of frequency ω  angle of spectral
r
component propagation β and wind speed U . Gnl is the exact form of the nonwhere

linear energy transfer computed by optimal algorithms based on the numerical method
of integration of the highest precision [4]; Gds is the function of energy dissipation,


it consists of two components Gds = Gds + Gds . The first * GV is a dissipation
mechanism due to white capping, it is the non-linear function of the wave spectrum, it

depends on wind speed as well:

Gds1 = − A S γ +1 (where γ = γ (ω )) . The second

component of dissipation is the linear function of the wave spectrum. It doesn’t

Gds2 = − B S , B is the function of frequency ω  angle of
spectral component propagation β . It can depend on slowly varying integral

depend on the wind:

parameters of the wave spectrum [3].
For the numerical integrating of the source term a spreading algorithm is used. It
consists of two steps. At first the simple first order Euler’s scheme (or it can be semiimplicit numerical scheme [3] as well) is applied for the numerical integration of
equation

where 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 .
At the second step the next finite difference equation is solved

S n+1 − S n+ ρ

The solution of the equation (9) could be approximated analytically as

(

S n+1 = S n+ ρ A ( S n+ ρ )γ ± 1 − A ( S n+ ρ )γ e −γ B ∆t

The numerical experiments show that numerical scheme (8)-(10) is able to produce
stable numerical results by using time step 1, 3, and 6 hours instead of time step in 20
minutes used in the WAM model. That is why in the present numerical scheme there
is no need to introduce any restriction on the wave spectrum and source function
numerical values. Such restriction used to include in traditional numerical scheme,
because of instability of numerical results [2,3].
Fig.3 presents the test results of numerical simulations for the frequency spectrum at
t = 30 h duration. The same computations were carried out by the second-order
numerical scheme (Adam’s method) for the different time step of numerical
integration. The comparison results show that results of the second-order numerical
scheme for time step in 3 min practically coincide with those of spreading method

(8)-(10) for time step in 1 h. By increasing the time step up to 3 and 6 hours the
numerical value of frequency spectrum remains stable. It is less only by 10% for time
step in 3 h and by 17% for time step in 6 h than appropriate value for time step in 1 h.
Fig.4 shows the results of changing the total energy during time for the same
methods. The comparison results present the high accuracy of the method (8)-(10) for
the time step in 1 h and 3 h. For large time step the total increasing of energy becomes
smaller because of underestimation of non-linear energy transfer contribution.

The optimal numerical realization of the energy balance equation in wind wave
models is proposed. The scheme is separated into two parts: the energy propagation
numerical realization and the numerical source term integration. The energy
propagation numerical realization is based on the semi-Lagrangian numerical method.
The original correction term is derived to remove the garden-sprinkler effect of the

surface. The method results proved to be much closer to the analytical solution than
the finite difference schemes. The method is absolute stabile. Its higher accuracy is
achieved by using larger propagation time steps (three hours and more). The main feature
of the method is that it may be applicable to solve the energy balance equation with a fine space
grid by using larger time step than it is allowed by the traditional finite-difference schemes.
The second part of the total scheme is based on a spreading numerical method. It uses
the semi-analytical solution for integration source term, which includes the wind
wave input, dissipation term, and exact non-linear energy transfer function. The
method gives reliable and stable results for time steps up to three hours and more. The
