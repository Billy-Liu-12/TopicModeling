Abstract. Computing 3D velocity ﬁelds is an important task in subsurface water ﬂow analysis. While Finite Element (FE) simulations generally yields accurate estimates of the head, the numerical velocity may
display errors and even unphysical behavior in some parts of the domain.
Theoretically, the Mixed Hybrid FE (MHFE) approach provide a more
accurate approximation to the velocities.
In this communication we analyze a number of 3D–ﬂow test cases, and
compare the results obtained using FE and MHFE on tetrahedral meshes.
Theoretical convergence estimates are numerically veriﬁed for a few simple problems. A more complex heterogeneous test case is used to show
that, even for very ﬁne meshes, the results obtained using the two discretization approaches may diﬀer.

Introduction

The Finite Element (FE) and the Mixed Hybrid Finite Element (MHFE) schemes
provide numerical solutions to three-dimensional ﬂow equations. They display
diﬀerent behaviors, both for the potential and the velocity ﬁelds. In this communication we analyze the characteristics of these two numerical approaches,
detailing the emerging diﬀerences and the advantages and disadvantages of one
method over the other.
The equations governing steady–state 3D porous media ﬂow are:
∇ · v = f,
v = −K∇ψ,

(1)

where ψ is the pressure head, v is the Darcy velocity vector, K is the permeability
tensor and f is a source or sink term.
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions must be given to identify a well
posed mathematical formulation of the ﬂow problem. These conditions are
ψ(x) = ψP (x)
v · n = −qN (x)

on Γ1 ,
on Γ2 ,

where x = (x, y, z)T is the Cartesian spatial coordinate vector, ψP is the prescribed pressure head (Dirichlet conditions) on the boundary portion Γ1 , n is
the outward normal unit vector, and qN is the prescribed ﬂux (Neumann condition) across the boundary portion Γ2 . We adopt the convention of considering
the ﬂux, qN , positive when it is inward, negative when outward.

FE and MHFE Solution

Let Tl be a generic tetrahedron of the three-dimensional triangulation discretizing the domain, and let p be the total number of nodes, let m be the total
number of elements, and n the total number of faces (triangles). This computational mesh is deﬁned for both the FE and MHFE schemes.
The FE method considered in this paper is a standard Galerkin approach
that employs linear basis functions for the pressure head at the nodes:
p

ψ≈

ψi Ni (x, y, z),
i=1

where Ni (x, y, z) = ai x+bi y +ci z +di . Velocities are proportional to the gradient
of the pressure, which in this case is constant over each tetrahedron. They can
be deﬁned as:


ai + aj + ak + am
v (l) = −K  bi + bj + bk + bm  ,
ci + cj + ck + cm
where i, j, k, m denote the four nodes that deﬁne tetrahedron Tl . This approach
is the natural method for evaluating velocities in FE schemes and is also the
most accurate when no additional post processing is exploited. It is known that
the Galerkin approach on tetrahedrons may lead to numerical inaccurate and not
mass-conserving ﬂuxes, in particular for heterogeneous conductivity tensors [1,
2,3].
The MHFE formulation that we exploited is an extension to 3D tetrahedral meshes of a 2D algorithm for triangular meshes [4,5]. The pressure ψ, the
Lagrange multipliers λ, and the ﬂux v are approximated by

Here, i, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, j = 1, . . . , n, r = 4(l − 1) + i, and ψ = (ψl ), λ = (λj ), and
bN = (bN j ), where bN j is non–zero only if there is a Neumann condition on a
(l)
boundary face, ej . The vector ni is the outward normal to face i of tetrahedron
Tl .
The ensuing system of equations on the unknown λ is
QT M Qλ = QT SH −1 f − bN ,
where H = B T A−1 B, S = A−1 B, and M = A−1 −SH −1 S T . The system is symmetric, positive deﬁnite, hence it can be eﬃciently solved by the Preconditioned
Conjugate Gradient method. Once λ is computed, ψ and v are easily obtained.
As opposed to the FE approach, the velocity ﬁeld thus calculated is inherently
mass conserving. The number of faces in the 3D mesh is also the size of system
(2). Note that the coeﬃcient matrix counts no more than ﬁve non–zero entries
per row.
In the case of MHFE, the number of unknowns is larger than for the FE
scheme, as the number of faces is approximately 6 times that one of nodes. On
the other hand, the MHFE system matrix is sparser than the corresponding FE
matrix, yielding a relatively more eﬃcient matrix–vector product. However, the
computational cost of the MHFE linear system solution is always higher than
that of FE.

Numerical Results
Example 1

The ﬁrst example considers a cubic domain Ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 1]. The discretization is obtained as follows. The coarsest mesh level ( = 1) is obtained
by subdividing the topmost horizontal face of the cube into 8 × 8 squares, cut
along the diagonal to form a mesh of 128 triangles. This surface mesh is then
replicated vertically (along z) to form 8 layers. Each triangle is thus the base
of a rectangular prism that is subdivided into 3 tetrahedrons by suitably taking
one main diagonal over each one of its vertical faces [8]. The mesh thus obtained
counts 729 nodes, 3072 tetrahedrons, and 6528 faces. The next coarser mesh levels, = 2, 3, are obtained by uniformly reﬁning the previous level surface mesh
(each triangle is subdivided into four triangles by connecting the midpoints of
each edge) and by doubling the previous level layers. The second level ( = 2)
is characterized by 4913 nodes, 24576 tetrahedrons, and 50688 faces, while the
ﬁnest ( = 3) level has 35937 nodes, 196608 tetrahedrons, and 399360 faces. This
procedure guarantees that no tetrahedron face has angles larger than π/2.

We calculate the related forcing function f in (1), and the Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The numerical convergence behavior of our schemes is analyzed by
computing suitable relative errors of the pressure and velocity ﬁelds on each grid
level.
The L2 error norm for pressure head is

(ψ(P j ) − ψj )2 

When applying the MHFE method, the quantity ψ(P j ) is the analytical pressure
at the centroid of the tetrahedron Tj . When applying the FE scheme, ψ(P j ) is
the analytical pressure on the node P j . The value ψj is the numerical approximation to each of these values, obtained by MHFE and FE methods, respectively.
Our measure of the L2 error on the velocity is
1/2 



δ∈{x,y,z}

Here, (vx (P j ), vy (P j ), vz (P j )) is the analytical velocity on the centroid of each
element, while (vx,j , vy,j , vz,j ) is the corresponding numerically approximated
vector.

Table 1 shows the numerical convergence orders, p = log2 (|e ,δ |/|e −1,δ |),
where either δ = ψ, or δ = v. The numerical order well compares with the
theoretical values, which are p = 2 for the head, p = 1 for the velocity, showing
that asymptotic conditions hold for our domain discretizations.
MHFE mass balance errors are under 10−10 (the tolerance for the linear
system solution), while the FE errors range between 10−5 and 10−10 .

condition. The domain is discretized using the same procedure as before. Four
mesh levels = 1, 2, 3, 4 are considered.
No theoretical solution is available for this test problem, and thus we do not
carry out convergence tests. Instead we look at streamlines (Figure 2) calculated
from the velocity ﬁeld. We consider a horizontal line passing through the edge
of the uppermost block (shown in Figure 2 as dash-dotted line) and draw the
streamlines that start from four evenly spaced points on this line. The streamlines
are computed using an adaptive Runge-Kutta method of order 4. Figure 3 shows
the trace of the streamlines projected on the y −z plane (top), and the projection
on the x − z plane (bottom), for the solution at level = 2. Figure 4 shows the
same results for = 4. The thick gray lines correspond to the FE solution, while
the thin lines correspond to the MHFE solution.
It is interesting to note the strong diﬀerences between the FE and MHFE
streamlines, which hold even in the ﬁnest mesh. Note also that the MHFE
streamlines change from level to level less than the corresponding FE streamlines,
showing that MHFE may be more accurate then FE in this respect. However,
both FE and MHFE display large deviations between the = 2 and = 4 cases.
