Abstract. Accurate models for Overcurrent relays (OC) with inverse time
characteristics have an important role for efficient coordination of power
system protection devices. This paper proposes a new method for modelling of OC relays based on fuzzy logic. The new model is more accurate
than traditional models and has been validated by comparing it with the
linear and nonlinear analytical models.

Introduction

Due to unforseen load expansion, many power systems are operated close to their
design limits, therefore it is necessary to revise modelling of relays under these conditions [1]. OC relay models are defined in various ways. Time-Current (TC) curves of
an OC relay is the most commonly used method [2]. There are two main methods for
representing an OC relay i.e., by using digital computers: software models and direct
data storage. Software models of OC relay characteristics play a major role in coordinating protection schemes in power systems [3].
A comprehensive review of computer representation of OC relays has been made
in reference [4]. In this review, it is stated that Sachdev models are simple and useful
polynomials for modelling OC relays for coordination purposes. It should be noted
that any microprocessor relay abiding to the IEEE Std. C37.112 [5], should follow in
this representation the equations provided by their standard. Furthermore in this context, the time dial setting provided by this standard is linear.
An alternative method for the representation of OC relays is based on direct data
storage techniques. These techniques store data in memory of the computers for different TDS/TMS and then select operating points of a relay based on the stored data
for different TDS/TMS. If the selected operating point does not match with one of the
stored values an interpolation is necessary to determine the corresponding time.
Therefore, this method requires storing large amount of data.
In this paper a new model based on fuzzy logic and is more accurate than analytical models and does not need look up tables is presented. The new methodology employed gives a more accurate model, compared with the model introduced in [6].

2 The New Method
The proposed fuzzy model is based on finding a simple mathematical equation with a
fuzzy correction coefficient to calculate the operating time of OC relays.
In Fig. 1, (t1, I1), (t2, I2) and (t3, I3), sampled data are given is the operating time of
OC relay for a given I*. The simplest equation for fitting two points on a curve is the
straight line equation. This mathematical equation does not need any complicated
curve fitting technique. In reality, two adjacent points on OC relay characteristics are
connected as a line. Therefore, the proposed fuzzy logic model finds a fuzzy correction coefficient to simulate the curve of the OC relay under consideration.

If the two points (t1, I1) and (t2, I2) of Fig. 1 are the considered sampled data, then
the operation time associated with I* can be calculated by As follows:

t * line = (t 2 − t1 ).(I * − I 1 ) /( I 2 − I 1 ) + t1

(1)

The calculated operation time according to equation (1) is t*Line which differes
from actual one, i.e. t*. Therefore, a correction factor must be added to equation (1).
The variation of correction factor, r, is determined using fuzzy logic technique. The
equation with correction factor is given as:

t * = r.(t 2 − t1 ).( I * − I 1 ) /( I 2 − I 1 ) + t1

(2)

The fuzzy correction coefficient r varies between 0 and 1 when the location of I*
changes on the current multiplier setting axis of TC curves. The values of I* and the

92

slope (s) of the line between adjacent data, play an important role in calculating the
variation of r. For example, when I* gets large and goes near the tale of the TC curve,
and the slope gets smaller. Subsequently, the curve between two neighbouring data is
close to a direct line. Therefore, the value of r increases and approaches a value close
to one.
Equations (3) and (4) describe the calculation of r and s for the sampled data.

ri = [(I i+2 − I i ).(ti+1 − ti )] /[(ti+2 − ti ).(I i+1 − I i )]

(3)

si = (t i +1 − t i ) /( I i +1 − I i )

(4)

For example, in considering Fig. 1, r1 can be obtained by Eq. (5).

r1 = [(I 3 − I1 ).(t2 − t1 )] /[(I 3 − I1 ).(t2 − t1 )]

(5)

The membership functions of I, r and s of sampled data are necessary for
calculating the value of r for other set of data. It is worth mentioning that the value of I
can be obtained from the catalogues of OC relays. For example, I varies from 2 to 30
for RSA20, an electromechanical OC relay. However, the values of s and r must be
calculated based on the stored data and then used for the calculation of the
membership functions of r (µr) and s (µs). Because the values of I, r and s are
positive, only Positive Small (PS), Positive Medium (PM) and Positive Big (PB) are
effective.
The membership functions of I, r and s are shown in Fig. 2.

It is found by trial and error that the trapezoid shape for PM produces better results
than triangular shape, which is used in reference [6]. This feature is regarded as an
advantage in the new fuzzy model, compared with the previous method,

Determining fuzzy rules are the next step in fuzzy modeling. As can be seen from
Fig. 1, when I is small, near pick-up current, and s is large, because TC curve closes
to its asymptotic, then the value of r must be selected large, i.e., 1. In other words, TC
curves of OC relays near the pick-up currents are very straight like a direct line.
Based on above assumptions, the fuzzy rules for the proposed method are as below:
- If I is small and s is large then r is large.
- If I is small and s is medium then r is medium.
- If I is medium and s is small then r is medium.
- If I is medium and s is medium then r is small.
- If I is medium and s is large then r is medium.
- If I is large and s is medium then r is medium.
- If I is large and s is small then r is large.
The last step in fuzzy modelling is determining the value of r. In this paper, the
centroid method is used to calculate r. Equations (6)–(8) show how to obtain r.

Case Study

Two types of OC relays were used for evaluating the proposed model. The first one
was RSA20, an electromechanical OC relay, where its TDS varies from 4 to 20. The
second one was CRP9, a very inverse electromechanical OC relay. For both relays,
the used sampled data are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively, Additional
sampled data which is shown in Tables 3 and 4 is used for testing and comparing the
analytical and the proposed models.

Fuzzy Model Application
Fuzzy Model of RSA20 OC Relay

The recommended analytical model in reference [4] is selected for comparison between the new and the mathematical model. Due to the progresses in both calculating
methods and software packages an equation with more polynomials coefficients is
possible and provides more accurate results. MATLAB has provided a useful environment to calculate polynomials coefficients based on advanced non-linear curve
fitting techniques [11,12]. Therefore, Eq. (10) with nine coefficients is chosen. It
should be noted that when a polynomial equation with more than nine coefficients
was used, ill-structure matrices and poor output results were reported by MATLAB.
In addition, normalized operation time data were used to improve the accuracy of the
obtained results by

t =a0 +a1 /(I −1) +a2 /(I −1)2 +...+a8 /(I −1)8

(10)
The coefficients of Eq. (10), i.e. a0 to a8, are shown in Table 5 where data in columns TDS=4, 8 and 20 of Table 1 are selected as input. The first column of Table 5
shows the coefficients of Eq. (10) for the sampled data of TC curve when TDS=6.

As can be seen from Fig. 4, the average of error percentages of the fuzzy model
results are smaller than the polynomial form and in most cases is near 0.4 percent. In
addition, Fig. 5 shows that the error percentage of the fuzzy model decreases when
the fault current through the relay increases. This is an important feature, because
high fault currents can cause more damages to the power systems components.

Fuzzy Model of CRP9 OC Relay

In this section, the fuzzy model is applied to CRP9 OC relay to find its characteristic.
The relay is an electromechanical type and its data are given in Table 2. The data are
obtained by experimental tests. The coefficients of the analytical model, i.e. a0 to a8
for the relay, are calculated and shown in Table 6.
Figures 6–7 show the obtained results after applying two different methods.

Figure 6 shows the fuzzy model of CRP9 is more precise than the analytical ninecoefficient model. Similar to RSA20, the average error percentage of proposed model
is below 1.5 percent and usually decreases when current multiplier setting increases.
On the other hand, the fuzzy method uses very simple mathematical equation and
does not involve to complicated curve fitting techniques. Consequently, ill-structure
matrices and poor results are not reported.

Conclusion

In this paper a new model for OC relays, based on fuzzy logic is presented. The new
model was evaluated by experimental tests on two types of OC relays. The results
revealed that the error percentages of fuzzy model for both relays were low. In comparing, the results of the new method with the analytical model, it was evident that the
new model did not need any curve fitting technique. It has been shown that the
method is flexible and can take into account different relay characteristics with linear
and nonlinear features.
