Abstract. Shear deformation of fault gouge or other particulate materials often
results in observed strain localization, or more precisely, the localization of
measured deformation gradients. In conventional elastic materials the strain localization cannot take place therefore this phenomenon is attributed to special
types of non-elastic constitutive behaviour. For particulate materials however
the Cosserat continuum which takes care of microrotations independent of displacements is a more appropriate model. In elastic Cosserat continuum the localization in displacement gradients is possible under some combinations of the
generalized Cosserat elastic moduli. The same combinations of parameters also
correspond to a considerable dispersion in shear wave propagation which can be
used for independent experimental verification of the proposed mechanism of
apparent strain localization in fault gouge.

Introduction

Strain localization under shear loading is often observed in granulate materials such
as the material of fault gouge. If however one models a fault gouge as a homogeneous
elastic layer of thickness 2h, occupying the strip –h<x2<h in a Cartesian coordinate
frame (x1x2x3) with specified displacement at the boundaries u1(x1,±h,x3)=±u10,
u2(x1,±h,x3)= u3(x1,±h,x3)=0, then the shear strain and stress will be uniform i.e.
ε12=u10/2h, σ12=µu10/h, where µ is the shear modulus of the gouge. Thus the strain
localization is perceived as a manifestation of material instability which can only be
achieved under either large deformations or certain inelastic constitutive laws, such as
non-associated plasticity (eg, [1]) or post-peak softening.
An important feature of granulate materials overlooked by the conventional continuum mechanics is the presence of microrotations arising from the ability of particles to rotate independently, i.e. not in a chord with the rotations associated with the
displacement field. This feature can be modelled by Cosserat continuum in which
strain and displacement gradient become different. Observations of localization usuP.M.A. Sloot et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2003, LNCS 2659, pp. 873–882, 2003.

ally refer to the measurements of displacement gradients. In the present paper we
show that in a Cosserat continuum localization of the displacement gradient can be
observed even for elastic gouge. We show that the combinations of parameters producing the localization also lead to dispersion in shear wave propagation.

Three-Dimensional Continuum Elastic Model of Granulate
Materials

Cosserat continuum models of a particulate material can be obtained by homogenisation of discrete equations of motion of the particles. Mühlhaus and Oka [2] suggested
a continuum model for assemblies of identical spheres without resistance to relative
rotations. The equations of motion were homogenised by expanding the difference
expressions of the discrete model into Taylor series and retaining terms up to the second order. Since rotational degrees of freedom were introduced and higher order
terms kept in the corresponding Taylor expansions, the resulted continuum description was a combination of a Cosserat theory and a strain gradient theory. An analysis
of simple 1D particle arrangements ([3, 4]) showed that the resistance to relative rotations at particle contacts is important: its neglect leads to the loss of positive definiteness of the energy [2]. In the following we consider the resistance of the spheres to
relative rotations at the contact points (see also [5]). The non-symmetry of the stress
can then be balanced by moment stresses caused by relative rotations at the contacts
alone.
We consider a three-dimensional assembly of identical spherical grains. The diameter D of the grain is assumed as much smaller than the problem dimension L, so
that D<<L. The spheres are in permanent contact; and the orientation of the contact
points is assumed as random. In our idealised model, every point of the equivalent
continuum corresponds to the centroid of the reference sphere in the discrete material.
Interaction between each pair of neighbouring particles is represented by the total
contact force F and contact moment M . The contact moment reflects the fact that
the real particles are neither absolutely rigid nor perfectly spherical and hence contact
over a certain area. Then the relative rotation of one particle with respect to the other
results in a non-symmetric distribution of contact forces, which in the first approximation can be described by the contact moment. It is supposed that the contact force and
the moment are linearly dependent upon the relative displacement ∆u and rotation
∆ϕ between the neighbouring particles respectively:

F = K∆u , M = L∆ϕ ,

Simple Shear of Elastic Gouge with Microrotations

We consider a model of fault gouge as an infinite Cosserat elastic layer occupying the
area |x1|< ∞ , |x2|<h under plain strain conditions (Fig. 1) subjected to the following
boundary conditions:

876

E. Pasternak, H.-B. Mühlhaus, and A.V. Dyskin

u1(x1,±h,x3)=±u10, u2(x1,±h,x3)=0, ϕ3(x1,±h,x3)=0.

(8)

The Cosserat continuum Lamé equations for the plain strain with no body forces
and moments can be obtained by substituting (4), (5) into (3):
(2µ+λ) 2u1/ x12+λ 2u2/ x1 x2+(µ+α) 2u1/ x22+(µ-α) 2u2/ x1 x2+2α ϕ3/ x2=0,
(9)
(µ+α) 2u2/ x12+(µ-α) 2u1/ x1 x2+(2µ+λ) 2u2/ x22+λ 2u1/ x1 x2-2α ϕ3/ x1=0,
(10)
B( 2ϕ3/ x12+ 2ϕ3/ x22)+2α( u2/ x1- u1/ x2-2ϕ3)=0,

(11)

where λ and µ are Lamé coefficients, α and B are the Cosserat elastic moduli, the
latter is bending stiffness. The Lamé coefficients λ, µ and the Cosserat parameters α
and B can be expressed through the micromechanical Cosserat model parameters,
namely the solid volume fraction νs, coordination number k, the sphere diameter D
and respective contact stiffnesses kn, ks, kϕn, kϕs introduced in the previous section.
This can be achieved by comparing micromechanical Cosserat elastic moduli (6), (7)
in the constitutive equations (4) with corresponding terms in continuum Cosserat theory taken, for example from [6] that reads
σ11=(2µ+λ)γ11+λγ22, σ12=(µ+α)γ12+(µ-α)γ21, σ21=(µ+α)γ21+(µ-α)γ12,
σ22=λγ11+(2µ+λ)γ22,

By doing so one obtains
λ=νsk(kn-ks)/(5πD), µ=νsk(2kn+3ks)/(10πD), α=νskks/(2πD),
B=νsk(kϕn+4kϕs)/(5πD).

(14)

Noting that the boundary conditions (8) are homogeneous along x1, we are seeking
a homogeneous along x1 solution of the system of the Lamé equations (9-11) satisfying these boundary conditions. If we find such a solution according to the uniqueness
theorem this solution will be unique.
Such a solution can be written in the normalized form (h=1, u10=1) as follows:



sinh( x 2 / l ) 2
Λ l tanh(1 / l ) (1 − Λ2 l tanh(1 / l )) −1 , u2=0,
u1 =  x2 −

(1 − Λ2 l tanh(1 / l )) −1 ,
ϕ3 = − 1 −
2
cosh(1 / l ) 

(16)

where
Λ=l1/l, l=(l12+l22)1/2, l1=(B/4µ)1/2, l2=(B/4α)1/2.

(17)

Parameters l1 and l2 are two independent length scale parameters (normalized by h)
reflecting the presence of a microstructure in the Cosserat continuum, with l acting as
a “hypotenuse” of the Cosserat continuum length scale parameters. Their expressions
through the microstructural parameters by using (14) can be written as follows:

l1 =

( k ϕ n + 4 k ϕ s ) ( k n + k s ) l2 =

l=

⋅

k n + 4k s
2k n + 3k s

(18)

.

Consequently, after further normalisation (µ=1) of stress and moment stress fields
one obtains:


cosh( x2 / l ) 
(1 − Λ2 l tanh(1 / l )) −1 ,
σ12 = 1 − 2Λ2
cosh(1 / l ) 

σ 21 = (1 − Λ2 l tanh(1 / l )) −1 ,

Figures 2–4 show the distributions of displacement and displacement gradient for
various ratios of microstructural parameters Λ, l. The displacements (Fig. 2) lie between the one for the standard elastic solution (Λ=0, l=0), and the Cosserat solution
(Λ=1, l=1) that exhibits maximum deviation from the standard continuum solution.
The displacement gradient for relatively small values of the parameter l (Fig. 3) exhibits a kind of plateau, which is insensitive to the values of the dimensionless parameter 0<Λ<1. There is however a range of parameters Λ and l, for which the displacement gradient is highly non-homogeneous and displays localisation reaching its
peak for the combination of parameters Λ=1, l=1 (Fig. 4). Indeed, as the displacement
gradient u1,2 reaches its maximum at x2=0 for any values of Λ, l, the parametric analysis of the solution performed for the middle layer of the gouge

Figures 5 and 6 show the distributions of normalized moment stress µ23 and antisymmetric σ[21] and symmetric σ(21) parts of the shear stress. It is seen that the maximum values of the moment stress and the antisymmetric shear stress are attained at
the gouge boundaries, while the maximum (localization) of the symmetric stress is
achieved at the middle layer of the gouge the latter being in accordance with the localization of the displacement gradient.

On the Possibility of Determining the Localization Regime
from Wave Velocity Measurements

Prior determination of whether the fault gouge can show localization requires the
measurements of calculations of the Cosserat parameters, which is somewhat involved. It would be attractive to use the measurements of velocities of wave propagation through the gouge material for this purpose.
Consider propagation of planar waves in an infinite Cosserat material. According
to [6] there are the following types of planar waves: (1) a conventional longitudinal
wave, which is insensitive to the microrotations; (2) a twist wave which reflects the
Cosserat properties of the material, but difficult to measure and; (3) one or two (depending upon frequency) shear waves. These shear waves show dispersion which is a
result of the Cosserat properties and could therefore be used for identifying possible
localization. The wave number ξ for these shear waves satisfies the following characteristic equation (eg, [6])

where ρ is the material density, J is the rotational inertia which in the case of material

When ω<<ω∗ equation (22) gives only one solution which corresponds to the shear
wave propagating with the velocity ω/ξ≅c5 which is the conventional shear wave velocity. When ω=ω∗ equation (22) again gives only one solution corresponding to a
shear wave traveling with velocity c∗, where

If one assumes that the total characteristic length l is at least not smaller than the
particle diameter D, then the localization case, Λ 1 corresponds to the case of
c∗/c5>>1. Thus the localization case should correspond to considerable dispersion in
the shear wave: its velocity should markedly increase with the increase in frequency.
It should be noted that the waves at frequencies close to ω∗ may considerably be attenuated by scattering since the length of the shear wave of frequency ω∗ is

Conclusion

The presence of independent microrotations in particulate materials (e.g. the gouge)
can lead to considerable localization of deformation gradients which when measured
and interpreted in a sense of conventional medium create an impression of strain localization and associated material instability. Such a phenomenon, if experimentally
confirmed will give a strong evidence of importance of the microrotational and
Cosserat effects. The same phenomenon also leads to a considerable dispersion in
shear wave propagation which can be used for independent experimental verification
of the proposed mechanism of apparent strain localization in fault gouge.
