Abstract. In the general discussion of double auction, three properties
are mainly considered: incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic eﬃciency. In this paper, we introduce another property of double
auction: semi-independence, from which we are trying to reveal the essential relation between incentive compatibility and economic eﬃciency.
· Babaioﬀ and Nisan [1] studied supply chain of markets and corresponding protocols that solve the transaction and price issues in markets
chain. In the second part of the paper, we extend their model to two-level
markets, in which all markets in the supply chain are independent and
controlled by diﬀerent owners. Beyond this basic markets chain, there is
a communication network (among all owners and another global manager) that instructs the transaction and price issues of the basic markets.
Then we discuss incentive compatible problems of owners in the middle
level of the markets in terms of semi-independence.

Introduction

With the rapid progresses of e-commerce over the Internet, a number of economic
concepts have been integrated with computer science extensively, such as Game
Theory [9,10], Mechanism Design [7,8] and Auction Theory [6]. One of the most
remarkable combinations is that of electronic market, which is on the basis of
double auctions.
Double auction, a classic economic concept, speciﬁes that multiple sellers
and buyers submit bids to ask for transactions for some well-deﬁned goods [4].
For diﬀerent purposes, the designed protocols should satisfy required properties
over the Internet. Three properties are mainly concerned: incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic eﬃciency. The ﬁrst one emphasize the truthful
behavior of agents (sellers and buyers), whereas the last two are macro requirements to the outcome. It’s well known that the three properties can not be
hold simultaneously under mild assumptions [7]. Hence we are trying to seek
for the more essential relations among these properties. Speciﬁcally, we present

another property, semi-independence, from which we study the relation between
incentive compatibility and economic eﬃciency deeply.
Note that such electronic market, on which the double auction applies, can
not reﬂect the information of related commodities exactly. Hence Babaioﬀ and
Nisan introduced the model of supply chain of markets [1] to solve this problem. For example, in lemonade-stand industry, a lemon market sells lemons, a
squeezing market oﬀers squeezing services, and lemonade are provided by a juice
market. These three markets are composed of the supply chain of lemonade. In
addition, Babaioﬀ and Nisan introduced symmetric (pivot) protocol for exchanging information along markets. These protocols determine the supply/demand
curve for each market, and allow each market to function independently.
However, markets of diﬀerent goods in that model are controlled by a single
person. Sometimes, a supply chain of markets may be very diﬃcult to construct
and manage for a single one. Hence we propose to study a model that allows
the individual market to be fully independent. Speciﬁcally, we consider two-level
markets, where each market in the original supply chain is controlled by a different owner. Moreover, there is another higher level market among owners. The
transaction and price issues of the basic markets chain are determined through
the interaction of owners at the upper level market.
Many appealing problems arise in such two-level markets model. For example, as participants of the markets, all owners may have their own targets and
utilities. Thus we need consider the truthful behaviors of owners, i.e., incentive
compatibility. Observing that as a link between two-level markets, such behaviors include two directions: to agents and to manager. That is, the owner may
lie to each of them or both. Therefore in this paper, we study the relation between the mechanisms of the markets chain and the truthful behavior of owners.
Speciﬁcally, we show several suﬃcient and necessary conditions that guarantee
incentive compatibility for diﬀerent types of owners.
Note that the study of truthful behavior of owners is more closer to practical
(electronic) markets, since intermediaries (owners) play an important role in the
transactions of the markets and the performance of the whole markets is mostly
determined by behaviors of these owners. As we have seen in reality, the loss
of eﬃciency and budget deﬁcit are mainly due to the selﬁsh behaviors of such
owners. Therefore we believe that this paper is an important step in the quest
for the mechanisms that promote economic eﬃciency and market revenue.
In section 2, we review the basic concepts of double auction and introduce
the property of semi-independence. Next, we brieﬂy review the supply chain
markets model of [1] and introduce the model of two-level markets. In section 4,
we study the issue of incentive compatibility of owners in two-level markets.

2.1

Double Auction
The Model

In a market of a kind of goods, there are n sellers and buyers, respectively. Each
seller has one indivisible goods to sell and each buyer plans to buy at most

36

one item. Each agent (seller or buyer) has a privately known non-negative real,
termed as type, representing the true valuation that the seller/buyer wants to
charge/pay.
To win the auction, each agent submits a value to the auctioneer. Let si
be the i-th supply bid (in the non-decreasing order) of sellers and dj the j-th
demand bid (in the non-increasing order) of buyers, i.e., 0 ≤ s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ sn
and d1 ≥ d2 ≥ · · · ≥ dn ≥ 0. We denote S = (s1 , . . . , sn ) as the supply curve
and D = (d1 , . . . , dn ) as the demand curve of market. The utility for trading
agent (i.e., winner ) is the absolute value of the diﬀerence between price and his
true type. For non-trading agent, the utility is zero. We assume that all agents
are self-interested, that is, they aim to maximize their own utilities. Note that
to maximize the utilities, agents may not submit their types, the strategy is
determined according to diﬀerent double auction rules.
Double auction (DA) rule R is a mechanism that, upon receiving input: supply and demand curves S and D, speciﬁes the quantity q = Rq (S, D) of transactions to be conducted and the price ps = Rs (S, D), pd = Rd (S, D) that the
trading sellers/buyers receive/pay. Note that in all DA discussed in this paper,
non-trading agents receive/pay zero, and once the trade quantity q is ﬁxed, the
winners are the ﬁrst q sellers (with lowest supply bids) and buyers (with highest
demand bids), respectively. Moreover, we only concern non-discriminating DA,
i.e., the price paid by all buyers is same and the price paid to all sellers is same
too, but the two values are not necessarily equal.
Let l, optimal trade quantity, be the maximal index such that sl ≤ dl . Assume without loss of generality that there always exist the (l + 1)-th supply and
demand bid, sl+1 and dl+1 , such that sl+1 > dl+1 . Otherwise, we may add sellers with bids ∞ and buyers with bids zero1 . Followings are some classic DA rules:
– k-DA: ([12,2]) q = l, and ps = pd = k · sl + (1 − k) · dl , where k ∈ [0, 1].
– VCG DA: ([11,3,5]) q = l, and ps = min{sl+1 , dl }, pd = max{sl , dl+1 }.
– Trade Reduction (TR) DA: ([1]) q = l − 1, and ps = sl , pd = dl .
2.2

Semi-independence of Double Auction

We denote (a1 , . . . , ai−1 , ai+1 , . . . , an ) as a−i and (a−i , ai ) as the tuple
(a1 , . . . , an ). In this paper, we mainly consider the following properties of DA:
(i) incentive compatibility: The DA motivates self-interested agents to submit
their types to maximize the utility values. It’s easy to see that for any incentive
compatible DA, there must be ps ≥ sq and pd ≤ dq , where q units of goods
traded. (ii) budget balance: The total payment of buyers should be at least the
total amount given to sellers, i.e., the revenue of the mechanism is non-negative.
(iii) economic eﬃciency: The desired outcome should maximize the total types
of all agents. That is, all sellers with types below the market clearing price should
trade with all buyers whose types are above the clearing price [1].
1

Note that for any eﬃcient DA, the optimal trade quantity l may not be identical under diﬀerent
supply and demand curves.

Double Auction in Two-Level Markets

37

Note that trading l units of goods maximizes eﬃciency if all agents submit
their true types. We denote such DA that trading l units of goods as eﬃcient
DA. Following let’s ﬁrst look at another property of DA, semi-independence.
Deﬁnition 1 (Semi-Independence): Given eﬃcient DA R, supply and
demand curves S and D, let ps = Rs (S, D), pd = Rd (S, D), and l = Rq (S, D)
be optimal trade quantity. We say price ps is semi-independent of si under S
and D, if
– 1 ≤ i ≤ l, Rs ((s−i , si ), D) = ps , for ∀ si ∈ [si−1 , si ] (if i=1, s1 ∈ [0, s1 ]).
– l < i ≤ n, Rs ((s−i , si ), D) = ps , for ∀ si ∈ [si , si+1 ] (if i = n, sn ∈ [sn , ∞)).
That is, when si changes to its neighbor bid continuously, the price ps will
not change. To sellers, the price is semi-independent of i-th supply bid if for ∀
S and D, price Rs (S, D) is semi-independent of the i-th supply bid si under S
and D. If the price is semi-independent of all supply bids under any supply and
demand curves, we say DA R is semi-independent of supply curve. Similarly, we
can deﬁne R is semi-independent of demand curve.
Following lemma reveals the essential connections between incentive compatibility and economic eﬃciency on the basis of semi-independence.
Lemma 1 For any eﬃcient and incentive compatible DA R, let l be the optimal trade quantity, then the price to sellers/buyers is semi-independent of i-th
supply/demand bid, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l. And if the (l + 1)-th supply/demand bid is
strictly smaller/larger than the (l + 2)-th bid, the price is not semi-independent
of the (l + 1)-th bid.
Proof. We only prove the case to sellers and supply bids, the other one is similar.
We ﬁrst prove the ﬁrst part, that is, the price to sellers is semi-independent of
i-th supply bid, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l.
For any supply and demand curves S = (s1 , . . . , sn ) and D, let ps =
Rs (S, D). Then we need to show that ps is semi-independent of s1 , . . . , sl . Suppose otherwise, that there exists i, 1 ≤ i ≤ l, such that modifying si to si
will change ps to ps , where si satisﬁes Deﬁnition 2.1. If ps < ps , the seller who
bids si can increase his utility simply by submitting si untruthfully. If ps > ps ,
let (s1 , . . . , si−1 , si , si+1 , . . . , sn ) be true types of all sellers respectively. Then
same as above, the seller who bids si can increase his utility by reporting si . A
contradiction to incentive compatibility.
It remains to prove that the price to sellers is not semi-independent of the
(l + 1)-th supply bid sl+1 if sl+1 < sl+2 . The idea is to construct a pair of supply
and demand curves S = (s1 , . . . , sn ) and D = (d1 , . . . , dn ), s.t. dl+1 < sl <
sl+1 < dl , to show that the price ps = Rs (S, D) is not semi-independent of sl+1 .
It’s easy to see that such pair of curves does exist.
Claim 1. Price ps = Rs (S , D) = Rs (S, D), where S
(s1 , . . . , sl−1 , sl+1 ,
sl+1 , sl+2 , . . . , sn ), i.e., ps = ps .

= (s−l , sl+1 ) =

Proof of the Claim. Note that the l-th supply bid equals the (l + 1)-th supply
bid in S , since dl+1 < sl+1 < dl , the number of trading goods under S and D
is also l according to the eﬃciency of R, i.e., Rq (S , D) = l. Thus from above
discussion, price ps is semi-independent of the l-th supply bid sl+1 . Hence, when
reducing sl+1 to sl (note that sl ∈ [sl−1 , sl+1 ]), the price does not change, i.e.,
ps = p s .
Our following discussions are based on S and D. Note that Rq (S , D) = l,
and the l-th supply bid is sl+1 in S , thus there must be ps ≥ sl+1 . Next we
consider two cases.
Case 1. ps > sl+1 . In this case, let sl+1 be the true type of the (l + 1)-th seller
who bids sl+1 . Then if he submits the bid truthfully, he won’t get any utility.
But if he submits an suﬃciently small value ε ≥ 0, the supply curve will be
S = (ε, s1 , . . . , sl−1 , sl+1 , sl+2 , . . . ,
sn ) (assuming the submitted bids of other sellers don’t change). According to
R, he will be a trading seller since the number of trading goods is still l (sl−1 ≤
sl < dl and sl+1 > dl+1 ). Following we consider the price ps = Rs (S, D). Because
ps is semi-independent of all the ﬁrst l supply bids, (ε, s1 , . . . , sl−1 ), then the
following supply curves sequence share the same price:
S

= (s1 , s2 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) →
(ε, s2 , s3 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) →
(ε, s1 , s3 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) → · · · →
(ε, s1 , s2 , . . . , sl−1 , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) = S.

That is, we have Rs (S, D) = Rs (S, D), i.e., ps = ps = ps . Hence the seller who
bids ε untruthfully will get utility ps − sl+1 = ps − sl+1 > 0, a contradiction.
Case 2. ps = sl+1 . It’s easy to see there exists δ > 0 such that dl+1 < sl+1 +δ < dl
and sl+1 + δ < sl+2 . Thus when the (l + 1)-th supply bid changes from sl+1 to
sl+1 + δ, if price ps is changed, then the lemma follows. Otherwise, we have
Rs ((s1 , . . . , sl−1 , sl+1 , sl+1 + δ, sl+2 , . . . , sn ), D) = ps .
Similar as claim 1, we can ensure the same price ps even increasing the l-th
supply bid from sl+1 to sl+1 + δ. That is,
Rs ((s1 , . . . , sl−1 , sl+1 + δ, sl+1 + δ, sl+2 , . . . , sn ), D) = ps .
Let sl+1 + δ be the true type of the l-th seller who bids sl+1 + δ. Then although
he is a trading seller, but the utility of him is negative, i.e., ps − (sl+1 + δ) < 0,
which contradicts the property of incentive compatibility.
Therefore, we have constructed speciﬁed supply and demand curves such that
the price is not semi-independent of the (l + 1)-th supply bid, hence the lemma
follows.
Note that if sl+1 = sl+2 , the lemma also works for the ﬁrst index i, where
l + 1 < i < n and sl+1 = · · · = si < si+1 , such that the price to sellers is semiindependent of si . If sl+1 = · · · = sn , then the price to sellers is semi-independent
of sn .

Supply Chain of Markets

Supply chain of markets is a sequence of markets, where the ﬁrst one M 0 provides resources, the last one M t consumes the ﬁnal desired goods and all middle
markets M 1 , . . . , M t−1 convert the previous goods to the following one sequentially. Without loss of generality, assume the number of agent in each market is
equal to n.
3.1

Symmetric Protocol

Note that only the agents (buyers) in the last consume market submit demand
bids, whereas other agents (sellers) in other markets submit supply bids. For any
market M i , denote S i = (si1 , . . . , sin ) as the supply curve and Di = (di1 , . . . , din )
the demand curve of M i , where 0 ≤ si1 ≤ . . . ≤ sin and di1 ≥ . . . ≥ din ≥ 0. Here
S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S t−1 , Dt are composed of the submitted bids of agents of each market
respectively, other curves are computed in terms of the following symmetric
protocol by Babaioﬀ and Nisan [1].
Symmetric Protocol:
Input: Supply/demand curves S 0 , S 1 , . . . , S t−1 , Dt .
Algorithm:
t−1
(1) stj = i=0 sij , for 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
t
(2) ej = dj − stj .
(3) dij = sij + ej , for 0 ≤ i ≤ t − 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
Output: Demand/supply curves D0 , D1 , . . . , Dt−1 , S t .
We stress here that above deﬁnition is just in terms of its mathematical
sense, the original one (exchanging information along the sequence of markets)
is referred to [1]. One of the most attractive properties of symmetric protocol is
the following lemma.
Lemma 2 The supply curve S i of market M i is independent of its demand
curve Di under symmetric protocol, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ t.
Proof. We only prove the lemma for supply market M 0 , others are similar. Let
E = (e1 , . . . , en ), According to symmetric protocol, the demand curve of M 0 is:
D0 = S 0 + E = S 0 + (Dt −

t−1
i=0

S i ) = Dt −

which implies that S 0 is independent of D0 .
3.2

Two-Level Markets

Babaioﬀ and Nisan [1] studied the supply chain of markets based on that the
auctioneer, who creates the markets chain, conducts all aﬀairs among them.
Sometimes, however, it may be very diﬃcult to deal with such a huge markets
network for a single one.

40

N. Chen, X. Deng, and H. Zhu

Therefore, we consider the following two-level markets model, in which all
basic markets in original supply chain are independent and controlled by diﬀerent
owners, rather than a single one. We denote the owner of market M i as Oi .
Among all owners and another (global) manager, the previous auctioneer, there
is a communication network (market) that instruct the transaction and price
issues of all basic markets. That is, all owners submit supply/demand curves
to the manager, who speciﬁes aﬀairs of basic markets in terms of the global
mechanism. Formally,
Deﬁnition 2 (Global Mechanism) A global mechanism G of manager, upon
receiving supply/demand curves of markets owners, specify the following two
issues:
1. Computing demand/supply curve for each market in terms of symmetric
protocol.
2. Deciding the number of transactions to be conducted and the price that the
sellers/buyers should receive/pay among all markets.
In this paper we only consider the case that take DA (with symmetric protocol) as global mechanism, i.e., global DA mechanism. That is, the number
of transactions and price in all markets are determined independently by (the
unique) DA. Hence, all discussed properties of DA also apply in the global case.
Example 1 (Lemonade stand industry [1]) Assume there are three communicating electronic markets that produce lemonade: a lemon market M 0 , sells
lemons; a squeezing market M 1 , oﬀers squeezing services; a juice market M 2 ,
from which buyers buy lemonade. There’re three agents in each market with
valuations showed in the left columns of each market in Graph 1. Then all
participants work as follows:
1. Each agent submits his supply/demand bid to the corresponding owner.
(Assume all agents know the protocol of global mechanism G at ﬁrst).
2. Each owner submits the received bids (curve) to the manager.
3. The manager performs the global mechanism G, and returns the results to
owners.
4. Each owner returns the above results to agents in his market.
5. Each market acts independently in terms of mechanism G and corresponding
curves, then agents get their awards from the owner. For example, if we use
global VCG DA, two juices are sold in juice market at price 8 = max{8, 7}
each.

Graph 1: Operation of Lemonade Stand Industry

Note all agents participate step 1, 4, 5, whereas the manager participates step
2, 3. That is, agents and manager do not communicate directly. For simplicity,
following we denote M as the supply market M 0 and omit the index 0 of all bids
and curves of M .

4

Selﬁsh Owners

Observing that besides performing the protocol of two-level markets, each owner
may has his own goal and to optimize it, he may not execute the protocol
correctly. Thus we need take their reactions into consideration. In this paper, we
assume the utility of each owner is the currency he obtained from the market.
Hence in this case, the function of the selﬁsh owner is, on one hand, controlling
the market, on the other hand, maximizing his utility. Following we only consider
owner O of supply market M . Other owners of the conversion markets and
demand market are similar.
Example 2 (Selﬁsh owner O of lemon market under global VCG DA) Consider
owner O of lemon market showed in above section, the supply bids that he
received are (3, 6, 7). If O submits the supply curve truthfully, the manager will
return corresponding demand curve (19, 9, 1) to him. According to VCG DA,
the ﬁrst two sellers are traded at price 7 each, and O will pay them 14, which
is obtained from the manager. Then we regard that O does not get any utility.
However, if O submits (3, 6, 8) untruthfully, the manager will handout 16 to him
but at the inner lemon market, O only needs to pay 14 to the two trading sellers.
Thus O gets 2 dollars successfully from his lying. (Note that agents do not know
what the supply curve that O submits to the manager).
Remark 1. In fact, the trick of O is that the manager only knows the submitted
bid 8, whereas agents only know the true bid 7. Similarly, O may get utility by
lying to agents. Moreover, this phenomenon also arises in global k-DA and TR
DA.
Remark 2. For non-incentive compatible DA, the submitted bids of agents may
not be their true types. But here, we only consider the conduct of owners, i.e.,
whether he can get positive utility from his lying.

42

N. Chen, X. Deng, and H. Zhu

Remark 3. Note that when O submits the supply curve untruthfully, the number
of transactions may be diﬀerent from that when he submits the curve truthfully.
Thus, to avoid from being detected by the manager and agents, all owners should
be restricted to quantity consistent (QC): if the number of transactions is q when
all owners truthfully submit their received curves, the quantity should also be q
even if any owner lies.
Therefore it’s reasonable to consider the following property of global mechanism (here, to distinguish the deﬁnition of incentive compatibility of agents, we
use the term immaculate to describe the truthful behavior of owners):
Deﬁnition 3 (Immaculate) In two-level markets, a global mechanism is said
to be immaculate if for any market owner Oi , 0 ≤ i ≤ t, and supply/demand
curves submitted/returned by other owners, Oi won’t get any positive utility
under the restriction of QC, no matter what the supply/demand curve he submits/returns.
4.1

Both-Side Untruthful

In Example 2, O may get positive utility simply by deceiving all agents in M
that the demand curve was (19, 6, 1) instead of the true one (19, 9, 1). Thus O
(who obtains 14 from the manager) gets 2 dollars (he only pays 12 to the ﬁrst two
sellers). That is, owners may lie to both the manager and agents in his market,
i.e., both-side untruthful.
Deﬁnition 4 (Pseudo-Constant DA Families) DA rule R belongs to
pseudo-constant DA families if trading quantity is the unique variable of price
function to trading sellers. That is, for any supply and demand bids, there exists
a function f , s.t. the price to all trading sellers is f (q), where q is the trading
quantity according to R.
It’s easy to see that for any global DA mechanism that is contained in pseudoconstant DA families, the owner won’t get any utility under QC constraint.
Theorem 1 Any global DA mechanism R that does not belong to pseudoconstant DA families is not immaculate when the owner is both-side untruthful.
Proof. Because R is not contained in pseudo-constant DA families, there exist two
pairs of supply/demand curves (S, D) and (S , D ), such that q = Rq (S, D) =
Rq (S , D ), and Rs (S, D) = Rs (S , D ). Let ps = Rs (S, D) and ps = Rs (S , D ).
Assume without loss of generality that ps < ps . Thus we can regard S as
the true bids of sellers, whereas owner O submits S to the manager. Assume
the demand curve of market M is D according to other markets’ curves. Note
that under symmetric protocol, there always exist the submitted curves of other
markets owners such that the demand curve of M is D (Lemma 2). Hence in
terms of S and D , the manager decides q units of goods to be trade and the
price to trading sellers is ps . When getting all payments, q · ps , O returns D
to all agents in M . In such situation, O only needs to pay trading sellers ps
rather other the true price ps (since ps = Rs (S, D)). Therefore, O defalcates
q · (ps − ps ) > 0 from his lying.

One-Side Untruthful – To Manager

Although pseudo-constant DA families avoid corruptions of owners, such mechanisms perform infeasibly because they can not reﬂect the supply curves eﬃciently.
That is, the price may deviate from the values of bids arbitrarily, since it only
depends on the number of transactions. Therefore in this section, we restrict the
power of owners that assume they are always truthful to agents in their own
markets (we denote such owners as type 1). That is, the demand/supply curve
that the owner returns to agents is always the truth. Hence, the utilities of owners are only from the manager, and all trading agents indeed get their original
payment.
Lemma 3 If all owners are type 1 and eﬃcient global DA mechanism R is not
semi-independent of supply curve, then R is not immaculate.
Proof. Trivially, there exist supply/demand curves S and D and i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
such that ps is not semi-independent of si , where ps = Rs (S, D). Note that
Lemma 2 implies that the demand curve D is independent of S = (s−i , si ). Let
l be optimal trade quantity.
Since ps is not semi-independent of si , there exists S = (s−i , si ) such that
ps = ps , where ps = Rs (S , D), and si satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1. Following we consider two possible cases. If ps < ps , let S be submitted bids of agents, then O
can get l · (ps − ps ) utilities by submitting S untruthfully to the manager (note
that untruthfulness of the owner is restricted to QC constraint). If ps < ps , let
S be submitted bids of agents. Similar as above, O can get l · (ps − ps ) utilities
by submitting S to the manager.
Thus O may always get positive utility as long as he does not truthfully
submit supply curve. Therefore the global DA mechanism R is not immaculate.
Whereas if ps is semi-independent of all supply bids, intuitively, no matter
what the supply curve that O submits, he won’t get any utility from the manager.
Formally,
Lemma 4 If all owners are type 1 and eﬃcient global DA mechanism R is
semi-independent of supply curve, then R is immaculate.
Proof. Assume submitted bids of agents in M are s1 , . . . , sn and s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤
sn . Let D = (d1 , . . . , dn ) be demand curve of market M , which is computed in
terms of symmetric protocol. Let ps = R(S, D). To prove R is immaculate, we
only need to show that for any supply curve S = (s1 , . . . , sn ) that O submits,
ps = ps , where ps = Rs (S , D). Note that QC constraint implies that sl ≤ dl and
sl+1 > dl+1 . Let S = (s1 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) and ps = Rs (S, D). We observe
the following two facts.
Claim 1. ps = ps .
Proof of the Claim. We use mathematical induction on the number k that the
last n − k elements of S and S are all identical, i.e.,
(sk+1 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) = (sk+1 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ),

44

N. Chen, X. Deng, and H. Zhu

where 0 ≤ k ≤ l. The cases of k = 0, 1 are trivial. Suppose the claim is correct
when k ≤ j − 1, 2 ≤ j < l. Then if k = j, we have
(sj+1 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) = (sj+1 , . . . , sl , sl+1 , . . . , sn ) & sj = sj .
Assume without loss of generality that sj < sj (the other part is similar as
above). We consider two cases about the relations between sj and (s1 , . . . , sj )
as follows.
Case 1. There exists i, 1 ≤ i ≤ j −1, such that si ≤ sj < si+1 . Then the following
supply curves sequence share the same price:
S

=

(s1 , . . . , si , si+1 , . . . , sj , sj+1 , . . . , sn ) →
(s1 , . . . , si , sj , si+2 , . . . , sj , sj+1 , . . . , sn ) →

(s1 , . . . , si , sj , sj , si+3 , . . . , sj , sj+1 , . . . , sn ) → · · · →
(s1 , . . . , si , sj , . . . , sj , sj+1 , . . . sn ) →
(s1 , . . . , si , si+1 , . . . , sj , sj+1 , . . . , sn ) = S.
Note that the last step is by induction hypothesis and others are by semiindependence.
Case 2. sj < s1 ≤ · · · ≤ sj . Similar as above case, supply curve S and S share
the same price. Therefore, by induction, we have ps = ps .
Claim 2. ps = ps .
Proof of the Claim. (sketch) Similar as the proof of Claim 1, but here the induction is on the number k that the ﬁrst n − k elements of S and S are identical,
where 0 ≤ k ≤ n − l. We omit details here.
Therefore the payment ps , ps and ps , on submitted supply curves S , S and
S respectively, are all identical, i.e., ps = ps = ps . Thus the lemma follows.
Theorem 2 When all owners are type 1, eﬃcient global DA mechanism R is
immaculate if and only if it’s semi-independent of supply curve.

One-Side Untruthful – To Agents

Contrary to above subsection, we may assume all owners are always truthful to
manager (e.g., they may be appointed by the manager) and they can return deliberately constructed demand/supply curves to agents to get utility (we denote
such owners as type 2). Note that the utilities of owners in this case are from
their lying to agents. Similarly, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3 When all owners are type 2, eﬃcient global DA mechanism R is
immaculate if and only if it’s semi-independent of demand curve.
From above discussion and Lemma 1, we have the following corollary.

Double Auction in Two-Level Markets

Corollary 1 If global DA mechanism R is eﬃcient and incentive compatible,
then it’s not immaculate, regardless the types of agents.
Thus global VCG mechanism is not immaculate. Note that although global
k-DA and TR mechanisms do not satisfy the conditions of above corollary (efﬁciency and incentive compatibility), they are not immaculate mechanisms too.
But as to global TR mechanism, we can modify it to immaculate one simply by
exchanging the price functions to trading sellers and buyers.

Conclusion and Further Research

A more general model in practice, two-level markets, is studied in this paper.
Note that our discussions are based on symmetric protocol, but all results also
apply to other protocols that share Lemma 2.
In addition, we study incentive compatible problem for selﬁsh owners who
aim to maximize their own utilities. Contrary to this direction, we may consider
another one that the goal of each owner is to optimize some common values,
such as the total utility of trading agents and income/outcome of the agents in
his market. Actually, this work (on selﬂess owners) is under investment right
now.
As we have seen in this paper and many other works, the implementation of
incentive compatibility is on the cost of decreasing the revenue of the markets.
Thus, whether there exists a weaker feasible notion of incentive compatibility
(such as approximation or average case) is a very meaningful direction in the
future work.
