Abstract. We apply the generalized Jordan sets techniques to reduce
partial diﬀerential-operator equations with the Fredholm operator in the
main expression to regular problems. In addition this techniques has been
exploited to prove a theorem of existence and uniqueness of a singular
initial problem, as well as to construct the left and right regularizators
of singular operators in Banach spaces and to construct fundamental
operators in the theory of generalized solutions of singular equations.

Introduction

Let

x = (t, x ) be a point in the space Rm+1 ,
x = (x1 , . . . , xm ), D = (Dt , Dx1 , . . . , Dxm ),
α = (α0 , . . . , αm ), | α |= α0 + α1 + · · · αm , where

We also suppose that Bα : Dα ⊂ E1 → E2 are closed linear operators with dense
domains in E1 , x ∈ Ω, where Ω ⊂ Rm+1 , | t |≤ T, E1 , E2 are Banach spaces.
Let us consider the following operator
αi are integer non-negative indexes, Dα =

Bα Dα .

L(D) =

(1)

|α|≤l

The operator |α|=l Bα Dα we call the main part of L(D). Due to its theoretical
signiﬁcance and numerous applications (see [1], [2], [8], [9]) the most interesting
case is when the operator L(D) contains a Fredholm operator Bl0...0 ≡ B in the
higher derivative Dtl .
If N (B) = {0}, then the operator L(D) is called a singular diﬀerential operator. A singular operator of the ﬁrst order

research approaches in the semigroup theory (the bibliography and mechanical
models are represented in [9]). The investigations similar to our research, considering the case when x ∈ Rm+1 are represented in [7], [8]. Below we use some
results from [3], [4], [7].
We consider the equation
L(D)u = f (x),

(3)

where f : Ω → E2 is an analytical function of x suﬃciently smooth of t. The
Cauchy problem for (3), when E1 = E2 = Rn and the matrix B = Bl0...0 is
not degenerated, has been thoroughly studied in fundamental papers by I.G.
Petrovsky (see [5]). In the case when the operator B is not invertible the theory
of initial and boundary value problems for (3) is not developed even for the case
of ﬁnite dimensions. In general, the standard Cauchy problem with conditions
Dti u|t=0 = gi (x ), i = 0, . . . , l − 1, for (3) has no classical solutions for an
arbitrary right part f (x).
The motive of our investigations is the wish to conceive the statement of initial and boundary value problems for the systems of partial diﬀerential equations
with the Fredholm operator in the main part and also their applications. In this
paper we show that we can get a reasonable statement of the initial problems
for such systems by decomposing the space E1 on the direct sum of subspaces in
accordance with the Jordan structure ( [8], [10]) of the operator coeﬃcients Bα ,
and imposing conditions on projections of the solution. Here we suppose that B
is a closed Fredholm operator, D(B) ⊆ D(Bα ) ∀α, and among the coeﬃcients
Bα there is an operator A = Bl1 0...0 , l1 < l, with respect to which B has the
complete A-Jordan set [10].
In Section 1 the suﬃcient conditions of existence of the unique solution of
equation (3) with the initial conditions
Dti u|t=0 = gi (x ), i = 0, 1, . . . , l1 − 1,

(4)

(I − P )Dti u|t=0 = gi (x ), i = l1 , . . . , l − 1,

(5)

are obtained, where gi (x ) are analytical functions with values in E1 , P gi (x ) =
0, i = l1 , . . . , l − 1. Here P is the projector of E1 onto corresponding A-root
subspace. In Section 2 the left and right regularizators of singular operators in
Banach spaces have been constructed. A method of fundamental operators for
construction of the solution in the class of Schwarz distributions [6] is considered
in Section 3. We hope that these investigations can be useful for considering of
new applications [8], [9] of singular diﬀerential systems.

Note that due to the structure of projectors P, Q the identity Γ Q = P Γ holds.
The spaces E2k , E2∞−k are invariant subspaces of the operator Γ . Taking into
account that operator Γ is a bounded one, D(B) ⊆ D(Bα ) and D(Bα ) = E1 ,
we obtain Bα Γ ∈ L(E1 → E2 ).
Thus by substituting (6) into (3) and projecting the result onto the subspace

Q(f −
|α|≤l,α∈(q1 ,q3 )

Recall that if α ∈ q0 , then Mα = ATα . Thus, for k = n according to (10) it
follows that
Ml0...0 = 0, Ml1 0...0 = E,
and for k > n the matrices Ml0...0 , Ml1 0...0 are deﬁned from (9).
Theorem 1. Suppose conditions 1 and 2 are satisﬁed, the function f (x) is an
analytical on x and suﬃciently smooth on t. Suppose
1. (q2 , q4 ) ⊂ q0 or (q1 , q3 ) ⊂ q0 ;
2. QBα P = 0 for all α ∈ (q0 , q3 , q4 ) \ (l0 . . . 0), (l1 0 . . . 0).
Then the problem (3), (4), (5) has a unique classical solution (6).
Proof. Note that for α ∈ q0 , and for any C the equality (I −Q)Bα (Dα C, Φ) = 0
holds and QBα Γ v = 0, where Qv = 0. Thus, according to condition 1 of this
theorem the right-hand side of (11) is independent on the vector-function C(x),
or the right-hand side of (12) is independent on v(x). The equation (11) is
solvable with respect to Dtl v, i.e. has the Kovalevskaya form with the bounded
operator coeﬃcients. Due to condition 2 of this theorem the system (12) takes
the following form
Ml0...0 Dtl C + Ml1 0...0 Dtl1 C = b(x, v).

(13)

If k = n, then Ml0...0 = 0, Ml1 0...0 = E and system (13) has the order l1 . If
k > n then system (13) is split on n independent subsystems:

(14)

where i = 1, n, k = 1, pi − 1. Each subsystem (14) is regular, since it is a
recurrent sequence of diﬀerential equations of order l1 . Thus systems (11), (12)
with boundary conditions (7), (8) have the Kovalevskaya form and therefore
have the unique solution. Taking v and C from the regular systems (11), (12)
and substituting them into (6), we obtain the needed solution.
Remark 1. Let the operators Bα in condition 2 depend on x for α = (l0 . . . 0),
(l1 0 . . . 0). Then the coeﬃcients in the systems (11), (12) also depend on x. If
these coeﬃcients are analytical on x and suﬃciently smooth on t, then theorem
1 is valid. Required smoothness on t for these coeﬃcients and f (x) is deﬁned by
maximum length of A-Jordan chains of operator B.

The Left and Right Regularizators of Singular
Operators in Banach Spaces

Let A and B be constant linear operators from E1 to E2 , where E1 and E2 are
Banach spaces, x(t) is an abstract function, t ∈ Rn with the values in E1 (E2 ).
The set of such functions we denote by Xt (Yt ). We introduce the operator Lt , deﬁned on Xt and Yt and which is commutable with operators B, A. The examples
of such operator Lt are diﬀerential and integral operators, diﬀerence operators
and their combinations. Note that if operators are solved according to higher
order derivatives, then they usually generate correct initial and boundary value
problems. In other cases, when operators are unsolved according to higher order
derivatives, we get the singular problems (see sec.1).
Let us consider the operator Lt B − A, which acts from Xt to Yt , where
B, A are closed linear operators from E1 to E2 with the dense domains, and
D(B) ⊆ D(A). If B is invertable, then the operator Lt B − A can be reduced to
regular operator by multiplication on B −1 . If B is uninvertable, then Lt B − A
is called the singular operator. Let operator B in Lt B − A be Fredholm and
dim N (B) = n ≥ 1. If λ = 0 is an isolated singular point of the operatorfunction B −λA, then the operators Lt B −A, BLt −A admit some regularization.
For explicit construction of regularizations we use the Schmidt pseudo resolvent
ˆ = B + n < ., A∗ ψ (pi ) > Aφ(pi ) . On the base of condition

Fundamental Operator-Functions of Singular Partial
Diﬀerential and Diﬀerential-Diﬀerence Operators in
Banach Spaces

Since the standard Cauchy problem for equation (3) with the Fredholm operator
Bl0...0 in general has no classical solution, then it will be interesting to extend
the notion of solution and to seek generalized solution in a distribution space
[6].
The most interesting is the construction of the fundamental operator functions for the singular diﬀerential operators in Banach spaces which help to obtain
the generalized solutions in closed forms.
Here we construct the fundamental operator functions for the following mappings
∂ 2N u
∂u
− A(u(t, x − µ) − u(t, x)),
B N N − Au, B
∂x ∂y
∂t
where B is a Fredholm operator.
The basic information on generalized functions in Banach spaces, their properties and operations can be found in [3], [8].
Theorem 3. Suppose that condition 1 is satisﬁed. Then the mapping
Bδ (x)δ (y) −Aδ(x)δ(y) in the space K (E2 ) has the fundamental operator function of the form

The following theorem can be proved similarly.

If additionally the singular components of the generalized solutions are equal
to zero then, ﬁrstly, generalized solutions coincide with continuous (classical)
solutions, and, secondly, we can deﬁne a set of the boundary values α(y) and
β(x) and right sides f (x, y), for which such problems are solvable in the class of
