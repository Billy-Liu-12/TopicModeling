Abstract. The aim of this paper is to describe a theoretical background of systematic computer algebra methods for analyzing the free
and steady-state periodic vibrations of the nonlinear structures. Many
analytical steady-state solution methods are developed but each of them
has diﬀerent capabilities. On the other hand, it is very important to assess the eﬃciency of analytical methods in terms of the computer algebra
system. For this reason, the computer algebra system VIBRAN was used.
In this paper, the eﬃciency of two analytical methods is assessed from
the standpoint of the computer algebra system.

Introduction

When a nonlinear structure is subjected to harmonically varying forces, it ﬁrst
passes through a transient state and afterwards it reaches a steady-state or
executes chaotic motions. Some steady-states can be non-periodic, but mostly
the periodic steady-states are observed. Two related problems of interest are
the periodic behavior of structure undergoing harmonic excitation and a free
vibration of structure.
Natural vibration of nonlinear systems is of primary concern in studying the
resonance phenomena because the backbone curves (the amplitude-frequency relations) and the modes of vibrations, i.e. dynamic characteristics of systems, are
determined. Analytical expressions for the backbone curves are very complex and
numerical methods are not a convenient way to analyze nonlinear oscillations.
In some cases, such as the one in a range where the internal resonance exists, the corresponding backbone curves have a very complex shape owing to the
presence of sharp peaks, looping characteristic and rapidly changing slopes. It is
diﬃcult to determine these types of backbone curves by the developed numerical
methods [1], [2]. Simulations by means of numerical methods are powerful tools
for investigations in mechanics, however, they have serious drawbacks, e.g., ﬁnite precision, diﬃculties in determining transient states and steady-states, the
investigation of stability is errorprone and complex.
The analytical steady-state solution by hand requires a lot of routine work,
is errorprone and available only for very simple systems. Here the computerized
symbolic manipulation systems – so called computer algebra – are indispensable

tools. Symbolic manipulations provided by computer algebra systems in combination with high-power number crunching abilities of traditional hardware and
software really opens a new way to large-scale computations needed in steadystate solutions and the stability analysis [3], [5], [9].
The aim of this paper is to describe a theoretical background of systematic
computer algebra methods for analyzing the free and steady-state periodic vibrations of the nonlinear structures. Many analytical steady-state solution methods
are developed, but each of them has diﬀerent capabilities, e.g., small parameter
methods give a solution in close form and the harmonic balance method only
converts nonlinear diﬀerential equations to algebraic. On the other hand, it is
very important to assess the eﬃciency of analytical methods in terms of view
of a computer algebra system. For this reason, the computer algebra system
VIBRAN [4] was used. The computer algebra system VIBRAN is a FORTRAN
preprocessor for analytical computation with polynomials, rational functions,
and trigonometric series.
The main VIBRAN distinction from other computer algebra systems is the
representation form of analytical expressions. Analytical expressions are stored
in matrix form and analytical perturbations are replaced by matrix operations.
Analytical operations could be performed by calling VIBRAN procedures directly from the FORTRAN code.
Figure 1 illustrates the VIBRAN procedure fragment to perform Fourier
transformation. A special VIBRAN procedure can generate an optimized FORTRAN code from the obtained analytical expressions, that can be directly used
in the programs for numerical analysis. In this paper eﬃciency of two analytical
methods is assessed by point of view of computer algebra system VIBRAN.

Realization of a Small Parameter Method

The small parameter method (Poincare method) [7] was developed to solve systems of quazi-nonlinear diﬀerential equations. Consider the algorithm of the
small parameter method realized by the computer algebra system VIBRAN for
systems of nonlinear diﬀerential equations. For the sake of clarity, an algorithm
of the small parameter method is presented for one equation below:

Computer Algebra for Analyzing the Vibrations of Nonlinear Structures

x
¨ + k 2 x + f (t) = µF (t, x, x,
˙ µ).

(1)

where x, x,
˙ x
¨ – displacement, velocity and acceleration;
µ – small parameter;
f (t) – continuous periodical time function with a period 2π;
k – constant, not integer in nonresonant case and integer in a resonant case;
F (t, x, x,
˙ µ) – integer polynomial function and periodical with respect to t.
The solution of equation (1) by the small parameter method [7] could be
found in the form:
x = x0 + µx1 + µ2 x2 + µ3 x3 + . . . ,

(2)

where x0 is the solution of equation (1) without nonlinearities, xi , i = 1, 2, 3, . . .
are unknown functions of t with a period 2π.
To ﬁnd these functions, the series (2) is substituted into equation (1) and
coeﬃcients with the corresponding µ power are equalized. With respect to µ
power, linear diﬀerential equations are obtained:
x
¨i + k 2 xi = Fi ,

i = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

(3)

where Fi are integer rational functions of x0 , x1 , . . . , xi−1 ; x˙ 0 , x˙ 1 , . . . , x˙ i−1 and
continuous periodical function with respect to t. The solution of equations (3)
in non resonant case could be found in the form:

xi =

j=1

(4)

where aij and bij are Fourier series coeﬃcients of function Fi .
In the resonant case, where k is integer and nearly equal or equal to n, that
means
n2 − k 2 = εµ,
where ε has ﬁnite value, the zero power solution must be expressed in the form
x0 = ϕ0 (t) + M0 cos(nt) + N0 sin(nt),
x1 = ϕ1 (t) + M1 cos(nt) + N1 sin(nt),
and the i-th power solution could be expressed in the same manner.
In the general case, M0 and N0 could be found from the equations:
2π

F t, ϕ0 + M0 cos(nt) + N0 sin(nt),
0

ϕ˙ 0 − M0 n sin(nt) + N0 n cos(nt), 0 sin(nt)dt = 0,

where ϕ0 is the solution of equation (1) in the nonresonant case, excluding
resonant harmonics. Other coeﬃcients Mi and Ni could be found from the system

The small parameter method was realized in VIBRAN for both resonant and
nonresonant cases in systems of nonlinear diﬀerential equations [6].

Realization of the Harmonic Balance Method

The harmonic balance method is probably the oldest analytical method in the
theory of nonlinear vibration [6]. Consider the following nonlinear diﬀerential
equation:
x
¨ + f (x, x)
˙ = F (t),
(5)
where x, x,
˙ x
¨ denote displacement, velocity and acceletation; f (x, x)
˙ is a nonlinear function, expandable in Fourier series; F (t) is assumed to be a periodical
function:
∞

F (t) = A0 +

(Ai cos(iωt) + Bi sin(iωt)) .
i=1

751

The solution of the above mentioned equation (5) can be expressed in the
Fourier series in time:
∞

x(t) = a0 +

(ai cos(iωt) + bi sin(iωt)).

(6)

i=1

A nonlinear function is also expanded in the Fourier series in time:
∞

f (x, x)
˙ = α0 +

(αi cos(iωt) + βi sin(iωt)),

(7)

i=1

where Fourier series coeﬃcients are calculated using the following formulas:
2π/ω

˙ cos(iωt)dt;
0

2π/ω

βi =

ω

f (x, x)
˙ sin(iωt)dt.
0

A substitution of formulas (6) and (7) into equation (5) gives an inﬁnite
number of algebraic equations to determine unknown coeﬃcients of solution (6):
α0 = A0 ,
i2 ω 2 ai = αi − Ai ,
i2 ω 2 bi = βi − Bi ,

or
i = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

α0 = α0 (a0 , a1 , b1 , . . .),
αi = αi (a0 , a1 , b1 , . . .),
βi = βi (a0 , a1 , b1 , . . .).

The above mentioned version of the harmonic balance method was realized
in VIBRAN for the system of nonlinear equations [5].

Eﬃciency Assessment for Both Methods

Two VIBRAN programs that realize the above mentioned methods were tested
for the following equation:
x
¨ + c1 x˙ + c2 x + c3 x2 + c4 x3 = d0 + d1 sin(t) + d2 cos(t).
This equation describes dynamics of aerodynamically supported magnetic
head in the recording device [8].
We present below the result of solution for the ﬁrst harmonics, the ﬁrst index
for solution coeﬃcients A and B is the equation number and the second one is
the harmonics number. First result corresponds to the ﬁrst equation in formula
(8) and afterwards we present the result for cosine and sine coeﬃcients of the
ﬁrst term of Fourier series.
The result for the ﬁrst equation of formula (8) is:

In Figure 2, the number of terms in the solution expression (M) for the small
parameter (upper column) and for the harmonic balance method (lower column)
with respect to the number of harmonics (n) in the solution (number of µ power
in the case of small parameter method) are presented.

In Figure 3, the presented graphics illustrates the convergence of above mentioned analytical methods for the four coeﬃcients. The upper curve corresponds
to the harmonic balance method and the lower one corresponds to the small
parameter method.
In this case, the magnetic head construction parameters were:
c1 = 0.1, c2 = 0.228 × 106 c3 = 0.167 × 104 ,
c4 = 0.587 × 103 , d0 = 0, d1 = 0.12, d2 = 0.12.

Conclusions

The comparison of the abovementioned analytical methods illustrates similarities
and diﬀerences of their application. The similarities illustrate tolerance curves,
that are of the same shape.
There are 12045 terms in the solution’s expression for the small parameter
method (5 harmonics), meanwhile only 1524 terms are observed for the harmonic balance method. It means that the harmonic balance method is much
more convenient for computer algebra realization, especially for the systems
with multi-degree-freedom, but needs a special stability analysis procedure for
the steady-state solution.
