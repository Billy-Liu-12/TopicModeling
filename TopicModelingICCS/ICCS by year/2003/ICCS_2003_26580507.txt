Abstract. We develop an approach to the numerical integration of initial value problem for mixed diﬀerence-diﬀerential equations that are
diﬀerential with respect to one argument and diﬀerence with respect to
others. Preliminary reduction of the problem to a set of Cauchy problems
for systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations depending on a parameter
aﬀords to state it as the problem of the continuing the solution with
respect to the best continuation parameter, namely, the integral curve
length. This statement has numerous advantages over the usual statement. Namely, the right-hand sides of the transformed system remain
bounded even if right-hand sides of the original system become inﬁnite
at some points.

Introduction

The general type of mixed functional-diﬀerential equations (MFDE) [1] is
(l)

x(l+1) (s, t) = f (t, s, xts , xts , . . . , xts ),
Here a < s < b , −∞ < a < b < ∞, 0 < t < ∞. The ranges of values of x
and f lie in Rn ; the i-th order derivative of xts with respect to t is denoted as
(i)
xts , i = 1, . . . , l + 1; xts (ϑ, ξ) = x(t + ϑ, s + ξ), −g ≤ ϑ ≤ 0, |ξ| ≤ h; h, g ≥ 0.
A particular case of general MFDE of the form
F (x (s, t), x (s + h1 , t), . . . , x (s + hk , t), x(s, t), x(s + h1 , t), . . . , x(s + hk , t)) = 0,
where x : R2 → R, s ∈ Ω ⊂ Rn , hi ∈ Zn , i = 1, . . . , k, k ∈ N, is called the mixed
diﬀerence-diﬀerential equation (MDDE).
Despite equations of this type have a lot of diﬀerent applications in ecology, biology and physics they have been studied systematically not for a long
time. The exhaustive review of applications and studies is presented in [2], the
general theory of such equations is given in [1]. Paper [3] deals with boundary
value problem for MDDEs which appear from variational problems. Paper [4]

linear MDDE based on ﬁnite diﬀerence method. This work presents an approach
to numerical integration of initial value problem for MDDE transformed to the
best argument. The eﬃciency of the approach is shown on test example.

Initial Value Problem for Mixed Difference-Diﬀerential
Equation

Let consider mixed diﬀerence-diﬀerential equation
R1 (t, s)

∂
x(t, s) = R2 (t, s)g(x(t, s)) + f (t, s),
∂t

((t, s) ∈ Q),

(1)

with boundary condition
((t, s) ∈ (0, T ) × (Rn \ Ω),

x(t, s) = 0,

(2)

and initial condition
x(0, s) = ϕ(s),

(s ∈ Ω).

(3)

n

Here Q = (0, T ) × Ω, Ω ⊂ R is a bounded domain with piecewise-smooth
boundary, 0 < T < ∞, f (t, s) : Q → R and g(x) : R → R;
ahν (t, s)y(t, s + h),

(Rν y)(t, s) =

ν = 1, 2,

h∈H

where H is an additive Abelian group of integer vectors, ahν (t, s) : Q → R,
ν = 1, 2, h ∈ H.
Suppose that f (t, s), ahν (t, s), ν = 1, 2, h ∈ H are continuous functions
with respect to t and piecewise-smooth with respect to s ∈ Q and g(x) is a
continuous function in R.
Let D ⊂ Rn+1 be a bounded domain. Denote by C˜ 1,0 (D) a set of functions
y(t, s) : D → R that are continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to the ﬁrst
argument for almost all values of s and piecewise-smooth with respect to the
second argument. As it was done in [5], introduce operators IQ , PQ , RQ as follows:
IQ : C˜ 1,0 (Q) → C˜ 1,0 ((0, T ) × Rn ) extends a function from the space C˜ 1,0 (Q)
with zero to ((0, T ) × Rn ) \ Q;
PQ : C˜ 1,0 ((0, T ) × Rn ) → C˜ 1,0 (Q) restricts a function from C˜ 1,0 ((0, T ) × Rn )
to Q;
RνQ : C˜ 1,0 (Q) → C˜ 1,0 (Q), ν = 1, 2 are diﬀerence operators given by
RνQ = PQ Rν IQ ,

(ν = 1, 2) .

Deﬁnition 1. A function x(t, s) ∈ C˜ 1,0 (Q) is the solution to problem (1)–(3),
if it satisﬁes the following equation
R1Q (t, s)

∂
x(t, s) = R2Q (t, s)g(x(t, s)) + f (t, s),
∂t

and initial condition

((t, s) ∈ Q),

x(t, s) = ϕ(s),

((t, s) ∈ {0} × Ω),

(5)

for almost all s ∈ Ω.
Note that it is the deﬁnition of diﬀerence operators RνQ that aﬀords to
rearrange equation (1) and boundary condition (2) to equation (4).
It has been proved (see [5]) that Ω \

(∂Ω + h)

breaks into classes of

h∈H

subdomains Ωi j (here and further we use i = 1, . . . , I for a class number and
j = 1, . . . , Ji is a subdomain number in class i). Subdomains Ωi1 j1 and Ωi2 j2
belong to the same class iﬀ there is a vector h ∈ H such that Ωi1 j1 = Ωi2 j2 + h.
Denote
Qi j = (0, T ) × Ωi j .
It is evident that

that is

reverse to Ui . Using the isomorphism Ui , taking into account condition (6) and
permutability of Ui and ∂/∂t, we obtain from equation (4)

Denote vector-valued function Ui x by xi , Ui g(x) by g˜(xi ) and Ui f by f i .
Using this notations, we can rewrite (7) as follows

The proof follows from lemma 8.6, ch. II, [5].
Theorem 1. Let x be the solution to problem (4), (5), then for i = 1, . . . , I
vector-valued function xi = Ui x is the solution to the following problem

i = 1, . . . , I,

is the solution to problem (4), (5).
Note that functions Rνi , g˜, f i , ϕi are supposed to provide the existence and
uniqueness of the solution to problem (10), (11) that is a continuously diﬀerentiable function with respect to t and piecewise continuous function with respect
to s, i.e. xi ∈ C˜J1,0
(Qi1 ).
i
Proof. To begin the proof recall that the solution to problem (10)-(11) is a
function that satisﬁes equation (10) and boundary condition (11) for almost all
s ∈ Ωi1 .
Suppose x is the solution to problem (4), (5). Since equation (7) is equivalent
to equation (4) it follows that vector-valued function xi that is equal to Ui x
satisﬁes equation (8). Taking into account the above notations we obtain that
vector-valued function xi satisﬁes equation (9). Finally, Lemma implies that xi
satisﬁes equation (10).
Analogous reasoning implies that if x satisﬁes initial condition (5) then
vector-valued function xi satisﬁes initial conditions (11) for almost all s. Thus
vector-valued function xi is the solution to problem (10), (11).
Now, suppose that vector-valued function xi (t) is the solution to problem
(10), (11). It is clear that if Rνi (t, s), f i (t, s), ϕi (s) are deﬁned and continuous
for some s ∈ Ωi j then x(t, s) speciﬁed in the statement of the theorem is deﬁned,
continuous with respect to s and continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to t for

The Best Parameterization of Initial Value Problem

511

the same s. Thus relation (6) implies that x(t, s) has the same properties almost
everywhere in Q, i.e. x ∈ C˜ 1,0 (Q).
Since xi , i = 1, . . . , I satisﬁes equation (10) then due to the Lemma it satisﬁes
equation (8). The latter yield that x(t, s) deﬁned in the statement of the theorem
satisﬁes equation (4) almost for all s ∈ Ω. The same speculations show that x
satisﬁes initial condition (5) almost for all s ∈ Ω. Thus, x(t, s) is the solution to
problem (4), (5).
Note to conclude that if f (t, s), ϕ(s), ahν (t, s), ν = 1, 2, h ∈ H, are continuous
functions with respect to s for all s ∈ Ω may be except for points of the set
{s ∈ ∂Ωi j , i = 1, . . . , I, j = 1, . . . , Ji } then the solution to problem (4), (5) is a
continuous function with respect to s for all s ∈ Ω may be except for points of
the same set. It worth adding that generally continuity of f (t, s), ϕ(s), ahν (t, s) in
Q does not yield continuity with respect to s of the solution to problem (4), (5).

The Best Argument of the Problem

To solve the problem of choosing the best argument of problem (4), (5) (the
argument of diﬀerentiation), we exploit the method of the continuation of a
solution. Theorem 1 implies that it is equivalent to seek the best argument of
problem (10), (11).
Suppose matrixes R1i , i = 1, . . . , I, are not singular at (t, s) ∈ Qi1 . Hence we
can transform system (10), (11) to the normal form considering variable s as a
parameter.

dt

(12)

xi (0) = ϕi (s),

(13)

(t ∈ (0, T ), s ∈ Ωi1 ).
Assume that an integral of problem (12), (13) is given by
F (xi1 (t, s), . . . , xir (t, s), t) = 0,
such that

(14)

F (ϕi1 (s), . . . , ϕir (s), 0) = 0, s ∈ Ωi1 ,

where xil are components of xi , ϕil – ϕi , F : Rr+1 → Rr (recall r = Ji ), deﬁnes
a smooth integral curve of the problem in Rr+1 almost for every s ∈ Ωi1 .
We shall handle a process of this curve construction as a process of solving
system (14), where t is the argument of the problem and s is regarded as a parameter, s ∈ Ωi1 . Also we’ll investigate this system by the continuation method
treating initial value problem (12), (13) as the Cauchy problem for continuation
equations for the solution of system (14) with respect to parameter t. Such an
approach has been used to solve the Cauchy problem for a system of ordinary
diﬀerential equation [6] and delayed diﬀerential equation [7], [8].

Theorem 2. To transform the Cauchy problem (12), (13) to the best argument
it is necessary and suﬃcient to choose the arc length λ measured along the integral curve of this problem as a new independent variable for any particular
s ∈ Ωi1 . After transformation problem (12), (13) takes the form

t ∈ (0, T ),

i = 1, . . . , I,

xi (0) = ϕi (s),

(15)

t(0) = 0,

(16)

s ∈ Ωi1 .

Here by (·, ·) inner product in Rr and by Gi = (G1 , . . . , Gr ) vector of righthand side functions of system (12) are denoted. Choice of plus or minus sign
deﬁnes the direction of moving along the integral curve of the problem.
We call an argument to be the best if it provides the linear system of continuation equations whose matrix is the Jacobi matrix of system (14) with the
largest possible condition number at any step of integration process.
Proof. We’ll continue a solution to problem (12), (13) locally, in a small neighborhood of any point of the problem integral curve. Suppose that t and all
components of xi are functions of µ such that
r

∆µ =

cl ∆xil + cr+1 ∆t.

(17)

l=1

Here ∆xil and ∆t are increments of corresponding variables, cl (l = 1, . . . , r + 1)
are components of the unit vector deﬁning a direction in which µ is measured.
Having diﬀerentiated equation (14) with respect to µ as a composite function,
we obtain
r

l=1

Fk,xil xil,µ + Fk,t t,µ = 0,

k = 1, . . . , r,

where the following notations were used

Fk,xil =

Assuming nonsingularity of matrix Fk,xil , we obtain from (18) and (12)
dxil
= −(Fk,xil )−1 (F1,t , . . . , Fr,t )T = Gil .
dt
Hence, equations (18) take the form
xil,µ − Gil t,µ = 0,

l = 1, . . . , r.

(19)

The Best Parameterization of Initial Value Problem

513

Thus (19) implies that equations (12) multiplied by dt and divided by dµ can
be used as continuation equations.
To obtain (r + 1)-th continuation equation one has to divide (17) by ∆µ and
then pass to limit as ∆µ → 0.
r

cl xil,µ + cr+1 t,µ = 1.

(20)

l=1

Thus (19) and (20) constitute the system of continuation equations.
It has been proved (see [9]) that the transformation of this system to the
Cauchy normal form is best conditioned iﬀ cl = xil,λ , l = 1, . . . , r, cr+1 = t,λ .
This means that the arc length measured along the integral curve of problem
(12), (13) is chosen as µ. Hence, system (19), (20) can be rearranged

(xl,λ , xil,λ )

− Gi t,λ = 0,
+ t2,λ = 1.

(21)

Solving (21) for derivatives and measuring λ from initial point of (12), (13)
due to independence of right-hand side functions of the system on λ, we come
to the transformed problem that is of the form given by (15), (16).
Example 1. Let consider the problem
x (t, s − 1) + tx (t, s) + x (t, s + 1) = 1/3x(t, s),

((t, s) ∈ (0, T ) × (0, 2)),

with boundary condition x(t, s) = 0, (t, s) ∈ (0, T ) × (R \ (0, 2)), and initial
condition x(0, s) = ϕ(s), (s ∈ (0, 2)).
In the above notations I = 1, J1 = 2. In this problem diﬀerence operator
generates decomposition of Q = (0, T ) × (0, 2) into subdomains Q11 = (0, T ) ×
(0, 1) and Q12 = (0, T ) × (1, 2). Functions xi and ϕi correspond to each of these
subdomains.

The solution to this problem
x1 = C1 (t + 1)1/3 + C2 (t − 1)1/3 ,
x2 = C1 (t + 1)1/3 − C2 (t − 1)1/3 ,
where C1 = (ϕ1 (s) + ϕ2 (s))/2, C2 = (ϕ1 (s) − ϕ2 (s))/2 are obtained from the
initial condition. As for the solution to the original problem, it has the form
x(t, s) = xi (t, s), (t, s) ∈ Q1 i , i = 1, 2. It is evident that despite the right-hand
side functions of system of diﬀerential equations are unbounded in a neighbourhood of t = ±1 the solution to the problem is a continuous function of t.
Having transformed the problem to the best argument, we obtain

where f1 = 1/3(tx1 − x2 ), f2 = −1/3(x1 − tx2 ).
Note that right-hand side functions of the transformed system are continuous
and uniformly bounded functions of t. It yields that the solution to the problem
is a continuously diﬀerentiable function of λ.
Numerical tests demonstrate that unboundedness of the right-hand side functions of a system of diﬀerential equations may make impossible the implementation of standard numerical integration procedures. Preliminary transformation
of a system to the best argument aﬀords to avoid similar diﬃculties.
