Abstract. Electronic structure of X60 molecules (X=C, Si) is considered in
terms of 60 odd electrons and spin-dependent interaction between them.
Conditions for the electrons to be excluded from the covalent pairing are
discussed. A computational spin-polarized quantum-chemical scheme is
suggested to evaluate four parameters (energy of radicalization, exchange
integral, atom spin density, and squared spin eigenvalue) to characterize the
effect quantitatively. A polyradical character of the species, weak for C60 and
strong for Si60, is established.

1 Introduction
It cannot be said that fullerenes suffer from the lack of theoretical considerations.
Both a basic molecule C60 and its homologues C70, C84, etc. as well as analogues Si60,
Ge60 have been repeatedly and thoroughly studied [see 1-7 and references therein]. In
some sense, the molecule turned out to be a proving ground for testing different
computational techniques, from a simplest to the most sophisticated. Constantly
justifying the molecule stability, steadily repeated attempts of the molecule
calculations are concentrated mainly on the reliability of reproducing the molecule
structure and its possible distortion. There have been no doubts therewith concerning
covalent bonding of atoms in the molecules. It has been taken for granted that all
valence electrons participate in covalent pairing. That was the reason for the closed
shell approximation to be exploited independently of whichever computational
method has been used. The first breakdown of the assurance of the approach validity
has been made by a comparative examination of the C60 and Si60 molecules [8-10] that
has shown a strange feature in the high-spin states behavior of the molecules. As
occurred, a sequence of spin-varying states, singlet (RHF)-triplet-quintet formed a
progressively growing series by energy for the C60 molecule while for the Si60
molecule energy of the triplet and quintet states turned out to drop drastically with
respect to the RHF singlet. Obviously, the peculiarity has clearly demonstrated the
difference in the electronic structure of both molecules. However, as occurred, the
observation is of much bigger importance since it concerns the basic properties of odd
electrons behavior in fullerenic structures. The current paper is devoted to the
phenomenon which is based on the violation of the odd electrons covalent coupling.
The paper is arranged in the following way. Section 1 is devoted to conceptual
grounds of the carried computational experiment. Computational techniques used in

the study is described in Section 2. Section 3 presents the results for lone pairs of odd
electrons a well as for a set of pairs incorporated in the C60 and Si60 structures. The
essentials of the study are discussed in Section 4.

2 Conceptual Grounds
Fullerenes are typical species with odd electrons that is why a concept on aromaticity
has been expanded over the species since the very moment of their discovery [11].
However further examinations have highlighted that in spite of extreme conjugation,
fullerenes behave chemically and physically as electron-deficient alkenes rather than
electron-rich aromatic systems [12] so that the electrons pairing seems to be the main
dominant of electronic structure. Conceptually, the problem of an electron pair is
tightly connected with a fundamental problem of quantum theory related to the
hydrogen molecule. According to the Heitler-London theory [13], two hydrogen
atoms (electrons) retain their individuality (atomic orbitals, involving spin), and look
like two individual radicals with spin S=1/2 when they are far from each other (weak
interaction). When the distance approaches the interatomic chemical bond (strong
interaction), the electrons, as well as their spins, become delocalized over both atoms,
their properties are described by generalized molecular function (molecular orbital)
and spins are aligned in an antiparallel way to provide tight covalent bonding
between the atoms. As shown by forthcoming calculations [14], a continuos transition
in the electron behavior from free radical-like to tightly coupled covalent bonding is
observed indeed when the distance between the atoms changes from the infinity to the
chemical bond length. By other words, the covalent bonding fades away when the
electron interaction is weakening.
In the consequence of the topic of the current papers, two problems should be
pointed out when this fundamental finding occurred to be of crucial importance. The
first concerns diradicals in organic chemistry [15-22]. The phenomenon is caused by a
pair of odd electrons connected with either C-C or C-N and N-N atom pairs and is
common for species largely varying by composition. Generalizing its main aspects,
the phenomenon essentials are caused by a violation of the above-mentioned atomic
coupling from the covalent one in the part connected with odd electrons. Scheme in
Fig.1 explains the main points of the diradical problem. Initially doubly degenerated
atomic levels ΨA, and ΨB are splitted due to electron interaction with the energy
difference ∆ε . Two spins of the relevant electrons can be distributed over the splitted
levels by five different ways. Configurations I, II, III, and IV are related to singlet
state while the only configuration V describes the triplet one. As a result, the triplet
state is spin-pure at any ∆ε, while the singlet state is either purely covalent
(configuration I) and, consequently, spin-pure at large ∆ε, or is a mixture of
configurations I-IV and becomes spin-mixed. The energy difference ∆ε turns out to be
the main criterion for attributing the species to either covalently bound or diradical
species and the analysis of carbenes [18,22] can be considered as the best example of
this kind.
The other problem is related to molecular magnets presented by dimers composed
of two transition metal atoms surrounded by extended molecular ligands [23-25]. Odd

electrons are associated with the metal atoms and their interaction is a priori weak. As
previously, the triplet state is spin-pure while the singlet state is spin-mixed and is
described by a combination of functions Ψ1, Ψ2, and Ψ3.1 First attempts of the
electron interaction analysis have been based on the direct consideration of
configuration interaction [23,24]. Later on Noodleman [25] suggested an alternative
while practically feasible computational scheme based on quantum-chemical spinpolarized technique.
Following these general concepts, two fullerenes C60 and Si60 have been
considered in the current study. The analysis has been done in due course of extended
computational experiment fulfilled in the framework of spin-polarised Hartree-Fock
calculations that has highlighted the main characteristics which are responsible for the
molecule peculiar behavior.

3 Exchange Integrals
As shown for both diradicals [18,19] and molecular magnets [24], the criterion based
on the quantity ∆ε lays the foundation of a qualitative analysis of the phenomenon,
whilst important when tracing the odd electrons behavior when changing, say,
structural parameters of the species. At the same time, as shown in the previous
Section, the peculiarities of the odd electron pair behavior are caused by spin-mixing
related to the singlet state of the pair. Therefore, the spin-dependent energy should be
more appropriate quantitative characteristic of the phenomenon. Actually, as
mentioned earlier, the value gradually decreases when weakening the electron
interaction as shown for the hydrogen molecule [14]. In its turn, decreasing the value
under controlled conditions will indicate growing the deviation of the electron
coupling from the covalent bonding. Therefore, the problem is concentrated now
around correct estimation of the value.
Let us consider two limit cases of strong and weak electron interaction. Obviously,
diatomic molecules cover the former case. According to the Heitler-London theory
[13], the energy of states of spin multiplicity 2S+1, where S is full spin of two atoms
with spins SA and SB each, ranging from 0 to SA +SB, can be expressed as

1

The configuration Ψ4 is usually omitted since the relevant state energy is high.

Violation of Covalent Bonding in Fullerenes

E 2 S +1 = E (0) − 4S A S B J AB ~ E ′(0) + S ( S − 1) J AB .

389

(1)

Here E(0) and/or E ′(0) is the energy of the singlet state formed by covalently
coupled electron pairs, SA and SB denote remained free spin of atoms A and B,
integral JAB describes the electron exchange. In case of homonuclear molecules,

S Amax = S Bmax = n / 2 , where n determines the number of unpaired electrons. The
expression was inspired by the Heizenberg theory of ferromagnetism [26] and
occurred to be quite useful practically in describing high-spin states of diatomic
molecules [13]. Shown, the exchange integral is negative for the majority of
molecules with only rare exclusion such as oxygen molecule and a few others.
Silently implied therewith, the high-spin states are spin-pure that explains the
appearance of spin-dependent part in Ex.(1) in form S ( S − 1) J AB where factor S(S∧
2

1) corresponds to the eigen value of operator S . Applying to the general problem
of odd electrons, Ex.(1) suggests the integral JAB to be the main energetic criterion of
the electron behavior in the limit of strong interaction. In what follows, the expression
will be in use in the form

multiplicities, respectively. A practical usefulness of the expression is resulted from
the fact that both needed energies can be quite accurately determined by using modern
quantum-chemical tools. Obviously, spin-polarized techniques should be used. The
0

value E , related to covalently bound singlet state, is well determined by a closed
shell version of the technique while that simultaneously provides reliable
2S

determination of the E max value that corresponds to the ferromagnetic alignment
of all spins. The ferromagnetic spin configuration is unique under any conditions (see
Fig.1) so that the relevant solution is always true and the corresponding eigen

functions satisfy both the Hamiltonian and S operator equations. Below a spinpolarized Hartree-Fock technique will be used for the values determination so that
Ex.(2) can be rewritten in the following way

J=

.
S max ( S max − 1)

(3)

Oppositely to covalently bound unique singlet state in the limit of strong
interaction, the state becomes broken by both space and spin symmetry [27] when odd
electron interaction weakens. As suggested in [25], the one-determinant singlet wave
function in this case can be expressed as

390

E.F. Sheka

ψ B = ( N !)−1 / 2 M −1 / 2 det[(a1 + cb1 )α , a 2α ...a nα (b1 + ca1 )β , b2 β ...bn β ]
≈ M −1 / 2 (φ1 + cφ 2 + cφ 3 ).

(4)

The principal determinant φ1 describes pure covalent coupling of n odd electrons2
while small amounts of the charge transfer determinants φ2 and φ3, corresponding to

A − − B + and A + − B − configurations (see II and III in Fig.1) are mixed in due to
nonorthogonality of atomic orbitals a1 = a1 + cb1 and b1 = b1 + ca1 . The open

shell manner for the function

ψB

expression is just appropriate to distinguish

electron spins of atoms A and B. The function describes the singlet state and
corresponds to the antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling of odd electrons.
As shown in [25], the energy of the above AF state is a specific weighted average
of the energies of the pure spin multiplets. However, according to Ex.(4) it can be
expressed as

E B ≡ E UHF
= E cov − E rad ,
AF

(5)

where the latter is originated from the ionic contributions and is an independent
measure of the deviation of the AF coupling energy from the covalent one. The term
can be called as the energy of either radicalization, or spin-mixing, or non-covalence
depending on which namely aspect is to be emphasized. In what follows the first
nomination is preferred. Since both energies E AF and E cov = E AF can be
calculated within the same QCh approach by using the corresponding open shell and
closed shell versions, the E rad energy can be readily evaluated as the
UHF

difference E rad

E rad ≥ 0 .
When odd electrons are covalently coupled,

and, consequently,
AF

E rad = 0 . The corresponding exchange integral J which provides the high-spin
series of the electron energies has to be determined by Ex.(3). In its turn, E rad ≠ 0 is
an unambiguous indication that the odd electron coupling deviates from the covalent
one. As suggested in [25], the J values can be determined therewith according to the
following expressions

corresponds to a true solution of the relevant QCh equations. According to [25],
energies of the series of high-spin-pure states are described as

(9)

It is important to notice that Exs. (3), (6)-(9) are valid not only for lone pair of odd
electrons. They retain their form in the case of n identical pairs with that difference
that the exchange integral J is substituted by ~J/n. In the weak interaction limit it is
followed from the explicit expressions for the integral [25]. In the limit of strong
interaction it was proved by a comparative study of the H2 and H6 systems [14, 28].
Expressions (3), (7) and (8) form the ground of the carried computational
experiment which is aimed at analysis of the odd electron properties of two fullerene
molecules C60 and Si60. The computations have been performed by using
semiempirical spin-polarized CLUSTER-Z1 sequential codes [29] in the version
which is adequate to the AM1 technique [30]. Additionally to the mentioned, two
other quantities were calculated, namely, eigenvalues of the

4 Results
4.1 Electron Pair in the X60 Structure
In both organic and silicon chemistry the atom composition of pairs with odd
electrons is rather variable (see, for example, [15,19]). Below we shall restrict
ourselves by pairs of the > - < and >Si-Si< (below >X-X<) type only, where each
atom is connected with three neighbors and which are characteristic for fullerenes X60.
Individual pairs in the fullerenes structure can be formed by a virtual dehydrogenation
of the X60 60 molecules, as shown in Fig.2. Both basic molecules are tightly bonded
covalently with E rad = 0 (see Table 1). Similar hexagon fragments were selected
within the molecule structure which were then partially dehydrogenated that resulted
in the formation of 1,2- and 1,4- pairs of odd electrons. The calculated values

Application of the above semi-empirical technique is not crucial for the study from a
conceptual viewpoint. Only its highly effective computational facilities has favored the choice.
Spin-polarized DFT techniques works in similar situations absolutely analogously [33, 34],
however their rather modest computational efficiency seriously prevents from carrying out an
extended computational experiment which involves multiple studying of large systems at
different spin multiplicity.

According to Hoffman’s classification [18], the first of the mentioned pairs is
related to via space one while the other presents a via bond pair. As seen from the
table, the formation of the 1,2-pair in the 60 58 molecule does not disturb the
covalent bonding since, as previously, E rad = 0 so that E AF and E FUHF describe
spin-pure states with spin density at atoms equal either to zero or to one in the singlet
and triplet states, respectively. Exchange parameter J is rather big and similar to that
one of the ethylene molecule (see Table 1). The other pair of the 60 58 molecule is
characterized by a significant energy E rad , small exchange parameter J and
UHF

noticeable deviation of the calculated values <S**2>UHF from exact. Taking together,
the features doubtlessly show the deviation from the covalent coupling in the pair that
forces to take it as a diradical as conventionally accepted.
Oppositely to the carbon species, the formation of any pair in the Si60 58 molecule
is followed by well evident diradical effects. Thus, energy E rad > 0 for both pairs;
the values <S**2>UHF differ form the exact ones; atomic spin density Sat at the pair
atoms is large in the spin-mixed singlet state and considerably exceeds 1 in the triplet.
As previously, the 1,2-pair and 1,4- pair differ rather drastically. The diradical
character of both pairs is quite obvious. The discussed characteristics of the Si60 60
molecule pairs are similar to those of silicoethylene (see Table 1). As known [35], the
latter does not exist in the gaseous state and is mentioned with respect to
silicoethylene polymer that might be explained by its evidently diradical character.

4.2 Set of Odd Electron Pairs in the X60 Structures
If lone odd electron pairs have been considered at least qualitatively and semiquantitatively [18, 19, 22], the only study of a cyclic H6 cluster [14,28] can be
attributed to the examination of the pair sets. At the same time sets of pairs > - <
are >Si-Si< not a rarity for both organic and silicon chemistry. Enough to mention
well extended class of aromatic compounds.
Since hexagon motive X6 is deeply inherent in fullerenic structures, its
exploitation as a model set of odd electron pairs seems quite natural. Additionally, X10
configuration attracts attention since there are strong arguments to consider the

and X6 fragment. There are three electron pairs in the molecular structures,
= 3 , and the relevant state of the ferromagnetic aligning of six spins

corresponds to septet. As seen from Table 2, the C6 6 molecule is tightly bound
covalently, E rad = 0 . Both singlet and septet states are spin-pure, however, the
singlet state spin density is slightly nonzero and is regularly distributed over the
molecule atoms with values shown in the table. The exchange parameter J is still big
whilst lower with respect to that of ethylene molecule. The benzene fragment 6 of
the 60 54 molecule behaves fully similarly so that its formation does not affect the
covalent bonding. As in the case of the C6 6 molecule, singlet state spin density on
the benzene fragment atoms is also nonzero and bigger than previously.
Absolutely another picture can be seen for the Si6 6 molecule while both the
molecule itself and its Si6 analogue in the Si60 54 species behave quite similarly.
Those are characterized by large values of E rad , by small parameter J and by atomic
spin densities, similar in value in both singlet and septet state. The latter is spin-pure
enough while the singlet state is evidently spin-mixed since the obtained

S max = 5 , and the multiplicity of the ferromagnetic state is 11. Analyzing data given
in Table 2, an unexpected discovery can be made concerning the violation of the
molecule covalent bonding in the naphthalene 10 8. As far as known, the stability of
the covalent bound singlet state of the molecule has never been in doubt. However,
the carried calculations show that not only E rad noticeably differs from zero but

is non-zero as well showing spin-mixed character of the singlet state.

High values of atomic spin density are also remarkable. The findings evidence
convincingly a polyradical behavior of the molecule, though not too strong As seen
from Table 2, the tendency is not only kept but even strengthened for the

The data in Table 2 related to siliconathtalene and Si10 fragment of the Si60 50
molecule leave no doubts concerning polyradical character of both molecules.
Evidently, the effect is much bigger comparing with that of carbon species. For both

)XOOHUHQHV 60 and Si60. There are 30 odd electron pairs in each molecule,
S max = 30 , and the multiplicity of the states with ferromagnetic alignment of all 60
spins is 61. As seen from Table 2,

E rad > 0 for both molecules, for the Si60 just

drastically. The UHF singlet states are spin-mixed, and again, the mixing for silicon
species is just enormous that is seen from the deviation of the

S * *2

UHF

values

from zero. In both cases atomic spin density is quite considerable and is distributed
over atoms in a rather complicated way. Fig.4 presents the spin density distribution in
a manner when the presented value gradually grows from the left to the right while
the sums over the values in both cases are zero. White-and-black image of the X60
molecule shown in the figure insert highlights the space distribution of positive and
negative spin density over atoms. Taking together, the presented data make a
polyradical character of the odd electron bonding in both molecules completely
evident.

Discussion

The carried analysis has convincingly shown that X60 fullerene composition of atoms
with odd electrons results in weakening the covalent bonding that is just drastic in the
case of silicon species. To describe the phenomenon concisely, the term
polyradicalization has been suggested to emphasize that a rather peculiar chemical
behavior should be expected from the species. As shown in the study, four parameters
can be proposed to describe the effect quantitatively. The main parameter

E rad = E RHF − E UHF
indicates straightforwardly the bonding weakening, when it
AF
is non-zero. Three other parameters, namely, exchange parameter J,
and
6

S * *2

UHF

,

Sp A , describe quantitatively conditions under which the weakening occurs.

The disclosed feature has forced us to check the tendency for a series of aromatic
hydrocarbons. The calculations have convincingly shown the strengthening of the effect
when going from naphthalene to pentacene for both carbon and silicon species. The results
will be partially discussed in the next Section.

Taking together, they provide a complete picture of the phenomenon discussed.
Additionally, the computational approach used makes it possible to determine the
energy of high-spin states of the studied compounds. Fig.5 presents the data related to
E(S) and

S * *2

UHF

calculated in accordance with Exs. (8) and (10) for both C60
UHF

and Si60 species. The series of the E
(S ) energies of spin-mixed states, calculated
straightforwardly by using the applied tool, are included for comparison. As seen
from the figure, the difference between the series of spin-pure and spin-mixed states
is not too big as might be expected. This is much more surprising since the calculated

E UHF (S ) relate to the optimized structures which are different for different spin
states, sometimes rather significantly, while the E(S) series is related to the same
structure. A conclusion can be made that the applied spin-polarized QCh tool provides
a quite reliable presentation of high-spin states. Curves 3 in the figure plots the ratio

ς (%) =

S * *2

UHF

− S ( S − 1)

S ( S − 1)

which characterizes spin purity of the states. As

seen from the figure, in the case of C60, the high-spin states become spin-pure at
rather low spin values while only at high spins the similar is observed for the Si60
molecule.
Even in the first studies of diradicals, Hoffman [16-18] and other authors [19]
have tried to exhibit the criterion of the transition from covalent pairing to odd
electron pair radicalization. However, only the energy difference ∆ε = ε 2 − ε 1
between the energies of two orbitals of the pair was suggested that was not enough to
formalize the criterion. A considerable extension of the number of quantitative
parameters, readily accessible by the modern spin-polarized QCh techniques, makes
now possible to suggest a formal criterion for the transition. Given in Fig. 6 presents

values (see text)

the dependence of E rad versus exchange parameter J on the basis of the data
summarized in Table 3. As seen, the dependence for both carbon and silicon species
is quite similar and exhibits a clearly seen quasi-threshold character. One may
conclude that for the studied species the transition starts when J reaches ~10 kcal/mol.
Dependencies E rad (J ) , or more precise, the steepness of the curves after
transition, well formalize the difference in the polyradicalization of different species.
As seen in the figure, the steepness is a few times more for the silicon species in
comparison with carbon molecules. The obvious preference shown by silicon atoms
towards polyradicalization instead of double bond formation is well supported by high
values of atomic spin densities (see Tables 1 and 2). The latter quantity, in its turn, is
provided by electrons taken out of chemical bonding [39]. Actually, Fig.7 presents

generalized bond index7, summarized over all atoms excluding atom A. A close
similarity should be noted between the two values, which are calculated
independently. Taking together, the data present a quantitative explanation of the
difference in bonding carbon and silicon atoms and answer the question why silicon
atoms “dislike” sp2 hybridization [9,10]. Qualitatively, this can be described in the
following way. While carbon atom interaction forces odd electron to participate in the
action thus strengthening it, silicon atoms prefer to leave the odd electrons free in a
form of spin density, while the atom interaction is kept at much weaker level. The
obtained findings throw light as well on why “…A comparison of the chemistry of
tetravalent carbon and silicon reveals such gross differences that the pitfalls of casual
analogies should be apparent” [42].

Thus disclosed polyradical character of the basic fullerene molecule C60 is well
consistent with extreme diversity of its properties which sometimes seem to be even
contradictory. Enough to mention, for example, diamagnetism of a free molecule and
pristine C60 crystals [43,44] and a ferromagnetic behavior of either carpet-like
polymerized crystalline species [45] or TDAE- C60 charge complex [46]. However,
even Salem and Rowland have already mentioned [19] that diradical electronic
structure is readily amenable to any external effects caused by either intramolecular
chemical substitution or by intermolecular interaction. Actually, recent studies have
shown [47] that above mentioned peculiarities in the magnetic behavior are tightly
connected with changing the main polyradical characteristics E rad , J, and Sp A .
Another examples of “strange” behavior of the C60 admixtures such as effective

A generalized bond index is determined as K AB = PAB 2 + Sp AB 2 [40], where the first term is
known as Wiberg’s bond index [41] which was introduced to characterize the covalence of
chemical bonds in molecules with closed electron shells while the second goes from the spin
density matrix.

inhibition of radical destruction of polystyrene [48] as well as sensitization of
penetration through cell membranes [49] should be obviously analyzed from this
viewpoint.
Polyradical character of the Si60 molecule is supported experimentally even more
ponderably. The first consequence provided by the phenomenon may be formulated
as a prohibition of the existence of particular chemical entities and even whole classes
such as alkenes, alkynes, aromatic compounds, and fullerenes, typical for its carbon
analogue. Only polyradicalization suppression can provide chemical stability that in
the latter case may be realized in form of the Si60H60 and Si60C60 species [9,10]. This
very high susceptibility of silicon atoms to polyradicalization provides as well
magnetism of its crystal surfaces [50] that has already become a physical reality
oppositely to the absence of similar effects for diamond crystal.
