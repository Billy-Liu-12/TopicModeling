Abstract. The paper presents a new method of the measure of the jitter in
telecommunication. Jitter is the phenomenon which is especially harmful to the
transmultiplexer systems, so its exact measure is very important to the system
engineer. Described scheme is based on the recognition and correlation of the
patterns generated by means of the wavelet transform. This research is a
continuation of the work on development of the wavelet based jitter
measurement methods that do not use the reference clock. Presented algorithm
allows to estimate the jitter parameters in relation to the jitter wavelet base
functions. Practical computer algorithm is also presented. Additionally, such
topics like the wavelet type, its order, as well as calibrating methods are also
discussed. This paper extends previous research and gives not only a proposal
but also implementation details.

1 Introduction
A jitter is an unwanted, spurious transmission clock phase modulation that originates
from the physics of semiconductor device [6][11].
Estimating the jitter of a transmission clock is an important problem in
telecommunication measurements, especially for the transmultiplexer systems. Each
transmultiplexer is time to a frequency-domain multiplexer and may be treated as a
discrete multitone modulator (DMT) [1]. It is common knowledge that DMT blocks
are fundamental for the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology so presented
solution seems to be interesting for DSL engineers and designers.
The classic approach to the jitter measurement analysis usually consists of
processing steps that use a reference clock [6][11][12]. The most troublesome part of
the measurement process is to correlate slopes of the reference and received clocks.
The purpose of this paper is to present a totally different wavelet based approach to
jitter measurement analysis as compared to the aforementioned methods. Presented
approach extends the research work which was presented during the ICWAA 2001
conference [5].

Jitter test equipment is used with an Equipment Under Test (EUT). Generated
test signals are transmitted over telecom line into the Equipment Under Test. The EUT
retransmits received data to the meter over a telecom line. Test equipment processes
all received information and calculates results [3][3].
In the classic approach, the implementation of the jitter meter requires on the
reference clock.

Mathematical Representation of Jitter

A jitter as an unwanted, spurious transmission clock phase modulation. This
phenomenon can be modeled using a modulation scheme, which allows us to describe
it with the multitone technique [3][10]. A case of single tone modulation can be
described as follows:

y (t ) = A ⋅ cos(2 ⋅ π ⋅ f clock ⋅ t + ϕ m (t )) ,

(1)

where y is the jittered clock signal with amplitude A [V] and base frequency fclock [Hz].
The phase modulating function ϕ m ( t ) can be described as follows:

ϕ m ( t ) = 2 ⋅ π ⋅ k sin⋅ ( 2 ⋅ π ⋅ f jitt ⋅ t )

(2)

where fjitt is jitter frequency [Hz], k≥0 ∧ k∈R the jitter amplitude in telecommunication
UI units (UI means Unit Interval which is equal to one cycle of transmission clock).
All calculations will be presented for the sine function which easily can be changed to
other wave shapes. Note that the sine waves after the comparator will be square wave
with 50% duty cycle – ideal clock signal [7][11][ 12].
A single tone modulated signal can be written as follows:

y PM ( t ) = A ⋅ cos( Ω ⋅ t + ∆Θ PM ⋅ sinϖ ⋅ t ) .

(3)

As shown in [10] this representation can be replaced by a more appropriate form that
makes use of the Bessel function:

y PM ( t ) = A ⋅

∞

∑ J n ( ∆Θ PM ) ⋅ cos( Ω + n ⋅ϖ ) ⋅ t ,

(4)

n = −∞

where Jn is an n-th order Bessel function of the first kind. In this case equations (1)
and (2) can be rewritten as follows:

y (t ) = A ⋅

∞

∑J

n

(2 ⋅ π ⋅ k ) ⋅ cos(Ω + n ⋅ ϖ j ) ⋅ t ,

n = −∞

where Ω = 2 ⋅ π ⋅ f clock and ϖ j = 2 ⋅ π ⋅ f jitt .

Preprocessing of the Jittered Signal

A jittered sine signal can be integrated by a circuit with a much higher cut-off
frequency than the maximum frequency in the input signal. In this case, the integrator
is a kind of an accumulator. A jittered signal given by (5) after the integration is equal
to:

y INT (t ) =

A
⋅
∆T

t + ∆T

∞

t

n = −∞

∫ ∑J

n

(2 ⋅ π ⋅ k ) ⋅ cos(Ω + n ⋅ ϖ j ) ⋅ t ,

(6)

where ∆T is the integration period. Because a direct analysis of (6) is somewhat
cumbersome, therefore some numerical computations were performed and are
presented in Fig. 1a, 1b. Numerical computations were performed for square waves as
well – sine waves after the comparator are presented in Fig. 1c, 1d. Note, that there is
no need for the reference clock for detection of jitter. This is a confirmation of the
presented here calculations [5].

4 Wavelet Transform Applied to Jitter Analysis
High quality jitter measurements involve measurements of an amplitude and
frequency of signals, as well as their change in time. In authors opinion, the best tool
for such an analysis is the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) [1][8] which is
represented by the following equation:
∞

C( s , p ) =

∫ f ( t ) ⋅Ψ ( s , p ,t )dt ,

(7)

−∞

where Ψ(s,p,t) is a mother wavelet, s the scale and p the position. Inserting (6) into (7)
provides us to the following formula:
∞

C ( s, p ) =

 A

t + ∆T



 


(8)

As can be observed in (8), there is no easy way to find a relationship between jitter
parameters and CWT coefficients for a signal after integration [9]. There are two
basic problems:
1) wavelet selection
2) finding correlation of wavelet coefficients C(s,p) with jitter parameters (i.e. its
amplitude and frequency).
The basic idea was to find other approach which allows to eliminate problems listed
above. Each calculation can be done in an absolute or a relative way. Due to the
troubles with the solution of the problem by the absolute way, we decide to investigate
the relative one. Our idea was to use jittered signal with well known jitter parameters
– called the “jitter base”. We try to find relation between any jittered signal and jitter
base and find unknown jitter parameters from the relation which has been found. Of
course linear one would be the best.

5

Relational Jitter Measurement

The new idea to jitter analysis is to employ relative measurements. We can relate the
two matrices A and B, by means of the following equation:

A⋅ r = B .

(9)

In real situations we rather attempt to solve for r in a sense of a minimization problem:

min ( B − A ⋅ r ) .

(10)

r

For the purpose of this paper we solve (10) by means of the least squares method. We
introduce a notation presented below:

Telecommunication Jitter Measurement in the Transmultipexer Systems Method

r = LSQR ( A, B ) ,

735

(11)

which means that r will be found with the least squares method.
In all of the following cases the matrix (vector) A will be called “the base” and
matrix (vector) B will be called “the test”. So in all measurements relation r will be
searched which allows to transform “base” space to the “test” space. A selection of
spaces will be discussed in the next sections. We have checked all possibilities of the
spaces generation (results are presented below), to show that our choice is not
accidental.
5.1 Relation between Integrated Jittered Signals
First attempt was to check relation between non transformed signals in a time domain
that are in the form of integrals (6). Due to this supposition, A will be a base vector
generated as an integrated jittered signal with known jitter parameters, and B will be a
test vector, for which relation r will be searched. Numerically calculated exemplary
relation r for the varying test vector is presented in Fig.2a. It can be seen that there is
no easy relation between r and changing jitter parameters, thus it is not clear how the
two spaces can be related.
5.2 Relation between CWT of the Jittered Signals
Due to a fail of the first method, the next attempt was made based on the observation
that if jitter parameters are changed, then jittered signal “changes scale”. It can be
observed also that increasing jitter amplitude results in something like a local
stretching of the signal. A similar conclusion may be drawn for situation with a
changing jitter frequency. In this case A will be a base matrix generated as an CWT
coefficients of the jittered signal with known jitter parameters, and B will be a test
matrix with CWT coefficients of the jitter function with the other parameters, for
which relation r will be searched. Numerically calculated exemplary relation r for the
varying test vector parameters is presented in Fig.2b. Results are not very promising,
like in the previous case.
5.3 Relation between CWT of the Integrated Jittered Signals
In this case the measure space was selected as the CWT of the integrated jittered
signal. It can be observed that in this case, increasing jitter amplitude results in
something like changing parameters of the standing wave. Similar conclusion may be
done for changing jitter frequency. In this case A will be a base matrix generated as an
CWT coefficients of the integrated jittered signal with known jitter parameters and B
will be a test matrix with CWT coefficients of the integrated jitter function with the
other parameters for which relation r will be searched. Numerically calculated

736

exemplary relation r for the varying test vector parameters is presented in Fig.2c. This
way obtained results are very interesting. Some linear relation may be observed
between the jitter parameters and the CWT jitter base. Detailed discussion of this
phenomenon will be presented in the next section.

Relational Jitter Measurement with Wavelet Base of the
Integrated Signal

6.1 Selection of the Wavelet Type
Due to discussion presented in previous sections and experiments which were
described in the ICWAA 2001 paper [5], bases with CWT of the integrated jitter
signal with different wavelet types were checked.

The following wavelets were tested:
• Mexican Hat,
• Morlet,
• Coiflets 2-5,
• Biorthogonal 2.6 2.8 4.4 5.5 6.8,
because their shapes appeared to be the most appropriate to analyze the signals shown
in Fig.4b and Fig.4c (see section 4.1.). Exemplary results are presented only for the
Biorthogonal 4.4, Morlet and Mexican Hat – see Fig.3.

CWT of the integrated jitter space – Morlet wavelet, c) relation r for the varying jitter
parameters and for the CWT of the integrated jitter signal – Mexican Hat wavelet (100Hz,
0.25UI), d) Relation r for the varying jitter parameters and for the CWT of the integrated jitter
signal – Mexican Hat wavelet (50Hz, 1UI)

Only the Mexican Hat wavelet gives almost linear relation, when in other cases
parabolic or other relations were obtained. Thus, there is a first important remark that
a wavelet type used in base function is significant and decides about type of relation.

738

J. Borgosz and B. Cyganek

Presented results show that the Mexican Hat wavelet gives the best results, due to
nearly linear characteristic of r. Set of the numerical tests were done which confirmed
our observations.
Figure 4 depicts relation r in the 2D-style plot. It may be observed that relation r
may be described by the classic linear equation (y=ax+b), where parameters a and b
depend on jitter frequency – this can be written as follows:

r = a ( f jitt ) ⋅ A jitt + b( f jitt ) .

(12)

6.2 Relation between CWT of the Integrated Jittered Signals – Analytic Analysis
Results obtained by means of the numerical analysis may be verified by the analytic
relations. Let us assume that:
∞

C ( s, p ) =

∫ f (t ) ⋅ Ψ( s, p, t )dt = CWT ( f (t ), Ψ) .

−∞

(13)

Telecommunication Jitter Measurement in the Transmultipexer Systems Method

739

The relation r may be rewritten as follows:

r = LSQR (CWT ( y INT (t ), Ψ ), CWT ( y BASE _ INT (t ), Ψ ) ) ,

(14)

where:

y INT (t ) =

y BASE _ INT (t ) =

7 Conclusions
In this paper we conclude that a jitter measurement may be realized as calculation of
the relation between CWT coefficients of integrated jittered signals and CWT
coefficients of a base jitter signal.
This method provides a novel way of jitter measurement without usage of the
reference clock. An introduction to the analytic description of the method was
presented. Different types of wavelets were analyzed in a context of their application
to the presented method. However, only wavelets with the Mexican Hat mother
functions produce sought linear results.
There are still subjects that need further investigation, however. These are:
• detailed analytic solution of the problem,
• analytic solution including wavelet type,
• detailed analysis of the range of jitter parameters change.
Presented solution due to its innovatively may be very interesting for the modern
telecommunication business associated with DSL and transmultiplexer techniques,
which has to look for the new techniques which allow to use cheap hardware resources
(like twisted-pair telephone lines) to deliver modern multimedia to the client.
