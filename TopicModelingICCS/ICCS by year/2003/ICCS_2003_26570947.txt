Abstract. The Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid dynamics is used
to compute the drag force on various types of obstacles in two-dimensional
flows. We study the finite size effects for the drag force on a cylinder and
propose a scaling law. Then we consider the hydrodynamic behavior of
fractal objects and compare the drag force they experience with that of
simpler geometries. Simulation results show that, in 2D, the outer shape
of the fractal plays the main role to determine the drag whereas the
internal structure has little influence.

Introduction

Hydrodynamic properties of fractal aggregates have attracted attention of scientists for several decades. Investigations of the hydrodynamic properties of fractals
are related to many aspects, from theoretical analysis of fractal aggregates suspended in viscous fluid to analytical and numerical approximations of Stokes’
equation and transport properties in sedimentation, filtration and electrophoresis processes. Literature in this field is mainly concentrated on the calculation of
the drag force FD acting on fractals in viscous fluid, determination of the settling
velocities V , hydrodynamic radius Rh of fractals . . . and their connections to
fluid viscosity µ, fractal dimension Df and other relevant factors.
In early researches, the Kirkwood Riseman theory that describes drag force
on the elementary particles of a fractal in fluid by using interaction tensors between mutual interactions was used [1]. Using this approach P. Meakin [2], W.
Hess, H.L. Frisch [3] investigated the ratio of the hydrodynamic radius to the
gyration radius of fractal aggregates Rh /Rg . Other researches from P. Adler [4],
B.Cichocki [5] concentrated on the determination of the drag force exerted by
the surrounding fluid on a translating aggregate by numerically solving Stokes
equation. However, very few work have been done for determining drag using
numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, there are two contributions
to this aspect, one is from P.Adler by solving Stokes equation using finite elements method [6] and the other is from A. Adrover and A.Giona using Lattice
Boltzmann method [7].

The paper is organized as follow: first, we briefly discuss the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for simulation of fluid dynamics. Then the fluid motion past
a cylinder is investigated in terms of channel width and discretization effects.
Finally, the drag force exerted on a 2D fractal aggregate and fluid velocity is
investigated and the relationship between the fluid velocity and drag force established.

Lattice Boltzmann Approach for Numerical Simulation
of Fluid Flow

Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models are rather new numerical techniques aimed at
modeling a physical system in terms of the dynamics of fictitious particles [8, 9].
The main idea of this approach is to model the physical reality at a mesoscopic
level: the generic features of microscopic processes can be expressed through
simple rules, from which the desired macroscopic behavior emerges as a collective
effect of the interactions between the many elementary components. In a LB
model, the fluid is described by density distribution functions fi (r, t) giving the
probability that a fictitious fluid particle with velocity vi enters the lattice site
r at discrete time t. The admissible velocities vi are dependent on the lattice
topology. Usually, i runs between 0 and z, where z is the lattice coordination
number (i.e. the number of lattice links). By convention v0 = 0 and f0 represents
the density distribution of particles at rest. The fluid density ρ(r, t) and fluid
velocity u(r, t) are defined as

where ∆t is the time step of the simulation, τ the so-called relaxation time

distribution. They depend only on the fluid density ρ and fluid velocity u in
a suitable way. It can be shown (see for instance [9, 8, 10]) that equation (2)
reproduces a hydrodynamical behavior if the local equilibrium functions are
chosen as follows (Greek indices label the spatial coordinates and we use the

where the coefficients ti are weights associated with the lattice direction, cs is
the speed of sound and v the lattice speed, i.e. v = ∆r/∆t with ∆r the lattice
spacing.
Here we use the so-called D2Q9 topology, i.e. a two dimensional square lattice with 9 velocity vectors: directions i = 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to the nearest
neighbors and directions i = 5, 6, 7, 8 to the neighbors along the diagonals). For
this topology, we take c2s = 1/3 and it is found that the lattice weights are
t0 = 4/9, t1,2,3,4 = 1/9 and t5,6,7,8 = 1/36

3 Simulation of Fluid Flow Past an Impermeable Cylinder
The main goal of this paper is to compute the drag force FD experienced by a
fractal aggregate immersed in a fluid flowing at speed u0 . We are interested in
small Reynolds number regime.
Before we consider this problem, we first revisit a simpler situation, namely
the drag force on a cylinder. This is a classical experiment in fluid hydrodynamics. Usually the experimental data give the drag force on a cylinder placed in
a system that can be assumed infinite. However, in a numerical simulation, one
has to take into account the fact that the computational domain has a finite
size and also pay attention to the imperfect discretization of the cylinder on the
lattice used for the computation. As these effects will also play a role for the
fractal aggregates we want to control them for the cylinder.
We consider a simulation on a periodic lattice of size Nx × Ny . Since the
model is 2D, the cylinder is represented by a disk of diameter d, centered at
position (Nx /2, Ny /2). The so-called full-way bounce back rule is applied on
the surface of the cylinder, that is, upon collision with the obstacle, the fluid
particles simply reverse their direction of motion.
The bounce back rule is particularly easy to implement but it does not ensure
a perfect no-slip boundary condition. A way to guarantee a zero velocity on the
surface of the obstacle is to use the recently developed mass conserving boundary
condition [12] [11].
In our experiments, we accelerate the fluid with a body force F = (G, 0). In
the stationary regime, the amount of momentum injected in the system by this
body force should be equal to the momentum adsorbed by the cylinder. The
latter is precisely the drag force FD . Thus, we must have
FG =

2fi (rs )vi = FD
rs

i

where FG is total body force added to the system per time step and rs designate
the sites on the cylinder surface. This relation is illustrated in figure 1.

Fig. 1. Development of total drag force on cylinder with an applied body force. We see
that in the stationary regime the drag force is equal to the total body force.

Therefore, by applying a body force, one controls the drag force and not the
fluid velocity u0 . This velocity u0 should be measured from the simulation. We
choose to take the value at location (Nx , Ny /2).
Note that instead of a body force, we could have accelerated the fluid by
imposing a velocity profile with ux (r) = u0 at the inlet of the channel. Then
the fluid velocity would be the control parameter and the drag force would be
measured as the momentum adsorbed per time step at the cylinder surface. We
found the second method numerically less accurate.
3.1

Effect of the Channel Width

In this section we analyze the behavior of the drag coefficient CD as a function
of the Reynolds number of the flow. We consider various channel width L and
compare the results of our numerical simulation with the experimental data of
Tritton [13]. In this simulation the cylinder radius is always of 8 sites, and the
channel length is Nx = Ny = L/∆r, where ∆r is lattice spacing.
Conventionally, the drag coefficient for a cylindrical obstacle is defined as [14]
CD =

where d is the cylinder diameter and u0 is the fluid velocity.
The drag coefficient is often expressed in terms of the Reynolds number
Re =

with µ the dynamic viscosity.
It is usually assumed that the relation between Re and CD is
Cd = aRe−b

(10)

Lattice Boltzmann Method to Study Hydrodynamic Properties

951

where a and b are constants empirically determined. For a cylinder and for small
Re regimes the value of b is found smaller than 1. The experimental data from
Tritton [13] are plotted in a log-log scale in figure 2. We also show the drag
coefficients measured in the LB simulations for different channel widths L = 60,
100, 140, 180, 220 but the same cylinder radius d/2 = 8. We see that relation (10)
is well obeyed but that the values of a and b depend on L.

Tritton’s data correspond to an infinitely large channel and are slowly approached by the simulation as L → ∞. In order to quantify how the drag coefficient in a finite system converges to that of the infinite system, we plot the
coefficient log a(L) and b(L) as a function of 1/L.
Figure 3 (left) shows that the vertical offset log a(L) varies linearly with 1/L
and that the limit for L → ∞ is 2.3534, very much in agreement with the the
vertical offset 2.3868 of Tritton’s data. A similar fit can be done for b(L), though

(11)

This rather slow convergence is due to the fact that, at low Reynolds number,
the influence of the obstacle on the flow is visible even far away.
3.2

Discretization Effect

In the simulation, the cylinder is discretized on the lattice. Therefore its shape
is not perfectly circular. However, the bigger the radius the smaller the errors.
Here we study how the drag coefficient is sensitive to the discretization errors.
We consider several simulations in which we increase in the same ratio both the
diameter d of the cylinder and the system size L. The scaling factors we use are
0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2. For each of them we compute the drag coefficient at Re = 1
The results are shown in figure 3 (right). We observe that when the radius is
above 16 lattice site, the drag coefficient stabilizes. Between the value for d/2 = 8
and d/2 > 16, there is an error of about 10%.
3.3

Drag as a Function of the Volume Fraction

The situation of an infinite array of cylinders subject to a flow at speed u0 has
been investigated by Sangani and Acrivos [15]. A semi-analytical solution connecting the drag, fluid velocity and solid volume fraction has been proposed. This
situation corresponds exactly to our numerical simulation, since our boundary
conditions are periodic. The relation considered in [15] is the following
FD
=
µU

1
4π/{ln(c−1/2 ) − 0.738 + c − 0.887c2 + 2.038c3} if c
√
1/2 −5/2
c
9π/2 2{1 − ( cmax ) }
cmax − c

1 (12)

where FD is total drag, µ is dynamic viscosity of fluid and U is known as the
average velocity of flow. The quantity c is the solid volume fraction (i.e the ratio
of the cylinders area to the system area) and cmax is volume fraction obtained
when the cylinders are large enough to touch each other.
Figure 4 compares the above theoretical expression (solid line) with our numerical simulations (circles and squares). Whereas the agreement is good in the
limit of small c, the numerical experiment departs from the behavior predicted
by eq. (12). This discrepancy is not due to the slip velocity resulting from the
bounce back rule since the mass conserving boundary condition does not change
the result in a significant way.
A reason that can yet explain this difference of behavior is the definition of
U . This average velocity is not precisely defined in [15]. In our simulation we
2
computed it as U =
r ux (r)/L . In the figure, we also show the curves we
obtain if U is taken as the minimal or maximal velocity in the fluid. Clearly
both the numerical and analytical results lie within these two extreme limits.

Hydrodynamic Properties of Fractal Aggregates in 2D

In this section we consider a fractal obstacle in the flow instead of a cylinder.
We want to investigate the effect of the fractal geometry on the drag force.

The observed discrepancy is not yet understood.

In our simulations, fractal aggregates are composed of many elementary particles located on the lattice sites. They are obtained by simulating a lattice DLA
(diffusion limited aggregation) process.
In the preliminary experiments described in this paper, we consider rather
small fractal objects, i.e. aggregates having 100 or 200 particles. For the sake of
simplicity, we also assume that the particles making up the fractal are point-like
and occupy only one lattice site. Figure 5 shows the 100-particle fractal and its
effect on the velocity of fluid. We proceed our investigations by comparing the
drag force experienced by the aggregate as a function of its orientation with the
main flow. We consider only four orientations, namely the reference position,
and the rotation by π/2, π and 3π/2.
As before, we impose the drag force FD on the system by applying a body
force on the fluid and we measure the resulting average flow velocity u (which
is computed by averaging velocity over all fluid sites) of the flow in the system.
Figure 6 (left) shows that the relation between FD and u is linear, as expected
from Stokes law, but that the proportionality coefficient FD /u depends on the
orientation of the fractal object. In addition, we observe that the behavior is the
same whether the object is rotated by 180o or not.
These results could suggest that the hydrodynamic resistance of the fractal
object to the fluid motion mostly depends on its cross section orthogonal to the
flow direction.

However, as shown in figure 6 (right) results from simulations with a plate
orthogonal to the flow direction and having the same width as the projection of
the fractal aggregate do not show the same behavior. A plate offers less resistance
to the flow than the fractal object. This is due to the fact that the length of
the obstacle along the flow direction also plays a role, yet to a lesser extent
than the perpendicular extension. Therefore, we also compare the drag force on
rectangular objects having the same length and width as the fractal object. The
plots shown in figure 6 (right) indicate that the rectangle now over-estimate the
drag force.
Nevertheless, it clearly appears from the simulation that the speed of the
fluid inside the aggregate is almost zero. Therefore, in 2D, the hydrodynamic
properties of a fractal object are mostly determined by its outer shape and not
distribution of particles inside the fractal. We believe that, in 2D, the convex
hull of the fractal object would give a good approximation of the hydrodynamic
behavior. This observation is also consistent with the results by A.Adrover and
M.Giona [7].

For 3D fractal objects, hydrodynamic properties are often described in terms
of the hydrodynamic radius Rh = FD /(6πµu0 ) and the relation it bears with the
gyration radius Rg 2 = (1/N ) i (ri − rcm )2 , where N is the number of particles
in the aggregate, ri their location and rcm , the center of mass of the object.
In 2D, the radius of gyration can be computed in the same way as in 3D. The
hydrodynamic radius is given by the radius of a cylinder experiencing the same
drag force in a flow with the same speed. From the simulation, we search for the
radius Rh of a cylinder offering the same resistance as the fractal. This value Rh
may depend on the chosen orientation of the fractal. For the 0-rotated and π/2rotated orientation of the 100-particle fractal, we find Rh /Rg 1.288 and 1.675
respectively.
Finally, we consider another DLA fractal object with 200 particles and much
more isotropic than the one in figure 5. In figure 7 we see that for all the four
considered orientations, the FD − u relation is the same. It also corresponds
rather well to the drag on the cylinder which circumscribes the aggregate. On
the other hand, a cylinder whose radius is equal to the gyration radius of the
fractal experiences a drag force significantly too small.

Conclusion

The Lattice Boltzmann method is a powerful approach for modeling flow and
transport at intermediate scales where neither continuum models nor molecular
dynamics methods are practical. We have considered this approach to study, for
small Reynolds number flows, the drag force acting on a cylinder and on fractal
aggregates.
In the case of the cylinder we have been able to estimate the finite size
corrections by deriving a scaling law for the drag coefficient as a function of the
Reynolds number and system size. We also studied the discretization effect of

956

H.P. Nguyen, B. Chopard, and S. Stoll

the cylinder on the lattice and we found that, for a radius larger than 16 sites,
the error is small.
In the case of a fractal aggregate, we studied the drag force for various orientation with respect to the flow direction. We can conclude from the simulation
that the outer shape of the aggregate is the main factor determining the hydrodynamic properties in 2D. The internal structure plays an almost irrelevant role
as the fluid is at rest inside the fractal. Thus we do not observe a relation between the fractal dimension and the hydrodynamic radius. This result has never
been clearly reported in previous studies. In 3D, however we expect another behavior as the porosity of the aggregate will be crucial. This will be studied in a
forthcoming paper.
