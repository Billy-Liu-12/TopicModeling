Abstract. The authors introduce some further research on the problem depicted
in [1]. The transient model has been worked out to check how rapidly the
temperature of the chip changes when the applied power changes abruptly This
means searching for the answer: how the thermal resistance and the maximum
temperature vary versus time. The simulations required using the 3-D thermal
model of considered system that was used in numerical simulations and next,
tested with commercial software, ANSYS 5.7 based on Finite Element Method
(FEM) and additional calculations.

1 Introduction
The temperature rise above the permissible level results in much worse work of the
device or even in its destruction. Enlarging frequency and the requested speed of
switching make the conditions more difficult yet. The work introduces our results of
dynamic simulations performed for the system: 2 MOSFETs on IPM, described in [1].
The 3-D thermal model of IPM used in the simulations is discussed there. In the
model, it has been assumed that the silicon chip is the only heat source in which the
heat is dissipated homogeneously. The magnitude of heat dissipation has been fixed
on the base of Toshiba transistor 2SK2866a data sheet [2]. Taking into account its
catalogue maximum ratings, so called the PD drain power dissipation has been chosen
as equal to125W, which gives the heat generation of 18.1e9 W/m3 when taking into
account the volume of the silicon chip.

2 The Thermal Model of IPM
The thermal model used for transient simulations is similar to the one described in
[1]. It covers one half of the examined structure, introduced in Fig. 1 and its basic
parameters are collected in Table 1. The structure above was the basis to work out the
procedure in Ansys software that made possible the dynamic simulations of the heat
flow inside the considered IPM module, for the step heat load function.

3 The Dynamic Simulations
The simulation has been performed for the step function of power dissipation. Its
magnitude has been assumed as equaled to the value of 18.1 e9 W/m3, what meets
125W heat source in the silicon chip. The Figures 2-5 compose an example of one
typical series of the temperature development to show the changes during heating
since the step start till the thermal equilibrium state is reached. We have kept the same
scale of temperature for the diagrams to make possible easy comparing.

Fig. 5. The cross-section of the structure. Temperature after 100 s of heating

The last figure (after 100 s of heating) gives the steady-state conditions. The
temperature does not change any more, having achieved its maximum of 1230C.
The thermal maps from figs. 2-5 permit to estimate the changes of the
maximum temperature in the IPM structure that occurs on the top surface of the
silicon chip, and the thermal impedance of the module that corresponds to them. Such
dependencies have been estimated for different dimensions of Cu foil. The fig. 6 gives
the maximum temperature, which is captured on the hottest place, and the fig. 7
thermal impedance curves for the whole structure. One can see that the curves for Cu
width 4.0mm coincide the ones for Cu on whole the surface, so the conditions are
steady-state with this value.

4 The Estimation of the RC Ladder
The simulations for the input step function were run to calculate the heat properties
for the considered package. The final numbers have been evaluated for dynamic
thermal models, covering thermal resistances (Rth ) and capacitances (Cth). Fig. 8
shows the scheme of such a RC ladder, and Table 2 introduces the values, calculated
for enlarging Cu width values. With them one can calculate the thermal conditions for
any boundary conditions and schemes, where the tested package is applied.
The values are calculated versus time (t) according to the formula (1) [4]:

where n=5 for our simulations, and

τ thi = Rthi ⋅ Cthi

The RC network (ladder) model is five-stages (Fig. 8), what allows us to exam which
part of the structure changes and which one can be even neglected. The results proved
that the two end stages (IMS) give the significant impact to the curve shape, i.e. to the
thermal capacitance.

5 Conclusions
The 3D simulations presented here allow for the sight into the thermal processes
taking part in the considered IPM module. They make possible estimating the
maximum temperature inside the examined structure that can be used for the thermal
impedance evaluation. The obtained curve has been applied to determine the lumped
thermal model of the module in the form of the RC ladder.
