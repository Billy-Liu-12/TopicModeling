Abstract. In this paper we review some applications of generalized
polynomial chaos expansion for uncertainty quantification. The mathematical framework is presented and the convergence of the method is
demonstrated for model problems. In particular, we solve the first-order
and second-order ordinary differential equations with random parameters, and examine the efficiency of generalized polynomial chaos compared to Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the generalized polynomial chaos can be orders of magnitude more efficient than Monte Carlo
simulations when the dimensionality of random input is low, e.g. for correlated noise.

Introduction

The generalized polynomial chaos, also called the Wiener-Askey polynomial
chaos, was first proposed in [6] for solving stochastic differential equations. It
is a generalization of the classical Wiener’s polynomial chaos, which is defined
as the span of Hermite polynomial functionals of a Gaussian process [4]. The
Hermite-chaos expansion converges to any L2 functional in the L2 sense, according to the Cameron-Martin theorem [1]. It has been a useful tool in the study
of multiple Itˆ
o integrals. In recent years, the Wiener’s Hermite-chaos has been
applied to the stochastic modeling of engineering applications, including various
problems in mechanics [2, 3]. The more general framework of polynomial chaos
employs many classes of orthogonal polynomials, and includes the Hermite-chaos
as a subset. The main advantage of the generalized polynomial chaos is that it
can represent many non-Gaussian stochastic processes, including some discrete
processes, more efficiently [5–8].
In this paper, we review the theory and application of generalized polynomial
chaos, and evaluate its performance by solving stochastic ordinary differential
equations.

The Generalized Polynomial Chaos

The generalized polynomial chaos is a means of representing second-order stochastic processes X(ω), viewed as a function of ω (the random event)

where Ψn (ξi1 , . . . , ξin ) denotes the generalized polynomial chaos of order n in the
variables (ξi1 , . . . , ξin ), and are orthogonal polynomials in terms of the multidimensional random variables ξ = (ξi1 , . . . , ξin ). For notational convenience, one
can re-arrange the terms in equation (1), according to some numbering scheme,
and rewrite the expansion as

X(ω) =

where there is a one-to-one correspondence between the functions Ψn (ξi1 , . . . , ξin )
and Φj (ξ), and their corresponding coefficients ai1 i2 i3 ... and a
ˆj . Again {Φj (ξ)} are
the (multi-dimensional) orthogonal polynomials in terms of the multi-dimensional
random vector ξ, satisfying the orthogonality relation
Φi , Φj = Φ2i δij ,

(3)

where δij is the Kronecker delta and ·, · denotes the ensemble average. This is
the inner product in the Hilbert space determined by the support of the random
variables
(4)
f (ξ), g(ξ) = f (ξ)g(ξ)w(ξ)dξ
with w(ξ) denoting the weighting function. In the discrete case, the above orthogonal relation takes the form
f (ξ)g(ξ)w(ξ).

f (ξ), g(ξ) =

(5)

ξ

In (2), there is a one-to-one correspondence between the type of the orthogonal polynomials {Φ} and the type of the random variables ξ. This is determined by choosing the type of orthogonal polynomials {Φ} in such a way that

348

D. Xiu et al.

their weighting function w(ξ) in the orthogonality relation (4) has the same
form as the probability distribution function of the underlying random variables ξ. For example, the weighting function of Hermite orthogonal polynomials
is √ 1 n exp(− 12 ξ T ξ), and is the same as the probability density function of
(2π)

the n−dimensional Gaussian random variables ξ. Hence, the classical Wiener
polynomial chaos is an expansion of Hermite polynomials in terms of Gaussian
random variables. Some types of generalized polynomial chaos corresponding to
the commonly known distributions are listed in table 1.

The expansion (1) (or (2)) resides in the infinite dimensional space determined by ξ, and is an infinite summation. In practice, we have to restrict ourselves to the finite-term summation. This is achieved by reducing the expansion
to the finite-dimensional space, i.e. expansion of finite-dimensional random variables ξ, according to the nature of random inputs; we also set the highest order
of the polynomials {Φ} according to accuracy requirement. The finite-term expansion takes the form

{Φ} is m, then the total number of expansion terms (M + 1) is, (M + 1) =
(n + m)!/(n!m!).

Applications to Stochastic ODEs

In this section we apply the generalized polynomial chaos to the solution of
stochastic ordinary differential equations with random parameters. We first consider the first-order ODE and demonstrate in detail the solution procedure; we
then consider a second-order ODE with multiple random parameters which results in multi-dimensional polynomial chaos expansion. Hereafter, we restrict
our discussion to the continuous probability distributions.

We consider the ordinary differential equation

y(0) = yˆ,

where the decay rate coefficient k is considered to be a random variable k(ω) with
certain probability density function (PDF) f (k), zero mean value and standard

We then project the above equation onto the random space spanned by the
orthogonal polynomial basis {Φi } by taking the inner product of the equation
with each basis. By taking < ., Φl > and utilizing the orthogonality condition

In Figure 1 we show the error convergence at time t = 1 of the Hermitechaos expansion and Jacobi-chaos expansion, subject to Gaussian input and
beta input, respectively. It can be seen on the semi-log plot that the errors
decay exponentially fast as the highest order of expansion (P ) increases. Given
the simplicity of the equation, we can estimate the solution error of the finiteterm chaos expansion. In particular, we estimate analytically the relative error
in variance, denoted 2 (t), for different distributions of k as a function of time

analytical formula is available and the estimation has to be evaluated numerically. By using these error estimates, we examine the number of expansion terms
needed for a given error control threshold. The results of Hermite-chaos with
Gaussian input and Legendre-chaos with uniform input are plotted in Figure 2,
for fixed relative error of 10−7 in variance. It can be seen that the number of
Hermite-chaos needed is larger than Legendre-chaos, and grows faster over time.
For details of these estimates, see [9].

Second-Order ODE

In this section, we consider a linear oscillator subject to both random parametric
and external forcing excitations, in the form

where ξ1 , ξ2 and ξ3 are three independent random variables with zero mean; σc ,
σk and σF scales as the standard deviations of c, k and F , respectively. Here
we will consider the uniform and Gaussian distributions. Correspondingly, the
Legendre-chaos and Hermite-chaos will be employed.
The numerical integration is performed up to T = 100 when the solution
reaches the asymptotic periodic state. We examine the convergence of the relative
error in mean and variance at the final time versus the expansion order(see figure
3). It can be seen that the errors of the mean and variance decrease exponentially
fast as the expansion order increases. However, in the Legendre-chaos the error in
the mean and variance decay at the same rate in contrast to the Hermite-chaos.

Efficiency

The expanded equations from generalized polynomial chaos is a set of coupled
equations, with each one of them resembles the deterministic equation. Since
these equations are solved explicitly, the overall computational cost of generalized polynomial expansion is roughly the number of expansion terms times
the cost of a single deterministic solution. On the other hand, the cost of Monte
Carlo simulations is the number of realizations times that of a deterministic solution. Normally, thousands of realizations are needed for Monte Carlo simulation
to obtain the solution statistics with moderate accuracy. Thus, the generalized

polynomial chaos offers a great potential of computational speed-up due to its
fast convergence rate.
For example, if k is an exponentially distributed random variable in the firstorder ODE problem discussed in 3.1, the error convergence of the mean solution
of the Monte-Carlo simulation and the corresponding Laguerre-chaos is shown
in table 2.

For the second-order linear oscillator (13), we examine the efficiency of generalized polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo simulation by fixing the error requirement in mean at T = 100. Both uniform random inputs and Gaussian random
inputs are considered, and the results are summarized in table 3. Smaller speedup factors are observed for the Hermite-chaos expansion with Gaussian inputs,

compared with Legendre-chaos with uniform inputs. The advantage of the exponential convergence of chaos expansion is obvious, especially when smaller
errors are required. In the case of uniform random input with error requirement
of 0.001% in mean, a speed-up factor of 17 millions is observed for Legendrechaos expansion.

Conclusion

The efficiency of the generalized polynomial chaos can be orders of magnitude
higher than the methods that require sampling, e.g. Monte Carlo method. This
is especially obvious when the random inputs have low to moderate dimensions.
However, if the random input has large dimensions, i.e. in the limit of white
noise, the cost of generalized polynomial chaos grows fast, for a large number
of expansion terms is required. In this case, the efficiency of the generalized
polynomial chaos expansion is reduced drastically and the Monte Carlo method
may be more efficient. This is still an unresolved problem for the generalized
polynomial chaos and more work is required to resolve this issue.
