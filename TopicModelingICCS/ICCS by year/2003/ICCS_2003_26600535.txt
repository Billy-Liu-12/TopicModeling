Abstract. With recent advances in wireless communication technology, mobile
computing is an importance research area. Mobile IP is designed to provide IP
services to roaming nodes. Mobile users take advantage of this protocol to obtain the services as if they were connected to their home network. In many cases
mobile users is connected through a wireless link and is protected by corporation’s firewall in virtual private network. In order to have a successful deployment of Mobile IP as an extension of a private network, security services should
be provided as if the mobile node were attached to its home network. In this paper, we propose the security mechanism of combining Mobile IP and IPSec tunnels, which can provide secure traversal of firewall in a home network. The
simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides the secure and
efficient communication.

1 Introduction
Mobility in IP networks is a significant issue due to the recent increase of many portable devices such as notebook and PDA and the development of wireless network
interface. Many popular applications such as E-commerce and remote access require
transmission of highly sensitive information, often over wireless links. Mobility implies higher security risk than static operation in fixed network, because the traffic
may at times take unexpected network paths with unknown or unpredictable security
characteristics. Technologies should be developed both IP security and mobility over
wireless links.
Mobile IP has been designed with the IETF [1] to provide robust communication of
mobile users as they roam from place to place [2][3][4]. With growth of public networks and the deployment of security protocols, enterprises around the world are
trying to securely extend their network over the public backbones, establishing what
are called Virtual Private Network (VPN). Practical applications of Mobile IP are
likely to occur where a private network is extended over Internet. In many cases mobile users is connected through a wireless link and is protected by corporation’s
firewall in VPN. In order to have a successful deployment of Mobile IP as an extension of a private network, mobile users must be authenticated safely when roaming

from own network to another and only authorized users must be allowed the access to
the private network. In Mobile IP, a tunnel is built up from a Home Agent (HA) to the
Mobile Node’s (MN’s) Care-of-Address (CoA). Since this tunnel can be traverse the
home network’s firewall, the tunnel endpoints have to be administrated carefully with
regard to security. Network operators are not likely to accept any tunnels through their
firewalls. Additionally, the firewall has to inspect both outer and inner header of tunneled packets to ensure the packets are delivered only if their exact destination address
is the home address of a registered MN, which may cause efficient problems. Since an
MN abroad is logically still a part of its home network, security associations providing
at least data origin authentication are necessary between each MN and a HA or a
firewall in home network. Data encryption is required to keep confidential data transmitted to the MN as secure as it would be inside the home network. Another problem
regarding Mobile IP and firewall is the use of topologically incorrect source addresses
for packets sent by an MN. Few firewalls will allow such packets to exit a foreign
network or to enter the MN’s home network if the destination address is located there.
The IETF has also developed the suite of IPSec protocols [5] to provide capabilities
to secure communications across the Internet at the network layer. With IPSec, security mechanisms are directly applied to IP packets. Additional headers are added to an
IP packet to transport security related information and to identify protected packets.
In this paper we propose the secure tunneling mechanism of combining Mobile IP
and IPSec tunnels, which can provide secure traversal of firewall in home network
while mobile nodes are roaming abroad. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the existing proposal for firewall over Mobile IP. Section 3 describes the
our proposed mechanism. Section 4 presents our simulation environment and simulation scenarios and evaluates the simulation result. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and
concludes this paper.

2 Related Works
Zao and Condell [8] describe the scheme to negotiate the use of IPSec on the Mobile
IP tunnels and a procedure to establish these tunnels. IPSec is used to replace IP-in-IP
tunneling, which is basic tunneling mechanism in Mobile IP. They defined the six
possible unidirectional tunnels(HA-MN, HA-FA, MN-FA, and vice versa). The tunnel
establishment has to be done by an appropriate protocol such as ISAKMP. The approach is required minimal overhead, but it is quite inflexible.
Binkley and Ricardson [9] propose a security model using IPSec for mobile user
and networks providing access-points to these mobile nodes. They propose the bidirectional IPSec tunnels between a HA and a MN. Since they consider secure mobility problem as special case of ad-hoc network, it may be too complex in Mobile IP
network.
Montenegro and Gupta [10] describe the scheme of combining Mobile IP and IPSec tunnels which can protect the home network when mobile nodes are roaming
abroad. They propose to use SKIP for key management, authentication, and encryp-

tion. The approach seems to be easy and efficient to solve Mobile IP security problem,
but all mobile nodes must support SKIP.
Mink et al. [11][12], propose the hierarchical mobility architecture FATIMA
(Firewall-Aware Transparent Internet Mobility Architecture). In order to achieve the
security, they define a special gateway in firewall and IPSec tunnels are established
among those nodes. The approach is transparent to current Mobile IP and supports the
micro-mobility. However, since all security-critical functionality is concentrated in
FATIMA gateway, it causes a single point of failure. Moreover, the high cost in design and implementation of the architecture is additional disadvantages.

3 Proposed Secure Tunneling Mechanism
3.1 Secure Tunneling Mechanism
We describe the proposed secure tunneling mechanism. To simplify the security management we regard the firewall as screen-subnet firewall, where the private network
and Internet are separated by de-militarized zone. Signaling between the mobile node
and the firewall requires message authentication, integrity and replay protection, while
mobile nodes roam foreign networks. We use an IPSec tunnel to protect the Mobile IP
tunnel between firewall and MN, which traverse the insecure parts of the Internet,
similar to the proposal by Montenegro and Gupta. Since all packets over the Internet
are authenticated and encrypted by IPSec, the establishment of IPSec tunnel is able to
implement a lightweight security in Mobile IP without additional security mechanism.
Within the private network, we use the Mobile IP tunnel. Therefore, the traffic between HA and firewall is sent through IP-in-IP tunneling. The proposed tunneling
mechanism provides authentication, integrity and replay protection of all IP packets
sent during Mobile IP registration. Fig. 1 shows the proposed secure tunneling mechanism.

We assume that MNs acquire their IP address from Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) [13] servers while MN is roaming abroad. DHCP allows to dynamically
assign an IP address to a node and is a wide spread mechanism to reduce the administration overhead in dynamic changing network configuration. As regarding to the

538

practical implementation, the combination of Mobile IP with DHCP is used. Data
transmission between the MN and the Correspondent Node(CN) takes place via the
HA because of security reasons. It is also possible to communicate with the CN directly provided no security is needed. The encrypted and encapsulated Mobile IP
packets are decrypted and decapsulated by the firewall and delivered to the HA. The
HA finally decapsulates these Mobile IP packets and delivers them to the appropriate
receivers.
3.2 Operation of Secure Tunneling Mechanism
When a MN moves new point of attachment, proposed tunneling mechanism operates
as follows. When a MN enters new foreign network, the MN stops the old IPSec tunnels. The MN gets the co-located CoA from DHCP servers. Thereafter, bi-directional
IPSec tunnel establishes between MN and firewall. Then, the MN registers at the HA
and communicate with other CN. Fig. 2 shows the exchange of messages of proposed
secure tunneling mechanism by time sequence.

4 Performance Evaluation
4.1 Simulation Environment
We analyze the performance of proposed mechanism through the simulation. In the
following, we describe the four types of scenario for simulation and present the simulation results. Each scenario is simulated on Desktop PC with Intel Pentium IV 1G Hz
CPU and run under Windows 2000 server operation system. In our simulation, we use
the SDL(Specification and Description Language) which is standardized as ITU Recommendation Z.100. Because of SDL’s suitability for real-time and stimuli-response

systems, it is well received in the telecommunication community and is used both in
standards making and product development.
Fig. 3 shows our simulation network topology. In the simulation topology, the
wired link bandwidth is 10 Mbps with 5 ms/km latency. The wireless side has 2 Mbps
with 7 ms/km latency.

Assumptions. We use the pre-established symmetric keys to eliminate the necessity of
using asymmetric cryptography which represent more processing overhead for the
system. We decide to use pre-negotiated security attributes between the HA and the
MN and between the firewall and the MN for Mobile IP registration. Since all the
security protocols simulated give various alternatives in terms of algorithms for the
different security attributes, we have to decide the appropriate algorithms. For this
purpose, we consider several aspects such as algorithm that have proven enough
reliability, algorithm that comply with the basic requirement of the protocols, and
computational time of cryptographic functions involved in the algorithm. We choose
the HMAC-MD5 as the authentication algorithm to compute the keyed-hash and DESCBC as the encryption algorithm.
4.2 Simulation Scenario
The simulation measures total latency involved in the necessary protocol operations.
An important issue is the performance of authentication on the proposed tunneling
mechanism. Our objectives focus on the performance impact of the registration procedure on the proposed secure tunneling scheme. To obtain the significant result, we
describe the simulation scenarios, which take into account four different types of tunneling schemes and analyze this scenarios. The first one is basic routing mechanism,
the second employs mobile IP tunneling, the third scenario employs the tunnel mode
IPSec tunneling with AH, and the fourth use the tunnel mode IPSec tunneling with

Fig. 4. Simulation Scenario

Scenario 1: Basic Routing. The first scenario is to measure the latency caused by
raw data packet without tunneling and cryptographic operation.
Scenario 2: Mobile IP Tunneling. The second scenario is to measure the latency
caused by Mobile IP tunneling. In this case, there are two kinds of tunnel. One is the
Mobile IP tunnel between HA and firewall, the other is the reverse tunnel between
firewall and MN. Since sending a packet from a MN located within a foreign network
cannot be allowed by a firewall, we use reverse tunneling [14]. The basic
authentication between the HA and the MN is represented in this scenario. The main
reason of this stage of scenario is to get the least computational time for authentication
compared with IPSec tunneling.
Scenario 3: IPSec Tunneling with AH. The third scenario is to measure the latency
caused by the IPSec tunneling with AH protocol between firewall and MN for secure
communication. The processing time of authentication is directly proportional to the
type of security algorithm employed. Since there exist no uniform authentication
standard in Mobile IP, we have measured the performance influence of authentication
algorithm such as HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA1.
Scenario 4: IPSec Tunneling with ESP. Compared with the previous scenario, this
scenario provides the confidentiality as well as authentication. The scenario is to
measure the latency when applying the IPSec tunnel with ESP protocol. This delay
depends on the transported data in the ESP and security algorithm for authentication
and encryption. The performance has been measured the total latency and the processing time of cryptographic function. In order to compare the influence of cryptographic function processing, we use the two kinds of hash algorithm such as HMAC-

MD5 and HMAC-SHA1 for authentication, and encryption algorithm such as DESCBC and IDEA-CBC for encryption.
4.3 Simulation Result
We perform simulations of the scenarios described in section 4.2. Simulation measures the latency involved in the necessary protocol operations. Our objective focuses
on the processing overhead of cryptographic operation produced by tunneling mechanism over Mobile IP network. Therefore, we measure the influence of cryptographic
processing time in each node on the tunneling mechanism as well as total latency in
each scenario. We evaluate the performance of Mobile IP registration using IPSec
tunnel according to the following measures: total latency, time spent for cryptography
computations, and time spent for message transmission.
Fig. 5 shows total latency of registration in each scenario. Total latency includes the
message transmission delay, message generation time for registration request and
reply, updating time in table, verification time for nonce or timestamps, and encryption/decryption time. In Fig. 5, the difference between Mobile IP tunneling(scenario 2)
and IPSec AH tunneling(scenario 3) in total latency is not noticeable. But, there is a
significant difference between IPSec AH tunneling(scenario 3) and IPSec ESP tunneling(scenario 4). Fig. 6 shows the time spent for registration in each node. Since a
mobile node has limited resources, the processing time on MN is important. We can
see that the processing time produced by a MN in case scenario takes shorter than any
other. In the processing time on MN, IPSec AH tunneling is almost same as Mobile IP
tunneling. IPSec ESP tunneling is three times longer than basic routing and is 1.7
times longer than IPSec AH tunneling. IPSec ESP tunneling has obvious effect on
performance because of encapsualtion. In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we can conclude that
IPSec AH tunneling is an efficient security mechanism to provide the security service
such as authentication and integrity in firewall protected network, even though it
doesn’t provide the security service such as confidentiality.

duced only in the firewall and mobile node for IPSec tunnel whereas the rest of the
Internet remains unchanged. The proposed mechanism can be efficiently managed
since most function is concentrated in the home network’s firewall. The Mobile IP for
secure traversal of firewall in home network is transparent to the foreign network,
which adds flexibility and efficiency for a network to host Mobile IP nodes and to
provide the security services. In mobile networks, mobile nodes will require their
security function such as authentication, confidentiality and integrity in a limited time.
The proposed tunneling mechanism is not required significant processing overhead on
mobile node for security. From simulation results, we may conclude that the proposed
mechanism is reasonable performance toward the secure mobility. Our research will
be extended to support firewall-protected foreign network and to minimize the delay
in frequent handoff.
