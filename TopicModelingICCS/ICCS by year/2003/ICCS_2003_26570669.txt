Abstract. This paper focuses on modelling and visualisation of mineral
shells of foraminifera (unicellular aquatic, mainly marine, organisms).
Our recent model follows the moving reference approach of theoretical
modelling of foraminiferal shells. This model introduces three important
aspects of simulations, i.e. non-circular chamber shapes (in 2D), allometry of chambers and three dimensional simulation space. The resulted
“theoretical shells” closely mimics morphology and variability of recent
and fossil foraminifera. The model is presented as an applet at
http://www.icsr.agh.edu.pl/foraminifera.

Introduction

“Computer simulations are devised with the intention of mimicking nature and
consequently improving the understanding of natural system” [1]. One of the
greatest surprises of early theoretical morphologic modelling was that very complex organic forms could be produced by relatively simple mathematical models
[2]. This is also the case with foraminifera — single-celled organisms, which build
diverse and often complex shells. These protozoans, like many other organisms,
grow by a process of discrete, stepwise additions of elements or parts accreted
to an already existing morphology.
Majority of foraminifera are built of chambers (see Fig.1), which are cavities containing the protoplasm surrounded by a ﬁrm mineral wall [3]. The simplest shells are composed of a single chamber with a single opening (termed
as aperture). The most complex ones build their chambers divided into smaller
chamberlets with complex wall structures (see e.g. [4,5,6]). We focus on simple
multilocular (multichambered) shells with single apertures, where every chamber composes a single opening. Old apertures in multilocular shells, which are
called foramina, enable communication between all chambers, created during the
growth of the shell (see Fig.1).
Modelling of foraminifera started very early with the classical work of Berger
[7], which followed the ﬁrst publication on theoretical morphology of accretive
coiled shells [8] and ﬁrst mathematical models of plant development [9]. The
emergence of forms in the growth process of foraminiferal shells is an essential

problem in ontogenesis of these microorganisms [5,6]. Our goal is to extend and
develop the theoretical model of foraminiferal shell morphogenesis presented by
Topa and Tyszka [5,6]. This model has introduced a new approach to modelling
of foraminiferal shells based on the moving reference system [5,6]. All former
models referred to the ﬁxed reference frame, represented by an invariable (ﬁxed)
coordinate system. The moving reference model is based on simple principles of
motion and stepwise growth [10]. Such models have been developed for simulation of ammonites [11], but currently have also been applied for other organisms,
such as plants or marine sessile organisms (e.g. [12,13]).
The Topa & Tyszka model [5,6] uses real morphologic characters and follows stepwise natural biological processes. First of all, it introduces apertures
as a fundamental morphogenetic feature of all foraminiferal shells. The aperture
coordinates are based on minimisation of the local communication path, i.e. minimisation of the distance between successive openings (apertures) of chambers
(see Fig. 1c,d). This idea is partly derived from earlier studies of Hottinger [14]
and Brasier [15], who noticed that foraminifera tend to shorten the global distance between the ﬁrst and last compartment of its shell [5,6].
The purpose of this study is to extend functionality of Tyszka & Topa
model [5,6] by introducing: (1) 3D-space, (2) unrestricted (non-circular) shapes
of chambers, (3) chamber allometry, (4) numerical methods of minimisation.
“Theoretical shell morphology requires hands-on experience to be appreciated. However, very little computer software for this ﬁeld is publicly available”
[16]. We want to fulﬁl this demand, thus, the application is available for research
and educational purposes in the World Wide Web [17].

The Model

The iterative model we present in this paper is based on the concepts of moving reference system and minimisation of local communication path [5,6]. The
reference system, in which the successive chambers are constructed, is not ﬁxed
to an arbitrary deﬁned points or axes, but it changes its location along with the
growth of the foraminifera shell. The distance between the apertures of the two
successive chambers must be minimised. In opposition to the previous model [5,
6], the current model introduces chambers having any convex shape. Their contours are deﬁned by a set of points (see Fig.2a and b). In consequence the “centre
of the chamber” is chosen arbitrarily rather than in real geometric centre.
The application of diﬀerent shapes of chambers makes diﬃcult calculations
of the aperture location. The application of analytical method, similarly to the
previous model [5,6], is impossible. We have implemented a simple iterative
method. The algorithm of the minimisation looks through the points forming
a new chamber and calculates their distances to the aperture of the previous
chamber. The point, which is placed nearest the previous aperture is chosen as
an aperture of the new chamber. This method is not as precise as an analytical
approach, but high precision is not a crucial requirement in this model.

The condition is that a new aperture cannot be enclosed within any previous
chamber, thus the algorithm checks whether the point lies inside the contour
by counting the number of crossings of the line running through this point with
that contour. An odd number of crossings means that the point lies inside the
contour.
During the growth of the foraminifera, shapes of successive chambers can
change. These changes are made by scaling the chambers in x, y (and z in 3D
case) directions by appropriate coeﬃcients.
2.1

The Algorithm

The algorithm uses the following concepts:
– centre of the chamber – Oi . It is the origin of the reference system as well.
– aperture point – Ui . It describes the location of chamber aperture.

672

P. Labaj et al.

– growth vector – v i . It is attached to the aperture Ui and points the centre
of new chamber Oi+1 .
– reference growth axis. It is a base direction for the growth vector v i .
We deﬁne the following parameters of simulation:
– deviation angle – ∆φi . It is an angle between the reference growth axis and
the growth vector v i ; ∆φi ∈ −90◦ , 90◦ .
– rotation angle – βi . Angle by which the growth vector v i is rotated around
the reference growth axis; βi ∈ −180◦ , 180◦ , (only in the 3D case).
– limax — maximum length of the growth vector v i , which cannot exceed this
value, otherwise the new chamber would separate from the shell.
– si — scaling rate of the growth vector v i (0 < si < 0.9).
– kix — scaling rate of x coordinate of points forming the chamber shape.
– kiy — scaling rate of y coordinate of points forming the chamber shape.
– kiz — scaling rate of z coordinate of points forming the chamber shape, (only
in the 3D case).
Two-Dimensional Case. The simulation starts from the initial chamber. Its
shape, size and orientation are arbitrarily deﬁned. The location of the ﬁrst aperture U0 is calculated according to the local minimisation principle. The algorithm
is searching for the point forming the chamber, which lies nearest the centre of
the chamber. The initial reference growth axis is calculated as a line running
through the points O0 and U0 , i.e., the centre of the chamber and its aperture
respectively. Figure 3a shows the initial chamber.

At further steps of simulation, the reference growth axis is deﬁned as a line
running through the apertures of current and previous chambers i.e. Ui−1 and
Ui (see Fig. 3b).
The maximum length of the vector, v 0 , l0max is arbitrarily deﬁned as equal
to the length of the vector O0 M (l0max = |O0 M |). M is the point in which the
contour of initial chamber is crossing the negative part of Y0 axis (see Fig. 3a).

For each step of the simulation, the procedure of calculating a new chamber
consists of two phases:
1. Calculating the location and orientation of a new chamber:
a) the growth vector v i is calculated ﬁrst. It is attached to the aperture of
the previous chamber Ui−1 and its direction is calculated by deviating
it from the reference growth axis by angle ∆φi . The sense of the growth
vector is consistent with the sense of the vector Ui−2 Ui−1 (O0 U0 for
max
.
i = 1) and its length is calculated as: |v i | = si limax , where limax = kiy li−1
The growth vector v i attached to a previous aperture Ui−1 points to a
centre of new chamber Oi (see Fig. 4a).
b) Oi point is also the origin of a new reference system. Positive Y axis is
deﬁned by the direction of the growth vector v i (see Fig. 4b).

2. Calculating the shape of a new chamber and ﬁnding its aperture:
a) the shape of the new chamber is calculated by scaling the geometry of
the previous chamber in x and y direction by kix and kiy coeﬃcients,
respectively.

674

P. Labaj et al.

b) the location of a new aperture is calculated accordingly to the local
minimisation paradigm. The distance between the apertures of that new
chamber and the previous chamber must be the shortest. New aperture
cannot be placed within any previous chamber.
The reference growth axis for the next iteration is calculated as a line running
through the points Ui−1 and Ui (see Fig. 4c).
The apertures of the successive chambers can be connected, creating the local
communication path (see Fig. 4d).
Three-Dimensional Case. The algorithm in 3D case is similar to the 2D one.
Again, the simulation starts from the initial chamber with arbitrarily deﬁned
shape, size and orientation. The location of the ﬁrst aperture U0 is calculated
accordingly to the local minimisation principle. The initial reference growth axis
is calculated as a line running through the points: O0 and U0 (see Fig. 5a).
At further steps of simulation, the reference axis is calculated as a line running
through the the last and previous aperture Ui and Ui−1 (see Fig. 5b).
The maximum length of the vector v 0 , l0max , is equal to the length of the
vector O0 M (see Fig. 5a).
For each step of simulation, the procedure of calculating a new chamber
consist of the two phases:
1. Calculating the location and orientation of a new chamber.
a) the growth vector v i is calculated ﬁrst. It is handled at the aperture of
the previous chamber Ui−1 and its direction is calculated by deviating it
from the reference growth axis by angle ∆φi and next rotating it around
the reference axis by angle βi . If βi = 0◦ , the growth vector is included
in the plain deﬁned by points Ui−1 , Ui−2 and Ui−3 , i.e. three previous
apertures (for i = 1, in the plain deﬁned by O0 , U0 and perpendicular
to plain O0 X0 Y0 ). The sense of the growth vector is consistent with the
sense of the vector Ui−2 Ui−1 (O0 U0 for i = 1). The length of the growth
max
. The growth
vector is calculated as: |v i | = si limax , where limax = kiy li−1
vector v i handled in Ui−1 aims a centre of new chamber Oi (see Fig. 5c).
b) this point Oi becomes the origin of a new reference system. Positive Yi
axis is deﬁned by the direction of the growth vector v i .
2. Calculating the shape of a new chamber and ﬁnding its aperture.
a) the shape of a new chamber is calculated by scaling the geometry of the
previous chamber in x, y and z coordinates by kix , kiy and kiz coeﬃcients,
respectively.
b) the aperture of that new chamber must be as close to the aperture of the
previous chamber as possible. It cannot be enclosed within any previous
chamber (see Fig. 5d).
The reference growth axis for the next iteration is calculated as a line running
through the points Ui−1 and Ui (see Fig. 5d).

Implementation

The model has been implemented as an Java applet with the Java3D library for
visualisation purpose. It can be run from the WWW page [17] (see Fig. 6).
The applet allows users to manipulate most of parameters of the simulation
(kix,y,z , si ). In 2D case, the shape of the chamber can be chosen from the set of
predeﬁned contours. In 3D case, the only available shape of chamber is ellipsoidal.

Discussion and Conclusions

Our recent model follows the moving reference approach in theoretical modelling
of foraminiferal shells. It extends functionality of the former model by application
of new parameters leading to improvement of simulation results (see Figs. 7).
The presented model introduces new elements, that were absent in the Topa &
Tyszka model. Some of them (3D model, allometric scaling of chambers) have
been postulated in [5,6]. Due to introduction of chambers with various shapes,
the numerical algorithm of minimisation had to be implemented instead of using

model does not use stochastic parameters, which should be applied in future (see
Table 1 for comparison).

This model is an important step towards realistic modelling of foraminiferal
shells and understanding of their morphogenetic processes. It extends complexity
of the morphospace, which gets closer to reality (see Fig. 7). This aspect of the
model should be investigated in future. The ﬁrst attempt to the morphospace
of the Topa & Tyszka model can be found in [6]. However, this model exploits
larger number of parameters and deﬁnition of its morphospace is much more
complicated. Despite of signiﬁcant improvements the presented model is still a

serious simpliﬁcation. In the next step, we plan to remove all elements, which are
arbitrarily deﬁned, e.g. calculating the maximum length of the growth vector. It
would be also necessary to eliminate the parts of chambers which are enclosed in
preceding chambers. This has not been solved so far, because it must be based
on a diﬀerent and more natural approach.

The applet will be expanded by adding an extra base of predeﬁned shapes
of chambers prepared on the models of chambers that are met in the nature.
The visualisation of the virtual foraminifera shells, mainly for the 3D model,
should be also improved to make them look more realistic (e.g. by using suitable
textures).
