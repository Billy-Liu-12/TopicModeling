Abstract. We construct ﬁnite diﬀerence solutions of a transmission
problem with a discontinuous coeﬃcient and the Dirac distribution by
the direct method which we call the successive elimination of lines and
then show that the limit function of them satisﬁes the transmission equation in the sense of distribution.

Introduction

This paper is devoted to the construction and the convergence of ﬁnite diﬀerence
solutions based on the direct method coupled with the ﬁctitious domain method
([2],[9])and distribution theoretical argument ([1]).
Let Ω be a rectangular domain in R2 , Ω1 be an open subset of Ω and Ω2 = Ω\Ω1 ,
the interface of them be denoted by Γ (= Ω1 ∩ Ω2 ) and Γ be of class C 1 . The
transmission problem considered here is the followings.
Problem I. For f ∈ L2 (Ω), σ ∈ L2 (Γ ) and g ∈ H 1/2 (∂Ω), ﬁnd u ∈ H 1 (Ω)
such that
− div (a(x, y) ∇u) = f + σ δΓ in D (Ω) ,
(1)
u = g

on ∂Ω .

Here we assume that the discontinuous function a is given by
a(x, y) =

if (x, y) ∈

for any subset Π of Ω.
Equations (1) of this type are arisen in various contexts. One of such examples
can be found in the context of electricity and { 1 , 2 } is corresponding to the

We now notice that Problem I is equivalent to the following problem II.
Problem II. Find λ ∈ H 1/2 (Γ ) and {u1 (λ), u2 (λ)} ∈ H 1 (Ω1 ) × H 1 (Ω2 ) such
that

From this point of view, the purpose of this paper is to show how to solve
(8) directly.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ﬁnite diﬀerence
approximation of Problem I. Section 3 is devoted to our numerical algorithm from
the viewpoint of the successive elimination of lines coupled with the geometry
of domains Ω1 and Ω2 . In Sect. 4, we shall prove the justiﬁcation of the ﬁnite
diﬀerence scheme and ﬁnally discuss the convergence of approximate solutions
constructed in Section 3.

Finite Diﬀerence Approximation of Problem I

Without loss of generality we assume that g = 0 and that Ω is the unit square
in R2 , i.e., Ω = {(x, y)| 0 < x, y < 1 }. Let h ∈ R be a mesh size such that
h = 1/n for an integer n and set ∆ x = ∆ y = h. We associate with it the set of
the grid points:
Ω h = {Pi,j ∈ R2 | Pi,j = (i h, j h), 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n},
Ωh = {Pi,j ∈ R2 | Pi,j = (i h, j h), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1}.
With each grid point Pi,j of Ω h , we associate the panel ωi,0

(ii) uh → u weakly in L2 (Ω), u ∈ H 1 (Ω), and
(iii) u is the solution of Problem I in the sense of distrubution.

Construction of the Solution of (13)
Geometry of Domain and Principle of the Successive
Elimination of Lines

In this subsection we deal with the (n − 1) vectors {Ui } instead of the (n − 1)2
unknowns ui,j . For each i, set Ui = t [ui,1 , ui,2 , · · · , ui,n−1 ] (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1).
From the equations (13), it follows that

Now ﬁx i (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1). Paying attention to the vector Ui in (15) and setting
E
S

ai,j = aW
i,j + ai,j + ai,j + ai,j , Problem F w.r.t. {ui,j } is reduced to Problem M

(18)

Remark 2. For each i(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1), Ai is a symmetric matrix.
S
In fact, aN
i,j = ai,j+1 holds from the deﬁnition (12).
Moreover in order to reduce the numbers of equations of Problem M, we separate
unknown vector Ui into two parts considering the geometry of the domain Ω
and the interface Γ . We ﬁrst introduce the set of interface lattice points Γh and
boundary lattice points ∂Ωh as follows;
1
(i) Γh = {Pi,j = (ih, jh) | Γ ∩ ωi,j
= ∅},
(ii) ∂Ωh = Ω h \ Ωh .

392

H. Koshigoe

Division of the Unknown Vector {Ui }
For each Ui = {ui,j }1≤j≤n−1 , we deﬁne Ui = {ui,j }1≤j≤n−1 and
Wi = {wi,j }1≤j≤n−1 as follows;
ui,j =

if Pi,j ∈ Γh
if Pi,j ∈ Ωh \Γh ,

0
ui,j

ui,j
0

wi,j =

if Pi,j ∈ Γh
if Pi,j ∈ Ωh \Γh

(19)

and devide Ui into two parts by
Ui = Ui + Wi .

(20)

We then introduce the new vector {Vi } deﬁned by
E
Vi = AW
i Ui ( = Ai Ui )

(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1).

(21)

From the deﬁnition of {Ui } and {Vi }, we get
E
Lemma 1. Ai Ui = B Vi , Aw
hold (1 ≤ i ≤
i Ui−1 = Vi−1 and Ai Ui+1 = Vi+1
n − 1) . Here B is a block tridiagonal matrix in the discretization of the Laplace
operator in Ω with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. i.e., B = [bij ]
is an (n − 1) × (n − 1) tridiagonal matrix such that B = tridiag[−1, 4, −1].

Therefore the following equations are derived from Problem M, (17)-(21) and
Lemma 1.
Problem PN. Find {Vi , Wi } such that for i(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
B Vi = Vi−1 + Vi+1 + Fi +

E
AW

(22)

where V0 = Vn = W0 = Wn = 0.
Moreover in order to deduce the equation of {Wi } from Problem PN, we review the princple of the successive elimination of lines. The following proposition
1 was proved under two assumptions
Assumption 1. Let B = tridiag[−1, 4, −1] ∈ R(n−1)×(n−1) .
Assumption 2. Let Xi and Yi ∈ R(n−1) be satisfying the equations of the
form : B Xi = Xi−1 + Xi+1 + Yi (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1).
Proposition 1. Under the above assumptions, Xk (1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1) is directly
determined by

and Q(= (qi,j )1≤i,j≤n−1 ) is the othogonal matrix such that
qi,j =

(1 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1).

(25)

Remark 3. We call this proposition the princile of the successive elimination of
lines (see also [6],[7],[11]).
Remark 4. Set Qi =t (qi,1 , qi,2 , · · · · · · , qi,n−1 ) (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1). Then
{Qi }1≤i≤n−1 is the orthonormal system, which is used in the next subsection.
3.2

Numerical Algorithm

In this subsection, we show our numerical algorithm by use of the principle of the
successive elimination of lines. First applying directly Proposition 1 to Problem
PN, we have
Lemma 2. Problem PN is equivalent to f ind {Vk , Wk }(1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1) satisfying

Using the orthogonal property of Q and the deﬁnitions of Vk and Γh , we get
t

Ql QVk = 0 for any l such that Pk,l ∈ Γh ,

from which it follows
Lemma 3. {Wi }1≤i≤n−1 in (26) satisf ies the equations (27):

for (k, l) such that Pk,l ∈ Γh .
Conversely one may have a question whether it is possible to construct {Vk , Wk }
uniquely satisfying (26) from the equation (27). But the answer is yes and we
shall prove it in the next section as the following theorem.
Theorem 1. There exists a unique solution {Wi }1≤i≤n−1 of the linear system
(27).
Hence the remainder part {Vk }1≤k≤n−1 of {Ui }1≤i≤n−1 is automatically computed by Theorem 1 and Lemma 2. i.e.,

Convergence of Approximate Solutions

In order to justify our numerical scheme(13), we ﬁrst deﬁne the piecewise function θα,β ( 0 ≤ α, β ≤ n) as follows;
0
1, (x, y) ∈ ω0,0
θα,β (x, y) = θ(x − α h, y − β h) where θ(x, y) =
0
0, (x, y) ∈
/ ω0,0 ,
and θ0,j = θn,j = θi,0 = θi,n = 0 (i, j = 1, · · · , n). We then introduce the function
space Vh generated by θi,j . i.e., φ ∈ Vh , is of the form:
n−1

φ(x, y) =

φi,j θi,j (x, y),

φi,j ∈ R .

(28)

i,j=1

We now introduce the following approximation {δh1 , δh2 , ∇h , (div)h } of {∂/∂x,
∂/∂y, ∇, div } .
(i) δh1 , δh2 : L∞ (R2 ) → L∞ (R2 ) are deﬁned by
(δh1 u)(x, y) =

1
h

u(x + 12 h, y) − u(x − 12 h, y) ,

(δh2 u)(x, y) =

1

u(x, y + 12 h) − u(x, y − 12 h) .

(ii) ∇h : L∞ (R2 ) → (L∞ (R2 ))2 is deﬁned by
(∇h u)(x, y) = (δh1 u)(x, y), (δh2 u)(x, y) .

(29)

(iii) (div)h : (L∞ (R2 ))2 → L∞ (R2 ) is deﬁned by
(div)h (u(x, y), v(x, y)) = (δh1 u)(x, y) + (δh2 v)(x, y)

for u, v ∈ L (R ).
Then the norm ·

We ﬁrst propose the following approximation of Problem I in Vh .
Problem V. Find uh ∈ Vh such that

We then get a following relation between Problem F and Problem V.
Lemma 5. Problem F and Problem V are equivalent.

Using the discrete Poincar´e inequality and the trace theorem ([5]), we get
Proposition 2. There exists a unique function uh ∈ Vh satisfying (33).
The uniqueness of {Wi } in (27) is now proved.
Proof of Theorem 1. Assume that there are two solutions {Wi } and {Wi }
satisfying the linear system (27). Then from Lemma 2, and (19)-(21), there
are two solutions {Ui } and {Ui } of Problem F. But this is contradictory to
Proposition 2 by use of Lemma 5. Therefore the unique existence of the solution
{Wi } is ensured.

We proceed to discuss the convergence of {uh }.
Theorem 3. (i) There exists u ∈ H01 (Ω) such that uh → u weakly in L2 (Ω).

Proof. We divide the proof into four steps.
Step 1. There exists a subsequence uh , also denoted by uh , such that
uh → u weakly in L2 (Ω) and ∇h uh → ∇u weakly in L2 (Ω).
In fact, it follows from the bilinear form of (33) in Vh and the discrete Poincar´e
inequality.
Step 2. fh → f in L2 (Ω) and aW
aSh → a a.e. in Ω .
h → a a.e. in Ω,

Because f ∈ L (Ω) and a is continuous in Ω\Γ .
Step 3. σh → σ · δ(Γ ) in D (Ω).
In fact, Set I ≡ σh − σ · δ(Γ ), φ . Then

Therefore combining it with the distribution formula, Step 4 is shown.
Finally we are able to conclude that the full sequence {uh } converges weakly to
the solution u of Problem I since Problem I has a unique solution in H 1 (Ω) as
well known fact(cf. [8,10]).
