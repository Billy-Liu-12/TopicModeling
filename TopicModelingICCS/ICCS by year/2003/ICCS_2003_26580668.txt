Abstract. Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed for 9×9 bilayers formed by gemini surfactants p-[C19 H39 N + (CH3 )2 CH2 ]2 C6 H4 ·
2Cl− or [C19 H39 N + (CH3 )2 CH2 ]2 CH(OH) · 2Cl− with rigid hydrophobic
or ﬂexible hydrophilic types of spacer respectively. The structure of the
bilayers is rather diﬀerent depending on the type of spacer regarding the
eﬀect of NaCl salt addition. It is shown that the structure of the bilayer
strongly depends on the interaction between the surfactant head groups
and the counter ions.

Introduction

An experimental study of gemini surfactants with diﬀerent types of spacer has
been reported in a number of papers [1,2,3]. So-called gemini or bis-surfactants
are formed by two novel surface active molecules connected via a ﬂexible or
rigid linkage between the hydrophilic head groups. These systems are of interest
due to a number of unusual properties. One of these is that the CMC value increases when the hydrocarbon chain of the hydrophobic tail reaches some value.
This observation is in contradiction with the well-known fact that the CMC
value - in general - monotonically decreases with tail lengthening. It is worth
to mention that some novel surfactants with long hydrophobic tail display similar behaviour. To understand the physical backgroud of these unusual micellar
properties, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used.
Molecular Dynamics study is a method to observe the microscopic structure
of aggregates and to extract a number of macroscopic parameters to be used in
thermodynamic models of micellization. Spontaneous formation of spherical or
rodlike micelles (depending on surfactant concentration) from a random initial
conﬁguration has been reported in a number of papers [4,5,6,7]. Self-organization
was observed for systems where the concentration of surfactants exceeds the
CMC value. MD simulation with random starting conﬁguration allows us to
estimate the CMC value of a surfactant with a given molecular structure. However, this method cannot be applied to systems with a CMC value below some

limit due to computational expenses. For example, in the case of a CMC value
of 10−3 M, the number of water molecules per surfactant is greater than 55000;
for a spherical micelle with average aggregation number about 60, the size of
the system is then too large to observe aggregation in a standard MD simulation starting from a random initial conﬁguration. The reasonable way of MD
simulations of such systems is to construct a bicontinuous bilayer surrounded by
water [8].
In this work, MD simulations have been performed to compare the properties of bilayers formed by gemini surfactants (see Fig. 1) with rigid and ﬂexible
spacers. The length of the hydrocarbon chains in both cases was taken as 19
carbon atoms. To observe the eﬀect of electrolyte addition on the bilayer structure, the simulations were carried out also for systems with 3 percent of N aCl
salt. Overall four systems have been considered. The ﬁrst one includes gemini
surfactant with rigid hydrophobic spacer [(C19 H39 N + (CH3 )2 CH2 )2 Ar] · Cl2− .
We will label this system as ”Gemini-Ar”. The second system is the same
but with 3 percent of added N aCl; the label is ”Gemini-Ar-NaCl”. The
last two systems include a gemini surfactant with ﬂexible hydrophilic spacer
[(C19 H39 N + (CH3 )2 CH2 )2 CH(OH)] · Cl2− . We will refer to these as ”GeminiOH” and ”Gemini-OH-NaCl” depending on salt addition.

MD Simulation Details

The simulations were carried out using GROMACS [9] software running in parallel [10] under MPI environment on an SGI Origin 2000 supercomputer equipped
with 32 CPUs. Actually not more than 12 processors were utilized due to communication overhead. The GROMACS united atom force ﬁeld was used. Equilibrium molecular geometry and atomic charge distributions were taken from
semiempirical calculations using the MNDO hamiltonian model. The quantum
chemical calculations were performed using the GAMESS [11] program package. The charges of united atom groups (CHn ) were calculated as the sum of
atomic charges over all atoms of given functional group. The major part of the
total charge (+2) is found to be distributed over the surfactant head group and
the tail hydrocarbon group directly connected to nitrogen. The MOPAC atomic
charges on united atoms are given in Fig. 1.
The basic cell has orthogonal geometry with periodic boundary conditions
applied in all dimensions. The bilayer was positioned in the middle of the box
perpendicular to z axis. The rest of the basic cell was ﬁlled with water (SPC
model) and ions. To build a bilayer with a density close to the density of liquid
hydrocarbons, a special technique was developed. The problem is that - due to
the equilibrium molecular geometry of the surfactants under investigation - the
constructed bilayer has many cavities between the tails, which are ﬁlled with
water and ions. The idea is to generate a large number of conformations by
running MD simulation of a single surfactant molecule and than ﬁnd a geometry
that provides a suitable density. A number of criteria was used to select the
best conﬁguration from formally acceptable ones. The resulting bilayers were

formed by 162 surfactant molecules (9×9) and hardly contain any water inside
the hydrophobic core. A summary of all systems studied is presented in Table 1.
The MD simulations were performed at a constant temperature of 300 K and
a constant pressure of 1 bar using the Berendsen external bath coupling [12].
To take into account the eﬀect of water penetration inside the bilayer, the basic cell was scaled isotropically in x and y directions but diﬀerently in z direction (so-called ”semiisotropic” coupling). The bonds were constrained using
the SHAKE algorithm and it’s special implementation for rigid water molecules
(SETTLE) [13]. The leap-frog method with time step 2 fs was used to integrate
the equations of motion. A cut-oﬀ distance of 1 nm was applied to all intermolecular interactions. Due to slow penetration of water into the surfactant bilayer,
the geometry of basic cell changes. To speed up equilibration, the simulation
was split up in two parts: ﬁrst, long-range electrostatic interactions were cut at

Switching on the PME summation results in a rapid decrease of the cell size in z
direction. Equilibrium was deﬁned as the point where the cell geometry becomes
stable.

Analysis of MD Data

The aim of our MD simulation is to clarify the dependence of bilayer structure
on the chemical nature of the surfactant and salt addition. The only diﬀerence
between the surfactants under investigation is the structure of the spacer: rigid
hydrophobic in case of Gemini-Ar and ﬂexible hydrophilic in case of Gemini-OH.
As will be shown below, the nature of the spacer has a dramatic eﬀect on the
behaviour of bilayer.
The equilibrium size of the basic box in x, y and z dimensions provides us
with information about the average surface area a per surfactant (see Table 2).
Note that we neglect the curvature of the bilayer when calculating the average
surface area as x · y divided by number of surfactant in one layer. It is surprising
that the surface area per molecule is smaller for Gemini-Ar than for GeminiOH: obviously the excluded volume of the CH2 C6 H4 CH2 spacer (and therefore
the size of the head group) is larger than for CH2 CH(OH)CH2 (see Fig. 1).
Furthermore, in the case of adding 3 weight per cent N aCl to the GeminiAr system results in an expansion of the cell in z but squeezing in x and y
dimensions. Hence the area per surfactant decreases from 77.7 ˚
A2 to 69.9 ˚
A2
(see Table 2). The eﬀect of the salt on the geometry of basic box in case of
A2 .
Gemini-OH is quite opposite: the area a increases from 97.7 ˚
A2 up to 106.4 ˚
These eﬀects can be related with a partial binding of the chloride ions, screening
electrostatic repulsion between the charged head groups.

hydrocarbon core of the membrane so that the head groups are surrounded
by water. Note that the bilayer formed by Gemini-Ar surfactant has a more
diﬀuse boundary with bulk water than the bilayer formed by Gemini-OH. A
sharp water-membrane boundary is typical for ionic surfactants with a negatively
charged head group [8]. In the case of gemini surfactants, the boundary is not
well-deﬁned, so one needs a way to measure the thickness of the bilayer. It is
suitable to determine the thickness of the membrane as the distance between the
points where the density proﬁles of water and hydrocarbon groups cross. In this
way the thickness will depend on water penetration into bilayer. The degree of
water penetration into the membrane for diﬀerent systems can be estimated as
an overlap integral SW T between the number density proﬁles of water nW and
hydrocarbon groups of the tail nT :
SW T =

(1)

The overlap integral SW T as well as the thickness H of the membrane are presented in Table 2. The thickness of the bilayer formed by Gemini-OH surfactant
is signiﬁcantly smaller than for Gemini-Ar systems and decreases when adding
salt while the thickness of Gemini-Ar bilayer increases. The dependence of the
SW T parameter on addition of salt is the same. The density proﬁles of head
groups, chloride and sodium ions (see Fig. 2, bottom) also show that GeminiOH systems have a more compact structure of the water-bilayer boundary. Note
that the head group and chloride ion proﬁles are very close to each other. This
means that the best part of the counter ions is bound to the head groups.
3.2

Radial Distribution Functions

The analysis of radial distribution functions (RDF) provides us with more detailed information about the structure of the bilayer. As mentioned above, changing from a rigid hydrophobic to a ﬂexible hydrophilic spacer causes a dramatic
distinction in membrane behaviour. The bilayer properties strongly depend on
the chemistry of the head group but not on the hydrophobic tail. Interaction of
charged heads with ions also plays a key role. Keeping these in mind, we will

right edges due to smoothing.

focus our investigation on the set of RDFs related to head-head, head-ions and
head-water interaction. The aim is to clarify the origin of the diﬀerent salt eﬀect
on bilayer structure.
The nitrogen-nitrogen radial distribution functions (see Fig. 3, left top) have a
well-deﬁned peak that corresponds to two nitrogen atoms of the same surfactant
molecule. For Gemini-OH systems this peak is at r=0.46 nm while a second
maximum at r=0.86 nm corresponds with non-bonded nitrogen atoms. In the
case of the Gemini-Ar system, these maxima are very close to each other and
form one asymmetric peak. The position and magnitude of the peaks of nitrogennitrogen RDFs are almost independent of salt addition (see Table 3). The number
of neighbors Nc in the ﬁrst coordination shell was calculated as integral over the
RDF up to the ﬁrst minimum. The nitrogen-nitrogen coordination number for
Gemini-Ar is about 10 but only 6.5 in case of Gemini-OH system. This means

674

D. Yakovlev and E.S. Boek

that the bilayer formed by Gemini-Ar surfactants has a diﬀuse boundary with
water because the coordination number is too high for a planar structure. The
analysis shows that the positions of the extrema and values of surface area per
surfactant for the Gemini-Ar bilayer correspond to hexagonal packing, while the
Gemini-OH membrane more likely has an ortorhombic packing. Salt addition
causes Nc to increase from 9.8 up to 10.2 for Gemini-Ar but to decrease from
6.5 to 6.2 for the Gemini-OH system.
The nitrogen-chloride RDFs demonstrate a strong coupling between chloride
ions and head groups. The position of the ﬁrst maximum remains the same for
all systems but the magnitude is subject to change (see Fig. 3, top right and
Table 3). Nitrogen has 2.0-2.2 chloride ions in the closest shell for Gemini-Ar and
2.3-2.7 for the Gemini-OH bilayer. Taking into account that each CH3 group of
the head has exactly one chloride in the ﬁrst shell and using molecular geometry,
one can conclude that the anions around nitrogen are the ones bound with positively charged CH3 groups connected to nitrogen. The second maximum of the
CH3 (head)-chloride RDF (Fig. 3, Table 3) corresponds to chloride of the other
CH3 group. In case of the Gemini-OH bilayer, chloride ions are also bound with
the OH functional group. The oxygen-chloride radial distribution function for
Gemini-OH (Fig. 3, bottom right) has a sharp ﬁrst maximum. The benzene ring
of Gemini-Ar surfactant has no bound ions as can be observed in the CH(head)chloride RDF (Fig. 3, bottom left) where CH are the benzene ring atoms (see
Fig. 1). The chloride ion connected to the hydroxyl group of Gemini-OH contributes to the ﬁrst peak of the nitrogen-chloride RDF and the second peak
of CH3 (head)-chloride and increases the corresponding coordination numbers.
Salt addition always decreases the number of chloride ions in coordination shells
because part of chlorides become involved in the formation of ionic pairs with
sodium (see Table 3). This is conﬁrmed by the observation that the number of
chloride ions in the ﬁrst coordination shell of sodium (1.3) is greater than one.
The positions of the extrema of CH3 (head)-oxygen(water) RDFs are the same
for all systems. The number of water molecules in the ﬁrst hydration shell of
the CH3 group is 0.5 only. The reason is that the head groups are surrounded
mainly by chloride ions, not by water.

Results and Discussion

The data presented above demonstrates many distinctions in the structure of bilayers formed by gemini surfactants with diﬀerent types of spacer. The surfactant
with a ﬂexible hydrophilic spacer gives us a thin membrane with a well-deﬁned
surface. Changing to a hydrophobic rigid spacer leads to a bilayer with a diﬀuse
boundary. The most interesting question is why salt addition aﬀects the membrane properties in an opposite way. The analysis of radial distribution functions
allows us to observe that the interaction between head group and chloride ions
controls the behaviour of the bilayer. Packing, bilayer thickness, area per surfactant, water penetration are diﬀerent for Gemini-Ar and Gemini-OH systems
but these properties are secondary. Comparing radial distribution functions for

surfactants with various types of spacer, one can state that the diﬀerence is in
the interaction of the head group with chloride ions. The heads of Gemini-OH
surfactants coordinate a little bit more chloride ions in the closest shell than
Gemini-Ar. The equilibrium thickness of the surfactant membrane is found to
be smaller for Gemini-OH than for Gemini-Ar, because the former has a more
ﬂexible molecular structure.
