Abstract. The numerical solution of the time dependent wave equation
in an unbounded domain generally leads to a truncation of this domain,
which requires the introduction of an artiﬁcial boundary with associated
boundary conditions. Such nonreﬂecting conditions ensure the equivalence between the solution of the original problem in the unbounded
region and the solution inside the artiﬁcial boundary. We consider the
acoustic wave equation and derive exact transparent boundary conditions
that are local in time and can be directly used in explicit methods. These
conditions annihilate wave harmonics up to a given order on a spherical
artiﬁcial boundary, and we show how to combine the derived boundary
condition with a ﬁnite diﬀerence method. The analysis is complemented
by a numerical example in two spatial dimensions that illustrates the
usefulness and accuracy of transparent boundary conditions.

Introduction

Modern trends in the development of numerical methods lead to higher and
higher requirements for computational accuracy. The numerical solution of the
wave equation on unbounded domains requires a truncation to ﬁt the inﬁnite
region on a ﬁnite computer. Minimizing the amount of spurious reﬂections requires in many cases the introduction of an artiﬁcial boundary and of associated
boundary conditions. The critical importance of these techniques becomes particularly evident when one considers that the gains made in the computational
domain by using sophisticated high-order numerical approaches may vanish to
a large extent as result of violating the conditions at the artiﬁcial boundary.
Despite the computational speed of ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes and the robustness of ﬁnite elements in handling complex geometries the resulting numerical
error consists of two independent contributions: the discretization error of the
numerical method used and the spurious reﬂection generated at the artiﬁcial
boundary. This spurious contribution travels back and substantially degrades
the accuracy of the solution everywhere in the computational domain. Unless
both error components are reduced systematically, the numerical solution does
not converge to the solution of the original problem in the inﬁnite region.
There are various techniques for the approximate handling of boundary conditions at the external boundary of a ﬁnite domain constructed from the original

unbounded domain by means of truncation. One class of conditions is given by
local diﬀerential operators [2], [3], including conditions that perfectly annihilate
impinging waves at a ﬁnite number of selected angles of incidence [4], whilst a
diﬀerent approach is based on absorbing layers [5]. There are cases, where some
of the diﬃculties with boundary conditions may be avoided partially by using a
momentum space approach [6]. In contrast to grid methods in coordinate space
where continuum waves spread over the entire space, in momentum space the
waves are conﬁned to a small ﬁnite volume and the dynamics stays localized
around the origin at all times.
Exact nonreﬂecting boundary conditions that are nonlocal in both space and
time have been investigated numerically in [7]. Numerical methods based on
these exact conditions display a long-time instability, and a major disadvantage
is related to the nonlocal character of the boundary condition in time. Due to
the temporal nonlocality that requires information from previous time steps,
these methods require a considerably longer computational time than explicit
schemes for the wave equation. Recently, very important progress has been made
by Grote and Keller [8] by deriving exact nonreﬂecting boundary conditions that
are local in time.
In the present work we study exact transparent boundary conditions that
are local in time for the scalar wave equation for the general case in two and
three spatial dimensions. In contrast to [8] where an integral equation is used,
our approach is based on the separation of variables combined with recurrence
relations that provide a very direct derivation of the boundary condition. Since
the derived condition is local in time and is equivalent to the result obtained
in [8], our formulation complements the integral transform approach and is expected to have applications to cases where the latter method is diﬃcult to apply.
The local character in time of the boundary condition and its explicit representation that requires only ﬁrst order derivatives of the solution makes it
relatively easy to apply in calculations based on explicit schemes. In contrast
to earlier studies based on exact but nonlocal boundary conditions, the present
ﬁnite diﬀerences implementation does not require a signiﬁcant increase in the
computational time. This highlights a key point in practical applications of such
conditions in that the related implementations should not become computationally too expensive. In Sec. 2, we illustrate the fundamental ideas underlying the
derivation of nonreﬂecting boundary conditions for the one-dimensional case and
present the extension to higher dimensions. In Sec. 3 we discuss the implementation in a ﬁnite diﬀerences scheme and present a simple two dimensional numerical
example that illustrates the usefulness of transparent boundary conditions. The
conclusions of the present study are given in Sec. 4.

2.1

Theoretical Approach
The One-Dimensional Wave Equation

We consider the one-dimensional wave equation describing the propagation of
perturbations along the positive real axis (x ≥ 0, t ≥ 0) with velocity c = 1 that

Transparent Boundary Conditions for Wave Propagation on Unbounded Domains

are induced by a general and possibly nonlinear forcing term f = f (x, t, Φ, ∂x Φ)
∂t2 − ∂x2 Φ(x, t) = f ,

(1)

where Φ(x, t) represents the displacement of an inﬁnitely long string and ∂t =
∂/∂t. Upon requiring Φ(0, t) = 0 for the state at rest we assume Φ(x, t) to
describe the position of a string ﬁxed at the origin. We deﬁne the initial conditions by the string position and velocity at t = 0 by Φ(x, 0) = U0 and
∂t Φ(x, t) |t=0 = V0 .
The local character of the problem is deﬁned by assuming f = 0 for x ≥
L, ∀ t ≥ 0. Thus, the positive x-axis separates into two distinctly diﬀerent
regions: the bounded (interior) domain x ≤ L, and the unbounded (exterior)
region x ≥ L where the forcing term f vanishes. The two regions are separated
by the artiﬁcial boundary at x = L.
To ﬁnd the exact absorbing boundary condition at x = L it is useful to separate
outgoing from incoming waves by deﬁning
v = ∂t Φ + ∂x Φ,

and

w = ∂t Φ − ∂ x Φ .

(2)

Since Φ(x, t) is a solution of Eq. (1) for x ≥ L, i.e. (∂t2 − ∂x2 )Φ = 0, in the exterior
region from (2)
0 = (∂t − ∂x ) [(∂t + ∂x )Φ] = (∂t − ∂x )v ,
(3)
0 = (∂t + ∂x ) [(∂t − ∂x )Φ] = (∂t + ∂x )w .
This system of ﬁrst-order equations has the general solution
v(x, t) = ψ(x + t),

and

w(x, t) = ϕ(x − t) ,

(4)

where ψ and ϕ are arbitrary functions that are determined by initial and boundary conditions. Thus, incoming (v) and outgoing (w) waves are deﬁned as
v(x, t) = const., for x + t = const.

(incoming)

w(x, t) = const., for x − t = const.

(outgoing) .

(5)
Since there are no incoming waves in the exterior region, it follows v(L, t) = 0.
The requirement of a purely outgoing wave for x ≥ L combined with the deﬁnition for incoming waves v from eq. (2) yields the exact nonreﬂecting boundary
condition for the displacement Φ(x, t)
(∂t + ∂x ) Φ(x, t) |x=L = 0 .

(6)

This expression which is local in time guarantees that the artiﬁcial boundary
at x = L is perfectly transparent to both incoming and outgoing waves as they
leave the interior region without any spurious reﬂection. Note that since the
derivation of the exact boundary condition (6) depends solely on properties in
the exterior domain, x ≥ L, the problem inside the computational volume can
be arbitrarily complex.

Transparent Boundary Conditions in Higher Dimensions

The derivation of exact absorbing boundary conditions in higher dimensions is
considerably more challenging as compared to the one dimensional case discussed
previously. Distinctly diﬀerent from the one-dimensional case where waves can
propagate in two directions only, in two and more dimensions waves propagate
in inﬁnitely many directions.
In the following we consider wave propagation in an unbounded region IR 3
˜ containing the forcing term f by an
and surround the computational region Ω
artiﬁcial boundary S that is assumed to be the surface of a sphere with radius
R. In the exterior domain one has f = 0, and the wave function ψ(r, t) satisﬁes
the homogeneous wave equation with propagation velocity c > 0, i.e.

with initial conditions ψ(r, 0) = 0 and ∂t ψ(r, 0) = 0. It is useful to separate the
variables by expanding the solution in spherical coordinates r, ϑ, ϕ

As shown in Sec. 2.1, a general solution for outgoing waves is written as Φ(r−ct),

where we have substituted Φ˜l,m = (−)l Φl,m /R and the inhomogeneous term
ψl,m (R, t) is given by Eq. (10) evaluated at r = R.
Expression (20) represents the exact nonreﬂecting boundary condition in the
form obtained in [8] where integral transforms formed the basis of the approach.
Note that in practical calculations truncation of the summation over l at a ﬁnite
value l = L leads to an exact representation of modes with l ≤ L. Thus, the
boundary condition reduces to B1 ψ|r=R = 0 for harmonic modes with l >
L. In particular, B1 ψ|r=R = 0 is an exact boundary condition for spherically
symmetric modes (l = 0).

Numerical Results Using Finite Diﬀerences

Using the results of the previous section, we illustrate the use of transparent
boundary conditions and their numerical implementation using a ﬁnite diﬀerence
formulation. The wave equation is discretized both in space and time using
centred ﬁnite diﬀerences. At time tk = k ∆t, we denote by Ψ k (n) the numerical
approximation to the time dependent wave function ψ(r, t) and by f k (n) the
forcing term at the n-th grid point rn in radial direction [8]. The numerical
solution is advanced in time using
Ψ k+1 (n) = 2 Ψ k (n) − Ψ k−1 (n) + (∆t)2 D Ψ k (n) + f k (n)

, (22)

where D represents a ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation to the Laplace operator ∆.
An apparent complication occurs when the Laplace operator is to be calculated at the outer most radial grid point, rn = R, since this calculation uses
values of Ψ k (n + 1) belonging to the exterior region. However this problem can
be solved by using the explicit representation of the derived boundary condition. More precisely, one obtains an additional relation between the quantities
Ψ k+1 (n) and Ψ k (n + 1) by using a ﬁnite diﬀerence representation of the boundary condition equation (20) at rn = R. Consequently, the problem is solved by
coupling the two equations for Ψ k+1 (n) and Ψ k (n + 1), allowing one to solve for
Ψ k+1 (n). Due to the local character in time of the boundary condition, both the
diﬀerential equation and the boundary condition are discretized in time about
t = tk , and only function values at t = tk are needed in a given time step [8].
This procedure becomes particularly simple and is best illustrated using a
cartesian grid xn = n∆x in one dimension. The second space derivative ∂x2 is
written as
D Ψ k (n) =

Ψ k (n + 1) − 2 Ψ k (n) + Ψ k (n − 1)
,
(∆x)2

(23)

and using the ﬁnite diﬀerence representation of the boundary condition we arrive
after some algebra at
Ψ k (n + 1) = −

1 ∆x
Ψ k+1 (n) − Ψ k−1 (n)
c ∆t

+ Ψ k (n − 1) ,

(24)

which represents the additional equation for Ψ k+1 (n). By combining the two
equations for Ψ k+1 (n) and Ψ k (n + 1) one ﬁnds
Ψ k+1 (n) =

2 Ψ k (n) + (α − 1)Ψ k−1 (n) + 2 α2 Ψ k (n − 1) − Ψ k (n)
(25)
1 + α

where α = c∆t/∆x. This expression clearly shows that the evaluation of the time
extrapolated function Ψ k+1 (n) at the boundary does not depend on function
values located outside the computational domain.
Using the approach described above we are now in a position to analyse
the time evolution of perturbations using transparent boundary conditions. In
Figures 1 and 2 we display snapshots of the two-dimensional wave function at
diﬀerent times for t = 82, 128, 270, 450, and 900, respectively. The contour plots
on the right hand side of the ﬁgures display the position of time evolved waves
in the xy-plane, where the computational domain extends from an inner radius
r< = 1000 km to the outer radius r> = 6371 km, and we used ∆t = 2.5 s,
dr 3.5 km, and c = 5 km/s. The plots on the left show the dependence of the
associated wave function on the radial coordinate r. While the starting point
of the calculation is t = 0, the perturbing source is assumed to be proportional
4700 km. This
to a Gaussian exp(t − t0 )2 and is located on a circle with r0
may be associated with an explosive point source that is located at the origin
r< = r0 → 0 in the far past. For t = 82 we observe a strong peak located in the
vicinity of the source. In the contour plot on the right hand side, one sees that
the wave is located in the area between the two bright circles.
For larger times, at t = 128, the wave separates in two independent contributions propagating in opposite directions along the radial coordinate r. While one
of the waves moves outwards towards increasing r-values the other wave propagates inwards, as indicated by the two arrows in the left ﬁgure. Note that the
amplitude decreases in magnitude with increasing r-values as a result of larger
surface elements r dr dϕ. At t = 270, it is seen that only the ingoing wave can
be found inside the computational region as the outgoing one passes the artiﬁcial boundary ar r = R without any reﬂection. On the other hand, the ingoing
wave propagating towards smaller r-values changes its sign and the direction of
propagation after encountering the margin r< of the inner circle. As a result, for
larger times (t = 450) this wave propagates towards the margin of the computational domain but with opposite sign. Finally, for even larger times this wave
passes the artiﬁcial boundary at r = R without any reﬂection. Thus, for t = 900
the computational region is seen to be completely unperturbed and, as a result
of the boundary condition, the artiﬁcial boundary appears perfectly transparent
to the wave as there is no spurious reﬂection.

Concluding Remarks

We investigate exact nonreﬂecting boundary conditions that are local in time for
the acoustic wave equation in two and three dimensions. The present approach
is based on a separation of variables combined with recurrence relations that
provide a very direct derivation of the boundary condition. This formulation
can be expected to have applications to situations where other methods are
diﬃcult to apply or even impracticable. By adopting an alternative point of
view for attacking such problems, the present methodology complements the
integral transform approach, thus extending and enhancing the strength of the
theory for deriving exact nonreﬂecting boundary conditions.
The derived boundary condition requires only ﬁrst order derivatives of the
solution which makes it relatively easy to use in explicit schemes. Using ﬁnite differences the time extrapolation of the solution and the calculation of the spatial
derivatives require unknown function values that lie outside the computational
domain. This apparent complication is solved, and by using a simple numerical
example in two dimensions we show how these exterior values can be eliminated.
Finally, we emphasize that the derivation of the boundary condition depends
only on the behaviour in the exterior domain, such that the problem inside the
computational region can be arbitrarily complex, e.g. nonlinear. Furthermore,
as there is no unphysical reﬂection at the artiﬁcial boundary associated with
the computational region, the derived condition ensures perfect transparency
that leads to a long-time stability of the numerical scheme. After this work was
completed we learned about a similar approach used in [9].
