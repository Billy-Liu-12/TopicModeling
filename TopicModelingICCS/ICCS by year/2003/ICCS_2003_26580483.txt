Abstract. The paper is devoted to the circumstantiation of the parameterization method for classical calculus of variation problems corresponding to the non-linear ODEs. The method is based on a ﬁnite parameterization of ”control” functions (ﬁnitely entering in initial system) and on
derivation of the problem functional with respect to control parameters.
The ﬁrst and the second derivatives are calculated with the help of adjoint vector and matrix impulses. The problems of arising degeneration
of gradients and optimality conditions of the ﬁrst order are overcome by
using the Newton method. Results of the solution to degenerate DAEs,
particularly with non-unique solutions, are presented.

Introduction

In the paper [3] the parameterization method (PM) of optimal control problems
was created. This method is based on sequential development of a simple idea to
account that as a rule solutions of real optimal control (OC) or calculus of variation (CV) problems have a rather simple structure and control functions can
be well approximated in some parametric function class, for example, by splines
with moving knots. The PM consists of a ﬁnite-dimensional parameterization
of control functions. The parameterized variational problem becomes a ﬁnitedimensional nonlinear programming (NP) problem whereas its functionals are
deﬁned on phase trajectories. Their ﬁrst and second derivatives on the control
parameters may be eﬀectively calculated with the help of variational techniques
and adjoint variables. By this the problems of optimization and numerical solution of diﬀerential equations are separated. Appropriate parameterization allows
one to obtain a NP problem of lower dimension than one obtained under traditional ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximations.
Another advantage of the PM is a possibility to solve OC and CV problems
with a continuous admissible control without expansion of the phase space. Continuous control is a natural one in optimization problems of economics dynamic
and in variational approach to initial / boundary value problems for diﬀerentialalgebraic equations (DAEs), especially in cases of their essential degeneration,
when the system has diﬀerentiation index [8] more then one or it hasn’t a ﬁnite
index [12].

The paper contains reduction schemes for degenerate DAE to the equivalent basic CV problem. The reduced problems as a rule are the degenerate ones
with respect to the ﬁrst order necessary conditions. Also gradients of reduced
functionals degenerate near optimal values of parameters. However, eﬀective calculation of degenerate optimization problems can be obtained by means of the
second order numerical methods of the Newton type. This general fact was developed for theoretical investigations of degenerate OC problems by R.Gabasov
and F.Kirillova (1971) in [2], where the matrix impulse functions, adjoint to the
second variations of the optimal trajectories, were introduced. In [9] some degenerate CV problems were solved thereby using of the second variation of the
improved trajectory .
We note here the limited experience of using the second order techniques
in variational problems. The PM handles this problem naturally and simply. In
diﬃcult unstable problems one can use some regularization of the initial problem [4].

Problem Statement

Consider the initial / boundary value problem for DAE
x˙ = f (x, u(t)),

(1)

h(x(t), u(t)) = 0,

(2)

with conditions
a(x(0), u(0)) = 0,

b(x(T ), u(T )) = 0.

(3)

Here h(x, u) ∈ R , a(x, u) ∈ R , b(x, u) ∈ R , m1 + m2 = m, n ≤ m ≤ n + r.
Diﬃculties of numerical solution to the problem (1)- (3) appear when the
Jacobi matrix of the ﬁnite subsystem (2)
r

m1

m2

∂h(x(t), u(t))/∂u

(4)

degenerates on the solution {x(t), u(t)}. There are some regular numerical methods for the initial value problem for the DAE (1) which have a ﬁnite index up to
3. However, not every system (1), (2) has a ﬁnite index and a veriﬁcation of this
property is rather a complex procedure in the common case. The most complex
case occurs when the matrix (4) has a variable range on [0, T ] [12].
The problem (1)-(3) is naturally embedded in the class of OC ones with continuous control functions u(t) and can be interpreted as a CV problem. Namely,
the problem (1)-(3) is equivalent to the minimization of the functional
T

J[u] =
0

where

m2 ,

(5)

is the Euclidean norm in Rk , under conditions
x˙ = f (x, u(t)),

a(x(0), u(0)) = 0.

(6)

It can be shown [6], such transform leads to the degenerate CV problem
(5), (6).

The Parameterization Method

Parameterization Method

Introduce a partition of the interval [0, T ]
0 ≡ t0 ≤ t1 ≤ . . . ≤ tN ≡ T,

(7)

and deﬁne a structure of control functions u(t) on subintervals as
uµ (t) = ukµ (t; vµk ),

tk−1 ≤ t < tk ,

k = 1, . . . , N,

µ = 1, . . . , r.

(8)

Here vµk ∈ Rd , as well as tk , are the sought control parameters and ukµ (t, vµk ) are
given in analytical form twice-diﬀerentiable functions. Further v k = (v1k , . . . , vrk ).
Conditions (7), (8) present a class of piece-wise continuous control functions
with a given number of discontinuities. A class of continuous admissible functions
is described by additional conditions uk (tk ; v k ) = uk+1 (tk ; v k+1 ).
Substituting a control (8) in diﬀerential equation (1) we have a solution (its
existing is assumed) depended on control parameters
x(t) = z(t; v 1 , t1 , . . . , v k−1 , tk−1 , v k ),

tk−1 ≤ t < tk .

ϕ(w1 , . . . , wN ) = Φ(z(T ; w1 , . . . , wN −1 , v N )).

(10)

The problem (5), (6) with the parameterized control (8) is reduced to the
ﬁnite- dimensional minimization of the function (10) under time-parameter restrictions (7).
Analytical assumptions made above fulﬁll the conditions of twicediﬀerentiable continuous dependence of the problem (1), (8) solution on parameters, thus

1 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ N.

(12)

These functions are variations of the trajectory (9) on the control parameters.
Variations corresponding to parameters v k are solutions of the DE system
y˙ kµα =

∂f (x(t), u(t)) kµα

with trivial initial conditions y kµα (tk−1 ) = 0. Here the Heaviside function θ(t) =
0 for t ≤ 0 and θ(t) = 1 for t > 0. Variations corresponding to the knots tk , i.e.
functions y k00 (t), are deﬁned on [tk , T ] by the similar homogeneous DE system

486

V.K. Gorbunov and I.V. Lutoshkin

with initial condition y k00 (tk ) = f (x(tk ), uk (tk ; v k ))−f (x(tk ), uk+1 (tk ; v k+1 )). If
admissible controls are continuous, then the right hand of the condition equals
to zero, correspondingly, y k00 (t) ≡ 0.
So, one can calculate the derivatives (11) and apply the gradient method
for the ﬁnite-dimensional minimization problem. However the such scheme is
rather complicated because the number of variations equals the number of control
parameters. It is essentially simpliﬁed via using adjoint functions.

Introduce the Hamilton-Pontrjagin function H(p, x, u) = i=1 pi fi (x, u), the
vector function p(t) on [0, T ] (adjoint one to the ﬁrst variations (12))
p˙ = −

p(T ) =

and the function M (t) = H(p(t), x(t), u(t)).
The ﬁrst derivatives (11) can be calculated [3] by formulas:
∂ϕ(w1 , . . . , wN )

So, in order to calculate the derivatives (11) only one additional Cauchy problem,
deﬁned adjoint function p(t), should be solved.
In the considering case control functions u(t) are continuous hence derivatives
∂ϕ/∂tk , as well as variations y k00 (t), are equal to zero.
The second derivation of (11) yields (0 ≤ µ, ν ≤ r; 0 ≤ α, β ≤ d; 1 ≤

also essentially simpliﬁed via using appropriate adjoint functions. These functions are the matrix impulses Ψ (t) deﬁned in [2] by the problem

These formulas are a particular case of more complicate ones for the class of
piece-wise continuous admissible control [5,11].
So the calculations of the second derivatives (13) require solution of a few
Cauchy problems for the ﬁrst variations y(t) and the adjoint variables p(t), Ψ (t).
It allows ones to apply the Newton method on the base of the penalty function
one for the parameterized functional (10) minimization under conditions (7).
Note, the variational problem (5), (6), corresponding to the initial problem for
DAE (1), can be solved sequentially on suﬃciently small intervals [tk−1 , tk ]. The
control function components ui (t) can be assigned as square or cubic parabolas.
The obtained control will be a polynomial spline.

Numerical Example

Example 1. Let’s consider on the interval [0; T ] a DAE ([10]1 )
x˙ 1 = 10t exp(5u2 (t) − 1)x2 (t),

x˙ 2 = −2t ln(u1 (t)),
(E1)

u1 (t) = x1 (t)1/5 ,
1

On the base of an example from [8].

u2 (t) = x22 (t) + u22 (t) /2.

488

V.K. Gorbunov and I.V. Lutoshkin

One of this nonlinear system’s solutions is
x
¯1 (t) = exp(5 sin(t2 )),

x
¯2 (t) = cos(t2 ),
(E2)

u
¯1 (t) = exp(sin(t2 )),

u¯2 (t) = sin(t2 ) + 1.

We state here the initial problem corresponding to the solution. Moreover, it is
desire to construct numerically all solutions on the interval under given T .
This problem is a base test in some articles of the author [10], but on the
interval [1.0708712; 1.423836]. The cause is in degeneration of the Jacobi matrix
of the ﬁnite subsystem
1
0
0 1 − u2 (t)
in points√tk where u2 (t) = 1. Such points, corresponding to the solution (E2),
are tk = kπ (k = 0, 1, ...).
Solutions of (E1) bifurcate at the points and the system isn’t reducible to
normal Cauchy form on corresponding intervals, i.e. it isn’t a ﬁnite index system
and it can’t be solved by known methods developed for DAE of ﬁnite index,
particularly, by the methods of [10], assigned to DAE of index one.
The character of degenerating the second ﬁnite restriction points at existing
two implicit functions u±
1 − x22 at a vicinity of initial conditions
2 (x2 ) = 1 ±
x2 (0) = 1, u2 (0) = 1. So, at the initial point two solution are generated.
To construct numerically two solutions, introduce the functional
T

(u2 (t) − (x22 (t) + u22 (t))/2)2 +

Jα [u] =

(E3)

(x1 (t)1/5 − u1 (t))2 + α(u2 (t) − z(t))2 dt.
Here α ≥ 0, z(t) is a trial function presented a priori properties of the solution
component u2 (t). Consider the problem to minimize (E3) under restrictions
x˙ 1 = 10t exp(5u2 (t) − 1)x2 ,
x1 (0) = x2 (0) = 1.

x˙ 2 = −2t ln(u1 (t)),

(E4)

This problem is equivalent to the initial one under α = 0 and if α > 0 it
approximates a solution of (E1) which has the component u2 (t) similar to z(t).
Having such solution depending on α we use it as initial approximation for a
repeating minimization (E3) under α = 0.
The problem (E3), (E4) was solved such a way with T = 0.5, z(t) = 1+sin(t)
and z(t) = 1 − sin(t) consequently on 5 equal intervals [0; 0.1], . . . , [0.4; 0.5].
Every problem was solved in the class of square parabolic ”controls” ui (t). The
corresponding Cauchy problems were integrated by the 4-th order Runge-Kutta
method with step 0.001.
At the case z(t) = 1 + sin(t) the obtained approximation (x+ , u+ ) of solution
(E2) provides J0 [u+ ] = 4.7 × 10−11 and maximal coordinate deviations are
correspondingly (4.7 × 10−5 ; 8.4 × 10−7 ; 3.9 × 10−5 ; 2.1 × 10−4 ).

At the case z(t) = 1 − sin(t) there was obtained another approximation
(x− , u− ) with unknown analytical expression. Here J0 [u− ] = 1.6 × 10−10 . The

on the interval [0; 1], with the initial condition x(0) = (1, 1, 1, 1)T , corresponding
to the solution
x(t) = (1, 1, 1, 1)T exp(t).
On the [0; 1] the matrix A(t) has a variable range, which equals zero (t = 0)
or three (t > 0). Well-known methods are inapplicable for this problem. In the
paper [12] the problem of solution existence for such kind degenerate (singular)
equations was considered. In the [1] an analogous problem was numerically solved
by the special collocation-diﬀerence method on the interval [1; 2].
The considered DE problem is linear and the initial problem was solved by
the normal spline collocation method in the [7] on the [0; 1]. To solve this problem
on the [0; 1] by the parameterization method it was reduced to VC problem:
x˙ = u(t),
with initial condition x(0) = (1, 1, 1, 1)T and minimizing the functional
T

J(u; t0 , T ) =

A(t)u(t) − B(t)x(t) − f (t)

2

dt,

t0

where t0 = 0, T = 1.
Clearly, the functional J(u; t0 , T ) is additive, so it can be solved consequently
on the partial intervals [tk , tk+1 ], which are a partition of the interval [t0 , T ]. Here
the functionals J(u; tk , tk+1 ) are minimized consequently.
The initial problem was solved consequently on the ﬁve equal intervals
[0; 0, 2], [0, 2; 0, 4], . . . , [0, 8; 1, 0] by two ways. In the ﬁrst way it was used square
parabolas for the approximation of the control u(t):
ui (t) = ai ∗ t2 + bi ∗ t + ci ,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

490

V.K. Gorbunov and I.V. Lutoshkin

In the second way exponential functions
ui (t) = ai ∗ exp(bi ∗ t),

i = 1, 2, 3, 4,

were used.
The Cauchy problems were integrated by the second order Runge-Kutta
method. The corresponding NP problems were solved at ﬁrst by the gradient
method, then by the Newton one. The obtained errors (the maximum deviation
of components on the integration net) for diﬀerent steps of integration h are
presented in the table 1.
Table 1.

0, 018
way 2 4.0 × 10−4 2.6 × 10−5 2, 4 × 10−8

These results show the importance of using of adequate a priori representation of seeking solution. Besides we should mark paradoxical increase of an error
with a diminution of an integration step in the way 1. It can be explained by
accumulation of round-oﬀ errors, as the usual arithmetic of double precision was
used.

Conclusion

So, these examples demonstrate a capacity for applying the parameterization
method of the second order in the standard form for solving singular DE problems. Success of the PM application to degenerate DA systems can be explained
by picking out the regular diﬀerential subsystem and ﬁxing the structure of the
control solution components on the integration intervals. Moreover, these intervals are more much then a step of a diﬀerence scheme that was applied to the
regular Cauchy problems.
