Abstract. This paper concerns numerical convergence studies of the general nth order stochastic perturbation technique applied frequently to randomize some
boundary value of boundary initial problems in computational mathematics as
well as to additionally modify numerical methods in engineering. The general
scheme of the technique is introduced and invented in terms of the coupled
viscous fluid dynamics problem. Symbolic mathematics package MAPLE and
its visualization tools are engaged to perform computational studies on
convergence of the first two probabilistic moments for the simple unidirectional
Couette Newtonian fluid flow. The methodology and its implementations need
many further improvements, however their efficient applications in various
engineering problems are possible now.

Introduction

Various stochastic computational techniques have been implemented until now using
both theoretical and computational methods, i.e. stochastic spectral approaches, some
Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) techniques [3,5] and various numerical realizations of
the perturbation technique [6,7]. As it is known, the usage, precision and
computational implementation algorithms strongly depend on the input random fields
types, their correlation functions as well as the interrelations between the first few
probabilistic moments. Some of those issues are raised in the paper in terms of the
Gaussian input inserted in the boundary value problem with random parameters being
solved by the stochastic perturbation method. This method applied frequently in its
second order moment version has the well-known limitations on the input coefficients
of variation and that is why the traditional approach is extended to the sixth order
technique.
Convergence of the perturbation method is discussed next using a simple symbolic
computations comparison of second, fourth and sixth order approximation of the
expected values with deterministic solution for a simple test problem for the random
output being inversion of the Gaussian variable. It shows that widely discussed in the
literature convergence of perturbation technique applications strongly depends on the
transformation type between the output and input random variables. Further numerical
studies especially of comparative nature with another stochastic methods are
necessary – improved Monte-Carlo analyses of analogous flow problems to establish

the most efficient perturbation orders for various input and perturbation parameters
(to be performed using the FEM [1,2] package ANSYS, for instance) and theoretical
analysis for the non-Gaussian variables as well.

General Stochastic Perturbation Technique

Let us introduce the random vector by b r (x ) and its probability density functions by
p(br) and p(br,bs), respectively, for r,s=1,...,R, where R represents the total number of
different input random fields. Then, the first two probabilistic moments of b r (x ) are
defined by [9]

E[br ] ≡ b0r =

and

The basic idea of the stochastic perturbation approach is to expand all input
variables and all the state functions of the given problem via Taylor series about their
spatial expectations using some small parameter ψ>0. For example, in case of random
parameter ρ the following expression is employed:

ρ = ρ 0 + ψρ ,r ∆b r +

where

Adopting perturbation parameter ψ as equal to 1 and eliminating higher than the

If higher order terms are necessary (because of a great random deviation of the
input random variable about its expected value), then the following extension can be
proposed:

E[f (t , b R ); b R ] =
= 1× f 0 ( t , b R ) + 12 × f ,rs ( t , b R ) × Cov(b r , b s )

when all terms with the odd orders are equal to 0 for the Gaussian random deviates.
Thanks to such an extension of the random output, any desired efficiency of the
expected values as well as higher probabilistic moments can be achieved by the
appropriate choice of the parameters m and ψ corresponding to the input probability
density function (PDF) type, probabilistic moments interrelations, acceptable error of
the computations etc. This choice can be made by comparative studies with the long
(almost infinite) series Monte-Carlo simulations or theoretical results obtained from
the direct symbolic integration.
Similar considerations for the second order expansion only lead to the following
result on the cross-correlations of any state function:

An Application to the Computational Fluid Dynamics
Problems

Let us consider for illustration a viscous incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid in
the domain Ω, which can be written as the standard Navier-Stokes formulas

 ∂v

ρ i + v i, j v j  = σ ij, j + f iB
 ∂t


(14)

v i ,i = 0

(15)

σ ij = −pδ ij + 2µε ij where ε ij =

1
2

(v i, j + v j,i )

(16)

The state variables v i , ε ij , σ ij denote velocity of the fluid, components of velocity
strain and stress tensors, while f iB denote the body force vector components. The
variables ρ, p, µ denote mass density, pressure, and viscosity, correspondingly;
typical boundary conditions for these equations hold for fluid velocities:
(17)

vi = vˆi ; x ∈ ∂Ω v and σ ij n j = fˆi ; x ∈ ∂Ω σ .

A weak variational formulation of the problem follows on integration by parts in the
weighted residual integral statement with the stress and velocity boundary conditions.
Inserting the stochastic expansion of all input parameters and the state functions and
equating the same order terms, the following coupled equations are obtained:

It is necessary to multiply each of these equations by the n order probabilistic
moments of the input random variables or fields to get the algebraic form convenient
for any symbolic computations. Because of a great complexity of such a solution, the
second order perturbation approach is usually preferred. Recursive derivation of the
particular perturbation order equilibrium equations can be powerful in conjunction
with symbolic packages with automatic differentiation tools only; it can extend the
area of stochastic perturbation technique applications in computational physics and
engineering outside the random processes with small dispersion about their expected
values. Hence, there is no need to implement directly exact formulas for a particular
th
k order equations extracted from the perturbation – they can be symbolically
generated in the system MAPLE, and next converted to the FORTRAN or C++ source
codes of the relevant computer software; there has been no software available until
now to demonstrate any numerical illustrations in that area. Finally, it should be
emphasized that the random input variables must express here the uncertainty in space
or in time, separately.

Deterministic values are compared against the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth
order perturbation based approximation of the expected values for U=10.0, E[h]=2.0
and its coefficient of variation equal to 0.1 and collected in Fig. 1 for the entire fluid
flow domain, whereas for y → h in Fig. 2.

The test function is good illustration because it has infinite number of nonzero
partial derivatives with respect to the random input parameter, so that each new
perturbation order introduces new components into the probabilistic output. In case of
linear or even polynomial transformation between output and input the differences
between various perturbation-based approximations monotonously and systematically
decrease. Another visible aspect is that we can speed up the effectiveness of the
stochastic Taylor expansion through decreasing of the perturbation parameter ψ value
what needs separate further detailed computational studies. Generally, it can be
concluded that the application of polynomial transformation can be successful even in
case of the second order approximation with unitary perturbation parameter, whereas
in case of random input in denominator the convergence is very slow and that is why
it is recommended to reduce the expansion coefficient ψ after some analogous
probabilistic computational convergence studies.

Analogously to the previous considerations, the formula for 6 order perturbation
variance of a single random variable v in terms of the Gaussian random input given
by h is introduce. There holds

Including here eqns (27), the second order probabilistic moment of the variable v
can be determined as a function of the relevant partial derivatives of v with respect to
U as well as its expected value and variance. The relevant results are collected in Figs.
3 and 4 in case of standard deviations and the coefficients of variations computed for
the second, fourth and sixth order stochastic expansions of the basic solutions.

Computational results presented in Figs. 1-4 show that the differences between the
stochastic perturbation-based solutions sequential orders decrease together with the
increasing order of the applied perturbation. This convergence is obtained for
symmetric and very specific random input and generally depends on numerous
stochastic perturbation parameters what should be verified next in details.

It should be emphasized that, in contrast to the stochastic simulation method, the
th
stochastic n order perturbation nth moment analysis makes it possible to derive
th
probabilistic moments of the state functions up to n order only; higher order
expansion is necessary to calculate higher order probabilistic moments from the
perturbation-based solution.

Concluding Remarks
th

The comparison between the second and higher as well as the generalized n order
perturbation stochastic second moment approach is demonstrated theoretically and
verified numerically in case of some viscous incompressible fluid flow with some
input random parameter. As it is shown in the symbolic computations, the stochastic
convergence of this methodology strongly depends on the character of the
transformation between input and output random functions. In case when infinite
number of partial derivatives of the output with respect to the input random variable
exists, this convergence can be speeded up by some additional reduction of the
perturbation parameter. It may be precisely established using some further numerical
tests where the analytical solution of a similar nature is available.
The appropriate FEM (or similar techniques [6]) implementations [1,2] can be
th
proposed according to the general n order perturbation approach proposed. Higher
order probabilistic approaches for the general random deviates (as the Weibull Second
Order Third Moment) can be applied in all those cases where the asymmetry about
the expectations cannot be neglected; further mathematical and numerical studies on
other type than Taylor expansions are also necessary. On the other hand, the
symbolic-numeric PDE-solvers developments would substantially increase the
stochastic perturbation method applications in the applied sciences and engineering.
