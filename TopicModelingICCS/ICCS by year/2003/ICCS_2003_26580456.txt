Abstract. An approach enabling to reduce computational expenses at
pseudogradient estimation of image parameters based on control of goal
function local sample volume is proposed. Local sample volume variation during the process of parameter estimation occurs automatically in
correspondence with a preassigned criterion, for instance, sample correlation coeﬃcient. It is shown that for the problems of image mutual
spatial deformation parameter estimation, computational expenses can
be reduced several times as many.

Introduction

For remote exploration of the Earth, in medicine, geology and navigation information extraction systems with embedded spatial apertures of signal sensors
are becoming more and more popular. Such systems contain initial data in the
form of dynamic arrays with proper feature which is in their space-time correlation and due to this they can be represented in the form of multidimensional
images(MI).
When developing algorithmic software of MI processing it is necessary to
take into account the dynamics of the scene to be observed, spatial movements
of the signal sensors and imperfection of their construction. The inﬂuence of the
mentioned factors can be described through mathematical models of space-time
deformations of multidimensional grids with assigned image. The estimation of
the varying parameters of spatial deformations (SD) is required at automated
search of a fragment on image, navigational tracking of the mobile object course
in the conditions of limited visibility, combination of multidomain images at
remote explorations of the Earth, in medical explorations and other problems.
A great number of scientiﬁc publications are devoted to the aspects of image
space-time deformation parameter estimation. In the present work ways of computational expense reduction when using pseudogradient procedures to solve this
problem are considered.
Let us assume that the model of MI SD is deﬁned with accuracy of parameters vector α
¯ and estimation quality criterion α
¯ is formulated in terms of some
functional J(¯
α) minimization showing expected losses. However it is impossible
to ﬁnd the optimal parameters α
¯ ∗ in the appointed sense in view of incompleteness of MI description. In this case the parameters α
¯ can be estimated on the

minimizes J(¯

avoid this intermediate stage of exploration and determine α

by the necessity of multiple cumbersome calculations of ∇J(¯
αt−1 , Z). It is possible to essentially decrease the volume of calculations if instead of ∇J(¯

αt−1 , Zt ) at some part Zt of the realization
we use its contraction ∇Qt = ∇J(¯
choosing, for example, in the capacity of Zt a sliding window. The analysis of
the approaches [2-5] to the synthesis of large MI SD estimation procedures in
real time showed that the algorithms satisfying the requirements of simplicity,
fast convergence and capacity to work in various real situations are reasonable
to seek in the class of recurrent non-identiﬁcation adaptive algorithms and the
most representative group of these algorithms constitutes pseudogradient algorithms (PGA). The concept of pseudogradient (PG), which was the basis for
development of a uniﬁed approach to the analysis and synthesis of various procedures of functionals stochastic minimization, was introduced by B.T.Polyak and
Y.Z.Tzypkin in work [6] The class of PGA is very wide and includes algorithms
of stochastic approximation, random search and many others.
In PGA the following procedure [1] is used
ˆ¯ t = α

where α
¯ is vector of the parameters to be estimated; Λt is positively deﬁned
matrix usually called ampliﬁcation matrix; β¯t is some random direction in the
ˆ¯ t−1 and on step number t; α
ˆ¯ 0 is
parameter space depending on the values α

initial approximation of the parameters vector. The direction βt will be PG if
ˆ¯ t−1 )]T M {β¯t } ≥ 0 is satisﬁed, i.e. if the vector β¯t makes
the condition [∇J(α
on the average a sharp angle with an exact value of functional gradient. The
algorithm [2] will be considered to be pseudogradient, if β¯t is PG at each its
step. In this case the steps in (2) are performed on average in the direction of
ˆ¯ ) and sequence α

We should mention that in the algorithm (2) a possibility of calculation of

When synthesizing PGA for an assigned goal function (GF) it is necessary to
derive some easily calculated PG. Below computational expense reduction ways
are considered when designing PG.

Algorithms with Varying Local Sample Size

In a number of cases the problem of identiﬁcation (recognition) with decisive
rule based on GF values is solved together with the problem of SD estimation.
In particular, when searching a fragment position on supporting image, having
in relation with the supporting image in addition to SD close to linear brightness distortions, excess of some value of sample correlation coeﬃcient between
fragment and supporting image can serve as the criterion of correspondence. In
this case for obtaining high conﬁdential probability a large volume µ of GF local
sample is required which can not prove itself in the process of convergence of
the estimates α
¯ . In such situations it is reasonable to use varying µ, the value of
which is regulated automatically during the process of PG algorithm operation
and is minimal for some criterion attainment at each iteration. Let us consider
an example of such PGA maximizing ICSC and which showed high eﬃciency
when solving the problem of fragment search on a supporting image. Another
example is considered in work [9].

As an example let us present the results obtained when solving the problem
of fragment position search on real images of the optical range (with correlation
interval approximately equal to 5 steps of sample grid). On ﬁg.2 the dependence
of GF local sample size µ on the unbalance εc of a fragment centre true position
averaged on 800 realizations and its estimations under contrast of fragment scale
to a reference image by 25%, slewing angle , slewing angle ϕ = 30◦ and initial
unbalance εc = 12 (curve 1, experimental data is asterisks). It is clearly seen that
µ increases only at relatively small εc . On the same ﬁgure dependence of iteration
number t on εc is shown. The circles correspond to mean iteration numbers
averaged on 800 realizations, curve 3 represents the mathematical expectation of
iteration number calculated on the basis of the strategy [10]. It is seen that there
is good correspondence between experimental and analytical results (circles and
curve 3). In this case Gaussian image model with Gaussian correlation function
(CF) with signal variance to noise variance ratio equal to 0.01 was used. The
algorithm parameters and initial approximations of the parameters vector are
consistent with the experimental ones.
Curve 2 is consistent with the iteration number mathematical expectation
for the situation of µ = const = 250 . The algorithm with µ = 250 obtains
M {εc } = 0.3 in 580 iterations. The algorithm with varying µ aﬀords the same
quality of estimation at 930 iterations (curve 2), but computer time expenses
prove to be 9,6 times less.

Conclusion

The algorithms of multidimensional images sequences spatial deformations parameters estimation developed on the basis of pseudogradient non-identiﬁcation
procedures have high accuracy of estimates to be formed and fast speed of calculation and can be recommended for application in real-time systems. At absence
of image brightness distortions it is expedient to choose interframe diﬀerence
mean square as a goal function and at interframe brightness distortions close
to linear-interframe correlation sample coeﬃcient. When calculating the pseudogradient operations number reduction can be obtained by using goal function
gradient contraction and substitution of deformed frame value prediction with
a simpler estimate through interpolation. Regulation of goal function local sample volume during the algorithm processing enables to essentially reduce computational expenses. In the considered algorithm interframe correlation sample
coeﬃcient was used as a goal function. However the presented principles of development of pseudogradient algorithms with regulated volume of local sample can
be also applied at other goal functions, in particular, mean square of interframe
diﬀerence.
