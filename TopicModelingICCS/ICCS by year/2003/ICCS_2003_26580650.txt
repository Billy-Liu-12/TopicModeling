Abstract. With the help of the empirical mutation table for nucleotides
in the Borrelia burgdorferi genome we have performed Monte Carlo simulation of the pure mutation pressure experienced by the genes of the
genome. We have examined the divergence of the mutated genes from
the ancestral ones and we have constructed MPM1 matrix (Mutation
Probability Matrix) of the substitution rates between amino acids of the
diverging genes. The results have been compared to mutation data matrix PAM1 PET91 representing mutation and selection data of 16130
homologous genes od diﬀerent organisms. We have found that the eﬀective survival time of amino acids in organisms follows a power law with
respect to frequency of their occurrence in genes. This makes possible to
ﬁnd the eﬀect of the pure mutational pressure and the selection on the
amino acid composition of genes. The results are universal in the sense
that the survival time of amino acids calculated from the higher order
PAMk matrices (k > 1) follows the same power law as in the case of
PAM1 matrices.

Introduction

Determining the evolutionary distances between two protein sequences requires
the knowledge of the substitution rates of amino-acids. It is generally accepted
that the more substitutions are necessary to change one sequence into another,
the more unrelated they are and the larger their distance to the common ancestor. The most widely used method for the calculation of distances between
sequences is based on the mutation data matrix, Mij , published by Dayhoﬀ et
al. [1], where i, j represent amino acids, and an element Mij of the matrix gives

the probability that the amino acid in column j will be replaced by the amino
acid in row i after a given evolutionary time interval. The interval corresponding
to 1 percent of substitutions between two compared sequences is called one PAM
(Percent of Accepted Mutations), and the corresponding matrix is denoted as
PAM1 matrix. There is assumed a Markov model of sequence evolution and a
simple power M k of the PAM1 matrix (multiplied by itself k times) denotes a
matrix, PAMk, that gives the amino acid substitution probability after k PAMs.
Today, a much more accurate PAM matrix is available, generated from 16130
protein sequences, published by Jones et al. [2]. The large number of compared
genes guarantees that the matrix has negligible statistical errors and it can be
considered to be the reference matrix during the calculations of the phylogenetic
distances. The matrix is also known as PET91 matrix.
Recently, by comparing intergenic sequences being remnants of coding sequences with homologous sequences of genes, we have constructed an empirical
table of the nucleotide substitution rates in the case of the leading DNA strand
of the B. burgdorferi genome [3],[4],[5]. We have found that substitution rates,
which determine the evolutionary turnover time of a given kind of nucleotide
in third codon positions of coding sequences, are highly correlated with the frequency of the occurrence of that nucleotide in the sequences. There is a compositional bias produced by replication process, introducing long-range correlation
among nucleotides in the third positions in codons, which is very similar to the
bias seen in the intergenic sequences [6].
We have used the empirical table of nucleotide substitution rates to simulate mutational pressure on the genes lying on the leading DNA strand of the
B.burgdorferi genome and we have constructed MPM1 matrix (Mutation Probability Matrix) for amino acid substitutions in the evolving genes. Thus the
resulting table represents the percent of amino acid substitutions introduced by
mutational pressure and not by selection. Next, we compared the survival times
of the amino acids in the case without any selection with the eﬀective survival
times of the amino acids, counted with the help of the PAM1 PET91 matrix.

Mutation Table for Nucleotides

DNA sequence of the B.burgdorferi genome was downloaded from the website
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The empirical mutation table for nucleotides in third positions in codons, which we used in the paper, is the following [3],[4]:


1 − uWA u WAT u WAG u WAC
 u WT A 1 − uWT u WT G u WT C 

M =
(1)
 u WGA u WGT 1 − uWG u WGC 
u WCA u WCT u WCG 1 − uWC
where

1

WGA = 0.0667 WGT = 0.0347 WGC = 0.0470 WAG = 0.1637
WAT = 0.0655 WAC = 0.0702 WT G = 0.1157 WT A = 0.1027
WT C = 0.2613 WCG = 0.0147 WCA = 0.0228 WCT = 0.0350

The transpose matrix convention has been chosen in [3].

and the elements of the matrix give the probability that nucleotide in column j
will mutate to the nucleotide in row i during one replication cycle. The symbols
Wij represent relative substitution probability of nucleotide j by nucleotide i, and
u represents mutation rate. The symbols Wj in the diagonal represent relative
substitution probability of nucleotide j:
Wj =

Wij ,

(3)

i=j

and
WA + WT + WG + WC = 1.

(4)

The expression for the mean survival time of the nucleotide j depends on Wj
as follows (derivation can be found in [3])
τj = −

1
1
≈
.
ln(1 − u Wj )
u Wj

(5)

The above approximated formula is true for small values of the mutation rate u.
In papers [3],[4],[5], we concluded that in a natural genome the frequency
of occurrence fj of the nucleotides, in the third position in codons, is linearly
related to the respective mean survival time τj ,
fj = m0 τj + c0 ,

(6)

with the same coeﬃcients, m0 and c0 , for each nucleotide. The Kimura’s neutral
theory [7] of evolution assumes the constancy of the evolution rate, where the
mutations are random events, much the same as the random decay events of
the radioactive decay. However, the linear law in (6) is not contrary to the
Kimura’s theory. Still, the mutations represent random decay events but they
are correlated with the DNA composition.

Mutational Pressure MPM1 Matrix Construction for
Amino Acids

In order to compare an eﬀect of the pure mutational pressure and the selection
pressure on amino acid composition of genes we used the results of Monte Carlo
simulation of the mutational pressure applied on 564 genes from the leading
DNA strand of the B. burdorferi genome. This enabled us to calculate amino
acid substitution rates which, next we could compare with the ones originating
from the PAM1 PET91 substitution rates matrix [2]. The way, the experimental PET91 matrix has been constructed, determined our simulation algorithm,
which consisted of the following steps:
(i)

for each gene, considered to be an ancestral one, make two copies of the
gene at t = 0,
(ii) increase time step t (t = t + 1) and with frequency u mutate nucleotides of
the two gene copies with the probability distribution deﬁned by the elements
of the mutation matrix in (1),

Correlation between Mutation Pressure, Selection Pressure

653

(iii) goto (ii) unless the number of amino acid substitutions between the homologous protein sequences reaches 1%,
The applied value of the mutation pressure was u = 0.01. The steps (i)–(iii)
have been repeated 105 times in order to calculate the averaged values of the
substitution rates between the homologous protein sequences. These values we
used to construct a mutation probability matrix MPM1 according to the procedure of Dayhoﬀ et al.[1] and Jones et al. [2]. The resulting mutation table, with
substitution probabilities Mij , the amino acid mutability mj , and the fraction
fj of amino-acid in the compared sequences have been presented, respectively,
in Table 1 and Table 2.
The elements Mij of the MPM1 matrix in Table 1 have been scaled with the
parameter λ, which related them to the evolutionary distance of one percent of
substitutions and it is equal to 0.00009731 in our simulations.

Discussion of Results

The major qualitative diﬀerence between the MPM matrix introduced in the
previous section and the PAM1 PET91 matrix published in the paper by Jones
et al.[2] is that the ﬁrst one is a result of pure mutational pressure whereas the
second one is a result of both mutational and selection pressures. Thus, we have
two evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the resulting PAM matrices.
With the help of formula (5) (extended to amino acids) we have calculated
eﬀective survival times of amino acids in the case of the MPM1 matrix (Table
1) and the mutational/selectional PAM1 PET91 matrix ([2]). The value of the
parameter λ is a counterpart of u in (5). In Fig.1, we presented the relation
between the calculated survival time o amino acids and their fractions in the B.
burgdorferi proteins, in the pairs of diverged genes, in a log-log scale. One can
observe that the data are highly correlated and in both cases the dependence of
the mean survival time of amino acid on the fraction of the amino acid represents
a power law:
τj ∼ Fjα
(7)
with a negative value of α ≈ −1.3 in the case of selection and a positive value of
α ≈ 0.2 in the case of mutation pressure on the leading DNA strand of the B.
burgdorferi genome. The value of α for the analogous mutational PAM1 matrix
calculated in the case of the lagging DNA strand of the B. burgdorferi genome
is about twice as small. It is worth to underline that the slopes α are the same
for the matrices PAMk with high values of k, and thus, they are universal with
respect to evolution.
In Fig.1 we may observe a kind of evolutional scissors acting on amino acids.
Once the less frequent amino acids, like W (tryptophane), C (cysteine), have
much shorter turn over time compared with other amino acids (as can be seen
from the lower line) the selection pressure (upper line) counteracts with the
eﬀect. On the other hand, the most mutable amino acids, like L (leucine) or I
(isoleucine) , which are very frequent in genes, seem to be much weakly inﬂuenced
by selection.

In genes the fraction of the amino acids most protected by selection strongly
depends on gene size, it is diminishing when gene’s size is increasing. The eﬀect
weakens if we go into right the direction of the evolutionary scissors in Fig.1. To
show this, we ordered all 564 genes under consideration with respect to fraction
of an examined amino acid and the genes have been assigned a rank number.
Next, we plotted the dependence of both the gene size on the rank and the
dependence of the amino acid fraction in the gene on the rank. The resulting plots
in Figs.2 correspond to two evolutionary extreme cases, representing tryptophan
and leucine. It is evident that in the case of tryptophan the fraction of that amino
acid in genes is anti-correlated with the gene’s size (notice, that about 1/3 genes
do not posses tryptophan). In the case of leucine there is a crossover and the
eﬀect of selection is evident only for the genes which have more than 10% of
that amino acid. When the fraction of leucine is less than 10% there is even a
reverse eﬀect, i.e., the increasing fraction is correlated with the increasing gene’s
size. If we look at the evolutionary scissors in Fig.1, we can see that in the case
of leucine the survival time, which originates from pure mutational pressure is
longer than its selectional counterpart. Recently, there has appeared a paper by
Xia and Li [8] discussing which amino acid properties (like polarity, isoelectric
point, volume etc.) aﬀect protein evolution. Thus, there is a possibility to relate
these properties to our discussion of the evolutionary scissors.

Conclusions

With the help of computer simulations of the mutational pressure experienced
by genes in the B.burgdorferi genome we have shown that the amino acids which
experience the highest selectional pressure have the shortest turn over time with
respect to mutation pressure. The fraction of these amino acids in genes depends
on the gene’s size. Much diﬀerent is the selectional role of the amino acids, like
leucine, from the right hand side of the selectional scissors. Although they have
long turn over time with respect to the mutational pressure, their fraction cannot
be too high. This could be considered as an eﬀect of optimisation of the genetic
information on coding with processes of mutagenesis and phenotype selection
for protein functions.
