1 Introduction
Co mplex networks (CN) is a class of comp lex system models which describes the dynamical set of
objects with time varying links, which are capable to define in probabilistic terms (Newman, 2003).
There are a lot of applicat ions of CN in real-world systems such as: science communities (Redner,
1998), WWW (Broder, Ku mar, & Maghoul, 2000), infection spreading (Sloot & Ivanov, 2008) etc.
Problem of static CN exp loration and modeling had been studied rather well (Garlaschelli & Loffredo,
2008), but the investigations of CN dynamics are still open due to various physical principles of CN
evolution. This paper is devoted to application of CN model to tackle specific problem — search and
rescue (SAR) operations at sea. Drifting floaters are one of the major subjects of SAR operations. One
option is a rescue of lost vessels’ crew members. Short term drifting and visibility are important
factors for such kind of rescue operations. Another option is a search for lifeboats, washed off
containers (Daniel, Jan, Cabioc’h, Landau, & Loiseau, 2002) , (Ku magai, Oda, & Fujii, 2006) and
buoys that experience an anchor failure, or even World War II mines. Such drift ing objects are
hazardous for shipping. Long term drifting (A illiot, Frenod, & Monbet, 2006) is an important factor
for predicting their trajectories. Spotted object drifters are candidates for rescue (lifeboats, buoys,
containers) or eliminat ion (mines). Short term predict ion is also required especially in case of bad
weather conditions. (Spaulding, Isaji, Hall, & Allen, 2006) studied a method of marit ime SA R
operation based on particle models. (Breivik Ø. , Allen, Maisondieu, & Roth, 2011) describes the
problem fo r such kind of objects taking into account waves, wind and currents. So me re searchers

studied drifter's behavior applied to the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea (Breivik & A llen, 2008), the
Gu lf of Finland (Gästgifvars, et al., 2006) and the Flemish Cap (Ross, 1981). These researches
consider the collective behavior of floating drifters as the separate problem. The collective behavior
may be caused not only by physical lin ks (such as ropes or cables), but also by the limits of sight
(visual, radio etc.) between two neighboring drifters. Thus, the model of dynamic CN seems natural
for the problem statement.
This work introduces the CN model for collective behavior of floating drifters. Direct simu lation
method for floating objects on irregular sea is used to exp ress network dynamics. We have applied our
method to standard ISO containers that were washed off and swept over by the waves. The features of
their collect ive behavior (such as network destruction) are considered. The model is also applied to
study the efficiency of SAR planes at sea.

2 Problem Statement
Let's consider the several floating drifters V (ISO containers lost at sea). Each drifter can be v isible
within a given range. The lines of sight E between drifters form a CN of d rifters. This network evolves
in time since each drifter has s tochastic position and orientation and waves affect these objects in
different ways with non-constant forces (see Figure 1a).

The set (V, E) fo rms CN that evolves in time. Init ially the structure of CN may be rather regular,
but at later time the network structure is in destruction due to irregular wind, wave and current loads
(see Figure 1b).
Generally, the evolution of CN (V, E) may be defined in terms of evolutionary operator Γ:
(V , E , :) t 1

*(V , E , :) t ,

(V , E , :) t 0

(V0 , E 0 , : 0 ).

(1)

Here : is the probabilistic measure which is defined by the stochastic behavior of CN, where
index “0” is the init ial state. There are several approaches to define Γ. In (Sloot & Ivanov, 2008) the
evolutionary operator reflects the infection spreading inside the CN, in (Kashirin & Dijkstra, 2013) —
the formal structure of optimization process. But in this case the nature of Γ is conditioned by the
external loads (wind, wave and current forces). Thus it allows us to apply the direct simu lation of
floating drifters to identify the structure and behavior of CN over the time.

3 Simulation Method
Below we consider only the sea wave loads in evolutionary operator in (1). This operator acts on
every node V of CN: the coordinates of the nodes are changing every time step. Thus, the links break
when the distance between nodes are greater than the sight limit. When the was out of sight again
(which it is possible due to periodicity of wave mot ion), the links restore. It should be noted that we
have considered only the wave load. Wind and tidal currents are not taken into account .

3.1 Simulation Model of Irregular Waves
The used model defines the sea surface by superposition of a finite nu mber of harmonic waves
(Lopatuhin, 2004). The disturbance of waves is determined by a two-dimensional disturbance energy
spectrum ܵሺ߱ǡ ߠሻ, where ߱ — the angular frequency of the wave and ߠ — the angle between the
direction of the running wave and wind direction. There are various models of the spectra of
disturbance exp ressed in terms of the energy density function of the angular frequency and direction of
propagation (Lopatuhin, 2004). An example of such a spectrum is a spectrum of Pierson-Moskowitz:

where ݉ – even number which defines the power of narrowness of s ea waves, ߱௠௔௫ — the peak
frequency of the spectrum and ߙ ൌ ͲǤͲͲͺͳ.
In practice, the continuous spectrum of d isturbance can be approximated by a fin ite number of
harmonics. In o rder to p rovide a quick generation of harmonic heights and velocities, the t wodimensional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used.
The energy spectrum should be rep resented as a function of the wave vector of k–harmonic in
case of using FFT.

where ߛ — the bulk density of water. According to this formu la, the longer the wavelength, the
damped oscillation of the particles is slower as the depth increases.
Since ߛ݁ ȁ௞ȁ௭ depends on the wave number, then to take this outside of the sum is impossible that
leads into question the applicability of the FFT to determine the pressure at each depth.

To determine the accuracy of this assumption we had estimated the pressure values at different
depths. For this we found the standard deviation of the pressure values at different depths (d = 0.16 m)
for different frequencies of the peak maximu m ߱௠௔௫ . Calculation shows that the error does not exceed
10%.
The same way we get the planar displacement and velocit ies of the water part icles among water
volume. These attributes are used for approximate computation of dynamics of floating objects.

3.2 Simulation Model of Floating Object Dynamics on Irregular Waves
To build a model of d istribution of fo rces and torques acting, the naval object is considered as a
rigid body with 6 degrees of freedom:
݉‫ܘ‬ሷ ൌ ۴

۸૑ሶ ൌ ‫ۻ‬

(3)

where ݉ - the su m of the mass displacement of the floating object and the added mass, ۸ — inert ia
tensor of the vessel and the added mass. Let’s consider the force and torque on the right side of
equations (3). Since nonzero torque is result of nonzero off-center force application, it is sufficient to
consider the following forces acting on the vessel:

The force of gravity applied to the center of gravity and directed downward. Hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic forces of water pressure applied to each point of the hull are located in the water and
directed along the normal to the surface. Damping forces apply to each point of submerged body.
These forces are proportional to relat ive tangential velocity of water particles. Total force and torque
acting on the floating ob ject can be exp ressed as follows (subscript p indicates the pressure forces and
d the damping forces)

where ܵ — the immersed surface of the hull, mg — total gravity force, ‫ — ݌‬hydrostatic and

the surface point in global coordinates, ‫ — ܘ‬the floating object's position in space, ‫ — ܪ‬the
coefficient of viscous resistance, ‫ — ܞ‬the velocity of the water relative to the hull surface element. Fext
and Mext — any additional force and torque caused by external fo rces such as wind and currents that
can be added to extend model.
Analytical calculation o f the exp ressions (4) and (5) is only possible for the ideal shape of hull. As
a consequence, it is necessary to perform nu merical integration at each step. The surface of vessel is
partitioned into ܰ elements whose size is so small that a change of pressure or force along the element
is negligible.
This model is very convenient for using in virtual testbed and for the real-time virtual application
because it allow us to perform simulation of several objects with acceptable accurac y.

4 Numerical Study of Drifting Objects’ Network
Consider the evolution of properties of such networks for g iven sea waves. 25 ISO containers have
been stacked and thrown to the see with the average wave length about 40 meters and narrowness 4 for
the first experiment and 16 for the second one.
See Figure 2 and Figure 3. The first plot shows a total number of network links. Note that for 25
objects total number links for fu ll g raph will be 600. The second plot shows a characteristic spot size
and total maximu m, min imu m and average kinemat ic displacement. These values give us the pictu re
of spatial properties of the spot. The third plot shows the cluster distribution over the time, e.g. time
percentage when network has particular number of disjo int clusters. These numbers represent
clustering stability of the network over time.
Comparing the plots of total network links for visibility range we can see that:
1.
2.
3.

The total network links decrease with time. For examp le, in figure two (top p lot), the total
link number for range 50 m decreases down to 50 links for 2400 seconds.
Period ic phenomena occur due to wave packets. See the top plots — total network links
slightly grow up and fall down within the period of about 100– 120 seconds. Less noticeable
and more frequent oscillations also occur.
Network destruction starts after 0 seconds for 50 meters of visibility range, after
(approximately) 150 second for 100 meters, 600 seconds for 150 meters and 1500 seconds for
both 200 and 250 meters.

Comparing the plots of spot size we can see that:
1.

Spot size grows almost the same for both wave narrowness parameter (m = 4 and m = 16), but
for more narrowed waves spot size grows more irregularly.

Period ic phenomena are mo re noticeable for less narrowed waves — the plot has mo re
noticeable peaks.

The plots of cluster distribution over the time (that are bu ilt for t ime ranges over each 500 seconds)
give us the following conclusions:
1.
2.

Cluster distribution over the t ime is mo re sensitive to wave narrowness than other network
properties.
More narro wed waves keep clustering effect more stable. Co mparing two plots we can see
that histograms are sharper. For examp le, for time range 2000–2400 seven clusters are kept
only 40% of time with m = 4, but almost 80% of time with m = 16.

5 Application: Efficiency of Search Plans for Lost Cargo
Consider the situation when the strong waves wash away cargo from vessel. The cargo is very
expensive and is not ensured. A crew d iscovers a loss of cargo after several minutes and decides to
rescue it; they send a helicopter or motorboat to mark lost containers with beacons. The helicopte r
flies along the main wave direct ion with a constant velocity until some container is spotted (seen
within a given range due to fog or rain). When the helicopter reaches container it will be considered
rescued and helicopter continues the search for another closest visible one or continues to travel along
the main wave direction. See Figure 4.
Initial simulat ion of trajectory of each container is performed for solid body that meets the ISO
standards for containers. They are co lliding and are affected waves. Achieved results are used for
rescue operation simulation. We ran this scenario with given containers' trajectories with various delay
between cargo loss and start of rescue operation, helicopter’s velocities and visibility range. The
number o f rescued containers and rescue time (limited to 40 minutes) are shown on Figure 5. The plot
shows us that high velocity and large visibility range does not guarantee cargo rescue because greedy
algorith m can run into wrong decision that is critical for Travelling Sailsman Problem. It happens
since the distance between each container changes in time (as shown on Figure 2 and Figure 3). There
is no another option, since we don't know exact configuration of the network.

of helicopter or motorboat.

6 Discussion
There are some open topics for discussion, such as comparison of efficiency of the different SA R
strategies, and relation of such strategies to network properties. It is obvious that greedy search can
achieve result faster than a snake-like search pattern, but the greedy search strategy can follow a
wrong way and will never reach all objects or will waste time.
Another problem is a full simu lation of different SAR operation. Each simu lation takes fro m a half
and up to several hours. To achieve a rough stable result it is required to perform several decades of
simu lations with same init ial conditions (velocity of rescue vessel, visibility range and wave sp ectra)
but with different wave realizat ion. Then such simu lation should be performed with variable velocit ies
of rescue vessel and visibility ranges. That falls to thousands of simulations and thousands of hours of
simulation and attempts to use this method to plan particular maritime SAR operations useless.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
We discovered that properties of network of drift ing objects are affected by wave packets. The
simu lation of SAR-operations suggests that the success of SAR operat ions strongly and non-linearly
depends on initial conditions. As mentioned before, a full direct simu lation of SA R operation will take
much t ime and can be useless for practical applications. To break that curse we can use cloud
computing and platforms such as CLA VIRE (Knyazkov, Kovalchuk, & Tchurov, 2012). CLA VIRE
allo ws us to build Workflo ws that are able to gather meteorological data, co mpute wave spectra, run
simulation of object drifting and build plans of rescue operation.
