Abstract
In this paper we present a new method for automated recognition of 12 microalgae that are most commonly found in water resources of Thailand. In order to handle some difﬁculties encountered in our
problem such as unclear algae boundary and noisy background, we proposed a new method for segmenting algae bodies from an image background and proposed a new method for computing texture
descriptors from a blurry texture object. Feature combination approach is applied to handle a variation
of algae shapes of the same genus. Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is used as a classiﬁer. An
experimental result of 97.22% classiﬁcation accuracy demonstrates an effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Introduction

Algae are important microscopic aquatic life forms as they are primary producers in an aquatic food
chain and oxygen producers in an aquatic ecosystem. In water resource management, algae are used as
a biological index to indicate a quality of water because they are sensitive to environmental changes [17].
Therefore, recognition of microalgae is one of the most important issues in water resource management.
However, this task is time-consuming and requires expert biologists to accomplish it. In this work, we
proposed a new method for automated classifying and recognizing microalgae in microscopic images.
Despite of its importance, there is a few research works on this problem. For example, the works [11,
21] proposed a classiﬁcation method for recognizing blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria).
Blue-green algae are of interest because they present a problem to water quality due to their toxic
nature. These methods were proposed to deal with a single division of algae. Our work aims to deal
with multiple microalgae divisions (i.e. both harmful and harmless species) that are most commonly
found in water resources of Thailand [14, 18]. Twelve genera of microalgae studied in this work are
detailed in Table 1. The intended contributions of our work are not limited only to recognize toxic
algae for the purpose of water quality assessment, but also to recognize common algae for the purpose
of aiding biologists for ecological study of diversity of algae in water resources, and semi-automated

generating microalgae taxonomy. In comparison to the previous works, our work faces with several
difﬁculties as followings:
1. Algae images used in most existing algae recognition system [11, 20, 21] are generated from a
similar imaging system, for which a resolution of captured images is known. However, in our
work we received microscopic images from various sources, in which different imaging systems
and different capturing information are used to produce images. Thus, algae images in our data
set have various resolution, illumination and magniﬁcation settings. This situation introduces a
major problem in a process of algae feature extraction, especially shape measurement features,
which will be described later in Section 3.3.
2. In comparison to the previous works [11, 20, 21], in which a single division of blue-green algae
has been studied. In our work, we study three divisions of microalgae, namely, blue-green algae,
green algae, and euglenoids. Among these divisions, algae in the green algae division are the most
difﬁcult to recognize, especially, Scenedesmus and Staurastrum genera. The algae shapes of each
of these genera are much more diverse than the algae shapes of those genera in the blue-green
algae division. In this work, we attempt to deal with this problem by combining multiple algae
features in a classiﬁcation process.
3. Some algae in microscopic images do not have clear boundaries. The ﬁrst cause of the blurred
boundary is due to an image acquisition process (e.g. illumination adjustment, wrong focus, etc.).
The second cause is from an alga itself. Some algae are enclosed by voluminous gelatinous coat
that make true shape boundaries of algae unclear. An example of this situation is illustrated by
Cosmarium genus as shown in Figure 1. In addition, a transparent appearance of spines and
ﬂagellums of algae in a microscopic image makes it difﬁcult to separate them from an image
background. The last difﬁculty of detecting an algae boundary is due to extraneous particles
polluted in an image background. When these particles are in contact with algae boundary (as
shown in Figure 1, Phacus genus), it is mostly impossible to separate them from the algae in a
segmentation process. Thus, in this work we propose a new segmentation method that is able
to deal with these difﬁculties. Details of our proposed segmentation method for automatically
segmenting algae from an image background will be described in Section 3.2.
4. Some algae in microscopic images do not have clear textures. This problem is critical especially
when algae of different genera have similar shape. Hence, the only feature that we can use to
indicate the difference between them is their texture. In this work we propose a new method
for extracting texture feature from a blurred texture object. The proposed method is based on
the texture features proposed by Haralick et al. [7]. Details of the method will be described in
Section 3.3.
Studies of microalgae recognition mostly use classiﬁcation methods, such as SVM [10,20], Artiﬁcial
Neural Network [11], Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) [20], and Discriminant Analysis [21].
In this work we propose to use the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm for training a
support vector classiﬁer using scaled polynomial kernels [13] in a classiﬁcation process. SMO has been
successfully applied in many application domains, including medical image analysis for lung [4] and
brain tumor detection [5], handwritten character recognition, text categorization, and speech recognition
[1].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we described our algae image
dataset. A new method for automated algae recognition are described in Section 3 and followed by
experimental results in Section 4. Finally, some discussions conclude this paper.

Algae Image Dataset

Algae microscopic images in our data set are collected from various sources. The main sources are
the research projects [14, 18] conducted by Department of Botany, Kasetsart University. Other sources
includes Metropolitan Waterworks Authority, online algae image database and the internet. In this work
we study twelve genera of microalgae that most commonly found in water resources of Thailand. The
twelve genera are from three divisions, namely, blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) division, green
algae division, and euglenoids division. Details of these genera are summarized in Table 1 and their
example algae images are shown in Figure 1. The data set comprises of 720 algae images, 60 images
for each genus. Since the images are collected from various sources, their size, illumination setting, and
magniﬁcation setting are largely varied.

Methodology

Classiﬁcation of algae images consists of 4 main steps, namely, a preprocessing step, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation.
1983

Preprocessing

A preprocessing is a process for preparing an input image to be suitable for processing (i.e, segmentation
and feature extraction). The ﬁrst preprocessing process is to resize an input image. Since sizes of our
input images are largely varied, we need to resize them into the same scale in order to correctly compute
algae shape features, particularly, shape measurement features (will be described in Section 3.3). The
images whose longest side is larger than 400 pixels are resized to 400 pixels while the other side remains
in the same aspect ratio.
The second preprocessing process is to convert a color input image into a gray-scale image. We
perform color-to-gray image transformation because we do not use color information of algae in a
classiﬁcation process. The ﬁrst reason is that our algae images are produced from several imaging
systems. Thus, colors of algae of the same genus may be varied signiﬁcantly, depending on imaging
systems and illumination adjustment. Secondly, colors or pigments of algae depend on environmental
conditions in which they are growing. Colors of algae of the same genus may vary in a wide range,
while colors of algae of different genera may be identical. As a result, color feature of algae is not
suitable for identifying or discriminating algae.

3.2

Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is a process of separating objects of interest from an image background and is of
a crucial preprocessing step for most object recognition systems. In general, the accuracy of classiﬁcation/recognition system depends heavily on the accuracy of object features used in a training process.
More precise segmentation result contributes to more accurate object feature computation.
The main difﬁculties of segmenting algae from an image background are noise and a blurred contour
and texture as discussed earlier. Most microscopic images of algae are usually corrupted by noise. Noise
in an image can be extraneous materials (or unwanted objects) and illumination artefacts. These noise
disrupt a segmentation process and it is not trivial to remove them without a loss of object information.
Moreover, it is often to occur that noise have similar characteristics to objects of interest. Thus, it is
quite problematic to a computer to automatically distinguish them by considering their features.
One of the most powerful tools for noise suppression is image smoothing (also known as lowpass
ﬁltering). Image smoothing suppresses the noise by attenuating its signal which makes its intensity
roughly consistent with those of its nearest neighbors. Unfortunately, in many cases, i) polluted objects
are much clearer and sharper than spines (in Scenedesmus, Xanthidium, and Staurastrum genera) and
ﬂagellums (in Euglena and Phacus genera) of algae; and ii) a thick gelatinous coat of algae is sharper
than a true algae boundary. If we perform a high degree of noise suppression in order to remove polluted
objects and a gelatinous coat, this usually removes spines, ﬂagellums, and internode contours of these
algae. On the other hand, if we perform a low degree of noise suppression, the detected boundary of
algae body often distorts and lies further away from the true boundary of the algae (due to touching
polluted objects and a thick gelatinous coat of algae) .
This situation causes a serious problem to classifying algae in Anabaena, Oscillatoria and Pleurotaenium genera. The algae in these genera have similar rod shape. The main difference between their
shapes is that algae in Oscillatoria and Pleurotaenium genera have smooth boundary, while algae in
Anabaena genus have ripple along its boundary. If we perform insufﬁcient image smoothing, the ripple
along the boundary of algae in Anabaena genus disappears (due to gelatinous coat), and the smooth
boundary of the algae in Oscillatoria and Pleurotaenium genera becomes ripple (due to small touching
polluted objects).
In order to handle this difﬁculty, we thus classify algae images into two groups: a rod shape and a
non-rod shape groups. Algae in Anabaena, Oscillatoria, Closterium, Pleurotaenium and Euglena are
classiﬁed into the rod shape group, while the rest are classiﬁed into the non-rod shape group. Algae

images in the rod shape group require high degree of image smoothing so that it can extract the contour
as close as possible to the true algae boundary. The non-rod shape group requires less degree of image
smoothing in order to preserve their spines or ﬂagellums. Thus, in a segmentation process, the two
groups of algae image are treated separately. In this work we propose a single-resolution edge detection for segmenting images in the non-rod shape group (because they require small amount of image
smoothing) and propose a multi-resolution edge detection to handle with images in the rod shape group
(because they require higher amount of image smoothing).
3.2.1 A single-resolution edge detection method
This segmentation method is designed to be applied to algae images in a non-rod shape group that we
have to preserve spines or ﬂagellums. Thus, we skip a smoothing process and start the algorithm with
Sobel edge detection on a grayscale image. The resulting gradient magnitude image is then put to the
Canny edge detection to produce an edge image. The edge image is a binary image where the 1 pixels
indicate edge pixels and the 0 pixels indicate non-edge√pixels. In the Canny edge detection [2] process,
we use a small value of smoothing parameter, namely, 2 in order to preserve as much as possible edges
of algae body. At this step, the area inside the algae body may possibly be full of holes and the algae
boundary is not always connected. We ﬁx this by applying morphological operators to the edge image.
Gaps along the algae boundary are ﬁlled by using a dilation operator with a bar-shaped structuring
element (SE) of size 2 pixels. The operation is performed in both vertical and horizontal directions.
After the boundary of algae are connected, a hole-ﬁlling operator [16] is performed in order to ﬁll holes
in the algae body. The ﬁnal step is to erode the shape of algae body back to its original size by using
an erosion operator with a bar-shaped SE of size 2 pixels in both vertical and horizontal directions (The
shape of algae body has been dilated in the process of ﬁlling gaps along the algae boundary).
In practice, algae images are often polluted by unwanted objects or illumination artefacts. It is
general that segmentation results obtained from the above steps usually contain isolated pixels/regions
around a shape and a background. Therefore, a postprocessing process usually needs to be performed
to eliminate those isolated pixels and small regions from a segmentation result. This can be done by applying morphological erosion with a diamond-shaped SE of size 3×3 pixels. The operator is performed
in both vertical and horizontal directions. An example of image segmentation using a single-resolution
edge detection method is shown in Figure 2.
3.2.2 A multi-resolution edge detection method
In a multi-resolution edge detection method, some additional steps of image smoothing are added in
addition to a normal process of a single-resolution edge detection method. A multi-resolution edge

detection method has two major steps: an initial step and a reﬁnement step, as followings:
An initial step: Similar to a single-resolution edge detection method, the ﬁrst step of this method starts
with Sobel edge detection and followed by the Canny edge detection. However,
√ this time a large
value of smoothing parameter of the Canny edge detection is used (i.e. 10). A large value
of smoothing parameter is used because in an initial step we only need to roughly estimate the
boundary of the algae in an image. The true boundary will be detected in the next reﬁnement step.
A reﬁnement step: After separating the algae body from a background, only the background of the
image will be heavily smoothed by using a Gaussian lowpass ﬁlter of size 20×20 pixels with
sigma equal to 0.5 in order to suppress all unwanted objects and illumination artefacts in the
image background. The foreground of the image (i.e. the algae body) is left unsmoothed because
we want to preserve as much as possible its edge details.
After a smoothing process, the smoothed image will simply be segmented by the single-resolution
edge detection method described above. A multi-resolution edge detection method derives its
name from the fact that edge detection is performed on an image with different smoothing resolutions of foreground and background regions.
In practice it does not know beforehand whether a new input image belongs to a rod shape or a nonrod shape groups. Thus, we generate the SMO classiﬁers in advance by using a single-resolution edge
detection method. The only three shape features, namely ratio of major and minor axis length, convex
area, and ratio of region area and area of its bounding box are used as shape features in a classiﬁcation
process. Based on our preliminary experimental results, these features are sufﬁcient for classifying rod
shaped algae from non-rod shaped algae. Additionally, these features are simple and fast computation.
The overall image segmentation method is summarized as following steps:
1. Performing image segmentation using a single-resolution edge detection.
2. Extracting three shape features: Ratio of major and minor axis length, convex area, and ratio of
region area and area of its bounding box.
3. Classifying a new image into either rod-shaped or non-rod shaped groups using SMO classiﬁer
based on the three shape features.
4. If the new image is classiﬁed as a rod-shaped alga, the image is re-segmented by using a multiresolution edge detection method to produce a new segmentation result. Otherwise, the segmentation result computed in the ﬁrst step is used.

3.3

Feature Extraction

Object classiﬁcation is a process of classify the observations into several genera. It performs by making
decisions on the basis of several features measured from an object. Several object features have been
studied in the literature and successfully used in practice, for example, color, shape, texture, and corner.
However, color and corner features do not seem to be very useful in our problem (as discussed earlier).
Hence, only shape and texture features are considered in this work. Shape features work effectively in
our problem since algae in each individual genus typically have their own unique shape. However, it
is not uncommon that two or more genera have similar shapes. In this case, texture features play an
important role in a classiﬁcation task. We note here that algae images in our data set have different sizes
and algae in each image have different directions or rotations. Thus, it is better to use algae features
that are invariant under scaling and rotation. In this work, three shape descriptors: Fourier descriptors,
1986

Automated Microalgae Image Classiﬁcation

Promdaen, Wattuya and Sanevas

moment invariant, and shape measures are considered (will be described later in this section). We also
propose a new texture feature computation method based on the texture descriptors proposed by Haralick
et al. [7].
We also note here that all object descriptors proposed in the literature have their own strengths
and weaknesses. Each descriptor is computed from different basis of object information and no object
feature can work well for all problems. Thus, we propose to apply a combination of multiple shape
descriptors and texture feature in a classiﬁcation process. In addition, using combination of multiple
features is also beneﬁcial for compensating segmentation errors made by a segmentation algorithm.
Objects (algae bodies) extracted in a segmentation step normally contain some segmentation errors.
Calculating shape and texture features from them can yield inaccurate object descriptors. Fortunately,
different descriptors are computed from different object information, thus, different descriptor errors are
produced. Hence, using multiple features can compensate the errors made by each other, resulting in
improvement of the classiﬁcation accuracy.
3.3.1 Fourier Descriptors
Fourier descriptors are successfully used in shape discrimination and shape analysis [12]. Because their
nice properties, such as simple derivation, simple normalization, and robustness to noise. They have
been extensively applied in many areas [3, 9]. Traditionally, the Fourier descriptors are not invariant
to scaling and the starting point. We have to normalize them so that they are invariant under these
conditions [22].
3.3.2 Moment Invariants
Moments invariants have been extensively used to characterize shape of objects in a variety of applications. Moments invariants are region-based shape descriptors and derived from information of all pixels
in a shape region. When relatively large amount of noise is present in an image, this approach is more
accurate than contour-based approach because it takes much more image pixels into account. In this
work we use the Hu’s seven moment invariants [8] that have the desirable properties of being invariant
under image translation, scaling, and rotation.
3.3.3

Shape Measures

Shape measures measure the properties of a shape region in a binary image. Ten measurements of
shape properties are investigated, namely, area, major axis length, minor axis length, major axis length
and minor axis length ratio, eccentricity, convex area, diameter, solidity, extent, and perimeter. These
measures are invariant under rotation, but not under image scaling. Thus, we have to normalize the size
of shapes before compute the shape features. We normalize the size of shapes regarding to the height
of the bounding box of shapes. All shapes are resized into the same height of bounding boxes while
preserving aspect ratio of the shape. In this work we set the height of the bounding box to 200 pixels.
3.3.4 Texture Features
Texture is one of the most important characteristics used for identifying objects. In this work we used
texture descriptors proposed by Haralick et al. [7]. In order to compute the texture descriptors, a graylevel co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is ﬁrst computed. This matrix is computed using grey-level values
within an object region. We extract grey-level values within the object region by using a segmentation
image as a mask. Following the work [15], we improve the GLCM by eliminating paired relationships
1987

Automated Microalgae Image Classiﬁcation

Promdaen, Wattuya and Sanevas

with background components appeared in the ﬁrst row and column of GLCM. Finally, Haralick’s thirteen texture descriptors are computed based on this matrix (For more detail of these descriptors we refer
the reader to the original work).
The proposed texture descriptor method
Unfortunately, some of our algae images have unclear texture. A GLCM computed by using above
method may contain a substantial number of errors and results in inaccurate texture descriptors. This
problem is critical when texture is the only feature that can be used to discriminate algae of different
genera with similar shape features. In this work we propose a new method for computing texture features
from a blurred texture object. The proposed method compute new texture descriptors by averaging the
texture descriptors extracted from the input image with different levels of edge enhancement. Edge
enhancement is performed in order to highlight blurred texture; however, it also highlights noise in
an object. As a result, the texture descriptors computed from an input image with different levels of
enhancement are not accurate. We then propose to average them to produce a new and more accurate
texture features because averaging is a good concept for effectively suppressing noise in data. In this
work, three levels of edge enhancement are performed in an input image. For each level we compute
the Haralick’s thirteen texture descriptors. The ﬁnal texture descriptors are the average of the three sets
of descriptors. Our preliminary experimental results indicate that using the new (averaging) version of
texture descriptors yield better classiﬁcation accuracy than using the original (unenhanced) version of
texture descriptors. In this work, an unsharp masking technique is used for edge enhancement.

Experiments
The Classiﬁers used in the Experiments

In this work we propose to use SMO classiﬁer in a classiﬁcation process. Our proposed method is
evaluated in comparison with three effective, well-known classiﬁers, namely, multilayer perceptron
(MLP) [19], Bagging [19], and J48 decision tree. All classiﬁers were applied using the same set of
object features. The parameter values of each classiﬁer were tuned in such a way that the highest
average of recognition accuracy was obtained. For each set of feature combinations, the same parameter
settings of each classiﬁer are applied. For MLP classiﬁers, a number of hidden nodes are dynamically
determined by a number of feature dimensions. The work [6] suggested that we should increase a
number of hidden nodes when a number of feature dimensions increases. For SMO classiﬁers, we set
a value of complexity parameter to 4. For Bagging classiﬁers, a number of training iterations was set
to 10. For the J48 decision tree, a default parameter setting set by WEKA is used. All classiﬁers used
in the experiments are provided by WEKA [6]. The dataset is divided by biologists into 540 training
images (45 images per class) and 180 test images (15 images per class).

4.2

Tuning the Parameters of Feature Descriptors

The accuracy of Fourier descriptors depends heavily on a number of sampling points. We empirically
tested the performance of Fourier descriptors by varying a number of sampling points. The experimental
results show that an appropriate number of sampling points is 32 points, which is sufﬁcient for describing
ﬁne details of shape contours with reasonable computation time. The accuracy of GLCM-based texture
descriptors depends on a number of gray levels used for computing the GLCM. We empirically tested the
performance of GLCM-based texture descriptors by vary the number of gray levels. The experimental
results suggest that the most effective number of gray-levels is 256 gray levels. The total number of
features used in the experiments are summarized in the 7th column of Table 2.

Classiﬁcation Performance

We conduct a series of experiments and discuss their results in two approaches. The ﬁrst approach
is using a single object features and the second approach is using a combination of multiple object
features. The accuracy of different approaches are reported in Table 2. A single object feature approach
is reported from dataset number 1 to 4, while a combination approach is reported from dataset number
5 to 15.
4.3.1

The Performance of using a Single Object Features

In a single object feature approach, texture features (dataset number 4 in Table 2) give the lowest classiﬁcation accuracy in comparison with the three shape descriptors. This is because geometric information
of algae shapes is more discriminative than texture information of algae. As we discussed earlier, an
intensity variation of algae body can be largely varied due to illumination adjustment in an imaging process or due to environmental conditions in which algae are growing. Thus, using texture feature alone is
hard to achieve good classiﬁcation accuracy. Nevertheless, they are still useful for discriminating algae

of different genera having similar shape features from each other.
Among the three shape descriptors, the moment invariants (dataset number 1 in Table 2) give the
lowest classiﬁcation accuracy. Even though the moment invariants have been proved to be invariant under image scaling and rotation, the proof was made under the assumption of continuous image functions
and noise-free. In practice, images are discrete and prone to noise. Therefore, errors are inevitably presented during computation of the moment invariants, resulting in low classiﬁcation accuracy. However,
the experimental results show that even though the moment invariants seem to have small discrimination
ability, it still contributes to a classiﬁcation of algae in a feature combination approach. Finally, Shape
measures and Fourier descriptors perform comparable performance. Although algae boundaries contain
some segmentation errors, both descriptors have shown their robustness to segmentation errors.

The Performance of using a Combination of Multiple Features

From Table 2, we can notice that the accuracy of using multiple features is mostly higher than the accuracy of using a single feature for all classiﬁers (except for J48 decision tree). The main observations
of these experimental scenarios are summarized as following: i) Using a combination of only shape
features (dataset number 11) is not sufﬁcient for discriminating algae with similar shape features that
belong to different genera correctly. We can conclude here that using only shape features is not able to
achieve desirable classiﬁcation accuracy, and this indicates the need of texture features; ii) The highest
classiﬁcation accuracy we can achieve is 97.22% provided by SMO classiﬁers with a combination of all
feature descriptors (dataset number 15). This indicates the usefulness of texture features that help classiﬁers correctly classiﬁed algae with similar shapes into different genera; iii) The classiﬁcation accuracy
of SMO classiﬁer dropped to 96.11% when the moment invariants were not used in a training process
(dataset number 14). This demonstrates the usefulness of the moment invariants. The moment invariants
can be used to compensate errors or ambiguities of Fourier and shape measurement descriptors.
Table 3 shows a confusion matrix of SMO classiﬁer with a combination of four descriptors (dataset
number 15). We achieve 100% classiﬁcation accuracy in most classes, except for Oscillatoria, Microcystis, Scenedesmus, and Euglena. Two algae of Oscillatoria genus are misclassiﬁed to Pleurotaenium
genus because they have almost the same shape features and texture of these two algae is not clear. One
alga of Microcystis genus is misclassiﬁed to Xanthidium genus because the shape of this alga is largely
different from the algae in its genus. One alga of Scenedesmus is misclassiﬁed to Staurastrum genus
because both algae have similar pattern of their spines. Finally, one alga of Euglena is misclassiﬁed to
Closterium genus because its shape is more similar to shapes of algae in Closterium genus than shapes
of algae in its own genus. Moreover, the texture of this alga in an image is substantially unclear. Thus,
texture descriptors cannot help in this case.

Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented an automated microalgae recognition method for microscopic images. A new image segmentation method for separating algae from an image background was proposed. Our proposed
segmentation method can deal with several segmentation difﬁculties such as unclear algae boundary,
transparent appearances of spines and ﬂagellums of algae, and touching polluted objects. The causes of
the unclear boundary can occur during image acquisition process and can be caused by the characteristic
of algae themselves. The spines and ﬂagellums of algae look transparent when they are captured by a
camera. Often, these parts of algae in an image are much more blurred than extraneous objects polluted
in an image. Our new segmentation method based on single- and multi-resolution edge detection can
handle this situation well. Moreover, we proposed a new method for computing texture descriptors from

blurry texture objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation
method and our proposed texture descriptor computation method.
Even though our ﬁrst results are promising, many tasks remain for future work to improve the
performance of the current system. For example, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the
proposed method on a larger set of image data. The feature selection methods should be investigated
and applied in order to reduce a number of features used in a classiﬁcation process. Furthermore, it is
essential for a classiﬁer to have a rejection mechanism to reject unknown algae or extraneous objects
that are unknown to the trained classiﬁer. Rejecting the unknown objects would make the recognition
system more reasonable than classifying them into any incorrect class.
