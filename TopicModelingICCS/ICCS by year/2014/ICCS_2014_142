Abstract
This study presents a numerical method for solving a class of equations that partly consists of two
derivatives of the unknown state, namely the first derivative at the moment and the second derivative
at a previous certain time, as well as an integro-differential term containing a weakly singular kernel.
These equations are types of integro-differential equation of the second kind and were originally
obtained from an aeroelasticity problem. In an integrable condition, the precise solutions of this class
of equations can be obtained by transforming the equations into equations similar to the Volterra
integral equations of the second kind with delay. The main contribution of this study is to propose a
semi-discretized numerical method that does not involve transforming the original equation into the
corresponding Volterra equation, but still enables the numerical solution of the original equation to be
determined. The feasibility of the proposed numerical method is demonstrated by applying examples
in measuring the maximum errors with exact solutions and comparing graphs of the numerical and
exact solutions.
Keywords: integro-differential term, Volterra integral equations of the second kind

1 Introduction
A dynamical system describing a two-dimensional physical thin airfoil moving inside an
incompressible flow was introduced by Burns, Cliff, and Herdman [1] in 1983. The system contains a
form of linear singular integro-differential equations with integration over a deterministic interval (i.e.,
equations not of the Volterra types). Other studies [2, 10] have presented the well-posedness of the
problem regarding specific product spaces and the exact solutions of the original class of integrodifferential equations of the first kind, and have reported numerical methods and corresponding
numerical results [3, 4, 5, 6, 9]. Associated optimal control problems are topics discussed in [7, 8, 14].

Another study [12] applied semigroup theory to this particular type of equation and constructed an
associated abstract Cauchy problem. The current study presents a numerical method for solving the
type of equations containing not only the original aeroelastic integro-differential term as a part of the
equation but also two time-derivative states evaluated at different times. This new linear equation can
be named the “integro-differential equation of the second kind.” The main purpose of this study is to
develop a feasible numerical method for solving this type of integro-differential equation. According
to previous studies (for example, [13]), all existing numerical methods can be used for solving only
integro-differential equations of the second kind that can be transformed into Volterra integral
equations of the second kind, and no numerical method has been proposed for solving integrodifferential equations of the second kind directly. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 presents the derivation of the associated Volterra integral equations of the second kind,
which can be obtained from a variation of the aeroelastic singular integro-differential equation.
Section 3 presents the semi-discretized numerical method used for directly solving singular integrodifferential equations of the second kind. Section 4 presents the numerical results of test examples
obtained by applying the numerical method described in Section 3. Finally, Section 5 presents a
summary of this study.

2 Problem Description
Consider the class of an integro-differential equation of the second kind expressed as follows:
d
(1)
a1x (t ) + a2 x (t − b) + a3 Dxt = f (t ),
dt
and the initial condition
(2)
x(s) = φ (s), s ≤ 0,
where a1, a2 , a3 are constants and b is a positive constant. The term x (t ) is the derivative of the state
with respect to t , and the difference operator D is defined as
0

Dxt = ∫ g ( s) xt ( s)ds .
−b

The second part of the integrand represents

xt (s) = x(t + s) ,
and the first part is a weakly singular function

g (s) ∈ L 1[− b, 0],
that is integrable, positive, nondecreasing, and weakly singular at s = 0 . Assume the forcing term
f (t ) is locally integrable for t > 0. Although a more general kernel g is also suitable, this study
focuses on the Abel-type kernel and considers g (s) =| s |− p and s ∈ [− b, 0] for 0 < p < 1. A specific
value of p = 0.5 corresponds to the original aeroelastic problem. Assume that the initial condition

φ (s) , for −b ≤ s ≤ 0, is in L 1, g space,aweighted L 1 space with weight g (⋅) .
If the differential part of the integro-differential term can be removed, that is, the term Dx0 exists,
then applying the integration to Equation (1) forms a new equation of the following form:
t

a1 x(t ) + a2φ (t − b) + a3 Dxt = a1 (0) + a2φ (− b ) + a3 Dx0 +

∫ f (τ )dτ , for 0 < t ≤ b.
0

This equation can be developed into a Volterra integral equation of the second kind, provided that the
function

is absolutely continuous with respect to t > 0 , and the product of the kernel and initial functions,

kind by assuming a 1 = a 2 = a 3 = 1 is

After substituting the form of ξ previously defined in Equation (8) into Equations (6) and (7), the

The procedure for obtaining the initial condition α i (0), i = 0,1,…, n, for the first-order ordinary
differential system (15) is described as follows: For the initial condition, combine Equations (4), (5),
and (8), and fix t = 0 ; the state thus becomes

φ (τ i )

for

Next, to determine α 0 (t ),α1 (t ),…,α n (t ), apply an ordinary differential equation solver (Matlab
“ode45”) to the system (15). Two methods can be used to solve x(t ) , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 , depending on the
setting of variables: fix t = 1 or s = 0 in Equation (8). According to the property B j (s) = 1 at s = τ j ,

j = 0,1,, n, the two choices become two cases for the solution x(t ) , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 :
Case 1:

x(1 + τ i ) =

n

∑ α j (1) B j (τ i ) = αi (1),
j =0

and Case 2:

x(1 + τ i ) =

n

∑ α j (1 + τ i ) B j (0) = α0 (1 + τ i ).
j =0

A similar method can be applied to solve x(t ) , for 1 < t < ∞ . In Case 1, solve for α i (t ),
i = 0, 1,, n , based on Equation (15) and set t = 1. Thus, α i (1) yields the corresponding solutions

x(1 + τ i ), i = 0, 1,, n . In Case 2, solve for α 0 (t ) , by using Equation (15) and the Matlab software
command “ode45.” Subsequently, set t = 1 + τ i to obtain α 0 (1 + τ i ) for i = 0, 1,, n . Therefore,
α 0 (1 + τ i ) is the solution x(1 + τ i ) for i = 0, 1,, n .

Remark 1.
This study presents a numerical method for directly solving the integro-differential equations of the
second kind. The method involves discretizing the space s, and retains the variable t. The unknown
states x(t ) thus depend only on t , and are represented by α i (t ), i = 0,1,, n . To solve system (15),
the authors suggest using an ordinary differential equation solver, which is a semi-discretized scheme.
Remark 2.
The rate of convergence can be determined, although it depends on the separating variable form of the
state as well as on the accuracy of the ordinary differential equation solver applied. Another approach
to determining the rate of convergence in this observed study is to discretize both variables s and t ,
and this process results in a full-discretized scheme, as described in [6].

5 Summary
This study presents a numerical method for solving a class of singular integro-differential
equations of the second kind that contain derivatives of the states at the boundary points of the finite
history interval. Some of the proposed equations can be transformed into Volterra integral equations of
the second kind if the integro-differential term is integrable. This study presents numerical solutions to
the typical equation obtained using Matlab software. The graphs of the exact solutions and numerical
solutions and the table of corresponding maximum errors show the feasibility of using the proposed
numerical method.
