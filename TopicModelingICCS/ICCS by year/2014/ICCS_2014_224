Abstract
A major factor in the consideration of an electrical power network of the scale of a national grid is the
calculation of power flow and in part icular, optimal power flow. Th is paper considers such a
network, in which d istributed generation is used, and examines how the network can be optimized, in
terms of transmission line capacity, in order to obtain optimal or at least high -performing
configurations, using multi-objective optimisation by evolutionary computing meth ods.
Keywords: M ulti-objective, Optimisation, Evolutionary Computing, Electrical Power, Grid

1 Introduction
This work exp lores a possible method of addressing the configuration of large -scale electrical
power networks, such as a national grid, using an approach based on evolutionary computing, which
has been used previously in comp lex systems research such as emergent computation (Mitchell, 1999)
and dynamics of co mplex networks (Aguilar-Hidalgo et al., 2012), and also direct ly in OPF research
(Pandya and Joshi, 2008). As described by Allen et al., (Allen et al., 2010), consideration of systems
exhibit ing co mplexity entails the construction of synergies between the studies of systems and their
structures, and the ideas of neo-Darwinian evolutionary processes.
The essential problem in the architecture o f national grid networks is that of power flow and
optimal power flow (OPF) calculations of alternating current (A C) power, and these calculations are
at the centre of Independent System Operator (ISO) power markets (Cain et al., 2013) in which A C
OPF is solved over a number of different orders of magnitude of timescales, fro m minutes via hours,
to annually and mult i-year horizons, where the latter is for planning and investment while the former
are for ensuring demand is met and for spot market pricing. The ISO produces and acquires load
forecasts, receives offers of power fro m generating companies acting within a co mpetit ive auction
market, and produces generation schedules consisting of required power units and a price, to meet
demand within the constraints of the grid and generators.

Power Grid Network Optimisation by Evolutionary Computing

J. Oliver, T. Kipouros and M. Savill

Electrical power networks can be improved both technically and economically through the
inclusion of distributed generation (DG) which may include renewable energy sources. DG units are
lower output generators that provide incremental capacity at specific geographical locations, th us
enhancing voltage support and improving network reliability while also acting economically as a
hedge against a high price of centrally produced power, through locational marg inal pricing (LM P) .
The operation of grids by ISOs as unbundled auction wholesale spot power markets that support realtime pricing provides a further incentive to roll-out DG, thus arises the need to define the type,
number and location of extra DG units (Gautam and Mithulananthan, 2007).
The work presented here addresses the composition of a DG A C electrical power network based
upon the IEEE 30 Bus Test Case which represents a portion of the American Electric Power System
(in the Mid western US) in December 1961, and which was downloaded fro m (Christie, 1993). Th is
network, as shown in Figure 1, is amended to have six central fixed large-scale open cycle gas turbine
(OCGT) electrical power stations, and twenty four variable distributed generators, powered either by
renewable energy sources, being solar photovoltaic (PV) or micro -wind turbine, or by micro gas
turbine. In part icular, this work uses historical data of weather (in the form of actual solar PV and
wind power generation), central power generation, and electrical energy demands, fro m Australia of
2010, thus providing a realistic simulation environment for both demand and renewable generation.
This work continues the investigation of optimising power networks by Oliver et al. (Oliver et al.,
Expected Ju ly 2014), by looking at the power capacity of t ransmission lines, as well as considering
the number and types of DG unit used in the network. In this way, the network connections undergo
an optimising process, as well as the nodes (the buses) comp rising the network. The aims are then to
determine the co mposition of the power network in terms o f the type, number and location of the noncentral DG un its, allowing transmission line power capacity to become further variables within the
optimisation, with the goal of finding the smallest capital cost in meeting the demand for power, while
keeping over- and under-production of power as low as possible, and of min imizing the average spot
price and CO2 emissions.

2 Background
The Plexos tool (Energy Exemp lar Pty Ltd, 2013) is incorporated to provide both OPF and
financial market simu lations, in particular providing unit co mmit ment (which generators should be
used, bearing in mind their operating characteristics such as ramp-up time as well as power output and
running costs), economic dispatch (which generators to use to meet demand fro m a cost viewpoint),
transmission analyses (losses, congestion), and spot market operation. It also provides estimations of
CO2 emissions. The volu me of lost load (Vo LL) is the threshold pric e above which loads prefer to
switch off, while the du mp energy p rice is that belo w which generators prefer to switch off, and these
along with market auctions also contribute to the ratio of power generated to power consumed.
Transmission losses are also taken into account within Plexos through sequential linear programming.
Plexos is integrated with a mu lti-objective optimizing evolutionary algorith m (MOOEA) (Oliver et
al., 2013), thus establishing an optimization feedback loop, since Plexos gives optimal unit
commit ment for a g iven set of DG units, wh ile the MOOEA is used to deter-mine the optimal set of
generators for the given demand profile and weather pattern. A M OOEA is used as they have a
history of tackling non-linear (Nicolis, 1995) mu lt i-objective and mu lti-dimensional optimizat ion
problems successfully, and since OPF fo r AC power is a non -linear problem while power markets
require mu lti-part non-linear pricing. In the model used here, there are seventy two parameters that
constitute the design vector applicable to each candidate solution, represented as one individual in the
MOOEA, thus the problem is both non-linear and mu lti-d imensional. The simu lation has a horizon of

one calendar year, rep resented as 365 steps of 1 day increments with a resolution to 30 minutes, fro m
01-Jan-2010.
A MOOEA (Deb, 2001) is generally a heuristic, stochastic means of searching very large nonlinear decision or objective spaces in order to attempt to obtain (near) optimal or high-performing
solutions (Jones et al., 2002) for problems upon which classical optimization methods do not perform
well. EAs are characterized by populations of potential solutions that converge towards local or
global optima through evolution by algorithmic selection as inspired by neo -Darwinian (Coello
Coello, 2006) evolutionary processes. An init ial population of random solutions is created and
through the evaluation of their fitnesses for selection for reproduction, and by the introduction of
variation through mutation and reco mbination (crossover), the solutions are able to evolve towards the
optima. MOO produces a set of trade-off solution points (Fonseca and Fleming, 1995) since all
objectives are optimised simu ltaneously, giving rise to individuals that cannot be improved upon in
one OF dimension without being degraded in another. When each remain ing solution in the
population cannot be said to be better than any other in all OF d imensions, they are called nondominated and are members of the local Pareto-optimal set, and are all of equal value and potential
interest to the researcher. The non-do minated set of the entire feasible search space is the global
Pareto-optimal set (Deb, 2001).

3 Method
The MOOEA used here is a mu lt i-objective optimizing genetic algorithm that self-adapts its
control parameters, imp lemented in Java (Oliver et al., Expected July 2014), where the term selfadaptive is used in the sense of Eiben et al. (Eiben et al., 2006) fo llo wing on fro m the work of Bäck
(Bäck, 1992) , to indicate control parameters that are encoded in the internal representation of each
candidate solution along with the problem definition parameters applying to the objective functions
(the main parameters), and that these control parameters are subject to change along with the main
parameters due to mutation and crossover. This is d ifferent fro m a purely adaptive control parameter
strategy as in that case the change is instigated algorithmically by some feedback at the higher level of
the GA rather than the lower level of each chro mo -some/solution in the population. The deterministic
approach is rule-based and is not considered adaptive.
The Plexos tool is used as the source of the values of the objective functions that are evaluated and
selected for, that is to say, the fitness indicators, by the MOOEA, as depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2. The integration of Plexos with the self-adaptive multi-objective optimisation algorithm.

The problem is defined as a set of potential DG units each of which may or may not be located at a
given node (bus). The DG units are defined as (i) micro-gas turbine (ii) Wind turbine and (iii) So lar
photovoltaic, where a unit of value 0 means the generator is not present at the location. The scenario
allo ws for up to 5 units of each type to be located at any of the nodes defined as variable in the
network d iagram (Figure 1), which means that it is any except for the nodes 1, 2, 13, 22, 23 and 27, as
these are the large fixed central OCGT power stations. Each t ransmission line between any two buses
has a maximu m flow capacity stated in megawatts (MW). The transmission line capacities are
amended in the Plexos Xml model file which are sent to Plexos for each solution run.
The labels shown as Vn at the g iven nodes indicate the design variable nu mber that defines the
number o f units of the given generator types at that bus, and as can be seen, each of the 3 variable
types can be present potentially. As there are 24 nodes at which variable DG un its can be located and
3 types of generator, the design vector of each candidate solution therefore consists of 72 variables. A
candidate solution is therefore a vector of n decision variables: ൌ ሺ‫ ݔ‬ଵ ǡ‫ ݔ‬ଶ ǡ ǥ ǡ ‫ ݔ‬௡ሻ , where n = 72. This
configuration thus allows a solution to have from 0 DG units up to a theoretical 360 (being 5 units of
each of 3 DG types at the 24 nodes). Table 1 belo w shows the allocation of DG units by type to
nodes, cross-referenced to its variable nu mber (as shown in Figure 1), with the assumption that a
given generator feeds in to one associated node only.

There are 4 objective functions defined, all of wh ich are to be minimised simu ltaneously and the
values for all of which come from Plexos, these being:
݉݅݊‫ ܨ‬ሺσ ‫ ݑ‬ሻ ൌ sumU
݉݅݊‫ ܨ‬ሺ‫݌݉ݑܦ݁ݏݑ‬ሻ ൌ |useDump|

݉݅݊‫ ܨ‬ሺ‫ ݉݁ʹܱܥ‬ሻ ൌ ‫݉݁ʹܱܥ‬

in which the values represent respectively:
i.
The total number of DG units
ii.
The USE/DUMP energy (MWh)
iii.
Spot Price ($/MWh)
iv.
CO2 emissions (Kg)
Considering the values above, useDump, depending whether it is negative or positive, is either the
un-served amount of energy due to under-production or the dump energy due to over-production,
relative to demand. The spot price is the mean price achieved in the simulated market auctions over
the course of the simulation in Plexos.
A hard constraint on the total number of DG units deployed, u, is applied in Equation 5, in order to
investigate how the system transforms itself. Without such a constraint, which can be viewed as a
limit to financial resources available as investment into DG, we would perhaps expect the system to
maximize DG deployment as this provides a known benefit where cost is the only downside, and this
would hide the effects that placement may have when otherwise. It is the number of DG units (and
their placement) that is particu larly of interest in these studies, and having the objective function for
the total DG units is important as it ensures diversity in sumU, enabling plots such as Figure 5 to be
possible. The intention of this rather low constraint for this case is to encourage the optimisation to
find the best locations for the ext ra DG units, rather than simply adding more units overall, to better
illustrate the potential of the method.

The candidate solutions chosen by the MOOEA, using the results from Plexos, are thus selected
due to the effect their chosen DG un its have on the electrical network due to their operating
characteristics and where they feed into the network, defined in the topology as shown in Figure 1.
The MOOEA , as described at the start of section 3 above, allows each new experiment to override
its default init ializer which creates an init ial population of candidate solutions by generating variables
under a uniform random distribution regime within the ranges of the defined va riables, in this case 0
<= u <= 5. The in itializer used instead generates solutions that meet the hard constraint, by selecting
for each solution a random value between 0 and the constraint, 35, and using this as the limit for that
candidate solution. Each variab le of that solution is then selected randomly, and is allocated a random
value within its range, until the solution’s own limit is reached. In this way, solutions in the in itial
population will vary between 0 DG units and 35 with a uniform distribution.
In subsequent generations, solutions will evolve that may break the hard constraint, due to
mutation and reco mbination operators acting on ‘fit’ parent solutions selected for breeding, and in this
case the solutions will be retained in the population but repaired. Repairing in this context means that
a failing solution’s vector of DG variables is changed until it falls with in the constraint, by randomly
choosing one of the variables, decrementing its DG unit count (when it has ‫ ݑ‬൒ ͳ), and then repeating
the process until the total falls within the constraint.

The MOOEA is configured to have a mixed chromosome consisting of a vector of 72 integers, for
the DG genes, one per bus, with the self-adaptive control parameters encoded as real numbers. In
addition, another 41 genes each contain the line maximu m flow capacity (LC), in MW, of a given
transmission line. In the first optimisation defined, the LC genes are fixed but one is changed to a
new value, while in the following optimisation, all 41 are enabled to evolve. There is a fixed
population of size 30, allo wing 0 duplicate solutions in any single generation, with initial crossover
and mutation probabilities of 0.9 and 0.009 (≈ 1/(72+41)) respectively. The MOOEA is allowed to
run for 2,000 function evaluations (67 generations), with each generation taking around 3 hours
elapsed time.

4 Results
Some figures belo w show results in the form of parallel coordinates (|| -coords), the technique
introduced and promulgated originally by Inselberg (Inselberg, 2009), and later used in the field of
optimisation by (Fleming et al., 2005), (Siirtola, 2000), (Siirtola and Räihä, 2006) , and engineering
design (Kipouros et al., 2008) and (Kipouros et al., 2013), in which each dimension is oriented
parallel to the others, thus transforming an n -dimensional po int into a 2-dimensional polygonal line
that relates the values in each dimension. This technique enables highly mult i-d imensional data to be
plotted uniquely and without loss of information, and in these cases the whole design space of each
solution, 72 variables, are plotted alongside their 4 objective function results. These plots were
produced using the Parallax tool (Avidan and Avidan, 1999).
As a first experiment, the maximu m flow capacity of just one line is altered and the results
compared with a prev ious run in which all aspects are the same, including the seed for the pseudo random nu mber generator, except fo r the line capacity. In this case, line 11 is chosen, being that
between the most highly connected bus, node 6, and node 9 which has less than half the connections,

and for which the line capacity is a low-ish 65 MW. The line’s capacity is doubled to 130 MW, a
figure used by other transmission lines in the network, in the new network definit ion. The new
results, for the higher line capacity, are termed R008 and the previous with original line capacity,
R003.
The plot in Figure 3 shows the entire 72-variable set and the objective functions for the new result
set (termed R008) with the higher line 11 capacity. This has some variables as always 0, hence these
can be said to be of no relevance to further optimisation runs, allowing them to be removed in future,
in order to improve optimisation performance.
The results of the objective function min imisations appear in Table 2, although sumU (the total
number of DG un its used) is not listed as this is always between 0 and 35, given the hard constraint.
It can be seen that just changing the one line capacity fro m 65 MW to 130 MW imp roves each OF
result.

The plot in Figure 3 shows that the variable v 11, which contains the number of units of W ind DG
for node 6, when having the value 5, is on the many highly performing solutions, including the best
solution of all. The R003 results shown in Figure 4 in a similar fashion to Figure 3, seem to indicate
that the reasons for the improved perfo rmance in R008, is that the nu mber o f DG units for node 9 are
no longer so important as variables v19 (node 9, Gas) and v20 (node 9, Wind) are no longer on the
optimu m path in R008, wh ile for R003 both are at maximu m (5). R008 also has fewer variab les at 0,
which seems to suggest the network load may be better balanced too. The scatter plot of Figure 5
shows the variation of the mean spot price against the total number of DG units (sumU), with the most
converged points manually selected, and in Figure 6, the subset of those selected points in which v11
has 5 DG units, are highlighted.

solution having the best result for the useDump objective. This plot shows the 72 DG unit values and the
41 line capacity values, along with the 4 OF results.

A subsequent optimizat ion was t ried in wh ich the maximu m flo w capacities of all lines were
allo wed to evolve along with the DG units. In this case, the 41 line capacity (LC) genes were
initialised following a Gaussian distribution using the mean and standard deviation fro m the first
optimisation, with limits applied for a minimu m o f 4 MW, a maximu m of 300 MW . An additional
hard constraint was applied on the total flow capacity, being equal to the original p lus 20%. Figure 7
shows the isolated solution having the best result for the useDu mp object ive with points of interest
circled and numbered. Points 1 and 2 show that line 9 (between buses 6 and 7) has both a low
(47MW) and high (300 MW) value fo r the same h igh -performing solution, indicating that it is not a
critical path. Its original LC was set to 130 MW, wh ich suggests that this could be optimised down to
the lower value found, although this would need to be further explored. Point 3 shows line 32
(between buses 23 and 24) has evolved down to zero (fro m 16 in the datum design), indic ating that
this line might be able to be eliminated entirely. Point 4 shows that the total of DG units was 35, as
would be expected in a high-performing solution, given the constraint on the total number of units
allo wed. Figure 8 belo w shows the solutions selected by having line 20 at 300 MW, which are all
high-performing and some of wh ich are the best performing for useDump and CO 2 as indicated by the
brace at the bottom right of the image. Line 20 runs between buses 14 and 15.

solutions are highly performing (indicated by the brace at the bottom right).

5 Conclusion
It has been shown that this methodology, using the MOOEA with Plexos and examining the
results with a mult i-d imensional visualisation, can be used to assist in the design of network
topologies from the perspective of transmission line maximu m power flow capacities, by allowing the
optimisation process to determine the maximu m flow capacit ies along with the types and locations of
DG units. It also shows that this method could be used to assist in the determination of network
topology fro m a bus-to-bus connection perspective, through elucidation of at least best and worst lines
for transmission and therefore connectivity. It should be remembered that these results relate to
particular weather patterns for a reg ion in which this model power grid is imposed, and that the DG
unit placement is realistic in that regard, considering micro-wind turbines and solar pv units.
