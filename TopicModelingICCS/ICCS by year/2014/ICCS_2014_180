Abstract
We discretized the two-dimensional linear momentum, microrotation, energy and mass conservation
equations from micropolar ﬂuids theory, with the ﬁnite element method, creating divergence conforming spaces based on B-spline basis functions to obtain pointwise divergence free solutions [8]. Weak
boundary conditions were imposed using Nitsche’s method for tangential conditions, while normal conditions were imposed strongly.
Once the exact mass conservation was provided by the divergence free formulation, we focused on
evaluating the differences between micropolar ﬂuids and conventional ﬂuids, to show the advantages of
using the micropolar ﬂuid model to capture the features of complex ﬂuids. A square and an arc heat
driven cavities were solved as test cases. A variation of the parameters of the model, along with the
variation of Rayleigh number were performed for a better understanding of the system.
The divergence free formulation was used to guarantee an accurate solution of the ﬂow. This formulation was implemented using the framework PetIGA as a basis, using its parallel stuctures to achieve
high scalability. The results of the square heat driven cavity test case are in good agreement with those
reported earlier.

Introduction

Micropolar ﬂuids are a subclass of simple microﬂuids presented by Eringen [1], that have gained attention from researchers because they can succesfully model the behavior of non-Newtonian ﬂuids like
ferro liquids, liquid polymers, and any ﬂuid with suspended particles in it. One of many applications
is to model nanoﬂuids, where inserting nanoparticles can change physical properties in a desired way
depending on the volume fraction of the nanoparticles. Like is the case of ﬂuid heat transfer systems
where nanoparticles are added to increase the effective heat conductivity for numerous applications.
Nanoﬂuids are better modeled using the micropolar ﬂuids theory. This takes into account the conservation of angular momentum of the nanoparticles that are not described by the regular Navier-Stokes
equations.
Micropolar ﬂuids consist of randomly oriented particles submerged in a viscous ﬂuid where the deformation of the particles is neglected. Here we present the results for an isotropic, incompressible micropolar ﬂuid to represent the steady state of natural convection in the heat driven cavity, using Boussinesq approximation for buoyancy effects. We modelled the system using the ﬁnite element method
with B-splines basis functions, where to satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition
we used a divergence conforming space discretization, obtaining pointwise divergence free results.

Micropolar theory

The micropolar theory [1] adds the effects of randomly oriented particles inside the ﬂuid to the regular
Navier-Stokes model. This at the continuum scale is modeled by introducing the microrotation conservation equation. Microrotation of the particles is represented as a vector quantity that is transported and
dispersed inside the ﬂuid. It also has inﬂuence over the ﬂuid velocity, presenting a two-way coupled,
nonlinear system (1).
The following equations describe the mass, linear momentum, microrotation and energy conservation present in the micropolar theory, where we assume a steady state of the system. The problem in its
strong form is to ﬁnd u, p, φ and θ such that:

where σ(u, p) = −pδ + 2(μ + κ)∇s u denotes the Cauchy stress tensor for incompressible ﬂows,
having δ as Kronecker’s delta and ∇s u as the symmetric tensor called the rate of deformation or strain
rate tensor. Here u is the ﬂuid velocity , p the ﬂuid pressure, φ the microrotation, θ the temperature,

of microinertia, gr the acceleration due to gravity, f are the body forces, h the Dirichlet boundary
condition for the velocity, i the traction on the surface, and m the Dirichlet boundary condition for

In the system of equations (1), we have advective terms that represent the transport of a property
due to the ﬂuid motion, these are present in momentum and microrotation conservation equations, the
diffusive terms that represent the transport of a property due to the differences of its concentration in
space are present on all the equations except for mass conservation, and the buoyancy term that is
taken as the Boussinesq approximation to represent the movement of the ﬂuid due to density changes
related to temperature variations [1, 2]. The Micropolar problem written in its weak form is to ﬁnd
U = {u, φ, p, θ} ∈ V such that ∀W = {w, z, q, s} ∈ V:
(W, L U) =B(W, U) = B1 (W, U) + B2 (W, U, U) = L(W)
where B1 is a bilinear form and B2 is a trilinear form representing the advection terms, knowing that

Discretization of Velocity-Pressure ﬁelds

For the discretization of our variables, we will use divergence conforming spaces to overcome the LBB
condition present due to the incompressibility cons. According to the discrete differential form theory,
one can build conforming spaces for operators like divergence and curl. Using these spaces, the divergence free and/or curl free conditions can be guaranteed by construction [6, 9], then using the discrete

version of these spaces leads to pointwise zero divergence or curl respectively.
Using the concept of isogeometric discrete differential forms [5] we deﬁne divergence conforming
spaces using B-spline basis functions as:

where S is the B-splines function space, p denotes the polynomial order, and α denotes the inter-element
continuity. This choice of spaces can be interpreted as a smooth generalization of Raviart-Thomas
elements. Assuming a polynomial order p = 1 and a continuity α = 0 the discretization can be seen as
implementing standard Raviart-Thomas elements, Figure 1.

Figure 1: Discretization of Velocity and Pressure ﬁelds for 2D
When solving on any geometry different than the parametric, a divergence conserving transformation has to be used to relate physical with parametric space. We retain the divergence free property by
using the Piola transformation when mapping the velocity, and a integral preserving mapping for the
other variables, this way the following operators are introduced:
u=
φ=

J −1 FU ◦ ϕ−1
J −1 FΦ ◦ ϕ−1

p=

J −1 P ◦ ϕ−1

θ=

J −1 Θ ◦ ϕ−1

where F is the Jacobian matrix of the parametric to physical mapping ϕ, Figure 2, and J is the determinant of F. Variables on the parametric domain are denoted by capital letters, while physical variables
are denoted by lowercase letters. To map scalar variables like p and θ the integral-preserving transformation introduces J −1 to scale the value, while for vector variables like u and φ, the deformation
gradient F is also introduced in the expression to take into account the changes in the vector directions.

2.2

Boundary condition imposition

The normal boundary conditions of the velocity were imposed strongly, but doing the same for the tangential boundary conditions on the velocity, while using divergence conforming spaces can be unstable
due to over restricting velocity degrees of freedom in the corners of the domain. Nitsche’s method

for weak boundary imposition was used to avoid this problem, also alleviating the necessity for highly
reﬁned meshes to reproduce layer effects on no-slip boundaries [10].
The weak imposition of boundary conditions introduces terms to the operator B1 (w, u) and L(w)
to ﬁnally have them as in the following equations, where αP = Cpen /hf and Cpen are the penalty
term parameters, hf is the wall normal mesh size, making the bilinear operator mesh-dependent [3].
In each equation, consistency comes from the weak formulation of the problem, adjoint consistency
comes from applying the adjoint operator to the consistency term, and penalisation is the term weighing
velocity boundary condition u = h [3].

Implementation

The implementation of the concept of discrete spaces was built on top of the framework for high performance isogeometric analysis PetIGA, that provides high order, high continuity discretizations. Modiﬁcations to some structures were required so the framework could handle different discretization spaces
for each variable. The implementation of Piola’s transformation and integral-preserving transformation
was also requeried to get divergence free discretization in the physical space. We ran all the test cases
on a workstation (2 Hex-core Xeon X5650, 48 Gb memory).

Test problems

Heat driven square cavity

Figure 3: Heat driven cavity domain

The heat driven square cavity was used as a test case for our 2D formulation. This test presents a
high temperature TH on the right side wall, and a low temperature TC on the left side wall. The top
and bottom walls are considered to be adiabatic. No-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions are
considered on every wall for the velocity [4, 7], showing how the ﬂow is driven only by the density
changes due to the heat transfer from the right to the left wall. When the velocity ﬂow is low, isothermal
lines appear as parallel to the walls, but when the velocity increases isothermal lines begin to skew
towards the direction of the velocity due to the advective effects included in energy equation.

Variation of different parameters on equations (1) were computed to analize the behavior of the
results. Common ﬂuid parameters like α, μ, γ, λ and j were kept constant, the variation of the material
parameter K = κ/μ to values of 0, 0.5 and 2, and Ra = grβ(TH − TC )/να to values of 1e4 , 5e4 , 1e5 ,
5e5 were computed and compared with results from [4]. Table 1 presents streamlines results, Table 2

Results presented for the heat driven square cavity correspond to the ones registered by Zadravecet
et al. [4], showing same behavior for Rayleigh numbers up to 1e5 . Higher Rayleigh numbers could not
be acheived with the same mesh due to the lack of implementation of an advection stabilization method.
All of the results obtained a maximum divergence value of order 1e−9 according to the formulation used
and the relative tolerance used in the nonlinear solver.

Heat driven arc cavity

The heat driven arc cavity was used as a test case for our divergence conserving mapping formulation.
This test case presents a high temperature TH on the bottom curved wall, and a low temperature TC on
the upper curved wall. The straight walls are considered to be adiabatic. No-slip and no-penetration
boundary conditions are considered on every wall for the velocity as used in the heat driven square
cavity.

Results for the heat driver arc cavity were not compared with any reported results. Streamlines show
how ﬂuid ﬂows from the hot to the cold wall creating a big vortex around the cold wall and a small
one around the upper part of the hot wall, this generates a higher temperature area close to the straight
left wall created by the advective effects of hot ﬂuid coming from both vortex, ﬂowing into that speciﬁc
area. Isothermal lines appear more skewed towards the cold wall due to the advection presented by the
big vortex.

Conclusions

From the linear momentum equation we can see that in the absence of any other external force, as in
the heat driven cavity problems, buoyancy is the only factor that drives the movement of the ﬂuid. This
is observed by noting that the temperature gradient between hot and cold walls is the only driving force
for the ﬂuid in both test cases.
Among the results from varying the physical parameters of the equations we found that with higher
Rayleigh number, as expected, velocity increases which leads to higher effects from advective terms
in the model, as seen in isothermal lines. Lack of stabilization for advection kept us from going to
higher Rayleigh numbers with the same mesh. As the parameter of K is increased, velocity magnitude
decreases rendering straighter isothermal lines due to smaller advection effects.
Divergence-free solutions were achieved point-wise due to the selection of our basis functions to
create a divergence conformal space. This guarantees the mass conservation along the domain and an
accurate solution of the ﬂow, allowing the analysis to focus on the effect of introducing the microrotation
conservation equation and how its coupling with the Navier-Stokes equations affects the results. Weak
imposition of boundary conditions presents accurate results when focusing on ﬂow near boundaries,
while avoiding instabilites due to over restricting velocity degrees of freedom.

Future Work

Future work is to include advection stabilization with the VMS method [10], allowing us to go to higher
Rayleigh and Reynolds numbers depending on boundary conditions. Going to 3D and the use of different geometries will be part of coming works, looking also for benchmarks to validate thoroughly
our implementation. We will also look into including the effect over the ﬂuid properties of adding
nanoparticles, and also the addition of a transport equation for the nanoparticles in the transient case.
