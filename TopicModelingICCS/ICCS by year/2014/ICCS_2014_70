Abstract
Single-molecule tracking data near solid surfaces contains information on diﬀusion that is potentially aﬀected by adsorption. However, molecular adsorption can occur in an intermittent
manner, and the overall phenomenon is regarded as slower yet normal diﬀusion if the time
scale of each adsorption event is suﬃciently shorter than the interval of data acquisition. We
compare simple numerical model systems that vary in the time scale of adsorption event while
sharing the same diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and show that the shape of the displacement distribution
depends on the time resolution. We also evaluate the characteristics by statistical quantities
related to the large deviation principle.

Introduction

Diﬀusion of small objects such as biomolecules in ﬂuid near a solid surface is known to diﬀer from
the bulk diﬀusion [1]. Brownian motion of single-stranded DNA molecules labelled with marker
molecules has been experimentally observed by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy
(TIRF) technique [2, 3]. Diﬀusion coeﬃcients near the substrate surfaces were substantially
smaller than that expected from bulk consideration [4]. Surface eﬀects such as hydrodynamic
wall eﬀects [5–10] and the molecular behaviour of water in the vicinity of the solid surface [11]
are thought to contribute to the slow down of diﬀusion. Furthermore, adsorptive eﬀects may
also contribute. Diﬀusion and adsorption of DNA in solution to the substrate surface has been
studied since it is important for the application of self-assembly to the engineering [12–14].
Intuitively, the eﬀect of adsorption of molecules in solution to a solid wall is expected to
lead to negligible displacement. However, there can also be the case that the adsorption takes
place for short duration compared to the time resolution of observation by high-speed camera
mounted onto microscope system. If the duration of adsorption is short, it is usually regarded

as negligible. However, the slow down of the diﬀusion by this adsorption event can be noticeable
if the frequency of the event is suﬃciently high. Thus, the adsorptive eﬀect of solid surface on
the Brownian motion of molecules is not intrinsically of all-or-nothing nature. In this article,
we focus on the intermittency of the adsorption phenomena. We consider simple numerical
model to represent the diﬀusion accompanied by intermittent adsorption events, and show how
the time scale of adsorbed and diﬀusing states aﬀects the displacement at ﬁnite frame intervals
of observation, while sharing the same diﬀusion coeﬃcients.

Computational model and method
Model of Brownian motion with intermittent adsorption

We deﬁne a one-dimensional model of diﬀusion combined with intermittent adsorption onto a
solid surface. The molecule of interest is either in solution or adsorbed on a ﬂat solid surface.
Brownian motion in the direction parallel to the solid surface is discussed. The molecule
undergoes a Wiener process in the “diﬀusing state”:
Δx =

2Dp Δt · ξ,

(1)

where Δx, Dp , Δt and ξ are the displacement, diﬀusion coeﬃcient within the diﬀusing state,
time increment of the dynamics and Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, respectively. On the other hand, the solute molecule does not undergo observable displacement in the “adsorbed state”:
Δx = 0.

(2)

The duration of the diﬀusing state tdiﬀuse between adsorbed states is deﬁned to be exponentially
distributed based on the probability density:
pExp (tdiﬀuse ) =

tdiﬀuse
1
exp −
τ
τ

,

(3)

where τ is the mean duration of a diﬀusing state. The duration of a continuous adsorbed state
is deﬁned to be constant. It should be noted that we place emphasis on the simplicity here
in order to make the essence clear. We do not intend to uncover all of the signiﬁcant factors
for the slow down of diﬀusion of a molecule in solution in the vicinity of solid surface, but we
focus solely on the inﬂuence of time scale of intermittent adsorption on the time-series data of
displacements that is captured by ﬁnite frame intervals.
We deﬁne the typical time scale T = 10−2 s in order to use nondimensionalized quantities.
We consider the frame interval of Tframe = 1. The model deﬁnition with relevant time scales is
schematically shown in Fig. 1. The time step of the dynamics itself is deﬁned as Δt = 10−2 . The
total number of steps to generate the trajectory is ntotal = 106 . The duration of a continuous
adsorbed state is always deﬁned to be the same as the mean duration τ of the diﬀusing state. In
other words, the time fraction R of the adsorbed state in the overall dynamics is 0.5 regardless of
τ after suﬃcient duration of sampling. We keep R ﬁxed, and we consider three physical systems;
τ = 0.1, 1, and 10. We study how the diﬀerence of τ is reﬂected on the the displacement
characteristics at the resolution of Tframe . The unit of length scale is deﬁned as L = 10−6 m,
and the nondimensional diﬀusion coeﬃcient during the diﬀusing state is deﬁned as Dp = 1.

either in the adsorbed or diﬀusing states, and the state changes stochastically. The duration of
a diﬀusing state is exponentially distributed but the mean duration is τ , which is the same as
a continuous adsorbed state. All of the parameters in the ﬁgure are displayed with superscript
“d”, indicating that they are quantities with dimension. Δt is the time increment to generate
the trajectory. The frame interval Tframe is deﬁned to be Tframe = 102 Δt, and three cases
τ = 10Δt, 102 Δt, and 103 Δt of physical systems are considered.

Data analysis based on the large deviation principle

The rate function S(u) in the large deviation principle is deﬁned as follows:
S(u) = −

lim

Tspan →∞

1
Tspan

ln P (¯
u(Tspan ) ∈ [u, u + du]),

(4)

where u¯(Tspan ) is the ﬁnite-time mean of the stochastic variable of interest for the period of
Tspan , and P is the probability of u
¯(Tspan ) taking the values between u and u + du. The rate
function indicates how fast the probability of u¯(Tspan ) taking the speciﬁc values of u other than
the expected values converges to zero as the number of samples Tspan are increased. In case
of Gaussian random variable, the rate function is known to take parabolic shape [15]. As we
cannot have inﬁnite amount of data, we consider a kind of approximation. First, we consider
the absolute value Uj (i) of displacement Δx per time step Δt by splitting the ntotal = 106
sequence of time series data into nens sets, each of which consists of nspan steps and deﬁne

We have previously shown that this analysis uncovers the characteristics of anisotropy in the
Brownian motion of prolate particles [16] and the motility of model bacteria [17]. In particular,
characteristic time scale of the dynamics can be revealed from χ(0, nspan , nens ) as a function of
nspan [17].

Results and discussion

The time-series data of displacement per Δt for diﬀerent conditions of τ are shown in Fig. 2(a).
The data is numerically generated by the rule deﬁned in Section 2.1. Namely, the mean duration
of continuous diﬀusing state is deﬁned to be equal to the duration of single adsorption state τ ,
and each of the diﬀusion duration is exponentially distributed. Although diﬀerence in Fig. 2(a)

Figure 3: (a) Histograms of displacements per Δt = 10−2 , corresponding to Fig.2(a). The
fraction of the time steps of zero displacement is R = 0.5. The ﬁniteness of bin width for the
histogram leads to slightly larger value besides statistical error. (b) Histograms of displacements

for the histogram is (ntotal Δt)/Tframe = 104 for all the conditions of τ .

is qualitatively recognized, the mean square displacements (MSDs) are the same for all of the
three cases as shown in Fig. 2(b). It means that the dynamics of τ = 0.1, 1, and 10 share the
same one-dimensional diﬀusion coeﬃcient D since the slope of MSD corresponds to it:
1
|x(t) − x(0)|2 ,

where x(t) and are the position at time t and the ensemble average, respectively. Furthermore,
the model has a characteristic that displacement distribution at the resolution of Δt = 10−2 is
the same regardless of the adsorption duration as shown in Fig. 3(a). These characteristics are
realized by keeping the time fraction of unit adsorption duration R in the overall dynamics to
be 0.5 regardless of τ , which leads to the overall diﬀusion coeﬃcient D = Dp /2.
However, the diﬀerence of the characteristic time scale τ is reﬂected on the displacement
distribution at coarser time resolution. Figure 3(b) shows the histogram of displacement per
frame interval Tframe . Whereas the displacement distribution at the resolution Δt shown in
Fig. 3(a) is the superposition of Gaussian distribution and the sharp peak at zero, the displacement distribution at the resolution of Tframe is diﬀerent. The coarser time resolution means that
a displacement is a sum of ﬁnite time steps. In this case, it is because Tframe = 102 Δt. Central
limit theorem suggests that the sample mean of independent and identically distributed stochastic variable converges to the Gaussian distribution in the limit of inﬁnite amount of data. The
data shown in Fig. 3(b) consists of ﬁnite amount of data, and the distribution is not completely
Gaussian. The central limit theorem tells the convergence to Gaussian for inﬁnite amount of
data, but it does not tell the speed of convergence. The diﬀerence in the speed of convergence
for diﬀerent τ is reﬂected on the displacement distribution in Fig. 3(b). This might be related
to our recent experimental result [3]. We not only obtained the substantially slower diﬀusion
of DNA near glass substrate compared to the bulk, but also found that the hydrodynamic wall
eﬀect [5, 6] is not suﬃcient to thoroughly explain it. Although the displacement distribution at

a frame rate of 100 fps looked roughly Gaussian shape when the substrates had been cleaned
with KOH solution with suﬃciently high concentration, it might have included the eﬀect of
intermittent adsorption with τ much shorter than Tframe .
The speed of convergence to Gaussian distribution as the number of samples (i.e., the frame
interval) increases is related to the characteristic time scale τ of intermittency. In order to
evaluate it from diﬀerent criteria, we consider the statistical quantities related to the large
deviation principle. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the numerical values of the approximated rate
function for speciﬁc absolute values of displacements are larger for the data of shorter τ . This
indicates that convergence of ﬁnite sample mean to the expected value is faster for the shorter
τ . This is related to the result of displacement distribution of Fig. 3(b). If the time fraction of
the adsorbed state R in the overall dynamics is deﬁned to be zero, the dynamics reduces to a
Wiener process, and the rate function becomes parabolic shape, corresponding to the Gaussian
distribution of displacements. In case R = 1, the probability of zero displacement is 1.
The displacements in the diﬀusing state are generated by 2Dp Δt · ξ using the Gaussian
random variable ξ with zero mean and unit variance, Dp = 1, and Δt = 10−2 . The expected
value of |ξ| is 2/π, and the time fraction of the diﬀusing state is 1 − R = 0.5. Therefore, the
expected value of the absolute value of displacement is 2Dp Δt · (2/π)/2 ≈ 5.6 × 10−2 . All of
the curves in Fig. 4(a) share the property that the approximated rate function is zero at the mean
value of the sampled data. This is consistent with the original deﬁnition of the rate function
Eq.4 since the probability of taking the expected value converges to 1 as Tspan → ∞. However,
as discussed in the previous study [17], approximated forms of large deviation quantities based
on the ﬁnite amount of data instead of inﬁnite limit can depend on nspan . There are cases that
the dependence can be used for the distinction of data when there is a characteristic time scale
for the dynamics. As shown in Fig. 4(b), χ(0) as a function of nspan shows clear dependence of
τ . Deviation from χ(0) for τ = 10 with increasing nspan starts around nspan = 101 and 102 for
τ = 0.1 and 1, respectively. nspan = 101 and 102 correspond to the characteristic time scales τ .

Concluding remarks

The displacement distribution obtained from the single-molecule tracking depends on the time
resolution determined by the frame interval of the video capturing in the experiments. We have
shown by numerical model that the shape of displacement distribution does not necessarily
indicate the fraction of intermittent adsorption time alone but it also reﬂects the characteristic
time scale of adsorption as well. There can be situations where the fraction of adsorption time
in the overall dynamics is signiﬁcant but the durations of each adsorption events are much
shorter than the frame intervals of image capturing. Therefore, when the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
is substantially smaller than that estimated from the hydrodynamic wall eﬀect and non-bulk
physical characteristics of surrounding ﬂuid, there is a possibility that the adsorptive eﬀect exists
even if the displacement distribution observed at a speciﬁc frame rate is close to Gaussian shape.
