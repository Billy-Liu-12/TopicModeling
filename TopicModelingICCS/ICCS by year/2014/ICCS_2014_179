Abstract
For the simulation of wave propagation problems, it is necessary to truncate the computational
domain. Perfectly Matched Layers are often employed for that purpose, especially in high
contrast layered materials where absorbing boundary conditions are diﬃcult to design. In here,
we deﬁne a Perfectly Matched Layer that automatically adjusts its parameters without any user
interaction. The user only has to indicate the desired decay in the surrounding layer. With this
Perfectly Matched Layer, we show that even in the most complex scenarios where the material
contrast properties are as high as sixteen orders of magnitude, we do not introduce numerical
reﬂections when truncating the domain, thus, obtaining accurate solutions.

Introduction

When applying hp-adaptivity for the Finite Element Method (FEM) [6] in open region problems
the computational domain has to be truncated. In particular, it is crucial for wave equations
problems, which typically exhibit oscillating solutions with slow decay. If we attempt to truncate the computational domain by reducing the domain size via a change of coordinates from
an inﬁnite domain to a ﬁnite one, the solution oscillates more and more when approaching
the boundary, and these oscillations are hardly reproduced by numerical methods. If we just
truncate the domain without using carefully designed boundary conditions, then we observe
non-physical reﬂections coming from the boundary.
In 1994, in a seminal paper of Berenger [2], Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) were proposed
in an electromagnetic context as an artiﬁcial layer intended to reduce reﬂections from the

boundary of a truncated computational domain. A new interpretation of PMLs was introduced
by Teixera and Chew [5, 16], where also in the context of electromagnetic phenomena, they
interpreted a PML as a change of coordinates into the complex plane.
PMLs transform propagating and evanescent waves into exponentially fast decaying evanescent waves. Because of the high attenuation of the waves into the PML region, we can impose
some boundary conditions (BC) (typically homogeneous Dirichlet BC) on the outer part of the
PML without introducing appreciable reﬂections. For a further understanding and for a recent
review of the state of the art of this truncation technique, we refer to [3] and [9].
When implementing PMLs, one has to select the decay proﬁle of the wave into the PML
region. Selecting a proﬁle that produces arbitrarily small reﬂections implies that the solution
also decays arbitrarily fast, which produces a “boundary layer” and strong gradients in the
region. Thus, while a low decay produces incoming waves reﬂected from the boundary, an
excessive decay requires a very ﬁne grid. To ﬁnd an equilibrium between a fast and a slow
decay, it is necessary to properly adjust the PML parameters, which is usually tricky since they
depend on the problem itself. Moreover, when we have a layered material with high contrasts
on the material properties, this selection of the parameters is even more challenging.
The main contribution of this work is to provide a method to automatically adjust the PML
parameters, even in the most complex scenarios where the material contrast properties among
neighbouring materials are as high as sixteen orders of magnitude. These type of scenarios often
appear in geophysical electromagnetic (EM) applications that involve both, air and ground.
We show using a two dimensional (2D) magnetotelluric (MT) [4, 17, 14] application that the
proposed PML produces an appropriate decay of the solution in the air and in the subsurface
without introducing spurious reﬂections, and thus, it provides accurate solutions.
The present work is organized as follows. In Section 2 we deﬁne the mathematical problem
to be solved. Section 3 describes the formulation of the PML and how the parameters to be
tuned in the PML are automatically adjusted. Numerical results based on the MT problem are
illustrated in Section 4 and Section 5 is devoted to the conclusions.

Model Problem

In this work, we study this automatically adapted PML in context of MTs.

2.1

MT Method

The MT is a passive EM exploration technique intended to estimate the resistivity distribution,
and therefore provide an image of the subsurface on scales varying from few meters to hundreds
of kilometers [18]. MT measurements can be described by Maxwell’s equations, with the source
located at the ionosphere. In particular, when the electrical ﬁeld depends only upon two
spatial variables (x, z), we can derive two uncoupled modes from Maxwell’s equations, namely,
Transverse Electric (TE), which involves (Ey , Hx , Hz ) electric and magnetic ﬁeld components,
and Transverse Magnetic (TM), which involves (Hy , Ex , Ez ).
We focus on the E-Formulation, where the equation for the y component can be expressed
as
(1)
− μ−1 ΔEy − k2 Ey = −jωJyimp ,
where k2 = ω 2 ε − jωσ, Ey is the y-component of the electric ﬁeld driven by an impressed
prescribed density current Jyimp , ω is the angular frequency and σ (a diagonal second rank
tensor) stands for the conductivity of the media. For the range of frequencies involving the MT

problem, the electrical permittivity ε and the magnetic permeability μ can be assumed to be
that of the vacuum (ε0 and μ0 respectively).
Using an hp-Finite Element Method [6], we compute the electric ﬁeld Ey . Our aim is
to obtain the impedance and/or the apparent resistivity, two suitable physical magnitudes to
perform the inversion. To do so, the magnetic ﬁeld is obtained from Maxwell’s equations,
namely:
1 ∂Ey
Hx =
.
(2)
jωμ ∂z
The impedance Zyx and the apparent resistivity ρa are then computed using the following
formulas:
Ey

Zyx =

(3)
ρa =

2.2

Variational Formulation

For the sake of simplicity in the notation, we omit the y subscript from Ey and Jyimp . Thus,
to obtain the corresponding variational formulation we multiply equation (1) by the complex
conjugate of a test function F ∈ V (Ω), where V (Ω) = HΓ1D (Ω) = {F ∈ L2 (Ω) : F |ΓD = 0, ∇F ∈
L2 (Ω)} is the space of admissible test functions. Then, we integrate by parts and incorporate
the homogeneous Dirichlet BC (the ones considered in the present work) over ΓD = ∂Ω, and
we obtain that

where E D is a lift (typically E D = 0) of the essential boundary condition data denoted with
the same symbol. With the state scalar-valued solution function E, we compute Li (E), a linear
and continuous functional [12, 11] in E associated to the i-th receiver and deﬁned as:
Li (E) =

where ΩRi is the domain occupied by the i-th receiver.

PML Formulation

Chew and Weedom [5] showed that a PML can be understood as a complex-coordinate stretching
of Maxwell’s equations. With this interpretation, the PML is simply an analytic continuation
of the governing equations into the complex plane (see also [15]).

3.1

Variational Formulation in an Arbitrary System of Coordinates

Let the Cartesian coordinate system x = (x, z) = (x1 , x2 ) be the reference system of coordinates. Given an arbitrary system of coordinates ζ = (ζ1 , ζ2 ), we deﬁne our change of coordinates
by x = ψ(ζ) and we denote the Jacobian matrix and its determinant by J and det(J ), respectively. The change of coordinates is assumed to be an injective diﬀerentiable function with
972

continuous partial derivatives and nonzero determinant at any point. The corresponding variational formulation for the TE mode, in the new system of coordinates, can be obtained as
follows.
Let E = E(x) and F = F (x) be an arbitrary scalar-valued functions. Since they are
analytical functions, we extend them to the complex plane. We denote E := E ◦ ψ = E(ζ)
and F := F ◦ ψ = F (ζ). Additionally, we deﬁne μ := μ ◦ ψ, k := k ◦ ψ, J imp := J imp ◦ ψ,
Ω := Ω ◦ ψ, and ΓD := ΓD ◦ ψ.
Multiplying equation (1) by the complex conjugate of a test function F , integrating by parts,
and incorporating the homogeneous Dirichlet BC over ΓD = ∂ Ω, we obtain that:

The new source and material tensors incorporate the information about the change of coordinates. Thus, the variational formulation can be expressed in terms of an arbitrary system of
coordinates by simply considering the new source and materials. The new variational formulation, in the new system of coordinates is:

coordinate, of the type

Automatic Adjustment of PML Parameters

Given the general change of coordinates (10), we select
h(xi ) =

1,

xi < xai

φi ∈ C ,

xi ∈ [xai , xbi ),

(13)

where [xai , xbi ) deﬁne the position of the PML in the positive direction of the i-th coordinate.
If the space far from the region of interest is linear, homogeneous, and the problem is timeharmonic, the radiating solution for some wave equation is a sum of plane waves, and may be
decomposed into functions of the form of e−jκxi (see [8]), where κ = ω 2 μ − jωμσ is the wave
number and xi is the direction of propagation of the wave.
We consider the worse scenario, that is, a plane wave traveling perpendicularly to the PML
towards the positive direction of the xi variable (an analogous analysis can be done for the
negative direction). Then, the solution in the PML region for the new variable is given by
E(ζ(xi )) = e−jκζ(xi ) = e−jκφi xi .

(14)

Our aim is to make the solution to vanish in the PML region without introducing reﬂections.
Therefore, we deﬁne the decay factor α, which measures the decay of the solution from xai to
xbi , as
b
a
E(xbi )
= e−jκφi (xi −xi ) .
(15)
α :=
E(xai )
Then,

log(α) = −jκφi (xbi − xai )

(16)

and ﬁnally, we select
φi = j

log(α)
.
κ(xbi − xai )

(17)

Remark. Notice that with this formula we obtain an automatic adjustment of the PML parameters. The user does not have to take care about the formation material within each area, even

if they change abruptly. On the other hand, diﬀerent size for the PML can be considered in
each side of each variable. The only user interaction is to deﬁne the desired decay into the PML
region, i.e., α. Then, φi is automatically computed guaranteeing a decay in the outer part of
the PML according to the selected α.

Numerical Results

This automatically adjusted PML is suitable for a variety of problems where the material
contrast properties among neighbouring materials are large. In particular, we will study its
impact into our MT model problem.

4.1

Model Problem

We assume a horizontally layered earth model where some 2D inhomogeneities may appear.
The TE mode is driven by the impressed electric density current Jimp = ωy. We model the
source as an inﬁnitely long (in x and y directions) volumetric rectangular surface located at the
ionosphere. This allows us to treat the electromagnetic ﬁelds as plane waves that propagate in
the vertical direction towards the Earth’s surface [17].
The physical problem is illustrated in Figure 1. The computational domain in consideration,
of 2500 × 130 km. consist of air and a layered media (eventually with a scatter) for modelling
the subsurface formation. The horizontal dimension corresponds to the x spatial variable (with
zero at the center), and the vertical to the z (with zero on the surface). The physical domain is
surrounded by a PML. The relative permittivity and permeability are the same in all materials,
and equal to one. The receivers are located at the Earth’s surface and are represented with red
crosses, while the source, located at the ionosphere is represented with the dark blue rectangle.
When the media is only 1D dependent (invariant in x), the solution along the surface is constant
(x and y independent), and therefore, it is suﬃcient to consider only one receiver. However,
when 2D inhomogeneities are considered, we are interested in having the solution at diﬀerent
positions. We consider four diﬀerent formation of the subsurface described in Table 1. The

Figure 1: Model problem.
exact solution for a 1D layered media is known (see for example [13, 7]). For numerical results,
we calculate the electric ﬁeld solving (1). In a layered media problem we use a multigoal-oriented
hp-FEM [10, 1], which ensures accurate solutions at all receivers.

Validation of the Solution

We ﬁrst ensure that our automatically adapted PML provides accurate solutions for a range
of frequencies. We consider a 5 km. PML in all directions. The mesh in each direction of the
PML region is depicted in Figure 2. The number of elements into the PML region represents
15.5% of the total amount of elements. We deﬁne a decay factor of α = 10−5 , ensuring that

Formation with a Target/Scatter

We consider a 2D inhomogeneity located at the center of the domain inside the layer corresponding to ρ2 . The horizontal length of this target is 10 km. and we denote its resistivity with

apparent resistivity at diﬀerent distances from the center of the domain for a range of frequencies. Position 1 corresponds to the center of the domain, which coincides with the center of the
target. The eﬀect of the target is more notorious there, and as expected, we measure higher
resistivities at this point than elsewhere.
Our capacity to detect the target lies on our capability to capture the inhomogeneities in the
solution. This fact depends on the considered frequency. For example, for ω = 10−1 we cannot
detect any inhomogeneity because all our measurements are almost the same everywhere. On
the other hand, if our aim is to detect the target, ω = 10−3 Hz. is the more appropriate
frequency to consider. For this frequency, we represent in Figure 6 (right) the solution along
the surface for the three diﬀerent problems described in Table 2. In there, we appreciate how
our solution is sensitive to the presence of the target. In particular, we observe that the solution
is more aﬀected when the receiver is closer to the target, as expected.

Conclusions

To ﬁnd an equilibrium between a fast and a slow decay on the PML region is usually tricky. It
depends on the problem itself and it is even more complicated when there exists high contrasts
on adjacent material properties. We have shown that in these complicated scenarios, the Automatically Adapted PML provides an adequate decay, not so fast to require a too ﬁne grid and
not so slow to introduce artiﬁcial reﬂections.

We have shown that once the decay in the PML is deﬁned, the PML parameters are automatically tuned without any additional user interaction according to the layer widths, providing
accurate solutions for the MT problem.
