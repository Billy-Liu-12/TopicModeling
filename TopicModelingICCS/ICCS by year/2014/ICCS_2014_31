Abstract
A computational study of the compound containing selenium, 2-selenobarbituric acid, has been
carried out. Tautomerism has been studied not only in neutral forms but also in the protonated and
deprotonated species. The most stable tautomers for neutral and deprotonated species are equivalent to
those obtained by different authors for the analogous barbituric and 2-thiobarbituric acids. However,
the most stable tautomer for the protonated 2-selenobarbituric acid differs of that proposed for the
analogous compounds. The enthalpy of formation in the gas phase, and the gas-phase acidity and
basicity of 2-selenobarbituric acid have been calculated at the G3 and G4 levels, together with the
corresponding values for barbituric and 2-thiobarbituric acids. The calculated acidity shows that 2selenobarbituric acid is a very strong Brønsted acid in the gas phase.

1 Introduction
Selenium is an essential element in the human body and is present in what is commonly known as
the 21st natural amino acid, selenocysteine. Organoselenium compounds have attracted considerable
interest in organic and biochemical oxidation reactions [1]. Despite extensive experimental studies
with biologically relevant selenium compounds, it is not fully understood why selenium is such a
powerful antioxidant [2]. In humans, selenium is present in selenoproteins (containing selenocysteine
or selenomethionine), which act as antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and thyroid hormone
deiodinase). At trace levels, selenium is an essential element for animals and plants. Since many
selenium compounds can be toxic in higher amounts and the volatile members exhibit a characteristic
garlicky smell, selenium research was quite unattractive for more than 100 years after its discovery by
Berzelius [3]. The number of publications devoted to study Se-containing compounds is very much
smaller than those devoted to study compounds containing oxygen or sulfur. The chemistry and
intrinsic properties of compounds containing Se is not well known [4].

We have recently published experimental and computational thermochemical studies of barbituric
[5] and 2-thiobarbituric [6] acids. Following this topic we have carried out a computational study of
the analogous compound containing selenium, 2-selenobarbituric acid (SeBA), whose schematic
formula is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Schematic formula of the most stable neutral tautomer of 2-selenobarbituric acid.
Barbituric acid (BA) and 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA), as well as their derivatives, are very
important compounds in biological chemistry and medicine due to their pharmacological activity,
related mainly to tautomerism and acid-base equilibria [7]. They are interesting in the sense that they
can exhibit two kinds of tautomerism: the transfer of an imine hydrogen or a methylene hydrogen to a
keto oxygen (or sulfur in the case of 2-thiobarbituric acid). BA and TBA contain three functional
groups with mobile hydrogen atoms, one CH2 and two NH groups, and three potentially enolisable
groups that allow the existence of a large number of tautomers. There are 10 possible tautomeric forms
for barbituric and 2-thiobarbituric acids whose stabilities have been studied computationally [7-16].
All ab initio and DFT theoretical calculations report the triketo tautomer in barbituric acid (the 4,6diketo-2-thione tautomer in 2-thiobarbituric acid) to be the most stable one in the gas phase, followed
by the monohydroxy tautomers, 2,4-diketo-6-hydroxy and 2,6-diketo-4-hydroxy structures. The same
behavior is observed in solution. The higher stability of triketo form is associated with the much
stronger double bond of carbonyl group compared to the strength of the C=C and C=N bonds. The
high energy differences from the other tautomers suggest that the gas phase of BA and TBA consists
of a single molecular species, in agreement with experimental thermodynamic data [17,18].
Contrary to the case of BA and TBA, there is an almost complete lack of both experimental and
computational studies on 2-selenobarbituric acid. The synthesis of SeBA was published in 1959 [19].
Brunetti and Piacente measured the sublimation enthalpy in 1999 [15], and pointed that the vapor
pressure of SeBA is lower than those of BA or TBA. Finally, Alparone [20] has very recently
published a theoretical study computing the infrared, Raman, and electronic absorption spectra.
This work is a contribution to the knowledge of the structure and intrinsic properties of 2selenobarbituric acid. We have carried out a computational study exploring the conformational
analysis of the neutral, protonated and deprotonated tautomers, and calculating the enthalpy of
formation in the gas phase, and the gas-phase acidity and basicity, at high levels of theory.

2 Computational Details
Standard ab initio molecular orbital calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 [21] series
of programs. The energies of the different neutral, protonated, and deprotonated tautomers of 2selenobarbituric acid were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, and the most stable ones were
reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,p) level, including harmonic vibrational frequency
calculations.

The energies of the most stable tautomers of neutral, protonated, and deprotonated SeBA were
calculated using Gaussian-n theory, at the G3 [22] and G4 [23] levels.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Conformational Analysis
Tautomerism in barbituric acid [7-14] and 2-thiobarbituric acid [7,8,15,16] is a well characterized
phenomenon. All computations have established that in the gas phase the triketo and 4,6-diketo-2thione tautomers are the predominant forms of BA and TBA, respectively. The next most stable
tautomers are enolic (or thio-enolic), lying ca. 40 kJ·mol-1 above the most stable tautomer. Thus, it is
expected that in the gas phase only one tautomer is present, the others being of negligible importance.
To our knowledge, the tautomerism in 2-selenobarbituric acid has never been studied. Only the most
stable 4,6-diketo-2-selenone tautomer has recently been characterized by Alparone [20]. We have
studied the tautomerism in SeBA not only in its neutral forms but in its protonated and deprotonated
forms.

3.1.1 Neutral Forms
10 tautomeric neutral forms are possible for SeBA. They are collected in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Neutral forms of 2-selenobarbituric acid tautomers.
The tautomers are equivalent to those proposed by different authors for BA and TBA [7-16]. We
have followed the same nomenclature used by Zuccarello et al. [7] in their conformational study of the
tautomerism in BA and TBA. Each tautomer can have different rotamers, depending of the position of
the H atoms in the OH and SeH groups. So, the number of conformers studied for SeBA has been 30.
The relative gas-phase energies of SeBA tautomers with respect to the most stable one, calculated at
the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, are reported in Table 1. For each tautomer only the energy of the most
stable conformer has been taken into account. The relative energies calculated for the tautomers of
SeBA are very similar to those calculated at the same level of theory for the tautomers of TBA [15].
The most stable species were reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,p) level, and the gas-phase
Gibbs energies relative to the most stable tautomer are reported in Table 2.

The most stable neutral tautomer in the gas phase is predicted to be the 4,6-diketo-2-selenone (N1,
see Figure 3). There are two possible structures of N1, one of which has a planar ring conformation
characterized by C2v symmetry, and the other has an envelope conformation, characterized by Cs
symmetry. Similar structures were studied by Dorofeeva et al. [24] in the case of barbituric acid
carrying out calculations at MP2 and B3LYP levels with different basis sets. They found that BA is a
flexible molecule with planar equilibrium structure. N1 is followed by N10 (the 4-hydroxy-6-keto-2selenone species, Cs symmetry) and N6 (the 4,6-dihydroxy-2-selenol species, Cs symmetry), which are
at 35.5 and 47.5 kJ·mol-1, respectively (see Table 2). It suggests that the gas phase of 2selenobarbituric acid consists of a single form and therefore only the 4,6-diketo-2-selenone could be
detected by gas-phase electron diffraction. This behavior is similar to that observed in BA and TBA
[17,18,24].

3.1.2 Deprotonated Forms
A total of 14 possible tautomeric forms corresponding to the deprotonation of 2-selenobarbituric
acid have been studied. They are illustrated in Figure 4. The first nine are equivalent to those proposed
by Zuccarello et al. [7] for BA and TBA. The five new tautomers proposed correspond to the loss of
the two H atoms of the methylene group, and are less stable than the other species as expected.

Figure 4: Deprotonated forms of 2-selenobarbituric acid tautomers.
The tautomer A8 (C2v symmetry, see Figure 3), obtainable from N1 through elimination of a
proton from the methylene group, is the most stable among the possible anionic tautomers, followed
by A7 and A1 (both of Cs symmetry), at 43.4 and 44.3 kJ·mol-1, respectively (see Table 2). A1 is
obtainable from N1 through elimination of a proton from one of the NH groups; and the migration of a

hydrogen atom from C5 to the oxygen of the carbonyl group in A1 gives A7 tautomer (see Figure 5).
The results indicate the greater acid character of the C‒H versus the N‒H bond.

3.1.3 Protonated Forms
A total of 15 possible tautomeric forms corresponding to the protonation of 2-selenobarbituric acid
have also been studied. They are illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Protonated forms of 2-selenobarbituric acid tautomers.
Zuccarello et al. [7] proposed only 6 cationic species, similar to P1‒P6, for the protonation of BA
and TBA. In this work, an additional 9 possible protonated tautomers of SeBA have been proposed.

1361

The tautomer P10 (Cs symmetry, see Figure 3) is the most stable protonated isomer of 2selenobarbituric acid in the gas phase, followed by P3, P5, and P6 (all of them characterized by Cs
symmetry), at 19.5, 24.0, and 24.2 kJ·mol-1, respectively (see Table 2). Our result for SeBA disagrees
with Zuccarello et al. [7] who obtained P3 as the most stable protonated tautomer for BA and TBA
(they did not take into account the species P10, as it is indicated above). The migration of a hydrogen
atom from an NH to Se transforms tautomer P3 to P10 (see Figure 7). These results indicate that
tautomers protonated at the N atom are highly improbable in the gas phase (see Table 1).

3.2 Enthalpy of Formation in the Gas Phase
The standard procedure to obtain enthalpies of formation in Gaussian-n theories is through
atomization reactions. The procedure has been detailed in a previous work [25]. Values of -228.6 and
-226.3 kJ·mol-1 have been obtained for the enthalpy of formation of 2-selenobarbituric acid in the gas
phase, at the G3 and G4 levels, respectively. We can compare these values with the experimental
values measured for barbituric and 2-thiobarbituric acid (see Table 3). As it can be seen, the enthalpy
of formation increases in the order BA < TBA < SeBA, i. e., the stability decreases in the same order.
The enthalpic increment, i.e. the difference between the calculated enthalpies of formation of 2thiobarbituric and 2-selenobarbituric acids (51.6 kJ·mol-1 at G3, and 53.9 kJ·mol-1 at G4) is similar to
that calculated between thioformaldehyde and selenoformaldehyde (50.1 kJ·mol-1 at G3, and 53.2
kJ·mol-1 at G4). The substitution of a C=S group by a C=Se group in a molecule destabilizes it by ca.
53 kJ·mol-1.

the standard Gibbs energy and enthalpy changes, respectively, for reaction (1) in the gas phase:

GB and PA values calculated for 2-selenobarbituric acid, at the G3 and G4 levels, are collected in
Table 4, together with the corresponding values calculated for barbituric and 2-thiobarbituric acids.
The predicted basicities of TBA and SeBA are similar, both being ca. 15 kJ·mol-1 more basic than BA.
2-Thiobarbituric and 2-selenobarbituric acids are predicted to have an intrinsic basicity similar to that
of ammonia (GB = 819.9 and PA = 853.6 [26]).

AH (g) → A‒ (g) + H+ (g)
ΔGacid and ΔHacid values calculated for SeBA, at the G3 and G4 levels, are collected in Table 5,
together with the corresponding values calculated for BA and TBA. We have calculated the acidity at
two sites of the molecules. CH-acidity corresponds to the loss of one H atom of the methylene group
(tautomer A8), and NH-acidity to the loss of one H atom attached to the N atom (tautomer A7).
Results indicate that the C-H bond has a greater acid character.

The acidity increases (lower ΔGacid, higher acidity) in the order BA < TBA < SeBA. Contrarily to
the case of basicities, where TBA and SeBA have comparable values, 2-selenobarbituric acid is ca. 10
kJ·mol-1 more acidic than 2-thiobarbituric acid. This acidity enhancement is due to a specific
stabilization of the anion when O is replaced by S or Se. A similar behavior has recently been
observed in a computational study on the acidity of selenouracils [27]. The authors suggest that two
factors are responsible for the stabilization: a significant aromatization of the ring upon deprotonation
and a better dispersion of the excess electron density when the system contains third-row atoms.
The value predicted for the gas-phase acidity of 2-selenobarbituric acid shows that is a very strong
Brønsted acid in the gas phase, with an acidity comparable to that of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (ΔGacid =
1293 ± 8.4 kJ·mol-1 [28]) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (ΔGacid = 1291 ± 8.4 kJ·mol-1 [28]), and is close to the
so-called superacids, by definition a molecule in a given medium that is more acidic than H2SO4 in
that medium (the gas-phase acidity of sulfuric acid is ΔGacid = 1265 ± 10 kJ·mol-1 [29]).

4 Conclusions
Tautomerism in 2-selenobarbituric acid has been studied in its neutral, protonated and
deprotonated forms. The substitution of a C=S group by a C=Se group in the barbituric acid ring does
not affect the basicity of the molecule but the acidity is enhanced by ca. 10 kJ·mol-1 due to a specific
stabilization of the anion when S is replaced by Se. 2-Selenobarbituric acid is a very strong Brønsted
acid in the gas phase. A study on barbituric acid derivatives including more than one C=S and/or C=Se
groups in the ring is in progress with the aim of estimating the influence of the number of thiocarbonyl
and selenocarbonyl groups in the intrinsic properties of the molecules.
