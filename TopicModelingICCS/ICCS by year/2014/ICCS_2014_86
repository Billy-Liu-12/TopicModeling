Abstract
This study investigates the importance of the p-function used in the computational modeling. The
geometric changes of ReH7(PMe3)2 system is used as the model compound. 6-31G, 6-311G and 6311++G basis sets were used for all elements except Re, which used Christiansen et. al. basis set.
Upon removing the p-function on metal, we noticed the geometric changes are minimal as long as
triple-zeta basis sets are used for rest of elements. While the relative energy profile of a reaction
would still reasonably assemble each other, a direct comparison in energy between the basis set with
and without p-function is not recommended.

1 Introduction
There has been an argument of the necessity of p-orbital existence in the bonding of
transition metal compounds. The core of such argument lies in the generally known as eighteenelectron (18) rule. Similar to the Lewis Octet (8-electron) rule for main group compounds, this 18electron rule was first introduced by Langmuir in 1921 who illustrated the rule using transition metal
carbonyl compound such as M(CO)4-6 (M= Mo, Fe and Ni [Langmuir, 1921]). Bose [Bose, 1926]
and Reiff [Reiff, 1931] later further supported this 18-electron rule with cyanide and nitrosyl
compounds. However, it was not until Sidgwich and Bailey officially introduced the electron counting
rules in 1934 [Sidgwich, 1934]. Pauling’s electroneutrality principle [Pauling, 1960], Dewar bonding
model [Mingos, 2001] and symmetry based molecular orbital analysis [Orgel, 1962] were developed
to explain and formulate the bonding structure between the metal and ligands. To illustrate this 18electron rule, the molecular orbital diagram of an octahedral ML6 model is shown in Figure 1.
In this figure, the red box encapsulates the molecular orbitals that provide the theoretical
basis for the origin of 18-electron rule. According to the group theory, the metal atomic (n-1)d orbitals
translate into Eg and T2g set in octahedral geometry, ns orbitals translate into A1g and np orbitals
translate into T1u set; while six σ-atomic orbital group from the ligand yield A1g, Eg and T1u set. These

The Impact of p-orbital on Optmization of ReH7(PMe3)2 Compound

Elechi et al.

atomic orbitals eventually yield A1g, Eg, T1u and T2g molecular orbitals shown in the red box, which
gives 18-electron count. As one can see, the T2g set from metal is depicted as non-bonding here due to
no counterpart atomic orbital combinations from the ligand’s σ-only atomic orbital group; it will
become bonding orbitals when the π-atomic orbitals combination of ligand are used. Therefore,
depending on the strength of the π-bond interactions between the ligand and the metal, the so-called
exception of 18-electron rule varies from 12-electron count to 18-electron count [Minos, 2004].
Despite the warning from Maseras and Morokuma [Maseras, 1992] that natural population
analysis (NPA) output is strongly dependent on whether a set of formally empty metal p orbitals were
used or not, Weinhold and Landis have been advocating the overthrow of 18-electron rule and
replacing it with 12-electron rule based on NPA results [Weinhold, 2005]. Contrary to Frenking
[Frenking, 2000] and Hall’s analysis [Bayse, 1999], Landis considered the p-valence orbitals in
transition metal were not available and made it more appropriate to consider sdn (n=1-5)
hybridization, which gives the basis for 12-electron count [Landis, 1998]. Furthermore, Pyykkö
argued that a p-like molecular orbital with one nodal surface is not necessarily needed from the metal
in order to make a good bonding. In his argument, he proposed that closed-shell electron structures are

driven by the bonding contributions to the center and by the kinetic-energy (nodal-structure) terms
from the ligands. This would impose a filling order of s<p<d, even for the transition metal systems.
This would result in 18-electron rule even without any np contributions at the central atom. As Hall
pointed out, [Bayse, 1999] the energies of the valence orbitals in heavier main group elements are ns
< np << nd. Therefore it is justified to exclude d orbitals in the electron counting. However, in the
transition metal elements, the energies of the valence orbitals are ns ~ (n-1)d < np. The energy
separation between the (n-1)d and np is not big enough to justify excluding the p orbitals completely
in the electron counting in transition metal compounds. In this study, we will study the geometric and
energetic of various transition metal systems in order to shed some lights on the importance and
involvements of p-orbital in the 18-electron rule.
In this study ReH7(PMe3)2 system was optimized with two different basis sets on metal Re
and three different basis set on rest of elements. The results were compared to investigate the
importance of these p-orbitals.

2 Computational details
All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 suite [Gaussian 2009] implementation of
density functional theory (DFT). The geometric structures of all species were optimized in the gas
phase at B3LYP [Staroverov, 2003]. Since this study focuses on the sensitivity of p-functions, we
chose Christiansen et. al. basis sets for metal, which have a larger basis set with small relativistic
effective core potential (ECP) and a small basis set with large relativistic effective core potentials
[Ross, 1986; Hurley, 1986; LaJohn , 1987; Ermler, 1991; Ross,1990]. These basis sets were obtained
from Basis Set Exchange website [Feller,1996; Schuchardt,2007]. Christiansen basis sets were chosen
because these basis sets have small and large basis sets and could afford us (a) the comparison when
removing the p-function from the smaller basis set and (b) the comparison the results between the
smaller and bigger basis sets. For the sake of discussion, Christiansen’s small basis set with larger
ECP is defined as BS-I. After removing the p-function from this small basis set is defined as BS-II.
The large basis set with smaller ECP is defined as BS-III. 6-311++G [Clark, 1983], 6-311G [McLean,
1980; Raghavachari, 2980] and 6-31G [Ditchfield, 1971] basis sets were used for all other atoms. All
structures were fully optimized and the harmonic vibrational frequency calculations were performed
separately to ensure a minimum was achieved. The thermodynamic functions, including gas-phase
free energies, zero point energy, enthalpies, and free energies, were calculated at 298.15 K and 1 atm
within the harmonic potential approximation at optimized structures.

3 Results and discussion
Since the key to understand 18-electron rule or the proposed 12-electron rule is based on the
participation of p-orbital in the transition metal complexes, this study will focus on electronic and
geometric structure changes between results using p-orbitals (BS-I) and those without the p-orbitals
(BS-II). ReH7(PMe3)2 complex is selected because of its simplicity, yet the selection of three different
basis sets on hydrides can afford us to investigate the dependency of LCAO of these hydrides in
conjunction of three basis sets on the metal. Because the hydrides do not have the p-orbital to interfere
with the investigation of p-orbitals on metal, the P-Re-P bond angle would also be a good indicator for
the sensitivity of basis set changes. Therefore, we will investigate the geometric changes such as PRe-P bond angle changes, as well as Re-H bond length changes with difference basis sets applied. We
will also investigate the sensitivity of energy vs basis set with double reductive elimination product
ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2.

3.1 Impact on P-Re-P bond angle
For the sake of clarity and visualization effect, the hydrogen atoms on the PMe3 group are
not shown in Figure 2. One can see there are two types of hydrides bonded to Re atom. There are four
hydrides that sit beneath the Re as Re-Hbase, while three hydride atoms sit above the Re as Re-Htop. As
a matter of fact, two of hydride atoms and two P atoms form another pseudo-square plane that sits on
the top of the four-hydrides-base, but rotates 45°.

Figure 2. Optimized geometry of ReH7(PMe3)2 with BS and 6-311++G basis set

As shown in Table 1, the optimized geometric parameter is similar between BS I, BS II and
BS III. Though BS II is the same as BS I but without the p function, we do observe small changes on
optimized geometry. For example, the P-Re-P bond angle increases from 147.38 with BS I to 149.55
with BS II, where BS I and BS III (both proper p-function used) are quite similar, 147.38 and 146.69
respectively. However, without the diffuse functions used on phosphorous and H atom such as 6311G and 6-31G, there is no clear trend in bond angle change from BS I to BS III. For example, with
6-311G case, P-Re-P bond angle increase 0.012 from BS I to BS II, while that bond angle decreases
0.008 from BS I to BS II in 6-31G case. This probably is due to the compensation of miss p-function
on metal Re through the diffuse function of phosphorous atoms.

3.2 Impact on Re-P and Re-H bond Length
However, the bond distance is less sensitive to the diffuse functions as long as the triple-zeta
basis set is used on H and P atoms. For example, when Re basis set changes from BS I to BS II, the
amount of Re-P bond length increases amongst the 6-311++G and 6-311G are both 0.031. The
amount of Re-P bond length increase from BS I to BS III is large for than those above, which is 0.066
 and 0.044  for 6-311++G and 6-311G, respectively. The same trend observed for Re-H bond
length changes from BS I to BS II, vs BS I to BS III with triple-zeta basis used on phosphorous and
hydrogen atoms. Of course, the amount of increase is relative small from BS I to BS II, such as 0.013
 for Re-Htop and 0.029 for Re-Hbase, for 6-311++G and 6-311G, respectively, and the calculated ReH bond distance are almost the same from BS I to BS III. Nevertheless, these discrepancies are
relatively small and the geometries are optimized similarly.

3.3 Impact on Agostic product
In order to investigate the impact of energy profile, as well as the weak interaction such as
agostic bonded H2 molecule on Re with these difference basis set, we searched another local minima,

Elechi et al.

where two set of hydrogen molecules agostic-bonded to Re atoms to form ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2
product (as shown in Figure 3). For the sake of comparison, only the BS II is used on metal Re, which
has no p-function. We find that there is little difference in the optimized geometries between 6311++G and 6-311G basis set for phosphorous and hydrogen atoms, as shown in the Figure 3. For
example, the P-Re-P bond angle is 153.232 for 6-311++G and 152.223 for 6-311G basis set, however,
this bond angle is 6 degree larger than the ReH7(PMe3)2 compound. The optimized Re-P bond lengths
are 2.3883  and 2.3877  for 6-311++G and 6-311G, respectively. The agostic bonded H2
understandably would have a longer Re-H2 distance (1.7184 and 1.7371) than Re-H (1.6517 ) in
ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2 product. The H-H bond length is slightly longer (0.9294 ) than that of free H2
molecule, which is optimized to be 0.742. Nevertheless, such small change between 6-311++G and
6-311G basis sets again suggests the little impact of missing p-function in optimized geometric
parameters. Since we optimized this agostic ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2 product under the same basis set on
Re and rest of elements as those in ReH7(PMe3)2 compound, it provides a unique opportunity to
investigate the impact on the calculated thermodynamic parameters such as total Energy (∆E), Zerocorrected Energy (∆EZPE), Enthalpy (∆H) and Gibbs free energy (∆G).

product ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2 under BS II basis set

Table 2 listed the calculated thermodynamic parameters of agostic ReH3 (PMe3)2 (H2)2
compound relative to ReH7 (PMe3)2. The basis set used for P and H atoms are 6-311++G and 6-311G,
and BS I and BS II for metal Re. As one can see that the calculated total Energy (∆E), Zero-corrected
Energy (∆EZPE), Enthalpy (∆H) and Gibbs free energy (∆G) are generally following the same pattern
between 6-311++G and G-311G basis set. For example, the relative energy calculated for BS II (aka:
BS I without p-function on metal, the second row 6-311++G /BS II ReH7 (PMe3)2) is in much higher
energy than those in BS I (the first row 6-311++G /BS I ReH7(PMe3)2). The same is true with the 6311G basis set. This clearly suggests that omitting the p-function on metal would not render the same
energy profile as those with the p-orbital on metal.

It is interesting to point out that the relative energy difference between the agostic
ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2 compound and ReH7(PMe3)2 compound is almost the same with 6-311++G/BS II
(the first bold row) as those with 6-311G/BSII basis set (the second bold row in Table 2). For
example, the calculated ∆G difference is 6.92 and 6.43 kcal/mol for 6-311++G and 6-311G,
respectively. This suggests that in the same basis set realm, the relative energy profile of any reaction
would still be valid. However, a direct comparison between the basis set with and without p-function
is not recommended.

4 Conclusions
In this study, the geometric and thermodynamic parameters of ReH7(PMe3)2 compound and the
agostic ReH3(PMe3)2(H2)2 compound are compared using Christiansen et. al. large and small basis
sets on metal Re and 6-31G, 6-311G, and 6-311++G basis sets on rest of element. Upon removing the
p-function on metal, we noticed the geometric changes from BS I to BS II are almost the same as long
as triple-zeta basis sets are used for rest of elements. The bond lengths calculated range from 0.013 to
0.031, and bond angles differs by less than 3 degrees. While the relative energy profile of a reaction
would be still reasonably resemble each other from BS I to BS II, we notice a big energy difference
(~25 kcal/mol) between the ReH7(PMe3)2 compound with p-function (BS I) and that without pfunction on metal (BS II). Therefore, a direct comparison between the basis set with and without pfunction is not recommended.
