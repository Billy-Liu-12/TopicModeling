Abstract
Link prediction is an important task in social network analysis, which also has applications in other
domains like, recommender systems, molecular biology and criminal investigations. The classical
methods of link prediction are based on graph topology structure and path features but few consider
clustering information. The cluster in graphs is densely connected group of vertices and sparsely
connected to other groups. Actually, the clustering results contain the essential information for link
prediction, and these vertices common neighbors may play different roles depending on if they belong
to the same cluster. Based on this assumption and characteristics of the common social networks, in
this paper, we propose a link prediction method based on clustering and global information. Our
experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that this method can improve link
prediction accuracy as the number of cluster grows.

1 Introduction and Background

R

Many real world systems can be naturally described as networks with nodes representing objects
and links denoting the relationships or interactions between them [1]. The study of complex networks
has therefore become a common focus of many branches of science. As part of the recent surge of
research on large, complex networks and their properties, social network analysis (SNA) has become
essential due to the proliferation of social networks. But social networks are highly dynamic objects;
they grow and change quickly over time through the addition of new edge and nodes. Consequently,
predicting a possible link in a network is an interesting and challenging issue that has recently
attracted more and more attentions. For example, it may be interesting to find a potential friendship
between two persons in a social network, or a potential collaboration between two scientists. This
problem is commonly known as the link prediction problem.

Link prediction is link mining [3], and the goal of link prediction is to estimate the likelihood of
the existence of links (existed yet unknown links, or future links) between nodes in social networks
[2,4]. The traditional data mining methods cannot resolve this problem because that the relationships
between objects are not considered in these methods. Therefore, the proposed method in this paper
will put forward a new similarity calculation method which will count in the newly measured relations
between individuals which is ignored in the previous SNA, and it is supposed to achieve the higher
accuracy rate in link prediction.
Besides their own respective disadvantages, most of the existing methods of link prediction do not
consider using clustering information, but the cluster in graphs is a densely connected group of
vertices sparsely connected to other groups, which is very important information for link prediction.
Hence, these vertices common neighbors may play different roles depending on if they belong to the
same cluster for prediction of a future link between a pair of vertices [11], Xu et al perform
experiments on synthetic and real world networks with various clusters and unveil the relation
between the network structure and the precision of link prediction methods: as the clustering structure
of the network grows, the accuracy of link prediction methods drastically improves [12]. Sucheta
soundarajan et al also show that the inclusion of clustering information improves the accuracy of
similarity-based link prediction methods [13], it is vital that the clustering information is applied to
improve the link prediction accuracy. In the other hand, link prediction is applicable to a wide variety
of application areas. For instance, in social networks, protein-protein interaction, information retrieval
and so on [14]. In this paper, we propose a link prediction method based on clustering and global
information. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks, we find that this method
outperform more original methods.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we review the related work in the
domain of link prediction. In section 3, we describe our proposed approach. In section 4, we present
the dataset, experiments and results on the synthetic and real-world networks. Finally, in section 5, we
provide the conclusion and the future work.

ET

In this section, we first introduce the relevant link prediction problem and several methods about
link prediction, and then we describe two useful evaluation metrics of link prediction which will be
employed in our method.
We can model a social network as a graph G= (V, E), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of
links. e= (u, v) E represents an interaction between nodes u and v. Each nonexistent link (u, v) UE where u, vV and U represents the universal set. Every algorithm of link prediction assigns a score
as Su, v to each nonexistent link to qualify its existence likelihood. This score can be viewed as a
measure of similarity between nodes u and v. higher score means higher probability that nodes u, v are
connected, and vice versa. All the nonexistent links are stored in decreasing order according to their
scores, and the links in the top are most likely to exist [2,12].
In experiments, to test the accuracy of an algorithm, the observed links, E, is randomly divided into
two parts: the training set, ETrain, is treated as known information, while the test set, ETest , is treated as
unknown information for prediction. Obviously, E = ETrain  ETest and ETrain  ETest =. We usually
apply two useful metrics to evaluate the prediction accuracy: AUC and Precision, and these two
standard metrics will be described at the end of this section.

2.1 Classic methods
The existing methods of link prediction are divided into three categories: The first method group is
based on local graph topology structure and path features, where different similarity measures need to

be defined. Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg summarize many similarity measures based on local graph
topology structure (node neighborhoods), together with the ensemble of all paths and higher-level
approaches [5].They compare these measures with random predictors in five co-authorship networks
and find that there is indeed useful information in the network topology to predict links in the
underlying networks alone. Liu and Lü propose a method based on local random walk, which has the
considerably good prediction results [5]. Furthermore, according to the resource allocation process in
networks, Zhou and Lü put forward a new similarity measure, which has great performance in six
different real world networks [6]. In the first group, the methods based on local information are more
efficient than those based on global information in the respect of their lower computational
complexity. However, due to the insufficient information, the methods based on local information may
be less effective for their lower prediction accuracy. The second method group is based on the
maximum likelihood estimation. These methods presuppose some organizing principles of the
network structures, with the detailed rules and specific parameters obtained by maximizing the
likelihood of the observed structure. Then the likelihood of any non-observed link can be calculated in
terms of those rules and parameters [7,8].The third method group mainly uses machine learning
techniques. O'Madadhain et al use primarily probabilistic classifiers to predict future co-participating
links in event-based network [9]. Hasan et al treat link prediction as a supervised learning task:
predicting whether it is a positive or negative example for two potentially connected nodes. The
features extracted from the co-authorship graph consist of proximity features, aggregated features and
topological features [10]. They compare the performance of link prediction for seven different
classification algorithms using different performance metrics [10]. The latter two groups methods are
only suitable for link prediction in small scale networks due to their higher computational complexity.
The above classic methods have the following disadvantages: first, these methods have low
accuracy of link prediction and are not suitable to link prediction for the large scale networks; second,
they have higher complexity and don't consider the cluster information. The conclusion that the
clustering results contain the essential information for link prediction has been proved in the related
references [11,12]. Considering the features of the real-world networks-Rich is getting richer and the
requirement of low complexity in SNA, we develop a new link prediction method based on clustering
and structural information. Our method is based on PA method [14,16,17], which has the lowest
complexity in the existing link predictions and satisfies the requirement of the common social
networks. Through our experiment, we prove that the cluster information can improve the accuracy of
link prediction. Our method not only can flexibly improve the prediction accuracy by adjusting a
parameter for the large scale networks, but also can achieve the higher prediction accuracy and low
complexity. The precise proof will be stated in the following section 3 and section 4.

2.2 Evaluation metrics

R

We introduce two standard metrics of link prediction accuracy: area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) and Precision. In principle, a link prediction algorithm provides an
ordered list of all non-observed links or equivalently gives each non-observed link a score to
quantify its existence likelihood [21].
AUC: It evaluates the algorithm's performance according to the whole list. The AUC value can be
interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing link is given a higher score than a
randomly chosen nonexistent link. That is, we randomly select a missing link and a nonexistent link to
compare their scores at each time, if among n independent comparisons, there are n' times the missing
link having a higher score and n'' times they have the same score [11,14], the AUC value is:

Precision: It focuses on the L links with the top ranks or the highest scores. If there are m
nonexistent links that are right to predict among top L nonexistent links [11,14], the Precision is
defined as:

In this section, according to characteristics of the common social networks and the practical
requirements of SNA, motivated by [11,12,13], we develop a link prediction method based on
clustering and structural information. Given G= (V, E) that indicates a social network, where V is the
set of nodes and E is the set of links. e=(x, y) E represents an interaction between nodes x and y.

Although we can't determine which nonexistent links are more likely to exist than other by the
above equations (1), (2) respectively, yet we can get an similarity score measure for disconnected
nodes pair(x, y) by the ratio of equation (1) to (2) to link prediction as follows:

To compute equation      , we must consider the number of common neighbors
with the same cluster label  , that is to say, the more the number of common neighbors in a same
cluster the more the likelihood of nodes x and y belonging to this cluster. So it is as follows:

If the clustering information of nodes in social networks is only used in link prediction, this is
insufficient to improve the performance of link prediction. To satisfy the need of link prediction for
social networks(i.e. simplicity and efficiency) and improve the accuracy of link prediction further, we
propose a new similarity measurement metric that combines the cluster information of nodes in
networks and the topology structure information based on the ''Rich are getting richer'' characteristics
of social networks. We establish the equation (9) as below.

In our algorithms, the basic operations consist of 1,3,5-7,and 8 in Algorithm 1. Hence, complexity
of our algorithms depends on these four basic operations. Considering that N denotes the number of
nodes in the original network G, we denote by M the number of links in the original network. K
denotes the number of nonexistent links in the original network. Complexity of operation 1 is O(M);
Complexity of operation 3 is O((M+N)*N); Complexity of operation 5-7 is O(N*N); Complexity of
operation 8 is O(K*M); In the overall, complexity of our algorithms is O((M+N)*N). For sparse
networks, complexity of our algorithms is O(N2), therefore, our algorithms are applicable for
analyzing the large scale networks.

R

In this section, we firstly perform experiments on five synthetic networks with various clustering,
in which we compare the classic link prediction methods with our method. Then we validate the
performance of our method on the representative real-world data sets.

4.1 Datasets

R

ET

The datasets considered in our experiments consist of two parts: (1) five synthetic networks that
we generate with various clustering by BA model [30]; These networks are denoted as BA(N,
m),where N is the size of the network, m is the number of links that a new node will connect when it is
added to the network; The detailed descriptions of these datasets are shown in Table 1, where N and M
denote the number of nodes and links respectively. <k> represents the average degree of the network.
C is the cluster coefficient of network, and Aver-PL is the average path length of network; dGCC
denotes the relative size of the giant connected component (i.e.GCC). (2) To validate our method, five
typical real-world social networks datasets from different domains are also applied in our experiments.
Karate is a social network of interactions between members of a karate club by Wayne Zachary [25];
UST is a network of the US air transportation system [26]; Jazz is a network of jazz bands in which a
link between two bands is established if they had at least one musician in common [27]; PB is a
directed network of US political blogs. Here we treat its links as undirected and self-connections are
omitted [28]; PG is a well-connected electrical power grid of western US, where nodes denote
generators, transformers and substations and links denote the transmission lines between them [29].
The detailed information about these networks is described in Table 2.

In our experiments, we randomly divide the links of the original network into the train set, ETrain,
and the test set, ETest, in order to test the prediction accuracy of our method. This has been introduced
in section 2. The train set contains 90% of links in E in the original network, and the remaining 10%
of links are in the test set ETest. Here, we apply the overall metric, AUC, to evaluate the prediction
accuracy results of our method (CLPA) on the five synthetic networks and five representative realworld networks compared with the classic prediction methods: CN [5,14], AA [18], RA [19], PA
[14,16,17], JC [15], LHN1 [20,26], HDI [14], HPI [7,14], Katz [14]. Table 3 shows the prediction
results on five synthetic networks, where θ = 0.4 in CLPA and β = 0.0005 in Katz. Table 4 shows the
prediction results on five real-world networks, where θ = 0.9 in CLPA and β = 0.0005 in Katz.

From the results of Table 3 and Figure 2, we can find CLPA has the best prediction performance
on these five synthetic networks compared with the above other methods. When the cluster coefficient
of the network grows, the total performance of these prediction methods improves. Apart from CLPA,
CN, AA, RA and PA have better results in Table 3. However, a natural question is that whether similar
phenomenon can be found in real-world networks. Therefore, we validate those findings on five
representative real-world networks.
In Table 4 and Figure 3, we find CLPA has the best performance on other networks except from
Jazz. There is better prediction performance of these methods with the growth of cluster coefficient in
networks. Those findings in Table 4 are consistent with the above simulation experiment in Table 3.

Figure 3 illustrates these findings more clearly. Our method is more suitable for analyzing the scale
free networks. Other networks satisfy the power law distribution while Jazz satisfies the Poisson
distribution in Table 4, and this may be the reason that our method can't obtain the best result in Jazz.
Although CLPA has not the best result in Jazz, yet its accuracy is better than PA. In the overall, our
method outperform the above classic prediction methods, and at the same time this results that the
clustering information of networks is very important for link prediction in social networks.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

A

We aim to achieve both the justifiability and high accuracy in link prediction. In order to reach this
goal, we have presented a simple yet effective approach of link prediction in social networks.
Specifically, we use the clustering information of the networks based on the topological structure
method and characteristics of most social networks and the experiments on ten classical datasets show
that our method has better performance of link prediction than other methods in the typical networks
like social networks, and the clustering information can improve the accuracy of link prediction.
In the future work, on the one hand, we will examine and test more datasets from other domains,
where more networks do not satisfy the power law distribution. On the other hand, we will combine
the content/semantic information of individual nodes with our method to achieve higher accuracy in
link prediction. In addition, we will apply our method in recommendation systems to make the
recommendations more effective and understandable.
