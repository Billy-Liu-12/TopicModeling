Abstract
The second order Ordinary Diﬀerential Equation (ODE) system obtained after semidiscretizing
the wave-type partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) with the ﬁnite element method (FEM) shows
strong numerical stiﬀness. Its resolution requires the use of numerical methods with good
stability properties and controlled numerical dissipation in the high-frequency range. The
HHT-α and BDF-α methods are second order precision, unconditionally stable and able to
dissipate high-modes for some values of the parameters. The ﬁnite element method has been
applied to the one-dimensional linear wave-type PDE and to a non-linear version of a string
of a guitar. The ODE systems obtained after applying FEM are solved by these two methods,
proving that both are able to dissipate the high-modes.
Keywords: Wave-type PDE, numerical dissipation, high-frequency modes, linear multistep methods

Introduction

We will consider the one-dimensional (1D) wave equation given in terms of Partial Diﬀerential
Equations (PDEs). A string of length L will be considered, where its two ends held ﬁxed at
height zero. Assume that its initial position and speed are given, f (x) and g(x) respectively.
Let u(x, t) denote the vertical displacement of the string from the x axis in time t. The string is
undergoing small amplitude transverse vibrations so that u(x, t) obeys the wave equation. The
1D linear wave equation with boundary conditions (BC) and initial conditions (IC) is given by:
⎧
⎪
0 < x < L, t > 0
utt = α2 uxx ,
⎨
(1)
BC : u(0, t) = 0 = u(L, t),
t>0
⎪
⎩
IC : u(x, 0) = f (x), ut (x, 0) = g(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L
where α = Tρ is the speed propagation of the wave, T is the applied tension in the string and
ρ the linear mass density.

We will ﬁnd the approximate solutions of equation (1) numerically using the Finite Element
Method (FEM), in which the process of ﬁnding the solution u(x, t) consists of discretizing the
domain L in elements and nodes. The solution approach is based on the elimination of the
spatial derivatives of the PDE and this leads to a system of second order Ordinary Diﬀerential
Equations (ODEs).
The ODE system that results after the FEM discretization presents high stiﬀness. Stiﬀness
is a delicate and important concept when solving ODEs. Various authors [11, 13] say that
there is no rigorous deﬁnition of stiﬀness. It depends on the ODE, on its initial conditions,
on the numerical method used for its resolution and on the time interval in which the ODE is
solved. In this article we will use the deﬁnition of stiﬀness given in [12], which says that stiﬀness
occurs when diﬀerent magnitude eigenvalues exist in the solution, where this diﬀerence in the
magnitude could happen in the real part or in the imaginary part of the eigenvalues.
The high-modes of the ODE system are result of the FEM approximation and they are
not representative, so they have to be removed from the solution to avoid inconvenient noise.
Solving stiﬀ ODEs requires the use of numerical methods with good stability properties and
controlled numerical dissipation in the high-frequency range. The HHT-α and BDF-α methods
are second order precision, unconditionally stable and able to dissipate high-modes for some
values of the parameters. The HHT-α operates directly in second order ODEs and the BDF-α
is for ﬁrst order ODEs. We will see that both methods give noise free and accurate solutions.
The article is organized as follows: in Section (2) the formulation of the Finite Element
Method is given which enables us to obtain an ODE system from a PDE; in Sections (3) and
(4) both methods are presented; in Section (5) some numerical results are reported and ﬁnally
in Section (6) some conclusions are given.

The Finite Element Method

The Finite Element Method approximates solutions in a ﬁnite dimensional space. Having chosen
a ﬁnite basis of functions, the PDE solution is written as linear combination of the functions of
the basis, and the coeﬃcients are obtained via the orthogonality condition of the residual of the
PDE with the vectorial subspace spanned by the basis. Integration by parts reduces the order
of the derivatives and leads to the system of equations that approximates the weak formulation
of the PDE.

2.1

Application of the FEM Method to the Wave Equation

We will show the application of the Finite Element Method to the wave-type PDE (1). A step
size h > 0 of the spatial mesh will be considered, being h = L/(n + 1) where n ∈ N. In this
way the partition deﬁned by the nodes:
xj = jh, j = 0, 1, ..., (n + 1)

(2)

breaks up the spatial interval [0, L] in (n+1) subintervals of length h: Ij = [xj , xj+1 ], j = 0, ..., n.
Observe that the ﬁrst and the last nodes correspond to the end of the interval [0, L]: x0 = 0,
xn+1 = L.
Each internal node xj , j = 1, ..., n, is associated with a piecewise continuous and linear
basis function Nj (x), that veriﬁes Nj (xi ) = δji for j = 1, ..., n and i = 0, ..., (n + 1), being δ
the Kronecker delta. Next, we introduce the vectorial subspace of dimension n formed by the
functions {Nj }j=1,...,n : Vh = span {Nj : j = 1, ..., n}.

Approximate solutions of the wave PDE (1) in the subspace C([0, ∞), Vh ) are found so that:
n

u(x, t) ≈ uh (x, t) =

dj (t)Nj (x)

(3)

j=1

Observe that function (3) depends on the spatial variable x as well as on the temporary
variable t. The function (3) will be univocally deﬁned if its coeﬃcients dj (t) are deﬁned precisely.
It has to be taken into account that because of the election of the basis functions {Nj }j=1,...,n ,
dj (t) is the value of the function uh (x, t) in the point x = xj .
The weak formulation to calculate the approximate solution uh is given by [10]:
Find uh ∈ C 2 ([0, ∞) ; Vh ) that veriﬁes:
L
0

L

uh,tt (x, t)wh (x)dx = −

0

α2 uh,x (x, t)wh (x)dx, t > 0, ∀wh ∈ Vh

(4)

together with the initial conditions:
uh (x, 0) = fh (x), uh,t (x, 0) = gh (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ L

(5)

where fh and gh are interpolations of the initial conditions (f, g) in Vh .
By substituting the expression (3) of uh (x, t) and its derivative uh,tt (x, t) in (4), and applying
this equality for all the functions Ni of the basis, the following system of n second order Ordinary
Diﬀerential Equations is obtained:

HHT-α Method

The HHT-α method is based on the Newmark method [14]. The Newmark method is useful to
solve ODEs of order 2:
y = f (t, y, y ), y(t0 ) = η, y (t0 ) = ηˆ
(9)
781

Solving the Wave-Type PDE by Numerical Damping Control Methods

Alberdi and Anza

where T = [t0 , tn ] is a ﬁnite interval and y : [t0 , tn ] → Rm and f : [t0 , tn ] × Rm → Rm are
continuous functions.
In computational mechanics, the second order linear ODE takes the form:
ma + cv + kd = f (t)

(10)

which corresponds to a mass-spring-damper system, where m is the mass, k the spring constant,
c the damping coeﬃcient, d the displacement, v = d the velocity and a = d the acceleration.
The biparametric family of the Newmark method [14] is given by:
⎧
⎪
⎨man+1 + cvn+1 + kdn+12 = fn+1
(11)
dn+1 = dn + Δtvn + Δt2 [(1 − 2β) an + 2βan+1 ]
⎪
⎩
vn+1 = vn + Δt [(1 − γ) an + γan+1 ]
where β and γ are free parameters which govern the accuracy, stability and numerical dissipation
of Newmark’s algorithm.
When solving second order ODEs that come from the FEM semidiscretization of the wavetype PDE, the higher modes of these equations are artifacts of the discretization process and
they are not representative of the behaviour of the governing PDE. So it is convenient to
use methods with algorithmic damping that remove the participation of high-frecuency modal
components.
The stability and the numerical damping of the method are studied by applying the method
to the second order test equation d + ω 2 d = 0, which represents an undamped vibrating
physical system with natural frequency f = ω/(2π) where w = k/m. In this case, (11) can
be written in this recursive way:
Xn+1 = AXn
(12)
T

where: Xn+i = dn+i , hvn+i , h2 an+i for i = 0, 1; h = Δt and A is the ampliﬁcation matrix.
Eigenvalues of matrix A are calculated and the largest one in module is the spectral radius:
ρ(A) = max {|λi | : λi eigenvalue of A}

(13)

The spectral radius is closely connected to the stability of the method and ρ(A) ≤ 1 is
required to prevent ampliﬁcation of An as n becomes large. The method is unstable when
γ < 12 and it is unconditionally stable when 12 ≤ γ ≤ 2β. High frequency dissipation is achieved
when:
2
γ + 12
(14)
β=
4
On the other hand, if we want to study how the values of the spectral radius depend on
ˆ has to be evaluated for diﬀerent values of h
ˆ = ωh. Following this condition,
frequency, ρ(A(h))
the dependence of the spectral radius on ωh/(2π) = h/T can be obtained for Newmark’s method
and others as it is shown in Figure 1.
The system (12) can be reduced to a diﬀerence equation in the displacements, which takes
the form of a linear multistep method for second order diﬀerential equations:
2
i=0

αi dn+i = h2

2

βi dn+i

(15)

i=0

The order of the method can be calculated by applying the order conditions for linear
multistep methods of the type (15) [12]. The method results are second-order accurate when
γ = 1/2, [10, 14].
782

Solving the Wave-Type PDE by Numerical Damping Control Methods

Alberdi and Anza

In the second-order accurate Newmark method (γ = 1/2), β ≥ 1/4 retains unconditional
stability. If in addition, high frequency dissipation is requiered, β = 1/4 has to be veriﬁed.
In this case, Newmark’s method becomes the trapezoidal method, and although it veriﬁes the
high frequency dissipation condition (14), high modes are not damped as ρ∞ = 1, see Figure
1. So, second-order accurate condition does not allow numerical dissipation.
The HHT-α method is a modiﬁcation made to the Newmark method, with the aim of
obtaining numerical dissipation in the high frequencies while retaining the order and stability
conditions. This method was proposed by Hilber-Hughes-Taylor [9] and it is also known as
HHT or the α-method. The method consists of maintaining the two last expressions of the
Newmark method (11) and modifying the expression of the time-discrete equation of motion
with a new parameter α as follows:
man+1 + cvn+1+α + kdn+1+α = f (tn+1+α )
where:

⎧
⎪
⎨dn+1+α = (1 + α) dn+1 − αdn
vn+1+α = (1 + α) vn+1 − αvn
⎪
⎩
tn+1+α = (1 + α) tn+1 − αtn

(16)

(17)

In the case that α = 0, the HHT-α method is reduced to Newmark’s method.
1
The method is second-order accurate when γ = 1−2α
2 . In addition, if α ∈ − 3 , 0 and
2

β = (1−α)
the HHT-α method is a two-order method, unconditionally stable and high frecuency
4
dissipation can be obtained.
In Figure 1 we can see the spectral radii of Newmark and HHT-α methods together with the
spectral radii of other typical methods used in computational mechanics, such us, Houbolt’s
method, Collocation method (among them the Wilson method [16] which is a concrete case
of the Collocation method) and Park’s method [5, 8, 10]. In this ﬁgure we can see that the
spectral radii of Houbolt’s and Park’s method tend to zero as Δt/T → ∞ which is typical
in backward-diﬀerences schemes. It can also be seen, how the unconditionally stable HHT-α
method when α ∈ − 13 , 0 , dampens the high modes more strongly as the value of α decreases.

4

BDF-α Method

The BDF-α method is based on the Backward Diﬀerentiation Formulae (BDF) of order 2 [1].
The BDFs are linear multistep methods useful to solve ODEs of order 1:
y (t) = f (t, y(t)) ,

y (t0 ) = y0

(18)

where T = [t0 , tn ] is a ﬁnite interval and y : [t0 , tn ] → Rm and f : [t0 , tn ] × Rm → Rm are
continuous functions.
Since they were introduced [4], the BDFs have been widely used due to their good stability
properties for solving stiﬀ problems [2, 4, 7]. The BDF of order k can be expressed as follows:
k

αj yn+j = hfn+k

(19)

j=0

which responds to the general form of linear multistep methods for ﬁrst order ODEs [6, 15].

(20)

Based on the BDF2, the BDF-α is also a second order accurate linear multistep method. It
is unconditionally stable for α ≥ −0.5 and it is given by the next expression:

(21)

The BDF-α = 0 is the BDF2 method and the BDF-α = −0.5 is the trapezoidal rule.
The ampliﬁcation factor of the linear multistep methods for ﬁrst order ODEs can be studied
by applying the method to the test equation y = λy and rewriting the result using the form:
Xn+k = AXn+k−1

(22)

where Xn+k = (yn+1 , yn+2 , ..., yn+k )t , Xn+k−1 = (yn , yn+1 , ..., yn+k−1 )t and A is the ampliﬁcation factor which is a square matrix of dimension k ×k. When working with second order ODEs,
their test equation d + ω 2 d = 0 is considered. Transforming this equation in its equivalent
system of two ﬁrst order ODEs we get:

(23)

System (23) can be uncoupled in two independent equations of the form:
y = ±iωy

(24)

and the application of the general theory, (13) and (22), to the second order problem d +ω 2 d = 0
is equivalent to apply this theory to the ﬁrst order test equation y = λy, but taking into account

that λ = iω. Again, the values of the spectral radius depending on frequency are obtained by
ˆ for diﬀerent values of h
ˆ = iωh, taking into account that for this speciﬁc case
evaluating ρ(A(h))
λ = iω. In this way, the dependence of the spectral radius on ωh/(2π) = h/T can be obtained
for BDF-α methods and others, Figure 2.
We see that the trapezoidal method does not show numerical damping, that is to say ρ = 1.
The BDF2 (BDF-α = 0) has a spectral radius that decreases as frequency increases. Even
though the minimum value that the BDF2 shows for ρ∞ = limh/T →∞ ρ(A) is the most eﬀective
in removing the participation of high-frecuency modal components, it is more convenient to
have an algorithm which permits a parametric control of numerical dissipation, allowing the
participation of the medium frequencies. Figure 2 shows how the parametric control of the HHTα = −0.3 and the BDF-α = −0.35 methods decrease the medium range frequency numerical
damping while maintaining a low spectral radius in the high range, which is enough to dissipate
quickly this frequency components.

Numerical Results
Linear Wave-Type PDE

Using the methodology described we experiment the algorithmic damping control of the HHTα = −0.3 and BDF-α = −0.35 methods. The 1D linear wave equation (1) is considered taking
as the initial condition a rectangular pulse and being L = 8 cm and α2 = 1 cm2 /s2 . A
discretization of 400 elements is taken and a time interval of 16 seconds. We have represented
the position of the nodes with the initial condition (time instant t = 0) and the solution in
the time instant t = 2. The solution obtained by the trapezoidal method shows eﬀects of
noise as small ringlets, see Figure 3. But the solutions obtained by the HHT-α = −0.3 and
BDF-α = −0.35 methods are nearly noise free, Figures 4 and 5.

cal methods with good stability properties and controlled numerical dissipation in the highfrequency range. It is known that the HHT-α = −0.3 method, which is second order accurate
and unconditionally stable, allows the numerical damping of the undesirable high frequency
modes associated to the FEM semidiscretization. The BDF-α = −0.35 method, based on the
BDF, is also second order accurate and unconditionally stable and it is able to dissipate the
high frequency modes. A linear wave-type PDE and a non-linear version of a string of a guitar
have been solved using these two methods, obtaining noise-free and accurate solutions.
