Abstract
In this paper, we focus on finding the suitable value of the time threshold, which is then used in the
method of user session identification based on the time. To determine its value, we used the Length
variable representing the time a user spent on a particular site. We compared two values of time
threshold with experimental methods of user session identification based on the structure of the web:
Reference Length and H-ref. When comparing the usefulness of extracted rules using all four methods,
we proved that the use of the time threshold calculated from the quartile range is the most appropriate
method for identifying sessions for web usage mining.

1 Introduction
Web servers offer a valuable source of information through the hosted websites. Web servers also
keep information about visitors. This information can be later used for the analysis of visitor
behaviour. While the primary web data are used to get knowledge from the web structure or its
content, the secondary ones are used in the WUM. The source of secondary data can be a web server
access or error log file, proxy server log file, web browser log, browser cookies etc. A web server log
is in its default form known as Common Log File and keeps information about IP address; date and
time of visit; accessed and referenced resource. If we use the extended version of the log file, we can
collect more information, e.g. type of browser (User-Agent Field). In the first phase, web log data are
pre-processed in order to identify users, sessions, page views, and clickstreams. Pre-processing refers

to the stage of processing the web server logs to identify meaningful representations. Data cleaning
methods are necessary because web usage mining is sensitive to noise. On the other hand, data preprocessing can be a difficult task when the available data is incomplete or includes erroneous
information. According to Cooley et al. (Cooley, Mobasher, Srivastava, & others, 1999) it consists of
1. data cleaning (for removing irrelevant references and fields, removing erroneous references,
adding missing references due to caching mechanisms, etc.),
2. data integration (for synchronizing data from multiple server logs, integrating registration data,
etc.)(Bayir, Toroslu, & Cosar, 2006),
3. data transformation (for user-session identification (Chen, Fu, & Tong, 2003), path completion (Li,
Feng, & Mao, 2008; C. Zhang & Zhuang, 2008),
4. data reduction (for reducing dimensionality) (Nasraoui & Saka, 2007).
Pattern discovery of web usage mining which is the outcome of the proposed methodology is
discussed in detail in (Klocoková, 2011; Koprda, Balogh, & Turčáni, 2011; Nina, Rahman, Bhuiyan,
& Ahmed, 2009; Song, Luo, Chen, & Gao, 2007; Tan, Chen, & Yang, 2010; Turcinek, Stastny, &
Motycka, 2012). In general, discovering association and sequence rules, segmentation (cluster
analysis, methods based on analogy, etc.), and classification (decision rules, decision trees, Bayes
classification, etc.) are the most applied methods in the web usage mining. On the contrary, a
prediction (multinomial logit model, neural networks, support vector regression, etc.) is less common
in the web usage mining (Munk & Drlík, 2014; Olej & Filipova, 2012; Olej & Filipová, 2011).
In this paper, we focus on user session identification that is the third step of data pre-processing as
stated above. The easiest way to identify the session is to split visits based on the visitor IP address,
but then the problem of the unique IP address raise. If the user’s network use the NAT (or proxy)
technology, which is actually common in most networks, more than one user is hidden under one
public address. Another problem the identification of unique visit raises when the user use more than
one computer (multiple IP addresses) at the same time, or she uses more browsers at the same
computer.
The most commonly used technique for user session identification is the time threshold (Berendt &
Spiliopoulou, 2000). If we find two consecutive records with a time difference higher than the selected
time threshold, we will split the session. This method is simple to implement with multiple threshold
values, so it is very popular.
We can get another view for the session identification if we take into account the website structure.
In the log file, we have accessed and referenced pages, so we can use heuristic methods for session
identification. The H-ref method (Spiliopoulou, Mobasher, Berendt, & Nakagawa, 2003) beside the
referrer field use also the website map. If we use the heuristic identification and find two consecutive
records with the same IP field, which are not directly connected with hyperlink, we can say that we
find access of two unique visitors sharing same IP address. The h-ref method combines this procedure
with the time threshold.
Another not so commonly used method of session identification is the Reference Length (Cooley,
Mobasher, & Srivastava, 1997; Cooley et al., 1999; Kapusta, Munk, & Drlik, 2012; Kapusta, Munk, &
Drlík, 2012) method based on the web site searching model. That model and the model of user
behaviour are fundamental to the correct aggregation of individual user’s clicks to meaningful sessions
that are sometimes referred to as transactions. We can organize individual web pages of the examined
web site to three groups in term of the model: content pages, navigation (auxiliary) pages, multiple
purpose pages.
The content pages can be defined as the web pages where we can find the required information.
These pages are the reason of the user visit throughout his browsing of web space. Therefore, we can
say that, in the case of association rules searching, content pages are the most important. Our objective
is to discover useful rules among those pages. We can define the user session as the set of the auxiliary

1780

references up to and including each content reference for a given user (Auxiliary – Content
Transactions). Mining auxiliary-content transactions would essentially give the common traversal
paths through the web site to a given content page. The process of web browsing can be summarized
as visiting many navigation pages a finish on the content page. If the user land on the content page, the
sessions will end. Forthcoming browsing or searching for another content page we define as the next
session. The path to the content page through navigation pages as referenced as the transaction in the
literature.

1.1 The aim of the experiment
As part of the research at the Department of Computer Science of Constantine the Philosopher
University in Nitra, we conducted several experiments in which we evaluated the relevance of the
various data preparation steps of web server log file for sequence analysis. We investigated which
steps of data preparation for proper analysis of the website with anonymous access are important. The
motivation for our current research were the following facts:
•

Experiments we conducted in the past showed that the user session identification had a significant
impact to results of WUM sequence analysis are significant impact.

•

The most used method of user session identification is the STT method, as the literature review
shows.

•

Previous experiments we realized showed that the recommended STT values (10, 15 and 30
minutes) are not “ideal”. The STT value can be set dynamically as presented in (Huynh & Miller,
2009; Štencl & Štastný, 2009; J. Zhang & Ghorbani, 2004).

•

There are few more experimental methods of user session identification, e.g. Reference Length
method and H-ref method which both were not compared with “traditional” session identification
methods yet.

We propose an experiment for user session identification with the aim to compare the STT method
with the unambiguous cookie method. We also want to verify the suitability of other session
identification methods as well as the appropriateness of two new STT calculation methods.

1.2 Related work
In this section, we describe already realized experiments where the experimental methods based on
heuristics (web structure based heuristics, web page time spent heuristic) were used. To detect limits
of the user session we can use time thresholds (Gayo-Avello, 2009). This method is popular as it is
simple to implement, and it often used with various values of STT. Most common values of STT are 5
minutes (Downey, Dumais, & Horvitz, 2007), 10 minutes (Huang, Chien, & Oyang, 2003; Chien &
Immorlica, 2005), 15 minutes (He & Harper, 2000) and 30 minutes (Radlinski & Joachims, 2005).
Most commonly used values of STT were also the aim of research of data preprocessing from the
virtual learning environment log file (Drlik & Skalka, 2011; Munk & Drlik, 2011). Author compared
the results when the 15, 30 and 60 minutes STT where used in combination with/without path
completion. Results showed the application of lower values of STT (15 and 30 minutes) to session
identification has impact to lowering the amount of trivial and inexplicable rules.
We can also mention “non-standard” STT value of 25.5 minutes used in (Catledge & Pitkow,
1995). Authors use this value as the sum of the average time the user spent on the website and 150%
of standard deviation of the time the user spent on the website. Based on these experiments, the STT
value of 30 minutes becomes most common (Chakrabarti et al., 1999) even it not always most
appropriate. Huynh and Miller realized experiments with dynamic STT based on the type of web
service (Huynh & Miller, 2009). Zhang a Ghorbani (J. Zhang & Ghorbani, 2004) compared 10

1781

minutes STT, 30 minutes STT and dynamic STT. The value of dynamic STT was based on the time a
visitor spent on a page (the Length variable and its standard deviation). They experimented with
various characteristics of the Length, and they excluded the zero spent time (web crawlers) and highest
spent time. They compared overall 11 time oriented methods for the session identification.
The heuristic method H-ref used Seco and Cardoso (Seco & Cardoso, 2006). The record from the
log file was marked as a new session in case of missing referral in previous sessions or if the time
interval between to consecutive record is more than 60 minutes. We also use this value in proposed
experiment.

2 Research methodology
When examining the impact of data pre-processing steps for the quality and quantity of the
knowledge we proceed as follows:
1. Data acquisition – defining the observed variables into the log file from the point of view of
obtaining the necessary data (IP address, date and time of access, URL address, etc.).
2. Creation of data matrix from the log file (access data) and sitemap (content data).
3. Data preparation.
4. Data analysis – discovering user behavioural patterns. For the extraction of sequence rules we use
the Apriori algorithm implementation (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami, 1993).
5. Understanding data after the analysis.
We create data file based on the output of the analysis and calculate basic characteristics of
examined files: accesses count, number of identified sequences, number of frequent sequences,
average length of identified sessions.
6. The comparison of knowledge we acquired from examined files (pre-processed with different level
of data preparation)
When evaluating the acquired knowledge, we focus not only on the quantity of extracted rules, but
also on their quality. Quality sequence rules is assessed by two indicators (Berry & Linoff, 2004;
Stankovicova, 2009): support and confidence.
We evaluate the acquired knowledge in terms of quantity and quality of founded sequence rules in
the mean of:
a. Comparison of the portion of founded rules.
b. Comparison of the support and confidence of founded rules.

2.1 Data description
The source of data for our experiment is web server log file of domestic significant commercial
bank operating in Slovakia gathered from selected sub content according the to valid EU Directives
and National Bank of Slovakia Decrees) for 4 years (2009 – 2012). The data set compromise a/ Pillar
3 Disclosure Requirements Quarterly and Semi-annually, b/ Pillar 3 related information, c/ Other
information. Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements consists of information on the Bank (e.g. organizational
chart, number of employees, list of the bank activities (e.g. in respect to diversity management
(Egerová, Jiřincová, Lančarič, & Savov, 2013)) etc.); financial information (financial statement
information, information on asset quality, information on liquidity etc.); information on risk
management (risk strategies, policies, credit risk management, on risk weighted assets according to
risk measurement approaches etc.), information on securitisation etc. Pillar 3 related information are
those which are contained in the bank annual reports, minutes from general assembly meetings,
prospect of emitent, information about group and information for banks. Part Other information
contains such information as the bank history, awards, mission-vision-values, anti money laundering,
ethical codes, contacts, etc.

2.2 Data preparation
A web server log file was pre-processed in the standard way. When we excluded worthless data
(requests for images, style sheets, etc.) and web crawlers’ accesses, we have got 938497 records from
the year 2010. Before we can apply session identification methods, we have to get the time a user
spent on a particular website. If the time interval between two consequent records in the log file is
more than 60 minutes, the consecutive record represents a new session. It is unlikely that some user
read the page more than 60 minutes. The value of σ is set to 60.
User sessions were identified in following data preparation levels:
• (File REF-L1): session identification based on the Reference Length without path completion,
• (File REF-L2): session identification based on the Reference Length with path completion,
• (File STT-M1): session identification based on the STT size equal to average duration from all
sessions without path completion,
• (File STT-M2): session identification based on the STT size equal to average duration from all
sessions with path completion,
• (File STT-Q1): session identification based on the STT size equal to quartile from all sessions
without path completion,
• (File STT-Q2): session identification based on the STT size equal to quartile from all sessions with
path completion,
• (File H-REF1): session identification based on the H-ref method without path completion,
• (File H-REF2): session identification based on the H-ref method with path completion.

2.3 Algorithms used in the data preparation
In the next section, we describe results important for application of the session identification
methods as well as individual algorithms for the session identification.
Reference Length
The Reference Length heuristic is based on the assumption that the time spent on site (Length) is
related to whether the site is classified as content or navigation. Assuming that the variable Length has
an exponential distribution, and we know the portion of navigation pages, we can use the quantile
function to estimate the border time. In our case, the use of heuristics is desirable due to the fact that
we are able to classify the page as navigation or content one. We are able to determine the portion of
the navigation pages. Due the nature of the bank website we do not need to bother with mixed pages.
The bank portal consists from 364 pages including pdf and doc files. Document files are classified
as content pages (273 pages). Other pages are classified as navigation ones (91 pages) in case that the
page contains at least one hyperlink excluding the main menu. If the page in not classified as the
navigation page we can say, it is content one.
Based on the frequency of navigation and content pages, the proportion of navigation pages is p =
0.25. We can use the Reference Length method only if the Length variable representing the time spent
on a particular page is exponential distributed.
The zero hypothesis; the Length variable fit the supposed distribution; is rejected at the 1%
significance level based on the results of Chi-Square test (Chi-Square test = 3502953.27155, df = 22
(adjusted), p = 0.00000). The Length variable almost fit the supposed distribution, but there are some
deviations from the exponential distribution.

1783

Determining the time window threshold ...

J. Kapusta, M. Munk, P. Svec and A. Pilkova

If we made the assumption about the portion of the navigation pages in the log file, we would
determine the threshold time C, which separates the content pages from the navigation ones. The value
of the threshold time divide the navigation pages and content pages according the time a user spent on
a particular page. The next session starts with the page, where    The first k-1 pages
are classified as navigation pages and the last page (k) is classified as the content one. The time spent
on the last page is higher than the threshold time.
Estimation of session threshold time
If the Length variable represents the time a user spent on the page, we can estimate another value
of the threshold time. We inspired with methods of the non-outlier range of the Length variable. We
suppose that values higher than QIII + 1.5Q represent the end of the session.

Table 1: Descriptive characteristics of the Length variable

Firstly we estimate the value of STT based on the average value of the Length, which is 112
seconds (Table 1). Files with identified sessions are called STT-M1 and STT-M2. The Length values
higher than 126 seconds we consider as non-outliers and files with identified session are called STTQ1 and STT-Q2.
H-ref algorithm
The H-ref method does not consider the time a user spent on a particular page, even there still exist
the 60 minutes STT to maintain extreme cases. The algorithm uses the referrer field from the web
server log file. We implemented this algorithm using the php+mysql in our experiment and got files
with identified sessions H-REF1 and H-REF2.

3 Experiment Results
The most identified sessions were in REF-L files. In comparison to the lowest number of
identified sequences in H-REF files, it is increased by 45 %. The lowest discrepancy in the number of
identifies sessions was between the files STT-M and STT-Q. It is obvious that the minimum
discrepancy in the number of sequences (6741) is caused by the lowest difference in STT (Session
Timeout Threshold) between files STT-M and STT-Q. The number of frequented sessions has almost
increased by 150 % between the lowest number of frequented sequences in file REF-L1 and the
highest number of sequences in file H-REF2.

The number of records has naturally increased after paths completion. The H-REF method has
recorded the highest increase i.e. the discrepancy between H-REF1 and H-REF2 is 67106 records,
what represents the increase more than 7 %. The lowest increase was by using REF-L method where
the discrepancy between REF-L1 and REF-L2 is 28620 records, what represents increase by 3 %.
Based on the initial results we articulated the following assumptions:
•

We expect that the identification of the session using H-REF method will have a significant impact
on quantity of extracted rules.

•

Since H-REF method works with web map and principally tries to create the meaningful sessions,
we expect that, in case of using H-REF method, the path completion will not have a significant
impact on quality of extracted rules in terms of their basic characteristics of quality.

•

We expect that the path completion using all examined methods will have a significant impact on
the quantity of extracted rules.

3.1 Comparison of proportion of the rules found in examined files
The results of the analysis of the proportion of the fund rules are sequence rules. They were
obtained from the frequented sequences fulfilling the minimum support (see the summary in Table 3).
Similar as in the previous experiment, we set up the value on min s = 0.005. Frequent sequences were
obtained from identified sessions, i.e. from the individual users’ portal visits during the examined year
2010 .

Table 3: Summary of the extracted sequence rules in individual files

The most rules were extracted from the files H-REF in case of path completion as well as without
path completion. In comparison to the lowest number of rules in file REF-L, it is an increase by 162
rules, which represents 385 % of extracted rules. Through that, the more rules were extracted in
examined files after path completion (REF-L2, STT-M2, STT-Q2, H-REF2) than without path
completion (REF-L1, STT-M1, STT-Q1, H-REF1) this increase was not significant. It is increasing of
number of rules from 7 % (STT-M1 vs. STT-M2) to 20 % (H-REF1 vs. H-REF2). The highest
increase of the rules after path completion was surprising for us. The principle of the method consists
of the meaningful sessions searching based on the web map. For this reason, we did not expect the
large increase of the number of extracted rules after path completion. Therefore, it will be interesting
to compare it in terms of quality of extracted rules.
Results of sequence analysis show the high concordance of proportion of extracted rules between
files STT-M and STT-Q after path completion as well as without path completion. This concordance
is natural, since it is an application of STT with similar sizes.
Based on the results of Q test (Table 3), the zero hypothesis, which reasons that the occurrence of
the extracted rules does not depend on individual levels of data preparation for WUM, is rejected at
the 1 % significance level. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance represents the degree of concordance
in the number of extracted rules in individual files. The value of the coefficient is 0.46, where 1 means
a perfect concordance and 0 represent discordance. Low value of the coefficient confirms Q test result.

Table 4: Homogenous groups in examined files

From the multiple comparison (Tukey HSD test) four homogenous groups (Table 4) were
identified. The largest group consists of files STT-M1, STT-M2, STT-Q1 and STT-Q2. Path
completion has no significant impact on the quantity of extracted sequence rules in terms of
identification of session using STT methods. Statistically significant differences were proved between
STT methods and others.
Next identified group, in terms of the average occurrence of extracted rules, consists of files where
the sessions were identified using Reference Length with/without application of path completion.
Statistically significant differences at the 5 % significance level were proved between group of files
with application of H-REF method and others and also between the files with application of H-REF
method with path completion (H-REF2) and without path completion (H-REF1).
Path completion has a significant impact on the quantity of extracted rules in case of the use of HREF method. Likewise, the application of H-REF method has a significant impact on the quantity of
extracted rules.

3.2 Comparison of quality of the rules found in examined files
In the previous section, we identified homogeneous groups in terms of average occurrence of
extracted rules. i.e. in terms of quantity of extracted rules. More comprehensive view is obtained from
the comparison of quality of sequence rules assessed by indicators- support and confidence. There are
differences in results of sequence rule analysis among individual files in terms of values of support
and confidence of extracted rules.

Kendall’s coefficient of concordance represents the degree of concordance in support of extracted
rules among the examined files (Table 5). The value of the coefficient (Table 5) is 0.88, where 1
means a perfect concordance and 0 represent discordance.
From the multiple comparison (Tukey HSD test), three homogenous groups (Table 6) were
identified in both cases. Statistically significant differences at the 5 % significance level in support and
confidence of extracted rules were proved among files with identification of sessions using STT
methods (STT-M1, STT-M2, STT-Q1, STT-Q2) and others and also among files with identification of
sessions using H-REF methods (H-REF1, H-REF2) and others. The basic difference among quantity
and quality of extracted rules is that, in case of quality comparison, statistically significant difference
was not proved in method of session identification using H-REF method without path completion (HREF1) and using H-REF method with path completion (H-REF2).

4 Conclusion
The session identification based on the Reference Length is conditioned with the exponential
distribution of the Length, which, however, does not have it in our case. The need of the exponential
distribution of the Length seems to be the biggest problem of this method. There is a probability that
even small deviations from the exponential distribution affect the correct calculation of the border
time. The experiment was carried out on the log file of the commercial bank in the year 2010. Before
running the experiment, we examined the distribution of the Length at the university portal as well as
the newer log files of the bank portal. In both cases, the exponential distribution of the Length was not
confirmed.
The second problem of the Reference Length method appears to be the portion of navigation
pages. It is obvious that, with increasing age of internet portal, the number of content pages increases
more than navigation ones. If we take a look on news portals, the navigation pages with links to stories
categories grow slower than pages with stories itself. The border time C depends on the portion of
navigation and contents pages. From this perspective, the portion significantly limits the use of this
method.
The results of the H-ref method were disappointing. The methods itself try to create meaningful
sessions. We improved the method by employing the path completion. Even after this enhancement,
there are still statistically significant differences in the quantity of extracted rules when using the path
completion or not. If we take a look on the quality of rules, there are no statistical differences. The
method can be used for portals that are characteristic with flood visitors, e.g. e-auctions, e-tickets.
The best results were achieved by employing user session identification methods based on the
threshold time (STT). We think that if we want to achieve the best results regarding the quality of pre-

processed data, we have to use the method of STT to the log file. The value of STT is calculated from
formula:
(1)

       ,

where  stand for the last record with the web site access time in investigated session,
 stand for the first record with the access time in new session,
 stand for the last value of upper quartile of the Length variable
and  stand for the quartile range of the Length variable.
The experiment proved that the session identification based on STT calculated according the
formula (1) is the most appropriate for gathering the sequence of pages visited by a particular user.
Getting the value of the Length variable as well as the calculation of quartile ranges can be in most
cases problematic in technological, economic a time view. The experiment proved that comparable
results are obtained by identifying the sessions using STT with a value equal to the average of the
Length, i.e. the average time that the user spent on the examined pages. This value is usually available
in standard systems for the web analysis.
