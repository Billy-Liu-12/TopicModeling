Abstract
This paper propose a new algorithm, termed as LPTWSVM, for binary classiﬁcation problem
by seeking two nonparallel hyperplanes which is an improved method for TWSVM. We improve
the recently proposed ITSVM and develop Generalized ITSVM. A linear function is chosen in
the object function of Generalized ITSVM which leads to the primal problems of LPTWSVM.
Comparing with TWSVM, a 1-norm regularization term is introduced to the objective function to implement structural risk minimization and the quadratic programming problems are
changed to linear programming problems which can be solved fast and easily. Then we do
not need to compute the large inverse matrices or use any optimization trick in solving our
linear programs and the dual problems are unnecessary in the paper. We can introduce kernel
function directly into nonlinear case which overcome the serious drawback of TWSVM. The
numerical experiments verify that our LPTWSVM is very eﬀective.

Introduction

Support vector machines(SVMs), as machine learning methods which were constructed on
the VC-dimension theory and the principle of structural risk minimization, were proposed
by Corinna Cortes and Vapnik in 1995 [1–3]. With the evolution of SVMs, they have shown
much advantages in classiﬁcation with small samples, nonlinear classiﬁcation and high dimensional pattern recognition and also they can be applied in solving other machine learning problems [4–10]. The standard support vector classiﬁcation attempts to minimize generalization
error by maximizing the margin between two parallel hyperplanes, which results in dealing
with an optimization task involving the minimization of a convex quadratic function. But some

classiﬁers based on nonparallel hyperplanes were proposed recently. The generalized eigenvalue
proximal support vector machine(GEPSVM) and twin support vector machine(TWSVM) are
two typical classiﬁcation methods and are also very popular. TWSVM seeks two nonparallel
hyperplanes and make each hyperplane close to one class and far from the other as much as
possible. However, the structural risk was not considered in TWSVM which may aﬀect the
computational eﬃciency and accuracy. Based on TWSVM, TBSVM and ITSVM was proposed
in [11, 12] which introduces a regularization term into the objective function and their experiments perform better than TWSVM. The main contribution of the twin bounded support
vector machine(TBSVM) is that the principle of structural risk minimization is implemented
by adding the regularization term in the primal problems. And the advantages of the improved
twin support vector machine(ITSVM) are that it can apply kernel trick directly in the nonlinear case and it does not need to compute inverse matrices. TWSVM have been studied
extensively [13–19].
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to classiﬁcation problem which involves two
nonparallel hyperplanes in two linear optimization problems, termed as LPTWSVM, for binary
classiﬁcation. Since ITSVM is a successful method as an improved version of TWSVM, we
develop Generalized ITSVM which follows the idea in [20]. LPTWSVM replaces the abstract
function in the objective function of Generalized ITSVM with 1-norm terms and then we convert
them to linear programs which can be solved easily and quickly and inherits the advantage
of ITSVM. We can implement the principle of structural minimization and avoid computing
inverse matrices. Also kernel function can be introduced to nonlinear case directly as the
standard SVMs usually do.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 brieﬂy introduces two algorithms, the original
TWSVM and ITSVM; Section 3 proposes our new method LPTWSVM; Numerical experiments
are implemented in Section 4 and concluding remarks are summarized in Section 5.

Background

In this section, we introduce the original TWSVM and its improved algorithm ITSVM.

2.1

TWSVM

Consider the binary classiﬁcation problem with the training set
T = {(x1 , +1), · · · , (xp , +1), (xp+1 , −1), · · · , (xp+q , −1)},

(2.1)

where xi ∈ Rn , i = 1, · · · , p+q. Let A = (x1 , · · · , xp )T ∈ Rp×n , B = (xp+1 , · · · , xp+q )T ∈ Rq×n ,
and l = p + q.
TWSVM constructs the following primal problems

where ci , i=1,2,3,4 are the penalty parameters, e+ and e− are vectors of ones, ξ+ and ξ− are
slack vectors, e+ , ξ+ ∈ Rp , e− , ξ− ∈ Rq . The decision function is denoted by
Class = arg min |(wk · x) + bk |

(2.6)

where | · | is the absolute value.

LPTWSVM

In this section, based on ITSVM, we ﬁrst develop Generalized ITSVM and then introduce our
LPTWSVM which changes the 2-norm terms in the objective function of ITSVM to 1-norm
terms and then get a pair of linear programs.

In this section, we consider using linear function f, g in the objective function generated from
the mathematical program (3.13)-(3.20) thus leading to linear programs. We chose 1-norm
λ+ , α+ , λ− , α− for f, g and change the η term to 1-norm form which leads to the following

Then an unknown point is predicted to the class by (2.6) where w+ , b+ , w− , b− are same as
(3.1) and (3.2).
In nonlinear case, we introduce the transformation x = Φ(x) and the corresponding kernel
function K(x, x ) = (Φ(x) · Φ(x )) where x∈ H, H is the Hilbert space. So the training set (2.1)
becomes

Numerical Experiments

In this section, we have made numerical experiments to show the advantages of our algorithm.
In order to get more objective results, some datasets were partially selected from the primary
datasets to get balanced datasets. All the optimal parameters are selected through searching
the set {10−2 , · · · , 102 }. The best accuracy of each dataset is obtained by three-fold cross
validation method.
We performed the experiments in linear case and nonlinear case respectively. All experiments
were implemented in MATLAB 2012a on a PC with a Intel Core 2 processor with 2GB RAM
and all datasets were come from the UCI machine learning Repository. All samples were scaled
to the interval [0,1] before training to improve the computational eﬃciency. For all the methods,
we applied the RBF kernel K(x, x ) = exp(−μ x − x 2 ) to nonlinear case. The ”Accuracy”
used to evaluate methods is deﬁned same as [12]. Accuracy=(TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN),
where TP, FP, TN and FN is the number of true positive, false positive, true negative and false
negative, respectively. The experiments results are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The best
accuracy is signed by bold-face.
In Table 1, we compare our LPTWSVM with SVC, TWSVM and ITSVM in linear case, the
classiﬁcation accuracy and the optimal parameters are listed. In fact, for ITSVM, the choice
of c3 and c4 aﬀects the results signiﬁcantly which shows that there are only two parameters
to be tuned in practice [12]. For LPTWSVM, there are four parameters need to be tuned and
every parameter can aﬀect the results markedly. But it is observed that, in most cases, the
best accuracy is got when c1 = c2 and c3 = c4 which can save much training time in practice.
We have more space to adjust the parameters which leads to higher classiﬁcation accuracy.
We compare LPTWSVM with SVC, TWSVM and ITSVM in nonlinear case in Table 2. All
methods can get better accuracy since the kernel function is introduced. Our LPTWSVM have
achieved the best accuracy in seven datasets.
In summary, we can see that LPTWSVM has got higher accuracy than the other methods on
most datasets which demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our LPTWSVM in binary classiﬁcation.

Conclusion

In this paper, based on TWSVM and ITSVM, we have proposed another improved method
for binary classiﬁcation, terms as LPTWSVM. Instead of solving a large sized programming
problems in standard SVMS , we solve two linear optimization problems of a smaller size in
LPTWSVM similar as ITSVM. ITSVM has been developed to Generalized ITSVM and we get
our primal problems by using a linear function in the objective function of Generalized ITSVM.
In contrast to the original TWSVM, our LPTWSVM introduced 1-norm regularization term
to the objective function which contribute to the structural risk minimization. The primal
problems of LPTWSVM can be converted to linear programs easily and the weights between
the regularization term and empirical risk can be adjusted freely. Furthermore, we do not need
to calculate the inversion of matrices which can aﬀect the computational accuracy. Numerical
experiments have been made on ten datasets and the results show that our LPTWSVM performs better on most datasets, namely, we have higher generalization ability. The idea can be
extended to regression machine, knowledge-based learning in future work.
