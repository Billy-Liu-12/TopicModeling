and understand experiences and people sentiments [7]. People can easily share their observations,
experiences, feelings and thoughts quickly on finger tips by sending short messages known as “Tweets”
of at most 140 characters long [8].
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, related work is presented. Section 3
describes method and data collection process; development of health practice framework (HELP) based
on detailed analysis and discussion. Finally, Section 4 conclude the paper.

2 Related Work
One can achieve quick information sharing through the usage of the plethora of social media
applications. Researchers and academicians have more explicitly shown interest in taking a more
informed decision and getting insightful answers utilizing social media data [9]. However, currently, no
work targets to understand citizens’ experiences using social media data during the period of increase
in Air pollution. Though many scholars recognize and advocate the use of Twitter data to analyze
important events. For example, people could help, reach out and observe actions aftermath of the 2011
Japanese earthquake and tsunami [10-12]. Scholars attribute the presence and contribution of Twitter
data for predicting flu outbreaks far ahead of the government analysis [13]. Scholars also use Twitter to
spread climate change awareness and to understand SPENC motivations during war and attacks [1415]. Scholars start developing various approaches, tools and techniques and Liu et al. in their research
work survey critical approaches [16]. Other researchers present the mining of massive data useful in
understanding opinion and sentiments. For example, Jiang et al. [17] present unique approach of
classifying tweets in to three categories based on the sentiments - positive, negative or neutral. Scholars
also shown interest to understand the group sentiments spread over different regions having different
behaviors patterns. In one of the research work researchers present findings to establish effective
international alliance relationships Chambers et al. [18].

3 HELP Framework - Analysis and Discussion
The authors select Twitter search API to explore the content of the prominent hashtag
#RighttoBreathe for data collection and analysis. The data set is built and analyzed utilizing
socialbearing, R, Hadoop analytics platform and Twitter packages and APIs. The data set comprised of
the tweets that were generated exactly after the Diwali festival i.e. 31st October 2016 for five days. This
research contributes to the understanding of citizens’ experiences during the increase in Air pollution to
explore deeper insights in people sentiments and to develop Health Practice framework - HELP.
Authors in the previous research work [7, 15] attempt to categorize and classify tweets using manual
code, which is very prominent, and the same coding technique is utilized for classification of the tweets
in the current research work. Four categories were identified: information-related, opinion-related,
emotion-related, and action-related [7, 15, 18]. The tweets can either be placed in a non-overlapping
category or belong to overlapping category when it intersects more than one classification category for
example action-related and emotion-related. In this section, the analysis and discussion of the Twitter
data for the #RighttoBreathe is illustrated. It is evident in Fig.1a that people have almost equally
contributed messages over Twitter application thus 48.3% were tweets and 42.1% tweets were
retweeted. It signifies that people were engaged in dialogues and discussions about the event – Air
pollution. Android has surpassed the usage of other platforms by capturing overall 56.4% of coverage
for the access of Twitter application and this shown the dominance and accessibility of open source
platform, see Fig.1b. Out of 10 different prominent media channels used for tweeting, Twitter
application captures the bigger user base, see Fig. 1c. In Fig. 1d, it is found that people are concerned

about the cause of “right to breathe” and “air pollution”. People sentiments were identified, and 20.2%
people felt that they are happy to be associated for the cause; 22.7% people felt bad about “Air
pollution”. Though 42.4% are unsure about their feeling regarding the action to fight against “air
pollution” and thus shows neutral feeling. Timeline of the tweets are identified in Fig. 1e.

Opinion-related tweets dominated the tweets that were shared over the Twitter application. It was also
found that tweets also provided navigational information to other social media sites or channels.
Predominantly, people engaged themselves to express views, observations, information, emotions,
feelings and other types of content over the Twitter. A detailed Health practice (HELP) framework is
formulated based on the codification and analysis of the tweets considering #RighttoBreathe, see Figure
2. The framework will help various stakeholders such as citizens, government, regulatory authorities
and other alike to take necessary actions to control, prevent and remove air pollution.

4 Conclusion
A detailed Health practice framework - HELP is formulated based on the codification and analysis
of the tweets considering #RighttoBreathe. The framework is beneficial for various stakeholders such
as citizens, government, regulatory authorities and other alike to take necessary actions to control,
prevent and remove air pollution. Opinion-related tweets dominated the tweets that were shared over
the Twitter application. It is found that tweets also provided navigational information to other social
media sites or channels. Predominantly, people engaged themselves to express views, observations,
information, emotions, feelings and other types of content over the Twitter.
