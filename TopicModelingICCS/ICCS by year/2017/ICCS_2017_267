reduces robustness in the case of complex problems. So, there is need for coming up with a
unified method for addressing stabilization and meshing.
Another important unaddressed question for numerical solutions of convection dominated
problems is if one can actually determine that a particular solution is unphysical without apriori knowledge of the solution. Addressing this question becomes particularly important in
the case of novel problems or situations where one has no clear idea of the actual solution –
a situation that occurs fairly commonly in practical computations. In what follows, we show
how employing a simple entropy principle adapted from the study of hyperbolic conservation
laws can address the above issues in a simple and unified way. The central idea behind the
principle is as follows – Just as the second law of thermodynamics separates unphysical solutions
from physical ones by finding the sign of an entropy variable, it is possible to identify unphysical
portions of a numerical solution by finding the sign of an appropriately defined discrete entropy
production.
Pioneering work on the employment of an entropy principle for numerical discretizations
was done by Tadmor [4,5]. Tadmor characterized the minimum amount of numerical viscosity
required for obtaining discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws that would converge to
the correct weak solution. Merriam [6] further adapted this discrete entropy principle to derive
numerical schemes that satisfied the entropy principle on a cell by cell rather than global basis.
Recently, Guermond et. al. [7] utilized an entropy inequality to derive stabilized, high-order
finite element schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws.
All of the above apply an entropy principle to the computation of hyperbolic conservation
laws. Further, the primary purpose in these has been to compute the correct weak solution
and to calculate flow in non-smooth regions with minimal oscillations. To the best of our
knowledge, there has been no work on deriving an equivalent principle for problems other than
hyperbolic conservation laws, such as the convection-diffusion equation. Furthermore, it has
not been investigated if the same idea could be applied to capturing boundary layers accurately
in smooth flows.
In what follows, we demonstrate different uses for a unified entropy production principle
for convection dominated problems. We show that the same principle may be applied for

Entropy production, detection and stabilization of unphysical behavior
Unphysical behavior in the steady state convection-diffusion problem

Numerical solutions of convection dominated problems show various numerical artefacts that
are particularly visible in high gradient regions of the solution. The simplest example of this is
observed in the solution of the steady state convection-diffusion problem.

with specified boundary conditions. This problem, though simple, has attracted much analysis
in the literature as it represents a simple but powerful prototype of the type of behavior seen

in boundary layer problems with the full Navier-Stokes equations. A host of explanations and
solutions have been offered in the literature for this problem (see [8] for a comprehensive review).
However, all of them invoke some a priori knowledge of the monotonic behavior of the solution.
We provide a new explanation for this numerical behavior which does not depend on any a
priori knowledge of solution behavior and also extends easily to other problems. For this, we
recall the entropy function as used in the study of hyperbolic conservation laws [9]. Given a
scalar hyperbolic conservation law of the form ut + f (u)x = 0, one can define a corresponding
entropy variable S(u), entropy flux F (u) pair provided they satisfy Suu > 0, and Fu = Su fu .
It follows immediately that for a smooth solution St + F (u)x = 0. However, for solutions
with discontinuities, it can be shown that only the correct weak solution satisfies the entropy
inequality St + F (u)x ≤ 0. Merriam [6] first observed (without proof) that the violation of a
discretized version of the above entropy inequality, correlates well with the presence of shock
oscillations for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. We now derive a similar equation for the
(non-hyperbolic) convection-diffusion equation and prove that the satisfying or violation of an
entropy principle correlates exactly with the local presence or absence of oscillations even for
smooth solutions.

The negative term on the right hand side of this auxiliary equation is the scalar equivalent of
the dissipation term in the kinetic energy equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which is known to contribute to the entropy production in the internal energy equation.
Therefore, by analogy to the Navier-Stokes equations and the similar equation in the case of hyperbolic conservation laws, we term this auxiliary equation the “entropy production” equation.
We, therefore, obtain the following entropy production inequality that all (smooth) solutions
of equation (1) must necessarily satisfy,

where S(u) = u2 is the entropy variable. The key observation here is that not all discretizations
of (1) need satisfy a discrete version of (3). We term a discrete solution u(xi ) of (1) as a
“discrete entropy satisfying” solution if it obeys an appropriately chosen, natural discretization
of (3). By a natural discretization we mean that each of the derivative operators in the entropy
equation is discretized identically to the corresponding operator in the discretization in (1). For
instance, for the 2nd order central difference scheme on a uniform grid, (1) is discretized as

The utility of the above discrete inequalities is due to the following properties which they
satisfy:(1) Solutions of (4) exhibit unphysical oscillations if and only if the discrete entropy
inequality (5) is violated. (2) The correct threshold value of (= h/2), above which the central
difference solution (4) is monotonic is automatically obtained by enforcing (5). (3) The upwind
discretization of convective terms in (1) results in the discrete entropy inequality to be always
satisfied.
Proofs We offer concise proofs of the above properties now. Property 1 can be proved by
multiplying (4) by ui+1 + ui−1 and subtracting from (5). Rearrrangement gives

Now, the discrete entropy inequality (5) is satisfied at any grid location xi if ui+1 − ui and
ui −ui−1 have the same sign i.e. the solution is monotonic in [xi−1 , xi+1 ]. Similarly, the presence
of oscillations around a grid location automatically indicates that ui+1 − ui and ui − ui−1 have
different signs, immediately violating the inequality (5), completing the proof.
Property 3 can be similarly proved by multiplying the upwind discretization (6) by ui + ui−1

and subtracting from (7). Rearrangement gives Piupwind = −2ε ui −u

Finally, Property 2 can be proved by letting F = ui+1h−ui and B = ui −u

h . Writing B in terms of F and substituting in (8) gives,Pi = 2 1/2+ε/h F
We immediately conclude that |ε| ≥ h/2 for satisfying the entropy inequality, completing the
proof. We note the following:
• The discrete entropy production operator Pi is simply calculated a posteriori. Wherever
the inequality is violated, one immediately knows that the corresponding region of the
solution is untrustworthy. We require no a priori knowledge of what the solution looks
like. This allows to extend this application to other equations below.
• The amount of violation of the inequality (how positive Pi is) is directly related to how
oscillatory the solution is. Figure 1 confirms this through solutions of the convectiondiffusion equation (1) for two different  along with the corresponding values of the entropy
production. One can observe that a local violation of the entropy inequality matches
perfectly with unphysical behavior.
• This derivation of the threshold value seems to be the first one in the literature which
is done completely independent of the requirement of non-oscillatory behavior of the
solution. We re-emphasize that all we have required of the solution is that it obey the
discrete entropy inequality and the correct threshold value immediately follows.

• We emphasize the remarkable fact that an operator originally derived for identifying
the physically correct discontinuous solution in hyperbolic conservation laws is able to
automatically separate out the incorrect numerical behavior within a completely smooth
solution.

Figure 2 shows a temporally evolving “square wave” for two different values of the coefficients.
As can be seen, for the convection-dominant case the advent of oscillations is correlated with

the violation of the entropy inequality. Further, even within the oscillatory solution, the smooth
sub-regions are correctly identified as entropy satisfying regions.

Scalar singular perturbation problems for convection-dominated problems

The same principle can be extended to any general scalar singular perturbation problem of
the form −εu”(x) − a(x)u (x) + b(x)u(x) = f with the corresponding entropy inequality P =

entropy inequality, we consider the following two classic Riemann problems
Case 1: Under-resolved shock. (uL > uR ). We present a steady state Burgers shock for
which the exact solution is also known. As seen in Figure 3a, when there are no oscillations
in the well-resolved case (i.e.  is above a certain threshold value), the entropy inequality is
satisfied uniformly. Further, as seen in Figure 3b, one obtains oscillations near the shock when
6

the shock is under-resolved and no oscillation in case it is well resolved. One can see that the
entropy inequality is violated precisely wherever the unphysical oscillation occurs.
Case 2: Under-resolved expansion fan (uL < uR ). Improperly resolved expansion fans lead
to a phenomenon known as the sonic glitch [1]. This is an O(h) “expansion shock” at the
sonic point right in the middle of a smooth region and is famously exhibited by even entropysatisfying methods such the Godunov method [1]. The problem, of course, is that a method
may satisfy the entropy condition in the limit of infinitesimal grid sizes but violate it in the
discrete case.
Figure 4 shows an under-resolved expansion with initial conditions being uL = −1 and
uR = 1. We have chosen  = 0.5 for this problem as it clearly exhibits the sonic glitch. It
can be seen that has the entropy inequality is violated right around the sonic glitch while the
inequality is satisfied at other smooth regions. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the
literature that this violation of discrete entropy around the sonic point has been shown.

100 equally spaced mesh points (a) Well resolved solution with  = 0.1 (b) Oscillatory solution
for  = 0.05.

2.2.4

An attempt to stabilize the sonic glitch

We now show that an adapted entropy viscosity method can be used to fix the sonic glitch.
Based on our conjecture that the sonic-glitch is essentially due to local entropy violation, we
adapt the method of Guermond et. al. [7] which works well for shocks, for this expansion fan
case. We have one important difference from the method in [7]. In order to enforce Galilean
invariance, we calculate the entropy based on a local shift of velocity i.e. for every grid point
xi , the entropy production is calculated using the triad of velocities [ui−1 − ui , 0, ui+1 − ui ].
It can be easily seen that
Correspondingly, we use the entropy function S = (u − ui )2 locally.

the corresponding entropy flux is therefore modified to F = 23 u − 3u2 i u2 . The corresponding
entropy equation is P = St + Fx − εSxx = −2ε(ux )2 ≤ 0. As can be seen in Figure 5, the results
we obtain are exceptionally good with our choice. A comparison with the solution obtained

Adaptive meshes for singular perturbation problems

Since the entropy inequality detects regions of unphysical behavior, it can be adapted, almost
unmodified, for adaptive mesh generation for singular perturbation problems. The general
procedure is to compute the a posteriori entropy residuals for a given mesh and adapt around the
region of maxium entropy production. Unlike other standard meshes for singularly perturbed

problems, such as Shishkin and Bakhvalov meshes [3] our method requires no prior knowledge
of the where the boundary layer region lies and requires no arbitrary parameters. We refer the
reader to [ 11] for the details of the implementation of the above strategy as well as detailed
numerical results for a variety of singular perturbation problems. Here, we just present a couple
of results that exhibit the versatility of the method.
Turning Point Problem – We consider a SPP with a turning point [11] −εu + 2(2x − 1) + 4u =
0; x ∈ (0, 1), with the BCs u(1) = 1 ; u(0) = 1. This problem has a turning point, i.e. a sign
change of the convective term at x = 1/2. Consequently, there are two boundary layers in this
problem. Figure 6a shows the final solutions for this problem with  = 10−5 and N = 55.
Interior Layer Problem – As another example, we consider a SPP with an interior layer
point −εu − xu = 0; x ∈ (−1, 1) with the BCs u(−1) = 1 ; u(1) = 2. This problem has an
interior layer, i.e. a “layer” in the inside of the domain instead of the boundaries at x = 0.Figure
6b shows the final solutions for this problem for  = 10−6 and N = 45.
In both cases, we started with just one point within the domain excluding the boundaries
and provided no input on where the sharp gradients were. We notice once again the excellent
results that are obtained without any input on the nature of the problem. Apart from these
cases, we have performed several others with equally excellent results. We know of no other
conventional method that works with such minimal inputs on both the number of points and
nature of the problem. This method for mesh adaptation therefore seems to us to be quite
promising.

Conclusions and future directions

We have presented in this paper a method to utilize a suitably defined discrete entropy production operator and a corresponding inequality for convection dominated problems. For the
case of the convection-diffusion equation we were able to prove that the violation of the inequality is directly related to the advent of unphysical behavior even in smooth regions. In
other convection-dominated cases we presented numerical results that also indicated the ability
of this inequality to identify regions with unphysical behavior such as oscillations and glitches.
Preliminary results for how to utilize this method to fix the identified problems in case of the
sonic glitch were also presented. Finally, it was also shown that the same operator could be
used in SPPs to generate excellent adapted meshes for a range of problems. For utilization
in practical problems, the method needs several extensions. Firstly, the method needs to be
tested on high order finite difference schemes. Also, extensions for finite volume and finite
element methods would allow the method to be used for problems with complex geometries.
Our preliminary results for these appear promising [11]. Finally, we wish to extend the method
to become capable of handling multiple variables (instead of the scalar cases we have presently
done). We shall report on our progress on these questions in future publications.
