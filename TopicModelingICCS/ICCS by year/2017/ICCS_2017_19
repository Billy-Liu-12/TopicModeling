methods. He advocated that such theoretical prediction was consistent with experimental observation
that Al dimer reacts spontaneously with H2 in solid matrix (Xuefeng Wang, 2003). His results
indicated that the potential energy diagram of H2 adsorption on Al2 could not be adequately analyzed
without evaluating dynamical correlation effect. Moc also analyzed the hydrogenation of Al6 using
CCSD(T)//B3LYP method. He found that the singlet state distorted octahedron (D3d) structure is the
most stable structure for the bare Al6 cluster, and discovered the most stable structure for Al6H2
complex, which was not previously reported.
Although their CCSD(T)//B3LYP calculations reproduced the CCSD(T)//CCSD results for H2
adsorption on Al2 qualitatively, it is well known that the accuracy of DFT calculations strongly
depends on the selection of exchange-correlation density functional and DFT sometimes fails to
describe weak interactions, such as van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Indeed, Moc pointed out that
there are significant differences between geometrical parameters in vdW complex of Al2…H2 obtained
by B3LYP and CCSD calculations (Moc, 2005). Thus, we would like to confirm the performance of
several density functoinals to analyze H2 adsorption on Al2. In addition, since proton is the lightest
nucleus, nuclear quantum effect (NQE) sometimes becomes significant. However, such NQEs are
basically ignored in the conventional molecular orbital and DFT calculations based on the BornOppenheimer approximation. On the other hand, we have proposed multicomponent quantum
mechanics (MC_QM) method to directly include NQE of light nuclei (Taro Udagawa K. S., 2015)
(Taro Udagawa T. T., 2014) (Taro Udagawa M. T., 2006) (Masanori Tachikawa, 1998). In our
MC_QM method, not only electrons but also light nuclei (proton and deuteron) are treated as quantum
wavefunctions. Direct treatment of NQEs of light nuclei is important to analyze the reactions, in which
proton(s) takes dominant roles. Therefore, we would like to analyze H2 adsorption on Al2 with the aid
of our MC_QM method. In addition, the difference between NQEs of isotopic species (e.g., proton
and deuteron) directly reflects on electronic structures in MC_QM calculations. Thus, MC_QM
method enables us to analyze H/D isotope effects on molecular properties, such as energies and
geometrical parameters. It is known that deuterium substitution sometimes induces drastic changes of
rate constants (kinetic H/D isotope effect) and geometrical parameters (geometrical H/D isotope
effect). We, thus, also would like to analyze D2 dissociation on Al2 using MC_QM method in this
study.

2 Computational Detail
To calculate H2 dissociation reaction on Al2 efficiently with satisfactory accuracy, we first investigated
the performance of three major density functionals (B3LYP, M06, and ωB97XD). We used aug-ccpVTZ electronic basis set for the calculations. We also calculated the reaction using CCSD(T) and
MP2 methods for comparison. The total energies were refined by CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations
on the optimized geometries.
To take into account the NQE on H2 dissociation reaction, we performed MC_QM calculations. In
MC_QM calculations, only hydrogen nuclei were treated as quantum nuclear wavefunctions. In the
multicomponent framework, new types of correlation effects, such as electron-quantum nuclear and
quantum nuclear-quantum nuclear ones arose. Although we should evaluate these correlation effects to
improve the accuracy of multicomponent calculations, we have already demonstrated that electronquantum nuclear and quantum nuclear-quantum nuclear correlation effects are much smaller than
electron-electron one, and we can analyze H/D isotope effects on chemical reactions adequately if
only electron-electron correlation effect is evaluated. We thus evaluate only electron-electron
correlation effect in this study. The aug-cc-pVTZ electronic basis set and single s-type Gauss type
function (GTF), exp{-α(r-R)2}, were adopted as electronic and nuclear basis sets in MC_MP2
calculations, respectively. The α value in nuclear basis function is the orbital exponent value, which

determines the spatial distribution of nuclear wavefunction. We used α = 24.1825 for H+ and α =
35.6214 for D+ for geometry optimization (Takayoshi Ishimoto, 2006) (Marina Hashimoto, 2016). To
refine the MC_QM total energy, we optimized the spatial distribution of nuclear wavefunctions (αopt
value) at MC_QM optimized geometry (Marina Hashimoto, 2016). T. Then we performed
MC_CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations with optimized αopt value to obtain high-accuracy energies.
To find out the effective transition state (TS) structure on MC_QM effective potential energy
hypersurface (PES), we performed MC_QM-climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)
calculations (Taro Udagawa K. S., 2015).
All multicomponent calculations were performed with the aid of modified version of GAUSSIAN
09 program, and CI-NEB calculations were performed with our homemade program.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Conventional QM calculations
First, we analyzed H2 dissociation reactions on Al2 using DFT (B3LYP, M06, and ωB97XD), MP2,
and CCSD(T) methods. Figure 1 shows the optimized structures of (a) bare Al2 and (b) entrance
complex, and the optimized geometrical parameters of these stationary point structures are shown in
Table 1. The notations used in Tables 1 are depicted in Figure 1. We can see that ωB97XD functional
failed to reproduce Al-Al distance of bare Al2 . The ωB97XD optimized R(Al-Al) distance (2.544 Å)
is much shorter than CCSD(T) one (2.977 Å). Significant differences between the optimized
geometrical parameters obtained with DFT and CCSD(T) methods appear in entrance complex. First,
we would like to focus on the B3LYP and M06 optimized geometrical parameters. The R(H-H) bond
length and R(Al…H1) distances are 0.852 Å and 1.945 Å in B3LYP geometry, and 0.847 Å and 1.972
Å in M06 geometry, which are clearly longer and shorter compared to the CCSD(T) values of 0.749 Å
and 2.874 Å, respectively. In other word, H-H bond has already begun to split in entrance complex
structure in B3LYP and M06 results. Dispersion correction in DFT scheme slightly improved the
description of entrance complex. ωB97XD calculation gave a bit longer R(H-H) bond length
compared to B3LYP and M06 ones, however, R(Al…H1) distance is still underestimated in ωB97XD
calculation. It should be noted here that ωB97XD calculation failed to reproduce bare Al2, as
mentioned above. Although these three density functionals gave the reasonable structures for other
stationary point structures, our results implied that DFT was not a good choice to analyze H2
adsorption on Alx clusters. On the other hand, MP2 calculations gave the reasonable geometrical
parameters for all stationary point structures. In entrance complex, R(Al…H1) distance in MP2
geometry is still slightly (0.237 Å) shorter than that in CCSD(T) one. However, R(H-H) bond length
obtained in MP2 calculation is almost equivalent to that obtained in CCSD(T) calculation. In
CCSD(T) and MP2 geometries, H2 molecule has not been ‘activated’, yet, in entrance complex.
Therefore, only MP2 method gave the reasonable stationary point structures for H2 adsorption reaction

Figure 2 shows the potential energy diagram of the H2 adsorption reaction on Al2 obtained using
CCSD(T) and MP2 methods. It should be noted that TS4-5 corresponds to TS1-4 in the Moc’s
previous study (Moc, 2005). We found that TS4-5 connects the stationary points 4 and 5, while Moc
reported that TS1-4 connects 4 and 1. Differences between MP2 and CCSD(T) relative energies are
smaller than 2.7 kcal/mol. While TSH-H was not found in MP2 calculation, MP2 calculations
reproduced the CCSD(T) relative energies well. The activation barrier from entrance complex to TSHH is only 1.2 kcal/mol in CCSD(T) results, which indicates that the potential energy surface in the
vicinity of TSH-H is very flat, hence TSH-H is not found in MP2 result. Zero point vibrational energy
(ZPVE) correction slightly stabilized and unstabilized entrance complex and TSH-H, respectively.
Consequently, TSH-H lies 0.1 kcal/mol lower than entrance complex in ZPVE-corrected CCSD(T)
relative energies (shown in parenthesis). The CCSD(T) potential energy diagram can be efficiently
reproduced by performing CCSD(T) energy calculations on MP2 optimized geometries
(CCSD(T)//MP2). Figure 2 also shows the potential energy diagram obtained in CCSD(T)//MP2
calculations. The potential energy diagram obtained by CCSD(T)//MP2 calculations is almost
equivalent to that obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. Only the CCSD(T)/MP2 relative energy of
entrance complex is 0.1 kcal/mol higher than CCSD(T) one. Therefore, we have demonstrated that
MP2 method is the best choice to optimize stationary point structures of H2 adsorption reaction on Al2,
and the CCSD(T) potential energy diagram is almost completely reproduced by CCSD(T)//MP2
calculations.

3.2 Multicomponent QM calculations
To analyze H2 adsorption reaction on Al2 including NQE of hydrogen nuclei, we performed
MC_CCSD(T)//MC_MP2 calculations. The optimized structures and the geometrical parameters are
shown in Figure 3. We can find that H-H and Al-H distances become longer by including NQE of
proton or deuteron. For example, H-H distances in H2 are in the order of quantum H > quantum D >
classical H. These elongations are due to the direct inclusion of anharmonicity of the potential energy
curve along the covalent bond direction. On the other hand, Al-Al distances are less affected by NQE
of proton and deuteron.
The potential energy diagram of H2 adsorption reaction obtained by MC_CCSD(T)//MC_MP2
calculation (quantum H) is shown in Figure 4. It should be noted that not only TSH-H but also
entrance complex is not found in quantum H result. This result is reasonable, since TSH-H is already
lower than entrance complex in the ZPVE-corrected CCSD(T) relative energies, as mentioned above.
Wang and coworkers reported that Al2 could react spontaneously with H2 molecule in solid matrix.
Our MC_QM results are also consistent with Wang’s experimental observation, since there are no
activation barriers for adsorption process of H2 in MC_QM results, as in the case of the ZPVEcorrected conventional QM results. We also investigated the D2 dissociation reaction on Al2 using

2279

Taro Udagawa et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 2275–2281

MC_CCSD(T)//MC_MP2 method. The potential energy diagram of stationary point structures of D2
adsorption reaction (quantum D) is also shown in Figure 4. In quantum D result, entrance complex
and TSH-H are not found as well as in quantum H result. Although NQE stabilized the stationary
points structures in both quantum H and quantum D, NQE did not change the order of the stabilities.
Our MC_QM results indicate that not only H2 but also D2 can spontaneously react with Al2, since
there are no activation barriers in adsorption process of D2, as well as the case of H2 adsorption.
Let us summarize H2 dissociation reaction on Al2. We have elucidated that DFT cannot reproduce
the CCSD(T) structure of the van der Waals complex (entrance complex). Not only B3LYP and M06
but also wB97XD, which includes empirical dispersion correction, underestimated the Al…H distances
in entrance complex. The CCSD(T) energy estimation at MP2 optimized geometries (CCSD(T)//MP2)
almost perfectly reproduced the energy diagram obtained by pure CCSD(T) calculations. Therefore,
we clearly demonstrated here that DFT is not suitable to analyze H2 dissociation reactions on Aln
clusters. Instead, we should choose the methods, which can describe van der Waals interaction, such
as MP2 and CCSD(T).

4 Conclusions
We have investigated the performance of several density functionals for the analysis of H2 dissociation
on small aluminum cluster. We clearly demonstrated that no density functionals reproduce the
CCSD(T)-optimized geometry of entrance complex well, although ωB97XD density functional
includes the empirical dispersion correction. In the DFT-optimized geometries, H2 molecule is already
activated in entrance complex, since H-H distance in entrance complex is clearly longer than
CCSD(T)-optimized one. Only MP2 method provides the reasonable optimized geometry of entrance

complex. Therefore, calculation method must be carefully chosen to analyze H2 dissociation reaction
on Alx clusters. We would like to suggest that hydrogenation of Al6 also should be revisited with the
precise ab initio methods, such as MP2 or CCSD(T). We revealed that nuclear quantum effect (NQE)
provides significant effect on H-H and Al-H distances, whereas Al-Al bond length only slightly
changes by NQE of proton and deuteron. Our MC_CCSD(T)//MC_MP2 calculation also revealed that
NQE of proton and deuteron lowers the relative energies of stationary point structures. Large
stabilization appears in H2 dissociation reaction rather than D2 one, reflecting the larger NQE of proton
than that of deuteron.
