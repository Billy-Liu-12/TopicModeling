Drug (IND) applications filed at FDA. Computer simulations can also guide the design of human
clinical trials.
Recently, a study of molecular modeling of structural and conformational relationships in tRNA
complexation with chloroethyl nitrosourea derivatives was published (Agarwal, 2017). These
derivatives are used as chemotherapeutic agents against cancers including brain tumors, Hodgkin's
disease, small cell lung cancer, and malignant melanoma. Molecular modeling has been recently used
to analyze hydrogen bonding to Thr120 and Thr124 for thiadiazolodiazepine analogs used as
neuromuscular blocking agents (El-Subbagh, 2017). Poureshghi et al. have used spectroscopic
techniques combined with molecular modeling methods to study the interaction between lamotrigine
and human serum albumin (Poureshghi, 2017) Phenylpicolinamide derivatives have been modeled
using SURFLEX-DOCK module of the SYBYL package (Zhu, 2016)
Boehling et al. have published a simulation experiment using the discrete element method to
study the influence of process parameters including spray rate, number of nozzles, drum rotation rate,
and drum load on the inter-tablet coating variation (Boehling, Analysis of large-scale tablet coating:
Modeling, simulation and experiments, 2016). Boehling et al. have also studied the scale up process
for spray coating computationally. Industrial scale up can be a complicated process and sometimes
fails (Boehling, 2016b). Sensitivity analyses of a simulated pharmaceutical direct compaction process
using Sobol indices and based on steady-state gains and the frequency response of a planned
production plant were conducted by Rehrl et al. (Rehrl, 2017). The continuous manufacturing of
artemisinin has been studied by process simulations (Jolliffe, 2016).
Of the three major applications of simulation in pharmaceutical development, clinical trial
simulations are perhaps the most challenging. The challenge arises from the need to model the
behavior of a small group of individual human subjects. A company working to get a single drug to
market can expect to spend at least $350 million before the medicine is approved for sale. Because so
many new drug candidates fail, large pharmaceutical companies that are working on dozens of drug
projects simultaneously spend $5 billion per new drug (Herper, 2013).
Clinical trial simulations can reduce the risk of conducting clinical trials and thus reduce the
costs. Mileham et al. have published on risk modeling for clinical trial patient accrual (Mileham,
2016). Banks et al. have conducted simulations of clinical trials with missing data (Banks, 2017).
Basu used modeling to resolve differences between two recent randomized clinical trials intended to
measure the benefits and harms of blood pressure treatments in patients with cardiovascular disease
(Basu, 2017). Finally, Bayesian approaches are being increasingly applied to design and analysis of
clinical trials. Wang et al. took a Bayesian approach to an interim futility analysis of a clinical trial
(Wang, 2016).

2 Purpose
The purpose of this study is to use simulations and modeling in a new way: to obviate the need
for extensive preclinical formulation and toxicology studies, and to thereby speed a candidate Ebola
therapeutic to the clinic.
To achieve this purpose, data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are combined with data on shipments from food ingredient
manufacturers to estimate exposure of the US population through foods to a candidate pharmaceutical
formulation ingredient, beta cyclodextrin (BCD). Formulation is important in drug delivery. A poor
formulation can render a drug product useless. A large amount of preclinical research must be
performed before a new drug candidate can be tested in humans. The cost of these cGxP studies is
typically $3-$5 million. If the wrong drug product formulation is tested preclinically, new iterations of
the formulation must be retested with additional costs. BSN389 Is a diterpene antibiotic designed for
treatment of Ebola virus infections. The drug arrests viral replication in the body while antibody

therapies are administered to eliminate the virus. However, the drug is poorly soluble in water,
reducing circulating blood levels of the drug. The goal of formulation is to increase the solubility and
bioavailability.
Data-driven computational science can help reduce the cost. In the absence of existing human
exposure, a battery of tests involving acute and chronic toxicology, cardiovascular, central nervous
system, and respiratory safety pharmacology must be performed in at least two species before FDA
will permit testing in humans. However, for many compounds (such as those beginning with natural
products) there is a history of human exposure. In these cases, computer modeling of a population to
determine human exposure may be adequate to permit phase 0-1 studies with a candidate formulation
in humans.
The CDC’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a set of studies
designed to evaluate the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.
NHANES is unique in that it combines interviews and dietary information with physical examinations
including laboratory results. The NHANES database can be mined to determine the distribution of
exposures to a food additive, and early human formulation testing conducted at levels beneath those to
which the US population is ordinarily exposed through food. These data can be combined with data
mined from international chemical shipments to validate an exposure model. This paper describes the
data driven formulation testing process using a new candidate Ebola treatment that, unlike vaccines,
can be used after a person has contracted the disease. This BSN389’s mechanism of action permits it
to be potentially used against all strains of the virus, a characteristic that vaccines might not share.

3 β-Cyclodextrin Uses in Food and Pharmaceuticals
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are available in three common varieties: α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin and γcyclodextrin, which are together called the first generation (or parent) cyclodextrins. These
cyclodextrins are composed of six (α), seven (β) and eight (γ) -(1,4)-linked glycosyl units formed into
a ring. This ring-shaped molecule is hydrophilic on the outside (so the CD can dissolve in water) and
has a nonpolar cavity inside, which provides a hydrophobic environment. Because of this
hydrophobic cavity, cyclodextrins are able to form inclusion complexes with a variety of hydrophobic
guest molecules. The fact that β cyclodextrin is used in both food and pharmaceuticals complicates
BCD exposure estimates, and means that manufacturers must be careful when adding what seems to
be a small amount of BCD to a product because that small amount may be enough to drive a consumer
already consuming BCDs from other sources above the Acceptable Daily Intake limit.
CDs are well understood from a regulatory point of view, and a monograph for BCD appeared
decades ago in both the US Pharmacopoeia/National Formulary and the European Pharmacopoeia (Del
Valle, 2004).

3.1 β-Cyclodextrin
The oral LD50 in the rat is greater than 5000 mg/kg, and the i.v. LD50 in the rat is between 450
and 790 mg/kg. BCD is less irritating than α-cyclodextrin after i.m. injection. BCD binds cholesterol
and only very small amounts (1–2%) are absorbed in the upper intestinal tract after oral
administration.

3.2 Applications of β-Cyclodextrin
In a CD each guest molecule is effectively microencapsulated. This encapsulation is employed to
produce favorable changes in the chemical and physical properties of the guest molecules, including.
• Improving the solubility of guest molecule.

	

Robert A. Lodder et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1612–1621

• Immobilizing very volatile substances.
• Turning liquid forms into powders.
• Modifying the chemical reactivity of guest molecules.
• Stabilizing photosensitive or oxygen-sensitive molecules.
• Protecting molecules from degradation by microorganisms.
• Masking of bad color, smell or taste.
These types of uses of cyclodextrins and CD derivatives motivate their many applications in food
and pharmaceuticals, and increase the possibility of human exposure.

3.3 Foods and flavors
CDs are used in food preparations for flavor protection or flavor delivery. In foods CDs form
inclusion complexes with many different types of molecules including lipids, flavors and colors. Most
natural and artificial flavors are volatile oils or liquids, and complexing them with CDs provides an
alternative to other encapsulation technologies used for flavor protection. CDs are also employed as
process aids, e.g., to remove cholesterol from products like milk, butter and eggs. CDs can have a
texture-improving effect on pastry and on meat products. Other applications include reducing
bitterness, unpleasant smells and tastes, and stabilizing flavors subjected to long-term storage.
Emulsions like mayonnaise, margarine or butter creams can be stabilized with α-cyclodextrin. As a
result, CDs are found in many foods to which consumers are exposed.
Cyclodextrins are useful in pharmaceuticals for many of the same reasons that they are useful in
foods. For example, the addition of α- or β-cyclodextrin increases the water solubility of poorly
water-soluble drugs. In some cases improving solubility improves bioavailability, increasing the
effectiveness of the drug and enabling a reduction in dose. Cyclodextrins can be used analytically or
preparatively in the separation of drug stereoisomers by the formation of β-cyclodextrin inclusion
complexes (Armstrong, 1986). As a result, CDs are found in pharmaceuticals to which consumers are
exposed.

3.4 Assessment of β-Cyclodextrin Use
An assessment of the consumption of BCD by the U.S. population resulting from the approved
uses of BCD was conducted. Estimates for the intake of BCD were based on the approved food uses
and maximum use level in conjunction with food consumption data included in the National Center for
Health Statistics’ (NCHS) 2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) (Prevention, 2005) (USDA, 2012); (Bodner-Montville J, 2006).
Calculations for the mean and 90th percentile intakes were performed for representative approved
food uses of BCD combined (see Appendix for lists of food codes used). The intakes were reported for
the following population groups:

4 Food Consumption Survey Data
4.1 Survey Description
The most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for the years
2013-2014 are available for public use. NHANES are conducted as a continuous, annual survey, and
are released in 2-year cycles. In each cycle, approximately 10,000 people across the U.S. completed
the health examination component of the survey. Any combination of consecutive years of data
collection is a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. It is well established that the
length of a dietary survey affects the estimated consumption of individual users and that short-term
surveys, such as the typical 1-day dietary survey, overestimate consumption over longer time periods.
Because two 24-hour dietary recalls administered on 2 non-consecutive days (Day 1 and Day 2) are
available from the NHANES 2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 surveys, these data were used to
generate estimates for the current intake analysis.
The NHANES provide the most appropriate data for evaluating food-use and food-consumption
patterns in the United States, containing 2 years of data on individuals selected via stratified
multistage probability sample of civilian non-institutionalized population of the U.S. NHANES
survey data were collected from individuals and households via 24-hour dietary recalls administered
on 2 non-consecutive days (Day 1 and Day 2) throughout all 4 seasons of the year. Day 1 data were
collected in-person in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), and Day 2 data were collected by
telephone in the following 3 to 10 days, on different days of the week, to achieve the desired degree of
statistical independence. The data were collected by first selecting Primary Sampling Units (PSUs),
which were counties throughout the U.S. Small counties were combined to attain a minimum
population size. These PSUs were segmented and households were chosen within each segment. One
or more participants within a household were interviewed. Fifteen PSUs are visited each year. For
example, in the 2009-2010 NHANES, there were 13,272 persons selected; of these 10,253 were
considered respondents to the MEC examination and data collection. 9754 of the MEC respondents
provided complete dietary intakes for Day 1 and of those providing the Day 1 data, 8,405 provided
complete dietary intakes for Day 2.
Sample weights were incorporated with NHANES surveys to compensate for the potential underrepresentation of intakes from specific population groups as a result of sample variability due to
survey design, differential non-response rates, or other factors, such as deficiencies in the sampling
frame (Prevention, 2005) (USDA, 2012).

4.2 Statistical Methods
Consumption data from individual dietary records, detailing food items ingested by each survey
participant, were collated by computer in Matlab and used to generate estimates for the intake of BCD
by the U.S. population. Estimates for the daily intake of BCD represent projected 2-day averages for
each individual from Day 1 and Day 2 of NHANES data; these average amounts comprised the
distribution from which mean and percentile intake estimates were produced. Mean and percentile
estimates were generated incorporating sample weights in order to provide representative intakes for
the entire U.S. population. “All-user” intake refers to the estimated intake of BCD by those individuals
consuming food products containing BCD. Individuals were considered users if they consumed 1 or
more food products containing BCD on either Day 1 or Day 2 of the survey.

Of course, every food category in which BCD is approved for use does not necessarily incorporate
BCD into every product at the maximum approved use level. As a result, the values in Table 2 are
corrected using the total amount of BCD consumed in food in the United States during the period of
the survey. The correction was derived from US population numbers and market research on the
global β cyclodextrin industry (Research, 2016). The US population numbers by year for 2010, 2012,
and 2014 are 308.11 million , 312.86 million, and 317.68 million, respectively (US population
numbers, 2017).
To derive the correction factor the US population number for 2014 was multiplied by the fraction
of people aged two and up in the US consuming the targeted food codes:
317680000 persons x 0.5216 = 1.65702e+008, or 165.702 million BCD consumers
971 tons of BCD were consumed in US foods in 2014 (see Figure 1). This number was converted
to grams and divided by the number of BCD consumers in the United States to give:
971000000/165702000 = 5.859 g/consumer/yr
Dividing the grams per consumer per year by 365 gives grams per consumer per day, or 0.01605.
To derive the correction factor the maximum g/consumer/day for ages 2+ in the NHANES table is
divided by the actual g/day, 0.5617/0.01605 = 35.0. The estimated maximum exposures provided by
the 2013-2014 NHANES were divided by 35 to get estimated actual exposures in Table 2.

Figure 1. Annual US β cyclodextrin consumption by year (metric tons)
BCD exposure from foods is forecast to increase in the near future. There is a correlation between
BCD total consumption and exposure estimated from NHANES. Linear modeling of the NHANES
data predicts exposure will reach 19 mg by 2020 in the age 2 and up group (see Figure 2).

	

Robert A. Lodder et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1612–1621

Figure 2. The mass of BCD consumed by users in the US is forecast to increase to 19
mg/person/day in the age 2 and up group by the year 2020.
Much of the increased exposure to BCD seems to come from an increasing number of food codes
in categories permitted to incorporate BCD. Figure 3 shows the number of food codes increasing
through 2020, which is also correlated to the amount of BCD consumed.

Figure 3. Every year more food codes are added to categories of foods permitted to incorporate
BCD. By 2020 nearly 600 food codes containing BCD may be listed in the FNDDS.

6 Conclusions
In summary, 52.2% of the total U.S. population of 2+ years was identified as consumers of BCD
from the approved food uses. The mean intakes of BCD by the all BCD consumers (“all-user”) from
all approved food uses were estimated to be 16 mg/person/day or 0.2 mg/kg body weight/day. The
heavy consumer (90th percentile all-user) intakes of BCD from all approved food-uses were estimated
to be 36.3 mg/person/day or 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day. The initial human clinical studies of
BSN389 will use 1.5 µg of BCD. This is four orders of magnitude less than the expected daily intake
from food uses, and far less than the amount required to take the average consumer from the 50th to
the 90th percentile. For this reason, use of BCD in the BSN 389 formulation is an insignificant
addition to daily intake and should be safe for subjects in the trial.
