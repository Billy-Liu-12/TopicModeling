2 RBF Interpolation
Meshless (meshfree) methods are based on the idea of Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation
[2], [22], [22], [16], which is not separable, and lead to a solution of a linear system equations (LSE)
with a full or sparse matrix [4], [5]. The RBF interpolation is based on computing of the distance of two
points in the 𝑑𝑑-dimensional space and is defined by a function:
𝑁𝑁

𝑁𝑁

𝑓𝑓(𝒙𝒙) = ∑ 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝜑𝜑(‖𝒙𝒙 − 𝒙𝒙𝑗𝑗 ‖) = ∑ 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝜑𝜑(𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗 )
𝑗𝑗=1
2

𝑗𝑗=1

Formally: 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗 = ‖𝒙𝒙 − 𝒙𝒙𝑗𝑗 ‖2 ≝ √(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 ) + (𝑦𝑦 − 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗 ) = √(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 ) + (𝑦𝑦 − 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗 ) + (1 − 1)2

𝒙𝒙 = [𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦: 1]𝑇𝑇 is expressed in homogeneous coordinates for 𝑑𝑑 = 2 case, 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 are weights to be computed.
In the case of the projective space representation 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ‖𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 − 𝒙𝒙𝑗𝑗 ‖𝑃𝑃 ≝ ‖𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝒙𝒙𝑗𝑗 ‖𝑃𝑃 =

√(𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 ) + (𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗 ) + (𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ) = √(𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 ) + (𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑗𝑗 )

It means that for the given data set {〈𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 , ℎ𝑖𝑖 〉}1𝑁𝑁 , where ℎ𝑖𝑖 are associated values to be interpolated and 𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖
are domain coordinates, we obtain a linear system of equations:
𝑁𝑁

ℎ𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓(𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝜑𝜑(‖𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 − 𝒙𝒙𝑗𝑗 ‖)  + 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 (𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 )
𝑗𝑗=1

𝒙𝒙 = [𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦: 1]𝑇𝑇

𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁𝑁

Due to some stability issues, usually a polynomial 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 (𝒙𝒙) of a degree k is added. Mostly, a polynomial
of the 1st degree is used, i.e. 𝑃𝑃1 (𝒙𝒙) = 𝒂𝒂𝑇𝑇 𝒙𝒙.
𝑁𝑁

𝑗𝑗=1

and additional conditions are to be applied:

∑ 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 = 𝟎𝟎

i.e.

ℎ𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓(𝒙𝒙𝑖𝑖 )

It can be seen that for 𝑑𝑑-dimensional case a system of (𝑁𝑁 + 𝑑𝑑 + 1) LSE has to be solved, where 𝑁𝑁
is a number of points in the dataset and 𝑑𝑑 is the dimensionality of data. For N points given and 𝑑𝑑 = 2,
𝑇𝑇
i.e. 𝒂𝒂 = [𝑎𝑎𝑥𝑥 , 𝑎𝑎𝑦𝑦 : 𝑎𝑎0 ] , a system of (𝑁𝑁 + 3) linear equations has to be solved. If “global” functions, e.g.
TPS (𝜑𝜑(𝑟𝑟) = 𝑟𝑟 2 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟, are used, then the matrix 𝑩𝑩 is “full”, if “local” functions (Compactly Supported
RBF – CSRBF) are used, the matrix 𝑩𝑩 can be sparse.
The RBF interpolation was originally introduced by multiquadric method in 1971 [5], which was
called Radial Basis Function (RBF) method. Since then many different RFB interpolation schemes have
been developed with some specific properties, e.g. Thin-Plate Spline (TPS uses 𝜑𝜑(𝑟𝑟) = 𝑟𝑟 2 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟) [4],
2
a function 𝜑𝜑(𝑟𝑟) = 𝑒𝑒 −(𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖) was proposed in [22] and CSRBFs were introduced in [21] as:
(1 − 𝑟𝑟)𝑞𝑞 𝑃𝑃(𝑟𝑟), 0 ≤ 𝑟𝑟 ≤ 1
,
𝜑𝜑(𝑟𝑟) = {
0, 𝑟𝑟 > 1
where: 𝑃𝑃(𝑟𝑟) is a polynomial function and 𝑞𝑞 is a parameter. Theoretical problems with numerical
stability were solved in [4]. The CSRBFs are defined for the “normalized” interval 𝑟𝑟 ∈ 〈0, 1〉, but for
the practical use a scaling is used, i.e. the value 𝑟𝑟 is multiplied by a scaling factor 𝛼𝛼 > 0 (shape
parameter).
Meshless techniques are used in engineering problem solutions, e.g. partial differential equations
(PDE) [6] surface modeling [8], surface reconstruction of scanned objects [3], [18] reconstruction of
corrupted images [22], etc. More generally, meshless object representation is based on specific
interpolation techniques [1][2][6][19][22]. In addition, subdivision or hierarchical methods are used to
decrease sizes of computations and increase robustness [14][20]. If “global” RBF functions are
considered, the RBF matrix is full and in the case of 106 of points, the RBF matrix is of the size
approx.106 × 106 ! On the other hand, if CSRBF used, the relevant matrix is sparse and computational
and memory requirements can be decreased significantly using special data structures.

3 Decomposition of RBF Interpolation
The RBF interpolation can be described in the matrix form as
𝑨𝑨 𝑷𝑷 𝝀𝝀
𝒇𝒇
𝒂𝒂𝑇𝑇 𝒙𝒙𝒊𝒊 = 𝑎𝑎𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 + 𝑎𝑎𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 + 𝑎𝑎0

𝟎𝟎
where 𝒙𝒙 = [𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦: 1]𝑇𝑇 , the matrix 𝑨𝑨 is symmetrical and semidefinite positive (or strictly positive) definite.
Let us consider the Schur’s complement (validity of all operation is expected)

where 𝑴𝑴/𝑨𝑨 is the Schur’s complement. Then the inversion matrix 𝑴𝑴−1

𝑴𝑴−1 = [ 𝑰𝑰 −𝑨𝑨 𝑩𝑩] [
(𝑴𝑴/𝑨𝑨)−𝟏𝟏 −𝑪𝑪𝑪𝑪−1 𝑰𝑰
𝟎𝟎
𝟎𝟎
𝑰𝑰
Now, the Schur’s complement can be applied to the RBF interpolation. As the matrix 𝑴𝑴 is nonsingular,
inversion of the matrix 𝑴𝑴 can be used. Using the Schur’s complement (as the matrix 𝑫𝑫 = 𝟎𝟎)
−1
𝑨𝑨−1

𝑴𝑴−1 = [ 𝑰𝑰 −𝑨𝑨 𝑷𝑷] [

(𝑴𝑴/𝑨𝑨)−𝟏𝟏 −𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 𝑨𝑨−1 𝑰𝑰
𝟎𝟎
𝟎𝟎
𝑰𝑰
Then det(𝑴𝑴) ≠ 0, det(𝑨𝑨) ≠ 0 and det(𝑴𝑴/𝑨𝑨) ≠ 0 as the matrices are nonsingular.
However, if RBF interpolation is used for larger data sets, there is a severe problem with robustness
and numerical stability, i.e. numerical computability issues. Using the Schur’s complement we obtain

Properties of the matrix 𝑨𝑨 are determined by the RFB function used. The value of det(𝑨𝑨) depends also
on the mutual distribution of points. However, the influence of det(𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 𝑨𝑨−1 𝑷𝑷) is also significant as the
value depends on the points mutual distribution due to the matrix 𝑨𝑨 but also to points distribution in
space, due to the matrix 𝑷𝑷. It means that translation of points in space does have significant influence.
Let us imagine for a simplicity that the matrix 𝑨𝑨 = 𝑰𝑰 (it can happen if CSRBF is used and only one point
is within the radius 𝑟𝑟 = 1). Then the distance of a point from the origin has actually quadratic influence,
if a polynomial 𝑃𝑃1 (𝒙𝒙) is used, as the point’s position is in the matrices 𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 and 𝑷𝑷. There is a direct
significant consequence for the RBF interpolation.
𝑁𝑁

𝑓𝑓(𝒙𝒙) = ∑ 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝜑𝜑(‖𝑥𝑥 − 𝒙𝒙𝑗𝑗 ‖) + 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 (𝒙𝒙)

when the 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 (𝒙𝒙), 𝑘𝑘 = 1, 2 is a polynomial
, resp.
𝑃𝑃1 (𝒙𝒙) = 𝑎𝑎0 + 𝑎𝑎1 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝑦𝑦
𝑃𝑃2 (𝒙𝒙) = 𝑎𝑎0 + 𝑎𝑎1 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝑦𝑦 + 𝑎𝑎3 𝑥𝑥 2 + 𝑎𝑎4 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + 𝑎𝑎5 𝑦𝑦 2
𝑇𝑇
In the case of 𝑨𝑨 = 𝑰𝑰, we get a matrix 𝑷𝑷 𝑷𝑷 of the size (3 × 3) and det(𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 𝑷𝑷) in the case of a linear
polynomial 𝑃𝑃1 (𝒙𝒙) as:
𝑁𝑁

𝑁𝑁
∑ 1

∑

It means that points distribution in space and their distances from the origin play a significant role as
2
𝑁𝑁

the det(𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 𝑷𝑷) contains elements ∑𝑁𝑁
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 and ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 in multiplicative etc. in the linear polynomial case.
If a quadratic polynomial 𝑃𝑃2 (𝒙𝒙) is used, the matrix 𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 𝑷𝑷 is of the size (6 × 6) and det(𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇 𝑷𝑷) contains
4
𝑁𝑁
2
𝑁𝑁
elements ∑𝑁𝑁
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,…, ∑𝑖𝑖=1 1 in multiplicative, which brings even worst situation as the
𝑇𝑇
matrix 𝑷𝑷 𝑷𝑷 contains small and very high values.
As a direct consequence, eigenvalues will have large span and therefore the linear system of equations
will become extremely ill-conditioned.

4 Conclusion
The RBF interpolation using compactly supported RBF (CSRBF) have several significant advantages
over methods based on smooth interpolation made on triangulated space area. In this contribution, some
properties of the CSRBF interpolation methods have been presented from “engineering” point of view
and selected features related to robustness and stability of computation have been presented. The
presented founding are fundamental especially in the case of engineering applications. In future, CSRBF
analysis of sparse data structures used, space subdivision and speed up of computation will be explored
more deeply especially for RBF based approximations.
