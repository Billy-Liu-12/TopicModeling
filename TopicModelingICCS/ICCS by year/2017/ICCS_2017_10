This work aims to detail a framework for analysis and visualization of provenance data, in
order to i) simplify the understanding of data provenance; ii) improving the reliability of related
experiments; iii) get a better reuse of data provenance and iv) improve the cooperation among
research groups.
In a recent work, a tool called Prov Viewer [18] was presented. This tool presents the graph
with different layouts to aid the user comprehension. In addition, it seeks to highlight the most
important nodes with techniques for reducing the graph. The advantage of the Visionary framework is to allow the user to create relationships between the nodes of the graph. Techniques are
also used in our work to highlight the most important nodes, but these do not change the initial
structure of the graph and are used in conjunction with visualization techniques. In another
work a provenance visualization approach called AVOCADO [25] generates a visualization based
on the data flow. A heuristic was developed by the authors to calculate the node interest, based
on its attributes. The level of interest as well as the hierarchical structure is used to generate
clusters, and assist in visualization. Visionary’s focus is to perform a prior analysis of the data
before presenting it visually to the user. This analysis offers more resources for the exploration
of the graph and generates new information and inferences that were not previously presented.
In addition, the Visionary analysis technique is domain-free, unlike AVOCADO technique.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents techniques and concepts used in the
research as a background information. Section 3 details the provenance graph analysis. Section
4 presents the framework.

Background and Related Works

Digital provenance is the documentation of the lifecycle processes of digital objects. Usually
the digital provenance describes the responsibility of agents over the administration of digital
objects. Moreover, important events occurring throughout the life cycle of a digital object and
other information associated with the creation, management and preservation of digital objects
is presented [13].
Buneman et al. [5] were one of the first authors to use the concept of digital provenance
in scientific experimentation. Lately, Lim et al. [20] discussed the types of provenance, named
retrospective or prospective. Retrospective provenance models past execution of computational
tasks. It focuses on data transformation during the tasks execution. Otherwise, prospective
provenance models the computational tasks, like a recipe for future data derivation.
Currently the research in this area is intense [3, 6, 14, 17, 18, 25] and the use of standardized
models like OPM [22] and PROV [12] is an important requirement. These models have emerged
from scientific events related to the data provenance, like the Provenance Challenges [21], as is
the case with OPM and from standardization organizations on the Web, i. e., W3C, as is the
case of PROV.
OPM (Open Provenance Model) was developed with the purpose of creating an interoperable
model between systems. PROV model has the objective of enabling interoperability and the
work in heterogeneous environments. PROV defines provenance as being the information about
entities, activities and people involved in the production of a data or thing, which can be used
to evaluate its quality and reliability [12].
PROV defines the use and production of entities by activities that are influenced by agents.
An entity is a digital, physical or conceptual object with fixed aspects. Activity is something
that occurs over a period of time and acts upon entities. An agent is something that has some
kind of responsibility about an activity, about the existence of an entity or another agent [12].
Seven basic relations are modeled in the PROV. These relationships are directed links and have

a fixed element type at each end. All relations have intuitive names, such as: WasDerivedFrom, Used, WasInformedBy, WasGeneratedBy, WasAttributedTo, WasAssociatedWith and
ActedOnBehalfOf [12].
PROV model has an ontology called PROV-O. This ontology defines a coding of the PROV
data model for the OWL2 Web Ontology Language [19]. From PROV ontology, data is modeled
as a directed graph. This graph is used in this work for different analyzes and visualization
generation, from the use of concepts related to complex networks and ontologies.
Classification is one of the most intrinsic activities of human beings used to facilitate the
handling and organization of the huge amount of information that we receive every day. This
classification is performed in order to cluster similar elements, with respect to common attributes. Due to the importance of the classification, it is fundamental to develop methods
capable of performing this task automatically [7]. Complex networks can be used in this context. It is a new area of science inspired by empirical data. Researchers, which are interested in
this area, develop models for complex systems whose structure can evolve. Dynamical systems,
such as epidemic spreading and synchronization, are also taken into account by this theory. In
data clustering, network and graph have the same meaning [7]. Considering data provenance
as a graph that can be analyzed, we can use complex networks concepts in order to classify
and cluster provenance information, enabling a better understanding. However, considering
the use of provenance models and its associated ontologies, we can also provide rules and inference mechanism that can bring new information beyond those explicitly provided by stored
provenance data, improving the data comprehension.
Therefore, in this work we use ontologies and inference rules, together with complex networks
analyses, to generate new knowledge about provenance data. The use of an OWL provenance
data codification enables the use of complex networks analyses together with ontologies inference rules. Complex network analysis techniques are applied to assist the analysis of each
node, giving detailed information to improve the visualization interface. Ontologies bring new
provenance data and relationships. User interaction, with this improved provenance data, is
done through interactive interface that assists the data visualization. It also uses resources to
highlight important information generated by the different analyzes.
A systematic literature review was conducted to identify works that deal with provenance
data visualization. The review selected 13 papers and the most significant are described in
this section. The InProv tool [3] presents the provenance graph with a radial layout, called
ring. This work focuses on the exploration of provenance data offering many features for user
navigation. InProv does not generate new knowledge about the data, unlike the Visionary
framework that analyzes the graph and displays the results with the visualization aid. The
tool created by Chen et al. [6] generates a visualization for user exploration. The focus of this
proposal is to work with large provenance graphs and process data in real time. It uses data
mining techniques and statistics to reduce the graph presented. In the Visionary framework, the
provenance graph is not changed and some simple techniques are used to reduce the displayed
data. In our proposal, analysis is presented to the user, which has the final choice using the
result. Visionary seeks to generate inferences on the data, unlike the work presented. The
PROV-O-VIZ [14] is a viewer compatible with the PROV model. This viewer uses Sankey
diagram layout, focusing on activities within the data flow. This proposal also uses the PROVO to analyze the provenance data. Visionary works with the three node types and generates
analysis on all of them, unlike the PROV-O-VIZ that focuses on the activities. The proposal
of Karsai et al. [17] is a viewer, also compatible with the PROV model. But this proposal
focuses on the grouping of the graph and the automatic generation of names for the groups.
This proposal does not attempt to generate new information or inferences upon the data as the

Provenance Graph Analysis

It is possible to extract provenance graph characteristics, generated by the PROV model, to
describe its structure. This description can be used to identify similarities between nodes and
the influence range of a node. These characteristics are presented by Ebden et al. [9], aimed
to analyze the evolution of provenance graphs. Some of these characteristics are common
metrics used for network analysis, such as diameter or number of nodes. Additional metrics are
adaptations to provenance graphs and their particularities.
Four different metrics were selected by Huynh et al. [15] when analyzing provenance subgraphs. The metrics were used successfully by the authors inferring the quality of each node
analyzed. The metrics are (i) number of nodes, (ii) number of edges, (iii) diameter and (iv)
maximum finite distance (MFD) [9].
Considering the provenance graph as a directed graph G = (V, E), where V and E are nodes
and edge sets respectively, the number of nodes is represented by |V |, and the number of edges
by |E|. The diameter of the graph is the largest distance found within the graph, where distance
is the smallest path between two nodes. After defining the smallest path among all node pairs,
the largest of these values is considered the diameter of the graph. Since provenance graphs
are directed graphs, even in related graphs it is possible to find infinite distances. Therefore,
in determining the distances, the graph is considered temporarily as non-directed.
The MFD is a specific metric for provenance graphs and is defined as the largest finite
distance from one node type to another within a directed graph G. Considering the three node
types present in PROV, we have nine MFDs to be calculated, reaching a total of 12 metrics.
All metrics are used to characterize parts of the provenance graph. The graph is divided
into several subgraphs related to each node, and through its characteristics, it is possible to
relate the subgraphs generated and consequently the related nodes. This is a context-free form
that allows a graph and nodes analysis without the need for adjustments to suit the specificities
of each scientific research.
Each edge of a PROV graph represents forms of influence between the source node and the
destination node [23]. In other words, if there is a path between v0 and vi , noted as v0 → ∗vi , vi
was potentially influenced by v0 . In this way we can construct a sub graph of DG,a dependency,
in which contains only vertices that influence a certain node, as defined in [15]:
DG,a = (VG,a , EG,a )

(1)

VG,a = {v ∈ V : v → ∗a}

(2)

EG,a = {e ∈ E : (∃ vs , vt ∈ VG,a )(e = (vs , vt ))}

(3)

The scientist identifying an element or process that has a prominence, if positive or negative,
the analysis of the DG,a graph from the node a, allows the scientist to create links between
similar nodes. As an example, to understand the importance of such analysis, we can say that
by identifying an element or process in the experiment subject to an error, this analysis allows
to find nodes that represent the same types of elements or processes that may have the same
error due to the similarity of the dependency graph. The same can happen with elements
of high quality, finding similar elements, the scientist can increase the importance of these
elements in the experiment consequently increasing the importance of the respective nodes in
the provenance graph.

With the same principle of the DG,a sub graph, we can determine an IG,a sub graph. IG,a
contains only the nodes that were potentially influenced by a given node a. Thus, we can
determine the importance of the node a within the graph G. We define IG,a as follows:
IG,a = (VG,a , EG,a )

(4)

VG,a = {v ∈ V : a → ∗v}

(5)

EG,a = {e ∈ E : (∃ vs , vt ∈ VG,a )(e = (vs , vt ))}

(6)

To assist scientists in understanding the experiment, the subgraph analysis is highlighted in
the visualization. As the IG,a graph from node a, shows its network of influence, the scientist can
identify in the network the impact of excluding or modifying the element or process represented
by that node. An option in the view allows you to highlight the nodes (changing their size)
according to the influence that it has in the network. This enables the scientist to quickly
identify the most influential nodes in the network and make decisions, if necessary.
The application of these analyzes varies according to the experiment. Thus, while in an
experiment the scientist may seek to increase the influence of a node on the graph for better
results, in another experiment the scientist may seek to decrease the influence of the nodes on
the graph, leaving the graph with fewer connections to also obtain a better result. In this way,
the framework and its resources can improve the experiment comprehension, which enables a
better reuse, cooperation among partners and reliability. However, it does not replace the role
of the scientist who should conduct the analysis and make the final decision.

Visionary Framework

Visionary is a framework created to aid in the diagnosis and understanding of provenance data.
An initial prototype of the framework was developed in Java, being fully compatible with the
PROV model and is available at https://github.com/pgcc/plscience-ecos.git.
E-SECO (e-Science Software ECOsystem) platform [10] is a web-based software ecosystem
designed to support researchers’ activities during the overall scientific workflow life cycle [2].
The key modules of this platform have already been developed and evaluated in e-Science domain, and are illustrated in Figure 1. E-SECO Development Environment” is a web component
where E-SECO code is available, as open source. As a result, the developer community can
contribute through software maintenance and evolution. E-SECO platform relies on a Peer-toPeer network (P2P) where different E-SECO nodes can communicate. The ecosystem is made
up of artifacts provided by different nodes situated in different institutions, APIs that help the
scientific workflow development in its different steps and the open source development environment. Moreover, E-SECO platform is a collaborative environment to support the development
and execution of scientific workflows. It also supports the analysis of data provenance during
the modeling and execution of workflows. For this purpose, E-SECO implements a Provenance
Data Module”. In this module, the data related to tasks, inputs values, output and information from experiments is stored and can be analyzed using ontologies and complex networks
algorithms. For space restrictions, E-SECO platform was not discussed in depth. A detailed
presentation of this platform was done by Freitas et al. [10] and Sirqueira et al. [24]. The
Visionary framework is a web service and connects to E-SECO platform using its services.

Framework Steps

In order to analyze and present provenance data, the Visionary framework has five steps: (1)
Data Capture, (2) Ontology Store and Inference, (3) Data Transformation, (4) Data Analysis
and (5) Visualization. Figure 2 illustrates these steps.
1. Data Capture: The capture phase of the provenance data is done in two ways. First, in
the experiment planning, some basic information is registered by the researcher through
the E-SECO interface. This information describes the experiment, researchers and research groups, workflows used in the experiment and their modeling, and Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) associated with each workflow and workflows versions. During the workflow execution phase, data are collected by a web service that
communicates directly with the SWMSs. Through this service, information about the
experiment executions is obtained, such as: start and end time of the execution, input
and output data of each task executed by the workflows and the obtained results. The
captured data storage is carried out using distributed repositories, modeled according

to PROV data model, facilitating its interpretation, and the interoperability with other
systems. At this stage, information about experiment provenance, experiment execution
and the data consumed and produced during the execution is stored. Although it is a
large volume of data, the E-SECO platform can manage this data with the support of a
peer-to-peer network. Each network node has an E-SECO data repository, allowing data
to be stored in a decentralized but uniform way.
2. Ontology Store and Inference: In this step the provenance data is transposed into an
OWL document modeled from the PROV-ONE ontology (Cuervas-Vicenttin et al., 2014).
The main objective of the ProvONE ontology is to capture data from scientific experiments
related to a specific workflow and its derivations and sub workflows. In the ProvONE
ontological model, there is no explicit concern with the distributed nature of the current
scientific experimentation process. Through this model a scientific experiment cannot be
processed in a distributed way, using several workflows, executed in different SWfMS,
besides needing to support the collaboration of the users. To support these new features
an extension of the ProvONE ontology, called Prov-SE-O, was developed which includes
new classes, properties and rules in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language). Thus, it was
possible to model not only the workflows, but also scientific experiment, as well as to
capture important information related to its distributed nature and the need to support
collaboration activities between the different agents. In this phase, the captured data and
those already stored in the database are inserted into the ontology. Through inference
algorithms, implicit knowledge can be derived, such as, experiments and workflows similar

to each other, or derived from each other; SWMS used for the workflows execution (when
they are not explicitly informed); researchers, institutions and research groups involved
or influencing the experiment; workflows or external services used in the experimentation
process; data consumed and generated by the experiment, among others.
3. Data Transformation: The information contained in the ontology is read and modeled
in a different format used by the next steps of Data Analysis and Visualization. This task
just connects two different technologies (OWL and JSON).
4. Data Analysis: Data in a new format is analyzed, the graphs DG,a and IG,a are defined
for each node and the metrics are calculated for each node. This step is an important
part of the framework. The analysis of the subgraph of each node occurs in two ways,
identifying the importance of the node to the graph and the similarity between nodes.
Considering G = (V, E) the graph of provenance and IG,a = (V , E) the graph of influence
generated from node a, where IG,a ⊂ G. The importance of the node is determined by
the subgraph IG,a , the number of nodes |V |, and the number of edges |E|. The greater
|V |, the greater the set of nodes influenced. In the same way, the greater |E|, the more
times the node influences the nodes belonging to |V |, with more edges, more paths can be
draw between two nodes. A metric (7) was created to determine the importance of each
node. The weight of the number of vertices and edges of each subgraph IG,a is weighted
by the total vertices and arrays of the graph. All these metrics determine the importance
of the node in the provenance graph. The importance is a key aspect for the scientist
to focus their attention. A change in a node that influence great part of the graph must
be well planned in a stable version of a workflow, for example. The similarity between
nodes is determined by the metrics, number of nodes |V |, number of edges |E|, diameter
and MFD values, all taken from the dependence subgraph DG,a . Metrics are calculated
and added to each node in the Data Analysis step. Whenever the scientist wants to find
similar nodes for a specific node, the visualization shows in percentages, the similarity of
the metrics with other nodes. Considering that provenance data can be used to achieve
quality and reliability of entities, activities and agents involved [12], previous information
from nodes with high quality and confidence, for example, allows the scientist to find other
nodes with potentially the same characteristics. The same similarity can be found in cases
of nodes with low quality or low reliability. With prior information from untrustworthy
nodes, the scientist can search for similar nodes and look more closely at nodes with more
similarity, rather than looking at all entities, activities, and agents for error.

5. Visualization: At this stage data is arranged visually. Visualization allows user interaction, data detailing and the display of new information, processed by the ontology and
complex networks algorithms whenever requested. It also allows zooming, graph browsing, filtering nodes by type and highlights manipulated objects. Two different symbol
can be used and can be switched by the user. The visualization displays those symbols
presented by PROV [23], and the symbols commonly used in BPMN [16] with an adaptation. Ontology inferences are highlighted in the visualization. All edges with inferred
links are shown in red; with affirmed links are green; with both links are yellow. The click
in an edge presents all the connections that it has and the connected nodes. Nodes also
present more information with the click as type name and their links to the other nodes.
Symbols are used to facilitate the node type identification. Figure 3 presents an example.

Conclusion

This paper presented a framework to assist in analyzing and understanding data provenance,
called Visionary Framework. The framework uses visualization techniques, together with complex network analyzes and ontology inference to highlight new information found and help the
exploration of provenance data. The data are analyzed through complex networks techniques
and provide some metrics to help in node analyzes. Ontologies rules are used to infer new
information and improves provenance comprehension. The framework was used in the E-SECO
scientific ecosystem as a proof of concepts. However, a formal evaluation need to be conducted
in order to validate the proposal. The Visionary Framework is a first step in order to provide more provenance data comprehension and to improve experiment reuse, reliability and
cooperation among research groups.
An initial prototype of the proposal was implemented and used. However, new improvements
must be done, considering Visionary framework use.
