and reflectance signals can be a useful tool in estimating the presence of an abnormal tissue
[9, 10, 14].
Among the thermal models of heat transfer, the most commonly used to estimate the heat
generation caused by the tumor was proposed by Pennes (1948) [12], which allows a good approximation of the heat transfer phenomenon in living tissues. The Pennes equation parameters
are usually considered constant, except for the blood perfusion, which varies according to the
temperature. Consequently, estimating this parameter is a great challenge [2].
Partridge and Wrobel (2009) [11] proposed a technique to aid in the cancer treatment by
hyperthermia using the inverse analysis procedure by combining the Boundary Element Method
(BEM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the solution of the Pennes bioheat tansfer equation. By
means of this coupling, the coefficients that describe the non-linear thermal perfusion properties
of blood could be identified. Using a two-dimensional model, the results found by the authors for
both linear and quadratic approximations were very close to those found by Deng and Liu (2004)
in the direct analysis [3]. However, in other cases, the GA found difficulties in convergence or
the results were not close to the direct analysis. The cases that GA had difficulty were those
in which the temperature practically does not vary in the surface of the skin.
Das and Mishra (2013) [2] focused on the analysis of a tumor in a breast in an attempt
to define its location, size and properties from the temperature profile. It was considered a
2D breast tissue with a tumor. The heat transfer in the breast tissue was modeled using the
Pennes equation and solved via Finite Volume Method (FVM). Using the inverse analysis, the
objective function was minimized by a GA and, as a result, an accurate estimate of the blood
perfusion rate, location, and tumor thickness was obtained when calculated one at a time. When
calculated simultaneously there are acceptable precisions - with the highest absolute error of
4.95 %.
This work is composed of the following specific objectives: (i) estimate the blood perfusion
rate in a cancerous tissue inserted in a healthy tissue by means of a GA; (ii) perform a study
of the genetic algorithm parameters for this type of application.
To achieve these objectives, an inverse analysis procedure was employed by coupling the
Finite Element Method (for the solution of the Pennes equation and the representation of the
heat generation phenomenon caused by the tumor) with a Genetic Algorithm (to minimize the
temperature difference obtained by the perfusion inserted in the numerical method).

Problem Description and Discretization

An inverse analysis procedure was used by combining the FEM and a GA for the solution of
the Pennes bioheat transfer equation to estimate the blood perfusion rate in a cancerous tissue
inserted in a healthy tissue.
The Pennes model represents the energy balance within the biological tissues by describing
the thermal interaction effects between the metabolism and the blood perfusion. The heat
source due to blood perfusion is incorporated into the classical heat conduction equation. Since
the problem here is analyzed on a steady-state and considering a non-temperature dependent
blood perfusion, the Pennes equation can be written as:
∇ · k∇T + ωb ρb cb (Ta − T ) + Q = 0,

(1)

where T , ρ, c e k are the temperature, density, specific heat and thermal conductivity of the
tissue, respectively. Moreover, Q is the metabolic heat generation, cb and ωb are the specific
heat and perfusion rate of the blood, respectively, and Ta is the arterial temperature. The

second term on the right-hand side of the equation is the heat source due to blood perfusion
and it is characterized by the convective heat transfer performed by the blood through the
capillary vascularization in living tissues.
In the Pennes equation all tissue and blood properties can be temperature dependent, but
since the temperature variation in a heat generation process considered here is small, these
properties are assumed to be constant.
The Equation (1) was spatially discretized using the FEM. When Equation (1) is discretized
by the FEM, a system of the form KT = F arises [4].

2.1

Optimization Problem

The implemented GA (in Matlab/GNU Octave) provides the blood perfusion values (GA population) and receives the temperature profile generated due to the perfusions provided. This
profile is then compared to a reference temperature profile. The error generated by the difference of the reference and computed temperatures leads to an objective function defined by

Equation (2). This objective function is minimized by the genetic algorithm, where Ti,N

Genetic Algorithm

The steps of a genetic algorithm, described in this section, were adapted to the problem as
described below.
In the implemented model the individuals are the blood perfusion values. The chromosome
is a binary sequence representing both the blood perfusion of healthy tissue and the cancerous
tissue, where each half of the sequence represents a perfusion value.
The evaluation is performed according to the objective function (Equation (2)), so that
the smaller the error between the estimated profile and the reference profile, the better is the
individual. For the selection, three different methods were implemented in order to evaluate
them for the problem analyzed here, i.e.:
(i) Selection proportional to the evaluation: based on the method presented by Holland
(1975) [6]. As the intent is to minimize the objective function, the probability of selection pi of
each individual i with fitness Ji is given by:
1

pi = nJi

1
k=1 Jk

(3)

(ii) Linear ranking selection: based on proportional selection differing only in relation to how
to calculate the proportion of each individual. Suggested by Baker (1989) [1], one individual is
associated with a probability pi of being selected, i.e.:

1 − +
− i−1
pi =
n n −n
onde i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n} , n− ≥ 0 e n+ + n− = 2
n
n−1

(4)

(iii) Tournament selection: presented by Goldberg and Deb (1991) [5], some individuals are
chosen randomly from the population and the best of them is chosen. This process is repeated
until forming a new population. The value of t (number of individuals that are chosen) is known
as the size of the tournament.
The crossover probability (pc ) was one of the parameters analyzed as well as the size of the
population. The two-point operator was used. After the crossover, the mutation occurs using
the expression proposed by Schaffer et al. (1989) [15]:
pm =

1, 829
n1,073 lg0,4867

(5)

where n is the population size and lg is the chromosome size.
The mutation is applied to the individuals resulting from the crossover. Each bit of the
chromosome is considered with the probability pm of being mutated.
Since most performance evaluation schemes of a GA measure only the suitability of the best
solution among all individuals, the maintenance of the best individual of the generation k in
the generation k + 1 ensures that the best individual of the generation k + 1 is at least equal to
the best individual of the generation k. This is the function of the elitism, which has also been
implemented.
The individuals created in the current generation are inserted in the population and the
adopted stop condition was the number of generations.

Numerical Experiments and Discussion
Problem description and validation of the model

A cancerous tissue included in a healthy tissue is represented by the two dimensional domain
(2D) as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: 2D representation of the problem domain studied. SOURCE: Das e Mishra (2013)
The validation is necessary to verify if the genetic algorithm parameters have been defined
correctly. The studied model was validated comparing its results with results from the literature.
In this way, it was considered the same case studied by Zhang (2008) [16] who adopted the
Lattice Boltzmann method and also by Das and Mishra (2013) [2] who evaluated the case using
the Finite Volume Method (FVM).
Considering the geometry shown in Figure 2, the healthy tissue has dimension L = 5.0 cm.
The bottom surface is isothermal with arterial blood temperature at Ta = 37◦ C. The upper
(skin) surface is exposed to the environment, exchanging heat with it at Tenv = 20◦ C, and the
convective coefficient is h = 20 W/m2 K. The tumor has dimensions x = L/4 and y = L/4,
being located in a position shown in Figure 2. The thermophysical properties considered for both
(healthy and carcinogenic) tissues are: thermal conductivity k = 0.5 W/mK, blood and tissue
densities ρ = ρb = 1052 Kg/m3 and specific heat of blood and tissue c = cb = 3800 J/KgK.
For the healthy tissue the rate of metabolic heat generation is Qm = 400 W/m3 and for the
tumor is Qm = 40000 W/m3 . According to these properties, the blood perfusion rate of healthy
tissue is ωb = 1 x 10−4 and the perfusion rate of cancerous tissue is ωb = 1 x 10−2 .

4.2

Analysis of selection methods

Two different strategies were implemented, one in which the selected parents are allowed to be
the same individual and another where it is forced to select different parents for the crossing.
The population size was set at 500 individuals and the crossover rate at 80%. The chromosome size was set at 24 bits and the mutation rate at pm ≈ 0.05%. The adopted stop condition
was 200 generations. The results can be seen in Table 1.

Table 1: Comparison of selection methods for two different strategies.
The Different parents strategy shows more accurate results, which confirms that this can be
a good strategy. By adopting this strategy, it is clear that there is a greater diversification of
the population, because if an individual is crossed with himself (in the case of the Equal parents
strategy), the result will always be itself. Thus, when the parents are forced to be different
individuals the likelihood of expanding the search space increases.
The results of Table 1 show that the selection method by Tournament was significantly less
accurate than the other methods. This behavior can be explained due to the randomness from
the method in the choice of individuals. In addition, the method does not follow a pattern like
the other selection methods. The other two methods show results with good approximations,
so that the selection by Ranking with different parents reached the best perfusion values.
From the Table 1, it becomes clear the validation of the model implemented here by the
Ranking and Proportional selection methods. Notice that the objective function, which carries
with it numerical errors associated to each node of the mesh surface, presents very small values,
showing a concordance between the estimated values and the actual temperature values.
In general, all the methods present an excellent convergence, which show, once again, that
the implemented GA effectively fulfills the search for an optimal value.

4.3

Population size analysis

Using the method that obtained the best results, selection by Ranking with the Different parents
strategy, other GA parameters were varied in an attempt to find the parameters that best fit
the GA making results accurate. The population size was varied and the crossover rate was
80 %. For mutation rate, it was used the Equation 5 (note that the formula is sensitive to
population size so that it should change for each case). The results can be visualized in Table
2.
As it was possible to obtain the exact blood perfusion values for a population of 500 individuals (section 4.2), the number of individuals was varied in order to reduce the computational
effort (simulation time). It can be seen from Table 2 that the results are not linear with population size and that for the smaller population size the objective function is not considered a
good result.
It is important to note that for small populations the solution is sensitive to the initial

approximation values, which is determined randomly by the algorithm. It happens because
the search space is smaller. The GA finalization criterion for these simulations was also 200
generations, but it was observed in practice that the smaller the population size, the longer
the GA takes to converge. Hence, for populations of 100, 300 and 400 individuals at the end
of 200 generations there was no uniformity of blood perfusion values of the individuals and
the simulation was prolonged up to 250 generations which allowed a greater uniformity of
individuals.
It can be concluded that the number of generations required for the convergence depends
on the population size. The smaller the population, the larger the number of generations for a
complete convergence of the algorithm. For large populations the search space increases, and
consequently the probability of reaching the optimal global. On the other hand, for smaller
populations there is the risk of the algorithm find a local minimum point. In this case, only
the mutation is able to take the algorithm to a global search again, which makes necessary a
large number of generations, because the mutation rate is usually small.
If, on the one hand, the population size decreases intuitively leading to a decrease in the
execution time of the algorithm, on the other hand, the amount of generation required to make
it converge can increase the execution time to values greater than those of large populations. In
addition, the high probability of stagnation in a local minimum point leads the blood perfusion
to values that are far from expected, in other words, the mathematical errors increase. This can
be observed by analyzing the population of 100 individuals, where the blood perfusion value of
the cancerous tissue departs considerably from the expected value. So that, the smaller values
of populations do not become attractive for the type of problem analyzed here.

4.4

Crossover rate analysis

For the crossover analysis it was used a population of 500 individuals, the selection method
by Ranking, mutation rate given by Equation 5 and the crossover rate was varied according to
Table 3.
The tested crossover probabilities were with 250 generations as the finalization criterion. It
is observed that even for a low crossover rate, equivalent to 40% the result was considerably
good, although it was distant from the other rates. A peculiar case was that the same result
was obtained for both a 60% and 80% crossover rates. There are two factors to consider: (i)
a rate of 60% is likely to cross individuals less than 80% and consequently to perform less
computational effort; (ii) it should compare the objective function value over the generations
of both rates, in order to be able to conclude which convergence was reached first.

Table 3: Comparison of the crossover rate with 500 individuals.
In an attempt to conclude which rate would be the most appropriate for the problem, an
analysis was also carried out for the same crossover probabilities, however using 400 individuals
and again 250 generations as the finalization criterion. The results showed that by decreasing
the probability of crossover from 80% to 60% there was an improvement in the results. For
both cases the crossover rate of 80% has led to the convergence with a slightly smaller number
of generations.
Thus, it is clear that a low crossover probability leads to precision loss, but does not indicate
that the higher the crossover rate, the greater the accuracy. This is because the higher the
probability of crossover more quickly new individuals are introduced into the population. On
the other hand, if the probability is very high, individuals with a high level of fitness can be
removed quickly from the population, which represents a loss of good solutions.

4.5

Analysis of the effects caused by the tumor heat generation

According to the best GA parameters determined: selection by Ranking, crossover probability
of 80%, mutation rate determined by Equation 5 and population of 500 individuals, the tissue
temperature distribution generated by this GA can be visualized in Figure 3 in different views.
The figure 3 shows that the tumor region has a rise in temperature, as might be expected,
since the tumor presence tends to raise the temperature in the region. Since the objective
function has a very low value and the perfusions generated by GA are good approximation, the
temperature distribution is true.
In this way, it is also verified from the point of view of heat transfer that the GA implemented
is capable of providing real blood perfusions in order to reproduce correctly the phenomenon.

Conclusions and Future Work

Measuring or estimating the blood perfusion is of great importance for diseases diagnosis, pharmaceutical studies and cancer treatment, since these measurement in an indirect way may
reveal several abnormality attributes of the tissue. In general, it can be stated that the implemented genetic algorithm is able to accurately predict blood perfusion values for healthy
and carcinogenic tissues. It represents an important step in the study of the Pennes bioheat
transfer equation, which is able to describe the heat flux along cancerous tissues present in
healthy tissues. Through the studies, it was verified that the presence of the tumor tends to
raise the temperature in the region and the project proposed here can verify this fact.
Some points still need a more specific study, which will be carried out in the next stages
of this research. This points are listed as: (i) perform a complexity analysis study of the

implemented GA, to show exactly how much can be gained in runtime and memory usage.
It has been noted in practice that some GA parameters are capable of considerably reducing
computational effort, but a deeper study is needed; (ii) making blood perfusion dependent
on temperature to make the model more real from the point of view of heat transfer. This
dependency can be linear or quadratic. Another important step is to perform the discretization
in three dimensions to represent more faithfully the tissues; (iii) introduce into the model the
phenomena generated in tumor treatments, such as hyperthermia and nanoparticle injection.
