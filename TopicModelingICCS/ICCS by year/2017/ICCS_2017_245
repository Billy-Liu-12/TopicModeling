Social Contact Patterns in Stride

Figure 1: UML class diagram of Stride’s most important classes
that take into account heterogeneous social mixing, have already been proposed [5, 7], but only
a few of these, such as FluTE [2] and FRED [3] are publicly available as open-source projects.
In this paper, we present an open-source individual-based model for infectious disease transmission, Stride , which explicitly takes into account age, type of day and context when simulating social contacts. We illustrate our model by presenting a case study for an influenza
epidemic in Miami-Dade, USA.

2.1

Methods
Model

Figure 1 presents an overview of Stride’s classes and associations, the most important of which
we discuss here in more detail.
The central entity of Stride is the individual, represented by a “Person” class and characterized by age, gender and health. A person’s health status is stored in a “Health” class, and
can be susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered or vaccinated/immunized, as Stride is based
on a SEIR compartmental model. The duration of the infectious period, and the time it takes
for a given person to recover, are also stored in this class. These durations are drawn from a
distribution for each individual when the population is initialized at the start of the simulation.
At initiation of the simulator, each individual’s membership to four different “Clusters” (a
household, a school or workplace, and two more general ‘communities’) is read from a configuration file. Each cluster represents the target population that members may contact during
one day, irrespective of the sequence. For each of these cluster-types, a “ContactProfile” exists,
which contains a vector of age-dependent contact frequencies. The actual contact probability
between two members of a cluster can be calculated by dividing this age-dependent number of
contacts by the size of a particular cluster. To reduce the simulator’s memory footprint, one
“MasterProfile” singleton class is used to access all cluster specific “ContactProfile” instances.
The simulator moves forward in discrete time-steps of one day. Each time-step, we start
by updating the health state of infected individuals: we check whether they should become
infectious or recovered based on durations that are unique to each person. Secondly, we decide
whether individuals are present in their clusters, by consulting the type of day in the “Calendar”
class. Thirdly, we simulate social contacts and transmission events between present members
in each cluster. The “ContactHandler” defines a contact and transmission probability, based
on a “ContactProfile” and disease specific settings. The Infector class determines the contact
algorithm depending on whether or not contacts are logged. In the default simulation, the
optimized procedure shown in algorithm 1 is selected by the “Infector”. We first sort the cluster
members on health status so only the contacts between infectious and susceptible people need
be processed [10]. If contacts need to be logged, the social contact behavior of all members

is processed. To increase the portability of the output, the model provides data from a userspecified sample of participants in a virtual social contact survey. The results for social contacts
presented in this paper, are based on a sample of 3000 individuals from the simulated population.

Configuration of Experiments

To illustrate Stride and elaborate on the importance of social contact modeling, we performed
a case study on influenza transmission in Miami-Dade (Florida, USA), comparing three social
contact hypotheses. In the first scenario (“only weekdays”), we included only weekdays with
contacts in household, work, school and community. For the second scenario (“7d average”),
we calculated a weighted average for the contact rates in school and work, based on 5 weekdays
(as described above) and 2 weekend days with only household and community contacts. In the
third scenario (“week/weekend”), we modeled week and weekend days separately.
The population, consisting of 2.45 million people in 867 251 households, 441 schools and 180
772 workplaces, was extracted from the 2010 U.S. Synthetic Population Database (Version 1)
of RTI International [8]. We then added a community layer representing general contacts in the
population by aggregating households, sorted on ID (we assumed that proximity in household
IDs reflects spatial proximity), until a threshold of 2000 people was reached [2]. For households,
we assumed a fully connected network. For the community contacts, we derived a mean number of contacts outside the household, school or workplace during week days and weekend days
from a survey in Flanders [11] since survey data at the population level is not available for the
USA. For schools and workplaces, we also used survey data from Flanders. Age-mixing patterns
were obtained from the observed contacts through thin plate regression spline smoothing. In
the model, people on average become infectious for influenza 2 days after infection and recover
after 6 days (acquiring immunity against future infections). We estimated R0 - the number of
secondary cases an infected individual causes on average - for influenza in the Miami-Dade pop2
).
ulation - through multiple model- realizations as (160.29*Ptransmission - 951.09*Ptransmission
Results presented in this paper were performed with an estimated R 0 of 1.56. Initially, 245
persons in the population were infected.
Each simulation covered 150 days and each experiment was repeated 20 times using the run
index as a seed for the pseudo-random number generator.

Results

We performed simulations for influenza transmission in Miami-Dade (Florida, USA) as described in the previous section. Run times of the simulator are dependent on the total number
of infections but did not take more than 6 minutes.
Figure 2 presents age-mixing patternswithin the Miami-Dade population, based on the “7d
average” social contact rates. Similar patterns are observed for the other scenario’s. Stride
produces social contact patterns that are strongly assortative with age: people are mainly
mixing with people of the same age. Intergenerational mixing is also included in the model,
representing the social contacts between children and (grand)parents.
We observed differences in the peak timing (Figure 3) and the cumulative attack rate for
influenza simulations using the three social contact hypotheses. Although average numbers of
contacts on a weekly basis are similar, different transmission dynamics tend to occur based
on the timing of the contacts. In the “only weekdays” scenario, we noticed a higher attack
rate (0.575), compared the “7d average” scenario (0.447) and the “week/weekend” scenario
(0.422). Also, we observed an early peak with the “7d average” simulations compared to the
other scenarios. The number of daily cases in the “week/weekend” scenario showed an irregular
shape, indicating decreased transmission during weekend days.

Discussion

80

In this paper we presented an individual-based simulator for the transmission of infectious
diseases, focusing on data-driven, age-related social contact patterns. The age-mixing patterns
produced by Stride mimic those found in other studies [4, 6]. We stress the importance of social
mixing patterns in transmission models: the explicit incorporation of weekend days (without
school and work contact) had a clear effect on the peak day and attack rate compared to
weighted average social mixing patterns.

Social Contact Patterns in Stride

2438–2442

In the future, the inclusion of different community contact profiles for weekdays and weekend
days is promising to further examine the effect mixing patterns have on transmission dynamics.
In the model we describe here, social contact rates were dependent on the ages of the individuals involved, the type of day, and the context in which the contacts took place. There are,
however, many other factors that might influence both social contacts and disease transmission:
general policies such as school closures and quarantines, and the behavior of people that can
change dynamically. We expect future research to focus on including adaptive behavior, an
increasing trend in individual-level models [9].
