Dual-mixed finite elements for Jisheng
the three-field
model

Kou and Sun

In the formulation (1), the velocity and pressure are treated as the two primal variables, so
it is called two-field model. The three-field model of Stokes flow introduces the stress tensor as
a new variable except for velocity and pressure. We define the stress tensor

Then (1) can be reformulated as

η −1 τ = ∇u.

(3)

The three-field model has been extensively used in nonlinear Stokes problems [2, 6, 12].
The mixed finite element method is a very popular method for simulating flow problems in
porous media [1,9], Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations [3,4,7]. In particular, a series of research
activities is carried out on simple and efficient nonconforming finite element methods for the
two-field model of Stokes problems, for example, [5, 10, 11]. These mixed methods discretize
the velocity and pressure in different finite element spaces. On the other hand, the dual-mixed
finite element methods for a three-field model of Stokes problems have also been developed, for
example, [2,6,12]. Compared to mixed methods based on two-field model, dual-mixed methods
for a three-field model provide more flexibility in approximating three variables using different
finite element spaces, so they may achieve higher computational accuracy for not only the pair
of velocity and pressure but also the stress.
The relationship between mixed finite element methods and finite difference or finite volume
schemes is an interesting research issue. It has been shown in [1] that the cell-centered finite
difference method for elliptic problems can be derived from the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas
(RT0 ) spaces [13] on rectangles using appropriate quadrature rules. The staggered grid introduced by Harlow and Welch [8] has been used extensively and popularly in computational
fluid mechanics. Finite volume schemes on staggered grid have also been the basis of many
industrial applications. It is shown in [7] that the MAC method can be derived by combining
a velocity-vorticity mixed finite element method with an adequate quadrature formula.
In this paper, we will first construct a three-field weak formulation for Stokes problems,
and from this, a new dual-mixed finite element method is proposed. We discretize the velocity
in the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas space and the pressure with piecewise constant functions,
respectively. The components of stress tensor are approximated by piecewise constant functions
or Q1 functions. Applying trapezoid quadrature rules to our proposed scheme, we derive a finite
volume method on staggered grid, which is extensively used in computational fluid mechanics
and engineering.

Finite volume method on staggered grid

We now formulate a finite volume method on staggered grid, which is one of the most common
methods for simulating Stokes equations in practical applications. For sake of simplification,
we focus on the case of rectangular domain, but the proposed scheme can be extended to the
other regular domains. Moreover, the viscosity is assumed to be a constant.
We consider a rectangular domain Ω = [0, Lx ] × [0, Ly ]. For sake of simplification, we use a
uniform rectangular mesh for the domain, and denote the mesh size by h. The interval [0, Lx ]
is uniformly divided into M subintervals, while the interval [0, Ly ] is uniformly divided into
N subintervals. The variables located on the vertexes of each element are denoted by integer
subscripts or superscripts, while variables on the middle points of an edge or element are denoted

the pressure is located at its center (denoted by pi+ 12 ,j+ 12 ), the velocity component u is located

The discrete forms on the boundary elements can be similarly obtained by substituting the
boundary conditions.

The discrete forms (4) and (5) are obtained substituting (37) and (38) into the equations (50)
and (51). For the equation (∇ · uh , w) = 0, let w = 1 on an element K, we get (6).
We note that the above derivations are carried out on the interior elements, but the boundary
elements can be handled by the similar approaches and taking into account the boundary
conditions.

Numerical results

We test the benchmark driven cavity problem. For Ω = [0, 1]2 , we have that uB = [1, 0]T on
the top boundary (that is, the portion of the boundary satisfying 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and y = 1) and
uB = 0 on the rest portions of the boundary. The source term is zero. The viscosity is set as
η = 1. Figs. 1 shows the computed flow quiver on a rectangular mesh composed of 30 × 30
square elements.

Conclusions

A new weak formulation is developed for the three-field model of Stokes problems. Based on
this formulation, we proposed a dual-mixed finite element method on a rectangular mesh. A
finite volume method on staggered grid is derived by applying trapezoid quadrature rules for
the proposed scheme.
