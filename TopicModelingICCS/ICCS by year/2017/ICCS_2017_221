[1, 21]. An accurate and cost-effective scheme can be obtained by employing a weighted average
of these methods [24]. In particular, Ainsworth has shown that the optimal blending of FEM
and SEM provides two orders of extra accuracy in the phase error [1, 2].
Herein, we describe the errors in the discrete approximations to elliptic eigenvalue problems
for the normal modes and frequencies of free structural vibrations. A similar analysis can be
applied to the Helmholtz equation (e.g., frequency domain wave propagation). We consider
both the eigenvalue and eigenfunction errors. That is, we conduct a global error analysis by
describing the errors in the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions for all modes. The sum of the
eigenvalue error and the square of the L2 eigenfunction error equals the square of the error in
the energy norm. To quantify the approximation errors for the case underintegration, we have
generalized Strang’s Pythagorean theorem to include the effect of inexact integration [10, 28].

Problem statement

We first analyse the Laplace eigenvalue problem in one dimension
∂2u
= λu, for x ∈ Ω =]0, 1[
∂x2
u(0) = u(1) = 0,

(1)

with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The following standard results are specialized
for the one-dimensional case to simplify the discussion [10, 22, 28, 30]. The problem has a
countable infinite set of eigenvalues λj ∈ R and an associated set of orthonormal eigenfunctions
uj (normalized with respect to the L2 inner product)
0 ≤ λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λj ≤ ...

uj (x)uk (x)dx = δjk ,
(uj , uk ) =

(2)
(3)

Ω

where δjk is the Kronecker delta which is equal to 1 when i = j and 0 otherwise. These
eigenfunctions form an L2 -orthonormal basis and are orthogonal also in the energy inner product
(Luj , uk ) = (λj uj , uk ) = λj δjk .

(4)

The standard weak form for the eigenvalue problem is stated as follows: Find all eigenvalues
λj ∈ R and eigenfunctions uj ∈ V such that, for all w ∈ V ,
a(w, uj ) = λj (w, uj ),

(5)



(6)

where
a(w, uj ) =

and V is a closed subspace of H 1 (Ω). We use the notation of [30] where (·, ·) and a(·, ·) are
symmetric bilinear forms which define the following inner products

The Galerkin formulation of the eigenvalue problem is the discrete form of (5): Find the
discrete eigenvalues λhj ∈ R and eigenfunctions uhj ∈ V h ⊂ V such that, for all wh ∈ V h ⊂ V ,
a(wh , uhj ) = λhj (wh , uhj ).

(9)

Because of the minimax principle, all discrete eigenvalues resulting from the finite element
method approximate from above the exact eigenvalues
λhj ≥ λj

for all j.

(10)

The theorem for the Pythagorean eigenvalue error can be applied in this case [10, 21, 28, 30].
For each discrete mode, the eigenvalue error and the product of the eigenvalue and the square
of the eigenfunction error in the L2 -norm sum to the square of the error in the energy norm
2

λhj − λj + λj uhj − uj  = uhj − uj E .

(11)

The original eigenvalue problem (1) can be written in matrix form as
Kφj = λj Mφj

(12)

where

with φi (x) piecewise polynomial basis functions. M and K are symmetric positive definite
banded matrices with the maximum bandwidth equal to p.
We first introduce notation to analyze the effects of quadrature for finite elements, spectral
elements, and isogeometric analysis. The integrals in the elemental matrices (13) are evaluated
with the help of numerical integration rules. An m-point quadrature rule requires m evaluations
of a function f (x) to approximate its weighted integral over an interval [a, b]


b

w(x)f (x)dx =

m


wi f (xi ) + Rm .

(14)

i=1

Here wi and xi are the weights and the nodes of the rule, respectively. The quadrature rule is exact for a given function f (x) when the remainder Rm is exactly zero. For example, the standard
m-point Gauss-Legendre (GL or Gauss) quadrature is exact for the linear space of polynomials
of degree at most 2m − 1. The quadrature rule employed in the numerical scheme strongly
affects the matrix formation and assembly procedures, and, in turn, the overall efficiency of
Galerkin-type numerical methods. Further details can be found in [3–6, 10, 23, 28].
Element-level integrals may be approximated using other quadrature rules, for example the
Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL or Lobatto) quadrature rule that is used in the spectral element
method (SEM). The Lobatto quadrature evaluated at m nodes is accurate for polynomials up
to degree 2m − 3. However, selecting a rule with p + 1 evaluations for a polynomial of order
p and collocating the Lagrange nodes with the quadrature positions renders the mass matrix
diagonal in 1D, 2D and 3D for arbitrary geometrical mappings.

Pythagorean eigenvalue theorem and quadrature errors

In this section we state a generalized Pythagorean eigenvalue error theorem that accounts for
modified inner products. We write the approximate solutions for the fully-integrated and the
modified inner-product discretizations, respectively, as
a(uhj , uhj ) = λhj (uhj , uhj ),

(15)

ah (vjh , vjh ) = µhj (vjh , vjh )h .

(16)

Here ah (·, ·) and (·, ·)h are the discrete inner products represented by the chosen quadratures.
For each j, the set vjh and µhj are the discrete eigenpair resulting from these discrete inner
product representations. The corresponding eigenfunctions are orthonormal with respect to
the appropriate inner product
(ui , uj ) = (uhi , uhj ) = (vih , vjh )h = δij .

(17)

In the modified inner product case we can write the generalized Pythagorean theorem as
follows




uj − vjh 2 = λj 1 − 2(uj , vjh ) + 1 + a(vjh , vjh ) − λj ,

which can be reduced to the following form [28]

Quadrature blendings for finite elements and isogeometic analysis

The blending of the spectral and finite element methods to achieve an improvement of two orders
of accuracy was studied by several authors [2, 24]. This method blends the Gauss quadrature
rule, which exactly integrates the bilinear forms to produce the mass and stiffness matrices,
with the Lobatto quadrature, which underintegrates them. Ainsworth and Wajid [2] selected
the blending parameter to maximize the order of accuracy in the phase error. They proved
that the optimal choice for the blending parameter is given by weighting the spectral element
and the finite element methods in the ratio p to one scaled by (p + 1).
Alternative blendings can lead to much smaller errors in the mid range of the spectrum than
the optimal blending. However, only the optimally blended scheme has two additional orders of
convergence when compared against the FEM, SEM, or another blending of these two methods.
In practice, the blended scheme does not require the assembly of the mass matrices for both
schemes and can be realized by simply replacing the standard Gaussian quadrature rule by
an alternative one that has the same (or even less) number of quadrature points. Hence, no
additional computational cost compared to the Gaussian rule is required. However, the mass
matrix in the blended scheme is no longer diagonal like in the case of the SEM. Similar optimal
blendings for isogeometric analysis are presented in [10, 28].

Numerical examples

Herein, we focus on the one-dimensional problems described in Section 2. The mesh is uniform
unless otherwise specified.
The exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the 1D problem are
√
λj = j 2 π 2 and uj = 2 sin(jπx), j = 1, 2, ..., respectively. The approximate eigenvalues λhj are
sorted in ascending order and are compared to the corresponding exact counterparts.

Figure 1: Illustration of the generalized Pythagorean eigenvalue theorem. The optimally
blended C 1 quadratic elements are compared with the standard C 1 quadratics.
µh −λj

In the following figures, we present the relative eigenvalue (EV) errors jλj , the L2 -norm
2

eigenfunction (EF) errors uj − vjh 0 and, occasionally, the relative energy norm EF errors
2
uj −vjh E
. This format of error representation clearly illustrates the budget of the generalized
λj
Pythagorean eigenvalue theorem (20). Thus, Figure 1 shows the eigenvalue and eigenfunction
errors of optimally blended C 1 quadratic elements versus the standard fully-integrated scheme.
The optimal scheme allows for a much better approximation of the discrete eigenvalues. The
eigenfunctions are either improved a bit, like in this case, or not affected (in higher-order
schemes).
Figure 2 illustrates the convergence of the optimally blended C p−1 discretization with cubic,
quartic and quintic elements. Their blending parameters are explained in [10] and are 52 , 84
5 ,
and 175, respectively.
Figure 3 shows the eigenvalue and eigenfunction errors for cubic elements with different
continuity of the basis functions. The quadrature for this scheme was obtained by using τ = 3/4
as a blending parameter. While this value leads to the optimal scheme for C 0 elements, it does
not provide two additional convergence orders for cubic elements of higher continuity.
The optimally blended C 0 elements (τ = p/(p+1)) were presented in [2]. We have found that
this blending is optimal also for even-order C 1 elements. Figure 4 shows the approximation
errors of quartic, quintic and sextic C 1 elements. The τ = p/(p + 1) scheme is optimal for
quartic and sextic elements, but not for the quintic ones. The same behavior is observed for
higher-order schemes.

that are typical for the finite-element case: the large spike in the center and large errors in the
optical branch. The optimally blended scheme allows to increase the quality of approximation

The spectra for a similar mesh but with a 1:100 ratio of the elements are shown in Figure
6. The basis functions for in this case are similar to the C 0 (finite-element) basis on a uniform
mesh. The approximation errors are almost identical in these cases, even though the schemes
have different continuity of the basis. The presence of spikes in eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is
related to how many different types of basis functions are present, rather than to the continuity
of the basis.

Conclusions

Using optimally blended quadrature rules we increase the accuracy and robustness of the isogeometric methods. We analyze the dispersion profile of the methods and show that modified
inner products can be obtained by generalizing the ideas introduced by Ainsworth and Wajid
to the highly-continuous isogeometric discretizations. The new blending schemes for smoother
basis functions improve the accuracy of the approximation of the eigenvalues and, in some cases,
the eigenfunctions. The optimally blended isogeometric elements are superconvergent by two
orders when compared to the standard fully integrated methods.
