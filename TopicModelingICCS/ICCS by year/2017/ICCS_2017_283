facet of the affine hull and hence, implicitly incorporate structural information of the sets as
well. Fan and Yeung [1] use hierarchical clustering to discover local structures, approximate
each local structure with a linear (not affine) subspace, quantify similarities between subspaces
using canonical angles, and finally measusre similarities between face image sets by combining
these local similarities using majority voting. Wang et al. [2] presents Manifold Discriminant
Analysis (MDA) to solve the problem of image set classification. By modeling each image set as
a manifold, MDA seeks to learn an embedding space, where manifolds with different class labels
are better separated, and local data compactness within each manifold is enhanced. Zhang et
al. [3] proposed a method which uses the regularized least square model to recognize the face
images which are processed by the collaborative representation based classification (CRC).
Recently, Tang et al. [5] use Deep Learning method which could achieve 99.47% face verification accuracy on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), higher than human performance. The
Deep Learning based method gets excellent performance in pattern recognition. However, the
Deep Learning method is not suitable for video based face recognition because of the nearly
real-time processing speed acquirement.
While image-set based face recognition provides an opportunity for face recognition in video,
it also poses many challenges on the other side. The main challenge is how to model an imageset efficiently which could represent the face of one person in a compact pattern without losing
the discriminative information of the face.
Based on the image-set based object classification methods, we present a multi-scale imageset based collaborative representation method optimized margin distribution for face recognition. We use collaborative representation method to get the outputs of different sizes of sub
image sets and then obtain the final result by optimally combining these outputs.

Multi-scale Collaborative Representation

Our method is inspired by CRC which is proposed by Zhang et al. [3]. The solution of CRC
[3] is using regularized least square method to transform y to be â firstly.
â = (X T X + λ · I)−1 X T y

(1)

where λ is the regularization parameter, subjects X = [X1 , X2 , ..., Xc ] have c classes, and
the query sample is y. Secondly, the classification of CRC [3] is performed by checking the
minimal regularized reconstruction error.
rk =

||y − Xk âk ||
, â = [â1 ; â2 ; ...; âc ]
||âk ||2

(2)

The recognition result of the query sample y is the arg min k{rk } in the end.
Indentity(y) = arg min k{rk }

(3)

When the linear system is determined by the dictionary X which is under-determined, the
linear representation of the query sample over X can be very accurate while regularization result
â is necessary for a unique and stable solution [6]. Therefore, once the available samples per
subject are very limited, CRC [3] may fail because the linear representation of the query sample
y is not accurate. In order to alleviate the problem of sample lack, we proposed a multi-scale
image-set based on CRC [3] method.
The proposed ensemble scale weights learning algorithm for MSCRC is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Firstly, the query image set y is divided into many sub sets {y1 , y2 , ..., yq } to improve the
robust of CRC [3]. The size of the sub-set is named to be the scale in this paper, the multi-scales
have a great impact on the recognition performance and we give the a scale optimal method
for a database in the final step.
Secondly, a sub set yj is represented by the local dictionary Dj , which is extracted from X
at the corresponding set yj . Dj = [Dj1 , Dj2 , ..., Djc ] is the local dictionary, and each column
Djk is a patch of class k and generated by the sub-dictionary of the k−th class.
ρ̂j = arg min{||yj − Dj ρj ||22 + λ||ρj ||22 }

(4)

Thirdly, non-linear or linear weighted combination can be applied to image set based recognition to generate the final classification outputs because the linear system determined by local
dictionary Mj tends to be under-determined. The recognition output zj of patch yj is
Identity(yj ) = arg min(rjk )

where ρ̂j = [ρ̂j1 , ρ̂j2 , ..., ρ̂jc ] and rjk = j ||ρ̂jk

Finally, based on different scales in various patch sizes, we can get the recognition outputs
by CRC [3]. Then we propose a method which could learn optimal weight w of every sub set
from the training samples by optimizing margin distribution. The optimal weight w of sub-sets
is used to fuse the outputs.
Given a sample xi ∈ S, the recognition outputs of different scales are {hij }, j = 1, 2, ..., m.
The size of the scales is m. The discriminant function of xi under scale {hij } is f =

Ensemble margin reflects the misclassification degree in classifier fusion. Samples with positive margin are correctly classified. +1 and −1 represent the the classification result of elements
in the decision matrix D. We could make the ensemble margin as larger as possible by scale
weight learning. Since margin maximization also could be converted into a loss minimization

After learning the scale weights, for a given query sample xi , the recognition result of xi is

The classification outputs of all patches are fused in the end. The method Majority voting,
linear weighted combination, kernel plurality and probabilistic model all can be employed for
the result fusion. Since the weighted combination leads to little improvement compared with
the simple majority voting. Therefore, we use the majority voting for the final decision.

Experimental Analysis
Dataset Details

Our proposed method is tested on three standard face databases. Adaboost is used to acquire
face region and Camshift is employed for tracking.
YouTube celebrity database includes video clips of 47 celebrities from YouTube. There
are about 1910 video clips in the database. This database is a challenge for face trackers and
recognizers as the videos exhibit large variations in face pose, illumination, occlusion, expression,
and other factors.
The Honda/UCSD Video database includes 20 individuals moving their heads with different
combinations of 2-D and 3-D rotation, expressions and speed.
The CMU MoBo dataset contains 96 video sequences of 25 individuals walking on a treadmill
in the CMU 3D room. The subjects perform four different walk patterns: slow walk, fast walk,
inclined walk and walk with a ball. All subjects are captured by six high resolution color
cameras distributed evenly around the treadmill.

3.2

Comparison against video-based face recognition approaches in
literatures.

To allow comparison with the previous methods, we followed the same protocol as used by [4].
The proposed Multi-scale image-set based CRC method was compared with 3 recent algorithms:
SANP[4], MMD[9] and MDA[2]. The comparison with other state-of-the-art methods is shown
in Tab. 1. The experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform a number of
existing state-of-the-art ones.

Conclusion

In this paper we proposed the MSCRC method. The query image set was partitioned into
subsets and each subset is collaboratively represented over the corresponding subset of all
training samples. The classification outputs of multiple sizes of subsets, which are combined
with the multi-scale outputs, are optimized by margin distribution optimization with 1 -norm
regularization. Our experimental results on controlled and uncontrolled face databases showed
that MSCRC outperforms state-of-the-art image set based methods.
