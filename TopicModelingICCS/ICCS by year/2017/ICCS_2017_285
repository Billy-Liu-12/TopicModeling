[23]. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common among the neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous
system interfering with nerve impulses within the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerves
[2]. Even though the temporal evolution of MS is different for each patient, four disease courses
have been identified in MS: (i ) Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), (ii) Primary Progressive MS
(PPMS), (iii ) Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), and (iv ) Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS)
(the last two being the most common ones) [11]. Approximately 85% of the population affected
by MS is initially diagnosed with RRMS, with an observed increase in patient’s disability produced by clearly defined attacks or neurological symptoms, alternated with recovery phases
which worsen until his total inactivity. The 30-50% of patients affected by RRMS, develop
SPMS within 10 years. SPMS is characterized by a progressive worsening of the neurological
function and a consequent increase of the disability over time.
MS is a degenerative disorder which presents specific symptomatologies, among which speech
impairment (also known as dysarthria) [15]. Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting
from neurological injury due to damages in the central or peripheral nervous system. The
evaluation of dysarthria, by using a noninvasive acoustic analysis of vocal signal, represents
a valid clinical support to the otolaryngologist, neurologist and speech pathologist for early
and differential diagnosis and for documenting the disease progression. Clinical assessment
of dysarthria in patients affected by MS have been studied and reported in literature, with
statistically significant differences with respect to normal subjects [25] [18]. In the last few
years, new acoustic measures of dysarthric speech have been proposed as alternative methods
to more effectively differentiate dysarthric from healthy speech [27] [20]. Authors in [9] propose a
study to determine the extent to which vowel metrics are capable of distinguishing healthy from
dysarthric speech and among different forms of dysarthria, testing the Discriminant Function
Analysis (DFA).
Acoustic analysis has been reported in literature as a tool to evaluate and characterize
vocal pathological signals [24] [1]. Authors in [26] analyze the acoustic parameters commonly
used in applications of acoustic analysis as well as the fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer
and Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR) to define a procedure for automatic diagnosis of larynx
pathologies. Several signal processing algorithms have been implemented to perform vocal
signal analysis with the aim to identify pathological voices in voice datasets [16] [17]. Moreover,
software tools have been produced to extract vocal feature for signal analysis; for example, in
[12] jitter measurements have been evaluated by comparing the results of four tools. Multi
Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP) and PRAAT are the most common tools used for voice
analysis in clinical practice [7] [13]. To better define the results of acoustic analysis algorithms
and tools the vowel metric is often used [19] [22] [6]. To this end, the contribution proposed in
[14] regards relevant data acquisition and analysis methods to define the speech parameters as
the Vowel Space Area (VSA) and the Formant Centralization Ratio (FCR).
All of these contributions highlight significant differences between patients with MS and
normal subjects, justifying the assumption that speech analysis may become a helpful tool
for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease progression. Additionally, sharing data and
information for increasing knowledge can be performed in a distributed laboratory as in [28]
[29] [3].
In this paper, the evaluation of vocal signals in patients with MS has been performed by
using an acoustic analysis and a vowel metric analysis on the acquired samples. In particular:
(i ) the PRAAT tool has been used to execute acoustic analysis, (ii ) a software written in
Matlab has been coded to calculate the vowel metrics and (iii ) statistical analyses have been
performed to evaluate significant results.

Methods

Speech alterations can be studied by analyzing several parameters obtained from vocal signals
with the aim to describe the voice objectively and identify specific patterns. The parameters
extracted to perform the analysis reported in this contribution are described in the following
sections. In particular, two types of methods have been used to extract these parameters to
furnish a more detailed analysis for the evaluation and identification of possible correlations
between vocal signal and MS disease. The two methods are: acoustic vocal analysis (i ) and (ii )
vowel metric analysis. The first extracts the principal acoustic parameters in term of frequency
content; the second, instead, extracts parameters describing the vowel articulation.

2.1

Acoustic Analysis

Vocal signal is produced by the pulsing of the vocal folds that creates a pattern of amplitude
modulation in the waveform and harmonicity in the spectrum. The produced vocal signal is
a complex periodic wave made up of several simple periodic waves. The acoustic analysis of
this signal produces a set of acoustic parameters [31]. Currently, the most common parameters
generally used by physician and referenced in literature are [26]:
• Fundamental frequency (F0 );
• Jitter;
• Shimmer;
• Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR).
Fundamental frequency (F0 ) is a robust feature of the speech signal. It is measured in Hertz
(Hz, cycles per second) and it is defined as the number of times in which a sound wave produced
by vocal cords is repeated during a specific time period [26]. The fundamental frequency is
determined by the rate of modulation of the vocal folds during voiced speech and it decreases
in pathological voices. Vocal fold vibration produces many harmonics above F0 that decrease
in amplitude as the frequency increases. Synthetically, the Pitch is the fundamental frequency
of the vocal cords vibration followed by four/five Formants (F1 , F2 , F3 , F4 , F5 ) at higher
frequencies. The formants are the bands of energy that correspond to the resonances of the
vocal tract for particular shapes.
Jitter and shimmer are measurements of F0 disturbance and they are essential in the description of vocal characteristics. Jitter parameter is defined as the frequency variation of the
sound wave periodically (cycle to cycle) and it is especially affected by the lack of control of
cords vibration. Generally, a pathological voice presents a higher percentage of jitter compared
to healthy voice: a variation between 0.5% and 1% is considered a significant value. Typically,
two types of jitter parameters are considered: absolute and relative [5]. Absolute jitter, JA ,
represents the average absolute difference between two consecutive periods and it is calculated
as:
JA =

N −1
1 
|Ti − Ti+1 |
N − 1 i=1

(1)

Relative jitter, JR , is the average absolute difference between two consecutive periods divided
by the average period and it is evaluated as:

(2)

In both equations, Ti are the extracted F0 period lengths and N is the number of extracted
F0 periods.
Shimmer parameters, instead, is defined as the amplitude variation of the sound wave and
its changes are related to mass lesions on the vocal cords. Shimmer values less than 3% for
adults and around 0.4% and 1% for children are considered in pathological voice. As for jitter,
also for shimmer two types of parameters are evaluated: relative, SR and dB, SdB [5]. The first
is defined as the average absolute difference between the amplitudes of two consecutive periods,
divided by the average amplitude and it is expressed as:
SR =

1
N −1

N −1

i=1 |Ai −
N
1
i=1 Ai
N

Ai+1 |

(3)

The second is the average absolute difference of the base 10 logarithm of the difference
between two consecutive periods multiplied by 20 and it is calculated as:
SdB =

N −1
1 
|20log(Ai+1 /Ai )|
N − 1 i=1

(4)

In both equations, Ai are the extracted peak-to-peak amplitude data and N is the number
of extracted F0 periods.
The Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR) is a measurement of the voice pureness and it is
expressed in decibel (dB) as the ratio between the energy of periodic components (harmonics)
and the energy of non periodic component (noise) in a voice segment [4]. HNR is the mean
amplitude (i.e., energy) of the average wave divided by the mean amplitude of the isolated noise
components and can be calculated as follows:
HN R = 10x log10 (

HarmonicEnergy
)dB
N oiseEnergy

(5)

By using this equation, if 99 of the energy of the signal is in the periodic part, and 1 is noise,
the HNR is 20 dB. A HNR of 0 dB means that there is equal energy in the harmonics and in
the noise. HNR reflects the speech efficiency: an healthy voice is characterized by a high HNR,
instead values less than 7 dB indicate pathological voices.

2.2

Vowel Metric

Speech samples associated with dysarthria are often characterized by vowels centralization due
to undershooting of articulatory targets. The Vowel Space Area (VSA) is an acoustic index
commonly used in clinical research to evaluate the vowel articulation [30]. In particular, for
voice with dysarthria, VSA is expected to be compressed as a result of vowel centralization
[21]; instead, for both healthy patient’s speeches and hyperarticulated vowels, VSA is expected
to be expanded [8]. In general, dysarthric vowel production is characterized by centralization
of formant frequencies and reduction in static vowel space area [9]. This indication is very
useful in voice monitoring and analysis, where VSA can be applied to vocal signals in order to
perform a more accurate investigation. The vowel space illustration is a graphical method able
to show where a speech signal, generated by the pronunciation of a vowel, is located in both the

acoustic and the articulatory spaces, based on the first two formants for vowels. The horizontal
axis shows the frequency of the first formant (F1 ) and the vertical axis represents the frequency
of the second formant (F2 ). This 2-dimensional representation corresponds to an articulatory
space. VSA is generally constructed by the Euclidean distances between the first formant (F1 )
and second formant (F2 ) coordinates of the corner vowels /i/, /u/, and /a/ (triangular VSA or
tVSA), or the corner vowels /i/, /u/, /a/, and /e/ (quadrilateral VSA, or qVSA) in the F1 − F2
plane. tVSA and qVSA computations are reported following according to [21]:
tV SA = |((F1i ∗ (F2a − F2u ) + F1a ∗ (F2u − F2i ) + F1u ∗ (F2i − F2a ))/2)|

qV SA =

1
(((F1e ∗ F2i ) + (F1a ∗ F2e ) + (F1u ∗ F2a ) + (F1i ∗ F2u ))−
2
((F1i ∗ F2e ) + (F1e ∗ F2a ) + (F1a ∗ F2u ) + (F1u ∗ F2i )))

(6)

(7)

F1 and F2 represent the first and the second formant respectively related to each vowel.
Moreover, another parameter has been evaluated to enhance the sensibility of the analysis:
the Formant Centralization Ratio (FCR) reduces the individual variability within measurements
allowing to better identify dysarthria than the only use of tVSA and qVSA. FCR has been
proposed to maximize sensitivity to vowel centralization and minimize sensitivity to interspeaker
variability and it is calculated as:
F CR = (F2u + F2a + F1i + F1a )/(F2i + F1a )

(8)

The centralization of formants and/or the compression of VSA in dysarthric speakers have
been reported in several contributions [10] [21]. These studies report a significant positive
correlation between VSA and speech intelligibility, demonstrating a correlation between VSA
and speech capability in different neurodegenerative diseases. Modifications of intelligibility
of speech can be associated with MS, so the presented paper proposes the analysis of these
parameters for patients affected by MS with the aim of try to define a range of possible values
correlated to speech alterations.

Experimental Results

The aim of the proposed contribution is to study the vocal signals acquired from patiens affected by MS, in order to evaluate them and to identify relevant patterns. Voice data from
patients affected by MS has been compared with data from healthy subjects. For the study,
53 pathological patients affected by SM between 25 and 74 years of age have been enrolled at
the Neurological Operative Unit, Center of Multiple Sclerosis, in Cosenza (Italy), divided as
follows:
• 18 patients affected by SMSP (7 men and 11 women);
• 35 patients affected by SMRR (11 men and 24 women).
A set of voices between 24 and 68 years has been acquired among healthy subjects.
The acquisition protocol, which has been defined with clinicians, as a first step calls for the
acquisition of an informed consent signed by each patient who participates to the study. The
acquisition of a continuous and sustained pronunciation of the five vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/,

/u/ is performed for 5 seconds. The acquisition has been made inside a clinical laboratory
with optimal acoustic setup and with the subjects sitting comfortably. The vocal signal has
been recorded with an omnidirectional microphone placed near the mouth of subject, by using
a sampling frequency of 22.05kHz and a resolution of 16 bits. All signals have been recorded
in .wav format and analyzed with PRAAT.
Two methodologies of acoustic analysis and vowels metric have been applied to acquired
vocal signals of patients affected by MS and healthy subjects to evaluate the behavior of speech
and identify possible significant patterns for this neurodegenerative disease. The results of both
methodologies have been reported below. Moreover, a statistical analysis has been performed
to find the most significant results.

3.1

Results by Acoustical Analysis

Acoustic analysis has been performed by using PRAAT on vocal signal of subjects enrolled and
the results have been reported in the following tables. The following parameters have been
extracted for healthy subjects (HS) and for patients affected by Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) and by Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS): fundamental
frequency, jitter (absolute and relative), shimmer (relative and dB) and HNR. For all of these
parameters, a discrimination between men and women has been made, taking into account their
different vocal characteristics in terms of frequency.
Table 1 reports the values of fundamental frequency F0 both for healthy and pathological
subjects. Values are expressed in Hz and maximum, minimum and mean are reported. The
general tendency is a reduction of F0 according to Section 2. The results show an increase of
the F0 average in men for SPMS; instead, F0 average decreases in women both for SPMS and
RRMS.

In table 2, relative jitter values are reported for healthy and pathological subjects. Values are
expressed in percentage and maximum, minimum and average are also reported. In this case,
jitter presents an average value of less than 0.5% both for male and female healthy subjects,
in accordance with the standard values reported in section 2. Moreover, the average values of
jitter for male and female pathological subjects are greater than 0.5%, associated to a possible
lack of control in cord vibration for MS disease according to the indication reported in Section
2.

The results for relative shimmer values are reported in Table 3. Values are expressed in
percentage and maximum, minimum and average values are also reported. For shimmer, the
mean values increase in presence of SPMS disease for both men and women; it increases also
for RRMS disease in female patients. An increase of shimmer value in pathological patients
could be associated to mass lesions on vocal cords (see Section 2).

compared to healthy subjects according to values reported in literature. This result could be a
valid indicator in diagnosis and monitoring of MS disease.

Results by vowel metric analysis

Praat has been used to automatically extract all F1 /F2 pairs corresponding to voiced frames
and vowel metric analysis has been performed by using Matlab. In Matlab, a module has been
defined to load F1 and F2 values extracted by PRAAT software and calculate tVSA, qVSA
and FCR according to the equations 6, 7, 8 reported in section 2. Then, the Matlab module
maps F1 /F2 pairs for each vowel in two plots (one for tVSA and one for qVSA respectively) to
compare the different behavior between pathological and health subjects.
Table 5 reports the results of the vowel metric analysis both for healthy subjects and patients
affected by SPMS and RRMS. Generally, the vowel area decreases for pathological subjects.
There is a remarkable reduction of the area for patients with RRMS, even though a tVSA
increases can be notified in SPMS. Moreover, a light increase of the FCR values can be noted
in patients with MS.
To better underline the difference of vowel areas for healthy and pathological subjects,
Figure 1 reports a graphical representation of the qVSA values. The qVSA is calculated as the
area within the irregular quadrilateral formed by the first and second formants (F1 and F2 ) of
the corner vowels /i/, /e/, /a/, and /u/.

The patients affected by RRMS present a lower area. The reduction of the vowel space area
represents a centralization of formant frequencies appearing in dysarthria cases, as indicated in
section 2.

Statistical results

Statistical analysis has been performed to evaluate the obtained results by using the online tool
SISA (Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis). T-test with a confidence interval of 95% has
been used to compare the mean of healthy (HS) and pathological subjects (MS) for the features
showing the highest difference: relative jitter and relative shimmer. Table 6 shows the results
of the statistical test. Mean and standard deviation (SD) values are also reported because they
are necessary to calculate p-value.

The obtained p-value is less than 0.05, which confirms that the observed differences between
healthy and pathological subjects means are statistically significant, with a confidence level of
95%. These values are the results obtained after six months of work; they are preliminary but

Conclusions

The aim of the contribution is to propose a method for the evaluation and identification of
significant patterns in voice samples acquired from patients affected by Multiple Sclerosis. The
obtained results show different values for all parameters, distinguishing normal and pathological
subjects as indicated in literature. Future works include enrolling new patients and perform
additional tests.
