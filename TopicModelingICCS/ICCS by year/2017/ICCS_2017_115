that spatial expansion of the biofilm only takes place if locally no space is available for biomass
to be accumulated and that initial data with compact support have solutions with compact
support [2]. This expresses itself as a sharp biofilm/water interface, where the biomass gradient
blows up. Since biofilm colonies grow, their interfaces with the aqueous phase are not stationary
but change over time, driven by reaction terms. Eventually neighbouring colonies can merge
into a bigger colony, in which case their interfaces merge and dissolve.
The solutions of the underlying PDE are continuous, but due to gradient blow-up at the
interface they loose regularity there. Interface problems with these properties pose difficulties
for computer simulations. This includes potential interface smearing or spurious oscillations
because of the steep biomass gradients at the interface. Furthermore, the singularity in the
density-dependent diffusion coefficient leads to blow up of model coefficients, which poses both
arithmetical difficulties, and forces numerical methods to work with small time-steps in order
to never over-shoot the singularity, even in intermediate steps within an iterative scheme.
The usual space discretization schemes applied to the degenerate PDE lead to ODEs that
do not satisfy a Lipschitz condition. Therefore, a priori it is not clear whether standard timeintegration methods can be used. Even the question whether the semi-discrete problem is wellposed is not clear. In [7] this was studied, and remedied using a regularization approach. This
allowed the application of traditional time-adaptive, error controlled time integration techniques
and overcomes the limitations of previously applied explicit, semi-implicit, and fully-implicit
methods for the biofilm model that require fixed, a priori determined time-steps.
The work in [7] has been restricted to biofilm systems with one biomass fraction only.
Biofilms, however, often are composed of several types of biomass, such as multi-species biofilms
that play an important role, in particular in environmental engineering applications [17]. We
present here an extension of the numerical approach in [7] to such systems.
The specific system that we study is a quorum sensing (QS) active biofilm [5, 14]: bacterial
cells produce and secret chemical signals (a.k.a autoinducers), and measure the concentration
of the signal molecule in their environment [8]. When the signal concentration locally exceeds
a threshold, changes in gene expressions are induced and bacteria synchronize their behavior
(upregulation). This cell-to-cell communication mechanism has been associated with a variety
of microbial processes such as production of EPS, expression of virulence factors, and biofilm
dispersal [4, 6]. In QS models, the population is divided between down- and up-regulated cells.
The specific form of the reaction terms in QS models simplify the analysis, wherefore this is a
suitable test problem for the development and valuation of numerical methods. We emphasize,
however, that these properties are not explicitly used in the numerical method, which is more
generally applicable.

Mathematical Model
Governing Equations

The mathematical model studied in this paper is based on [4, 5, 14]. It is formulated in terms
of the dependent variables up- and down-regulated biomass fractions A and B, concentration
of a growth limiting nutrient N , and concentration of the quorum sensing molecules S.

where M := A + B is the total biomass. The model parameters are defined in Table 1.
Following [2], the biomass diffusion coefficient D(M ) is
D(M ) = δM a (1 − M )−b ,

a > 1,

b > 1.

(2)

D(M ) introduces two non-linear diffusion effects: (i) a power law degeneracy as in the porous
medium equation, i.e. D(0) = 0 and (ii) a super diffusion singularity as M approaches to unity.
The porous medium degeneracy, M a , guarantees that the biofilm does not spread notably if
the total biomass density is small, M  1. It is responsible for the formation of a sharp
interface between biofilm and and surrounding aqueous phase, i.e. initial data with compact
support lead to solutions with compact support. For M = 1 the diffusion coefficient attains
a singularity and blows up. This effect guarantees that the solution is bounded by unity [3].
This is counteracted by the degeneracy as M = 0 at the interface. Consequently, M squeezes
in the biofilm region and approaches but never exceeds its maximum value 1. At the interface
the solution is continuous but the biomass gradient blows up.
The diffusion coefficients for N and S depend on M in a non-critical way,

(1 + M (ρN,S − 1)),
0
where DN,S
> 0 and 0 < ρN,S ≤ 1 are the diffusion coefficients in water, and the ratio of
diffusivity between biofilm and water respectively.
In (1), the growth of biomass and uptake of substrates is described by Monod kinetics.
The conversion of down-regulated and up-regulateed biomass into each other is described
by a Hill-type switch function with exponent n in which τ is the threshold autoinducer concentration required for QS induction to occur.
In the equation for S, we assume that autoinducer is produced at a base rate α by both
biomass fractions, and at an increased rate by upregulated cells. To study (1) we restrict
ourselves to the rectangular domain Ω = [0, L] × [0, H]. The boundary conditions are

Here λ is the concentration boundary layer thickness, and ∂n denotes the outward normal
derivative. The concentration boundary layer is introduced to mimic the convective contribution
of external bulk flow to nutrient supply and signal removal, in the sense that a small bulk flow
velocity implies a thick concentration boundary layer, while a thin concentration boundary
layer represents fast bulk flow [1].
Remark 2.1. Well-posedness of (1)– (3) can be established with the arguments of [14].

Numerical Method

Following [7], in order to obtain a numerical approximation of (1) and (3), we regularize the
model by replacing the biomass diffusion coefficient (2) by

The regularized PDE system is then spatially discretized by a cell-centered finite difference
based finite volume scheme, using a uniform grid of size m × m for a square domain of [0, m] ×
[0, m]. Integrating the first equation of (1) over each grid cell and using the Divergence Theorem
yields

where vij denotes the domain of the cell with grid index (i, j), Jn := D(M )∂n A denotes the

for i = 1, ..., m and j = 1, ..., m with ∆x = L/m and approximate the integral by the midpoint
rule.
The line integral in (5) is evaluated by considering every edge of the grid cell separately
using the midpoint rule. To this end, the diffusion coefficient D(M ) in the midpoint of the
cell edge is approximated by arithmetic averaging from the neighboring grid cell center points,
and the derivative of A across the cell edge by a central finite difference. We get then for the
biomass density in the grid cell center the ordinary differential equation

By construction the m2 × m2 matrices D and DN,S are symmetric, and weakly diagonally
dominant with non-positive main diagonals and non-negative off-diagonals. They contain the
spatial derivative terms. The matrices RiA,B,N , i = 1, 2 and RS are diagonal matrices which
contain the reaction terms; vectors bA,B,N,S contain contributions from boundary conditions.
For  > 0, the semi-discrete system (12) satisfies a Lipschitz condition and is solvable by
a standard stiff ODE solver. We will show numerically that solutions of this regularized ODE
are convergent to the solution of the degenerate problem (12) with  = 0, and that a standard
stiff ODE solver can be applied to solve the degenerate ODE.
Remark 2.2. That (12) preserves non-negativity follows with standard ODE arguments, such
as the tangent criterion. Adding the equations for A and B, by virtue of the specific form of
the reaction terms, gives an ODE for M, which together with the corresponding equation for
N forms the semi-discretized biofilm growth model that was studied in [7]. Therefore, with the
results of [7], it follows that M < 1 for sufficiently small  and ∆x, and that the solution of
(12) converges to the solution of the non-regularised semi-discrete system as  → 0.

2.3

Implementation

We solve the ODE system (12) using the time adaptive, error controlled, embedded RosenbrockWanner method ROS3PL, a third order method with 4 stages [11]. This requires the repeated
solution linear systems of size 4m2 × 4m2 . The coefficient matrices of these systems are sparse
and non-symmetric. We use the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method BiCGSTAB [16]. More
specifically we use a routine from the SPARSKIT library [13], that was prepared for parallel
execution using OpenMP in [10]. Our code is implemented in Fortran and has been tested using
gfortran and the Intel Fortran Compiler on Linux workstations with Intel Xeon processors,
and on an SGI Altix UV system.

Results and Discussion

To interpret the results of computer simulations of our model, we will provide two dimensional
visualizations of the simulations and quantify the effect of QS on the switch between the two
types of biomass fraction by defining the lumped parameters Atotal (t), Btotal (t), Stotal (t) as



Atotal (t) =

S(x, y, t)/τ dxdy
Ω

Ω

(13)
which give the total amount of each biomass fraction and of the autoinducer (relative to the
switching threshold) in the domain.
We carry out a grid refinement study and a computational test to show the convergence of
the solutions of the regularized semi-discrete system to the solutions of degenerate semi-discrete
system for sufficiently small value of regularization parameter .

3.1

Illustrative Simulation

We consider a square domain [0, 1] × [0, 1] discretized by a mesh with m × m = 256 × 256 grid
cells. The simulations shown in Figure 1 are carried out with  = 0, i.e. the equation is solved
in the degenerate limit.

Two semi-spherical colonies of type A are placed initially on the bottom boundary. They
are symmetrically arranged around the center of the substratum. The nutrient concentration
initially is at bulk concentration levels, the autoinducer concentration is initially 0.
Snapshots of the simulation are shown in Figure 1. Initially, the biomass increases in these
colonies but no notable spatial expansion takes place. When M = A + B approaches unity
they begin to spread. As the biofilm grows, more autoinducer is produced and accumulates
in the system. At t = 2, both colonies are still separated and essentially down-regulated as
the autoinducer concentration does not exceed the threshold. The autoinducer concentration
increases as the biomass in the system increases. It exceeds the threshold first at t ≈ 3, at which
substantial upregulation begins. At t = 4, the colonies have merged into one larger colony. It
continues to grow and stratify, with the level of up-regulation in the colony continuing to
increase as the biofilm colony increases in size.
In Figure 2 (left panel) the total amount of biomass and autoinducer in the system are
plotted as a function of t. Atotal increases initially until t ≈ 3, during which time little signal
molecule and up-regulated biomass is in the system. At t ≈ 3, the AHL concentration exceeds
the threshold and QS induction occurs. For t > 3, the amount of down-regulated biomass
decreases, steadily, while the amount of up-regulated biomass, as well as the total biomass
A + B increase quickly.
Initially, the time step h(t) of the simulation increases (cf. Figure 2 [center panel]), indicating
that the initial guess for the time step could have been chosen larger. After a short plateau
phase it decreases and remains constant for t < 2. After that it decreases and attains a plateaus
phase up to time t = 2.2. It drops then and steadily recovers and increases.
In order to show that our numerical method does not produce any spurious oscillations
around the interface or introduce strong interface smearing, we plot in Figure 2 (right panel)
the biomass densities A(t∗ , x∗ , y) and B(t∗ , x∗ , y) at t∗ = 6 and x∗ = 0.5. This indicates that
the method handles the high degree of degeneracy at the interface, and the squeezing induced
by the super-diffusion singularity well.

3.2

Convergence of the Regularization

In order to show the convergence of the solutions of the regularized semi-discrete system to the
solutions of the degenerate system, we carry out simulations for decreasing values of  for a
similar initial setting as in Section 3.1, using a uniform coarse grid of size 128 × 128. We denote
by A , B , N , S the solution obtained for regularization parameters .
For A we define the error between solutions of degenerate and regular semi-discrete problems

as EA
= m12  A0 − A 2 in which A0 is the solution of the non-regularized system (12). We
report this value at t = 6. At this time the colonies are merged into a larger colony and both


down- and up-regulated cells are present. We compute the values of EB
and EN
and ES in the
same manner.
Furthermore, we record the Elapsed CPU time (ECPU) for each  to see weather it is
sensitive to the value of the regularisation parameter. The results for different values of  are
shown in Table 2. The error between solutions of a regularized and degenerate ODE system
is decreasing and converges as  decreases. The elapsed CPU time is slightly decreasing by
increasing the regularization parameter but not considerably.

For a grid refinement study, we consider the degenerate semi-discrete problem (12) with the
same initial setting as in Section 3.1. We consider grids of size 2κ × 2κ where κ is an integer.

EN and ES are computed in the same manner. We report the errors at t = 6 at which the gap

Table 3 shows the least square error between two subsequent solutions at time t = 6. We
observe a steady decrease in errors E κ as the grid is refined, indicating convergence of the
method. It can also be seen that the value of ESκ is slightly larger than the other values of
error, although the order of convergence is almost the same for all species and substrates. Since
we have the density value at the center grids, to compute these data interpolation must be
used which is a source of error so these data cannot be used to determine the convergence rate
accurately.

OpenMP Parallelization

Our code, in particular the linear solver, is partially parallelized using OpenMP as in [10]. It is
compiled under Linux for workstations with Xeon processors, using the Intel Fortran compiler.
We compare simulation times on a short time interval, t ∈ [4, 4.1], for different numbers of
threads and compute the ratio of CPU time for 1 thread to the corresponding CPU time,
U time|n=1
Ac := CP
CP U time|n , in which n is the number of threads. Each simulation was run thrice and
compute times were averaged. Table 4 shows the computed Ac for m = 256 and m = 512. In
both cases for 4 threads the computing time is half of the serial computation and no further
speedup is obtained for larger nubers of threads, which is not unsurprising given the size of our
test problem.

Conclusion

We extended a regularization based numerical approach for a highly degenerate densitydependent reaction-diffusion equation that models biofilm growth to a system of equations
that models a biofilm with more than one biomass fraction. Using regularization, we could
show that standard stiff ODE time-integration schemes can be applied. Our computational
results suggest that this method converges. In fact, in numerical tests, we could show that the
regularisation parameters can be set to 0, although the underlying differential equation then
does not satisfy a Lipschitz condition and is not necessarily well-posed. The time-adaptive
numerical solver still keeps the numerical solution separated from the singularity, as required
per properties of the underlying continuous problem.
Our numerical method is time-adaptive and therefore overcomes a shortcoming of previous
methods for this type of partial differential equations, which all worked with fixed-time steps
and without error control. For the particular example of a quorum sensing active biofilm that
we studied here, the boundedness of the numerical solutions, etc, can be shown with the same
ideas that were used in [7] for the single species growth model, using arguments similar to those
that were used in the analysis of the underlying PDE model in [14]. While the computational

will be required for the analysis.
