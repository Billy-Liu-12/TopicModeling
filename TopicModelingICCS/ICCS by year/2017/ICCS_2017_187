Multiscale Modelling and Simulation, 14th International Workshop

communities to identify and discuss challenges in, and possible solutions for, modelling and
simulating multiscale systems, as well as their execution on advanced computational resources
and their validation against experimental data.
The series of workshops devoted to multiscale modelling and simulation is organized annualy from 2002 [1][2]. This year’s edition attracted 14 accepted presentations, including one
poster presentation. The discussed topics cover a range of application domains as well as
cross-disciplinary research on multiscale simulation.
The workshop will contain the presentations about theoretical, general concepts of the multiscale computing and those focused on specific use-cases and describing real-life applications
of multiscale modelling and simulation.
The theoretically-oriented presentations will include talks about reusable multiscale computing patterns, dynamic load balancing for heterogeneous hardware infrastructure, a multiscale
approach to parabolic equations derivation, and a demonstration on performance monitoring
of multiscale applications.
Our second segment will contain talks about specific use-cases in biology and medicine
science. It will include presentations about personalized anti-tumor therapy, simulation of intimal hyperplasia with gene dynamics, modelling aortic-valve with stenosis, multiscale modelling
systems medicine and the simulations of embryonic branching morphogenesis.
The third segment will focus on engineering, physics and multifactorial optimization problems. In this context the following works will be described: a new strategy to model energetic
material deformation with help of surrogate evaluations, the numerical evaluation of local curvature for diffuse interface models of microstructure evolution, the investigation of stability and
aggregation phenomena for the silica materials, multiscale modeling of problems in astrophysics
with the AMUSE framework, and multiscale modelling of surgical flow in operating rooms.
Given the nature of the workshop, we look forward to lively discussions as communities from
different disciplines will have the opportunity meet and to exchange ideas on general-purpose
approaches from different angles. We hope that workshop will help participants to get familiar
with the latest multiscale modelling, simulation and computing advances from other fields, and
provide new inspiration for their own efforts.
With representation from leading institutions across three continents, the 14th edition of
Multiscale Modelling and Simulation Workshop is indeed at the forefront of computational
science.
