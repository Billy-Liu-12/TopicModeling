1.1

Some general notes about railways

Railways are guided transportation systems [3, 5]. Trains can only move from one track to
another at certain places where the appropriate device, denoted turnout (US: switch) is installed.
The mobile part of the turnout (Figure 1) is called the switch (US: point).
Traffic is controlled by light signals (Figure 2) and semaphores (mechanical devices). The
compatibility of the position of the switches of a railway station (direct track / diverted track )
and the indications of the light signals and semaphores (stop / proceed) is supervised by the
railway interlocking system. The railway interlocking system considers the layout of the station
divided into sections for this purpose.

Figure 3: An electrified small station. The messenger and contact wires are clearly distinguishable.
Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of stations: through stations (situated along a line),
junctions (situated in the intersection of lines) and termini stations (situated at the end of a
line, and which tracks end in buffer stops.
In a station there are tracks off the main line, denoted sidings (see, for instance the tracks
on the right or in the front left of Figure 1). They are used for storing rolling stock or for trains
to overtake or cross (the latter in single-track lines). The different tracks are connected through
turnouts. There are also turnouts connecting the two main tracks at stations when the line is
double-track.
In Europe many lines are nowadays electrified. The ground pole are the rails and, although
some subways and local railways use a third rail as the other pole, most electrified lines use an
overhead contact system or overhead line (Figure 3), also known as catenary (because of the
shape of the upper wire, denoted messenger wire, supporting the contact wire). The contact
wire must be completely horizontal (in some low speed networks such as subways and local
railways, an overhead line with only one wire is used). Electric trains collect the current from
the contact wire using a device called pantograph.
There are three main electrification systems in Europe:
• 1.5KV DC or 3KV DC, that requires the rectification and strong reduction of the voltage
of the energy supplied from the industrial electrical network (220KV or 400KV ) at the
traction substations. It also has another disadvantage: the contact wire requires a bigger
section (due to the higher intensity needed). It is used in Spain, France, Italy, Belgium,
Czech Republic, etc.
• 15KV AC, 16 23 Hz, used in Central and Northern Europe (Germany, Austria, Norway,

Sweden and Switzerland),
• 25KV AC, 50Hz, used, for example, in France, Portugal and the new high speed lines of
other countries such as Spain, Belgium and Italy.
Three-phase AC railway electrifications were experimented in the beginning of the XXth century in some countries (for instance in Southeast Spain, Northern Italy and a military line
in Germany), but despite their advantages from the electrical point of view, the need of two
overhead lines (or three lines at one side of the track) made them impractical.

1.2

Some specific notes about railways electrification

The overhead contact system is divided into electrification sections. For the sake of brevity, when
we say “section” in this paper we shall refer to electrification section, except when otherwise
specified. A special type of section is the neutral section.
There are different kinds of isolation devices between sections1 :
• section insulator (also denoted: insulator ), represented by ,
• air-gap insulator (also denoted: insulated overlap), represented by
and also different “electrical bypasses” of the isolation devices:
• earthing disconnector (also denoted: grounded circuit breaker ), represented by ,
•

• load disconnector (also denoted: ungrounded circuit breaker ), represented by
,

• remote disconnector (also denoted: telecommanded not-grounded circuit breaker ), represented by ,
⊗
Some sections receive the electricity from the traction substation through a feeder.
At an end buffer there is a stop to electric traction.

1.3

Main mandatory requirements of the 3KV DC ADIF electrifications

The main mandatory requirements of the electrification of ADIF railway network are:
i) There should be neutral zones at the end(s) of the stations (both sides in case of through
stations and one side in case of termini stations).
ii) There should be a section insulator in all the connections between main tracks.
iii) Tracks with a buffer stop where maintenance labours could take place should have a
manual grounded section insulator.
iv) There should be a section insulator in all turnouts between main tracks and the rest of
tracks of the station.
v) It should be possible to fed all the electrified tracks of the station.
vi) It should be possible to fed all sidings beside a main track through a load disconnector
from that main track.

vii) In long stations it is allowed to install air-gaps or disconnectors in the main tracks in
order to split them into shorter sections.
viii) Even (resp. odd) sidings are fed from the even (resp. odd) main track or even (resp. odd)
sidings.

2

Design of the electrical connectivity

We consider two steps in the description of the layout. There are some fixed issues: the topology
of the electrification of the station and the position of the isolation and feeding devices. And
there are other issues that change along time: whether the “electrical bypasses” allow electric
current to pass through them or not and whether the feeders feed the corresponding section or
not.
The approach uses digraphs (introduced through their adjacency matrices –they are Boolean
matrices). These matrices are stored as global variables.
The topology of the electrification of the station is introduced as a digraph, C (its adjacency
matrix is denoted M C). This is a sparse matrix of “zeroes” with a few “ones” (and a diagonal
of “ones”).
The adjacency matrices of the digraphs indicating where the isolation devices (section insulators and air-gap insulators) are installed are denoted M SI and M AI, respectively. These
are sparse matrices of “ones” with a few “zeroes”.
The adjacency matrices of the digraphs indicating where the electrical bypasses (earthing
disconnectors, load disconnectors and remote load disconnectors) are installed are denoted
M ED, M LD and M RD, respectively. These are sparse matrices of “zeroes” with a few “ones”.
Electricity will pass from an electrification section to another if and only if it is topologically
possible and there is no isolation device between those sections (excluding the isolation devices
bypassed by a device allowing electricity passing by).
The adjacency matrix corresponding to the isolation devices is:
M ID = M SI ∧ M AI
(where ∧ represent the multiplication element by element of the matrices).
The adjacency matrix corresponding to the electrical bypasses is:
M CB = reduce to Boolean(M ED + M LD + M RD)
(note that this process constructs the adjacency matrix of the graph that is the “logic conjuntion” of the 3 input graphs).
Therefore, the adjacency matrix corresponding to the digraph with the information regarding whether electricity passes to an adjacent section or not will be:
M P = reduce to Boolean((M C ∧ M ID) + M CB)
Consequently, the transitive closure of M P , denoted M , is the adjacency matrix of the
electrical connectivity of the electrification of the station for a given state of the electrical
bypasses.
The key idea is that the sections not isolated from a certain section, for instance the nth
section, are given by the “ones” in the nth row of matrix M .

Implementation

Procedure initialize resets all variables. It has an input that consists on the numbers of
sections of main and secondary tracks (all together).

3.1

Fixed data introduction procedures

The connectivity between sections (due to the layout of the electrification) is introduced using
procedure connected.
The positioning of section insulators and air gap insulators, is introduced through procedures
section insul and air gap insul (respectively).
The lists of electrification sections on each of the two main tracks (optional input) are mt1
and mt2 (respectively), that should be included in the list of main tracks (Lmt). The list of
secondary tracks is obtained from this information.

3.2

Variable data introduction procedures

The fed sections are introduced in a list using procedure fed (they can be: sections of the main
track, powered from adjacent sections, or sections powered by feeders).
The positioning of earthing disconnectors, load disconnectors and remote load disconnectors
is introduced through procedures earthing disc, load disc and remote load disc (respectively).

3.3

Auxiliary procedures

• Procedure mult el el takes as input two matrices and computes the “multiplication
element by element” (sometimes denoted “conjuntion”) of the input matrices.
• Procedure reduce Boolean takes a matrix as input and reduces elements greater than 1
to 1 (reduces the input matrix to a Boolean matrix).
• Procedure transit closure takes the adjacency matrix of digraph as input and computes
the transitive closure of the digraph (it is a recursive procedure that multiplies the input
matrix by itself and reduces it to a Boolean matrix, until the process stabilizes).

3.4

Output data

The procedure that computes matrix M is denoted main. After executing it, the system can
provide:
• the names of the powered sections (according to the fed ones introduced), executing
procedure pow names,
• the lists of powered/unpowered sections of main/secondary tracks, executing the corresponding procedure from: pow main tracks, unpow main tracks, pow sec tracks,
unpow sec tracks.
These output data can also be obtained for a subgraph of the electrification layout (in such
case matrix M aux substitutes matrix M as input, as shown in the examples in Section 4).

Figure 4: Real technical details of the electrification of a small station. “VIA” means “track”.
Roman numerals are used for numbering the main line tracks and Hindu-Arabic numerals for
numbering the secondary tracks. Note that even numbers and odd numbers are used on each
side of the main tracks, respectively.

Example

Let us consider the example of Figure 4. This small station has no feeders (the connection with
the electric network is through the overhead contact system of the main tracks).
The electrification sections have to be manually determined by the expert from the diagram.
In this case he/she has denoted the sections on the main track I as 1, 2,. . . , 6 (from left to
right), the sections on the main track II as 7, 8,. . . , 12 (from left to right), the electrification
sections below main track II as 13 and 14 and those above main track I as 15 and 16.
The user should begin by restarting, loading the linear package and loading the electrification
package. Afterwards the data are introduced (for the sake of brevity the “. . . ” in the code
substitute similar inputs). Then the main procedure can be executed:
restart;
with(linalg):
read(‘ElectriFFCC_7_ENG.mpl‘);
initialize(12,4):
connected(1,2):
connected(2,3):
connected(3,9):

It is obvious from the non-null submatrices of matrix M that there are (in this case)
two disconnected areas, formed by the electrification sections {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16} and
{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14} (that is, the two main tracks are isolated form each other and connected to the sections on their respective sidings). Note that the different kinds of electrical
bypasses are considered to let electricity pass through unless otherwise stated.
If the system is informed that sections 1 and 6 are fed (from adjacent sections, in this case),
it can compute the electrification sections under electric tension:

fed([1,6],M);
pow_names([1,6],M);

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16]
(that is, the upper half of the station –track I and its sidings).
Let us turn off three remote load disconnectors and declare which are the main tracks:

remote_load_disc(2,3,0):
remote_load_disc(4,15,0):
remote_load_disc(13,14,0):

Regarding the requirements in Section 1.3, to check ii) it is enough to introduce that no
“electrical bypasses” allow electricity to pass by, feed each main track all the possible ways
(simultaneously), and check that no section of the other main track is fed. Requirements iv),
vi), vii) and viii) can be checked similarly. Requirement v) can be checked introducing that all
“electrical bypasses” allow electricity to pass by, feed all possible sections (fed from the traction
substation or from the overhead contact system of the main track), and check that there is no
section left.

Conclusions and Future Work

Errata are often found in cumbersome and laborious work, as the one that the expert has to
perform to check a railway electrification installation proposal during the design step. This
package is able to compute the answers to required by the verification process (the expert has
to manually introduce the data of the layout and the questions desired). Therefore, we believe
it can be a very useful computer application.
There are very many works related to railway electrifications, ranging from the advantages
and disadvantages of the different electrification systems [1] or energy optimization [2], but
we know of no similar work. Moreover, this work focuses on problems derived from the real
requirements of a specific railway infrastructure authority (ADIF).

A Matrix Approach to DC
Railway
Electrification
González-Martı́n

We have tested the implementation with a few small real examples of railway electrifications,
like the one shown in Figure 4. We plan to test the implementation extensively with more real
examples.
As future work, we plan to compare the matrix implementation with other possible approaches (using different techniques). An extension would be to treat the same problem for AC
electrifications. Moreover, trying to automatize the testing of the expert could be addressed.
