optimization of the cell phone antenna, to extend the cell-phone battery lifetime. It has been
also solved for the material data based on the MRI scan of the human head [4], but with the
heat source representing the cell-phone radiation approximated, based on the results obtained
by [2]. In this paper, we analyze the possibility of incorporating a full solution of the Maxwell
equations for the modeling of the cell phone antenna, and its influence on the computational
cost of the solver algorithms. Namely, we propose to perform adaptive iterations of Maxwell
problem solution at the same time with progressing in time with the iterations of the Pennes
equations. The resulting parallel algorithms speed up the execution of the challenging nonstationary problem. For the time stepping procedure, we utilize the Crank-Nicolson scheme.
For the solution of the systems of linear equations we utilize the multi-frontal direct solver [5, 6]
as implemented in the MUMPS library [7] with weighted nested-dissections element partition
trees [8, 9] transformed into the ordering as described in chapter 8 of [10] and sent to MUMPS
in PERM IN array.

Modeling of the cell phone antenna

In electromagnetics, we can substitute any domain by “equivalent currents” [16]on the boundary
that encloses the domain and the field outside that domain are the same that if we analyze the
whole problem at hand. Applying the above idea to an antenna problem, and specifically to a
wire antenna problem (e.g., a dipole, monopole, Yagi-Uda, etc), we can substitute the antenna
wires by the current densities J on the wires. However, we do not know the exact current of the
antenna problem, but for a given simple antennas there are very good approximations of the
current and they are used in practice in antenna modeling and design. Thus, we can substitute
our antenna, which typically has small features that make the initial hp mesh to have small
elements that propagate to the mesh boundaries, with simply an impressed current density in
the formulation that does not affect the mesh discretization. In the case of dipole type antennas
(chosen for to excite the head in our case) we simply have to add a current density along a line
of the problem domain. Specifically, the variation of the current along the line is of sinusoidal
type. We use the frequency domain so the electric and magnetic field magnitudes, and also
current density and so on, are phasors (complex numbers). The mathematical model in the
frequency domain to characterize the electromagnetic field in a given problem domain ΩFEM is
given by the double curl wave equation [11] in terms of either electric (E) or magnetic (H) field

where k0 is the wavenumber in a vacuum, V is the unknown field and P/L are the impressed
electric and/or magnetic currents within ΩFEM . Table 1 shows the different magnitudes involved
in the E and H formulations. In the hp adaptive finite element method formulation we use
the E formulation,
i.e., V = E, so the current density J corresponds to P and h0 = ηo

where η0 = µ0 /0 . For simplicity the boundary conditions considered on the model under
verification will be of Dirichlet, Neumann and Cauchy types:

conditions, respectively, apply. Symbol n̂ is the outward unit vector to the considered boundary
surface. Above boundary conditions are typically used to model perfect electric and magnetic
boundaries, waveports, and even exterior boundaries in open radiation and scattering problems.
Symbol γ denotes complex propagation constant of the corresponding waveport mode or exterior
wave. In the E formulation ΓD is PEC and ΓN is PMC. As the antenna metal has been
substituted by some J we do not have any PEC (neither PMC). For the exterior radiation
boundary condition we do not use (4) in hp computations. We use the PML formulation
instead. The formulation that is discretized by FEM is the so-called variational (or weak)

Details of how to get from differential formulation to variational formulation above shown are
given, for instance, in Section 3.1 of Ph.D. thesis of Daniel Garcia-Doñoro [12].
In our model σ is the conductivity of the medium, the current density is J = σE where E is
the electric field. It causes electromagnetic losses. When complex dielectric permittivity is used,
its imaginary part is proportional to the conductivity. Specific absorption rate, qSAR = |E|2/σ .
It measures exposure to fields between 100 kHz and 10 GHz (known as radio waves). It is
commonly used to measure power absorbed from mobile phones and during MRI scans. The
value will depend heavily on the geometry of the part of the body that is exposed to the RF
energy, and on the exact location and geometry of the RF source. One of the constitutive
relations relates in the time domain the electric flux density to the electric field intensity by
D = E where  is the permittivity of the medium [Farads/meter]. For the free space  =
0 = 8.854 × 1012 [Farads/meter]. Another relation equates the magnetic flux density to the
magnetic field intensity by B = µH where µ is the permeability of the medium [Henries/meter].
For the free space µ = µ0 = 4Π × 107 [Henries/meter]. Finally, the conduction current density
σ is related to the electric field intensity by J = σE where σ is conductivity of the medium
(siemens/meter). For the free space σ = 0. In our model for the brain, tissue, skull and air, we
utilize the parameters values taken from [2].

Numerical results for the parallel algorithm

This section describes the execution of our algorithm on six Linux cluster nodes with 2.4 GHz
intel processor with 8 cores and 32 GB of RAM, equipped with a parallel file system. We
start from an initial mesh. We solve the Maxwell equation with assumed cell-phone source
antenna, material data from MRI scan data, measured at the Gauss quadrature integration
points. Next, we run one iteration of the hp-adaptivity for the Maxwell equations. The code
selects and executes the optimal hp refinements. We dump out the computational mesh from
the Maxwell code and dump into to the Pennes equation code. We solve one-time step of
the Pennes equations, using the hp-refined mesh generated by the Maxwell code with qSAR
obtained by post-processing the solution of the Maxwell equation, and with material data from
MRI scan data, measured at the Gauss quadrature integration points. We execute one iteration
of the hp-adaptivity and dump out the mesh. We dump in the mesh into the Maxwell code,
and proceed with the second iterations of the hp-adaptivity for the Maxwell code. At the same
time, we send the Pennes equation solution, and the Maxwell solution with qSAR to the next
processor, which starts the next iteration of the Pennes equation in the next time step. The
iterations of the hp-adaptive code on the Maxwell equations and on the Pennes equations are
presented in Table 2. The numerical results are summarized in Figure 1.

Conclusions

We proposed the parallel algorithm for simultaneous time stepping and space adaptive iterations, for solution of difficult coupled problems. We tested the algorithm on the Maxwell
equations coupled with the Pennes bio-heat equations. We show that our strategy allows reduction of the computational cost, by employing multiple cores and parallel space adaptivity
and time progressing. Namely, we can utilize the intermediate solutions with actual accuracy
to progress with time iterations and update them later when the solutions from previous time
steps with better accuracy are available. From our numerical results, it follows that 10 minutes
(600 seconds) exposure to the cell phone radiation implies up to 2 Celsius increase of the temperature of the brain in the range close to the cell phone. We really do not know how harmfull is
that to the human brain. A future work may involve incorporation of the graph-grammar based
domain decomposition paradigm for the 3D hp-adaptive code, as described in [13, 14, 15].
