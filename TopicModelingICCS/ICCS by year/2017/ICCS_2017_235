Consider there are r independent random walkers on a network G. For each random walker
taking T steps, there will be a probability distribution on the set of visited sites. Intuitively,
larger path distances between the initial positions of the walkers will lead to a smaller overlap
between the probability distribution of the walkers. Since a smaller overlap implies there is
less time wasted by the walkers, the average searching time can be shortened. This intuition is
verified by the theoretical analysis on the case of two walkers. We thus like to find the set of
origins of the random walkers that minimize the overlap. In this paper, we use genetic algorithm
[6] to find an optimal set of initial nodes. We employ a special evolutionary framework with
a mutation matrix, which was called the mutation only genetic algorithm (MOGA), to design
the optimization algorithm. MOGA was first introduced by Szeto and Zhang [7] and later
generalized by Law and Szeto to include crossover [8, 9]. Simulations are performed on the two
main kinds of random networks: WS and BA, with satisfactory results.

Global Mean First-Passage Time and Overlap

Consider a connected and undirected finite network G = (V, E) with adjacency matrix A. The
degree of a node i is denoted by ki . A Random walk is a discrete-time stochastic process. A
walker at node i will choose one of its neighbors as the next step with equal chances. For a
random walker, if it starts at the initial node i, the chance of finding it at node j at time t is
denoted by Pij (t). We may introduce the stochastic matrix Sij = Aij /ki and the probability
distribution row vector [Pi (t)]j = Pij (t). Then the master equation of a random walk is
Pi (t) = Pi (t − 1)S = Pi (0)St .
Our goal is to optimize the global mean first-passage time (GMFPT) while searching by
multiple walkers. However, computing the GMFPT needs the global topological structure of
the network and is time-consuming since it converges slowly when we simulate random walks.
In order to design an algorithm to optimize the GMFPT, we first want to find a fast computable
quantity that is monotonically related to it. Following our intuition that an overlap between
the probability distributions of distinct walkers is a waste of searching time, we expect that a
smaller overlap may result in a smaller GMFPT.
Now we want to verify the intuition by rigorous derivations. Theoretically, we may
only consider the case of two walkers start at nodes a and b, as one can easily generalize to the case of more walkers. For a walker starts at node a, we define Gaj (t)
as the probability that node
has not been visited by walker a till time t. Then the

 ij (z) and
on the positive real axis is always real and positive. By these facts we conclude that G
Pij (z) are positively correlated with each others.
Following the analysis above, we may focus on minimizing the total overlap to optimize the
GMFPT. This is the starting point of the genetic algorithm introduced in this paper, in which

we define the total overlap as the fitness function. Computing the mutual overlap is faster
and only requires local topological structures in the surrounding region of initial nodes if we
imposed an appropriate cutoff time.

Mutation Only Genetic Algorithm

We start with formally defining the optimization problem as ”the optimal set of initial nodes”
problem. The input is an undirected network G with size |V | represented by the adjacency list
and the number of random walkers r. While the output is the optimal initial nodes of these r
random walkers. To construct the set of r initial nodes, we may start from randomly choosing a
node and iteratively run the genetic algorithm to decide a new initial node which has minimum
overlap with the existed ones, and then add it to the set. Following this strategy, the search
space of the genetic algorithm is reduced to the set of nodes V .
We use a special class of genetic algorithm, the mutation only genetic algorithm (MOGA),
(note that it does not stand for the multi-objective genetic algorithm), which defines a more
general formulation of mutation. Suppose there are N chromosomes of L-bits in the decreasing
order of fitness. We assign different mutation probabilities to each locus and they form the
mutation matrix M of size N × L, where Mij is the probability to mutate the j-th locus of the
i-th chromosome.
The design of chromosome representation requires the definition of a one-to-one correspondence between a set of L-bit binary chromosomes and V . However, if a chromosome is encoded
with the degree and the clustering coefficient of the node, since they are not contiguous on the
network, we cannot easily find the new node which is represented by the mutated chromosome.
An approach to solve this problem is to define the chromosome as a sequence of characters of
the nodes on a specific path from a preset node. We thus only need to search among the nearest
neighbors to find the new node correspond to the mutated chromosome. And we can obtain the
candidate node from a path by picking out the last node. A difficulty of this representation is
that the chromosomes may have variable length. However, we can easily extend the length of a
chromosome by filling the remaining space with the characters of the last node in the path. In
practice, we extend all chromosomes to a fixed length, which is larger than the diameter dmax
of the network G.
The design of mutation matrix is special since our chromosomes represent paths. To achieve
effective exploration and exploitation at the same time, we should only mutate the last several
loci of a fit chromosome to perturb the end of the path and search the surrounding area of the
current node, while mutate nearly all the loci of an unfit chromosome, so as to generate new
paths for search in the region far from the current solution. Since there is no fixed meaning of a
specific locus, the mutation probabilities should not depend on the statistics of loci. We define
the mutation matrix as,




M=



1/2

···
···
···








The special triangular form with each element being 1/2 perturbs the ends of fit paths and
uniformly generates new paths simultaneously. Numerical results verify that the special design
of the chromosomes and the mutation matrix helps the genetic algorithm provide solutions
closed to the optimum in reasonable time.

Numerical Results and Conclusions

We run the genetic algorithm on two kinds of random networks (Watts-Strogatz and BarabásiAlbert). Firstly, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm by computing the fitness of the
fittest chromosome in each generation and draw Figure 1. We vary the size |V | and the average
degree k of BA networks and the rewiring probability β of WS networks. From Figure 1a,
we can see that the average improvement of fitness within 50 generations does not explicitly
depend on |V |, but decreases with increasing k. From Figure 1b, we find that the improvement
strictly decreases with respect to β. Note that a small β in WS model leads to a flat degree
distribution and a large average path length d. By these observations, we conclude that our
algorithm has better performance on networks with small average degree k and large average
path length d. This may be because the GMFPTs of all possible sets of r initial nodes in
networks with large k and small d is sharply distributed so that there is limited room for
improvement.

on BA and WS networks. The fitness is normalized with respected to its initial value and averaged on
30 independent experiments.
Secondly, we compute the path lengths between all pairs of initial nodes produced by the
algorithm. We expect that every two initial nodes are far from each other so that the total
overlap is small. Consider the special case of a regular ring lattice, in which the optimal
positions of r = 3 random walkers should be arranged with equal spacing on the ring so that
the path lengths between them are approximately 2dmax /3, where dmax is the diameter. For WS
networks with small β, which is not far from regular ring lattices, we expect the distribution of
path lengths of the set of r = 3 initial nodes also has a sharp peak at 2dmax /3. This is verified
by numerical results shown in Figure 2.
Finally, we calculate the percentage reduction of the GMFPT of the selected set of initial
positions compared to the average. Table 1 summarizes the reduction of the GMFPT of BA
networks with various k and WS networks with various β.
We conclude that we have found a method to optimize the global mean first-passage time
(GMFPT) by choosing the starting nodes of multiple random walkers to search for a general
target in a complex network. As the GMFPT of multiple random walkers depends monotonically
on the overlap, we can minimize the total overlap to reduce GMFPT. We achieve this with the
mutation only genetic algorithm (MOGA) which finds the initial position of a new walker
that has minimum overlap with the existing ones. Special forms of the chromosomes and the

Numerical works on WS and BA networks confirm the effectiveness of our method, as shown in
Table 1. Our method may be very useful in speeding up searches on large networks. We expect
further improvement by means of a more sophisticated MOGA with crossover [8].
