neighborhood. A multidimensional Manhattan street network model is proposed for exchanging
global information. Chusov et al. [3] develop a highly parallel approach for the simulation of
acoustic fields in enclosed media. The algorithm is based on the approximate superposition
of acoustic fields, and incorporates scattering properties of reflecting boundaries. Rasthofer et
al. [5] present a high performance framework for the large-scale simulation of compressible multicomponent flows, applied to cloud cavitation collapse. Based on the authors’ Cubism library for
the efficient treatment of high-order compact stencil schemes, the framework allows processing
up to 1013 computational cells. The paper by de Doncker and Yuasa addresses 3-loop vertex
Feynman diagrams with massless internal lines, which may further exhibit UV-singularities.
Methods from the ParInt multivariate integration package are combined with linear extrapolation to approximate the leading coefficients of the integral expansion with respect to the
dimensional regularization parameter.
The workshop reports on parallel methods and their analyses for various applications in
large-scale computational physics. Some are presented in the context of a library or framework
(such as the NAStJA system, ParInt and Cubism libraries, and the OmpSs framework). In
most cases the approaches are validated using classical benchmark examples, and/or compared
favorably to established results in the literature.
