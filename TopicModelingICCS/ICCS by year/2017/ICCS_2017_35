based on the designer’s risk preferences and has not yet been introduced in aerodynamic design. In this
paper, utility theory is integrated with efficient methods to compute statistical information to create an
efficient and effective aerodynamic design under uncertainty approach. A numerical example of
transonic airfoil design is used to illustrate the approach.

2 Problem Formulation
This section describes the standard and the proposed approach to formulating the design problem.

2.1 Standard Formulation
The aim is to design transonic airfoil shapes insensitive to uncertainties in the operational parameters.
More specifically, the airfoil performance, such as the drag coefficient, should vary as little as possible
for a given range of operational condition. This is often called robust design, or design under uncertainty
(see, e.g., Shah et al., 2015). The most widely adopted approach for robust airfoil design is to find the
deterministic shape parameters to minimize the sum of the mean drag coefficient and the standard
deviation of the drag coefficient subject to constraints on the mean lift coefficient and the airfoil
thickness for a range of uncertain operational Mach numbers.
In this work, the problem is formulated using the conventional approach as follows. For the uncertain
Mach number M∞, find the deterministic airfoil shape parameters x to minimize (Shah et al., 2015)


f (x) Cd (x)   Cd (x) ,

(1)

h( x) 
Cl *  Cl (x) 
0,

(2)

g j (x) 
t *j t j (x)  0 ,

(3)

subject to

and

where Cd is the mean drag coefficient, Cd is the standard deviation of the drag coefficient, Cl is the
mean lift coefficient, Cl* the required mean lift coefficient, tj is the airfoil thickness at location j, with j
= 1 to m, and tj* is the minimum airfoil thickness at location j. The airfoil shape parameters have the
upper and lower bounds u and l, respectively, i.e., x  [l,u]. It is assumed that the uncertain Mach
number is distributed uniformly within the range M∞  [M∞,l, M∞,u], where M∞,u, and M∞,l are the upper
and lower bounds on the Mach number, respectively.

2.2 Formulation by Utility Functions
An alternative formulation to the conventional approach of (1)-(3) is investigated. In particular, airfoil
design under uncertainty is formulated based on utility theory (Neumann and Morgenstern, 1947).
Utility theory translates a range of targeted responses, due to uncertainty in operational parameters, at a
specific design point, using a specific function, called the utility function, to metrics used for design
comparison. Within the utility function, one can change a parameter to obtain a given risk preference of
the designer-called risk aversion (or risk avoiding), risk neutral, and risk loving (risk taking) of the
targeted function. These three types of risk preferences are shown graphically in Fig. 1.

A commonly used utility function U is written as

(4)

where, V denotes a scalar, or a vector, with the objective function responses, and α is the constant
controlling risk reference. Positive α represents risk aversion, while negative α represents risk loving.
Given the probability P(Vi) and utility function response U(Vi) of Vi, the ith objective function response,
the expected utility of objective function responses at this specific design point, is defined as

(5)

Another term, called the certainty equivalent, is defined as
C  U 1 ( EU ) .

(6)

In terms of the airfoil design problem, the problem formulation with utility functions is defined as
follows. For the uncertain Mach number M∞, find the deterministic airfoil shape parameters x to
minimize
f (x)  C (x) ,

(7)

where C(x) is given by (6) with V = Cd(x), and subject to the same constraints (2) and (3).

3 Stochastic Surrogates by Polynomial Chaos Theory
In this work, the stochastic expansions are generated using non-intrusive polynomial chaos theory. For
this purpose, the open-source UQLab (Marelli and Sudret, 2014) is utilized, which is a MATLAB-based
uncertainty quantification framework, and contains state-of-the-art, highly optimized algorithms,
making it easy to use and deploy. Stochastic surrogates are constructed in UQLab using Polynomial
Chaos expansions (PCE) (Xiong et al., 2011). In particular, this work utilizes the least angle regression

sparse (LARS) algorithm (Xiong et al., 2010) in combination with the non-intrusive polynomial chaos
(NIPC) theory (Shah et al., 2015).

4 Numerical Example
The proposed approach is illustrated on a numerical example involving the robust design of transonic
airfoil shapes. This section gives the details of the problem statement, modeling, and optimization
results.

4.1 Problem Statement
The goal is to obtain an optimal airfoil shape which could be insensitive with respect to the uncertain
characteristics of Mach number. Mach number is of uniform distribution [0.70, 0.75], with target lift
coefficient set as 0.5, and Reynolds number of 6.5106, and subjected to thickness constraints at 20%
chord and 80% chord locations. The design variable bounds are set as 1±25% of the baseline airfoil
RAE 2822. More specifically, the problem is formulated as
min f ( x )
l x u

s.t. Cl *  0.5
t/c

t/c

t/c

t/c



x / c 0.2
RAE 2822, x / c 0.2


x / c 0.8
RAE 2822, x / c 0.8

where f(x) is the objective function (described in Sect. 2), x is the vector of design variables (in this case
we use six B-spline control points), Cl is the lift coefficient, and t/c is the thickness to chord ratio.

4.2 Computational Modeling
In this work, the Stanford University Unstructured (SU2) is used as the flow solver (Palacios et al., 2013).
SU2 is an open-source integrated computational environment for multi-physics simulation and design. The
Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved using the Spalart-Allmaras (SA)
turbulence model. The computational grid is generated using Pointwise.

4.3 Optimization Results
The baseline and optimized designs are given in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the design based on the utility
function with risk aversion is less sensitive in the objective function to the uncertain Mach number than
the design obtained by the standard method. Figure 4 shows Mach contour plots of the baseline design
and the design optimized by the utility function. There we can see that the optimized design is nearly
shock-free throughout the range of Mach numbers, which is the reason for the constant drag coefficient
with Mach number. Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the pressure coefficient distributions at several free-stream
Mach numbers.

5 Conclusion
Utility theory has been integrated with stochastic expansions to form an efficient and rigorously
formulated approach for aerodynamic design under uncertainty. The results of an application to the
design of airfoils in two-dimensional viscous transonic flow with the Mach number as an uncertain
variable show that designs with drag coefficients insensitive to the Mach number can be obtained at a
low cost.
