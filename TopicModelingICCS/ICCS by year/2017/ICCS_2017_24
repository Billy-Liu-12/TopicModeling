On Refugee Aid Deployment Policy
Perez Estrada, Groen and Ramirez-Marquez

To predict how a crisis will unfold — or indeed, better understand the full complexity of past
crises — many attempts have been made to model the movement of people in such emergencies
[2] [3]. In the literature, agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulation appears to be the favored
method to tackle these problems, from addressing situations in a single city [4], migration due
to climate events [5], country-wide conflict [6], situations inside an individual refugee camp
[7], or migration in general [8]. Flee [3], a network-based ABM specifically developed for the
modeling of refugee crises, is used extensively in this work.
Good simulation models are invaluable as support for decision makers, particularly if the insights generated, though complex, are easily comprehensible by subject matter experts without
requiring deep knowledge into the inner workings of the simulation itself. We believe experts
in refugee crisis management would greatly benefit from a simulation system and interface
that could help in directly exploring alternative policies and actions, as well as their ensuing
consequences.

1.2

Games for solving problems

Interactive simulations and video games can be themselves a tool to tackle computationally
hard problems, using human-based computation techniques. These methods consist of having
a computer offload tasks to a human whenever an intractable problem is encountered. As such,
the computer and human participant cooperate in finding a solution to a problem, having leveraged the strengths of each other. This approach has been used in applications such as speech
processing, music generation and recognition, knowledge acquisition, information retrieval, and
robotics [9].
When these problems are framed as games, some are able to attract a large enough player
base that they can crowd-source solutions. Games like BioGames [10], Phylo [11], EyeWire [12]
and FoldIt [13] have enabled thousands of players to participate in the solution of problems in
biological and medical science.
This work entails the adaptation of a video game designed to tackle the Robust Facility
Location Problem (RFLP) into an interactive simulation intended to assist policy and decision
makers with examining the costs and humanitarian impacts of potential actions, as well as being
distributable to a large audience in order to obtain crowd-sourced solutions to crisis scenarios.

1.3

Robust facility location problem

The facility location problem (FLP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves
choosing where a set of facilities are to be placed in order to minimize the costs of servicing
a set of demand centers. Each demand center has its own magnitude of demand. A solution
candidate is evaluated by its total cost: the sum of the operating cost of having those facilities
open, and the cost of transport between a demand center and its closest facility. If the facilities
are modeled as having unlimited capacity, an instance of the problem is of the uncapacitated
variant. If limits in capacity are considered, then it is capacitated [14].
The basic formulation of the FLP considers static scenarios, where the parameters of the
problem such as the location of the demand centers and their magnitude, remain constant. If
these conditions change with time, the problem becomes dynamic. Solutions to this kind of
problem can have one of two objectives: finding a solution that will stay in place and must
remain cost-effective for a length of time despite changing circumstances; or optimizing costs
while allowing for the relocation of facilities, considering the costs of doing so [15] [16].
The FLP has been proven to be NP-complete [17]. In order to obtain sufficiently good
solutions in reasonable time frames, it is usually tackled with heuristics, approximations [18],

or meta-heuristics like genetic algorithms [19].
The robust variant of the problem (RFLP [19]) considers the possibility of failure of facilities,
and the re-assignment of demand centers to facilities to resume normal operations. The RFLP
is a multi-objective optimization problem, where a trade-off is considered between the cost of a
solution before any failures occur, and the cost of the same solution after a number of facilities
have failed. For example, while a redundant facility will increase the total cost of a solution
when all facilities function as normal, that redundancy might save costs after a failure, since
the demand will continue to be addressed efficiently.

1.4

Refugee crisis and refugee movements

A common trait of forced migrants is an immediate need for safety and survival. When a large
crisis emerges, these migrants therefore will go on the move, searching for places where these
basic needs can be fulfilled. The exact movement patterns of forced migrants depend on a very
wide range of conditions, but in the case of refugees approximate predictions of their preferred
destinations can be made using simulations [3]. Destinations of forced migrants can differ, as
some people will end up staying within their home country (Internally Displaced People), while
others may have the means to find safety and survival on their own, without external help.
Within this work we look specifically at forced migrants that lack the means to survive on their
own, and that require additional resources and support (e.g., in refugee camps).

1.5

Formulating refugee crisis management as a dynamic RFLP instance

The problem of modeling and analyzing refugee crisis situations shares many similarities with
the RFLP, from the perspective of giving the refugees the attention they require as efficiently as
possible. Simpler formulations of the FLP have been applied in the context of natural disasters
[20], and as a part of the larger field of humanitarian logistics [21].
In this context, the needs of refugees (shelter, food, water, security, etc.) is considered as
demand that needs to be satisfied. Refugees are located at geographical locations — cities or
regions — that correspond to the demand centers that need to be attended. The more people
found at a given location, the higher the magnitude of the demand there.
For this purpose, the facilities are the ones established for assisting refugees to fulfill their
needs, in particular, refugee camps. Given a crisis scenario, solving the problem corresponds to
choosing the locations where refugee camps will be opened and operated.
Many of variables to be minimized in a refugee crisis, namely quick and efficient attention
to the people that need it (expressed as geographical proximity from affected areas to a camp),
as well as maximizing the amount of people that can be assisted (expressed as an efficient use
of resources), correspond to the optimality criteria of the FLP. It is therefore desirable in both
cases that facilities be placed where they will be most efficient at attending demand.
Since the amount of people affected and requiring aid is time-dependent, the problem is
modeled as a dynamic instance of the FLP.
In addition, the changing landscape of available locations on which to establish facilities can
be thought of as a time-dependent potential for facility failure, which the RFLP can tackle. For
example, if during a crisis a border between an affected country and its neighbor is suddenly
closed to refugees, facilities located in the neighboring country may be modeled as having failed
and rendered disabled.
There are, however, some important differences between the formulation of these two problems.

While facilities for the assistance of refugees may have a fixed capacity, due to the difficulty
inherent in estimating affected populations in emergency situations [22], they are often overpopulated, to the detriment of the living conditions of their occupants [23]. A simple capacitated
FLP is not able to model such a situation. Fortunately, variants of the FLP that consider ”soft”
limits on facility capacity, which incur in penalties when exceeded, have been studied and have
been shown to be adequately solvable [24].
Due to the delicate and complex nature of these situations, a straightforward cost function
that accounts for every aspect, such as the humanitarian consequences and political costs,
cannot be formulated. While there is certainly a monetary cost of operating refugee camps,
it is only one facet of the overall problem. Numerous additional considerations in a refugee
crisis cannot be easily encoded as a numerical optimization problem, notably ones that are
geopolitical in nature. For these issues, we defer to the experts that are presented with choices
by our interactive simulation.

2.1

Design and Implementation
Video game for solving the RFLP

This work is based on a game that aims to provide solutions to the Robust Facility Location
Problem. The User Interface (UI) for the game presents the player with a 2D visualization
of demand centers and their connections to their assigned facility. The game is scored by the
total cost, which is the sum of: the cost of having the facilities open; and the distance cost,
incurred by having facilities far away from the demand centers. Figure 1 shows an example of
the visualization the game uses for an RFLP instance.
In the game, demand centers are represented by blue spots, shaded according to the magnitude of the demand. Facilities are represented by black squares. Lines connecting demand
centers to the closest facility are shaded according to their contribution to the distance cost,
with darker lines being more expensive assignments than lighter ones.
The player has control over whether facilities are opened at each of the demand centers.
Whenever a failure occurs, the player must reassign orphaned demand centers to another functioning facility, in order to maintain a complete solution. The game is made up of a succession
of short levels, progressing from tutorial levels meant to teach players the mechanics of the
game, to scenarios based on real problem instances, where their performance is recorded and
used to construct a solution.
The player toggles whether a facility is open at a given demand center by tapping on a spot.
To connect an orphaned demand center to a new facility, the player drags their finger from a
square to a spot, drawing a line between them.
The game is implemented in the Python programming language, using Kivy [25], a framework for multi-touch applications. Playtesting was performed on an iPad, since the interface
was designed with direct manipulation in mind.
From the data gathered in a pilot test of the game, we were able to approximate the Pareto
set for the Swain [26] and London [27] datasets, approaching, and in some cases outperforming,
a genetic algorithm. Figure 2, taken from [28], shows the comparison between the Pareto set
obtained for distance before failures by the human players, and the algorithmic approach.

2.2

Serious game for refugee aid deployment

The serious video game focused on the refugee situation simulation is played from the perspective of policy makers, giving the player control over refugee camps and their management. The
objective is to find configurations that minimize the cost function, while avoiding situations
that the player considers undesirable. While some game actions available to players are carried
over directly from the original RFLP game, others are more specific to the refugee simulation.
The player, as in the original game, has contol over opening or closing facilities at eligible
locations. The need to manage the simulation of a refugee situation introduces new mechanics:
players are able to modify the capacity of individual facilities, in order to expand or reduce the
amount of people that they can support and observing the consequences of such a policy in the
overall budget and living condition metrics; and players may set movement policies, aimed at
moving some part of the population from one facility to another.
Internally, Flee is used to compute the location of every refugee at every timestep (see [3]
for details). Like the RFLP game, Flee is written in Python, which makes the communication
between the two components straightforward. While the code for the game manages the graphics
and interaction, Flee performs the simulation itself.

a square representing a refugee camp is scaled according to its population capacity. These
elements are shown overlaid on a map of the country or region in which the particular crisis

sponding location. Using this panel, the player can increase or decrease the refugee population
capacity at that location. A camp may by closed by lowering the capacity to zero. A red badge
indicates refugee camps that are overpopulated, which would indicate a negative impact on the
quality of life of its inhabitants. By using the ”move” button, the players may put in place a
movement policy in order to shift the population from one location to another.
Figure 4 shows the proposed interface for the game, displaying data from the 2015 crisis in
Burundi [29].

Conclusions and Future work

We have presented the design for a video game aimed at optimizing the efficiency of humanitarian organizations at providing aid during refugee crises. Simply by playing the game, the player
is able to explore the possible actions that could be taken and policies that could be enacted,
and watch their consequences as the situation evolves. In doing so, we have formulated the
problem of refugee aid deployment as a softly capacitated, dynamic and robust facility location
problem.
Beyond individual exploration of scenarios, as the simulation becomes more sophisticated
and realistic, this game has potential for use as a demonstration of real world scenarios and for
training people in the enterprise of humanitarian logistics.
Even though the situations represented in the game are highly complex, we believe the
design of the game is simple enough it can be used to find approximate solutions even when
used by untrained individuals as we did with the original RFLP game.
