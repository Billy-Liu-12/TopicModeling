with the limitation of small-amplitude motion, which is a necessity under the assumption of
linearized quasi-steady motion. In a thrust-generating scenario, von Karman and Burgers [34]
noted that the resulting wake-vortices would appear in a ‘reverse’ Karman vortex street pattern.
For foils oscillating perpendicular to the direction of motion, dye-visualizations in water tunnels
have been used to identify the dependence of thrust-generation on the Strouhal number and the
angle of attack [28, 20]. Certain experimental studies have also relied on soap-films for wakevisualization of oscillating foils [23, 1]. The transition from a drag- to a thrust-producing regime
is often identified as the point when the vortex-pattern in the wake switches from a regular to
a reverse Karman vortex street. Such studies have also been performed numerically, using
inviscid panel-vortex method [15], and using 2D [21, 35, 1] and 3D [33] Navier-Stokes solvers.
Experimental studies have also been conducted for the case of pure pitching motion [8, 18], and
indicate that thrust-type wakes may exist for certain oscillation angles and frequencies.
In this paper, we investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of flapping airfoils, by combining numerical simulations with multi-objective optimization algorithms. Two potentially
conflicting goals, namely, the average speed and the Cost of Transport (or CoT, which measures the energy spent for travelling a unit-distance) are considered. Both these objectives are
critical for the survival of most swimming and flying organisms, in addition to being extremely
important metrics for gauging the performance of mechanical devices. Section 2 provides a brief
description of the numerical methods used in the simulations, as well as an introduction to the
multi-objective optimization algorithm used. The mechanism of thrust-generation in the case
of a purely heaving airfoil is examined in Section 3.1, and results obtained via the optimization
procedure are presented in Section 3.2, followed by concluding remarks in Section 4.

Methods

Simulation software. We use an open source fluids solver, ‘MRAG-I2D’ [26], to conduct
numerical simulations of heaving airfoils. The code is capable of simulating two-dimensional,
viscous, incompressible flows on multi-core architectures. The use of multi-resolution grids,
capable of adapting automatically in both space and time, enables accurate simulations while
keeping both computational cost and memory requirement low. The parallel implementation
of the multi-objective optimization algorithms is based on the TORC task-parallel library [13].
TORC provides a programming and runtime environment similar to OpenMP tasks, but allows
parallel programs to run on both shared and distributed memory systems. MPI applications run
on the compute nodes with one or more workers, and can submit tasks for asynchronous execution from any nesting level of parallelism. TORC has already been used for the parallelization
of algorithms for single objective stochastic optimization and uncertainty quantification algorithms, as part of the ⇧4U [12] framework.

Numerical methods. The solver used in the present study is based on the remeshed vortex
methods [19], and has been validated and used extensively for simulations of complex static as
well as deforming objects [10, 11, 32]. The velocity field in the simulations is governed by the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:

235–244

The interaction between fluid-flow and solid objects is achieved via Brinkman penalization [3],
which leads to a modified form of the vorticity equation:
@!
+ (u · r)! = ⌫r2 ! + λr ⇥ (χ (us − u))
@t

(3)

Here, λ is a penalty parameter, and χ is the characteristic function describing the distribution
of the solid object on a the Cartesian fluid-grid. The symbol us in Eq. 3 denotes the pointwise
velocity of the discretized solid, and accounts for translation, rotation, and deformation of the
body. Further details regarding spatial discretization, fluid-solid interaction, and the timesplitting steps involved in solving Eq. 3 are provided in refs. [10, 26].
Optimization objectives. There are two distinct objectives that we optimize the oscillating airfoils for, namely, maximizing the average horizontal speed, and minimizing the energy
consumed for travelling a unit distance (also referred to as the Cost of Transport). The CoT
is measured as the ratio of total work done for vertical and rotational oscillation of the airfoils,
to the total horizontal distance travelled:
Rt
(Fy uy + ⌧↵)
˙ dt
(4)
CoT (t) = 0 R t
u dt
0 x

Here, Fy is the negative of the flow-induced force acting on the airfoil in the vertical direction,
and ⌧ is the negative of the flow-induced torque. uy represents the imposed sinusoidal vertical
velocity, and ↵˙ is the imposed sinusoidal angular velocity (which is zero in the case of purelyheaving airfoils). ux denotes horizontal velocity, which is an outcome of the interaction between
the oscillating foil and the fluid-flow. The average horizontal speed and the CoT comprise the
‘fitness’ values used for the multi-objective optimization algorithm, which is described below.

Optimization algorithm. Evolutionary-optimization algorithms are designed to mimic the
rules of evolution in biology, and involve the processes of mutation, reproduction, and selection.
These strategies operate on a collection of individuals to iteratively improve the population with
respect to a certain ‘fitness’ value, which represents the eligibility of a particular individual to
pass on its characteristics to future generations. The particular algorithm that we use in this
study is referred to as the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) [7]. This
algorithm improves on the original NSGA [31] by introducing elitism, the crowding distance parameter, and a fast non-dominated sorting algorithm. A description of the NSGA-II procedure
is provided in Algorithm 1. The crossover step of the algorithm is performed using Simulated
Binary Crossover (SBX), whereas Parameter-based Mutation (PBM) is used for the mutation
step [6].

Results
Dynamics of a Purely Heaving Airfoil

In this section, we examine the dynamics of an airfoil undergoing a pure heaving motion. A
sinusoidal velocity is imposed on a NACA0012 airfoil in the vertical direction, and the angle of
attack is held fixed at zero (↵ = 0). The goal is to provide a more detailed understanding of
flow-induced thrust generation, than is possible by examining the reverse von Karman street,
or by examining the momentum excess/deficiency in the wake.

Figure 1 shows the vorticity-field generated by the oscillating airfoil at two points in time
during initial acceleration, along with the flow-induced force-distribution on the airfoil’s surface.
The corresponding time-series plots showing the variation of airfoil speed, flow-induced force,
power input, and the CoT are provided in Fig. 2. We note that all the airfoils described in
this study start from rest, and there is no inflow imposed at any time. At t = 1.33, the airfoil
is moving vertically upward with high velocity, as illustrated by the uy curve in Fig. 2a (red
diamond). The resulting fluid-induced force impedes this motion (negative Fy , Fig. 2b), and
leads the imposed uy by a phase angle of ⇡/2 throughout the simulation. A large amount of
work is put into moving the airfoil at this instance, as indicated by the positive peak in Fig. 2c.
Interestingly, this gives rise to very large forward thrust, as can be surmised from the positive
peak in Fx (Fig. 2b). The origin of this thrust is evident in Figs. 1a and 1b; the vortices shed
near the leading edge (Fig. 1a) generate a low pressure region, which gives rise to horizontal
acceleration-forces (Fig. 1b) on the airfoil’s surface.

and (d) the CoT computed at any particular instance as work/distance over the previous time
period.

The next instance we examine, at t = 2.0, corresponds to zero forward-thrust on the airfoil.
At this point, the airfoil has come to a vertical stop (uy = 0), and vortex-shedding occurs
aft of the leading edge (Fig. 1c). The resulting low-pressure region reduces the net vertical
fluid-induced force, but there is no assistance to the forward motion of the airfoil (Fx = 0 in
Fig. 2b). Practically all the force-vectors in Fig. 1d point in the vertical direction. We remark
that the temporal frequency associated with ux and Fx in Figs. 2a and 2b, is twice the imposed
frequency of the airfoil (which is the same as the frequency of uy and Fy ). This is expected,
since the symmetric airfoil encounters the same absolute conditions every half a period of the
vertical oscillation (except during initial startup), but with the opposite sign.
As the simulation progresses, the increasing speed of the airfoil gives rise to higher viscousand pressure-drag. The airfoil keeps speeding up, until the thrust force generated by the
Katzmayr e↵ect is balanced by drag forces (around t = 8.0 in Fig. 2a). Beyond this point, the
mean Fx and Fy values approach zero (Fig. 2b), and the airfoil maintains a steady mean speed.
The CoT also approaches a steady value (Fig. 2d), which is smaller than the transient values
measured during the start-up phase. We examine two particular instances during this steady
phase, corresponding to maximum thrust (t = 9.0) and maximum drag (t = 9.5) experienced by
the airfoil. The relevant flow-field and the surface force-distributions are shown in Fig. 3. At t =
9.0, the airfoil reaches its maximum oscillation displacement, and stops moving vertically. At
this point, the flow is mainly head-on with respect to the airfoil (i.e., zero angle of attack), which
gives rise to drag force at the leading edge (force vectors pointing aft - Fig. 3b). Meanwhile,
the airfoil attains its maximum upward speed at t = 9.5, and a low pressure region forms on
the lower surface near the leading edge. The gives rise to acceleration-inducing forces, as can
be seen in Fig. 3d (force vectors pointing-forward).

Optimal Heaving Motion

In this section, we will discuss the optimal oscillatory motion discovered by the optimization
algorithm. A purely-heaving motion is considered, with the optimization parameters being
the heave amplitude (Ah ) and frequency (fh ). The Pareto front, which depicts the tradeo↵
between speed and CoT amongst the fittest individuals found by the optimization algorithm,
is shown in Fig. 4. We clearly observe that faster individuals (which correspond to increasingly
negative speed, since the optimization algorithm acts as minimizer) tend to incur a significantly
higher cost for travelling a unit distance. On the other hand, the individuals attempting to
minimize CoT tend to be extremely slow. A compromise between speed and CoT may be
reached by selecting an individual which shows a balanced performance with respect to both
these quantities. The performance of various optimal individuals is discussed below.
To inspect the impact of optimization on aerodynamic performance, we select three distinct
individuals from the Pareto front in Fig. 4, one from either extreme (i.e., maximum speed, and
maximum CoT), and one with intermediate values for both speed and CoT (a ‘generalist’ foil).
The time-varying horizontal speeds and CoT of these three individuals are compared in Fig. 5.
We observe that the fastest individual dominates the other two in terms of speed (Fig. 5a),
but requires approximately 2 orders of magnitude more energy than the generalist foil, and 3

individuals are shown in Fig. 6, and in supplementary Movie 1.
In Fig. 7, we examine how the two optimization-parameters, Ah and fh , vary for the individuals lying on the Pareto front. The individuals are arranged in order of increasing efficiency,
such that individual 1 is the least efficient, but the fastest one. We observe that the fast individuals tend to employ larger heaving amplitudes, with the value of Ah decreasing steadily from
approximately 0.9 chord lengths to 0.5, for more efficient individuals. Similarly, the heaving
frequency decreases from approximately 0.6 Hz to 0.1 Hz. The results indicate that airfoils
must oscillate faster and with larger amplitudes to generate increased thrust via the Katzmayr

Conclusion

We have analyzed the motion of flapping airfoils with the help of numerical simulations combined with multi-objective optimization. We investigated the dynamics of a symmetric airfoil
undergoing pure heaving motion, to examine the mechanism of thrust-generation via the Katzmayr e↵ect. We discovered that the majority of the thrust originates from the creation of low
pressure regions near the leading edge of the airfoil. We then identified the optimal heaving
amplitude and frequency for attaining two potentially conflicting objectives, namely high speed
and low energy expenditure, with the help of optimization algorithms. The results indicate
that airfoils must oscillate faster and with larger amplitudes to generate increased thrust via
the Katzmayr e↵ect, but at the expense of much higher energy expenditure. It may be feasible
to reduce energetic costs by using a judicious combination of heaving and pitching motion,
which will be a subject for future investigation. We expect that the results provided here will
serve as a starting point for investigating the physics of optimal flapping flight in birds and
insects.
