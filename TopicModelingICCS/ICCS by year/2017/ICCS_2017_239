1 Introduction
During transportation by pipeline, the natural gas is affected by several factors, such as hydraulic
frictional resistance, and thus, its pressure drops. The task of supplying energy for natural gas is
achieved by gas transmission station, in which centrifugal compressors are generally the core
equipment. So we must grasp the characteristics of centrifugal compressors and it is of great
importance to ensure safe operation of gas pipeline and realize energy saving. In the operation of gas
pipeline network, the expected flow rate or characteristics of pipeline system often changes. And the
centrifugal compressor is operated with pipeline system, and when the inlet conditions of compressor
alter, its characteristics change. The error of relevant performance parameters of compressors found
through the performance curves directly is about 20%.Therefore, it is necessary to study on more
accurate performance conversion methods of centrifugal compressor.
So far, several methods have been adopted to transform the performance curves of centrifugal
compressors, for example the experimental test, computational fluid dynamics(CFD) simulation and
similarity conversion. The experimental test[1]-[3]obtains performance parameters by experiment, and
the result is exact. However, we cannot get performance parameters under each condition, because the
operating conditions of pipeline system change from minute to minute. CFD simulation[2]-[6] can
simulate complex viscous unsteady flow and depict the internal flow of centrifugal compressor. But
this method is more suitable for researchers due to high demands on size of the main pats of
compressors and the complicated manipulation. And as one of the most convenient method and with
certain accuracy for performance conversion, similarity conversion[2]-[4],[7]-[11] is widely used in the
fields.
Similarity conversion of centrifugal compressors is based on affinity law. That is to say, if the flow
processes of the model and prototype are similar, the ratio of performance parameters (thermal
parameters, air flowing parameters and geometric parameters) is equal, and corresponding efficiency
and loss coefficient is the same. To achieve similarity of flow processes between the experimental
model and prototype, then require the following: geometric similarity, inlet velocity triangle's
similarity, equality of Mach number and Isentropic exponent. Nevertheless, it is difficult even
impossible to satisfy all four conditions in practical situations, and they can only satisfy part. So, in
order to keep the operation process of model approximate analogous to that of prototype, we have to
find out the inner links of these conditions, and then add some additional conditions. And generally,
the similarity conversion method of centrifugal compressors can be divided into two parts according to
the value of adiabatic index ( k ) and Mach number ( M 2u ). In this paper, if adiabatic index of

1975

prototype has the same value as its counterparts in model while Mach number do not, we call it the
first similarity conversion method; if corresponding adiabatic index and Mach number are both not
equal, then it is called the second similarity conversion method. This paper mainly studies the similar
process of the centrifugal natural gas compressor, which belongs to the latter.
The recent research[7]-[12] trend is that more and more factors have been considered, such as seal
clearance of the impeller eye, blade thickness and relative roughness on surface of flow channel, and
the revised coefficient has been proposed and the high performance software developed when doing
similarity conversion of centrifugal compressors. To increase the further accuracy of prediction, this
paper intends to give a detailed analysis on the second similarity conversion method, find out the main
source of errors and then correct them.

2 Similarity Conversion of Centrifugal Compressors
2.1 Introduction of Traditional Similarity Conversion Method
The second similarity conversion method of centrifugal compressor applies to the situation when
the working medium of the model differs from that of the prototype. To achieve similarity between
design and actual conditions, it is by keeping the specific volume ratio of inlet and outlet as follows

2.2 Similarity Conversion of Centrifugal Natural Gas Compressors
Based on Predictor-Corrector
There are several performance parameters of centrifugal compressor. However, not every
parameter matters equally for practical problems on engineering. What we are concerned about,
actually, are three parameters: outlet pressure, outlet temperature and poly tropic head of centrifugal
compressors. Now, we write down the calculation process of these three performance parameters as
follows (The formula of poly tropic head please refers to Eq.8).

pd   ps

Td  

(13)
(14)

From Eq.8, Eq.13 and Eq.14, it can be easily obtained that every equation involves the parameter
pressure ratio. That is to say, if we can improve the accuracy of pressure ratio, then the precision of
three performance parameters above will be correspondingly increased. Therefore, pressure ratio is the
key parameter to the second similarity conversion of centrifugal compressors. And in the process of
the second similarity conversion, the key parameter is given by the assumption (Eq.1) , which has its
own scope of application--adiabatic index is approximately the same. But in practice, it can't satisfy
the assumption totally. Thus, we guess this is where the main source of errors.
With the first similarity conversion, we give a detailed analysis on two similarity conversion.
Further studies on the specific process show that, there are significant differences on the solution of
key parameter between these two methods. In the first similarity conversion, the value of speed is
generally given directly, and then the pressure ratio is determined; while the solution to the second is a
completely opposite process: Define the relation of the pressure ratio, and then calculate the value of
speed. The features of two similarity conversion methods are shown in Table 1.

Table1:The features of two similarity conversion methods

From Table 1, we try to propose a new prediction method combined the advantages of two
methods. For the first similarity conversion, there are several calculation methods to gain pressure
ratio, and we can calculate it in constant volume process, isothermal process, adiabatic process and
polytropic process. Among them, the most accuracy method is calculating it in polytropic process,
which is fundamental and applied to various kinds of gas. The process of calculation is as follows.
The parameter pressure ratio can be obtained from Eq.7 - 9 that

Compared with the supplementary condition of the second similarity conversion (Eq.2), it can be
found that the value of pressure ratio calculated by Eq.15 is more accurate. Now, introduce the idea of
predictor-corrector. First of all, we use Eq.2 to define the initial value of the pressure ratio. And then,
calculate the parameter speed by using Eq.10. Last, revise the pressure ratio by Eq.15. And the
concrete steps of the second similarity conversion are as follows.
Step1. Calculate the physical parameters (density, adiabatic index, etc)of gas with BWRS
equations.
Step2. Compare the value of adiabatic index of gas according to Step1. If adiabatic components of
two kinds of gas are equal, choose the first similarity conversion and if not, choose the second one.
Step3. Use Eq.2 to give the initial value of pressure ratio, and it is the predictor of pressure ratio.
Step4. Calculate the parameter speed by using Eq.10.
Step5. Revise pressure ratio by Eq.15, and it is the correction value of pressure ratio.
Step6. Gain other parameters of centrifugal compressors.

pipeline. The inlet temperature of the compressor is 45℃ and the inlet pressure is 8.101MPa. The

In this case, we calculated the main performance parameters of the centrifugal compressor under
105 different inlet conditions by the second similarity conversion and the similar conversion based on
predictor-corrector. Now, we picked 30 inlet conditions at random. To verify the assumption of the
second similarity conversion (Eq.1), compare the ratio of specific volume between inlet and outlet of
compressor under design conditions and actual conditions, and it was shown in Fig.3. From Fig.3, it
could be seen that the difference of the ratio of specific volume existed between these two conditions,
which proved that the correction was reasonable.

Fig.7 Comparison of T
From Fig.4-7, the parameter outlet pressure of centrifugal compressors calculated by the second
similarity conversion was about 0.4-0.5MPa higher than field data and the relative error was about 6%,
and outlet temperature was generally 6-7 ℃ higher, while for the second similarity conversion based
on predictor-corrector, the value of the outlet pressure was 0.2MPa higher, the relative error about 2%,
outlet temperature 2-3 ℃ higher. Therefore, the latter was more effective, which greatly improved the
accuracy of performance conversion of natural gas compressors.

4 Conclusion
In this manuscript, we have reviewed the second similarity conversion method, gave an analysis on
the process, and based on the idea of predictor-corrector, proposed a similarity conversion method of
centrifugal natural gas compressors. By using the present method, the error of parameters of the
natural gas centrifugal compressor was greatly reduced. The conclusions were stated as follows:
(1) There existed the difference of the ratio of specific volume between design conditions and
actual conditions.
(2) With the second similarity conversion based on predictor-corrector, the outlet pressure
calculated was 0.2MPa higher than field data, and the relative error was about 2%.
(3) With the second similarity conversion based on predictor-corrector, the outlet temperature was
2-3 ℃ higher than field data.
