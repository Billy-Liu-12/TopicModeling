whereby small radioactive “seeds” are permanently or temporarily implanted into the prostate.
These treatments typically target the entire prostate gland and may damage the urethra (which
passes through the prostate), the rectum (which sits below the prostate) and/or the nerves that
run alongside the prostate and are essential for erectile function.
This “whole gland” approach to treatment has been necessary because accurately localising
and targeting tumours within the prostate has previously been very difficult. Advances in
imaging and treatment delivery now make it possible to accurately treat sub-volumes of the
prostate and thus limit damage to the healthy surrounding tissues [19]. This treatment approach
is commonly referred to as “focal therapy”, and permanently implanting radioactive I-125 seeds
into these sub-volumes has been proposed as an effective form of treatment to maintain high
rates of tumour control whilst minimising treatment side effects [13].
Previous research by the authors has demonstrated that, with knowledge of the specific
biology of the tumour, radiation dose distributions can be planned which optimise tumour
control and minimise treatment side effects [11, 10]. Furthermore, these treatment plans can
be generated using a fast optimisation algorithm [3, 12]. The plans generated describe precise
locations within the prostate for radioactive seed implantation. These seeds are implanted
under ultrasound guidance, however, whilst implantation may be precise, the seeds can migrate
from their implanted position as a result of tissue swelling and bleeding. With this migration
brings the risk of ineffective treatment due to underdosing of the tumour and/or overdosing
of the healthy tissue. Accordingly, that original research is now extended. It is shown how,
using a convolved dose model, robust focal therapy plans can be developed which preserve
treatment efficacy and reduce radiation dose to organs at risk even under post-operative seed
displacement. These can be rapidly generated, enabling them to be developed at the time the
radioactive seeds are surgically implanted.
The following section describes the prostate brachytherapy procedure, and summarises the
assumptions and constraints for automatic seed plan generation. Convolution of the dose rate
function is outlined in Section 3. This is followed by computational experiments and discussion
of the results, including their implication for clinicians.

2.1

Background
Prostate Brachytherapy

Transperineal implantation of radioactive seeds under ultrasound guidance is a common form
of treatment for low risk prostate cancer [6]. The procedure requires an ultrasound probe to be
placed in the rectum and needles, containing strands of radioactive seeds, are inserted through
the holes of a template placed on the perineam, as shown in Figure 1. The ultrasound probe
guides the depth of penetration into the prostate. Treatment planning, prior to implantation,
requires capture of ultrasound images in 5mm increments, from the base of the prostate (which
sits adjacent to the bladder) to the apex. These ultrasound images capture the size and shape
of the prostate relative to the template grid which is used to guide needle insertion.
A treatment plan is generated such that radioactive seed placement meets local treatment
planning objectives. These planning objectives define the minimum radiation dose that should
be delivered to the target (commonly the whole prostate gland) that will also meet radiation
dose constraints that will minimise the harm to normal tissues [6]. Using this technique, the
radioactive seeds remain in place indefinitely and the radiation dose rate declines slowly as a
result of the radioactive decay of the I-125 sources.
In conventional, whole gland brachytherapy, a safety margin is added to the prostate boundary to account for the likelihood of seed movement or migration after implantation. This margin,

which is typically 0 − 5 mm, creates a Planning Treatment Volume (PTV). This margin around
the prostate results in irradiation of the normal surrounding tissue but is necessary to avoid
the risk of underdosing the prostate if a seed migrates away from the prostate boundary. In
practice, seeds typically migrate from their intended position in a random fashion and as such
can equally move into normal tissues increasing the risk of toxicity.

The approach presented in this publication considers the possibility of random displacement
of each individual seed to minimise the risk of both underdosing the target volume (which is
the prostate in whole gland therapy, or the tumour in focal therapy) and overdosing the organs
at risk (the urethra and rectum). The treatment planning objectives are based on a biological
model that takes into account the radiosensitivity of the tumour cells, the tumour cell density
and other features of the tumour that may determine the need for high doses of radiation such
as the aggressiveness of the tumour [11] This biological model determines a Tumour Control
Probability (TCP) value which is a relative measure of the likelihood of disease control following
a given dose of radiation. Due to uncertainties in the model parameters, a TCP value can only
be considered in a relative sense. However, it was shown by Haworth et al, that a TCP value
of 0.62 results in a high likelihood of tumour control at 5 years post treatment [11] This value
was derived from the post-operative distribution of real seeds that were implanted at positions
according to a treatment plan and then displaced due to normal tissue effects such as swelling
and bleeding. To achieve a TCP value of 0.62, a treatment plan must be created that accounts
for seed migration, and thus a target higher than this must be set during planning. It has been
previously shown by the authors that seed displacements can be modelled and how treatment
plans can be created that take into account seed migration [3, 12].

Automatic Treatment Planning

Prostate Structure and Dose Calculations:
• The prostate is modelled within a bounding volume (planning grid) consisting of voxels:
x = 5, y = 5, z = 5mm, labelled according to tissue type: prostate, rectum, urethra, PTV.

Betts et al.

• The tumour cell density of each voxel is assigned one of five values according to tumour
location statistics determined by Zeng et al. [10, 21].
• The objective function is TCP. The calculation is given in [3], using radiation dose rate
function Equation 1, based on voxels of x = 2, y = 2, z = 5mm.
Seed Placement Constraints:
• Seed placement and radiation dose conform with the American Brachytherapy Society
(ABS) recommendations [6].
• Seeds can only be placed at points spaced 5mm apart in each of the x, y and z axes, no
two seeds can be on adjacent points, all seeds must be within the planning target volume
(PTV), no seeds can be in the central column (which aligns with the urethra), no seeds
can be placed between the PTV and rectum.
• The proportion of the urethra receiving a dose of more than 217Gy, (150% of the conventional dose of 145Gy) was constrained to 10% of the urethral volume. The rectal volume
receiving 145 Gy was constrained to 2cc, as per AAPM recommendations [15].

where SK is air-kerma strength, Λ is the dose-rate constant in water, gp (r) is the radial dose
function describing dose fall-off due to photon scattering and attenuation (excluding inverse
square law fall-off) and φan (r) is the one dimensional anisotropy function [16]. Since the
radioactive seeds are cylindrical with a radius of 1mm all dose rate calculations at distances of
of less than 1 mm are calculated at 1mm. The values gp (r) and φan (r) are obtained from the
Amersham model 6711 dosimetry dataset [16] for the seeds used in this study.
R(r) = SK · Λ ·

3.2

Post-Operative Seed Displacement

The post-operative displacement of the implanted seeds from their intended location has the
potential to significantly alter the actual radiation dose distribution throughout the prostate
and surrounding region from that planned [18, 2, 4]. This may reduce treatment effectiveness
and expose sensitive tissue to high levels of radiation, causing side effects such as urinary toxicity
and rectal bleeding. Previous research by the authors [3, 12] evaluated the post-operative seed
displacement for the patient data used in this study. This was found to be approximately
normally distributed in each of the x, y and z axes having mean 0 and standard deviation of
3.8mm. This accords with results obtained or reported by other researchers [7, 2, 4].
In the modelling that follows it is assumed that the post-operative displacement of a seed
is composed of three independent and normally distributed random variables, ex , ey and ez ,
having mean 0 and standard deviation σ. Thus, the error in the post-operative distance between
seed and target compared with the planned distance r (consisting of components rx , ry and rz
in each axis) for a given σ is

Planning Under Uncertainty

A planning model for prostate cancer brachytherapy that takes post-operative seed displacement
into account could potentially be achieved using stochastic optimisation. This would require
the expected TCP of a given seed configuration to be calculated by discrete-event simulation
using randomly perturbed seeds [8]. The incorporation of this step at each iteration would make
the calculation of the optimal expected TCP extremely computationally intensive. Although
the efficiency of the stochastic optimisation my be improved by methods such as stochastic
gradient-based approaches and metamodeling etc. [8, 17], the doubly exponential form of the
output function [3] and dimensionality of the problem limits the utility of these approaches. As
a consequence, stochastic modelling as it is traditionally performed is unsuitable in practical
settings, where dose planning interactively or intra-operatively requires short solution times.
For example, the non-stochastic method of [3] creates treatment plans in around 30 seconds;
clearly, a stochastic implementation of this method would have a computation time increased
proportionally to the number of trials pooled and evaluated at each iteration and even a small
sample size would make the method infeasible.
Because of these practical time constraints, researchers and practitioners have typically
used a deterministic approach for dose calculations during the planning process. This enables
effective plans to be produced within a practical time frame. The effect of post-operative
displacement on the actual treatment dose received by the patient can then be evaluated by
simulation modelling in order to verify that plans meet treatment dose requirements with a
certain reliability, for example [7, 18, 2, 4, 9, 12]. However, because these plans do not
explicitly incorporate the effect of post-operative seed displacement during the planning phase
they invariably over-estimate treatment dose, and under-estimate the radiation dose to organs
at risk actually received by the patient.
To address this limitation, the effect of post-operative seed displacement is approximated
during the optimisation by modelling the radiation dose distribution as though the seeds have
been perturbed. Although this new method is not a stochastic optimisation in its strictest sense
it reflects the effect of post-operative stochastic seed displacement on the actual radiation dose
delivered to the patient, and enables plans to be constructed with the same efficiency as the
original deterministic model.

3.4

Convolving The Radiation Dose Rate Function

The effect of post-operative seed displacement on the radiation dose received at a target is
incorporated into the optimisation model by replacing the radiation dose function, Equation 1,
by the convolution [5] of Equation 1 and the probability density function of the post-operative
seed displacement function, Err(r, σ), given by Equation 2. Because there is no tractable
algebraic form for the convolved dose rate function, it is calculated by evaluating the expected
dose rate for each combination of r and σ using simulation as described below.
Algorithm 1 works by first creating a point at random that is uniformly distributed over
a sphere of radius r [14]. This is then perturbed randomly in the x, y and z axes, reflecting normally distributed post-operative seed displacement having standard deviation σ. The
convolved dose corresponding to the original radius r is then calculated at this new point. Repeating this operation n times and averaging enables the expected convolved dose at a radius
r to be calculated at a level of accuracy determined by n.

TCP calculations in the experiments that follow were made using tabulated convolved dose
rate functions at discrete intervals of r ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 10} mm and σ = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5mm. To
create these, 1000 iterations of the algorithm were run at each parameter combination. Centered
moving average smoothing over r was used to eliminate small deviations from monotonicity.
Values of r between tablulated values were interpolated assuming a piecewise linearity. For
notational simplicity in the following, R refers to the original (unconvolved) dose rate function
in Equation 1, and C1, . . . , C5 refer to the convolved dose function at each value of σ.
Figure 2 shows the effect of the convolution on the original dose rate function evaluated at
varying levels of σ. It can be seen that close to the seed, the radiation dose is highly attenuated
due to the convolution, with larger values of σ resulting in a greater
√ flattening of dose. Because
seed planning constraints prevent two seeds being closer than 5 2 ≈ 7.1mm it is highly likely
the attenuation of dose rate at r closer than this has little effect on actual seed placement. At
values of r greater than ≈ 5mm it can be seen that the convolved dose rate function curves
cross, with those corresponding to larger values of σ becoming greater than those for smaller
values of σ. In the following section it will be shown that the effect of this is to increase the
distance between seeds slightly, on average, reducing the total number of needles required for
treatment planning.

Experiments and Results
Design of experiments

Patient Selection. Patient data used previously by the authors [3, 12], for which human
ethics approval had been obtained, was used in this study. Patient data consisted of a voxel
model of the prostate and surrounding tissue. Each voxel was classified according to tissue
type (prostate, urethra, rectum, PTV) with tumour cell density identified for each voxel of the
prostate.
Creation of Treatment Plans. To evaluate the effect of creating treatment plans using
the convolved dose rate model, multiple treatment plans were created for each patient at each
combination of: TCP Target Value: 0.85, 0.90 and 0.95, and Dose Rate Function: unconvolved
(R) and convolved for σ = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5mm.
The values of post-operative seed displacement (σ) encompass values likely to be encountered in practice [3, 4]. Target TCP values likewise represent those that could be realistically
considered by a practitioner intending to achieve a treatment TCP > 0.62 post-operatively, as
per [11]. Because the optimisation is non-deterministic, 10 plans were created for each patient
at each parameter combination.
Evaluation of Treatment Plans. In order to measure the performance of the treatment
plans under post-operative seed displacement, the seeds were perturbed, and the TCP and
radiation dose received by the rectum and urethra of the perturbed seed plans were measured.
σ values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5mm were again used to perturb the seeds as described in Section
3.2. 50 perturbed seed plans were analysed at each parameter combination (TCP and Dose
rate function) for each seed plan produced.

4.2

Properties of Convolved Dose Rate Plans

Table 1 shows the average number of seeds in each plan, the average distance of seeds from the
centroid, and the average distance between each seed and its nearest neighbour as a function
of TCP and dose distribution model used for optimisation. It can be seen that setting a higher
target TCP increases the number of seeds in the treatment plan. This is to be expected, since
additional radiation dose is required to increase TCP as a general principle. Using the convolved
dose rate model reduces the number of seeds in a plan for a given TCP compared with the
original (unconvolved) dose rate model. The number of seeds in each plan, on average, decreased
as the amount of post-operative seed displacement (σ) increased, to a limit of σ ≈ 4mm. The
reduction in seeds is explained by a small increase in the spread of seeds, shown by an increased
average distance from the centroid, and an increased distance between closest pairs of seeds as
σ increased.

Treatment Efficacy of Convolved Dose Rate Plans

The effectiveness of treatment plans is now assessed. The criteria for effectiveness are (a) the
potential to maintain a sufficiently high TCP, to treat the disease, even under post-operative
seed displacement, and (b), the protection of organs at risk - namely the urethra and rectum also under post-operative seed displacement.
Figure 3 shows TCP calculated for each planning target under each of the dose rate models,
and evaluated under post-operative seed displacement for σ = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5mm. Each
plot indicates TCP = 0.62 as Haworth et al. [10] identified this value as a predictor for treatment efficacy, whereby a TCP < 0.62 was associated with an unacceptably high probability of
treatment failure.
Regardless of the dose rate model used for planning, the results show that a high target TCP
needs to be chosen to preserve treatment reliability under post-operative seed displacement.
Of the parameters chosen for the experiments, it is only trials with a target TCP of 0.95
that maintain sufficiently high TCP levels under post-operative seed displacement to warrant
consideration for treatment planning. Increasing σ for the convolution model increases the
variance of treatment TCP under post-operative displacement. However, the results show that
when planning TCP = 0.95, all plans maintained lower quartile treatment TCP values greater
than 0.62 even under the most extreme post-operative displacement.

Figure 3: Treatment TCP as a function of Target TCP, dose rate model and post-operative
seed displacement
Figures 4 and 5 show the volume of rectum receiving 100% of the planning dose and the
proportion of the urethra receiving 150% of the planning dose respectively. These figures show
that plans made using the convolved dose rate function at increasing values of σ reduce the
radiation dose received by organs at risk under post-operative seed displacement. The figures
also show that increasing the Target TCP has only a small effect on the dose received by
the urethra and rectum. This means it is possible to aim for a high Target TCP without
fear of exposing organs at risk to undue radiation using focal therapy. The results also show
how a clinician could analyse the seed distribution, with and without the convolved dose-rate
function, to observe the relative change in TCP and dose to organs at risk. This would enable
an evaluation of implant quality in the individual patient prior to and during the treatment,
leading to increased confidence in using a focal planning approach.

Summary and Conclusion

This paper has presented a new radiation dose rate model for prostate cancer brachytherapy
treatment planning. This new dose rate model is created by convolving the theoretical dose
rate with the pdf of the function describing the post-operative displacement of the implanted
radioactive seeds from their intended location.
This convolved dose rate model allows treatment plans to be created which achieve a high
tumour control probability but result in reduced radiation dose to organs at risk. Furthermore,
these plans are created quickly, allowing the method to be used intra-operatively.
