cells as fluid-filled capsules surround by a single zero-thickness [13, 7] or finite thickness [6]
membrane. Simulations of red blood cells passing through a constricted microchannel have
been validated [20] and extensively studied (e.g., [14]). However, the discoidal shape, lack of
a nucleus, and high membrane incompressibility of red blood cells may preclude the direct
extension of their behaviour in constricted microchannels to eukaryotic cells.
Single membrane models have also been used to model eukaryotic cells [18, 12]. Recent
studies have sought to improve model fidelity for eukaryotes by explicitly including the nucleus
with a compound capsule model. In a compound capsule, the outer cell membrane and nuclear
lamina are modeled with two separate membranes. As opposed to the simple (single) capsule
used for red blood cells, the two membranes are uncoupled and may be modeled with different
physical properties. Luo et al used a front-tracking method to simulate the deformation of
an elastic compound capsule in shear flow [16]. These results were extended from initially
spherical to ellipsoidal compound capsules, the dynamics of which were investigated in depth
[15]. Similar compound models have been developed for vesicles [26, 11] and droplets [25, 29].
Initial applications have used compound capsules to simulate the passage of a eukaryote
through a constricted microchannel. Using dissipative particle dynamics, Xiao et al. showed
that a stiff inner membrane can preclude the passage of a compound capsule through a constriction [28]. Casquero et al. performed a two-dimensional simulation and observed deformation
of the inner membrane to be highest at the exit of the narrowed region [3]. However, only a
single, proof-of-concept compound capsule simulation was conducted in these studies.
Further, it is not well understood how the addition of a second membrane representing the
nucleus alters the computational cost or parallel performance of the fluid-structure interaction
(FSI) simulation, as previous performance studies have focused on red blood cells (e.g., [5, 23,
17]). Intuitively, the addition of a second membrane may increase FSI- and capsule-related
computation by as much as 100%. Further, compound capsules seem to require higher fluid
grid resolutions than simple capsules, even in shear flow [16]. These potential increases in
computational expense underscore the importance of efficient parallel codes for FSI.
HARVEY is a massively parallel computational fluid dynamics solver, focused on hemodynamics and based on the lattice Boltzmann method [21, 22]. In this paper, we integrate
HARVEY with FSI-functionality, using the immersed boundary method to couple a finite element model for deformable capsules to the fluid model. We discuss how the parallelization
strategy for the FSI framework builds on existing HARVEY parallelism. The code is used to
simulate passage of simple and compound capsules through a constricted microchannel, comparing results from simulations with and without an inner membrane to quantify the influence
of the ‘nucleus’ on capsule deformation during transit of the constriction. We study the dependence of compound capsule deformation on the capillary number and on the inner capsule’s
volume fraction. Finally, we evaluate the parallel performance of the FSI solver in this setting.

Methodology
Lattice Boltzmann

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a deterministic, mesoscopic approach to numerically
solve the Navier-Stokes equations [4]. The fluid is represented as a particle distribution function
fi (x, t), which denotes the number of particles at grid point x at time t with discrete velocity
ci . The evolution of distribution f is governed by the lattice Boltzmann equation,


fi (x + ci δt, t + δt) = fi (x, t) − Ω fi (x, t) − fieq (x, t) + δtFi (x, t).

for timestep δt, Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution function fieq , collision operator Ω,
and the distribution F corresponding to external force g being applied to the fluid. HARVEY
employs a standard implementation, with the D3Q19 discretization of velocity space, BGK
collision operator Ω = τ1 , and kinematic viscosity ν = c2s (τ − 12 ) with lattice speed of sound
cs = √13 . The halfway bounce-back boundary condition enforces the no-slip condition on the
geometry surface. Flow at the inlet and outlet of the geometry is governed by Zou-He boundary
conditions, with a fixed velocity profile at the inlet and a fixed pressure at the outlet [9].
We extend the collision kernel in previous HARVEY implementations to include an external
force distribution F derived from an external force g [8]. The external force is used in the
immersed boundary method to couple fluid and capsule dynamics, as discussed below. The
hydrodynamic moments, density ρ and momentum ρv, in this kernel are computed as

The velocity v is also used to compute the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution.

2.2

Capsule finite element model

Following the approach described by Luo et al. [16, 15], a cell with a nucleus is represented as
a compound capsule, with two zero-thickness membranes to represent the outer cell membrane
and nuclear lamina. The triangulated grid for each membrane is created by taking successive
subdivisions of an icosahedron, which produces favorable regularity and isotropy, and projecting
onto the capsule’s initially spherical shape [13]. The shear and dilational elastic responses to
strain of each membrane are governed by a Skalak constitutive law,
W =


G 2

(4)

for strain invariants I1 , I2 , shear elastic modulus G, and the ratio of dilational to shear elastic
moduli C = 1 [27]. A simple C 0 finite element model is used to compute the membrane forces
G from the strain energy function [24]. In this study, we assume that modulus G is identical
for the inner and outer membranes. For compound capsules, the size of the inner membrane is
described by the volume fraction φ, equal to the volume ratio of the inner membrane to the outer
membrane. A penalty force fp is applied to enforce a constant capsule volume; the resulting
volume variation is less than 1% for either membrane during all subsequent simulations.

2.3

Immersed boundary

The immersed boundary method (IBM) handles the FSI of the capsule and fluid by coupling the
finite element model for the capsule (defined on a Lagrangian grid) with the lattice Boltzmann
method (defined on an Eulerian grid) [19]. Using a discrete delta function δ to transfer physical
values between the two grids, IBM approximately enforces the no-slip condition on the capsule
surface and allows the capsule to exert a force on the surrounding fluid. In our implementation,
there are three components of the IBM: spreading, interpolation, and updating.

The force G defined on the capsule vertex X is spread onto the fluid grid by the equation

and fluid velocity v is updated with the lattice Boltzmann algorithm. In the interpolation step,
the updated velocity V of the capsule vertex X is computed at time t + δt with the sum

V(X, t + δt) =

Finally, the position of the capsule vertex is updated using the no-slip condition:

using the spatial step δx of the fluid grid. A general discussion of the coupling of LBM and
finite element methods with IBM may be found in [13].

2.4

Parallelism

The lattice Boltzmann algorithm is parallelized in HARVEY with MPI, with the simulation
domain decomposed into bounding boxes belonging to each task. Communication between
tasks occurs on the overlapping halo around each task’s bounding box. Data is transferred on
these halo regions between neighboring tasks using non-blocking MPI calls. Indirect addressing
is used to limit the required memory, as vascular geometries often occupy a small percentage of
their bounding box volume. Global communication is not required and the lattice Boltzmann
algorithm in HARVEY scales up to 1.5 million tasks [21, 22].
We extend this parallel paradigm to the coupled LBM-IBM-FEM framework for FSI. The
overlapping halo is set to half of the support of the delta function (2 grid points). The capsule
workload is distributed on two levels, by capsule and by vertex, similar to the approach in [17].
First, each capsule is owned by the task to which its center belongs and this task is responsible
for computing forces from the finite element model on the capsule. Second, each vertex X
belongs to the task in which it is located and this task interpolates the velocity V of the vertex.
The other immersed boundary functions, updating and spreading, are not fully parallelized, in
order to minimize communication. MPI communication is used to collect velocities V from all
tasks owning vertices X of a capsule to the task which owns the capsule, and to send force G
at each vertex from the task owning the capsule to the tasks owning each vertex. We do not
alter the load balancing methodology in HARVEY to account for FSI; it remains based on the
fluid grid alone, as described in [22].

abruptly started simple shear flow is compared with the method of Luo et al. [16]. Deformation

minor axes L and B, respectively, of the ellipsoid with the same moment of inertia. Figure 1 shows the deformation in time of compound capsules with volume fraction φ = 0.05

shear flow, the capillary number is defined

elements. The Eulerian fluid grid resolution

sults generally agree well and show the slight
transient fluctuations reported by [16].

3.2

Constriction passage

We study the transit of a compound capsule through a microchannel constriction. A
range of constriction geometries exist in the
literature, with varied cross-sectional shapes
[30] and with lengths ranging from 2 to more
than 50µms [28, 12]. For this study, the constricted channel is rectangular and the 6µm
length is comparable to the 8µm capsule diameter. Depicted in profile in figure 2, the
channel is 16µm high, the transverse direction
(not shown) is 16µm deep, and the constriction height is 6µm. Further, the channel has Figure 2: Central region of constricted mia 4µm slope in the axial direction between crochannel. Vertical lines indicate the boundary

no-slip. Initially spherical capsules with a diameter of 8µm must deform to transit the constriction. The fixed inflow is 2.21 × 10−6 mL/s,
corresponding to a parabolic flow with a maximum velocity u0 = 0.025m/s at the inlet. The
fluid is characterized by Reynolds number Re = 0.1, dynamic viscosity µ = 1cP, and LBM
0
relaxation time τ = 1. The capillary number is defined as Ca = µu
G .
To determine the appropriate simulation resolution, figure 3 shows the deformation D of a
simple capsule with Ca = 0.5. Corresponding images of the capsule are illustrated in figure
4. Simulations with Eulerian fluid grid resolutions of 150µm and 200µm agree well over the
course of the passage, while 5120 triangular elements for the capsule grid resolve the higher
curvature regions in the constriction. Subsequent simulations are conducted at 150µm fluid
grid resolution with 5120 elements to represent each capsule membrane.
Figure 4 compares simple and a compound capsules (φ = 0.125) with Ca = 0.5. Starting
from a spherical shape, the simple capsule begins to develop a protrusion on the leading side

during the entry into the narrowing. Within
the constriction, the capsule shape is heavily deformed and becomes approximately discoidal with a bulbous leading side. The bulbous region continues to expand upon exit of
the constriction, before recovering the familiar
‘parachute’-like shape. These qualitative aspects for simple capsules are consistent with
simulations in a shorter constriction [28].
At this relatively high capillary number, the
shape of the outer membrane in a compound
capsule remains similar to simple capsules, except for the indentation at the trailing side in
the constriction. The outer and inner mem- Figure 3: Deformation D as a function of axial

and transit phases, but take on very different
shapes in the exit phase. The outer membrane become nearly spherical on the leading side,
while indentation on the trailing side becomes more pronounced. Meanwhile, the inner mem-

brane deforms to a more discoidal shape, inclined perpendicular to the direction of flow. The
resulting shape of the inner membrane leads to a second peak in D, as shown in figure 5 for
Ca = 0.5. Simulations at lower Ca indicate that maximum deformation of the inner membrane
occured near the exit of the narrowing, but a second peak in deformation was not discussed [3].
After passing the narrowed region, the deformation D of the two membranes in the compound
capsule becomes similar again.
The deformation of a given capsule in the constriction depends on the capillary number
Ca. In figure 6, maximum capsule deformation is plotted as a function of Ca for simple and
compound capsules with volume fraction φ = 0.125. The outer membrane of the compound
capsule deforms less than the corresponding simple capsule over the entire range of Ca considered, as previously observed for compound capsules in shear flow [16] and optical tweezing
simulations [10]. The outer membrane deforms more than the inner membrane at Ca = 0.3,

but this relationship reverses at higher Ca. Indeed, the deformation of the inner membrane
approaches the corresponding simple capsule
as Ca → 1. This ‘crossover’ point between
larger inner and outer membrane deformation
is remarkably consistent with results from shear
flow at a similar volume fraction [16].
The passage of the compound capsule
through the constriction also depends on volume fraction φ. For Ca = 0.5, we consider inner
membranes with radii of 2, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5µm,
corresponding to φ = 0.125, 0.244, 0.422, and
0.67. The maximum deformation of the inner Figure 5: Deformation of simple and comand outer membranes in the constriction are pound capsules with Ca = 0.5 and φ = 0.125.
shown in figure 6, while the corresponding capsule images at this location are depicted in figure 7. While membrane deformation is similar at
φ = 0.125, the inner membrane is more heavily deformed at higher φ. However, as φ becomes
large, the flow field between the two membranes is not sufficient to cause further deformation of
the outer membrane, and inner membrane deformation becomes intuitively limited. Overall, we
find that both the shape and deformation of inner and outer membranes depends significantly
on the volume fraction.

3.3

Influence on computational profile

The simulation of compound, rather than simple, capsules requires additional computational
expense. To assess our parallel framework, we study the strong scaling of simple and compound capsules in the constricted microchannel. To emphasize FSI components, we simulate
81 capsules with 4µm outer membrane diameters spread throughout the geometry, at the same
numerical capsule and fluid resolutions discussed above. While the problem size is too small
for large-scale computation, performance in this setting is nonetheless of interest. Results are
presented in figure 8 up to 64 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/Q system Vulcan at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. Total runtime scales somewhat better for simple capsules,
performing at 81% parallel efficiency at 8 cores and 58% at 64 cores, versus 77% and 51% for
compound capsules at the same core counts.

Figure 8: (left) Strong scaling of simulations with simple and compound capsules. (right)
Maximum and average task efficiency for FSI-related computation with compound capsules.
The performance loss with capsules is primarily due to two factors: the load imbalance of
the FSI-related computation and the small problem size. We define FSI-related computation
as the contributions of the immersed boundary and finite element models, along with the
related MPI communication. Load balance challenges have been discussed in previous FSI
frameworks, such as [5] and [17]. Figure 8 shows that average FSI-related computation for
compound capsules remains at 80% efficiency at 64 processors. However, this work is not welldistributed and the overall FSI-related efficiency is reduced to approximately 48%. However, as
simple capsules require approximately half the FSI-related computation of compound capsules,
they have slightly better strong scaling. Additionally, the small problem size limits parallel
performance: at 64 cores, every capsule is shared by multiple tasks and the parallel overhead
becomes large relative to the computation time. In contrast, [17] demonstrated superior strong
scaling over a much larger problem size.

Conclusion

In this study, we present a framework for conducting FSI simulations of cells in flow. This
framework builds on a massively parallel hemodynamics application, HARVEY, and is based

on the lattice Boltzmann and immersed boundary methods. Eukaryotic cells are represented as
compound capsules with a standard finite element model. The parallelization scheme for the
FSI-related computation builds on existing HARVEY parallelism.
We apply the resulting computational framework to simulate deformation of simple and
compound capsules through a constricted microchannel. Results are consistent with the extensive study by Luo et al. [16] in shear flow: (1) at a given capillary number, the maximum
deformation of a simple capsule is higher than that of the compound capsule’s outer membrane
and (2) the volume fraction of the inner membrane has a strong influence on the shape and
deformation of the outer membrane. Further, we observe that the inner membrane undergoes
two deformations to discoidal shapes: first, aligned with the direction of flow in the constriction
and, second, perpendicular to the flow direction at the exit of the channel narrowing.
In a strong scaling test of the computational framework, we observe that the additional
membrane in compound capsules reduces parallel performance, due to the more limited parallelism and load balance of the FSI model. In future work, we aim to improve performance with
static and dynamic load balancing of FSI-related computation to solve large-scale problems.
