petroleum resources from reservoirs. Water content of produced liquid in onshore oilfields nowadays
is usually higher than before, especially in China and Russia, and the petroleum exploitation in
extended potential regions of the ocean area also lack water separation in wellhead oil due to cost
reasons, which lead to wide exist of oil and water two phase flow in oil gathering and transferring
device and this phenomena is inevitable.
However, the presence of oil and water two phase flow in storage and transporting facilities may
make chemical and electrochemical corrosion intensifies worse and bring a series of risk of oil
resource loss, environmental pollution and public safety endanger, as well as the loss in economy and
safety in crude oil trading and refining. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out oil and water separation
in the process of storage and transportation, and the analysis and research of oil and water two phase
flow is the basis of high efficient oil and water separation. Currently, the research method based on
flow pattern is deficient in fuzzy, quantitative and non-uniform definition of pattern, which requires
the study on direct numerical simulation of oil and water two phase flow.
The main reason of wide application of experimental methods and empirical formula is that they
are easy to implement, robust to different cases and fast to get the result. As a result, if we want to
apply the CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) based research methods, it’s essential to ensure the
robustness and efficiency of our algorithm and then make it easy to perform.
In this paper, we develop an algorithm to simulate droplet motion, with a fast solution method for
the solution of partial differential equations in macro model, Shift-Matrix method, introduced to solve
the equations. Compared with other methods common used in Macro- and Mesoscopic to prove that
it’s fast enough and easy to implement. Afterwards, the effect of gravity is introduced so that the
migration and fusion of multiple droplets can be simulated, which is more generic in petroleum
industry. Compared with the Stokes formula common applied in the design of gravity separator in
current petroleum industry, it’s easy to see that this empirical formula is not enough to accurately
describe the droplet velocity. The effects of droplet initial position, droplet size, the density difference
between oil and water, and the force in horizontal directions in dropping process are also studied in
this paper, which make our algorithm more applicable in complicated cases in industrial practice.

2 Algorithm
To ensure our algorithm applicable to industry engineers, we try to find a method less profound to
general flow equations in order to make it easy to understand. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is
introduced to the common Stokes equations to describe phase distribution.

2.1 Phase Field Model
The general form of Cahn-Hilliard equation is as follows,

¶f

Here,

M is mobility and f represents order parameter, which can be calculated by,
r -r

r1 , r 2 represents

the local density of Fluid 1 and 2 individually and apparently,
interface, which is a common standard to check our algorithm.
The term f f in Equation (1) is free energy, calculated by

So the order parameter is finally transferred to

This analytical solution is applied in our simulation, to define the initial condition of order
parameter, which represents the phase distribution.
If the free energy is calculated by

are interface parameters. Finally, the chemical potential can be written as

µ = -kDf - rf + uf 3

(11)
Finally, combined with common Stokes equations, the coupled Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations
model we need to govern the algorithm is

where,

system.

2.2 Shift-Matrix
Shift-Matrix method is developed by Prof. Sun (Shuyu Sun, 2012), aiming at concise code and fast
computation, especially for coding in high level language, including Matlab and R. High level coding
language is widely applied in industry engineering, as it’s easy for learning and with rich function
library, it’s very convenient to coding and ensure the conciseness. Generally, for finite-difference
method in staggered grid, the discretization of Stokes Momentum Equation in x-direction is:

(13)

where the velocity term is defined as:

éu x ,1h u 1x ,h3 ! u 1x ,h 1 ù

(14)

As a result, the main focus of nowadays algorithm is to transfer the pressure located at the cell
center to the corresponding location of velocity. Similarly, for conservation equation,

ù

(15)

the location of velocity is not where we define it.
As what we did in previous work, three matrixes are introduced here and the whole algorithm
could be written as

where we need to add terms of f to the right-hand-side and then using the phase conservation
equation in (12) to update the order parameter f .

2.3 Implement and Coding
Due to the mathematical principle of Shift-Matrix Method is based on matrix transformation, it’s
very suitable to code in Matlab, which is highly efficient in matrix calculation. It’s easy to obtain the
auxiliary matrix we need as follows (Tao Zhang, 2015):
Dcx=(speye(m*n)-kron(speye(n),circshift(eye(m),[1,0])))/hx;

	

Tao Zhang et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1953–1962

1957

Dcy=(speye(m*n)-kron(circshift(eye(n),[1,0]),speye(m)))/hy;
Dsq=mu*(Dcx*Dcx'+Dcy*Dcy');
Compared to Tao’s previous work, what we need to add here is to solve the order parameter, f .
With the velocity we get by solving the momentum and mass conservation equation, we can update
the order parameter, using upwind scheme as:
phi=phi+deltaT*( ...
uxL.*(uxL>0).*circshift(phi,[1,0])-ux.*(ux>0).*phi + ...
uyL.*(uyL>0).*circshift(phi,[0,1])-uy.*(uy>0).*phi + ...
uxL.*(uxL<0).*phi-ux.*(ux<0).*circshift(phi,[-1,0]) + ...
uyL.*(uyL<0).*phi-uy.*(uy<0).*circshift(phi,[0,-1]) );
This scheme is proved to be energy stable in the work of Jisheng Kou (Jisheng Kou, 2016) (Jisheng
Kou, 2016). Using Shift-Matrix method here again, we can easily get the coefficient matrix as
B=I+deltaT*mobility*(infK*Dsq*Dsq-2*Dsq);
bL=I-deltaT*3*mobility*Dsq;
phi(:)=B\(bL*phi(:)+deltaT*mobility*Dsq*(phi(:).^3));
Afterwards, it’s easy to solve the phase conservation equation in (12),
phi(:)=B\(bL*phi(:)+deltaT*mobility*Dsq*(phi(:).^3));
A periodic boundary condition is again applied here, and the distribution of order parameter is
selected as the initial condition:

f ( x,0) = f0 ( x), x Î W

(17)

3 Numerical Experiments
3.1 Droplets Fusion Process
In a steady area filled by oil, two water droplets, center located at (49.5,55.5) and (49.5,31.5), are
tangent to a point (49.5,43.5), with same radius of 12. The distribution of oil and water phase is
separated by the order parameter, which is 1 for water and -1 for oil. The density ratio of oil and water
is 0.8. The initial condition can be shown as:

Fig. 1 Phase distribution at the beginning
Under zero gravity, the two droplets will be fused by surface tension. Several methods are applied
here as well to compare with our method, including Front Tracking and Level Set method in
macroscopic and LBM method using RK model in mesoscopic scale. We don’t try microscopic
methods, as they are currently not probable in industry. They perform a similar result process as:

t=400
t=1600
Fig. 2 Distribution of order parameter during fusion process
According to the paper of Reggio M, the final size of fused droplets should be the same as the

summation of the first two droplets. In our results, the final radius of big droplet is 2 times the
initial one, which meets the previous work.
However, the CPU time used in each method is quite different (perform on a same PC):

In another word, our method is more efficient among the popular Macroscopic and Mesoscopic
methods used in industry.
Of course, we can simulate the fusion of more droplets:

t=200
t=400
t=1600
Fig. 3 Distribution of order parameter during fusion process
The final diameter of fused droplet is close to
results and proves the robustness of our method.

3 ´ 24 = 41.57 ,

which meets the previous

3.2 Droplet Rising/ Dropping
The effect of gravity is non-neglectable in real world, so if we want to simulate closer to meet the
require of industry engineering, the gravity should be taken into concerns. Due to density difference,
oil (water) droplets will rise (drop) in water (oil) flow.
For a single water droplet, as shown in figure 4, and the density ratio is 0.8:

	

Tao Zhang et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1953–1962

Fig. 4 Single droplet

1959

Fig. 6 Velocity of water droplet

The dropping process is as follows:

t=200
t=400
t=600
Fig. 5 Distribution of order parameter during dropping process
The dropping velocity is essential to know in the design of water separator in petroleum industry.
At present, the most popular to calculate the velocity is the Stokes Settlement Equation, which is an
empirical formula:

u=
where,

d l2 ´ (r w - r o )
18 µ

(18)

d l is the diameter of droplet， r w and ro are the density of water and oil separately and

µ is the viscosity. By this, the dropping velocity is concerned as constant:
u = 0.18 ´ 0.18 ´ 0.2 ÷ 18 = 3.6 ´10 -4

(19)
However, in our simulation, this velocity is shown as Fig. 6. Obviously, the velocity is not
constant, but it includes the value estimated by Stokes Equation. The reasons for this can be concluded
that there is droplet deformation in the dropping process, which causes the changing of force driven on
it, so that the force balance premise is no longer established.
In addition, we can simulate different conditions of droplet rising(dropping). For example, if we
change the initial droplet location to the upper area, there will be a different process and more shapes
can be observed during the process:

t=0

t=400

t=1000

1960	

Fig. 7 Dropping process of different initial location
If we change the size of initial droplet, the process is different as well:

t=0

t=400
Fig. 8 Dropping process of different initial size
We can change the density ration to 0.6 and the result varies obviously:

t=1000

t=0

t=400
t=1000
Fig. 9 Dropping process of different density ration
Of course, we can simulate the rising process of oil droplet in water flow:

t=0

t=400
t=1000
Fig. 10 Rising process
In engineering practice, there will always be a force in the cross directio (SUN Dongliang, 2012)n
of gravity, such as electrostatic force in the water separation process. This could also be simulated:

t=0

t=400
t=1000
Fig. 11 Dropping process under forces in cross direction

3.3 Droplets Rising Combined with Fusion
Real multiphase flow cannot just be a simple droplet. However, the simulation of one droplet
rising process and the fusion process of two droplets is the foundation to simulate the dropping
process combined with fusion process of multiple droplets.
For a simplest process of two droplets, the result is as follows:

t=0

t=400
t=1000
Fig. 12 Rising process combined with fusion
Previously, the droplets are located vertically, but the distribution of droplets in real industry is
always random. We want to show that our algorithm can simulate this condition as well:

t=0

t=400

t=800
t=3000
Fig. 13 Rising process combined with fusion
Finally, we can simulate multiple droplet motion, under gravity and horizontal forces, located
randomly at the beginning, and with different density ratio and initial size. The result is as follows:

t=0

t=400

t=1000

4 Conclusions
To study better the oil-water two phase flow common seen in petroleum industry, we develop a
fast algorithm to simulate droplet motions, using phase field model to describe the phase distribution
in the flow process.
An efficient partial difference equation solver—Shift-Matrix method is applied here, and we
explain clearly the method of introducing order parameter into the efficient partial differential solver.
It makes our algorithm faster in calculation, especially using high level coding language, as Matlab
and R, which is more understandable and easy to learn and code, resulting more acceptable in industry
engineering. The upwind scheme is used to update the order parameter, which is proved to be energy
decay and means that the process is stable and meets the second law of thermodynamics. The whole
algorithm is compared with other methods in different scales, including Front Tracking and Level Set
method in macroscopic and LBM method using RK model in mesoscopic scale. The results prove that
our algorithm is much faster, especially for strict convergence criterions and the result of fusion
process is verified through phase conservation.
In addition, we take the effect of gravity into account and compare the result of droplet velocity
during dropping using our algorithm with the empirical formula, Stokes Equation, which is common
used in industry. As the dropping process is much complicated than the hypothetical ideal force
balance, the dropping velocity, which is important to design the water separation, is much reliable
using our simulation method.
Afterwards, we combine the fusion and dropping process, and simulate the process under gravity
and horizontal force. Finally, we can simulate multiple droplet motion, under gravity and horizontal
forces, located randomly at the beginning, and with different density ratio and initial size, which is
more close to the real multiphase flow and more applicable and acceptable in industry engineering.
