The motivation to portray a city as a complex network comes from the desire to explain
how it’s mobility works and how it influences the city’s livability. In this regard, several works
have focused on such problem [2], but until now, there has been a lack of a clear, transparent
and precise methodology for employing complex networks in a complete process of analyzing
the city, i.e. from data preparation to an in-depth analysis from a geometrical perspective.
Furthermore, the former works lack techniques to assist in the planning and design process, by
not being able to identify low-access regions that are critical to the displacement in a city.
In this sense, we propose a methodology that uses topological and geometrical measures
in the task of analyzing the location and access to different types of facilities in a city. The
hypothesis of this work is that geometric and geographic measurements allied to street networks
can aid in the identification of urban inconsistencies that occur due to ill-conceived urban
decisions. Our assumption is that the mobility is derived from the access indices of a city,
which can be identified by measuring the distances among the locations of the city facilities.
Based on those assumptions, our work introduces the following contributions:
(1) Scalability: we contribute to the extraction, preparation, preprocessing, and processing
of street networks, in ways beyond those of former works;
(2) Methodology: we introduce methods, based on the network topology and geometry, which
recognize low-access regions that are critical to the city planning and design process; and,
(3) Real-world application: we quantitatively characterize inconsistencies of the Brazilian
city of Sao Carlos, discussing their meanings and implications.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 presents related works that are
relevant to our proposal. In Sect. 3, we introduce our methods, demonstrating how to evaluate
the access by identifying the inconsistencies of a city. The results are presented in Sect. 4, where
we show how to account critical regions, discussing how to improve access to the majority of
the nodes in a real-world city. Finally, the conclusion and final remarks come in Sect. 5.

Related Work

Preceding our contributions, in this section, we discuss related work comparatively relevant to
our proposal. In Subs. 2.1, we present works that focus on the network’s properties to identify
cities’ characteristics, whereas Subs. 2.2 introduces the ones that concentrate on the cities’
patterns to enhance their mobility. Finally, other relevant related work came in Subs. 2.3.

2.1

Urban Space Characterization

The motivation for our methodology is the desire to identify low-access regions through complex
networks. Such regions, if taken into account in the planning and design process, can enhance
decision-making activities and, consequently, improve the mobility of a city as a whole.
In this sense, Porta, Crucitti, and Latora [6] performed an in-depth investigation of centrality
measures in cities. They introduced a methodology aiming to identify urban structures that
impact upon spatial cognition and collective behaviors. In a different perspective, our scope
covers topological and geometrical analyses to characterize urban spaces by considering a set
of referential nodes, i.e. facilities, of a city.
Strano et al. [9] investigated the network’s geometrical attributes, highlighting the fact that
cities share structural similarities due to their quasi-planarity. Whereas, Scellato et al. [8]
explained how it is possible to identify routes that affect retails, land-use separation, and

collective behaviors. However, none of them was proficient in identifying regions that lack
access when compared to others, the desired result to support the planning and the design.

2.2

Traffic Planning and Mobility Enhancement

The desire to characterize the urban scenario comes from daily issues such as slowness, traffic
jams, and lack of access. Such issues impact on the citizens’ lives by negatively affecting their
mobility. Despite the notable studies on the topic, little has been done to enhance low-access
regions. They focused on the flow of the streets, while the access criterion was put aside.
This is the case of Costa et al. [3] that evaluated the effectiveness of the underground
systems in connecting scattered places. They considered that citizens use different kinds of
transportation to move along a city; in contrast, our work is based on a sole transportation
mean. This is because we consider transportation as part of a service, which is allocated in a
facility and demands displacement between a pair of vertices by the streets of a city.
Viana and Costa [11] examined the importance of fast long-range connections between two
remote locations, aiming to improve the time displacement in a city. These connections are far
larger than what is reasonable in the urban space because long-range streets are attached to
geographical and financial constraints, which would require different research approaches.

2.3

Other Related Work

The analysis of ill-designed urban structures and its related problems is not limited to the
previous works. For instance, Crucitti, Latora, and Porta [4] identified common characteristics
between self-organized and planned cities. Zhang, Zeng, Jia and Li [12] focused on the optimal
placement of a set of facilities to provide the lowest travel time to all network nodes, while
Zhang, Cao, Liu and Huang [13] worked in the development of an optimal facility location
plan, and also, there is the work of Travençolo and Costa [10] that describes the accessibility in
the context of complex networks. In this regard, our proposal consists in using topo-geometrical
measures to characterize low-access regions, contributing to state-of-the-art on street analysis.

Proposed Methodology

Our methodology starts with formal notations, which are required for the understanding of
our proposal, followed by the description of our data. Next, in Subs. 3.1 we introduce a novel
pre-processing technique. In Subs. 3.2 we characterize the concept of urban inconsistency and,
subsequently, in Subs. 3.3, we describe its categories. Finally, in Subs. 3.4 we describe our
algorithm to evaluate such inconsistencies considering a city in the form of a street network.
Required concepts. Along the text, we refer to a distance-weighted directed graph
G = {V, E} as a complex network 1 , which is composed of a set V of |V | nodes, and another
set E of |E| edges. An edge e ∈ E is an ordered pair < u, v >, in which u ∈ V is titled
origin and v ∈ V is titled destination, u = v. By being a street network, its elements are
georeferenced, and, therefore, each node v ∈ V has two coordinates {Lvat , Lvon }, the latitude
and longitude, respectively. Also, we use the term primary to refer to a network derived from
a map, and auxiliary to define a post-processed network. Furthermore, mobility and access
are terms used to denote the displacement capability in a city. The term path refers to an
ordered set of distance-weighted directed edges that connects two nodes, such path has the
length corresponding to the weighted sum of its edges. Still, the path of minimum length, also
between two nodes, which is called as shortest path, is referred here as network distance.

Despite different, in this paper, the terms graph, complex network and street network, are equivalent.

Data source. Our work benefits from electronic cartographic maps that are extracted from
the OpenStreetMap 2 (OSM) platform. OSM provides files that represent the spatial elements
of a city as points, lines, and polygons. Such elements are abstractions of the real-world and
are composed of an identification number and georeferenced coordinates.

3.1

Preprocessing Technic

Given a map provided by OSM, the first step is to derive a street network from it. To do so,
we considered streets as edges and street intersections as nodes. In addition, we pondered the
edges’ weight with their real-world distance in meters. Later, we noticed that the resulting
network was filled with redundant elements due to the geometrical characteristics of the city.
This is the case, for example, of roundabouts, which are translated into polygons with a high
number of nodes and edges. The redundant data usually raise the required resources to process
these networks, especially the ones that represent capital cities. Besides, street segments that
are not relevant negatively influence algorithms that depend on the topology of the network.
Therefore, to scale down the network, we designed an algorithm that removes redundancies at
the same time that it maintains the network’s characteristics.
Our algorithm merges nodes that do not deprive the network of its primary feature, i.e.
the distances of its paths. The algorithm starts by identifying nodes with total degree two
and others with total degree four — in a street network, the degree of a node measures the
number of incoming and outcoming streets. Such nodes correspond to the ones in the middle of
a directed path. We consider the selected nodes as redundant if they are transitional, that is,
if they simply break a street into segments without defining a street intersection; and, if there
is not an edge that connects the nodes that communicate with the transitional one. Hence,
when the transitional node is removed, a new edge is created to communicate the nodes that
the transitional one was connected with. These steps are algorithmically described by Alg. 1.

The algorithm is linear in the number of nodes O(|V |). Considering that nodes and edges
are removed within the iterations of the algorithm, it cannot be parallelized. However, it runs
in less than a second over a network of a 200,000-inhabitant’s city.

3.2

Identification of Urban Inconsistencies

The aim of our methodology is to characterize urban spaces of a city from the point of view
of the location of its facilities. To this end, we start by tracking a set F of facilities, and,
subsequently, identifying two sets of nodes in the surroundings of each facility f ∈ F.
Perimeter set. The first set corresponds to the closest nodes to a facility f according to the
geodesic (Euclidean) distance, as defined by Eq. 1. Such distance dE
ij is measured between nodes
i and j over the Earth’s surface, which is derived from the Spherical Law of Cosines.

(2)

Notice that, given the set of network nodes V and a set of facilities F, every node v ∈ V
pertains to the perimeter set of a single facility f ∈ F. That is, according to Eq. 1, the sets VEf
and VEf  , ∀ (f, f  ) ∈ F, f = f  , are mutually disjoint.

Network-distance set. The second set corresponds to the nodes closest to a given facility f
via network-distance from any node v to f , and it is defined by Eq. 3, where dN
ij is the network
distance from node i to node j. Notice that, the sets VNf and VNf  , ∀ (f, f  ) ∈ F, f = f  are
mutually disjoint; that is, a node v ∈ V can be network-closest to one facility f ∈ F at a time.
N


VNf = {v ∈ V | dN
vf < dvf  ∀ f ∈ F, f ∈ F, f = f }

(3)

In view of the fact that the network-distance set is directed, the network-distance set TO
a given facility f might not be the same as the network distance set FROM a given facility f .
Hence, we define the network-distance set from a facility f ∈ F to the nodes in V as:
N


V̄Nf = {v ∈ V | dN
f v < df v  ∀ f ∈ F, f ∈ F, f = f }

(4)

The essence of our work is that the nodes that are closest to a facility according to the
network distance, and at the same time, are not closest to this same facility according to the
geodesic distance are evidence of network inconsistencies. These are considered inconsistencies
because the network is supposed to render streets that provide access through shortest distances,
which becomes a false premise due to ill-conceived urban decisions. In the following, such
inconsistencies are defined by set operations, which characterizes categories of inconsistencies.

3.3

Categorizing Urban Inconsistencies

In the whole urban scenario, there are three displacement cases used to categorize groups of
inconsistencies, which are all based on the flow direction. In the first one, the flow is from the
node v to the facility f ; in the second, the flow is from the facility f to the node v; and, in
the third case, the flow is mutual between v and f . These three situations lead to the following
inconsistencies definitions that are based on the directed characteristic of the street network:
(1) Inward Inconsistency: nodes that are geodesic-closest to a facility, but network-closest
(from v to f , as given by Eq. 3) to another; this case corresponds to the set given by:
ΦIf = VEf − VNf

(2) Outward Inconsistency: the same as an inward inconsistency, but considering the
opposite direction (from f to v, as given by Eq. 4):
ΦOf = VEf − V̄Nf

(6)

(3) Absolute Inconsistency: nodes that are, simultaneously, inward and outward
inconsistencies, which corresponds to the following intersection:
ΦAf = ΦIf ∩ ΦOf

(7)

Notice that, inconsistencies are nodes apart from the normality of the network mobility, as
so, these nodes represent anomalies derived from the mobility scenario of a given city. Through
the concept of urban inconsistencies and the definitions of its categories, it is feasible to devise
an algorithm capable of recognizing such inconsistencies, as accomplished with Alg. 2.

3.4

Inconsistencies Identification Algorithm

The idea of the algorithm is to locate low-access regions by considering the nodes geodesic and
network distances, to a set of facilities F that are within the city. It is noteworthy that our
algorithm evaluates an inconsistency category at a time, and, therefore, we used c ∈ {I, O, A} to
denote an arbitrary category that is being analyzed. We use the variables fn and fe to denote
the closest facility to a given node v considering the network and geodesic distances.
The functions NetworkDistance and GeodesicDistance are used to identify the closest facility
between fn /fe and f , which are compared in lines 6 and 8. We confirm if a node is an
inconsistency in line 10, where we check if the f -minimum by network distance (fn ) and the
f -minimum by geodesic distance (fe ) are equal or not. If the node v is inconsistent, by being
wrongly closer to fn when it should be closer to fe , v is an inconsistency of fe — see line 11.
In line 12, the algorithm returns as output a set of inconsistencies, which are are grouped by
facility Vcf ⊆ Vc , ∀ f ∈ F. Furthermore, the sets Vcf and Vcf  , ∀ (f, f  ) ∈ F, f = f  , are mutually
disjoint; the meaning of that is, a node is an inconsistency to one, and only one, facility.

Alg. 2 runs in O(|V ||F|3 ) in the average case, where |F| is the number of public services and
|V | is the number of nodes, |F|  |V |. In the worst case, where |F| = |V |, the complexity would
be O(|V |4 ). It is straightly parallelized, running in a minute over a 200,000-inhabitant’s city.

Experiments and Discussions

Our experiments start by validating the Redundancy Removal (RR) algorithm (see Subs. 3.1).
This process precedes the identification of urban inconsistencies (see Subs. 3.2) because all the
subsequent experiments are carried out by the post-processed, i.e. auxiliary, network.
Assessment of Redundancy Removal Algorithm. The algorithm comes to be useful if it
does not deprive the network mobility. Such mobility is measured by the edge distance that
connects all nodes of the network. In this sense, it is enough if we evaluate the total edge length
of a city (W), which is given by the summation of the lengths of all their edges. The summation
must be the same in both primary and auxiliary networks to certify that the paths between the
nodes do not change due to the removal of redundancies. It is clear that the network will have
fewer elements, but the nodes that prevail will be connected to longer edges.
As explained before, networks with redundant elements require more resources to be
processed, especially networks derived from capital cities. In this sense, in the first experiment,
we preprocessed five cities to assess whether the lengths were conserved. The results are
presented in Tbl. 1, where W denotes the total edge length, in addition to the percentage
(%) of redundancies removed, both in terms of the primary and auxiliary network.

Table 1: Redundancy Removal in five cities, indicating that the length of the edges is the
same in every case and exhibiting the percentage of elements removed during the process.
When analyzing the data in the table, it is possible to see that the length is the same in
every case; that is, no relevant information was lost, so the networks preserved their mobility
properties by keeping the distance between their nodes. Also, it is possible to see that the
majority of the nodes (> 60%) of all the cities comes to be redundancies, which means that
results acquired from primary networks are dubious. This is because many measurements rely
on how the city is connected and in the distance of the streets that communicate their nodes,
which cannot be correctly accounted via primary networks.
Considering now that the RR algorithm assures the mobility aspects of the network, we
applied it to the city of Sao Carlos, a 200,000-inhabitant’s city, which corresponds to our
real-world case study. The primary network contained 12,464 nodes and 26,378 edges; after
processing, we got an auxiliary network with 5,984 nodes and 16,338 edges. The reduction was
of 51.98% in the number of nodes, and of 38.06% in the number of edges, which means 57.46%
of all elements. These processes are depicted regarding a city sub-region in Fig. 1a and 1b.
Assessment of the Auxiliary Network. Afterward, to understand the impact of the
algorithm to the properties of the graph we evaluated the characteristics of the auxiliary
network. First, the results from degree distribution, depicted in Fig. 2a and 2d, show that
the number of nodes with degree 2 and 4, which refers to paths, were reduced, and the portion
of nodes with degree 6 and 8 that form city blocks — regions that are surrounded by streets —
were increased significantly. This is evidence of that the primary network is more propitious to
an inaccurate degree characterization by the high number of redundancies.

edges with a given in-degree in the x-axis, and out-degree in the y-axis. It is possible to see that
the mobility was enhanced because the main diagonal became darker after the preprocessing.
The reason is that the auxiliary graph has fewer low-degree nodes, characterizing a higher
probability of movement in fewer steps with the same weight.
Finally, Fig. 2c and 2f shows the degree correlation of the networks, where is possible to
notice that the degree of the nodes connected to others with degree 1 changed significantly in
the auxiliary network. This is due to the removal of redundancies, which causes the nodes that
communicate with the redundant one to connect straightly to nodes with higher degrees.
All the analysis seen from above, are results that state that the RR algorithm reduces the
number of redundant nodes at the same time that it reveals the real topology of the network.
As a consequence, we discuss results from urban inconsistency just in the auxiliary network.
Identification of Urban Inconsistencies. At the last step, we tested the Inconsistency
Identification Alg. 2, over the auxiliary network derived from the city of Sao Carlos. To this
end, we selected three kinds of facilities in the city. We chose facilities that have implications
for public security, health and education, being respectively represented by police stations,
hospitals, and schools. In addition, each one has a different type of assistance to citizens,
so they represent different categories of inconsistencies. That being said, consider that for
police stations, hospitals, and schools, we have inward, outward, and absolute inconsistency,
respectively. These results are presented in Tbl. 2, where each category of inconsistency was
evaluated independently, so there is no influence between different kinds of facilities.
By analyzing the data, it is possible to conceive that the number of inconsistencies is directly
related to the number of facilities. The reason is that inconsistencies are more probable to be
allocated at the intersection of the perimeter boundaries. As a consequence, by having more

facilities, there will be more intersections with the boundaries of the others, which will lead
to an increased number of inconsistencies. A general case is illustrated in Fig. 3a, where the
inconsistencies are found where the perimeters intersect, while Fig. 3b depicts a real case of
inconsistency found in the city of Sao Carlos, which is related to a Hospital position.
Considering that inconsistency emerges within the intersection of different perimeters,
we notice as well that they cannot be eradicated without altering the network topology.
Nonetheless, the notion of urban inconsistency describes the lack of access in a city. Such
inconsistencies can serve as guidance to enhance a city by improving its design. Hence,
this scenario opens a challenge to find feasible locations to facilities that reduce, rather than

Conclusions

In this paper, we focus on identifying low-access regions through a methodology able to analyze
urban structures considering a set of facilities. Our methodology is based on the hypothesis that
geometric and geographic measurements allied to street networks can aid in the identification
of urban inconsistencies that occur due to ill-conceived urban decisions. To demonstrate our
methodology we proposed a set of formalisms, and two algorithms named Redundancy Removal
and Inconsistency Identification. Our achievements confirm the hypothesis of our work, allowing
us to state that the city of Sao Carlos lacks well-positioned facilities and that low-access
regions hamper the mobility from or to facilities that provide public assistance. The highlighted
contributions are: (i) a novel concept based on critical problems in the urban design, which
are caused by mispositioning facilities in a city; (ii) new approaches to preprocess and prepare
maps in the form of street networks, as well as a method to analyze urban inconsistencies; also,
(iii) the analyses of the discussed methods by evaluating the Brazilian city of Sao Carlos.
