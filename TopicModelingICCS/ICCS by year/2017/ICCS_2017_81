two major challenges appear when simulating forest fire spread: the process of facing up a
multi-physical problem (combustion and atmosphere) and the difficulty on either obtaining
or estimating the initial environmental conditions where the fire is taking place (vegetation,
moisture contents, local meteorological conditions, etc.).
In order to deal with the multi-physics challenge there exist different approaches: the unidirectional, the bidirectional and the integration strategy. The unidirectional approach uses
static meteorological information, such as wind speed and direction, to drive the fire propagation, but does not consider the effect of the fire on the atmosphere. Many simulators use this
strategy due to its simplicity and speed (Behave-Plus [4] and FARSITE [7] are two examples).
The second approach, the bidirectional scheme, is a coupled system where the fire propagation
considers meteorological information and also on the other way round, so that the effect of
heat fluxes from the fire on the atmosphere evolution is also captured. WRF-SFIRE [11] and
MesoNH-ForeFire [6] use this bidirectional strategy. Finally, the third approach, the integration
scheme, tries to integrate all the processes using only one simulator which combines everything.
Nowadays, it does not allow to reproduce the fire behavior on a practical time duration, so it
is just used in an academical way. Some examples could be FIRETEC [10] and WFDS [12].
Regarding the uncertainty in the initial environmental conditions, there exists several works
that focus on providing solutions such as estimate those unknown values based on calibrating
strategies which considers the recent behavior of the fire [1][5][15].
This work is focused on the bidirectional simulation strategy using WRF-SFIRE as study
case simulator. As it has been previously mentioned, this strategy couples two models that have
a continuously interaction through time. In this context, the spatial and time resolution are
critical to reach the appropriate accuracy in the propagation prediction but, on the other hand,
the execution time is also critical to provide useful predictions from the operational point of
view. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an analysis of the WRF-SFIRE simulator to provide
a methodology to determine a trade off between time an accuracy keeping the multi-physics
system stable.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the studied simulator WRFSFIRE. Then, in Section 3, the experiment scenario used in the experiments is introduced and
described. After that, the obtained results are shown in Section 4. Finally, a summary of all
the conclusions extracted from the experimental results is presented in Section 5.

WRF-SFIRE

WRF-SFIRE is a forest fire simulator which couples the meteorological model WRF-ARW [13]
and the fire spread model resolving Rothermel’s equation through the level set method called
SFIRE. The Rothermel’s model is formulated as:
w + φ
s)
R = R0 (n + φ

where R0 is the rate of fire spread in a particular point dismissing the effects of wind and
 w is the wind
slope, n is the normal direction to the fire perimeter on that particular point, φ

factor and φs is the slope factor. Therefore, Rothermel’s model requires information about the
combustion properties of the vegetation over the simulated domain (R0 ), the local meteorology
 w ) and the slope of the terrain (φ
 s ). This point-to-point semiwhere the fire is occurring (φ
empirical equation is the basis to expand the perimeter using the level set method. In this
method, the burned region is defined as a level set function ψ = ψ(x, t) whose values are listed
in equation 2 and it evolves through the partial differential equation 3 where R is the previous
rate of spread solved in equation 1.

WRF-SFIRE solves the multi-physical problem related to forest fire propagation in a cyclic
fashion. That is, meteorological data is obtained by running WRF for a certain period of
time and, the obtained WRF data is used to expand the fire front numerically. At that point,
the heat fluxes that fire throws to the atmosphere are captured by the system and used to
compute WRF for the next time step. This constant feedback between the two models allows
to describe in a more realistic way all the process. In order to solve these two models properly,
it is necessary to do a discretization of the domain where the hazard is taking place. This
domain discretization is done in two different meshes in order to distinguish atmospheric and
fire processes. The recommended ratio between the number of atmospheric and fire mesh points
is 10 [11]. This refinement ratio allows to capture the combustion process that take place due
to the fire. It is also important to observe that the atmosphere is represented by a 3D grid in
order to capture the atmospheric vertical effects of the fire. However, the dimensions of the fire
propagation model used in WRF-SFIRE are only two. Therefore, fire variables are represented
in a 2D numerical grid. Figure 1 shows this mesh interrelation using, as example, a resolution
refinement ratio of 4. These atmospheric and fire meshes should be initialized with certain
starting data and boundary conditions. Subsequently, it is described these required data for
each mesh.

2.1

Atmospheric mesh

The atmospheric mesh needs static and dynamic data. The static data keeps constant at each
simulation step and it is conformed by geographical variables like orography, land use, soil type,
etc. On the other hand, boundary conditions are obtained from dynamic atmospheric data. This
atmospheric data are usually collected from a meteorologic forecast using either the outputs of
a coarse grain grid or the values of finer grid obtained after a nesting process. The dynamic
atmospheric variables required are wind speed and wind direction, pressure, temperature, etc.
These starting conditions are used to solve the atmosphere module WRF-ARW in order to
properly obtain the wind factor φw required in equation 1.

2.2

Fire mesh

The fire mesh uses a high resolution static data over the studied domain in order to fit accurately the information into the fire module. In particular, the data required by the fire module
is the vegetation (also called fuel) and the elevation maps. The vegetation type on a location
allows to predict the burning characteristics over that specific area and it is required to evaluate
the factor R0 in equation 1. On the other hand, a high resolution data of the elevation over the
terrain is important to solve the slope factor φs in equation 1.
Once all this initial data has been properly gathered, formatted and introduced to the
system using the preprocessing stage, the data-driven forest fire evolution is started. In the
next subsection, it is briefly described which are the resolution requirements in order to obtain
converged results.

Figure 1: WRF-SFIRE numerical grids with a refinement ratio equal to 4.

2.3

Resolution requirements

In WRF-SFIRE, the partial differential equation 3 is solved in all the domain points using different numerical methods of integration in time and space [11]. This fact causes computational
problems when high resolution grids are used. Therefore, depending on the ration between
the time step and resolution of the grid, some instability could appear loosing the convergence
of the solution. The recommended time step from general meteorological cases without fire
module is:
dt < 6 · dx
(4)
where dt is the time step in seconds and dx is the maximum spatial meteorological grid resolution
in kilometers. So, for instance, if the spatial resolution of the atmospheric mesh is 0.5 Km, the
maximum time step should be 3 seconds. It means that the atmosphere state is solved to obtain
the values of the atmospheric variables that will be used for the next 3 seconds. These values
are used to calculate the fire evolution during these 3 seconds considering a fire mesh of 0.05 Km
(using a refinement ratio of 10), and the heat fluxes calculated by the fire module are injected
back into the atmospheric model and so on.
In this scheme, where the atmosphere model affects the evolution of the fire and the evolution
of the fire affects the atmospheric state, it is necessary to use the adequate spatial and time
resolution to reach an accurate and stable solution in the shortest possible time. So, the main
goal of this paper is to study the effect of spatial and time resolution on the quality of the
prediction to determine the best configuration to make the system operational in real cases.
The time spent in doing the prediction is not the main focus of this work, however, some
information about the time incurred in carrying out the different experiments will be introduce
to exemplify the operational constraints in certain cases. This study has been done using a real
fire that took place in 2005 in Catalonia (North-East of Spain).

3

Experimental Scenario

The real case analyzed is a forest fire occurred in Catalonia (North-East of Spain, lat. 4154 N
and long. 1 40 E) on 8th July 2005. The 2005 Cardona fire burned a total surface of 1439 ha.
and it lasted 6 hours. The fire started at 14:30 and it keeps until 20:30 approximately. As it
has been described in the previous section, WRF-SFIRE requires the initial conditions of the
environment where the event is taking place to start the simulation of the forest fire propagation
and this data depends on the geographical domain involved in the simulation. Therefore, how
this data is obtained for the study case is subsequently described.

3.1

Domain

The studied domain is a 49 Km2 (7 Km × 7 Km) forest area that surrounds the real fire
perimeters and allows to properly simulate the propagation of the fire. The election of the
domain’s size is an important factor because all the numerical equations are solved in each point
of the domain. Therefore, a smart cutting of the domain would eventually save unnecessary
execution time and, as it will be later explained, it allows to use higher resolution.

3.2

Initial Conditions

Regarding the atmospheric mesh initialization, the initial static weather data used in this
scenario is the Complete Dataset, which has been obtained from the WRF Source Codes and
Graphics Software Download Page [20]. The dynamic weather initial data is obtained from two
different sources, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and
the local meteorological service Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya (SMC). In the first case, the
data is provided with a 55 Km horizontal resolution and 29 vertical levels, whereas in the second
case the data comes out from two nesting procedures of WRF using as initial conditions the
ones provided by ECMWF. Consequently, the obtained initial conditions are at 3 Km horizontal
resolution and interpolated at 19 vertical levels.
In the case of the fire mesh, the required initialization data is the elevation and the vegetation
maps. The elevation map has been obtained from the Spanish National Geographic Institute
at a resolution of 25 meters (represented in a gray scale on all the pictures in section 4). In
particular, this resolution is the finest resolution in all the system, therefore, in order to exploit
to the maximum this finest resolution map, the rest of maps and grids resolutions will be defined
as a ration of the elevation map resolution. The vegetation map used has a resolution of 50
meters and it has been obtained from a transformation of the CORINE land cover project
data into the original 13 fuel models from Anderson [3] used in WRF-SFIRE. In order to use
vegetation and elevation data properly, a nearest-neighbor interpolation of the vegetation data
over the domain has been done, that way, the final fuel map has the same resolution as the
elevation data (25 meters resolution).

3.3

Atmospheric and fire meshes discretization

Once the resolution of the initial conditions has been set up, one should decide the domain
discretization refinement for both the atmospheric and fire grids. The main constraint for this
election is the recommended mesh ratio into the atmospheric and the fire meshes, which is
defined as 10, and the condition 4 for the time step in order to assure the convergence of the
system. So, any mesh discretization that accomplish this conditions could be appropriate. In
order to understand how the different discretization meshes have been set up in the experimental
study, in this section, it is described how the different values have been chosen for a basic case.
As it has been mentioned above, the minimum resolution map in the whole system is the
elevation map resolution with a value of 25 meters. In order to exploit to the maximum the
elevation map resolution, the fire mesh resolution has been set up to approximately the same
value as the elevation map, in particular to 24 meters. Then, taking into account that the
recommended mesh ratio into the atmospheric and the fire meshes is 10 and trying to fit the
atmospheric mesh into the domain size, the resolution of the atmospheric mesh has been defined
to 236 meters. Consequently, the atmospheric mesh has a dimension of 29x29 points, meanwhile
the fire mesh is composed by a mesh of 290x290 points. Once the meshes resolutions have been
set up, one can determine the time step. As it was previously stated, in order to assure that

the system converges to a numerical solution, condition 4 must be accomplished and, with this
particular settings, the required dt should be 1.5 seconds.

Experimental Results

The main objective of this work, consists in analyzing the influence of the data resolution when
driving a forest fire simulation using WRF-SFIRE. As mentioned before, in order to evaluate
the accuracy of the prediction results the so-called Cardona fire has been used. Different
experiments have been carried out to determine the influence of the data resolution in the
propagation results. The definition of the experiments and the discussion on their results are
described in the following sections.

4.1

Changing initial condition data resolution

As it was previously introduced, the initial conditions have been obtained from two different
sources: ECMWF at 55 Km resolution and SMC at 3 Km resolution. Using the data directly
from ECMWF is faster because it spends less time on the preprocessing stage, but it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the results. Therefore, an initial experiment has been carried
out, using these two different dynamic atmospheric data inputs. Furthermore, this atmospheric
data provided by meteorological centers could be just used to initialize the boundary conditions (usually nested data from ECMWF computed each specific time step) or they could be
injected in the simulation process every hour using the values provided by the meteorological
forecast. So, these two possibilities have also been compared. Figure 2a shows the obtained
final predicted fire propagation when running WRF-SFIRE with the basic atmospheric and fire
grid resolutions previously described and the following four configurations are executed: 55 Km
data from ECMWF and 3 Km data from SMC used both either as initial conditions or injecting
the forecast data each hour into the system. As it can be observed, the injection of meteorological predictions every hour does not introduce any improvement in the forest fire propagation
prediction. Actually, the fire propagation clearly differs from the real fire propagation whatever
the atmospheric initial data resolution is used, being underestimated in the case of 55 Km
resolution and propagating to the opposite side in the case of 3 Km resolution. This is due to
the fact that the atmosphere is forced to values that have been forecast without considering the
presence of a forest fire, that is, the feedback process introduced by WRF-SFIRE is disturbed.
Then, if it is analyzed the results obtained when using only the meteorological input data at
the very beginning of the process and let then WRF-SFIRE freely run, the 3 Km resolution
provides much better results (green dotted line) than the 55 Km resolution data, which keeps
under estimating the real fire propagation. Clearly, the nesting process introduced by the local
meteorological service (SMC) to increase the resolution of the atmospheric data to 3 Km allows
to catch the atmosphere behavior more accurately. So, in this comparison, the best results are
obtained when 3 Km resolution initial data are used and no meteorological prediction forecast
is introduced during the simulation process. In any case, there is a certain underestimation of
the fire propagation, but the main orientation of the fire propagation is captured.

Changing fire mesh resolution and time step

From the previous experiment, one comes out with the best configuration in terms of the initial
data resolution, this setting is called the standard configuration (3km initial atmospheric data
resolution used only at the beginning of the process). However, in order to be sure that this

standard configuration is not affected by other factors, it is analyzed the influence of the number
of fire points and the time step into the accuracy of the result. For that purpose, two variants
of the standard experiment have been carried out. On the one hand, the number of fire points
within the meteorological mesh has been doubled, that is, instead of 10 fire points for each
meteorological point, it has been used 20 points. On the other hand, the time step has been
set up to 0.5 seconds. The objective of this two experiments is, first, to analyze the influence of
the fire mesh resolution keeping the atmospheric one fix and, secondly, to discard the influence
of the time precision in the results. The results are shown in Figure 2b. As it can be observed,
decreasing the time step to 0.5 second does not have a significant effect on the fire propagation
(olive green dotted shape), and doubling the fire points (dark green dotted shape) introduces an
improvement in the fire propagation, but the obtained fire spread is still far away from the real
propagation. These results show that it is necessary to modify the atmosphere mesh resolution
in order to properly catch the interaction effects between the fire and the atmosphere.

4.3

Changing atmospheric mesh resolution

As it has been previously stated, it is necessary to check the influence of the atmosphere grid
resolution. Therefore, different mesh configurations have been set up to analyze this effect. It
should be bearing in mind that the fire grid resolution will be also affected due to the refinement ratio of 10 and the time step will be set according to the 4 condition. Table 1 listed the
different configurations tested in this experiment. The results are shown in figure 3 where it
could be observed the improvement in terms of prediction accuracy generated for the different
atmosphere grid refinements tested. In this image, the only difference among all the simulated
fire propagations is the meteorological mesh resolution. To ensure that the improvement is
due to a better numerical characterization of the atmosphere, figure 4 represents graphically
the wind speed and direction at two different time steps (1 am and 6 pm). In the four left
figures (initial atmosphere data), there is the same module and direction in all the cases but
represented at different resolutions. However, the evolution changes a lot among the four different cases (four right figures). Finally, Figure 5 shows the difference between the fire front
simulation results using WRF-SFIRE at 100 meters resolution (dotted shapes) and the real fire
front (full non-dotted shape) at different time instants. In general terms, the predictions are
quite successful and the fire propagation tendency is properly predicted.

At that point, it is necessary to introduce a short discussion about the execution time required to perform the above described experiments. As it has previously mentioned, to perform
a deep study on the relation between time an data resolution is out of the scope of this work.
However, it is interesting to highlight certain aspects related to the time incurred in running
WRF-SFIRE. The WRF-SFIRE code is parallelized using MPI and OpenMP programming
paradigms. All the experiments reported in this work have been executed using a simple parallel version using 8 OpenMP threads in a multi-threading Intel Xeon machine of 8 cores. This
configuration is a first test to determine the time constraints that implies to use high atmospheric mesh resolutions. As a matter of example, the standard configuration (atmospheric
mesh of 29x29 points) lasts 1 hour 51 minutes to deliver the prediction result. This time could
be considered a good elapsed time for operational purposes but, as we have shown, in terms of

accuracy of the results this configuration is not good. On the other hand, using an atmospheric
mesh of 116x116 points requires 35 hours to provide the fire spread prediction. Obviously, this
configurations has no sense in terms of an operational system. So, a trade off should be find
between time and accuracy. A deeper study on this topic should be done and it is left for
another work.

Conclusions

WRF-SFIRE is a forest fire propagation simulator that couples a meteorological model (WRF)
and a forest fire propagation simulator (SFIRE). Since both models work reciprocally in a very
dynamic way, spatial and time resolution are critical to properly catch the interaction between
the two physical models. In this work, a real fire that took place in Catalonia (Spain) during
the summer of 2005 has been used as a case of study. Different initial data and internal meshes
discretization resolutions have been tested to determine which ones strongly affect the fire
propagation accuracy. As a result, one can conclude that the finer the atmospheric mesh, the
better the fire propagation prediction. However, as the atmospheric mesh resolutions increase,
larger execution times are obtained leading to execution times that should be avoided for
operational purposes. So, a more complete study about the trade off between accuracy and
time should be carried out to be able to use this data-driven system in operational situations.
