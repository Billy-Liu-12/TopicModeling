of the equation may be varied when a linear object becomes nonlinear. Finally, the parameters of the
nonlinear elements are subject to variations as well.
A typical example of practical problems with the uncertainties of the above-mentioned kind is as
follows. Consider a problem of technical diagnostics of a large class of quasi-stationary objects the
static parameters of which (measured at a fixed time moment t) satisfy the following equation
y  k  t  x.
(*)
Here, x and y are the input and output parameters, respectively, and the (unknown) function k  t  is
assumed to vary much slower than the input function x  x  t  . If the considered technical device is
damaged, the proportionality (*) is distorted and may follow the perturbed relationship

y k  x,t  x  b  t  ,
(**)
where b  t   0 .
The system of technical diagnostics should detect such deterioration and estimate its scale. The
easiest way to do that would be comparing the values of functions (*) and (**) for the same values of
x. However, since the ratio function k  t  in (*) for quasi-stationary objects uses to change randomly
its value with time, it becomes very difficult (if not impossible) to determine its value at a given time
point.
Because of its importance, the challenging problem of identification of dynamic objects has been
studied in many publications. Even though in the majority of works correlation methods, least squares
techniques, and the Fourier series expansion of signals are usually employed, new algorithms for
solving this problem appear regularly. For example, a structural parametric identification on the basis
of the multi-frequency quantization is described in (Kartashev et al., 2015). The simulation method
using correlative methods of identification is proposed in (Porkuyan and Kuznetsova, 2008). In
(Medvedev, 2000), the algorithms of identification of parameters and of object order are discussed. All
these methods are based on the recurrent observer derivatives. Some heuristic algorithms have also
been studied (Pervushin, 2013).
However, all those methods require the observation of processes during a certain time interval,
which is not always available. The main novelty of this paper is that we develop a new identification
method making use of only instantaneous values of the input-output processes and their derivatives.
This is done by exploiting the derivative disproportion functions (DDF) introduced previously in
(Avramenko, 2000; Avramenko and Zabolotny, 2009; Avramenko and Karpenko, 2002) whereas their
comprehensive description is found in (Kalashnikov et al., 2017).
The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 states the problem, while Section 3 defines
the derivative disproportion functions and lists dome of their important properties. The identification
algorithm is described in Section 4. Section 5 deals with a numerical example and the results of
numerical experiments. Section 6 presents the concluding remarks, while the acknowledgments and
the list of references finish the paper.

2 Problem Statement
Consider a quasi-stationary dynamic object with one input and one output whose behavior is
described by the differential equation
n
n 1
an y    an 1 y      a0 F  y  
x t  ,
(1)

where t denotes the time, x  t  and y  t  are the functions of input and output, respectively; and
finally, F is a nonlinear operator (element) that affects (converts) the function y  t  . The main

2101

characteristics of the latter operator (element) as well as the upper bound of the order of equation (1)
are assumed to be known.
In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the case, where both x  t  and y  t  are deterministic
processes, although it isn’t very difficult to examine more realistic noisy processes. The coefficients of
equation (1) may be accepted as constants during the process of identification.
It is necessary to identify the coefficients of equation (1) by making use of only instantaneous
values of input and output processes and their derivatives or to determine that there is a transient in the
current time. (The proposed method doesn’t identify the object during the transition process.) The task
is completed by exploiting the derivative disproportion functions (DDF) introduced previously in
(Avramenko, 2000; Avramenko and Zabolotny, 2009; Avramenko and Karpenko, 2002) and fully
described in (Kalashnikov et al., 2017). For the paper to be self-sufficient, the definitions and key
properties of these functions are presented in the following sections.

3 Derivative Disproportion Functions
In the competitive world of today, the value of information is constantly increasing and therefore,
it is necessary to encrypt this information in order to hide it from an unauthorized use. The latter aim
has led to the widespread use of cryptographic techniques within information systems, the most
famous of which are Data Encryption Standard (DES, 1999), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES,
2001), and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem (Rivets et al., 1978). But the new
powerful super-computers and the technologies of network and neural computing that have arisen
since 2000, bring up the revision of the previous cryptographic systems that had been considered as
absolutely reliable. Therefore, the development of new approaches to the creation of cryptosystems is
relevant.
Almost all cryptosystems use integers as keys. The greater the key length is, the more difficult it
is to “break” a cryptosystem by fitting a key or by solving a factorization problem. The transition from
integers to real numbers, or even better to real type functions is expected to considerably complicate
the task of cryptanalysis and to increase the stability of cryptosystems.
The new methods of classifying information can be developed on the basis of the use of
disproportion functions. Disproportion functions on the derivatives and on the values were proposed
and studied in (Avramenko, 2000; Avramenko and Zabolotny, 2009; Avramenko and Karpenko,
2002).
In this part of the paper, we recall the capability of such an approach for classifying and
declassifying of both analog signal and the signal in the form of a sequence of symbols from the
specified alphabet (Avramenko, 2000; Avramenko and Zabolotny, 2009). This cryptosystem is based
on the use of disproportion functions. The input symbols are encoded by the sum of real functions
(keys) combined with random coefficients. Due to the disproportion functions, there appeared an
opportunity to recognize the sum of which functions is included in the received signal at the current
moment, despite the unknown coefficients involved, and thus to recognize the encrypted symbols.
Derivative disproportion functions characterize numerical functions. They permit to obtain a
quantitative assessment of deviation of a numerical function from the power function y k  x n for a
given value of the argument, regardless of the multiplier k. Here n  1 is an integer.
The n-th order derivative disproportion of the function y  y  x  with respect to x ( x  0 ) is
defined as follows:
@ d (x n ) y 

y
xn



1 dny

n! dx n

2103

In the particular case of n  1 (order 1), formula (2) of the derivative disproportion is reduced

y dy
 .
(3)
x dx
As it could be expected, for the linear function y  kx its disproportion of order 1 is zero for any
value of the coefficient k. The symbol @ is chosen to designate the operation of determination of
disproportion. The symbol “d” is selected to refer to the function’s derivative as the main object of
disproportion calculated. Finally, the left-hand side of (3) is read “at d one y with respect to x”.
@ d (x1 ) y

If a function is specified in the parametric form, the n-th order derivative disproportion (2) is
dny

under the parametric dependence of y upon x.
dx n
In particular, the first-order derivative disproportion of the function defined parametrically as
x    t  and x    t  (where t is the parameter, and   t   0, '  t   0 ) has the form
determined by applying the rules of calculation of

y y'   t   '  t 

1
@ d x  y @ d t   t    t 

.

x x't   t   '  t 

(4)

Clearly if   t   k  t  for some constant k, its derivative disproportion (4) equals zero in all the
area in which the functions y    t  and x    t  are simultaneously defined.
Lemma 1 [7]. Every derivative disproportion function of order n boasts the following properties:
1. Multiplying the function y by any scalar k leads to scaling its derivative disproportion by the
same scalar.
2. The order n derivative disproportion of a sum (difference) of functions equals to the sum
(difference) of their derivative disproportion.
3. For the linear function y  kx , its derivative disproportion of order 1 is zero for any value of
the coefficient k.
Proof. It is readily verified by simple algebraic manipulations with the use of definition (2). ■
Remark 1. In other words, the operator @ d  n  defined on the space C n  of n times smoothly

differentiable real functions is linear over this space.

4 Identification Algorithm
Let us rewrite equation (1) in the form of the sum of key functions with unknown coefficients:
n

f0  t    ki f i  t ,

(5)

i 1

where by the function f 0 we denote the input process x, while the functions

fi f
i  t  ,i 1, 2 , ,n,

represent the output process y  t  and its derivatives. The identification problem applied to quasistationary dynamic objects can be illustrated with the following example.
Example 1. Consider a communication system transmitting symbols (signals) encoded with a
cryptosystem K based on key functions fi  fi  t  , each defined on a (time) interval
t   0,Ti  ,Ti  0,i 
1, ,m . The functions are assumed smooth and n times differentiable. A symbol
transmitted at the time moment t is encoded by the sum of (at least two) key functions with possible

Vyacheslav V. Kalashnikov et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 2100–2109

2104	

time delays (shifts)  i   0,Ti  ,i 
1, ,m. For example if the transmitted symbol is encoded as the sum
of two key functions f p and f q ,1  p,q  m, the signal transmitted to the communication channel has
been encoded as









y 
t  k p f p t   p  kq f q t   q ,k p  0,kq  0.

(6)

It is assumed that the invader (hacker) who may have got an unauthorized access to the channel is
informed of neither the key functions fi nor their time delays (shifts)  i , nor the coefficients
ki , i  p,q.
At the receiver end of the communication system, the full list of key functions and their delays is
known but which of them (and with what coefficients) are involved in the received signal (6) is to be
detected. The recognition of these functions and their coefficients in (6) permits to decode the current
symbol y  t  .
The problem of detecting both the key functions and their coefficients in (6) is solved by the
algorithm proposed in the next subsection.

4.1 Algorithm’s Description
The problem in question is hard to solve since the key functions and their coefficients can be
detected only approximately. The received message y  t  is expanded in time, so exact or

   j 0 ,

approximate derivatives of this function are needed. When the data are discrete, e.g., y t j

N 1

then the desired approximate “derivative” of the (discretized) function y  t  is found by a special
method, similar to that by Gregory-Newton (cf., Khan et al., 2003).
The algorithm is quite complicated, and due to the space restriction, here we present its
description for m  3 only (the complete version can be found in (Kalashnikov et al., 2017) and other
publications of the authors).
The main idea of the general algorithm is as follows: if the key function delays (shifts)
 i ,i  1 ,m , are known, we may represent the received message y  t  as the sum of all key
functions with yet unknown coefficients ki (for simplicity, assume that all delays are zero):
m

f0  t    k i f i  t  .

(7)

i 1

Then we have to calculate their coefficients at the current moment t. Coefficients will be equal to zero
for those functions that are not involved in the encrypted signal (7).
As we mentioned above, the description of the algorithm will be given for the case m  3 only.
The algorithm consists of m steps (that is, 3 in our case).
Step 1. Select arbitrarily one of the key functions, for instance, the first one f1  f1  t  . By making

use of (3) calculate the derivative disproportion for the signal f 0  t  and denote it as

1
F01  t  : @ d f f 0  t  . Besides, derivative disproportions F21(t) and F31(t) are calculated for the key
1

functions f 2  t  and f 3  t  with respect to f1  t  . Due to the linearity of operator @ (see, Remark 1),
formula (7) yields for m  3 :

 f1  t  f '1  t  
Here, the first term on the right-hand side of the upper line of (8) is zero due to assertion 3 of
Lemma 1.
Step 2. Again, pick up randomly one of the remaining derivative disproportions F21(t) and F31(t);
let it be, for instance, F21(t). Now we compute the derivative disproportions of the functions F01(t) and
F31(t) with respect to F21(t); denote them as F0121(t) and F3121(t), respectively.
Applying the operator of the derivative disproportion of order 1 to both sides of (8), making use
of its linearity and property 3 of Lemma 1 one easily gets
 F  t  F '31  t  
F  t  F '01  t 

F21  t  F '21  t 
 F21  t  F '21  t  
Step 3. Relationship (9) shows the linear dependence of the function F0121 on the function F3121.
Therefore, based on property 3 of Lemma 1, we conclude that the derivative disproportion function
F01213121(t) of the function F0121 with respect to F3121 is zero for all feasible t:
F
 t   F '0121  t   k  k  0.

(10)
3
3
3121
F3121  t  F '3121  t 
Now one can use relations (8) and (9) in the reverse order and calculate the desired values of the
unknown coefficients ki . Indeed, first from (9) one readily gets
F0121
;
F3121
the latter, in its turn, together with (8) implies:
F k F
k2  01 3 31 .
F21
k3 

(11)

(12)

Finally, by substituting the just found k2 and k3 in (7), one deduces the value of k1 :
k1 

y  t   k2 f 2  t   2   k3 f 3  t   3 
.
f1  t  1 

(13)

The algorithm stops having decoded the received message (quasi-stationary dynamic object) f 0  t  by
having detected the unknown coefficients associated with the involved key functions. All coefficients
related to the non-used key functions are zero. The object has been identified.
■
Remark 2. If the disproportion (10) isn’t equal to zero, it is necessary to check the following
points:
1 There may be a transient process in the object. When this process is finished, the disproportion
will be equal to zero.
2 A non-linearity has appeared in the object, or the parameters of the nonlinear element have
been changed.
3 The order of the equation is greater than it was previously estimated.
■

Vyacheslav V. Kalashnikov et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 2100–2109

2106	

This algorithm can be used for rapid identification of quasi-stationary dynamic objects if the
input and output processes are smooth. No interferences are allowed.
Remark 3. As it can be easily concluded, the knowing of the list of involved functions and their
delay (shift) values  i is indispensable for the implementation of this simplified version of the
decoding algorithm. The more sophisticated procedures that may be needed to decipher the received
message in the lack of such important information are described in (Avramenko, 2000; Avramenko
and Zabolotny, 2009).

5 Numerical Illustration
The efficiency of the developed algorithm was tested by using computer simulations. Namely,
consider the Duffing equation that is employed for describing many kinds of nonlinear objects:
d2x
dx
 2
 02 x 
hx3 G cos  1t    ,
(14)
2
dt
dt
where t is the time variable, x (t) is a system’s deviation from the initial state,  is a dissipation factor
(damping), 0 and h are the coefficients depending on the system parameters, and finally, G,1 , are
the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the external influence.
Before modeling, the values of coefficients and parameters of external influence were specified
randomly in equation (14). Then the Cauchy problem was solved by the use of Runge-Kutta method of
the 4th order with the step time equal to 0.01s. The processes x(t) and dx/dt were thus numerically

obtained. The second derivative d 2 x dt 2 was calculated with the aid of the Newton-Stirling numerical
method using the first derivative.

The coefficients of the differential equation that were first defined and that calculated are
shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Coefficients (defined and calculated) of the differential equation

The minor deviations are associated with the choice of the time quantization step for modeling and
calculation of derivatives.
Figure 1 shows a plot of the derivative disproportion function (DDF) (10) if the parameter
2𝛼 changed abruptly from 0.23 to 0.35 when the time is equal to 0.57 seconds. As a result, the DDF
(10) has stopped being zero.

At the end of the transition process, the values of DDF (11) are again equal to zero, and the
coefficient k3=0.35 is constant.

Figure 2 depicts the change of the ratio k3 from 0.23 to 0.38 in the time interval 0.57 to 0.72. On
this interval, the DDF (10) wasn’t zero, so it is impossible to calculate the coefficients of equation (7).
However, at the end of the transition process, the DDF (10) again becomes zero, and the coefficient k3
received the constant value of 0.38.

These minor fluctuations of the values of k3 are the result of numerical differentiation with the use
6-order differences.
Those examples demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s performance. According to the rapidly
detected fluctuations and their derivatives, the algorithm is robust and allows one to implement
efficiently the operational control of the parameters of dynamic systems.

6 Concluding Remarks
The determination of a differential equation that describes a dynamic object is a very important
and challenging task. An additional requirement of minimization of the time necessary for solving that
task is quite frequent.
A plenty of various numerical algorithms has been developed to solve the identification problem.
However, all those methods require the observation of processes during a certain time interval, which
is not always possible. The main novelty of this paper is in that we propose a new identification
method making use of only instantaneous values of the input-output processes and their derivatives.
The task is completed by exploiting the derivative disproportion functions (DDF) introduced
previously in (Avramenko, 2000; Avramenko and Zabolotny, 2009; Avramenko and Karpenko, 2002)
and comprehensively described in (Kalashnikov et al., 2017).
Namely, we propose a cryptosystem where real functions are used as keys. The example is
provided to illustrate the operation of such a system where symbols are encoded by the sum of the key
functions with random coefficients. Decryption occurs with the help of the first order derivative
disproportion functions calculated for the received signal and the key functions.
For a practical application of such cryptosystems, one should bear in mind that in the process of
calculation of the coefficients during decoding, there may arise examples of division by small
numbers, or a ratio of two numbers both close to zero. This can lead to information distortion.
Therefore, the encrypted message must be decoded before it is transmitted to a communication
channel. If necessary, the message must be encrypted once again with other coefficients in the hope
that the generator of random numbers varies the obtained coefficients of the key functions.
