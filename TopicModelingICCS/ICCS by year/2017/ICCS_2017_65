values of the model parameters. We investigate, if incorporation of the assessment of the agents’
waiting decisions into their decision-making process used in [3]-[5], which was based only on the
assessment of their crossing decisions, improves the agents’ success in crossing.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the model focusing on agents’
decision-making algorithms; Section 3 describes how agents’ decision formulas affect the relative
frequency of numbers of successful, killed and queued agents at simulation end, and Section 4 reports
our conclusions and outlines future work.

2 Model of Agents Learning to Cross a CA Based Highway
For the full description of the model the reader is referred to [3]-[5]. Here, we focus on the agents’
decision-making formulas used by them in their decision-making process of crossing a highway. We
assume that the agents (1) want to learn how to cross a single lane unidirectional highway without
being hit/killed by the oncoming vehicles; (2) are capable of approximating distances and velocities of
moving vehicles; (3) witness what had happened to the agents that previously crossed the highway at
their crossing point (CP); (4) can imitate the agents which crossed successfully; (5) can decide not to
cross and wait for better conditions, or look for a different CP when unsuccessful crossings outnumber
the successful ones. These allow each CP to build one knowledge base (KB) during the experiment
that is available to all agents at that CP.
We model the highway traffic by adopting the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton (CA)
model, for details see [3]-[7]. An agent is generated only at a CP set at the initialization step and is
placed into the queue at this CP. Each generated agent falls with equal probability (0.25) into one of
the four categories: (1) no Fear nor Desire; (2) only Fear; (3) only Desire; (4) both Fear and Desire.
These attributes of agents play a role in their decision-making process of crossing the highway through
the values of Fear (aversion to risk taking) and Desire (propensity to risk taking) that an agent may
experience. The agents, within their limited horizon of vision, can perceive only fuzzy levels of speed
(e.g., slow, medium, fast, very fast) and of distance (e.g., close, medium, far). At a CP, the agents
build up in the queue until the one at the top of the queue, called an active agent, decides to cross, or if
a simulation setup permits, moves with probability 1/3 right or left to a different location to attempt to
cross from there.
Each active agent must make one of the following two decisions: Crossing Decision (CD) or
Waiting Decision (WD). If an active agent decides to cross it may either succeed, we call such
crossing decision Correct Crossing Decision (CCD), or it may be hit/killed, and we call such crossing
decision Incorrect Crossing Decision (ICD). Similarly, each WD of an active agent can be assessed as:
Correct Waiting Decision (CWD), this is the case when, if the agent did not wait and chose to cross, it
would be hit; or Incorrect Waiting Decision (IWD), this is the case when, the agent chose to wait but it
would cross the highway successfully. The assessment of each decision of an active agent, i.e. if the
decision was CCD, ICD, CWD, or IWD, is recorded, respectively, as a count in the Knowledge-Based
(KB) table of all agents waiting at CP of the active agent. Thus, the KB table is associated with each
CP.
Each KB table is organized as a matrix with an extra row entry, corresponding to agents’ out of
range vision, i.e. the situation in which an active agent cannot perceive if outside its horizon of vision
there is a car and if it is, what is its velocity. The columns names are slow, medium, fast and very fast
and the rows names are close, medium and far. At each time t, each entry (including the extra row
entry) of the KB table contains four numbers; each of them corresponds to a type of decision made by
the active agents up to time t-1. These numbers are: number of CCDs, ICDs, CWDs and IWDs. The
KB table is initialized in the same way as in [3]-[5]. After the initialization of a simulation, each active
agent consults the KB table to decide if it is safe or not to cross. Its decision is based on the
implemented intelligence/decision-making algorithm, which for a given (distance, velocity) pair or out

of range vision combines the success ratio of crossing the highway for the observed situation with the
agents’ Fear and/or Desire parameters’ values. The main simulation loop of the model is described in
[3]-[5].
The decision-making process of described in [3]-[5] considers only the outcomes of CDs. Since the
number of successful agents equals the number of CCDs, and the number of killed agents equals the
number of ICDs, we call the decision formula (DF) of [3]-[5] as Crossing Based Decision Formula
(cDF) and for each 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 #$ entry of the KB table at time 𝑡𝑡 (out of range entry is denoted by (0,0)) the
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷() 𝑡𝑡 of DF is calculated as follows:
																																												𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑣𝑣 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 − 𝑣𝑣 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 ,																																		(1)

where 𝑣𝑣(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷) and 𝑣𝑣(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹) are the values of the active agent Fear and Desire parameters, and
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() (𝑡𝑡) is the Crossing Based Success Ratio (cSR) corresponding to the 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 #$ entry of the KB table,
which is defined as follows:
																														𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 = 	 {𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 − 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 } 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶#>#?@ 𝑡𝑡 − 1 .																					 2

The terms 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() (𝑡𝑡 − 1) and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() (𝑡𝑡 − 1) are, respectively, the numbers of CCDs and ICDs recorded
in the 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 #$ entry of the KB table at time 𝑡𝑡. The term 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶#>#?@ (𝑡𝑡 − 1) is the sum of numbers of all the
CCDs over all the entries of the KB table. After the initialization, if 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0, then an active agent
will cross. If 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 < 0, then the active agent will wait and additionally it may move to another
crossing point, if the simulation setup permits.
The Crossing-and-Waiting Based Decision Formula (cwDF) incorporates the assessment of both
CDs and WDs of the active agents. The formula cwDF is obtained from cDF formula by replacing the
term 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 	by the term 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 	in the cDF formula (1). The term 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 ,	 called Crossingand-Waiting Based Success Ratio (cwSR), is defined for each 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 entry of the KB table at time 𝑡𝑡 as
follows:
𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 = {𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 − 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 − 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 	 + 	 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() (𝑡𝑡 − 1)}/𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 − 1 ,						(3)	
															
where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 , 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() (𝑡𝑡 − 1), 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() (𝑡𝑡 − 1) are, respectively the numbers of
CCDs, ICDs, CWDS and IWDs in the KB table entry 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, recorded up to time 𝑡𝑡 − 1. The term
𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 − 1 is the sum of the numbers of all the decision types recorded in all the entries of the KB table
up to time 𝑡𝑡 − 1,	i.e.
											𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡 − 1 =

() {𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶()

𝑡𝑡 − 1 + 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 + 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼() 𝑡𝑡 − 1 }.											(4)

Thus, the formula cwDF can be written as

																																															𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑣𝑣 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 − 	𝑣𝑣 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 .																																						(5)		

An active agent decides to cross the highway only when 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐() ≥ 0. Otherwise, the active agent will
wait and additionally it may move to another crossing point, if the simulation setup allows this.

3 Simulation Results
For each DF type, i.e. cDF and cwDF, two data sets were generated with the same values of the
other parameters. The constant values of the parameters in the simulations were: (1) the single lane
highway of the length of 120 cells; (2) the CP set at the cell 60 at the initialization step; (3) duration of
1511 time steps of each simulation run; (4) 30 repetitions of each simulation set up. A car was
perceived as: close if it was 0 to 5 cells away, medium far if it was 6 to 10 cells away, far if it was 11
to 15 cells away and out of range if it was 16 or more cells away, regardless of the true velocity of the
car. If the velocity of a car was 0 to 3 cells, 4 or 5 cells, 6 or 7 cells, or 8 to 11 cells per time step, then
the car was perceived, respectively, as slow, medium speed, fast, or very fast. A car’s max speed was
set as 11 cells per time step.

Figure 1: Relative frequency of numbers of queued agents (called creatures) at simulation end calculated,
respectively, for four types of simulations with HM=0. These frequencies are defined by the following
parameters’ setups: (cDF, KBT=0), (cDF, KBT=1), (cwDF, KBT=0), (cwDF, KBT=1). The legend box describes
the correspondence between the bar plots and the frequencies “f” depending on the setup of these parameters. The
“nKBt” stands for (KBT=0) and “KBt” stands for (KBT=1) in the legend box.

There are 6 parameters values of which vary through the main simulation loop. These parameters
are: (1) car creation probability, i.e. CCP, taking values: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9; (2) Fear and
Desire parameters, each taking values: 0.00, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.00; (3) the KB transfer direction
parameter KBT, which can be set as: “none” (KBT=0), or “forward” (KBT=1). This parameter
determines if the KB table of the initial CP can be transferred (KBT=1) or not (KBT=0) at the end of a
simulation run with lower CCP value to the beginning of a simulation run with immediately higher
value of CCP. For details see, [3]-[5]; (4) random deceleration RD, when RD=1, the speed of each car
is decreased randomly with probability 0.5, when RD=0 this is not allowed; (5) an active agent (called
also a creature) horizontal movement HM, which can take value 0 or 1. If HM=1, then an active
agents can move to a different CP, but not further away than 5 cells, if HM=0 this is not allowed.
When HM=0, the maximum number of the successful agents can be only 50% of all the generated
agents (i.e., 755 in our case). This is due to the model design, as it takes 2 time steps for an active
agent to cross the highway. Setting HM=1 removes this 50% bound on the maximum number of
successful agents. Therefore, for the analysis the simulation data is split further by the parameter HM.

	

Anna T. Lawniczak et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 2443–2447

For both DFs, the numbers of killed agents (creatures), at simulation ends are always very small
(i.e., less than 50) in comparison with 1511 generated creatures. Because of this, when the number of
successful creatures is small the number of queued creatures is big and vice versa. Here, we analyse
how cDF and cwDF effects creatures’ performance by looking only at the relative frequencies of
numbers of queued creatures at simulation end, when HM=0. These frequencies are calculated as
follow: we divide the interval from 0 to 1511 into the following subintervals: [0, 250], (250, 500],
(500, 750], (750, 1000], (1000, 1250], and (1250, 1511]. Then, at simulation end in each data subset of
queued creatures we count how many times the number of queued creatures falls into each subinterval.
For the display, we normalize the obtained numbers by dividing them by the total number of the
individual simulation runs in the entire data subset and display the obtained relative frequencies as
percentages. Given that for HM=0, the maximum number of successful creature at simulation end
cannot be bigger than 755, this implies that for HM=0, most of the numbers of queued creatures at
simulation end are bigger than 750, as Figure 1 shows. Additionally, this figure shows that when
cwDF is used most numbers of queued creatures at simulation end (i.e., 61.2% when KBT=0 and
87.9% when KBT=1) are between 750 and 1000, while when cDF is used most of these numbers (i.e.,
71.2% when KBT=0 and 67% when KBT=1) are between 1250 and 1511. Thus, the use of cwDF
improves the creatures’ performance by decreasing the numbers of queued creatures. We notice that
the KB transfer has stronger effect on creatures’ performance for cDF than cwDF. In general, the use
of cwDF leads to smaller (bigger) numbers of queued (successful) creatures at simulation ends,
regardless if the KB transfer takes place or not. This confirms that the inclusion of the assessment of
creatures WDs into their DF improves their performance, which is further enhanced by transfer of KB.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
The presented work shows that the incorporation of the assessment of agents waiting decisions into
their decision-making formula, improves the agents’ performance, i.e. it increases the numbers of
agents crossing the highway successfully by decreasing the numbers of queuing agents attempting to
cross without affecting the numbers of killed agents. The coupling of the decision formula based on
crossing and waiting decisions outcomes with agents’ knowledge base transfer further improves
agents’ performance. We plan to explore other types of decision-making algorithms and study the
agents’ performance for them.
