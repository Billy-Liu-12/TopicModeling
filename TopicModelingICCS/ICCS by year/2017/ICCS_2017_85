2 Problem statement
The problem of the development of tourist areas and places of attraction has been widely studied
since 1980s, when the concept of tourist area cycle of evolution was proposed [4]. The most part of
articles, devoted to this topic, perform theoretical analysis of the target area [5] or use statistical methods
of analyzing tourists [6]. These methods work well for relatively small cases and for particular areas,
but with the development of the Internet and photo-sharing networks, like Instagram, researchers now
can investigate the activity of the people in the tourist areas on the much larger scale. We can collect a
large amount of posts from the social network to see, if there are any differences in the behavior of local
citizens and tourists.
In Figure 1 the density map of Instagram photos, taken by locals and residents in Saint Petersburg
in 2016, is presented. We can see that the clear majority of tourists’ photos is located in the city center,
mostly along the main street – Nevsky prospect. Popular places of residents are scattered throughout the
city area. Saint Petersburg was chosen as the target city of the research, because it is a cultural and
touristic center. In 2016 the city was awarded as the World's Leading Cultural City Destination and
Europe's Leading Destination3. Thus, we can say that there is no better place in Russia to study the
differences in behavior of tourists and residents.

3 Proposed solution
Data crawling. For the analysis of users’ activity on the Instagram, we require full profiles of users,
which include user’s information and all his or her posts with geolocation of posts where available. At
the first step, we collected a sample of posts made in Saint Petersburg in the period of two months in
2016 – February and November. These two months were chosen because they represent periods of low
tourist activity4 and this fact allows to collect more posts of local users. The crawling of posts was
initiated at four points of interest: three parks at the north, east and south of the city and the cultural
center of Saint Petersburg – the Hermitage. Instagram entries were collected within the 5 km radius
around these points, which allowed to cover the major part of the city. After that, we extracted all
usernames from the collected dataset and collected full profiles for these users.
Detection of city residents. One of the most common ways to discover city visitors is to check the
time periods of posted photos [7]. If someone posts pictures in the target location only in a specific time
frame, he or she is considered as a tourist. However, usage of the approach with small time frames would
result into situations, when tourists with relatively long vacations would be classified as citizens. Since
the main idea of our research is to analyze the most popular places among locals, we need to use more
accurate way to detect city residents. It was decided to expand the described approach with the use of
official tourist statistics. By information from the administration of Saint Petersburg, the largest number
of tourists comes from the European Union (32%). According to Eurostat5, average duration of the

outbound vacations of European citizens mostly does not exceed 14 days (87% of trips). Overall length
of vacations and holidays for one year is no longer than 28 days. These result in a strategy for identifying
a person as a tourist if his or her posts in Saint Petersburg during a calendar year can be covered by two
15-days long time windows with a gap between the windows at least 30 days. Illustration of this concept
is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Illustration of time windows strategy
Thus, in our analysis, the user is considered as local if he or she fits at least one of the following
criteria:
1. Profile description or username contains information that user is located in Saint Petersburg;
2. User is considered as local according to the strategy described above.
Despite all aforementioned rules, some visitors still could be associate as locals. It could happen if
someone visits city repeatedly with short periods of staying. But repeating visitors are known to choose
favorite places, stay longer and explore their destination in details [8]. Also repeaters are more likely to
live nearby and travel on the weekends [9]. Thus, suchlike tourists could be fairly considered as locals.
In addition to that, tourists with long vacations would be also identified as locals. During the first days
of staying they would likely visit all the most popular touristic places and start to explore new areas.
Location filtering. Since we are particularly interested in revealing of new promising locations,
some preliminary data processing is required. Instagram application allows users to set up location of
the photo by typing it. It provides some difficulties with a location distinction: different places can have
similar names, some names have typos, etc. Different places having the same location are united, and
all locations inside of 120 meters radius are considered as one place with an aggregated statistics. After
that, we compare the most popular places for both groups – tourists and locals. Place is considered as
popular if it was visited by at least 100 different users during one calendar year. Top 15 tourists’ places
are considered as well known and excluded from the analysis. Places corresponding to large areas like
satellite towns, city districts and locations, related to transport infrastructure, i.e. subway stations and
railway stations, are also eliminated from the analysis.
Detection of popular places. On the next step, all locations are divided into clusters per their weekly
visiting dynamics. For each day of the week total number of users, who visited the place, was calculated
and for every place the dynamics was normalized to reveal a clear dynamics pattern. To group locations
by similar dynamics, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering was chosen. This method has shown its
efficiency in social networks analysis [10] and it could be successfully used to cluster time series of
equal length [11]. Squared Euclidean distance was used to measure the distance to enlarge the distance
between different locations and shorten it for similar locations. The optimal number of clusters is defined
by the Dunn index [12]: index is calculated for the range between 2 and 30 and after that the lowest
number with highest value is picked as a solution. Finally, top 10% of places from each cluster is
considered as a result and potential attraction points. The list combines the places of different types
covering all possible kinds of dynamics, thus tourists would be able to choose a location by their own
preferences and interests.

4 Experimental part
The collected dataset contains 529 251 posts with geolocation in 17 921 unique places in Saint
Petersburg. 23 596 users were classified as locals. To testify the time windows method, a sample of 150
random profiles was taken from the dataset. The correctness of classifying as tourists or locals was
checked manually. Results of the verification showed that if user is defined as a local, he almost certain
local (type I error is 6.25%). Meanwhile, some users due to their low posting activity are marked as

tourists. This happens mostly in two cases: (1) User do not use geo location functionality: only few
photos contain geotags; (2) User tends to post photos from other places: majority of photos from profile
are taken in places outside Saint Petersburg. Thus, current implementations of the time windows method
meet certain limitations: it can be successfully used to detect only active users of Instagram and it can
fail to identify frequent travelers. However, our research is focused on the city and its active residents,
which constantly explore the city.
The comparison of weekly dynamics during a year seasons is presented on Figure 3. During winter
and fall, there is a lot of similarities between profiles of tourists and locals, since people visit Saint
Petersburg mostly on weekends. In contrast, in summer tourists tend to stay on a longer period, which
results in higher level of activity during the working days, whereas locals post more photos during
weekends. The lowest value on Tuesday in summer and fall periods could be related to the day off in
museums cultural places.

Figure 3. Tourists and locals’ day-of-week dynamics by season.
On the next step, filtered locations list of locals’ popular places was analyzed to reveal potential
attraction points. As a result of clustering, there were obtained 26 clusters with different weekly
dynamics. These clusters were combined into four groups (Figure 4): the first group is the places with a
stable high level of activity. The second group corresponds to places with rather high weekends’
dynamics compared to working days. The third group demonstrates upward trend during working days
and sharp decrease during weekends. And the fourth group represents places with a peak of activity in
one of the working days and the lower level of posts in weekends.

Figure 4. Groups of day-of-week dynamics’ clusters.
Top 10% of popular places among locals were taken from each cluster. Thus, there were obtained
44 popular locations in 2016. The recommended places could be divided into 5 categories: cultural

locations (theatres, museums and circuses), restaurants (bars and café), interesting city locations
(bridges, parts of streets, etc.), parks and others (creative spaces, studios, etc.).

5 Conclusion and future works
The main contribution of this work is a method for revealing new potential attraction points for
tourists in a large city. We presented an extension for tourist and locals detection from social media data
by using time frames. This approach allows to identify the person without complete information and full
profile. Saint Petersburg was used as an example: top places for visitors and residents were compared
and the results showed that tourists and locals have different activity trends during the year. In summer,
tourists are more active during a week compared to other seasons. Conversely, during a winter season
tourists and locals have rather similar dynamics, which leads us to the idea that places popular among
citizens could be interesting for tourists as well. After analysis, the list of potential interesting locations
was presented. However, there are several steps to enhance these results. One of direction to improve
this work is to take into consideration social interactions between users, i.e. likes and comments.
Obviously, pictures with many likes are representing something interesting to other users, thus place,
where photo was taken, could be potential point of interest for tourists. Presence of comments does not
guarantee social approval; however, it shows users’ concernment. Usage of sentiment analysis for
comments can allow to endorse an accuracy of posts evaluation. Some location with a low density of
photos could be considered potentially interesting in case of big resonance in social response.
