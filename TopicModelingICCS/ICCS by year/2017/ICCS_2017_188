1 Introduction
Concrete is one of the most widely used construction material in all around the world with its
remarkably high compressive strength, which is widely accepted as the principal indicator of the level
of quality of concrete (Neville, 2005). Concrete is manufactured by mixing cement, water, fine
aggregates and coarse aggregates in certain proportions to obtain a desired strength. Civil engineering
standards propose the determination of concrete’s compressive strength using destructive procedures,
in which concrete samples are subjected to gradually increasing compressive stress in a laboratory
environment until the sample is fractured. Therefore, finding a fast and efficient non-destructive method
to predict the ultimate strength of concrete as an alternative to laborious destructive experiment using
numerous materials with varying properties and mix proportions, would constitute a marginal progress
in this field. In this paper we propose using an artificial neural (ANN) for this purpose.
ANNs have been used in various successful applications over the past 3 decades. Examples of these
vastly distributed application areas include the works in (Khashman & Sekeroglu, 2005; Khashman,
2006; Khashman, 2008; Khashman, 2009; Khashman & Nwulu, 2011; Khashman, 2012). However,
applications of neural networks in civil engineering tasks have been limited in comparison with other
engineering application fields; yet some researchers demonstrated efficient successful results in this
emerging application field. These include the studies in (I-Cheng, 1998; Basyigit et al, 2010; Deepa et
al., 2010; Hakim et al., 2011; Kostic et al, 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Akpinar & Uwanuakwa, 2016).
In this work, we present a novel neural network-based intelligent system that will be trained to
classify the grade of different concrete mixes by predicting their compressive strength value, which is
influenced by certain input attributes. Our hypothesis is that these attributes or elements have a nonlinear relationship with the compressive strength (quality of cement), thus it is an ideal task to model
this relationship using a neural model. This, together with the availability of a large database for our
implementation, makes sufficient grounds for using the popular and simple, yet effective, back
propagation neural network learning algorithm. Furthermore, we train our proposed neural prediction
model using several learning schemes; based on varying the ratio of training-to-testing datasets, in order
to obtain an optimum learning scheme for this application.

2 Dataset Processing
The dataset used in this study is a benchmark publicly available online dataset (UCI, 2017). This
dataset contains 1030 instances with a total number of nine quantitative. There are no missing values
reported by the dataset providers. The original input attributes are listed in Table 1. Prior to using these
attributes with the neural model, all values in the dataset must be normalized to numerical values
between 0 and 1. This requirement is necessary when using neural networks since every neuron within
the entire network is designed to receive values between 0 and 1 (Khashman, 2006). The data
preprocessing; i.e. attribute normalization as well as output data coding, will be explained in detail in
the following subsection.
Prior to data preprocessing and coding we introduce here an additional input parameter to this
dataset, which is extracted by using the existing parameters thus maintaining the homogeneity of the
expanded dataset. Our extra input parameter; namely water/binder ratio will be the 9th input attribute.
This ninth input is proposed here since water/binder ratio has a direct influence on the strength on
concrete mixes. The term “binder” is calculated by simply summing the values of cement, fly ash and
slag. 1030 values for this ratio are calculated accordingly, normalized together with the rest of input
attributes, and then added to the dataset. The Output attribute (Y1), which represents the compression
strength is not normalized in this manner; instead the output strength values are coded using three digit
binary values to model three distinguished classifications that are commonly used in civil engineering.

high strength.

Having preprocessed the concrete dataset values, it is now ready for neural network arbitration,
which is the second phase in our proposed intelligent classification system.

3 The Neural Model Design
A supervised ANN learns in two stages: training and testing. During training input data values (A1A9 in this work) are fed in parallel to the ANN input layer while their corresponding output (Y1 in this
work) is given as a target or desired output at the output layer. Testing the trained neural model
comprises only one forward pass using the saved latest weights or memory of the model. Our supervised
ANN model has three layers: input layer with nine neurons receiving normalized values of A1-A9 input
data attributes, a hidden layer with six neurons that was determined after several experiments that aimed
at minimizing the error value and adjusting the number of hidden neurons. Other parameters that were
also adjusted include the learning coefficient () which reflects the learning capability of the
ANN, and the momentum rate (α = 0.79) which reflects the speed of learning. The output layer has three
neurons representing the 3-digit binary coding of the compressive strength output value Y1.

4 Implementation, Results and Discussions
Three different learning schemes are suggested for implementing the neural network prediction
model. The difference between the learning schemes is the ratio of training-to-testing datasets. In total
the dataset contains 1030 instances of concrete mixes. We consider the balanced 50:50 ratio as well as
two offset ratios by 10 lower and higher such that the three learning schemes are based on: 40:60, 50:50
and 60:40 training-to-testing data ratios. Table 2 shows the obtained results when training and testing
the neural network model following the suggested learning schemes. In all experiments the maximum
number of iterations was set to 20000 in order to maintain low computational costs. Upon inspecting
Table 2, it is noted that the highest obtained correct prediction rate (CPR) for training dataset was
96.31% following learning scheme LS2. On the other hand, the highest CPR for testing dataset was
76.21% and learning scheme LS3. However, the highest overall CPR was recorded as 86.02% when
using LS2; therefore, we propose a neural prediction model trained under learning scheme LS2.
When comparing our novel concrete compressive strength prediction model to previously published
similar works (Basyigit et al., 2010; Atici et al., 2011; Hakim et al., 2011; Kostic et al, 2015; Chopra et
al., 2016) it is evident that our system outperforms these works in many factors. For example, the dataset
size is considerably smaller in all the above works compared to our dataset of 1030 instances. All
previous works had one learning scheme, which was marginally unbalanced and biased to training phase

where such practices often reflect higher but unrealistic performance. All the above works used less
input attributes than this work. Finally, none of these works considered a solution for the classification
sensitivity of the neural network output; all previous works used a single neuron at the output to deliver
an exact reading for the compressive strength. We instead, proposed in this paper a 3-digit binary coding
solution to allow the neural model some flexibility in decision making, only to assure a more accurate
output classification.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a novel non-destructive prediction system for classifying the compressive
strength of concrete into low, moderate and high strength. We used a large publicly available concrete
mixes dataset for implementing our prediction system, and suggested three learning schemes to
implement the system. We then compared the performance of our intelligent prediction system to
previously published works with a similar mission. Our comparison criteria was based on vital factors
in computational intelligence and machine learning, such as; the correct prediction rate, the minimum
error, the size of the dataset, the number of input attributes for training the system, the data preprocessing
and coding, and finally the learning schemes.
From the numerical results; as discussed in section 4, we deduce that our proposed intelligent
prediction and classification system outperforms the previous recent works. The novelty in our work is
threefold: firstly, using a large dataset of 1030 instances, and optimizing the learning scheme of the
neural prediction model by using a balanced data distribution of 50:50 training-to-testing ratio; secondly,
adding a 9th input attribute (water/binder ratio) that has a significant effect on the compressive strength
of concrete; and thirdly, using a 3-digit binary coding method to represent the single value reading of
compressive strength. Further work will involve investigating more learning schemes, employing
different neural models and improving the correct prediction rate.
