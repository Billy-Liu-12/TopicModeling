non–equilibrium eﬀects in the capillary pressure can be signiﬁcant. For instant, ﬂow in some
industrial porous media, such as paper pulp drying process (Lewalle et al. [8]). Recently,
many experimental studies on the dynamics capillary pressure have been introduced [11, 10]. A
comprehensive review surveyed the experimental works in which non–equilibrium eﬀects have
been observed [5]. Moreover, other computational studies on dynamics capillary pressure using
Darcy–scale models have been also introduced [9, 3]. In the case of two–phase ﬂow in porous
media, the capillary pressure relationship under non–equilibrium conditions is determined using
future water saturation.
The model of two-phase ﬂuid ﬂow in porous media is a coupled system of nonlinear timedependent partial diﬀerential equations. The IMplicit Pressure Explicit Saturation (IMPES)
approach solves the pressure equation implicitly and updates the saturation explicitly. The
instability of the IMPES method results of the decoupling between the pressure equation and
the saturation equation as well as the explicit treatment of the capillary pressure [2]. Iterative
IMPES splits the equation system into an equation for pressure and another saturation equation
that are solved sequentially as IMPES [4]. A linear approximation of capillary function is
introduced to couple the implicit saturation equation into pressure equation [7]. In this work,
we modiﬁed the IMPES scheme introduced in [7] to solve the ﬂow equation of the model with
the dynamic capillary pressure.

Modeling and Mathematical Formulation

In this section, a mathematical model is developed to describe the two-phase ﬂow in porous
media including the dynamic capillary pressure. Consider two–phase immiscible incompressible
ﬂow in a porous medium which is governed by the Darcy’s law and the equations of mass
conservation for each phase as,
∂ (φSα )
+ ∇ · u α = qα ,
∂t

uα = −

krα
K∇pα ,
μα

α = w, n.

(1)

where Sα is the saturation, uα is the velocity of the phase α. w stands for the wetting phase,
and n stands for the nonwetting phase. φ is the porosity of the medium, qα is the external mass
ﬂow rate. K is the absolute permeability tensor chosen as K = kI, I is the identity matrix
and k is a positive real number. krα is the relative permeability, ρα is the density, and pα
is the pressure, μα is the viscosity of the phase α. The ﬂuid saturations for the wetting and
non-wetting are interrelated by, Sw + Sn = 1. Now, we describe the governing equations used
in [7] as,
− ∇ · λt K∇pw − ∇ · λn K∇pc = qw + qn .
(2)
and
∂ (φSα )
− qw = −∇ · (fw ua ) .
∂t

(3)

where fw = λw /λt is the ﬂow fraction, λα = krα /μα is the mobility.
The classical capillary pressure–saturation relationship based on the thermodynamic equilibrium assumption, is commonly given as, pn − pw = ps (Sw ). For non-equilibrium conditions,
the following equation for the ﬂuids pressure diﬀerence has been suggested (Hassanizadeh and
Gray [6]),
∂Sw
pn − pw = ps (Sw ) − τ (Sw )
.

where τ is a non-equilibrium capillarity coeﬃcient (material property) that may be a function
of saturation and other ﬂuid–ﬂuid properties. The dynamic capillary pressure may be written
as,

Solution Method

Deﬁne the time step length Δtn = tn+1 − tn , the total time interval [0, T ] may be divided into
NT time steps as 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tNT = T . The current time step is represented by
the superscript n + 1, while the current time step is represented by the superscript n. The
backward Euler time discretization is used for the equation of saturation. The discretized
governing equations can be given as,

each spatial point is varies with time. At the same time, the saturation is smoothly changing
along with time at each spatial point even if it is discontinuously distributed in space. Moreover,
the CCFD discretization of the saturation equation is,

Stability Analysis

The dynamic capillarity parameter τB , has the main eﬀect on the stability of this scheme. In the
following analysis, the eﬀect of saturation error on the matrices Aw , Aa and Ac is neglected and
the capillary pressure is concentrated. Now we need to consider the propagation of numerical
errors from time step n to time step (n + 1). Local truncation error is not considered here.

matrix. Consequently, the scheme (I) is stable if the following condition holds, ρ (C) < 1,
ρ(C) is the spectral radius of the matrix C, i.e. all of the eigenvalues of this matrix must lie
within the unit circle in the complex plane. Theoretically, this condition is computable, but
practically it is too expensive to compute for guiding the choice of Δtn . We assume that a
square domain is partitioned into one cell. As the results of the discretization of CCFD, all
the matrices M, Aw , Aa and Ac become positive scalar numbers and so is H. The stability
condition becomes,

τB
This means that the scheme is stable for all Δt
n ≥ 0.5. It is interesting to note that this scheme
n
is stable naturally because τB >> Δt , τB is of order 105 − 107 . For the case of the static
capillary pressure (τB = 0), a small time step size is often required to attain the stability of
IMPES.

Results

Here we introduce an example to test the performance of the presented scheme. Consider the
capillary pressure formula, ps = −Bc log(S), Bc = 50 bar. The viscosities of water and oil
are 1 cP and 0.45 cP, respectively. The injection rate is 0.1 PV/year and we continue the
calculation until 0.5 PVI, with the time step, 0.01 day. The porosity is taken as 0.1 while the
permeability is 1 md. In this example, we run the simulation for the static τB =0 and the
dynamic pressure, τB >0. Fig. 1 (left) represents the water saturation proﬁles after 5 days of
injection for the two cases static and dynamic pressures. This ﬁgure shows that the saturation
in the case of dynamic capillary pressure is greater than the saturation in the case of static
capillary pressure. Moreover, comparison between static and dynamic capillary pressure are
plotted in Fig. 1 (right). Similarly, we may note that the dynamic capillary pressure is greater
than the static capillary pressure. These results are comparable to many experimental results
such as those in Fig. 5 in Ref. [12].

Conclusion

In the current work, we investigated the problem of two-phase ﬂow in porous media including
the dynamic capillary pressure has been studied. The IMPES scheme is considered to solving
the problem under consideration. The saturation equation is used in two diﬀerent locations
of the scheme. The ﬁrst location was when substituting the time derivative of the saturation
in the capillary pressure term in the pressure equation. In the second location, is the saturation equation which is explicitly with the upwinding advection to update the saturation. The
stability condition of the scheme has been determined. We conclude from this study that the
dynamic capillary pressure IMPES scheme is naturally stable.
