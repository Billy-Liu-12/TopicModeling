events can cascade and result in adverse outcomes for the patient. Fig. 1 shows the different
scales that can be impacted by adverse events. The figure must be read from the center to the
edge of the circle for the impacts on space scale and following the unit circle for the impacts on
time scale. We show, for example, that OR awareness delay of the order of minutes may affect
the global time scale with case cancellation. Similar results can be seen at the space scale when
missing instruments affect the whole OR suite workflow.

Figure 1: Symbolic representation of the multiscale distribution of surgical flow ranging from
the smallest scale, OR awareness, to the hospital system level involving hundreds of staff.

Current optimization techniques to schedule surgery [4, 5] have limited capability because
of uncertainty with regard to procedural time, lack of detailed information on the state of the
system and a large number of last minute emergency cases added to the schedule. Consequently,
continuous real-time rescheduling is done by the staff based on their expertise and one-toone communication with other staff members [13]. Common sources of frustration for OR
management include [15]:
• Turnover time between surgeries above the hospitals management policy [2].
• Delays in the start time of the first case of the day [6].
• Surgeries that run longer than anticipated and lead to cancellation of other cases [1].
Standard techniques commonly employed, such as check lists and team work protocols [11],
cannot maintain satisfactory performance in such a stressful and uncertain environment. We
propose that staff and patients would greatly benefit from a user-friendly, cyber-physical infrastructure [10] that constantly monitors events and uses a sophisticated model of surgical flow to
anticipate difficulties and efficiently assists rescheduling efforts of the OR team.
To establish the necessary infrastructure we first designed and tested an automated system
called ”smartOR” in the clinical environment, see figure 2. The system tracks the processes

Figure 2: Left: Symbolic representation of the OR suite lay out and traffic: a white board
is used to control all OR scheduling of the bloc in combination with the electronic patient
record from EPIC. Right: Low cost wireless sensors are used to acquire room state: a camera
detects the motion of the anesthesia ventilator, the door has an array of sensors including an
accelerometer to register entry/exit events, a simple IR sensor can detect an empty OR

within the OR in real time and automatically identifies and informs the OR team of the room
state [8]. To complement the smartOR we developed a BoardProbe, an electronic whiteboard
which supports organizational and collaborative activities within the surgical suite and emulates
the familiar dry-erase white board traditionally used the OR suite managment [12]. Combining SmartOR and BoardProbe efficiently delivers real-time information and alerts about OR
activity to the surgical staff [9] improving resource utilization and communication.
Nevertheless, root cause analysis of surgical flow inefficiencies in any given hospital and
identification of factors that need to be adjusted requires a rational analytical model.
Here, we propose a multiscale, agent-based, theorectical mathematical model that we successfully compared to the smartOR data and allows management to address problems and
inefficiencies.

Mathematical Modeling

We propose a staff-specific ABM intended to retain the key features we observed in daily clinical
practice. The proposed model specifically takes into account the contributions of each staff
member in the team necessary to advance the task. Some staff, for example the anesthesiologist
and the cleaning team,is assigned to several ORs and the model accounts for delays in awareness
of events and time to circulate around the OR suite. The theoretical framework has been kept
as general as possible to be able to apply it to any hospital system, and calibrate and adapt
the modular structure to the detail of clinical data specific to the hospital.
To summarize, the model computes the time evolution of two sets of unknowns:
• State of task k for agent i is denoted as vector Tki ,
• Trajectory and state of agent i denoted Si
We start here with a simplified graph showing the macro steps such preparation for anesthesia, access, surgerical procedure (open or minimally invasive), closing time, time to awake
the patient and OR exit - see figure 3. The system was deployed in five pluridisciplinary ORs
and provides accurate measurements of the duration of each of these steps [8].
We use six main categories of agents: A for surgeons, B for surgeons assistants, C for
anesthesiologists, R for Certified Registred Nurse Anesthesit (CRNA), D for scrub nurses, E

for cleaning crew. For simplicity, we assume that a surgical team, denoted S, in any given
OR consists of one agent in each category. Most importantly each agent is associated with a
level of technical skill and a level of communication skill. For example, a team of N surgeons
noted {A(j, n)} working in the ORs suite is represented by a N × 2 matrix of performance level.
The first index is the ID of the agent in the set {1 ... N }, the second is for the performance
type. n=1 corresponds to the technical performance and is denoted by pA
t ; n=2 is for the
communication performance index denoted pA
c . Initially, we set up individual technical skills
as a function of the number of years of experience in the current position, and communication
skills as a function of the time spent working with the current team, since frequency in team
composition change is negatively correlated to information sharing [3].
We use an estimate of the duration for each macro step, such as patient intubation, access
time, surgerical procedure itself, patient extubation, or time to move the patients out of the OR
- see figure 3. This estimate is a statistical distribution that depends on the patient s medical
conditions and reflects the ideal time that a perfect surgical team should achieve. As we will
see later on, our model is stochastic and accounts for delays due team members lack of timely
availability, poor coordination between tasks, or suboptimal performance of the surgical team.
For any given OR only one task can be in process at any given time,as reflected on the
flowchart - see figure 3. The progression T̃ of the task k for the agent i, noted Tki , from 0 to
1 is described by an ordinary differential equation with the right hand side depending on the
team skills. T̃ is set to 0 if the task is not completed, i.e. 0 ≤ Tki < 1, and 1 otherwise. M
is a sparse matrix that corresponds to the directed graph of Fig 3 . The master equation that
provides the time evolution of the state of the graph of tasks {Tki } handled by the team Si that
advances the task Tq at time step q is:
T̃ (tq+1 ) = [M × (T̃ (tq ))] ◦ [(G(tq − t0 ))Si .Ek ].

(1)

Here × denotes the sparse matrix vector product, and ◦ the vector product component-wise,
and . the product of a vector by a scalar.
This model has three components:
• M × (T̃ (tq )) where M is a sparse matrix that expresses the dependency on previous tasks.
• G(tq − t0 )Si reflects the time-dependent progression of the individual task.
• 0 ≤ Ek ≤ 1 is a positive factor representing a penalty for the environment conditions.
It may be the limitation resulting from shared equipment or specific overload of the hospital
system due to epidemic or crisis.
Conceptually we can represent the ABM computing kernel for each node of the flow graph
as in Figure 3.
The advancement of task provide by G(t) is not linear in time, i.e. Ġ = constant, but
instead depends on team performance and coordination. We conveniently use an ordinary set
of differential equations to integrate that progression in time:
Ġ = βFk (S)f (t) + Ho

(2)

The initial condition is zero, and β is a normalizing constant such that G reaches 1 at
completion of the task in the optimal configuration. Time integration starts only when all staff
required for that specific task are present in the OR. More precisely, we define the optimum
performance of a team as one that (i) has full awareness on the case, (ii) does not show any
sign of fatigue or stress, and (iii) has best technical and communication skills. We represent
mathematically each of these elements (i) to (iii) below.
In equation (2), 1 ≥ Fk (S) ≥ 0 stands for the team efficiency at the task Tk .

Figure 3: Illustration of our simplified flow chart on the left and its impact on the conceptual
Model of process advancement corresponding to each node of the flow chart

The team performance component of the surgeon and his assistant for a specific task of the
graph of nodes described at the high level is additive on technical skills, impacted by the worst
skill in communication on the team, factored by a function f(t) that takes into account fatigue,
as well as efficiency as a correlation of repetition of the same surgery. Overall performance
cannot go below a given threshold Ho corresponding to a minimum processing rate, since the
team has been granted surgical privileges. For simplicity we assume that the same surgical
team operates in the same OR the entire day. Nurse shift is modeled as a time penalty for
which the ODE integration is on hold.
We have applied these basic principles to the team performance description of each task in
figure 3 and used the following example in our simulations, with A for surgeons, B for surgeon s
assistants, C for anesthesiologists, R for CRNA, D for scrub nurses, E for cleaning crews:

our plan is to eventually retrieve these values from clinical data provided for example by the
black box system [14] that has the ability to report most of these parameters.

Results

Starting from the general model described above and, we simplified it according to the data
that we have collected in the clinic. Without an extensive electronic patient record input into
the model, we assume a normal distribution of patient conditions. Similarly, we will assume
a normal distribution of the individual team performances of staff to keep the probabilistic
nature of the model without adding additional complexity. The resulting model has 13 key
parameters describing the overall infrastructure, see Table 1. A nonlinear sensitivity has been
done utilizing a partial rank correlation method based on the exploration of the hypercube of
the parameter space. Table 1 provides this list of parameters and their impact on segments
of surgical flow time known for their value as efficiency indicators. The ranking in each row
increases starting from one for the most influential parameters, including only the parameters

Table 1: Ranking the Influence of the Parameters on key factors of OR efficiency, such as
anesthesia time, wake up time and turnover
that have significant impact.
Given parameters
• q1 is the maximum length of time it takes the patient to arrive from the pre-operative
area,
• q2 is the ideal length of time to put the patient under anesthesia.
• q3 is the shortest lenght of time achievable for minimally invasive surgery that would
correspond to the simplest case, and q4 the largest length of time that would correspond
to the most complex patient condition.
• q5 and q6 are equivalent time length estimates to q3 and q4, applied to open surgery.
• q7 is the ideal length of time for the patient to wake up from anesthesia.
• q8 is the ideal length of time to clean and disinfect the OR according to best practices.
• q9 is the ratio of anesthesiologists to the number of ORs.
• q10 is the ratio of janitorial teams to the number of ORs.
• q11 is the awareness and communication delay until a janitorial team arrives at the OR,
expressed in seconds per each OR in the surgical suite.
• q12 is the awareness delay for anesthesiologists to come to the OR expressed in seconds
per each OR in the surgical suite.
• q13 is the average recovery time in the post-operative area after surgery.
We ran our simulation over a period of one year for which we have clinical data, and use a
genetic algorithm to get the best fit. We present our data as a normalized histogram of time
distribution for anesthesia, surgical time for open and minimally invasive procedures, awaking
time and turnover time. The large pluridisciplanry suite we use for our analysis has roughly an
equal number of open and minimally invasive procedures. The curves in red in Figure 4 and
Figure 5 are for the clinical data and in black are the simulation result. In this process, we
retrieved the unknown parameters q1 to q13 as the solution of the best-fit optimization problem
and compare some of them with additional observations or knowledge of the organization of
the staff that has not been entered in the model.
The first conclusion is that the simulation cannot fit the clinical data if we zero parameters
characteristics of the multiscale nature of the model such as q9 to q13 . For example, instead
of a lognormal distribution of surgical time as it can be demonstrated by analyzing our data,
it would result in normal curves, and instead of a turnover time distribution with slow decay

Figure 4: Comparison of normalized distributions of cases with respect to elapse time for open
surgery, minimally invasive surgery, anesthesia and waking up time between observed (red dots)
and simuated (black line) data.

toward the worst performance we would achieve a normal distribution with a very narrow
standard deviation.
However, we observe a poor fitting of the open surgical time, and a slightly better result
for minimally invasive surgery. This result is not surprising since we treated the description of
surgery in a very coarse way in our model. Our data set includes very short surgeries such as
cholecystectomy or appendectomy as well as much longer one such as organ transplantation.
Obviously we need to refine our surgical flow chart by including more specific description of
surgery types and acquire estimates of parameter values similar to q3 to q6 for each class of
surgery.
The prediction of anesthesia time and wake up time seem accurate enough to be of practical
value, see figure 4. The prediction of turnover time on figure 5, one of the key targets for
improvement in OR suite management, is very good, especially considering the uncertainty of
the system and the fact that this is the most non-linear factor.
The validation of the multiscale model comes in part from the optimal value of the parameters we retrieved through in the fitting process. For example we found that q9 and q10 , the
delay of OR awareness for the cleaning team, is between 6 and 12 min while for anesthesiologist
it is between 2.5 and 5 min. This is in agreement with our observation during monitoring of the
white board activity over a period of a week [9], with the main reason for the delay being that
OR state changes are entered manually and communication is often depending on individual
cell phone conversation (call or text message).
The model also estimates that the optimal proportion of anesthesiologists q9 is 1 to 5, while
it is in reality about 1 to 4. Other results from this a posteriori analysis cannot be provided in
this short paper.
From the many lessons we learned from this study we retain three key elements of the
capability of multiscale modeling to test various hypotheses on OR management improvement:
• The OR performance is limited by the shortage of shared personal such as anesthesiologists
who circulate from one OR to another in order to assist the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthesists (CRNA). If this ratio was as large as 1/2, the model predicts a significant improvement
of performance.

• The overall OR system is very sensitive to OR awareness time, i.e. how much time it takes
for an anesthesiologist or the cleaning staff to realize that their presence is needed. This would
advocate in favor of installing a cyber-physical infrastructure including our BoardProbe design
[12] that shorten that critical communication time.
• The inability to free the OR because there is no bed available in the recovery area is
another important cause of suboptimal efficiency.
In our simulation, accumulation of delays resulting of these three factors can result in
turnover time about an hour; this seems to be congruent with our observation. However, a
solution that would increase the infrastructure size and staff support without reason would
increase health care costs and eventually impact the patient. We are confident that modeling
with a concept like ours should be sufficiently accurate to predict optimum ratio of resources that
would significantly improve the efficiency, improve the budget, and increase patient satisfaction.

Future Work

Our multiscale modeling of surgical flow of a large OR suite brings new light and rational to
improve organizational and infrastructure costs positively. There is additional effort needed to
gather accurate information on surgical time according to a pertinent classification of procedures, as well as to systematic use of the electronic patient record in order to condition those
estimates with patient comorbidities. As the health industry becomes closer and closer to other
industries standard such as civil aviation that has precise protocol and worldwide standards for
each procedure, it is only a matter of time that a multiscale model could be calibrated precisely.
However, there are still wide open questions on how surgical team performs and how we
can really quantify such organization as a function of individual skills. We found this topic
fascinating and intend to devote significant effort in future work to tackle that challenge.
