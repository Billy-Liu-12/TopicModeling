two types of global textual features, namely imitation features and bigram features in DomainWatcher. Imitation features reflect the distance between domains, while bigram features reflect
the similarity of the distribution of alphanumerics in domain names. DoaminWatcher is robust
as the adversary is hard to design countermeasures that can make the two global features fail
at the same time.
In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we propose DomainWatcher to
detect malicious domains based on local and global textual features. Second, we clearly define
two global features, and give the corresponding measure method to quantify imitation features
based on Levenshtein Distance and bigram features based on frequency. The last, we effectively
implement the DomainWatcher and conduct some experiments on real-world data

Related Work

Prior work on malicious domain detection can be summarized as approaches based on active
analyses and approaches based on passive analyses. Approaches based on active analyses generally include DNS detection, analyses of websites content and artificial judgment. Approaches
based on passive analysis usually contain three types, namely rule-based matching, machine
learning approaches and graph-based approaches.
Rule-based approaches detect malicious domains through matching domain with a prepared
domains list or some specific rules. This approaches have the advantage of the short time in
detection, according to the given knowledge. However, rule-based matching just detects known
malicious domains; it cannot detect unknown domains correctly. And the list or the rules may
need much cost to construct and maintain.
Machine learning approaches are the most popular approach for malicious domain detection.
L Bilge et al. proposed a passive DNS analysis with many characteristics, and used the J48
classifier to detect malicious domains with high accuracy [3]. M Antonakakis et al. also used
BGP, AS, Registration to be the features for building the reputation system for DNS [4]. J Ma
et al. utilized statistical learning techniques based on lexical features and host-based features
of inbound URLs, to determine whether the URL is malicious or not [5].
Graph-based approaches are proposed in recent years. PK Manadhata et al. extracted
domains IP and WHOIS information then used the graph algorithm of Belief Propagation (BP)
to detect malicious domains [6]. The similar study is also found in [7]. In addition, I Khalil et
al. exploited a path-based graph algorithm to establish the relationships between domains and
hosts, and inferred states of unknown domains [8].

Features of DomainWatcher

In this paper, we propose our approach named DomainWatcher with the classic process of
approaches based on machine learning. Before training and testing, we need to collect three
types of textual features of domains, lexical features, imitation features and bigram features,
respectively. Therefore, we illustrate details of the three features.

3.1

Lexical Features

In our work, we not only absorb the experience of prior work [3], [9], and select the common
characteristics, such as the length of a domain name(L1), whether the domain contains IP address(L2) and the number of dots(L3), but also extend some new characteristics in textual fea2

tures, including the number of special characters and numeric characters (L4, L5)the percentage
of special characters in domain length(L6), the number of continuous numeric characters(L7),
the maximum length between every adjacent dots(L8), the maximum length of continuous numeric characters(L9) and the maximum length of continuous letters(L10), in order to improve
its modest performance. Unlike other time-based characteristics and TTL Value-based characteristics of domains, this 10 kinds of lexical characteristics are the textual features of domains
itself, and can be easily fetched and normalized.

3.2

Imitation Features

The imitation features are defined to express the difference between test domains and the popular domain set in textual level, which takes both as a whole, globally judging the relationship
with Levenshtein Distance [10].
In our work, we calculate the imitation value of two domains in the transformation of the
Levenshtein Distance. Suppose there are two given strings s and t of length m and n respectively,
the Levenshtein Distance between s and t named Ds,t is in the range [0, max{m, n}]. Now we
define the imitation function Is,t for calculating imitation value, shown in Equation 1.
Is,t =

1
1 + Ds,t

(1)

In practice, we employ domains in popular domain set to calculate a given domain’s imitation
features for more correctly quantifying domains imitation. Suppose that there are an unknown
domain t and a popular domain set C = {di |1 ≤ i ≤ β}, for each domain di in C, we can
calculate an imitation value It,di , then, combine all imitation values into a β-dimension vector
It . Parameter β represents β domains selected for the popular domain set.
In this paper, we construct popular domain sets by two different methods. One is to sequentially select domains on authoritative websites to compose a popular domain set. The other is
to use the kmeans clustering algorithm to divide the data set into several clusters and choose
the center domain of each cluster to make up the popular domain set.

3.3

Bigram Features

Inspired by the use of bigrams in [10], [11], [12], we choose the domains bigrams (two consecutive
characters) to extend the textual features for bigram features.
For given an unknown domain t, it has a bigram set At including the bigrams of the domain
itself. For given a popular domain set C, it also has a bigram set A including the bigrams of
all domains. In terms of the set At , different domain has different numbers of bigrams. For
the sake of normalization, we select the top − γ bigrams of the highest frequency into a bigram
vector Bt . Especially, we use the frequency in the set A instead of that in the set At , to express
the potential relationship between the test domain and the popular domain set. To elaborate,
we first calculate frequencies F 0i of bigrams in set A and frequencies Fj of bigrams in set At .
Then we select the top − γ bigrams in set At , and use their frequencies in set A to replace the
primary frequencies in set At . If the bigram is not in set A, the corresponding frequency is zero.
At last, we contrast the bigram features into a γ-dimension vector Bt . Parameter γ represents
γ bigrams selected from the bigram set of a domain.

Experimental Results
Experimental Setup

In our work, we mainly constructed one dataset, namely C7000. It contains 2000 malicious
domains and 5000 legitimate domains, collected from PhishTank, DNS-BH and Alexa. What is
worth mentioning, the construction of imitation and bigram features relies on a popular domain
list. We get 10000 domains from the top sites of Alexa, namely C10000.
As a binary classification problem, the detection may produce four types of results. In our
work, we regard malicious domains as positive samples, so when the classifier correctly predicts
a malicious domain, it is a true positive (TP). Otherwise, it is a false positive (FP). And when
the classifier correctly predicts a legitimate domain, it is a true negative (TN). Otherwise, it is
a false negative (FN). Therefore, we evaluate the results of 10-fold cross validation with three
P
TP
2·P ·R
metrics: precision rate(P = T PT+F
P ), recall rate(R = T P +F N ) and F1 -measure(F1 = P +R ).

4.2

Effects of DomainWatcher

We use six methods to detect malicious domains with the different combinations of the three
textual features: (a) only use lexical features, abbreviated L; (b) only use imitation features, but
orderly fetch the top-β domains from C10000, abbreviated TI; (c) only use imitation features,
but use the k-means clustering algorithm to divide C10000 to β clusters, abbreviated KI; (d)
Only use bigram features, abbreviated B; (e) L, TI and B are used together, abbreviated
L+TI+B; (f) L, KI and B are used together, abbreviated L+KI+B.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the change of the F1 -measure of methods TI, KI and B with
different parameters β and γ. As shown in figures, we can get high F1 -measure when β=50 for
the both methods TI and KI, as well as when γ=7 for method B. In the next work, we select
these values to be the size of the popular domain set and the dimension of bigram features.
The left of Table 1 shows the details of four methods with the dataset C7000. We can explicitly see that method L+KI+B has the best performance. For proving the good performance
of DomainWatcher, we additionally do an experiment to contrast our textual-based approaches
to a network-based approach, and results shown in the right of the table. C1600 is a subset
of C7000 and domains have out-of-band information (i.e., TTL, NS ). It is obvious that our
textual based approaches with lightweight characteristics perform better than network-based
approach with complicated characteristics.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel method named DomainWatcher based on local and global
textual features of domains to discriminate malicious domains from legitimate domains. Experimental results show that DomainWatcher is lightweight and easy to have a better efficiency
compared with the previous work.
