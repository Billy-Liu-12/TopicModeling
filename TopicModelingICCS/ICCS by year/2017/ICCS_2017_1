In the paper Rank miRNA: a web tool for identifying polymorphisms altering miRNA target
sites, Beretta et al provided a web application, called Rank miRNA for the aggregation of results
of three known prediction tools, and to process and analyze new input miRNA sequences
In the paper Higher accuracy protein multiple sequence alignments by genetic algorithm,
Behera et al. considered the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The paper provided
a new MSA method based on a stochastic approach, using evolutionary operators of a genetic
algorithm to combine the results of two known sequence alignment tools.
In the paper Machine learning models in error and variant detection in high-variation highthroughput sequencing datasets, Krachunov et al. presented machine learning models to classify
erroneous and rare variations. Moreover, a preselection phase is performed, selecting potential
error candidates with a weighted frequency measure.
In the paper Effect of Variations in Gap Junctional Coupling on the Frequency of Oscillatory
Action Potentials, Appukuttan et al. investigated the computational effects of differences in
gap junctional properties on oscillating action potentials in electrically coupled tissues.
The second session Medical Informatics Applications and Tools comprised six full papers
about medical application of informatics. In the first paper Using Multi Network Alignment
for Analysis of Connectomes, Milano et al. considered the modeling of MRI connectomics with
networks and applied multiple network alignment approaches to compare different networks.
In the second paper Investigation of the visual attention role in clinical bioethics decisionmaking using machine learning algorithms, Fernandes et al. proposed a machine learning approach to build predictive models using eye tracking data. The goal of the method is to provide
results to support decision-making process in clinical bioethics, in particular in cases of euthanasia.
In the paper Emotion recognition using facial expressions, Tarnowski et al. considered the
problem of recognizing emotional states by means of facial expressions. The proposed method
relies on coefficients describing elements of facial expressions, based on six registered subjects,
that were used as features.
In the paper Accelerating the Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Biomarker in the clinical practice:
Comparative study, Borreguero Torro et al. presented implementations based on multicore
(OpenMP) and GPU (CUDA) to speed up Diffusion Weighted Image (DWI) methods for the
extraction of meaningful information about the microscopic motions of water of human tissues
from MRI.
In the paper Combining Grid Computing and Docker Containers for the Study and Parametrization of CT Image Reconstruction Methods, Chillarn et al. studied the optimization of
configurations and parameters on containers within a grid computing platform, in the context
of computed tomography image reconstruction.
In the paper Vocal signal analysis in patients affected by Multiple Sclerosis, Vizza et al.
presented a study of voice analysis for patients affected by Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The goal of
the study is a better understanding of the disease: early detection, differential diagnosis, and
monitoring.
These workshop proceedings include the final revised versions of the BBC papers, taking
the feedback from reviewers and workshop audience into account. The program chairs sincerely
thank the Program Committee members for the time and expertise they put into the reviewing
work, the ICCS organization, for providing the opportunity to arrange the BBC workshop in
conjunction with the ICCS 2017 conference, and all the workshop attendees.
