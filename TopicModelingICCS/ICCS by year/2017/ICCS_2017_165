dimensional data point is mapped to a point P in a two-dimensional SC Space, and this is achieved by
adding up the vectors from respective axes.
As can be seen, vector additions within the SC space must be valid, in order to project all the data
points correctly on an SC Plot. However, we have identified two design flaws in SC Plot that violate
such a requirement. This degrades the technical soundness of SC approach for data visualizations.
In Cartesian Coordinate system, every axis is a number line with positive and negative numbers, and
with the number 0 at the origin. However, in SC Plot, every dimension is represented by an axis scaled
to a range of [0, 1]. This is because all data elements of a vector, including negative values, are
transformed to a range of [0, 1] using min-max normalization. This means that any addition of
transformed vectors within the SC space is not valid. This is the first design flaw of SC Plot.
The second design flaw is concerned with its placement of (statistically) independent dimensions in
exact opposite axes (e.g., refer to dimensions A2 and A4 in Figure 1(a)). This placement has the implicit
meaning that one dimension (e.g., A2) is the exact opposite of the other (e.g., A4), which is semantically
incorrect because two independent attributes must not directly cancel the effect of one another.
Due to the above-mentioned flaws, vector additions can no longer be meaningfully applied within
the SC space. This results in certain types of n-dimensional data points being projected to the origin in
the SC space. We call such data points blind spots because they cannot be observed in the SC space. In
particular, blind spots are data points with one of the following characteristics: (i) all the normalized
component values of a data vector are identical; or (ii) each pair of normalized component values (from
any two dimensions in exact opposite position within SC Space) of a data vector are identical. The
mathematical proofs of such blind spots will be presented in a future publication.
To address the above-mentioned issues, we first introduce a sign-preserving data normalization
technique that scales each attribute to a guaranteed bound of [-1, 1]. We then include a negative region
on the plot, which allows a more meaningful display of negative vectors, and at the same time get rid of
issues related to placing independent axes in exact opposite directions. The rest of this paper is
organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed method. Section 3 presents experimental setup
and results. Section 4 discusses related work and concludes this paper.

2 Enhanced Star Coordinate
To address the issues identified earlier, we introduce a new data normalization method that keeps
the original data sign in each corresponding transformed value, and at the same time bounds the range
of each transformed axis. Let V be an n-dimensional data point. In dimension i, an original data element
vi can be normalized using: vi* = vi/mi, where mi = max(|mini|, |maxi|), and mini and maxi are the minimum
and maximum values in dimension i, respectively. Here, vi* exhibits two properties. Firstly, the sign of
vi* is the same as the sign of vi because mi > 0. This property allows the locality of data points to be
presented more meaningfully in the visualization output. Hence, a data set that contains only positive
(or negative) values will only be mapped to the positive (or negative) region of the visualization output.
Secondly, the normalized values are guaranteed in the bound of [-1, 1], which occurs when |mini| =
|maxi|, mini < 0, and maxi > 0. This property allows each dimension to be treated equally to avoid
distorting the actual patterns to be displayed on the graphical output.
To allow positive and negative regions in each axis, and to avoid placing independent axes in exact
opposite directions, we introduce the Enhanced Star Coordinates, which has axes A1, A2, …, An for an
n-dimensional data space D. Let there be an imaginary horizontal reference line R with an arbitrary point
as the center (i.e., origin). All the axes here are number lines crossing the origin. Any axis Ai inclines at
π/n(i - ½) with R. This results in adjacent axes that are equally spaced by π/n. In addition, R separates
the positive and negative regions, which are above and below R, respectively.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the Original Star Coordinate (OSC) plot and the proposed Enhanced Star
Coordinate (ESC) plot respectively. There are two key differences between OSC and ESC. Firstly, every
axis of ESC spans from the negative to the positive regions and cuts across the origin, whereas OSC has
positive axes only. Secondly, the angular distance (w.r.t. the origin) between any adjacent pair of axes
in ESC is π/n, while that of OSC is 2π/n. Apart from these differences, the basic vector addition operation
for deriving a projected vector remains unchanged.

Enhanced Star Coordinate System (ESC). Both show a four-dimensional data space representation.

3 Experimental Setup and Results
In this section, we evaluate the visualization results generated using OSC and ESC. Table 1 gives a
summary of five datasets used for evaluating the methods; and each dataset contains a few clusters that
are spatially separated in multi-dimensional data space.

Intuitively, we expect a good visualization method to display the clusters according to how distinct
they are in the original data space. For output evaluations, we first inspect the outputs visually; we then
use an objective measure to evaluate how well the methods preserve topological distances among data
points in the original data space D. To do so, we define the following. Let d(D) be a set of pairwise
distances of some data pairs in D. Let d(S) be the set of the pairwise distances of the corresponding data
pairs in the projected space S. The preservation of topological distances can be evaluated using
correlation, ρ(d(D),d(S)) = cov(d(D),d(S))/(σd(D) σd(S)), where cov(∙,∙) is the covariance, and σ the
standard deviation. Here, ρ that is close to 1 (or 0) means the topological distances are well (or not well)
preserved from D to S.

Results: The visualization outputs generated from the WISCONSIN, MULCROSS, and
SYNTHETIC datasets are shown in Figures 2(a), (b) and (c) respectively. It is evident that ESC is better
in discerning the spatially separated clusters more distinctly than OSC. This is also consistent with the
high correlation scores found between the pairwise distances of corresponding data points in D and S
attained by ESC, as compared with OSC.
The visual outputs of ECS and OSC (not shown here due to space constraints) are similar for the
IRIS and CLOUD datasets. However, ECS still achieves better correlation scores of 0.92 and 0.71 for
IRIS and CLOUD respectively; and these scores are higher than the scores of 0.81 and 0.64 attained by
OSC, for IRIS and CLOUD respectively.

Figure 2: Visualization outputs of OSC and ESC on three datasets: (a) WISCONSIN, (b) MULCROSS,
(c) SYNTHETIC. The preservation of topological distances evaluated using correlation, ρ(d(D),d(S)), shows
that ESC is better in preserving distances among data points in all datasets.

4 Related Work and Concluding Remarks
Since its introduction in early 2000, the star coordinate method has inspired a number of applications
in visualizations, extensions as well as refinements. An interesting application of star coordinates is the
VISTA system (Chen & Liu, 2004), where users could use the visualization output to confirm the
validity of purported cluster structures. The original Star Coordinate Plot is designed to display multidimensional data in a two-dimensional visualization space. A natural extension is to stretch the
visualization space to three dimensions (Cooprider & Burton, 2007). This expands the data exploration
space and help uncover subtle patterns that are otherwise hidden in a two-dimensional exploration space.
RadViz (Hoffman, Grinstein, Marx, & Grosse, 1997) and its extensions (Nováková & Stepánková,
2011) are methods which map multidimensional data points to a two-dimensional space. In RadViz,
each attribute is akin to a spring connected between the centre origin and a point located at the edge of
a circular disk. Each dimension is scaled to a range of [0, 1], and the value of a data element in a
dimension represents a spring force. In a multi-dimensional setting, the location of a data vector on the
RadViz plot represents the spring equilibrium state of the multidimensional data point. Although RadViz
is inspired from an idea different from that of the Star Coordinates, the two methods are indeed alike.
Hence, we believe that RadViz also suffers from similar weakness as Star Coordinates highlighted
earlier in this paper.
Concluding Remarks: This paper has presented the fundamental flaws in the original star
coordinates method. The two flaws, namely the non-preservation of original data signs, and the exact
opposite placement of independent axes, challenge the technical soundness of the existing methods and
applications based on the star coordinate concept. The Enhanced Star Coordinate Plot presented in this
paper has addressed these fundamental flaws. The experimental results also show that Enhanced Star
Coordinate performs better than the original star coordinates on all datasets. One immediate work in the
near future is to provide more theoretical analyses of ESC so as to prove that it is indeed a better method.
