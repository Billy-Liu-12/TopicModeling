Markovitz’s framework is presented from two perspectives. Given a portfolio’s expected
variance σp , find the maximum return µp ; on the other hand, given a portfolio’s expected
return µp , find the minimum variance σp . The two approaches are consistent. The optimization
problem is built assuming a portfolio consisting of n risky stocks, and positive definite VCV
matrix σ, where VCV is a Variance-Covariance matrix. The objective is to find a weight vector
w that minimizes portfolio’s total variance. This approach is known as the mean-variance
optimization (MVO).
Hence, Markovitz’s portfolio optimization find a global minimum for the following objective
function:
f (w) = V (w, σ) = w σw

(1)

subject to the general constraint, portfolio weights must sum up to one.
This model is commonly associated with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) developed by William Sharpe [14]. This fact partially explained why Harry Markowitz shared the
Nobel Prize in 1990 with Sharpe. However, the two models are used for different purposes by
financial practitioners.
CAPM theory considers Markowitz’s model from a microeconomics perspective to discover
price formation of financial assets. In this model, the central concept is that market portfolio
is uniquely defined. In Markowitz’s model, portfolio optimization depends on expected or
preferred returns and risks. Furthermore, the optimal portfolio is not unique and depends on
investor’s risk aversion. As a consequence, these two models could give two different approaches
to the asset allocation problem. While the CAPM theory is the principal pillar for passive
management, Markowitz’s model is the central technique to start actively managing a portfolio
if a practitioner believes that the information set is not unique or homogeneously spread across
market participants.

Analytically, let us consider a universe of n risky assets. Let µ = E[R] and
= E[(R −
µ)(R−µ)T ] be the vector of expected returns and the asset’s return covariance matrix. Classical
M V O assumes that a portfolio
with weights w = (w1 , w2 , ..., wn )T of n risky assets is fully

invested, meaning that i=1 wi = 1, hence, short sells are not allowed, i.e. w > 0. When we

have n stock prices time series: Sij at time j for security i, the log returns are Rij = ln Sij−1
,
then is possible
n to denote R = (R1 , · · · , Rn ) the asset returns vector. Portfolio’s return is equal
to R(w) = i=1 wi Ri . In a matrix form, it is obtained R(w) = wT R, portfolio’s expected
return is:
(2)
µ(w) = E[R(w)] = E[wT R] = wT E[R] = wT µ
While its variance is equal to:
σ 2 (w) =E[(R(w) − µ(w))(R(w) − µ(w))T ]
=E[wT R − wT µ)(wT R − wT µ)T ]

Clustering analysis is a successful tool to partition large data sets into groups based on its
features. This technique is commonly found in pattern discovery, classification and anomaly
detection. In portfolio optimization, clustering analysis could also be a successful technique
helping to select better portfolios based on unsupervised learning to preprocess asset selection.
In recent years, clustering analysis has arisen as one of the most innovative methods in portfolio
selection, as a multivariate statistical analysis method that reorganizes objects in a data set
into homogeneous groups [1]. Clustering analysis is frequently used for grouping data objects
in similar groups according to their similarities.
In this study, we tested several algorithms, which can be disaggregated into two main
groups: partitional and hierarchical clustering [15]. Dataset object division into non-overlapping
clusters is considered partitional clustering, whereas the presence of nested clusters organized
as subclusters in a tree map is called a hierarchical clustering. The later is commonly displayed
graphically using a diagram known as a dendrogram [15].
This work applies a set of correlation-based clustering algorithms, assuming that correlation
coefficient between two time series is a measure of their similarity. Correlation-based clustering
has been recently used to infer hierarchical structures among different asset classes from its
correlation coefficient matrix [9] [4] [3]. It is important to mention that in high volatility
periods the correlation as a measure of similarity does not hold up.
Exploring a new approach for asset allocation [8], López de Prado introduced a portfolio
diversification technique called “Hierarchical Risk Parity” (HRP), which uses graph theory
and hierarchical clustering. One of the main advantages of HRP is the possibility to compute a
portfolio on an ill-degenerated or even a singular covariance matrix, with a lower computational
cost. He adverted that the covariance matrix lacks the notion of hierarchy, which allows weights
to vary freely in random ways. Furthermore, he provided a good example that illustrates the
hierarchy concept for the asset allocation task: “...stocks could be grouped in terms of liquidity,

size, industry and location, where stocks within a given group compete for allocations. In
deciding the allocation to a large publicly-traded U.S. financial stock like J.P. Morgan, we
will consider adding or reducing the allocation to another large publicly-traded U.S. bank like
Goldman Sachs, rather than a small community bank in Switzerland, or a real estate holding
in the Caribbean”. This fact means that a correlation matrix makes no difference between the
hierarchy of assets classes.
This paper aims at placing stocks into groups, or clusters, suggested by the raw data, not
defined a priori, such that stocks in a given cluster tend to be similar to each other and stocks
in different clusters tend to be dissimilar. In terms of financial theory, this purpose allows
building highly diversified portfolios. In the following stage, this work proposes a risk-adjusted
optimization using Sharpe Ratio for optimal asset allocation into each cluster.
The next section will present a short review on selected clustering algorithms used to build
the risk diversified portfolio. Third section will explain the selected dataset and main topics
of the computational experiments. The fourth explain with detail the risk-adjusted portfolio performance measure [6] [7]. Fifth section will show results focusing on the performance
measures of portfolio selection based on each clustering algorithm using Markovitz optimized
portfolios as benchmarks. Finally, conclusions and further research opportunities are presented.

Clustering Algorithms

We tested the potential of clustering in portfolio selection using different clustering algorithms.
First Algorithm used is K-Means. This method [2], initializes cluster centers by selecting points
within the dataset that are further away from each other in a probabilistic manner. This algorithm widely used in several applications because it is by far the one with the highest simplicity
improving the speed of convergence. Mini Batch K-Means [13] is a K-Means variant, which
uses mini-batches or subsets of input data to reduce computation time, while still attempting
to optimize the same objective function, thereby converging faster than K-Means. However,
the quality of the results is reduced. The Spectral clustering algorithm is especially efficient
if the affinity matrix is sparse and it is used as a similarity metric for distance in a graph i.e.
nearest-neighbor graph [11].
The Birch algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between points as a similarity metric,
for a given data it builds a tree known as a Characteristic Feature Tree (CFT). It has two
parameters, branching factor and threshold. Specifically, the branching factor limits the number
of subclusters in a node and the threshold limits the distances between points. The approach
of this algorithm is related to data reduction methods, given that it reduces the input data to
a set of subclusters. One of its principal disadvantages is the scalability to high dimensional
data [18]. This drawback could be a problem with huge financial datasets.
If hierarchical clustering is going to be applied to portfolio optimization, it is required a
convenient distance metric such[9]:

Di,j = 2(1 − ρi,j )
(4)

where Di,j is the distance metric based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, ρi,j , between
the ith and the j th asset.
This work tests also three categories of hierarchical clustering, specifically the three principal agglomerative clustering algorithms Average Linkage (AL), Complete Linkage (CL) and
Ward’s Method (WM). Each one of them is based on a linkage criteria to determine the metric

used for the merge strategy. Agglomerative clustering uses a bottom-up approach to perform
hierarchical clustering when each observation starts in its own cluster, and clusters are successively merged together. The AL algorithm minimizes the average of the distances between
all observations of pairs of clusters and has been related to a version of spanning tree called
Average Linkage Minimum Tree [16]. The Other algorithms covered, CL, minimizes the maximum distance between observations of pairs of clusters and finally, WM minimizes the sum of
squared differences within all clusters. Although the CL and WM algorithms are not associated
with spanning tree graphs, they could deliver remarkable results.

Data description and Experiment

All stock information used in this paper come from the Rusell 1,000
Index constituents,
figure 2 shows the exposition by industrial sector of the stocks selected. The Rusell 1,000
stocks represent over 90% of the total market capitalization of all U.S. listed stocks, and it
is considered a bellwether index for large-cap investing. This work uses closing prices for the
175 assets with the highest participation in the index from 12/09/2016 to 9/11/2016 using a
R
1-minute resolution. These 175 assets represent the 64.16% of the Rusell 1,000

representing 71% of the total US equity market capitalization. The first graph in figure 3 shows
the return correlation matrix before and after clustering for the 175 assets selected, clustering
algorithms are executed using the data for first three weeks in a sliding window using a 1minute return correlation matrix as an in-sample data. Afterward, we distribute assets inside
each cluster relying on a Sharpe Ratio optimization [14]. During the next week, we keep the
allocation fixed and then estimate the in-cluster distribution every one, two and four hours.
This means that the clustering algorithms are executed each week with the data comprised of

the past three weeks in a sliding window and the asset allocation is reconfigured with mentioned
periodicities into each cluster by Sharpe ratio optimization.
This paper selected the optimal number of clusters when needed, using the CalinskiHarabaz(CH) score [5]. All non-hierarchical clustering technique needed an apriori definition
of the number of clusters used. The Calinski-Harabaz score is the ratio of means between
cluster dispersion and the dispersion inside every cluster. A higher value of this index shows
dense, well-separated clusters. The performance of each clustering algorithm is influenced by
the number of clusters formed. We found that the best selection based on the CH score was
ten clusters for all algorithms as is shown in figure 4. In addition, this work also presents the
Silhouette coefficient(SC) [12]. The SC score is bounded between -1 for incorrect clustering and
+1 for highly dense clustering. Scores around zero indicate overlapping clusters, the score is
higher when clusters are dense and well separated. Figure 5 shows that hierarchical clustering
algorithms tend to have the best cluster configuration based on the SC. It is important to highlight that these algorithms generate autonomously the optimal number of clusters for grouping
the data.
Fifth section will show trading performances of the seven selected portfolio strategies using
clustering techniques and Markovitz optimization inside clusters.

Portfolio Performance Measure

One of the most important measures to evaluate the performance of a financial asset is Omega
ratio [6] [7], a relative measure of the probability of reaching a certain return, such as a minimum
target. A high Omega value indicates a high probability that a minimum target return will
be met or exceeded. The value of the Omega function at r, a threshold level, is the ratio of
positive returns relative to r weighted by their probability and negative returns relative to r
also weighted by their probability. If F (x) is the cumulative density function of returns then:
 ∞
(1 − F (x))dx
Ω(r) = r  r
.
(5)
F (x)dx
−∞

The omega concept divides the expected return into two parts, gains and losses, or returns
above the threshold level and those below it. Therefore, in simple terms, consider omega as
the ratio of positive returns relative to negative returns. The Omega Ratio is a measure of
performance that doesn’t assume a normal distribution of returns and contains much more
information about the return distribution, including the mean, variance, skew and kurtosis and
is especially valuable for non-normal investment returns. It actually uses the real return distribution rather than a theoretical normal distribution.
The Omega ratio also considers all information available from return’s history of a given
asset, it can be used to rank potential investments addressing the investor’s threshold level.
However, the Omega based decisions are not static for at least two reasons: As return information is updated, the probability distribution will change and omega must be updated. As
the asset manager’s threshold level changes, the rankings among comparative investments may
change. Therefore, the omega ratio allows asset managers to visualize the trade-off between
risk and return at different threshold levels for various asset choices.

Results

Figure 6 shows that the best clustering technique is the Ward Method (WM), a subclass of
hierarchical clustering techniques when portfolio performance is measured using the Omega
Ratio. This model reached a positive return during the out-sample dataset when clusters were
rebalanced every hour during the 160 transactions or portfolio rebalances. Figure 6 also shows

that portfolios created using all the clustering techniques have better Omega ratios than the
MVO portfolio. At threshold level 0%, WM shows the best Omega ratio of all models implying
the best balance between return and risk. Rebalancing the portfolio every two hours, the
MVO portfolio obtained the best result in terms of accumulated returns. The Omega ratio is
higher for the MVO algorithm using a rebalancing period of two hours at a threshold level of
0%. However, figure 7 shows the instability in the portfolio returns generated using the MVO
algorithm. The volatility of the MVO portfolio returns reaches the highest spread between
minimum and maximum cumulative returns during the testing period. In contrast, clustering
algorithms have a remarkable stability where WM and all hierarchical clustering algorithms
show the lowest return volatility.
Figure 8 shows that the CL algorithm obtains the best accumulated returns in a rebalancing
period of four hours. Similarly, it presents the best Omega ratio at a threshold level of 0%. This
fact confirms the good behavior of hierarchical clustering algorithms in the portfolio selection
task. The results indicate the benefits of using clustering algorithms in asset allocation. This
results are in agreement with [8] and [17]. Following previous results, the clearest advantage
of using hierarchical clustering algorithms to solve the asset allocation problem is to achieve a
more stable diversified portfolio that shows a lower risk measured in terms of return volatility.
Figure 9 shows that the benchmark algorithm for portfolio construction, MVO, has the worst
volatility by far disregarding the rebalancing timing.

Concluding remarks and further research

Machine learning methods have recently been used in finance because they have a special
advantage when learning from data and adapting to financial market changes. Clustering
algorithms as a machine learning method allow practitioners to identify and incorporate fast
changes inherent to the dynamics of financial markets.
The MVO algorithm treats all variables as interrelated, assuming a complete cluster. In
other words, traditional asset allocation does not recognize the complexity immerse in the
data. This work presents some novel, robust and flexible methods with visual interpretations
to construct risk-adjusted portfolios. One of the main purposes of the study was testing the
adequate timing for rebalancing a portfolio, the findings suggest that a small holding period,
around one hour, shows the best financial performance. As a consequence, an adequate timing
for portfolio rebalancing is important to incorporate all changes and new information presented
in the market data. Clustering methods showed a better trade-off between return and risk
than MVO algorithm. The empirical results indicate that hierarchical algorithms have a better
performance when building diversified portfolios measured by the Omega ratio. One of the
most important results is the stable behavior of clustering-based portfolios addressing a special
issue in financial markets, the volatility.
The complexity of the decisions in portfolio selection leads us to propose a further research

with larger data sets, optimizing within clusters by the Omega ratio instead of the Sharpe Ratio,
exploring different distance measures such the Chebychev, Manhattan or Minkowski distances.
We could also incorporate investor’s preferences using fuzzy decision theory included in Fuzzy
Clustering applied to portfolio selection.
