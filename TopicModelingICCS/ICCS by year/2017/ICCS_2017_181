the highest glass forming ability (GFA)[5], though other studies suggest near but off-eutectic
compositions may have the highest GFA [6].
In this study, we conduct Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations with the SMA potential of
the eutectic NaK alloy across a wide range of temperatures. The isobaric-isothermal ensemble
NPT (constant number of atoms, pressure, and temperature) simulations are used to survey
and explore the configuration space of the system. The resulting thermodynamic properties
(density, enthalpy) are analyzed and followed along an annealing procedure that brings the
system from high temperatures to low temperatures. Additional structure identification, pair
correlation functions, and order parameters are used to analyze the sequence of characteristic
equilibrium states corresponding to the liquid phase and the two well defined solid phases that
develop at temperature below the melting temperature.

Model and Methods

The Second Moment Approximation (SMA) model potential is a many-body potential that
approximates the local environment of every atom. The SMA is a classical representation of
the tight binding approach. The model potential is a sum of terms that mimic the distribution
of electronic states in a d-band, Uel , supplemented with a repulsive Born-Mayer potential to
account for the repulsion between electrons at short range, Urep . Thus, the SMA analytical
expression is a sum of two terms Ucoh = Uel + Urep with
Urep =

where rij are the interatomic distances and N is the total number of atoms. The parameters
ζ0 , ε0 , p, q, r0 , for pure potassium and sodium were reported in [1] and shown in Table 1. For the
heteroatomic interactions, it has been shown that a variety of combination rules did not result
in substantial differences in the structure of the system [3]. We select the geometric mean of the
homoatomic values of Na and K interactions for the four
√ parameters between sodium and potassium atoms ζ0 , ε0 , p, q such that parameterN aK = parameterN a ∗ parameterK . Meanwhile,
the parameter r0 for the K-Na pairs affects the density of the final system. Therefore, both
Lorentz combination rules, arithmetic mean and geometric mean, were considered in several
simulations of the system in the liquid state. The most appropriate combination rule for the
heteroatomic parameter r0 was found to be a weighted arithmetic average where the weights are
the relative atomic ratios. Thus, r0N aK = NNN a r0N a + NNK r0K , where NK , NN a are the number
of potassium and sodium atoms, respectively. This combination rule for r0 provided an equilibrium density for the simulated NaK eutectic alloy in close agreement with the experimental
value [2]. Table 1 lists the heteroatom parameters used in this work.
Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) is an algorithm that allows to simulate system properties in thermodynamic equilibrium by generating a series of system states consistent with the

where Pi are the probabilities of finding the system in state i with energy Ei at temperature
T and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The denominator in Eq. 3 is the partition function of
the system that acts as a normalization factor. In the MMC algorithm each sampled state
is a system’s configuration given by the coordinates of all atoms composing the system. The
generated sequence of samples are linked through a Markov chain that requires ratios of probabilities between two consecutive samples as transition links between chain elements. This
eliminates calculation of the denominator in Eq. 3. The acceptance/rejection choice for transitioning from state i to state j is given by min(1, Pj /Pi ) and the principle of detailed balance
(transition probabilities i → j = j → i) [7].
Computer simulations were run for a system of 2000 atoms with periodic boundary conditions to simulate a bulk material with a cutoff radius of 45 Bohr. At the eutectic concentration
of the alloy the computational box has 648 sodium atoms and 1352 potassium atoms. The
SMA model potential is used to compute the potential energy of the atomic configurations.
The MMC is started from a configuration where the sodium atoms are randomly distributed in
the sites of a perfect bcc lattice. The remaining sites are populated with potassium atoms. A
new system configuration is generated by moving a single atom a random distance and direction.
The magnitude of this atomic movement is dynamically adjusted throughout the simulation to
maintain a 50 % rejection rate of attempted atomic moves.
The NPT version of the MMC was run where N, T and pressure are kept constant such that
the probability of the system transitioning from state i to state j is given by

(4)
where Vj , Vi are the volumes of the j, i states, respectively. In the simulations the volume change
of the computational box was attempted once 2000 atoms had attempted a move at constant
volume.
Typically, in order to obtain the average values reported in the next section, two million
passages through the full 2000 atoms were attempted after the system was sought to be in
equilibrium.

Results and Analysis

Initially, the system was equilibrated at a high temperature of about 700 K. At these temperatures the system is a hot liquid. Next the system was slowly cooled down by taking the last
configuration of the higher temperature to be the starting configuration at the lower temperature. The equilibrium density obtained at 350 K is 0.89 g/cm2 , which compares well with the
experimental value of 0.85 g/cm2 [2]. It is not surprising that the density from the simulation
is slightly higher than the experimental value since the optimal lattice constant of the pure
metals was less than the experimental [1].

During the cooling process and close to the melting temperature, the cooling rate was
accelerated to avoid crystal formation and allow formation of an amorphous branch and a
crystalline branch. In addition, once several points were obtained for the crystalline branch at
lower temperatures of about 160 K, these configurations were slowly and gradually warmed up
to produce crystalline configurations at higher temperatures. With this gradual warming, 239
K was the highest temperature at which the system remained crystalline for 2,000,000 MMC
steps. However, averages between 241 K and 260 K have some configurations that correspond
to the crystalline system. This is expected, since during a phase transition the system oscillates
between two phases. Figure 1 shows results for the average density and enthalpy per atom at

over those new runs. The gK−K (r) are shown in Fig.2 left. A clear difference between the

crystalline and amorphous systems is seen in the 2nd through 4rd peaks and in the general loss
of structure with increasing r in the amorphous compared to the crystalline solids. The peaks
in the crystalline solid match well with the bcc lattice. The definition of the crystal peaks is not
full because the potassium atoms occupy only 68% of the sample volume. The remaindering
sample volume is occupied by one cluster containing most of the sodium atoms. Sodium atoms
in this cluster are also organized in an incipient bcc structure as shown by the gN a−N a (r) in
Fig. 2 right. However, the Na cluster is extended, as desiring to form a lamellar structure,
and thus presenting a large surface area with expected lattice reconstruction. By contrast, the
amorphous system at this low temperature contains three Na clusters and a significantly larger
number of isolated Na atoms. The structure within the Na clusters of the amorphous solid is
also amorphous.
Figure 3 is a view of configurations at 120 K of the two solid systems pictorially showing
differences between them. The amorphous branch cannot be identified as a glass because there
has been formation of clusters of the minority atomic component instead of having a fairly
homogeneous distribution of sodium atoms across the sample.
A useful structural order parameter is the ratio of the peak height between the first peak and
subsequent peaks [7]. Shown in Fig. 4 are these ratios for the two solid samples as compared
to a perfect bcc at the density of the crystalline sample. The first two ratios of gK−K (r)
peaks in the crystalline sample display the same behavior than a perfect bcc while the two first
points of the amorphous sample have a different behavior. As a result, we assert that the local
environment up to the third coordination shell of the crystalline solid has bcc characteristics.
The difference between the crystalline and amorphous samples are evident.
Another analysis of the atomic structure of the two solids is done with the Common Neighbor
Analysis (CNA) algorithm [8, 9] that computes a fingerprint for pairs of atoms. Having two atom
types requires the use of the Adaptive CNA (a-CNA) method [10]. This method determines the
optimum cutoff radius of the coordination shell for each type of atom separately. Results from

the a-CNA (as implemented in the Ovito package [11]) are given in Table 2. The crystalline
solid manifests a high number of bcc atoms with about 20 % of other crystal symmetries
due to boundary atoms between the K matrix and the Na cluster. On the other hand, the
amorphous solid shows insignificant number of atoms that retain a local crystal environment.
In summary, the structural analyses provide support that the solid samples obtained below the
meting temperature can be differentiated not only by their thermodynamic behavior, but also
by their structural signatures. The crystalline branch contains a matrix of potassium atoms
that span the computational box and encase an extended cluster of sodium atoms. Meanwhile,
the amorphous solid displays an amorphous matrix of potassium atoms encasing several clusters
of sodium atoms that are themselves also amorphous. The characteristics of the amorphous
solid discourage identification with a glassy solid.

Conclusions

This study shows that MMC-NPT simulations with the SMA model potential of the NaK
eutectic alloy predicts well an alloy melting region around 250-260 K and displays two solid
branches below the melting temperature, a crystalline solid and an amorphous solid. The
enthalpy and density as a function of temperature, as well as the structural properties of the
two types of solids, ensure their profound differences. The crystalline solid is composed of a
matrix of potassium atoms that span the computational box and has a bcc crystal structure
with an embedded extended cluster of sodium atoms where the bcc structure is not evident.
The amorphous solid is composed of an amorphous matrix of potassium atoms with several
embedded sodium clusters that are also amorphous. The structural characteristics observed in
the amorphous solid are not consistent with a glassy solid having homogeneously distributed
minority atoms.
