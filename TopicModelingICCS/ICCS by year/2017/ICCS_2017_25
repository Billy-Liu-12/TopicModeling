A Spectral Collocation Method for
. . ./ Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 725–734Sharp and Trummer
N. Systems
Sharp et al.

The method presented here is a spectral collocation method for solving linear and nonlinear
coupled systems of second-order boundary value problems which we will refer to as BLRSC
(Boundary Layer Resolving Spectral Collocation) method. We use iterated sine transformations
as described in [8] in conjunction with a Chebyshev spectral collocation method. A variant of
this method was implemented in [4] for linear problems; our implementation and choice of
parameters produce, however, more accurate results. This method is spectrally accurate and
can resolve extremely thin boundary layers. The BLRSC method is very flexible, allowing one
to solve a system of second-order singularly perturbed BVPs with any type of coupling (strong
and/or weak) and different perturbation parameters in each equation.

Introductory Example
A singularly perturbed boundary value problem is one where the coefficient  in front of the
highest order derivative is small, for example,
εu (x) = g(x, u, u ),
with appropriate boundary conditions. An application (a first order equation) of a singular
perturbed problem is from [5], namely a model of an armature controlled DC-motor


u
εv 

= av
= bu − Rv + w,

where u, v, and w are speed, current, and voltage, respectively; R and ε are armature resistance
and inductance, and a and b are some constants specific to the motor. In most DC-motors ε is
a small parameter.

Method
Linear BLRSC Method
The BLRSC method for a single BVP is described in [8]. Now, we consider a system of coupled
boundary value problems





ε1 u1 (x) + p11 (x)u1 (x) + p12 (x)u2 (x) + q11 (x)u1 (x) + q12 (x)u2 (x)

= f1 (x)
= f2 (x).

First, we transform the system to have the domain x ∈ [−1, 1] if needed. Then, making the
transformation x = x(y), where v1 is the transplant of u1 , v1 (y) = u1 (x(y)) and v2 is the
transplant of u2 , v2 (y) = u2 (x(y)) (and after some rearranging), we have

For the coordinate transformation x → y we employ the one-to-one mapping x(y) = gm (y)
given in [8]
π

g0 (y) = y,
gm−1 (y) ,
gm (y) = sin
m ≥ 1.
(1)
2

An interesting question concerns the choice of m. One can easily show (see [8]) that for the
Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes xj = cos(jπ/N , j = 0, . . . , N – the collocation points used in
our method – we have the following estimate for the spacing of the points near the ends of the
intervals:
gm (x0 ) − gm (x1 ) = gm (xN −1 ) − gm (xN ) = O(N −2

m+1

);

(2)

for m = 0, 1, 2, 3 we have spacing of O(1/N 2 ), O(1/N 4 ), O(1/N 8 , and O(1/N 16 ), respectively.
To numerically resolve the boundary layer, N and m must be chosen so that that spacing is
smaller than the width of the boundary layer. For small ε – say ε <= 10−8 – one would typically
choose m = 2 or m = 3.
After this coordinate transformation, we use the standard Chebyshev spectral collocation
method (using global polynomial functions and collocating at the Chebyshev points of the
second kind) on the transformed system. The system of equations to be solved can be written
as:
Ev  + P v  + Qv = f

where cj = 1, for 0 < j < N and c0 = cN = 2. When computing the matrix elements,
however, we only use the above formulas for the off-diagonal elements, i.e., only formula (5).
The diagonal elements are computed with the “negative sum trick”,

Dii = −

(8)
D00 = −DN N =

where the elements in the sum are ordered according to magnitude, see [2]. The second order
differentiation matrix is constructed by squaring the first order differentiation matrix, D(2) =
D2 .

Nonlinear BLRSC Method
Here, we simply extend the method just described and apply it to nonlinear systems. The
coordinate transformation remains the same, but how the equation itself is transformed depends
upon the specific system under consideration. We employ Newton’s method to deal with the
nonlinearity. Specifically, once the original problem has been transformed to the domain [−1, 1]
(if necessary) and the appropriate sine transformations have been applied to the equation,
we will compute the Jacobian. We define our system (which is now in v(y) after the sine
transformations) as follows:
0 = g(v1 , v2 )
0 = h(v1 , v2 )

= ε1 v1 + f1 (v1 , v2 , v1 , v2 , y, ε1 , ε2 )
= ε2 v2 + f2 (v1 , v2 , v1 , v2 , y, ε1 , ε2 ) .

(9)

Discretizing and replacing the derivatives with differentiation matrices we have
G(V1 , V2 ) = ε1 D(2) V1 + f1 (DV1 , DV2 , V1 , V2 , y, ε1 , ε2 )
H(V1 , V2 ) = ε2 D(2) V2 + f2 (DV1 , DV2 , V1 , V2 , y, ε1 , ε2 ) .
We then write our Jacobian in block form as
 ∂G

i

 ∂V1j

J =
 ∂H
i

∂V1j

∂Gi 
∂V2j 


∂H 
i

∂V2j

where Vkj = vk (yj ). We can thus state Newton’s method as
 new = V
 old − J −1 [G H]T ;
V

(10)

of course, the actual implementation involves solving a linear system with the matrix J, not
the computation of its inverse.

The last row of Table 1 shows the results obtained by Cen’s method for N = 1024. Results
reported in [3] show a slightly worse than O(1/N ) convergence, whereas the BLRSC method
shows spectral convergence. Referring to [3] for more error results, it can be seen that results
obtained using the BLRSC method for N ≥ 128 are far more accurate than those in [3], even
for very small ε1 , ε2 . For most methods in the literature similar to this, the goal was to develop
an ε-invariant method. Although our method is not ε-invariant, the BLRCS method achieves
much small max-norm error, even for reasonably small N .

solving coupled systems of singularly perturbed boundary value problems. It involves mapping
the Chebyshev points to a set of transformed points which are determined by the coupling
present in the system and the value of ε. The method then employs rational interpolation
and the differentiation matrices from rational interpolants in barycentric form, achieving high
accuracy.
The paper [4] compares the RSC-sinh to an implementation of the BLRSC method as well
as other methods, although without much explanation. Our BLRSC results achieve higher
accuracy than the ones reported in [4], especially for smaller values of ε. This is partly due
to our use of a more appropriate number of sine transformations (for example, with ε = 10−8
Chen et al. used one sine transformation whereas we use three). An additional reason for the
smaller error in our computations is probably the result of how the differentiation matrices are
computed, since the difference was most noticeable for small values of ε and large values of N .
Figures 3, and 4 show two cases of this example with ε = 10−8 , and 10−12 .

While the RSC-sinh method still produces better accuracy than the BLRSC method, there
are several advantages of the BLRSC method, foremost its ease of implementation and flexibility.
The RSC-sinh method requires knowledge of the boundary layer width, the type of coupling,
and makes assumptions about the coupling matrices (P and Q in equation (3)). For the BLRSC
method, there is no need for this information except that the width of the layer, or the size
of ε , determines the optimal number of sine transformations, which can easily be derived
heuristically and has to be chosen only from a small range of values (0 ≤ m ≤ 3). The RSCsinh method as presented in the paper by Chen et al. does not allow for different values of the
perturbation parameter εj . In contrast, the BLRSC method presented here allows for ε1 and
ε2 to be different, according to the literature an important feature in applications.

Conclusion
The method presented in this paper is a competitive method for numerically solving coupled
systems of singularly perturbed BVPs. In terms of accuracy it far outperforms approaches
based on subdivided meshes and finite difference methods and performs nearly as well as other
fine-tuned spectral methods. The BLRSC method of this paper, however, is perhaps more
versatile than other methods. The coefficient functions of the equation must guarantee existence
and uniqueness of the solution, but no additional assumptions have to be made. The only

parameter that must be chosen (aside from the number of collocation points) is the number
of sine transformations, m, where 0 ≤ m ≤ 3, and this can be done with a heuristic approach
based on the size of the perturbation parameters ε1 and ε2 . The BLRSC method can deal with
nonlinearities; it is also computationally efficient.
