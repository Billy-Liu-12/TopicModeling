and write (3) as (K − ωk M)xk = b, for xk := [ωk xk , xk ]T and b := [b, 0]T . We will consider
the case C ≡ 0 independently. The matrix equation (2) then reduces to two terms, and we can
identify K = K as well as M = M and avoid doubling of dimensions in (3). In this paper, we
review and compare the following recently developed algorithms:
• Global GMRES [13] for the matrix equation approach [6] (cf. Algorithm 1),
• Polynomial preconditioners [1, 8] for multi-shift GMRES (cf. Algorithm 2),
• Nested multi-shift FOM-FGMRES as presented in [7] (cf. Algorithm 3-4).

Note that this list does not consider a comparison with the algorithms suggested by [5, 17]
and by [20]. Moreover, we restrict ourselves to GMRES-variants of the respective algorithms,
and refer to [4] for global IDR(s) and to [7] for the more memory-efficient combination nested
IDR-QMRIDR(s). In [1] a shifted polynomial preconditioner is used within multi-shift BiCG.
The derivations in Section 2 emphasize that the cost-per-iteration of each proposed algorithm
is comparable. In Section 3, we evaluate the three approaches for a benchmark problem of the
discretized time-harmonic elastic wave equation.

Iterative Krylov methods for multi-frequency wave
propagation problems

The review of the subsequent algorithms is based on our works [6, 7, 8].

2.1

Preconditioned matrix equation approach

The matrix equation (2) with right preconditioning reads,
A(P (τ )−1 Y) = B,

X = P (τ )−1 Y,

where P (τ ) := (K + iτ C − τ 2 M )−1 ,

(5)

and A(·) as in (2). A similar reformulation has been suggested in [20]. We note that the
preconditioner P (τ ) can be applied inexactly using, for instance, an incomplete LU factorization.
The (possibly complex) parameter τ is called the seed frequency. In Algorithm 1, we state the
global GMRES method [13]. Note that in the block Arnoldi method the trace inner product is
used, and norms are replaced by the Frobenius norm ·F for block matrices. After m iterations,
an approximate solution to (2) in the block Krylov subspace Km (AP (τ )−1 , B) is obtained.

2.2

Preconditioners for shifted linear systems

first-level preconditioner, a shift-and-invert preconditioner of the form,

is applied. Based on the decomposition (6) we note that P (τ )−1 = (K + iτ C − τ 2 M )−1 as
defined in (5) is the main computational work and, hence, the work-per-iteration is comparable
to Algorithm 1. For the block systems (3), the following equivalence holds,
(K − ωk M)Pk−1 yk = b

⇔

(KP(τ )−1 − ηk I)yk = b,

(7)

where ηk := ωk /(ωk − τ ), and Pk−1 := (1 − ηk )P(τ )−1 = (1 − ηk )(K − τ M)−1 . Note that
the latter is a preconditioned shifted linear system with (complex) shifts ηk and system matrix
C := KP(τ )−1 = K(K − τ M)−1 . Due to the equivalence in (7), the preconditioner (6) needs to
be applied exactly. Moreover, right-preconditioning implies the back-substitution xk = Pk−1 yk .
2.2.1

Shifted Neumann preconditioners

After applying the shift-and-invert preconditioner (6) to (3), we remain with solving,
(C − ηk I)yk = b,

xk = Pk−1 yk ,

k = 1, ..., nω ,

(8)

where C = KP(τ )−1 , and with (complex) shifts ηk = ωk /(ωk − τ ). Efficient algorithms for
shifted linear systems (8) rely on the shift-invariance property, Km (C, b) ≡ Km (C − ηI, b), for
any shift η ∈ C; cf. [12, 18]. The (preconditioned) spectrum of the matrix C is known to be
enclosed by a circle of radius R and center c [8, 21]. Therefore, the Neumann preconditioner

Inner-outer Krylov methods

In this approach, we modify (8) by the substitutions, K̄ := K − ω1 M, C¯ := K̄P(τ )−1 , and solve
the equivalent systems,
ω k − ω1
, k = 1, ..., nω ,
(13)
(C¯ − η̄k I)yk = b, η̄k :=
ωk − τ
¯ 1 = b (unshifted). A nested multiwith the advantage that for k = 1 we solve the base system Cy
shift Krylov algorithm consists in general of mi inner iterations and mo outer iterations. The
nested FOM-FGMRES algorithm [7] is a combination of inner multi-shift FOM (Algorithm 3)
with outer flexible multi-shift GMRES (Algorithm 4). In [7] we derive that if the inner method
yields collinear residuals in the sense,

(14)

for rj being the residual of the base system after mi inner iterations, we can preserve shiftinvariance in the outer method. The consecutive collinearity factors of the inner method then
appear on a diagonal matrix Γk of a modified Hessenberg matrix in the outer loop (see line 13
in Algorithm 4 and [7], respectively). More precisely, after mo outer iterations, the solution to,

Numerical experiments

We focus our numerical experiments on linear systems (1) that stem from a finite element
discretization [2, 6] of the time-harmonic elastic wave equation [10]:
−ωk2 ρuk − ∇·σ(uk ) = s,
iωk ρ B(cp , cs )uk + σ(uk )n̂ = 0,
σ(uk )n̂ = 0,

a free-surface boundary condition on ∂Ωr (reflection). A finite element discretization1 with
basis functions that are B-splines [9, Chapter 2] of degree p ∈ N>0 yields,
(K + iωk C − ωk2 M )uk = s,

where uk contains FEM coefficients of the k-th displacement vector, and s models a timeharmonic source term. In the case of purely reflecting boundary conditions, ∂Ωa = ∅, we obtain
C = 0; cf. [6]. The inhomogeneous set of parameters {ρ, cp , cs } is described in Figure 1a. In
Figure 1b, we prescribe material-air boundary conditions at the upper boundary only, and a
point source at (Lx /2, 0)T .

numerical examples presented in this section have been implemented in Python-3, and executed

Experiment #1: Convergence study for viscous damping
As a first numerical experiment we consider the case when viscous damping is added to (17) via
the substitution ωk → (1 − i)ωk for  > 0. As we explain in Section 2.2.1, the spectral radius
of the polynomial preconditioner (9) can be minimized as a result of the optimal seed frequency
τ ∗ () derived in [8]. Table 1 demonstrates that an increase of the polynomial degree n reduces

in (9).

Experiment #2: Suitability for wide frequency ranges
We next consider the undamped problem ( = 0) with Sommerfeld boundary conditions (see
Figure 1b) which is numerically more challenging. Here, we use n = 0 in Algorithm 2 because
the spectral radius of the polynomial preconditioner is R/|c| ≡ 1, cf. [8, 21]. The experiments
in Table 3 and 4 show that the matrix equation approach requires a large number of iterations,
especially when the number of frequencies is increased. This is due to the fact that the union
of the preconditioned spectra needs to be well approximated by the global GMRES method.

shows that the preconditioner (5) acts on the block diagonals which demonstrates that the
block Krylov subspace in Algorithm 1 needs to approximate the union of the spectra whereas
in the shifted systems approach only one space is built due to shift-invariance. This drawback is
partly overcome by applying appropriate rotations to the spectrum as we show in detail in [8].

Experiment #3: Inexact solves for the shift-and-invert preconditioner
In Table 5 we exploit the use of an inexact LU factorization2 for the shift-and-invert preconditioner in Algorithm 1. Therefore, we extend the test case in Figure 1a to 3D by an expansion
in y-direction. The measured CPU times indicate the trade-off between decomposition time
and overall number of iterations. In practice, more advanced inexact preconditioners such as
multigrid [14, 15] or hierarchical matrix decompositions [3, 6] are used for seismic applications.

Conclusions

We have compared three GMRES-based algorithms for the simultaneous iterative solution of
frequency-domain wave propagation problems at multiple frequencies that have the discretized
form (1). The three approaches share that they require the application of a single shift-andinvert preconditioner at a so-called seed frequency. From our numerical experiments we draw
the following conclusions:
• In the presence of viscous damping (Experiment #1) the optimal seed parameter derived
in [8] implies a polynomial preconditioner (Algorithm 2) which, depending on the degree n
2 We

8

use python’s built-in incomplete LU factorization scipy.sparse.linalg.spilu.

of the polynomial, leads to a significant reduction of the number of multi-shift GMRES
iterations. Without viscous damping, however, the spectral radius of the polynomial
preconditioner equals one and no improvement has been observed.
• The matrix equation approach (Algorithm 1) builds up a block Krylov space that needs to
approximate the union of all preconditioned spectra. This leads to a much larger number
of overall iterations, and a worse performance compared with the shifted systems approach
when a wide range of frequencies is considered. Because of the less restrictive framework,
however, the shift-and-invert preconditioner (5) can be applied inexactly which leads to
improvements especially for 3D problems (Experiment #3). Moreover, the benefits of efficient block matrix-vector products when multiple sources are considered is demonstrated
in [6].
• For a wide frequency range (Experiment #2) we observe that the nested algorithm 3-4
outperforms the considered alternatives with respect to measured CPU time. This is due
to shorter loops in the respective Arnoldi iterations. From the summary in Table 6 we
note that the storage requirements for the flexible outer Krylov method can be limited
when mo is small compared to mi .
