grid control. The ability of these PMUs to time-synchronize three phase AC voltage and current
phasor measurements from various points in a wide geographical distribution in a power grid
with a precise global positioning system (GPS) clock has improved the feasibility of analyzing
the operating status of a wide area power grid.
Although high sampling rate of PMUs is beneficial for grid protection, it also presents
challenges in the storage and analysis of large volumes of data. To provide some solution to the
storage and analysis problem, the event detection scheme in [9] provides an efficient solution
of archiving data for analysis, only if a grid event or grid disturbance is detected. Hence,
automated or semi-automated analysis techniques [5, 6, 12] to automatically classify grid events
into relevant load or generation perturbations such as faults, out-of-step conditions, power
generation anomalies are highly desirable. Such techniques greatly automate grid monitoring
by extracting relevant information from PMU data and classify grid disturbance events.
Most of the power blackouts are typically caused by a single event that leads to cascading
outages [14]. Clearly, it is critical to develop a PMU synchrophasor data analysis scheme that
not only detects but also identifies the cause of these events to prevent potential cascading
grid failures. This paper builds on a systematic data analysis procedure that uses the following
3 subsequent steps: event detection [3, 8, 9], parameter estimation [11, 18] and event classification [6, 12]. More specifically, the event detection involves detecting unusual occurrences of
critical events in a power grid such as transient switching, outages, faults, line trips and intentional system test events like the Chief Joseph brake test. The parameter estimation involves
estimating critical parameters of the disturbance event and extracting the features that relate
these parameters to a specific type of event. Event classification involves grouping events according to its type, cause and extent of effect on the grid and attributing such events to specific
components in the grid.
Data based event classification techniques such as neural networks, multiple linear regressions, generalized linear modeling, regression trees have been extensively studied [16]. Also,
dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) [2], [17] have
become a great interest due to their faster computation features. However, the separate steps
of event detection, parameter estimation and event classification have to be carried accurately
and in a timely manner in order to prevent propagation of such outages or blackouts. The
first step involving automated event detection has been recently addressed by in [9], whereas
the next two steps are the focus of this paper. Additional event localization [3] can be used to
identifying the approximate location of the origin of the event.
For the illustration and application of this methodology, real-time PMU data acquisition has
been implemented for IEEE C37.118 formatted data from a microPMU system developed by
Power Standards Lab (PSL). Event detection is performed in a distributed sense on a Raspberry
PI processing the C37.118 data stream of a single PMU and detect events as described in [9].
It is shown how real-time processing of the phasor data received by C37.118 can be used to
extract features which then can be used as a training set to classify recorded events. The
training and testing data sets consist of event instances created from measurements of the
single phase phasors (frequency) from the wall outlet in the Synchrophasor Grid Monitoring
and Automation (SyGMA) lab at UCSD over several months.

Power Oscillations in Grid Dynamics

Modern power grids are mostly interconnected and operate close to the stability limits in
transient and steady state modes [14]. Natural response of one group of closely coupled machines
oscillate against one another in large interconnected grids. Higher frequency modes are localized

with small groups that oscillate against each other. A small disturbance in any part of the
system can initiate an inter-area oscillation, in a heavily interconnected grid. These oscillations,
especially if lightly damped, can lead to a line trips due to protective relay trips and inducing
a grid system collapse [15].
In a power system with multiple machines, measurements at nearby buses show coherent
oscillation characteristics. As a result, changes in real power can be seen on frequency measurements while changes in reactive power can be seen in voltage measurements [14]. To illustrate
the transient phenomenon in a largely interconnected power grid, consider a simple two-area
power system model with two machines M1, M2 (each modeling generation and load) connected
via a single bus.
Assuming that the machines M1 and M2 operating at voltages V1 and V2 , start at initial angles
δ1 and δ2 respectively with respect to reference nominal frequency and that M1 accelerates while
M2 de-accelerates from their nominal rotation frequency. Excluding random variation of load
caused by demands, let us consider only the frequency dependent load variation linearized with
a coefficient β, allowing us to write
2H2 ¨

δ1 = Pm1 − Pe1 + β1 δ˙1 and
δ2 = Pm2 − Pe2 + β2 δ˙2

where Pmi indicates the mechanical power output in area i, Pei indicates real power flow in/out
of area i, Hi indicates the area inertia constant, ωs indicates the synchronous frequency and
subscripts i = 1, 2 refer to areas of M1 and M2 respectively. Assuming that the transmission
line is lossless, with line impedance X, then power flows from M1 to M2 can be represented by
Pe1 = −Pe2 =

V1 V2
sin(δ12 )
X

(2)

where δ12 = δ1 − δ2 . In steady state operation for the lossless transmission, the generated power
at M1 is absorbed through M2 and therefore Pm1 = −Pm2 .
Combining the equations (1) and (2), one obtains

from which it can be seen that a two-area system with H1 = H2 = H, β1 = β2 = β, the
normalized voltage units V1 = V2 = 1 and Pm1 = Pm2 = 0 follows

with an (undamped) oscillation frequency ω = HX
The purposes of the abovementioned analysis is to show that the power flow (2) of a twoarea power system behaves much like a damped mass-spring system with natural (undamped)
oscillation frequency ω > 0 and damping ratio 0 ≤ β ≤ 1. Since an electromechanical oscillation is an exchange of kinetic energy through electrical power between various machines,
the oscillation takes a specific path through the grid [15]. In a large grid, e.g. the Western
Electric Coordinating Council (WECC), there may be several such areas and the transmission
system may have several resonance modes with coupling and possibly non-linear effects. The
unavoidable phenomena of power oscillations due to rotating machine inertia will be exploited
in the feature extraction whenever power disturbances occur on the grid.

3.1

Parameter Estimation for Feature Extraction
Free Response Dynamic Model

In a large interconnected grid (e.g. WECC) that can consist of several load-generation areas, it
becomes very difficult to derive the swing equations due to highly coupled non-linear dynamic
behavior between areas. As an alternative, we deploy system identification techniques to extract
information from the grid each time an event occurs [11]. The realization algorithm [7] is used
here to identify modal parameters of the power oscillation dynamics, assuming the free response
of a linear dynamic behavior excited by a (im)pulse signal.
For the realization algorithm, consider a linear dynamic model
x(k + 1)
y(k)

=
=

Ax(k) + Bu(k)
Cx(k) + Du(k)

(5)

is used to capture the free response of the power oscillation or grid frequency oscillations y(k) at
discrete times, t = k∆T, k = 0, 1, . . . with a constant sampling time ∆T . In this paper we choose
to use y(k) to be the supply frequency f (k) of the AC voltage signal as provided by a PMU.
The motivation to use the measured AC supply frequency f (k) is due to the strong correlation
between f (k) and real power flow P (k) in a grid with rotating machinery as discussed in the
the previous section. In addition, it is much easier to measure fluctuation in the AC supply
frequency f (k) via a PMU, without having to measure both AC voltage and AC current for
power flow calculation. That said, feature extraction can also be applied to power measurements
without loss of generality.
In (5), the vector x(k) ∈ Rn×1 denotes a n-dimensional state vector, A ∈ Rn×n is the state
matrix, B ∈ Rn×1 is the input matrix, C ∈ R1×n is the output matrix and D ∈ R1×1 is the
feedthrough scalar/matrix with C and D having (only) a single row, the analysis presented
here assumes a single (output) measurement. However, the approach can be easily extended
to multiply synchronized PMU measurements where C and D have may multiple rows. With
the model (5), the (impulse) input u(k) and power or frequency measurement y(k) are related
via the Markov parameters g(k) = CAk−1 B for k > 0 and allow the input/output dynamic
relation to be written as a discrete-time convolution
∞

y(k) = Du(k) +
g(j)u(k − j)
j=1

where y(k) = g(k) due to the (im)pulse input u(k). Our goal is to estimate the order n of the
model and then compute (realize) the matrices A, B and C of the model based on discretetime power or frequency swing observations y(k). These matrices are then used to extract the
relevant parameters to quantify the event.

3.2

Realization Algorithm for Model Estimation

For the realization algorithm, one uses 2N discrete-time measurements y(k), k = 1, 2, . . . , 2N
to construct a Hankel matrix H and the corresponding shifted Hankel matrix H̄ of the same
size given by

where it can be shown that H̄ = H1 AH2 where H1 ∈ RN ×n , H2 ∈ Rn×N are a rank n
decomposition H = H1 H2 of the Hankel matrix H. Such a rank n decomposition can be
computed via a Single Value Decomposition (SVD) H = U ΣV T where U, V ∈ RN ×N are
orthonormal matrices and Σ ∈ RN ×N is a diagonal matrix with N singular values ordered in a
non-decreasing magnitude on the main diagonal.
Choosing a fixed model order n, the SVD allows a rank n approximation H ≈ Un Σn VnT of
the full rank N matrix H, where Un ∈ RN ×n indicates the first n columns in U , Σn ∈ Rn×n
the first n rows and n columns of Σ and Vn ∈ RN ×n indicates the first n columns in V . The

C = H1 (1, :), where H2 (:, 1) ∈ Rn×1 denotes the first column in H1 and H1 (1, :) ∈ R1×n
denotes the first row of H1 .

3.3

Model Based Feature Extraction

For feature extraction we consider transient dynamic behavior stability of the model, determined
by the eigenvalues λi , i = 1, 2, . . . , n of the estimated state matrix A. In addition to the
eigenvalues of A, also the nullspace solutions to [A − λi I]φi = 0 and ψi [A − λi I] = 0 are
computed to find the left ψi and right φi eigenvectors. The information on the (complex)
eigenvalues λi , left ψi and right φi eigenvectors are now used to compute the main dynamic
features of a power of frequency oscillation event y(k), k = 1, 2, . . .: the oscillation frequencies
fi , damping ratios ζi and relative participation factors Pi of the event, respectively given by
fi =

|si |
−ai
, ζi =
, Pi = |φi ψi |
2π
2πfi

(6)

where si = 60 ln(λi ) = ai ± jbi for 60Hz sampling of the data y(k).
The frequency fi , damping ζi and participation factor Pi , collectively called the (dynamic
event) parameters in (6) are used to characterize the dynamic aspects of an observed event
and motivated as follows. Firstly, oscillating areas may be characterized by different modes or
oscillation frequencies fi . Secondly, the damping factor ζi plays an important role in determining the nature of the oscillation mode and will help in deciding whether the disturbance event
occurred in the main or local grid area. For example, it was found that undamped oscillations
at about 0.33 Hz was the major restraint on a larger transfer [15] in the WECC system caused
by generator high gain automatic voltage regulators (AVR). Next, the participation factors Pi
can be used to characterize the relative contribution of each oscillation mode and decide the
source of the oscillation event. Finally, next to the listed (dynamic event) parameters in (6)
that capture the dynamic behavior of a power oscillation event, also the static behavior is used
in event characterization. The static parameter is characterized by the post-event deviation of
the measured frequency amplitude ∆F before and after the event and computed via

Feature Based Clustering for Grid Event Classification

Computational techniques such as distribution based cluster analysis, a type of unsupervised
machine learning can be used to identify different patterns. In this paper, the k-nearest neighbor
algorithm is used to find patterns and classify the event. The k-means clustering method is a
method used in a p-dimensional space, with an L1 -norm distance measure used for minimization
of the distance from the point to centroid. The L1 is the sum of absolute differences, also known
as the ‘city block distance’.
The goal of the algorithm is to partition the given data {x1 , x2 , ..., xn } ∈ Rd into k disjoint
clusters C = {C1 , ..., Ck } such that the sum of the cluster elements from the cluster centroid is
minimized. Each centroid is the component-wise median of the points in that particular cluster.
Formally, the problem can be formulated. Given a set of k cluster centers C = {c1 , ..., ck }, where
x, c ∈ Rd , the k-means objective function for L1 distance minimization is given by
J(C, C) =

k



j=1 xi ∈Cj

|xi − cj |

(7)

and the cost function J(C, C) (7) is non-convex. As a result, the problem of finding the global
minimum of the k-means objective needs to be solved via a non-linear minimization, initialized
at an initial centroid value cj .
Once clustering has been achieved, it is worthwhile to give the computed clusters C a
meaningful interpretation. The interpretation can be based on the fact that power system
oscillations are classified by the system components that they effect. Traditionally, oscillation
modes are classified based on oscillating frequencies alone [19], although damping is included
in most calculation. The classical frequency distinction results in so-called interarea mode
oscillations (f <≤ 1 Hz and typically around 0.3 Hz), local plant mode oscillations (1.0 <
f ≤ 2.0 Hz), intraplant mode oscillations (2.0 < f <≤ 3.0 Hz), torsional mode oscillations
(10 < f < 16 Hz) and control mode oscillations. But the participation Pi of each such oscillating
frequencies is often overlooked. In some cases, there might be an event caused by more than
one of such modes of oscillation. Hence consideration of participation factor of each of such
participating mode would provide better insights for classification.

Application of Clustering PMU Frequency Data
Frequency and Participation Factor Clustering

To illustrate the clustering of oscillation modes based on frequency domain data, PMU data
acquisition has been implemented for IEEE C37.118 data from the microPMU system developed
by Power Standards Lab (PSL). Event detection is performed as described in [9] and detect
events based on the single phase AC supply frequency measurements from the wall outlet in
the lab over several months. Using the set of measured events, first the k-means clustering
algorithm is applied to a 2-dimensional space with natural frequency fi of oscillation and the
participation factor Pi of that oscillation frequency fi . The resulting number of clusters are
chosen to be 4 and the results of the feature (frequency fi and partition factor Pi ) extraction
is depicted in Fig. 1. From the automated clustering results depicted in in Fig. 1, the following
interesting conclusions may be drawn. Cluster 1 may be defined as the cluster containing the
very-low frequency interarea (VLFI) oscillations of the grid. These oscillations occur in almost
every detected event usually at a higher participation factors Pi > 40%. These oscillations are

a result of large coherent generation areas in the WECC system swinging against each other
and hence can be seen for almost every excitation in the WECC system. These oscillations do
not provide any useful information in event classification as they inadvertently occur in almost
every event. Cluster 2 may be defined as the cluster containing the low participation frequency
interarea (LPFI) oscillations of the grid. These consist of the typical interarea oscillations in
the WECC system that exhibit frequency oscillations of fi ∼ 0.3 and have a lower participation
Pi in the events. Moreover, this is usually associated with a frequency component from Cluster
1. Cluster 3 may be defined as the cluster containing the high participation frequency interarea
(HPFI) oscillations of the grid. These consist of the typical interarea oscillations in the WECC
system that exhibit frequency oscillations of fi ∼ 0.3 Hz and have a significant participation
Pi in any grid event. Finally, Cluster 4 may be defined as the cluster containing the frequency
torsional mode (FT) oscillations of the grid. Usually these modes are excited when a multi-stage
turbine generator is connected to the grid system through a series compensated line.

5.2

Frequency, Participation Factor and Damping Clustering

Although the above description may provide an intuitive clustering of events, the clustering
approach in this paper can be extended to allow further classification based on damping ratio.
This method of classification helps differentiate between oscillations initiated in the local or the
main grid in the WECC system due to variation of damping levels in each of these cases. Hence,
three-dimensional k-means clustering involving natural frequency of oscillation fi , participation
factor Pi and damping factor ζi is performed. We keep the same number of 4 clusters as in
Fig 1, but include damping ratio as the third dimension for classification. The clustering
results are shown in Fig. 2. The 3-dimensional clustering provides an intuition about the
events that occur locally (close to the measurement point) or non-locally (far-off from the
measurement point). Cluster 1 contains very low frequency components with very high damping
which does not contain any signature of an event. Hence components falling in cluster 1 can
be ignored for classification of events into local/non-local events. Cluster 2 may be defined
as the cluster containing frequency components around 0.3 Hz WECC frequency with low
participation, low damping factor signifying that these may be the components present in the
local grid events. Cluster 3 may be defined as the cluster containing frequency components

these may be the components present in the non-local events such as the Chief Joseph break
test. Cluster 4 depicts high frequency torsional oscillations that occur at very low levels of

5.3

Steady State Frequency Deviation Clustering

Finally, single dimensional classification of grid events resulting in steady state frequency deviations can also be performed. Application of the k-means clustering on the difference of the
frequency before and after the event ∆F in (3.3) will provide additional information on a particular grid event in terms of steady state power loss or power surplus. These events may be
caused due to unexpected generation trip or sudden load loss in an area. The resulting clusters
based on ∆F are shown in Fig. 3. The events that fall in Cluster 1 do not show any significant
steady state frequency level ∆F deviation and hence do not fall under generation loss events.
Whereas the events in Cluster 2 show a steady state frequency deviation ∆F > 0.04 Hz and
can be interpreted as generation surplus (or load loss) during the event.

5.4

Validation on PMU Data Events

The deduced rules for event classification of grid event can be applied on a set of events not used
for (the training of) the clustering algorithm. This validation will demonstrate the robustness
of the classification algorithm. For this purpose frequency PMU data from three measured
known events are used: (1) the Chief Joseph Brake test on April 14th 2015 (WECC event), (2)
the disturbance caused during a major Tornado warning issued in San Diego on January 6th
2016 (local event) and (3) the loss of major resources in Montana (generation loss) on January
21st 2016 measured from Coronado substation. Table 1 shows the classification of these three
events based on the clustering computed on the training set of events. The cluster components

of the first event fall in cluster 1 (VLFI) and cluster 3 (HPFI) of the first classifier, cluster 3
(non-local) of the second classifier and cluster 1 of the third classifier. Hence, this event can be
classified as a HPFI, non-local event without any power loss. Similarly, the cluster components
of the second event fall in cluster 1 (VLFI) and cluster 2 (LPFI) of the first classifier, cluster
2 (local) of the second classifier and cluster 1 of the third classifier. Hence, this event can be
classified as a LPFI, local event without any power loss. Finally, the cluster components of the
third event fall in cluster 1 (VLFI) and cluster 3 (HPFI) of the first classifier, cluster 3 (nonlocal) of the second classifier and cluster 2 of the third classifier. This event can be classified
as a HPFI, non-local event with generation loss, affirming the credibility of the algorithm.

Conclusions and Future work

This paper shows combining estimation of dynamic event parameters combined with standard
clustering methods can be used to build classifiers to quantify power grid oscillation events on
synchrophasor data. The event parameters included frequencies, damping and participation
factors of each oscillation mode in an event and can be estimated by realization algorithm.
Application of the feature based grid event classification to actual PMU synchrophasor data
obtained from a microPMU shows realistic clustering based classification of various detected
disturbance events. Our future work will implement the event classification algorithm in realtime on a PMU connected client computer to detect and automatically classify grid events.
