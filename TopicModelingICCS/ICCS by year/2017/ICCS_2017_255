size of the analyzed sequence alphabet) for smaller periods with a multiple of the length (Korotkov et
al. 2003). Also, these methods are very sensitive to the insertion and deletion of symbols. This leads to
the fact that spectral methods cannot detect periodicity at a statistically significant level, even in the
presence of a few deletions or insertions.
Dynamic programming, which allows the detection of deletions and insertions in the periods,
cannot detect relatively "fuzzy" periodicity. This is due to the fact that this method is based on finding
the similarity between pairs of periods in the studied sequence (Benson 1999). However, if a
statistically significant similarity is absent between two separate periods, dynamic programming will
fail to detect periodicity in the analyzed sequence. The lack of similarity between any two separate
periods can be observed for latent periodicity, where the periodicity occurs on the background of
random noise (Korotkov et al. 2003). To find such periodicity, the method of informational
decomposition was used (Korotkov et al. 2003). This method enabled the discovery of latent
periodicity in the DNA sequences of many genes (Korotkov et al. 1997; Chaley et al. 1999) and
revealed the latency of amino acid specific for the protein families (Turutina et al. 2006; Korotkov et
al. 1999). These results suggest that latent periodicity with insertions and deletions can be detected in
sequences of a different nature and in numerical sequences also.
Today, it is known that people, animals and plants have biological rhythms. The manifestation of
these rhythms can be observed at all levels of biological organization. The interaction can be observed
between the rhythms that affect the internal state of the person and on various social processes. A.
Chizhevsky first drew attention to the influence of natural factors on social processes (Chizhevsky
1976) The biological rhythms can also influence currency rates. If the periods in the exchange rates
exist, then the various events in public life can affect them. Such events can lead to changes in the data
and could be identified as a phase shift of the period. The phase shifts in the sequence could have
resulted from deletion or insertion of values with respect to the existing period. Therefore, in order to
detect this periodicity, it was necessary to develop a mathematical method for detecting the periodicity
of the time series, taking into account the unknown location and unknown number of insertions or
deletions, in the presence of large noise. It cannot be done with the help of all known mathematical
methods. Previous studies have searched for insertions or deletions (Rastogi et al. 2006), but failed to
find a periodicity with large noise (Suvorova et al. 2014). It is right mainly for dynamic programming.
Either of these methods works well in the presence of large noise, but fails to find periodicity in the
presence of even small amounts of insertions and deletions (Korotkov et al. 2003).
This paper contributed to filling the gap in mathematical methods for periodicity search. A
mathematical method was developed to find periodicity in the symbolical sequences, in the presence
of insertions and deletions and the big noise. The method was developed using the random matrices of
periodicity and the method of dynamic programming. The developed method was applied to search for
periodicity in the exchange rate of the Euro to the US Dollar. To search for periodicity, the numerical
sequence was converted to a symbolical sequence. The calculations show that there is a periodicity
equal to 24 and 25 h in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate. This periodicity of the exchange rate contains a
lot of insertions and deletions and could not be detected by previously developed mathematical
methods.

2 Methods and Algorithms
To search the periodicity with insertions and deletions, the algorithm shown in Figure 1 was used.
As can be seen from the algorithm, firstly, a set of random matrices (Figure1, paragraph 2) with size
20xn was generated, where n is the length of the period, and 20 is the alphabet size of the studied
sequence. Then, a local alignment of the studied sequence was built relative to each of the generated
random matrices (Figure 1, paragraph 3). Dynamic programming was used to build the local
alignment and in determining the similarity function F. Then, the matrices were transformed because
2

the distribution of the similarity function F maximum for each of the matrices for the set of all random
sequences (set Q, paragraph 2.2) should be similar. The transformed matrix having the highest value
of the similarity function F, with the studied sequence S, was chosen. Then, this matrix was optimized
to achieve the highest value of
the similarity function F (maxF)
with the studied sequence S
(Figure 1, paragraph 4) and the
transformed matrix was called T.
Then, the value of maxF for each
random sequence from the set Q
and for matrix T was calculated.
It allowed the mean value and
variance for maxF to be
determined (Figure 1, paragraphs
5.1-5.4). This algorithm was
applied for periods of different
lengths and for each length of the
period n, the corresponding value
of Z was calculated (formula 7).
As a result of the algorithm, the
dependence of Z on n was
obtained and denoted as Z(n).
(Figure 1, paragraphs 6). It
should be noted that in this study,
dynamic programming was used
to find a local alignment. This
means that the boundaries of the
regions with maxF, may differ
from the beginning and end of

n can be obtained for different fragments of the studied sequence. The boundaries of the fragments,
obtained for relevant values of Z(n) are shown. Subsequently, each step of the algorithm shown in
Figure 1 was examined in more details.

2.1 Creation of a character sequence from a numerical sequence
The numeric sequence A of length N was transformed in the symbolic sequence S with alphabet of
20 letters (Figure 1, paragraph 1). To convert the numerical sequence, the minimum and maximum
elements of the sequence A were determined. Then, this interval was divided into 20 intervals, the
number of elements of the numeric sequence in each interval was approximately equal to N/20. Each
interval received the letter of the Latin alphabet. If a numeric sequence contained many of the equal
values than the boundaries of the intervals were varied in such a way that the same numbers were
encoded by the same symbol.

2.2 Generation of random sequences
A set Q of random sequences was created by random shuffling of the sequence S (Figure 1,
Paragraph 2) and the set Q containing 200 sequences. To generate one random symbolical sequence, a
3

1347

random number sequence of length N was generated by the random number generator. Then, a random
number sequence was arranged in ascending order, storing the generated permutations. The produced
permutations were used for mixing the sequence S, and as a result of this mixing the random symbolic
sequence from the set Q was created.

2.3 Creation of a set of random matrices with length n
Random matrices with the dimension 20xn were used, where n is the length of the period
(Figure 1, Paragraph 3). Each matrix can be viewed as a point in space 20xn. A set of random matrices
W was created when the distance between them in the space 20xn should not be less than a certain
value. To calculate the differences between the two matrices m 1(i,j) and m2(i,j), the information
measure was used (Kullback 1997):

(Kullback 1997). Then we calculated:

(2)

Hence, 2 I ( M 1 , M 2 ) has an approximately F 2 ( df ) and df equal to 19n because I1 ( M1 , M 2 ) ,
I 2 ( M1 , M 2 ) ,…, I n 1 (M 1 , M 2 ) are independent and I n (M 1 , M 2 ) is completely determined by
I1 ( M 1 , M 2 ) , I 2 ( M 1 , M 2 ) ,…, I n 1 ( M 1 , M 2 ) (Kullback 1997). Then we used the approximation of the
chi-square distribution by the normal distribution:
x (M1 , M 2 )
4 I ( M 1 , M 2 )  2df  1
(3)

The value x( M 1 , M 2 ) ~ N (0,1) ɝɞɟ N(0,1) was obtained and is an argument of the standard normal
distribution. N(0,1) is very useful as a measure of the differences between the matrices m1(i,j) and
m2(i,j). The probability p=P(x>x(M1,M2)) shows that the differences between the matrices m1(i,j) and
m2(i,j) are determined by random factors. If the difference between the matrices m1(i,j) and m2(i,j)
increases, then N(0,1) becomes larger. The difference between matrices not less than 1.0 was chosen.
The used algorithm to generate matrices was next. Each element of the matrix m(i,j), i=1,…,20,
j=1,…,n was randomly filled with equal probability either 0 or 1. Then, the matrix was compared with
all matrices, which were already included in the set W. If at least one matrix has this difference, less
than L=1.0, then the generated matrix was not included in the set W. If the difference was greater than
L=1.0 for all matrices from the set W, then the matrix is included in the set W. The 108 of such
matrices were created for each period length n. These matrices were used to construct the alignments
for sequences created in paragraph 2.1.

2.4 Alignment sequence S relative to the random matrices
To search for the periodicity in the sequence S with insertions and deletions, an alignment
sequence S relative to the modified matrices m’ from the W set was performed; a method of modifying
matrices is described below (Figure 1, paragraph 4). To build alignment, the matrix for the similarity
function F was filled, using a modified matrix m’(i,j).

where s(i) - element of the sequence S, d - weight per insertion or deletion of a symbol in the sequence
S. Here, i and j changed from 1 to n; k = j – n*int((j-0.1)/n). This means that the index j always
corresponds to the column of the matrix k. The matrix F has dimension N by N, where N is the length
of the sequence S. Simultaneously, with the filling of the matrix of the similarity function F, the
matrix of inverse transitions F’ was filled. It has the same dimension as the matrix F. Each element of
the matrix F’(i,j) contains the number of the element of the matrix F, for which the maximum is
reached in the formula (4). After filling in the matrices F and F’, the maximum element maxF in the
matrix F and its coordinates (im, jm) were determined. The alignment of the sequence S concerning the
sequence of indices k was created with help of the matrix of the inverse transitions F’, as earlier
described (Polyanovsky et al. 2011). The path in the matrix F from the point (im, jm) to the point (i0, j0)
corresponds to the created alignment. At the point (i0, j0), the function F became equal to zero for the
first time and served as the beginning of the alignment. The first sequence of the alignment is the
sequence of numbers k, and the sequence S is the second sequence in the alignment. Each column k in
the alignment, mapped the symbol of the sequence S, or sign * which indicates that this column is not
mapped to any symbol of the sequence S. Similarly, each symbol of the sequence S is associated with
a specific column k or sign * which indicates that this symbol is not mapped to any column k. To build
the alignments created in paragraph 2.1 and 2.2 sequences, the modified matrix m’ from the set W was
used. Firstly, the values A and B for matrix m were calculated as:

¦¦ m(i, j)

(5)

B

¦¦ m(i, j ) p(i)

(6)
where p(i)=n(i)/N, n(i) is the number of symbols of type i in the sequence S, N is the total number of
symbols in the sequence S.
To carry out the alignment, the matrix m’ needs to satisfy two conditions. The first condition
is that the A values for matrix m’ with the same period length n would be the same and equal to 200*n.
The second condition is that the distribution functions for maxF would be most similar for all matrices
of length n. The distribution for each matrix can be built to align each matrix length n with random
sequences from the set Q and to determine the maxF for each sequence from set Q. The value of the
constant B for each matrix was selected, which provided maximum identity for the distribution
function maxF, for matrices on the set Q with the same n value. The two conditions shown above,
allow the replacement of matrix m on the matrix m’, for which these conditions are satisfied. Equation
(5) is the equation of the surface of the ball in space 20xn, and Equation (6) is the equation of the
plane. If the matrix m’ satisfies these conditions, then it lies on a circle formed by intersection of the
surface of the balloon (Equation 5) by the plane (Equation 6). The matrix m is considered as a point in
space 20xn, from which the nearest point was obtained, which lies on the circle formed by the
intersection of the surface plane with the ball. The coordinates of this point are the m’ matrix. It is easy
to write a few simple equations to determine the coordinates of this point (the values of the matrix m’)
on base of the matrix m, using Equations 5 and 6 (Pugacheva V.M. et al. 2016). Practically, this means
that the constants A, B, and the matrix m can be used to calculate the p(i) for a sequence S, thus the
matrix m’ can be clearly defined (if there is an intersection of the surface of the plane with the ball
plane). Further, the aim was to find for each matrix length equal n the constant B, which would ensure
a maximum identity of the distribution function of maxF on the set of sequences Q.

Simultaneously, with the calculation of the distribution function for maxF on the set of sequences
Q, the average length of a random alignment was calculated as the difference (im-i0), where im - is
coordinate of the maxF in the sequence S, and i0 - coordinate, where F=0.0 (the coordinate of the
beginning of the alignment in the sequence S). The average length of a random alignment equal to
600±60 symbols was selected. This value provides the best search of the alignment boundaries relative
to the real boundaries on the model sequences. The choice of the constant B was carried out by an
iterative procedure. The constant B, which gives l approximately equal to 600 symbols, obviously lies
in the interval from B1=0 and B2=-15.0. There were no registered matrices that failed to satisfy this

l is more than 600, then B1 equal to -7.5 was
taken, and if l is less than 600, B2 equal to -7.5 was taken and the determination of the l was
repeated. When l was equal to 600±60, the process of choosing constant B was stopped.
requirement, thus, the middle of this range was taken. If

2.5 Optimization of a random matrix with the largest value of the
similarity function
For all matrices from the set W, was determined the modified matrix max(m') which had the
highest value of the similarity function maxF. For it, the alignment was calculated and the coordinates
of the alignment were determined (Figure 1, paragraph 5). However, despite the fact that a very large
number of matrices was used, the matrix max(m') may have the value maxF, which is not the largest
for a sequence S and for length of period n. This means that the largest value can be achieved for the
matrix T, which lies at some distance from the matrix max(m') that is less than the chosen threshold L
(paragraph 2.3). Therefore, approximately 10 7 matrices were created, having distance from the matrix
max(m') L less than that specified in paragraph 2.3 (L=1.0) but greater than 0.0. This means that the
difference L with max(m') matrix was in the range (0.0 - 1.0). These matrices were also used, as
indicated in paragraph 2 and a final matrix T was chosen which had the highest value maxF.

2.6 Calculation of Z values for the period n of the studied sequence
The procedures described in paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 were used for random sequences from the
set Q. This allowed the mean value maxF for each length to be determined and the variance
D(maxF) for the maxF after optimization (see paragraph 2.5). This allowed the measure of periodicity
to take the value:
maxF ( n)  maxF ( n)
(7)
D( maxF ( n)) 0.5
As a result, the dependence Z(n) for some symbolic sequences S (Figure 1, paragraphs 6-9) was
constructed. For study, we took the numerical sequence of the Euro/US$ rate. The candle opening and
closing was separated by an interval of 1, 0.5 and 4 h. Let x1(i) - be the rate at the time of opening of
the candle, and x2(i)- the rate at the close of the candle. At the first sequence A1, we calculated the
difference a(i)=x2(i)-x1(i), where x1(i) and x2(i) are separated by a 1 h. The beginning of the candle
falls on the start of each hour and the end of the candle at finish of each hour. The sequence A1 was
obtained from 14.08.2015 to 07.04.2016 and contained 3930 numbers (a(i), i=1,...,3930). We used all
days of the week except Saturday and Sunday. These days the trade is not made or the volume of trade
is very low. Then, this sequence was translated into a symbolic form, as described in paragraph 2.1,
and the sequence S 1 was obtained. The encoding is shown in Table 1.
At the sequences A2, and A3 the difference s(i)=x2(i)-x1(i), was calculated, where x1(i) and x2(i)
are separated by half of hour and 4 hours. This means that the beginning of the candle occurs at the
beginning of each half hour and 4 hours, and the end of the candle is the end of each half hour and 4

hours. The sequence A2 was obtained for data from 05.12.2015 to 07.04.2016 and it contained 4027
numbers. The sequence A3 was obtained for data from 25.09.2015 to 07.04.2016 and it contained 3991
numbers. After translation of these sequences in the symbolic sequences, the sequence S2 and S3 were
obtained and the encoding is shown supplement. We used all days of the week except Saturday and
Sunday also. Numerical data were taken from the Meta Trader 4 Alfa-Forex client terminal, site
http://www.alfa-forex.ru. These data can be received from http://www.finam.ru also.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure. 2 shows the application of the developed approach to the random sequence and the
sequence S 4 obtained from the sequence S4’= (EFKLWNMSTWRYLQKLWQSMETMQ)16.

Figure 2. Black circles show the Z(n) for
the random sequence. White circles show the
Z(n) for the artificial sequence with a period of
24 symbols with total length of 384 symbols
and 75% random substitutions. It is evident
that despite the large number of random
substitutions, the developed mathematical
method could detect the periodicity with n=24.

Figure 3. The spectrum of Z(n) obtained
for the sequence S1 (paragraph 2.6).

Randomly, 75% substitutions were done in the sequence S4’, after which our developed approach
was applied. The results of the analysis of random sequences show that Z(n) fluctuated around 4.0.
Noticeable, a small trend toward increasing values of Z for the random sequence is only for lengths of
periods of more than 70. From these results, it can be concluded that the periods with Z-values>7.0
were found to be interesting.
The results of the study of sequence S4 show that the developed approach was able to identify
fuzzy frequency and determine the optimal weighting matrix for the detection of periodicity with
length equal to 24 symbols. It is possible to see periodicity equal to 48 and 72 symbols. However,
large values of Z also received periods with lengths close to 48 and 72 symbols, because there is the
possibility of insertions or deletions.
It is always possible to do insertions, or deletions to align the sequence S4 against the matrices and
to receive periodicity near to 48 to 72 symbols with high Z. However, this leads to a slight drop in the
values of Z, which is related to the penalties for insertions or deletions. So the graph around 48 and 72
symbols, looks like a gently sloping mountain. Next, the developed approach was applied to the
periodicity search for the symbolic sequence S 1 (paragraph 2.6). The spectrum of Z(n) obtained for the
sequence S 1 is shown in Figure. 3. From this figure, it can be seen that the sequence S1 has two
periods. The first period equals 24 hours and has the largest value of Z from 341 to 3533, the hours of
7

the sequence S1. 39 insertions and deletions were made to find this period. The second period has a
length equal to 23 hours and has the largest value of Z from 1044 to 3478 hours. The period equal to
24 h is the most statistically expressed (Z | 10.3) compared to the period having length of 23 h (Z |
8.1). It can be assumed that building a significant alignment for two periods is associated with the
ability to create insertions or deletions of the symbols in the sequence S 1.

the sequence S 3. This period was observed for the
13 to 3787 numbers of the sequence S3.

Figure 4. The spectrum of Z(n) obtained for the
sequence S 2

The Figure 4 shows Z(n) for the sequence S 2. For the sequence S 2, periodicity was observed for
n=48 which corresponds to 24 h also. This period was observed for the 970 to 3893 numbers of the
sequence S 2. 44 insertions and deletions were made to find this period. The periodicity of sequence S3
is shown in Fig.5. It is possible to see the periods for n=6, 12, 18, 24 and 30. It corresponds to 24, 48,
72, 96 and 120 hours. The period equal to 96 h is the most statistically expressed (Z | 11.5). These
results demonstrate that the periodicity equal to 24 hours can be seen for different candles (half hour,
one hour and four hours). It is also seen that there is a little period equal to 4 days apart from a period
of 24 hours since Z(24)> Z(6).
We specifically excluded Saturday and Sunday from consideration. It permits to eliminate periods
that are associated with small changes in exchange rates in these days compared to other days of the
week. We have done analysis taking into account Saturday and Sunday. All our results have been
saved without major changes.
The question arises about the nature of the periodicity discovered in this work. The different
periodic processes influence currency exchange rates. Man himself has inherent rhythms of different
frequencies; for example, Halberg (Halberg 1969) classified the biological rhythms of humans
according to the period length. He identified several groups of rhythms: 1. Low frequency group has
periods from 4 days to 12 months; 2. Mid-range group has period from 20 to 72 h; 3. High frequency
area has period less than 20 h. It can therefore be assumed that the observed periodicity of the
exchange rate at 24 h, reflects the influence of mid-frequency rhythms on the exchange rate. Periods
equal to 24 and 25 hours can be caused by the daily rotation of the earth (Chizhevsky 1976).
An attempt was made to find the periodicity for the sequence s(i)=x2(i)-x1(i),, where x1(i) ɢ x2(i) are
separated by minutes in the interval n from 1 to 5 min. No statistically significant periodicity was
found in a given interval, for a "minute" of the sequence. Sequences S1, S 2 and S 3 were also built for
other time intervals with the same length. In these cases, the Z(n) and behavior of the phase shifts were
similar.

The detected frequency was associated with many other exchange rates and stock prices (e.g.
Microsoft shares) and indices (e.g. NASDAG). The only exception was the Russian ruble to the US$
and the Euro. This may be due to the fact that the ruble is not a real market currency.
It was also interesting to explain the presence of insertions or deletions of symbols (it was
impossible to find frequency without it) and the behavior of the phase shift for the periodicity of 24 h.
Probably, there is great instability in the behavior of large human masses and this instability may
create phase shifts with insertions or deletions. Also, it can be assumed that some events of public life
may be the cause of phase shifts, insertions, or deletions. For a more accurate consideration of this
issue, a separate study is required. The correlations between the phase shifts, insertions and deletions
in the sequences S 1, S2 and S3 should be searched and the events of public life and other factors, are of
both social and physical nature. In the future, we want to develop a data bank of periods observed in
financial time series. We think that these results can be the basis for the development of a new
computer system for predicting of exchange rates.
