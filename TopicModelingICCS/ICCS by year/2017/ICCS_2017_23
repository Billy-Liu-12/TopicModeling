Beside the description of the network, different implemented features as e.g. “cue validity factor”
(cvf), which is used to steer the clusters according to the interests, and the polygon feature selection,
allowing the definition of reference types with respect to the analysis, are first discussed. Subsequently
the used medical data are shortly presented and results depending on the cvf are shown in a “mapvisualization”. Finally, the validation of the reference types and additional possibilities of analysis
with SEN are shortly discussed.
The objective of this article is to demonstrate how complex medical data can be analyzed without
extensive pre-preparation by
a) steering the clustering through a cue validity factor,
b) mark the data which should be excluded from the analysis and / or to be selected for the definition
as reference types,
c) validation of the reference types with additional data.

2 The Self-Enforcing Network (SEN)
The SEN is a type of self-organized learning neural networks, developed by our Research Group
"Computer Based Analysis of Social Complexity" (CoBASC). “Self-organized learning” means that
the network does not get any explicitly given learning goal, but has to structure the input given to it
according to an internal learning logic (cf. e.g. Klüver, 2016a). SEN can be understood as a twolayered network with a feed-forward topology by considering the attributes (case information) as input
neurons and the objects as output neurons (case ID).
The chief function of the SEN is the classifying of data sets, which are represented in a “semantical
matrix”; in this article the values of the semantical matrix are the real data imported from csv-files,
using the min-max normalization, accordingly adjusted for the SEN with the interval [-1.0 – 1.0].
The operations of a SEN start by analyzing the values of the semantical matrix and by transforming
the attribute values a of the associated objects o into the weight matrix wao of the network. The weight
matrix wao, hence, is generated from the semantical matrix and not randomly.
The learning rule of a SEN that changes the values of the weight matrix is:
𝑤𝑤 𝑡𝑡 + 1 = 𝑤𝑤 𝑡𝑡 + ∆𝑤𝑤 , 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
∆𝑤𝑤 = 𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑤𝑤!"

(1)

c is a constant defined as 0 ≤ c ≤ 1.
The cue validity is a measure how important certain attributes are for membership in a given
category (Rosch and Mervis, 1975).
By using cvf-values it is possible to distinguish between the degrees of importance of an attribute
for the analysis. If the value of the cvf = 1 or higher, the attribute is most important; if cvf = 0 than the
attribute is not considered for the training and in consequence not for clustering.
The equation (1) then becomes
∆𝑤𝑤 = 𝑐𝑐 ∗ 𝑤𝑤!" ∗ 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐! .

(2)

In this analysis the linear-mean value function (LMF) is used as activation function:
𝑎𝑎! =

𝑎𝑎! ∗ 𝑤𝑤!"
,	
𝑘𝑘

(3)	

with k = number of connections, aj is the activation value of the receiving neuron j, ai the value of
the sending neuron i, and wij the according weight value.
The results of a SEN system are visualized in different ways to allow a fast interpretation. In this

article the “map visualization” is used (Klüver, 2016b), representing the approximated similarity
between the objects.
After the learning process is finished, a user can insert a so-called input vector containing the
different attributes, in the context of this article new medical data.
If the map visualization of the trained network allows the detection of clusters, polygon features
select the objects within one cluster. Then the mean value is calculated for each attribute of the
selected objects. The calculated vector is defined as “reference type” for the according cluster as
follows:
1
𝑟𝑟! =
𝑛𝑛

!
!!!

𝑎𝑎!" 	

(4)

rj is the value of the reference type for the attribute j, n the number of vectors within the polygon,
and aij the activation value of the attribute j of the vector i.
In addition the marked objects can be exported to a csv-file or transformed into "input-vectors".

3 Selected Data and Analysis
Typically, medical data have not only a big volume; they are also very complex, containing
different types of numerical data and text components, which have to be pre-prepared for a suited
algorithm.
Real anonymized clinical data, obtained from the University Hospital Essen are analyzed, which
contain information as "Diagnosis-related group" (DRG), a system to classify hospital cases, cost
factors, "Patient Clinical Complexity Level" (PCCL) with the levels 0 – 4, describing no comorbidity
and/or complication (0) to extremely severe comorbidity and/or complication (4), stay at the hospital
and additional information as gender and other medical records. In total about 65.000 data are at
disposal from the year 2015. Each record has in total 16 columns containing numerical values and text
description; the latter have not been taken into account. The columns containing e.g. diagnosis
according to ICD-101, having numerical values and character combination were transformed in only
numerical values.
For the building of reference types with SEN only 1.000 records were selected for the learning
process; the objects are case ID made anonymous, which have the advantage that the results of
clustering can be easily checked in the semantical matrix e.g. if there are outliers. The cue validity
factor (cvf) is for all attributes 1.0, meaning that all attributes have the same relevance, the activation
function is the linear-mean value (LMF), and c = 0.1, which is constant for all further experiments.
Fig. 1 shows the first result: two main clusters can be clearly identified by the gender (on top: male,
down: female) and some outliers can be observed. In addition there is an indication that the patients
are clustered according to the PCCL (on the left side with PCCL 0 and on the right side with PCCL 4),
which is the same pattern for both main clusters.
The outliers, who should be not included for the building of reference types, are selected by
polygon marks. These data contain large ranges of e.g. the age (0 for premature infant and 91), stay in
hospital (1 day to 585 days), the main diagnosis (A40.2 – Z09.88), and the cost weight (0.225 to
100.315).

Figure 1: SEN result trained with all attributes with a cvf = 1.0 with marked outliners

It seems obvious to steer the clusters in accordance with the gender and PCCL. To have a variation,
different cue validity values are introduced for the definition of reference types: 0.5 for gender and
PCCL, 0.2 for DRG and for all the others attributes a value of 0.1, because these attributes extreme
vary in the range of the values. The reference types are defined and constructed as the centers of the
according data clusters. To make sure that the learned and now averaged data are correctly assigned to
the reference types, only the reference types remain in the semantical matrix and are trained by SEN,
and the initial 1.000 records are inserted as input vectors. The influence of the cvf can be seen in the
following Figure 2:

Figure 2: Result of the SEN and marked clusters, which are selected to build reference types (left side).
Assignment of the initial 1.000 records (black color) to the obtained reference types (right side).

As can be seen the marked clusters do not include outliers to avoid a large range of the attributes;
these should be preserved for additional analysis. SEN subsequently classifies the data according to
the cvf; the ten obtained reference types are clearly divided by the gender and PCCL-levels (0 – 4).
The first validation was to insert 10.000 new input vectors (case ID) with the same cv-values as for
the definition of the reference types. The result is shown in Figure 3:

Figure 5: Results of the assignment of the 10.000 new case IDs

The new input vectors are clearly assigned to the reference types. These are inserted into the
respective clusters according to their similarities to the reference types, i.e. their distances.

4 Conclusion and further work
The variation of the cvf for every attribute and with different values allows simplifying the process
of clustering and the analysis of the data. The advantage of building reference types from the original
data enables to analyze large data by inserting the data as input vectors. The results show if the
reference types are well defined or if there is the necessity to adjust them according to new data. SEN
enables all these possibilities without any major effort.
In general SEN can be used for the detection of e.g. voice over IP attacks or fraudulent behavior,
defining the according reference type from collected data. Because of the first promising results, the
reference types should be defined automatically as well as the streaming of new input data.
