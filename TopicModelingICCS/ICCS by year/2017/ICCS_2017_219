unconditionally stable, has a second-order approximation in all the variables, and is cheap to
implement (Skiba and Filatov, 2007, 2008, 2011). Three practically important blow-up regimes with a
rapid growth of the solution over a finite time were successfully simulated: the HS-regime with the
solution increasing in an expanding domain, the LS-regime with the solution growing in a shrinking
domain and the S-regime with the solution growing in a fixed-size domain.

2 Nonlinear Diffusion Model
We consider the 3D nonlinear diffusion equation in the spherical shell written in the coordinates 
(the radius),  (the longitude),  (the latitude)

(2)

Here ~ is the diffusion coefficient, while  is the external forcing. Using the standard method
of operator splitting, we define the grid spacing in time as  =  âˆ’  and in every double time
interval  ,   linearise (1) and then split the linearised equation by coordinates, assuming
~   and   = , ,  . The split equations are to be solved in time successively: the
solution to the radial subproblem (i.e. solved in  ) is the initial condition for the longitudinal
subproblem; that, in turn, after being solved in , will provide the initial condition for the latitudinal
subproblem; the latter, solved in , will supply the initial condition for the forcing equation. Next, in
order to reach the approximation order (  ), the bicyclic splitting procedure is used (Marchuk, 1982)
when the order of the splitting changes to the inverse one in  ,   (see formulas (5)-(7) below).

Because the metric term  cos  vanishes at  = Â± , the spherical operators  and  are

meaningless at the poles. Therefore, for approximating the entire sphere , under âˆ† =  âˆ’  and
âˆ† =  âˆ’  we define on  a grid making a half step shift in  as

(3)

Due to the shift in  we exclude the pole singularities, so that the resulting finite difference equations
will have sense everywhere on   . For subsequent computing in the longitude one may, evidently,
use the periodic boundary condition, as the sphere  is a periodic domain in . As for computing in the
latitude, the point is that the sphere is not a periodic domain in . Several approaches can be used to
solve the latitudinal subproblem, e.g. one could involve a matrix bordering procedure or try to paste
the solution from the opposite meridians at the poles. A disadvantage of these techniques is that in the
case of an implicit temporal approximation the resulting matrix will be of a general type and so no fast
algorithms of linear algebra can be used for computing the solution. Alternatively, an explicit temporal
discretisation can be used, but the requirement of the stability will impose serious restrictions on the
time step, especially when 	 is large. The method of splitting used in this work allows avoiding all
these problems. Due to the splitting, for computing the solution in  we change the coordinate map
from (3) to

Obviously, grid (4) contains the same nodes as (3). The use of the two coordinate maps   and  
allows employing the numerical algorithm with the periodic boundary conditions in both directions,

3 Numerical Tests
In Figure 1 we simulate a nonlinear diffusion phenomenon called temperature waves. Here

maximum value of ï¿½ does not change, i.e. the wave front is of constant value.

This problem simulates the phenomenon of temperature waves with a constant front

In Figure 2 we provide the initial and final solutions of equation (1) for a more sophisticated caseâ€“
the phenomenon of combustion (Samarskii et al., 1995). There are three different modes of
combustion depending on the parameter ï¿½ that introduces a nonlinearity into the sources ï¿½~ï¿½ : the
case ï¿½ < ï¿½ + 1 corresponds to the so-called HS-regimeâ€“the area of combustion is getting expanded
while burning; the case ï¿½ > ï¿½ + 1 corresponds to the LS-regimeâ€“the area of combustion is getting
narrower; the case ï¿½ = ï¿½ + 1 corresponds to the constant area of burning (S-regime). In all the cases

the nonlinear feedback due to the sources leads to an infinite increase of the temperature  over time,
that is a blow-up occurs (Samarskii et al., 1995).

In Figure 3 we show a yet another phenomenonâ€“the spherical travelling waves. These are
modelled by the diffusion equation with a specially chosen right-hand side function . Specifically,
the sinusoid begins travelling clockwise at the low latitudes and near the poles, while at the
intermediate latitudes it goes anticlockwise. After some time the process alters, and the rotation in the

opposite direction takes place (not shown). This phenomenon evinces the interaction between the
nonlinearity, external forcing and dissipation, which generates solutions with periodic breakups and
renewals of complex structures via the self-organisation process.

4 Conclusion
We are interested in unbounded solutions (blow-up regimes) of the 3D nonlinear diffusion problems
with a nonlinear forcing, which appear due to a strong positive nonlinear feedback. An efficient noniterative implicit numerical method for the solution of these problems is developed. The method is
based on the coordinate splitting, is unconditionally stable, has a second-order approximation in all the
variables, and is cheap to implement. Three practically important blow-up regimes characterized by
unlimited growth of the solution in finite time were successfully simulated: in the HS-regime the
solution grows in an expanding domain, in the LS-regime it grows in a shrinking domain, and in the Sregime the growth takes place in a fixed-size area. Our method can be applied for simulating
extremely growing solutions in rapid compression and accumulation of matter (laser fusion), chemical
kinetics, magnetohydrodynamics, meteorology (tornadoes and lightnings), ecology (growth and
extinction of biological populations), neurophysiology, epidemiology (infectious disease outbreaks),
economics (rapid economic growth), demography (world population growth)â€“just to name a few.
