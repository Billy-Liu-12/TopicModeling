continuous in the relevant topologies in P and U .
Input data to Inverse Parametric Problems (IPP) constitutes observations of the forward
solutions, so that the following mapping can be established
A2 : U  u → u ∈ O,

(3)

where O is a space of observations, typically a finite dimensional subspace of U . Again, A2 is
frequently continuous, as a kind of linear projection. Let us denote A = A2 ◦ A1 : P → O and
assume to be continuous in the appropriate topologies. An abstract IPP, inverse to (1) can be
defined as follows:
(4)
Given u0 ∈ O, find ω ∈ P; A(ω) = u0 .
No matter how (4) will be solved numerically, this abstract formulation is convenient for the
IPP taxonomy.
The state-of-the-art literature classifies the problem (4) as well posed in the sense of
Hadamard, if it possesses a unique, stable solution, It is satisfied if A is one-to-one and A−1 is
continuous (see e.g. [9]). Other problems are generally called ill-posed or ill-conditioned.
Additionally, one can distinguish among the ill-posed problems a class of inverse problems
conditionally well-posed in the sense of Tikhonow. Roughly speaking, an inverse problem belongs to this class, if there exists a set M ⊂ P, so that u0 ∈ A(M ) and:
1. A(ω) = u has a unique solution for all u ∈ A(M ),

2. A−1 is continuous on A(M ).

The set M is called the set of well posedness of the inverse problem (4), (see definitions 4.3
and 4.4 in [9]). The above conditions restrict the applicability of the most popular method of
solving ill-posed IPPs, namely regularization, which “smoothes” the operator A−1 in a step-wise
manner, to finally reach a global continuity (see e.g. [14]).
However, there are a lot of IPPs in the real world which are not conditionally well-posed
in the sense of Tikhonov, and thus hardly solvable by the regularization method. Examples
include nondestructive testing, tumor tissue diagnosis and oil resources investigations. We may
distinct several causes for which the conditional well posedness may be questionable:
(i) The mathematical model sometimes allows multiple solutions (see e.g. [2]). As a consequence, the operator A1 is not an injection. Moreover A1 is rarely given explicitly, as in
the case of a problem inverse to (1).
(ii) Typically, the observation operator A2 is not an injection, as a projection of an infinite
dimensional space onto a finite dimensional one, i.e. the measurement, rarely delivers the
complete information allowing to reconstruct the forward solution.
(iii) As a consequence of the above two causes, A is rarely an injection and then IPPs allow
multiple solutions.
The drawbacks discussed above exhibit the necessity of a quite other way of classifying and
solving IPPs, which do not undergo regularization.
Definition 1. An inverse parametric problem, which is not conditionally well-posed in the sense
of Tikhonov and cannot be successfully solved by regularization is called irremediable.

We propose a new taxonomy which includes the irremediable ill-posed inverse problems on
the base of their popular formulation as the global optimization ones:
arg minω∈P {f (u0 , uω ); A1 (ω) = uω },

(5)

where f : O × U → R+ ∪ {0} is a misfit functional expressing the gap between an observation
and a simulated solution. In the simplest case f (u0 , u) = u0 − A2 (u)2O and when O ⊂ U we
may immediately set f (u0 , u) = u0 − u2U . Let us consider a nonempty set of solutions S ⊂ P
to the problem (5) for a given observation u0 ∈ O.
C1. The problem (5) is unimodal if card(S) = 1.
C2. The problem (5) is multimodal if card(S) > 1.
C3. The solution ω ∈ S is sensitive and stable on an open, connected set B ⊂ P with a positive

for some sufficiently large constant g > 0.
C5. The solution ω ∈ S is γn-insensitive on an open, connected set B ⊂ P, meas(B) > 0, if
ω ∈ B and
∃n ∈ P; nP = 1;

∀α = 0, x = ω + αn ∈ B,

ω ∈ B and w is γn-insensitive on the set B, ∀n ∈ P; nP = 1.
C7. The set of solutions A ⊆ S to the problem (5) is γ-insensitive, if there exist disjoint,
connected sets B1 , . . . , Bp ⊂ P, p ≥ 1, such that meas(Bi ) > 0, i = 1, . . . , p and ∀ω ∈ A
∃i ∈ {1, . . . , p} so, that ω is γ-insensitive on the set Bi .
C8. The problem (5) is γ-unspecified, if there exists a set A ⊆ S of γ-insensitive solutions, so
that meas(A) > 0.
C9. The problem (5) is γ-unspecified, multimodal, if it is γ-unspecified and p > 1.

Complex Memetic Approach

We propose a strategy, which is fitted to deal with γ-unspecified, multimodal problems defined
in the introductory part. It is an extension of Hierarchic Memetic Strategy (HMS) (put forward
by Smołka [13]).
HMS is a multi-deme (or multi-population) optimization strategy. It operates on a tree of
demes of set depth, where each level is characterized, among others, by a calculation accuracy —
the closer to the leaves, the higher the accuracy. Especially for parametric inverse problems, for
which fitness computation is expensive but can be controlled with the accuracy, such approach
yields solution much more efficiently than other state-of-the-art solutions [13].
The hp-adaptive Finite Element Method [4] allows for controlling the numerical error and
computational cost of solving forward problem (1), according to the accuracy applied at the
particular HMS tree level, if the mapping f (u0 , A1 (ω)) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to
the unknown parameter ω ∈ P, see e.g. [12]. Such strategy decreases significantly the total
computational cost by reducing the accuracy of forward solutions used for misfit evaluations by
the root- and branch-demes of the HMS tree and by using the target, maximum accuracy only
for leaf-demes, containing the small fraction of all HMS individuals.
In the newly proposed approach, we only use HMS as the first, global, stage of processing.
For now, we restrict it to a two-level deme-tree, from which we collect the individuals appearing in the leaf-demes’ history. Next, the collected individuals are clustered using OPTICS-ξ
algorithm, provided by ELKI Data Mining Framework [10]. The resulting clusters are then
combined, if they are found to lie in the same basin of attraction, we do it by the means of
using hill-valley function (described in [15]) and local optimization.
Then, agents called Local Basin Agents (LBAs) are created, which raise local diversity of the
combined clusters. It is done with Multiwinner Selection (MWS) algorithm, which is improved
compared to the version from [6]. After the local diversity of the samples is increased, they are
handed over to the local approximation algorithm.

2.1

Genetic Algorithm with Multiwinner Selection

Multiwinner selection. An election consists of a set of candidates and a set of voters. Each
voter has a linear order over the candidate set, from the most to the least favorable candidate,
called preference order. A multiwinner rule, when given an election and k, the number of
winners, returns a subset of the set of candidates of size k. From a number of rules, we have
selected GreedyCC, based on the analysis in [6].
MWS operator receives an election group X = {x(1) , . . . , x(n) } of individuals, each with its
fitness value f (x(i) ). The candidate and the voter sets are equal to X. It is then necessary to
obtain the preference order of each individual. We use so called proportional utility functions
for each voter i based on the distance between the voter i and a candidate j, and the fitness
value of j
h(f (x(j) ))
,
(6)
upi (x(j) ) =
1 + d(x(i) , x(j) )
where h(x) = 1/1+x is a reversal function (required to transform the fitness values of a minimization problem) and d is the Euclidean distance. It guarantees that on one hand, individuals
prefer other similar, i.e. close, individuals while taking into account the fitness information. In
such setting, when GreedyCC rule is applied it returns a well distributed result.
For a complete description of the multiwinner elections, please refer to [6]. We provide only
the backbone of its mechanics here.

Sampling the consecutive epoch populations. We then use MWS in a modified Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which promotes local diversity in its population. It uses the (µ + λ) scheme,
i.e. next population consists of both parents and children, which individuals survive is determined with MWS. We start with producing the λ offspring individuals using normal mutation
only (no crossover). The children population is of the same size as the parental one, i.e. λ = µ.
Next, the union of parents and children is reduced by MWS yielding µ individuals, which will
constitute the next population.

2.2

Local Approximation

Our main objective is to build a local approximation of each set B ⊂ P at which misfit is γunspecified (see condition C8), which in our tests we assume to be determined by the level set of
the misfit function f . In order to compute it, we need an efficient way to compute approximate
values of the misfit. Since in many problems the misfit is continuously differentiable, we want
such approximation to preserve this property [5, 11].
Populations generated by the genetic algorithm provide us with exact values of the misfit and
its gradient at certain points x ∈ P. Let Q denote the minimal hypercube containing B with
edges parallel to the coordinate axes. In the first step we build the Delaunay triangulation on B


 ∈ C 0 (Q) d
and use it to construct Lagrange interpolations f ∈ C 0 (Q) of the misfit f and Df
of its gradient Df .
The above approximation has two defects: it is not C 1 , and it does not use the available
gradient information. In this paper we discuss two approaches: the first one addresses the
first issue, the second one addresses both at the price of a higher computational cost. Both
approaches are based on approximating misfit with B-splines.
L2 -projection approach. Let B denote a tensor product B-spline basis defined on Q (see [1]
for a detailed exposition) and V be the space spanned by B. The first proposed approach consists
in computing an L2 -projection of Lagrange interpolant f onto V, i.e. computing f¯ ∈ V such
that the approximation error f − f¯L2 (Q) is minimal. It is well known that such f¯ is a unique
element of V such that f − f¯ is orthogonal to V [7, Theorem 5.24]. For a finite-dimensional
space V this condition can be expressed as a system of linear equations with Gram matrix of
the basis B. Thanks to the tensor product construction of the basis such Gram matrix has
tensor product structure as well, and so the system can be efficiently solved in linear time using
the ADS algorithm [8].
Since B-splines are continuously differentiable, V ⊂ C 1 (Q) and so such approximation is C 1 .

Nevertheless, the same calculations can be carried out as in the case of the L -projection and

product structure and the ADS algorithm cannot be applied. To the best of authors’ knowledge,
no linear time solver exists for such systems.

Approximation Error Discussion

Our approximation method uses the Lagrange interpolation based on a finite element mesh,
hence it is natural to derive the estimates from the classical fact from the finite element interpolation theory [3, Theorem 3.2.1]. Given v ∈ H k+1 (Ω), if ΠL v is a Lagrange interpolant of v
on a regular mesh then there exists a constant CL such that
v − ΠL vH 1 (Ω) ≤ CL hkL |v|H k+1 (Ω) ,


2
where |v|H k (Ω) = |α|=k+1 Dα v2L2 (Ω) is a standard seminorm on H k (Ω) and hL is the maximal mesh element diameter. An analogous inequality holds for the L2 norm error with hkL
replaced by hk+1
L .
Similar inequalities can be established for the isogeometric L2 projection operator Πiso ([1,
Lemma 3.3]): there exists a constant Ciso such that for 0 ≤ k ≤ p, where p is the order of used
B-spline basis, and v ∈ H k+1 we have
v − Πiso vH 1 (Ω) ≤ Ciso hkQ |v|H k+1 (Ω)

where hQ is the maximal diameter of the B-spline mesh. As for the Lagrange interpolation,
analogous estimate holds for L2 norm with hkQ replaced by hk+1
Q .
Combining the above inequalities we can estimate the total approximation error of the first
approach using the triangle inequality
v − Πiso ΠL vH 1 (Ω) ≤ v − ΠL vH 1 (Ω) + ΠL v − Πiso ΠL vH 1 (Ω)
≤ CL hkL |v|H k+1 (Ω) + Ciso hkQ |ΠL v|H k+1 (Ω)

k+1
Analogous estimate for L2 norm can be obtained replacing both hkL , hkQ with hk+1
respecL , hQ
tively. The bounds hold for any 0 ≤ k ≤ p and v ∈ H k+1 (Ω).

Benchmark

We wanted to see how the algorithm will perform when faced with a benchmark problem with
a non-convex plateau region. In particular, we want to assess how well can it approximate the
plateau shape. We introduce the benchmark function with a plateau first. Then we proceed to
the analysis of the results, which is split into two parts: first we assess the LBA phase and only
then the local approximation.
We define the benchmark fitness function as follows. It is a two-dimensional product of two
perpendicular reflected Gaussian functions. Each function is defined as


(r ,r )
g(x10 ,x20 ) (x1 , x2 ) = 1 − exp −ln 2/r12 (x1 − x01 )2 − ln 2/r22 (x2 − x02 )2 ,
(7)

where ri define the axes of an ellipse centered at x0 = (x01 , x02 ) at which the function g takes the
value of 1/2. The function value is 0 at x0 and approaches 1 quickly as the distance increases.
We then combine two such functions
(5,0.5)

(0.5,5)

p(x1 , x2 ) = g(0,0) (x1 , x2 ) · g(0,0) (x1 , x2 ) ,

(8)

which form a cross-like valley and we slice it from below at the value of 1/2, scaling its values
back to the range [0, 1], i.e.

2p(x1 , x2 ) − 1 if p(x1 , x2 ) ≥ 1/2 ,

Figure 1: The objective function of the benchmark is shown on the left. On the right, an
example combined sample from LBA is shown, with the axes zoomed in on the plateau. The
isoline is placed at 0.1 fitness value, marking an edge of the plateau.
In such way, we obtain a fitness function with a cross-shaped plateau region, as presented on
the left of Figure 1.
The global phase of the strategy was done with a 2-level HMS algorithm. On the root level,
a 20-individual population was used with 0.05 chance of crossover and 0.5 chance of mutation
(with standard deviation of 2) and on the leaf level the population size was 5 with 0.5 crossover
chance and 0.1 mutation chance (with standard deviation of 0.1). Sprouts from the root to the
leaf level were allowed for objective values better than 0.1 and the minimal distance to other
leaves was 1. The global stopping condition was a budget of 500 fitness evaluations, that is
when the calculation was stopped forcefully. Moreover, each leaf was terminated if its average
fitness value didn’t improve in an epoch. The combined sample of individuals from the leaves
constituted the input to the next phase.
In the local phase, the points were first clustered with OPTICS-ξ, εm = 10, MinPts = 10 and
ξ = 0.02. The cluster hierarchy reducer was constructed to accept at least clusters of 10 points.
The consolidator used 3 intermediate points, hill-valley tolerance of 0.1 without a distance
restriction. Resulting LBA agents had populations of 100 individuals. MWS used only mutation
(without crossover) with standard deviation of 0.5. The calculations were stopped after 4
epochs, and the results from the 3 last epochs were then forwarded to the local approximation.
An example result in form of a combined-epochs sample is presented on the right of Figure 1.
To assess the performance of the strategy up to local approximation phase, we have used
the notion of “plateau coverage”, a method of measuring how well the points cover a plateau.
Plateau is assumed to be a region where fitness values are below 0.1. A rectangular grid is
imposed on the region, and for each grid-point it is checked if any point from the sample lies
at most 0.5 far from it — if so, the grid-point is covered. Calculating the ratio of the covered
grid-points to the total number of grid-points one arrives at the coverage value for the sample.
We have run the strategy 20 times and calculated the plateau coverage for each run by
combining all the populations (excluding the first) from the LBAs. The coverage value was
0.84 ± 0.12 (at 1-σ confidence level) with a minimum at 0.40 and a maximum at 0.97. The
minimal value was a highly unlikely event of all the demes being sprouted on the far edges of
one Gaussian function (test no. 11), the second worst was 0.74 of coverage.

Moreover, we have compared the results of the global phase to the local one. The first
global phase only managed to achieve the coverage of 0.63 ± 0.090 (at 1-σ confidence level),
being significantly less efficient than the following phase.
The final step is to construct a local approximation of misfit and use it to estimate the
shape of the set at which the misfit is γ-unspecified (plateau). We used B-spline functions of
order 2, mesh of 40 × 40 elements and both approaches described in Section 2.2. From the 20
runs we present three – one with an unfortunate point distribution leading to poor results, one
with a very good distribution and one in between. The approximations are constructed using
population members from all the epochs. For each run and each approximation method we have
computed three error measures: mean L2 and H 1 approximation errors and Hausdorff distance
between the exact plateau and the plateau constructed using the approximation (Table 1).
Results for the first run are presented in Figure 2. The population is strongly concentrated
at the edges of the horizontal part of the plateau and almost no data from other parts of
the domain is available. This results in a poor quality of the local approximations. Both L2
and H 1 -projection based approximations produce inaccurate plateau approximations, since
only the horizontal part can be detected. The estimate produced by H 1 projection consists
only of the regions with high population concentration, while L2 projection manages to stay
accurate enough near the center to produce a connected plateau approximation. Its shape
is highly distorted away from the edges of the plateau, but nevertheless Hausdorff error is
significantly lower for L2 projection than for H 1 projection that produces disconnected plateau
approximation.
Results for the second run are presented in Figure 3. This time the points are distributed
more evenly and most of the plateau is covered (except for the leftmost part and a small region
in the right part). This allows the approximations to be much more accurate – the errors are
significantly lower (except for H 1 error of L2 projection). In particular, Hausdorff distances for
both approximation methods are about two times lower. The shape of the H 1 -projection based
approximation seems smoother and more regular, and so closer to the original misfit function.
This fact is reflected by its lower L2 and H 1 errors. Nevertheless, the plateau approximation
based on H 1 projection is disconnected and generally worse than the one obtained using L2
projection. This is confirmed by Hausdorff error values.
Results for the third run are presented in Figure 4. This time the points are distributed
evenly without significant uncovered regions. The quality of both L2 and H 1 approximations is
higher than in the previous examples, based on approximation errors presented in Table 1. In
this test, H 1 projection yields more accurate plateau approximation. Despite lower approximation errors, the plateau approximation is still worse than the one produced by L2 approximation

in the previous example.
In all of the above examples both L2 and H 1 error metrics favor H 1 -projection based
approximation, but the quality of plateau approximation measured by Hausdorff distance varies
– in the first two examples L2 projection approach produces better plateau estimate. In the
20 conducted experiments, L2 projection gave satisfactory plateau approximation in 10 cases,
while H 1 projection – in 5 cases. Most common errors consist in disconnected plateau (test 7)
and omitting one of the segments (test 11). It may suggest that H 1 -projection, while superior
if enough data is available, is more sensitive to uneven point distribution and lack of data in
some regions.

Conclusion

The paper suggests a new taxonomy of ill-posed parametric inverse problems (4) formulated
as the global optimization ones (5). While conditions C1–C3 correspond in some way to the
conditional well-posedness in the sense of Tikhonov, C5–C9 systematize irremediable problems
unsolvable by the regularization method. The g-unstable problems C4 (needle minimizers) are
most likely artifacts and can be ignored. The taxonomy is computationally-oriented, so the
values of g, c0 , c1 , γ may depend on the accuracy of the solving algorithm and the arithmetic
available. The paper shows also a new way of solving γ-unspecified problems C8, C9 by means
of a complex memetic approach including: genetic computation with adaptive accuracy, random
sample clustering and a sophisticated local approximation of misfit plateau regions.
