due to the recommendation received from the application [3]. In Germany, 6% of participants
indicated that they changed their vote choice to another party [10], while 3% did so in Finland
[11]. In Switzerland, substantial amount of participants stated that the voting recommendation
affected their voting behavior. Around 70% of survey participants indicated that the voting
recommendation influenced their decisions on the ballot, with most of them voting for different
candidates because of the ranking list that they received from the VAA. A smaller but still
substantial part of users indicated that they changed their party choice as a consequence of
the VAA output [4, 6, 5, 1]. Although more studies in this field have to be done, all these
previous studies reflect evidence that VAA’s have a strong influence to persuade changes in
voters’ decisions. This paper is structured as follows: First, Section 2 describes the profile
generation methods. Section 3 presents the different datasets, pre-processing and processing,
and a description of the VAA design. Section 4 provides an analysis and evaluation of the
methodology used for dynamic profile generation. Finally, concluding remarks and outlooks
are presented in Section 5.

Profiling Candidates

This study considers that the pillar of the VAA’s design should be based on a resistant or
resilient candidate profile model that can tolerate the answer or user manipulations in order
to represent the most accurate information, ideas, and political orientation of candidates or
political parties. The definition of a candidate profile model is crucial during elections. It
reflects the political party orientation and their goals as a whole. This section has the aim to
define the different elements that can define a candidate profile and explain the criteria behind
all these characteristics. The work of Terán and Kaskina [13] includes two components of a
profile generation for VAA’s, static and dynamic. Both types of profile components with the
main difference being that the static profile is generated when the voter signs up in the VAA and
includes a fixed definition of preferences, whereas the dynamic profile is generated with other
sources of information such as social media. The authors include the possibility of voters and
candidates to actively participating in the system by providing comments, discussion, content,
etc. Based on all the elements and the context in which a candidate can have a public figure,
this study considers the difference and defines two main parameter categories:
• Static Profiles. These are mainly used on VAA’s and are generated when the voter
subscribes to the system and includes a general overview of his/her preferences. Static
profiles are defined by the administrators and correspond to answers on a number of
questions of political issues (I1 , ..., In ). In this paper, these types of profiles are defined
for a so-called VAA 1.0 (this term refers to the Web 1.0), which includes static profiles
that are the only source of information from users.
• Dynamic Profiles. This type of profile can enhance voters’ participation and improve
profile generation. Unlike VAA’s 1.0, dynamic profiles allow users to become content
generators. The dynamic profile is created on the basis of the activity as well as the
different content types created by the voters via a Web interface. These types of profiles
are defined in this paper for a so-called VAA 2.0 (this term refers to the Web 2.0),
which includes dynamic profiles as an additional source of information from users. The
proposed dynamic profile includes a number of block modules, such as context-awareness
(CA), privacy settings (PS), voter interaction (UI), and sentiment analysis (SA), among
other possible modules depending on the features developed to extend the profiles and

recommendations to users. This work focus on the implementation of SA in dynamic
profiles.
Based on the elections datasets provided by the project PreferenceMatcher 1 for the National
Elections in Ecuador in 2013, it is possible to consider the six main social topic categories given
by the VAA EcuadorVota, which are economy, international policy, national policy, security,
welfare state, and society. It is important to consider that the priority of these categories can
change according to the situation in the country. For instance, a deep economic recession will
give more importance to the economy than to societal issues.

2.1

Vector Profile of Candidates

As mentioned above, the candidate model has two main parameter categories, static and dynamic. In addition, each social category will have a weight assigned in the final candidates’
vector by an importance vector. The social topic categories are mapped into three vectors of 30
elements or dimensions each. The size of the vectors is based on the original surveys provided
by the datasets of PreferenceMatcher, and each dimension is represented by one question. The
expert vector represents the opinions of journalists and political scientists. Afterwards, an average is taken between the static and dynamic elements. Then the weight, which is related to
a current social topic context, is represented by an importance factor vector (α1 , ..., α6 ), that
will determine which dimensions of the vector become more important in a certain period of
time. The importance factor vector of α values has a scale for each value from 0 to 1, where
0 represents low importance and 1 represents high importance and/or relevance. For instance,
an economic crisis during the time of elections, the social topic of Economy should be weighted
with a α1 = 1 with a major importance and perhaps the rest of the social topics (α2 , ..., α6 )
with 0.5. This will make that the tweets from the economy topic will have more influence in
the candidate’s vector. As a first setup in our model analysis, the weight factor α has a default
setup of 1 for all the social topic, thus all of them are considered equally important. In the
subsequent sections, more details are provided in order to understand the construction and uses
of this vector in our analysis.
2.1.1

Static Candidate’s Profile Vector

This vector is provided by EcuadorVota, and it represents the opinion of experts with respect
to the topic categories. In other cases, this vector is provided directly from the candidates who
represent the ideology of the party. Nevertheless, by the analysis and the results shown in the
work of Mancera and Bossard [9], this vector is the most biased among all the different elements
in the model since the political interests play an important role. Therefore the candidate
or expert tries to answer to get the maximum opportunity to earn popularity or influence
the candidate perception, regardless of whether his or her answers or opinions represent the
real ideals or thoughts of the candidate. For this reason, the expert candidate profile is not
considered to be the only source for the profile generation in our analysis.
2.1.2

Dynamic Candidate’s Profile Vector

The dynamic candidate vector is not automatically given by a political party, experts, or candidate. It requires extra pre-processing from the perspective of sentiment analysis. The preliminary dynamic candidate’s vector is the result of a sentiment analysis in a vector of 30

dimensions. The sentiment analysis can be applied not only to one social network, but also
many of them. In this work, the sentiment analysis is based on the postings of candidates given
in the social network Twitter.

3

Datasets

The datasets used in this work include the following: datasets (CVS), dataset codebook, expert
vector, and candidates’ Twitter activity (available in the work of Mancera [8]). The datasets
contain several categories and answers provided by voters (users of VAA). Nevertheless, in
order to clean the dataset, it is necessary to identify the relevant information. The datasets
are structured in two big blocks: the superior questions block (i.e., age, educational level,
vote intention, favorite political party, etc.) and the social topic questions. For analysis and
comparison purposes, the supreme question “vote intention” is considered only from the superior
questions block. The rest of the supreme questions are ignored for this study, but they may
become relevant in the case that more granularities are needed (i.e., perception in different
educational levels). The second reason not to consider a deeper level of granularity in this
work is to avoid increasing the complexity of the sentiment analysis. If more parameters (more
granules) are considered, the same parameters in other different elements will be needed to be
taken into account, adding complexity into the model and eventually the analysis. However,
considering only one supreme question does not compromise the quality and outcome, it will
be shown in further sections that the selected supreme question will be a good reference point
later to observe how other elements affect the voting preferences of the voters. Lastly, the block
with social topic questions is considered entirely for this study. The description of the social
topic questions can be found directly on the Website of EcuadorVota 2 .

3.1

Dataset Pre-Processing

In the case of National Elections in Ecuador 2013, there are no party alliances. The assumption at this point is that each candidate represents the ideologies of their party. Nevertheless,
three candidates in the dataset does not have enough vote intention data, which represents
a problem with the size of the dataset. The following parties and candidates are analyzed
in this work: Rafael Correa (Movimiento Alianza PAIS), Guillermo Lasso (CREO), Lucio
Gutiérrez (Partido Sociedad Patriótica), Mauricio Rodas (SUMA), Alvaro Noboa (PRIAN),
Alberto Acosta (Unidad Plurinacional de las Izquierdas), Norman Wray (Ruptura 25), and
Nelson Zavala (PRE). An important consideration is to analyze the data in terms of completeness, which means to consider the voters who have answered all the questions in the survey.
In order to clean the dataset and remain with a proper set of voters, it is needed to reduce
the dataset size and provide fairness in terms of the amount of voters per candidate due to the
nature of the fuzzy algorithm that will be used later during the evaluation, described in Section
4.3. The dataset reduction is performed in four steps:
• Step 1: The analysis only consider voters who fully answered all 30 issue statements, (i.e.,
any user that had at least one “99” value was exclude from the analysis). The reason
for this is that the research model in this work is designed to only use fully answered
questionnaires.

• Step 2: The aim of this step was to downsize the datasets with users who also gave a
clear statement about their vote intention. Users who answered “other,” “none,” or “did
not supply information” were excluded from the dataset.
• Step 3: In this step, the dataset reduction is based on the voter’s amount per candidate.
The equal distribution of the number of users per candidate is important to balance the
entries of each profile. Otherwise, the fuzzy c-mean algorithm would give preference to
the candidate who has more voters. Then, both datasets were reduced in order to have
an equal amount of voters among candidates (424 voters per candidate).
• Step 4: The last step is related to the dimensionality reduction of the dataset. Originally,
the experts’ vector contained 30 issue questions. To get a clearer image of the political
landscape, only fully answered issue questions by the candidates must be taken into
account for later analysis. Then, based on the 30 social topic questions of the experts’
answers, an elimination of incomplete answers with no opinion was done in the dataset
as well.

3.2

Sentiment Analysis Elements

The social media platform considered in this study to perform sentiment analysis is Twitter,
which is a micro-blog social networking service that enables users to publish and read short
140-character messages. The advantage of this social media platform is that all the posts are
public and it is possible to recall them via an API. The sentiment analysis considers two main
categories involved in the construction of the dynamic part of the candidate’s profile:
• Candidate Posts: Messages that a candidate re-tweets or writes personally on his/her
account.
• Candidate Tags: This represents the comments from other Twitter users (voters) where
the candidate may be related.
The dynamic candidate’s vector is built by the sum of two main categories (candidate tags
and candidate posts), which are mapped between the tweets and social categories. Equation 1
represents the calculation of the dynamic candidate’s vector, where the variable a is a fraction
between 0 and 1. For instance, if a = 0.3, then the candidate posts have 30% importance,
and the tags from the users 70%. This creates a more realistic scenario to create a vector that
represents the voters’ candidate perception. However, the value of a can be changed in further
studies in order to give more or equal importance to the vectors involved.

The tweet’s capture is performed with python in order to read and count the words in the
tweets of each candidate. Later in the absence of a Spanish sentiment analysis dictionary, a
human analysis will be needed in order to classify the words by topic and assign a value in the
vectors. As it was mentioned before, the value of a ensures that the two main categories do not
have the same relevance. For instance, the candidate posts may be fictitious or manipulated
in order to keep a good self-image, so it can be biased by the candidate. However, the posts
or tweets in which the candidate has been tagged are more representative, but there might be
still the problem of several external users working cooperatively to affect the public image of
a candidate by posting compromising messages or an Internet bot. At the end, the sentiment

analysis model considers whether users who tagged a candidate are authentic by observing
his or her number of followers. It is assumed that most of the Internet bots do not have
followers because the accounts are fake and automatically created. However, it is out of the
scope of this work to find an ideal method to avoid this potential bias. Once the Internet bot
detector is considered, the model by default takes into account an importance vector, which
gives more relevance to the tweets that come from the Twitter users rather than the ones
from the candidate. On the other hand, this study presents in the analysis section the level
of candidate popularity in social networks by counting the number of followers. Finally, the
dynamic vector can be calculated more often, and it can help users since it represents a more
spontaneous candidate perception. In terms of a campaign strategy, it reflects the strengths
and weaknesses of the candidate. It may be improved during a political campaign.

3.3

VAA Design

Knowing all the parts that compose the candidate profile model, it is time to explain the
algorithms in which our candidate model can be used and analyzed. The methods or algorithms
used to calculate the policy congruence in different studies and papers previously consulted
showed that there is not a standard algorithm to apply because all of them differ substantially
between VAA’s. While some use Euclidian distance to find the closest match, others use the city
block model. These two mathematical approaches for calculating distances between objects of
interest [7] affect the results of the matching procedure and therefore the voting recommendation
of the VAA. VAA designs are currently under intense scientific scrutiny, especially in terms
of the matching algorithms they employ [2]. Last but not least, the presentation of results
varies between VAA’s, with various procedures on how to visualize several issue positions in a
reduced form. VAA’s are increasingly used in election campaigns worldwide, thus their design
and methodology deserve closer attention, especially because the outputs they produce seem to
affect those who use them.
In this work and for the purposes of our study, two algorithms are considered, Euclidian
distance and a fuzzy c-means as it was proposed by Terán [12]. The system architecture
proposed by Terán and Kaskina [13] includes two types of profiles: static and dynamic.

Analysis and Evaluation

The analysis in this section is based on a comparison between two main scenarios: with and
without sentiment analysis to build the candidate’s vector. The first subsection starts with the
construction of the dynamic vector with the use of sentiment analysis. Later, the candidate
vector is created and integrated in the dataset. Finally, the data is computed with the fuzzy
c-mean algorithm in order to obtain the degrees of membership per voter – in other words, the
affinity percentage that user has among all the candidates.
Statistics of Twitter Accounts: There are several statistics or altmetrics that can be
calculated and obtained by analyzing the data of Twitter users, particularly the presence of the
candidates in the social network Twitter. The next altmetrics helped the study to determine
which candidates should be considered for the opinion mining. It will be explained later that
some candidates do not have enough information or present an absence of information to perform
a sentiment analysis and eventually later the VAA algorithms as will be observed in the case of
Ecuador.

The Case of Ecuador: During the study, it was possible to obtain the number of followers
and the amount of tweets that each candidate has had since the creation of their accounts. This
will help to grasp an idea about their Internet activity. The top candidate is Rafael Correa with
2,732,483 followers; this represents a huge gap with the other candidates, especially with Nelson
Zavala, who barely has followers (842). Another relevant altmetric is the number of tweets that
each candidate has published. It is not necessary for the one who has more followers. These
altmetrics are just the overview of several options. It is also possible to get more granularity,
such as with the classification of followers by sex, location, etc.

4.1

Euclidian Distance

The most often used algorithm and encountered space in several VAA’s recommender systems
is Euclidean distance. Distance computation has been widely used in several studies to provide
a quick comparison between users or to provide recommendations. The smaller the value of the
distance, the greater the similarity between two elements. In our case, every question represents
a dimension, and all the dimensions are represented by a vector; in other words, the length of
the vector denotes the number of dimensions. In this section, the analysis is based on people
who answered the supreme questions about vote intention. It then measures the euclidian
distance between the voter and classifies it into a candidate’s set.
For the purposes of this study and based on the Twitter datasets collected as well as the
data cleaning of the dataset, it is only possible to classify voters from the datasets in the preprocessing phase by this method. It contains most of the candidates, and the provided static
candidates’ profiles can be compared with the supreme questions. Based on the altmetrics,
three candidates in the social networks do not have enough activity, so it was only possible to
compute the top five candidates. The results and comparisons of this method are explained
in more detail in the work of Mancera [8]. In resume it is possible to observe that the vote
intention of voters changes with time, and the voters’ positions with respect to a candidate are
not fixed. Nevertheless, Euclidean distance is only a fast comparison method that cannot tell
us what causes that preference change in the users, for instance.

4.2

Candidate Vector Integration

As briefly mentioned before, Euclidean distance is limited to providing some answers or details
about the voters and candidates. In this part, Scenario A (without sentiment analysis) and
Scenario B (with sentiment analysis) are shown in Figures 1a and 1b, respectively. In this
section, we present what the data from candidates and voters looks like before the use of
the fuzzy c-means algorithm, which computes the final center of clusters. At this point, it
is possible to appreciate some differences already. Figure 1a shows the initial position of the
candidates without a profile that includes sentiment analysis. Based on the 30 social questions,
the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was applied for dimensionality reduction to
present the data points in a bi-dimensional map. In addition, the voters are also plotted in
this map. In contrast, Figure 1b shows the initial position of each candidate, this time with
the proposed candidate profile. Apparently the candidate’s position seems the same in the
superior part of the figure, so candidates such as Alberto Acosta, Rafael Correa, and Norman
Wray remain in the same position. Meanwhile, Guillermo Lasso and Mauricio Rodas have a
different initial centers than in Figure 1a without sentiment analysis. This indicates that in
the period of time after the experts analyzed each candidate to define the candidates’ profiles,
their answers and opinions changed or no longer correspond with their answers provided during
the survey. In other words, in the meantime, they could have either changed their ideology

or simply influenced their opinions in order to favor some candidates to obtain more electoral
supporters.

Fuzzy-Based VAA

Figure 2a provides the results of the final candidates’ clusters. These final clusters will determine
the degree of membership of each voter and the voter classification later. Figures 2a and 2b
are considered the same for the calculation of the final centers. The final center positions
remain almost equal, and the sentiment changes do not have a big impact on the voters’ cluster
classification. However, more details about the membership degree by voter will be presented
further in order to compare numerically and to appreciate in more detail their differences.

Dynamic VAA Visualization

It this work, we could observe that in the case of Ecuador, there is an influence from social
media on the Internet. Notice how the preferences of the candidates have changed. The degrees
of membership from the fuzzy cluster algorithm provide the levels of membership among voters,
which help to compare the differences among the final centers suggested by the algorithm. As
was mentioned before, the case of Ecuador did not bring drastic changes in the final clusters
in terms of voters’ classification, but it shows a membership difference for a particular voter,
assigned with number 200 in the dataset. This voter (200) was selected from the dataset because
her represents the case when a voter is deciding his/her vote between two different candidates.
In Figs. 3a and 3b, it is possible to compare the same voter (200) between the case with and
without sentiment analysis. As was mentioned before, it is possible to observe that the voter
(200) is between two candidates, Mauricio Rodas and Guillermo Lasso. Although it is assumed
that he or she could choose the candidate with major affinity (higher percentage), it is possible
to recognize that the voter has increased his affinity with Mauricio Rodas rather than with
Guillermo Lasso. These small changes show that even if there is not a big distortion in the
candidate’s ideology with sentiment analysis, the users are dynamic and tend to change their
perception of the candidate. There is also an impact from what a candidate says and does in
their social networks, which opens many different questions for different studies in this field.

Conclusions

This study represents the first of this type to compare two different complex scenarios with
and without sentiment analysis for VAA’s recommendation design. It shows good insights that
sentiment analysis is an element nowadays that must be included as a part of any VAA study. It
also implements an innovative fuzzy clustering algorithm that presents rich information in the
results, especially for classifying voters and their level of membership compared to candidate
profiles. Fuzzy clustering algorithms are more complex to calculate, and they do not classify
sharply; they assign a certain level of affinity or membership among the candidates and the
voters, which can be later interpreted easily by people. At the end, voters do not always agree

100% with a candidate; they may still like other ideologies from other candidates, but the
power of fuzzy algorithms can be lied upon to understand the amount of affinity one has for a
certain candidate or ideology. Although this algorithm presents many advantages, it also has
the disadvantage that if a candidate does not have enough users or supporters who provide
information to be considered by the fuzzy algorithm, then the final recommendation will be
poor in that other candidates with more information will be privileged in a recommendation.
Therefore, the more information the voters and candidates can provide, the better the final
recommendation will be. This work offers meaningful results and new insights between the
relationship of voters and candidates. Nevertheless, new questions are raised that can be part
of future studies: What is the right level of granularity for survey questions?, how sentiment
analysis can be more effective if more parameters are considered? What are the potential
changes in perception when adding more elements to the candidate profile? Finally, this work
provides an ideal basis for future research in terms of fuzzy-based VAA recommender systems
with sentiment analysis for the creation of dynamic profiles, and it motivates further inquiries
in the field of VAA’s.
