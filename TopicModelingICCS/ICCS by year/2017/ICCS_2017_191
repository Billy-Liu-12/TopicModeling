the last few years, a number of publications has been considered Nano-ferrofluids in oil and gas
recovery or environmental applications (e.g. Refs. [1, 2, 3, 7]). In the current work, we developed
a mathematical model to describe the magnetic nanoparticles–water suspension that imbibes
into a water-oil two–phase flow in porous media under magnetic field effect. Countercurrent imbibition benchmark problem is taken as an example. Physical variables are investigated under
the influences of magnetic field.

Modeling and Mathematical Formulation

Consider suspension of magnetic nanoparticles injected in a water-oil two-phase flow under
an external magnetic field. In the followings, we describe the mathematical modeling of the
problem under consideration [8, 10]. The external magnetic force acts as a body force on the
nanoparticles suspension per unit volume which can be expressed as [2], Fmag = µ0 M ∂H
∂z , µ0 is
the magnetic permeability, M is the magnetization and H is the magnetic field strength. The
magnetization M is a function of H, approximated by, M = a1 tan−1 (b1 H). The parameters
a1 and b1 depend on the particular type of the ferromagnetic material. The magnetic field
strength in 1D was given in Refs. [2, 13]. In the current model, we treat the water-nanoparticles
suspension as a miscible mixture while it is immiscible with the oil phase. For the immiscible
conceptualization, density and viscosity are considered properties of the respective phases, and
no mixing relations are required. Therefore, in the current model we consider immiscible twophase (water-oil) model and the water phase itself is a miscible mixture. So, the magnetization
of this system is, M (Sw , c) = M (Sw = 1, c = 1)Sw c. Oldenburg et al. [2] have assumed
that the volumes of pure water and ferrofluid are additive, and define for the mixture density
+ ρcf . ρw,p is the density of water component and ρf is the density of ferrofluid
as, ρ1w = ρ1−c
w,p
component. Viscosity effects in miscible ferrofluid–water mixtures are incorporated through the
correlation, µw = µw,p (1 + µ1 c). Given φ[-] as the porosity, ρα [kg·m−3 ] is the density of phase
α , Sα [–] is the saturation of phase α and uα [m·s−1 ] is the velocity of phase α. w stands for the
nanoparticles-water suspension phase, and o stands for the oil phase. K[m2 ] is the permeability,
krα [–] is the relative permeability of phase–α, pα [Pa] is the pressure of phase–α, g[m·s−2 ] is the
gravitational acceleration, and µα [Pa·s] is the viscosity of phase–α. The fluid saturations for the
two-phase flow of water and oil are related by, Sw + So = 1. In the countercurrent imbibition,
the sum of the velocities of the wetting and non–wetting phases is zero, ut = uw + uo = 0.
The capillary pressure is defined as, pc = po − pw . The magnetized phase pressure will have
additional pressure term with the conventional thermodynamic pressure. The resulting pressure
is called composite pressure [1], which can be given as, p∗w = pw + (pm + ps + pn ), pw is the
ferrofluid phase dynamic pressure, pm is the fluid magnetic pressure, ps is the magneto-strictive
pressure, and pn is the magnetic normal pressure, which is neglected in this study. Eliminating

where c[m3 ·m−3 ] is the concentration of nanoparticles in the water phase. cs1 [m3 ·m−3 ] is the

pore surfaces per unit bulk volume of the porous medium. cs2 [m3 ·m−3 ] is the volume of the
nanoparticles entrapped in pore throats from the water phase per unit bulk volume of porous
medium due to plugging and bridging. D[m2 ·s−1 ] is the molecular diffusion coefficient. The
modified model for the surface deposition is used in this study [5, 4]. The surface deposition
only particle retention occurs while above it retention and entrainment of the nanoparticles
take place simultaneously, which can be modeled as,

(6)

where γd [m−1 ] is the rate coefficients for surface retention of the nanoparticles in the water
phase. γe [m−1 ] is the rate coefficients for entrainment of the nanoparticles. uc is the critical
velocity for the water phase. γpt [m−1 ] is the pore throat blocking constants.

Results and Discussion

The above highly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation is solved numerically using
an efficient algorithm [12]. The spatial discretization is handled by Galerkin method, while an
adaptive time step is used with the time integration. The above governing equations (3), (4),
(5) and (6) are solved along with their initial and boundary conditions [9]. The parameters
values that used in the computations are provided in [5, 9]. The magnet field is located to the
right of the core, with respect to the core. It is interesting to notice from Fig. 1 (upper left) that
as the effect of the magnet increases the saturation of nanoparticles–water suspension increases.
This can be explained through an important fact that is the magnetic force is proportional to
magnetic field strength, so fluid that is closer to the magnet is more strongly magnetized and
pulled more strongly toward the magnet. From Fig. 1 (upper right), it can be seen that after
long time of imbibition, the nanoparticles concentration decreases slightly under the effect of
the magnetic field. Fig. 1 (middle left) shows the concentration of deposited nanoparticles on

the pore-wall as plotted against the core length with and without magnetic field effect for various values imbibition times. Also, Fig. 1 (middle right) shows the concentration of entrapped
nanoparticles on the pore-throat which is plotted against the core length with and without
magnetic field effect for various values imbibition times. As expected the deposited nanoparticles have an opposite behavior of the nanoparticles in the water, i.e., when the nanoparticles
concentration in the water decreases, the deposited nanoparticles concentration increases.
In our work [13], we presented the general two-dimensional case of the current problem.
The magnet is supposed to be placed at the right upper side of the domain. Distributions of
the water saturation without and with the effect of the magnetic field are shown in Fig. 2. One
may notice from this figure that the magnetic field has a clear effect on the distribution of the
water saturation due to the attraction of magnetic nanoparticles toward the magnet which is
located at the upper right side of the domain.

Conclusions

This paper was devoted to study the magnetic field effects on the magnetic nanoparticles
injected into a two–phase water–oil system in porous media. The countercurrent imbibition in
a small core is considered as a benchmark problem. Effects of the magnetic field on the physical
variables such as saturation and nanoparticles concentrations have been examined. Simulation
results are introduced for both locations of the magnet. The saturation of nanoparticles–water
suspension increases. The nanoparticles concentration decreases slightly under the effect of the
magnetic field. The deposited nanoparticles concentration increases.
