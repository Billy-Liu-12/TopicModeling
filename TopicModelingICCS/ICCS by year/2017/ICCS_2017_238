lead to price dynamics not observed in any other market and thus make accurate electricity
price forecasting a challenging task [32].
Over the past seventeen years since the year 2000, a wide variety of methods and ideas
have been published for electricity price forecasting (EPF) with varying degrees of success,
which can be categorised into linear statistical methods and nonlinear machine learning models [28]. For linear models, normally statistical theories and mathematical equations are used for
extrapolating the future values of TS. The most successful linear models include linear regression [25], Holt-Winters exponential smoothing [18], Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) [3], and so on. Machine learning methods can learn features from and also make
predictions on TS data, which build a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven
predictions, instead of following strictly static program instructions [21]. With the rapid development of computational intelligence, machine learning methods have been widely applied
for various research fields including short-term electricity price forecasting. The most widely
used machine learning algorithms include artificial neural network (ANN) [9], support vector
regression (SVR) [8], fuzzy comprehensive evaluation [34], etc.
Kernel machines has become very popular since Support Vector Machine (SVM) being introduced in 1995 [8]. To define complex functions of the input space, SVM performs a non-linear
mapping of the data into a high dimensional space, which is known as “kernel tricks”. SVM
has the advantage of giving a single solution that is characterized by the global minimum of
the optimized functional, compared to ANN which is frequently trapped in a local minimum.
Many SVM based electricity price forecasting algorithms exist in the literature. For example,
in [6], a hybrid model called SVR-ARIMA that combines both SVR and ARIMA models was
proposed for short term EPF problems. Besides for SVM, possibly the most elementary algorithm that can be kernelized is ridge regression. In other words, Kernel Ridge Regression
(KRR) combines Ridge Regression (linear least squares with l2−norm regularization) with the
kernel trick. In contrast to SVR, fitting KRR can be done in closed-form and is typically faster
for medium-sized datasets [17, 35].
Ensemble learning methods, or hybrid methods, aim to obtain better forecasting performance by strategically combining multiple algorithms. Dietterich has concluded the success
of ensemble methods due to three fundamental reasons: statistical, computational and representational [11]. Ensemble learning can be divided into two categories according to the way
of combination sequential and parallel [29]. In a sequentially combined ensemble method,
the outputs from several forecasting models are treated as the inputs to another forecasting
method [4, 27]. For a parallel combined ensemble method, the training TS is decomposed into
a collection of sub-datasets [7]. Then we train a forecasting model for each TS, and aggregate
the outputs from all the models to calculate final prediction results. There are many examples
of parallel ensemble methods in the literature, such as wavelet decomposition [15, 19], empirical
mode decomposition (EMD) [20] and negative correlation learning [2].
In this paper, an ensemble method composed of EMD, KRR and SVR is proposed for
short-term electricity load demand forecasting. The attractiveness of the proposed method
are demonstrated on real world datasets compared with six benchmark learning algorithms:
Persistence, SVR, SLFN, KRR, EMD based SVR and EMD based SLFN models.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the theoretical
background on forecasting methods. Section 3 presents the algorithm of proposed EMD-KRRSVR approach. Section 4 shows the procedures for experiment setup, followed by the discussion
about experiment results in Section 5. Finally in Section 6, the conclusions and future works
are stated.

Review of Forecasting Models
Support Vector Regression

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm proposed by Cortes and
Vapnik [8] based on statistical learning theory. Structural risk minimization is the basic concept
of this method. A version of SVM for regression was proposed in [12]. Support vector regression
(SVR) has been widely applied in time series forecasting problems [30].
Suppose a time series data set is given as follows
D = {(Xi , yi )} , 1 ≤ i ≤ N

(1)

where Xi is the input vector at time i with m elements and yi is the corresponding output data.
The regression function can be defined as
f (Xi ) = W T φ(Xi ) + b

(2)

where W is the weight vector, b is the bias, and φ(X) maps the input vector X to a higher
dimensional feature space. W and b can be obtained by solving the following optimization
problem:
N

Subject to:

yi − W T (ϕ(x)) − b ≤ ξ + εi

W T (ϕ(x)) + b − yi ≤ ξ + ε∗i
εi , ε∗i

(3)

(4)

≥0

where C is a predefined positive trade-off parameter between model simplicity and generalization ability, ξi and ξi∗ are the slack variables measuring the cost of the errors.
For nonlinear input data set, kernel functions can be used to map from original space onto
a higher dimensional feature space in which a linear regression model can be built. Thus, the
final SVR function is obtained as
yi = f (Xi ) =

N

i=1

((αi − α∗i )K(Xi , Xj )) + b

(5)

where αi and αi∗ are the Lagrange multipliers. The most frequently used kernel function is the
Gaussian radial function (RBF) with a width of σ
2

K(Xi , Xj ) = exp(− Xi − Xj  /(2σ 2 ))

2.2

Kernel Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is a linear model which addresses ordinary least squares by imposing a penalty
on the size of coefficients (l2-norm regularization) [26]. The ridge coefficients minimize a penalized residual sum of squares which is shown as follows:
min ||Xw − y||22 + α||w||22
w

where α is a complexity parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage. The coefficients
are more robust to collinearity as α becomes lager.
Kernel ridge regression (KRR) combines Ridge Regression with the kernel trick [17, 35].
Thus it constructs a linear model in the space induced by the kernel we used for the data. The
form of the model learned by KRR is similar with SVR, except for the different loss functions.
KRR uses squared error loss instead of ε-insensitive loss which is applied in SVR. Moreover,
KRR can be trained in closed-form and is typically faster for medium-sized datasets.

2.3

Empirical Mode Decomposition

EMD [20], also known as Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), is a method to decompose a signal
into several intrinsic mode functions (IMF) along with a residue which stands for the trend.
EMD is an empirical approach to obtain instantaneous frequency data from non-stationary and
nonlinear data sets.
The system load is a random non-stationary process composed of thousands of individual
components. The system load behavior is influenced by a number of factors, which can be
classified as: economic factors, time, day, season, weather and random effects. Thus, EMD
algorithm can be very effective for load demand forecasting.
An IMF is a function that has only one extreme between zero crossings, along with a mean
value of zero. The shifting process which EMD uses to decompose the signal into IMFs is
described as follows:
1. For a time series signal x(t), let m1 be the mean of its upper and lower envelopes as
determined by a cubic-spline interpolation of local maxima and minima.
2. The first component h1 is computed by subtracting the mean from the original time series:
h1 = x(t) − m1 .
3. In the second shifting process, h1 is treated as the data, and m11 is the mean of h1 ’s
upper and lower envelopes: h11 = h1 − m11 .
4. This shifting procedure is repeated k times until one of the following stop criterion is
satisfied: i) m1k approaches zero, ii) the numbers of zero-crossings and extrema of h1k
differs at most by one, or iii) the predefined maximum iteration is reached. h1k can be
treated as an IMF in this case and computed by: h1k = h1(k−1) − m1k .
5. Then it is designated as c1 = h1k , the first IMF component from the data, which contains
the shortest period component of the signal. We separate it from the rest of the data:
x(t) − c1 = r1 . The procedure is repeated on rj : r1 − c2 = r2 ,. . . , r(n−1) − cn = rn .
nAs a result, the original time series signal is decomposed as a set of functions: x(t) =
i=1 (ci ) + rn , where the number of functions n in the set depends on the original signal.

Proposed Ensemble Method

In this work, an ensemble method called “divide and conquer” is employed, which works by
decomposing the original TS into a series of sub-datasets until they are simple enough to be
analyzed. For proposed EMD-KRR-SVR approach, as mentioned above, the electricity price
data is decomposed into several IMFs and one residue by EMD method. Then a KRR network
is trained for each IMF including the residue, which is much more efficient than using SVR or

SLFN. The final prediction results are given by combining the outputs from all sub-series using
an SVR model, which ensures the overall accuracy. Figure 1 is the schematic diagram of this
proposed ensemble method, and the procedures can be concluded as:
1. Apply EMD to decompose the original TS into several IMFs and one residue.
2. Construct the training matrix as the input of each KRR for each IMF and residue.
3. Train KRRs to obtain the prediction results for each of the extracted IMF and residue.
4. Combine all the prediction results by an SVR model to formulate an ensemble output for
TS forecasting.

Datasets

In this paper, the electricity price datasets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) [1]
were used for evaluating the performance of benchmark learning models. There are totally three
electricity price datasets of year 2016 from three states of Australia: New South Wales (NSW),
Tasmania (TAS) and Queensland (QLD). For each dataset, to reduce the influence of climate
change due to different season, four months were selected to perform comparison: January,
April, July and October. For each month, the first three weeks were used for training, while
the remaining one week was used for testing.

Methodology

For the time series electricity price datasets, all the training and testing values are linearly scaled
to [0, 1]. To implement the simulation, LIBSVM toolbox was used for the SVR model [5], while
neural network toolbox in Matlab was used for constructing neural networks, including SLFN
and EMD based SLFN (EMD-SLFN). Moreover, the Kernel Methods Toolbox for Matlab was
used for KRR and the proposed EMD-KRR-SVR approach [31].
For SVR and EMD based SVR, we use the RBF kernel function with parameters chosen by
a grid search. The range of C is [2−4 , 24 ], and the range of σ is [10−3 ,10−1 ]. For SLFN and
EMD-SLFN, the size of neural networks is determined by the size of input vector. The number
of iterations for back propagation is set as 1000. We choose Gaussian kernel as the kernel in
KRR. The regularization constant is searched within the range [10−8 , 108 ] with the stepsize of
100.2 ; while the range of Gaussian kernel width is [10−4 , 104 ] with the same stepsize.

4.3

Error Measurement

In this paper, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of learning
models. It is defined as

 n
1 
RM SE = 
(y  − yi )2
n i=1 i

(8)

where yi is the predicted value of corresponding yi , and n is the number of data points in
the testing time series.

Results and Discussion

In this section, six benchmark methods were implemented for electricity price forecasting to
perform a comparison with the proposed EMD-KRR-SVR model.

5.1

Performance comparison for short-term electricity price forecasting

In this work, the persistence method was employed as the baseline for comparing the performance of learning models. This method assumes the conditions at the future time the same
as the current values, which has good accuracy due to the highly periodic characteristic of
electricity price TS. The prediction results for short-term electricity price forecasting are shown
in Table 1, where the forecasting horizon is half an hour. The numbers in bold mean that
the corresponding method has the best performance for this dataset under this performance
measure. According to the prediction results, we can conclude that all the machine learning
models outperform the persistence method for short-term electricity price forecasting.
To reveal the advantages of EMD based ensemble methods, we implemented the single
structure models SVR, SLFN and KRR for EPF, and conducted an comparison with their EMD
hybrid models. Moreover, all of the EMD based ensemble methods have the best performance
cases, which shows that they have comparable performance with each other. However, the
proposed EMD-KRR-SVR achieves the best performance in most cases, which means that the
proposed method has more advantages compared with the benchmark models.

In order to give a detailed analysis of these results, we employ Friedman test [14] and
Nemenyi post-hoc test [23] to test the significance of the differences among these learning
models. The Friedman test ranks the algorithms for each dataset separately, and then assign
average ranks in case of ties. The null-hypothesis states that all the algorithms have the same
performance. If the null-hypothesis is rejected, in order to tell whether the performances of two
among totally k learning models are significantly different, the Nemenyi post-hoc test is applied
to compare all the learning models with each other. The comparison results of statistical test
based on RMSE is shown in Figure 2. The methods with better ranks are at the top whereas
the methods with worse ranks are at the bottom. It is worth noting that the models within a
vertical line whose length is less than or equal to a critical distance have statistically the same
performance. The critical distance for Nemenyi test is defined as:

k(k + 1)
(9)
CD = qα
6N
where k is the number of algorithms, N is the number √
of data sets, and qα is the critical
value based on the Studentized range statistic divided by 2 [10]. From the statistical test
results, the proposed EMD-KRR-SVR achieves the best rank and significantly outperforms the
non-EMD based methods with a 95% confidence.

Computation time comparison

Figure 3 shows the computation time of benchmark methods for load demand forecasting in
Tasmania (TAS). Obviously, the computational speed of KRR is superior than SLFN and SVR.
SVR requires a grid search on C and σ, and SLFN is iteratively tuned by BP algorithm to
convergence to the optimal weights. These repetitive parameter tuning processes cause SLFN
and SVR less efficient than KRR, which has closed form solutions.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed an ensemble kernel machines for short-term electricity price forecasting composed of EMD, KRR and SVR. The electricity price signal was first decomposed
into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD, followed by a KRR which was used to

model each extracted IMF and predict the tendencies. Finally, the prediction results of all
IMFs were combined by an SVR to obtain an aggregated output for electricity price. Three
electricity price datasets from AEMO were used for evaluating the performance of the proposed
method. Moreover, six benchmarks methods were implemented to perform a comparison with
the proposed method. From the forecasting results, the following conclusions are made:
1. EMD based hybrid methods, including EMD-SVR, EMD-SLFN and the proposed EMDKRR-SVR, significantly outperform the corresponding single structure models for short8

term electricity price time series forecasting.
2. The computation time of KRR is the shortest among all of the benchmark models.
3. The proposed EMD-KRR-SVR approach achieves the best performance for short-term
electricity price forecasting, and also has the advantages of efficiency.
For future research directions, more ensemble methods, such as bagging, can be combined
with KRR to make use of its advantages in computation time. Moreover, the concept of deep
learning can also be applied with KRR to develop deep kernel machines. Further, Kernel
machines and its ensemble models can also be tested using other types of TS, such as financial
data and renewable energy data, to evaluate the performance in the generic situation.
