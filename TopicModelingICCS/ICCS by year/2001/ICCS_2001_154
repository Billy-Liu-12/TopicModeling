Abstract. The Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) Brilliant Anti-Armor
BAT submunition High Fidelity Flight Simulation (HFS) is an all-digital, nonreal-time simulation that combines the P3I BAT Six-Degrees-of-Freedom (6DOF), a high fidelity dual mode seeker model, tactical flight software, and
infrared (IR) / millimeter-wave (MMW) scene generation to produce a tool
capable of system design, algorithm development and performance assessment.
The HFS development methodology emphasizes the use of high fidelity IR and
MMW imagery so that the seeker algorithms / tactical software can be
incorporated to form a Software-In-The-Loop (SWIL) simulation. The IR and
MMW scene generators use validated IR and MMW target signatures with
correlated IR and MMW backgrounds to produce a realistic scene for a variety
of battlefield scenarios. Both the IR and MMW scene generators have evolved
with the availability high performance computational capability and system
development to meet the design and performance assessment requirements of
the P3I BAT program.

Introduction
The Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) Brilliant Anti-Armor BAT submunition
High Fidelity Flight Simulation (HFS) is being developed by the U.S. Army Missile
Research, Development, and Engineering Center (MRDEC), Systems Simulation
Development Directorate (SS&DD) and the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System
(ATACMS) / BAT Project Office support contractor as a tool to support system
design evaluation, tactical algorithm development and performance assessment of the
P3I BAT system. The HFS combines the P3I BAT 6-DOF model, a high fidelity dual
mode seeker model, tactical flight software, and infrared (IR) / millimeter-wave
(MMW) scene generation into an integrated, all-digital, Software-In-The-Loop
(SWIL) simulation. As part of the P3I BAT suite of simulations, the HFS will be used
to evaluate, analyze and assess the performance of the P3I BAT system.

Along with being a standalone analytical tool, the HFS is the all-digital companion
tool for the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) simulation and flight testing, allowing for
extended scenario capabilities including additional targets and countermeasures. The
HFS development methodology emphasizes the use of high fidelity IR and MMW
imagery and tactical flight software-in-the-loop to maximize the commonalities
between the HFS, HWIL, and tactical submunition. This greatly simplifies
verification and validation (V&V) activities, and places a strong emphasis on IR and
MMW scene generation.
This paper addresses the IR and MMW scene generators currently being used in
the P3I BAT HFS, and how they have evolved with the availability of high
performance computational capability and system development to meet the design
and performance assessment requirements of the P3I BAT program.

Background

Fig. 1. P3I BAT Submunition

P3I BAT Submunition
The P3I BAT is the Pre-Planned Product Improvement for the Base BAT submunition
(Fig. 1). The BAT and P3I BAT systems, after being dispensed from the host vehicle
such as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), perform as autonomously
guided smart submunitions that are designed to search, detect, and defeat armored
vehicles in many weather conditions. The Base BAT submunition whose primary
mission is to attack moving armored target arrays, initially utilizes acoustics to
determine a general location of the target, then employs an IR seeker for acquisition

and terminal homing.
The P3I BAT submunition has the same physical
characteristics as the Base BAT configuration, but incorporates an improved dualmode (IR/MMW) seeker design and an improved warhead that allows it to engage
soft targets. These features greatly expand the possible engagement environments
and target set. [1]
HFS
The P3I BAT HFS is a high-fidelity closed-loop simulation of the P3I BAT
submunition that begins at dispense out of the carrier vehicle, and ends at
submunition impact on the target. The methodology for the HFS development is
primarily based on the methodology previously developed for the Javelin Antitank
weapon system Integrated Flight Simulation (IFS). [2, 3] One of the major
differences between these systems lies in the dual mode IR/MMW seeker used by the
P3I BAT submunition. The Javelin seeker is an earlier generation IR-only seeker, and
as such was not as complex to simulate and analyze as the dual mode P3I BAT
seeker. To date, there are no other known dual mode simulations that approach the
HFS in complexity and fidelity. [1]
The HFS was originally proposed as a tool to support the downselect between two
competing seeker developers for the P3I BAT submunition. By integrating the seeker
developer’s detailed seeker model and algorithms into the HFS environment, the
performance of each seeker design could be analyzed, and the effects of the seeker
design on overall system performance could be quantified. The role of the HFS has
since been expanded to include many areas, including providing the one
(submunition)-on-many (targets) performance capability as an input to the many
(submunitions)-on many (targets) system effectiveness simulation, STRIKE. [1]

Methodology
The HFS development methodology emphasizes four primary areas:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Reuse of Base BAT subsystem models common to P3I BAT
Use of tactical flight software-in-the-loop
Maximize use of common subsystem models between the HFS and HWIL.
Use of validated IR imagery and MMW measurement data for targets and
backgrounds.

The primary goals behind the methodology are to:
1. Reduce development time.
2. Simplify verification and validation activities.
3. Provide an accurate assessment of the system’s performance.
This approach to simulation development requires that the IR and MMW scene
generators incorporate high fidelity target and clutter models, and the dual mode
processing within the seeker requires that the MMW target and clutter models be

generated in registration with the corresponding IR model. The use of high fidelity
facet target models and backgrounds for the generation of IR imagery was a proven
simulation methodology under the Javelin program. However, the critical test for the
development of the P3I BAT HFS was to explore whether millimeter wave radar
“imagery” could be incorporated into the simulation and utilized at the same time as
the infrared imagery, with the same good results as those obtained using IR-only. No
information was available as to whether this idea was feasible. Discussions were held
with members of the MMW Longbow Hellfire Modular Missile System (LBHMMS)
HWIL simulation team to obtain their expert opinions on the feasibility of the idea.
They provided considerable information on the procedures and processes used to
simulate MMW targets and clutter using the HWIL MMW radar arrays in real time.
After these discussions, it was determined that these real-time HWIL modeling
processes could be adapted and merged with IR clutter techniques to be run in a nonreal-time all digital simulation. [1]

Model Development
The P3I BAT HFS IR and MMW scene generation development has evolved with the
availability of high performance computational capability and the requirements of the
P3I BAT program. To fully appreciate this evolution, the fidelity of the IR and
MMW target and clutter models will be discussed along with rendering techniques
applied for image generation.
IR Target Models
Under the Javelin program, the U.S. Army MRDEC Missile Guidance Directorate
(MGD) developed a methodology for applying IR target measurement data to 3
dimensional target facet models. A target geometry model is developed with
“enough” polygons to represent the resolution of the calibrated IR imagery. The
vertices are then “painted” with the collected measurements and rendered applying
gouraud shading. This target development and rendering methodology has proven to
be a valid approach on the Javelin missile programs, and was chosen for the P3I BAT
IR scene generator.
As the program matured and the P3I BAT HWIL facility was developed, it became
evident that the computational load to render the high polygon target models would
not meet the HWIL real-time requirements. So, the HWIL personnel developed a
methodology to decimate the number of facets, and apply texture(s) that would
adequately represent the resolution of the calibrated IR imagery. (see Fig. 2) [4]
Although the high polygon targets were not as much of an issue for the non-realtime HFS, the availability of low-cost high performance Silicon Graphics capable of
rendering 12 bit textured polygons made the incorporation of algorithms to render the
HWIL real-time targets possible, and the advantages offered by the approach include
improved scene generator efficiency and assures commonality with HWIL, reducing
cost and streamlining the verification and validation process.

MMW Target Models
Based on the LBHMMS HWIL experience, point scatterer models were developed for
the P3I BAT program. The MMW target models developed have 150 scatterers per
polarization per 0.5 degrees in azimuth and 5 degrees in depression. Each model has
been verified and validated by comparing model frequency-averaged RCS and HRR
aim-point statistics to those from the original measurement model [5]. The models
are registered to the IR model by correlating the scatterer locations geometrically to
the IR target coordinate frame. (see Fig. 3). [4]

Fig. 3. P3I BAT MMW Target Development Methodology. [4]

In the utilization of these models, the number of scattering bins generated in target
model development can approach 2,400 per polarization and more than 100 scattering
centers thresholded from these bins are typically chosen. The computational
requirements to process these scatterers are quite significant and a study has been
made to quantify the effects of reducing the number of scattering centers to reduce
run times and meet HWIL real-time requirements. Preliminary results indicate that the
reduction of scatterers by half will generate RCS and aim-point statistics that are
within the acceptable range of measurement statistics [5]. This reduction along with
conventional parallel processing techniques will allow the HFS MMW scene
generator to simulate complex battlefield scenarios within a reasonable amount of
runtime.

IR Clutter Models
Under the Javelin program, the U.S. Army MRDEC Missile Guidance Directorate
(MGD) developed a methodology for applying IR clutter measurement data to a class
map describing the site to be simulated. Each class map consists of description of the
features of the site and typically consists of 1-foot increment descriptions, with the
classes characterized as shown in Table 1.

Initially, the P3I BAT IR scene generator rendered the clutter as a polygon mesh
with each vertex “painted” to represent the measured class temperature data. If
topography data was available, each vertex elevation was modified appropriately. At
one foot resolution, the time to render the background was quite significant, and
efforts to improve the scene generation efficiency were investigated. Again, the
availability of low-cost high performance Silicon Graphics capable of rendering 12 bit
textured polygons made it possible to represent the clutter with fewer polygons and
still maintain the resolution of the class map. This approach was also chosen by the
HWIL facility and provides one more area of commonality between the HFS and
HWIL simulation domains.

MMW Clutter Models
The dual mode processing with the P3I BAT seeker requires that the MMW
backgrounds be generated in registration with the corresponding IR model. This is
controlled by the utilization of a class map (see IR Clutter Model description).
Normalized sigma0 values obtained from collected measurement data are used in
conjunction with the corresponding class map to generate the normalized even and
odd polarization clutter map. This is obtained by applying the statistics reported to:
��(random, normalized) = ��(normalized) + 20log10r

(1)

where r is a Raleigh distribution with a mean of 1. The user then computes the sine of
the depression angle to the given clutter patch and applies:
�� = �sin�

(2)

where � is the depression angle and � is the normalized sigma0. This model is
considered valid in the range of depression angles of interest to this program. [6]
Currently, the BAT P3I HFS MMW scene generator has the option to read in pregenerated clutter maps or to dynamically generate the clutter maps on a run-to-run
basis. Depth buffer data obtained from the IR scene generator provides information
on which cells are “shadowed” by the target, and the model generates a list of sigma0
values to be processed. As can be imagined, the computational requirements are
significant and efforts to optimize clutter cell processing are underway. This includes
investigating the application of HWIL real-time optimized vector processing
techniques.

Verification and Validation
Verification and validation of the P3I BAT IR and MMW scene generators is an
ongoing process. The approach of utilizing IR and MMW target models that are
developed with collected, not predicted, data simplifies the process but still requires
that each model is validated with the calibrated measurement data. On the P3I BAT
program, the target and clutter model developers have established and implemented
verification and validation procedures to the approval and satisfaction of P3I BAT
simulation community. In addition, the techniques by which the scene generators
generate the simulated battlefield have been proven valid on other programs. The
utilization of HWIL and flight test data has been critical in the verification and
validation process and the commonality between the HFS and HWIL scene generation
has streamlined these activities. Fig. 4 shows an example comparison between HFS
and test IR imagery.

Current Utilization
The P3I BAT HFS is currently being used in several studies. One study in particular
is being performed to evaluate the tracker algorithms performance across a suite of
target and clutter models. To support this study, upgrades to the IR and MMW scene
generators were implemented to support the large Monte Carlo run matrices to be
executed. One such upgrade has been proven to be instrumental in the timely
execution of the analysis. Historically, IR and MMW clutter models are pregenerated and clutter variation is only obtained by reading in a new pre-generated
model that is quite timely on a run-to-run basis. The P3I BAT signatures IPT
developed a methodology in which collected class map statistics for particular sites,
seasonal, and weather conditions were processed to form a clutter vector. For a
Monte Carlo run set, both the IR and MMW scene generators utilize these clutter
vectors to dynamically generate textures (IR) and normalized clutter maps (MMW) at

566

the beginning of each run. In addition, a methodology was defined to apply a level
term to the IR target model and allow for “yesterday’s” target be placed in “today’s”
background. This capability provided the HFS an efficient means to Monte Carlo the
IR and MMW clutter models, and allowed the evaluators to study the effects of clutter
variation on the tracker algorithms.

Future Enhancements
There are several ongoing and planned activities to enhance the capabilities of the P3I
BAT HFS IR and MMW scene generators. The activities are currently centered
around increasing the fidelity and complexity of the simulated battlefield and
implementing optimization techniques currently utilized in the HWIL simulation.
Upgrades include the addition of discrete objects such as individual trees and
buildings, and realistic target exhaust plume heating and obscuration effects.
Battlefield effects such as burning targets and countermeasures (smoke, flares, etc.)
will also be added as those models are developed.
In addition, the personnel responsible for the P3I BAT HWIL are currently
responsible for developing a MMW scene generator for the Common Missile program
that utilizes the HWIL real-time vector processing techniques. MMW scene
generator optimization will be leveraged on this activity.

Conclusion
The development of the P3I BAT HFS IR and MMW scene generators is ongoing.
The methodology of utilizing IR and MMW target models developed with collected
measurement data has given the fidelity required to generate realistic imagery of the
simulated battlefield. The availability of low-cost high performance computers has
allowed for the implementation of real-time scene generation techniques and has
increased the commonality between the HFS and HWIL simulation. As development
progresses, the HFS will become an even more powerful tool for performance
assessment, system design and algorithm development.
