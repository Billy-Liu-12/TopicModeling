Abstract
We describe a new graduate program at the Univesity of Utah that we consider
a �rst step towards the modernization of the Universitys curriculum in what we
call Computational Engineering and Science (CES). Our goal is to provide a
mechanism by which a graduate student can obtain integrated expertise and skills
in all areas that are required for the solution of a particular computational problem.

1 Computational Engineering and Science Program
The grand computational challenges in engineering and science require for their resolution a new scienti�c approach. As one report points out, The use of modern computers
in scienti�c and engineering research and development over the last three decades has
led to the inescapable conclusion that a third branch of scienti�c methodology has been
created. It is now widely acknowledged that, along with traditional experimental and
theoretical methodologies, advanced work in all areas of science and technology has
come to rely critically on the computational approach. This methodology represents a
new intellectual paradigm for scienti�c exploration and visualization of scienti�c phenomena. It permits a new approach to the solution of problems that were previously
inaccessible.
At present, too few researchers have the training and expertise necessary to utilize
fully the opportunities presented by this new methodology; and, more importantly, traditional educational programs do not adequately prepare students to take advantage of
these opportunities.
Too often we have highly trained computer scientists whose knowledge about engineering and sciences is at the college sophomore, or lower, level. Traditional educational programs in each of these areas stop at the sophomore level  or earlier  in
the other area. Also, education tends to be ad hoc, on the job and self-taught.

This situation has arisen because the proper utilization of the new methodology requires expertise and skills in several areas that are considered disparate in traditional
educational programs. The obvious remedy is to create new programs that do provide
integrated training in the relevant areas of science, mathematics, technology, and algorithms. The obvious obstacles are territorial nature of established academic units,
entrenched academic curricula, and a lack of resources.
At the University of Utah the School of Computing (located in the College of Engineering), with the Departments of Mathematics and Physics (located in the College
of Science) have established a graduate program that we consider a �rst step towards
the modernization of the Universitys curriculum in what we call Computational Engineering and Science (CES). Our goal is to provide a mechanism by which a graduate
student can obtain integrated expertise and skills in all areas that are required for the
solution of a particular problem via the computational methodology.
We have built upon an established certi�cate program and recently created an M.S.
CES degree program. If the M.S. CES program is successfel, we will consider expanding the program to a Ph.D. in CES. Our program is designed mostly for students in
the Colleges of Engineering, Mines, and Science. However, in principle any graduate
student at the University can participate.
To obtain the MS degree in CES, a student must complete courses and present original thesis research (for the thesis option) in each of the following areas:
I. Introduction to Scienti�c Computing
II. Advanced Scienti�c Computation
III. Scienti�c Visualization
IV. Mathematical Modeling
V. Case Studies in CES
VI. Elective course
VII. Seminar in Computational Engineering and Science
Of the above items, only V and VII are truly new requirements. Numerical Analysis
has been taught in our departments for several years. Mathematical modeling has been
spread over a large number of courses in the current Mathematics curriculum; the new
course has been designed particularly for the CES program and has replaced one or
more other courses in the students load. The situation in regard to courses I and III in
the Computer Science curriculum is very similar.

All courses are designed for �rst- or second-year science and engineering graduate
students who have a knowledge of basic mathematics and computing skills. The most
innovative aspect of our CES program is course V., Case Studies in CES. This course
consists of presentations by science and engineering faculty from various departments
around the campus. These faculty, all active in computationally intensive research, introduce students to their own work over intervals of, typically, three weeks. The course
provides students with a reasonably deep understanding of both the underlying science and engineering principles involved in the various projects and the practical issues
confronting the researchers. It also provide a meeting place for faculty and graduate
students engaged in CES activities in various departments throughout campus. In the
CES seminar (VII) students are be required to report on their own CES activities to their
peers.
This approach, then, will serve the students by at once focusing their activities and
bringing together in one place several essential components of CES that were previously
spread over a larger and less clearly de�ned part of the existing curriculum. In addition,
the program will help students learn to work with researchers in other disciplines and to
understand how expertise in another �eld can help propel their own research forward.
The program is administered by a director and a steering committee consisting
of two members each from the departments of mathematics, physics and the school of
computing. The committee is advised by a board of faculty active in CES research.

2 Computational Engineering and Science Research
The University of Utah has a rich pool of faculty who are active in the various areas involved in CES. These include �elds such as computational �uid dynamics, physics and
chemistry, earthquake simulation, computational medicine, pharmacy, biology, computational combustion, materials science, climate modeling, genetics, scienti�c visualization and numerical techniques. A few examples of some of the current research in these
areas follow.

2.1 Scienti�c visualization
Common to many of the computational science application areas is the need to visualize model geometry and simulation results. The School of Computing at the University
of Utah has been a pioneer and leader in computer graphics and scienti�c visualization
research and education. Some of the �rst scienti�c visualizations were invented and
displayed here (e.g. , the use of color for �nite element analysis and the use of geometrical visualizations of molecules). Furthermore, is one of the sites of the NSF Science

Computational Engineering and Science Program 1179

and Technology Center (STC) for Computer Graphics and Scienti�c Visualization. The
STC supports collaboration on a national level among leading computer graphics and
visualization groups (Brown, CalTech, Cornell, UNC, and Utah) and provides graduate
students with a unique opportunity for interaction with this extended graphics family. Utah is also home to the Scienti�c Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute [1].
SCI Institute researchers have innovated several new techniques to effectively visualize
large-scale computational �elds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
Example of SCI Institute visualization work is shown in Figures 1-3.

2.2 Computational Combustion
Professor Philip Smith of the Department of Chemical Engineering has been developing large scale computer simulators that couple 3D computational �uid dynamics with
reaction, heat transfer, radiation, turbulence, and particle transport to compute local
combustion behavior in full scale utility boilers. Professor Smith has been collaborating with Dr. Kwan-Liu Ma and Professor Chris Sikorski of the Department of Computer
Science to develop computer visualization methods for better understanding the simulation results. Their research contributes to the technological advances of the United
States by helping to minimize pollutant formation and to maximize ef�ciency for combustion systems.

a large-scale model of a patients head within a stereo, immersive environment. The
colored streamlines indicate the current from a simulation of epilepsy.
The University of Utah has created an alliance with the DOE Accelerated Strategic
Computing Initiative (ASCI) to form the Center for the Simulation of Accidental Fires
and Explosions (C-SAFE). It focuses speci�cally on providing state-of-the-art, sciencebased tools for the numerical simulation of accidental �res and explosions, especially
within the context of handling and storage of highly �ammable materials. The objective of C-SAFE is to provide a system comprising a problem-solving environment in
which fundamental chemistry and engineering physics are fully coupled with non-linear
solvers, optimization, computational steering, visualization and experimental data veri�cation. The availability of simulations using this system will help to better evaluate
the risks and safety issues associated with �res and explosions. Our team will integrate
and deliver a system that will be validated and documented for practical application to
accidents involving both hydrocarbon and energetic materials.

2.3 Mathematical and Computational Biology
The Mathematics Department at the University of Utah is home to one of the worlds
largest and most active research groups in Mathematical Biology. The work in this
group centers on understanding the biological mechanisms that regulate the dynamics
of important physiological, biochemical, biophysical, and ecological interactions. A

Computational Engineering and Science Program 1181

major focus of research, lead by Aaron Fogelson, is in using mathematics and computation to understand how the complex biochemical and biophysical components, especially the �uid dynamics, of platelet aggregation and coagulation interact in hemostasis
(normal blood clotting) and thrombosis (pathological blood clotting within blood vessels). This fascinating area has tremendous practical importance because thrombosis is
the immediate cause of most heart attacks and strokes. Because the models of clotting
are very complex (they involve �uid dynamics, �uid-structure interactions, chemical
kinetics, chemical and mass transport), they pose substantial computational challenges,
and have required the development of novel numerical methods and software to meet
these challenges. This software has been and is being applied to a wide range of biological problems in which �uid �ow plays an important role. A second major research
area, led by James Keener, involves modeling and three-dimensional computation of
electrical waves in cardiac muscle. The goal is to understand normal signal propagation and the coupling between the electrical stimuli and cardiac muscle contraction, to
understand the mechanisms underlying the onset of pathological arrythmias, and to understand at the cellular and tissue level how de�brillation works so as to help optimize
de�brillation strategies. Some of the other work in the group includes studies of information processing in the primary visual cortex, models of territoriality in interacting
animal populations, and studies of invasion of ecosystems by new species.

2.4 Computational Medicine
An interdisciplinary team of nationally recognized research centers at Utah involving
the Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute (CVRTI), the Scienti�c Computing
and Imaging (SCI) Institute, the Center for Advanced Medical Technology (CAMT),
and the Neurosurgery Department are working together to tackle large-scale computational problems in medicine.
Every year, approximately 500,000 people die suddenly because of abnormalities
in their hearts electrical system (cardiac arrhythmias) and/or from coronary artery disease. While external de�brillation units have been in use for some time, their use is
limited because it takes such a short time for a heart attack victim to die from insuf�cient oxygen to the brain. Lately, research has been initiated to �nd a practical way
of implanting electrodes within the body to de�brillate a person automatically upon
onset of cardiac �brillation. Because of the complex geometry and inhomogeneous
nature of the human thorax and the lack of sophisticated thorax models, most past design work on de�brillation devices has relied on animal studies. We have constructed a
large-scale model of the human thorax, the Utah Torso Model [12, 13, 14, 15], for simulating both the endogenous �elds of the heart and applied current sources (de�brillation
devices). Using these computer models, We are also able to simulate the multitude
of electrode con�gurations, electrode sizes, and magnitudes of de�brillation shocks.
Given the large number of possible external and internal electrode sites, magnitudes,
and con�gurations, it is a daunting problem to computationally test and verify various con�gurations. For each new con�guration tested, geometries, mesh discretization
levels, and a number of other parameters must be changed.
Excitation currents in the brain produce an electrical �eld that can be detected as
small voltages on the scalp. By measuring changes in the patterns of the scalps electrical activity, physicians can detect some forms of neurological disorders. Electroencephalograms, EEGs, measure these voltages; however, they provide physicians with
only a snapshot of brain activity. These glimpses help doctors spot disorders but are
sometimes insuf�cient for diagnosing them. For the latter, doctors turn to other techniques; in rare cases, to investigative surgery.
Such is the case with some forms of epilepsy. To determine whether a patient who is
not responding to medication has an operable form of the disorder, known as temporal
lobe epilepsy, neurosurgeons use an inverse procedure to identify whether the abnormal
electrical activity is highly localized (thus operable) or diffused over the entire brain.
To solve these two bioelectric �eld problems in medicine, we have created two
problem solving environments, SCIRun and BioPSE [16, 17], to design internal de�brillator devices and measure their effectiveness in an interactive graphical environment

Computational Engineering and Science Program 1183

[18]. Similarly we are using these PSEs to develop and test computational models of
epilepsy [19] as shown in Figure 1.
Using SCIRun and BioPSE, scientists and engineers are able to design internal de�brillation devices and source models for the epileptic foci, place them directly into
the computer model, and automatically change parameters (size, shape and number of
electrodes) and source terms (position and magnitude of voltage and current sources) as
well as the mesh discretization level needed for an accurate �nite element solution. Furthermore, engineers can use the interactive visualization capabilities to visually gauge
the effectiveness of their designs and simulations in terms of distribution of electrical
current �ow and density maps of current distribution.

2.5 Computational Physics
Several computational science opportunities are offered by the Physics Department.
Students can gain experience in computational physics on platforms ranging from small
Beowulf clusters to supercomputers at the national laboratories to the most powerful,
special-purpose computers available in the world.
1. High Energy Astrophysics
The High Resolution Flys Eye and the High Energy Gamma Ray research groups
collect terabytes of observational data that require processing on high performance parallel computers. Monte Carlo simulations of detector performance and
of theories also require intensive computation. The goal of this research is to
understand the origins and production mechanisms of the mysterious, energetic
particles. Professors Pierre Sokolsky, David Kieda, Eugene Loh, Charles Jui, Kai
Martens, Wayne Springer, and Vladimir Vassiliev participate in this work.
2. The Evolution of the Universe
Computer models provide unique insights into the evolution of galaxies, the formation of planets in stellar nebulae, and the analysis of the structure of the early
universe. These are some of the research interests of Professor Benjamin Bromley.
3. Solving the Strong Interactions
Large scale ab initio simulations of quantum chromodynamics, the theory of interacting quarks and gluons, have proven to be an indispensible guide to our
understanding of the masses and structure of the light elementary particles, the
decays of heavy mesons, and the cooling of the quark-gluon plasma, which existed in the early universe. Professor Carleton DeTar is carrying out this work.

2.6 Future Directions
The �eld of Computational Engineering and Science holds rich possibilities for future development. The computational paradigm has taken hold in nearly every area in
science and engineering. Its use is also becoming more common in many �elds outside of science and engineering, such as the social sciences, architecture, business, and
history. Its success hinges on researchers ability and willingness to transcend traditional disciplinary barriers and share expertise and experience with a large group of
colleagues who may have been perceived previously as working in unrelated �elds.
Such boundary-crossing enriches researchers work by providing new computational
opportunities and insights. Building the interdisciplinary spirit will enable the solution
of problems that were previously inaccessible. At the University of Utah, we are excited
by such prospects and have taken the �rst step in initiating a mechanism to educate the
next generation of scientists and engineers.
