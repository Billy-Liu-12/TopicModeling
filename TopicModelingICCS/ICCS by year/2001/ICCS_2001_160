Abstract. We discuss some new approach for derivation of computational algorithms for evolution of quantum systems. The main idea of
the algorithm is to make in functional or path representation of quantum observable the transformation of variables, that makes the phase
of path integral to be quadric functional. Thus the new representation
for observable is reduced to standard multidimensional integral and the
solution, for every point in coordinate space of that integral, of the ﬁrst
order partial diﬀerential equation system. That problem, although still
diﬃcult, can be very eﬀectively parallelyzed. The approach is illustrated
with the help of important example - the scattering in molecular system
with elementary chemical reactions. The use of proposed approach show
substantial speed-up over the standard algorithms and seems to be more
eﬀective with the increase of the size of the problem.

Introduction

Even with increase of the power of computers, used for quantum collision problem analysis nowadays, we do not feel the drastic increase of computational
possibilities, especially when the number of nodes in computations is high. After
some analysis it does not seem so strange since with the increase of number of
parallel computational processes the price, which we pay for exchange of data
between processes, is becoming more and more heavy load, that make the increase of number of nodes ineﬀective. That is why it is very important in deriving
the algorithms to minimize the data exchange between computational processes.
The standard algorithms for quantum scattering calculations are very ineﬀective
for complex systems since in many realistic situations strong coupling between
large amount of interacting states should be taken into account additionally to
nontrivial problems with asymptotic boundary conditions. Among many candidates for alternative approach one of the most promising is the reduction of the
original formulation to Feynman’s path integral. One of the ﬁrsts such eﬀective
algorithms was proposed in 1991 ([1]). But due to some mathematical properties of path integrals this approach could be eﬀectively used only for ﬁnite time
interval evolution calculation. Several attempts were made to overcome those
diﬃculties by describing the evolution in classical terms and solving large time
problems by classical means. A lot of work was done in establishing rigorous

relationship between classical and quantum tools for description of system evolution ([2]). Although formal mathematical solution of the problem was given
in 1979 ([3]), and computational algorithm was proposed in 1986 ([4]), only recently it was possible to realize it on large systems ([5]). The main result of ([3])
was the functional transformation to so called interaction coordinates, that reduces Hamiltonian function of the problem to actually responsible for described
process and reduces integration interval to ﬁnite one, corresponding to interaction region. More than that it transforms asymptotical boundary conditions to
standard ones and makes it possible to get the expression directly to scattering
amplitude as an average over Green’s functions of the problem but in mixed
representation and in interaction coordinates.

With F being the Generator of the transformation. It is convenient to choose F
as a solution of certain equation ([4]) that guarantees the possibility of evaluation of path integral with the weight (2). In that case instead of computation
of path integral we have to solve four times the equation for F , that is more
convenient since it is partial diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst order ([3]). The
resulting amplitude representation is multidimensional integral:

Numerical Method

So in general case computation of scattering amplitude in our approach is reduced to computation of average, i.e. of integral over the coordinate space and
solution for every coordinate of four partial diﬀerential equations of the ﬁrst order for F . It is clear, that such formalism gives an ideal parallel algorithm, since
we can do the solutions of equations for diﬀerent points independently. More,

than that, we can make the same sort of diagonal approximation as in coupled
states approach and choose one average solution for all four generators F . This
is the equivalent of so called average trajectory approximation in semiclassical
approach. Schematically the algorithm of such process computation can be presented in the following way ([6]):
I – Lagrangian surface construction for the system. The curvilinear coordinate
system, within which all the further calculations are performed, is derived in it;
II – Classical trajectory problem solution. At this stage the system of ordinary
non-linear diﬀerential equations of the ﬁrst order is being solved numerically.
The problem’s parameters are collision energy E and quantum numbers of initial conﬁguration n. This system is being solved by one-step method of 4th-5th
order of accuracy. This method is conditionally stable (by initial deviation and
right part), that’s why the standard automatic step decreasing method is implied
to provide its stability. It’s worth mentioning that initial system degenerates in
certain points. To eliminate this degeneration, the standard -procedure with differentiation parameter replacement is performed.
III – The results of classical trajectory problem calculation are used for quantum calculations performing and complete wave function obtaining in its ﬁnal
state. At this stage, the numerical problem represents solution of an ordinary
non-linear diﬀerential equation of the second order. Calculating this equation
is a diﬃcult task due to non-trivial behavior of diﬀerentiation parameter ([7]).
Diﬀerentiation algorithm consists of two stages: 1) construction of diﬀerentiation
parameter values system using the results of classical problem calculation and
2) integration of initial diﬀerential equation on non-uniform system obtained
by means of multi-step method. Choosing such integration step in a classical
problem provides integration stability, while control is performed by means of
step-by-step truncation error calculation. The obtained solution of diﬀerential
equation is approximated in a ﬁnal asymptote in a form of falling and reﬂected
ﬂat wave superposition;
Let’s remind that calculations for steps II and III are made for speciﬁc values
of collision energy E and oscillation quantum number of initial state. Results of
these calculations allow to obtain one line of a transition matrix, which corresponds to n. In order to obtain the entire transition matrix, calculations at stages
II and III need to be repeated as many times as dictated by the size of transitional probability matrix. As a result the entire probability matrix is obtained.
The procedure described needs to be repeated for many values of collision energy
in order to enable further integration and velocity constants ﬁnding. It is clear,
that most time consuming are the stages II and III and that they can be carried
to large extend on independent computational systems, using one of them just to
collect all the results and work out the statistics. Since from each of such computation we need only the value of the kernel of transition functional it was possible
to make exchange of such information as low as possible. All the computations
of the stages IV and V were carried out on MPP system Parsytec CCe-20 of IHPCDB and the individual computations for diﬀerent trajectories on MPP IBM
SP-2 of GMD. We found, that MPP architecture, although old-fashioned, is very

well suited for the architecture of proposed algorithm. The parallelization was
performed for the values of collision energy. Calculation of classical trajectory
problem, quantum calculation and transition probability matrix calculation is
performed in each of the parallel branches. Let’s note that just as in the case on
non-parallelized algorithm all calculations from stages II and III are performed
as many times as it is dictated by the size of transition probability matrix. Due
to the fact that calculation in each of the parallel branches represents a separate
problem and does not interact with other branches in calculation, the eﬀectiveness of using this parallelization algorithm vs. relatively unparallelized algorithm
is nearly proportional to a number of calculation branches, i.e. to the amount of
computation nodes.

Numerical Example

As a reaction on which the algorithm was tested, a well studied bimolecular
reaction Li + (FH) (LiFH)* (LiH) + H was taken. The potential surface for this
reaction was reproduced using the quantum-mechanical calculations carried out
in work ([8]). The results of testing have shown the calculation eﬀectiveness to be
nearly proportional to the number of computation nodes. We have proposed the
variant of our approach for the shared memory systems. However now we have
no technical possibilities to unite in large clusters systems with shared memory
emulation in the regime of NUMA architecture. But this problem solution is one
of the main items in the program of joint activities with GMD in the nearest
years Finally we would like to stress one of the peculiarities of parallelization
algorithms demonstrated - their scalability. Due to the fact that integration of
transition probability matrix and rate constants calculation during stage V requires the values of matrix elements for many energy values, one can hardly ﬁnd
a supercomputer with an excessive number of computation nodes. As illustration (Fig. 1) we show ﬁrst exact converging results of computation of reaction
probability and properties of the system.

Conclusions

We have shown that the use of some physical considerations makes it possible to derive some new algorithms for solution of the evolution equations for
physical variables like wave function. With those algorithms we can reduce the
needed computer time orders of magnitude, go to substantially larger number
of processor and work out approximate methods, which can be used for mass
computations in technical applications. Scalability of these algorithms was used
for conducting distributed computing runs on the supercomputers of GMD and
SARA. Internet possibilities allowed to obtain access for most diﬃcult part of
the problem - trajectories calculations - to the far more powerful computing
resources that are available in IHPCDB, and so to conduct distributed computations in the diﬀerent regimes including X terminal regime. In the future we are
planning to provide in the similar approach the visualization of the numerical

results, data preparations and preliminary tests for remote compilation on the
cluster of workstations Octane and Sun Ultra, available in IHPCDB and sending
them for further processing to the ONYX visualization supercomputers situated
in GMD and SARA. At the same time the proposed approach really make it
possible to get on large scale problems substantial speed-ups over the standard
algorithms.
