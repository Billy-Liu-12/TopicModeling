Abstract. We have analyzed a corpus of human-authored arguments expressed
in text and information graphics, non-pictorial graphics such as bar graphs. The
goal of our research is to enable intelligent argument generation systems to make
effective use of these media. This paper presents and compares two classification
schemes used to analyze the corpus, illustrated by examples from the corpus, and
discusses implications for generation systems.

1 Introduction
In many domains of discourse, arguments employ quantitative data for support.
Frequently, these arguments are expressed in a combination of text, tables of statistics,
and information graphics such as bar graphs. The goal of our research is to enable
intelligent argument generation systems to make effective use of text and information
graphics. Towards this goal we are making an empirical study of the relationship of
information graphics to text in a corpus of arguments. We have analyzed the corpus in
terms of text coherence relations and argumentation strategies. In this paper, we survey
some of the results of our work so far and discuss the implications for argument
generation systems.

2 Related Work
In this section we describe related work in multimedia generation, focusing on issues
relevant to computer generation of arguments in integrated text and information
graphics.
Since the 1980’s research in intelligent multimedia generation systems (IMPS) has
addressed the problem of generating integrated text and graphics [1]. Early systems
that generated text and pictorial graphics (illustrations, diagrams, and maps) identified
several key issues in multimedia generation [2],[3],[4]. The media selection problem is
the problem of selecting use of text or graphics for parts of the presentation. The
simplest approach to media selection is for the choice to be built into the system, e.g.,
by encoding media-specific information into rhetorical strategies. A limitation of this
approach is loss of flexibility and expressiveness. Another key issue, media
coordination, is the problem of coordinating parts of a presentation expressed in
different media. Early work in this area included generating multimodal referring
expressions, references to things in the world made through a combination of natural
language referring expressions and pictorial representations [2],[5]. These approaches
required reasoning about the intended effects of components of the presentation in

different media. A related issue is the problem of detecting and resolving unintended
effects [6].
Other IMPS research addressed the problem of generating natural language captions
for computer-generated information graphics. Information graphics are non-pictorial
graphics such as scatter plots and bar charts [7]. PostGraphe partially automated the
generation of business reports [8]: the user could select a template indicating the main
point of his desired report, e.g., to compare profits of one company to another;
Postgraphe then would search among a set of graphic designs to create a graphic
emphasizing the user’s selected point, and would generate a caption based upon the
selected design and template. Another system, the Caption Generation System [9]
automatically generated captions for information graphics produced by a powerful
automatic graphic design system. The captions were intended to help the user to
interpret a graphic by describing complex aspects of its design and relationships
between the graphic’s elements and the user’s data.
In contrast, the text generated by AutoBrief played a central rather than a supporting
role in achieving the goals of a presentation [10],[11]. AutoBrief generated advisory
presentations on transportation scheduling in integrated text and information graphics.
In the AutoBrief architecture, the first stage of processing was to generate a mediaindependent plan for achieving presentation goals, without specifying how the acts of
the plan would be realized in a particular medium. In the next stage, media selection,
parts of the plan were assigned to the system’s text generator and/or automatic graphic
design component for realization. The AutoBrief architecture enabled the information
graphics to be designed to achieve complex communicative goals. However, although
some types of presentations generated by AutoBrief could be analyzed in terms of
argument strategies, presentation plan structure in AutoBrief did not explicitly represent
this type of knowledge. The need to consider argument strategies in media selection
and media coordination was argued in [12]. Also, a later implementation of the
AutoBrief architecture in a system for generating evaluative arguments explicitly
represented evaluative argument strategies; the representation was used to influence
several aspects of text generation such as lexical choice [13]. The goal of our corpus
analysis is to gain knowledge that can inform the design of future generation systems
such as AutoBrief. Previous corpus studies of multimedia documents [14],[15] focused
on different properties than those that we studied.

3 Corpus
The focus of our corpus analysis is on use of information graphics in arguments
intended for an educated reader who is not necessarily an expert in the domain of
discourse. The present corpus consists of excerpts from the following :
� A report prepared by the U. S. Department of Energy on the topic of global
warming, published as a hypertext document on the world wide web [16],
� Articles on bird census data from several issues of a newsletter for non-scientists,
prepared by a research institution and published as a print quarterly [17],
� A college textbook on software process improvement for undergraduate computer
science students [18].
Excerpts were selected that expressed an argument partly in text and partly through use
of one or more information graphics or maps. We then analyzed the excerpts in two

An Empirical Study of Multimedia Argumentation

1011

ways: first, in terms of coherence relations, and second, in terms of higher-level
argumentation strategies. Since the two approaches led to different insights, we shall
discuss them separately.

4 Analysis of Coherence Relations
The goal of this analysis was to investigate the types of relations between text and
graphics in our corpus as indicated by cross-media cue usage. We define a cross-media
cue as a phrase used to signal explicitly a relationship between some text and a graphic
in the same document, e.g., “Figure 9.4 shows that”, “(Figure 9.4)”, “(See Figure 9.4)”.
Cross-media cues are similar in some respects to discourse cue phrases, connectives
such as ‘although’ that help to convey discourse coherence relations, semantic and
pragmatic relations between units in a coherent text. First, both help the reader to
connect parts of a presentation, although in many cases the reader may be able to infer
the connection. Second, for both types of cue, the same construction may be used to
perform different functions, and the same function may be expressed in different ways.
The expression of cross-media cues may involve use of discourse deixis, use of an
expression that refers to the physical layout of a document, e.g., “the above Figure”
[19]. Also, multimodal referring expressions can be used to indirectly signal a
relationship between text and a graphic. However, we only considered explicit cues.
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) provides a set of coherence relations that can be
used to describe the structure of a monomodal text [20]. According to RST, a common
structural pattern is formed by two adjacent spans of text related by a coherence
relation. One of the spans (the nucleus) is more essential to the writer’s purpose than
the other (the satellite). We found that several RST relations could be used to describe
the relationship between the graphic referred to in a cross-media cue and the rest of the
sentence, provided that the graphic was analyzed as the nucleus of the relation and the
rest of the sentence as the satellite. In the next section, we give examples of the
relations that we found in our corpus, and the definition of the relation (as we adapted it
to describe the multimedia discourse).
4.1 Coherence Relations
Preparation. Text prepares the reader to expect and interpret the graphic. Example:
“Figure 1 on page 3 shows how average numbers of four common species have
changed over the course of Project FeederWatch.”
Restatement. Text restates some or all of the situation expressed in the graphic.
Example: “In the United States, nearly 85 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions result from the burning of fossil fuels (Figure 3).” The figure contains a pie
chart in which the slice denoting the contribution from the United States is labelled
“85%”.
Summary. Text summarizes multiple pieces of information expressed in the graphic.
There were two varieties of summary in the corpus. In the first example, the text makes
a generalization about a subset of the data shown in the graphic, and in the second

1012

N. Green

example, the text expresses an arithmetic summarization of the raw data shown.
Examples: “From Fig. 9.5, you can see that the numbers of test defects are much lower
in the later programs.”, “Current projections show U.S. emissions increasing by 1.2
percent annually between 1995 and 2015 absent any policy interventions (see Figure
4).”
Evaluation. Text provides an evaluation of the situation conveyed by the graphic.
Example: “In particular, anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions have increased
dramatically … (Figure 1)”
Elaboration. Text provides additional information about the data not given in the
graphic. Example: “These data, shown in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2, are for the times to both
find and fix these defects.”
4.2 Discussion
This analysis shows a variety of relations between text and graphic that can be signaled
by cross-media cue usage. However, it raises some issues for natural language
generation. In general, what makes a multimedia document coherent? For example,
are the relations between cross-media cue and graphic constrained by the coherence
relations between spans of text in the document? Are there any relations needed to
characterize multimedia discourse coherence that are not needed for monomodal text?
We assume that these questions are relevant to argument generation, i.e., that in order to
be effective, the presentation of an argument must be coherent. Another question is
what factors determine where to place a cross-media cue?
An overly simplistic
approach might be to add a cross-media cue whenever a graphic stands in one of the
above relations to the text. However, this approach is not sufficient when more than
one unit in the text is related to the same graphic. In many cases, a graphic is relevant
to more than one sentence. To address this problem, it is necessary to analyze the
higher-level organization of the text, which is addressed in the next section.

5 Analysis of Argument Strategies
The goal of this analysis was to investigate the roles of text and graphics in argument
strategies. We examined the corpus for instances of strategies described in a textbook
on writing effective arguments [21]. The results can be summarized as follows:
1. A single graphic can be designed to convey more than one part of the same
argument strategy, or to convey parts of several strategies.
2. The same part of an argument strategy may be expressed in both text and graphics.
3. In addition to bearing the argument proper, text in the body of a document may be
what we shall call commentary-bearing rather than argument-bearing. The former
category includes comment on
� a graphic’s role in the argument, by means of cross-media cues;
� the location of the graphic in the document, by means of discourse deixis;
� correspondences between graphical elements and database elements, e.g., the
type of data shown in a graph; and

1013

�

salient visual features of the graphic, e.g., a sharp change in slope of a line in a
line graph.
Placement of this commentary-bearing text may be interleaved with argumentbearing text. Furthermore, cross-media cues may occupy sites that would otherwise
be available for discourse cue phrase placement.
Intuitively, use of a graphic can add to some dimensions of a presentation’s
effectiveness, e.g., comprehensibility, memorability, or persuasiveness. (There is
some support for these intuitions from cognitive psychology also.)

5.1 Argumentation Strategies
We now present detailed examples from the corpus to provide evidence for these
observations. Excerpts are given in tabular format. The excerpt is shown in the order
in which it appears in the source. The third column contains notes from our analysis.
In the third column, -> and //> denote supports and refutes, respectively; C denotes
commentary and G the graphic referred to in the text. Each table is accompanied by a
figure with a schematic of the design of any relevant graphics in the source.
Addressing the Counterargument. The text shown in Table 1 makes use of this
stragegy in units (5-7). Support is provided for a claim (5) by acknowledging (6) and
refuting (7) a possible counterargument (not explicitly stated in the text; denoted by
ctr(5) in the table). Both of the graphics in the source have the schematic form shown
in Figure 1. They express the argument given in units (5-7); they show data supporting
both (6) and (7), but (7) is emphasized over (6) by graphic design and layout. The
design emphasizes Phase over Defect Type by encoding Phase by position on the x-axis
for each cluster of bars and Defect Type by shading. The layout emphasizes Phase over
Language by presenting data for each language in a separate graphic on different pages.
Finally, note that a cross-media cue placement algorithm based only coherence relations
between text and graphics would overgenerate; it would generate the same cue for each
of (5), (6), and (7), since each provides a summary of data in the two graphics.

defect identification costs are highest during test and use.
Thus anyone who seeks to reduce development cost or time should
focus on preventing or removing defects before starting test.
This conclusion is reinforced by the PSP data on the fix times for
664 C++ defects and 1377 Pascal defects …
These data, shown in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2, are for the times to both
find and fix these defects.
Fix times are clearly much longer during test and use than in the
earlier phases.
While this pattern varies somewhat between the two languages and
by defect type,
the principal factor determining defect fix time is the phase in
which the defect was found.

Arguing for a Causal Relation by Showing Correlation (first example). The text
shown in Table 2 makes use of this strategy in units (1-6). The main claim, that
something (4) caused a changing situation (1) during a certain time span (2), is
supported by claiming that there was a proportional change in a related condition (5)
over the same time span (6). The graphic has the schematic form shown in Figure 2. It
shows data supporting both the claim in units (1-2) and units (5-6). In addition, the
temporal correlation of (1) and (5) is shown by plotting the two sets of data against the
same x-axis, which encodes time. The evaluation that anthropogenic emissions
“increased dramatically” is reinforced by the steep rise in the line representing
emissions.

Atmospheric concentrations of several important greenhouse gases

since large-scale industrialization began some 150 years ago.
The growth in their concentrations is believed to be caused by
human (anthropogenic) activity.
In particular, anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions have

Arguing for a Causal Relation by Showing Correlation (second example). The text
shown in Table 3 makes use of this stragegy in units (1-5), although it uses a graphic in
a different way than shown in the preceding example. The main claim is a yes-answer
to the rhetorical question (1). It is supported by claiming that a trend described in (2)

has features described in (4) that are correlated with events described in (5). (In
addition, the trend in (2) is contrasted with the trend in (3) to show that winter weather
affects northern wren populations differently than southern wren populations.) The
graphic has the schematic form shown in Figure 3. It shows the trends in (2) and (3).
The temporal correlation of features (4) of the trend in (2) with events in (5) is shown
by annotating the peaks in the line denoting N.E. population with arrows and labels
denoting the events (“snowstorms”).

Excerpt
Did the bitter cold and frequent snowstorms this past winter
take a similar toll on wrens in the Northeast?
We examined the weekly FeederWatch counts and noted that,
in the Northeast Region, Carolina Wrens visited fewer and
fewer feeders as the season progressed,
although they didn’t follow this pattern in the Southeast region
(Figure 7).
The Northeast decline came after a sharp peak in visitation
during the week of January 8-14.
This period corresponded with a severe storm that dropped at
least three feet of snow over most of the Northeast and glazed
much of the Southeast with ice.

Inductive Generalization. The text shown in Table 4 makes use of this strategy more
than once in units (1-5). A previous inductive generalization (1) was based on limited
data described in (3). However, new data described in (4) falsify (1). Together, the old
and new data support a new inductive generalization (2). Both graphics for the two
whale species have the schematic form shown in Figure 4. The leftmost bar chart

Excerpt
During the first year that BRP studied the world’s two largest whale
species (blue and finback whales), our data suggested that they sang
only at certain times.
As it turns out, these species are vocally active all year round.
Initially, we monitored the region between Newfoundland and the
Caribbean margin. There, we detected the most whale calls during
the six-month-long winter breeding season.
More recently, however, we’ve recorded blue whales in the northeast
Atlantic and we hear few or no calls in the winter there. Instead, the
number of calls increases through late spring, peaks in late summer,
and then decreases again in the fall – almost a mirror-image of the
pattern farther to the south and west (Figure 1, top).
Finback sounds follow a similar pattern (Figure 1, bottom).

Falsification of Hypothesis of Sufficient Cause. The text shown in Table 5 makes use
of this stragegy in units (2-3) to argue that a condition (2) is not a sufficient cause of a
situation described in (3) by claiming that the condition was present but that the
situation did not occur. The graphic has the schematic form shown in Figure 5; the

bottom half of the figure, labeled Figure 3b shows data supporting the claim that the
situation did not occur. Although the top half of the figure, labeled Figure 3a, is used
with (4) as part of another argument strategy (addressing a possible counterargument),
by juxtaposing it with Figure 3b the author enables the reader to see a striking visual
contrast in the shape of the lines in the two graphics. Intuitively, seeing the two
together helps to persuade the audience that (3) is an accurate interpretation of the data
shown in Figure 3b.

5.2 Discussion
This analysis has important implications for multimedia argument generation
architectures. The influence of argument strategy can be seen in both text and graphics
in the corpus. Thus, in a multimedia generation architecture such as described above, it
would make sense to represent argument strategies in the media-independent plan
explicitly. For example, this would enable media selection and graphic design
processes to be informed by the underlying argument strategy. Second, we showed
that the text serves two kinds of functions: to advance the argument proper and to help
the reader to interpret a graphic and recognize its intended contribution to the argument.
This suggests adding a post-graphic-design text-only planning phase to the architecture.
This phase would be responsible for planning commentary-bearing acts (including
cross-media cues) and integrating them with the already-planned argument-bearing acts
previously allocated to text.
