Abstract. We use computer simulation to study the eﬀect of surfactants
on a drop spreading on a solid surface. Surfactants enhance spreading, especially when the hydrophobic head of the surfactant molecule is strongly
attracted to the solid. A signiﬁcant part of the spreading is due to the
“shielding” of the surface by the surfactant. We use a novel boundary
condition that reduces the simulation time by a factor of two.

Introduction

It is an experimental fact that certain surfactants facilitate the spreading of
drops on solid surfaces. For certain combinations of surfactants, the increase in
spreading is truly signiﬁcant [1]. We investigate this phenomena using molecular
dynamics simulations.
Surfactants could enhance spreading through two mechanisms [2]. First of all,
surfactants reduce the surface tension, causing the drop to spread out. A second
mechanism is possible if, for example, a drop of water is placed on a greasy
surface. A surfactant, such as soap, with a hydrophobic and and a hydrophilic
end could interpose itself between the water and the surface, thus shielding the
water from the surface. The drop would the spread more easily for the repulsive
interactions between the ﬂuid and the surface would be reduced. In this paper,
we emphasize the second “shielding” mechanism and show that it is important.
In this paper, we perform several computer “experiments” where a drop is
placed on a solid surface, and allowed to spread. We ﬁrst examine the case without surfactants. The ﬁnal state of the drop depends delicately on the interaction
between the liquid and the solid. We then ﬁx the liquid-solid interaction and
experiment with diﬀerent surfactants, looking for the surfactants which enhance
the spreading the most. There are many diﬀerent parameters, so this paper does
not come close to exhausting the possibilities. We investigate three diﬀerent

parameters: the relative sizes of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts, the solubility of the surfactant and the surfactant-solid interaction. This last parameter
is the most signiﬁcant.

The Experiment
Materials

In our experiments, a drop containing surfactants is placed on a solid surface.
Our implementation of surfactants [3] and spreading [4] follows previous work.
We deﬁne four diﬀerent types of atoms named A, B, C, and D. All the necessary
components are made of these molecules. A sketch of these components is shown
in Fig. 1. The ﬂuid is composed of A2 : dimers of atoms of type A. We use dimers
instead of monomers because dimers are less volatile. The surfactant has the
general form Bm Cn . It must be composed of two types of atoms because it has
a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end. The hydrophilic end is composed of
atoms of type B and the hydrophobic end is made of atoms of type C. We will
use the terms “hydrophobic” and “hydrophilic” to refer to the two ends of the
polymers, even though we do not attempt to make the liquid A2 mimic water.
(Perhaps more appropriate names would be “A-philic” and “A-phobic”.) Finally,
the solid is composed of atoms of type D.

The potential between all the atoms is built out of the Lennard-Jones potential [5]:

Here � is the unit of energy, and σ is the eﬀective diameter of the atoms. The
potential consists of two parts: a strong short-range repulsion (proportional to
r−12 ), and a longer range attractive potential (proportional to r −6 ). We have
added the factor Cαβ which depends on the species of the interacting atoms.
By changing Cαβ , one can increase or decrease the attractive force between the

molecules. In this paper, CAA = 1, so VLJ reduces to the traditional LennardJones potential. We create hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials by setting
CAB > 1 and CAC < 1. CAD controls the behavior of the liquid on the surface.
Roughly speaking, CAD < 1 gives a liquid which is partially wetting, and CAD >
1 gives a wetting liquid. When CAD is much larger than 1, terraced spreading is
observed.[4]
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the interaction coeﬃcients Cαβ have the following
values: CAB = 2 and CAC = 0, so that the hydrophilic end is very hydrophilic
indeed; it attracts ﬂuid atoms more strongly than the ﬂuid atoms attract one
another. But between the hydrophobic end and the ﬂuid atoms, there is no
long range (r −6 ) force, only a short range repulsion. Within the surfact, we set
CBB = 1 and CBC = CCC = 0. Between the solid and the surfactant we have
CBD = 0 and CCD = 1. Thus the hydrophobic end of the surfactant is attracted
to the solid.
The interaction potential in (1) extends to inﬁnity, which means that every
particle directly inﬂuences every other particle. In order to solve for the motion
of N particles, we would have to calculate N 2 /2 interactions, which is too expensive. Therefore, we will “cut” the potential at a cutoﬀ radius rc , and set U = 0
for r > rc . In this paper, we choose rc = 2.5σ. We also “shift” the potential so
that energy and force are continuous at r = rc . The potential becomes
�
�
VLJ (r) − VLJ
(rc )r − VLJ (rc ), r < rc
V (r) =
(2)
0,
r ≥ rc .
Note that “cutting” and “shifting” the potential changes the properties of the
ﬂuid. One must take care when comparing results, because some people shift the
potential in diﬀerent ways, or do not shift it at all. Our method of shifting the
potential minimizes integration errors.
Neighboring atoms in molecules do not interact via (2), rather they are
bonded together by

Note that the −6 power has been replaced with a +6. This means that inﬁnite energy is required to break bonds. The −12 power again keeps the atoms
separated.

sites. The D atoms feel a force F given by

The spring constant K is set to 50 in this paper. The mass of the D atoms is
set to 50 so that its resonant frequency will be of order 1. The other atoms have
mass 1.

Geometry

As shown in Fig. 2, we will consider the spreading of a cylindrical drops on a ﬂat
surface. The surface is a plane perpendicular to the z axis, and the drops axis
is parallel to the y axis. The experiment is macroscopically uniform along the y
axis. The boundary conditions match this assumption by imposing periodicity
in the y direction. In all other directions, a force ﬁeld prevents particles from
escaping from the box. In our experiments, we choose Lx = 140σ, Ly = 12σ and
Lz = 60σ.

escaping.

In Fig. 3, we show the result of two spreading experiments: one where CAD =
0.8 and another where CAD = 1. A small change in CAD gives a big change
in spreading behavior. When we study surfactants, we will add them to the
CAD = 0.8 ﬂuid, to try to get it to spread like the CAD = 1 ﬂuid.
Note that the simulations of Fig. 3 have approximate mirror symmetry. We
would like to exploit this symmetry to simulate only one half of the spreading
drop. To do this, we cut the simulation in half at the midplane, and simulate
only the left half, as shown in Fig. 4a. At the midplane, we impose a special kind
of mirror image boundary conditions. It turns out that the simplest possible
mirror image boundary conditions, where a particle at (x, y, z) has an image at
(Lx − x, y, z) does not work. The reason is that when a particle approaches the
mirror, it always sees its own image approaching from the other side, and it is
repelled by that image. This interaction prevents a half-drop from adhering to
its image. What is needed is the “shifted mirror” boundary conditions shown in
Fig. 4b, where a particle’s image(s) are shifted by Ly /2. In this way, a particle
never interacts directly with its own image, and a cluster of particles placed near
the mirror boundary spontaneously forms a half drop.

In Fig. 5, we compare the results of simulations shown in Fig. 3 with two
equivalent simulations using the shifted mirror boundary conditions. The results
show that, within ﬂuctuations, the two boundary conditions are equivalent. All
the rest of the simulations presented in this paper use shifted mirror boundary
conditions, since they run twice as fast as full simulations.

the distance from the edge of the drop to its midpoint. IT is measured by inspecting
the density of ﬂuid atoms just above the solid surface.

The Eﬀect of Surfactants

We next consider the eﬀect of surfactant composition on spreading. A half drop
of 4500 molecules of A2 ﬂuid was prepared and 90 molecules of C3 B3 , C2 B4
or CB5 were added. We placed each drop on a solid surface, and measured its
spreading. In Fig. 6a, we compare the results against pure ﬂuid drops with the
same mass (4770 molecules of A2 ). The surfactants do enhance the spreading, but
not by much. Furthermore, it is not clear which surfactant works best. Looking
at a snapshot of the simulation, we see that the surfactants are concentrated
both at the free surface and at the solid-liquid interface, as shown in Fig. 6b.
The surfactants do partially shield the solvent from the surface, but they
also interpose the hydrophobic heads between the solvent and the surface. The

Fig. 6. a) Comparison of diﬀerent surfactants. The thin lines give pure ﬂuid spreading
for two diﬀerent values of CAD . The surfactant drops have CAD = 0.8; the presence
of surfactants does enhance spreading, but not as much as increasing C AD to 1. The
interaction coeﬃcients are as given in Sec. 2.1: CAA = CBB = CDD = CCD = 1,
CAC = CBD = CCC = 0, and CAB = 2. b) A magniﬁed view of the edge of the

presence of the hydrophobic heads at the liquid-solid boundary reduces spreading
because the hydrophobic heads repel the liquid.
Making the surfactant head less hydrophobic might improve the spreading,
because the hydrophobic heads at the solid-liquid boundary would be less repulsive to the liquid. We changed the ﬂuid-surfactant interaction parameters
to CAC = 0.5 and CAB = 1.5, but left all the others unchanged. As a result,
the surfactant becomes soluble, that is, it is not conﬁned to the exterior of the
drop, and some molecules are present in the interior. However, the majority of
the surfactant molecules remain at the surface. The comparison of the soluble
and insoluble C2 B4 surfactant is shown in Fig. 7. As one can see, the soluble
surfactant is not more successful than the insoluble one.
The failure of the soluble surfactants to further enhance spreading casts doubt
on the “shielding” mechanism. A surfactant must have a hydrophobic part, and
this part must always be trapped between the ﬂuid and the solid. If the hydrophobic heads prevent successful spreading even when they are only mildly
hydrophobic, it is diﬃcult to see how any surfactant will increase spreading. But
if the attraction between the hydrophobic part of the surfactant and the solid
surface is increased, the spreading increases remarkably, as shown in Fig. 8.
In Fig. 8b, we see the reason for this surprising behavior: the hydrophobic
head penetrate into the solid surface. In this way, they are hidden from the ﬂuid
atoms, and the spreading of the drop is much enhanced.
Note that the increased spreading is due to the shielding mechanism, not
to a reduction in surface tension. The ﬂuid-surfactant interaction has been left

unchanged, so tension of the free surface will not change. (If anything, the surface
tension will increase, because the concentration of surfactant molecules there is
lower in Fig. 8b than in Fig. 6b.) We have therefore demonstrated that the
shielding mechanism is active.

Conclusions

We have studied spreading drops using molecular dynamics simulations. We
have presented novel boundary conditions which permit us to double the size
of the studied drop. We also showed that surfactants enhance spreading. The
performance of most surfactants is limited by the fact that the hydrophobic
head becomes trapped between the solid and the liquid. Since the hydrophobic
head repels the liquid, the liquid soon stops spreading. However, if the attraction
between the hydrophobic head and the solid is strong enough, the hydrophobic
head buries itself into the solid, thus hiding itself from the liquid, and spreading
is greatly enhanced.
Our work suggests that the “shielding” spreading mechanism can be important, if the hydrophobic heads can be hidden from the ﬂuid. In our case, this is
acheived by hiding the heads in the solid itself. But more realistic molecules could
hide the heads by other mechanisms, such as an orderly array of surfactants at
the solid-liquid boundary.
