Abstract. We show that advances in two ﬁelds of computational chemistry, Dynamic
Monte Carlo simulations and Density-Functional Theory calculations, are now making
it possible to do ab-initio kinetics of realistic surface reactions. We present results of
simulations of Temperature- Programmed Desorption experiments of NO reduction to
N2 and O2 on the Rh(111) surface. Kinetic parameters were obtained from DensityFunctional Theory calculations with the Generalized Gradient Approximation, making
this one of the ﬁrst, and up till now the most complex, example of ab-initio kinetics
in heterogeneous catalysis. Top, hcp, and fcc sites are all involved and also lateral
interactions are necessary to understand the kinetics of this system.

Introduction

Although kinetics plays such an important role in catalysis, its theory has for a
long time mainly been restricted to macroscopic rate equations. These implicitly assume a random distribution of adsorbates on a catalyst’s surface. Eﬀects
of interactions between adsorbates (lateral interactions), reactant segregation,
site blocking, and defects have only been described ad hoc. With the advent of
Dynamic Monte-Carlo (DMC) simulations, also called Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations, it has only recently become possible to follow the kinetics of reaction
systems on an atomic scale, and thus to study these eﬀects properly.
Two developments have played a major role in the advance of DMC. One is
the derivation of a Master Equation (ME) on which DMC can be based, and
which has kinetic parameters that can be calculated with ab-initio quantum
chemical methods.[1] This ME links the processes on an atomic scale to the
macroscopic kinetics. The other is the development of new and the improvement
of existing DMC algorithms and ways of modeling reaction systems,[2,3,4] and
the implementation of the algorithms in the general-purpose code CARLOS that
allows a user to simulate almost any system of surface reactions.[5] Lateral interactions, steps, and other defects can now easily be included, whereas reactant
segregation and site blocking can often be seen in simulations as a consequence
of the reaction model.

DMC simulations need as input the kinetic parameters of the ME. For simulations of real systems these must either be obtained from experiments or be
calculated. In many cases it has proved to be very hard to get all parameters
from experiments. In particular lateral interactions are diﬃcult to derive from
experimental data. Here another computational advance has shown itself to be
very important. Lateral interaction, and also other kinetic parameters, may be
obtained from quantum chemical calculations. In particular Density-Functional
Theory (DFT) with the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) has been
shown to give quite accurate results.[6]
In this paper we show results for the reduction of NO (2NO → N2 + O2 ) on
a Rh(111) surface using DMC simulations with kinetic parameters which are to
a large extent calculated with DFT-GGA. This system is important for exhaust
gas catalysis. Not only are lateral interactions present in this system, but also
three diﬀerent adsorption sites are involved. We think that this is currently the
most complex system for which ab-initio kinetics has been done.

Computational Details

In this section we brieﬂy discuss the theory of DMC and DFT, and we present
the reaction models that we have used.
2.1

Dynamic Monte Carlo Simulations

Three parts can be distinguished in our DMC method: the model representing
the catalyst and the adsorbates, the ME that describes the evolution of the
system, and the DMC algorithms to solve the ME. The ME is given by[1,7]
�

[Wαβ Pβ − Wβα Pα ] ,

(1)

β

where α and β refer to the conﬁguration of the adlayer, the P ’s are the probabilities of the conﬁgurations, t is real time, and the W ’s are transition probabilities
per unit time. These transition probabilities give the rates with which reactions
change the occupations of the sites. They are very similar to macroscopic reaction rate constants and we will use this term in the rest of this paper, although
one should remember that they refer to reactions at the atomic scale. Wαβ corresponds to the reaction that changes β into α. A conﬁguration is the assignment
of the adsorbates to the sites in the system.
The derivation of the ME shows that the rate constants can be written as

with kB the Boltzmann-constant, h Planck’s constant, T temperature, and Ebar

functions of the transition state and the reactants, respectively, although there
are some small, generally negligible, diﬀerences.[1] The important point is that
this equation makes an ab-initio approach to kinetics possible.
The DMC simulations form a powerful numerical method to solve the ME
exactly. In fact there are numerous DMC algorithms that might be used: a recent
taxonomy of these algorithms contained no less than 48.[4] Most of them are not
eﬃcient for any reaction system, however. For a general ME various algorithms
have been given by Binder.[8] (Note, however, that here the ME exists before
the DMC algorithms, whereas in equilibrium MC it is the other way around. As
a consequence t is real time, and not some time in MC steps.) DMC algorithms
for rate equations have even been given earlier by Gillespie.[9,10] For latticegas systems the algorithms given by Binder and Gillespie can be made much
more eﬃcient, and also other algorithms can be used.[2,3,4] All DMC algorithms
generate an ordered list of times at which a reaction takes place, and for each time
in that list the reaction that occurs at that time. A DMC simulation starts with
a chosen initial conﬁguration. The list is traversed and changes are made to the
conﬁguration corresponding to the occurring reactions. The various algorithms
diﬀer in how the reaction times are computed, how a reaction of a particular
type is chosen, and how it is determined where on the surface a reaction takes
place.
2.2

Density-Functional Theory Calculations of Kinetic Parameters

DFT calculations have become very popular for doing quantum chemistry, as
DFT forms a good combination of eﬃciency and accuracy.[6] We have done DFT
calculations with the VASP code.[11,12] This code solves the Kohn-Sham equations with a plane wave basis set and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials introduced
by Vanderbilt and generated by Kresse and Hafner.[13,14] The Generalized Gradient Approximation of Perdew and Wang has been used (DFT-GGA), because
it generally yields good bond energies.[15] The calculations were done with an
energy cut-oﬀ of 400 eV for the basis, k-point sampling of 5 × 5 × 1, and a surface
model consisting of a supercell with a slab of ﬁve metal layers separated by a
vacuum of 13.4 Å. The supercells used have a 2 × 2, 3 × 3, or a c(2 × 4) structure
and various combinations of NO, N, and O.[16,17] Adsorbates were put on both
sides of the slab so that the system was inversion symmetric, avoiding dipoledipole interactions between the slabs. The calculations were converged to within
5 kJ.mol−1 for the adsorption energy. The calculations allowed us to calculate
the lateral interactions for adsorbates on the following combinations of sites:
neighboring top sites, neighboring fcc sites, neighboring hcp sites, an fcc site
and the next-nearest top site, an fcc site and the next-nearest hcp site, an hcp
site and the next-nearest top site, an hcp site and the next-nearest fcc site, and
a top site and the next-nearest fcc and hcp sites (see ﬁgure 1). The interactions
between adsorbates on a top site and the nearest fcc and hcp sites, and between
nearest fcc and hcp sites are very strongly repulsive. These interactions have not
been calculated, and we have assumed that adsorbates will never occupy these
pairs of sites at the same time.

interactions between adsorbates that get closer are extremely repulsive, and the simulations do not allow such close approaches. In the 1-site model only hcp sites (or only
fcc sites) are used.

The Reaction Models

NO, atomic nitrogen, and atomic oxygen all prefer threefold adsorption sites
(see ﬁgure 1). As a ﬁrst model, the 1-site model, we have assumed that there
is only one threefold site (either the fcc or the hcp) relevant for the kinetics.
We have simulated the Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) of NO on
Rh(111). In a TPD experiment an adsorbate, in our case NO, is deposited on a
catalyst at a low temperature at which no reactions occur. Then the temperature
is raised and the rate of desorption is measured. A peak in the desorption rate is
generally interpreted as desorption from a particular type of site: the temperature
of the peak depends on the bonding energy. Reactions on the surface and lateral
interactions can complicate the interpretation of TPD spectra enormously.
The reactions that can occur in our model of the TPD experiment are
NO(ads) + ∗ → N(ads) + O(ads),
NO(ads) → NO(gas) + ∗,
2N(ads) → N2 (gas) + 2∗,

(3)
(4)
(5)

where ∗ stands for a vacant site. The two sites involved in all reactions, except for
the NO desorption, are nearest neighbors. There is no O2 desorption in our model
because this takes place at much higher temperatures than the other reactions.
NO dissociation is suppressed at high coverages, because of site blocking: i.e., it
needs a neighboring vacant site, which may not be present. There is an additional
suppression due to lateral interaction, which also inﬂuence the other reactions.
We have included lateral interactions through the Polanyi-Brønsted relation for
the activation barrier:[18]
(0)

Ebar = Ebar + α(ΔΦproduct − ΔΦreactant ),
(0)

(6)

were Ebar is the activation barrier without lateral interactions, and ΔΦ product
(ΔΦreactant ) is the change in adsorption energy of the products (reactants) due
to lateral interactions. The coeﬃcient α is the Brønsted-coeﬃcient. It was taken
equal to 1 for all reactions (late barrier) except for diﬀusion for which we used
α = 1/2. We have assumed that the lateral interactions are pairwise additive:
ΔΦproduct and ΔΦreactant are simply the sums of pair interactions. DFT calculations gave no indications that this is incorrect. Only lateral interactions with
nearest neighbors were included in the 1-site model. Using realistic diﬀusion
rate constants would make the simulations too costly. The rate constants that
we have used (see table 1) are ﬁve to eight orders of magnitude smaller than
the real ones. However the changes in the results when the rate constants for
diﬀusion are increased are negligible.
In the 3-site model we included both threefold sites (fcc and hcp) and the
onefold (top) site in the unit cell. The reason for this more complex model was not
based on the kinetic results of the simulations with the 1-site model, but on the
discrepancy for the lateral interactions between the DFT calculations and ﬁtted
values with the 1-site model (see below). Also a LEED study of NO/Rh(111)

with high coverage indicates that NO can be distributed over three sites in our
3-site model.[19] The reactions are the same as for the 1-site model, but, as we
have more sites, we have more diﬀerent lateral interactions.

Results and Discussion

The results of the DMC simulations obtained with the 1-site model are in reasonable agreement with the experiment. The kinetic parameters are obtained by
ﬁtting to the experimental data. For some parameters this is quite straightforward. For example, the activation energy and the prefactor for N2 desorption
can be obtained from a TPD experiment starting with a low coverage layer of
nitrogen that has been atomically deposited.[20] The low coverage is necessary
to avoid eﬀects of lateral interactions. Similarly the activation energies and prefactors for NO dissociation can be obtained. It’s much harder to obtain kinetic
parameters for the NO desorption, because this only occurs when many other
adsorbates are present. These adsorbates block the sites necessary for the NO
dissociation which would otherwise occur. Their lateral interactions inﬂuence,
however, the NO desorption. It is also very hard to obtain the lateral interactions themselves from experiments. We have determined these parameters by
varying them, by hand, and by ﬁtting the simulated TPD spectra to the experimental ones. There are two problems with the kinetic parameters for the
1-site model. First the TPD experiments do not seem to contain enough data to
determine the lateral interactions uniquely. Various sets of them were obtained
by diﬀerent people which gave ﬁts of similar quality. Second, there is a huge discrepancy with DFT results: DFT gives values for the same lateral interactions
that are almost an order of magnitude larger than what is obtained from ﬁtting to the TPD spectra. Using the DFT results in the 1-site model gave totally
incorrect spectra.
We have extended the 1-site model to the 3-site model to resolve the discrepancy between the ﬁtted and the calculated lateral interactions (see ﬁgure 2).

TPD, but another technique is necessary to measure the NO dissociation. The top-left

with the 1- and the 3-site model is that in the 3-site model the adsorbates can
stay farther apart at high coverages. Consequently the system avoids almost
completely lateral interactions for which the DFT calculations give high values.
Occasionally adsorbates do get as close to each other as in the 1-site model,
but only when it’s necessary for restructuring the adlayer. These high lateral
interactions do not show up in the TPD spectra. The lateral interactions and
other kinetic parameters are given in tables 1 and 2.

sites doe not occur due to the low adsorption energy at top sites.)

The maximum coverage of NO (i.e., the maximum number of NO molecules
on the surface per Rh atom in the top layer of the catalyst) is 0.75. The partial
occupation of sites of the same type indicates that there are repulsive lateral
interactions. In the 3-site model the coverage θNO = 0.75 corresponds to the
(2 × 2) − 3NO structure in which a quarter of each of the top, hcp, and fcc sites
are occupied. In this structure the NO molecules feel only the weak repulsive
interaction. Putting more NO molecules on the catalyst immediately leads to
strong repulsive interactions (see ﬁgure 1). In the 1-site model there is only a
gradual increase in the lateral interaction energy with coverage, and it’s not clear
in this model why the maximum coverage should be 0.75.
Dissociation of isolated NO is a fast reaction. As the dissociation products, N
and O, need one extra site, the dissociation will not occur, however, when sites
are blocked or when lateral interactions increase the activation barrier too much.
In that case NO dissociation will only occur after the slower NO desorption has
made suﬃcient room on the catalyst’s surface. Figure 2 shows that the NO
molecules at the top sites desorb ﬁrst. They are bound less strongly to the
surface. This does not lead to sites useful for NO dissociation yet. Only when
NO molecules vacate hcp and fcc sites NO dissociation begins.
At a slightly higher temperature N2 desorption also starts taking place. The
N2 desorption takes place over a very broad temperature range and the peak at
the beginning of that range is also caused by lateral interactions. The diﬀerence
in lateral interactions between NO, N, and O causes segregation into NO and
N + O islands. O2 desorption only occurs at much higher temperatures and is
not shown in ﬁgure 2.

Conclusions

We have done DMC simulations of the NO reduction to N2 and O2 on Rh(111)
with kinetic parameters obtained from DFT calculations. Our 3-site model has
three diﬀerent sites per unit cell, site blocking, and lateral interactions for all
reactions and for diﬀusion. The DMC simulations gave results for real time
dependence and used exact reaction rate constants for simulating TPD spectra. The DFT calculations were done with a plane wave basis set and ultrasoft
pseudo-potentials on a ﬁve-layer slab and supercells up to 3 × 3 structures.
The present study shows the necessity of DMC simulations with DFT calculations to understand kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis. A 1-site model shows
that it’s well possible to reproduce the experimental kinetics, but that this does
not mean that the model is correct. Only the comparison between ﬁtted and calculated kinetic parameters shows the shortcomings of this too simple model. The
results of the 3-site model with kinetic parameters obtained from DFT calculations indicates that it is becoming possible to do ab-initio kinetics for real-world
applications.
