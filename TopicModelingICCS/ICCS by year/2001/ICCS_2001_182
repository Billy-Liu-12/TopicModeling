Abstract. The results of analytical approximations and extensive calculations based on a path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) scheme are presented. A new (direct) PIMC method allows for a correct determination
of thermodynamic properties such as energy and equation of state of
dense degenerate Coulomb systems. In this paper, we present results
for dense partially ionized hydrogen at intermediate and high temperature. We give a quantitative comparison with the available results of
alternative (restricted) PIMC simulations and with analytical expressions based on iterpolation formulas meeting the exact limits at low and
high densities. Good agreement between the two simulations is found up
to densities of the order of 1024 cm−3 . The agreement with the analytical
results is satisfactory up to densities in the range 1022 . . . 1023 cm−3 .

Introduction

Correlated Fermi systems are of increasing interest in many ﬁelds, including
plasmas, astrophysics, solids and nuclear matter, (see Kraeft et al. 1986) for an
overview. Among the topics of current interest are Fermi liquids, metallic hydrogen (see DaSilva et al. 1997), plasma phase transition (see Schlanges et al.
1995), bound states etc. In such many particle quantum systems, the Coulomb
interaction is essential. There has been signiﬁcant progress in recent years to
study these systems theoretically, and especially numerically, (see e.g. Bonitz
(Ed.) 2000, Zamalin et al. 1977, Filinov, A. V. et al. 2000). A theoretical framework which is particularly well suited to describe thermodynamic properties
in the region of strong coupling and degeneracy is the path integral quantum
Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. There has been remarkable recent progress in
applying these techniques to Fermi systems. However, these simulations are essentially hampered by the fermion sign problem. To overcome this diﬃculty,
several strategies have been developed to simulate macroscopic Coulomb systems (see Militzer and Pollock 2000, Militzer and Ceperley 2000, and Militzer
V.N. Alexandrov et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2001, LNCS 2073, pp. 1272–1281, 2001.

2000): the ﬁrst is the restricted PIMC concept where additional assumptions on
the density operator ρ̂ are introduced which reduce the sum over permutations
to even (positive) contributions only. This requires the knowledge of the nodes
of the density matrix which is available only in a few special cases. However,
for interacting macroscopic systems, these nodes are known only approximately,
(see, e.g., Militzer and Pollock 2000 and Militzer and Ceperley 2000), and the
accuracy of the results is diﬃcult to assess from within this scheme.
Recently, we have published a new path integral representation for the Nparticle density operator (see Filinov, V. S., et al. 2000, Bonitz (Ed.) 2000,
Filinov, V. S., et al. 2001), which allows for direct Fermionic path integral Monte
Carlo simulations of dense plasmas in a broad range of densities and temperatures. Using this concept we computed the pressure (equation of state, EOS),
the energy, and the pair distribution functions of a dense partially ionized and
dissociated electron–proten plasma (see Filinov, V. S., et al. 2000). In this region no reliable data are available from other theories such as density functional
theory or quantum statistics (see, e.g., Kraeft et al. 1986), which would allow
for an unambiguous test. Therefore, it is of high interest to perform quantitative
comparisons of analytical results and independent numerical simulations, such
as restricted and direct fermionic PIMC, which is the aim of this paper.

Path Integral Representation of Thermodynamic
Quantities

We now brieﬂy outline the idea of our direct PIMC scheme. All thermodynamic
properties of a two-component plasma are deﬁned by the partition function Z
which, for the case of Ne electrons and Np protons, is given by

where β = 1/kB T . The exact density matrix is, for a quantum system, in general,
not known but can be constructed using a path integral representation (see

where ρ(i) ≡ ρ R(i−1) , R(i) ; ∆β ≡ R(i−1) |e−∆β Ĥ |R(i) , whereas ∆β ≡ β/(n +
1). Ĥ is the Hamilton operator, Ĥ = K̂ + Ûc , containing kinetic and potential energy contributions with Ûc = Ûcp + Ûce + Ûcep being the sum of the Coulomb potentials between protons (p), electrons (e) and electrons and protons (ep). Further,

R(i) = (q (i) , r(i) ) ≡ (Rp , Re ), for i = 1, . . . n + 1, R(0) ≡ (q, r) ≡ (Rp , Re ).
Also, R(n+1) ≡ R(0) and σ  = σ, i.e., the particles are represented by closed
Fermionic loops with the coordinates (beads) [R] ≡ [R(0) ; R(1) ; . . . ; R(n) ; R(n+1) ],
where r and q denote the electron and proton coordinates, respectively. The spin
gives rise to the spin part of the density matrix S, whereas exchange eﬀects are
accounted for by the permutation operator P̂ , which acts on the electron coordinates and spin, and the sum over the permutations with parity κP . In the
fermionic case (minus sign), the sum contains Ne !/2 positive and negative terms
leading to the notorious sign problem. Due to the large mass diﬀerence of electrons and protons, the exchange of the latter is not included.
Recently, we have derived a new representation for the high–temperature
density matrices ρ(i) in eq.(2) (see Filinov, V. S., et al. 2000) which is well
suited for direct PIMC simulations. A crucial point is that the electron–proton
interaction can be described by an (eﬀective) quantum pair potential Φ ep (Kelbg–
potential, see Kelbg 1964). For details of the derivation see Filinov, V. S., et al.
2000. Here, we present only the ﬁnal result for the energy and for the EOS.

Analytical Approximations for the Thermodynamic
Functions of Dense Plasmas

To describe dense plasmas, it is necessary to have thermodynamic functions valid
at arbitrary degeneracy. Here, we restrict ourselves to the Hartree–Fock (HF)
and the Montroll–Ward (MW) contributions. This approximation is appropriate
at temperatures high enough such that the Coulomb interaction is weak and the
possibility of the formation of bound states is excluded. HF and MW contributions have been computed numerically (see Kraeft et al. 1986). The analytical
evaluation of the MW contribution is possible in limiting situations only, namely
in the low and very high density cases. In the intermediate region Padé formulae
can be used to interpolate between the limiting cases. In between, the formulae
are ﬁtted to numerical data; (see Ebeling et al. 1981 , Haronska et al. 1987 and
Ebeling and Richert 1985). We give the excess free energy and the interaction
part of the chemical potential of the electron gas,

Hydrogen Isotherms

In this section we present results for the thermodynamic functions of dense
hydrogen versus density at constant temperature. The PIMC simulations have
been performed as explained in Filinov, V. S., et al. 2000, and Filinov V. S., et
al. 2001. Figures 1-3 show the simulation results together with the Padé results
for three hydrogen isotherms T = 50, 000; 100, 000; and 125, 000K. In all ﬁgures
the agreement between numerical and analytical data is good for temperatures
and densities, where the coupling parameter Γ is smaller than or equal to unity.
Reference points related to RPIMC and DPIMC calculations in Fig. 1 correspond
to data available for the temperature T = 62, 500K.

At low densities, pressure and energy are close to those of an ideal plasma.
Increasing the density above 1019 cm−3 , Coulomb interaction becomes important leading to a decrease of pressure and energy. Diﬀerences between analytical

1280

and numerical calculations in Fig. 1 are observed for densities above 10 22 cm−3
where the coupling parameter Γ exceeds unity. At temperatures of 100, 000 and
125, 000K, diﬀerences are observed for n above 5×1022 cm−3 . The degeneracy parameter ne λ3 reaches here values of 0.4. At higher densities (around 1024 cm−3 )
the degeneracy ne λ3 becomes larger than unity, and the interaction parts of
pressure and energy decrease as compared to the respective ideal contributions,
which leads to an increase of pressure and energy. At lower temperatures, this
tendency is accompanied by the vanishing of bound states, i.e., a transition from
a partially ionized plasma to a metal–like state. This tendency is correctly reproduced by all methods, however the density values of this increase vary. In Fig.
3 we compare our results with data from RPIMC simulations (see Militzer et al
2000). Obviously, the agreement is very good up to densities below 1024 cm−3 .

Discussion

This work is devoted to a Quantum Monte Carlo study of a correlated protonelectron system with degenerate electrons. We compared our direct PIMC simulations with independent restricted PIMC results of Militzer and Ceperley and
analytical formulae for isotherms corresponding to T = 50, 000; 100, 000; and
125, 000K. The values of Γ and ne Λ3e are varying in a wide range of values. This
region is of particular interest as here pressure and temperature ionization occur
and, therefore, an accurate and consistent treatment of scattering and bound
states is crucial. We found that the results agree suﬃciently well for coupling
parameters smaller or equal to unity. This is remarkable because analytical formulae, the DPIMC and RPIMC simulations are completely independent and use
essentially diﬀerent approximations. We, therefore, expect that these results for
hydrogen are reliable which is the main result of the present paper. We hope
that our simulation results allow us to derive and test improved analytical approximations in the future.
