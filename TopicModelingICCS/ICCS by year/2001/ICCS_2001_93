Abstract. It is shown that any simple polygon with n vertices can be
illuminated by at most �(3n − 5)/4� vertex π-ﬂoodlights. This improves
the earlier bound n − 2, whereas the best lower bound remains 3n/5 + c.

Introduction

The ﬁrst theorem on Art Galleries is due to Chvatál [1] who showed that any
simple polygon with n vertices can be illuminated by �n/3� light sources and
this bound is tight. The famous proof of Fisk [4] places light sources at vertices
of the polygon. It has been shown recently [7], that �n/3� is suﬃcient even if
the light sources can illuminate only a range of angle π (i.e. using π-ﬂoodlights).
But there, π-ﬂoodlights may be placed at any point of the polygon, even two
π-ﬂoodlights are allowed to be placed at the same point.
Urrutia [2] asked the following question. What is the minimal number of
vertex π-ﬂoodlights that can collectively illuminate any simple polygonal domain
(shortly polygon) P with n vertices. A vertex π-ﬂoodlight is given by a pair
(v, H v ) where v is a vertex of P and H v is a closed half-plane H v such that v is
on the boundary of H v . There may be at most one π-ﬂoodlight at each vertex
of P . A π-ﬂoodlight at (v, H v ) illuminates a ∈ P if and only if the closed line
segment va is in P ∩ H v . All points of P should be illuminated by at least one
π-ﬂoodlight.
F. Santos [9] has produced a family of polygons that requires �3n/5� + O(1)
vertex π-ﬂoodlights. Urrutia [2] conjectured that this number is always suﬃcient
to illuminate any polygon with n vertices but proved only the suﬃciency of n−2.
So far no constant b < 1 has been known such that bn+O(1) vertex π-ﬂoodlights
can illuminate any polygon with n vertices.
Theorem 1. �3(n − 3)/4� + 1 vertex π-ﬂoodlights can illuminate any simple
polygon with n vertices.
The notion of vertex α-ﬂoodlight can be deﬁned for any angle 0 < α < 2π
as a cone of aperture at most α with apex at a vertex of polygon P . Under the

condition that there may be at most one vertex ﬂoodlight at each vertex, it is
known [2] that for any angle α < π, there exist convex polygons Pn with n ≥ nα
vertices such that n α-ﬂoodlights cannot illuminate Pn .
In this paper, the placement of ﬂoodlights is based on a decomposition of the
polygon into “dense polygons”. Such decomposition was introduced in [8], and
is discussed in our Sect. 2. Any dense polygon with n vertices can be illuminated
with at most �(3n − 5)/4� vertex π-ﬂoodlights. This does not imply immediately
that any polygon P could be illuminated by 3n/4 + O(1) ﬂoodlights, because
at most one vertex π-ﬂoodlight can be placed at each vertex of P , and thus
there may be conﬂicts at vertices belonging to several dense sub-polygons. Our
ﬂoodlight placement algorithm and its analysis is contained in Sect. 4.

Dense Polygons

Let P be a simple polygon�and let T be a set of triangles in the plane. T is the
triangulation of P , if P = T , the triangles of T are pairwise non-overlapping,
and the vertices of the triangles are vertices of P . It is known that every simple
polygon has a triangulation, every triangulation consists of exactly n−2 triangles,
although the triangulation is not necessarily unique. We deﬁne the graph G(T )
on a triangulation T . The nodes of the graph correspond to the elements of T ,
two nodes are adjacent if and only if the corresponding triangles have a common
side. G(T ) is a tree on n − 2 nodes, the maximal degree in G(T ) is three, since a
triangle t ∈ T may have a common side with at most three other triangles of T .
Deﬁnition 1. A graph G is dense, if G is a tree and each node of G has degree one or three. A simple polygon S is dense if graph G(TS ) is dense for any
triangulation TS of S.
Proposition 1. Any dense graph G has an even number of nodes. If a dense
graph G has 2� nodes then it has exactly � + 1 leaves.
Proof. Suppose that G has k leaves and l nodes of degree 3. The number of edges
is (k+3l)/2 = (k+l)/2+l, hence k+l is even. G is a tree, so (k+l)/2+l = k+l−1,
that is k = (k + l)/2 + 1.

2.1

Dense Decomposition

The dense decomposition L of �
a polygon P is set of pairwise non-overlapping
dense polygons such that P = L and the vertices of the dense polygons are
vertices of P . We can deﬁne the tree G(L) on a dense decomposition L just like
G(T ). The nodes of the G(L) correspond to the dense polygons of L, two nodes
are adjacent if and only if the corresponding polygons have a common side.
The union of the triangulations of elements of a dense decomposition is a
triangulation T of P . So T contains an even number of triangles. Clearly, this
is impossible if P has an odd number of vertices. We can prove, however, the
following Lemma.

Lemma 1. If P is a simple polygon with an even number of vertices, then P
has a dense decomposition.
Proof. By induction on the number of nodes of G(T ). Every quadrilateral is
dense. If the polygon P is dense, then the proof is complete.
If P is not dense then there is a triangulation T of P such that there exists
a node of degree two in G(T ). Consider the tree G(T ) as a rooted tree (G(T ), r)
where an arbitrary leaf r of G(T ) is chosen as root. Let v ∈ G(T ) be a node
of degree two such that no descendant of v has degree two in G(T ). Let S
denote the subtree containing v and all its descendant in (G(T ), r). According
to Proposition 1, the subtree S has an even number of nodes, hence G(T ) \ S
has an even number of nodes as well. The polygons corresponding to S and
G(T ) − S have dense decompositions by induction, and together they give a
dense decomposition of P .

If P has an odd number of nodes, then let t correspond to a leaf of G(T ) in
a triangulation T of P . Polygon P − t has already an even number of vertices,
and t can be illuminated by one π-ﬂoodlight at the unique vertex not adjacent
to P − t. To establishes Theorem 1, it is enough to prove the following.
Lemma 2. Any simple polygon P with an even number n of vertices can be
illuminated by �3(n − 2)/4� vertex π-ﬂoodlights.
2.2

Notation of Dense Polygons

Let L be the dense decomposition of a simple polygon. Consider G(L) as a
rooted tree (G(L), r) with an arbitrary leaf r chosen as root. In this way we may

Illuminating Polygons with Vertex π-Floodlights

interpret the parent-son relation between dense polygons of L. For any polygon
S ∈ L, S �= r, let the base side of L be the side adjacent to the parent polygon
of S. For the root polygon, let the base side be any side not adjacent to any son
polygon. A base vertex of a polygon Q ∈ L is a vertex along its base side.
In our method, convex and concave quadrilaterals of the dense decomposition
have diﬀerent roles. We call star-polygon a dense polygon on at least 6 vertices.
Fix a triangulation TS in each S ∈ L.
An outer vertex of a star-polygon or concave quadrilateral S ⊂ P is a vertex
of S which belongs to exactly one triangle t ∈ TS . All other vertices of a star
polygon are called inner. Every vertex of a convex quadrilateral in L is outer.
The corner vertex of a concave quadrilateral Q ∈ L is the vertex opposite to the
reﬂex vertex of Q (a π-ﬂoodlight at v can illuminate Q).
Proposition 2.
(1) For every vertex v of P , there is at most one dense polygon S ∈ L such that
v is a non-base vertex of S.
(2) Every second vertex of a dense polygon is outer.
(3) Every outer vertex of a dense polygon is convex.
(4) A star polygon or a concave quadrilateral of L with 2� triangles has exactly
� + 1 outer vertices, one of which is a base vertex.
The proof of the above statements is immediate.
Proposition 3. For two vertices v and x of a star-polygon S, vx cannot be a
diagonal of S if v is an outer vertex for a triangulation TS .
Proof. Let u, v, and w be three consecutive vertices of S such that uvw is a
triangle in a triangulation TS of S. Suppose that vx is a diagonal of S. First
we state that there is a vertex y such that both uvy and uvy are diagonals. If
y = x does not have this property, then let y be the vertex in uvx where the
angle � uvy is minimal. There is a triangulation TS� of S such that uvy ∈ TS� . In
�
G(T � ), the node corresponding to uvy has degree 2.

Illuminating Star Polygons

In our method, every dense polygon S ∈ L will be illuminated by π-ﬂoodlights
placed at vertices of S. Lemma 2 is best possible in this setting, because there
are dense hexagons that cannot be illuminated by less than three vertex πﬂoodlights.
Deﬁnition 2. A π-ﬂoodlight (v, H v ) in P is called complementary, if P has a
reﬂex angle α at v and the angular domain of α contains the complementer of
the closed half-plane H v .
Lemma 3. Any dense polygon S ∈ L with 2� vertices can be illuminated by at
most � vertex π-ﬂoodlights at vertices of S: one at an arbitrary outer vertex and
at most � − 1 complementary π-ﬂoodlights at reﬂex vertices.

Proof. Fix a triangulation T of S. Suppose that we put a ﬂoodlight at an outer
vertex v. v belongs to a unique triangle xvy ∈ T . Let C(v) be the set of points
→ and −
→ hit the boundary
p ∈ S such that the line segment vp is in S. The rays −

vy
�
�
of S at points x and y resp.
According to Proposition 3, x� and y � are points of a same side ab of S. We
may suppose that b is an outer vertex. S \ C(v) consists of at most two simple
polygons Sx and Sy such that x ∈ Sx and y ∈ Sy . Every reﬂex vertex of S
is a vertex of exactly one of Sx and Sy . We may suppose w.l.o.g. that Sx is
non-empty.
Visit the reﬂex angles of Sx along the boundary from x to a in orientation
yvx. Consecutively dissect S at each reﬂex vertex w by a ray emanating from
w such that angle � w > 180◦ is partitioned into 180◦ and � w − 180◦ (e.g. � x
is dissected by the segment xx� ). Repeat this dissection in Sy as well if Sy �= ∅.
Thus S \ C(v) is partitioned into k convex polygons where k is the number of
reﬂex angles in S.
Our proof is complete if S has at most � − 1 reﬂex angles (e.g., S is quadrilateral). Suppose that S has � reﬂex angles, hence x is also reﬂex vertex. We state
that the last convex region C (along ax� ) is already illuminated by a complementary ﬂoodlight at another reﬂex vertices of Sx . (See Fig. 2 for illustrations.)

Remark 1. Consider a simple polygon P with a dense decomposition L and tree
(G(L), r). There is a placement of vertex π-ﬂoodlights in P such that every dense

Illuminating Polygons with Vertex π-Floodlights

777

polygon of L with 2� vertices is illuminated by � ﬂoodlight (i.e., also there is at
most one ﬂoodlight at each vertex of P ).
In each dense polygon S ∈ L, place a π-ﬂoodlight at a non-base outer vertex,
and another at most � − 1 complementary π-ﬂoodlights at reﬂex vertices according to Lemma 3. If a vertex v is a common vertex of two dense sub-polygons S1
and S2 , and we placed two ﬂoodlights at v, then one of them is a complementary
ﬂoodlight. Hence actually, we place at most one π-ﬂoodlight at each vertex.
Such a placement of ﬂoodlight is called basic placement. If L contains no
concave quadrilaterals then a basic placement requires �3(n − 2)/4� ﬂoodlights.

Proof of Lemma 2

Fix a dense decomposition L of polygon P , and a triangulation of each S ∈ L.
We illuminate every S ∈ L by π-ﬂoodlights at vertices of S. Every star-polygon
and convex quadrilateral of L is illuminated by basic placement described in
Remark 1. Every concave quadrilateral of L is illuminated either by two ﬂoodlights of a basic placement or by one ﬂoodlight. The main concern of our proof
is to guarantee that the majority of the concave quadrilaterals require only one
ﬂoodlight. Then 2� triangles of � concave quadrilaterals require at most �3(2�)/4�
ﬂoodlights, proving Lemma 2.
A basic placement is not necessarily unique. A star-polygon or a convex
quadrilateral S ∈ L has at least two non-base outer vertices. If Q ∈ L is illuminated by a ﬂoodlight at its non-base outer vertex v, then we color v red. We
make our choice using a voting function: A number of concave quadrilaterals
vote for each possible non-base outer vertex. We have another choice to make:
a ﬂoodlight at a non-base outer vertex v can be directed in two diﬀerent ways.
Again a number of concave quadrilaterals vote at each possible non-base outer
vertex. The winners require one ﬂoodlight, the losers require two.
It is enough to take care of the following two properties. Every concave
quadrilateral of L vote at most once. And every concave quadrilateral which
does not vote at all requires one ﬂoodlight.
4.1

Classifying Convex Quadrilaterals

Let R ⊂ L be the set of concave quadrilaterals of L. Denote by Q(v) ⊂ R the
set of concave quadrilaterals whose corner vertex is v.
We deﬁne recursively two functions g1 and g2 on concave quadrilaterals.
Suppose that g1 and g2 are deﬁned on all descendants of Q ∈ R. If the reﬂex
vertex of Q is a base vertex then let g1 (Q) = g2 (Q) = 0. Assume that Q = abcd
where d is non-base reﬂex vertex, and b is a base corner vertex. Denote by Hd+
and Hd− the two halfplanes determined by the line bd such that a ∈ Hd+ and
−
c ∈ Hd− . Partition Q(d) into two sets, Q+
d and Qd , such that reﬂex vertex of all

W ∈ Qd (resp. W ∈ Qd ) is in Hd (resp. in Hd ). Let Qd (d) ∈ Q(d) denote the

and

We deﬁne recursively a function f on non-base outer vertices of dense polygons of L. If f is deﬁned for all non-base outer vertices of all descendant of S ∈ L,
then consider a non-base outer vertex v such that u, v, and w are consecutive
vertices of S. Let H1+ and H1− (resp. H2+ and H2− ) be the half-planes determined
by uv (resp wv) such that w ∈ H1+ (resp. u ∈ H2+ ).

(1) f (v), h+ (v), and h− (v) are disjoint at each vertex v of P .
(2) f (u) ∪ h+ (u) ∪ h− (u) and f (v) ∪ h+ (v) ∪ h− (v) are disjoint for two non-base
vertices of star-polygons u and v.
Proof. Statement (1) is clear from the tree structure of (G(L), r).
For (2), we assign a non-base vertex r(Q) of a star-polygon to each element
of Q ∈ R. For a Q ∈ R, let (Q = Q0 , Q1 , . . . , Qt ) be the longest ascending path
in (G(L), r) such that Qi ∈ R for all element of the sequence and for all pair
(Qi , Qi+1 ), the corner vertex of Qi is a base vertex. (E.g. if the corner vertex of
Q is a non-base vertex, then the longest sequence is (Q = Q0 ).) Now observe
that Q ∈ f (v) ∪ h+ (v) ∪ h− (v) if the corner vertex r(Q) of Qt is v and v is a
non-base vertex of a star-polygon.

Placement of Vertex π-Floodlights

The functions f , g and h were deﬁned recursively in ascending order in G(L).
The placement of vertex π-ﬂoodlights is done in descending order on the tree
(G(L), r). We describe a ﬂoodlight-placement algorithm. Step I colors red certain

780

C.D. Tóth

non-base outer vertices of star-polygons and convex quadrilaterals. Step II colors
red or blue concave quadrilaterals. We apply a basic placement to star polygons
with a ﬂoodlight at the red vertex and to red quadrilateral. In Step III, each blue
concave quadrilateral is illuminated by adding at most one vertex π-ﬂoodlight.
Algorithm:
Step I, In each star polygon and convex quadrilateral of L, color a non-base
outer vertex v red, where |f (v)| is minimal. Color all elements of f (v) red, and
all elements of f (w) blue for all other non-base outer vertices.
Step II, For each vertex v of P with h+ (v) �= ∅ and h− (v) �= ∅, we make a
decision. If h+ (v) ≥ h− (v) (resp. h+ (v) < h− (v)) then color every element of
h− (v) (resp. h+ (v)) red and every element of h+ (v) (resp. h− (v)) blue.
Color the non-base outer vertex of each red concave quadrilateral red as well.
Step III, Consider a vertex v with Q(v) �= ∅.
First suppose that |Q(v)| = 1 and v is not red. Place a ﬂoodlight at v to
illuminate Q ∈ Q(v). From now on, we assume |Q(v)| > 1.
Suppose that v is a non-red convex non-base vertex of a dense polygon S, and
h+ (v) ≥ h− (v). Place a ﬂoodlight at (v, H2− ). We show that each quadrilateral
of f (v) ∪ h+ (v) can be illuminated by at most one ﬂoodlight. Every Q ∈ Q(v) in
H1+ is illuminated by (v, H1+ ), consider the possible case where abcd = Q2 (v) is
in f (v) ∪ h+ (v). Triangle abd ⊂ abcd is illuminated by (v, H1+ ). Place a ﬂoodlight
at (d, Hd+ ) to illuminate triangle abd as well. d is an inner vertex of abcd, so basic
placements may place at most a complementer ﬂoodlight at d.
Suppose that v is a red outer non-base vertex of a dense polygon S and
h+ (v) ≥ h− (v). That is, the ﬂoodlight at v is assigned to S, and it should
illuminate the angular domain uvw. Place a ﬂoodlight at (v, H1+ ). We show
that each quadrilateral of h+ (v) can be illuminated by at most one additional
ﬂoodlight. Every Q ∈ Q(v) in H1+ is illuminated by (v, H1+ ), consider the possible
abcd = Q2 (v) ∈ Q(v). Triangle bcd ⊂ abcd is illuminated by (v, H1+ ), place a
ﬂoodlight at (d, Hd+ ) to illuminate triangle abd as well. d is an inner vertex of
abcd, so basic placements may place at most a complementer ﬂoodlight at d.
If v is a reﬂex vertex of a star-polygon S, then one π-ﬂoodlight at v can
illuminate every quadrilateral of Q(v). This is the case also if v = d is a nonbase reﬂex vertex of a concave quadrilateral abcd, and there is no ﬂoodlight at
either (d, Hd− ) nor at (d, Hd+ ).
Suppose that v = d is a reﬂex vertex of a concave quadrilateral abcd and
there is a ﬂoodlight at, say, (d, Hd− ). It illuminates elements of Q+
d except a

red.
One
triangle of

Qd (D) = a� b� c� d� is illuminated by (d, Hd− ), place a ﬂoodlight at (d� , Hd+� ) to
illuminate the other triangle as well. d� is an inner vertex of a� b� c� d� , so basic
placements may place at most a complementer ﬂoodlight at d� .
During the algorithm, we assigned 0, 1, or 2 ﬂoodlights to each concave
quadrilateral. We assigned 2 ﬂoodlights to a concave quadrilateral if and only if
it is colored red. The comparisons of |f (v)| and |h+ (v)|, |h− (v)| guarantee that
the majority of concave quadrilaterals are colored blue.
