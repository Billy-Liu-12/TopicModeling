Abstract. This paper describes a neural network modelling approach to
premium price sensitivity of insurance policy holders. Clustering is used to
classify policy holders into homogeneous risk groups. Within each cluster a
neural network is then used to predict retention rates given demographic and
policy information, including the premium change from one year to the next. It
is shown that the prediction results are significantly improved by further
dividing each cluster according to premium change. This work is part of a
larger data mining framework proposed to determine optimal premium prices in
a data-driven manner.

1. Introduction
Like many competitive industries, the insurance industry is driven by two main
concerns: the need to return a profit to their shareholders and investors, and the need
to achieve market growth and retain a certain level of market share. These two goals
are seen as imperatives to success, but are often conflicting. Premium prices play a
critical role in enabling insurance companies to find a balance between these two
goals. The challenge is to set premium prices so that expected claims are covered and
a certain level of profitability is achieved, yet not to set premium prices so high that
market share is jeopardized as consumers exercise their rights to choose their insurers.
Insurance companies have traditionally determined premium prices by assigning
policy holders to pre-defined groups and observing the average behaviour of each
group. The groups are formed based on industry experience about the perceived risk
of different demographic groups of policy holders. With the advent of data
warehouses and data mining however comes an opportunity to consider a different
approach to premium pricing: one based on data-driven methods. By using data
mining techniques, the aim is to determine optimal premiums that more closely reflect
the genuine risk of individual policy holders as indicated by behaviours recorded in
the data warehouse.
In previous work we have proposed a data mining framework for tackling this
problem (Smith et al., 2000) (Yeo et al., 2001). This framework comprises

components for determining risk groups, determining the sensitivity of policy holders
to premium change, and combining this information to determine optimal premium
prices that appropriately balance profitability and market share. Recently we have
presented the results of the first component where clustering techniques are used to
define risk groups (Yeo et al., 2001). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
second component of the data mining framework: modelling the effect of premium
price changes on the customer retention rate.
In Section 2 we review the data mining framework employed in this study. A case
study approach utilising a database of over 330,000 policy holders is used to evaluate
the effectiveness of various techniques within this framework. Section 3 summarises
the previously published results for risk group classification. The use of neural
networks for modelling retention rates under various premium changes is then
discussed in Section 4. A strategy for improving the retention rate prediction by
dividing the data into more homogeneous groups and using separate neural network
models for each group is presented, and the results are compared to a single neural
network model. Computational results of prediction error rates are presented in
Section 5 for all risk classification groups. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6, where
future research areas are identified.

2.

A Data Mining Framework

Figure 1 presents a data mining framework for determining the appropriate pricing of
policies based upon the interaction of growth, claims and profitability. The framework
consists of four main components: identifying risk classifications, predicting claim
costs, determining retention rates, and combining this information to arrive at optimal
premiums. Firstly, the estimated risk of policy holders must be calculated, and used to
determine optimal premium values. The total premiums charged must be sufficient to
cover all claims made against the policies, and return a desired level of profit. The
levels of predicted claims can also be used to forecast profits, when coupled with
premium information. However premiums cannot be set at too high a level as
customers may terminate their policies, affecting market share. Sales forecasting is
determined by marketing information as well as models that predict customer
retention or “churn” rates. When integrated, this information provides a methodology
for achieving the two goals of market growth and profitability.
For optimal premiums to be set, the insurance company thus needs to determine
estimated claim costs and the effect of changes in premiums on retention rates. The
estimation of claim cost requires an accurate assessment of risk, discussed in the next
section.

3.

Risk Classification

Insurance companies group policy holders into various risk groups based on factors
which are considered predictors of claims. For example younger drivers are
considered to be a higher risk and so they are charged a higher premium. In designing

392

the risk classification structure, insurance companies attempt to ensure maximum
homogeneity within each risk group and maximum heterogeneity between the risk
groups. This can be achieved through clustering. In previous work (Yeo et al., 2001)
we have shown that the data-driven k-means clustering approach to risk classification
can yield better quality predictions of expected claim costs compared to a previously
published heuristic approach.

their sensitivity to premium changes, and a mechanism for combining this information to arrive
at premiums that try to balance profitability and market share.

The data for this study were supplied by an Australian motor insurance company.
Two data sets (training set and test set), each consisting of 12-months of
comprehensive motor insurance policies and claim information were extracted. The
training set consisted of 146,326 policies with due dates from 1 January to 31
December 1998 while the test set consisted of 186,658 policies with due dates from 1
July 1998 to 30 June 1999. Thirteen inputs were used to cluster policy holders.
The k means clustering model was used to generate a total of 30 risk categories.
Figure 2 is a graphical representation of the claim frequency and average claim cost
of the 30 clusters.

In the insurance industry, risk is measured by frequency or the probability of a
claim and the amount of claims. The higher the frequency, the higher the risk. The
higher the amount of claims, the higher the risk. The k-means clustering model was
able to find clusters which have significantly different claim frequency and claim
cost, without being provided with any claim information as input variables. In other
words, clustering is able to distinguish between low and high risk groups.
Besides the k means clustering we also experimented with a previously published
heuristic model (Samson et al., 1987) and fuzzy c-means model, but the k-means
clustering model produced the best results on the test set with a weighted absolute
deviation of 8.3% compared to the 15.6% for the fuzzy c-means model and 13.3% for
the heuristic model (Yeo et al., 2001).
Now that the policy holders have been classified into 30 risk groups based on their
demographic and policy information, we can examine the pricing sensitivity within
each cluster. Neural networks are used in the following section to model the effect of
premium price change on retention rates.

Modelling Retention Rates

Neural networks have been used in this paper to learn to distinguish policy holders
who are likely to terminate their policies from those who are likely to renew. They
are an ideal tool for solving this problem due to their proven ability to learn to
distinguish between classes, and to generalise their learning to unseen data. Prediction
of termination rates or “churn” prediction is a significant area of research, particularly
in the telecommunications and insurance industries. Several researchers have
successfully applied neural networks to churn prediction problems, and to better
understand the factors affecting a customer’s decision to churn (Smith et al., 2000)
(Mozer et al., 2000) (Madden et al., 1999) (Behara et al., 1994).

Data

The training set consisted of 146,326 policies with due dates from 1 January to 31
December 1998 while the test set consisted of 186,658 policies with due dates from 1
July 1998 to 30 June 1999. The period of overlap was to enable comparison of
exposure and rentention rates over a one-year period. Forty percent of the policies in
the test set were new policies. The training set was used to train the neural networks
and while the test set was used to evaluate the results.
In addition to the thirteen variables used for risk classification, premium and sum
insured information were used as inputs to the neural networks.

4.2

Neural Network Models

A multilayered feedforward neural network was constructed for each of the clusters
with 23 inputs, 20 hidden neurons and 1 output neuron. The 23 inputs were:
1. policy holder’s age,
2. policy holder’s gender,
3. area in which the vehicle was garaged,
4. rating of policy holder,
5. years on current rating,
6. years on rating one,
7. number of years policy held,
8. category of vehicle,
9. sum insured,
10. total excess,
11. vehicle use,
12. vehicle age,
13. whether or not the vehicle is under finance.
14. old premium,
15. new premium,
16. old sum insured,
17. new sum insured,
18. change in premium,
19. change in sum insured,
20. percentage change in premium,
21. percentage change in sum insured,
22. ratio of old premium to old sum insured,
23. ratio of new premium to new sum insured.
The hyberbolic tangent activation function was used. Input variables which were
skewed were log transformed. The neural network produces output between zero and
one, which is the probability that that a policy holder will terminate his policy. Figure
3 shows the probability of termination of Cluster 11. A threshold value is used to
decide how to categorise the output data. For example a threshold of 0.5 means that if
the probability of termination is more than 0.5, then the policy will be classified as
terminated. In our case, we have set a threshold so that the predicted termination rate
is equivalent to the actual termination rate for the whole cluster. For cluster 11, the

Modelling the Effect of Premium Changes

395

termination rate is 14.7% which means a threshold of 0.204 is needed to produce the
same predicted termination rate, as shown in Figure 3.
4.3

Prediction Accuracy

To determine how well the neural networks were able to predict termination rates for
varying amounts of premium changes, the clusters were then divided into various
bands of premium as follows: decrease in premiums of less than 22.5%, premium
decrease between 17.5% and 22.5%, premium decrease between 12.5% and 17.5%
etc. The predicted termination rates were then compared to the actual termination
rates. For all the clusters the prediction accuracy of the neural networks starts to
deteriorate when premium increases are between 10% to 20%. Figure 4 shows the
actual and predicted termination rates for one of the clusters (Cluster 24).

4.4 Generating More Homogeneous Models
In order to improve the prediction accuracy, the cluster was then split at the point
when prediction accuracy starts to deteriorate. Two separate neural networks were
trained for each cluster. The prediction accuracy improved significantly with two
neural networks as can be see from Figure 5. The average absolute deviation
decreased from 10.3% to 2.4%.

The neural network was then applied to the test set. The neural network performed
reasonably well on the test set with an average absolute deviation of 4.3% (Figure 6).
4.5

Combining Small Clusters

There were some small clusters which have too few policy holders to train the neural
networks. We grouped the small clusters which had fewer than 7,000 policies. Since
the objective is to ultimately determine the optimal premium which reflect the risk of
the policy holders, the criteria for grouping has to be similarity in risk. Risk in turn is
measured by the amount of claims. Therefore the clusters were grouped according to
similarity in claim cost. The maximum difference in average claim cost per policy
was no more than $50. Table 1 shows the grouping of the small clusters.
For the combined clusters, prediction ability is also improved by having two neural
networks instead of one for each cluster as can be seen from Figure 7 and Figure 8.
The average absolute deviation decreased from 10.3% to 3.5%. The test set has an
absolute deviation of 4.2% (Figure 9).

5. Results
Table 2 presents a summary of the results for all clusters. It shows clearly that the
average absolute deviation between the actual and predicted termination rates is
significantly reduced by employing two neural networks per cluster rather than a

single neural network. It appears that a single neural network is unable to
simultaneously learn the characteristics of policy holders and their behaviours under
different premium changes. This is perhaps due to the fact that many of the large
premium increases are due to an upgrade of vehicle. Since these policy holders may
well expect an increase in premium when their vehicle is upgraded they may have
different sensitivities to premium change compared to the rest of the cluster.
Attempting to isolate these policy holders and modelling their behaviours results in a
better prediction ability.

6. Conclusions and Future Research
This paper has examined the use of neural networks for modelling customer retention
rates within homogeneous groups. The work is part of a data mining framework for
determining optimal premium prices. Clustering is used to arrive at homogeneous
groups of policy holders based on demographic information. This information is then
supplemented with premium details, and a neural network is used to model
termination rates given premium changes. We have shown that significant
improvements in prediction accuracy can be obtained by further dividing each cluster
to isolate those policy holders with a significant increase in premium. It is believed
that these policy holders behave differently due to the greater number of these policy
holders who have upgraded their vehicles.
