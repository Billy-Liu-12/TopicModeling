Abstract. The paper presents an approach for calculation of the Voronoi
network of a system of balls con ned inside a cylindrical container. We
propose to consider a boundary of a container as one of the elements of the
system. Then the Voronoi network can be built for a system containing
non-spherical particles. An explicit formula to compute the coordinates
of the Voronoi vertex between a three balls and a cylinder are obtained.
The approach is implemented in 3D and tested on the models of balls
packing with di erent structure.

Introduction

The Voronoi ideas, that are well known in mathematics and computer science,
have been used extensively to solve many applied problems in physics, mechanics and chemistry [7, 6]. Originally, the Voronoi-Delaunay approach in physics
was applied to study the structure of disordered packing of balls and models of liquid and glasses [3]. The method is also a helpful tool for analysis of
voids: empty spaces between atoms, where the Voronoi network plays the role
of a navigation map [5]. This property of the Voronoi network has been used
in studying various problems, in particular to model the permeability and the
ﬂuid ﬂow through the packing of balls [1, 10].
Traditionally, the Voronoi-Delaunay method is applied to models with the periodic boundary conditions (used to simulate an inﬁnite media) or to models with
an open boundary (such as biological molecules. However, in many physicalchemical problems the boundary plays the determinative role. For example, a
typical chemical reactor is a cylinder ﬁlled with the spherical granules. To simulate ﬂows through the packing in the cylinder one should create an algorithm
that takes into account the boundary of the system. From the mathematical
point of view, the problem is similar to building the medial axes inside a cylindrical cavity containing balls. However, the known approaches to compute the
medial axes inside a cavity [8, 9] are complicated and thus deem to be ineﬃcient
for the analysis of models with a large number of balls.
In this paper, we present an eﬃcient approach for the calculation of the Voronoi
network of a packing of balls inside a cylinder. We propose to consider a cylindrical boundary as an additional non-spherical element of the system, and provide
an explicit formula to compute the coordinates of the Voronoi vertex between
the three balls and a cylindrical boundary. The algorithm was implemented and
tested in 3D for packings with diﬀerent structure.

The algorithm

One of the possible ways to compute the Voronoi network for a set of balls in a
cylinder is to use the algorithm presented in [4], where the Voronoi network was
calculated for 3D systems of straight lines and sphere-cylinders. The algorithm
is based on the idea of the Delaunay empty sphere [7]. Let us assume that the
empty sphere moves inside the system so that it touches at least three objects
at any moment of time. In this case the center of the sphere moves along an
edge of the 3D Voronoi network. If the distance from any point in the space to
any object is expressed by explicit functions d, then the trajectory of the center
of the Delaunay empty sphere can be computed numerically by performing the
series of small shifts along the edge. The direction of the shift v is found from
the equation: (∇di · v)|r = (∇dj · v)|r = (∇dk · v)|r , where the indices i, j, k
enumerate the objects touched by the sphere. For a cylindrical wall we use the
following distance function: dc = Rc − (x2 + y 2 )1/2 , where Rc is the radius
of the cylinder, x and y are the coordinates of a point inside the cylinder,
provided the origin is on the axis of the cylinder. dc is a diﬀerentiable function
of the coordinates, except for the axis of the cylinder. The advantage of this
method is in its simplicity and versatility: it can be used to build the Voronoi
network for the system of any convex non-spherical objects for which there is
no explicit formula to compute the coordinates of the Voronoi vertex. However
this approach is rather time consuming: as it was shown on a packing of balls of
diﬀerent radii this algorithm runs 20 times slower then the algorithm based on
explicit calculation of the coordinates of the Voronoi vertex [4]. For the problem
of balls in cylinder, we can ﬁnd a formula for the Voronoi vertex explicitly.

The Empty Sphere Problem

The task is to inscribe a sphere between the cylinder and three balls, that
are located inside the cylinder and do not intersect. For simplicity, assume the
cylinder is vertical. Denote the sphere with the smallest radius as (x4 , y4 , z4 , r4 ).
Choose the origin at the center of this sphere. Now, we apply the technique
similar to one presented in [2]. We shrink all the balls by r4 , increase cylinder
radius by r4 , and obtain the set of equations representing the condition that the
inscribed sphere with the center (x, y, z) and the radius r touches three spheres
and the cylinder:

(x − x1 )2 + (y − y1 )2 = (r1 − r)2



(x − x2 )2 + (y − y2 )2 + (z − z2 )2 = (r + r2 )2
(x − x3 )2 + (y − y3 )2 + (z − z3 )2 = (r + r3 )2


 2
x + y 2 + z 2 = r2 .
Here (x1 , y1 , r1 ) are the coordinates of the axis of the cylinder and its radius,
and (xi , yi , zi , ri ), i = 2, 3 are the coordinates and radii of the two remaining

where l1 = x1 2 + y1 2 − r1 2 , li = xi 2 + yi 2 + zi 2 − ri 2 , i = 2, 3.

where |A| denotes the determinant of the matrix. When |A| = 0, we arrive to
the degenerate case, i.e. there are inﬁnitely many inscribed spheres. Thus, let
us assume that |A| �= 0. The obtained expressions are substituted into the last
equation x2 + y 2 + z 2 − r2 = 0, which yields the 4th degree polynomial of z:
az 4 + bz 3 + cz 2 + dz + e = 0

Up to four solutions are possible. However, the solutions with imaginary and

Figure 1: A cylinder with the balls (a), the arrangement of the balls in the
cylinder (b), the Voronoi network (edges of the Voronoi diagram) taking into
consideration the cylinder (c).
The algorithm for Voronoi network calculation was implemented in Fortran.
Fig. 1 illustrate its application for a system of 40 balls with equal radii r = 0.2
in a cylinder of radii rc = 2.0. One can note that the Voronoi edges that are at
the center of the cylinder are segments of straight lines. They are edges of the
standard Euclidean Voronoi diagram. While the edges at the cylinder surface
are curved. This situation is typical for systems with the non-spherical particles
(the edges are on the intersection of curved quadratic surfaces). The algorithm
was also tested on a system representing dense packing of 300 Lennard-Jones
atoms with diﬀerent structure. Two models: one is a model with disordered
packing obtained by Monte-Carlo relaxation in a cylinder with a ﬁxed value of
the diameter D = 6σ (where σ is the parameter of the Lennard-Jones potential) and the other model with the crystalline-like structure (made by slightly
varying the diameter of cylinder). The reslts show that the largest channels
(Voronoi network bonds with the largest bottle-necks) occur near to the wall
of the cylinder. This is an anticipated result, since a ﬂow of liquid through a
packing of balls is inhomogeneous and the main streams are at the cylinder wall.
It was also noted that a fraction of large channels along the wall is higher for
the model with the disordered packing than for the crystalline-like model.
