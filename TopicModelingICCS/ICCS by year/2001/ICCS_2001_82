Abstract: This short paper presents the overview of an ongoing project which
goal is to obtain and simulate the dynamics of qualitative systems through the
combination of the properties of Fuzzy Boolean Networks and Fuzzy Rule
Based Cognitive Maps.

1. Introduction
Decision makers, whether they are social scientists, politicians or economists, usually
face serious difficulties when approaching significant, real-world dynamic systems.
Such systems are composed of a number of dynamic concepts interrelated in complex
ways, usually including feedback links that propagate influences in complicated
chains. Axelrod work on Cognitive Maps (CMs) [1] introduced a way to represent
real-world qualitative dynamic systems, and several methods and tools [2,3] have
been developed to analyze the structure of CMs. However, complete, efficient and
practical mechanisms to analyze and predict the evolution of data in CMs are
necessary but not yet available for several reasons [4]. System Dynamics tools like
those developed by J.W.Forrester [5] could be a solution, but since in CMs numerical
data may be uncertain or hard to come by, and the formulation of a mathematical
model may be difficult, costly or even impossible, then efforts to introduce
knowledge on these systems should rely on natural language arguments in the absence
of formal models. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM), as introduced by Kosko [6], are an
alternative approach to system dynamics. However, in most applications, a FCM is
indeed a man-trained Neural Network that doesn’t share the qualitative properties of
other fuzzy systems [7], and the modeled system ends up being represented by a
quantitative matrix without any qualitative knowledge. Therefore, we can say that
there are currently no tools available to adequately represent the dynamics of
qualitative systems.
Even if we had the tools to represent and analyze those systems, a different issue
would be the building of a qualitative CM. The standard methodology for acquisition
of the necessary data relies usually on lengthy processes of individual and simplistic

information collection: the result ends up being a list of quantitative relevant world
concepts displayed as a matrix where weights represent the relations between those
concepts [2,3,4,6]. Therefore we end up with quantitative CMs where any vestiges of
a system with real-world rich qualitative entities and rich qualitative relations were
simply ignored. Besides, there is the additional problem of combining the views of
different analysts into one single map, which is usually done by simple math
operations between the resulting matrixes.
This paper presents a general overview of an ongoing work that pretends to
potentiate two original research lines to solve the problems presented above.
The first research line is in the potential use of really Qualitative Cognitive Maps
as a tool not only to describe but also to simulate scenarios in qualitative real world
systems like Social Conflicts, Political Science cases or Economic real-world
problems. Fuzzy Rulebased Cognitive Maps (RB-FCM) [7,8,9,10] were introduced in
previous works and are still being developed. They provide new Fuzzy Operators and
a complete methodology for analysis and design of the dynamics of qualitative
systems.
The second research line develops a new class of Boolean Neural Nets - Fuzzy
Boolean Networks (FBN) [11,12,13] - which behave like fuzzy systems and are
capable of non supervised learning of rules and of using the learned rules in
qualitative reasoning.

2. Automatic Implementation and Simulation of Cognitive Maps
This paper purposes and introduces the overall architecture of AISCMap (Automatic
Implementation and Simulation of Cognitive Maps). AISCMap should automatically
generate a RB-FCM using FBN for the acquisition of the rules, concepts and relations
that compose the map, allowing the simulation of what-if scenarios in the qualitative
system that it models. The following sections provide a simplified description of
AISCMap.
2.1 Inputs for AISCMAP
The inputs for AISCMap consist of the output provided by expert’s analysis of the
system to be modeled. Even after debate, each expert might have its own view of the
problem, and a preferred way of representing the system. They can use natural
language to express concepts and the rules relating them; they can provide examples
of possible relations and their effect; they can define what is the type of relation
involving two or more concepts; they can describe the system using matrixes, etc.
2.2 The Fuzzy Boolean Network Module
The FBN module extracts RB-FCM concepts, rules and relations from the expert raw
data combining them into a single qualitative cognitive map. The map is described
using RB-FCMSyntax, which is a language developed to provide a complete
description of a RB-FCM.

Neural Networks are known for their capability in apprehending relationships
among variables, but is also well known their difficulty in expliciting these relations
into human comprehensive rules [15]. Fuzzy logic based systems, are very useful in
explaining behaviors by a set of qualitative rules [14], but are not so good in which
concerns learning of those rules. A synergetic cooperation between these two
paradigms leads usually to hybrid systems that can learn and also explain the
relationships by rules. However, these hybrid systems are usually an artificial
engineered human work, where algorithms as well as fuzzy and neural components
are "inserted" into the system. Although being based on common grounds, FBN are a
new class of neural fuzzy systems that don’t have many things in common with other
neuro-fuzzy systems. Fuzzy qualitative reasoning is a natural and emergent property
of Boolean networks[11,12]. These nets present many similarities with natural
systems. They are capable of learning rules from non-supervised experiments in an
Hebbian-like manner and they can automatically adapt to the granularity[13] of the
antecedent variables and select the relevant ones. FBN are Boolean Nets with
Macroscopic Emergent Fuzzy Reasoning, which allows them to extract qualitative
rules from experimental data [11,12]. Here are some of the main FBN features:
� Variables/Concepts are associated with neural areas
� Values are given by neural activation
� Local Random Neural Connections
� Macro Structured (Links connecting Areas)
� Hebbian like Nonsupervised Learning by experiments
� Embedded Variable Selection and Granular adaptation
2.3 From FBN to RB-FCM
In AISCMap it is necessary to extend the working principles of the FBN to the
problem of RB-FCM. This involves the adequate definition of the relationship
between concepts and structure of the Maps and the neural areas and sub-areas as
defined on the FBN.
2.4 Representing and Modeling Real World Qualitative Dynamic Systems
The RB-FCM allow a representation of complex real-world dynamic qualitative
systems and the simulation of events and their influence in the system. RB-FCM are
essentially composed of fuzzy Concepts and fuzzy Relations. Concepts are fuzzy
variables that represent the value or the change in Actors, or Social, Political,
Economical or Abstract entities that compose the system we are trying to model
[7,8,9,10].
Relations between concepts are defined using fuzzy rule bases and can be of
several types: Fuzzy Causal; Fuzzy Influence; Possibilistic; Invariant and Time
variant Probabilistic; Possibilistic and Probabilistic; Fuzzy Similarity; Level/Change
[10].
RB-FCM are iterative and provide mechanisms to simulate the dynamics of the
system it represents (including fuzzy mechanisms to simulate time, which is not a

given issue when relations are not time dependent mathematical equations as in
system dynamics tools). The evolution of the system through time might converge in
a single state or a cycle of states under certain conditions [7].
One of the main important uses for a dynamic model of a system, is the analysis of
"WHAT-IF" scenarios (“What happens to the system when some event occurs?”),
since the change of state in one or more concepts or relations affect the system in
ways that are usually difficult or impossible to predict due to complex feedback links.
RB-FCM are well adapted to these analysis, since introduction or removal of concepts
and/or relations are possible and easily done without the hassle of the exponential
increase of rules usually associated with fuzzy rule based systems [7,9].

3. Conclusions
AISCMAP is an ongoing work that is the result of a synergic approach of two
different areas. Most of its modules are on an advanced stage of evolution, and the
obtained results are promising, but there is still a lot of work to be done especially on
the interaction between the expert results and the inputs to the system; and on the
interaction FBN/RB-FCM.
