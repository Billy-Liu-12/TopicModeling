Abstract. The Soot Model Development Web Site (SMDWS) is a project to
develop collaborative technologies serving combustion researchers in DOE national laboratories, academia and research institutions throughout the world. The
result is a shared forum for problem exploration in combustion research. Researchers collaborate over the Internet using SMDWS tools, which include a
server for executing combustion models, web-accessible data storage for sharing
experimental and modeling data, and graphical visualization of combustion effects. In this paper the authors describe the current status of the SMDWS project, as well as continuing goals for enhanced functionality, modes of collaboration, and community building.

1 Introduction
The emergence of the Internet has enabled interactions among people working in the
same field around the globe. This has inspired many efforts to address the associated
problems of effective group communication, and provide access to information
sources that are geographically and administratively disparate. Collaboratories are one
way to provide virtual shared workspace to users. A Collaboratory is a wide area distributed system supporting a rich set of services and tools that facilitate effective synchronous and asynchronous communication between two or more people who are not
co-located [1]. To date, collaboratories have been developed in many areas including
material science [2], natural science [3], telemedicine [4], space physics [5], and environmental molecular sciences [6]. In the combustion field, web-based collaboratories
have been developed in the areas of turbulent diffusion flames [7] and diesel engines
[8].

The University of Utah Center for the Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions
(C-SAFE) [9] is an interdisciplinary project funded under the DOE Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative Alliances program. This center focuses on providing largescale high performance science-based tools for the numerical simulation of accidental
fires and explosions, targeted at issues associated with safe handling and storage of
highly flammable materials.
The Validation Web Site (SMDWS) [10] is in turn a research project under C-SAFE
providing a shared problem exploration environment for combustion researchers. The
SMDWS enables researchers to work together across geographic and organizational
boundaries to solve complex interdisciplinary problems, and to securely share access
to resources at participating web including specialized databases and computational
servers. In short, the goal of the SMDWS project is to make science and information
exchange more efficient, opportunistic and synergistic for combustion researchers at
large.
This paper discusses the application area, the SMDWS requirements, and the SMDWS
architecture and design.

2 Application: Combustion Modeling
Soot formation is a significant environmental problem associated with the operation of
many practical combustion devices.
An accurate simulation of soot formation is critical to the C-SAFE goal of predicting
the radiative heat transfer in fires, since soot is a dominant component of hydrocarbon
fires. High heat flux and emissions from accidental fires pose significant human and
property hazards.
The Soot Model Development Web Site has been developed to allow the C-SAFE
group working on the development of soot models to collaborate with researchers at
LLNL, LBL, SNLA, SNLL, UC Berkeley, Polytechnic of Milan, and the University of
Naples. Model development is a complex task requiring a close interplay among experimentation, development of chemical submodels, model validation and formulation
of new modeling concepts. Progress in this already difficult task is further complicated
by the interdisciplinary nature of the required collaboration, as well as the geographical distribution of experts in the field throughout the national laboratories, industry,
and universities. Effective model development requires validation of individual model
components as well as strategies for their integration. For example, C-SAFE’s soot
modeling task has the specific goal of developing reliable, experimentally validated
models of soot formation that can be used in a numerical simulation and optimization
of combustion devices. Success in this task clearly requires the critical comparison and
co-design of soot formation mechanisms being developed both within and outside of
C-SAFE. Hence a coordinate effort between the many researchers is required to obtain
the best soot formation mechanism possible. It was judged early in the C-SAFE project that development of an interactive, web-based tool for this purpose was essential to
achieving this goal. The C-SAFE Validation group has adopted the role of leading this

effort and is hosting an electronic interaction facility with the assistance of Computer
Scientists within the C-SAFE team. We have collected several combustion modeling
codes and made them available to the SMDWS over the Internet: ChemkinII, a chemical kinetics package for the analysis of gas-phase chemical kinetics; ChemkinII/Soot
[11], which is Chemkin with kinetic modeling of soot formation; and DSmoke [12],
which supports the analysis of different reactors in series or in parallel coupled with a
mixer or splitter. Several reaction mechanisms are also available at the SMDWS:
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s mechanisms for the formation of aromatic
compounds and other species [13,14], kinetic mechanisms by Prof. Frenklach’s group
at the University of California at Berkeley [15,16], reaction schemes by Polytechnic of
Milan, Italy [17], etc. The SMDWS also provides links to important public databases
in the area (e.g., www.ecs.umass.edu/MBMS/) for browsing and comparison with data
contributed to the SMDWS web site. Also provided is a database of premixed flames
data collected from the literature. The modeling results obtained by Utah’s own soot
combustion group are reported on the web to invite critical feedback and solicit additional contributions from other research groups. The goal of the SMDWS is to make
doing science, engineering and information exchange among research partners more
efficient and synergistic. Researchers are able to tackle new problems with their existing methods and to access new methods through collaborations that were previously
infeasible due data and software interchange obstacles.

3 Soot Model Development Web Site Requirements
The SMDWS has defined a specific set of requirements in order to accomplish these
goals. The researchers at different sites must be able to:
�
�
�
�
�

Share graphical data easily using web browsers
Discuss modeling strategies and easily share model descriptions between groups
Archive collaborative information in a web-accessible electronic notebook
Utilize a remote execution system to run combustion models at remote
locations and
Readily explore and analyze experimental data and modeling results
through web browsers

At present a first approximation to these goals has been implemented, including use of
our web server as the only computational host, and a rudimentary file based electronic
notebook facility. Many of zero-dimensional chemistry simulations (such as Premix of
the Chemkin software) can run for hours to days on high-end workstations and produce kilobytes of data. The resulting data sets are visualized using simultaneous 2-D
plots of multiple variables. In addition to dealing with the practicalities of such scale
issues, many of the collaborative tools (e.g., modeling tools) must be integrated to
allow data to flow easily between tools. The SMDWS architecture must support rapid
and easy integration of new modeling and visualization tools and newly developed
models. Modeling and visualization tools include commercially developed software,
as well as software developed by some of the partners, often written in Fortran (for
example the DSmoke code developed by Prof. Ranzi’s group at the University of Milan, Italy). Users must be able to locate and combine resources and data to form effective teams.

4 Design of the SMDWS Architecture
The SMDWS is based on a software framework facilitating the addition and integration of computing services and supporting tools. Careful thought as to the underlying
architecture is critical to the smooth evolution of the web site to meet growth and
diversification of collaborative, modeling, and visualization demands. Our framework
naturally divides into client and server components. The server component has the
following properties:
1.

3.

Support for running codes from local and remote contributors, including
pre- and post-processors
Validation of required and optional input
Delivery of output files as specified by client

Browsing and query-driven inspection of arbitrarily large output files
Return of partial results upon failure, with diagnostic reports.

The SMDWS server architecture consists of two parts: a web server and database
server. Both parts run under Window NT Server 4.0.
1.

Our web server uses an Apache 1.3.14 web server, supplemented by an
Apache JServ 1.0 servlet engine. One multipurpose Java servlet (under
JSDK2.0) receives two kinds of requests from clients:
a)

Get the input parameters and input data files for simulation run
from client side, then call a DOS shell script and an Expect
script (Expect 5.21) to run the executable codes, and finally
store the results in the database.
b) Receive a database query from client side, then get the database response and return the results to the client. Client web
pages provide input parameters through a Java Applet
(JDK1.1.8) interface. In addition, we have provided an optional username and password protected version of our website
where Raven SSL 1.4.1 provides Digest Authentication for
web security.
2.

Our database server runs on Microsoft SQL Server 7.0. The Java servlet
communicates with SQL Server through an RmiJdbc server and a
JDBC/ODBC bridge.

The client framework is Java code supporting the integration of contributed combustion modeling codes (rarely in Java) to be integrated into the SMDWS. Properties
include:
�
�
�
�
�
�

Status monitoring of long running execution requests with periodic updates
Termination and subsequent recovery of intermediate results
Flexible invocation of all computational resources, including pre-processors
and post-processors
Definition and upload of required and optional input files
Inspection and download of expected output files
Parameterizable visualization, currently limited to 2D plotting

Employing client and server frameworks allows new capabilities to be added easily,
facilitates maintenance of SMDWS client and server code, maximizes code reuse and
enables integration with third party components such as web and database server tools.

Future development of the SMDWS will support electronic notebooks and shared
workspaces where researchers can annotate combustion codes, input data sets, and
result files --- all accessible through their web browsers. The electronic notebooks will
contain a rich variety of information – text and images, and links to information can be
simultaneously viewed, edited and annotated on the pages of a notebook. Similarly, it
is planned that shared workspaces will be made interactively accessible using a web
browser, enabling users to dialog about modeling codes, input files, output files, data
plots, and notes on the computational models.
A 2-D plotting package using the Java 2D Graph Package v2.4 has been integrated
into the SMDWS modeling client template, such that users can interactively plot modeling results from several modeling runs. Users can then save plots as files or save plot
files in a file repository.

5 Collaborative Tools in the SMDWS
The challenges involved in successful deployment of the SMDWS include development and implementation of an appropriate collaboratory infrastructure, integration of
new interdisciplinary tools, and the deployment and adoption of the SMDWS among
the research community. To accomplish this, we have planned a systematic approach
to the development, integration, and testing of tools. The initial phase of deployment
has been to directly involve the most interested combustion researchers in tool development and testing. The SMDWS has been found to have highest impact when geographically separated researchers are motivated to interact directly with each other to
achieve their goals. The focus effort provides direct support to researchers as they
confront some of the cultural changes inherent in electronic collaboration. These
changes include the use of new technologies and the development of social behaviors
in electronic communication and collaboration [1]. One challenge in particular is the
balance of the increased access to each other data, resources, and presence with the
desire to invoke electronic security to protect the same.
The SMDWS project will be broadening the target research to multiple projects including a broader range of collaborators and the dissemination of new technology to
the other interested groups. The broadening of the target research areas will provide a
greater test of the generality of our approach and an opportunity to incorporate some
advanced tools.

5.1 Examples of SMDWS Application
Descriptions of illustrative scenarios in the SMDWS serve to further describe its application in combustion research. Here we provide a few brief descriptions:

A user can retrieve previous results generated by a collaborator from a
shared workspace, interpret this data then rerun modeling code with new
inputs, and put new results in the shared workspace that can be viewed
by collaborators.
A scientist can start a modeling run in collaboration with a distant colleague. The results will be stored in a repository for both to see.
The combustion scientists upload input files from local machines for
remote execution of the code using the respective SMDWS clients. Output files are returned to the scientist’s machines and the modeling results
could be immediately analyzed using the SMDWS client’s interactive
2D plotting package (see Figure 2).

All the calculations are documented in web-based files that can be accessed by collaborators. As mentioned above, our ultimate goal is for the combustion scientist to
use real-time collaboration tools to discuss results with colleagues.

6 Status and Future Work
The SMDWS project is continuing to develop collaborative technologies for combustion researchers distributed throughout the national laboratories and academia. We
have assembled an overall soot formation mechanism starting from a surrogate hydrocarbon fuel that has been experimentally developed to reproduce the features of jet
fuels important for pool fires. This mechanism draws on experimental and ab initio

492

approaches to obtaining rate data for the elementary reaction assembled from the literature. Validation of the mechanism has been performed by comparison of the soot
formation mechanism with measurements from laboratory flames. Thus for the site
permits the remote running of the soot models on a local server, thus providing a
means for all collaborators work with the same version of mechanisms and models.
The site also provides a Discussion Page for dialogue on the results of mechanism
comparisons. User friendly and low maintenance security is a difficult challenge and
will require continuous development with user feedback for some time. In the future
we expect to offer a real-time conferencing capability. Ultimately, desktop video and
data conferencing among researchers will be investigated as appropriate Internet connection bandwidth becomes available.
Collaboratory technology is having an impact, however. One of the most significant
impacts of the SMDWS is to extend the researcher’s capabilities to use new tools by
making possible the use of such tools in collaboration with an expert at another location. The ability to handle such knowledge resources is a key to interdisciplinary collaboration and an important characteristic of the SMDWS.
Future work will build on the current successes in framework implementation, tool
development. We are searching simultaneously both a greater range of capabilities and
a higher level of user friendliness. New target research groups will involve international participation with new challenges for interoperability and bandwidth. We anticipate new client/server templates for multi-code simulations, new capabilities for
collaborative visualization and group collaboration built on new tools, and improved
commercial tools.
