Abstract. Here we discuss results of further development of numerical method
for computer simulation of unsteady flows with number of strong and weak discontinuities in case of nonequilibrium homogeneous condensation. This method
is based on idea of explicit tracking of discontinuity surfaces (shock waves,
rarefaction waves, contact surfaces) during calculation process. The results for
generation of silver clusters in dense vapors during unsteady spherical expansion closed vacuum chamber are presented.

1 Introduction
The solution of many real problems requires numerical treatment of unsteady flows
with nonequilibrium processes. Flow field can include strong (shock waves and contact surfaces) and weak (boundary characteristics of expansion waves) discontinuities.
As result of interaction of discontinuities their number changes with time. Currently
two classes of numerical methods are used for treatment of such flows.
First class consists of shock-capturing methods. They use the same algorithm for all
grid points without special procedures for calculation the points on discontinuity surfaces and their main advantage is uniformity. It results in their easy coding. But even
best types of them (TVD, ENO, etc.) have disadvantage of spreading discontinuity to
2-3 grid cells. In case of contact surface such spreading is even worse due to unphysical growing of its length with time. It is possible to avoid this problem by using small
grid cells near contact surface or special adaptive grids. But it violates the uniformity
of algorithm.
Second class of methods includes the methods of tracking all or most intensive discontinuities. Their main principles have been formulated few decades ago and their
effectiveness was proved many times. But due to common opinion that discontinuity
tracking is extremely complex and poorly formalized process the number of investigaV.N. Alexandrov et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2001, LNCS 2073, pp. 511-517, 2001.

tions carried out by above methods is very small. In most of them only limited constant number of strong discontinuities is tracked.
The advantage of methods with explicit tracking of discontinuities is simple calculation of hybrid grids with steady regular sub-grid and adaptive moving sub-grid. The
last relates to tracked discontinuities and moving boundaries. It results in highaccuracy of calculations even in case of small number of nonmoving grid points.
In our previous publications [1,2] we proposed the numerical technique, which
combines the advantages of both classes of methods: uniformity of algorithm and
automatic explicit tracking of existed initially and generated later strong/weak discontinuities. This technique was successfully used for simulation of non-reacting gas
expansion flow in vacuum chamber with solid [1] and porous [2] walls. Here we present the generalization of this technique for reacting flows with nonequilibrium homogeneous condensation.

2 Mathematical Model of Unsteady Flows of Condensing Vapors
The model is based on quasi-one-dimensional unsteady mass, momentum and energy
transfer conservation laws written in differential form in areas of continuity solution
and integral form at discontinuity surfaces. Flow is considered as inviscid and with no
heat-conduction.
The corresponding system of equations for binary mixture of inert gas and condensing vapor has the next form:

3 Numerical Method
The suggested numerical method is based on the next principles:
- the flow is calculated by grid-characteristics method by t=const layers,
- the whole flow region is divided to sub-regions with continuity parameters in
them, and their boundaries are surfaces of strong/weak discontinuities or external left/right boundaries of the region,
numerical grid consists from non-moving and moving points. The last ones
are points of discontinuities. Pairs of values corresponding left and right limits of continuum solution describe parameters in them. If discontinuity is stable (it has the same type on the next time step), the left/right values satisfy to
integral relations for this type of discontinuity,
- for crossing points of two strong discontinuities the left/right values don’t
satisfy to such relation. The formation of new discontinuity surfaces occurs
and determination of number, types and parameters of these discontinuities
should be obtained from solution of corresponding Riemann problem;
- the standard time step is selected from the Courant condition. But if crossing
of any discontinuities happens before next time, the exact time of nearest
crossing is taken;
- the calculation process is divided into gas-dynamic half-step (calculation of
u, p, T from calculated previously concentrations and right-hand-sides of kinetic equations) and kinetic half-step (calculation of concentrations by integration of kinetic equations);
- the possibility of generation of shock wave in initially continuous sub-region
is analyzed. The coordinate and time of such generation point is calculated
from crossing point of characteristics of the same type;
- flow parameters in each of grid nodes are calculated from characteristic conditions. The base points can locate as on previous time layer as on discontinuities surfaces. That means that all base points relates to one sub-region of

514

continuum solution. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically
and if there is no convergence for given number of iterations, the time step is
decreased.
Any grid points relates to one of the following types: symmetry axis, solid wall, shock
wave, contact surface, discontinuity characteristic, usual characteristic, trajectory and
nonmoving usual grid point. From physical consideration it is clear that 18 types of
crossing can take place.
For interactions shock wave/shock wave or shock wave/contact surface the structure and parameters of resulting flow are calculated from generalized solution of Riemann problem on case of reacting gases with variable ratios of specific heats. It can
be shown that for thermodynamic model of inert gas/condensing vapor mixture [3]
this problem has unique solution.
After solution of Riemann problem initial parameters of all generated discontinuities are known. For extra-intensive expansion waves the several additional usual characteristics are put into wave. Their number is proportional to pressure gradient in
expansion wave. All generated discontinuities have the same coordinate but different
parameters.
For shock wave/solid wall or shock wave/symmetry axis the parameters of reflected shock are calculated from Rankine-Hugoniot type conditions for multicomponent gas and condition u=0 behind the shock.
In case of flow with cylindrical or spherical symmetry near symmetry axis (r=0) the
intensity of shock wave is infinite. The point of shock wave/symmetry axis interaction
is special point with infinite values of shock velocity and pressure behind shock. The
flow in such case can be calculated from known solution of Huderlay-LandauStanukovich by special algorithm.
The interactions of usual characteristics with usual characteristic, discontinuity
characteristic, contact surface, solid wall, shock wave, symmetry axis and discontinuity characteristic with contact surface, shock wave, discontinuity characteristic, solid
wall, symmetry axis are limiting cases of above situations. Further tracking of given
characteristic or its exchange to characteristic of another family at interaction with
solid wall or contact surface is determined from flow properties.
Parameters in points of interactions of trajectories with usual or discontinuity characteristics are calculated by usual method of characteristics. For trajectory/solid wall
interaction parameters on trajectory are taken from point behind shock.
The main advantage of proposed method is avoiding need of a priory knowledge of
flow structure. As it can be seen from presented far results, in some cases it is principally impossible due to extra-complexity of flow. The formal character of algorithm
which consists from standard steps of solution of standards problems allow one to
calculate flow region uniformly without changing program logic for new class of
flows. The researcher needs only to know the coordinates, types and parameters of
discontinuities on initial time layer. So the suggested method has all advantages of
“shock-capturing” numerical schemes but allow obtain exact flow picture.
Of course as in any numerical scheme there are some “fitting” parameters like
number of usual characteristics in extensive expansion waves, which should be known
before calculation. Also in some cases the number of tracking discontinuities begins to
grow seriously. That results in computer memory leak. In real calculations the special

Adaptive High-Performance Method for Numerical Simulation

“destruction” procedure for tracked weak (strong) discontinuities with small difference between left and right values of gradients (parameters) is applied. Their “destruction” condition is the error of integral conservation laws.
After determination of parameters of discontinuities on the next time step the calculation of inner points in each region doesn’t depends from each other. So the proposed method can be easily adopted for parallel execution.
For nonequilibrium calculations for solution of kinetic equations takes the main part
of execution time. As it was shown in [4] it is possible to improve performance by redesign this part of program code according to vectorized computer ELECTRONIKA–
SSBIS.

4 Gas Cloud Expansion into Closed Vacuum Chamber
The features of above technique are demonstrated on case of unsteady expansion of
gas cloud of binary mixture of inert gas (argon) and condensing vapor (silver) into
closed vacuum chamber filled by residual gas (air). Such flow is realized at shock
tubes with chambers of high/low pressure, separated by membrane, at expansion of
vapors generated by electrical explosion of thin wire in cylindrical vacuum tube, at
expansion flow of substance evaporated by laser beam. The similar flows 6are considered in some astrophysical problems.
Due to high initial values of initial temperature and cooling rate the nonequilibrium
homogeneous condensation can take place in such flow.
The initial cloud radii equals to 1 mm, the chamber’s radii equals to 5 mm. The
initial pressure and temperature of silver vapor equal to 5270 Pa and 2000 K. The
pressure and temperature of residual gas equal to 10 Pa and 300 K, respectively. At
Fig. 1 the r-t diagram for this flow is presented. One can see head shock wave, running
at the low-pressure region, contact surface and centered rarefaction wave. Later head
shock wave reflects from solid wall and, after interaction with contact surface, transforms into two shock waves moving in opposite directions. The left shock wave moves
to the symmetry axis, reflects from it and comes back to solid wall. The right shock
wave interacts with solid wall and this process repeats many times. The resulting flow
has complex structure with lot of strong/weak discontinuities. As it is seen at Fig.1
that suggested numerical technique permits to receive “exact” picture of flow with all
details.
The parameterized simulation of flows for various ratios z of chamber/cloud initial
sizes and for various types of symmetry shows that for large z values the flow picture
at initial times is simpler (less number of shock waves). The reason is that reflection
of shocks from symmetry axis requires more time. Also there is difference of temperature behavior at solid wall. For z=1/5 after increase of temperature at head shock
wave it begins to decrease significantly. In case of z=1/5 the decreasing time is small
and later temperature has stable level.
Against plane case in cylindrical/spherical flows the ending right characteristic of
rarefaction wave transforms into shock wave as a result of interactions of characteristics of same family. The intensity of generated shock wave is greater in spherical case.

At Fig.2 the pressure-temperature diagram for first three trajectories behind contact
surface is present. The results agree with usual pictures for nonequilibrium homogeneous condensation in high-speed flows. Initially the active changes of cluster size
distribution function take place. But due to small values of cluster concentrations the
mixture parameters vary according to adiabatic law. After formation of enough number of clusters (Wilson point) their fast growth step begins resulting in decreasing of
super-saturation ratio. It is seen that maximal super-cooling value decreases with increasing of initial distance between trajectories and contact surface. That agrees with
known data about nonequilibrium condensation.

5 Conclusion
The suggested numerical technique can be used for wide class of 1D unsteady reacting
flows with chock waves, detonation waves and other strong/weak discontinuities. The
main advantages of above technique can be realized in case of reacting flows with
unknown structure and without reliable kinetic mechanisms due to possibility to obtain
all flow details.
