Abstract. The considered manufacturing process is modeled in both

numerical and symbolic ways, in a disjoint manner. This paper focuses
on the symbolic model of the given Discrete Event System DES. A
new method for diagnosing some symbolic parameters is presented. The
proposed diagnosis algorithms are to be performed sequentially. The simulation results show that these algorithms have improved the symbolic
part of the process model.

1 Introduction
Fault detection and isolation has received considerable attention in the literature
because it is an important task in automatic control and complex systems. Many
approaches have been applied to industrial large processes 11 or 2.
It is far from obvious to build up a complete model for a given process. Thus
dealing with incomplete knowledge is quite relevant to knowledge representation.
Various symbolic qualitative approaches have been proposed to cope with such
an incomplete knowledge including sign algebra which is the most elementary
thus incomplete way of representation.
Ambiguity is the predominant source of weakness in sign algebra and it has
been a major focus of research in qualitative reasoning like FOG 12, OM 9,
SR1 5 and ROMK 3. These are some examples of approaches that bring
improvements with regard to the classical sign algebra.
This paper focuses on a particular Discrete Event System DES which is a
manufacturing line. It transforms a raw material into a nished product. The system has a hierarchical structure that are subprocess, workcell and workstation.
The process is composed of a set of sequential subprocesses. Each subprocess is
made of a number of sequential workcells. Lastly each workcell is a set of sequential workstations. The workstation is the elementary component, typically
a machine. It is modeled in both numerical and symbolic way, but in a disjoint
manner no model overlapping.
The aim of the paper is to enhance the symbolic model, especially by detecting and isolating the uncertain or ambiguous symbols. For the rest of the
paper, uncertain and ambiguous have the same meaning that is the symbolic
value qï¿½.

Diagnosis Algorithms for a Symbolically Modeled Manufacturing Process 1229

Then a diagnosis algorithm to deal with such an uncertain information is
proposed. This is based on two sequential algorithms that are coarse diagnosis
followed by ne diagnosis.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briey presents a summary of
the previous process model, section 3 proposes the basic principles of the two
diagnosis algorithms. A discussion is given in section 4.

Preliminaries

The DES is a TV-tube manufacturing system. This has been modeled in order
to build a hierarchical control of the whole process. The system has been decomposed using a hierarchical approach that are subprocess, workcell and workstation. Each component is made of sequential sets of sub-components. A basic
specication has been dened for the most elementary element, i.e., the workstation. The basic model is summarized here: for more details see 	7, 	8, and
	14.
A workstation is the most elementary machine, typically consisting of one
processing tool, position or action. The task performed at this position is generally done by a robot. Firstly, the workstation model takes into account some
properties of classical control systems like controllability and observability. Thus
distinction has been made between control and uncontrollable parameters generally inputs as well as observable and unobservable parameters mostly outputs.
Secondly, the model is focused on the product itself, the TV-tube, but also includes some process parameters. Finally, each parameter can be of numerical or
symbolic type. These types of specication are given as follows:
- Numerical quantitative behavioral model : it mostly consists of algebraic
relations and ordinary dierential equations. This type of model is recognized to
be the best one when available. Some examples of signicant numerical variables
are the tube temperature or its rotation speed at a given machine.
- Symbolic qualitative behavioral model : it is used when the quantitative
specication is not available, either when there is not enough information most
of the cases or when the numerical information extraction is costly too expensive.
It can be noticed that the symbolic and numerical models are disjoint sets,
but the two type of parameters interact. The symbolic specication is mainly
used to deal with rough knowledge, which are represented by the following set
of symbols S = fqï¿½ qï¿½ qï¿½g. The meaning of each symbol is as follows: the sign
represents the deviation from the nominal value of a given variable. It is then
obvious that the best process model corresponds to the one where all symbolic
variables take their nominal value i.e., the symbolic value qï¿½. The sign addition
and sign multiplication are given in Table 1.

This symbolic model seemed to be not enough to model a part of the DES.
Thus the classical set S has been extended to a set S by adding an ambiguous
value qï¿½  and all alternate values Sd = fq qï¿½ qï¿½ qï¿½ q qï¿½ g. These represent the binary logical OR of two basic symbols. For details on the symbolic
specication, see 13

Diagnosis

Fault diagnosis generally consists in fault detection and then isolation. In this
work, fault is not the "usual" failure that can be found in industrial complex
systems but the ambiguous symbolic variable qï¿½.
We recall that the symbolic knowledge is expressed by the sign algebra set,
Sd = fqï¿½ qï¿½ qï¿½ g, to which additional symbols have been added. These are
alternate symbols, Sd = fqï¿½ qï¿½ qï¿½ qï¿½  qï¿½ qï¿½ g. Furthermore, once an ambiguous symbol qï¿½ appears, it is propagated to another related variables, due
to the sequential structure of the DES. The objective of the diagnostic task is
to enhance the symbolic model that is to remove all the ambiguous and all the
alternate symbols. Thus the target set after diagnosis is the set of sign algebra,
Sf = S = fqï¿½ qï¿½ qï¿½g. The ideal case would be that this target set is reduced
to the single null element fqï¿½g.
Therefore, to improve the model i.e., to remove all ambiguous and alternate
values, two simple sequential algorithms, coarse diagnosis and ne diagnosis are
proposed. The rst algorithm is devoted to the treatment of variables taking
the ambiguous value qï¿½ while the second one deals with the alternate symbols
belonging to Set Sd . These algorithms are to be performed sequentially, coarse
diagnosis rst, followed by the ne one.
3.1 Preliminary Assumptions

Some assumptions have to be made before performing such algorithms:
1. There exists at least one symbolic variable taking the ambiguous value qï¿½ at the
beginning of the simulation. Every symbolic variable taking such a value is called
an uncertain variable.
2. According to the structure of the DES and because of the use of the addition
operation, an uncertain variable will always forward its uncertain value to every
related variable in the next workstationsï¿½ .
3. For each uncertain variable, there exists at least one control action in order to
change its value this these control variables is are located only in the same
workstation  not general control variables.
4. Each control variable is numerical and is bounded, u ï¿½ 
umin umax .
5. Coarse diagnosis as well as ne diagnosis are performed o-line.

3.2 Preliminary Causal Graph

The building of the hybrid causal graph HCG is also required, before performing
the diagnostic task. One HCG is built for each workstation. The causal graph
is a set of points nodes and a set of arcs relations connecting some nodes. A
node is a real-valued or symbolic variable xi 2 R  S . A directed arc represents
a relation between the connected variables, from the causes to the e	ects.
A numerical arc is an arc where both causes and e	ects are numerical. A

This is not true if the Q-multiplication is used, because qï¿½ ï¿½ qï¿½ = qï¿½ .

is an arc for which the e

Iri et al. 6, ESDG, Enhanced Signed Directed Graphs proposed by Oyeleye and
Kramer 10 and QUAF, Qualitative Analysis of Feedback, proposed by Rose
and Kramer 15.

3.3 Coarse Diagnosis
The coarse diagnosis objective is to remove the uncertain variables from the
initial set

S

ï¿½ï¿½

. The algorithm consists in the isolation of the uncertain variable,

then the tuning of the control variable and performing the simulation. Lastly
other uncertains variables are then detected. The target set is the initial set
without the ambiguous values.

Algorithm: isolation, tuning control variable, simulation and detection
More precisely the detailed algorithm to perform such a diagnosis task is given
below:

Coarse Diagnosis

1. Initialization:
a. Isolate the first subprocess
b. Isolate the first workcell
c. Isolate the first workstation
d. Isolate the first uncertain variable i.e. q?.
2. Isolation of uncertain variable:
a. Isolate the next subprocess
b. Isolate the next workcell
c. Isolate the next workstation
d. Isolate the next uncertain variable i.e. qï¿½ .
3. Performing control action:
a. find appropriate control variable control tuning
b. determine its numerical value
c. apply control action
4. Running simulation:
5. Detection of other uncertain variables
a. if analyzed qvar is still uncertain then goto 3b.
-- -- else goto 5b.
b. if at least one uncertain variable is detected in current workstation
then goto 1d.
-- -- else goto 5c.
c. if at least one uncertain variable is detected in current workcell then
goto 2c.
-- -- else goto 5d.

d. if at least one uncertain variable is detected in current subprocess
then goto 2b.
-- -- else goto 5e.
e. if at least one uncertain variable is detected in the process then goto
2a. else end.

Some remarks can be made upon this coarse diagnosis algorithm:
- The considered uncertain variable is assumed to be an output variable and not
a process one uncertain process variable always gives rise to uncertain output
variables in the same workstationï¿½.
- It is assumed that there exists at least one uncertain variable at the beginning of the diagnosis task so that the algorithm begins with isolation instead
with detection unlike standard diagnosis: detection, then isolation

Discussion

The numerical model is represented by ordinary dierential equations, while the
symbolic model is expressed by algebraic sign relations and decision tables with
if-then rules in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. The simulation duration is
about 1 second while the eective time is 20 minutes. The simulator writes the
output variables in a specic le.
The diagnosis algorithms have been applied to a part of the manufacturing
system. This system has strong sequential properties. The simulation has been
performed to the Flowcoat Green workcell, which is a sequential collection of
twelve workstations, FG01 to FG12. The main objective of this workcell is to
put a green owcoat liquid on a blank TV tube. A signicant workstation is
the fourth one, FG04. This workstation is recognized to be signicant because
at this location is determined the amount of green owcoat liquid to be spread
which will become the green phosphor lines on the nished TV tube.
The coarse diagnosis has detected 10 ambiguous variables, while the ne
algorithm have removed 7 alternate symbols. The two diagnosis algorithms have
improved the model in the way that the rened model has a reduced number
of uncertain variables, thus reducing the total number of states of the hybrid
process. However, the proposed method only deal with the symbolic model, that
is only a part of the complete model. And the number of initial ambiguous
ï¿½

This holds since no Q-multiplication is used in the present formalism.

Diagnosis Algorithms for a Symbolically Modeled Manufacturing Process 1235

variables is relatively low because the diagnosis algorithms have been applied to
a model that has been previously tuned with other methods.
However, many assumptions have been made. The propagation of the ambiguous symbolic variable qï¿½ is observable since only the sign addition operator is
used for the symbolic model. Indeed, if the symbolic model include the use of the
multiplication operator, an ambiguous symbolic variable qï¿½ could be transformed
to qï¿½, thus making this failure unobservable. Another restrictive assumption is
the existence of a numerical control action that can be tuned in order to remove
the ambiguous variable. This could be quite dicult to obtain.

Concluding Remarks

A new method of diagnosing uncertain parameters has been presented. The
system is modeled in a disjoint numerical and symbolic way. The main idea is
to detect uncertain or ambiguous variables in order to improve the symbolic
discrete event model. The advantage of such method is the systematic checking
of uncertain variables thanks to the symbolic model of the system and also to
the sequential structure of the class of the considered discrete event system.
However the extension of this approach to another class of discrete event
systems is not straightforward because many assumptions have been made. For
example the existence of a control action that can tune the model in order to
remove the ambiguous symbolic variable is not always guaranteed. The type of
considered DES is quite a simple one. Fault diagnosis in FlowShop or JobShop
systems become more complicated due to the multiplicity of machines thus a
multiplicity of possible faults.
On-going work concerns the automatic tuning of control variable using lower
and upper bounds, where some process expertise is required. Finally the next step
is the automated diagnosis of such algorithms in order to perform the diagnostic
task on-line.
