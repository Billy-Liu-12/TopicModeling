Abstract

Detailed ignition modeling has been traditionally left out of the combustion
simulations, mainly due to its relatively small time and length scales that could
not be integrated into much larger length and time scales of combustion and
ﬂuid dynamics. Although the advancements in computing power has now made
possible to integrate ignition and combustion modeling, not many researchers
have shown interest due to the wide scope of knowledge it needs in both plasma
physics and combustion dynamics. In this paper, we are reporting a preliminary
analysis of an integrated ignition+combustion model for both spark ignition (SI)
and laser-induced spark ignition (LISI) combustion chambers. A common aspect
of both SI and LISI is the use of equation-of-state (EOS) tables at temperatures
up to 5 times higher than those assumed in most combustion codes. We report
use of an atomic physics code to generate EOS tables needed for our combustion
and ignition simulations.

Introduction

Fossil-fueled energy supply and end-use combustion systems are the cornerstone
of the industrial and commercial sectors of the U.S. economy. In order to optimize the design and operation of combustion systems, a new generation of
advanced design tools must be developed to provide the system designer and
operator with a fundamental understanding of the interaction of key operating
and design parameters. Identiﬁed as one of the grand challenge problems, combustion involves many complex phenomena including gas dynamics, chemistry,
turbulence, radiative heat transfer, sprays and ignition.
Because combustion occurs at time and length scales where chemistry and
turbulence interact, the combustion modeling and simulations face signiﬁcant
scientiﬁc challenges. Development of a computer system that can fully resolve,
numerically, all aspects of the operation of a combustor may not occur in the
foreseeable future. Instead, the approach proposed by the combustion community [1] involves a selective and systematic development of submodels that allow

”bootstrapping” from the microscopic regimes to the device-modeling regime.
In order for this approach to be successful, new knowledge in the areas of chemistry, turbulence, materials science, mathematics, and computer science need to
be discovered.
Here, we focus on development of an ignition submodel. If a reliable, and
reproducible ignition is found, this will help scientists sort out eﬀects of early ignition on combustion. This might even help studies of turbulence and turbulencecombustion interactions which are current concerns of researchers. We will limit
our focus to early ﬂame formation and its plasma characteristics.
The spatial and temporal resolutions needed to resolve the ignition source
are beyond the capability of current combustion models. Ignition takes place in
a very tiny space (microns) and in a quick time-frame (nanoseconds), however
it has a lasting eﬀect on what follows. Early ﬂame formation and propagation
has a vital impact on the system performance and emissions.

Plasma Properties of Ignition

The thermodynamic properties of hot plasma are often required in hydrodynamic
and radiative energy transport of astrophysical and fusion plasmas [2]. Although
the physical conditions in such cases seem to be far from those of an internal
combustion engine, researchers have reported very high teperatures (up to 60,000
Kelvin) and densities during the ignition process [3]. During the spark breakdown
phase, the ion density increases rapidly to values of some 1019 e/cm3 which leads
to a signiﬁcant energy loss for accelerated electrons due to Coulomb collisions
with the ions [11]. The frequency of such collisions determines the electricial
resistivity (η), which is dependent on the degree of ionization of the background
gas. We know from classical transport theory that [7,10,11] conductivity (or
resistivity) includes both the eﬀects of Coulomb collisions and electron-atom
collisions. The expression used is [11]
(1)

η = η W + ηF

where ηW is (Weak) Coulomb collision, and ηF is (Full) electron-atom collision
term as
ηF ≡ (5.799 × 10−15 ) · Z(T ) · lnΛ · T −3/2
and

1/2

ηW ≡

me σea (T ) 1/2
T
e2 α(T )

Here, σea is the electron-atom collision cross section, me is the electron mass,
e is the electron charge, Z is the average ionic charge state, T is the plasma
temperature, and α is the degree of ionization of the plasma. The degree of
ionization is a strong dependent of the plasma temperature. When the degree of
ionization falls below 0.001, the behavior of η is controlled by η W . For α greater
than 0.1, the dominant term is ηF .

Calculation of the average charge (Z), the electron-atom collision cross section (σea ), and the degree of ionization (α) is neccessary for computing plasma
resistivity which determines how much heat is deposited in the early ignition
phase. The average charge (Z) is also needed for computing the equation-ofstate (EOS)
P = (1 + Z)nkT,
which is needed to bring closure to the governing equations [4]. In most, cases,
this EOS relation is sought between the speciﬁc internal energy (e), the number
density (n), and the temperature (T ).
We use IONMIX [12] to compute the steady-state ionization and excitation
populations for a mixture of up to 10 diﬀerent atomic species. The thermodynamic properties of plasma, such as the speciﬁc energy, average charge state,
pressure, and heat capacity are also calculated. One can obtain the radiative
absorption, emission, and scattering coeﬃcients, however we are not using these
to solve any radiation transport equations at this stage of our work.
The ionization populations for IONMIX are computed for steady-state conditions. The atomic processes considered are collisional ionization, radiative recombination, dielectronic recombination, and collisional recombination. IONMIX
uses ionization potentials given at Nuclear Data Tables [12] for about 15 elements. The user must supply an ionization potential for elements outside of this
range.
Several aspects of ignition modeling are being considered here are: the
amount of energy deposition, the resistivity model, and the EOS data at high
temperatures. Most of these issues are common for both SI and LISI, however
the EOS data goes to the heart of our approach. The energy deposition for
SI is computed through the solution of electromagnetic equations and we have
presented this, at least for 1-D at an earlier publication [4]. The energy deposition for LISI is rather an estimate base on experiments [15]. All of our SI
and LISI computations have been integrated as sub-models into the KIVA-3 engine combustion code [13]. To our knowledge, these SI and LISI models were
ﬁrst attempts to examine the inﬂuence of a computed ignition model, instead
of a semi-emprical approach, on combustion output. Here, we are attempting to
measure the inﬂuence of a well-expanded EOS data for both SI and LISI. Our
database for chemical reactions (kinetic and equilibrium) is currently following
the data available in KIVA-3. However, this database need to be expanded to
higher temperatures than currently available.

Results

Our one-dimensional spark-ignition model described in [4] along with expanded
EOS tables described here and in [12] has been integrated into the standard
KIVA-3 code [6,13]. We examined the combustion output (i.e., temperature,
N Ox density) against ignition energy variations. The new EOS data obtained
for high temperatures via IONMIX has been used to check the variations in

combustion output. This section lists preliminary results for both SI and LISI
cases.

We examine the inﬂuence of added plasma properties and equations in our
simulations. These new properties include 1) computation of ignition energy
source via Maxwell’s equations [4], 2) use of new EOS data from IONMIX, 3) a
new resisitivity model to compute spark current density. A comparison is made
to a test case using the standard KIVA-3 without any such plasma properties.
These results have been obtained on a baseline engine with a spark plug
centrally located at the cylinder head. Temporal and spatial data was obtained
at every 5 degree crank angle for a computational mesh of approximately 5,500
elements. The engine speciﬁcations can be found in [6,13]. The enormity of the
data makes visualization a necessity for scientiﬁc interpretation. The standard
KIVA-3 output was converted to a format accepted by the AVS post-processing
software.
We include a summary of our observations via Fig. 2 and 3 for diﬀerent
fuel amount and varying spark current. In these ﬁgures, we present peak values of

temperature (T), and N Ox density at the ignition region. It is obvious that our
plasma-enhanced simulations (Case B,C,D) show a more elevated peak temperature than the classic KIVA-3 run (Case A) with a simpler ignition source and
limited EOS data. The diﬀerence between Case A and B (which have the same
fuel amount and the same spark current) is almost seventy percent. This diﬀerence is signiﬁcant enough to lead to an entirely diﬀerent NOx and fuel density
proﬁles. We expect that a signiﬁcant part of the temperature diﬀerence comes
from the use of new EOS tables that enable us to move into a high temperature
region rather than cutting it oﬀ at the 5, 000 Kelvins as the KIVA-3 code does.
Contrary to several assumptions in previous modeling eﬀorts, temporal and
spatial variations of the spark plasma properties are important source of inﬂuence on the ﬂame dynamics and subsequent combustion. These results justify
a more comprehensive approach to account for the high temperature aspects
of ignition. They also indicate that the evolution of ignition and its interaction
with combustion should be taken into account.
4.2

LISI

Although experimental data from LISI clearly shows spatial and temporal variations [15], we assume a ﬁxed energy source during the ignition window. Furthermore, the source term is Δe = (P/ρ) · Δt, where P is the laser energy deposition
rate (ergs/s.cm3 ), ρ is the total density, and Δt is the duration of the laser pulse.
Although the laser lasts only 5-10 nanoseconds, Δt here might be as low as as
one nanosecond. In that case, the sum of all the Δe values during the ignition
window would give the total ignition source energy deposition. The use of small
Δt is to prevent numerical instabilities that could arise from a high deposition
rate. The laser energy deposition rate used here is 5 × 1016 ergs/s.cm3 , which
deposits about a fraction of a Joule energy in the combustion chamber in the
5-10 nanosecond timeframe.
We examine the eﬀect of an expanded EOS data on the combustion output.
As it is in the SI case, the temperature in the combustion chamber is the most
aﬀected physical quantity. A comparison of temperature, N Ox Density, and the
Fuel Density for two cases is presented in Figures 4,5, and 6. One of these two
cases represents original EOS data, which is below 5, 000 Kelvins. The other
case is for expanded EOS data beyond 5, 000 Kelvins. It seems the temperature
diﬀerence between these two cases leads to a diﬀerent level of fuel consumption,
and N Ox production. In the expanded EOS case, the temperatures in the ignition
region are allowed to rise, therefore leading to more fuel consumption and N O x
production. In the ﬁgures shown here, the N Ox density is much higher for limited
EOS case in the central region due to a higher fuel density at that time compared
to expanded EOS case. In the expanded EOS case, more fuel is burned earlier.
The produced N Ox leaves the center of chamber. The overall N Ox production
is therefore still higher for the expanded EOS case.
Since the eﬀect of temperature is so high on fuel consumption and N Ox
production, among other things, it is important that we conduct an accurate
solution, particularly in the use of EOS data. If the chamber temperature is

Plasma Modeling of Ignition for Combustion Simulations

much higher than what we believed in, then this will lead to an underestimation
of pollutants and wear and tear of chamber equipment.

Conclusion

It is noted that temperatures in the ignition area are many times higher than
those in the rest of the combustion chamber. Detailed ignition modeling is needed
to enhance accuracy of combustion simulations. The equation of state (EOS)
data as well as the reaction rate tables need to be updated to include temepratures up to at least 10, 000 − 20, 000 Kelvins. The use of an tomic physics code
(IONMIX) here has been justiﬁed as there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in results
when we use an expanded EOS data. We will report further results in future
publications. The ignition sub-model and the expanded EOS tables will be modularized to be used with other combustion codes.
