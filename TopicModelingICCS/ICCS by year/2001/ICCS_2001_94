Abstract. There are many interesting problems in musical acoustics
that can only be dealt with via computational methods. For the most
part, the essential physics is readily accessible at an introductory level,
making this an excellent source of examples and research projects for
undergraduate students. This theme is illustrated with a quick tour of
the issues encountered in modeling the guitar.

Introduction

Computers have been associated with music for many decades. This association
has been quite extensive, and has included the analysis and composition of music, as well as the synthesis of musical tones. The synthesis problem has been
attacked in several ways; computers can be used to make sounds that cannot
be produced by any known musical instrument, and they can be used to mimic
speciﬁc instruments so as to perform compositions that could not be played by
a single performer with a conventional instrument (e.g., a twelve voice fugue).
In this paper we explore one particular aspect of the synthesis problem: the
construction of a musical tone.
There are several diﬀerent ways in which a computer can mimic the tones
produced by a particular instrument. To a ﬁrst approximation, most musical
tones are composed of a collection of harmonic waveforms, so it is possible to assemble an approximate musical tone by combining sinusoids according to various
recipes. However, this is not an easy way to obtain tones that sound realistic. The
time dependence of the harmonic content, especially during the initial portion
of the tone, is extremely diﬃcult to characterize and copy, and the component
waveforms are often not precisely harmonic. Another approach is to record typical waveforms from a real instrument and then construct other tones for the
instrument (e.g., at a diﬀerent pitch or loudness level) by algorithmically altering the sampled waveforms. These two approaches, which loosely speaking can be
termed additive synthesis and sampling synthesis, are widely used. However, improvements in computer power are now making possible a third approach known
as physical modeling. This approach involves computational modeling of the instrument using fundamental physics, i.e., Newton’s laws. (Quantum mechanics
and relativity do not appear to play signiﬁcant roles in musical acoustics.) The
underlying physics of these simulations is relatively elementary, and many of the

key concepts, including the wave equation, the vibration of ﬂexible strings, and
Fourier analysis, are well within the grasp of undergraduate students. As a result, this ﬁeld aﬀords many opportunities for interesting, original, and forefront
research projects for undergraduates.
Our group has been involved for several years in physical modeling of the
piano [1,2]. That work has included simulations of various components of the
piano along with experiments to test and reﬁne the simulations. In this paper
we describe the beginnings of a similar project for the guitar. Note that there
has previously been some interesting and very insightful modeling of the guitar
by Richardson and coworkers [3,4,5]. Our approach diﬀers from Richardson’s in
several ways, the most important being that our calculations are carried out in
the time domain (Richardson et al. worked in the frequency domain) which tends
to make things more intuitive, and in our opinion this will be a more convenient
route to the ultimate goal of a complete and playable a numerical guitar.

Overview of the Guitar and Modeling Strategy

Figure 1 contains a schematic drawing of an acoustic guitar showing the major
elements of the model. All motion starts with the strings. Here we show only
one string; it is secured on the left at a point just beyond the bridge, and on
the right at a tuning peg. The portion of the string that is free to vibrate (the
“speaking length”) extends from the bridge to one of the frets; our ﬁgure shows
just one fret, but there are actually many spaced along the neck (although at a
given moment only one comes into contact with the string). The player controls
which fret is in contact with the string, thereby adjusting the speaking length
and hence the frequency of vibration. The string is set into motion when it is
plucked by the player. This results in a time dependent force on the bridge, that
drives the soundboard. The sides and back of the body also vibrate, but they
are thicker than the soundboard and so vibrate much less [6]. The motion of
the soundboard also causes the air inside the body to move, and the combined
soundboard/air resonator has several strongly coupled modes [7]. This motion
of the body of the instrument results in the sound that we hear.

A complete computational model of the guitar must deal with the vibrations
of the string, the soundboard, the air in the cavity, and the air surrounding the

body. Such a complete model has not yet been constructed, although Richardson
and coworkers [3,4,5] have carried out a detailed analysis of the body vibrations
without the air, along with a treatment of the outgoing sound produced by the
body alone. In this paper we will describe how one can deal with the string
and the soundboard to obtain an (approximate) estimate of the resulting sound
pressure. The vibrations of strings and plates are “elementary” problems that
are seen in most mechanics courses at the sophomore or junior level. However,
we will see that it is necessary to go a bit beyond the simplest descriptions of
strings and plates to construct a modestly realistic numerical guitar.

The Flexible String: Solving the Wave Equation

The string is perhaps the key element of our simulation, since it is the origin of
the driving force for all of the other components of the instrument. The equation
of motion for an ideal ﬂexible string is just the usual wave equation
T ∂2y
∂2y
=
,
∂t2
µ ∂x2

(1)

where y is the string displacement, x is position as measured along the string,
T is the tension, and µ is the mass per unit length. It is well known that
� the
solutions to this equation are undamped waves that move at a speed c = T /µ.
We have previously described an exact, numerical, time domain solution of this
equation [8], so we will not repeat all of the details here (see also [9,10]). The
general approach is to discretize both x and t, in steps of Δx and Δt respectively,
so that y(x, t) → y(iΔx, nΔt) → y(i, n), where i and n are integers. The partial
derivatives in (1) can then be written in terms of y(i, n), y(i ± 1, n), etc., in the
usual way [8,9]. This equation can be rearranged to obtain y(i, n + 1) in terms
of y(i, n) and y(i, n − 1); i.e., the string displacement at spatial location i at the
next time step n+1 can be calculated from knowledge of the string displacement
at previous time steps (n and n − 1).
This explicit method is very fast, and much more convenient than alternative
implicit methods [11]. Moreover, this explicit method is in this case exact, provided that the two step sizes are chosen so that Δx/Δt = c. A simple physical
interpretation of this point was given in [8].
Some typical results obtained with this computational approach are shown
in Fig. 2. The initial string displacement was a perfect “pluck” (i.e., triangle)
as shown in the top proﬁle in the ﬁgure. Successive plots show how this initial
proﬁle breaks up, with kinks traveling left and right. Note also the succession
of many small kinks in the central region. These are due discreteness eﬀects in
combination with the assumption of a sharp kink at the plucking point. Such
a singularity is, of course, unphysical; no string is perfectly ﬂexible and the
inevitable stiﬀness will always round oﬀ the kink. Moreover, when a player plucks
the string she will always produce a somewhat rounded proﬁle due to the ﬁnite
size of her ﬁnger or pick.

Fig. 2. Snapshots of the string pro le for a ﬂexible string. The string parameters were
chosen to match the string B3 of a typical acoustic guitar. The string length was
0.65 m, the diameter 0.24 mm, the density 8000 kg/m3 (as for steel), and the tension
was 149 N (to obtain the desired frequency of ∼ 247 Hz). The results show (from top
to bottom) the string pro le at t = 0, t = 0.25 ms, t = 0.50 ms, etc., with successive
results displaced downwards for clarity. The spatial step size was Δx = 0.65 mm.

This rounding of the initial string proﬁle can easily be included by simply
smoothing oﬀ the initial y(x), and the results of a similar calculation with a
slightly smoothed initial pluck are shown in Fig. 3. On the scale visible here it
does not matter much how one does the smoothing (i.e., with a gaussian convolution or a much simpler smoothing algorithm). As expected, the unphysical
diﬃculty with the kinks is now removed.

Adding Stiﬀness Leads to Anharmonicity

As noted in the previous section, all strings have at least some stiﬀness, the origin
of which can be understood by considering a very thick (large diameter) string.
If such a string is bent, there will be a restoring force due to the compression
and stretching of the string on the inside and outside of the bend. This force is
proportional to the Young’s modulus [6,12], and is independent of the tension.
When this force is included the equation of motion becomes [6]

where E is the Young’s modulus, r is the radius of the wire, and we have assumed
a circular cross-section.
For a typical guitar string the stiﬀness term is small, but it has some important consequences. Physically the stiﬀness makes the string dispersive, as the

wave speed now depends on the frequency. As we will see in a moment, this will
have a small but very important eﬀect on the spectrum and the nature of the
guitar tone. Computationally the stiﬀness term aﬀects the accuracy and stability
of our time domain/ﬁnite diﬀerence algorithm. As we have discussed elsewhere
[9], it is no longer possible to choose the ratio of the time steps as Δx/Δt = c;
doing so would lead to an unstable (divergent) algorithm due to the presence
of vibrations that move faster than c. Choosing the ratio of the step sizes to
be r × c with r > 1 yields a stable solution if r is suﬃciently large (just how
large depends on the size of the stiﬀness term in (2)). While this yields a stable
solution, the algorithm is now no longer exact [11]. Fortunately the algorithmic
errors are very small for the cases we will be considering; in a plot like Fig. 3
this error is essentially unresolvable.
Let us now return to the physical consequences of the stiﬀness term. The
dispersion that it introduces means that our string is no longer a perfectly harmonic vibrator. For a ﬂexible string the normal modes follow the well known
pattern fn = nf1 where f1 is the fundamental frequency. For our stiﬀ string the
modal frequencies become fn = nf1 + βn3 , where β is proportional to E (note
that f1 is also slightly diﬀerent from the value for a ﬂexible string) [6]. Hence
the modes are no longer harmonically related, but the higher modes are shifted
systematically to higher frequencies. This is the source of the eﬀect known as
“octave stretching” in pianos [6,9].
The magnitude of this anharmonicity can be seen from the spectrum of the
sound produced by our string. Actually, our model is not yet complete enough
to calculate the sound directly, since we have not yet considered how to compute
the sound pressure. We will therefore rely on the simple but reasonably accu-

1046

N. Giordano and J. Roberts

rate observation that the sound pressure produced by a vibrating soundboard is
approximately proportional to the velocity of the bridge. We have veriﬁed this
by experiments and calculations for the piano [13,2], and expect it to also be a
reasonable approximation for the guitar. However, in order for us to calculate
the sound in this manner we must have a model of the soundboard and bridge.
We now consider an extremely crude model; we will return to this problem and
give a better description of the soundboard in the next section.
The mechanical impedance Z of an object is deﬁned as
Z≡

F
,
v

(3)

where F is the applied force and v the velocity of the object. Usually one considers a harmonic force (so that v is at the same frequency); then Z is in general
frequency dependent and complex. We have shown through experimental and
computational studies that to a ﬁrst approximation one may treat the impedance
of a soundboard as a frequency independent (and real) constant [1,14]. In this
case (3) then also becomes the time domain equation of motion of the bridge and
soundboard. Independent calculations (to be discussed below) and experiments
[15,6,7] give an approximate value of Z = 100 kg/s for a guitar soundboard.
Combining this soundboard description (3) with our string enables us to
calculate the sound produced by our guitar. The soundboard position is obtained
by integrating its velocity as derived from (3) using a ﬁnite diﬀerence (Euler)
method. The force on the soundboard is just the product of the string tension
and the slope of the string at the end attached to the bridge. This end moves
with the bridge, coupling energy out of the string.
Some results for the sound are given in Fig. 4 which shows the spectra for
both a ﬂexible and a stiﬀ steel guitar string. On this scale the two spectra
are indistinguishable. The relative amplitudes of the diﬀerent modes can be
understood in terms of the initial plucked proﬁle [9,6].
In order to better show the eﬀect of the stiﬀness, Fig. 5 shows a greatly expanded view of the spectrum in the neighborhood of the 12th “harmonic” (it
may be properly termed a harmonic only for the ﬂexible string; more generally
these modes are termed “partials”). As promised, the frequency of this partial
for the stiﬀ string is shifted slightly above that of the ﬂexible string. The frequency diﬀerence is only about 1 Hz, and is thus not large. However, the eﬀect
is noticeable to a listener [6].

A Slightly Realistic Soundboard

While the eﬀect of string stiﬀness can be observed from spectral analysis, it is
extremely useful to evaluate the calculated tones by simply listening to them.
Unfortunately this is not possible with the printed version of this paper, but can
be easily accommodated by visiting our www site (see the URL given above).
Such listening tests reveal (in our opinion) that the tones produced by our model
are surprisingly good considering the very simple way in which the soundboard

was included and the sound pressure derived. Perhaps the most serious weakness
of these calculated tones is with the attack; the initial portion of the tone is too
“dull” as it seems to turn on instantaneously [16]. This is not surprising, since the
soundboard model (3) is eﬀectively massless. That is, it has no inertia so it will
respond instantly, with no delay, to the force from the string. A real soundboard
will have inertia, and this will cause the soundboard motion and also the sound
pressure to build up gradually during the initial portion of the tone.
Let us therefore consider how a more realistic soundboard can be incorporated into our guitar model. The equation of motion of a thin (sound)board is
[12,1]

where z is the displacement of board, the plate lies in the x − y plane (not to
be confused with the variables x and y associated with the string), D x , Dy , and
Dxy are stiﬀness factors that are functions of the Young’s moduli (and which are
anisotropic), νx and νy are Poisson’s ratios, h is the thickness of the board, ρ is
its density, and Fs (x, y) is proportional to the force of the string on the bridge.
This equation can be attacked in the same manner as (1) with a explicit
ﬁnite diﬀerence approach, the details of which have been given elsewhere in
the context of the piano [1,2]. A real guitar soundboard has ribs which add
stiﬀness to the board in selected regions, and one rib is shown schematically in
Fig. 1. Our soundboard model includes several ribs and also contains a damping
term to account for energy loss within the board. Space does not permit more
discussion of this soundboard model here, but details of similar calculations are
given elsewhere [1,2].
Some results for the sound pressure, again assuming that the sound pressure is proportional to the velocity of the bridge, are given in Fig. 6. Here we
show the early part of the sound waveform, i.e., the “attack,” for both the crude
soundboard (3) and the improved model (4). The two results are quite diﬀerent, even though the spectra (not shown here) are actually rather similar. The
diﬀerences are due to two sources. The mechanical impedance that results from
(4) is complex and frequency dependent (although its average value is close to
Z = 100 kg/s). In addition, this soundboard has inertia so it takes some time
for the sound waveform to reach an approximately steady state form; here we
see that this takes several periods, or around 20 ms. For the crude soundboard
there is no inertia and the steady state is reached immediately.

Future Directions

The best way to evaluate the success of these modeling eﬀorts is to listen to
the calculated tones. A visit to our www site will allow the reader to judge for
herself. In our opinion the results are quite encouraging; it is certainly possible
to mistake the calculated tones for a real guitar.

model (3) (solid curve), and from the more realistic model (4) (dotted curve). The
simulation parameters were the same as those given in connection with Fig. 2.

Even so, there is much that could and should be added to make this a more
realistic calculation. Modeling the entire body of the instrument, including the
air cavity, is needed; experiments have shown that the lowest few modes of the
air in the cavity and the soundboard mix strongly at frequencies of a few hundred
Hz [7]. A direct calculation of the sound pressure in the surrounding air is also
needed. Such a calculation has been accomplished in the frequency domain for
an anechoic room (i.e., a room with reﬂectionless walls) [4,5], but a time domain
calculation in a more realistic environment would clearly be of interest, and
seems quite feasible.
Nearly all of the basic physics involved in this project is at the level of
sophomore or junior level mechanics, and hence these modeling projects can be
readily undertaken by undergraduate students (and professors!). Calculations of
this type are also at the forefront of current research in musical acoustics, as
witnessed by the increasing interest in physical modeling of musical instruments
[3,17,18,19,20,21,2].
