Abstract. Towards the realization of a global coupled air/ocean/ice predictive
system for Navy needs, two high resolution modeling efforts are underway
whose goals are the development and upgrading of the ocean and sea ice components. A 0.1°, 40-level global configuration of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory (LANL) Parallel Ocean Program (POP) integration is being performed on an IBM SP3; this is the first time an ocean simulation of this size has
been carried out. The Polar Ice Prediction System (PIPS) 3.0 uses a 1/12°, 45level grid and covers all the northern ice-covered regions. The latter model and
a 0.1°, 40-level North Atlantic only POP integration are compared with coarser
resolution runs and observations, demonstrating the importance of high resolution to the representation of ocean circulation. Mean volume and heat transports
into the Arctic are realistically simulated by PIPS 3.0.

1 Introduction
State-of-the-art super-computer technologies are providing the US Navy with the
means to progress towards the realization of their vision of a high resolution operational global air/ocean/ice system for the prediction of environmental conditions. An
understanding of the atmosphere-ice-ocean states and their variability in the form of
short-term predictions of weather, ocean, and ice conditions are important to daily
Naval operations and critical in the battlespace environment. Part of the modernization effort in the Navy involves the development of improved codes for ocean and sea
ice simulations, which employ the best representations of sub-grid scale physical
processes while taking advantage of available computer resources.
Two parallel efforts are underway that are making progress towards these goals by
developing and upgrading the ocean and sea ice components of this future coupled
Navy environmental prediction system. The spin-up of a global 1/10°, 40-level ocean
model is underway; upon completion it will be delivered to the Fleet Numerical MeV.N. Alexandrov et al. (Eds.): ICCS 2001, LNCS 2073, pp. 1098−1107, 2001.

teorological and Oceanographic Center (FNMOC) for testing and transition to the operational environment. The Polar Ice Prediction System (PIPS) 3.0, which will replace
PIPS 2.0 providing forecasts of ice conditions in the Northern Hemisphere, uses a
1/12°, 45-level grid and covers the northern ice-covered oceans. It is currently being
transitioned for operational use.
The ocean model being used in both the global and PIPS prediction systems is the
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model. It is
a primitive equation z-level model with a free-surface boundary condition. Approximations to the governing fluid dynamics equations permit a decoupling of the model
solution into barotropic (vertically averaged) and baroclinic (deviations from vertically averaged) components; these are solved using an implicit elliptic scheme and an
explicit parabolic equation system, respectively. It is written in Fortran90 and was
designed to run on multi-processor machines using domain decomposition in latitude
and longitude. MPI is used for inter-processor communications on distributed memory machines and SHMEM on shared memory machines. Further technical details and
references regarding the code and its adaptation for massively parallel computers can
be obtained from http://climate.acl.lanl.gov. The sea ice model in PIPS3.0 is configured on the same grid as the ocean model. A system of ice model equations is solved
as a set of coupled, initial/boundary value problems using a staggered Arakawa-B
gird. Details of numerical approach in this model can be found in Bitz (2000).
Benchmarking shows POP to be highly scalable onto a large number of processors
provided the processor sub-grid is large enough (Figure 1). Timings of a flat-bottom
test case where the number of grid points correspond to the sizes of global grids with
horizontal resolutions of 0.1°, 0.2°, and 0.4°, and 40 vertical levels were made on an
IBM SP3 (Navy Oceanographic Office) using 160, 320, 500, and 600 processors. The
barotropic mode is less scalable at lower resolutions and higher number of processors.
In the 0.4° case the barotropic mode dominates the total run-time for all but the smallest number of processors. This is caused by too much time being spend in communication among nodes relative to that in calculation on each node. To improve performance of the barotropic model and to increase on-node performance by a factor of two
numerical improvements are underway using an OpenMP/MPI hybrid scheme.
Any ocean model to be used in these coupled prediction systems must be capable
of producing spatial scales between 10 and 1000 km and temporal scales up to several
months. One of the challenges facing us therefore, has been the trade-off between
adequate model resolution and the availability of computing resources. Through a
Department of Defense (DOD) High Performance Computing Modernization Office
(HPCMO) Grand Challenge Grant, we have been able to perform these very realistic
simulations that hitherto have not been possible. Results presented here reflect these

challenges and concentrate on improvements from high resolution and added physics.

2 A High-Resolution Global Ocean POP simulation
Ocean models used for Navy prediction purposes must be able to realistically reproduce the statistical nature of the surface circulation. Prior to committing to a chosen
resolution for the global simulation, quantitative measures of the realism of this flow
were calculated from two Mercator configurations of POP: a recent 0.1°, 40-level
North Atlantic only simulation and a 0.28°, 20-level near-global case run several
years ago at LANL (Maltrud et al., 1998). If the statistics from the higher resolution
POP were only slightly more realistic than those from the coarser run, then large
computational savings can be made using lower resolution. Both models were forced
with daily winds and monthly climatological heat fluxes. An explicit mixed-layer
formulation, K-profile Parameterization (KPP), was active in the North Atlantic POP.
The evaluations of the ocean models were performed using the North Atlantic

Towards a Coupled Environmental Prediction System 1101

surface drifter data set for the years 1993-1997; the spatial and temporal coverage of
these drifters is extensive, providing an excellent database from which to calculate
statistics of the surface circulation. The drifter tracks and the numerical trajectories
from the 0.28 ° and 0.1° POP runs from 1995 and 1996 are seen in Figures 2a, b, and
c, respectively; two years only are plotted so that details can be seen clearly. Specifics
of the realism of these surface trajectories are discussed further in McClean et al.
(2001). Here, it is sufficient to state that the coverage of the domain by the 0.28° POP
trajectories displays many gaps and is not uniform, unlike the observations. Also
many of the trajectories preferentially follow coherent flows. The coverage by the
0.1° trajectories is much more extensive arising from the increased mesoscale eddy
activity in the higher resolution model. Additionally, the pathways and structure of
the currents are more faithfully represented in the higher resolution case. Quantitative
calculations supported these qualitative findings. Eulerian results showed that flow
features in the coarser run were unrealistic or misplaced and the variability was underrepresented relative to the observations; in the 0.1° POP the variability and current
structures were much more realistically simulated. The intrinsic Lagrangian (trajectory-based) scales from the 0.1° POP were not statistically different from the observed
quantities, while those from the 0.28° model did differ.
Based on these and other results (Bryan et al., 1998), it was decided that a global
simulation to be used for synoptic forecasting would require horizontal and vertical
resolutions of at least 0.1° and 40 vertical levels, respectively. Such a simulation is
underway using 500 processors on the IBM SP3 at the Navy Oceanographic Office.
The model uses a displaced pole grid whereby the North Pole is rotated into Hudson
Bay avoiding the issue of the polar singularity. The grid consists of 3600x2400x40
grid points with 0.1° at the equator. A blended bathymetry was created from Sandwell
and Smith (1997, http://topex.ucsd.edu/marine_topo), International Bathymetric Chart
of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO, Jakobsson et al., 2000), and British Antarctic Survey
(BEDMAP, http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/bedmap) products. The model was initialized
using the Navys MODAS 1/8° January climatology outside of the Arctic and the
University of Washingtons Polar Hydrography winter climatology in the Arctic
(http://psc.apl.washington.edu/Climatology.html). Surface momentum, heat, and salinity fluxes were calculated using bulk formulae based on the model surface temperature and an atmospheric state comprised of daily and monthly data from a variety
of sources (as in Large et al., 1997). These fluxes are used to force the model during
the current twenty-year spin-up. The KPP mixed layer formulation is active.
Figure 3 shows sea surface temperature and sea surface height fields from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively, at the end of the first year of the spin-up. Gulf
Stream and equatorial fronts are clearly seen in the Atlantic and mesoscale activity

associated with the Agulhas Current offshore of east Africa is apparent. The separation of the Kuroshio off Japan is also observed. Output from the spin-up is being
monitored to watch the set-up of the major currents, the impact of outflows on the
thermohaline circulation, and the development of water masses. Following the spinup, the model will be forced with realistic Navy surface forcing for the better part of a
decade for the purposes of understanding features and processes important to the
Navy in many different parts of the globe.

3 PIPS 3.0 Model Description and Results
The PIPS 3.0 model is configured on a 1/12o (~9 km) rotated spherical coordinate
grid. The model domain (Figure 4) extends from the North Pacific at ~30oN, through
the Arctic Ocean into the North Atlantic to ~40oN. The model bathymetry incorporates the 2.5-km resolution IBCAO digital bathymetry data set. It is represented by 45
z-coordinate levels. The model is considered to be eddy-permitting as features down
to 40-50 km can be resolved. With the radius of deformation in the Arctic Ocean approaching 10 km, many of the smaller features are still not properly accounted for.
The high resolution combined with the pan-Arctic domain allows the representation
of most of the important processes in the Arctic Ocean and realistic exchanges between the North Pacific, the Arctic Ocean, and the North Atlantic.
The sea ice model at present uses viscous-plastic rheology and the zero-layer approximation of heat conduction through ice. The ongoing upgrade of this model inclu-

des a Lagrangian formulation for calculating multi-category ice thickness distribution,
a snow layer, a non-linear profile of temperature and salinity (Bitz 2000) and a Coulombic yield curve for the viscous-plastic rheology (Hibler and Schulson, 2000).
Animations of ice concentration (Figure 4) and thickness fields
(www.oc.nps.navy.mil/~pips3) show realistic details of the annual ice structure, including oriented leads in the Western Arctic, polynyas in the Bering and Chukchi
seas, and seasonal ice-edge advancement/retreat in the marginal seas of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic. The position and structure of the ice edge position in
those regions appears to be significantly influenced by the ocean dynamics and water
mass properties (Zhang et., 1999).
In an effort to balance the net flow of water from the Pacific Ocean into the Arctic
Ocean, a 500-m deep, 162-km wide channel was created through North America connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean (Figure 4). Along the channel, westward wind forcing is prescribed at the ocean surface but otherwise the flow through
the channel and through Bering Strait is not prescribed. This approach results in a net
mean transport of 0.65 Sv during the model spin-up (Figure 5) which is reasonably
close to the observed mean flow through the Bering Strait of 0.83 Sv.
Preliminary regional comparisons of eddy kinetic energy with our earlier 18-km
version of the coupled ice-ocean model (Maslowski et al., 2000) reveal on average a
tenfold increase in eddy kinetic energy in the 9-km model (Figure 6). Most importantly the large scale ocean circulation, which strongly influences the sea ice thickness

and concentration especially in marginal ice zones, is properly represented in this
model. The narrow boundary currents associated with the continental margins of the
deep central Arctic Ocean are only 100-150 km wide but they are believed to be the
main sources of heat and salt advected northward from the North Atlantic. These predominantly barotropic flows are by definition strongly dependent on bathymetry (e.g.
shelf slopes and submarine ridges), which provides another argument for using high
resolution to resolve details of the bottom topography and boundary current flows.
One of the pathways of Atlantic Water transport into the Arctic Ocean includes the
flow through the Barents Sea. We have analyzed monthly, seasonal and annual volume and property transports through the Barents Sea in order to evaluate model results in comparison with observations from this region. The calculated fluxes depend
crucially on the inflow of heat and salt from the Norwegian Sea via the North Cape
Current and on seasonal ice melt and growth in the Barents Sea. The modified Atlantic Water leaves the region primarily through the St. Anna Trough and it significantly
affects Arctic Ocean water mass structure. The model realistically simulates known
circulation and water mass characteristics as well as the seasonally dependent ice
edge position in the Barents Sea. Results indicate an annual volume transport of 3.9
Sv and heat transport of 95TW into the Barents Sea, between Svalbard and Norway.

seph Land and Novaya Zemlya are 3.2 Sv and 16.6 TW, respectively. The magnitudes
of the model transports agree well with observations. Continued integration using
1979-1999 daily varying interannual forcing will allow model-data comparison of interannual variability, including possible trends or regime shifts in response to large
scale changes in the atmospheric weather patterns.

Conclusions
Results from two high resolution modeling efforts are presented to demonstrate the
importance of high resolution in simulating the ocean and sea-ice circulation. Details
of the 0.1°, 40-level global POP spin-up were provided along with initial results that
showed the model to be realistically simulating surface frontal structures and mesoscale activity, both of which are very important to Navy prediction needs. In PIPS 3.0,
mean volume and heat transports associated with the main pathways into the Arctic
were found to be realistic compared with observations. Improvements to the sea ice
model are likely to produce both more realistic ice configurations and seasonal-tointerannual variability in the multi-year ice cover.
