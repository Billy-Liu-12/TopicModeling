Abstract. This paper describes the development of an Infrared Scene Projector
Digital Model (IDM). The IDM is a product being developed for the Common
High Performance Computing Software Support Initiative (CHSSI) program
under the Integrated Modeling and Test Environments (IMT) Computational
Technology Area (CTA). The primary purpose of the IDM is to provide a
software model of an Infrared Scene Projector (IRSP). Initial utilization of the
IDM will focus on developing non-uniformity correction algorithms, which will
be implemented to correct the inherent non-uniformity of resistor array based
IRSPs. Emphasis here is placed on how IRSP effects are modeled in the IDM.

1 General Description of an Infrared Scene Projector (IRSP)
In general, an IRSP can be broken down into the interaction between the following
subsystems/components: a Software Control Subsystem (SCS), a Computer Image
Generator Subsystem (CIGS), a Control Electronics Subsystem (CES), an
Environmental Conditioning Subsystem (ECS), an Infrared Emission Subsystem
(IRES), a Projection Optics Subsystem (POS), a Non-Uniformity Correction
Subsystem (NUCS), a Mounting Platform Subsystem (MPS) and a System Under
Test (SUT). Figure 1 provides an overview block diagram illustration of an IRSP.
This figure also illustrates the typical interaction between the subsystems. Not all of
these interactions are required; some are for ease of use, configuration management,
system safety, or other specific needs. It is unlikely that any given IRSP utilizes all of
the illustrated interfaces.
A more detailed description of each of these subsystems is provided in the
simultaneously published companion paper: “Infrared Scene Projector Digital Model
Development”.

2 IRSP Digital Model (IDM) Mathematical Description
The primary purpose of the IDM is to provide a digital model of the IRSP process
allowing for NUC algorithm development while freeing up the actual hardware for
utilization. The IDM will assume as input a temporal sequence of 2D digital image
pixels with a 16-bit depth, the typical output of the CIGS. In other words, the IDM
will not model the intricate process of actually generating the 2D rendered images.
The IDM will provide as output a temporal sequence of 2D digital image pixels
equivalent to the output of the NUCS camera or SUT. The bit depth of the output
image will be dependent on the sensor. For example, the Agema 1000LR NUCS
camera provides a 12-bit output digital image.
2.1 IDM CIGS Model
For IDM purposes, the CIGS is modeled simply as a sequence of two dimensional
imagery. This is represented here as the image array DD02[ , ].
2.2 IDM CES Model
For drive electronics systems that are used to exercise the Honeywell type resistor
array, the 16-bit digital image signal is converted to analog drive voltages. This
conversion is not perfect and therefore comes with a loss in resolution. For drive
electronics systems that are used to exercise the Santa Barbara Infrared (SBIR) type
resistor array, the 16-bit digital image signal is driven directly into the digital input of
the resistor array. This effectively provides a lossless data path to the array. It should
be noted that on the chip these digital signals are converted to analog signals to

542

actually drive the resistor elements. This lossy effect has been described by SBIR as
having the effect of adding equivalent noise to reduce the resolution of the system to
14.5 bits.
2.2.2 Example Detailed CES Model Description of CSA Electronics
Equation 1 provides a mathematical model describing the data path of DDO2 input
16-bit digital imagery through the drive electronics built by Computer Science and
Applications (CSA). The output of this example CES model is the 2D array AIE[ , ],
which has units of voltage.

2.3 IDM ECS Model
As in a real IRSP, the IDM ECS acts primarily as a service unit. The ECS parameters
(vacuum, IRES temperature, POS temperature, prevailing environment temperature
…) will be used to establish the necessary radiometric properties of the IRES, POS,
and NUCS/SUT. The ECS set-points are considered to be temporally stationary
(constant). However, due to the response and control loop(s) of real systems, there
will be some drift and/or “noise” associated with the ECS parameters. To account for
this the ECS parameters will be time varying values.

2.4 IDM MPS Model
As in a real IRSP, the IDM MPS acts primarily as a service unit for alignment. The
MPS parameters will be used to establish the relative spatial location of the IRES,
POS, and NUCS/SUT. The MPS set-points are considered to be temporally
stationary (constant). However, due to vibrations, there will be some drift and/or
“noise” associated with the MPS parameters. To account for this the MPS parameters
will also be time varying values.
2.5 IDM IRES Model

2.5.1 IRES Bus-Bar Robbing Effect
Bus-Bar Robbing is an effect common in the micro-resistor array technology.
Basically, as the high current drive voltage bus is tapped into, by each FET along the
bus, a voltage drop occurs dependent on how much current is drawn. This effect is a
scene dependent effect and may require knowledge of the entire image before
adequate compensation can be implemented. Although the Bus-Bar Robbing
operation is not fully modeled yet, the IDM is configured to accommodate this effect
by processing on the output of the CES (see Equation 1 above) as follows:

PostBusBar�i , j � � BusBarRob�AIE �

��

(2)

The empty brackets [ ] in this relationship indicate that the operator BusBarRob{ }
may need the complete AIE array (or some yet to be determined sub-array) to process
the output for a given [i, j] resistor. For a given [i, j] resistor, the output of this
operation is the discretely represented by array PostBusBar[i, j].
2.5.2 IRES Substrate Heating Effect
IRES Substrate Heating is an effect which causes the local substrate to heat up when a
large area of the array is driven at once. This is primarily due to the limitation of the
heat sink to remove local heat. The local heat of a driven region will dissipate
laterally across the heat sink to substrate boundary. This effect is a scene dependent
effect. Although the IRES Substrate Heating operation is not fully modeled yet, the
IDM is configured to accommodate this effect by processing on the output of the CES
after the Bus-Bar Robbing effect as follows:

PreNU �i , j � � SubHeat�PostBusBar�

��

(3)

The empty brackets [ ] in this relationship indicate that the operator SubHeat{ }
may need the complete PostBusBar array (or some yet to be determined sub-array) to
process the output for a given [i, j] resistor. For a given [i, j] resistor, the output of
this operation is the discretely represented by array PreNU[i, j].

544

M.A. Manzardo et al.

NOTE: It may be alternatively sufficient to add an additional system blur to
account for this effect. Adding addition blur effects are discussed later.
2.5.3 IRES Non-uniformity Effect
The primary issue surrounding the utilization of an IRSP is the inherent output NonUniformity (NU) that exists between the resistors when driven to the same input.
This NU is a complex unknown input/output relationship, which differs for each
resistor. For IDM implementation purposes, each resistor is assigned a set of NU
coefficients of a yet to be determined functional form. The modeled output after NU
is represented by:

PostNU �i, j � � ArrayNU �PreNU �i, j �, NUCoefs�i, j,1... N ��

(4)

The functional form used will be determined by empirical measurements. For a
given [i, j] resistor, the output of this operation, ArrayNU{ }, is the discretely
represented array PostNU[i, j].
2.5.4 IRES Fill Factor Effect
Each resistor does not emit energy as a point source. The energy comes from the
distributed area of the resistive material. To represent this effect, PostNU[i, j] is
represented as a two dimensional sum of dirac delta functions that is convolved with
the analytically continuous FillFactor function. NOTE: The exact form of the
FillFactor function will differ between different array designs. Up until now, the
IRSP image representation has been in a unitless discretely sampled coordinate
system. It is advantageous at this point to represent the energy coming off the array in
the angular coordinate system in collimated space after the POS. The description of
signal after incorporating the Fill Factor effect becomes:
� N i �1 N j �1
�

j � �j Array

(5)

It is important to note that at this point the IRSP signal is represented as an
analytically continuous function. There is no theoretical limit to the spatial resolution
used to represent this as a discretely sampled image for viewing purposes. However,
any attempt to represent this discretely is subject to sampling and aliasing artifacts.
To mitigate or limit such artifacts appropriate reconstruction filtering techniques
should be used. As it will be shown later, these artifacts are not issues for the IDM’s
intended use.

2.6 IDM POS Model

2.6.1 POS Transmission and Geometric Aberrations Effects
The POS will impose transmission, geometric aberrations, distortion, and diffraction
effects. The diffraction effect is not implemented because diffraction will occur as a
function of the POS and SUT optics combined. Since, an ideal POS will overfill or
match the entrance pupil of an SUT, diffraction will occur at the SUT and is
accounted for there. Similarly, the distortion effect is cumulative between the POS
and SUT and is accounted for later at the system level. The POS may have a
transmission that varies as a function of field of view. It is accounted for here as a
multiplicative two dimensional function � POS � � . The geometric aberrations effect is
accounted for by convolution with another two dimensional analytical
function GPSFPOS � � . The description of the IRSP signal coming out of the POS
becomes:

2.7 IDM SUT Model

2.7.1 SUT Optics Transmission, Geometric Aberrations, and Diffraction Effects
Similar to the POS, the SUT optics will have transmission, geometric aberration,
distortion, and diffraction effects. As discussed earlier distortion effects will be
handled later at the system level. Similar to the POS, transmission is accounted for
here as a multiplicative two dimensional function � SUT � � . The combined SUT
geometric aberrations and diffraction effects are accounted for here by convolution
with another two dimensional analytical function PSFSUT � � . The description of the
IRSP signal after SUT optics becomes:

NOTE: ��POS2SUT and ��POS2SUT represent some potential registration shift between
the Projection Optics and the SUT Optics. Assuming the SUT output image is
centered on the SUT Optics, this will be the same equivalent shift of the detectors
described later.
2.7.2 SUT Detector Active Area Effect
Similar to the resistor array fill factor effect, the detector does not detect at a point,
but rather over some active area. The efficiency of this active area may not be
continuous. It is therefore, represented here as a general two dimensional convolution
function. The description of the IRSP signal just after detection becomes:

NOTE: Additional System Blur effects can easily be added to the System function
as necessary via additional two dimensional convolution functions.
2.7.3 SUT Discrete Sampling Effect
Representing the image as discretely sampled by the SUT at the [k, l] detector is
accommodated by multiplication with an appropriately shifted dirac delta function.
The description of the signal as discretely sampled by the SUT becomes:
�

(11)
��
��
��
��

At this point the signal is once again represented as a discretely sampled image that
can be readily calculated and viewed. However, it is advantageous to first account for
full system distortion effects. In addition the above form requires a double
summation extending over the entire resistor array for each [k,l] detector. A
simplification to this form is presented below as well.
2.7.4 SUT Noise Effect
The SUT will add noise to the output signal. In the IDM implementation this
operation, SUTNoise{ }, remains to be developed. However, as a place holder the
IDM will process the image as follows:

PostSUTNoise�k , l � � SUTNoise�PostSUTSamp�

��

(12)

2.7.5 SUT Digitization Effect
Most SUTs of interest will also digitize the image in some form or fashion, even if
this means external digitization of an RS170 image. In the IDM implementation this
operation, SUTDig{ }, remains to be developed. However, as a place holder the IDM
will process the image as follows:

Output �k , l � � SUTDig�PostSUTNoise�

��

(13)

2.7 Full System Distortion Effect
The above representation is for an IRSP without any distortion, which is impractical.
To incorporate overall system distortion effects, the nominal sampling location for the
[k,l] detector of (�=�n[k], �=�n[l]) can be replaced by the actual distortion effected
sampling location of (�=�d[k,l], �=�d[k,l]). The following gives an example of how
to incorporate overall IRSP distortion effect:
� d �k , l � � C 0 � C1� n �k � � C 2 � n �l � � C 3 rn �k , l � � C 4� n2 �k � � C 5 � n2 �l � �

The C and D coefficients can be measured or modeled. With the incorporation of
the distortion effect, the signal as discretely sampled by the SUT is:

2.8 Restriction of Summation Limits
The primary bottleneck in calculating the PostSUTSamp image above is the double
summation extending over the entire resistor array for each [k, l] detector. However,
for a given [k, l] detector there is only a need to sum up a limited number of i’s
(resistor array rows) and j’s (resistor array columns) based on the fact that the rolledup System function will be effectively zero outside the range (�min<�<�max,
�min<�<�max).

In the above form, the output as discretely sampled by the SUT can be calculated

3 Conclusion and Closing Remarks
In it’s current state, the IDM incorporates the IRSP effects that tend to redistribute the
image energy as detected by the SUT. These types of effects are: resistor fill factor,
optical distortion, optical geometric aberrations, SUT diffraction, and SUT geometric
aberrations. Over the next couple of years the IDM will grow to encompass the rest
of the IRSP effects.
Using the equations described above requires detailed knowledge of the IRSP
configuration and components. Example results of using the IDM based on a real
IRSP can be found in the simultaneously published paper: “Infrared Scene Projector
Digital Model Development”. Unfortunately, publication limitations have precluded
the derivations of the scale factors, limits, and other parameters used in the IDM.
Interested parties are encouraged to contact the primary author for additional
