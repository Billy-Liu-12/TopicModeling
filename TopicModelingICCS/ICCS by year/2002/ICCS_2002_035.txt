Abstract.

In Berlyand, Kolpakov (2001) we have shown asymptotic equivalence of the effective
constant A for the discrete and continuum models in the limit when the relative interparticle
distance goes to zero.
We use the discrete network to compute A numerically. For this purpose we employ a
computer program which generates a random distribution of disks on the plane. Using this
distribution we obtain the corresponding discrete network. Furthermore the computer
program provides the distribution of fluxes in the network which is based on the Keller’s
formula for two closely spaced disks. We compute the dependence of A on the volume
fraction of the inclusions V for monodispersed composites and obtained results which are
consistent with the percolation theory predictions. For polydispersed composites (random
inclusions of two different sizes) the dependence A is not simple and is determined by the
relative volume fraction Vr of large and small particles. We found some special values of Vr
for which the effective coefficient is significantly decreased. The computer program, which
is based on our network model, is very efficient and it allows us to collect the statistical
data for a large number of random configurations.
We consider a problem of determining effective properties of a two-phase composite
material in which a large number of small particles is randomly distributed in a
homogeneous medium (a matrix or a host with dispersed filler). We consider the case when
properties of the matrix and the filler are vastly different. This question arises in a variety of
engineering problems.
All the problems have two main features: random microstructure and high contrast in
physical properties. Rigorous mathematical results on homogenization of random
microstrusture were obtained in classical works by Kozlov (1980) and Papanicolaou,
Varadhan (1979). In these works the existence of the homogenized limit under very generic
assumption on the microstructure has been rigorously proved. Rigorously justified explicit
computational formulas are available only for a few special structures (Keller (1963),
Dykne (1971)). Some heuristic computational formulas and mixing rules, which are based
on physical considerations (see for example, Brown (1956) where a number of such
formulas for the effective dielectric constant are presented), are in reasonably good
agreement with experimental data only in a certain range of parameters and this range is
typically either not known or quite restrictive (e.g. small concentration).
A variety of rigorously justified bounds on the effective properties of composites have been
obtained over recent. For high contrast composites the bounds from Bruno (1991) work
well below the percolation threshold.
It is also possible to calculate effective properties of random high contrast composites
using numerical methods by solving directly the PDEs with rapidly oscillating coefficients
(e.g. finite elements or integral equations, see for example, Babushka et al). Then two
questions arise. The first is how large is the dimension of the problem (since the problem is
highly inhomogeneous, the corresponding grid has to have a large number of grid points).
The second is how to take into account the high contrast of the composite phases. In
particular, it is necessary to address the issue of concentrated fluxes between closely spaced

inclusions, which requires the use of a very fine mesh in the domains of concentration. It
leads to further increase of the complexity of the problem. Finally, it is necessary to repeat
this computation and average over a large number of random configurations (i.e. to collect
statistics). All these make the problem very difficult.
We propose a different approach that approximates the continuum problem with a
discrete network connecting neighboring particles. The notions of a neighbor and a
neighborhood of a particle play essential role in our consideration. We introduce these
notions using Voronoi tessellation which leads to a natural definition of the neighboring
particles (disks) and the ‘‘boundary’’ disks that is disks which lie near the external
boundary. We observe that while for periodic structures the volume fraction of the particles
uniquely determines the distances between the particles, this is no longer true for irregular
structures and one should search for a new interpartilce distance parameter, which describes
the local geometry when the inclusions are close to touching. We introduce the interparticle
distance parameter for highly packed composites using Voronoi tessellation and obtain a
rigorous asymptotic approximation with respect to this parameter.
We also remark that the domains of the flux concentration in some sense determine the
effective properties (this will be shown in our analysis). That is why the computation of the
solution outside these domains, when using the direct numerical approach solution of the
PDEs, does not provide useful information but leads to an essential increase in the
complexity of the problem. This further motivates our interest in developing a relatively
simple (suitable for collecting statistical data in numerical experiments and capturing the
percolation effects) and at the same time rigorously justified model of a random composite.
Note that the high contrast in physical properties is essential in our consideration and in the
case of an arbitrary contrast ratio (not necessarily high) the corresponding analysis becomes
much more cumbersome.
We consider a medium with piecewise constant characteristics, which corresponds to a
two-phase composite. Highly conducting inclusions are replaced by the ideally conducting
inclusions (with infinite conductivity). This approach is in agreement with bounds Bruno
(1991) which imply that if the contrast ratio is greater than several hundreds, then for many
practical purposes it can be taken to be infinite. More precisely if one plots the effective
conductivity versus the contrast ratio using formulas from Bruno (1991), then the curve
becomes almost horizontal after the contrast ratio reaches certain value (2000-3000 for
typical polymer/ceramic composites).
Finally we mention that our approach allows obtaining an analytical error estimate in
which all constants are explicitly defined. This estimate will be presented in the
forthcoming paper (Berlyand, Novikov).

1. Mathematical model of a high contrast two-phase composite.
approximation and numerical results

The network

In this section we present a reduction of the continuum problem to a discrete network problem
(approximation) using physical arguments. In Section II this approximation will be rigorously justified. Our
main focus in this Section will be physical grounds for the network problem for the two-phase, composites
and numerical results, which, in particular, show a very pronounced effect of polydispersity.
The Continuum Problem. General Description
We consider a two-dimensional model of a high contrast composite and assume that all inclusions are
identical disks. We next present three basic assumptions, which were used in formulation of the discrete
model. Note that in Section 1 we do not present rigorous justification of this model and rather use physical
considerations.
1. On distribution of the inclusions. All inclusions are modeled by circular disks Di. The disks are
uniformly distributed and do not overlap. The latter is achieved in the following way: if a randomly thrown
in disk overlaps any other disc, which is already present, it does not count (i.e. it is disregarded).

2. On potentials on inclusions (disks). The value of the potential ϕ on the disk is a constant, ϕ=ti on Di.
The values ti are unknown and have to be determined in the course of solving the problem.
3. On fluxes. We take into account fluxes between the neighboring inclusions (i.e. closely spaced) only.
All other fluxes (between disks, which are not closely spaced) and their influences on the nearest neighbors
are neglected.
We next comment on these assumptions. The first assumption is commonly used in modeling of randomly
distributed particles and is known as a sequential addition procedure. The second assumption corresponds
to the so-called "stiff expansion" in the homogenization problem (Bakhvalov, Panasenko (1989)). The third
assumption corresponds to the results obtained by Keller (1963) for fluxes in the high contrast periodic
composite.
In Berlyand, Kolpakov (2001) this assumption was rigorously justified for quite generic irregular (nonperiodic) geometries.
We now present rigorous mathematical model of a medium with a large number of "ideally conducting"
inclusions (see the second assumption above). It is convenient to use the following variational formulation
of the problem.
Introduce the domain Π=[-L,L]×[-1,1] occupied by the composite. Denote the disks, which model the
1

inclusions by Di, i=1,…,N. N is the total number of the disks. Then Q=Π\

U
L

Di is the matrix (the

perforated domain).
Introduce the functional space corresponding to the second assumption.
Vp={ϕ∈H1(Q) : ϕ(x)=ti on Di, ϕ(x,±1)=±1}

(1)

The condition ϕ(x,±1)=±1 corresponds to applying the potential ±1 to the boundaries y=±1 respectively.
Consider the following problem

(7)

Here and below x=± L means the vertical (left and right) boundaries of the domain Q, y=± 1 means the
horizontal boundaries of the domain Q.
Condition (5) is obtained by integration by parts in the Euler-Lagrange equation, which corresponds to
the functional (2) and by taking into account condition (4). Condition (7) means the absence of the flux
through the vertical boundaries of the domain Π.
Formulas for the effective conductivity. The effective conductivity from the physical point of view is
defined as the total flux through a cross-section of the domain, for example, through the upper boundary
y=±1. We will need the expression for this flux in terms of the value of the energy integral I(ϕ), which is
commonly used in the homogenization theory as a definition of the effective coefficient (Bensoussan et al
(1978)). For the sake of completeness we present here this simple derivation.

We remark here that the conductivity of the matrix is taken to be 1 therefore the flux in the matrix is given
by ∇ϕ.
The discrete problem. We have expressed A in terms of the flux which allows us to use the third
assumption (Sect. 2) in order to calculate the effective coefficient A. According to this assumption, we take
into account only the fluxes in the ‘‘necks’’ (channels) connecting the neighboring disks and neglect all
other fluxes.
We need to know the flux between two disks if the potential on each disk is a constant. A simple
approximate formula for this flux was obtained by Keller (1963) for identical disks. We employ Keller’s
method to derive an approximate formula for the flux between two disks (the i-th and the j-th) of arbitrary
radii Ri and Rj. Following Keller (1963), we approximate the disks by the tangential parabolas

y=-(δ/2+ρix2/2)
and
y=δ/2+ρjx2/2,
where
ρi=1/Ri,ρj=1/Rj

The distance between the parabolas is equal to
H(x)=δ+(ρi+ρj)x2/2

(16)

We assume that the local flux (the gradient of the potential) between the disks is of the form
(17)

(0, (ti-tj)/H(x))

that is we assume that it is proportional to the difference in temperature or potential and inversely
proportional to the distance between the disks.
Then the total (integral) flux between the disks can be calculated as follows:
(18)

6

Jij=(ti-tj)

∫

dx/(δ+(ρi+ρj)x2/2)=

−6

(ti-tj)/((ρi+ρj)/2)1/2δ1/2arctan[((ρi+ρj)/2δ)1/2x]

6

−6

If the sum of the curvatures ρi+ρj is not small, and the distance δ between the disks is small, then the value
of arctan in the right-hand side (18) is approximately π. Taking into account that ρi=1/Ri, ρj=1/Rj we obtain
Jij=(ti-tj)gij, where gij=2πRiRj/(Ri+Rj)/δ1/2

(19)

Note that gij is the specific flux (i.e. per unit difference of potential).
Formula (19) can be derived from the exact solution of the Laplace equation for two disks as Smythe
(1950).
We now estimate the characteristic values of the flux for the different characteristic distances the
leading term in asymptotics in δ. This exact solution (capacity of two cylinders) can be found in between
the disks. Introduce the following two characteristic distances between a given inclusion and all other
inclusions:
1. Distance between the nearest neighbor’s (closely spaced) inclusions. Denote it by δ* (order of
magnitude). Then δ*<<R for very close packing.
2. The distance between a given inclusion and inclusions which are not close to it (non-neighboring). These
inclusions form so to speak ‘‘second belt’’ and the corresponding distances are greater than δ*. For the
sake of definiteness we choose this second order distance to be of order R.
We comment here on the choice of the cut-off distance δ* in numerical simulations. We used visual
control that is many randomly generated pictures were examined. We considered neighbors the disks,
which share common edge in the Voronoi tessellation. The neighbors in a random array of the disks are not
necessarily closely spaced. The heuristic idea behind our approach is that we take into account the fluxes
between the closely spaced inclusions only. To make the latter more precise we choose the cut-off distance
δ* in the interval 0.3R-0.5R and obtain a connected graph (network), which consists of the center of closely
spaced disks. The graph is a discrete object. It is controlled by the continuous real variable δ* and it
changes by ‘‘jumps’’ as δ* changes. The choice of the interval 0.3R-0.5R is motivated by the fact that
numerical simulations show that even if the disks are not quite of identical sizes, but the variability in the
sizes is not large (factor 2 or 3), then we obtain stable, consistent pictures, that is all closely spaced
neighbors are connected and the disks which are not closely spaced neighbors are not connected. We have
also used another numerical criterion to support this choice of the cut-off distance δ*. Namely, if δ* is
increased, then the effective conductivity practically does not change.

The characteristic values of the fluxes corresponding to these distances are given by J(distance=δ*)~
(R/δ*)1/2, J(distance=R)~1. The first value is obtained from (19). The second value can be obtained from
Smythe (1950) and it is also consistent with (19). Then, we get J(distance=δ*)/J(distance=R)~(R/δ*)1/2.
Thus, by assumption 3 (see the beginning of this subsection), we have to neglect the fluxes of order 1
and keep the fluxes of order (R/δ*)1/2, where R is the characteristic radius of the inclusions and δ* is the
characteristic distance between the inclusions.

2. Numerical implementation of the discrete network approximation and fluxes in
the network
We now define the discrete network, which corresponds to the original continuum model and formulate the
discrete problem.
By assumption 1 (on distribution of the inclusions) we create numerically a distribution of disks for a
given radius (radii for polydispersed case) in the rectangle Π=[-L,L]×[-1,1]. The center x of each disk is
generated as a uniformly distributed in Π random variable. If a disk with the center x and radius R overlaps
with any disk which is already present, then it is rejected, otherwise it is accepted and added to the list of
the disks
L={( xi, R), i=1,...,N}
(20)
We stop throwing in the disks when the prescribed volume fraction of the disks
1

V=

L

πR2/(square of Π)

=

is achieved. Here N is the total number of the disks. We remark here that this procedure works well for
relatively small radii of the disks, when the fraction of the boundary disks is not too high.
We compute the distances δij between the i-th and the j-th disks for the obtained distribution of disks.
Then we determine the flux between the neighboring disks and neglect the fluxes between the nonneighboring disks. For this purpose we introduce the following set of numbers:
gij=gij calculated with formula (19) if δ≤δ* , gij=0 if δ>δ*
(21)
The quantity gij defined by (21) describes the flux between the i-th and the j-th disks. Thus we have
defined a discrete network model (graph),
N={ xi, gij; i,j=1,...,N}
(22)
which consists of points or sites xi (centers of the disks) and edges with assigned numbers gij. The discrete
model (22) does not explicitly contain the sizes of the disks and the distances between them, this
information is incorporated via the set gij. Note that if the concentration is small gij, which gives zero value
of the effective conductivity whereas the conductivity of the matrix is 1. This is not a contradiction. It
means that for high contrasts the value 1 becomes negligible.
The fluxes gij are concentrated in the necks between the disks. Any given pair of disks is connected by a
unique neck. For the disks which are close to the boundaries y=±1 this is no longer the case, since a neck
between the boundary and a disk which lies close to this boundary is not well defined. To avoid this
difficulty, we introduce the notion of a ‘‘quasidisk’’
Definition. Consider a disk, which lies near the boundary y=+1, that is if we project this disk on the
boundary y=+1 parallel to the OY-axis, then the projecting rays do not cross any other disk. We call this
projection a ‘‘quasidisk’’.
Same definition works for the boundary y=-1. In other words a quasidisk is an ‘‘image’’ of a disk which
lies close to the boundary and it represents interaction between this disk and the boundary. Note that in our
further consideration we will not distinguish the disks and quasidisks, which is a very convenient way to
incorporate the boundary effects. Also when fluxes are computed one can treat any quasidisk as a disk of
infinite radius (R=∞) (or zero curvature).

We now present the motivation for our choice of the cut-off distance δ*. If one looks at the pictures
obtained as a result of the numerical procedure for placing random disks on the plane it is easy to see that
with respect to each given disk all other disks fall into one of the two categories: closely spaced neighbors
(or simply ‘‘neighbors’’) and remote disks (‘‘aliens’’). More precisely, a typical disk has 5-6 ‘‘neighbors’’,
the distance between the given disk and its neighbors can be small (δij<<R), whereas the distance between
the given disks and the ‘‘aliens’’ can not be small (at least of order of R). The ‘‘neighbors’’, which can be
in a close contact with form given disk form some sort of a belt which separates the given disk from the rest
(‘‘aliens’’). The fluxes between non-neighbors are negligible and the network approximation ignores them.
We introduce the cut-off distance δ*=R based on the analysis of the arrays obtained numerically in the
procedure described above.
In Berlyand, Kolapkov (2001) we justify the network approximation the δ close packing condition and
present mathematical conditions for its validity the (the δ close packing condition).
To close up this model we need to obtain equations, which determine the (constant) values ti of the
potential on the sites xi of the network (22). To this end we note that by assumption 3, only fluxes between
nearest neighbors contribute into the integral (2). The latter contributions are given by (19). Using (21), we
see that a discrete version of the Dirichlet energy integral (2) for our network model has the following form

3. Numerical simulations
We have implemented a numerical method to
1. Generate a configuration ω as a system of random disks.
2. Compute the coefficients gij for this system of disks.
3. Solve the linear system (26),(27).
4. Compute the effective conductivity A(ω) using formula (28) for this configuration.
The control parameters are: the diameter of the disks R and the total volume fraction V of the disks. As a
result of each run of all four codes we compute the value of the effective conductivity denoted by A(ω), for
a given configuration ω.

In order to collect the statistical information, we run the program repeatedly and collect the data
{A(ω),ω∈Ω}. Then we compute
1. The expected value of the effective conductivity A=EA(ω)
2. The mean deviation DA=E|A(ω)-A|.
3. The maximal conductivity over all collected data m=maxω∈ΩA(ω) .
All the above quantities have been computed for given values of the quantities R and V which is why
A,DA,m=A,DA,m(R,V) are functions of R and V.
Numerical results for monodispersed composites (all disks of the same radius). The goal here is to
test our numerical algorithms which are based on the network approximation, to make sure that we can
consistently recover (in a very efficient way) known results, in particular, recover the percolation picture.
The simulations have been carried out in the following way. All disks were of the same radius. The
volume fraction V has been increased with a fixed step δV. For each value of V the effective conductivity
A(ω) have been computed using the above described procedure.
For each fixed V the quantities A, DA and m(ω) have been computed repeatedly for different random
configurations (100-300 configurations for each value of V).
We have used several sets of identical disks, that is three different disks’ sizes (15, 20 and 25) have been
used to control the stability of our numerics.
Indeed, since the problem is scale invariant the choice of the radius should not change the effective
conductivity. This effect was used for checking the numerical process. We have observed no difference in
qualitative and quantitative dependence of A on the volume fraction V when the sizes were changed.
A typical plot of the function A(V) consists of two parts: for V≤0.2; the total flux through the composite
layer is zero. More precisely, it is very small and it is very close to the Ox axis at the plot. For V≥0.35 the
total flux is for sure positive (taking into account the mean deviation). In the range V=0.2-0.35 the total
flux is not positive for sure. Thus the plots of the function A=A(V) reveal dependence which is typical in
the percolation processes. The percolation threshold in all computations can be estimated as V0≈0.24.
Above the threshold the function A(V) behaves as const(V-V0)p with p≥1, which is consistent with
conventional percolation picture which was observed in experiments and explained by the percolation
theory scaling arguments.
We have done plots for several sizes of identical inclusions to make sure that there is no size effect,
which is in principle, can appear as a numerical artifact. Thus we conclude that our numerical analysis
captures basic features of the real physical phenomenon and provides realistic quantitative predictions.
We have used the graph of the maximal value m(ω) as an additional test for our code. Indeed, from the
physical point of view it should behave (qualitatively) in the same way as the graph for the average
conductivity. We observed it.
The polydispersed composite. We call a composite polydispersed, if it is filled with inclusions of
different sizes. In our model it amounts to consideration of disks of different radii. The distribution of the
sizes can be continuous or discrete. We consider the discrete case that we consider the disks of several
fixed sizes. For the sake of simplicity we study the bimodal case. Namely we have analyzed the following
two components mixtures:
MIXTURE 1. The radii of the disks are: R1=25, R2=15; the relative fractions are v1=33%, v2=67%
respectively.
MIXTURE 2. The radii of the disks are: R1=25, R2=15; the relative fractions are: v1=67%, v2=33%
respectively.
MIXTURE 3. The radii of the disks are: R1=35, R2=15; the relative fractions are v1=34%, v2=66%.
MIXTURE 4. The radii of the disks are: R1=35, R2=15; the relative fractions are v1=66%, v2=34%.
The total volume fraction of the disks varies in the interval [0.4; 0.55]. The total volume fraction 0.55 is
practically the maximal volume fraction, which can be achieved in our procedure (see Assumption 1 on
non-overlapping). We used the following two step procedure for generating the polydisprsed (bimodal)
random configurations of the disks.
First we used the algorithm described in Assumption 1 at the beginning of Sect. 1 for the disks of larger
size until we reach the volume fraction V×v1. Next we use the same algorithm for the small disks with the
volume fraction V×v2, where V is the total volume fraction of disks (kept fixed). In the second step we take
into account the large discs generated in the first step that is if a small disk overlaps with any other disk
present (small or large) it is rejected. The cut-off distance for both steps is 0.3R2-0.5R2.

We found that the functions A(V), which correspond to MIXTURES 1-3, are very similar. It means that
in these cases we observe no influence of polydispersity on the effective constant. At the same time the
function A(V) which corresponds to MIXTURE 4 differs from the others. This leads us to assume that the
polydispersity may or may not have an essential influence on the effective conductivity, depending on the
relative volume fractions of the large and the small inclusions. Note that MIXTURE 4 has a large relative
volume fraction.
By the latter observation we decided to study the influence of polydispersity in more detail. For this
purpose we have studied the following mixture: radii of the disks: R1=25, R2=10; the total volume fraction
of the disks V is equal to 0.55.
We vary the relative volume fraction of the inclusions v1 and v2 (v1+v2=1) from 0 to 1. This
computation shows the same values of A for v1=0 and v1=1 (that is no size effect, which agrees with the
theory, since the problem is scale invariant) and it plunges down sharply in the interval [0.5;0.9]. The latter
agrees with the above result for MIXTURE 4.
Thus we observe that for this mixture polydispersity can decrease the effective conductivity by
approximately a factor of 2. This sharp drop occurs when the relative volume fraction v1 of the large
particles is quite high. If we compare the minimum value A(v1=0.9)=484 with the corresponding value in a
monodispersed composite: A(0.9V≈0.5)=680, then we conclude that the small particles practically do not
contribute into the effective conductivity.
Note that the effect of polydispersity have been considered in Thovert et al (1990) for the dilute limit
and in Van Fo Fi (1971) for a non dilute case (but far from close touching and for a periodic structure).
What concerns us here is the random close packing case (almost touching). In Thovert et al (1990)
polydispersity implies a slight increase in the effective conductivity and in Van Fo Fi (1971) a heuristic and
numerical analysis predict that the effect of polydispersity is very small. In the almost touching case we
observe either very small effect or essential drop in the effective conductivity.
We remark here on the comparison of the results in the dilute limit (where in essence only pairwise
interactions are taken into account), the fixed concentration case (which reduces to a cell problem in the
periodic case) and almost touching random packing (our case) suggests that the effect of polydispersity
manifests itself differently for three qualitatively different ranges of the fillers concentration (dilute
irregular, periodic finite concentration and almost touching irregular).
Description of the numerical procedure. In our numerical simulations we have used an integer lattice
Π0=550×400, i.e. we have chosen the rectangle Π0=[0,550]×[0,400] (that is L=550/400 for convenience of
the visual control on the screen). The centers of the disks have been generated in the form
random(n)+random, where random(n) is a pseudo-random number uniformly generated from the set
{0,1,.....n} and random is a pseudo-random number uniformly generated from the interval [0,1]. The disks
near the boundary were retained if their centers were inside Π0. The boundary values 1 and 0 were
prescribed at the upper and lower edges of Π0.
In the numerical procedure we have used the disks of radii 35, 25, 20, 15, 10 (in our coordinates 35/200,
25/200, 20/200, 15/200, 10/200, since [-1,1] corresponds to [0, 400] and there were from 5 to 20 layers of
disks on the top of each other in the vertical direction. The statistical data was collected mainly for the
disks of radii 25,20, 15. The average number of disks in the rectangle Π0 was between 50 and 150.
In the numerical experiments for the monodispersed composites the expected value of A and the
deviation DA was calculated over 320 configurations for several values of the volume fraction V. We
observe that the graphs, which corresponds to different volume fractions are similar both qualitatively and
quantitatively. Also one can see that m(V) and A(V)=EA(V) have the same qualitative behavior. Thus we
conclude that our numerical procedure is stable.

Conclusions
At present, there are two rigorous mathematical network approximations for modeling continuum high
contrast media.
The Borcea-Kozlov-Papanicolaou model (Borcea, Papanicolaou (1998) and references therein) was
developed for the high contrast continuum problems arising in imaging, when the materials properties are
not known and it is convenient to model the high contrast in a simple geometric manner by using the
Kozlov’s function eS (x)/ε. The two key parameters in this model are (k+/k-)1/2 (determine the conductivity of

the edges in the network), where k+ and k- are the principal curvatures in the saddle points of S(x) and the
high contrast parameter ε.
Our model has been developed for the analysis of the two-phase composites, when the materials
properties of each phase are known. The contrast ratio is taken to be infinite, and it does not contain the
saddle points and the curvatures. The key mathematical parameter in our model is the relative interparticle
distance. Similar parameters have been used in physics and mechanics of composites, and they can be
observed and measured in actual experiments.
For periodic (e.g. square) arrays this parameter amounts to the critical concentration in ‘‘almost
touching’’ regime and is uniquely determined by the critical volume fraction (Keller (1963)). We have
shown that this parameter can be introduced for non periodic arrays, when it is not uniquely determined by
the volume fraction. Also, while in the periodic arrays ‘‘almost touching’’ conductivity appears in the
volume fractions, which are close to the maximal, the irregular (random) arrays may have conducting
chains with very small relative interparticle distance even when the volume fraction of the particles is not
very close to the maximal.
Our approach utilizes the ideas developed in (Keller (1963)) and can be used for mathematical
justification of the asymptotic formulas obtained in (Keller (1963)). In a loose sense our work presents a
‘‘randomization’’ of the Keller'
s model.
Finally, we mention that in the present work we implemented numerically the network approximation.
For the monodispersed composites we recovered classical percolation picture and showed that this
approximation is an efficient computational tool. For a polydispersed composite we found a pronounced
effect in the behavior of the effective conductivity. This suggests that the high contrast, densely packed
composites is very attractive for the design of new materials.
