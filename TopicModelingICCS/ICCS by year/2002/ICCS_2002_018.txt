Abstract. Molecular simulation methods such as Monte Carlo simulation and both
equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics are powerful computational
techniques that allow the exact calculation of molecular properties with minimal
approximations. The main approximations are the choice of intermolecular
potential and the number of particles involved in each interaction. Typically, only
pairwise interactions are counted using a simple effective intermolecular potential
such as the Lennard-Jones potential. The use of accurate two-body potentials and
calculations that explicitly include three or more body interactions are rare because
of the large increase in computational cost involved. Here, we report recent
progress in the use of both genuine two-body potentials and calculations involving
three-body interactions. We show that in some cases, the contribution of threebody interactions can be accurately estimated from two-body interactions without
the increase in computational cost involved in explicitly accounting for three-body
interactions. As an example of the benefit of including three-body interactions, the
improvement in the prediction of vapour-liquid equilibria is examined.

Introduction

Molecular simulation [1] is a generic term that encompasses both Monte Carlo (MC) and
molecular dynamics (MD) algorithms. The appeal of molecular simulation is that it provides
a means of predicting the properties of matter by evaluating the underlying intermolecular
interactions. Unlike other computational techniques, the calculations are exact and require
very few simplifying assumptions or approximations. The main assumptions are the choice
of intermolecular potential and how many atoms or molecules are involved in each
interaction. The heart of a molecular simulation is the evaluation of intermolecular energy
(MC simulation) or forces (MD simulation). For example, in the absence of external
influences, the potential energy of N interacting particles can be obtained from:

E pot = ∑∑ u2 (ri , rj ) + ∑∑
i

j >i

i

∑ u (r , r , r ) + ...... ,

j >i k > j >i

where the summations are performed for all distinct particle interactions, u2 is the potential
between pairs of particles, u3 is the potential between particle triplets etc. An analogous
expression can be written in terms of force, which is simply the derivative of the potential
with respect to intermolecular separation.
The point of truncation of Eq. (1) determines the overall order of the algorithm.
Including pair, three-body or four-body interactions result in algorithms of ON2, ON3 and
ON4, respectively. It should be noted that computation saving strategies [2] have been
developed that mean that these theoretical limits are rarely approached in practice.
Nonetheless, the large increase in computing time involved when three or more body
interactions are involved has meant that, until recently, it has only been computationally
feasible to calculate pair interactions. In a molecular simulation Eq. (1) is typically
truncated after the first term and the two-body potential is replaced by an effective potential:

E pot = ∑∑ ueff (ri , rj ) .
i

(2)

j >i

Therefore, only pairwise interactions are calculated and the effects of three or more body
interactions are crudely incorporated in the effective intermolecular potential.
Many intermolecular potentials have been proposed [1,3], but molecular simulations are
overwhelming performed using the Lennard-Jones potential:

where εij is the potential minimum and σij is the characteristic diameter between particles i
and j. The use of the Lennard-Jones potential is not confined only to atoms. It is also widely
used to calculate the site-site interactions of molecules and it is the non-bonded contribution
of molecular force fields such as AMBER [4] and CHARMM [5].
The use of effective intermolecular potentials and confining the calculations to pairwise
interactions makes molecular simulation computationally feasible for a diverse range of
molecules. Effective intermolecular potentials generally yield good results. However, the
use of effective intermolecular potentials also means that the effects of three-body
interactions remain hidden. It has recently become computationally feasible to perform
molecular simulations involving three-body interactions.
Here, we examine the
consequences of these calculations and show how the contribution of three-body interactions
can be obtained from two-body intermolecular potentials.

Simulation Details

2.1 Simulation Algorithms
The simulations discussed in this work are the result of implementing two different
algorithms. Simulations of vapour-liquid coexistence equilibria were obtained using the
Gibbs Ensemble algorithm [6] as detailed elsewhere [7]. Nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD) calculations used the SLLOD algorithm [8] as discussed recently [9].

3

The simulations typically involved 500 particles and conventional periodic boundary
conditions and long-range corrections were applied. It should be noted that simulations
involving three-body interactions require additional care to maintain the spatial invariance of
three particles with respect to periodic boundary conditions [10].

2.2 Intermolecular Potentials
A feature of the simulations discussed here is that Eq. (1) is truncated after the three-body
term. Therefore, expressions for both u2 and u3 are required. Several accurate two-body
potentials for noble gases are available in the literature [1]. In addition, some recent work
has also been reported on ab initio potentials [11,12]. However, the focus of our
examination is the Barker-Fisher-Watts (BFW) potential [13] which has the following
functional form:
2
C2 j + 6 
 5
.
u2 = ε  ∑ Ai ( x − 1)i exp [α (1 − x) ] − ∑
2 j +6 
j =0 δ + x
 i =0


(4)

In eq. (4), x = r/rm and the other parameters are obtained by fitting the potential to
experimental data for molecular beam scattering, second virial coefficients, and long-range
interaction coefficients. The contribution from repulsion has an exponential-dependence on
intermolecular separation and the contribution to dispersion of the C6, C8 and C10
coefficients are included.
The main contribution to three-body dispersion can be obtained from the triple-dipole
term determined by Axilrod and Teller [14]:

u3 =

v (1 + 3cos θ i cos θ j cos θ k )

(r r r )

3

,

(5)

ij ik jk

where v is the non-additive coefficient, and the angles and intermolecular separations refer to
a triangular configuration of atoms.

Results and Discussion

At the outset it should be noted that calculations of the effect of three-body interactions have
been performed in the past. For example Barker et al. [13] estimated the three-body energy
of argon, Monson et al. [15] investigated three-body interactions in diatomic molecules,
Rittger [16] analyzed thermodynamic data for the contribution of three-body interaction and
Sadus and Prausnitz [17] estimated the three-body contribution to energy on the vapourliquid coexistence curve. Typically, in these early reports the contributions of three-body
interactions were periodically estimated during the course of an otherwise conventional
pairwise simulation. However, recently [9-12] three-body interactions have actually been
used to determine the outcome of the simulation by contributing to the acceptance criterion

4

for each and every step of a Markov chain in a MC simulation or contributing to every force
evaluation in a MD simulation.
The atomic noble gases have provided the focus of most of the work on three-body
interactions because they are free from the additional complexities of molecular shape and
polar interactions. The contributions to three-body dispersion for atomic systems are
documented [18,19]. In addition to the triple-dipole term (Eq. (5)) contributions can be
envisaged from dipole-dipole-quadrupole (DDQ), dipole-quadrupole-quadrupole (DQQ),
triple-quadrupole (QQQ), dipole-dipole-octapole (DDQ) and fourth-order triple-dipole
(DDD4) interactions.
The phase behaviour of fluids is likely to be very susceptible to the nature of
intermolecular interactions. Simulations [1] with the Lennard-Jones potential indicate good
agreement for the vapour-liquid phase envelope except at high temperatures resulting in an
overestimate of the critical point. In Fig. 1, a comparison is made between experiment and
simulations of the vapour-liquid phase envelope of argon in the reduced temperature (T* =
kT/ε, k is Boltzmann’s constant) – reduced density (ρ* = ρσ3) projection. It is apparent from
Fig. 1 that the BFW potential alone cannot be used for accurate predictions. However, when
the BFW potential is used in conjunction with contributions from three-body terms (DDD +
DDQ + DDQQ + QQQ + DDD4), very good agreement with experiment is obtained. In
particular, the improved agreement for the liquid phase densities can be unambiguously
attributed to the importance of three-body interactions. A Similar conclusion can be made
for the other noble gases [10].

of argon [10]

Anta et al. [20] also reported good agreement with experiment for the Aziz-Slaman [21]
two-body potential in combination with only the Axilrod-Teller term (see Fig. 1). The signs
of the various contributions to three-body interactions are different and it was believed [22]
that a large degree of cancellation occurs. Figure 2, illustrates the contribution to energy of
the various contributions at different densities along the liquid side of the coexistence curve
of argon [10].

Gibbs ensemble simulations [10]

The third order multipole interactions (DDQ + DQQ + QQQ) contribute approximately 32%
of the triple-dipole term. However, it is apparent from Fig. 2 that there is an approximately
equal contribution (26 % of DDD) from DDD4 interactions of opposite sign. Therefore the
Axilrod-Teller term alone is a very good approximation of three-body dispersion
interactions.
The above analysis does not address the effect of intermolecular repulsion. Theoretical
models of three-body repulsion are less well developed than our understanding of three-body
dispersion. There is evidence [22] that suggests that three-body repulsion may offset the
contribution of Axilrod-Teller interaction by as much as 45%. However, this conclusion is
based on approximate models [23]. Very recently [24], ab initio calculations for noble gases
have been reported which explicitly account for three-body repulsion. It was observed that
the effect of repulsion is also offset by other influences, leaving the Axilrod-Teller term
alone as a very good approximation of the overall three-body interaction.

6

Irrespective of the fact that the Axilrod-Teller term alone is a very good approximation
of three-body simulations, using it for routine simulations is computationally prohibitive.
For example on a vector computer such as the NEC SX-5, the two-body calculations of the
phase coexistence typically require 1 CPU hour per point to obtain meaningful results. In
contrast, the same calculations involving three-body interactions require 12 CPU hours.
Furthermore, to achieve the figure of 12 CPU hours, the code must be optimized to take
advantage of the vector architecture as detailed elsewhere [25]. These impediments are
magnified further if we attempt to incorporate three-body interactions for molecular systems.
Another consequence of this computational impediment is that genuine two-body potentials
have little role in molecular simulation because they alone cannot be used to accurately
predict fluid properties. To make use of two-body potentials, a computationally expedient
means of obtaining the three-body contribution is required.

through the points was obtained from Eq. (6) [26]

Responding to this need, Marcelli and Sadus [26] analyzed molecular simulation data
and obtained the following simple relationship between the two-body (E2) and three-body
(E3) configurational energies of a fluid:

E3 = −

2νρ E2

where ν is the non-additive coefficient, ε is the characteristic depth of the pair-potential, σ is
the characteristic molecular diameter used in the pair-potential and ρ = N/V is the number
density obtained by dividing the number of molecules (N) by the volume (V). As illustrated
in Fig. 3, this simple relationship predicts the three-body energy with an average absolute
deviation of 2%.
A useful consequence of Eq. (6) is that it can be used to derive an effective potential
from any two-body potential via the relationship:

2νρ 

ueff = u2 1 −

(7)

The results of Gibbs ensemble simulations [26] for the vapour-liquid equilibria of argon
using Eq. (7) in conjunction with the BFW potential are compared with experiment in Fig. 4.
It is apparent from Fig. 4 that Eq. (7) yields very good agreement. This is significant
because it means that two-body intermolecular potentials can be usefully used in molecular
simulations. Equation (7) only involves the evaluation of pairwise interactions, so the
computational impediment of three-body calculations is removed.

8

Although Eq. (7) was determined from Monte Carlo Gibbs ensemble simulation, it can
also be used in MD. The forces required in MD are simply obtained from the first derivative
of Eq. (7) with respect to intermolecular pair separation. Recently [27] it has been
established that Eq. (7) can be used in NEMD [8,9] simulations of transport phenomena such
as shear viscosity. As illustrated in Fig. 5, it was shown [27] that the ratio of two-body and

three-body energies is largely independent of the reduced strain rate ( γ * = γ σ m / ε , m is
the mass).

Furthermore, Eq. (6) can be used to predict the three-body energy obtained from NEMD
simulations to average absolute deviation of 2.3%. This suggests that Eq. (7) can be used in
an NEMD simulation to predict shear viscosities with a similar degree of accuracy as full
two-body + three-body simulations. Some results [27] for the reduced shear viscosity
( η* = ησ 2 / mε ) are illustrated in Fig. 6, which confirm the usefulness of Eq. (7).

Conclusions

The results obtained from traditional effective intermolecular potentials can, in some cases,
be misleading because the influence of three or more body interactions is not explicitly taken
into account. Improved agreement between theory and experiment might be obtained by
using two body potentials in conjunction with three-body interactions. The available
evidence suggests that the Axilrod-Teller term alone is a good description of three-body
interactions. There is also evidence that there is a simple relationship between two-body and
three-body interaction energies, which can be used to formulate an effective potential from
two-body potentials. This means that genuine two-body potentials can be used to accurately
predict the properties of fluids.
