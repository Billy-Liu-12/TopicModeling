Abstract. The aim of this paper is to show the relationship between inconsistent
and contradictory matrices of data obtained as a result of the pairwise
comparison of factors in the sense of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The
consistency check is performed to ensure that judgements are neither random
nor illogical. This paper shows that even if a matrix will pass a consistency test
successfully, it can be contradictory. Moreover an algorithm of checking
contradictions is proposed.

Introduction

The main aim of the pairwise comparison method in the AHP is to make a ranking of
n given factors or alternatives. To compare the factors often a scale
{1 / 9,1 / 8, K ,1 / 2,1,2, K ,8,9} introduced by Saaty [6] is used. The numbers from the
scale above are displayed in the matrix of judgement R = rij nxn expressing a relative

[ ]

significance of the factors Fi and F j .
Matrix R is said to be reciprocal if rij = 1 / r ji for all i, j = 1,2, K , n and rij > 0 .
The matrix R is said to be consistent if rij r jk = rik for all i, j , k = 1,2, K , n .
There are some reasons of having inconsistent data, namely the mistakes of a person
providing his or her opinions or using 9-point semantic scale [5]. To show this
phenomenon assume the following exemplary judgement matrix:
 1 3 5
R = 1 / 3 1 − .
1 / 5 − 1 

To keep the consistency the numbers R (2,3) = 5 / 3 and R (3,2) = 3 / 5 should be
placed in the empty entries respectively. These numbers however do not belong to
assumed scale! To avoid such a situation, one can use a scale containing only the
multiple of one number e.g. 2 . A scale constructed in this way would take a form:
{K1 / 8,1 / 4,1 / 2,1,2,4,8K}. A quantity of numbers appearing on the scale would
depend on complexity of the problem. A lot of authors discuss the problems of scale
e.g. Finan and Hurley [3]. A reasonable requirement is to make inconsistencies as few
as possible. The most often approach is to calculate a consistency index according to
the formula [6,7]:
C.I . =

λ max − n
n −1

(1)

where λ max denotes the maximal eigenvalue of matrix R . When matrix R is
consistent then λ max = n and C.I . = 0 .
It’s obvious that C.I . should be as close as possible to zero, but till now it is not said
precisely what values are permissible. The standard procedure allows to accept a set
of judgements when C.I . is not bigger than 1 / 10 of the mean consistency index of
randomly generated matrices. The mean consistency for indices matrices of size 3x3
to 9x9, proposed by Saaty and Vargas [7] are shown in Table 1.

Karpetrovic and Rosenbloom [4] give some examples when the comparisons are
neither random nor illogical but they fail the consistency test.
This paper separates a subset of so-called contradictory matrices from inconsistent
matrices and shows that such matrices may pass the consistency test and data may be
acceptable. At the end an algorithm for checking contradictions is presented and some
numerical examples are included.

Basic Concepts

Let us introduce the following definition of contradictory judgement matrix, based on
the transitivity rule.

Definition 1
The matrix R is called contradictory if there exists i, j , k : 1,2, K , n such that any of
the detailed below cases hold:
rij > 1 ∧ rik < 1 ∧ r jk > 1

(2)

rij < 1 ∧ rik > 1 ∧ r jk < 1

(3)

rij = 1 ∧ rik > 1 ∧ r jk < 1

(4)

rij = 1 ∧ rik < 1 ∧ r jk > 1

(5)

rij = 1 ∧ rik = 1 ∧ r jk < 1

(6)

rij = 1 ∧ rik = 1 ∧ r jk > 1 .

(7)

Denoting: >> - "better", << -"worst", = - "equal", it is equivalent to contradictory
judgements concerning factors Fi , F j , Fk :
Fi >> F j and Fi << Fk and Fk << F j

(8)

Fi << F j and Fi >> Fk and Fk << F j

(9)

Fi = F j and Fi >> Fk and Fk << F j

(10)

Fi = F j and Fi << Fk and Fk >> F j

(11)

Fi = F j and Fi = Fk and Fk << F j

(12)

Fi = F j and Fi = Fk and Fk >> F j .

(13)

It’s easy to notice that in this case a transitivity rule does not hold.
An example of a matrix with acceptable C.I . , but which is contradictory is:

The consistency index for this matrix is equal to C.I . = 0.07252 . Moreover, note that
when the entries R (2,3) and R (3,2) are replaced, the fully consistent matrix in the
sense of the consistency index C.I . (1) is obtained. Analysing this matrix one may
notice that R (1,2) = 2, R (1,3) = 1 / 2 . So, one may say that factor F2 is better then

F1 , factor F1 is better then F3 and it would be natural to expect that F2 were better
than F3 , but R (2,3) = 4 , what means that F3 is better than F2 .
Studying this example another remark may be made. Intuitively one could expect that
contradictory is the extreme form of inconsistency, but it is not true. This example
shows that a matrix may be very close to perfect consistency, but it’s possible to find
some contradicts in the judgements. Graphically the structure of comparison matrices
may be presented as shown in Fig.1.

The last task undertook by authors is to create an effective algorithm testing the
contradictory. The proposal may be formulated in the following way:
FOR ( i, j , k = 1 AND i ≠ j ≠ k ) TO n DO
IF log rij ⋅ log rik ≤ 0 AND log rik ⋅ log r jk < 0
THEN STOP - CONTRADICTORY
ELSE
IF log rij = 0 AND log rik = 0 AND log r jk ≠ 0
THEN STOP - CONTRADICTORY
ELSE
OK.

Conclusions

In this paper a new approach to consistency, inconsistency and contradictory of
judgement matrices obtained as a result of the pairwise comparisons in the AHP was
introduced. The method can be easily applied for the case with many experts - it is
logical to check their judgements independently and to exclude these from them, who
provided contradictory opinions.
The approach presented can be extended for fuzzy approaches to the problem
considered, [1,2], i.e. for the fuzzy case , contradictory in the opinion of authors,
should be checked at least for the modal values.
It is necessary to stress that the consistency test is not sufficient for statement of a fact
if a set of judgements should be accepted or rejected. Therefore an additional
contradictory test should be made.
