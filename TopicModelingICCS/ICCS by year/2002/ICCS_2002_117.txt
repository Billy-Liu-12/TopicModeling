Abstract
It is difficult to classify web documents with exact user intention because existing
document classification systems are based on word frequency number using single
keyword. To solve this problem, first, we use a keyword, a query, domain knowledge.
Like explanation-based learning, first, query is analyzed with knowledge-based
information and then structured user intention information is extracted. We use this
intention tree in the course of reclassifying the documents already categorized using
word frequency as user information and constraints. Thus, we can classify web
documents with more exact user intention. In classifying documents, structured user
intention information is helpful to keep more documents and information which can be
lost in the system using single keyword information. Our hybrid approach integrating
user intention information with existing statistics and probability method is more
efficient to decide direction and range of document category than existing word
frequency approach.
1 Introduction
Clustering means manufacturing data as it maintains information. It is important to
check necessary information(Jayanarayan 1990, Bruce Croft 1977). Clustering course
includes the division of data into various model data. Various model data have common
features
that
represents
congregation.
The latest typical data groups and reference systems use cobweb system and personal
webwatcher to monitor user behavior and wise wire system to search the information
for user using profile from the analysis of the existing search profile. Cobweb
developed to remodeling gradually concept course for person. It consists level structure
, a classified subject for conceptual clustering algorithm and classify downward.
Gradual progress studying method has feature for unsupervised studying method
performance(Fisher & Langley 1986, Fisher 1996). But cobweb classifies document
according to statistics and probability by using word frequency, so user interest and
intention couldn’t be properly reflected. Therefore, to solve that problem, this paper
propose D-car(Dynamic category rebuilder) system that could generate intention tree
extension to analyze user query using knowledge base and conceptual thesaurus,
thereby reflecting user’s intention more closely to document classification category
using restraint and supplementary information to cobweb system, a document
classification method using word frequency.

2.1 Cobweb algorithm
Cobweb employs Category Utility or CU as its evaluation function. The category utility
equation can be summarized as (X – Y) / K where X is the expected number of attribute
values that can be correctly guessed, given the K categories, and Y is the expected

number of attribute values that can be correctly guessed without any category
knowledge. Dividing by K, the total number of classes(Gluck & Corter 1985). This
concept can be described as the following equation 1.
[Equation (1)]
{SUM from { {k}=1} to K {P( { C}_{k }) SUM from { {i}=1} to I } SUM from { {
j}=1} to J P( { A}_{i } = { V}_{ij } | { C}_{k })}^{2 } - SUM from { { i}=1} to I
SUM from { { j}=1} to J {P( { A}_{i }= { V}_{ij })}^{2}} over {K } 1
The P( { C}_{k } ) above represents a ratio of classification k relative to the total
while P( {A}_{i } = {V}_{ij } | {C}_{k} ) means probability of certain
attributes given a set of concepts. And I means the number of attributes and J represents
a number of learning objects.
Cobweb features a hierarchical structure of the concepts and top-down classification
approach and it is unsupervised learning method. Also, it carries out incremental
learning and calculates highly predictive value by using hill climbing method for new
learning object.
There are four learning operators used to construct a document classification tree in
Cobweb such as incorporate, create-new-disjunct, merge, split.
Incorporate is an operator that includes newly input document to the current sibling
node while create-new-disjunct is applied when the newly input document is too
disparate to be included in the existing node. Merge is an operator that transforms the
two similar nodes in the current level of sibling nodes into new node. Split is used to
segment the current sibling node if its attribute is too generalized(Fisher, D. 1985).
2.2 Learning documents pre-processing algorithms
Pre-processing of learning documents involves a process of extracting or granting index
words that can represent a certain document. Index words can locate certain information
requested by a user and select the most relevant pieces of information from vast
information sources. There are four major algorithms to extract such index words; first,
an algorithm that eliminates an HTML tag from Snippet documents, the primary results
of web search; second, an algorithm that removes stoplist to reduce the number of index
words and stemming algorithm; third, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) algorithm that extracts keywords based on the frequency of certain words in a
given document; and, fourth, vector length normalization algorithm that resolves the
imbalances in influence caused by the different length of documents that include key
words. These four algorithms were applied in the pre-processing of learning documents
in this research.
3 Analysis on user’s intention

3.1 Intention
The current systems are more disparate than ever in terms of its function, location, time
and increasingly becoming modularized. A widely used method to efficiently manage
such systems and enhance the capability of problem solution is to provide autonomy
and social character that enables mutual cooperation to each module (agent) and
programs. Under this method, a system that utilizes a user’s intention is employed to
predict the behaviors of the system in a prompt and intuitive way.
For example, in the two sentences that say “A student carried an umbrella because he
believed it would rain” and “A student studied hard because he desired to enter the
university”, the behaviors of two students were characterized as “believe” and “desire.”
This is called “intention system”(Wooldridge & Jennings 1994).
This intention concept was also utilized in this thesis. User’s intention was extracted
and reflected in classifying documents(Werner 1990).
3.2 Construction of intention tree
In this section, the concept will be further expanded based on a keyword that expresses
a user’s intention through knowledge base or concept thesaurus. Small-scale knowledge
base was established for this research that covers health and medical areas. Categories
applied for the research is portrayed in <Table1>.

Figure 1. User’s intention tree construction process
Learning example documents are created by applying algorithms to documents collected
from the web. Such algorithms include the pre-processing methods discussed above
such as eliminating HTML tag and stoplist, stemming and TF-IDF.
From these learning example documents, user’s intention is extracted using knowledge
base and major intention and sub-intentions in these documents are abstracted. Based
upon these abstracted intentions, user’s intention tree is formed, which will be reflected

in the process of rebuilding dynamic category in Chapter 4.

(cereals (rice, pea, . . . ));

potato,
carrot, . . ));
(diet consultation);
User’s search intention is consisted of abstract words in the upper level, therefore this
can be again divided into sub-intentions. This explosion process makes it easier to find
the relationship among keywords in the current web documents. For example, when
users search for documents, they can enter the following combination of words:
(illness : prevention), (dish : decoration), (hammer : carpenter)
The first words in the parentheses are the keywords while the second words represents
users’ intention. The first words can again be matched with other intentions like:
(illness : treatment), (dish : cooking), (hammer : carpenter)
As these examples illustrate, the user’s intention can be interpreted in terms of
dimension or context. As the intention explodes into sub- and lower- level intentions, it
can be linked to other words that are within its dimension or its context.
sIi in the Figure 2 represents the generalized concepts of the scope, constraints, order
and so forth like [LB,UB], {{ { C}_{1} BIGCUP { C}_{2} BIGCUP …
BIGCUP{C }_{n } } }. And the sub-intentions are compared with the abstract key

words in section 3.3. sIi and sIn above symbolize concepts that encompass several
sub-intentions.
The explosion process will define the relationship, order and transformation rules
among the intentions.

3.3 Abstraction of learning example document
Through abstraction process, it can be determined how much the current web
documents correspond to which of the sub-intentions of user’s intention. For this
process, the learning example documents created through pre-processing of web
documents were used. The abstraction process of tracking down related intentions goes
through following five stages(here, the groups of learning example documents were
represented as {{ {K}_{1},{K}_{2},…{K}_{n}} }):

major intention decision

1) Construction of intention set related to key words
Search for intentions related to keywords {k} – {i} in the knowledge base as follows:
{ K}_{i } = {{{Inti}_{1},{Inti}_{2}…{Inti}_{n}} }
{ K}_{j } = {{{Intj}_{1},{Intj}_{2}…{Intj}_{n}} } ...
2) Calculation of proportion of Int(i)
Find out keyword group in the current document for the created intentions and
calculate “keyword correspondence ratio ({{R}- {k}})” which is obtained from the
following equation:
{{R}- {k}} = {total number of keywords found in the current documents} over {the
total number of keywords found in the knowledge base} ✕ 100}

4) Intention abstraction
Abstract sub-intentions until the keyword correspondence ratio reaches the level of
threshold. In other words, create generalized intention that covers several keywords
and again compare it with IntTree.
5) Formation of major intention
Intention that coincides with the IntTree and shows the highest {R} – {k} becomes
the Major Intention of the current document.
4 Dynamic category (D – car) rebuilding
4.1 Structure of D-car system
The main concept of how the D-car system works is that the relationship among
documents in the initial user’s intention tree forms a group information and in turn, this
group information serves as constraining factors in determining the category of
classified documents using frequency. In other words, documents in each group will be
classified in a way that can reflect user’s sub- intentions. So, D-car is a system that
rebuild the document classification category utilizing user’s intention tree. The structure
of D-car is illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5. D-car system configuration
As demonstrated in Figure 5, users search web documents by entering keywords into
the usual search engines and the searched web documents go through pre-processing
such as elimination of HTML tag and stoplist, stemming and TF-IDF algorithms. The
result of this process is learning example documents. And the user’s intention is
analyzed from the keywords and the intention is exploded into sub-intentions, which
later being abstracted and, here, the user’s intention tree is generated.
With this user’s intention on one hand, Cobweb algorithm, a classification method using
the word frequency, is applied to learning example documents and, as a result,
document classification category is produced on the other hand. This category is
combined with the aforementioned user’s intention tree and rebuilt as a category that
reflects the user’s intention.
4.2 Document classification using intention tree
As previously explained, the documents collected from the web go through preprocessing and, as a result, learning example documents are generated. And keyword
group is selected and the keyword will be exploded into sub-intentions using knowledge
base. The Figure 6 below represents a group of documents that coincide with the subintentions. Here, {D1, D2, D3, D4, . . . . . . D1O} represents the documents
collected from the web.

The Tree above consists of
(1) selection of documents containing the intentions within the IntTREE from the total
learning objects
(2) documents related to sub-intentions (sIi) exploded from Intmain
Analysis on relationship among documents (intention group is a standard)
In the Tree above, intention groups such as sIw,sIx,sIy,sIz can be found (the
standards in forming groups can be changed). From each group, the features of
documents can be extracted.
ex) Intention group 1) depth of three nodes
Selected

group

{{D8},{D2,D9},{D4},
{D7}, {D6, D5}}

2) width of three nodes

(no related document to sIy)

Such features within the group lead to a document classification reflecting user’s
intention and comprehensive representation of the relationship among keywords in the
knowledge base without taking the frequency of keywords into consideration.
By increasing or decreasing the size of the group, the changes in the performance of
intention tree can be observed.
The standards 1) and 2) in the example above will be used as criteria for rebuilding the

document classification category based on frequency and statistical method.
4.3 Dynamic category rebuilding
The documents classified by user’s intention tree from the knowledge base form a group
for each intention. Here, the location of document within the group is a feature that
creates the meaning of group intention as well as a basis for the correlation among
documents within the group. The Figure 7 below shows the process of rebuilding
category by combining the user’s intention and the relationship among documents and
keywords with the previous document classification method using keyword frequency.

Figure 7. Category rebuilding process
(1) Group constructor
As shown in Figure 6 in section 4.2, the groups will be formed in accordance with
sub-intentions. The group size should be big to highlight the relationship structure
among documents while the groups size should be small to put an emphasis on the
appearance of keywords in the documents.
(2) Group feature extractor
Following information is used to extract features from the groups.
• Scope of concept that includes the documents in the group (number of concept
node: width of three)
• Depth of group (expression of sub-concept)
Besides these two, several group features can be used to indicate the relationship
among documents.
(3) Category rebuilder
In the category structure based on frequency and probability, relocate the documents
that do not meet the standards created in the stage of Group feature extractor. The
category shown in Figure 8 is rebuilt as category in Figure 9 after applying the
standards of the depth of three nodes and the width of three nodes generated from
the intention tree in Figure 6.

Figure 8. Category based on frequency and probability
The algorithm used in rebuilding category is as follows:
• Modification of depth: Too much specification was the cause of the problem.
- Generalize the document in the node that do not meet the standards
- Abstract the documents to a upper level
• Modification of width: Eliminate unnecessary interpretations which come from
too diverse approach in interpreting the documents.
- Select the lowest node group or a few group documents that falls outside of the
common parent node
- Make a list of group nodes that do not meet the standards within the intention
tree
- Several related group nodes
link them to common parent node
- Single related group node
link it to single element node
When the standards in Figure 6 were applied, category based on frequency and
probability in the Figure 8 breaches the width constraint. So, “c group”, the lowest
group, is selected and “document D8” is relocated to Introot, thereby resulting in
rebuilding of category.

5 Conclusion
This research was designed and conducted to find the documents on the web that
correspond to user’s intention. To achieve this goal, an integrated approach in
classifying documents was tried by combining the conventional method using
probability and statistics with the new method using user’s intention in extracting
document features
Under this approach, knowledge base was utilized to overcome the shortcomings of the
conventional document classification method based on probability and statistics. There
were three major benefits garnered from the approach.
First, information related to intention in the knowledge base was used to track down the
sub-intentions of user’s intention, which was extracted from the keywords. This enabled
more precise and flexible document classification. Second, the structural relationship
among groups of sub-intentions was analyzed and, based on that analysis, the document
classification category using probability and statistics was rebulit to reflect user’s
intention, thereby leading to enhanced document classification capability. Third, this
approach offered a way to get over with some of the problems with Cobweb system.
Cobweb system is based on word frequency and it is subject to the order of document
entry. Therefore, the same documents can be classified into different nodes according to
the order of entry and every document was classified as terminal nodes under one root
node, making it difficult to trace the category of certain document. Also, a single
keyword used in cobweb system was not enough to reflect user’s interests and intention,
but by complementing cobweb system and grouping keywords, the new approach made
it easier to reflect user’s intention.
In the areas of web documents feature extraction and user’s intention reflection,
following further studies are necessary for the expansion of D-car system: research on
methods to express user’s intention in the existing and currently operating knowledge

bases and concept thesaurus; methods to analyze the user’s intention using keyword
structure in groups; methods to infer user’s intention from keywords; and methods to
extract intention information from the accumulated user’s profile. Especially, in the
hierarchically structured intention tree, the research on extracting intention from
different locations and groups should be conducted in association with distributed and
object technology.
