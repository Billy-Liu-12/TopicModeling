Abstract.This paper presents, comparativelly, the Bartels-Stewart simetrical
method and Hammarling method, for the positivelly defined continue
Lyapunov matrix equation.

1. Introduction
The linear matrix equations Sylvester and Lyapunov frequently appear in the field of
analysis and sinthesys of linear control systems as: spectral decomposition of linear
systems, stability analysis [3], state estimation, optimal sinthesys of multi input-multi
output linear systems [5], etc. The necessity of solving such equations led to
obtaining of a great number of algorithms, but not always proposed method are
appropriate for numerical calculus. Only a small number of methods based on matrix
canonical forms [7] (Jordan, Hessenberg, Schur) are used due to the high stability of
the algorithms [8].

2. The Linear Matrix Equation Lyapunov. The Symmetrical
Bartels-Stewart Method
Let the Lyapunov linear matrix equation :
AT X + XA + C = 0

(1)

where A ‚àà M n , n (¬Ü ), and C ‚àà M n , n (¬Ü ) , are symmetrical. The Lyapunov equation has

Œªi + Œª j ‚â† 0 where Œªi , Œª j ‚àà œÉ ( A), ‚àÄ i, j = 1,....., n , œÉ ( A ) being the
spectrum of the matrix A [2]. We suppose that this condition holds.
The most efficiently method of solving is the Bartels-Stewart method (1972) [1].
The solving algorithm is the following:
1) The matrix A is reduced to the real Schur form (FSR) [5] by ortogonal
transformation S = U T AU ;
2) The matrix F = U T CU is calculated;
3) The changed system is solved:
solution

if

S T Y + YS + F = 0

(2)

4) The solution X = UYU T is obtained;
It is seen the matrix C is symmetrical, the matrix F is symmetrical too. So, Y and
X are symmetrical the same . The symmetry is used as follows:
Consider the matrix S, F and Y compatible partitioned on blocks
Ô£´ F11 F21T Ô£∂
Ô£´ Y11 Y21T Ô£∂
Ô£´ S11 S12 Ô£∂
S =Ô£¨
Ô£∑, Y = Ô£¨
Ô£∑
Ô£∑, F = Ô£¨
Ô£≠ 0 S22 Ô£∏
Ô£≠ F21 F22 Ô£∏
Ô£≠ Y21 Y22 Ô£∏

where S11 is the first block of . From the equation (2) obtain:
S11T Y11 + Y11 S11 + F11 = 0
T
S 22
Y21 + Y21 S11 + F21 + S12T Y11 = 0
T
S 22
Y22 + Y22 S 22 + F22 + S12T Y21T + Y21 S12 = 0

(4)
(5)
(6)

The equation (4) is of first or fourth order. If we take into account the Y11 is
symmetrical only three equation are obtained (not four). The equation (5) is a
T
Sylvester equation, if suppose Y11 was obtained before. Also it is seen S 22
is in
inferior FSR. From (6) also it is seen Y21 is known the problem is reduced to solving
of the same form equation, but with small dimension.
Next, the algorithm of solving the Lyapunov equation (1) is presented.
Suppose the matrix S, F and Y are partitioned according the block diagonal structure
of the matrix S in FSR:
Ô£´ F11 F21T ... Fp1T Ô£∂
Ô£´ S11 S12 ... S1 p Ô£∂

where every block Sii is of the first or second order. The solving of the system (2) is
made using the following algorithm:
Algorithm 1. The symmetrical Bartels-Stewart method:
For the given S matrix in FSR form, partitioned as (7) and matrix F symmetrical and
partitioned according with the block diagonal structure of S matrix, if

œÉ ( S ) ‚à© œÉ (‚àí S ) = ‚àÖ , this algorimtm gives the solution Y of Lyapunov equation (2)
partitioned as (7) and overposed F.

The proposed algorithm of symmetrical Bartles method for continue Lyapunov
matrix equation needs 0.5 n3 standard float point operations like ( aij + taik ). The
complete algorithm of solving the equation (1) can use the symmetry to obtain the
decompositions F = U T CU and X = UYU T . So, every product can be evaluated by
1.5 n3 standard float point operations. The obtaining of the real Schur form of A
needs 10 n3 standard float point operations, and the complete algorithm of solving the
equation (1) needs 13.5 n3 standard operations [6].

3. The Positive Defined, Continue Linear Matrix Lyapunov
Equation. The Hammarling Method
Let be the positive defined linear matrix Lyapunov equation:
AT X + XA + C = 0 ,

(9)

where A is a stable matrix( œÉ ( A ) ‚àà C ‚àí ), and the matrix C is positive simidefined.
According Glover theorem (1984) their solution X is positive semidefined. Let be
the Cholesky factorization X = V T V , where the matrix V is superior triangular with
diagonal non negative elements .
The Cholesky factor of X can allways replace X sometimes beeing more useful
then X. If X is not singular, then the conditional number of X and V (for the norm 2)
satisfy the relation œá ( X ) = œá 2 (V ) .
The matrix X can be worst conditioned then V with respect to converselying
operation. If V can be obtained directly and it replaces X, we can avoid the lost in
precision associated to the wrst conditioning of X.
The matrix C, being positive semidefined, can be decomposed: C = F T F , where
F ‚àà M n , n (¬Ü ) .

The solving of Lyapunov equation:
AT (V T V ) + (V T V ) A + F T F = 0 ,

(10)

is made by obtaining the fator V directly, supposing we know the matrix A and F.
Next we will show an algorithm proposed by Hammarling (1982) [4]. It is based
on the reduction AWRWKHUHDOIRUP6FKXUUHDO :
1) The matrix A is reduced to FSR by ortogonal transformation: S = QT AQ ;
2) The QR decomposition of the matrix FQ on the form PR=FQ is calculated, where
P is the orthogonal and R is triangular superior.
3) The Lyapunov equation is solved
S T (U T U ) + (U T U ) S + RT R = 0 ,

(11)

where U is the unknown parameter.
4) Obtain the decomposition QR of the matrix UQT
ZV = UQT ,

(12)

where Z is the orthogonal and V is triangular superior.
Sometimes the step (4) is not necessar, the calculus beeing made with the factor V
in form V = UQT .
Next we will present the algorithm for solving the equation (11). Suppose the
matrix S, R and U are partitionated as:
Ô£´ s sT Ô£∂
Ô£´ r rT Ô£∂
Ô£´ u11 u T Ô£∂
S = Ô£¨ 11 Ô£∑ , R= Ô£¨ 11
Ô£∑ , U= Ô£¨
Ô£∑,
Ô£≠ 0 S1 Ô£∏
Ô£≠ 0 R1 Ô£∏
Ô£≠ 0 U1 Ô£∏

(13)

where s11 is a scalar 2x2 block, and the matrix R and U are compatible partitioned.
By replacing these matrix in (11) obtain:
s11T u11T u11 + u11T u11 s11 + r11T r11 = 0

(14)

S1T u ‚ãÖ u11T + u ‚ãÖ u11 s11 + rr11 + su11T u11 = 0

(15)

S1T U1T U1 + U1T U1 S1 + R1T R1 + rr T + ( S1T u + su11T )u T + u (u T S1 + u11 sT ) = 0

(16)

Supposing u11 is not singular we define:

Œ± = r11u11‚àí1
and the equation (14) will be:
S1T u + u Œ≤ + rŒ± + su11T = 0, unde Œ≤ =u11 s11u11‚àí1

(17)

(17) is a Sylvester matrix equation, and:

Œ≤ T + Œ≤ +Œ±T = 0

(18)

Let be the matrix:
Z = R1T R 1 + rr T + ( S1T u + su11T )u T + u (u T S1 + u11 sT ) .

(19)

If u satisfy (17), then:
S1T u + su11T = ‚àírŒ± ‚àí u Œ≤

(20)

By replacing (20) in (19) and taking into account (18), obtain:
Z = R1T R1 + rr T ‚àí rŒ± u T ‚àí uŒ± T r T ‚àí u ( Œ≤ + Œ≤ T )u T =
= R1T R1 + r (r ‚àí uŒ± T )T ‚àí uŒ± T (r ‚àí uŒ± T )T = R1T R1 + yy T

where y = r ‚àí uŒ± T .
Because R1T R1 is almost positive semidefined, Z will be the same and R1 can be
so that:
Z = R1T R1 + yy T = R%1T R%1 .

(21)

The equation (14) becomes:
S1T U1T U1 + U1T U1 S1 + R%1T R%1 = 0 ,

(22)

being like (11), but with small dimension.
Next we will present an algorithm for solving the equation (11) based on the
equation (14),(17) and (22). Suppose the matrix S, R and U are compatible
partitioned with FSR of S:

It can be proved the algorithm 2 needs 5 n3 /6 standard float point operation, and
the complete algorithm of solving the positive defined Lyapunov equation needs
about 14 n3 standard operations [6].

4. Conclusions
The algorithms above presented have a high numerical stability compared with
clasical algorithms because of using of QR factorization and a real Schur form. The
necessary number of standard float point operations to implement these alghoritms
does not differ too much: 13.5 n3 operations for algorithm 1 and 14 n3 operations for
algorithm 2.
