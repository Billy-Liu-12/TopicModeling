Abstract. This paper proposes a new way to study traffic flow at an urban
unsignalised intersection, through detailed space considerations, using cellular
automata (CA). Heterogeneity and inconsistency are simulated by incorporation
of different categories of driver behaviour and reassignment of categories with
given probabilities at each time step. The method is able to reproduce many
features of urban traffic, for which gap-acceptance models are less appropriate.
Capacities of the minor-stream in a TWSC intersection are found depend on
flow rates of major-streams, also changes with flow rate ratio (FRR= flow rate
of near lane: flow rate of far lane). Hence flow rates corresponding to each
stream must be distinguished. The relationship between the performance of
intersections and other traffic flow parameters is also considered. Vehicle
movements in this paper relate to left-side driving, such as found in UK/Ireland.
However, rules are generally applicable.

Introduction

Two types of unsignalised intersections have been the main focus in modelling
uncontrolled intersection flow. These are the two-way stop-controlled intersection
(TWSC) and all-way stop-controlled intersection (AWSC). AWSC and TWSC are
typical in North America and UK/ Ireland respectively. We focus on the latter here.
Performance measurements for TWSC have included capacity, (the maximum
number of vehicles that can pass through an intersection from a given road), queuelength and delay. Both empirical and analytical methods have been used. The former
include Kimber’s model [1] and the linear capacity model [2], while the most
common analytical method uses the gap-acceptance criterion [3].
Cellular automata (CA) models provide an efficient way to model traffic flow on
highway and urban networks, [4-6]. The CA model is designed to describe stochastic
interaction between individual vehicles, independently of headway distribution and
can be applied to most features of traffic flow, whether or not these can be described
by a theoretical distribution. Features modelled may include multi-streams on the
major road, heterogeneous vehicles (passenger and heavy vehicles), and intersections
with or without flaring.

Background

The basic assumption of gap-acceptance models is that the driver will enter the
intersection when a safe opportunity or “gap” occurs in the traffic. Gaps are measured
in time and correspond to headway, (defined as distance divided by speed). Critical
gap and follow-up time are the two main parameters, where the critical gap is defined
as the minimum length of time interval that allows one minor-stream vehicle to enter
the intersection. The follow-up time is the time span between two departing vehicles,
under the condition of continuous queueing.
Gap-acceptance models are, however, unrealistic in assuming that drivers are
consistent and homogenous [7, 8]. A consistent driver would be expected to behave in
the same way in all similar situations, while in a homogenous population, all drivers
have the same critical gap and are expected to behave uniformly [9]. In any
simulation, therefore, driver type may differ and the critical gap for a particular
driver should be represented by a stochastic distribution, Bottom and Ashworth [10].
In gap acceptance models, estimation of the critical gap has attracted much
attention, with use of a mean critical gap also proposed [11-13]. Maximum likelihood
estimation of the mean critical gap has been widely accepted [3, 12-15], but the basic
assumption is still that all drivers are consistent.
Tian et al. [16] investigated the factors affecting critical gap and follow-up time,
concluding that drivers use shorter critical gap at higher flow and delay conditions.
Many other factors have also been found to affect critical gap [16-18], so that a
critical value, obtained for any given situation, is unlikely to be generally applicable.
Further, gap-acceptance models have failed to consider conflicts between the two
major-streams. When right-turning vehicles (for left-side driving) in the major-stream
of a narrow road give way to straight-through vehicles from the opposing stream, a
queue will form on the major-stream behind the subject vehicle, (i.e. turning-left and
going-straight vehicles share the same lane). The headway distributions are affected
so that original gap-acceptance criteria no longer apply.
At an unsignalised intersection in an urban network, adjacent intersections with
traffic lights will have grouped the vehicles into a queue (or queues) during the red
signal phases, and platoons will thus be present, (i.e. a filtering effect). The filtering
of traffic flow by traffic signals has a significant impact on capacity and performance
[19]. In particular, the gap-acceptance model can be applied only when no platoon is
present [20]. Otherwise, no minor-stream vehicle can enter the intersection, as the
mean headway within a platoon is supposed to be less than the critical gap. If traffic
signal cycles are known and co-ordinated, the platoon pattern may be predictable.
Otherwise, traditional gap-acceptance is not readily applied [20].
Headway distributions are also affected by traffic lights and in absence of these,
platoon formation will occur due to the vehicle speeds. Further, critical gap is not
easy to define and implement when several traffic streams are involved [3] and gapacceptance does not specifically allow for modelling directional flow [16].
A CA model is thus proposed, using analogous but more flexible methodology
compared to gap acceptance, (e.g. spatial and temporal details of vehicle interactions
can be described). This not only facilitates understanding of the interaction between
the drivers, but can also be applied to situations for which headway distributions are
insufficient to describe traffic flow.

A CA ring was firstly proposed for unsignalised intersections [5,21]. All entry
roads are “connected” on the ring. The car “on the ring” has priority over any new
entry. However, there is no differentiation between the major and minor entry roads
and all vehicles have equal priority to move into the ring (intersection), which
compromises usual TWSC rules. Another CA model variant for intersection is
described [22].

Methodology

A two-speed one-dimensional deterministic CA model, [5, 23, 24], is used to simulate
interaction between drivers on the intersection. The speed of a vehicle is either 0 or 1;
i.e. the vehicle can move only one cell in a time-step, (1 second for our model). The
length of each cell corresponds to an “average speed” on a given section of the road,
e.g. length of 1 cell ≅ 13.9 m for speed of 50km/h.
While multi-speed models [4] are somewhat similar, these have many features,
which are superfluous for urban features, or to representation of driver behaviour [5].
Moreover, vehicle dynamics are often less important than driver interactions in
simulating queue formation in urban networks [21].
A multi-speed one-dimensional deterministic CA model [4, 25] is used here to
model the traffic flow on the straight road. Speed of vehicles is 0, 1 or 2,
corresponding to speed of 0, 25km/h and 50km/h. Length of 1 cell ≅ 7 m. The update
rules for each time-step are:
• Vehicle moves v (= 0, 1 or 2) cells ahead.
• Find the number of empty cells ahead = E
• If v < E and v< vmax(=2), then v increased to v+1
• If v ≥ E, then v = E

Fig. 1. Two-stream intersections with a rational driver D

A two-stream intersection (Fig. 1) is used to illustrate the driver interaction. Three
cells give the minimum theoretical acceptable space for non-interruption of majorstream.
Drivers are categorised as aggressive, rational and conservative. A driver
accepting a 3-cell space as the minimum acceptable space (MAP) is rational. A 2-cell
space corresponds to aggressive behaviour. The effect is the blocking of the vehicle
that has priority by the sub-rank vehicle. Conservative behaviour corresponds to MAP
≥ 4 cells. Drivers are likely to prefer longer gaps for the more complex decision
involved in turning, even though longer gaps are not required theoretically [17]. We
assume therefore that most driver behaviour can be classified as rational or

conservative. Probabilities associated with driver types sum to 1. Drivers are
randomly reassigned to different categories with given probabilities at each time step,
prior to checking whether the space meets the MAP. In this way, heterogeneity and
inconsistency of driver behaviour are incorporated.
According to the rules of the road, a vehicle from a minor-stream has to obey a
stop sign before it can enter an intersection. Our simulation ensures that all vehicles
from the minor-stream will stop for at least one time-step (equal to 1 second). For
minor-stream vehicles travelling straight-ahead or right-turning, two time-steps delay
is allowed, in order to make a decision, (two major-streams are checked). We denote
the time required as stop-sign-delay-time (SSDT). Thus, the follow-up time for a
minor-stream in the simulation will be from 3 to 4 seconds, which agrees with the
recommended follow-up time from observed data [16].
The main difference between our CA model and gap-acceptance models, in
general, is that the critical gap in the gap-acceptance model and the MAP in our
model have different temporal and spatial content, although both provide criteria for a
driver to take action. For the gap-acceptance model, where the conflicting flow
includes more than two streams, the gap is normally defined as the time taken for two
vehicles from conflicting streams to pass through the path of the subject vehicle.
Without distinguishing the direction that each vehicle comes from, the critical gap
then has strong temporal meaning but is weak in spatial detail. However, in our
model, the space required (in terms of different number of vacant cells required in
each conflicting stream) is clearly specified so that temporal and spatial details are
known for each different movement precisely for different streams (details below),
and the driver decision process is thus fully specified. Also, the critical gap is a fixed
single value, whereas the MAP is a multi-value distribution corresponding to the
distribution of driver behaviour.

For TWSC, conditions for the marked SA vehicle V to move into the intersection are
illustrated. A rational driver needs to observe the 8 marked cells before s/he can drive
into the intersection (Fig. 2a), whereas a conservative driver needs to check 10 cells.
The marked cells, 0, a, b and c, correspond to: “0” cell is vacant, “a” cell either vacant

or occupied by a vehicle that will turn left, “b” cell not occupied by a right-turning
vehicle and “c” cell either occupied by a right-turning vehicle or vacant.
In Fig. 2b, a SA or LT vehicle from the opposing minor-stream in cell marked “c”
also has priority over the RT vehicle V from the given minor-stream according to the
rules of the road. However, Tian et al. [16] indicated that priorities between minorstream vehicles might not be distinct. They indicated that drivers were observed to
enter the intersection on a first-come, first-served basis. The movement of a RT
vehicle from a minor-stream does not need to consider opposing vehicles if one of the
following conditions is met.
• The first cell in the opposing minor-stream is vacant
• A RT vehicle is the first vehicle in the opposing minor-stream
• The first vehicle in the opposing minor-stream arrives at a stop-line in less than

Similar conditions apply to a driver turning left from a minor-stream (MiLT) and right

marked cells before entering the intersection (Fig.3a), whereas a MaRT vehicle R
needs to check 3 marked cells (Fig.3b).

3.4 Long Vehicles and Modified Intersections
The case for a long vehicle has been considered briefly, based on occupation of two
cells (Fig. 4). Crudely, rational movement for long vehicle through the intersection
requires a check on 10 cells (as for conservative car driver) in the simple model.
Preliminary results indicate that long vehicles reduce throughput, as expected, but the
impact of distributional assumptions has yet to be investigated. Flared minor-stream
increases (e.g. [20]), can also be accommodated in our model, but have not been
investigated to date.

4. Model Implementation and Results
Based on assumptions described, we studied performance, (capacity, time delay and
queue-length) of a TWSC intersection under different values of traffic flow
parameters, such as arrival rate (traffic volume) and turning rate (turning proportion).
Experiments were carried out for 36,000 time-steps (equivalent to 10 hours) for a
street-length of 100 cells on all approaches. All driver behaviour was assumed
rational unless otherwise specified. Vehicles arrive according to a Poisson
distribution, (where λ ≤ 0.5 (equivalent to 1800vph) in general for free flow). If all
arriving vehicles pass the intersection without queueing, the flow rate λ=0.1, 0.2,
0.3… equivalents are 360vph, 720vph, 1080vph… respectively.
4.1 Capacity of a Minor-street
When a RT or SA vehicle from a minor-street involves two major-streams, the
capacity depends on their flow rates and configurations. In order to determine impact
of different turning rates and different major-stream combinations, a TWSC
intersection is studied, which contains only right-turning and left-turning vehicles in
the minor-stream.. All major-streams are assumed to have only SA vehicles. The total
number of vehicles per hour in major-streams is assumed to be 1440 vph, which is
split between the near-lane stream, (vehicles coming from the right), and far-lane
stream, (vehicles coming from the left). Both left-turning-rate (LTR) and rightturning-rate (RTR) are varied. The differences in turning rates of the minor-stream
can be expressed in terms of turning rate ratio (TRR =left-turning rate: right-turning
rate). The difference in flow rates of the two major-streams can be expressed in terms
of flow rate ratio (FRR= flow rate of near-lane stream: flow rate of far- lane stream).

Table 1 indicates that both TRR and FRR affect capacity. TRR has been varied by
increasing the number of right-turning vehicles in the minor-street. We find that the
capacity of the minor-stream decreases in general when TRR decreases. However,
this effect differs as FRR varies. When FRR increases (by increasing flow rate of near
lane), the decrease in capacity is less marked, and vice versa.

MaRT in a shared major-street, where right-turning, straight-going and left-turning
vehicles are on the one lane, can block SA and LT vehicles behind and in the same
stream. Right-turning rates (RTR) of major-streams thus have great impact on
capacities of major-streams. Two configurations have been studied (Fig. 5), with the
analysis of major-street capacity following that of Chodur [26].

Fig. 6 shows unsurprisingly that the capacity of the major-stream declines rapidly
with RTR as flow rate of the conflicting major-stream increases (Fig.5a). Similarly,
Table. 2 with RT vehicles in both major-streams yields a similar relation to that found
for gap- acceptance by Chodur [26], with Capacity1: Capacity 2 = RTR2: RTR1.
4.3 Queue-length and Delay
Minor stream queue-length is found to depend on degree of saturation, d (= flow
rate/capacity) and also on arrival and turning rates of major and minor streams. For
example, for LTR: SAR: RTR = 0.2:0.7:0.1 and FRR=0.15:0.15 on the major stream
even a low arrival rate on the minor road leads to rapid queue build-up. Thus, for d
=0.9 (λ≅ 0.13) say on the minor approach, queue length builds to 34 cells with
maximum delay time of 89 seconds. However, 50% of driver experience delay < 18
seconds.

Fig. 7. Capacity of major-stream for Fig. 5a (aggressive, rational and conservative driver
behaviour)

The effect of driver behaviour is to produce a series of capacity curves, similar to
those for RTR (Fig5a). RTRs are fixed at 0.5 in the major stream (Fig7). Aggressive
behaviour obviously increases the capacity, whereas conservative behaviour decreases
it. The difference in capacity induced by driver behaviour is less-marked for low and
high level of conflicting flow (where capacity eventually → 0), but is most noticeable
for conflicting flow rate is 1080vph--up to 40% difference in capacity as a result of
aggressive as opposed to conservative behaviour is observed for conflicting flow rates
between 720 to 1440 vph.
Table.3 illustrates effects of different driver behaviour populations on capacity
figures. In each scenario, turning rates and arrival rates are fixed. λ1,2 or 3 < 0.5, λ4=0.8
>> 0.5 for approach 4 (minor-stream) only.
An approximate linear relationship is observed between capacities and driver
behaviour ratio. Hence driver behaviour roughly determines the capacity of an
unsignalised TWSC intersection.

Summary

A cellular automata model is used to simulate directly the interactions between
drivers at a TWSC intersection using detailed space considerations. Heterogeneity and
inconsistency of driver behaviour are also investigated and driver distribution is
shown to have noticeable impact on capacity of major and minor streams, where a
distribution, biased in favour of conservative driver behaviour, leads to a reduction.
The capacity of the minor-stream is shown to depend not only on the flow rates of
major-streams, but also on flow rate ratios. The capacity of a minor-stream decreases
when LTR decreases, but is less marked for FRR increases, which depends on
increased flow rate of the near-lane.
Lacking real data, the distribution of driver behaviour is arbitrarily decided in the
experiments, but the model can be used to investigate various assumptions and
conditions of performance for TWSC intersections together with other features of
urban traffic for which gap-acceptance models are less applicable.
