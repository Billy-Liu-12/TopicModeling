Abstract.We propose the simulation of a oil recovery by means of a molecular type approach. By using a finite set of particles under the interaction of a Lennard-Jones type potential we simulate the behavior of a fluid
in a porous media, and we show under certain conditions the fingering
phenomena appears.

Introduction
In this work we propose the simulation of oil recovery by means of a molecular
type approach. This means that we consider the materials to be composed of a
finite number of particles, which are approximates for molecules. Porous flow is
studied qualitatively under the assumption that particles of rock, oil and the
flooding flow interact with each other by means of a compensating LennardJones type potential. We also consider the system to be under the influence of
gravity. We study miscible displacement in an oil reservoir from various sets of
initial data. The velocity and the rate of injection of the ingoing particles proved
to be among the most important parameters that can be adjusted to increase the
rate of production. It is also noted that the fingering phenomenon is readily detected.
This simulation technique has been used in [1-2] and [4] to simulate several
physical systems. Details of this method applied to the study of porous flow can
be founded in [3].

Model formulation
Consider a rectangular region R, which is a porous medium. We assume that in
this region we have a resident fluid or oil. We shall introduce a different kind of

fluid which, as a matter of convenience, will be called water, although it is an
aqueous solution which could be a polymeric solution, surfactant solution or a
brine. The physical system consists of
N = N 1 + N 2 + N 3 particles,

P1, P2 ,..., PN , with masses m1 , m2 ,..., mN . The particles
P1, P2 ,..., PN1 , Represent rocks,

PN1 +1 ,..., PN1 + N2 , Oil, and

PN1 + N2 +1 ,..., PN , Incoming water.
For purposes of injection of water and production of oil, two wells are opened,
one in the bottom left corner of R, for injection, and other in the diagonally opposite corner for production, see Fig. 1.
The variables at time t = k∆t , are:

r i ,k

Coordinates of the particle Pi ,

ri , j ,k

Distance between the particles Pi and Pj ,

v i ,k

Velocity of the particle Pi ,

a i ,k

Acceleration of the particle Pi ,

F i , j , k Local force exerted on Pi by Pj ,
F *i , k Local force acting on Pi due to the other particles

f i ,k

Long range force acting on Pi (like gravity),

F i ,k

Total force on particle Pi

for i=1,2, . . . , N and k 0, 1, …

The local force

F i , j , k exerted on Pi by Pj is

F i , j ,k

 H i , j Gi , j  r j , k − r i , k
= mi m j  qi , j − pi , j 
,
 ri , j ,k ri , j ,k  ri , j ,k

(1)

where the values of the parameters H i , j , Gi , j , qi , j and pi , j depend on the
particles which are interacting. The total local force F *i , k acting on particle Pi
due to the other particles is given by:

F *i ,k =

N

∑ F i , j ,k .

(2)

j =1, j ≠ i

Therefore, the total force acting upon the particle Pi is

F i ,k = F *i ,k + f i ,k .

(3)

The aceleration of Pi is related to the force by Newton´s Law

F i , k = mi a i , k .
In general system
(4) can not be solved analytically from given initial
positions and velocities, therefore it must be solved numerically. For economy,
simplicity and relatively numerical stability we use the" leap frog" formulae,
which is second-order accuracy in time.

The number of calculations required to evaluate (1) at each iteration is

O( N 2 ) . However this number is much smaller if the potential is truncated for a
distance greater than rc .

Boundary conditions
We assume that the particles of the fluids loose energy when they interact with
the walls of the region R,. therefore it will be necessary to model the hardness of
the wall relative to the reflection of the interacting fluid, and it is done by using
the following damping factors acting on the velocity of the reflected particles.

δ i = 0.4 for i = N 1 + 1,..., N 1 + N 2
δ i = 0.8 for i = N 1 + N 2 + 1,..., N

Initial conditions

The rock and oil particles, for two an three dimensions; were set up at the initial
time in such a way that they satisfied an equilibrium state, as shown in Fig. 1.

Numerical results in 2D
Figure 2 shows the system evolution. All the examples were run with time step
∆t = E − 5 on the Sun workstation Ultra 60, the distance between particles of
water before going to into the well was d = 0.5 and their velocity was
v = 15.0 . The gravity constant was equal to g = 9.8 . The Lennard-Jones potential parameters are summarized in table 1.

Figure 3 shows the advancement of water for different times, the shaded area
is the region which has been traveled only by water this means that not oil particle has been in that area for some time.
Figure 4 shows the number of particles of oil out and the number of particles
of water out versus time. We can see from the graph that for t small, the rate of
oil production is higher when v is higher. We can also observe that water comes
out of the production well sooner for v=100 than for v=15.

produces an increment on the oil and water production.
