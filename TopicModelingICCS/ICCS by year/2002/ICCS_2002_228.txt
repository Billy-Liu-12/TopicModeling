Abstract. In the present paper it is planned to develop mathematical model for description of
heat and mass transfer processes at crown forest fire spread. The paper suggested in the context
of the general mathematical model of forest fires [1] gives a new mathematical setting and
method of numerical solution of a problem of a forest fire spread. It was based on numerical
solution of two dimensional Reynolds equations for the description of turbulent flow taking
into account for diffusion equations chemical components and equations of energy conservation
for gaseous and condensed phases. To obtain discrete analogies a method of controlled volume
[2] was used. Numerical solution of this problem during surface and crown fires in exemplified
heat energy release in the forest fire front was found.

1. Introduction
The research was made by means of the mathematical modeling methods of physical processes
[3]. It was based on numerical solution of two dimensional Reynolds equations for the
description of turbulent flow taking into account for diffusion equations chemical components
and equations of energy conservation for gaseous and condensed phases. Powerful up-currents
of gas occur in surface and crown forest fires, causing entrapment of heated gaseous
combustion products of forest fuels in the ground layer. In this context, a study - mathematical
modeling - of the conditions of forest fire spreading that would make it possible to obtain a
detailed picture of the change in the velocity, temperature and component concentration fields
with time, and determine as well as the limiting conditions of forest fire propagation is of
interest.

2. Forest fire equations
Let us examine a plane problem of radiation-convection heat and mass exchange of forest fuels
in all forest strata with gaseous combustion products and radiation from the tongue of flame of
the surface forest fire. The surface fire source is modeled as a plane layer of burning forest
fuels with known temperature and increasing area of burning. It is assumed that the forest
during a forest fire can be modeled as a two-temperature multiphase non-deformable porous
reactive medium [1]. Let there be a so-called “ventilated” forest massif, in which the volume of
fractions of condensed forest fuel phases, consisting of dry organic matter, water in liquid state,
solid pyrolysis products, and ash, can be neglected compared to the volume fraction of gas
phase (components of air and gaseous pyrolysis products). To describe the transfer of energy by

radiation we use a diffusion approximation, while to describe convective transfer controlled by
the wind and gravity, we use Reynolds equations.
Let the coordinate reference point x1, x2 x3= 0 be situated at the center of the forest fire
source, axis 0x3 directed upward, axis 0x1 and 0x2 directed parallel to the Earth’s surface(x1 - to
the right in the direction of the unperturbed wind speed, x2 – perpendiculary of the wind
direction).
Because of the horizontal sizes of forest massif more than height of forest – h, system of
equations of general mathematical model of forest fire [1] was integrated between the limits
from height of the roughness level - 0 to h. Besides, suppose that

The system of equations (1) – (9) must be solved taking into account the following initial and
boundary conditions:

Because of the patterns of flow and distribution of all scalar functions are symmetrical
relative to the axis 0x2.
Here and above

d
dt

is the symbol of the total (substantial) derivative; αv is the coefficient

of heat and mass exchange; t is time; xi, vi, (i = 1, 2) are the Cartesian coordinates (x and y )

and the velocity components; index α=1,2,3, where 1 corresponds to the density of oxygen, 2 to carbon monoxide CO, 3 – concentration of inert components of air; Ve – equilibrium wind
velocity.
The thermodynamic, thermophysical and structural characteristics correspond to the forest
fuels in the canopy of a pine forest [1]. To define source terms, which characterize inflow
(outflow of mass) in a volume unit of the gas-dispersed phase, the following formulae (9) were
used for the rate of forming of the gas-dispersed mixture Q, outflow of oxygen
changing carbon monoxide

R51

and

R52 . The source of ignition is defined as a function of time and

turned off after the forest fire initiation.
Thus, the solution of the system of equations (1) - (9) with initial and boundary conditions
(10) - (15) may result in defining the fields of velocity, temperature, component concentrations
and radiation density.

The system of equations (1)–(8) contains terms associated with turbulent diffusion, thermal
conduction, and convection, and needs to be closed. The components of the tensor of turbulent
stresses,

ρ vi′v j′

as well as the turbulent fluxes of heat and mass

ρc p vi′T ′ , ρvi′cα′

are

written in terms of the gradients of the average flow properties using the formulas:

λ t = µ t c p / PrT , ρDt = µ t / ScT , µ t = c µ ρK 2 / ε ,
where µt, λt, Dt are the coefficients of turbulent viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion,
respectively; Prt, Sct are the turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, which were assumed to be
equal to 1. The coefficient of dynamic turbulent viscosity is determined using the localequilibrium model of turbulence [1].

3. The method of solution
The boundary-value problem (1) – (15) was solved numerically using the method of splitting
according to physical processes. In the first stage, the hydrodynamic pattern of flow and
distribution of scalar functions was calculated. The system of ordinary differential equations of
chemical kinetics obtained as a result of splitting was then integrated. A discrete analog for
equations (1) – (9) was obtained by means of the control volume method using the SIMPLE
algorithm [2,3].
The accuracy of the program was checked by the method of inserted analytical solutions.
Analytical expressions for the unknown functions were substituted in (1)–(9) and the closure of
the equations were calculated. This was then treated as the source in each equation. Next, with
the aid of the algorithm described above, the values of the functions used were inferred with an
accuracy of not less than 1%. The effect of the dimensions of the control volumes on the
solution was studied by diminishing them. The time step for chemical stage was selected
automatically.

4. Typical calculated results and discussion
Fields of velocity, temperature, component mass fractions, volume fractions of phases were
obtained numerically. The distribution of basic functions shows that the process goes through
the some stages. As a result of heating of forest fuel elements, moisture evaporates, and
pyrolysis occurs accompanied by the release of gaseous products, which then ignite. and burn
away in the forest canopy.
In the vicinity of the source of heat and mass release, heated air masses and products of
pyrolysis and combustion float up. At Ve ≠ 0, the wind field in the forest canopy interacts with
the gas-jet obstacle that forms from the surface forest fire source and from the ignited forest
canopy base. On the windward side the movement of the air flowing past the ignition region
accelerates (Fig. 1).

the forest canopy and deformed by the action of wind. Similarly, the fields of component
concentrations are deformed. The distribution of the same functions (Fig. 6 – 11) show that the
forest fire begins spread. High temperature zone is removed in x1 – direction (Fig. 6). Of
interest is the investigation of the influence forest combustible materials properties (moisture,
density and etc) and wind velocity on the rate of front fire spread.

The obtained results are agree with the laws of physics and experimental data [1].
