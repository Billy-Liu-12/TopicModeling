Abstract. The main topic of this paper is to define the quality index of
adaptation of a system and to present a method to find the necessary number of
nominal models of an adaptive reference model control systems using multiple
models so that the system have a desired quality of adaptation.

1. Introduction
The method of adaptation of the adaptive reference control systems using multiple
models consist of identification of the real model of the system, the selection of the
nominal model and then the selection of the reference model most appropriate to the
functioning condition of the system [4]. It is necessary a certain number of nominal
models for obtaining the prescribed quality of the system. The domain of the
parameters space is bounded for the adaptive reference model control systems using
multiple models. This allows us to partitioner it in sub-domains, every sub-domain
having a model in his center. The quality of adaptation will be evaluate for a system
with constant parameters coresponding to the center of the sub-domain.
For a good understanding first it is necessary to define the quality index of
adaptation.

2. Evaluating Quality of Adaptive Control Systems
Adaptive control systems theory gives us solutions for growing control quality
(because of the adaptive algorithm that adaptive control systems have), but not for the
evaluation of the improving degree of the quality.
To eliminate this difficulty the evaluation of the adaptation quality as the ratio of
two ‚Äûvolumes‚Äù of system performance characteristics space is a possible solution
[1,2].
Because the automatic control systems without adaptive controller are many
times unstable, first we must define a stabilization index as the ratio

Qs = N s N

(1)

where N is the number of all analysed cases and N s is the number of stable cases.
For the adaptive system (which is stable in all the cases) we first define an
adaptation quality index as the ratio of two ‚Äúvolumes‚Äù of systems performance
characteristics space (domain)
Qa = Va Vna ,

(2)

where Vna is the ‚Äûvolume‚Äù of non-adaptive control system obtained for worst-case
analysis and Va is the same ‚Äûvolume‚Äù for adaptive control system, computed only for
the N s cases in which the non adaptive system is stable.
Qs is necessary to eliminate from analysis the cases that leads to insignificant
values for the Qa index (for example if the system is unstable Vna grows to infinity
and the Qa index becomes zero). For comparing the adaptation quality of the same
process with different adaptive controller the Qa index is used.
The Vna ‚Äúvolume‚Äù is given by
p

Vna = ‚àè (Œ≥ i max ‚àí Œ≥ i min ) ,

(3)

i =1

where: Œ≥ = (Œ≥ 1 , Œ≥ 2 ,..., Œ≥ p ) is the system performance characteristics vector;

Œ≥ i max and Œ≥ i min are the maximum, respectively the minimum, value of the ith parameter of the system performance characteristics vector;
The maximum and minimum values of the system performance characteristics
are obtained from its mathematical model by applying the worth-case method:
m

Ô£∂
Œ≥ i max = Œ≥ inom + ‚àÜŒ≥ i = Œ≥ inom Ô£¨1 + ‚àë SŒ¥Œ≥ ij ‚àÜŒ¥ j Œ¥ jnom Ô£∑

j =1
Ô£≠
Ô£∏

(5)

where: Œ≥ inom is the nominal value of the i-th parameter of the system performance
characteristics vector;
‚àÜŒ≥ i is the tolerance of the i-th

parameter of the system performance

characteristics vector;
Œ¥ = (Œ¥ 1 , Œ¥ 2 ,..., Œ¥ m ) is the input parameters vector of the system;
SŒ¥Œ≥ ij is the sensitivity of the i-th

parameter of the system performance

characteristics vector with respect to the j-th input parameter of the system;
Œ¥ jnom is the nominal value of the j-th input parameter of the system;

‚àÜŒ¥ j is the tolerance of the j-th input parameter of the system;

The Va ‚Äûvolume‚Äù depend on used adaptive method.

3. The Quality of Reference Model Adaptive Control Systems
There are two classes of the adaptive control systems with reference model: adaptive
control systems with explicit reference model and adaptive control systems with nonexplicit reference model.
The obtaining of the Va ‚Äûvolume‚Äù for every type of adaptive control system
differs, and depend on two possible situations:
‚àí both the compensated and uncompensated system can be characterized by the
same system performance characteristics vector;
‚àí the compensated system and uncompensated system can not be characterized
by the same system performance characteristics vector (e.g. the uncompensated
system has overshoot and compensated system has not).
Case 1. Both the compensated and non-compensated systems has the same
system performance characteristics vector.
The Va ‚Äûvolume‚Äù depend on used adaptive method. For adaptive control
systems with explicit reference model the Va ‚Äûvolume‚Äù depend on the precision of
the model realization:
p

Va = ‚àè (Œ≥ iM max ‚àí Œ≥ iM min ) ,

(6)

i =1

where: Œ≥ = (Œ≥ 1M , Œ≥ 2 M ,..., Œ≥ pM ) is the system performance characteristics vector of the
model;

Œ≥ iM max and Œ≥ iM min are the maximum, respectively the minimum, value of the
i-th parameter of the system performance characteristics vector of the model;
Œ≥ iM max and Œ≥ iM min depend on the realized tolerance of the model and can be
obtained similarly as (4), (5) if we applied the worst - case method.
For adaptive control system with non-explicit reference model the Va ‚Äûvolume‚Äô
is given by (6), but the extreme values of the reference depend on the precision that
model must realize:
Œ≥ iM max = Œ≥ iMnom + Œµ iM

(7)

Œ≥ iM min = Œ≥ iMnom ‚àí Œµ iM ,

(8)

where: Œ≥ iMnom is the nominal value of the i-th parameter of the system performance
characteristics vector of the reference model;
Œµ iM is the maximum admissible error of the value of the i-th parameter of
the system performance characteristics vector of the reference model.

Case 2. Both the compensated and uncompensated systems are not characterized
by the same system performance characteristics vector.
It is better that the Va ‚Äúvolume‚Äù to be estimated with an integral error criterion
[3] and the Qa index is obtained as:
Qa = I a I na ,

(9)

where I na is the integral error performance index of non-adaptive control system and
I a is the same integral error performance index for adaptive control system.
We will choose the criterion that is most appropriate for the functional requests
of the system.

4. The Quality Evaluation of Reference Model Using Multiple Models Adaptive
Control Systems
The method of adaptation of the reference using multiple models adaptive control
systems consist of identification of the real model of the system, the selection of the
nominal model and then the selection of the reference model most appropriate to the
functioning condition of the system [4].
The method allows to find the minimal number of nominal models so that the
adaptation have a desired quality ( Œµ iM have a maximum admissible value).
Because the problem is very difficult in gebneral case we will present using as
an example the second order system [4] with transfer function:
H (s ) = œâ n

2

(s

2

+ 2Œæœâ n s + œâ n

2

)

(10)

The natural radian frequency œâ n is varying on the interval [0.21; 0.9] , and the
damping factor Œæ is constant Œæ = 0.15 . Suppose to have three nominal models with
transfer function (10) and the natural radian frequency œâ n1 = 0.21 , œâ n 2 = 0.55 and
œâ n3 = 0.9 .
The reference model has the transfer function [4]:
H M (s ) = 1 Ô£ÆÔ£∞(5s + 1)(3s + 1)Ô£πÔ£ª .
(11)
The control laws are so that the dynamics of the system for the three natural
radian frequencies above presented is the same to the model reference dynamics.
To select the nominal model M UJ ULW[4] uses a method similarly to the smallest
square method, the maximum error in selection the nominal model being made when
the real value of the parameter ( œâ n in this case) is the middle between two nominal
values.
The system performance characteristics and the reference model performance
characteristics are the maximum overshoot œÉ , respectively œÉ M , the settling time t t ,
respectively ttM , whose nominal values, calculated from (11), are œÉ nom = œÉ Mnom = 0

and ttnom = ttMnom = 27.556 s for a steady state error of 1% (in all experiments
following).
The non-adaptive system performance characteristics, with the natural radian
frequency of the nominal model œâ n 2 = 0.55 can be seen in table 1.

From table 1 we can see that for non adaptive system œÉ max = 5.05% ,
œÉ min = 0% , tt max = 113.684 s, tt min = 27.556 s, and the ‚Äûvolume‚Äù Vna will be:
Vna = (œÉ max ‚àí œÉ min )(tt max ‚àí tt min ) = (5.05-0)(113.684-27.556) = 434.7545.

models œâ n1 = 0.21 , œâ n 2 = 0.55 and œâ n3 = 0.9 can be seen in table 2.

From table 2 we can see that for the adaptive system œÉ max = 1.747% ,
œÉ min = 0% , tt max = 56.31 s , tt min = 27.556 s, and the ‚Äûvolume‚Äù Va will be:
Va = (œÉ max ‚àí œÉ min )(tt max ‚àí tt min ) = (1.747-0)(56.31-27.556) = 50.2332.

Taking into account the relations (2), (12) and (13), the quality index of
adaptation is:

(13

Qa = Va Vna = 50, 2332 434, 7545 = 0,1155 .

(14)

From (13) and (14) we can see that for 3 nominal models uniform distributed
Va = 50.2332 , Qa = 0.1155 and the adaptive system diminishes more than 8 times
the ‚Äúvolume‚Äù in system performance characteristics space.
We can not see a very high improving in the quality of the adaptive system
compared with non-adaptive systems because the number of the nominal models is
small (only three). To obtain a high improving of quality we can find the number of
nominal models so that, for example the system performance characteristics differ no
more than ¬±10% of nominal values. Table 3 shows us the results obtained by taking
10 nominal models uniform distributed (the interval of variation of œâ n is divided in
10 equal intervals).

From table 3 we can see that for the adaptive system œÉ max = 1.082% ,
œÉ min = 0% , tt max = 44.750 s , tt min = 27.056 s and the ‚Äûvolume‚Äù Va will be:
Va = (œÉ max ‚àí œÉ min )(tt max ‚àí tt min ) = (1.082-0)(44.750-27.056) = 19.1449.

(15)

Taking into account the relations (2), (12) and (15), the adaptation quality index
is:
Qa = Va Vna = 19.1449 434.7545 = 0.044 .

(16)

From (16) we can see that for 10 nominal models uniform distributed
Va = 19.1449 , Qa = 0.044 and the adaptive system diminishes more than 22 times
the ‚Äúvolume‚Äù in system performance characteristics space.
Also, we can see that the system performance characteristics have high
tolerances for small values of natural radian frequencies and small tolerances for high
values of natural radian frequencies. To improve the quality of adaptation is
necessary to have the nominal models optimal distributed. Table 4 shows us the
results obtained by taking 10 nominal models optimal distributed.

From table 4 we can see that for the adaptive system œÉ max = 0.315%. œÉ min = 0%,
tt max = 30.222s , tt min = 27.0375s and the ‚Äûvolume‚Äù Va will be:
Va = (œÉ max ‚àí œÉ min )(tt max ‚àí tt min ) = (0.315-0)(30.222-27.037) = 1.0033.

(17)

Taking into account the relations (2), (12) and (17), the adaptation quality index
is:
Qa = Va Vna = 1.0033 434.7545 = 0.002308 ,

(18)

showing that for 10 reference models optimal distributed Va = 1.0033 ,
Qa = 0.002308 and the adaptive system diminishes more than 433 times the
‚Äúvolume‚Äù in system performance characteristics space.

5. Conclusions
The method allows, now only by trying, to find the number and parameters of the
nominal models of a model reference using multiple models adaptive control system.
We obtain a high improving of the quality of the system by an optimal choice of the
parameters of nominal models without any change in the number of nominal
models.To find an analytical method of determination the optimal number of nominal
models and theirs parameters is an idea for future research.
