Abstract. This paper discusses some metrics and models aiming at quantifying
the heterogeneity level of distributed computing systems. These metrics are
evaluated through experimental case studies over distributed computing systems. These results show that these metrics and models are not very general as
suggested in the literature. A new approach to apply the metrics and models
studied, in order to fulfill the needs of the distributed computing area is suggested in this paper.

1 Introduction
The use of heterogeneous computing systems has offered good opportunities for
improving the performance of computer applications by an adequate placement of the
computer tasks on the processors. Although the heterogeneity provides great flexibility there are new issues that must be dealt with, such as portability and process
scheduling.
The process scheduling must be performed with accuracy in order to obtain
the best utilization of the available computing system. Bad scheduling decisions can
lead to poor overall system performance. Thus, it is important to provide metrics to
evaluate the heterogeneity of a system, taking to a better understanding of the performance differences among the processors available in a distributed computing system. These heterogeneity metrics can be used in a variety of ways; for instance, computer schedulers can use this information for calculating more accurate performance
indices, allowing better scheduling decisions. Furthermore, performance metrics
widely used in homogeneous computing systems such as speedup, efficiency and
response times [2] [3] [4] can be better characterized with the knowledge of the heterogeneity level of the system.

This paper analysis some existing metrics [1] [6] and models aiming at
evaluating the heterogeneity level [5] [1] [6] [7] of computer systems, by means of
both experimental and theoretical evaluations, together with some case studies. The
paper shows the weaknesses of the existing metrics and points out the scenarios
where these metrics can be applied with good results.

2 Overview Of Metrics And Models For Heterogeneity Level
Some models and metrics for heterogeneous systems were proposed by Zhang and
Yan [1], where heterogeneous computing systems can be represented by a graph
(M,C) where M={M1,M2,M3,M4,M5....,Mn} is considered a set of heterogeneous workstations (each one having its own computing power that can be measure by CPU, disk
and memory capacity), and C is the communication network linking the workstations
(with a homogeneous bandwidth for all interconnect points).
Aiming at quantifying the heterogeneity among the machines in the system
without complex measurements, Zhang and Yan proposed two metrics to evaluate the
relative computing power among the set of workstations (the capacity of each workstation is evaluated related to the fastest one):
Wi ( A) =

Si ( A)
max in=1{Si ( A)}

(1)

where i=1,...., n and Si(A) is the speed of Mi to execute the application A dedicatedly.
Speed can be defined through the number of basic operations per time unit, for instance, and the computing power of each workstation is represented by a relative
speed.
A second metric proposed is:
Wi ( A) =

min in=1{T ( A, M i )}
T ( A, M i )

(2)

where i=1,....,n and T(A,Mi) is the time to execute the application A in the workstation Mi. Grosu [5] extends these metrics in a way that computing power is given by
the relative speed of the workstation in relation to the slowest one:
Wi ( A) =

min in=1{Si ( A)}
Si ( A)

(3)

where i=1,...., n and Si(A) is the speed of Mi workstation to execute the application A
dedicatedly, and the computing power is given by relative speeds. Furthermore,
Grosu defines
Wi ( A) =

T ( A, M i )
max in=1{T ( A.M i )}

(4)

where i=1,....,n and T(A,Mi) is the time to execute the application A in the workstation Mi.

In this way, equation 1 and 2 are now the basis to get the computing power
f

considering the fastest machine as a reference point, being renamed as Wi (f - fast).
On the other hand, equations 3 and 4 are used to get the computing power based on
s

the slowest machine and is represented by Wi (s - slow). In [1] and [5] four ways to
quantify the heterogeneity level in a system based in the value of W are proposed.
The first and second ones use the standard deviation H1 (that can be calculated based
on the computing powers related either to the fastest or the slowest workstation)

∑

n

H1 =

(Wmed − Wi ) 2

i =1

(5)

n

or the mean absolute deviation, called H2 (also calculated based on the fastest or the
slowest workstation)

H2
where W med

∑
=

n
i =1

Wi

∑
=

n

i =1

Wmed − Wi

(6)

n

.

n

However, in both H1 and H2 the values are observed and analyzed in a uniform way, using the average to get the standard deviation and the mean absolute
deviation. This fact spoils the analysis when there is a reasonable difference among
the workstations computing power, once the standard deviation does not reflect in a
proper way the distance among the samples.
Based on this weakness of the metrics H1 and H2, Zhang and Yan [1] proposed a third metric, H3, calculated from the computing power of the fastest workstation on the computing system:

H3

∑
=

n
i =1

(1 − Wi f ( A))

(7)

n

In a similar way, Grosu [5] defines H4 based on the computing power of the
slowest workstation on the computing system.

H4

∑
=

n

i =1

(1 − Wi s ( A))

(8)

n

In H3, the computing power of the fastest workstation is equal to 1, while in
H4 the slowest machine has computing power of value 1. In this way, H4 represents
the distance (in terms of computing power) between each machine and the fastest
machine and H3 calculates the same distance between each machine and the slowest
one.

Based on his experiments, Grosu [5] states that the metric H4 is more appropriated than H3. However, some case studies presented in this paper show that this is
not true in all situations, as can be seen in tables 1, 2 and 3 and corresponding figures
1, 2 and 3.

Figure 2 – Heterogeneity levels when all the computing powers are far from 1.

In this case, the equation H3 does not represent appropriately how much heterogeneous is a system; on the other hand equation H4 produces a good result. From
these results, it can be wrongly inferred that H4 is the equation that best characterizes
the heterogeneity of a computing system. Its wrong because it is a particular view and
the result cannot be generalized.
Table 3 – The configuration of the machines takes to a situation where half of the machines
have computer powers below the average value and half is above this average. Two different
cases are also presented in this table: a machine with high load and all the other ones with low
value, and one with low load and the other ones with high load.

Figure 3 - Heterogeneity levels where 5 situations are imposed.

Figure 3 shows that there are two cases ((1) 9 machines with computing
powers equal to 1 and 1 machine with computing power equal to 0,5; (2) 9 machines
with computing powers equal to 0,5 and 1 machine with computing power equal to 1)
where the heterogeneity levels (in H3 and H4) should be similar, but they are contradictory. For this reason, new studies are needed taking into consideration the two
evaluation equations once the obtained results do not contemplate the reality.

3 Case Studies
The first case study presents a system composed of 10 workstations where 9 of them
have high and identical speeds and 1 has a low speed. In the second case study it is
considered a system with 9 low speed workstations and 1 high speed workstation.
The third and fourth case studies present an analysis of the existence of 10 different
workstations in the system (highly heterogeneous). The results for these case studies
are presented in tables 4, 5, 6 and 7.
Considering that H3 and H4 produce different values when applied to the
same system it was investigated which value took to a suitable metric. Thus, the
practical requirements of such heterogeneity level call for a heuristic that take into
account the average of the speeds of the machines. If more than 50% of the speed of
the machines are below the average than the H3 must be choose to perform the heterogeneity level, else if more then 50% of the speed of the machines are above the
average then the H4 must be choose to perform the heterogeneity level. Therefore
based on this heuristic, from the calculation of the speed average (650 in the first case
study) and verifying that this value is close to the value of the fastest machines (700),
the heterogeneity level should be calculated by the metric H3 and the value of the
computing power should be calculated in relation to the fastest machine. This complies with the results obtained intuitively, once 9 out of 10 machines are identical and
therefore the system should be considered more homogeneous than heterogeneous.
In the second case study, also considering the average of the speeds (250)
and observing that this average is close to the value of the slowest machines (200),
the calculation of the heterogeneity level should be made through the metric H4 and

the value of the computing power should be calculated in relation to the slowest machine. In this case, the results obtained also comply with the intuitive results, once 9
out of 10 machines are identical and the system should be considered more homogeneous than heterogeneous. The analysis of these two cases studies demonstrates the
need of using the two metrics together instead of just one.
In the third case study, where the speeds are defined based on the highest
heterogeneity level inside a system of 10 machines, it can be concluded intuitively
that the calculation of the heterogeneity level is better when obtained from the metric
H4.
In the fourth case study, where the speeds of the machines are randomly defined in a system of 10 machines, it can be concluded intuitively that the calculation
of the heterogeneity level of that system is more accurately also obtained from the
metric H4. However, using only the average as a parameter for choosing the metric to
be used to obtain the heterogeneity level of a system is not enough because, as observed the third and in the fourth case studies, the number of machines above and
below the average is exactly the same.

The case studies discussed in this paper were based on the mathematical analysis of
the equations presented in H3 and H4, that showed that both equations refer to the
same type of measure and these measures are not complementary or contradictory as
it can be seen in the equations 9 and 10. Still taking as the basis the mathematical
analysis of the equations H3 and H4, it can also be verified that a given system can
totally be homogeneous (value of H3 and H4 equal to 0), but never totally heterogeneous (value of H3 and H4 equal to 1). This is due to the fact that there is not a maximum number of computers that can compose the system and therefore the system can
always be taken to a more heterogeneous configuration.

From the analysis performed it can be observed that the equations are not
identical, suggesting the need of using the right equation to a given system. Furthermore, the two equations do not supply complementary values.
Additionally it can be seen that Hf=1-Mf, and Hs=1-Ms. Thus, if Sm≈SM then

Thus, being S1 , S 2 ,..., S n the speeds of the machines that compose the
system, the average of the speeds can be given by

this average it can be verified the amount of existent machines above and below this
average speed. In case of a larger number of machines with speed above the average
speed, the calculation of the heterogeneity level is made based on the fastest machine.
Otherwise the calculation of the heterogeneity level is made based on the slowest
machine in the system.

5 Final Remarks and Conclusions
From the results obtained from the case studies is evident that is necessary the use of
the metrics H3 and H4 presented in the section 2, instead of just one of them to obtain
the best heterogeneity level of a computing system.
However, it is not enough to use only the average as a parameter for deciding which of the two equations should be used to obtain a good heterogeneity level of
a system because the number of machines above and below the average can be exactly the same. As firstly presented in [1] an expression that quantifies the heterogeneity of a computational system should take into account not only the variance of the
power weight of the machines, but also the effect caused in the system by the presence of slower and faster machines. Further studies are still required aiming at demonstrating the heuristic results proposed in this paper.
