Abstract. Encryption plays an important role in the information society
in that it secures data reliability and confidentiality. Up till now, the
mainstream encryption technology has consisted of conventional encryption represented by DES, and public key encryption, for which
RSA is a typical example. However, these schemes have constantly
been objects of decryption threats, and now they can no longer guarantee reliability due to numerous potential weaknesses. Encryption technique using chaos has been developed as an alternative for providing
solutions to problems of traditional methods. With its sensitive characteristics to initial conditions, it is believed that chaos cannot be solved
with conventional mathematics. Based on the chaos theory, this study
proposes a new DES algorithm using attractor reconstruction method.
This algorithm is verified to be very secure against statistical analysis
or selective plaintext attacks. Furthermore, it is expected to develop
into a Stream Encryption Standard in the future.

1 Introduction
Data protection is recognized as an essential issue in the advanced information society. One of the means of data protection is encryption. The role of encryption has
become especially important in today’s e-commerce environment as a measure for
securing reliability and confidentiality.
Encryption yields data system security by barring malicious deciphers and protecting data confidentiality, and allows anyone to safely engage in data transmission,
shopping, contract signings and financial transactions using large-scale communication networks. Encryption is a fundamental technology which the information society
cannot do without.
Encryption technology can be largely categorized into Conventional Encryption
represented by DES (Data Encryption Standard), and Public Key Encryption, for

which RSA is a typical example. However, DES and RAS are subject to regulations
of the U.S. government, and they also bear numerous problems in terms of stability,
processing speed, and becoming outdated.
For example, studies show that the amount of time it took for Brute Force Attack
to decipher a 56-bit block encryption such as DES was 3.6 hours in 1995, and just 21
minutes in 2000. Accordingly, the U.S. Department of Commerce has been looking
for alternatives to DES since 1998. The DES encryption algorithm is configured with
transposition, substitution and mod-2 operation, and its reliability depends on a substitution device called ‘S-box’[2,3].
Hellman and others analyzed the S-box and announced that the selection of S-box
determines the security of DES. Moreover, they proved that DES security could be
compromised with a vulnerable S-box they have devised[4]. Although they could not
prove vulnerability of a general S-box, these discoveries raise a possibility that DES
may be susceptible to a trap door.
The RSA encryption scheme has solved the key management problem. Nevertheless, it is widely regarded as the ‘encryption algorithm that will ultimately collapse’.
RSA uses the difficulty in prime factorization of composite numbers, and many believe that rapid developments in hardware will consequently reduce the time it takes
to decipher the RSA encryption algorithm.
One of the potential weaknesses of the RSA encryption algorithm is the method of
deciphering a message through repetitive attacks. Rivest calculated the repetitive
encryption cycle of a repetitive attack, and claimed that safeguard conditions against
such attacks are as follows: For prime factors p and q, p-1 and q-1 must have large
factors. Further, p’ and q’, which are factors of p-1 and q-1, respectively, also must
have large factors. However, it is pointed out that these conditions increase the
amount of calculation in the encryption and decryption processes, acting as an obstacle in terms of the processing speed.
Another example is the FEAL-8 (Fast Data Encipherment Algorithm), developed
by NTT of Japan. It is a type of block encryption technique similar to DES. However,
Israel’s A. Shamir has deciphered FEAL-8. As these examples show, whereas encryption is becoming increasingly vital, traditional schemes using mathematical approaches are being threatened in terms of reliability.
In order to overcome these shortcomings, new researches are being conducted in
the field of encryption algorithm using chaos, which has nonlinear characteristics.
These researches have been performed, and this method is acknowledged as the most
complete and secure compared to any other known till this day[1,7].
With its sensitive characteristics to initial conditions, it is believed that chaos cannot be solved with conventional mathematics. Based on the attractor reconstruction
method in chaos theory, this study proposes a new DES Cryptographic Algorithm.

2 Chaos Theory
Chaos refers to a phenomenon with a disorderly superficial appearance, but a stunning internal regularity. While studying weather and unreliable forecasts, Lorentz

Lecture Notes in Computer Science

found out that a little deviation in initial conditions renders completely different consequences. From this observation, he was able to confirm the existence of the aperiodic system that displays similar but never identical repetitions.
Lorentz was able to describe this complex aperiodic system using 3-dimensional
non-linear simultaneous differential equations of first order. Although the system’s
dynamic states did not go out of a certain range, they showed sensitive characteristics
to initial values. This is the so-called ‘Butterfly Effect’, or the Lorentz Attractor.
The outcome of the Lorentz research provided important backgrounds for studies
of James Yorke and Tien-Yien Li. Yorke was the first to use the term ‘chaos’ in his
paper, thereby defining the aperiodic linear system. In 1975, Robert May gave a
mathematical description to the species’ population change. He noticed that as periodic multiples continue in a chaos system, there are stable repetitions of stable cycles.
Consequently, he proved that there is an order among chaos.
Currently chaos is widely being studied in fields including non-linear circuits, fluid
and gas vibration, optics, vital signs such as pulse, brainwave and heartbeat, and economic phenomena such as stock market indices. There are also active development
efforts under way in computer engineering applications including neural networks,
pattern recognition, data compression, video processing, and optical systems[6,10].
Although scientists of related fields have exerted significant research efforts on the
chaos theory during its relatively short history, most development has been made in
theoretical aspects and not much in application areas. With the recent improvement of
computer processing capabilities and developments in academic theories of artificial
intelligence and application technologies, chaos theory has surfaced as a new area of
interest in the computer field. A computer can easily process a large amount of data
gathered in order to extract regularities from phenomena occurring in nature. The
rules of regularity are made into functions, values of which are utilized with the variation of time.

2.1 Attractor
The chaos phenomenon occurs in non-linear systems, but not all non-linear systems
render chaos phenomenon. Therefore, in order to apply the chaos theory, it is very
important to examine what dynamic systems yield chaos phenomenon. Whether chaos phenomenon or chaos solution exists can be generally verified by reconstructing
the attractor from the system data, acquiring the embedding dimension of the
reconstructed attractor, and performing examinations using this embedding dimension.
An attractor provides a visual display of state changes occurring with time in a dynamic system. It depicts the system state with a group of points or a line connecting
the points in a state space of n dimensions. In order to reconstruct an attractor, the
time delay and the embedding dimension are set, and the time series data are assigned
to each axis of the topological space as follows. Finally, starting from a certain point
X (1), a line links all points X (i) in the m-dimensional topological space in order[11].

Lecture Notes in Computer Science

X(1) = x(1), x(1+τ), x(1+2τ ), …. , x(1+(m-1)τ))
X(2) = x(2), x(2+τ), x(2+2τ), …. , x(2+(m-1)τ))
:
X(i) = x(i), x(i+τ), x(i+2τ), …. , x(i+(m-1)τ))

(1)

x represents a time series signal, X an m-dimension vector, m the embedding dimension, τ the time delay, and i the number of time series signals.
Theoretically, with a noiseless time series signal, setting the embedding dimension
m and time delay τ with random values does not change attractor characteristics.
However, in case of a signal with limited sampling, the reconstructed attractor shows
variations according to the selection of the embedding dimension and the time delay.
Embedding dimension is the attractor’s geometric dimension and it refers to the
number of variables in the object system. As the embedding dimension is mathematically increased, the attractor characteristics change, but when it reaches a certain
limit, changes no longer occur.

2.2 Logistic map
Natural phenomena repeat creation and modification according to consistent laws.
During a research based on Lorentz’s 3-dimensional non-linear simultaneous differential equations of first order, Tien-Yien Li and James Yorke found out that if we
focus on the movement of only one of the three variables, change in the maximum
value of the variable is created by one-dimensional phase[8].
Robert May used a simple equation for providing changes in the animal population
to announce specific research results based on the paper released by Li and Yorke[9].
Next year’s population = growth rate × (1-this year’s population)
× this year’s population

(2)

When modeling the species population, the state of the system is denoted with a
number between 0 and 1, 1 meaning the maximum number of the population and 0
total extinction.
From the term (1-this year’s population) of the equation, we can recognize that the
law of fluctuation in species population is non-linear. If the equation was simply ‘next
year’s population = growth rate × this year’s population’, we would see extreme results; for growth rates greater than 1, the population would increase indefinitely, and
the population would converge to 0 for growth rates less than 1. Therefore, by multiplying ‘growth rate × (1 - this year’s population)’, next year’s population is determined by this year’s number. This can be displayed with the following logistic equation. [5]
Xn+1 = α Xn (1-Xn)

(3)

α is the population growth rate, Xn this year’s population, and Xn+1 next year’s
population. From above logistics equation, the change from Xn to Xn+1 is called the
‘logistics map’. For a large α value, a small population grows rapidly, and a small α

Lecture Notes in Computer Science

signifies a rapidly declining population. These changes in population depend on the
value of the intermediate variable α.

3 New DES Encryption Algorithm
New DES Encryption Algorithm uses attractor reconstruction method instead of Sbox for function calculation, and Robert May’s logical second-order equation for
creating the key series. Two methods share a chaos characteristic of being sensitive to
initial conditions. This approach is proposed as an alternative for current encryption
algorithms with various problems.

3.1 Function used Attractor Reconstruction Method
The function is the process of converting the 64-bit Ri input and the 96-bit Ki+1 input
to 64-bit intermediate data using the chaos attractor reconstruction method. In order
to reconstruct the attractor, the embedding dimension m and the time delay τ must be
set beforehand. The number of time series signals becomes 64, which is the number
of bits for the output signal.
For this study, the embedding dimension m was randomly configured as 2. The
time delay τ was calculated by inputting Ki+1, using the hash compression method as
follows.
Apply hash compression method to the Ki+1 input and acquire a compressed 3-bit
text E.
According to the hash compressed 3-bit text E, configure the time delay τ as
shown in Table 1. Since the time series data Ki+1 and Rim have lengths of 96 bits, in
order to prevent the function outcome from repeating a same value, set τ with a number other than a multiple of 2 or 3, which are factors of 96.

Once the embedding dimension and the time delay are set, obtain time series data x
by repeatedly executing XOR to Rim and Ki+1, which were created in 96 bits
through expanded transposition of the key series Ri. The number of repetition for
configuring the time series data x is int(2τ/3) + 1.
Obtain the function value from the time series data x using the embedding dimension m and the time delay τ.
3.2 Key Creation

Lecture Notes in Computer Science

The chaos encryption system uses a 128-bit text string as the key, and the actual
length excluding the parity bits is 112 bits. The 112 bits are made into 96 bits using
compressed transposition, and the sub-key, which is input to the function calculation
using the logistic equation, calculates K1, K2, …., K16.
The value of α should be set greater than 3.8 for the equation outcome to have
chaos characteristics, and Kn should use an 8-bit ASCII value.

The process for encrypting the following sentence using the chaos encryption system
is as follows.

4. Analysis
Based on above execution outcome, an analysis of how characters were encrypted
according to key values is as follows. Statistical Analysis and Similarity Analysis
were utilized.

4.1 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis deals with how spellings used in plaintexts are displayed in encrypted texts. Encrypted texts may be deciphered from correlation not only among
individual spellings but also with adjacent spellings. Therefore, the statistical analysis
method must verify all of these conditions. Table 2 displays encryption results of
spellings with high frequency.

Looking at the table’s encryption outcome, we can see that one character generally
reveals diverse results. Padding especially yields different results even though a same
text string repeats itself. Below is the analysis of cases where different spellings give
an identical encryption result.
2 characters giving identical result: 5(a, s) and 40 other cases
3 characters giving identical result: 26(b, n, w) and 10 other cases
4 characters giving identical result: 0(c, h, r, v) and 2 other cases
For these cases, several characters give identical results, and it is difficult to decipher encrypted texts using spelling frequency. Although there were few cases where
identical spelling rendered identical outcome, ordering of adjacent text string came
out completely different as follows.
space (249) : it( )is <—> know( )about
i (240) : contr(i)butions <--> black (i)n dividuals
For English sentences, statistical techniques based on phrase analysis using relations with adjacent words are very common. However, above example eliminates the
possibility of deciphering encrypted texts through phrase analysis.
In the example carried out, there are three cases where an identical word was used.
Each case shows different results and security can be guaranteed against deciphering
techniques based on word analysis. Table 3 shows how the word ‘the’ was displayed
in the encrypted sentence.

4.2 Similarity Analysis
Similarity analysis determines the deciphering possibility according to the similarity
of the plaintext. It is advisable to design the outcome of the encrypted text according
to a single-bit change in plaintext so that the probability of each bit change is 1/2.
Table 4 displays the experiment outcome of the change in encrypted text according to

Lecture Notes in Computer Science

a single-bit change in plaintext. In order to simplify the notation of modification process, plaintexts are displayed in 16-base numbers. Plaintexts are divided into 8 bits,
and changes in encrypted texts are shown as each bit is modified.
According to the result displayed in the table, a single-bit change of plaintext
yields an average of 63.19-bit change of the encrypted text. This is close to the expected value of 64. Therefore, the encryption algorithm makes it practically difficult
to attempt deciphering based on plaintext similarity.

5. Conclusion and Research Direction
Encryption is expected to maintain its important role in the future information society. However, warnings from a number of scholars about existing methods raise
needs for a new encryption algorithm.
Chaos, with its characteristics that are sensitive to initial conditions, is surfacing as
an alternative to traditional encryption technologies, and many scientists are currently
conducting research activities for encryption application. However, despite active
research efforts in chaos application areas such as chaos encryption characteristic
analysis, there is yet to be satisfactory outcome.
This study has proposed an encryption scheme using chaos and provided an opportunity to become a step closer to chaos encryption by partially verifying security and
displaying that the encryption result of the process using the chaos approach yields
diverse characteristics. Reliability should be verified further through scientific and
diverse methods. Moreover, improvement of the transposition algorithm, modification of the embedding dimension of the attractor reconstruction method, and application of the α value to the logistic equation should provide solutions to current problems. In order to determine reliability in future research activities, I plan to apply
security verification techniques to potential weaknesses of existing algorithms such as
vulnerable key, similar vulnerable key, repetitious attack and trap door possibility.
