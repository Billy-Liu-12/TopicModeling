Introduction

A market is in equilibrium if there is no opportunity for risk-free, or low-risk, profit.

The majority of real markets, such as the stock market, are not in equilibrium thus

presenting the opportunity for transactions to take advantage of such risk-free, or lowrisk, profits.

Such transactions may be of an innovative, novel form.

The

The

project described here aims to to derive fundamental insight into how e-markets evolve.
To achieve this it addresses the problem of identifying timely information for e-markets
with their rapid, pervasive and massive flows of data.

This information is distilled

from individual signals in the markets themselves and from signals observed on the
unreliable, information-overloaded Internet.

Distributed, concurrent, time-constrained

data mining methods are managed using intelligent business process management

technology to extract timely, reliable information from this unreliable environment.
The perturbation of market equilibrium through entrepreneurial action is the essence of
market evolution.

Entrepreneurship relies both on intuition and information discovery.

The term ‘entrepreneur’ is used here in its technical sense [1].

An electronic market has been constructed in an on-going collaborative research project

The use of multiagent systems is justified

first by the distributed nature of e-business, and second by the critical nature of the
transactions involved.

The environment may be unreliable due to the unreliability of

the network and components in it, or due to the unreliability of players—for example, a
seller may simply renege on a deal.

Actor classes

For some while there has been optimism in the role of agents in electronic commerce.
“During this next-generation of agent-mediated electronic commerce,....

Agents will

strategically form and reform coalitions to bid on contracts and leverage economies of
scale......

It is in this third-generation of agent-mediated electronic commerce where

companies will be at their most agile and markets will approach perfect efficiency.”

[2].

There is a wealth of material, developed principally by micro-economists, on the
behaviour of rational economic agents.

The value of that work in describing the

behaviour of human agents is limited in part by the inability of humans to necessarily

behave in an (economically) rational way, particularly when their (computational)
resources

are

limited.

That

work

particularly well-suited to markets populated by software agents is now an established
area of research [4] [5].

Most electronic business to date has centred on on-line

exchanges in which a single issue, usually price, is negotiated through the application of
traditional auction-based market mechanisms.

Systems for multi-issue negotiation are

also being developed [6], also IBM’s Silkroad project [7].

The efficient management of

multi-issue negotiation towards a possible solution when new issues may be introduced
as the negotiation progresses remains a complex problem [8].

Given the optimism in the future of agents in electronic commerce and the body of

theoretical work describing the behaviour of rational agents, it is perhaps surprising that
the basic structure of the emerging e-business world is far from clear.

The majority of

Internet e-exchanges are floundering, and it appears that few will survive [9].

There are

indications that exchanges may even charge a negative commission to gain business and
so too market intelligence [op. cit.].

discussed in [28].

The rationale for negative commissions is

One reason for the recent failure of e-exchanges is that the process of

competitive bidding to obtain the lowest possible price is not compatible with the
development of buyer-seller relations.

The preoccupation with a single issue, namely

price, can overshadow other attributes such as quality, reliability, availability and
customisation.

A second reason for the failure Internet e-exchanges is that they deliver

little benefit to the seller—few suppliers want to engage in a ruthless bidding war [op.
cit.].

The future of electronic commerce must include the negotiation of complex

transactions and the development of long-term relationships between buyer and seller as
well as the e-exchanges.

Support for these complex transactions and relationships is

provided here by solution providers.

A considerable amount of work has been published on the comparative virtues of

open market e-exchanges and solution providers that facilitate direct negotiation.

For

example, [10] argues that for privately informed traders the ‘weak’ trader types will
systematically migrate from direct negotiations to competitive open markets.

Also, for

Those results

are derived in a supply/demand-bounded world into which signals may flow.

These

signals may be received by one or more of the agents in that world, and so may cause
those agents to revise their valuation of the matter at hand.

The e-market

The construction of experimental e-markets is an active area of research.
[12] describes work done at IBM’s Institute for Advanced Commerce.

For example,

There are two

functional components in the basic e-market: the e-exchange and a solution provider.

The solution provider is ‘minimal’ and simply provides a conduit between buyer and
seller through which long term contracts are negotiated.

The solution provider in its

present form does not give third-party support to the negotiation process.
An e-exchange is created for a fixed duration.

An e-exchange is a virtual space in

which a variety of market-type activities can take place at specified times.

determined by the e-exchange clock.

The time is

Each activity is advertised on a notice board which

shows the start and stop time for that activity as well as what the activity is and the
regulations that apply to players who wish to participate in it.

The user agents may be ‘dumb’, or ‘smart’ being

programmed by the user to make decisions.

Each activity has an activity manager that

ensures that the regulations of that activity are complied with.

These rules are enforced by an e - e x c h a n g e

For example, can any player create a sale activity (which could be some sort

of auction), or, can any player enter the e-exchange by offering some service, such as
advice on what to buy, or by offering ‘package deals’ of goods derived from different
suppliers?

A high-level view of the e-market is shown in Fig. 1.

For example, see optimal

One important feature of a mechanism is the ‘optimal’ strategy that a

player should use, and whether that strategy is “truth revealing” [11].

The actors’ assistant

In ‘real’ problems, a decision to use an e-exchange or a solution provider will be made
on the basis of general knowledge that is external to the e-market place.

Having decided

to use either an e-exchange or a solution provider, the negotiation strategy used will also
depend on general knowledge.

Such general knowledge will typically be broadly based

and beyond the capacity of modern AI systems whilst remaining within reasonable cost
bounds.

E-markets reside on the Internet alongside the vast resources of the World Wide

Web.

In the experiments described here, the general knowledge available is restricted to

that which can be gleaned from the e-markets themselves and that which can be extracted
from the Internet in general—including the World Wide Web.

A new

generation of data analysis and supporting techniques—collectively labelled as data

mining methods—are now applied to stock market analysis, predictions and other
financial and market analysis applications [13].

The application of data mining methods

in e-business to date has predominantly been within the B2C framework, where data is
mined at an on-line business site, resulting in the derivation of various behavioural
metrics of site visitors and customers.

The basic steps in providing assistance to actors in this project are:

•

identifying potentially relevant signals;

•

estimating the significance of those signals to the matter at hand;

•
•
•

evaluating the reliability of those signals;

combining a (possibly large) number of signals into coherent advice, and
providing digestible explanations for the advice given.

For example, the identification of potentially relevant signals includes scanning news
feeds.

have changed; they may be used to trigger a detailed search of other pages.

The estimation of the significance of a signal to a matter at hand is complicated by

the fact that one person may place more faith in the relevance of a particular signal than
others.

So this estimation can only be performed on a personal basis.

This work does

not, for example, attempt to use a signal to predict whether the US dollar will rise
against the UK pound.

What it does attempt to do is to predict the value that an actor

will place on a signal [14].

So the feedback here is provided by the user in the form of

A five point scale runs from ‘totally useless’ to ‘very

Having identified the signals that a user has faith in, “classical” data mining

methods [15] are then applied to combine these signals into succinct advice again using
a five point scale.

This feedback is used to ‘tweak’ the weights in Bayesian networks

and as feedback to neural networks [16].

Bayesian networks are preferred when some

confidence can be placed in a set of initial values for the weights.

Process management

Fig 1. may give the false impression that all the process management system does is to
support communication between the user agents and their corresponding proxy agents.

All transactions are managed as business processes, including a simple ‘buy order’, and

It also manages goal-directed processes in a fairly conventional way

using single-entry quadruple-exit plans that give almost-failure-proof operation.

managing the operation of the system described in Sec. 2.

Deliberative reasoning is effected by the non-deterministic procedure: “on the basis

of current beliefs—identify the current options, on the basis of current options and

existing commitments—select the current commitments (called the agent’s goals or

desires), for each newly-committed goal choose a plan for that goal, from the selected
plans choose a consistent set of things to do next (called the agent’s intentions)”.

A

plan for a goal is a conditional sequence of sub-goals that may include iterative or
recursive structures.

If the current options do not include a current commitment then

that commitment is dropped.

In outline, the reactive reasoning mechanism employs

triggers that observe the agent’s beliefs and are ‘hot wired’ back to the procedural
intentions.

If those triggers fire then they take precedence over the agent’s deliberative

reasoning.

✓ ), failure (✗ ) ,

So this leads to each plan having four possible exits: success (

and unknown (

In practice these four exists do not necessarily have to

lead to different sub-goals, and so the growth in the size of plan with depth is not quite
as bad as could be expected.

KQML (Knowledge Query and M anipulation Language) is used for inter-agent

communication [27].

Each process agent has a message area.

If agent A wishes to tell

something to agent B then it does so by posting a message to agent B’s message area.
Each agent has a message manager whose role is to look after that agent’s message area.

Each message contains an instruction for the message manager.

The first step in the design process for a multi-agent system is determining the

system organisation.

In the application described here, the system organisation consists

of one process agent for each (human) user.

There are no other agents in the system.

Conclusion

One of the innovations in this project is the development of a coherent environment for

e-market places, a comprehensive set of actor classes and the use of a powerful
multiagent process management system to make the whole thing work.

The use of a

powerful business process management system to drive all the electronic market
transactions unifies the whole market operation.

The development of computational

models of the basic market transactions, deploying those models in the e-market place,

and including them as part of the building blocks for creating a complete e-market place
provides a practical instrument for continued research and development in electronic
markets.
