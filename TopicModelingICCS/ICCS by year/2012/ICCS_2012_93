Sequential static-dynamic hedging for long-term derivatives
Tim Leung
IEOR Department, Columbia University

Abstract
This paper presents a new methodology for hedging long-term ﬁnancial derivatives written on an illiquid asset.
The proposed hedging strategy combines dynamic trading of a correlated liquid asset (e.g. the market index) and static
positions in market-traded options such as European puts and calls. Moreover, since most market-traded options are
relatively short-term, it is necessary to conduct the static hedge sequentially over time till the long-term derivative
expires. This sequential static-dynamic hedging strategy leads to the study of a stochastic control problem and the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs and variational inequalities. A series of transformations allow us to simplify
the problem and compute the optimal hedging strategy.

1. Introduction
In the standard no-arbitrage pricing theory, option positions are assumed to be hedged perfectly by continuously
trading the underlying asset. The option price is computed from the conditional expectation of discounted payoﬀ under
a unique risk-neutral pricing measure. However, in many ﬁnancial applications, the underlying asset is non-traded.
Some examples include weather derivatives [1], employee stock options [2, 3, 4], options on illiquid assets [5, 6].
Instead, derivatives holders manage their risk exposure by trading some liquid assets correlated with the underlying.
One candidate hedging instrument is the market index, whose liquidity and relatively low transaction cost permit
dynamic trading. Also, standard market-traded options can be used as additional hedging instruments. However, high
transaction costs discourage frequent option trades, so recent work (for example [7], [8], and [9]) has focused on static
hedging with options, which involves purchasing a portfolio of standard options at initiation and no trades afterwards.
This paper presents a new methodology for hedging long-term options written on a non-traded asset. Speciﬁcally,
the hedging strategy proposed herein combines dynamic trading of a correlated liquid asset (e.g. the market index)
and static positions in market-traded options. Moreover, since most market-traded options are relatively short-term,
it is sensible to conduct static hedging sequentially over time till the long-term option expires. For this reason, the
proposed strategy is called sequential static-dynamic hedging.

The sequential static-dynamic hedging mechanism is applicable to both European and American options. One
practical ﬁnancial example is the hedging of employee stock options (ESOs). ESOs considered here are European
or American options written on the ﬁrm’s stock. The ESO holder (employee) cannot trade the ﬁrm’s stock. Instead,
he/she dynamically invests in the market index, and buy-and-hold market-traded put options over time. Since the
market is incomplete, we will adopt a utility maximization approach to determine the optimal static positions at
diﬀerent times, along with the optimal dynamic trading strategy.
2. Model Formulation
The ﬁnancial market consists of a riskless bank account, a market index S , and the ﬁrm’s stock Y. The prices of S
and Y are modeled as lognormal processes
(traded)

.
η

The ESO is a call option written on the ﬁrm’s stock with ﬁnite maturity T . We shall consider European ESOs and
American ESOs separately in Sections 3 and 4 respectively.
The employee cannot trade the ﬁrm’s stock but dynamically invests in the market index S and the bank account to
partially hedge his position. With a dynamic investment strategy θ, the employee’s trading wealth evolves according
to the process
(1)
dXuθ = [θu (μ − r) + rXu ] du + θu σ dBu , Xt = x ,
where θ represents the cash amount invested in S . The set of all admissible strategies, Θ, consists of all self-ﬁnancing
T
Ft -progressively measurable processes (θt )t≥0 such that the integrability condition IE { 0 θt2 dt } < ∞. For 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤
T , we denote by Θ s,t the set of admissible strategies over the period [s, t].
In addition to dynamic trading, the employee also purchases from the market some put options written on the
ﬁrm’s stock. For the moment, let us consider only European puts all with the same strike K , though in reality there is
a wide array of options to choose from, and the choices can be path dependent1 . To avoid arbitrage opportunities, we
assume that the market price of the market-traded puts lie within the no-arbitrage bounds. Since the underlying asset
Y follows a geometric Brownian motion, it makes sense to set the market price to be the Black-Scholes put option
price, denoted by π(t, y).
After every purchase, the employee will hold the put options till expiration. Typically the market-traded options
have short maturities, so the employee will repeat this buy-and-hold strategy several times till the ESO expires. To
this end, let the maturity of the market-traded puts be Δt = T/N where N is some positive integer. Denote tn = nΔt,
for n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1. Therefore, the employee make option purchases at times {0, t1 , t2 , . . . , tN−1 }.
The market is incomplete, so we adopt a utility maximization approach to determine the optimal hedges. In
particular, we represent the employee’s risk preference by an exponential utility function
U(x) = −e−γx ,

x ∈ R,

with a constant absolute risk aversion γ > 0. We interpret U(x) as the employee’s utility of having wealth $x time T .
1 For

example, the strike can be a Ft -measurable random variable, such as g(Yt ), instead of a constant K .

3. Sequential Static-Dynamic Hedging for European ESOs
In this section, we discuss the static-dynamic hedging of a European ESO with payoﬀ C(YT ) = (YT − K)+ . We
shall deﬁne the ESO holder’s value function recursively backward in time. To start with, suppose at time tN−1 , the
employee is holding an ESO, along with bN−1 units of put options which will expire at time T with payoﬀ bN−1 D(YT ) =
bN−1 (K − YT )+ . Therefore, the employee’s value function at time tN−1 is given by
V (N−1) (tN−1 , x, y; bN−1 )
= sup IE U (XT + C(YT ) + bN−1 D(YT )) | XtN−1 = x, YtN−1 = y .
θtN−1 ,T

(2)

Now, accounting for the market price π of the puts at time tN−1 , the employee chooses bN−1 so as to maximize the
value function:
(3)
b∗N−1 (x, y) = arg max V (N−1) (tN−1 , x − bπ(tN−1 , y), y ; b) .
0≤b<∞

For convenience, we write the value function and indiﬀerence price corresponding to this optimal static hedge as
V∗(N−1) (tN−1 , x, y) = V (N−1) tN−1 , x − b∗N−1 π(tN−1 , y), y; b∗N−1 ,
p(N−1)
(tN−1 , y) = p(N−1) (tN−1 , x, y; b∗N−1 ) − b∗N−1 π(tN−1 , y).
∗

(4)
(5)

It is often better for intuitive purposes to work with indiﬀerence prices, which we will deﬁne next. To do so,
we ﬁrst consider the investment problem in which the risk-averse employee dynamically trades in the market index
and bank account without any options till T . This well-studied problem is ﬁrst introduced by [10]. The employee’s
maximal expected utility, called the Merton function, is given by
M(t, x) = sup IE {U(XT ) | Xt = x}
θt,T

= −e−γxr

(T −t)

λ2

e− 2 (T −t) .

At anytime t ∈ [tn , tn+1 ), the employee’s indiﬀerence price p(n) (t, x, y; bn ) for holding the ESO and bn puts is deﬁned
by the equation
(6)
V (n) (t, x, y; bn ) = M t, x + p(n) (t, x, y; bn ) ,
where V (n) (t, x, y; bn ) is the value function for time interval [tn , tn+1 ) (to be deﬁned in (10)). This deﬁning equation
allows us to express the optimal static position b∗n in (3) in terms of the indiﬀerence price.
b∗n (x, y) = arg max p(n) (tn , x, y; b) − bπ(tn , y).

(7)

0≤b<∞

Therefore, the optimal static position is found from the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the employees indiﬀerence
price as a function of the number of puts, evaluated at the market price. As in (4) and (5), we denote the value
function and indiﬀerence price corresponding to this optimal static hedge by
V∗(n) (t, x, y) = V (n) t, x − b∗n π(t, y), y; b∗n ,
p(n)
∗ (t, y)

= p(n) (t, x, y; b∗n ) − b∗n π(t, y).

(9)

Starting with the value function V (N−1) , we move backward in time to derive the value functions V (N−2) , V (N−3) ,
. . . , V (0) . Indeed, the employee’s value function at time t ∈ [tn , tn+1 ), for n = N − 2, N − 3, . . . , 0, is given by
V (n) (t, x, y ; bn )
= sup IE V∗(n+1) (tn+1 , Xtn+1 + bn D(Ytn+1 ), Ytn+1 ) | Xt = x, Yt = y

3.1. A Recursive System of PDEs
The value functions {V (N−1) , V (N−2) , . . . , V (0) } lead us to study a system of PDEs. To do so, let us introduce the

The operator L is the inﬁnitesimal generator of (X, Y), LE is the inﬁnitesimal generator of Y under the minimal
entropy martingale measure, QE , and the last operator Aql is quasilinear.
First, the value function V (N−1) (t, x, y; b) is conjectured to solve the following HJB PDE
Vt(N−1) + sup LV (N−1) = 0 ,

for (t, x, y) ∈ [tN−1 , T ) × R × (0, +∞). The boundary conditions are

Due to the exponential utility function, the value function has a separation of variables (see [5]):

V (N−1) (t, x, y; b) = M(t, x) · H (N−1) (t, y; b) (1−ρ2 ) .
The function H (N−1) solves a linear PDE

.

By the deﬁnition of indiﬀerence price, this function H (N−1) is connected to the indiﬀerence price p(N−1) in the
following way:
1
p(N−1) (t, y; b) = −
log H (N−1) (t, y; b) , t ∈ [tN−1 , T ].
(12)
γ(1 − ρ2 )er(T −t)
which gives

(13)

and the following PDE
Aql p(N−1) = 0,

(14)

with boundary conditions
p(N−1) (T, y; b) = C(y) + bD(y),

and

p(N−1) (t, 0; b) = bKe−r(T −t) .

In practice, we numerically solve the PDE for H (N−1) (t, y; b) and use (12) to derive the indiﬀerence price p(N−1) (t, y; b).
Then, we optimize over b (as in (7)) to obtain the employee’s optimal static hedges b∗N−1 at time tN−1 , along with the
corresponding V∗(N−1) (t, x, y), H∗(N−1) (t, y) and p(N−1)
(t, y), which will appear in the terminal conditions for V (N−2) (t, x, y; b).
∗
All these allow us to iterate backward to derive the PDEs for V (n) (t, x, y; b) and p(n) (t, y; b) for n = N − 2, N − 3, . . . , 0.
To be precise, at time t ∈ [tn , tn+1 ), the value function V (n) (t, x, y; b) satisﬁes the HJB PDE

4. Sequential Static-Dynamic Hedging for American ESOs
In this section, we investigate the squential hedging problem for an American ESO. Our ultimate objectives are to
analyze the optimal static positions over time, and examine the nontrivial eﬀect of static hedges on the optimal ESO
exercising strategy. We denote by T the set of all stopping times with respect to F taking values in [0, T ]. This will
be the collection of all admissible exercise times for the ESO. For s, u ∈ T with s ≤ u, we denote the set of stopping
times in between by T s,u := {τ ∈ T : s ≤ τ ≤ u}.
We assume that the employee will reinvest the ESO proceeds, if any, into the dynamic trading portfolio. Moreover,
after the ESO exercise, there is no need for future static hedges, so the sequential static hedging will terminate by the
next expiration date. Precisely, if the ESO has been exercised at time t ∈ (tn , tn+1 ], n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}, then the
employee, who still holds some a units of European puts expiring at tn+1 , faces the investment problem
u(n) (t, x, y; a) = sup IE {M(tn+1 , Xtn+1 + aD(Ytn+1 )) | Xt = x, Yt = y}.
θt,tn+1

(17)

This is a standard utility maximization problem with European puts. We can express it in terms of the indiﬀerence
price for the puts, denoted by h(n) (t, y; a):
u(n) (t, x, y; a) = M(t, x + h(n) (t, y; a)).
Now suppose the employee is holding the American ESO at tN−1 , along with aN−1 units of put options. Then, the
value function is given by
Vˆ (N−1) (tN−1 , x, y; aN−1 )
= sup

sup IE M τ, Xτ + C(Yτ ) + h(N−1) (τ, Yτ ; aN−1 ) | XtN−1 = x, YtN−1 = y .

τ∈TtN−1 ,T θtN−1 ,T

(18)

1216

Tim Leung / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1211 – 1218

Now, accounting for the market price π of the puts at time tN−1 , the employee chooses aN−1 so as to maximize the
value function:
(19)
a∗N−1 (x, y) = arg max Vˆ (N−1) (tN−1 , x − aπ(tN−1 , y), y ; a) .
0≤a<∞

For any time t ∈ [tn , tn+1 ), the employee’s indiﬀerence price pˆ (n) (t, x, y; an ) for holding the American ESO and an
puts is deﬁned by the equation
(20)
Vˆ (n) (t, x, y; an ) = M t, x + pˆ (n) (t, x, y; an ) ,
where Vˆ (n) (t, x, y; an ) is deﬁned in (24) below. We can express the optimal static position a∗n (decided at time tn ) in
terms of the indiﬀerence price and market price.
a∗n (x, y) = arg max pˆ (n) (tn , x, y; a) − aπ(tn , y).

(21)

0≤a<∞

We write the value function and indiﬀerence price with this optimal static hedge as
Vˆ ∗(n) (t, x, y) = Vˆ (n) t, x − a∗n π(t, y), y; a∗n ,
pˆ (n)

(23)

Then, for n ∈ {N − 2, N − 3, . . . , 0}, the employee’s value function at time t ∈ [tn , tn+1 ) with an put options is given
recursively by
Vˆ (n) (t,x, y ; an )

where u(n) is deﬁned in (17).
4.1. A Recursive System of Free Boundary Problems
We proceed to derive the variational inequalities for {Vˆ (N−1) , Vˆ (N−2) , . . . , Vˆ (0) }, which will lead to a system of free
boundary problems for the corresponding indiﬀerence prices.
We ﬁrst consider the variational inequality for Vˆ (N−1) (t, x, y; a).
Vˆ t(N−1) + sup LVˆ (N−1) ≤ 0,
θ

Vˆ (N−1) ≥ M t, x + C(y) + h(N−1) (t, y; a) ,

and

Similar to Section 3.1, we numerically solve the free boundary problem for Hˆ (N−1) (t, y; a) and use (38) to derive
the indiﬀerence price pˆ (N−1) (t, y; a). Then, we optimize over a to obtain the employee’s optimal static hedges a∗N−1
at time tN−1 , along with the corresponding Vˆ ∗(N−1) (t, x, y) and pˆ (N−1)
(t, y) which will become the terminal conditions

5. Conclusions and Extensions
In summary, we have discussed a new utility-based methodology for hedging long-term ﬁnancial derivatives. The
hedging strategy involves dynamic trading of a correlated liquid asset (e.g. the market index) combined with static
positions in market-traded options. In view of the relatively short maturities of most liquid market-traded options, we
revise the static hedges sequentially over time till the long-term derivative expires. In order to analyze the optimal
sequential static-dynamic hedging strategy, we study the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs and variational
inequalities. Working with exponential utility, we apply a series of transformations that reduce the problem for
tractability. For future investigation, one meaningful extension is to allow to roll over the short-term positions at
random times, rather than a ﬁxed schedule. The rolling decisions will lead to an optimal multiple stopping problem.
This is also related to the optimal timing to purchase options [11, 12]
