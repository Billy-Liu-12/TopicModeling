Abstract
Field Alignment is a useful and often necessary preprocessing step in contemporary geophysical state and parameter estimation of coherent structures. In an advance, we introduce a new framework for using Field Alignment to
quantify uncertainty from an ensemble of coherent structures. Our method, called Coalescence, discovers the mean
Ô¨Åeld under non-trivial misalignments of Ô¨Åelds with complex shapes, which is especially diÔ¨Écult to calculate in the
presence of sparse observations. We solve the associated Field Alignment problem using novel constraints derived
from turbulent displacement spectra. In conjunction with a continuation method called Scale Cascaded Alignment
(SCA), we are able to extract simpler explanations of the error between Ô¨Åelds before cascading to more complex deformation solutions. For coherent structures, SCA and Coalescence have the potential to change the way uncertainty
is quantiÔ¨Åed and data is assimilated. We illustrate utility here in a Nowcasting application.

1. Introduction
Environmental data assimilation is the methodology for combining imperfect model predictions with uncertain
data in a way that acknowledges their respective uncertainties. It plays a fundamental role in DDDAS as the mechanism by which environmental models are updated. However, data assimilation can only work when the estimation
process properly represents all sources of error. The diÔ¨Éculties created by improperly represented errors are particularly apparent in mesoscale meteorological phenomena such as thunderstorms, squall-lines, wild Ô¨Åres, hurricanes,
precipitation, and fronts. They also show up elsewhere, for example in reservoir applications where permeability
Ô¨Åelds have strong contrast.
Errors in mesoscale models can arise in many ways but they often manifest themselves as errors in position. We
typically cannot attribute position error to a single source and it is likely that they are the aggregate result of errors

in parameter values, initial conditions, boundary conditions and others. In the context of cyclones, operational forecasters resort to ad hoc procedures such as bogussing [1]. A more sophisticated alternative is to use data assimilation
methods. Unfortunately, sequential [2], ensemble-based [3] and variational [4] state estimation methods used in data
assimilation applications adjust amplitudes to deal with position error. Adjusting amplitudes does not really Ô¨Åx position error, and can produce unacceptably distorted estimates instead. As seen in Figure 1, showing a simulated ‚Äúone
dimensional front,‚Äù the true signal (dashed line) observed sparsely (blue dots) by a noisy sensor produces a reasonable
estimate (red) from an initial guess (green) when the position error is negligible. It causes disaster (right image) when
the error is relatively larger.

Figure 1: Estimation with ‚Äú3DVAR‚Äù or ensemble methods works well when position errors are small (left). The analysis can be seriously distorted
when these errors are large (right).

Indeed, a growing number of researchers are pointing to the role that position errors play in spatial estimation [5,
6, 7]. The issue captured by Figure 1 appears to occur irrespective of the nature of the contemporary estimation
procedure used. Solutions have also been proposed, most notably as an optimization problem expressed in the space of
grid positions and Ô¨Åeld amplitudes, with suitable constraints on the grid deformation (or pixel displacement) [8, 5, 9].
Rather than just adjusting amplitudes, this is a more general way of minimizing misÔ¨Åt between two spatial Ô¨Åelds. Not
surprisingly, it can be applied to many geophysical, meteorological and oceanographic problems [8, 10, 11, 5, 12, 13,
14, 15, 9]. In Section 2, we will summarize the advances.

Figure 2: Smoothness constraint in alignment formulations is common practice. In the top row, a template (left image) is being aligned to the target
(right image), which is a rotated and translated version. The iterations of the optimization produce a complex deformation sequence. Below, SCA,
a new proposed method, automatically recovers the dominant modes of deformation by seeking the simplest explanation of the deformation Ô¨Årst.

However, there are many outstanding issues. This paper will focus on two, progressing from previous DDDAS

work [8]. The Ô¨Årst issue concerns the appropriateness of constraints on grid deformation. Most methods rely on
smoothness constraints or parameterizations such as splines. Such methods are limited because even as they display
remarkable capabilities at ‚Äúmorphing‚Äù one pattern into another, such invariance comes at the cost of selectivity. That
is, the more complex a dissimilarity in shape between Ô¨Åelds that an algorithm can undo, the more diÔ¨Écult it is to
control the deformation solutions produced. In Figure 2, for example, we see that a ‚Äúcross‚Äù is merely translated and
rotated (see Ô¨Årst and Ô¨Åfth columns). However, snapshots of the deformation solution with smoothness constraints (top
row) depicts a complex ‚Äúviscous‚Äù motion. This is not surprising but it is not appropriate either. How might we trust
such a method when observations are sparse? We propose a new method, Scale Cascaded Alignment (SCA) [9, 11, 10],
that returns the simplest possible ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù (see bottom row). The improved control of the deformation solution
(selectivity) without loss of a ‚Äúmorphing‚Äù ability (invariance) will, as we shall see, turn out to be a key beneÔ¨Åt. SCA
is discussed in Section 3.

Figure 3: An ensemble of one-dimensional fronts on the left with position and amplitude errors. The ensemble mean is an inappropriate mean
Ô¨Åeld, producing a smeared bimodal front that loses the frontal shape. We introduce a method called Coalescence, which calculates the mean by
marginalizing relative position errors in the ensemble (right).

The second issue considered is uncertainty quantiÔ¨Åcation for coherent structures where SCA plays a key part.
Consider, as an illustration, an ensemble of ‚Äúone dimensional‚Äù fronts that contain position and amplitude errors, as
shown in Figure 3 (left). If we were to ask what the mean front is, clearly the simplest solution is to take the mean of
these Ô¨Åelds, that is, calculate the mean vector. That would be terribly wrong, of course, because the mean simply does
not look like any front in the ensemble. It would be terrible, for example, if the mean of an ensemble of hurricane
Ô¨Åelds produced a mean Ô¨Åeld with multiple vortices! The solution to this problem is not trivial, but is a fundamental
step when quantifying uncertainty by moments.
We introduce a technique called Coalescence, wherein the mean amplitude Ô¨Åeld is calculated by marginalizing
relative position errors. The method invokes an ‚ÄúN-body‚Äù type solution where each member in the ensemble gravitates
to the others. In so doing, all of them discover a mean position where the amplitude mean is meaningful. This
technique is an extension of a preliminary approach to this problem [12] and we should note its validity in the presence
of complex misalignments, structural shape variability and sparsity. Coalescence is discussed in Section 4.
A large number of applications beneÔ¨Åt from these new developments including data assimilation [5], veriÔ¨Åcation [7], reservoir modeling, pattern recognition [9], and velocimetry [11, 10]. We will present storm tracking in
Section 5.
2. Methodology
Let us consider a gridded scalar Ô¨Åeld X, and a deformation Ô¨Åeld (or displacement Ô¨Åeld) q, which is a vector Ô¨Åeld,
and X ‚ó¶ q as the deformation of X by q, as shown in Figure 4. We think about a second Ô¨Åeld Y, which may be gridded

q

X

X(r ‚Äì q(r))

Figure 4: A gridded Ô¨Åeld X is deformed by applying a displacement vector Ô¨Åeld q to its coordinates r

or not, and related to the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åeld by the observation operator h. From a suitable Bayesian formulation, one may
synthesize the following objective [5, 9]:
J(X, q) = X ‚àí X f ‚ó¶ q

T

B(X f ‚ó¶ q)‚àí1 X ‚àí X f ‚ó¶ q + Y ‚àí h(X f ‚ó¶ q)

T

R‚àí1 Y ‚àí h(X f ‚ó¶ q) + Œõ(q)

(1)

The term B in (1) is the background error covariance, q is the displacement Ô¨Åeld, X f the forecast, and h(¬∑) the
observation operator and Œõ the constraints on displacement. Like a pixel-wise amplitude error, the displacement or
deformation vector Ô¨Åeld q is deÔ¨Åned at every grid coordinate. Note that (1) can be trivially extended to use an ensemble
S
by writing Je (X, q) = s J(X s , q s ), with B B( X sf ‚ó¶ q s
) also being derived from the S -member ensemble.
s=1
If we assume that the forecast distribution is perfect without position errors and suitably Gaussian, then it is trivial
to see (via a Taylor expansion of (1)) that non-zero position errors inÔ¨Çate the forecast error (amplitude) covariance.
Although non-Gaussian amplitude errors may result from position errors, we show that the covariance is always weakened (for non-zero displacements) and this is the principal problem plaguing eÔ¨Äective estimation [5]. The corrupted
amplitude covariance, especially when it is Ô¨Çow-dependent, can no longer achieve the Cramer-Rao bound that was
achieved in a world without position errors.
Error between spatial Ô¨Åelds are quantiÔ¨Åed and reduced in position and amplitude subspaces in (1) without explicit
detection of feature positions. However, if feature positions are available, they can be easily incorporated as boundary
conditions. Because feature positions need not explicitly be speciÔ¨Åed, situations where sparse observations are present
or feature positions are diÔ¨Écult to specify (e.g. fronts, complex storm shapes) can be directly addressed. Because the
deformation solution is dense, non-trivial alignments can be easily represented (as opposed to a strictly Lagrangian
approach), including local skews, shears, rotations, divergence, convergence and higher modes [5].
The error between spatial Ô¨Åelds can be jointly reduced in position and amplitude subspaces optimally if and only if
the sensitivity of the amplitude error covariance to position errors is accounted, because B is dependent on q [5]. This
is a non-trivial problem except when (a) the amplitude error covariance is assumed to be static or (b) when position
and amplitude errors are assumed to be independent or (c) jointly Gaussian. These assumptions will produce poor
results when reality does not match them (which is almost always), but they are what have been assumed in earlier
work [7, 6]. We do not make such an assumption and were the Ô¨Årst to show, instead, that the joint error-reduction
problem can be solved using sampling (ensemble) methods [5].
We were also the Ô¨Årst to show that the error between spatial Ô¨Åelds can be reduced in position and amplitude
in two steps in a systematic way (though ad-hoc approaches were considered contemporarily), that is they arise by
considering the Euler-Lagrange equations of (1) [8, 5]. This approximation yields two numerical processes: a Field
Alignment process and an amplitude adjustment process, the latter being familiar as contemporary data assimilation
(in 3D). The Field Alignment process becomes a pre-processor, which makes practical application feasible and with
broad utility [8, 5].

1191

The Euler-Lagrange equations can be written as follows. First equation, which is iterated in deformation is:
H T R‚àí1 (Y ‚àí Xif )
Li qi

Zi
qÀú i
qÀú i [k] =

‚àáXif T [k] Zi [k] = fi [k]

(2)

H is the Jacobian of the observation operator, and qi is the instantaneous displacement in the i iteration, Li qi =
f
‚ó¶ qi‚àí1 . Note that (2) is evaluated for each component of qÀú i ‚Äôs vector space at
dŒõ/dqi , X0f = X f , q0 = 0 and Xif = Xi‚àí1
pixel or grid point k. The second equation, in amplitude, may be written as:
th

X a = X‚àóf + B‚àó H T (HB‚àó H T + R)‚àí1 (Y ‚àí X‚àóf )
X‚àóf

(3)
Xif

‚â° X ‚ó¶ ( i qi ) is the Ô¨Ånal deformed Ô¨Årst guess, which may in practice be obtained via the iteration:
=
f
a
‚ó¶ qi‚àí1 . B‚àó = B(X‚àó ) is the Ô¨Ånal covariance, and X is a ‚Äúquadratic update‚Äù familiar as OI/3DVAR/KF/EKF/EnKF.
Note that (2) and (3) are approximations to a direct solution.
Dynamical Balance is better preserved when data is assimilated by Ô¨Åeld alignment and the technique deÔ¨Åned
by (2) is easily extended to multivariate Ô¨Åelds and vector Ô¨Åelds [8, 5]. However, constraints must be imposed on the
nature of the deformation. We showed that constraints on the displacement Ô¨Åeld can be simple ‚ÄúÔ¨Çuid-like‚Äù ones, such
as smoothness and non-divergence, see (4), but they need to be speciÔ¨Åed at an appropriate length scale to be eÔ¨Äective,
which is often unknown. Otherwise, they produce an inappropriate, aliased explanation of the true deformation. In
contrast, we posit that by seeking the simplest explanation [9, 11], simplicity being deÔ¨Åned by the smallest spatial wave
number (or scale) a deformation is restricted to, useful and robust solutions can be produced. By cascading through
deformation scales (from translation to ‚Äúturbulence‚Äù), dominant modes of misalignment can also be estimated. We
call this Scale Cascaded Alignment (SCA), discussed next.

3. Scale Cascaded Alignment
With smoothness, and non-divergence, two popular constraints of the Tikhonov type, the iterated alignment equation (2) reduces to:
(4)
w1 ‚àá2 qi + w2 ‚àá(‚àá ¬∑ qi ) ‚àí fi = 0
In what follows, we drop the explicit notation for iteration i and use q to denote the instantaneous displacement.
Let us suppose a vector Ô¨Åeld q(p) (q x (p), qy (p))T with a Fourier transform pair Q(œâ) = (Q x (œâ), Qy (œâ))T . Similarly,
let f ‚Üî F be a transform pair. We can then write a solution to (4) in wave-number space (m 0 and n 0) of the
form:
Qx
Qy

=

Ha
Hb

Hb
Hc

Fx
Fy

(5)

For the sake of simplicity, let us set w2 = 0, which leads to Laplace-Beltrami Ô¨Çow (but the problem obviously remains
regularized). The resulting Ô¨Ålter is the Fourier Transform of the Laplacian (Bi-Laplacian is also commonly used),
which prescribes a power-law spectrum for the instantaneous deformation.
H = Ha = Hc = ‚àí

1
w1 ||œâ||22

(6)

The displacement spectrum Q is capable of producing complex deformations because the Ô¨Ålter H admits high
frequencies. It is capable of aliasing a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù cause into a complex explanation, as shown in Figure 2. To control
the deformation better, we propose the following three steps:
1. Laplace Approximation of Power Law. In the viscous formulation, w1 only controls the convergence rate
(provided stability is maintained) but not the deformation spectrum. The shape of the Ô¨Ålter can be controlled
by changing the power law itself, but here we propose a Laplace ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù as an approximation: e(r) =
2
Œ≤e‚àí|r|/2Œ± , where r is the spectral radius. This formulation overcomes the singularity in the power law and it
can reasonably approximate any power law using the parameters Œ≤ (gain) and Œ± (bandwidth), thus producing
instantaneous displacements ranging from translations to turbulence. A comparison of the original Ô¨Ålter and the
tunable approximation is shown in Figure 5(a) for a power-law of 2 (smoothness).

Figure 5: Smoothness, which yields a power-law, can be approximated by the parameterized Laplace distribution, which may in turn be expressed
by a Gabor basis. The resulting algorithm, SCA, performs substantially better.

2. Gabor Ô¨Ålter basis for deformations. The deformation spectrum is expressed using a Gabor basis (see Figure 5(b)
and Figure 5(c) in 1D and 2D respectively). Thus, we may write the Ô¨Ålter as a weighted sum of the basis:
H i Œæi

H=

(7)

i

The Ô¨Ålter Hi is the sum of all Ô¨Ålters at a common radius around the spectrum.
3. Scale Cascaded Alignment (SCA). We solve for the total displacement in sequence, starting with Ô¨Ålters closest
to the origin (DC or translation) and moving higher to more complex wavenumbers. Thus we may iterate with
index j as Q j = Hi F j before continuing to a Ô¨Åner solution using Hi+1 and so on, until all the Ô¨Ålters organized
according to their ‚Äúspectral radius‚Äù are exhausted. In general, Ô¨Ålter at wave number 0 is translation, at wavenumber 21 accounts for global deformations, and at the highest wavenumber, total turbulence. Displacement Ô¨Åelds
corresponding to each Ô¨Ålter-bank are returned and their sum is the total displacement that minimizes the model
data misÔ¨Åt in position space.
SCA can be implemented as an independent Euler-Lagrange equation, or as a gradient functional in a joint
position-amplitude minimization procedure. In the former role, once it converges, the amplitude adjustment described
in (3) is performed. In Figure 5(c), we see the reduction in error proposed by SCA versus Smoothness-based Field
Alignment, for the example in Figure 2. While ‚Äúviscous‚Äù alignment produces a complex explanation, SCA rapidly
converges, returning translation and rotation automatically as the dominant modes. Even as a standalone routine, SCA
has numerous applications from weather tracking to pattern recognition and we will review these in Section 5.
4. Coalescence
As noted in Section 1, the calculation of the ensemble mean with position errors is non-trivial. The ensemble of
vortices in Figure 6(a), for example, have a mean, shown in Figure 6(b), that looks like no ensemble member at all. It
does not account for the fact that the vortices are relatively displaced and not merely realizations of a Gauss-Markov
Ô¨Åeld with a shape-distorted mean Ô¨Åeld. In Figure 6(c), we coalesce under simple deformation constraints. The mean
in Figure 6(d) is much more realistic as a consequence. Similarly, in Figure 6(e) and (f), coalesced fronts produce a
more representative ensemble mean. We now go on to discuss a general framework for Coalescence.

Figure 6: Coalescence of vortices and fronts produces a better representation of the ensemble mean.

The problem of discovering a mean position is simple if exact correspondence between Ô¨Åelds are densely available,
but this is impractical in most problems. When correspondences are sparse, or impossible to produce because Ô¨Åelds
are only sparsely observed, or when the deformations are nonlinear and the Ô¨Åelds have complex shapes, the estimation
problem becomes much harder.
We devise a procedure that works under these conditions. It estimates the mean Ô¨Åeld X by quantifying and
marginalizing the deformation q s associated with an ensemble member X sf . With a suitable probability density representation, our Bayesian formulation leads to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) problem. In the ith iteration (i > 0)

, the E-step becomes:

f
(X ‚àí X sf ‚ó¶ q s )T B‚àí1
i (X ‚àí X s ‚ó¶ q s ) + Œõ s (q s )

(8)

s=1

The objective J estimates both displacement and the mean (amplitude) Ô¨Åeld. The displacement constraint Œõ s (q s )
can be smoothness, a turbulent spectrum or others. In the M-step, we minimized (8) by treating J as the negative loglikelihood. Looking for a stationary point yields two Euler-Lagrange equations. The Ô¨Årst one is simply an expression
for the amplitude mean for an S member ensemble:
X=

1
S

X sf ‚ó¶ q s

The second equation is one for deformation of each ensemble, and it is solved iteratively in the ith M-step. Allowing the displacement of ensemble member s in iteration j to be q(s j) , the second normal equation is synthesized
as:

s = 0. Please note that Bi is Ô¨Åxed in the i M-step and (10) is evaluated at each pixel or grid point

We may deÔ¨Åne Bi = B({X s,i }), that is a simple calculation from the ensemble (and represented in square-root form)
at the beginning of the ith step. However, note that q s,0 is not deÔ¨Åned and B‚àû is the only appropriate covariance,
and all prior ones B1 ‚Üí B‚àû represent a converging sequence. We may, in fact, have a diÔ¨Äerent sequence, one

}) + (1 ‚àí Œ≥i )I, for a scalar Œ≥i ‚àà [0, 1] and with i > 0. We Ô¨Ånd in current experiments that the EM iterations
Bi = Œ≥i B({X s,i
converge rapidly as most position errors are eliminated in the Ô¨Årst M-step iterations. Consequently, we choose Œ≥1 = 0
and Œ≥2 = 1, but other sequences can also be developed.
An interpretation of (10) is that every ensemble member experiences a ‚Äúforce‚Äù from the other ensemble members
and in this way, they all gravitate to a ‚Äúcenter of mass‚Äù or coalesce to a mean (under displacement). To the best of our
knowledge, Coalescence has not been introduced this way, but it is a foundation to quantifying ensemble uncertainty
beginning with its mean.
5. Nowcasting Storms

(a) First mode: Translation

(b) Second mode: Rotation

(c) Third mode: Shear

Figure 7: SCA automatically recovered apparent motion modes for a hurricane from Radar VIL. They correspond strongly to translation, rotation
and shear, but without such an explicit parameterization.

Many applications of Coalescence and SCA are emerging. Here, we will discuss their application in a new
DDDAS direction: Nowcasting storms.
Weather-related operational delays in US aviation run into the billions of dollars annually. At least 65% of the
aircraft delays in the US in 2009 were related to weather. Having eÔ¨Äective convective forecasts in the 0-8 hour
range can signiÔ¨Åcantly smooth out operational jitters, leading to better managed airspace and traÔ¨Éc [14, 15]. The
Nowcasting problem as it is known typically requires forecasting a quantity such as the Vertically Integrated Liquid
(VIL) that can be retrieved from radar measurements.
One way to Nowcast VIL is by using a numerical model such as the High Resolution Rapid Refresh model
(HRRR). Another way is data-driven. Time series of radar imagery are used to estimate an apparent motion, growth
and decay model of signiÔ¨Åcant convective activity (strong VIL) which is used to extrapolate current observations into
the future. As it turns out, when ‚Äúwarm-started‚Äù with new observations, numerical models display poor skill at short
forecast lead times. This is because the adjustments induced by observations have not largely equilibrated with the
rest of the model state. Clearly a data-driven VIL forecast will be perfect at a zero lead-time, but its performance
decays rapidly in time. The crossover point is typically 3 hours. Therefore, when issuing a 0-8hr forecast, we must
blend the data-driven extrapolation model with the numerical model, producing a rendition of truth that is better than
either source alone.
Here, we use SCA to build a data-driven apparent motion model, which oÔ¨Äers at least one advantage. By extracting the simplest explanation of the apparent motion Ô¨Årst and then proceeding to more complex ones at higher
wavenumbers, we can capture largescale motion ‚Äúmodes‚Äù for producing long term forecasts while rejecting highfrequency motions that tend to be short-lived and introduce undesirable dispersion in the long run. As an example, in
Figure 7, we see a snapshot of Hurricane Gustav‚Äôs Radar VIL, with estimated apparent motion vectors overlaid. These
vectors are calculated from radar VIL time series in the immediate past. There is one Ô¨Ågure for each mode, increasing
in complexity from left to right. The automatically recovered modes by SCA appear to be translation, large-scale
rotation and a more localized shear. They correctly summarize the storm‚Äôs apparent motion to the west-northwest.

Figure 8: Improvement in Data-Driven two hour forecast skill throughout the day for Hurricane Alex by SCA (pink) over current extrapolation
methods.

Thus, we may produce an optimal weighted combination of these modes from a predictability point of view, using
it as an ‚Äúapparent velocity‚Äù Ô¨Åeld with which to advect the current radar VIL into the future. SCA, used this way,
outperforms the existing methods in use by Lincoln Laboratory (‚ÄúLLExtrap‚Äù) [14, 15], based on correlation Optic
Flow, denoted CIWS and CoSPA.
As shown in Figure 8, a 120 minute (two hour) forecast of Hurricane Alex is compared with the verifying radar
VIL throughout a diurnal cycle. The CSI1 scores for SCA is shown in pink, LLExtrap (CIWS2 ) in red and LLExtrap
(CoSPA3 ) in blue. The performance is much improved in this case (it is understood by the community that CSI scores
generally change very little even when improvements are large). This is promising, and we note that a mechanism to
optimize the weighted combination will generalize these results.
The blending problem is posed in general as a fusion of model predictions with extrapolations over a 0-8hr interval,
which naturally invokes a two-point boundary value (variational) problem. Coalescence plays a key role within this
framework for blending Ô¨Åelds at any forecast time. For the experiment depicted here, we use LLExtrap as the datadriven extrapolation, and HRRR as the model. In Figure 9, we see the extrapolation and HRRR forecasts 225 minutes
out (middle column). Note that both VIL images have some overlap, but they largely capture diÔ¨Äerent aspects of the
storm. The verifying observations are shown in the top-right image. However, since this is a radar image over the
ocean, much of the storm is self-occluded, thus producing a small crescent instead of the full storm. The full storm
exists, of course, and can be seen from satellite, but depicting brightness temperature (not VIL), shown in bottom-right
panel of Figure 9.
We contrast two blending techniques, one produced using the current method and the other by Coalescence (left
column). Our reconstructions are more plausible by comparison, whereas the alternative is a little more unrealistic
(and Ô¨Çagged by evaluators as a problem case). Coalescence Ô¨Ånds a mean Ô¨Åeld by bringing the two forecasts together
in position-space up to local convergence.
Coalescence is turning out to be useful in blending but has additional use in quantifying ensemble variability
which will be further elaborated in future work.
