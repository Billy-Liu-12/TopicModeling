Abstract
Using Monte Carlo simulations, the cascade transition of a single polyelectrolyte chain having permuted charge
distribution is investigated. The polyelectrolyte chain is simulated at various solvent regimes. The eﬀect of the
electrostatic interaction strength is studied. The structures are analyzed with respect to the scaling laws. The eﬀect of
permuted charge distribution is investigated in comparison to the other charge distribution in the literature.
Keywords: polyelectrolyte, Monte Carlo simulation, cascade transition.

1. Introduction
In polar solvents such as water polymers with ionizable groups can dissociate into charged macroions and small
counterions. Most PELs are water soluble due to the gain of translational entropy of the dissociated counterions, an
eﬀect which probably contributes signiﬁcantly to their importance in biological systems. PEL solutions are controlled
by a complex interplay of short- and long-range interactions. The screening of electrostatic interactions introduces an
additional length scale into the problem. Depending on the ion strength, the screening length may be comparable to
the chain size R. However, the distribution of counterions around macroions limits not only the range of their eﬀective
interaction but due to so-called ’counterion condensation’ [1] it can also cause a renormalization of the charge of
macroions. Therefore, the most general case of PEL solution can be extremely complex and the general case of
ﬂexible PEL chains is not completely understood so far [2, 3, 4]. Due to PEL’s wide range of industrial applications
in processes involving charged colloids [5, 6, 7] and also to their resemblance to water soluble bio-polymers such as
proteins and DNA, PELs have been drawing a considerable amount of attention both theoretically and experimentally
[8, 9, 10]. For PELs, the electrostatic interactions are repulsive and long ranged. In spite of extensive investigations
of PELs, PELs are much less understood than neutral polymers.
In general three types of solvent can be distinguished: good, poor and theta solvent. In a simple mean-ﬁeld
approach due to Flory [11] the size of the polymer can be calculated at diﬀerent solvent qualities: (i) In a good
solvent, the eﬀective interaction between monomers is repulsive and the polymer chain is swollen. The end-to-end
distance of the polymer chain reads

where N is the chain length and b is the typical segment length. (ii) In a poor solvent the eﬀective monomer-monomer
interaction is attractive. In this case the polymer chain collapses to a dense globule whose size is much less the size
of an ideal chain and it reads [12]

which is the equivalent of an ideal polymer chain.
In the case of a charged polymer chain, PEL, solvent eﬀects are valid in the same manner. The end-to-end distance
is written now as the following [13]:

For a PEL in a poor solvent, the complexity arises mainly from the competition between attractive interaction and
the repulsive Coulomb interaction. An uncharged polymer immersed in water forms a spherical globule, because the
globular structure has the minimized interfacial area with the solvent. Adding charges to this polymer the globular
structure becomes ﬁrst an elongated structure and next the structures so-called pearl-necklaces [14, 15]. The pearlnecklace structures occur at charge fractions larger than a critical charge fraction

where u = λB /b gives the strength of the Coulomb interaction where λB is the Bjerrum length. The more charges
cause the PEL chain to be stretched.
For PELs diﬀerent charge distributions are introduced: annealed, quenched, smeared, permuted. In the annealed
case the charges are allowed to associate and dissociate from the chain. The case of a quenched PEL the charges are
frozen in a random conﬁguration. In the smeared case the charges are uniformly distributed along the chain. In the
case of a permuted PEL the total number of charges on the chain is ﬁxed, but the charges can move along the chain.
In this work, we report simulations of permuted PELs in diﬀerent solvent regimes and discuss the structures.
2. Model
The PEL is represented by a freely jointed bead-spring chain (Fig. 1). Along the chain the N monomers are
connected to their neighbors by a harmonic bond potential

with b0 being the (bare) average bond length (kB : Boltzmann constant and T : temperature).

springs.

The non-electrostatic interactions between the monomers, which eﬀectively include also the interaction with the
solvent molecules, are modeled by a modiﬁed Lennard-Jones potential where the interaction at distances r ≤ rc is
given by

and is zero elsewhere [16]. Monomers interact up to a distance rc = 21/6 σ. This potential contains a very narrow
attractive part such that the range of interaction remains short. The strength of the attractive interaction is set by the
parameter β (See Fig. 2). We use b0 as the unit of length, as the unit of energy, and the monomer mass, m, as the
unit of mass. All quantities are expressed in this unit systems. To ensure that the bond length distribution will be only
weakly perturbed by the short-range interaction, but remains almost Gaussian, we set σ = 1/2. The simulations were
performed at temperature kB T = 1.2. The corresponding normalized distance from the Θ point in Eq. 3 reads now

3. Simulation Method
In order to study the equilibrium properties of the system, three Monte Carlo (MC) moves are performed at each
MC step: (i) local move: a randomly chosen monomer is given a random displacement, (ii) pivot move: the right of a
randomly chosen monomer is rotated as a rigid body at a random orientation, and (iii) reptation move: one end of the
chain is randomly chosen and it is cut and appended to the other end at a random orientation. Furthermore, since the
system is a charged system and the charges are free to move along the chain, the algorithm is completed with the move
of charge, i.e., a charged monomer is chosen randomly and its charge is given to an uncharged one chosen randomly.
In order to ensure we reach equilibrium data diﬀerent starting conﬁgurations are tested: They are (i) a random coil,
(ii) a straight line, and (iii) a compact structure. It is required that these diﬀerent runs produce identical averages. In
any run, a time of at least 3 × 106 Monte Carlo steps per monomer (MCM) is spent out to reach a suﬃcient relaxation.
4. Simulation Results
4.1. Estimation of Θ temperature
The Θ temperature for the system modeled in this work is already studied and published [17]. In brief, the solvent
quality is set by β. The parameter regions corresponding to good/poor solvent conditions are required to be known,
so that the the value of βΘ which corresponds to the Θ point of the uncharged chain is estimated by simulating neutral
chains of length N = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 at diﬀerent β and plotting R2 /(Nb2 ) versus 1/N. It was found that
βΘ = 2.615 ± 0.015 [17].
4.2. Equilibrium properties
Having the βΘ point, we are now able to span the diﬀerent regimes of the solvent; that is, the regime β < βΘ
corresponding to the good solvent regime, β > βΘ corresponding to the poor solvent regime and βΘ solvent regime.
Since the interesting transitions are not found in good solvent regime, we focus mostly on the poor solvent and plus Θ
solvent regime. Note that Θ solvent regime diﬀers only in asymptotic from the good solvent regime. But any dramatic
transition is not expected in both good and Θ solvent [16, 18, 19]. On the other hand, in a poor solvent, depending
on, for example, degree of charging ( f ), a globular structure, an elongated cylinder, a pearl-necklace structure and
a stretched structure can be expected. In this work, we cover the τ values from 0.0 to 0.19. The solvent regime of
τ > 0.10 can be considered as a deep poor solvent regime, where we can try to ﬁnd the structures like pearl-necklaces.
In Fig. 3, the normalized end-to-end distance versus the scaling variable u f 2 is displayed at various τ values. It is
obvious that the PEL chains behave quite diﬀerently depending on the solvent quality. At small τ close to zero and not
too small u f 2 , the chain structure follows the behavior of a PEL chain in Θ-solvent, that is the Eq. 5. Higgs et al. [20]
reported a similar result for a charged chain near Θ point. The Θ solvent, τ = 0, the circles in the ﬁgure, exhibits a
continuous transition from a coil structure to a stretched structure. At τ N −1/2 , which becomes approximately 0.06
for N = 256, the chain structure is changed signiﬁcantly. For small u f 2 , the electrostatic interaction is too weak to
disturb the globular structure, which is the structure of a polymer chain in a poor solvent. As increasing u f 2 the chain
undergoes a transition from a globule to a coil structure. At τ = 0.07 (squares) the transition can be still accepted
as continuous, although it is diﬀerent than the transition at τ = 0.0. At τ = 0.07, at small u f 2 the structure is not a
well swollen. For higher values of τ, 0.11 (diamonds), 0.15 (triangle-ups), 0.19 (triangle-lefts), we observe a really
globular structure at low electrostatic interaction strengths (u f 2 < 0.001). But at higher charging values larger than
approximately 0.10, the structures are stretched. At the other values of u f 2 , 0.001 < u f 2 < 0.1, we may observe some
intermediate structures like a globule having a long tail, a deformed pearl-necklace structure. For a permuted PEL, we
note that pearl-necklace structures are unlikely to be seen as good as in PELs with frozen charge distributions [21].
This is explained so that the charges like to be far from the each other along the chain and this leads to have the less
probability to observe such nice pearl-necklace structure.

Looking at the snapshots, we see once again that the PEL chain is a compact globular structure in enough poor
solvent regimes if the electrostatic interaction strength is very small. In those cases the electrostatic interaction cannot
disturb the globular structure. However, at this low interaction strength, the PEL chain is found well swollen at Θpoint, which is τ = 0. At very poor solvent regimes, if the electrostatic interaction strength is enough big, we observe a
globule with a dangling tail. More charge rate is expected to be found in this tail compared to the inside of the globule,
because the charges must be positioned so that the overall interaction energy is minimized. In this parameter region, it
seems quite hard to observe the structures so-called pearl-necklaces. Above this interaction strength, a well-stretched
structure is found at any solvent regime.

in analogy to the neutral chain case, where S (q) scales as q−1/ν , with ν being the exponent of the N dependence of the
chain radii. In the ﬁgure, the dashed straight lines stands for the asymptotic behaviors for a polymer chain; that is, 1/3
for a globule, 1/2 for a Gaussian or Θ-point chain, 3/5 for a neutral chain and 1 for a fully stretched chain [8]. Note that
for a globular structure the asymptotic limit obtained for a hard sphere, which is 1/4, is used [19, 12]. The structure
factors for τ = 0.19 are also shown in Fig. 6. The asymptotic behaviors indicate that we have globular structures,
stretched structures and in between some intermediate structures. Those intermediate structures are understood that
they are a bit far from being pearl-necklaces, but a globular with a tangling tail.
5. Conclusion
Performing Monte Carlo simulations we investigate a single permuted PEL chain in diﬀerent solvent regimes, that
is, good solvent, poor solvent and also Θ-point solvent. The chain displays diﬀerent structures at diﬀerent solvent

are most likely replaced with a deformed globule, a globule having with a tangling tail. On the other hand, in a poor
solvent, a compact globular structure at low charging limit and a fully stretched structure at high charging limit are
obtained well formed.
