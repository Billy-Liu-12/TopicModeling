Abstract
Our society contains all types of organizations, such as companies, research groups and hobby clubs. Aﬃliation
networks, as a large and important portion of social networks, consist of individuals and their aﬃliation relations: Two
individuals are connected by a link if they belong to the same organization(s). Aﬃliation networks naturally contain
many fully connected cliques, since the nodes of the same organization are all connected with each other by deﬁnition. In this paper, we present methods which facilitate the computation for characterizing the real-world aﬃliation
networks of ArXiv coauthorship, IMDB actors collaboration and SourceForge collaboration. We propose a growing
hypergraph model with preferential attachment for aﬃliation networks which reproduces the clique structure of afﬁliation networks. By comparing computational results of our model with measurements of the real-world aﬃliation
networks of ArXiv coauthorship, IMDB actors collaboration and SourceForge collaboration, we show that our model
captures the fundamental properties including the power-law distributions of group size, group degree, overlapping
depth, individual degree and interest-sharing number of real-world aﬃliation networks, and reproduces the properties
of high clustering, assortative mixing and short average path length of real-world aﬃliation networks.
Keywords: aﬃliation network, hypergraph, line graph, eigvalue, power law

1. Introduction
Social networks, as one type of real-world complex networks, are widely studied [1, 2, 3, 4]. Social networks are
deﬁned as networks where nodes are individuals and links are relations between individuals, reﬂecting acquaintances,
friendships, sexual relations, collaboration, common aﬃliation, etc. Apart from many common properties of the
real-world networks, such as a high clustering coeﬃcient, a short characteristic path length and a power-law degree
distribution, social networks also exhibit assortative mixing and community structure [4, 5, 6, 7].
Aﬃliation networks, an important type and a large portion of social networks, have not yet been well understood
and modeled. The nodes of aﬃliation networks represent individuals. If two nodes in an aﬃliation network have the
same membership, for instance, they belong to the same institute or they work for the same project, then they are
connected by a link. Examples of aﬃliation networks include movie actor networks (nodes represent the actors and
two actors have a link if they have been casted together in one or more movies), science coauthorship networks (nodes
represent the scientists and two nodes are connected if they have coauthored one or more articles), journal editor

networks (nodes as the editors and two editors are adjacent if they serve on the same editorial boards of journals) and
sports player networks (nodes as players and two players who played in the same games are connected)1 .
Aﬃliation networks naturally contain many fully connected subnetworks which are called cliques or complete
subgraphs in the language of graph theory, since the nodes of the same group, such as a movie cast, are all connected
with each other by deﬁnition. The clique structure of aﬃliation networks increases largely the percentage of triangles
among the three hops walks, consequently resulting in high clustering coeﬃcient. The aﬃliation networks also show
high assortativity. Besides the statistics of individuals such as clustering coeﬃcient, characteristic path length and
nodal degree, we are also interested to answer the following questions: How many groups are there? How many
individuals does a group have? How many groups does an individual belong to? How many individuals do two
groups have in common? how many groups do two individuals belong to together (It is be useful for recommandation
systems)? And to how many groups is a group adjacent (Two groups are adjacent if they have individuals in common)?
In Section 4, we attempt to gain more information on the structure properties of aﬃliation networks by answering
these questions in the cases of the ArXiv coauthorship networks of subjects of ”General Relativity and Quantum
Cosmology” and ”High Energy Physics - Theory”, the IMDB movie actors collaboration network and the SourceForge
software collaboration network. In Section 3, we introduce the analytical properties on the topology and spectra of the
aﬃliation networks. In Section 5, we propose a preferential attachment based growing hypergraph model for aﬃliation
networks. The nodes of the hypergraph model represent the groups of aﬃliation networks, and the hyperedges,
connecting multiple nodes, represent the individuals. Numerical analyses show that our hypergraph model reproduces
all the properties of aﬃliation networks.
2. The representation of aﬃliation networks
2.1. Preliminaries
Suppose the aﬃliation network under consideration has N individuals and M groups, where an individual may
belong to multiple groups. The membership number m j of an individual j is deﬁned by the number of groups of which
j is a member. The degree d j of an individual j equals the number of individuals who have the same membership
in one or more groups. The interest-sharing number αi, j of individuals i and j is deﬁned by the number of groups to
which they both belong, which indicates how many common interests they share. The group size sk of group k is the
number of individuals that belong to group k. The group degree uk of group k equals the number of groups sharing
individual(s) with group k. The overlapping depth βk,l of two groups k and l equals the number of individuals that
they share. An aﬃliation network is linear if βk,l ≤ 1 for all k, l ∈ [1, M], where M is the number of groups. If the
membership number m j = m for j ∈ [1, N], the aﬃliation network is called a m-uniform aﬃliation network.
We use the graphs in Figure 1a to exemplify the deﬁnitions of d j , m j , αi, j , sk , uk , and βk,l . The graph in Figure 1a
(1) has labeled ﬁve nodes which are members of at least two groups. Obviously, d1 = 24, d2 = 12, d3 = d4 = 8 and
d5 = 9. Nodes 1 − 5 belong to 5, 3, 2, 2 and 2 groups respectively, thus m1 = 5, m2 = 3 and m3 = m4 = m5 = 2.
Individual 1 and 2 belong to only one common group, hence αi, j = 1. As shown in Figure 1a (2), the groups I − IV
have 6, 5, 5 and 6 nodes respectively, hence, sI = sIV = 6 and sII = sIII = 5. Evidently, the overlapping widths:
βI,II = 2, βI,III = 1, βI,IV = 3, βII,III = 2, βII,IV = 0 and βIII,IV = 1. The group degree: uI = uIII = 3, uII = uIV = 2.
An aﬃliation network is usually described by a graph where the nodes represent the individuals and two nodes are
connected by a link if they both belong to a group or several groups. If a set C I of individuals belong to group I, the
set C I of individuals comprise a fully connected clique. If a set C II (C II ⊆ C I ) of individuals also belong to another
group II, we cannot represent the group II by this graph description, because the set C II of individuals are already
fully connected inside the group I. Newman et al. [8] suggested a bipartite graph model with all information preserved
by representing a group with one type of nodes and individuals with the other type of nodes, where links only connect
nodes of diﬀerent types, as shown in Figure 1b. Lattanzi et al. [9] proposed a bipartite-graph-based generative model
for aﬃliation networks. However, the bipartite-graph-based model does not reproduce all the aﬃliation networks’
topological properties shown in Section 3. Hence, we introduce the hypergraph representation of aﬃliation networks.
1 Some biological networks can also be classiﬁed as aﬃliation networks including protein interaction networks with proteins as nodes, of which
two are connected by a link if they involve in the same functional category or more. In this paper, we focus on aﬃliation networks of social
networks.

2.2. Hypergraph representation
A hypergraph is the generalization of a simple graph2 . A hypergraph H (M, N) has M nodes and N hyperedges3 .
Its nodes are of the same type as those of a simple graph, as shown in Figure 2 (a). The hyperedges of hypergraphs
can connect multiple nodes, like hyperedge A in Figure 2 (a) connecting nodes I, II, · · · , V. A hypergraph is linear if
each pair of hyperedges intersects in at most one node. Hypergraphs where all hyperedges connect the same number
m of nodes are deﬁned as m-uniform hypergraphs with the special case that 2-uniform hypergraphs are simple graphs.
If an aﬃliation network is linear, the representing hypergraph is linear; if an aﬃliation network is m-uniform, the
representing hypergraph is also m-uniform.
We propose to describe an aﬃliation network with M groups and N individuals by a hypergraph H (M, N): M
nodes represent the M groups; N hyperedges represent N individuals; and an hyperedge is incident to a node if the
corresponding individual is a member of the corresponding group.
The line graph of a hypergraph H (M, N) is deﬁned as the graph l (H), of which the node set is the set of the
hyperedges of H (M, N) and two nodes are connected by a link of weight t, when the corresponding hyperedges share
t node(s). The degree d j of an individual j, deﬁned in subsection 2.1, equals the number of individuals that connect
to j in the line graph l (H). The line graph l (H) is an unweighted graph when the corresponding hypergraph is linear;
otherwise is weighted, and the weight of link i ∼ j equals the interest-sharing number αi, j .
2.3. An illustrative example
In this subsection, we give an exemplary aﬃliation network and then represent it by a hypergraph. Table 1 describes an aﬃliation network based on the aﬃliations of members of the NAS research group (Network Architectures
and Services Group at Delft University of Technology). Individuals A, B, C, D, E, F are members of NAS and the
2A

simple graph is an unweighted, undirected graph containing no self-loops nor multiple links between the same pair of nodes
use the term ”hyperedge” instead of ”hyperlinks” in order not to make confusion with hyperlinks of WWW webs.

Figure 2: (a) The hypergraph representation of the NAS aﬃliation network described in Table 1. The hyperedges are the blue ellipse-like closed
curves. The nodes are the disks with diﬀerent colors marked with Roman numerals. A node and a hyperedge are incident if the node is surrounded
by the hyperedge. The hyperedges and nodes represent the individuals and the groups respectively. Individuals participate in multiple groups,
implying that the groups overlap with each other. (b) The line graph of the hypergraph in (a), which is a simple graph. The nodes here denote the
individuals while the communities consist of links of the same color and the nodes which are incident to them. Note that this graph is also the line
graph of the hypergraph.

other individuals are the members of groups which overlap with the NAS group. Figure 1b depicts the bipartite graph
representation of the NAS aﬃliation network with the blue circles representing the groups and the solid blue disks
representing the individuals. Two nodes are linked when the corresponding individual belongs to the corresponding
group.
We represent this network by the hypergraph H (12, 53) shown in Figure 2 (a). The nodes of the hypergraph
denote the groups and the individuals are denoted by the hyperedges. There are 12 groups as described in Table 1,
corresponding to the 12 nodes of the hypergraph in Figure 2 (a), and there are 53 individuals among whom 6 NAS
members with the membership number mA = 5, mC = mD = 3, mB = mE = mF = 2. If an individual belongs to
multiple groups, the corresponding nodes are connected by the hyperedge specifying that individual.
Figure 2 (b) depicts the line graph l (H) of the hypergraph H (12, 53) in Figure 2 (a), which represents the exemplary NAS aﬃliation network. In the line graph l (H), the individuals are denoted by nodes and the groups are denoted
by links of the same color and the nodes which are incident to those links. The line graph l (H) is unweighted since
the NAS aﬃliation network is linear.
3. Properties of aﬃliation networks
3.1. Topological properties
The line graph l (H) has N nodes and L links. The topology of l (H) can be described by its adjacency matrix A, a
N × N matrix, where the element ai j equals the linkweight of link i ∼ j if there is a link between node i and node j,
else ai j = 0. Since l (H) is undirected, the adjacency matrix A is symmetric.

where m is the membership number of an individual. When the aﬃliation network is linear, we also have αi, j ≤ 1.
The adjacency matrix Al(H)

entries in the kth row/column of W M×M .
3.2. Spectral properties
3.2.1. The adjacency spectra of l (H) of m-uniform aﬃliation networks
A m-uniform aﬃliation network can be represented by m-uniform hypergraphs Hm (M, N), of which the unsigned
incidence matrix R has exactly m one-entries and M − m zero-entries in each column. Thus, all the diagonal entries
of RT R are m. The adjacency matrix of the line graph of Hm (M, N) can be written as,

The adjacency matrix Al(H

3.2.2. The adjacency spectra of l (H) of non-uniform aﬃliation networks
A non-uniform aﬃliation network with maximum membership number mmax can be represented by a non-uniform
hypergraph H (M, N). The unsigned incidence matrix R of H (M, N) has at most mmax one-entries in each column.
Therefore, the largest diagonal entry of RT R is mmax . The adjacency matrix of the line graph of non-uniform hypergraph H (M, N) is,

4. Real-world aﬃliation networks
4.1. ArXiv coauthorship network
We analyze the arXiv data of subjects of ”General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology” (GR-QC) and ”High
Energy Physics - Theory” (HEP-TH) in the period from January 1993 to April 2003, which were collected by J.
Leskovec et al. [12]. We construct the hypergraph with the papers as nodes and the authors as hyperedges. A
hyperedge is incident to a node if the corresponding author authors/coauthors the corresponding paper. In this manner
we construct the hypergraph of the arxiv GR-QC coauthorship network with 5855 authors and 13454 papers, and the
hypergraph of the arXiv HEP-TH coauthorship network with 9877 authors and 21568 papers. We ﬁt the data of s, β,
m, d and α with the power function f (x) = x−γ . The values of γ are shown in Table 2. The group size s follows a
power-law distribution. In this case of coauthorship network, the group size s means the number of authors a paper
has. As shown in Figure 3a and 3b, We see that, in the coauthorship networks of both subjects, the papers with only
one author and with more than ten authors are very rare. Most of papers have two or three authors. The group degree u
in both Figure 3a and 3b has a power-law tail. The group overlapping depth β follows a power-law distribution4 . The
membership membership m of an individual here means the number of papers he or she authors and coauthors, and
also follows a power-law distribution. The interesting sharing number α, denoting the number of papers in which two
individuals participate together, follows a power-law distribution5 . The ArXiv coauthorship networks of both subjects
possess high clustering coeﬃcient, large assortativity coeﬃcient and short average path length as shown in Table 2.
4.1.1. IMDB movie actors collaboration network
The data of IMDB movie actors collaboration network with 127823 movies and 392340 actors, were collected by
Hawoong Heong from Internet Movie Database (based on www.imdb.com). We construct the hypergraph of IMDB

of the pairs of groups have no overlap. We only consider the group pairs which overlaps with each other.
only consider the individual pairs who have nonzero interest-sharing number.

collaboration network and (b) the SourceForge software collaboration network.

4.1.2. The SourceForge software collaboration network
SourceForge is a web-based project repository assisting developers to develop and distribute open source software
projects. SourceForge facilitates developers by providing a centralized storage and tools to manage the projects. Each
project has multiple developers. We construct the hypergraph of the SourceForge software collaboration network
by taking software projects as nodes and the developers as hyperedges. A hyperedge is incident to a node if the
corresponding developer participates in the corresponding software project. The SourceForge software collaboration
network has 259252 software projects and 161653 developers. We ﬁt the data of s, u, β, m, d and α with the power

function f (x) = x−γ . As shown in Figure 4b, the pdfs of all the six metrics d j , m j , αi, j , sk , uk , and βk,l are well ﬁtted
by power law functions with exponents γ shown in Table 2. The SourceForge network also has a high clustering
coeﬃcient, a high assortativity coeﬃcient and an small average path length, which are shown in Table 2.
5. Modeling of aﬃliation networks
5.1. Model description
As stated before, we use the nodes of hypergraph to represent the groups and the hyperedges to represent the
individuals. In the description of our model, the nodes and groups, the hyperedges and individuals are used interchangeably. Our model is a growing hypergraph model, starting with a small hypergraph which represent the initial
groups and individuals. Later on, new individuals and new groups are added to the network in the growing process.
We notice that the number of group M is larger the number of individuals N in ArXiv networks and Sourceforge
network, and M is smaller than N in IMDB network. Making a movie needs more eﬀorts and labor force than writing
a paper or developing an open-source software. In our model, we take M
N = 1, assuming that each coming individual
start a new group. Note that the group size of real-world aﬃliation network follow a power-law distribution. We
employ preferential attachment of individual to the existing groups to achieve the power-law distributed group size.
The tricky issue is to determine the membership number of each new coming individuals, namely to decide how
many nodes that a new hyperedge should connect to. The analysis of real-world aﬃliation networks tells a power-law
distribution of the membership number, hence we preproduce a power-law distributed sequence of numbers, taking
them as the membership numbers of new coming individuals.
Our hypergraph model is described by the following procedure:
1. Start with a seed hypergraph H0 (M0 , N0 ) with M0 groups and N0 hyperedges.
2. Suppose that the desired number of individuals (hyperedges) of the network to be generated is N+N0 . Determine
the membership numbers for the N new hyperedges: Γ = m1 m2 · · · mL . Note that the membership
number vector Γ is the input parameter of our hypergraph model.
3. At growing step j, j = 1, 2, · · · , L, add a new hyperedge j and a new group to the hypergraph. Make the new
hyperedge j and the new group incident, and the membership number of j becomes 1.
(a) Connect the new hyperedge j to the existing group i with probability pi = si / si , where si is the group
size of i and si is the sum of group sizes of all the existing groups.
(b) Repeat 3a) m j − 1 times so that the membership number of the hyperedge j increases to m j .
4. Repeat 3) until the number of hyperedges increases to N + N0 .
Compute the metrics d j , m j , αi, j , s j ,u j and βi, j using the methods given in Section 3.1 including the formulas (1)
to (5).
5.2. Simulation results
We use a hypergraph H (20, 20) with the membership number m j = 1, j = 1, 2, · · · 20, as the starting seed. We
add 5000 new hyperedges (individuals) and 5000 new nodes (groups) to the starting seed through 5000 growing steps.
Hence, all the hypergraphs we generate have 5020 nodes and 5020 hyperedges. We generate a sequence of natural
numbers following a power-law distribuion with the pdf Pr [Γ = m] = m−2.02 . In the growing process, we apply this
sequence of natural numbers as the membership numbers. We denote the group size and group degree of a random
group by S and U, the group overlapping depth of a random pair of groups by B, the individual degree of a random
individual by D, and the interest-sharing number of a random pair of hyperedges by Φ.
Due to the principle of preferential attachment, we expect that the group size of all the generated hypergraphs
follow power law distributions, which are conﬁrmed by Figure 5. Futhermore, group degree u, individual degree d,
group overlapping depth β and individual interest-sharing number α also follow power-law distributions. Our model
reproduces the power-law distributions of s, u, d, β and α observed in real-world aﬃliation networks with similar
exponents as shown in Table 2, and also reproduces the properties of high clustering, assortative mixing and short
average path length exhibited by real-world aﬃliation networks.

Figure 5: The probability density distribution of group size s, group degree u, individual degree d, group overlapping depth β and individual interestsharing number α of our growing preferential-attaching hypergraph model. The membership numbers are input parameters, follows a power-law
distribution. The hypergraph model reproduces the power-law distributions of s, u, d, β and α observed in real-world aﬃliation networks.

6. Conclusion
Aﬃliation networks are an important type of social networks. We propose a hypergraph representation which
reproduces the clique structure of aﬃliation networks. We give analytically the topological and spectral properties
of aﬃliation networks. We also present formulas which facilitate the computation for characterizing the real-world
aﬃliation networks of ArXiv coauthorship, IMDB actors collaboration and SourceForge collaboration. We propose a
preferential attachment based growing hypergraph model for aﬃliation networks. Numerical analyses show that our
hypergraph model reproduces the power-law distributions of group size, group degree, overlapping depth, individual
degree and interest-sharing number of real-world aﬃliation networks, and reproduces the properties of high clustering,
assortative mixing and short average path length of real-world aﬃliation networks.
