Abstract
Access to information and interaction with peers are dominant demands of collaborative research. To provide
academicians information regarding research papers, peers and events there are some research information repositories
overleaping the need of interaction and collaboration. Although the booming growth of social networking sites has
already captured huge audience from academic ﬁeld, research shows existent Social Networking Services (SNSs) are
mostly hedonic thus having a superﬁcial contribution to research based interaction. To address this unmet demand,
some systems have tailored the concept of SNS to ﬁt research oriented social networking. Though they provide an
interactive platform for researchers they lack in information visualization, binding location and time with research and
evaluation of research work and related bodies. Hence our solution VizResearch uniﬁes fragmented functionalities
across existing platforms and brings all research beneﬁcent features under a single hood.
Keywords:
Scientiﬁc Collaboration, Social Network, Online Community, Location Based Service.

1. Introduction
Social networking reﬂects the social relations among people who share common interests, activities, beliefs or
knowledge. It operates on many levels removing the boundary of time, space and language. SNS reveals the links
between real world people. Whether it is making new friends, ﬁnding a new job, promoting business, or locating a
destination these links between people come useful. By providing people a sense of ubiquitous connectedness and a
platform to share multiple point of views social networking sites are getting popular rapidly.
As the harbinger of social-networking hype, facebook [1] now has more than 800 million active users [1], and
growing at a rate of around 83 percent per year on average over the last 5 years [1]. Among other SNSs twitter [2], hi5
[3], myspace [4], orkut [5] and rapidly emerging Google+ [6] contribute to connect people from anywhere anytime.
Scientiﬁc research demands such connectedness among researchers to ensure collaboration and interaction. Research collaboration is any research activity that is carried out by multiple individuals overcoming institutional, disciplinary, and geographic boundaries. By collaboration, researchers can combine their strengths thereby producing
more reliable and powerful results. It can enlarge the creation of innovation and save resources too.

There are situations when a researcher searches for publications and references, when a freshman looks for research funding and a supervisor to work with, or when an academician wants up-to-date information of any particular
research ﬁeld, or looks for upcoming events, i.e., seminar, conferences on a speciﬁc topic. Only dealing with factual
information makes the task diﬃcult and time consuming. Rather the urge is to connect researchers and their work
across time and space only using a mouse-click. Also each research ﬁeld gets deeper every day with increased amount
of research works and the number of people involved. Given this inherently social and dynamical nature of research,
an interactive network platform is urgently needed to fuel cooperation and information exchange globally.
As social networking services allows identity and network management, information management, and communication with peers [7] researchers can harness it to boost up research collaboration. Though existing SNSs can support
interaction via message posting, chatting, ﬁle sharing, limited group based activity among researchers, they can only
superﬁcially beneﬁtted from these virtual communities. Currently these SNSs do not support managing academic proﬁle with updated publication list, co-author list, visualization of important research relationships, sharing publications
or specialized search for publications, peers or events. Most importantly, these hedonic social networking sites can
distract a researcher in many ways i.e., streams of non-academic news feeds, message, status updates as everyone in
the network is not opting for research [8].
Even if we consider only research based interaction in current SNSs dropping information sharing and management, still it is not convincing. Being facebook friend for work discussion has some privacy issues [8]. It shows that
lack of threaded discussion hampers the growth of appropriate interactive environment [9].
While some researchers have explored use of SNS in education, very few have delved into the methodology of how
it should be integrated in research. Current studies include drawing out essential requirements for social networking
in academic environments comprising of students, teachers, administrators and researchers [10], investigating present
status opportunities and challenges of educational applications in SNS [11], integrating SNS in a formal learning
environment [12]. Another research explores intersection of online social networking with medical professionalism
[7]. A comparison of faculty and student responses indicates that students are more likely than faculty to use facebook
and are signiﬁcantly more open to the possibility of using facebook and similar technologies to support classroom
work.
In another study while students have found class social networking more user-friendly and comfortable giving
them a sense of belonging [13], using existing platforms i.e., facebook often leads to some drawbacks. Concerns
related to privacy and anxiety in interacting with professors in this environment [14], a belief that it does not serve an
academic purpose [15] and the opinion that faculty should simply avoid educationally appropriating these backstage
social spaces [16] have been expressed [17]. Another work shows that where students use facebook for formal or
informal learning purpose involving student-to-student interaction they are less likely to use it for teaching purpose
involving instructor-student interaction [18].
Current research indicates while people welcome integrating concept of SNS with educational or academic purpose [17], [9], [18] using existing SNS is not indisputable. In this regard we propose niche social networking which is
tailored to meet speciﬁc demands of research. Such concept is not unprecedented as blackboard, moodle, sakai, teachstret.com are educational SNSs, Academia.edu [19], mendely [20] and ResearchGate [21] are research oriented SNSs.
Our uniqueness lies in identifying the complete set of needs encompassing interaction, collaboration and information
management and binding them into a single platform.
2. Related Works
As stated earlier, currently there are some platforms to fuel research activities. Some of them provide researchers
with various research-oriented data regarding publication, events, or researchers while others emphasize on interaction
and collaboration of researchers. Hence they can be categorized into two types:
• Research Information Management Tools
• Social Networks for Research Communities
2.1. Research Information Management Tools
Underscoring the signiﬁcance of information management, currently, Google Scholar [22], CiteSeerX [23], Pubzone [24], ArXiv [25] along with professional bodies like IEEE [26], ACM [27] satisfy academicians demand on research information substantially. They provide information for publications based on keywords, authors, conferences,

1418

Sarah Masud et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1416 – 1425

and journals. Microsoft Research [28], a research division of Microsoft, works for developing various computer science ideas and integrating them into Microsoft products [29]. This site shares publications, project updates, videos
and information on researchers. But it focalizes only the domain of Computer Science and deprives a huge majority
of academicians from other faculties.
Microsoft Academic Search [30], a free academic search engine of Microsoft Research [28], covers more than
27 million publications and over 16 million authors across a variety of domains with weekly updates [29]. It allows
users to innovatively explore and visualize academic papers, authors and events using co-author graph, citation graph,
call for paper CFP calendar and domain trend. They are the ﬁrst to merge the concept of location with research.
Here users can visualize the geographical location of researchers and events on map. ArnetMiner [31] is another
impressive tool like Microsoft Academic Search [30] for visualization of research related information. It comes up
with comprehensive search and mining services [31].
Although the above mentioned platforms meet up the demand of information impressively, there is no support for
collaboration and interaction between researchers.
2.2. Social Networks for Research Communities
With the rapid growth of web 2.0 technologies, academicians along with the rest of the online population increasingly use niche SNSs like, LinkedIn [32], Academia.edu [19], ResearchGate [21], mendeley [20], Researchr.org [33],
Epernicus [34], ResearcherID [35], SciSpace [36], Dropbox [37]. Here we are focalizing on the major sites.
LinkedIn [32], oﬃcially launching at 2003 and connecting more than 120 million people by August 2011, is the
fastest growing professional- networking site [32]. It allows members to create business contacts, search for jobs,
and ﬁnd potential clients. Individuals have the ability to create their own professional proﬁle. Ultimately, this is
business-related social networking and has very little to contribute to research.
More than half a million [19] academician users update and share information about their work and interests
in Academia.edu [19] making it probably the largest social network for academicians. Features like friend ﬁnding,
status update, maintaining online academic proﬁle, searching jobs, news feedback contributed to its buzzing demand.
Though people can interact through following and exchanging personal messages, there is a lack of support for groupbased interactions.
ResearchGate [21], currently involving over 1.2 million users, came up with the idea of crowd-sourced research
[21]. Unlike Academia.edu [19] it supports workgroup besides small scale personal interaction. Presenting information on people, publications, events and jobs with only a single search query fuels to its popularity. Its powerful semantic search capacity scouring internal resources and some external research databases has outdone that of
Academia.edu [19].
Mendeley Desktop is a cross platform tool for organizing research paper collection and citations. It automatically
extracts references from documents, generates bibliographies from your PDFs and turns them into a searchable fulltext database. It also syncs continuously with other reference managers like Zotero or CiteULike. Mendeley Web lets
you access your research paper library from anywhere, share documents in closed groups, and collaborate on research
projects online [10].
Although Academia.edu [19], ResearchGate [21], and Mendeley provides useful news feed of papers, conferences,
and job news they lack some eﬀectual features. Namely, they neglect to bind location as a parameter for ﬁnding people
or events, which academicians will ﬁnd very helpful. None of them provide any visualization of various important
research relationship, like, adviser-advisee hierarchy, co-author chain and citation chains. Users can not ﬁlter the
news feed they provide which results into a constantly clogged feed with information about people and paper one is
not interested in. There is also an opportunity to improve these platforms by utilizing user-feedback and number of
citations of publications to develop a ranking of research literatures. This ranking can be further used to formulate
ranking of authors and their corresponding institutions. Thus a dynamic evaluation of research work can be performed.
Based on the over-all activities in various research ﬁelds i.e., number of interested researchers, publications, events a
research trend curve can be also generated. The above discussion can be summarized in Table 1.
Presently, there is no single system to meet up the demand of information and demand of collaboration simultaneously. One need to explore too many sites which is time consuming. More importantly, traversing sparse platforms
along with ones group and peers can baﬄe even the smartest one. Hence our solution VizResearch is to bring all
vital research facilities under the same hood, namely, information sharing, information visualization, interaction and
dynamic evaluation of research.

3. Our Work
The main four components of VizResearch includes information sharing, visualization, user interaction and
dynamic evaluation of research. Here one can maintain his academic proﬁle while viewing those of others. Researchers can interact via personal message and follow option. Like-minded people can form groups and share ﬁles,
create events, and run threaded discussion. One can search for all research related essential information here, regarding publication, events, and peers. These searches are fortiﬁed using time and location as parameters. After accessing
a publication one can post review or rate it. A ranking for papers is generated using number of citations and user
rating. This ranking is further extended to rank corresponding authors and their institutions. Moreover, based on the
overall participation of researchers from various ﬁeld a research trend curve is generated. The four components are
described here in detail.
3.1. Sharing Information
It involves mainly two types of information, regarding researchers and publications as shown in Figure 1. While
signing-up for the site one needs to provide basic research related information like, academic background, research
interest, supervisor and so on. Based on the provided information and our existing database, a supervisor tree is
constructed representing the adviser-advisee hierarchy. In Figure 2, a typical supervisor hierarchy has been presented.
The person on the top is the supervisor of the person just below him. Similarly, the person who is second from the
top is actually supervisor of the person just below him. As the supervisor of the person on top has not enrolled in the
system, his information is not available. In this way VizResearch oﬀers us a visualization of the academic genealogy.
Authors can share their publications partially or fully maintaining copyright issue. Upon sharing a paper, the
publication list and co-author list are automatically updated in corresponding proﬁles of authors. Thus as in Figure
3, ones publication list, co-author list, research experience -everything appears in his proﬁle, making his complete
academic proﬁle reachable within a mouse click.

Figure 2: Supervisor tree of a user
While sharing a paper citation data is also extracted from paper. In the detail view of a paper one can ﬁnd the
forward links i.e., the papers that cited this paper as well as backward links i.e., the papers this paper cited. As a result
publications of similar topic are much easier to get. Besides, as shown in Figure 4 the detail view of a paper aggregates
information like, authors, bibliography, date of publication, publishers, keywords, venue of publication etc.
3.2. Information Visualization
Here users can search in following criteria:
• Paper: keyword(s) can be topic, publication year, publisher, author.

Figure 4: Detail view of a paper containing forward and backward link
• People: keyword(s) can be research interest, institute, location.
• Events: keyword(s) can be topic and/or location.

• Group search.
To increase eﬃcacy of searching, search results of researchers and events are visualized in Google Maps. Upon
searching for a event one can ﬁnd all the details of that event, i.e., organizers, venue, submission deadline, event
scope, important dates etc. One can also join such event as this virtual participation notiﬁes him about that event via
SMS and e-mail before due date. These features tie people, event, time and location together.
3.3. User Interaction

Figure 5: Schematic diagram of user interaction
Users can explore proﬁles of others and initiate interaction by following or sending personal message. In case
of follow, one gets several updates from person he is following, such as, recent publications, recent events, groups
or status update. To enhance interaction, people of similar interest can create groups. Groups can be restricted or
open for all. Thus there is a chance to share something conﬁdential with desired audience. Group members can share
ﬁles, post message, run threaded discussion on a topic and arrange or notify about events like, conference, seminar,
workshop. The total interaction hierarchy is plotted in Figure 5.
3.4. Dynamic Evaluation of Research Work
As one can browse publications, he can rate and review them. Based on their rating and number of citation of the
paper, its impact factor is calculated. While showing search result of paper, they are sorted according to this impact
factor. An author is rated based on the impact factor of his publication(s). Eventually using the rating of member
researcher(s) a ranking of institutions is generated.
Based on the overall research activities of users, a research domain trend is presented plotting research impact
versus year. We have considered number of researchers, publications and related events to calculate research impact.
In Figure 6 such a curve is presented showing trend in 4 major branches of computer science namely Algorithms,
System, Software Engineering (SE), and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). It shows more people are inclining to AI and
Systems rather than Algorithm. It should be noted that we have used our system database to formulate such trend.
This database is developed from researchers who enrolled in the system. The categorization of a subject is done by
researchers when they create account and add research details. One can add new sub-branch to an existing branch
or can start a whole new branch as his research interest. This categorization is visible to all account holders. As in
social networks we are more inclined towards collective intelligence, we preferred researchers themselves to create
and enlarge such research interest categorization.

4. Discussion
This system is built with ASP.Net on Microsoft .Net framework 4.0 using C#. As the backend support we used
Oracle 11g.
4.1. Usability
This system supports Unicode(AL32UTF8) based character set. So it can store multiple language groups. Using
this feature the system can be enhanced to provide a multi-lingual interactive web service like LinkedIn [32]. Academic institutions can use this system to maintain their local repository as well as conduct interactive communication
between expert and novice researchers. It can contribute to connect the world’s best scientiﬁc thinkers with researchers
in isolated and remote areas overleaping institutional, disciplinary and geographical boundary. It can reveal a network
of like-minded academics and keep them updated about the latest research.
4.2. Business Feasibility
Various professional and research oriented sites like LinkedIn [32], Academia.edu [19], ResearchGate [21] are not
only welcomed by academicians but they also caught the attention of venture capitalists. In the later part of last year
investors from the US, UK and Germany converged to oﬀer a ﬁrst round of capital to ResearchGate [21]. Investors
included the co-founder of generalist SNS Bebo, Michael Birch and the co-founder of global price comparison platform Idealo.com, Martin Sinner [38]. On the other hand LinkedIn [32] is publicly held and has a diversiﬁed business
model with revenues coming from hiring solutions, marketing solutions and premium subscriptions [32]. This system
can follow any of the ways. To make a self sustaining platform we can maintain a job board.
4.3. User Friendliness
To make the system more cohesive and user friendly we considered page load speed, accessibility, navigation and
most importantly information. It is easy to search and access information regarding paper, peers and events. Google
maps provide better visualization of location based search result. It is designed to be browser compatible and excludes
unnecessary ﬂash contents and lumbering graphics. Almost all pages are only two click away from the home page.
When running as a real time application, it can easily incorporate user-developed applications. Thus the dynamic
demand of users can be met.

1424

5. Future Work
Though our system covers prominent features for fueling research based activities there are few things to promote
it. Currently the text miner can extract data only from .pdf ﬁles. Better data mining tools can be used for data
extraction from publications in various ﬁle formats. A lighter version of the system can be developed to ensure easy
access from smart phone. For more ﬁnancial robustness we intend to maintain a job board.
As the idea to get all researchers in a single platform is quite ambitious, improved algorithm can be embedded to
extract information from distributed web about people who are not in the community presently. To enrich the repository, this system can be a client to a subset of data provided in a research information system. The repository can be
further extended by exchanging data between various institutions on mutual agreement. Location based organization,
researcher and event ﬁnding facility with GPS data can be implemented. Moreover we plan to generate a recommendation system for researchers to accelerate collaborative research based on interest and location of peers. Currently
we are working on these updates.
6. Conclusion
In essence VizResearch brings all vital research facilities namely, information sharing, visualization, peer interaction, and dynamic evaluation of research and researchers under a single hood. It aims to become a platform to link
the knowledge of people and people with the knowledge and thereby fueling research collaboration and information
exchange globally.
