Abstract
Ab initio calculations on the basis of quantum molecular dynamics CPMD (Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics)
code are used to simulate the resistance-change in amorphous carbon. These simulations show that the resistance
change is related to changes in the atomic structures of conducting dots due to thermal eﬀects. Diﬀerent scenarios
of the temperature growth and possible annealing procedures are considered. The energy gap between two structural
stages and the density of states at diﬀerent temperatures are determined. The electronic density is used to identify
conductive pathways through the system. A multiscale model of resistance switching based on the reduced Ehrenfest molecular dynamics is suggested. This computational model combines long-time-scale CPMD calculations of
thermodynamic equilibrium states with the short-time-scale calculations of transitions to a new conﬁgurations using
excited states of the electronic system. The simulations were performed on the IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer at
Moscow State University.
Keywords: quantum molecular dynamics, computational multiscale model, amorphous carbon, phase change

1. Introduction
Recently, many investigations have focused on the use of various forms of carbon, such as nanotubes, graphene,
and amorphous carbon (a-C) for nonvolatile phase-change memory [1]. This work describes simulations of nanometerscale resistance-switching experiments conducted at IBM Research-Z¨urich [2].
Carbon exists in multiple forms, the most prominent being the sp2 -dominated graphitic form with its low resistivity
and the sp3 -dominated diamond form with its high resistivity [3]. The electric properties of a-C are inﬂuenced not
only by the sp2 /sp3 ratio; there is also evidence that other mechanisms can aﬀect the conductivity, for example, sp2
clustering and sp2 ﬁlamentation, which are processes involving the reorganization of bonds and that do not change
the sp2 /sp3 ratio. The possibility of resistance change in a-C at the nanoscale makes a-C a promising candidate for
nonvolatile memory applications.

The exact mechanisms responsible for the change in electrical conductivity are still being debated, and a deeper
understanding of the resistance-change mechanism is needed. Is the resistance change ﬁeld induced or thermally
induced? Is the mechanism involved rehybridization or a rearrangement of carbon atoms? These investigations have
to be conducted at the scale of tens of nanometers appropriate for memory applications.
A cascade of computational models should be used to simulate the diﬀerent properties of conducting dots in a-C,
and the appropriate combination of models should be built. Small scales can be generally described ﬁrst-principles calculations. In such studies, supercomputer calculations are used to describe the space scale on the order of 3 nm on the
100 ps time scale; the electrons are in the ground state and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation applies. Electronic
structure switching through excited states is a faster event, and hence a new model is needed to resolve the problem.
The combination of these computational models to simulate the electronic properties and the ion conﬁgurations is the
subject of this study.
The sizes of carbon clusters and the forces between clusters cannot be determined from ﬁrst-principles models
because their applicability is restricted to system of few hundreds of atoms. For this macroscopic models, such as
classical models with empirical potentials, are usually used. These models can be used to describe processes involving
complex rearrangement of atoms in large systems (104 -106 atoms), such as formation of clusters or mixed phase in
amorphous or microcristalline materials.
Molecular dynamic simulations with empirical potentials were used to describe diﬀerent structures of a-C [4].
Structures of tetrahedral a-C (ta-C) were also studied via ﬁrst-principles calculations [5]. An electric moleculardynamics (MD) method is proposed in [6], in which an electro-heat solver is introduced into a traditional MD simulation to perform a coupled calculation.
This study aims at understanding the resistance-change mechanism in a-C via ﬁrst-principles Car-Parrinello MD
simulations using the CPMD code [7] and the multiscale model proposed in [8] using excited states simulations.
Diﬀerent initial atomic conﬁgurations are chosen for the calculations. We focused on thermally induced eﬀects on the
atomic structure caused by Joule heating in the experiment. The energy gap is calculated for atomic conﬁgurations at
diﬀerent temperatures, and a statistical analysis is performed.
Simulations of percolation through the conducting sites on the based on the electronic density are presented, and
diﬀerent values isosurface the density are analyzed to gain insight into the resistance switching in the system.
Calculations were run on the IBM Blue Gene/P at Moscow State University. Each run required approximately 56h
(of elapsed time) on 512 nodes. Based on the electronic states computed in the density-functional-theory framework,
a multiscale model for describing the dynamic aspects of switching process is proposed.
The paper is organized as follows: the computational model and details are described in Sec.2. The structures
resulting from the MD simulations of a-C are described in Sec.3. The electronic properties of these conﬁgurations are
presented in Sec.s 4-6, and the conclusions are given in Sec. 7.
2. Computational model
In this section we review the basic equations behind the density functional theory (DFT) and the Car-Parrinello
(CP) method [9].
The CP method is based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the forces acting on nuclei are calculated
by solving the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations for the ground state [10]. The movement of massive nuclei is described
via Newton dynamics.
An elegant approach to simultaneously propagate the electronic and the nuclear degrees of freedom was presented
by Car and Parrinello in 1985 [9]. The equations of motion derived from the extended Car-Parrinello Lagrangian can
for nuclei and electrons be summarized as:
¨ I (t) = − ∂ E KS [{ψi }, {RI }],

where MI and RI are the mass and the coordinate of nucleus I, μ is the ﬁctitious electronic mass, ψi are the Kohn-Sham
orbitals and E KS is the Kohn-Sham energy. The last term in equation (1) is a holonomic constraints, which takes in
account the orthogonality requirement of the orbitals. Therefore, in each simulation step the forces acting on the ions
− ∂R∂ I E KS and on the orbitals − δψδ E KS , and the Lagrange multipliers Λi j have to be calculated.

electrostatic interaction.
CPMD works entirely in plane waves (PW) as basis set for expanding the valence molecular orbitals and pseudopotentials to describe the core electrons. Within the PW formalism, the wave function vectors ψi (Kohn-Sham
orbitals) can be written as:
1
ψi (r) = √
Ω

ci (G)eiGr ,
G

where Ω is cell volume, G is the reciprocal lattice vector and ci (G) are the Fourier-coeﬃcients of orbital i.
First-principles CP simulations were performed within the framework of density functional theory supplemented
by generalized gradient corrections[11]. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials are used and KS orbitals are expanded in
the PW basis set up to a kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 70 Ry, a ﬁctitious electronic mass of 500 a.u., and a time step of 0.125
fs. Friction of electrons is used to stabilize Car-Parrinello scheme, when we simulated the amorphous carbon system.
The simulations are performed in the cell described in the next section (with 3D periodic boundary conditions). For
geometry optimizations, the norm of the maximum force vector was required to be smaller than 10−4 Hartree/Bohr at
convergence.
3. Simulation of atomic structure changes of a-C at diﬀerent temperatures
In this section, we present the results of the thermally-induced mechanism of resistance changes in a-C, which we
modeled with a mixed phase containing sp-, sp2 -, sp3 -like C atoms. In the unit cell, there are two truncated graphene
layers in a diamond matrix. The simulation box contains 192 C-atoms: 70 two-fold, 44 three-fold, and 78 four-foldcoordinated ones, see Fig.1. The size of cell is 14.268 × 10.701 × 10.701 Å3 , corresponding to a density n = 2.34 cmg 3 .
The value of density has been chosen to investigate general phase transition properties in a-C from the theoretical
point view. Starting from the system of Fig. 1, independent constant volume and temperature CPMD simulations
are performed at diﬀerent temperatures ranging from 300K to 4000K, but all of them below the melting point. The
temperature in each simulation is controlled by a Nos´e-Hoover thermostat [12], and each simulation is from 50 to 100
ps long. In the following, we will refer to the set of MD simulations as “independent” heating runs.
Two types of conﬁgurations are the product of these simulations: conﬁgurations that maintain a mixed phase consisting of sp2 /sp3 bonds, cf. Fig.2(a), and conﬁgurations that only contain sp2 -like C-atoms assembled in a defective
graphitic layer, cf. Fig.2(b). The former type of conﬁguration is produced at lower temperatures, i.e. T≤2000K,
the latter at higher temperatures, T=3000 and 4000K, where the thermal energy is suﬃciently high to promote bond
breaking in the sp3 matrix to form sp2 bonds. The structures resulting at T≥2000K are graphite, with defects such as 5and 7-member rings. After the formation of graphite, even at T=4000K the bonds will not break for the entire duration
of the simulations. The main results of these simulations are that the sp3 -like C-atoms of the mixed phase of Fig.1

disappear, that the systems evolve into graphite, the thermodynamically stable phase of carbon at standard condition,
and that these transformations are possible at temperatures below the melting temperature during the relatively short
time of our simulation. In Fig. 3(a), the number of sp2 and sp3 -like atoms is plotted as a function of the temperature
to monitor the evolution of the structural transformations induced by heating. Its analysis shows that the number
of sp2 graphitic-like atoms increases (red curve with crosses) and that of sp3 diamond-like atoms decreases (green
curve with “×”) as the temperature increases. These changes indicate transitions from a disordered mixed phase to a
graphitic-like state. In addition, the analysis of the atomic conﬁgurations at diﬀerent temperatures clearly shows that
graphitic sites suppress the diamond sites. The increasing number of sp2 atoms during heating leads to the formation
of graphitic rings.
To investigate the reversibility of these phase changes, we performed two additional simulations. We select two

geometries resulting from CPMD simulations at T=300K and 4000K as starting point for two new MD simulations.
The conﬁgurations obtained at T=300K was heated to 4000K (“sequential” heating), whereas the conﬁguration obtained at T=4000K was quenched to room temperature. Snapshots corresponding to structures obtained at diﬀerent
temperatures from “independent” and “sequential” heating and the quenching runs are optimized for the analysis. In
particular the KS energies were computed, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3(b). In this “sequential” heating,
the heating rate varied from 1013 K/s to 6x1013 K/s. KS energies of the ﬁnal states for “sequential” heating are given
in Fig. 3(b) (green curve with “×”). Annealing started from the atomic conﬁguration obtained at T=4000K in the
“independent” heating. The annealing was performed by reducing at a constant rate the temperature from T=4000K
to T=300K during an MD simulation lasting 2ps. The KS energies of the states obtained during annealing are shown
in Fig. 3(b) (blue curve with starts).
The highest KS energies in both the “independent” and the “sequential” heating occur at T=2000K, suggesting
that at this temperature the energy barriers for bond reorganization of the mixed phase are accessible, but that the temperature is not high enough for a complete conversion to graphite, and the system remains entrapped in the metastable
phase of Fig. 2(a). At higher temperatures (T=3000 and 4000K), graphite forms and remains stable; after graphite
formation no bond is broken. The plot in Fig. 2(a) shows the transition path from the amorphous to the graphitic-like
state. The main conclusion from these simulations is that the changes in the clusters structure can occur at temperatures below the melting point for the mixed phase of Fig.1, used in this work as prototypical example of a-C. This
changes can be considered as threshold temperature eﬀect, which results in resistance switching.
4. Calculations of the density of states and the energy gap
Using ﬁrst-principles calculations, we can study the electronic properties of a system, that determines the conductivity of the material. The electrical conductivity is directly proportional to the density of one-particle states D( )
(DOS) in the conductivity zone. As an example, in the case of homogeneous metal at temperature T the components
of the electrical conductivity tensor for degenerate electronic gas can be determined as follows [13]:
σαβ = e2

τvα vβ −

∂ f0
D( )d (α, β = x, y, z),
∂

(2)

where vα vβ is the average of vα vβ over the energy surface, f0 is the equilibrium Fermi distribution function, and τ is the
relaxation time, after which system reaches equilibrium. For degenerate system, the derivative of Fermi distribution
function has a sharp maximum at = F ( F is the chemical potential or Fermi energy). Thus, the conductivity can be

646

rewritten as
σαβ = e2 τvα vβ F D( F ),
where vα vβ F is the average value over the Fermi surface =
D( ) =

and D( F ) is the density of states, D( F ) =

D(E) integrated over the energies is equal the number of states in the box of volume V. The Dirac function in equation
(4) is approximated by Gaussians with semi-width of 0.02 eV. We used only the Γ-point to integrate the Brillouin
zone, and the Fermi energy is set equal to the highest occupied orbital. Calculation of the DOS yields information
on the presence of an energy gap between the occupied and the empty states, which plays a role in determination
of the conductivity of the system, although many other aspects must also be kept into account. We use the DOS to
determine which conﬁguration (diamond-like or graphitic-like) contains the highest DOS and therefore determines
the conductance. Second, we would like to know how the size of conducting dot aﬀects the value of the DOS?
We found that the projection of the DOS on sp2 sites for ﬁnal states, obtained by the “independent” heating at
diﬀerent temperatures, increases with temperature.
To tackle the second problem, we performed a simulation at T=2000K using a simulation box with double volume:
the longer edge has been doubled and the box size is 28.536 × 10.701 × 10.701Å3 . The system consists of 384
atoms, see Fig.4. MD calculations for double cell required roughly 36 hours of elapsed time on 1024 nodes to reach

four-fold-coordinated ones.

thermodynamic equilibrium.
The DOS of Eq. 4 for single and double cells are shown in Fig. 5(a). The area below each DOS up to the Fermi
energy correspond to the number of occupied states per cell. For the small cell the Fermi level is E F = 7.44eV,
for the big cell is E F = 7.38eV. It is seen that the DOS on Fermi level is increased 2.5 times, i.e. more than the
factor two expected from using a double volume box. This indicates that at larger scales the process of combining
graphitic clusters becomes more intensive. The energy gap which should be overcome for the switching process to
occur is calculated for conﬁgurations obtained at diﬀerent temperatures in the “independent” heating. Here we should
estimate whether thermal eﬀects have suﬃcient energy to overcome the energy gap. These calculations are needed
to estimate the temperature range in which the phase transition occurs. Formally, the energy gap is deﬁned only
for crystals, whereas it is poorly deﬁned for amorphous material. There is no long-range order (no periodicity) for
such materials. However, to describe the switching process due to excitation states, we could deﬁne energy gap for a
given conﬁguration as Eg = E LU MO − E HOMO (HOMO is the highest occupied molecular orbital, LUMO the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital). The energy gap is averaged over diﬀerent conﬁgurations. To compute the average
and the standard deviation, we we took 10 conﬁgurations taken from the last part of each MD run at time interval of
100 fs. For comparison, also the thermal energy kT is included in Fig. 5(b). Analysis of these calculations shows

that in the range of 900-2000K the increase in the maximum Eg is less than kT . The maximum Eg is larger kT for
T=900K. Thereby, structural changes start in this range. The maximum value of Eg is equal to kT at T=2000K, so it
means that T=2000K could be considered the critical temperature. We compared our calculations with experimental
measurements of carbon cluster gaps. In the experiments [14] it was found that the gap in carbon clusters occur up to
0.65eV. The energy gap size we obtained is in agreement with these experimental observations.
5. Simulation of percolation process using quantum MD calculations.
Our percolation analysis is based on following approach. We consider granules, or islands, consisting of sp2
graphite-like atoms as conductive cluster structures. When these clusters are connected along the entire thin-ﬁlm
structure, the switching occurs. We use the level lines (isosurface values) of the electronic density (a 3D surface) to
identify the connections between these sp2 clusters. We used percolation theory algorithms [15] to build the threshold
line. At each temperature the electronic density was obtained at the end of the MD run in the “independent” heating
when thermodynamical equilibrium was reached and the atomic geometry optimized. An example of a threshold level
line for T=2000K is shown in Fig. 6. One can see the two clusters consisting of rings of graphitic-like chains. Along
these chains electronic transport occurs. The results of percolation analysis built on the basis of the electronic density
suggest that the conductivity increases in the interval T=900K-2000K.
The calculations reveal graphitic-like structures at the percolation threshold, but the graphitic layers become helical, which will be important for analyze at a larger nanometer scale the stability of the structure.
6. Multiscale model of conductivity switching based on the knowledge of the electronic excited states
The thermally induced changes in the atomic structure of a-C in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld are
analyzed by means of a multiscale model of conductivity switching.
As we can calculate electronic KS orbitals, we can build a reduced model on the base of Ehrenfest MD and time
dependent DFT[16],[17]. The goal is to obtain the electronic density perturbation due to the external electric potential
and the correspondent forces on nucleus in a system.
We expand the electronic wave functions using the full set of KS orbitals to get the solution of time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation:
Ψ(r, R, t) =

(6)

The time dependence of the coeﬃcients cm (t) represents the evolution of the system in time. To describe ionic system
evolution we introduce reaction coordinate s(R), which describe phase transition in the a-C. The concentration of sp3 like atoms is used as reaction coordinate s(R). We deﬁne the concentration of sp3 -like atoms as a ratio N sp3 /N, where
N sp3 and N are number of sp3 -like atoms and number of all atoms in the system, correspondingly. We relate changes
the concentration of sp3 -like atoms to resistance change in a-C. The Free Energy Surface (FES) proﬁle F(s) as a
function of the reaction coordinate s(R) can be reconstructed. We use long timescale ground state CPMD calculations
to reconstruct F(s). The corresponding motion equation for the reaction coordinate is

Our multiscale approach is based on the separation of scales. Long time scale CPMD calculations permits us
reconstruct F(s) along chosen reaction coordinate. We also obtain equilibrium structures of ionic positions at diﬀerent temperatures in these CPMD runs. These calculations are ground state calculations, because excited states are
excluded from simulation. We built our multiscale model to ﬁnd transition path from low conductive amorphous
structure to high conductive graphitic-like structure, which were obtained in CPMD calculations. The advantage of
multiscale model is that it enables the evolution of system through excited orbitals under external threshold potential.
To integrate the system (7)-(8) at fast time scale, we calculate for each ﬁnal equilibrium state HOMO and LUMO. In
comparison with [8], we should to take into account amorphous structure of material. For that we use several calculations of equilibrium states at T=2000K and we ﬁnd averaged positions of ions. For these positions we determine
HOMO orbitals and excited orbitals (with some probability). Process of electronic switching is determined by overlapping integrals for HOMO and other excited orbitals. The system (8) is used for calculations of electronic system
switching.
Switching process at fast time scale is shown in ﬁg. 7. Switching of amplitudes of HOMO and LUMO orbitals at
fast time scale occurs around ground averaged state obtained at T=2000K from long time CPMD calculations.
7. Conclusions
We performed ﬁrst-principles CPMD simulation of amorphous carbon to study the mechanisms responsible of
the changes in electric resistivity. We investigate the evolution upon heating of a mixed phase consisting of sp2 /sp3
C-atoms, used in this work to model a-C. The system was investigated considering diﬀerent heating and quenching
protocols. The energy gap between the amorphous and the graphitic stages at diﬀerent temperatures and the evolution
of the density of states show the resistivity switching. We found that the atomic structure changes occur below the
melting point of a-C: at T=3000 and 4000K we observed formation of graphite. Percolation calculations on the basis
of the electronic density are used to study the evolution of the low-resistivity graphite phase formed from the mixed
sp2 /sp3 high-resistivity phase. A multiscale model of the conductivity switching based on the Ehrenfest MD and the
knowledge of electronic excited states computed from CPMD enable the analysis of the response of the system to an
external electric ﬁeld, to compare thermal and ﬁeld induced resistance changes.
