One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that
the paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Re-use of any data should be appropriately cited. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The
scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers
that this was not detected during the submission process.
