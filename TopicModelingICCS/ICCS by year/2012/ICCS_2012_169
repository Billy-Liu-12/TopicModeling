Abstract
The problem of thermal dispersion effects on unsteady free convection from an isothermal horizontal circular cylinder to a nonNewtonian fluid saturating a porous medium is examined numerically. The Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer model is employed to
describe the flow field. The thermal diffusivity coefficient has been assumed to be the sum of the molecular diffusivity and the
dynamic diffusivity due to mechanical dispersion. The simultaneous development of the momentum and thermal boundary layers
are obtained by using finite difference method. The stability conditions are determined for each difference equation. Using an
explicit finite difference scheme, solutions at each time-step have been found and then stepped forward in time until reaching
steady state solution. Velocity and temperature profiles are shown graphically. It is found that as time approaches infinity, the
values of friction factor and heat transfer coefficient approach the steady state values.

Keywords: Finite difference method; stability; non-Newtonian fluids; porous media; free convection

1. Introduction
A number of industrially important fluids such as foods, polymers, molten plastics, slurries and pulps display
non-Newtonian fluid behavior. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a non-linear relationship between shear and strain
rates. In most of the previous studies of non-Newtonian fluids flow through porous media, Darcy’s law was used.
For many practical applications, however, Darcy’s law is not valid, and inertial effects may need to be taken into
account. Several research works have been found in the literatures concerning the problem of coupled flow and heat
transfer in saturated porous media including different set ups and boundary conditions. To highlight an incomplete
list and for the sake of completion, we mention a number of these research work. Cheng [1] and Plumb [2]
introduced a model for flow and heat transfer in porous media in which thermal dispersion effects are taken into
consideration. Recently, Mansour and El-Amin [3] investigated the effects of thermal dispersion on non-Darcy
axisymmetric free convection in a saturated porous medium with lateral mass transfer. On the other hand thermal
dispersion-radiation effects on non-Darcy natural convection in a fluid saturated porous medium have been studied
by Mohammadein and El-Amin [4]. Chen and Chen [5] presented similarity solutions for free convection on nonNewtonian fluids over vertical surfaces in porous media. Nakayama and Koyama [6] studied the natural convection

over a non-isothermal body of arbitrary shape embedded in a porous medium. Darcy-Forchheimer natural, forced
and mixed convection heat transfer in power-law fluid saturated porous media was studied by Shenoy [7]. The
problem of buoyancy induced flow of non-Newtonian fluids over a non-isothermal horizontal plate embedded in a
porous medium was studied by Mehta and Rao [8]. Beithou et al. [9] investigated the effects of porosity on free
convection flow of non-Newtonian fluids along a vertical plate embedded in a porous medium. Numerical modeling
of non-Newtonian fluid flow in a porous medium using a three dimensional periodic array was presented by Inoue
and Nakayama [10]. The problem of forced convection heat transfer on a flat plate embedded in porous media for
power-law fluids has been studied by Hady and Ibrahim [11]. Katagiri and pop [12] discussed the unsteady laminar
free convection near an isothermal horizontal circular cylinder. Also, Aldoss and Ali [13] investigated the problem
of mixed convection from a horizontal cylinder in a porous medium. Mohammadien and El-Amin [14] presented the
problem of thermal radiation effects on power-law fluids over a horizontal plate embedded in a porous medium. The
problem of unsteady and steady-state concentration boundary layer adjacent to a ceiling wall of a stagnation-point
flow region resulting from hydrogen impinging leakage is investigated [15-17]. The purpose of this paper is to study
the problem of thermal dispersion effects on unsteady free convection from a horizontal circular cylinder to a nonNewtonian fluid saturated porous medium. The Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer model which includes the effects of
boundary and inertia forces is employed. The dimensionless non-linear partial differential equations are solved
numerically using an explicit finite-difference scheme. The values of friction factor and heat transfer coefficient are
determined for steady and unsteady free convection.
2. Analysis
A schematic diagram of the physical model is shown in Figure 1. Consider the unsteady, laminar boundary layer
in a two-dimensional free convective flow of a non-Newtonian fluid over an isothermal horizontal circular cylinder
embedded in a porous medium domain. At time t 0 , the temperature of the surface immersed in the fluid is raised
suddenly from that of surrounding fluid T , up to a higher and constant value Tw and kept at this value thereafter.
Under the Boussinesq and boundary layer approximations, the governing mass, momentum and energy conservation
equations become:

In the previous equations, u and v are the velocity components along x and y axis. The temperature of the
surface is Tw and far away from the surface this value is invariant and is represented by
T . , , , , F , k , K , , d and g are the density, the thermal diffusivity, the volumetric coefficient of thermal
expansion, the porosity, the empirical constant, non-Newtonian consistency index, the permeability, the dispersion
coefficient whose value is usually less than 0.3, the pore diameter and acceleration due to gravity, respectively.

where ij and eij are the tensors of stress and strain rates, ij is the unit tensor, I2 is the second invariant of the
strain rate, p is the pressure and n is the power flow behavior index of the fluid (n>0). For n=1, it reduces to a
Newtonian fluid, for values of n<1 the behavior is pseudoplastic and, when n>1, the fluid is dilatant.
The inertia terms on the left hand side of Equation (2) may be neglected for small permeability. But for higher
permeability media, near the leading edge the inertia terms are significant, while the shear stress term remains
significant for a large distance.

3. Method of Solution
This section is concerned with the numerical method used in the solution of the present unsteady problem. The
solution of a set of three, simultaneous, nonlinear partial differential equations by the finite-difference method,
employing an explicit technique (a simple example with more details was explained by Carnahan et al. [20]). The
numerical integration was carried out on the time dependent form of the nonlinear partial differential Eqs. (7)-(9),
subject to the initial and boundary conditions (10).
Successive steps in time may be regarded as successive approximations towards the final steady state solution,
for which both u / t and T / t are zeros, one way such a solution may be achieved is by considering the
corresponding unsteady state problem. The spatial domain under investigation must be restricted to finite
.
dimensions. We consider xmax=50, and regarded y=ymax=20 as corresponding to y
An explicit method will be used. Consider u , v and T denote the values of u, v and T at the end of a time-step.
A selection set of results have been obtained covering the ranges 0.5 n 2.0 , 0.0 Ds 0.5 , 5 Pr 10 ,
1 Gr 3 , 0.03 k1 0.05 and 0.02 k 2 0.04 . The steady state condition was assumed to exist when u / t ,
and T / t approached zero in the unsteady state problem. The system of equations were solved for the dependent
variables u, v and T as functions of x, y and t. Successive steps in time can then be regarded as successive
approximations toward the steady state solution. The velocity and temperature fields were calculated for various
time steps for a 25 10 grid. An examination of complete results for t=10, 20,..., 90, revealed little or no change in u,
v and T after t=90 for all computations. Thus the results for t=90 are essentially the steady-state values.
4. Stability Conditions
Here, the stability conditions of the finite difference scheme are determined. Because an explicit scheme has been
used, we investigate the consistency of the largest time-step with the numerical stability. At an arbitrary time t=0,
the general terms of the Fourier expansion for u and T are e i ( ax by ) , i
1 . At a later time t, these terms become
u
(t )e i ( ax by ) , T
(t )e i ( ax by ) .
Substituting in the corresponding difference equations and regarding the coefficients u and v as constants over
after the time-step by
and
, we obtain,

Since, the heated fluid rises in the positive x-direction, u may be assumed everywhere non-negative. Also, we
assume that v to be everywhere non-positive, because, the fluid is drawn in from the positive y-direction to take its

5. Results and Discussion
Equations (7)-(9) subject to the conditions equation (10) were solved by the finite difference method. Figures 2-5
illustrate the velocity profiles for different values of the parameters t, n, Ds, k1, k2, Pr and Gr. Figure 2 illustrates the
development of the velocity field with time until steady-state conditions are achieved with various values of n. As
time increases, we observe that the momentum boundary layer thickens and the velocity maximum increases. Also,
from the same figure we note that as the power-law index n increases the velocity maximum increases near the
surface, while it decreases far from the surface. Figure 3 indicates that as the dispersion parameter Ds increases the
velocity maximum increases. We observe from Figure 4 that as the parameters k1 and k2 increase, the velocity
maximum decreases. Figure 5 display results for velocity profiles with various values of the parameters Pr and Gr.

We note that as Pr increases the maximum velocity decreases, while it increases as Gr increases. Figures 6-10
show the temperature profiles for different values of the given parameters. Figure 6 illustrate the development of the
temperature field with time. The thermal boundary layer thickness increases with time. We note that as the power-

660

M. F. El-Amin et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 651 – 660

law index n increases the temperature profiles increase, as plotted in Figure 7. It is clear from Figure 8 that as the
dispersion parameter Ds increases the temperature profiles increase. Also, Figure 9 indicates that both k1 and k2
enhances the temperature profiles. Furthermore, we observe from Figure 10 that due to an increase in the parameters
Pr and Gr there is a fall in the temperature profiles. In Figure 11, friction factor and Nusselt number are plotted as
functions of X for various values of the parameters Pr and Gr. It is clear from this figure that Gr enhances the wall
shear stress and the heat transfer rate but they are reduced as Pr increases.
Table 1 represents the variation of friction factor and Nusselt number for pseudoplastic fluid (n<1), Newtonian
fluid (n=1) and dilatant fluid (n>1) with various values of the time. From Table 2 it can be seen that due to an
increase in Ds there is an increase in the wall shear stress and a fall in the heat transfer rate. Also, from the same
table we note that both the parameters k1 and k2 reduces the wall shear stress and the heat transfer rate.
