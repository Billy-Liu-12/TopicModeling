Abstract
In this paper, we consider the mathematical modeling and simulation of a fluid-structure interaction algorithm
applied to a multiphysics application involving atherosclerotic arteries which is known to lead to health risks and
mortality. More specifically, narrowing of an artery that can result from a plaque deposit causes severe reduction of
the blood flow. Modeling such diseased arteries requires modeling the unsteady blood flow interacting with the
compliant arterial vessel wall as well as a plaque in an efficient way. In this work, we will present a comprehensive
model of these multi-physics phenomena that incorporates both geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity for
the arterial wall and a non-axisymmetric plaque that interacts with unsteady blood flow. In particular, these models
indicate the generation of recirculation zones at various locations near the plaque which could potentially enhance
the risk of the formation of a clot. In particular, our results indicate the importance of incorporating nonlinearity
both in the material and geometry in the modeling.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, the rapid development of computational science has provided new methodologies to solve
complex multiphysics applications involving fluid-structure interaction to a variety of fields. These include solving
applications involving blood flow interactions with the arterial wall to computational aeroelasticity of flexible wing
micro-air vehicles. In these applications, the challenge is to understand and develop algorithms that allow the
structural deformation and the flow field to interact in a highly non-linear fashion. Not only is the non-linearity in
the geometry challenging but in many of these applications the material is non-linear as well that makes the problem
even more complex. Direct numerical solution of the highly non-linear equations governing even the most
simplified two-dimensional models of such fluid-structure interaction, requires that both the flow field and the

domain shape be determined as part of the solution, since neither is known a priori.
The past few decades, however, have seen significant advances in the development of iterative methods. Coupled
with advances in finite element methods and domain decomposition methods, these have provided new algorithms
for such large scale multiphysics simulations. There have been several methods that have been introduced in this
regard and their performance has been analyzed for a variety of problems. One such technique is the mortar finite
element method which has been shown to be stable mathematically and has been successfully applied to a variety of
applications [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and references therein]. The basic idea is to replace the strong continuity condition at the
interfaces between the different subdomains modeling different multiphysics by a weaker one to solve the problem
in a coupled fashion. Such novel techniques provide hope for us to develop new faster and efficient algorithms to
solve complex fluid-structure applications. A variety of methods have been introduced including the level set
methods [7], the fictitious domain methods [8, 9], non-conforming hp finite element methods [4, 10], multilevel
multigrid methods [11] and the immersed boundary methods [12]. While these methods help enhance our ability to
understand complex processes (such as the interaction of blood flow with the arterial wall), when used in
conjunction with traditional MRI and CT scan image reconstruction tools, there is still a great need for efficient
computational methods that can not only help simulate physiologically realistic situations qualitatively but also
analyze and study patient-specific modeling of such processes quantitatively.
Cardiovascular atherosclerotic arteries that often consist of diseased plaques are known to be the leading cause of
health risks and mortality. More specifically, narrowing of an artery that can result from a plaque deposit causes
severe reduction of the blood flow. Modeling such diseased arteries requires modeling the unsteady blood flow
interacting with the compliant arterial vessel wall as well as a plaque in an efficient way. It is well known that the
presence of a plaque can significantly alter the characteristics of the blood flow in arteries which can then lead to the
development of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease. In current clinical practice, the degree of the luminal
narrowing determines the need to surgically remove an existing plaque [13]. The Doppler ultrasound technique that
is currently employed uses the maximum peak systolic and diastolic blood flow velocities as well as the spectral
composition of these velocities. Although this technique is in universal clinical use, there have been problems in the
use of this technique. Moreover, due to the nature of the associated strong coupling of the plaque with the blood
flow and arterial wall, there is a great need to develop coupled models to understand the displacement of the plaque
and its interaction with the flow. These often results in recirculation zones around the plaque that lead to the
formation of a thrombus, that eventually leads to a heart attack or a stroke.
To estimate the stress levels on the plaque surface, fluid structure interaction analysis has emerged as an efficient
computational tool that has combined computational fluid dynamics for the blood with structural mechanics of the
surrounding elements such as the arterial wall and the plaque [14, 15]. In these papers, the authors conducted a
finite element analysis to examine the fluid structure interaction of pulsatile and unsteady flow through a compliant
stenotic artery respectively. They both observed complex flow patterns and high shear stress at the throat of the
plaque and their results indicated critical plaque stress/strain conditions are influenced by a variety of biomechanical
factors. Most of the prior simulations have used a geometrically linear material approximation. There is a lot of
evidence and experimental results that suggest that soft tissues undergo large deformations (which cannot be
modeled via an infinitesimal deformation) that make them geometric nonlinear structures. Hence the nonlinear
terms play an essential role in understanding the failure of a structure which brings us to the focus of this work.
The focus of this paper will therefore be to present and apply a coupled fluid-structure interaction algorithm to
simulate a biological application that involves both geometric and material non-linearity. In particular, we will
present the mathematical modeling and simulation of a fluid-structure interaction algorithm applied to a
multiphysics application involving atherosclerotic arteries. More specifically, we will present a comprehensive
model of these multi-physics phenomena that incorporates both geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity for
the arterial wall and the plaque that interact with unsteady blood flow. In particular, these models indicate the
generation of recirculation zones at various locations near the plaque which could potentially enhance the risk of the
formation of a clot. The outline of the paper is as follows. We first describe the mathematical model and the
associated governing equations for a model problem. This is divided into three parts, the model for the fluid
components, the structural components and the coupled fluid-structure model. The numerical section then presents
the performance of these models in the presence of various types of non-linearities and the influence they have on
the parameters of interest.

2. Mathematical Model and Governing equations
In this section, we will consider the multi-physics interaction of nonlinear structural domain interacting with an
unsteady fluid medium. For simplicity of presentation, we consider the following computational model that involves
multiple non-linear structural elements (arterial vessel walls and the plaque deposit) that interact with the unsteady
blood flow. The computational domain is illustrated in Figure 1.

equilibrium of the traction between the fluid and the structure on the respective fluid-structure interfaces.
In continuum mechanics, there are two types of non-linearity that often arises in various applications. The first type
is related to the constitutive law that dictates how the material responds to applied loads. This leads to a nonlinear
relation between the stress s and the strain . In this work, we consider two different constitutive models for the
structural domains that include a linear elastic as well as a hyperelastic model. The second type of nonlinearity
arises when the strain
varies nonlinearly with respect to the displacement. The total strain tensor for a typical
geometrically non-linear model is written in terms of the displacement gradients:

Modeling the coupled fluid-structure system

In order to account for the changing nature of the fluid and solid sub-domains, one must define a dynamic mesh for
the space discretization. However, to avoid extreme distortion, we choose to move the mesh independently of the
fluid velocity in the interior of the fluid domain. Such a scheme, called arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
formulation, is commonly applied when studying fluid-structure interaction [10, 16]. This choice allows us to use a
Lagrangian framework for modelling the structure and a mixed formulation for modelling the fluid. In particular, we
express the time derivatives as functions of Lagrangian reference coordinates, while the derivatives with respect to
space are left as functions of the fixed Eulerian coordinates. To do this we define a mesh velocity w that describes
the velocity of the mesh nodes as a time derivative of the deformation function. The ALE formulation for the fluid
equation then becomes:

be partitioned into m non-overlapping sub-domains { i }im 1 such that the intersection of any two
sub-domains is empty, a vertex, or a collection of edges of the respective domains. In the latter case, we denote this
interface by ij which consists of individual common edges from the domains i and j . Over each subdomain, a
fully coupled system is solved for the solution variables, namely, the velocity, the pressure, the stress vector and the
structural displacements. The solution to the associated fluid-structure interaction problem is then achieved via an
iterative strategy, where the systems of equations (11)-(12) along with the continuity equation are solved separately
and in succession, always using the latest information, until convergence is reached.

Numerical Results

In this section, we will present the performance of the coupled algorithm applied to the model problem presented
earlier. In all our experiments, the blood is modelled to enter the artery from the left side via a Poiseuille parabolic
(see figure 2) profile whose amplitude is time dependent (in order to simulate a cardiac beat). In particular, we
model the mean inlet velocity via:

In this model, we consider the arterial wall and the plaque to be modelled as geometrically nonlinear as in Case II.
However, the material is now considered to be hyperelastic compressible neo-Hookean model. We also choose the
arterial wall properties to be different from the properties of the plaque. In particular we choose the following values

The prescribed inlet velocity profile attains a maximum value at about t=0.215 sec. The velocity and stress
distributions at four different times are presented in figure 3 for the MNGN model. Figure 4 illustrates the surface
pressure and velocity profiles at t=0.215 sec. The maximum values of the von Mises stress and the velocity values
for each of these simulations is illustrated in figure 5. Both the multiphysics simulations as well as the maximum
values clearly show the importance of including the nonlinear effects in the material and the geometry. The values in
figure 5 clearly indicate that the nonlinearity of the geometry increases the value of the stresses and the maximum
velocity. These also create multiple recirculation zones with the model in MNGN creating vortex formation (see
figure 3) which could potential lead to very high shear stresses near the throat of the plaque. The later can induce
thrombosis which can totally block blood flow to the heart or brain. Detection and quantification of such vortices is
very valuable and can serve as the basis for surgical intervention.

At the coordinate (136, 41) micrometers in the computational domain which was on the surface of the first hill of the
plaque, we measured the displacement and the velocity profiles for all times. Specifically, Figure 6 illustrates the xand y- components of the structural displacement. Not only is the movement of the plaque evident from these plots
but also it indicates the influence of the nonlinear effects in material and geometry on controlling the displacement.
The completely nonlinear model (MNGN) shows the extreme behavior of the three models.

Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the mathematical modeling and simulation of a fluid-structure interaction algorithm
applied to a multiphysics application involving atherosclerotic arteries. The model incorporated both geometric
nonlinearity and material nonlinearity for the arterial wall and the plaque that interacted with unsteady blood flow.
The results clearly indicate the generation of recirculation zones at various locations near the plaque which could
potentially enhance the risk of the formation of a clot. Three separate models were considered in this work and their
influence on the behavior of the plaque was studied. The results indicate that a plaque modeled as a materially
nonlinear and geometrically nonlinear shows evidence of recirculation that is different from those that are modeled
using linear models. Such studies are essential to get a good insight into the risk of rupture of a plaque. In this work,
we considered the flow to be Newtonian. In the future study we plan to consider effects of non-Newtonian
rheological properties incorporated along with this materially and geometrically nonlinear model developed and
presented in this paper.
