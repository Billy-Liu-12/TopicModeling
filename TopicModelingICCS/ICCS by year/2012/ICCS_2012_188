Abstract
This article presents an Agent-Based modeling (ABM) simulation to design a decision support system (DSS)
for Healthcare Emergency Department (ED). This DSS aims to aid EDs heads in setting up management guidelines
to improve the operation of EDs. This ongoing research is being performed by the Research Group in Individual
Oriented Modeling (IoM) at the University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB) with close collaboration of Hospital ED
Staﬀ Team. The objective of the proposed ABM procedure is to optimize the performance of such complex and
dynamic Healthcare EDs, because worldwide most of them are overcrowded, and unable to provide ad hoc care,
quality and service. Exhaustive search (ES) optimization is used to ﬁnd out the optimal ED staﬀ conﬁguration, which
includes doctors, triage nurses, and admission personnel, i.e., a multidimensional problem. An index is proposed to
minimize patient length of stay in the ED. The results obtained by using an alternative pipeline scheme to ES are
promising and a better understanding of the problem is achieved. The impact of the pipeline scheme to reduce the
computational cost of exhaustive search is outlined.

1. Introduction
Health is one of the most appraised gifts for human beings; therefore, it is crucial to preserve it. Healthcare
Units were designed to take charge of it. Healthcare systems have evolved during the previous decades, speciﬁcally
Emergency Department (ED). ED is a primary healthcare department, usually the main entrance to the hospital, and
a key component of the whole healthcare system. EDs are semi-autonomous units that are open and staﬀed 24 hours
per day, 365 days per year, including holidays. The original mission of EDs is to primarily handle only emergent
situations. However, ED visits include a wide range of illnesses and injuries, i.e., truly emergencies, urgent, semiurgent, and nonurgent cases. EDs have increased their resources to attend all of those cases, becoming large, complex
and dynamic units. Nevertheless of such an increase, patients continue to suﬀer, since they do not have access to ad

hoc healthcare, in some cases due to the ineﬃciencies of the EDs functioning. As a result of this, EDs are overcrowded
and the length of stay (LOS) of patients has increased, whereas quality of service has decreased. Indeed, overcrowding
of EDs is a worldwide issue, and a national crisis in US [1]. Although ED overcrowding is not a new topic, since it
was documented in the literature 20 years ago [2], there is not a solution to this long and growing issue yet. Despite
that EDs are under this overcrowding phenomena, they suﬀered budget reductions. Therefore, new techniques and
paradigms should be found in order to deal with such overcrowded condition. ED managers require diﬀerent and fresh
solutions, because society demands not only care, quality and service, but also the best: care, quality and service. A
direct solution to this issue is increasing the size of EDs. However, this straightforward solution is limited by facility,
number of staﬀ and services, and it is not the best approach. Also, healthcare managers have to maximize the use of
healthcare resources, whereas being constrained by limited budget, in order to minimize patient LOS, while increase
satisfaction of the patients, i.e. to optimize the performance of the ED.
This article presents the results of an ongoing project that is being carried out by the Research Group in Individual
Oriented Modeling (IoM) in the University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB), with the participation of the ED managers
of the Hospital of Sabadell. The general objective is to develop a simulator that, used as a decision support system
(DSS), aids the managers of EDs in setting up strategies, and management guidelines to enhance the eﬃciency of
such EDs. The main objective of this work is to optimize the number of staﬀ members of EDs, including admission
staﬀ, triage nurses, and doctors. This is a multidimensional problem (speciﬁcally, three dimension up to now). The
optimization problem has the following equation (1):
max / min
subject to

f (x)
x∈C

(1)

where x is the variable, f is a function ( f : C → R), C is the constraint set, and ∃x0 ∈ C such that f (x0 ) ≤ f (x), ∀x ∈ C
for minimization, and f (x0 ) ≥ f (x), ∀x ∈ C for its counterpart, maximization. x is discrete, global sampling of x is
possible, and f (x) at any x ∈ C cannot be evaluated exactly, and must be estimated via a simulation procedure. The
goal of the optimization procedure is to identify the staﬀ members of EDs that optimize its performance, which needs
to be estimated via a simulation due to the complexity of EDs. Optimization via simulation is a diﬃcult task [3]. As
simulations are usually computationally expensive, that even estimating f (x) at a single point x ∈ C in equation (1)
may require substantial eﬀort, this implies that only few alternatives would be explored.
The Emergency Department model deﬁned herewith is a pure Agent-Based Model (ABM), and so is formed
entirely of the rules governing the behavior of the individual agents which populate the system, no higher level
behavior is modeled. The system behavior emerges as a result of local level actions and interactions. This model
describes the complex dynamics found in an ED, representing each individual and system as an individual agent.
The rest of this article is organized as follows; section 2 describes the related works. The emergency department
model is succinctly described in section 3, while the results of simulation optimizations are given in section 4. Finally,
the conclusions and future work are presented in section 5.
2. Previous works
In 1979 computer simulation was applied to hospital systems to improve the scheduling of staﬀ members [4], and
in [5] the aim was to quantify the impact that the amount of staﬀ members, and beds had on patient throughput time.
Moreover, a survey of discrete-event simulation in healthcare clinics was presented in [6].
Although, discrete-event simulation is widely used in simulating healthcare systems, agent technology is a good
option to be used in healthcare applications, because it characterizes better the operation of complex systems as EDs.
There is a relevant article which uses ABM to simulate the workﬂow in ED [7]. It focus on triage and radiology
process, but not real data is used, the acuity of patients are not consider, and healthcare providers do not always serve
patients in a ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve basis. Simulation optimization is used to improve the operation of ED in [8], using a
commercial simulation package, and [9] combines simulation with optimization, which involves a complex stochastic
objective function under deterministic and stochastic set of restrictions. Previous works modeling healthcare systems
have focused on patient scheduling under variable pathways and stochastic process durations, the selection of an
optimal mix for patient admission in order to optimize resource usage and patient throughput [10]. Work has been
performed evaluating patient LOS under the eﬀects of diﬀerent ED physician staﬃng schedules, and the only one

1466

found until now that utilizes real data is [11] or patient diversion strategies [12]. An evolutionary multiobjective
optimization approach is using for dynamic allocation of resources in hospital practice [13], while in [14] it was
found that combining agent-based approaches and classical optimization techniques complement each other.
This proposal addresses many of the issues surrounding the modeling and simulation of a healthcare emergency
department using agent-based paradigm, where the eﬃciency of agents in this area has not been totally explored yet.
The basic rules governing the actions of the individual agents are deﬁned, in an attempt to understand micro level
behavior. The macro level behavior, that of the system as a whole, emerges as a result of the actions of these basic
building blocks, from which an understanding of the reasons for system level behavior can be derived [15].

3. Agent-based model of the emergency department
In this section, a brief description of the proposed Agent-Based Model (ABM) is presented. The Emergency
Department model deﬁned by this work is a pure ABM, thus it is formed entirely of the rules governing the behavior of
the individual agents which populate the system, no higher level behavior is modeled. The system behavior emerges
as a result of local level actions and interactions. This model describes the complex dynamics found in an ED,
representing each individual and system as an individual agent. Two distinct kinds of agents have been identiﬁed,
active and passive. Active agents represent the individuals involved in the ED, in this case all human actors, such
as patients and ED staﬀ (admission staﬀ, nurses, doctors, etc). Passive agents represent services and other reactive
systems, such as the information technology (IT) infrastructure or services used for performing tests. Moore State
machines are used to represent the actions of each agent. This takes into consideration all the variables that are
required to represent the many diﬀerent states that such individual (a patient, a member of hospital staﬀ, or any other
role) may be in throughout the course of their time in a hospital emergency department. The change in these variables,
invoked by an input from an external source, is modeled as a transition between states.
In some speciﬁc cases the state machine involves probabilistic transitions, where a given combination of current state
and input has more than one possible next state. Which transition is made is chosen at random at the time of the
transition, weights on each transition provide a means for specifying transitions that are more or less likely for a
given individual. Probabilities may be diﬀerent for each agent, in this way heterogeneity is provided to agents as
people, since agent behavior can be probabilistically deﬁned external to their state. The communication between
individuals is modeled as the inputs that agents receive and the outputs they produce, both implicitly and explicitly.
The communication model represents three basic types of communication. First type is 1-to-1 communication, such
as between two individuals, for instance admission staﬀ and patient, where a message has a single source and a
single destination. Second type is 1-to-n communication, where a message has a single source and a speciﬁc set
of recipients, for example when a doctor communicates with both patient and his companion. The last type is 1to-location communication, where a message has a single source, but it is received by every agent within a certain
area or location. This occurs when triage nurse call send a message to the patients of the waiting room, through the
loudspeaker system. In order to control the agent interaction, the physical environment in which these agents interact
also has to be modeled, being suﬃcient do it as a series of interconnected areas, such as admissions, triage box, the
waiting room, and consultation suits. The entire description of the emergency department model using Agent-based
paradigm can be found in [16].
4. Optimization
4.1. Description of the problem
The optimization problem, stated in equation (2), considered in this paper aims to ﬁnd the best ED staﬀ conﬁguration: doctors (D), triage nurses (N), and admissions (A), each of them has two levels of expertise: low and high,
labeled as Junior (J) and Senior (S), respectively. Juniors will require more time to ﬁnish their own duty than Seniors,
while Seniors have higher salaries. Time, and salary of each type, and the amount of them -from 1 up to 3 or 4- are
shown in the Table 1. This represents a combinatorial or multidimensional problem (where each variable or in this
case ED staﬀ member represents one dimension -three dimension up to now, plus the patients arrival, i.e., the input to
the ED). The optimization problem has the following equation:

where x is the variable, f is a function ( f : C → R), C is the constraint set, and ∃x0 ∈ C such that f (x0 ) ≤ f (x), ∀x ∈ C
for minimization, and f (x0 ) ≥ f (x), ∀x ∈ C for its counterpart, maximization. x is discrete, global sampling of x is
possible, and f (x) at any x ∈ C cannot be evaluated exactly, and must be estimated via a simulation procedure. The
objective is to identify the staﬀ members of EDs that optimize its performance. The expected value of the latter needs
to be estimated via simulation due to the complexity of EDs.

Such combinatorial problem is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a shows it for doctors, while Figure 1b and Figure 1c
shows it for nurses and admission personnel, respectively, that can take a lot of time to be solved. This implies that
speciﬁc conﬁgurations have to be simulated several times, changing parameters to show diﬀerent probabilities, for the
purpose of generate set of results from which particular eﬀects can be concluded. In this initial approach the search
of the optimum was done through an exhaustive search technique, even though it implies a lot of search time, it is
guaranteed that the optimum is found.

The simulator for this work is implemented by the agent-based simulation environment NetLogo [17]. The simulator is used as a black box, even though the more realistic the simulator is, the better results, and optimizations
are. The present scenario adopted for the experiments is to simulate patients moving through a simpliﬁed ED that
includes four primary areas: admissions, 3 triage boxes, 2 waiting rooms, and the 4 diagnosis and treatment boxes.
For simplicity, only four diﬀerent types of active agents are considered: patients, admission staﬀ, nurses, and doctors.
ED staﬀ considered characteristics are shown in Figure 1. In order to validate the simulator, basic patient attributes
were set as well as simple patient ﬂow was deﬁned as follows: Patients arrive to the ED on their own, and waits to
be attended in the admission area. Then, patients stay in the ﬁrst Waiting Room (WR), WR1, until a triage nurse call

1468

them. After the triage process patients pass to a second WR2, and stay there until a free doctor calls them to begin
the diagnosis and treatment, depending on the patient’s symptoms and physical condition, as well as prescribed tests.
At the end, patients are discharged from the ED. Even though realistic treatment is based on the acuity of patients, in
this simulation patients have the same path throughout the ED. In this experiment a constant arrival patient pattern has
been considered for simplicity. Patients arrive to the ED after a certain time step, and with diﬀerent probabilities from
20 to 80% (P). These probability values were used to resemble the randomness of the incoming patients to the EDs.
Even with this very reduced setting of an ED the search space is large. The search space has 4,536 (which results
of assuming a combination of two level of expertise -Junior or Senior- of up to 4 doctors, 3 nurses, 3 admissions
[showed in Figure 1], and 4 diﬀerent probabilities of patients arrival, i.e., 14 × 9 × 9 × 4) combinations to ﬁnd out
which is the best or optimum that minimize a desire index, under some restrictions. The period simulated was 24 hrs.,
one day, which represent 24,000 ticks for all the experiments, as well as the same random seed, and an average input
of 400 patients, which is the average incoming patient that the heads of ED of the Hospital of Sabadell (HS) have
reported.
In order to evaluate the utility of the proposed Agent-Based ED simulator for optimizing the resources of HS’s
ED an index deﬁned as the minimum patient LOS in the latter, with a budget of 3,500 e per patient, was set. All
simulations were done using the simulator already explained, using the BehaviorSpace tool, serially and using an IBM
cluster, which has 32 compute nodes with 2 x Dual-Core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 5,160 running at 3.00 GHz, with 12
GB of RAM, and 4MB of L2 share cache (2x2).
4.2. Experiment
The objective of the mentioned index is to minimize patient LOS in the ED, with budget constraint less or equal
to 3,500 e. This cost restriction is form by the salary of each sanitarian staﬀ that constitutes the corresponding
conﬁguration and can be represented as follows: Cost = βi j × λi j ; where β = person and λ = salary, i = D, N, A
and j = S , J. Thus, such index is expressed mathematically in equation (3).

f (D, N, A)

Cost ≤ 3, 500

(3)

The results are shown in Figures 2, and 3; where the blue points are the staﬀ conﬁguration that satisfy the constraint, while the green and red points are the minimum for each case. Each staﬀ conﬁguration that got the minimum
is presented in Figures 2c, 2d, 3c, and 3d, as well as the cost of such staﬀ conﬁguration.
From Figures 2a and 2c, there are three diﬀerent staﬀ conﬁgurations that got the minimum time, but with diﬀerent
cost. Also, in the same Figure 2a it can be appreciated that there are many other staﬀ conﬁgurations that are quite
close to the minimum time, but with less cost.
In the other cases, where the patient arrival increases, i.e., has higher probability, there are only few staﬀ conﬁgurations around the minimum, or clearly only one. Not only does the patient arrival increase, but also the minimum
average patient LOS, as expected, as well as the cost of the staﬀ conﬁguration, and also the standard deviation of the
average patient LOS. The amount of patients increases at waiting rooms, both WR1 and WR2 at times t1, t2, t3, and
t4 (each time represents every 6,000 ticks of simulation), and ﬁnally the amount of unattended patients increases as
well. In Table 2 all these results are shown. It is noticed that when the patient arrival is high, 80%, patients in waiting
rooms increase, i.e., the ED became overcrowded.

It is worth pointing out that each of the plotted points were obtained running the simulator as many times as points
are, i.e., for each case the optimum red and green points were obtained through exhaustive search technique, which

1470

Eduardo Cabrera et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1464 – 1473

implies that all the scenarios that satisfy the restrictions should be executed on the simulator. This implies a lot of
computing time, even though parametric executions, through NetLogo’s BehaviorSpace tool were used. Therefore,
when an entire and not simplify ED is used the number of cases that have to be test, through exhaustive search, will
be extensive. In order to reduce computational cost an intelligent search, other than exhaustive, must be used.
4.3. Proposed reduced scheme
Notice in Figures 2a and 2b that there are diﬀerent staﬀ conﬁgurations that got the minimum time, but with
diﬀerent cost, as well as that there are many other staﬀ scenarios that are quite close to the minimum time, but with
less cost, i.e., these other solutions are suboptima. On the other hand, where the patient arrival increases, there are
only few staﬀ conﬁgurations around the minimum, as can be seen in Figures 3a and 3b.
Taking these results into account, that exist conﬁgurations lying nearby the region where the optimum is, such
conﬁgurations or scenarios are located inside the red ellipses in Figures 2 and 3. The red ellipses delimits a region,
which is not only where the optimum is, but also where suboptima can be found, and some of such suboptima could
be selected instead of the optimum with a little less LOS, but with cheaper cost.
The mentioned regions were identify visually through Figures 2 and 3, that can be summary in Figure 4. In this
ﬁgure the blue points that lie in the red parabola delimit a wide region where diﬀerent conﬁgurations yield diﬀerent
LOS with huge diﬀerent cost, i.e., the region is wide and there are no many points nearby the minimum. On the
contrary, the green curve and the blue points in it represent a broad region with many points nearby the optimum.
These other points are suboptima which can be accepted as a solution to the posed optimization problem.
It was identiﬁed that ordering simulation points (ordered by ticks or weighted pipeline time (t∗ ) of staﬀ conﬁguration), before plotting it resembles the operation of a pipeline. The ordered and non-ordered data, using equation
(4), are shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5. Thus, a computationally simpliﬁed model of ED as a pipeline scheme was implemented in order to verify this assumption. The pipeline scheme proposed is described as follows: patients continue
arriving to the service, when only one admission personnel, nurse and doctor are available; therefore, the ED can be
seen as a single queue system, whereas when more than one staﬀ is available, patients are served as if they are in many
parallel servers. When the pipeline is full, i.e., all sanitarian staﬀ (admission personnel, nurses and doctors are busy )
and the previous queues of triage and diagnostic are occupied, then every certain ticks one patient is discharge from
the ED (ideally, because it depends on patient’s acuity). This weighted pipeline time (t∗ ) can be expressed as follows:
Pipeline time t∗ =

Figure 4: Two diﬀerent curves where clearly exists only one optimum in the red parabola, while in the green curve
there are points nearby the optimum, i.e., they are suboptima.
Therefore, the proposal is to use a computationally simpliﬁed model of ED which consists of pipelines, i.e., the
ED can be viewed as a set of pipelines connected among them. This can be observed in Figure 5. This alternative
option to ﬁnd the optimum, or the region where the optimum is, can lead us to ﬁnd out the optimum or suboptimum
values in an intelligent strategy, reducing the computing time and the region where the optimum lies. Once the region
has been found using this scheme, the Agent-Based ED simulator can be executed exhaustively on it.

In Figure 6 a scattered 3D graph of the Figure 2a is shown. From this graph nothing can be concluded about
a region where the optimum and suboptimum are, while the same data but previously ordered according to the ﬁrst
column of the Tables 3, 4 and 5 and obtained through the computationally simpliﬁed model of ED, the pipeline
scheme, is shown in the Figure 7. In this graph a region, where the optimum and suboptima are, is clearly identiﬁed.
In this region an exhaustive but reduced search is done, in order to ﬁnd out the optimum using an intelligent strategy.

5. Conclusions and future work
This paper presents a concrete example that uses a promising approach of an Agent-Based Model to simulate
Healthcare Emergency Departments (ED), whose complexity and dynamic nature make them diﬃcult to characterize.
The model uses Moore state machines based agents which act and communicate within a deﬁned layout. In order to
verify and validate the model an initial simulation has been made. An index deﬁned as the minimum patient length
of stay (LOS) was set to evaluate the operation of the Agent-Based Emergency Department simulator. The search of
the optimum LOS was done through an exhaustive search technique, which implies a large of searching time. The
obtained results are encouraging, since they not only showed that as expected, the larger number and experienced ED
staﬀ, the less average patient LOS is estimated, but also showed interesting results when its standard deviation is analyzed. Simulation allows to understand and analyze better the problem. However, even with pretty small problem size
studied the amount of combinations are large, as well as the execution time. Moreover, the resources that this problem
will demand in order to perform statistical sensitivity analysis are huge. Therefore, a better approach optimization,
rather than exhaustive search technique, must be used. This approach is using a computationally simpliﬁed model of
ED, as a pipeline scheme. The results using such an approach are not only promising, but also computationally not as
intense as the computing using exhaustive search technique.
As future work, the proposed alternative methodology pipeline scheme has to be tested with a more detailed ED
facility, as well as more sanitarian staﬀ and more realistic budget. Moreover, due to the multidimensional nature of
the problem, i.e., large amount of individuals as well as the number of states in the state machine of each individual,
diﬀerent time periods, and the multiobjective optimization problem a large amount of parameter values should be
computed; therefore, the use of High Performance Computing will be mandatory.
