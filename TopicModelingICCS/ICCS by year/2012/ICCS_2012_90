Abstract
We discuss several time integration techniques of system of ordinary diﬀerential equations characterized by strong
nonlinear coupling of the unknown variables. This system is a result of spatial discretization (using such as ﬁnite element, ﬁnite diﬀerence, or ﬁnite volume element) of the Richards Equation which is a governing mathematical principle
for modeling water inﬁltration through a subsurface. The nature of Richards Equation is further complicated by the
fact that the rate of change of the quantity of interest represented by a time derivative is also nonlinear. We formulate
a general framework of the numerical time integration as a discontinuous Galerkin method. The actual implementation of a particular scheme is realized by imposing certain ﬁnite element space in time variable to the variational
equation and appropriate ”variational crime” in the form of numerical quadrature for calculating the integration in the
formulation. The resulting nonlinear algebraic equations are solved by employing some ﬁxed point type iterations.
We discuss two examples and compare their performance.

1. Richards Equation
Flow through porous media has been of interest to people in many ﬁelds of engineering, agricultural and chemical
sciences. In many problems, a porous medium is occupied by more than one ﬂuids that are immiscible, i.e., they are
only slightly soluble or completely non-soluble. Consequently, each of these ﬂuids have to be treated individually
as diﬀerent phases. Also the pressure of each phase is related by the capillary pressure. This is the basic reason for
describing the ﬂow in unsaturated zone as a multiphase system. The loose and solid matrices represent the spatially
ﬁxed subsystem, while the void volume ( sometimes referred to as pore space ) that contain gas and/or liquids represent
the mobile subsystem whose movement/ﬂow we want to analyze. It has been known that this system is subject to both
spatial and temporal variations, and the complexity of the nature results in coupling of the physical and chemical
processes.
We are interested in modeling the ﬂow of water into a porous medium whose pore space is ﬁlled with air and some
water. Several terminologies are in order. The fraction of the pore space volume to the porous medium total volume
is called porosity, which is denoted by φ. The amount of water ﬁlling in the pore space of the medium is represented
by the water saturation, S , i.e., it is deﬁned as the fraction of the total pore space that is ﬁlled with water. In this
connection, we say that the saturation varies between two values, namely, the residual water saturation, S r , and the
fully saturated value, S s . These parameters are speciﬁc to diﬀerent porous medium. Another measure of the amount

of water in a porous medium that is closely related to water saturation is the so called volumetric water content, θ.
The variable θ is deﬁned as the fraction of porous medium total volume that is ﬁlled with water. In other words, the
volumetric water content is related to the water saturation by θ = φS .
The water ﬂow into the porous medium is driven by the pressure gradient which is characterized by the empirical
relation known as the Darcy’s Law, which is a proportionality statement of the pressure gradient to the velocity vector.
In the disciplines of hydrology and soil science, it is a common practice to use the term water pressure head h which
is deﬁned as the amount of energy per unit weight of water. Thus, h = p/ρg, where p is the pressure, ρ is water
density and g is the gravity acceleration. This normalization gives the pressure head h a dimension of length. Hence,
the Darcy’s Law is written as follows:
q = −K∂z (h − z),
(1)
where q is the velocity vector, and K is called the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity coeﬃcient, which indicates the
ability of the porous medium to transmit water under hydraulic gradients in unsaturated condition. The variable z
represents the inﬂuence of gravity to the ﬂow.
The following assumptions were proposed by Richards in [1] to give a simpliﬁed model for the ﬂuid motion in
unsaturated zone:
1. The porous medium and water are incompressible.
2. The temporal variation of the water saturation is signiﬁcantly larger than the temporal variation of the water
pressure.
3. Air phase is inﬁnitely mobile so that the air pressure remains constant, in this case it is atmospheric pressure
which equals zero.
4. Neglect the source/sink terms.
The equation is written as follows:
⎧
⎪
⎪
∂t θ(h) − ∂z K(h) ∂z (h − z) = 0, in (0, L), t > 0,
⎪
⎪
⎪

h(L, t) = hD (t),
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩h(z, 0) = h0 (z), z ∈ (0, L).

Constitutive relations between θ and h, and between K and h are developed appropriately, which consequently
gives nonlinearity behavior to Equation (2). The relation between the water content and pressure head is referred to as
moisture retention function. Equation (2) is called the coupled form of Richards Equation. In many other literatures
this equation is also called the mixed form of Richards Equation. Reliable approximation of these relations are in
general tedious to develop and thus also challenging. Field measurements or laboratory experiments to gather the
parameters are relatively expensive, and furthermore, even if one can come up with such relations from these works,
they will be somehow limited to the particular cases under consideration.
Perhaps the most widely used empirical constitutive relations for the moisture content and hydraulic conductivity
is due to the work of van Genuchten [2]:
θ(h) =

(θ s − θr )
(1 + (α|h|)n )1−1/n

+ θr and K(h) =

K s 1 − (α|h|)n−1 (1 + (α|h|)n )−1+1/n

2

,

(1 + (α|h|)n )1−1/n

which he developed by proposing a method of determining the functional relation of relative hydraulic conductivity
to pressure head by using the ﬁeld observation knowledge of the moisture retention. In turn, the procedure would
require curve-ﬁtting the proposed moisture retention function with the experimental/observational data to establish
certain parameters inherent to the resulting hydraulic conductivity model. Other simpler model, for example, was
introduced by Haverkamp et al. [3]:
θ(h) =

α (θ s − θr )

+ θr and K(h) =

Furthermore, in an attempt to formulate analytical solution of Richards Equation, several researchers have employed
exponential hydraulic parameters model to linearize the equation and applied some mathematical transformation to
obtain the solution (see for example [4], and [5]) such as
θ(h) = θ s exp(αh) and K(h) = K s exp(βh).
Although this approach may be very restrictive in practice, it can be used to verify many numerical models.
Richards Equation is categorized as a nonlinear parabolic partial diﬀerential equation with a single degeneracy
at h = 0. There have been a great deal of eﬀorts and investigations dedicated to Richards Equation. It ranges from
analyses of its mathematical properties, existence of solution, analytical and semi-analytical solutions with several
restrictive conditions, to its numerical approximations along with the proposed algorithms. Richards Equation enjoys
the property of obeying the maximum principle [6], which is desirable for those who seek its numerical approximation.
Most of the earlier studies of existence and uniqueness of Richards equation solution were implemented by assuming that the hydraulic conductivity is a power of the water content θ. Gilding and Peletier [7], for example, proposed
some criteria for the weak solution of a one dimensional problem of Richards Equation written in terms of water retention θ, and showed its existence and uniqueness. The physical interpretation of this weak solution behaviors were
investigated by Gilding in [8]. In particular, he showed the existence of the wetting front that serves as interface between adjacent wet and dry regions of a porous medium. The singularity of the wetting front were further studied and
proved by Nakano in [9]. The regularity of the weak solution of multidimensional Richards Equation was investigated
by Aronson in [6], which he showed to be Holder continuous.
Several researchers have also tried to ﬁnd analytical solutions of one dimensional Richards Equation. Perhaps,
the most classical results used and quoted in engineering ﬁelds are due to Gardner [10]. In his paper, he proposed an
exponential and power relation of the hydraulic conductivity to the water saturation, such that a steady state solution
may be obtained. Warrick and his associates [5, 11] studied analytical solutions of Richards Equation for time-varying
inﬁltration problems. Similar to Gardner, they also assumed exponential constitutive relations. Their solution takes
the form of the time integration of the well known error function. Analytical solutions of problems in layered soils
were examined in [4]. In this paper, Srivastava et al. used the exponential constitutive relations to express the partial
diﬀerential equation in terms of hydraulic conductivity K. Then, they employed the Laplace transform and inverse
transform to obtain the solution.

The analytical solutions mentioned above are restrictive in nature and also limited to one dimensional problem.
For more realistic cases, analytical solutions are in general not available. Consequently, numerical treatments are
required to tackle the problems. The ﬁnite element, ﬁnite volume, and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods are most commonly
used to generate the discretized equation. Results in [12, 13, 3, 14, 15] are several of the many works in numerical
approximations of the equation.
In this paper, we discuss several time integration techniques of system of ordinary diﬀerential equations obtained
from spatial discretization of Richards Equation. We formulate a general framework of the numerical time integration
as a discontinuous Galerkin method. The actual implementation of a particular scheme is realized by imposing certain
ﬁnite element space in time variable to the variational equation and appropriate ”variational crime” in the form of
numerical quadrature for calculating the integration in the formulation. The resulting nonlinear algebraic equations
are solved by employing some ﬁxed point type iterations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a spatial discretization of Richards Equation using
ﬁnite volume method. Section 3 describes the time discretization of the semi-discrete system in which discontinuous
Galerkin in time variable is formulated. A set of numerical examples is given in Section 4. Finally, we give an outlook
and future work in Section 5.
2. A Semi-Discrete Approximation by Finite Volume Method
For the domain (0, L), we consider a discretization T consisting of intervals τi = [zi−1 , zi ], i = 1, · · · , m such that
[0, L] = ∪m
i=1 τi . The ﬁnite volume approximations rely on a local conservation property associated with the diﬀerential
equation obtained from integrating the ﬁrst equation in (2) over any region V = [zl , zr ] ⊂ (0, L) and using integration
by parts:

The approximate solution is sought in the piecewise linear ﬁnite element space
W = w ∈ C(0, L) : w|τ is linear ∀τ ∈ T ,
with dim(W) = m. The aforementioned ﬁnite collection of subregions V are called control volumes, the number of
which is equal to the dim(W). Associated with zi , we construct the control volume as Vi = [zi−1/2 , zi+1/2 ], where zi−1/2
is the mid-point of τi−1 and zi+1/2 is the mid-point of τi+1 . We denote the set of all vertices of Z excluding the ones on
˜ ∈ W for t ≥ 0 such that
Dirichlet boundary by Z 0 . The semidiscrete ﬁnite volume element method is to ﬁnd h(t)

with h˜ 0 ∈ W a given approximation of h0 .
As with any standard semi discretization techniques, the ﬁnite volume element method (5) can be written as a
system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. In fact, let {Φi }m
i=1 be the standard “hat” basis of W, with Φi (z j ) = 1 if
˜

3. Time Discretization
To simplify presentation, we write
dt M(y) = F (y), 0 < t ≤ T, with y(0) = y˜ ,

(8)

where F (y) = A(y) y + G(y). We discretize [0, T ] into 0 = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tN = T with time steps Δtn =
tn − tn−1 and time intervals In = (tn−1 , tn ). We use an extension of the discontinuous Galerkin method [16], which
is an appropriate method for dissipative problems. The ﬁnite element approximate solutions are sought in piecewise
polynomial spaces,
V(q) = U ∈ Rm : U|In ∈ P(q) (In ), 1 ≤ n ≤ N ,
denote the left- and right-hand
where P(q) (In ) is the space of polynomial functions of degree q over In . We let U+,−
n
limits of U at tn and [U]n = U+n − U−n the jump value of U at tn . The discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element solution is
to ﬁnd Y ∈ V(q satisfying

In

dt M(Y) − F (Y), V dt + [M(Y)]n−1 , V +n−1 = 0, ∀V ∈ P(q) (In ),

(9)

for every In , n = 1, · · · , N, with Y −0 = y˜ . Here ·, · denotes the Euclidean scalar product in Rm . In what follows, we
describe two speciﬁc examples that transform (9) into computable schemes.
3.1. dG0: Piecewise Constant Approximation
We seek the approximate solution of (8) in V(0) , i.e., the ﬁnite element space in time consisting of piecewise
constant functions. Because Y +n−1 = Y −n , it follows from (9) that the approximation scheme becomes
M(Y −n ) − M(Y −n−1 ) − Δtn F (Y −n ) = 0, n = 1, · · · , N,

(10)

which is the Backward Euler diﬀerence scheme with Y −n being the unknown vector. Clearly this is a nonlinear algebraic
system of equations governing Y −n . To solve this system, a linearization technique is applied from which thereby a
ﬁxed point iteration is created. A standard approach is the Newton’s iteration: given U(0) , for κ = 1, 2, · · · , until
convergence, calculate δ(κ) and U(κ) that satisfy
M U(κ−1) − Δtn F U(κ−1) δ(κ) = − M U(κ−1) − M Y −n−1 − Δtn F U(κ−1) ,
U(κ) = U(κ−1) + δ(κ)

where all the Jacobian matrices are derived by referring to (7) and using the fact that h(y)

A variant of this iteration is to solve for δ(κ) and U(κ) that satisfy
M U(κ−1) − Δtn A(U(κ−1) ) δ(κ) = − M(U(κ−1) ) − M(Y −n−1 ) − Δtn F (U(κ−1) ) ,
U(κ) = U(κ−1) + δ(κ) ,

(14)

which can be thought of a Newton’s iteration using an approximate Jacobian matrix (see for example [13] for a similar
derivation).

to the piecewise constant approximation, the actual approximate solution of (16) is obtained by some iterative tech(0)
niques involving linearization of the original system. The Newton’s iteration is written as: given U(0) = U(0)

for κ = 1, 2, · · · , until convergence, calculate δ(κ) and U(κ) = U(κ)

The other alternative is to decouple the system by lagging behind one component which thereby creates a ﬁxed point
iteration. In particular, for κ = 1, 2, · · · , until convergence,

where Hi , for i = 1, 2, are as in (16). Of course, solving each of the components requires yet another iterative
procedure. This approach can be viewed as multi-stage iterative technique in which the iterations are decomposed
into global/outer iterations and local/inner iterations.
4. Numerical Examples
To test the time integration schemes, we use the Haverkamp model (3) to simulate the water inﬁltration on the
one dimensional soil with range [0, 40] cm. We impose a Dirichlet boundary conditions h(0, t) = −20.7 cm, and
h(40, t) = −61.5 cm, and initial condition h(x, 0) = −61.5 cm. The domain [0, 40] is discretized into 1000 uniform
intervals. The resulting semi discrete system is then integrated in time by either the dG0 scheme (10) or the dG1
scheme (16). We employ the Newton’s iteration with approximate Jacobian in each of them.
Figures 3 and 4 show comparison of the pressure head and water content proﬁles, respectively. All these proﬁles
are recorded at T = 400 sec. We have used for the comparison three diﬀerent time steps: Δt = 400 sec, Δt = 200
sec, and Δt = 80 sec. The reference solution is obtained from an overkill numerical approximation with Δt = 13 sec.
Severals observations are worth mentioning. In general, the accuracy of dG1 surpasses that of dG0. This is especially
more indicative in the right plots of the ﬁgures in which only 5 time steps are required in dG1 approximation to reach
an excellent qualitative agreement with the reference solution (obtained using 1200 time steps with dG0). Moreover,
a less dissipative characteristic of dG1 compared to dG0 is detected in the left plot of the ﬁgures which is revealed by
the overshoot in dG1 approximation. This overshoot may have been caused by the non-smooth initial condition (i.e.,
the jump at z = 0).
The second example is associated with modeling soil water redistribution process in the absence of surface evaporation. In this case, we impose the Neumann boundary conditions q(0, t) = 0 and q(40, t) = (K ◦ h)(40, t). The initial
condition is h(z, 0) = −20.7 cm for z ∈ [0, 20] and h(z, 0) = −61.5 cm for z ∈ (20, 40]. The comparison is shown
in Figures 5 and 6. The proﬁles are recorded at T = 200 sec and comparison of three diﬀerent time steps are made:
Δt = 200 sec, Δt = 100 sec, and Δt = 40 sec. As in the previous example, the reference solution is obtained from an
overkill numerical approximation with Δt = 13 sec. We observe similar characteristics to the previous examples.
5. Conclusion
In this paper we have discussed two time integration techniques for solving a semi-discrete system of Richards
Equation. The general framework of the time integration is expressed as a discontinuous Galerkin formulation from
which a particular computable scheme is derived by choosing appropriate time ﬁnite element space and quadrature
for approximating the integrations in the variational formulation. It is apparent that approximation with higher order
ﬁnite element space provides a higher level of accuracy. As attested from the numerical examples, one drawback of

higher approximation is lower dissipation property which can produce an overshooting, especially in the presence
of non-smooth initial condition. A viable remedy is to combine the lower order approximation with a higher order
counterpart in the time marching of the approximation. Typically, we can use lower order approximation at the initial
transient stage with possibly smaller time steps until the discontinuity eﬀect relatively subsides. It then proceeds with
using the higher order approximation. However, it is not immmediately clear when the switch should be done in the
process. We believe that this is where a reliable error estimation procedure can play a signiﬁcant role. We intend to
focus our future eﬀort along this direction.
