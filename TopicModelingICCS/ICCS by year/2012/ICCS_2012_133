Abstract
Quality credit has been an academic and commercial hotspot recently. This paper is mainly devoted into using a quantitative
method to evaluate credit quality. Firstly, a plain but logical indicator system of quality credit is established. Then, the classical
MCDM method TOPSIS is introduced to evaluate the credit quality of 8 air-conditioning enterprises in China market. The
discussion of evaluation results proves the feasibility and effectiveness of TOPSIS and moreover, reflects that indicators affect
the evaluation results significantly. At last, some possible further studies are mentioned.

Keywords: quality credit; TOPSIS; China; air-conditioning maket

1. Introduction
In recent years Chinese food enterprises have experienced unprecedented crisis of quality credit. The quality
credit is gradually put onto the cusp as a crucial social issue. Some related companies collapse instantly owing to
their terrible quality credit while others struggle to survive in this battle. As one of the most crucial components in
corporate credit, quality credit is then proposed to make the corporate pay more attention to the quality and credit
management. As early as 2006, Chinese government institutions have issued relative documents [1] to recommend
the framework of quality credit which gradually appears in the academic sight.
Quality credit plays significant role in enhancing the competence of the enterprise and winning the favour of
consumers. The quality credit of one enterprise or industry would also be an important reference criterion for
consumers when future decision is made. However, it has not been accepted by the academia as an accurate
concept. The inconformity of definitions and immaturity of evaluation system also restrict further understanding of
quality credit. To fix the gap, some basic elements of quality credit should be included in most definitions.
Moreover a more effective index system should also be introduced to improve the evaluation system of quality
credit.

In this paper various definitions of quality credit are discussed. Agreed indicators are aggregated to establish
the indicator system and the method of TOPSIS is introduced to evaluate the quality credit. Additionally, an
empirical experiment on air-conditioning enterprises in China market is designed to verify the feasibility and
efficiency of the evaluation system.
2. Quality credit definition and evaluation
Quality credit is first proposed as enterprise’s capacity and performance of complying with laws as well as the
commitment to its product quality by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine
(GAQSIQ) of the People’s Republic of China [1]. In 2009 the GAQSIQ and Standardization Administration of
People’s Republic of China (SAC) jointly release the recommended national standard in which the quality credit is
noted as the capacity to obtain and maintain the credit of quality [2].
The former definition is preferred in this paper, as capacity depicts an enterprise’s potential ability to manage
quality credit while performance represents the result it has achieved. Moreover the willingness to carry out the
promise of quality credit is also covered in this definition. However there exists some confusion about the definition
literally as the quality could not possess the credit as a legal entity such as a corporate or a person. The quality credit
somehow is perceived as corporate credit in terms of product quality.
The establishment of indicator system is the prerequisite of the evaluation system. Such an indicator system
should essentially represent the characters of quality credit. Previous works emphasize on the indicator selection and
classification. Sophisticated indicators have been selected aiming to extensively encompass every point mentioned
above [3]. However some redundant indicators merely increase the time to evaluate quality credit, while offering no
help to the improvement of accuracy. When it comes to the classification, most literatures prefer to break these
indicators into three different aspects, namely the willingness to maintain quality credit, capacity of the company
and practical performance.
To make the classification more precise in this paper, specific indicators are introduced to evaluate the
willingness to maintain quality credit, capacity of the company the practical performance respectively. Some
indicators are abandoned as it is improper to evaluate all companies with the same criterions. The indicators of
different industries vary as a result of different product characteristics and operation patterns. For this reason, this
paper abstracts each aspect as a logical layer and each logical layer will be embodied according to selected industry.
For the willingness to maintain quality credit, the company, law and encouragement layers are adopted. Firstly,
the company layer somehow describes the willingness of preserving tangible and intangible assets. For example, the
value of a brand is accumulated by years’ efforts and ignorance of the quality credit would lead to catastrophe that
makes these efforts in vain. Secondly, the willingness is influenced by laws and regulations. For example, the
punishment multiples by laws will increase the cost of violating the laws and corporate risk. Finally, the enterprise
will be more enthusiastic to preserve its quality credit with encouragement. For example, quality awards will
encourage the enterprise to improve its quality credit.
Capacity of the enterprise implies the potential ability to execute the quality commitment. The capacity, which
is the synthesis of product quality and corporate credit, is illustrated by the manufacturing and financial layers. The
manufacturing layer of a company includes the research investment, technical ability, quality certification and
adopted standards, which will influence the manufacturing management and eventually product quality from
different dimensions. The financial layer is analogous to part of corporate credit which is mainly concerned with
financial affairs. For example, the profit rate, sales growth and market shares are the common issues to depict
corporate capacity.
As for the practical performance, the variables are summarized as the law and customer layer. Violation of
laws will arouse suspicion about the product quality. For example, illegal records and accidents caused by terrible
product quality could devastate an enterprise’s quality credit. From the perspective of customers, practical
performance of quality credit is concerned with contract with customers. For example, the trueness of the
propaganda is the credit of promise made by the enterprise while customer’s satisfaction is the credit of execution
sensed by customers.
3. TOPSIS for quality credit evaluation
Credit evaluation is a hotspot in researches. Many mathematical models, such as support vector machine (SVM)
[4], modified SVM [5,6], decision tree, discriminant analysis, and multi-criteria quadratic programming [7-10], have

1258

Xiaoqian Zhu et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1256 – 1262

been applied. However, it is generally agreed that these models don’t perform well concerning model computing
complexity and the interpretation of results which are generally deemed to be important in credit evaluation.
Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), first developed by Hwang et al. (1981) [11],
is one of the classical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods widely used in evaluation studies for its
simplicity to explain and operate [12]. It is based on the concept that the most preferred alternative should have the
shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the largest distance from the negative ideal solution
(NIS). The PIS refers to a solution that maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the cost criteria, whereas the
NIS is the opposite, i.e. minimizes the benefit criteria and maximizes the cost criteria. The TOPSIS method
considers simultaneously the distance to both the PIS and the NIS [13].
TOPSIS is widely used in all kinds of evaluation studies, but not yet in quality credit evaluation. Therefore, in
this study, TOPSIS is used to evaluate quality credit. The quality credit of an enterprise is reflected by indicators
listed in the second section. A high quality credit enterprise should have better indicator values than the low quality
credit enterprise. So the ideal quality credit enterprise with the best indicator values and the worst enterprise with the
worst indicator values could be benchmarking for evaluating quality credit. The quality credit of an enterprise can be
represented as the distance of the enterprise from ideal enterprise and worst enterprise. The closer the enterprise to
ideal enterprise and the further to the worst enterprise, the higher quality credit score the enterprise attains, vice
verse. Some indicators, so-called benefit criteria, affect the quality credit positively while other indicators, so-called
cost criteria, affect the quality credit negatively. The ideal quality credit enterprise should have the greatest positive
indicator values and the lowest negative indicator values. The worst quality credit enterprise is just the reverse. The
quality credit scoring process using TOPSIS is as follows [14,15]:
Assume there are n enterprises to be evaluated and each enterprise has m evaluation indicators. Let X=[xij]nxm
donates decision matrix, where xij is the jth indicator value of the ith enterprise. Let wj denotes the weight of the jth
indicator.
Step1: normalize the decision matrix

criteria, otherwise vj+=min{vij, i=1,Ă,n}. vj-=min{vij, i=1,Ă,n} if jth indicator is benefit criteria, otherwise vj=max{vij, i=1,Ă,n}. PIS and NIS are the weighted normalized best and worst enterprises. Meanwhile, it is notable
that experts or regulators can also determine what the best and the worst quality credit enterprises are according to
their opinions and needs.
Step4: calculate the distance from each enterprise to PIS and NIS

TOPSIS is an attractive method in quality credit scoring because it has some notable advantages. On one hand,
it is easy to consider the expert advice based on TOPSIS. A cogent enterprise quality credit scoring is a
comprehensive evaluation process that should consider both objectively model result and subjectively expert advice.
TOPSIS can easily combine expert opinion in the following aspects. First, experts can set weights for each
evaluation indicators according to their significance. Second, experts or regulators can set what an ideal high quality
credit enterprise is, i.e. set the most preferred indicator values. Third, experts or regulators can set thresholds for
quality credit score to attain credit rating result. For example, for an percentile score, regulators can set 80, 60 as
thresholds according to their opinions, so enterprises with credit score greater than 80 are classified as grade A,
enterprise with credit score greater than 60 while less than 80 are classified as grade B, enterprise with credit score
lower than 60 are classified as grade C. On the other hand, some advice can be given to evaluated enterprises
because it is easy to explain the quality credit scoring result of TOPSIS. The comparison of each indicator value
between the evaluated enterprises and the ideal enterprise, between high score enterprises and low score enterprise
does make some sense. According the comparison, low score enterprise can realize which indicators they should
improve.

characteristics and data availability. Three aspects are considered in evaluating quality credit of air-conditioning
enterprises, i.e. willingness, capacity and performance. The three aspects are measured by 7 specific indicators
shown in table 1. All indicators are beneficial.
4.2. Data description
In this section, TOPSIS is applied to evaluate the quality credit of air-conditioning enterprises in China market.
According to customer satisfaction, 10 top enterprises consist of 8 Chinese enterprises and 2 Japanese enterprises
are chosen in this study. Two Chinese enterprises are finally abandoned owing to the lack of data. The name of the
remaining 8 enterprises are replaced by C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 for Chinese enterprises and J1, J2 for Japanese
enterprises considering data confidentiality.
According to the specific indicators in table 1, the data is shown in table 2. All indicator names in table 2 are
simplified to acronyms. Among these indicators, CWKM is attained from Chinese Well-Known Mark website [16].
RA, R&D, ISC, SM are respectively attained from annual reports 2010 and official websites of related enterprises.
MS and CS are attained from Chinese annual air-conditioning market report 2010.

Notes: Six Chinese enterprises are evaluated from all 7 indicators while the two Japanese enterprises J1 and J2 are only evaluated from the last 5
indicators, i.e. best=(6.4,18,33.86,29.75,75.7)T and worst=(1.15,12,5.82,2.42,66.7)T when evaluating J1 and J2.

4.3. Evaluation steps
In this application, the quality credit of 8 air-conditioning enterprises is to be evaluated with 7 evaluation
variables. The steps of quality credit scoring using TOPSIS are as follows:
Step1: normalize data by Eq.(1)
Step2: weight the normalized data by Eq.(2)

Weights are usually set by experts or regulators, nevertheless, in order to simplify this experiment, equal
weights are set to all indicators in this experiment, thus step2 can be skipped.
Step3: determine PIS and NIS by Eq.(3)
PIS and NIS are the normalized best and worst enterprises. The non-normalized best and worst enterprises data
is shown in the last two rows of table 2.

The best enterprise presents an inexistent enterprise in the best quality credit condition, i.e. this enterprise’s
trademark has become Chinese Well-Known Mark in the earliest year, the enterprise attains the most national
rewards, invests the most to research and development, gets ISO9000 system certification in the earliest year,
acquires the highest sales margins, owns the largest market share and meets customers’ needs at the greatest degree.
On the contrary, the worst enterprise presents an inexistent enterprise in the worst quality credit condition.
Step4: calculate the distance from the 8 enterprise to PIS and NIS by Eq.(4)
Step5: calculate the quality credit score of the 8 enterprises by Eq.(5)
The rounded quality credit scores of every enterprise are shown in the second last column of table 2. CWKM
and RA are two indicators which reflect the willingness of an enterprise to maintain credit quality, but they don’t
seem fair for the 2 Japanese enterprises in China market, so the evaluation of the two Japanese enterprises is only
from the remaining 5 indicators.
4.4. Results analysis
According to the score, the enterprises are classified into three grades. Grade A includes three good quality
credit enterprises, which are all Chinese enterprises. Grade C includes two bad enterprises, which are also Chinese
enterprises. The remaining one Chinese enterprise and the two Japanese enterprises are included in the grade B.
According to the Chinese air-condition market analysis annual report 2010 published by State Information Center of
China, three Chinese enterprises maintain the leading advantages in Chinese market. These three famous enterprises
exactly accord with the enterprises in grade A in this paper. The brands of the three enterprises are also the only
three appliance brands rated as the top 50 most valuable Chinese brands 2012 [17]. Last but not the least, the top 6
enterprises in grade A and grade B are evaluated as the global TOP 31 air-conditioning enterprises 2010 [18].
Japanese appliance enterprises are famous for their high technology and high product quality in the world, so it
is interesting that the 2 Japanese enterprises are rated as grade B but not A. It is generally assumed that sales growth
should be considered in the evaluation of quality credit. The sales growth of the 6 Chinese enterprises is all above
30% in 2010, however, that of J1 and J2 are respectively -17.55% and -6.6% If we consider sales growth in this
experiment, J1 and J2 will be rated as grade C, which is intuitively wrong. As a matter of fact, on one hand, sales
growth of air conditioner is significantly affected by the Chinese policy of home appliance subsides for rural areas
while Japanese air conditioners are not on the subsidy list. On the other hand, China is not the major market of the 2
Japanese enterprises despite the fact that they have large market share in the world. According to the China aircondition market analysis annual report 2010, the China market share of foreign enterprises in 2010 has drastically
decreased to half of that in 2005, from which we can conclude that the market share of two Japanese enterprises are
shrinking. Their marketing strategy is to sell less but high priced air conditioners in the competition with Chinese
enterprises to make more profits [19].
So adding sales growth into indicator system is not helpful for evaluating quality credit. On the contrary, it may
even confound the evaluation. Above analysis reveals that indicators are closely related to industry environment,
product characteristic, national policy and so on, so the selection of proper indicators is very important in quality
credit evaluation. More studies in quality credit are urgently needed in the future.
At last, from table 2 we can see that C1 gets the highest score because it outperforms all other enterprises. It
performs the best in 3 of the 7 evaluation indicators and the rest indicators are also close to the best. Besides, C5 and
C6 attain the lowest score with almost all of their indicators the worst, reflecting that some problems may exist the
quality credit of the enterprises. C5 and C6 are supposed to invest more fund into research and development, make
effort to acquire high quality certification, promote its sales margins, market share and so on, so as to improve its
quality credit. Other enterprises can also be analyzed in the same way. Some other indicators such as illegal results
mentioned in section two are not included in this experiment owing to lack of data. Scoring result may slightly
changes when add those indicators.
5. Conclusion
Quality credit evaluation is a relatively new research spot. In this paper, firstly the definition and evaluation
indicators of quality credit are discussed. Three aspects, willingness, capacity and performance, are used to reflect
the quality credit of an enterprise. Then the classical MCDM methods TOPSIS is used to evaluate the quality credit
of 6 Chinese and 2 Japanese enterprises in Chinese market. The evaluation result reveals that some of the Chinese

1262

Xiaoqian Zhu et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1256 – 1262

enterprises behave very well in quality credit while two Japanese enterprises are slightly inferior. At last, the
experiment result analysis proves the feasibility and effectiveness of TOPSIS in credit quality evaluation. Moreover,
using TOPSIS to evaluate quality credit has two notable advantages. One is that it is easy to consider experts’ or
regulators’ opinions based on TOPSIS, the other is that the evaluation result is easy to explain which makes it
convenient to make suggestions to enterprises.
Some further studies are also needed. The results analysis in this paper reveals that quality credit evaluation
indicators significantly affect the soundness of evaluation results, so the selection of proper indicators is very
important and needs more studies. Besides, more effective mathematical models can be applied in quality credit
evaluation.
