Abstract
Pulsating heat pipes (PHP) can be an eﬃcient solution to heat transfer problems in many applications. However,
mathematical modelling of a PHP system still has many challenging issues due to the complexity and multiphysics
nature of the system. In this paper, we use a simpliﬁed mathematical model which can still capture most of the known
physics of the two-phase heat transfer system. With appropriate approximations, we can analyze the short-time behaviour of the model and make predictions concerning the startup characteristics. We also solve the full mathematical
model using ﬁnite diﬀerence methods and compare the results with available experimental data. Comparison and
simulations show that this model can produce many important features of a real system. Potential improvements and
further research topics are also discussed.
Keywords: Asymptotic, heat transfer, mathematical modelling, oscillations, pulsating heat pipe, two-phase ﬂow.

1. Introduction
The emergence of nanotechnology and the steady increase of the density of the large-scale integrated circuits
have attracted strong interests in modelling heat transfer at very small scales, and heat management of microdevices
become increasingly important for next generation electronics and miniaturization. For example, the ITRS 22-nm
CMOS speciﬁcations for year 2016 will have a power dissipation density of about 93 W/cm2 , which is still classiﬁed
as ‘no known solution’ in terms of heat management [22]. Loop heat pipes (LHP) and pulsating heat pipes (PHP) may
provide a promising solution to such challenging problems, and thus have attracted renewed attention in recent years
[1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13].
A pulsating heat pipe is essentially a small pipe ﬁlled with both liquid and vapour and the internal diameter of the
heat pipe is at the capillary scale [1, 2]. The liquids in the pipe form segments or plugs, between vapour segments.
When encountering heat, part of the liquid many evaporate and absorb some heat, thus causing a diﬀerential pressure
and driving the movement of the plugs. When vapour bubbles meet a cold region, some of the vapour may condensate,
and thus releasing some heat. The loop can be open or closed, depending on the type of applications and design. This
continuous loop and process will form an eﬃcient cooling system if designed and managed properly for a given task.
Therefore, such systems have been applied to many applications in heat exchanger, space applications and electronics,
and they can potentially have even wider applications [23].

Though a pulsating heat pipe system looks simple, its working mechanisms are relatively complex, as it involves
multiphysics processes such as thermo-hydrodynamics, two-phase ﬂow, capillary actions, phase changes and others.
Therefore, many challenging issues still remain unsatisfactorily modelled. There are quite a few attempts in the
literature to model a PHP system with various degrees of approximation and success. In this paper, we will use a
mathematical model based on one of the best models [12, 13], and will carry out some mathematical analysis and
highlight the key issues in the state of the art models.
This paper is organized as follows: we ﬁrst brieﬂy outline the main multiphysics processes in the mathematical
models. Then, we use diﬀerent degrees of approximations to isolate diﬀerent processes and mechanisms so as to see
how strong their eﬀects may be. We then solve the simpliﬁed model numerically and compared with experimental
data drawn from the literature. Finally, we highlight the key issues and discuss possible directions for further research.
2. Mathematical Models
2.1. Key Processes
The inner diameter of a typical pulsating heat pipe should be in the range of capillary length, and many design
options suggest to use a diameter near the critical diameter [4]
dc = 2

σ
,
g(ρl − ρv )

(1)

where σ is the surface tension (N/m), while g is the acceleration due to gravity, which can be taken as 9.8 m/s2 . ρl
and ρv are the densities of liquid and vapour, respectively.
Mathematical modelling of two-phase pulsating ﬂow inside a pipe involves many processes, including interfacial
mass transfer, capillary force, wall shear stress due to viscous action, contact angles, phase changes such as evaporation and condensation, surface tension, gravity and adiabatic process. All these will involve some constitutive laws
and they will be coupled with fundamental laws of the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, and thus resulting
in a nonlinear system of highly coupled partial diﬀerential equations. Consequently, a complex model of suck kinds
can lead to complex behaviour including nonlinear oscillations and even chaotic characteristics [9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 21].
A mathematical model can have diﬀerent level of complexity, and often a simple model can provide signiﬁcant
insight into the working mechanism of the system and its behaviour if the model is constructed correctly with realistic
conditions. In most cases, full mathematical analysis is not possible, we can only focus on some aspects of the model
and gain some insight into the system.
2.2. Basic Mathematical Model and Governing Equations
In the rest of the paper, we will focus on one model which may be claimed as the state-of-the-art, as it is based on
the latest models [12, 13]. It is for a system of liquid plugs and vapour bubbles as shown in Fig. 1.
2.2.1. Temperature Evolution
The temperature T v in a vapour bubble is governed by the energy balance equation
mv cvv

dV
= −hl f v (T v − τ)Lπ(di − 2δ) − rm hv Lπ(di − 2δ) − pv

Here L is the mean plug length, di is the inner diameter of the pipe, and δ is the thickness of the thin liquid ﬁlm. h
corresponds to the heat transfer coeﬃcient and/or enthalpy in diﬀerent terms. Here σ0 is a coeﬃcient and R is the gas
constant.
In addition, the volume is given by
πd2
V = i (L + Lv ),
(4)

where the length of the vapour bubble is typically Lv = 0.02 m, and σ ≈ 1.
The temperature τ in the liquid ﬁlm is governed by
rm =

dτ
= −hl f w (τ − T w )Lπdi + hl f v (T v − τ)Lπ(di − 2δ) + rm hv Lπ(di − 2δ),
dt

(5)

where T w is the initial wall temperature.
2.2.2. Mass Transfer
For a vapour bubble, rate of change in mass is governed by the conservation of mass
dmv
= −π(di − 2δ)rm .
dt

(6)

As mv = ρv V, we have

dV
= π(di − 2δ)rm − rv πdi Lv ,
dt
where ρv ≈ 1Kg/m3 and the transfer rate rv = 0 if T w > T v .
ρv

(7)

2.2.3. Motion of a Plug
The position x p of the liquid plug is governed by the momentum equation

= (di − 2δ)2 (pv1 − pv2 ) − πdi L p sw + m p g,

(8)

where

πdi2

(L0 − x p ),

with L0 ≈ 25di and ρl = 1000 Kg/m3 . Here the term pv1 − pv2 is the diﬀerential pressure between the two sides of the
plug.
In the above equations, we also assume the vapour acts as an ideal gas, and we have
m p = ρl

pv =

mv RT v
.
V

(10)

The shear stress sw between the wall and the liquid plug is given by an empirical relationship
1
sw = C f ρl v2p ,
2

(11)

where C f ≈ 16/Re when Re = ρl v p di /μl ≤ 1180, otherwise, C f ≈ 0.078Re−1/4 . Obviously, v p = dx p /dt.
It is worth pointing out that when we write down the above equations, we have tried to incorporate most the
constitutive relationships such contact angles, capillary pressures and viscous force into the equations directly so that
we can have as fewer equations as possible. For details, readers can refer to [12, 13, 4]. This way, we can focus on a
few key equations such as the motion of a plug and temperature variations, which makes it more convenient for later
mathematical analysis.

2.3. Typical Parameters
Many ﬂuid properties can be measured directly, and there are typical values which are relevant to this study. Most
of these values are drawn from earlier studies [5, 12, 19]. Typically, we have L = 0.18 m, di = 3.3 × 10−3 m,
δ = 2.5 × 10−5 m. The initial temperature is T v ≈ τ = 20◦ C, while the initial wall temperature is T w = 40◦ C. The
initial pressure can be taken as pv ≈ 5.5816 × 104 Pa. hl f w = 1000W/m2 K, hv = 10 W/m2 K. cvl = 1900J/Kg ◦ C,
R = 8.31 and cvv = 1800J/Kg ◦ C.
Initially, we have mv0 = pv0 V0 /(Rv (T v0 + 273.15) where T v0 = 20 ◦ C, pv0 = 105 Pa, Rv = 461 J/Kg K, and
m f 0 ≈ mv0 /10.
3. Simpliﬁed Model and Analysis
In essence, the full model consists of the following equations
π
v
mv cvv dT
dt = −hl f v (T v − τ)Lπ(di − 2δ) − rm hv Lπ(di − 2δ) − pv ρv [(di − 2δ)rm − di Lv rv ],

= π4 (di − 2δ)2 (pvk − pvk ) − πdi L p sw + m p g.

In principle, we can solve this full model numerically using any suitable numerical methods such as ﬁnite diﬀerence
methods, and see how the system behaves under various conditions with various values of parameters. Preliminary
studies exist in the literature [12, 5], and we have tested our system that it can indeed reproduce these results using
the typical parameters given in Section 2.3. For example, the mean temperature in a plug is shown in Fig. 2, which is
consistent with the results in [21], while the oscillatory bahaviour in Fig. 3 is similar to the results obtained by others
[7, 4, 21, 13, 20].

3.1. Non-dimensionalized Model
Under appropriate conditions, the system can be considered stationary, and thus many terms can be taken as
constants. Then, the full mathematical model (12) can be non-dimensionalized and written as

3.2. Simpliﬁed Model
Under the assumptions of stationary conditions and x p /L0
1 (for example at the startup stage), the last equation
is essentially decoupled from the other equations. In this case, we have an approximate but simpliﬁed model
dτ

= b(T v − τ) − τ + α3 ,

(18)

For the natural condition x p = 0 at t = 0, the above equation has a short-time solution
xp =

√
1
ln cosh( AB t) ,
B

(19)

which is only valid when x p /L0 is small and/or t is small. Indeed, it gives some main characteristics of the startup
behaviour as shown as the dashed curve in Fig. 4.
Furthermore, the ﬁrst equation for the liquid plug temperature is also decoupled from the PDE system. We have
dτ
= Q1 − Q2 τ,
dt

Q1 = bT v + α3 ,

Q2 = b + .

(20)

For an initial condition τ = 0 at t = 0, we have the following solution
τ = Q1 (1 − e−Q2 t ),

(21)

which provides a similar startup behaviour as shown in Fig. 2 for small times.
A comparison of the approximation solution with the full numerical solutions and experimental data is shown in
Fig. 4. Here the experimental data was drawn from [12, 13, 4]. It is worth pointing that the approximation indeed
provides some basic characteristics of the fundamental behavoir of the startup, and the full numerical results can also
give a good indication of the ﬁnal steady-state value.
This simpliﬁed model also conﬁrms that some earlier studies using mainly x p as the dependent variable can indeed
give good insight into the basic characteristics of the complex system. For example, Wong et al. used an equivalent
viscous damping system without considering the actual heat transfer system [14], and their main governing equation
can be written as
dx
d2 x
(22)
+ a + b(k + t)x = 0,
dt
dt2
where a, b, k are constants. This system has typical features of a viscous damping system. On the other hand, Yuan et
al. used a system with primarily a second-order nonlinear ODE for x p

where C is the friction coeﬃcient. This system can have even richer characteristics of oscillatory behaviours [20].
In comparison with earlier simpler models, our simpliﬁed model can produce even richer dynamic features of the
system without using much complex mathematical analysis, thus provides a basis for further realistic analysis and
simulations.

4. Discussions
We have used one of the state-of-the-art mathematical models to analyze the main characteristics of a typical
pulsating heat pipe. To some degree, this simple 1D model can reproduce most of the known features of the system
as we have shown in this paper.
However, there are still some signiﬁcant diﬀerences between full numerical model and experimental data. This
may be attributed to three possibilities: ﬁrst, parameters used in our model may not reﬂect the real parameters in the
actual experimental settings. Second, experimental data could reﬂect a system that some processes and parameters
are not actually those that seem to represent. There may be indirect measurements and thus introducing systematic
discrepancy. For example, the liquid may be impure, and thus leading to slightly diﬀerent performance. Third, the
mathematical model does not capture all the physical processes in the pulsating heat pipe system, and thus requires
further improvements. To resolve these issues, we may need a detailed control experiment so that we know exactly
what the experimental settings and parameters are, and thus can make better comparisons. In addition, we may have
to extend our mathematical model signiﬁcantly to model the system more realistically.
There are three ways to extend the mathematical models. Firstly, we can investigate models in 2D and 3D cases.
A cylindrical symmetrical model may be a ﬁrst step, and then a fuller 3D model can be further formulated. Secondly,
a full 3D CFD simulations with realistic geometry and boundary conditions may also be fruitful. Thirdly, we should
investigate to include better physics in a realistic way. At the moment, may physical processes and constitutive laws
are simpliﬁed.
Once we have a realistic mathematical model, we can try mathematical analysis and approximation methods such
as asymptotic analysis and perturbation methods. This may provide further insight into the actual behaviour of the
heat transfer system.
In addition, some detailed parametric studies and comparison are highly needed so as to identify the most appropriate parameters or ranges of parameters in the physical system. Ultimately, we should combine modelling and
simulation with optimization techniques [15, 16]. There are many eﬃcient optimization algorithms such as ﬁreﬂy
algorithm [15], cuckoo search [18] and bat algorithm[17], which can be used to help to solve various tough design
tasks. This will enable us to not only understand the system better, but also design better PHP systems for various
applications.
