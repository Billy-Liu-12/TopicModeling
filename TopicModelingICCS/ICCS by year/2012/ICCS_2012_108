Abstract
We present a methodology to change the state of the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with
the ﬁre spread code SFIRE, based on Rothermel’s formula and the level set method, and with a fuel moisture model.
The ﬁre perimeter in the model changes in response to data while the model is running. However, the atmosphere
state takes time to develop in response to the forcing by the heat ﬂux from the ﬁre. Therefore, an artiﬁcial ﬁre history
is created from an earlier ﬁre perimeter to the new perimeter, and replayed with the proper heat ﬂuxes to allow the
atmosphere state to adjust. The method is an extension of an earlier method to start the coupled ﬁre model from a
developed ﬁre perimeter rather than an ignition point. The level set method can be also used to identify parameters
of the simulation, such as the ﬁre spread rate. The coupled model is available from openwfm.org, and it extends the
WRF-Fire code in WRF release.

1. Introduction
This article reports on recent developments in building a Dynamic Data Driven Application System (DDDAS) for
wildland ﬁre simulations [1, 2, 3]. A DDDAS is based on the ability to incorporate data into an executing simulation
[4]. See Fig. 1 for the overall scheme of the DDDAS.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we we review some existing approaches to data assimilation in
simulations of wildland ﬁres. In Sec. 3 and 4, we brieﬂy formulate the model and the principal idea of creating
and replaying artiﬁcial ﬁre history from point ignition to a given perimeter, for reference. Sec. 5 considers several
methods for the construction of a level set function, needed for the replay, two from our previous work and a new
method, which is an extension of the reinitialization equation approach known in level set methods. In Sec. 6, we
present a new method how the level set functions constructed for two perimeters can be used to create and replay

automatic adjustment of the ﬁre spread rate between the two perimeters. Sec. 7 describes a new moisture model
coupled with the ﬁre and atmosphere model, and the possibilities for the assimilation of moisture data. Finally, Sec. 8
is the conclusion.
2. Data assimilation for wildland ﬁres
One way to incorporate data into an executing simulation is by sequential statistical estimation, which takes all
available data to date into account, and is known in geosciences as data assimilation. Data assimilation is a standard
technique in numerical weather prediction, and the ability to assimilate large amounts of real-time data is behind
much of the recent improvement of weather forecast skill [5]. However, data assimilation for wildland ﬁres poses
unique challenges, and classical data assimilation methods simply will not work [6, 7, 8]. One of the reasons is that in
many other physical systems where standard methods work well, such as pollution transport or atmospheric dynamics,
unwanted perturbations tend to dissipate over time; but, in a ﬁre model, once a perturbation ignites an unwanted ﬁre,
the ﬁre will keep growing, and after few assimilation cycles, everything burns. Another reason is that a ﬁre as a
coherent structure, needs to be moved, started, or extinguished in response to the data, which requires positional,
Lagrangean correction; additive corrections of the values of the physical ﬁelds are not very useful.
Data assimilation methods by sequential Monte-Carlo methods (SMC), also known as particle ﬁlters, were
developed in the literature for cell-based ﬁre models [9, 10]. They can handle non-Gaussian distributions, but they
are computationally very expensive, because they require very large ensembles to cover a region of the state space
by random perturbations. A suitable perturbation algorithm is the key to a successful application. The perturbation
methods used in wildland ﬁre modeling range from random modiﬁcations of the burn area [9] to genetic algorithms,
which evolve the shape of the ﬁre by simulated evolution, where the states with ﬁre regions closer the the data are more
likely to survive [11]. While SMC methods with tens of thousands of particles may be feasible for 2D cell models,
with relatively small state vectors, they are deﬁnitely out of question for a coupled atmosphere-ﬁre model. Methods
based on the optimal statistical interpolation and the Kalman ﬁlter (KF), such as the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF),

assume that the state distribution is at least approximately Gaussian and they modify the state in response to data
[5, p. 180] rather than rely on hitting the right answer with random perturbations. Thus, KF-based mehods require
much smaller ensembles that SMC methods, but still in the range of 20-100 members and easily many hundreds
[12]. However, because of the ﬁne resolution of the atmospheric model needed over large areas, and the associated
need for small time steps, the simulations are computationally very demanding, and such ensembles are still out of
question. FFT-based data assimilation methods, which reduce data assimilation to eﬃcient operations with diagonal
matrices [13] and can drastically reduce the required ensemble size, from hundreds to often just 5 or 10 members.
However, using the Fourier basis is tantamount to the assumption that the state covariance does not vary spatially [14].
Wavelet estimation can combine the eﬀectiveness of spectral methods with an automatic treatment of spatial locality
[15]. Wavelet diagonal approximations of the covariance matrix [16] are of particular interest, as they allow eﬃcient
evaluation of the EnKF formulas [17].
Position correction methods, such as morphing [6], can overcome the limitations of changing the state of the
simulation by additive corrections only. These method extend the state by a new variable containing a deformation
ﬁeld, similarly as in optical ﬂow methods [19] and extraction of the wind ﬁeld from a sequence of radar images
[20]. For other related position correction methods, see, e.g., [21]. Our morphing technique is distinguished by
replacing linear combinations of member states, which are at the heart of, e.g., the EnKF, by intermediate states,
which interpolate both the magnitude and the position of coherent features, such as ﬁres. Time series of station
observations could be handled by considering composite states over several time steps. However, while morphing
works successfully for ﬁre models [6, 8], it changes the delicate physical balance of the atmospheric equations and
limits the possibility of the treatment of the model as a black box. Even a simple linear transformation to move
and reshape the vortex in hurricane forecasting needs rebalancing of the atmospheric variables from conservation
equations [22, p. 11].
Therefore, an important problem in data assimilation for a coupled atmosphere-ﬁre model is how to adjust the
atmosphere state when the state of the ﬁre model changes in response to data. The heat output of the ﬁre is concentrated
in a narrow area with active combustion, therefore the ﬁre forcing on the atmosphere is highly localized. If the ﬁre

Jan Mandel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1100 – 1109

1103

is just shifted, a position correction alone can be successfull to some extent [6, 8] because the relationship between
the changes in the atmosphere and in the ﬁre is captured in the covariance of their deformation ﬁelds. However, in
general, the covariance does not contain suﬃcient information and a spin-up is required to develop proper circulation
patterns for the changed ﬁre forcing.
3. The coupled atmosphere – ﬁre model
Over time, the wildland ﬁre DDDAS has evolved from a simple convection-reaction-diﬀusion equation exploratory
model to test data assimilation methodologies [23] and the CAWFE model [24, 25], which couples the Clark-Hall
atmospheric model with ﬁre spread implemented by tracers (Lagrangean particles), to the currently used Weather
Research Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale atmospheric code [26] coupled with a spread model implemented by the level
set method [8, 27]. The Clark-Hall model has many favorable properties, such as the ability to handle reﬁnement, but
WRF is a supported community model, it can execute in parallel, and has built-in export and import of state, which is
essential for data assimilation. Also, WRF supports data formats standard in geosciences. The implementation by the
level set method was chosen because the level set function can be manipulated much more easily than tracers. The
coupled code is available from the Open Wildland Fire Modeling Environment (OpenWFM) [18] at openwfm.org,
which contains also diagnostic and data processing utilities, including visualization in Google Earth (Fig. 2), which
we ﬁrst proposed in [2]. A subset of the SFIRE code was released with WRF as WRF-Fire. The model is capable of
running on a cluster faster than real time with atmospheric resolution in tens of m, needed to resolve the atmosphereﬁre interaction, for a ﬁre of size over 10 km [28]. See [8, 27] for futher details and references.
The state variables of the ﬁre model are the level set function, Φ, the time of ignition T i , and the fuel fraction
remaining F, given by their values on the nodes of the ﬁre model mesh. At a given simulation time t, the ﬁre area is
represented by the level set function Φ as the set of all points (x, y) where Φ (t, x, y) ≤ 0. Since the level set function
is interpolated linearly between nodes, this allows a submesh representation of the ﬁre area. In every time step of the
simulation, the level set function is advanced by one step of a Runge-Kutta scheme for the level set equation
dΦ
= −R |∇Φ| ,
dt

(1)

where R = R (t, x, y) is the ﬁre rate of spread and |·| is the Euclidean norm. The ignition time T i = T i (x, y) is then
computed for all newly ignited nodes, and it satisﬁes the consistency condition
Φ (t, x, y) ≤ 0 ⇐⇒ T i (x, y) ≤ t,

(2)

where both inequalities express the condition that the location (x, y) is burning at the time t.
The ﬁre rate of spread R is given by the Rothermel’s formula [29] as a function of the wind speed (at a height
dependent on the fuel) and the slope in the direction normal to the ﬁreline. From the level-set representation of the
ﬁreline at the time t as Φ (t, x, y) = 0, it follows by an easy calculus that the normal direction is ∇Φ/ |∇Φ|, where |·| is
the Euclidean norm. Thus,
∇Φ
R=R u·
,
(3)
|∇Φ|
where u is the wind ﬁeld.
Once the fuel starts burning, the remaining mass fraction F = F(t, x, y) is approximated by exponential decay,
F (t, x, y) =

i (x,y)
exp − t−T
T f (x,y) ,
1,

t > T i (x, y) ,
t ≤ T i (x, y) ,

(4)

where T f is the fuel burn time, i.e., the number of seconds for the fuel to burn down to 1/e ≈ 0.3689 of the starting
fuel fraction F = 1. The heat ﬂuxes from the ﬁre to the atmosphere are taken proportional to the fuel burning rate,
∂F (t, x, y) /∂t. The proportionality constants are fuel coeﬃcients. The heat ﬂuxes from the ﬁre are inserted into the
atmospheric model as forcing terms in diﬀerential equations of the atmospheric model in a layer above the surface,
with exponential decay with altitude. This scheme is required because atmospheric models with explicit timestepping,
such as WRF, do not support ﬂux boundary conditions. The sensible heat ﬂux is added to the time derivative of the
temperature, while the latent heat ﬂux is added to the derivative of water vapor concentration.

Figure 3: Creating artiﬁcial time history by proportions. The ignition times at the ignition point A and the ﬁre
perimeter Γ are interpolated linearly along the segment between A and a point B on Γ to a mesh point X.
4. Replaying artiﬁcial ﬁre history
The SFIRE code as presented in [8, 27] starts from one or more ignition points. The release of the heat from
the ﬁre then gradually establishes atmospheric circulation patterns and the ﬁre evolves in an interaction with the
atmosphere. There is, however, a practical need to start the simulation from an observed ﬁre perimeter, and to modify
the ﬁre perimeter in a running simulation, which presents a particular problem in a coupled model. The atmospheric
circulation due to the ﬁre takes time to develop and the heat release from the ﬁre model needs to be gradual, or the
model will crash due to excessive vertical wind component.
Therefore, we have proposed creating and replaying an approximate ﬁre history, leading to the desired ﬁre
perimeter [30]. Replying the ﬁre history allows for graduate release of the combustion heat and allows the atmospheric
circulation patterns due to the ﬁre to develop. The ﬁre history is encoded as an array of ignition times T i (x, y),
prescribed at all ﬁre mesh nodes. To replay the ﬁre, the numerical scheme for advancing Φ is suspended, and instead
the level set function is set to
Φ (t, x, y) = T i (x, y) − t.
(5)
The fuel decay (4) is then computed from T i , and the resulting heat ﬂuxes are inserted into the atmosphere. After the
end of the replay period is reached, the numerical scheme of the level set method takes over.
5. Creating a level set function from a given ﬁre perimeter
A ﬁre perimeter is considered as a closed curve Γ, composed of linear segments, and given as a sequence of the
coordinates of the endpoints of the segments. In practice, such geospatial data are often provided as a GIS shapeﬁle
[31], or encoded in a KML ﬁle, e.g., from LANDFIRE.
In [30], we have proposed a simple scheme for creating an artiﬁcial ﬁre history to be used in the ﬁre replay
scheme (5): given an ignition point and ignition time at that point, approximate ignition times T i at the mesh points
are established by linear interpolation between the ignition point and the perimeter (Fig. 3). This simple method was
already shown to be successful in starting the model from the given perimeter in a simple idealized case (Fig. 4), with
the error in the wind speed of only few %. Extensions of the artiﬁcial history scheme will be needed for domains
which are not star-shaped with respect to the ignition point. Running the ﬁre propagation backwards in time to ﬁnd
an ignition point is also a possibility, with an intriguing forensic potential [30].
The ignition times T i at locations outside of the given ﬁre perimeter are perhaps best thought of as what the ignition
times at those locations might be in future as the ﬁre keeps burning.
Constructing a level set function from a perimeter is one of the basic tasks in level set methods. Given a closed
curve Γ, one wishes to construct a function L = L (x, y), such that
L > 0 outside of Γ,

L < 0 inside of Γ,

L = 0 on Γ.

(a) The diﬀerence in the horizontal wind vector (m/s).

1105

(b) The relative diﬀerence in the wind speed.

Figure 4: The diﬀerence in the horizontal wind ﬁeld at 6.1m between a simulation propagated naturally from a point
and another one advanced artiﬁcially. The ﬁrst simulation was ignited from a point in the northeast corner of the
domain, and the ﬁre perimeter was recorded after 40 minutes. This perimeter and ignition location were used to
generate an artiﬁcial history for the ﬁrst 40 minutes, which was replayed in the second simulation. Both simulations
were then allowed to advance another 28 minutes. Reproduced from [30].
In the application to perimeter ignition, one can then set at a ﬁxed instant t,
T i (x, y) = cL (x, y) + (t − T ) ,

Φ (t, x, y) = L (x, y)

where c is a scaling factor, and proceed with the replay as described in Section 4.
One commonly used level set function is the signed distance from the given closed curve Γ,
L (x, y) = ± dist ((x, y) , Γ) ,

(7)

where the sign is taken to be negative inside the region limited by Γ and positive outside [32], and dist stands for
the Euclidean distance. Surprisingly, such function cannot be deﬁned consistently once the problem is discretized.
Consider a level set function L that is given by its values on the corners of grid cells, interpolated linearly along
the grid lines, and Γ given by its intersection with the grid lines (Fig. 5). Then, the ratio of the values of L at two
neighboring mesh corners on the opposite sides of Γ is ﬁxed by the requirement that L is linear between the two
corners. In particular, it is not possible in general to deﬁne L as the signed distance (7). For example, in Fig. 5, the
ratio L (X) /L (Y) is ﬁxed and L (X) does not depend on Z, while L (Y) does.
One possibility is simply deﬁne the values of L next to Γ by the signed distance, and forget about the exact
representation of Γ as L = 0. Instead, in [33], we have proposed to ﬁnd the values of L next to Γ by least squares.
Denoting by u the vector of the values L next to Γ, it is easy to see that u satisﬁes a homogeneous system of linear
equations of the form Bu = 0 with at most two nonzeros per rows, and each row corresponding to an edge on the mesh
that is intersected by Γ, as the edge XY. We can then ﬁnd a suitable u minimizing u − d 2 subject to Bu = 0, where
d are the signed distances (7). Once the values of L near Γ are found, one can extend L to the whole domain as the
distance function by the Fast Marching Method (FMM) [34], or by a simpler and less accurate approximate method
suggested in [33].
A better method can be obtained by taking the spread rate into account. The level set function L is a solution of
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
R | L| = 1,

L = 0 on Γ.

Figure 5: A level set function linear on the line segments connecting the nodes of the ﬁre mesh cannot be deﬁned at
the nodes X and Y consistently as the signed distance (7) from the interface Γ. The distance of the point X from Γ
does not depend on the location of the point Z, while the distance of Y does; yet the values of the level set function at
X and Y are linear along the segment XY and so ﬁxed by the ratio of their distances from W.
which can be found by solving the reinitialization equation [32, Eq. (7.4)]
∂L
= ± (1 − R | L|)
(8)
∂t
where the sign is taken positive outside of Γ and negative inside. Equation (8) is solved by upwinding formulas
moving away from Γ and starting from the values of L on the other side of Γ. Alternating the solution process between
the outside and the inside of Γ, the values of L on the two sides of Γ “balance out and a steady-state signed distance
function is obtained” [32, p. 66].
The situation here is more complicated, because the spread rate R depends on the level set function L following
(3). Hence, we freeze L inside R and use successive approximations of the form
∂Lk+1

=± 1−R u·

6. Data assimilation for the level set ﬁre spread model
Creating a level set function as in [30] and in Sec. 5 allows for starting the coupled model from a given ﬁre
perimeter instead of an ignition point. However, a more general approach is needed for data assimilation. Suppose
the ﬁre perimeter in the simulation is Γ1 at time t1 . Then at time t2 > t1 , the ﬁre evolves to ﬁre perimeter Γ2 . However,
data is assimilated, changing the state of the ﬁre model and resulting in a diﬀerent ﬁre model state with perimeter Γa .
First we construct level set functions L1 , L2 , and La for the perimeters Γ1 , Γ2 , and Γa , respectively, satisfying (6). We
assume that all three level set functions are created using the same method. The resulting approximate formulas will
be exact in the case of 1D propagation with the level set functions linear and having the same slope. They will be
used point-wise as an approximation otherwise. To emphasize the point-wise application, we write out the arguments
(x, y) when present.
6.1. Modifying the ﬁre perimeter dynamically
The state of the atmosphere will no longer match the state of the ﬁre model with the perimeter Γa , and we need to
make up the evolution of the atmosphere as the ﬁre progresses from the perimeter Γ1 to the perimeter Γa . Since Γ1 is

Jan Mandel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1100 – 1109

1107

completely contained inside Γa , in the region between Γ1 and Γa , we have L1 > 0 and La < 0. The function
f1,a (x, y) =

L1 (x, y)
L1 (x, y) − La (x, y)

(9)

then satisﬁes
f1,a = 0 on Γ1 ,

0 < f1,a < 1 between Γ1 and Γa ,

f1,a = 1 on Γ2 .

We can then use the function f1,a to create artiﬁcial ignition times by
T i (x, y) = t1 +

L1 (x, y)
(t2 − t1 )
L1 (x, y) − La (x, y)

which interpolates between the perimeters Γ1 and Γa , and replay the ﬁre history to release the heat into the atmosphere
gradually, as in Sec. 4.
6.2. Dynamic estimate of ﬁre spread rate
A common source of errors in ﬁre modeling is incorrect spread rate. The level set function construction here can
be used to adjust the spread rate as well. Deﬁne f1,2 similarly to (9),
f1,2 (x, y) =

L1 (x, y)
.
L1 (x, y) − L2 (x, y)

(10)

We now use a simple argument of proportions. Assume for the moment 1D ﬁre propagation in one direction and that
f1,a and f1,2 are linear. Then Γ1 , Γ2 , and Γa are points on the real line. and the spread rates of the simulated ﬁre and
the spread rate after the data assimilation are, respectively,
R=

Γ2 − Γ1
,
t2 − t1

f1,2 (x) =

x − Γ1
,
Γ2 − Γ1

Ra =

Γa − Γ1
.
t2 − t1

However, since f1,2 and f1,a are linear,

which gives

f1,a (x) =

f1,2 (x)
Ra (x) Γa − Γ1
,
=
=
R (x)
Γ2 − Γ1
f1,a (x)

x − Γ1
,
Γa − Γ 1
x

Γ1 .

(11)

Thus, using (9) and (10), (11) suggests to modify the given spread rate R at a point (x, y) to become the spread rate
Ra after the data assimilation, given by
Ra (x, y) =

L1 (x, y) − La (x, y)
R (x, y) .
L1 (x, y) − L2 (x, y)

(12)

7. Moisture model
Fire spread rate depends strongly on the moisture contents of the fuel. In fact, the spread rate drops to zero
when the moisture reaches the so-called extinction value. For this reason, we have coupled the ﬁre spread model
with a simple fuel moisture model integrated in SFIRE and run independently at every point of the mesh. The
temperature and the relative humidity of the air (from the WRF atmosphere model) determine the fuel equilibrium
moisture contents E [35], and the actual moisture contents m = m (t) is then modeled by the standard time-lag equation
dm E − m
,
=
dt
Td

(13)

where T d is the drying lag time. We use the standard model with the fuel consisting of components with 1, 10, and
100 hour lag time, with the proportions given by the fuel category [36], and the moisture is tracked in each component

1108

separately. During rain, the equilibrium moisture E is replaced by the saturation moisture contents S , and the equation
is modiﬁed to achieve the rain-wetting lag time T r only asymptotically for heavy rain,
r − r0
dm S − m

, if r > r0 ,

(14)

where r is the rain intensity, r0 is the threshold rain intensity below which no perceptible wetting occurs, and rs is the
saturation rain intensity, at which 1 − 1/e ≈ 63% of the maximal rain-wetting rate is achieved. The coeﬃcients can
be calibrated to achieve a similar behavior as accepted empirical models [37, 38]. See [39, 40] for other, much more
sophisticated models. If moisture measurements are available, they can be ingested in the model (13, 14) by a fast and
cheap Kalman ﬁlter in one variable, run at each point independently.
8. Conclusion
We have presented new techniques to assimilate the perimeter data at two diﬀerent times into a coupled
atmosphere-ﬁre model, a new method to estimate the adjustment of the model spread rate between the perimeters
towards the data, and a new coupling of the atmosphere-ﬁre model with a third model, a simple time-lag model of
fuel moisture. Implementation of the data assimilation is in progress. The moisture model is currently included in the
code download and will be treated in more detail elsewhere.
