Abstract

The analysis at nano-scale is important for the modeling of plastic deformation and its structures. We reviewed
algorithms at nano-scale using FEM and presented a solution for modeling of such processes and corresponding
algorithms. Also, we studied dislocations and avalanches in the deformed body, how they affect the quality, and
methods to decrease their affluence on the product. For meshing of the model proposed method is to relate particle
size and mechanical properties, which is investigated in the context of plastic deformation. Damage models
presented in the paper can be proved useful for the production modeling and manufacturing. Modeling of buckling
and plastic deformation proved to be useful to study the phenomenon and can be optimized with the proposed
methods. Numerical verification using test benchmarks were conducted to demonstrate flange buckling, its particle
measurements, and avalanches in the deformed part to validate propositions.
Keywords: Nanoscale; plasticity; fracture; avalanches.

1. Overview
One of the basic observations of material science is the existence of a well-defined yield stress. We study by
simulation, in three dimensions, plastic deformation of nano-scale objects under stress. In this contribution, we
propose a method for alleviating problems with unknown factors affecting mesh for damage formulations. It makes
it possible to construct predictable models employing CAD software for structural investigations and optimizations
of the processes of plastic deformation. First, we review developed fracture model and developed model for
isotropic damage formulation applied to the nano-scale domain space. Second, we study boundary value problem for
particle interaction among part specimen using the implicit gradient model. Finally, we conduct test benchmarks to
validate propositions and to show correctness of the proposed models.

1.1. Advantages of nanoscale analysis
There is a promise of computational science to decompose macroscopic complexity into microscopic simplicity
for the domain specific problem resolution. The payoff is the increase for the high spatial an time resolution of the
computational efforts. This is achieved via simplified problem formulation and removal of the empirical correcting
coefficients, which leads to a clear understanding of the dependencies, and enhances understanding of the evolution
at a much higher fidelity level.
1.2. Methodology
Let us consider a bulk material undergoing a plastic deformation, in which case various processes take place,
including but not limited to dislocation and deformation of material particles, size and form changes, and emergence
of defects. We study material processes at small specimen scale. Moreover, to study the behavior of the material we
employed simulation using nano-scale equipment.
Because dislocations in the material are not uniform by definition, simulation should be performed for each block
of material, but it’s computationally extensive due to high interconnection factor between edges in network, which
can be built to represent the material. Yield stress at small specimen size is not well-defined. Phenomenology of
plastic deformation based on the statistical properties is not well-studied. It is observed that fluctuation of stressstrain is in response to damage of individual specimen. Irregular plastic response of submicron crystalline materials
is conceived as a self-organizing phenomenon of strain avalanches. We present a statistical analysis of the
fluctuating stress-strain response of individual chunks of metal. Main proposition is that fundamentally the stressstrain dependency holds the key to other empirical aspects of the flow [13]. We wanted to perform analysis of
plastic deformation and emerging damage effects to further expand possible applications of such technique, which
allows diminishing needs for corrective modifications of the details and accounting for potential defects in the metal.
2.

Damage modeling

Furthermore, in this contribution we use isogeometric finite elements to model damage formulations. The
analysis based on the isogeometric models was introduced by Hughes [14] and has been applied to a variety of
problems. Their advantage includes relationship between geometry and solution space. To avoid mesh
dependencies of the process we propose to relate the material properties to the element size. The proposed method is
contained by mapping where an internal length scale can be introduced by a spatial smoothing function in the
continuum formulation. Gradient approximations of this smoothing function have led to the development of damage
models where an internal length scale is introduced through gradients of an equivalent strain field.
In this work, we study mechanisms of formation of dislocations and their parameters. To accomplish this, we’re
mapping macro model of plastic deformation to nano-scale particle. For the modeling, natural units should be
introduced, such as velocity ɓ, strain ɀ, stress ɒ and dislocation density ɏ to represent particle movements at
specified scale. Let us consider potential modeling of fractures which can occur in the model based on the state of
the part and each corresponding particle.
2.1. Fracture modeling
The damage models are used for continuum models to simulate physical defects arising in plastic deformation
processes. The meshing of the model is proposed in an alternative way to adhere to the particle sizes. To avoid mesh
dependencies we propose, based on the thoughts from [15], to relate material properties to the size of particle
[16,17]. The model of gradient damage formulation, based on Taylor expansion is used to approximate to an
integral, which derives from the two second-order PDEs and can be easily discretized because it is based on the  ଴ continuous finite function.
2.2. Isotropic damage formulation

This model is known as nonlocal damage formulation where the local equivalent strain maps to strain tensor via a
scalar. While having major advantages, the disadvantage of this formulation from computational aspect is that it
requires the computation of an integral for the evaluation of the constitutive behavior at every particle.
The nonlocal equivalent strain can be approximated via Taylor expansion as follows:

where corresponding fourth and six-order results can be extracted by ignoring the third and second-order spatial
derivatives in the (14) above. To validate the developed method, the nano-deformation experiments have been
conducted on an indenter. We applied developed method to the benchmark problems and evaluated principal
metrics. Tests modes also included measurement of the flange buckling and grain measurement. To conduct
multistep optimization process, principles outlined in [7] were applied.

Benchmarks

3.1. Numerical verifications
The typical problem with parts formed using drawing is the buckling of the flange, which usually means the
specimen is defective and micro-level voids are emerging near the deformation into buckling. Modeling of this
phenomenon is done using steel sheet designed to undergone the stress test where stress is exceeding plasticity.
The simulations to verify the described propositions were performed for the testing problems. We consider a
model loaded in extraction as shown in Fig. 1. The 40 mm deep drawing was conducted on the model using tool
with profile decreased. For each step, the characteristic values were calculated [13].

Fig. 2. Oscillation of elements and number of discontinuities

The finite element solution tends to oscillate with some frequency when pressure is applied and discontinuities to
appear, unless the solution is stabilized, see Fig. 2. Disadvantage of the stabilized solution is causing numerical
dissipation, which decreases the accuracy [19]. To overcome this, we use spacetime-discontinuous Galerkin method,
proposed in [20]. This method has lower probability for oscillation so that direct patch-by-patch advancing front is
generated with linear computational complexity (cf. sec. 3.1, [19]).
The results obtained during simulation suggest that only long-range interactions between dislocations are
captured for the submicron level of plastic flow.
3.2. Test 2: Numerical verifications of avalanches
Stress-strain dependency can be derived for this model. It can also be observed that the avalanches are present in
the model during the plastic flow simulation. Avalanche state can be derived as a norm of stress, i.e.

We’ve built the graph of the dependencies between the modeling step and norm of the stress for the model in
avalanche state, see Fig. 3. Measurements were obtained for stress vs. plastic strain dependency and indicate strain
avalanches stochastic propagation for different samples, which converges into dominating front.
Furthermore, tail of avalanche velocity distribution comes from the system in avalanche state. The goal here is to
minimize the effect of avalanches into form of the part, which improves quality of the product.
In conclusion the correlation produces finite amplitude [17]. Then stress and velocity distribution must have
reciprocal dependency.

The force-displacement curves were obtained using the meshes. It is observed that with increased order of
magnitude, the approximation of the result improved, Fig. 4.
We can conclude that for submicron sizes the dependency between stress and strain holds and it is represented as
smooth function with the representative points specific to a particular material. The theoretical similarity between
strain response curves suggests that general behavior is captured for the nano-scale particle flow.

Discussion

4.1. Dynamics of dislocations
It is rather difficult to measure deformations and hence dislocations directly in the modeled problem. The
availability of the results is scarce and we performed modeled dislocation measurement from the experiment
simulation. The strains were measured during the individual stress-controlled simulations. The results indicate
presence of strain avalanches, which result in different deformation patterns for difference sample experiments. In
the observation it was determined that there are many definitions for deformation and for strain. It is hard to
introduce infinitely many versions and it’s difficult to determine one which constitutes an elastic relation. Natural
assumptions can be made regarding correlation of dislocations. Previously [21] it was shown that stresses in the
internal locations are distributed stochastically.
4.2. Correlation between nanostructures and mechanical behavior
It was observed that mechanical behavior observed through cold drawing confirms hypothesis when larger scale
deformation can be projected to the nano-level deformation. Quasi-static stress-strain curves are retained for the
strain of the grains, which conforms to our model and results for plastic deformations.
4.3. Nanostructures and their evolution
Traditional discreet approximations cannot capture localized deformation areas on the order of nanoscale
characteristic lengths. Constitutive behavior at these significantly smaller scales is usually cannot be projected into
macroscale average behavior. The important material behavior is difficult to explain including fracture and strength
using conventional methods, but can be elaborated more clearly using proposed method.
Presence of strain hardening can be explained through anisotropic properties of the modeled material. Dislocation
pileup at grain boundaries is present near the areas affected by buckling.
Non-uniform dislocation distribution between regions near grain boundary and the grain interior is emerging due
to the non-uniform deformation between regions. We’ve employed the continuum theory which fully describes
material using matrix representation and process parameters. The (࣢ ஑ , Ʉതሺሻǡ ୧ǡ୨ ) describes inhomogeneity in the
matrix. The damage models are used for continuum models to simulate the physical defects arising in plastic
drawing processes were found applicable to the problem domain.
Conclusion
The nano-deformation has been examined in the context of plastic deformations. Assumed stress-strain
formulation was extended to nano-scale and tested in large deformation and problems typically solved by finite
elements. We adopted isogeometric projective formulation is response for the volumetric damage, without resort to
other techniques. The presented simulations show high predictability for characteristics formulated in other wellknown methods.
