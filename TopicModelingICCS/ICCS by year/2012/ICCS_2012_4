Abstract
Round-oﬀ error analysis has been historically studied by analyzing the condition number of the associated matrix.
By controlling the size of the condition number, it is possible to guarantee a prescribed round-oﬀ error tolerance.
However, the opposite is not true, since it is possible to have a system of linear equations with an arbitrarily large
condition number that still delivers a small round-oﬀ error. In this paper, we perform a round-oﬀ error analysis
in context of 1D and 2D hp-adaptive Finite Element simulations for the case of Poisson equation. We conclude
that boundary conditions play a fundamental role on the round-oﬀ error analysis, specially for the so-called ‘radical
meshes’. Moreover, we illustrate the importance of the right-hand side when analyzing the round-oﬀ error, which is
independent of the condition number of the matrix.
Keywords: Finite Element Methods (FEM), hp-adaptivity, round-oﬀ error, condition number.

1. Introduction
The study of round-oﬀ error is crucial when solving a linear system of equations, since it may pollute and even
destroy the solution of the problem. Round-oﬀ error is of particular concern in adaptive hp-ﬁnite element (FE)
computations, where h denotes the element size and p the polynomial order of approximation, both varying locally
throughout the computational grid. There is a potential for large round-oﬀ errors when using heavy mesh-reﬁnements
in a hp-adaptive FE discretization to approximate a particular feature of the solution.
During the last decades, several studies have been devoted to analyze round-oﬀ error in the context of FE computations. Historically, most researchers have analyzed the round-oﬀ error appearing in the solution of a general
linear system of equations by studying the condition number of the associated matrix. Thus, the pioneering works of
Neumann and Goldstine [1] in 1947; [2] in 1951, and Turing [3] in 1948, analyzed the problem of round-oﬀ error
and introduced its relationship to the conditioning of the problem. A further important development in the study of

condition number was performed by Wilkinson [4] and Isaacson [5]. In this work, Isaacson bounds the sensitivity of
the solution with respect to perturbations in the right-hand side by using the condition number of the matrix.
For the case of linear systems of equations arising from uniform h-reﬁned meshes in FE computations of second
order diﬀerential operators, the condition number κ is known to be of the form O(h−2 ), where h is the size of smallest
element in the mesh with respect to the domain size. For non-uniform meshes, the above result constitutes an upper
bound of the condition number of the matrix, although in some cases, it can be improved.
Since the condition number controls the round-oﬀ error, a natural approach to minimize error is by decreasing
the condition number. One way to achieve this is by performing an optimal scaling of basis functions, addressed in
the past by [6]. A particularly important case of non-uniform meshes is the so-called ‘radical mesh’ [7, 8], where
heavy reﬁnements are performed towards some ﬁxed point. This situation often occurs in practical applications when
the problem exhibits a singularity, and adaptive grids are employed to properly approximate the solution around the
singularity. In Figure 1 we show 1D and 2D radical meshes after some ’radical’ reﬁnements.

Figure 1: Left: Radical Mesh in 1D. Right: Radical Mesh in 2D.

In context of FE methods, it is possible to re-scale the basis functions as described in [9] to minimize the condition
number. While this is an eﬀective idea, the re-scaling of basis functions is not implemented in most FEM codes,
perhaps because such implementation is not in general a trivial task. Furthermore, we observed that round-oﬀ error in
our adaptive hp-FE computations is in fact not signiﬁcant, even when we omitted the use of re-scaled basis functions.
The main objective of this work is to analyze round-oﬀ error when diﬀerent boundary conditions (and hence,
diﬀerent right-hand sides) are considered, and speciﬁcally, to explain why we do not observe a degradation in the
solution when we employ conventional (not re-scaled) basis functions with radical meshes. In this context, the main
contribution of this paper is to observe that the round-oﬀ error is not always related to the condition number. Rather, a
new ingredient needs to be introduced to fully understand round-oﬀ error, namely, the right-hand side. This was also
observed by Rice [10], who concluded that the condition number does not always provide a reliable guide to study the
eﬀects of round-oﬀ error. In this paper, we perform a more detailed analysis in context of hp-FE computations. Via
an eigenvalue analysis, we observe that the right-hand side may excite only a few of the eigenvalues of the associated
matrix. This results in smaller round-oﬀ error than that predicted by the condition number.
Another contribution of the paper is to exhibit that round-oﬀ error is aﬀected by a particular choice of the righthand side. Finally, we also consider the case of p reﬁnements. Taking into account that the choice of basis functions
can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the condition number [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and round oﬀ-error, we brieﬂy analyze the impact of
this choice using hierarchical Peano [16, 17, 18] and Integrated Legendre Polynomials (ILP) [19] basis functions.
Due to the intrinsic complexity associated with the theoretical and implementation analysis within the hp-adaptive
FEM, we restrict our analysis to the Poisson equation. This work is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the
model problem and solution methodology. Section 3 explains how it is possible to obtain small round-oﬀ errors even
in the presence of large condition numbers. In Section 4 the numerical results are shown, and ﬁnally the conclusions
are outlined in Section 5.

2. Model Problem and Solution Method
In this section we introduce the mathematical problem to be solved. We also discuss the variational formulation
and the method we shall use to solve it: hp-adaptive Finite Element Method (FEM). The main advantage of this
method is that with an optimal sequence of hp reﬁnements, exponential convergence is achieved. In 1D this was
proved by Gui and Babuska [20] and in 2D by Babuska and Guo [21], and Schwab [22].
2.1. Model Problem: Poisson Equation
Our model problem is given by the Poisson equation:
−Δ u(x) = f

(1)

where f is the right-hand side, u is the solution and Δ is the Laplace operator in 1D or 2D.
We will analyze both, 1D and 2D problems, Ω being the computational domain, corresponding to [0, 1] in 1D and
to [0, 1]2 in 2D. We introduce essential (Dirichlet) boundary conditions in some region ΓD of the boundary Γ, and
natural (Neumann) boundary conditions in some region ΓN . To facilitate the round-oﬀ error analysis, we will select
two a priori solutions.

2.2. The hp-adaptive Finite Element Method
The hp-adaptive ﬁnite element method (hp-FEM) is a general version of the ﬁnite element method (FEM) with
a special choice of basis functions. Here, a piecewise-polynomial approximation is employed, as before, h is the
element size and p the polynomial degree of approximation.
Taking a ﬁnite dimensional space Vhp ∈ V, where V is the Sovolev space of order one, H 1 , (3) can be discretized
as:
⎧
D
⎪
⎪
⎨ Find uhp ∈ uhp + Vhp such that:
(4)
⎪
⎪
⎩ b(uhp , vhp ) = l(vhp ) ∀vhp ∈ Vhp ,
where subscript ‘hp’ denotes an hp discretization. The mesh consists of a collection of K elements, where the bilinear
form is expressed as:
b(uhp , vhp ) =

bK (uhp , vhp ) =
K

and the linear form

(6)

This leads to a linear system of N equations (being N = dim(Vhp )):
Bd = l.

(7)

Here, B is a sparse, symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrix, d is the vector of unknown coeﬃcients that deﬁne the
disctrete solution of our problem, and l is the load vector the right-hand side. To solve the linear system arising from
the Galerkin discretization, one of the most populars direct solvers is used: MUMPS [23].
Note that in this work the following deﬁnition of the condition number is used:
κ(B) = λmax /λmin ,

(8)

where λmax and λmin are the biggest and smallest eigenvalues of matrix B, respectively.
3. Round-oﬀ Error and Conditioning
It is commonly believed that the condition number determines the behavior of the round-oﬀ error. It is true that,
up to a constant, the condition number is an upper bound of the round-oﬀ error, but these numbers are not equivalent.
For instance, despite its huge condition number, solving the following linear system of equations with a direct method
returns an exact solution.

This simple example illustrates why it is interesting to study the relation between conditioning and round-oﬀ error.
To do this, we now give some intuition about how a particular right-hand side can minimize the round-oﬀ error without
improving the condition number. Following the argument of [24], let δd be the error produced in the solution when
the right-hand side of (7) is perturbed by + δ . Then,
δd = B−1 δ .

(10)

Expanding δ in terms of the eigenvectors v1 , ..., vN of B, as
N

δ =

ci vi ,
i=1

(11)

1478

J. Alvarez-Aramberri et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1474 – 1483

and inserting this expression into (10), one obtains that
N

δd =

ci vi /λi ,

(12)

i=1

where λi are the eigenvalues (strictly positive) of B. From (12), if the right-hand side of the problem is a collection of
few eigenvectors (ci = 0 for several i), then the expected error seems to be smaller.
We can intuitively illustrate this idea in the following way. Let us eigendecompose matrix B. Then,
V DV −1 d = l,

(13)

where V is the matrix containing the eigenvectors of B and D is the diagonal matrix containing its eigenvalues. Being
B symmetric positive deﬁnite, V contains the orthonormalized eigenvectors, and multiplying on the left by V −1 , as
V −1 = V T (orthogonal eigenvectors), we have
DV T l = V T l,

(14)

Dy = z,

(15)

which can be rewritten as
if y = DV and z = V l.
The idea of having a small error when the right-hand side is a combination of few eigenvectors returns. In
particular, if we consider a unique eigenvector in (12), it means having z = (0 · · · 0 · · · c · · · 0 · · · 0), being c ∈ R. With
this choice of z and since D is a diagonal matrix, then only one contribution of y (the corresponding to the nonzero
entry of z) needs to be computed.
(16)
yi = zi /λi , or yi = c/λi .

The remaining eigenvalues of the matrix do not contribute to the round-oﬀ errror.

We consider two sets of boundary conditions to analyze their impact in the round-oﬀ error and in the condition number
of the stiﬀness matrix:
⎧
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎨ Γ1 : ΓD = {x ∈ Ω : x = 0 or x = 1}
(18)
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩ Γ2 : ΓD = {x ∈ Ω : x = 1}
being ΓN = ∂Ω \ ΓD . In Figure 3 we compare the condition numbers and round-oﬀ errors for both types of boundary
conditions and two diﬀerent meshes, namely: a uniformly reﬁned grid, and a ‘radical’ mesh.
In the left panels of Figure 3, which correspond to uniform grid reﬁnements, we observe a strong correlation
between round-oﬀ error and conditioning of the matrix, independently of the selected boundary conditions. However,
the results from the radical meshes (Figure 3 (right)) are dramatically diﬀerent. The condition number and the roundoﬀ error do not behave equally. In particular, we see that for the ﬁrst set of boundary conditions, where the condition
number is extremely large, the round-oﬀ error remains small.
It is commonly thought that an enormous condition number always implies a large round-oﬀ error and therefore,
an inaccurate solution. However, in some cases, we are able to properly solve systems of linear equations (and obtain
small round-oﬀ errors) despite having very large condition numbers. This is due to the eﬀect of the right-hand side,
which has been explained in the previous section. Namely, the right-hand side does not excite all eigenvalues of the
problem and because of this, the performance may be better what the worst case scenario predicted by the condition
number.

Of particular interest is our test problem with a radical mesh, which often appears in practical engineering applications where a singularity arises at the boundary. That singularity is mathematically expressed as an inﬁnite value
of the derivative, which is necessarily prescribed by a Dirichlet BC (since a Neumann BC cannot be set to inﬁnity).
For this case, we observe that the round-oﬀ error remains small despite the huge condition number. Moreover, the
case of a Neumann BC implies that the value of the derivative at that point is ﬁnite, which means that no singularity
is present, making the use of a radical mesh unnecessary in any practical application. Thus, it is not a coincidence
that adaptive methods for Laplace equation typically exhibit a small round-oﬀ error in most engineering applications,
despite the appearance of heavy reﬁnements, which indicate a large condition number.

grid (left) and a radical mesh (right). ILP shape functions of order p = 2 are used.

For both kind of meshes, a peculiar, but diﬀerent, behavior of the eigenvalues is also observed. There exists
some grouping between them. This grouping depends on the number of elements and on the polynomial order of
approximation.

Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered in both edges (according with the deﬁnition of (2), one on the left and
zero on the right). f (x) = −2x0−2 , for x < x0 (otherwise 0). Selecting diﬀerent values of x0 corresponds to diﬀerent

right-hand sides of the problem. The stiﬀness matrix, and hence the condition number, remains invariant. Therefore,
if diﬀerent round-oﬀ errors are obtained is because the right-hand side f (x) has been modiﬁed.
In Figure 4 we display the round-oﬀ error corresponding to diﬀerent values of x0 . We observe that round-oﬀ
error depends directly on the constant we select, namely, on the right-hand side. This occurs because each f (x)
excites diﬀerent eigenvalues of the problem. Therefore, one can conclude that round-oﬀ error depends not only on the
associated stiﬀness matrix, but also upon the right-hand side.

number of the stiﬀness matrix.

⎩ Γ2 : ΓD = {(x, y) ∈ Ω : x = 0 or x = 1 or y = 1}
being ΓN = ∂Ω \ ΓD . Notice that for Γ1 we only consider Dirichlet boundary conditions while for Γ2 a Neumann
boundary condition is established in the reﬁned side of the radical mesh.
Figure 5 shows a comparison between the condition number and round-oﬀ error for radical and uniform meshes
for the diﬀerent boundary conditions discussed above. In the case of uniform meshes, the two sets of boundary
conditions deliver similar results. The round-oﬀ error grows proportionally to the matrix condition number (which
for these types of grids is known to be proportional to the inverse of the mesh size squared). For radical meshes, the
Neumann boundary condition produces a dramatic increase in the condition number and round-oﬀ error. However, in
the 2D case, the problem is still solvable for both sets of boundary conditions, despite the large condition numbers.

This result agrees with [9], since 2D is a special case where the re-scaling of basis functions is not necessary.
However, as we showed in the 1D case and according with the theory, in 3D a disagreement between the round-oﬀ
error and condition number is also expected.
In the 2D problem, a peculiar behavior in the eigenvalues is also empirically observed. There exists two clusters
of eigenvalues. This clustering depends on the number of elements of the mesh and the polynomial order p.

basis functions are considered.
We observe an initial pre-asymptotic behavior (a plateau) where p method dominates, followed by an asymptotic
one, where h dominates. Thus, when the number of elements grows suﬃciently, the choice of basis functions is not
important, since both give a similar performance in terms of round-oﬀ error. However, if we do not have enough

a more detailed study of conditioning due to the use of diﬀerent boundary conditions, we refer to [11]
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we analyze the relation between condition number and round-oﬀ error. We point out that in the
context of hp-adaptive FE, it is possible to have a system of linear equations with an arbitrarily large condition
number that still brings small round-oﬀ errors. Therefore, the round-oﬀ error is not always related to the condition
number and something else has to be introduced to completely understand its behavior, namely, the right-hand side of
the system.
We intentionally select a particular a priori solution which allows us to deﬁne diﬀerent right-hand sides. The
associated stiﬀness matrix remains invariant, and therefore with the same condition number. We obtain diﬀerent
round oﬀ-errors, because each of the right-hand sides excites diﬀerent eigenvalues of the problem. In this way the
right-hand side plays a key role in round-oﬀ error.
For the case of adaptive methods, a Neumann boundary condition implies a ﬁnite value of the derivative at that
point, and hence, no singularity appears at that boundary. Therefore, radical meshes are unnecessary. On the other
hand, if a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed, this may lead to a singular behavior of the solution at that boundary
making convenient the use of a radical mesh, but in that case, we show numerically that the round-oﬀ error will still
remain small.
Finally, we also show that for high polynomial orders, ILP provides better results than Peano hierarchical shape
functions when a small number of elements is considered. However, if a suﬃcient number of reﬁnements are carried
out, the choice of basis functions is not important.
