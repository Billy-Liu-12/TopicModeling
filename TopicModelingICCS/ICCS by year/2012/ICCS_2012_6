Abstract
This paper employs a 3D hp self-adaptive grid-reﬁnement ﬁnite element strategy for the solution of a particular
electromagnetic waveguide structure known as Magic-T. This structure is utilized as a power divider/combiner in
communication systems as well as in other applications. It often incorporates dielectrics, metallic screws, round
corners, and so on, which may facilitate its construction or improve its design, but signiﬁcantly diﬃcult its modeling
when employing semi-analytical techniques. The hp-adaptive ﬁnite element method enables accurate modeling of
a Magic-T structure even in the presence of these undesired materials/geometries. Numerical results demonstrate
the suitability of the hp-adaptive method for modeling a Magic-T rectangular waveguide structure, delivering errors
below 0.5% with a limited number of unknowns. Solutions of waveguide problems delivered by the self-adaptive
hp-FEM are comparable to those obtained with semi-analytical techniques such as the Mode Matching method, for
problems where the latest methods can be applied. At the same time, the hp-adaptive FEM enables accurate modeling
of more complex waveguide structures.
Keywords: Finite Element Method (FEM), hp-adaptivity, electromagnetic waveguides.

1. Introduction
Electromagnetic (EM) waveguides are of great importance for our daily lifes, since they can be found in a variety
of devices, including communication systems, radars, satellites, and medical equipment. In this paper, we focus on a
speciﬁc type of passive rectangular waveguides known as power dividers and power combiners. As suggested by its
name, power dividers/combiners are used to either divide or combine the power of a given EM signal and they are
employed, among other applications, in RF & Microwave front-ends, and various types of antennas.
One of such power dividers is the so-called Magic-T (also known as magic tee), ﬁrst described in [1]. Its geometry
is depicted in Fig.1. It consists of a “combination” of two orthogonal T-shaped junctions, one in the magnetic H-plane

and one in the electric E-plane. Therefore, when an input signal is injected into the H-port (port 3), the output signal
becomes equally distributed between ports 1 and 2 and will be in phase. When an input signal is injected into the
E-port (port 4), the output signal also becomes equally distributed between ports 3 and 4, but this time the output
signals will have opposite phase (180 degrees out of phase). Its name comes from its magical electrical properties.
Namely, when ports1 3 and 4 are simultaneously matched, that is, when the structure is designed in such a way that
the energy reﬂected at these ports is null, then one can show that ports 1 and 2 become “magically” matched and
decoupled.
A Magic-T waveguide, as well as many other waveguides, operates in the monomode region, that is, the excitation
frequency is such that when the ports are placed at a certain distance from its center, then only one propagating mode
(the so-called TE10 mode) is present with a non-negligible amplitude at the ports. All other modes are evanescent,
and their amplitude quickly diminishes as the distance from the waveguide discontinuity increases. This implies that
the EM ﬁeld at the ports can be characterized by simply measuring the amount of energy of the propagating mode
that is reﬂected at the excited port and the energy at the other ports. This quantities normalized by the incident energy
(“incident power wave”) are related the so-called scattering parameter, also known as S-parameter. More generally,
we denote by S i j to the S-parameter measured at port j when the i-th port is excited. Speciﬁcally, |S ii |2 represents
1 The

ports are the apertures at the end of the waveguides.

1446

the ratio between the mean powers of the reﬂected and incident waves. The argument of S ii represents the phase shift
between the reﬂected and incident waves. Analogously, |S ji |2 , j i relates the power relation between the transmitted
wave at port- j and the incident wave at port-i; the argument of S ji gives the phase shift between transmitted and
incident waves The corresponding [S ] matrix with entries S i j is the so-called scattering matrix.
From the engineering point of view, it is essential to design waveguides with a particular [S ] matrix. In the case
of a perfect Magic-T, the desired [S ] matrix is:

The isolation between ports 3 and 4 comes simply by the properties of the E-plane and H-plane T-junctions. However,
as it was mentioned previously, the isolation between ports 1 and 2, requires the compensation of the magic-T so
ports 3 and 4 are simultaneously matched. This can be accomplished, by the use of internal posts or other techniques
without disturbing the symmetry of the structure (c.f., [2]). In any case, due to design limitations (e.g., geometry, size,
construction materials and imperfections), it is impossible to achieve the above scattering pattern, and suboptimal
designs need to be developed. In this context, the use of numerical simulations is essential both to design improved
waveguides under certain restrictions as well as to evaluate the performance of a given waveguide conﬁguration.
Several computational techniques can be used for the analysis of a Magic-T waveguide structure. First, we have
analytic (or semi-analytic) techniques such as the Mode Matching (MM) method (c.f., [3, 4]), which are computationally very eﬃcient, and they can be employed to design several devices with given speciﬁcations using optimization
procedures [5, 6]. These methods have severe limitations in terms of the geometries they can handle. Thus, hybrid
extensions as those of [7–10]) have been developed in the last years. They overcome many of the limitations of pure
analytic (or semi-analytic) techniques but still need “separable” geometries, which limits the type of geometries they
can handle. Speciﬁcally, they cannot support the presence of arbitrary objects such as screws or curved geometries
that can appear as a result of the waveguide construction and manufacturing. Thus, the use of pure numerical methods
that can analyze the structure as a whole, taking into account the eﬀect of round corners due to ﬁnite radii of milling
tools, the inﬂuence/sensibility to position of tuning elements (posts, screws, etc) not oriented in the coordinate axis,
losses, and so on, is preferred.
The main advantage of pure discretization methods such as ﬁnite element methods (FEM) and Integral Equation
(IE) approaches is their ﬂexibility to model arbitrary materials and geometries. Moreover, even for devices designed
with semi-analytic methods, they need to be ﬁnally validated with a pure numerical technique that can analyze the
structure as a whole, taking into account the eﬀect of round corners due to ﬁnite radii of milling tools, the inﬂuence/sensibility to position of tuning elements (posts, screws, etc), losses, and so on. In this context, FEM has
demonstrated to be a powerful and versatile tool. However, high accuracy is not always easy to achieve for conventional FEM when dealing with ﬁeld singularities, high-contrast material data, etc. Thus, semi-analytic results (when
available) are typically considered as a reference for engineering analysis.
In this work, the use of a highly-accurate three-dimensional (3D) fully automatic hp-adaptive FEM for the characterization of a Magic-T waveguide is proposed. This method combines the geometrical ﬂexibility of a FEM with
an accuracy that is often superior to that provided by semi-analytical methods, as it will be shown in Section 4.
Such a high-accuracy delivered by the hp-FEM is due to the exponential convergence of the error on optimally designed hp-meshes. These meshes adapt to the problem of interest, and are delivered automatically (without any
user-interaction) by the hp-adaptive strategy. This grid-reﬁnement strategy eﬃciently deals with diﬀerent types of
singularities. Moreover, the dispersion (pollution) error is also automatically minimized by increasing the polynomial
order of approximation (see [11, 12]), and therefore, the method is also capable of solving eﬃciently high-frequency
waveguide problems.
This paper constitutes an extension of our previous 2D paper [13] to the case of 3D waveguides. The level of
complexity in 3D (in both, mathematical and computational senses) of the hp FE method, and speciﬁcally of the
hp-adaptivity, is several orders of magnitude higher than in 2D. This is due, among other reasons, to the higher
number of “choices” available to decide the next hp-mesh at each step of the adaptivity. Also, it is due to the (higher)

1447

computational order of complexity with polynomial order p involved in the computations. In addition, a much larger
number of unknowns are usually involved in 3D problems when compared with 2D problems.
The particular hp-adaptive algorithm used in this paper builds upon previous versions developed by L. Demkowicz
and his collaborators [14–18]. In the version used in this work, we ﬁxed a number of errors and implementation
problems, we increased its performance for realistic 3D computations, and we implemented proper post-processing
schemes to compute the S-matrix.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the mathematical formulation of the problem. Then, the
hp-method including the self-adaptive reﬁnement strategy is detailed in Section 3. Section 4 outlines the main results
for a Magic-T waveguide structure obtained with the hp-adaptive method. Finally, some conclusions are depicted in
Section 5.
2. Mathematical Formulation
The EM phenomena are governed by a set of four ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) known as
Maxwell’s equations. For a time-harmonic nonzero frequency excitation (ω
0), two of those equations (the socalled Gauss’s laws) become redundant, and the remaining two equations (Ampere’s and Faraday’s laws) along with
the corresponding boundary conditions provide a unique solution for the EM ﬁeld:
∇ × E = − jωμH + Jimp
∇×H=
jωεE

(Faraday’s law)
(Ampere’s law)

√
In the above equations, E and H stand for the electric and magnetic ﬁeld, respectively, j = −1 is the imaginary unit,
and μ are the electric permittivity and permeability of the medium, respectively, and Jimp is the impressed volumetric
electric current, which is zero in our case.
The above system of two ﬁrst order PDE’s can be further simpliﬁed to a single second order PDE in terms of
magnetic ﬁeld H by taking the curl of Ampere’s law pre-multiplied by 1/ and using Faraday’s law to obtain the so
called reduced wave equation:
1
∇ × ∇ × H − ω2 μH = 0
(2)
ε
Assuming TE10 mode excitation and excitation frequency in the monomode region, the following boundary condition can be used at the ports, namely:
1
ω2 μ
nˆ × ∇ × H + j
nˆ × nˆ × H = Uin , at the port boundaries (Γ p )
ε
β10

(3)

where nˆ is the unit outward vector normal to Γ, β10 is the phase constant of the TE10 , and Uin is deﬁned as
Uin = 2 j

ω2 μ
nˆ × nˆ × Hin
β10

(4)

with Hin being the incident magnetic ﬁeld at the port. When Hin = 0, the above boundary conditions at the ports (3)
become absorbing boundary conditions for the monomode propagation case. The remaining modes are evanescent
when in the monomode region, and they quickly diminish in amplitude as they travel towards the ports. Thus, it is
necessary to truncate the FEM domain at a certain distance from the waveguide discontinuity so the amplitude of the
evanescent modes becomes negligible. The waveguide walls are modelled with perfect electric boundary conditions:
1
nˆ × ∇ × H = 0,
ε

at perfect electric conductors (ΓN )

(5)

The FEM variational formulation is obtained by multiplying (2) by a test function F ∈ H(curl, Ω), integrating by
parts, and incorporating the boundary conditions to obtain:
1
(∇ × F) · ( ∇ × H) dΩ − ω2
ε

We note that the above formulation is given in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld, although a dual formulation in terms
of the electric ﬁeld can also be derived in a similar way.
3. hp Finite Elements and Automatic Adaptivity
With each ﬁnite element, we associate element size h and order of approximation p. In the h-adaptive version of
FEM, element size h may vary from element to element, while order of approximation p is ﬁxed (usually p=1,2). In
the p-adaptive version of the FEM, p may vary locally, while h remains constant throughout the adaptive procedure.
Finally, a true hp-adaptive version of the FEM allows for local variations of both h and p.
The hp-FEM constitutes a ﬂexible method suitable for solutions containing both smooth and non-smooth components in diﬀerent areas of the computational domain [18, 19]. Solutions incorporating smooth components and a
variety of singularities are typical in waveguide applications, and thus, the hp-FEM is especially well-suited for these
applications. While the spectral p-FEM provides accurate approximations of the smooth components of the solution
and minimizes the dispersion error in the case of wave propagation problems (see [11, 12, 20]), the h-FEM is intended
to accurately approximate singular solutions, as it occurs in the case of re-entrant corners in EM or in areas of the
computational domain where three or more materials meet at a point.
To determine an optimal distribution of element size h and polynomial order of approximation p, we shall employ
a self-adaptive reﬁnement strategy based on the iterative scheme described in [16, 18]. At each step, given an arbitrary
hp-grid, we ﬁrst perform a global and uniform hp-reﬁnement to obtain the h/2, p+1-grid. Second, we approximate the
error function in the hp-grid by evaluating the diﬀerence between the solutions associated to the hp-and h/2, p + 1grids. If the error exceeds a user-prescribed tolerance error, then we project the error function to guide optimal
reﬁnements over the hp-grid, and we iterate the process. Once the prescribed tolerance error has been met, we deliver
the h/2, p+1-grid as the ultimate solution of the problem. This three-dimensional reﬁnement strategy has been proved
to be eﬃcient, robust, and highly accurate [18] in many applications.
For optimal selection between h and p reﬁnements, we utilize the projection-based interpolation (see [21, 22])
operators to project the solution associated to the h/2, p + 1-grid into a sequence of coarser grids containing more
unknowns than those of the hp-grid, and we compare results of those projections to determine the one providing the
largest error decrease rate per added unknown. To evaluate the error of each projected solution, we employ the energy
norm. To make this optimization problem tractable from the computational point of view, we ﬁrst determine optimal
reﬁnements for edges, then for faces, and ﬁnally for element interiors. Critical to the success of this projection based
approach is the commutativity of the so-called de Rham diagram, which is used to ensure stability and convergence
of the ﬁnal formulation, avoiding the appearance of spurious (unphysical) modes. The simulator utilizes hexahedral
edge (Nedelec) elements of variable order of approximation to discretize H(curl).
Our hp-adaptive FEM supports local anisotropic reﬁnements in both h and p. Support of anisotropic reﬁnements
dramatically increases the implementation complexity, but it is essential to achieve optimal convergence rates in the
case of edge singularities or in the presence of boundary layers. Both situations occur in our Magic-T problem of
interest. To ensure continuity, we enforce the 1-irregularity rule and use the constrained approximation [23].
As mentioned above, the main advantage of the hp-FEM resides on the proof (see [24–30]) showing that it can
achieve exponential convergence for elliptic problems with a piecewise analytic solution, whereas h- or p-FEM converge at best algebraically. To attain that goal, we have further extended the existing hp-adaptive strategy for the case
of waveguide problems.
For the analysis of the Magic-T, we have implemented impedance boundary conditions as well as several postprocessing routines for computing the S-parameters, graphics, and so on. We have also ﬁxed a few problems and
accelerated a number of key features within the software such as the computation of the projections during the hpadaptivity.
4. Numerical Results
To illustrate the results delivered by the fully automatic hp-adaptivity, we display in Fig. 2 two meshes corresponding to the 3rd and 13th iteration of the adaptive procedure for the Magic-T structure excited by port 1. As expected,
we observe heavy p-reﬁnements in those areas of the domain where solution is smooth (away from the junctions)

and additional h-reﬁnements where a singular behavior of some components of the solution is expected (close to the
junctions).
This adaptive strategy results in exponential convergence rates, as illustrated in Fig. 3, where we display the
convergence history (up to an error around 0.3%) for the Magic-T structure excited by ports 3 and 4.
The tenth mesh delivered by the hp-adaptivity when exciting port 3 is shown in Fig. 4 (left panel). The ninth
mesh delivered when exciting port 4 is displayed in Fig. 4 (right panel). Both meshes correspond to an energy error
around 1%. The initial mesh was selected to be as coarse as possible in terms of h and with uniform p = 2. The large
diﬀerence of the meshes at this error level is due to the following. When exciting port 3, the T-junction of the H-plane
is excited (ports 1,2,3). And when port 4 is excited, the T-junction of the E-plane is excited (ports 1,2,4). The ﬁeld of
the H-plane T-junction is quite diﬀerent to the one of the E-plane T-junction and so are the meshes delivered by the
adaptivity.
The isolation between ports 3 and 4 is illustrated in Fig. 5 in which the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
structure when exciting port 3 is displayed. Speciﬁcally, the component of the displayed magnetic ﬁeld corresponds
to the longitudinal component of port 3 and the transverse component of ports 1 and 2. No ﬁeld is observed in port 4.
Note the stationary wave pattern in waveguide of port 3 due to existence of a non-negligible reﬂected wave in addition
to the incident wave. No stationary wave is observed in the output waveguides of ports 1 and 2 as there is only one
wave propagating outward on each of the transmitted ports.
As the structure has four ports, there is a maximum of sixteen S -parameters to be computed. However, by reciprocity S ji = S i j . In addition, the symmetry of the Magic-T forces other relations, e.g., S 41 = S 42 . In summary, the
[S ] matrix can be deﬁned in terms of only seven parameters as follows:

The values computed by hp-FEM of some of the S -parameters obtained when exciting ports 3 and 4 are shown in
Tab. 1. Those values are compared with the corresponding ones obtained with a MM technique. Only the magnitudes
are shown; the S i j phase diﬀerence between the results delivered by the hp-FEM and MM is around 0.01◦ . Only four
signiﬁcant digits are shown in the table as the MM results are presumed to have no more than four digits of accuracy.
Note that S 43 = 0. This is the result obtained numerically (close to machine precision) with MM. Similar values
are provided by the hp-FEM. Note that scattering matrix does not correspond to a scattering matrix of a perfectly
compensated Magic-T, since our waveguide structure has intentionally been left uncompensated.
5. Conclusions
A hp-adaptive FE strategy has been employed for the simulation of a Magic-T structure. Computation of the
scattering matrix used to characterize the electromagnetic behavior of the Magic-T structure has been implemented as
a post-processing of the solution. Grids delivered by the hp-adaptive strategy indicate an optimal (or quasi-optimal)

results have been conﬁrmed by the excellent convergence curves, and the ﬁnal simulations which have a comparable
accuracy to those obtained with semi-analytical methods. At the same time, the hp-FEM maintains the ﬂexibility of
any FEM, which can easily account for diﬀerent geometries, materials, and construction or design artifacts.
