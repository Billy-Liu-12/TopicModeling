Abstract. In this paper, we apply multiple antennas to MB-OFDM
UWB system for high performance. With an emphasis on a preamble
design for multi-channel separation, we address the channel estimation
in MB-OFDM system with multiple antennas. By properly designing
each preamble for multiple antennas to be orthogonal in time domain,
the channel estimation can be applied to the MB-OFDM proposal for
IEEE 802.15.3a standard in the case of more than 2 transmit antennas.
By using the multi-antenna scheme and proposed channel estimation
technique, the reliability and performance of MB-OFDM system can be
improved.
Keywords: MB-OFDM, CAZAC, multiple antennas, channel estimation.

Introduction

Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is selected as a solution for the IEEE 802.15.3a
standard [1] for low cost and high performance wireless entertainment network
able to support streaming multimedia content and full motion video. In the standard of IEEE 802.15.3a, the data rate must be high enough (greater than 110
Mb/s) to satisfy a set of multimedia industry needs for wireless personal area
networks (WPAN) communication. The standard also address the quality of service (QoS) capabilities required to support multimedia data types [1]. Therefore,
higher rate and reliable transmission are required to satisfy the condition.
In this paper, as a solution for higher rate and reliable transmission, we apply
MIMO architectures using space-time block code (STBC) to MB-OFDM UWB
system. As an application of the MIMO architecture, a preamble structure for
employing STBC with more than 2 transmit antennas is designed to be orthogonal in the time domain, and the channel estimation performance based on an
investigated preamble structure is highlighted.

Space-Time Coded MB-OFDM System

In the WPAN system based on MB-OFDM, the whole available UWB spectrum
between 3.1-10.6GHz is divided into 14 sub-bands with 528MHz bandwidth [2].

The transmission rate of the MB-OFDM is between 53.3-480Mbps. In each subband, a normal OFDM modulated signal with 128 subcarriers is used. The main
diﬀerence between the MB-OFDM system and other narrowband OFDM systems
is the way that diﬀerent sub-bands are used in the transmission with several
hopping patterns.
As mentioned previously, for high performance of the system, we apply multiple antennas (2 and 4 transmit antennas and 1 receive antenna) to MB-OFDM
UWB system. In this paper, we use the STBC proposed by Alamouti [3].

Preamble Design for Multiple Antennas of MB-OFDM

In the STBC MB-OFDM system, the channel estimation is carried out for every
transmit antenna of the all sub-band. For the channel estimation of each antenna, we design preambles using the Zadoﬀ-Chu sequence, one of the constantamplitude zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequence, [4]. The sequence Ck is as
follows :
M πk 2
Ck = exp[j
]
(1)
N
where N is a length of preamble, and k = [0, 1, ..., N − 1]. M is an integer
relatively prime to N , and we consider the case of M is 1.
Ck has the property of a periodic autocorrelation function that is zero everywhere except at a single maximum per period. In the MB-OFDM system, The
length of the channel estimation sequence is 128 except zero-padded suﬃx and
guard interval. By using Ck of 64-symbol length (N = 64), we design the extended 128-length Zadoﬀ-Chu sequence with zero-padding. The extended ZadoﬀChu sequence is as follows:
S8m+n+1 =

C4m+n f or m : even including zero
0
f or m : odd

(2)

where m ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., 15}, n ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., 7}. Fig. 1 shows the structure of
preambles. In order to apply 4 transmit antennas, 4 preambles can be designed
by cyclic shift. For 2 transmit antennas, P1 and P3 preambles are used, and for
4 transmit antennas, all preambles are used.
From [5], we deduce generalized relation to determine the number of distinguishable paths D as follows:
1≤D≤

L
Nt

(3)

where L indicates the symbol-length of sequence, and Nt is the number of transmit antenna.
The orthogonality of preambles is broken and the preamble is not suitable
for MB-OFDM speciﬁcation, when the system just uses 64-symbol length sequence. However, extended sequences will keep the property of the orthogonality
at channel model (CM) 1 and 2 when the system uses 2 and 4 transmit antennas. It is noted that D is 64 for Nt =2 and is 32 for Nt =4 from (3). Using the

orthogonality, the receiver can execute the channel estimation and separate channel impulse response (CIR) of each transmit antenna.

Performance Evaluation and Discussion

The performance of the proposed preamble is evaluated in terms of MSE and
BER in this section. Fig. 2 (a) shows the MSE performance of 2 and 4 transmit
antennas at CM 1-4 [6]. In the case of 2 and 4 transmit antennas of CM 1
and 2 transmit antennas of CM2, the system can keep the orthogonality of
preambles. However, in the other cases, MSE performances are very poor because
the orthogonality of preamble is broken because of the reason that mentioned
through (3) in section 3.
Fig. 2 (b) shows the eﬀect of the number of transmit antennas on the BER
performance. Simulations are executed in conditions which are 1, 2 and 4 trans0.01

mit antennas at data rate 320, 400 and 480Mbps. Simulation results show that
multi-antenna systems have the better performance than single antenna system
and also as the number of antennas increases, the system has the better BER
performance.

Conclusions

In this paper, we apply space-time architecture to MB-OFDM system based on
WPAN for high capacity transmission and propose the new preamble structure
for channel estimation which is required in MIMO architecture. Through the
MSE performance, simulation results have shown that the proposed sequence
can be adopted to multi-antenna MB-OFDM system. The BER performance
shows that the reliability of STBC MB-OFDM system is improved eﬃciently
by increasing the number of antennas. As the new preamble is applied, it has
been shown that the MB-OFDM system with multi-antenna can achieve the high
transmission capacity.
