Abstract. This paper focuses on the derivation of the message complexity when two mobile ad hoc network (MANET) groups merge together, where the network groups already have been conﬁgured with
IP addresses by using address autoconﬁguration protocols (AAPs). The
message complexity of the MANET group merging case (GMC) in Strong
DAD, Weak DAD with proactive routing protocols (WDP), Weak DAD
with on-demand routing protocols (WDO), and MANETconf has been
derived respectively. In order to verify the derived bounds, analytical
simulations that quantify the message complexity of the address autoconﬁguration process based on the diﬀerent conﬂict probabilities are
conducted.
Keywords: Mobile Ad hoc Networks, Group Merge, Address Autoconﬁguration, Message Complexity.

Introduction

Clustering (or grouping) of mobile nodes provides eﬀective and eﬃcient means to
control routing and addressing in MANETs. In MANET, as the network grows
(including more nodes) if hierarchical routing schemes are applied the control
overhead is known to increase in a scalable fashion compared to using ﬂat routing techniques. Due to this reason, several hierarchical routing protocols have
been developed to enable scalable MANET routing solutions [1]. Due to the
lack of any centralized control and possible node mobility in MANETs, many
issues at the network, medium access, and physical layers currently remain as
research topics since no counterparts in the wired networks or cellular networks
can satisfy MANET requirements. One of the main criteria in determining eﬃciency in MANETs is the scalability of the control signaling. This issue becomes
even more serious when MANET groups merge, as the addressing and new route
establishment is required for multiple nodes simultaneously [2,3,4,5]. In mobile
IPv6 networks, a mobile node can select its own IP address (using the subnet’s preﬁx) but needs to obtain conﬁrmation from the subnetwork before being
permitted to use the chosen address. The conﬁrmation process is based on a duplicated address detection (DAD) operation. The DAD operation is one of the

most important processes of address autoconﬁguration. Currently, Weak DAD,
Strong DAD, and MANETconf have been proposed as candidate algorithms for
DAD address autoconﬁguration [6, 7]. The broadcast storm problem introduced
in [8] is a serious problem in MANET operations, and hence several algorithms
are introduced in [9] to reduce the number of broadcast messages. The authors
of [9] conclude that ﬁnding a minimum ﬂood tree which gives the minimum
number of forward nodes is proven to be a NP-complete problem, where the
minimum ﬂood tree is derived in [10]. In order to provide scalability, adaptability, and autonomy, Shen proposes the Cluster-based Topology Control (CLTC)
algorithm [11] that uses a clustering strategy as well as a topology control algorithm with help of changing the transmission power. Shen uses the message
complexity to statistically measure the performance of the CLTC protocol. The
authors in [1] calculate the storage complexity and communication complexity
to analyze the scalability of various MANET routing protocols and introduce
the routing overhead of periodically updated Link State (LS) messages, which
is known to follow the order of O(N 2 ), where N indicates the number of nodes
in a MANET. However, a message complexity analysis and comparison among
the IP address autoconﬁguration protocols for MANET GMC has not been conducted yet. Therefore, in this paper, the upper bounds of the message complexity
of the IP address autoconﬁguration protocols for MANETs are derived for the
GMC. In order to verify the derived bounds, analytical simulations that quantify the message complexity of the address autoconﬁguration process based on
the diﬀerent conﬂict probabilities are conducted. In addition, the acronyms of
messages and nomenclatures of the retry count variables used in this paper are
summarized in Table 1.

Message Complexity Analysis

A MANET can be represented as an undirected graph G(V, E) where V is a ﬁG
nite nonempty set of nodes, which can be represented as V = {V1G , V2G , · · · , VW
}
where |V| = W and E is a collection of pairs of distinct nodes from V that form
G
} [12]. A connected,
a link, which can be represented as E = {E1G , E2G , · · · , EW
acyclic, undirected graph which contains all nodes is deﬁned as a free tree. V
can be partitioned into several subgraphs V 1 , V 2 , · · · , V k , · · · , V n where each

322

S.-C. Kim

partition subgraph is called as a free tree and |V 1 | + |V 2 | + · · · + |V n | = W . A
partitioned subgraph V k is represented as a free tree P (V, E), in which a node
set V is represented as V1 , V2 , · · · , VN and |V | equals N containing all nodes in
the partitioned subgraph V k , where N ≤ W .
In this paper, the most common ﬂooding method is used to broadcast an
AQ message where every node retransmits an AQ message to its entire one-hop
neighbors whenever it receives the ﬁrst copy of the AQ message. Since each
member node in a free tree will relay the AQ message initiated at node V i , the
maximum number of nodes relaying an AQ message is N -1, where the rule of
discarding duplicated messages at a node is adopted. Therefore, the maximum
number of AQ messages broadcasted or relayed in the free tree is N , which can
be represented as O(N ). The variable t is deﬁned as the largest number of nodes
in a communication path based on the routing tree, including the source node.
Deﬁnition 1. For a MANET routing tree with t nodes in the maximum length
path, O(t) is the upper bound of the maximum number of unicasted or relayed
AP messages when a node unicasts an AP message.
In order to analyze the GMC, a scenario is considered where two MANET groups
V i and V j , where |V i | = N1 , |V j | = N2 , and N1 ≤ N2 , merge into each other
and a node in the V i ﬁnds an IP address that is duplicated in the V j based on
a routing message such as Hello received (Strong DAD), or based on the LS,
RQ, or RR message received (Weak DAD). It is assumed that in order to include
the ﬁelds of P artition Identity(P I) and the number of nodes (N1 or N2 ), the
routing message is modiﬁed in each group for Strong DAD, or LS, RQ, or RR
message is modiﬁed for Weak DAD. All nodes of a group know their group’s
P I (Lowest IP, UUID), where the U niversal U nique ID (UUID) is the MAC
address of the lowest IP address node. When the two nodes I and J associated
in two diﬀerent groups become neighboring nodes to each other, two nodes I and
J detect the merger of two diﬀerent MANET groups with help of the routing
message or LS, RQ, or RR message.
In order to analyze the GMC with Strong DAD, since the message complexity of the V j is deﬁned as n(mO(N1 + N2 ) + O(t)) as shown in Fig. 1(a),
in the worst case, N1 nodes in the V i need to verify their IP addresses in a
merged MANET. The message complexity of the GMC can be represented as
nN1 (mO(N1 + N2 ) + O(t)), where each node in the V i generates the message
complexity of n(mO(N1 + N2 ) + O(t)), which concludes the following corollary.
Corollary 1. nN1 (mO(N1 + N2 ) + O(t)) is the upper bound of the maximum
number of broadcasted/relayed AQ messages and unicasted/relayed AP messages
of the GMC with Strong DAD.
Since the message complexity in the V i and V j caused by a node in the V i has
been deﬁned as n(O(N1 +N2 )+O(t)) and n(O(N1 +N2 )+2O(t)) as shown in Fig.
1(b), in the worst case, N1 nodes in the V i need to verify their IP addresses in a
merged MANET. Therefore, the message complexity of the GMC can be represented as N1 (n(O(N1 + N2 ) + O(t))) in WDP and N1 (n(O(N1 + N2 ) + 2O(t))) in

WDO where each node in the V i generates the message complexity of n(O(N1 +
N2 ) + O(t)) in WDP and n(O(N1 + N2 ) + 2O(t)) in WDO. Based on the results,
the following corollary can be derived.
Corollary 2. nN1 (O(N1 + N2 ) + O(t)) (WDP) and nN1 (O(N1 + N2 ) + 2O(t))
(WDO) are the upper bounds of the maximum number of broadcasted/relayed LS
messages and unicasted/relayed AE messages of the GMC using WDP.
In the GMC of MANETconf, based on the ﬂowchart as shown in Fig. 1(c), when
the two nodes I and J associated in two diﬀerent groups, which are V i and
V j respectively, become neighboring nodes to each other, they exchange their
P artition Identities. The nodes I and J can detect the merger of two diﬀerent
groups when the two nodes (I and J of each group) exchange their AL sets of IP
addresses, which must contain the group’s P I. Since the AL message is composed
of a list of IP addresses of a group, the size of AL message could be larger than the
maximum transfer unit (MTU) permitted in the MANET. It is assumed that
in the worst case, the required MTU is small where each AL message packet
contains only a single IP address (and overhead of the upper layers). Therefore,
in the upper bound case, an AL message from V j is segmented into N2 number
of MTU sized messages and transmitted in V i . In addition, the AL message
from V j is segmented into N1 number of MTU sized messages and transmitted
in V j . The algorithm requires all nodes in V i to broadcast the AL messages
transferred from V j , and all nodes in V i have to broadcast N2 number of AL
messages. As a result, the message complexity can be represented as N2 O(N1 ).
Likewise, all nodes in V j need to broadcast the AL messages transferred from
V i , and therefore, all nodes in the V j have to broadcast N1 number of AL
messages. As a result, the message complexity can be represented as N1 O(N2 ).
Therefore, the message complexity due to broadcasting the AL messages in V i
and V j can be represented as N1 O(N2 ) + N2 O(N1 ). The duplicated address
node with the higher P I will become the Requestor asking its neighboring node
to become its Initiator. Among the duplicated addresses nodes, the node of the
group that has the higher P I (i.e., comparing the lowest IP address of each group
ﬁrst, and if needed, also by comparing the UUID of each group) will become the
Requestor which chooses one of its neighbors with a non-conﬂicting address as
its Initiator to send an IQ message. Any nodes detecting conﬂicted IP addresses
become Initiators, where each Initiator broadcasts an IQ message to all nodes
of the group with the address of the Requester. The message complexity upper
bound of broadcasting IQ messages can be represented as O(N1 + N2 ) since the
IQ message is broadcasted into the merged MANET. Recipient nodes will reply
with an aﬃrmative or a negative response (using IR message) to the Initiator.
Therefore, the message complexity upper bound of unicasting IR messages can
be represented as O(t(N1 + N2 )) since all nodes (N1 + N2 ) unicast the IR
message and each IR message has the message complexity upper bound of O(t)
based on Deﬁnition 1. If the initiator receives positive IR messages from all
recipient nodes, it broadcasts an AO message to all recipient nodes of the group.
The message complexity upper bound of broadcasting the AO message can be
represented as O(N1 + N2 ). Therefore, the following corollary can be derived.

Message Complexity Analysis of MANET Address

325

Corollary 3. In an IP veriﬁcation procedure of the GMC, O((t+1)(N1 +N2 )) is
the upper bound of the maximum number of broadcasted or relayed IQ messages
and unicasted or relayed IR messages when a node needs to verify its IP address
in a MANET.
If the initiator receives any negative IR messages from its recipient nodes, it
selects another IP address and repeats the steps of broadcasting IQ and receiving
IR messages until the retry count reaches the retry count limit (n). Therefore,
the message complexity of broadcasting AO messages and receiving IR messages
until the retry count is less than n can be represented as n(O(N1 +N2 )+O(t(N1 +
N2 ))). After n times of repetition, if the initiator receives negative IR messages,
it sends an AB message to the requestor. The message complexity of unicasting
the AB message can be represented as O(1). Based on the above results, the
following corollary can be derived.
Corollary 4. In a session of a GMC, nO((t+1)(N1 +N2 ))+O(N1 +N2 )+O(1)
is the upper bound of the maximum number of broadcasted or relayed IQ and AO
messages and unicasted or relayed IR and AB messages in MANETconf.
The above session procedure per a duplicated address node should be repeated
until all duplicated address nodes are resolved. The repetition number of the
session procedure in a merged MANET is min(N1 , N2 ). Based on the above
results, the following corollary can be derived.
Corollary 5. In resolving all duplicated addresses of a GMC with MANETconf,
min(N1 , N2 ) {nO((t + 1)(N1 + N2 )) + O(N1 + N2 ) + O(1)} + O(2) + N1 O(N2 ) +
N2 O(N1 ) is the upper bound of the maximum number of messages.

Numerical Results

In order to analyze the message complexity of each AAP, a computer simulator
was developed where nodes are randomly distributed with uniform density in
a network area of 1km2 . A discrete-event simulator was developed in M atlab
in order to verify the various network topologies and to calculate the message
complexity of each AAP. The random node generator and simulator performance
was veriﬁed (for the numbers of nodes 100, 125, 150, and 175) so that the average
number of nodes per cluster as well as several specs in the adaptive dynamic
backbone (ADB) algorithm [11] matched with the results in [11], which was
performed by QualN et, with less than a 1% diﬀerence for almost all cases. In
our analysis, the conﬂict probability is deﬁned as the probability in which the
IP address that a node requests to use is already in use in the group. Dijkstra’s
shortest path algorithm at each node is used to calculate the number of hops in
unicasting or relaying an unicasted AP message from a destination node to a
source node. In the Strong DAD, ﬁve is used for retry count limit (n) and three
is used for DAD retry count limit (m). In the Weak DAD and MANETconf, ﬁve
is used for retry count limit (n) and one is used for DAD retry count limit (m).

In addition, 100m is selected as the transmission range of nodes. The number of
nodes is varied from 10 to 50. In Fig. 2, it can be observed that at the conﬂict
probability of 0.5 and 0.7, WDP has the smallest message complexity and Strong
DAD has the largest message complexity. In the range of 10 to 35 nodes at the
conﬂict probability of 0.9, and also for the case of 10 and 25 nodes at the conﬂict
probability of 1, WDP has the smallest message complexity and Strong DAD has
the largest message complexity in the GMC. In addition, it can be calculated that
with the increase of the conﬂict probability from 0.5 to 1, the maximum overhead
percentage of the message complexity of WDO increases gradually from 28.41%
to 35.96% and then decreases to 33.52 %, the maximum overhead percentage of
the message complexity of MANETconf is decreased from 318.10% to 232.48%
gradually, and the maximum overhead percentage of the message complexity of
Strong DAD decreases rapidly from 408.38% to 172.29 %.

Conclusion

The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel method to perform a quantitative analysis of message complexity and to compare the message complexity
among the MANET AAPs in the GMC. To conduct a quantitative analysis of
message complexity, the analysis of the worst case scenario is conducted in this
paper. By introducing the retry count limit (n) of a session in Strong DAD, the
possibility of resulting in an inﬁnite loop has been removed. By adapting the
mechanism of the replying AE message, the Weak DAD is equipped to properly
react when solving duplicated IP address situations. Based on the simulation results, when nominal n, m, t, N values and transmission range have been assigned
with p = 0.5 and 0.7, the message complexity can be compared as follows: WDP
< WDO < MANETconf < Strong DAD. However, for the case where the conﬂict probability is 0.9 or 1, the message complexity of the MANET GMC can be
compared as follows: WDP < WDO < Strong DAD < MANETconf. The results
of this paper provide a direct comparison of scalability of DAD schemes based
on MANET group merging cases. The methodology applied in this paper can
be used to analyze newly developed DAD schemes in the future, which is one of
the objectives that lead to conducting this research.
