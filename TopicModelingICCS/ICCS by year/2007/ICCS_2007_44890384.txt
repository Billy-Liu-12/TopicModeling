eulerian subgraph H with X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩ E(H) = ∅. We prove that
if G is (t + 2)-edge-connected and locally connected, then G is (2, t)supereulerian, or G belongs to a well characterized class of graphs.

Introduction

Graphs in this note are simple and ﬁnite. We follow the notation of Bondy and
Murty [2] unless otherwise stated. For a graph G, O(G) denotes the set of all
vertices of odd degree in G. A graph G with O(G) = ∅ is an even graph, and a
connected even graph is an eulerian graph. A graph is supereulerian if it has
a spanning eulerian subgraph. The collection of all supereulerian graphs will be
denoted by SL. For a graph G with a subgraph H, the contraction G/H is the
graph obtained from G by replacing H by a vertex vH , such that the number of
edges in G/H joining any v ∈ V (G) − V (H) to vH in G/H equals the number
of edges joining v in G to H. vH is nontrivial if E(H) = ∅. As in [2], the edgeconnectivity and the minimum degree of G are denoted by κ (G) and δ(G). For
an integer i ≥ 1, deﬁne Di (G) = {v ∈ V (G)|dG (v) = i}. A vertex v ∈ G is
called a locally connected vertex if G[NG (v)] is connected. A graph is a locally
connected if every v ∈ G is a locally connected.
For two integers s ≥ 0, t ≥ 0, G is (s, t)-supereulerian, if ∀X, Y ⊂ E(G),
with X ∩ Y = ∅, |X| ≤ s, |Y | ≤ t, G has a spanning eulerian subgraph H with
X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩ E(H) = ∅. Clearly, G is supereulerian if and only if G is (0,
0)-supereulerian. Since every supereulerian graph must be 2-edge-connected, it is
necessary that any (s, t)-supereulerian graph must be (t+ 2)-edge-connected. We
consider the problem of s = 2 and shall prove that if G is (t + 2)-edge-connected
and locally connected, then either G is (2, t)-supereulerian or G belongs to a well
characterized class of graphs. In [3], Catlin proved the following.

Theorem 1 (Catlin [3]). If G is connected and locally connected, then G ∈ SL.
The main purpose of this paper is to improve this theorem of Catlin on (0, 0)supereulerian graphs to (2, t)-supereulerian graphs.

Collapsible Graphs and Reduced Graphs

A graph is collapsible if for every set R ⊂ V (G) with |R| even, there is a
spanning connected subgraph HR of G, such that O(HR ) = R. Thus K1 is both
supereulerian and collapsible. Denote the family of collapsible graphs by CL.
Let G be a collapsible graph and let R =∅. Then by deﬁnition, G has a spanning
connected subgraph H with O(H) = ∅, and so G is supereulerian. Therefore, we
have CL ⊂ SL.
In [3], Catlin showed that every graph G has a unique collection of pairwise
disjoint maximal collapsible subgraphs H1 , H2 , ..., Hc . The contraction of G obtained from G by contracting each Hi into a single vertex (1 ≤ i ≤ c), is called
the reduction of G. A graph is reduced if it is the reduction of some other graph.
Theorem 2 (Lai [9]). Let G be a 2-edge-connected triangle-free simple graph
n
, then G ∈ SL.
on n > 30 vertices, if δ(G) > 10
Theorem 3 (Catlin, Theorem 8 of [3]). Let H be a collapsible subgraph of a
graph G, then G ∈ SL if and only if G/H ∈ SL.
Let F (G) denote the minimum number of extra edges that must be added to G
so that the resulting graph has 2-edge-disjoint spainning trees.
Theorem 4 (Catlin, Han and Lai, Lemma 2.3 of [6]). If G is reduced with
|V (G)| ≥ 3, then F (G) = 2|V (G)| − |E(G)| − 2.
Theorem 5 (Catlin, Theorem 7 of [4], Catlin, Han and Lai, Theorem 1.3 of [6]).
Let G be a connected reduced nontrivial graph. If F (G) ≤ 1, then G ∼
= K2 ; if
F (G) ≤ 2, then G ∈ {K1 , K2 , K2,t (t ≥ 1)}.
Theorem 6 (Caltin, Theorem 8 and Lemma 5 of [3]). If G is reduced, then G
4
is simple and contains no K3 . Moreover, if κ (G) ≥ 2, then i=2 |Di (G)| ≥ 4,
4
and when i=2 |Di (G)| = 4, G must be eulerian.

Main Result

Let G be a graph and let X ⊂ E(G). Deﬁne GX to be the graph obtained from
G by replacing each edge e ∈ X with end ue and ve by a (ue , ve )-path Pe of
length 2, where the internal vertex w(e) of the path Pe is newly added. We call
this process of replacing e by Pe an elementary subdivision of G on the edge e.
Lemma 7 below follows from the deﬁnitions.

Lemma 7. Let G be a graph and let X ⊂ E(G), Y ⊂ E(G) with X ∩ Y = ∅,
then G has a spanning eulerian graph H such that X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩E(H) = ∅
if and only if (G − Y )X ∈ SL.
Let G0 be the reduction of (G − Y )X . Let D21 denote the set of those vertices of
degree 2 newly created from subdividing edges of X, and let D22 = D2 (G0 ) − D21 .
Let d12 = |D21 |, d22 = |D2 (G0 )| − d12 .
Lemma 8. Let G be (t + 2)-edge-connected, then d22 ≤ 2.
Proof: Let v ∈ D22 and the two edges incident with v in G0 is an edge-cut in
(G − Y )X . Since G is (t + 2)-edge-connected, so at least t edges incident with v
are removed. Since in order to get three vertices that belong to D22 , at least 32 t
edges must be removed, by |Y | ≤ t, d22 ≤ 2.
Lemma 9. (Catlin, Lemma 1 of [7]) K3,3 − e is collapsible.
Theorem 10. Let s ≤ 2 and t ≥ 0 be two integers. G is a (t + 2)-edge-connected
locally connected graph on n vertices. For any X, Y ⊂ E(G) with X ∩ Y = ∅,
|X| ≤ s, |Y | ≤ t, exactly one of the following holds:
(i) G has a spanning eulerian graph H, such that X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩ E(H) =
∅. (e.g. G is (2, t)-supereulerian).
(ii) The reduction of (G − Y )X is a member of {K1 , K2 , K2,t (t ≥ 1)}.
Proof: Let G0 be the reduction of (G − Y )X . We consider these cases.
Case 1. F (G0 ) ≥ 3.
If |V (G0 )| ≥ 3, then by Theorem 4, we have
F (G0 ) = 2|V (G0 )| − |E(G0 )| − 2 ≥ 3.

Let dj = |Dj (G0 )|, j = 1, 2, · · ·. Since G is (t + 2)-edge-connected, G0 must be
2-edge-connected, and so

For any v ∈ D22 ∪ D3 , by Lemma 8, we have d22 ≤ 2. By (2), (d22 , d3 ) ∈ {(2, 1),
(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)}. In the following we will proceed our proof by considering
the possible values of t.
Subcase 1.1. t ≥ 3.
Then, |Y | = t ≥ 3. Take v ∈ D3 , as shown in the Lemma 8, the three edges
incident with v is an edge-cut of (G − Y )X . Since G is (t + 2)-edge-connected, at
least t − 1 edges incident with v are removed. Since in order to get three vertices
in D3 , at least 32 (t − 1) edges must be removed, by |Y | ≤ t and 32 (t − 1) ≥ t while
t ≥ 3, d3 ≤ 3.
When d3 = 3, at least 32 (t − 1) edges are removed. As 32 (t − 1) ≥ t (the equal
sign holds if and only if t = 3), we have d22 = 0. By (2), it is a contradiction.
Similarly, d3 = 2 implies d22 ≤ 1. It contradicts to (2).
If d3 = 1, by Lemma 8, d22 ≤ 2, (2) can’t hold.
So, when F (G0 ) ≥ 3 and κ (G) ≥ 5, |V (G0 )| ≤ 2. If |V (G0 )| = 2, G0 is simple,
and so we must have G0 ∼
= K2 . So at least t + 1 edges are removed. It contradicts
to |Y | ≤ t. Thus |V (G0 )| = 1, G0 ∈ SL.
Subcase 1.2. t = 2.
Similarly, if D3 ≥ 5, then at least 52 (t − 1) edges must be removed, and so
2 = t ≥ |Y | ≥ 52 (t − 1), contrary to the fact that t = 2. This shows that d3 ≤ 4.
If d3 = 2, by (2), d22 ≥ 2. But by Lemma 8, when d22 = 2, we must remove t
edges in Y. This contradicts to d3 = 2. So, d3 = 2 is impossible.
Similarly, if d3 = 3, by (2), d22 ≥ 2. As the discussion above, that contradicts
to d3 = 3. Hence d3 = 3 is impossible.
Note that when d3 = 4, d22 = 0. And by (2), d22 ≥ 1, another contradiction.
This shows that d3 = 4 is impossible.
As the shown in the Subcase 1.1, |V (G0 )| = 1, then G0 ∈ SL.
Subcase 1.3. t = 1.
Since G is locally connected, and κ (G) ≥ 3, so any v in G, there is a path
connecting its neibouring verties. Thus any v is in a triangle. By Theorem 6,
G0 has no K3 . So a locally connected graph will be reduced to K1 . Hence any
v ∈ D3 , any e in (G[N (v)]) is either divided or removed. Thus when s = 2, t = 1,
d3 = 2, G0 must be depicted as the graph in Figure 1.
Clearly, this gragh is (2, 1)-supereulerian.
When d3 = 3, since G is locally connected, G0 must have K3,3 − e. This
contradicts to Lemma 9. Thus d3 = 3 is impossible.
When d3 = 4, by Lemma 9, G0 has no K3,3 -e. So G0 must be depicted as
the graph in Figure 2. But v3 ∈ D3 , the edge in (G[N (v3 )]) incident with a and

b can’t be divided or removed. So, we get a contradiction. So G0 ∈ CL, thus
G ∈ SL.
If d3 > 4, K3,3 − e will appear. So, d3 ≤ 4.
Case 2. F (G0 ) ≤ 2.
By Theorem 5, G0 ∈ {K1 , K2 , K2,t (t ≥ 1)}. This proves Theorem 10.
