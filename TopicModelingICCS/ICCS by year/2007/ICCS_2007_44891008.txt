Abstract. With the longstanding development of Chinese petroleum enterprises,
the control of discovery and exploitation goal cost is becoming a essential
problem. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a linear programming method
for measuring the relative efficiency of decision making units where the
presence of multiple inputs and outputs makes comparisons difficult. Grey
Markovian model has the merits of both grey model and Markov transition
probability matrix model. In this paper, DEA and Grey Markovian model are
combined to measure the discovery and exploitation goal cost of petroleum
enterprise. This method is applied to the cost analysis of Huabei Oil Company
of PetroChina, which gives strong support to the feasibility and availability of
the study in this paper.

1 Introduction
Petroleum as a kind of non-renewable natural resource is crucial for the development
of economy. However, in accordance with the gradual decrease of resource, the
discovery and exploitation cost is rising. Cost management should be used to optimize
benefits. Most of the enterprises especially those with long history start to focus on
cost control in China. Therefore, the study on how to measure and predict the cost
accurately for the petroleum enterprise is quite important.
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric linear programmingbased method for measuring the relative efficiency of a decision making unit
(DMU), which contains multiple inputs and multiple outputs [1]. The CCR model
is the first DEA model and has been widely used in the frontier analysis. This
model calculates the overall efficiency for each unit, where both technical
efficiency and scale efficiency are aggregated into one value [2]. Grey Markovian
model combining the grey model and Markov probability matrix model makes full
use of historical data and improves the prediction accuracy of greatly fluctuating
data sequences [3]. In this paper, we proposed a method to measure discovery and
exploitation goal cost of petroleum enterprise by using DEA and Grey Markovian

model. Goal cost prediction of the Huabei Oil Company was taken to illustrate the
proposed model.

2 Measuring Discovery and Exploitation Goal Cost
According to the principles of DEA and Grey Markovian model with taking into
account the characteristics of the petroleum enterprise’s operation style, the discovery
and exploitation goal cost can be measured through following steps.
2.1 Calculating the Discovery and Exploitation Goal Cost Coefficients

X i is the discovery cost of the i th year; Yi is the exploitation cost
of the i th year; Qi is the proved reserve of the i th year; Wi is the crude oil output
of the i th year. we can evaluate the relative efficiencies of the discovery and
exploitation cost first by using the CCR model of DEA,. Then X i and Y j are

separately arranged in descending sequence according to their coefficients of relative
efficiency and we can get two data sequences: X j and Y j .

Where in (1) and (2), if n is an odd number, let n=n+1.
2.2 Forecasting the Proved Reserve and the Crude Oil Output
Grey Markovian model constructing process can be divided into three steps. First,
with GM (1, 1) model utilized, the stimulant sequence X (k ) and forecasting values
can be got on the basis of the original data sequence. Then X (k ) is considered as the
benchmark and divide the state into several areas with different curves paralleling
to X (k ) . Each area represents one state. Finally, through studying the state transition
probability matrix, we can decide the grey area of the forecasting value and regard the
midpoint of it as the most possible predictive value. Following the steps above, we
can forecast the proved reserve

Q ∗ and the crude oil output W ∗ .

2.3 Measuring the Discovery and Exploitation Goal Cost
Annual discovery goal cost:

X * = V1 * Q * .

Y * = V2 *W * .

Annual exploitation goal cost:

3 Illustrative Example
Huabei Oil Company of PetroChina has a long exploitation history. The decrease of
oil production and the increase of cost result in the reduction of its profit year after
year. The method mentioned above was applied to predict the goal cost of Huabei Oil
Company.
We arrange the discovery cost of the i th year ( X i ) from Table 1 in descending
sequence according to its coefficients of relative efficiency shown in Table 2. The
same method is used to arrange the exploitation cost of the i th year ( Yi ). According
to formula (1) and (2), the discovery goal cost coefficient ( V1 ) is 54.61 yuan/ton and
the exploitation goal cost coefficient ( V2 ) is 730.00 yuan/ton.
From the result shown in Table 3 and through analyzing the state transition
∗

probability matrix, the forecasting value of proved reserve in 2006 ( Q ) is 2350.22
(10,000-ton). In the same way, the forecasting result of crude oil output in 2006
∗

( W ) is 468.14 (10,000-ton). According to formula (3) and (4), the discovery goal
∗

∗

cost ( X ) and exploitation goal cost ( Y ) in 2006 can be predicted as 128345.51
(10,000-yuan) and 341742.20 (10,000-yuan) respectively.
