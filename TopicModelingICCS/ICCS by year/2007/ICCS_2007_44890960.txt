Abstract. Risks evaluation is critical for the success of IT outsourcing. It is
especially important in nuclear industry due to high concerns about safety and
service quality. This paper proposes a new integrated methodology, Variable
Precision Fuzzy Rough Group Decision-making (VPFRGDM), to evaluate the
risk in IT outsourcing. This method can improve fairness, flexibility and
efficiency of risk evaluation, and is verified by a case in a large-scale nuclear
power station.
Keywords: Risk evaluation VPFRGDM Nuclear industry.

1 Introduction
In China, nuclear industry is facing pressure of competition as the country’s energy
policy offers it no protection. Stations expect IT outsourcing to minimize costs and
improve efficiency. However, they have experienced many failed and undesirable
consequences, which are partially due to extremely high safety and service quality
requirements. It is urgent for the stations to find an advanced and practical
methodology to enhance competitive advantages with less cost and better IT service.
There have been many papers that have investigated IT outsourcing related risks.
Validated measures of risk factors based on Transaction Cost Theory (TCT) [1],
method to identify/assess risk [2]. However, papers mentioned above focus mainly on
analyzing framework or prioritization of risk, yet further emphasis is needed on
quantitative methodology. Additionally, the capability of handling potential error and
the efficiency of the approaches need improvement.
This paper proposes a new model called Variable Precision Fuzzy Rough Group
Decision-making (VPFRGDM) to evaluate IT outsourcing risk in the nuclear
industry. Firstly, historical knowledge is represented in a fuzzy decision table(FDT)
based on TCT; Then, based on VPFRS[3] and fuzzy TOPSIS approach[4], it
evaluates the risk under a certain admissible inclusion error βand the whole error
interval. The model further reduces the bias in fuzzy group decision-making (FGDM),
improves the efficiency in IT outsourcing risk decision-making.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed model in
detail. Section 3 provides a case of a synthetic evaluation of IT outsourcing risk.
Section 4 then provides the final concluding remarks and future work required.

2 The VPFRGDM Model
Let U be a non-empty set of finite objects (the universe of discourse). Consider a
fuzzy compatibility relation R, fuzzy set F and denote by Xi a compatibility class on
, the mean rough fuzzy βU. With a given admissible inclusion error
approximations μ R F ( X i ) is defined in [3].

Assume that there are a total of m conditional features, denoted by Ci (i=1, 2,…,
m), one decision feature, denoted by D; n evaluators and N possible alternatives. IT
outsourcing risk evaluation will be dealt with Fuzzy TOPSIS [4]. The proposed model
consists mainly of three steps:
Step 1: Calculate the weight of feature and evaluator
The weight of feature Ci will be:

WCβi = γ Cβi ( D) / ∑ γ Cβi ( D) i = 1,2,...m

where

γ Cβ ( D) = sup sup {μ R β F ( X j )} .

X j ∈U / Ci F∈U / D

Initially, each evaluator will give linguistic evaluation to each alternative and
linguistic evaluation is turned into Triangular Fuzzy Number(TFN) [5]. Then the
weight of each evaluator

WEβk (k=1,…, n) will be calculated by mutual distance

between TFN as shown in [6].

Step 2: Evaluate the risk of each alternative under a given

Step 3: Evaluate the risk on the whole admissible inclusion error interval [0, α ]

WCβi and WEβk are linear functions
β ~ ~*

3 A Numerical Case
The numerical case is from a famous nuclear power station in China, Nuclear Power
Company (NPC). The IT staff established the index system and generated FDT, as
shown in Table 1. In Table 1, ‘L’ , ‘M’ and ‘H’ represents ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’
respectively. Data is the membership of an object belongs to the class.

alternatives. Herein the threshold of inclusion error is α = 0.3 .

With the results in Table 2 compared, it is easy to see that the ranks of 1, 3, and 4
are varying. The reason of these variations is violent fluctuations in weights of
features when β is small. When β > 0.2, the evaluation turns to be stable and more
reasonable. It is evidence that the classification error and its associated negative
influence are under better control. The final result is clear and convincing, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the mean method to eliminate bias.

4 Conclusion
This paper aims at facilitating evaluation of IT outsourcing risk in the nuclear
industry, proposes a model to evaluate IT outsourcing risk. The model retains the
advantages of FGDM and improves fairness, flexibility, versatility and efficiency in
IT outsourcing risk measurement and decision-making, which is verified by the case
of the company NPC.
The model could also be generalized to other risk domains and GDM
methodology. Further research may be conducted in searching for fuzzy rules and
fuzzy reasoning in risk knowledge discovery in order to optimize the risk decisionmaking.
