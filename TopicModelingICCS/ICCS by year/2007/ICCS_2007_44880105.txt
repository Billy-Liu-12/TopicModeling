Abstract. One of the main problems in the radiosity method is how to
discretise a scene into mesh elements that allow us to accurately represent
illumination. In this paper we present a new reﬁnement criterion for
hierarchical radiosity based on the continuous and discrete generalised
mutual information measures between two patches or elements. These
measures, derived from the generalised entropy of Harvda-Charv´
at-Tsallis,
express the information transfer within a scene. The results obtained
improve on the ones based on kernel smoothness and Shannon mutual
information.

Introduction

The radiosity method solves the problem of illumination in an environment with
diﬀuse surfaces by using a ﬁnite element approach [1]. The scene discretisation
has to represent the illumination accurately by trying to avoid unnecessary subdivisions that would increase the computation time. A good meshing strategy
will balance the requirements of accuracy and computational cost.
In the hierarchical radiosity algorithms [2] the mesh is generated adaptively:
when the constant radiosity assumption on a patch is not valid for the radiosity
received from another patch, the reﬁnement algorithm will subdivide it in a set
of subpatches or elements. A reﬁnement criterion, called oracle, informs us if a
subdivision of the surfaces is needed, bearing in mind that the cost of the oracle
should remain acceptable. In [3,4], the diﬃculty in obtaining a precise solution
for the scene radiosity has been related to the degree of dependence between all
the elements of the adaptive mesh. This dependence has been quantiﬁed by the
mutual information, which is a measure of the information transfer in a scene.
In this paper, a new oracle based on the generalised mutual information [5],
derived from the generalised entropy of Harvda-Charv´at-Tsallis [6], is introduced. This oracle is obtained from the diﬀerence between the continuous and
discrete generalised mutual information between two elements of the adaptive
mesh and expresses the loss of information transfer between two patches due to
the discretisation. The results obtained show that this oracle improves on the
kernel smoothness-based [7] and the mutual information-based [8,9] ones, conﬁrming the usefulness of the information-theoretic approach in dealing with the
radiosity problem.

Preliminaries
Radiosity

The radiosity method uses a ﬁnite element approach, discretising the diﬀuse
environment into patches and considering the radiosities, emissivities and reﬂectances constant over them. With these assumptions, the discrete radiosity
equation [1] is given by
Bi = Ei + ρi
Fij Bj ,
(1)
j∈S

where S is the set of patches of the scene, Bi , Ei , and ρi , are respectively the
radiosity, emissivity, and reﬂectance of patch i, Bj is the radiosity of patch j,
and Fij is the patch-to-patch form factor, deﬁned by
Fij =

1
Ai

F (x, y)dAy dAx ,
Si

(2)

Sj

where Ai is the area of patch i, Si and Sj are, respectively, the surfaces of patches
i and j, F (x, y) is the point-to-point form factor between x ∈ Si and y ∈ Sj , and
dAx and dAy are, respectively, the diﬀerential areas at points x and y. Using
Monte Carlo computation with area-to-area sampling, Fij can be calculated:
Fij ≈ Aj

1
|Si×j |

F (x, y),

(3)

(x,y)∈Si×j

where the computation accuracy depends on the number of random segments
between i and j (|Si×j |).
To solve the system (1), a hierarchical reﬁnement algorithm is used. The
eﬃciency of this algorithm depends on the election of a good reﬁnement criterion. Many reﬁnement oracles have been proposed in the literature (see [10]
for details). For comparison purposes, we review here the oracle based on kernel smoothness (KS), proposed by Gortler et al. [7] in order to drive hierarchical
reﬁnement with higher-order approximations. When applied to constant approximations, this reﬁnement criterion is given by
ρi max{Fijmax − Fijavg , Fijavg − Fijmin }Aj Bj < ,

(4)

where Fijmax = max{F (x, y) | x ∈ Si , y ∈ Sj } and Fijmin = min{F (x, y) | x ∈
Si , y ∈ Sj } are, respectively, the maximum and minimum radiosity kernel values
estimated by taking the maximum and minimum value computed between pairs
of random points on both elements, and Fijavg = Fij /Aj is the average radiosity
kernel value.

HCT Entropy and Generalised Mutual Information

In 1967, Harvda and Charv´
at [6] introduced a new generalised deﬁnition of entropy. In 1988, Tsallis [11] used this entropy in order to generalise the BoltzmannGibbs entropy in statistical mechanics.

Deﬁnition 1. The Harvda-Charv´
at-Tsallis entropy (HCT entropy) of a discrete
random variable X, with |X| = n and pX as its probability distribution, is deﬁned
by
n
1 − i=1 pα

,
(5)
Hα (X) = k
α−1
where k is a positive constant (by default k = 1) and α ∈ \{1} is called entropic
index.

Ê

This entropy recovers the Shannon discrete entropy when α → 1, H1 (X) ≡
n
− i=1 pi ln pi , and fulﬁls good properties such as non-negativity and concavity.
On the other hand, Taneja [5] and Tsallis [12] introduced the generalised
mutual information.
Deﬁnition 2. The generalised mutual information between two discrete random
variables (X, Y ) is deﬁned by

(6)
Iα (X, Y ) =
α−1 α−1
1−α
p
q
i
j
i=1 j=1
where |X| = n, |Y | = m, pX and qY are the marginal probability distributions,
and pXY is the joint probability distribution between X and Y .
The transition of Iα (X, Y ) to the continuous generalised mutual information is
straightforward. Using entropies, an alternative form is given by
Iα (X, Y ) = Hα (X) + Hα (Y ) − (1 − α)Hα (X)Hα (Y ) − Hα (X, Y ).

(7)

Shannon mutual information (MI) is obtained when α → 1. Some alternative
ways for the generalised mutual information can be seen in [13].

Generalised Mutual Information-Based Oracle

We will see below how the generalised mutual information can be used to build
a reﬁnement oracle within a hierarchical radiosity algorithm. Our strategy will
be based on the estimate of the discretisation error from the diﬀerence between
the continuous and discrete generalised mutual information (6) between two
elements of the adaptive mesh. The discretisation error based on Shannon mutual information was introduced by Feixas et al. [8] and applied to hierarchical
radiosity with good results.
In the context of a discrete scene information channel [4], the marginal probabilities are given by pX = qY = {ai } (i.e., the distribution of the relative area
of patches: AATi , where AT is the total area of scene) and the joint probability is
given by pXY = {ai Fij }. Then,

This measure quantiﬁes the discrete information transfer in a discretised scene.
The term τα (ai Fij , ai aj ) can be considered as an element of the generalised
mutual information matrix Iα , representing the information transfer between
patches i and j.

The information transfer between two patches can be obtained more accurately using the continuous generalised mutual information between them. From
the discrete form (8) and using the pdfs p(x) = q(y) = A1T and p(x, y) =

AT F (x, y), we deﬁne

Deﬁnition 5. The generalised discretisation error of a scene is given by
Δα = Iαc − Iα =

(13)

i∈S j∈S

where Δαij = Iαc ij − Iαij .
While Δα expresses the loss of information transfer in a scene due to the discretisation, the term Δαij gives us this loss between two elements i and j. This
diﬀerence is interpreted as the beneﬁt to be gained by reﬁning and can be used
as the base of the new oracle.
From (13), using (9) and (12), we obtain

Accordingly to the radiosity equation (1) and in analogy to classic oracles,
like KS, we consider the oracle structure ρi σBj < , where σ is the geometric
kernel [14]. Now, we propose to take the generalised discretisation error between
two patches as the kernel (σ = Δαij ) for the new oracle based on generalised
mutual information (GMIα ). To simplify the expression of this oracle, we multiply
the inequality by the scene constant AT 2−α (1 − α).

Results

In this section, the GMIα oracle is compared with the KS and MI ones. Other
comparisons, with a more extended analysis, can be found in [14]. All oracles
have been implemented on top of the hierarchical Monte Carlo radiosity method.
In Fig. 1 we show the results obtained for the KS (a) and GMIα oracles with
their Gouraud shaded solutions and meshes. In the GMIα case, we show the
results obtained with the entropic indexes 1 (b) (i.e., note that GMI1 = MI) and
0.5 (c). For the sake of comparison, adaptive meshes of identical size have been
generated with the same cost for the power distribution: around 19,000 patches
and 2,684,000 rays, respectively. To estimate the form factor, the number of
random lines has been ﬁxed to 10.
In Table 1, we show the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Peak Signal
Noise Ratio (PSNR) measures for KS and GMIα (for 5 diﬀerent entropic indexes)
oracles for the test scene. These measures have been computed with respect
to the corresponding converged image, obtained with a path-tracing algorithm

especially in the much more deﬁned shadow of the chair on the right. Note the
superior quality mesh created by our oracle.

In general, the improvement obtained with the GMIα oracle is signiﬁcant.
Moreover, its behaviour denotes a tendency to improve towards subextensive
entropic indexes (α < 1). To observe this tendency, another test scene is shown in
Fig. 2 for an entropic index 0.5. Its corresponding RMSE and PSNR measures are
presented in Table 2. The meshes are made up of 10,000 patches with 9,268,000
rays to distribute the power and we have kept 10 random lines to evaluate the
oracle between elements.

Conclusions

We have presented a new generalised-mutual-information-based oracle for hierarchical radiosity, calculated from the diﬀerence between the continuous and discrete generalised mutual information between two elements of the adaptive mesh.
This measure expresses the loss of information transfer between two patches due
to the discretisation. The objective of the new oracle is to reduce the loss of
information, obtaining an optimum mesh. The results achieved improve on the
classic methods signiﬁcantly, being better even than the version based on the
Shannon mutual information. In all the tests performed, the best behaviour is
obtained with subextensive indexes.
