Abstract. In this paper, a grey model (GM) based profitable duration forecasting
approach is proposed for Chinese crude oil main production district. In this
methodology, the forecasting functions on electricity expenditure and crude oil
sales revenue are first built via GM. Based on these two forecasting functions, the
profitable duration of crude oil production under the restriction of the coefficient
of limit electricity cost is then worked out. Finally, some ways to prolong the
profitable duration are put forward in order to offer some valuable suggestions
for the transformation of resource-based cities.
Keywords: GM, profitable duration, crude oil, china, forecasting.

1 Introduction
Besides the ocean oil-fields, there are 19 land oil-fields in China. Among them, the
annual crude oil output of Daqing Oil Field occupies 1/4 of the Chinese land oil-fields’
output, which make Daqing a ‘weatherglass’ of Chinese crude oil market. Therefore,
the Daqing Oil Field is one of the main crude oil production districts in China.
As is known to us, crude oil is a non-renewable resource. Although Daqing Oil Field
Company actively explore outer petroleum resources, the crude oil output in Daqing
Oil Field decreases year by year with the continuous exploitation of crude oil. Along
with the exploitation, the moisture content of crude oil increases continuously. It results
in that the main variable costs of oil exploitation — electricity consumption increases
continuously, and thus leading to the increase of unit electricity consumption cost for
crude oil production. In such situations, some ideas are presented. For example, if crude
oil output decreases year by year, but electricity consumption increases year by year,
then there must be a certain year that the crude oil sales revenue cannot afford to
electricity expenditure in the Chinese crude oil main production district. Therefore this
time point is extremely important for the sustainable development of resource-based
cities. As earlier noted, beyond this time point, the crude oil output of crude oil main
production districts will be no meaningful because the oil output after this time point
will not bring any profits.
As we know, the Chinese crude oil main production districts such as Daqing and
Yumen are the common resource-based cities. In order to keep the sustainable
development of these resource-based cities, it is necessary to forecast the profitable
duration. With this profitable duration, we can provide time basis for the

resource-based cities’ transformation and development strategies, which is the main
motivation of this study.
The rest of this study is organized as follows. The next section describes the basic
principle of calculating the profitable duration method. In Section 3, a practical
example is given to present the computing process of the proposed methodology.
Finally, some important ways to prolong the profitable duration and some valuable
suggestions to the transformation-oriented resource-based cities are presented in
Section 4.

2 Basic Principle for Profitable Duration Computation
Usually, the profitable duration of a main crude oil production district is defined as a
time period that the crude oil sales revenues are larger than the electricity consumption
expenditure for a certain crude oil production district. From this definition, our goal is
to calculate the duration. For this purpose, we apply the limit electricity cost coefficient
to arrive at this goal.
Generally, the limit electricity cost coefficient can be represented by
Electricity expenditure

= Coefficient of limit electricity cost

(1)

Crude oil sales revenue

In the Equation (1), crude oil sales revenue and electricity expenditure are the future
values and thus both oil sales revenue and electricity consumption expenditure are the
function of time t. As Section 1 implied, the two functions are monotonic functions.
Therefore, the time curves of the two functions may be intersected, the intersecting time
is the non-profit time point. The time period covered from current to non-profit time
point is the profitable duration. So far, our main task is to predict the non-profit time
point.
From the above analysis, the key to the profitable duration is how to construct the
crude oil sales revenue function and electricity consumption expenditure function
regarding the time t. For this, we applied to grey model proposed by Deng [1] to
construct the above two functions. For grey model, interested readers can refer to Deng
[1] for more details.
The generic idea of calculating the profitable duration for crude oil main production
district is composed of the following steps.
Step I: using grey forecasting model GM (1, 1) to obtain time function of annual
crude oil output x and annual electricity consumption y : x ( k + 1) and y ( k + 1) .
Step II: according to the statistical data, average oil unit price γ , unit industry
electricity price β , and estimated value of limit electricity cost coefficient λ , are
obtained.

function can be represented by β × y ( k + 1) and the crude oil sales revenue function

can be expressed as γ × x ( k + 1) .
Step IV: In terms of Equation (1) and limit electricity cost coefficient λ , we can

construct the following equation λ × γ × x ( k + 1) = β × y ( k + 1) to obtain the
non-profit time point. Thus the profitable duration can be obtained.

For testing the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, we use Daqing Oil Field as a
typical example to predict the profitable duration in the following section.

3 An Illustrative Example
In order to illustrate the above computational principle, we select Daqing Oil Field as a
typical example to interpret the process of the calculating the profitable duration.
Because Daqing Oil Field is the largest oil field of China and a main crude oil
production district, selecting it as a representative is rather realistic. According to the
current situation, we only collect the following data from Daqing Oil Field Co.Ltd [2],
as shown in Table 1.

Due to the fact that the data are not enough and the existing data show monotonicity,
the traditional statistical models are not used. To overcome the data shortage, this paper
uses grey forecasting model GM(1,1), to fit forecast functions of annual crude output
and annual electricity consumption respectively.
3.1 Annual Crude Oil Output Forecasting

According to the GM, the forecast differential equation of the annual crude oil output
can be represented as:

According to integral principle, Equation (2) can be transformed into the following

In term of least squares method, the coefficients of the Equation (3) are obtained:
(0)

a = 0.04583 , b = 5613.26 , x (1) = 5535
Thus the forecast equations of annual crude oil output can be expressed as:
x ( k + 1) = −116939e

x ( k + 1) = x ( k + 1) − x ( k ) ( k = 1, 2 " , n )

Combining (4) and (5) , the final forecasting equation can be given as:

Δ 6 = 0.00087=0.087%<0.01
Therefore, the precision is realistic, and Equation (6) can be used to annual crude oil
output prediction.
3.2 Annual Electricity Consumption Forecasting

Similar to Section 3.1, the Forecast differential equation of annual electricity
consumption can be written as:

Similarly, we can calculate the parameter values using least squares method:
p = −0.024330 , q = 387808 , y (1) = 389542

Using the parameter value, Equation (8) can be written as:
y ( k + 1) = 16329041e

Therefore, the precision is also realistic, and formula (11) can be used for annual
electricity consumption prediction.
3.3 Presentation of the Average Industry Electricity Price, Average Oil Price and
the Limit Electricity Cost Coefficient

Because the purpose of this paper is to forecast the profitable duration of the crude oil
main production district in China, we directly give the average industry electricity price
estimate function and average oil price estimate function according to the data provided
by the Daqing Oil Field Co. Ltd [2] and Heilongjiang Electric Power Co., Ltd [3]:

β = 0.52 × 1.046 (RMB / KWh)
k

γ = 562.137 × 0.09334

After consulting with financial staff in Daqing Oil-Field Company, maximum
estimate value of limit electricity cost coefficient that electricity expenditure occupies
the crude oil sales revenue: λ =1/3 is offered.
3.4 Computation of Profitable Duration

From Section 2, the forecasting functions of the electricity consumption cost and crude
oil sales revenue can be expressed by
E ( k + 1) = β × y ( k + 1)

(12)

Q ( k + 1) = γ × x ( k + 1)

( 0)

According to Equation (1), one has

λ × Q ( 0) ( k + 1) = E (0 ) ( k + 1)

(14)

According to the previous work, we have the following form:

−116939(e

-0.04583k

− e -0.04583(k −1) ) × 562.137 × 0.09334 k × 1 / 3

Fig. 1. The time changing of limit electricity cost and electricity cost of the crude oil main
production district in China

Equation (15) can be solved by Matlab 6.5, the illustration of the two curves can be
shown in Fig. 1.
From Matlab computation and Fig. 1, we can obtain that the intersecting point
is k ≈ 93 . The forecast result shows that the profitable duration of Daqing Oil Field,
one crude oil main production district in China, is about 93 years since 2000 if no
actions are taken.

4 Concluding Remarks
In this study, we utilize GM-based model to predict the profitable duration of Chinese
crude oil main production district and obtained a good result. As we know, the crude oil
main production district in China takes oil industry as its leading industry. If the oil
industry continues developing with the existing crude oil output and electricity
consumption mode, it will be non-profitable for the crude oil output after hundreds of
years, and thus it will also seriously influence and restrict the existence and
development of resource-based cities. According to Equation (1), the key to prolong
profitable duration is to increase crude oil output, reduce electricity consumption and
decrease limit electricity cost coefficient. Through these ways, it can provide more
transformation time for resource-based cities.
