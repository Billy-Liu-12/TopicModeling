Abstract. A new method for determining knots in parametric curve
interpolation is presented. The determined knots have a quadratic polynomial precision in the sense that an interpolation scheme which reproduces quadratic polynomials would reproduce parametric quadratic
polynomials if the new method is used to determine knots in the interpolation process. Testing results on the eﬃciency of the new method are
also included.
Keywords: parametric curves, knots, polynomials.

Introduction

The problem of constructing parametric interpolating curves is of fundamental
importance in CAGD, CG, scientiﬁc computing and so on. The constructed curve
is often required to have a better approximation precision and as well as to have
the shape suggested by the data points.
The construction of an ideal parametric interpolating curve requires not only
a good interpolation method, but also appropriate choice of the parameter knots.
In parametric curve construction, the chord length parametrization is a widely
accepted and used method to determine knots [1][2]. Other two useful methods
are centripetal model[3] and adjusted chord length method ([4], referred as Foley’s method). When these three methods are used, the constructed interpolant
can only reproduce straight lines. In paper[5], a new method for determining
knots is presented (referred as ZCM method). The knots are determined using
a global method. The determined knots can be used to construct interpolants
which reproduce parametric quadratic curves if the interpolation scheme reproduces quadratic polynomials.
A new method for determining knots is presented in this paper. The knots associated with the points are computed by a local method. The determined knots
have a quadratic polynomial precision. Experiments showed that the curves constructed using the knots by the new method generally has the better interpolation precision.
The remaining part of the paper is arranged as follows. The basic idea of the
new method is described in Section 2. The choice of knots by constructing a

parametric quadratic interpolant to four data points is discussed in Section 3.
The comparison of the new method with other four methods is performed in
Section 4. The Conclusions and Future Works is given in Section 5.

Basic Idea

Let Pi = (xi , yi ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, be a given set of distinct data points which satisﬁes
the condition that for any point Pi , 1 < i < n, there are at least two sets of four
consecutive convex data points, which include it. As an example, for the data
points in Figure 3, the point Pi+1 belongs the two sets of consecutive convex data
points which are {Pi−2 , Pi−1 , Pi , Pi+1 } and {Pi , Pi+1 , Pi+2 , Pi+3 }, respectively.
The goal is to construct a knot ti for each Pi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The constructed knots
satisfy the following the condition: if the set of data points are taken from a
parametric quadratic polynomial, i.e.,
Pi = Aξi2 + Bξi + C,

1≤i≤n

(1)

where A = (a1 , a2 ), B = (b1 , b2 ) and C = (c1 , c2 ) are 2D points, then
ti − ti−1 = α(ξi − ξi−1 ),

1≤i≤n

(2)

for some constant α > 0.
Such a set of knots ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is known to have a quadratic polynomial precision. Obviously, using the knots satisfying equation (2), an interpolation scheme which reproduces quadratic polynomials will reproduce parametric
quadratic polynomials.
Following, the basic idea in determining the knots ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, will be described. If the set of data points is taken from a parametric quadratic polynomial,
P (ξ) = (x(ξ), y(ξ)) deﬁned by
x(ξ) = X2 ξ 2 + X1 ξ + X0 ,
y(ξ) = Y2 ξ 2 + Y1 ξ + Y0 ,

(3)

then, there is a rotating transformation to transform it to the following parabola
form, as shown in Figure 1:
y¯ = a1 t2 + b1 t + c1 ,
x¯ = t

(4)

Then the knots ti , 1 ≤ i ≤ n can be deﬁned by
ti = x
¯i ,

i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n,

which has a quadratic polynomial precision. Assume that the following transformation
x
¯ = x cos β2 + y sin β2
y¯ = −x sin β2 + y cos β2
transforms P (ξ) (3) to the parabola (4), then we have the following theorem 1.

Theorem 1. If the set of data points is taken from a parametric quadratic
polynomial,P (ξ) (3), then the knot ti , i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n which have a quadratic
polynomial precision, can be deﬁned by
t1 = 0
ti = ti−1 + (xi − xi−1 ) cos β2 + (yi − yi−1 ) sin β2 ,
where

i = 2, 3, · · · , n

sin β2 = −X2 / X22 + Y22
cos β2 = Y2 / X22 + Y22

(5)

(6)

Proof. In the x
¯y¯ coordinate system, it follows from (3) that
x
¯ = (X2 ξ 2 + X1 ξ + X0 ) cos β2 + (Y2 ξ 2 + Y1 ξ + Y0 ) sin β2
y¯ = −(X2 ξ 2 + X1 ξ + X0 ) sin β2 + (Y2 ξ 2 + Y1 ξ + Y0 ) cos β2

(7)

If sin β2 and cos β2 are deﬁned by (6), then the ﬁrst expression of (7) becomes
ξ=

x
¯ + X0 cos β2 + Y0 sin β2
X1 cos β2 + Y1 sin β2

(8)

Substituting (8) into the second expression of (7) and rearranging, a parabola
is obtained, which is deﬁned by
¯2 + b1 x
¯ + c1 ,
y¯ = a1 x
where a1 , b1 and c1 are deﬁned by
a1 = Y2 cos β2 − X2 sin β2
b1 = −2a1 AB + (Y1 cos β2 − X1 sin β2 )A
c1 = a1 A2 B 2 − (Y1 cos β2 − X1 sin β2 )AB + Y0 cos β2 − X0 sin β2
Thus, ti can be deﬁned by x
¯i , i.e., the knot ti ,i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n can be deﬁned by
(5), which has a quadratic polynomial precision.

The discussion above showed that the key point of determining knots is to
construct the quadratic polynomial, P (ξ) = (x(ξ), y(ξ)) (3) using the given data
points. This will be discussed in Section 3.

Determining Knots

In this section, we ﬁrst discuss how to construct a quadratic polynomial with four
points, then discuss the determination of knots using the quadratic polynomial.
3.1

Constructing a Quadratic Polynomial with Four Points

Let Qi (ξ) be a parametric quadratic polynomial which interpolates Pi−1 , Pi and
Pi+1 . Qi (ξ) can be deﬁned on the interval [0, 1] as follows:
Qi (s) = ψ1 (s)(Pi−1 − Pi ) + ψ2 (s)(Pi+1 − Pi ) + Pi

(9)

(s − si )(s − 1)
si
s(s − si )
ψ2 (s) =
1 − si

(10)

where

ψ1 (s) =

where 0 < si < 1.
Expressions (9) and (10) show that four data points are needed to determine
a parametric quadratic polynomial uniquely.
Let Pj = (xj , yj ), i − 1 ≤ j ≤ i + 2, be four points in which there are no three
points on a straight line. The Pi+2 will be used to determine si (10) .
Without loss of generality, the coordinates of Pi−1 , Pi , Pi+1 and Pi+2 are
supposed to be (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0) and (xi+2 , yi+2 ), respectively, as shown in
Figure 2. In the xy coordinate system, Qi (s) deﬁned by (9) becomes
x = s(s − si )/(1 − si )
y = (s − si )(s − 1)/si

(11)

Let si+2 be the knot associated with the point (xi+2 , yi+2 ). As point (xi+2 , yi+2 )
is on the curve, we have
xi+2 = si+2 (si+2 − si )/(1 − si )
yi+2 = (si+2 − si )(si+2 − 1)/si

(12)

It follows from (12) that
si+2 = xi+2 + (1 − xi+2 − yi+2 )si

(13)

Substituting (13) into (12), one gets the following equation:
s2i + A(xi+2 , yi+2 )si + B(xi+2 , yi+2 ) = 0

(14)

As si+2

si =

xi+2 + yi+2 − 1

(15)

It follows from (9)−(10) that if the given data points are taken from a parametric
quadratic polynomial Q(t), then there is an unique si satisfying 0 < si < 1
to make the curve Qi (s) (9) pass through the given data points. Since si is
determined uniquely by (15), Qi (s) is equivalent to Q(t).
Substituting si+2 > 1 into (11) one obtains
xi+2 > 1 and yi+2 > 0,

(16)

that is, the point (xi+2 , yi+2 ) should be on the dotted region in Figure 2.
3.2

Determining Knots

After si being determined, Qi (s) (9) can be written as

where

xi (s) = Xi,2 s2 + Xi,1 s + Xi,0 ,
yi (s) = Yi,2 s2 + Yi,1 s + Yi,0 ,

It follows from Theorem 1 that for i = 2, 3, · · · , n−2, the knot interval tj+1 −tj =
Δij between Pj and Pj+1 , j = i − 1, i, i + 1 can be deﬁned by
Δij = (xj+1 − xj ) cos βi + (yj+1 − yj ) sin βi ,

j = i − 1, i, i + 1

Based on the deﬁnition (19) that for the pair of P1 and P2 , there is one knot
interval Δ21 ; for the pair of P2 and P3 , there are two knot intervals, Δ22 and Δ32 ;
for the pair of Pi and Pi+1 , 3 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, there are three knot intervals, Δi−1

Fig. 3. Example 1 of the data points

For the data points as shown in Figure 3, as the data points change its convexity, the knot interval between Pi and Pi+1 is deﬁned by the combination of
Δii−1 and Δii+1 , i.e, by
(21)
Δi = (Δii−1 + Δii+1 )/2.
While for data points as shown in Figure 4, the knot intervals are determined by
subdividing the data points at point Pi+1 into two sets of data points. The ﬁrst

set of data point ends at Pi+1 , while the second set of data point starts at Pi+1 .
If Pi−1 , Pi and Pi+1 are on a straight line, then setting ti − ti−1 = |Pi−1 Pi |,
ti+1 − ti = |Pi Pi+1 |, this determination makes the quadratic polynomial Qi (t)
which passes Pi−1 , Pi and Pi+1 be a straight line with the magnitude of the ﬁrst
derivative being a constant. Such a straight line is the most well deﬁned curve
one can get in this case.

Experiments

The new method has been compared with the chord length, centripetal, Foley
and ZCM’s methods. The comparison is performed by using the knots computed
using these methods in the construction of a parametric cubic spline interpolant.
For brevity, the cubic splines produced using these methods are called chord
spline, centripetal spline, Foley’s spline, ZCM spline and new spline, respectively.
The data points used in the comparison are taken from the following ellipse
x = x(τ ) = 3 cos(2πτ )
y = y(τ ) = 2 sin(2πτ )

(22)

The comparison is performed by dividing the interval [0, 1] into 36 sub-intervals
to deﬁne data points, i.e., τi is deﬁned by
τi = (i + σ sin((36 − i) ∗ i))/36

i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , 36

where 0 ≤ σ ≤ 0.25.
To avoid the maximum error occurred near the end points (x0 , y0 ) and (x20 ,
y20 ), the tangent vectors of F (τ ) at τ = 0 and τ = 1 are used as the end
conditions to construct the cubic splines.
The ﬁve methods are compared by the absolute error curve E(t), deﬁned by
E(t) = min{|P (t) − F (τ )|}
= min{|Pi (t) − F (τ )|, τi ≤ τ ≤ τi+1 }

i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , 19

where P (t) denotes one of the chord spline, centripetal spline, Foley’s spline,
ZCM’s spline or new spline, Pi (t) is the corresponding part of P (t) on the subinterval [ti , ti+1 ], and F (τ ) is deﬁned by (22). For the point P (t), E(t) is the
shortest distance from curve F (τ ) to P (t) .

are shown in table 1. The ﬁve methods have also been compared on data points
which divide [0, 1] into 18, 72, ... etc subintervals. The results are basically similar
as those shown in tables 1.

Conclusions and Future Works

A new method for determining knots in parametric curve interpolation is presented. The determined knots have a quadratic polynomial precision. This means
that from the approximation point of view, the new method is better than the
chord length, centripetal and Foley’s methods in terms of error evaluation in the
associated Taylor series. The ZCM’s method has also a quadratic polynomial
precision, but it is a global method, while the new method is a local one.
The new method works well on the data points whose convexity does not
change sign, our next work is to extend it to work on the data points whose
convexity changes sign.
