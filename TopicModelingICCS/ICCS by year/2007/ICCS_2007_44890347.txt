Abstract. The vertex set of a digraph D is denoted by V (D). A cpartite tournament is an orientation of a complete c-partite graph. Let
V1 , V2 , . . . , Vc be the partite sets of D. If there exist two vertex disjoint cycles C and C in D such that Vi ∩ (V (C) ∪ V (C )) = ∅ for
all i = 1, 2, . . . , c, then D is cycle componentwise complementary. The
global irregularity of D is deﬁned by ig (D) = max{max(d+ (x), d− (x)) −
min(d+ (y), d− (y))|x, y ∈ V (D)} over all vertices x and y of D (x = y
is admissible), where d+ (x) and d− (x) are the outdegree and indegree
of x, respectively. If ig (D) ≤ 1, then D is almost regular. In this paper,
we consider a special kind of multipartite tournaments which are almost
regular 3-partite tournaments, and we show that each almost regular 3partite tournament D is cycle componentwise complementary, unless D
is isomorphic to D3,2 .
Keywords: almost regular, componentwise complementary cycles, tournament.

Terminology and Preliminary Results

We shall assume that the reader is familiar with the standard terminology on
directed graphs and refer the reader to [1]. In this paper all digraphs are ﬁnite
without loops or multiple arcs. The vertex set and the arc set of a digraph D
are denoted by V (D) and E(D), respectively. For a vertex set X of D, we deﬁne
D[X] as the subdigraph induced by X. If xy is an arc of a digraph D, then we
write x → y and say x dominates y.
A c-partite or multipartite tournament is an orientation of a complete cpartite graph. A tournament is a c-partite tournament with exactly c vertices.
A semicomplete multipartite digraph is obtained by replacing each edge of a
complete multipartite graph by an arc or by a pair of two mutually opposite arcs
with the same end vertices. Let V1 , V2 , . . . , Vc be the partite sets of a c-partite
tournament or semicomplete c-partite digraph D and |V1 | ≤ |V2 | ≤ . . . ≤ |Vc |. If

the vertex x of D belongs to the partite set Vi , then we deﬁne V (x) = Vi and
deﬁne γ(D) = V1 .
If X and Y are two disjoint subsets of V (D) or subdigraphs of D such that
every vertex of X dominates every vertex of Y , then we say that X dominates
Y , denoted by X → Y . If there is no arc from Y to X, but x → y for all x ∈ X
and y ∈ Y which are in diﬀerent partite sets, then we denote this by X ⇒ Y
which denotes the property that there is no arc from Y to X.
The out-neighborhood ND+ (x) = N + (x) of a vertex x is the set of vertices
dominated by x, and the in-neighborhood ND− (x) = N − (x) is the set of ver−
+
+
tices dominating x. The number d+
D (x) = d (x) = |N (x)| and dD (x) =
−
−
d (x) = |N (x)| are the outdegree and indegree of x, respectively. The minimum outdegree and the minimum indegree of D are denoted by δ + (D) = δ +
and δ − (D) = δ − , and δ(D) = δ = min{δ + , δ − }. The irregularity I(D) of a
digraph is max |d+ (x) − d− (y)| over all vertices x and y of D (x = y is admissible). In addition, the local irregularity is deﬁned by i (D) = max |d+ (x) − d− (x)|
over all vertices x of D and the global irregularity of a digraph D is deﬁned
by ig (D) = max{max(d+ (x), d− (x)) − min(d+ (y), d− (y))|x, y ∈ V (D)} over all
vertices x and y of D (x = y is admissible). Clearly, i (D) ≤ I(D) ≤ ig (D). If
ig (D) = 0, then D is regular and if ig (D) ≤ 1, then D is almost regular.
A cycle of length m is an m-cycle. A cycle or a path in a digraph D is
Hamiltonian if it includes all the vertices of D. A set X ⊆ V (D) of vertices
is independent if the induced subdigraph D[X] has no arcs. The independence
number α(D) = α is the maximum size among the independent sets of vertices
of D.
A digraph D is strongly connected or strong if, for each pair of vertices u and
v, there is a path from u to v in D. A digraph D with at least k + 1 vertices
is k-connected if for any set A of at most k − 1 vertices, the subdigraph D − A
obtained by deleting A is strong. The connectivity of D, denoted by k(D), is
then deﬁned to be the largest value of k such that D is k-connected. A set S of
vertices of a digraph D is a separating set if D − S is not strong.
If we replace every arc xy of D by yx, then we call the resulting digraph,
denoted by D−1 , the converse digraph of D.
A digraph D is cycle complementary if there exist two vertex-disjoint cycles
C and C such that V (D) = V (C) ∪ V (C ).
The following results play important roles in the proof of our main result.
Lemma 1 ([2]). Let D be a c-partite tournament with the partite sets V1 , V2 ,
. . . , Vc . Then ||Vi | − |Vj || ≤ 2I(D) ≤ 2ig (D) for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ c.
Theorem 1 ([3]). If D is a multipartite tournament, then
k(D) ≥

|V (D)| − 2i (D) − α(D)
.

Theorem 2 ([14]). Let D be a regular 3-partite tournament with |V (D)| ≥ 6.
Then D contains two complementary cycles of length 3 and |V (D)| − 3, unless
D is isomorphic to D3,2 . (D3,2 is shown in Fig. 1.)

Main Result

The problem of complementary cycles in tournaments was almost completely
solved by Reid [5] in 1985 and by Song [6] in 1993. These authors proved that
every 2-connected tournament D on at least 8 vertices has complementary cycles
of length t and |V (D)| − t for all t ∈ {3, 4, . . . , |V (D)| − 3}. Later, Guo and Volkmann [7], [8] extended this result to locally semicomplete digraphs. In addition,
there are some results on complementary cycles on bipartite tournaments by Z.
Song, K. Zhang, J. Wang and Manoussakis. See [9], [11], [10], [12].
Volkmann [13] conﬁrmed that each regular multipartite tournament is cycle
∗
, D3,2 . But the problem
complementary, unless D is isomorphic to T7 , D4,2 , D4,2
about the existences of complementary cycles in multipartite digraphs which
are not tournaments or bipartite tournaments or locally semicomplete digraphs
or regular digraphs is still open. It seems that the problem of complementary
cycles in semicomplete n-partite digraphs with n ≥ 3 is diﬃcult. In the following,
we give the deﬁnition of componentwise complementary cycles in multipartite
digraphs.

Deﬁnition 1. (componentwise complementary cycles) Let V1 , V2 , . . . , Vc be the
partite sets of D. If there exist two vertex disjoint cycles C and C in D such
that Vi ∩ (V (C) ∪ V (C )) = ∅ for all i = 1, 2, . . . , c, then C and C are two
componentwise complementary cycles of D.
Clearly, a pair of componentwise complementary cycles of D is a pair of complementary cycles of D, if it contains all vertices of D.
If D contains a pair of componentwise complementary cycles, then D is cycle
componentwise complementary.
Our main result is the following theorem.
Theorem 4. If D is an almost regular 3-partite tournament with |V (D)| ≥ 6,
then D is cycle componentwise complementary, unless D is isomorphic to D3,2 .
Example 1. Let V1 = {x1 , x2 }, V2 = {y1 , y2 }, V3 = {u1 , u2 } be the partite sets of
the 2-regular 3-partite tournament D3,2 presented in Fig. 1. Then it is a simple
matter to verify that D3,2 contains no componentwise complementary 3-cycles
(and of course no complementary cycles).

Proof of Theorem 4

Let V1 , V2 , V3 be the partite sets of D such that |V1 | ≤ |V2 | ≤ |V3 |. By Theorem 1
and i (D) ≤ ig (D),
k(D) ≥

|V (D)| − 2ig (D) − α(D)
|V (D)| − 2i (D) − α(D)
≥
. (1)

If |V1 | = r, then because of ig (D) ≤ 1 we deduce from Lemma 1 that |V3 | =
r + l for some l ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Since |V (D)| ≥ 6, r ≥ 2.
Clearly, if l = 0, then D is a regular 3-partite tournament. By Theorem 2,
D contains a pair of complementary cycles, i.e. D contains a pair of componentwise complementary cycles, unless D is isomorphic to D3,2 . In the following,
we consider the case l = 0. According to (1), we have k(D) ≥ 1. In view of
Theorem 3, there exists a 3-cycle C3 in D. If we deﬁne the 3-partite tournament
H by H = D − V (C3 ), then i (H) ≤ ig (H) ≤ 3. We distinguish ﬁve cases.

|V1 | = r,
|V1 | = r,
|V1 | = r,
|V1 | = r,
|V1 | = r,

|V2 | = r,
|V3 | = r + 1.
|V2 | = r + 1, |V3 | = r + 1.
|V2 | = r,
|V3 | = r + 2.
|V2 | = r + 1, |V3 | = r + 2.
|V2 | = r + 2, |V3 | = r + 2.

According to Proposition 1, we have case 4 is impossible.
Since the proofs of the cases above are similar, we give the proof of case 1
only.
Let V1 = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xr }, V2 = {y1 , y2 , . . . , yr }, V3 = {u1 , u2 , . . . , ur+1 }, and

x ∈ V (D). If H contains a cycle C, then we have V (C3 ) ∩ V (C) = ∅ and
(V (C3 ) ∪ V (C)) ∩ Vi = ∅ for all i = 1, 2, 3. Otherwise, let P = v1 v2 . . . vp be a
longest path of H. Clearly, v1 ⇒ V (D − V (C3 )) and V (D − V (C3 )) ⇒ vp . Hence,
we have
d+
D (v1 ) ≥ 3r + 1 − 3 − r = 2r − 2, and
d−
D (v1 ) ≤ 2.
If r ≥ 4, then d+
D (v1 ) ≥ 2r − 2 > r + 1. The contradiction to the almost regular
of D.

−
If r = 3, then d+
D (v1 ) ≥ 2r − 2. Since dD (v1 ) ≤ 2, we have dD (v1 ) − dD (v1 ) ≥
2r − 4 = 2, a contradiction to ig (D) ≤ 1.
If r = 2, then |V1 | = 2, |V2 | = 2, and |V3 | = 3. If p < 3, i.e. p = 2, then there is
one vertex u such that it is adjacent with y for all y ∈ V (P ). Since P is a longest
path in H, v1 → u and u → v2 . Then H has a path x1 ux2 , a contradiction.
Therefore, p = 3 or p = 4. If there exists Vi such that Vi ∩ V (P ) = ∅ for some
i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, then there is a vertex z ∈ Vi such that it is adjacent with y for
all y ∈ V (P ). Since P is a longest path in H, v1 → z and z → vp . Then there
is an integer j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p} such that vj−1 → z → vj . Therefore, H has a
(p + 1)-path , a contradiction. We consider two cases.
(1) Let p = 3. Then P = v1 v2 v3 .
If v2 ∈ V3 , then there is one vertex x ∈ V3 such that v1 → x → v3 . Let,
without loss of generality, v1 ∈ V1 and v3 ∈ V2 . Since ig (D) ≤ 1, {y1 , u1 } → v1 ,
v3 → {x1 , u1 }. If y1 → v2 , then v2 → x1 and we obtain the componentwise
complementary cycles x1 y1 v2 x1 and u1 v1 xv3 u1 . If v2 → y1 , then x1 → v2 . Furthermore, if x1 → x, then we have the componentwise complementary cycles
x1 xv3 u1 x1 and y1 v1 v2 y1 ; if x → x1 , then y1 → x and we obtain the componentwise complementary cycles x1 y1 xx1 and u1 v1 v2 v3 u1 .
Let v3 ∈ V3 . If v1 ∈ V3 , then we consider D−1 . Let, without loss of generality,
v1 ∈ V1 and v2 ∈ V2 . Since P is a longest path in H, |V1 | = 2, |V2 | = 2, and
|V3 | = 3, there is one vertex x ∈ V3 such that {v1 , v2 } → x. Since ig (D) ≤ 1,
{v3 , x} → {x1 , y1 }, {y1 , u1 } → v1 , and x1 → v2 . If v2 → u1 , then we have the
componentwise complementary cycles x1 v2 u1 x1 and y1 v1 v3 y1 . If u1 → v2 , then
we have the componentwise complementary cycles x1 v2 xx1 and y1 u1 v1 v3 y1 .
(2) Let p = 4. Then P = v1 v2 v3 v4 .
Note that |V1 | = 2, |V2 | = 2, and |V3 | = 3.
First we assume that V (v1 ) = V (v4 ), i.e. V (v1 ) = V (v4 ) = V3 . Let, without
loss of generality, v2 ∈ V1 and v3 ∈ V2 . Since ig (D) ≤ 1, {x1 , y1 } → v1 and
v4 → {x1 , y1 }.
If v3 → x1 and u1 → v2 , then we obtain the componentwise complementary
cycles x1 v1 v3 x1 and y1 u1 v2 v4 y1 .
If v3 → x1 and v2 → u1 , then we have y1 → v2 and u1 → v3 . This leads to
the componentwise complementary cycles y1 v2 v4 y1 and x1 v1 v3 x1 .
If x1 → v3 , then we have v3 → u1 and u1 → v2 . Furthermore, if v2 → y1 , then
we obtain the componentwise complementary cycles y1 u1 v2 y1 and x1 v1 v3 v4 x1 ;

if y1 → v2 , then we obtain the componentwise complementary cycles y1 v2 v4 y1
and x1 v1 v3 u1 x1 .
Now we assume that V (v1 ) = V (v4 ). Let, without loss of generality, {v2 , v4 } ⊂
V3 . If {v1 , v3 } ⊂ V3 , then we consider D−1 . Let, without loss of generality, v1 ∈ V1
and v3 ∈ V2 . Since ig (D) ≤ 1, {y1 , u1 } → v1 and v4 → {x1 , y1 }.
If y1 → v2 , then we have v2 → x1 , x1 → v3 , and v3 → u1 . This leads to
x1 v3 u1 x1 and the componentwise complementary cycle y1 v1 v4 y1 .
If v2 → y1 , then x1 → v2 . Furthermore, if v3 → u1 , then we obtain the
componentwise complementary cycles u1 x1 v2 v3 u1 and y1 v1 v4 y1 ; if u1 → v3 , then
v3 → x1 and the componentwise complementary cycles x1 v2 v3 x1 and y1 u1 v1 v4 y1 .
The proof is complete.
