Abstract. The IEEE 802.11 standard basically uses a DCF (Distributed
Coordination Function) to access a wireless channel. However, the DCF
uses wireless resource ineﬀectively when there are many contending stations and a high bit error rate. To enhance the performance of the wireless
LAN, Ki et al. proposed a Binary Negative-Exponential Backoﬀ (BNEB)
algorithm. We found that the performance of the BNEB algorithm was
better than the conventional DCF. However, erroneous channel environment was not considered. In our work, we propose an analytical model
for the BNEB algorithm in the presence of transmission error and compare the performance of the DCF with the BEB algorithm to that with
the BNEB algorithm. From the result, the BNEB algorithm yields better
performance than the DCF when the bit error rate (BER) ≤ 10−5 .
Keywords: DCF, BNEB, BER, Contention Window.

Introduction

The IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) employs the distributed coordination function (DCF) [1]. The DCF is a contention-based channel access function adopting a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) for frame transmission during the contention period. However, in
the DCF, the more the number of stations uses the wireless resources, the more
collision occurrences are possible. To solve these problems, much research on the
performance of the IEEE 802.11 DCF has been conducted.
Bianchi presented an analytical model and showed that the proposed model
was very accurate [2][3]. The performance of the DCF in the presence of transmission error was evaluated in [4][5]. For eﬀective management of wireless resources,

Performance Evaluation of Binary Negative-Exponential Backoﬀ Algorithm

Ki et al. proposed a Binary Negative-Exponential Backoﬀ (BNEB) algorithm [6].
The BNEB algorithm increases the contention window to the maximum window
size when stations experience a collision and decreases the contention window
size by half when a transmission is successful. In [6], the results showed that the
BNEB had better performance than the DCF with the BEB algorithm in ideal
channel conditions. However, the performance of the BNEB algorithm may depend on the presence of transmission error. Thus, we propose an analytical model
for the BNEB algorithm and evaluate the performance of the BNEB algorithm
in presence of transmission error.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes an analytical
model of the BNEB algorithm in the presence of transmission error under the
saturation condition. In Section 3, we describe our veriﬁcation of our analytical
model by simulations and compare the throughput of the DCF with the BNEB
algorithm to that with BEB algorithm. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.

Analytical Model for BNEB

Our analysis assumes that there are n stations having frame(s) to transmit and
each station has frame(s) after successful transmission. In addition, it is possible that a station fails to transmit a frame because of channel noise. For
a station, s(t) and b(t) are deﬁned as the random process representing the
backoﬀ stage and the backoﬀ counter at time t. The BNEB algorithm can be
modeled as a bi-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (s(t), b(t)). Let bi,j =
limt→∞ P {s(t) = i, b(t) = j} and p be the transmission failure probability that
a station experiences a collision or transmission error in a slot. Then, the state
transition probabilities and state relations are given in [6]. And p is given by:
p = 1 − (1 − τ )n−1 (1 − BER)l+H ,

where the BER, l and H represent the channel bit error rate, packet payload
size and the packet header size.
From [6] and p, we can obtain b0,0 :

Performance Evaluations

To evaluate the performance of the DCF with the BEB and BNEB algorithms
in the presence of a transmission error, we used the table in [6] for the MAC
parameters. The normalized saturation throughput of the DCF with the BEB
and BNEB algorithms is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1(a) illustrates that the
analytical results of the BNEB algorithm are close to the simulation results
and depicts the throughput diﬀerence between the DCF with the BEB and
BNEB algorithms as the BER increases. In the result, the number of contending
stations does not aﬀect the saturation throughput of the BNEB algorithm in
contrast with the DCF with the BEB algorithm when BER ≤ 10−5 . When
BER > 10−5 , the possibility of transmission failure by a transmission error is
larger than that of transmission failure by a collision. Therefore, the diﬀerence of
the DCF with the BEB and BNEB algorithms is decreased and the throughput
of both algorithms reaches to 0 as BER increases.
Figure 1(b) shows the saturation throughput of the DCF with the BEB and
BNEB algorithms as the number of contending stations increases when the BER
is ﬁxed at 10−4 , 10−5 and 10−6 . When there are many contending stations,
because the collision is more frequent than the transmission error, the BNEB
algorithm shows better performance than the DCF. However, the backoﬀ time
strongly aﬀects the saturation throughput of two algorithms when there are less
contending stations. In the small number of contending stations and high BER,
since the backoﬀ time of the BNEB algorithm is larger than that of the DCF with
the BEB algorithm, the performance of the BNEB algorithm is less than that
of the DCF with the BEB algorithm. However, because most wireless devices
operate where BER ≤ 10−5 [7], in most cases, the performance of the BNEB
algorithm is better than that of the DCF with the BEB algorithm.

Conclusion

In this paper, we described our evaluation of the performance of a Binary
Negative-Exponential Backoﬀ (BNEB) algorithm in the presence of transmission error by means of an analytical model and simulations of the saturation
condition. With low BER, the performance of the BNEB algorithm was better
than the DCF with the BEB algorithm because of eﬀective collision resolution.
Because of ineﬀective management of backoﬀ time, the throughput of the BNEB
algorithm was smaller than DCF with BEB algorithm with high BER. However,
we can expect that the BNEB algorithm will show better performance than DCF
because most wireless devices operate when BER ≤ 10−5 .
