Abstract. For the two types of shield tunneling such as Slurry and EPB shield
the stability of tunnel face depends on the prevailing support pressure. The
support pressure at the tunnel face has to be applied to a value that gives as well
sufficient safety against a collapse of the tunnel face as the against uplifting.
The paper aims at a better understanding of the mechanics of face failure for
those lager-diameter tunnels. And some different determination methods of the
applied support pressure are compared and given a risk assessment, which are
illustrated their application by numerical analysis in the Yangtze River Tunnel
of Shanghai.
Keywords: face stability, risk assessment, numerical analysis, large-diameter
tunnel.

1 Introduction
With underground excavations and construction works progress into much larger
diameter tunnels and more complex geological environments, Slurry shield and EPB
tunneling have been successfully applied worldwide in recent years, which allow the
control the surface settlement and limit the risk of tunnel face failure through the
continuous support the face. However, face instabilities may occur under extremely
unfavorable geological conditions, especially some lager-diameter tunnels like the
Yangtze River Tunnel of Shanghai whose outside diameter is about 15.0m.
As is known, Peck [1] introduced the one of main issues to be addresses for the
design and construction of tunnels: stability of the opening during construction with
particular attention to the tunnel face stability. The stability of tunnel face is of
paramount importance for construction the lager-diameter tunnel works. Several
approaches have been developed to analyze and calculate the support pressure of
tunnel face over the past thirty years. Early works on face stability were concerned
with tunnels constructed in clays (Broms and Bennermark [2]; Peck [1]). Then a more
theoretical approach based on limit analysis was presented for clays by Davis et al [3].
Within the framework of limit analysis, some lower bound solutions were presented
to analyze tunneling in sandy ground by Muelhaus [4], Leca and Panet [5] and Leca
and Dormieux [6]. And the approaches were checked against model tests performed
with Fontainebleau sand in the centrifuge of the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et
Chaussées (LCPC) in Nantes, France (Chambon and Corté [7,8] ). Another approach,

taking full account of the 3-dimensional geometry at the tunnel face, was proposed by
Anagnostou and Kovári [9, 10, 11], using limit equilibrium principles based on the
Horn [12] (see figure 1) model. Recent developments allowed the computational
methods of tunnel face support pressure were proposed and performed by many
researchers, Chen Z.L. [13], W. Broere [14], Vermeer P.A.& Ruse N. [15].
There are so many methods for calculating the support pressure of tunnel face, and
it is not easily to select the best one for design and construction large-diameter tunnel.
The paper aims at a better understanding of the mechanics of face failure for those
large-diameter tunnels by 3-Dimensional numerical simulation. And some different
determination methods of the applied support pressure are compared here and given a
risk assessment, which are illustrated their application by numerical analysis in the
Yangtze River Tunnel of Shanghai.

2 Different Computational Methods on Support Pressure of
Tunnel Face
In order to analyze the mechanics of face failure for those large-diameter tunnels by
3-D numerical simulation, 6 different computational methods were introduced as
follows.
(1) The computational model of passive earth pressure [16]
(2) The computational model of earth pressure at rest [16]
(3) The computational model of active earth pressure [16]
(4) The computational model of Chen Z.L. [13]

Where u is the pore water pressure, and ϕ ′ is soil effective friction angle.

Where c′ and ϕ ′ are soil effective cohesion and soil effective friction angle
respectively, γ is the unit soil weight at the depth of tunnel axis, and D is tunnel
diameter.
(6) The computational method of the minimal support pressure based on the
Multilayered Wedge model
To construct a wedge stability model, as sketched in Fig.1, which could handle
heterogeneous soil conditions by Anagnostou and Kovári [9, 10, 11], the horizontal slice
model described by Walz [17] for slurry-filled trenches might serve as a starting point.
The failure wedge is subdivided in N smaller bodies by W. Broere [14], see Fig. 2,
possibly of different thickness, inside each of which the soil conditions are
homogeneous. The soil conditions would vary between these slices, as may the wedge
angle θi between the i th slice’s slanted failure plane and the horizontal. The
conditions of horizontal and vertical equilibrium could lead to calculate the minimal
support pressure as follows.

3 Numerical Analysis Model and Risk Assessment
3.1 The Model of Numerical Analysis
According to all above computational methods of support pressure of tunnel face,
some different support pressure of tunnel face may be calculated. When largediameter tunnels were designed and constructed, the factual support pressure at the
tunnel face had to be applied to a value that gives as well sufficient safety against a
collapse of the tunnel face as the against uplifting. So the appropriate support pressure
should be selected through analyzing the mechanics of face failure for large-diameter
tunnel. In order to analyze the mechanics of tunnel face failure through numerical
simulation, there were some problems which needed to be considered in advance.
(1) The method of numerical analysis. There are so many softwares such as
ANSYS, ABAQUS, Plaxis and FLAC3D etc., which could be used to simulate and
analyze the process of tunneling. Because the method of numerical analysis aimed at
a better understanding and simulating of the mechanics of face failure for those lagerdiameter tunnels, the selected software should calculate the 3-D tunnel built of soil
that undergo large deformation, plastic flow and face collapse. As is known, FLAC3D
offers an ideal analysis tool for solution of 3-D problems in geotechnical engineering.
And it could accord with the requirement of numerical analysis for engineering
mechanics computation of tunnel face instability.
(2) The criterion to judge the face failure of tunnel. The key problem is to establish
a criterion for judging the plastic or collapse condition of tunnel face. There are two
criteria [18], one is to set the non-convergence of force and displacement of tunnel
face as a judgment of numerical analysis; and the other is to set the plastic flow or the
yield stress state as determining the face failure condition. After considered that the
distribution of plastic zone was influenced by many factors such as Poisson's ratio,
flow rule, etc, non-convergence of displacement in numerical analysis program could
be taken as a suitable evaluating criterion for estimating the tunnel face failure.
(3) How to apply the support pressure to tunnel face. When tunnel face was
excavating by slurry shield or EPB, the force distribution of in-suit tunnel face was
trapeziform from the top to bottom of tunnel. So how to apply the support pressure to
balance the in-suit earth pressure is a big problem. There are two application modes,
one is to apply the support pressure to balance the earth pressure of tunnel face at the
center of tunnel axis, and the other is to apply the support pressure to balance the
earth pressure of tunnel face at the point of composition forces of tunnel face.
Because the numerical simulation was to analyze the face stability of large-diameter
tunnel, the latter mode was selected as a application mode of support pressure.
3.2 Risk Assessment
During the excavation of tunnel face, the distribution of earth pressure would change
with tunneling. The face stability was a dynamic condition (see Fig.3). That is, the
face stability would be undergone from a stable state to limit equilibrium and to
instability even face collapse. So the risk about face stability of large-diameter tunnel

could be assessed through the criterion for judging the face failure with the ratio of
support pressure to vertical earth pressure at the centre of tunnel face.

λ = p /σv

p is the support pressure at tunnel face, and σ v is the vertical earth pressure

3.3 Case Study
Yangtze River tunnel is the south crossing way from Pudong to Changxing Island in
Shanghai. This tunnel has about a 7.5km in length and 15m in outside diameter. In
order to illustrate the method of numerical analysis and risk assessment, the tunnel
alignment pile K0+589 was studied [16]. Based on the geology investigation data and
tunnel structure design, the computational parameters of soil and tunnel at No
K0+589 are shown in Table 1.

The different support pressures of large-diameter tunnel face were calculated by all
above methods. And the deformation of the large-diameter tunnel could be studied by
the different support pressure using the software Flac3D. And the risk assessment [19]
could be given by the ratio of support pressure to vertical earth pressure at the centre
of tunnel face shown as Table 2.

Q. Hu and H. Huang

As the support pressure of tunnel face was decreased from pp to p0, the +z
direction displacement along tunnel alignment was also decreased, otherwise, the -z
direction displacement along tunnel alignment was increased (See Fig.4 (a)). When
the support pressure was decreased from p0 to pmin, the +z direction displacement
along tunnel alignment was still reduced to 0m, simultaneity, the -z direction
displacement along tunnel alignment was increased the maximum, that is face
collapse or instability when support pressure was null. The relation of displacement
velocity and support pressure of tunnel face was shown in Fig.4 (b).
When the large-diameter was excavated by shield machine, the safety support
pressure could be estimated by the displacement velocity of tunnel face to which was
applied different support pressure. And the safe zone of support pressure of pile
No.K0+589 was shown in Fig.5 (a) and Fig.5 (b).

4 Conclusions
(1) There were so many method which could be used to calculate the support pressure
of large-diameter, and the actual support pressure was a value that gave as well
sufficient safety against a collapse of the tunnel face as the against uplifting. So it is
essential that the mechanics of face stability should be studied before the design and
construction. And the method of numerical analysis and risk assessment could
provide a new approach to determinate the safe support pressure.
(2) The face stability of tunnel was a dynamic process when the support pressure
was changed during shield tunneling. The numerical analysis could give an elaborate
simulation of the displacement process while the support pressure was decreased
gradually. Compared the displacement and displacement velocity of different support
pressure, the risk of tunnel face stability may be assessed simultaneity. And the risk
management of tunnel construction should also be paid much attention to consider
and adopt when the large-diameter tunnel was excavating.
