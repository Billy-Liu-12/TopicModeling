Abstract. Multicast based audio/video collaboration is one of representative
applications in next generation internet. IP multicast has the advantage of saving bandwidth for group communication on large scale collaboration. The lack
of ubiquitous multicast supporting and lack of effective service for multicast
based A/V collaboration limit its application. This paper introduces the service
and management of multicast based audio/video collaboration on China education and research network (CERNET). The multicast service, user and session
management, performance monitoring and flow control are presented. The collaboration system has been applied on CERNET successfully.
Keywords: service, audio/video collaboration, multicast.

1 Introduction
Multi-party audio/video (A/V) collaboration systems are important applications in
Next Generation Internet [1].In multi-party A/V collaboration, users could receive all
group users’ A/V stream with strong interactive characters. Among the solutions multicast based system may be ideal way for group collaboration. IP multicast could save
bandwidth for many-to-many media communication, which makes it scalable. Some
multicast based A/V systems as AccessGrid[2] have been employed recently. But for
some reality reasons, the native multicast is not available ubiquitously, which confines
the multicast applications extensively. On the other hand, the current A/V collaboration
system lacks effective service and management, for example, lack of guarantee on
quality of service. In this paper, we introduce the service and management for multicast based A/V collaboration on CERNET. The IP multicast service on CERNET, user
and session management, performance monitor and flow control are presented. We
have implemented and applied the multicast A/V collaboration successfully.

2 The Multicast Service on CERNET
The native multicast is deployed at network level routers with multicast protocols.
Now we have configured native multicast on CERNET backbone covering all the
provincial capitals. The multicast routing protocol deployed on CERNET backbone is
PIM-SM (Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode) [3]. The PIM-DM [4] is

deployed in regional networks, and MSDP [5] are used for routing between different
AS domains. In practice on deploying PIM-SM, we adopted 10 anycast
RP(Rendezvous Point)s with same IP address via MSDP[5].
To users not in multicast domain we supply reflectors for them to join multicast
group. Reflectors are application layer gateway which could convert unicast streaming
data into multicast data and convert the multicast data into unicast data conversely.
Figure 1 shows the communication mechanism of reflector. The unicast users send
their A/V streaming to reflector, reflector receive the unicast data and retransmit them
to multicast group. On the other hand, the multicast A/V data from multicast users are
received by reflector and resent to unicast users. By this way, users could receive all
group users’ A/V streaming whether the users are in unicast or multicast domain.

3 User Management and Session Service
We establish one website http://mvc.edu.cn[6] at CERNET national network center as
collaboration service center for multicast A/V collaboration (CSC-MVC).
3.1 Users Manage and Venue Generation
Users in A/V collaboration could be classified into two types: chairman and participates. Chairman is the sponsor of collaboration venue. Commonly chairman applies
for new venue and manages the venue. When chairman applies for create new venue,
the Administrator of CSC-MVC would generate one new venue and add it to venuelist. The administrator assigned the session information for the venue.
Some authorities on venue manage may be endowed to the chairman by CSCMVC administrator .The chairman manages the participant users of this venue. If one
user want to attend one venue, he must apply to the chairman or be invited by the
chairman. In our service, the sponsor adds the invited users’ name to the participants
list, only the users in the invited participants list are permitted to enter the sponsor’s
venue room, otherwise he would be denied.
3.2 Session Service
Session information is created by CSC-MVC administrator. The session information
mainly consists of IP/port pairs for audio/video. To users in native multicast domain,

the multicast IP addresses are supplied, to users in unicast domain, the unicast IP
addresses of reflectors are supplied.
The user first accesses the CSC-MVC website and login, authorized user could access venue room list (as figure 4 shows) and enter the prefer venue room if the user has
been invited by chairman of this venue room. The session information stored in the
venue is sent to end users when users enter venue. By parsing session information, the
end user would get the multicast (and unicast) IP addresses/ports to launch their audio/video tools. Secret key and other session information are also used for launching
audio/video. When at least two users enter the venue and communicate each other via
audio/video tools, the multicast session is established. The session is terminated when
all the users leave from the venues room. To temporary venue room, the CSC-MVC
would delete the venue and take back the multicast IP /port pairs.

4 Performance Monitor and Flow Control
To guarantee the quality of multicast based A/V collaboration, we design and implement the performance monitor and flow control scheme. We build a server for performance monitor and flow control charged by chairman. As Figure 2 shows, during
collaboration the endpoints send their performance messages to server. The messages
include the user’s sending traffic, end-to-end delay and packet loss rate.

The end-to-end delay and PLR are calculated through RTP/RTCP protocols in audio/video tools. For example, PLR are calculated by received RTP packets. In a group
with N users, each user can get N-1 PLR from other senders, figure 3 shows one
user’s end-to-end PLR report message. When all N users send their PLR message to
the performance server, the server could get N*(N-1) end-to-end PLRs. Chairman
monitors the application performance from server. When congestion occurs, chairman
would send rate control message to endpoints to adjust their sending bit rate. By this
simple manual control, serious congestion could be avoided.

5 Service and Application on CERNET
The multicast based audio/video collaboration service has been provided on CERNET
since 2002.In 2003 SARS period, the system advanced the A/V collaborations among
domestic universities. Now the service has expanded to all provinces of China and
become the A/V communication platform for CERNET members. Figure 4 shows one
venue room list on collaboration service center for multicast A/V collaboration.

6 Conclusions
This paper introduces the service of multicast based audio/video collaboration systems on CERNET. The multicast service, users manage and session service, performance monitor and control are presented. The multicast based audio/video collaboration
has been applied on CERNET successfully in nationwide.
