Abstract. This paper develops a comprehensive but simple methodology to
valuate information technology investment in a nuclear power station based on
fuzzy risk analysis and real option approach. By linking the variability of
expected payoffs to specific sources of risk factors, this method could help
decision makers achieve a more reliable valuation of the target investment
under multiple sources of risk, and avoid complex estimation tasks at the same
time. The proposed approach can be easily adopted to value any irreversible
investment subject to a high degree of uncertainty that is common in the field of
energy economics.
Keywords: information technology investment, real options analysis, risk
assessment, nuclear industry.

1 Introduction
Real options analysis (ROA) has been accepted as a modern approach for risk
investment analysis. In recent years, this approach has been rapidly evolving, and is
now spreading to the field of energy economics. It is ideally suited for the valuation
of investments in tangible assets and infrastructure like energy generation plants that
are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Similar to energy investment, information
technology (IT) investment is characterized by the nature of Long-time horizons,
significant risks and irreversibility. Researchers propose to introduce ROA to IT
investment decision-making. Benaroch and Kauffman illustrated the use of real
options techniques in the context of a decision to expand a banking ATM network [1].
Taudes suggested that the value of IT investment can be defined as the sum of
economic value and option value [2]. L. milder et al. use ROA to value an IT
infrastructure investment in South Korea [3].
However, several challenging preliminary requirements has prevented the
application of real options theory in practice. For example, Black–Scholes option
pricing model requires the variance per period of rate of return on the asset must be
estimated. In fact, obtaining such a reliable estimation of the variance is usually very
difficult [1]. Furthermore, option pricing model generally assumes that the expected
payoffs are characterized by certain probably distributions, geometric Brownian

motion, for instance. Unfortunately, there does not always exit an efficient market
which could justify the assumption on stochastic phenomena. The use of assumption
on purely stochastic phenomena may lead to improper investment valuation.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive but simple methodology to evaluate IT
investment in a nuclear power station based on real options and fuzzy set theory.
Fuzzy risk analysis is able to well formulate the uncertainty of the expected payoffs
from an investment, moreover simplifies the real option model in certain degree. This
approach will help investors acquire insights about the influence of risk factors on the
expected payoff, and then make better valuation and justification of the target
investment without complex mathematical calculation.

2 A Fuzzy Approach to Real Option Valuation
In this section, we present a new real option approach to value IT investment in
nuclear industry. The investment valuation process consists of five stages. In what
follows, we explain these steps in details.
Step 1: Risk identification
The first step is to identify the potential risk factors associated with IT investment,
and then give a list of the most significant risks. There exist a great variety of risk
factors that threaten the success of IT investment. Recently, Benaroch classified the
IT investment risks identified by IS research stream into three categories, including
firm-specific risks, competition risks and market risks [4].
Step 2: Estimate the risk factors
We assess risk factors largely employing the fuzzy evaluating method present by
Ngai [5]. For simplicity of formulation, we adopt triangular fuzzy numbers to
characterize the membership function of the linguistic terms. The triangular fuzzy
numbers of each linguistic term are set as the same as Ngai does.
Step 3: fuzzy assessment aggregation
Our risk analysis methods allow more than one evaluator to assess the potential
risk factors that affect the expected payoffs of an IT investment. After then, the fuzzy
average operation is used to balance the deferent judgments from all evaluators.
Supposing there are n evaluators and let Ai = (a1( i ) , aM ( i ) , a2( i ) ) be the fuzzy numbers, i
=1,…, n. Then, we can get the triangular average mean:

A average = (m1 , m M , m2 , ) = (

n
1 n (i ) 1 n
(i ) 1
(i )
a
,
a
,
a2 )

∑

M
n i =1
n i =1
n i =1

(1)

After obtaining the fuzzy average of the likelihood and severity of each risk factor,
we start to formulate the overall risk level of the IT investment under consideration.
Fuzzy weighted average (FWA) is a commonly used operation in risk and decision
analysis. To reduce the complexity of comparisons and arithmetic operation, we
utilize an efficient fuzzy weighted average algorithm (EFWA) suggested by Lee and
Park [6].

Step 4: determine expected payoffs and its standard deviation
The result of the calculated fuzzy weighted average is a fuzzy number, which
represents the overall risk faced by IT investment under consideration. Since our
purpose is to valuate the real option value of the investment, it’s required to estimate
the expected payoffs and its standard deviation. We calculate the expected payoffs
using the following formula:

V = V 0 − E (V 0 ) R

(2)

Where V 0 is the initial value of payoffs estimated by decision makers not considering
risk factors, E (V 0 ) denotes the possibilistic mean value of the initial estimation of
payoffs. V is the revised expected payoffs taking into account the probable change
range of payoffs caused by risk factors. V 0
V 01 , V 0 M , V 0 2 , R = ( R1 , R M , R 2 ) and

V = (V1 ,VM ,V2 ) are all fuzzy figures.

＝＝

＝

Supposing A = (a1 , aM , a2 ) be a triangular fuzzy number then the possibilistic
expected value of A is [7]

E( A) = ∫ γ [a1 + γ (aM − a1 ) + a2 − γ (a2 − aM )] d γ =
0

2

aM + (a1 + a2 )

(3)

Using the addition and scalar multiplication rules for arithmetic operations on
triangular fuzzy numbers, we have

＝

V = ( V1 , V M , V 2 ) (V 01 − E (V 0 ) R 2 , V 0 M − E (V 0 ) R M , V 0 2 − E (V 0 ) R 1 )

(4)

[7] also introduced the possibilistic variance of fuzzy number V as
1
(V2 − V1 ) 2
1
2
σ (V) = ∫ γ [(V2 − V1 ) (1 − γ )] dγ =
20

(5)

Step 5: the real option valuation of the investment
In the last step, we can assess the real option value of the investment based on the
result obtained above. For the purpose of simplicity, we assume that only the expected
payoff is uncertain and utilize the Black-Scholes pricing model. Then the fuzzy real
option value of an investment is [8]

FROV = VN (d1 ) − X e −rT N (d 2 )
Where

d1 =

In( E (V ) / X ) + (r + σ 2 / 2)T

σ T

(6)

,

d 2 = d1 − σ T

Only V is fuzzy numbers. E(V) and σ represent respectively the possibilistic
expected value and the standard deviation of fuzzy figure V. The computing result
FROV is also a fuzzy number, representing the real option value of the investment
under consideration.

3 Numerical Examples
The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, completed in 1996, is located on the coast of
the Daya Bay in Guangdong Province, China. In order to maintain efficiency and
competency, Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station utilizes information technology
applications extensively. The company's Corporate Operation Management
Information System (COMIS), has already become an indispensable management
platform for its daily operation activities such as preventive maintenance, inventory
management, procurement planning, et al.
Recently, the power station plan to establish a supplier relationship management
(SRM) system to gain a more reliable supplying source of spares and services it uses.
However, valuation of this investment is a challenging task because of uncertainties
associated with the investment payoff and cost. In this section, we apply the fuzzy
real option valuation approach introduced above to evaluate the SRM investment in
Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station. Our purpose is to illustrate how the real option
value of an investment could be calculated in fuzzy terms.
To valuate the real option value of the investment, it’s required to estimate the
expected payoffs and its standard deviation. Therefore, a series of interviews with
senior managers in the power station are conducted. The expected payoff come from
the SRM investment can be initially estimated as fuzzy triangular figure, which is

The time horizon of the investment is considered to be 3 years, and $400,000 is
needed to develop the system. We use 50% to compute the investment opportunity.
There may be a number of risk factors that affect the expected revenue and the
deviation of revenues, such as incorrect requirements definition, unfavorable attitudes
by users, insufficient experience among team members, or inadequate cooperation of
suppliers. Since our purpose is to provide an illustration on calculating process, we
simply assume the risks associated with the SRM investment could be mapped as
table 1.

The fuzzy averages of each risk factor are showed in table 2. And then, the EFWA
algorithm can be used to calculate the overall risk level of the SRM investment.
Following the computational procedure defined in EFWA algorithm, we can obtain
the resulting membership function of the fuzzy weighted average as R = (0.2222,
0.5769, 0.9167). This triangular fuzzy figure represents the overall risk faced by the
investment.
Consequently, the revised expected payoffs incorporating the overall risk level can
be obtained:

V = V 0 − E (V 0 ) R = ($21085 ,$163810, $312304 )

E (V )） × 163810 + × (21085 + 312304）） $164,771.50

The standard deviation of expected payoffs can be calculated as

σ (V) =

(V2 − V1 ) 2
24

＝

(312304 − 21085) 2

＝59444.79

(9)

i.e. σ (V) = 36%. The last step is to valuate the investment using real option pricing
model. We set the other parameters required by Black-Scholes formula as T = 3, X =
$400,000, r = 7%. Then

FROV = VN ( d1 ) − X e − rT N (d 2 )
Where d1 =

In(164771.5/400000) + 3(0.07 + 0.362 )
0.36 3

(10)

d 2 = -0.77382-0.36 3 = -1.39736

Thus, we can calculated that the fuzzy value of the real option is
FROV = ($21684, $9647, $42244).

4 Concluding Remarks
Real option analysis is a useful tool to formulate the investment decision in uncertain
environment, the energy investment, for instance. However, several minor limitations
of ROA has prevented its application in practice, even could lead to incorrect
valuation. This paper developed a comprehensive but easy-to-use methodology to
solve the complicated evaluation problem of ROA.
The valuation approach we present has incorporated fuzzy risk analysis and real
option valuation. By utilizing risk analysis based on fuzzy set theory, decision makers
could capture the effect of specific risk factors on the expected payoffs, thus obtain a
more reliable estimation about parameters of the real option valuation model. It in
turn provides a basis for a better evaluating and justifying of the target investment,
and avoid complex estimation task at the same time. A numerical example, which
involves an SRM investment in a nuclear power station, is presented to illustrate the
proposed procedures. We are confident that this method is valuable to help managers
produce a well-structured valuation process in information technology investment in
nuclear industry. Besides, the approach can be easily applied in the fields of energy
economic analyses, such as the evaluation of power plants, building transmission
assets, or the adoption of energy efficient technologies.
