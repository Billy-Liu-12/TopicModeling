Abstract. Flood disaster risk analysis, the essential of which is to estimate the
probability distribution of flood disaster loss, is an important nonstructural
measure for flood control and disaster reduction. In the paper, a frequency
analysis method of flood disaster loss based on fuzzy mathematics theory of
information diffusion with short time series of flood disaster samples is
suggested for flood disaster risk analysis. With the support of historic disaster
data, the method has been applied to flood disaster risk analysis for Songhua
River Basin and turned out to be effective and practical.
Keywords: Information Diffusion, Flood Disaster, Risk Analysis, Songhua

1 Introduction
In recent years, flood disaster loss has been sharply increasing with the rapid socialeconomic development. More and more attention has been paid to flood disaster
risk analysis, an important nonstructural measure of flood prevention and disaster
reduction [1, 2]. Predominating flood disaster risk is an important basis for decisions
on flood control and flood insurance. When the historic flood data is sufficient, the
results of risk evaluation can be obtained with considerable satisfaction generally
by probability and statistics. However, in fact, the phenomenon of lack of
experimental flood data occurs frequently, resulting in fewer samples that can only
provide us with finite and incomplete knowledge to understand risk. In this case, it
is inappropriate to take risk analysis by means of probability and statistics with a
small sample, the sample size of which is usually less than 30, as the great fuzziness
and uncertainty of the activity can sometimes lead to very unstable results that may
even depart quite far from the real situation. Actually, one sample in a small sample
set can not be treated as a specific observation due to its fuzziness and uncertainty,
but a representation of the samples or a set-value sample as well as an observation
sample of a fuzzy set. In this paper, fuzzy mathematics theory of information
diffusion is used to establish the flood risk evaluation model with a small number of
experimental samples. The model is then applied to flood risk analysis for Songhua
River Basin in North-East China.

2 Definition of Flood Risk
The definition of Flood Risk is the basis of study on flood risk. The majority of
researchers believe that risk is the occurrence probability of adverse events and the
seriousness of their possible aftereffects. Flood disaster denotes the disaster situation
that forms when the hazard, flood, acts on disaster-affected bodies in certain disasterformative environment. Based on the definition of risk mentioned above, it can be
deduced that adverse event of flood risk is flood, and the aftereffect is flood loss,
namely disaster situation. Therefore, flood risk refers to the occurrence probability of
flood at different intensity and the flood loss possibly caused, which is actually
threefold: (1) flood, measurement of characteristics and magnitude of the flood, such
as the highest water level, the flood peak discharge, the grade of flood volume in
interval and the condition for flood happening, etc; (2) probability, the occurrence
probability of flood event mainly denotes the occurrence frequency and the recurrence
interval of those flood events that exceed certain grade or numerical value; (3) loss,
the loss possibly caused by the occurrence of flood event basically includes flood
disaster economic loss, personnel casualties, environment pollution, social influence,
etc. Flood risk analysis is just to study on the probability distribution of flood loss (or
of disaster situation).

3 Flood Disaster Risk Analysis Based on Information Diffusion
Flood risk analysis utilizing historic disaster data mostly adopts the method of flood
disaster loss frequency analysis. Flood frequency analysis has got widely application
in hydrology, but fewer frequency analyses have been done on flood disaster loss
(disaster situation). Most scholars believe that flood disaster loss (disaster situation)
data fall short of the requirement of frequency analysis for data consistency. Indeed,
with respect to flood disaster economic loss (currency measurement), its gradual
increase with the development of society leads to the non-conformity to the
requirement for data consistency, however, certain disaster indicators like disasteraffected rate of arable land, in certain period, can be considered as a random variable
whose frequency can be analyzed on.
In the statistical risk based on probability and statistics, the uncertainty involved in
risk is relevant to the similitude degree to some standard mode, which can be depicted
by fuzzy sets membership in mathematics theory. Information diffusion is just a fuzzy
mathematic set-value method for samples, considering optimizing the use of fuzzy
information of samples in order to offset the information deficiency. The method can
turn an observed sample into a fuzzy set, that is, turn a single point sample into a setvalue sample [3]. The simplest model of information diffusion is normal diffusion
model.
Suppose X is the natural disaster indicator, and the transcendental frequency
distribution of X in T years can be defined as disaster risk. Concretely, X is given as
economic loss indicator which consists of some specific quantitative values, noted as

Flood Disaster Risk Analysis for Songhua River Basin

1071

X = {x1, x2 ,..., xn} . And suppose the probability for loss transcending X i is pi ( x ≥ xi ) ,
i =1, 2, 3,…,n, then the probability distribution is P = { p1 , p2 ,..., pn } , which can be
named as loss risk caused by disaster, or disaster risk.
If the actual records of the natural disaster indicator in some region during the past
n years are y1 , y2 ,..., yn respectively, then the observed sample set
is Y = {y1, y2 ,..., ym} , in which, y j , (j =1, 2,…,m) is named as disaster sample.
Suppose that the universe discourse of disaster indicator is V = {v1 , v2 ,..., vn } .
Usually, the natural disaster indicator X is taken as the universe discourse V, and each
x in X is taken as corresponding element in the universe discourse V.
A single point observed sample y can diffuse the information it takes to every

( y − vi ) 2 , in which η is the diffusion

coefficient. η = α (b − a ) /(m − 1) can be typically determined by the maximum value
vi according to R (vi ) , R (vi ) =

- b, the minimum value - a, and the number of samples - m, of the sample set, in
which α is the parameter relevant to the sample size as shown in equation (1).

⎧1.6987(b − a ) /(m − 1).............1 < m ≤ 5
⎪
η = ⎨1.43416(b − a ) /(m − 1).........5 ≤ m ≤ 10 .
⎪1.4208(b − a) /(m − 1)................10 ≤ m

Thus, the single point sample y has been turned into the fuzzy set y which takes

μ y (vi ) as its membership function.
During risk evaluation, in order to maintain the status of each set-value sample the
same, every sample y j should be diffused according to equation R (vi ) , that is,
R j (vi ) =

( y j − vi ) 2

exp[ −

4 Flood Disaster Risk Analysis—Taking Songhua River Basin for
Example
Songhua River is the largest branch river of Heilongjiang Basin in China. After the
confluence of the upper reaches-Nen River and the second Songhua River-at
Sanchahe, Fuyu County, Jilin Province, the main stream of Songhua River runs to
meet Heilong River at Tongjiang County. In history, Songhua River had repeatedly
suffered from attacks of flood. During the 240 years from 1746 to 1985, 104 times of
flood disasters had happened in Songhua River Basin altogether, among which 15
were extraordinary ones[ 4].
To analyze the spatial characteristics of flood risk in Songhua River Basin, and
according to the historic disaster data having been collected so far, the paper divides
Songhua River Basin into three sub-basins respectively, that is, Nen River sub-basin,
the main stream of Songhua River sub-basin and the second Songhua River sub-basin.
Afterwards, in terms of the different provinces these sub-basins belong to, Nen River
sub-basin is divided further into Heilonjiang district, Neimenggu district and Jilin
district; the main stream of Songhua River sub-basin is divided further into
Heilongjiang district and Jilin district; and the Second Songhua River sub-basin
mainly lies in Jilin Province.
Disaster-affected rate has been chosen as the disaster indicator in flood risk
analysis. In a certain time period, disaster-affected rate commonly has quite fine
consistency. Disaster-affected rate means the ratio of disaster-affected area to crop
area. In practical calculation, it is so difficult to collect the crop area in every region
year by year that the arable land area is taken as a substitute. Then, calculate the
disaster-affected rate1 of each district in Songhua River Basin for the 25 years from
1965 to 1989 year by year, the result of which is shown in Table 1.

The disaster-affected area data was provided by Songhua River and Liaohe River
Conservancy Commission, and the arable land area data was acquired by measuring from the
electronic 1:4,000,000 land use map.

Suppose that S j ( j = 1, 2 , ...2 5 ) are the disaster-affected area in the period of the 25
years respectively, and S j ' is the crop area of the corresponding year, then the
disaster-affected rate can be expressed as
Ij =

S j ×100%
( j = 1, 2,...25) .
S j'

(7)

Based on equation (7), the disaster-affected rates of the 25 samples can be
calculated out, that is, the observed sample set I = { I 1 , I 2 ,..., I 25 } .In view of both
convenience and accuracy of the computer-aided calculation, the universe discourse
of disaster-affected rate is taken as V = {v1 , v2 ,..., v71} = {0, 0.002, 0.004,..., 0.140} .
The normalized information distribution of each I j , that is, μ I (vi ) , can be obtained
j
according to equation (2) and (3). Then, based on equation (4), (5) and (6), the flood
risk estimation value P(vi ) , that is, disaster-affected risk probability, of each district in
Songhua River Basin can be worked out, as shown in table 2.

Table 2 has shown the general situation of overall risk level for each district that
Heilongjiang district of the main stream of Songhua River and Jilin district of Nen
River are the two districts suffering from the flood disaster risk most, while
Heilongjiang district in Nen River endures the lowest level of risk. According to the
risk evaluation results shown above, it can be summed up that the disaster-affected
rates of each district at different probability levels are as follows in table 3:

It can be learned from table 3 that when a flood disaster encountered once in a
hundred years happens, almost 10.2% arable land in Jilin district of the main stream
of Songhua River, 11.2% around arable land in Heilongjiang district of the main
stream of Songhua River and about 13.0% arable land in Jilin district of Nen River
will be affected; likewise, when a flood disaster encountered once in five years
happens, nearly 3.2% arable land in Jilin district of the main stream of Songhua River,
and almost 4.8% arable land in Heilongjiang district of the main stream of Songhua

River will be affected, etc. Concerning disaster-affected rate of arable land, the flood
disaster risk lying in Songhua River Basin is relatively low.

5 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, based on the short time series of flood disaster historic data, the flood
disaster risk estimation in Songhua River Basin has been done divisionally through
flood disaster loss probability distribution estimation using information diffusion
method, which is superior to the traditional statistic model. It is worth to mention that
the division for Songhua River Basin in this paper is comparatively cursory, so that
the analysis results can not yet completely reflect the spatial differences of flood
disaster risk. More accurate division will definitely help to understand the spatial
characteristics of flood disaster risk of Songhua River Basin, but the collection of
historic disaster data is extremely difficult. In view of the facts that the theoretic
system of flood risk evaluation has not been perfect enough so far, and the observed
series of flood disaster are quite short or even unavailable, the method based on
information diffusion adopted in the paper is indisputably an effective and practical
method. However, when it comes to the form and adaptive condition of diffusion
function and the determination of diffusion coefficients, further in-depth research
should be conducted in the future, in order to ensure the estimation probability values
get much closer to the real happening values.
