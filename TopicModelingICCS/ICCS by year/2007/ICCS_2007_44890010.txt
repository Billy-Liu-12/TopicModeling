Abstract. This paper presents a new method for rotation invariant texture classification based on Gabor wavelets. The Gabor representation has been shown
to be optimal in the sense of minimizing the joint two-dimensional uncertainty
in space and frequency, and the Gabor wavelet can be used to decompose an
image into multiple scales and multiple orientations. Two group features, i.e.
the global feature vector and local feature matrix, can be constructed by the
mean and variance of the Gabor filtered image. The global feature vector is rotation invariant, and the local feature matrix can be adjusted by a circular shift
operation to rotation invariant so that all images have the same dominant direction. By the two group features, a discriminant can be found to classify the rotated images. In the primary experiments, comparatively high correct classification rates were obtained using a large sample sets with 1998 rotated images of
111 Brodazt texture classes.
Keywords: Texture Classification, Gabor Wavelet.

1 Introduction
Texture analysis is a fundamental issue in image analysis and computer vision, and
has many potential applications, for example, in object recognition, biomedical image
analysis and so on. Texture analysis has been an active research topic for more than
three decades, but only a limited number of examples of successful exploration of
texture exist. A major problem is that textures in the real world are often not uniform
due to variations in orientation, scale, or other visual appearance.
Analysis of texture requires the identification of proper attributes or features that
differentiate the textures for classification. There are numerous algorithms in the open
literature for texture feature extraction and classification. The most common approaches to texture classification assume, either explicitly or implicitly, that all images are captured under the same orientation and the unknown samples to be classified are identical to the training samples with respect to spatial scale and orientation.
However, it is unrealistic to control the environment to ensure a zero rotation angle.
In general, the approach towards developing rotation invariant techniques has been
to modify successful non-rotation invariant techniques such as statistical methods,

MRF (Markov random fields) and so on [1]. These traditional statistical approaches to
texture analysis such as co-occurrence matrices, second order statistics, GaussMarkov random fields and local linear transforms, are restricted to the analysis of
spatial interaction over relatively small neighborhoods on a single scale.
More recently, multi-resolution and multi-channel techniques have gained much attention for texture analysis, such as wavelet transform and Gabor filters. Based on
filters with Gabor wavelet or other basis functions, the rotation invariant is realized by
computing rotation invariant features from the filtered images or by converting rotation variant features to rotation invariant features. Porter and Canagarajah compared
three mainstream paradigms: wavelets, GMRF, Gabor for rotation invariant classification [2]. The wavelet transform decomposes an image into only three orientations, i.e.,
horizontal, diagonal and vertical detail sub bands in the direction of 0 , 45 and 90 ,
respectively, apart from the approximation smooth sub-band. This limits the application of wavelet transform for rotation invariant texture analysis [3].
From two aspects of theory analysis and practices, it is true that Gabor filter has
obvious advantages, compared with other methods. For feature-based approaches,
rotation invariant is achieved by using anisotropic features. Gabor function can be
appropriately considered as an orientation and scale tunable detector. The banks of
Gabor filters are a group of wavelet, which one can capture the signal or feature at a
specific frequency and a specific orientation. There are some approaches based on
Gabor filters, which focus on the rotation invariant texture in [3-8], but most of them
only work well on a small database and need a lot of samples for training. Haley and
Manjunath used 13 classes of textures to obtain 96.4% correct classification, however
only 80.4% on 109 classes of textures [4]. Tan used 15 classes of textures to obtain
89.3% correct classification [5]. Manthalkar and Biswas obtained 81.02% correct
classification on 60 classes of textures [6].
The motivation of this paper is to classify rotation invariant textures in a large texture database from the Brodatz album with 1998 rotated texture images derived from
them by extracting global and local Gabor wavelet based features. The algorithm
discussed in this paper is based on a feature space constructed from Gabor filter responses, in which each texture has the corresponding (unique) global feature and
circular shift local feature. Then, a similarity measure, which combined the global and
local features, is used to compare the unknown samples with the feature of known
textures. The primary experiments have proven that the approach performs well in
applications, and only requires one sample of each texture class at

0 for training.

2 Gabor Wavelet
A two-dimensional Gabor function consists of a complex sinusoidal plane wave of
some frequency and orientations, modulated by a two- dimensional Gaussian envelope. A ‘canonical’ Gabor filter g ( x, y ) and its Fourier transform G (u , v ) can be
written as:

12

. Gabor functions form a complete but

nonorthogonal basis set. Expanding a signal using this basis provides a localized frequency description. A class of self-similar functions, referred to as Gabor wavelets in
the following discussion, is now considered. Let g ( x, y ) be the mother Gabor wavelet, then this self-similar filter dictionary can be obtained by appropriate dilations and
rotations of g ( x, y ) through the generating function [9]:

g mn ( x, y ) = a − m g ( x' , y ' ) , a > 1 , m, n = integer

Most Gabor filters have a slight response to the absolute intensity. This results in
sensitivity to the background luminance level, which signifies a first order difference
between regions. This can be avoided by adding a constant to make them zero mean.
Because the Gabor filter is built in the Fourier domain, this same purpose (effect) is
achieved by setting G(0,0)=0.

3 Feature Extractions and Classification
3.1 Texture Representation
Given an image I ( x, y ) of size
given by convolution:

M ∗ N , its discrete Gabor wavelet transform is

∗
H mn ( x, y ) = ∑∑ I ( x − p, y − q ) g mn
( p, q )
p

Where
of

(8)

q

∗
p , q are the filter mask size variables, g mn
( p, q ) is the complex conjugate

g mn .

A set of Gabor wavelet of different scale and orientation is convolved with an image
to estimate the magnitude of local frequency of the appropriate scale and orientation.
It is assumed that the texture regions are spatially homogeneous. So after applying
Gabor filters on the image with orientation at different scale, the ‘energy’ content is
obtained using:

E (m, n) = ∑∑ H mn ( x, y )
M

The mean

efficients are used to construct two-group (local and global) features to represent the
homogeneous textures.

r (Wm ,θ n ) = ( μ mn , σ mn ) as the

unique feature at a certain orientation at a specific scale, the first group feature is
denoted as the local feature:

⎜ r (W1 , θ 0 ) r (W1 , θ1 )

For convenience, typical matrix indexing is used in

FG , FG (1,1) = r (W0 , θ 0 )

FGSK = r (WS −1 , θ K −1 ) . Another group of the texture features is obtained from
sum of a certain frequency Wm at all orientations:
and

Em = ∑ r (Wm , θ n )

n

Because the scheme of Gabor filter design have covered all space frequency plane
nearly uniformly, a global rotation invariant feature vector can formed as
E = [ E1 , E2 , … ES ] .
3.2 Rotation Invariant Measurement
In this paper, the anisotropic textures are emphasized as which we paid more attentions to them. Because a texture is perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, any texture
descriptor would be rotation invariant. So, due to the anisotropic textures, a hypothesis is always correct in saying that there is a dominant pair of orientation and frequency in its Fourier spectrum, which means there is a r (Wm , θ n ) with highest
energy.
Now, a column-wise circular shift of local feature matrix

FG can be defined as:

FG k = ( FG (1 : S , k : K ) FG (1 : S ,1 : k − 1))

(13)

This column-wise circular shift operation is used to rearrange local feature matrix

FG so that its dominant orientation can be in the first column of FG ' = FG k .
Now, the direct distance metric can be defined between the query image Q and a
target image T in the database as:

r (Wm , θ n ) = ( μ mn ) 2 + (σ mn ) 2 , r (Wm , θ n ) ∈ G '

d mn (Q, T ) = r Q (Wm ,θ n ) − r T (Wm ,θ n ) = ( μ mn

(15)

Based on the local feature matrix

Actually, in this paper, the texture similarity measurements are accomplished by
defining the differentia measurement:

df = min(df E ∗ df FG ∗ df D )

(19)

This similarity measurement is the rotation invariant, and emphasis that variety ratio of global and local ‘energy’ between the query image Q and a target image T is
smallest if

Q is the same as or very similar to T .

4 Experiments
In order to test the efficiency of the proposed method for rotation invariant texture
analysis, experiments are carried out on a texture database from the Brodatz texture
album, which is comprised of 111 texture images of size 512 × 512 . Each center
portion of size 256 × 256 from the respective texture image of size 512 × 512 is
used in the training phase. In the same way, the samples for testing can be obtained

but rotated in steps of 10 up to 180 . Texture classification is done with a total of
1998 rotated texture images (111 × 18 = 1998) for various combinations of scale
and orientation values of Gabor decomposition (scale is from 3 up to 5; orientation
from 4 up to 12). The center frequencies for Gabor filters are 0.05-0.4 and separated
by one octave-frequency bandwidth.
The results obtained for various combinations of scale and orientation values of
Gabor decomposition are given in Table 1. From Table 1, it can be shown that the
lowest mean correct classification rate of 85.0% is obtained at scale=3 and orientation=4 with 28 features (24 features of local feature matrix G plus 4 features of
global feature vector E ), and the highest mean correct classification rate of 96.0% is
obtained at scale=4 and orientation=12 with 100 features (96 features of local feature
matrix G plus 4 features of global feature vector E ). The next highest mean correct classification rate of 95.3% is at scale=5 and orientation=12 with 125 features
(120 features of local feature matrix G plus 5 features of global feature vector E ),
and at scale=4 and orientation=8 with 68 features (64 features of local feature matrix
G plus 4 features of global feature vector E ). And it is showed that the correct
classification rates increase approximately with scales and orientations increasing.
But, when scale is larger than 4, there is no vast difference between the mean classification rate obtained for different combination of scale and orientation values of
Gabor decomposition. In practice, the best combination can be decided by taking
into account the tradeoff (compromise) of the number of features and the minimum
correct classification rate.

5 Conclusions
A rotation invariant texture classification scheme using two group features (global
feature vector and local feature matrix) based on the Gabor wavelet is developed for a
reasonably large (111 classes) texture databases. Two group features, i.e. the global
feature vector and local feature matrix, can be constructed by the mean and variance
of the Gabor filtered image. Global feature vector is rotation invariant, and local feature matrix can be adjusted by a circular shift operation to rotation invariant so that all
images have the same dominant direction. By the two group features, a discriminant
can be found to classify rotated images. The primary experiments have proven that
the proposed approach is effective for rotation invariant texture classification.
There are many application areas such as automated inspection, large image database handling, remote sensing and medical image processing. Further research should
include its robustness to image noise, and scale invariant texture classification.
