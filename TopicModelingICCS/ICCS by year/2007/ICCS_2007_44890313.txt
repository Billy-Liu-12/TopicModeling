Introduction

In this paper, we consider only ﬁnite undirected graphs without loops and multiple edges. The set of vertices of graph G is denoted by V (G); the set of edges by
E(G). We use ν(G) to denote the cardinality of V (G). If H is a subgraph of G and
S is a subset of V (G), we denote by NH (S) the set of vertices in H which are adjacent to some vertex in S, and set | NH (S) |= dH (S). In particular, when H = G
and S = u, then let NG (u) = N (u) and let dG (u) = d(u). The binding number of
(X)|
| ∅ = X ⊂ V (G), NG (X) = V (G)}. We
G is deﬁned by bind(G) = min{ |NG
|X|
write EG (X, Y ) = {xy ∈ E(G) | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }, and eG (X, Y ) =| EG (X, Y ) |.
As usual, we use δ for the minimum degree of G. For other deﬁnitions and notations not deﬁned here, we refer the readers to [1]. Let G be a connected graph
of order n and let a, b be two integers such that 2 ≤ a ≤ b. Let g and f be
two integer-valued functions deﬁned on V (G) such that a ≤ g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ b. A
spanning subgraph F of G is called a (g, f + 1)-factor if g(x) ≤ dF (x) ≤ f (x) + 1
for every x ∈ V (F ). If F is connected, we call it a connected (g, f +1)-factor. The
purpose of this paper is to present a suﬃcient condition which guarantees the
existence of connected (g, f +1)-factors in graph G related to the binding number
dG−S (x), f (S) =
f (x)
of graph G. For convenience, we write dG−S (T ) =
x∈T

and f (T ) =

f (x).

Many authors have investigated factors, connected factors and factorizations
[3,5,7]. In this paper, we study conditions on the binding number and the order
of a graph G which guarantee the existence of a connected (g, f + 1)-factor in
G. We begin with some known results.
There is a well-known necessary and suﬃcient condition for a graph G to have
a (g, f )-factor which was given by Lov´
asz.
Theorem 1 ([6]). A graph G has a (g, f )-f actor if and only if
δ(S, T ) = f (S) + dG−S (T ) − g(T ) − h(S, T ) ≥ 0
for any disjoint subsets S and T of V(G), where h(S, T ) denotes the number
of components C of G − (S T ) such that g(x) = f (x) for all x ∈ V (C) and
f (x) is odd. Furthermore, if g(x) = f (x) for every x ∈
eG (T, V (C)) +
x∈V (C)

V (G), then δ(S, T ) = f (V (G))(mod 2).
M. Kano gave a result which shows the relation of binding numbers and
existence of f -factors.
Theorem 2 [2]. Let G be a connected graph of order n and let a and b be
integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b and 2 ≤ b. Let f be an integer-valued function
deﬁned on V (G) such that a ≤ f (x) ≤ b for every x ∈ V (G). Suppose that
2
n ≥ (a+b)
and
f (x) ≡ 0(mod 2). If
a

and for any nonempty independent subset X of V (G)
NG (X) ≥

(b − 1)n+ | X | −1
,
a+b−1

then G has an f -factor.
The following two results are essential to the proof of our main theorem.
Theorem 3 [4]. Let G be a graph and let g and f be two positive integer-valued
functions deﬁned on V(G) such that g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ dG (x) for all x ∈ V (G). If
G has both a (g,f )-factor and a Hamiltonian path, then G contains a connected
(g,f+1)-factor.
Theorem 4 [8]. If bind(G) ≥ 32 , then G has a Hamiltonian cycle.
Liu and Zhang proposed the following problem.
Problem [5]. Find suﬃcient conditions for graphs to have connected [a,b]factors related to other parameters in graphs such as binding number, neighbor
union and connectivity.

We now give our theorem which partially solve the above problem.
Theorem 5. Let G be a connected graph of order n, and let a and b be two
integers such that 2 ≤ a ≤ b. Let g and f be two integer-valued functions deﬁned
on V (G) such that a ≤ g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ b for every x ∈ V (G) and f (V (G)) is even.

Proof of the Theorem 5

In this section, we assume that G satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 5. Since
> 32 , according to Theorem 4, graph G has a Hamiltonian
bind(G) > (a+b)(n−1)
an
cycle. Hence by Theorem 3, to prove Theorem 5, we need only to prove that
graph G has a (g, f )-factor. At ﬁrst, we need some lammas.
Lemma 1. Suppose that G satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 5. Then |
NG (X) |> bn+|X|−1
for all nonempty subset X of V(G) with NG (X) = V (G)
a+b
bn
and δ(G) > a+b .
Proof. Let bind(G) > l, and Y = V (G) \ NG (X). Since NG (Y ) ⊆ V (G) \ X,
we obtain (n− | X |) ≥| NG (Y ) |> l | Y |= l(n− | NG (X) |. Therefore we have
| NG (X) |> ((l − 1)n+ | X |)/l, and δ(G) > ((l − 1)n + 1)/l.
, we have
Then replace l by (a+b)(n−1)
an−b
δ(G) >
Since n ≥

similarly we obtain
(an + bn − a − b − an)n + an | X |
(a + b)(n − 1)
bn(n − 1) − an + an | X |
=
(a + b)(n − 1)
bn+ | X | −1

| NG (X) | >

So
| NG (X) |>

bn+ | X | −1
.
a+b

(2)

We begin to prove that graph G has a (g, f )-factor. By contradiction, we suppose
that G has no (g, f )-factors. Then according to Theorem 1, there exist disjoint
subsets S and T of V (G) satisfying
f (S) + dG−S (T ) − g(T ) − h(S, T ) < 0.

(3)

J. Cai, G. Liu, and J. Hou

Let s =| S | and t =| T |. Then by Theorem 1 and (3) we have
as + dG−S (T ) − bt − ω ≤ −1,

(4)

where ω denotes the number of components of G − (S ∪ T ). Obviously,
ω ≤ n − s − t.

(5)

Let m denote the minimum order of components of G − (S ∪ T ). Then we know
that
n−s−t
m≤

(6)
ω
By the deﬁnition of m, it is obvious that
δ(G) ≤ m − 1 + s + t.

(7)

The following Claims hold.
Claim 1. T = ∅.
Proof. Otherwise T = ∅.
Case 1. S = ∅.
Since G is connected and δ(S, T ) < 0, h(S, T ) = 1. So obviously f (x) = g(x)
for every x ∈ V (G) by the deﬁnition of h(S, T ). Hence δ(S, T ) = −1. On the
other hand, since f (V (G)) is even, according to Theorem 1, δ(S, T ) is even. This
is a contradiction.
Case 2. S = ∅. Then by (4) and (5), we get
as + 1 ≤ ω ≤ n − s.
So from (1), (6), (7) and (8) we know that

This is a contradiction since a ≥ 2. So T = ∅.

(8)

Binding Number and Connected (g, f + 1)-Factors in Graphs

Since T = ∅ by Claim 1, let h = min{dH−S (x) | x ∈ T }.
Then obviously
δ(G) ≤ h + s.

317

(9)

Claim 2. h = 0.
Proof. If h = 0, let X = {x ∈ T | dG−S (x) = 0}. Then | X |= 0. From (2) we
get
bn+ | X | −1
.
(10)
s ≥| NG (X) |>
a+b
On the other hand, from (4),(5) we get
as − b | X | +(1 − b)(t− | X |) − (b − 1)(n − s − t) ≤ −1.
Thus
s≤

(b − 1)n+ | X | −1
.
a+b−1

From (10) and the above inequality, we get
bn+ | X | −1
(b − 1)n+ | X | −1
<
,
a+b
a+b−1
which means | X |> an + 1. This is a contradiction. So h = 0.
Claim 3. h < b.
Proof. Otherwise, h ≥ b. We consider two cases.
Case 1. h > b.
Then by (4),
as + (h − b)t − ω ≤ −1.

(11)

ω ≥ as + t + 1 ≥ s + t + 1.

(12)

And so

Since T = ∅ by Claim 1, ω ≥ 2.
First suppose that m ≥ 2. Then from (7) and (12) we get
bn
< δ(G) ≤ m − 1 + s + t ≤ m + ω − 2

This is a contradiction. Hence we may assume m = 1. Then from (12) and
(5) we have

This also is a contradiction.

Since n ≥ (a+b)
a
Case 1 and Case 2 we have known that h < b.
Hence, by Claim 2 and Claim 3 we have 1 ≤ h ≤ b − 1.
By (4),(5) and b − h ≥ 1, we obtain

which implies
s≤

Thus n < (a+b)

. Hence we

get the desired contradiction and conclude that G has a (g, f )-factor. Since G
has both a Hamiltonian path and a (g, f )-factor, according to Theorem 3, graph
G has a connected (g, f + 1)-factor.
The possible further problem in this topic is the following.
Question. Find the proper binding number and order of G which guarantees
the existence of connected k-factors in G.
