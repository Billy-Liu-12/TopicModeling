Abstract. Models for systems biology commonly adopt Differential Equations
or Agent-Based modeling approaches for simulating the processes as a whole.
These choices need not necessarily be mutually exclusive. We propose a hybrid
agent-based approach where biological cells are modeled as individuals (agents)
while chemical molecules are kept as quantities. This hybridization in entity
representation entails a combined modeling strategy with agent-based
behavioral rules and differential equations, thereby balancing requirements of
modeling extensibility with computational tractability. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach with a realistic model of chemotaxis based on receptor
kinetics involving an assay of 103 cells and 1.2x106 molecules. The simulation
is efficient and the results are agreeable with laboratory experiments.
Keywords: Hybrid Models, Multi-Agents, Chemotaxis, Receptor Kinetics.

1 Introduction
A large part of systems biology involves mathematical models constructed to
understand the biological system (such as the human immune system) as a whole [1]
from integrating knowledge obtained from laboratory experiments on sub-parts of the
system. To simulate these system level dynamics efficiently, such models necessarily
assume compartmentalized homogeneity and spatial independence [2, 3]. An
alternative approach that has been gaining popularity are Multi-Agent (or MA)
models, which explicitly model biological cells and molecules as individual agents
[4-7]. As the real biological systems comprise millions to trillions of cells, MA
models inevitably face issues of computational tractability and model scalability [8].
Despite these drawbacks, MA models are appealing for their advantages in
phenomenological encoding of biological cell behaviors as agent rules [8]. Attempts
have been made to overcome the computational tractability; such as choosing an
intermediate level of abstraction [6] and applying the model to a distributed or parallel
computational framework [9].
Though MA models generally deal with individuals instead of quantities, we
believe that the DE modeling techniques for characterizing aggregated dynamics can
be applied to MA models as well, giving rise to a hybrid modeling approach. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid approach for designing MA system models where cells
remain modeled as individual agents and molecules kept as quantities. This approach
is motivated by the morphological distinction between cells and molecules, where

molecules are much smaller (in the order of nanometers vs. cells in the order of
micrometers), more abundant, have less complex behaviors and are well-characterized
by physical laws (such as mass action law and Fick’s diffusion law) as compared to
cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a model of chemotaxis. Our
experimental design mimics the Under-Agarose Assay [10]: an in vitro experiment
designed to study the chemotactic behavior of cells. Simulation results are found to
be comparable with laboratory experiments.

2 Integrating Agents and Quantities
We consider the hybridization on two levels: globally in the environment, and locally
with a cell (on its surface and within its body).
The environment is where biological cells and molecules reside and interact. The
environment handles the storage and dissemination of spatial proximity information
of cells and molecules. Consider the neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) that are
attracted to the site of an injury as a result of communicated information in the form
of inflammatory signals. The spread of these inflammatory signals, which is
essentially based on molecular diffusion, is an environment level event. Together
with this, another exogenous event involves blood flow (within the blood vessels) that
forces the neutrophils and other related immune cells and molecules to recirculate in
the human body. And then, upon entering the damaged tissue, their movement
becomes more governed by the process of chemotaxis. Therefore, the environment is
not merely a passive ‘holder’ to place the agents, but an entity with its own activities
and special properties (e.g., blood flows). How agents behave is greatly influenced by
its environment, hence the modeling of the environment is vital to agent-based system
models of microbiological phenomena. We propose a three-layer environment,
namely, 1) An Agent Holder Layer, where all agents (individuals) reside, 2) A
Molecule Space Layer, where all molecule distributions are recorded, 3) A Flow Field
Layer, where background flows, such as blood flows and lymph flows are modeled.
Fig. 1a illustrates the three layers as composable two-dimensional planes.

The layers are either continuous or discrete in space. In continuous space layers,
real-valued coordinates are used. In the discrete space layers, values are only stored
at discrete ‘grid points’, hence values at real-valued coordinates may require

interpolation. Of the three layers, only the Agent Holder Layer is continuous. The
distance between two neighbouring grid points ΔL , for a discrete space determines its
granularity. Each grid point has a corresponding real-valued coordinate in the
continuous space of the Agent Holder Layer, and each agent coordinate falls within a
grid cell. The correspondence in spatial location enables spatial proximity-based interlayer communication.
The Molecule Space Layer consists of sub-layers, each representing the spatial
distribution of a certain type of molecule. We let Qi , j denote the number of molecules
surrounding the grid point (i, j ) . In our model, the net change in molecule quantity
over the entire spatial distribution is a combined result of 1) Molecular Production,
where cells synthesize and release cytokines into its neighbourhood according to
specific agent rules, 2) Molecular Diffusion, where molecules spread due to Brownian
movement based on Fick’s diffusion law, 3) Fluid Mechanics, in which molecules are
‘pushed’ by the local fluid flow within certain compartments such as the blood vessels
and lymph duct. This is modeled by sampling the local velocity of the flow from the
Flow Field Layer, and computing the quantity shift along the flow velocity by
redistributing the molecular quantity to neighbouring grid points, and 4) Molecular
Consumption / Degradation, where certain molecules are ‘consumed’ by binding to
cell receptors. Molecules also decay through various pathways (e.g., instability or
enzymic reactions), which is quantitatively specified by the decay rate constants ( λ )
or half-life values ( t1/ 2 ).
The Flow Field Layer characterizes the background flow in the environment. It
represents the systematic transport superimposed onto the random movements of
molecules and agents. The flow velocity Fi, j is specified for each grid point (i, j ) ,
The Flow Field Layer is sampled by the Molecule Space Layer for computing the
systematic shift of molecules, as stated in point (3) above.
The agents in the Agent Holder Layer move not only passively via systematic
transport due to existence of flow, but also actively in response to the local molecular
concentration and gradient, exhibiting chemokinesis and chemotaxis. Formally, we
specify the displacement of an agent Δp within time Δt as a function of the local flow
velocity Fp , molecular concentration Cm,p and gradient G m,p for a set of
molecules m . Consider an agent in Fig. 1b, whose nearest grid points are (i, j ) ,
(i, j + 1) , (i + 1, j ) , and (i + 1, j + 1) . The local concentration of molecule m at the
agent’s position obtained by bilinear interpolation is:
C m,p = (Qi, j v x v y + Qi +1, j wx v y + Qi, j +1v x w y + Qi +1, j +1 wx w y ) ΔL2

with wx = Δx ΔL , v x = 1 − Δx ΔL

The local gradient G m,p = ∇C m,p is a vector with components:

The functional form of Δp Δt is determined by the agent’s ruleset based on its
biological properties: some types of cells are highly motile and sensitive to molecular
stimuli while others are rather fixed.
We have described the hybrid modeling of the environment. We next introduce the
interaction rule building scheme for biological cells.
Biological cells are modeled at the individual level as agents, and their behaviors
are specified by a set of rules. Most MA models use phenomenological if-then rules
[7, 11]. In reality, cell behaviors emerge from complex signaling pathways of
molecular interactions and chemical reactions [6]. Therefore we believe the
incorporation of molecular interactions (through surface receptors) into agent rules is
necessary for a more quantitatively accurate MA model. As a first step, we develop a
model for cellular locomotion through receptor kinetics [12]. We assume an agent’s
behaviour is governed by the following events: 1) Receptor-ligand binding, where
free ligand molecules bind to receptors on the cell surface, 2) Receptor internalization
and ligand consumption, where the receptor-ligand complex are internalized into the
cytosol, and ligand is ‘used up’/digested by other biological processes, and 3)
Receptor recycling, where the previously internalized receptors are returned to the
cell surface, available for binding.

The leftmost panel in Table 1 gives the molecular reactions of the three events
underlying receptor kinetics. L and R denote individual ligand and receptor
molecules respectively. The labels on the arrows characterize the probability of
reaction per unit time. The right panel gives the corresponding differential equations,
which are the macroscopic quantity-level changes that emerge from the individual
reactions and are derived through mass action law. The rate constants K x
( x ∈ {b, i, r} ) are proportional to their microscopic counterpart k x and denote the
number of reactions per unit time per reactant(s). By convention, [•] represents the
concentration of the molecules in the whole space, but here we will define it as
quantities of molecules in the proximity of, or within the agent. Readers may find
these equations familiar, however, we emphasize that instead of a direct overall
description of the molecular kinetics, these equations are local to an agent.

Table 2 expresses the agent rule that utilizes these equations for updating the local
molecule quantities [L] , [R ] , [LR ] , and [R *] . The rule we specify here is quite flat as
there is only one proposition and all the equations appear in the action part. However,
it is possible to specify more complex situations that an agent can be in and the
different responses it could make. We incorporate this receptor-ligand interaction in a
hybrid model of chemotaxis in the next Section.

3 Chemotaxis
Chemotaxis refers to the directed cell movement towards or away from a chemical
source (chemoattractant or chemorepellent) by sensing and following the chemical
gradient [13]. Through chemotaxis, a sperm cell finds the ovum, and a white blood
cell finds the place of injury or inflammation [13]. Much of the research effort has
been devoted to discover the mechanisms that transduce the extracellular chemical
signals into cell locomotion [14-16], including molecular events such as G-protein
activation, lipid remodeling, protein kinase activation, calcium elevation [13, 15] and
cellular events such as cell polarization, pseudopod extension, excitation and
adaptation [13, 16]. However, these molecular details are seldom captured
quantitatively into models for simulation. Keller and Segel used Partial-DEs to model
chemotaxis [17]: both cells and molecules are treated as quantities, hence the
intracellular molecule kinetics are largely ignored. Our model differs in that
chemotactic behaviors are described at an individual level instead of a population
level. Though the model we present here is simplified, the hybrid approach makes it
possible to incorporate more complex intracellular signaling pathways for future
extensions. We next describe how an agent’s displacement is computed based on our
model of chemotaxis.
We define the overall displacement of an agent (or cell) as the vector sum of
Brownian, chemotactic and systematic displacement due to external fluid flows. In
this experiment, we define chemotactic response to be proportional to the difference
in the receptor occupancy of the front and rear of the cell [18]. The receptor-ligand
interactions have been described in Equation (4) to (7). Let r and V represent the
radius and the volume of an cell, and let [R] , [LR] , [ R * ] represent the quantities of
the free surface receptors, occupied surface receptors and the internalized receptors
respectively. The amount of ligand available at the front and the rear of the cell is
approximated by:

124

Z. Guo and J.C. Tay

[ L] front = (C + | G | r )V / 2 , [ L] rear = (C − | G | r )V / 2

(8)

The change in newly bound receptors ( LR ) in time Δt at the front and rear are:
Δ[ LR ] front = K b [ L] front [ R ] front Δt , Δ[ LR ] rear = K b [ L] rear [ R ] rear Δt

(9)

and we assume [ R] front = [ R]rear = [ R] / 2 . The difference in newly bound receptors
between the cell front and the rear in time Δt is therefore
Δ[ LR ] diff = K b ([ L ] front − [ L ] rear )[ R]Δt 2

(10)

Assuming linear dependency of the agent’s displacement on Δ[ LR] diff gives rise to
Δp = kΔ[ LR ] diff G / | G |

(11)

where k is a proportionality parameter. The larger the value of k , the more sensitive
is the cell is to the change in receptor occupancy at its front and rear.
We conduct an in silico simulation of the Under-Agarose Assay, which was
designed to investigate the in vitro chemotactic behavior of lymphoblastic cells [10].
Fig. 2 illustrates the assay and a sample result. The tissue culture dish is filled with
Agarose (gel) and two wells are incised, where one is filled with cells and the other
with a chemoattractant (lysophosphatidylcholine). The cells are observed to migrate
towards the chemoattractant well by squeezing under the gel (Fig. 2).

To mimic the Under-Agarose Assay, we construct a virtual environment as a 3mm
by 2mm enclosed two-dimensional space (Fig. 3, left). The cell and attractant wells
are both 250µm in radius and are placed 1mm apart (Fig. 3, left, red circle). Initially,

the cell well is filled with 1000 cells, and the attractant well is filled with attractant
molecules at a concentration of 2500 particles per 20µm×20µm area (for a total of
about 1.2x106 molecules). Table 3 summarizes the parameter values for the
simulation.
The simulation model is implemented in Java. The simulation is run on a
Windows XP Professional system with 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 CPU and 1GB of
Memory. One single run of the simulation takes approximately 3 minutes. The video
capture of the simulation can be downloaded freely from http://www.ntu.edu.sg/
home/asjctay/data/chemotaxis.zip (7.56 MB in size).
Fig. 3 shows the simulation results with k set to 5 and 30. The left figures show
the migration pattern at time step t=5000. Both exhibit the biased random walk of the
cells towards the attractant, and with larger k values, the spread accelerates. Due to
ligand consumption, the space occupied by the cells is at a lower concentration,
resulting in a sharp gradient at the edge of the diffusing molecular population, which
promotes the movement of cells. The right figures show the movement of the front
( xmax ), rear ( xmin ), and mean ( xavg ) positions of the molecular migration shape over
time. Lx and L y denotes the bounding width and length of this shape along the x and
y axes, and L x / L y measures its distortion. Interestingly, though the spread towards
the source of the attractant is evident, the average shift along the x axis is very small,

as a large amount of the cells are still within the cell well and exhibit no chemotactic
movement. This is likely due to low concentration created by the front-end cells,
hence the rear-end cells are blocked from sensing the distant gradient. For k =30 the
distortion maximizes at t=1500, showing that cells are attracted along the x axis. The
distortion then slowly decreases, indicating increasing spread along the y axis due to
gradient created at the edge of the migration shape. The cells spread rather than move
with a narrow front, hence our results differ from the illustration from [10] but closer
to the photo in [19] (see Fig. 2). Our simulation results show that the spread is caused
by the distortion of the gradient landscape due to both diffusion and interactions
between cells and molecules. The efficacy of the hybrid approach to construct agentbased models for biological phenomena has been demonstrated with a model of
chemotaxis verified qualitatively with laboratory experimentation.

4 Conclusions
We present a hybrid agent-based modeling approach, where biological cells are
modeled as individual agents and molecules as quantities, thereby balancing
requirements of modeling extensibility (i.e. to handle complex cell behaviors) with
computational tractability. The hybridization of the quantity-based macroscopic
modeling (for molecules) and the individual-based microscopic modeling (for cells)
exists at both the environment and individual levels. The environment consists of
three layers: an Agent Holder Layer, a Molecule Space Layer (divided into several
sub-layers), and a Field Layer. Agents (individual cells) interact with molecules
(quantities) based on spatial proximity. The model allows agent behaviors to be
specified by differential equations, if-then logic, or a hybrid of both. The result is a
modeling approach that provides extensibility and increased accuracy based on
available information. We demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid approach with a
realistic model of chemotaxis based on receptor kinetics for an Under-Agarose assay
of 103 cells and 1.2x106 molecules. The experiment successfully and efficiently
reproduces a “biased random walk” as reported in the research literature, with results
showing strong agreement with migration patterns observed from laboratory
experiments.
