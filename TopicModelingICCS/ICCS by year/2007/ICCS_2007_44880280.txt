Abstract. Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate
the endohedral and exohedral adsorption of a H2 molecule on the classical and
nonclassical fullerenes Cx (x=58, 59, 60, 62) with seven-, eight-, and ninemembered rings. The amplitude of adsorption energies are within 0.03eV and
the molecule-fullerene interaction belongs to van der Waals type. Penetration of
a H2 molecule through different fullerene cages was discussed and the
corresponding energy barriers were obtained. We find that the existence of
large holes reduces the penetration barrier from 12.6 eV for six-membered ring
on perfect C60 cage to about 8eV for seven-membered rings and to about 5eV
for eight-membered rings.

1 Introduction
Soon after the discovery of carbon fullerenes, it was found that a variety of atoms
and molecules can be incorporated into the hollow carbon cages to form endohedral
complex structures, which lead to new nanoscale materials with novel physical and
chemical properties [1-3]. Endohedral fullerenes are not only of scientific interest
but are of technological importance for their potential usage in various fields such
as molecular electronics [4], magnetic resonance imaging [5], quantum computer
[6-9], and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis [10, 11]. On the other hand,
tremendous efforts have been devoted to the hydrogen storage in carbon
nanostructures like nanotubes [12]. Thus, the study of endohedral fullerene
complexes with encapsulation of H2 molecule is focus of interests from different
aspects.
In order to achieve endohedral fullerene complex with hydrogen molecule
encapsulated inside, the surface of the fullerene cages must be opened to have a
sufficiently large orifice to let the H2 molecule penetrate. Murata et al. investigated

the synthesis, structure, and properties of novel open-cage fullerenes with heteroatom
on the rim of the orifice [13] as well as the feasibility of inserting small atoms or
molecules through the orifice of an open-cage C60 derivative. Hatzimarinaki et al.
reported a novel methodology for the preparation of five-, seven-, and nine-membered
fused rings on C60 fullerene [14].
Recently, molecular hydrogen was successfully placed inside open-cage
fullerenes [13, 15-21]. Murata et al. [16] reported the first syntheses and X-ray
structures of organic and organometallic derivatives of C60 and the usage of the
encapsulated molecular hydrogen as a magnetic shielding probe. After the
encapsulation of H2, the endohedral cages were then closed through a
“molecularsurgery” method on a gram scale with maximum 100% H2 incorporation
[20]. Stimulated by these experimental progresses, ab initio computational studies
have been reported for endohedral H2@C60 complex. Slanina et al. performed
theoretical calculations of the encapsulation energy using modified Perdew-Wang
and Becke functionals (MPWB1K) [22]. Shigetaa et al. studied dynamic charge
fluctuation of endohedral fullerene with H2 [23].
In addition to the opening and closing of fullerene cages via chemical
approaches, it is possible to have the as-prepared defect fullerene cages with large
holes [24-26]. For example, Qian et al. detected pronounced peak of C62- on the LDFTMS mass spectrum and performed DFT calculation of the C62 cage with one
4MR [24]. Deng et al. observed the odd-numbered clusters C59 in laser desorption
ionization of C60 oxides [26]. Accordingly, ab initio calculatons have been carried
out for the geometries, energies, and stabilities of these defective fullerene C60
cages [27-29]. Hu et al. computed fullerene cages with large hole. [27, 28].
Lee studied the structure and stability of the defective fullerenes of C59, C58 and
C57 [29].
Despite the existing theoretical efforts, within the best of our knowledge, there is
no ab initio calculation on the hydrogen adsorption and encapsulation in the defect
fullerenes. These nonclassical fullerenes with seven-membered ring (7MR), eightmembered ring (8MR), and so on, may serve well as model systems for the open-cage
fullerenes obtained from other methods. Thus, it would be interesting to study the
relationship between the size of the orifice ring and the barrier for H2 molecule
penetrating from outside to inside of fullerene. In this paper, we address these issues
by conducting DFT calculations on the adsorption and penetration of H2 molecule on
C60 and nonclassical fullerenes with 7MR, 8MR, and 9MR.

2 Computational Methods
All-electron DFT calculations were carried out employing the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) with the PW91 functional [30] and the double numerical
plus polarization (DNP) basis set that are implemented in the DMol program [31].
Self-consistent field (SCF) calculations were carried out with a convergence criterion
of 10-6 a.u. on the total energy. To ensure high quality results, the real-space global
orbital cutoff radius was chosen to be as high as 5.0 Å. It is known that DFT method

282

within GGA approximation is usually insufficient for describing the weakly van der
Waals (vdW) interaction. A recent DFT calculation of the hydrogen adsorption on
carbon and boron nitride nanotubes [32] demonstrated that PW91 functional can
roughly reproduce the strength of the vdW interaction between a H2 molecule and a
C6H6 benzene molecule by highly accurate HF-MP2 calculations.

3 Results and Discussion
In this work, we considered eight fullerene cages including perfect C60 and those
defect fullerenes. The configurations of the defect fullerene cages were taken from
Ref. [29] for C58 and C59 with 7MR, 8MR, and 9MR, and from Ref. [24] for C62 with
4MR. On the one side, cages with the vacancy defect (unsaturated atom) were created
by removing one atom from C60, such as C59 4-9 (with one 4MR and one 9MR) and
C59_5-8 (with one 5MR and one 8MR). On the other hand, topological defects
including larger rings (7MR and 8MR) or smaller 4MR were created on the fullerene
cages of C58, C60, and C62. For C60, we considered perfect C60 (Ih) as well as a C60 cage
with two 7MR (along with one 4MR), which is denoted as C60 4-7-7. For C59, the
cage with one 4MR and one 9MR is denoted as H2@C59_4-9, and the cage with one
5MR and one 8MR as H2@C59_5-8. For C58, the cage with two 5MR and one 7MR is
denoted as H2@C58_5-5-7, the cage with two 4MR, one 8MR, and one 5MR as
H2@C58 4-4-8(5), and the cage with two 4MR, one 8MR, and one 6MR as H2@C58 44-8(6).
At the beginning, eight fullerene cages were optimized at level of PW91/DNP.
Hydrogen molecule was then placed in the center of each cage as initial
configuration of the endohedral complexes. These endohedral H2@Cx complexes
were fully optimized. The optimized structures are shown in Figure 1. Moreover,
exohedral adsorption of H2 molecule on these eight cages was also considered. The
adsorption energy of hydrogen molecule is defined as the difference between the
total energy of the H2-cage complex specie and summation of the total energies of
the individual H2 molecule (EH2) and the fullerene cage (Ecage). Hence, the adsorption
energies for both endohedral (Eendo) and exohedral adsorption (Eexo) are computed
from
Eendo=Eendo-H2—Ecage—EH2

(1)

Eexo=Eexo-H2—Ecage—EH2

(2)

To study the penetration behavior of a H2 molecule from the endohedral site to the
exohedral site, we first adjust the orientation of the central H2 molecule to be
perpendicular to the largest hole on the surface of the fullerene cages. Then, singlepoint energies of the H2-cage complex (H2@C60, H2@C60_4-7-7, H2@C59_4-9,
H2@C59_5-8, H2@C58_5-5-7, H2@C58_4-4-8(5), and H2@C58_4-4-8(6)) were computed
along the penetration path by gradually moving the H2 molecule from the cage center
to the outside of the fullerene cage through the largest hole by a step of 0.3 Å up to

The total energy between perfect C60 and defect C60_4-7-7 is 3.47 eV. In other
words, formation of two 7MR and one 4MR on perfect C60 requires 3.47 eV, while
previous calculation found that formation of two 7MR on a (6,6) carbon nanotube is
2.74 eV [33]. The total energy of C59_5-8 is lower than C59_4-9 by 0.91 eV, close to
the theoretical value of 0.89 eV by Lee et al. at level of B3LYP/6-31G* [29]. For C58,
C58_5-5-7 is more stable than C58_4-4-8(5) by 1.40 eV and than C58_4-4-8(6) by 4.67
eV, rather close to previous results of 1.34 eV and 4.77 eV by Lee [29].

As shown in Table I, for all the cases studied, the exohedral adsorption of H2
molecule on the surface of fullerene cage is exothermic, with Eexo ranging from -16.6
to -26.3 meV. The exohedral adsorption energy of H2 molecule is insensitive to the
atomic configuration of fullerene cages. Experimentally, the adsorption of a H2
molecule on the graphite surface is -42 meV. It is known that GGA usually
underestimate the surface adsorption energy of vdW type [34]. Therefore, the present
GGA calculation might somewhat underestimate the adsorption energy of H2
molecule.
On the contrary, the endohedral adsorption is either exothermic or endothermic,
with Eendo ranging from -12.6 to 31.8 meV. The incorporation of a H2 molecule in C60
(perfect or defect) and C62 cages is exothermic, while encapsulation of a H2 molecule
in C58 and C59 cages is endothermic. This finding can be roughly understood by the
difference in the interior space of the fullerene cages. In other words, C60 and C62
cages are larger and have more space for the encapsulation of H2 molecule. In a
previous study [22], the best estimate for the encapsulation energy for H2@C60 was at
least 173 meV.
The energy barrier for the penetration of H2 molecule through the largest hole of
the eight different fullerene cages are presented in Table 1 and the corresponding
single-point energies for the penetration paths are shown in Figure 2. First of all, in
Figure 2 we find all the energy paths for the H2 penetration are smooth and
have clear highest peak on them, which correspond to the energy barriers given in
Table 1. Among them, the energy barrier for penetrating the six-membered ring on
C60 cage is highest, i.e., 12.6 eV, and the energy barrier for penetrating the eightmembered ring on C58_4-4-8(5) cage is lowest, i.e, 4.6 eV. The energy barriers for
other cages with 8MR such as C59_5-8 and C58_4-4-8(6) are close, both of 5.2 eV.
For those defect fullerene cages with 7MR, such as C60_4-7-7 and C58_5-5-7, the
energy barriers are around 8 eV. In other words, the penetration barrier reduces
from 12.6 eV for 6MR on perfect C60 cage to about 8eV for 7MR and to about 5eV
for 8MR. However, it is interesting to find that the penetration barrier through the
largest 9MR on the C59_4-9 cage is relatively high, i.e., 9.1 eV.
To summarize, the encapsulation and penetration of H2 molecule on the perfect and
defect C60 cages were investigated using density functional theory at level of
PW91/DNP. Fullerene cages of Cx with x=58, 59, 60, 62 containing 7MR, 8MR, and
9MR were considered. The interaction for H2 molecule adsorption on fullerene cages
is relatively weak and of vdW type. The exohedral adsorption for H2 molecule on the
surface of fullerene cage is exothermic, while the endohedral adsorption is exothermic
for C60 and C62 or endothermic for C58 and C59 cages. The penetration barrier from
endohedral to exohedral site significantly reduces from 12.6 eV for 6MR perfect cage
to about 8 eV for 7MR and to about 5 eV for 8MR on defect cages. However, these
reduced energy barriers for 7MR and 8MR are still too high for a H2 molecule to
penetrate at ambient conditions. Finally, it is worthy to point out that the present
calculations focus on the physisorption and penetration of H2 molecule while the
possible chemisorption of the H2 molecule and corresponding transition states were
not considered.
