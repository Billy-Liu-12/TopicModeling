Abstract. The problem of mixed convection in a driven cavity packed
with porous medium is studied with lattice Boltzmann method. A lattice Boltzmann model for incompressible ﬂow in porous media and another thermal lattice Boltzmann model for solving the energy equation
are proposed based on the generalized volume-averaged ﬂow model. The
present models have been validated by simulating mixed convection in
a driven cavity (without porous medium) and it is found that the numerical results predicted by present models are in good agreement with
available data reported in previous studies. Extensive parametric studies
on mixed convection in a driven cavity ﬁlled with porous medium are
carried out for various values of Reynolds number, Richardson number
and Darcy number. It is found that the ﬂow and temperature patterns
change greatly with variations of these parameters.
Keywords: Lattice Boltzmann method; Mixed convection; Porous

Introduction

Fluid ﬂow and heat transfer in a driven cavity have recently received increasing attention because of its wide applications in engineering and science [1,2].
Some of these applications include oil extraction, cooling of electronic devices
and heat transfer improvement in heat exchanger devices [3]. From a practical
point of view, the research on mixed convection in a driven cavity packed with
porous medium is motivated by its wide applications in engineering such as petroleum reservoirs, building thermal insulation, chemical catalytic reactors, heat
exchangers, solar power collectors, packed-bed catalytic reactors, nuclear energy

systems and so on [3,4]. These important applications have led to extensive investigations in this area [3,5,6,7].
In this paper, the problem of mixed convection in a driven cavity packed
with porous medium is studied with the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The
aim of the present study is to examine the eﬀects of Reynolds number (Re),
Richardson number (Ri) and Darcy number (Da) on characteristics of the ﬂow
and temperature ﬁelds. The numerical results in present work indicate that the
ﬂow and temperature patterns change greatly with variations of the parameters
mentioned above. Furthermore, as these parameters are varied in a wide range,
some new phenomena is observed.

Numerical Method: The Lattice Boltzmann Method

In the past two decades, the LBM achieved great success in simulating complex
ﬂuid ﬂows and transport phenomena since its emergence [8]. In the present work,
the LBM is extended to study mixed convection in a driven cavity ﬁlled with
porous medium.

Through the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and in the incompressible limit, we
can derive the macroscopic equations (1)-(3). The further detailed analysis on
this procedure can be found in Refs. [10,12]. In addition, the boundary conditions should be treated carefully, here the non-equilibrium extrapolation scheme
proposed in Ref. [13] is used, this is because this scheme has exhibited better
numerical stability in numerical simulations.

Numerical Results and Discussion

The conﬁguration described in present study is shown in Fig. 1. The geometry is
a square cavity with a length L = 1. The cavity is packed with a porous material
that is homogeneous and isotropic.
The present models were validated by simulating mixed convection in a square
cavity with a driving lid for Re = 100, 400, 1000 and the corresponding Ri =
1 × 10−2 , 6.25 × 10−4 , 1 × 10−4 . The results were compared with available data

cavity without porous medium can be derived if Da → ∞, → 1 and σ = 1. As
shown in Tables 1 and 2, the present numerical results are in good agreement
with those reported in previous studies. In the following parts, we will focus on

investigating the eﬀect of variations of parameters, including Re, Ri and Da, on
ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds. The porosity of the medium is set to be 0.5, and
the Prandtl number is set to equal 0.71. Numerical simulations are carried out
on a 257×257 lattice.
3.1

Eﬀect of the Reynolds Number (Re)

The range of Re is tested from 400 to 5000 under the condition of Ri = 0.0001
and Da = 0.01. As shown in Fig. 2, the variation of Re has an important impact
on ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds. It is found that the qualitative character of ﬂow is
similar to the convectional lid-driven cavity ﬂow of non-stratiﬁed ﬂuid, a primary
vortex is formed in center region of the cavity, and small vortexes are visible near
the bottom corners with increasing Re. For temperature ﬁeld, it is observed that
there is a steep temperature gradient in the vertical direction near the bottom,
and a weak temperature gradient in the center region. It is important that the
convective region is enlarged with Re increases.

Eﬀect of the Richardson Number (Ri)

The Richardson number is deﬁned as the ratio of Gr/Re2 , which provides a
measure of the importance of buoyancy-driven natural convection relative to
lid-driven cavity force convection. It reﬂects a dominant conduction mode as
Ri ≥ O(1), while it resembles similar driven cavity ﬂow behavior for a nonstratiﬁed ﬂuid if Ri ≤ O(1) [2,6]. In the present work, Ri is varied in the range

of 0.0001 − 10 for Re = 100, Da = 0.01. As shown in Fig. 3, the ﬂow and
temperature ﬁelds change with the variations of Ri. As Ri ≤ 0.01, the buoyancy
eﬀect is overwhelmed by the mechanical eﬀect of the sliding lid, and only a
primary vortex close to the top boundary is observed. As Ri increases to 1.0,
beside the primary vortex mentioned above, another vortex is formed near the
bottom corners. However, with increasing Ri, the vortex near the bottom corner
moves toward the geometric center, and ﬁnally comes to the center of the cavity
as Ri is up to 10. It is also shown that, as Ri ≥ O(1), i.e., the eﬀect of buoyancy
is more prominent than mechanical eﬀect of the sliding lid, the phenomena in
driven cavity is more complex. The isothermals in Fig. 3 show the fact that
heat transfer is mostly conductive in the middle and bottom parts of the cavity.
The relative uniform temperature is only formed in a small region in the top
portion of the cavity, where the mechanically induced convective activities are
appreciable. However, it should be noted that this convective region is decreasing
with increasing Ri.
3.3

Eﬀect of the Darcy Number (Da)

The Da in the present work is varied in the range of 0.0001−0.1 for Ri = 0.0001,
Re = 100. As shown in Fig. 4, the variation of Da signiﬁcantly aﬀects the ﬂow
and temperature ﬁelds. It is obvious that the increase of Da induces ﬂow activity deeper into the cavity, which leads to more energy to be carried away
from the sliding top wall toward bottom, and consequently, the convective region
in the top portion of the cavity is enlarged. However, as Da is decreased to 0.0001,
the primary vortex in the cavity is compelled to move toward left wall and a new

vortex near the bottom corner is formed. In fact, as Da is small enough, the
eﬀect of the nonlinear term in Eq. (2) is prominent, which may induces some
new phenomena as observed in present work. Finally, we would like to point
out that the numerical results derived in this paper qualitatively agree well with
those reported in Ref. [5,6].

Conclusion

In the present work, the problem of mixed convection in a driven cavity ﬁlled
with porous medium is studied with LBM. The inﬂuence of the Reynolds number,
Richardson number and Darcy number on the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds are
investigated in detail. As these parameters are varied in a wide range, some
new phenomena is observed. Through comparisons with the existing literature,
it is found that the LBM can be used as an alternative approach to study this
problem. Compared with traditional numerical methods, LBM oﬀers ﬂexibility,
eﬃciency and outstanding amenability to parallelism when modelling complex
ﬂows, and thus it is more suitable for computation on parallel computers; but to
derive the same accurate results, larger number of grid may be needed. A recent
comparison between LBM and ﬁnite diﬀerent method for simulating natural
convection in porous media can be found in Ref. [14].
