Abstract. In a risk management of derivative securities, Greeks, i.e.
sensitivity coeﬃcients, are important measures of market risk to evaluate the impact of misspeciﬁcation of some stochastic model on the
expected payoﬀ function. We investigate a new computing method for
Greeks based on Malliavin calculus without resort to a direct diﬀerentiation of the complex payoﬀ functions. As a result, a new relation between
Γ and Δ is obtained for the Asian option.
Keywords: Greeks, Malliavin calculus, Monte Carlo simulation.

Introduction

We consider a stochastic integral equation in a well-deﬁned Black-Scholes set-up,
St = S0 +

t
rSτ dτ
0

+

t
σSτ dWτ ,
0

(1)

where St is the price of underlying asset with S0 denoting the present (initial)
value, r denotes the risk-free interest rate, σ is the volatility, and (Wt )0≤t≤T is
a standard Brownian motion. It should be noted that, in European options, we
have a closed solution to (1) as ST = S0 exp(μT + σWT ), where μ = r − σ 2 /2
for a ﬁxed expiration or maturity time T .
We are interested in studying how to evaluate the sensitivity with respect to
model parameters, e.g., present price S0 , volatility σ, etc., of the expected payoﬀ
E[e−rT Φ(ST )],

(2)

for an exponentially discounted value of the payoﬀ function Φ(ST ), where E[·]
denotes the expectation operator. The sensitivity of more sophisticated payoﬀ
functions including path-dependent Asian-type options like
E[e−rT Φ(

be treated in a similar manner along the lines that are investigated in this study.
In ﬁnance, this is the so-called model risk problem. Commonly referred to
as Greeks, sensitivities in ﬁnancial market are typically deﬁned as the partial

derivatives of the expected payoﬀ function with respect to underlying model
parameters. In general, ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations are heavily used to simulate Greeks. However, the approximation soon becomes ineﬃcient particularly
when payoﬀ functions are complex and discontinuous.
To overcome this diﬃculty, Broadie and Glasserman [1] proposed a method
to put the diﬀerential of the payoﬀ function inside the expectation operator
required to evaluate the sensitivity. But this idea is applicable only when the
density of the random variable involved is explicitly known. Recently, Fournie et
al. [2] suggested the use of Malliavin calculus, by means of integration by parts,
to shift the diﬀerential operator from the expected payoﬀ to the underlying
diﬀusion (e.g., Gaussian) kernel, introducing a weighting function.
Another examples that are similar to the present study and explored by the
present author (e.g., Ref. [3], [7]) but not covered in this paper are models
involving a step function and non-smooth objective functions. In these studies,
the stochastic sensitivity analysis technique based on the Novikov’s identity is
used instead of Malliavin calculus.
In this paper, we present a new constructive approach for the computation of
Greeks in ﬁnancial engineering. The present approach enables the simulation of
Greeks without resort to direct diﬀerentiation of the complex or discontinuous
payoﬀ functions.

Malliavin Calculus

Let R be the space of random variables of the form F = f (Wt1 , Wt2 , · · · , Wtn ),
where f is smooth and Wt denotes the Brownian motion [6]. For a smooth
random variable F ∈ R, we can deﬁne its derivative DF = Dt F , where the
diﬀerential operator D is closable. Since D operates on random variables by
diﬀerentiating functions in the form of partial derivatives, it shares the familiar
chain rule property, Dt (f (F )) = ∇f (F ) · Dt F = f (F )Dt F , and others.
We denote by D∗ the Skorohod integral, deﬁned as the adjoint operator of D.
If u belongs to Dom(D∗ ), then D∗ (u) is characterized by the following integration
by parts (ibp) formula:
E[F D∗ (u)] = E[

T
(Dt F )ut dt].
0

(4)

Note that (4) gives a duality relationship to link operators D and D∗ . The
adjoint operator D∗ behaves like a stochastic integral. In fact, if ut is an adapted
process, then the Skorohod integral coincides with the Ito integral: i.e., D∗ (u) =
T
ut dWt . In general, one has
0
D∗ (F u) = F D∗ (u) −

T
(Dt F )ut dt.
0

(5)

A heuristic derivation of (5) is demonstrated here. Let us assume that F and G
are any two smooth random variables, and ut a generic process, then by product
rule of D one has

E[GF D∗ (u)] = E[

= E[

0 G(Dt F )ut dt]
∗

+ E[

T
0 (Dt G)F ut dt]

+ E[GD (F u)],

T

which implies that E[GD∗ (F u)] = E[G(F D∗ (u) − 0 (Dt F )ut dt)] for any
random variables G. Hence, we must have (5).
In the present study, we frequently use the following formal relationship to
remove the derivative from a (smooth) random function f as follows:
E[∇f (X)Y ] = E[f (X)Y ] = E[f (X)HXY ],

(6)

where X, Y , and HXY are random variables. It is noted that (6) can be deduced
from the integration by parts formula (4), and we have an explicit expression for
HXY as
Y
.

HXY = D∗

If higher order derivatives are involved then one has to repeat the procedure (6)
iteratively.

European Options

In the case of European option whose payoﬀ function is deﬁned by (2), the essence
of the present method is that the gradient of the expected (discounted) payoﬀ,
∇E[e−rT Φ(ST )], is evaluated by putting the gradient inside the expectation, i.e.,
E[e−rT ∇Φ(ST )], which involves computations of ∇Φ(ST ) = Φ (ST ) and ∇ST .
Further, applying Malliavin calculus techniques, the gradient is rewritten as
E[e−rT Φ(ST )H] for some random variable H. It should be noted, however, that
there is no uniqueness in this representation since we can add to H any random
variables that are orthogonal to ST . In general, H involves Ito or Skorohod
integrals.
3.1

Delta

Now we compute Delta, Δ, the ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential sensitivity coeﬃcient of the expected outcome of the option, i.e., (2), with respect to the initial
asset value S0 :

Then, utilizing (6) and (7) again with X = ST and Y = ST (WT − σT ), we apply
the ibp to give

Since we have closed solutions for all the Greeks in European options, we can
easily check the correctness of the above results.

Asian Options

In the case of Asian option whose payoﬀ functional is deﬁned by (3), the essence
of the present approach is again that the gradient of the expected (discounted)
T

payoﬀ is rewritten as E[e−rT ∇Φ( T1 0 St dt)] = e−rT E[Φ( T1 0 St dt)H], for some
random variable H. Diﬀerent from the European options, however, we do not
have a known closed solution in this case.

Monte Carlo Simulations of Asian Option

Here, we present the simulation results with parameters r = 0.1, σ = 0.25,
T = 0.2 (in years), and S0 = K = 100 (in arbitrary cash units) where K denotes
the strike price. We have divided the entire interval of integration into 252 pieces,
representing the trading days in a year.
In Fig. 1, we compare the convergence behavior of Δ with the result obtained
by Broadie and Glasserman [1]. The result indicates a fairy good convergence to
the steady-state value that is attained at 10, 000th iteration stage in [1].
In Fig. 2, we compare the simulation result of V with the one that is obtained at 10, 000th iteration stage in [1]. This indicates that some noticeable
bias may remain in the present Monte Carlo simulation, and further study may
be necessary to analyze and reduce the bias involved.
Although we cannot compare the proposed method with others, the present
simulations may provide most detailed and extensive results currently available
for Greeks of Asian option.

Conclusions

We have presented a stochastic sensitivity analysis method, in particular, a constructive approach for computing Greeks in ﬁnance using Malliavin calculus. As
a result, a new relation between Γ and Δ is obtained for the Asian option. The
present approach may be useful when the random variables are smooth in the
sense of stochastic derivatives. It is, however, necessary to further investigate and
improve Monte Carlo procedures to reduce the bias involved in the simulation
of Vega in Asian-type options and other sophisticated options.
