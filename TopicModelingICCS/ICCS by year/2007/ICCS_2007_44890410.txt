Abstract. In this paper, we consider whether the vertices of graph G
can be partitioned into K subsets V1 , V2 , ... VK so that for each i ∈
{1,. . . ,K}, the subgraph induced by Vi is a perfect matching where K ≤
|V |. It is known that it is an NP complete problem in general graphs. In
this paper, we restrict the problem in Halin graphs and give an algorithm
to ﬁnd the minimum value of K (2 ≤ K ≤ 4) in Halin graphs. The time
complexity is O(n).
Keywords: Halin Graph, Perfect matching, Algorithm.

Introduction and Terminology

Let M be a matching of graph G and v ∈ V (G). If v is incident with an edge
in M , v is called M -saturated. If every vertex of G is M -saturated, then M is a
perfect matching of G. If edges in graph G share a common vertex or adjacent
to a same edge, these edges are said to be connected. A perfect matching M in
G is called k-colored if at least k colors are used to color the edges in M such
that any two connected edges in M have diﬀerent colors, and k is called the
chromatic number of M . If the minimum chromatic number of all the perfect
matchings in graph G is k, G is called k perfect matching colored (PMC).
A Halin graph H = T ∪ C is obtained by embedding a tree T having no nodes
of degree 2 in the plane, and then add a cycle C to join the leaves of T in such
a way that the resulting graph is planar. If T is a star, that is, a single vertex
joining to the other vertices, then H = T ∪ C is called a wheel. Suppose T has
at least two non-leaves. Let w be a non-leaf of T which is adjacent to only one
non-leaf of T . Then the set of leaves of T adjacent to w, which we denote by
C(w), comprises a consecutive subsequence of the cycle C. We call the subgraph
of H induced by {w} ∪ C(w) a fan and call w the center of the fan. An edge
cutset of a connected graph G = (V, E) is a set of edges whose removal leaves
a disconnected graph. If it consists of exactly k edges, then we call it a k-edge
cutset. Given a fan F of H, the three edges connecting V (F ) to V (H − F )
compose a 3-edge cutset of H. We denote the 3-edge cutest by EC 3 (F ).
In the following sections, we use H = T ∪ C to denote a Halin graph and K
to denote the minimum integer satisfying that V (H) can be partitioned into K
sets, say V1 , ..., VK , such that H[Vi ] is a perfect matching for all i ∈ {1, . . . , K}.

Main Results

Theorem 1. Let H and K be as deﬁned as above. And H has even order. Then
2 ≤ K ≤ 4.
Proof. Halin graphs have hamilton cycles and if any node is deleted, the resulting
graph still has a hamilton cycle [2]. So H has a perfect matching. Assume M
is a perfect matching in H. Let H be a graph by contracting each edges in
M . Let e(v) be the edge in M such that v is the vertex constructed in H
after contracting e(v). Obviously H is planar, so by Lemma 1, H is 4-colored.
Assume 1, 2, 3, 4 are the four colors used to color H , Wi are all the vertices
in H which are colored color i and Ui = {e(v): v ∈ Wi } where 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. Let
e(v1 ) and e(v2 ) be any two edges in Ui , then v1 , v2 ∈ Wi . Then e(v1 ) and e(v2 )
are not connected, otherwise v1 and v2 have diﬀerent colors, contradicting v1 ,
v2 ∈ Wi . So let Ti ={v: v ∈ V (e) and e ∈ Ui } where 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 and then H[Ti ]
is a matching in H. Since ∪4i=1 Ui = M , then ∪4i=1 Ti = V (H). So K ≤ 4. K can
not be 1. So 2 ≤ K ≤ 4.
Theorem 2. K = k if and only if H is k PMC.
Proof. Suppose K=k. Assume H is k PMC. Then the vertices of a Halin graph
H can be partitioned into k subsets, say V1 , V2 , . . . ,Vk , such that the subgraph
induced by Vi is a perfect matching, say Mi , where 1 ≤ i ≤ k. So M = M1 ∪
M2 ∪. . . ∪Mk is a perfect matching in H. Obviously, M is k-colored because if
edges in Mi are colored with a same color ci where 1 ≤ i ≤ k and cx = cy (if
x = y and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ k), then no adjacent edges in M have a same color. So
k ≤ k. Suppose k < k. Then there is a perfect matching M in H such that
M is k -colored. Let Mi be all the edges in M that have one same color where
1 ≤ i ≤ k . Then V (V1 )∪V (V2 )∪. . . ∪V (Vk )=V (H), H[V1 ]=M1 , H[V2 ]=M2
. . . and H[Vk ]=Mk . The subgraph induced by Vi is a perfect matching, so k ≤ k .
A contradiction with k < k. That is k = k, H is k PMC.
Now we prove suﬃciency. If H is k PMC, then there exists a perfect matching,
say M , such that M is k-colored. Let Mi are all edges in M that have one same
color where 1 ≤ i ≤ k. V1 = V (M1 ), V2 = V (M2 ) . . . and Vk = V (Mk ). Then
V (V1 ) ∪ V (V2 )∪. . . ∪V (Vk ) = V (H). The subgraph induced by Vi is a perfect
matching, so K ≤ k. Suppose K < k, Then the vertices of a Halin graph H can be
partitioned into K subsets, say V1 , V2 , . . . , VK , such that the subgraph induced
by Vi is a perfect matching, say Mi , where 1 ≤ i ≤ K. So M = M1 ∪M2 ∪. . . ∪MK
is a perfect matching in H. Hence M is K-colored, so k ≤ K. A contradiction
with K < k. That is K = k. So K = k if and only if H is k PMC.
Since all the vertices in Vi are colored with the same colors, an edge coloring
about the Halin graph H is obtained. It obeys that the colored edges must

cover all the vertices of H and if two edges are connected, they are colored with
diﬀerent colors. So we convert the problem to the edge coloring in Halin graphs.

Description of the Algorithm

Firstly we brieﬂy describe the method of shrinking fan ﬁrstly appeared in [3].
Let F be a fan. We use H × F to denote the graph obtained from H by shrinking
F to a new “pseudo-vertex”, say vF ; that is, V (H × F ) = {vF } ∪ {V (H)\V (F )}
and the edges of H × F are deﬁned as follows:
1. An edge with both ends in F is deleted;
2. An edge with both ends in H − F remains unchanged;
3. An edge with one end-vertex in H − F and the other in F now joins the
incident vertex of H − F and vF .
By Theorem 1, K is 2, 3 or 4. Firstly we check whether K = 2. If K = 2,
check whether K = 3. If K = 3, K = 4. We discuss it in the following two cases.
4.1

Case 1: Check Whether K = 2

By Theorem 2, in order to check whether K = 2, we only need to check whether
there is a perfect matching in H which is 2-colored. Let F be a fan of H, M be
a perfect matching of H and EC 3 (F ) = {k, j, l}. Let k = uk vk , j = uj vj and
l = ul vl such that uk , uj , ul ∈ V (F ), vk , vj , vl ∈ V (H − F ), j, l ∈ C and the
direction vj , uj , ul , vl is anti-clockwise in the cycle C.
Since M is a perfect matching of H, each vertex of H is saturated by M .
If k ∈ M , we say the vertex uk is externally saturated in F ; otherwise, internally. The denotations are the same to uj and ul . Only the situation of {uk ,
uj , ul } aﬀects the situation of M ∩ (H − F ). In the following we use Pos(v) to
denote whether the vertex v is internally or externally colored where Pos(v) ∈
{externally, internally}, Color (v) to denote which color vertex v is colored where
Color (v) ∈ {c1 , c2 }, and X(v) to denote the coloring state of vertex v. We deﬁne
the following four situations respectively:
X(v) = 1
X(v) = 2
X(v) = 3
X(v) = 4

internally and Color (v) = c1 ;
externally and Color (v) = c1 ;
internally and Color (v) = c2 ;
externally and Color (v) = c2 ;

We use a triple (X(uk ), X(uj ), X(ul )) to denote one situation of uk , uj , ul .
And T (F ) is a set of all the triples to F in all the colorings . After shrinking a
fan F to a pseudo vertex vF , we set T (vF ) = T (F ).
We regard an original vertex on the cycle C as a special fan. Let C be the
cycle of H and u be an original vertex on C. Let j = uvj , l = uvl and k =
uvk such that vj , vl ∈ V (C), vk ∈ V (H − C) and the direction of vj , u, vl
is anti-clockwise in the cycle C. If k ∈ M , we say the vertex u is externally

saturated and use a triple (X(u), 0, 0) where X(u) = 2 or 4 to denote a possible
situation. If j ∈ M , we use a triple (0, X(u), 0) to denote this situation. If
l ∈ M , similarly. So for each leaf v in H, we relate v with a set of triples
T (v) = {(2, 0, 0), (4, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 4, 0), (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 4)}.
Now we describe how to get all the triples in a certain fan F . Dynamic programming is used here. Let F be a fan of H. Let wc be the center of F and
w1 , w2 . . . wr be the vertices on the cycle C in anti-clockwise order. Each wi
(1 ≤ i ≤ r) can be either an original vertex or a pseudo-vertex. We denote the
induced subgraph H[{wc , w1 , w2 , . . . , wk }] by pseudo-fan PF k of F (2 ≤ k ≤ r).
Note that if wc wi ∈ M (k + 1 ≤ i ≤ r), then vertex wc is said to be externally
saturated according to the pseudo-fan PF k in M . Hence T (PF i ) is a set of all
the triples to the pseudo-fan PF i . We calculate the situation of k = 2 ﬁrst.
T (PF 2 ) = {t1 • s1 | t1 • s1 = N U LL and t1 ∈ T (w1 ) and s1 ∈ T (w2 )}.
Let y, z ∈{1, 2, 3, 4}. t1 • s1 = N U LL except the following situations:
(2,y,1)•(3,3,z)=(1,y,z), (2,y,3)•(3,1,z)=(1,y,z), (2,y,2)•(3,2,z)=(1,y,z)
(2,y,4)•(3,4,z)=(1,y,z), (3,y,1)•(2,3,z)=(1,y,z), (3,y,3)•(2,1,z)=(1,y,z)
(3,y,2)•(2,2,z)=(1,y,z), (3,y,4)•(2,4,z)=(1,y,z), (2,0,0)•(0,0,4)=(1,1,4)
(0,4,0)•(2,0,0)=(1,4,1), (2,0,0)•(3,3,z)=(1,1,z), (3,y,3)•(2,0,0)=(1,y,1)
(3,y,1)•(3,3,z)=(2,y,z), (3,y,3)•(3,1,z)=(2,y,z), (3,y,2)•(3,2,z)=(2,y,z)

(1,y,3)•(0,0,2)=(4,y,2), (1,y,2)•(0,2,0)=(4,y,1), (0,0,2)•(0,2,0)=(4,1,1)
Suppose w1 , w2 are pseudo vertices. Let uc (the center), u1 , u2 . . . ur be all
the vertices in H after restoring the pseudo vertex in w1 and uc (the center),
u1 , u2 . . . ur be all the vertices in H after restoring the pseudo vertex in w2 . If
(X(uc ), X(u1 ), X(ur )) = (2, y, 4) and (X(uc ), X(u1 ), X(ur )) = (3, 4, z), then

the triple (X(wc ), X(w1 ), X(w2 )) in T (PF 2 ) equals (1, y, z), that is (2, y, 4)•(3,
4, z) = (1, y, z). See Fig.1 (The left).
Once we have the set T (PF i ), we can calculate T (PF i+1 ).
T (PF i+1 ) = {t1 • s1 | t1 • s1 = N U LL and t1 ∈ T (PF i ) and s1 ∈ T (wi+1 )}
(2≤ i ≤ r-1), Similarly, we present the formulas to the calculation as following:
t1 • s1 = N U LL except the following situations:
(1,y,1)•(3,3,z)=(1,y,z), (1,y,3)•(3,1,z)=(1,y,z), (1,y,2)•(3,2,z)=(1,y,z)
(1,y,4)•(3,4,z)=(1,y,z), (1,y,1)•(0,0,4)=(1,y,4), (1,y,4)•(0,4,0)=(1,y,3)
(3,y,3)•(1,1,z)=(3,y,z), (3,y,1)•(1,3,z)=(3,y,z), (3,y,4)•(1,4,z)=(3,y,z)
(3,y,2)•(1,2,z)=(3,y,z), (3,y,3)•(0,0,2)=(3,y,2), (3,y,2)•(0,2,0)=(3,y,1)
(2,y,1)•(2,3,z)=(1,y,z), (2,y,3)•(2,1,z)=(1,y,z), (2,y,2)•(2,2,z)=(1,y,z)
(2,y,4)•(2,4,z)=(1,y,z), (2,y,3)•(2,0,0)=(1,y,1)
(4,y,3)•(4,1,z)=(3,y,z), (4,y,1)•(4,3,z)=(3,y,z), (4,y,4)•(4,4,z)=(3,y,z)
(4,y,2)•(4,2,z)=(3,y,z), (4,y,1)•(4,0,0)=(3,y,3)
(2,y,1)•(3,3,z)=(2,y,z), (2,y,3)•(3,1,z)=(2,y,z), (2,y,2)•(3,2,z)=(2,y,z)
(2,y,4)•(3,4,z)=(2,y,z), (2,y,1)•(0,0,4)=(2,y,4), (2,y,4)•(0,4,0)=(2,y,3)
(4,y,3)•(1,1,z)=(4,y,z), (4,y,1)•(1,3,z)=(4,y,z), (4,y,4)•(1,4,z)=(4,y,z)
(4,y,2)•(1,2,z)=(4,y,z), (4,y,3)•(0,0,2)=(4,y,2), (4,y,2)•(0,2,0)=(4,y,3)
Once the set T (PF r ) is obtained, we can calculate T (F ) = T (PFr ).
Suppose wi+1 is a pseudo vertex. Let uc (the center), u1 , u2 . . . ur be all the
vertices in H after restoring the pseudo vertex in wi+1 . If one triple in T (PF i )
is (X(wc ), X(w1 ), X(wi )) = (2, y, 1) and (X(uc ), X(u1 ), X(ur )) = (2, 3, z),
then the triple (X(wc ), X(w1 ), X(wi+1 )) in T (PF i+1 ) equals (1, y, z), that is
(2, y, 1)•(2, 3, z) = (1, y, z). See Fig.1 (The right).
Firstly, our algorithm picks a non-leaf vertex r as the root of T such that r is
adjacent to a leaf f of T and perform a postorder scan of T . When a vertex is
scanned there are three possibilities: (I) v is a leaf, it is simply bypassed, (II) v
is a non-leaf diﬀerent from r, v and all its children constitute a fan F . We shrink
F to vF and get T (F ). Let T (vF ) = T (F ), (III) v = r, then H has been reduced
to a wheel. Let F ≡ H − f . We consider F as a fan and shrink F to a pseudo
vertex r and get T (r ) = T (PFk−1 ), then H is reduced to a graph as Fig.2.

Fig. 2. The graph after shrinking all fans in H

T (r ) and T (f ) can match if and only if there is a triple (x, y, z) in T (r ) and
a triple (x , y , z ) in T (f ) such that they can match in a legal 2 coloring, that
is, they satisfy the following conditions:
(1) If x = 2, then x = 2, y = z = 3 else if x = 4, x = 4, y = z = 1.
(2) If y = 2, then z = 2, x = y = 3 else if y = 4, z = 4, x = y = 1.
(3) If z = 2, then y = 2, x = z = 3 else if z = 4, y = 4, x = z = 1.

Theorem 3. Let r be the vertex after applying the shrinking operations on
fans in H recursively and T (r ), T (f ) as deﬁned above. Then T (r ) and T (f )
can match if and only if H is 2 PMC.
Proof. To prove this theorem, it is suﬃcient to prove the following claim.
Claim. Let H be a Halin graph and F be a fan in H. Let wc be the center of F
and let w1 , w2 . . . wr for r ≥ 2 be the vertices of F belong to C. T (PF i ) includes
all the possible triples in a pseudo fan PF i where 2 ≤ i ≤ r.
Proof. It is suﬃcient to prove T (PF i ) includes all the possible triples in a pseudo
fan PF i where 2 ≤ i ≤ r. We use induction on i.
(1)When i = 2, the table T (PF 2 ) includes all the possible triples according to
T (w1 ) and T (w2 ).
(2)When i < m, suppose Claim holds.
(3)When i = m, suppose T (PF i ) does not include all the possible triples, that
is there exits one triple (X(wc ), X(w1 ), X(wi )) is not in T (PF i ), but (X(wc ),
X(w1 ), X(wi )) is one situation of wc , w1 , wi in a fan PF i actually.
(3.1) If wi is an original vertex
(3.1.1) (x, 0, 0) ∈ T (wi ), x ∈ {2, 4}.
By the structure of T (PF m−1 ), we know it must include the triple (X(wc ) ,
X(w1 ), X(wi−1 )) such that X(wi−1 ) MOD 2 = 1, X(wi−1 ) = X(wi ), X(wc ) = x
and X(wc ) = X(wi ) + 1. Then after (X(wc ) , X(w1 ), X(wi−1 ))•(x, 0, 0) we
can get the triple (X(wc ), X(w1 ), X(wi )) in T (PF i ). A contradiction.
(3.1.2) (0, y, 0) ∈ T (wi ), y ∈ {2, 4}. Similarly.
(3.1.3) (0, 0, z) ∈ T (wi ), z ∈ {2, 4}. Similarly.
(3.2) If wi is a pseudo-vertex. Suppose we get wi after shrinking F , let v0 be the
center of F and v1 , v2 . . . vm be the vertices on the cycle C in that order. ∀ (x,
y, z) ∈ T (wi ), (x, y, z) is equal to (X(v0 ), X(v1 ), X(vm )),x, y, z ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}
(3.2.1) If Pos(v0 ) = externally and Pos(v1 ) = externally
By the structure of T (PF m−1 ), it must include one triple (X(wc ) , X(w1 ),
X(wi−1 )) such that X(wc ) = X(wc ) + 1 = X(v0 ) and X(wi−1 ) = X(v1 ). Then
after (X(wc ) , X(w1 ), X(wi−1 ))•(x, y, z) we can get the triple (X(wc ), X(w1 ),
X(wi )) in T (PF i ). A contradiction.
(3.2.2) If Pos(v0 ) = externally and Pos(v1 ) = internally. Similarly.
(3.2.3) If Pos(v0 ) = internally and Pos(v1 ) = externally. Similarly.
(3.2.4) If Pos(v0 ) = internally and Pos(v1 ) = internally. Similarly.
So when i = m, T (PFi ) = T (F ) includes all the possible triples.
After applying shrinking operations recursively, H is reduced to the graph in
Fig.2. Let V1 = {all vertices in H after restoring each pseudo vertex in r }, V2 =
{f }, {e1 , e2 , e3 } are the three edges joining V1 to V2 , H1 and H2 are subgraphs
constructed by adding {e1 , e2 , e3 } to subgraphs H[V1 ] and H[V2 ] respectively.
Then each t ∈ T (r ) corresponds a legal 2 coloring of a matching in H1 covering
all the vertices in V1 and so does each s ∈ T (f ). By Claim, T (r ) contains all
the possible coloring situations in H1 and T (f ) contains all the possible coloring
situations in H2 . Then by deﬁnition T (r ) and T (f ) can match if and only if

416

Y. Lu and D. Lou

there exists a triple t in T (r ) and a triple s in T (f ) such that the coloring in H1
that t corresponds and the coloring in H2 that s corresponds can match together
in a legal 2 coloring of H. So if T (r ) and T (f ) can match, H is 2 PMC.
Now we prove suﬃciency. Suppose H is 2 PMC, there must exist C which is a
legal 2 coloring of H. C contains a legal 2-coloring C1 of H1 and a legal 2-coloring
C2 of H2 . By Claim, C1 corresponds a triple t in T (r ) and C2 corresponds a
triple s in T (f ). Hence t and s can match together in a legal 2 perfect matching
coloring of H. By deﬁnition, T (r ) and T (f ) can match. Thus the Theorem holds.

The Correctness and the Time Complexity

Theorem 4. The algorithm K(H) returns K.
Proof. The algorithm ﬁrstly checks whether K equals 2. In step 2), it ﬁnds a
fan F . In step 3), it returns all the possible triples to F by Theorem 3. After
applying shrinking operations repeatedly, H is reduced to a graph as Fig.2. In
the algorithm, if T (r ) and T (f ) can match, it returns 2. So it returns the right
K by Theorem 3. If they cannot match, the algorithm checks whether K equals
3 from 9)-14). Similar to Case 1, if T (r ) and T (f ) can match, it returns 3.
Otherwise, K(H) returns 4.
In the algorithm, step 1) needs O(1) time. Step 3) is the operation of shrinking
fans in H. If a fan F contains r+1 vertices, then it is veriﬁed that the time of
the shrinking operation is O(r). Moreover, shrinking F reduces the number of
vertices of the graph by r. Thus, the total time of the shrinking operation is
O(|V |). The time of the postorder scan without shrinking is bounded by O(|V |).
The steps 4)-7) need O(1) time. The time of steps 9)-14) is the same as the steps
2)-7). Therefore, the total time for this algorithm is O(|V |).
