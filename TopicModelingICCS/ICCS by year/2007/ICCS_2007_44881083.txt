Abstract. Taking the approximate equations for long waves in shallow water as
example, the quasi-wavelet discrete scheme is proposed for obtaining numerical
solution of the (1+1) dimension nonlinear partial differential equation. In the
method, the quasi-wavelet discrete scheme is adopted to discretize the spatial
derivative discrete and the ordinary differential equation about time is obtained.
Then the fourth order Rung-Katta method is employed to discretize the temporal derivative. Finally the quasi-wavelet solution is compared with the analytical
solution, and the computations are validated.
Keywords: interval quasi_shannon; precise integration method; approximate
equations of long waves in shallow water.

1 Introduction
In recent years, many methods have been developed for the analytical solution to
nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). For example, important such ones as
homogeneous balance method, variable separable methods and Jacobi elliptic function expansion are used to solve PDE exact solution and solitary wave solution[1-5].
But in general, it is quite difficult to carry on a deep study to the wellposedness of the
solutions. Wavelet function is the energy function with locality characterization, and
it is characterized by utilizing information from the nearest neighboring grid pints to
approximate the differentiation at a point, and thus is much more flexible. The wavelet method is applied to numerical solution of PDE by Morlet J, Arens G, Fourgeau E,
et al. Its applications have become one of the fastest growing research areas. The

Daubechies scaling function constructs the grid point method of wavelet to solve PDE
by [6]. Daubechies scaling function converges slowly with respect to mesh refinement
and is not cost-effective for achieving high precision. Hence, there is a strong demand
for a scheme, which can solve the numerical solutions of nonlinear partial differential
equations. The scaling function of Shannon’s wavelet is represented in an analytical
form. When Shannon scaling is multiplied by Gauss function[7], a function, quasi
scaling function will be obtained. The wavelet of orthogonal function when it is further generalized is called quasi-wavelet. While high-accuracy solution of numerical is
very useful to nonlinear PDEs when it functions as a local method.
The numerical solution of PDE is solved by method of quasi-wavelet in [8]. However, research of application of quasi-wavelet to numerical solutions of nonlinear
PDEs has not been conducted, for example (1+1) dimensional models such as the
approximate equations for long waves in shallow water have not been studied. This
paper uses the quasi-wavelet method to construct scaling function. In the method the
quasi-wavelet discrete scheme is adopted to discretize the spatial derivatives, and the
fourth order Rung-Katta method is adopted to discretize the temporal derivatives. The
numerical solution of example showed that quasi-wavelet method is a success in computation of the nonlinear PDEs solutions, and the method is helpful to improve the
precision of the solutions. In the end, the computation results are validated based on
the numerical solutions of the quasi-wavelet and the analytical solutions.

2.2 Numerical Discrete Forms of Quasi-wavelet Spatial Coordinate Discrete to
the Long Waves in Shallow Water
To solve Eq.(9)-(10), the regularized Shannon’s delta kernel is used, which can dramatically increase the regularity of Shannon’s wavelet scaling function,[or quasiscaling function][8].
δ Δ， σ ( x ) =

sin(π x / Δ )
exp[ − x 2 / 2σ 2 ]
πx/Δ

(11)

where Δ is the grid spacing, σ is determines the width of the Gauss envelop and can
be varied in association with the grid space. i.e., σ = rΔ and r ≥ 2 / π r is the
parameter. The regularized Shannon’s wavelet is called quasi-wavelet. Shannon’s
scaling function is recognized as basis function, the function f ( x ) and g ( x ) in the
interval ⎡ π π ⎤ can be expressed as

In discrete singular convolution algorithm, the band-limits f (x ) , g ( x ) and its derivatives with respect to the coordinate at grid point x are approximated by linear sun

In fact, the 2w point of computation is obtained in the coordinate around a grid
point {xi } ; 2w+1 is the total computational bandwidth, which is usually much smaller
than the computational domain. Eq.(15)-(16) are called quasi-wavelet form of numerical discrete.

2.3 Temporal Derivatives Discretization
A Rung-Kutta schema is used for temporal derivatives. The ordinary differential
Eqs. (9)-(10) are used by fourth-order Rung-Katta method to discretize temporal
derivatives, which can be expressed as follows

uin +1 = uin +

Δt
[ K i ,1 + 2 K i ,2 + 2 K i ,3 + K i ,4 ]

(i = 1,2, 3,......N = 1 )

(16)

where

K i ,1 = f i ,1n

v nj =1 = v nj +

L j ,1 = g nj ,1

K i ,2 = f i ,2n

K i ,3 = f i ,3n

K i ,4 = f i ,4n

(i= 1, 2, ...,N+1)

Δt

L j ,2 = g nj ,2 L j ,3 = g nj ,3 L j ,4 = g nj ,4 (j=1, 2,...,N+1)

Where upper sign n is time level, Δ t is length of time.
From Eq.(16),we have
