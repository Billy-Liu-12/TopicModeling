Abstract. Web usage mining (WUM) is an important and fast developing area
of web mining. Recently, some enterprises have been aware of its potentials,
especially for applications in Business Intelligence (BI) and Customer
Relationship Management (CRM). Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the
behaviors and characteristics of web user so as to use this knowledge for
advertising, targeted marketing, increasing competition ability, etc. This paper
provides an analytic method, algorithm and procedure based on suggestions
from literature and the authors‚Äô experiences from some practical web mining
projects. Its application shows combined use of frequent sequence patterns
(FSP) discovery and the characteristic analysis of user clusters can contribute to
improve and optimize marketing and CRM.
Keywords: WUM, FSP, clustering.

1 Introduction
Data mining has been used by many organizations to extract the valuable information
from large volumes of data and then use them to make critical business decisions. As
for WUM, a lot of work mainly focus on web user navigating patterns discovery and
association analysis, user and web pages clustering. However, it is insufficient in
analyzing the characteristics of web clusters after identifying interesting frequent
browsing patterns. In this paper, firstly we introduce related work in WUM and its
analytic steps. And then, we discuss the three main steps in WUM, taking an
educational web server for example. Here our main work lies in creating a data mart
of web usage data, discovering some FSP of web user, providing a method that
measures the similarities among different FSP for user clusters, and providing an
algorithm and its applications. In the end, a comparison between this algorithm and kmeans, Kohonen is given.

2.1 Taxonomy of Web Mining
Web mining involves a wide range of applications that aims at discovering and
extracting hidden information in data stored on the Web. Besieds, Web mining can be
categorized into three different classes: (i) Web content mining, (ii) Web structure
mining and (iii) WUM. For detailed surveys of Web mining please refer to [1].
Respectively, Web content mining [1] is the task of discovering useful information
available on-line. Web structure mining [1, 2, 3] is the process of discovering the
structure of hyperlinks within the Web. WUM is the task of discovering the activities
of the users while they are browsing and navigating through the Web [1].
2.2 WUM
WUM, from the data mining aspect, is the task of applying data mining techniques to
discover usage patterns from Web data in order to understand and better serve the
needs of users navigating on the Web [1]. As every data mining task, the process of
WUM also consists of three main steps: (i) data selecting and preprocessing, (ii)
pattern discovery and (iii) pattern analysis.

3 Data Selecting and Preprocessing
After we set up a definite business target, it is necessary to extract and select the types
of data from data sources. In general, in WUM we may gain the following three types
of data: (i) web data: generated by visits to a web site; (ii) business data: produced by
the respective OLTP, OLAP, DSS and other systems; (iii) meta data, data describing
the web site itself , for example, content and structure, etc.
Just as the discussion above, Web log data can mainly get from the internet or
intranet resources. In this paper, web log files are from DePaul CTI Web server log.
The preprocessed and filtered data is based on a random sample of users visiting this
site for a 2 week period which contains 13745 sessions and 683 page views from 5446
users. To analyze, we have developed a data mart to support FSP mining and further
the characteristics analysis of user clusters. The data model is reported in Figure1.

4 Frequent Patterns Discovery
4.1 FSP Discovery
In this section, we use the notion of FSP discovery where temporal correlations
among items in user transactions are discovered.
4.2 Results of Experimentation
In this paper we employ FSP discovery to the above dataset and produce these results
in Fig.2 with maximum length be 3 and the top 3 of these FSP numbered 3514.

5 The Characteristics Analysis of Web User Clusters
5.1 Similarity Measures
Given a weighted value set W of the pages in the k ‚àí th length FSP fpi , and thus, the
similarity between the FSP fpi and fp j is defined as:
k
‚éß1 if the two pages is same
sim( fpi , fp j ) = ‚àë wl * eq ( pil , p jl ) , eq ( pil , p jl ) = ‚é®
.
l =1
‚é©0 otherwise

Here eq (*,*) may be the combined probability distribution function of the fpi and fp j .
5.2 Algorithm

In this part, we give an algorithm which implement maximum spanning tree (MST)
clustering based on the above FSP (MSTCBFSP), as the following:
Input: FP = { fp1 , fp2 , " , fpm } , W = {w1 , w2 , " , wk } , Œ≥ . Output: T // Set of clusters.
Processing Flow: // MST clustering based on FSP.

Step one: Compute the similarity of the different FSP and construct a graph G .
Step two: Building a MST Tmax on graph G .
Step three: Clustering analysis according to the MST Tmax .

6 Comparison of the Results and Conclusions
We use the MSTCBFSP could promptly find a global optimum solution and randomshaped clusters. In contrast, k-means is apt to find a local optimum solution and it
does not work on categorical data directly and can only find convex-shaped clusters.
Besides, for Kohonen map, the explanation of clustering results is very difficult. In
conclusion, the MSTCBFSP is a better method. Consequently, we may try to use the
fuzzy MSTCBFSP in the future.
