Abstract. At present, qualitative spatial reasoning has become the hot
issues in many research ﬁelds. The most popular models of spatial topological relations are Region Connection Calculus (RCC) and 9-intersection model. However, there are few contributions on topological
relations of concave regions in which the representative model is Cohn’s
RCC23. There are some limitations of RCC23 especially in practical applications due to its less expressiveness. In order to construct a more
expressive model of topological relations between concave regions, this
paper completed the following works: 9-intersection matrix is extended
to 16-intersection matrix, and RCC23 is reﬁned to RCC62 based on 16intersection matrix. More relations can be distinguished in RCC62, which
is more expressive than RCC23. In order to further reason about relations in RCC62, the Conceptual Neighborhood Graph (CNG) and the
Closest Topological Relation Graph (CTRG) of RCC62 are given.
Keywords: topological relation, simple concave region, 9-intersection
model, 16-intersection matrix, RCC23.

Introduction

The development of formal models on spatial relations is an essential topic in spatial reasoning, geographic information system (GIS) and computer vision which
got much attention from researchers in relative ﬁelds during recent years [1], [2],
[3]. Particularly, signiﬁcant progresses have been made in models on topological
spatial relations of regions. Topology is perhaps the most basic aspect of space.
It is clear that topology must form a fundamental aspect of qualitative spatial
reasoning since topology certainly can only make qualitative distinctions [3].
At present, most of the models on topological spatial relations adopt either
logical or algebraic methods, among which the most typical models are Region
Connection Calculus (RCC) [4] and intersection models [5]. Moreover, there are
many improved methods proposed by other researchers. Most of the existing
models mainly concentrate on topological relations between convex regions [4],
[5], but less works have been made on topological relations between concave

regions, in which one of the typical models is Cohn’s RCC23 [6], which twentythree topological relations between two simple concave regions are deﬁned based
on two primitive of connection and convex hull. However, there are limitations
of RCC23 especially in spatial query on account of its less expressiveness. Sometimes, the querying results would be inexact or the querying request may be
failed. Thus, it is essential to establish more expressive models for topological
relations between concave regions.
This paper make an extension of 9-intersection to 16-intersection matrix, and
based on 16-intersection matrix, RCC23 [6] is reﬁned to a set of sixty-two relations, thus derived RCC62 which is more expressive than RCC23. In order to
further research the reasoning of RCC62, the Conceptual Neighborhood Graph
(CNG) [7] and the Closest Topological Relation Graph (CTRG) [8] of RCC62
are given.

Background

2.1

RCC8 and RCC23

Randell et al. [4] proposed the RCC theory based on a calculus of individuals
developed by Clarke. The basic part of RCC theory assumes a primitive dyadic
relation: C(x, y) read as ‘x connects with y’ which is deﬁned on regions. Using
the relation C(x, y), a basic set of dyadic relations are deﬁned: DC, EC, PO,
TPP, NTPP, TPPi, NTPPi, EQ. To reason about spatial change, the Conceptual
Neighborhood Graph (CNG) [7] is used. Fig. 1(left) shows the basic relations
and also the CNG of RCC8 which indicates the continuous transitions among
the RCC8 relations.
Cohn et al. [6] deﬁned three predicates (INSIDE, P-INSIDE, and OUTSIDE)
based on the primitive of convex hull to test for a region being inside, partly
inside and outside another. Each of these relations is asymmetric so they have
inverses, denoted by INSIDEi, P-INSIDEi and OUTSIDEi. The deﬁnitions naturally give rise to a set of twenty-three JEPD relations, which we call RCC23,
as illustrated in Fig. 1 (right).

Intersection Models

Egenhofer et al. [5] presented the 9-intersection model for binary topological relations between crisp regions by comparing the interiors (A◦ ), boundaries (∂A)
and exteriors (A− ) of the two regions. Considering the binary values empty and
non-empty for these intersections, one can distinguish 512 binary topological
relationships. Eight topological relations can be realized between two regions
embedded in IR2 . The 9-intersection matrix is shown in Fig. 2 (left). In order to represent the continuous change of spatial relations, Egenhofer presented
the Closest Topological Relation Graph (CTRG) [7] based on the deﬁnition of
topological distance. Fig. 2 (right) shows the CTRG of eight binary relations.

RCC62

An extension of 9-intersection matrix to 16-intersection matrix is made, then
RCC23 is reﬁned by adding 39 new relations based on 16-intersection matrix,
thus sixty-two topological relations between two simple concave regions are derived, which we call RCC62. The CNG and the CTRG of RCC62 are also given.
3.1

16-Intersection Matrix

Some basic deﬁnitions used in this paper are given below.
Deﬁnition 1. The convex hull of region x, denoted by conv(x), is the smallest
convex region of which x is a part. [4]
Deﬁnition 2. The inside of concave region x, denoted by inside(x), is the
diﬀerence of the convex hull of region x and the region itself.[4]
inside(x) ≡def ιy[∀z[C(z, y) ↔ ∃w[INSIDE(w, x) ∧ C(z, w)]]]

(1)

Deﬁnition 3. The outside of concave region x, denoted by outside(x), is the
complement part of the convex hull of region x.[4]
outside(x) ≡def ιy[∀z[C(z, y) ↔ ∃w[OUTSIDE(w, x) ∧ C(z, w)]]]

(2)

Deﬁnition 4. x is a concavity of region y, denoted by Concavity(x, y), when
predicate Concavity(x, y) is true.[9]
Concavity(x, y) ≡def MAX_P(x, inside(y))

(3)

Deﬁnition 5. Region x is a simple concave region, if it is concave and have
only one concavity.
Deﬁnition 6. The topological relation between two concave regions a and b, is
characterized by comparing a’s outside (a0 ), boundary (a1 ), interior (a2 ), inside
(a3 ) with b’s outside (b0 ), boundary (b1 ), interior (b2 ), inside (b3 ), thus concisely
represented as a 4 × 4 matrix, called the 16-intersection matrix which denoted by
⎛

a0 ∩ b 0
⎜ a0 ∩ b 1
R(a, b) = ⎜
⎝ a0 ∩ b 2
a0 ∩ b 3

a1 ∩ b 0
a1 ∩ b 1
a1 ∩ b 2
a1 ∩ b 3

a2 ∩ b 0
a2 ∩ b 1
a2 ∩ b 2
a2 ∩ b 3

⎞
a3 ∩ b 0
a3 ∩ b 1 ⎟
⎟
a3 ∩ b 2 ⎠
a3 ∩ b 3

(4)

If the intersection of ai and bj is non-empty, then the value of ai ∩bj is 1, otherwise
the value of ai ∩ bj is 0. Diﬀerent combinations in the intersection matrix can
represent diﬀerent topological relations. Note that since a3 is a virtual area
component, no boundary is deﬁned between a3 and a0 . Thus if a3 has a nonempty intersection with b1 , then it has also to intersect with b2 . Similarly, if b3
has a non-empty intersection with a1 , then it has also to intersect with a2 .
As illustrated in Fig. 3 (left), the topological relation between two simple
concave regions a and b is represented by their 16-intersection matrix.

3.2

Basic Relations of RCC62

The deﬁnition of 16-intersection matrix is useful for distinguish topological spatial relations of simple concave regions such as the bay of a small island b (i.e.b3 )
is outside, partially-inside, or inside a large island a, as shown in Fig. 3 (right).
These distinctions cannot be made using RCC23 since they represent the same
relation OPD.
In RCC23, the concave regions are considered as a whole part, while in
RCC62 it is decomposed into four sub-parts (i.e. a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ), thus based on
16-intersection matrix more topological relations can be derived between two
concave regions.
Here relation OPD in RCC23 is reﬁned to three new relations (i.e. R3 , R5 , R7 )
by considering that b3 intersects only with a0 , both with a0 , a3 , and only with
a3 . In the same way, RCC23 is reﬁned based on 16-intersection matrix, and
totally sixty-two topological relations between two simple concave regions are
deﬁned, which we call RCC62. The pictorial representation of the base relations
of RCC62 and their corresponding 16-intersection matrixes are shown in Fig. 4.
3.3

Relationship Between RCC23 and RCC62

Since RCC62 is derived from RCC23, there is a natural connection between
them. The relationship between RCC23 and RCC62 is given in Fig. 5. Basic

relations of RCC23 are represented by the solid ovals labeled with letters, while
relations in RCC62 are described by the hollow circles labeled with numbers.
Take an example, relation POD in RCC23 are reﬁned to three new relations (i.e.
R4 , R6 , R8 ) in RCC62. The arc between two basic relations of RCC23 denotes
a smooth transition between them. As shown in Fig. 5, there are more relations
can be distinguished in RCC62, thus it is more expressive than RCC23.
3.4

CNG and CTRG of RCC62

It is necessary to represent the change of spatial relations in spatial reasoning. In
qualitative reasoning we assume that change is continuous. The primary methods to represent the continuous change of spatial relations are the Conceptual
Neighborhood Graph (CNG) [7] and the Closest Topological Relation Graph
(CTRG) [8]. We give both the CNG and CTRG of RCC62, as shown in Fig. 6
(left) and Fig. 6 (right) respectively.

Conclusions

Topological relation is the most basic relation of spatial objects which is one of
the elementary aspects of spatial reasoning. The most popular models of topological relation are RCC and intersection models. However, few contributions are
available for topological relations between concave regions, in which one of the
typical models is Cohn’s RCC23. Nevertheless, RCC23 has some limitations in
the practical ﬁelds especially for spatial query. Therefore it is essential to establish a more expressive model of topological relations between concave regions.
In order to represent the topological relations between simple concave regions
in 2D space, an extension of 9-intersection matrix is made to 16-intersection
matrix, and RCC23 is reﬁned by adding 39 relations based on 16-intersection
method, thus derived RCC62, in which more relations can be distinguished, and
is more expressive than RCC23. The CNG and the CTRG of RCC62 which are
bases for the further reasoning of RCC62 are also given.
