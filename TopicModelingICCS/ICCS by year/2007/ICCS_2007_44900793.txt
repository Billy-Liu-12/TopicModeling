Abstract. Traﬃc sampling technology has been widely deployed in
front of many high-speed network applications to alleviate the great pressure on packet capturing. However, knowing the number and length of
the original ﬂows is necessary for some applications. This paper provides
a novel method that uses ﬂow statistics formed from sampled packet
stream to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths of ﬂows in the unsampled stream. First, ﬂows are classiﬁed as small (S) or large (L) based
on their probability that no packet is sampled. For large ﬂows we use
maximum likelihood estimation to infer their length distribution, and
for short ﬂows we apply least square method. The theoretical analysis
shows that the computational complexity of this method is well under
control, and the experiment results demonstrate the inferred distributions are as accurate as EM algorithm.

Introduction

With the rapid increase of network link speed, packet sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure ﬂow data. However, knowing the number
and lengths of the unsampled ﬂows is required for some applications. Sampling
entails an inherent loss of information. We expect use statistic inference to recover information as much as possible. However, more detailed characteristics of
the original traﬃc are not so easily estimated. Quantities of interest include the
number of packets in the ﬂow–we shall refer to this as the ﬂow length–and the
number of ﬂows with ﬁxed length.
In [1], the authors studied the statistical properties of packet-level sampling
using real-world Internet traﬃc traces. Scaling method and EM algorithm were
given to infer the ﬂow distribution from the sampled statistics in [2]. Scaling
method is simple, but it exploits the sampling properties of SYN ﬂows to estimate
TCP ﬂow frequencies; EM algorithm does not rely on the properties of SYN ﬂows

and hence is not restricted to TCP traﬃc, but its versatility comes at the cost
of computational complexity.
A ﬂow is deﬁned as a stream of packets subject to ﬂow speciﬁcation and
timeout. In this paper, we will use the term original ﬂow to describe the above
ﬂow. A sampled ﬂow is deﬁned as a stream of packets that are sampled at
probability p = 1/N from an original ﬂow.

Probability Distribution of Original Flow Length

For a speciﬁc original ﬂow F , let XF denote the number of packets in F ,
YF denote the number of packets in the sampled ﬂow from F . The conditional distribution of YF , given that XF = l, follows a binomial distribution

P r[XF = x|YF = y] =

P r[YF = y]

where P r[YF = y] =

Bp (i, y)P r[XF = i] by the complete probability formula.
i=y

Assume that original ﬂow lengths satisfy Pareto distribution. Its probability
mass function is
P r[XF = x] = βαβ /xβ+1 , α, β > 0, x ≥ α

where β is called Pareto parameter. By Equations (1)and (2), we have:
Lemma 1. Under the assumption that original ﬂow lengths satisfy Pareto distribution, the probability that a sampled ﬂow of length y(≥ α) is sampled from
an original ﬂow of length x is
P r[XF = x|YF = y] =

Bp (x, y)/xβ+1

Using similar method in [3], we obtain
Lemma 2. Under the assumption of Lemma 1, for ﬁxed p = 1/N, β and y(≥ α),
the probability P r[XF = x|YF = y] is maximized at x = N y − n(p, β). It is
increasing as x increases for x < N y − n(p, β) and decreasing as x increases for
x > N y − n(p, β).
The properties of function n(p, β) can be seen in [3].

Estimation Method of Flow Length Distributions

Let g = {gj : j = 1, 2, · · · , n}, where gj is sampled ﬂow frequencies of length j,
be a set of sampled ﬂow length frequencies, f = {fi : i = 1, 2, · · · , n, · · ·} a set
of original ﬂow length frequencies. Consider sampling the packets of an original
ﬂow of length N j independently with probability 1/N , the probability that no
packet is sampled is (1 − 1/N )N j = ((1 − 1/N )N )j . {(1 − 1/N )N } is increasing
in N and lim (1 − 1/N )N = 1/e < 0.37. Thus for a given error ε,we require
N →∞

(1 − 1/N )N j < (1/e)j < ε and choose jbord ≥ max(j(ε) = log(1/ε) , α). For
example, j(0.01) = 5, j(0.001) = 7. We classify two types of ﬂows based on their
probability that no packet is sampled. A ﬂow is labeled as small (S) when it’s
probability that no packet is sampled is more than ε and large (L) otherwise.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Large Flows

For a sampled ﬂow of length j > jbord , by Lemma 2, the original ﬂow length
values of the 2N relatively large probabilities are N (j −1)−n(p, β)+1, · · · , N (j +
1) − n(p, β) where β = 1.0. We estimate the sampled ﬂow is sampled from one
g
of the 2N original ﬂows. Then there are 2Nj sampled ﬂows that are sampled
from one of original ﬂows of the above lengths in gj (j > jbord ) sampled ﬂows.
Therefore, for all large ﬂows of length i > N jbord , we have
fi =

Least Square Method for Small Flows

For all small ﬂows of length i ≤ N jbord , we estimate as follows:

gj =

i=j

For i, l ∈ [α, N jbord ], i > l, by Equation (2) we have:
fi = (l/i)β+1 fl

Evaluations and Comparison

Computational complexity. Let imax denote the maximum original ﬂow length.
The computation for binomial coeﬃcients of Equations (4) is O(N jbord imax ).
The computation for least square method needs little time. We compare the computational complexity of our method against the best known EM algorithm in
[2] for estimating ﬂow distribution from sampled traﬃc. In [2] for all φi completing an EM iteration is O(i2max jsize ),where jsize denote the number of non-zero
sampled ﬂow length frequencies gj .
Estimation accuracy: We use some traces from [4,5] in our comparison experiments. Experimental results show the estimation accuracy of our algorithm
is close enough to that of EM algorithm. In most cases, our algorithm is much
more accurate.

Conclusions

In this paper we present a novel method for estimation of ﬂow length distributions from sampled ﬂow statistics. The main advantage is that it could signiﬁcantly reduce the computational complexity. The theoretical analysis shows that
the computational complexity of our method is well under control. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an accurate estimation for
ﬂow distribution.
