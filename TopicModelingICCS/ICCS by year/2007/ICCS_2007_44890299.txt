Abstract. A semicomplete multipartite digraph is obtained by replacing each edge of a complete multipartite graph by an arc or by a pair
of two mutually opposite arcs. In 2002, L.Volkmann [5] raised a problem: determine some suﬃcient conditions for semicomplete multipartite
digraphs such that every arc is contained in a Hamiltonian path. In this
paper, we give a new suﬃcient condition and describe some semicomplete multipartite digraphs demonstrating that this suﬃcient condition
is independent and in some sense, it is best possible.
Keywords: Semicomplete multipartite digraph, Hamiltonian paths,
Semi-partition complete digraphs.

Terminology and Introduction

In this paper all digraphs are ﬁnite without loops and multiple arcs. The vertex
set and the arc set of a digraph are denoted by V (D) and A(D), respectively.
The number of vertices in D is called the order of D. A digraph obtained by
replacing each edge of a complete n-partite graph by an arc or a pair of mutually opposite arcs is called a semicomplete n-partite or multipartite digraph.
Obviously, a tournament is a semicomplete multipartite digraph without cycles
of length 2 where each partite set contains exactly one vertex.
If xy is an arc of a digraph D, then we say that x dominates y and write
x → y. More generally, for disjoint subsets A and B of V (D) or subdigraphs
of D, if every vertex of A dominates every vertex of B, then we say that A
dominates B, denoted by A → B. In the case when there is no arc from B to
A, we write A ⇒ B. If both of A → B and A ⇒ B hold, then we say that
A strictly dominates B, denoted by A → B. Furthermore, if for all a ∈ A and

b ∈ B, either a, b are not adjacent or a → b, then we denote this relationship
between A and B by A → B. For S ⊆ V (D) and for any vertex x ∈ V (D), we
deﬁne d+ (x, S) (d− (x, S)) to be the number of out-neighbours (in-neighbours)
of x in S. If S = V (D), we also write d+ (x, D) = d+ (x) (d− (x, D) = d− (x)).
Furthermore, N + (S) (N − (S)) is the set of out-neighbours (in-neighbours) of S.
By a cycle (path) we mean a directed cycle (directed path). A path P =
x1 x2 .....xk starts with the arc x1 x2 , or x1 x2 is the initial arc of P . A cycle of
length m is an m-cycle. A cycle in a digraph D is Hamiltonian if it includes all
the vertices of D. A digraph D is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
If x is a vertex on a cycle, then x+ (x− ) denotes the successor (predecessor) of
x on C. If a cycle (path) Q contains a subpath from x to y, then we denote it
by Q[x, y]. A subdigraph F of a digraph D which contains all the vertices of D
and which consists of a set of vertex-disjoint cycles is called a 1-regular factor.
F is said to be minimal if there is no 1-regular factor F of D consisting of less
cycles than F .
For a vertex set X of digraph D, we deﬁne D[X] as the subdigraph induced
by X. A set X ⊆ V (D) is independent if the induced subdigraph D[X] has
no arcs. The independent number α(D) = α is the maximum size among the
independent sets of vertices of D. A digraph D is strong connected or strong if,
for each pair of vertices u and v, there is a path in D from u to v. A digraph
D with at least k + 1 vertices is k-connected if for any set A of at most k − 1
vertices, the subdigraph D−A obtained by deleting A is strong. The connectivity
of D, denoted by κ(D), is then deﬁned to be the largest value of k such that D
is k-connected.
Some ﬁrst observation on semicomplete multipartite digraphs can be found
in Moon’s book [3]. In the following decades graph theorists began to study
multipartite semicomplete digraphs more extensively. Excellent sources for more
information in this area are found in recent book by Bang-Jensen and Gutin [1].
In 2002, L.Volkmann [5] discussed the longest paths through an arc in strong
semicomplete multipartite digraphs and gave a suﬃcient condition such that all
arcs are contained in a Hamiltonian path.
Theorem 1 [5]. Let D be a semicomplete multipartite digraphs with κ(D) >
α(D), then every arc is contained in a Hamiltonian path.
In addition, L.Volkmann [5] posed the following problem:
Problem 1 [5]. Determine some suﬃcient conditions for semicomplete multipartite digraphs such that every arc is contained in a Hamiltonian path.
In this paper, we give a new suﬃcient condition in term of this problem. Furthermore, through examples we illustrate the independence of this suﬃcient condition and the best possibility in some sense. Moreover, a new class of semicomplete multipartite digraphs are introduced and we present a suﬃcient condition
for these digraphs to be Hamiltonian.

Preliminaries

The following results play an important role in our investigation. First the deﬁnition of semi-partition complete digraphs which was ﬁrst introduced by Guo
[2] and some properties of these digraphs are given.
Deﬁnition 1. Let D be a semicomplete multipartite digraph with the partite
sets V1 , V2 ,...,Vk . If d+ (xi , Vj ), d− (xi , Vj ) ≥ |Vj |/2 for every vertex xi ∈ Vi and
for every 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k, j = i, then D is called a semi-partition complete digraph.
Theorem 2 [2]. Let D be a semi-partition complete digraph of order n with
α(D) ≤ n/2. Then D is Hamiltonian or there exists two vertex-disjoint cycles C1
and C2 in D such that V (C1 )∪V (C2 ) = V (D) and |V (C1 )∩Vj | = |V (C2 )∩Vj | =
|Vj |/2 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k, where V1 , V2 , ..., Vk are the partite sets of D.
Now we state a shorten version of Yeo’s [6] result about the structure of semicomplete multipartite digraphs with a 1-regular factor.
Theorem 3 [6]. Let D be a semicomplete multipartite digraph containing a
1-regular factor. Then there exists a 1-regular factor F in D whose cycles can
be labeled, C1 , C2 , ..., Ct , such that the following holds:
There exists a partite set V ∗ in D such that whenever xj → x1 where xj ∈
−
∗
V (Cj ), x1 ∈ V (C1 ) and 1 < j ≤ t, we have {x+
j , x1 } ⊆ V .
In particular, if F is minimal, then it has the properties described above.

Main Results

Theorem 4. Let D be a semicomplete multipartite digraph with partite sets
V1 , V2 , ..., Vk . If d+ (xi , Vj ), d− (xi , Vj ) ≥ (|Vj | + 1)/2 for every vertex xi ∈ Vi , for
each 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k, j = i, and α(D) ≤ (n − 1)/2, then every arc is contained in a
Hamiltonian path.
Proof. Let xy be any arc of D. From the assumption we see that D − x is a
semi-partition complete digraph which satisﬁes α(D − x) ≤ α(D) ≤ (n − 1)/2 =
|V (D−x)|/2. According to Theorem 2, D−x is either Hamiltonian or there exists
two vertex-disjoint cycles C1 and C2 in D−x such that V (C1 )∪V (C2 ) = V (D−x)
and Ci contain exactly half of the vertices of every partite set of D−x, for i = 1, 2.
If D − x has a Hamiltonian cycle, denoted by yy2 y3 ...yn−1 y, then xy lies on
such a Hamiltonian path of D xyy2 y3 ...yn−1 . Then we are done.
Now, we assume that there exists two vertex-disjoint cycles C1 and C2 in D−x
satisfying the condition described as above. Assume without loss of generality
that y ∈ C1 ∩ V1 . Since x and y − are both adjacent to y, x and y − do not
belong to V1 . Note that C2 ∩ V1 = ∅, we claim that there exists at least one
vertex z ∈ C2 ∩ V1 such that y − → z. In fact, if this is not true, then we
have C2 ∩ V1 → y − . Hence, N + (y − , V1 ) ⊆ C1 ∩ V1 holds. Recalling x does
not belong to V1 , we have |C1 ∩ V1 | = |V1 |/2. This contradicts the assumption

d+ (y − , V1 ) ≥ (|V1 | + 1)/2. Now, the arc xy is on such a Hamiltonian path
xyC1 [y + , y − ]zC2 [z + , z − ]. This completes the proof.
An example will show that conditions in Theorem 4 are independent to Theorem 1.
Example 1. Let V1 = {v1 , v2 , v3 }, V2 = {v4 , v5 , v6 }, and V3 = {v7 } be the partite
sets of a semicomplete 3-partite digraphs D. The arcs between v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 are
v1 → v4 → v2 → v4 → v3 , and the other arcs between two vertices of diﬀerent
partite sets are two mutually opposite arcs. It is not diﬃcult to check that this
digraph D satisﬁes all conditions in Theorem 4 and hence, every arc is contained
in a Hamiltonian path.
Note that the vertices {v5 , v6 , v7 } is a separating set of D. So κ(D) ≤ 2, but
α(D) = 3. Therefore, D does not satisfy the conditions in Theorem 1.
In addition, at the proof of Theorem 4, we actually showed that every arc is
not only on a Hamiltonian path, but also the arc is exactly the initial arc of
the Hamiltonian path. In this sense, the degree-condition in Theorem 4 is best
possible. See the following example.
Example 2. Let V1 = {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 }, V2 = {y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 } and V3 = {z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 }
be the partite sets of a semicomplete 3-partite digraphs D. The arcs between
any two vertices in S1 = {x1 , y1 , z1 , x2 , y2 , z2 }, which belong to diﬀerent partite
sets are deﬁned by two mutually opposite arcs. Similarly, we deﬁne the arcs in
S2 = {x3 , y3 , z3 , x4 , y4 , z4 }. Moreover, S1 → S2 .
It is easy to see that D is a semicomplete 3-partite digraph with order 12,
α(D) = 4 and d+ (x3 , V2 ) = 2. But every arc in S2 is not on any Hamiltonian
path which starts with this arc.
In the following we abstract the conditions in Theorem 4 and deﬁne a new class
of semicomplete multipartite digraphs. Furthermore, we will present a suﬃcient
condition for these digraphs to be Hamiltonian.
Deﬁnition 2. Let D be a semicomplete multipartite digraph with partite sets
V1 ,V2 ,...,Vk . If d+ (xi , Vj ), d− (xi , Vj ) ≥ (|Vj | + 1)/2 for every vertex xi ∈ Vi and
for every 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k, j = i, then D is called a quasi-semi-partition complete
digraph.
Remark 1. According to Deﬁnition 2, Theorem 4 can be stated as: Let D be a
quasi-semi-partition complete digraph with order n and α(D) < n/2, then every
arc of D is contained in a Hamiltonian path.
Remark 2. Clearly, quasi-semi-partition complete digraphs are also semi-partition
complete digraphs.
Theorem 5. Every quasi-semi-partition complete digraph is strong.

Proof. Let D be a quasi-semi-partition complete digraph with partite sets
V1 , V2 , ..., Vk , and x, y any two distinct vertices of D.
If x, y ∈ Vi for some i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}, then for any j = i, and 1 ≤ j ≤ k, let
Aj = {a ∈ Vj | x → a}, Bj = {b ∈ Vj | x → b, b → x}, and Cj = {c ∈ Vj | c → x}.
Obviously, Aj , Bj , Cj are pairwise disjoint and Aj ∪ Bj ∪ Cj = Vj . Because of
d+ (x, Vj ) ≥ (|Vj |+1)/2, we know |Aj ∪Bj | ≥ (|Vj |+1)/2 and then, |Cj | < |Vj |/2.
Also note that d− (y, Vj ) ≥ (|Vj | + 1)/2, so there is at least one vertex in Aj ∪ Bj
which dominates y, say u. According to the deﬁnitions of Aj and Bj , xuy is a
path in D from x to y. Similarly, we can show that there is also a path from y
to x.
Now we suppose that x ∈ Vi , y ∈ Vj for some i, j ∈ {1, 2, ..., k} and i = j.
Since x and y are adjacent, we assume without loss of generality that x → y.
If y → x also holds, then there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, we have x → y.
Let A = {a ∈ Vi | a → y}, B = {b ∈ Vi | y → b, b → y}, C = {c ∈ Vi | y → c},
L = {d ∈ Vj | x → d}, M = {e ∈ Vj | x → e, e → x} and N = {f ∈ Vj | f → x}.
Clearly, L, M, N are pairwise disjoint, L ∪ M ∪ N = Vj and B = ∅. Because of
d− (x, Vj ) ≥ (|Vj | + 1)/2, we know |M ∪ N | ≥ (|Vj | + 1)/2 and then, |L| < |Vj |/2.
Now we claim that there is at least one arc uv in D from B to M ∪ N . In
fact, if this is not true, then M ∪ N → B and for any vertex b of B, we have
N + (b, Vj ) ⊆ L. So d+ (b, Vj ) ≤ |L| < |Vj |/2, a contradiction ! By the deﬁnitions
of B, M and N , we see that y → u and v → x hold. Hence, yuvx is just a path
in D from y to x.
In summary, D is strongly connected.
By using Theorem 5, we obtain a suﬃcient condition for a quasi-semi-partition
complete digraph to be Hamiltonian.
Theorem 6. Let D be a quasi-semi-partition complete digraph with α(D) ≤
n/2. Then D is Hamiltonian.
Proof. From Remark 2 and Theorem 2, D is either Hamiltonian or there exists
two vertex-disjoint cycles C1 and C2 in D such that V (C1 ) ∪ V (C2 ) = V (D) and
|V (C1 )∩Vj | = |V (C2 )∩Vj | = |Vj |/2 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k, where V1 , V2 , ..., Vk are the
partite sets of D. We only need to consider the latter case. Obviously, C1 , C2 is
the minimal 1-regular factor. Thus, according to Theorem 3, we may assume that
C1 , C2 and V ∗ just satisﬁes Theorem 3. Theorem 5 ensue that D is strong, hence
there are vertices u ∈ C1 and v ∈ C2 such that v → u. Furthermore, u− ∈ V ∗ and
u− → V (C2 )∩(V −V ∗ ). In fact, u− is adjacent to any vertex of V (C2 )∩(V −V ∗ ).
If there exists a vertex in V (C2 ) ∩ (V − V ∗ ) which dominates u− , then again
by Theorem 3, we deduce u−− ∈ V ∗ , but this is clearly not impossible. For any
partite set V diﬀerent from V ∗ , we have d− (u− , V ) ≤ |C1 ∩ V | = |V |/2. This
contradicts the deﬁnition of quasi-semi-partition complete digraphs. Therefore,
D is Hamiltonian.
