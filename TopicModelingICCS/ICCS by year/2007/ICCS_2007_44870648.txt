Abstract. A new algorithm for fault-tolerant routing based on detour and
backtracking techniques is developed for m-ary n-cube multi-computer networks. We analyzed its performance under the condition that when an arbitrary number of components have been damaged and derived some exact
expressions for the probability of routing messages via optimal paths from
the source node to obstructed node. The probability of routing messages
via an optimal path between any two nodes is a special case of our results, and can be obtained by replacing the obstructed node with the
destination node.

Introduction

m-ary n-cube usually denoted by Qn (m) is a kind of generalized hypercube
and has drawn many attention. [1] showed that the restricted connectivity is
2n(m − 1) − m and the restricted fault diameter can be controlled to be less than
n + 3. [2] and [3] concluded that there are n(m − 1) disjoint paths linking any
two nodes and the n(m − 1)−wide diameter is n + 1. Two deterministic shortest
and fastest routing algorithm have been proposed in [3]. [4]and [5]designed the
fault-tolerant routing schemes for Qn (m). [6] discussed its fault tolerance and
transmitting delay. Other parameters can be found in [7].
We shall develop a routing scheme for Qn (m), in which each message is accompanied with a stack which keeps track of the history of the path travelled as
it is routed toward its destination, and tries to avoid visiting a node more than
once unless a backtracking is enforced, each node is required to know only the
condition (faulty or not) of its adjacent components. This routing algorithm is
analyzed rigorously. Similar discussion has been made for hypercube ([8]).
The ﬁrst node in the message’s route that is aware of the nonexistence of an
optimal path from itself to the destination is called obstructed node. At the obstructed node, the message has to take a detour. In this paper, we derive exact
expressions for the probabilities of optimal path routing from the source node to
a given obstructed node in the presence of components failures. Note that determination of the probability for optimal path routing between any two nodes can
be viewed as an obstructed node that is 0 hop away from the destination node.

Qn (m) has vertex set V (Qn (m)) = {x1 x2 . . . xn , xi ∈ {0, 1 . . . , m− 1}}, x and
y are adjacent if and only if they diﬀer by exactly one bit. For x = x1 x2 . . . xn ,
the leftmost coordinate of the address will be referred to as 1-dimension, and
the second to the leftmost coordinate as 2-dimension, and so on.
Suppose x = x1 x2 x3 . . . xn and y = y1 y2 y3 . . . yn be two nodes of Qn (m), xy
is an edge of i−dimension if xj = yj for j = i and xi = yi . From the deﬁnition,
Qn (m) contains mn vertices and mn n(m − 1)/2 edges and Qn (m) is n(m − 1)regular with diameter n.
An optimal path is a path whose length is equal to the Hamming distance
between the source and destination. We call the routing via an optimal path the
optimal path routing. An incident link of node x is said to be toward another
node y if the link belongs to one of the optimal path from x to y and call y the
forward node of x.
A given path of length k between x and y in Qn (m) can be described by
a coordinate sequence C = [c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ] where 1 ≤ ci ≤ n, the coordinate
sequence is a sequence of ordered pairs. A coordinate sequence is said to be
simple if any dimension does not occur more than once in that sequence. It is
easy to see that a path is optimal if and only if its coordinate sequence is simple.
For example, [0002, 0000, 0010, 2010] is an optimal path from 0002 to 2010, and
can be represented by a coordinate sequence [4, 3, 1].
The number of inversions of a simple coordinate sequence C = [c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ]
denoted by V (C), is the number of pairs (ci , cj ) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k but
ci > cj . For example V ([4, 3, 1]) = 3.

Routing Algorithm

Algorithm A: Fault-tolerant Routing Algorithm
Step 1. If u = d, the message is reached destination, Stop.
Step 2. If the forward adjacent node v of u is normal and the link uv is normal
and v ∈
/ T D, select such a vertex v satisﬁed i = min{i : uv is an edge of i −
dimension}, then
send (message T D) to v, T D = T D ∪ {u}, u = v.
Step 3. If v is a adjacent node of u and satisﬁes the following condition:
1. v ∈
/ TD
2. v is not a forward node node of u to d
3. v and uv are normal components
select such a vertex v satisﬁed that j = min{j : uv is an edge of j − dimension},
then send (message T D) to v, T D = T D ∪ {v}, u = v. Go to Step 1.
Step 4. If the algorithm is not terminated yet, then Backtracking is taken, the
message must be returned to the node from which this message was originally
received. Go to Step 3.

Theorem 1. Suppose x and y are respectively the source and destination in
Qn (m), H(x, y) = n. Then the number of fault components required for the
simple coordinate sequence C = [c1 , c2 , . . . , ct ] to be the path chosen by algorithm

Let S(n, r) be the set of combinations of r diﬀerent numbers out of {1, . . . , n} and
In (r) denote the number of permutations of n numbers with exactly r inversions.
Theorem 2. Suppose there are f fault links in a m−ary n−cube computer network, and a message is routed by A from node x to node y where H(x, y) = n.
Let hL be the Hamming distance between obstructed node and the destination
node. Then

The probability of an optimal path routing can be viewed as a special case
of Theorem 2 by setting the obstructed node to the destination node, namely,
P (hL = 0).
Corollary 1. The probability for a message to be routed in an Qn (m) with f
fault links via an optimal path to a destination node which is n hops away can
be expressed as

Conclusion

This paper proposed a new fault-tolerant routing algorithm for m-ary n-cube.
This algorithm is based on the detour and backtracking technique. The knowledge on the number os inversions of a given permutation is used to analyze the
performance of this routing. The number of faulty components required for a coordinate sequence to become the coordinate sequence of a path toward a given
obstructed node is determined.Probability for routing messages via optimal path
to given obstructed node location are determined.
