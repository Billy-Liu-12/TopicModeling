Abstract. This paper presents a new type of digital payment method and algorithm for embedded systems including mobile phone and other handheld
devices. In the conventional mobile payment system, a payment signal transmitting device and a wireless internet connection device are separately provided to
mobile systems. Therefore, the production cost of the mobile devices increases,
and the complexity and the size of the mobile devices grow. In order to solve
the problems, a new digital payment method using light signal containing payment-related information is suggested for mobile phone and embedded devices.
The new method provides an economic and efficient solution to mobile payment system by updating embedded software without need of additional hardware modules to mobile devices.

1 Introductions
The trend of digital and mobile convergence in IT technology brings multifunctionality to mobile embedded devices including phones and PDAs. As a result,
various functions such as digital camera, camcoder, mp3 player, which were produced
and purchased as independent devices before are now integrated in a single phone or
embedded device. One of those functionalities is digital cash or payment system.
In recent years, several mobile payment methods or systems have been developed
in order to avoid the inconvenience of carrying cash or credit card [1]-[7]. Those
payment systems are mainly used for mobile phone devices and mostly for smallvalued payment. However, in conventional mobile payment systems, a payment
signal transmitting device and a wireless internet connection device are separately
provided to the mobile phone or embedded devices. Therefore, the production cost of
the mobile phone or devices increases, and the complexity and size of the mobile
devices grow. In addition, there is another critical problem in that the users who want
to use the mobile payment system may need to purchase a new phone or devices with
additional hardware functions.
In order to solve the aforementioned problems, a new mobile payment method is
proposed. The method is implemented by updating embedded software of a phone

without the need of additional hardware modules to the existing mobile phone or
devices. In the proposed method, a virtual mobile card containing payment-related
information is loaded to the virtual machine in the mobile phone or embedded system
OS. The virtual mobile card can comprise various types of payment-related information such as credit card number, membership card number, discount coupon image,
online ticket, etc., which are downloaded from a control server and stored in the mobile phone or devices. The virtual mobile card information is transmitted by image by
blinking the backlight of the LCD/LED panel of the mobile devices, and the transmitted information is decoded by the photo receiver which is designed for the proposed
mobile payment system. The data transmission function is implemented by embedded
software that controls the lightning device of a phone or handheld systems, which can
be applied to the most mobile phone already in use.
In the following Section 2, the characteristics of existing mobile payment systems
are presented and compared with the proposed method. Section 3 describes the proposed mobile payment system model and its detailed subsystems; the mobile phone,
the photo receiver, and the control server. Section 4 presents the payment procedure
of the proposed method, and Section 5 summarizes the paper.

2 Mobile Phone Payment Systems
In Korea, it is believed that normally 4 or 5 credit cards are owned and carried per
adult person in addition to transportation card, debit card, membership card, ID card,
and etc. [8] There is a problem in that, when the cards are lost or stolen, the owner
may suffer a great deal of damages. In order to solve the inconvenience of carrying
various cards, several approaches have been tried to put those card information into a
phone or other embedded devices. The approaches include barcode-based solution,
and IR/RF-based solution as presented in Table 1.
Some telecom companies adapted barcode type membership card into mobile
phones and used it as mobile payment and membership authentication[9]. This
method is easy to implement and widely applicable to membership management applications. The weak point of this method is that the information being contained by a
barcode is very limited. Moreover, if conventional laser type barcode reader devices
are used, many transmission errors occur because of the reflection problem on the
surface of the display device of a phone. Therefore, CCD type reader device is needed
which increase the cost of system. In addition, barcode type information can be easily
copied thus incurs security problem.
More widely adapted mobile payment method is using IrDA (Infrared Data Association) or RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to integrate payment
related information into a phone or embedded devices[10]. This method shows high
ability of processing large volume of data and multimedia applications, and provides
high level of security management functions. However, the shortcoming of this
method is that it requires additional hardware modules. Therefore, users should have
specialized phones or devices with the additional hardware module instead of existing
devices already in use, which makes widespread use of this method difficult.

A new mobile payment method is proposed to solve the problems of existing payment methods. This method can be applied to the most mobile phones or devices
already in use by updating embedded software without additional hardware modules.

3 Light Signal Based Mobile Payment System
The proposed mobile payment method transmits payment related information using
the backlight of devices which is adopted in most mobile phones and embedded devices, thus eliminates the need of supplying new customized devices. The payment
information using backlight signal is called virtual mobile card. The virtual mobile
card based payment method has the following characteristics.

The software application program is downloaded to the virtual machine of a
phone or embedded devices.
The optical source such as LCS backlight or keypad backlight of existing
phones or devices is used for information transmission including software
download and payment.
Various types of security management solutions can be implemented by software.
Large volume of card information data can be adopted as long as the embedded memory size allows.
The card information can be downloaded by wireless connection immediately
after the subscription.

CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and other applications can be easily applicable by coordination with phone number information.
The cost of optical reader device is relatively cheap compared with CCD type
readers or IR/RF type readers.

The virtual mobile card is downloaded from control server. The control server first
sends the Callback URL which contains WAP address in the SMS page, and the users
of phones or embedded devices access the address and download the application program and information. The mobile payment procedure is similar to the mobile game
play procedure. The display device of a phone is attached to the photo receiver and
the request and reply data is transmitted between the PCs in the branch office and the
server in the main office as shown in Fig. 1.

Our mobile payment system using a light signal consists of three parts: a mobile
phone for generating a predetermined light signal; a photo receiver for converting the
received light signal to an electrical signal, encrypting the electrical signal, and generating the encrypted electrical signal as an output signal; and the control server for
authenticating payment by using the output signal of the photo receiver.
Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing a mobile phone payment system. The system
comprises a mobile phone 111, a photo receiver 121, and a control server 131.
In general, the mobile phone 111 has a display unit such as an LCD, an EL, and an
organic EL illuminated with a backlight. Some types of the mobile phone 111 may
have a keypad illuminated with a keypad-dedicated backlight such as a blue LED. In
the mobile phone payment system, a light signal is generated in a form of pulses by
turning on and off the backlight of the mobile phone based on payment-related information. In other words, the light signal contains the payment-related information. Therefore, the user of the mobile phone can make payments by using his or her mobile phone.
In order to use the mobile phone payment system 101, the user accesses the control
server 131 to subscribe to the mobile phone payment service by transmitting his or
her personal information to the control server 131. The personal information includes
identification (ID) information, a credit card number, an E-mail address, E-money

information, and a phone number of the user. The control server 131 stores the personal information in a data storage unit. The user downloads a program used for the
mobile phone payment service from the control server 131 and installs the program in
the mobile phone 111.
The user can pay a charge by using the mobile phone 111. The charge includes,
for example, a charge for a game machine and a roller coaster, a charge for a gambling machine, an admission fee of a theater, a toll, a public vehicle fare, and a parking fee. In addition, the mobile phone 111 may be used to pay a price of gasoline, a
vending-machine item. In addition, mobile phone 111 may be also used to transfer Emoney in ATM.
A photo receiver 121 decodes a light signal from a mobile phone, converting the
light signal to an electrical signal, and transmitting the electrical signal to a control
server. The photo receiver comprising: a photo sensor for receiving a light signal from
a mobile phone, and converting the light signal into an electrical signal; a data error
determination unit for receiving the electrical signal of the photo sensor and determining an error of the electrical signal; a control unit for transmitting the electrical signal
of the photo sensor to the data error determination unit, generating a control signal
based on the result of the error determination by data error determination unit, and
generating the electrical signal if the electrical signal has no error; a display unit for
displaying presence or absence of the error of the light signal in response to the control signal; and a communication unit for transmitting the electrical signal from the
control unit to the control server.
The photo receiver may further comprise an encryption unit for encrypting the
electrical signal transmitted from the control unit, and a communication unit for
transmitting the encrypted signal by the encryption unit to the control server.
The display unit may comprise at least one of a third lighting device which is
turned on, if a signal indicating that the payment-related information transmitted from
the mobile phone is correct is transmitted from the control server, and a forth lighting
device is turned on, if not, and the control unit may receive a predetermined signal
from the control server via the communication unit and control the operation of the
display unit in accordance with the received signal.
