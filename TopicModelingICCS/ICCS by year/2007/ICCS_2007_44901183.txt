Abstract. Through analyzing schema theorem and building blocks theory,
propose parallel genetic algorithms based on building blocks migration. Relying
on convergence condition, receive building blocks from other populations. Using
simulated annealing method prevent the density of good schema to increase
greatly which will result in premature convergence. Theory analysis and
experimental results show that the method not only reduce ineffective migration
and decrease communication costs, but also lower the possibility of occurring
premature and assure the capability of global convergence.
Keywords: parallel genetic algorithm, schema theorem, building blocks theory,
simulated annealing, migration strategy.

1 Introduction
In recent years, many specialists have been researching and made significant
contributions in PGA[1]. However, How to improve algorithm performance[2] and the
extensibility of PGA are still barriers blocking PAG advancing[3].
In this paper, we introduce a new migration strategy which base on building blocks
theory and integrate Boltzmann survivor mechanism to reduce communication cost and
enhance coarse-grained PGA searching efficiency.

2 Building Block Operator
To guarantee to find global solution, the population should contain at least one
same-defining-position-non-overlapping set, which can completely cover the whole
solution area.
Definition 1. If population exists a building blocks[4] set {H 1 , H 2

⋅ ⋅ ⋅ H n } , and

satisfy H a ∩ H b = ∅ , where ∀a, b ∈ {1,2 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ k } . The intersection is null if and only
if no identical value in the same locus. Therefore the set mentioned above is
non-overlapping BBs set.
Set threshold θ 0 , S (1) =

n

∑x
j =1

ij

where xij =1.

P(1) = S (1) n .If P(1) > θ 0 , the

value 1 is accepted to make up BBs, otherwise1-P(1)> θ 0 , the value 0 is accepted to
make up BBs, else accept *.

3 An Outline of Simulated Annealing Parallel Genetic Algorithm
Based on Building Blocks Migration
STEP 1. Initialize population S L = {0,1} L randomly, and calculate population fitness.
STEP 2. If existing migrations do follows; else return the global solution.
STEP 3. If iloop, when children fitness lower than parents, we consider premature
convergence in GA process, and do STEP 4.else continue GA process.
STEP 4. When GA proceeds slowly, it means that subpopulation converge to a local
optimum, we extract building block H l ,and select BBs which nearly or exactly match
the principle of non-overlapping.
STEP 5. Use Metropolis strategy[5] to accept building blocks which migrate from other
population. The equation is described below by:

p accept

⎧
f migrator − f

)) > random[0,1)

f migrator ≤ f
f migrator > f

(1)

As the temperature of annealing fall, the probability of accepting bad solution
diminishes. The Metropolis avoids GA to trap in local optimum.

4 Communication Costs
In coarse grained PGA, overall cost V[6] estimated casually is described below as:

V =[

m
g
− 2] × ∑ ri s i b
MI
j =1

(2)

However the overall cost of BBsAPGA described below by equation:

⎡g⎤
V ' = ⎢ ⎥ × mb
⎣C ⎦
C denote premature interval. Obviously, C = nMI .

ΔV = V − V ' = [

g
g
g
− 2] × ∑ ri s i b − [ ] × mb

Therefore, BBsAPGA effectively lower communication cost, decrease ineffective
number of migration.

5 Experimental Results
To investigate the parallel efficiency of PGA and genetic operators, we conduct
experiments on a cluster. All computations are performed on HP P4(3G),512 memory.

The result of experiment manifest BBsAPGA effectively lower communication cost,
decrease ineffective number of migration. Meanwhile this algorithm overcome
premature convergence phenomena, accelerate evolution, enhance global searching.

6 Conclusions
Analyze schema theorem and building blocks theory deduced by schema theorem,
introduce building block operator. Integrating Boltzmann survivor mechanism propose
a simulated annealing parallel genetic algorithm based on building blocks. The
BBsAPGA reduce ineffective migration, decrease cost of communication. Evidently it
lower premature probability and ensure GA global convergence.
