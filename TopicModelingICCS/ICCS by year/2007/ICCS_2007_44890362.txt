Abstract. An f -coloring of a graph G is an edge-coloring of G such
that each color appears at each vertex v ∈ V (G) at most f (v) times. The
minimum number of colors needed to f -color G is called the f -chromatic
index of G, and denoted by χf (G). Any simple graph G has f -chromatic
index equal to Δf (G) or Δf (G)+1, where Δf (G) = maxv∈V (G) { fd(v)
}.
(v)
If χf (G) = Δf (G), then G is of f -class 1; otherwise G is of f -class 2.
In this paper, we show that if f (v) is positive and even for all v ∈
V0∗ (G) ∪ NG (V0∗ (G)), then G is of f -class 1, where V0∗ (G) = {v ∈ V (G) :
d(v)
= Δf (G)} and NG (V0∗ (G)) = {v ∈ V (G) : uv ∈ E(G), u ∈ V0∗ (G)}.
f (v)
This result improves the simple graph version of a result of Hakimi and
Kariv [4].
Keywords: Edge-coloring, simple graph, f -coloring, f -chromatic index.

Introduction

Our terminologies and notations will be standard, except where indicated. The
reader is referred to [1] for the undeﬁned terms. Throughout this paper, a graph
G allows multiple edges but no loops and has a ﬁnite nonempty vertex set V (G)
and a ﬁnite edge set E(G). If G has neither loops nor multiple edges, we will
call G a simple graph.
An edge-coloring of G is an assignment of colors to all the edges of G. A
proper edge-coloring of G is an edge-coloring of G such that no two adjacent
edges are assigned the same color. The minimum number of colors for which
such a proper edge-coloring of G exists is called the chromatic index of G, and
denoted by χ (G). Hakimi and Kariv [4] generalized the proper edge-coloring
and obtained many interesting results. Let G be a graph and f be a function
which assigns a positive integer f (v) to each vertex v ∈ V (G). An f -coloring
of G is an edge-coloring of G such that each vertex v has at most f (v) edges
colored with the same color. The minimum number of colors needed to f -color
G is called the f -chromatic index of G, and denoted by χf (G). If f (v) = 1 for
all v ∈ V (G), the f -coloring problem, which is to determine χf (G) of a given
graph G, is reduced to the proper edge-coloring problem.

A Class of Graphs of f -Class 1

363

f -colorings have many applications in scheduling problems such as the ﬁle
transfer problem in a computer network (see [2, 3, 6]). Since the proper edgecoloring problem is NP-complete [5], the f -coloring problem is also NP-complete.
Hakimi and Kariv [4] studied the f -coloring problem and obtained some upper
bounds on χf (G). Nakano et al. [8] obtained another upper bound on χf (G).
In the proper edge-coloring, one of the most celebrated results, which is due
to Vizing [9], is that χ (G) = Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1 for any simple graph G. This
result naturally partitions all simple graphs into two classes. We say that simple
graph G is of class 1 if χ (G) = Δ(G), and of class 2 otherwise. Signiﬁcantly,
we have a similar result to simple graphs on f -colorings. We deﬁne
Δf (G) = max {
v∈V (G)

d(v)
},
f (v)

where fd(v)
is the smallest integer not smaller than
(v)
χf (G) ≥ Δf (G).

d(v)
f (v) .

It is trivial that

Lemma 1. [10, 11] Let G be a simple graph. Then
Δf (G) ≤ χf (G) ≤ max {
v∈V (G)

d(v) + 1
} ≤ Δf (G) + 1.
f (v)

For the sake of self-completeness, a proof of Lemma 1 can be obtained by Lemma
3 later. Similarly, we can classify simple graphs into two classes according to
their f -chromatic indices. We say that simple graph G is of f -class 1 if χf (G) =
Δf (G), and of f -class 2 otherwise. Zhang and Liu [10, 11], Zhang, Wang and
Liu [12] studied the classiﬁcation of complete graphs, simple regular graphs and
some other special classes of simple graphs on f -colorings. Liu, hou and Cai [7]
studied the properties of f -critical graphs (i.e. connected simple graphs G of
f -class 2 satisfying that χf (G − e) < χf (G) for any edge e ∈ E(G)).
In Section 2 we present a useful lemma, by which we can easily deduce two
results of Hakimi and Kariv [4]. In Section 3, we give a new suﬃcient condition
for a simple graph to be of f -class 1, which generalizes the simple graph version
of a result of Hakimi and Kariv [4]. In Section 4 we conclude that this condition
is best in a sense, and brieﬂy discuss some problems for further research.

A Useful Lemma

Let G be a graph, Q ⊆ E(G) and Q = ∅. We use G[Q] to denote the subgraph of
G induced by Q. A partial edge-coloring of G is an edge-coloring of a subgraph
G[Q] of G. When Q = E(G), a partial edge-coloring of G is exactly an edgecoloring of G. Let C denote the set of colors available to color the edges of a
graph G. An edge colored with color α ∈ C is called an α-edge. We denote by
|α(v)| the number of α-edges of G incident with the vertex v ∈ V (G). Given a
partial edge-coloring of G with the colors in C, a vertex v of G is called f -proper
if |c(v)| ≤ f (v) for each c ∈ C. All vertices of G are f -proper if and only if G is

given a partial f -coloring. Note that any subgraph G of G has fG (v) = fG (v)
for all v ∈ V (G ).
A circuit is a connected graph in which each vertex has even degree. Denote
|E(G)| by ε(G). A circuit G is even, or odd, if ε(G) is even, or odd, respectively. A
walk W is a sequence of distinct edges v0 v1 , v1 v2 , . . . , vk−1 vk , where the vertices
v0 , v1 , . . . , vk are not necessarily distinct. An Eulerian circuit of a graph G is a
closed walk (i.e. v0 = vk ) that traverses every edge in G. It is well known that
every circuit has an Eulerian circuit. Given a partial edge-coloring of graph G,
we call a connected subgraph H of G an obstruction (to a partial f -coloring), if
ε(H) is odd and dH (v) = 2f (v) for each v ∈ V (H). Clearly, any obstruction is
an odd circuit. Denote by G(v; α, β) the component containing v of the subgraph
of G induced by all α-edges and all β-edges.
Lemma 2. Let G be a graph and w ∈ V (G). Let C = {c1 , c2 , . . . , cΔf (G) }.
Suppose that G is given a partial edge-coloring with the colors in C such that
all vertices but w are f -proper. Let α, β ∈ C such that |α(w)| = maxc∈C {|c(w)|}
and |β(w)| = minc∈C {|c(w)|}. Also, suppose that the vertex w has
|α(w)| = f (w) + 1,
|c(w)| ≤ f (w)
f or each c ∈ C and c = α.
If H = G(w; α, β) is not an obstruction, then we can recolor H such that all
vertices of G are f -proper.
Proof. By the choice of β, we claim that |β(w)| ≤ f (w) − 1. Otherwise, the
number of the edges colored and incident with w is (Δf (G) − 1)f (w) + f (w) + 1.
Clearly, (Δf (G) − 1)f (w) + f (w) + 1 > Δf (G)f (w) ≥ d(w). A contradiction.
Let m represent the set m with respect to the new partial edge-coloring of
G after recoloring H. We will recolor H with α and β. Obviously, all vertices in
V (G) \ V (H) remain f -proper, and the edges colored with colors other than α
and β remain unchanged.
Next, we consider three cases as follows.
Case 1. H is not a circuit.
Then it has even vertices with odd degree. Pair oﬀ the vertices with odd degree,
and join the two vertices of each pair by an extra edge. The graph H ∗ so formed
is a circuit, and then it has an Eulerian circuit. Starting with an extra edge and
following an Eulerian circuit, we color the edges of H ∗ with α and β alternately.
Restrict H ∗ to H. Obviously, we have ||(α(v)) | − |(β(v)) || ≤ 1 for all v ∈ V (H).
||(α(v)) | − |(β(v)) || = 1 if and only if dH (v) is odd. So ||(α(v)) | − |(β(v)) || ≤
||α(v)| − |β(v)|| for all v ∈ V (H). Then we have max{|(α(v)) |, |(β(v)) |} ≤
max{|α(v)|, |β(v)|} for all v ∈ V (H). So all vertices but w are still f -proper.
For vertex w, since |α(w)| − |β(w)| ≥ 2, we have ||(α(w)) | − |(β(w)) || ≤ 1 <
|α(w)| − |β(w)|. Then max{|(α(w)) |, |(β(w)) |} < |(α(w))| = f (w) + 1. So w is
f -proper now.
Case 2. H is an even circuit.
Then it has an Eulerian circuit. Starting at w and following an Eulerian circuit,
color the edges of H with α and β alternately. Now we have |(α(v)) | = |(β(v)) |,

A Class of Graphs of f -Class 1

365

i.e. |(α(v)) | − |(β(v)) | = 0, for all v ∈ V (H). Note that |α(w)| − |β(w)| ≥ 2. we
can see that all vertices of G are f -proper now.
Case 3. H is an odd circuit, but not an obstruction.
By the assumption about H, there is at least one vertex in it, say v1 , at
which |α(v1 )| + |β(v1 )| ≤ 2f (v1 ) − 2. Find an Eulerian circuit and color the
edges in it with α and β alternately starting at v1 . Then we have ||(α(v1 )) | −
|(β(v1 )) || = 2 and |(α(v)) | = |(β(v)) | for each v = v1 in V (H). For vertex v1 ,
max{|(α(v1 )) |, |(β(v1 )) |} ≤ f (v1 ). Then all vertices of G are f -proper now.
We deﬁne M (v) = {c ∈ C : |c(v)| < f (v)} and Ej = {e1 , e2 , . . . , ej } (1 ≤ j ≤
ε(G)). By Lemma 2, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Let G be a graph. If there is no obstruction in G, then χf (G) =
Δf (G).
Proof. To see this point, we present an f -coloring of G with colors in C =
{c1 , c2 , . . . , cΔf (G) } by coloring the edges of G in an arbitrary order e1 , e2 , . . . ,
eε(G) . For the ﬁrst edge e1 = w1 v1 , there are M (w1 ) = M (v1 ) = C. Thus
G[E1 ] can be f -colored with an arbitrary color in C. Suppose that G[Ej−1 ] is
f -colored so far, 2 ≤ j ≤ ε(G). When color the jth edge ej = wj vj , we consider two cases. If M (wj ) ∩ M (vj ) = ∅, color ej with a color in M (wj ) ∩ M (vj ),
and then G[Ej ] is f -colored. If M (wj ) ∩ M (vj ) = ∅, then color ej with a color
α ∈ M (vj ). Now, all vertices but wj are f -proper. In particular, for vertex wj ,
we have |α(wj )| = f (wj ) + 1 and |c(wj )| ≤ f (wj ) for each c ∈ C and c = α. By
Lemma 2, we can obtain an f -coloring of G[Ej ] with colors in C, 2 ≤ j ≤ ε(G).
So χf (G) = Δf (G).
Obviously, a bipartite graph contains no odd circuit. A graph G, in which f (v)
is positive and even for all v ∈ V (G), contains no obstruction. The reason is
that, for any circuit H of G with dH (v) = 2f (v) for each v ∈ V (H), ε(H) =
( v∈V (H) 2f (v))/2 = v∈V (H) f (v) is even. Therefore, two results of Hakimi
and Kariv [4] are immediately derived from Theorem 1.
Corollary 2. [4] Let G be a bipartite graph. Then χf (G) = Δf (G).
Corollary 3. [4] Let G be a graph. If f (v) is positive and even for all v ∈ V (G),
then χf (G) = Δf (G).

Main Results

We denote the neighbor set of vertex set S in G by NG (S) for S ⊆ V (G). Let
V0∗ (G) = {v ∈ V (G) :

d(v)
= Δf (G)}.
f (v)

Then NG (V0∗ (G)) = {v ∈ V (G) : uv ∈ E(G), u ∈ V0∗ (G)}. The f -core of a graph
G is the subgraph of G induced by the vertices of V0∗ (G) and is denoted by GΔf .

There has been great interest in properties of the f -core GΔf of a simple graph
G, which would guarantee that G is of f -class 1. For example, if GΔf is a forest,
then G is of f -class 1 [11]. The quasi-f -core of a graph G is the subgraph of G
induced by the vertices of V0∗ (G) ∪ NG (V0∗ (G)). In fact, the f -chromatic index of
a simple graph G has very close relations with the quasi-f -core of G. Later, we
can see that if the quasi-f -core of G can be f -colored with r(≥ Δf (G)) colors,
then the following Lemma 3 guarantees that G can be f -colored with r colors.
Before proceeding, we need some new notations and deﬁnitions.
We deﬁne m(v, α) = f (v) − |α(v)| for each v ∈ V (G) and each α ∈ C. Clearly,
given an edge-coloring of G with the colors in C, G is f -colored if and only if
m(v, α) ≥ 0 for each v ∈ V (G) and each α ∈ C. Color α is available at vertex
v if m(v, α) ≥ 1. Obviously M (v) = {α ∈ C : m(v, α) ≥ 1} for each v ∈ V (G).
Walk W is often denoted simply by v0 v1 . . . vk . We call v0 the start vertex of
W and vk the end vertex. The length of W is the number k of edges in W , and
denoted by |W |.
We now describe two tools commonly used for f -colorings of simple graphs.
(1) ab-alternating walks
For two distinct colors a, b ∈ C, a walk W of length one or more is called an
ab-alternating walk if W satisﬁes the following conditions:
(a) The edges of W are colored alternately with a and b, and the ﬁrst edge of
W is colored with b;
(b) m(v0 , a) ≥ 1 if v0 = vk ,
m(v0 , a) ≥ 2 if v0 = vk and |W | is odd;
(c) m(vk , b) ≥ 1 if v0 = vk and |W | is even,
m(vk , a) ≥ 1 if v0 = vk and |W | is odd.
Note that any closed walk W of even length whose edges are colored with a and
b alternately is an ab-alternating walk. If G is given a partial f -coloring and
W is an ab-alternating walk in G, then interchanging the colors a and b of the
edges in walk W yields another partial f -coloring of G. This operation is called
switching W . When W is switched, m(vi , a) and m(vi , b) remain as they were if
i = 0, k, while m(v0 , b) ≥ 1 if W is not a closed walk of even length. We denote
by W (a, b; v0 ) an ab-alternating walk which starts with vertex v0 .
(2) Fan Sequences
Let e0 = wv0 be an uncolored edge of G. Then a f an F is a sequence of distinct
edges e0 , e1 , . . . , ek incident with the vertex w such that there is a sequence of
distinct colors α0 , α1 , . . . , αk−1 satisfying the following conditions (a) and (b),
where w is called the pivot of F , vi (0 ≤ i ≤ k) is the end of ei other than w
and c(e) is the color assigned to the edge e.
(a) αi ∈ M (vi ), 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1;
(b) c(ei ) = αi−1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
When G is a simple graph, vertices v0 , v1 , . . . , vk are distinct. Shif ting a f an F
means to recolor ei with αi for each i, 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, and erase the color αk−1
of ek . If G is given a partial f -coloring, then shifting F yields another partial

A Class of Graphs of f -Class 1

367

f -coloring of G in which ek instead of e0 is uncolored. A maximal f an is the
one whose length k cannot be increased.
Lemma 3. Let C denote the set of colors available to color the edges of a simple
graph G. Suppose that e0 = wv0 is an uncolored edge in G, and graph G − {e0 }
is f -colored with the colors in C now. If every neighbor v of either w or v0 has
M (v) = ∅, then we can f -color e0 with a color in C.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that all neighbors v of w have
M (v) = ∅. If M (w) ∩ M (v0 ) = ∅, clearly e0 can be f -colored with a color in
M (w) ∩ M (v0 ). Otherwise, construct a fan F = e0 , e1 , . . . , em with a sequence of
distinct colors α0 , α1 , . . . , αm−1 . If M (w) ∩ M (vi ) = ∅ for some i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m},
then there exists a color γ ∈ M (w) ∩ M (vi ) such that γ is available at vertices
w and vi . By shifting the subfan F = e0 , e1 , . . . , ei and subsequently coloring
ei with γ, we f -color e0 with a color in C. Thus one can assume that M (w) ∩
M (vi ) = ∅ for all i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m}. Furthermore, assume that F is a maximal
fan. Obviously, F has M (vm ) ⊆ {α0 , α1 , . . . , αm−1 }.
Let β ∈ M (w) and αm ∈ M (vm ). With the assumptions above, F does
not have a β-edge and has exactly one αm (= αj )-edge ej+1 , 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1.
Note that α0 , α1 , . . . , αm−1 are all distinct. Thus any αm β-alternating walk P =
W (αm , β; vm ) of G passes through none of edges of F except for the αm -edge
ej+1 . We consider four cases depending on the end vertex of P .
Case 1. If P ends at v ∈ V (G) \ {w, vj , vm }, then switch P and subsequently
shift F = e0 , e1 , . . . , em . Since β becomes an available color at both ends of the
uncolored edge em = wvm , we can color em with β.
Case 2. If P ends at w, then switch P and subsequently shift the subfan F =
e0 , e1 , . . . , ej . Since αm = αj becomes an available color at both ends of the
uncolored edge ej = wvj , we can color ej with αm .
Case 3. If P ends at vj , then switch P and subsequently shift the subfan F =
e0 , e1 , . . . , ej . Since β becomes an available color at both ends of the uncolored
edge ej = wvj , we can color ej with β.
Case 4. If P ends at vm , then P is a closed αm β-alternating walk and |P |
is odd because β ∈
/ M (vm ). Furthermore, m(vm , αm ) ≥ 2. Switching P and
subsequently shifting the fan F = e0 , e1 , . . . , em make β an available color at
both ends of the uncolored edge em = wvm . We can color em with β.
In any case, e0 can be f -colored with a color in C.
Let q(G) = maxv∈V (G) { d(v)+1
f (v) }. For any v ∈ V (G), since f (v)q(G) > d(v),
there are always M (v) = ∅. By Lemma 3, we can obtain an f -coloring of G with
q(G) colors by coloring the edges of G one by one. Hence Lemma 1 is proved.
Similarly, when V0∗ (G) = ∅, there are also M (v) = ∅ for all v ∈ V (G). Hence an
earlier result of the authors [11] can be derived from Lemma 3.
Theorem 4. [11] Let G be a simple graph. If V0∗ (G) = ∅, then G is of f -class 1.

368

X. Zhang and G. Liu

Holding above result, we only need to consider the situation with V0∗ (G) = ∅.
Now we give the main result as follows, which improves Corollary 3 on simple
graphs.
Theorem 5. Let G be a simple graph. Suppose that V0∗ (G) = ∅. If f (v) is
positive and even for all v ∈ V0∗ (G) ∪ NG (V0∗ (G)), then G is of f -class 1.
Proof. We will give an f -coloring of G with Δf (G) colors. Let C denote the set
of Δf (G) colors available to color the edges of G.
Here we denote the quasi-f -core of G by G∗ . Simply, we write E(G∗ ) as E ∗ .
First, we color the edges in E ∗ . By Corollary 3, we know that G∗ is of f -class
1. Also, by Δf (G∗ ) = Δf (G), we have χf (G∗ ) = Δf (G). Hence we can f -color
G∗ by the colors in C.
Let E ∗ = E(G) \ E ∗ . Next, we color the edges in E ∗ . Clearly, for any edge
e ∈ E ∗ , both ends of e are not in V0∗ (G). Furthermore, at least one end of e is
not in NG (V0∗ (G)). (Otherwise, e ∈ E ∗ .) That is to say, for any edge e ∈ E ∗ ,
there is at least one end of e which is not adjacent to the vertices in V0∗ (G). Note
that, for any vertex v ∈ V (G) \ V0∗ (G), we always have M (v) = ∅. Let e = wu.
Thus every neighbor v of either w or u has M (v) = 0. e can be f -colored with
a color in C by Lemma 3.
In fact, a more general suﬃcient condition can be obtained in the similar way.
Obviously, it is necessary also.
Theorem 6. Let G be a simple graph. Suppose that V0∗ (G) = ∅. G is of f -class
1 if and only if the quasi-f -core of G is of f -class 1.

Conclusion and Further Research

Let G and H be disjoint graphs. We use G + H to denote the graph with vertex
set V (G) ∪ V (H) and edge set E(G) ∪ E(H). The join G ∨ H of disjoint graphs
G and H is the graph obtained from G + H by joining each vertex of G to each
vertex of H. Let G1 be a subgraph of G. We use G − G1 to denote the graph
with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G) \ E(G1 ). If k ≥ 3 and v0 , v1 , . . . , vk−1
are distinct, then we call a closed walk v0 v1 . . . vk−1 v0 a cycle and denote it by
Ck .
In this paper, we give a new suﬃcient condition for a simple graph G to be of
f -class 1 based on vertex set V0∗ (G) ∪ NG (V0∗ (G)). We attempt to ﬁnd a more
general suﬃcient condition based on V0∗ (G). However, the condition that f (v) is
positive and even for all v ∈ V0∗ (G) is not suﬃcient for a simple graph G to be
of f -class 1. A counterexample is G = (K14 − C14 ) ∨ K1 , in which each vertex
v with d(v) = 12 has f (v) = 4 and the unique vertex w with d(w) = 14 has
f (w) = 5. It is easy to see that Δf (G) = 3 and all vertices but w belong to
V0∗ (G). Let C = {c1 , c2 , c3 }. We say that G is of f -class 2, for otherwise, there
will exist some color γ ∈ C such that the number of edges colored with γ, i.e.
(4 × 14 + 5)/2, is not an integer.

In the further research, we may try to ﬁnd new even conditions on function f
for a simple graph to be of f -class 1 based on some other special vertex subsets.
Also, we may study that which classes of simple graphs G are of f -class 1 when
f (v) is positive and even for all v ∈ V0∗ (G). In many edge-coloring problems,
some special subgraphs such as obstructions in f -colorings are rather diﬃcult
to deal with. Therefore, we often seek some techniques to avoid them. Applying
even conditions on function f to other edge-coloring problems, e.g. equitable
edge-coloring problem, maybe we can obtain some interesting results.
