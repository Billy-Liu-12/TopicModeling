Abstract. This paper is a study related to phonemic analysis of Korean speech.
For speech recognition, the best method is that speech should be recognized as
phonemic unit. However, to segment speech into phonemic units is not wellapplied because of various changes of phonation. Therefore, I in this study try
to arrange a phonemic system of Korean speech and segment speech into phonemic units on the base of the phonemic system of Hunminjeongeum, the Korean script. I also look for the features of each phoneme by observing the
changes of frequency domain, mel bandwidth and mel capstrum of phoneme
and aim to form the phonemic segmentation system of Korean speech.
Keywords: phonemic analysis, pattern recognition.

1 Introduction
This paper is a study on phonemic segmentation of speech for recognition of Korean
speech. A phoneme is the smallest unit to consist speech. Hence, speech recognition by
phonemes is much more effective and efficient than recognition of syllable or word
unit. It also can offer a basis of embodiment of the effective speech recognition system.
Therefore, I in this paper analyze Korean speech on phonemic system of Hunminjeongeum, the Korean script and also do a comparative analysis between features of
these and frequency domain, Mel frequency band, Mel cepstrum. After that, I find out
the rules that can separate Korean speech into phonemic unit by extracting phonemic
features of Korean speech.
This paper analyzes the phonemic system of hunminjeongeum in chapter2 and comparative-analyzes speech into frequency domain, Mel frequency band, and Mel cepstrum according to the phonemic system of Hunminjeongeum. Chapter 4 shows the
conclusions.

2 The System of Hunminjeongeum
Hunminjeongeum classifies speech into an initial sound, a medial vowel and a final
consonant.

2.1 The System of Initial Sound
Hunminjeongeum is the phonemic letters for phonetic representation. Initial sounds
are classified into entire-purity, second-purity, entire-impurity and no-purity-noimpurity like Table1. They are also consisted of the sounds from molar, tongue, lip,
tooth, throat, anti-tongue, and half-tooth in according to the location of speech pronounced[1]. In modern phonetics, entire-purity is classified into common-sound,
second-purity into an aspirate, entire-impurity into a fortis and no-purity-no-impurity
into sympathetic sound[2].
Table 1. System of Initial Sound

2.2 The System of Medial Vowel
A medial vowel is consisted of fundamental tone, conjunction, and wall in according
to the shape of lips when they tune. There are intermediate vowels like [Ø],[r],[j],[i]
which are developed in between initial sounds and medial vowels. And when [ ] and
[∂] are united with these intermediate vowels, next things happen; [Ø]+[ ∂]→ , [r]+
[ ∂]→ , [j]+[ ∂]→ , [i]+[ ∂]→[ ]. that's how fundamental tones, [ , , ], are
established as Table2.

If I indicate the thing that makes the shape of lips round as [w] and the thing that
makes the shape of lips open as [ų] when they tune, two phonemes which are

other two phonemes which are

2.3 The System of Final Consonant
A final consonant is that consists the rhyme of letter from receiving an initial sound
and a medial vowel. There are 8 of them; , , , , , , , . These are not
much different from 7 of ending sounds of syllables treated as phonemics in modern
phonology. Only the difference is that “ ” and “ ” can be treated the same in the
final consonant.

3 Phonemic Segmentation
3.1 Conditions
This experiment did a sampling of speech with 16kHz, 16bit, and Mono by using a
table microphone, found out the frequency through Fourier transform. And after transforming this into Mel frequency band, Mel cepstrum was gotten.
3.2 Phonemic Segmentation
Speech was divided into initial sound, medial vowel and final consonant as Table3
and each of pictures shows spectrum per frequency(F/kHz), time of pronunciation(Second), Mel Frequency band(MF/melf), Mel Cepstrum(MC) of the range of
8kHz through Fourier transform. It finds out the sum of frequencies which are transformed into Mel frequency band and establishes the sound intervals. Again it was
separated as a voiceless sound when high frequency was strong and it was separated
as a voiced sound when low frequency was strong.

3.2.1 Segmentation of Initial Sound
An initial sound is divided up into entire-purity, second-purity, entire-impurity and
no-purity-no-impurity like Figure 1 to Figure 4.

Entire-purity of initial sound forms high frequency and has little spectrum of Mel
frequency band, so it can be easily distinguished.
Second-purity( , , , , ) of initial sound is an aspirated sound and forms
comparatively longer time of high frequency. Especially “ ” has very strong frequency and little Mel spectrum, so it is easy to be distinguished
Entire-impurity(ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ) of initial sound is a fortis that except “ㅆ” has a
very short time to pronounce. However, it rapidly changes the spectrum of vowel
coming next.

No-purity-no-impurity(ㅇ, ㄴ, ㅁ, ㄹ) of initial sound is a sympathetic sound.
Here, “ㅇ” cannot have a sound of initial sound, but a sound of final consonant. It has
an echo after vowel. You can see that “ㄴ,ㅁ,ㄹ” has a change of spectrum of vowel.
3.2.2 Segmentation of Medial Vowel
A medial vowel is divided into fundamental tone, conjunction in Figure 5 and wall in
Figure 6. In Figure 5, “ , ”, the conjunction of vowels, are the shapes added central
formant to the spectrum of “ , ”, fundamental tones, and again the spectrum gets
changes when “ / ” start, then it gets stable again the forms of “ , ”.
In Figure 6, “ , ” among wall sounds keep steady spectrum, “ / ” gets
change from the beginning of “ , ” and again gets stable as forms of “ , ”.

3.2.3 Segmentation of Final Consonant
Among 8 of final consonants, “ , , , , , ,( ), ”, if I treat “ ” and “ ” as
the same sound and exclude “ ” shown in no-purity-no-impurity, then it will be as
Figure 7.
Some of final consonant, “ , , ”, are easy to be distinguished because they
form echo, but the other, “ , , ”, hardly show the form and happen to change the
spectrum of vowels as shown in Figure 7.

3.3 Speech Experiment
Figure 8 is the pronunciation of “안녕 하십니까” about for a second. In Figure 8,
vowels, (ㅏ,ㅕ,ㅏ,ㅣ,ㅣ,ㅏ), are distinguished easily like frequency and Mel

frequency band spectrum. “ㄴ” should be sensed by change of spectrum and “ㅎ” is
hardly pronounced and also gets change of spectrum like in Figure 4. “ㅅ” is showing
a certain high frequency as like in Figure 1 and “ㄲ” also gets change of spectrum as
like in Figure 3.

4 Conclusion
I in this paper analyze the features of Korean speech in according to the phonemic
system of Hunminjeongeum, the Korean script and use these features to divide speech
and feature of each phoneme by using the sum of Mel cepstrum through frequency
domain, Mel frequency band and DCT(Discrete Cosine Transform) transform and
spectrum transformed into Mel frequency band.
Phonemes of initial sound forms high frequency or changes the spectrum and medial vowels keep the steady spectrum after changing from the fundamental tones or
change the spectrum. Vowels especially can be distinguished because they keep a
certain form with spectrum. Sympathetic sounds of final consonants can be distinguished because they form echo but the others can be distinguished by sensing change
of spectrum.
Therefore, if there is a further study on phoneme of speech that is weakened or omitted when the sound is prolonged, it will bring more accurate phonemic segmentation.
