Abstract. The rapid growth of the Internet technology has encouraged
organizations to protect their information assets. Furthermore, the need for risk
analysis has become very important for organizations. However, the existing
risk analysis just presents the guidelines that can be used to determine the
security measures but do not support how to evaluate the risks quantitatively.
Therefore, in this paper, the quantitative risk evaluation model based on the
Markov process, especially for the case of interrelated threats, is proposed. In
addition, in order to analyze the relationship between threats, the basic analysis
method using the covariance and the correlation coefficient is presented.

1 Introduction
The Internet is growing in popularity exponentially due to its ease of use and the
powerful ability to support information services. Furthermore, as dependency of
network technology on large-scale critical infrastructure increases, the cyber attacks
have also increased, targeted against vulnerable assets in information systems. Hence,
in order to protect private information and computer resources, research relating to
risk analysis is required. Risk analysis involves determining what you need to protect,
what you need to protect it from, and how to protect it. It is the process of examining
all of your risks, then ranking those risks by level of severity. This process involves
making cost-effective decisions on what you want to protect [1]. Precise risk analysis
provides several advantages such as supporting practical security policies for
organizations by monitoring and effectively protecting the critical assets of the
organization, and providing valuable analysis data for future estimation through the
development of secure information management [2]. There is considerable research
relating to risk analysis [3,4]. However, the existing risk analysis just presents the
guidelines that can be used to determine the security measures but do not support how
to evaluate the risks clearly. Furthermore, the existing risk propagation models are

inadequate in applying this to the analysis of attacks caused by diverse threats in
information systems. That is, the existing models can only be applied to specific
threats such as virus or worm. In addition, it is difficult to holistically analyze the risk
propagation caused by these threats, using the relationship among the threats.
Therefore, in our previous work [5], a probabilistic model for damage propagation
based on the Markov process [6, 7], was proposed, based on historical data, occurring
over several years. Using the proposed model, the occurrence probability and
occurrence frequency for each threat in information systems can be predicted
holistically, and applied to establish countermeasures against those threats. However,
the previous work [5] only presented the approach method with a case study, and did
not formulate a risk propagation model for the case of interrelated threats. Therefore,
in this paper, the Markov process-based risk evaluation model, which can evaluate the
occurrence probability and occurrence frequency of threats, especially in case a threat
occurs related with other threats, is proposed. In addition, in order to analyze the
relationship between threats, the basic analysis method using the covariance and the
correlation coefficient is presented.
The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 presents
the overview of security risk analysis model, and the Markov process-based risk
analysis model. In Section 3, a case study to show the creation of the model,
especially a threat occurs related with other threats, is presented. Finally, Section 4
concludes this paper.

2 Overview of Security Risk Analysis Model
Security analysis model presented in our previous work [2] is composed of 4 steps:
Domain analysis, risk analysis, risk mitigation and effectiveness evaluation, and
damage estimation and reporting results. In Step 1, the types of assets, threats, and
vulnerabilities for the organization are analyzed. Step 2 evaluates the security risk of
the system by summing up all the risks of system components with considering the
existing threats in the core assets of the organization and the degree of vulnerabilities
per threat. Step 3 is a process that shows the lists of current security countermeasure
in the organization, and selects suitable mitigation methods against the threats, then
show the effectiveness of the mitigation method. Finally, Step 4 summarizes the
initial risks, the types and cost of the risk mitigation methods, the residual security
risks, and their Return-On-Investment (ROI). In this paper, Step 2, risk analysis is
focused, especially in case of evaluating security risk quantitatively. Therefore, in
order to evaluate the risk, following equations are used:
RISK = Loss × Probability
LOSS = Asset-Value × Damage
DAMAGE = 1-((1-Threat-Rate) × (1-Vulnerability-Rate))

(1)
(2)
(3)

RISK means a damage amount when assets are damaged by threats in a vulnerable
system. It is calculated in Step 2. As a result, risk is calculated as multiplication of
LOSS, which means the degree of shrinkage in the asset-value caused by threats, and
the probability, which is the probability of threat-occurrence. An asset is a set of

1042

items, which have economic value owned by an individual or organization in
information systems. Examples are information or data, documents, hardwares,
softwares, and so on. DAMAGE is a probability that is damaged by attacks. It is
evaluated by threat-rate, which is potential probability of threat-occurrence, and
vulnerability-rate, which is the degree of a weakness in an information system, system
security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited. The
threat and vulnerability rate range from 0 to 1. In this paper, the focus is on
calculating the probability in equation (1), and threat-occurrence, in particular, when
threat occurs releated with other threats.
The Markov process-based risk propagation model proposed in the previous work
[5] is composed of 4 steps: Threat-State Definition, Threat-state Transition Matrix,
Initial Vector, and Risk Propagation Evaluation. In Step 1, all kinds of threat are
examined, the threat-occurrence data are collected and analyzed in global systems,
and finally the possible threat-states are defined. In Step 2, the threat-state transition
matrix is calculated, which is a square matrix describing the probabilities of moving
from one threat-state to another. In order to obtain the transition matrix, the following
two tasks are performed. First, threat-states are listed by mapping the threatoccurrence data of each threat into the threat-state defined in the previous step.
Second, the number from one threat-state to another is counted, allowing the matrix to
finally be constructed. In Step 3, the initial probability is calculated against the
occurrence of threat-state. Finally, in Step 4, the probability and frequency of threatoccurrence using the threat-state transition matrix and the initial vector calculated in
the previous steps are estimated. A more detailed description of the Markov processbased, risk propagation model can be found in Kim et al. [5].

3 Case Study
In this section, a case study that presents how to make the risk propagation model,
especially in case a threat occurs related with other threats, is presented. As in the
previous work [5], in this case study, the statistics of hacking and virus published by
the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA) [8] for 60 months is used from
January 2001 to December 2005, for trust in the historical data.
First, threat-occurrence data is gathered and analyzed, and priority is given to
threats. After this step, the frequency and statistics of threat for each month is
obtained, as presented in Table 1, 2 and 3.

Threat T1 is an Illegal intrusion using malicious applications such as Netbus and
Subseven as one of the hacking threats in information system. This threat leaks
information and interrupts the normal process in information systems. Threat T2 is an
Internet Worm as one of virus threats. The Internet worm is a self-replicating
computer program or executable program with rapid propagation itself. Recently this
threat occurs frequently, and much research relating to the propagation of the Internet
worm is processing. Threat T3 is a Network Eavesdrop as one of scanning detection.
The network eavesdropping is an attack based on sniffing the network.
As mentioned previously, in this case study, a threat occurs related with other
threats. Therefore the relationship between threats must be analyzed before estimation
of risks. In order to analyze degree of the relationship, the covariance (Cov) [6, 9] and
the correlation coefficient [6, 9] are used. Cov measures the degree of correlation
between the random variables, and is defined by
Cov( X , Y ) = E ( XY ) − E ( X ) E (Y )

(4)

where E(X) is a expectation of the variable X. If Cov ( X , Y ) is zero, this means that
X and Y are uncorrelated. The correlation coefficient ρ ( X , Y ) evaluates the
coherence of relationship between X and Y as formula (5), and satisfies the formula
(6).

ρ ( X ,Y ) =

As presented formula (7), especially when the ρ ( X , Y ) is zero, the variables X and
Y are uncorrelated. In case ρ ( X , Y ) is closed to -1, if X increases, Y decreases.
Conversely, if ρ ( X , Y ) is closed to 1, when X increases, Y also increases. In this
case study, degree of the relationship among the threats T1, T2, and T3 can be analyzed
using formula (5) as follows:

ρ (T1 , T2 ) =

Cov (T1 , T2 )
Cov (T1 , T2 )
=

ρ (T2 , T3 ) =

Cov (T2 , T3 )
Cov (T2 , T3 )

σ T2 σ T3
Var[T2 ]Var[T3 ]

From above results, it is sure that threats T2 and T3 have a closer relationship than
others. That is, Internet worm T2 can be sure to a little influence an occurrence of
network eavesdrop T3, and vice versa. On the contrary, threats T1 and T2 are
uncorrelated. That is, illegal intrusion using malicious application T1 give little
influence an occurrence of Internet worm T2, and vice versa. Although, in this paper,
the relationship of only three threats T1, T2 and T3 are analyzed, diverse threats in
information systems can be analyzed and ranked using the Cov and correlation
coefficient.
In order to evaluate the relationship among the threats, the threat-states should be
created by a combination of a number of threat thresholds. In order to demonstrate
this, the data depicted in Table 1 and 2 are used for T1 and T2. It is assumed that all
threats have the same environments such as countermeasures, system resource and so
on, whenever threats occur. In order to define threat-states, the thresholds of each
threat are first defined using the analysis of the frequency data presented in Table 1
and 2. The thresholds of the each threat can be defined in the formulas (8) and (9):
z
z

Thresholds of T1 := H1: 0~400, H2: 401~800, H3: 801~1200
Thresholds of T2 := W1: 0~4000, W2: 4001~8000, W3: Over 8001

(8)
(9)

As mentioned above, when a threat occurs that is related to other threats, the threatstates are defined as combination of thresholds of many threats. Therefore the nine
number of threat-state as follows are defined:
S = {S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9}

(10)

Where S1=(H1, W1), S2=(H1, W2), S3=(H1, W3), S4=(H2, W1), S5=(H2, W2), S6=(H2,
W3), S7=(H3, W1), S8=(H3, W2), and S9=(H3, W3)
In order to define the threat-state, a pair of threat-occurrence data of T1 and T2
presented in Table 1 and 2 is listed as follows:
(85, 1), (125, 1529), (70, 2429), (89, 684), (64, 520), (65, 6106), ... , (76,
662), (254, 620), (42, 444), (40, 637), (22, 705), (16, 620)

Quantitative Risk Analysis and Evaluation in Information Systems: A Case Study

1045

Next, the threat-occurrence pair is mapped into the thresholds of each threat
defined in (8) and (9), and listed as follows:
(H1, W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1), ... , (H1, W1), (H1,
W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1), (H1, W1)
Each pair of (Hi, Wi) is mapped into the threat-state defined in (10), and listed as
follows:
S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S2, S5, S3, S2, S2, S1, S4, S1, S1, S1, S1, S4, S1, S1, S1, S4,
S4, S7, S7, S4, S7, S7, S1, S4, S1, S6, S3, S1, S3, S3, S2, S2, S4, S2, S6, S3, S3, S3,
S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1, S1
From the above threat-states listing, the transition number from a threat (S1~S9) is
counted for other threats, and the transition matrix is made as follows:

From the threat-state transition matrix, and the entries of transition matrix, the
transition from a threat-state to another, satisfy formula that the row of transition
matrix adds to one. Furthermore, the threat-state transition matrix can be translated
into a threat-state diagram, as depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Threat-State Diagram for T1 and T2

In order to calculate the initial probability for T1 and T2, the most recent data
covering six months are used, from July 2005 to December 2005. Furthermore, the
initial probability is calculated:

= (0.78 0.03 0.03 0.13 0 0.03 0 0 0)

From above result, the probability of threat-occurrence of T1 and T2 can be
expected. That is, each threat-state from S1 to S9 can occur with the probability 0.78,
0.03, 0.03, 0.13, 0, 0.03, 0, 0, and 0 in good order. Consequently it can be conformed
that the state S1 (that is, a threshold of (H1, W1)) has the highest probability of threatoccurrence, that T1 will occur with the number between 0 and 400, and T2 will occur
with the number between 0 and 4000. Furthermore, to estimate the exact frequency of
threat-occurrence, which would occur in the future, the probability of threatoccurrence calculated in (13) is used and the medians M(Hi) for T1 and M(Wi) for T2.
In this case study, in order to calculate the median, the frequency of threat-occurrence
of the previous month is used. M(Hi) and M(Wi) can be calculated as follows:
z
z

Median for T1: M(H1)= 16, M(H2)= 0, M(H3)= 0
Median for T2: M(W1)= 620, M(W2)= 0, M(W3)= 0

Before the frequency of threat-occurrence is calculated, the probability of
thresholds must be calculated against each threat as follows:
z
z

Probability of threshold for T1: P(H1)= 0.84 , P(H2)= 0.16, P(H3)= 0
Probability of threshold for T2: P(W1)= 0.91, P(W2) = 0.03, P(W3)= 0.06

The Expected Frequency (EF) of threat-occurrence for each threat T1 and T2, can
be calculated using formula (10) in [5], where n is 3 as follows:
3

EF of T1 = ∑ P( Hi )M ( Hi ) = 0.81× 16 ≅ 14
i =1

1047

3

EF of T2 = ∑ P(Wi )M (Wi ) = 0.88 × 620 ≅ 561
i =1

From the above result, the frequency of threat-occurrence of T1 can be predicted at
approximately 14 and that of T2 is approximately 561.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, a probabilistic model of risk propagation based on the Markov process,
which can estimate the spread of risk when attacks occur from not only virus or
worms but also diverse threats, was presented briefly. Furthermore, a case study that
especially a threat occurs related with other threats was presented using reliable
historical data from the KISA, and the relationship among the threats was analyzed
using the covariance and the correlation coefficient. The proposed model in this paper
has different advantages from existing models: The proposed model estimates the
probability or frequency of threat-occurrence unlike the worm or virus propagation
model, which obtains the number of damaged systems, in particular, the number of
infected computers in the system. This probabilistic approach can be applied to
diverse kinds of threats in information systems. Therefore the threats can be analyzed
synthetically with an analysis of the relationship among the threats.
