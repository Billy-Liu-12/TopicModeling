Abstract. The iteration is a fundamental characteristic of the complex developing process. The developing mission of new product, during the quick response
manufacturing process, will be iterated step by step following certain probability rules at the work nodes. Based on the analysis of the development mission
process, the method of the multi-stages, finite state Markov process is presented
to describe the system process. The models of the mission reliability for both
task stages and system have then been built. Finally, the quantitative methods of
mission reliability calculation were explained in details through the analysis of
an actual developing process. The methods can also be used to evaluate the development system.
Keywords: Quick response manufacturing system(QRMS), Design iteration,
Mission reliability.

1 Introduction
The Quick Response Manufacturing System (QRMS) is based on the quick response
concept with the purpose to quick response to the demand for developing new products
and carry out the design and manufacturing process in a very timely manner. The frequent changing of market demand requires higher competence of new product development. On one hand, companies need to analyze its current development & manufacturing
system to estimate, from the perspective of mission reliability, system’s ability to finish
the task in the required time period. On the other hand, companies may also need to improve on those weaknesses that pertain to the system therefore increase its competence of
development.
Iteration and conflict of resource are the most two important factors in an estimation
of the mission reliability for a QRMS. Iteration is a basic characteristic of the complex
development process[1, 2]. The iteration processes means rework and improve on previous work and that always leads to risk of scheduling and repeated planning and eventually make the whole developing process delayed. The fast changing demand of market
gets the QRMS overloaded and that means a task always has to queue in the process due
to the lack of resource. Hence, the task cannot be finished on time and companies will
suffer loss.
Currently, Design structure Matrix[3] (DSM) are widely used for the time evaluation of product development process. DSM has been extended to the numerical DSM,

which can further describe the iteration relation among different developing processes. In DSM, probability of rework indicates the possible rework of the whole developing process. However, the scenario derived from DSM that the probability of
rework is a constant does not reflect the actual operating rule. Therefore, this paper
extends the probability of rework scenario by taking the changing probability of rework during different task developing stages into account.
The conflict of recourse in the developing process can be better reflected using the
model of queuing network. Meanwhile, the transferring matrix of queuing network
can be related to the matrix derived from DSM. Hence, the queuing network model
has greater applicability as during the developing process. The paper analyzes the task
developing process of quick response manufacturing system and describes the dynamic probability of rework by adopting multi-stages, finite states Markov process.
The paper finally figures out the analytical model and arithmetic for task reliability
calculation by analyzing and modelling those probabilities using queuing network.
The following cases further show how arithmetic works.

2 Problem Formulation
Suppose there are M nodes in a QRMS and each division has one workgroup. The
service time for each workgroup follows exponential distributions with parameter μi

( i = 1, 2,3...N ) . Additional predetermined assumptions are:

1. Those tasks that have been undertaken by the system are homogeneous. The arrival process is Poisson with arrival rate λ . The tasks arrive at the first node from
outside and finish all the service work in the order of the nodes. When task arrives,
the idle workgroup reacts immediately while others keep waiting on a queue. Services
at all nodes are independent and the number of queues at each node is limitless.
2. In a task developing process, the reworks exist and are allocated in each node
following certain probability. When a task is first finished at node i , it can only be
returned to node (1, 2,L , i − 1) if any rework occurred.
3. Followed by the proceeding of a task among nodes, the probability of rework
will change because new information arrives.

Set X = t N( )+1 = ∑ X I , T indicates the given time to finish the task. The system’s

mission reliability can be defined as:

R ( X ) = P[ X ≤ T ]
Definition 5:
The task will enter the second node directly after reaching the first node at first time
and being finished at this node. That is, there is no rework in the first stage, symbolized as Ρ1 = [ 0] . While in the stage I ( I = 2,L , M ) , the rework at different nodes
can be illustrated by the following matrix:

⎡ r11 ( I ) K r1i ( I ) ⎤
Ρ I = ⎢⎢ M
O
M ⎥⎥
⎢⎣ ri1 ( I ) L rii ( I ) ⎥⎦

(2)

rij ( I ) : The probability of task being reworked from the first node i to node j

( 0 < i, j ≤ I )

when task has been processed in stage I .

3.2 The Single Task Process Modelling
The development process is shown in Fig. 1. It is known from the definition that under the system discussed in this paper, the rework of a task can only happen among
the nodes which have been serviced already. Further, the probability of rework is
changing upon the task being processed forward. This paper then puts forward a
measure called Multistage, Finite-state, absorbing Markov chains for system modelling and analyzing.

given that the matrix β I = βij = ( Ρ I - e ) is invertible square matrix. (Throughout this paper, e will denote the column vector with all components equal to one,
whose length is determined by the context in which it appears.), Without regard to the
waiting time taken in the queue at nodes, it can be shown from Eq. (3) that the finitestate, absorbing Markov Chains has been constructed during the process of the task
from node i to note ( i + 1)′ . The initial state of the process is ( α I , α I +1 ) , where

α I = ( 0,L , 0,1)1x I . The set of states is 1,..., i, ( i + 1)′ . Among that the state

(1, 2,L , i )

are all transient, state ( i + 1)′ is absorbing. Before the process absorbed to

the state ( i + 1)′ , the mean visit times to each node can be described as the vector[4]:

3.3 Steady-State System Development Process Model
3.3.1 Steady-State Mean Arrival Rate of Each Node
From assumption we can know that the arrivals of tasks follow independent, exponentially distributed interarrival times with rate λ . The task service time at each node
also follows exponentially distributed interarrival times with rate μi . Under steady
state, every node in the queuing network can be viewed as a M / M /1 queuing system. Thus, the arrival rate of a task entering quick response manufacturing system,
under steady state, must equalize its departure rate. Assume that total mean arrival

206

rate (the sum of the arrival rate from outside and those from other nodes to node i ) is

：

Λ i at node i , then
Theorem 1. under steady state, the total mean arrival rate of each node is

2,L , N )
( j = 1，

N

Λ j = λ ∑ kI ( j )
I =1

(5)

Proof: Under steady state, the jobs at node j come from every stage in the whole task
process. From Eq.(4), in the task stage I , the mean times for task visiting node
j ( j = 1, 2,L , i ) is k I ( j ) , therefore, under steady state, the sum of the mean times
N

for task to come from every stage visiting node j is

∑k ( j) .
I =1

I

From model assume: the task stage is the sequence, the task from outside to the
first node in the system follows the Poisson process with parameters λ , and the other
nodes haven’t got any input from outside. Then the steady-state overall arrival rate at
node j ( j = 1, 2,L , N ) can be written as:
N

Λ j = λ ∑ kI ( j )
I =1

( j = 1, 2,L, N )

The theorem has then been proved.
3.3.2 Steady-State Response Time Distribution Wi ( t ) of Node i
When the utilization ρi of the node i meets:

ρi =

queueing network will leave the steady-state distribution, which the marginal
queue length distribution of every node at the queueing networks is the same as that
of the M / M /1 queueing system[5]. Then the distribution of steady-state response
time (the sum of the waiting time and the server time) at node i ( i = 1, 2,L , N ) is:

Wi ( t ) = P [Vi ≤ t ] = Ε ⎡⎣ P [Vi ≤ t ] N = ni ⎤⎦ = 1 − e

− ( μi −Λi ) t

, t≥0

(7)

From Eq.(7), the steady-state distribution at node i is exponentially distribution
with parameters:
λi = μi − Λ i

Where, α I = ( 0,L , 0,1)1x I , TI = (Tk j ) = λi βij , βij is the matrix element defined
by the Eq.(4).
Proof: From Eq.(8), the steady-state distribution at every node is exponentially distribution. Therefore, in stage I , the process constructed in the 2.2 section was a finitestate Markov process with generator:

is non-singular. It has negative diago-

nal elements and nonnegative off-diagonal elements and satisfies TI e + TI 0 = 0 . The

initial state of the process is ( α I , α I +1 ) , where α I = ( 0,L , 0,1)1x I . Then the absorbing time distribution of Markov process follows the Phase-Type(PH) distribution. The
distribution function is

：

FI ( t ) = P [t ≤ TI ] = 1 − α I exp [ TI t ] e, t ≥ 0
Where, TI was the given time to finish the task at stage I .
From Definition 3, it is proved that RI ( t ) = FI ( t ) .

3.4.2 Mission Reliability Model of the System
From Definition 3, X I ( i = 1, 2,L , N ) was defined as the actual task serving time at
stage I , and based on the system hypothesis, X I is non-negative independent random

variables, and the total time of a task X = ∑ X I , then the total service time distribuI =1

tion of a task is the convolution of the service time distribution of each task stage.
The convolution of the limited number of PH distribution is also the PH distribution[4]. It is obviously that it is the finite process for a task in QRMS. The total service
time distribution of a task also follows the PH distribution denoted as ( γ , L ) , then
the mission reliability of the system

R ( t ) = P [t ≤ T ] = 1 − γ exp [ Lt ] e, t ≥ 0

From Fig. 2, it is known that under the same requirement for mission reliability,
the task in the third stage takes the longest time to be finished, that is, it takes the
longest time for a task being processed from node 3 to node 4. Therefore, the third
stage is the bottleneck for the whole mission. Table 2 shows the average waiting time
at node 3 is 52.029h. Such long time being taken is mainly due to the reworks caused
by design iteration. Hence the designer can consider some measures to reduce the
design failure and improve the level of system’s mission reliability level. Possible
measures are: the increase of design quality control; more training for designing staff,
and so on.

5 Conclusion
By analyzing the mission reliability for the QRMS, a model has been built to reflect
such mission reliability under dynamic iteration and conflict of resource. Consequently, a quantitative solution has been given to calculate those mission reliabilities
for each stage and for the whole system. Both the model and solution give an effective tool to evaluate the mission reliability of quick response manufacturing. They
also facilitate the discovery of system’s weaknesses and give great help to improve
those weaknesses.
