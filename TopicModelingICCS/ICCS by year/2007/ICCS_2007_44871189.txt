Abstract. A Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) methodology is developed for evaluation of ﬂuid-thermal systems wherein a
complete speciﬁcation of the boundary conditions is not known a priori
and experimental diagnostics are restricted to a limited region of the
ﬂowﬁeld. The Closed Loop formulation of DDDAS is used whereby experiment and simulation are synergized in an iterative manner to determine the unknown boundary conditions, thereby enabling a full simulation (and hence, evaluation) of the ﬂuid-thermal system. In this DDDAS
methodology, the experiment directs the simulation and vice-versa. The
DDDAS methodology is applied to a heated jet injected into a laminar
boundary layer where the jet temperature and velocity are not known a
priori for the simulations. The DDDAS methodology accurately determines the unknown jet temperature and velocity.

Introduction

In a wide range of ﬂuid-thermal systems, there is typically limited access to
the ﬂow domain for experimental measurements of the ﬂowﬁeld (e.g., pressure,
species concentration, temperature and velocity). Examples of such systems include combustors, furnaces and reactors. For example, an optical ﬁber drawing
furnace typically has an infrared sensor to monitor the temperature of the heating element at a single location [1]. Consequently, the necessary boundary conditions (e.g., inﬂow, outﬂow, solid boundary, etc) for computational simulations
(using a Computational Fluid Dynamics [CFD] code such as Fluent c ) are not
completely known, and therefore a simulation cannot be performed.
The objective of this research is the development of a Dynamic Data Driven
Applications Systems methodology that synergizes experiment and simulation in
ﬂuid-thermal systems to determine the unknown boundary conditions, thereby
enabling a complete simulation of the ﬂuid-thermal system.

March 2000 [2] and further described by Darema [3] (see also the DDDAS webpage [4]). DDDAS is a unique approach to engineering and scientiﬁc research
wherein experiment and simulation interact in a synergistic, symbiotic manner.
There are two diﬀerent implementations of DDDAS: Open Loop and Closed
Loop. In Open Loop, experimental data is streamed into the simulation (or
vice-versa) to achieve greater accuracy, detail and/or robustness. An example is
the Dynamic Data Driven Wildﬁre Modeling methodology of Mandel et al [5]
and Douglas et al [6]. In Closed Loop, experiment and simulation interact in
an iterative manner, i.e., the experiment guides the simulation and the simulation in turn guides the experiment [3]. An example is the Dynamic Data Driven
Optimization Methodology (DDDOM) developed by Knight et al [7,8].

Description of Research
Objective

The objective is the development of a DDDAS methodology for synergizing
experiment and simulation to evaluate ﬂuid-thermal systems wherein the experimental measurements are restricted in region and scope, and the a priori
boundary conditions for simulation are incomplete. The Closed Loop DDDAS
concept is used wherein the experiment directs the simulation and vice-versa
in an iterative manner. The strategy is to approximate the unknown boundary
conditions by minimizing the error in the prediction of the measured data (i.e.,
the experiment driving the simulation), and to identify needed subsequent experimental measurements to reduce the error (i.e., the simulation driving the
experiment) and also subsequent additional simulations to reduce the error (i.e.,
the experiment driving the simulation).
3.2

Conﬁguration

We consider a rectangular jet injected perpendicular to an incompressible laminar boundary layer. The conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 1. The inﬂow is an
equilibrium laminar boundary layer in air deﬁned by the speciﬁed freestream
conditions (velocity U∞ , static pressure p∞ and static temperature T∞ ) and
boundary layer thickness δ∞ (i.e., the laminar boundary layer thickness that
would exist at the location of the jet exit in the absence of the jet). The jet is
deﬁned by the jet average velocity Uj , static pressure pj , and static temperature Tj . The computational domain ABCDE is shown. For the simulations, the
freestream conditions (velocity U∞ , static pressure p∞ , static temperature T∞
and boundary layer thickness δ∞ ) are assumed known. By analogy to the optical
ﬁber furnace, the jet average velocity Uj and static temperature Tj are assumed
unknown (insofar as the simulations are concerned), while the jet exit pressure pj
is assumed known. The objective is the determination of the jet average velocity
Uj and static temperature Tj based upon a Closed Loop DDDAS methodology. The range of values for Uj and Tj provided to the DDDAS methdology are
indicated in Table 1 (see Section 3.7).

Experiments

The experiments were performed in the Rutgers Low Speed Wind Tunnel. The
experimental conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 2a. A two-dimensional slot jet protrudes from a ﬂat plate with the jet centerline at a distance of 188 mm from
the leading edge of the plate. The ﬂat plate has a sharp leading edge and is
raised 50 mm above the wind tunnel ﬂoor to avoid the tunnel ﬂoor boundary
layer. The jet slot width is 3.2 mm and the spanwise depth is 545 mm. The jet
fences protrude 8.8 mm above the ﬂat plate and each fence is 6.4 mm wide in
the x-direction. The jet exit temperature was measured by a small bead thermocouple at the jet exit and was observed to vary less than 2% across the jet
exit. Additional details are presented in Knight et al [9].
A diode laser system was used to measure the time-varying absorbance across
the ﬂowﬁeld in the spanwise direction at selected locations. The measured laser
absorbance is related to the local thermodynamic conditions and gas concentrations through the spectral absorption coeﬃcient and Beer’s law

where kv = SφP , S is the temperature dependent linestrength (cm2 -cm−1 ), φ
is the lineshape function (1/cm−1 ), P is the partial pressure of the absorbing
species given in terms of number density (cm−3 ), and L is the path length (cm).
The spectrally-dependent absorbance was converted from the time domain to
the wavelength domain using laser calibration tuning curves. The current injection versus wavelength tuning was determined using an optical spectrum analyzer prior to performing the experiments. The spectrally-dependent absorbance
(kn ) can be integrated versus wavelength to remove the eﬀect of the lineshape

function. The integrated absorbance (k) only depends on the linestrength and
number density of absorbers. The temperature dependency of both quantities is
known, and therefore the path-averaged temperature can be obtained from the
absorption data. Further details are presented in Ma et al [10].
3.4

Simulations

The two-dimensional, laminar, unsteady Navier-Stokes equations were solved
using Fluent c . The ﬂuid is air. The Incompressible Ideal Gas Law was used
together with the Boussinesq approximation. The molecular dynamic viscosity
was modeled using Sutherland’s Law. The simulations are second-order accurate
in space and time. The spatial reconstruction is 3rd order MUSCL, and the
temporal integration is Implicit Dual-Time Stepping. Twenty inner time steps
at a speciﬁed inner Courant number of ﬁve are used per outer (physical) time
step. A constant outer timestep Δt = 4 · 10−4 sec was used for all simulations
corresponding to an outer Courant number CF L = ΔtU∞ /Δxmin = 4 to 8 for
the range 4 m/s ≤ U∞ ≤ 8 m/s considered in this study. Further details are
presented in Knight et al [9]. Table 1 summarizes the range of parameters for
the simulations.
3.5

Validation

A validation study was performed to assess the accuracy of the simulations
by comparison with experiment. Details are presented in Knight et al [9]. An
experiment was performed with U∞ = 4 m/s, T∞ = 299 K, p∞ = 101 kPa,
Uj = 8.11 m/s, Tj = 398 K and pj = 101 kPa. The mean temperature was
measured at three locations in the ﬂowﬁeld downstream of the jet using the diode
laser absorbance method (Section 3.3) and thermocouple. The freestream and jet
pressure, temperature and velocity conditions were provided to the simulation

using Fluent c . The computed mean temperature at the three locations within
the ﬂowﬁeld agreed with the experimental mean temperature within 10 K. This
represents also the uncertainty in the experimental measurement.
3.6

Response Surface Models

The energy equation is decoupled from the mass and momentum equations (neglecting variations in density and buoyancy eﬀects), and thus the static temperature behaves as a passive scalar. The temperature ﬁeld must therefore scale as
T (x, y, t) − T∞ = (Tj − T∞ )f (x, y, t; Uj , U∞ ). Therefore, a quadratic Response
Surface Model (RSM) for the time mean static temperature Tm (x, y) may be
constructed at a ﬁxed position (x, y) in the ﬂowﬁeld according to
Tm (x, y) − T∞ = (Tj − T∞ ) βo (x, y) + β1 (x, y)

Uj
U∞

+ β2 (x, y)

The coeﬃcients βi (x, y) are obtained from simulations performed for a ﬁxed
value Tj − T∞ (selected from the range indicated in Table 1) and a set of Uj
selected from the range indicated in Table 1 For this study, the values Uj = 4,
6 and 8 m/s were selected. The freestream conditions (U∞ , T∞ , p∞ ) and jet
pressure pj are ﬁxed as indicated in Table 1.
3.7

DDDAS Methodology

The Closed Loop DDDAS methodology integrates experiment and simulation
in a synergistic, iterative manner to achieve a complete evaluation of the ﬂuidthermal system. There are ﬁve steps:
1. Select Monitor Locations for Simulations
A set Ss of monitor locations for the simulations is selected. At each monitor
location, a time series of the static temperature is obtained in every simulation. The number of monitor locations can be arbitrarily large and is limited
only by available disk storage for the time series data. A total of eighteen
monitor locations were selected (Table 2).
2. Generate Response Surface Model Based on Simulations for Fixed ΔTji
A ﬁxed value of ΔTji = Tji −T∞ (i = 1, 2, . . .) is chosen from within the range
of values indicated in Table 1. Simulations are performed for a set of values
Uj for the ﬁxed ΔTji and time series at each of the monitor locations in Ss
is recorded. A Response Surface Model for the mean static temperature Tm
at each monitor location is generated based upon the assumed value of ΔTji
and selected values of Uj (see Section 3.6).
3. Select Monitor Locations for Experiments
A subset Sek of the monitor locations Ss is selected for the k th experiment
(k = 1, 2, . . .). Each experiment is performed at the same Uj and Tj ; however,
the values of Uj and Tj are not known for any of the simulations. Note that
the size of the set Sek is small compared to Ss due to the substantial amount
of time required for the experimental measurements.

4. Estimate Experimental Values for Tj − T∞ and Uj
The experimental mean temperatures are compared with the Response Surface Models to estimate the value of Tj − T∞ and Uj in the experiment (see
below).
5. Determine New Measurement Locations
The Response Surface Model is used to select the next set of monitor locations Sek+1 from Ss . Step No. 4 is repeated to provide a revised estimate of
Tj − T∞ and Uj . Based upon the estimated value of Tj − T∞ , the procedure
repeats from Step 2 until convergence of the predicted values for Uj and Tj .

The estimate of the experimental values Tj − T∞ and Uj at each step in the
procedure is obtained as follows. The square error between the experimental
mean temperature and the Response Surface Model for each possible subset of
l locations within Sek is computed as
ΔTme − ΔTj βo (x, y) + β1 (x, y)

E=

where ΔTj = Tj − T∞ , ΔTme = Tme − T∞ , and the sum is over l locations
within Sek (the minimum number for l is 2). For example, assume Sek contains
six locations and let l = 2. For each possible set of two locations from Sek , the
values of ΔTj and Uj that minimize E are determined. This yields ﬁfteen triplets
(ΔTj , Uj , E). For a given value of l, the predicted values of ΔTj and Uj , denoted
by ΔTjl and Ujl , are taken to be the triplet with the minimum E (i.e., the values
of ΔTj and Uj with the smallest square error). The procedure is repeated for all
values of l from l = 2 to n = size Sek . The estimate for the experimental value
l=n
of Tj − T∞ is the average of these values Tj − T∞ = (n − 1)−1 l=2 ΔTjl and
similarly for Uj .
3.8

Results

The Closed Loop DDDAS methodology was applied to determine the experimental Tj − T∞ and Uj . A total of eighteen monitor locations were selected (Step
1). Response Surface Models were generated for all monitor locations for an assumed value ΔTj = 66 K (Step 2). Based upon these models, six locations (Nos.

Evaluation of Fluid-Thermal Systems by DDDAS - Part II

3, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 16) from Table 2 were selected for the experiment (Step 3).
Note that the experimental Uj and Tj − T∞ were selected by the experimentalists (Q. Ma and T. Rossman) but not communicated to the person performing
the Closed Loop DDDAS Method (D. Knight) until the DDDAS method was
converged. Using the experimental mean temperature measurements at the six
locations, the estimated values ΔTj = 110 ± 16 K and Uj = 7.3 ± 1 m/s were
obtained using the Response Surface Models (Step 4). An additional set of locations for experiments was deﬁned based upon the Response Surface Models
(Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 17) (Step 5). A revised estimate ΔTj = 120 ± 16 K and
Uj = 7.1 ± 1 m/s were obtained using the Response Surface Models (Step 4).
A revised Tj − T∞ = 115 K was selected for creation of the Response Surface
Models (Step No. 2) recognizing that the value originally used (Tj − T∞ = 66 K)
was signiﬁcantly below the value predicted by the Response Surface Models.
Steps 4 and 5 were repeated using the new Response Surface Models yielding
the estimate Tj − T∞ = 105 ± 13 K and Uj = 7.1 ± 1 m/s. The actual experimental values are Tj − T∞ = 107 ± 10 K and Uj = 8.0 m/s. The predicted values
for Tj − T∞ and Uj thus agree with the experimental measurements to within
the experimental uncertainty (Section 3.5), thereby validating the Closed Loop
DDDAS methdology.

Conclusions

A methodology for evaluation of ﬂuid-thermal systems is developed based upon
the Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems approach. The methodology is
intended for ﬂuid-thermal systems where complete speciﬁcation of the boundary
conditions is not known a priori and experimental measurements are restricted
to a subregion of the ﬂuid-thermal domain. The methodology synergizes experiment and simulation in a closed-loop, iterative manner to achieve a full evaluation of the ﬂuid-thermal system. Results are presented for the conﬁguration of
a heated jet injected into a laminar boundary layer where the jet temperature is
not known a priori. The DDDAS methodology accurately predicts the unknown
jet temperature and jet velocity.
