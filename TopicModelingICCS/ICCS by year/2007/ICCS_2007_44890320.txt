Introduction

We consider ﬁnite simple graphs. Any undeﬁned notation follows that of Bondy
and Murty [2]. We use V (G), E(G), δ(G) and Δ(G) to denote the vertex set,
the edge set, the minimum degree and the maximum degree of a graph G, respectively. Let d(v) denote the degree of vertex v.
A total k-coloring of a graph G is a coloring of V (G) ∪ E(G) using k colors such that no two adjacent or incident elements receive the same color. The
total chromatic number χ (G) is the smallest integer k such that G has a total k-coloring. Total colorings were introduced by Vizing [16] and Behzad [1].
They both, independently, conjectured that χ (G) ≤ Δ(G) + μ(G) + 1 holds
for multigraphs, where μ(G) denotes the (edge) multiplicity of G. This conjecture became known as the Total Coloring Conjecture. The conjecture has been
veriﬁed for multigraphs of suﬃciently small maximum degree. Rosenfeld [13]
and Vijayaditya [15] independently proved that the total chromatic number for
multigraphs of maximum degree 3 is at most 5. Kostochka in [10,11] proved that
the total chromatic number of multigraphs of maximum degree 4 (respectively 5)
is at most 6 (respectively 7). It is also easy to see that for a bipartite multigraph
G, we have χ (G) ≤ Δ(G) + 2. For planar graphs, the conjecture only remains
open for Δ(G) = 6 [3, 20, 14].
The mapping L is said to be a total assignment for the graph G if it assigns
a list L(x) of possible colors to each element x ∈ V ∪ E. If G has a total coloring φ such that φ(x) ∈ L(x) for all x ∈ V (G) ∪ E(G), then we say that G
is total-L-colorable. Let f : V ∪ E −→ N be a function into the positive integers. We say that G is total-f -choosable if it is total-L-colorable for every total

assignment L satisfying |L(x)| = f (x) for all elements x ∈ V (G) ∪ E(G). The
list total chromatic number χl (G) of G is the smallest integer k such that G is
totally-f -choosable when f (x) = k for each x ∈ V (G) ∪ E(G). The list chromatic number χl (G) of G and the list edge chromatic number (or list chromatic
index) χl (G) of G are deﬁned similarly in terms of coloring vertices alone, or
edges alone, respectively; and so are the concepts of vertex-f -choosability and
edge-f -choosability.
List colorings were introduced by Vizing [17] and independently by Erd¨
os,
Rubin, and Taylor [6]. Probably the most well-know conjecture about list colorings is the List Coloring Conjecture which states that every (multi)graph G
is edge-χ (G)-choosable, where χ (G) is the usual chromatic index of G. This
conjecture has been proved for special cases, such as bipartite multigraphs [7],
complete graphs of odd order [8], multicircuits [19], outerplanar graphs [18], and
graphs with Δ(G) ≥ 12 which can be embedded in a surface of nonnegative
characteristic [5].
ˇ
As far as list total colorings are concerned, Juvan, Mohar and Skrekovski
[9]
posed the following conjecture which is the generalization of the Total Coloring
Conjecture:
Conjecture 1.1. χl (G) ≤ Δ(G) + μ(G) + 1, where μ(G) is the multiplicity of
G.
In [9], Juvan et al. proved that the conjecture is true for bipartite multigraphs and
mutigraphs of maximum degree 3. They also proved that the total-choosability
of a graph of maximum degree 2 is equal to its total chromatic number.
In Section 2, we show that Conjecture 1.1 is true for planar graph G with
Δ(G) ≥ 9. In Section 3, we consider planar graphs without cycles of speciﬁc
lengths and get some related results on Conjecture 1.1. In Section 4, open problems for future research are given.

Planar Graphs with Maximum Degree at Least 9

First, let us introduce some notations and deﬁnitions. Let G = (V, E, F ) be a
planar graph. A vertex v is called a k-vertex or k + -vertex if d(v) = k or d(v) ≥ k,
respectively. For f ∈ F , we use b(f ) to denote the closed boundary walk of f
and write f = [u1 u2 ...un ] if u1 , u2 , ..., un are the vertices on the boundary walk
in the clockwise order, with repeated occurrences of vertices allowed. The degree
of a face f , denoted by d(f ), is the number of edges-steps in b(f ). Note that each
cut-edge is counted twice. A k-face or a k + -face is a face of degree k or of degree
at least k, respectively. Let δ(f ) denote the minimum degree of vertices incident
with f . When v is a k-vertex, we say that there are k faces incident to v. However,
these faces are not required to be distinct, i.e., v may have repeated occurrences
on the boundary walk of an indent face. Let nk (v) or nk+ (v) denote the number
of k-faces or k + -faces incident with vertex v with repeated occurrence of faces
allowed, respectively.

Following theorem is our main result in this section.
Theorem 2.1. Let G be a planar graph with maximum degree Δ ≥ 9. Then G
is total-(Δ + 2)-choosable.
Proof. Let G = (V, E, F ) be a minimal counterexample to the theorem. Then
G has the following properties.
(a) G is connected.
and d(u) + d(v) ≤
(b) G contains no edge uv with min{d(u), d(v)} ≤ Δ+1
2
Δ + 2.
(a) is obvious. We will show (b). Suppose it does contain such edge e = uv.
Without loss of generality, let d(u) = min{d(u), d(v)}. We can list total color
G − e by the minimality of G and then erase the color on u. Thus e touches at
most (Δ+1) colors and can be colored from its list. Now u is adjacent or incident
to at most 2d(u) ≤ Δ + 1 colors and it too can be colored. This contradicts the
choice of G as a counterexample and shows that (b) holds.
It is easy to verify δ(G) ≥ 3 by (b). Let G3 be the subgraph induced by
the edges incident with the 3-vertices of G. Clearly, G3 does not contain odd
cycles by (b). Thus G3 is a bipartite graph with partite sets V1 , V2 , so that
V (G3 ) = V1 ∪ V2 and for any vertex v ∈ V1 , dG (v) = 3, for any vertex v ∈ V2 ,
dG (v) = Δ. Since G is a minimal counterexample, we have
(c) G3 contains a bipartite subgraph G = (V1 , V2 , E(G )), such that V1 = V1
and for any vertex v ∈ V1 , dG (v) = 2; for any vertex v ∈ V2 , dG (v) = 1. If
uv ∈ E(G ) and dG (u) = 3, then v is called the 3-master of u and u is called the
dependent of v.
Before prove (c), we ﬁrst show that G contains no even cycle v1 v2 ...v2t v1 such
that d(v1 ) = d(v3 ) = ... = d(v2t−1 ) = 3. Suppose it does contain such an even
cycle C. Total color all elements of G−E(C) from their lists, which is possible by
the minimality of G. Then erase the colors on v1 , v3 , ..., v2t−1 . If e is an edge of
C, then e now eﬀectively has a list L (e) with |L (e)| ≥ Δ + 2 − (2 + Δ − 1) = 2.
Thus the edges of C can be colored from their lists. Finally, if we are coloring
vertices v1 , v3 , ..., v2t−1 , then each vertex v2k−1 ∈ C, 1 ≤ k ≤ t, is now adjacent
or incident to at most 6 colors and so there is at least one color in its list that
we can give to v2k−1 . Thus we obtain the required contradiction.
The mentioned result above implies that G3 does not contain even cycles.
Thus G3 is a forest. For any component of G3 , we can select a vertex u with
dG (u) = 3 as the root of the tree. We denote edges of distance i from the root to
be at level i + 1, where i = 0, 1, ..., d, and d is the depth of tree. Since G does not
contain two adjacent 3-vertices, the distance from any leaf to the root is even. We
can select all the edges at even level to form a 3-path v1 vv2 such that dG (v) = 3
in this component. Thus we can ﬁnd a bipartite subgraph G = (V1 , V2 , E(G )),
such that V1 = V1 , for any vertex v ∈ V1 , dG (v) = 2 and for any vertex v ∈ V2 ,
dG (v) = 1. It completes the proof of (c).
Note that each 3-vertex has exactly two 3-masters and each vertex of degree
Δ can be the 3-master of at most one 3-vertex.

Since G is a planar graph, by Euler’s formula, we have

(d(f ) − 4) = −4(|V | − |E| + |F |) = −8 < 0.

Now we deﬁne the initial charge function w(x) for each x ∈ V ∪ F . Let w(x) =
w(x) < 0. The discharging method

remaining as possible. This leads to
x∈V ∪F

To prove the theorem, we are ready to construct a new charge w∗ (x) on G as
follows.
R1 : Each 3-vertex receives 12 from each of its 3-master.
R2 : Each 9+ -vertex transfer 12 to each of its incident 3-face.

R3 : Each k-vertex, where 5 ≤ k ≤ 8, transfer k−4

3-face.
Let γ(x → y) denote the amount transferred out of an element x into another
element y according to the above rules.
Clearly, w∗ (f ) = w(f ) ≥ 0 if d(f ) ≥ 4. Assume that f = [v1 v2 v3 ] is a 3face with d(v1 ) ≤ d(v2 ) ≤ d(v3 ). If d(v1 ) = 3, then d(v2 ) = d(v3 ) = Δ by (c).
So w∗ (f ) = w(f ) + 2 × 12 = 0. If d(v1 ) = 4, then d(v2 ) ≥ 8 and d(v3 ) ≥ 8.
So γ(v2 → f ) = 12 and γ(v3 → f ) = 12 . Thus w∗ (f ) = w(f ) + 2 × 12 = 0. If
d(v1 ) = 5, then d(v2 ) ≥ 7 and d(v3 ) ≥ 7. So γ(v1 → f ) = 15 , γ(v2 → f ) ≥ 37 ,
and γ(v3 → f ) ≥ 37 . Thus w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 15 + 2 × 37 > 0. If d(v1 ) = 6, then
γ(vi → f ) ≥ 13 for i = 1, 2, 3. So w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 3 × 13 = 0.
Let v be a k-vertex. If k = 3, then there are two vertices, say v1 , v2 , such
that vi , i = 1, 2, is the 3-master of v. So γ(vi → v) = 12 for i = 1, 2. Thus
w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + 2 × 12 = 0. If k = 4, then w∗ (v) = w(v) = 0. If 5 ≤ k ≤ 8, then
w∗ (v) = w(v) − k × k−4
k = 0. If k ≥ 9, then v can be the 3-master of at most
∗
one 3-vertex. So w (v) ≥ w(v) − 12 − k2 = k−9
2 ≥ 0.

Planar Graphs Without Cycles of Speciﬁc Lengths

In this section, we consider planar graphs without certain cycles. Note notations
and deﬁnitions are the same as those in Section 2. Following result is our main
theorem in this section.
Theorem 3.1. Let G be a planar graph with maximum degree Δ such that G is
free of k-cycles, where k ≥ 3. Then G is total-(Δ + 2)-choosable, if
(1) Δ ≥ 5 and k = 3, or
(2) Δ ≥ 5 and k = 4, or
(3) Δ ≥ 6 and k = 5, or
(4) Δ ≥ 6 and k = 6.
Proof. Let G = (V, E, F ) be a minimal counterexample to the theorem. Then
G has the following proprieties.

(a) G is connected.
(b) G contains no edge uv with min{d(u), d(v)} ≤ Δ+1
and d(u) + d(v) ≤

Δ + 2.
(c) δ(G) ≥ 3 and for any 3-vertex v ∈ V , v has exactly two 3-masters. For
each vertex v of degree Δ, v can be the 3-master of at most one 3-vertex.
(a) is obvious. The proofs of (b) and (c) are the same as the above in Theorem
2.1, so we omit.
Since G is a planar graph, by Euler’s formula, we have
(d(v) − 4) +

(d(f ) − 4) = −4(|V | − |E| + |F |) = −8 < 0.
f ∈F

v∈V

Now we deﬁne the initial charge function w(x) = d(x) − 4 for each x ∈ V ∪ F .
w(x) < 0.
It follows that
x∈V ∪F

In order to prove (1), we are ready to construct a new charge w∗ (x) on G as
follows.
R1 : Each 3-vertex receives 12 from each of its 3-master.
Clearly, w∗ (f ) = w(f ) ≥ 0 for any face f ∈ F . If v is a 3-vertex by (c), then
v has exactly two 3-masters . So w∗ (v) = w(v) + 2 × 12 = 0. If v is a 4-vertex,
then w∗ (v) = w(v) = 0. If v is a 5+ -vertex, then v can be the 3-master of at
most one 3-vertex. So w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) − 12 > 0.
We will prove the following claim before we proof (2).
Claim 3.2. If Δ ≥ 5, then G contains no 3-face f = uvw such that d(u) =
d(v) = d(w) = 4.
Proof. Suppose on the contrary, such 3-face does exist. Thus G − {uv, uw, vw}
has a list total coloring φ by the minimality of G, then erase the colors on u, v and
w. For each element x incident with f , we deﬁne a reduced total list L (x) such
that L (x) = L(x) \ {φ(x )|x is incident or adjacent to x and x is not incident
with f }. Then |L (u)| ≥ 3, |L (v)| ≥ 3, |L (w)| ≥ 3, |L (uv)| ≥ 3, |L (uw)| ≥ 3
and |L (vw)| ≥ 3. It follows from χl (C3 ) = χ (C3 ) = 3 that uncolor elements
incident with f in G can be colored from its total lists L . This contradicts the
choice of G as a counterexample.
To prove (2), we are ready to construct a new charge w∗ (x) on G as follows:
3
from each of its 3-master.
R2.1 : Each 3-vertex receives 10
R2.2 : For a k-face f , where k ≥ 5, and each occurrence of a vertex v ∈ b(f ),
transfer the amount k−4
k from f to v.
R2.3 : From each 4-vertex to each of its incident 3-face, transfer 15 .
R2.4 : From each 5+ -vertex v to each of its incident 3-face, transfer 35 .

Clearly, w∗ (f ) = w(f ) − k × k−4
= 0 if k ≥ 5. Let f be a 3-face. If f is
k
incident with a 3-vertex, then the other vertices f incident with are 5+ -vertices.
So w∗ (f ) = w(f ) + 2 × 35 = 15 > 0. Otherwise, f is incident with at least one
5+ -vertex by Claim 3.2. So w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 2 × 15 + 35 = 0.

Let v be a k-vertex. If k = 3, then v has exactly two 3-master by (c)
and v is incident with at least two 5+ -faces since G is C4 -free. So w∗ (f ) ≥

w(f ) + 2 × 10
+ 2 × 15 = 0. If k = 4, then v is incident with at most two 3∗
faces. So w (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 2 × 15 − 2 × 15 = 0. If k = 5, then v can be the 3master of at most one 3-vertex and v is incident with at most two 3-faces. So

w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 3 × 15 − 2 × 35 − 10

k

most 2 3-faces, since G is C4 -free. So w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 15 × k2 − k2 × 35 − 10
> 0.
∗
To prove (3), we are ready to construct a new charge w (x) on G as follows.
R3.1 : Each 3-vertex receives 12 from each of its 3-master.
R3.2 : For a k-face f , where k ≥ 6, and each occurrence of a vertex v ∈ b(f ),
transfer the amount 13 from f to v.
R3.3 : From each 4-vertex to each of its incident 3-face, transfer 13 .
R3.4 : From each 5+ -vertex to each of its incident 3-face, transfer 12 .
Clearly, w∗ (f ) = w(f ) = 0 if d(f ) = 4. Assume that d(f ) = 3. If δ(f ) = 3,
then f is incident with two 6+ -vertices by (b). So w∗ (f ) = w(f ) + 2 × 12 =
0. Otherwise, w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 3 × 13 = 0. If f is a 6+ -face, then w∗ (f ) =

w(f ) − d(f ) × 13 = 2d(f

Let v be a k-vertex. If k = 3, then w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + 2 × 12 = 0. Assume that k =
4. If v is incident with no 3-faces, then w∗ (v) = w(v) = 0. Otherwise, v is incident
with at least two 6+ -faces, since G is C5 -free, so w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + 2 × 13 − 2 × 13 =
0. Assume that k = 5. If v is incident with no 3-faces, then w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) =
1 > 0. Otherwise, v is incident with at most three 3-faces and if v is incident
with exactly three 3-faces, then the other faces f incident with are 6+ -faces. So
w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + min{−2 × 12 , −3 × 12 + 2 × 13 } = 0. Let k = 6. Then v can be
the 3-master of at most one 3-vertex. If v is incident with at most three 3-faces,
then w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) − 12 − 3 × 12 = 0. Otherwise, v is incident with exactly four
3-faces since G is C5 -free, and the other faces f incident with are 6+ -faces. So
w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) − 12 − 4 × 12 + 2 × 13 = 16 > 0. If k ≥ 7, then v is incident with at
most (k − 2) 3-faces since G is C5 -free. So w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) − 12 − (k − 2) × 12 =
k−7
2 ≥ 0.
In order to proof (4) in the theorem, we need the following claim.
Claim 3.3. If Δ ≥ 6 and G contains a 3-face f = uvw such that d(u) = d(v) =
4, then d(w) ≥ 6.
Proof. Otherwise, d(w) ≤ 5. We can list total color G − {uv, uw, vw} by the
minimality of G, then erase the colors on u, v and w. For each element x incident
with f , we deﬁne a reduced total list L (x) similar to Claim 3.2. Then |L (w)| ≥ 2,
|L (u)| ≥ 4,|L (v)| ≥ 4, |L (uw)| ≥ 3, |L (vw)| ≥ 3 and |L (uv)| ≥ 4. If there
is a color α ∈ L (wu) \ L (u), then color wu with color α and color w, wv, v, uv
and u successively. So L (wu) ⊆ L (u). If there is a color β ∈ L (u) \ L (v), then
color u with β and color w, uw, wv, uv and v successively. So L (u) ⊆ L (v).
This implies that L (wu) ⊆ L (v). Choose a color γ ∈ L (wu) and color wu

required contradiction.
We are ready to construct a new charge w∗ (x) on G as follows.

R4.2 : For a k-face f , where k ≥ 5, and each occurrence of a vertex v ∈ b(f ),

Clearly, w∗ (f ) = w(f ) = 0 if d(f ) = 4 and w∗ (f ) = w(f ) − k × k−4
k = 0 if
k ≥ 5. Let f = [u1 u2 u3 ] be a 3-face with d(u1 ) ≤ d(u2 ) ≤ d(u3 ). If d(u1 ) = 3,
then d(u2 ) = d(u3 ) = Δ. So w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 2 × 12 = 0. If d(u1 ) ≥ 5, then
w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 3 × 13 = 0. Assume that d(u1 ) = 4. If d(u2 ) = 4, then d(u3 ) ≥ 6
by Claim 3.3. So γ(u3 → f ) = 35 . In this case, without loss of generality, we
suppose that γ(u1 → f ) ≤ γ(u2 → f ). If γ(u1 → f ) = 0, then u1 is incident
with at least three 3-faces. This implies that u2 is incident with at least two 7+ faces. So γ(u2 → f ) = 37 . Thus w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 37 + 35 > 0. If γ(u1 → f ) = 15 ,
then γ(u2 → f ) ≥ 15 . So w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 2 × 15 + 35 = 0. If γ(u1 → f ) = 37 ,
then w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 37 + 35 > 0. If d(u2 ) ≥ 5, then γ(u2 → f ) ≥ 12 and
γ(u3 → f ) ≥ 12 . So w∗ (f ) ≥ w(f ) + 2 × 12 = 0.
Let v be a k-vertex. If k = 3, then w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + 2 × 12 = 0. Let k = 4.
If n3 (v) = 0, then w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) = 0. If n3 (v) ≥ 3, then w∗ (v) = w(v) =
0. If n7+ (v) ≥ 2, then v is incident with at most two 3-faces. So w∗ (v) ≥
w(v) + 2 × 37 − 2 × 37 = 0. Otherwise, let f be a 3-face incident with v. Then
γ(v → f ) = 15 . In this case, if n3 (v) = 1, then v is incident with at least 5+ faces since G is C6 -free. So w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + 15 − 15 = 0. If n3 (v) = 2, then v
is incident with at least one 7+ -faces. So w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) + 37 − 2 × 15 > 0. Let
k = 5. Then v is incident with at most three 3-faces. If n3 (v) ≤ 2, then w∗ (v) ≥

not adjacent to a 3-vertex, then w∗ (v) ≥ w(v) − 4 × 35 + 2 × 37 > 0. Otherwise,
v is adjacent to a 3-vertex. This implies that v is incident with at least one
