Abstract. A modified model for testing market efficiency is presented, with
introducing convenience yield and using lagged spot prices to adjust risk
premium. Subsequently, an examination about market efficiency in international
petroleum markets is given using the modified model for three widely traded oil
commodities: WTI crude oil, unleaded gasoline, and heating oil. The main
findings are that there have significant differences about market efficiency in
different oil futures markets, and a nonlinear relationship among spot price,
futures price, risk premium, and convenience yield is found in the crude oil
market but not in refined oil markets. The nonlinear relationship can be
eliminated through dividing the observed period into several stages. Meanwhile,
the crude oil futures market is more and more efficient.
Keywords: International petroleum markets, Market efficiency, Futures price
spot price, Risk premium, Convenience yield, Cointegration analysis.

1 Introduction
Today, oil is the world’s most heavily exchanged commodity, with frequently
fluctuation of its prices. Correspondingly, the oil futures markets play a more and more
important role in the international oil markets. So the behavior about market efficiency
in oil futures markets is arresting.
Several studies have examined this market efficiency in oil markets with mixed
results. Bopp and Sitzer [1] argue that futures prices are good predictors of spot prices
in the heating oil market. Ma [2] examines the existence of a risk premium for crude oil,
heating oil, and leaded gasoline futures with maturities of 1, 2, 3, and 6-months. The
results provide little evidence for a risk premium and there does not appear to be a
systematic bias in the observed futures prices, supporting the simple efficiency
hypothesis. Serletis and Banack [3] provide evidence that spot prices for crude oil,
heating oil, and unleaded gasoline are cointegrated with their respective futures prices,
but they do not explicitly test the joint restrictions implied by the unbiased hypothesis.

An Analysis About Market Efficiency in International Petroleum Markets

993

Using monthly observations of 30-day crude oil futures, Crowder and Hamed [4] test
the simple efficiency hypothesis and the arbitrage condition, and obtain the conclusion
supporting the former one. Roger and Mougoue [5] present some empirical results that the
market efficiency hypothesis is supported by the data after the presence of nonlinear dependence
using BDS test statistic and GARCH model. Recently, Joseph, Higgins and Miller [6] point

out that oil futures prices do not predict well, and not also provide any easy way to
predict the price of oil is headed. They attribute this result to convenience yield of oil
storage.
So far, we can derive an elementary impression from above discussion that the
market efficiency of oil futures markets is increasingly suspect due to frequent
fluctuation of oil along with market speculation. Hence, further empirical testing is
required to resolve, or at least to shed some light on, this issue as applied to the oil
market.
The objective of this paper is to provide an empirical analysis about market
efficiency in oil futures markets based on a modified testing model.

2 Models and Data
The efficiency of the futures markets in commodities or currency exchange has been
extensively tested using the model

S t = α 0 + α 1 Ft −1 + ε t

(1)

S t is the natural logarithm of the spot price in period t and Ft −1 is the
analogously defined futures price in period t -1 with the maturity period t , ε t is
stochastic error. In eq. (1), if α 0 = 0 , α 1 = 1 and ε t is white noise, then the futures
where

market is weak form efficiency (see [7]). Weak form efficiency is also called as simple
efficiency.
Subsequently, Brenner and Kroner [8] derive the conditions for market efficiency
under the no arbitrage rule. Their model is

S t = α 0 + α 1 Ft −1 + α 2 Rt + ε t
where S t ,

(2)

Ft −1 and ε t are defined as in eq. (1), Rt is the continuously compounded

rate of return on the risk-free bond. A necessary condition for futures market efficiency
is that there is a cointegration relationship among variables S t , Ft −1 , Rt , and the
error term is serially uncorrelated as well as α 1 = α 2 = 1 .
However, eq. (2) ignores two points. One point is the convenience yield of
commodities storage. The other is how to calculate the risk premium. For oil
commodities, first, it has a use option: if your refinery really needs input today, you can
send your own oil to it. On the other hand, oil is easy to store in the ground, thus, you
have some opportunities to obtain higher benefit when oil price rises. In addition,
convenience yield comes often from oil shortage in a short future time.

994

S. Wang, J. Li, and S. Zhang

In general, convenience yield is unobserved and uncertain. Gibson and Schwartz [9]
estimate the convenience yield in the oil commodity market, and demonstrate that the
convenience yield has significant mean reversion tendencies and conclude that it is a
stationary process. We utilize this result to modify eq. (2).
Let y t be convenience yield of oil commodity in period t , then y t may be
denoted as

y t = μ + u t , ht = h0 + ∑i =1 β i u t2−i + ∑ j =1θ j ht − j
q

where

μ

the error

is the mean value of convenience yield and

p

(3)

ht is the conditional variance of

u t . Here, ht is expressed as a generalized autoregressive conditional

heteroscedasticity process, i.e. GARCH model. The investors perhaps hope to gain
convenience yield from oil storage. Therefore, eq. (2) should comprise

y t , i.e.

S t = α 0 + μ + α 1 Ft −1 + α 2 Rt + u t + ε t .
Let

α 0 + μ = μ0

and

(4)

u t + ε t = wt , then we obtain

S t = μ 0 + α 1 Ft −1 + α 2 Rt + wt , ht = h0 + ∑i =1 β i wt2−i + ∑ j =1θ j ht − j . (5)
q

where

p

ht is the conditional variance of the error wt .

The second problem involves the calculation of the risk premium. We know that the
investors only need to provide a small part of margin (about 5-10% of contract value)
for buying or selling futures contracts. Therefore, the risk premium mainly concerns
spot commodities but not futures contracts. According to this point, we adjust Rt in
eq. (2) as follows

Rt = S t −1 rt .
where

(6)

S t −1 is the spot price in period t − 1 and rt is continuous compounding rate.

Combines eq. (5) with eq. (6), we can obtain

S t = μ 0 + α 1 Ft −1 + α 2 S t −1rt + wt , ht = h0 + ∑i =1 β i wt2−i + ∑ j =1θ j ht − j . (7)
q

p

where all symbols in eq. (7) have the same definitions with eq. (5) and (6).
So far we argue the futures market is efficient if eq. (7) satisfies the conditions: (a)
there is a cointegration relationship among variables S t , Ft −1 and S t −1 rt ; (b) α 1 = 1
and

α 2 = 1 ; (c) wt

is serially uncorrelated and its mean value is zero.

The data used to test the efficiency of the oil futures markets are monthly
observations from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), including three oil
commodities: WTI crude oil, unleaded gasoline, and heating oil. The oil futures and
spot prices series are available at http://www.eia.doe.gov. The observed period for WTI

An Analysis About Market Efficiency in International Petroleum Markets

995

is from Jan. 1986 to Dec. 2004, but for the latter two commodities is from Jun. 1986 to
Dec. 2004. The futures price is defined as the closing price of a futures contract 30 days
prior to the last day of trading on that contract. The future spot price is the cash price on
the last trading day of the corresponding futures contract. The risk-free rate series is
defined as the interest rate on the 3-month contract U.S. Treasury Bill that matures
nearest to the last trading day of the relevant futures contract, and the data are available
at http://www.economagic.com/. All variables are transformed into natural logarithm
for eliminating in certain extent the heteroscedasticity of the error in eq. (7). The
software we used is SAS 8.2.

3 Empirical Results
3.1 Stationarity Tests
The ADF unit root tests for the spot price, futures price and risk-free return of each oil
product show that all these series are nonstationary. At the same time, all first
differences are stationary, i.e., all these series are I (1) ( integration of order one).
3.2 Cointegration Analysis
3.2.1 A Linear Analysis
It is important to point out that the risk-free return

Rt = S t −1 rt is quite little (less than
1 in general) in the real oil markets, so the natural logarithm of Rt is negative. Thus, it
−

is needed to test the null hypothesis of market inefficiency (i.e. α 2 =-1) for risk
premium in Table 1.
Table 1 gives the estimate results of long-run relationship among Spot price ( S t ),
lagged futures price ( Ft −1 ), risk premium ( Rt ) and convenience yield ( μ 0 ) for the
three oil products. It should note that we do not adjust the error term using GARCH
model. Table 2 reports the results of cointegration tests, and it indicates that there is a
cointegration relationship among these variables for all three oil products.
Some results can be obtained from Table 1, as follows:
(a) For WTI crude oil and unleaded gasoline futures markets, it is significant at 0.05
−

level to reject the joint hypothesis:

−

α1 =1 and α 2

=-1 as well as the sole hypothesis:

−

α1

=1. This indicates that neither simple efficiency nor arbitrage equilibrium
efficiency exist in the two markets. However, the futures prices have large forecasting
function for the spot prices, and GDW tests imply the errors in eq. (7) are serially
uncorrelated. In addition, there is convenience yield but not risk premium in the
gasoline market, while the risk premium but not convenience yield exists in WTI crude
oil market.

significance of 0.2, respectively. This suggests the heating oil futures market is simple
efficiency but not arbitrage equilibrium efficiency.
What could possibly explain above results? Why the three oil futures markets exhibit
differences on market efficiency?
One possible explanation is that the crude oil prices fluctuate frequently from Jan
1986 to Dec 2004. In Table 1 Q and LM tests indicate that the errors have conditional
heteroscedasticity for WTI crude oil in the observed period, so the structural
relationship among spot price, lagged futures price, risk premium and convenience
yield perhaps has changed. The changed structural relationship influences the accuracy
of testing market efficiency. For gasoline and heating oil futures, they can utilize more
information than crude oil market, for example, use crude oil futures price. Therefore, it
does not have conditional heteroscedasticity of the errors in eq. (7) for the two oil
products. Secondly, the speculative activities are more prevailing in the crude oil
futures markets than refined oil markets. Hence, the risk premium is significant in WTI
crude oil market but not in gasoline and heating oil markets. Finally, gasoline
consumption is the largest in all of refined oil products in the world, so it comes easily
forth shortage due to hoarding. Thus, gasoline storage possibly carries more
convenience yield than the other two oil commodities for the holders.
Although the three oil futures markets present differences in the aspect of market
efficiency, there is an identical point that the futures prices have large forecasting
function for the spot prices.
3.2.2 A Nonlinear Analysis with GARCH Estimates
As the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity in WTI crude oil futures, we use eq.
(7) to analyze the nonlinear relationship among these variables.
−

Table 3 gives the parameters estimates and relevant tests. Since the coefficient β1 is
statistically significant at 0.05 level, the variance equation in eq. (7) is an ARCH(1)
model. This implies the lagged errors impose a short-term influence to the conditional
variance. The testing results in Table 3 do not support simple efficiency hypothesis or
arbitrage equilibrium efficiency hypothesis.

3.3 Analysis by Stages
Since the errors of eq. (7) have conditional heteroscedasticity for WTI crude oil in the
observed period, in order to discuss effectively the market efficiency in the futures
market, it is a good way to divide the observed period into several appropriate stages.
According to the movement characteristic of the residuals in Table 2, we try to
divide the observed period into three stages: the first stage from Jan 1986 to Sep 1990,
the second stage from Oct 1990 to Nov 2000, and the third stage from Dec 2000 to Dec
2004.
Table 4 reports the parameters estimates and relevant testing statistics for each of the
three stages. Q and LM statistics tests indicate that there is no conditional
heteroscedasticity longer in the error series for each stage. This further suggests the
division of three stages is reasonable. Table 5 shows the results of AEG tests, and it
indicates that there is a cointegration relationship among these variables (spot price,
lagged futures price, risk premium and convenience yield) for all the three stages.

An Analysis About Market Efficiency in International Petroleum Markets

Similarly, we can obtain some results about market efficiency in each stage from
Table 4. The market efficiency is rather low in the WTI futures market in the first
period, and the second stage supports simple efficiency hypothesis but not arbitrage
equilibrium efficiency. However, the WTI futures market is semi-strong form
efficiency (see [7]) in the third stage. These results imply that the market is more and
more efficient and the speculators increasingly attach importance to risk premium.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we present a modification for arbitrage equilibrium efficiency model,
with introducing convenience yield and using lagged spot price to adjust risk premium.
Empirical analysis indicates that there are significant differences about market
efficiency in different oil futures markets: WTI and gasoline futures markets are neither
simple efficiency nor arbitrage equilibrium efficiency, while heating oil futures market
supports simple efficiency hypothesis. The analysis by stages for WTI futures market
implies that the market is more and more efficient. Moreover, it is semi-strong form
efficiency from Dec 2000 to Dec 2004.
