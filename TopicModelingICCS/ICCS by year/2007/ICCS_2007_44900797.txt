Abstract. In this paper, we proposed an IP Local Link-Protection
(IPLLP) scheme based on the characteristic of shortest-path routing
in IP networks. Our scheme working in an intra-area routing domain
provides a simple and eﬃcient solution to improve IP network survivability without extra control protocols and enhanced routing protocols.
Because the backup next hops are predetermined in advance, the service
interrupted time can be limited to a few milliseconds. In the simulation
results, we observe that IP Local Link-Protection scheme can eﬃciently
improve network survivability in a small-scale and high-degree network.
Keyword: IP network survivability, link protection, fast reroute.

Introduction

Network availability becomes a more and more important QoS (Quality of Service) parameter in IP networks. Certain services should not be interrupted regardless of the scale, duration and type of failures. IP network has the ability
of routing restoration since the ARPANET was built, i.e. IP restoration. In
addition, many protection schemes have been implemented at lower layers in
IP networks, e.g. SONET APS (Automatic Protection Switching), MPLS FastReroute, etc. Since their backup paths are decided and set up for network failures
in advance, the service interrupted time can be limited to a few milliseconds.
Recently, the IP protection issue has been discussed since 2002. The precomputation scheme of second shortest paths is introduced in [1]. However, in the
practice, how to decide feasible backup routes eﬃciently, provide an eﬃcient
fast reroute service and avoid routing loops was not discussed. The drafts of IP
Fast-Reroute (IPFRR) framework [2] and LFAP (Loop Free Alternate Paths)
scheme[3] were proposed by IETF Routing Area Working Group. Equal Cost
Multipath (ECMP) and LFAP oﬀer the simplest repair paths, and it is anticipated that around 80% of failures can be repaired using these alone. However,
the ECMP scheme needs extra control protocols to negotiate which equal cost

path is failed after a node or a link fails. Additionally, multi-hop repair paths
are considerably more complex, and extra control protocols or enhanced routing
protocols should be needed. It is anticipated that around 98% of failures can be
repaired.
In this paper, we proposed an IP Local Lode-Protection (IPLLP) scheme for
IP networks in an intra-area routing domain. Our scheme provides a simple and
eﬃcient solution for IP network protection without extra control protocols and
enhanced routing protocols. According to characteristic of destination tree with
shortest-path routing, our scheme can prevent service disruption and packet
loss caused by the loops which normally occur during the re-convergence of the
network following a failure. The packets through the failure link can be locally
rerouted to the backup next hop as soon as the upstream adjacent nodes of the
failure node detect the failure. Because the backup next hop is predetermined,
the service interrupted time can be limited to within a few milliseconds.

Local Link Protection Scheme

A network topology G(N, L), where N and L denote the router set and the link
set respectively, is given. Note that G(N, L) can be deduced from the database of
link-state routing protocols. After calculating the primary next hop, every router
assumes that the connected link with their primary next hop to the destination
node d is failed. First, they calculate the destination tree Td to node d according
to G(N, L). Second, they remove the connected link with their primary next hop
from the destination tree Td , divide the tree into two subtrees and then try to
repair the incomplete destination subtree to node d with the leaved tree as a
partial shortest-path destination tree Tˇd . Because only the connected nodes of
the failed link can sense this failure in the ﬁrst time, the traﬃc ﬂows are delivered
along the partial shortest-path destination tree Tˇd before IGP converges. Therefore, if the adjacent nodes can cooperatively construct the partial shortest-path
destination tree based on the divided subtrees, their loop-free backup next hops
to the destination node d will be decided.
An example of IPLLP scheme is shown in Fig. 1. If a bidirectional link
{N3 , N2 } fails, N3 is responsible to predecide a feasible backup next hop for
this link failure to the destination node N0 . The {N3 , N2 } is removed from the
topology, and TN0 is divided into TN0 and TN3 . If N3 can select a shortest-path
and feasible next hop on TN0 to construct a partial shortest-path destination
tree TˇN0 , its backup next hop is existent; otherwise, the link failure cannot be
protected. N4 is selected for link {N3 , N2 } failure to N0 by N3 in our example,
packet loss caused by the loops doesn’t arise during the IGP routing recovery.

Simulation and Numerical Result

The goal of our simulations is to justify our IPLLP scheme. We observe the performance in protectability. Protectability is deﬁned as the ratio of the protectable
O-D pairs to the recoverable O-D pairs. For example, after IGP converges, the 6

failure paths can be repaired. However, by a protection scheme, if only 3 paths
can be protected, the protectability is equal to 0.5.
In our simulations, topologies are given. The shortest path algorithm (i.e.,
Dijkstra’s algorithm), our IPLLP and the LFAP are implemented in our program. First, the routing tables of each node that contain primary next hops and
backup next hops are built. Second, all scenarios of each link failure are simulated, and all O-D pairs are tested according to the present routing tables. Third,
the shortest path algorithm is performed to repair all scenarios of each link failure. Finally, the numbers of the protected paths and the recoverable paths are
collected, and the average protectability can be computed statistically.
Random ﬂat topologies in our simulation are generated by BRITE topology
generator[4]. A new node connects to a candidate neighbor node using Waxman’s
probability function (α = 0.19 and β = 0.2), and the total node number |N |
and the average connectivity degree d are given. The connectivity degree means
the number of connected links in a node, and then a topology G(N, L) can be
generated. Additionally, all link costs in our topologies are constant and equal,
i.e., the same link bandwidth.
Fig. 2 shows the relationships between average network protectability and
network scalability while a link failure occurs in the random ﬂat topologies
whose average connectivity degrees are equal to 4 and 6. We observe the performances of our IPLLP scheme are better than the LFAP scheme, especially
in high connectivity-degree networks. Some ECMP next hops may be feasible
loop-free backup next hops, but they don’t satisfy the criteria of LFAP scheme.
Additionally, with the increase of network scalability, the protectabilities of both
schemes are decreased. Although many available paths can be found in a large
IP network, the IP network still limits the traﬃc to go through the few shortest
paths because of the destination-based routing. Thus, the performance of them
cannot achieve to that of other protection schemes in connection-oriented networks, e.g., MPLS network, SONET and optical network; however, the IPLLP
scheme can provide a simple and eﬀective protection solution.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose an IP Local Link-Protection (IPLLP) scheme in an
intra-area routing domain, which provides a simple and eﬃcient solution for IP
network protection. Extra control protocols and enhanced routing protocols are
not needed if a conventional link-state routing protocol is used. In our simulation, all of IPLLP scheme and LFAP scheme work well, and they are suitable for
a small-scale and high-degree intra-area network. In a small network, the computational complexity would not be the major factor to impact the performance of
IPLLP scheme. Thus, the alternative of computational complexity and network
scale may be considered between IPLLP scheme and LFAP scheme. Additionally, based on the Destination SPT concept, our work may extend to protect
multiple failures by grouping failures and deﬁning failure events. Its aﬀected
area and feasible next hop can be decided in advance. Finally, we believe that
IPLLP scheme can give a good solution to IP network protection technology.
