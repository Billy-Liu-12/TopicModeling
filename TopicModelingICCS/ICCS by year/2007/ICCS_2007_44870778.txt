Abstract. Delays are an important feature in temporal models of genetic regulation due to slow biochemical processes such as transcription
and translation. In this paper we show how to model intrinsic noise effects in a delayed setting. As a particular application we apply these
ideas to modelling somite segmentation in zebraﬁsh across a number of
cells in which two linked oscillatory genes her1 and her7 are synchronized
via Notch signalling between the cells.
Keywords: delay stochastic simulation algorithm, coupled regulatory
systems, multicellular environment, multiscale modelling.

Introduction

Temporal models of genetic regulatory networks have to take account of time
delays that are associated with transcription, translation and nuclear and cytoplasmic translocations in order to allow for more reliable predictions [1]. An
important aspect of modelling biochemical reaction systems is intrinsic noise that
is due to the uncertainty of knowing when a reaction occurs and which reaction it
is. When modelling intrinsic noise we can identify three modelling regimes. The
ﬁrst regime corresponds to the case where there are small numbers of molecules
in the system so that intrinsic noise eﬀects dominate. In this regime the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) [2] is the method of choice and it describes
the evolution of a discrete nonlinear Markov process representing the number of
molecules in the system. The intermediate regime is called the Langevin regime
and here the framework for modelling chemical kinetics is that of a system of
Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equations. In this regime the numbers of molecules are
such that we can talk about concentrations rather than individual numbers of
molecules but the intrinsic noise eﬀects are still signiﬁcant. The ﬁnal regime is
the deterministic regime where there are large numbers of molecules for each
species. This regime is given by the standard chemical kinetic rate equations
that are described by ordinary diﬀerential equations. In some sense this third
regime represents the mean behaviour of the kinetics in the other two regimes.
It is vital to model the chemical kinetics of a system in the most appropriate
regime otherwise the dynamics may be poorly represented.

In order to take proper account of both intrinsic randomness and time delays,
we have developed the delay stochastic simulation algorithm (DSSA) [3]. This
algorithm very naturally generalises the SSA in a delayed setting.
Transcriptional and translational time delays are known to drive genetic oscillators. There are many types of molecular clocks that regulate biological
processes but apart from circadian clocks [4] these clocks are still relatively
poorly characterised. Oscillatory dynamics are also observed for Notch signalling
molecules such as Hes1 and Her1/Her7. The hes1 gene and the two linked genes
her1 and her7 are known to play key roles as molecular clocks during somite
segmentation in mouse and zebraﬁsh, respectively.
In zebraﬁsh the genes her1 and her7 are autorepressed by their own gene
products and positively regulated by Notch signalling that leads to oscillatory
gene expression with a period of about 30 min, generating regular patterns of
somites (future segments of the vertebrate) [5]. In both cases the transcriptional
and translational delays are responsible for the oscillatory behaviour.
In a recent set of experiments Hirata et al. [6] measured the production of
hes1 mRNA and Hes1 protein in mouse. They measured a regular two hour cycle
with a phase lag of approximately 15 minutes between the oscillatory proﬁles
of mRNA and protein. The oscillations are not dependent on the stimulus but
can be induced by exposure to cells expressing delta. This work led to a number
of modelling approaches using the framework of Delay Diﬀerential Equations
(DDEs) [1,7]. However, in a more recent work Barrio et al. used a discrete delay
simulation algorithm that took into account intrinsic noise and transcriptional
and translational delays to show that the Hes1 system was robust to intrinsic
noise but that the oscillatory dynamics crucially depended on the size of the
transcriptional and translational delays.
In a similar setting Lewis [5] and Giudicelli and Lewis [8] have studied the
nature of somite segmentation in zebraﬁsh. In zebraﬁsh it is well known that two
linked oscillating genes her1/her7 code for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins
that are implicated in the pattern of somites at the tail end of the zebraﬁsh embryo. The genes her1 and her7 code for autoinhibitory transcription factors Her1
and Her7 (see Fig. 1). The direct autoinhibition causes oscillations in mRNA
and protein concentrations with a period determined by the transcriptional and
translational delays.
Horikawa et al. [9] have performed a series of experiments in which they investigate the system-level properties of the segmentation clock in zebraﬁsh. Their
main conclusion is that the segmentation clock behaves as a coupled oscillator.
The key element is the Notch-dependent intercellular communication which itself
is regulated by the internal hairy oscillator and whose coupling of neighbouring
cells synchronises the oscillations. In one particular experiment they replaced
some coupled cells by cells that were out of phase with the remaining cells but
showed that at a later stage they still became fully synchronised. Clearly the
intercellular coupling plays a crucial role in minimising the eﬀects of noise to
maintain coherent oscillations.

Both Lewis and Horikawa have used a stochastic model to understand the
above eﬀects. But this model is very diﬀerent from our approach. The Lewis
model for a single cell and two coupled cells is generalised by Horikawa et al.
to a one-dimensional array of cells. In both approaches they essentially couple a
delay diﬀerential equation with noise associated with the uncertainty of proteins
binding to the operator sites on the DNA. In our case we are rigorously applying
the eﬀects of intrinsic noise, in a delayed setting, at all stages of the chemical
kinetics. We also note that this is the ﬁrst stage in developing a truly multi-scaled
approach to understanding the eﬀects of delays in a multi-celled environment.
Such a multi-scaled model will require us to couple together delay models in the
discrete, stochastic and deterministic regimes - see, for example, attempts to do
this in Burrage et al. [10].
Section 2 gives a brief description of our DSSA implementation along with
a mathematical description of the coupled Her1/Her7 Delta-Notch system for
a linear chain of cells. Section 3 presents the numerical results and the paper
concludes with discussion on the signiﬁcance of our approach.

Methods

The SSA describes the evolution of a discrete stochastic chemical kinetic process
in a well stirred mixture. Thus assume that there are m reactions between N
chemical species, and let X(t) = (X1 (t), · · · , XN (t)) be the vector of chemical
species where Xi (t) is the number of species i at time t. The chemical kinetics
is uniquely characterised by the m stoichiometric vectors ν1 , · · · , νm and the
propensity functions a1 (X), · · · , am (X) that represent the unscaled probabilities
of the reactions to occur. The underlying idea behind the SSA is that at each time
step t a step size θ is determined from an exponential waiting time distribution
such that at most one reaction can occur in the time interval (t, t+θ). If the most
likely reaction, as determined from the relative sizes of the propensity functions,
is reaction j say, then the state vector is updated as X(t + θ) = X(t) + νj .

end

In a delayed setting, the SSA loses its Markov property and concurrent events
become an issue as non-delayed instantaneous reactions occur while delayed reactions wait to be updated. In our implementation [3] (see Algorithm 1), the
DSSA proceeds as the SSA as long as there are no delayed reactions scheduled
in the next time step. Otherwise, it ignores the waiting time and the reaction
that should be updated beyond the current update point and moves to the scheduled delayed reaction. Furthermore, in order to avoid the possibility of obtaining
negative molecular numbers, reactants and products of delayed consuming reactions must be updated separately, namely when the delayed reaction is selected
and when it is completed, respectively.
Our model is based on the chemical reaction models of Lewis and Horikawa
et al. but our implementation is entirely diﬀerent as intrinsic noise is represented

For the 5-cell model we get 30 diﬀerent species and a set of 60 reactions. The
corresponding rate constants are listed in Table 1. Denote by Mh1 , Mh7 , Md ,

propensities aR1 = ch1 Mh1 , aR2 = ch7 Mh7 , aR3 = cd Md , aR4 = bh1 Ph1 , aR5 =

with reaction rate constants ah1 , ah7 and ad and propensities aR7 = ah1 Mh1 ,

the balance of internal and external contribution of oscillating molecules. With
rh + rhd = 1 the coupling strength rhd /rh can be deﬁned. In our experiments we
set rhd = 1, that is, the coupling is 100% combinatorial. In accordance with the

The single cell, single-gene model consists only of 2 species (her1 mRNA and
Her1 protein) and 4 reactions. The two degradation and the single translation
reactions correspond to those in the 5-cell model. For the inhibitory regulation
of transcription we assume a Hill function with Hill coeﬃcient 2 (Ph1 acts as a
dimer). The Hill function takes the form f (Ph1 ) = 1/(1 + (Ph1 /P0 )2 ).

Results and Discussion

In this section we present individual simulations of a system of 5 coupled cells,
so that the dimension of the system is 30, in both the DSSA and DDE cases.
Figure 2 (a,b) shows the dynamics for a single cell. In the DDE case after
an initial overshoot, the amplitudes are completely regular and the oscillatory
period is approximately 40 minutes. In the intrinsic noise case there are still
sustained oscillations but there is some irregularity in the proﬁles and the oscillatory period is closer to 50 minutes. The time lag (5-7 min) between protein
and mRNA is about the same in both cases. In Fig. 2 (c,d) we present DSSA
simulations of the 5 coupled cells and give the proﬁles for mRNA and protein at
deltaC and her1 for cell 3. Now the period of oscillation is closer to 45 minutes
and the lag between protein and mRNA is about 25 minutes for deltaC and
about 7 minutes for her1. Thus we see that the coupling has some eﬀect on the
period of oscillation. In Fig. 3 we mimic an experiment by Horikawa et al. In
both the DDE and the DSSA setting we disturb cell 3 after a certain time period
(500 minutes in the DSSA case and 260 minutes in the DDE case). This is done
by resetting all the values for cell 3 to zero at this point. This is meant to represent the experiment of Horikawa et al. in which some of the cells are replaced
by oscillating cells that are out of phase. They then observed that nearly all the
cells become resynchronized after three oscillations (90 min.). Interestingly, in
the DDE setting it only takes about 60 minutes for the onset of resynchronization while in the DSSA setting it takes about 180 minutes. The diﬀerence can
be partly due to the larger number of cells that are experimentally transplanted.

Conclusions

In this paper we have simulated Delta-Notch coupled her1/her7 oscillators for 5
cells in both the deterministic (DDE) and delayed, intrinsic noise setting (DSSA).
We have shown that there are some similarities between the dynamics of both
but the intrinsic noise simulations do make some predictions that are diﬀerent to
the deterministic model (see Fig. 3) that can be veriﬁed experimentally. Thus it
is important that both intrinsic noise delayed models and continuous deterministic delay models are simulated whenever insights into genetic regulation are
being gleaned. However, since the time steps in the DSSA setting can be very
small, there are considerable computational overheads in modelling even a chain
of 5 cells. In fact, one simulation takes about 90 minutes on a Pentium 4 PC (3.06
GHz) using MatLab 7.2. If we wish to extend these ideas to large cellular systems
then we need new multiscale algorithms which will still model intrinsic noise in a
delayed setting but will overcome the issues of small stepsizes. This has been considered in the non-delay case by for example Tian and Burrage [11] through their
use of τ -leap methods, and similar ideas are needed in the delay setting. This is
the subject of further work, along with considerations on how to combine spatial
and temporal aspects when dealing with the lack of homogeneity within a cell.
