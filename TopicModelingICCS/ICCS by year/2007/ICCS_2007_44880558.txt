Abstract. In this paper a possibility of neural network application
to data processing in magnetotelluric method is studied. The modular neural system, consisting of three multi-layer neural networks, is
used for obtaining geoelectric model of lithosphere basing on amplitude
and phase MT curves. Cases of two and three ﬂat lithosphere layers are
considered.
Keywords: magnetotelluric method, multi-layer neural networks.

Introduction

Magnetotelluric (MT) is one of the most commonly used passive geophysical
method. That method apply measuring of ﬂuctuations in natural electric (E)
and magnetic (H) ﬁelds in orthogonal directions at the surface of the Earth to
determining the conductivity structure of the Earth. Apart from its usefulness in
deep lithosphere research and hydrocarbon prospecting, the precise knowledge
of the conductivity structure is of major importance in several respects. For
example, it has been shown [4] that sites of the Earth’s surface lying close to
conductive edges are the most sensitive sites for the recording of low frequency
signals that have been found to precede earthquakes [7].
The fundamental theory of magnetotelluric was ﬁrst propounded by Tikhonov
[6], and Cagniard [2]. Magnetotelluric data, called amplitude and phase sounding curves, are usually obtained by processing of measured time series, which
describe electromagnetic variations in particular point on Earth surface. Sounding curves are next interpreted with various inversion method. The ﬁnal results are geoelectrical cross-sections (or maps) which are usually correlated with
geology.

Data Processing

As a results of MT measurements time series of electric (Ex, Ey) and magnetic
(Hx, Hy) components are calculated to spectral domain using Fast Fourier Transformation. Such components are connected by formula which includes impedance
tensor [Z]:
E = ZH

where
Z=

Zxx Zxy
Zyx Zyy

(2)

For horizontally layered Earth Zxx = Zyy = 0 and Zxy = −Zyx (Cagniard
model), so we can obtain magnetotelluric amplitude and phase curves by:

Neural Approach

The applied modular neural system consists of three multi-layer artiﬁcial neural
networks (ANNs). The ﬁrst one - ANN1 - recognizes how many layers constitute the studied fragment of lithosphere - only two-layer and three-layer cases
are considered. If the number of lithosphere layers is equal to two then input
vector is put into the second neural network ANN2. Otherwise it is put into
the third neural net ANN3. Networks ANN2 and ANN3 calculate parameters of
one-dimensional model.
Two various form of the input vector components [x1 , ..., xn ] for ANNs were
tested. In the ﬁrst case vector components were scaled using the following forms
x2i−1 =

ln (ωi )
k1

(5)
x2i =

φ(ωi )
k2 ,

where ω was frequency in logarithmic scale, was resistance, φ was phase, k1
and k2 were constant values, calculated during data preprocessing in such a way
that components of input vectors xi belonged to interval [0, 1], i = 1, ..., 55. In
the second case integrated form of input data were used
x2i−1 =

ωi+1
ωi
ω55
ω1

k3

(ωi )dω
(ωi )dω

(6)
x2i =

ωi+1
φ(ωi )dω
ωi
k4 ωω55 φ(ωi )dω

,

where i = 1, ..., 54 and constant values k3 and k4 were used for component
normalization as in the case of input data representation given by formula (5).

Results

Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used as a measure of accuracy
both in the net ANN2 calculating parameters for two-layer model and in the net
ANN3 used for three-layer model. The error is given by the formula
MAPE =

100
n

m

i=1 j=1

yij − dij
,
dij

(7)

where yij is the jth component of output vector of an ANN if the ith input
vector is presented, dij is the jth component of correct output vector if the ith
input vector is presented, m is the number of output vector components and n
is the number of presented examples.
Both ANN2 and ANN3 were perceptrons having one hidden layer. In both
cases it turned out that twenty hidden neurons was an optimal number. Sigmoidal mapping was used as an activation function of hidden neurons and both
sigmoidal and linear neurons were tested in the output layer - see Tables 1
and 2. Components of output signals were scaled so they belonged to interval
[0, 1]. Back-propagation and momentum were used as training algorithms. Both
scaled representation of input data (see formula (5)) and integrated representation (formula (6)) were tested. Various learning constatnts were tested as well.
For both networks (ANN2 and ANN3) training process consisted of 8000 epochs.
In two-layer case the training set consisted of 1072 elements and testing set
had 358 elements. Results are presented in Table 1.

In three-layer case the training set consisted of 1147 elements and testing set
had 383 elements. Results are presented in Table 2.
The net ANN1, recognizing to which model (two- or three-layer) belonged
given curves, consisted of ﬁve neurons in the hidden layer and two output neurons. If the ﬁrst component of output signal was greater then the two-layer model
was chosen. The network achieved 100% of correctness after 700 training epochs.

Concluding Remarks

The presented investigations concerns possibility of artiﬁcial neural systems applications in MT method. It should be stressed that presented tests are preliminary and 2D and 3D cases must be studied. Anyway the obtained results are
promising and can be a contribution to studies concerning eﬃciency of modular
neural systems ([1], [3], [5]).
