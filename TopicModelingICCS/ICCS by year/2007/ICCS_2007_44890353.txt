Abstract. The diameter diam(H) of a (directed) graph H is the maximum value computed over the lengths of all shortest (directed) paths in
H. Given a bridgeless connected graph G, the oriented diameter OD(G)
is given by OD(G) = min{diam(H) : H is an orientation of G}. In
this paper, we show that OD(G) ≤ 32 diam(G) + 1 for every connected
bridgeless interval graph G. Further, for every 2-connected proper interval graph G, we show OD(G) ≤ 54 diam(G) + 1 if diam(G) ≤ 3 and
OD(G) ≤ 54 diam(G) , otherwise. All the bounds are sharp and improve
earlier estimations obtained by Fomin et al.
Keywords: Diameter, orientation, oriented diameter, interval graph,

Introduction

Given a (directed) graph H, the distance from a vertex x to a vertex y in H,
denoted by dH (x, y), is the length of a shortest (directed) path from x to y in H.
The maximum value of distances, denoted by diam(H), is called the diameter
of H. When H is a graph, diam(H) is ﬁnite if and only if H is connected; when
H is a directed graph, diam(H) is ﬁnite if and only if H is strongly connected.
Let G be a graph. An orientation of G is a directed graph obtained from G
by assigning a direction to each edge of G. The oriented diameter of G, OD(G),
is given by
OD(G) = min{diam(H) : H is an orientation of G}.
Clearly if G is not connected or has a bridge (i.e., a cut-edge) then OD(G) is
not ﬁnite. A celebrated theorem of Robbins [11] asserts OD(G) is ﬁnite if G is
both connected and bridgeless. Any orientation H of G with diam(H) = OD(G)
is called a minimum diameter orientation of G. The problem of evaluating the

value OD(G) for an arbitrary graph G is very diﬃcult. In fact it is NP-complete
to determine whether a graph G satisﬁes OD(G) ≤ 2, [2].
Chv´
atal and Thomassen [2] initiated the investigation of the relation of the two
parameters OD(G) and diam(G). They proved that OD(G) ≤ 2(diam(G))2 +
2diam(G) for every connected bridgeless graph G. Minimum diameter orientations of various families of graphs have already been studied by Gutin [6], Koh
and Tan [7], Solt´es [12], Plesnik [10], Boesch and Tindell [1], and others. We direct the reader to the survey of Koh and Tay [8] for a comprehensive discussion
on the minimum diameter orientations of graphs.
A graph G is an interval graph if there is a family of intervals Iv , v ∈ V (G), in
a real line such that two vertices u, v are adjacent in G if and only if Iu , Iv overlap.
If such a family of intervals can be chosen so that no interval is completely
contained in another, then the graph G is called a proper interval graph. Recently,
Fomin et al. [3] proved that, for every connected bridgeless interval graph G,
OD(G) ≤ 32 diam(G) + 25
2 and, for every 2-connected proper interval graph G,
OD(G) ≤ 54 diam(G) + 29
2 .
The purpose of this paper is to sharpen these two upper bounds. More precisely, we show that OD(G) ≤ 32 diam(G) + 1 for every connected bridgeless
interval graph G. There are (proper) interval graphs of arbitrarily larger diameter achieving this bound. Further, we show that, for every 2-connected proper
interval graph G, OD(G) ≤ 45 diam(G) + 1 if diam(G) ≤ 3 and OD(G) ≤
5
4 diam(G) , otherwise. Again the bounds can be attained by appropriate 2connected proper interval graphs.

Connected Bridgeless Interval Graphs

Interval graphs can be characterized in many ways, cf. [5]. According to Gilmore
and Hoﬀman [4], a graph G is an interval graph if and only if the maximal cliques
of G can be linearly ordered so that, for every vertex v of G, the maximal cliques
containing vertex v occur consecutively in the ordering.
Let G be a connected bridgeless interval graph and let C : C1 , C2 , . . . , Cr
be an ordering of the maximal cliques of G that satisﬁes the above-mentioned
property. Since G is bridgeless, every Ci has at least 3 vertices. When r = 1, G
is a complete graph, i.e., G = Kn where n is the number of vertices of G. Plesnik
[10] has proved that OD(K4 ) = 3, and OD(Kn ) = 2 for all n ≥ 3 and n = 4 (cf.
also [1,9]). A minimum diameter orientation of K4 is depicted in Figure 1.

Suppose that G is not a complete graph, i.e., r ≥ 2. Let C : Ci1 , Ci2 , . . . , Cid
with 1 = i1 < i2 < · · · < id = r be chosen such that Cij ∩ Cij+1 = ∅ and
Cij ∩ Cij+1 +1 = ∅ for 1 ≤ j ≤ d − 1. Clearly, d = diam(G). Denote Sj =
Cij ∩ Cij+1 , 1 ≤ j ≤ d − 1. Then Sj is contained in Cm for ij ≤ m ≤ ij+1 . Since
Cij ∩ Cij+1 +1 = ∅, Sj ∩ Sj+1 = ∅ for 1 ≤ j ≤ d − 1.
When |Sj | = 1, denote by zj the only vertex in Sj ; otherwise when |Sj | ≥ 2,
choose arbitrarily two vertices zj , zj in Sj . Call Cij bad if |Sj−1 | = |Sj | = 1
(2 ≤ j ≤ d − 1), and good otherwise. Denote by the number of bad maximal
cliques (in C ). Then ≤ d − 2 = diam(G) − 2.
We orient G using the following steps:
(1) If |S1 | = 1, arbitrarily choose a vertex w ∈ C1 −{z1 } let w → x → z1 → w for
all x ∈ C1 −{w, z1 }; if |S1 | ≥ 2, let z1 → z1 → x → z1 for all x ∈ C1 −{z1 , z1 }.
Note that this gives a partial orientation of C1 . Similarly, if |Sd−1 | = 1,
arbitrarily choose a vertex w ∈ Cr − {zd−1 } let w → x → zd−1 → w for
all x ∈ Cr − {w, zd−1 }; if |Sd−1 | ≥ 2, let zd−1 → zd−1 → x → zd−1 for all
x ∈ Cr − {zd−1 , zd−1 }. Again this gives a partial orientation of Cr .
(2) For the ﬁrst 2 bad cliques Cij , orient v → zj−1 → zj → v for v ∈
Cij − {zj−1 , zj } and for the remaining 2 bad maximal cliques Cij , orient
v → zj → zj−1 → v for v ∈ Cij − {zj−1 , zj };
(3) For each good clique Cij with |Sj−1 | = 1 and |Sj | ≥ 2, orient v → zj →
zj → v for any v ∈ Cij − {zj , zj }. For each good clique with |Sj | = 1 and
|Sj−1 | ≥ 2, orient v → zj−1 → zj−1 → v for v ∈ Cij − {zj−1 , zj−1 };
(4) For each good clique Cij with |Sj−1 | ≥ 2 and |Sj | ≥ 2, we let zj−1 →
zj−1 , zj−1 → zj → zj → zj−1 , and {zj−1 , zj } → v → {zj−1 , zj } for all
v ∈ Cij − {zj , zj , zj−1 , zj−1 };
(5) For each Cm ∈ C−C , we must have ij < m < ij+1 for some j. (Note that the
ordering of maximal cliques ensures that Cm contains Sj and in particular
zj and zj .) When |Sj | ≥ 2, for each v ∈ Cm − (Ci1 ∪ Ci2 ∪ . . . ∪ Cid ), let
v → zj → zj → v. When |Sj | = 1, we select a vertex w ∈ Cm − {zj } in
such a way that the preference is given to a vertex in Cij ∪ Cij+1 . Note
that the edge wzj may or may not be oriented by the previous steps. If
it has not been oriented, then we orient it arbitrarily. Now for each vertex
v ∈ Cm − (Ci1 ∪ Ci2 ∪ . . . ∪ Cid ), we assign directions to edges vw, vzj in such
a way that v, w, zj form a directed triangle;
(6) Finally, for each edge which has not been oriented by the above steps, we
assign arbitrarily a direction to it.
Lemma 1. Let G be a connected bridgeless interval graph which is not complete
and let H be an orientation of G obtained using the above steps. Then
diam(H) ≤

diam(G) + 1.

Proof. Let v be a vertex of G. Then v ∈ Ci for some 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Assume
ij ≤ i ≤ ij+1 , i.e., v ∈ Cij ∪ Cij +1 ∪ · · · ∪ Cij+1 . When |Sj | = 1, it follows from

steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 that dH (v, zj ) ≤ 2 and dH (zj , v) ≤ 2; when |Sj+1 | ≥ 2, by
steps 1, 3, 4, and 5, dH (v, zj ) ≤ 1, dH (zj , v) ≤ 1, and dH (zj , zj ) = 1.
Let u, v be any two vertices of G. Then u ∈ Ca and v ∈ Cb for some 1 ≤ a, b ≤
r. If ij ≤ a, b ≤ ij+1 for some j = 1, 2, . . . , d − 1, then
dH (u, v) ≤

dH (u, zj ) + dH (zj , v) ≤ 4
if |Sj | = 1;
dH (u, zj ) + dH (zj , zj ) + dH (zj , v) ≤ 3 if |Sj | ≥ 2.

Suppose that ij ≤ a < ij+1 ≤ ik ≤ b < ik+1 where 1 ≤ j < k ≤ d − 1. By step
2, dH (zj , zk ) ≤ diam(G) − 2 + 2 and dH (zk , zj ) ≤ diam(G) − 2 + 2 . Hence
dH (u, v) ≤ dH (u, zj ) + dH (zj , zk ) + dH (zk , v) ≤ 2 + diam(G) − 2 +
≤ 2 + diam(G) +

OD(G) ≤

diam(G) + 1.

Proof. The statement follows from Lemma 1 and the fact that OD(Kn ) ≤ 3.
The sharpness of the upper bound given in Theorem 1 is shown by Figure 2,
where an orientation of diameter 32 n + 1 is given for an interval graph of
diameter n.

2-Connected Proper Interval Graphs

In this section, we focus on the minimum diameter orientations of 2-connected
proper interval graphs G. We shall adopt the same notations as in Section 2.

In particular, C1 , C2 , . . . , Cr is an ordering of the maximal cliques of G in the
sense of Gilmore and Hoﬀman. Since G is a proper interval graph, the ordering
is essentially unique. We also let Ci1 , Ci2 , . . . , Cid be the cliques as deﬁned in
Section 2. We begin with the lemma (which does not assume G is 2-connected).
Lemma 2. Let G be a connected proper interval graph. Then for 1 ≤ j ≤ d − 1
and ij < m < ij+1 , Cm ⊆ Cij ∪ Cij+1 .
Proof. Suppose that Cm contains a vertex w that is not in Cij ∪ Cij+1 . Since w
is not in Cij ∪ Cij+1 , w is not adjacent to a vertex x ∈ Cij and not adjacent to
a vertex y ∈ Cij+1 . Let z be any vertex in Cij ∩ Cij+1 . Since Cij ∩ Cij+1 ⊆ Cm ,
z is in Cm and hence adjacent to w. So z is adjacent to w, x, and y. Since G
is a proper interval graph, it does not contain an induced K1,3 . This implies
that x and y are adjacent (as otherwise the vertices w, x, y, z induce a K1,3 ). In
particular, x, y, z are pairwise adjacent.
Consider a maximal clique Cm containing x, y, z. Note Cm is distinct from
Cij , Cm and Cij+1 . If m > m, then x is must be in Cm and hence adjacent to
w, a contradiction. On the other hand, if m < m, then y is in Cm and adjacent
to w, also a contradiction.
From now on, we assume G is a 2-connected proper interval graph. Lemma 2
implies that V (G) = Ci1 ∪Ci2 ∪· · ·∪Cid . As in Section 2, if |Sj | = |Cij ∩Cij+1 | ≥ 2,
let zj , zj be any two ﬁxed vertices in Sj , and if |Sj | = 1, let zj be the only vertex in
Sj . Since G is 2-connected, in the case when |Sj | = 1, there exist xj ∈ Cij − {zj }
and xj+1 ∈ Cij+1 − {zj } such that xj and xj+1 are adjacent.
We next show how to orient G and to do so we consider several cases. In
each case, we only give a partial orientation of G and the orientations of the
remaining edges may be given arbitrarily.
Case 1. diam(G) = 2.
– (1) If |S1 | = 1, let x2 → x1 , v → z1 → w for all v ∈ Ci1 − z1 and
w ∈ Ci2 − z1 , x1 → v for all v ∈ Ci1 − {x1 , z1 }, and w → x2 for all
w ∈ Ci2 − {x2 , z1 }.
– (2) If |S1 | ≥ 2, let v → z1 → z1 → v for all v ∈ V (G) \ {z1 , z1 }.
Case 2. diam(G) = 3.
– (1) Suppose |S1 | = |S2 | = 1. Note that it is possible to select x2 , x2 from
Ci2 − {z1 , z2 }. Let x1 → z1 → x2 → x1 , z1 → z2 , and x2 → x3 → z2 → x2 .
For all u ∈ Ci1 − {x1 , z1 } let x1 → u → z1 , for all v ∈ Ci2 − {z1 , z2 , x2 , x2 }
let z2 → v → z1 , and for all w ∈ Ci3 − {z2 , x3 } let x3 → w → z2 .
– (2) Suppose that exactly one of |S1 | and |S2 | equals 1. Assume |S1 | = 1 (the
case when |S2 | = 1 can be handled in a similar way. Let v → z1 → x1 → v
for v ∈ Ci1 − {z1 , x1 }, u → z2 → z2 → u for u ∈ Ci2 ∪ Ci3 − {z2 , z2 }.
– (3) Suppose |S1 | ≥ 2 and |S2 | ≥ 2. Let z1 → z2 and z2 → z1 . Let v →
z1 → z1 → v for v ∈ Ci1 − {z1 , z1 }, and u → z2 → z2 → u for u ∈
Ci2 ∪ Ci3 − S1 − {z2 , z2 }.

Case 3. diam(G) ≥ 4.
Let Cik be a bad clique with 3 ≤ k ≤ d − 3. Call Cik 2-bad if Cik+1 is also
bad. Choose a set L of 2-bad cliques Cij1 , Cij2 , . . . , Cijη so that the following
properties are satisﬁed:
(P1) the set contains as many 2-bad cliques as possible;
(P2) ijk+1 = ijk +1 ;
(P3) ij1 + ij2 + · · · + ijη is minimum.
Note that L does not contain all 2-bad cliques. For instance, if Cik−1 is in
L, then Cik cannot be in L even though it may be 2-bad. Denote by M
be the set of all bad but not 2-bad cliques Cik with 3 ≤ k ≤ d − 2 such
that Cik−1 is not in L and |M| = . Then the number of good cliques in
C − {Ci1 , Ci2 , Cid−1 , Cid } is d − 4 − 2η − . When Cik ∈ M, we have Cik+1
is either good or Cid−1 and hence ≤ (d − 4 − 2η − ) + 1.
– (1) If |S1 | = 1, let x2 → x1 → z1 , x1 → v → z1 for all v ∈ Ci1 − {z1 , x1 },
and u → x2 → z1 → u for all u ∈ Ci2 − {z2 , x2 }; If |S1 | ≥ 2, let z1 → v → z1
for all v ∈ Ci1 − {z1 , z1 }, and u → z1 → z1 → u for all u ∈ Ci2 − S1 .
– (2) If |Sd−1 | = 1, let xd−1 → xd → zd−1 , v → xd−1 → zd−1 → v for all
v ∈ Cid−1 − {zd−1 , xd−1 }, and xd → u → zd−1 for all u ∈ Cid − {zd−1 , xd };
If |Sd−1 | ≥ 2, let v → zd−1 → zd−1 → v for all v ∈ Cid−1 − {zd−1 , zd−1 } and
zd−1 → u → zd−1 for all u ∈ Cid − Sd−1 .
– (3) Suppose Cij ∈ L. We only show how to give orientations of the edges
in Cij and Cij+1 for ij1 ≤ ij ≤ ij η . (When ij η < ij ≤ ijη , the edges
2
2
are oriented reversely.) Let xij+1 → xij , v → zj−1 → zj → v for all v ∈
Cij − {zj , zj−1 }, and u → zj → zj+1 → u for all u ∈ Cij+1 − {zj , zj+1 }.
– (4) For the ﬁrst (with respect to the order of C) 2 cliques Cik in M, let
v → zk−1 → zk → v for all v ∈ Cik − {zk−1 , zk }; for the other cliques in M,
we orient the edges reversely.
– (5) Suppose that Cij with 3 ≤ j ≤ d − 2 is a good clique. If |Sj−1 | = 1
and |Sj | ≥ 2, let v → zj → zj → v for any v ∈ Cij − {zj , zj }; if |Sj | = 1
and |Sj−1 | ≥ 2, let v → zj−1 → zj−1 → v for v ∈ Cij − {zj−1 , zj−1 }; if
|Sj−1 | ≥ 2 and |Sj | ≥ 2, let zj−1 → zj−1 , zj−1 → zj → zj → zj−1 , and
{zj−1 , zj } → v → {zj−1 , zj } for all v ∈ Cij − {zj , zj , zj−1 , zj−1 }.
Theorem 2. Let G be a 2-connected proper interval graph. Then
OD(G) ≤

+ 1 if diam(G) ≤ 3;
if diam(G) ≥ 4.

Proof. When G is complete, OD(G) ≤ 3 ≤ 54 diam(G) + 1 by Theorem 1.
When G is not complete and satisﬁes diam(G) ≤ 3, it can be veriﬁed easily from
the orientations given in Case 1 and Case 2 that OD(G) ≤ 54 diam(G) + 1. So
suppose that diam(G) ≥ 4.
Let u, v be any two vertices of G. Without loss of generality assume u ∈ Cij
and v ∈ Cik for some j ≤ k. When k − 1 ≤ j ≤ k, according to steps 1 and 2 in
Case 3, dH (u, v) ≤ 5 if j = k = 1 or j = k = d and, according steps 3, 4, and 5
in Case 3, dH (u, v) ≤ 3 if j = k = 1, d. When j = k − 1, dH (u, v) ≤ 4 according
to steps 1-5 in Case 3.

Suppose now j < k − 1. Let u ∈ Ci1 − {z1 , x1 } if |S1 | = 1 and u ∈ Ci1 − S1
if |S1 | ≥ 2, and let v ∈ Cid − {zd−1 , xd } if |Sd−1 | = 1 and v ∈ Cid − Sd−1 if
|Sd−1 | ≥ 2.
Claim: dH (u, v) ≤ dH (u , v ) and dH (v, u) ≤ dH (v , u ).
Proof of Claim: We only prove dH (u, v) ≤ dH (u , v ) as the proof of the other
inequality is similar. Denote Pt = Cit ∪ Cit+1 with Cit ∈ L. If u does not lie in
Pt for any t, then dH (u, zj ) ≤ 2 ≤ dH (u , zj ); If u lies in Pt for some t, then
3 ≤ t ≤ d − 3 and either t = j or t = j − 1, so dH (u, zt+1 ) ≤ 3 ≤ dH (u , zt+1 ).
If v does not lie in Pt for any t, then dH (zk−1 , v) ≤ 2 ≤ dH (zk−1 , v ); If v
lies in Pp for some p, then 3 ≤ p ≤ d − 3 and either p = k or p = k − 1, so
dH (zp−1 , v) ≤ 3 ≤ dH (zp−1 , v ). So
dH (u, v) ≤ dH (u, zr ) + dH (zr , zm ) + dH (zm , v)
≤ dH (u , zr ) + dH (zr , zm ) + dH (zm , v ) = dH (u , v )
where r = t + 1 if u lies in Pt for some t, and r = j otherwise; m = p − 1 if v
lies in Pp for some p, and m = k − 1 otherwise.
To estimate dH (u , v ) and dH (v , u ), ﬁrst we have
dH (u , v ) = dH (u , z2 ) + dH (z2 , zd−2 ) + dH (zd−2 , v )

When diam(G) = 1, the upper bound of OD(G) in Theorem 2 is achieved by a
minimum diameter orientation of K4 (see Figure 1). The following proposition
from [3] shows that the upper bound in Theorem 2 is sharp for diam(G) ≥ 4.
Proposition 1. [3] For d ≥ 3, there is a 2-connected proper interval graph G
with diam(G) ≥ d and OD(G) ≥ 54 diam(G).
The sharpness of upper bounds of OD(G) for the cases when 2 ≤ diam(G) ≤ 3 is
given by Propositions 2 and 3 below. Indeed, it can be veriﬁed that the digraphs
in Figures 3 and 4 are the minimum diameter orientations of their underlying
graphs. Therefore we have
