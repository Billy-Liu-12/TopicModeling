Abstract. Based on numerical simulation, the construction analysis of a sub-sea
tunnel is rewarded. Under the condition that the lateral pressure coefficient is
equal to 0.5, two common construction methods that are processes of whole
section excavation, schemes of benching excavation are analyzed. The result of
that method of benching excavation will slightly disturb the surrounding rock
compared the displacements of key-points and the distributions of plastic area
on the surface of wall rock. Finally, the conclusion is reached that the
reasonable bench pace between benching excavation is around 10 meters is
proposed by analyzing tunnel stability under different bench lengths. The
conclusion can direct the construction of the tunnel better.
Keywords: sub-sea tunnel, lateral pressure coefficient, plastic area.

1 Introduction
In recent years, experts have done much technical research on the construction of subsea tunnels. They researched the minimal rock cover of sub-sea tunnels by means of
engineering analogy and numerical simulations. Many valuable results Have been
acquired [1],[2]. However, study on the sub-sea tunnels is in the initial steps. In view
of construction mechanics, this paper researches the effect of minimal rock cover
about crucial profile (K28+800) on different excavation methods and construction
sequences [3].

2 Geological Conditions
Geological construction in a tunnel zone is simple and the rock mass is intact. There
are a few large faults. A few small faults may exist because of construct of fault
around this zone. Most bores show a lot of growth crannies in the part of tunnel zone.
The seismic data show that crannies or dikes may exist in eleven places on the shore.

3 Numerical Models
In a numerical model, the z-axis is the direction of the tunnel’s axes. The
direction vertical to the tunnel axes in the plane is the x-axis. The y-axis is

vertical to the tunnel axes in the profile. The calculation range is between 0 meter
and 160 meters on the x-axis. The range is between 0 meters and 10 meters on the
y-axis. The range is 50 meters on the z-axis. The distance from the vault of the
tunnel cave to the bottom of the numerical model is 80 meters. The horizontal
boundaries have been put on both sides of the model. The vertical boundaries are
put on the bottom. The top of model is free. The initial stress fields are caused by
gravity on the model. Then the construction sequence is simulated. The
hydrostatic pressure on the top of the model simulates the effect of seawater. The
high level is 4.64 meter up the sea level. Various mechanical parameters of rock
mass are shown in Table 1.

4 Result and Analyis Under Different Excavation Methods
The eight key-points on the tunnel wall are picked up. The lateral press coefficient is
0.5 and the excavation methods of whole section as well as benching are chosen.
Then the displacement of key-points is computed and compared with each other
(Fig.1 & Table 2). The results show the displacement of key-points under benching
excavation is smaller than that of the whole section [4], [5].

5 Analysis of Construct Sequence
The step method is used extensively during tunnel construction. But different step
lengths may affect tunnel stability in different ways, so it is important to make sure
that the step length is reasonable. In view of benching excavation, this paper simulates
the excavation effect under different space. Three kinds of step lengths such as 1D,
2D and 3D, are analyzed by numerical simulation [6].
The curvature of different points in the tunnel vault and in the rock cover is
rewarded under three different step lengths (Fig.2.).

Fig. 2. Displacement compare in tunnel rock cover after excavation

The displacement contrast curve of crucial points in rock cover shows that the
different construction sequences affect the final displacement of rock cover. The
displacement compare curve of crucial points on tunnel vault shows that the vertical
displacement is greatest and the horizontal displacement is small. The displacement
movement stabilizes when the distance between frontal step and back step is about 10
meters. So the distance between two steps over about 10 meters is reasonable when
using benching excavation.

6 Discussions
According to analysis, engineering experience and excavation methods, the upper and
down benching excavation method may decrease the effect of disturbances and protect
the stability of rock mass. Meanwhile it can reduce the cost of tunnel excavation.
The different construction sequences slightly affects the final displacement of rock
mass. It produces the large displacement near the tunnel face. It affects to choose the
reasonable support sequence during construction. The distance between two steps
over about 10 meters is reasonable when using upper and down benching excavation.
The stable zone of the vault displacement along the z-axis direction is about 10
meters.
