Abstract. By use of the relationship between uncertain fuzzy number and
linguistic number, a linguistic fuzzy method to assess the sustainability of
Petroleum Corporation as one kind of hybrid multi-attribute decision making
problems is put forward. Simultaneously, the attribute weight of decision making
problem is derived from the maximum entropy model. The OWA operator is
used to aggregate the attribute information. Finally, it is illustrated by a
numerical example that this method is feasible and effective.
Keywords: sustainability, hybrid multiple attribute decision making, linguistic
fuzzy number, petroleum corporation.

1 Introduction
The assessment of Petroleum Corporation’s sustainability involves economy, society
and environment. The assessment attributes may be quantitative and qualitative. Other
researchers usually assess it with crisp numbers. However, because of the complex
geological structure, it would be practical to employ uncertain number to express some
of the attributes. For the qualitative attributes, decision-makers sometimes use fuzzy
linguistic terms [1] as the assessment information. Consequently, the assessment of
Petroleum Corporation’s sustainability is the hybrid attributes decision making issue.
For solving the problem, a linguistic fuzzy method is proposed. Firstly, using the
relationship between the uncertainty fuzzy number and the fuzzy linguistic terms, we
transform the hybrid attributes into a uniform fuzzy linguistic attribute in order to make
the assessment results being in good according with our understanding. Secondly, when
selecting the weight of decision attributes, the attitude value is used for us to fully
consider the risk attitude of decision makers. Finally, attribute values are aggregated by
OWA (Ordered weighted averaging) operator.

If the weight vector of attributes is taken as a kind of attitudinal-character
probability, under a certain attitude, the attribute weight should be selected which can

2.2 The 2-Tuple Linguistic Term and Uncertainty Fuzzy Number
Let

S = {S 0 ,

, S g } be a linguistic term set,

where 2 ≤ g ≤ 14 . The semantics of the terms is

given by fuzzy numbers defined in [0,1] interval. A way to characterize a fuzzy number
is to use a representation based on parameter of its membership function. Sometimes
the linguistic terms can be representing by triangle fuzzy number, such as Si = (ai , bi , ci ) ,
where ai = i−g1 (1 ≤ i ≤ g), bi = gi (0 ≤ i ≤ g), ci = i+g1 (0 ≤ i ≤ g −1), a0 = 0, cg = 1.
The linguistic information is represented by a 2-tuple linguistic model [3] ( Si , α i ) . The
2-tuple linguistic operator can be defined as follow:
[3]

: Let S ={S0, S1, , Sg } be a linguistic term set and β ∈ [0, g ] is a value
supporting the result of a symbolic aggregation operation, then the 2-tuple that
expresses the equivalent information to β is obtained with the following function Δ :
Definition 2

Δ : [0, g ] → S × [ −0.5, 0.5)

Δ ( β ) = ( Si , α )

(4)

Where i = round ( β ), α = β − i, α ∈ [ −0.5, 0.5) and “round” is the rounding operation.
Definition 3[3]: Let I be an uncertain fuzzy number. Then I can be transforming into
linguistic 2-tuple set by the function τ IS : [0, 1] → F ( ST ) .
T

τ IS ( I ) = {(Sk , ωk ) /k ∈{0, , g}}

ωk = max
min{μ I ( y ), μS ( y )}

Where μI (.), μS (.) are the membership functions associated with the terms I and S k .

Definition 4[4]: Let τ ( I ) = {( S0 , ω0 ), ( S1 , ω1 ), , ( S g , ωg )} be a fuzzy set that represents a
numerical value I over the linguistic term set S. we obtain a numerical value that
represents the information from the fuzzy set by means of the
function χ : F ( ST ) → [0, g ] .

χτ ( I ) = χ ( F ( ST )) = χ {( S j , ω j ), j = 0, 1, , g} = ∑ gj =0 jω j ( ∑ gj =0 ω j )−1 = β

(7)

The value β is easily transformed into a linguistic 2-tuple using the definition 2.

3 The Aggregation Approach
Consider a multi-attribute decision making problem with m alternatives x1, x2, , xm ,
and n decision attributes p1, p2, , pn . Each alternative is assessed with respect to each
attribute. The assessment scores assigned to the attributes are the components of
decision matrix denoted by R = (rij ) m×n , where rij is a numerical value or uncertainty
fuzzy number. The decision making steps are given as follows:
Step 1. Construct the decision matrix.
Step 2. Normalize the decision matrix R = (rij )n×n to matrix R′ =(rij )n×n . For instance, the
elements rij =(aij ,bij ,cij ) of the decision matrix R=(rij )n×n are triangular fuzzy numbers,
then r = (aij , bij , cij ), j ∈ B , and c+j = maxcij , j ∈B . Any decision matrix with entries being
+
+
+

cj cj cj

numerical values can be normalized using the same method mentioned above.
Step 3. Using equations (4-7), transform the attribute values into 2-tuple linguistic
terms. We get a decision matrix P=(pij )m×n with entries being 2-tuple linguistic values.
Step 4. Calculate the comprehensive attribute values. The weight vector
ω∗ = (ω1∗, ,ωk∗, ,ωn∗)T , k =1, , n can be got by model (∗) .Then the comprehensive attributes

value ti ,i =1,2,…,mof each alternative can be aggregated by the OWA operator：
ti = φQ ( pi1,

n

, pin ) = Δ( ∑ ωk∗Δ −1 ( pik′ ))
k =1

Where pik′ is the kth largest value in the set { pi1 ,
Step 5. Rank the alternatives x1 , x2 ,

4 Numerical Example
Let X = {x1 , , x9 } denotes nine Petroleum Corporations set, which are
BP、 Exxon-Mobil、 Shell、 Anni、 CNPC、 SINOPEC、 CNOOC、 Statoil、 Petrobras.
The attributes of sustainability of Petroleum Corporation are given in table 1.

The values of sub-attributes are given according to the following principle: The
numerical values are given by 2004 annually report directly or through simple
calculated. Especially, the data of oil and gas surplus workable reserves attributes take
the form of the triangle fuzzy numbers. These two triangles fuzzy numbers sets are
constructed according to the reserves data in 2003 annals and in 2004 annals and the
reserves in 2003 annals go through 3%'s fluctuation. The society benefit and
environment harmonious attributes gain from investigation.

Suppose that the decision makers hold the normal risk attitude, then attributes
weight can be derived from the model (∗) , which is ω∗ = (.1620,.1791,.1980 , .2190,.2421)T .By
(8), the ranking order of nine petroleum corporations is x2 x1 x3 x5 x9 x4 x6 x7 x8.
The appraisal result is reasonable. We know the sustainability of Petroleum
Corporation is close connecting with its comprehensive ability. This ranking order is
the same as the order of their comprehensive ability that US “petroleum intelligence
weekly” magazine given in 2003. It can be conclude that the assessment method given
is objective and valid.

5 Conclusions
This paper develops an assessment approach of Petroleum Corporation’s sustainability,
and it is illustrated by a numerical example that this method is feasible and effective.
Using the relationship between the uncertainty fuzzy number and the linguistic fuzzy
term, we transform the hybrid attribute values into the 2-tuple linguistic values which
makes the assessment results being more intuitionist and more understandable. In the
process of selecting the weight of decision attributes, we consider the attitudes of
decision-makers, and in the meantime, we aggregated the attribute values by utilizing
the OWA operator which makes the assessment results being more objective and
scientific.
