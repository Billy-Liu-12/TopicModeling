Abstract. The Meshfree Local Petrov-Garlerkin Method (MLPG) was
introduced to study the behavior of extra-long and large-diameter piles. The
nonlinear behavior of the soil and pile shaft materials was firstly analyzed,
based on these, the solving steps of MLPG was put forward involving the
elastic-plastic model of soil and pile shaft reinforcement. Then a testing
example was analyzed in contrast to the Finite Element Method (FEM), and the
results indicated that the MLPG was of higher accuracy. Lastly, the MLPG was
applied to analyze the data of static test on a full scale extra-long pile to study
the behavior of pile.
Keywords: Pile foundation; Nonlinear; extra-long; MLPG method.

1 Introduction
For the past few years, the extra-long pile with large-diameter was more and more
applied in the engineering practice. Although it takes higher bearing capacity, the
fully exertion of it involved larger displacement. So it is important to study on the
calculating method of settlement [1]. The finite element method (FEM) is the most
highly developed tools to analyze mechanical problems, but its shape function is
constructed based on the element, when analyzing the problems such as the large
deflection and the contact, the serious distortion of element in FEM will cause the
method unworkable. Recent years, a new numerical method termed “Meshfree
Method” was put forward, in which the shape function is based on the nodes, can
conquer some of the shortcomings in FEM. There are a number of meshfree methods,
such as the element free Galerkin (EFG) method, the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin
(MLPG) method [2], meshless point collocation method, PCM and so on. Herein, the
MLPG is studied with the method considering elastic-plastic property of the material.

2 Basic Equation of MLPG
In MLPG, MLS approximation is employed to create shape functions for field
variable approximation, and penalty method is introduced herein to enforce the
essential boundary condition. The weak form for a node, say, node I, based on the
local weighted residual method can be stated as [2]:

Γu

Where WI is the weight or test function, and we use the same weight function for all
equations involved. The σij,j is the tensor of stress, bi is the tensor of external body
force, ui is the test displacement on the boundary, ui is the real displacement of the
node i on the boundary. α is the penalty factor.
Using the divergence theorem, we obtain:

Where Γ s = Ls ∪ Γus ∪ Γ ut .
Then the formula (2) can be transformed to:

When the calculating domain is located entirely in the problem domain, integrals
related to Γus and Γut vanish, and the formula (3) can be simplified as:

3 Elastic-Plastic Models of Soil and Reinforcement Concrete
3.1 Elastic-Plastic Model for Soil
The yield rule can be described as the function of stress in the soil. That is:
f * (σ ij ) = k f

(5)

Where f*(σij) is the function of stress, can use a certain form of stress invariant as
independent variable.
The rule put forward by Drucker and Prager is a form of the general Mises rule [3]:
αI 1 + J 2 = k

(6)

Where J2 is the second stress invariant, it is
1
2
2
2
J 2 = ⎡ (σ 1 − σ 2 ) + (σ 2 − σ 3 ) + (σ 3 − σ 1 ) ⎤
⎦
6⎣

(7)

Drucker and Prager also got the parameter in planar stress conditions:
α=

sin ϕ
3 3 + sin ϕ
2

k=

3c cos ϕ
3 + sin 2 ϕ

(8)

＝

Where the c and ϕ is the cohesion and inner friction angle. When ϕ 0, the formula
(6) turns to be Mises rule.

3.2 Elastic-Plastic Model for Pile Shaft Reinforcement Concrete
The behavior of reinforcement concrete is quite different from the soil, and the
Japanese scholar Noguchi [4] advised that the α and k can be got as:

α = 0.07 , k = − 0.88 f c'

Where the f c´is the compression strength of prism shape concrete.

elastic solution[5]. The beam is pictured in Fig. 1, and the result is shown in Table 1.

5 Analysis on a Test Pile by MLPG Method
A test pile[6], which was 60 meters long, and the calculating domain could be
determined as a rectangle domain which was 120 meters high and 120 meters long.

M.-h. Zhao, W. He, and Y. Wang

Because of the large slenderness ratio, the domain had to be represented by huge
number of scattered nodes, 26225 nodes were used here. The contour map of the
calculating domain can be got by MLPG, and due to the limit of the space, only
principal strain ε1 is shown in Fig.2
