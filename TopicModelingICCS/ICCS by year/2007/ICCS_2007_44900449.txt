Abstract. Reducing the location update cost has been a critical research issue
since the location update process requires heavy signaling traffics. One of the
solutions is employing the hierarchical structure in cellular networks to reduce
the location update cost. This paper is not only to measure the average location
update cost in cellular networks using the hierarchical structure but also to determine the degree of the hierarchy which minimizes the location update cost.
The paper proposes an advanced analytical model to obtain the optimal hierarchy in cellular networks, considering the update rates of the two registers, HLR
and VLR, as well as the update delays for them. Also, the paper provides the
threshold values as a guideline for the network administrator to design the optimal hierarchical structure in cellular networks.

Introduction

Many researchers have studied on diverse design problems of the location management schemes in cellular networks. The location management means the task finding
the location of the mobile station (MS) in order to receive the seamless services properly while the MS moves [1-3]. The cellular networks has two types of databases, the
home location register (HLR) and the visitor location register (VLR). The mobile
switching center (MSC) associated with a specific VLR is in charge of several base
station controllers (BSCs), lower control entities which in turn control several base
stations (BSs). The MSCs are connected to the backbone wired network such as public switching telephone network (PSTN). The network coverage area is divided into
smaller cell clusters called location areas (LAs). The VLR stores temporarily the
service profile of the MS roaming in the corresponding LA while the HLR stores
permanently the user profile and points to the VLR associated with the LA where the
user is currently located.

The total location update cost consists of the update cost of HLR and that of VLR.
Since the HLR is connected to many VLRs, it has heavy signaling traffics [4-6]. The
super location area (SLA) [7], a group of LAs, has been proposed for hierarchical
networks to reduce the location update cost of the HLR. The paper develops an analytical model to obtain the optimal size of SLA which minimizes the total location
update cost which includes both of the update rates of the HLR and VLR as well as
the update delays for them. Also, the paper provides threshold values as a guideline
that allows network administrators to design an optimal hierarchical structure for
cellular networks depending on the given environments.

2 The Location Management Using the Hierarchical Structure
An example of the architecture of the scheme is depicted in Figure 1 [7].
Each SLA consists of 7 LAs and again each LA has 7 cells as shown in Figure 1.
Each MSC/VLR pair covers an SLA. When an MS enters a new LA, the LA could
belong to either a different SLA or the same SLA. If the LA belongs to a different
SLA, both of the VLR and the HLR are updated to record the LA where the MS is
located. On the other hand, if the new LA belongs to the same SLA, only the VLR is
updated to record the new LA. The conventional scheme, which doesn’t employ any
hierarchy, should update not only the VLR but also the HLR whenever an MS enters a
new LA regardless of any SLA. The previous research [7] could not answer the questions like “What is the optimal number of levels in the hierarchy when designing cellular networks?”. The next section proposes an analytic model to answer the questions.

The followings assumptions are made in the model.
1. The service area is divided into hexagonal cells of the equal size.
2. A mobile user moves independently to one of neighboring cells with the uniform distribution.
3. The dwell time in any cell for a mobile user is an exponentially distributed
random variable with the average value, Td .
4. The update cost between a cell and a neighboring cell is 1.
The notations used in the proposed model are depicted in Table 1.

In Figure 2, the LA consists of 19 cells. The boundary LAs of the SLA are classified into 6 vertex LAs and 12 side LAs. A mobile user may cross the border (a
boundary cell) with probability of 1/6, 2/6, or 3/6 according to the location of the cell.

The location update of the VLR occurs when a mobile user crosses the boundary
cells of LA. Thus the total update rate of the VLR is obtained by Equation (2) which
is derived from Equation (1) in [7], as shown in Figure 2-(a).

When a mobile user moves into another SLA, the location update of the HLR happens in the boundary cells in the current SLA. Consequently, the total update rate of
the HLR is obtained by Equation (4) using Equation (3) considering the vertex LAs
and the side LAs, as shown in Figure 2-(b).

If a VLR is located at the center of an SLA, the update delay of the VLR can be regarded as the distance between the center of an SLA and the boundary cell of the SLA
where the update of the VLR happens. In Figure 3, the shadowed parts, where the
update of VLR occurs, are the boundary cells of LAs. The SLA forms three rings
which connect the center of each LA. The rings are depicted as Ring1, Ring2, and
Ring3 in the figure. Then, the average update delay of the VLR is the average distance between the center of the SLA and the corresponding ring.
The average distance is obtained by calculating the radius of a circle. The distance,
l LA is obtained by Equation (5) because ABC is a regular triangle, where ACB =

is obtained by Equation (7).

Assume that HLR is centrally located in the network because the HLR is logically
only one in the whole network.
In Figure 4, ABC is a regular triangle and ACB is 60o. AC and CD are obtained by Equation (8) and (9), respectively. Consequently, the distance between
SLA1 and SLA2, l SLA , is obtained by Equation (10).

Outer cells in the network cannot complete the ring for the SLA configuration. The
largest size of a complete ring is the greatest positive number not larger than dH. The

a regular triangle and ATI is 60o. AT and IT are obtained in Equation (13) and

4 The Results of Performance Evaluation
This section shows the results of performance evaluation in terms of the total location
update cost calculated using the model developed in the previous section.
Figure 5-(a) shows the total update cost according to the dwelling time while
Figure 5-(b) does according to the size of an LA. The optimal size of an SLA is 7
irrespective of dwelling time as shown in Figure 5-(a). Figure 5-(b) shows that the
larger the LA size is, the smaller the optimal size of an SLA become. The optimal size
of an SLA is 14, 7, and 5 when the LA size=1, 3, and, 5, respectively.

Figure 6-(a) shows that the larger the number of the total mobile users is, the larger
the optimal size of an SLA is. The optimal size of an SLA is 6, 7, and 8 when KMS =
10, 20, and 40 billion, respectively. Figure 6-(b) shows a change of the total update
cost according to the total mobile users in the same number of cells (KMS
/ K =200,000) in the network. The optimal size is constantly 7 in all cases.

5 Conclusion
The paper proposed an analytical model to obtain the optimal size of the SLA in cellular networks, considering the update rates of the HLR and that of the VLR as well
as the update delays for them. The result obtained from the model shows that the
number of cells in the whole cellular network affects sensitively the optimal size of
SLA. Also, the model provides the threshold values as a guideline when network
administrators aim to design the optimal hierarchical structure for cellular networks.
