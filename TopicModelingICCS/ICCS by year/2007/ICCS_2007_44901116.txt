Abstract. Gabor Wavelet Networks (GWN) is a method for face recognition. Evolutionary Algorithms are proved to be eﬃcient to deal with
GWN optimization problems. Inver-over Evolutionary Algorithm
(IOEA) mixed with GWN performs well in face recognition because of its
considerable eﬀects on complex functions optimizations, which is called
IOEA-GWN put forward by us, and shows higher recognition rate than
Simple Genetic Algorithm mixed with GWN (called SGA-GWN) in the
same experiment conditions according to our practices.
Keywords: Face Recognition, Evolutionary Algorithm, Wavelet

Introduction

GWN for face recognition [1], [2], [3], [4]: Gabor wavelets functions and relative weight coeﬃcients (multi-parameters) can be used to describe 2-Dimension
faces. But optimizations of objective functions and relative parameters have a
direct impact on the results of face recognition. However, in real-world applications of face recognition, it is impossible that eﬃcient selections of initial values
can be insured constantly considering robustness. Methods insensitive to initial
values should be used to improve the eﬀects of face images reconstruction and
recognition.
Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) [3] is sensitive to initial values and
relative results are easy to be made an impacted on by variant initial values
[5]; SGA which is used to optimize GWN [5] (called SGA-GWN) can reduce
the susceptibility to initial values. However, the results of SGA-GWN show slow
convergence and easy to converge into local extreme values [5]. Inver-over Evolutionary Algorithm (IOEA) has considerable eﬀects on functions and parameters
optimizations [6], [7], [8], [9]. We respectively use IOEA and SGA to optimize
GWN in the experiments.

Fig. 1. Examples in Yale face database

Yale face database can be described here: 165 images (all are grayscale images), 15 subjects, 128 × 128 (image resolution), normal faces, diﬀerent expressions, few covers, variant illuminant directions. One image of each subject is
called sample-image (I) and the rest are called test-images (I ).

Face Images Pre-processing

Face images pre-processing including lightness normalization is useful for following face recognition [10], [11].
We derive the whole expression of lightness normalization as follows during
the pre-processing.
Gray value f (x, y) ∈ [0, 255]. We assume that the image-height is h, the
image-width is w, and the default average lightness value v¯ is 128.
Average lightness value v =

Gabor Wavelets Optimizations

GWN is expressed by Gabor wavelets functions and relative weight coeﬃcients.
Gabor wavelets functions and multi-parameters optimizations’ purpose is to describe face sample images and test images, and to search the eﬀective reconˆ of image I. As to same subjects’ diﬀerent images, Gabor wavelets
struction (I)
functions are close in values but relative weight coeﬃcients are diﬀerent. According to our experience, the number of Gabor wavelets funtions is selected 52 in
each objective function (i=1,2,3,4,...,52):

Super Gabor Wavelets Optimizations

Super Gabor wavelets are the results of Gabor wavelets translation, scaling,
and rotation. The Super Gabor wavelets optimizations’ purpose is to transform
sample images to align with test images.

Gabor Wavelets Parameters Expressed in IOEA

T denotes transposition of a vector or a matrix.
Gi = (cxi , cyi , θi , sxi , syi )T ∈ Rn ,

cxi , cyi , θi , sxi , syi ∈ D.

According to our experience, the range of parameters is:
D = Gi − 64 ≤ cxi , cyi ≤ 63, 0 ≤ θi ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ sxi , syi ≤ 10
M points in D are: Gj = (xj1 , xj2 , . . . , xjm )T , j = 1, 2, . . . , m.
They span a subspace S:

Contrasts of Various GWNs

We compare test-images’ GWN with Super-GWN derived from results of Super Gabor wavelets optimizations. Various GWNs show distinctions between
diﬀerent subjects and same subjects under diﬀerent conditions (illumination,
expression, etc.). GWNs contrasts index are:
1) Euclidean distances [5] (V and W are weight coeﬃcients vectors):
d2ψ (I, I ) = Iˆ − Iˆ

2

= (V − W )T ψi , ψj (V − W )

2) Cross-correlation factors [5]:
dcψ (I, I ) =

VT

V T ψi , ψj W
ψi , ψj V W T ψi , ψj W

Various GWNs tend to be more close when dcψ (I, I ) → 1 .

Algorithms and Experiments

We especially use IOEA to optimize GWN as follows (IOEA-GWN).
{ begin
1 Initialize Population P = (G1 , G2 , . . . , G52 )T , Gi ∈ D;
2 t := 0;
3 Gbest = arg min (g(Gi )); (“arg” denotes relative parameters G when Gabor
1≤i≤52

wavelets functions converge into overall optimum);
4 Gworst = arg max (g(Gi ));
1≤i≤52

While (|g (Gbest ) − g (Gworst ) | > ε) do
{Select M points G1 , G2 , . . . , Gm randomly from P to span subspace S;
Select one point Gcrossover randomly from S;
If (g (Gcrossover ) < g (Gworst )) then Gworst = Gcrossover ;
t := t + 1;
Gbest = arg min (g(Gi ));
1≤i≤52

11 Gworst = arg max (g(Gi ));
1≤i≤52

12 end do}
13 output t, P;
14 end }
We use IOEA-GWN and SGA-GWN respectively with 5 × 52 parameters by
real number programming. Experiment Machine: CPU Celeron 1.7G, Memory
512M. Programming tool are both Matlab 6.5. Popular sizes are both 100 [12].
The Maximum numbers of generations are both 100. Selections are both roulette
wheel selection.
1) In IOEA-GWN: According to our experience, the value of M is 10 and Multiparent’s crossover-probability is 0.6.
2) In SGA-GWN: Crossover-probability is 0.6. In our experiments, “multi-point
crossover” destroys correct solutions, and “one-point crossover” shows low diversity of solutions. Therefore we use “two-point crossover” ﬁnally. Mutationprobability is 0.01.

optimizations

We select 55 images (including: 5 subjects and 11 images per subject) from
Yale face database. Then we determine a sample image per subject and other
50 images (named test-images) for recognition.
The recognition rate of SGA-GWN is not same as the high rate 97.8% [5]
because of diﬀerent numbers of test-images and databases.

Conclusion and Future Work

Following methods can be used to improve convergent rate and continuous recognition rate.
1) Improved IOEA can be used to optimize GWN.
2) Gene Expression Programming (GEP) can be used to optimize GWN (called
GEP-GWN). Because GEP has some features of dealing with high dimension parameters optimizations problems, and GEP can also be used for face
modeling.
3) All these methods can be used in 2D/3D face recognition [13] and may be
more useful for face tracking.
Therefore, the new branch “Evolvable Face Recognition, or Evolutionary Face
Recognition” is considerable to research including “Evolutionary face modeling”,
“Evolutionary face algorithms”, “Evolutionary automatic face programming”,
and “Evolutionary face hardware”. All of these are considerable to be used to
build “Evolvable Face Systems”.
