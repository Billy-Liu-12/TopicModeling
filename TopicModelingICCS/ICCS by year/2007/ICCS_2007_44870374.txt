Abstract. Generating traffic time series (traffic for short) is important in networking, e.g., simulating the Internet. In this aspect, it is desired to generate a
time series according to a given correlation structure that may well reflect the
statistics of real traffic. Recent research of traffic modeling exhibits that traffic is
well modeled by a type of Gaussian process called the generalized Cauchy (GC)
process indexed by two parameters that separately characterize the self-similarity
(SS), which is local property described by fractal dimension D, and long-range
dependence (LRD), which is a global feature that can be measured by the Hurst
parameter H, instead of using the linear relationship D = 2 − H as that used in
traditional traffic model with a single parameter such as fractional Gaussian
noise (FGN). This paper presents a computational method to generate series
based on the correlation form of GC process indexed by 2 parameters. Hence, the
present model can be used to simulate realizations that flexibly capture the fractal phenomena of real traffic for both short-term lags and long-term lags.
Keywords: Random data generation, network traffic, self-similarity, long-range
dependence, generalized Cauchy process.

1 Introduction
Network traffic is a type of fractal series with both (local) self-similarity (SS) and
long-range dependence (LRD). Hence, it is a common case to exhibit fractal phenomena of time series, see e.g. [1], [2] and references therein. Its simulation is greatly
desired in the Internet communications [3]. Conventional method to generate random
series is either based on a given probability density function, see e.g. [4], or a given
power spectrum, see e.g. [5]. For traffic simulation, however, it is expected to accurately synthesize data series according to a predetermined correlation structure [3].
This is because not only the autocorrelation function (ACF) of traffic with LRD is an
ordinary function while the power spectrum of a series with LRD is a generalized
function but also ACF of arrival traffic greatly impacts the performances of queuing

systems [6]. In addition, performance analysis desires to accurately know how one
packet arriving at time t statistically correlates to the other arriving at t + τ apart in
future as remarked in [3, First sentence, Subparagraph 4, Paragraph 2, Section 6.1].
Therefore, this paper focuses on correlation based computational method.
As known, the statistics of synthesized traffic relies on traffic correlation model
used in simulation. FGN with a single parameter is a widely used traditional traffic
model, see e.g. [7], [8], [9]. Hence, traditional methods to synthesize traffic are based
on FGN with a single parameter, see e.g. [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The realizations
based on those methods, therefore, only have the statistical properties of FGN with a
single parameter, which characterizes SS and LRD by the linear relationship
D = 2 − H . Recall that SS and LRD are two different concepts, see e.g. [15], [16],
[17], [18]. In fact , let X (t ) be traffic series. Then, X (t ) being of SS with SS index
κ means

X (at )  aκ X (t ) , a > 0,

(1)

where  denotes equality in finite joint finite distribution. On the other hand, X (t ) is
of LRD if its ACF, r (τ ), is non-summable. That is, r (τ ) follows power law given by
r (τ ) ~ cτ − β (τ → ∞ ), c > 0, 0<β <1.

(2)

In principle, D and H can be measured independently [15-18]. The former can
be used to characterize SS while the later LRD. In the case of FGN introduced by
[19], however, they are linearly related. ACF of FGN in the discrete case is given by

[1], [31]. The case 0.5 < H < 1 corresponds to LRD,
π H (2 H − 1)
0 < H < 0.5 implies short-range dependence (SRD). FGN reduces to standard white
noise when H = 0.5 . FGN with a single parameter characterizes both SS and LRD of
traffic by H, or equivalently D.
The limitation of single-parameter FGN in traffic modeling has been noticed as can
be seen from the discussions in [9, Last sentence, Paragraph 4, §7.4], which stated
that “it might be difficult to characterize the correlations over the entire traffic traces
with a single Hurst parameter”. As a matter of fact, [20] mentioned the shortcoming
that the single parameter model, e.g., FGN, does not well fit series for short-term lags.
Recently, [16] introduced a class of stationary Gaussian processes indexed by two
parameters, which separately characterizes SS and LRD of fractal time series. That
model is in the Cauchy class since it can be regarded as extension of the generalized
Cauchy (GC) process used in geostatistics [21]. In this regard, our recent papers [17],
[18], [22] provided theoretical analysis with demonstrations and comparisons using
real-traffic series to show that 2-parameter model is far agreement with real traffic in
comparison with single parameter model such as FGN. In addition, our early work
[14] gave a correlation-based method for the generation of LRD series with single
parameter. Nevertheless, reports regarding the simulation of time series obeying the

GC model are rarely seen, to our best knowledge, letting along the simulation of traffic series. In this paper, we substantially extend our previous work [14] based on GC
process model [17] to synthesize traffic series with 2 parameters so that the synthesized series has the property that SS and LRD are decoupled.
The remaining article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefs the concept of GC
processes. Section 3 gives the computational model of traffic generation based on the
Cauchy correlation model. Section 4 illustrates the demonstrations. Finally, Section 5
concludes the paper.

2 Concept of GC Process
X (t ) is called a GC process if it is a stationary Gaussian centred process with the
following ACF:

r (τ ) = E [ X (t + τ ) X (t ) ] = (1 + τ α ) − β / α ,τ > 0,

(4)

where 0 < α ≤ 2, and β > 0, [16], [17], [18].
Note that r (τ ) is positive-definite for the above ranges of α and β , and it is a
completely monotone for 0 < α ≤ 1, β > 0. When α = 2 and β = 1, one gets the
usual Cauchy process.
Clearly the GC process satisfies the LRD property for β < 1 since

(

∫ r (τ )dτ = ∫ 1 + τ

)

α −β /α

dτ = ∞ if β < 1.

(5)

We note that the GC process is locally self-similar as can be seen from the following. As a matter of fact, it is a Gaussian stationary process and it is locally self-similar
of order α since its ACF satisfies for τ → 0,
r (τ ) = 1 −

(6)

The above expression is equivalent to the following more commonly used definition of locally self-similarity of a Gaussian process.
X (t ) − X (aτ )  aκ [ X (t ) − X (τ )] , τ → 0.

(7)

The equivalence can be shown by noting that for τ 1 and τ 2 → 0, (6) gives for

κ =α /2
E [ ( X (t + bτ 1 ) − X (t ))( X (t + bτ 2 ) − X (t )) ] =

α
In order to determine the fractal dimension of the graph of X (t ), we consider the
local property of traffic. The fractal dimension D of a locally self-similar traffic of
order α is given by (see [17], [18], [23]).

From (2), therefore, one has

From (8) and (9), we see that D and H may vary independently. X (t ) is of LRD
for β ∈ (0, 1) and SRD for β > 1. Thus, we have the fractal index α which determines the fractal dimension, and the index β that characterizes the LRD. In the end
of this section, we discuss estimates of D and H of a GC process for the purpose of
completing the description of GC processes though the focus of this paper does not
relate to their estimators.
There are some techniques that are popularly used to estimate D, such as boxcounting, spectral, and variogram-based methods, see e.g. [15], [24], [25]. Nevertheless, some of the more popular methods, e.g., box-counting, suffer from biases [26].
The method worth noting is called the variogram estimator that was explained in [27].
Denote γ (d ) the observed mean of the square of the difference between two values of
the series at points that are distance d apart. Then, this estimator has the scaling law
given by
log γ (d ) = constant + α log d + error for d → 0.

(10)

The above scaling law is suitable for stationary processes satisfying 1 − r (τ ) ~ τ

−α

for τ → 0. The variogram estimator of D is expressed by Dˆ = 2 − αˆ / 2, where αˆ is
the slope in a log-log plot of γ ( d ) versus d .
The reported estimators of H are rich, such as R / S analysis, maximum likelihood method, and so forth [2], [15], [28]. The method worth mentioning is called the
detrended fluctuation analysis introduced in [29], [30]. With this technique, a series is
partitioned into blocks of size m. Within each block, least-square fitting is used.
Denote v(m) the average of the sample variances. Then, the detrended fluctuation
analysis is based on the following scaling law.
log v(m) = constant + (2 − β ) log m + error for m → ∞.

(11)

The above is applicable for stationary processes satisfying (2), see [28] for details.
The estimate Hˆ of H is half the slope in a log-log plot of v( m) versus m.

3 Computational Model
Let w(t ), W (ω ) and Sw (ω ) be a white noise function, its spectrum and the power
spectrum, respectively. Then, W(ω ) = F [ w(t )] and Sw (ω ) = WW = Constant, where W is

378

the complex conjugation of W and F is the operator of Fourier transform. Suppose
w(t ) is the unit white noise. Then, Sw (ω ) = 1.
Let h(t ) and H (ω ) respectively be the impulse function and system function of a
linear filter, which we call simulator in this paper. Denote y (t ) the response under
the excitation of w(t ). Then, y = w ∗ h, where ∗ means the operation of convolution.
Denote S y (ω ) the power spectrum of y. Then, under the excitation of w, one has
S y (ω ) = H (ω ) . Let y be the GC process X . Then, H (ω ) = S X (ω ).

Denote ψ (ω ) the phase function of H (ω ). Then, H (ω ) = S X (ω )e − jψ (ω ) , where

⎤.
⎦⎥

Without losing the generality, let ψ (ω ) = 2nπ (n = 0, 1,"). Therefore, the impulse
function of the simulator to generate traffic following GC processes under the excitation of white noise is

where F −1 is the inverse of F. Consequently, the output of simulator, i.e., the synthesized traffic obeying GC processes is given by

In the above, w(t ) = F −1[W (ω )], where W (ω ) = e jϑ (ω ) , where θ is a real random
function with arbitrary distribution. In practice, traffic is band-limited. Thus, let

where φ (ω ) is a real random function with arbitrary distribution and cutoff frequency
ωc is such that it completely covers the band of the traffic of interest.
In the discrete case, w(n) = IFFT[W (ω )], where IFFT represents the inverse of
FFT (fast Fourier transform). Fig. 1 indicates the computation procedure.

4 Case Study
Simulated realizations are shown in Figs. 2-3. Due to the advantage of the separated
characterizations of D and H by using the Cauchy correlation model, we can observe
the distinct effects of D and H . In Fig. 2, the Hurst parameter H is constant 0.75 but
the fractal dimension D decreases, (D = 1.95 and 1.20). Comparing Fig. 2 (a) and (b),
we can see the realization in Fig. 2 (a) is rough while that in Fig. 2 (b) smooth.
In Fig. 3, fractal dimension D is constant 1 while H decreases (H = 0.95 and
0.55). From Fig. 3, we can evidently see the stronger persistence (i.e., stronger LRD)
in (a) than that in (b).

5 Conclusions
We have given a computational model to generate traffic with separate parametrization of the self-similarity property and long-range dependence based on the correlation model of the generalized Cauchy processes. Since this correlation model can
separately characterize the fractal dimension and the Hurst parameter of a process, the
present method can be used to simulate realizations that have the same long-range
dependence with different fractal dimensions (i.e., different burstinesses from the
view point of networking). On the other hand, we can synthesize realizations that
have the same fractal dimension but with different long-range dependencies. Hence it
provides a flexible way to simulate realizations of traffic. These are key advantages of
the computational model presented.
