Abstract. As a versatile investment tool in energy markets for speculators and
hedgers, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) futures are quite well
known. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid model incorporating ARCH
family models and ANN model to forecast GSCI futures price. Empirical
results show that the hybrid ARCH(1)-M-ANN model is superior to ARIMA,
ARCH(1) GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1) and ARIMA-ANN models on the
RMSE, MAPE, Theil IC evaluation criteria.

1 Introduction
Commodity index futures are a versatile tool for taking different forms of exposure to
energy commodity markets. They provide investors with an instrument for taking
leveraged exposure [1]. There are three famous commodity indices in energy markets
which can serve as a surrogate for direct investment: Commodity Research Bureau
(CRB) Index, Dow Jones-AIG (DJ-AIG) Commodity Index and Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index (GSCI).
CRB index, which began trading on the New York Futures Exchange in 1986, is
the oldest. DJ-AIG commodity index, which started in 1999, is rebalanced annually. It
reduces return by about 1.5%, compared to monthly rebalancing [2]. GSCI, which
started in July 1992 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, is a broad-based and
production-weighted commodity index. Its volumes have generally exceeded those of
CRB index. Lummer and Siegel (1993), who explored GSCI collateralized futures as
an asset found that a collateralized position in GSCI futures is a good diversification
for stocks and bonds. Paul D.Kaplan and Scott L.Lummer (1997) showed that GSCI
collateralized futures were especially valuable to investors who seek diversification
and protection against poor returns in other asset classes.
Therefore, we make a research effort covering the GSCI futures, especially the
futures price forecasting. In the forecasting field, many researchers have created many
successful models, such as ARIMA, ARCH etc... Recently, more hybrid forecasting

models have been developed that integrate time series model with artificial neural
network model to improve prediction accuracy. Lean Yu and Shouyang Wang (2005)
obtained a novel nonlinear ensemble forecasting model incorporating GLAR and
ANN for foreign exchange rates. G.Peter Zhang (2003) also designed a time series
forecasting model using a hybrid ARIMA and a neural networks model. In his paper,
he argued that a hybrid methodology can take advantage of the unique strength of
ARIMA and ANN models in linear and nonlinear modeling. So this paper proposes a
hybrid model incorporating ARCH and ANN model to forecast GSCI futures price.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a
description of the GSCI. The hybrid model is introduced in detail in Section 3. A
preliminary analysis and empirical results from the GSCI futures price data sets are
reported in Section 4. Conclusions are obtained in Section 5.

2 Description of the GSCI
The GSCI is a world production-weighted commodity index comprising of liquid,
exchange-traded futures contracts on energy products. It is designed to provide
investors with a reliable benchmark for investment performance in energy commodity
markets in a manner comparable to the S&P 500 Index for the stock markets.
The GSCI is world-production weighted; the quantity of each commodity in the
index is determined by the average production in the last five years of available data.
Such weighting provides the GSCI with significant advantages, both as an economic
indicator and as a measure of investment performance. Currently, the GSCI contains
24 commodities from different commodity sectors: six energy products, five industrial
metals, eight agricultural products, three livestock products and two precious metals.
Table 1 displays a list of the 24 commodities with their dollar weights in the GSCI.

The GSCI futures are listed for all 12 calendar months. The contract value of each
GSCI futures position is $250 times the GSCI index. The minimum price fluctuation
is 0.05 index points, equivalent to a value of $12.5 per point. The last trading day of
the GSCI futures is the eleventh business day of the contract month, and the position
limits is 10,000 net long or short in all contract months combined. The final
settlement price shall be the closing price of the GSCI futures price index on the
eleventh business day of the contract month.

3 A Hybrid ARCH-M and BP Neural Network Model
3.1 ARCH Family Models
Following the introduction of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)
model by Engle (1982), there are many extensions of ARCH model, such as GARCH,
GARCH-M, EGACH etc.; we can call them ARCH family models. ARCH model can
be expressed as follows
y t =x t ′ β + ε t

(1)

ε t = ht ⋅ vt

(2)

ht = α 0 + α1ε t −1 + " + α q ε t − q
2

Where

2

(3)

∑

vt i.i.d. , E (vt ) = 0, D(vt ) = 1 α 0 > 0, α i ≥ 0

q
i =1

αi < 1

This model is also known as the linear ARCH(q) model. With financial data it
captures the information from ε t . Bollerslev(1986) proposed an alternative model, the
GARCH(p,q) model. In his model, ht was expressed as following:
ht = α 0 + α1ε t −1 + " + α q ε t − q + θ 1 ht −1 + " + θ p ht − p
2

Where

2

∑

vt i.i.d. , E (vt ) = 0, D(vt ) = 1 α 0 > 0, α i ≥ 0

q

(4)

α i + ∑ j =1 θ j < 1
p

i =1

The ARCH-M model was introduced by Engle, Lilien, and Robins(1987). Since
many theories in finance involve an explicit tradeoff between the risk and the
expected return, this model is ideally suited to handling such questions in a time series
context where the conditional variance may be time-varying. The model is given by
y t =x t ′ β + γ h t + ε t

(5)

ht = α 0 + α 1ε t −1 + " + α q ε t − q
2

Where

2

vt i.i.d. , E (vt ) = 0, D(vt ) = 1 α 0 > 0, α i ≥ 0

(6)

∑

q
i =1

αi < 1

Certainly, the ARCH-M model can also become the GARCH-M model if h t fulfill
the equation:
ht = α 0 +

∑

q
i =1

α iε t −i + ∑ j =1 θ j ht − j
p

2

(7)

People found the applications of the GARCH model limited since the conditional
variance is only linked to past conditional variances. Then the EGARCH model was
developed by Nelson (1991). In this class of ARCH models, the volatility depended
not only on the magnitude of the past surprises in returns but also on their
corresponding signs. EGARCH model is given as follows
p

ln(ht ) = α 0 +

∑

q

θ j ln(ht − j ) +

∑ α g (v
i

t −i )

(8)

i =1

g (vt ) = ϕi vt +

(9)

To sum up, we can find that the ARCH family models focus on building the
different models to dispose the variance ε t in order to obtain more information from
the time series data.
3.2 BP Neural Network Model

A neural network model takes an input vector X and produces output vector Y. The
relationship between X and Y is determined by the network architecture. The neural
network generally consists of at least three layers: one input layer, one output layer,
and one or more hidden layers. It is widely accepted that a three-layer back
propagation neural network with an identity transfer function in the output unit and
logistic functions in the middle-layer units can approximate well any continuous
function arbitrarily, given a sufficient amount of middle-layer units [3].
As Tam and Kiang (1992) reported, the back-propagation algorithm consists of two
phases. Suppose we have s samples. Each is described by
xi = ( xi1 , xi 2 , " , xim )

(10)

Ti = (ti1 , ti 2 , " , tin )

(11)

Where Xi is an input vector, Ti is a target output vector and 1 ≤ i ≤ s.
In the first phase (forward-propagation), Xi is fed into the input layer, and an output
Yi = (yi1, yi2, …, yin) is generated based on the current weight vector W. The objective
is to minimize an error function E, which is defined as
s

E=

(12)

In the second phase (back-propagation), a gradient descent in the weight space, W,
is performed to locate the optimal solution. The direction and magnitude change Δwij
can be computed as
Δ wij = −

Where 0 <

ε

∂E

(13)

< 1 is a parameter controlling the algorithm’s convergence rate.

3.3 A Hybrid Model

Since it is difficult to completely know the characteristics of the data in a real
problem, hybrid methodology that has both linear and nonlinear capabilities can be a
good strategy for practical use. According to the theory of ARCH model, we have the
LM to test the GSCI data, and we find that the GSCI data have the ARCH effects.
Therefore, we propose a hybrid model incorporating ARCH model and ANN model.
Considering a time series to be composed of a linear relation structure and a
nonlinear component [4], the hybrid model is
ˆ = Lˆ + Nˆ
Y
t
t
t

(14)

Where Lˆt and Nˆ t denote the linear and nonlinear components.
We first process the ARCH family model for the linear component, and then we
obtain the residuals. The residual at time t is

et = yt − Lˆt

(15)

With the ANN model, the residual forecast value Nˆ t will be

Nˆ t = f ( e t − 1 , e t − 2 ，… … e t − n ) + ξ t

(16)

Where f (⋅) is a nonlinear function and ξ t is the random error.
Thus, the combined forecast will be

ˆ = Lˆ + Nˆ
Y

(17)

3.4 Forecast Evaluation Criteria

Three criteria will be used to evaluate the model forecasting ability. The first is the
root mean squared error (RMSE). The formula for RMSE is
RMSE=

∑ ( yˆ

t

− yt )

2

n

Where yˆ t is the predicted value, y t is the actual value.

(18)

The second is the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). It is a measure of average
error in percentage terms for each point forecast. MAPE is given by
MAPE=

1

∑
n

yˆ t − y t
yt

× 100

(19)

The third is the Theil Inequality Coefficient (Theil IC). Theil IC value is always
between 0 and 1, and a smaller value indicates the error between the predicted value
and the actual value is smaller. Theil IC is given by

∑ ( yˆ
Theil IC =

Laboratory Corporation. The main equation is regression equation and Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC) rule is used to determine the lag lengths. Finally, we
select 3 lags after testing many times. The residual equation we selected are ARCH
(1), GARCH (1,1), ARCH (1)-M, GARCH (1,1)-M, EGARCH(1,1) for Bollerslev’s
(1988) idea, in most applications p=q=1 is found to suffice. On the other hand, the
ANN model uses trial and error to determine the network architecture of 4-4-1 by
minimizing the forecasting error [5].
First, we process the forecast using the ARCH family models. Table 2 gives the
forecasting result. According to the forecast evaluating criteria, we can find that the
ARCH(1)-M performs best.
