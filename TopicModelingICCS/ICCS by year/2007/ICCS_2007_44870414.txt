Abstract. This paper presents a brief overview of the work on translation of Common Information Model (CIM) to Web Ontology Language
(OWL) standard. The main motivation for the work is given, along with
discussion of major issues faced during this work. The paper contains
also comparison of existing approaches to conversion of CIM to OWL
and presents the CIM2OWL tool that performs the conversion of CIM
schema and allows convertion of CIM instances - representing for instance
conﬁgurations of particular systems - to OWL individuals.
Key words: Metadata, ontologies, Grid computing, Common Information Model, ontology translation.

Introduction

Several researchers have risen lately the issue of translation of existing and widely
recognized Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) standard for resource
description called Common Information Model (CIM) [1] to Web Ontology Language (OWL) [2]. Especially in the Grid setting, where OWL could be used for
representation of semantic Grid metadata, the problem of the interoperability
appears. Among reference ontologies for modeling the hardware and software
computer resources the DMTF Common Information Model as well known, organizationally supported and regularly updated meta-model for the considered
area (e.g. popularly referred in software for management of systems, networks,
users and applications across multiple vendor environments) seemed promising.
CIM is a hybrid approach, inspired by the object oriented modeling and database information modeling. The CIM Schema consists in particular of Core and
Common Models as well as developed by users Extension Schemas. As it introduces the metadata for annotating model classes and instances, it is partially
not compliant with the UML methodology. OWL is W3C recommended ontology
language for the Semantic Web, which exploits many of the strengths of Description Logics, including well deﬁned semantics and practical reasoning techniques.
OWL oﬀers greater expressiveness of information content description then that
supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema, by providing additional vocabulary
along with some formal semantics.

CIM to OWL Mapping

In the beginning, the mapping between semantically equivalent constructs in
MOF and OWL was established. That included class deﬁnition, inheritance (to
some extent), data type attributes, cardinality constraints, comments, etc. The
succeeding step in deﬁnition of the mapping was to extend the existing mapping
with representations of MOF constructs, which do not have direct equivalents
in OWL.

The lack of fully equivalent constructions or rules for expressing some MOF
constructs in OWL implied that partial, simpliﬁed mappings had to be admitted. These unambiguous mappings concerned mainly data restrictions (e.g.
qualiﬁer Value, ValueMaps), distinctions (e.g. qualiﬁer Key, Propagated, Weak),
redeﬁnitions (e.g. qualiﬁer Override), access (e.g. qualiﬁer Read, Write), versioning (qualiﬁer Version), default values, abstracting (qualiﬁer Abstract), and
dynamics (e.g. procedures, qualiﬁer IN, OUT). Unfortunately, many issues of

the not fully semantically equivalent part schema mapping are out of the scope
of this paper. To achieve optimal mappings a few approaches were used such
as usage of various semantic constructs with an approximate and uncontradictory meaning (e.g. for qualiﬁer Override), deﬁnition of an additional meta
ontology for a provision of missing CIM vocabulary called cim-meta (e.g. for
qualiﬁers Abstract, ValueMap, Values, default values) and usage of annotation
properties and comments (e.g. for qualiﬁer Units). An excerpt from mapping is
given in Table 1 (see http://gom.kwfgrid.net for details). The resulting OWL
ontology has OWL DL expressiveness except for Key qualiﬁer which requires
InverseFunctionalProperty to be applied to datatype values, which is not allowed in OWL DL. Thus using our tool, the user can choose to create OWL Full
ontology with the Key qualiﬁer, or stay in OWL DL dialect without the Key
property. The instance mapping is provided based on the schema mapping. An
occurrence of various qualiﬁers in class deﬁnitions usually does not inﬂuence the
conversion of MOF instances to OWL and deﬁnition of new instances based on
the OWL ontology.

Related Work

In K-Wf Grid project, a set of ontologies describing generic and domain speciﬁc
aspects of the Grid were gathered and integrated for the thematic areas of workﬂows, Grid applications, services, data and resources [3]. Ontologies stored and
managed by the component called Grid Organizational Memory (GOM) [4] are
optimized for use in the Grid applications [5]. The authors of [6] propose to use
XML-based ontology language to deﬁne resource management information for
network management systems. In [7], authors present a generic and extensible
ontology for describing several aspects of Grid environment. In [8] an idea of
developing semantic descriptions of the web services based on the CIM speciﬁcations is presented. In [9] the mapping of CIM UML notation to RDF-S, and
the extension to OWL, are presented. The author of [10] focuses on the troublesome CIM to OWL translation issues. Currently one translation tool is available
called CIMTool [11]. Several generic knowledge representation translators also
exist such as those described in [12] or [13].

Conclusions

As a result of our work we have created the mapping schema from CIM to
OWL, the OWL resource ontology based on CIM and the CIM2OWL tool, whose
advantage is the ability to translate not only CIM schema (i.e. CIM Core and
Common Models) but also CIM instances. The large scope of the expressiveness
and functionality was transformed from CIM to OWL.
