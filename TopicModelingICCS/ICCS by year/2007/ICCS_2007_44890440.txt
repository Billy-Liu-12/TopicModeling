Introduction

We shall assume familiarity with graph theory and matroid theory. For terms
that are not deﬁned in this note, see [2] for graphs, and [8] for matroids. Let C
be the family of circuits of a matroid M . It satisﬁes the following two axioms:
(C1) A proper subset of a member of C is not a member of C .
(C2) If a ∈ C1 ∩ C2 and b ∈ C1 − C2 where C1 , C2 ∈ C and a, b ∈ E, then
there exists a C3 ∈ C such that b ∈ C3 ⊆ (C1 ∪ C2 ) − {a}.
Now we give a new concept as follows. The circuit graph of a matroid M is a
graph G = G(M ) with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G) such that V (G) = C
and E(G) = {CC | C, C ∈ C , | C ∩ C |= 0} , where the same notation is used
for the vertices of G and the circuits of M .
Maurer discussed the relationship of bases of matroids and graphs and deﬁned
the base graph of a matroid [6, 7]. Liu studied the connectivities of base graph
of matroids [3, 4]. Other related results can be found in [1, 5]. In this paper we
study the edge connectivity in the circuit graphs of matroids.
In this paper we will prove that the edge connectivity of the circuit graph of
any connected matroid is equal to its minimum degree δ(G).

Preliminary Results

Lemma 1 [8]. A matroid M is connected if and only if for every pair e1 , e2 of
distinct elements of E , there is a circuit containing both e1 and e2 .
Lemma 2 [8]. If M is a connected matroid, then for every e ∈ E, either M/e
or M \e is also connected.

Lemma 3 [8]. Let C and C be any circuit and co-circuit of a matroid M .
Then | C ∩ C |= 1.
Lemma 4 [8]. If M is a matroid and if X and Y are two disjoint sets of
elements of M , then (M \X)/Y = (M/Y )\X.

Main Results

A matroid M is trivial if it has no circuits. In the following all matroids will be
nontrivial.
Next we will discuss the properties of the matroid circuit graph. To prove the
main results we ﬁrstly present the following lemmas which are clearly true.
Lemma 5. Let M be any nontrivial matroid on E and e ∈ E. If G and G1 are
circuit graphs of M and M \e , respectively, then G1 is a subgraph of G induced
by V1 = V (G) − V2 where V2 = {C | C ∈ C , e ∈ C}.
Obviously the subgraph G2 of G induced by V2 is a complete graph. By Lemma
5, G1 and G2 are induced subgraphs of G and V (G1 ) and V (G2 ) partition V (G).
Lemma 6. For any matroid M = (E, C ) which has a 2-cocircuit {a, b}, the
circuit graph of M is isomorphic to that of M/a.
Lemma 7. Suppose that M = (E, C ) is a connected matroid with two distinct
circuits C1 , C2 such that |E − (C1 ∪ C2 )| ≥ 2 and for any e ∈ E − (C1 ∪ C2 ),
M \e is disconnected. Then M has a co-circuit of cardinality two.
Proof: We shall prove the theorem by induction on |E −(C1 ∪C2 )|. Suppose that
E − (C1 ∪ C2 ) = {e1 ∪ e2 } and M \ei (i = 1, 2) is disconnected. If C1 and C2 are
in the same component of M \e1 , and {e2 } is the other component of M \e1 , then
any circuit containing e2 contains e1 . {e1 , e2 } is a co-circuit of M because by
(C2), if there is a circuit containing e1 does not contain e2 then there is a circuit
containing e2 does not contain e1 , which is a contradiction. If C1 and C2 are not
in the same component of M \e1 and e2 is in the same component with C1 , then
M \e2 cannot be disconnected because there is a circuit containing e1 intersects
both C1 and C2 but does not contain e2 . Thus {e2 } is another component of
M \e1 . Therefore {e1 , e2 } is a co-circuit of M .
Suppose the result is true for |E − (C1 ∪ C2 )| = n − 1. We prove that the result
is also true for |E −(C1 ∪C2 )| = n > 3. Let e1 be an element of E −(C1 ∪C2 ) and
M \e1 is disconnected. Hence, by Lemma 2, M/e1 is connected. Now if e2 is any
element of E − (C1 ∪ C2 ∪ {e1 }), the matroid (M \e2 )/e1 is disconnected unless
{e1 } is a component of M \e2 . If {e1 } is a component of M \e2 , then {e1 , e2 } is a
co-circuit of M . If (M \e2 )/e1 is disconnected for each e2 ∈ E − (C1 ∪ C2 ∪ {e1 }),
by Lemma 4, (M/e1 )\e2 = (M \e2 )/e1 , we have (M/e1 )\e2 is disconnected for
all e2 ∈ E − (C1 ∪ C2 ∪ {e1 }). By induction, M/e1 has a co-circuit of cardinality
two. A co-circuit of M/e1 is also a co-circuit of M . We prove the Lemma.
Now we give the main theorem of this paper.

Theorem 1. Suppose that G = G(M ) is the circuit graph of a connected nontrivial matroid M = (E, C ) and C1 and C2 are distinct vertices of G. Then C1
and C2 are connected by d = min{d(C1 ), d(C2 )} edge-disjoint paths where d(C1 )
and d(C2 ) denote the degree of vertices C1 and C2 in G, respectively.
Proof: We shall prove the theorem by induction on |E(M )|. When |E(M )| = 3,
each element in M is parallel to another. It is easy to see that G(M ) = K3 . The
theorem is clearly true. Suppose that the result is true for |E(M )| = n − 1. We
prove that the result is also true for |E(M )| = n > 3. Let C1 and C2 be any two
vertices in G.
There are two cases to distinguish.
Case 1: (C1 ∪C2 ) = E(M ). It is easy to see that C1 and C2 are both adjacent
to any circuit in C − {C1 ∪ C2 } and the conclusion is obviously true.
Case 2: (C1 ∪ C2 ) = E(M ).
There are two subcases to distinguish.
Subcase 2.1: There is an element e ∈ E(M ) − (C1 ∪ C2 ) such that M \e is
connected. Let G1 = G(M \e) be the circuit graph of M \e and G2 be the subgraph of G induced by V2 where V2 = {C | C ∈ C , e ∈ C} . Thus C1 and C2 are
in G1 . By induction, in G1 , C1 , C2 are connected by d1 = min{d1 (C1 ), d1 (C2 )}
edge-disjoint paths where d1 (C1 ) and d1 (C2 ) denote the degree of vertices C1
and C2 in G1 , respectively. Let P1 = {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pd1 } be the family of shortest
edge-disjoint paths connecting C1 and C2 in G1 . Without loss of generality, we
may assume that d1 (C1 ) ≥ d1 (C2 ). There are two subcases to distinguish.
Subcase 2.1a: d1 (C1 ) = d1 (C2 ). The conclusion is obvious because G2 is a
complete graph.
Subcase 2.1b: d1 (C1 ) > d1 (C2 ). By induction, in G1 there are d1 =
min{d1 (C1 ), d1 (C2 )} = d1 (C2 ) edge-disjoint paths connecting C1 and C2 . Let
P1 = {P1 , P2 , . . . , Pd1 (C2 ) } be the family of shortest edge-disjoint paths connecting C1 and C2 in G1 . It is obvious that each Pi (i = 1, 2, . . . , d1 (C2 )) contains exactly one vertex adjacent to C1 and one vertex adjacent to C2 . Let
A1 , A2 , . . . , Ad1 (C1 )−d1 (C2 ) be the vertices in G1 that are adjacent to C1 but
not contained in d1 edge-disjoint paths. By Lemma 1, for any element e in
Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , d1 (C1 ) − d1 (C2 )) there is a circuit Ai in G2 containing e
and e , thus Ai Ai is an edge in G(M ). Let D1 , D2 , . . . , Dm denote the vertices in G2 that is adjacent to C2 . G2 is a complete graph, so Ai is adjacent
to Dj (i = 1, 2, . . . , d1 (C1 ) − d1 (C2 ); j = 1, 2, . . . , m). If m ≤ d1 (C1 ) − d1 (C2 ),
C1 Ai Ai Di C2 are m edge-disjoint paths connecting C1 and C2 where Ai can be Di
(i = 1, 2, . . . , m). Here it is possible that Ai = Aj (i = j; i, j = 1, 2, . . . , d1 (C1 ) −
d1 (C2 )). But it is forbidden that Di = Dj (i = j; i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m). d(C2 ) =
d1 (C2 ) + m ≤ d1 (C1 ) < d(C1 ), thus d = min{d(C1 ), d(C2 )} = d(C2 ). P = P1 ∪
{C1 A1 A1 D1 C2 , C1 A2 A2 D2 C2 , . . . , C1 Am Am Dm C2 } are d edge-disjoint paths
connecting C1 and C2 in G (see Fig.1).
If m > d1 (C1 ) − d1 (C2 ), The proof is similar to that above.

Subcase 2.2: There is no element e ∈ E(M ) − (C1 ∪ C2 ) such that M \e
is connected. If E(M ) − (C1 ∪ C2 ) = {e} and M \e is disconnected, it is easy
to see that C1 ∩ C2 = ∅ and C1 , C2 are the two components of M \e. Thus any
circuit of M intersecting both C1 and C2 contains e, then C1 and C2 are both
adjacent to any circuit in C − {C1 ∪ C2 } and the conclusion is obviously true.
Suppose that |E(M ) − (C1 ∪ C2 )| ≥ 2 and for any e ∈ E(M ) − (C1 ∪ C2 ), M \e is
disconnected. By Lemma 7, M has a 2-cocircuit {a, b}. By Lemma 6, the circuit
graph of M/a is isomorphic to that of M . By induction hypothesis, the result
holds.
Thus the theorem follows by induction.
By Theorem 1 and Menger’s Theorem, we can get the following corollary.
Corollary 2. Suppose that G = G(M ) is the circuit graph of a connected matroid M with minimum degree δ(G). Then the edge connectivity κ (G) = δ(G).
