Abstract. The paper describes the strategy for eﬃcient solving of diﬃcult inverse problems, utilizing Finite Element Method (FEM) as a direct
problem solver. The strategy consists of ﬁnding an optimal balance between the accuracy of global optimization method and the accuracy of
an hp-adaptive FEM used for the multiple solving of the direct problem.
The crucial relation among errors was found for the objective function
being the energy of the system deﬁning the direct problem. The strategy was applied for searching the thermal expansion coeﬃcient (CTE)
parameter in the Step-and-ﬂash Imprint Lithography (SFIL) process.
Keywords: Inverse problems, Finite Element Method, hp adaptivity,

Introduction

Inverse parametric problems belong to the group of heaviest computational tasks.
Their solution require a sequence of direct problem solutions, e.g. obtained by
Finite Element Method (FEM), thus the accuracy of the inverse problem solution
is limited by the accuracy of the direct problem solution. We utilize the fully
automatic hp FEM codes [6,3] generating a sequence of computational meshes
delivering exponential convergence of the numerical error with respect to the
mesh size for solving direct problems. Using the maximum accuracy for the direct
problem solve by each iteration of inverse solver leads to needles computational
costs (see e.g. [4]). A better strategy is to balance dynamically the accuracy of
both iterations.
However, to be able to execute such strategy we need to relate the error of
optimization method deﬁned as the uncorrectness of objective function value
with the FEM solution error. We propose such relation and the detailed error
balance strategy for the objective being the energy of the system that is described
by the simple problem.

The strategy is tested on the Step-and-Flash Impring Lithography (SFIL)
simulations. The objective of the inverse analysis is to ﬁnd value of the thermal
expansion coeﬃcient enforcing shrinkage of the feature well comparable with
experimental data. The energy used for the error estimation of the objective
function was obtained from the experimental data and static molecular model
calculations [5].

The Automatic hp Adaptive Finite Element Method

Sequential and parallel 3D hp adaptive FEM codes [6], [3] generate in fully automatic mode a sequence of hp FE meshes providing exponential convergence
of the numerical error with respect to size of the mesh (number of degrees of
freedom, CPU time). Given an initial mesh, called the coarse mesh, presented

Fig. 1. The coarse mesh with p = 2 and ﬁne mesh with p = 3 on all elements edges,
faces, and interiors. The optimal meshes after the ﬁrst, second and third iterations.
Various colors denote various polynomial orders of approximation.

on the ﬁrst picture in Fig. 1, with polynomial orders of approximations p = 2
on elements edges, faces and interiors, we ﬁrst perform global hp reﬁnement to
produce the ﬁne mesh presented on the second picture in Fig. 1, by breaking
each element into 8 son elements, and increasing the polynomial order of approximation by one. The direct problem is solved on the coarse and on the ﬁne
mesh. The energy norm (see e.g. [1]) diﬀerence between coarse and ﬁne mesh
solutions is then utilized to estimate relative errors over coarse mesh elements.
The optimal reﬁnements are then selected and performed for coarse mesh elements with high relative errors. The coarse mesh elements can be broken into
smaller son elements (this procedure is called h reﬁnement) or the polynomial
order of approximation can be increased on element edges, faces or interiors (this
procedure is called p reﬁnement), or both (this is called hp reﬁnement). For each
ﬁnite element from the coarse mesh we consider locally several possible h, p or hp
reﬁnements. For each ﬁnite element the reﬁnement strategy providing maximum
error decrease rate is selected. The error decrease rate
rate =

uh/2,p+1 − uhp − uh/2,p+1 − whp
.

is deﬁned as relative error estimation in energy norm divided by number of
degrees of freedom added. Here uhp stands for the coarse mesh solution, uh/2,p+1

for the ﬁne mesh solution and whp is the solution corresponding to proposed
reﬁnement strategy, obtained by the projection based interpolation technique [2].
The optimal mesh generated in such a way becomes a coarse mesh for the next
iteration, and the entire procedure is repeated as long as the global relative error
estimation is larger then the required accuracy of the solution (see [6] for more
details). The sequence of optimal meshes generated by automatic hp-adaptive
code from the coarse mesh is presented on third, fourth and ﬁfth pictures in
Figure 1. The relative error of the solution goes down from 15% to 5%.

The Relation Between the Objective Function Error
and the Finite Element Method Error

We assume the direct problem is modeled by the abstract variational equation
u ∈ u0 + V
b (u, v) = l (v) ∀v ∈ V

(2)

where u0 is the lift of the Dirichlet boundary conditions [2]. Functionals b and
l depend on the inverse problem parameters d. The variational problem (2) is
equivalent with the minimization one (3), if b is symmetric and positive deﬁnite
(see e.g. [2])
u ∈ u0 + V
(3)
E (u) = 12 b (u, u) − l (u) −→ min.
where E (u) = 12 b (u, u)−l (u) is the functional of the total energy of the solution.
The Problem (2) may be approximated using the FEM on the ﬁnite dimensional subspace Vh,p ⊂ V
uh,p ∈ u0 + Vh,p
.
b (uh,p , vh,p ) = l (vh,p ) ∀vh,p ∈ Vh,p

(4)

For a sequence of meshes generated by the self-adaptive hp FEM code, for every
coarse mesh, a coarse mesh space is a subset of the corresponding ﬁne mesh
space, Vh,p ⊂ Vh/2,p+1 ⊂ V .
An absolute relative FEM error utilized by the self-adaptive hp FEM code is
deﬁned as the energy norm diﬀerence between the coarse and ﬁne mesh solutions
errF EM = uh,p − uh/2,p+1

The inverse problem can be formulated as
ˆ − J (d∗ ) | = limh→0,p→∞ mindk ∈Ω |Jh,p dk − J (d∗ ) | (6)
ˆ : |Jh,p d
F ind d
where d∗ denotes exact parameters of the inverse problem (exact solution of
the variational formulation for these parameters is well comparable with experiment data), dk denotes approximated parameters of the inverse problem, Ω is
a set of all admissible parameters dk , J (d∗ ) = E (u (d∗ )) is the energy of the

exact solution u (d∗ ) of the variational problem (2) for exact parameters d∗ ,
Jh,p dk = E uh,p dk is the energy of the solution uh,p dk of the approximated problem (4) for approximated parameters dk .
Objective function error is deﬁned as an energy diﬀerence between the solution
of the approximated problem (4) for approximated parameter dk and the exact
solution of the problem (2) for exact parameter d∗ (assumed to be equal to the
energy of the experiment)
eh,p dk = |Jh,p dk − J (d∗ ) | .

(7)

In other words, the approximated parameter dk is placed into the approximated
formulation (4), the solution of the problem uh,p dk (which depends on dk ) is
computed by FEM, and the energy of the solution E uh,p dk is computed.

The objective function error over the ﬁne mesh is limited by the relative error of

Algorithm

Lemma 2 motivates the following algorithm relating the inverse error with the
objective function error. We start with random initial values of the inverse problem parameters

Compute objective function error
if (objective function error < const * FEM error)
execute one step of the hp adaptivity,
solve the problem on the new coarse and fine FEM meshes
compute FEM error
if (inverse error < required accuracy) stop
end
Inverse error estimation proven in Lemma 2 allows us to perform hp adaptation
in the right moment. If the objective function error is much smaller than the
FEM error, the minimization of the objective function error does not make sense
on current FE mesh, and the mesh quality improvement is needed.

Step-and-Flash Imprint Lithography

The above algorithm will be tested on the SFIL process simulation. The SFIL
is a modern patterning process utilizing photopolymerization to replicate the
topography of a template into a substrate. It can be summarized in the following steps, compare Fig. 2: Dispense - the SFIL process employs a template / substrate alignment scheme to bring a rigid template and substrate into
parallelism, trapping the etch barrier in the relief structure of the template; Imprint - the gap is closed until the force that ensures a thin base layer is reached;
Exposure - the template is then illuminated through the backside to cure etch
barrier; Separate - the template is withdrawn, leaving low-aspect ratio, high resolution features in the etch barrier; Breakthrough Etch - the residual etch barrier
(base layer) is etched away with a short halogen plasma etch; Transfer Edge the pattern is transferred into the transfer layer with an anisotropic oxygen reactive ion etch, creating high-aspect ratio, high resolution features in the organic
transfer layer. The photopolymerization of the feature is often accompanied by
the densiﬁcation, see Fig. 2, which can be modeled by the linear elasticity with
thermal expansion coeﬃcient (CTE) [5]. We may deﬁne the problem: Find u displacement vector ﬁeld, such that

Numerical Results

The proposed algorithm was executed for the problem of ﬁnding the proper
value of the thermal expansion coeﬃcient enforcing shrinkage of the feature
comparable with experiments. The algorithm performed 43 iterations on the
ﬁrst optimal mesh (see the third picture in Fig. 1) providing 15% relative error
of the direct problem solution. Then, the computational mesh was hp reﬁned to
increase the accuracy of the direct solver. The inverse algorithm continued by
utilizing 8% relative error mesh (see the fourth picture in Fig.1) for the direct
problem. After 39 iterations the mesh was again hp reﬁned (see the ﬁfth picture
in Fig.1) to provide 5% relative error of the direct problem solution. After 35
iterations of the inverse algorithm on the most accurate mesh the inverse problem
was solved. The history of the (CTE) parameter convergence on the ﬁrst, second
and third optimal meshes is presented in Fig. 3.

We compared the total execution time equal to 0.1s + 43 × 2 × 0.1s + 1s + 39 ×
2 × 1s + 10s + 35 × 2 × 10s = 8.7 + 79 + 710 = 797.7s with the classical algorithm,
where the inverse problem was solved on the most accurate FEM mesh from

348

the beginning. The classical algorithm required 91 iterations to obtain the same
result. The execution time of the classical algorithm was 10s + 91 × 2 × 10s =
1830s.
This diﬀerence will grow when the inverse algorithm will look for more inverse
problem parameters at the same time, since number of direct problem solutions
necessary to obtain the new propositions of the inverse parameters will grow.

The Molecular Static Model

The energy of the experimental data J(d∗ ) was estimated from the molecular
static model, which provides realistic simulation results, well comparable with
experiments [5]. During the photopolymierization, the Van der Waals bound
between particles forming polymer chain are converted into a stronger covalent
bounds. The average distance between particles is decreasing and the volumetric
contraction of the feature occurs. In the following, a general equations governing the equilibrium conﬁgurations of the molecular lattice structure after the
densiﬁcation and removing of the template are derived.
Let us consider an arbitrary pair of bonded molecules with indices α and β
xα , yˆα , zˆα ). The unknown equilibrium
and given lattice position vector pα = (ˆ
position vector of particle α, under the action of all their intermolecular bonds,
is denoted xα = (xα , yα , zα ), the displacements from the initial position in the
lattice to the equilibrium position is represented by the vector uα = xα − pα .
Let · denote the vector norm or length in R3 , let rαβ = xβ − xα be the
distance between particles α and β in initial conﬁguration. Then, the force Fαβ ,
along the vector xβ − xα is governed by the potential function V (rαβ ),
Fαβ = −

∂V (rαβ )
∂rαβ

xβ − xα
xβ − xα

.

(10)

where ﬁrst term represents the magnitude and second term is the direction. If
the indices of bonded neighboring particles of particle α are collected in the set
Nα , then we obtain its force equilibrium by applying the following sum:
Fαβ = −
β∈Nα

β∈Nα

∂V (rαβ )
∂rαβ

xβ − xα
xβ − xα

=0.

(11)

The characteristics of the potential functions {V (rαβ )}β∈Nα are provided by
the Monte Carlo simulation [5]. The covalent bounds are modeled by spring
forces
(12)
Fαβ = C1 r + C2 .
Spring like potential V (r) is quadratic. The Van der Waals bounds are model
by non-linear forces and the Lennard-Jones potentials

Conclusions and Future Work

– The proper balance of errors of global optimization method and direct problem solvers allows for eﬃcient speeding up the solution process of diﬃcult
inverse problems. The analytic relation among both errors is necessary.
– The relation between the objective function error and the relative error of
the hp-adaptive FEM has been derived. The objective error was expressed as
the energy diﬀerence between the numerical solution and experiment data.
– The strategy relating the convergence ratios of the inverse and direct problem
solution has been proposed and successfully tested for searching value of
the CTE parameter in the SFIL process. We obtained about 2.4 speedup
in comparison to the solution without error balancing for the simple test
example. The higher speedup may be expected for problems with larger
dimension.
– The future work will include derivation of analytic relations between the hpadaptive FEM error and objective function error deﬁned in other ways. The
possibilities of further speeding up of the solver will be tested by utilizing
the parallel version of the hp-adaptive FEM codes [3].
