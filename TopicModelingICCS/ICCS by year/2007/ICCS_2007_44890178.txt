Abstract. An immune neural network (INN) is proposed for water mine model
recognition. The INN is a two-layer Boolean network whose number of outputs
is adaptive according to the task and the affinity threshold. The precision of the
recognition results can be controlled through adjusting the affinity threshold.
The INN has favorable capability of noise tolerance.
Keywords: water mine model, recognition, immune neural network.

1 Introduction
It is necessary for mine countermeasure systems to recognize the model of a water
mine. Most of the previous researches on mine countermeasures [1][2][3] focused
main attentions on the detection and classification of water mines. But the previous
approaches can only classify the detected object as two classes, i.e., mine-like or not.
In this paper, an immune neural network (INN) is constructed based on a modified
clonal selection operation for water mine model recognition.

2 Immune Neural Network
Represent the feature data of water mines as an antigen population Ag={Ag1, Ag2…
Agn}. An antigen can be represented as l-length bit string. Each bit represents a
feature. The antibody repertoire, Ab={Ab1, Ab2,…, Abm}, will be modeled as a Boolean
competitive network with l inputs, called INN. Employ an l-dimensional vector wj
represents the weights connecting the inputs to the output unit j. Define the affinity Aij
as the Hamming distance between Agi and Abj. For each Agi, vi indexing the highest
affinity antibody. The antigens concentration cj for Abj can be calculated according to
Eq.(1),
n

cj =

∑ iif(v

i

= j ,1,0) ,

(1)

i =1

where, iif(vi = j, 1, 0) means that if vi = j holds then return 1 else 0. Define e as an
affinity threshold. For Agi and Abj, if l–Aij > e then we can say that Agi and Abj are

matched. Define mj as an affinity maturation indicator. If mj is True then stop cloning
antibody Abj. For antibody Abj and arbitrary i∈{i | vi = j}, if l-Aij > e holds, then set mj
= True as Eq.(2),
mj =

∧

(l − Aij > e) .

(2)

i∈{i|vi = j}

We developed a modified clonal selection algorithm for constructing an INN:
1) Initiate an INN with n antigens Ag1, Ag2… Agn and 1 antibody Ab1. For each integer
i∈[1, n], set vi = 1. Set each bit of wi to 1. Set c1 = n, m1 = False. Set e to an
appropriate value.
2) Determine the candidate Abj to be cloned according to Eq.(3). If j is null then stop
else continue step 3) to clone Abj.

j = arg max c j , where O = { j | c j > 1 ∧ m j = False}
j∈O

(3)

3) Select the worst matching Agi of Abj according to Eq.(4),
i = arg min Aij .
i∈{i|vi = j }

(4)

4) Clone a new antibody Abk with the weights wk of its antibody are the exact
complement of Agi, then add Abk to INN.
5) For each antigen Agi, update vi. For each antibody Abj, update cj and mj.
6) If all antibodies are mature then delete the antibodies with c=0 and stop, else goto
step 2).
When the algorithm (MCSA for short) stops, an INN is constructed, each output of
which represents one or several antigen patterns, i.e., water mine models. The number
of patterns that an output represents is determined by the affinity threshold e. When e
= 0, one output corresponds to one pattern. The bigger the value of e is, the more
patterns an output represents along with the lower precision.
The process of recognition is very simple. Given an antigen Agi as input, the INN
computes the antibody being activated according to Eq.(5), then the water mine model
can be recognized.
j = arg max Aij ,
j∈O

where O = { j | l − Aij > e}

(5)

There is no output can be activated if O=Ф, which means that Agi cannot be
recognized, i.e., the water mine is not any known model or may be it is not a water
mine at all.

3 Simulation Experiments
For constructing an INN, a water mine data set with models and binary attributes was
prepared as shown in Table 1. We applied MCSA to the data set with setting l=20,
n=21, and e=0, which means that the MCSA will create a network with antibodies
highly specific for each input pattern (antigen). Thus, it would be expected that the

final network was composed of 21 antibodies, but the resultant network contained
only 18 antibodies. This is because that the models (e.g., NM103 and WSM210)
mapped into the same node are described as the same attribute strings.

In most cases, the sensor data may be incomplete or inaccurate. The INN can easily
deal with these cases by adjusting the value of the affinity threshold e when
recognizes, which can be demonstrated by the following experiments. Random noise
was inserted into the learning samples in Table 1 by simply reverting a bit 0 into a 1,
or vice-versa. We tested eleven different noise levels from 0% to 50%, corresponding
to the shift of 0 to 10 bits, respectively. The INN was tested for different values of the
affinity threshold e from 0 to 10, and a correct recognition (CR) is assumed when the
network maps the corrupted pattern into the same node as the original pattern. Fig.1
depicts the experiment results that are the average taken over ten runs. Fig.1 shows
that the CR is affected both by the number of noise bits and the affinity threshold e.
Keeping a value of e constant, the CR decreases almost linearly with the noise level
increasing. If we keep a constant noise level, the CR increases nonlinearly, i.e., the
CR almost keeps constant when the value of e is bigger than the number of noise bits.

In these experiments, we did not take into account the effect of adjusting the affinity
threshold e when the INN is constructed. Apparently, the value of e in recognition
should be equal to or bigger than that in construction. It is an acceptable strategy to
set e in recognition to a bigger value when the noise level is uncertain.

4 Conclusions
The INN is a two-layer Boolean network whose number of outputs is adaptive according to the task and the affinity threshold, which is significant for solving machinelearning problems, such as knowledge acquisition and classification. The precision of
recognition result can be controlled through adjusting the affinity threshold, which
endows INN with satisfied noise tolerance capability. In the future, we will apply the
INN to underwater minesweepers.
