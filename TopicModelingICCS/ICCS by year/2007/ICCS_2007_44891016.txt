Abstract. In this paper, we give a new deﬁnition of risk: a scene in the
future associated with some adverse incident. The simplest scene is that,
a stone is hooked over our head. When a wind comes, the stone would
fall down on our head. In many cases, what can we do is to approximately represent risks. In this paper, we suggest an approach to infer
risks with information described in natural language. With fuzzy logic,
we give a sample to verify that the suggested approach is more ﬂexible
and eﬀective.
Keywords: Risk Analysis; Natural Language; Fuzzy Logic.

Introduction

All goals of developing science and technology are speciﬁed three categorizations for daily life: (1) Producing high quality goods with low variable costs; (2)
Exploring the mystery of the world; (3)Providing safety.
Five years ago, the world witnessed an unprecedented attack on the civilized
world. The attacks of 9/11 shocked men and women everywhere, and images
from that day remain etched in the minds of all of us who saw them. On that
dreadful day, al-Qaida’s hijack crews stole the future from nearly 3000 innocent
people, devastating the lives of their families and friends.
Since then, the content of concept of safety is much relevant to homeland
security and personal safety against terrorism. The aftermath of the attacks also
clearly demonstrates the spirit of the civilized world and the enormous capacity
of this world to unite; to coordinate eﬀorts among civilized countries, organizations, as well as among private businesses, community groups, and individual
citizens in response to a crisis; and to make the sacriﬁces necessary to respond
both to these new threats and the consequences they entail.
Our challenge is to build upon a renewed purpose in ways that create both
short- and long-term beneﬁts and allow us to sustain our eﬀorts. As a result, we
must ﬁnd the best ways to sustain our eﬀorts over a signiﬁcant time period and
leverage our ﬁnite resources in ways that will have the greatest eﬀects.

An eﬀective framework to address these challenges will require a risk management approach to focus ﬁnite resources on areas of greatest need.
However, although the United States of America has the greatest number of
high-technology tools, until now it does not have a comprehensive risk management approach [5] to help guiding federal programs for homeland security and
apply their resources eﬃciently and to best eﬀect. One of the main reasons why
it is diﬃcult to promote risk management in the new safety issue is that users
have little conﬁdence in the results of their risk analysis from incomplete data
in a short time for a very complex system. In this paper, we will suggest an
approach to study the information described in natural language for improving
risk analysis.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a new deﬁnition of risk
and a sample scene of risk. We outline of some methodologies for risk analysis
and indicate their disadvantage in Section 3. We suggest an approach to infer
risks with information described in natural language in Section 4. With fuzzy
logic, in Section 5, we give a sample to verify that the suggested approach is
more ﬂexible and eﬀective. We conclude the paper in Section 6.

A New Deﬁnition of Risk

Safety is the state of being certain that adverse eﬀects will not be caused by
some agent under deﬁned conditions. The reciprocal of safety is risk.
There is no widely accepted deﬁnition of risk. Four items are found for risk
in Webster Dictionary:
(1) Possibility of loss or injury;
(2) Someone or something that creates or suggests a hazard;
(3) a: The chance of loss or the perils to the subject matter of an insurance
contract; also: the degree of probability of such loss.
b: A person or thing that is a speciﬁed hazard to an insurer <a poor risk
for insurance>.
c: An insurance hazard from a speciﬁed cause or source <war risk>.
(4) The chance that an investment (as a stock or commodity) will lose value.
Obviously, the core of all deﬁnitions of risk is the same: risk exists when loss is
possible and its ﬁnancial impact is signiﬁcant. This linguistic deﬁnition captures
a property of risk that eludes deﬁnition in terms of mathematical formulas where
risk had been deﬁned as the probability per unit time of the occurrence of a unit
cost burden [4].
But, what on earth is risk, anyway? Is it “loss”? “probability”? or “probability
of loss”? No, they are not. They are at most features of risk. In fact, risk is a
synthetic phenomenon that would be described in Deﬁnition 1.
Deﬁnition 1. Risk is a scene in the future associated with some adverse incident.

Scene means something seen by a viewer; a view or prospect. Adverse is contrary to one’s interests or welfare; harmful or unfavorable.
A scene must be described with a system consisting of time, site and objects.
The association would be measured with a metric space (such as probability).
And, incident would be scaled with a magnitude (such as loss).
It is interesting to notice that, the concept of risk in Chinese is represented in
two Chinese characters: “feng” and “xian,” the former means “wind”, and the
latter “danger.”
The risk meaning described in Chinese leads to a sample scene: a stone is
hooked over our head. When a wind comes, the stone would fall down on our
head. If the stone is small, or the hook can ﬁrmly hold the stone, any wind
doesn’t matter for us with respect to the stone. Otherwise, we have to take some
prevention measure. Meanwhile, one day, the stone may fall down without any
wind if the hook is made of wood. In the scene, there are three objects: stone,
wind and our head. The wind would be replace by another force. For example,
moth eats the wooden hook.

Outline of Some Methodologies for Risk Analysis

Risk management is the process of evaluating and, if necessary, controlling
sources of exposure and risk. The culture, processes and structures that are directed towards the eﬀective management of potential opportunities and adverse
eﬀects.
Risk evaluation is the process used to determine risk management priorities
by comparing the level of risk against predetermined standards, target risk levels
or other criteria.
Risk analysis is a systematic use of available information to determine how
often speciﬁed events may occur and the magnitude of their consequences.
Risk assessment is the overall process of risk analysis and risk evaluation.
Strictly speaking, risk management covers the hazard identiﬁcation and risk
analysis, but focuses on executing, monitoring and controlling. On the other
hand, risk analysts often divide risk analysis into these components: risk assessment, risk management and risk communication.
According to Deﬁnition 1, we know that the risk is a scene. Therefore, we
refer to risk management as an appropriate activation so that our environment
will become more safe, and refer to risk analysis as a scientiﬁcally description of
a risk system so that the risk management will become more eﬀective.
There have been appearing a lot of risk analysis methodologies. Among them,
the following 11 methodologies are more popular.

Failure Modes, Eﬀects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA);
Failure Mode and Eﬀect Analysis (FMEA);
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA);
Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP);
Cause Consequence Analysis (CCA);
Management Oversight Risk Tree (MORT);

(7) Safety Management Organization Review Technique (SMORT);
(8) Risk Analysis Bibliographies (RAB);
(9) Security/Survivability Systems Analysis (S/SSA);
(10) Cost-Eﬀectiveness Analysis in Emergency Medicine, Computer (CEA);
(11) Cost Beneﬁt Analysis (CAB)
Most of them involve the assumption that a risk system can be decomposed
into several subsystems where the corresponding risks are known. For example,
FTA is a deductive procedure for determining the various combinations of hardware and software failures, and human errors that could result in the occurrence
of speciﬁed undesired events. Another example: one of basic steps in an FMEA
is to enter the probability factor where a numerical weight should be assigned
to each cause that indicates how likely that cause is (probability of the cause
occurring).
In the cognitive viewpoint, there are four diﬀerent types of societal risks [3]:
(T1) Real risk to an individual — eventually by future circumstances when
they fully develop;
(T2) Statistical risk — determined by currently available data, typically measured actuarially for insurance premium and other purposes;
(T3) Predicted risk — predicted analytically from system models structured
from historical studies;
(T4) Perceived risk — intuitively seen by individuals.
Therefore, the methodologies for risk analysis also can be speciﬁed four categorizations: (1) Investigating the current scene; (2) Statistically inferencing; (3)
Modelling the future scene; (4) Evaluating with expert experiences.
Obviously, the core of risk analysis is not to combine the subsystems but to
analyze the subsystems. The main disadvantage of these methodologies is that
they depend on so much assumptions for subsystems, such as that we can ﬁnd a
statistical rule to show the risk phenomenon properly, or ﬁnd some state equations to describe risk systems, or acquire expert experiences to understand the
risk phenomenon. The real cases told us, it is diﬃcult to verify if the assumptions
are reasonable.
Beck [1] viewed the increasing focus on risk as the consciousness of a new stage
of development in society. The return of uncertainty is the diﬀerence between
an industrial society and a risk society. If it is barely possible to analyze risks
in industrial societies with explicit assumptions, it will be impossible to analyze
risks in post-modern societies with these assumptions. In many cases, only a few
pieces of information in massive information are available; the environment is
not clear and we are required to response quickly. We have to make a decision
in an uncertain environment with fuzzy information as soon as possible. It is
impossible to accurately analyze risks in complex systems. In the future, we
would have to analyze risks by computing with words [7], or with images, in
which we would process fuzzy information more eﬃciently. Fuzzy set theory is
created to computing with words.

Inferring Risks with Information Described in Natural
Language

Computation with information described in natural language, or NLcomputation for short, is a problem of intrinsic importance because much of
human knowledge is described in natural language [8]
Basically, NL-Computation is a system of computation in which the objects
of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. NLComputation is reduced to computation with generalized constraints, that is, to
generalized-constraint-based computation. NL-Computation is based on fuzzy
logic. NL-Computation is closely related to Computing with Words (CW).
Here is an example of NL-Computation in risk analysis. A middle stone is
hooked over our head with a wooden hook. If a storm comes, the stone would
fall down on our head. It is called a stone-hook-wind system (SHW-system). Our
task is to analyze what risk, with high possibility, we have to bear if we don’t
take any prevention measure?
Let E be risk in values: yes (the stone will fall down) or no , X be the features
of the hook (strength and fastness), and Y be the features of the storm (force
and frequency). X, Y are imprecisely described in natural language. Particularly,
Y is a fuzzy random vector. The risk analysis is to calculate:
P rob(E = yes) with high possibility.

(1)

In general, we are used to calculate P rob(E = yes) by using observations based
on some distribution assumptions or non-parametric method. However, now,
we haven’t any observation, but only information described in natural language
about stone, hook and wind. It is impossible to directly calculate P rob(E = yes)
by using any traditional method.
The approach to NL-computation centers on what is referred to as generalizedconstraint-based computation. A generalized constraint is expressed as “X isr
A,” where X is the constrained variable, A is a constraining relation and r is an
indexical variable which deﬁnes the way in which A constrains X.
NL-computation cannot be dealt with through the use of machinery of natural
language processing. The problem is semantic imprecision of natural languages.
More speciﬁcally, a natural language is basically a system for describing perceptions. Perceptions are intrinsically imprecise, reﬂecting the bounded ability of
sensory organs, and ultimately the brain, to resolve detail and store information. Semantic imprecision of natural languages is a concomitant of imprecision
of perceptions.
To a SHW-system, there is no loss of generality in assuming that “X isr1 A”
and “Y isr2 B”, where
X = {X1 , X2 } = {strength, f astness},

(2)

Y = {Y1 , Y2 } = {f orce, f requency},

(3)

r1 = {r11 , r12 } = {blank, blank},

(4)

r2 = {r21 , r22 } = {p, p},

(5)

where blank means the possibilistic constraint and p means the probabilistic
constraint. Then,
P rob(E = yes) with high possibility

(6)

= P rob(B|E = yes with high possibility determined by A).

A Calculation Case

The information for our case is that a middle stone is hooked over our head with
a strong wooden hook almost fast. If the hook doesn’t hold the stone absolutely
fast, when a wind comes, the stone would fall down. The winds more than 40
km/h have been frequently observed in this region.
What risk do we face?
Let E be risk in values: 1 or 0 (down or not down). Let X be the fastness of
that the hook holds the stone, with universe:
U = {u1 , u2 , · · · , u11 } = {0, 0.1, · · · , 1},
Y be the intensity (km/h) of a wind, with universe:
V = {v1 , v2 , · · · , v12 } = {0, 10, · · · , 110}.
From the information about the SHW-system, speciﬁcally described in natural
language, we obtain:
X is A

Suppose that, from information “If the hook doesn’t hold the stone absolutely
fast, when a wind comes, the stone would fall down,” we obtain a falling table
determined by u and v, shown in Table 1, where 1 means that the stone will fall
down, and 0 means the hook can hold the stone.
We suppose that, the information “The winds more than 40 km/h have been
frequently observed in this region” can be interpreted as that the average intensity of the wind is 40 km/h. Because the number of weak winds is much more
than the number of strong winds, we suppose the probability distribution of the
intensity is exponential.

Then, we obtain a probability distribution of the intensity of a wind:
p(v) = 0.025e−0.025v .
Table 1 can be regarded as a fuzzy relation matrix between fastness and
intensity, constrained by falling phenomena. From input “almost fast”, with the
max-min composition [2], we obtain an output B, called strong wind, that makes
the stone falls, with membership function:

Therefore, we know that, the risk we face is

= 0.178154

i.e., the probability of that the stone falls is 0.178154 with high possibility. From
the given information described in natural language, it is impossible to accurately
calculate the probability of the falling of the stone. Here, the probability value
0.178154 is induced by using fuzzy logic. Because the inference is comparatively
reliable, the value 0.178154 can be regarded one near real probability with high
possibility.

Conclusion and Discussion

Risk is a scene in the future associated with some adverse incident. This linguistic
deﬁnition can capture all properties of risk that eludes deﬁnition in terms of
mathematical formulas.
It is possible to analyze risk with information described in natural language.
The fuzzy logic can be used to quantify the information and infer the risk where
computation with information described in natural language is reduced to computation with generalized constraints, that is, to generalized-constraint-based
computation.
The basic condition to compute risk with information described in natural
language is that we can understand the semantic in the information and change
it into constraints. With the same information described in natural language,
diﬀerent experts would infer diﬀerent risks due to diﬀerent backgrounds. Therefore, any risk inferred from the natural language is soft. To limit the soft degree,
it is necessary to form a set of kernel terms used to describe risk so that diﬀerent
experts have almost same understanding for each term in the set.
