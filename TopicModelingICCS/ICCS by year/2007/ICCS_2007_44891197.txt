Abstract. Based on the random ﬁeld theory and reliability theory, the
statistical methods used in the research on the probabilistic features of
parameters,Ps ,fi ,Psb had been studied. In addition, the problems with
the correlation distance, pile cross section dimensions and the range of
pile tip resistance, which would be used in the reliability analysis, were
discussed in this paper. The reliability analyses were made on seventeen (17) construction sites based on forty-six (46) CPT test curves in
Shanghai area, China. The reliability indices were obtained and the probabilistic characteristics of reliability indices were derived accordingly.The
study shows that: (1) generally, the reliability index of large pile in diameter is greater than that of small pile for either prefabricated pile
or cast-in-place pile, and the coeﬃcient of variation of reliability index
of prefabricated pile is less than that of cast-in-place pile; and (2) For
bored piles, the variation coeﬃcient of reliability index is less for big
pile in diameter (or dimensions) than that for small pile in diameter (or
dimensions). . . .
Keywords: Random ﬁeld, Correlation distance, Reliability, CPT, Vertical bearing capacity of pile.

Introduction

Traditionally, the safety factor, K, is used to express whether the design of pile
bearing capacity is risk or conservative. Apparently, if K is larger, the design
is safer, but it is not in fact. The reliability analysis with consideration of the
variation of variables has become one of the hot points in the civil engineering
area in the past twenty years. The researchers in the geotechinical engineering
community are still facing challenges to apply the reliability analysis in their
design since the nature of the variety of the soil and rock properties is diﬃcult
to recognize and the failure mode for geotechnical engineering objects is much
vague. Nevertheless, the endeavor is continuing internationally. Many scholars
in China have done a lot of research work to ﬁnd a way to transit the traditional
foundation design code,which is based on the deterministic design method, to a
new foundation design code based on the reliability analysis. In this paper,the

authors will present such research results with the vertical pile bearing capacity
for prefabricated piles and the bored piles.

Formulae for Determining Limit Bearing Capacity of
Pile

As the scenario of bored pile is much complex and it is still a technical challenge
to make clear the borehole cross section dimensions, the slurry thickness and
their functions inﬂuencing the bearing capacity of bored pile, seldom foundation design codes and guidelines recommend the formulae to determine the limit
bearing capacity of bored pile by means of CPT. However, the extensive usage
of bored pile in many area around the world and the CPT technology is widely
used to estimate the soil engineering properties, it is necessary to explore the
possibility to evaluate the bearing capacity for bored pile using the CPT results.
Some scholars including the authors have done limited researches in this area
(Zhao etc., 1999; Chen etc., 1994). The formula adopted for studying the reliability of evaluating the bearing capacity of bored pile by means of the speciﬁc
penetration resistance of CPT is apparently same with equation (1), but the
methods for evaluating the variables involved in equation (2) are diﬀerent, i.e.,
n

Qu =

fi Ui li + ab Psb Ap

(1)

i=1

Where Qu is the bearing capacity of single pile (kN), fi is the standard value of
ultimate friction resistance for the i-th soil layer by means of the speciﬁc penetration resistance of CPT (kPa); Ui and li represent the average perimeter of pile
and the thickness for the i-th soil layer respectively; ab is the modiﬁed coeﬃcient
for pile end resistance; Psb is the average speciﬁc penetration resistance of CPT
near the pile end (kPa); Ap is the cross section area of pile end (m2); n is the
number of soil layer that pile penetrates.

Calculation Methods of the Probabilistic Features of
the Speciﬁc Penetration Resistance Ps

For the standard values of the ultimate friction resistance and ultimate end resistance are evaluated based on the speciﬁc penetration resistance Ps of CPT
according to empirical formulae, their probabilistic characteristics will depend
on the statistical methods, i.e., how to get the parameter of Ps . The Ps value of
CPT varies continuously along with the penetration depth, so the question that
how the Ps value is calculated based on the CPT test curve for a foundation soil
layer arises. As there is autocorrelation of soil parameters, and the independence
of choosing individual Ps value should be guaranteed. The probabilistic properties (variance and variation coeﬃcient) of Ps value should be evaluated taking
the correlation distance of typical soil layer in shanghai area into consideration.

The calculated variance is so called ‘point variance’, and the variation coeﬃcient
based on point variance can be gotten. Then authors obtain the variation coeﬃcient for a soil layer based on one-dimensional random ﬁeld theory (Vanmarcke,
1977), i.e.,
δi,0
(2)
Vi = Vi
li
Where Vi represents the variation coeﬃcient derived from the point variance for
the i -th soil layer of a CPT hole, Vi is the variation coeﬃcient derived from
one-dimensional random ﬁeld theory for the i-th soil layer of the CPT hole, δi,0
is the correlation distance for the i-th soil layer, li refers to the thickness for the
i-th soil layer.
Preceding discussion only considers the soil parameter variation along depth;
the variability in horizontal direction also needs to be taken into account. For
there are only a few CPT holes and the distances between holes of CPT are
relatively large in a construction site, the random variable theory was adopted
to calculate spatial average variance of a site approximately. The spatial variation
coeﬃcient Vhi is evaluated by Equation (3):
1
Vi = Vh √
m

(3)

Where Vh is the variation coeﬃcient for a site, which is calculated based on the
point variance; m is the number of the hole of CPT.
3.1

The Method for Evaluating Ps in a Site

While calculating the statistical properties of the CPT speciﬁc resistance, Ps , by
means of random ﬁeld theory, very probably, the thickness of soil layer cannot
be divided by the correlation distance neatly. For solving the question, the practical thickness is divided by correlation distance, then round oﬀ to the nearest
whole number, the real thickness of soil layer is replaced by the multiplication of
the correlation distance and the round number. As shown in Fig.1, where hil is
thickness of the CPT hole for the i-th soil layer, hil is the soil layer thickness used
in the calculation. Here i represents the serial number of soil layer, i = 1, · · · , n;
l refers to the serial number of CPT hole in one site, l = 1, · · · , m. The process
of evaluating the statistical properties of Ps is as followed.
(1) Rounding

to a nearest whole number, N, then replacing the real soil

layer thickness by hil = N · δi,0 .
(2) Averaging Ps in the range of hil to obtain P sil , calculating the standard
point variance σsil and the point variation coeﬃcient Vsil of Ps .
(3) Calculating the average standard variance σsil and average variation coeﬃcient Vsil of Psil in the range of hil , i.e.,

The Methods for Evaluating the Friction Resistance fi

In the case of bored pile, as the pile diameter is inﬂuenced by several factors, such
as the soil properties, the construction process and quality, it is still a diﬃcult
task in the civil engineering community to get the statistical properties of the
diameter of bored pile. One thing is clear, whether for a single soil layer or for
the total soil layers along the pile shaft, the shaft friction resistance calculated
according to the estimated pile diameter should be equivalent to the practical
friction resistance. The author has made attempt to deal with the problem (Zhao,
1998). In this paper, the diameter of the bored pile is assumed as the design
diameter for lacking test data. For the bored pile, the side friction resistance fi
of the i-th soil layer can be written as,
2
fi = a + bPsi + cPsi

(8)

Where a,b,c are coeﬃcients, which can be evaluated based on the soil properties.
(1) For shallow topsoil (the depth is not beyond 6m),
a = 15kP a

b=c=0

(9)

(2) For clay, whose average speciﬁc resistance satisﬁes Psl ≤ 5000kP a ,
a = 8.775kP a

c = −2.551 × 10−6

b = 0.029

(10)

(3) For clay, whose average speciﬁc resistance satisﬁes P sl ≥ 5000kP a
a = 90kP a

b=c=0

(11)

(4) For clay (P sl ≥ 15000kP a) , sandy silt, and sand,
a = 18.705kP a

b = 0.010

c = −3.498

(12)

(5) For clay (P sl ≥ 000kP a), sandy silt, and sand,
a = 90kP a

b=c=0

(13)

While bearing stratum is sand or silt and the pile end penetrates into this layer
less than 10 d ( d represents the design pile diameter), the side friction resistance
in the range of 4 d above the pile end should be modiﬁed as follow,
fi∗ = ηfi ,

(η = 0.5)

(14)

Supposing Psi subject to normal distribution, the statistical properties of side
friction resistance, fi , for the bored pile can be derived based on Equation (8)
and the error propagation theory, viz.,
2

f i = a + bP si + c P si + σP2 si

The Methods for Evaluating the Pile Tip Resistance
Psb

The evaluating methods of statistic property of the tip resistance Psb for bored
pile are similar to the methods for the prefabricated pile, but the calculating
range for the bored pile is diﬀerent, it includes 4D (D refers to the diameter of
the bored pile) above the pile end and 1D under the pile end, as showed in ﬁg. 2
(Chen Qianghua, etc., 1994). The methods for evaluating the statistic properties
of the tip resistance Psb for the bored pile are brieﬂy discussed as followed.

speciﬁc penetration resistance,P il1 and the average variation coeﬃcient, Vil , in
the range of x1 + x2 for the l-th CPT hole are evaluated by equation (18).

layer in the l-th CPT hole and the variation coeﬃcient, Vi2 , for i-th soil layer

Reliability Analysis and the Results

The limit state equation of the pile bearing capacity failure model for the bored
pile can be written as,
n

(25)

i=1

This is a linear equation, which contains n + 3 variables. That all these basic
variables are subject to normal distribution is presumed herein, the reliability
index,β , can be calculated on equation (37).

Where mPsb mfi ,mQG ,mQL are the average of corresponding variables, σPsb ,σfi ,

The results of reliability on the bored pile in seventeen (17) construction sites in
Shanghai area are presented in table 3. In the calculation of the reliability index,
β , based on JC method, the safety factor K = 2 is assumed, the bored piles
with diﬀerent diameters (650mm and 800mm) are considered, and the diﬀerent
load ratios (0.2 and 0.5) are set in the computation.
It should be noted that the variation of the analysis mode and the bored pile
diameter weren’t taken into account in the above reliability analyses. If these
factors were considered, the reliability indexes would decrease in theory. These
problems deﬁnitely need further research work.
