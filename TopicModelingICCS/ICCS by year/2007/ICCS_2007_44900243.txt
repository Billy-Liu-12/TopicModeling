Abstract. The main problem of time-frequency atom decomposition
(TFAD) lies in an extremely high computational load. This paper presents a fast implementation method based on quantum-inspired genetic
algorithm (QGA). Instead of ﬁnding the optimal atom in greedy implementation algorithm, this method is to search a satisfactory atom in
every iteration of TFAD. Making full use of QGA’s advantages such as
good global search capability, rapid convergence and short computing
time, the method reduces greatly the computational load of TFAD. Experiments conducted on radar emitter signals verify the eﬀectiveness and
practicality of the introduced method.
Keywords: Quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, time-frequency atom
decomposition, fast implementation algorithm.

Introduction

Time-frequency atom decomposition (TFAD), also known as matching pursuit
or adaptive Gabor representation [1,2], was introduced independently in [3] and
[4]. TFAD is an approach that decomposes any signal into a linear expansion of
waveforms selected from a redundant dictionary of time-frequency atoms that
well localized both in time and frequency [3]. Unlike Wigner and Cohen class
distributions, the energy distribution obtained by TFAD does not include interference terms. Diﬀerent from Fourier and Wavelet orthogonal transforms, the
information in TFAD is not diluted across the whole basis [3]. Hence, TFAD
has become an attractive analysis technique in signal processing and harmonic
analysis [1, 3-5]. However, the the necessary dictionary of time-frequency atoms
being very large, the computational load turns out to be the main problem of
TFAD [2]. After a greedy algorithm was presented in [3], several fast implementation algorithms were introduced in [6-9]. Although genetic algorithm was used
to reduce the computational load in [1,2,6-8], this problem need be studied further by using some unconventional computation methods with some advantages
over conventional genetic algorithms.

This paper introduces quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QGA) into TFAD
to lower the computational complexity. Based on the concepts of quantum computing, QGA falls into the latest category of unconventional computation. Due
to some outstanding advantages such as good global search capability, rapid convergence and short computing time [10-12], QGA is able to accelerate greatly
the process of searching the most satisfactory time-frequency atom in each iteration of TFAD. In Section 2, the detailed algorithm of QGA based TFAD is
described. Next, some experiments are conducted on radar emitter signals in
Section 3. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.

(i) In the ﬁrst step, the initial iteration T is set to 1. The original signal,
represented linearly by time-frequency atoms, is loaded from the database
or generated in simulation way. Let f be the original signal, f ∈ H, where

Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm Based TFAD

245

H is a Hilbert space. By using TFAD, the signal f can be represented
with a linear expansion of time-frequency atoms that are dilations, translations, and modulations of a single window function gγ ( gγ = 1) [3].
Let D = {gγ }γ∈Γ , where Γ is the set of the index γ that is composed of y
parameters, i.e. γ = (γ1 , γ2 , · · · , γy ). In this paper, time-frequency atom
uses Gabor function:
1
t−u
gγ (t) = √ g(
) cos(νt + ω) .
s
s

(1)

where the index γ=(s, u, ν, ω) is a set of parameters and s, u, ν, ω are scale,
translation, frequency and phase, respectively. g(·) is a Gauss-modulated
window function as
2
g(t) = e−πt .
(2)
In the index γ=(s, u, ν, ω), there are four parameters to optimize. The
method for choosing the four parameters is γ = (cx , bcx Δu, dc−x Δν, zΔω),
c = 1.5, Δu = 1/2, Δν = π, Δω = π/6, 0 < x ≤ log2 L, 0 < b ≤ L/2x−1 ,
0 ≤ z ≤ 12, 0 ≤ d ≤ 2x+1 , where L is the length of the signal f [3].
(ii) In TFAD, the maximal number of iteration is usually used as the termination condition.
(iii) The initial values of some parameters in QGA are set. The parameters
include population size N , the number y=4 of variables, the number m
of binary bits of each variable, the maximal evolutionary generation g
of QGA for searching the sub-optimal time-frequency atom in the overcomplete dictionary (i.e. in each iteration), immigration generation Mg
and catastrophe generation Cg .
(iv) In this step, population P (g)={pg1 , pg2 , · · · , pgN }, where pgi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N )
is an arbitrary individual in population and pgi is represented as
pgi =

αgi1 |αgi2 | · · · |αgi(my)
g
g
g
βi1
|βi2
| · · · |βi(my)

.

(3)

√
g
= 1/ 2 (j = 1, 2,· · ·, my), which means that all states are
where αgij = βij
g
superposed with the same probability. Here, αgij and βij
(j = 1, 2, · · · , my)
are the probability amplitudes of one qubit and satisfy the normalization
equality: |α|2 + |β|2 = 1, where |α|2 and |β|2 are the probabilities that the
qubit will be observed in ‘0’ state and in ‘1’ state in the act of observing
the quantum state.
(v) According to probability amplitudes of all individuals in P (g), observation
states R(g) is constructed by observing P (g). Here R(g)={ag1 , ag2 ,· · ·, agN },
where agi (i = 1, 2,· · · , N ) is an observation state of an individual. agi is a
binary string with the length of my, that is agi = b1 b2 · · · bmy , where bj
(j = 1, 2, · · · , my) is one binary number ‘0’ or ‘1’. Observation states R(g)
is generated in probabilistic way. For the probability amplitude [α β]T of
a qubit, a random number r in the range [0, 1] is generated. If r < |α|2 ,
the corresponding observation value is set to ‘0’, otherwise, the value is set

246

G. Zhang and H. Rong

to ‘1’. In the process of constructing observation state R(g) using P (g),
the decoding operation in conventional genetic algorithm is included. After decoding, the parameter values of all optimization parameters can be
obtained.
(vi) The value of ﬁtness function of each individual in population is computed
by using the values of y variables and each individual in population is
evaluated. Here, the ﬁtness is chosen as | f, gγ |. The reason is as follows.
The signal f will be decomposed into f = f, gγ gγ + Rf , where Rf is the
residual signal after approximating f in the direction of gγ . Obviously, gγ
is orthogonal to Rf . So the following equality can be obtained [3].
f

2

= | f, gγ |2 + Rf

2

.

(4)

In (4), only if | f, gγ | (gγ ∈ D) is maximum, Rf will be minimum.
(vii) The best solution in P (g) at generation g is stored into B(g).
(viii) According to probability amplitudes of all individuals in P (g − 1), observation states R(g) is constructed by observing P (g − 1). This step is
similar to step (v). The detailed procedures have been described.
(ix) This step is similar to step (vi).
(x) The probability amplitudes of all qubits in population are updated by
using quantum rotation gates given in (5).
G=

cos θ − sin θ
sin θ cos θ

.

(5)

where θ is the rotation angle of quantum rotation gate and θ is deﬁned as
θ = k · f (α, β) .

(6)

where k is a coeﬃcient whose value has a direct eﬀect on convergent speed
of QGA. In this paper, k is deﬁned as a variable, which is relative to the
evolutionary generation g. A kind of deﬁnition of k is given in (7).
k=

π − mod(g,100)
10
e
.
2

(7)

where mod(g,100) is a function for computing modulus after g is divided
by 100. k varies from π/2 to 0, which indicates QGA searches the optimal
solution at large grid at the beginning of the algorithm and then the search
grid declines gradually to 0 as the evolutionary generation g increases to
100. When the evolutionary generation g amounts to 100, the value of
k comes back to π/2. f (α, β) is a function for determining the search
direction of QGA to a global optimum. The look-up table of f (α, β) is
shown in Table 1, in which ξ1 = arctan(β1 /α1 ) and ξ2 = arctan(β2 /α2 ),
where α1 , β1 are the probability amplitudes of the best solution stored in
B(g) and α2 , β2 are the probability amplitudes of the current solution [12].
Thus, the formula for updating an individual pgi in P (g) using quantum
rotation gate G can be described as
pg+1
= G(g) · pgi .

where g is evolutionary generation, G(g) stands for the gth generation
quantum rotation gate, pgi and pg+1
are the probability amplitudes at gth
i
generation and at (g + 1)th generation, respectively. Once the probability
amplitudes of all individuals in P (g) are updated using quantum rotation
gate, the individuals in the next generation are generated.
The best solution among P (g) and B(g − 1) is stored into B(g).
When immigration operation is made every Mg generation, the 10% of
probability amplitudes in the stored best individual are replaced by the
new probability amplitudes generated using the similar method in step
(ii). That is, each α is a random value from 0 to 1 and corresponding β
equals ± 1 − |α|2 . How to choose Mg is discussed in the next section.
If the best solution stored in B(g) is not changed in many generations,
such as Cg generations, then population catastrophe operation should be
performed.
The residual signal R(T +1) f is R(T +1) f = RT f − RT f, gγT gγT . The
residual signal is used as the original signal in the next iteration.

After the signal f is decomposed up to the order T , f can be represented with
the concatenated sum
T

f, gγi gγi + RT +1 f .

f=

(9)

i=0

where gγi satisﬁes

| RT f, gγi | = α sup | RT f, gγ | .

(10)

γ∈Γ

According to the conclusion [3]: limT →∞ RT f = 0, the signal f can be represented as
T

f=

f, gγi gγi .

(11)

i=0

To compute the correlation between the original signal f and the restored
signal fr with parts of decomposed time-frequency atoms, resemblance coeﬃcient
method [13] is used to the correlation ratio Cr of f and fr .
Cr =

f, fr
.
f · fr

The decaying value dc is a function of the number of iteration T . dc is computed using the following formula.
dc = log10

RT f

.

(13)

where RT f is the residual signal after approximating the original signal f using the ﬁrst T time-frequency atoms [3]. The variable dc is directly related to
convergent speed of TFAD implementation algorithm.

Experiments

To test the validity of the introduced method, a real radar emitter signal is used
to conduct the experiment, in which greedy implementation algorithm (GIA)
[3] is brought into comparison with QGA. Experimental environment is chosen
as: the maximal number of iteration is set to 500 as the termination condition
of TFAD; From our prior tests, c=1.5 is much better than c=2 in [3]; In QGA,
population size N , the number m of binary bits of each variable, the maximal
evolutionary generation g, immigration generation Mg and catastrophe generation Cg are set to 20, 10, 200, 15 and 25, respectively. These experiments are
carried out on the personal computer with 3.06GHz CPU,1GHz EMS memory
and 160GB hard disk. The performances of the two algorithms are evaluated
by using computing eﬃciency and optimization result. Computing eﬃciency includes computing time and the decay performance given in (13). Optimization
result is evaluated by using the correlation ratio of the original signal and approximation signal given in (12). Figure 1 shows the noised radar emitter signal and
its time-frequency distribution. Experimental results are given in Fig.2, Table 2
and Fig.3. The decaying curves of GIA and QGA in Fig.2 show the diﬀerence
between the two algorithms. Figure 3 illustrates time-frequency distributions of
restored radar emitter signals from the decomposed time-frequency atoms. As
can be seen from Fig.2 and Table 2, the introduction of QGA into TFAD shortens greatly the computing time. In Table 2, the computing time of QGA is about
30 times as small as that of GIA. Figure 3 brings us some important hints that
time-frequency distributions constructed by decomposed time-frequency atoms
are nearly identical with that of the original radar emitter signals and TFAD is
a good decomposition approach of a signal. The experimental results manifest
that QGA is a better method than GIA for solving the problem of computing
load in time-frequency atom decomposition.

QGA uses its good characteristics of good global search capability, rapid convergence and short computing time to decrease greatly the computational load
