Abstract. In this paper, we propose a novel fast evolutionary algorithm
— cycle-wise genetic algorithm (CWGA) based on the theoretical analyses of a drug scheduling mathematical model for cancer chemotherapy.
CWGA is more eﬃcient than other existing algorithms to solve the drug
scheduling optimization problem. Moreover, its simulation results match
well with the clinical treatment experience, and can provide much more
drug scheduling policies for a doctor to choose depending on the particular conditions of the patients. CWGA also can be widely used to solve
other kinds of the real dynamic systems.

Introduction

An important target for cancer chemotherapy is to maximally kill tumor cells for
a ﬁxed treatment period. So drug scheduling is essential in cancer chemotherapy.
Martin [7] have proposed the optimal drug scheduling model by the following
diﬀerential equations:
dx1
= −λx1 + k(x2 − β)H(x2 − β)
dt

(1)

dx2
= u − γx2
(2)

with the initial state xT (0) =[ln(100), 0, 0], the parameters λ = 9.9 × 10−4 ,
k = 8.4 × 10−3 , β = 10, γ = 0.27 and:
H(x2 − β) =

where x1 is a transformed variable that is inversely related to the mass of the
tumor. The tumor mass is given by N = 1012 × exp(−x1 ) cells, and the initial

tumor cell population is set at 1010 cells [7]. The variable x2 is the drug concentration in the body in drug units (D) and x3 is the cumulative drug toxicity
in the body. Equation (1) describes the net change in the tumor cell population
per unit time. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Equation (1) describes
the increase in cells due to cell proliferation and the second term describes the
decrease in cells due to the drug. The parameter λ is a positive constant related to the growth speed of the cancer cells, and k is the proportion of tumor
cells killed per unit time per unit drug concentration which is assumed to be a
positive constant. The implication of the function described in Equation (4) is
that there is a threshold drug concentration level, β below which the number
of the killed tumor cells is smaller than the number of the reproduced tumor
cells, and the drug is not eﬃcient. Equation (2) describes the net increase in
the drug concentration at the cancer site. The variable u is the rate of delivery
of the drug, and the half-life of the drug is ln(2)/γ, where γ is the biochemical character parameter of the drug. It is assumed that the drug is delivered
by infusion, and there is an instantaneous mixing of the drug with plasma, as
well as an immediate delivery of the drug to the cancer site. These assumptions
represent approximations based on the relative amount of time. It takes for the
aforementioned activities to occur with respect to the total amount of time over
which the treatment is administered. Equation (3) relates the cumulative drug
toxicity to the drug concentration, e.g., the cumulative eﬀect is the integral of
the drug concentration over the period of exposure.
The performance index [7] to be maximized is:
I = x1 (tf )

(5)

where the ﬁnal time tf = 84 days. The control optimization is performed subject
to constraints on the drug delivery: u ≥ 0, and on the state variables: x2 ≤ 50,
x3 ≤ 2.1 × 103 .
Cancer chemotherapy is a systemic treatment, so the action of the chemotherapeutic agent is not restricted to the tumor site. Any of the body organs are
liable to injury. This is on contrast to the localized treatments, such as surgery
or radiotherapy. Therefore, the constraints on the drug concentration x2 and the
cumulative drug toxicity x3 are to ensure that the patient can tolerate the toxic
side eﬀects of the drug. Drug resistance is considered to be a signiﬁcant factor in
chemotherapeutic failure [8] and it has been shown that the drug resistant cells
are likely to increase as the tumor burden increases [6]. In order to reduce the
likelihood of the emergence of drug resistant cells, the tumor size is forced to reduce by at least 50% every 3 weeks, so that: x1 (21) ≥ ln(200), x1 (42) ≥ ln(400),
x1 (63) ≥ ln(800).
Many researchers have applied diﬀerent optimization methods to improve the
results of the drug scheduling model [1] [3] [4] [6] [7] [8] [10] [11]. Through
analyzing the experimental results from the existing model, there are two obvious
unreasonable outcomes in the optimal drug scheduling policies: (i) unreasonable
timing for the ﬁrst treatment; and (ii) three point constraints cannot improve
the eﬃciency of the cancer treatment. To solve the unreasonable problems and

accurately describe the time course of the cumulative drug toxicity x3 in the
body, in [5], we have modiﬁed the third equation in Martin’s model as follows:
dx3
x3
2θ
= x2 − ηL × x3 (1 − ) − ηG × x3 ln( ) − ηE × x3 ,
(6)
dt
2θ
x3
where ηL , ηG , ηE are nonnegative constants. We set the constraint of the cumulative drug toxicity to x3 < θ.
Equation (6) describes the net change of the cumulative drug toxicity x3 per
unit time. In the right-hand side of this equation, the ﬁrst term x2 describes the
increase of the cumulative drug toxicity x3 due to the drug concentration x2 . The
second, third and fourth terms can be called logistic, Gompertz and exponential
drug toxicity clearance functions respectively, which describe the decreases in
the drug toxicity due to the clearance in the body. As you know, the liver and
kidney are the primary detoxiﬁcation and elimination organs — they eliminate
the drug toxicity from our body. Drugs passing through the liver are eliminated in
a chemically altered (metabolized) form in the bile. Whenever, drug metabolism
or movement across the liver involves an active process, then the likelihood of
saturable kinetics exists. Thus, the logistic and Gompertz functions give the
ﬁt for saturable toxic elimination processes in the liver. On the other hand,
drugs, particularly water-soluble drugs and their metabolites, are also eliminated
by the kidney in urine. The kidney is a ﬁlter that cleanses toxins from our
blood and its ability to excrete the toxic compounds depends on the amount
of the drug toxicity in the bloodstream. Therefore, the renal excretion (i.e.,
ﬁltration and passive reabsorption) may be best considered to the nonsaturable
mechanisms and described by the exponential function. We combine Equation
(6) with Equations (1) and (2) to construct a renewed drug scheduling model.
It matches well with the clinical treatment knowledge and experience.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the optimal
solutions obtained by the renewed drug scheduling model. Section 3 presents
the theoretical analysis of the drug scheduling model. Section 4 describes a fast
evolutionary algorithm — cycle-wise genetic algorithm (CWGA) to solve the
drug scheduling problem. Section 5 provides the simulation results under the new
optimization approach. The paper conclusion and future work are summarized
in Section 6.

Analysis of the Experimental Results of the Renewed
Model

In our previous work, we use our proposed adaptive elitist-population based genetic
algorithm (AEGA), which is an eﬃcient multimodal optimization algorithm [2], to
implement the optimization of the drug scheduling model for exploring multiply
eﬃcient drug scheduling policies. In the drug scheduling problem as described in
Section 1, there are 84 control variables to be optimized, which represent the dosage
levels for the 84 days. The drug scheduling model is a high dimensional and multimodal optimization problem. Here we have proposed a cycle-wise variable representation to accurately and eﬃciently describe the drug scheduling policy.

1102

The cycle-wise variable representation includes two parts: a front and a cyclic
parts. For example, the cycle-wise variable representation is {57.05, 13.5, 0, 10.8,
80 × 21.5} that means giving the drug doses 57.05, 13.5, 0, 10.8 at the ﬁrst four
days respectively, and then repeated 80 times giving the drug dose 21.5 every
two days. Its front part is {57.05, 13.5, 0, 10.8}. Its cyclic part is 80 × 21.5, which
consists of the number of cycles 80 and the repetend 21.5. The cycle-wise variable
representation is very suitable for the drug scheduling problem. Because in the
ﬁrst few days of the treatment period, the patient’s body may not have adapted
to the drug, but it is important to kill as much tumor cells as possible, the drug
doses will be adjusted day by day. We use the front part to represent the drug
doses in this initial period. Then when the patient’s body gradually gets used to
the drug, the drug administration schedule will follow a ﬁxed cycle and a ﬁxed
dose pattern, which is suitably represented by the cycle-part.
Fig.1-(a) and (b) show the multiple optimal solutions, which are explored by
AEGA from our renewed drug scheduling model. We also used other optimization algorithm — iterative dynamic programming (IDP) without the cycle-wise
variable representation [6] to solve the renewed model. The global optimal solution obtained by IDP is as same as Fig.1-(a) shown.

We believe that the cycle-wise variable representation is suitable and consistent with the renewed drug scheduling model. So we do the theoretical analysis
of this model in the next section. The results show that the cycle-wise variable
representation can be used to predict the treatment results of the drug and signiﬁcantly reduce the computational complexity of the optimization algorithm.
Moreover, it is more consistent with the clinical experience.

Theoretical Analysis of the Renewed Drug Scheduling
Model

In the renewed drug scheduling model, Equation (6) is a higher order diﬀerential
equation. We can write it as a system with a very simple change of variable. We
deﬁne the following three new functions.
y1 = ηL × x3 (1 −

x3
)
2θ

(7)

Fast Drug Scheduling Optimization Approach for Cancer Chemotherapy

y2 = ηG × x3 ln(

2θ
)
x3

y3 = ηE × x3

1103

(8)
(9)

Equation (6) can then be wrote the following system of diﬀerential equations.
dyi
= τi × x 2 − yi ,
dt

i = 1, 2, 3

(10)

We combine Equations (1) and (2) with the diﬀerential equations (10) instead
of Equation (6). The renewed drug scheduling model can then be considered as
the ﬁrst order, linear and homogeneous systems of diﬀerential equations.
Theorem 1. In the drug scheduling model, suppose the giving drug doses u is a
cycle-wise variable with a cycle Δt (giving drug at t0 , t0 +Δt, t0 +2Δt,. . . , days),
then the maximal values of the drug concentration x2 and the drug cumulative
toxicity y1 +y2 +y3 are approximately equal in each Δt respectively (e.g., x2 (t0 ) ≈
x2 (t0 + Δt) ≈ x2 (t0 + 2Δt) . . .).
Proof : Suppose giving drug at t0 , t0 + Δt, t0 + 2Δt,. . . , days in the cycle part,
then the drug concentration x2 or the drug cumulative toxicity y1 + y2 + y3 will
meet its constraint at these days. If supposing that x2 meets its constraint, this
means that x2 monotonously increases and reaches its maximal value at times
t0 , t0 + Δt, t0 + 2Δt,. . . , then,
dx2
dx2
dx2
(t0 ) ≈
(t0 + Δt) ≈
(t0 + 2Δt) ≈ 0
dt
dt
dt

(11)

u(t0 ) − λx2 (t0 ) ≈ u(t0 + Δt) − λx2 (t0 + Δt)
≈ u(t0 + 2Δt) − λx2 (t0 + 2Δt)
Since u(t0 ) = u(t0 + Δt) = u(t0 + 2Δt), then
x2 (t0 ) ≈ x2 (t0 + Δt) ≈ x2 (t0 + 2Δt)

(12)

In the same way, we can get the same results of the drug toxicity y1 + y2 + y3 as
the drug concentration x2 .
♦
In the drug scheduling model, there is not the constraint for the number of
cancer cells x1 . In equation (1), x2 must be larger than β for any eﬃcient drug
λx1 . We can evaluate the number of cancer
scheduling policy, then k(x2 − β)
cells at the end of the treatment period using the formula x1 (t0 + k × Δt) =
x1 (t0 ) + k × (x1 (t0 + Δt) − x1 (t0 )). Based on the theoretical analysis of the drug
scheduling model, we can only calculate the values of x1 , x2 and y1 + y2 + y3 in
front part and ﬁrst two cycles of the cycle part, then using them evaluate the
values of x1 , x2 and y1 + y2 + y3 at the end of the treatment period. Thus, the
computational complexity of the algorithm will be signiﬁcantly reduced to solve
the drug scheduling model.

Optimization of Drug Scheduling Model Via CWGA

In this section we propose a new genetic algorithm — a cycle-wise genetic algorithm (CWGA) to implement the optimization of the drug scheduling model for
exploring multiply eﬃcient drug scheduling policies.
In order to successfully explore multiple optimal solutions of the drug scheduling model, several rules for applying the CWGA based on our proposed adaptive
elitist- population search technique [2] are made as follows:
• Use the cycle-wise representation to keep the scheduling freedom and improve
the eﬃciencies of algorithm.
• Use the front part and the ﬁrst two cycles of the cycle-wise representation to
evaluate the ﬁtness of the drug scheduling policy to signiﬁcantly reduce the
computational complexity of the algorithm.
• Use the adaptive elitist-population search technique in the crossover operator
to reduce the redundancy of the population.
• Use the adaptive elitist-population search technique in the mutation operator
to increase the diversity of the population.
• Adaptively adjust the population size to optimally use the elitist individuals
to explore multiple optima.
Following these rules, the CWGA for the drug scheduling model is implemented as follows:
1. Set t = 0 and initialize a chromosome population P (t)
(uniform random initialization within the bounds);
2. Evaluate P (t) using the ﬁtness measure;
3. While (termination condition not satisﬁed) Do
(a) Elitist crossover operation to generate P (t + 1);
i. check the dissimilarity of the randomly selected parents pi and pj ;
ii. if the parents pi and pj are similar, the elitist operation conserves
the better one of them for the next generation; else, according to
multi-point crossover operation, generates 6 oﬀspring, and selects the
better two from the parents and their oﬀspring to the next generation;
(b) Elitist mutation operation to generate P (t + 1);
i. according to the one-point mutation operation, generate the oﬀspring
ci from the parent pi ;
ii. if pi and ci are dissimilar, the elitist operation conserves pi and ci
together for the next generation; else, selects the better one of them
to the next generation;
4. Evaluate P (t + 1);
5. Stop if the termination condition is satisﬁed; otherwise, go to Step 3.

Experimental Results and Comparisons

The drug scheduling problem were simulated using the CWGA with the following
parameters: initial population size=100; maximal number of generations=10000;
crossover rate=1.0; mutation rate=1.0 and the distance threshold σs =10. We set
the parameters ηL = 0.01, ηG = 0.01, ηE = 0.38 in the model. The drug scheduling model was simulated using numerical diﬀerentiation method of Runge-Kutta
[9], with a small time interval of 0.1 day for good accuracy.
Optimizing the renewed drug scheduling model via CWGA for 50 times can
consistently obtain 6 most eﬃcient drug scheduling policies. These results are
listed in Table 1. For example, Fig. 2 and 3 show the control variable u, the
number of cancer cells (inversely related to the best performance index x1 ), the
change processes of the drug concentration x2 and the cumulative drug toxicity
x3 of the ﬁrst and sixth optimal policies. The 6 best results all satisfy the three
point constraints, and therefore it is not necessary to ﬁnd the special solutions
for the new model with the three point constraints separately.

In [5], we use our proposed adaptive elitist-population genetic algorithm
(AEGA) to solve the drug scheduling optimization problem. Comparing with
AEGA, CWGA can explore same multiple optimal solutions for the renewed
model, but its eﬃciency (CPU time) is at least 14 times higher than that of
AEGA because AEGA need to calculate the values of x1 , x2 and x3 under the
diﬀerential equation system in the whole treatment period. We also combine the

ﬁtness measure of CWGA into iterative dynamic programming (IDP) to solve
the renewed drug scheduling problem. IDP can ﬁnd the global optimal solution
and its eﬃciency is improved almost 9 times.
On the other hand, the multiple eﬃcient drug scheduling policies under the
new model match well with the clinical experience. In the clinical treatment, generally the drug scheduling policies include two kinds: continuous and repeated.
The drug scheduling policy (1) and the drug scheduling policies (2)-(6) represent
these two kinds respectively. In some patients, the aim of treatment may be to
reduce the tumor size with minimum toxicity and the drug scheduling policy (6)
is suitable because its cumulative drug toxicity is low and often decreases to 60.
For other patients, they may be cure despite higher toxicity, the drug scheduling
policy (1) is suitable because this policy is most eﬃcient but with high toxicity.
So these multiple eﬃcient drug scheduling policies obtained by the new model
are more useful. According to the diﬀerent conditions of the patients, the doctor
can select the suitable drug scheduling policy to treat a cancer and get the best
eﬃciency.

Conclusion

This paper has presented the novel fast evolutionary algorithm — cycle-wise
genetic algorithm (CWGA) based on the theoretical analyses of a drug scheduling mathematical model for cancer chemotherapy. CWGA is more eﬃcient than
other existing algorithms to solve the drug scheduling optimization problem.
Moreover, its simulation results match well with the clinical treatment experience, and can provide much more drug scheduling policies for a doctor to choose
depending on the particular conditions of the patients. CWGA also can be widely
used to solve other kinds of the real dynamic systems.
