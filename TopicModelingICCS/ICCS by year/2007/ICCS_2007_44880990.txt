Abstract. A nonlinear dynamical system which describes two interacting and competing populations (tumor and immune cells) is studied
through the analysis of the wavelet coeﬃcients. The wavelet coeﬃcients
(also called detail coeﬃcients) are able to reproduce the behaviour of the
function, and, being sensible to local changes, are strictly related to the
diﬀerentiable properties of the function, which cannot be easily derived
from the numerical interpolation. So the main features of the dynamical
system will be given in terms of detail coeﬃcients that are more adapted
to the description of a nonlinear problem.

In this system, which is a generalization of the Lotka-Volterra model, the unknown quantity x(t) represents the numerical density of tumor cells, while y(t)
is the numerical density of lymphocyte population, under conditions x(t) > 0
and y(t) > 0 [6]. Moreover

1. α1 is the rate of growth of the tumor population
2. β1 is the aggressive rate of tumor cells
3. β2 is the stimulatory eﬀect of the tumor cells on immune cells
4. β3 , β4 are, in the average, the immune system response
5. β5 the tumor malignancy
6. ε represents the relative velocity of encounter rates of interacting populations.
Finally γ0 is a parameter related to the ability of recognition of the competing population by the immune system. In particular ε and γ0 are coupling
the macroscopic with microscopic system [4]. Small values of γ0 , according to
[4], correspond to the maximum learning, i.e. full recognition of the competing
population, whereas γ0 = 1 correspond to the minimum learning; the competing
population is not recognized by the immune system.
We investigate the dynamics of this system through the analysis of the wavelet
coeﬃcients which give the possibility to focus on singularities, local high frequencies variation, irregular structure and transient phenomena (see also [2]).
A similar analysis was done in some previous papers [2,3] where we studied the
Van Der Pol equation with and without damping (pointing out stable and stable
solutions), where we observed that if the dynamical system is strongly nonlinear,
the detail coeﬃcients show signiﬁcant jumps. Wavelet coeﬃcients strongly depend on local changes, so that when the dynamical system becomes unstable (or
chaotic) many eﬀects appear [8,9]: the amplitude of the detail coeﬃcients grows,
the detail coeﬃcients gather around some peaks, showing also some randomness
distribution.
The aim of this paper is to investigate these featuring properties of wavelet
coeﬃcients for the above system of equations and to focus on what kind of
wavelet coeﬃcients give more precise information about the behavior of the
studied dynamical system.
The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 some preliminary deﬁnitions about
Haar wavelets and short Haar wavelet transform [1] are given. The Lotka-Volterra
model is introduced in Sect. 3, where we discuss the solutions of the non linear
system through a wavelet analysis.

Without loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to 0 ≤ n , 0 ≤ k ≤ 2n − 1 =⇒

There follows that, the matrix of the wavelet transform is expressed as a direct
sum of lower order matrices so that the short transform is a sparse matrix [1]. We
want to emphasize that when the short wavelet transform maps short interval
values into a few set of wavelet coeﬃcients, it can be considered as a ﬁrst order
approximation. Thus giving information about the linear behavior. However,

since the wavelet transform maps the original signal into uncorrelated sequences
[7], the short wavelet transform describes for each sequence of detail coeﬃcients
its local behavior. When ps = p = N, σ = 1, the above coincides with the
ordinary wavelet transform. We assume, in the following, ps = p = N/σ, s =
0, . . . , σ − 1, (σ > 1).

we obtain the numerical solution as in Fig. 1, where we take, as initial conditions,
an initial high numerical density of tumor cells x(0) = 5 and we neglect the
initial number of lymphocytes y(0) = 0. The other parameters are taken as
γ0 = 1, ε = 0.1 and, according to (5), we simulate a competition where the
rate of growth of the tumor population is little (α1 = 1), the aggressive rate of
tumor cells is neglectable (β1 = 0), the stimulatory eﬀect of the tumor cells on
immune cells is weak (β2 = 0.1), the immune system response is in the average
β3 = 1, β4 = 0.2. Of course with higher values of β4 we will have a stronger
immune system (weaker for smaller values of β4 ).

Fig. 2. Numerical solution (plain x(t), dashed y(t)) of system (1) with parameters
α1 = 1 , β1 = 0 , β2 = 0.1 , β3 = 1 , β4 = 0.2, γ0 = 1 , ε = 0.1, and initial conditions
x(0) = 5, y(0) = 0, in correspondence of diﬀerent values of β5

It can be observed (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) that with small values of the tumor malignancy β5 , the lymphocyte population y(t) grows, whereas tumor cells
x(t) decrease. When β5 > 0.05 the number of lymphocytes reach a maximum
value and then goes to zero while the tumor cell population grows. It should
be noticed that β5 = 0.05 represents a bifurcation point for the model with
loss of uniqueness of the diﬀerential system, because the curve is not simply
connected (for the presence of a knot). When the number of tumor cells tends
to zero the number of lymphocytes decreases to a particular value, called the
sentinel value. The dynamics of equation (5) has been simulated by using the
Runge Kutta 4-th order method, with the accuracy 10−6 . We obtain as a numerical solution (0 < t ≤ 6), in correspondence of the values of the parameter
α1 = 1 , β1 = 0 , β2 = 0.1 , β3 = 1 , β4 = 0.2, γ0 = 1 , ε = 0.1, four sequences
(in correspondence of β5 = 0.01, β5 = 0.04, β5 = 0.05, β5 = 0.06) of 29 = 512
values Y = {Y0 , Y1 , . . . , YN −1 }, with N = 512 and M = 9. Moreover, using
the short Haar wavelet transform, with ps = p = 4, we compare the wavelet
coeﬃcients of the two time-series, near the bifurcation value of β5 , i.e. β5 = 0.05
and β5 = 0.06 computed numerically (Fig. 3, 4).

Critical Analysis

The importance of the wavelet analysis is mainly based on the information content of the detail coeﬃcients. It can be seen (from Fig. 3 and 4) that only a small
set of detail coeﬃcients, namely β00 , β01 , β11 , is already enough to have a good
information about the dynamical system, in any case better than the numerical evaluation (Fig. 3,4 on top). In fact, the detail coeﬃcients show some local

maxima and changes which are hidden in the continuous interpolation of the numerical integration. Each detail coeﬃcient is able, at each scale but mostly at the
lower scale n = 0, β00 , to reproduce the behaviour of the function, but they are
very sensible to local changes and therefore they can easily describe the intervals
where the function is monotonic. Moreover, being sensible to local changes they

996

are strictly related to the diﬀerentiable properties of the function, which cannot
be easily derived from the numerical interpolation of the function. In particular,
we can see that they can focus exactly on local maxima of the function, and
on a number of changes higher than the numerical functions x(t) e y(t). Therefore the detail coeﬃcients are more adapted to the description of a nonlinear
problem but also show a inﬂexion in the initial growth which is invisible in the
numerical solution. These time spots, where the the detail coeﬃcients are zero,
or where the detail coeﬃcients have some local maxima (minima) are reported
in Fig. 3,4, and tell us the inversion (inﬂexion) in the population growth. The
positive values of the detail coeﬃcients describe the local growth, the negative
values the decreasing of the function. Local maxima (minima) of the detail coefﬁcients deﬁne some inﬂexion which enable us to predict if the phenomenon will
increase in time or decrease.
