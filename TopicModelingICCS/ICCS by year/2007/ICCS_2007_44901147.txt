Abstract. The dynamic vehicle routing problem is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization tasks. The interest in this problem
is motivated by its practical relevance as well as by its considerable difﬁculty. We present an approach to search for best routes in dynamic
network. We propose a dynamic route evaluation model for modeling
the responses of vehicles to changing traﬃc information, a modiﬁed Dijkstra’s double bucket algorithm for ﬁnding the real-time shortest paths,
and an improved evolutionary algorithm for searching the best vehicle
routes in dynamic network. The proposed approach has been evaluated
by simulation experiment using DVRPSIM. It has been found that the
proposed approach quite eﬃcient in ﬁnding real-time best vehicle routes
where the customer nodes and network information changes dynamically.

Introduction

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has been largely studied because of the
interest in its applications in logistic and supply-chains management[1,2,3,4,5].
The VRP can be classiﬁed into two categories: static and dynamic [6]. The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) [7,8] is a richer problem compared to
the static ones [9]. It not only involves increasing the problem size as new customer nodes enter the network but also changing in dynamic network, and highly
sensitive to real-time traﬃc information. Most of current heuristic algorithms developed for the DVRP consider static traﬃc information, the travel time between
customer nodes depend on distances only [10,11,12,13]. However, the best path
from any given node to the ﬁnal destination depends not only on the node but
also on the arrival time at that node [14]. Some of the researches have been
concentrated on the development of real-time travel time functions [15,16,17].
In these approaches, traﬃc congestion and random ﬂuctuation of traﬃc ﬂow are
not reﬂected.
The problem considered in this paper is the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem
with Time Window (DVRPTW). We present an approach to search for best
routes in dynamic network. The approach considers route attributes, real-time

traﬃc information and dynamic demand information simultaneously, and can
ﬁnd the best vehicle routes for the DVRPTW.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes the mathematical model of the DVRPTW. Section 3 develops a new route evaluation
model. Using this model, a modiﬁed Dijkstra’s double bucket algorithm is presented. Section 4 designs an improved evolutionary algorithm for the DVRPTW.
Section 5 estimates the value of the developed approach. In Section 6, we discuss
conclusions.

Mathematical Model of the DVRPTW

The DVRPTW is given by a set of vehicles K, a special node called the depot,
a set of customer nodes V , and a network connecting the depot and customers.
For simplicity, we denote depot as customer 0. Since each vehicle has a limited
capacity Qk , and each customer has a demand qi , Qk must be greater than or
equal to the summation of all demands on any route. Any customer i must be
serviced within a pre-deﬁned time window [Tstarti , Tendi ]. Let us assume that
Ti is the arrival time of customer i, Ti,j is the travel time between customer i
and j, αi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is the penalty coeﬃcient, T is the end time period. We
trade oﬀ the vehicle number, travel time, wait cost of vehicles and wait cost of
customers in the objective function of the DVRPTW, which can be formulated
as the following.

Real-Time Shortest Path in Dynamic Network

Dynamic Route Evaluation Model

A number of practical traﬃc information is selected, including real-time traﬃc
information and route attributes, as multiple criteria for the developed dynamic
route evaluation model.
1. Route length: the physical distance of the route.
2. Route width: the number of lanes in the route. The optimal speed of vehicles, Speed optimal , is based on lanes in the route when they travel along this
route.
3. Route diﬃculty: turning movement is selected to measure the route diﬃculty.
4. Actual speed of vehicles on one route:
Speed

actual

=αSpeed optimal α∈[0,1]

Where α is based on route diﬃculty, accident, traﬃc congestion, weather conditions, etc.
We use these multiple criteria to evaluate real-time travel times for each route
in dynamic network, which can be categorized by several criteria. Firstly, it may
be classiﬁed into two types: static and dynamic, according to how it is deﬁned
with respect to time. Secondly, it may be classiﬁed into two types: stochastic
and deterministic, according to whether it is random variables or not. Lastly, it
may also be classiﬁed into two value types: crisp and fuzzy (Table 1).

Real-Time Shortest Path Algorithm

Here, we develop a modiﬁcation of Dijkstra’s double bucket algorithm for path
ﬁnding in dynamic network. In the developed algorithm, the length of a path
is deﬁned to be the travel time on this path. In the problem we considered, a

1150

directed graph is given, G=(V, E), where V represents nodes and E represents
the route between two nodes. For each node v ∈ V , it is assigned a potential
d(v) ≥ 0, where in this case representing the current shortest time to the source
node. For each edge e ∈ E, it is assigned a cost function c(e) ≥ 0, representing
current travel time between two nodes connected by the edge. The length of a
path is now deﬁned to be the summation of the cost of the edges on that path.
There may be impedance on an edge corresponding to some traﬃc limitations,
such as accidents, traﬃc congestion, and weather conditions. So c(e) and d(v)
are time-varying according to real-time traﬃc information in a day. Other variables used by the algorithm are number of nodes, edges, low level buckets and
largest normal travel time along a single edge which are denoted as n, m, B, C
respectively.
The developed algorithm calculates the travel time between nodes when
rerouting request is accepted. The output of the algorithm is the real-time shortest paths between nodes at that time. The time taken by the algorithm on a
graph with n vertices is O(m + n(B + C/B)), and by the standard Dijkstra’s
algorithm, it is O(n2 ). This characteristic is very important for the DVRP.

Improved Evolutionary Algorithm (IEA) for the
DVRPTW
Representation

We use the modiﬁed form of random keys representation [18]. In our representation, a chromosome consists of genes and each gene represents a customer node.
The customer nodes have ﬁxed gene positions in the chromosomes and the order
in which they are visited is determined by sorting on the gene values. The random keys have information about the vehicle number used for a service and the
value for sorting, where the digit before the point represents the vehicle number
and the digit after the point are used as sort keys to decode visiting sequence.
For example, a chromosome to 8 customers problem may be:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
1.324 2.315 2.761 2.189 1.436 1.847 1.875 1.104
The route for the previous chromosome can be represented as follows.
Vehicle1 : 8→1→5→6→7, Vehicle2 : 4→2→3
The steps for generating chromosome are as follows.
1. Generate the vehicle number.
2. Generate sorting number.
3. Combine the vehicle number and sorting number.
4.2

Handling of the Constraints

The initial population of chromosomes is generated randomly and may not satisfy the constraints of the proposed DVRPTW. And some new chromosomes
generated after genetic operators (crossover, mutation) may not satisfy the constraints. So, the constraints-checking steps are executed after new chromosomes

An Improved Evolutionary Algorithm for DVRP

being generated. We consider soft time windows in this paper, so we use the
penalty method. The infeasible chromosomes have fewer opportunities than
the feasible chromosomes, and have the chances to be turned to the feasible
chromosomes by the genetic operator.
4.3

Crossover Operator

We use the two-points crossover operator. It is assumed that there are two chromosomes p1 , p2 as follows and two generated crossover points are 2 and 5.
p1 : 1.324 2.315 2.761 2.189 1.436 1.847 1.875 1.104
p2 : 2.134 1.516 2.385 2.034 1.891 1.625 2.329 1.618
After the crossover operation, two children c1 and c2 are generated as follows.
c1 : 1.324 2.315 2.385 2.034 1.891 1.847 1.875 1.104
c2 : 2.134 1.516 2.761 2.189 1.436 1.625 2.329 1.618
4.4

Mutation Operator

The mutation operator changes the vehicle number with a newly generated vehicle number and does not change the information that is used as sorting key,
because the sequence of the customer nodes can be changed by just changing
the assigned vehicle number of a customer. Let us assume that there are one
chromosomes p1 as follows and the mutation point is 6.
p1 : 1.324 2.315 2.761 2.189 1.436 1.847 1.875 1.104
After the mutation operation, the children c3 is generated as follows.
c3 : 1.324 2.315 2.761 2.189 1.436 2.847 1.875 1.104

Experimental Results and Analysis

In the literature, there is no commonly used benchmark for the DVRPTW,
so the authors have generated their own Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem
SIMulator(DVRPSIM) to evaluate the beneﬁts of the developed approach. The
simulated system of the DVRPTW is made up of three modules, route evaluation
module, shortest path module and routing plan module, as shown in Fig.1.
The main function of route evaluation module is to evaluate the actual travel
times of vehicles on each route using the real-time traﬃc information and the
route attributes, to transmit the result to the shortest path module to determine the real-time shortest path between customers. According to the result
obtained from the shortest path module, routing plan module based on IEA
can determine the best routes for vehicles whenever requested. Vehicles will use
these routes and drive on them in the dynamic network. When the rerouting
requests are accepted, the system will determines the real-time best routes for
vehicles.
In order to compare IEA with other algorithms, we choose two famous algorithms, Branch-Bound algorithm and Clarke-Wright algorithm, as benchmarks.
We listed the comparison results in Table 2.

Conclusions

This paper presents an approach for the DVRPTW. We have proposed a dynamic
route evaluation model to evaluate routes using route attributes and real-time
traﬃc information. We have developed a modiﬁed Dijkstra’s algorithm for ﬁnding
real-time shortest paths in dynamic network. We have designed an improved
evolutionary algorithm for searching the best vehicle routes of the DVRPTW.
We have performed a simulation test using DVRPSIM. In the simulation test, we
have compared three algorithms: IEA, B-B, and C-W. Our primary conclusion
is that the developed approach based on IEA can ﬁnd the best vehicle routes for
the DVRPTW eﬃciently.
