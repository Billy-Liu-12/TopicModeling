Abstract. Conventional finite element procedures with equal order
interpolations for saturated soil dynamic u – p formulation have been
experiencing numerical difficulties for the problems concerning with small
permeability and neglectable compressibility of pore-fluid. Such difficulties can
be avoided by the staggered implicit-implicit algorithm and the direct α method which were introduced by Huang et al. (2004). Several numerical
examples for surface step loadings were given to demonstrate the performance
of the proposed methods. Since the numerical examples for the step loadings
are not typical for dynamic problems, which usually show the relatively strong
oscillation nature of dynamic behaviors. Due to the necessity to show the
effectiveness of the proposed stabilization techniques for cyclic loading
problems, two numerical examples regarding saturated soils subject to a surface
cyclic loading are presented in this paper. Discussion on uniform and nonuniform mesh configuration is also given.
Keywords: Saturated soils; Cyclic loading; u-p formulation; Incompressible

1 Introduction
Extensive research has been devoted during the past few decades to coupled dynamic
analysis of soil - pore fluid interaction problems due to its application to the problems
subjected to earthquake or other types of cyclic loadings. Verification exercises
assisted by the VELACS (VErification of Liquefaction Analysis by Centrifuge
Studies) project of the US National Science Foundation have demonstrated the
importance of the full two-phase, numerical analysis for saturated soil dynamic
problems. The problems are generally formulated in terms of the displacement of the
solid phase u and the pore-water pressure p under certain assumptions [1-2]. The
numerical solution procedure for solving such a u – p formulation with a general
direct implicit time-stepping algorithm was discussed fully in Ref. [3]. It requires that
the interpolation functions for u and p in the finite element discretization must fulfill
the Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the much simpler Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test in
the limit of nearly incompressible pore fluid and small permeability. Only certain
combinations of shape functions for u and p variables are permissible for the mixed

formulation. In particular, when both the permeability and compressibility of the pore
fluid tend to zero, the solution will 'lock' or oscillate wildly unless the displacements
are interpolated from their nodal values by polynomials one order higher than those
used for the pressure. The problem here is identical to that encountered in solid
mechanics or fluid mechanics. The restriction of mixed formulation will complicate
the finite element coding and preclude the use of otherwise useful element types.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce simple stabilization techniques which permit
continuous and equal interpolation to be used for u and p.
Three classes of the stabilization methods have been introduced in the literature so
far. The first of them is referred to as the fractional step method or operator-splitting
method, which can be realized in either semi-explicit form or staggered implicitimplicit form [4-5]. Advantages of the introduction of the staggered implicit-implicit
form over the semi-explicit form are not just its unconditional stability. Meanwhile,
optimal solutions can be achieved with the staggered implicit-implicit form. As
already explained in Ref. [6], the proposed fractional step method (or staggered
algorithm) may experience difficulties due to the time-stepping stability requirement.
Such difficulties can be partially overcome with the introduction of the second class
of the stabilization techniques, which is so-called direct α -method [6]. As an
alternative, Mira et al. [7] presented a new formulation in which stabilization was
achieved through an approach based on the enhanced strain element. However, only
the problems of quasi-static consolidation were discussed in Ref. [7]. Further research
the application of the proposed method into saturated soil dynamic problems is
obviously required. Indeed, the analysis of examples with surface step loadings used
by the authors in Ref. [6] is not quite typical for dynamic problems, since numerical
errors caused by numerical stability problems may be gradually accumulated for the
examples with cyclic loadings. Therefore, in this paper several numerical examples
subjected to cyclic loadings are provided to demonstrate numerical stability of the
previously proposed techniques for dynamic problems.

2 Governing Equations and Stabilized Procedures
Here the staggered implicit-implicit algorithm and the direct α -method proposed by
the authors [5-6] are briefly reviewed. As described in Ref. [6], the governing total
momentum equilibrium and conservation equation of pore-fluid flow for u – p
formulation can be written as
 = 0 .

where u is the vector of displacement, p is the pore-pressure, b is the body force
vector, ρ is the total density of the mixture, ρ f is the density of the fluid, n is the
porosity, k = k /( ρ f g ) , k is the permeability coefficient generally used in soil
mechanics, g is the gravity acceleration, K f is the bulk modulus of the pore fluid.
σ ′ is the vector form of the effective stress defined as σ ′ = σ − m p where σ is the

total stress, ∇ is the gradient operator, S is the strain operator and the vector m in the
2D case take the forms m T = [1 1 0] . The equations have to be supplemented by a
constitutive law for the soil skeleton linking σ′ and the strain ε = Su . For a rateindependent material, it can be expressed as dσ ′ = DT dε .
We now approximate the governing equations in time using the generalized
Newmark scheme[8], i.e. applications of GN22 to the displacement and GN11 to the
pore-pressure. Thus, the total momentum balance equation is written at t = t n+1 as
 n +1 = 0 .
S T [σ′n+1 − m( pnp+1 + p n +1θ Δt )] + ρb n+1 − ρu

where p np+1 =

The staggered algorithm (or operator-splitting method) can

be performed using an intermediate acceleration

. Thus, equation (3) is

approximated with the predicted value S T σ n′ +p1 and can be split into two parts as

Similarly, the conservation equation of pore-fluid flow is written at t = t n +1 as

As already explained in Ref. [6], the optimal elemental values of the splitting factor
δ can be determined by δ = δ ( Δt crit ) 2 (0 < δ ≤ 1.0 , 1 / 2 ≤ δ ≤ 1.0 ), where Δt is the

critical time step length for the direct explicit-implicit algorithm [6].
The so-called direct α -method is referred to as direct modification resulting in
steady state approximation which avoids mixed form restriction. Considering the
presence of the pore pressure variable in first order, the divergence of the time
derivative of the momentum equation should be added to the conservation equation of
pore-fluid flow. The momentum balance equation (1) and its discrete form will
remain unchanged. However, the conservation equation of pore-fluid flow (2) is now
modified by the addition of a proportion α of the divergence of the time derivative of
the momentum balance equation. We write thus

3 Numerical Examples
Several examples were given in Ref. [6] concerning with the solution of transient
problems as well as of the final steady states obtained by the staggered implicitimplicit algorithm and direct α -method. Those were mainly used for modeling elastic
porous media on uniform and non-uniform meshes subjected to a surface step loading.
The space does not permit here the full description of the performance of the proposed
stabilization method in all numerical examples. Due to the significance of the success
of the proposed procedures for the cases with cyclic loading, two numerical examples
are presented here for a soil column and a soil foundation under a surface cyclic
loading.

3.1 Example 1: An Elastic Soil Column Subjected to a Surface Cyclic Loading
First, a simple example is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
stabilization techniques described in Section 2. This is a soil column subjected to a
surface cyclic loading given by q = 1.0 + 0.5 sin( 2.0t ) kPa. Boundary conditions are
sketched in Fig. 1. The material has been assumed isotropically elastic, with the
following properties: E = 2.0 ×10 7 N / m 2 ν = 0.2 , ρ s = 2.0 × 10 3 kg / m 3 , ρ f = 1.0 ×10 3 kg / m 3 ,

, k = 1.0 ×10 −6 m / s and

30 m

k = 1.0 ×10 −4 m / s are considered. For each permeability, five analyses are carried out by
using various algorithms as the following: 1 – direct implicit algorithm, 10 4/4 node
elements; 2 – direct implicit algorithm, 10 8/4 noded elements; 3 – staggered implicitimplicit algorithm, 10 4/4 nodded elements; 4 – direct α -method, 10 4/4 noded
elements; 5 – direct implicit algorithm, 100 8/4 noded elements. Elements with nonuniform interpolation, i.e. biquadratic for u and bilinear for p (8/4 noded elements) are
considered to be acceptable. The computed results obtained using such elements can
be used as the basis of comparison.

It is observed from Fig. 2(a), (b) and (c) that the solutions obtained by using direct
implicit algorithm with equal interpolation (i.e. 4/4 noded element) overestimate the
initial pore-pressure significantly, especially for the cases of low permeability. The
results can be improved when the proposed direct α -method is introduced. As far as
the results of pore-pressure are concerned, the proposed procedure performs even
better than mixed elements with non-uniform interpolation (i.e. 8/4 noded element)
for a mesh composed of 10 elements. In fact, the computational results of porepressure obtained by using the stabilization α -method and the staggered implicitimplicit algorithm agree well with those from 100 8/4 noded elements.
3.2 Example 2: An Elastic Soil Foundation Subjected to a Surface Cyclic
Loading
Next, to further demonstrate the performance of the proposed stabilization methods,
numerical investigations of a real two-dimensional example with uniform and nonuniform meshes are carried out. This is an elastic foundation again with a surface
cyclic loading same as that in example 1. The boundary conditions are sketched in the
Fig. 3(a). The material properties are identical to those in example 1.

3.2.1 Uniform Meshes (Fig. 3b, 3c)
Two uniform meshes used in the analyses consist of 100 or 900 quadrilateral elements
as depicted in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c). Again, three different permeabilities are studied
with comparisons of five different algorithms similar to those already mentioned in
example 1, except 100 elements used for the algorithm Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 900
elements used for the algorithm No. 5. The numerical results obtained by using
various algorithms are shown in Figs. 4(a), (b) and (c). As expected, similar
conclusions can be made with the excellent performance of the proposed stabilization
method.

3.2.2 Non-uniform Mesh (Fig. 5)
As already demonstrated in Ref. [6], the staggered implicit-implicit algorithm with a
global splitting factor δ gives us a significant oscillation for non-uniform mesh since
only global time step can be used for transient problems. The computed results of
pore-pressure can be improved when local splitting factors δ are introduced. The nonuniform mesh used for the analysis is shown in Fig. 5 and it consists of only 4/4

pore-pressure obtained by using three different algorithms (1 – direct implicit
algorithm; 3 – staggered implicit-implicit algorithm with local δ ; 4 – direct α method). Again, the results of pore-pressure can be improved when the proposed
stabilization method is introduced, especially for the cases with low permeabilities.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, two classes of the stabilization methods proposed previously by the
authors for saturated soil dynamics in the limit of nearly incompressible pore-fluid
and small permeability has been briefly reviewed. Attention is then paid to the
performance of the proposed procedures in the problems subjected to cyclic loading,
and two numerical examples have been presented. The numerical results have shown
a good performance of the proposed procedures. It must be pointed out here that the
extension of the stabilized procedures to the elasto-plastic problems is of significantly
importance for practical purpose. Further research in the elasto-plastic analysis with a
more complicated constitutive model based on the concept of bounding-surface
plasticity is currently underway. It must be pointed out that the success in elastoplastic problems is due to not only the introduction of the proposed stabilization
method but also the use of adaptive remeshing or other suitable techniques such as the
assumed strain method, etc. The incompressible-undrained issue can be solved using
the proposed stabilization method with the elements of equal linear interpolation.
However, such elements still behave poorly for the bending dominated problems,
which are important in the calculations involving strain localization. It must be
emphasized that the difficulties remaining for the elasto-plastic problems should not
underestimate the importance in the determination of stabilization parameters.
Optimal elemental parameters can provide the best solutions for the pore-pressure,
which are obviously essential to the success not only in elastic problems but also for
elasto-plastic cases.
