components is explicitly shown.

Introduction

Shannon wavelets are the real part of the so-called harmonic wavelets [2,4,5].
They have a slow decay in the variable space but a very sharp compact support in
the frequency (Fourier) domain, being represented therein by box functions. This
fact, together with the Parseval equality have been used to easily compute the
inner product and the connection coeﬃcients of the Shannon wavelets (see [2,3])
which are the inner product of the Shannon basis with their -order derivatives.
These coeﬃcients, also called reﬁnable integrals, are a very useful tool for the
analysis of discrete samples [7,8] and for the derivation of the wavelet solution
of partial diﬀerential equation (in the Petrov-Galerkin approach) [1,6] In the
following the representation of linear operators in Shannon wavelet bases will
be given. As an example the solution of the heat equation for a localized initial
proﬁle [6] will be obtain as a Shannon wavelet series. The main advantages of this
approach are that: 1) only by using localized functions, like Shannon wavelets,
the initial proﬁle (and then its evolution in time), can be performed by the
lowest number of series coeﬃcients; 2) only with this approach the evolution can
be split into many scales: some for the low frequency evolution and some for the
high frequency evolution 3) the numerical approach is the simplest one.

Shannon Wavelets

The dilated and translated instances of the Shannon scaling functions ϕnk (x) ≡

The family of functions {ψkn (x)} is an orthonormal wavelet basis with respect to
the inner product, deﬁned as

converges to f (x). If we limit the dilation factor n ≤ N < ∞, for a truncated
series, we have the approximation of f (x), given by:

By re-arranging the many terms of the series (15) with respect to the diﬀerent
scales, for a ﬁxed N we have

where fn (x) represent the components of the function f (x) at the scale 0 ≤ n ≤

Let us compute the approximate representation of the even function
f (x) = e−(16x)

(18)

The bottom lenght (i.e. the main part) of the function f (x) is concentrated in
the interval [−0.2, 0.2]. With a low scale n = 3 we can have a good approximation
of the function, even with a small number k of translation. In fact, with |k| ≤ 5
the absolute value of the approximation error is less than 5%. Thus we can
assume

and initial condition (f (x) given by (18))
u(x, 0) = f (x) , −∞ ≤ x ≤ ∞ , t = 0 .

The solution of the problem (21)-(22), in terms of Fourier integrals, is:

(24)

Thus in a short time the high peak (of the initial proﬁle) reduces to a smooth
proﬁle. In the wavelet approach, according to the best scale-dilation approximation of the initial function (18), restricted to the interval [−1, 1], we can assume
that at the resolution n ≤ 3 , |k| ≤ 5, the solution of (21) can be expressed as

as well as for the detail coeﬃcients β, so that the solution can be (numerically)
computed (see Fig. 2). Comparing the approximate wavelet solution (Fig. 2) with
the exact solution (24) (Fig. 1) it substantially coincides with the Fourier solution
(24) even with a low number of scales. However, it should be noticed that (only)
with the ﬁrst approch it is possible to decompose the solution at the diﬀerent
scales (anologously what is done in Fourier series with mode decomposition)
which is impossible to do with the Fourier integral solution (23), (24).
If we limit to the interval [−1, 1] we can see that the evolution of the initial
proﬁle can be split into four diﬀerent waves: f (x) ∼
= f1 (x) , f (x) ∼
=
= f0 (x) , f (x) ∼
f2 (x) , f (x) ∼
= f3 (x) , (corresponding to the four scales n = 0, . . . , 3). The
low frequency wave has a low amplitude but is more steady, while the higher
frequency wave (n = 3) has higher amplitude but a quite fast decay.
