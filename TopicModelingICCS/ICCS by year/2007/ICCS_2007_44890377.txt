Abstract. Thomassen conjectured [8] that every 4-connected line graph
is hamiltonian. An hourglass is a graph isomorphic to K5 − E(C), where
C is a cycle of length 4 in K5 . In [2], it is shown that every 4-connected
line graph without an induced subgraph isomorphic to the hourglass is
hamiltonian connected. In this note, we prove that every 3-connected, essentially 4-connected hourglass-free line graph is hamiltonian connected.
Keywords: Line Graph, Hourglass, Hourglass-Free, Hamiltonian Connected.

Introduction

Graphs considered here are ﬁnite and loopless. Unless otherwise noted, we follow
[1] for notations and terms. A graph G is nontrivial if E(G) = ∅. For a vertex
v of a graph G, dG (v) denotes the degree of v in G and EG (v) denotes the set of
edges incident with v in G. For an integer i > 0, Di (G) = {v ∈ V (G) : dG (v) =
i}.
The line graph of a graph G, denoted by L(G), has E(G) as its vertex set,
where two vertices in L(G) are adjacent if and only if the corresponding edges
in G are adjacent. Thomassen [8] conjectured that every 4-connected line graph
is hamiltonian. This conjecture is still open.
An hourglass is a graph isomorphic to K5 − E(C), where C is a cycle of
length 4 in K5 . A graph is hourglass-free if it does not have an induced subgraph
isomorphic to the hourglass.
Theorem 1.1. (Broersma, Kriesell and Ryj´
a˘cek, [2]) Every 4-connected hourglassfree line graph is hamiltonian connected.

A vertex (edge, respectively) cut X of a connected graph G is essential if G − X
has at least two nontrivial components. A graph G is essentially k-connected
(essentially k-edge-connected, respectively) if G does not have an essential vertex
cut (essential edge cut, respectively) X with |X| < k. In this note, we shall
improve Theorem 1.1 in the following form.
Theorem 1.2. Every 3-connected, essentially 4-connected hourglass-free line
graph is hamiltonian connected.
Since adding edges will not decrease the connectivity and the essential connectivity, applying the line graph closure of Ryj´
a˘cek [6], Theorem 1.2 has the following
corollary.
Corollary 1.3. Every 3-connected, essentially 4-connected, claw-free graph without hourglass is hamiltonian.

Mechanism

Let G be a graph. An edge e ∈ E(G) is subdivided when it is replaced by a path
of length 2 whose internal vertex, denoted by v(e), has degree 2 in the resulting
graph. This process is called subdividing e. For a graph G with e , e ∈ E(G),
let G(e ) denote the graph obtained from G by subdividing e , and let G(e , e )
denote the graph obtained from G by subdividing both e and e . Then,
V (G(e , e )) − V (G) = {v(e ), v(e )}.
For vertices u, v ∈ V (G), an (u, v)-trail is a trail that starts with u and ends
with v.
Theorem 2.1. ([4]) If G is essentially 4-edge-connected such that for every vertex v ∈ V (G) of degree 3, G has a cycle of length at most 3 containing v, then
for every pair of edges e , e ∈ E(G), G(e , e ) has a spanning (v(e ), v(e ))-trail.
Let G be a graph such that κ(L(G)) ≥ 3 and L(G) is not complete. The core of
this graph G, denoted by G0 , is obtained from G − D1 (G) by contracting exactly
one edge xy or yz for each path xyz in G with dG (y) = 2.
Lemma 2.2. ([5], [7]) Let G be a connected nontrivial graph such that κ(L(G)) ≥
3, and let G0 denote the core of G. If ∀e , e ∈ E(G0 ), G(e , e ) has a spanning
(v(e ), v(e ))-trail, then L(G) is hamiltonian connected.

Proof of Theorem 1.2

Let G0 be the core of G. Then as κ(L(G)) ≥ 3, κ (G0 ) ≥ 3. Let X be an essential
edge cut of G0 . Suppose that |X| ≤ 3. If one side of G0 − X has only one edge,
then by δ(G0 ) ≥ 3, we must have |X| ≥ 4, a contradiction. Therefore, both

sides of G − X must have a pair of adjacent edges, and so X corresponds to an
essential vertex cut of L(G). Since L(G) is assumed to be essentially 4-connected,
|X| ≥ 4, a contradiction. Thus we proved the claim:
(3.1) G0 is essentially 4-edge-connected.

We shall prove the next claim:
(3.2) ∀v ∈ D3 (G0 ), G0 has a cycle of length at most 3 intersecting EG0 (v).
By contradiction. Let v ∈ D3 (G0 ) with EG0 (v) = {e1 , e2 , e3 } such that no
edge in EG0 (v) lies in a cycle of length at most 3. Let v1 , v2 , v3 denote the
vertices of G0 adjacent to v such that ei = vvi , (1 ≤ i ≤ 3). Since δ(G0 ) ≥ 3, we
can assume that {f1 , f2 } ⊆ EG0 (v3 ) − {e3 } (see Figure 1(a)). By the deﬁnition
of a core, either e3 ∈ E(G) or e3 is a new edge replacing a path of length 2 in G
(see Figure 2).

Fig. 2. The edge cut {e1 , e2 , e3 } in G

If e3 ∈ E(G), and if neither e1 nor e2 is adjacent to f1 or f2 (see Figure 1(a)
and (b)), then L(G) would have an induced hourglass, contrary to the assumption that L(G) is hourglass-free. Hence we may assume that e1 f1 ∈ E(L(G))
(see Figure 1(c)). Then f1 ∈ EG0 (v1 ), and so G0 [{e1 , e3 , f1 }] ∼
= K3 , contrary to
the choice of v.
By symmetry, we may assume that ∀i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, ei is a new edge which
replaces a path with edges {ei , ei } in G, where we also use ei to denote the
edge adjacent to v in G. Then {e1 , e2 , e3 } corresponds to an essential vertex

cut of L(G) (see Figure 2), contrary to the assumption that L(G) is essentially
4-connected. This proves Claim (3.2).
By (3.1), (3.2) and by Theorem 2.1, ∀e , e ∈ E(G0 ), G0 (e , e ) has a spanning
(v(e ), v(e ))-trail, and so by Lemma 2.2, L(G) is hamiltonian connected.
