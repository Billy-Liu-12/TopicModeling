Abstract. The behavior of sand crushing will appear when the confining pressure
is up to a certain value, which results in disappearing of the positive dilatancy of
sand. Adopting a new hardening parameter with the crushing stress, an
elastoplastic constitutive model considering sand crushing is proposed.
Comparing the conventional triaxial compression test results with the model
prediction, it shows that the proposed model can reasonably describe the
dilatancy of sand from positive to negative.
Keywords: Crushing, Elastoplastic model, Hardening, Sand, Dilatancy.

1 Introduction
Many triaxial experiments[1,2] indicate that sand presents crushing at a high confining
stress, which results in positive dilatancy at low confining stress and negative dilatancy
at high confining stress. The peak strength of sand also decreases with the confining
stress increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an elastoplastic constitutive
model to describe the mechanical behavior of sand crushing.

2 The Model Considering Sand Crushing
Referencing the work by Sun et al.[3], Nakai[4], Yao and Luo[5], the relationship between
the elastoplastic volumetric strain ε vp (or ε ve ) and the mean stress p under isotropic
consolidation condition could be assumed as Eqs.(1) and (2):
m
m
ε ve = C e ⎡( p pa ) − ( p0 pa ) ⎤

⎣

ε vp = ( C ep − C e ) ⎡( p pa ) − ( p0 pa ) ⎤

where p0 is the initial mean stress, pa is the atmospheric pressure, Cep is the compression
index, Ce is the swelling index and m is a coefficient for sand. There are two examples
shown as Fig.1.

in which Mpt is the stress ratio at characteristic point, Mf the stress ratio at shear failure,
M the stress ratio at critical state, η the stress ratio(η=q/p), pc the crushing stress, n a
material parameter of sand (0<n<1). The parameters of proposed model are M, pc and n.
In the proposed model, the equations of the yield locus and plastic potential are similar
to the modified Cam-clay model’s[8,9] on the p-q plane. Adopt the revised hardening
parameter H with crushing stress pc to replace the plastic volumetric strain ε vp in
Cam-clay model. The yield function is given as

3 Prediction Versus Experiments
The following seven soil parameters used in the proposed model: Ce, Cep, m, M, pc, n
and the poisson coefficient ν, all of which can be determined via TC tests. The
parameters Ce, Cep and m are confirmed at isotropic consolidation conditions as in
Fig.1. The parameters M, pc and n are determined by drained triaxial compression tests
at different initial stresses. The model parameters for Toyoura sand are listed in Tab.1
and the value of atmospheric pressure pa is given as 0.1MPa.

The test results and the predicted relationships between axial strain ε a , radial
strain ε r , volumetric strain ε v and principal stress radio σ a σ r are shown in Fig.2.
Analyzing the prediction results as shown in Fig.2, it can be seen that: The
predicted curves by the proposed model agree well with the test results for Toyoura
sand under conventional triaxial compression conditions except the εa-εv curves at p=4,
8MPa. When the confining stress of sand rises, the strength (peak principal stress
ratio) decreases. When the confining stress of sand rises, the volumetric dilatant
degree of sand decreases.

4 Conclusions
(1)Because of the behavior of sand crushing, the peak principal stress ratio and the
degree of positive dilatancy for conventional triaxial compression tests both decrease
when the confining stress rises. The dilatancy will disappear when the confining stress
is larger than the crushing stress.
(2)The proposed elastoplastic constitutive model, adopting the new hardening
parameter revised by the crushing stress, can reasonably describe the stress-strain
behavior and the dilatancy of sand.
