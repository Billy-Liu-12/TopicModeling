Abstract. In order to make the best use of available energy budget,
we propose a QoS adjustment method which maximizes the total QoSprovisioning of multimedia tasks with uncertain execution time. This
method utilizes the probability distribution of task’s execution time to
determine an instant QoS level. Our experiments show that the proposed
method gives 52% more QoS-provisioning than the conventional method
using a constant QoS level derived from the worst-case time.

Introduction

A necessary feature for the mass computation of multimedia applications on
wireless electronic devices is acceptable battery lifetime. If critical computation
suddenly stops before its completion due to the shortage of available energy, it
may result in great loss. Generally, we can reduce the energy consumption rate
of battery and thus extend the battery’s lifetime by decreasing the computation
amount in a running application. In most cases, however, more computation is
necessary to provide better quality of service(QoS). As a result, there is a demand to control both the computation amount of an application and its battery
lifetime. Another issue to be considered is the uncertain execution time of multimedia applications. Their execution time heavily depends on their input data,
but the information of input data is not available before starting execution.
In this paper, we propose an energy-aware QoS adjustment of multimedia
tasks with uncertain execution time, which guarantees their worst-case execution
time and maximizes the total QoS-provisioning gained from performing their
computation in limited-energy environments. The proposed method assigns the
highest QoS level to the earliest processing part of a task and decreases the QoS
level gradually as the task progresses its execution. Even though the later running
parts provide lower QoS level when being executed, they are rarely performed due
to their lower probability. Statistically, this can support more QoS-provisioning
than assigning a constant QoS level derived from the assumption that the task
is always executed for the worst-case execution time.

Graceful degradation [1] or stopping the unimportant task [2] can allow
mission-critical tasks to run for a longer period of time when available energy is
low. These methods considered the energy management of tasks with ﬁxed execution time but not that with uncertain execution time. Lee et al. [3] addressed
a similar method to maximize QoS-provisioning while using the limited amount
of energy. They proposed a general approach, however, there is no relationship
between QoS and energy consumption.

Preliminaries

The notion of QoS in multimedia tasks includes various characteristics such as
resolution, delay, jitter, loss rate, etc. Among several properties of QoS, the
amount of data computed by a task is referred to as ﬁdelity. For example, the
display size of a video player or the amount of lossy compression applied to
a video stream can be the ﬁdelity of the video streaming task. Experimental
results [1,4] showed that the energy consumption of a multimedia task is proportional to its ﬁdelity such as the image size being processed, the transmission
rate on wireless networks, and its running time.

The systems can be designed for scheduling multimedia tasks with their worstcase execution times, resulting in signiﬁcant waste of energy. Approaches based
on the average case are likely to suﬀer from lacking resource, particularly in
the worst case. More accurate models are based on the probability distribution
of execution times. Figure 1(a) shows an example of probability distribution of
task’s execution times and Figure 1(b) shows the tail distribution of its cumulative probability distribution, denoted as Pt at a time t. Pt is the probability
that the task continues its execution for at least time t.

Proposed Method

In this paper, we study how to maximize the ﬁdelity beneﬁt of a single multimedia task with uncertain execution time on a limited-energy system. It is assumed

that the other tasks running on the system have nearly ﬁxed execution times
and their operations are stable in most cases. Then, we can formulate the total
energy consumption amount of all tasks as follows:
Tw
0

m · F(t) · dt + b · Tw

where Tw is the worst-case execution time, m and b are an application-speciﬁc
coeﬃcient associated with the multimedia task and a constant coeﬃcient associated with background tasks respectively, and F (t) is the instantaneous ﬁdelity
of the multimedia task at a time t. When Emax denotes the amount of available
T
energy budget, 0 w m · F(t) · dt + b · Tw ≤ Emax . For simplicity, we deﬁne Bmax
Tw
as 0 F (t) · dt ≤ Emaxm−Tw ·b = Bmax .
As a beneﬁt measure of ﬁdelity, we deﬁne Perceptional Resolution of a task as
the resolution of 2-dimensional images computed by the task. User perception
against 2-dimensional images is proportional to the square root of their sizes.
The problem dealt with in this paper is to maximize the total Perceptional
Resolution of a task during its execution, subject to the constraint that the
amount of total energy consumption during its execution is no larger than the
given energy budget. The problem can be formulated as follows:
Tw

(F (t)/Pt2 ) · Pt2 · dt ≤ Bmax .

By Jensen’s inequality [5], this maximization occurs when all values of F (t)/Pt2
are the same. Then Equation (1) has an upper bound as follows:

Since Pt always decreases as t increases, a task decelerates its ﬁdelity as its
execution goes on in the optimal schedule. The previous work [1,6] showed that
the overhead to dynamically decelerate ﬁdelity is negligible. This approach can
be applicable to similar problems which try to maximize or minimize another
metric of QoS, instead of Perceptional Resolution.

Evaluation

The proposed method determines an instant QoS level based on the distribution
of task’s execution times while the conventional method determines a constant
QoS level based on the worst-case execution time. For evaluation metric, we

deﬁne QoS Increment as Pp Sw w × 100, where P Sp and P Sw are the total Perceptional Resolutions in the proposed method and in the conventional method,

respectively. We implement the proposed method and the conventional method
on a practical multimedia application and compare their performance. In these
experiments, we consider the case that a user enjoys watching a live broadcasting of the 2006 Major League Baseball(MLB) on a mobile device with limited
energy budget. Figure 2(a) shows the playing time distribution of the former
83 games and the latter 83 games in the 2006 season of the New York Yankees team [7]. Figure 2(b) shows the average performance of the latter 83 games
when they utilizes the proposed method based on the distribution information
of the former 83 games. The longest playing time of MLB (i.e., 486 minutes) is
used for the worst-case playing time. These experiments show that the proposed
method provides 52% QoS Increment when Tw is 486 minutes. As the value of
Tw is decreased, its performance goes down but the risk to irresistibly stop the
broadcasting in the middle of games is also increased.
