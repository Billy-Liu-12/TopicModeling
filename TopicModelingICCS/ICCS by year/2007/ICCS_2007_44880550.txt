Abstract. Local spatial interaction (i.e. neighborhood interaction) between
land-use types is an important component in Cellular Automata -based urban
geosimulation models. Herein a new method based on the integration of Tobler’s
First Law of Geography with Reilly’s gravity model and coupled with logistical
regression approach is proposed to model and calibrate the neighborhood
interaction. This method is embedded into a constrained CA model to simulate
the spatial process of urban growth in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The results
indicate that this method captures the main characteristics of neighborhood
interactions in the spatial process of urban growth. Further, this method provides
an alternative and extensive approach to present local spatial interactions for
“bottom-up” urban models.
Keywords: Geosimulation, cellular automata, urban growth, GIS.

1 Introduction
One of the most important developments in Geographic Information Science
(GIScience) is the expansion of theories, models, and technologies to effectively
discern and interpret spatiotemporal patterns, relationships, and interactions among
features, activities, processes, and events in geographic domains. In current era, as
rapid changes of urban land-use all over the world have greatly impacted on local [1-3]
and global environmental changes [4, 5], the issue of modeling the spatial process of
urban growth to better understand the mechanism and consequences of urbanization
and explore the extent of future urban land-use change has attracted sweeping
attentions of scientists with background in different disciplines ranging from
anthropology to mathematical programming. This issue also has enriched the theory
and technology of simulation model of geographic phenomena.
An important component in Cellular Automata (CA)-based urban geosimulation
models is the local spatial interaction between neighborhood land-use types. The
neighborhood interaction is often addressed based on the notion that urban

development can be conceived as a self-organizing system in which natural constraints
and institutional controls (land-use policies) temper the way in which local
decision-making processes produce macroscopic urban form. Different processes can
explain the importance of neighborhood interaction. At large scale, simple mechanisms
for economic interaction between locations were provided by the central place theory
[6] that describes the uniform pattern of towns and cities in space as a function of the
distance that consumers in the surrounding region travel to the nearest facilities. Spatial
interaction between the location of facilities, residential areas and industries has been
given more attention in the work of Krugman [7, 8]. The spatial interaction is explained
by a number of factors that either cause concentration of urban functions (centripetal
forces: economies of scale, localized knowledge spill-over, thick labor markets) and
others that lead to a spatial spread of urban functions (centrifugal forces: congestion,
land rents, factor immobility etc.).
In keeping with the spirit of simplicity, neighborhood interaction in the application
of CA on urban geosimulation models most often adopt either the Von Neumann 3×3
(or 5×5) or the Moore 3×3 neighborhood [9-11]. For most physical systems, these are
clearly the most appropriate definitions since such systems typically have only local
causation. However, in the case of human systems like cities, the idea of locality may
be much larger, since people and institutions are aware of their surroundings in a wider
space [12]. Thus it is desirable to define a neighborhood large enough (i.e. extended
neighborhood) to capture the operational range of the local processes being modeled by
CA. White and Engelen (1993) firstly proposed this kind of configuration of
neighborhood for exploring the relationship of CA-based model of urban form
evolution [13]. In 1997, White et al. calibrated the neighborhood effect by means of a
trial and error approach for geosimulation of Cincinnati city [14]. In 2004, this research
group proposed automatic calibration procedure for this kind of neighborhood effect
[15].
The objective of this study is to improve the methodology of existing CA models by
proposing a theoretical framework to model and calibrate the neighborhood effect. This
framework aims to assist modelers in the implementation and quantification of
neighborhood interaction in urban geosimulation models.

2 Modeling Neighborhood Interaction
Tobler’s First Law of Geography (FLG), “Everything is related to everything else, but
near things are more related than distant things”, is the fundamental theory in this
framework. This law, firstly proposed in 1970 [16], has brought strong controversy in
geography domain. In 2003, a panel on this law was organized in AAG meeting in New
Orleans. Five famous geographers presented their comments in this panel and these
comments were published in a forum of Annals of the Association of American
Geographers in 2004. Some professors agreed with Tobler, others not. However, all of
them accepted the actual geography phenomena illustrated by the FLG. The
divarication existed on the word “law”. Goodchild especially discussed the validity and
usefulness of the FLG in GIScience and geography [17]. Here, the controversy of
whether phenomena can be expressed as “law” was discarded, and the local knowledge
expressed in Tobler’s FLG was accepted. It is assumed that the effect of cell states in

552

Y. Zhao and Y. Murayama

the neighborhood area of developable cell accord with the rule of distance decay
described in the FLG.
The expression of Tobler’s FLG is very qualitative, and a distance decay function is
needed for representing the law. Herein the idea of Reilly’s law of retail gravitation
[18] was adopted, which states that ‘A city will attract retail trade from a town in its
surrounding territory, in direct proportion to the population size of the city and in
inverse proportion to the square of the distance from the city’. Fig. 1 shows one of the
extended neighborhood patterns of one developable cell i, which is defined as all cells
within a radius of eight cells, an area containing 196 cells. It is assumed that in cellular
environment all the cells in the neighborhood contribute to the conversion of
developable cell i. The contribution of one cell is associated with the state of itself and
the distance to the developable cell i. It can be express as follows:
f kh = Gkh

Aj .
d 2ji

(1)

Where,
fkh: constribution of one cell j with land-use k in the neighborhood to the conversion
of the developable cell i to land-use h for next stage,
Aj: area of the cell j,
dji: the Euclidean distance between the cell j in the neighborhood area and the
developable cell i, and
Gkh: constant of the effect of land-use k on the transition to land-use h. + stands for
positive, – repulsive.
Fig.2 indicates the scheme of the impact gradient using this function. Notice that this
is a modificatory Reilly’s function and no unit problem exist in this function.
Then the aggregated effect of the cells in the neighborhood can be expressed as:

Fkh = Gkh ∑

Where,
m: total number of the cells in the neighborhood, and
Ikj: index of cells. Ikj=1, if the state of cell j is equal to k; Ikj=0, otherwise.
For one land-use type of one cell, there are just two results of transition: change or no
change. Therefore, logical regression approach was selected to calculate the
probabilities of the transition of cell i under neighborhood effect. The contribution of
neighborhood effect to the probability of conversion to land-use h of a cell (Ni) is
described as a function of a set of aggregated effect of different land-use types:
Log (

Where, β'oi and β'ikh are the coefficients which should be calibrated.

3 Calibration of Neighborhood Interaction
3.1 Study Area and Data Set
The Tokyo metropolitan area was identified as study area to confirm the approach as
this area possesses abundant dataset of land-use. The dataset is named “Detailed Digital
Information (10m grid land-use) Metropolitan Area” of Tokyo which was released in
1998 by Geographic Survey Institute of Japan. The data in 1984 and 1989 was used to
calibrate the neighborhood effect.
The dataset was designed 10 cell states of land-use and was aggregated into
100×100m grid from 10×10m in majority rule. Land-use of water represents fixed
features in the model, that is, this feature are assumed not to change and which
therefore do not participate in the dynamics in order to protect the life environment.
Two types of land-use of forest & wasteland, and cropland take passive features that
participate in the land-use dynamics. However, the dynamics are not driven by an
exogenous demand for land. They appear or disappear in response to land being taken
or abandoned by the active functions. The active functions are four land-use categories
which are forced by exogenously generated demands for land to CA in response to the
growth of the urbanized area: vacant, industrial, residential, and commercial land.
Other three types of land-use of road, public land, and special land show passively
active features which are dynamics in the model. Active and passively active types of
land-use are assumed to participate in the neighborhood interaction.
3.2 Calibration of the Neighborhood Interaction
As one of statistical analysis techniques, logistical regression has to consider the
problem of spatial statistics like spatial dependence and spatial sampling [19, 20] in the

554

Y. Zhao and Y. Murayama

calibration procedure. The integration of both systematic and random sampling method
was adopted to eliminate spatial dependence effect. Firstly, land-use changes were
detected from the data set in 1984 and 1989. Systematic sampling was implemented
and approximately half cells of the changes of every one of four active land-use types
were remained. Then random selection of not changed cells was carried out to create
nearly 1:1 ratio for changed cells and not changed cells. Its total size was 27, 070 cells.
The result of calibration is shown in Table 1.

Table 1 illustrates that all the values of PCP of four active land-use types are more
than 80% and all of the values of ROC more than 0.9, thus showing goodness of fit of
this approach. The results of the test also indicate the existence of neighborhood
interaction in urban land-use changes.

4 Simulation and Results
Constrained CA model was put forward to confirm this method. In this model,
transition potentials for each cell are calculated as follows:
t

Pik = (1+ t −1N ik )(1+t −1Sik )(1+t −1Z ik )(1+ t −1Aik )t −1v .

(5)

Where, tPik = the potential of the cell i for land use k in time t; t-1Nik = the neighborhood
effect on the cell i for land-use k at time t-1, which equals the value of Nih in equation 4;
t-1
Sik = the intrinsic suitability of the cell i for land-use k at time t-1; t-1Zik = the zoning
status of the cell i for land-use k at time t-1; t-1Aik the accessibility of the cell i to
transportation for land-use k at time t-1; t-1v is the scalable random perturbation term at
time t-1. Four active land-use types were changed by an intervention that is exogenous
to the CA model from regional systems.

In this schema the neighborhood factor N makes city works like a non-linear system
as suitability, accessibility and land-use zoning status are relatively stable in certain
period.
In a learning stage, t-1Sik, t-1Zik, and t-1Aik also were calibrated through the dataset in
1984 and 1989. The calibrated model was used to simulate the spatial process of urban
growth of the Tokyo metropolitan area from 1989 to 1994. Land-use maps in
simulation and reality are shown in Fig. 3. Note that in order to make the maps clearer,
land-use types of forest & wasteland and cropland have been grouped into
non-urbanized area and other land-use types except water into urbanized area.
A good CA-based model produces results which have all the patterned complexity of
the real system [12]. Comparison of the simulated result with the actual data in terms of
fractal dimension and spatial metrics was carried out towards the test of this proposed
approach. These two indices are excellent for presenting the pattern of complex system
like city [21]. Table 2 shows the assessment result of the simulated urbanized area in
terms of fractal dimension. Areas, the distance from which to Tokyo station is more
than 50km, were omitted considering the effect of boundary in this table. In order to
understand the change of urbanized area structure and confirm the ability of this model
in capturing the change of structure, fractal dimension of urbanized area in 1989 also is
shown. Table 2 indicates that urbanized area shows bifractal structure in the study area.
Urbanized area had grown more greatly in the second radius zone with 16-50km than in
the first one with 0-16km. Model well captures this characteristic.
Fig.4 shows the assessment result of simulation in terms of spatial metrics. Two
metrics were used for the assessment: NP (number of patches) and PD (patch density).
Values of NP and PD had declined from 1989 to 1994, thus indicating the
characteristics of compact growth or conglomeration of the existing urbanized area in
the study area. Simulated urbanized area presents the same characteristics. However, if
we take out the component of neighborhood interaction from the model, NP and PD
turgidly increased. This confirms the utility of the proposed approach in modeling
neighborhood interaction.

5 Concluding Remarks
This study developed a novel approach for modeling and calibrating neighborhood
interaction in CA-based urban geosimulation. The proposed method provides a
theoretical framework for presenting neighborhood effect of CA. The results of
simulation using the Tokyo metropolitan area as a case study indicates that urban
geosimulation model which embeds this method well captures the main characteristics
of spatial process of urban growth. The results also confirmed the utility of this method
for presenting dynamics of complex system.
This approach can be used not only in regular grid cells, but also in irregular cells,
like in vector structure, as it considers the area of cells and the distance decay. To
discuss this issue would be a value extension to the current study.
