Abstract. Geometries of ground states of mer-tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)metal (Mq3, M=Al3+, Ga3+, In3+, Tl3+) are optimized by B3LYP/6-31G(d)
methods. The bonding interactions between the metal fragment Mq2 and each
single ligand q have been analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme. The
calculated results suggest that the HOMO and LUMO distribution fashion can
be simply traced back to the lowest electrostatic attractive and highest orbital
interaction energy between fragments A-quinolate ligand and Mq2 and B-ligand
and Mq2, respectively.
Keywords: energy partitioning analysis, Mq3, FMO distribution fashion.

1 Introduction
Tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum, Alq3, is the mile stone for the development of
organic light-emitting diode (OLED), which was used in the first OLED [1]. The
majority of the molecular properties of metaloquinolate work carried out thus far has
been on the ground-state (S0) [2-5] and first excited state (S1) [6,7] characteristics of
Alq3. Mq3 has two geometric isomers, the facial (fac-Mq3) and meridianal (merMq3) forms, respectively. The energy partitioning analyses (EPA) method has
recently been used in systematic investigations of the nature of the chemical bond in
main-group and transition metal compounds [8]. In order to explore the difference of
individual ligands from chemical bond point of view, energy partitioning method has
been applied to the series of complexes mer-Mq3 as shown in Fig. 1, as a series study
of our previous works [9,10].

2 Methodology
The calculations for mer-Mq3 (Fig. 1) described here were carried out by the same
methods as described previously [9,10]. The structure of mer-Mq3 in S0 state was
optimized using the B3LYP functional with 6-31G(d) basis set for C, H, O, N, Al(III)
Ga(III) and Stuttgart RLC ECP for In(III) and Tl(III), respectively. In order to explore
the difference of individual ligands from chemical bond point of view, EPA was
applied to the series of complexes.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 The Optimized Structure Analyses of S0 for mer-Mq3
The optimized structures for these complexes are listed in Table 1 (the results for Al
and Ga complexes see our previous results [9]). For each complex, the bond lengths
for O-M in ligand A are shorter than those in ligands B and C. The bond lengths of OM are shorter than those of N-M and increase with their atomic numbers as O-Al < OGa < O-In < O-Tl. The bond angles of O-M-O and N-M-N decrease with their atomic
numbers as O(N)-Al-O(N) > O(N)-Ga-O(N) > O(N)-In-O(N) > O(N)-Tl-O(N).

3.2 The Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMO) Analyses of S0 for mer-Mq3
The FMO plots of mer-Mq3 are shown in Figure 2 (the results for Al and Ga
complexes see our previous results [9]). For each complex, the HOMO is mainly
localized on one ligand (labeled A), while the two others are predominantly localized
on the other ligands (C and B respectively for HOMO-1 and HOMO-2). The most
low-lying unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is found to be mainly localized on

ligand B the two others (LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) being mainly localized on other
two ligands (C and A), respectively, for Alq3 and Tlq3, while almost uniformly
localized on the same other two ligands (C and A) for Gaq3 and Inq3.

The results given in Table 2 show the same tendency for all investigated
complexes. The interaction energy ΔEint between the two fragments increases in the
sequence as Alq2-qL < Gaq2-qL < Inq2-qL < Tlq2-qL. Moreover, the larger ΔEelstat%
(59.72-65.18%) over ΔEorb% (34.82-40.28%) suggests that metal-ligand interactions
have a larger electrostatic character than covalent character. For each complex, the

electrostatic interaction energy (ΔEelstat) between qA and MqBqC fragments is weaker
than those of qB-MqAqC and qC-MqAqB, which may results in the HOMOs localizing
on A-ring for S0 states. The orbital interaction term, ΔEorb, between qB and MqAqC
fragments is higher than those of qA-MqBqC and qC-MqAqB, which may correspond to
the localization of LUMOs on B-ligands.

4 Conclusions
The same HOMO and LUMO distribution fashion for mer-Mq3 system can be simply
traced back to the lowest electrostatic attractive and highest orbital interaction energy
between fragments A-quinolate ligand and Mq2 and B-ligand and Mq2, respectively.
Our results suggest that EPA may be a powerful approach to rationalize the
distribution patterns of HOMO and LUMO for complexes consisting of metal ion and
three same component ligands with C1 symmetry.
