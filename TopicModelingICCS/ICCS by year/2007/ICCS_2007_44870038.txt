Abstract. A numerical model has been developed for the simulation long wave
propagation and run-up accounting for the bottom friction. Shallow water
continuity and momentum equations are solved numerically by a two time step
finite difference method. The upwind/downwind method is applied to the
nonlinear advection terms and the continuity equation. Effects of damping and
bottom friction on the computations are investigated. Since the equations lose
their validity when waves break, wave breaking has been checked at every step
of the computations. A point can be either wet or dry at different time levels. A
moving boundary description and staggered grid are used to overcome the
difficulty of determining wet and dry points. Equations are solved by the finite
difference approximations of second and third order accuracy. Furthermore,
space filters are applied to prevent parasitic short wave oscillations.
Keywords: Finite difference, long wave, run-up, moving boundary, filters.

1 Introduction
Nonbreaking long waves induced by tsunami, tide or storm cause catastrophic
damages on the coasts because of high run-up levels. The numerical simulation of
long wave propagation is an important tool in the damage control of catastrophic long
waves. Estimation of the boundary between wet and dry points is a difficult problem
in the simulation of wave run-up. During the simulations a computational point can be
either wet or dry at different time levels. Therefore a moving boundary description is
necessary.
Two dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations including bed shear stress
were numerically solved by some researchers [1],[2]. Lynett et al. (2002) proposed a
moving boundary technique to calculate wave run-up and run-down with depthintegrated equations [3]. An eddy viscosity model was inserted in the numerical
model to account breaking phenomena. Kanoglu (2004) focused on initial value
problem of the nonlinear evolution and run-up and run-down of long waves on
sloping beaches for different initial wave forms [4]. Shermeneva and Shugan (2006)
calculated the run-up of long gravity waves on a sloping beach using a high-order
Boussinesq model [5]. Wei et al. (2006) simulated the long wave run-up under
nonbreaking and breaking conditions with two dimensional well-balanced finite
volume methods [6].

In this study, nonlinear long wave equations have been solved numerically to
simulate the wave run-up by upwind-downwind method. The effects wave breaking,
wetting-drying of boundary points, friction and nonlinear terms on wave run-up, have
been investigated.

where, u, r, D, H, η are horizontal velocity, bed friction factor, total depth, water
depth and water elevation above still water level, respectively. Total depth is the sum
of water depth and water elevation above the still water level.
Two-time level numerical scheme has been used for the solution of the system.
Upwind/downwind method has been applied to the nonlinear (advective) terms. The
following algorithm is used to check the wet and dry points. Total depth has a positive
value at a wet point and it is zero on the boundary[7].

When waves break, the continuity equation and equation of motion lose their validity.
To check the breaking, a dimensionless parameter Br is used [9].

Br =

where, η0 is the initial wave amplitude, w is angular frequency, g is gravitational
acceleration, α is bottom slope. If Br<1, nonbreaking waves occur, otherwise the waves
break while climbing up the sloping beach [2].

3 Applications of the Model
A sinusodial wave is assumed to enter from the left side of the channel with a water
elevation function given below,

⎛ 2Π t ⎞
⎟
⎜ Tp ⎟
⎝
⎠

η =η 0 sin ⎜

(10)

where Tp is the wave period.
The application channel has a length of 2km. The bottom slope is linear. The
water depth of the channel begins with 10 m at the left side of the channel and ends
with -10m at the right side. Wave period is 1000 sec. The positive value of the depth
descibes a wet region in the run-up computations. The horizontal grid size is 5m in
the propagation direction and the time step is 0.5 sec. [10].

Computations begin with describing a sinusodial signal at the left side of the
channel. Then, the total depth is computed at each time level related according to the
changes of water level with time. The boundary is described with jm index. If the
water level at point jm, is greater than the water depth, then, the point jm+1 is
considered in the calculations. After this control, velocity is calculated. Velocity at
point jm+1 is determined with the linear extrapolation and a similar approach is applied
to the water elevation computation.
Computed water level changes at different levels of wave run-up and run- down is
shown in Fig. 2. Bottom friction is neglected in this application. Curves 1 and 2 are
the initial wave run-up curves, and curves 3 and 4 are the curves of wave run-down.
Curve 5 shows the initiation of run- up of the second wave.

In the second application, bottom friction, nonlinear terms and damping effects are
included in the computations while simulating the wave propagation along a channel
with a positive slope. The length of the channel is 100km. Water depth varies linearly
from 50m to 5m. Long wave propagates from deep water to shallow water with a
wave period of Tp=5 min. The time step is 0.1sec and the grid size is 25m. Simulated
wave amplitude and velocity distributions throughout the channel are given in Fig.3.
Distributions of water elevation and velocity show a significant difference. Wave
amplitudes change slightly along the channel, but velocities change significantly as
shown in Fig.3. Damping is more donimant on wave amplitudes compared to
velocities. Strong nonlinear interactions occur in shallow waters and they cause
stability problems. To test whether the waves with small periods appeared at the
beginning and at the end of the main wave are the results of a physical phenemenon

or not, a finer resolution in the spatial domain has been used in the numerical
computations. Therefore grid size is reduced to 5m and the simulated wave amplitude
changes are depicted in Fig. 4. Short wave oscillation decreases as resolution
increases, so it can be concluded that short wave oscillations are the results of coarse
spatial resolution.
The main sources of nonlinear effects are the advective terms. Because of stability
problem, higher order accurate upwind approximations have been applied to first
order derivatives . Three points are used in the solution scheme as;

Higher order spatial approaches are used for the calculations of water elevations.
The mesh point j is the point where velocity uj is calculated. Water elevation is
calculated at Δx/2 distances away from point j at two sides. Higher order equations
are obtained by combining the equations at points located at Δx/2 and 3Δx/2 distances
and considering the second order Taylor series. The new formulation of the first
derivative of water elevation is given below.

A similar approach is used for the spatial derivative of velocity in the continuity
equation. However, water elevation is computed at the midpoint in velocity
computations and therefore spatial index is shifted to the right and point j+1 is
inserted instead of point j in the numerical calculations.

Parasitic short wave oscillations are prevented with the application of higher order
spatial and time resolutions, but application of simple space filters is easier to prevent
the formation of parasitic short waves. Space filters are applied only to the computed
velocities. The filtered new form of velocity is given in the equation (14).

4 Conclusions
Motion and continuity equations of long wave run-up are solved numerically by a two
time level approach. The effects of nonlinear terms, damping, bottom friction and wet/
dry boundaries have been investigated. Application of upwind/downwind approximations

to continuity equation gives stable results at the boundaries of wet and dry regions.
Parasitic short wave oscillations are eliminated by increasing the resolutions in space and
in time. Application of higher order accurate approximations increases the accuracy of
the solution. It is observed that filter technique is a reliable tool for preventing parasitic
short wave oscillations in the solutions obtained with lower order accurate
approximations. The proposed numerical model successfully simulates the long wave
run-up.
