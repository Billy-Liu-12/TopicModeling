Abstract. As a benchmark for measuring market risk, Value-at-Risk
(VaR) reduces the risk associated with any kind of asset to just a number (amount in terms of a currency), which can be well understood by
regulators, board members, and other interested parties. This paper employs a new kind of VaR approach due to Engle and Manganelli [4] to
forecasting oil price risk. In doing so, we provide two original contributions: introducing a new exponentially weighted moving average CAViaR
model and developing a least squares regression model for multi-period
VaR prediction.
Keywords: CAViaR, oil price risk, exponentially weighted moving
average.

Introduction

Because of the key role of oil in the economies throughout the world, predicting
the future price of this commodity and managing the risks associated with future oil prices are critical for central governments and businesses. Therefore oil
price prediction and its risk measurement has been a common research theme in
the last decades. Some examples of the oil price prediction are (1) a semiparametric approach to shot-term oil price forecasting developed by Morana [7], (2)
a hybrid artiﬁcial intelligence system framework for crude oil price forecasting
by integrating artiﬁcial neural networks and rule-based expert system with webbased text mining techniques proposed by Wang et al. [10], and (3) a support
vector machine method (which is superior to the traditional ARIMA method and
the Wang et al. proposal) suggested by Xie et al. [11]. Our focus in this paper
is on oil price risk measurement. Previous work in this area includes (1) Cabedo
et al. [2] who proposed an ARMA historical simulation approach with Valueat-Risk (VaR) ideology and (2) Kuper [6] who investigated (G)ARCH-based
volatility performance with diﬀerent historical data. A good literature review on
oil price movements and their eﬀects on economic and ﬁnancial performance can
be referred to Sauter and Awerbuch [9].

Our motivation for concentrating on quantifying oil price risk are twofold.
First, as noted by Sauter and Awerbuch [9], while most oil price movements
from 1948-1985 were price increases, since 1986 the pattern has changed; more
speciﬁcally, large price decreases are now commonplace, implying a rise in the
volatility/risk of oil prices. Second, price risk in investments is more important
than price level which determines whether to invest or not. Compared with the
more developed ﬁnancial market risk measures, however, oil price risk management is still in its infancy. This is because, being a physical asset, oil has some
additional attributes that are not associated with traditional ﬁnancial assets. For
example, as Morana [7] points out, the price of oil is strongly inﬂuenced by transportation, inventory levels, weather, short-term demand and supply imbalances,
and political issues. Thus, volatile oil price movements motivate consideration of
how to quantify price risk. As a benchmark for measuring market risk, Value-atRisk (VaR) reduces the risk associated with any kind of asset to just a number
(amount in terms of a currency), which can be well understood by regulators,
board members, and other interested parties.
The main objective of this paper is to investigate the predictive performance
of various types of the conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) speciﬁcations for oil price risk prediction. The choice of this particular parametric
method is motived by the fact that CAViaR does not require any assumption
on the distribution of a time series and computes the VaR directly by quantile
regression, implying that the model allows the time series to switch from one
stochastic process to another. There are also two original theoretical contributions in this paper. First, we introduce a new exponentially weighted moving
average CAViaR speciﬁcation with only two parameters to be estimated, which
in turn may reduce the model estimate risk. Second, we develop a least squares
regression model for multi-period VaR prediction.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy summarizes the
CAViaR model and then proposes a new asymmetric CAViaR model. Section
3 provides some criteria for performance comparison. Section 4 presents some
empirical results, followed by our concluding comments in Section 5.

Model

While the concept of VaR is intuitive, its modeling is a very challenging statistical
problem. From a statistical point of view, VaR of a return series {rt }, conditional
on the information set Ft−1 , is deﬁned as the negative θ-quantile, qt (θ), for which
P(rt ≤ −qt (θ)|Ft−1 ) = θ.
2.1

CAViaR

Building on the fact that the volatility of returns is highly autocorrelated (clustering), Engle and Manganelli [4] proposed the CAViaR model which computes
qt (θ) directly. In this paper, we will focus on the following four speciﬁcations:

An Improved CAViaR Model for Oil Price Risk

939

Adaptive CAViaR: qt (θ) = qt−1 (θ) + β1 {[1 + exp(G[rt−1 + qt−1 (θ)])]−1 − θ},
Symmetric CAViaR: qt (θ) = β0 + β1 qt−1 (θ) + β2 |rt−1 |,
Asymmetric CAViaR: qt (θ) = β0 + β1 qt−1 (θ) + β2 (rt−1 )+ + β3 (rt−1 )− ,
2
2
(θ) + β2 rt−1
)1/2 .
GARCH(1,1) CAViaR: qt (θ) = (β0 + β1 qt−1
In the above, G is a positive number, and hence as G → ∞, the adaptive
CAViaR converges to qt (θ) = qt−1 (θ) + β1 [I(rt−1 ≤ −qt−1 (θ)) − θ], where I(·)
is the indicator function. As noted by Engle and Manganelli [4], the CAViaR
speciﬁcations generalize the traditional GARCH-based VaR models by allowing
for diﬀerent stochastic processes in the tail of the return series, and can also deal
with non-i.i.d. processes.
2.2

Improved CAViaR

Instead of estimating the entire distribution of a time series, the CAViaR model
computes the conditional quantile directly, thereby exhibiting some theoretical
advantages over the traditional VaR approach. However, in practice, CAViaR
may face some implementation challenges. For example, to investigate the diﬀerent eﬀects of positive and negative returns on the prediction from a VaR model,
Engle and Manganelli [4] suggested using the asymmetric CAViaR speciﬁcation.
This requires estimating four parameters in the optimization framework. Unfortunately, as an econometric model, more parameters may lead to more estimation
error, which will in turn make the model unstable or unrobust.
Based on the exponentially weighted moving average volatility prediction idea,
we propose a new asymmetric CAViaR model:
qt (θ) = β0 qt−1 (θ) + (1 − β0 )

v
v
I(rt−1 > 0) + I(rt−1 ≤ 0) |rt−1 − μ|,
1 − β1
β1

where v =
β12 + (1 − β1 )2 (0 < β1 < 1) and μ is the sample mean. This
CAViaR speciﬁcation allows the VaR prediction to respond asymmetrically to
positive and negative returns. For example, when β1 < 0.5, negative returns have
a larger inﬂuence on the VaR prediction. Moreover, in contrast to the asymmetric
CAViaR model in [4], our model has only two parameters to be estimated. In
Section 4, we show that our model can yield performance at least as good as the
model of Engle and Manganelli (2004).
For parameter estimation, we follow Engle and Manganelli [4] and employ the
linear and non-linear quantile techniques:
ˆ
β(θ)
= argminβ

θ|rt + qt (θ)| +
{t:rt ≥−qt (θ)}

(1 − θ)|rt + qt (θ)| .
{t:rt <−qt (θ)}

This regression technique has a tractable property in that it does not require
any assumption about the entire distribution of the error terms. Moreover, we
can easily conduct various hypothesis tests on the quantile models [4,5].

Multi-period CAViaR

The simplest approach to generating multi-period VaR forecasts is to multiply
the one step-ahead prediction by the square root of the holding period k, the
procedure usually used in RiskMetrics [8]. However, this approach implicitly requires that the variance of the time series is constant in the holding period,
thereby oﬀsetting advantage that CAViaR can accommodate diﬀerent stochastic processes in the holding period. But as a simple alternative, we provide an
intuitive least squares regression model for multi-period VaR estimates:
qt+k (θ) = α0 + α1 qt (θ) + α2 [I(rt ≤ −qt (θ)) − θ],
where k is the holding period and the parameters α0 , α1 , and α2 are estimated
by the least squares regression. This regression model incorporates the following
rules: When the time series
√ follows a unique stochastic process in the holding
period, α1 will approach k, and α0 and α2 will converge to 0. Moreover, in
a similar spirit to the adaptive CAViaR model, whenever the loss exceeds VaR
(underestimate), we increase it immediately, but when the loss does not exceed
VaR (overestimate), we just decrease it slightly.
Note that while the multi-period VaR prediction approach examined here has
two steps (estimate the one step-ahead VaR and estimate multi-period VaR)
it may be combined into one step and thereby estimating all the parameters
simultaneously.

Evaluation of Performance

To assess the predictive performance of the models investigated, in this section
we employ tests designed for evaluating the predictive quantile performance as
proposed by Bao et al. [1] and the references therein.
When assessing the accuracy of a VaR forecast model, there is always a general
hypothesis required to be satisﬁed. That is,
E[Ht (θ)|Ft−1 ] = θ,

(1)

where Ht (θ) = I(rt < −qt (θ)). Below we denote Ht = Ht (θ). If (1) holds, we say
the VaR prediction is eﬃcient with respect to Ft−1 . This means Ht is uncorrelated with any information in Ft−1 up to time t − 1. In this case, the forecast
for VaR at time t and Ht cannot be improved. There are two implications in
condition (1): correct unconditional coverage and independence of VaR forecasts.
With respect to the out-of-sample prediction, we split the sample into two
parts, Tin and Tout , and use Tin to estimate the parameters and Tout for outof-sample performance testing. Thus, we can compute the empirical coverage
probability resulting from the VaR prediction series {ˆ
qt (θ)}t∈Tout , that is,
θˆ =

1
|Tout |

ˆt,
H
t∈Tout

Where |Tout | denotes the cardinality of Tout . A VaR prediction model is preferred
if its θˆ is closer to the nominal value of θ.

Unconditional Coverage Test

ˆ t = 1 can be
Suppose VaR estimates are accurate. Then, the event of failure H
modeled as independent draws from a binomial distribution with a probability
of occurrence equal to the signiﬁcance level (θˆ = θ). Thus, the likelihood-ratio
test statistic (LR) is

ˆ |Tout| ∗(1−θ)
].
θ
LR = −2ln[(1 − θ)|Tout| ∗(1−θ) θ|Tout| ∗θ ] + 2ln[(1 − θ)

Under the null hypothesis, LR follows a χ2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
3.2

Independence Test

ˆ t = 1)
A good VaR model must generate independent forecasts, i.e., violation (H
today has no eﬀect on the probability of violation tomorrow.
In an approach similar to Engle and Manganelli [4], we investigate the regression of Ht on Ht−i (i = 1, · · · , M ) and qˆt (θ), that is,
M

Ht = θ 0 +

wi Ht−i + wM+1 qˆt (θ) + ut ,

(2)

i=1

where wi , i = 1, · · · , M + 1, are regression parameters and
ut =

−θ, with probability 1 − θ,
1 − θ, with probability θ.

Under the null hypothesis, θ0 = θ and wi = 0, i = 1, · · · , M + 1. Denoting
w0 = θ0 − θ, we rewrite (2) in vector notation as
H − θ1 = Xw + u,
where 1 denotes the vector of ones. Thus, under the null hypothesis, Θ0 : w = 0,
Engle and Manganelli [4] proposed the following test statistic:
DQ =

ˆ X Xw
ˆ
w
→ χ2M+2 (asymptotically).
θ(1 − θ)

In the empirical application, we follow Engle and Manganelli (2004) to explore
the dynamic quantile test: DQ in which X contains a constant, four lagged hits,
Ht−1 , · · · , Ht−4 , and a contemporaneous VaR estimate, qt (θ).

Oil Price VaR

To implement the Engle and Manganelli approach and our proposed CAViaR
model on real oil price risk forecasting, we took a sample of 2,475 daily data
from Energy Information Administration for Brent and WTI spot prices, and
computed the daily returns as 100 times the diﬀerence of the log of the prices,

thereby generating 2,474 return scenarios. The samples range from November
29, 1996 to November 28, 2006. We used the ﬁrst 1,974 observations for the
estimation of the model parameters and the remaining 500 for out-of-sample
testing. For the optimization routines, we employed a similar procedure to that
described by Engle and Manganelli (2004). Because the objective function of
the quantile regression model is designed to obtain the exact sample quantile
with a given level, it is not surprising that the in-sample empirical coverage is
quite precise (see Engle and Manganelli (2004) and Huang et al. (2006)). In this
paper, we concentrated on the one-day-ahead and ﬁve-day-ahead out-of-sample
VaR predictions. In the experiment, we use the empirical θ-quantile of the ﬁrst
300 observations as the initialization to compute the VaR series.
For the one day-ahead VaR forecasting, in Table 1 we report the values of
the empirical unconditional coverage probability and the p-value of the dynamic
quantile test. As described in Section 3, the empirical coverage probability θˆ
represents the percentage of observations falling below the VaR predictions. Ideally, with a suﬃciently large sample, the percentage should converge to θ. In
this sense, all the models (the Engle and Manganelli model and our proposed
model) pass the unconditional coverage test in general with only one exception
(the conﬁdence interval is [0.2%, 2%] at the 1% level and it is [3%, 7%] at the
5% level). Especially, all models perform well with Brent since the percentage of
empirical coverage seems reasonably close to 1% or 5%. There is a surprising result that the asymmetric CAViaR speciﬁcation does not pass the unconditional
coverage test at the 5% level (the empirical coverage 0.028 is out of the conﬁdence interval). This is in sharp contrast to the results reported by Engle and
Manganelli (2004) which show that the asymmetric CAViaR model may do the
best job.
With respect to the independence test, the adaptive model is rejected by Brent
and the improved CAViaR is rejected by WTI at the 1% level. However, all the
models survive in the independence test at the 5% level, producing rather large
p-values.
Figure 1 plots the Brent return and one-day-ahead VaR forecast curves, which
shows that although our proposed model has only two parameter, it can produce

Moreover, the superiority of our model will be more evident in the case of multiperiod prediction.

events (Sauter and Awerbuch (2002) and Wang et al. (2004) identify important
events aﬀecting the price of oil). We also report the out-of-sample forecasting
performance from the diﬀerent models. The basic measure reported is the coef-
