Abstract. This study proposes a novel neural-network-based fuzzy group forecasting model for foreign exchange rates prediction. In the proposed model,
some single neural network models are first used as predictors for foreign exchange rates prediction. Then these single prediction results produced by each
single neural network models are fuzzified into some fuzzy prediction representations. Subsequently, these fuzzified prediction representations are aggregated
into a fuzzy group consensus, i.e., aggregated fuzzy prediction representation.
Finally, the aggregated prediction representation is defuzzified into a crisp
value as the final prediction results. For illustration and testing purposes, a typical numerical example and three typical foreign exchange rates prediction experiments are presented. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model
can significantly improve the prediction performance for foreign exchange
rates.
Keywords: Artificial neural networks, fuzzy group forecasting, foreign

1 Introduction
Foreign exchange rate forecasting has been a common research stream in the last few
decades. Over this time, the research stream has gained momentum with the advancement of computer technologies, which have made many elaborate computation
methods available and practical [1]. Due to its high volatility, foreign exchange rates
forecasting is regarded as a rather challenging task. For traditional statistical methods,
it is hard to capture the high volatility and nonlinear characteristics hidden in the
foreign exchange market. As a result, many emerging artificial intelligent techniques,
such as artificial neural networks (ANN), were widely used in foreign exchange rates
forecasting and obtained good prediction performance. For example, De Matos [2]
compared the strength of a multilayer feed-forward neural network (FNN) with that of
a recurrent network based on the forecasting of Japanese yen futures. Kuan and Liu
[3] provided a comparative evaluation of the performance of MLFN and a recurrent

neural network (RNN) on the prediction of an array of commonly traded exchange
rates. In the article of Tenti [4], the RNN is directly applied to exchange rates forecasting. Hsu et al. [5] developed a clustering neural network (CNN) model to predict
the direction of movements in the USD/DEM exchange rate. Their experimental results suggested that their proposed model achieved better forecasting performance
relative to other indicators. In a more recent study by Leung et al. [6], the forecasting
accuracy of MLFN was compared with the general regression neural network
(GRNN). The study showed that the GRNN possessed a greater forecasting strength
relative to MLFN with respect to a variety of currency exchange rates. Similarly,
Chen and Leung [7] adopted an error correction neural network (ECNN) model to
predict foreign exchange rates. Yu et al. [8] proposed an adaptive smoothing neural
network (ASNN) model by adaptively adjusting error signals to predict foreign exchange rates and obtained good performance.
However, neural networks are a kind of very unstable learning paradigm. Usually,
small changes in the training set and/or parameter selection can produce large changes
in the predicted output. To remedy the drawbacks, this paper attempts to utilize a set
of neural network predictors to construct a fuzzy group forecasting methodology for
foreign exchange rates prediction. In the proposed model, a number of single neural
network models are first used as predictors for foreign exchange rates prediction.
Then these single prediction results produced by each single neural network models
are fuzzified into some fuzzy prediction representations. Subsequently, these fuzzified
prediction representations are aggregated into a fuzzy group consensus, i.e., aggregated fuzzy prediction representation. Finally, the aggregated fuzzy prediction representation is defuzzified into a crisp value as the final prediction results.
The major aim of this study is to present a new forecasting paradigm called fuzzy
group forecasting that can significantly improve the prediction capability of neural
networks. The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed neural network based fuzzy group forecasting model in detail. For further
illustration, a typical numerical example and three typical foreign exchange rates
prediction experiments are presented in Section 3. Section 4 concludes the study.

2 Neural-Network-Based Fuzzy Group Forecasting Methodology
In this section, a neural-network-based fuzzy group forecasting model is proposed for
time series prediction problem. The basic idea of the fuzzy group forecasting model is
to make full use of group member’s knowledge to make a more accurate prediction
over any single neural network predictors. For convenience of simplification, this
study utilizes three group feed-forward neural network members to construct a fuzzy
group forecasting model. Generally speaking, the neural-network-based fuzzy group
forecasting consists of four different steps.
Step I: Single Neural Predictor Creation. In order to construct different single neural
predictor for the neural network model with the same structure, we use different training sets to create different neural network predictors. In this study the bagging algorithm proposed by Breiman [9] is used to generate different training sets.

Step II: Single Predictors Fuzzification. Based on these different training sets, each
neural network can produce some different predictors. Using the different predictors,
we can obtain different prediction results. Because neural predictor is an unstable
learning paradigm, we are required to integrate these different results produced by
different predictors, as earlier noted in Section 1. For these different predictions, we
consider them as a fuzzy number for further processing. For example, suppose that the
original dataset is used to create k different training sets, i.e., TR1, TR2, …, TRk, via

f1i , f 2i , " f ki , for

the bagging algorithm, we can use them to generate k models, i.e.,

the ith neural network predictor. Accordingly, k different predictions, i.e.,

f1i ( x), f 2i ( x), " f ki ( x) , can be generated by the ith neural network predictor when
out-of-sample forecasting. In order to make full use of all information provided by
different predictions, without loss of generalization, we utilize the triangular fuzzy
number to construct the fuzzy representation for different predicted results. That is,
the smallest, average and largest of the k predictions are used as the left-, mediumand right membership degrees. That is, the smallest and largest values are seen as the
optimistic and pessimistic prediction and the average value is considered to be the
most likely prediction. Using this fuzzification method, one can make a fuzzy prediction judgment for each time series. More clearly, the triangular fuzzy number in this
case can be represented as

([ (
k ], [max ( f

)]
( x ) )])

~
Z i = ( z i1 , z i 2 , z i 3 ) = min f 1i ( x ), f 2i ( x ), " , f ki ( x ) ,

[∑

(1)

In such a fuzzification processing way, the prediction problem is extended into a
fuzzy group forecasting framework.
Step III: Fuzzy Prediction Aggregation. Suppose that there is p different group
members, i.e., p different neural network predictors, let Z~ = ψ ( Z~ 1 , Z~ 2 , " Z~ p ) be
the aggregation of the p fuzzy prediction representations where ψ(•) is an aggregation
function. Now how to determine the aggregation function or how to aggregate these
fuzzy prediction representations to be a group prediction consensus is an important
and critical problem under fuzzy group forecasting environment. Generally speaking,
there are many aggregation operators and rules that can be used to aggregate fuzzy
prediction representations. Usually, the fuzzy prediction representations of p group
members will be aggregated using a commonly used linear additive procedure, i.e.,

~
~
p
Z = ∑i =1 wi Z i =

(∑

p
i =1

wi z i1 , ∑i =1 wi z i 2 , ∑i =1 wi z i 3
p

)

(2)

where wi is the weight of the ith group forecasting member, i = 1, 2, …, p. The
weights usually satisfy the following normalization condition:

∑i =1 wi = 1
p

(3)

The key to this aggregation procedure is how to determine the optimal weight wi of
the ith fuzzy prediction representation under fuzzy group forecasting environment.

Often the fuzzy representations of the predictions are largely dispersed and separated.
In order to achieve the maximum similarity, the fuzzy prediction representations
should move towards one another. This is the principle on the basis of which an aggregated fuzzy prediction representation is generated. Relied on this principle, a leastsquares aggregation optimization approach is proposed to integrate fuzzy prediction
results produced by different prediction models.
The generic idea of this proposed aggregation optimization approach is to minimize
the sum of squared distance from one fuzzy prediction to another and
~ thus make
~ them
maximum agreement. Particularly, the squared distance between Z i and Z j can be
defined by

Using this definition, we can construct the following optimization model, which
minimizes the sum of the squared distances between all pairs of weights fuzzy prediction representations:

In order to solve the above optimal weights, the constraint (7) is first not considered. If the solution turns out to be nonnegative, then constraint (7) is satisfied automatically. Using Lagrange multiplier method, Equations (5) and (6) can construct the
following Lagrangian function:
p

L( w, λ ) = ∑

∑ [∑l =1 (wi zil − w j z jl ) ]− 2λ (∑i =1 wi = 1)

Using matrix form and above settings, Equations (10) and (6) can be rewritten as

BW − λI = 0

(12)

I TW = 1

(13)

Similarly, Equation (5) can be expressed in a matrix form as D = W BW . Because D is a squared distance which is usually larger than zero, B should be positive
definite and invertible. Using Equations (12) and (13) together, we can obtain
T

λ* = 1 (I T B −1 I )

(

W * = B −1 I

) (I

(15)

Since B is a positive definite matrix, all its principal minors will be strictly positive
and thus B is a nonsingular M-matrix [10]. According to the properties of M-matrices,
we know B-1 is nonnegative. Therefore W * ≥ 0, which implies that the constraint in
Equation (7) is satisfied.
Step IV: Aggregated Prediction Defuzzification. After completing aggregation, a
fuzzy group consensus can be obtained by Equation (2). To obtain crisp value of
credit score, we use a defuzzification procedure to obtain the crisp value for decisionmaking purpose. According to Bortolan and Degani [11], the defuzzified value of a
triangular fuzzy number

Z = ( z1 , z 2 , z 3 ) can be determined by its centroid, which is

computed by

In this way, a final group forecasting consensus is computed with the above processes. For illustration and verification purposes, an illustrated numerical example and
three typical foreign exchange rates are conducted.

3 Experiments
In this section, we first present an illustrative numerical example to explain the implementation process of the proposed fuzzy group forecasting model using US dollar
against Chinese Renminbi (USD/RMB) exchange rate series. Then three typical foreign
exchange rates, US dollar against each of the three currencies — British pounds (GBP),
euros (EUR) and Japanese yen (JPY), are used for testing. All four exchange data are
obtained from Pacific Exchange Rates Services (http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/), provided by
Professor Werner Antweiler, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.
3.1 An Illustrative Numerical Example
Assume that there is USD/RMB series covered from January 1, 2006 to November
30, 2006, one would like to predict future USD/RMB exchange rate, e.g., December
1, 2006. For simplification, we first apply three standard FNN models with different
topological structures to conduct this example. For example, we use three different
numbers of hidden neurons to generate three different FNN models. In this example,
we try to utilize five different models for prediction. For this purpose, the bagging
sampling algorithm [9] is then used to create five different training sets. For each
FNN model, five different training sets are used and five different prediction results
are presented. With the above assumptions, three FNN models can produce 15 different prediction results, each for five predictions, as shown below.
FNN (5-09-1) = (7.8211, 7.8321, 7.8451, 7.8122, 7.8247)
FNN (5-12-1) = (7.8309, 7.8292, 7.8302, 7.8385, 7.8278)
FNN (5-15-1) = (7.8082, 7.8199, 7.8208, 7.8352, 7.8393)
where the numbers in parentheses indicate the topological structures of standard FNN
model, for example, (5-12-1) represents five input nodes, twelve hidden nodes and
one output node. Using Equation (1), the predictions of the three FNN models can be
fuzzified into three triangular fuzzy numbers as fuzzy prediction representations, i.e.,

~
Z FNN1 = ( z11 , z12 , z13 ) = (7.8122,7.8270,7.8451)
~
Z FNN 2 = ( z 21 , z22 , z23 ) = (7.8278,7.8313,7.8385)
~
Z FNN 3 = ( z31 , z32 , z33 ) = (7.8082,7.8247,7.8393)
The subsequent task is to aggregate the three fuzzy prediction representations into
a group prediction consensus. Using the above optimization method, we can obtain
the following results:

⎡ 367.6760 − 183.9417
B = ⎢⎢− 183.9417 368.0916

The final step is to defuzzify the aggregated fuzzy prediction value into a crisp prediction value. Using Equation (14), the defuzzified value of the final group prediction
consensus is calculated by

z = (7.8161 + 7.8277 + 7.8410) 3 = 7.8282
According to the data source, the actual value of USD/RMB in December 1, 2006
is 7.8283. By comparison, our fuzzy group prediction is rather promising. For further
verification, three typical foreign exchange rates are tested.
3.2 Three Foreign Exchange Rates Prediction Experiments
In this subsection, three typical foreign exchange rates are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed neural network-based fuzzy group forecasting model. The data
used here are monthly and they consist of the USD/GBP, USD/EUR and USD/JPY.
We take monthly data from January 1971 to December 2000 as in-sample (training
periods) data sets (360 observations including 60 samples for cross-validations). We
also take the data from January 2001 to November 2006 as out-of-sample (testing
periods) data sets (71 observations), which is used to evaluate the good or bad performance of prediction based on some evaluation measurement. For evaluation, two
typical indicators, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) [1] and directional statistics (Dstat) [1] are used. In addition, for comparison purpose, linear regression (LinR),
logit regression (LogR) and single FNN model are used here. Particularly, we use ten
different FNN models with different structures to construct the fuzzy group forecasting model. In addition, the bagging algorithm [9] is used to create ten different training sets. Accordingly, the results obtained are reported in Table 1.

From Table 1, a clear comparison of various methods for the three currencies is
given via NMSE and Dstat. Generally speaking, the results obtained from the two tables also indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed neural network
based fuzzy group forecasting model is better than those of the single neural network
model, linear regression and logit regression forecasting models for the three main
currencies. The main reasons are that (1) aggregating multiple predictions into a
group consensus can definitely improve the performance, as Yu et al. [1] revealed; (2)
fuzzification of the predictions may generalize the model by processing some uncertainties of forecasting; and (3) as an “universal approximator”, neural network might
also make a contribution for the performance improvement.

4 Conclusions
In this study, a new neural network based fuzzy group forecasting model is proposed
for foreign exchange rates prediction. In terms of the empirical results, we can find
that across different models for the test cases of three main currencies — British
pounds (GBP), euros (EUR) and Japanese yen (JPY) — on the basis of different
evaluation criteria, our proposed neural network based fuzzy group forecasting
method performs the best. In the proposed neural network based fuzzy group forecasting cases, the NMSE is the lowest and the Dstat is the highest, indicating that the
proposed neural network based fuzzy group forecasting model can be used as a promising tool for foreign exchange rates prediction.
