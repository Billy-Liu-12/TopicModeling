Abstract. An R-minimum strategy, which was proposed and successfully
applied to analyse the non-linear finite deformation behaviours of elasto-plastic
materials (e.g. [1] [2]), is extended and applied here to simulate the deformation
behaviours of the rate-dependent materials. It involves no iterations, thus
belongs to the static-explicit algorithm and avoids the convergence problem
resulting from nonlinearities. The R-minimum strategy based adaptive control
scheme of the time step size is proposed and applied to the analysis of both
time-dependent and -independent viscous materials and verified through the
comparison with the others to demonstrate the stability, efficiency and
usefulness of this algorithm.
Keywords: R-minimum Strategy, Finite Element, Rate-Dependent Materials,

1 Introduction
In the current finite element analysis of non-linear deformation behaviours of a
several of materials (including the rate-dependent/-independent materials), the staticimplicit algorithm is widely applied. Usually, it employs the iterative scheme, such as
the Newton-Raphson and the modified Newton-Raphson, to treat the governing
equations as a system of non-linear equations and attempt to solve them by applying
the unbalanced forces, computing the corresponding displacement increments, and
iterating until the drift from the equilibrium state is under the prescribed small value.
One major disadvantage of the Newton-Raphson family of algorithms is that the
iterations may not converge, particularly when the behaviour is strongly non-linear.
Although many efforts have been made, there still exist problems to be overcome.
A so-called R-minimum strategy was proposed and extended to analyze the nonlinear deformation behaviours (including the thermal-mechanical coupling and
frictional contact) of elasto-plastic materials (e.g. [1-2]). The R-minimum strategy
belongs to the static-explicit algorithm involving no iterations and could avoid the
related convergence problems as mentioned above. One common problem for the
explicit algorithm is that it trends to drift from the equilibrium state as the solution
proceeds. This effect can be minimized by using the R-minimum to limit the size of

this increment step. The R-minimum strategy has been successfully applied for elastoplastic materials in the industry-strength finite element code and validated through
simulating sheet metal forming processes etc.(e.g. [3] and references thereafter), and
the in-house finite element code for frictional contact between deformation bodies and
successfully applied to simulate the structure assembling, stick-slip frictional
instability and earthquakes etc. (e.g. [4] and references thereafter). This paper will
focus on extending and applying the so-called R-minimum strategy to simulate the
non-linear deformation behaviours of rate-dependent materials,..

2 Constitutive Equations of Rate-Dependent Materials
Rate-dependent phenomena have been observed and described in certain science and
practical application fields, such as the Earth sciences and deformation/creep
behaviours of the metals/polymers at the high temperature. For simplicity and
focusing on the key point of this paper, i.e. to study the non-linear deformation
behaviours of rate-dependent materials using R-minimum strategy, a simple Voigt
typed visco-elastic material model is taken as an example to be studied here. It
includes two basic elements, the elastic and the viscous, being parallel connected. The
total stress σ ij is [e.g. 5]
η

σ ij = σ ij + σ ij
e

where σ ij and σ ij , the elastic and creep/viscous stress components of the Voigt
e

model, are given respectively by
η

σ ij = Cijkl ε kl , σ ij = ηijkl εkl
e

e

(2)

Summing up the contributions from equations (2) to equation (1), we have

σ ij = Cijkl ε kl + ηijkl εkl
e

(3)

where Cijkl and ηijkl are the Hooke’s elasticity and the viscosity matrix, respectively.
e

The linearilized form of equation (4) can be described as

σ ij = Cijkl εkl + ηijkl εkl
e

(4)

Assuming ε of equation (4) remains constant in a sufficient short time
increment Δt , we have
eη

σ ij = Cijkl Dkl + σ ij

Where

Cijkl = Cijkl + η ijkl Δt ,

Dkl and Dt kl are the deformation rates at the current and the previous time step,
*
respectively. Thus σ ij is known at the current configuration once the current time step

size Δt is defined.

3 Governing Equations
3.1 Finite Element Discretization

The updated Lagrangian rate formulation is employed to describe the nonlinear
deformation problem. The rate type equilibrium equation and the boundary at the
current configuration are equivalently expressed by a principle of virtual velocity of
the form

(7)

where V and S denote respectively the reference domains occupied by the body B and
its boundary at time t; S F is a part of the boundary of S on which the rate of nominal
traction F is prescribed; δ v is the virtual velocity field which satisfies the
i

D

condition δ v = 0 on the velocity boundary; τ ij is the Jaumann rate of Kirchhoff
stress; L is the velocity gradient tensor, L = ∂v / ∂x .
Substituting equation (5) into equation (7) leads to the final form of the virtual
velocity principle as

The eight-node hexahedron element is adopted here. The selective reduced
integration (SRI) algorithm, i.e. the B -method proposed by Hughes [6], is employed
to calculate equation (8). For an element E, the left side of equation (8) can be
rewritten as

are evaluated at all the Gauss interpolation points. In equation (10) and (11), N is the
shape function and α , β are nodal numbers; and N α , j is the differentiation of N α
with respect to the natural coordinate.
3.2 Time Integration Algorithm

The time integration method is one of key issues to formulate a nonlinear finite
element method. It is well known that the fully implicit method is often subjected to
bad convergence problems for a non-linear deformation. In order to avoid this, we
employ an explicit time integration procedure as follows. It is assumed that under a
sufficiently small time increment all rates in equation (7) can be considered constant
within the increment from t to t + Δt as long as there are no drastic changes of states
and deformation takes place. The R-minimum strategy is extended and used here to
choose the step size to avoid such a drastic change within an incremental step. Thus
all the rate quantities used to derive equation (7) are simply replaced as
D

Δu = v Δt and Δτ = τ Δt

(12)

Finally equation (8) can be rewritten as

( K + K η ) Δu = ΔF + ΔFη

(13)

Here K is the standard stiffness matrix; ΔF is the external force increment; Δu is
the nodal displacement increment; Kη and ΔFη are the contributions to the stiffness
matrix and force increment from the influence of the viscous terms.

4 Time Step Size Control
As described above, the R-minimum strategy was originally proposed and
successfully applied to analyze the non-linear deformation behaviours (including the
thermal coupling and frictional contact) of elastic/elasto-plastic materials [1-4], i.e.
the rate-independent materials. To ensure the stability and accuracy of the solution
due to the nonlinearity resulted from the rate-dependent effects in the model, the Rminimum strategy is extended here to control the time step size. Here we take
R-minimum = Δt Ttotal

(14)

where Ttotal is the total deformation time prescribed. Thus, the key problem in the
following is how to define the R-minimum to control the step size to minimize the
drift from the real solution. Considering a given non-linear deformation time Ttotal ,
one simple choice for the solution is to divide the total deformation process into the
smaller enough time steps with the same size. The smaller time step size is, the more
accurate result is. The sufficiently accurate result can be achieved with a small
enough time step size, but it requires more calculation steps and thus more computing
time cost. To improve the efficiency, i.e. to get the more accurate results with less

computation steps, an R-minimum strategy based adaptive algorithm for controlling
the variable time step size automatically is proposed and applied as following steps
for the visco-elastic materials. It keeps the similar idea as what we proposed for
solving the nonlinear problems of the elasto-plastic (i.e. rate-independent material)
materials [2-4]. (1). Let the prescribed total deformation time be Ttotal . For the first
calculation step, it can have the following two choices in the code: one is the pure
elastic deformation Δu is firstly calculated subject to the boundary conditions, i.e.

Kη = 0 and ΔFη = 0 in the stiffness equation (13); the other is that visco-elastic
deformation Δu is calculated with a given small enough time step size Δt1 , here

ΔFη = 0 , but Kη ≠ 0 in equation (13). Afterwards, the maximum deformation rate
Dmax at the integration points can be obtained to calculate the R-minimum value as

R-minimum =

ES
DmaxTtotal

, and then the time step size Δt 2 for the second step can be

decided from equation (14) as Δt 2 = R-minimum × Ttotal , here ES is the maximum
allowable deformation increment per time step. Then the visco-elastic or viscous only
deformation in the further time steps can be defined as follows; (2). If the sum of the
deformation time ∑ Δt j ≥ Ttotal , go to step 4; otherwise the time step size for the i + 1
step

can

R-minimum

be
(i )

calculated

as

Δti +1 = R-minimum × Ttotal
(i)

,

here

= ES Dmax Ttotal , Dmax is the maximum deformation rate at the
(i)

(i)

integration points calculated with the known solution Δui at the time step i; If
i +1

i

∑ Δt j > Ttotal , the R-minimum value is reduced to R-minimum = 1 − ∑ Δt j Ttotal .
j =1

j =1

Thus, the time size Δti +1 is finally defined by Δti +1 = R-minimum × Ttotal and then
(i)

applied to the stiffness equation (13) for the solution Δui +1 at the time step of i + 1 ;
(3). Repeat the step 2; (4). The total deformation process is over, and the total
displacement utotal = ∑ Δu j .

5 Application Examples
A beam with the quadrate cross-section of 2 mm × 2mm and the length of 20mm is
taken as an example to be analyzed here. It is fixed along all the directions at the left
end and loaded by the axial tensile nodal force of 800N to the elastic beam at the
other end firstly, and then keeps the above loading condition for the further creep
deformation for 1000 seconds. Two cases for the visco-elastic materials with the timeindependent and -dependent viscosity are investigated as follows.

5.1 Time Independent Viscosity Case

The following material parameters are used in this paper if not otherwise specified:
Young’s modulus E = 10000 MPa , Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.25 , the viscosity

η K = 10000 MPa and η G = 2000 MPa . Different results of deformation processes are
obtained corresponding to the different prescribed ES values and compared with each
other. Fig. 1 shows the displacement at the end of the beam. The smaller prescribed
ES value is, the closer to accurate result is, but the more time steps are required; and
when the ES value decreases to a certain value, its further decrease has almost no
effects on improving the accuracy of the results, although it takes more time steps to
complete. Take both the computing time cost and the accuracy issues together into
−5

as the safe strain increment value here.

The R-minimum strategy has also been compared with the equal time steps scheme
−5

as shown in Fig. 2. For ES = 2 × 10 , it automatically takes the smaller step size
(similar as Δt = 100 s ) due to the higher nonlinearity at the beginning deformation
stage, but gradually gets to the larger step size (similar as Δt = 200 s ) in the later
deformation stage. This makes it get the similar accuracy as that with the equal time
step Δt = 100 s , but use 3 time steps less in total (The R-minimum strategy based case
takes 7 steps, while that with the equal time step size of Δt = 100 s takes 10 steps as
shown in Fig. 2). Although the case of equal time step size Δt = 200 s takes 2 steps
less than the R-minimum strategy based case, it drifts more and more from the real
solution as the deformation proceeds. This demonstrates that the R-minimum strategy
based automatic control scheme of the time step size can keep sufficient accuracy of
the solution for the rate-dependent materials with the constant viscosity during the
whole deformation process with the less computational time cost.

The same model as that in section 5.1 is calculated here but with the timedependent viscosity defined as above. Here, let m=0.5, KK =5000MPa, KG
=1000MPa. The calculation results (as shown in Fig. 3) indicate that the smaller
prescribed ES value is, the closer to accurate result is, but the more time steps are
required; and when the ES value decreases to a certain value, its further decrease has
almost no influence on improving the accuracy of the results, although it takes more
time steps to complete.

The R-minimum strategy for ES = 2.5 × 10 has also been compared with the
equal time step scheme as shown in Fig. 4. It demonstrates that the R-minimum
strategy based automatic control scheme of the time step size can keep sufficient
accuracy of the solution for the rate-dependent materials with the time-dependent
viscosity during the whole deformation process with the less computational time cost.
The same conclusion was drawn from the above time-independent viscosity case.

6 Conclusions
A three-dimensional finite element computational model and code have been
developed to simulate the non-linear deformation behaviours of the rate-dependent
materials using the so-called R-minimum strategy. The R-minimum strategy, which
was proposed and successfully applied to analyse the non-linear deformation
behaviours of rate-independent elasto-plastic materials, is extended and applied here
to limit the size of increment time step in the finite element analysis of the non-linear
deformation behaviours of rate-dependent materials. The procedures to determine the
R-minimum (i.e. the time step size) for the rate-independent and the rate-dependent
materials are different, but it all involves no iterations, thus belongs to the staticexplicit algorithm and avoids the convergence problem resulting from nonlinearities.
A beam of visco-elastic materials is calculated with both the time-independent and the
time-dependent viscosity using the R-minimum strategy (i.e. an adaptive control
scheme of the time step size) and compared with the those using the equal time step
size scheme. The analysis results show that the R-minimum strategy based automatic
control scheme of the time step size can keep sufficient accuracy of the solution for
the visco-elastic materials with the time-independent and -dependent viscosity during
the whole deformation process with the reasonable computational time cost.
