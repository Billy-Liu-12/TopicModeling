Abstract. This paper computes the optimum number of cluster heads based on
power first, and then proposes the clustering algorithm for WSNs, at last
estimates its performances by our emulator. On analysis, clustering time
complexity is dependent on the network diameter and it is suitable for small or
medium networks. The simulation results show that using this clustering
algorithm can generate network topology of optimum number of clusters, the
nodes energy is reduced greatly and the lifetime of networks is extended.
Keywords: clustering topology, WSN, generation algorithm, cluster heads,
node energy.

1 Introduction
The main goal of the topology management for WSNs is to form an optimal
framework based on data transmission by removing unnecessary communication links
between nodes, and the prerequisite is to assure network coverage and connectivity [1].
There are two approaches to topology management in WSNs----power control and
hierarchical topology organization. Power control mechanisms adjust the power on a
per-node basis, so that one-hop neighbor connectivity is balanced and overall network
connectivity is ensured; With hierarchical topology control, a subset of the network
nodes is selected to serve as the network backbone over which essential network
control functions are supported[2]. This approach to topology control is often called
clustering, and our study on this paper focuses on the hierarchical clustering algorithm
for WSNs.

2 The Clustering Algorithm for WSNs
2.1 The Optimum Number of Cluster Heads Based on Power
To study on the hierarchical clustering algorithm for WSNs, we make the following
assumptions:

1) The nodes in WSNs are distributed as per a homogeneous spatial Poisson
process of intensity λ in a 2-dimensional space which is a square area of side 2a ,
and λ = λ0 + λ1 , where the intensity of cluster heads is λ1 , the intensity of non-cluster
heads is λ0 ; p with mean the probability of cluster heads in a WSN, thus λ1 = pλ ,
λ0 = (1 − p )λ ;
2) The total number of nodes in this area is n , and the area of this 2-dimensional
space is s , n with mean λ s , where s = 4a 2 ;
3) Also assume that the origin of coordinates is at the center of the square, and the
base station is located at (0,2a ) ;
4) We assume a simple model for the radio hardware energy dissipation where the
transmitter dissipates energy to run the radio electronics and the power amplifier, and
the receiver dissipates energy to run the radio electronics [3].
5) In this algorithm, the cluster heads creates a TDMA schedule telling each noncluster heads when it can transmit message.
According to the assumptions above, We get under the exponent the following
expression:
p=

10λ
0.0061632025n2

The computed values of p and the corresponding values of the number of nodes
n and the intensity of nodes λ for WSNs are provided in Table 1.
2.2 Parameters for the Clustering Algorithm
The weighted clustering algorithm (WCA) is an on-demand distributed clustering
algorithm proposed for mobile ad hoc networks [4]. It elects a node as a cluster head
based on four parameters as follows: the number of neighbors, transmit power,
battery-life and mobility rate of the node.
Because the nodes are stationary in WSNs, the considered parameters for the
optimizing algorithm of WCA are simple relatively. Consider three parameters as
follows: 1) the battery-life of nodes Ci _ res ; 2) The nodes degree-difference
Δi = di − E[ N ] , where E[ N ] = λ0 λ1 , and di means the neighbors’ number of nodes

i ; 3) The average distance between node and its neighbors di _ ave = Di di , where Di

means that the total distance between node i and its neighbors. Consider three
parameters above, the combined weight wi for node i in WSNs can be calculated:
wi = w1 ⋅

Ct
+ w2 ⋅ Δi + w3 ⋅ di − ave
Ci _ res

(2)

Where, Ct is defined as the initial energy of nodes, and w1 , w2 , w3 are defined
respectively as the weight of three parameters, where w1 + w2 + w3 = 1 . When the
smaller the weight wi , the bigger probability of node i being elected as a cluster
head.

2.3 The Generation of Clustering
The generation of clustering procedure consists of two processes: cluster heads
election phase and cluster Set-Up phase. During cluster heads election phase, the
suitable nodes are elected as cluster heads according to some topology control
algorithms for WSNs; during cluster Set-Up phase, the cluster heads broadcast their
states using the same transmit energy to the non-cluster heads in the networks, after
each node has decided to which cluster it belongs, it must inform the cluster head
node that it will be a member of the cluster, and then the framework of WSNs forms.

3 Simulation Study and Performance Evaluation
3.1 Simulation Study
The most important goal in WSNs is the effective utilization of energy, so in
simulation study, we considered the nexus between the number of cluster heads and
the total amplifier energy for WSNs. Figure 1 described the function diagram et ( p )
for 500, 1000 and 2000 nodes in WSNs, where et ( p ) is the total amplifier energy for
WSNs. It is evident that the total amplifier energy spent in the network is indeed
minimal at the theoretically optimal values of the parameter p computed using (1).

3.2 Performance Evaluation
In the clustering algorithm flowchart, its time complexity is O (n2 ) , where n with
mean the number of network nodes. When the size of network is small, the algorithm
is simple; when the size of network is large, it is necessary to set more parameters to
let it simple. We will study on this research in the future.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, take the optimum number of cluster heads based on power and the
optimizing algorithm of WCA into consideration, and generate the clustering topology
of WSNs. The simulation results show that because of this clustering algorithm, the
nodes energy is reduced greatly. This algorithm is suitable for the small and medium
networks. When the size of network is large, it is necessary to set more parameters to
let it simple. We will study on this research in the future. At same time, what need
study on deeply is how to design a routing protocol of security, QoS and so on based
on clustering.
