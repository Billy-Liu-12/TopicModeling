Abstract. For two integers s ≥ 0, t ≥ 0, G is (s, t)-superlerian, if
∀X, Y ⊂ E(G) with X ∩ Y = φ, where |X| ≤ s, |Y | ≤ t, G has a spanning eulerian subgraph H such that X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩ E(H) = φ. It is
obvious that G is supereulerian if and only if G is (0, 0)-supereulerian.
In this note, we have proved that when G is a (t + 2)-edge-connected
simple graph on n vertices, if n ≥ 21 and δ(G) ≥ n5 + t, then G is (3, t)supererlerian or can be contracted to some well classiﬁed special graphs.

Introduction

Graphs in this note are simple, ﬁnite and loopless. Undeﬁned terms and notations are from [2]. We use H ⊆ G to denote the fact that H is a subgraph of
G. For a graph G, O(G) denotes the set of all vertices of odd degree in G. A
graph G is called an even graph if O(G) = φ, and a connected even graph is an
eulerian graph. A graph is supereulerian if it has a spanning eulerian subgraph.
The collection of all supereulerian graphs will be denoted by SL. For the literature on the subject of supereulerian graphs, see Catlin’s excellent survey [4].
As indicated by the authors in [1], characterizing supereulerian graphs appears
very diﬃcult. Pulleyblank in [8] pointed out that the problem of determining if
a graph G is supereulerian is N P − complete.
In [7] Jaeger proved Theorem 1.1 below.
Theorem 1.1(Jaeger [7]). If G has two edge-disjoint spanning trees, then G is
in SL.
Let F (G) be the minimum number of edges that must be added to G so that
the resulting graph has 2 edge-disjoint spanning trees. Thus Theorem 1.1 says
that if F (G) = 0, then G ∈ SL. In [5] , Catlin showed that Theorem 1.1 can be
improved.

Theorem 1.2(Catlin [5]). If F (G) ≤ 2, then either G is in SL, or G can be
contracted to K2 or K2, t , where t is odd natural number.
In [3], Catlin got a degree condition for supererlerian graphs.
Theorem 1.3(Catlin [3]). Let G be a 2-edge-connected simple graph on n vertices. If δ(G) ≥ n5 , then G is supereulerian.
In this note, we want to improve the Theorem 1.3. We need the following concept.
For two integers s ≥ 0, t ≥ 0, G is (s, t)-superlerian, if ∀X, Y ⊂ E(G) with
X ∩ Y = φ, where |X| ≤ s, |Y | ≤ t, G has a spanning eulerian subgraph H
such that X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩ E(H) = φ. It is obvious that G is supereulerian
if and only if G is (0, 0)-supereulerian. The Theorem 1.3 then says G is (0, 0)supereulerian if δ(G) ≥ n5 with edge-connectivity≥ 2. In section 2, we shall
display some preliminaries and in section 3, we shall extend the Theorem 1.3 to
its (s, t)-supererlerian version.

Preliminaries

In [3], Catlin deﬁned the collapsible graphs. Let R ⊆ V (G), a graph H of G is
called an R − subgraph if both G − E(H) is connected and v ∈ R if v has odd
degree in H. A graph G is collapsible if for any even subset R of V (G), G has
an R-subgraph. Catlin showed in [4] that every vertex of G is lying in a unique
maximal collapsible subgraph of G. The collection of all collapsible graphs is
denoted by CL. Clearly CL ⊆ SL.
The contraction G/H is obtained from G by contracting each edge of H and
deleting the resulting loops. The reduction of G is obtained from G by contracting all maximal collapsible subgraphs, and is denoted by G . A graph G is
reduced if G is the reduction of some graph.
Theorem 2.1(Catlin [3]). Let G be a graph. Each of the following holds:
(1)G is reduced if and only if G has no nontrivial collapsible subgraphs;
(2)If G is reduced, then G is simple and contains no K3 , δ(G) ≤ 3;
(3)If G is reduced and |V (G)| ≥ 3, then F (G) = 2|V (G)| − |E(G)| − 2 ≥ 2;
(4)If H is a collapsible subgraph of G, then G ∈ CL if and only if G/H ∈ CL;
(5)If H is a collapsible subgraph of G, then G ∈ SL if and only if G/H ∈ SL.
Let G be a graph and let X ⊆ E(G). The graph GX is obtained from G by
replacing each edge e ∈ X with ends ue and ve by a (ue , ve )-path Pe of length
2, where the internal vertex we of the path Pe is newly added.
Lemma 2.2. Let G be a graph and let X ⊂ E(G), Y ⊂ E(G) with X ∩ Y = φ,
then G has a spanning eulerian subgraph H such that X ⊂ E(H) and Y ∩
E(H) = φ.

Lemma follows from the deﬁnitions.
We need the following deﬁnition. The Peterson graph is denoted by P .
Let F ={K1 , K2 , k2, t , K2, t , K2, t , K1, 3 (s, s , s ), S(m, l), J(m, l), J (m, l),
P }, where t, s, s , s , m, l are nonnegative integers. The deﬁnitions of K2, t ,
K2, t , K1, 3 (s, s , s ), S(m, l), J(m, l), J (m, l), please see the reference [6].
Theorem 2.3(Chen and Lai [6]). If G is a connected reduced graph with
|V (G)| ≤ 11 and F (G) ≤ 3, then G ∈ F.
Let F ∗ ={ G ∈ F: G is 2-edge-connected}∪{ G: the subdivision of K2, t , t is odd
natural number}∪F1 − SL, here F1 denotes the graph obtained from a K2, 3 and
C4 by identifying a vertex of degree 2 in K2, 3 with any one in C4 .

Main Result

Theorem 3.1. G is a (t + 2)-edge-connected simple graph on n vertices, where
t is a nonnegative integer. If n ≥ 21 and δ(G) ≥ n5 + t, take any two edgedisjoint subsets of E(G), X and Y , where |X| ≤ 3 and |Y | ≤ t, then G is
(3, t)-supereulerian or (G − Y )X is in F ∗ .
Note that in Theorem 3.1, G need to be (2 + t)-edge-connected because that
G − Y is supereulerian only when G − Y is 2-edge-connected. Before the proof
of the theorem 3.1, we need the following lemma:
Lemma 3.2. G is a connected simple graph on n vertices. G is the reduction
of G. V5 = {v ∈ V (G )|dG (v) < 5}. If δ(G) ≥ 5, then |V5 | ≤ 4.
Proofs of Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 are omitted because of the length.
