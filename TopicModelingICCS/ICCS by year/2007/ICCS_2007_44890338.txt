Abstract. In this paper, we prove that a 2-connected weighted graph
G contains either a Hamilton cycle or a cycle of weight at least 2m/3 if
it satisﬁes the following conditions: (1) 3i=1 dw (vi ) ≥ m, where v1 , v2
and v3 are three pairwise nonadjacent vertices of G, and two of them are
nonadjacent vertices of an induced claw or an induced modiﬁed claw; (2)
In each induced claw and each induced modiﬁed claw of G, all edges have
the same weight. This extends several previous results on the existence
of heavy cycles in weighted graphs.
Keywords: Hamilton cycle, weighted graph, induced claw (modiﬁed
claw.)

Terminology and Notation

We use Bondy and Murty [3] for terminology and notation not deﬁned here and
consider ﬁnite simple graphs only. Let G be a graph. G is called a weighted graph
if each edge e is assigned a nonnegative number w(e), called the weight of e. For
a subgraph H of G, V (H) and E(H) denote the sets of vertices and edges of
H, respectively. The weight of H is deﬁned by w(H) = e∈E(H) w(e). For a
vertex v ∈ V , NH (v) denotes the set, and dH (v) the number, of vertices in H
that are adjacent to v. We deﬁne the weighted degree of v in H by dw
H (v) =
w(vh).

respectively.

An unweighted graph can be regarded as a weighted graph in which each
edge is assigned weight 1. Thus, in an unweighted graph, dw (v) = d(v) for every
vertex v, and the weight of a subgraph is simply the number of its edges.
The number of vertices in a maximum independent set of G is denoted by
α(G). If G is noncomplete, then for a positive integer k ≤ α(G) we denote
by σk (G) the minimum value of the degree sum of any k pairwise nonadjacent
vertices, and by σkw (G) the minimum value of the weighted degree sum of any
k pairwise nonadjacent vertices. If k > α(G), then both σk (G) and σkw (G) are
deﬁned as ∞.
An (x, y)-path is a path connecting the two vertices x and y. A y-path is a
path which has y as one of its end-vertices. The distance between two vertices

x and y, denoted by d(x, y), is the length of a shortest (x, y)-path. We call the
graph K1,3 a claw, and the graph K1,3 + e (e is an edge between two nonadjacent
vertices in the claw) a modiﬁed claw. For a graph G, if there exist three pairwise
nonadjacent vertices in which two of them are nonadjacent in an induced claw
or an induced modiﬁed claw, then by σ w
3 (G) we denote the minimum value of
the weighted degree sum of such three pairwise nonadjacent vertices. Otherwise,

Results

In [8], P´
osa gave a degree sum condition for the existence of long cycles in graphs.
This result was generalized by the following two theorems along diﬀerent lines.
Theorem A (Fan [5]). Let G be a 2-connected graph such that max{d(x), d(y)|
d(x, y) = 2} ≥ c/2. Then G contains either a Hamilton cycle or a cycle of length
at least c.
Theorem B (Fournier & Fraisse [6]). Let G be a k-connected graph where
2 ≤ k < α(G), such that σk+1 (G) ≥ m. Then G contains either a Hamilton
cycle or a cycle of length at least 2m/(k + 1).
Bondy et al. [2] generalized the result of P´
osa to weighted graph. In [10], it was
showed that if one wants to give a generalization of Theorem A to weighted
graphs, some extra conditions cannot be avoided. By adding two extra conditions, the authors gave a weighted generalization of Theorem A. Motivated by
this result, by adding two same extra conditions, Zhang et al. [9] gave a weighted
generalization of Theorem B in the case k = 2.
Theorem 1 (Zhang et al. [9]). Let G be a 2-connected weighted graph which
satisﬁes: (1) σ3w (G) ≥ m; (2) w(xz) = w(yz) for every vertex z ∈ N (x) ∩
N (y) with d(x, y) = 2; (3) In every triangle T of G, either all edges of T have
diﬀerent weights or all edges of T have the same weight. Then G contains either
a Hamilton cycle or a cycle of weight at least 2m/3.
Theorem A was further extended by the following result.
Theorem C (Bedrossian et al.[1]). Let G be a 2-connected graph. If max
{d(x), d(y)} ≥ c/2 for each pair of nonadjacent vertices x and y, which are
vertices of an induced claw or an induced modiﬁed claw of G, then G contains
either a Hamilton cycle or a cycle of length at least c.
By adding one extra condition, Fujisawa [7] gave a weighted generalization of
Theorem C.
Theorem 2 (Fujisawa [7]). Let G be a 2-connected weighted graph which satisﬁes: (1) For each induced claw and each induced modiﬁed claw of G, all its
nonadjacent pair of vertices x and y satisfy max{dw (x), dw (y)} ≥ s/2; (2) For
each induced claw and each induced modiﬁed claw of G, all of its edges have the
same weight. Then G contains either a Hamilton cycle or a cycle of weight at
least s.

Clearly, Conditions (2) and (3) of Theorem 1 imply Condition (2) of Theorem
2. In a previous paper [4], the authors proved that Conditions (2) and (3) of
Theorem 1 can be replaced by Condition (2) of Theorem 2. Here we will further
show that Condition (1) of Theorem 1 can also be replaced by a weaker one.
Theorem 3. Let G be a 2-connected weighted graph which satisﬁes the following
conditions: (1) σ w
3 (G) ≥ m; (2) For each induced claw and each induced modiﬁed
claw of G, all of its edges have the same weight. Then G contains either a
Hamilton cycle or a cycle of weight at least 2m/3.

Proof of Theorem 3

We call a path P a heaviest longest path of a graph G if P has the following
properties
• P is a longest path of G, and
• w(P ) is maximum among all longest paths in G.
Proposition 1. Let G be a non-hamiltonian 2-connected weighted graph which
satisﬁes conditions (1) and (2) of Theorem 3. Then G contains a heaviest longest
path P = v1 v2 · · · vp , such that dw (v1 ) + dw (vp ) ≥ 2m/3.
We prove this proposition in the next section. Theorem 3 can be proved by
combining Proposition 1 and the following lemma. The proof of Lemma 1 is
implicit in [2].
Lemma 1 (Bondy et al. [2]). Let G be a non-hamiltonian 2-connected
weighted graph and P = v1 v2 · · · vp be a heaviest longest path in G. Then there
is a cycle C in G with w(C) ≥ dw (v1 ) + dw (vp ).
Proof of Theorem 3. Suppose that G does not contain a Hamilton cycle. Then
by Proposition 1 and Lemma 1, we can ﬁnd a cycle of weight at least 2m/3.

Proof of Proposition 1

In the proof of Proposition 1, we need the following two lemmas.
Lemma 2 (Fujisawa [7]). Let G be a weighted graph satisfying Condition (2)
of Theorem 3. If x1 yx2 is an induced path with w(x1 y) = w(x2 y) in G, then
each vertex x ∈ N (y)\{x1 , x2 } is adjacent to both x1 and x2 .
Lemma 3 (Fujisawa [7]). Let G be a weighted graph satisfying Condition (2)
of Theorem 3. Suppose x1 yx2 is an induced path such that w1 = w(x1 y) and
w2 = w(x2 y) with w1 = w2 , and yz1 z2 is a path such that {z1 , z2 } ∩ {x1 , x2 } = ∅
/ E(G). Then the following (i) and (ii) hold:
and x2 z2 ∈
(i) {z1 x1 , z1 x2 , z2 x1 } ⊆ E(G), and yz2 ∈
/ E(G). Moreover, all edges in the
subgraph induced by {x1 , y, x2 , z1 , z2 }, other than x1 y, have the same weight w2 .

(ii) Let Y be the component of G − {x2 , z1 , z2 } with y ∈ V (Y ). For each vertex
v ∈ V (Y )\{x1 , y}, v is adjacent to all of x1 , x2 , y and z2 . Furthermore, w(vx1 ) =
w(vx2 ) = w(vy) = w(vz2 ) = w2 .
Proof of Proposition 1. Choose a heaviest longest path P = v1 v2 · · · vp in G
such that dw (v1 ) + dw (vp ) is as large as possible. It is clear that N (v1 ) ∪ N (vp ) ⊆
V (P ). And it is not diﬃcult to prove that there exists no cycle of length p.
Suppose dw (v1 ) + dw (vp ) < 2m/3. Without loss of generality, we may assume
w
d (v1 ) < m/3.
Claim 1. Let P1 and P2 be two heaviest longest paths such that P1 has v and
vp as its end-vertices, and P2 has v and vp as its end-vertices. Then v and v
cannot be nonadjacent vertices of an induced claw or an induced modiﬁed claw.
Proof. Suppose v and v are nonadjacent vertices of an induced claw or an
/ E(G)
induced modiﬁed claw. Since P1 and P2 are heaviest longest paths, v vp ∈
and v vp ∈
/ E(G). By the choice of the path P in (b), dw (v ) ≤ dw (v1 ) and
dw (v )+dw (vp ) < 2m/3. So we have dw (v )+dw (v )+dw (vp ) < m, contradicting
Condition (1) of Theorem 3.
Since G is 2-connected, v1 is adjacent to at least one vertex on P other than v2 .
Choose vk ∈ N (v1 ) such that k is as large as possible. It is clear that 3 ≤ k ≤
p − 1.
Case 1. N (v1 ) = {v2 , · · · , vk }.
Since P is longest and N (v1 ) = {v2 , · · · , vk }, N (vi ) ⊆ V (P ) for every i with
i = 2, · · · , k − 1; Since G is a non-hamiltonian 2-connected graph, k + 2 ≤ p;
Since G − vk is connected, there must be an edge vj vs ∈ E(G) with j < k < s.
We assume that such an edge vj vs was chosen so that: (i) s is as large as
possible; (ii) j is as large as possible, subject to (i). Clearly we have s ≤ p − 1.
Claim 2. w(v1 vj+1 ) = w(vj vj+1 ).
Proof. Suppose j ≤ k − 2. By the choices of vk , vj and vs , we have v1 vs ∈
/ E(G)
and vj+1 vs ∈
/ E(G). So {vj , v1 , vj+1 , vs } induces a modiﬁed claw, which implies
that w(v1 vj+1 ) = w(vj vj+1 ).
Suppose j = k − 1 and s ≥ k + 2. By the choices of vk and vs , we have
v1 vs ∈
/ E(G), v1 vs+1 ∈
/ E(G) and vj vs+1 ∈
/ E(G). If vk vs+1 ∈ E(G), then
{vk , v1 , vk−1 , vs+1 } induces a modiﬁed claw. So w(v1 vk ) = w(vk−1 vk ). If vk vs ∈
/
E(G), then {vk−1 , v1 , vk , vs } induces a modiﬁed claw. So w(v1 vk ) = w(vk−1 vk ).
If vk vs+1 ∈
/ E(G) and vk vs ∈ E(G), then {vk , v1 , vk+1 , vs } induces a claw or a
modiﬁed claw. So w(v1 vk ) = w(vk vs ); On the other hand, {vs , vk−1 , vk , vs+1 }
induces a modiﬁed claw. So w(vk vs ) = w(vk−1 vk ); Then w(v1 vk ) = w(vk−1 vk ).
Suppose j = k − 1 and s = k + 1. Since P is longest, N (vk ) ⊂ V (P ); Since
G − vk+1 is connected, there exists an edge vk vt ∈ E(G) with t ≥ k + 2. Choose
vk vt such that t is as small as possible. So {vk , v1 , vk−1 , vt } induces a modiﬁed
claw. Then w(v1 vk ) = w(vk−1 vk ).

Claim 3. s = k + 1.
Proof. Suppose s ≥ k + 2. Let P = vs−1 vs−2 · · · vj+1 v1 v2 · · · vj vs vs+1 · · · vp . If
vj vs−1 ∈ E(G), then {vj , v1 , vs−1 , vs } induces a modiﬁed claw, so w(vs−1 vs ) =
w(vj vs ). By Claim 2, now P is a heaviest longest vp -path diﬀerent from P ,
contradicting Claim 1. If vj vs−1 ∈
/ E(G), then {vs , vj , vs−1 , vs+1 } induces a claw
or a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(vs−1 vs ) = w(vj vs ). By Claim 2, both vj vj−1 · · · v1
vj+1 vj+2 · · · vp and P are heaviest longest vp -paths, contradicting Claim 1.
As in the proof of Claim 2, since s = k + 1 and G − vk+1 is connected, there
exists an edge vk vt ∈ E(G) with k + 2 ≤ t ≤ p − 1. Choose vk vt such that t is as
small as possible.
Case 1.1. t ≥ k + 3.
/ E(G) and vk vk+2 ∈
/ E(G). So {vk+1 , vj ,
By the choices of vs and vt , vj vk+2 ∈
vk , vk+2 } induces a claw or a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(vk vk+1 ) = w(vj vk+1 ).
/ E(G). By the choice of vt , vk vt−1 ∈
/ E(G). So {vt , vk , vt−1 ,
Suppose vk vt+1 ∈
vt+1 } induces a claw or a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(vt−1 vt ) = w(vk vt ). By Claim 2,
both vk vk−1 · · · vj+1 v1 · · · vj vk+1 · · · vp and vt−1 vt−2 · · · vk+1 vj vj−1 · · · v1 vj+1 · · ·
vk vt vt+1 · · · vp are heaviest longest vp -paths, contradicting Claim 1. Suppose
vk vt+1 ∈ E(G). By the choice of vk , v1 vt ∈
/ E(G) and v1 vt+1 ∈
/ E(G). So
{vk , v1 , vt , vt+1 } induces a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(vk vt+1 ) = w(vt vt+1 ). By Claim
2, vt vt−1 · · · vk+1 vj vj−1 · · · v1 vj+1 · · · vk vt+1 vt+2 · · · vp is a heaviest longest vp path diﬀerent from P , contradicting Claim 1.
Case 1.2. t = k + 2.
By the choice of vk , now {vk , v1 , vk+1 , vk+2 } induces a modiﬁed claw. So we get
w(vk vk+1 ) = w(vk vk+2 ) = w(vk+1 vk+2 ) = w(v1 vk ).
Since G − vt is connected, there exists an edge vk+1 vt ∈ E(G) with t ≥ k + 3.
/ E(G) and vj vt ∈
/ E(G). So {vs , vj , vt , vt } induces
By the choice of vs , vj vt ∈
a claw or a modiﬁed claw. In this case s = k + 1 and t = k + 2, thus we have
w(vj vk+1 ) = w(vk+1 vk+2 ). By Claim 2, now vk+1 vj vj−1 · · · v1 vj+1 vj+2 · · · vk vk+2
· · · vp is a heaviest longest vp -path diﬀerent from P . At the same time, v1 and
vk+1 are nonadjacent vertices in the modiﬁed claw induced by{vk , v1 , vk+1 , vk+2 },
contradicting Claim 1.
This completes the proof of Case 1.
Case 2. N (v1 ) = {v2 , · · · , vk }.
/ N (v1 ) with 2 < r < k such that r is as large as possible. Then
Choose vr ∈
v1 vi ∈ E(G) for every i with r < i ≤ k. Let j be the smallest index such that
/ N (v1 ) ∩ N (vr ). Since vr+1 ∈ N (v1 ) ∩ N (vr ), we have j ≥ r + 2.
j > r and vj ∈
On the other hand, it is obvious that j ≤ k + 1. By the choice of vr and vj ,
now v1 and vr are nonadjacent vertices of a claw or a modiﬁed claw induced by
{vj−1 , v1 , vr , vj }. By Claim 1 and the choice of P , we have the following claim.
Claim 4. There exists no heaviest longest vp -path with vr as it’s another endvertex.
Claim 5. w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ).

Proof. If w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ), then vr vr−1 · · · v1 vr+1 vr+2 · · · vp is a heaviest
longest vp -path diﬀerent from P , contradicting Claim 4.
Claim 6. vr+1 vj ∈
/ E(G).
/ E(G). So, if vr+1 vj ∈ E(G), then by the
Proof. By the choice of vr , v1 vr ∈
choice of vj , we know that {vr+1 , v1 , vr , vj } induces a claw or a modiﬁed claw.
Thus w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ), contradicting Claim 5.
By Claim 6, we have r + 3 ≤ j ≤ k + 1. Let n be the largest index such that
r + 1 ≤ n ≤ j − 2 and vn vj ∈
/ E(G). Then vi vj ∈ E(G) for every i with
n + 1 ≤ i ≤ j − 1.
Claim 7. If r + 3 ≤ j ≤ k, then w(v1 vn+1 ) = w(vn vn+1 ).
Proof. By the choice of vn , vn+1 vj ∈ E(G). So {vn+1 , v1 , vr , vj } induces a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(v1 vn+1 ) = w(vn+1 vj ). Since vr vj ∈
/ E(G) and vn vj ∈
/ E(G),
{vr , vn , vn+1 , vj } induces a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(vn vn+1 ) = w(vn+1 vj ). So
w(v1 vn+1 ) = w(vn vn+1 ).
Case 2.1. r + 3 ≤ j ≤ k − 1.
/ E(G). By Claim 6, vr+1 vj ∈
/ E(G), so {v1 , vj , vj+1 , vr+1 }
Suppose vr+1 vj+1 ∈
induces a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(v1 vj+1 ) = w(vj vj+1 ). Suppose vr+1 vj+1 ∈
E(G). By Claim 5 and the choice of vj , applying Lemma 3 (i) to {v1 , vr+1 , vr ,
vj+1 , vj }, we get w(v1 vj+1 ) = w(vj vj+1 ).
By Claim 7, both vn vn−1 · · · v1 vn+1 vn+2 · · · vp and vj vj−1 · · · v1 vj+1 vj+2 · · · vp
are heaviest longest vp -paths. Furthermore, vn and vj are nonadjacent vertices
in the modiﬁed claw induced by {vr , vn , vn+1 , vj }, contradicting Claim 1.
Case 2.2 j = k.
Since {vj−1 , v1 , vr , vj } induces a claw or a modiﬁed claw and j = k, we have
Claim 8. w(v1 vk−1 ) = w(v1 vk ) = w(vk−1 vk ).
Claim 9. vr+2 vk ∈
/ E(G).
Proof. Suppose vr+2 vk ∈ E(G). Applying Lemma 3 (ii) to {v1 , vr+1 , vr , vr+2 , vk }
and the vertex v2 (which is adjacent to v1 ), we get v2 vr+1 ∈ E(G) and w(v1 v2 ) =
w(v2 vr+1 ) = w(v1 vk ) = w(vr vr+1 ). By Claim 8, vr vr−1 · · · v2 vr+1 vr+2 · · · vk−1 v1
vk vk+1 · · · vp is a heaviest longest vp -path, contradicting Claim 4.
Now, we have vr+1 vk−1 ∈
/ E(G). Since otherwise, applying Lemma 3 (ii) to
{v1 , vr+1 , vr , vk−1 , vk } and the vertex vr+2 (which is adjacent to vr+1 ), we get
vr+2 vk ∈ E(G), contradicting Claim 9. By Claim 6, vk−1 and vr+1 are nonadjacent vertices in the modiﬁed claw induced by {v1 , vr+1 , vk−1 , vk }.
By Claims 6 and 9, now {v1 , vr+1 , vr+2 , vk } induces a modiﬁed claw. Then
w(v1 vr+2 ) = w(vr+1 vr+2 ). By Claim 8, both vk−1 vk−2 · · · v1 vk vk+1 · · · vp and
vr+1 vr · · · v1 vr+2 · · · vp are heaviest longest vp -paths, contradicting Claim 1.

Case 2.3 j = k + 1.
Since {vj−1 , v1 , vr , vj } induces a claw or a modiﬁed claw, we have
Claim 10. w(v1 vk ) = w(vk vk+1 ) = w(vr vk ).

Claim 11. vr+1 vk ∈
Proof. Suppose vr+1 vk ∈ E(G). Applying Lemma 3 (ii) to {v1 , vr+1 , vr , vk , vk+1 }
and the vertex vr−1 (which is adjacent to vr ), we get vr−1 vk+1 ∈ E(G) and
w(vr−1 vr ) = w(vr−1 vk+1 ). By Claim 10, we get a heaviest longest vp -path
vr vr+1 · · · vk v1 v2 · · · vr−1 vk+1 vk+2 · · · vp , contradicting Claim 4.
/ E(G) for every vi ∈ N (v1 ) ∩ N (vr ) \ {vk }.
Claim 12. vi vk+1 ∈
Proof. Suppose there exists a vertex vi ∈ N (v1 )∩N (vr )\{vk } such that vi vk+1 ∈
E(G). If w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(v1 vk ), then applying Lemma 3 (i) to {vr+1 , v1 , vk , vi ,
vk+1 }, we get w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vk vk+1 ). So w(v1 vk ) = w(vk vk+1 ), contradicting Claim 10. So we get w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(v1 vk ). Similarly, we can prove that
w(vr vr+1 ) = w(vr vk ). By Claim 10, we get w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ), contradicting Claim 5.
Claim 13. w(v1 vk−1 ) = w(vk−1 vk ).
/ E(G) and vk−1 vk+1 ∈
/
Proof. By the choice of vk and Claim 12, we get v1 vk+1 ∈
E(G). So{vk , v1 , vk−1 , vk+1 }induces a modiﬁed claw and w(v1 vk−1 ) = w(vk−1 vk ).
Case 2.3.1. w(vr vr+1 ) = w(vr vk ).
/ E(G). Furthermore, vr vk+1 ∈
/ E(G), since otherwise it
By Claim 11, vr+1 vk ∈
follows from Lemma 2 that vr+1 vk+1 ∈ E(G), which contradicts Claim 6.
Applying Lemma 2 to the induced path vr+1 vr vk and the vertex vr−1 ∈
N (vr )\{vr+1 , vk }, we get vr−1 vr+1 ∈ E(G) and vr−1 vk ∈ E(G). By Claim
5, w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ). Applying Lemma 2 to the induced path v1 vr+1 vr
and the vertex vr−1 ∈ N (vr+1 )\ {v1 , vr }, we get v1 vr−1 ∈ E(G). This implies
that vr−1 ∈ N (v1 ) ∩ N (vr ). By Claim 12, we have vr−1 vk+1 ∈
/ E(G). Then
{vk , vr−1 , vr , vk+1 } induces a modiﬁed claw, so w(vr−1 vr ) = w(vr−1 vk ). Therefore, by Claim 13, vr vr+1 · · · vk−1 v1 v2 · · · vr−1 vk vk+1 · · · vp is a heaviest longest
vp -path, contradicting Claim 4.
Case 2.3.2. w(vr vr+1 ) = w(vr vk ).
By Claim 5 and Claim 10, we can get that w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(v1 vk ).
Claim 14. v2 vk , v2 vr+1 and v2 vr ∈ E(G).
/ E(G). Applying Lemma 2 to the induced path
Proof. By Claim 11, vr+1 vk ∈
vr+1 v1 vk and the vertex v2 ∈ N (v1 )\{vr+1 , vk }, we get v2 vk ∈ E(G) and
v2 vr+1 ∈ E(G). By Claim 5, w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ). Applying Lemma 2 to
the induced path v1 vr+1 vr and the vertex v2 ∈ N (vr+1 )\{v1 , vr }, we get v2 vr ∈
E(G).

Claim 15. vr vk+1 ∈
/ E(G).
Proof. Suppose vr vk+1 ∈ E(G). By Claim 14, we get v2 ∈ N (v1 ) ∩ N (vr ),
/ E(G) and
v2 vk and v2 vr+1 ∈ E(G). By Claims 6 and 12, we get vr+1 vk+1 ∈
v2 vk+1 ∈
/ E(G). Thus both {vr , v2 , vr+1 , vk+1 } and {vk , v1 , v2 , vk+1 } induce modiﬁed claws. Then we have w(v2 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ) = w(v1 v2 ) = w(v1 vk ). By
Claim 13, we get w(v1 vk−1 ) = w(vk−1 vk ). So, vr vr−1 · · · v2 vr+1 vr+2 · · · vk−1 v1 vk
vk+1 · · · vp is a heaviest longest vp -path, contradicting Claim 4.
Suppose v1 vr−1 ∈ E(G). Then by applying Lemma 2 to the induced path
vk v1 vr+1 and vr−1 ∈ N (v1 )\{vk , vr+1 }, we get vr−1 vk ∈ E(G) and vr−1 vr+1 ∈
/ E(G) and vr vk+1 ∈
/ E(G).
E(G). By Claims 12 and 15, we get vr−1 vk+1 ∈
Then {vk , vr−1 , vr , vk+1 } induces a modiﬁed claw. Thus w(vr−1 vr ) = w(vr−1 vk ).
Therefore, by Claim 13, we have vr vr+1 · · · vk−1 v1 v2 · · · vr−1 vk vk+1 · · · vp is a
heaviest longest vp -path, contradicting Claim 4.
Suppose v1 vr−1 ∈
/ E(G). Then by Claim 5 and Lemma 2, we have vr−1 vr+1 ∈
/
/ E(G), since otherwise, applying Lemma 3 (ii)
E(G). Furthermore, v2 vr−1 ∈
to {vr , vr+1 , v1 , v2 , vr−1 } and the vertex vk (which is adjacent to vr ), we get
w(v1 vr+1 ) = w(v1 vk ), a contradiction. By Claims 12 and 14, v2 vk+1 ∈
/ E(G).
Then, both {vr , vr+1 , v2 , vr−1 } and {vk , v1 , v2 , vk+1 } induce modiﬁed claws. Thus
w(v2 vr+1 ) = w(vr vr+1 ) and w(v1 v2 ) = w(v1 vk ). By Claim 13, we know that
vr vr−1 · · · v2 vr+1 vr+2 · · · vk−1 v1 vk vk+1 · · · vp is a heaviest longest vp -path, contradicting Claim 4.
The proof of the theorem is complete.
