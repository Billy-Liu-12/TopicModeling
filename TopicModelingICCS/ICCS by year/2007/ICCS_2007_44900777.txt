Abstract. In multi-level HMIPv6 (M-HMIPv6) networks the MN has to select
a proper MAP using MAP selection schemes when migrating to the visited
ARs. Currently, distance-based MAP Selection (DMS), Mobility-based MAP
Selection (MMS) and Adaptive MAP Selection (AMS) schemes have been
proposed, and AMS outperforms the other ones in several aspects. However,
none of these schemes consider the handover Quality-of-Service (QoS) of
mobile multimedia services as the metric for MAP selection. In this paper, we
propose a novel QoS-aware MAP selection (QMS) scheme. In this scheme, the
optimal MAP is determined according to the average handover delay (AHD)
which characterizes the handover QoS for mobile multimedia services. We
derive a lemma through theoretical analysis to estimate the AHD and design the
procedure of QMS scheme based on this lemma. Through extensive NS-2
simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and its
advantage in AHD than AMS.
Keywords: Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Mobility Anchor Point
(MAP), handover delay, Quality of Service (QoS).

1 Introduction
Due to the limitation of Mobile IPv6 [1] for micro mobility management, Hierarchical
Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [2] [3] [10] was proposed by IETF to reduce the signaling
cost and handover delay by adopting a Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) which can
handle the localized mobility [3]. But in HMIPv6 networks with single MAP, the
capacity and reliability of the networks need to be improved [5] [6] [10]. To meet this
requirement, Multi-level HMIPv6 (M-HMIPv6) networks [5-9] were proposed inside
which there are multiple MAPs. And, these MAPs forms different levels according to
the number of hops from them to the Access Router (AR). In such circumstances,
there exist more than one MAPs above the ARs, and it is essential for the MN to
select an optimal MAP when it visits the ARs using MAP selection schemes. Several
schemes have been proposed for MAP selection in M-HMIPv6 networks such as
Distance-based MAP Selection (DMS) [2], Mobility-based MAP Selection (MMS)
[8] [9], Adaptive MAP Selection (AMS) [6], mobile history-based MAP selection
[12] and abstraction node based MAP selection schemes [7], etc.

All the existing MAP selection schemes adopt different metrics including distance,
mobile history, load balance, location update cost and packet delivery cost, etc.
However, they don’t consider QoS of mobile multimedia services, such as handover
delay, as the metric for MAP selection [16]. We believe that handover QoS of mobile
multimedia services are crucial issues that should be considered during MAP selection
because the handover performance is strongly dependant upon the selection of MAPs.
In this paper, we propose a novel QoS-aware MAP selection scheme (QMS) which
determines the optimal MAP based on average handover delay (AHD). We analyze
the handover process theoretically, and derive a lemma to characterize the impact of
MAP selection on AHD. Then, we conduct NS-2 simulations to verify our design.
The results show that the analyses and the simulations are consistent. Finally, we
compare our scheme with AMS, which is the most convincing scheme in the
literature. The results show our scheme outperforms AMS in AHD.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the architecture of
M-HMIPv6 networks, and gives a lemma to estimate the AHD in M-HMIPv6
networks which is the key design for QMS scheme. Then, the procedure of QMS
scheme is given. In Section 3, numerical analyses and NS-2 simulations are
conducted to verify our design. In Section 4, the performance of QMS and AMS is
compared through NS-2 simulations. And, the conclusions are given in Section 5.

to the ARs. For example, MAP0 is the Level-1 MAP and there are three hops from it
to an AR, e.g., AR1. MAP1 and MAP2 are Level-2 MAPs since there are two hops
away from AR1. To select a proper MAP for the MN, dynamic MAP discovery
process [3] is conducted periodically. With this process, the information of available
MAPs is collected and delivered to the ARs. When the MN migrates to an AR, e.g.,
AR2, it receives the Router Advertisement (RA) [1] [2] messages which contain the
MAP options regarding to MAP0, MAP1 and MAP3. Then, an MN selects an MAP
with certain MAP selection schemes according to the information within these MAP
options. The key design of QMS scheme is Lemma I, which gives a lemma for
estimating the AHD. The AHD is determined by two types of handovers, i.e., interMAP handover and intra-MAP handover which are shown in Fig. 2. Some

2.2 The Lemma for AHD Estimation
Lemma I: Given an M-HMIPv6 network like the one shown in Fig. 1 and handover
process in Fig. 2, assume (1) the session arrival of the MN follows Poisson
distribution, (2) the AR residence time and MAP residence time follow Gamma
distribution with the parameters listed in Table 1, the AHDs of the MAP can be
estimated as (1). In (1), ρ stands for the ratio of λs and λA which is coined SessionMobility-Ratio (SMR) [7], and n is the number of ARs covered by an MAP.

According to Fig. 2, we derive d1 and d2 as follows:

d 2 = TL 2 + 5Twl + δ Ti + 4Tw d AR ↔ MAP + 2Tw d MAP ↔ HA

(5)

According to (4) and (5), we obtain AHD as (6).
AHD = E ( pa d1 + pm d 2 )

(6)

In (6), we can assume that δ is independent with pa and pm, then we rewrite (6) as (7).
AHD = pa (TL 2 + 3Twl +

According to (2) and (3), we deduce pa in (8).

Similarly, pm can be obtained as (9).

Then, take (8) and (9) into (7) and we get (10):

Up to now, we have proved Lemma I. Base on this lemma, we designed the
procedure of QMS scheme as follows.
2.3 Procedure of QMS Scheme
The procedure of QMS scheme is as follows. (1) To obtain the MAP options. When
an MN migrates to an AR, it obtains the MAPs above it from the MAP options within

QoS-Aware MAP Selection Scheme Based on Average Handover Delay

781

the RA messages. (2) To estimate SMR. The MN estimates SMR with the approach
in [7]. (3) To extract the distances and the number of ARs an MAP covers. The MN
obtains the hop number between AR and the available MAPs (dAR↔MAP), the distance
from home agent (HA) to MAP (dHA↔MAP) and the number of ARs from the MAP
option. To achieve this goal, the format of MAP option should be extended to contain
these fields. The hops between HA and MAP can be obtained from routing protocols,
and the number of ARs within one MAP can be obtained by configuration. (4) To
estimate the AHD of each level MAP and select the optimal MAP. The AHDs of the
MAPs in different levels are calculated according to Lemma I and the MAP which
achieves the minimal AHD is selected by the MN. (5) Adaptive load control. If the
optimal MAP is overloaded, then choose the suboptimal one until no MAP is
available. In case of no available MAPs exist, the MN should register to the HA.

3 Numerical Analyses and NS-2 Simulations for QMS Scheme
In this section, we obtain some numerical results based on Lemma I, and conduct
NS-2 simulations to verify the effectiveness of QMS scheme. The topology we used
is shown in Fig. 1.

In (11), dHA↔MAP and dAR↔MAP are determined by which MAP is selected by the
MN. We denote the mean MAP crossing rate of three levels of MAPs as λ1M ~λ3M.
According to [7], we obtain (12).

We plot AHD of different levels of MAPs in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). Fig. 3 (a) is the
whole graph, and Fig. 3 (b) enlarges the part with ρ ranging from 0 to 0.4. We
observe that the optimal AHD is obtained by different levels of MAPs with the
growing of ρ. For example, when ρ equals 0.0125, level-3 MAPs achieve the lowest
AHD. And, when ρ is 0.5, level-1 obtains the optimal AHD.
3.2 NS-2 Simulations
The simulation runs with NS-2.1b6a [15] installed in Redhat Linux 9.0. Robert Hsieh
[4] previously contributed an extension to NS-2 concerning the Fast Handover for
Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (F-HMIPv6) [13] without implementing the MAP discovery
and MAP selection functions in HMIPv6 protocol [2]. We have added the missed
functions according the latest protocol standard [2], and then implement MAP
selection schemes for performance evaluation. To verify the effectiveness of QMS,
we adopt the same network topology which is used for numerical analysis. The
coordinates of the 8 ARs are as follows: (250,250), (375,250), (500,250), (625,250),
(250,375), (375,375), (500,375), (625,375). The radius of the circular area covered
by each AR is 75 m. According to the radius, we set the receive threshold as
3.41828e-8 w (-49.466 dBm) and the transmission power of AR as 0.28183815 w. To
approximate the numerical analysis in the previous section, we set the delay of the
wired links as Table 2. And, the bandwidth of all the wired links is 100 Mbps.
We adopt CBR traffics based on UDP. The CBR traffic is unidirectional and
originated from CN to MN with the bandwidth and packet size as 128 kbps and 512
bytes respectively. We obtain the AHD from UDP traffic which is defined as the
interval from the instant of receiving the last packet at previous AR to the instant of
receiving the first packet at new AR. The call arrival is follows Poisson distribution
and the mobility of the MN simulated by Random Waypoint model [12] generated by
a Java-based scenario program [14]. The simulation time is 10 hours, and the results
are obtained by averaging the statistics over 10 runs.

During the simulation, the MN chooses different level of MAPs in each scenario,
shown in Table 3, and each scenario refers to a sample of ρ. The numerical results of
the samples of ρ are plotted in Fig. 4, and the simulation results of the samples of ρ
are provided in Fig. 5. From Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we observe that the orders of AHDs
incurred by different MAP level from numerical analysis are consistent with the
orders in simulation results for all the scenarios. For example, when ρ equals 0.50,
AHD1<AHD2<AHD3 holds in both simulations and analyses results.

4 Comparison with AMS Through NS-2 Simulations
Since AMS [6] is the most convincing scheme in the literature, we compare the
performance of QMS with AMS in AHD through NS-2 simulations. The topology
and traffic scenarios are the same with that in Section 3.2.
We simulated 120 MNs with different session arrival rates and mobility patterns.
The capacity of the MAPs, i.e., the number of concurrent MNs that can be served by
an MAP, is larger than the number of MNs we simulated. And the AHD in this
section is the mean of handover delay for the sessions of all the MNs, not for only one
MN as defined in previous sections. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 6. We
change the transmission range of the ARs in different scenarios, and the results show
that QMS can effectively reduce the AHD for all the senarios compared with AMS.
The main reason is that it considers the handover delay directly as the criteria for
MAP selection.

5 Conclusion
This paper proposes a novel QMS scheme in M-HMIPv6 networks. Firstly, we
analyze the handover process theoretically and derive a lemma to estimate AHD,
which is the key design of QMS scheme. Then, we verify the analyses by
comparing the numerical results with the statistics from NS-2 simulations.
Moreover, the performance of QMS is compared with AMS, which is considered as
the most convincing MAP selection scheme in the literature. The results show that
QMS outperforms AMS in AHD. The proposed scheme can be applied for
handover optimization for multimedia services in M-HMIPv6 networks. In future
works, we will extend the theoretical analyses to cover more generic mobility
models, and conduct more comprehensive simulations to evaluate the performance
of QMS scheme on other factors, such as location update cost and packet delivery
cost. We will also study how to apply QMS scheme in F-HMIPv6 [13] networks to
achieve better handover performance for multimedia services in M-HMIPv6
networks.
