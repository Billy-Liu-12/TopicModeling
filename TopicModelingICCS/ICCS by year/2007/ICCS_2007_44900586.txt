Abstract. The paper presents the performance comparison between the triangle
routing and the route optimization. The paper presents not only the analytical
models to compare the performance but also the threshold value to decide
whether the mobile node had better use the route optimization or not. The
model provides the approximate guideline when a network administrator is to
implement mobile IPv6 with the route optimization under the given network
environments.

1 Introduction
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed “route optimization” in Mobile IP [1] to solve this “triangle routing” problem [1] that the packets from correspondent node (CN) must be forwarded to the mobile node (MN) via a home agent (HA).
The route optimization enables the packets to be delivered directly between the MN and
the CN. How effective is the route optimization? And will we always need the route
optimization capability when we are to implement Mobile IPv6 under some conditions?
There is no concrete answer for such questions so far [3]. Most of works have not presented the exact quantitative results considering various factors such as the number of
hops between end-to-end host, the network bandwidth, the size of data packets, and the
failure rate of the binding update. Therefore, we propose analytical models to evaluate
the performance of the triangle routing scheme and that of the route optimization
scheme and show the quantitative results of performance comparison.

2 The Proposed Model
Using the triangle routing as shown in Figure 1 (solid line), the packet destined to the
MN is intercepted and tunneled by the HA. The tunneled packet will be forwarded to

after using the BU/BA messages as shown in Figure 1 (dotted line).
Destination Option Header, to include Home Address Option [2], should be added
to the packet routed from the MN to the CN, while Type 2 Routing Header should be
used for the packet routed from the CN to the MN reversely, to carry its home address

Equation (1) shows the total costs for sending a BU message and a BA message.
The retransmission for BU message failure has exponential back-off time and continues until an MN receives a BA or until a maximum (256 seconds) is reached [3]. Consequently, the cost of the routing optimization procedure is obtained by Equation (2).

Equation (4) shows the total delay required when an MN sends packets to a CN
and receives ones from the CN. Equation (5) is obtained by adding the delay required
when an MN sends the tunneled packets to the HA to the delay required when the HA
sends the packets to the CN.

3 The Results of Performance Evaluation
We compare the performance of the routing optimization (RO) scheme and the triangle routing (TR) scheme in terms of the total transmission delay for the messages
using the corresponding routing path. The difference in the numbers of hops between
the MN and the CN with respect to two routing methods is relatively small. For
example, m is 5 or 8 when h+k = 10, because the HA can be switched due to load
balancing.

Figure 2-(a) shows that as the size of the data increases, the delay of TR and that of
RO do. In Figure 2-(b), the larger the size of the bandwidth is, the smaller the total
delay is. Figure 2-(a) provides the threshold values when p=0.99 and wireless bandwidth is 10Mbps. Figure 2-(b) shows that the delay of TR is smaller than that of RO
with the short term packet (1K), when p=0.99 and the bandwidth BWwd ≤ 10Mbps.

4 Conclusion
The paper develops the analytical models to compare the performance of the triangle
routing scheme and the route optimization scheme, considering several important
factors such as the packet type (long or short term) between the MN and the CN, the
number of hops between them, the network bandwidth, and the failure rate of the
binding update procedure. It presents the threshold value to decide whether the MN
should use the route optimization or not under various situations. The model also
provides the approximate guideline when a network administrator is to implement
mobile IPv6 with the route optimization capability.
