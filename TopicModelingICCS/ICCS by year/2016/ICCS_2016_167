Abstract
This research addresses a sequential convex splitting method for numerical simulation of multicomponent two-phase ﬂuids mixture in a single pore at constant temperature, which is modeled
by the gradient theory with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EoS). The gradient theory
of thermodynamics and variational calculus are utilized to obtain a system of chemical equilibrium equations which are transformed into a transient system as a numerical strategy on which
the numerical scheme is based. The proposed numerical algorithm avoids computing Hessian
matrix arising from the second-order derivative of homogeneous contribution of free energy; it
is also quite robust. This scheme is proved to be unconditionally component-wise energy stable.
The Raviart-Thomas mixed ﬁnite element method is applied to spatial discretization.

Introduction

Research on the phenomena occurring in the interface between phases is a hot topic in reservoir engineering and carbon dioxide capturing and sequestration [10, 8, 9, 5, 7] and other
ﬁelds. Phase ﬁeld modeling (is also called diﬀuse interface theory or gradient theory) as one
of methodologies has attracted many scientists and engineers in the literature, for example [1]
and reference therein. In these works, a simple double-well potential is adopted, which can be
qualitatively instead of quantitatively analyzed. For the purpose of more accurate analysis of
interfaces, we need some realistic models, such as the Peng-Robinson EoS [6].
In the paper [4], the authors investigate a multicomponent two-phase system where a linear transformation is utilized to simplify the original system to a decoupled one and then

a semi-implicit time-marching scheme is proposed to the decoupled ﬁnite system. Their approach restricts the time-step size. In the work [7], the gradient theory coupling with the
Peng-Robinson express of Helmholtz free energy is for the ﬁrst time proposed to model the interface in single-component multiphase ﬂuid systems. The authors there proposed a numerical
scheme transforming the original second-order elliptic equations into a corresponding transient
equation; an eﬃcient numerical scheme, so-called convex splitting is established to solve the
transient system.
To our knowledge, it has not been investigated to simulate the multicomponent multiphase
ﬂuid system using some methods based on convex splitting which has some apparent advantages
aforementioned over other methods. In this manuscript, we focus on a component-wise convex
splitting time-marching scheme on the transient partial diﬀerential equations. We ﬁrstly convert
a system of chemical equilibrium equations into a time-dependent version. An adjustment term
is introduced into the transient system. Having this correction term, the free energy can be
split into summation of convex and concave parts and the component-wise convex splitting
scheme is proposed accordingly. For the transient equations, we begin with time-discretization
on any one of the transient partial diﬀerential equations using semi-implicit through convex
splitting combined with mixed ﬁnite element spatial discretization on that equation with all
other components ﬁxed, and thus the solution of the updated time-step is obtained for the chosen
component. Following that, we choose any one of the remainder equations in an analogous way
with the solution of the component obtained from the ﬁrst step. Repeatedly, we obtain the
solutions of all components at the new time-step. This sequentially convex splitting strategy
maintains the property of energy decay in a component-wise way and it naturally leads to the
unconditional energy stability for each time step.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the model problem is stated. In
Section 3, the chemical equilibrium equations are transformed into transient partial diﬀerential
equations by adding time-derivative terms. A component-wise, unconditionally energy decay
time marching procedure and mixed ﬁnite element method is established. The conclusion is
drawn in Section 4.

Modeling Two-phase Multicomponent Systems by Gradient Theory

Consider a multiphase multicomponent ﬂuid system comprising of M components in a container
of invariant volume occupying the domain Ω ⊂ Rd (d = 1, 2, 3) at constant temperature T ; the
gravity is neglected in the current manuscript. Denote by ni the molar density of species
T
T
i. Let n = (n1 , · · · , nM ) = (N1 ,···V,NM ) represent the molar densities of all species and
n = n1 + · · · + nM . Here Ni is molar quantity of species i and V volume of the container.
Based on the gradient theory for the multiphase systems, the total Helmholtz free energy
is composed of two parts: F0 being the thermodynamic theory of homogeneous ﬂuids and F∇
the gradient part of inhomogeneity. The total Helmholtz free energy of the system is given by
F (n) = F0 (n; T, Ω) + F∇ (n; T, Ω) =

f0 (n; T )dx +
Ω

f∇ (n; T )dx.

In the integral, f0 (n; T ), f∇ (n; T ) stand for Helmholtz free energy density of homogeneous ﬂuids and gradient contritution, respectively. For the Peng-Robinson EoS f0 (n) =

In this manuscript, the equilibrium state of the mixture is considered. According to the
thermodynamical theory, at equilibrium the total chemical potential is uniformly invariant in
the whole domain for each species which is mathematically expressed by
μi (x) = constant, ∀x ∈ Ω, i = 1, · · · , M.

Here total chemical potential consists of two parts, homogeneous ﬂuids and the inhomogene∂F0

The system of (2.2) expresses the chemical equilibrium conditions which is a system of coupled

eﬃcient and robust numerical scheme for two-phase multicomponent mixture ﬂuid systems.

Numerical Solutions of Equilibrium Equations

The aforementioned strong nonlinearity in the source term of (2.2) and extremely small value
of cij give rise to big challenge of the numerical solution; even some iterative methods utilized
to solve the algebraic system of spatially discretized PDEs, the stability is still an issue. In the
work by Z. Qiao and S. Sun [7] a strategy that is time-dependent conversion of (2.2) is adopted.

Mixed ﬁnite element approximation for spatial discretization

This section states the Raviart-Thomas mixed ﬁnite element method to spatially discretized the
system (3.3) - (3.6); this method can guarantee local mass conservation as we wish here. The
domain Ω is considered as a two-dimensional domain d = 2 dividing into triangular meshes.
Let Th be the partition of Ω. Denote Γh by the interior edges of Th . There is a ﬁxed unit
normal vector νe for each edge e ∈ Γh ; it is identical with the outward unit normal vector on
d
the boundary of the domain. Deﬁne V ≡ H(Ω; div) ≡ v ∈ L2 (Ω) : divv ∈ L2 (Ω) , W ≡

L2 (Ω). Denote (·, ·) and ·, · Γ by the inner product in u ∈ L2 (Ω) or L2 (Ω) and L2 (Γ),
respectively.
Now a weak formulation considered uniformly for the system of (3.4) - (3.7) is to search for
solution ni ∈ W and ui ∈ V such that:

The Raviart-Thomas space of r−th order (r ≥ 0), RTr , of the partition Th is adopted to

Conclusion

We have studied two-phase ﬂuids consisting of multicomponent mixture at equilibrium state
which are modeled by gradient theory coupled with the Peng-Robinson EoS. This model is
derived according to ﬁrst principle of thermodynamics leading to a system of second-order
elliptic partial diﬀerential equations of molar density. These equations have strongly nonlinear
source terms introduced from the equations of state. The second-order elliptic partial diﬀerential
equations are converted into a time-dependent version by adding a time-derivative term. A
component-wise convex splitting semi-implicit scheme is proposed to solve the transient partial
diﬀerential equations; it discretizes time-derivative in a sequential way. The scheme avoids
computing the Hessian matrices which are diﬃcult to determine whether positive deﬁnite or
not and is numerically eﬃcient. This strategy guarantees the energy decaying for each convex
splitting step of each component. A correction term is plugged into it to take advantage of
the component-wise convex splitting strategy. A constant in this correction term is introduced
and is numerically computed in a dynamical fashion for reducing the error and improving the
convergence rates.
We carried out numerical examples for multicomponent two-phase hydrocarbon systems.
Figure 1 shows the component-wise energy decaying property for the mixture of methane (CH4 )
and n-decane (nC10 H22 ) at temperature of 450 K which veriﬁes the proposed numerical scheme.
Due to the limitation of the ICCS conference manuscript length, some other results for the
examples are omitted here; however, these results will be published separately elsewhere in
near future.
