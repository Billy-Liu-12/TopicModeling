Abstract
This paper shows the use of optimal ﬁlter estimation for real-time data processing to automatically detect dynamic transient eﬀects in phasor data produced in a synchrophasor vector
processing systems. The optimal ﬁlters are estimated on the basis of phasor data where no
disturbances are present and the estimation problem is formulated as a least squares optimization. Event detection bounds are computed from variance estimates and events are detected
by formulating conditions on the number of consecutive samples for which the ﬁltered phasor
signals are outside of the bounds. Event detection is illustrated on the phasor data obtained
from a microPMU system developed by Power Standards Lab.

Grid Monitoring

The intensiﬁcation of distributed renewable energy resources, along with the deployment energy
storage systems to buﬀer intermittent energy production, has motivated the need to monitor
power ﬂow and power quality more accurately in the electricity grid. Complementary to the
traditional Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, synchrophasor vector
processing systems implemented in (protection) relays, digital fault recorders and specialized
Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) can produce time synchronized measurements of 3 phase
AC amplitude and phase angle (phasor) of voltage and currents [2].
The enormous volumes of synchronized time stamped data produced at 60Hz sampling by
PMUs provides a clear challenge for data management and provides new opportunities for power
systems control and protection [13, 14, 3]. Manual observations of PMU data time sequences
to observe trends or possibly detect anomalies in the data quickly becomes a unwieldy task.
It has been recognized that automated or semiautomated data analysis techniques to identify
faults [9], out-of-step conditions [12], power generation anomalies [17], detect PMU data events
on multiple PMUs [20], state estimation [11] and possibly extract (dynamic) knowledge from
such events [18] are highly desirable. Such applications greatly automate the data management

task associated to analyzing PMU data and improve automated grid monitoring capabilities
[10].
Algorithms for calculation of phasors, local system frequency and rate of change of frequency
(RoCoF) that follow the guidelines of the (recent) IEEE Standard C37.118 [4, 8] are abundant.
Especially the accuracy of phasor measurement under dynamic conditions, that include transient eﬀects due to load switching, has been improved by dynamic phasor estimates that use
(weighted) least squares, discrete-time (moving average) ﬁltering and/or advanced algorithms
based on discrete Fourier transforms [2]. Local signal processing (edge processing) of PMU
data that exploits the same computational and processing capabilities of PMUs is important to
reduce the need to transmit high frequency PMU data to a central repository for analysis and
event detection.
This paper describes local synchrophasor based real-time data processing algorithm to automatically detect dynamic transient eﬀects in AC voltage and current signals analyzed by a
synchrophasor vector processing systems. The basic output of the algorithm is the time stamp
when a dynamic event was detected. The approach is based on real-time discrete-time ﬁltering
of phasor data (amplitude and phase angle) to create optimal Filtered Rate of Change (FRoC)
signals for each phasor and postulate an event detection algorithm based on the dynamic response of the FRoC signals. The idea of using phasors directly for event detection has been
addressed in earlier work [5, 16, 15]. However, optimality of the FRoC signals is addressed in
this paper by (recursive) least squares estimation of the parameters of a linear discrete-time
ﬁlter that minimizes the variance of the FRoC signals for both angle and amplitude data of the
phasor for event detection.
It is shown that such optimal ﬁltering of phasor data will lead to FRoC signals that have
much better variance properties than the RoCoF signals based on the rate of change of the
bus frequency [7] produced by the PMU. The smaller variance properties are achieved by the
optimal ﬁlter that estimates the dynamics of the noise on the phasor data due to sensor and
grid dynamics and can be used to detect the start time of dynamic transient eﬀects in phasors
more accurately. For the practical illustration of the algorithm, real-time PMU data acquisition
is implemented on a Raspberry PI computer running Python packages under Linux, receiving
C37.118 format data from the microPMU system [19], developed by Power Standards Lab as
an extension to the well-established low voltage PQube instrumentation by Power Sensors Ltd.
It is shown how real-time processing of the phasor data received by C37.118 can be used for
local event detection on the basis of data obtained during several local events measured by the
microPMU.

2.1

Synchrophasor Data
Synchrophasor Data Representation

To explain the basic terminology and the use of phasor data for event detection, consider a
measurement of a AC signal x(t), which is either a voltage or current signal. In an ideal steadystate operating mode, the signal x(t) is a pure sinusoidal signal x(t) = A cos(2πf t + δ) with an
amplitude A, frequency f , and phase oﬀset δ. Using the phasor representation, the signal x(t)
is represented by the real part of the complex number x(t) = Re{Ae2πf t ejφ } where X = Aejφ
denotes the phasor of x(t).
Although this is an accurate representation of a steady-state sinusoidal signal, any changes
in the signal X(t) with respect to the pure sinusoidal representation would mean that the
amplitude A and frequency f would change with respect to time. To characterize these time
932

variations we may write x(t) = A(t) cos(2πf0 t + φ(t)) where φ(t) = fe (t)t + δ denotes a time
varying phase shift formulated as a time varying frequency error fe (t) with respect to the
nominal frequency f0 of the AC signal x(t). This deﬁnes the (time varying) frequency of the
AC signal as
d

(1)
f (t) = f0 + φ(t) = f0 + fe (t) + t fe (t)

and makes the phasor a time-varying signal
X(t) = A(t)ejφ(t)

(2)

with respect to the nominal AC frequency f0 .

2.2

Rate of Change in Synchrophasor Data

The phasor data (A(t), φ(t)) are estimated and exported by a PMU measuring device at regular
time interval tk = kΔT , where fs = 1/ΔT denotes the sampling frequency. The typical sampling
frequency is given by fs = 60Hz for updates on the phasor at each cycle of an AC sigal x(t)
in an electricity grid with a nominal AC frequency of f0 = 60Hz. The phasor data consisting
of amplitude A(tk ) and phase angle φ(tk ) are communicated, along with an accurate GPS
measurement time tk for data processing.
A popular signal for event detection, also often exported by the PMU, is the rate of change
of frequency (RoCoF) signal
RoCoF (tk ) = 60 · (f (tk ) − f (tk−1 ))

(3)

that can be represented as the discrete-time ﬁltered signal RoCoF (tk ) = F (q)f (tk ) where F (q)
is a discrete-time derivative ﬁlter represented by the “transfer” function
F (q) =

1 − q −1
q−1
=
60
60q

(4)

where q is use to denote the discrete-time shift operator qx(tk ) = x(tk+1 ) and q −1 x(tk ) =
x(tk−1 ). Although the ﬁlter F (q) and the resulting RoCoF signal is indeed a viable signal for
detecting changes in the frequency f (tk ), it is highly susceptible to noise on the actual phase
angle estimate φ(tk ).
It is clear from (1) that diﬀerentiation or a discrete-time derivative of the phase angle φ(tk ) is
required to obtain an estimate of frequency f (tk ), whereas an additional discrete-time derivative
is needed to obtain RoCoF (tk ). A more careful design of the ﬁlter F (q) is needed to obtain
a signal suitable for event detection that is robust to noise on the phase angle estimate φ(tk ).
Furthermore, time varying changes in the phase angle estimate φ(tk ) is only one part of the
phasor. Time varying changes in the amplitude A(tk ) of the phasor X(tk ) in (2) must also be
taken into account to properly detect events.

Signal Processing for Event Detection
Optimal Filtering

To set up the framework for the construction of optimal ﬁlters to process the discrete-time sampled phasor data X(tk ) in (2), we consider an unobservable discrete-time event signal d(tk ). The
933

Optimal Filtering for Grid Event Detection

event signal d(tk ) can only be observed via noisy observations of the phasor data (A(tk ), φ(tk ))
characterized by
A(tk ) = GA (q)d(tk ) + nA (tk )
(5)
φ(tk ) = Gφ (q)d(tk ) + nφ (tk )
where GA (q) and Gφ (q) denote unknown dynamic systems that ﬁlter the eﬀect of the common
event signal d(tk ) on both the amplitude A(tk ) and phase φ(tk ) of the phasor X(tk ). The noise
nA (tk ), nφ (tk ) on the signals in (5) is characterized by ﬁltered white noise signals
nA (tk )
nφ (tk )

=
=

HA (q)eA (tk )
Hφ (q)eφ (tk )

(6)

where HA (q) and Hφ (q) denote unknown dynamic systems that model ﬁlter the white noises
eA (tk ), eφ (tk ) and model the spectral content of the output noise on the data in (5). As such,
we may assume that HA (q) and Hφ (q) are spectral factorizations of the noise spectrum and
are stable and stably invertible ﬁlters [1]. We assume that the white noises eA (tk ), eφ (tk ) are
uncorrelated with an unknown variance without loss of generality to formulate the estimation
problem of the optimal ﬁlters to process the phasor data (A(tk ), φ(tk )).
To illustrate the idea of optimal ﬁltering, we consider the amplitude signal A(tk ) only, as
the approach to ﬁlter φ(tk ) will be similar. Formulating a ﬁltering FA (q) of the amplitude data
ˆ
A(tk ) leads to the estimate d(k)
= F (q)A(tk ) = F (q)GA (q)d(tk ) + F (q)HA (q)eA (tk ) where it
can be observed that choosing FA (q) = GA (q)−1 would lead to a perfectly constructed event
signal d(tk ), but susceptible to a ﬁltered noise signal F (q)HA (q)eA (tk ) that may be arbitrary
bad. Furthermore, such a choice is only possible if the dynamics GA (q) is known and invertible.
An example of this approach is the choice of the ﬁlter F (q) for the RoCoF signal in (4), where
an attempt is made to approximate the inverse of integration (diﬀerentiation) to process a
step-wise change in the bus frequency due, resulting in high frequency noise ampliﬁcation.
Instead, choosing FA (q) = HA (q)−1 would lead to
dˆA (tk ) = F (q)GA (q)d(tk ) + eA (tk )

(7)

and constitutes a ﬁltered version of the event signal d(tk ) perturbed by only a white noise
signal. The properties of a white noise signal can now be used to formulate an event detection
ˆ k ) over time.
algorithm that exploits the correlation between subsequent measurements of d(t
More details on the actual event detection will be given in the next section, ﬁrst we focus on
the construction of the ﬁlter FA (q) = HA (q)−1 .
The possibility to choose a ﬁlter FA (q) = HA (q)−1 is motivated by the fact that HA (q) is
a spectral realization of the spectrum of the noise nA (tk ) in (5). It is well known that such
a ﬁlter HA (q) can always be realized by stable and stably invertible ﬁlters FA (q) = HA (q)−1
[1], guaranteeing the existence of the stable ﬁlter FA (q). As HA (q) is unknown, we proposed
two crucial steps to compute a ﬁlter FA (q) that is able to approximate the inverse of the noise
dynamics HA (q):
1. Select N data points of phasor data of A(tk ) where no event was present, e.g. d(tk ) = 0.
2. Select an (optional) ﬁlter LA (q) to ﬁlter the phasor amplitude data. The ﬁlter LA (q)
is used to emphasize certain frequency ranges where event detection is important. For
example, a high pass ﬁlter LA (q) will avoid detection of oﬀsets on the amplitude A(tk ).
The selection of N data points where no event is present in step 1 can be by manual
inspection of the data or based on the event detection algorithm summarized later. Clearly,
934

Optimal Filtering for Grid Event Detection

this ﬁrst step is required for the initialization and calibration of the event detection algorithm.
The ability to include a user-speciﬁed ﬁlter LA (q) in step 2 above provides an extra design step
in the event detection. In addition, a carefully designed ﬁlter LA (q) can make the approximation
of the inverse of the noise dynamics more easier to achieve. With the help of the two steps
above, (7) reduces to
dˆA (tk ) = FA (q)LA (q)A(tk ) = FA (q)LA (q)HA (q)eA (tk )

(8)

where is can be observed that an approximation of the inverse of the (ﬁltered) noise dynamics
LA (q)HA (q) by FA (q) would now lead to a white noise dˆA (tk ). Parametrizing the ﬁlter FA (q)
in an Moving Average format
FA (q) = 1 − f1 q −1 − f2 q −1 − · · · − fn q −1

Event Detection on Phasor Data from a μPMU

4.1

Data collection from micro-PMU system

The Power Standards Lab (PSL) micro-PMU (μPMU) [19] includes a PQube instrument that
contains measurement, recording, and communication functionalities along with a remotelymounted micro GPS receiver, and a power supply. These devices can be connected to single- or
three phase secondary distribution circuits up to 690V (line-to-line) or 400V (line-to-neutral),
either into standard outlets or through potential transformers (PTs). The devices continuously
sample AC voltage and current waveforms at 256 or 512 samples per cycle and can produce 3
phase phasor data X(tk ) at sampling rates of 60 or 120 Hz.
The phasor data data is streamed in real-time to a client computer using IEEE C37.118
standard over the Ethernet using TCP port 4713. The client computer used for data acquisition
here is a Raspberry PI model B+ that acts as an interface between the data source (μPMU) and
the data archive server (OSIsoft server). An overview of the hardware setup used for real-time
C37.118 data acquisition from the μPMU into the Raspberry PI is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Hardware setup for data processing and archival.
Due to the ﬂexible computing environment on the Raspberry PI, real-time event detection
can directly be implemented via Python. Socket programming is used to read data from the
TCP port 4713 in a predeﬁned frame-size. The μPMU-Raspberry PI act as a server-client
application that communicate C37.118 data using sockets.

4.2

Decoding the C37.118 Data in Real-time

A popular way to process C37.118 data is the use of OpenPDC1 by Grid Protection Alliance
(GPA), but here we decode data directly in the Python application used to read data from the
TCP port 4713. The Synchrophasor measurements are tagged with the UTC time corresponding
to the time of measurement usually consisting of three numbers: a second-of-century (SOC)
count, a fraction-of-second (FRACSEC) count, and a message time quality ﬂag as in [4]. The
synchrophasor consists of four message types: data, conﬁguration, header, and command. The
ﬁrst three message types are transmitted from the μPMU that serves as the data source, and
the last (command) is received by the μPMU. All message frames start with a 2-byte SYNC
word then followed by FRAMESIZE word (2-byte), IDCODE (2-byte), a time stamp consisting

937

of a second-of-century (SOC, 4-byte)2 and FRACSEC (4-byte), which includes a FRACSEC
integer (24-bit) and a Time Quality ﬂag (8-bit).

Figure 2: Data frame byte transmission of C37.118 data
The SYNC word provides synchronization and frame identiﬁcation. The IDCODE positively
identiﬁes the source of a data, header, or conﬁguration message, or the destination of a command
message. All data frames terminate in check word (CHK) which is a CRC-CCITT. This CRCCCITT uses the generating polynomial X16 + X12 + X5 + 1 with an initial value of 1 (hex
FFFF) and no ﬁnal mask. All frames are transmitted exactly as described with no delimiters
and an illustration of an example frame transmission order is shown in Fig.2.

Application of event detection

For demonstration purposes, single phasor voltage amplitude A(tk ) and angle φ(tk ) data are
collected from the Engineering Building at UCSD via a μPMU. The data used for demonstration
of event detection was collected over the course of 48 hours at 60Hz sampling (approx. 106 data
points) while a tornado warning was issued in San Diego in the afternoon of January 6, 2016.

Although there are other “spikes” seen in the data, these do not signify the detect events
as they do not satisfy the event detection criteria. These events signify the disturbances on the
grid that can explicitly be seen on the phasors of the power signal.

Conclusions and Future Work

Optimal ﬁlters which can be used to formulate ﬁltered rate of change phasor signals can be
estimated on the basis of phasor data where no disturbances are present via a straight-forward
least squares optimization. The resulting variance bounds give rise to event detection algorithms
that check for the number of consecutive samples for which the ﬁltered phasor signals are outside
the variance bounds. The resulting procedure is applied to actual phasor measurement data
obtained from a microPMU system developed by Power Standards Lab and shows realistic
event detection for various frequency (angle) and voltage disturbance events. Our future work
will implement the event detection algorithm in real-time, either in the PMU ﬁrmware or an
external client computer, to monitor and automatically detect events in the electricity grid.
