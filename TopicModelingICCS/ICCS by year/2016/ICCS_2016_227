Abstract
This paper extends FARSITE (a software used for wildﬁre modeling and simulation) to incorporate data assimilation techniques based on noisy and limited spatial resolution observations
of the ﬁre perimeter to improve the accuracy of wildﬁre spread predictions. To include data
assimilation in FARSITE, uncertainty on both the simulated ﬁre perimeter and the measured
ﬁre perimeter is used to formulate optimal updates for the prediction of the spread of the wildﬁre. For data assimilation, ﬁre perimeter measurements with limited spatial resolution and a
known uncertainty are used to formulate an optimal adjustment in the ﬁre perimeter prediction.
The adjustment is calculated from the Kalman ﬁlter gain in an Ensemble Kalman ﬁlter that
exploits the uncertainty information on both the simulated ﬁre perimeter and the measured ﬁre
perimeter. The approach is illustrated on a wildﬁre simulation representing the 2014 Cocos ﬁre
and presents comparison results for hourly data assimilation results.

Introduction

As wildﬁre occurrence has increased over the last several decades, so too has interest in the
modeling of wildﬁre behavior. Wildﬁre modeling involves the numerical simulation of wildﬁres
in order to understand the properties and predict the ﬁre behavior. A software widely used
for this purpose by the U.S Forest Service and other federal and state agencies is FARSITE
[8]. While FARSITE’s rate of ﬁre spread model is sophisticated, it should be noted that it
does not incorporate any stochastic aspects when simulating the actual wildﬁre. Simulations in
FARSITE, under a given set of inputs and parameters and without the probabilistic generation
of embers, is largely a deterministic process. FARSITE also does not possess any features for
incorporating noisy and ﬁnite spatial resolution measurements of the ﬁre perimeter during the
simulation and thus has no data assimilation capabilities.

Wildﬁre Spread Prediction and Assimilation for FARSITE

Thayjes Srivas et al.

The use of data assimilation techniques in wildﬁre spread models is an active ﬁeld of research [13, 14]. Due to the highly large-scale spatial-temporal simulations required in wildﬁre
simulation, merging simulations and measurements may use Monte Carlo methods for data
assimilation techniques [23]. Other approach provided detailed models of the wildﬁre in interaction with the atmosphere [12] where Tikhonov regularization is used to avoid nonphysical
states. Some of the most recent data assimilation techniques for wildﬁre spread prediction
[18, 17] heavily rely on Ensemble Kalman ﬁltering [7, 9, 3, 11] also use in many earth science
applications [6]. Although most of these methods can assimilate gridded data, the use of noisy
and ﬁnite spatial resolution measurements via the explicit incorporation of uncertainty in both
the simulate and measured ﬁre perimeter for optimal adjustment of the predicted ﬁre perimeter
is often overlooked. Existing methods use a ﬁxed dimension of the state, representing a ﬁnite
number of points on the ﬁre perimeter, during the assimilation process. The methodology in
this paper allows the dimension of the state to increase, improving resolution of ﬁre perimeters
that tend to grow larger in size over time.
The aim of this paper is to include data assimilation on the ﬁre perimeters in FARSITE
via standard ensemble averaging and optimal adjustments via Kalman ﬁlter computations.
Uncertainty on both the simulated ﬁre perimeter and the measured ﬁre perimeter is used to
formulate optimal updates for the prediction of the spread of the wildﬁre. For that purpose, the
estimate of the initial ﬁre perimeter is augmented with a conﬁdence region that is characterized
by a covariance matrix. Ensemble sampling based on the mean and covariance information
is then used to propagate the uncertainty through FARSITE for a stochastic update of the
wildﬁre spread simulation. Although FARSITE also allows for the use of adjustment factors
to alter wildﬁre spread for diﬀerent fuel types [5], only adjustment on ﬁre perimeters are used.
Fire perimeter measurements with limited spatial resolution and a known uncertainty are used
to to formulate an optimal adjustment in the ﬁre perimeter prediction. The adjustment is
calculated from the Kalman ﬁlter gain in an Ensemble Kalman ﬁlter that exploit the uncertainty
information on both the simulated ﬁre perimeter and the measured ﬁre perimeter.

FARSITE
Forward Model for Wildﬁre Simulations

FARSITE [8], largely based on Rothermel’s model [19], is widely used by the U.S. Forest Service
as an eﬀective tool of simulating the growth of natural ﬁres in wilderness areas. It can be seen
as a dedicated forward-prediction model taking the form of equation 1 which uses spatial and
temporal information on the parameters θk and driving inputs uk to predict a ﬁre perimeter on
a two-dimensional plane, denoted by x
¯k+1|k .
x
ˆk+1|k = f (ˆ
xk|k , θk , uk )
yˆk+1|k = Ck+1 x
ˆk+1|k

(1)

For the considered wildﬁre data assimilation, the (measured) output yk+1 refers to a spatially downsampled (coarse) measurement of the actual ﬁre perimeter, whereas wildﬁre related
parameters θk may include topography and fuel parameters, and driving input uk can refer to
weather and wind conditions.
The FARSITE function f (·) in (1) is an implicit and high dimensional forward model that
models ﬁre growth via a vector approach and includes ﬁre behavior models for surface ﬁre
spread [19], crown ﬁre initiation [22], crown ﬁre spread [20] and dead fuel moisture [4, 15].
Furthermore, the dimension nk of the two-dimensional perimeter x
ˆk−1|k−1 ∈2nk−1 typically
898

Wildﬁre Spread Prediction and Assimilation for FARSITE

changes to nk ≥ nk−1 for x
ˆk|k−1 over the course of the ﬁre simulation. The implicit knowledge of the forward model f (·) and changing dimension of the state x
ˆk|k−1 makes FARSITE
and ideal application candidate for ensemble based state estimation to extend FARSITE with
data assimilation capabilities to improve wildﬁre simulation and any success in this regard will
enhance the FARSITE-based data assimilation capabilities for improved wildﬁre simulation.

2.2

FARSITE data inputs

FARSITE requires an input parameters set that describes the environment where the wildﬁre
is taking place. The parameters can be classiﬁed depending on variability of such values in
time and/or space. The static values (which varies mostly spatially) describing the topography,
are raster maps which are combined in one single ﬁle known as FARSITE landscape ﬁle. This
ﬁle contains digital elevation model information as slope, elevation or aspect as well as the
description of the vegetation land cover and the fuel map [1], [2], [21].
The ignition boundary is introduced into FARSITE in a vectorial ﬁle format. In such vectorial format, some input parameters as the ﬁre line intensity(FLI) and the rate of spread(ROS)
for each point of the boundary are included. Finally, the time varying parameters are mostly
weather values. This Linux FARSITE version uses a brief daily description of the weather
except for the wind values. Those values are introduced every 10 minutes using a gridded format ﬁle. In this manner, an important parameter for wildﬁres as the wind could be updated
frequently.
The weather information used in this work has been obtained from weather stations of
the High Performance Wireless Network for Education and Research (HPWREN) [16, 10].
HPWREN allows requesting data in real time from the most near station to the centroid of the
initial ﬁre perimeter. The weather data is obtained in XML format and the request is parsed
and written for FARSITE.

Ensemble Kalman Filter with FARSITE

The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [7] is a Monte-Carlo implementation of the Bayesian
update problem. Given a probability distribution of the system (the prior) and measurement
likelihood, the Bayes theorem is used to to obtain the probability distribution with the data
taken into account (the posterior). The state estimate is the mean of the posterior distribution.
The data likelihood is the conditional probability distribution of the measurement given the
current state. The EnKF assumes a Gaussian Distribution for the state variables implying that
the state can be entirely characterized by the mean and the covariance of the ensemble.

3.1

Forward simulations

Unlike the Kalman Filter which uses linear equations to propagate the mean and covariance in
time, the EnKF propagates the uncertainty by advancing each ensemble member through the
forward model. This advantage of the EnKF provides an incentive to use it in high spatialtemporal simulations such as the FARSITE simulation software. For a brief overview of using
the EnKF in FARSITE, consider the following computational steps [9]:
1. Initialize the distribution by deﬁning a mean and a covariance of the state.

xk|k ∼ (¯

xk|k ∈ Rnk .

2. Generate the ensembles by sampling from this distribution.
Xk|k = (x1k|k , x2k|k , x3k|k , .., xN
k|k ),

Xk|k ∈ Rnk ×N

We now deﬁne the ensemble perturbation/error matrix Exk|k

3. Advance each ensemble member through the forward model (FARSITE)
xik+1|k = f (xik|k , uk ),

i = 1, 2, . . . , N,

xk+1|k ∈ Rnk+1

(3)

4. Calculate the mean and sample covariance of the forward ensemble. The mean is calculated simply by taking an average of the members of the forward ensemble. The sample
x
, which can

We will now shortly describe how the above variables and steps are deﬁned and carried out
in a wildﬁre data and assimilation context using FARSITE. The mean x

state which describes the ignition boundary (initial ﬁre perimeter) in eastern ei and northern

n0|0 × n0|0 covariance matrix of the state x
that relates x
¯0|0 to the vector xc = [ec nc ]T via x
¯0|0 = A[ec nc ]T .
Describing the initial state covariance matrix as in (5) allows us to maintain the overall shape
and size of the ignition boundary while still giving us freedom to impose a large uncertainty on
xc
on the center point
the actual location of the ignition boundary via a covariance matrix P0|0
T
xc = [ec nc ] . Having deﬁned the initial mean and covariance matrix, step 2 is implemented by
simply sampling from a normal distribution described by tits mean and covariance. Each of the
ensemble members xik|k constitutes an independent ignition boundary which is used to compute
an update ensemble xik+1|k through a forward model (FARSITE) simulation. The simulations
in (3) can be carried out in parallel n order to increase computational speed. Note that each
of the runs use the same parametric and input conditions during the FARSITE simulation.

Fire Perimeter Adjustment Using Observations

The output perimeters xik+1|k obtained from the forward model (FARSITE) simulation constitute the members of the forward/forecasted ensemble. These forward perimeters are generally
vectors with a size diﬀerent and larger than the initial size n00|0 . Furthermore, at each time time
step k + 1, the output perimeters xik+1|k may even have diﬀerent sizes n1k+1|k , n2k+1|k , . . . , nN
k+1|k
depending on the ensemble xik|k used to compute xik+1|k . To allow state updates with the EnKF
approach for a varying state dimension, each new output perimeters xik+1|k is re-interpolated
in 2D (eastern/northern) to a new size
nk+1|k = max(n1k+1|k , n2k+1|k , . . . , nN
k+1|k )
in order to preserve resolution at each time step k + 1. Finally the mean x
¯k+1|k and sample cox
are calculated using the interpolated output perimeters of the forward ensemble
variance Pk+1|k
and allow us to continue the computational steps for data assimilation as follows.
5. We now deﬁne the distribution of observations with a mean, yk+1 ∈ Rm and the observation covariance matrix, Vk+1 ∈ Rm×m and generate the ensemble of observations by
sampling from this distribution:

N
Yk+1|k = (yk+1|k

and the ensemble of perturbations/error for the observations:

The sample covariance of the observations and sample cross covariance between the state

ˆk+1|k+1 , is the mean of
the ensemble, x

For the continued iteration along the time index k, one replace k →
− k + 1 and repeat steps
2 to 8. The above steps can be described in context for wildﬁre data assimilation. It is clear
that yk+1 in in step 5 is deﬁned as the downsampled version of the “true” ﬁre perimeters given
by yk+1 = Ck+1 xk+1 where Ck+1 is the spatial downsampling matrix and xk+1 is the true (yet
unknown) state data of the ﬁre perimeter.
At this step we also introduce the observation covariance matrix Vk+1 . In the wildﬁre context, this characterizes the variance on our measurements of the ﬁre perimeters yk+1 . The mean
and covariance matrix of the observations allows us to apply uncertainty on our measurements
which is very important in calculating the Kalman gain Kk+1 in step 6. In the next step we
update each of our interpolated perimeters, xik+1|k which we obtained from the output of the
FARSITE, using the Kalman gain and a sample measurement from the ensemble of observations. The ensemble of observations is characterized by its mean yk+1 and covariance matrix
Vk+1 described earlier. These updated perimeters xik+1|k+1 are the ﬁre perimeters which will
be used to resume our simulation from the k + 1th time step. In the remaining steps we do a
similar calculation as in the ﬁrst 4 steps and obtain the updated mean of the ﬁre perimeters

Application in WildFire Data Assimilation
Reference Data for Simulation

In this section we collect topography data and weather conditions from the May 2014 Cocos Fire
in San Marcos and use this to generate parametric conditions and input data for a FARSITE
wildﬁre simulation. These parametric conditions and input data are used to produce the “true”
ﬁre perimeters xk+1 that will be used as a reference for the performance evaluation of the data
assimilation tools in this paper. The simulated ﬁre perimeters are depicted in Fig. 1 over a
18 hour time period with a one hour time resolution and a 90m spatial resolution along the
perimeter, starting from a given square 30m×30m ignition boundary x0 at t = k = 0.
For testing the data assimilation tools, the “true” data with a 90m spatial resolution along
the perimeter is down-sampled to generate the output yk+1 by
yk+1 = Ck+1 xk+1 + vk+1 ,
where Ck+1 is a downsampling matrix, and measurements yk+1 are produced at a spatial
resolution of only 360m along the perimeter. The measurements are perturbed by a white noise
vk+1 with a standard deviation of 50m. In addition, it is assumed that the ignition boundary
x0 is not known at the start of the data assimilation procedure. Instead, an initial estimate
x
ˆ0|0 = x0 along with a covariance matrix is used.

4.2

Forward Simulation Without Data Assimilation

To illustrate the need for data assimilation, a forward simulation from FARSITE is initialized
at x
ˆ0 = x0 . The ignition boundary (initial ﬁre perimeter) x
ˆ0 is also characterized by a square
30 × 30m ﬁre perimeter, but with the center of the perimeter 215m oﬀ in eastern direction and
730m oﬀ in in northern direction compared to the “true” x0 . A side-by-side comparison can
be made between the reference data (the “true” ﬁre perimeters) xk+1 in Fig. 1 and the ﬁre
ˆ0 = x0 in
perimeters x
ˆk+1 obtained by the forward simulation from FARSITE initialized at x
Fig. 2. It is clear that the relatively small initial error due to x
ˆ0 = x0 between the initial ﬁre
perimeters leads to a growing divergence of the ﬁre perimeters over time.

perimeter is used for data assimilation.

where nk is the state size, representing the number of points on the ﬁre perimeter. Evaluating
the RMS error for the forward simulation of hourly ﬁre perimeters x
ˆk shown earlier in Fig. 2,
leads to the progress of the RMS error summarized in Fig. 3. It is clear from this ﬁgure
that a simple forward simulation with FARSITE, without the corrections provided by data
assimilation, does not improve the RMS error and eventually leads to a diverging RMS error.
Data assimilation is needed to stabilize the RMS error and correct for the initial error in the
ﬁre perimeter x
ˆ 0 = x0 .

Data Assimilation with Hourly Updates

Using noisy and down-sampled measurements yk+1 at time index k + 1, an estimate x
ˆk+1|k+1 is
formulated of the “true” ﬁre perimeter xk+1 via the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF) approach
outlined earlier in Section 3. To initialize the data assimilation procedure, the same inaccurate

During the subsequent steps of the EnKF method outlined in Section 3, the comparison of
the updated perimeter and the perimeter of the reference ﬁre along with a conﬁdence region
on one of the coordinates of the reference ﬁre is depicted in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the
predicted and reference ﬁre perimeter converge fairly quickly. This is also conﬁrmed by the plot

of the RMS Error convergence rate for this simulation in Fig. 5. Clearly the error decreases by
a very large amount in the ﬁrst update and then decreases by only small amounts in subsequent
updates, showing the quick convergence and eﬀectiveness of the data assimilation technique to
account for errors in the initial ﬁre perimeter.

4.4

Eﬀect of Measurement Uncertainty on Convergence Rate

For the hourly updates, the convergence was shown to occur in only a single update step of the
EnKF algorithm, despite the error on the initial ﬁre perimeter. The fast convergence is due to
the relatively large covariance on the initial ﬁre perimeter and relatively small covariance on
the ﬁre perimeter observations. Next we investigate the eﬀect of varying this uncertainty in
the measurements of the reference ﬁre perimeter on the convergence rate. The simulation is
initialized with a smaller initial uncertainty to see a more pronounced eﬀect of this variation.
We apply the same covariance matrix on the coordinates of the mean perimeter and then give a
smaller 2×2 covariance matrix for the center of the ignition boundary compared to the previous

From Fig. 6 we can clearly see that the simulation that uses ﬁre perimeter observations
with a 40000m2 variance would take a larger number of steps to converge to the same error
when compared to the simulation which uses more accurate ﬁre perimeter observations with a
2500m2 variance.

4.5

Data Assimilation with Reduced Update Frequency

To complete the analysis of the EnKF ﬁlter for data assimilation performance, we repeat the
procedure with the same initial ﬁre perimeter and covariance matrices as used in the simulation
presented in Section 4.3. For performance evaluation we now plot the (mean) RMS Error and
the variance of the RMS Error during the course of the simulation. In this case the assimilation
steps occur do not occur hourly, but are further apart. Compared to Figure 4, data assimilation
is only done at the time steps k = 1 and k = 4 instead of every hourly time step. The results
in Figure 7 show the eﬀect of both the mean and variance of the RMS error and indicate a
signiﬁcant drop in the mean RMS error and its variance whenever a data assimilation step is
performed. Even though the mean RMS error does not increase considerably when no data
assimilation step is performed, the uncertainty does increase signiﬁcantly during time steps
without data assimilation. This large uncertainty in the RMS error informs us that even though
the (mean) RMS error itself may remain small between the reference and oﬀset perimeters, the
uncertainty on the ﬁre perimeter may grow without frequent data assimilation steps.

Conclusions and Future Work

Data assimilation in FARSITE is accomplished by characterizing both simulated and actual
measured ﬁre perimeter with a mean and covariance matrix (conﬁdence regions) to formulate
optimal updates for the prediction of the spread of the wildﬁre. Optimal updates are computed
via a ﬁre perimeter adjustment, weighted by a Kalman ﬁlter gain that is computed via an
Ensemble Kalman ﬁlter approach. Application of the proposed FARSITE data assimilation to
a wildﬁre simulation representing the 2014 Cocos ﬁre conﬁrmed an inverse relation between the
rate of convergence of the ﬁre perimeter and the uncertainty on the ﬁre perimeter measurements.
In the presence of incorrect ignition boundary, it is shown that convergence to the actual wild
ﬁre perimeter is obtained in only a few data assimilation steps in case of a relatively small
(50m) standard deviation on the measured ﬁre perimeters measured at a resolution of 360m.
The simulation study also includes results on convergence for larger uncertainty in the measured
ﬁre perimeters and when data assimilation steps are not performed regularly. State updates
only involved the ﬁre perimeter and future work will extend this to fuel adjustment factors used
in FARSITE to account for wildﬁre spread variations over homogeneous fuel types.
