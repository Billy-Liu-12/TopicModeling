Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model to describe the nanoparticles transport carried
by a two-phase ﬂow in a porous medium including gravity, capillary forces and Brownian diﬀusion. Nonlinear iterative IMPES scheme is used to solve the ﬂow equation, and saturation and
pressure are calculated at the current iteration step and then the transport equation is solved
implicitly. Therefore, once the nanoparticles concentration is computed, the two equations of
volume of the nanoparticles available on the pore surfaces and the volume of the nanoparticles
entrapped in pore throats are solved implicitly. The porosity and the permeability variations
are updated at each time step after each iteration loop. Numerical example for regular heterogenous permeability is considered. We monitor the changing of the ﬂuid and solid properties
due to adding the nanoparticles. Variation of water saturation, water pressure, nanoparticles
concentration and porosity are presented graphically.

Introduction

Recently, applications of nanoparticles (1-100 nm) have been reported in petroleum industry
such as oil and gas exploration and production that become a promising ﬁeld of research. In
general, the sizes of PN are in the range of 10 − 500 nm, while pore radii of a porous medium
(sandstone) are from 6 to 6.3 × 104 nm. However, if a particle larger than a pore throat may
block at the pore throat during nanoparticles transport with ﬂow in the porous medium. There
are certain types of nanoparticles, such as polysilicon nanoparticles (PN), can be used in oilﬁelds
to enhance water injection by changing the wettability through their adsorption on porous walls.
The PN may be classiﬁed based on wettability of their surfaces into two types,namely:

(1) Lipophobic and hydrophilic PN and exists in water phase only.
(2) Hydrophobic and lipophilic PN and exists only in the oil phase.
In [18, 17] authors have founded a mathematical model of nanoparticles transport in twophase ﬂow in porous media based on the formulation of ﬁne particles transport in two-phase ﬂow
in porous media provided in Refs. [21]. El-Amin et al. [9, 8, 11] introduced a model to simulate
nanoparticles transport in two-phase ﬂow in porous media. In [12, 10], authors extended the
model to include a negative capillary pressure and mixed relative permeabilities correlations
to ﬁt with the mixed-wet system. The model of ﬂow and transport of nanoparticles in porous
media consists mainly of ﬁve PDEs, namely, pressure, saturation, nanoparticles concentration,
volume of the nanoparticles available on the pore surfaces , and ﬁnally the volume of the
nanoparticles entrapped in pore throats. Moreover, the model includes variations of both
porosity and permeability due to nanoparticles precipitation on the pores walls of the medium.
The model of two-phase ﬂuid ﬂow in porous media is a coupled system of nonlinear timedependent partial diﬀerential equations. Two diﬀerent types of time discretization schemes
are often used to solve this coupled system. The ﬁrst one is the fully implicit scheme [2, 6,
7] that implicitly treats with all terms including capillary pressure. This scheme results in
a system of nonlinear equations and has unconditional stability and maintains the inherent
coupling of two-phase ﬂow model. The second scheme is the IMplicit-EXplicit (IMEX) [1, 3,
13, 16] which generally treats the linear terms implicitly and evaluates the others explicitly, and
consequently. This scheme is conditionally stable, however, it has advantage that is to eliminate
the nonlinearity of original equations. The IMplicit Pressure Explicit Saturation (IMPES)
approach is viewed as an IMEX method, solves the pressure equation implicitly and updates the
saturation explicitly. The IMPES method is conditionally stable, and hence it must take very
small time step size, especially for highly heterogeneous permeable media where the capillary
pressure aﬀects substantially on the path of ﬂuid ﬂow. The instability of the IMPES method
[5] results from the decoupling between the pressure equation and the saturation equation as
well as the explicit treatment of the capillary pressure. The IMPES for two-phase ﬂow has been
improved in several versions (e.g. [4]). As an iterative method, the computational cost and
memory required by iterative IMPES method is smaller than the fully coupled approach at each
iterative step, which is more pronounced for very large size computational problems. The main
disadvantage of iterative IMPES method is the decoupling of pressure and saturation equations,
which results from the explicit treatment for capillary pressure. A linear approximation of
capillary function is introduced to couple the implicit saturation equation into pressure equation
[19]. Kou and Sun [20] presented an iterative version of their previous scheme proposed in [19].
Unlike iterative IMPES, capillary pressure is not computed by the saturations at the previous
iteration, but the linear approximation of capillary function at the current iteration is used,
which is constructed by the saturations at the current and previous iterations.
In this work, we use the iterative IMPES scheme introduced in [20, 19] to solve the ﬂow
equation of the model of nanopaticles transport in porous media. Then, we used the saturation and pressure calculated at the current iteration step to calculate the transport equation
implicitly. Therefore, once we compute the nanoparticles concentration, the two equations of
volume of the nanoparticles available on the pore surfaces and the volume of the nanoparticles
entrapped in pore throats are solved implicitly. In our scheme, we update the porosity and the
permeability variations at each time step after each iteration loop.

Modeling and Mathematical Formulation

2.1

Two-phase ﬂow Model

In this section, a mathematical model is developed to describe the nanoparticles transport
carried by two-phase ﬂow in porous media. Let us consider two-phase immiscible incompressible
ﬂow in a heterogeneous porous medium domain governed by the Darcys law and the equations
of mass conservation for each phase as,
∂ (φSα )
+ ∇ · u α = qα ,
∂t
uα = −

krα
K (∇pα + ρα g) ,
μα

α = w, n.

α = w, n.

(1)

(2)

where Sα is the saturation, uα is the velocity of the phase α. w stands for the wetting phase,
and n stands for the nonwetting phase. φ is the porosity of the medium, qα is the external mass
ﬂow rate. K is the absolute permeability tensor is chosen as K = kI, where I is the identity
matrix and k is a positive real number. krα is the relative permeability, ρα is the density, and
pα is the pressure of the phase α, g = (0, −g)T is the gravitational acceleration. μα is the
viscosity and kα = krα K is the eﬀective permeability. The ﬂuid saturations for the wetting and
non-wetting are interrelated by,
Sw + Sn = 1.
(3)
Now, we describe the governing equations used in [15] and [20] as,
∇ · (ua + uc ) ≡ −∇ · λt K∇Φw − ∇ · λn K∇Φc = qw + qn .

(4)

and

∂ (φSα )
− qw = −∇ · (fw ua ) ≡ −∇ · λt K∇Φw .
(5)
∂t
where fw = λw /λt is the ﬂow fraction, λα = krα /μα is the mobility, Φw = pw + ρw g is the
water pressure potential, and Φc = pc + (ρn − ρw ) g is the capillary pressure potential. The
total velocity ut = uw + un = ua + uc is deﬁned as the sum of the two velocity variables
ua = −λt K∇Φw and uc = −λn K∇Φc . The wetting-phase velocity may be expressed by,
uw = fw ua . The two-phase capillary pressure can be expressed by, pc (Sw ) = pn − pw .

2.2

Nanoparticles Transport Model

Ju and Fan [18] reported that there are two types of polysillicon nanoparticles (PN) can be used
in oil ﬁelds to improve oil recovery and enhance water injection, respectively. The polysillicon
nanoparticles are classiﬁed based on wettability of the surface of the PN. The ﬁrst type is called
lipophobic and hydrophilic polysillicon nanoparticles (LHPN) and exists in water phase only,
while the second type is called hydrophobic and lipophilic polysillicon nanoparticles (HLPN)
and exists in the oil phase only. The sizes of PN are in the range of 10 to 500 nm, therefore,
Brownian diﬀusion is considered. Assuming that we have a number m of size interval of the
nanoparticles in water phase, the transport equation for each size interval i of the nanoparticles
in the water/oil phase can be written as,
∂ (φSα Ci,α )
+ uα · ∇Ci,α = ∇ · (φSα Di,α ∇Ci,α ) − Ri,α + Qi,α .
∂t
1346

(6)

An Iterative Implicit Scheme for Nanoparticles . . .

El-Amin, Kou, Sun and Salama

where i = 1, 2, , m. Ci,α is the volume concentrations of nanoparticles in size interval i in the
phase α.
Nanoparticles that have sizes smaller than microns have strong Brownian motion, and can
bring nanoparticles very close to the pore wall. Therefore, nanoparticle may retention to decrease as ﬂow velocity increases. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient Di of the nanoparticle can be calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation,
Di =

kB T
,
3πμdρ

(7)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T absolute temperature, dρ is the particle diameter, and μ
is the ﬂuid viscosity. In Eq. (7), particle diﬀusion constant is inversely proportional to particle
diameter dρ , which increases with decreasing particle size. For instance, for water at 20o C
the Brownian diﬀusivity for a 1−μm−diameter particle is 4.3 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 , which is small
compared to solute diﬀusion but potentially signiﬁcant over the small distances within pore
spaces. Qiα is the rate of change of particle volume belonging to a source/sink term. Riα is
the net rate of loss of nanoparticles in size interval i in the phase α. The net rate of loss of
nanoparticles may be written as [18, 17, 21],
Riα =

∂ (δφ)i,α

(8)

∂t

where (δφ)i,α = v1,i,α + v2,i,α is the porosity change due to release or retention of nanoparticles of interval i in the phase α. v1,i,α is the volume of the nanoparticles of interval size i
in contact with the phase α available on the pore surfaces per unit bulk volume of the porous
medium. v2,i,α is the volume of the nanoparticles of interval size i entrapped in pore throats
from the phase α per unit bulk volume of porous medium due to plugging and bridging. Also,
v1,i,α and v2,i,α may be deﬁned in terms of the mass of particles per unit ﬂuid volume deposited
at the pore bodies σ1,i,α and pore throats σ2,i,α of the porous medium as,
v1,i,α =

σ1,iα
,
ρb

v2,i,α =

σ2,i,α
.
ρb

(9)

where ρb is the density of particulate suspensions.
At the critical velocity of the surface deposition only particle retention occurs while above
it retention and entrainment of the nanoparticles take place simultaneously (Gruesbeck and
Collins [14]). A modiﬁed Gruesbeck and Collins’s model for the surface deposition is expressed
by [18],
⎧

|uα | ≤ uαc

(10)
⎩
∂t
γd,i,α |uα | Ci,α − γe,i,α v1,i,α |uα − uαc | , |uα | > uαc
where γd,i,α is the rate coeﬃcients for surface retention of the nanoparticles in interval i in
the phase α. γe,i,α is the rate coeﬃcients for entrainment of the nanoparticles in interval i in
the phase α. uαc is the critical velocity for the phase α. Similarly, the rate of entrapment of
the nanoparticles in interval i in the phase α is,
∂v2,i,α
= γpt,i,α |uα | Ci,α ,
∂t

(11)

where γpt,i,α is the pore throat blocking constants.

Porosity and Permeability Variations

Porosity may be changed because nanoparticles deposition on the pore surfaces or blocking of
pore throats. The porosity variation may be by [18, 21],
φ = φ0 −

(δφ)i,α

(12)

i,α

where φ0 is the initial porosity. Also, the permeability variation due to nanoparticles deposition on the pore surfaces or blocking of pore throats may be expressed as [17],
K = K0 (1 − f ) kf + f

φ
φ0

l

(13)

where K0 is the initial permeability, kf is constant for ﬂuid seepage allowed by the plugged
pores. The ﬂow eﬃciency factor expressing the fraction of unplugged pores available for ﬂow is
given by,
f =1−

γf,i

(14)

v2,i,α
α

i

γf,i is the coeﬃcient of ﬂow eﬃciency for particles i. The value of the exponent l has range
from 2.5 to 3.5. For the nanoparticles transport carried by ﬂuid stream in the porous media,
deposition on pore surfaces and blockage in pore throats may occur. The retained particles on
pore surfaces may desorb for hydrodynamic forces, and then possibly adsorb on other sites of
the pore bodies or get entrapped at other pore throats.

Iterative Implicit Scheme

In this study, we consider only one interval size in the wetting phase. So, for example we
drop the subscript from Ci,w , v1,i,α and v2,i,α to become C, v1 and v2 , respectively. Similarly,
we will drop the subscript i, w, α from all symbols including constants. Deﬁne the time step

length Δtn = tn+1 − tn , the total time interval [0, T ] may be divided into NT time steps as
0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tNT = T . The current time step is represented by the superscript n + 1.
Also, the iteration loop consists of a number NI iterations of each time step. The current
iteration step is denoted by k + 1. The iterative backward Euler time discretization is used for
the equations of pressure, saturation, concentration and the two volumes to obtain,

uw
current time step n + 1. For each iteration, the variables λw ,λn ,λt and fw is calculated using
the saturation from the previous iteration. The pressure equation is solved ﬁrstly to obtain the
wetting-phase pressure at the current iteration and then the Darcys velocity can be calculated.
Therefore, the saturation at the current iteration is computed explicitly in the current iteration.
Then, the concentration and values are computed implicitly at the current time step. Finally,
the permeability, porosity, and other parameters such as λw ,λn ,λt and fw are updated. This
procedure is repeated until the convergence criterion of errors has been satisﬁed. In this iterative
scheme the capillary potential Φc is linearized as follows [20],

where Φc is derivative of Φc . The changes of saturation in a time step are often very small,
and hence the linear approximation is reasonable. On the other hand, we use the relaxation

Numerical Experiments

In this section, we test some examples to show the performance of the presented scheme. Before
presenting the numerical examples, let us introduce the necessary physical parameters used in
the computations.
In this study, we consider the following capillary pressure formula,
pc = −Bc log(S),
and the normalized wetting phase saturation are correlated by,
S=

Sw − Swr
,
1 − Snr − Swr

0 ≤ S ≤ 1,

where Bc is the capillary pressure parameter, Swr is the irreducible (minimal) water (wetting
phase) saturation, and Snr is the residual (minimal) oil (nonwetting phase) saturation after
water ﬂooding.

Also, the expressions of the relation between the relative permeabilities and the normalized
wetting phase saturation S is given as,

where a and b are positive real numbers, krw

to the wetting phase, and krn = krn (S = 0) is the endpoint relative permeability to the nonwetting phase. The capillary pressure function and relative permeabilities are chosen to be
zero for the residual saturations of water and oil; that is, S = Sw . In computation, we take
the minimum of saturation as Sw,min = 10−4 . Moreover, since the relaxation factor has some
eﬀects on the stability and eﬃciency of iterative methods. The choice strategy of relaxation
factor [20], is applied in these calculations. The relaxation factor θs is computed where we take

our tests, we use 2-norm for vectors and matrices.
Moreover, we consider one size interval of nanoparticles suspension in the water phase.
The following parameters values are used in the calculations, γd = 16 m−1 , γpt = 1.28 m−1 ,
γe = 30 m−1 , γd = 16 m−1 , uc = 4.6 × 10−6 m/s, and D = 5.6 × 10−8 m2 /s. The nanoparticles
diameter is taken as 40 nm and concentration C0 = 0.1. Swr = Snr = 0.001, φ0 = 0.3, kf = 0.6,
γf = 0.01. The viscosities of water and oil are 1 cP and 0.45 cP, respectively. The injection
rate is 1.5 PV/year. The relative permeabilities are quadratic, krw0 = kro0 = 1, a = b = 2,
and the capillary pressure parameter is Bc = 50 bar. The domain dimension is taken as 0.3
m × 0.2 m. The computational domain is divided into 2400 uniform rectangles. The choice of
relaxation factor given in Ref. [20] is applied for the iterative method, and the three parameters
are taken as θs,min = 0.1, θs,max = 0.9 and ρ = 0.2. The time step used in this example is
0.0075 day. In the given example, the tested medium consists of two subdomains with diﬀerent
conﬁgurations for the distribution of permeability as shown in the lower left graph of Figure
1. Distributions of water saturation (upper left), water pressure (upper right), nanoparticles
concentration (middle left), deposited nanoparticles concentration (middle right) and porosity
reduction (lower right) are shown in the Figure 1 too.
