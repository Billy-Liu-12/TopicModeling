Abstract
In the present paper, a ﬁnite element model is developed based on a semi-discrete Streamline
Upwind Petrov-Galerkin method to solve the fully-coupled two-dimensional shallow water and
contaminant transport equations on a non-ﬂat bed. The algorithm is applied on ﬁxed computational meshes. Linear triangular elements are used to decompose the computational domain
and a second-order backward diﬀerentiation implicit method is used for the time integration.
The resulting nonlinear system is solved using a Newton-type method where the linear system
is solved at each step using the Generalized Minimal Residual method. In order to examine the
accuracy and robustness of the present scheme, numerical results are veriﬁed by diﬀerent test
cases.
Keywords: shallow water equations, contaminant transport, ﬁnite element method, SUPG method,

Introduction

Since pollutant dispersion in rivers and coastal regions has serious impact on the ecology,
environment and human health, the shallow water models have become an important ﬁeld
of study to predict advection-diﬀusion of contaminant in free surface ﬂows. In some works
[1, 2] the contaminant transport equation is solved using a decoupled algorithm, that is, after
solving the shallow water equations for the ﬂow variables, the contaminant in the ﬂow ﬁeld
is computed. These approaches may lead to inaccurate solutions in some cases, e.g., when
the ﬂow changes fast in time or in space [3]. In order to improve accuracy and robustness, a
fully-coupled model should be implemented that preserves conservation and prevents numerical
instabilities. The resulting system is a hyperbolic system of coupled nonlinear partial diﬀerential
equations. Numerically solving this system is very challenging due to diﬃculties associated with
discontinuities, irregular bed topography, bed roughness and wetting-drying fronts.

A Semi-Discrete SUPG Method for Contaminant Transport

F. Behzadi and J.C. Newman III

The purpose of this work is to simulate unsteady free surface ﬂows and obtain a reliable
estimation of pollution dispersion in such ﬂows. To this end, a semi-discrete Streamline Upwind
Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) ﬁnite element (FE) framework is developed to model the Shallow
Water and Contaminant transport Equations (SWCEs).
The ﬁnite element method has been applied to shallow water equations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15], because of its geometric ﬂexibility and high accuracy. Introducing highorder schemes in ﬁnite element models is straightforward. Additionally, Neumann boundary
conditions are imposed naturally in ﬁnite element algorithms. Both the standard Continuous
Galerkin (CG) and the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods have been employed to solve the
shallow water equations.
Bunya et al. [4] proposed a wetting and drying treatment for the Runge-Kutta Discontinuous
Galerkin approximation to the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs). Lai [10] also developed a DG
ﬁnite element method using a HLLC Riemann solver to calculate the numerical ﬂuxes. Xing [11]
used a high-order DG method for SWEs on unstructured triangular meshes, while maintaining
the still water steady state exactly and preserving the non-negativity of the water height without
loss of mass conservation.
The standard Continuous Galerkin method is stable when diﬀusion dominates, but produces
spurious oscillations in the solution for convection-dominated problems. In order to improve the
stability and convergence of the CG method, Brooks and Hughes [16] introduced the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for incompressible ﬂows. In SUPG the standard
Galerkin weighting functions are modiﬁed by adding a streamline upwind perturbation to the
formulation. The SUPG formulation for compressible ﬂows may be found in [17, 18, 19]. SUPG
is an accurate method in regions where the solution is smooth, but typically introduces localized
oscillations about the discontinuities [20]. To improve this behavior, a discontinuity-capturing
term should be added to the formulation to provide stability near the shock fronts and to
enhance robustness. Many developments have been made using the SUPG scheme for SWEs
in conjunction with the stabilization and shock-capturing parameters. Bova and Carey [21]
presented a symmetric form of the shallow water conservation system which can be discretized
using SUPG method previously proposed for a symmetric form of the Euler equation [22].
Heniche et al. [9] developed a CG ﬁnite element model which accepts positive and negative
values for the water depth. Takase et al. [5] presented a space-time SUPG formulation for
the SWEs using the stabilization and shock-capturing parameters based on the model applied
to the Navier-Stokes equations in [23, 24, 25]. Takase et al. [6] also developed a space-time
SUPG method which combines a stabilization parameter, a compressible-ﬂow shock-capturing
parameter adapted for shallow-water ﬂows, and remeshing. Zhao et al. [7] used a well-balanced
two-step Taylor-Galerkin scheme with a local bed slope modiﬁcation in wetting-drying interfaces. Porta et al. [8] provided a space-time adaptation scheme which permits separate space
and time adaptation.
A ﬁnite element model may be implemented using either a moving or a ﬁxed computational
grid to deal with wetting-drying problems. Bates and Horritt[26] presented diﬀerent moving and
ﬁxed grid models. Deforming mesh schemes for moving boundary problems involves tracking
the exact location of the shoreline, relocating grid points and testing for mesh quality at each
time step; which results in an ineﬃcient procedure. Bates and Hervouet [27] presented a ﬁnite
element algorithm to solve moving-boundary problems on ﬁxed numerical grids and consists of
identifying partly wet elements, canceling spurious water-surface slope terms in the momentum
equations and rescaling the continuity equation to represent the true volume of water on the
partly wet elements. In [12, 28], a DG scheme is applied on SWCEs to simulate the contaminant
transport in shallow water ﬂows.

A Semi-Discrete SUPG Method for Contaminant Transport

F. Behzadi and J.C. Newman III

In the present study, a new well-balanced ﬁnite element model is developed based on semidiscrete SUPG method to solve the two-dimensional fully-coupled SWCEs. In the present work,
a form of SWEs used in a ﬁnite volume algorithm [29], is now introduced into the ﬁnite element
framework. Having discussed the disadvantage of deforming mesh schemes, simulations are
carried out based on an Eulerian method on a ﬁxed computational grid. Linear triangles are
used to decompose the computational domain. The current method can be easily extended to
higher order elements. An implicit method using the second-order backward diﬀerence (BDF2)
scheme is applied for the time integration.

Two-Dimensional Shallow Water and Contaminant
Transport Equations

The two-dimensional shallow water equations are obtained from depth averaging the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations assuming that the pressure is hydrostatic and vertical acceleration is negligible. In this work, viscosity, turbulence, wind eﬀects, and Coriolis terms are
omitted. To satisfy the still-water equilibrium in the presence of a non-ﬂat bed, Rogers et al.
[30, 31] presented a particular formulation based on the free surface elevation ζ(x, y, t). As
shown in ﬁgure (1), ζ(x, y, t) = h(x, y, t) − hs (x, y).
Sivakumar et al.[29] used a similar version of Rogers formulation in [30, 31]. This special
form of the equations satisﬁes the still-water equilibrium and allows for possible dry regions. In
this study, the formulation in [29] is used and coupled with the depth averaged scalar transport
equation. The resulting system of non-dimensional SWCEs for two-dimensional problems may
be written in conservative form as

Numerical Results

In order to validate and verify the present numerical method, two test cases are considered.
The ﬁrst case involves contaminant transport in a square cavity and the second case simulates
a pollutant distribution in a dam break scenario.

5.1

Pollutant Advection in a Square Cavity

The present test problem, taken from [3], is described as pure advection of contaminant in a
square cavity. In the current work, the topology is assumed to be smooth and ﬂat and there
are no frictional forces. The computational domain is a 9km × 9km square channel, which is
discretized with a nonuniform unstructured grid. A uniform ﬂow with u = v = 0.5 m/s and
h = 0.2485 m is imposed on the entire domain. The initial pollutant concentration is given by
the following superposition of Gaussian distributions

d1 =

(x − x1 ) + (y − y1 )

d2 =

(x − x2 ) + (y − y2 )

(22)

(23)

The above constants are chosen as follows
x1 = y1 = 1400 m

x2 = y2 = 2400 m

φ1 = 10

φ2 = 6.5

δ1 = δ2 = 264

Characteristic inﬂow and outﬂow conditions are applied on the boundaries. The exact
solution is that the pollutant concentration moves diagonally across the domain with constant
speed, while its shape should be preserved for all time. Figure (2) illustrates the computed
results of this test case compared to the theoretical solution at diﬀerent times. As seen, the
computed results do not display signiﬁcant dispersion or dissipation errors and, therefore, agree
very well with the theoretical values.

5.2

Pollutant Transport following a Dam Break

To demonstrate the ability of the present methodology to predict contaminant transport in
the presence of discontinuities, a test case similar to [3, 34] is considered. The geometry for
pollutant transport following a dam break is shown in ﬁgure (3a). The bed is assumed to be
ﬂat and smooth. The ﬂow depth is initially set to 0.5 m and 0.1 m at the lower and upper part
of the domain, respectively. The two halves are separated by a gate which is removed at t = 0.
The initial pollutant concentration is shown in ﬁgure (3b) and given by
φ(x, y, 0) =

0.0 r ≥ 0.65
1.0 r < 0.65

, r=

(x − 1.97)2 + (y − 1.35)2

(24)

The contaminant distribution computed with the present numerical method is simply displayed
in ﬁgure (4) at diﬀerent times. Figure (5) displays changes in water depth and contaminant
concentration with time at a selected point P(1.35,1.96).

Conclusion

A semi-discrete SUPG method is developed in the present study to simulate the contaminant
transport in shallow water ﬂows. In order to accommodate discontinuities of ﬂow variables and
pollutant concentration, a shock-capturing scheme is applied with the SUPG method. Linear
triangular elements and second-order backward diﬀerentiation is used in the present study. The
nonlinear system of coupled equations is solved using a Newton-type scheme and the GMRES
algorithm. The ﬁnite element method is applied to two cases to demonstrate the ability of model
to predict contaminant distribution in presence of a cavity and discontinuities. The results
indicate that the present SUPG methodology is capable of accurately simulating pollutant
transport. Future work is intended to validate the current methodology with experimental
measurements.
