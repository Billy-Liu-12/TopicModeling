Abstract
Service restoration in energy distribution systems is a complex optimization problem with
many restrictions. After a fault occurrence, the challenge is obtain a service restoration plan
reconnecting all the healthy out-of-service areas satisfying all the operational and technical
constraints. Recent works have study the use of meta-heuristics in order to ﬁnd a sub-optimal
solution with low computational complexity. One of these works include the use of a multiobjective algorithm with a new data structure called node depth encoding. This paper proposes
and analyses the use of a new heuristic initialization procedure to be used with node depth
encoding which guarantees the analysis of all possible solutions considering only a restricted
number of switches incident to the out-of-service areas. The proposed methodology is evaluated
by applying it to the real and large-scale distribution system of Londrina city (Brazil). The
results showed that the new heuristic improves the overall performance reducing the number of
switches operations to reconﬁgure the distribution system.

Introduction

Fault service restoration is a important task in energy distribution system. After the identiﬁcation of a faulted zone, a proper plan to network reconﬁguration is applied to change the
topological structure of distribution system by opening sectionalizing (Normally Closed - NC)
switches and closing tie (Normally Open - NO) switches. When the reconﬁguration plan is
executed, the main objectives are to minimize both the number of out-of-service areas and the

number of switching operations without violating the radial structure of the network and operational constraints (limits for node voltage, network loading, and substation loading). In general,
most of the works for this problem is based on heuristic and meta-heuristics [1, 2] algorithms.
However, the most of these methodologies demand long running time when applied to large-scale
distribution system with thousands of buses and switches. The methodology proposed in [2]
overcomes this hurdle combining Multiple-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) with
the tree encoding named Node-Depth Encoding (NDE) [3]. The proposed solution generated
adequate service restoration plans a real and large-scale distribution system without requiring
any network simpliﬁcation. However, in a group of fault cases the results can be improved.
In this paper we propose a algorithm called (MEA-H: Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Heuristic) to improve the results obtained by [1] and [2]. This heuristic incorporating
in the ﬁrst stage of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm an combinatorial search procedure
over the data structure node depth encoding evolving only switches incident to the out-of-service
areas, called as Tier 1 tie switches [4]. It guarantees the analysis of all possible conﬁgurations,
that restore the service to the healthy out-of-service customers, considering only the Tier 1 tie
switches.

Distribution System Representation Using Node-Depth
Encoding

For problems involving network reconﬁguration in distribution systems, as the service restoration problem, the distribution electrical network is considered as a collection of components
interconnected electrically by conductors and switches. Consequently, for service restoration
problem the distribution system is usually represented by a graph, that is, by a set of nodes (or
vertices) connected by edges. The electrical network can be viewed as a set of sectors (which can
are composed by electric conductors, load and passage buses, etc.) interconnected by switches.
Figure 1(a) highlights the main components of an illustrative and typical DS with two
Feeders. Figure 1(b) presents the graph representation of this DS, where the nodes symbolize
the sectors, edges in solid lines symbolize NC switches and edges in dashed lines symbolize NO
switches. Observe that the two feeders of this DS (Figure 1(a)) are represented by two graph
trees formed by the solid lines in Figure 1(b). The nodes S1 and S2 in the graph are the root
nodes of trees 1 and 2. These nodes correspond to the buses S1 and S2, which are, respectively,
in substations 1 and 2.

and their depths1 . It can be computationally represented by an array of pairs (nx, dx), where nx
is the node label and dx is its depth in the tree. The order in which the pairs are disposed on the
linear list is fundamental and can be obtained from a depth search algorithm by inserting a pair
(nx, dx) in the list each time a node nx is visited by the algorithm. This processing is performed
oﬄine. Figure 2 shows the NDE lists for the trees in Fig. 1(b). As illustrated in Figure 2, a
whole forest is encoded by the set of the NDE lists of all trees in the forest. Therefore, the
forest data structure can be easily implemented using an array of pointers, where each pointer
indexes an NDE of a tree.

Figure 2: NDE arrays for the two graph trees of Figure 1(b).
Two operators, namely Preserve Ancestor Operator (PAO) and Change Ancestor Operator
(CAO), were developed to eﬃciently manipulate a forest stored in NDEs producing a new
one [5]. Each operator modiﬁes the forest encoded by the NDE arrays, which is equivalent
to pruning and grafting a subtree of a forest generating a new forest. Additional information
about the NDE and its operators applied to DS reconﬁguration problems is provided in [5].
The mathematical formulation of SR problem can be founded in [2, 6], where the optimization
process consists in determining the minimal number of switching operations that results in a
conﬁguration with minimal number of out-of-service loads without violating the operational
and radiality constraints.

Proposed Methodology

To restore the out-of-service areas tie switches (NO switches) and sectionalizing switches (NC
switches) are operated. Switching operations often occurs in pairs to maintain a radial network
structure. Considering the incidence of the tie switches to the network topology, it is possible
to envision a series of diﬀerent tiers [4]. Tier 1 are switch pairs and feeders incident to the
out-of-service area; Tier 2 are switch pairs and feeders incident to Tier 1; Tier N are switch
pairs and feeders incident to Tier (N − 1).
To restore power some set of Tier 1 must be used. But, it is possible that Tier 1 does
not have enough capacity to restore all out-of-service areas. In this case higher tiers must
be considered. The MEA [2] allows multi-tier or system-wide switching in order to solve the
service restoration problem. However, it does not guarantee ﬁnding the feasible solution with
the minimal number of switching operations, that is, the service restoration plan reconnecting
all the healthy out-of-service areas satisfying all the operational and technical constraints using
only Tier 1 tie switches, when it is possible. This because the MEA does not analysis all the
possible solutions considering only Tier 1 tie switches.
The proposed methodology, named MEA-H, comprises two stages: Stage 1 - Generation
and analysis of all possible solutions considering only the Tier 1 tie switches; and Stage 2 Application of MEA using all the possible initial conﬁgurations generated in Stage 1 (in stage
2 higher tiers are considered).
Once the heuristic generated all those feasible conﬁgurations using NDE operators, the
feasibility of these candidate solutions must be veriﬁed in order to evaluate whether there is

one (in case there are two or more feasible solutions) according to the operational constraints.
Then, the eﬃcient SLFA for DSs based on NDE is run for each one of these conﬁgurations
in order to make sure that if none of the problem restrictions has been violated. After MEA
runs from those feasible conﬁgurations obtained by the heuristic in order to ﬁnd a feasible
solution considering switching operations in higher tiers. The MEA is the same implementation
proposed by [1, 2] with 13 objectives.

Results and Discussion

This section presents the results of the application of both MEA and MEA-H to solve the SR
problem considering the real and large-scale DS of Londrina city (Brazil), which has 21,642
buses, 3,196 NC switches, 357 NO switches, 7 substations (SBs), 68 feeders, 3,133 sectors and
more than 231,000 customers (or loads). For all simulations both methodologies will search by
the best solution, that is, the found feasible solution with lowest number of switching operations.
The proposed methodology was compared with the proposed solution by Sanches et. al. [2].
The MEA-H evolutionary process starts considering all possible solutions involving operations
only in Tier 1 tie switches. In order to evaluate the performance of those methodologies, were
performed 100 trials (100,000 evaluations at each trial) to ﬁnd service restoration plans for each
fault case for each methodology. Table 1 shows the switches operations number, obtained by
both solutions, performed considering single fault in sectors 816, 901, 1054, 1055, 1057, 1058,
1060 and 2163. All cases are real fault situations. Note that *FSNF refers to trials with no
feasible solution found.

Analyzing the results shown in Table 1 (for the switching operations minimization point of
view), we conclude that the heuristic improves the solutions in seven cases considered (except
2163 where both methodologies found the same results). For example, considering fault in sector
816, in only 56 trials MEA found feasible solutions requiring up to ﬁve switching operations. On
other hand, 99 trials of MEA-H found service restoration plan with this number of operations.
Such results indicate that heuristic signiﬁcantly improved the exploration of the space search.
In the 1060 fault sector case, the number of results with only not feasible solutions founded by
MEA-H and MEA was the same. Nevertheless in only 12 trials MEA found feasible solutions
requiring up to ﬁve switching operations while MEA-H found service restoration plan with this
number of operations in 23 trials.

Conclusions

This paper proposed a solution to service restoration problem in a real large-scale distribution
system. The solution include a simple yet eﬀective improvement by incorporating a heuristic
as a ﬁrst stage of the Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm with the tree encoding named
Node-Depth Encoding. This propose guarantees the analysis of all possible initial conﬁgurations
considering a restrict number of switches and improves the exploration of the space search in
evolutionary algorithm. Several simulation results have shown that the proposed solution is a
promising methodology for service restoration problem.
