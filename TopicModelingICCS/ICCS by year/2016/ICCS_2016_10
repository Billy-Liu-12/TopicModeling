Abstract
In this work, we propose a new deﬁnition of support and conﬁdence measures based on interval
representation. Moreover, a new algorithm, named EBS-Apriori, based on these bounded measures and several pruning strategies is developed. A new associative classiﬁer, named WEvAC,
based on fusion and weighting technique is implemented and tested. Experiments are conducted
using several database benchmarks. Performance analysis showed a better prediction outcome
for our proposed approach in comparison with several literature-based methods.

Introduction

Modern data acquisition is commonly characterized by the presence of uncertainty and imprecision leading to a new research challenge. When data mining techniques are applied to these
data, their uncertainty has to be considered to obtain high quality results as well as to interpret
prediction outcomes with more conﬁdence. Therefore, several frameworks are used to represent
the uncertainty and imprecision such as probabilities [1], fuzzy set theory [3] and more recently
evidence theory [6]. The latter has led to the emergence of a new kind of database, named evidential database, that generalizes probabilistic and binary databases [12]. Thus, several basic
concepts related to data mining domain has to be revised and this remains a challenging issue
for the community. In particular, when dealing with evidential databases, several researches
tackled the computing of the support and the conﬁdence measures [1, 6, 9, 13]. The support
represents the frequency of appearance of a pattern within a database. For fuzzy and even for
evidential databases, several measures exist depending on the used strategy. For example in
fuzzy data mining, several measures were introduced depending on the studied context and application such as [3, 7]. Thus, a main concern arises: which support measure should be chosen?.
The same question could be asked for the conﬁdence measure that computes how pertinent a
rule is. Several measures have been proposed to compute the support and the conﬁdence in
evidential data mining. In [6], the authors proposed a belief-based measure of support. It relies

relying on a probabilistic formulation [13]. Moreover, in [11], Samet et al. introduced a new
measure of conﬁdence for association rules based on support measure. In fact, the uniﬁcation
of the support and the conﬁdence measures is so wide and there is a lack of consensus about
the choice of the appropriate support and conﬁdence measures. In this work, we aimed at
providing a unifying deﬁnition of support and conﬁdence measures within evidential database.
We proposed a new representation of support and conﬁdence measures using interval arithmetic. This representation is bounded by the lower and the upper values that the support
(resp. conﬁdence) could take. From a methodological point of view, this paper includes the
following key contributions: (i) deﬁnition of new measures of support and conﬁdence expressed
with intervals within evidential databases; (ii) development of new mining algorithm, named
EBS-Apriori, that retrieves frequent patterns and valid association rules; (iii) implementation
of an associative classiﬁer algorithm based on weighted valid association rules and evidence
theory fusion techniques.
This paper is organized as follows: in section 2, the state-of-the-art works of evidential data
mining are recalled brieﬂy. In section 3, we introduce new bounded support and conﬁdence
measures. The EBS-Apriori mining algorithm is detailed in 4. In addition, several strategies
for patterns and association rules pruning are presented. The performance of our proposed
approach was studied on several database benchmarks in section 5. Finally, we conclude and
sketch potential issues for the future work.

Preliminaries: Evidential data mining

In this section, we present brieﬂy the main concepts of data mining over evidential databases.
Deﬁnition 1. Evidential databases [8] aim at handling imprecise and uncertain data. Formally,
an evidential database is a triplet EDB = (AEDB , O, REDB ). AEDB and O are respectively the
set attributes and d transactions (i.e., rows). Each column Ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) has a domain Θi of
discrete values. REDB expresses the relationship between the j th transaction (i.e., row Tj ) and
the ith column (i.e., attribute Ai ) by a normalized BBA mij : 2Θi → [0, 1] as follows:
⎧
⎨mij (∅) = 0
(1)
mij (ω) = 1.
⎩
ω⊆Θi

Table 1 illustrates an example of an evidential database. An item corresponds to a focal
element1 . An evidential association rule R is a causal relationship between two itemsets that
1 Each

subset A of 2Θ , fulﬁlling m(A) > 0, is called a focal element.

1823

can be written in the following form R : X → Y such that X ∩Y = ∅. Two diﬀerent itemsets can
be related via either the inclusion or the intersection operator. Indeed, the inclusion operator
for evidential itemsets [6] is deﬁned as follows, where X and Y are two evidential itemsets:
X ⊆ Y ⇐⇒ ∀xi ∈ X, xi ⊆ yj .
xi and yj are respectively the ith and the j th element of X and Y . For the same evidential
itemsets X and Y , the intersection operator is deﬁned as follows: X ∩ Y = Z ⇐⇒ ∀zk ∈
Z, zk ⊆ xi and zk ⊆ yj .
Example 1. In Table 1, A1 is an item and ΘA × B1 is an itemset such that A1 ⊂ ΘA × B1
and A1 ∩ ΘA × B1 = A1 . A1 → B1 is an evidential association rule.
As it is the case for probabilistic data mining [14], the support within the evidential context
is based on expectation. Two support family approaches were proposed. The ﬁrst support
measure was proposed by [6] and called the belief-based support measure. It is considered as
the lower bound for the support. It is written as follows:
SupBel
Tj (X) =

SupBel
Tj (xi ) =
i∈[1...n]

Bel(xi )

i∈[1...n]

such as the belief function Bel(.) is computed as Bel(A) =

m(B). Thus, the belief-

Since the belief-based support is a lower estimation of the support, it is obvious in some
cases that an itemset I could have a higher support value. Another measure was introduced
by Samet et al.[13] that provides a medium estimation. The evidential support of an itemset
X=
xi in the transaction Tj (i.e., P rTj ) is then computed as follows:
i∈[1...n]

Thus, the evidential support SupP

A new metric for conﬁdence computing based on the precise-based support measure is introduced in [13]. For an association rule R : Ra → Rc , the conﬁdence is computed as follows:

Conf (R) =

SupTj (Ra ) × SupTj (Rc )

The precise-based support provides several limits. In fact, computing the support by integrating the disjunction of hypotheses (e.g Θi ) could lead to incoherent behaviour. Example 2
details the limits of both support measures.
Example 2. Let us assume the evidential database depicted in Table 1. We aim at computing
the support of A1 . The belief-based support gives a support equal to 0.7
2 . This support value is

the lowest value that A1 could have. On the other hand, the precise support gives 0.85+0.35
as
2
A1 support since it belongs by half to ΘA . Even so, no one can be sure if the support would be
equal to those values.
In the following section, we aim at avoiding the limits of state-of-the-art support measure
shown in Example 2. We intend to model the support within an interval rather with a single
value. Interval support modelling ensures an accurate support. Indeed, with such modelling
we are sure that the real value of the support belongs to the retained interval.

3

Bounded support and conﬁdence in evidential databases

In this section, we introduce a bounded value of the support within evidential databases. Thus,
we are sure that the real value of the support belongs to the interval. Such methodology can
be further extended to probabilistic and fuzzy cases.
The aim is to compute an upper and a lower bound for the Sup(x) that we denote respectively as Sup(x) and Sup(x). In evidence theory, the belief function Bel(.) in a subset A ⊆ Θ
is interpreted as the belief one actually commits to A. On the other hand, another measure
called plausibility P l(.) is interpreted as the maximum possible belief one may commit to A
and is written as follows:
m(B) = 1 − Bel(¬A).

P l(A) =

(7)

B∩A=∅

We can easily verify that P l(A) ≥ Bel(A). Then, the interval [Bel(A),Pl(A)] represents the
quantitative judgements on a proposition A based on a given evidence. Both functions are
sometimes referred to, respectively, as the lower and upper probability measures [5]. In addition,
the precise support which is an extension of the pignistic probability to the powerset (a.k.a 2Θ )
belong to the aforementioned interval.
Deﬁnition 2. Let us assume an itemset X = x1 × . . . × xk in the evidential database EDB, the
transactional bounded support of X within a transaction j is computed as follows:

Example 3. Let us assume the evidential database depicted in Table 1. Figure 1 and 2 illustrate
the transactional bounded and the bounded support of the itemset A1 × B1 .
Property 1. The bounded support is interval-wise anti-monotonic. For two itemset A and
A × X in EDB, we have:
SupEDB (A) ≤ SupEDB (A × X)

(10)

SupEDB (A) ≤ SupEDB (A × X).

(11)

Proof. Property 1 is proved by reasoning under the constraint P l(X) ∈ [0, 1] for an itemset
A × X. The same goes for the lower bound of the support with the belief function such as
SupEDB (A × X) ≤ SupEDB (A) [6].
Let us assume an association rule R : Ra → Rc , such that Rc and Ra are respectively the
conclusion and the premise part of the rule R. As originally introduced in binary databases, the
conﬁdence measure was relying on conditional probability [2]. The conﬁdence could be relying
on a probability, fuzzy or an evidential conditional measure depending on the used uncertain
framework. The same issues assigned to the state-of-the-art support measures are still valid for
conﬁdence measures. Therefore, in the following, we introduce a bounded computation for the
conﬁdence. Then, the bounded conﬁdence can be written as follows:
d

˜ (R) = [Conf (R), Conf (R)] = [ j=1

Example 4. Let us assume the evidential database of Table 1. The bounded support of the item, 1×0.8+0.7×1

set A1 × B1 is computed as follows: Sup˜EDB (A1 × B1 ) = [ 0.7×0.4+0

Then, the conﬁdence of the association rule R : A1 → B1 becomes:
˜ (R) = [ 0.7 × 0.4 + 0 , 1 × 0.8 + 0.7 × 1 ] = [0.4, 0.88].

Data mining with bounded support and conﬁdence

In this section, we investigate the mining process of frequent patterns and valid association
rules under the new bounded support and conﬁdence.

4.1

Frequent patterns and valid association rules extraction

We assume that minsup and minconf (denoted respectively α and β) are two thresholds ﬁxed
by the user. Patterns are called frequent if their support are greater than or equal to α. The
same goes for association rules which must have a conﬁdence greater than or equal to β to
be considered as valid. Now, assuming an itemset I with a support [a, b] and α, under which
conditions this pattern is considered as frequent?
Deﬁnition 4. Let I be a pattern extracted from the evidential database EDB with a support
[SupEDB (I), SupEDB (I)] and α is the support threshold. I is a frequent pattern if SupEDB (I) ≥
α. I is a non frequent pattern if SupEDB (I) < α.

(b) Optimistic set of frequent patterns.

SupEDB (X)

The decision becomes more complex when I has an α ∈ [SupEDB (I), SupEDB (I)]. Therefore,
in this work, we distinguish three strategies to consider those speciﬁc itemsets. The optimistic
approach consists in considering an itemset frequent as long as α is lower than the upper bound
of the support interval (i.e., SupEDB (I) ≥ α). The pessimistic approach prunes every itemset
having an α strictly lower than the lower bound of the support (i.e., SupEDB (I) ≥ α). The same
methodology could be applied for association rules with β as threshold. In fact, an association
rule R is valid as long as β is lower than or equal to the lower bound of R’s conﬁdence interval.
On the other hand, R is said a non valid rule if β is higher than the upper bound of its conﬁdence
interval. Two main strategies for pruning association rules can be distinguished: the optimistic
and the pessimistic strategies. The optimistic strategy retains rules having β lower than or
equal to the upper bound of the conﬁdence. On the counter part, the pessimistic strategy
consists in retaining any association rule that has a lower bound of the conﬁdence greater than
or equal to β. Figure 3 shows the range of α (resp. β for the conﬁdence) for both optimistic
and pessimistic strategies.
To mine frequent patterns and valid association rules from evidential databases with the
bounded support, a speciﬁc EBS-Apriori algorithm is developed. The proposed algorithm
is an Apriori-based one [2]. The development of an Apriori-based algorithm is justiﬁed by its
perfomance over tree-based ones in dense databases [14]. The evidential databases are naturally
dense. The algorithm 1 details EBS-Apriori. It is a level-wise algorithm similar to UApriori [4]
and the original binary Apriori [2]. The generated candidates are pruned with respect to their
computed support. The main diﬀerence is that the support is computed as an interval. As the
UApriori, EBS-Apriori includes a trimming part [4]. The basic idea behind it is to trim away
items with low existential presence from the evidential database and then to mine the trimmed
structure. As a result, a structure called T rim T able is constructed that stores the belief values
(i.e., Bel(.)) of interesting items. The plausibility value is not needed since it can be computed
from the belief values (see Equation 7). Depending on the computed support, the itemset is
either aﬀected to the set of optimistic frequent patterns (i.e., OEIFF) or pessimistic one (i.e.,
PEIFF). The bounded support is computed with the use of Bounded Sup(.) function that
provides two outputs: the lower and the upper bound of the support of a candidate itemset.
The support is computed from the T rim T able structure. The function Rule generation(.)
takes as input the set of optimistic frequent itemset (i.e., OEIFF since PEIFF ⊆ OEIFF)
and generates the set of optimistic and pessimistic valid association rules (i.e., Ropt and Rpes ).

4.2

Weighted Evidential Associative Classiﬁer

Let us suppose the existence of an instance X to classify represented a set of BBAs belonging
to the evidential database EDB as X = {mi |i ∈ [1, n]}. Each retained association rule, from
the rule set R, is considered as a potential piece of knowledge that could be helpful for the
class retrieval of X. R could be either the set of optimistic or pessimistic association rules (i.e.,
Ropt and Rpes ). In order to select rules that may lead to the correct classiﬁcation, we look for
association rules having a non null intersection with X and contain a class in the conclusion
part, i.e., RI = {R ∈ R|∃x ∈ Θi , mi (x) > 0, x ∈ Ra ∧ ∃y ∈ ΘC , y ∈ RC }, where ΘC is

the frame of discernment of the class. Each rule found in the set RI constitutes a piece of
information concerning the membership of the instance X. Since several rules can be found
and fulﬁlling the intersection condition, it is important to beneﬁt from them all. In our work,
we assume that all information are valuable and should be handled as an information fusion
problem. From the set of association rules obtained through the use of optimistic or pessimistic
strategy, each rule Rl ⊂ RI, l ∈ [1 . . . L] and L < |RI|, is transformed into a BBA with respect
to the frame of discernment ΘC (i.e., frame of discernment of the class in Rc ) as follows:

where γ ∈ [0, 1[ prevents from having a certain BBA2 and Rc is the conclusion part of the
rule Rl . W (.) is a weight function taking values in [0,1]. It expresses how much a rule Rl will
be considered before rules combination. It is ﬁxed to 1 for either optimistic and pessimistic
derived set of rules. In this work, we used the lower bound of the conﬁdence to respect the
minimum information principle. The L constructed BBA are then fused following Dempster’s

perfect knowledge and the absolute certainty.

(14)

When the weight function is ﬁxed to 1, Equation 14 combines all association rules with the same
consideration. One problem may arise when applying one of those two pruning strategies. The
optimistic strategy could be too optimistic by retaining rules with an upper bound conﬁdence
close to β. The same goes for the pessimistic strategy that prunes even association rules
with β close to the lower bound of the conﬁdence. Those limits could be problematic for an
associative classiﬁer that uses rules for prediction and classiﬁcation. Therefore, in the following,
we introduce a distance-based method to weight association rules having β in the conﬁdence
interval. A method would be to compute the distance between β and the upper bound of the
conﬁdence. The weight function W (.) can be computed as follows:
W (R) = 1 −

Conf (R) − β
Conf (R) − Conf (R)

if β ∈ [Conf (R), Conf (R)].

(15)

The weight function W (.) would be of help for developing an alternative to the optimistic and
pessimistic strategies in considering rules with β in the conﬁdence interval.
Algorithm 2 details the classiﬁcation process based on the largest premise rules. The function
F ILT RAT E LARGE P REM ISE(.) (line 1) allows to select valid association rules and to
retain only those with the largest premise, having an intersection with the instance to classify
or to predict X. In fact, the set of the largest premise rules are more precise than those with
a shorter one [13]. Function W eight(.) computes the weight of an association rule as detailed
in Equation (15). Once found, they are considered as independent sources and are combined
(line 5). The function argmax in line 6 allows the retention of the hypothesis that maximizes
the pignistic probability [13].

Experiments

The algorithms were applied on several real benchmarks transformed into evidential databases
[13]. We used two types of benchmarks. The largest databases such as Skin Segmentation
(245057 rows, 4 columns and 32 focal elements), KEGG Metabolic Relation Network (53414
rows, 23 columns and 96 focal elements) and MAGIC Gamma Telescope (19020 rows, 11 columns
and 44 focal elements) were used to assess the scalability of the mining algorithm. The smallest
databases such as Wine (178 rows, 13 columns and 416 focal elements), Vertebral column (310
rows, 6 columns and 192 focal elements), Diabetes (768 rows, 8 columns and 256 focal elements)
and Iris (150 rows, 5 columns and 40 focal elements) were tested to assess the accuracy of the
classiﬁer. Even if the number of records and columns seems limited, they expand exponentially
in imperfect databases. For example, a database of n columns contains n × 2clus focal elements
(i.e., items) after evidential transforming process using Evidential C-Means (ECM) [13]. clus
is the number of clusters given as a parameter to ECM.
Figure 4 (a), (b) and (c) show the runtime performances of several algorithms on the largest
datasets. In fact, we compared EBS-Apriori in its optimistic and pessimistic versions (EBSApriori-Opt and EBS-Apriori-Pes) to BIT [6] which is the tree-based algorithm that uses the
belief-based support. We also made a comparison to EDMA [13] which is also an Apriori-based
algorithm that compute the support with the precise measure. It is important to notice that
EBS-Apriori-Pes produces the same output as BIT but more time consuming since it computes
the support as an interval. EBS-Apriori-Opt is the most time consuming since it generates

much more frequent patterns than the other algorithms. For example, in Magic EDB database
EDMA retrieves a peak of 13749 frequent patterns in contrast with EBS-Apriori-Opt that
generates 27891 ones. The results also consolidates that EDMA is more expensive runtime-wise
than BIT [13]. Figure 4 (d), (f) and (g) compare the number of extracted frequent patterns
with optimistic and pessimistic versions of the support to the precise-based support. The beliefbased support was not considered in this comparative study since its results match those of
the pessimistic one. The results show a high number of frequent patterns for EBS-Apriori-Opt
for all considered databases. The frequent patterns retrieved by the EDMA outnumber those
of the EBS-Apriori-Pes (aka belief-based support). As it is the case for binary data mining,
a frequent itemset Ik of size k generates 2k − 2 association rules. Thus, the number of valid
association rules for EBS-Apriori-Opt outnumber all of other approaches. The accuracies of
the evidential associative classiﬁers are depicted in Table 2. We compared WEvAC in its
optimistic, pessimistic (i.e., optimistic and pessimistic strategies of association rule’s pruning
with a ﬁxed weight parameter W = 1) versions (WEvAC-Opt, WEvAC-Pes) to the weighted
versions (WEvAC). Moreover, we confronted the performance of our presented approaches to
the state-of-the-art ones: EDMA classiﬁer [13] and CMAR associative classiﬁer [10]. The results
showed that a great number of rules could hamper the accuracy of the classiﬁer as it is the
case for WEvAC-Opt. This behaviour can be explained by the outcome of the combination
operator within the algorithm. In fact, the more you combine rules, the low accuracy you
get. The best results are those of WEvAC. This can be explained by the weight function
that adjust the number of used rules and reduces the impact of some rules in the combination
stage. EDMA in its associative classiﬁer version provides interesting results similar to those
of WEvAC. In addition, our results showed also that WEvAC in its pessimistic and weighted
versions outperform the associative classiﬁer CMAR. In fact, the imprecision handling with
evidence theory allows us to handle new type of rules with a composed items in the premise part.
For example, in wine database, we may have rule: if you have an Ash between 1.75 and 2.10
then the wine belongs to class 1. Such kind of rules could improve the accuracy results. Finally,
we compared WEvAC to the Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks implemented in

accuracy. Those results conﬁrm the impact of imprecision handling within databases.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced new measures of support and conﬁdence computed as intervals
within the evidential database framework. A new mining algorithm and an associative classiﬁer
were also developed and analyzed. As illustrated in the experiment section, the proposed

approach provided an interesting performance on several database benchmarks. In future work,
we will be interested in generalizing the proposed approach in probabilistic and fuzzy databases.
Furthermore, the performance of EBS-Apriori algorithm could be improved by adding speciﬁc
heuristics such as the decremental pruning [1].
