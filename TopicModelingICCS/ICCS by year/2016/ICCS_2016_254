Abstract
Identifying users across social networks has got more and more attention. The existing methods
mainly estimate the pairwise similarity between users in diﬀerent social networks and mainly
rely on users’ proﬁles and activities. But the users who pay attention to their privacy may
change their proﬁles and relationships. In this paper, we propose a MUSIC (Modeling User
Style for Identifying aCcounts across Social Networks) framework to address this problem: First,
we build users content style model based on users message using word embedding technology;
Second, we reduce the problem of ﬁnding users across social networks to classiﬁcation problem
on a single social network. Our experimental results validate the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of
our framework, and shows either all of user’s message or only user’s original posts can provide
nearly the same eﬃciency in identifying this kind of users.

Introduction

Many people participate in more than one social network. Then the problem is: can we identify
user accounts across social networks which actually belong to one single person? Despite there
are many studies on various related topics including user linkage across social media, authorship
identiﬁcation across documents, etc. There are still some problem remains unsolved. Most
existing works mainly focus on estimating similarity between user accounts from diﬀerent social
networks and mainly rely on user’s proﬁles, relationships, and activities. But users who pay
attention to their privacy can change their proﬁles and relationships easily.
This paper mainly focuses on users who pay attention to their privacy across social networks
and take some actions to hide their identities. To address these challenges, we propose a
MUSIC framework to address this problem by only considering users message. Our technical
breakthrough comes from an import feature unique to social data: studies [5] demonstrate
that over a suﬃciently long period of time, a user’s social behaviour shows a high level of
consistency across diﬀerent social networks. So this paper mainly analysis the content features

of users message and want to get the consistency across social networks. We show that we can
identify user accounts across social networks even if only exploring the message user has posted.
We design a content style model to measure the similarity of users across social networks.
Based on this model, we develop a framework in two-steps to achieve a good accuracy: 1)
build users content style model based on users message, and identify user accounts across social
networks by checking the similarity of users content style vector; 2) reduce the problem of
ﬁnding user accounts across social networks to classiﬁcation problem on a single social network.
We evaluate this method on three popular social networks: Twitter, Google+, and Facebook.
Our experimental results show that this method can eﬀectively identify user accounts across
social networks only based on users’ message. It can achieve at least 74.0 F1-score using
classiﬁcation methods and can get 89.3 F1-score when only checking whether a user has multiple
user accounts across social networks.

The Deﬁnition of Problem

Let G = (V, R) denote a social network, where V = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } is a set of |V | = N users.
Each user vi is associated with a d-dimensional content style vector ri ( the ith row in R)
which is deﬁned based on message user has posted. The input consists of a set of m social
networks Q = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gm }, where Gk = (Vk , Rk ) represents the kth social network, and
Rk denotes an |Vk | ∗ d matrix with an element rik indicating the content style vector of ith user
in Gk . Table 1 summarizes the notations used in this paper. Given a user account ui of GK ,
our user identiﬁcation procedure attempts to learn an identiﬁcation function f (ui , Q) such at

Related Work

The ﬁrst work on user linking was conducted by Zafarani in 2009[6] who provide a method to ﬁnd
the mappings among identities across multiple communities. Perito [4] links users proﬁles only
by their usernames. Liu[2] build behaviour similarity model and structure information model,
and use multi-objective optimization with missing information to identify linkage across social
networks. Zhang[7] also propose a energy-based model to address this problem by preserving
both local and global structure consistency across multiple networks.

The Overview of MUSIC Framework

MUSIC framework consists of the following steps:
1) building content style vector of users based on their message. First, we build word vector
space based on message all users have posted. Second, we build document vector space. All of

message that a user has posted form a document of this user. The document vector of a user
represents a single users content style features. The document vector space is vector space of
all users’ document vector. We use Word2vec[3] to build user’s word vector. And there are
two methods to build ones document vector: 1) mean-pooling: sum the word vector of users
message, and get the average value as the document vector; 2) doc2vec[1].
2) Identify whether this user account is SA or MA? We can formulate the problem as a
binary classiﬁcation problem. We use classiﬁcation method to ﬁnd the diﬀerence between SA
and MA in a single social network. After we get content style vector of users, we point out SA
and Ma have diﬀerent content style model in a single social network based on the hypothesis.
So we can use classiﬁcation method to identify MA users in a single social network.

Experiments

First, we verify whether MUSIC can learn an accurate identiﬁcation function. Second, we
examine the inﬂuence of classiﬁcation method, message content, and document vector model
on identiﬁcation performance.
Google+ allow users to provide other social network accounts. We chose user accounts from
google+ who are linked with Twitter and Facebook as the ground truth data. The collected
user accounts are considered as positive instances. We get negative instances by randomly
collecting user accounts from each social networks and guarantee they are not from the same
individual. Table 2 summarizes statistical information about user accounts.

First, we divide all users message into four groups: 1) message including post, retweet,
review, link anchors, and expression signal; 2) message only written in Chinese; 3) only original
posts; 4) only original posts written in Chinese. The following process includes: 1) Get word
vector based on Word2vec; 2) Get document vector based on mean-pooling or Doc2vec; 3) use
classiﬁcation methods (Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbours, Decision Trees, and SVM )to
divide user accounts into two classes in a single social network.
We use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate each classiﬁer by Precision(the number of true
MA divided by the total number of user accounts labeled as MA), Recall(the number of
true MA divided by the total number of user accounts that actually belong to MA), and
F1-Measure(F 1 = 2 ∗ (P recision ∗ Recall)/(P recision + Recall)).
Table 3 list 10 comparison pairs. Table 4 shows the performance of these classiﬁcation methods using mean-pooling&Word2vec and it shows that Logistic Regression and SVM achieves
better performance than other methods. The third comparison pair of Twitter, Google+, and
Facebook have better performance than other pairs. It demonstrates that this method can
provide better performance if only examining whether a user account is SA or MA.

All classiﬁcation methods have better performance on Twitter and Google+. The reason
is there are some diﬀerence between these social networks. Facebook can be considered as a
network for friends and family and its connections are often result of some kind of ”oﬄine”
relationships. However, Twitter can be seen as a network of strangers. Google+ is more similar
to Twitter in the view of content sharing. To our knowledge, the newest progress was proposed
by Zhang [7]. The highest F1-scores his method can reach is 86.38. Our methods can provide
similar performance; although, we research on diﬀerent social networks. Our method get higher
F1-scores(89.25) when only checking whether a user account is MA or SA.
The inﬂuence of content on identiﬁcation is showed on Figure1. All message and original
message provide similar performance in all tasks. But message written in Chinese get relatively
bad results. Performance Comparison between mean-pooling&Word2vec and Doc2vec is showed
on Figure 2. The results show that the performance of Doc2vec is not comparable with that of
mean-pooling&Word2vec. The reason may be Doc2vec also consider the order of words.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose MUSIC to identify user accounts across social networks by building
users content style model based on users message and reducing this problem to classiﬁcation
problem on a single social network. MUSIC can achieve at least 74.0 F1-score and can get 89.3
F1-score when only checking whether a user has multiple user accounts across social networks.
