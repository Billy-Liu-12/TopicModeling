Abstract
Detecting and tracking extreme events in gridded climatological data is a challenging problem
on several fronts: algorithms, scalability, and I/O. Successful detection of these events will give
climate scientists an alternate view of the behavior of diﬀerent climatological variables, leading
to enhanced scientiﬁc understanding of the impacts of events such as heat and cold waves, and
on a larger scale, the El Ni˜
no Southern Oscillation. Recent advances in computing power and
research in data sciences enabled us to look at this problem with a diﬀerent perspective from
what was previously possible. In this paper we present our computationally eﬃcient algorithms
for anomalous cluster detection on climate change big data. We provide results on detection
and tracking of surface temperature and geopotential height anomalies, a trend analysis, and a
study of relationships between the variables. We also identify the limitations of our approaches,
future directions for research and alternate approaches.

Introduction

Extreme climatic events include phenomena such as heat waves, cold waves, ﬂoods and cyclones.
According to [11], “it is very likely that frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts
of Europe, Asia and Australia”. To predict the occurrence of extreme events and mitigate
their impact on economy and human life, there is an increasing need to study climate data.
Techniques to ﬁnd anomalous behavior are often called anomaly detection.

1.1

Problem Description

Ways to detect clusters of similar behavior include density and correlation-based techniques
among others [6] [7]. Some of these methods can be extended to be applied on data of spatial
and/or temporal nature [10]. One of the open problems in this domain is to detect and track
extreme events through space and time.

The task is made harder by spatial and temporal
context introduced by locality. Figure 1 represents data
for one day, comprised of 10,512 discrete spatial samples. Considering a history of 35 years approximately
comes to 134 million values. These values are from
the sampling of NCEP Reanalysis data provided by
the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA
(http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/) [4]. The data are
represented in a 73x144 gridded format (2.5 by 2.5 latitude longitude). The computational and I/O challenges
are huge as the spatio-temporal methods used are more Figure 1:

detection. Cluster detection is nicely stated in Neill’s
thesis [9]; in clustering the number of clusters is almost always previously speciﬁed whereas
in cluster detection, whether there exist anomalous clusters or not is in itself an important
question. Anomaly detection focuses on point anomalies but cluster detection searches for
collective (grouped point) anomalies. A set of similarly hot anomalous values that are spatially
close could be indicative of a heat wave. The fact that we are interested in groups of anomalies
rather than point anomalies poses an additional computational challenge. Point anomalies
might be coincidences or artifacts that were introduced during data preprocessing [2] but this
is less likely for spatially and temporally contiguous (or groups of) anomalies.

1.2

Our Contributions

The main idea of our work is to use statistical learning techniques to build a pipeline for analysis
of climate extremes. We have chosen to work with “height of the 500 millibar atmospheric
pressure level” (which will henceforth be referred to as Z500) and “near-surface temperature”
(which will henceforth be referred to as Tsfc). The Z500 level is thought to be higher in the
atmosphere when the temperature in the column below is relatively higher, causing the air to
expand. Similarly, a low Z500 level is thought to correspond to colder air in the column below.
The computational approach that we developed leverages the concept of pure temporal analysis
in the ﬁrst step while ignoring spatial autocorrelation.

Methods Used

Our approach uses a purely temporal analysis documented in [8] to detect point anomalies.
This is followed by a connected components analysis to detect the grouped anomalies. Consequently, we mine information about these anomalous regions in order to better characterize
their properties.

2.1

Purely Temporal Analysis

The concept of temporal neighborhood is utilized; the value of a variable at a particular location
on a given day is candidate for comparison with values at the same location on days immediately
preceding and following it and the same window of days of other years. This is justiﬁed as we
are concerned primarily with how the tails of the distribution change over space and time, not
with change around the mean[5].

We considered a 5-day window centered on a calendar day. Over 35 years, this yields a set
of 174 values (excluding the one under observation) for comparison for each day of the year.
The mean of these values is considered the long-term mean for this particular location. We say
that the location on the day observed experiences anomalous behavior if the temperature lies
in the tails of these 175 values. The anomaly score for each location and day of the year is
computed by subtracting its long-term mean. We used diﬀerent percentile thresholds ranging
in {10, 90}, {5, 95} and {1, 99} in order to provide a richer picture of behavior. Two-tailed
percentiles were always used as both hot and cold anomalous events are of interest to us.

2.2

Connected Components Analysis

Connected components analysis [1] is a well known image processing technique to identify groups distinctly. We create an
anomaly mask, then iterate through the gridded data row
wise and examine each grid cell’s immediate eight surrounding neighbors for contiguity and stop when a stable grouping
is conﬁrmed.
Since our way to iterate through the data is restricted to a
ﬁxed order (row wise), a group of anomalies could need many
iterations of the data before we can conclude that we have

ple outline represents the contiguous anomalous group to be
discovered, say a heat wave. For the case of point A, we have
no problem recognizing the values on this row as participants of the anomalous region. For
point B, clearly its left neighbor is anomalous, but it is not possible to link to point C without
analysis of subsequent rows.

2.3

Extracting Properties of Anomalous Regions

To capture properties of anomalous regions, we identiﬁed four essential properties - surface area,
magnitude, duration and frequency. The surface area and magnitude properties are relatively
straightforward to compute. Mining frequency is also a straightforward counting procedure that
follows naturally from Section 2.2. To track regions through space and time to infer duration,
we used an algorithm based on the simple idea of “surface area overlap”. If a certain percentage
of surface area enclosed in anomalous region A on day i is also present in an anomalous region
B on day i + 1, we say A and B are part of the same “extreme event”. Overview of key details:
• Colors are used analogous to unique identiﬁers on a given day, so tracing a color studies
the duration of an extreme event.
• Assume a maximum number of cold and hot regions on a given day (conservative estimate)
in order to prevent unbounded usage of number (color) space.
• Regions can be of any shape and size.
• An anomalous region may have only one successor but a successor may have more than
one predecessor.

Uncovering Relationships

We employed a combination of trend analysis and co-incidence mining to ﬁnd relationships
between the variables.

frequency, surface area and duration. Sign and signiﬁcance are shown (gray boxes; p-value <
0.05) and 0 denotes no signiﬁcant linear trend.
We aggregated the properties found in Section 2.3 annually to perform a trend analysis.
Segmenting the trend analysis into the 4 seasons of the year corresponding to winter (Dec/Jan/Feb), spring (MAM), summer (JJA) and autumn (SON) is common practice as the behavior
of extremes is known to diﬀer greatly among diﬀerent seasons. T-tests were performed at the
95% signiﬁcance level to test for the signiﬁcance of linear relationships between each property
and time. The results are summarized in Table 1 and observations from it are:
• Magnitude of cold tail events has “warmed” for both variables across all seasons.
• Magnitude of Z500 warm tail events has only increased in summer and fall.
• Fewer (more) cold (warm) tail events for both Z500 and Tsfc across all seasons.

3.2

Co-incidence Patterns

We studied co-location on a
ﬁne-grained scale by creating
a heat map of co-location fractions for each grid cell. Figure 3 shows the heat maps.
Each grid cell has the number
of times both Tsfc and Z500
extremes occurred divided by
the number of times only a
Z500 extreme occurred. We
observe that extreme events
are more “stacked” in summer, corresponding to the
northward retreat of the jet
stream, less ampliﬁed ridges
and troughs compared to winter, and a more “equivalent
barotropic” pattern.

Conclusions and Future Work

In this work, we created a computational pipeline to study extreme events in historical climate
change big data. Having this modular pipeline means that for future analysis we can swap
the individual components with better approaches. Our analysis produced results that were
not only in agreement with previously published research results, but also novel. Stacking of
extreme events in the summer over the western part of North America is especially interesting.
Initial analysis validates our results with extreme events recorded in history [3]. However,
these methods do not account for spatial autocorrelation as they consider each grid cell separately, without accounting for neighbors. Our accuracy was compromised a little as we excluded
the ﬁrst two and last two days of every year in considering the 5 day windows to save some
computation. We also lost a little information as the neighborhood for locations along a grid’s
edge were excluded from the analysis to also save some compute time. The co-incidence mining methodology can be improved by accounting for spatial and temporal lags in addition to
studying co-locations between events rather than each grid cell separately.
