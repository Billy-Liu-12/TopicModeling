Abstract
The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the development of complex model of clinical episode,
based on data-driven approach, for decision support in treatment of ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome).
The idea is aimed at improving predictive capability of a data-driven model by combining different
models within a composite data-driven model. It can be implemented either hierarchical or alternative
combination of models. Three examples of data-driven models are described: simple classifier, outcome
prediction based on reanimation time and states-based prediction model, to be used as part of complex
model of episodes. To implement the proposed approach, a generalized architecture of data-driven
clinical decision support systems was developed. The solution is developed as a part of complex clinical
decision support system for cardiac diseases for Federal Almazov North-West Medical Research Centre
in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
Keywords:data-driven modeling, decision support system, clinical DSS, personalized medicine, p4 medicine

1 Introduction
Acute coronary syndrome is one of the common form of heart diseases which causes immediate
death, worldwide. Following appropriate medical treatment strategy, as soon as the patient admits to the
hospital, is essential for best outcomes. However, the unfavorable circumstances while making decision
such as insufficient objective data and lack of time are common in contemporary medical practices.
Medical treatment outcomes are characterized by a number of factors, ranging from patients’ survival
rate to duration of treatment and cost of used methods, which reflect economic aspects of the problem.

The strategy of managing ACS patients is defined in detail by ESC Guidelines [1], [2]. Nevertheless,
each individual cases have their own features which in turn require specific decision making process
and are not regulated by the recommendations based on a wide interpretation and extrapolation of
scientific data and personal clinical experience of the doctor. Modeling ACS medical emergency
patients can be extended by including cases which demand intensive care, because this stage obliges
resolution of main issues such as diagnosis, determining treatment strategy, high risk of complications
and significant economic costs. Infrequent outcomes are analyzed based on the details of treatment
considering the stay in various departments and in-hospital logistics. However, analysis of the data
accumulated in the hospital information systems opens up new possibilities of seeing these aspects of
acute cardiac care from different angle [3]. Therefore, decision making support in the treatment of
patients with ACS is a very important issue which requires effective models. One of the popular models
is Cox model or proportional hazards model [4]. This model allows us to predict a risk of certain events
and the influence covariates have on this risk. Cox model is based on the assumption that a risk function
can be described as the basic hazard rate function and the function of covariates which affects
multiplicatively the resulting risk. Typical medical covariates are treatment assignment and patient
characteristics such as age, gender, and other diseases at the start of treatment.
Phase-type (Ph) distributions [5] area is a popular way to model how long a patient stay (LOS,
Length of stay) in a hospital [6]. Ph-distributions is the distribution of time in a finite-state Markov chain
with only one absorbing state and where process starts at a random transient state. In this model time is
represented as a sequence of phases and terminates when the process reaches an absorbing state. Various
machine-learning and data-mining models provide powerful tools for clinical predictions [7][8]. They
are widely used for medical diagnosis [9], LOS prediction [10], [11], event prediction [12], [13],
prediction of need for life-saving interventions [14] and many others.
There are several works which describe ways how different approaches can be joined into one to get
better results. [15] describes an approach of Conditional phase-type distributions for task of LOS
modeling, which combines the use of Ph-distributions and Bayesian belief networks. [12] proposes an
integrated approach for stroke prediction including a systematic method for imputing the missing
entries, selecting relevant feature subsets, and the Margin-based Censored Regression.
Single models show good results in a single variable prediction but ineffective when we do not have
full information at the moment of prediction. Another difficulty is the fact that a patient may face many
clinical events (more details provided in Section 2.5), and a model should take parameters of these
events into account. Simple extensions of the set of features of models may be ineffective since only
few of many possible events can happen with a single patient, and passing all of them as models’
parameters may add much noise.
In our work we propose the idea of a complex model of clinical episode, based on data-driven
approach for decision making support in ACS treatment. Our model will use some models’ output as
inputs for possible early prediction, when full data for prediction is unavailable; it will take into account
incoming data about various medical events or procedures which are difficult to predict at the time of
patient’s admission to the hospital.

2 Model of a clinical episode
2.1 Problem statements
Federal Almazov North-West Medical Research Center has an opportunity to access depersonalized
cards of the patients who had acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These cards were used in our analysis.
Electronic Medical Records (EMR) reflect clinical records of a patient and contain information about
all cases of patient's treatment or complaints to the medical institution. EMR of a patient is a collection
of clinical incident (ambulatory, stationary) and various tickets (or cards) for medical assistance. Our

research is focused on the stationary episodes’ information. Such episodes, in turn, are characterized by
a combination of the following data:
x
x
x

General information about patient: age, gender, addictions, allergies, other existing diseases,
their relatives̓ diseases and other data demanded upon arrival to the hospital.
Medical checkup by a doctor (patients̓ information at the time of reception): blood pressure,
temperature, height, weight, test results at the time of admission, etc.
Data about various medical events or procedures: surgery, resuscitation, transfers to other
departments, clinical test results, examinations by doctors, prescriptions, therapy, etc.

Fig. 1 shows a visualization of the Electronic Medical Records. At the top, patients’ data about all
treatment cases in medical facilities are displayed. A current episode is highlighted in red. Trend lines
show the information for a selected episode such as different medical events and tests’ results carried
out in the hospital. Besides to these, additional information about the episode is reflected in a yellow
box: starting time, ending time, total duration of the episode, EuroScore value [16] (in cases of
emergency coronary artery bypass grafting), when a patient admits to and discharges from hospital.

Figure 1:Visualization of Episode Records

As it was mentioned earlier there are a lot of possible targets for prediction models, such as predicting
possible patients' hospitalization outcomes, length of stay, risks of complications, a need for life-saving
interventions, and many others. This question will be discussed in Section 4 in details.

2.2 Model structure
The main idea of the proposed approach is combining different data-driven models and procedures
within a complex data-driven model with improved predictive capability. The complex model can be
used within a decision support system to estimate various risks, probabilities of unwanted events (e.g.
clinical death, complications etc.) and forecast future development of the clinical episode. The Figure 2
here below shows the generalized conceptual structure of information processing within a complex
model.

Figure 2: Information processing within a complex model

The initial dataset that we feed to the model is the clinical history of patients (from date of admission
to date) mainly stored in electronic medical records with possible supplementary materials for instance
hand-written documents and surveys. It includes general information about the patient (age, gender,
physical conditions etc.) and current clinical case (anamnesis, diagnosis, conditions of case initialization
etc.); clinical history related to the current case (surgeries, treatments, conclusions from different doctors
etc.) as well as all clinical tests and diagnostics.
This information infers and reconstructs actual history of the case and the patient. This procedure
may require additional data processing, heuristic-based control and intelligent inference (including rulebased processing) as raw records in database may contains erroneous, contradictive and incomplete
materials. In many cases such processing can extend, filtering and correcting the initial data,
reconstructing missing records, identifying states of the patient (including current patient status (e.g. on
reanimation, in hospital, on restorative therapy etc.), department of clinic which curates the patient with,
and others). An important issue is the detection of important events happened to the patient and referred
as direct mentioning in electronic card or by indirect inference (in case the direct mentioning is missing).
The reconstructed information can be used for checking and fixing (if necessary) the raw database
structure.
Finally, the rebuilt and extended information can be used to estimate current and future risks, event
complications and to forecast future development of a current case. The important aspect of this
approach is dynamic update of predictions with new incoming data (e.g. new results of clinical tests)
which can be considered as data assimilation for the purpose of patient model’s refinement.
To implement the prediction process, data-driven models can be combined within the complex model
in a various way: as alternative models which can be aggregated or switched (e.g. using ensemble-based
approach or with higher-level control model), as hierarchical composition where output of the model is
used with another model. In general, a workflow-like graph structure can be defined using data-driven
models. This workflow can be further translated into data-analytical procedure to be trained using
extended dataset for similar patients (e.g. it can be implemented using data-analytics technology [17]).

2.3 States and Transfers
One possible way of simulating a clinical episode is to think about the patient's flow as a series of
transitions through a set of states that correspond to the phases of patient's treatment in the hospital.
Based on EMR analysis (see Section 2.1) the following states of patient in hospital could be determined:
x
x
x
x

INHOSPITAL: it starts at the moment of the patient's registration in the hospital.
SURGERY: it starts when a patient is in surgery.
RESUSCITATION: it starts when a patient is in intensive care unit.
HOSPITAL: it starts when a patient is transferred from intensive care to therapy

The state INHOSPITAL is very specific. In general, every patient’s flow starts from it. However, in
the case of emergency hospitalization this state lasts for a short period of time because in this case the
patient should be transferred to surgery or intensive care unit as quickly as possible. Besides to this, we
consider various situations such as:
x
x

Arrivals: PLANNED - refers to planned hospitalization, EMERGENCY - refers to
emergency hospitalization, RELOCATION - refers to transfer from another hospital.
Outcomes: HOME – refers to patient discharged home, FURTHER THERAPY – refers to
patient demands additional treatment and DEATH – refers to patient’s death. Moreover,
according to Medical doctors’ prescription we define possible transfers between patient’s
states in the hospital (see fig. 3).

2.4 Clinical tests’ analysis
The main goal of clinical tests’ analysis for our research is monitoring and anomaly detection.
Anomaly or outlier is an observation (or subset of observations) which appears to be inconsistent with
the remainder of that set of data. One of the applications that use outlier detection is medical condition
monitoring is heart-rate monitoring [18].
Therefore, to identify those outliers and develop a model that can be used to monitor, detect and
notify unusual events of ACS patient, we have analyzed each patient's data separately given the time
they were treated. There are three major methodologies of outlier detection: 1) Determine the outliers
with no prior knowledge of the data which is similar to unsupervised outliers detection. 2) Model both
typicality and irregularity which is practically equivalent to supervised outliers’ detection and requires
pre-labeled data, labeled as expected or strange. 3) Model only normality which is analogous to a semisupervised outliers’ detection [18]. We have used all the above methods as follows.
Out of several clinical tests, we have selected the following tests based on Medical doctors'
recommendation. These tests are 1) Hemoglobin which is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in
grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood [19], 2) Transaminases or aminotransferases (which
include Aspartate and Alanine) are group of enzymes that are normally present in liver and heart cells
and expressed as units per liter of serum, the liquid part of the blood [20], and 3) Creatinine is a chemical
waste molecule that is generated from muscle metabolism and its level is expressed as milligrams (mg)
per deciliter (dL) [21]. In addition to this, we have identified outliers based on the range (min and max),
which is semi-supervised outliers’ detection method. Each patient has its own range which is defined
considering different factors such as gender and age. We have also used inter-quartiles (The IQR tells
how spread out the "middle" values are; it can also be used to tell when some of the other values are
"too far" from the central value), which is the unsupervised outliers detection method. Therefore, those
patients who are below the min and above the max are considered to be outliers [22].

2.5 Events’ inference
In most cases, changes in different health indicators are normal for this disease and patients infected
with ACS, even if they show deterioration of the patient’s condition, and cannot significantly change
initial forecast. But, in some cases, changes could indicate certain events that are not expected and
forecasts should be refined according to new information.
Therefore, using the following set of rule-based events we can detect outliers and use them in the
prediction model for monitoring ACS patients.
1) If the amount of Hemoglobin of ACS patient decreased by 30 g/L and above from the previous
test, it means that there is bleeding (usually during surgery).
2) If the amount of Creatinine of ACS patient increased by 20% of mkmol/L within 48 hours, it
means that there is Nephropathy.
3) If the amount of Alanine transaminase increased by 200% of IU/L from the previous test.
4) If the amount of Aspartate transaminase increased by 200% from the previous test.

5) If Clinical death happens, it means that ventricular fibrillation.
6) If the patient has Heart failure of 4th functional class, it means that Killip 3-4.

2.6 Data assimilation and prediction
When the patient arrives at the hospital, we can make some forecasts based on past records of
patient’s state (see Section 2.1, General information about the patient) but still we do not have a lot of
uncertainty. Certain degree of uncertainty can be reduced as patient's condition changes during the
treatment. By taking these changes into consideration, we can refine forecasts each time, whenever a
new event occurs.
Keeping in mind that, certain event, e.g. increase of Creatinine by 20% within 48 hours which
indicates the deterioration of the patient, we can configure two models - one for all patients, another - for
patients with problems described earlier. Then, if the system gets a signal from clinical tests analysis
(see Section 2.4) about this event, the model will be customized to a more suitable form to handle this
event of a specific patient.

Figure 4: An example of the data assimilation.
Our estimates for outcomes probabilities changes after receiving an event at the 200 hour

Considering the example, given time spent by a patient in reanimation, one of the simplest datadriven models is the empirical conditional distribution of the outcomes. Probabilities of specific
outcomes after the reanimation time are greater than some values according the Bayesian rule:
ܲ‫ܾ݋ݎ‬ሺȁ௥௘௔௡௜௠ ൒ ‫ݐ‬ሻ ൌ

௉௥௢௕ሺ୓୳୲ୡ୭୫ୣǡ୘ೝ೐ೌ೙೔೘ ஹ௧ሻ
௉௥௢௕ሺ୘ೝ೐ೌ೙೔೘ಱ೟ ሻ

,

where Outcome is one of the outcomes named in Section 2.3.
Fig. 4 shows that after receiving the event (the dotted line on 200 hours point) re-estimated
probabilities indicates that the patient has less chance to be discharged but high chance of death.

3 Case study
3.1 Description of the data set
To implement the proposed approach, we used dataset provided by Federal Almazov North-West
Medical Research Centre. This dataset contains 3980 episodes with resuscitation related to heart
diseases (with significant portion of ACS episodes) for the year 2014. Each episode is represented as
xml file and includes reception information (basic patient metrics, channels of intake and delivery),
doctor’s diaries, laboratory analyzes, surgery reports, hospitalization outcome, drugs that were used, etc.
When we see the statistics based on arrival, Planned hospitalization takes the lion share with 63%
whereas Urgent arrival, Emergency arrival, Transfer from another health care facility counts 17%, 11%,

523

Complex data-driven predictive modeling in personalized CDS

9%, respectively. On the other hand, the statistics based on hospitalization outcomes can be summarized
as follows: Improvement- 89%, Without changes- 4.8%, Death- 0.9%, Recovery- 0.2%,
Deterioration- 0.2%, and No data- 4.9%. In addition to this, the statistics based on income shows that
Medical-diagnostic counts 54% and Surgical treatment counts 46%. Despite the large amount of data
available for analysis, extracting information about the episode (described in Section 2.1) is a complex
and ambiguous process. This is due to several reasons such as there is no commonality in filling the
information, missing values, and incorrect values which in turn, in addition with some other factors,
made identification of the full patient’s information as well as clear boundaries of states very
challenging.
It has been noticed that, sometimes, one case of the patient’s treatment in the hospital might be
divided into several different episodes. It is, therefore, necessary to consider all identified data features
while constructing a model, for example, to identify and combine the episodes, constituting one case.

3.2 Data management architecture
For the case on hand, one of the main goals of data-driven approach application is development of
decision support systems. For these purposes, the architecture of data-driven clinical DSS was developed
on the basis of the approach proposed earlier in [23].
Fig. 5 shows the high-level architecture of data-driven DSS integrated with MIS and distributed
environment for data storing and processing. The architecture is focused on data-driven model package
which implements a workflow of data-driven models, enabling to extend the facts and predict future
development of personalized clinical episode. The architecture integration is implemented using several
services which can be run by request, executed periodically according to a predefined schedule, or fired
by incoming event (e.g. update of personal data). An array of personal medical records is available in
the dataset collected from medical information system, database with medical records and external data
sources. The data extraction and data collection services are responsible for unification and collection
of the data, pre-processing, cleaning and extension of the data to be stored in data storage.

Figure 5: Data-driven clinical DSS architecture

The data storage resided in a distributed cloud environment is based on CLAVIRE platform which
supports distributed data processing [17]. The collected dataset is used to build, train and re-train the
data-driven models within the package. The main purpose of the model within a context of decision
making is to provide estimations of states and risks, and probabilistic forecasting of situation
development. In addition to this, the DSS should provide the ability to search for similar medical records
and shows their statistical analysis with relation to the current patient’s state (which can be done either
by user request or automatically). Two user roles are considered within the proposed architecture. These
are Doctor who is using the DSS and data analyst who is responsible for development of the data-driven
model package, set up a model training procedure, fill in the rule base for data processing and deploy
the model into distributed computing environment.

3.3 Episode model application
As it was mentioned in the introduction, our main goal is to build a model that will include different
data-driven models to make joint forecasts about the patient’s treatment. We conducted a series of
experiments trying different ways to combine multiple models into one. In our current study we focused
on prediction of LOS and probabilities of patient outcomes.
а) Simple classifier
First of all, we built a model using Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM). The features used in
this model are described in Table 1. Both, reanimation and LOS times in dataset were divided in 5
groups (see Table 2 for details). Each group is a possible class of reanimation time and LOS. We
partitioned the data set into a training set and a testing set; 80% of the data (1,856 records) was used for
training, and 20% of the data (464 records) was used for testing.
According to cross validation SVM mean [std], accuracy for patient’s outcome prediction is
0.65 [0.02], for patient’s reanimation time 0.89 [0.041] and for the patient LOS is 0.56 [0.064].

b) Using reanimation time forecast as input for outcome prediction
As you can see from the above experiment, the accuracy of outcome predictions is not significantly
better than simple guessing. However, we can predict time in reanimation rather well. Having
probabilistic prediction of the reanimation time (using BNB), conditional distribution of outcomes, and
given time in reanimation, we can make probabilistic forecasts of the outcome according to the next
rule:
Զॹ ൌ Զ൫এหঔ൯ Զঔ ,
whereԶॹ - vector of probabilities of the outcomes (Զ௜ॹ – probability of the ith outcome), - vector of
probabilities of the reanimation time segment, and Զ൫এหঔ൯ – is the matrix of conditional outcome
௜ǡ௝

probabilities given the reanimation time (Զ൫এหঔ൯ - probability of outcome i given reanimation time j). In
this experiment, we have achieved an accuracy of 0.54 [0.02] which is fairly closer to the first
experiment. In fact, this result is even worse than the results of SVM, most likely due to the cumulative
uncertainty in result of multiple prediction steps (prediction of the reanimation time, than prediction of
the outcome). But, this approach allows us to make data- and events-assimilations. In this case we can
reforecast changing the matrix P at some events (see Section 2.6).
c) States-based patient LOS prediction

525

Complex data-driven predictive modeling in personalized CDS

Alexey V. Krikunov et al.

One possible way to model LOS is to use a ph-distribution, which is modeling patients’ flow as a
series of transitions through a set of states. The way how we can assimilate new events in the
probabilistic model is to use conditional distributions in the states of ph-distribution model. When an
event arrives, we can re-estimate possible LOS of this patient by constructing a new ph-distribution
using the pre-defined set of conditional distributions of time for each state (see Section 2.6). Usually
ph-distribution assumes only latent states, but in our case the states structure is known (see Section 2.3)
and parameters of the model can be estimated directly from the available data. Moreover, in our study
we are faced with the problem such as inaccurate data and missing data. As a result, Fig. 6 illustrates
that the obtained distribution does not fit the actual data.

Figure 6: LOS modeling by ph-distributionbuilt using values obtained from data.
Red line shows obtained by the Ph-model PDF, green-line estimated PDF

Using the EM-algorithm (in our study we have used EMpth [24] which is proposed by S.Asmussen
[25]) we tried to fit actual data by ph-distribution using prior knowledge retrieved from the data to
define structure of the transition matrix T (defining constraints for transitions between states) and to set
the initial values. It gives better approximation (fig.7) but it is still not perfect: the main peak is not
correct and in the area of 250-400 is missing some important behavior.

Figure 7:LOS modeling by ph-distribution fitted using EM-algorithm.
Red line shows obtained by the Ph-model PDF, green-line estimated PDF

Since any distribution on [0, ∞) can be approximated arbitrarily close by a phase-type
distribution [25], actual LOS distribution can be well-fitted e.g. by adding more states and by removing
constraints from the transition matrix. But in such case it is much harder to interpret a derived ph-model
(even if it is possible), and what is more important is that it looks very hard to use assimilation of
incoming events, that is natural in the case of real-states model.

4 Discussion
One of the aims of the complex model is using predictions of some models as input data for another
model. In some cases, we can use simulation models or in combination with them. E.g. simulation of
stenosis [26] can provide important information for decision making in case of stent implantation and
further therapy of patients during ACS treatment.
An important issue for decision support is selection of targets for prediction and forecasting. We
need to make additional analysis of the process of doctors’ decision making either based on expert
knowledge or using knowledge-mining techniques to retrieve this knowledge from the historical medical
records or within interactive knowledge acquisition procedures with doctors involved. It is even possible
that various clinical procedures and cases require different sets of predictions for same tasks.
P4 (personalized, predictive, preventive and participatory) medicine is the contemporary direction
of personalized medicine development [27]. The approaches used in this study almost fulfills the P4
concept, except “participatory” which should be included in future works.
According to the P4 concept, the main purpose of the proposed approach should be “preventive”
decision making. Therefore, prediction of the possible complications, deteriorations and other
undesirable events may help the doctor to take proactive action to prevent such kind of events in
advance.

5 Conclusions and Future Works
The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the idea of complex model of clinical episode,
based on data-driven approach for decision support in treatment of ACS. Three examples of models
were discussed and all of them exhibited unsatisfactory prediction results separately. This is why we
propose implementation of complex data-driven model by combining different models to improvement
of predictive capability. The proposed system can be implemented either hierarchical or alternative
combination of models. The solution is developed as a part of complex clinical decision support system
for cardiac diseases for Federal Almazov North-West Medical Research Centre in Saint Petersburg.
The work is on-going. Finally, we recommend that future works should include analysis of various
scenarios of data-driven models combinations, detailed work on knowledge acquisition to conform the
needs of practical tasks in ACS cases, further development of the system within a concept of P4
medicine, and more detailed experimental studies.
