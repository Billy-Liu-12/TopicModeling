Abstract
Banking systems, modelled with networks, evolve over time overcoming critical points.
Topology-oriented indicators of tipping points and early-warning signals of criticality in networks do not reﬂect the gradual movement of a system towards a tipping point. Plenty of
networks with SIR-like dynamics have restricted numbers of node states. In the case of banking networks, the range space of node states is continual, which allows an estimation of single
bank remoteness from an insolvent state. Remoteness and velocity reﬂect change in the state
per iteration and are considered in order to estimate the inﬂuence of node dynamics. Both
node dynamics and topology are taken into account. We consider the positive and negative
impact of interbank interactions (edge presence). Each edge is considered with weight and
length parameters corresponding to the size of interbank lending and the number of iterations
remaining before it expires. It was shown that the dropping well below zero of the presented
indicator, is referred to as the potential of interactions, is a sign of a forthcoming tipping point.
The introduced T -Threatened set allows the detection of an approaching a tipping point in
terms of nodes’ states.

Introduction

Banking systems often undergo small changes that can result in critical transition. The reasons
for such transitions can be diﬃcult to detect and eliminate, which obstructs the deﬁnition of
system states as robust or fragile, and consequently impede the determination of a certain point
where a phase transition occurs.
Existing indicators of tipping points and early-warning signals based on topological dynamics do not reﬂect the gradual movement of a system towards its tipping point. Using nodes
dynamics for such predictions can be obstructed for networks having SIR-like dynamics, because

they have a restricted number of nodes’ states. Nevertheless, in the case of banking networks,
the range space of nodes’ states is continual, which allows an estimation of a single bank remoteness from an insolvent state. To take into account both node dynamics and topology, we
consider pairs of nodes interactions, implying that edge can have both a positive and a negative impact. Each edge is considered with weight and length parameters corresponding to the
size of interbank lending and the number of iterations remaining before it expires. Each bank
represented by node is characterised by its state, velocity, and remoteness. Velocity reﬂects
changes of the state per iteration. Remoteness is the number of iterations, which are necessary
for a bank with current velocity and state to go bankrupt.
The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 2 some literature related to detecting
phase transitions and early-warning signals is observed. Then some deﬁnitions and a description
of our early-warning indicator, which uses both topology and node state dynamics, follows. The
results section presents some examples of application of implemented indicators to the model
of banking network.

Literature Review

In the current section we will review some literature deﬁning tipping points and describing
indicators for critical (or phase) transitions detection, which is widely discussed in scientiﬁc
literature dedicated to diﬀerent types of systems.
Some deﬁnitions of critical point for diﬀerent types of transitions in complex networks are
presented in [1]. Those deﬁnitions take into account network model assignment and approach,
which are going to be used. More general features are often based on the Landau theory of phase
transitions, and use energy-like and thermodynamic indicators, or are related to the spectral
graph theory or to the algebraic graph theory.
Seoane [8] considers a set of networks, being Pareto-optimal, as Gibbs surface formed by a
set of critical points, and deﬁnes global energy using some objective functions (taking a network
as an argument) and control parameter. Ye et al. deﬁnes entropy over a network Laplacian
spectrum, energy as the number of edges in a network and temperature as measure of entropy
and energy relative change during period between epochs. Ni and Lu [6] use the time series
of all node states to build a transfer entropy matrix [7] and show that the minimum of this
matrix’s spectral radius corresponds to a phase transition.
As for banking network early-warning signals, ﬁnancial indicators, such as rate ratio, bank
deposit, reserves, etc., or their weighted combinations are often observed as a measure of crisis
probability [5]. Some external features like world interest rate, foreign debt, and capital ﬂight
are considered by Gayt´an [2].
The results of the current research are designed for a dynamic network, where edges and
nodes can appear and disappear. In this research, we combine nodes states eﬀect with topological inﬂuence. Edges are considered as having both positive and negative impact. Positive
impact occurs if the edge disappears before nodes, so both nodes have time to advance their
states. If one of the nodes disappeared before the edge linking them, the edge serves as a
contagion conductor. To predict what will disappear ﬁrst, we analyse the node state dynamic
and compare the expected iteration of bankruptcy achievement with edge length1 . The ﬁnal
network feature, that is referred to as the potential of interaction, uses each edge contribution
evaluated as described above.

Indicators of Critical Transitions

Initial considerations.
Consider a dynamic network G(t) = (E, V ), where E =
{(i, j, w, l)|i, j ∈ V, w ∈ R, l ∈ N}, where w is weight of an edge and l is its length1 . Let
N be a number of nodes, let S(t) = (s1 (t), ..., sN (t)) be a state of the network, where si (t) is a
state of node at iteration t. Let s0 be the critical node state for some model. We will say that
a state of node is critical, if it leads to this node elimination. The deﬁnitions for the variables
of state dynamics are as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. Node velocity vi at iteration t determines the change of a node state per iteration
and is deﬁned as
(1)
vi (t) = si (t) − si (t − 1).
Deﬁnition 2. Node remoteness ri at iteration t determines a number of iterations which is
necessary for node of state si (t) having the velocity vi (t) to reach the value of its critical state
s0 , and deﬁned as
si (t) − s0
(2)
ri (t) =
|vi (t)|
It can be seen that velocities of nodes going towards the critical state are negative, and
those are positive for nodes receding from the critical state. Using those velocities we introduce
the function reﬂecting share of nodes having negative dynamics. To provide the possibility of
short-term and long-term forecasts, we take the expected iteration of defaults as an additional
parameter. Thus, the set containing all nodes going to reach their critical state in less than T
steps can be constructed. The fraction of this set cardinality to the number of nodes in the
network is used further in our analysis.
Deﬁnition 3. T -Threatened set of nodes DT (S) for the network of state S contains nodes
having negative velocity and remoteness, which is less than T .
DT (S) = i|si > s0 , vi < 0, ri < T

The potential of interaction: dynamics of states and topology.
To compose both
topological and node-state dynamics eﬀect we consider two nodes, having state, velocity and
remoteness as determinants of their dynamics, and an edge between these nodes, having weight
and length as its attributes. Edge weight corresponds to the interaction magnitude and aﬀect
the size of possible losses and proﬁts. Edge length corresponds to the number iterations before
it disappears from a network. Implying that links can have both negative and positive impact,
we consider two possible results of an interaction:
1) the edge disappears before one of the nodes disappears;
2) the edge disappears after one of the nodes disappears.
Fix two nodes n1 and n2 , described by (s1 (t), v1 (t), r1 (t)) and (s2 (t), v2 (t), r2 (t)), and edge
(1, 2, w, l), linking these nodes and disappearing in an l iterations. If l > min{r1 , r2 }, let
min{r1 , r2 } = r1 without loss of generality. This means that n1 is going to reach a critical state
ﬁrst, and contagion will spread to n2 . Then we estimate the magnitude of the contagion with
the sum of edge weight w and the ﬁrst node velocity v1 . The potential of interaction in this case

is estimated as the diﬀerence of expected remoteness for the case without n1 inﬂuence (r2 ) and
with it (r2 ). State of n2 at the moment, when n1 reaches s0 , is s2 − r1 · |v2 |, then, considering
expected losses,
s2 − r1 · |v2 | − (|v1 | + w)

r2 =

As r2 = r2 − r1 , so

In the current work we have also used thermodynamic topological features presented in [9]

Applying to banking network model. All indicators described above were applied to the
model of banking network described in detail in [3]. Banks are represented by nodes, interbank
lending is represented by edges. Bank policy and behaviour aﬀect dynamics occurring in the
network, namely states of nodes, edges appearing and disappearing, edge weights and lengths.
Since the model bank is insolvent if its net worth or available funds are negative, we will
consider state variables with corresponding velocities and remoteness for both of them (sN W
for the value of net worth, sAF for the value of available funds). Since we imply bank to be
W

= 0.
insolvent if any of its state variable is negative, ﬁx critical state values: sN

Results

In the current section, several examples of the application of the indicators presented are observed. Firstly, we consider a case where the system tends to the state with avalanches indicated
by ﬁrst bankrupts. Secondly, we modiﬁed bank behaviour parameters to provide system convergence to the steady state. Convergence to some value (or ﬂuctuation near it) is reﬂected by
the majority of indicators considered for the system. There are 500 banks, 11,000 customers for
the examples considered, and average number of interbank lending after initialization is about
38,000. The values of T emperature for all presented plots were multiplied by 1000.
The ﬁrst example was being modelled for about 350 iterations, and it can be observed that
there were no bankrupts for the ﬁrst 200 iteration. The ﬁrst bankruptcy initiates avalanches
resulting in all banks insolvency up to the 350 iteration. Initial parameters of bank policies for
this scenario provide bankrupt negative inﬂuence on other nodes’ states. This impact does not
guarantee an avalanche, but substantially brings the network closer to its critical state.
The Borrows plot (ﬁg. 1) reﬂects how much interbank activity is established when node
state is close to the critical one. Thus, it seems that the ﬁrst bankruptcy did not aﬀect other

its minimum by the 300 iteration, when the share of bankruptcies is 8%. T emperature (ﬁg. 3)
negligibly ﬂuctuates near some value and shows dramatically increase of amplitude between
250 and 300 iteration. As mentioned above, the observed scenario has negative dynamics after
the ﬁrst iterations. Each node of the model contains parameter deteriorating its state on each
iteration. While no one have bankrupted system converges to crisis slow. Bankruptcy aﬀects
the change of that parameter, whereupon nodes converge to their critical states faster. At
the same time, share of T -Threatened nodes, where T = 400 shows increase of nodes having
negative velocity after 170 iteration, that can be used as early warning signal.
The phase diagrams (ﬁg. 4) show mutual dynamics for the potential of interaction for states
represented by available funds on the X axis and by net worth on the Y axis. The second
diagram displays mutual dynamics of the corresponding velocities. One can see, the velocities
show slight change up to 200 iteration, and then make a sharp U-turn.

The second example (ﬁg. 5b–5c) ) demonstrates a more steep surge for the number of
bankruptcies, as customers are more likely to borrow funds than to invest since 50 iteration
of modeling. Consequently banks tends to have more external assets, that aﬀect substantial
decrease in available funds according to the model organisation presented in [3]. Nevertheless,
one can see early warning signal from the P otentialOf Interaction at 150 iteration, and more
crucial signals since 250 iteration.

Conclusion and Future Work

A combination of node states dynamics and topology was used as an early-warning indicator
of the critical transition for banking network model. Results show that there are some cases
when a consideration of node states dynamics is rather appropriate as an early warning signal of
criticality. T -Threatened set of nodes showed positive predicting capability with opportunity
for accuracy tuning. The potential of interaction reacted in a dozens of iterations before the ﬁrst
bankruptcy, that seems to be positive result, especially for the cases when the ﬁrst bankruptcy
initiates only a sharply dive of the nodes’ states, but does not initiate any avalanche.
At the same time, banking systems are close, which prevents reasons of distress from being
followed or disclosed. As a consequence, there are cases when there are no observable variables
that are able to provide appropriate information for predictions. In these cases topologyoriented indicators seem to be more appropriate.
Many systems being modelled with networks have ﬁnite number of nodes’ states. It seems
that those can be considered as special case of the presented model. Thus, the potential of
interaction could be applied for those too.
As usage of observable change of velocities seems to have an element of chance, we are to
generalize the result for an arbitrary law of node state dynamics in our future work.
In addition, it is necessary to tune the potential of interaction indicator to make it appropriate for an arbitrary kind of modelling scenario.
