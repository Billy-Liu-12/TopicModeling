Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of the learning activities on the final grades in students in engineering
education. A principal component analysis is carried out on the undergraduate “Stochastic Models”
course. We have determine that the first principal component has a positive correlation with the score
of the final written cumulative exam. This could possibly mean that the final exam could be eliminated
from the engineering curricula, but the variability is significant as measured by the correlation R statistic.
Based on information gathered on a much larger sample, we found that the variability has increased,
indicating changes in the course and students’ emphasis in learning activities. Therefore it can be
concluded that the evidence presented does not justify eliminating written cumulative final exams.
Keywords: Principal Component Analysis, Course Design, Learning Activities, Evaluation, Learning Analytics

1 Introduction
In education, the necessity of homework, exams and other learning activities has been questioned by
teachers, parents and students for a very long time. Some people believe homework is unnecessary while
others believe they are indispensable. The same can be said about written cumulative exams. While few
people question the necessity and validity of partial exams, many question the need and/or the value of
final exams. Recently, in (Ramirez-Velarde, Sanhueza-Olave, Alexandrov, & De Marcos-Ortega, 2015)
we were able to design a statistical experiment that allowed us to determine if learning activities were
correlated with the grade obtained in a final cumulative exam. We concluded that if a course was
correctly designed, students that did their learning activities achieved higher score on the final grade.
Nevertheless, the side effect of such study is that it may show that final exams are unnecessary. That is
to say that if school work could be correlated to the score on the cumulative final exam, then we could
eliminate the final exam altogether. Could this be so?

The Impact of Learning Activities on the Final Grade

R. Ramirez-Velarde et al.

For example, the study (Maltese, Tai, & Fan, 2012) shows very weak correlation between homework
and final exam scores at K-12 level, even in science and mathematics. Clearly this shows that under
correctly designed exams, some learning activities could be eliminated. On the other hand, there is the
issue of eliminating the cumulative exams, not the learning activities. For example, recently Harvard
University announced that cumulative final exams were no longer mandatory (Harvard, 2010), and in
(Wiggins G. , 2014) it is argued, that under certain circumstances, for example when final exams favour
content mastery more than understanding, final exams should be eliminated.
To continue the discussion, let us define learning and let us establish guidelines for learning activities
and cumulative final exams. We do that in section 2. In section 3, we revisit previous results and discuss
them. In section 4 we present new statistical analysis and we argue in favour of the need for final exams
and in section 5 we draw our conclusions.

2 Definition of Learning and Final Exams Grades
In (Wiggins G. , 2014), it is argued that sometimes, course design is expressed as a dichotomy
between content mastery and understanding. Therefore, some evaluation instruments such exams, would
be oriented to either. If the course orientation is content mastery, then final exams can of course be
eliminated, as it is argued that content mastery is only a tool of understanding. In (Wiggins G. , 2014)
(Wiggins G. P., 1998), is stated that students that:
possess content mastery are capable of
- Recall concepts
- Repeat practiced activities
- Perform as practiced/be competent
- Plug in practiced knowledge
- Recognize/identify what they have
learned

have achieved understanding are capable of
- Justify a claim
- Connect discrete facts on their own
- Apply their learning in new contexts
- Adapt to new circumstances
- Criticize arguments made by others
- Explain how and why

And of course learning evaluation instruments would be designed following those aimed abilities. It
could be entirely the case that if we can eliminate final exams from mastery oriented courses is because
poor course design, not because final exams per se are unnecessary.

2.1 Definition of Learning
In our definition of learning, perception and memorization are only a part of the whole, and not even
the first part. We define learning as a progression of increasing knowledge complexity that follows the
path: Conceptual and Contextual Knowledge->Procedural and Problem Solving Knowledge->Cognitive
complexity knowledge. Table 1 shows the conceptual levels, and Fig. 1 shows the learning cycle
(Alexandrov & Ramirez-Velarde, 2013).
Notice that in our definition, learning is a cycle, and therefore, it has no beginning. In traditional
learning, perception (concrete experience) and memorization (construction) would be first. But as a
cycle, learning can start with action, like in interactive museums, with construction, as in the Socratic
Models or even with abstraction by stablishing hypothesis first using creativity such as in (RamirezVelarde, Perez-Cazares, Alexandrov, & Garcia-Rueda, 2014).

1813

The Impact of Learning Activities on the Final Grade

R. Ramirez-Velarde et al.

Specifically, the transition from construction to abstraction requires transformations of knowledge
that must take place in order to achieve deep understanding and competence. This should be considered
the core of the learning process (Alexandrov & Ramirez-Velarde, 2013):
1) From past to future. Information given to students is by nature the past. Students must be able to
make plans and create strategies: that is to project past learning into the future. This is effectively
achieved when we transition from reflective observation to abstract hypothesis. Observations are in
the past, therefore we reflect about those observations. Plans and hypothesis intend to predict the
future.
2) From inside to outside. Human beings receive knowledge through their senses. It must then be
effectively stored. After such process, new knowledge is created, transforming students from
knowledge receivers to knowledge producers. Again, this is achieved in the transition from
reflective observation to abstract hypothesis. We store inside our minds, in our memory, knowledge
that we took from the outside. When we make plans or create hypothesis, we project what we know
and create new knowledge about the real world, the world outside our mind. This the transformation
of knowledge that gives the strategy its name.
3) From learning to teaching. This is a power transformation in which initially students are
dependent on outside authority to inform them. Eventually, students take control of their learning
taking decisions of how, where and why. Teachers become tutors and even mentors, through a
carefully constructed scaffolding lattice of slowly retracting learning support, until student become
experts on the knowledge area.

2.2 Evaluating Learning
According to Kirkpatrick there are four levels in an evaluation system (Kirkpatrick, 1996):
1
2
3
4

Reaction of learner. What they thought and felt about the education and training
Learning. The resulting increase in knowledge or ability
Behaviour. Implementation of increased capability in a particular activity. Also called Transfer
Results. The effects on the business or environment resulting from the learner’s performance

In (Alexandrov & Ramirez-Velarde, 2013) we call level 2 cognition and levels 1 and 3
metacognition. Level 4 is related to competencies. Each of the levels should be measured for full
meaningful evaluation. In this article we will concentrate on levels 2 and 3, that is, cognition and
metacognition.
How should evaluation of knowledge and behaviours be carried out? Evaluation is such an important
aspect of our learning systems that we should try to design it with the least amount of bias and error.
Svinicki suggests that we should try to achieve the 4 R’s (Svinicki, 1999) (Pointek, 2008)

Relevant. Or Validity. Providing useful information about the concepts they were designed to
test. Any activity used to evaluate a student’s learning must be an accurate reflection of the skill
or concept which is being tested
Reliable. Allowing consistent measurement and discriminating between different levels of
performance. That means that sufficient information about required performance should be
given, instructions should be clearly communicated and the evaluation criteria should be static.
It means that students will equal skill will get equal grade.
Recognizable. Instruction has prepared students for the assessment. Students should be aware
of how they will be evaluated and their class activities should prepared them for those
evaluations.
Realistic. Concerning time and effort required to complete the assignment. That is to say, that
the amount of information obtained is balanced by the amount of work required.

So, how should learning evaluation be carried out? As pointed by Pointek (Pointek, 2008) there are
many instruments for evaluation. Nevertheless, two characteristics stand out:
-

-

Valid, reliable and recognisable evaluations should include the verbs: explore, review, classify,
associate, analyse, recall, reflect, synthesize, hypothesize, discuss, debate, practice, solve,
create, etc.
As pointed by (Myers & Myers, 2006), evaluation, specially written cumulative exams, should
be continuous and as frequent as possible, since this improves performance, improves student
satisfaction and reduces anxiety. Students that are evaluated frequently obtain better scores in
cumulative written finale exams than students that are evaluated only twice in a school period.

In this paper, we will concentrate on cumulative written final exams. Our aim is to determine the
validity, reliability and recognisability, of those in university level education. In order to determine
validity, we will carry out a statistical analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA) similar to
the one carried out in (Ramirez-Velarde, Sanhueza-Olave, Alexandrov, & De Marcos-Ortega, 2015) to
see if the work carried out by students to prepare for the evaluation allows them to get satisfactory

1815

grades. If students carry out activities but that is not reflected in a satisfactory score on an exam, then
course activities are not relevant or the exam is not relevant. We will also evaluate if school work factor
does discriminate between students that carry out those activities and those who don’t in the score of
the final exam. Also, if students activities do prepare them for their evaluation, then the evaluation is
recognizable, as students understand how they will be evaluated.

3 Multifactor Analysis of School Work and Scores on Final
Grades
In (Ramirez-Velarde, Sanhueza-Olave, Alexandrov, & De Marcos-Ortega, 2015), we analyzed
several courses by carrying out a principal component analysis (PCA) trying to establish if learning
activities were correlated with the score of a final cumulative written exam. We found that the square
cosines measure associated the first principal component (PC1) with most of the learning activities, as
shown in table 1 for the undergraduate course Stochastic Models taught from January to May 2015. This
means that there is only one path to getting a good score on the final test. If activities are associated to
a different principal component, then it could mean that a student can follow different paths to a good
grade. For example, a student can have low scores in some activities associated to certain principal
component but if she carries out a set associated to another principal component, she might still achieve
a good score on the final exam.
In figure 2 we see a positive relation between the first PC and the final exam score with a linear fit
with R statistic of 0.634, meaning that the linear fit represents 61% of the data. We concluded that if a
course is correctly designed and evaluated, then there must be only one path to a high score on the final
exam and that path is to carry out all learning activities. Nevertheless, there are some activities that are
so important in the course that can be separated by their own PC. This is again illustrated with the
Stochastic Models course in figures 3 and 4. In this course, Homework about M/M/1 queues and, about
probability and random variables are actually considered by students the main learning activities of the
course. The attention and effort given by students to these activities separates them into the second and
third PC. Nevertheless, although there is correlation between the mark obtained in these activities and
the final exam, the relationship is weak. The explanation of this requires further study.

Third Principal Componet Score…

Another important aspect to consider is, that if the first PC is associated with the most learning
activities and has a positive correlation to the final exam score, then the first PC must be a discriminant
to good and bad grades. That is, a low score on the first PC must mean a low score on the final grade.
This is illustrated in case of the Stochastic Models course in figure 5. In this figure, a label “A” means
a grade above or equal to 70% and a label “B” means a grade below 70%. There are 9 students right
from the origin and of those, only 2 have “B” label, giving a 77.77% probability of getting a good score
on the final grade if there is a good score on the first PC, and there are 9 students left from the origin of
which 6 have “B” label, giving a probability of 66.67% of having a bad score on the final test if the
score on the first PC is low. Also notice that in the upper right quadrant, the quadrant with high score in
the first two PCs, all 3 students have label “A”, giving 100% probability of having a good final score if
the score on both first PCs is high, whereas in the lower left quadrant, the quadrant with low scores on
the first two PCs all 3 students have “B” label, giving a 100% probability of low score on the final grade
if the score on the first two PCs is low.
It seems that the first PC is deterministic of the score on the final grade which raises an interesting
point. Given this information, does this mean that we can finally eliminate final exams from university
curricula? Although this seems likely, the main problem is that the variability presented in the
correlation between the first PC. Recall that the R correlation is 0.634, meaning a significant correlation,
but with high variance. Since the sample was rather small, we carried out the same statistical analysis
with much larger sample, presented in the next section.

4 Analysis of all Grades for Stochastic Models Course
For this new experiment, we gather all the known records of students for the Stochastic Models
course, from 2008 to 2015, both spring and autumn periods. We intended to reduce the variability of the
association between the first PC and the score on the final exam. It is well known that the variability of
a sample mean in relation to the population mean changes with sample size. The average of a series of
samples tends to the population mean, as the number of samples increases (Leon-Garcia, 2008). That is:

and V is the standard deviation of the population. Sample variance from the population mean
decreases as sample size n grows to infinity.
In our case, 237 records were obtained. The significance of the sample size was estimated. This is
easily done for normally distributed data. First, a normality test is carried out. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(Yamane, 1967) test indicated normality on the data. See figure 6.
After determining that the data was approximately normally distributed, we can obtain the
significance of the sample size by using table 3 (Yamane, 1967). Thus, 237 records, represent with 5%
margin of error a population between 500 and 1,000 individuals, for example.
Now we proceeded to find if the variance of the relationship between the first PC and final grade
score would diminish.

Table 3. Population, level of significance and sample sizes.
As the course changes activities in order to update and to adapt to the School calendar events and to
correct errors or bias, the number of activities had to be reduced, as some activities are dropped with
time and new ones are included. Not all the generations had the same activities. Also, some activities
changed significantly during the course of 7 years. The activity count was reduced to only six. Two
partial exams, and 4 home activities: Probability and random variables, two about queuing theory and
one about Markov processes. The resulting square cosines are shown in table 4.

This time, exams were associated to their own PC, queuing theory activities also have their own PC,
and just as in the Jan-May 2015 course, probability and random variables as well as Markov processes
activities are on their own PC. That is not the expected result.
Nevertheless, the question still stands: Do these PCs have a positive correlation with the score of the
final exam? That question is answered using figures 7, 8 and 9 (fourth PC, probability homework not
shown).

The answer is yes, there is correlation between each one of the first four PCs exists. And this
correlation is stronger with PC1, as shown in figure 6, and less strong with PCs two and three (and fourth
not shown), as seen in figures 8 and 9.
Unfortunately, the R statistic of only 10% for the first PC indicates that the variability actually
increased, not diminished. This is a reflection of the changes in the importance students give to the
learning activities and of the fact that not all learning activities are included, and in some periods other
learning activities not included in the analysis may hold higher importance to the student. As the linear
fit represents only a small percentage of the data and such fit presents too high variability, we must
conclude that final exams cannot be eliminated on the grounds that school activities drive students to
better performance on cumulative final exams.

5 Conclusions
In order to determine the effect that carrying out learning activities in engineering education on the
score on the final cumulative exam, we must first assess if the evaluation system is valid, reliable,
recognisable and realistic, indicating that students understand what is to be evaluated, how is going to
be evaluated and that students are actually evaluated in what they have learned. If the evaluation system
complies with those characteristics then the question of having or not having final cumulative exams
can be addressed.

The Impact of Learning Activities on the Final Grade

R. Ramirez-Velarde et al.

We have shown that in a correctly designed and evaluated course, using PCA of all learning
activities, the first PC will be equivalent to student’s global work. Also, that the most desirable result is
for the first PC to be associated to all, or most learning activities. Nevertheless, the nature of the activities
and the attention and importance students give to some of them will make them stand associated to their
own principal component, but keeping a positive correlation with final exam score.
Nevertheless, this correlation weakens as the sample size grows, indicating changes in the activities
themselves and the importance students attribute to them. Also, as some activities are not included in
the analysis because they are not common to all analysed periods, a lot of the explained variability can
be hidden in such not included or accounted for activities as students may have given significant
importance to them.
We therefore concluded, that with current evidence, and taking into consideration only cognitive
factors, the elimination of cumulative written final exams cannot be recommended.
