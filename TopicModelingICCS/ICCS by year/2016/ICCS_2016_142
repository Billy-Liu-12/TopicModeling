Abstract
Reduced-order model by proper orthogonal decomposition of Navier-Stokes equation can be
established in different manners. After careful screening under different sampling intervals and
different numbers of basis vectors, it has been found that the model can achieve high precision only
when it is constructed on collocated grid with the samples still on the staggered grid. The model
straightforwardly established on the staggered grid may lose accuracy apparently. To precisely capture
the dynamic behavior of flow field, the sampling interval should be small enough while the number of
basis vectors should be moderate. These conclusions can be a valuable principle for future modeling of
the dynamics of fluid flow.

1 Introduction
Numerical solution of Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation is important for prediction or control of fluid
flow in engineering. The computational time is usually very long for large grid numbers encountered
in complex systems (Prithiviraj and Andrews, 1998) or turbulent flows (Yu and Kawaguchi, 2004;

Staggered/Collocated POD-ROM for Unsteady Navier-Stokes Flow

Yi Wang and Tingyu Li

Wang et al, 2009). Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method can speed up the computation
efficiently via establishing reduced-order model (ROM) by Galerkin projection (Sirovich, 1987). Thus,
POD-ROM of N-S equation is obtaining more and more studies (Wang, 2007; Du, 2011; Xiao, 2013).
However, the construction manners of the POD-ROM, such as modeling on staggered grid or
collocated grid, have not been concerned. This may confuse the modeling direction or affect the model
precision. To clarify a unique POD-ROM with high precision, we discuss these two ways in this paper
using the classical example of two-dimensional (2D) laminar lid-driven cavity flow. The straightforward modeling on staggered grid is examined at first in Section 2 followed by the collocated
modeling in Section 3.

Eqs.(1)~(3) can be directly solved by the classical maker-and-cell (MAC) algorithm (shown in
Fig.1) to obtain the dynamic behavior of the flow. For simplicity, we use uniform mesh here. To apply
POD, a sample matrix storing velocity fields at different moments is constructed first and then the

Eq.(12) is the reduced-order model established directly on the staggered grid. The reconstructed
velocity (take U as an example) computed by the POD model are compared with the velocity obtained
through the MAC algorithm (sampling velocity) to examine the precision of reconstruction. The
precision fluctuates with different sampling intervals and different numbers of basis vectors. Thus, we
take the comparison in different values of these two factors to obtain non-bias results. The fluid in the
initial condition is static. Uniform 64×64 mesh is applied. Re=1000, ǻĲ=10-3 and 105 time steps are
used so that the total dimensionless time scale is 100. The comparison results of U in five grid points
(i.e. (2,2), (4,4), (8,8), (16,16), (32,32)) are shown in Fig.2~Fig.5. The straight lines and the circles

Fig.5 Reconstruction results in the sampling interval 125ǻĲ
The results show that the deviation between the reconstructed velocity and the sampling velocity
decreases at first and then increases again with increasing number of the basis vectors, at any sampling
interval. However, the reconstructed velocity always appears undershoot or overshoot around the
sampling velocity. No such an ideal situation can be found that the velocity in any of these five

positions is close enough to the sampling velocity. Thus, the straight-forward way to establish PODROM of Navier-Stokes equation on staggered grid fails to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of fluid
flow precisely.

3 Collocated POD-ROM
We attempted another way to establish the POD-ROM for improving the precision. In this way,
the sampling velocity components on cell surfaces (arrows in Fig.1) are linearly interpolated to cell
centers (dots in Fig.1) before the POD process. Also via the similar process from Eq.(6) to Eq.(11),
another POD-ROM very similar to Eq.(12) is established. For conciseness, we do not change the form
of Eq.(12) but change the meaning of the symbols as follows:

Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) compose a new reduced-order model of the N-S equation. Please note that the
symbols U and V here represent the velocity components and their basis vectors on cell centers.
Therefore, this model can be named “collocated POD-ROM”. Its reconstruction results are shown in
Fig.6~Fig.9. They are similar to the results of the straight-forward POD-ROM (Fig.5~Fig.8), but we
can find an ideal case that the reconstructed velocity in the five positions always agree very well with

Fig.9 Reconstruction results in the sampling interval 125ǻĲ
Results in above figures are only velocity component U in five local points. To confirm the
precision of the collocated POD-ROM, we compare the global errors of U and V with sampling
velocity in Fig.10. It can be seen that the errors of the reconstructed velocity of the collocated PODROM are very small, i.e. less than 0.7% over the characteristic velocity Utop=1, which are quite
smaller than those of the straight-forward POD-ROM (up to 2.5%). Flow fields at three typical
moments, as labeled by the circles, are compared in Fig.11. The reconstructed flow fields all coincide
with sampling flow fields. These results confirm that the collocated POD-ROM can reconstruct the
flow field precisely in the whole dynamic process so that it can overcome the inaccuracy of the
staggered POD-ROM.

4 Conclusions and suggestions
Reconstruction manners of Navier-Stokes equation describing unsteady fluid flow have been
studied. Staggered or collocated grid, sampling interval and number of basis vectors are discussed to
search a POD-ROM which has the ability to reconstruct dynamic flow field with high precision.
Conclusions in principle are made as follows:
(1) Although Navier-Stokes equation is usually solved on staggered grid to ensure stable coupling
of velocity and pressure, the POD-ROM of the N-S equation should be established only on the
collocated grid which has the sole effect to achieve high precision of reconstruction.
(2) Even on the collocated grid, the POD-ROM can only obtain high precision of dynamic flow
field under the small-enough sampling interval and the moderate number of basis vectors. Larger
sampling interval or too many/few basis vectors may cause the model lose accuracy.
Although the conclusions are obtained in the condition of 2D laminar flow, the principle is also
suitable for more complex flows because a model that is inaccurate for the simple cases cannot be
expected to be accurate for complex cases.
