Abstract
This paper describes a change of variables applied to Richards’ equation for steady-state unsaturated
seepage flow that makes the numerical representation of the new version of this highly nonlinear
partial differential equation (PDE) much easier to solve, and the solution is significantly more
accurate. The method is applied to two-dimensional unsaturated steady-state flow in a block of soil
that is initially very dry until water is applied at the top. Both a quasi-linear version of relative
hydraulic conductivity for which an analytic solution exists and a van Genuchten version of relative
hydraulic conductivity are numerically solved using the original and new versions of the governing
PDE. Finally, results of this research will be presented in this paper. It was found that for the test
problem, the change-of-variables version of the governing PDE was significantly easier to solve and
resulted in more accurate solutions than the original version of the PDE.
Keywords: Richards’ equation, analytic methods, numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations

1 Introduction
Richards’ equation (Richards, 1931) is a highly nonlinear equation that governs unsaturated
seepage flow in soils. Various linearization schemes such as Newton and Picard methods (Putti and
Paniconi, 1992 and Mehl, 2006), often used in conjunction with line search techniques (Tracy, 2009),
have been applied to the numerical representation of this nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE)
to iterate to a solution with varying degrees of success. Often, a comprehensive solution remains
elusive. This challenge is especially difficult for steady-state problems. For transient solutions, the size
of the time step can be easily decreased, thus giving the numerical solution more stability. There is no
time step size in the steady-state solution. Some researchers have used a pseudo-transient approach
(Tracy, et al., 2005) in which the time step is gradually increased to the point where a steady-state
solution results. From the author’s experience, this proved to be a delicate hit-and-miss solution for the
most difficult problems.

Using Analytic Solution Methods on Unsaturated Seepage Flow Computations

Fred Tracy

This research uses analytic methods that allow more accurate numerical solutions of the steadystate version of Richards' equation to be obtained using fewer nonlinear iterations. Analytic methods
have been applied to groundwater modeling (Tracy, 2006 and 2007) in which either analytic solutions
exist or techniques such as analytic element methods (Haitjema, 2005) are applied. A change of
variables is used in the steady-state version of Richards’ equation to improve accuracy and
convergence of the numerical solution. Details will now be presented.

2 Governing Equations
2.1 Richards’ Equation
Richards’ equation for unsaturated steady-state seepage flow in a homogeneous, isotropic medium
is given by

where
݄ = pressure head (L)
݇௥ = relative hydraulic conductivity (0 ൑ ݇௥ ൑ 1)
‫ = ݔ‬x coordinate (L)
‫ = ݕ‬y coordinate (L)
Eq. 1 is highly nonlinear because ݇௥ is a function of ݄.

2.2 Relative Hydraulic Conductivity
There are many ways to compute relative hydraulic conductivity. These are typically rooted in data
obtained from laboratory experiments or analyses of field data. Two methods will be discussed in this
paper: the van Genuchten approximation (van Genuchten, 1980) and quasi-linear approximation
(Warrick, 2003).
For ݄ < 0, the van Genuchten approximation is given by
݇௥ =

{1 െ (െߚ݄)௡ିଵ [1 + (െߚ݄)௡ ]ି௠ }ଶ
[1 + (െߚ݄)௡ ]௠/ଶ

where
݊ = modeling parameter that varies with soil type (݊ > 0)
݉ = 1െ

ଵ
௡

ߚ = modeling parameter that varies with soil type (Lିଵ ) (ߚ > 0)

For ݄ < 0 , the quasi-linear form (Warrick, 2003) used in this paper comes from Gardner’s
equation (Gardner, 1958) and is
ln ݇௥ = ߙ݄

(3)

where
ߙ = input parameter (ߙ > 0)
In all cases, ݇௥ = 1 when ݄ ൒ 0.

3 Change of Variables
To alleviate the sharp nonlinearity, the following change of variables was done:
ߦ = ݁ ఈ௛೎ ൬2 െ

݄
൰ െ 1, ݄ ൑ ݄௖
݄௖

(4)

ߦ = ݁ ఈ௛ െ 1, ݄௖ ൑ ݄ ൑ 0

(5)

ߦ = ݄, ݄ ൒ 0

(6)

where
݄௖ = a cut-off value of pressure head (L) where the variation of ߦ with respect to ݄ switches at
݄ = ݄௖ from exponential to linear variation
This switching is required because of round-off error if only the exponential form is used. ݄௖ = -40 ft
worked well for the test problem given below. Also, when ݄ ൒ 0, the van Genuchten equations no
longer apply as flow switches to saturated flow, thus requiring the third equation, ߦ = ݄. The above
equations for ߦ were constructed such that ߦ is continuous over the entire range of ݄.
Accompanying these equations are modified versions of relative hydraulic conductivity, and they
are
ߢ௥ = ݁ ିఈ௛೎ ݇௥ , ݄ ൑ ݄௖

(7)

ߢ௥ = ݁ ିఈ௛ ݇௥ , ݄௖ ൑ ݄ ൑ 0

(8)

ߢ௥ = 1, ݄ ൒ 0

(9)

Again, ߢ௥ is continuous over the entire range of ݄. The final version of the new PDE will now be
presented. This is accomplished by substituting Eqs. 4-9 into Eq. 1.

3.1 ݄ ൑ ݄௖ , ߦ ൑ ݁ ఈ௛೎ െ 1
First, Eqs. 4 and 7 are used to produce

4 Test Problem
A 2-D test problem (Tracy, 2011) for which an analytic solution exists (Tracy, 2006 and 2007) was
selected to examine the quality of the change of variables version of the PDE as compared to the
original PDE. The problem consists of 2-D steady-state flow in an ܽ × ‫ ܮ‬cross section of
homogeneous, isotropic soil where ܽ = 50 ft and ‫ = ܮ‬50 ft. The soil is initially dry until water is
applied at the top (see Fig. 1). Both the quasi-linear (Eq. 2) and van Genuchten (Eq. 3) expressions for
relative hydraulic conductivity are used with values of the input parameters being ߚ = 0.122 ft ିଵ ,
݊ = 2.24, and ߙ = 0.27 ft ିଵ . The bottom and sides have the boundary condition of ݄ = ݄௥ = െ50 ft.
To make the analytic solution very simple when Eq. 2 is used, the top boundary condition is
݄(‫ݔ‬, ‫= )ܮ‬

5 Computational Algorithm
A 200 × 200 equally spaced mesh with grid size ȟ୶୷ was imposed on the 50 ft × 50 ft flow region
in which a finite difference approach (Strikwerda, 2004) resulting in a 5-point stencil was used. This
resulted in a nonlinear set of equations that were solved using a Picard linearization in which varying
amounts of the change in pressure head from one nonlinear iteration to the next were accepted. The
linear system of equations resulting from each nonlinear iteration was solved by a relaxation type
scheme. To illustrate, the finite difference approximation to Eq. 1 at grid point (݅, ݆) at nonlinear
iteration, ݊ + 1, that was used is

In the program used in this research, ߱ was adjusted dynamically depending on how well the
nonlinear system of equations was converging.
The nonlinear convergence criterion was 1.0 × 10ିହ , and the linear solver convergence criterion
was 1.0 × 10ି଼ . The cut-off pressure head ݄௖ used in Eqs. 4 and 7 was set to -40 ft.

7 Analysis
The success of the COV can be better understood by observing the differences between ݇௥ (Fig. 2)
and ߢ௥ (Fig. 3) for relative hydraulic conductivity and ݄ (Fig. 4) and ߦ (Fig. 5) for the solution for V.
The ݇௥ curve has a significant shift from near horizontal to near vertical as pressure head approaches
zero. Also, ݄ shifts abruptly from near horizontal to near vertical as ‫ ݕ‬decreases. Thus rapid change is
made less severe after the COV for both ݇௥ and ߦ, making the numerics easier to converge and more
accurate.
The following observations can be drawn from the numerical results:

The difference between the analytic solution and the numerical solution for the quasi-linear
version of relative hydraulic conductivity before COV was remarkable. For some of the test
points in the mesh, the incorrect sign of the result was exhibited.
After COV, the quasi-linear version converged in one nonlinear iteration and was very
accurate.
Large differences also occurred for the van Genuchten option for relative hydraulic
conductivity when comparing results before and after COV.
The number of nonlinear iterations was significantly reduced when using the COV version of
the PDE.
The errors were greater at some grid locations than for others.
The ݇௥ curves in Fig. 2 are relatively close so the results for Q and V after COV are also
reasonably close.

8 Conclusions
The change of variables technique described in this paper showed a significant improvement in
both accuracy and number of nonlinear iterations for solving the steady-state version of Richards’
equation for the test problem of unsaturated flow in a 2-D cross section of soil. This technique could
be extended to three-dimensional problems and other numerical techniques such as the finite element
method.
