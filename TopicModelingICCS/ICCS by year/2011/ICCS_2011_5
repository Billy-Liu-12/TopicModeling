Abstract
By exemplifying the cases of China’s twenty financial cities, this paper tries to identify the linkages between property prices and
bank lending in China’s regional financial centers and finds that long-run causality appears between property prices and bank
lending for each financial center. Time series techniques and dynamic panel data model are used in this paper. Through analysis,
this paper gives the conclusion that bank lending plays an important role in pushing up property prices. Property price indeed
follows a dynamic process and the property prices of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen change in a more stable way. In detail,
people of the three financial centers in China Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen pay more attention to bank lending when buying
their houses.

Keywords: Financial centres; Property prices; Bank lending; Dynamic panel data model

1. Introduction
There is coincidence of cycles in credit and property markets. However, what is the direction of causality
between bank lending and property prices? From a theoretical point of view, causality may go in both directions.
Bank lending may affect property prices via various liquidity effects. Property can be seen as a durable good in
temporarily fixed supply. An increase in the availability of credit may increase the demand for housing if
households are borrowing constrained. With supply temporarily fixed because of the time it takes to construct new
housing units, this increase in demand will be reflected in higher property prices. The price of property can also be
seen as an asset price, which is determined by the discounted future stream of property returns. An increase in the
availability of credit may lower interest rates and stimulate current and future expected economic activity. As a
result, property prices may rise because of higher expected returns on property and a lower discount factor.
On the other hand, property prices may affect bank lending via various wealth effects. Bernanke and Gertler

(1989)[1], Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)[2] and Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1998)[3] think that due to financial
market imperfections, households and firms may be borrowing constrained. As a result, households and firms can
only borrow when they offer collateral, so that their borrowing capacity is a function of their collateralisable net
worth. Since property is commonly used as collateral, property prices are therefore an important determinant of the
private sector’s borrowing capacity. Second, property prices affect the value of bank capital, both directly to the
extent that banks own assets and indirectly by affecting the value of loans secured by property. Property prices
therefore influence the risk taking capacity of banks and thus their willingness to extend loans. Finally, a change in
property prices may have a significant effect on consumer’s perceived lifetime wealth, inducing them to change
their spending and borrowing plans and thus their credit demand in order to smooth consumption over the life cycle.
Kindleberger (1978)[4] and Minsky (1982)[5] think that this potential two-way causality between bank lending and
property prices may give rise to mutually reinforcing cycles in credit and property markets. A rise in property prices,
caused by more optimistic expectations about future economic prospects, raises the borrowing capacity of firms and
households by increasing the value of collateral. Part of the additional available credit may also be used to purchase
property, pushing up property prices even further, so that a self-reinforcing process may evolve.
A lot of empirical research has been done on the relationship between credit and asset prices. Most studies rely
on a single equation setup, focusing either on bank lending or property prices. Using annual data, Borio, Kennedy
and Prowse (1994)[6] investigate the relationship between credit to GDP ratios and aggregate asset prices for a large
sample of industrialized countries over the period 1970-1992. Hypothesizing that the development of credit
conditions as measured by the credit to GDP ratio can help to explain the evolution of aggregate asset prices, they
focus on the determinants of aggregate asset price fluctuations. They find that adding the credit to GDP ratio to an
asset pricing equation helps to improve the fit of this equation in most countries. They demonstrate that the boombust cycle in asset markets of the late 1980s-ealy 1990s would have been much less pronounced or would not have
occurred at all had credit ratios remained constant based on simulations. Goodhart (1995)[7] finds that property
prices significantly affect credit growth in the UK but not in the US.
Lamont and Stein (1999)[8] use city-level data to analyze the relationship between homeowner borrowing patterns
and house-price dynamics. Their finding is that in cities where a greater fraction of homeowners are highly
leveraged-i.e., have high loan-to-value ratios-house prices react more sensitively to city-specific shocks, such as
changes in per-capita income. This finding emphasizes the role of borrowing in shaping the behavior of asset prices.
Greef and Hass (2000)[9] estimate models for both the Dutch housing and the mortgage market. According to their
model, housing prices were influenced by changes in bank lending criteria during the estimation period and in the
short run housing prices can deviate substantially from their long-run equilibrium value. Collyns and Senhadji
(2002)[10] find that credit growth has a significant contemporaneous effect on residential property prices for a panel
of four East Asian countries. These four countries are Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Thailand. Based on this
finding, they conclude that bank lending contributed significantly to the real estate bubble in Asia prior to the 1997
East Asian crisis.
Based on a multivariate empirical framework, Hofmann (2001)[11], Hofmann (2003)[12] and Gerlach and Peng
(2005)[13] analyze the relationship between bank lending and property prices. Hofmann (2001)[11] finds that
including property prices in the empirical model is imperative for the explanation of the long-run development of
bank lending for a set of 16 industrialized countries. He also finds that long-run causality goes from property prices
and real activity to bank lending. Based on impulse response analysis, Hofmann finds that property price
innovations have a significantly positive effect on bank lending and vice versa, suggesting a two-way relationship
between credit and property prices. The problem with this paper’s analysis is that the identified patterns of causality
are likely not to be invariant to the indentifying assumptions imposed upon the estimated VARs. Hofmann (2003)[12]
analyses the patterns of dynamic interaction between bank lending and property prices based on a sample of 20
countries using both time series and panel data techniques. Long-run causality appears to go from property prices to
bank lending. There is also evidence of short-run causality going in both directions, implying that a mutually
reinforcing element in past boom-bust cycles in credit and property markets cannot be ruled out. Gerlach and Peng
(2005)[13] overcome this problem by analyzing the direction of causality between bank lending and property prices
in Hong Kong based on standard regression techniques, controlling for potential simultaneity problems. They find
that long-run and short-run causality goes from property prices to lending, rather than conversely.
Liang and Cao (2007)[14] investigate the relationship between property prices and bank lending for the case of
China over the period 1999Q1-2006Q2. They find that there exists unidirectional causality running from bank

1662

lending to property prices, and that the causality runs interactively through the error correction term from bank
lending, GDP and interest rate to property prices. Goodhart and Hofmann (2003)[15] assess the innovations to
property prices have a significant effect on bank lending in the large majority of countries. Goodhart and Hofmann
(2007, 2008)[16,17] assess the linkages between money, credit, house prices and economic activity in industrialized
countries over the last three decades. They find that there is evidence of a significant multidirectional link between
house prices, monetary variables and the macroeconomy. Oikarinen (2009)[18,19] examines empirically if household
borrowing data is of importance in a dynamic housing price model. Housing appreciation in the Helsinki
Metropolitan area is Granger caused by the household debt-to-GDP ratio both in the short and in the long run. There
has been a significant two-way interaction between housing prices and housing loan stock in Finland since the
financial liberalization in the late 1980s. Gimeno (2010)[20] estimates a vector error-correction model and finds that
house purchase loans and house prices in Spain are interdependent in the long-run.
In the following we assess, based on time series and dynamic panel data techniques, the patterns of dynamic
interaction between bank lending and property prices for a sample of 20 China’s cities since the year of 2008. The
paper is organized as follows. The following Section 2 describes the data. In Section 3, we test and estimate longrun relationships between bank lending, economic activity and property prices. In Section 4 we use dynamic panel
data model to test for the patterns of long-run and short-run causality between bank lending and property prices for
each financial center. Section 5 concludes.
2. Data
A financial center is conventionally regarded as a place with an agglomeration of financial institutions providing
all banking and financial services, regionally, nationally or internationally. The development of financial centers can
offer a good example to illustrate the continuous significance of geography in the location choice of business. Since
there are a lot of multinational corporation branches and high-end financial services in financial center cities, some
of the financial centers are economic centers, political centers and trade centers at the same time. The property
prices of these financial center cities have different patterns and characteristics compared to the other cities. While a
financial center can be seen as the pivot of financial network, the services of the banks in that city are more
comprehensive and developed.
In the following sections we have analyzed the relationship between aggregate bank lending, consumer retail
sales as a measure of aggregate economic activity, residential property prices in China’s twenty cities. These cities
are China’s regional financial centers, including Beijing, Chengdu, Dalian, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Jinan,
Nanjing, Ningbo, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuxi, Wuhan, Xi’an, Xiamen, Zhengzhou and
Chongqing. In fact, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have been included in the rankings of the Global Financial
Center Index (GFCI) produced by the Z/Yen Group for the city of London. So we can regard these three cities as the
international financial centers. The other cities, which have not been included in the GFCI, can only be regarded as
China’s regional financial centers. We also use the monthly data of the deposit, retail sales, sales volume of real
estate and real estate investment for each city. These data were taken from the CEIC and WIND database. All data
were seasonally adjusted using the census X-12 procedure.
Monthly residential property price indices were available for all cities. Residential property prices may not fully
capture the property price developments which are relevant for aggregate bank lending. Credit aggregates comprise
bank lending to households and enterprises. The appropriate measure of property prices for the empirical analysis
would therefore be an aggregate property price index, comprising both residential and commercial property prices.
Hofmann(2003)[12] finds that residential and commercial property prices are closely correlated, suggesting that
residential property prices may act as a proxy for omitted commercial property prices in the empirical analysis. So in
the following analyses, we use monthly residential property price indices. Bank lending is defined as total credit to
the private non-bank sector.
The sample period for the following analysis is 2008:1-2010:8. This is a rather short sample period, implying that
the power of unit root and cointegration tests may be low. The results of these tests should therefore be taken with
caution and be regarded as being rather suggestive. In order to partly overcome this problem, we also exploit the
rather large cross-section dimension of the analysis to perform panel unit root and cointegration tests.
3. Unit roots and cointegration

3.1. Unit roots tests
Firstly, we perform standard augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)[21] unit root tests to test for the order of integration
of the time series under investigation. The ADF test regression is of the form:
'x

k

P  G t  J xt 1  ¦ 'xt  i  H t

(1)

i 1

Allowing for a maximum lag order of eleven, the lag order k was determined by sequential t-tests eliminating all
lags up to the first significant at the first 5% level. The test regression for the level of each variable contained a
constant and a trend, the test regression for the first difference contained only a constant. The ADF test statistic is the
t -statistic of J . If J is significantly smaller than zero, the null hypothesis of a unit root can be rejected. We also
perform a panel ADF test. The standardized average of the N individual ADF test statistics has a standard normal
distribution, which is shown in (2), where tJ is the average of the individual ADF test statistics and P and G are
respectively the mean and the variance of the distribution of the ADF test statistic. Large negative values therefore
imply a rejection of the null of a unit root.

On the whole, the results suggest that the natural logs of bank lending, property prices and retail sales for each
city are integrated of order one except that the natural logs of bank lending, property prices and retail sales for
Tianjin are integrated of order two. This conclusion is suggested by the individual city level tests. The panel tests
also suggest that the natural logs of bank lending, property prices and retail sales for each city are integrated of order
one.
3.2. Cointegration tests
Given the results of the unit root tests we test in the following for the presence of a long-run relationship between
bank lending, retail sales and property prices. Since we have more than two variables in the system and therefore
potentially more than one long-run relationship among these variables, the multivariate Johansen approach
(Johansen, 1988, 1991, 1992)[22-24], which allows us to test for the number of cointegrating relationships in the
system, is a natural starting point for cointegration analysis. The Johansen approach is based on maximum
likelihood estimation of a cointegrating VAR model, which can be formulated in a vector error correction form:
'xt

*1'xt 1  ...  * k 1'xt  k 1  3xt  i  P  H t

(3)

where x is a vector of endogenous variables comprising the log of bank lending, retail sales and property prices. P is
a vector of constants and H is a vector of white noise error terms. The rank of the matrix 3 indicates the number of
long-run relationships between the endogenous variables in the system[25]. The cointegrating rank hypothesis for the
Johansen trace test is specified as H (r ) : rank (3 ) d r against the alternative H ( p) : rank (3 ) p . The lag order of the
VECMs was determined based on sequential Likelihood-ratio tests, eliminating all lags up to the first lag significant
at the 5% level.
We also perform a panel cointegration trace test. The test statistic is the standardized average of the N individual
trace test statistics:
< LR

N ( LR  P )

G

(4)

1664

Xinwei Che et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1660–1667

where LR is the average of the individual trace statistics and P and G are respectively the mean and the variance of
the asymptotic distribution of the trace test statistic. The test is one sided with large positive values of the test
statistics suggesting a rejection of the null hypothesis of no cointegration.
The results suggest that there is a single long-run relationship between bank lending, retail sales and property
prices. The null of no cointegration is rejected at least at the 10% level in 18 out of 20 cities. Two-long-run
relationships are indicated only for Shanghai. The panel trace test rejects the null hypothesis of one long-run
relationship against the alternative of no long-run relationship, but it does not reject the null hypothesis of one longrun relationship against the alternative of more than one, therefore suggesting that there is a single long-run
relationship in the system.
4. Dynamic panel data model
We decide to estimate a panel data model to investigate the relationship of property price and bank lending. The
following model is our basic version:
HPi ,t

E 0  E1Loani ,t  E 2 Depositi ,t  E3Consumei ,t  E 4 Salei ,t  E5 Investi ,t  ui ,t

(5)

HPi ,t is the change of hours price index of city i at month t . Loani ,t is the credit loans of city i at

month t . Depositi ,t , Consumei , t , Salei ,t and Investi ,t are the deposit, volume of retail sales, volume of real estate sales and
real estate investment of city i at month t .
When studying the relationship between property price and bank lending, one important issue is that the property
price follows a dynamic process which means that the lagged property price may affect the current one. The general
model of the data-generating process is much like this:
yit

D yi ,t 1  xit' E  H it

H it

Pt  vit

E[ P t ]

E[vit ]

(6)
E[ Pi vit ] 0

Here the distributed term has two orthogonal components: the fixed effects Pi , and the idiosyncratic shocks, vit .
We can rewrite it as
'yit

(D  1) yi ,t 1  xit' E  H it

(7)

So the model can equally be thought of as being for the level or growth of y . The process is dynamic, with current
realization of the dependent variable influenced by past ones. There are some assumptions about the data-generating
process. There maybe arbitrarily distributed fixed individual effects in the dynamic, so that the dependent variable
consistently changes faster for some observational units than others. This argues against cross-section regressions,
which must essentially assume fixed effects away, and in favor of a panel set-up, where variation over time can be
used to identify parameters. And some regressors may be endogenous. The idiosyncratic disturbances (those apart
from the fixed effects) may have individual-specific patterns of heteroskedasticity and serial correlation. The
idiosyncratic disturbances are uncorrelated across individuals. In addition, some secondary worries shape the design.
Firstly, some regressors may be predetermined but not strictly exogenous: even if independent of current disturbances,
still influenced by past ones. The lagged dependent variable is an example. Secondly, the number of time periods of
available data may be small. Finally, they do not assume that good instruments are available outside the immediate
data set. In effect, it is assumed that: the only available instruments are “internal” based on lags of the instrumented
variables.
In order to reflect the impact of the lagged property price, we extend our model by put it into the ordinary panel
data model, the extended version is as follows:

1665

Xinwei Che et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1660–1667

HPi ,t

E 0  E HPi ,t 1  E1Loani ,t  E 2 Depositi ,t  E3Consumei ,t  E 4 Salei ,t  E5 Investi ,t  ui ,t

(8)

Adding the lagged property price to the panel data model may cause two problems. First, the presence of the
lagged dependent variable gives rise to autocorrelation. Second, the independent variables are assumed to be
endogenous which lead to biased and inconsistent coefficients. Because causality may run in both directions-from
loans variable Loani , t to consume variable Consumei , t and vice versa-these independent variables may correlated with
the error term.
In order to deal with both issues we estimate a dynamic specification of the extended model. Following Blundell
and Bond (1998)[26] we use the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator which, comparing with
the difference GMM estimator, use more information to estimate coefficients thus outperforms the difference GMM
estimator in most of the situations.
There are two kinds of system GMM estimator: one-step system GMM estimator and two-step system GMM
estimator. The standard errors of two-step system GMM estimator are downward biased. Though the bias can be
corrected by Windmeijer (2005)[27] adjustment, still the reliability of the estimator can not be guaranteed. Based on
these considerations, we choose the one-step GMM estimator in our empirical study (Bond, 2002)[28].
A crucial assumption for the validity of GMM estimates is of course that the instruments are exogenous. If the
estimation is exactly identified, detection of invalid instruments is impossible. But if the system is overidentified, a
test statistic for the joint validity of the moment condition falls naturally out of the GMM framework. Under the null
of joint validity, the vector of empirical moments is randomly distributed around 0. A Wald test can check this
hypothesis. The Hansen(1982)[29] J test statistic for overidentifying restrictions is just the minimized value of the
criterion expression for an efficient GMM estimator. If non-sphericity is suspected in the errors, as in robust onestep GMM, the Sargan test[30] statistic is inconsistent. In that case, a theoretical superior overidentification test for
the one-step estimator is that based on the Hansen statistic from a two-step estimate.
Sargan/Hansen statistics can also be used to test the validity of subsets of instruments, via a “difference in
Sargan” test. If one performs an estimation with and without a subset of suspect instruments, under the null of joint
validity of the full instrument test, the difference in the two reported Sargan/Hansen test statistics is itself
asymptotically F 2 , with degrees of freedom equal to the number of suspect instruments. The regression without the
suspect instruments is called the “unrestricted” regression since it imposes fewer moment conditions. The
difference-in-Sargan test is of course only feasible if this unrestricted regression is exactly or over-identified[31].

Blundell and Bond (1998)[26] show that a high persistence in the series leads to weak instruments in the GMM
estimator. In our estimation we examine the validity of our instruments using the Sargan test. The dynamic panel

1666

Xinwei Che et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1660–1667

data model estimation results are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, the t-statistics are in parentheses. All variables
(except for property price) are in logarithms and ***,**,*means significant at 1%, 5%, 10% level separately. Due to
the paper length limitation, seasonal effect is included but not shown.
Two important conclusions can be drawn from column 1 of Table 1. First, property price indeed follows a
dynamic process. The coefficient of lagged dependent variables is positive and significant which implies that the
lagged property price has an impact on the current one. Second, the Sargan test is not significant at 10% level which
means that our instruments are valid and overcome the endogeneity problem.
The coefficient of lagged dependent variable in column 3 is 0.501 which is smaller than 0.575 in column 2.
Comparing with the three international financial centers (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen), the other city’s inertia of
property price is relatively small which indicates that the property prices of the three international financial centers
change in a more stable way.
We find that bank lending plays an important role in pushing up property price because the coefficients of credit
loans are positive and significant in all three columns. The coefficient of loans of column 2 is 2.450, much bigger
than that of column 3, which means that people of the three international financial centers pay more attention to
credit loans when buying their houses. We think there are two explanations for this: first, people in financial centers
gain access to credit loans more easily than people in other cities; second, the property prices of financial centers are
high which drives the people use credit loans as their first choice when buying a house.
5. Conclusions
From a theoretical point of view, the relationship between bank lending and property prices is multifaceted.
Property prices may affect credit via various wealth effects, while credit may affect property prices via various
liquidity effects. This paper analyses the patterns of dynamic interaction between bank lending and property prices
based on a sample of twenty China’s regional financial center cities using both time series and dynamic panel data
techniques. Long-run causality appears to go from property prices to bank lending. Bank lending plays an important
role in pushing up property price and people of the three international financial centers pay more attention to credit
loans when buying their houses. We also find that the property prices of the three financial centers change in a more
stable way.
