Abstract
We propose a new scheme to construct an orbital-specific (OS) hybrid functional so as to satisfy the linearity condition that the
second derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation number in Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) is
zero. Numerical assessment confirms that the orbital energies exhibit a significantly small fractional-occupation-number
dependence for NH3 molecule. The newly proposed OS hybrid functional accurately reproduces ionization potentials (IPs) of
core and valence orbitals for molecules containing second and third row atoms in the sense of Koopmans’ theorem.

1. Introduction
Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) [1-4] has been widely used since accurate exchange-correlation
(XC) functionals have been developed extensively. In particular, global hybrid functionals such as Becke-3parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) [3, 5-9] and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)-1-parameter-PBE (PBE1PBE) [10,
11] have been adopted to investigate chemical and physical phenomena. The appearance of the global hybrids
makes DFT a powerful alternative tool to compute electronic states in quantum chemistry and solid state physics.
The balance between the computational cost and relatively accurate description is a major reason for the wide
application although the global hybrids exhibit shortcomings in describing weak interactions and long-range related
phenomena.
More advanced hybrid functionals such as range-separated [12-18], local [19], and orbital-specific (OS) [18, 2023] hybrid functionals in KS-DFT have been developed to solve the shortcomings. Our group has developed the OS
hybrid functional that owns Hartree-Fock exchange (HFx) portions depending on orbital natures: core-valenceRydberg (CVR)-B3LYP hybrid functional [20-22]. The OS parameters in CVR-B3LYP were determined by

numerical assessment, i.e., by assessing core, valence, and Rydberg excitation energies. However, no clear reason
for the choice of the OS parameters was clarified. Thus, we have attempted to determine the OS parameters by a
physical condition [23] and report the results of the recently developed OS hybrid functional.
2. Theory
We explain how to constructs an OS hybrid functional by imposing the linearity condition that the second
derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation number is zero, as reported in Ref. [23]. First, we
explain the linearity condition and explain how to construct the OS hybrid functional.
2.1 Linearity condition
Since Janak’s theorem [24] holds for KS-DFT, the first derivative of the total energy with respect to the
occupation number fi of the ith KS orbital is equivalent to its orbital energy:
wE

Almbladh and von Barth have proved that the HOMO energy is proven to be equivalent to the first ionization
potential (IP) with the opposite sign [25]. Thus, the following relation is obtained:

IP.

Since the HOMO IP should be constant, the following linearity condition is naturally derived:

0d f i d1

which can be rewritten as:
w2E
wf i 2

0d f i d1

0.

(4)

0d f i d1

Note that Eq. (4) should not necessarily be satisfied except for the HOMO but is considered to improve the
descriptions of self-interaction error (SIE) related phenomena [23].
Eq. (4) has been examined for a wide variety of hybrid functionals in terms of fractionally occupied number
(FON) states, which has been originally discussed by Perdew et al [26]. Total energies and orbital energies of FON
states were illustrated for various functionals and can be thought to be a criterion to judge the quality of DFT XC
functional [16, 17, 27].
2.2 Construction of OS hybrid functional
Next, we describe how to construct the OS hybrid functional using Eq. (4). When the XC functional has the
following form:
E XC [D ] (1  D ) E XDFT  DE XHF  ECDFT ,

(5)

where D is a parameter for HFx and EXDFT , E XDFT and ECDFT are the DFT exchange (DFTx), HFx, and DFT
correlation (DFTc) energies, respectively. The corresponding orbital energy H XC [D ] is expressed:

H i [D ] H T  H Ne  H J  1  D H XDFT  DH XHF  H CDFT

1  D ^H T  H Ne  H J  H XDFT  H CDFT ` D ^H T  H Ne  H J  H XHF  H CDFT `,

(6)

1153

Yutaka Imamura et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1151–1156

where H T , H Ne , H J , H XDFT , H XHF , and H CDFT are the kinetic, nuclear attraction, Coulomb, DFTx, HFx, and DFTc
contributions for the orbital energy, respectively. Here, we introduce the following assumption:

H i [D ] # 1  D H iDFT  DH iHF DFTc ,

(7)

DFT
HF DFTc
where H i and H i
are the pure DFT and HF+DFTc orbital energies, respectively. We determine OS D for
each orbital, i.e., D i for the ith KS orbital:

wH i [D i ]
wH DFT
# 1  D i  i
wf i 0d f d1
wf i

 Di
0d f i d1

wH iHF DFTc

(8)

0.
0d f i d1

Once D i is determined, we estimate orbital energies by the following relation:

H i [D i ] # 1  D i H iDFT  D i H iHF DFTc .

(9)

Although an arbitrary hybrid XC functional containing one parameter D i can be selected, the LC-BLYP hybrid
LC-BLYP
wf i and wH iHFLYP wf i , which are used to determine D , are
functional [28] is used. The derivatives wH i
i

evaluated by averaging the values for 0 d f i d 1.0 with the constant interval of 0.1. Once the value of D i is
determined by Eq. (8), orbital energies for a neutral state are estimated by Eq. (9) in the post-SCF manner. All
calculations are carried out by the modified version of the GAMESS program [29].

3. Results and discussion
We examine orbital energies of NH3 with FON electrons and also assess the performance of the OS hybrid
functional by comparing IPs in the sense of Koopmans’ theorem.
3.1 Orbital energy
We investigate the FON dependence of orbital energies for NH3 molecule with LC-BLYP, HF+LYP, and OS
hybrid functionals using the cc-pCVTZ basis set [30]. The geometry is optimized at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level. Figs.
1(a) and (b) demonstrate orbital energies of HOMO and N1s with respect to FON electrons. As shown in Fig. 1(a),
the LC-BLYP HOMO curve seems approximately flat, i.e., nearly independent of FON electrons, whereas the
HF+LYP one significantly changes. For the OS hybrid functional, D HOMO is set to 0.0663 by the linearity condition.

Orbital energy [eV]

Since D HOMO is significantly small, the LC-BLYP and OS curves virtually coincide. The LC-BLYP and OS hybrid
functionals succeeded in producing an approximately constant curve.

NH3 molecule in order to assess the

performance of the OS hybrid functional. Since Koopmans’ theorem holds for HF, the HOMO IP of HF is
accurately estimated to be 11.62 eV, which is slightly larger than the experimental value 10.85 eV [31]. On the
contrary, the N1s IP is severely overestimated: 422.69 eV in comparison to the experimental value 405.6 eV [32].
As was reported that LC-BLYP can provide accurate IPs for valence electrons [16, 33-35], the HOMO IP is
reproduced with 0.03 eV deviation. However, LC-BLYP significantly underestimates core IP: the N1s core IP is
386.51 eV.
On the other hand, the OS hybrid functional estimates the HOMO IP as 10.99 eV, which is significantly close to
the experimental value. Moreover, the OS hybrid functional accurately predicts core N1s IP: 403.60 eV. The
appropriate selection of D i value in Eq. (8) causes the difference in the performances of LC-BLYP and OS hybrid
functionals. In general, the OS hybrid functional improves the performance by considering short-range (SR) HFx
and reducing the SIE.
3.2 Ionization potential for neutral molecule
In order to systematically assess the OS hybrid functional, IPs are estimated for a wide variety of molecules
containing not only second but also third row atoms: {CO, H2O, HCHO} and {PH3, H2S, HCl}. The geometry is
optimized at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ [30] level. The scalar relativistic effect is included by using the relativistic
scheme by eliminating small-components (RESC) method [36]. We discuss mean absolute deviations (MADs) from
experimental IPs for HF and DFT with BLYP [6, 7], B3LYP, LC-BLYP, and OS hybrid functionals using the ccpCVTZ basis set [30]. Core and valence excitations from 1s orbital and HOMO are examined. The more detailed
data can be found in Ref. 23. First, let us discuss MADs of molecules containing second row atoms. Although HF
satisfies Koopmans’ theorem, the MAD of HF is 11.21 eV. BLYP, B3LYP, and LC-BLYP also provide more than
10 eV MADs. On the other hand, the OS hybrid functional yields a significantly small MAD: 1.23 eV. Next, we
discuss MADs of molecules containing third row atoms. In general, MADs become larger since larger core IPs lead
to larger deviations. Although the MAD of HF is smaller than those of BLYP, B3LYP, LC-BLYP, all MADs exceed
10 eV. The OS hybrid functional accurately estimates IPs: the MAD is 1.08 eV. Finally, let us discuss the overall
performance. The OS hybrid functional offers the most well-balanced descriptions for all molecules: The total
MADs are 13.19, 27.47, 19.27, 21.88, and 1.17 eV for HF and DFT with the BLYP, B3LYP, LC-BLYP, and OS
hybrid functionals.
For valence orbitals the SR HFx portions are basically around 0.2 although a few ones are deviated from 0.2. For
the energy range 102 - 103 and 103 - 104 eV, the SR HFx portions are close to 0.5 and 0.7, respectively. Those SR
HFx portions of the present scheme are consistent with the HFx portions empirically determined in CVR-B3LYP.

3.3 Ionization potential for multiply charged Ar atom
We also examine the performance of the OS hybrid functional for multiply charged atoms Arq+ (q = 0 – 17). The
exact orbital energy of HOMO is equal to the experimental IP with a minus sign as proved in Ref. 25. The
uncontracted basis set of cc-pVTZ [30] is adopted in order to describe the highly charged cation. We discuss not
only the OS hybrid functional but also HF, BLYP, B3LYP, and LC-BLYP results for comparison. MADs are shown
in Table 2. The more detailed data can be found in Ref. 23.
For HF, the MAD is 0.54 eV for q = 0 – 7 and rise to 2.20 and 3.15 eV for q = 8 – 15 and q = 16, 17, respectively.
On the other hand, DFT with BLYP and B3LYP has a tendency to severely underestimate IPs in the case that q
becomes large: For example, MADs are 109.53 and 87.76 eV for q = 16, 17. In spite of the fact that it is reported
that LC-BLYP performs well for HOMOs, the MADs strongly depend on formal charges: LC-BLYP yields
relatively accurate IPs for q = 0 – 7 but provides large deviations for q = 8 – 17: MADs are 1.84, 22.05 and 103.78
eV, for q = 0 – 7, 8 – 15, and 16, 17, respectively. It is not necessarily true that LC-BLYP provides accurate HOMO

Yutaka Imamura et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1151–1156

IPs. On the other hand, the OS hybrid
functional provides relatively accurate IPs
for all charged states of Ar atom: 0.28,
1.48, and 3.50 eV for for q = 0 – 7, 8 – 15,
and 16, 17, respectively. The overall
MAD of the OS hybrid functional is 1.03
eV, which is significantly smaller than
those of BLYP, B3LYP, and LC-BLYP
and also slightly smaller than that of HF,
1.57 eV.

4. Conclusions
We have proposed a construction scheme of the OS hybrid functional using the linearity condition of the orbital
energy. Imposing the linearity condition drastically reduces deviations of IPs not only for outer and inner valence
orbitals but also for core orbitals including second and third row atoms. The SR HFx portions in the OS hybrid
functional are correlated with the CVR-B3LYP ones, which were determined by numerical assessment. The SCF
procedure and choice of XC functional for the OS hybrid functional is being developed and will be reported
elsewhere.
