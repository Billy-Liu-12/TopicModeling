Abstract
A 3rd order numerical model is developed for global advection transport computation. The multi-moment finite
volume method has been implemented to the hexagonal-pentagonal geodesic grid for spherical geometry. Two kinds
of moments, i.e. point value and volume-integrated average, are used as the constraint conditions to derive the time
evolution equations to update the computational variables, which are in the present model the values defined at the
specified points over each mesh element. The numerical model has rigorous numerical conservation and 3rd order
accuracy, and provides an accurate and practical formulation for advection calculation in the hexagonal-pentagonal
type geodesic grid.
Keywords: Global model, advection transport, multi-moment method, icosahedral geodesic grid,
hexagonal-pentagonal element, high order accuracy.

1. Introduction
Geodesic grids enjoy computational eﬃciency and overall accuracy from the quasi global uniformity of meshspacing, and thus have got an increasing popularity in the community of global modeling for atmospheric and oceanic
dynamics[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Two kinds of control volumes or mesh elements, i.e. triangular Delaunay tessellation and hexagonal Voronoi tessellation, can be straightforwardly generated for constructing finite volume schemes
for the geodesic grids. Since both triangular and hexagonal meshes on the sphere have the nature of unstructured
grids where the coordinate has to be cell-wisely defined and is not continuous at cell boundaries, the conventional
high order reconstructions devised for structured grids cannot be directly applied. High order finite volume method
usually needs to create multi-dimensional interpolation over a cluster of mesh cells which are not always chosen in
the most optimized way, and even worse, choice of the stencil might result in computational instability in some cases.
Eﬀorts have been so far reported to improve the advection calculation on the hexagonal geodesic grid [11, 12]. To
our knowledge, the existing finite volume schemes of flux form that make use of the cell-integrated average as the
computational variable possess second-order accuracy at most. Our previous studies show that locally increasing the
degrees of freedom (DOFs) is a practical and eﬃcient alternative to construct high order schemes on unstructured
grids [13, 14, 15].

In this paper, we present a third order finite volume formulation on the hexagonal-pentagonal geodesic grid for
global advection transport by using the multi-moment constrained finite volume (MCV) method[14]. Point values at
the vertices and the center of each hexagon are used as the computational variables which provide the local DOFs for
constructing the piecewise 2D interpolation function. The prognostic equations to update the computational variables
are derived from a set of constraint conditions in terms of two kinds of moments, i.e. the values at the vertices are
computed from the point-wise derivative Riemann solver and the cell center value is updated from a finite volume
formulation of flux-form. The cell integrated value is then rigorously conserved.
Section 2 briefly introduces the basic concept of MCV method in the 1D context, and section 3 describes the
MCV formulation on the hexagonal grid of planar geometry. The implementation on the geodesic hexagonal grid is
presented in section 4. Numerical tests that verify the present scheme are reported in section 5 followed by a short
conclusion in section 6.
2. MCV scheme in 1D
High-order MCV scheme was recently proposed in [14]. It uses the point values distributed within each mesh cell
as the computational variables, and thus does not explicitly involve any quadrature calculation, which not only makes
the computation quite eﬃcient but also provides great convenience in dealing with curved geometry and source terms.
Here, we briefly review the 3rd order numerical formulation for solving 1D transport equation,
∂t φ + ∂ x f = 0

(1)

where f = uφ is flux function and u velocity.
For 1D element Ci shown in Fig.1, unknowns (local DOFs) are defined for the transported field φ(x, t) as
φim (t) = φ (xim , t) (m = 1, 3) ,
where three local DOFs are equidistantly arranged, i.e. xi1 = xi− 12 , xi2 =

xi− 12 + xi+ 12 and xi3 = xi+ 12 .

where L represents spatial discretisation given above. We use the 3rd order TVD Runge-Kutta [16] scheme in the
present model.
3. MCV scheme on planar hexagonal grid
As shown in Fig.2, seven local DOFs (φim , m = 1, 7) are defined for a regular hexagonal element Ci with the side
length of a. They are located at the six vertices from Pi1 to Pi6 (counterclockwise) and the element center Pi7 , and
will be updated as the computational variables.
Single-cell based quadratic polynomial can be constructed based on 7 local DOFs as

The coeﬃcients are found by collocating the interpolating function to the 7 DOFs.
Same as in the 1D scheme, two kinds of moments are adopted as the constraint conditions, which are the PV
moments defined as

The advection transport equation is written in 2D as
∂t φ + ∇ · f = 0,

(18)

where f = (e, f ) = (uφ, vφ) is flux function vector, and v = (u, v) is velocity vector.
Considering point Pi1 , which is shared by hexagonal element Ci , C j and Ck (shown in Fig.3), diﬀerential-form of
governing equation (18) is written as

where vn = vi13 · nl6 is velocity component in the normal direction.
Line integration along other edges are computed by the same method, then spatial discretization in the evolution
eqution of VIA moment (24) is accomplished.
The time evolution equations for updating the DOFs are obtained by diﬀerentiating Eq.(17) with respect to time
and substituting Eqs.(19) and (24) to the right-hand sides of the resulting equations. Time integration is again computed by the 3rd -order Runge-Kutta scheme.
4. MCV scheme on hexagonal geodesic grid
Firstly, we construct the icosahedral-triangular grid following the method used in [9]. The finer grid is generated
by equally partitioning the edge (L) of the 20 primary triangles. We denote a grid whose triangular elements have

edge length of L/n by Gn . Then the center points of the neighboring five or six triangles sharing the same vertex
are connected by great circle arc, which forms spherical pentagonal or hexagonal elements as shown in Fig.4. The
vertices shared by these triangles now become the center points of the new pentagonal or hexagonal elements.
In the spherical geometry, the local DOFs are configured in the similar way as in the planar case described above.
However, special attention must be paid to the twelve pentagonal elements encompassing the 12 vertices of the 20
primary equilateral triangles. For these elements, we define and use six local DOFs including five at the vertices and
one at the cell center.
Spatial reconstruction is implemented in locally defined Lat/Lon coordinates. The quadratic polynomial is written
as
M

(Pim φim ) ,

Φi (λ, θ) =

(28)

where M = 7 in hexagonal elements and M = 6 in pentagonal elements.
In hexagonal elements, the basis function Pim is written as

(30)

In spherical control volume Ci , constraint conditions are defined by introducing the PV moments at vertices, i.e.
(t) (m = 1 to M − 1), and the VIA moment over the control volume V φi (t).
The relation between local DOFs and constraint conditions are

The length of edge |l| is the great-circle distance between the starting point P s = (λ s , θ s ) and the ending point

where point O is the origin of Cartesian grid at the sphere center.
Velocity vector is projected to 3D Cartesian grid by u = −˜u sin λ − v˜ sin θ cos λ, v = u˜ cos λ − v˜ sin θ sin λ and
w = v˜ cos θ, where (˜u, v˜ ) is the velocity in Lat/Lon grid.
Analogously, the time evolution equations of the DOFs are obtained by diﬀerentiating Eq.(31) and substituting
Eq.(32) and Eq.(37) to the right-hand sides of the resulting equations. Then the semi-discrete ODE is solved by the
3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme.
5. Numerical test
5.1. Convergence test
A solid rotation test with the velocity field give in [17] is computed on sphere to verify the convergence rate of the
present global model. Initial profile of adequate smoothness is given in the rotated Lat/Lon coordinates as
φ(λ , θ ) = sin λ cos θ ,

(40)

where origin of rotated Lat-Lon coordinates (λ , θ ) is located at (0, α).
We ran the model on a series of refined grids. Numerical results with three rotation directions, specified as α = 0,
α = π4 and α = π2 , are examined. We use the measures of numerical errors defined in [17]. The numerical errors and
convergence rate for the case of α = π4 are given in Table 1. It is observed that the results in all flow directions have
3rd order convergence rate, and there are not significant diﬀerences among them.

5.2. Deformational flow test
We calculated the global advection test of deformational flow introduced in [18]. 875 time steps are computed to
integrate the transported field to t = π on a G35 grid, and the elapse time required by an Intel Xeon E5520 CPU is
77.45s. Normalized errors of result calculated by 3rd order MCV model are l1 = 3.2339 × 10−5 , l2 = 1.2631 × 10−4 ,
l∞ = 6.7715 × 10−4 at t = π. Numerical results is given in Fig.6. Numerical height field is shown in the left panel of
Fig.6, which is visually identical to the exact solution shown in the right panel of Fig.6.
5.3. Moving vortices test
Moving vortices test was recently proposed in [19]. Diﬀerent from the previous test case where the center of
vortices are stationary, the vortex centers travel at the velocity of the solid rotation in this test. Detailed configuration
of this test are found in [19]. In this test, we define the initial condition with the vortex center initially located at
3π

2 , 0 . Three rotation directions are tested, corresponding to α = 0, α = 4 and α = 2 . MCV model runs on G18
grid to day 12 (one complete revolution for solid rotation of vortex center) and normalized errors are given in Table 2.
Numerical results on spherical hexagonal-pentagonal geodesic grid are almost independent of rotation directions.
We also evaluated the numerical results with diﬀerent grid resolutions of G9 , G18 and G36 . Total numbers of DOFs
on three grids are a little less than Lat/Lon grids of 72 × 36, 144 × 72 and 288 × 144 respectively. Numerical height
field and absolute height error of test with α = 0 on G36 grid are given in Fig.7. Time history of normalized l2 and l∞
errors are shown in Fig.8. Present model gives competitive results compared with the finite volume solution in [19]
(seeing Fig.7 therein).

6. Conclusion
We present a 3rd order advection transport scheme in spherical geometry by implementing the multi-moment finite
volume method to the hexagonal-pentagonal geodesic grid. The cell-wisely constructed interpolation is well suited
for the unstructured mesh configuration and gives 3rd order accuracy in numerical test. Compared to the conventional
finite volume method that requires a wide stencil for constructing high order scheme, the present scheme uses locally
defined DOFs and has much significant advantage when applied to geodesic grids. The present study show that the
MCV formulation is also promising for the hexagonal-pentagonal type geodesic grids as it is for the triangular grid
shown in our previous works.
