Abstract
We present a Virtual Dike simulation module developed as a part of a flood Early Warning System (EWS) for the UrbanFlood
project. The UrbanFlood EWS is a distributed system that analyzes sensor data received in real-time from flood defenses (dikes,
dams, etc.) and simulates dike stability, breaching and flood propagation. The aim of the Virtual Dike module is to develop an
advanced multiscale multiphysics simulation laboratory for expert users and numerical model developers. This lab is used to
validate simulation models, to plan experiments and to investigate physical processes influencing dike stability and failure. In the
first stage of the project, we have studied the structural stability of the Live Dike, a dike protecting a seaport in Groningen, the
Netherlands. The four cross-sections of the dike are equipped with sensors of pore pressure and inclination. For each section, 2D
simulations of flow through porous media and dike deformations have been performed under tidal water load. Simulation results
have been compared with the sensors data in order to calibrate soil properties. Pore pressure, stress dynamics and structural
stability of the dike have been analyzed.

1. Introduction
Recent catastrophic floods around the world have spawn a large number of projects aimed at the development of
stronger and “smarter” flood protection systems. The FP7 project SSG4Env is focused on development of semantic
sensor grids for environment. Flood Probe (also funded by FP7) coordinates work on combination of sensor
measurement techniques. Flood Control 2015 is aiming to share sensor measurements datasets and provide a user
interface to explore sensor data for researchers, technical maintainers and civil population. The IJkdijk project [1] is
a unique experimental series to investigate dike failure mechanisms. The tests are carried out on full-scale
experimental dikes equipped with large sets of sensors. The project has produced extremely detailed and precious
datasets of sensor data, including pore pressure, inclination and temperature measurements. The project data are
available to the scientific community and can serve for gaining better knowledge and understanding of dike failure
mechanisms.
The UrbanFlood EC FP7 project [2,3,4] is the first endeavor that unites the work on all the aspects studied in the

projects mentioned above. One of the key challenges is the development of computational models. Here we describe
a Virtual Dike module for analyzing dike stability and predicting risk of dike failure.
The Virtual Dike is being developed as an advanced multiscale multiphysics simulation lab for expert users and
model developers. This virtual lab is used for validation of all the models involved in the modeling cascade, and
serves as a research field for experiment planning and understanding the underlying physical processes influencing
dike stability and failure. Comparison of simulation results with the experimental data allows determining the
material properties and computational model parameters that best represent real-life dikes, with all their
inhomogeneities and special features.
Structural analysis of dike stability includes analyzing several possible failure mechanisms, different in their
physical nature and acting on different scales. These mechanisms are slope instability, surface erosion and piping.
Surface erosion and piping are caused by particles washed out of the soil by water; they act on microscopic scale.
Engineering criteria used nowadays to predict these phenomena are obtained using macroscopic description of these
mechanisms with some heuristic corrections [17]. A detailed study would require fluid flow modeling coupled with
particle dynamics modeling. Slope instability can be characterized as macroscopic physical process: failure happens
when sliding between planes of the material occurs. In this case soil can be considered as continuous media with
elastic or elasto-plastic constitutive behavior [7,16]. The problem requires modeling of flow through porous media
and solving structural task to analyze dike stability. Pore pressure, acting inside of the material as volume load, is
transferred to the structural part of analysis and affects stresses and deformations in the soil, usually unloading the
construction (the effect was first observed by K. Terzaghi [5]). Backward influence of pores expansion, giving
additional source terms in porous flow equation, makes a task highly non-linear, fully coupled fluid-structure
interaction problem. M.A. Biot [6] was one of the first researchers to investigate this, using Darcy’s equation for
porous flow and linear elastic theory in structural analysis. Biot poroelasticity theory is widely used for modeling
macroscopic behavior of soils with porous flow [6]. If a dike is subjected to a dynamic tidal load, the phreatic
surface (a border between saturated and unsaturated zones in soil) changes its location and shape dynamically. This
effect can be taken into consideration either by solving Darcy’s equation in saturated zone using finite element (FE)
method with deforming mesh [10] or using special computational techniques with a fixed FE mesh (built for the
whole soil domain), finding unsaturated cells and excluding their contribution to the system of FE flow equations
[9]. Another way to solve this problem is to use Richards equation, modeling wetting and drying of the soil. This
allows to get phreatic surface shape automatically and moreover, to take into consideration raining condition. In the
present work, we use Richards equation with the Van Genuchten model [8] for porous flow in unsaturated zone,
coupled with linear elastic structural equations.
2. A test case: sea dike in Eemshaven
LiveDike is protecting a seaport in Groningen, see Figure 1a. This dike has been equipped with sensors, and data
stream is available in real-time via a LiveDike Dashboard [11].

Sensor GPS locations are shown in Figure 1b. Sensors are placed in four dike cross-sections, see Figure 2a. These
cross-sections have been simulated in 2D models under tidal water loading. Simulation results have been compared
with the pore pressure sensors data in order to calibrate model parameters, so that virtual and real sensor values
agree.

longitudinal cross-section

LiveDike internal structure is well documented. UrbanFlood community has been granted access to the data on
soil build-up shown in Figure 2b. The dike consists mainly of building sand (light orange color) with a 60 cm layer
of clay on top (light blue stripe). Below the dike lies a coarse sand (yellow area), with some smaller zones of sand
mixed with clay layers (light green). Besides that, there are clay zones lying below the depth of 15 m (light blue)
and Pleistocene sand below the depth of 20 m (bright orange), but these deep areas were not included into a
simulation domain for the present simulation (see Section 3.2).
3. Virtual Dike modeling approach
3.1. Governing equations
The problem requires modelling of coupled fluid-structure interaction, with non-linear dike material properties.
The fluid sub-model describes the dynamics of flow through porous soil, with the pressure-based form of Richards
equation [14,15] for wetting and drying of the area above phreatic surface. The Van Genuchten model [8] is used to
describe the properties of unsaturated soil. The pore volume expands with the expansion of the media, therefore
water content increases. This process is modeled with additional source term in the right hand side of the Richards
equation:
K
∂p
∂ε
(C + θ e S )
,
(1)
+ ∇ ⋅ [− S k r ∇( p + ρgz )] =
μ
∂t
∂t
where ε = ε x + ε y is coefficient of volume expansion of porous media, obtained form structural equations (2); p is
pressure, [Pa]; C =C(p) is specific moisture capacity [1/Pa], C = ș/p; θ e = θ e (p) is effective water content; S is a
storage coefficient, [1/Pa]; t is time, [s]; KS is permeability of saturated media, [m2]; kr=kr(h) is relative
permeability, computed using Van Genuchten formulas [8]; ȝ is dynamic viscosity of water, [Pa·s]; g is standard
gravity, [m/s2]; ȡ is water density [kg/m3]; z stands for coordinate of vertical elevation, [m].
The structural sub-model describes deformation dynamics of the dike under tidal pressure load, gravity and
volumetric pore pressure p load obtained from flow simulation. Linear elastic constitutive behavior is used for
describing sand and clay properties:
­°∇ ⋅ σ − ∇p + ρ s g = 0

where σ = σ ij ei e j , i, j = 1,2 is effective stress tensor [Pa] with component matrix σ ij = «

coordinate basis; λ , μ are Lame parameters, [Pa]; g is gravity vector, ρ s is soil density, [kg/m3]; ∇ is Laplace
differential operator.
Dike stability is evaluated by Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for materials with no cohesion [7], which shows
that failure occurs when shear stress acting on some plane reaches the limit of material resistance provided by an
internal friction mechanism. The condition of dike stability is then as follows:
τ m ≤ σ m tan φ for all material points in the simulation domain,
where φ is friction angle [grad], τ m is maximal shear stress in the point, [Pa]; σ f is corresponding normal stress in
the point, [Pa].
Bishop criterion, which is widely used in engineering practice to detect a slope stability margin, employs MohrCoulomb criterion as a basis with an additional assumption that the slip surface is circular [7].
In terms of principal stresses, Mohr-Coulomb criterion can be written as
σ −σ 3 σ1 +σ 3
stab ≥ 0 , where stab = 1
tan φ ,
−
2
2
where σ 1 is maximal principal stress, σ 3 is minimal principal stress. The value of stab=0 indicates the onset of
local instability; stab < 0 denotes an unstable condition; and stab > 0 predicts stability. Negative values of stab in a
relatively large continuous zone predict dike failure.
3.2. Computational domain and meshing
We consider a two-dimensional planar model of the LiveDike transversal cross-section. The dike itself is 9 meter
high and about 60 meter wide. We have added into a simulation domain a fragment of sea floor below the dike,
which is 120 m wide and 20 m deep. The simulation domain is shown in Figure 3a. The domain includes three
homogeneous zones: clay (red layer on top of the dike), sand1 (blue area in the middle) and sand2 (grey zone in the
bottom). This is a simplified model of the real soil distribution, adopted for the initial tests. The model only includes
vertical inhomogeneity. Later it will be shown that horizontal inhomogeneity should also be considered in order to
obtain a good agreement between simulation results and sensor data (see Section 4).
The finite element mesh (Figure 3b) was built in Comsol software package [12]. It consists of triangular finite
elements of second order. Refinement zone is located around phreatic line, where flow parameter gradients can be
high and dynamically changing. The total number of elements is about 15000.

3.3. Boundary conditions
The sensor data from sea water level is employed in the model via harmonic approximation of the signal, which
is applied as a boundary condition (see Figure 4).
Boundary condition zones are presented in Figure 5. Boundary conditions for the structural sub-model are:
At the seaside (green line in Figure 5a) pressure is calculated as

where hamp = 1.5 m is the amplitude of tidal oscillation of sea water level; ω = 2π / T is radial frequency of the

tidal cycle, and tidal period T = 12 hrs 25 min; y [m] is a vertical coordinate relative to the reference water level.
At the vertical borders (red lines in Figure 5a), a symmetry condition is imposed (displacements normal to
boundary are zero). The base of the body is fixed (blue line). Remaining borders are free (black lines).
Boundary conditions for the flow sub-model are the following:
At the inlet (black line in Figure 5b) pressure is calculated as
p = ρg[hamp ⋅ sin(ω (t − t 0 )) − y ] .

At the outlet (cyan line in Figure 5b) water level stays at the Dutch water reference level (common abbreviation
for the reference level in Dutch is NAP), therefore pressure can be defined as
p = − ρgy .

3.4. Initial conditions
In order to begin transient simulations, we need to obtain initial pressure and saturation distribution in the dike.
For that purpose additional transient simulation with stationary boundary conditions has been performed. Boundary
conditions at the inlet and at the outlet are set p = − ρgy (water level is at the NAP, Netherlands reference sea
level). This simulation starts form an arbitrary pressure distribution (constant, uniform) and converges to the steadystate pressure distribution used in the transient simulations as initial condition.
3.5. Implementation
Partial differential equations (1), (2) with the boundary conditions (3-5) are solved by the finite element method:
the computational domain is discretized into small elements; and original equations are reduced to a system of
ordinary differential equations solved by an implicit time integration scheme. Simulations have been performed in
the finite element software package Comsol [13].
The equations are non-linear due to the non-linear constitutive behavior of the soil and fluid-structure coupling
phenomenon. Iterative Newton-Raphson method has been used to linearize differential equations at each integration
step. Direct parallel UMFPACK and PARDISO solvers have been used for solving the system of linear algebraic
equations within each iteration.
Porous flow simulations typically require up to 2 GB of RAM. Each simulation took about 2 hours to perform on
two processors of a laptop AMD Athlon Dual-Core 1.9 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, under Windows operating system.
Coupled fluid-structure problem requires up to 8 GB of memory and 6-10 hours to perform on Intel Xeon Dual Core
PC 3 Hz, 8 GB of RAM. The solver has been ported to SARA [18] Clouds to run time-consuming coupled
simulations.
SARA HPC cloud system is hosted on a 128-core cluster equipped with the dual quad-core 2.2 GHz CPUs.
SARA employs OpenNebula open source cloud computing management toolkit with KVM as the Virtual machine
software. Clouds are customized for the specific simulation. The number or cores (from 1 to 8) and the amount of
RAM (up to 24 GB) are set according to the required calculation time. Clouds have 500 GB local hard disk space
with the 100 TB backup storage. Aggregated connection speed from the cluster to storage is 20 Gb/s. Clouds are
also provided with the high-speed 1 Gb/s network.
4. Parallel efficiency benchmarking

Parallel efficiency of the UMFPACK and PARDISO solvers has been tested on SARA Clouds in shared memory
mode on 2, 4, 6 and 8 computational cores. Number of degrees of freedom varied from 60 000 to 250 000, which
corresponds to small and medium model size. The value of parallel efficiency varied from almost ideal 98 % (for 2
cores, 250 000 unknowns) to 15 % (for 8 cores, 60 000 unknowns). Overall tendency has proved that the efficiency
is highest when we use a small number of cores and a large number of unknowns (see Figure 6). A more detailed
description of the parallel tests is given in [12]. Low parallel efficiency (less then 50%) has been observed for
number of cores 6 and 8. The reason may lie in high process synchronization costs, but this issue should be
investigated with a parallel profiler.

5. Simulation results

Pore pressure fields are shown in Figure 7 for the high and low tides. The unsaturated zone is shown with the
white color, so that the phreatic line is depicted as a boundary between saturated and unsaturated zones.
During the high tide, water level is higher at the sea side (left boundary). At the right-hand side, phreatic surface
is fixed due to the impose boundary condition – stationary water level. As we recently found, at the meeting with the
dike manager, recently a channel corresponding with the sea has been dug along the dike at the landside and
therefore the right-hand side boundary condition shall be corrected. As animations showed, the phreatic line is
moving like a wave (with one end fixed), due to the harmonic dynamics of the tidal water load.

Fragments of the effective saturation field at the seaside are shown in Figure 8 for the high and low tides.
During the low tide, water level inside the dike decreases and the sand located above the water table gets dry
(yellow color in Figure 8a). During the low tide the upper layer of clay, located above the water table, stays wet due
to high water capacity of clay. In the high tide phase, water table rises and that can be seen in Figure 8b (blue
saturated zone has enlarged, relatively to the Figure 8a).

Structural displacements field in one moment of time is shown in Figure 9a. The displacements are composed of:
a) static soil settlement under gravity load (maximal at the top of the dike) and b) transient displacements resulting
from tidal pressure at the seaside and volume pore pressure load. Total displacements are maximal at the top of the
dike due to gravity settlement component. The field of stability parameter stab in one moment of time is shown in
Figure 9b. At tidal load stab is positive and the dike is stable.

We have considered two different values of saturated permeability KS for coarse sand, located in the deep part of
the dike (gray zone in Figure 3a): KS =10-9 m2 and KS =10-10 m2. In each case, a comparison of numerical results with
real sensor data has been performed for pore pressure dynamics. The comparison has been made in the points of
sensor locations. For the Livedike, in each section we have 3 sensors located in saturated zone and providing
informative pore pressure data (they are shown in Figure 10 within green circle). A comparison has been made for
all the points, in four sections of the dike. The results are shown in Figure 10 for the section #1, for two sensors.
Real sensor signals are shown with bold lines (green – sensor “E4”, blue – sensor “G2”). “Virtual” sensor signals
(obtained from simulation) are shown with thin lines. For sensor “E4” (left plot), located in the coarse sand zone, the
agreement is quite good for value of KS =10-9 m2. Sensor “G2” is located in the same zone as “E4”, but real sensor
shows that the amplitude of pore pressure oscillations is much lower for “G2” than for “E4”. The reason for this
difference is in local inhomogeneities of the soil, which must be taken into consideration in further simulations.
Comparison of the data for sensor “G2” shows that the real sensor is placed in a less permeable zone than the zone
of the virtual sensor is. In virtual model, permeability values will be corrected and G2 sensors will be surrounded
with less permeable soil.

6. Conclusions and plans

Pore pressure and stress dynamics in the dike have been obtained in the present work, under tidal load.
Comparison of real and virtual pore pressure sensor data shows that local inhomogeneities should be included into
the model to properly simulate real water pressure dynamics. Parallel efficiency of the Comsol UMFPACK and
PARDISO solvers has been tested, in shared memory mode. Low parallel efficiency (less then 50%), possibly
caused by high process synchronization costs, has been observed for number of cores 6 and 8.
For the LiveDike porous flow modelling, we plan to implement a more detailed heterogeneous soil model in
order to obtain a better agreement between the pore pressure fields from real sensors and from simulations. Flood
condition is to be investigated, including porous flow modelling and dike slope stability analysis. Simulations will
be performed on the SARA Clouds. Next, we will model dike failure mechanisms based on the IJkdijk experiments,
including slope instability, piping and surface erosion. In addition, we plan to explore the system identification
theory approach to build simplified models based on the sensor data analysis and advanced modelling. Finally, the
Virtual Dike will be integrated into the Common Information Space to receive sensor input automatically and to
produce real-time simulation results for displaying them on a multi-touch table or a web-based decision support
system.
