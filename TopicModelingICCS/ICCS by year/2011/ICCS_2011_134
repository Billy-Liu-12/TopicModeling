Abstract
Solvation structure and gelation ability of novel oligomeric electrolyte poly(pyridinium-1,4-diyliminocarbonyl-1,4phenylenemethylene chloride) (1·Cl) as well as its derivatives 1·X obtained by counterion substitution: X¯ = BF4¯ , PF6¯ , TFSA¯ ,
I¯ , SCN¯ , DCA¯ , ClO4¯ , SO3CF3¯ have been studied by quantum chemistry methods and integral equation theory of molecular
liquids. The interaction energy, 'Etot, between the counterions and polymer chains has been estimated in the frame of density
functional theory and COSMO model. The calculations show that 'Etot for gel forming polyelectrolytes has rather high values.
For cases when gel formation is not observed experimentally, calculated 'Etot have generally lower values. The excess chemical
potential of ions (xPion) in water, methanol, dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile at infinite dilution has been estimated by means of
the integral equation theory of molecular liquids, 1D-RISM-KH. According to the xPion values obtained, the higher gelation
ability is observed for 1·X in which counterions X¯ have the higher absolute values of the solvation free energies. The threedimensional solvation structure of 1·Cl in aqueous solution has been analyzed by means of 3D-RISM-KH approach.

Keywords: polyelectrolyte, gelation, solvation, DFT, RISM

1. Introduction
Hydrogels derived from natural and synthetic compounds are very important owing to their numerous practical
applications for biology and industry [1]. In particular, synthetic gelators are extremely promising because their
properties are readily tunable by chemical functionalization. Recently the novel oligomeric electrolyte
poly(pyridinium-1,4-diyliminocarbonyl-1,4-phenylenemethylene chloride) (1·Cl) having pyridinium and amide
moieties in its main chain has been synthesized [2]. The new oligomeric gelator 1·Cl was prepared by a one-pot
synthesis involving condensation and subsequent intermolecular quaternization reaction [2]. Further experimental
studies of the ionic gelators 1·Cl revealed its unique characteristics: (i) tunable solubility in various solvents (e.g.,

organic, aqueous) and ionic liquids by a simple anion-exchange reaction [2, 3]; (ii) gelatinization of the ionic liquid
without impairing its ionic conductivity [3, 4]; (iii) outstanding self-healing property [5]; (iv) dispersant property for
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) [2, 4]. Therefore the following oligomeric electrolytes 1·BF4, 1·PF6,
1·BPh4, 1·TFSA, 1·I, 1·SCN, 1·DCA, 1·ClO4, 1·SO3CF3 were prepared by the anion exchange reaction using 1·Cl as
a starting material [3]. It was found that anion exchange reaction dramatically changes the solubility and gelation
ability of the oligomeric electrolytes 1·X [3]. In addition, effect of salt content on the rheological properties of the
hydrogel based on 1·Cl has been explored [6] and it was shown that the recovery of the mechanical properties of
1·Cl hydrogel is completely reduced in the presence of salts.
In spite of thorough experimental investigations there is not enough understanding of the solvation structure of
the 1·X polymers and factors influencing their gelation ability. In present work we report a quantum chemical study
of 1·X polymers structure, charge distribution, energies of counterions attraction to the polymeric chains and
predictions of the solvation structure of 1·Cl polymer in aqueous solution by means of the integral equation theory
of molecular liquids.
2. Methods

2.1. Calculations by quantum chemistry methods
Geometry optimization of polymeric chain and counterions has been carried out in the frame of density
functional theory with the gradient-corrected functional of Hamprecht, Cohen, Tozer and Handy (HCTH) [7] and
numerically derived basis set DNP of double-zeta quality with polarization functions [8]. Core electrons were
described by the density functional semi-core pseudopotentials [9]. Solvent effects were taken into account by
Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) [10]. The charges obtained by fitting them so as to reproduce the
molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) [11] were calculated and used in the further calculations in the frame of
reference interaction site model (RISM). Computational results were obtained using software programs from
Accelrys Software Inc. In particular, ab initio calculations were performed with the DMol3 program, and graphical
displays of those calculations’ results were generated with Materials Studio [12]. Pictures of structural formulas are
prepared using ChemDraw Ultra 10.0 suite of ChemOffice 2006.
2.2. Calculations by integral equation theory of molecular liquids
The three-dimensional distribution functions of interaction sites of solvent molecules and counterions near the
solute molecule of the polymer were calculated within the frame of the 3D-RISM-KH integral equation theory of
molecular liquids [13]. To represent the system for 3D-RISM-KH calculations we used structures and charges
obtained on the quantum chemical level of description. Van der Waals parameters for 1·X polymers were adopted
from OPLSaa forcefield [14]. Particularly, parameters for BF4¯ and SO3CF3¯ anions were taken from [15], for PF6¯
ion from [16], for TFSA¯ ion from [17], for DCA¯ ion from [18], and for ClO4¯ ion from [19]. Van der Waals
parameters for sulfur atom of SCN¯ anion are the same as for sulfur atoms in SO3CF3¯ and TFSA¯ , while for
carbon and nitrogen atoms of SCN¯ we used the same parameters as for CN groups of DCA¯ ion. Van der Waals
parameters for Cl¯ and I¯ ions were taken from Ref. [20] The excess chemical potential of ions or the “solvation
free energy” at infinite dilution has been calculated in the frame of 1D-RISM-KH approach [21] for four solvents:
water, methanol, dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile. Solvents were considered using united atom OPLSua
parameters borrowed from the following sources: [22] for methanol, [23] for dimethylsulfoxide and [24] for
acetonitrile. Water model used in this work is extended simple point charge model (SPC/E) [25]. Pictures of threedimensional distribution functions are prepared using a molecular visualization program VMD
(http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) [26].

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Geometry and charge distribution
Structural formulas of 1·X polymers studied in the present work are presented in Figure 1. Polymeric chains are
built by substituting one of three hydrogen atoms of the sp3 carbon connecting monomers (Fig. 2). We have
performed the geometry optimization of the polymeric chain of seven-bead length. Analysis of the optimized
structure shows that the pyridinuim ring and amide group of every monomer lie in the same plane, but the phenyl
ring is out of this plane (Fig. 2).

ESP derived partial atomic charges of the monomer are presented in Figure 3a. Polar hydrogen atoms of amide
groups are highly charged (+0.343, Fig. 3a). The hydrogen atoms of the rings are also positively charged and two of
them having charges +0.240 and +0.134 are oriented toward the amide hydrogen. Altogether they form a wide
positively charged area (+0.717, Fig. 4) which is one of the most probable locations for negatively charged

counterion. Other two positively charged regions are formed around hydrogen atoms of the -CH2- fragment,
pyridinium and phenyl rings (+0.534 and +0.519, Fig. 4). These two areas create additional favorable positions for
counterions along the polymeric chain. Every monomer carries positive charge +1 which is mainly distributed over
pyridinium ring (+0.859, Fig. 3b). Phenyl ring is slightly positively charged (+0.129), while -CH2- and amide group
are almost neutral (+0.085 and -0.079, respectively).

phenyl ring and -CH2- fragments

hydrogen atoms of each area

3.2. Interaction energies between polymeric chains, and anions and ions solvation energies
To estimate the strength of the counterion and the chain attraction two calculations have been run for every 1·X
polymer: (i) geometry optimization of the polymer chain with counterions located in the vicinity of the chain amide
group, and (ii) geometry optimization of the polymers when counterions are moved away from the chain to the
distance of 12 Å and their central atoms were fixed. The difference in the total energies ('Etot), including COSMO
effects, is considered as the measure of interaction between the chain and the counterion. These energies have been
calculated for nine 1·X polymers. The solvent nature was accounted by the appropriate COSMO settings for
different solvents. To speed up calculations, the polymer chain has been considered in periodic boundary conditions
with the repeat unit consisting of two connected monomers carrying the charge +2. Therefore two negatively

1190

charged counterions were added into the periodic cell to keep the system electroneutrality. The approximate initial
positions of counterions were predicted by 3D-RISM-KH calculation results.
The theoretically predicted 'Etot as well as the experimental data on the solubility and gelation ability of 1·X
electrolytes [3] are presented in Table 1. Experimental data, Ref. [3], are available for 13 different solvents. Here we
consider six of them: water, methanol (MeOH), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
acetonitrile (AN) and propylene carbonate (PC), in which the 1·X polymers are soluble.
The gel formation can be seen as the result of formation of relatively strong crosslinks between the different
chains. Counterions participate in these crosslinks formation. The stronger attraction between the counterion and the
chain means that the stronger link between different chains can be formed. Therefore somewhat higher probability
of the gel formation can be expected in systems with stronger interaction between the chain and counterion.
Analysis of the calculated 'Etot shows that in most cases gel is observed for the counterions with the rather high
values of interaction energies 'Etot.
Since the all three components: positively charged polymer chain, negatively charged counterion and the solvent
participate in the formation of the gel network, it is important to analyze the interactions between the solutes and
solvents.
The excess chemical potential of ions, or the solvation free energy at infinite dilution, is presented in Table 1 for
counterions in water, methanol, dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile. The more negative value of xPion of the ion
means its stronger favorable interaction with the solvent. According to the xPion values obtained, the higher gelation
ability is observed for 1·X in which counterions X¯ have the higher absolute values of the solvation free energies. In
the case of 1·TFSA the gel is formed in methanol solution only where xPion of TFSA ion has the highest absolute
value 35.64 kcal/mol. In the case of 1·BF4 the absolute value of the excess chemical potential of BF4¯ is much
higher in water than in DMSO where the gel is not experimentally observed.

3.3. Three-dimensional solvation structure of 1·Cl polyelectrolyte
The highest values of the three-dimensional function of counterion Cl¯ , presented in Figure 5a, points out the
regions with the highest probability to find Cl¯ anion. It is well seen that the green clouds appear near the positively
charged areas around the polymer: amide group hydrogen region and two places between phenyl and pyridinium
rings connected through the -CH2- group. This distribution well agrees with the assumptions resulted from the
analysis of charge distribution of the polymer chain.

Fig. 5. (a) Three-dimensional distribution function of Cl¯ ion around the polymer chain (b) three-dimensional distribution function of Ow
(red) and Hw (gray) sites of water around the polymer chain (a two monomers fragment of seven-bead chain is shown in both cases)

The solvation structure of the polymer chain in aqueous solution is presented in Figure 5b, where the threedimensional distribution functions of oxygen (Ow) and hydrogen (Hw) sites of water are shown. The higher
probability to find water sites is around hydrophilic parts of the chain: polar amide groups and positively charged
areas between phenyl and pyridinium rings connected through -CH2- group. The closest contacts between water and
polymer chain in the first solvation shell can be expected in these areas. It is well seen that water molecules avoids
coming in close contact with the hydrophobic fragments of the polymer chain.
4. Conclusions
In present work we structurally characterized the polymeric molecules 1·X and based on the results obtained by
DFT methods we developed the model used in further RISM calculations to investigate the solvation structure of
1·Cl polyelectrolyte.
Based on the theoretically predicted values of the interaction energy between counterions and polymer chains we
show that counterion type strongly affects the gelation ability of the polyelectrolytes 1·X. The stronger counterion
attraction to the polymer chain means the higher probability of the gel formation. The calculated 'Etot has higher
values for 1·X with the higher gelation ability, according to the experimental data [3].
Excess chemical potential of solvation for ions calculated in the present work have been analyzed taking into
account experimental results on the gelation ability of 1·X. The higher absolute values of xPion are observed for ions
of gel forming polymers.
Solvation structure of 1·Cl electrolyte has been obtained by means of the 3D-RISM-KH approach. Three
dimensional distribution functions for Cl¯ shows that with the high probability Cl¯ can be found in the vicinity of
polar hydrogen atom of amide group. Other two positively charged areas have been found between pyridinium and
phenyl rings connected through the -CH2- group. As the consequence, in these areas three-dimensional distribution
function for Cl¯ ion has high values.
