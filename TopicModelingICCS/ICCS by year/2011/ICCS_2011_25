Abstract
We propose a new scheme of the photoactivation and the photobleaching for Dronpa with molecular dynamics method and
density functional theory. These processes can be explained by considering cis-trans isomerization in neutral state of
chromophore. The proton transfer from anionic to neutral chromophore makes cis-trans isomerization possible via hula-twist
rotation process, since the space for cis-trans isomerization is opened at around the region near chromophore by moving out of
the imidazole ring on H193 from the position below the phenol ring on chromophore. Then the cis-trans isomerization can occur
through the hula-twist process. The contributions from the protein environment around CRO, especially S142 and H193, are
indispensable for photoconversion of Dronpa.

1. Introduction
In 1960's Shimomura et al.1 discovered green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jellyfish (Æquorea victoria).
Nowadays, many fluorescent proteins are applied to a biological marker in the wide area such as molecular biology,
medicine, and cellbiology.2 In particular, photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (PAFPs)3 draw attention as a useful
tool to directly observe the movement of some biomolecules at multiple time points in individual cells. The PAFPs
are capable of changes in their spectral properties in response to irradiation with light of a specific wavelength and
intensity.
Recently, Ando et al.4 purified Dronpa from a coral protein. Dronpa has a property of reversible photoconversion
from a green fluorescent state (bright state) to non fluorescent state (dark state). Such property of Dronpa is applied
to the analysis of the heretofore unexplored regulation of fast protein dynamics, and there are also some reports to
enhance the fluorescent characters for Dronpa5, 6. In the bright state, Dronpa has an absorption major peak at 503 nm
(2.46 eV), and an emission peak at 518 nm (2.39 eV) with a very high fluorescence quantum yield (IFL=0.85).

Intense irradiation with blue light (470-510 nm) for bright state converts to the dark state with the absorption peak at
390 nm (3.18 eV). This photophysical behavior is called photobleaching. In contrast, irradiation with UV laser (390410 nm) for the dark state converts to bright state, and such photophysical behavior is called photoactivation. Ando
et al.7 reported that the phenol (hydroxyphenyl) moieties on chromophore (CRO) of Dronpa in bright and dark states
are anionic and neutral forms, respectively, by NMR analysis. Andersen et al.8 reported that the CROs in each state
are cis and trans forms, respectively, by X-ray structural analysis. These reports mean that both the excited-state
proton transfer (ESPT) and the cis-trans isomerization are important for the photoconversion in Dronpa.
To explore the mechanism of such reversible photoconversion of Dronpa, some experimental and theoretical
papers were already reported9-12. Nam et al.9 pointed out that there was no space at around the region near CRO in
the structures of bright state, and a large conformational change was indispensable for the cis-trans isomerization of
the CRO. Recently, Miyawaki et al.11 suggested the photoconversion scheme of Dronpa. In this scheme,
photobleaching occurred from cis form of anionic CRO (B state) into trans form of neutral CRO (A2 state), while the
photoactivation occurred from the A2 to the B states via non-fluorescent intermediate form (I state). They proposed
that some species in the excited B state does not turn into the A2 state, but into the "unknown dark-state (D state)",
and then converts into the B state spontaneously. They also suggested that the A2 state converts into the I state
slowly in "ground state".
There are some reports for the calculation of model structures of CRO, since it is very difficult to calculate large
molecules such as whole proteins in excited state. For instance, absorption energies were compared between
theoretical and experimental values for many CROs13, 14. In addition, some studies about production and decay of the
fluorescent state were reported, and the decay channel along a space-saving hula-twist process through a conical
intersection was proposed.15 To our knowledge, however, the mechanism for photoconversion in Dronpa is not
known, yet.
In this paper, thus, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to qualitatively understand the reaction path considering the effect of conformation change for whole
Dronpa and to propose the new scheme of photoconversion (photoactivation and photobleaching) in Dronpa. In
Section 2, we describe the computational details of MD and DFT calculations. In Section 3, some results of our
calculations are reported. First, MD calculations were performed to explore the difference between neutral and
anionic structures of CRO in cis form. Second, to elucidate the mechanism of cis-trans isomerization, we performed
some MD and DFT calculations of cis, trans, and corresponding approximate transition state structures for CRO
model and whole protein. From our results, we would propose a new scheme of the photoswitching on Dronpa.
Finally, we would like to draw our conclusions in Section 4.
2. Computational Details

2.1. Molecular dynamics simulation
The MD calculations were performed for the system which contains whole Dronpa and 6819 water molecules, as
shown in Figure 1, in truncated octahedral cell with the periodic boundary condition using AMBER 916 program
package. We calculated cis structures with anionic (anionic cis) and neutral (neutral cis) CRO forms, and trans
structure with neutral (neutral trans) CRO form. The AMBER17, 18 and TIP3P19 force fields were used for whole
Dronpa and water molecules, respectively. For CRO, in particular, a general AMBER force field (GAFF)18 was used.
We have already checked the validation of the GAFF for CRO in our previous work.20
The initial coordinates were picked up from 2Z1O7 PDB, and hydrogen atoms were added to the anionic cis and
the neutral cis forms, based on the structures proposed by Mizuno et al.7 As the initial coordinate for the trans form,
we substituted trans CRO for cis CRO in the 2Z1O PDB structure. The energy minimization was carried out from
these three structures. Then, we performed the NVT-MD simulation at 300 K from minimized structures to obtain
the thermally averaged structures. The time step and total simulation time are 2.0 fs and 4.0 ns (2,000,000 steps),
respectively.

and pink rolls, respectively.

2.2. Density functional theory calculations
We calculated cis, trans, and corresponding transition state (TS) for anionic and neutral 4-hydroxy-benzylidene1,2-dimethylimidazoline (HBDI) known as a model structure of CRO,21, 22 as shown in Figure 2, using Gaussian 03
program package.23 We assume the TS structure with the constraint of two dihedral angles of I and W in Figure 2,
that is, (I, W ) = (0.0, ±90.0) and (±90.0, ±90.0) are fixed for TS structures via simple W (ST) and hula-twist (HT)
rotations, respectively, because of the limitation of our computational facilities. The equilibrium structures were
optimized with B3LYP/6-31G* level for S0 state, and calculated the energies of S1 state under these structures with
TD-B3LYP/6-31G*. It is reported that the B3LYP functional calculations can be reproduced qualitatively the
excited energies for some CROs of some fluorescent proteins.13, 14
We have also performed the single point ONIOM calculation of whole Dronpa and 2021 water molecules for the
structures minimized with AMBER force filed. We defined the CRO corresponding to HBDI, water46, and the parts
from D-carbon on H193 to D-carbon on I195 as high-level layer with B3LYP or TD-B3LYP/6-31G*, and the other
residues and water molecules as low-level layer with AMBER force field.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Protein structures with the neutral cis and the anionic cis CRO with MD calculations
MD calculations of whole Dronpa with 6819 water molecules were performed to analyze the difference between
the neutral cis and the anionic cis forms. The energy of the anionic cis form is 70.0 kcal/mol lower than that of the
neutral cis form. We focus on the three hydrogen-bonding distances between oxygen atom on phenol ring at CRO
and oxygen atom on hydroxyl group at S142 (R1), oxygen atom on peptide group at S142 and nitrogen atom on
peptide group at H193 (R2), and nitrogen atom on peptide group at S142 and oxygen atom on peptide group at H193
(R3) as shown in Figure 3(a).
Figure 4 shows the distributions of these distances for (a) the anionic cis and (b) the neutral cis forms,
respectively. The neutral cis form is a proton transfered structure from the anionic cis form. The considerable
difference between the anionic and the neutral structures is found for the distributions of R1, each peak are observed
around 2.7 Å and 4.0 Å, respectively. Our result clearly supports the experimental results by NMR7, where S142
does not form a hydrogen-bonding to CRO in neutral form, while S142 forms a hydrogen-bonding in the anionic
form.

Fig. 6. The two-dimensional distributions of dihedralangles I and W in the anionic cis (a) and the neutral cis (b) forms.

Next, we focus on the two coordinates, which are the distances from the center of imidazole ring on H193 to the
center of phenol ring on CRO (R4) and to the center (X) between the carbon on CH group and 4-th carbon on
imidazole ring (R5), as shown in Figure 3(b). The distributions of R4 and R5 are shown in Figure 5(a) (b), where R4
in the neutral cis form tends to be shorter than that in the anionic cis form, while R5 in the neutral cis form tends to
be longer than that in the cis anionic form. These results show that, in the case of neutral cis form, the space for cistrans isomerization is opened at around the region near CRO by moving out of the imidazole ring on H193 from the
position below the phenol ring on CRO. Figure 6 shows the two-dimensional distributions of W and I dihedral angles,
defined in Figure 2, in the anionic cis (a) and the neutral cis (b) forms. The distribution along W is around 0 deg. in
the anionic cis form. Meanwhile, we notice that, in the neutral cis form, the distribution becomes broader having
negative values of both I and W dihedral angles at around -17 and -7 deg., respectively. This results means that the
structures of neutral form tend to be distributed in the region of the hula-twist (HT) process, compared with the
structures of the anionic form.

and the neutral cis (b) forms, respectively.

As the results of such different distributions between the anionic and the neutral forms in Figure 4, 5, and 6, the
thermally averaged snapshots for both forms are shown in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 5(a) (b), we found the
stacking between the phenol ring on CRO and imidazole ring on H193 in the anionic cis form, while it is broken in
neutral cis form. We have found that the space between H193 and CRO, as shown in Figure 7(b), is enough to
isomerization between cis and trans forms of CRO via HT rotational process. We can suggest that the protein
environment in neutral form has possibilities for CRO to isomerization between the cis and trans forms via HT
rotation.
3.2. CRO isomerization from the neutral cis to the neutral trans form with MD calculations
To elucidate the isomerization from the neutral cis to the neutral trans form, we performed the MD calculation for
the neutral trans structure that we substituted trans CRO for cis CRO of the neutral cis structure. Figure 8 shows the
representative snapshot for the neutral trans form. As shown in the neutral cis form, the stacking between the phenol
ring on CRO and imidazole ring on H193 are found and the hydrogen bonding between CRO and S142 does not
exist in the neutral trans form. In addition, a new hydrogen bonding network is formed between CRO and E144 and
between CRO and w242 in Figure 8. We notice here that our minimized neutral trans structure is very similar to the
2POX8 PDB structure.

We found the minimized anionic cis structure is 28.0 kcal/mol lower than the neutral trans structure. The energy
barriers from cis to trans forms are estimated as 112.0 and 75.0 kcal/mol via ST and HT rotations, respectively. The
energy barrier via HT rotation is 37.0 kcal/mol lower than that through ST rotation in the isomerization, because the
ST isomerization requires more space according to the larger conformational change than the HT isomerization.
3.3. Cis-trans isomerization with density functional theory
Next, we performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations with B3LYP functional. Table 1 shows the vertical
absorption energies of Bright and Dark states and their energy shifts for HBDI and whole Dronpa. Though the
absolute values of the absorption energies are not in agreement with the corresponding experimental values, our
energy shift of ONIOM calculation is 0.73 eV, which is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding
experimental value of 0.72 eV. Thus, we adapted B3LYP functional calculations for the qualitative discussion of the
Dronpa photoconversion.
To estimate the energy barriers for cis-trans isomerization via ST and HT rotations on S0 and S1 states in Dronpa,
at first, we performed DFT and TD-DFT calculations for the simple HBDI model. Table 2 shows the relative
energies of each form in S0 and S1 states, where the origin is set to the energy of the cis form in S0 state. The energy
barriers from cis to trans forms in S0 state are 29.5, 42.4, 36.6, and 40.8 kcal/mol for ST and HT isomerization
process in the anionic and the neutral forms, respectively, while those in S1 state are 6.1, 34.5, 14.0, and 28.3,
respectively. The energy barriers in S1 state are lower than those in S0 state in all processes, and the energy barriers
via ST processes are lower than those via the HT processes. We again address here that the isomerization via ST
rotation requires a big cavity around CRO region. There is, however, no space for CRO to ST isomerization in the
environment of whole Dronpa.
At the next step, we performed the ONIOM calculations. Table 3 shows the relative energies in the processes of
ST and HT rotations for the neutral form of CRO in S0 and S1 states. The energy barriers in S1 state are 28.8 and
14.0 kcal/mol via ST and HT rotations, while those in S0 state are 100.3 and 60.5 kcal/mol, respectively. We found
that the energy barriers via HT rotation are lower than those via ST rotation in the whole protein environment. The
result of ONIOM calculation is similar to that of MD calculation, where the energy barrier for the cis-trans
isomerization via HT process is lower than that via ST process. Our ONIOM result suggests that the energy barrier
for HT process in the S1 state is about a quarter of the barrier in the S0 state, though our S1 energy profiles were
evaluated with vertical excitation energies.

3.4. New proposed scheme of photoswitching for Dronpa

Energy

We propose a new scheme of the photoswitching on Dronpa based on our and previous results in Figure 9. In this
mechanism, the reversible photoswitching mechanism of Dronpa can explain with only three CRO states of the
neutral trans form (A state), the neutral cis form (I state), and the anionic cis form (B state).
Our MD results show that the B state is most stable structure, and the I state is metastable structure. From our
ONIOM results, the I state is more stable than the A state, and the energy barrier from the I to the A state in S1 state
is extremely lower than that in S0 state.

In the process of photobleaching, the ESPT from the anionic to the neutral forms of cis CRO occurs at the first
step. Then, the cis-trans isomerization can be induced by the HT rotation, and the state of Dronpa changes from S1 to
S0 states as the second step. After that, some species turn into either the A or I states. As coming to the I state, a
proton transfer from the neutral cis to the anionic cis form will be easily occurred in S0 state. In the photoactivation
of Dronpa, at the first step, the cis-trans isomerization of CRO occurs by HT rotation in S1 state, and the state of
Dronpa changes to S0 state. Then, the CRO changes to the B state via the I state. The reason why the A and the I
states via S1 are non-fluorescent process may be the existence of the conical intersection15 on CRO in the transition
from S1 to S0. The I state in our scheme can be corresponding to the D state in Miyawaki's scheme.
The cis-trans formation of CRO following ESPT is indispensable to explain the first step of the mechanism of the
photoactivation and photobleaching of Dronpa. Our scheme is very similar to that of the reversible photoswitching
mechanism of asFP595.24 Our results suggest that the contributions from the protein environment around CRO,
especially S142 and H193, are very important in the cis-trans isomerization process of Dronpa. The simulation of
whole Dronpa in S1 state with ONIOM method, including these residues as high-level layer, would be an interesting
subject to obtain the dynamical information for the photoconversion of Dronpa, and such study is now preparing in
our group.
4. Conclusions
We propose a new scheme of the photoactivation and the photobleaching for Dronpa with molecular dynamics
method and density functional theory. These processes can be explained by considering cis-trans isomerization in
neutral state. In photobleaching process, the excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) makes cis-trans isomerization of
the CRO possible via HT rotation process, since the space for cis-trans isomerization is opened at around the region
near CRO by moving out of the imidazole ring on H193 from the position below the phenol ring on CRO. The
contributions from the protein environment around CRO, especially S142 and H193, are indispensable for the
photobleaching and photoactivation process of Dronpa. Now, we are preparing the dynamics of whole Dronpa in
excited state with ONIOM treatment.
