Abstract
This paper proposed a new approach based on data mining to evaluate the eﬃciency of numerical asymptotic
models. Indeed, data mining has proved to be an eﬃcient tool of analysis in several domains. In this work, we ﬁrst
derive an asymptotic paraxial approximation to model ultrarelativistic particles. Then, we use data mining methods
that directly deal with numerical results of simulations, to understand what each order of the asymptotic expansion
brings to the simulation results. This new approach oﬀers the possibility to understand, on the numerical results
themselves, the precision level of a numercial asymptotic model.
Keywords: Data mining, asymptotic methods, paraxial approximation, Vlasov-Maxwell equations.

1. Introduction
Following (see [1]), this paper is to present a new approach based on data mining techniques to evaluate the eﬃciency
of numerical asymptotic models. Indeed, data mining techniques could help scientiﬁc computing, as they have proved
to be eﬃcient in other contexts, like in biology [3], medicine [6, 7], marketing [12], advertising and communications
[4, 5]. In this paper, we focus our presentation on an asymptotic paraxial approximation which models charged particle
beams. Indeed, solving the time-dependent Vlasov Maxwell equations, which is one of the most complete mathematical model for collisionless plasma or non-collisional beams, can lead to very expensive computations especially in a
three-dimensional domain. Therefore, whenever possible, it is worthwhile to take into account the particularities of
the physical problem to derive approximate asymptotic models leading to cheaper simulations.
However, despite some theoretical convergence results, it is not always easy to determine which terms to retain in
the asymptotic expansion to get a suﬃciently precise but not too expensive model. For instance in the case of the
paraxial approximation we consider here, despite convergence results proved in [8], a numerical study [2] shows that
the comparison of the diﬀerent orders of approximations is not obvious. In other terms, the asymptotic models are
often diﬃcult to compare directly one to the other. The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach, based on data

mining techniques, to answer to this question.
The paper is organized as follows. In a ﬁrst part, we expose an asymptotic paraxial model as an approximation of
the time-dependent Vlasov-Maxwell equations. Following [10], the model is derived by introducing a frame which
moves along the optical axis at the speed of light. Then, one considers a scaling of the equations which reﬂect the
characteristics of the high energy short beam. Finally, one introduces a small parameter, and asymptotic expansion
techniques are used to obtain a paraxial model. The simplicity of the so obtained formulation allows to use a ﬁnitediﬀerence discretization for the Maxwell equations and a particle approximation for the Vlasov equation, yielding an
accurate, but fast and easy to implement algorithm. In a second part, one uses data mining techniques to perform a
sensitivity analysis of this approximate paraxial model. Our method directly processes numerical results of simulations to understand what each order of the asymptotic expansion brings to the simulation results over what could be
obtained by other lower-order or less accurate means.

2. From Vlasov Maxwell to a paraxial model
Let us consider a beam of charged particles with a mass m and a charge q which moves in a perfectly conducting
cylindrical tube. We deﬁne the axis of the tube as the z-axis, which may be therefore chosen as the optical axis of
the beam. We denote by x=(x,y,z) the position of the particle, by p=(p x ,py ,pz ) its momentum and by v=(v x ,vy ,vz ) its
velocity. We assume that the beam is relativistic and noncollisional so that its distribution function f =f (x,p,t) in the
phase space (x,p) is solution to the Vlasov equation
∂f
+ v.∇ x f + F.∇ p f = 0,
∂t

where p = γmv, γ = (1 −

υ2 −1/2
)
, υ =| v | .

(1)

Above F = q(E + v × B) denotes the electromagnetic force acting on the particles, whereas the electric ﬁeld E=E(x,t)
and the magnetic ﬁeld B=B(x,t) satisfy Maxwell’s equations written in the vacuum. Our aim is now to explain how to
derive an approximate model. Basically, the general process can be decomposed into the following steps:
• Write the equations in the beam frame.
• Introduce a scaling of the equations, and deﬁne a small parameter which is well-adapted to the characteristics
of the problem.
• Use expansion techniques, retain the ﬁrst orders that will determine the precision of the model. Hence, you can
check the theoretical accuracy of the approximate model.
• Build an ad hoc discretization and test the resulting scheme with numerical results.
Here it is assumed that the beam is highly relativistic i.e., satisﬁes γ >> 1. Since vz c for any particle in the beam,
one rewrites the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in the so-called beam frame, i.e. in a frame which moves along z-axis
with the light velocity c. As a consequence, the particles are evolving slowly in that frame. One then exploits the
physical/geometrical properties of the problem to derive an approximate paraxial asymptotic model. In the case we
consider here, we assume that the dimensions of the beam are small compared to the longitudinal length of the device,
the longitudinal particle velocities vz are close to the light velocity c, and the transverse particle velocities |v⊥ | are
small compared to c.
If we denote by v the transverse characteristic velocity of the particles, one can introduce a small parameter η deﬁned
by
v
η=
1.
(2)
c
To derive the paraxial model, one ﬁrst develop asymptotic expansions in powers of the small parameter η for all the
quantities. Then, we replace formally in the Vlasov-Maxwell equations the functions by their asymptotic expansions.
Finally, we identify the coeﬃcients of the powers of η. Following this process, one can derive asymptotic paraxial
models with a given controlled accuracy. However, how many terms to retain in the asymptotic expansion to get a
suﬃciently precise but not too expensive model is not so obvious. This will be illustrate in the sequel.

2.1. The approximate models M1 and M2
We introduce the ﬁrst order (respectively: the second order) approximate model denoted M1 (respectively: M2 ),
obtained by retaining the ﬁrst order (respectively: second order) terms in the asymptotic expansion. For the sake
of simplicity, we assume now that the domain Ω is an axisymmetric three-dimensional bounded (in the transverse
direction) domain and we will use the cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z). One can show that the ith order asymptotic
expansion of f (here i = 1, 2) is entirely determined from the knowledge of the (i − 1)th order expansion of the
electromagnetic Lorentz force (Fr(i−1) , Fθ(i−1) , Fz(i−1) ). One thus obtain the following two models.
1. The model M1 :
In this model, the asymptotic expansion f (0) + η f (1) is entirely determined from the zero order expansion
(Fr(0) , Fθ(0) , Fz(0) ) of the electromagnetic force. To compute them, it is suﬃcient to know the principal part of
the transverse electromagnetic ﬁelds which satisﬁes:

Fθ(0) = 0 ,

(1)
Fz(0) = qv(1)
r Bθ .

(4)

Note that in this model, the longitudinal ﬁelds Ez(1) , B(1)
z are identically zero.
2. The model M2 :
We also consider the model M2 , in which the expansion f (0) + η f (1) + η2 f (2) is entirely determined from the ﬁrst
order expansion (Fr(1) , Fθ(1) , Fz(1) ) of the electromagnetic force. To characterize them, one readily obtain that the
transverse electromagnetic ﬁelds have to veriﬁed the same equations as (3) for the transverse ﬁelds, but at the
order 2, namely

(7)

In the next section, we perform a sensitivity analysis of these two models via data mining techniques. In such Vlasov
Maxwell simulations, one is often interested in the particle motion. For this reason, we will use the particle velocities
as characteristic variables in the data mining analysis. Following [2], we introduce for each model Mi , (i = 1, 2), the
variables

(i)
(i)

δv(i)
and δv(i)
r := γ|vr − vr,aver |
z := γ|vz − vz,aver |
for the radial and the longitudinal velocities, where the index aver denotes in each case the average velocity. Our aim
is to understand what the second order in the model M2 practically brings to the simulation results over what could
be obtained by the model M1 .

Let us ﬁrst illustrate our purpose with a numerical example. We have developed (see details in [2]) a discretization
method of this paraxial approximate model. For the ﬁelds equations, since the particles drift slowly in the direction
ζ > 0, the computational domain is reduced to a simple rectangular domain. Moreover, in this very simple but accurate
model, one has only to solve 2D transverse Poisson-like equations. Hence, a standard ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme can be
used. The Vlasov equation is numerically solved by means of a particle method. The distribution function f (x, p, t) is
approximated at any time t by a linear combination of delta distributions in the phase space
wk δ(x − xk (t))δ(p − pk (t)),

f (x, p, t) =

(8)

k

where each term of the sum can be identiﬁed with a macro-particle, characterized by its weight wk , its position xk and
its momemtum pk . This distribution function is solution to the Vlasov equation if and only if (xk , pk ) is solution to the
diﬀerential system:
dxk
= vk ,
dt

dpk
= F(xk , vk ) ,

(9)

together with initial conditions, which describes the time evolution of a particle k, submitted to the Lorentz force F.
The system (9) is numerically solved by an explicit time discretization algorithm.

On the left side on Figure 1 is represented δv(1)
r (top) and δvr (middle), whereas δvz (top) and δvz (middle) are
depicted on the right side. The results demonstrate clearly that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerences for δvr , between
the model M1 and M2 . On the contrary for δvz , the model M2 brings a signiﬁcant contribution to the simulation
compared to M1 . It is important to notice that these numerical results only correspond to a given time step we
extracted in something like hundred time steps of computation. So, to try to understand these features, not only on
a given time step, but rather than on all the available time steps, we propose in the next section to use data mining
explorations in the asymptotic model results.

r .

3. Data Mining Methodology
In the database we considered, the data are computed by the help of ﬁnite diﬀerences method and described numerical
approximations of problem (3-7) solutions. Then, at each time step and for each node of the concerned space grid, we

522

Franck Assous and Joel Chaskalovic / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 518–527

get a set of variables which are:
(i) (i)
(i)
(i)
(i) (i) (i)
(i−1)
, Fθ(i−1) , Fz(i−1) , δv(i)
v(i)
r , vθ , vζ , E r , E z , Bz , ρ , Jθ , F r
r ,

(i = 1, 2) .

(10)

Therefore, we organize the data such that each row of the database (or ”individual”, the devoted terminology in
database language) contains the information of the above variables for a given time step and space node. In the
simulation case we have run, the number of time steps Nt = 100, whereas the number of grid points Nr × Nζ was equal
to 1250.
Considering all the 100 time steps and the 1250 space nodes, the database we treated was composed by 125 000 rows
and 24 variables given by (10) to be analyzed.
Because our objectives are to appreciate the improvement of the results depending on the order of the asymptotic
development of problem (3-7) solutions, we introduce two variables as follows:
• Let us denote by X a given variable to be computed by the two asymptotic models M1 , M2 . We set X (1) its
evaluation from the model M1 and X (2) its corresponding value from the model M2 .
Then, the ﬁrst variable ω1,2 is deﬁned by:
ω1,2 =

X (1)
.
X (2)

(11)

It measures the weight of the model M1 in the model M2 , regarding the variable X.
More precisely, one has to consider ω1,2 in the two following main cases: The ﬁrst one is when ω1,2 is around
1 which corresponds to an equivalence of numerical results obtained between the two models M1 and M2 for
the calculation of X.
The second case describes the situation when the numerical results between M1 and M2 are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent. This case is available when ω1,2 is either very small or very great compared to 1.
)
• The second variable ω(3CLS
we introduce deﬁnes the ternary variable processed by binning the distribution of
1,2
ω1,2 into three equal classes of ω1,2 : Low, Medium and High.

Without any a priori on the meaning of Low or High contributions of the model M1 in the model M2 , it is usual to
)
as follows: the three classes of individuals are determined based on an equal
deﬁne the categorial variables ω(3CLS
1,2
count of rows for each modality of the ternary variable.
Then, because our objectives are to identify which variables could be predictors of a signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the
evaluation of the variable X between the two models M1 and M2 , we only keep in our analysis the extreme groups
)
.
deﬁned by the ”Low” class and the ”High” class of the categorial target variable to be explained, namely, ω(3CLS
1,2
Otherwise, the purpose of our analysis being to point out the role of the electromagnetic ﬁelds in the sensitivity between the models M1 and M2 , the dependent variables we kept to explain the above two classes are the non vanishing
electromagnetic components, the charge and current densities and the particles velocities computed by the model M2 ,
namely
(2) (2)
(2)
(2)
(2) (2) (2)
v(2)
r , vθ , vζ , E r , E z , Bz , ρ , Jζ .

As a complement to take into account the coupling with the Vlasov equation, we also kept the components of the
Lorentz force involved in the model M2 , that is
Fr(1) , Fθ(1) , Fz(1) .
Note that the other available variables could be considered in further developments.
4. Comparison between the model M1 and M2 regarding δv r
The question is to understand, at least in a formal way from the equations, what are the variables which bring a
signiﬁcant contribution from the model M1 to the model M2 , regarding the variable δvr .

4.1. The formal approach
In this study the general variable X deﬁned in section 3 is chosen equal to δvr . Then, ﬁrst of all, we plot the distribution
(2)
of ω1,2 deﬁned here by: ω1,2 = δv(1)
r / δvr .
(2)
As one can see (Fig. 2), this distribution is very gathered around the value 1 of δv(1)
r /δvr .

(2)
Figure 2: Distribution of δv(1)
r /δvr .

(2)
To understand this phenomena, we will formally analyze the relation between δv(1)
r and δvr with respect to all the
potential predictors. Then, we will conﬁrm by statistical and data mining tools the resulting features we will get.

We begin with writing Eq. (9) in axisymmetric geometry, one has

From these equations, one readily sees that the radial velocity vr , (that is equivalent2 here to pr ), basically depends on
the radial force Fr and on the square of the azimuthal velocity v2θ . Recall also the deﬁnition of δv(i)
r for each model
Mi , that is:
(i)
(i)
δv(i)
r := γ|(vr − vr,aver |,
where the index aver denotes the average velocity. Hence we can write in a formal way that the variable δv(i)
r is a
function ϕ of Fr(i−1) and (v2θ )(i) (the shift −1 of the superscript is due to the asymptotic expansion), that we denote by:
(i−1)
δv(i)
, (v2θ )(i) ),
r = ϕ(F r

(i = 1, 2) .

Let us use now the expressions of Fr(i−1) , for i = 1, 2. We have:

Anyway, if it not the case, one has to introduce δp(i)
r instead of δvr . Moreover, vr,aver as an average

2 In our case, the factor γm is quasi-constant.

524

Recall that each model Mi was derived by retaining the i ﬁrst terms in the asymptotic expansion of the distribution
function, the electromagnetic ﬁelds and forces, with respect to the small parameter η. As a consequence, one can
consider that

denotes the diﬀerence of evaluation for Bθ , (resp: vζ ), between the models M1 and M2 .

Substituting the above expressions into Fr(1) and retaining only the ”zero order” terms, one can approximate the force
Fr(1) by
(2)
Fr(1) Fr(0) + qv(2)

and we get that δv(2)

4.2. Data mining explorations by decision tree and validation by statistical test
The purpose of this subsection is to conﬁrm the formal result presented above by the help of data mining and statistical
tools.
To identify the role, if any, of the elements such that ω1,2 is signiﬁcantly far from 1, we will focus our analysis on the
)
. For this reason we eliminated the
individuals which belong to the Low class and the High class deﬁned by ω(3CLS
1,2
Medium group which will, on the other hand, gives to the future segmentation a better accuracy level.
First of all, let us consider the decision tree (see Fig. 3) we got under IBM SPSS Modeler [11] to model the two
)
classes of the ternary variable ω(3CLS
, says the ”Low” and the ”High” classes, in relation with the potential predictors
1,2
listed above. Recall that the exploration was processed on the whole available time steps and for all the space nodes
of the considered grid.
The precision of the decision tree [9] assessed by a contingency table gives the tree accuracy by the risk estimate which
is equal to 6.05 percents; it tells the chances of misclassiﬁcation by the decision tree. Here, for a binomial modeling
prediction, the risk describes the proportion of cases incorrectly classiﬁed by the tree. So, if the risk estimate is equal
to 6.05 percents, it means that 93.95 percents of data are correctly classiﬁed by the model of segmentation computed
by the decision tree. Therefore, the quality level of the decision tree is very high and its reading is as follows.
As one can see (Fig.3), the ﬁrst segmentation which appears on the decision tree shows the most discriminating
predictor variable in the set of all the available potential predictors. Hence, Ez(2) appears as this predictor with a
corresponding computed threshold equal to -0.006. This means that the group of the ”Low” ω1,2 is mainly diﬀerent
from the group of the ”High” ω1,2 , if one splits the whole involved population of the database up to the found threshold
of Ez(2) .

Figure 3: Decision Tree related to δvr .
)
Because of the meaning of the two classes of the variable ω(3CLS
we considered, a ﬁrst practical conclusion is that
1,2
the computation of δvr is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two models M1 and M2 , primarily due to the presence of
the variable Ez(2) in the asymptotic enriched model M2 . This result could be an expected one since the Ez component
is not present in the model M1 , we mean Ez(1) = 0.

On the other hand, at the ﬁrst level of the root of the decision tree a relevant tool of the decision tree is a whole
classiﬁcation of the predictors (see Table 1) from the most discriminant to the less one to distinguish the Low class
to the High one. As a consequence, in this list of predictors appears after the ﬁrst variable Ez(2) , the Er(2) component
which is signiﬁcant to explain the numerical diﬀerence of the asymptotic development computed by the model M2
versus M1 .

This feature is unexpected as a relevant splitting of the two groups since the corresponding component Er(1) is non zero
in the model M1 . Because of the strong nonlinearity of the partial diﬀerential system, this was not a result that could
be expected before this exploration.
Furthermore, and at the same stage of the decision tree, says the root, the classiﬁcation of the predictors also pointed
out that the variable B(2)
z does not appear as a predictor which explains a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two asymptotic modelings.
In contrast to the component Er(2) mentioned above, we recall here that B(1)
z was null in the model M1 . Nevertheless,
it does not bring a signiﬁcant contribution in the second order model M2 , while this might be intuitively expected.
After these ﬁrst conclusions, let us identify the nodes corresponding to the most homogeneous one relatively to the
)
Low and High classes deﬁned by ω(3CLS
. The exploration of the decision tree from the root to the end nodes, called
1,2
the leaves of the tree, shows the following results.
It appears (see Fig.3) that node 5 corresponds to the most homogenous regarding the ”Low class” and that node 10 is
the most characteristic of the ”High class”.
Therefore, these two groups are deﬁned as the most likely ones to characterize the ”individuals” in the database which
(1)
correspond, on the ﬁrst hand, to those such that δv(2)
r is signiﬁcantly greater than δvr , (we mean the ”Low class”),
(2)
and on the other hand, at the opposite, those such that δvr is signiﬁcantly less than δv(1)
r , (we mean the ”High class”).
We are now in position to describe these two groups by the help of standard statistical tools to highlight and to classify
the main features of these two groups.
To this end, we processed a statistical test to identify signiﬁcant diﬀerences for each predictor computed on the two
nodes 5 and 10, mentioned above.
The test we processed is the Mann-Whitney test which is a non parametric one which consequently does not assume
any hypothesis of normality for the variables to be tested.
As one can see, Table 2 leads that signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two clusters, (node 5 and node 10), are detected

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a new approach based on data mining techniques to evaluate numerical performances
of asymptotic models. We focused our study to the speciﬁc case of a paraxial approximation which models ultrarelativistic particles. Our aim was to determine the role of the diﬀerent powers in the asymptotic expansion, restricted
to the models M1 and M2 . As we have considered an approximate model of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, we have
chosen δv(i)
r , (i = 1, 2), as the main target variable.
The analysis of the decision tree shows that the most important predictor is Ez(2) . On the other hand, B(2)
z does not
bring any signiﬁcant contribution to distinguish the value of δvr between the two models M1 and M2 . The two most
homogeneous nodes in the decision tree allows us to conﬁrm why the distribution ω1,2 is gathered around one, as
(2)
suspected by the formal analysis. Namely, neither B(2)
z nor vθ does not play a signiﬁcant role for the computation of
δvr in the two models M1 and M2 .
Beyond the particular case we treated in this paper, we suggest that data mining techniques can be applied to the
analysis of any scientiﬁc computations as in a lot of other applications.
