Abstract
In the perspective of oil-importers, this paper considers an extension of the Value at Risk approach incorporated with timevarying conditional volatility model to trace the actual dynamic risk of regional oil-importing portfolio caused by the country risk
volatility. With an application to oil economies in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) region, empirical results show that the country
portfolio risk of oil-imports and country risk volatility in the FSU region has more significant influence on Chinaâ€™s oil-importing
risk than that on EUâ€™s.

1. Introduction
Former Soviet Union (FSU) region has emerged as an important international energy supplier besides the OPEC
countries. The rich oil and gas resources have attracted a large number of cooperation with oil-importing countries,
especially China and European Union (EU) countries who are trying to diversify their sourcing of crude oil imports
to reduce the dependence on the Middle East and to mitigate their oil-importing risk [1].
Regarding to evaluating the oil-importing risk quantitatively, Wu et al. (2007) [2] adopted the risk weight
coefficient of oil-exporting regions calculated through AHP approach in the perspective of Chinaâ€™s oil-importing
security. Gupta (2008) [3] assessed geopolitical oil market concentration risk of 26 net oil-importing countries by
adjusting the market shares for political risk ratings in the oil-exporting countries. In a related work, He et al. (2009)
[4] proposed an OICR Index incorporated with the country risk of 17 major oil-producing countries to evaluate the
oil-importing risk. Within these literatures, the risk weights of oil economies are static, and conducted by taking
some special risk as a proxy of the whole risk of a given oil economy, some even conducted on subjective judgment.

Thus, these methods above bring a practical problem: how to quantize the dynamic oil-importing risk brought by the
whole risk volatility of oil economies?
Much attention has been paid to techniques of modeling country risk and analyzing its properties [5, 6]. Recently,
Hoti et al. (2007) [7] adopted the MGARCH model to investigate the relationship of the country risk and the island
tourism economies. Li et al. (2009) [8] verified the dynamic correlations and spillover effects of country risk
between Russia and Kazakhstan using BEKK model. These empirical studies proved the applicability of the
GARCH models when applied to analyze the country risk, and indicated that it is more reasonable to consider the
risk interaction between countries when calculating country portfolio risk.
On the background of energy security, taking the FSU region as a whole, Sun et al. (2009) [9] identified the riskreturn spectrum of oil imports from the FSU region. Further, taking country risk into account, the primary purpose
of this paper is to trace the actual dynamic country portfolio risk of oil imports caused by the regional country risk
volatilities. With an application to the FSU region, a modified Value at Risk (VaR) approach incorporated with timevarying conditional volatility model is adopted. The plan of this paper is as follows. The econometric model is
described in Section 2. Section 3 analyzes the empirical results, and some concluding remarks and future work are
given in section 4.
2. Econometric model specification
According to UNcomtrade database (2008), for EU and China, oil imports in the FSU region almost come from
Russia and Kazakhstan. Thus, when we investigate the country risk portfolio, Russia and Kazakhstan are chosen to
be the proxy of FSU oil economies, and to be the component of the country portfolio of oil imports. In this paper,
we analyze the country risk of Russia, Kazakhstan using the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) ratings from
Dec. 1998 to Aug. 2008 considering the availability of the data. As country risk ratings can be treated as financial
indexes, country risk return series were generated using

crri ,t

100 u [log(cri ,t )  log(cri ,t 1 )], t 1, 2, , T ,

(1)

where, cri ,t , i (1, 2) is the country risk rating, and crri ,t , i (1, 2) is the logarithmic return of Russia and Kazakhstan.
Step 1Ë–Following Asai and McAleer (2008) [10], let the country risk returns on 2 financial assets be given by
crri ,t Pi ,t  H i ,t , i 1, 2 or crrt Pt  H t . The return of the country portfolio risk consisting of crr1,t , crr2,t , is denoted as
prrPi ,t Z ' crrt  Z ' H t , where Z (Z1 , Z2 )' denotes the portfolio weights, satisfying Z1  Z2 1 . Considering the ratio of
oil imports from Russia and the ratio from Kazakhstan, the country portfolios are conducted with weights
ZC (0.77,0.23)' for China and ZE (0.87,0.13)' for EU, denoted as prrCh ,t and prrEU ,t , respectively.
Step 2 Ë– Considering that modeling prrPi ,t as a simple univariate process may lose valuable information,
multivariate conditional volatility model in the framework of the Multivariate GARCH is used to estimate the
conditional covariance matrix of country risk returns of Russia and Kazakhstan. Firstly, VAR process is used to
filter country risk returns and the residual errors (H1 ,H 2 ) is obtained. Then, BEKK model of Engle and Kroner (1995)
[11] was proposed in order to reduce the computational burden of a Vech-Multivariate GARCH [12], and is given
by

where, H t [hij ,t ], i, j 1, 2 is the conditional covariance matrix of country risk returns, crr1,t and crr2,t . The BEKKGARCH (1, 1) model under a conditional normal distribution is chosen to estimate parameters, and the dynamic
VaR with normal distribution is calculated as:
VaRP ,t

Z ' ut  Z P , q Z12 h11,t  Z22 h22,t  2Z1 Z2 h12,t

(3)

1677

and denoted as nVaRP ,t .
Step 3Ë–The conventional VaR assumes that returns follow a normal or conditional normal distribution [13].
Considering the excess kurtosis and negative skewness of country risk returns, a modified VaR, which was provided
on the base of the Cornish-Fisher expansion [14, 15], is used to measure the dynamic risk of country portfolios,
prrCh ,t and prrEU ,t . Then, the modified VaR measure is calculated as follows:
VaRP ,t

where z Nq is q % confidence quantile of standard normal distribution, s is sample skewness, and k is sample
kurtosis.
3. Empirical results
In order to display the relationship visually, the conditional variances (shown as Ht in Fig. 1), displaying
significant volatility clustering, and the time-varying correlation coefficients are given by Rt Ut h12,t ( h11,t h22,t ) .
The correlation coefficients vary significantly over time ranging from -0.383 to 0.838 with the mean 0.318 and
median 0.309, mostly higher than the unconditional correlation coefficient 0.19. This suggests that Russia and
Kazakhstan are closely related in terms of the shocks to their country risks.

Based on the estimation of BEKK model, mVaR and nVaR values are calculated at 97.5%, 99% confidence level.
When the actual return is smaller than the VaR value, violations occur. If N violations in a sample of size T ,
G m / T is the ratio of violations. The basic test of VaR model accuracy is conducted by comparing the ratio of
violations at 1  D % confidence level with the significance level D % . For example, VaR calculated assuming a
95% confidence level should include 95% of observations, leading to violations of 5% of the time. The probability
of G , under the null hypothesis, is given by Pr( N ) CNT (GË†Ë†) N (1  G )T  N , where GË† is the desired ratio of violations.
Christoffersen (1998) [16] referred to this test as a test of Unconditional Coverage (UC) and used LR statistic for
testing whether G is equal to G . The LR statistic is given by:
LR

2[log(GË†Ë†N (1  G )T  N )  log(G N (1  G )T  N )]

(6)

and asymptotically distributed as F (1) under the null hypothesis of correct UC. According to the LR statistics of
back testing, the mVaR and nVaR values at 97.5%, 99% confidence level are accepted.

As shown in Fig. 2-4, whether at 99% or at 97.5% confidence level, nearly 65 percent of nVaR values for EU are
smaller than that for China, which means that with the assumption that the returns of country risk portfolio satisfy
normal distribution, risk of country portfolio for EU is mostly larger than that for China. In other words, in the face
of country risk volatility in the FSU, EU bears larger oil-importing risk. However, about 88 percent of mVaR for
China at 97.5% confidence level, and all at 99% confidence, are smaller than that for EU at corresponding
confidence level. Thus, it is concluded that when the more distributional characteristics (skewness and kurtosis) are
concerned, China faces larger oil-importing risk caused by country risk volatility in the FSU.
4. Conclusions
This paper considers an extension of the Value at Risk model incorporated with time-varying conditional
volatility model to trace the actual dynamic risk of regional oil-importing portfolio caused by the country risk
volatility, with an application to the FSU oil economies: Russia and Kazakhstan. Empirical results show that mVaR
is a better method to dynamically describe the country portfolio risk of oil-exporting countries in this region, and the
country portfolio risk has more significant influence on Chinaâ€™s oil-importing risk.
On a practical level, our future work in this area will focus on these questions: How will the country portfolio
VaR change, if other countries (such as Azerbaijan) are considered, or if some oil-related factors (such as oil price)
are introduced into the model? This type of risk analysis would be useful to evaluate the relative status of energy
security between different oil-importers in a strategic perspective, and be useful to identify the regional oil market
risk caused by the country risk volatility.
