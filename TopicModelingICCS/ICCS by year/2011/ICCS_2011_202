Abstract
For the past two decades, the combination between the boundary integral equation method (BIEM) and the finite difference
method (FDM) has provided a powerful approach for simulating the dynamic rupture process along a complex fault system and
the resultant seismic wave radiation and propagation for the purpose of understanding the physics of seismology and the
generation of strong ground motion by large earthquakes. In the many-core architecture currently in use, it can be useful to take
advantage of hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming. In this study, we are investigating the Mw6.6, 2007 Niigata Chuetsu-Oki,
Japan, earthquake. In the BIEM simulation of the dynamic rupture process, MPI-OpenMP hybrid programming is 24 to 38 %
faster than MPI programming on the same resource using 8 to 16 nodes (with 8 cores). In the FDM simulation on the wave
propagation, hybrid programming is 25 to 37 % faster. This performance allows us to investigate this earthquake using various
parameter settings. First we obtain the frictional parameters based on the proposed kinematic finite source model using BIEM,
then model both the spontaneous dynamic rupture propagation and wave radiation by combining BIEM and FDM. It is found that
on the given asperities, the peak stress can reach 20 MPa and reduced stress, -20 MPa. Dynamic rupture simulations require a
barrier around the southernmost asperity so that this asperity is ruptured in a reverse manner. This effect can be observed very
locally in the wave radiation. Furthermore, we observe that the dynamic rupture propagation between two cross-cutting segments
generates a more complex wavefield. The change in fault geometry may be dominant over the asperities on a single plane for this
earthquake.

1. Introduction
The earthquake process is described as elastodynamics. The particularity of the earthquake source includes a
discontinuous process (faulting) controlled by fracture mechanics, and this makes it difficult to simulate
numerically. For the purpose of simulating the seismic wave propagation, this faulting process can be represented as
double-couple forces at its origin. To dynamically simulate this faulting process with a given fracture criterion and
friction law, the stress and size of the discontinuity (slip or slip velocity) on the fault must be able to be estimated

with precision. In both cases, (semi-) analytical solutions are the best choice if they exist and are available, because
any numerical method presents limitations in its precision and resolution due to intrinsic frameworks. The boundary
Integral Equation Method (BIEM) in seismology is based mostly on the (semi-) analytical solution in the elastic
medium [1]. The applications are generally limited to infinite uniform media, semi-finite uniform media and/or
semi-finite layered media except when some special techniques are applied, but as much resolution and precision
can be obtained as needed anywhere. Still, the family of this method is powerful, as the Earth’s structure is firstly
approximated as horizontally homogeneous medium and heterogeneity is relatively minor at depths where most
earthquakes occur. The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is also a classic method for the differential equations,
among other volumetric methods. The limitation imposed by the usual structured grids is severe, but thanks to its
ease to handling, many seismological applications have been carried out. Both methods require considerable
numerical resources, as BIEM includes convolutions (multi-loops) and FDM needs volume (memory). These were
already advanced computations in the mid-1990s on the parallel machines [2, 3] and they continue to develop by
adapting to modern computing environments [4, 5, 6]. Recent advances in these environments allow us to perform
not only large-scale simulations but also iterative procedures such as Monte-Carlo-like parametric studies, multiscale simulations, evolutional simulations of seismicity and inverse problems. In this latter case, as in this study, the
model size is not that large, but high performance is required. Nowadays, the concerned problem should also be able
to be solved by other volumetric methods like spectral element and discontinuous Galerkin methods [7] without
separating the source faulting and wave propagation. However under the simple configuration as discussed in this
paper (blind fault at depth), the computing performance of BIEM-FDM in 3D is still good enough. Furthermore, it is
still difficult to treat precisely, stably and efficiently the dynamic discontinuity (faulting) in any volumetric methods,
especially in the case where the fault structure is geometrically complex including branching, kink and curving.
The object of this study is the 2007, Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki, Japan, earthquake (Mw6.6). Despite the dense
seismic monitoring network deployed in Japan, it is still hard to characterize this earthquake quantitatively because
the complexity of the 3D geological structure in this area masks earthquake source behaviors [8]. The spatiotemporal evolution of the finite source model is often too complex for engineering purposes, as too many parameters
(rakes, multi-time windows, etc.) are involved. The essential aspects of this earthquake from an engineering
standpoint have been summarized in several reports by Irikura and his colleagues [9], and these are actually applied
in the context of seismic risk evaluation, especially in the near-field, at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant
(see the working group reports on http://www.tepco.co.jp/nu/torikumi/material/niigata/index-j.html). Their source
model is a simplified one in terms of characterized source model [10]; it is illustrated in Fig. 1, assuming a rupture
velocity of 2.7 km/s. Although many alternatives (minor improvements in rake, rupture velocity, asperity area, fault
orientation and so on) have been proposed, the main features are:
• the existence of three asperities (Asperity 1, 2 and 3) along the fault strike, and
• the opposite direction of rupture directivity at the third asperity (Asperity 3).

asperities at which rupture initiates from star. The first of these also corresponds to the hypocenter. The fault surface is 24 × 13 km2 and the

moment magnitude is Mw = 6.6.

These features have been proposed mainly from the analysis carried out using an empirical Green function, and the
issues addressed in this study concern its dynamic rupture and wave radiation mechanics determined by means of
numerical simulations. From the point of view of application, i.e., quantitative seismic hazard analysis, it is
important to understand this earthquake, namely to be able to define a “reasonable” numerical model capable of
explaining the observations. We aim to ascertain what happened at the source of the earthquake (with a size
estimated at about 25 km) and the resultant ground motion at a regional scale (up to 100 km), and to do so we need
to test different scenarios and parameters. Therefore, this study does not call for very considerable computational
requirements, but rather moderate-scale computing that is efficient.
2. Numerical Methods and MPI-OpenMP Hybrid Computation

2.1. Boundary Integral Equation Method
We have chosen to use the boundary integral equation method in an infinite 3D homogeneous elastic medium [3].
This formulation is essentially designed to simulate spontaneous dynamic rupture propagation along complex fault
geometries in a 3D medium. This same method has been successfully applied for the 1992 Landers, California,
earthquake [12]. The formulation begins with the representation theorem of the elasto-dynamics, written
schematically as:





t





τ ij ( x , t ) =  dτ  d Σ Gij , p ( x , t ; ξ ,τ ) × ∆u p (ξ ,τ ) ,
−∞

(1)

Σ


where τ ij is the ij-component of the stress tensor and ∆u p is the fault discontinuity (p-component) on the fault

plane Σ . Equation (1) represents a spatial convolution over Σ for ξ , and a temporal convolution over τ from −∞
to the current time t. The function Gij , p is called the kernel and is a response function corresponding to the given
source for any receiver. Supposing an infinite homogeneous elastic medium, the expression for Gij , p can be
obtained analytically. Furthermore, when discretizing the fault element by a uniform slip rate within a time step, one
can easily write as a summation;



τ ij ( x , t ) = Instantaneous term ( ∆u p ( x , t ) ) + Convolution over past history ( ∆u p (ξ ,τ ) ) ,
(2)
 

where it is necessary to solve for τ ij ( x , t ) and ∆u ( x , t ) , denoting a time derivative by an overdot. When an
appropriate time step is chosen, these unknowns can be solved explicitly. If both are unknown, they can still be
solved by combining them with a given fracture criterion and friction law. Fig. 2 shows the basic schematic program
structure for the BIEM without algorithmic optimization. The computation in this case is then dominated by the
convolution part, i.e., the second term on the right-hand side in Eq. (2) and the loops for l, m, and n in Fig. 2. At
each time step, at each fault element, this convolution must be evaluated over the whole fault area and history up to
the present. The computation time is not proportional to the time steps.
2.2. The Finite Difference Method
Finite difference is a well established method in the field [13]. The motion equation in the continuous medium is
written:

ρ ui = τ ij , j + f i ,

(3)

1499

Hideo Aochi and Fabrice Dupros / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1496–1505
Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2011) 000–000

where ρ is the medium density, f i is the i-component of external force (if present), τ ij , j = ∂τ ij / ∂x j and the subindex takes on a summation rule. In most cases, seismology is characterized by a linear elastic medium, so that the
constitutive relation is:

τ ij = cijkl ε kl ≡ cijkl × (uk ,l + ul , k ) / 2 ,

(4)

where ε kl is the kl-component of the strain tensor and the elastic coefficient cijkl = λδ ij δ kl + µ (δ ik δ jl + δ il δ jk ) , where

δ ij is Kronecher’s delta function. For the descretization, we have adopted a widely used 4th order expression in
space based on staggered grids [10]. The spatial derivative at x is approximated by:

f ′( x) = (1/ h)(9 / 8{ f ( x + h / 2) − f ( x − h / 2)} − 1/ 24{ f ( x + 3h / 2) − f ( x − 3h / 2)}) ,

(5)

where h is the grid spacing. As clearly shown in this equation, one must have four neighboring elements in order to
calculate a variable at any grid point. This means that the communication is important, especially when dividing up
the physical domain for different nodes.

2.3. Execution Trials
Both methods are quite commonly used in parallel computing. The typical dimensions we have adopted in this

1500

study are 96 × 52 for BIEM and 570 × 620 × 310 for FDM. The former requires much less resource because the
model area is restricted precisely to the fault dimension of interest. They are typically parallelized using Message
Passing Interface (MPI), noting that this is required mainly by the many multi-loop operations for BIEM and by
memory limitations for FDM. We also note that MPI parallelization soon becomes less efficient in BIEM since the
modeled dimension is not large, and communication between adjacent domains in FDM requires that a physical subdomain should be large enough as compared to the communication part for the sake of efficiency. Therefore it is
worthwhile to test a hybrid MPI-OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) routine for both methods. For simplicity, we
parallelize only the outer loop by MPI and then provide the threads by OpenMP directives. The simulations are
carried out on the SGI Altix ICE 8200, JADE, cluster at the national computing center in France (CINES). Each
node includes 2 Intel Quad-Core E5472 processors. The Intel compiler is used for both Fortran and C in association
with the SGI MPI library (MPT). The performance described hereinafter is based on the elapsed time, which
includes all the processes of the calculation (initialization, input/output, and so on).
First we begin with the BIEM simulations. Considering the slip velocity history as known, we calculate the
spatial and temporal change in the stress field on the earthquake fault. The numerical performance tests are
summarized in Table 1. Although the element numbers are small, the performance of full MPI parallelization is
briefly scalable up to 128 processors using full MPI programming. We have not performed the computing with 256
processors using fully MPI programming, because due to the small number of elements, our code is not able to
parallelize the domain (it means until 96 processors for the given problem). Theoretically the computing time will
not be improved any more comparing to the case of 128 processors. By the way, in any case, the hybrid
parallelization yields a performance that is better by 24 to 38 % when the same computing resources are used.

seconds for a full MPI parallelization using 4 nodes x 8 cores (32 processors). The full MPI programming on 256 processors is not tested. The
number in italic is the estimation, as the performance is theoretically saturated.

Table 2 shows the execution trials using FDM. The MPI parallelization is not optimized in this version of the
code mainly due to the imbalance of charges between domains and the inefficiency of ratio domain/communication
[14]. This also results from the output writing, which occurs frequently in this experiment. The hybrid programming
results in a significant economy in run-time, up to 37 % and such improvements have already been noted [15]. As
the number of processors increases, so does the relative gain (unlike with BIEM), simply because the performance
of the full MPI parallelization is not enough good. Again, we have not performed using full MPI programming on
256 processors, as the domain is too small to divide in the given problem. It should be borne in mind, for example in
the case of 128 processors, that the hybrid programming results in a division into only 16 sub-domains, far more
efficient than the full MPI case (128 sub-domains).

substantially. For the problems dealt with in this study, the use of 128 processors (16 nodes) is useful and efficient
from a practical standpoint (execution less than one hour) for both methods.

3. The 2007 Niigata Chuetsu-Oki Earthquake

3.1. The Inferred Fault Constitutive Relation
We begin our discussion with the proposed kinematic model (Fig. 1). The BIEM can provide the constitutive
relation between the loaded stress and the movement along the fault during the rupture process for the given slip
history on the fault. We have adopted a slip function model [11], in line with what is commonly recommended [10].
The ratio of slip on the asperity and that elsewhere is 1.8, the rise time is 0.6 sec, the slip rake is set to 90° (pure
reverse faulting), the density of the medium is 2500 kg/m3, the P-wave velocity is 6000 m/s and the S-wave velocity
is 3464 m/s. Since the fault is buried in the bedrock at a depth of approximately 10 km, the BIEM in an infinite
homogeneous medium is well suited. Fig. 4 shows the change in stress field (slip-parallel and slip-perpendicular
shear stress on the fault) calculated with a grid size of 200 m and a time step of 0.0167sec, corresponding to the
trials in the previous section. The relation at the selected points is the so-called “slip-weakening” law, i.e., shear
stress decreases versus the fault slip, and this is characterized by a critical slip distance Dc of about 30 – 50 cm in
this case. On the asperities, stress drop and Dc are larger than elsewhere. It is also found that the change in the slipperpendicular direction is smaller, regardless of the sharp discontinuity in the nature of the fault. Note that there is
no normal stress change on the fault plane, because it is planar.
As the rupture initiation point on Asperity 3 is more distant, the stress evolution around this asperity is quite
unique. According to the behavior of shear stress change in the slip-parallel direction, we classify the fault area
according to four categories by observing the constitutive relation (Fig. 5). Most of the fault area displays “slipweakening”, as seen on Fig. 4. It is usual that the residual shear stress is lower than the initial value (Category 1) ,
but shear stress decreases due to the fault slip, but then sometimes it increases more than its initial value due to the
slip somewhere else (Category 2). Conversely, the area around the fault displays “slip-hardening” because of the
discontinuity at the edge of the asperity, namely stress rather increases with on-going slip (Category 4). We find an
area where stress tends to increase more than the criteria when the rupture initiated (Category 3) ahead of Asperity
3, which is necessary to the behavior of this asperity. According to physical interpretation, this area should be very
strongly “velocity-hardening” or simply a “barrier”. From simple averaging, the stress increased prior to slip
initiation and the so-called peak strength values, τ p , then obtained are 8.9, 17.9 and 20.4 MPa for Asperities 1, 2 and
3, respectively and 8.2 MPa elsewhere. The final stress levels then obtained are -16.5, -19.6 and -17.1 MPa for the
three asperities and -7.9 MPa elsewhere, in the slip weakening and positive stress drop zone (Category 1). The level
of stress change is rather large, since the rise time is assumed to be relatively very short.

Fig. 4. The stress change at the four given points on the fault plane (see Fig. 1). Two components of shear stress applied on the fault (slip-parallel
and slip-perpendicular directions) are illustrated with time shown at top. The given slip time function [11] is shown as well. The constitutive
relations are extracted between slip-parallel shear stress and fault slip or its rate (velocity) at the bottom.

Fig. 5. The characterization of stress change into four categories and typical constitutive relations are shown in the spots marked by triangles.
Category 1: slip-weakening and stress drop. Category 2: slip-weakening and stress increase. Category 3: slip-weakening and stress over-increase
(e.x. position = (7.1 km, 3.9 km)). Category 4: slip-hardening.

3.2. Forward Dynamic Rupture Modelling
According to the inferred constitutive relation, we determined the forward model setting. Supposing the initial
stress level is zero, we give a linear slip-weakening law between slip ∆u and slip-parallel shear stress τ as follows:

τ (∆u ) = τ r + ∆τ (1 − ∆u / Dc ) H (1 − ∆u / Dc )

(6)

where τ r is the residual stress level (= -8 MPa), ∆τ is the breakdown stress drop (= 16 MPa) and H is the
Heaviside function. Dc is taken as 30 cm. Peak strength is therefore τ p = τ r + ∆τ = 8 MPa. On the asperities, we
give ∆τ = 24 MPa and Dc = 50 cm instead. The stress change is moderate compared with the previous section,
expecting a moderate maximum slip velocity and a longer rise time. Fig. 6 shows three scenarios, simulated by
BIEM with Eq. (6), with ∆s =250 m and ∆t =0.0208 sec. The first, reference, case is a homogeneous fault case with
no asperities. The second introduces the three inferred asperities, simply varying the parameters mentioned above.
As the dynamic rupture passes on the asperities, the slip velocity is clearly seen to accelerate (cf. t=3.125 s on
Asperity 2 and t=5.208 s on Asperity 3). The rupture velocity also accelerates, but the directivity remains
unchanged. The third scenario entails adding some barriers, after several trials, around Asperity 3 so as to obtain a
rupture scenario similar to the first one given in Fig. 1. Asperity 3 does not ruptured until 7.291 s in Fig. 6, and then
the rupture propagates in reverse (cf. t=8.333 s).
3.3. Seismic Wave Radiation
We next are simulating the wave radiation from the simulated rupture scenarios using FDM with ∆s =200 m and
∆t =0.01 sec. Fig. 7 shows “snapshots” of the absolute amplitude of ground velocity on the free surface. The main
wave radiation (strong fringe toward the south) is accompanied by the rupture front. Then the strong wave radiation
starting from the southern edge of the fault plane is interpreted as the “stopping phase”. The local perturbation due
to the asperities is observed at t=8 sec (cases 2 and 3) and this may be propagated eastwards according to the local
directivity of the rupture propagation (case 3). For the sake of comparison, as inferred previously (Fig. 5(b) in [16]),
the wave radiation pattern from the cross-cutting faults – the north-western dipping northern segment and the southeastern dipping southern segment – is also shown (case 4). We do not aim to discuss the seismological detail in the
calculated ground motions in this paper. Although the frictional parameters are uniform in the dynamic rupture
simulation, this case 4 produces a more complex wave radiation. The wave radiation is observed to be far more
influenced by the fault geometry than the asperities on a single fault plane.

4. Discussion and Conclusion
Boundary integral equation and finite difference methods are used for simulating the 2007 Niigata Chuetsu-Oki
earthquake. Hybrid programming with MPI and OpenMP is tested for both methods and their performance is
confirmed by a gain of 24 to 38 % compared to full MPI programming. This result is encouraging for routine usage,
as the implementation is very simple. However, on the same machine with the same example (Table 1), we do also
find that the performance of the OpenMP threads saturates for four threads on a node (Table 3). Using eight threads
on node does not further improve the performance. Table 4 shows the comparison of the speedup obtained on Intel
Hapertown and on AMD Opteron eight-core architecture using our FDM code. The first configuration corresponds
to one computing node of the Jade cluster (GENCI-CINES). In the second case, the computations have been carried
out on a dual-core Opteron-2356 system. We only consider the finite differences kernel corresponding to the triple
nested loop and the evaluation of the velocity or the stress components. Several references underline the memorybound behavior of stencil computation [17]. The 4th order stencil used for the seismic computation falls into this
class of computation with a strong impact of the memory accesses and a high requirement for memory-bandwidth.
The Intel Hapertown architecture is well known to offer limited memory bandwidth and the OpenMP performances
are limited by the early saturation with 4 computing threads. The situation is a better with Opteron processor and the
HyperTransport interconnect. The speedup on 8 cores increases from 2.93 to 5.04. The increasing number of
computing cores and the emergence of non uniform memory access architecture may lead to much more complexity
in the performance even when using OpenMP programming model [18, 19].

For the Niigata Chuetsu-Oki earthquake, we have concentrated on the role of asperities. First we obtained the
constitutive relation between shear stress and fault slip. The stress change is found to be 9 to 20 MPa of peak stress,
and the final stress -17 to -20 MPa for asperities. Outside the asperities, these are about 8 MPa and -8 MPa,
respectively. Simulation results suggest the existence of a barrier around Asperity 3 to allow this asperity to rupture
in reverse with respect to the macroscopic rupture directivity. Whether this barrier is realistic or not is another
matter. Such barriers can be created by discontinuity in the fault geometry, which is not directly demonstrated in this
study. In actuality, some variations are present in the proposed models in which the fault plane at Asperity 3 is not
exactly the same as elsewhere [20]. The same authors also suggest that the directivity anomaly relative to Asperity 3
may be misleading due to the complex wave propagation in the region [20].
For the sake of comparison, we have added one additional scenario in which the rupture dynamically transfers
from one segment to another [16]. It is noted that such a drastic change in geometry can influence the wave radiation
more easily and significantly than any asperities on a single fault plane. This is an important point deserving further
study, as the source process of this earthquake remains a matter for debate. This paper aims to focus on the source
effect rather than the propagation path, but in fact, the complex 3D structure of this region can mask the actual
source process, and the model inferred from the assumption of 1D layered structure is not always valid in reality [8].
We believe that the HPC may help us to validate the 3D structure models and better calibrate the source parameters
