Abstract
This paper presents a comparative study on locally mass-conservative numerical methods for Darcy’s ﬂows. The
classical mixed ﬁnite element method (MFEM) is compared with the newly developed discontinuous ﬁnite volume
method (DFVM) with and without weak over-penalization (WOP). These numerical methods are tested on three
representative problems in porous media ﬂows. In particular, locality, accuracy of numerical solutions, computational
costs, and implementation issues are examined. The study indicates that the discontinuous ﬁnite volume methods
could be viable alternatives to the classical mixed ﬁnite element method for Darcy’s ﬂows.
Keywords: Darcy’s ﬂows, discontinuous ﬁnite volume methods, locally mass-conservative, mixed ﬁnite element
methods, weak over-penalization

1. Introduction
The Darcy’s law plays a fundamental role in porous media ﬂows [7, 10, 11, 20]. Numerical methods for the Darcy’s
law have to be locally mass-conservative to ensure correctness and usefulness of the obtained numerical velocities in
subsequent transport simulations [16]. The numerical experiments in [16] have demonstrated that violation of local
mass conservation results in severe overshoots and/or undershoots and loss of accuracy of concentrations in follow-up
transport simulations.
It is well known that the continuous Galerkin (CG) method is not locally mass-conservative. Postprocessing
techniques have been developed [9, 18] to compute locally conservative ﬂuxes from CG solutions. While these
techniques could be used to salvage the legacy codes developed in the early days, direct locally mass-conservative
numerical methods are preferred, since they shall oﬀer more convenience for practical computations.
The mixed ﬁnite element methods [5, 6, 14, 15], the node-centered ﬁnite volume methods (FVM), and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) ﬁnite element methods are all locally conservative by design. Recently the discontinuous
ﬁnite volume method [22], DFVM with weak over-penalization [13], and the enriched Galerkin (EG) method [16]
have been developed. These new methods are also locally conservative.

In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of these locally conservative numerical methods for Darcy’s ﬂows.
In particular, the mixed ﬁnite element method and the discontinuous ﬁnite volume method with and without overpenalization are tested on three representative ﬂow problems in porous media. Their locality, accuracy of numerical
solutions, computational costs, and implementation easiness are compared.

where Ω ⊂ Rd (d = 2, 3) is a bounded polygonal or polyhedral domain, p the unknown pressure, K a permeability
tensor that is uniformly symmetric positive-deﬁnite, f a source term, pD , uN are respectively Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary data, n the unit outward normal on Γ = ∂Ω, which has a nonoverlapping decomposition Γ = ΓD ∪ ΓN . It is
assumed that ΓD ∅, so that the problem has a unique solution. In numerical simulations, it is conventional to assume
that K is piecewise constant on a given mesh.
2. Locally Conservative Numerical Methods
In this section, we present three locally mass-conservative numerical methods for the Darcy’s equation (1): the
discontinuous ﬁnite volume method, the discontinuous ﬁnite volume method with weak over-penalization, and the
classical mixed ﬁnite element method. The features of the resulting discrete linear systems, condition numbers, and
error estimates of these methods will be brieﬂy discussed.
Throughout the paper, we adopt the conventional notations to use L2 (Ω) to denote the space of the Lebesgue
square integrable functions on Ω; H k (Ω)(k = 1, 2) denotes the subspace of L2 (Ω) functions whose weak derivatives up
to k-th order are also square integrable. Accordingly, · L2 (Ω) , · H 1 (Ω) , · H 2 (Ω) denote the norms in the corresponding
spaces.

2.1. Discontinuous Finite Volume Method
Let Th be a quasi-uniform conforming (no hanging nodes) triangular mesh on Ω and Th∗ be the dual partition
deﬁned in [22], see Figure 1. Let Eh denote the set of all edges, EhI the set of all interior edges, EhD the set of the edges
on ΓD , and EhN the set of the edges on ΓN .
We deﬁne respectively a ﬁnite dimensional space for the piecewise linear trial functions and a ﬁnite dimensional
space for the piecewise constant test functions as follows
Ph = {p ∈ L2 (Ω) : p|T ∈ P1 (T ), ∀T ∈ Th },

(2)

P∗h = {p ∈ L2 (Ω) : p|T ∗ ∈ P0 (T ∗ ), ∀T ∗ ∈ Th∗ }.
Then we deﬁne a connection operator from H (Ω) + Ph to

∀T ∗ ∈ Th∗ ,

∀e ∈ ∂T ∗ ∩ Eh .

(4)

Let e be an interior edge shared by two elements T 1 and T 2 and n1 and n2 be the unit normal vectors on e pointing
to the exterior of T 1 and T 2 respectively. We deﬁne the average {·} and jump [·] on e for a scalar q and a vector w
respectively as
1
{q} = (q|∂T1 + q|∂T2 ),
[q] = q|∂T1 n1 + q|∂T2 n2 ,

(5)

[w] = w|∂T1 · n1 + w|∂T2 · n2 .
{w} = (w|∂T1 + w|∂T2 ),

If e is an edge on the boundary ∂Ω, then we deﬁne
{q} = q,

[w] = w · n.

Our discontinuous ﬁnite volume method with degree-one polynomial shape functions (DfvmP1) can be formulated
as: Seek ph ∈ Ph such that
(7)

where

For DfvmP1, the global coeﬃcient matrix is symmetric if the permeability is a constant tensor on each element. Its
condition number is generally O(h−2 ) and also relies on the penalty factor. We refer to [19] for a detailed discussion
on this type of dependence.
After a numerical pressure ph is obtained by solving (7), a numerical velocity uh is then computed as follows [16]

2.2. Discontinuous Finite Volume Method with Weak Over-penalization
An interesting variant of DfvmP1 comes with the introduction of weak over-penalization and abandon of the
average/jump terms of the trial/test functions [13]. Our discontinuous ﬁnite volume method with linear shape functions
and weak over-penalization (DfvmP1WOP) reads as: Seek ph ∈ Ph so that
Ah (ph , qh ) = Fh (qh ),

∀qh ∈ Ph ,

(14)

where the bilinear and linear forms are deﬁned for any p, q ∈ Vh as

For DfvmP1WOP, the procedure for computing a numerical velocity based on a numerical pressure is the same as
that for DfvmP1. Error estimates similar to (11) have been established in [13].

A noticeable feature of DfvmP1WOP is its easiness in implementation. On each triangular element, one can choose
the three edge-midpoint-oriented Lagrangian linear polynomials as a set of local basis functions. The global coeﬃcient
matrix has a clear block structure. It is symmetric if the permeability tensor is a constant on each element. Its
condition number behaves like O(h−4 ). However, a simple block diagonal preconditioner can be constructed utilizing
the aforementioned basis functions [4]. In particular, the preconditioner contains the global mass matrix and a global
jump matrix [13]. The global jump matrix has respectively 2 × 2 or 1 × 1 blocks

for an interior or Dirichlet boundary edge with |e| being the edge length. Note that Neumann boundary edges don’t
contribute to the global jump matrix.
2.3. Mixed Finite Element Method
The Darcy’s law (1) can be rewritten as a system of ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equations about the pressure and
velocity as follows [6, 7]

Note that MfemRT0 has only ﬁrst order accuracy, since the shape functions are not complete degree-one polynomials. MfemRT1 does have ﬁrst order accuracy but involves partial quadratic polynomials. An advantage of MFEM is
that a numerical velocity is obtained directly without postprocessing like the other two methods, but more unknowns
have to be solved, as shown in Table 1. Another feature of MFEM is the saddle-point problem [2], which is more
diﬃcult to solve than the deﬁnite linear systems obtained from the other two methods.
However, we would like to point out that when the mixed ﬁnite element method is applied on rectangular grids, an
appropriate quadrature rule can be chosen to reduce the saddle problem to a symmetric positive deﬁnite cell-centered
ﬁnite volume formulation. Similarly, on general hexahedral grids, a quadrature rule can be chosen such that the
problem is equivalent to a multipoint ﬂux approximation method. In both cases, the number of degrees of freedom
can be reduced without sacriﬁcing accuracy, see [21] and the references therein.

3. Numerical Experiments
In this section, we conduct numerical experiments to compare these three locally conservative numerical methods
on three porous media ﬂow problems with diﬀerent permeability proﬁles. For all three test problems, we solve the
Darcy’s equation (1) on the unit square Ω = (0, 1)2 with the following boundary conditions
p = 1, left;

p = 0, right;

u · n = 0, elsewhere.

For simplicity of implementing DfvmP1, we set the penalty factor αe = 1 for all edges. In Figures 3, 4, 5, we plot
respectively a numerical velocity obtained from one of these three methods on a 40x40x2 triangular mesh, since the
diﬀerences to the numerical velocities obtained from the other two methods are indistinguishable. For better visual
eﬀects, we magnify all numerical velocities by a factor of two.

Example 1: A thin channel. In this test problem, a thin channel Ωc = [ 10
, 10 ] × [ 10
, 10 ] is contained in the
2
domain Ω = (0, 1) . The permeability is 0.1 on Ωc and 0.001 on Ω \ Ωc , see Figure 3. Clearly, the ﬂow runs faster
in the thin channel. No exact solution is known inside the domain for Example 1 (and Examples 2, 3), but the exact
solution values are known from the given Dirichlet boundary conditions on the left and right sides. The errors of the
numerical pressure at the nodes on these pieces of boundary can be measured and could be viewed as representative,
see Table 2.

Example 2: A poorly permeable region. In Example 2, the domain Ω = (0, 1)2 contains a central subdomain
Ωc = [ 83 , 58 ] × [ 14 , 34 ]. The permeability is a diagonal tensor K = KI2 with K being 10−3 on Ωc and 10−1 elsewhere, as
illustrated in Figure 4. It can be clearly observed that the ﬂow takes detour due to the low permeability in the central
region. Table 3 tabulates the condition numbers of the three locally conservative numerical methods on Example
2 with n × n × 2 triangular meshes. For DfvmP1WOP, the condition number growth is 4th order, due to the weak
over-penalization. The condition number growth rate of MfemRT0 is not so clear, since it is a saddle-point problem.

Example 3: Random permeability. We consider a heterogenous example on the unit square Ω = (0, 1)2 that was
tested in [16]. The permeability K = KE I2 , where I2 is the order 2 identity matrix and KE is a piecewise constant
deﬁned on a uniform 10 × 10 rectangular mesh. The value of KE on the rectangular blocks follows a log-normal
random distribution. In other words, log(KE ) has a mean 0 and a standard deviation 1, see Figure 5. In Figure 6, we
can observe the 1st order and 2nd order convergence of the discrete max norms of the errors of the numerical pressures
at the nodes on the left and right boundaries.

We list in Table 4 the iteration numbers of the unpreconditioned and preconditioned DfvmP1WOP. Here gmres is
used with restart 20 and tolerance 1E-9 [17]. These results show that the diagonal preconditioner in Subsection 2.2
does help reduce iteration numbers signiﬁcantly.
4. Concluding Remarks
It is clear from the comparison that both DfvmP1 and DfvmP1WOP produce numerical results comparable (higher
order accuracy in pressure but the same order accuracy in velocity) to that of MfemRT0 by solving for roughly the same
number of unknowns. However, the discrete linear systems generated by DfvmP1 and DfvmP1WOP are positive-deﬁnite
(and symmetric in most cases) and hence easier to solve than the saddle-point linear systems obtained from MfemRT0.
Among the two forms of the discontinuous ﬁnite volume method (without and with weak over-penalization), the latter
is easier to implement and has no need for choosing any penalty factors. Although its condition number is large, but a
simple block diagonal preconditioner is readily available [13]. We conclude that, for Darcy’s ﬂows, the discontinuous
ﬁnite volume method (both forms) could be a viable alternative to the classical mixed ﬁnite element method.
It should be pointed out that the errors in the above numerical experiments exhibit optimal convergence rates, but
the existing theoretical results [1, 8, 13, 22] assume higher regularity than it should be for applications like Darcy’s
ﬂows. Error analysis for the discontinuous ﬁnite volume methods with minimal regularity requirements is challenging
but currently under our investigation [12].
As is well known for porous media ﬂows, the Darcy’s law is tightly connected with transport problems. A numerical velocity obtained from any of the above three locally conservative methods can be used in a transport solver. Due
to the page limitation, we don’t address the coupling of the Darcy’s law and transport equations in this paper. The
interested reader is referred to [16] for a detailed discussion on this issue.
