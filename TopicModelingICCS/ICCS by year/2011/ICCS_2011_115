Abstract

Novel Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) have attracted a lot of attentions in adsorption and catalysis owing
to their superior properties to the traditional nanoporous materials. Grand canonical Monte Carlo combined with the
configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the adsorption isotherms of short linear alkane
mixtures in ZIF-8 and-10.It is found that adsorbed amount of alkane molecules increases with the pressure
increasing, the longer chain alkane molecules, the higher adsorption amount, and the adsorbed amounts of alkane
molecules in ZIF-10 are larger than that in ZIF-8. The selectivities of the ZIFs for different components were further
investigated and discussed, it is found that the selectivity of ZIF-10 is little higher than that of ZIF-8, but it is much
lower than other zeolites. The adsorption sites of alkane mixtures were also obtained by mCT images, the adsorption
mechanism of C1-C3 alkane mixtures in the ZIFs was analyzed, it may be helpful to design new ZIF materials with
good adsorption and separation capability.

Introduction
Microporous zeolite materials have been widely explored by experimental and theoretical techniques due to the
broad application in petrol chemical cracking, water purification and softening [1-2], and gas exchange and storage.[34]
since 1990. Lots of zeolites with different topologies and structures were used for adsorption and separation of
different mixtures.[5-6] In the recent years, the attention has turned to metal organic frameworks (MOFs),it seems to
be an attractive way of combining this structural diversity with embedded metallic functions. Recently, a novel class
of subfamily of MOFs, with structures similar to zeolites were synthesized, it is composed of tetrahedral cluster of
MN4 (M=Co, Cu, Zn, etc.)unites covalently linked by simple imidazolate ligands(IM). Given that the M-IM-M
angle is near145°, which is coincident with the Si-O-Si angle preferred and commonly found in many zeolites. [78]
Therefore, this kind porous crystalline material was named as Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs). It exhibits
the advantages of high adsorption capacity, tunable pore size, light weight, and chemical functionality of classical
MOFs, these characteristics combined with their high thermal and chemical stability and different structures similar

to zeolites, make ZIFs promising alternatives to zeolites and other nanoporous materials for adsorption, separation,
and catalysis.
It is well known that adsorption and separation behavior of alkane mixtures in microporous materials are of great
importance in the petroleum and petrochemical industries. To design adsorption processes needs a great deal of
adsorption and separation data. But it is time-consuming to obtain adsorption data by experiments alone, especially
for mixtures. Molecular simulation provides an attractive way to acquire adsorption data and explore the adsorption
mechanism at molecular level. In fact, many research groups have employed Monte Carlo ( MC ) and molecular
dynamic simulation (MD) to investigate the adsorption and diffusion mechanism of alkane mixtures in zeolites and
other microporous materials, such as MOFs.[9-13 ]For example, Lu et al[14] have discussed the adsorption and
separation C4-C7 alkane isomer in zeolites with different topologies by using configurational-bias Monte Carlo
technique, it was found that the selectivity of zeolites are closely related to their topologies. Düren and Snurr
investigated the adsorption behavior of CH4/n-C4H10 mixtures and the selectivity in different IRMOFs, the results
indicated that the selectivity for n-butane varied strongly with the MOF linker molecule, they have also proposed
some newly designed materials that show higher selectivity.[15]Besides, they also simulated multicomponent mixture
of C5-C7 in MOF-1, the result shows that MOFs are highly selective for separating alkane mixtures based on the
degree of branching in mixtures[13]. The adsorption of pure linear and branched alkane and their mixtures in
IRMOF-1 have been studied by Jiang et.al[11], it was found that competitive adsorption occurs in alkane mixtures as
a consequence of size and/or configurational differences between the components. In our previous works, we also
investigated the adsorption and separation of alkane isomer mixtures(C4-C6) in IRMOF-1 and -6, it is illustrated that
the longer alkane molecules, especially the branched molecules cannot be very close to the inorganic corner owing
to the stronger repulsive interaction and the space hindrance of IRMOF-6[16], which is consist with the viewpoint
proposed by smit [17], that is, the adsorption behavior of mixtures would be affected by size entropy effect
configurational entropy effects and length entropy in company with each other.[17]
Despite several experimental and simulation studies focused on adsorption and separation behavior of light gases
and alkane mixtures in zeolitesǃcarbon materials and MOFs in the past few years. There are almost no simulation
and experimental studies focusing on the adsorption of alkane mixtures in ZIFs, which are considered as the most
promising alternatives to zeolites. The adsorption mechanism of alkane mixtures in ZIFs is poorly understood, and
the relationship between the structure and adsorption is still lacking, which may provide useful information for
designing new ZIFs with good adsorption and separation capacity. In this work, the grand canonical Monte Carlo
(GCMC) in combination with the Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) technique was employed to
investigate the adsorption isotherm of short linear alkane mixtures in ZIF-8 and-10,which are consist of the same
ZnN4 unites linked by different simple imidazolate ligands with different topologies. The relative selectivities of
ZIFs were also explored to reveal the separation behavior of adsorbent. Besides, the Computer Tomography for
materials (mCT) technique was introduced to investigate the adsorption mechanism of alkane mixtures in ZIF-8 and
ZIF-10.

Models and Simulation details
In this paper, two typical ZIFs, ZIF-8 and ZIF-10 were constructed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data [18].
The Lennard-Jones potential was employed to describe the interactions between the adsorbed molecules and
frameworks of ZIFs as well as that between adsorbate. The adsorbate molecules were described with a united atom
(UA) force field, but the atomistic model was employed for ZIF frameworks. The potential parameters for alkane
molecules were taken from Vlugt et al[19].while for the MOF frameworks, the Dreiding force field was adopted[20].
The cut off radius was set to be 13.8 Å, and the cross interaction parameters between different units were calculated
from the Jorgensen mixing rules [21]
The simulation boxes are constructed by eight unite cell of ZIFs, The GCMC simulations were carried out at 298
K, 2×105 MC cycles were performed for alkane mixtures. 1×105 simulation steps were performed for equilibration,
and another 1×105 steps to sample the data. Molecular simulation calculated the absolute amount of the adsorbed
molecules, while the experimentally measured one is the excess amount of the adsorbed molecules. In order to
compare with the experiment data, the excess molecules, nex is calculated by equation:

nex

n abs  V g U g

where Vg is the pore volume of adsorbent, and ȡg represent the bulk gas density of adsorbed molecules, it is
calculated with the Peng-Robinson equation of state.

Results and Discussion
3.1

Comparison with the experimental

In our previous studies, we have investigated the adsorption isotherm of hydrogen and alkane mixtures in
IRMOFs by GCMC simulations [16, 22], it suggest that the simulation results agree well with the experimental data. In
order to further verify the model and the programs used in this work, the adsorption isotherms for pure hydrogen in
ZIF-8 at 77K was calculated for alternative and compared with Yaghi’s experimental data owing to the absence of
the experiment data for alkane molecules in ZIFs. From Fig 1, it is found that the simulation results are reasonably
agreement with the experimental data, which demonstrates the simulation model and the force field parameters used
in this work.

Adsorption isotherm

As we known, it is more convenient to simulate the adsorption isotherms of mixtures at various pressures
rather than that obtained by experiment. The adsorption isotherms of equimolar methane-ethane-propane ternary
mixtures in ZIF -8 were plotted in Fig 2, it can be observed that the longer chain component is preferentially
adsorbed at low pressure, when the pressure increases, the adsorption amount of propane reaches the maximal value
and then decreases. As to the shorter chain component, the adsorbed amounts start to increase at higher pressure,
then increase with pressure increasing. The adsorption isotherms of C1–C3 alkane mixtures in ZIF-10 were also
presented in Fig. 3, every component is adsorbed independently at different pressures. As the pressure increase, due
to the larger adsorption heat between the longest chain component and the frameworks of ZIFs, the propane first
increase to maximum then decrease. The longer chain alkane molecules seem to be squeezed out the pore channels
by relative shorter chain alkane at higher pressures.
As can be seen in Fig 2 and Fig 3, the adsorbed amounts of methane/ethane/propane in ZIF-10 are larger than
that in ZIF-8, which can be attributed to the lager pore channels of ZIF-10. The adsorbed amount of propane reaches
the maximal around 1000 KPa, while other components do not reach their peaks at this pressure, which suggests that
the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks may display good separation ability at this condition. Therefore, the separation
behavior of alkane mixtures discussed below would be investigated at this condition.

Separation behavior

As discussed in our previous study, the most interested and important factor is the selectivity of the nonporous
materials for different components. The relative selectivity ( D ) of adsorbent is determined by the ratio product of
mole fractions of components A to B in adsorption phase and in gas phase.
In this work, the relative selectivities of ZIF-8 and ZIF-10 for different mole fraction of mixtures were
calculated and shown in Fig. 4. The mole fraction of propaneǃethaneǃand methane in gas phase is fixed to 0.33,
respectively, and then the mole fraction of other two components varied correspondingly. The results show that all
the selectivity of ZIFs are greater than 1.0, it suggests that ZIFs can store more longer chain component, which can
be attributed to the stronger interaction between the longer chain component and ZIFs. As shown in Fig 4a, when
the molar fraction of propane fixed, the relative selectivity of ZIF-8 and ZIF-10 increase rapidly with the molar
fraction of methane in gas phase increase. Similar to that shown in Fig 4a, the relative selectivity of ZIFs for

1197

Li zhang, et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1193–1202

propane/methane system (xethane fixed to 0.33) also increase, its value is much larger than that shown in Fig 4a,
which can be explained from the adsorption isotherm. From Fig 2 and Fig 3, it can be observed that the adsorption
amount of propane have reach the maximum at the pressure of 1000Kpa, while the methane molecules have just
began to be adsorbed at that pressure. These results suggest that ZIF-8 and ZIF-10 could be considered as one of the
most potential separation material. As to the propane/ethane system, the selectivity change trend of ZIF-8 is similar
to that discussed above, it increases with the mole fraction increasing. Whenas the change trends of ZIF-10 is quite
different from ZIF-8, it decreases to the minimum than increases, which may be attributed to the competition of size
effect and entropy effect. In summary, the selectivity of ZIF-10 is little higher than that of ZIF-, but it is much
lower than other zeolite, it may caused by the relative larger pore channels of ZIFs.

Adsorption sites

It is well known that the adsorption and separation behavior of mixtures is closely influenced by the adsorption
mechanism. Therefore, with the aim of furtherly understanding the adsorption mechanism from molecular level, a
technique used in our preview work [22] named ‘Computer Tomography for materials’(mCT) was introduced to
investigate the adsorption sites of alkane mixtures in ZIF-8 and ZIF-10 at different pressures. In our previous
works[22], we have proven that the adsorption sites of hydrogen molecules in MOFs obtained by mCT technique is
well in agreement with that obtained by XRD and neutron powder diffraction. Recently, it is also employed to reveal
the hydrogen adsorption sites in ZIF-8 by zhou et. al,[24] and the results is also consistent with the neutron diffraction
experiment result published by Yildirim[23], which suggests that the mCT technique is an effective way to illustrate
adsorption mechanism of adsorbed molecules in ZIFs. It is very convenient to investigate the adsorption sites for
adsorbate in microporous from the mCT imagine. During the simulation process, the entire configuration of adsorbed
molecules were recorded every 1000 Monte Carlo steps, and then the density distribution of adsorbate was calculated
statistically on the basis of all of these configurations, finally the mCT images were obtain by compute imaging. From
mCT images, the redder, the higher densities of alkane molecules in this region, the stronger alkane adsorb ability of

the adsorption sites.
The mCT images of methaneǃethane and propane in ZIF-8 at low pressure(0.1Kpa) were calculated and
plotted in Figure 5, respectively, it can be easily found that there is nearly no methane molecules adsorbed in ZIF-8.
As shown in figure 2, the adsorption amount of ethane and propane at low pressure is just a few, therefore, the
adsorption sites of them can not be clearly observed from the mCT images. When the pressure increases to 100KPa,
more and more alkane molecules adsorbed in ZIF-8, the adsorption sites become more and more legible.(Figure.6) It
can be observed that the methane molecules was gradually adsorbed, most of them are preferential adsorbed around
the 2-methylimidazolate organic linkers of ZIF-8 and partial to the C=C bond, which is consistent with the
adsorption mechanism of hydrogen in ZIF-8 discussed by Yildirim through neutron diffraction. [23] However, the
alkane adsorption sits in ZIFs are greatly different from those in MOFs. In our previous work [22], we have revealed
that the predominant binding site of alkane isomer mixtures in IRMOFs are near the inorganic secondary building
units, then adsorbed around the organic linker. As to the alkane adsorbed in ZIFs, the primary adsorption site located

1199

Li zhang, et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1193–1202

around the organic linkers and close to C=C bond, which is contrary to that in MOFs, it can be attributed to the
steric effect of the methyl group of the organic linker of 2-methylimidazolate as proposed by Zhou et.al[24]. The
adsorption mechanism of ethane and propane molecules are similar to that of methane molecules shown in Figure 6a,
there is also some alkane molecules adsorbed around the ZnN4 cluster. When the pressure continue increases
to10000Kpa (Figure.7), the mCT images of alkane molecules were also similar to that shown in Figure 6, in other
words, alkane molecules still adsorbed around the preferential adsorption sites even the pressure as high as
10000Kpa.
It can be easily concluded that there is no competition of energy effect and size effect between these alkane
molecules by comparing the mCT images of methaneǃethaneǃpropane molecules in ZIF-8 at different pressure.
The adsorption behavior of all alkane molecules are controlled by the energy effect, which is quite different from
that in Cu-BTC discussed in our previous works[25], they indicated thatthere is a competition between the energy
effect and the size effect during the alkane mixtures adsorbed in Cu-BTC. This difference maybe attributed to the
different structure of microporous materials, nearly all the place of the spherical pore of ZIF-8 is equivalent to each
other, and all the C=C bonds of the 2-methylimidazolate face to the spherical pore of ZIF-8. Thus , due to the strong
interaction between adsorbed molecules and ZIF frameworks and the steric effect of the methyl group, all the alkane
molecules can be adsorbed in the spherical pore of ZIF-8 and closer to the C=C bond of 2-methylimidazolate

The adsorption sites of methaneǃethane and propane molecules in ZIF-10 at different pressure was also explored
and plotted in Figure 8-10, respectively. Form Figure 8, it can be observed that the density distribution of alkane
molecules is not so concentrated as that in ZIF-8, it may be caused by the relative larger pore of ZIF-10, some
alkane molecules are adsorbed dispersedly around the ZnN4 cluster. When the pressure increases to 100Kpa, all the
adsorbed alkane molecules are firstly preferential adsorbed in the four-ring aperture, then some other molecules
adsorbed around the metal-organic corner. The relative strong adsorption sites in the four-ring pore channel might
result form the coupling of four ZnN4 cluster that close to each other. Some ethane and propane molecules are also
adsorbed around the ZnN4 cluster of the eight-ring and formed a adsorption sites circle in the eight-ring aperture. As
shown in Figure 9b and 9c, the mCT images of ethane and propane is similar to each other. It is well known that the
adsorption heat for methane is smaller than that of ethane and propane, the adsorption amount of alkane mixture
increase with the pressure increasing, some methane molecules are gradually extruded from the four-ring pore
channel owing to their weaker interaction, that is, the adsorption behavior is mainly controlled by the energy effect.
As the pressure increase to 10000kPa (Figure10), more and more alkane molecules adsorbed around the ZnN4
cluster and the six-ring and eight-ring pore channels were also occupied, while the methane molecules are squeezed
out the four-ring channel completely by other short channel alkane molecules. In other words, ZIF-10 have a
distinguish effects for CH4, Whenas, ZIF-8 do not. it can be effectively employed to explain different selectivity
ZIF-10 and ZIF-8 discussed above.
Through the analysis of the adsorption sites at different pressures by mCT technique, it can be found that all the
alkane molecules are preferential adsorbed around the 2-methylimidazolate organic linkers of ZIF-8 and partial to
the C=C bond, there is no competition between energy effect and the size effect during the adsorption in ZIF-8. As
to ZIF-10, methaneǃethaneǃpropane molecules were firstly preferential adsorbed in the four-ring aperture, then
adsorbed around the ZnN4 cluster and the six-ring and eight-ring pore channel. As the pressure increases, the energy
effect is preferential to the size effect, methane is extruded from the four-ring pore owing to the relative weak
interaction, and the methane molecules mainly located around the imidazolate organic linkers of eight-ring pore
channel, the six-ring pore channel is also occupied, i.e the adsorption behavior of methane molecules is controlled
by energy effect.

adsorbed amounts of alkane molecules in ZIF-10 are larger than that in ZIF-8, and the adsorbed amount of alkane
molecules increases with pressure increasing, the longer chain alkane molecules, the higher adsorption amount. The

selectivity of the ZIFs for different components were further investigated and discussed, the selectivity of ZIF-10 is
little higher than that of ZIF-8, but it is much lower than other zeolite. The adsorption sites of alkane mixtures
obtained by mCT images, it can be found that all the alkane molecules are preferential adsorbed around the 2methylimidazolate organic linkers of ZIF-8 and partial to the C=C bond, there is no competition between energy
effect and the size effect during the adsorption in ZIF-8. As to ZIF-10, methaneǃethaneǃpropane molecules were
firstly preferential adsorbed in the four-ring aperture, then adsorbed around the ZnN4 cluster and the six-ring and
eight-ring pore channel. When the pressure increases, the energy effect is preferential to the size effect, methane is
extruded from the four-ring pore owing to the relative weak interaction, and the methane molecules mainly located
around the imidazolate organic linkers of eight -ring pore channel, the six-ring pore channel is also occupied, the
adsorption behavior of methane molecules is controlled by energy effect.
