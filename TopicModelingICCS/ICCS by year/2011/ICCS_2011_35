Abstract
Molecular Ornstein-Zernike self-consistent-ﬁeld method is applied to study the electronic properties of hydrated
electron. The electronic energies as well as the solvent water distributions are obtained for the ground and excited
states. In the ground state, the electronic energy is calculated to be −2.77 eV. The vertical excitation energy is 2.31 eV.
In the excited state, the electronic energy is lowered by 0.69 eV by the solvent relaxation and the energy gap between
the ﬁrst excited and ground states becomes 0.30 eV. The electronic properties and solvent distrubutions are discussed
by analyzing the radial distribution functions and the electron-solvent multipole interaction energies.
Keywords: MOZ-SCF, solvated electron, hydrated electron, excess electron

1. Introduction
Structures and spectroscopic properties of excess electrons in polar liquids have received considerable attention
both from experimental and theoretical points of view for long time[1, 2, 3]. In particular, the hydrated electron, i.e. an
electron trapped in the aqueous solvent, has been studied most extensively because it plays a central role in radiation
chemistry, photochemistry and many other ﬁelds of chemistry.
Since an excess electron interacts strongly with a large number of solvent water molecules in the system, a coupled quantum-classical model has been employed in many theoretical studies[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], where excess
electron is treated quantum mechanically while the surrounding water is regarded as a classical ﬂuid. Combining
the path integral representation for the excess electron with reference interaction site model (RISM) theory for the
solvent, Chandler et al.[4, 5] developed RISM-polaron theory and applied it to describe a localized state of electron
in water using a simple electron-water pseudopotential. This theory was also employed to examine the temperature
dependence of the stability of hydrated electron by Miura and Hirata[6]. A mean-ﬁeld theory of an excess electron in
polar solvent has been proposed by Zhu and Cuiker[7], where the wave function for excess electron is obtained from
the Schr¨odinger equation with the mean-ﬁeld potential originated from surrounding solvent. In this approach, the
electron density and solvent distributions are determined simultaneously. They used the mean spherical approximation (MSA) model integral equation theory to calculate the electron-solvent as well as the solvent-solvent correlation

functions. They showed that the repulsive short range part of electron-solvent potential is responsible for the localization of electron in solvent medium. Combined the MSA treatment for the solvent-solvent and electron-solvent
interaction with the polaron theory for the excess electron, Rips and Tachiya evaluated the solvent size eﬀects on the
equilibrium characteristics of solvated electron in a polar medium[8]. Since the hydrated electron is fully quantum
species, describing the electron-water interaction is not trivial. Turi et al. proposed the pseudopotential to describe the
electron-water interaction based on the static-exchange approximation.[12, 13] Another approach has been introduced
by Gordon and his coworkers[14, 15] to treat solvent eﬀects on chemical properties and reactions. They placed the
eﬀective potential on each water molecule, which was determined by ab initio electronic structure calculations for the
exchange/charge transfer interaction energy.
In this paper, we apply molecular Ornstein-Zernike self-consistent-ﬁeld (MOZ-SCF)[16, 17] approach to the hydrated electron. In MOZ-SCF theory, the orientation dependence of the electron-solvent interaction is correctly treated
through the rotational invariant expansions of the correlation functions as well as the interaction potential.[18]. Since
our approach is based on a molecular model of solvent, the short-range exchange repulsion and charge transfer interaction between solute and solvent at molecular level explicitly were considered by introducing an eﬀective potential
located on solvent molecule which is similar to Gordon’s eﬀective fragment potential approach. Although the previous approaches based on the integral equation theories for solvents are almost limited to the ground state properties
of hydrated electron, we examine here the electronic and solvent distributions for the ﬁrst excited state as well as the
ground state.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe MOZ-SCF theoretical approach to the
hydrated electron as well as the computational details. Section 3 shows the results of calculations. We compare
the properties of hydrated electron both in the ground and excited states with those of the previous theoretical and
simulation studies. Analyses of the radial distribution functions and electron-solvent interaction energies are also
performed. The concluding remarks are given in Section 4.
2. Theoretical method
Since the details of MOZ-SCF method have been presented in the previous paper[16, 17], we only describe the
outline of theory pertinent to the application to solvated electrons.
The total Helmholz free energy A of the system is given as the sum of the kinetic energy of solvated electron and
the excess chemical potential coming from the electron-solvent interaction,
1
A =< ψ | − ∇2 | ψ > +Δμ,
2

(1)

where ψ is the wave function of solvated electron and Δμ is the excess chemical potential which is the functional of
the electron-solvent total correlation function h(ω1 ω2 R12 ) and the direct correlation function c(ω1 ω2 R12 ) as well as
the electron-solvent interaction energy u(ω1 ω2 R12 ). Here ω1 and ω2 are the Euler angles deﬁning the orientations of
the electron coordinate and a solvent molecule, and R12 is the vector connecting the origin of the electron coordinate
and the center of mass of a water molecule, respectively. We assumed the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure to relate
the correlation functions and the interaction energy,
g(ω1 ω2 R12 ) = exp{−βu(ω1 ω2 R12 ) + h(ω1 ω2 R12 ) − c(ω1 ω2 R12 )},

(2)

where g, deﬁned by g = h + 1, is the radial distribution function and β = 1/kB T with kB and T being the Boltzmann
constant and temperature.
In MOZ-SCF approach, the correlation functions as well as the interaction potential are expanded in terms of the
basis set of rotational invariants;[18]

As shown in the previous paper[16, 17], the variation of A with respect to the correlation functions and electronic
wave function gives MOZ integral equation, the HNC relation and the solvated Fock equation. In the present case, the
wave function of solvated electron is determined by

Here ρ and uˆ are the solvent number density and the electron-water pair interaction potential, respectively. Note that
the coordinate system for the solvated electron is ﬁxed to be ω1 = 0 in eq. (6). The electron-water interaction potential
is given as the sum of the short range and long range parts,
vˆ (r) =

uˆ (r; ω1 ω2 R12 ) = uˆ short (r; ω1 ω2 R12 ) + uˆ long (r; ω1 ω2 R12 ).

Before performing MOZ-SCF calculations, the solvent pair correlation function was obtained by solving MOZ
equations for pure water with the HNC approximation. The temperature was 298 K with the density of 0.997 g cm−3 .
We used the same model for a water molecule as in the previous paper[16]; the dipole moment is 2.60 Debye, the
quadrupole moments are 2.63, -2.50 and -0.13 Buckingham, and the Lennard-Jones parameters are σ = 3.15 Å and
ε = 0.155 kcal/mol, respectively. The rotational invariant expansion was truncated at nmax = 3. The calculated
dielectric constant of 81.7 is in good agreement with the experimental value, 78.9. In order to carry out MOZ-SCF
calculations for the hydrated electron system, the electronic wave function is represented as a linear combination of
the basis functions. We used the (11s11p) Gaussian basis set whose exponents were determined by the even-tempered
rule;[21]
ζk = αβk
(k = 0, 1, ..),
(11)
where α was chosen to be 1.250 for the s functions and 0.3125 for the p functions, respectively, with β being 0.5.
Although we further added a basis function with a larger or smaller exponent, the results were essentially the same as
those by the (11s11p) basis set. In solving the electron-solvent MOZ-equation, the rotational invariance expansion for
the solute electron side was truncated at mmax = 4, and the matrix elements of the electron-water interaction potentials,
eqs. (8) and (10), were evaluated by the sixth-order numerical quadrature[16].
All the calculations were performed by the integrated solver for integral equation of molecular liquids, ISIEMoL.[16
17, 22, 23]
3. Results and discussion
Table 2 summarizes the results of the present MOZ-SCF calculations for a hydrated electron. The electronic
energy, ψ − 12 ∇2 + vˆ ψ , is calculated to be -2.78 eV for the ground state. The contribution from the kinetic and
electron-solvent interaction energy is 1.79 and -4.57 eV, respectively. The previous studies with various theoretical
models provided similar values for the kinetic energy. RISM-polaron theory[6] and the mean-ﬁeld approach[7] yielded
1.8 and 1.9 eV, respectively. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by Zhu and Cuiker (ZC)[7] also gave 1.9
eV, while the path integral MD by Schnitker and Rossky (SR)[9] estimated a slightly larger value of 2.2 eV. In
contrast to the kinetic energy component, the electron-solvent interaction energy largely depends on the method. For
example, RISM-polaron theory gave -6.1 eV for the interaction energy, which is about 30 % larger than the present
result. A slightly larger value, -5.4 eV, than the present one was also predicted by the mean-ﬁeld theory with the
MSA approximation, though the linearized approximation for the electron-solvent correlation function gave a smaller
energy of -3.6 eV. The MD simulation calculations with the ZC and SR models provided -4.3 and -5.2 eV, respectively.
As discussed above, the electron-solvent interaction energy is composed of the short range repulsive and long range
electrostatic terms in the present model. The contributions of these two terms are 0.62 and -5.20 eV, respectively.
It is noteworthy that the electron-solvent MOZ equation did not converge if we discarded the short range potential,
indicating that the exchange repulsion is responsible to localize the excess electron.
Figure 1 show the energy diagram of a hydrated electron. We ﬁnd a triply degenerated 2p state located at 2.31
eV above the ground state. The kinetic and potential energies for this state are calculated to be 3.20 and -3.66 eV,
respectively. Although the vertical excitation energy, 2.31 eV, from the ground state to the 2p state is larger than the

experimental estimate, 1.73 eV[24], the path integral MD simulations by Schnitker et al.[9] gave a similar excitation
energy, 2.4 eV, to the present one. Note that RISM-polaron value is 2.6 eV[6]. After the excitation to the 2p state, the
solvent distribution around the electron changes so as to be in equilibrium to the excited state electron distribution, and
the triple degeneracy at the vertically excited state is resolved. As seen in Fig. 1, the electronic energy of the occupied
2p state is lowered by 0.69 eV due to the solvent relaxation, while the unoccupied 2p state energy is raised by 0.60
eV. The adiabatic excitation energy is thus calculated to be 1.62 eV. The kinetic and interaction energy components
of the occupied 2p state energy are 1.82 and -2.95 eV. Compared to the vertically excited 2p state, the kinetic energy
is reduced by 1.38 eV, while the electron-solvent interaction becomes weak by 0.71 eV. Schwartz and Rossky[10]
carried out mixed quantum-classical MD simulation calculations to explore the relaxation mechanism of hydrated
electron. They found that the radiationless transition from the occupied excited state to the ground state occurs after
the solvent relxation takes place, and the average energy gap between these two electronic states is 0.4 eV. The energy
gap between the solvent relaxed states in Fig. 1 is 0.30 eV, which is consistent with the result by Schwartz and Rossky.
As seen in Table 1, the mean radius of electron distribution,
σe = {

drr2 | ψ(r) |2 }1/2 ,

(12)

for the ground state is calculated to be 2.21 Å, which agrees with those of MD simulations, 2.3[7] and 2.1 Å[9], as
well as the mean-ﬁeld theory, 2.2 Å[7]. The mean electron radius becomes larger, σe =2.7 Å, by the vertical excitation,
and increases to 3.6 Å by the solvent relaxation in the excited state. Note that the estimated σe for the vertical excited
state is about 3 Å by simulation calculations[9].
The radial distribution functions of the solvent relative to the center of mass of the electron are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig.2(a) represents the lowest order electron-solvent correlation function, g000

dent of the orientation angles, ω1 , ω2 and R
one at 6.1 Å, which are located at slightly longer distances compared with those by the simulation calculations.[11]
Integrating g000
00 (R12 ) to the ﬁrst minimum position, 4.5 Å, the coordination number for the ﬁrst solvation shell was
calculated to be 6.8, which is larger than the simulation results, 5 ∼ 6. It is noted that the coordination number is very
sensitive to the integration range. If we take the minimum of R212 g000
00 (R12 ), 4.2 Å, the coordination number becomes
4.9. In contrast to the ground state, there is no apparent peak in the excited state radial distribution function, and a

h011
00 (R12 ) is shown. Since this term corresponds to the interaction between the electron charge and the dipole moment
of a solvent water molecule, two distinct peaks for the ground state indicate that the solvent dipoles are strongly
oriented to the electron in this state. A low peak at 5.6 Å in the excited state correlation function means that the
charge-dipole interaction is weaker than the ground state.

In the ground state, the exchange repulsion energy, v000
00 , and the electron-solvent dipole term, v00 , are calculated to
be 0.42 and -4.62 eV, respectively. The electron-solvent quadrupole term also shows a non-negligible contribution
022

to the electron binding energy, v022
02 + v0−2 = -0.33 eV. In the adiabatic excited state, the lowest term v00 is larger
than that for the ground state, reﬂecting a broad distribution of the excited state electron. However, since the solvent
distribution around the electron is not spherically symmetric, the term v202
00 also contribute to the electron-solvent

exchange repulsion. As seen in Table 3, the sign of this term is negative and thus the exchange repulsion interaction
becomes 0.63 eV. Compared with the ground state, the electron-dipole and electron-quadrupole terms are smaller, i.e.

00 + v00 = -3.49 and v02 + v0−2 = -0.11 eV, respectively.
4. Conclusion
In the present work, we applied MOZ-SCF theory to a hydrated electron. The calculated ground state electronic
properties were comparable with those by the previous theoretical and simulation studies. The vertical excitation
energy was 2.31 eV. The adiabatic excited state, where the solvent distribution is relaxed so as to be in equilibrium to
the excited state electron distribution, was also obtained. The energy gap between the ground and ﬁrst excited states
was 0.32 eV, which is consistent with a simulation result. Although the excess electron is trapped in a solvent cavity
in the ground state, a solvent water molecule penetrates near the center of the electron in the excited state. Analyses
of the electron-solvent binding energies revealed that the electron-solvent dipole interaction is dominant in the ground
state though the electron-quarupole interaction has a non-negligible contribution. In the excited state, the exchange
repulsion is larger than the ground state and the electrostatic interaction becomes smaller.
Although we treated the equilibrium properties of hydrated electron in the present work, it will be possible to
extend the present MOZ-SCF approach to study the nonequilibrium solvation processes. It is well known that the
hydrated electron exhibits a wide absorption spectrum. The ﬂuctuation of electrin-solvent potential which is responsible to such a inhomogeneous broadning of spectrum may be derived from an integral equation theory for the
electron-solvent system[25, 26]. The nonequibrium solvent relaxation dynamics after the vertical excitation can be
also described with MOZ-SCF method under a linear response assumption[27]. Such a study is now in progress.
