Abstract
We consider a class of multi-armed bandit problems where the reward obtained by pulling an arm is drawn from
an exponential distribution whose parameter is unknown. A Bayesian model with independent gamma priors is used
to represent our beliefs and uncertainty about the exponential parameters. We derive a precise expression for the
marginal value of information in this problem, which allows us to create a new knowledge gradient (KG) policy for
making decisions. The policy is practical and easy to implement, making a case for value of information as a general
approach to optimal learning problems with many diﬀerent types of learning models.
Keywords: multi-armed bandit, knowledge gradient, optimal learning, exponential rewards

1. Introduction
The multi-armed bandit problem is a fundamental model in optimal learning, the study of eﬃcient information
collection. It is an example of a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem subject to environmental uncertainty, that
is, the decision-maker’s own uncertainty about key problem parameters. We have M independent reward processes
(known as “arms” or “alternatives”) with stationary, yet unknown means. At a particular point in time, we can
collect a reward from a single process of our choosing. The payoﬀ can be used to update a statistical estimate of
the mean reward of the process, thus providing us with information that can be used to make better decisions in the
future. Our goal is to maximize the expected total reward collected over a given (possibly inﬁnite) time horizon. The
environmental uncertainty inherent in the problem (our decisions depend on our statistical estimates, which may be
inaccurate) leads to the challenge of exploration vs. exploitation. We may wish to choose a process that does not have
the highest mean according to our model, simply to see whether our model is accurate.
In order to obtain practical decision-making strategies, it is often necessary to make additional assumptions on
the structure of the random rewards. For example, many studies [1, 2] make the assumption that the rewards follow
Bernoulli distributions with unknown success probabilities. This model can be motivated by the problem of clinical
trials, where an experimental drug can be either successful or unsuccessful in curing a disease. In problems where
the rewards are continuous, the Gaussian distribution can provide modeling ﬂexibility and computational advantages.

However, there are numerous areas of application where the payoﬀs are inherently positive, and thus make an uneasy
ﬁt for the Gaussian framework. Some examples include:
1. Network routing. We are submitting queries to DNS servers. Any server can resolve any query, but each server
has a diﬀerent, unknown expected latency. Our goal is to resolve all queries as quickly as possible, within a
ﬁnite, small time horizon (the total number of queries). The time cost of a query is always positive.
2. Multi-skill call centers. We are assigning calls arriving in series to technicians. The payoﬀ is the time needed
by a technician to resolve the issue. The objective is to minimize the total time needed to ﬁnish all jobs. The
total number of jobs can potentially be large.
3. Supply chain management. We have a choice of suppliers when contracting for a service or product. Our
expected inventory costs under each supplier depend on factors such as the supplier’s service reliability, which
can only be learned by doing business with the supplier for a period of time. Our goal is to ﬁnd the best supplier
while minimizing total inventory costs incurred over time.
The classical approach to bandit problems uses index policies to make decisions. For each arm, we ﬁrst compute
an index, which is a number that depends only on our beliefs about that particular arm, independently of what we
might believe about the other arms. We then choose the arm with the largest index. Thus, we decompose the problem
into M individual computations. The work by [3] showed that, if the reward processes are independent, then the
optimal decision-making strategy is an index policy, although computing the “Gittins indices” may be diﬃcult.
Index policies are especially powerful in the case of Gaussian rewards. In a Gaussian model, the Gittins index for
an arm can be written as a linear function of a “standard Gittins” index that does not depend on our estimate of the
mean reward [4], similar to how Gaussian noise can be viewed as a scaling of a standard Gaussian random variable.
Furthermore, Gittins indices are easier to approximate in the Gaussian case, via an analogy to continuous Gaussian
processes [5, 6, 7]. Other index policies for Gaussian rewards can be found in [8] and [9].
At the same time, there are fewer computable, practical index policies for the exponential model. Scaling properties are derived in [10], and [4] provides tables of Gittins indices for particular values of our statistical estimates, but
does not give numbers for every possible situation. The seminal work by [5] on approximating Gittins indices suggests
using the Gaussian approximation as a heuristic for non-Gaussian problems. One index policy derived speciﬁcally for
exponential rewards, based on the upper conﬁdence bound approach of [11], can be found in [12]. However, even this
policy relies on parameters that are diﬃcult to compute optimally [13]. Outside of this work, [14, 15] provide simple
heuristics, such as the ε-greedy and soft-max methods, that can be applied to general multi-stage learning problems.
Non-Gaussian distributions have appeared in the broader optimal learning literature. For example, [16] considers
a newsvendor problem where the demand follows an exponential distribution with an unknown parameter, whereas
[17] studies a dynamic pricing problem with an unknown Poisson arrival rate. While the optimization aspect of these
problems is more complex than for multi-armed bandits (e.g. maximizing a newsvendor payoﬀ), they contain a single
unknown parameter. This makes the problems somewhat more tractable, with [16] even ﬁnding a computable optimal
policy. Optimization in the bandit problem is relatively straightforward, but there are many unknown parameters.
In this paper, we use the knowledge gradient (KG) approach to derive a computable policy for bandit problems
with exponential rewards. KG is based on the idea of value of information, ﬁrst applied in optimal learning by
[18, 19] to ranking and selection, an oﬄine problem where we only estimate the highest mean reward, instead of
maximizing total reward collected over time. A more theoretical treatment can be found in [20], with extensions
pursued in [21, 22]. The KG method quantiﬁes the eﬀect of a single measurement on our estimate of the best reward.
Essentially, where index policies consider each arm separately, but over a long time horizon, the KG method considers
the evolution of our beliefs about all the arms, but only one time step into the future. This one step often carries a
great deal of information, although there are problems where the value of information is non-concave [23].
The KG approach has been applied to multi-armed bandits before [24, 25, 26], but thus far, only Gaussian
and Bernoulli models have been considered. However, in both of those settings, KG yielded computable, practical
decision-making strategies that performed robustly [27] in experiments. We show that both advantages are retained
in the exponential model: we obtain a closed-form expression for the value of information in this setting, and we
show that it outperforms other index policies and heuristics. We emphasize the way in which the general KG concept,
when applied speciﬁcally to the exponential problem, yields a computable strategy tailored to the problem structure,
suggesting that KG can serve as a general methodology for creating computable policies in many classes of optimal
learning problems.

2. Multi-armed bandits with exponential rewards
Suppose that the random payoﬀ of arm x, for x = 1, ..., M, follows an exponential distribution with parameter λ x .
This parameter is unknown, but we use a Bayesian prior distribution to represent our beliefs about it. We assume that
α0
λ x ∼ Gamma α0x , β0x , with α0x > 1 and β0x > 0. Thus, our initial estimate of λ x is IEλ x = β0x , our initial estimate
x

β0x
and our uncertainty about
α0x −1
β0x is very large relative to α0x ,

=
the accuracy of this estimate is encoded by the gamma
of the mean reward is
distribution. In particular, if
the variance of the gamma distribution will be small,
implying that we have a high degree of conﬁdence in our estimate.
We say that an event happens “at time n” if it occurs after we have made n decisions, but before we have made
the (n + 1)st. Denote by xn ∈ {1, ..., M} the (n + 1)st arm pulled. Then, we collect a reward Yˆ xn+1 ∼ Exp (λ x ), drawn
n+1
i.i.d. from the true underlying distribution. Our posterior distribution of belief at time n + 1 is Gamma αn+1
.
x , βx
The parameters of the gamma distribution evolve according to simple recursive equations [28]. The shape parameter
changes deterministically as follows:
IE λ1x

if xn = x
otherwise.

(1)

The updating equation for the scale parameter is
=
βn+1

βnx + Yˆ xn+1
βnx

if xn = x
otherwise.

(2)

Let αn = αn1 , ..., αnM and βn = βn1 , ..., βnM . The knowledge state sn = (αn , βn ) completely characterizes our beliefs
about all the alternatives at time n, and (1-2) describe the way in which our beliefs evolve over time as we make
decisions.
Our goal is to create a policy that will make decisions adaptively. Let N denote the time horizon, or the total
number of decisions we are allowed to make. We allow N to be inﬁnite. We deﬁne a policy π to be a sequence
π,n
(X π,n )∞
is a function mapping a knowledge state sn to an alternative
n=0 of decision rules, where each decision rule X
π,n n
X (s ) ∈ {1, ..., M}. Thus, by specifying a policy, we automatically lock in a way to make decisions in every possible
situation. Our objective is to ﬁnd the policy that achieves the biggest expected reward, or
max IEπ

,

for some discount factor 0 < γ ≤ 1. Here, IEπ is an expectation over the joint distribution of the true parameters λ x ,
and the random rewards Y n+1 received at each time step, given that all decisions are made according to the policy π.
3. The value of information and the knowledge gradient policy
Although we place our Bayesian priors on the unknown exponential parameters λ x , the average reward collected
from arm x is the reciprocal λ1x . Our estimate of this quantity at time n is the expectation over the prior distribution,
IEn λ1x =

βnx
αnx −1 .

Note that this is diﬀerent from the point estimate of
αn

βnx
αnx

that we would obtain if we were to assume that

λ x is equal to our estimate of βnxx . When we take our uncertainty about λ x into consideration, by taking an expectation
over the prior distribution, we reach a diﬀerent estimate.
Suppose that we choose alternative x at time n. The value of information obtained from this decision is deﬁned to
be the expected improvement in our beliefs about the largest possible reward,

If our beliefs were ﬁxed starting at time n, with no chance to learn any new information, we would choose the arm

. The right-hand side of (3) represents the amount by which this

1366

estimate improves between time n and time n + 1, as a result of our decision to choose x at time n. The expectation IEnx
is conditional given sn and xn = x. Because (3) is written as a diﬀerence, we refer to νKG,n
as the knowledge gradient or
x
the KG factor of alternative x at time n. In this section, we give a closed-form expression for the knowledge gradient,
and show how it can be used to create a simple and computationally eﬃcient policy for making decisions.

We see that the alternative arg maxy αny −1
is penalized by the KG calculation. It is possible for our estimate of a
particular reward to be so far ahead of other rewards that choosing the same alternative again will not change our
estimate of the best reward, regardless of the outcome of the random observation. Furthermore, even if an alternative
is ahead of the others, but still suﬃciently close to the second-best, we subtract a positive penalty term from its KG
factor. On the other hand, the information obtained by choosing an alternative that seems to be suboptimal is always
strictly positive; there is always a chance that we will be surprised by the outcome of our decision.
Figure 1 presents a numerical illustration of the KG formula as a function of C nx , for ﬁxed values of αnx and βnx .
βnx
The maximum is achieved at C nx = αnx −1
, that is, when the top two alternatives are tied. If this is not the case, the KG

βn

quantity declines more slowly as C nx > αnx −1
, suggesting that an alternative is favoured if it seems to be suboptimal.
If we are seeking to minimize costs incurred (as in our motivating applications), and not to maximize rewards
collected, we deﬁne the value of a single decision as

because improvement is now associated with reducing our estimate of the smallest cost. Letting C nx = miny x αny −1
and
n
repeating the calculations of Theorem 3.1, we will arrive at the same expression (5). However, since C x now refers to

1368

Ilya O. Ryzhov et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1363–1372
βn

y
the smallest estimate other than x, the formula now takes on a new meaning. The alternative arg maxy αny −1
will now
be the only alternative that does not receive a penalty. For other alternatives, if their cost is believed to be suﬃciently
high, choosing them will provide no useful information. Information about an apparently suboptimal alternative can
only be valuable if our beliefs about that alternative are suﬃciently close to the current best.
This behaviour is due to the asymmetry of the gamma and exponential distributions. The quantity αYnx can become
arbitrarily large, depending on the outcome of Y, but not arbitrarily small. Thus, our estimates of the mean rewards
tend to become larger. If we want the largest mean reward, this allows us to do more exploration, because measuring
the alternative that seems to be the best is less likely to change our beliefs about the argmax. However, if we want the
smallest mean cost, measuring the current best alternative will induce suﬃcient exploration by itself.

3.2. The knowledge gradient policy
Suppose that N < ∞ and γ = 1. The KG policy for multi-armed bandit problems, ﬁrst derived in [24, 26] for
Gaussian reward processes, makes decisions according to the rule
X KG,n (sn ) = arg max

βnx

(7)

βn

For each alternative, we consider the sum of its estimated reward αnx −1
and a value of information term, scaled by the
number of time periods remaining. Essentially, the KG policy assumes that the current decision at time n will be the
last to change our beliefs (that is, sn = sn+1 for all n ≥ n + 1). The value of the information obtained from this
. However, the information will also improve our ability to collect rewards in every
measurement is given by νKG,n
x
by a scaling factor representing the number of time periods remaining. If
time period after n + 1, so we multiply νKG,n

γ < 1, our expression in (7) becomes

X KG,n (sn ) = arg max

Lastly, if we are minimizing costs rather than maximizing rewards, the same argument used in [24, 26] can be repeated
to obtain a policy

To our knowledge, multi-armed bandit problems have rarely been considered in a minimization framework, perhaps
because there exists a symmetry between minimization and maximization if the rewards are Gaussian or Bernoulli.

the diﬀerence in average objective value collected. To reduce the variance of our performance measure, we compute
it using the true parameters λ rather than the actual observed rewards Yˆ n . However, this requires us to know the exact
values of λ. For this reason, we use a simulation study to validate our policies. We ﬁrst generated 100 problems, each
with a diﬀerent set of starting priors α0 , β0 . For each problem, we recorded the rewards collected by multiple policies
in 104 simulations. The value of λ x was generated independently from the prior Gamma α0x , β0x at the beginning of
each simulation, then ﬁxed for the duration of the time horizon. In order for our simulations to cover a wide range of

Ilya O. Ryzhov et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1363–1372

1369

values for the true parameters, we generated the prior parameters α0x and β0x from uniform distributions on the intervals
[2, 3] and [0, 1], respectively. Thus, our Bayesian modeling assumption holds in the experiments: the values λ x do
indeed come from the prior distributions.
For each problem (that is, each of the 100 sets of priors), we divided the full set 104 simulations into groups of
N
1
500 to obtain approximately normal estimates of the objective value IEπ n=1
λX π,n ( sn ) , then averaged over these groups
to obtain estimates of the mean values. Taking diﬀerences between these estimates for diﬀerent choices of π1 and π2
in turn yields estimates of (9).
We considered an inﬁnite-horizon setting with γ = 0.9 and γ = 0.99, and used the version of the KG policy given
in (8), with νKG,n
computed as in (5). We also tested several other policies, which are described below.

The quantities μn and σnx 2 represent the mean and variance of our beliefs about the mean rewards. The work by [5]
recommends using this approximation for the non-Gaussian case, based on a central limit argument. In our problem,
the mean reward of arm x is λ1x . Taking the mean and variance of this quantity with respect to the prior distribution of

It is important to note that this approximation is subject to an additional source of error in our experiments. In
addition to the error inherent in the approximation itself, we are also using the policy in a non-Gaussian setting. At
the same time, this approximation is very computationally eﬃcient, yielding a very fast decision rule. It can also be
applied to problems with arbitrary values of α0 and β0 , whereas the exact Gittins indices computed for the exponential
setting in [4] only cover a narrow selection of prior values.
Upper conﬁdence bounds (UCB). Most of the work on upper conﬁdence bound policies [11, 8, 9] focuses on either
Gaussian reward processes, or rewards with bounded support (e.g. Bernoulli). However, [12] proposes one UCB-type
method for the speciﬁc case of exponential rewards,

Bayes-greedy (Greedy). The Bayes-greedy policy is given by X Bayes,n (sn ) = arg max x αnx −1

“Bayes-greedy” to distinguish this policy, which maximizes an expectation of the mean reward of an arm over our
distribution of belief about that arm, from the “point-estimate” heuristic, which assumes that λ x is equal to its estimated

mean βnxx and thus chooses the arm given by arg max x αxnx . We found that the Bayes-greedy approach consistently
outperformed the point-estimate method, and so we do not report results for the point-estimate policy.
Table 1 reports the mean values of (9), averaged across 100 problems, with KG as π1 and the other policies as
π2 , with a discount factor of γ = 0.9. The last row of the table also gives the standard errors for these estimates. We
ﬁnd that KG signiﬁcantly outperforms the Gittins and epsilon-greedy methods, and narrowly outperforms UCB and
Bayes-greedy on average. However, although the mean diﬀerence in performance is not statistically signiﬁcant, we
can get more insight by looking at the empirical distribution of (9) across 100 problems, shown in Figure 2. The labels
show the total number of problems for which KG outperformed the competition, so “KG/UCB: 78/100” indicates that
KG outperformed the UCB method on 78/100 test problems. We see that KG outperforms both UCB and Bayesgreedy on a majority of problems, with a signiﬁcant positive tail, that is, a set of problems where the margin of victory
for KG is noticeably greater than the margin of loss when KG loses.
Table 2 reports the means and standard errors of (9) for γ = 0.99. Positive values for the means indicate that
KG outperformed the competing policy. In this setting, we ﬁnd that the UCB and Bayes-greedy policies become less
competitive, whereas the approximate Gittins policy improves considerably. In Figure 3, we see that this is the only
policy to ever outperform KG on our test problems. When the discount factor is high, the eﬀective time horizon is
longer; essentially, there are more time periods where we have a chance to collect rewards that are relatively large.
In that setting, a policy that does not look ahead at all (the greedy policy) is less eﬀective, whereas a policy that is
designed to look over an inﬁnite horizon (as the Gittins policy does) performs better. However, it is interesting to note
that KG performs competitively against all policies in both settings, which can be interpreted as a kind of robustness

of the KG approach.
Finally, Table 3 reports the average number (across 100 problems) of distinct alternatives measured by each policy.
Although each test problem has 100 alternatives, many of them are never measured by any policy. Instead, each
policy focuses on a subset of alternatives that seem to be good. The Gittins policy explores more than the KG policy,
which is consistent with the results reported in [24]. The diﬀerence is especially large for γ = 0.9, when the Gittins
approximation underperforms. When the discount factor is small, it is more important to make good decisions in the
early iterations than to explore the choice set, so a policy that does less exploration can be more eﬀective. When the
discount factor is large, the gap between KG and Gittins closes, although KG still performs competitively.
We conjecture that the Gittins approximation underperforms in the case where γ = 0.9 because the total discounted
rewards are less similar to Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, the policy of [7] seems to be subject to greater approximation error in the small-discount setting, as evidenced by the experiments in [26]. The development of eﬀective Gittins
index approximations, particularly in the case of non-Gaussian rewards, remains a matter for further study.
5. Conclusions
We have derived a knowledge gradient policy for a class of multi-armed bandit problems where the rewards are
assumed to be exponentially distributed with unknown parameters. Our policy can be computed using a closed-form
expression for the value of information, and does not require any tunable parameters. In addition to its computational
convenience, our experiments have shown that it performs competitively against other index policies in the exponential
setting. Some of the competing policies are eﬀective for smaller discount factors, while others can be eﬀective for
larger discount factors, but KG remains competitive against all of them in both settings. A theoretical analysis of the
long-run behaviour of the KG policy, whether in an oﬄine or online setting, remains a subject for future research.
Recent work on optimal learning has sought to break out of the conﬁnes of the classic bandit model, whether by
considering correlations between alternatives [21, 26], variable time horizons [30], or more sophisticated underlying
optimization models [31]. While we have considered a classic bandit model in this paper, we have shown how

the KG logic yields an eﬃcient computational algorithm for the case of exponential rewards, which has received
relatively little attention. It is our hope that this work will contribute to the idea that the value of information concept
underlying KG is a ﬂexible and broadly applicable methodology that can yield computable decision-making rules in
many problem classes.
