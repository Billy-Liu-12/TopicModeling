Abstract
The paper presents a grammar for anisotropic two-dimensional mesh adaptation in hp-adaptive Finite Element
Method with rectangular elements. It occurs that a straightforward approach to modeling this process via grammar
productions leads to potential deadlock in h-adaptation of the mesh. This fact is shown on a Petri net model of an
exemplary adaptation. Therefore auxiliary productions are added to the grammar in order to ensure that any sequence
of productions allowed by the grammar does not lead to a deadlock state. The fact that the enhanced grammar is
deadlock-free is proven via a corresponding Petri net model. The proof has been performed by means of reachability
graph construction and analysis. The paper is enhanced with numerical simulations of magnetolluric measurements
where the deadlock problem occured.
Keywords: anisotropic mesh adaptation, hp-adaptive ﬁnite element method, grammar, Petri net, deadlock

1. Introduction
In this paper we present a Petri nets based approach for testing and preventing deadlock during mesh transformations for two dimensional hp-adaptive Finite Element Method (hp-FEM) computations [1, 2]. The hp-adaptation
generates a sequence of meshes providing exponential convergence of the numerical error with respect to the number
of degrees of freedom. It has multiple applications including material science [3, 5, 4], propagation of electromagnetic
waves, in particular with oil-industry applications [6, 7, 8, 9] as well as heat transfer problems [5, 4].
The paper presents a grammar for anisotropic two-dimensional mesh adaptation in hp-adaptive Finite Element
Method with rectangular elements. h-adaptation of the mesh elements is governed by the following set of rules:
• element interiors and element edges are broken separately;
• an element edge may be broken for the N th time only when all its adjacent element interiors have been broken
for the N th time;

• an element interior may be broken for the (N + 1)th time only when all its adjacent element edges have been
broken for the N th time;
• an element may be broken either horizontally or vertically or in both directions as a single operation (we
consider anisotropic mesh reﬁnements)
The ﬁrst three rules follows from the fact that we enforce 1-irregularity rule [1] over the mesh, to prevent the
presence of double constrained nodes. According to the 1-irregularity rule a ﬁnite element can be broken only once
without breaking the adjacent large elements. The rule prevents unbroken element edges from being adjacent to more
than two ﬁnite elements on one side. When an unbroken edge is adjacent to one large ﬁnite element on one side and
two smaller ﬁnite elements on the other side, the approximation over these two smaller elements is constrained by the
approximation over the larger element. To avoid a technical nightmare with constrained approximation over multiple
constrained edges, the 1-irregularity rule is commonly used in the h adaptive algorithms.
The next section presents a grammar governing the process of h-adaptation such that all the above rules are
fulﬁlled. It occurs that straightforward translation of the above rules to grammar productions can lead to a deadlock in
a sequence of mesh element adaptations allowed by this grammar. This fact is shown by means of a Petri net modeling
the grammar-driven h-adaptation.
The subsequent section presents an enhancement to the deﬁned grammar. The new productions are added to
remove the deadlock by canceling one of the anisotropic reﬁnements and replacing it by the isotropic one.
The analysis of the Petri net modeling the h-adaptation governed by the enhanced grammar and its reachability
graph proves that the enhanced grammar is deadlock-free.
2. Grammar - straightforward approach
Productions of the ﬁrst version of the grammar are presented in Figure 1. Productions (BI), (BIH), (BIV) denote
breaking a mesh element interior in both directions, horizontally and vertically respectively. Production (BE) denotes
breaking a mesh element edge. We utilize here simpliﬁed graphic representation of element edges and interiors. For
full graph grammar description of mesh reﬁnements procedures we refer to [11, 12], while for the graph grammar
description of the solver algorithm we refer to [10, 13, 14].

Figure 1: Productions of the ﬁrst version of the grammar.

Let us consider adaptation of the exemplary mesh shown in Figure 2.
Petri net modeling the h-adaptation process of the exemplary mesh is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Petri net modeling h-adaptation driven by the ﬁrst version of the grammar.

Numbers in the transition names denote the corresponding mesh element to which a given production is applied.
For instance, transition BI1 corresponds to the execution of production (BI) on mesh element number 1. Likewise,
transition BE12 corresponds to the execution of productionn (BE) on the common edge of elements number 1 and 2.
A single letter X at the end of BEX transition name positions the element edge in relation to the corresponding element
interior. W stands for West, N for North, E - East and S - South. For instance, transition BE1N corresponds to the
execution of production (BE) on the northern edge of element number 1. The prim sign at the end of a transition name
indicates that ﬁring such transition models execution of a corresponding grammar production in the subsequent iteration of mesh adaptation. Any of the next iteration transitions being active means that the ﬁrst iteration of adaptation
has not ended with a deadlock. Such a Petri net precisely models all possible ﬂows of one iteration of h-adaptation of
the exemplary mesh. However, it is very complex in terms of the number of states it allows. Therefore a simpliﬁed
version of the Petri net, as presented in Figure 4, has been developed.
The sets of places and transitions have been limited to only such places and transitions that are relevant to deadlock
occurrence. Moreover, one auxiliary place and one auxiliary transition have been added to make the Petri net live if not
the inherent deadlock. From the application point of view, however, it would suﬃce to end the simulation (sequence of
ﬁred transitions) once any of transitions BE12, BE23, BE34, BE41 gets activated (meaning no deadlock has occurred).

Remark 1. The grammar is not deadlock-free.
It is clearly visible that the following sequence of ﬁred transitions: BIH1, BIV2, BIH3, BIV4 leads to a dead
state. In this state, all the internal edges are constrained and cannot be further broken without violating the mesh
1-irregularity rule.
3. Enhanced grammar
Figure 5 presents productions that have been added to the previously deﬁned grammar.

Figure 6 presents the Petri net modeling h-adaptation process of the exemplary mesh from Figure 2.
Similarly to the ﬁrst version of the grammar and the corresponding Petri net, also the enhanced version is too
complex for deadlock analysis. Therefore also this Petri net has been modiﬁed analogously to the previous one. The
simpliﬁed Petri net is presented in Figure 7.
Remark 2. The enhanced grammar is deadlock-free.
Reachability graph has been generated for given Petri net and given initial marking (shown in the ﬁgure). The
initial marking reﬂects the intention of braking each mesh element once. Subsequently it has been analyzed if there
exists any path in the reachability graph between the initial state and a dead state. There is no such path in the
reachability graph (the Petri net is live) what implies that the grammar modeled by the Petri net is deadlock-free.

4. Numerical example
We illustrate the deadlock problem by simulating a two-dimensional (2D) magnetotelluric (MT) problem. This
technique is used to determine a resistivity map of the Earth’s subsurface by performing electromagnetic (EM) measurements. The main diﬀerence of MT with respect to usual measurement acquisition scenarios is that MT uses
natural sources generated within the ionesphere, and it does not require artiﬁcial sources. Thus, acquisition of MT
measurements is rather inexpensive, and it is possible to cover large areas. Applications of MT measurements include
hydrocarbon (oil and gas) exploration and ﬁnding suitable regions for storage of CO2.
We employ a hp-adaptive ﬁnite element method for simulations of MT measurements [15]. We consider the
measurement acquisition scenario described in Figure 8, composed from a source modelled as a plane wave operating
at 100 Hz coming from the top part of the domain, a layer of air, a background earth material with resistivity equal
to 200Ωm, and three target zones with resistivities equal to 1000Ωm, 2000Ωm, and 50Ωm, respectively. This 2D
model problem is governed by Maxwell’s equations, and we incorporate a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) in order to
truncate the computational domain. Receivers are located along the air-earth interface. For simplicity, in this paper we
only consider one receiver position on top of the 2000Ωm resistivity layer. For that position, we employ the so-called
hp goal-oriented adaptive strategy [16], [17].
The version without ﬁxing the deadlock problem breaks down with just 6,245 unknowns, delivering an error
of 0.03%, while for reliable analysis of MT results 0.001% accuracy is needed. The ﬁnal mesh delivering 0.001%
accuracy is presented in Figure 10. The corresponding ﬁnal solution is presented in Figure 11. The solution obtained
on the mesh with accuracy 0.03% where the deadlock happened is presented in Figure 12. It is clear that the accuracy
is too low to estimate the properties of formation layers, since the solution over the part of domain representing the
air is dominating. Finally, Figures 13 and 14 present the mesh with the deadlock problem.

5. Conclusions
In this paper a grammar for anisotropic two-dimensional mesh adaptation in hp-adaptive Finite Element Method
with rectangular elements has been presented.
In the ﬁrst straightforward approach the h-adaptation rules are exactly translated to grammar productions. The
corresponding Petri net model shows that h-adaptation governed by such a grammar can enter a deadlock state.
Subsequently an enhanced grammar has been developed by adding two auxiliary productions to the original grammar. The analysis based on the generated reachability graph of the corresponding Petri net model has proven that the
enhanced grammar is deadlock-free.
