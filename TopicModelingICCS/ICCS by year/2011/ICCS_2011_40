Abstract
The structure of channels, cell material and operation parameters are usually implemented in diﬀerent ways from
anode to cathode in the actual work to seek better performance for polymer exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).
However, the asymmetrical structure of such speciﬁc design often leads to non-matching grids in the numerical simulation of PEMFC, especially when the structured grids are used. Besides, diﬀerent mesh sizes are often used in the
simulation for anode and cathode in order to obtain both high accuracy and relatively low computational cost. In this
paper, an overlapping domain decomposition ﬁnite element method is studied to deal with the non-matching grids for
a simpliﬁed two-dimensional single-phase PEMFC model. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods are
able to deal with PEMFC simulation on the non-matching grids with fast convergence and low mass balance error.
Keywords: PEMFC, non-matching grids, overlapping domain decomposition, numerical simulation

1. Introduction
Polymer exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been used in a large number of industries worldwide
because of their advantages such as low environmental impact, rapid start-up and high power density. Through
tremendous progress has been made in the past decade, industries are currently placing their focus on fuel cell design
and engineering for better performance, improved durability, cost reduction and better cold-start characteristics. This
new focus has led to an urgent need for identiﬁcation, understanding, prediction, control and optimization of various
transport and electrochemical processes that occur on disparate length scales in fuel cells [1, 2, 3, 4].
The performance of fuel cell is aﬀected by many factors, such as material parameters, operating conditions, diﬀerent channel structures and so on. Berning and Djilali [5] investigated the eﬀect of various operational parameters such
as the temperature and pressure on the fuel cell performance in detail. Combining the modeling with experiments, L.
Wang [6] studied the eﬀect of diﬀerent fuel cell operating temperatures, cathode and anode humidi1ities, operating
pressures and various combinations of these parameters on the performance of PEMFC. The various inﬂuences of the

straight, interdigitated and serpentine gas ﬂow channels have been studied in [7, 8, 9]. Shimpalee [10] investigated
how the serpentine ﬂow ﬁelds with diﬀerent channel sizes can aﬀect cell performance and species distributions for
both automotive and stationary conditions. Besides, a single-path serpentine ﬂow-ﬁeld design was used for studying
the eﬀect of channel dimensions, including diﬀerent channel width, land width and channel depth, on the hydrogen
consumption at the anode [11]. Cheng [12] found that the ﬂow channel size also aﬀects the reactant transport in a
PEMFC stack. Thus the size and shape of the channel play a key role in the design of PEMFC.
For better performance, therefore, diﬀerent structures for the anode and cathode gas channels are used in PEMFC
practical design. This asymmetrical structure can keep the balance of pressures on both sides of the membrane. Thus
the water management in cathode can be improved and the duration of fuel cell can be prolonged. However, the
asymmetrical structure often leads to non-matching grids in numerical simulations when partitioning with structured
grids such as hexahedra. That is to say, because diﬀerent grid generation methods are used in anode and cathode due
to the asymmetric structure, the grids on both sides of membrane are not matched, which produces great challenges in
numerical simulation. On the other hand, since oxygen reduction reaction occurs in cathode, the variation of physical
quantities such as water concentration are more signiﬁcant in cathode than in anode. For example, a possible cathode
ﬂooding may occur and show a gradual decrease in cell performance. Also, the increased water content of membrane
in equilibrium with liquid water in turn results in more water molecules being dragged electro-osmotically to the
cathode GDL thus leading to severe cathode ﬂooding. So it is necessary for cathode to simulate these phenomena
accurately by a reﬁned grid. On all accounts, a new discretization scheme is thus needed for an asymmetric PEMFC
structure with a non-matching grid.
Though an unstructured grid partitioned by tetrahedra or triangles can be used for this asymmetrical fuel cell in
one-domain approach, structured grids such as hexahedron and quadrilateral, not only easily implemented, but also
have super convergence [13, 14, 15]. So an overlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) is worthy of being
studied to deal with the non-matching structured grids arising from multiple asymmetric subdivisions. The objective
of this paper is to study a speciﬁc domain decomposition discretization scheme for a two-dimensional single-phase
transport model of PEMFC. To do so, we ﬁrstly introduce a 2D simpliﬁed steady-state transport model in this paper.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Governing equations for single-phase steady-state transport problem
are deﬁned in Section 2. In Section 3, we introduce the method of the combined ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume
and an overlapping domain decomposition method, then a new discretization scheme is designed to deal with the
non-matching grids. Numerical simulations of several practical cases are illustrated in Section 4, indicating that our
numerical schemes signiﬁcantly improve the computational performance in the senses of eﬃciency and accuracy in
contrast to an unstructured grid on the same asymmetric PEMFC.
2. The 2D steady-state transport model
Based on [1, 16], a fundamental fuel cell model consists of ﬁve principles of conservation: mass, momentum,
species, charge, and thermal energy. Typically the fuel cell is divided into seven subregions: the anode gas channel,
anode gas diﬀusion layer (GDL), anode catalyst layer (CL), ionomeric membrane, cathode gas channel, cathode
GDL, and cathode CL. In the following we speciﬁcally focus our interests on mass, momentum conservation and
water concentration arising in all seven subregions.
2.1. Governing equations
Flow equations. For ﬂow ﬁeld with velocity u and pressure P as unknowns, we have the following modiﬁed
Navier-Stokes equations [1]

where ε is porosity, namely, volume fraction of gases phase in porous region, ρ is density, μ is eﬀective viscosity. We
know (1) is an exact continuity equation, and (2) represents a modiﬁed momentum equation, in which we indicate that
the additional source term S u is named as Darcy’s drag and deﬁned as follows

The deﬁnition of K implies that gas channel is considered as completely permeable, while GDL and CL are presented
as porous media with small permeability.
Species concentration equation. Water management is critical to achieve high performance for PEMFC. Therefore, without loss of generality, in order to focus on water management topics, we typically consider water as the only
component in the following simpliﬁed species concentration equation. In this paper we only consider a single-phase
model for water concentration equation. The single-phase model described herein considers the total water amount
without distinguishing liquid water from water vapor. This approach is valid under the condition that liquid saturation within the GDL is low. This approach is particularly well suited for fuel cell simulations under low humidity
operation, a major application of single-phase models.
Water concentration equation in single gaseous phase is deﬁned as follows with respect to concentration C [1]
∇ · (uC) = ∇(Deg f f ∇C) + S H2 O ,

(5)

where Deg f f = ε1.5 Dgas is the eﬀective water vapor diﬀusivity, namely, the constant diﬀusivity in gaseous water region.

of transfer current density for our simpliﬁed single-phase PEMFC model due to the absence of proton and electron
potentials[17].

2.2. Computational domain and boundary conditions
The computational domain is schematically shown in Fig.1. The horizontal x-axis represents the ﬂow direction
and the vertical y-axis points in the through-plane direction. The geometric sizes of this computational domain are
marked in Fig. 1 as well.

Figure 1: Domain
At the inlet of the gas channel ( (∂Ω)1 , (∂Ω)2 in Fig. 1), ﬂow rate is deﬁned as a parabolic-like function, water
concentration are speciﬁed as a constant. At the outlet ( (∂Ω)3 , (∂Ω)4 in Fig. 1), both velocity and concentration ﬁelds
are assumed to be fully developed. Hence, based on this computational domain, the boundary conditions are indicated
as follows.
For ﬂow ﬁeld equation (1) and (2), the following boundary conditions hold with respect to velocity u = (u1 , u2 ):
u1 = u1 |inlet , u2 = 0 on (∂Ω)1 , (∂Ω)2 ,
(PI − μ∇u) · n = 0 on (∂Ω)3 , (∂Ω)4 ,
u1 = 0, u2 = 0

otherwise,

(8)
(9)
(10)

where u1 |inlet , deﬁned as a parabolic-like function, is given in (26). And u = 0, P = 0 in membrane because no ﬂow
ﬁeld exists there.
For water concentration (5), the following boundary conditions hold with respect to concentration C:
C = Cin on (∂Ω)1 , (∂Ω)2 ,
∂C
= 0 otherwise.

(12)

Governing equations (1), (2) and (5), together with the deﬁnitions of physical coeﬃcients and parameters in Table
1 and the boundary conditions above, constitute a simpliﬁed 2D steady-state single-phase transport model of polymer
exchange membrane fuel cell.
3. Numerical simulation methods
3.1. Domain decomposition
To study eﬀective numerical methods for non-matching grids arising from the simulation of PEMFC, ﬁrst of all, we
split the domain (Ω), shown in Fig.1, to two overlapping subdomains: one is the anode and membrane (Ωa ), another
is the cathode and membrane (Ωc ). The interface between anode CL and membrane is denoted as Γa , and the interface
between cathode CL and membrane is denoted as Γc . The classical overlapping Schwarz alternating method[18] is used
in these two subdomains. Thus we are able to reformulate equations (1), (2) and (5) to two Dirichlet-type interfacial
boundary value subproblems.

Since u = 0 in membrane, there is no degree of freedom in our numerical simulation for Problem A and Problem
C. The deﬁnitions of subproblems Problem A and Problem C imply that we need to solve these two subproblems
iteratively by a given initial guess u0a and u0c .

3.3. Discretization schemes
In correspondence with weak forms (17) and (18), we design the combined ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume
discretization schemes for the ﬂow equations (1) and (2), and apply the ﬁnite element method to the water concentration equation (5). Note that the convection term ( ερ2 ∇uk uk+1 , v) may dominant due to the large velocity u. Therefore, in
order to stabilize the numerical computation for nonlinear iteration (15), we employ the upwind ﬁnite volume method
to overcome the possibly dominant convection term [17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].
Since ﬁnite-diﬀerence based upwind scheme cannot directly work for ﬁnite element discretization, as substitutes,
streamline-diﬀusion scheme [17, 24, 25, 26, 27] is appropriately chosen to deal with dominant convectional coeﬃcients in the framework of ﬁnite element method. Typically, we apply streamline-diﬀusion scheme to concentration
equation (5), due to the speciﬁc convective features.
First we deﬁne a partition Thi with the maximum mesh size hi in Ωi (i, j represent a or c), and Σi, j is the set of
mesh points of Thi on Γ j . Let (·, ·)Ωi stand for the L2 inner product in Ωi .
To discretize weak form (17) and (18), we introduce the ﬁnite element space S hi = Vhi × Phi × Qhi ⊂ Vi × Pi × Qi
on Thi , where Vhi , Phi and Qhi are the piecewise bilinear ﬁnite element space. Especially for Qhi , we have
Qha := {w ∈ H 1 (Ωa ) | w|Γc = fa },
Qhc := {w ∈ H 1 (Ωc ) | w|Γa = fc },

(19)
(20)

where fa and fc represent the values of points in the sets of Σa,c and Σc,a , respectively, which are obtained by the
previous alternating step values of points Σc,c and Σa,a by lagrange interpolation.
For ﬂow equations, we introduce the following combined ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume schemes [23].

where the last term in the left hand side of (22) and (23) is a stabilizing term, derived from streamline-diﬀusion
scheme. Basically we hold δ sld (h) = C sld h, C sld is a certain constant parameter, which is chosen artiﬁcially with least
possible on the premise of optimal stability. Therefore, when mesh size h is suﬃciently small, the additional diﬀusive
terms eventually approximate to zero with the rate of convergence O(h). So numerical discretization (22) and (23)
still approache the original one when h is small enough [17].

3.4. Numerical algorithm
Now, we are in position to describe the overlapping domain decomposition algorithm with the ﬁnite element
discretizations (21)-(23).

(25)

which is the relative convergence error in two successive iteration steps on the interfaces of CLs and membrane.
If yes, then numerical computation is complete. Otherwise, go back to the step 2 and continue.
It is well known that the ﬂow proﬁle is parabolic under steady ﬂow conditions once laminar ﬂow is fully developed
in long and straight channel. Based on this fact, in the following numerical experiments, we assign the Dirichlet
boundary condition of velocity at the inlet as follows
u1 |inlet =

at cathode inlet (∂Ω)2
uin,c sin(yπ/δCH )
uin,a sin((y − 3.688 × 10−3 )π/δCH ) at anode inlet (∂Ω)1

0 ≤ y ≤ δCH ,

(26)

where 3.688×10−3 = δCH +δGDL +δCL +δmem . Since the Schwarz alternating method does not depend on the dimension
of the spatial domain but only the water concentration variable, we can directly generalize it to the three-dimensional
situation. Consequently numerical discretizations (21)-(23) are readily extendable to a three-dimensional PEMFC
model without any diﬃculty.
4. Numerical results
In this section, we will carry out the following two numerical experiments which indicate that our methods are
eﬀective to deal with the non-matching grids, see Fig.2 for example, in the simulation of the PEMFC.

Figure 2: An example of non-matching grids
Case 1: uin,a = 5 m/s, uin,c = 3 m/s, Cin,a = 12 mol/m3 , Cin,c = 4 mol/m3 . Provided that a practical boundary
condition uin = 5 m/s, Cin = 12 mol/m3 at the inlet of anode and uin = 3 m/s, Cin = 4 mol/m3 at the inlet of cathode,
we gain reasonable physical solutions by employing numerical discretization (21)-(23).
First of all, we deﬁne a rectangular partition Th on the domain with 10 intervals along x-direction for the length of
the anode, 30 intervals for that of the cathode and 40, 40, 16, 16 intervals along y-direction for the width of gas channel,
GDL, CL and membrane, respectively. So the number of total grids in anode and cathode are 10×(40+40+16+16) =
1120 and 30 × (40 + 40 + 16 + 16) = 3360, separately (mesh3 in Table 2). The tolerance of our stopping criteria (25)
for Schwarz alternating iteration is 10−20 . The Fig.3 displays the convergence history of water concentration with the
numbers of the iteration in our overlapping domain decomposition algorithm.
In order to verify the correctness of our numerical solutions, we compute the relative error of mass balance in
terms of the numerical ﬂuxes at the inlet and outlet.

shown in Table 2. We see that, at current mesh density (mesh3), an more accurate mass balance error is attained for the
gained numerical solutions. And our method with quadrangle grids have lower convergence error than unstructured
triangulation grids. Fig.4 displays the concentration of water in cathode on grid line where y = 35 mm for three
diﬀerent meshes in Table 2. We see that the concentration of water converges as the mesh size tends to zero. Water
vapor is generated in cathode catalyst layer by the reaction and gas diﬀusion is the dominant transport mechanism in
porous media. So the water concentration has a gradient change in the vertical direction.
In the following, the focus is placed on elucidating numerical results shown in Figs. 5-8.

Figure 6: Horizontal velocity with unstructured grids

The Fig.5 and Fig.7 show the velocity ﬁeld in anode and cathode of fuel cell produced by the overlapping domain
decomposition method. As expected, there is a large diﬀerence in the velocity scale between the porous media and
the open channel. The velocity in porous GDL is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the open gas
channel, indicating that gas diﬀusion is the dominant transport mechanism in porous GDL. Porous CL has a smaller
velocity than GDL due to the inferior diﬀusion ability. Fig.6 shows the horizontal velocity produced by unstructured
triangulation grids with the same number of nodes, from which we can see that the distribution of the velocity is not
smooth enough compared to Fig.5, indicating that an unstructured coarse grid cannot produce a comparably more

accurate solution than a structured grid with the same number of nodes. Note that a relatively coarse grid with better
numerical solutions is always promising in the simulation of a real-time problem.
Fig.8 displays the water concentration distribution, presenting in the phase of water vapor, in anode and cathode.
As shown in this ﬁgure, signiﬁcant variations are displayed in both anode and cathode; in the porous media there is
an increased water vapor concentration along the channel.

Case 2: uin,a = 20 m/s, uin,c = 3 m/s, Cin,a = 12 mol/m3 , Cin,c = 4 mol/m3 . In Case 1, a small diﬀerence
between the inlets of anode and cathode does not make visible diﬀerence for the vertical velocities. In this case,
we keep the same water concentration at the inlets of anode and cathode with Case 1, and let the velocity at the
inlet of anode increasing dramatically, which means that the diﬀerence between uin,a and uin,c is enlarged. Fig.9
shows the distribution of vertical velocity in anode and cathode. As the air ﬂows down the channel, the values of
vertical velocity is higher in anode than that in cathode. We also attain a relatively accurate mass balance error for the
numerical solutions in this case, as shown in Table 3.

5. Conclusions and future work
In this paper, a simpliﬁed single-phase 2D steady PEMFC model is introduced by a modiﬁed Navier-Stokes equations for mass and momentum, and a conservation equation for water concentration. Because there are some speciﬁc
structure designs for PEMFC requiring diﬀerent channel structures for anode and cathode, a structured quadrilateral
mesh on such PEMFC shall lead to a non-matching grid, where the grids are not matched in MEA. In the future work,
the relatively abundant water accumulation eﬀect at the cathode due to the coupling of two-phase transport in GDL
with other interdisciplinary issues such as oxygen reduction reaction and electro-osmotic drag also requires a more
precise simulation for water equation on a ﬁner grid at the cathode than that at the anode. Based on the combined

ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume methods and the overlapping domain decomposition method, a new discretization
scheme is designed and implemented for this speciﬁc PEMFC model. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our
methods are able to deal with the non-matching grids with fast convergence and obtain a relatively accurate numerical
solution with low mass balance error. The derived discretization scheme will be also studied for two-phase unsteady
and/or fuel cell stack model in our further work.
