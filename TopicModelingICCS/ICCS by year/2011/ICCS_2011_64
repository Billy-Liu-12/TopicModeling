Abstract
We introduce a reaction model combining with dissipative particle dynamics to study the chemical reactions in polymer
systems at mesoscopic level. In this model, we employ an idea of reaction probability to control the whole process of chemical
reactions. We apply this model on the study of surface initiated polymerization and the network structure of typical epoxy resin
systems. This method can be further modified to study different kinds of chemical reactions at mesoscopic scale.
Keywords: dissipative particle dynamics; reaction; polydispersity.

1. Introduction
As an effective simulation technique, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) had been successfully applied in
mesoscopic simulations for several years. Because DPD can cover large length and time scales and reproduce the
correct hydrodynamic behavior of fluids, it appears to be the most suitable tool to study the behavior of complex
fluids. In some cases, independent kinetic processes, e.g. chemical reactions, may accompany with the dynamic
behavior of complex fluids. A lot of experimental results showed that the reactions may greatly disturb the behavior
of diffusion [1]. Therefore, how to associate the hydrodynamic process of the fluids with the chemical reactions
becomes an important problem in the study of the complex fluids. Especially in polymeric systems, it is of great
significance how to simulate the reaction equilibrium at the mesoscopic level, since most of the dynamical problems
are generally related to the mesoscopic length and time scales. Moreover, designing the polymer chains with
controllable polydispersity and chain length distribution is a critical issue in polymer sciences. These problems
urgently demand computational models in which the chemical reactions can be taken into account. One of the
attempts on this issue was done by Lisal and the co-workers [2,3], who had proposed a reaction ensemble DPD
method to study the polydisperse polymer systems and supramolecular diblock copolymers. Their work shows that
DPD is an ideal method for simulating polymerization.
For typical free radical polymerization, the reaction is very fast as compared to the collective diffusion of
coarse-grained particles in DPD simulations. Thus the reaction turns to be a pure probability issue that judging
whether the polymerization can take place within one DPD time step or not. It implies that we may construct a
probability-based reaction model in DPD simulations. In this model, we employ a key idea of reaction probability

to control each time interval of chemical reactions. We demonstrate our model by applying it on the study of surface
initiated polymerization (SIP) and the network structure of typical epoxy resin systems. In the SIP model, by
tuning the initiator density and choosing different polymerization probabilities, we can obtain the polymer
brushes with different degrees of polydispersity and different chain length distributions. In the study of the network
structure in the typical epoxy resin system, we design a project to map from all-atom molecular model to the
mesoscopic model, from which we construct a chemically reasonable network structure with a high fractional
conversion comparable to experiments.

2.1. Dissipative particle dynamics
In DPD method, the time evolution of the interacting particles is governed by Newton's equations of motion [4].
Interparticle interactions are characterized by pairwise conservative, dissipative, and random forces acting on
particle i by particle j. They are given by:

2.2. Reaction model combined with DPD
In the construction of the reaction model coupled with DPD simulation, we will introduce the idea of reaction
probability to control each time interval in the reaction process. In each reaction time interval W , if an active end
meets several free monomers in the interaction radius, firstly it randomly chooses one of the monomers as a reacting
object. Subsequently, another random number P is generated, then by checking if it is smaller than the preset
reaction probability Pr , we decide whether the monomer will connect with the active end or not. This judging
process in one reaction step is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. If the bond can be formed between the active end
and the reacting object, we record the connection information and update the spring forces between them. In our
model, we assume that the different reaction probabilities correspond to different reaction rates of the systems
determined by different levels of reaction activation energies, as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the reaction process controlled by the reaction probability.

Fig. 2. Illustration of the supposed relationship between the reaction probability and the kinetic reaction activation energy.

This idea of reaction is especially suitable for the design of polymerization-type reactions. During the
polymerization, the newly connected monomers then turn to be the growth centers in the next propagation step of
the same chain to connect other free monomers, so that the active end is transferred forward. We have employed this
idea to construct several living polymerization models [7,8]. In our living polymerization models, the chain
termination step is omitted. It is easy to find that there is a specific relationship between the polymerization rate rp
and the reaction probability Pr ,

where [ M ] is the free monomer concentration, [ P*] the concentration of growth centers, and W the reaction time
interval. Thus, the model corresponds to the polymerization process with a constant reaction rate.

The reaction model is incorporated in our in-house developed parallel DPD code using message passing
interface. We perform the simulations in Dawning 500A and Inspur TS10000 multi-processor servers, and find that
both can provide high parallel efficiency.
3. Examples and Results
3.1 Surface initiated polymerization model
Polymer brushes are generally defined as layers of polymer chains end-grafted to a surface. They give rise to a
wide range of important technological and industrial applications, such as lubrications, oil recovery, colloid stability,
modification of surfaces, adhesion, reversible tuning of wetting, biotechnology, and contact formation [9-13]. In
experiments, it is important to understand the effects of polymerization rate on the properties of polymer brushes in
the SIP reactions. However, simulation studies of such systems scarcely covered on this issue. Regarding the effects
of polymerization rate (and most importantly, its interplay with the initiator density) on the properties of the polymer
brushes, we present a simulation study on the SIP process by utilizing the reaction model and taking into
consideration of the variation of polymerization rates in the simulations [8]. In this study, to highlight the excluded
volume effect in such systems, we adopt Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential [14] between interacting particles,
while retain the DPD thermostat. We construct the model with two layers of planar walls at the upper and bottom of
the simulation box, with some anchored active initiator sites regularly distributing on the surface of the bottom layer.
Then we apply the reaction model and the polymerization probability to control the brush chain growth process.
After a period of simulation, we can obtain the polydisperse polymer brushes with different morphologies and
grafting densities, see Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Snapshots of the surface-initiated polymerization with the initiator density Â³i = 0.226: (a) in the early stage of the polymerization; (b)
after a period of the SIP process. The densely packed purple balls represent the wall particles, the regularly distributed red balls represent the
initiators, the orange balls represent the grafted monomers, and the yellow balls represent the active ends of the chains. The free monomers are
omitted here for clarity.

In this study, we analyze the influence of both polymerization rate and initiator density on the grafting density,
the chain conformation, the fraction of unsaturated initiators and also the polydispersity index (PDI) of the brush
chains. For example, we investigate the influence of the initiator density on the graft density in our simulations. Fig.
4 shows the grafted monomer fraction, which is proportional to the graft density, with increasing initiator density at
different polymerization rates after the accomplishment of the reactions. At different polymerization rates, we find
that the relationship between the initiator density and the graft density is very similar to that reported in experiments
[15-17]. An initiator density window can be identified in the range of 0.353~0.508, after which each curve arrives at
a plateau, indicating a decrease of initiation efficiency. We also find the faster reaction yields the higher plateau
value. This is ascribed to that in the same period of polymerization, the faster reaction is able to graft more free
monomers. We also study the PDI of the grafted chains after the polymerization. Fig.5 shows the mean values of
PDI for each system with different initiator densities and polymerization rates. At the same initiator density, the
systems with faster polymerization possess larger PDI values. For a specific polymerization rate, PDI is higher in
the system with higher initiator density. Thus, if one needs to keep the polydispersity of high density brushes as low

Hong Liu et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1021â€“1028

1025

as possible, the surface polymerization rate should be kept as slow as possible. A relatively homogeneous growth
condition of the chains will benefit to low polydispersity.

Fig. 5.The PDI of the grafted polymer chains as a function of the initiator density at different polymerization rates in SIP reactions.

In this study, we find that the properties of the polymer brushes are greatly dependent on the coupling between
the initiator density and the polymerization rate. By tuning the initiator density and modifying the polymerization
rate, we can obtain the polymer brushes with different degrees of polydispersity. This study partially emphasizes the
importance of considering the effects of polymerization rate in further investigations [8].
3.2 Crosslinking reaction in epoxy resin systems
In common epoxy resin molecules, there are two or more epoxy groups which can react with the active
hydrogens in amines of the curing agents [18]. The product with network structures exhibits excellent mechanical

1026

properties, e.g., high static modulus, low creep and high-temperature performance, etc. As a result, it is widely
applied as coatings, composites, adhesives in aerospace and electronics industries. The investigations on how to
control the properties in these systems keep hot in recent years.
Suppose that the curing reaction is fast as compared to the sluggish diffusion of epoxy molecules, we then can
adopt the reaction model together with DPD to study the influences of controlling factors on the epoxy resin
network structures. The curing agent is chosen as 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), and the epoxy resin is
diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). Another epoxy resin is also included in this system as the sizing agent
which has the same repeat unit like DGEBA but a higher repeat number n=9 (n is the number of repeating units).
We firstly design the mapping project between the atomistic structures and the DPD coarse-grained particles. The
curing agent DDS is represented by one DPD particle, the DGEBA molecule is coarse-grained into N=2 oligomer
(N is the number of DPD particles of a molecule), whereas the sizing agent is coarse-grained into N=10 chain. We
then estimate the parameters in DPD simulations via the solubility parameters of each component. With this coarsegrained resin model, we can study the coupling process of diffusion and crosslinking reaction. In the crosslinking
reaction part, we still utilize our reaction model to control the connection between epoxy groups and amine groups.
Fig. 6 shows the snapshot of the network structure obtained by our simulations. It is clear that the crosslinking
points are knotting in the network structures, implying an enhanced mechanical property of the resulting material.

Fig. 6. Crosslinking network structure of the epoxy resin system. The orange stick represents the bond between the DGEBA particle and other
components. The purple stick represents the bond between the curing agent DDS and other components. While the blue stick represents the bond
between the sizing agent particle and other components.

By this reaction DPD model, we can construct a chemically reasonable network topology with a high fractional
conversion comparable to experiments in the epoxy resin system. In the simulations, the initial configuration is
constructed with two separated layers, in which the upper layer is the mixture of DGEBA and DDS, and the lower
layer is the pure sizing agent. Then the simulations without curing reactions are conducted for a period of time, so
that the molecules in these two layers can diffuse into the other layer and the functional groups can mix together.
Then the curing reactions are switched on and the formation of the network structure begins. Due to different
mobilities of the molecules at varying temperatures, the composition of the local network structure is different
(based on different gradient distribution of the components). It clearly manifests the competition between reaction
and diffusion. Fig. 7 shows the gradient distribution of the normalized density of crosslinking points and the left
epoxy groups along the z axis (the direction perpendicular to the surface) after the accomplishment of the curing
reactions, with a 4.5h105 time steps of the diffusion period without reactions in the beginning of the simulations. In

1027

the regions with higher crosslink densities (z/Lz=0.5~1), we find better mechanical properties; while in the regions
with higher epoxy group densities, we can observe the diffusion frontier of the primary amine groups in DDS (z/Lz â‰ˆ
0.1). It is also possible to further reversely map the coarse-grained beads into the all-atom network structure to
analyze the detailed mechanical properties with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.

reactions.

4. Conclusion
Here we introduce a reaction model combined with DPD to study the reaction of polymer systems at the
mesoscopic level. In our model, we employ a key idea of reaction probability to control the whole process of
chemical reactions. For illustrations, we apply our model on the study of SIP and the network structure in typical
epoxy resin systems. In the SIP model, by tuning the initiator density and choosing different polymerization
probabilities, we can obtain the polymer brushes with different degrees of polydispersity and different chain
length distributions. In the study of the network structure in the epoxy resin system, we firstly coarse-grain the allatom structure into a DPD-suitable system, then use our reaction model to simulate the coupling process of diffusion
and crosslinking reaction. By this model we construct a chemically reasonable network structure with a high fractional
conversion comparable to experiments in the epoxy resin system. The obtained crosslinking structure implies an
enhanced mechanical property of the resulting material.
