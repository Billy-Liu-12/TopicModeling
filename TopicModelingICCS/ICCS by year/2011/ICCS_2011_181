Abstract
The Third Workshop on Using Emerging Parallel Architectures (WEPA), held in conjunction with ICCS 2011, provides a forum
for exploring the capabilities of emerging parallel architectures such as GPUs, FPGAs, Cell B.E., and multi-cores to accelerate
computational science applications.

Heterogeneous Multi-cores, High Performance Computing

1. Introduction
Welcome to the Third Workshop on Using Emerging Parallel Architectures (WEPA). This workshop has been
motivated by the significant transformation of the computing landscape in recent years with the emergence of more
powerful processing elements such as CUDA-enabled GPUs, FPGAs, and Cell/BE. On the multi-core front, Moore's
Law has transcended beyond the single processor boundary with the prediction that the number of cores will double
every 18 months. Going forward, the primary method of gaining processor performance will be through parallelism.
Multi-core technology has visibly penetrated the global market. Accordingly to the Top500 lists, the HPC landscape
has evolved from supercomputer systems into large clusters of multi-core processors. Furthermore, GPUs, FPGAs
and heterogeneous multi-cores have been shown to be viable computing alternatives, where certain classes of
applications witness more than one order of magnitude improvement over their GPP counterpart. Therefore, future
computational science centres will employ resources such as FPGAs, GPUs and Cell architectures to serve as coprocessors to offload appropriate compute intensive portions of applications from the servers. This workshop
provides a forum for exploring the capabilities of emerging parallel architectures to accelerate computational science
applications.
The technical program was put together by the Workshop Chairs Bertil Schmidt and Douglas Maskell and 24
members of a distinguished program committee. 13 submissions were reviewed by at least three experts in the field.
Based on the reviews, 8 papers were selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the workshop
