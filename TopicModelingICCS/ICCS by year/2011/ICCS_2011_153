Abstract
In this paper, we discuss a family of multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element (MFMFE) methods on simplicial, quadrilateral, hexahedral, and triangular-prismatic grids. The MFMFE methods are locally conservative with continuous
normal ﬂuxes, since they are developed within a variational framework as mixed ﬁnite element methods with special
approximating spaces and quadrature rules. The latter allows for local ﬂux elimination giving a cell-centered system
for the scalar variable. We study two versions of the method: with a symmetric quadrature rule on smooth grids and a
non-symmetric quadrature rule on rough grids. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate ﬁrst order convergence
for problems with full-tensor coeﬃcients. Second order superconvergence is observed on smooth grids.
Keywords: mixed ﬁnite element, multipoint ﬂux approximation, cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerence, full tensor, simplices,
quadrilaterals, hexahedra, triangular prisms.

1. Introduction
We discuss the development of a family of numerical schemes for second order elliptic problems. These methods,
referred to as multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element (MFMFE) methods, allow for an accurate and eﬃcient treatment of
full tensor coeﬃcients, irregular geometries and heterogeneities that require highly distorted grids and discontinuous
coeﬃcients. These schemes are shown to be cell-centered discretizations and to have convergent approximations for
both the scalar variable and its ﬂux. Following the terminology for Darcy ﬂow, we refer to the scalar variable as
pressure and the ﬂux variable as velocity.
MFMFE methods can be viewed as variational counterpart of the multipoint ﬂux approximation (MPFA) methods
[1, 2, 3, 4]. In the MPFA ﬁnite volume framework, sub-edge (sub-face) ﬂuxes are introduced, which allows for
localization of velocity interactions around mesh vertices. Therefore ﬂuxes can be easily eliminated, resulting in a

cell-centered pressure scheme. Similar elimination is achieved in the MFMFE variational framework, by employing
appropriate ﬁnite element spaces and special quadrature rules. Our approach is based on the BDM1 [5] on triangles
and quadrilaterals, the BDDF1 [6] on tetrahedra or hexahedra, or the CD1 [7] spaces on triangular prisms with a
trapezoidal quadrature rule applied on the reference element. Related approaches have been developed in [8] on
simplicial grids and in [9, 10] on quadrilateral grids using a broken Raviart-Thomas space. A key element of our
methods is that the velocity space has n normal degrees of freedom on each edge (face), where n is the number of
vertices of the edge (face). In the case of a reference element with some square faces, the original BDDF1 (cube) and
CD1 (triangular prism) have only three degrees of freedom per face, which is insuﬃcient for local ﬂux elimination.
We enhance the spaces by adding an appropriate number of curl basis functions, so that the resulting spaces have four
degrees of freedom on square faces.
Due to their variational formulation, the MFMFE methods allow for multiscale and multiphysics extensions such
as the mortar mixed ﬁnite element methods [11, 12, 13] and the enhanced velocity method [14]. These methods can
handle non-matching grids and allow for coupling of diﬀerent numerical algorithms and diﬀerent physics in adjacent
subdomains. The multiblock variational framework is useful in designing optimal parallel solvers that utilize eﬃcient
interface multiscale bases as interface preconditioners and subdomain solvers such as algebraic multigrid. These
approaches have also been shown to be convergent and eﬃcient when applying stochastic methods for uncertainty
analyses [15, 16] and applying the MFMFE methods for multiscale modeling of nonlinear ﬂow problems in porous
media [17].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The MFMFE methods on various grids are deﬁned in Section
2. Theoretical convergence results are presented in Section 3. Numerical results conﬁrming the theory are discussed
in Section 4. Conclusions are given in Section 5.
2. Formulation of multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element methods
Consider a boundary value problem on a domain Ω ⊂ Rd , d = 2, 3, with a Lipschitz continuous boundary ∂Ω,
−∇ · A∇p = f
p=0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(2.1)
(2.2)

where p is an unknown scalar function, A is a symmetric, uniformly positive deﬁnite tensor with L∞ (Ω) components,
and f is a source term. The choice of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is made for simplicity of the
presentation; other boundary conditions can also be treated. Let H(div; Ω) := v ∈ (L2 (Ω))d : ∇ · v ∈ L2 (Ω) and let
(·, ·) denote the inner product in L2 (Ω). The weak mixed formulation of (2.1)-(2.2) reads: ﬁnd u := −A∇p ∈ H(div; Ω)
and p ∈ L2 (Ω), such that
(A−1 u, v) − (p, ∇ · v) = 0,

∀v ∈ H(div; Ω),

(2.3)

∀w ∈ L (Ω).

(2.4)

(∇ · u, w) = ( f, w),

MFMFE methods have been developed and analyzed in [18] on simplicial and quadrilateral grids, in [19, 20, 13]
on hexahedral grids and in [21] on triangular-prismatic grids. The method is deﬁned as: ﬁnd uh ∈ Vh and ph ∈ Wh
such that
(A−1 uh , v)Q − (ph , ∇ · v) = 0,
(∇ · uh , w) = ( f, w),

∀v ∈ Vh ,

(2.5)

∀w ∈ Wh

(2.6)

There are two key ingredients in the method. The ﬁrst one is an appropriate choice of mixed ﬁnite element spaces Vh
and Wh and degrees of freedom. The second one is a speciﬁc choice of the numerical integration rules for (·, ·)Q in
(2.5). These two choices allow for ﬂux variables associated with a vertex to be expressed by cell-centered pressures
surrounding the vertex. This results in a 9 point or 27 point pressure stencil on logically rectangular 2D or 3D grids.
The quadrature rule (2.22) can be symmetric or non-symmetric. We call the method symmetric or non-symmetric
MFMFE method depending on the choice of quadrature rule. On aﬃne or smooth grids, both the symmetric and
non-symmetric MFMFE methods give ﬁrst-order accurate velocities and pressures, as well as second order accurate

face ﬂuxes and pressures at the cell centers [18, 19, 20, 21]. On highly distorted quadrilateral and hexahedral grids
with non-planar faces, the convergence of the symmetric MFMFE can deteriorate while the non-symmetric MFMFE
still gives a ﬁrst order accuracy [20]. This is due to the fact that the non-symmetric quadrature rule satisﬁes some
critical properties on physical elements. On aﬃne grids, the two quadrature rules in (2.22) are the same if the tensor A
is constant in each element, since the Jacobian is a constant matrix. The non-symmetric quadrature rule was originally
proposed in [10] for quadrilateral grids.
We now discuss the two ingredients in detail.
2.1. Finite element spaces
Let Ω be a polyhedral domain partitioned into a union of ﬁnite elements of characteristic size h. The elements can
be triangles or quadrilaterals in 2D, tetrahedra, hexahedra, or triangular prisms in 3D. Let us denote the partition by
Th and assume that it is shape-regular and quasi-uniform [22]. The velocity and pressure ﬁnite element spaces on any
physical element E are deﬁned, respectively, via the Piola transformation
v ↔ vˆ : vˆ =
and the scalar transformation

JE

w ↔ wˆ : w = wˆ ◦ F E−1 ,

where F E denotes a mapping from the reference element Eˆ to the physical element E, DFE is the Jacobian of F E , and
JE is its determinant. The Piola transformation preserves the normal components of the vectors. The ﬁnite element
spaces Vh and Wh on Th are given by
Vh = v ∈ H(div; Ω) :
Wh = w ∈ L (Ω) :

Tetrahedra. In the case of tetrahedra, Eˆ is the reference tetrahedron with vertices rˆ 1 = (0, 0, 0)T , rˆ 2 = (1, 0, 0)T ,
rˆ 3 = (0, 1, 0)T , and rˆ 4 = (0, 0, 1)T . Let ri (i = 1, . . . , 4) be the corresponding vertices of E. The linear mapping for
tetrahedra has the form

F E (ˆr) = r1 (1 − xˆ − yˆ − zˆ) + r2 xˆ + r3 yˆ + r4 zˆ,

Hexahedra. In the case of hexahedra, Eˆ is the unit cube with vertices rˆ 1 = (0, 0, 0)T , rˆ 2 = (1, 0, 0)T , rˆ 3 = (1, 1, 0)T ,
rˆ 4 = (0, 1, 0)T , rˆ 5 = (0, 0, 1)T , rˆ 6 = (1, 0, 1)T , rˆ 7 = (1, 1, 1)T , and rˆ 8 = (0, 1, 1)T . Denote by ri = (xi , yi , zi )T , i =
1, . . . , 8, the eight corresponding vertices of E. We note that the element can have non-planar faces. In this case F E is
a trilinear mapping given by
F E (ˆr) = r1 (1 − xˆ)(1 − yˆ )(1 − zˆ) + r2 xˆ(1 − yˆ )(1 − zˆ) + r3 xˆyˆ (1 − zˆ) + r4 (1 − xˆ)ˆy(1 − zˆ)

In above equations, si , ti , wi (i = 0, . . . , 3) are real constants,
Triangular prisms. Consider a prism with two triangular bases and three parallelogram faces. Let Eˆ be a reference
prism with vertices rˆ 1 = (0, 0, 0)T , rˆ 2 = (1, 0, 0)T , rˆ 3 = (0, 1, 0)T , rˆ 4 = (0, 0, 1)T , rˆ 5 = (1, 0, 1)T , and rˆ 6 = (0, 1, 1)T .
Denote by ri = (xi , yi , zi )T , i = 1, . . . , 6, the six corresponding vertices of element E. Note that the three side faces are
parallelograms. In this case, F E is a linear mapping given by
F E (ˆr) = r1 (1 − xˆ − yˆ − zˆ) + r2 xˆ + r3 yˆ + r4 zˆ.

In all cases the velocity degrees of freedom (DOF) are chosen to be the normal components at n points on each
face where n is the number of vertices of that face. We choose these points to be the vertices. The dimension of the
space is dnv , where d is the dimension and nv is the number of vertices in E. Note that the original BDDF1 and CD1
spaces have only three DOF on square faces. These spaces have been enhanced to have four DOF on square faces.
This special choice is needed in the reduction to a cell-centered pressure stencil as described later in this section. In
addition, the normal components of the velocity vector across element faces are continuous, which is needed for an
H(div; Ω)-conforming velocity space as required by (2.7).

The non-symmetric quadrature rule has certain critical properties on the physical elements that leads to a convergent
method on rough quadrilaterals and hexahedra [20].
The global quadrature rule on Ω is then given as
(A−1 q, v)Q ≡

(A−1 q, v)Q,E .
E∈Th

2.3. Cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerences
The trapezoidal quadrature rule localizes the interactions of the velocity DOF. In particular, the DOF associated
with a vertex become decoupled from the rest of the DOF, resulting in a block-diagonal ﬂux mass matrix in (2.5)
with one block per grid vertex. The dimension of each block equals the number of faces that share the vertex. For
example, this dimension is 12 for logically rectangular hexahedral grids, see Figure 1. Inverting each local block in
the mass matrix in (2.5) allows for expressing the velocity DOF associated with a vertex in terms of the scalars at the
centers of the elements that share the vertex (there are eight such elements in Figure 1). Substituting these expressions
into the mass conservation equation (2.6) leads to a cell-centered system for the scalar. The stencil is 27 points on
logically rectangular hexahedral grids. The local linear systems and the resulting global system are positive deﬁnite
and therefore invertible for the symmetric MFMFE method and, under a mild restriction on the shape regularity of the
grids and/or the anisotropy of the permeability, for the non-symmetric MFMFE method; see (3.6) below. The reader
is referred to [18, 19, 20, 21] for further details on the reduction to a cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerence system.

addition, let · k be the norm in the Hilbert space H k (Ω) with functions whose derivatives of order k belong to L2 (Ω).
The norm in L2 (Ω) is denoted by · . Let X ( ) Y denote that there exists a constant C, independent of the mesh

Deﬁnition 3.1. The (possibly non-planar) faces of a hexahedral element E deﬁned via a trilinear mapping in three
dimensions are called generalized quadrilaterals.
Deﬁnition 3.2. A generalized quadrilateral with vertices r1 , · · · , r4 is called an h2 -parallelogram if

(3.1)

where | · |Rd is the Euclidean norm in Rd .
Deﬁnition 3.3. A hexahedral element is called a h2 -parallelepiped if all of its faces are h2 -parallelograms.
3.1. Convergence of the symmetric MFMFE
Theorem 3.1 ([18, 19, 21]). Let Th consist of simplices, h2 -parallelograms, h2 -parallelepipeds or triangular prisms.
, then, the ﬂux uh and scalar ph of the symmetric MFMFE method (2.5)–(2.6) satisfy

(3.4)

3.2. Convergence of the non-symmetric MFMFE
On simplicial grids, h2 -parallelograms, h2 -parallelepipeds, and triangular prisms, the non-symmetric MFMFE
method has same order of accuracy as the symmetric method. In addition, the non-symmetric method has ﬁrst order
convergence for the ﬂux and scalar on general quadrilaterals and for the face ﬂux and scalar on general hexahedra
with non-planar faces. These convergence properties are not shared by the symmetric method.
The stability and accuracy of the non-symmetric MFMFE method rely on some properties of the bilinear form
(A−1 ·, ·)Q deﬁned on the space Vh . We have
(A−1 q, v)Q =

(A−1 q, v)Q,E =

Conditions (3.6) and (3.8) impose mild restrictions on the element geometry and the anisotropy of the permeability
tensor K, see [10, 23].

4. Numerical results
In this section, we test the convergence for both symmetric and non-symmetric MFMFE methods on quadrilaterals
and hexahedra. The ﬂux error u − uh Fh is approximated by using 9-point or 3-point Gaussian quadrature rules on
faces or edges respectively. The scalar error p − ph is approximated by 27-point Gauss quadrature rule.
The resulting linear algebraic system is solved using the software HYPRE (high performance preconditioners)
developed by researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory4 . More precisely, we employ the generalized
minimum residual (GMRES) method with one V-cycle of algebraic multigrid as a preconditioner. The stopping criteria
of GMRES is that the relative residual error is less than 10−9 .
4.1. Quadrilaterals
Consider the problem (2.1)–(2.2) with a given analytical solution and a full tensor as
p(x, y) = sin(πx)2 sin (2πy) ,

A=

.

We consider both smooth and non-smooth meshes. The smooth mesh is deﬁned as a C ∞ map of a uniform mesh
on the unit square and the map is given as
x = xˆ − 0.07 sin(3π xˆ) cos(2πˆy),

y = yˆ + 0.06 cos(2π xˆ) sin(3πˆy).

The mesh is shown on the left in Figure 2. It is easy to check that the smooth mapping makes the elements to be
h2 -parallelograms. The second mesh consists of highly distorted quadrilaterals generated by randomly perturbing
each uniform mesh point within a square with edge length 0.6h centered at the grid point, see the right Figure 2. The
grids on the diﬀerent levels of reﬁnement are obtained by mapping or perturbing reﬁnements of the uniform grid.
Table 1 shows the numerical results on h2 -parallelogram meshes. As the theory predicts for both the symmetric
and non-symmetric MFMFE methods, we observe ﬁrst order convergence for the scalar and the ﬂux.
Table 2 demonstrates the convergence behavior for the randomly h-perturbed grids. Clearly the convergence of
the ﬂux and the scalar of the symmetric MFMFE method deteriorates. As Theorem 3.3 predicts the non-symmetric
MFMFE method has ﬁrst order convergence for both the ﬂux and the scalar on these highly distorted grids.

4.2. Hexahedra
We consider the problem (2.1)–(2.2) with a given analytical solution and a full tensor as
⎛
⎞
⎜⎜⎜ 2
1.25 1.5 ⎟⎟⎟
⎜⎜⎜
⎟
3
2 ⎟⎟⎟⎟ .
p(x, y, z) = sin(πx) sin(πy) sin(πz),
A = ⎜⎜ 1.25
⎝
⎠

We consider both smooth and distorted hexahedral meshes. The smooth ones are generated using the following
smooth map of uniform grids
x = xˆ + 0.04 sin(π xˆ) cos(2πˆy) cos(3πˆz),
z = zˆ + 0.06 cos(2π xˆ) cos(3πˆy) sin(πˆz).

y = yˆ − 0.05 cos(3π xˆ) sin(πˆy) cos(2πˆz),

This mapping yields an h2 -parallelepiped mesh. The second mesh is generated by randomly perturbing each uniform
mesh point within a cube with edge length 0.5h centered at the grid point. Element faces in both meshes are nonplanar. The meshes are shown in Figure 3.
Tables 3–4 show the convergence behavior of both the symmetric and non-symmetric MFMFE methods on the
two hexahedral meshes. The symmetric MFMFE method has ﬁrst order convergence for the ﬂux and scalar on the
smooth mesh. However on randomly perturbed hexahedral meshes, the convergence of symmetric MFMFE method
deteriorates. The non-symmetric MFMFE method has ﬁrst order convergence for both ﬂux and scalar on both smooth
and distorted hexahedra. This conﬁrms the theory established in Theorems 3.1–3.3.

Remark 4.1. On smooth grids, we also observe a second order superconvergence in the discrete norms for the
pressure and ﬂux error:
| p − ph | 2 ≡

|E|(p − ph )2 (me ),
E∈Th

| u − uh | 2Fh ≡

|E|
E∈Th e∈∂E

where me is the center of mass of the element E. The reader is referred to [18, 19, 20] for details.
5. Conclusions
We presented a family of accurate and eﬃcient cell-centered discretization methods, multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite
element methods on simplicial, quadrilateral, hexahedral, and triangular-prismatic grids. Both the symmetric and
non-symmetric methods have ﬁrst order convergence on smooth and aﬃne grids. In addition, the non-symmetric
method has ﬁrst order convergence on rough quadrilateral or hexahedral grids. We have also developed and analyzed
a post-processing technique on general hexahedra that gives an accurate ﬂux inside each element based on accurate
MFMFE face ﬂuxes [25].
