Abstract. There are currently many methods for triangular local interpolation:
Given triangular meshes P in three dimension space, the given flat triangles are
based only on the three vertices and three normal vectors, or PN triangles,
construct a smooth surface that interpolates the vertices of P. In this paper a
completely local interpolation scheme is presented to guarantee to join patches
G1 continuously around boundary curves of each PN triangle.

1 Introduction
It is well-known that the interpolation of curved triangular patches over PN triangular
meshes, each triangle is based on the three vertices and the corresponding normal
vectors, is an important tool in computer aided geometric design. The common
approach [1,2,3] is to firstly create a cross boundary tangent vector field for each
boundary and then to construct patches that agree with these cross boundary fields.
Steven [4] gave a unifying survey of the published methods. Stephen Mann [5]
discusses a method for increasing the continuity between two polynomial patches by
adjusting their control points. But all these methods must know the information of
two adjacent patches and they are not completely local method.
Stefan Karbacher [6] present a non-linear local subdivision scheme for the
refinement of triangle meshes. Overveld [7] gave an algorithm for polygon
subdivision based on point-normals. Alex Vlachos [8] introduced curved pointnormal (PN) triangles to replace the flat triangle. In these methods the authors only
consider the point-normals of the input triangle and they are completely local. But
they only construct C0 continuity meshes. In this paper our objective is to construct a
smooth G1 continuity surface.

2 Triangular G1 Local Interpolation Based on PN Triangles
In this paper we shall employ the quartic Bézier polynomial to define a triangular
patch with linear normal patch:
4 4 −i

ρ (λ1 , λ 2 , λ3 ) = ∑ ∑ b i, j,k B 4 i, j,k (λ1 , λ 2 , λ3 ); B 4 i , j ,k (λ1 , λ 2 , λ3 ) =

4!

Q1 ( λ1 , λ 2 , λ3 ) = λ1 q1, 0, 0 + λ 2 q 0,1, 0 + λ3 q 0,0,1

bi , j , k and qi , j , k are respectively the control points of curved patches of the surface
ρi and corresponding linear normal patches Ql .

a common boundary

As illustrated schematically in Fig.1, these two patches will share boundary edge
V1V3. To meet with G1 continuity, each of the four panels of four control points must
be coplanar. We get G1 continuity by adjusting the inner control points [5]. As
illustrated by red lines, an inner point has four constrains, but only three freedoms. In
order to solve the problem, we make the gray triangle degenerate to become a point.
So for quartic Bézier polynomial control points we have:

b4,0,0 = b3,1,0 = b3,0,1 ; b0,4,0 = b1,3,0 = b0,3,1 ; b0,0, 4 = b0,1,3 = b1,0,3

(2.3)

2.1 Determination of Boundary Curve
In the following parts of this section we only consider the edge e3 (V1V2 , λ3 = 0) (see

Fig. 2). We have b4, 0, 0 = b3,1, 0 and b0, 4, 0 = b1,3, 0 , the next is to determine b2, 2, 0 . Here
we decide the point b2, 2, 0 by the intersection of three planes: 1) The first plane is
decided by the point V1 and the corresponding normal N1; 2) The second plane is
decided by the point V2 and the corresponding normal N2; 3) The third plane is
decided by two lines, the one line is V1V2, another line is ((V1+V2)/2+ (N1+N2)/2).
2.2

Construct the Boundary Normal Curves

From equation (2.2) we can get Q1 ( λ1 , λ2 ,0) = λ1q1, 0,0 + λ2 q0,1,0 (on edge e3),
Ql (λ1 , λ2 ,0) must interpolate N1 and N2: q1,0,0 = ω1 N 1 ; q 0,1,0 = ω 2 N 2 , Where

ω1 , ω 2 are positive constants. If the boundary curve is G1 continuity, we must have
Q1 • (

) = 0 , or [λ1q1,0,0 + λ2 q 0,1,0 ] • [(b4,0,0 − b3,1,0 )λ13

+ 3(b3,1,0 − b2, 2,0 )λ1 2 λ 2 + 3(b2,2,0 − b1,3,0 )λ1λ 2 2 + (b1,3,0 − b0, 4,0 )λ 2 3 ] = 0

The equation equals zero means that the coefficients of each term must be zero and
we have b4, 0, 0 = b3,1, 0 and b0, 4, 0 = b1,3, 0 , so equation (2.4) can be simplified to the
following equation:
(q1,0,0 + q0,1,0 ) • (V1 − V2 ) = 0

(2.5)

Now the problem become to finding reasonable values for ω1 , then use equation
(2.5) to compute ω 2 . Here we set ω1 = 1 .
2.3 Decide the Inner Control Points

The next is to decide the still unknown inner control points b1, 2,1 ,b2,1,1 and b1,1, 2 . In
order to construct cross boundary G1 continuity, we must hold (the edge e3):

Ql (λ1 , λ2 ,0) • (

) = (λ1q1,0,0 + λ2 q0,1,0 ) • (
−
) = 0 (2.6)
∂λ2 ∂λ3
∂λ2 ∂λ3

The equation equals zero means that the coefficients of each term must be zero and
associate with equation (2.5), we can get following equations:

N1 • (V1 − b2,1,1 ) = 0 ; N 2 • (V2 − b1,2,1 ) = 0 ; ω2 N2 • (V2 − b2,1,1 ) +ω1 N1 • (V2 − b1,2,1 ) = 0 (2.7)
Using the same computation for e1 and e2, we have:
N3 • (V3 − b1,1,2 ) = 0 ; N2 •(V2 −b1,2,1) = 0 ; ω3 N3 • (V3 − b1,2,1 ) + ω 4 N 2 • (V3 − b1,1,2 ) = 0
N3 • (V3 − b1,1,2 ) = 0 ; N1 • (V1 − b2,1,1) = 0 ; ω5 N1 • (V1 − b1,1,2 ) +ω6 N3 • (V1 − b2,1,1 ) = 0 (2.8)
Unite equation (2.7) and (2.8), we get six equations, but we have 9 unknown
values. Here we optimized the fairness of the given patch by reducing its curvature
[9]. A standard measure for the surface quality in geometric modeling is the thin plate

Now we can determine the free parameters by minimizing E(s).

3 Conclusion
Methods for local interpolation of triangulated, parametric data have existed for many
years and received more and more attention. However it is difficult to construct cross
boundary continuity surface. So the presented local methods are C0 continuity. In this
paper we present a completely local method to construct G1 boundary continuity
patches based on the point-normals of the inputted flat triangles. The examples used
and shown (see Fig.3,4) demonstrate that this algorithm can produce a very smooth
mesh from an initial coarse mesh model. However in order to construct G1 boundary

a point and introduce non-regular points. The investigation about non-regular points is
not involved in this paper.
