Abstract. The governing equations for shallow water ﬂow on the sphere
are formulated in generalized curvilinear coordinates. The various analytic expressions for the diﬀerential operators are all mathematically
equivalent. However, numerical approximations are not equally eﬀective.
The accuracy of high-order ﬁnite element discretizations are evaluated
using the standard test problems proposed by Williamson et al (1992).
The so-called strong conservation formulation is far more accurate and
results in standard error metrics that are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the weak conservation form, Jorgensen (2003), Prusa
and Smolarkeiwicz (2003). Moreover, steady state solutions can be integrated much longer without ﬁltering when time-stepping the physical
velocities.

Introduction

The various terms that arise in a numerical model of the atmospheric general
circulation (e.g. material derivative, gradient and divergence) have a tangible,
physical existence that is independent of any coordinate-based description. However, coordinate-based representations are necessary for computing the explicit
form of all requisite terms. Because the precise form of these terms depends
upon the coordinate system being employed, a tensor representation is preferable. It allows the use of powerful mathematical tools to deduce relations that
are valid in any coordinate system, i.e. coordinate invariant forms, while conveying the physical interpretation of the symbolic representation. For example, the
equations of motion can be formulated using four diﬀerent forms of the velocity;
physical, contravariant, covariant or solenoidal. Although analytically equivalent, these lead to numerical approximations that are not equally eﬀective. Here,
we consider high-order ﬁnite element discretizations of the governing equations
in curvilinear coordinates.
High-order ﬁnite elements are well-suited to atmospheric modeling due to
their desirable numerical properties and inherent parallelism. The development
of discontinuous Galerkin approximations can be viewed as an extension of low
order ﬁnite-volume techniques for compressible ﬂows with shocks (Cockburn et
al 2000). Either nodal or modal basis functions can be employed in high-order

ﬁnite elements which are spectrally accurate for smooth solutions. A discontinuous Galerkin approximation is equivalent to a conservative ﬁnite-volume discretization where the jump discontinuity at an element boundary requires the
solution of a Riemann problem. In general, a ﬁlter is required to stabilize long
time integrations of the nodal discontinuous approximation of the shallow water
equations, due to the presence of nonlinear terms and their integration using
inexact Gaussian quadrature, Giraldo et al (2003).

Shallow Water Equations

The shallow water equations contain the essential wave propagation mechanisms
found in atmospheric general circulation models. These are the fast-moving gravity waves and nonlinear Rossby waves. The ﬂux form shallow-water equations in
curvilinear coordinates on the cubed-sphere are described in Rancic et al (1996)
and Sadourny (1972). Covariant and contravariant vectors are related through
the metric tensor by ui = Gij uj , ui = Gij uj , and G = {det(Gij )}1/2 .

h is the height above sea level. ui and uj are the contravariant and covariant

The metric tensor for all six faces of the cube is

v = (v1 , v2 ) in spherical coordinates is deﬁned by its covariant and contravariant components. For the vector (u1 , u2 ) on the cube, the Jacobi matrix of the
transformation between the sphere and cube is given by

The system of equations (1) is written in a weak conservation form. An alternative approach is to use a strong conservation form with physical velocities on
the lhs of the momentum equation.

The kinetic energy is coordinate invariant and expressed in terms of spherical velocity components. The gradient is a covariant quantity and is mapped
back to physical coordinates by the Jacobi matrix. The divergence is a scalar
obtained by diﬀerentiating the contravariant velocity components. Taylor et al
(1997) use an alternative approach where the time derivatives of the contravariant velocity components appear on the lhs of the momentum equation. Our
numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that time integration of (2) leads to
much smaller errors and reduces the amount of ﬁltering required to stabilize the
scheme.

The computational domain Ω is partitioned into ﬁnite elements Ωk . An approximate solution uh belongs to the ﬁnite dimensional space Vh (Ω). uh is expanded

To illustrate the discontinuous Galerkin approach, consider a scalar hyperbolic equation in ﬂux form,

Numerical Experiments

Numerical experiments are based on of Williamson et al (1992). Test case 2
is a stationary zonal geostrophic ﬂow. In theory, the equations can be integrated indeﬁnitely with the only source of errors being due to numerical truncation. The continuous and discontinuous Galerkin spectral element models were
integrated over 300 days using both the weak (1) and strong (2) conservation forms of the shallow water equations. The total number of elements was
9 × 6 = 54 and the number of Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points per element was
set to 16 × 16. In the case of the continuous Galerkin model, a second order explicit leap frog time integration scheme is applied together with a Robert-Asselin
(1972) time ﬁlter to damp the resulting computational mode. The time step size
was ∆t = 30 sec, respecting the CFL condition. The discontinuous Galerkin
model is integrated with the second order three stage SSP Runge-Kutta scheme
of Higueras (2004) using the same time step size. A spatial ﬁlter to stabilize
the time step was not applied during any of these integrations, Fischer and
Mullen (2001). Figure 1 contains plots of the eigenvalues of the inverse metric tensor Gij used to map covariant to contravariant quantities on the cube.
These clearly illustrate the magnitude of the stretching across one face of the
cube-sphere.
The results of the continuous Galerkin model integrations reveal that the
weak formulation becomes unstable after only six days. Whereas the strong form
can be stably integrated for over 300 days without any spatial ﬁltering with a
small growth in the error level. We attribute these results to several factors.
Weak conservative formulations implicitly map between the sphere and cube
with the inverse metric tensor, whereas the strong
√ form relies on the Jacobi matrix. The eigenvalues of the latter are a factor of 2 smaller. Figure 2 is a plot of
the l∞ geopotential height errors for the continuous Galerkin formulations. These
plots show that the errors are two orders of magnitude smaller for the strong
conservation formulation. The results for the discontinuous Galerkin scheme are
similar, namely the weak formulation becomes unstable after six days of integration. Once again the strong form remains stable for well over 300 days of
integration. Furthermore, the scheme conserves mass and the l∞ error remains
close to machine precision.

Conclusions

Taylor et al (1997) were not able to achieve or maintain machine precision level
errors because they employed a weak conservation form for the governing equations of motion. To fully exploit the accuracy of high-order ﬁnite elements, a
judicious choice of an appropriate form of the prognostic equations is required
when using generalized curvilinear coordinates. Our experience with a nodal
Galerkin method indicates that a ﬁlter is ultimately required for long integrations to stabilize the scheme, thereby improving and extending the recent results
of Nair et al (2004).
