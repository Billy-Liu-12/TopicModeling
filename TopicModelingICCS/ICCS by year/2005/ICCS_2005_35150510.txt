Abstract. Due to an increasing number of portable devices, a support
for quality of service (QoS) and security becomes an main issue in Mobile IP networks. However Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocol has ineﬃcient authenticating procedures that limit
its QoS. That is, a mobile node (MN) should be distributed new session
keys whenever it performs a handoﬀ. As computing power of mobile devices becomes greater, a key distribution using a symmetric key cannot
guarantee the security. Hence, we employ an ID-based cryptography to
intensify the security and when the MN moves to a new domain, a foreign
agent (FA) reuses previous session keys encrypted by a public key for the
fast handoﬀ. Our proposed scheme reduces handoﬀ delay and maintains
high security by exchanging previous session keys between FAs. The performance results show that the proposed scheme reduces the latency up
to about 63% compared to the previous ID-based AAA.

Introduction

Based on mobility as the essential characteristic for mobile networks, the Mobile
IP de facto standard solution for use with the wireless Internet was developed
by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Because the mobility implies
higher security risks than static operations in ﬁxed networks, there is a need to
develop technologies which will jointly enable IP security and the mobility over
wireless links, and thus adapting Mobile IPv6 to AAA protocol is suggested [2].
In the basic AAA protocol, AAA server distributes the session keys to MNs
and agents to guarantee the security when they transmit data. Currently AAA
protocol guarantees the security by using symmetric keys for information protection. Due to the drastically increasing computing power of devices, reliability

on transmitting data based on symmetric keys can be threatened. Hence it is desirable to consider AAA protocol using asymmetric keys to enhance the security
level. However when we consider Mobile IP networks which should support high
mobility patterns, it seems hard to apply due to heavy operations. In the previous
works whenever an MN arrives at a new domain, it performs a registration with
its home network and after the MN is successfully authenticated and authorized,
AAA server generates Mobile IP session keys (Mobile-Foreign, Foreign-Home,
and Mobile-Home session key), but these processes need lots of operation time.
In typical public key cryptography, the user’s public key is explicitly encoded in
a public key certiﬁcate. Therefore, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model
requires universal trust among the certiﬁcate issuers such as Certiﬁcate Authorities (CAs). This also has some well-known side eﬀects such as cross-domain trust
and certiﬁcate revocation. Moreover, PKI should maintain the structures such
as CAs, Registration Authorities (RAs), and a directory servers containing certiﬁcates. Therefore, Shamir introduces an ID-based cryptography concept which
simpliﬁes certiﬁcation management process [8].
In this paper, we propose an ID-based session key reuse mechanism which
enhances the security in forwarding session keys and reduces the handoﬀ time.
In Section 2, an overview of the Mobile IP with AAA protocol, modern data
encryption, and Identity (ID)-based cryptography are presented. We discuss the
proposed ID-based session key reuse mechanism in Section 3. After that its
performance is evaluated with previous methods in Section 4. Finally we conclude
the paper in Section 5.

AAA Protocol in Mobile IP

Within the Internet, an MN in an administrative area called a home domain often
needs to use resources provided by another administrative zone called a foreign
domain. An agent in the foreign domain that attends to the MN’s request is likely
to require that the MN provide some credentials that can be authenticated before
the access to foreign resources. The agent may not have direct access to the data
that is needed to complete the transaction. Instead, the agent is expected to
consult a foreign AAA server (AAAF) in the same foreign domain in order to
obtain the proof that the MN has acceptable credentials. Since the agent and
the AAAF are part of the same administrative domain, they are expected to
have security relationships that enable to transact information securely.
Since the AAAF itself may not have enough information to verify the credentials of the MN, it is expected to conﬁgure the veriﬁcation process of MN
credentials with home AAA server (AAAH). Once the authorization has been
obtained by the AAAF and the authority has notiﬁed the agent for the successful negotiation, the agent can provide the requested resources to the MN [7].
AAA protocol operates based on the security associations which are deﬁned by
sharing the session keys [9].

Identity (ID)-B ased Cryptography

The concept of ID-based encryptions and signatures is ﬁrst introduced by Shamir
in [8]. The motivation is to simplify certiﬁcate management and the essential idea
of the ID-based cryptosystem is that any string ID consisting of {0, 1}∗ can be
the public key, and the author explains this by giving the example of the e-mail
system [8]. The users should contact the Private Key Generator(PKG) to obtain
a private key. Hence the ID-based cryptosystem does not need to access the
public key directory and that means there is no need of PKI. Fig. 1 shows the
comparison between a public key cryptosystem and an ID-based cryptosystem.
For the secret communication in the public key cryptosystem, a sender should
access to the public key directory for acquiring a public key. However in the
ID-based cryptosystem, there is no need to access to the directory because an
identity which is opened in the public channel is also a public key.

Session Key Reuse with ID-Based Cryptography

In this section, we describe the session key reuse mechanism with ID-based
cryptography. In the proposed mechanism, we assume as follows:
• All nodes involved in Mobile IP with AAA protocol can calculate ID-based
cryptography operations.
• Registration REPly (RREP) message includes the validity of MN without
session keys.
• Private Key Generator (PKG) should have a master key to generate a private
key corresponding to a public key for agents and MNs.
Fig. 3(a) and (b) show a Mobile IP registration procedure in AAA protocol [7]
and a procedure of AAA protocol with an ID-based mechanism [4], respectively.
The ID-based mechanism uses a digital signature for implementing mutual authentication which is one of main characteristics for the public key cryptosystem. In this case, because it is mutual authentication between the MN and
Home Agent (HA), the authentication should occur at each entity (HA, FA, and
AAAH) between the MN and the HA.
Fig. 3(c) shows the proposed AAA protocol with the ID-based mechanism
which has modiﬁed procedure in the registration. The most remarkable diﬀerence

ID-Based Secure Session Key Exchange Scheme

is that a new FA (nFA) receives previous session keys from an old FA (oFA).
As you see in ﬁg 3(b), the previous ID-based mechanism [4] should provide
the signature veriﬁcation at each entity between the MN and the HA because
the MN should receive new session keys from the HA. As we all know, new
session keys are issued by the AAAH and delivered through the HA. Meanwhile,
the proposed mechanism provides the mutual authentication between oFA and
nFA in the delivery of session keys. This minimizes the usage of the public
key cryptography by using the previous session keys between oFA and HA at
the registration reply from the HA and also provides the security from various
attacks such as man in the middle attack. However, permanent using of issued
previous session keys may cause another security problem. So there is a need to
issue new session keys periodically based on timeout.
Registration Procedure in MIP with AAA Protocol
The following steps describe a process for the registration and authentication
procedures in the ID-based mechanism. Refer to Fig. 3(b) and Table 1.
(1) When the MN detects the handoﬀ is impended, it generates M 1(corresponding to RREQ in Basic AAA procedure) and <M 1>Smn@ which is a signature
for M 1 based on the MN’s ID, then sends them to an nFA. (2) The nFA authenticates the M 1 based on the MN’s ID and forwards messages to AAAH. (3)
The AAAH also authenticates the M 1 and sends M 1 (M 1 with new session
keys generated by AAAH) to HA. (4) After the HA registers a new CoA, (5) it
encrypts two session keys SM N −F A and SM N −HA based on the MN’s ID, and
generates M 2(corresponding to HAA in Basic AAA procedure) and its signature
based on the HA’s ID. Then it sends them to the AAAH. (6) The AAAH generates the signature of M 3 and sends it along with all received messages to the
nFA. (7) The nFA authenticates the M 3 and sends all received messages except
for <M 3>Smn@ . (8) The MN authenticates the M 2 based on the HA’s ID and
acquires two session keys. However, due to the absence of a security association
between the MN and the nFA, it is vulnerable for some attacks at this point.

it to the MN. (3) The MN creates M 1(RREQ in ID-based) and its signature
<M 1>Smn@ , and sends them along with {SF A−M N , SF A−HA }nF A@ . (4) The
nFA authenticates the M 1 by verifying the <M 1>Smn@ based on the MN’s ID
and gets required session keys by decrypting based on its private key. (5) The
nFA sends the M 1 to AAAH. (6) The AAAH sends the M 1 to HA. (7) The HA
conﬁrms a validity of the MN, registers the new CoA, and creates the encrypted
M 3 with a session key between the oFA and the HA. (8) The HA sends the M 3
to AAAH. (9) The AAAH sends the M 3 to nFA. (10) At this point, the nFA
conﬁrms the M 3 that means the nFA has right session keys. Hence the nFA
veriﬁes the oFA which sends these session keys and also the oFA can verify the
nFA which decrypts the encrypted message based on the nFA’s ID.

Performance Evaluation

The values for the system parameters are directly from previous works, especially
from [3] and [5]. And the time for Data Encryption Standard(DES), Message
Digest 5(MD5), and Rivest-Shamir-Adlman(RSA) encryption and decryption is
obtained from [10]. We compute the registration time with system parameters in
Table 2. On the basic AAA procedure, the time for RREQM N −nF A is computed
based on the following simple estimation: 0.5 ms (MN processing time)+2 ms
(propagation time in wireless links)+4.096 ms (message transmission time in
wireless links)+0.088 ms (DES encryption and decryption)+0.0096 ms (MD5
operation)= 6.69 ms. The registration message size is assumed to 1024 bytes
due to the RSA1024 operation [10]. Hence the message transmission time is
obtained by multiplying the bit rate in wireless links and the message size.

When we compare our proposed method to AAA with previous ID-based
one [4], the registration time of the proposed one is reduced because the former
uses the mutual authentication between the oFA and the nFA instead of the

securely and therefore there is no need for the authentication at every related
entity. Also the performance comparison shows that the proposed method takes
a little bit more time than [7] because of using the public key cryptography,
however it means the improved security level. The registration time required for
the proposed method has drastically decreased compared to [4].

As shown in Fig. 3, we have conﬁgured a simple virtual network topology
for the comparison of various methods. In Fig. 3(a), suppose that an MN moves

directly from HA to FA2 . At this process, the MN performs handoﬀ when it
moves to a new area. Fig. 3(b) shows another scenario in the same virtual network
topology. We assume that the MN moves zigzag within the overlapped area
between adjacent cells in scenario 2. Fig. 4 shows the results. Fig. 4(a) represents
a bar graph that shows the delay for the ﬁrst scenario of the virtual network
topology and Fig. 5(b) represents that of the second one. As you see in Fig. 4(a),
our proposed scheme shows better performance than the ID-based scheme [4]
even though it shows less performance than the basic AAA scheme [7]. And as
you see in Fig. 4(b), our proposed scheme shows much better performance than
previous two schemes. Even though the connection between the oFA and the
MN is completely destroyed while performing the handoﬀ, the proposed scheme
shows the better performance since the oFA and the nFA share same session
keys for the communication with the MN. Therefore MNs with high mobility
patterns in overlapped areas, they do not need frequent authentication steps.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed the session key reuse mechanism with ID-based
cryptography. Based on the public key cryptography, this mechanism guarantees
a higher level of security than the basic AAA mechanism [7] and has reduced
registration time comparing to the AAA with the ID-based mechanism [4]. The
result of the performance comparison also shows that the proposed mechanism
is superior to AAA with the ID-based one [4] in terms of delay up to about
63% in the registration process. But due to heavy operations of public key cryptography, it takes a little bit more time than the basic AAA method. However,
by minimizing the procedures which perform the public key cryptography, we
can reduce the delay of the registration comparing to [7] while maintaining the
similar level of security.
