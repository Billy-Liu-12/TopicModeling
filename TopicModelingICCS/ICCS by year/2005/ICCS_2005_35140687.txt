Abstract. This paper presents a generalized demosaicking procedure
suitable for single-sensor imaging devices. By employing an edge-sensing
mechanism and a spectral model, the proposed demosaicking framework
preserves both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the captured
image. Experimental results reported in this paper indicate that the solutions designed within the proposed framework produce visually pleasing
full color, demosaicked images.

Introduction

Color ﬁlter array (CFA) interpolation or demosaicking is an integral step in
single-sensor imaging solutions such as digital cameras, image-enabled wireless
phones, and visual sensors for surveillance and automotive applications, [1]-[6].
The CFA is used to separate incoming light into a mosaic of the color components
(Fig.1a). The sensor, usually a charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor, is essentially a monochromatic device [1],[7], and thus, the raw data that acquires in conjunction with the CFA constitute a K1 ×K2 gray-scale image z with scalar pixels z(p,q) , with p = 1, 2, ..., K1
and q = 1, 2, ..., K2 denoting the image row and column, respectively. The two
missing color components are estimated from the adjacent pixels using the demosaicking process to produce the full-color demosaicked image [8]-[11].
Although a number of CFA have been proposed, the three-color Red-GreenBlue (RGB) Bayer CFA pattern (Fig.1a) [12] is the most commonly used due to
the simplicity of the subsequent demosaicking procedure. Assuming the GRGR
phase in the ﬁrst row, a Bayer CFA image z, depicted in Fig.2a, can be transformed to a K1 × K2 three-channel image x (Fig.2b) as follows [1],[13]:
⎧
⎨ [z(p,q) , 0, 0] for p odd and q even,
x(p,q) = [0, 0, z(p,q) ] for p even and q odd,
(1)
⎩
[0, z(p,q) , 0] otherwise.
where x(p,q) = [x(p,q)1 , x(p,q)2 , x(p,q)3 ] denotes the color vector. The values x(p,q)k
indicate the R (k = 1), G (k = 2), or B (k = 3) CFA components. Since the
sensor image z is a mosaic-like gray-scale image, the missing components in x(p,q)
are set equal to zero to indicate their portion to the coloration of x.

A Generalized Demosaicking Procedure

Due to the dominance of the G component in the Bayer CFA pattern, most demosaicking procedures, for example those listed in [1]-[4],[7]-[9], start the process
by interpolating the G color plane. In order to quantify the contribution of the
adjacent samples, the missing component x(p,q)k is calculated as follows:
x(p,q)k =

{w(i,j) x(i,j)k }

(2)

(i,j)∈ζ

where x(i,j)k denotes the k-th components of the color vector x(i,j) = [x(i,j)1 ,
x(i,j)2 , x(i,j)3 ], with (i, j) ∈ ζ denoting the spatial location arrangements on the
image lattice (Figs.1b-e).
The normalized weighting coeﬃcients w(i,j) used in (2) are deﬁned as
w(i,j) = w(i,j) /

w(i,j)

(3)

(i,j)∈ζ

where w(i,j) ≥ 0 is the so-called edge-sensing weight. The weights w(i,j) are used
to regulate the contribution of the available color components inside the spatial
arrangements shown in Figs.1b-e. To ensure that the demosaicking procedure is
an unbiased solution, the condition (i,j)∈ζ w(i,j) = 1 must be satisﬁed, [1].

By populating the G color plane in Fig.3a via (2) with k = 2 and ζ =
{(p−1, q), (p, q−1), (p, q+1), (p+1, q)} (Fig.1b), the missing R (or B) components
of x can be obtained through the use of the spectral correlation that exists
between the G and R (or B) components of a natural image. Adopting the
notation and concept introduced in [13], the R (k = 1) or B (k = 3) components
x(p,q)k are calculated in Fig.3b as follows:
¯
x(p,q)k = x(p,q)2 ⊕

{w(i,j) (x(i,j)k ⊕ x(i,j)2 )}

(4)

(i,j)∈ζ

¯ denote the spectral quantity formation and normalization opwhere ⊕ and ⊕
erations, respectively. The procedure ﬁrst produces the R and B components
x(p,q)k located in the center of the shape-masks ζ = {(p − 1, q − 1), (p − 1, q +
1), (p + 1, q − 1), (p + 1, q + 1)} (Fig.1c), and then those located in the center of
the shape-masks ζ = {(p − 1, q), (p, q − 1), (p, q + 1), (p + 1, q)} observed for the
updated planes (Figs.1d,e).
Since the G color plane was populated without the utilization of the essential spectral characteristics, the demosaicked G components obtained using (2)
should be re-evaluated in Fig.3c as follows [13]:
¯
x(p,q)2 = x(p,q)k ⊕

{w(i,j) (x(i,j)2 ⊕ x(i,j)k )}

(5)

(i,j)∈ζ

where ζ = {(p − 1, q), (p, q − 1), (p, q + 1), (p + 1, q)}, as shown in Fig.1b.
Finally, the proposed demosaicking procedure completes by correcting the
demosaicked R and B components (Fig.3d). This demosaicking step is realized
using (4) with k = 1 for R and k = 3 for B components. As before, the spatial
arrangements of the adjacent samples are described using ζ = {(p−1, q −1), (p−
1, q + 1), (p + 1, q − 1), (p + 1, q + 1)} (Fig.1c) and ζ = {(p − 1, q), (p, q − 1), (p, q +
1), (p + 1, q)} (Figs.1d,e).

Taxonomy of Demosaicking Solutions

Within the proposed generalized demosaicking framework, numerous demosaicking solutions may be constructed by changing the form of the spectral model, as
well as the way the edge-sensing weights are calculated. The choice of these two
construction elements essentially determines the characteristics and the performance of the single-sensor imaging solution, [1],[13],[14].

3.1

Non-adaptive Versus Adaptive Solutions

Based on the nature of the determination of w(i,j) in (3), the demosaicking
solutions can be diﬀerentiated as i) non-adaptive, and ii) adaptive demosaicking
schemes.
Non-adaptive demosaicking schemes such as those listed in [15]-[18] use a simple linear averaging operator (ﬁxed weights w(i,j) = 1) without considering any
form of adaptive weighting, [1],[13]. Since non-adaptive schemes do not utilize
structural information of the captured image to direct the demosaicking process,
they produce the full-color images with blurred edges and ﬁne details.
To restore the demosaicked image in a sharp form, adaptive demosaicking
solutions use the edge-sensing weights w(i,j) to emphasize inputs which are not
positioned across an edge and to direct the demosaicking process along the natural edges in the captured image, [1],[19],[20]. In most available designs, such
as those listed in [13],[14],[21]-[25], the edge-sensing coeﬃcients w(i,j) use some
form of inverse gradients. In order to design a cost-eﬀective and robust solution, the following form of w(i,j) deﬁned using inverse gradients [13],[26] is used
throughout the paper:

w(i,j) =

Component-Wise Versus Spectral Model-Based Solutions

Based on the use of the essential spectral characteristics of a captured image
in the demosaicking process, the demosaicking schemes can be divided into the
following two classes: i) component-wise, and ii) spectral model based solutions.
The component-wise processing solutions do not use the spectral correlation
that exists between the color channels in a natural image. Such a demosaicking
procedure uses (2) to fully populate R (k = 1), G (k = 2), and B (k = 3) color
planes. It has been widely observed [1],[20]-[28] that the omission of the spectral
information in the component-wise demosaicking process in [3],[16],[17] leads to
a restored output which contains color artifacts and color moire noise.
The use of the spectral model preserves the spectral correlation that exists
between the color components. Since natural RGB images exhibit strong spectral correlation characteristics [1],[6],[18], both researchers and practitioners in
the camera image processing community rely on spectral models to eliminate
spectral artifacts and color shifts. A commonality of the currently used spectral
models of [1],[15],[27],[28] is that they incorporate RG or BG spectral characteristics into the demosaicking process. The spectral model based demosaicking
procedure, such as those used in [2],[18],[22],[23],[25], ﬁrst populates the G color
plane (Fig.3a) via (2), and then use the spectral characteristics in the demosaicking steps (Figs.3b-d) deﬁned via (4), (5). It has been shown in [13] that the use
¯ in (4)-(5) generalize the previous spectral models. Assuming for the
of ⊕ and ⊕
simplicity the color-diﬀerence based modelling concept, the spectral modelling
¯ denote the addition and subtraction operations, respectively,
operators ⊕ and ⊕
and these modelling operations are used throughout the paper.

Experimental Results

To examine the performance of the basic demosaicking solutions designed within
the proposed generalized framework, a number of test images have been used.
Examples such as the 512 × 512 images Snake, Girls, and Butterﬂy are depicted
in Fig.4). These test images, which vary in color appearance and complexity of
the structural content (edges), have been captured using three-sensor devices
and normalized to 8-bit per channel RGB representation.
Following common practices in the research community [1],[2],[6],[18], mosaic
versions of the original color images are created by discarding color information in a GRGR phased Bayer CFA ﬁlter (Fig.1a) resulting in the CFA image
z. The demosaicked images are obtained from applying the demosaicking solution designed within the proposed framework (Fig.3) to process the CFA image.
Comparative evaluations are performed by comparing, both objectively and subjectively, the original full color images to demosaicked images. To facilitate the
objective comparisons [1], the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean square error (MSE) and the normalized color diﬀerence (NCD) criterion are used. While
the MAE and MSE criteria are deﬁned in the RGB color space which is conventionally used for storing or visualization purposes, the perceptual similarity
between the original and the processed image is quantiﬁed using the NCD criterion expressed in the CIE LUV color space [29].

To demonstrate the importance of the edge-sensing mechanism and the spectral model, the four solutions designed within the proposed framework (Fig.3)
deﬁned in (2),(4), and (5) are considered. Namely, the selected demosaicking
schemes include the non-adaptive component-wise scheme (NCS), the adaptive
component-wise scheme (ACS), the non-adaptive, spectral model-based scheme
(NSMS), and the adaptive, spectral model based scheme (ASMS).
Table 1 summarizes the objective results obtained by comparing the diﬀerent
solutions designed within the proposed demosaicking framework. It can be easily seen that the NCS scheme is the worst performing method among the tested
schemes. This should be attributed to its non-adaptive and component-wise nature. The use of the adaptive its adaptive ACS variant improves the result in
terms of all objective criteria. However, the signiﬁcant improvement of the performance of the demosaicking process is observed when the processing solution
employs both the spectral model and the edge-sensing mechanism.
Figs.5 depicts enlarged parts of the test images cropped in edge areas which
are usually problematic for Bayer CFA demosaicking schemes. The results show
that NCS and ACS solutions blur edges and produce a number of color shifts
in the demosaicked image, while the ASMS solution produces the highest visual
quality among the tested schemes.

Conclusion

A generalized demosaicking framework for single-sensor imaging was presented.
The framework allows for the utilization of both the spatial and spectral characteristics during the demosaicking process. Experimentation performed here
suggests that both the spectral model and the edge-sensing mechanism should
be used in the demosaicking pipeline.
