Abstract. A Finite Element Method using a C++ code is developed to
study the mechanical wave propagation in saturated porous soils. The
modelization uses the complete Biot theory including the couplings between the solid and fluid phases. A matrix-free algorithm and a selection
data technique are implemented in the code. Researches are focused on
homogeneous and heterogeneous semi-infinite media in the case of transient regimes. The time domain results present the displacements over
and within the half-space. In particular, we will see that the fluid wave
front is strongly dependent on the proportion of heterogeneities in the
ground.

Introduction

The study of the mechanical wave propagation in porous media is a subject of
great interest in diverse scientiﬁc ﬁelds ranging from environmental engineering
or vibration isolation to geomechanics. A saturated porous medium is a medium
that presents on the microscopic spatial scale a solid deformable skeleton and
a porous space ﬁlled with a viscous ﬂuid. A macroscopic formulation can be
deduced from the microscopic approach by homogenization: in this case, the
medium is considered as a two-phase continuum. Biot’s articles (see [1] and
[2]) and Bourbi´e et al.’s review [3] are works of reference for the macroscopic
mechanical wave propagation theory. In such a medium, three body waves exist:
the P1 and P2 compressional waves and the S shear wave. The ﬁrst compressional
wave is a wave said to be quick whereas the second compressional wave is said
to be slow and strongly attenuated. Moreover, for a semi-inﬁnite medium, a
surface wave also exists denoted as the Rayleigh R wave. Theoretical works are
restricted to simple geometries. Consequently, they have to be completed by
numerical approaches such as Finite Element or Boundary Element Methods,
allowing the study of more complex problems to better modelize the ground.
The diﬃcult study of transient regimes has been treated numerically for speciﬁc
cases by several authors: Zienkiewicz and Shiomi [4], Simon et al. [5] and Gajo et
al. [6] for instance. In this paper, the authors propose a Finite Element Method
of the whole Biot’s equations in the case of homogeneous and heterogeneous soils.
An eﬃcient and accurate C++ code is developed to deal with this problematic.

Governing Equations

The theoretical approach is formulated using the Biot model: writing ui and Ui
respectively the solid and ﬂuid displacement components, with usual notations,
Biot’s equations can be written as follows
¨i
¨i + φρf U
σij,j = (1 − φ)ρs u

¨i
p,i = − K (Ui − u˙ i ) + ρf (a − 1)¨

The soil’s characteristics are: λ0v and µv (drained Lam´e constants for the
purely viscoelastic equivalent porous media), ρs and ρf (solid grains and ﬂuid
densities), φ (porosity), K (hydraulic permeability), a (tortuosity), M and β
(Biot coeﬃcients).
(1) and (2) are the motion equations, (3) and (4) are the constitutive relationships including a physical viscoelastic hysteretic Rayleigh damping of the
soil.

Finite Element Formulation and Numerical Resolution

In order to obtain a ﬁrst order time diﬀerential system, the solid and ﬂuid particles’ velocities are introduced: vi = u˙ i and Vi = U˙ i . Then, some algebraic manipulations are done to yield in the end a diagonal mass matrix. The weighted
residual method with Galerkin ponderation gives integral forms (5) and (6) de2
ﬁned in the vector space V (f ) = [0, T ] × { ∂f
∂t ∈ L (Ω), f ∈ H1 (Ω)} where T and
(Ω) are respectively the study time and the study space.

The weak formulation is then transformed using the Green theorem that introduces the boundary conditions. Then, for respectively two-dimensional and
three-dimensional problems, triangular and tetrahedral linear isoparametric elements are used to mesh the (Ω) space. Afterwards, we can get an approximative
solution of the second formulation with analytical discretization of the displacement and velocity components.

It requires inner iterations for each time step until the tolerance criterium is
reached.

Structure of the Code

The Finite Element C++ code is organized in three classes: element, elementary
matrices and building-resolution classes. Thus, three objects connected by a
single heritage are constructed and they form a solver. In practise, we obtain
very low sized solvers (less than 1000 C++ lines).
In this code, the mass and stiﬀness matrices are never built because a matrixfree technique is used. As the global mass matrix is diagonal, its inversion is an
easy process. The size of the global vector of unknowns is optimized by the use
of an expert multigrid system called AMS (see [7] and [8]). On the whole, a high
performance level is obtained both in terms of CPU and storage costs.

Results
Half-Space Model

A vertical impulse (y axis) load acts over the free surface (x axis) of a twodimensional half-space. The soil characteristics are relative to a porous stiﬀ
ground: the dimensionless values are given in Table 1. In all the following section, the numerical values are dimensionless, using three independent mechanical
quantities. Dirichlet’s conditions corresponding with the zero displacements for
both phases are imposed at depth at the border of the medium. The (Ω) space
is meshed with 50 626 triangular elements and 25 617 eight-degrees-of-freedom
nodes.

Homogeneous Case

Figure 1(a) presents the horizontal solid displacements on the surface of the
half-space (−3 < x < 3, y = 0) versus time variable (0 < t < 2). The P1
(respectively R) contribution is focused on a line the slope of which corresponds
to the P1 (resp. R) celerity. The S wave is lost to the eye due to the dominating
Rayleigh wave: its contribution could be seen when in vertical displacements.
The P2 wave carries very little energy and is mixed with the whole surface
displacement which here prevents us from seeing it. The P1 and R waves give
opposite contributions with a preponderant part to Rayleigh’s. Moreover, in the
case of a vertical sollicitation as studied here, the horizontal displacement is
an odd function of x variable, whereas the vertical displacement is even. Also
note, from the same ﬁgure, that the displacement decreases geometrically in
addition to the physical damping. In Figure 1(b), which shows a section of Figure
1(a) for x = 1.5, a visualization of the vertical displacement is added. The
theoretical arrival times are underlined and the contribution of the S wave is
clearly perceptible on the vertical displacement.
Figure 2(a) shows the variation of the ﬂuid vertical displacements in depth
under the load (x = 0) versus time variable. The Rayleigh wave decreases exponentially with depth. Consequently, the displacements underline the two compressional waves P1 and P2. On Figure 2(b), the two theoretical lines relative
to each wave speed are plotted: a good agreement is obtained with the contour
levels.
Figures 3 and 4 are plotted for t = 1.5. The P1 wave front corresponds
to a half-circle the radius of which equals 2.8: this is clearly perceptible on
Figure 3. From the same ﬁgure, note that the Rayleigh wave gives a predominant
contribution on the surface: this corresponds to the red areas beginning at x =
1.6. Moreover, with the chosen parameters, the ﬂuid and solid phases are strongly

uncoupled, thus the S wave exists only in the solid phase (x = 1.7). Due to the
competition between the R and S waves which have neighboring speeds, the S
wave front is more perceptible in depth.
For the ﬂuid phase, Figure 4, red zones are caused by the P1 wave which
presents a more widely spread time wave front. This analysis has been conﬁrmed
by a study of the displacements of time-related individual points positioned
under the load.

Heterogeneous Case

The ground is constituted by a mixture of two kinds of media which are distributed randomly: the main part of this heterogeneous soil has the characteristics deﬁned in Table 1. The second one represents softer inclusions (λ0 =0.011,
µ=0.011, M = 0.271, β=0.995, φ=0.6, η=1) and its proportion ranges from 1
percent to 40 percent.
In these cases, the solid wave fronts are on the whole less modiﬁed than
the ﬂuid ones, (see Figures 5 and 6). They remain well-ordered up to at least
a 20 percent distribution. For a higher proportion, the solid wave fronts are
dismembered and the contour levels are not concentric any more. Moreover, the
inclusions focus the mechanical deformations over a smaller area in which the
displacement values are higher. The presence of soft elements slows down the
progression of the solid and ﬂuid deformations in comparison with the purely
homogeneous case.
As for the ﬂuid phase, even for a low proportion of inclusions (1 or 5 percent),
the wave fronts are disordered. Some areas present higher deformations due to

the higher proportion of ﬂuid in the softer inclusions. Moreover, ﬂuid amplitudes,
which are lower than solid ones in the homogeneous case, become equal if not
higher with the inclusions. In conclusion, a deeper change occurs for the ﬂuid
phase.

Conclusion and Further Works

The study of the mechanical wave propagation has been carried out using a ﬁnite
element method and a modiﬁed backward diﬀerence method for the time integration algorithm. A matrix-free algorithm and a selection data technique are
implemented in the C++ objet-oriented program. Diﬀerent examples of homogeneous and heterogeneous semi-inﬁnite media have been presented. Further works
will include the parallelisation of the code and the study of three-dimensionnal
geometries.
