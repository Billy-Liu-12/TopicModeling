Abstract. The inductive learning algorithms are the very attractive methods
generating hypothesis of the target concept on the base of the set of labeled
examples. This paper presents some of the rules generation methods, their
usefulness for the rule-base classifier and their quality of classification for the
medical decision problem.

1 Introduction
Machine learning [1,5] is the attractive approach for building decision support
systems. In the paper we compare the heuristic classifier (given by experts) and three
another generated by the chosen inductive learning methods.
The content of the work is as follows. Section 2 introduces idea of the inductive
decision tree algorithms and learning sets of rules method. In Section 3 we describe
mathematical model of the acute abdominal pain decision problem. Next section
presents results of the experimental investigations of the algorithms. Section 4
concludes the paper.

2 Algorithms
We chose three of the inductive learning algorithm: (1) C4.5 algorithm given by R. J.
Quinlan [2], (2) Fuzzy Decision Tree Algorithm FID 3.0 given by C. Janikow [3] and
(3) Rule generation algorithm - AQ given by R. Michalski [4].
2.1 Inductive Decision Tree
Algorithms C4.5 and FID are based on “Top Down Induction of Decision Tree”
(TDIST) procedure[2]. The central choice in the TDIDT algorithm is selecting which
attribute to test at each node in the tree. The chosen algorithms use the information
gain that measures how well the given attribute separates the training examples
according to the target classification. This measure based on the Shanon’s entropy of
set S. The information gain of an attribute A relative to the collection of examples S, is
defined as

where values( A) is the set of all possible values for attribute A and S v is the subset of
S for which A = v .
2.2 Learning Set of Rules

The algorithms like CN2 [1] or AQ [4] based on the learning one rule (LOR) strategy,
removing data it covers, then iterating the process. The LOR method is similar to the
ID3. The LOR algorithms follow only the most promising branch in the tree at the
each step – returns only one rule, which covers at least some of the examples.

3 Model of Acute Abdominal Pain Diagnosis
The mathematical model of the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain (AAP) was
simplified by experts from the Clinic of Surgery, Wroclaw Medical Academy. It leads
to the following classification of the AAP: appendicitis, (2)divercitulitis, (3) smallbowel obstruction, (4) perforated peptic ulcer, (5) cholecystitis, (6) pancreatitis, (7)
non-specyfic abdominal pain, (8)rare disorders of “acute abdominal”.
Although the set of symptoms necessary to correctly assess the existing APP is
pretty wide, in practice for the diagnosis, results of 36 (non-continuos) examinations
are used, whose are presented in table I.

4 Experimental Investigation
The presented algorithms C4.5, FID and AQ were used for creating rules for APP
decision problem. Their frequencies of correct classification were compared with
quality of heuristic classifier. The set of data has been gathered in the Surgery Clinic
Wroclaw Medical Academy. It contains 476 learning examples.
For each learning method the following experiment was made:
•
•

from the learning set 40 examples was chosen (according with frequency of the
class appearance); this set was use for test,
the rest of examples (436) were training ones.

This procedure was repeated 20 times for each of the algorithms. The results of the
experiments are presented in Table 2 .

The results of test are clear. The classifier given by C4.5 algorithm is always better
than heuristic one. The AQ and FID algorithm gives the better results for some of
class, but for another the frequency of correct classification is very low.
Experts revised the structures of classifiers given by inductive learning algorithms.
They confirmed that all of rules were correct and maybe the heuristic classifier was
incomplete.

5 Conclusion
The methods of inductive learning were presented. The classifiers generated by those
algorithms were applied to the medical decision problem (recognition of Acute
Abdominal Pain). The results of test were compared with recognition quality of
heuristic algorithm.
It must be emphasised that we have not proposed a method of "computer
diagnosis". What we have proposed are the algorithms whose can be used to help the
clinician to make his own diagnosis. The superiority of the presented empirical results
for the inductive learning classifiers over heuristic one demonstrates the effectiveness
of the proposed concept in such computer-aided medical diagnosis problems.
Advantages of the proposed methods make it attractive for a wide range of
applications in medicine, which might significantly improve the quality of the care
that the clinician can give to his patient.
