Abstract. This paper discussed the resource allocation and reservation for wireless network, which is a challenging task due to the mobility uncertainty of
user, Motivated from a rationale, i.e., a good data compressor should be a good
predictor, we proposed a mobility prediction algorithm. Integrating the prediction algorithm into GC, a resource allocation scheme is also proposed. The numerical simulation results show that the time-complexity of our proposed
scheme is worse, but it outperforms Fixed-percent and ExpectedMax in the QoS
support effectiveness.

1 Introduction
As known, the movement of the mobile users is greatly uncertain, which greatly impacts the efficiency of QoS schemes in wireless networks. In information theory, the
Shannon entropy is a good method to quantitatively describe the uncertainty. In the
same way, it can also scale the uncertainty of movement of mobile user. If the trajectory of movement of mobile user is regarded as a sequence of event, we can predict
the next event by a certain data compression algorithm. Motivated by the theoretic
bases and observations, this paper proposes a novel resource allocation and reservation scheme based on Ziv-Lempel algorithm, which is both theoretically optimal and
good in practice.

2 The Description of the Model of User Mobility
Here, we use a generalized graph model to represent the actual wireless network
(shown as Fig.1), where the cell shape and size may vary depending on many factors,
such as the receiver sensitivity, the antenna radiation pattern of the base stations, and
propagation environment, and the number of neighboring cells, which can be arbitrary
but bounded and vary from cell to cell. An actual network can be represented by a
bounded-degree, connected graph G = (V, E), where the vertex-set V represents pairs
of cells and the edge-set E represents the adjacency between pairs of cells. The example network shown in Fig. 1 can be modeled by the vertex set V={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}
and the edge set E={(a,d),(a,b),(b,c),…,(e,g).

In wireless networks, a call during its lifetime can be represented by a sequence of
events {N H1H2SH3HnS...E}, where N denotes the event that a new call is admitted, Hn
denotes the event of a mobile user nth handoff, S denotes the event of the call sojourning in the same cell and E denotes the call termination event. Note that in some cases,
there are no handoff events during the lifetime of a call and thus no Hn in the sequence of events. According to the representation of the call events sequence, the
trajectory of movement of mobile user can be also easily represented by a sequence of
cells {v}, where v( ) denotes the cells users handoff to. In the example network shown
in Fig. 1, the trajectory of movement of a certain mobile user may be the cells sequence {aabbbchfddedfch…}. For a mobile user, its current location and the trend of
movement can be described through these two sequences.

3 Mobility Predictions and Update Based on Data Compressor
For the mobility prediction processing, some literatures assume that the users independently handoff to its neighboring cells with equal probability, or assume that all of
handoff events are independent and identically distributed. However, neither of them
can exactly depict the mobility of users. Contrarily, the high-order Markov chain and
the finite-context model are fairly reasonable. Of course, the order is higher, and the
depictions of the actual movement can be more accurate, but the calculations of conditional probability and joint probability are also more difficult. Based on the definitions of entropy and conditional entropy in Ref. [6-7], the conditional entropy has a
limit which equals to the per symbol entropy for a stationary stochastic process. So
for each Markov chain and finite-context model, it is sure that there exists an appropriate order that depends on the mobility pattern. But its determination is a strenuous
work, which root from the following factors. Firstly, its codeword is fixed-length
because the conditional events of the N-order Markov chain are usually represented as
vn|v1v2…vn-1, which is equivalent to N-symbol codeword. Secondly, the relationship in
the context is simplex and independent, and does not vary with the input sequences.
Hence, for the mobility prediction processing, only the model with variable-length
codeword and adaptive-context is reasonable and practicable. According to the analyses of Ref. [2-3], the symbol-based version of the Ziv-Lempel algorithm can become
the best candidate for the model because it is both theoretically optimal and good in
practice.

Essentially, the Ziv-Lempel algorithm is universal variable-to-fixed coding scheme,
which parses the input string S into block-to-variable distinct but the shortest substrings {s1, s2 s3,…} in a greedy manner. For each j≥1, substring sj without its last
character is equal to some previous substring si, where j>i≥0.
Example 1: Let the symbols be {a,b,c,d}, and given an input string
S={aaababbbbbaabccddcbaaaa…}, then the Ziv-Lempel encoder can parse it into the
substrings {a,aa,b,ab,bb,bba,abc,c,d,dc,ba,aaa,…}.

The Ziv-Lempel coding process is interlaced with the learning process for the
source characteristics. The key to the learning is a greedy decorrelating process,
which implements by efficiently creating and looking up an explicit codeword dictionary. Because of the prefix property, substring parsed so far can be efficiently
maintained in a trie [3], which can store statistics information for contexts explored
besides representing the codeword dictionary. Fig. 2 shows the trie formed by Example 1. Through the trie, a new codeword can be easily created by concatenating a
single symbol v to a parsed codeword si. As the parsing process progresses along with
the string extending, larger and larger codeword accumulate in the dictionary. At the
same time, the trie will be updated. Consequently, the estimates of conditional probabilities for larger contexts can be built up. Moreover, the learning capacity of the trie
can be boosted up, and its prediction is also more precise.
The trajectory of movement of mobile user can be regarded as a substring in the
symbol-based Ziv-Lempel algorithm. Similarly as shown in Fig. 3, we can also construct a mobility pattern predictor of the mobile user according to its mobility information base, which is equivalent to the trie. In natural, the predictor is a probability
model based on Ziv-Lempel algorithm. When a new call is admitted, the predictor will
set the current cell as a root of its mobility pattern, and update the probabilities of its
possible events (including handoff and termination) during the call lifetime. When an
event occurs in the sampling point, the predictor firstly judges whether it is the mobility pattern or not. If it is in the pattern, then the mobility pattern will be extended to
the deeper layer, and be ready to the next prediction. Contrarily, a prediction fault is
generated, and the mobility pattern and the context of current codeword are updated,
as shown the red mark part in Fig. 3.

The performance of the predictor can be evaluated by two metrics, i.e., the prediction fault rate and the expected fault rate. The former is defined as the ratio of the
total number of prediction faults to the total number of events, and the latter is defined
as the best possible fault rate achievable by any prediction algorithm which makes its
prediction based only on the past mobility pattern history.

4 The Dynamic Resource Allocation and Reservation Scheme
Since forced call terminations due to handoff blocking are generally more objectionable than new call blocking, the handoff of a call should be treated in higher priority
than the admission of new call, which is a default rule for service provider, and is also
the premise of our scheme in this paper. To improve the QoS capacity of wireless
networks, we must address the resource allocation and reservation scheme, which
critical evaluating factors usually include handoff dropping probability, new call
blocking probability, and the reserved resource utilization.
Among many schemes, the guard channels (GC) policy [1] and its revisions are
simple, but they cannot satisfy the fluctuation of resource requirement due to user’s
mobility. However, their drawbacks can be overcome if their operations are based on
the mobility predictor. So we can propose a scheme called prediction-based GC.
Before the prediction-based GC puts into effect, the most likely cellj (marked as
MLC), which a mobile user may handoff to, must be firstly selected from the neighbor
(marked as Neighbor_Cell) of current Celli based on the mobility predictor in section

3. Neighbor_Cel(Cellf) can be obtained from the non-zero items in the adjacency
matrix (1). Note that the two cell set meet the following relation:
Cell j ∈ MLC (Celli ) ⊆ Neighbor _ Cell (Celli )

(1)

Then we can pertinently allocate and reserve resource in MLC(Celli) for the call during its lifetime.

Fig. 4. The model of resource allocation and reservation during the call lifetime

As shown in Fig. 4, the call which handoffs to or originates from Celli is our discussion objective. Assumed that the call comes from N1 source neighbor cells, and
possibly handoffs to N2 target neighbor cells. There exist ni and ni calls in each source
and target neighbor cells, respectively. According to the above mobility predictor, we
can get the context (i.e., transition probability) of the handoff event from Cellj to Celli
(from Celli to Cell j’). The resource requirement in Celli will fluctuate along with the
calls continuously arrival at and departure from Celli, which is represented as follows:
N1

nl'

N2

∆BW ( N 1, N 2 ) = ∑ Pl ,i ⋅ ∑ BWk − ∑ Pi ,l ⋅ ∑ BWk
'

l =1

k =1

l' =1

(2)

k =1

where BWk denotes the effective-bandwidth [5].
When a new call arrives at Celli, which resource requirement is BW, its operation
strategy is represented by the following expression:
Available_BW_of_Celli> BW +∆BW

(3)

If the expression (4) holds, then the scheme admits the call, or else rejects it.
When m calls handoff to Celli while n calls terminate or handoff from Celli to other
cells, its strategy is represented by the following expression:
Available_BW_of_Celli>BWReserved

(4)

where BWReserved=∆BW(N1+m, N2+n)- ∆BW(N1, N2). If the expression (5) holds,
then the scheme admits the calls handoffing to Celli, and reserves resources for them
in advance, or else rejects the handoff requests.

5 Performance Analysis and Numerical Simulation
Our simulation network is a random Waxman-based network with 100 nodes (i.e.,
100 cells). For simple, assumed the call creates in Poisson random process with average arrival rate λ and holding-time µ-1, the total resource of each cell is 100 unit, and
the resource requirement of each call uniformly distributes in the range [1, 20] unit.
During the call lifetime, the trajectory of movement of mobile user is represented by
the trace of a sub-graph of 100-node Waxman network.

Fig. 5. The QoS performance of our proposed scheme compared with other schemes

Here, we evaluate our proposed scheme by the comparison with Fixed-percent and
ExpectedMax [4] from two aspects, i.e., the time-complexity, and the QoS performance which is depicted by the handoff dropping probability Phd, the new call blocking
probability Pnb, the reserved resource utilization, and the overall call blocking probability. For Fixed-percent, assumed that the reserved resource for handoff occupies
8% of total resource in each cell.
Fig.5(a) and (b) illustrates the performances of three schemes in the handoff dropping and the new call blocking. As expected, Phd and Pnb for the three schemes increase with the call arrival rate. But, both of Phd and Pnb in our proposed scheme is the
lowest, which benefits from the mobility prediction. Our proposed scheme considers
the mobility of user during the resource reservation, and the reservation operations
just aim at the predicted cells, i.e., MLC(Celli). Obviously, the resource waste due to

An Efficient Wireless Resource Allocation Based on a Data Compressor Predictor

525

the useless reservations in each cell is reduced. Therefore, Phd and Pnb can be improved.
The reserved resource utilization is illustrated in Fig.5(c). When λ<3.5, it will rise
sharply. But when λ>3.5, their distinctions will be more and more evident. In Fixedpercent, the reserved resource utilization will slowly rise and approach its limit 100%.
Contrarily in Predict-based and ExpectedMax, it will slightly decrease instead. It can
be explained as follows. When λ increases, the constant resource reserved exclusively
for the handoff process would be depleted, and cannot suffice the process of more
handoff events. Hence, the utilization rate of its reserved resource certainly reaches
100%. Predict-based and ExpectedMax reserve resource based on the mobility prediction. Moreover, these schemes exists some unavoidable prediction faults, which will
appear frequently, and so incur much more invalid reservation operations when λ
increases. Hence, it is impossible for Predict-based and ExpectedMax that the utilization rate is as high as Fixed-percent. As a whole, the utilization rate of Predict-based
is better that of ExpectedMax When λ is high. The advantage comes from the better
accuracy of mobility prediction based on Ziv-Lempel algorithm in Predict-based.
Obtained from the results in Ref. [8], the estimate of the overall call blocking probability in Celli can be expressed as follows

⎛ Load Cell
≥ C ) ≤ ⎜⎜

⎟ ⋅ e C − Load

(5)

where Load consists of the actual resource used by the existing calls in Celli, and the
reserved resource in Celli for some arriving calls. In the comparison of Fig. 6, we take
the upper bound. As illustrated by Fig. 5, when λ>3.5, our proposed scheme distinctly
outperforms Fixed-percent and ExpectedMax. Generally, the call arrival rate is more
than 3.5-call/second in actual wireless network. The result in Fig. 5 (d) shows that it
is significant for our proposed scheme to improve the overall call blocking.

As a whole, our proposed scheme will incur overhead as other schemes with mobility prediction. Here, we evaluate the overhead in terms of time-complexity. As
shown by Fig. 6, the relative time-complexities of Fixed-percent and ExpectedMax
are better than that of our proposed scheme. But when λ>3.5, the distinction between
Predict-based and ExpectedMax will be more and more blurring.

6 Conclusions
Due to the mobility uncertainty of mobile user, it is a real challenge for wireless
network to efficiently allocate and reserve resource. Firstly motivated from a
rationale, i.e., a good data compressor should be a good predictor, this paper develops
a mobility prediction algorithm based on the Ziv-Lempel algorithm, which is both
theoretically optimal and good in practice. Theoretically, the prediction algorithm can
predict not only to which cell a mobile user will handoff but also when the handoff
will occur. Then, we propose an efficient re-source allocation and reservation scheme,
called predict-based GC, which integrates the prediction algorithm into the guard
channels (GC) policy. The simulation results show that the time-complexity of our
proposed scheme (i.e., predict-based GC) is worse, but it outperforms Fixed-percent
and ExpectedMax in the QoS support effectiveness.
