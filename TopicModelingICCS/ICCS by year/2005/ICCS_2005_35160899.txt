Abstract. In this paper we develop a general Homotopy method called
the Group Homotopy method to solve the symmetric eigenproblem. The
Group Homotopy method overcomes notable drawbacks of the existing
Homotopy method, namely, (i) the possibility of breakdown or having a
slow rate of convergence in the presence of clustering of the eigenvalues
and (ii) the absence of any deﬁnite criterion to choose a step size that
guarantees the convergence of the method. On the other hand, the Group
Homotopy method maintains attractive features of the ordinary Homotopy method such as the natural parallelism and the structure preserving
properties.

Introduction

Let S and A be two real n × n symmetric matrices. Deﬁne a mapping H :
R −→ Mn such that H(t) = A(t) ≡ (1 − t)S + tA, t ∈ [0, 1]. Note that
A(t) = S + t(A − S) so that the matrix A(t) can be made close to S by
choosing t small enough. The objective is to obtain the set of all the eigenuk
pairs
, k = 1, . . . , n of A(1) = A by successively obtaining the set of
λk
uk (i)
eigenpairs
, k = 1, . . . , n of A(ti ), 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn = 1, startλk (i)
xk
ing from the set of eigenpairs
, k = 1, . . . , n of A(0) = S[1,2,3,6,7,8].
αk
The procedure is called the Homotopy method. A major problem that arises
in implementing a Homotopy method for the eigenproblem is: how to choose
∆ti ≡ ti+1 − ti properly so that the all eigenpairs of A(ti + ∆ti ) can be obtained
from the eigenpairs (possibly clustered) of A(ti ) using Newton’s method with
a reasonable number of iterations. In this paper we provide an answer to the
question. It is well known that there exists a small neighborhood of each eigenpair of A(ti+1 ) such that Newton’s method converges in the small neighborhood.

Thus the question is: how close should A(ti ) be to A(ti+1 ) to have a guarantee
that each eigenpair of A(ti ) is in that convergence neighborhood of the corresponding eigenpair of A(ti+1 ) under Newton’s method. [4] provides an answer
to above question whenever the eigenvalues of A(ti ) are not clustered. We deﬁne gap∗ (A(ti )) ≡ min{gapk (A(ti ))} where gapk (A(ti )) = |λk (i) − λk+1 (i)|, and
k

λk (i) are the eigenvalues of A(ti ) in decreasing order for k = 1, . . . , n − 1. We
gap∗ (A(ti ))
show that if ∆ti is chosen such that ∆ti ≤
for some q ≥ 4, then all
q
eigenpairs of A(ti ) will converge to the corresponding eigenpairs of A(ti + ∆ti )
under Newton’s method. The method will fail when gap∗ (A(ti )) becomes extremely small for some ti ∈ [0, 1), that is, the matrix A(ti ) has the clustered
eigenvalues. To overcome the problem we introduce the group gap, Gap∗ in section 2. It is noted that under the group gap we always obtain a suﬃciently large
step size ∆ti so that the Homotopy method terminates in a ﬁnite number of
steps. We also discuss problems that may occur due to the large step size ∆ti
when the Newton’s method is applied to obtain the successive eigenpairs. We
show in section 3 that this problem can be easily resolved by a simple modiﬁcation of the Newton’s method. The new Homotopy method with group gap,
Gap∗ is called the Group Homotopy method. The Group Homotopy method
with the parameterized Newton’s iteration never fails and is guaranteed to give
all eigenpairs of A in a ﬁnite number of steps. Furthermore, the choice of the
initial matrix S can be arbitrary even though a good choice of the initial matrix
will facilitate the convergence. An algorithm of the Group Homotopy method is
presented in section 3.

Properties of the Group Homotopy Method

In this section we develop a method called the Group Homotopy method which
is a generalization of the Individual Homotopy Method. This is done to overcome
the diﬃculties that arise in the Individual Homotopy method. Assume that an
arbitrary real symmetric matrix S ∈ Mn is chosen as the initial matrix. As we
have observed previously, the Individual Homotopy method fails whenever the
gap between some adjacent eigenvalues of the matrix A(ti ) becomes quite small.
This situation may occur when some eigenvalues of A(ti ) are clustered, i.e., there
are groups of a consecutive eigenvalues in which the distance between any two
groups is much larger than the gaps among the eigenvalues that belong to the
same group. We resolve the diﬃculty by using a concept, called the group gap.
For that purpose, we deﬁne the clustering of eigenvalues as follows:
Definition 1. Let σ(A) = {λi }i=1,...,n be the set of eigenvalues of a symmetric
matrix A in decreasing order. We say that two adjacent eigenvalues λk and λk+1
are clustered if |λk − λk+1 | < Gap∗ , 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 where Gap∗ is a given positive
number.

Definition 2. We say that a subset G = {λk , λk+1 , . . . , λk+m } ⊆ σ(A) is a
group of clustering of eigenvalues if |λk+i −λk+i+1 | < Gap∗ for all i = 0, . . . , m−
1 where |λk−1 − λk | ≥ Gap∗ and |λk+m − λk+m+1 | ≥ Gap∗ .
Now we deﬁne the Group Homotopy Method. Let S and A be given real n×n
symmetric matrices such that S is the initial matrix and A is the target matrix.
Then A(ti+1 ) = A(ti ) + ∆ti (A − S) where 0 ≤ t0 < t1 < . . . < tn = 1,
∆ti = ti+1 − ti , A(t0 ) = S and A(tn ) = A.
Definition 3. We say a Homotopy method is the Group Homotopy method if
the step size ∆ti is determined by Gap∗ .
Before we develop the Group Homotopy method we make the following brief
remarks.
Remarks

gap∗ (A(ti ))
in the Indiq
vidual Homotopy are determined completely by the eigenvalues of A(ti ) where
the eigenpath of the Homotopy is determined a’priori by the initial matrix S.
On the other hand Gap∗ in the Group Homotopy is a constant that we are free
to choose to group the eigenvalues of A(ti ) so that the resulting stepsize ∆ti is
large enough.
(A)Advantages of using Gap∗ : The stepsize ∆ti =

(B) How to choose Gap∗ : For the choice of Gap∗ , one can consider the following: (1) the dimension of matrices involved, (2) magnitude of the eigenvalues of
matrices involved, and (3) the nearness of the initial matrix to the target matrix.
Furthermore, a good choice of Gap∗ should be the one that can be computed
easily while providing a large enough step size for the Homotopy method to terminate in a reasonable amount of time. The following choice of Gap∗ is used in
this paper: Gap∗ = δ A − S = δ A − S , δ > 0 where · is a matrix norm.
(C) Justification of the choice Gap∗ = δ A − S : We will justify our choice
of Gap∗ and show how it leads to a simple determination of ∆ti . For some posn

itive scalars c1 and c2 , we have

where αk ’s and λk ’s are the eigenvalues of the matrices S and A, respectively.
Thus, δ A − S measures overall nearness of the initial eigenvalues to the target
eigenvalues. It also implicitly considers the eigenvectors of both matrices A and

clustering eigenvalues contains all eigenvalues of A(ti ) in the Group Homotopy.

Suppose the eigenvalues of A(ti ) are partitioned as groups of clustering eigenvalues; σ(A(ti )) = ∪gk=1 Gk , where Gk = {λk1 (i) ≥ · · · ≥ λksk (i)} is a group of
clustering eigenvalues of A(ti ), s1 + · · · + sg = n. We partition the eigenvalues of
A(ti+1 ) conformally to form the groups correspond to the grouping in σ(A(ti )),
σ(A(ti+1 )) = ∪gk=1 Gk , where Gk = {λk1 (i + 1) ≥ · · · ≥ λksk (i + 1)}, s1 + · · · +
sg = n. We call Gk the counterpart of Gk .

Implications of Theorem 5: Suppose that two successive matrices A(ti ) and
A(ti+1 ) are obtained via group gap Gap∗ in the process of the Group Homotopy.
Then the statement (i) asserts that the jth eigenvalue in a group G ⊆ σ(A(ti+1 ))

is for a large enough q > 0, the eigenvalues can change only a small amount
between two successive steps of the Group Homotopy method.
Statement (ii) shows that there is a big enough gap between the eigenvalues
in G and the eigenvalues that are not in the counterpart G . Thus we see that
the eigenvalues in G are more likely to converge to the eigenvalues in G under
the Newton iteration. From the statement (iii) we see that for a large enough
q > 0 there is a gap between any two G ’s in σ(A(ti+1 )) that are counterparts
of groups in σ(A(ti )). Thus a group of the clustered eigenvalues tends to remain
as a group of the clustered eigenvalues during the Group Homotopy.

Group Homotopy Algorithm

Now we prove the main result of the Group Homotopy with the parameterized
Newton’s iteration. In the following we let σ(A(ti )) = {α1 , . . . , αn }, αn ≤ · · · ≤
α1 and σ(A(ti+1 )) = {λ1 , . . . , λn }, λn ≤ · · · ≤ λ1 for the notational convenience.

Numerical Results. Since · 2 ≤ · F where · F is the Frobenius matrix
norm and · F is easy to compute, we use A − S F to compute ∆ti in the
following examples. Let M = the number of eigenpairs obtained using the modiﬁed Newton iteration. B = the number of eigenpairs recovered with modiﬁed

number of iterations at each step. D = the maximum number of iterations needed
for the orthogonalization.
Example 1: Consider the matrix
A = [aij ], ∈ Mn , aij = i if i > j, aij = (−1)i 3 ∗ i if i = j, aij = j if j > i.
Choose the initial matrix S such that A(0) = S = diag(a11 , a22 , . . . , ann ).
A − A(0) F = 1779.2. The result of Table 1 uses q = 4. From the results of
numerical experiments below, it is clear that if q is large then the number of
iterations in each step is signiﬁcantly lower (see last row of each table) and also
the number of eigenpairs recovered using algorithm 3.1 (Step 4) is also less (row
representing B).
Since Gap∗ < gap∗ (S), we choose ∆t = 1. It shows that the choice of S is
very important to accomplish the experiment in an eﬃcient way.

Conclusions

We have presented a new Homotopy method, called the Group Homotopy method
for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix. The
important features of this method are:
(i) Unlike the other methods for symmetric eigenvalue problem, the new method
does not transform the initial matrix to a tridiagonal matrix, and is thus
suitable for large and sparse problems.
(ii) The method can take advantage of the structure preserving linear systems
solvers, especially designed for structure matrices, such as Toeplitz. Thus
the method is expected to be much faster than the existing methods in most
cases.
(iii) Unlike the other existing Homotopy methods, the step-size is predetermined
at the outset according to a criterion presented in the paper and is never
altered at any iteration during the execution of the algorithm.
(iv) The algorithm is parallel in nature.
