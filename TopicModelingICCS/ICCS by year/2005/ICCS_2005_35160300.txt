Abstract. In this paper a two-dimensional simulation of organic light emitting
devices (OLEDs) using an adaptive computing technique is presented. A set of
drift-diffusion equations including models of interface traps is solved numerically to explore the transport property of OLED structures. The adaptive simulation technique is mainly based on the Gummel's decoupling algorithm, a finite
volume approximation, a monotone iterative method, a posteriori error estimation, and an unstructured meshing scheme. With this computational approach,
we investigate the intrinsic and terminal voltage-current characteristics of
OLEDs with respect to different material parameters, thickness of materials,
and length of structure.

1 Introduction
Organic electroluminescence has been of great interest in various display applications.
Organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays are lightweight, durable, power efficient and ideal for portable applications [1]. They have lower material costs and fewer
processing steps than their liquid crystal display (LCD) counterparts. As such, the
OLED display appears to be a strong candidate as a replacement technology in a variety of mobile application areas. OLEDs with different thin-film structures, consisting
of emitter and carrier transport layers, have recently been reported [2], [3], [4], [5],
[6]. According to the simple device geometry in OLEDs, one-dimensional (1D) transport model, the drift-diffusion model, has generally been solved along the transport
direction for studying the electrical properties of OLEDs [4], [5], [6]. However, a
multidimensional modeling and simulation plays a crucial role for exploring the effect
of device structure and material on the electrical characteristics of OLEDs.
In this paper a set of drift-diffusion (DD) equations is solved with an adaptive
computing technique [7], [8], [9], [10] for a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of
OLEDs. For the simulation of OLEDs, the DD equations consist of the Poisson equation, the current continuity equation of electron, the current continuity equation of
hole, and models of interface traps. First of all we decouple the three partial differential equations (PDEs) according to the Gummel’s procedure. Based on adaptive unstructured mesh and finite volume (FV) approximation, each decoupled PDE is discretized and then solved by means of the monotone iterative (MI) method instead of

Newton’s iteration (NI) method. The method of monotone iteration is a constructive
alternative for numerical solutions of PDEs. It has been reported that, compared with
the NI method, the major features of the MI method are (1) it converges globally with
any arbitrary initial guesses; (2) its implementation is much easier than NI method;
and (3) it is inherently ready for parallelization [8]. Furthermore, due to the efficient
posteriori error estimation, the variation of physical quantities, such as the gradients
of potential and current density, can be automatically tracked. Therefore, the terminal
characteristics are accurately calculated. The proposed adaptive computing technique
shows the simulation accuracy and numerical robustness for the simulation of 2D
OLEDs. Effects of geometry, the trap density and the Schottky barrier height [11] on
the current-voltage (I-V) curves of the simulated 2D OLED are examined using the
developed 2D simulation program.
This paper is organized as follows. In the section 2, we state the transport model
and the adaptive computing technique for the 2D simulation of OLED. In the section
3, the results of numerical simulation are discussed. Finally we draw the conclusions.

2 Mathematical Model and Computational Methodology
Based on the well-known inorganic charge transport continuum model [9], the driftdiffusion model, electron and hole transport in the OLED is described using the current continuity equations coupled to the Poisson equation [11]. Along with the appropriate boundary conditions, which for OLEDs require appropriate formalisms for
current injection at each of the contacts, these equations are solved to obtain solutions
for the electrostatic potential, electric field, carrier densities, and current densities for
electron and hole, respectively. The investigated 2D structure of OLED, shown in Fig.
1, is a TPD/Alq3 two-layer device. Modeling of traps in numerical simulation of
OLEDs is widely debated [3]. The electron-hole mobility taking the field-dependent
Poole-Frenkel form in the current continuity equations of electron and hole is for
shallow trapping of carriers. For deep traps, an extra recombination term and inclusion of their charge in the Poisson equation are considered. Deep traps can be described by a discrete and exponential distribution. The simulated OLED is based on
the 2D structure of the tris-(8-hydoroxyquinoline)-aluminum (Alq3) for the layer of
electron transport and the triphenyl-diamine (TPD) for the layer of hole transport. As

shown in Fig. 1, we assume the length of anode (LA) is equal to 20 nm, the length of
cathode (LX) is equal to 400 nm, and the thicknesses of Alq3 layer (Ly1) and TPD
layer (Ly2) are equal to 40 nm, respectively. We solve the steady-state DD model [1114], which consists of

In Eq. (1), ψ is the electrostatic potential, ε is the dielectric constant, N A and N D
are the densities of acceptor and donor, nt and pt are the densities of trapped electrons
and holes, respectively. Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is adopted for the electron and
hole densities. In Eqs. (2) and (3) G is the electron and hole generation rate and the
carrier generation by thermal excitation across the gap is assumed. Two carrier recombination rates, the optical recombination rate Ropt and the Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination rate Rsrh are assumed in the simulation [11]. We consider here the
densities of trapped electrons and holes for the jth trap level

where Ntj (Ptj) is the electron (hole) trap density, Etj is the trap energy relative to the
conduction band edge, g is the trap degeneracy, and Efn (Efp) is the electron (hole)
quasi-Fermi level. Boundary conditions are assumed for the DD model above [11-14].
In the solution procedure, the adaptive computing is mainly based on the Gummel’s decoupling algorithm, the FV approximation, the MI method, a posteriori error
estimation, and an unstructured meshing technique. This simulation methodology has
been developed in our recent work for semiconductor device simulation [7], [8], [9],
[10]. Each Gummel decoupled PDE is approximated with the FV method over unstructured meshes. The corresponding system of nonlinear algebraic equations of the
FV approximated PDE is solved with the MI method and the posteriori error estimation scheme is applied to assess the quality of computed solutions. It has been shown
that the method of MI converges monotonically [8]. The adaptive mechanism is based
on an estimation of the gradient of computed solutions, such as the electrostatic potential, the carrier density, and the current density. A posteriori error estimation is

applied to provide local error indicators for incorporation into the mesh refinement
strategy. The local error indicators guide the adaptive refinement process.

3 Results and Discussion
In this section we first present the computational efficiency of the method by solving the
OLED under a given biasing condition. The applied anode voltage and cathode voltage
on the OLED are 10 V and 0 V, respectively, and the barrier height on the contact is
assumed to be 0.3 eV. For this testing case, the obtained initial and final refined meshes
are shown in Fig. 2. The stopping criteria for the MI and Gummel’s loops are 10-6 and
10-3, respectively. The initial mesh has 153 nodes and the final one consists of 1681
nodes. The adaptive computing process includes 5 refinement levels, which shows the
computational efficiency. Different simulation cases are further performed to explore
the intrinsic and terminal electrical characteristics of the OLEDs.

We note that the simulation of OLEDs require the input of accurate material parameters, such as density of state, barrier height, and carrier mobility. However, unlike the
case for inorganic semiconductor devices, these material parameters are often poorly
characterized and are strongly dependent upon the fabricated samples. Our selection of
the material parameters provides only the starting point for the electrical simulation of
OLEDs. Good agreement between simulation and measurement should be subject to
further calibration. Contour plots of the electrostatic potential and the electron density
are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively, where the OLED under two different biasing
conditions the anode voltage is equal to 10.0V and 0 V, are simulated. The cathode
voltage is fixed at 0.0V and the barrier height of contact varies from 0.3 eV to 1.2 eV

with step 0.3 eV. The unit of the color bars, shown in Fig. 3, is in Volt. The computed
electrostatic potential significantly shows the importance of selection of barrier height.
Different barrier heights imply different current injection. The unit of the color bars of
electron density is with per meter cubic. Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the necessary for
the advanced design of OLED structures by using a 2D simulation.

To explore the effect of trap density on the transport characteristics, we simulate
the current-voltage (I-V) curves with respect to different electron trap densities, where
the hole trap density is neglected. As shown in Fig. 5, the I-V curves per unit area are
calculated with different densities of traps which range from 1010 cm-2 to 1013 cm-2.
The anode voltage is equal to 10 V and the barrier height is fixed at 0.3 eV. It is found
that the higher electron trap densities get no significant benefit to improve the electrical performance of the OLED. The choice of OLED’s contacts is crucial, and it af-

fects the minority and majority currents, the recombination rates, and the efficiency.
At the interface of metal and semiconductor of OLED, the variation of barrier heights
is wide. The operation of OLED depends upon the asymmetry of the barrier heights at
the two contacts, shown in Fig. 1; ITO is one of the preferred anode materials due to
the transparency and relatively high work function. Metal, such as Al, Ca, or Mg, with
low work functions is selected as cathode material. To explore the effect of the Schottky barrier height on the I-V relationships [11], the Schottky barrier height on the
contacts is simply varied from 0.0 to 1.2 eV, shown in Fig. 6.

With the 2D simulation, the lateral length and thickness of transport layer are
changed for exploring the I-V curves. It is found that small Lx produces high current
level when the Ly1 and Ly2 are fixed, shown in Fig. 7. Due to uniform distribution of
electric fields, the small variation on Ly1 and Ly2 does not significantly alter the level
of current.

4 Conclusions
In this paper we have successfully applied adaptive computing technique to solve the
2D DD model for the simulation of electrical characteristics of OLEDs. Effects of the
carrier traps and device geometry on the transport properties have been studied. The
2D macroscopic modeling and simulation is a starting point for theoretical investigation of electrical characteristics of OLEDs. It benefits the design of structure and
optimization of characteristics. Application of technology computer-aided design
software to modern display industry requires accurate modeling and calibration of
material parameters. In contrast to the macroscopic simulation, we believe that microscopic approaches will physically provide accurate calculation.
