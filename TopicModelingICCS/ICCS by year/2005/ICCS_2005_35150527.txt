Abstract. Handover is one of the most important factors that may degrade the performance of TCP connections and real-time applications in
wireless data networks. We developed a loss-free handover scheme called
LPM (Last Packet Marking) for IEEE 802.16e-based broadband wireless access networks. By integrating MAC and network layer handovers
eﬃciently, LPM minimizes the handover delay and eliminates packet
losses during handover. Our performance study shows that LPM achieves
loss-free packet delivery without packet duplication and increases TCP
throughput signiﬁcantly.

Introduction

At present, existing WLAN has several limitations such as narrow transmission coverage and the interference problem caused by using the ISM (Industrial,
Scientiﬁc, Medical) band. In order to achieve a higher date rate and wider cell
range, the IEEE committee initiated a project 802.16 which standardizes a WBA
(Wireless Broadband Access) technologies. The 802.16 project [1] ﬁrst speciﬁed
the MAC and physical layers of broadband ﬁxed wireless access system over the
10-66 GHz band. It provides up to several tens of Mbps by using ﬁxed antennas
and ﬁxed MSS (Mobile Subscriber Station) in urban and suburban areas. In addition, the IEEE 802.16a [2] modiﬁes the MAC physical layer speciﬁcations that
facilitates the non-line-of-sight communications over the 2-11 GHz. Furthermore,
the baseline speciﬁcation is now being amended again for mobility enhancement
(60km/h) under IEEE 802.16 TGe Mobile Wireless MAN [3], which also deals
with transmission power control and power saving.
Compared to wired transmission systems, wireless systems suﬀer from limited bandwidth and error-prone transmissions. In addition, packet losses and
service disruptions may occur during cell HOs (Handovers) in cellular networks.

For the TCP, in particular, lost packets during HO severely degrade the TCP
performance because of the sensitivity of the TCP mechanism for packet loss.
The TCP retransmits the lost packets and slows down its transmission rate.
Even worse, when multiple packets are lost during one congestion window, TCP
senders enter into the slow-start phase and decrease the packet sending rate
severely.
In this paper, we propose a seamless HO scheme called LPM (Last Packet
Marking) for intra-domain mobility in IEEE 802.16e-based broadband wireless
packet networks. LPM merges MAC and network layer HO procedures to reduce
HO time and assures a safe HO by preparing the routing update before the real
HO.
This paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we brieﬂy preview the
IEEE 802.16 TGe HO procedure and overview the micro-mobility protocols. In
section 3, we describe a LPM method for seamless HO on IEEE 802.16e-based
wireless broadband access networks. Then, we verify the LPM through computer
simulations and present the conclusions in section 5.

Background
IEEE 802.16 TGe Handover

Let us explain the IEEE 802.16 TGe HO procedure brieﬂy. A BS periodically
broadcasts a neighbor advertisement management message to identify the network and deﬁne the characteristics of the neighbor BS to associated MSS (Mobile Service Station). An MSS may decode this message to ﬁnd out information
about the parameters of the neighbor BS. Each MSS will thus be able to scan
the neighbor BS and measure the signal strength. If necessary, an MSS may
select neighbor BS and prepare for the future HO by performing ranging and association procedures. Through ranging, the MSS can acquire the timing, power
and frequency adjustment information of the neighbor BS. The target BS-MSS
association information is reported to the serving BS.
The MAC layer (L2) HO is divided into two phases; the HO pre-registration
phase and the real HO phase. During HO pre-registration, the target BS is selected and pre-registered with the MSS. However, the connection to the currently
serving BS is maintained and packets may exchanged during the pre-registration
phase. In the real HO, MSS releases the serving BS and re-associates with the
target BS.
Now, let’s look into the HO procedure in greater detail. Either an MSS or
a serving BS may initiate the HO pre-registration. When the MSS initiates the
HO pre-registration, it may indicate a possible target BS from a signal-quality
point of view. After the MSS or the serving BS initiates HO pre-registration,
the serving BS may acquire information from the neighbor BS regarding their
capability of serving the requesting MSS. The serving BS may further notify the
neighbor BS (through the backbone) of the impending HO. Fig. 1 shows an
example of MAC layer HO call ﬂow initiated by the MSS [3]. After receiving the

an HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response, which include ACK or NACK of impending HO
for the MSS. Then, the serving BS selects the target BS and sends an HO-RSP
message, including the target BS-ID, to the MSS. The MSS shall transmit an
HO-IND message for ﬁnal indication that it is about to perform a real HO. After
the HO pre-registration phase, the real HO procedure is started. The serving BS
releases the MSS and the MSS synchronizes with the target BS. Thereafter
reauthorization and re-establishment of IP connectivity are taken.

Micro Mobility Protocols

At present, there are many eﬀorts underway to provide Internet services on
integrated wireless and wired networks. Supporting an eﬃcient IP mobility is
one of the major issues in constructing IP-based wireless access networks. Mobile
users will expect the same level of service quality as wired network users. Even
though the serving BS of the mobile user changes, IP connections should be
continuously maintained transparently. The Mobile Internet Protocol [4] is the
current standard for supporting global IP mobility in a simple and scalable
manner. However, Mobile IP is targeted for static mobility support where a
service continuation is not guaranteed.
A number of solutions like Cellular IP , HAWAII , Hierarchical Mobile IP
that support dynamic mobility or cellular networking have been proposed. These
approaches aimed to extend Mobile IP rather than to replace it. In order to
handle the local movement of mobile hosts without interaction with the MobileIP-enabled Internet, they have adopted a domain-based approach. These intradomain protocols are used for establishing and exchanging the state information

inside the wireless access networks, so as to get fast and eﬃcient intra-domain
mobility or micro-mobility control.

A Seamless Handover Mechanism - LPM
Wireless Access Network Model

The broadband wireless access network model that we propose uses a routingbased scheme for micro-mobility. The domain is formed by PARs (Packet Access
Routers) and BSs (Fig. 2) in a tree structure and is connected to the Internet
through the domain root PAR. The BSs use IEEE 802.16e for its wireless interface. For global mobility, the MSS is registered with the address of the gateway
PAR on the HA (Home Agent). In the local domain, the MSS is identiﬁed by
the IP address it uses in its home network. Each PAR maintains the routing
cache in a soft-state manner through the periodic routing update information
and upward data packets sent by MSSs.

Proposed Seamless Hanover Protocol

In order to provide seamless mobility, the MAC layer (L2) HO and network layer
(L3) HO should be integrated to minimize the impact on service performance.
If the L3 HO is started after the L2 HO has been done, the IP connectivity
should be broken for the time being until it is re-established. As a result, packet
loss is inevitable. In our scheme, the L3 HO and L2 HO procedure progress
concurrently so as to minimize HO time.
Each BS has BS-ID to BS-IP address mapping table of neighbor BSs in
network initiation time. The proposed HO procedure is described in Fig. 3, in
which the added procedures to the IEEE 802.16 TGe document are shown in
bold and italic. Either the BS or the MSS can initiate HO. Then, the serving BS
sends an HO-pre-notiﬁcation (1) to the candidate target BS. The destination IP

serving BS. The MSS IP address should be added to the original message.

When the target BS receives an HO-pre-notiﬁcation message, it decides
whether or not to accept this MSS for HO. Then, it sends an HO-pre-notiﬁcationresponse with ACK or NACK to the serving BS. When ACK is the response, the
pre-routing update message is sent towards the gateway (2). The sender address
of the pre-routing update is the IP address of the impending HO MSS. By prerouting update message, a routing entry in the routing cache of PARs is added
in the path through the target BS to cross-over PAR, which is the branching
ancestor of the serving BS and the target BS. Then, the target BS prepares the
buﬀer for the MSS (3), which assures the removal of packet loss during L2 HOs.
When the crossover PAR receives the pre-routing update message, it bi-casts
the data packets toward the MSS in the direction of both the serving and target
BSs (4). The PAR that receives the pre-routing update can know whether it is
a crossover or not by looking up the routing cache. If another diﬀerent routing
entry for the MSS is in the cache, then it is a crossover PAR. After the serving
BS receives the HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response (5), it exchanges HO-RSP (6) /
HO-IND (7) with the MSS, including the target BS information. Then, the MSS
starts the real HO. After the real HO, including ranging and association with the
target BS (9), the MSS ﬁrst sends the routing update message (10) towards the
gateway to stop bi-casting of the crossover PAR. Then, the target BS forwards
the buﬀered data for the MSS (11). After that, the MSS can continue its normal
packet communication. In the proposed mechanism, the data packets received
from the serving BS after the HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response can also be received
through the target BS. This is because the crossover PAR bi-casts the data packets just after receiving the HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response and pre-routing update.
Thus, the HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response signals the time point, after which the
data packets for the MSS are prepared on the target BS buﬀer. We termed our

532

K.-a. Kim, C.-K. Kim, and T. Kim

proposal as LPM (Last Packet Marking), since the HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response
indicates that last packet before bi-casting has been received through the serving
BS.
In cases where several target BSs send the HO-pre-notiﬁcation-response with
ACK, many crossover PARs bi-cast the data packets. At every bi-casting, just
one mapping to the new leaf BS (just one downward link) is attached to the
routing cache in the crossover PAR. The ﬁnal routing tree is a subset tree of
the full tree of wireless access networks. That is, in the worst case, where the
serving BS sends the HO-pre-notiﬁcation to all BSs in the access network, all BSs
can receive data packets for the MSS after HOs. But after the routing update
timeout, only the routing entry on the path that the MSS is attached to remains.
When the MSS postpones the real HO after receiving the HO-pre-notiﬁcationresponse, then the bi-casted packets should be received through the serving BS
and also through the target BS, which results for the MSS to receive duplicated
packets. Thus, the target BS should ﬁlter out the duplicated packets. However,
the IP layer doesn’t know the TCP sequence number. So, when the MSS sends
the routing update just after the real HO, the information on the last packet
received from the serving BS before the real HO can be sent to the target BS.
The information is the resulting value of the hash function of (IP Header +
Fixed Size IP Payload). When the target BS receives this hash value, it then
ﬁnds the matched packet in the buﬀer and only forwards the following packets
to the MSS to ﬁlter out the duplicated packets.

Simulation
Simulation Details

We used the micro-mobility extension for the ns-2 network simulator based on
version 2.1b6. Since IEEE 802.16e is not yet implemented in ns2, we emulated
it using an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. When no other MSS are contending for
wireless resources, the MSS can stably communicate with the BS like in IEEE
802.16e. HO-pre-notiﬁcation and response were exchanged between the serving
and target BSs.
The simulation topology is shown in Fig. 4. The wireless access network is
formed with PAR0-PAR5 and the BSs. The TCP source is CN (Correspondent
Node) and the receiver is the MSS. All wired links in the access network are
10 Mb/s duplex links with a 5-ms delay. The CN and gateway (PAR0) link is
set to 10 Mb/s duplex link with a 50-ms delay. MSS connects to BS using the
ns-2 CSMA/CA 2Mb/s wireless link model. The link layer HO delay is set to
15 ms. An MSS starts the TCP connection with CN at time 3 and oscillates
between BS1 and BS5 at a constant speed from time 5. The MH stays for about
10 seconds before moving to the next BS. The TCP Tahoe is used for TCP
mechanism. The TCP window size is set to 20 and the packet size is 1024 Bytes.

Figure 5 shows the TCP connection throughput as a function of time. The TCP
throughput is measured every 1 second. We call the basic HO scheme as hard
HO, in which L3 HO is started after the real HO. All hard HOs have abrupt
glitches caused by lost packets. It is well known that a packet loss decreases the
TCP performance signiﬁcantly due to the TCP congestion control. On the other
hand, LPM shows no throughput drops on any HO.

The sender and receiver packet traces of the TCP connection from BS1 to
BS2 HO is shown in Fig. 6. All other HO traces showed similar results. In hard
HO, the real HO started at time 16.138 and ﬁnished at 16.155. Then, the L3 HO
(routing update) is done from 16.155 to 16.172. The network layer HO time is
proportional to the round-trip time from BS2 to crossover PAR (PAR3). TCP
packet 1714 through 1718 was lost during this period. TCP restarts with slowstart from packet number 1714. But in LPM, no packet loss was observed. The
HO-pre-notiﬁcation message was sent at 16.134 and the response was received
at 16.155. Real HO starts at 16.173 and ends at 16.188. During 16.155 to 16.173
the MSS receives bi-casted packets (1714 and 1718) from the serving BS. After

target BS ﬁltered out packets below 1719 to remove duplicate packets by hash
value, included in the routing update from the MSS. Then, the BS forwarded
the packets from 1719 to the MSS.

Conclusions

We have proposed a new handover scheme called LPM (Last Packet Marking)
for micro-mobility in IEEE 802.16e-based broadband wireless packet networks.
Through LPM, MAC and network layer handover procedures were done simultaneously to minimize the handover time. We studied the performance of LPM
using computer simulation. Our simulation study showed that LPM is free from
packet loss and duplication.
