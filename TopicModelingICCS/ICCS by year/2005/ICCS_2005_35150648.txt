Abstract. The task of providing an optimal analysis of the state of the
atmosphere requires the development of dynamic data-driven systems
(d3 as) that eﬃciently integrate the observational data and the models.
In this paper we discuss fundamental aspects of nonlinear ensemble data
assimilation applied to atmospheric chemical transport models. We formulate autoregressive models for the background errors and show how
these models are capable of capturing ﬂow dependent correlations. Total energy singular vectors describe the directions of maximum errors
growth and are used to initialize the ensembles. We highlight the challenges encountered in the computation of singular vectors in the presence
of stiﬀ chemistry and propose solutions to overcome them. Results for a
large scale simulation of air pollution in East Asia illustrate the potential of nonlinear ensemble techniques to assimilate chemical observations.
Keywords: Dynamic data-driven applications and systems (d3 as), data
assimilation, background covariance, ensemble Kalman ﬁlter, total energy singular vectors, autoregressive processes.

atmosphere. As our fundamental understanding of atmospheric chemistry advances, novel data assimilation tools are needed to integrate observational data
and models together to provide the best, physically consistent estimate of the
evolving chemical state of the atmosphere. Data assimilation is vital for meteorological forecasting and has started to be applied in chemical transport modeling
[7, 10, 20, 24].
In this paper we focus on the particular challenges that arise in the application
of nonlinear ensemble ﬁlter data assimilation to atmospheric chemical transport
models (CTMs). The distinguishing feature of CTMs is the presence of nonlinear
and stiﬀ chemical interactions occurring at characteristic time scales that are
typically much shorter than the transport time scales. CTMs propagate the
model state forward in time from the “initial” state x(t0 ) to the “ﬁnal” state
x(tF ) (1). Perturbations (small errors) evolve according to the tangent linear
model (2) and adjoint variables according to the adjoint model (3):
x(tF ) = Mt0 →tF (x(t0 ))
δx(tF ) = Mt0 →tF δx(t0 )
λ(t0 ) = Mt∗F →t0 λ(tF ) .

(1)
(2)
(3)

Here M, M , and M ∗ denote the solution operators of the CTM, the tangent
linear, and the adjoint models respectively. The error covariance matrix evolves
from P (t0 ) to P (tF ) according to
P (tF ) = Mt0 →tF P (t0 ) Mt∗F →t0 + Q ,

(4)

where Q is the covariance of the model errors.
Kalman ﬁlter techniques [16] provide a stochastic approach to the data assimilation problem. The ﬁltering theory is described in Jazwinski [15] and the
applications to atmospheric modeling in [6, 19]. The computational burden associated to the ﬁltering process has prevented the implementation of the full
Kalman ﬁlter for large-scale transport-chemistry models. Ensemble Kalman ﬁlter techniques [8, 9, 13] may be used to facilitate the practical implementation
as shown by van Loon et al. [24].
In the ensemble implementation of the Kalman ﬁlter [9] the statistics are represented by the ensemble mean and covariance. These statistics depend strongly
on the background (initial) ensemble statistics x(t0 ) and P (t0 ). Since the probability density of the background state is not known exactly, it needs to be modeled. Previous eﬀorts to develop ﬂow dependent background covariance models
are due to Riishojgaard [21], Hamill et al. [11], Houtekamer et. al. [14], and
Buehner et. al. [1].
This paper brings the following new elements:
1. The background errors are modeled using autoregressive processes. Such
models are computationally inexpensive and capture the error correlations
along the ﬂow lines.
2. Total energy singular vectors (TESVs) are calculated for chemically reactive
ﬂows. TESVs are the directions of maximum error growth over a ﬁnite time
interval.

3. The above techniques are used to initialize the ensembles in a large scale
data assimilation problem.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background error
models and the calculation of TESVs. Section 3 illustrates the use of the tools
in a large scale data assimilation test, and Section 4 summarizes the results of
this research.

Construction of the Initial Ensemble

A good approximation of the background error statistics and a correct initialization of the ensemble are essential for the success of ensemble data assimilation.
In this section we consider autoregressive models for background errors and discuss the construction of TESVs. A more detailed discussion can be found in [5]
and [18].
2.1

Modeling the Background Errors

The background state xB is represented as the sum of the average state xB
plus an error (uncertainty) ﬁeld δxB , xB = xB + δxB . The error ﬁeld has zero
T
mean δxB = 0, and background covariance B = δxB δxB
. Our basic
assumption is that the background state errors form a multilateral autoregressive
(AR) process [12] of the form
B
B
B
δxB
i,j,k = α±1 δxi±1,j,k + β±1 δxi,j±1,k + γ±1 δxi,j,k±1 + σi,j,k ξi,j,k .

(5)

Here (i, j, k) are gridpoint indices on a 3 dimensional (structured) grid. The
model (5) captures the correlations among neighboring grid points, with α, β ,γ
representing the correlation coeﬃcients in the x, y and z directions respectively.
The last term represents the additional uncertainty at each grid point, with
ξ ∈ N (0, 1) normal random variables and σ local error variances. The motivation
behind multilateral AR models is the fact that (5), – with proper coeﬃcients –
can be regarded as a ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation of the advection-diﬀusion
equation.
The AR process (5) can be represented compactly as
A δx = ξ .

(6)

Note that A is a very sparse matrix. The background error covariance matrix is
B = A−1 A−T , and the correlation matrix is D = diag(B)−1/2 Bdiag(B)−1/2 .
Constant correlation coeﬃcients α, β, γ imply ﬁxed spatial directional correlation whereas variable coeﬃcients may be used to capture ﬂow dependent
correlations. In this paper we use the scaled wind speeds u, v, and w as correlation coeﬃcients. For example, the correlation coeﬃcients in the x direction are
2
2
+ wi,j,k
). This approach leads
given by αi,j,k = ui,j,k / maxi,j,k ( u2i,j,k + vi,j,k
to very well conditioned covariance matrices B.

To illustrate the autoregressive models we consider the wind ﬁelds over East
Asia on 0 GMT, March 1st , 2001, corresponding to the Trace-P ﬁeld campaign
[3]. An autoregressive model (5) of background errors is constructed using ﬂow
dependent coeﬃcients (scaled wind velocities). Top views of the spatial correlations of the resulting uncertainty ﬁelds are shown in Figure 1 for several
gridpoints located on the ground layer (a) and on the top layer (b). The correlations match the shape and magnitude of the wind ﬁeld. Note that the wind
speed near the ground is smaller than at the top and this is reﬂected by the
correlations.

Total Energy Singular Vectors

Total energy singular vectors (TESVs) are the directions of the most rapidly
growing perturbations over a ﬁnite time interval. We measure the magnitude of
the perturbations in the concentration ﬁelds using L2 (“energy”) norms. The
ratio between perturbation energies at the ﬁnal (tF ) and initial time (t0 ) oﬀers
a measure of error growth:
σ2 =

δx(tF )
δx(t0 )

2
B
2
A

=

δx(t0 ), Mt∗F →t0 BMt0 →tF δx(t0 )
δx(t0 ), Aδx(t0 )

(7)

Here A is a positive deﬁnite and B a positive semideﬁnite matrix. In (7) we
use the fact that perturbations evolve in time according to the dynamics of the
tangent linear model (2). TESVs are deﬁned as the directions of maximal error
growth, i.e. the vectors sk (t0 ) that maximize the ratio σ 2 in equation (7). These
directions are the solutions of the following generalized eigenvalue problem:
Mt∗F →t0 B Mt0 →tF sk (t0 ) = σk2 A sk (t0 )

(8)

The left side of (8) involves one integration with the tangent linear model followed
by one integration with the adjoint model.
The eigenvalue problem (8) is solved by software packages like ARPACK
[17] using Lanczos iterations. The symmetry of the matrix M ∗ B M required by

652

A. Sandu et al.

Lanczos imposes to use the discrete adjoint M ∗ of the tangent linear operator M
in (8). The computation of discrete adjoints for stiﬀ systems is a nontrivial task
[22]. In addition, computational errors (which can destroy symmetry) have to
be small. A considerable loss of symmetry during the stiﬀ transient is observed
in practice [18]. This is due to the fact that the initial perturbations are away
from the slow (non-stiﬀ) manifold. To correct this we apply the tangent linear
model on the initial perturbation for a short time, which is equivalent to “projecting” the initial perturbation onto the slow evolution manifold. In order to
preserve operator symmetry, another projection using the adjoint model needs
to be performed at the end of the adjoint integration. Consequently the matrixvector products are computed as w = Π ∗ Mt∗F →t0 B Mt0 →tF Π x, where Π and
Π ∗ denote the projection operations performed with the tangent linear and the
adjoint models respectively.

Numerical Results

The numerical tests use the state-of-the-art regional atmospheric chemical transport model STEM [3]. The simulation covers a region of 7200 Km × 4800 Km in
East Asia and uses a 30 × 20 × 18 computational grid with a horizontal resolution of 240 Km × 240 Km. The chemical mechanism is a variant of SAPRC-99 [4]
and accounts for 93 diﬀerent chemical species. The simulated conditions during
March 1st , 2001, correspond to the Trace-P [3]) ﬁeld experiment.
We consider artiﬁcial observations generated every 6 hours by a reference
simulation starting at 0 GMT, March 1st , 2001. The observations are ground
level ozone (O3 ) concentrations at 24 gridpoints over Japan, Korea, and East
China. These grid points are referred to as the “target area” (the gray area in
Figure 2).
For the calculation of TESVs the ﬁnal perturbation energy measures the
perturbations of (O3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) in the target area at the ﬁnal
time. The perturbation norm at the initial time accounts for perturbations in all
chemical species, scaled by typical concentration values [18]. The O3 and NO2
sections of the dominant TESV are shown in Figure 2. We notice that dominant
TESV is localized near the target area, and that it is strongly correlated with
the adjoint variable corresponding to a similar target function.
The data assimilation process uses an ensemble with 50 members. The ensemble is run for 6 hours in forecast mode, then is analyzed using the artiﬁcial
observations in the ensemble Kalman framework [9]. The assimilated ensemble
is then advanced in time for another 6 hours, then analyzed again, etc. until the
end of the 24 hours simulation interval.
Diﬀerent initial perturbations are considered as follows. The ﬁrst simulation
(“D”) uses an uncorrelated background. The initial perturbation is of the form
δxB = 30% xB · ξ, where ξ ∈ N (0, 1) and xB is the initial concentration vector.
The second simulation (“AR”) uses a ﬂow dependent AR model for background
errors. The initial perturbation is δxB = A−1 30% xB · ξ , as described in section 2. The third simulation (“AR+SV ”) adds perturbations along the largest 40

D initialized one. The AR+SV ensemble performs best over the target area and
very well over the entire domain.

Conclusions

This paper discusses some of the challenges associated with the application of
nonlinear ensemble ﬁltering data assimilation to atmospheric chemical transport models. The distinguishing feature of these models is the presence of nonlinear and stiﬀ chemical interactions occurring at very short characteristic time
scales.
A correct initialization of the ensemble is necessary for a successful application of nonlinear ﬁltering data assimilation. We propose to model background
errors using multilateral autoregressive processes. Such models are computationally inexpensive and capture well the error correlations along the ﬂow lines.
Total energy singular vectors are calculated for chemically reactive ﬂows. A dual
projection technique (with the tangent linear and with the adjoint models) is
proposed to keep the linearized solutions on the slow manifold and preserve the
symmetry of the chemistry tangent linear – adjoint operators.
The data assimilation test problem considered here is based on a large scale
simulation of air pollution in East Asia in March 2001. The ensembles are initialized using autoregressive models of background errors and total energy singular
vectors. The superposition of these two types of initial perturbations leads to an
ensemble that performs very well both over the target area and over the entire
computational domain.
