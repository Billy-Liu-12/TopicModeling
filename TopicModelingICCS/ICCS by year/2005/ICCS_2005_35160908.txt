eﬃciently. Numerical experiment results are presented.
Keywords: Semiconductor quantum dot array, the Schr¨

Vertically Aligned Quantum Dot Array Model

Recent advances in fabrication and varied applications of semiconductor quantum dot array (QDA) have attracted intensive studies in theoretical, experimental, and numerical. The energy state spectrum and the corresponding wave
functions of a QDA system is of basic physical interest and is crucial for designing
applications like photoelectric devices.
A main challenge for simulating a three-dimensional QDA is to solve very
large scale eigenvalue problems for only several interior eigenvalues that are of
interest. Aiming at the QDA that disk-shaped co-axial InAs QDs are vertically
aligned and embedded in a cylindrical GaAs matrix (see left part of Figure 1),
we develop eﬃcient numerical schemes overcome the diﬃculties.
The QDA is modelled by the Schr¨
odinger equation, in the cylindrical coordinate, as

Numerical Schemes

This section discusses the numerical schemes used for solving the threedimensional QDA Schr¨
odinger equation (1) to compute the electron energy levels
and the associated wave function in the system.
We ﬁrst discretize the domain by choosing mesh points. Regular uniform
mesh points are chosen in the azimuthal angle θ coordinate. Non-uniform mesh
points are used in the radial coordinate r and the natural axial coordinate z
with the following two special treatments. First, in the heterojunction area, ﬁne
meshes are used to capture the rapid change of the wave functions. Secondly, a
half of the mesh length is shifted in the radial coordinate to avoid incorporating
the pole condition [3].

where Fi,j,k is the approximated value of wave function F at the grid point
(ri , θj , zk ) for = 1, 2, i = 1, . . . , ρ, j = 1, . . . , µ, and k = 1, . . . , ζ. In the
heterojunctions, two-point ﬁnite diﬀerences are applied on the interface conditions of the QDs. The numerical boundary values for the matrix in the z- and
r-direction are zeros according to the Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Assembling the ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations results in a ρµζ-by-ρµζ 3D
eigenvalue problem. By reordering the unknown vector and using the fast Fourier
transformation to tridiagonalize matrices Tk (λ) (for k = 1, . . . , ζ), we obtain µ
independent ρζ-by-ρζ eigenvalue problems with the form
Tj (λ)Fj = Dj (λ)Fj ,

(4)

for j = 1, . . . , µ, where Tj (λ) and Dj (λ) are ρζ-by-ρζ matrices. Each of the
eigenvalue problems in the form of (4) is called a 2D eigenvalue problem, since
the grid points of the unknowns in Fj have the same θ value. By multiplying the
common denominator of (4), we can then form the cubic λ-matrix polynomial
A(λ)F = (λ3 A3 + λ2 A2 + λA1 + A0 )F = 0,

(5)

where A0 , A1 , A2 , and A3 are independent to λ. The cubic eigenvalue problem can then be solved eﬃciently by (i) the cubic Jacobi–Davidson method to
compute the smallest positive eigenvalue representing the ground state energy,
and (ii) the explicit deﬂation scheme to estimate the successive smallest positive
eigenvalues (i.e. the excited energy states). See [4,5] for detail.

Results and Discussions

In our numerical experiments, we assume that Hdot and Rdot of the QDs are
3 and 7.5 nm, respectively. For the matrix, Rmtx = 37.5 nm and 6 nm matrix
layer are assumed above the top and below the bottom of the QDA. The material
parameters used in the experiments are c1 = 0.0000, g1 = 0.4200, δ1 = 0.4800,
P1 = 0.7730, c2 = 0.7700, g2 = 1.5200, δ2 = 0.3400, and P2 = 0.8071. Numerical
simulation ﬁndings are summarized as follows.
The ground state energy of the QDA are aﬀected by the number of QDs and
the spacer layer distances d0 . Right top of Figure 1 (a) shows the computed
ground state energies versus the number of QDs. It is clear that more QDs in
the QDA results in lower ground state energy for a ﬁxed d0 . Furthermore, for a
ﬁxed number of QDs, smaller spacer layer distances lead to lower ground state
energies. Right bottom part of Figure 1 shows the diﬀerences (in logarithm)

array contains six quantum dots and d0 = 0, 0.5, 2, 6 nm, respectively

of the energies for the QDAs containing n and n + 1 QDs for n = 1, · · · , 11.
For various d0 = 1, 2, 3 nm, the ground state energies decrease exponentially
in a similar manner. To be speciﬁc, the energy diﬀerences can be nicely ﬁtted
by the linearly least-squares lines with slope −0.407. Figure 2 demonstrates
wave functions corresponding to the ground state energy for QDA formed by
six quantum dots and d0 = 0, 0.5, 2, 6 nm. The results suggest how the wave
functions change as the d0 is decreased.
