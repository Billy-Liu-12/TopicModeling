Abstract. In credit card portfolio management, predicting the cardholders’ behavior is a key to reduce the charge off risk of credit card issuers. The most
commonly used methods in predicting credit card defaulters are credit scoring
models. Most of these credit scoring models use supervised classification methods. Although these methods have made considerable progress in bankruptcy
prediction, they are unsuitable for data records without predefined class labels.
Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the applicability of unsupervised
learning methods in credit card accounts classification. The objectives of this
paper are: (1) to explore an unsupervised learning method: cluster analysis, for
credit card accounts classification, (2) to improve clustering classification results using ensemble and supervised learning methods. In particular, a general
purpose clustering toolkit, CLUTO, from university of Minnesota, was used to
classify a real-life credit card dataset and two supervised classification methods,
decision tree and multiple-criteria linear programming (MCLP), were used to
improve the clustering results. The classification results indicate that clustering
can be used to either as a stand-alone classification method or as a preprocess
step for supervised classification methods.
Keywords: Credit Card Accounts Classification, Clustering analysis, CLUTO,

1 Introduction
One of the major tasks in credit card portfolio management is to reliably predict credit
cardholders’ behaviors. This task has two impacts in credit management: (1) identify
potential bankrupt accounts and (2) develop appropriate policies for different categories of credit card accounts. To appreciate the importance of bankrupt accounts prediction, some statistics are helpful: There are about 1.2 billion credit cards in circulation in US. The total credit card holders declared bankruptcy in 2003 are 1,625,208
which are almost twice as many as the number of 812,898 in 1993 [4]. The total credit

card debt at the end of the first quarter 2002 is about $660 billion [1]. Bankrupt accounts caused creditors millions of dollars lost each year. In response, credit card
lenders have made great effort to improve traditional statistical methods and recognized that more sophisticated analytical tools are needed in this area. Development of
appropriate policies for various groups of credit card accounts also has a great impact
on credit card issuers’ profits. From the creditor’s standpoint, the desirable policies
should help to keep the profitable customers and minimize the defaults.
Under this strong business motivation, various techniques have been developed
and applied to credit card portfolio management. The survey conducted by
Rosenberg and Gleit [5] about quantitative methods in credit management provides
a comprehensive review of major analytical techniques. According to Rosenberg
and Gleit, discriminant analysis is the most popular quantitative tool in credit analysis at that time. In addition, integer programming, decision trees, expert systems,
neural networks, and dynamic models are also available. Although these methods
have made considerable progress in bankruptcy prediction, most of them are supervised learning methods. That is, they require previous knowledge about credit card
accounts to make prediction. Supervised learning methods have both advantage and
disadvantage. Supervised learning can normally achieve high prediction accuracy if
the historical data and the data need to be analyzed have similar characteristics. The
disadvantage is that supervised learning methods can not be used if there are no
data records with known class labels. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the
usefulness of unsupervised learning in credit card accounts classification. Compare
with supervised learning methods, unsupervised classification methods require no
previous class labels of records. Rather, they classify data records based on their
underlying structures or characteristics.
The objectives of this paper are: (1) to explore an unsupervised learning method:
cluster analysis, for credit card accounts classification, (2) to improve clustering classification results using ensemble and supervised learning methods. In other words,
this paper is trying to investigate the applicability of clustering both as a stand-alone
classification method and as a preprocess step for supervised classification methods.
In particular, a general purpose clustering toolkit, CLUTO, from university of Minnesota, was used to classify a real-life credit card dataset. Due to the fact that unsupervised classification methods normally have lower prediction accuracies than supervised method, two supervised classification method, decision tree and multiplecriteria linear programming (MCLP) [6], were used to improve the clustering results
based on the clustering analysis results.
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 briefly introduces cluster analysis and
CLUTO, section 3 outlines the features of credit card dataset used in the paper, section 4 illustrates how the proposed process can be applied to credit card accounts
classification and reports the results, and section 5 summarizes the paper.

2 Cluster Analysis and CLUTO
Cluster analysis refers to group data records into clusters based on some criterion
functions. Cluster can be defined as a collection of data records that are similar to
one another within the same cluster and dissimilar to the records in other clusters.

Clustering is categorized as an unsupervised classification method because it does
not require predefined classes. Instead, clustering algorithms automatically group
data records by recognizing their underlying structures and characteristics. Clustering can be applied to different data types, including interval-scaled variables, binary
variables, nominal variables, ordinal variables, and ratio-scaled variables, and various application areas, including pattern recognition, image processing, life science,
and economic science [3].
According to different criteria, clustering methods can be classified into different
categories. Han and Kamber [3] divided clustering methods into five approaches:
partitioning, hierarchical, density-based, grid-based, and model-based. Partitioning
methods construct a partition of the original dataset into k clusters that optimizes the
partitioning criterion and k is predefined. Hierarchical methods can be either agglomerative or divisive. Agglomerative algorithms assign each data object to its own cluster and then repeatedly merging clusters until a stopping criterion is met [7]. Divisive
algorithms treat all data records as one cluster and then repeatedly splitting clusters
until a stopping criterion is met. Density-based algorithms cluster data records according to their density. Grid-based algorithms use multi-resolution data structure and
represent datasets in n-dimensional feature space. Model-based algorithms try to optimize the fit between the data and some mathematical models.
Various commercial and free softwares have been designed to implement different
clustering algorithms. CLUTO is a general purpose clustering toolkit developed by
Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota [2].
CLUTO was chose in this research for three major reasons. First, CLUTO provides
multiple classes of clustering algorithms and uses multiple similarity/distance functions. Second, CLUTO has been successfully used in application areas like information retrieval, customer purchasing transactions, web, GIS, science, and biology
(CLUTO 2003). Third, CLUTO is free software.

3 Credit Card Dataset Description
The raw data came originally from a major US bank. It contains 6000 records and 102
variables (38 original variables and 64 derived variables) describing cardholders’
behaviors. The 6000 credit card records were randomly selected from 25,000 real-life
credit card records. The data were collected from June 1995 to December 1995 (seven
months) and the cardholders were from twenty-eight States in USA. This dataset has
been used as a classic working dataset by credit card issuers for various data analyses
to support the bank’s business intelligence. Each record has a class label to indicate
its’ credit status: either Good or Bad. Bad indicates a bankrupt credit card account and
Good indicates a good status account. Within the 6000 records, 960 accounts are
bankrupt accounts and 5040 are good status accounts. The 38 original variables can
be divided into four categories: balance, purchase, payment, cash advance, in addition
to related variables. The category variables represent raw data of previous six or
seven consecutive months. The related variables include interest charges, date of last
payment, times of cash advance, and account open date. The 64 derived variables are

created from the original 38 variables to reinforce the comprehension of cardholder’s
behaviors, such as times overlimit in last two years, calculated interest rate, cash as
percentage of balance, purchase as percentage to balance, payment as percentage to
balance, and purchase as percentage to payment. These variables are not static; rather,
they are evolving. New variables which are considered important can be added and
variables which are proved to be trivia or irrelative in separating can be removed.
Among these variables, 8 variables were selected for clustering computation
following expert advices. The 8 variables are: Interest charge Dec. 95, Interest charge
Dec. 95 as percent of credit line, Number of months since last payment, Credit line,
Number of times delinquency in last two years, Average payment of revolving
accounts, Last balance to payment ratio, and Average OBT revolving accounts. Due
to the space limit, the selection criteria for classification variables will not be
discussed here.

4 Empirical Studies of Cluster Analysis
As stated in the introduction, this section described two empirical studies of cluster
analysis. The first study applied CLUTO to the credit card dataset to generate a set of
classification results. The second study tested whether decision tree and MCLP can
improve clustering classification results. Decision tree was chosen for study because
it is a well-known supervised classification method. MCLP was chosen because it has
been demonstrated superior performance in our previous study [6]. The research procedures for the first and second study were summarized in Method 1 and 2.
Method 1
Input:
The data set A = {A1,A2A3,…,A6000}
Output:
The clustering analysis results.
Step 1. Select 8 attributes from Ai = (a1, a2, a3, . . . , a64), Generate the 6000 credit
card data set.
Step 2. Apply the various clustering and analysis algorithms implemented in
CLUTO to do a 2 to 20 way clustering analysis.
Step 3. Choose 3 clustering results according to certain criteria.
Step 4. A majority vote committee of 3 results will generate a final analysis result.
The performance measures of the classification will be decided by majorities of the
committee. If more than 2 of the committee members give out right classification
result, then the clustering analysis Ci for this observation are successful, otherwise,
the analysis is failed.

Step 2. Apply the two-group MCLP model to the training dataset T to compute the
compromise solution X* = (x1*, x2*, . . . , x8*) as the best weights of all 8 variables with
given values of control parameters (b, α*, β*).
Step 3. Apply See5 to the training dataset T to compute the Decision Tree and its
classification result.
END
The results of applying Method 1 and 2 were summarized in Table 1 and 2. The
average predictive accuracies for Bad and Good groups using CLUTO are 81.17%
and 66.87% and the average of Type I and Type II error rate of using CLUTO is
36.26%. Compared with these results, ensemble technique improves the classification
accuracies (Bad: 91.25%, Good: 69.84%) and reduces the average of Type I and Type
II error rates (32.88%). Both supervised learning methods, decision tree and MCLP,
achieved better classification results for Bad records. MCLP generated better average
Type I and Type II error rate (34.69%).

5 Conclusions
Classification of credit cardholders’ behavior is an important data mining application
in banking industry. Situations in which there are no predefined class labels call for
unsupervised classification methods. Based on this observation, this paper investigated two roles of an unsupervised classification method, cluster analysis, using a
real-life credit card dataset. Cluster analysis can be used as a stand-alone classification method or as a preprocess step for supervised classification methods. The empirical results of this paper indicated that as a stand-alone classification method, cluster
analysis generated lower classification rates than supervised methods. However, when
combined with supervised methods, the classification results can be improved considerably.
