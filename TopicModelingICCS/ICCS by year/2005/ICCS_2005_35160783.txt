Abstract. In this paper, we introduce integral sampling and study the
reconstruction of signals based on non-uniform average samples in spline
subspace. By using a new method, we obtain a new reconstruction formula.

Introduction

In digital signal and image processing, digital communication, etc., a continuous signal is usually represented and processed by using its discrete samples.
For a bandlimited signal of finite energy, it is completely characterized by its
samples, and is described by the famous classical Shannon sampling theorem.
However, in many real applications sampling points are not always regular and
sampled value may not be values of a signal f precisely at times xk for the inertia of the measurement aparatus. As for the signal spaces, they are not always
bandlimited signal of finite energy. The problem arose initially in the design of
an interferometer in which the interferogram is obtained using a continuously
moving mirror, but may also have bearing in other problems in which the data
are smoothed by an integrating sensor, such as a CCD array with slow response
time compared to the sample integral. So we need to give the reconstruction of
signals from samples of its integral. As special shift-invariant spaces and nonbandlimited spaces, spline subspaces yield many advantages in their generation
and numerical treatment so that there are many practical applications for signal
or image processing[1-15]. In this paper, we discuss the reconstruction of signal
from samples of its integral in spline subspaces.
The outline of this paper is in the following. In Section 2, we introduce the
concept of integral sampling and give the reconstruction formula from regular
incremental integral samples in spline subspaces. In section 3, numerical results
are included. The conclusion is given in Section 4.

Reconstruction of Signal from Regular Incremental
Integral Samples in Spline Subspaces

Suppose a and b are given constants that satisfy b − a = 1. Let
k+b

yk =

−∞

k+a

f (t)dt, yk−1 =

−∞

f (t)dt, zk = yk − yk−1 .

We refer to {zk } as the set of regular integral samples. The problem is how
to reconstruct the signal f from {zk } (regular incremental integral samples).
We now introduce some notations and lemma that will be used in Section 2.
In this paper, the Fourier transform of f is defined by fˆ(ω) = R f (x)e−ixω dx.
ck ϕN (· − k) : {ck } ∈ 2 } is spline subspace generated by
The space VN = {
k∈Z

ϕN = χ[0,1] ∗ · · · ∗ χ[0,1] (N convolutions), N ≥ 1. It is well-known that the space
VN is a special shift-invariant space.
Lemma 2.1. Let y(t) =

t
−∞

f (x)dx and f ∈ VN , then y ∈ VN +1 .

Theorem 2.1[8] . For arbitrary f ∈ VN , we have
f (x) =

f (k +

where S(ω)

ϕN (k+ N2+1 )e−ikω

and VN is spline subspace generated by ϕN =

χ[0,1] ∗ · · · ∗ χ[0,1] (N ≥ 1 convolutions).
By Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 2.1, we have the following result.
Theorem 2.2. Let
yk =

k+ 12 +1
−∞

k+ 12

f (t)dt, yk−1 =

−∞

f (t)dt, zk = yk − yk−1 .

Then for any f ∈ VN , we have reconstruction formula
zk h(t − k),

f (t) =
k∈Z

where h is defined by
ˆ 1 (ω) = iω
hk = h1k + hk+1 , h

ϕˆN +1 (ω)
,
ϕN +1 (k + N2 + 1)e−ikω

hk (·) = h(· − k) and h1k (·) = h1 (· − k).
Actually, Theorem 2.2 shows the reconstruction formula from regular incremental integral samples in VN . The incremental integral samples can be regarded
as special weighted samples. The interpolation function h is implementary. This
will be shown in Section 3.

Numerical Examples

In the section, we will give some numerical tests. So we need a brief and applicable formation of sampling function h in Theorem 2.2.
In Theorem 2.2, we have relation hk = h1k + hk+1 . Taking the Fourier transform of both sides of the above equality, we have the following equality:
ˆ 1 (ω)
h
.
1 − e−iω
For precision, we give the following equality
ˆ
h(ω)
=

ˆ
h(ω)
=

iω
1 − e−iω

ϕˆN +1 (ω)
.
ϕN +1 (k + N2 + 1)e−ikω

By the inverse Fourier transform, we can find interpolation function h.
Let N = 3 in our numerical tests. Then

We will reconstruct the signal f (x) = ϕ3 (x) + 2ϕ3 (x − 1) + 3ϕ3 (x + 1) ∈ V3
from its integral samples{zk =

k+ 32
k+ 12

f (t)dt}.

It is obvious that suppf ⊆ [−1, 4]. So we only think about finite sampling
set, that is, k = −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in reconstruction formula. The sample values of
the function f in integer point {f (k)}k=−1,0,1,2,3,4 are marked by ∗ in Figure
1. In fact, {zk = f, u(· − k) } is the result of {f (k)}k=−1,0,1,2,3,4 perturbed by
noise. The noisy signal sampling points {zk } marked by and are connected by
”- -” in Figure 1.
We will give the reconstruction from the weighted sampling point {zk }. In
Figure 2, the original signal is represented by continuous line. Reconstruction
signal using the above mentioned algorithm is represented by ”-.-”.

To measure the accuracy of the reconstruction, we compute the mean square
error(MSE) by the formula M SE =

t∈D

(f (t) −

{−1, −0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4}. It is easy to know MSE of the function
f (t) is 1.5466e-15.
The graph of the reconstruction signal is almost identical to the graph of the
original signal in Figure 2. MSE reflects the observation.

Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce the new concept of integral sampling where a signal
is perfectly reconstructed from the samples of the integral of the signal. The
explicit reconstruction formula is obtained in the case of regular sampling in the
spline shift-invariant spaces. Finally we successfully give a numerical example to
demonstrate out results. Due to the limitation of four-page papers, we omit all
proofs.
