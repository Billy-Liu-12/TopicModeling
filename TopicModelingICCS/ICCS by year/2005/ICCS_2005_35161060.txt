Abstract. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two reference models for supporting wireless video broadcasting services based on ATM over LMDS in metropolitan area wireless access networks. Our proposed reference models,
namely end-to-end ATM model and headend/server-to-hub ATM model, are
characterized. The end-to-end ATM model supports transfer of the ATM cell
between headend and set-top box located in the end of networks for the wireless
video services. The headend/server-to-hub ATM model transfers the ATM cell
between headend/server and hub, and transmits the LMDS frame in the MPEGTS over LMDS wireless access network. The performance evaluation of the
proposed models is performed via analysis and simulation. The results evaluate
delay and jitter of two proposed models. Especially, headend/server-to-hub
ATM model has better performance than end-to-end ATM model for wireless
video services because the end-to-end ATM model additionally needs more delay and jitter than headend/server-to-hub ATM model to convert the ATM cell
to the LMDS frame.

1 Introduction
Recently, Broadband wireless access loop technologies are represented by MMDS
(Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service) and LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Service). Wireless video services use the wireless access loop such as LMDS
instead of the coax cable for CATV and VoD (Video on Demand) service. Especially,
we need the analysis about sensitive feature about the jitter and delay caused by the
transmission of the video and image data in the broadband wireless multimedia networks [3,4]. However, in our study until now there are no reference models for supporting video services in broadband wireless networks.
This paper presents two reference models of the wireless video broadcasting services based on ATM over LMDS in metropolitan area wireless access networks. The
first reference model is the end-to-end ATM model, where ATM cell is transferred
between the set-top box and the headend/server. The second reference model is the
headend/server-to-hub ATM model. In the second model, ATM cell is transmitted be*

tween the hub and the headend/server in fixed network segment based on ATM, and
MPEG2-TS (Transport Stream) is transferred to the set-top box in the radio access
network segment using LMDS. We evaluate the performance of the proposed models
in terms of the end-to-end delay and jitter of MPEG2-TS. In conclusion, the
headend/server-to-hub ATM model can reduce more the delay and the jitter than endto-end ATM model.

2 The Proposed Architecture Models
Wireless access loop has more merits than the wired cable in the view points of the
economical efficiency and network flexibility. Wireless video system based on
LMDS/ATM consists of service provider, headend, hub, set-top box, etc. We propose
two architecture models namely, the end-to-end ATM model and the headend/severto-hub ATM model, to support the wireless video services based on LMDS/ATM
[5,6].
The end-to-end ATM model supports transfer of the ATM cell between headend
and set-top box located in the end of the wireless CATV or VoD system. This model
uses the ATM backbone network and the LMDS wireless access network. In this
model, the ATM cell is translated into LMDS frame to transmit the data between hub
and set-top box, and LMDS frame is conversed into the ATM cell in set-top box. Figure 1 shows the protocol stack in end-to-end ATM model which supports the ATM
protocol stack in all devices such as a headend, set-top box, hub, etc.

In the headend/server-to-hub ATM model, the ATM cell is transferred between
headend/server and hub, and the LMDS frame included the MPEG-TS is transmitted
in wireless access network. Then, the MPEG-TS frame is translated into LMDS frame
to transmit the data between hub and set-top box. Especially, the main features of this
proposed model is that the ATM cell is translated into MPEG2-TS frame and LMDS
frame in hub, and conversed LMDS frame into the MPEG2-TS frame in set-top box.

Figure 2 describes that the protocol in headend/server-to-hub ATM model can support
the ATM protocol stack in all devices such as a headend and hub. The hub removes
the AAL head of the ATM cell and recombines with the MPEG2-TS stream.

3 Performance Evaluations
To verify the performance, we analyze jitter factors that happen in headend/server,
hub and set-top box in the headend/server-to-hub model and end-to-end ATM model.
We quantatively analyze the models in terms of end-to-end delay and jitter of
MPEG2-TS and perform simulation using OPNET (Optimized Network Engineering
Tool) by MIL3 company .

The simulation environment of wireless video service networks based on
LMDS/ATM consists of the video source, server/headend, hub and set-top box. We assume that the distance from headend to hub sets by 50Km which is the size of a traditional CATV service area, and radio LMDS transmission link between the hub and

set-top box establishes by 5Km. The transfer speed of the 155Mbps recommended by
the ATM forum between server and hub is used, while the flower garden image is used.
The fixed end-to-end delay is 0.39ms and the jitter is between 0.39ms and 0.68ms
at the radio channel speed 26.88Mbps used flower garden images in the end-to-end
ATM model. Especially, jitter has a high probability value between 0.44ms and
0.57ms because the conversion of MPEG2-TS to AAL5 PDU and ATM cell to LMDS
frame cause much jitter factor. In the table 1, we present the maximum end-to-end delay and jitter of MPEG2-TS for football and flower garden images according to radio
channel speed.

headend/server-to-hub ATM model. In the table 2, we present the maximum end-toend delay and jitter of MPEG2-TS for football and flower garden images according to
radio channel speed. The simulation results demonstrate the delay and jitter of two
proposed models in the wireless CATV and wireless VoD service based on
LMDS/ATM. Especially, headend/server-to-hub ATM model has better performance
than end-to-end ATM model for wireless video services because additionally the endto-end ATM model needs more delay and jitter than headend/server-to-hub ATM
model to convert the ATM cell to the LMDS frame.
