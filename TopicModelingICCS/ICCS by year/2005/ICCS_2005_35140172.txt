Abstract. In our previous efforts, a least squares finite element lattice
Boltzmann method (LSFE-LBM) was developed and successfully applied to
simulate fluid flow in porous media. In this paper, we extend LSFE-LBM to
simulate solute transport in bulk fluid and couple it with non-linear
sorption/desorption processes at solid particle surfaces. The influences of the
Peclet number and sorption non-linearity on solute transport is evaluated.
Results of this work demonstrate the capability of using LSFE-LBM to study
fluid flow and non-linear mass transfer processes at the pore scale.

Introduction

To provide for effective and efficient groundwater contamination prevention and
remediation, it is important to possess a clear understanding of the complex mass
transfer processes governing solute transport in the subsurface environment. Solute
mass transfer in the subsurface includes several processes acting simultaneously: (i)
advective-dispersive transport from bulk solution to the boundary layer of a soil or
sediment particle; (ii) film diffusion across adsorbed water to the surface of a particle;
(iii) sorption/desorption processes at the surface of the soil particle; and (iv)
intrasorbent diffusion. Different factors, including transport-related non-equilibrium
processes and sorption-related non-equilibrium processes, influence mass transfer in
the subsurface [1], leading to non-ideal behaviors; i.e., early breakthrough and tailing
breakthrough curves (BTC). Traditional advective-dispersive equations, which
employ a local equilibrium assumption (LEA), fail to predict this non-ideal behavior
[2]. In the last two decades, many efforts were devoted to better capture both
transport-related and sorption-related non-equilibrium processes and elucidate the
comparative contributions of different factors [3].
Recently, lattice Boltzmann method has been successfully applied to simulate fluid
flow in porous media [4], providing a powerful alternative to model transport-related
non-equilibrium processes. In this paper, we use a newly developed least squares
finite element lattice Boltzmann method [5] to simulate fluid flow in porous media.
Further, we extend LSFE-LBM to simulate solute transport in bulk fluid and couple it
with non-linear sorption/desorption processes at particle surfaces.

2 Least Squares Finite Element Lattice Boltzmann Method
Although LBM has been developed as an effective tool to simulate complex fluid
flow problems in porous media, one of the challenges with LBM is its inability to
allow irregularity in the lattice [6]. We developed a least squares finite element lattice
Boltzmann method (LSFE-LBM), which uses a LSFE method [7] in space and CrankNicolson method in time to solve the lattice Boltzmann equation. As described in an
earlier publication [5], LSFE-LBM was successfully implemented on unstructured
mesh to simulate fluid flow in porous media, requiring fewer grid points and
consuming significantly less memory than traditional LBM.
2.1 Derivation of LSFE-LBM
Beginning with the basic equations of the LBM with a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
collision operator:
∂f i ! !

(1)
+ ci ⋅ ∇f i = − ( f i − f i eq ) (i = 1,2,...N )
τ
∂t
where fi represents particle distribution moving with velocity ci, τ is the relaxation
time,

f i eq is the local equilibrium function, and N is the number of elements per site

based on the LB model employed. Discretizing in time with a Crank-Nicholson
scheme, a standard form of the governing equation for LSFE-LBM is
(2)
Lf n +1 = p

∂y
where ∆t denotes the time step in the Crank-Nicholson scheme.
In the finite element implementation, the problem domain is first discretized into a
set of finite elements, and then an approximate solution, fhe,n+1 in the eth finite element
is formulated as:

f he , n +1 =

∑N

f jn +1

(4)

Here, Nj denotes the element shape function, n represents the number of variables
in the element, and fj is the value of the j-th variable. Introducing this approximation
into Eq. (2), the residual error at a point in the element is obtained. Integrating the
square of this error over each element and minimizing the integral with respect to the
nodal variables of the element, the elemental matrix relationship of the following
form is obtained:

2.2 LSFE-LBM Simulating Fluid Flow
In this study, a two-dimensional, nine-velocity lattice model (D2Q9) [8] is employed
to implement LSFE-LBM for fluid flow. Accurate numerical results have been
obtained for incompressible Poiseuille flow, Couette flow, and flow past a circular
cylinder. Figure 1 is an example application of LSFE-LBM modeling fluid flow in
porous media using an unstructured mesh.

media

2.3 LSFE-LBM Simulating Solute Transport
In this study, we assume that the solute concentration is sufficiently low that it will
not influence solvent flow. In this case, the solute can be described by a separate
particle distribution function [9]. To recover the advection-diffusion equation, a
simple square lattice with four possible directions is sufficient, which is thus used for
implementing LSFE-LBM simulating solute transport.
The validation of LSFE-LBM simulating solute transport is evaluated by a problem
describing diffusion between two parallel walls. As illustrated in Figure 2, the two
walls are assumed to be porous and a constant normal flow ua is injected through the
lower wall and removed from the upper wall. The concentration of solute at the lower
and upper walls is maintained with CU and CL, respectively. In this specific problem,
CU is assumed higher than CL; it follows that solute diffuses counter to the flow
of the fluid.

where, Φ is a normalized concentration defined as: Φ = C − C L , and D is the
CU − C L
diffusivity of solute. Analytical solutions can be obtained for this problem in two
special cases. In Case I, when ua = 0, Eq. (8) will reduce to an unsteady state pure
diffusion problem. The analytical solution can be expressed as:

When u a ≠ 0 (Case II), analytical solutions are only available for steady-state
conditions:

Results presented in Figure 3 illustrate that LSFE-LBM achieves close agreement
with the analytical solution for solute transport in both unsteady state and steady state
conditions.

3 Mass Transfer Processes Simulation
3.1 Problem Description
To explore the influences of different factors on mass transfer processes, we consider
fluid flow and transport through and around a single circular particle, set in a twodimensional domain with a uniform far-field velocity, as illustrated in Figure 4.

A constant body force is imposed to drive fluid to flow from the left to right. When
fluid flow reaches steady state, an instantaneous slug of solute is injected as a line
source, as shown in Figure 4. Solute transport in the bulk fluid is driven by advection
and diffusion processes. Several solute particles will diffuse across the water film to
the surface of the particle. Sorption/desorption processes will then occur at the
particle surface. The sorption rate at the particle surface can be expressed [10] as a
function of the concentration difference between the solid and solution phases:
∂q
(12)
= kaC n − kd q
∂t
where, q is the solute concentration in the solid phase, C is the solute concentration
in solution, ka is a sorption rate coefficient, kd is a desorption rate coefficient, and m is
an exponent. At equilibrium, sorption isotherm models provide the relationship
between sorbed-phase solute concentration and solute concentration in solution.
Here, we express the relationship in terms of a Freundlich model:
(13)
q = (ka / kd )C n = k f C n
3.2 Boundary Conditions
For fluid flow, periodic boundary conditions are imposed on all four boundaries, and
a non-slip boundary condition is imposed at the solid surface. For solute transport,
periodic boundary conditions are enforced at the top and bottom boundaries. Non-flux
boundary conditions are enforced at the inlet and outlet of the simulation domain. In
order to provide for a valid non-flux boundary condition, the length of the simulation
domain is adjusted such that there is no mass loss at the domain inlet and outlet. At
the solid particle surface, the boundary condition can be expressed as:
∂C
(14)
−D
= k aC n − k d q
∂n

where D is the solute diffusion coefficient in the fluid, and n is the direction normal to
the interface pointing toward the fluid phase. To implement this boundary condition
in LSFE-LBM, a relationship between the concentration gradient and microscale
particle parameters is required. For the 4 velocity lattice Boltzmann model, Eq. (15)
can be derived by the Chapman-Enskog expansion.
τ
(15)
∑i g i ciα ≅ Cuα − 2 ∂ α C
where gi is the particle distribution function for the solute, and α denotes x and y axis
directions for a two-dimensional case. Figure 5 provides an example of this boundary
condition at the upper right quadrant of a circular particle.

Using Eq. (15), the following expressions are derived:
g 2 − g 4 = −( k aC n − k d q) sin θ

(16)

(17)
g1 − g3 = −( kaC − kd q ) cos θ
Further, we know:
(18)
g1 + g 2 + g 3 + g 4 = C
Unknown distribution functions g1 and g2 is calculated, by solving this non-linear
equation system. At each time step, the solid phase concentration, q, at the particle
surface is updated based on Eq. (12).

3.3 Results
The simulation is carried out for a particle with radius R = 50 µm in the domain as
defined in Figure 4. The evolution of the concentration profile is represented at four
selected time steps in Figure 6. This example vividly displays the influence of particle
geometry and fluid hydrodynamics on the solute concentration profile, suggesting the
need to further evaluate transport-related non-equilibrium processes in more complex
systems.
Using the same Reynolds number (Re = 1.0), we examined the influence of the
Peclet number on mass transfer processes. (Pe = uL/D, where u is the x-direction
specific flow rate, L is the characteristic length of the domain which equals six times
the particle diameter, and D is the solute diffusion coefficient in the bulk fluid.) By
adjusting the values of D, two different breakthrough curves for Pe=10 and Pe=20 are
observed at the control plane (Figure 7(a)). While representing the relative speed of
fluid flow and solute diffusion, a lower Pe value denotes further deviation from an
ideal symmetric breakthrough, with an earlier breakthrough and longer tailing effect
as indicated in Figure 7 (a).

Further, the influence of non-linear sorption is evaluated to explore the influence of
sorption-related non-equilibrium on the mass transfer processes. Keeping all the other
parameters the same, we simulated two cases with n = 0.5 and n = 1.0 in the sorption
rate equation (Eq. 12). Here, the evolution of solid phase concentration for a point at
the surface of the particle is tracked. As expected, the presence of non-linear sorption
(n = 0.5) leads to a much stronger tailing effect (Figure 7 (b)).

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we successfully applied our newly developed LSFE-LBM to simulate
fluid flow and solute transport. LSEF-LBM was coupled with non-linear
sorption/desorption through use of properly developed boundary conditions. The
influences of particle geometry, Peclet number, and sorption/desorption non-linearity
on solute transport were studied. Results from this work demonstrate the ability of
LSFE-LBM to model fluid flow and highly non-linear mass transfer processes at the
pore scale. In the future, LSFE-LBM will be applied to more complex systems to
explore relative contributions of mass transfer processes with varying degrees of
permeability and a variety of sorption/desorption properties.
