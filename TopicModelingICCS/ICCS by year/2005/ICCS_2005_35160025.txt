Abstract. Despite recent progress in modelling the shape memory alloy
(SMA) behaviour, many diﬃculties remain due to various limitations of
the existing free energy models and strong nonlinearity of these nonlinear materials. Phase kinetics of SMA coupled with thermoelastodynamics is still not fully tractable, and one needs to deal with complicated
multiscale character of SMA materials requiring a linkage between their
microstructure and macroscopic properties. In this paper we develop a
new dynamic model of 3D SMA which employs an improved version of
the microscopic Landau theory. Essential properties of the single and
multivariant martensitic phase transformations are recovered using consistent steps, which eliminates the problem of non-uniqueness of energy
partitioning and relaxes the over-sensitivity of the free energy due to
many unknown material constants in previously reported models. We
exemplify our results on a model for cubic to tetragonal transformations
in a rectangular SMA bar by showing key algorithmic steps which can
be extended to more complex cases.

Introduction

Modelling of dynamics of phase transformations (PT) in Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) under the combined eﬀect of stress and temperature is one of the
most challenging problems in computational science and engineering. Our better
understanding of such dynamics can be achieved with multi-physics multiscale
models which assist the researchers in designing new materials and devices by
harnessing the shape memory eﬀect. Phenomenological framework based on Landau theory of martensitic transformations (e.g., [1]) has become a convenient
choice for basic building blocks in the computational models. However, most
of the phenomenological models are applicable at macroscopic and mesoscopic
scales as discussed in [2], and the strain ﬁeld in such model is often beyond the
resolution of bain strain. Also it may be noted that a majority of the works (see
e.g.[3, 4]) in this direction is based on selectively chosen strain gradient plasticity models that require extensive parameter ﬁtting from experimental data.
Also, in such framework, the true nature of nonlinearity and coupling is not fully
tractable. For a more detail description of the PT, one requires a microscopic
model, such as [5, 6], where the invariance of the free energy with respect to
the crystallographic point group symmetry is preserved but the discontinuous

nature of the deformation across the individual habit planes is introduced. This
provides the most essential information to describe the morphology of the microstructural evolution, whereas the process of reshuﬄing of the atoms, which
actually causes the reconstructive PT, remains beyond such a microstructural
scale. The latter process requires the description of chemical interaction energy
between atoms [7] and spin stabilized Hamiltonian [8]. Coupling such an atomistic process with the microstructural phenomenology means coupling a molecular dynamic model [9, 10] with a microscopic free energy model [6, 11, 12] through
the thermal ﬂuctuation term, strain and the motion of the domain walls.
In the present paper we focus our attention on linking SMA microstructure
and macroscopic behaviour by developing the microscopic free energy and the
associated coupled ﬁeld model to simulate the dynamics of 3D macroscopic sample of NiAl undergoing cubic to tetragonal PT. First, we observe that the free
energy is highly sensitive to many interdependent constants which are to be obtained experimentally [11]. As a result of this sensitivity and due to a fairly complex polynomial representation of the 3D Landau-Ginzburg free energy function,
there may be situations where multidimensional simulations produce unphysical
spurious oscillations. In the new model developed in the present paper, the above
set of interdependent constants, that need to be determined from experimental
data, is reduced to uniquely identiﬁable set of constants for each transformation
surface among the austenitic phase and a particular martensitic variant.
Note that earlier, a new low-dimensional model for the time-dependent dynamics of SMA was derived in [2] and a class of such reduced models was rigorously analyzed in [13]. Computational results presented in [2, 13] conﬁrmed
robustness of our modelling approach for a number of practically important
cases. The main results of the present paper are pertinent to the general threedimensional case. There are several recent studies where the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) (Langevin) equation with the correct microscopic
description of the Falk-Konopka type free energy function has been analyzed
(e.g. [14, 12]). We are not aware of any dynamic model of 3D SMA samples that
bases its consideration on the correct Ginzburg-Landau free energy representation in the microscopic scale and the momentum balance and heat conduction in
the macroscopic scale. The Ginzburg-Landau free energy function derived in the
ﬁrst part of this paper is incorporated in the coupled dynamic ﬁeld model. This
model is exempliﬁed for cubic to tetragonal PT with single martensitic variant
along the axis of a bar with rectangular cross-section under axial stress and heat
ﬂux.

3D Landau Theory of Martensitic Phase
Transformation

It has been demonstrated by Levitas and Preston [6, 12] that the polynomial
structures 2-3-4 and 2-4-6 of the Gibbs free energy in order parameter η in
Cartesian coordinate can eliminate the problem of unphysical minima and re-

tain all the necessary properties of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy function
with respect to point group symmetry of the crystals. Such polynomial structure
can be constructed in such a way that the stability of the austenitic phase (A)
and martensitic variants (Mj ), non-extremal diﬀusion barrier and nucleation can
be described in stress-temperature space. Furthermore, while using such polynomial structure the interfaces (domain walls) Mj − Mi between the martensitic
variants (i, j) can be interpreted by using a newly introduced barrierless A nucleation mechanism, i.e. by splitting the original into two simultaneously present
interfaces Mj − A and A − Mi . In this section a 2-3-4 polynomial structure is
constructed by improving upon the model of Levitas and Preston [6, 11].
For analytical clarity we ﬁrst consider a single variant of martensite and
single order parameter η ∈ [0, 1]. First we deﬁne the Gibbs free energy density
in stress-temperature space (σ, θ) as
G = −σ : λ : σ/2 − σ : εt ϕ(η) + f (θ, η) ,

(1)

where λ is the constant fourth-rank elastic compliance tensor, εt is the transformation strain tensor at the thermodynamic equilibrium of the martensite
(obtained from crystallography), ϕ(η) is a monotonic function with ϕ(0) = 0
indicating stable A phase and ϕ(1) = 1 indicating stable M phase. f (θ, η) is the
chemical part of the energy with property: f (θ, 1) − f (θ, 0) = ∆Gθ (θ), where
∆Gθ is the diﬀerence between the thermal parts of the Gibbs free energy density of the M and A phases, which can be obtained indirectly from experiments
[15] The objective now is to obtain the functions ϕ and f by satisfying their
properties mentioned above and the conditions of extremum of the energy for
existence of equilibrium of A and M phases: ∂G/∂η = 0 at η = 0, 1.
The new model derived below is based on the assumption that G can be
uniquely represented by a polynomial structure in η with the extremum only at
η = 0, 1 and out of these two extremum only one is minimum and the other is
maximum for phase transformation (PT) to happen. At equilibrium, we have
∂ϕ(η) ∂f (θ, η)
∂G

η = 0, 1.

(2)

The total strain tensor (ε = −∂G/∂σ) is the sum of the elastic strain tensor
(λ : σ) and the transformation strain tensor (εt ϕ(η)). Hence, for reconstructive
PT through vanishing misﬁt strain, the condition
σ : εt

must be satisﬁed. It is observed in the reported results [6] that the transformation
barrier is dependent on stress. In the context of interface barrier, Levitas and
Preston [12] have treated the associated η to be dependent on σ. In the present
paper, we propose an alternate approach by considering stress-dependent barrier
height because the stress σ is the only driving factor for PT under isothermal
condition. The polynomial structure which satisﬁes the extremum properties can
be expressed as
(4)
∂G/∂η = η(η − 1)(η − ηb ) ,

28

so that its roots η = 0, 1 satisfy Eq. (2) and the root η = ηb (σ, θ) represents the
A ↔ M PT barrier. Integrating Eq. (4) and imposing the combined properties
of ϕ(η) and f (θ, η) stated earlier as
G(σ, θ, 0) − G(σ, θ, 1) = σ : εt − ∆Gθ ,

(5)

we get that ηb = −6σ : εt + 6∆Gθ + 1/2. Using Eq. (1) in Eq. (4) and by
diﬀerentiating with respect to σ, one has

The term involving f can be eliminated from Eq. (6) with the help of Eq. (3),
and can be expressed as

= η(η − 1)(−6εt ) .
∂η

(7)

Integrating Eq. (7) and following the properties of the transformation strain, i.e.
ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ(1) = 1, we have ϕ(η) = 3η 2 − 2η 3 , 0 ≤ η ≤ 1 . Substituting
this form in Eq. (3) and integrating with respect to η, the chemical part of the
free energy density is obtained as

f (θ, η) = σ : εt (3η 2 − 2η 3 ) + ηb η 2 − (ηb + 1)η 3 + η 4 .

(8)

For A → M PT, the criteria for the loss of stability of A phase is ∂ 2 G/∂η 2 ≤ 0
at η = 0, which gives the stress driven condition:
σ : εt ≥ ∆Gθ +

(9)

Similarly, for M → A PT, the criteria for the loss of stability is ∂ 2 G/∂η 2 ≤ 0 at
η = 1, which gives the stress driven condition:
σ : εt ≤ ∆Gθ −

(10)

Mj ↔ Mi PT or diﬀused interface can evolve for stresses outside the range
obtained by Eqs. (9) and (10). Note that no parameter ﬁtting is required in the
present model as opposed to the earlier model [6]. Eqs. (9) and (10) indicate a
nonlinear dependence of the transformation surface on the temperature, which
can be compared with the experimental data.
2.1

Cubic to Tetragonal Transformation Characteristics

We now consider the cubic to tetragonal PT for single variant martensitic case
in absence of the elastic part of the stress. After reducing the stress and strain
tensors in 1D, the equilibrium stress-transformation curve is obtained as
η = ηb ⇒ σ =

Note that the increase in η causes decrease in σ which is consistent. The stress
hysteresis (H) is obtained as
H = σ(η=0) − σ(η=1) =

6εt

(12)

which is independent of the temperature. Eq. (11) also shows nonzero tangent
moduli where A and M lose their stability. These observations coincide with the
results from the earlier model [6] (Figs.1, 2 and 5).

Multivariant Phase Transformation

In order to model realistic situations and macroscopic sample of SMA it is essential to incorporate the eﬀects of (1) martensitic variants (Mk ) (2) thermal strain
(3) unequal compliances across the interfaces and the resulting inhomogeneity.
For cubic to tetragonal transformation there are three variants of martensite according to the point group of crystallographic symmetry. The Gibbs free energy
density thus should poses the associated invariance properties. In the mathematical model, this can be cross-checked by interchanging the variant indices (k). In
this paper we consider the same order of variation in the compliance tensor and
the thermal expansion tensor as in ϕ(η) derived in Sec. 2. The Gibbs free energy
density for cubic-tetragonal transformation having three variants k = 1, 2, 3 is
expressed as

where λ is the second-order forth-rank compliance tensor (λ0 is for A phase),
εθ0 = α0 (θ−θe ), εθk = αk (θ−θe ), α0 and αk are the thermal expansion tensor of
A and Mk . Fij is an interaction potential required to preserve the invariance of G
with respect to the point group of symmetry and uniqueness of the multivariant
PT at a given material point. The description of PT can now be generalized
with three sets of order parameters: ¯
0 = {0, ηk = 0, 0}, ¯1 = {0, ηk = 1, 0} and
η¯k = {0, ηk , 0}. The extremum property of the free energy density requires

The transformation energy associated with A ↔ Mk is

1) = σ : εtk − ∆Gθ .

(16)

30

Combining Eqs. (14) and (16) with similar steps described in Sec. 2, we get
ηbk = −6σ : εtk + 6∆Gθ + 1/2

(17)

Following the steps given in [11], we arrive at the symmetry preserving polynomial structure of the interaction potential
Fij = ηi ηj (1 − ηi − ηj ) B (ηi − ηj )2 − ηi − ηj + Dηi ηj + ηi2 ηj2 (ηi Zij + ηj Zji )

(19)

leads to a 2-3-4-5 polynomial structure, where B, D are constants estimated from
experiments. The transformation energy associated with Mi → Mj requires
G(σ, θ, η¯i ) − G(σ, θ, η¯j ) = σ : (εtj − εti )

(20)

which is already satisﬁed through Eq. (17). The uniqueness of PT at a material
point is now imposed through similar steps described in context of Eq. (6).

of numerical simulation we consider a rectangular NiAl bar with macroscopic

u(x, y, z, 0) = u0 (x) and ∂u(x, y, z, 0)/∂t = 0. A consistent form of the temperature ﬁeld is obtained as
θ(x, y, z, t) = θ1 (x, t) + (y + z)θ¯s .

In the present example we assume that the habit planes are normal to e1 , such
that η = η(x, t). For microscopic deformation, the ﬁne graining of strain requires
the property of cubic to tetragonal transformation. For this model, we obtain the
consistent form of the unknown ﬁelds u2 (x, y, z, t) and u3 (x, y, z, t) by imposing
the geometric constraints for eﬀectively one-dimensional dynamics, which leads

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, a new dynamic multiscale model for simulation of 3D SMA samples
has been developed by linking an improved version of the microscopic Landau
theory and macroscopic conservation laws. Essential properties of the A ↔ Mj
as well as Mj ↔ Mi PTs are recovered using consistent steps, which eliminates
the problem of non-uniqueness of energy partitioning during PTs and relaxes
the over-sensitivity of the free energy due to many unknown material constants
in previously reported models. It has been shown how the new 3D model can be
reduced to a low dimensional model for simulating the strongly coupled phase
kinetics and thermoelasticity in a rectangular bar undergoing cubic to tetragonal
phase transformations.
