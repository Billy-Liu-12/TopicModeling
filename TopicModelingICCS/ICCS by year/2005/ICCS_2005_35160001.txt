Abstract. A multiscale nonlinear ﬁnite element model for analysis and
design of the deformation gradient and the magnetic ﬁeld distribution
in Terfenol-D/epoxy thin ﬁlm device under Transverse Magnetic (TM)
mode of operation is developed in this work. A phenomenological constitutive model based on the density of domain switching (DDS) of an
ellipsoidal inclusion in unit cell of matrix is implemented. A sub-grid
scale homogenization technique is employed to upwind the microstructural information. A general procedure to ensure the solution convergence
toward an approximate inertial manifold is reported.

Introduction

In recent time, multiscale modeling and computation have become powerful tool
in solving many problems related to strongly coupled dynamics and multiphysics
phenomena in material science and engineering [1, 2]. Such an attempt, with judicious choice of the mathematical models which represent the mutually inseparable physical processes at the molecular scale, the lattice scale, the microstructural
scale, and at the continuum scale, can be highly reliable in interpreting the experimental results and also in designing new materials and devices with desired
multifunctionality. Many similar problems related to ﬂuidics, transport process,
biology and planetary sciences are of immense interest in the research community, which requires the advancement of multiscale computational methodology.
The magnetostrictive materials (a family of rare earth compounds), due to
large twinning of their magnetic domains, are ideal candidates for high powered microactuators, tunable microwave devices, shape memory devices and bioinspired systems. Among the majority of magnetostrictive materials, Tb-Dy-Fe
type compounds (industrially known as Terfenol-D) are common and show much
reduced macroscopic anisotropy [3]. Promising engineering applications are possible using deposited nanostructured ﬁlm [4, 5], multi-layers [3] and particulate
composite [6]. In magnetostrictive polymer thin ﬁlm, the magnetic domains are
essentially constrained and hence behave diﬀerently than their bulk samples. Improving the magnetostrictive performance (e.g. larger magnetostriction, smaller
hysteresis, wider range of linearity etc.) by sensitizing the dynamic twinning of

these magnetic domains under external ﬁeld is a complex design task which is far
from being straightforward using experiments alone and requires detail physical
model and intensive computation. Because of the coupled and nonlinear nature
of the dynamics, several computational diﬃculties exist which require special
attention.
Ever since the rationale behind the variationally consistent multiscale ﬁnite
element method was brought out by Hughes et al. [7], a tremendous amount
of research has been channelized in that path. Among several approaches to
tackle the evolvingly complex multiphysics computational mechanics problems,
very few approaches, namely the homogenization method [8, 9], the multi-level
hierarchical ﬁnite element method [10], the level-set method [11] and few others appear promising. In context of time-dependent problems, the concept of
consistent temporal integration [12] is worth noting, which extend itself beyond
the classical notion of upwinding. Subsequently, while attempting a strongly
nonlinear and coupled problem, the advantage in adopting a low-dimensional
manifold based on appropriate error estimate during iteration [2, 13] may be
noted. In the present paper we report a new variationally consistent multiscale
ﬁnite model with the following two features: (1) a sub-grid scale for upwinding
the miscrostructural information and (2) an approximate manifold of the original system that retains the desired accuracy in the ﬁnite element solution, which
is unlike the usual ordering scheme as followed in the conventional asymptotic
method of truncation.
Our present problem can be described as the magnetostriction induced transformation process in solid state called magnetic domain switching, which occurs
in the microscopic scale. In the macroscopic scale, the dynamics is governed
through the coupling between elasticity and electromagnetics. The complexity
in mathematical modeling is four-fold: (1) describing an accurate constitutive
model using phenomenological framework. Here we use a model based on the
density of domain switching (DDS) [14], where the series expansion of the Gibbs
free energy functional for cubic non-polar crystalline Laves phase is used along
with peak piezomagnetic coeﬃcient on the compressive part of the stress acting
along the resultant magnetic ﬁeld vector (2) including the eﬀect of the volume
fraction of the magnetostrictive phase in the dilute composite and microstructural pattern (3) retaining only the essential properties of the small scales and
nonlinearity and (4) constructing a variationally consistent ﬁnite element model
and solving it iteratively.

Constitutive Model Based on Density of Domain
Switching (DDS)

We consider an unit cell of the two phase composite as shown in Fig. 1, in which
the ellipsoidal inclusion (B) in matrix phase (A) is the aggregate of magnetostrictive domains. The eﬀective orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld in these domains is
assumed to be at an angle θ which is also the major axis of the ellipsoid. We

consider an eﬀectively one-dimensional constitutive model of A along the major
axis of the ellipsoid. Also, this major axis is assumed to be aligned with the
resultant magnetic ﬁeld H under equilibrium. Using the DDS model [14] it is
possible to capture the eﬀect of large magnetostriction more eﬀectively than the
other models. According to the DDS model, the piezomagnetic coeﬃcient for the
phase B can be written as

volume fraction of phase B. Applying the mixture rule of rank-one laminate
structure under the applied stress components {σ11 , σ22 , σ12 } and magnetic ﬁeld
components {H1 , H2 } in the unit cell, the constitutive model is obtained, which
is expressed in the quasi-linearized form

We adopt a quasi-linearization process during time stepping to track the evolution of the morphology in the composite ﬁlm. Here we ﬁrst write the coeﬃcients

from the previous time step at t = ti−1 = ti − ∆t as e¯iB = e¯B ( , σ i−1 , H i−1 ),

µiAB = µAB ( , σ i−1 , H i−1 ). In the subsequent formulation we use the notations:
A.B = Aij Bjk , A : B = Aij Bji as the contraction of tensors over one and two
indices, respectively. |A| := (A : A)1/2 . We then rewrite the constitutive model
in the coordinate system of the cell (e1 , e2 ) as function of the eﬀective angle of

where Γ ε is the transformation tensor for strain and stress, Γ H is the transformation tensor for magnetic ﬁeld vector. Because of the domain switching, the Euler
angle θi varies over time, which we intend to compute as θi = tan−1 Hyi−1 /Hxi−1
where (x, y) (e1 , e2 ) and (x, y, z) is the global coordinate system of the composite ﬁlm.
The electrical source behind the magnetostrictive eﬀect is assumed to be due
to the transverse magnetic (TMz ) mode of excitation through array of electrodes parallel to the ﬁlm plane. We exclude the eﬀect of TE and TEM modes
of electromagnetic excitation resulting from any anisotropy in the composite
ﬁlm. Hence H = {Hx (x, y, t) Hy (x, y, t) 0}T with pointwise prescribed electrical loading (Ez (z, y, t)). These should satisfy one of the Maxwell equation for

Multiscale Model and Approximate Inertial Manifold

It is important to note that the magnetostriction due to domain switching and
the resulting nonlinearity vanishes as → 0. In such case, the quasi-linearization
of the constitutive law in Eq. (3) results in a linear system whose eigen values
are close to that of the slow manifold and a global attractor can be established.
Therefore, for → 0, it is straightforward to obtain a fairly accurate solution
based on center manifold reduction by asymptotic expansion and truncation
according to the order of the terms in the PDEs. But in the present case, our
objective is to study the ﬁlm dynamics due to large variation in spatially or
for individual designs with diﬀerent constituents and manufacturing processes.
Therefore, by following the known facts from the reported literature (see [15] and
the references therein), we focus our attention on constructing an approximate
inertial manifold with global convergence properties in a two-scale ﬁnite element
framework.

We introduce a slow scale (L0 ) and a fast scale (L1 ) with the dependent
variables deﬁned in them respectively as (.)0 and (.)1 , such that

In order to introduce the eﬀect of texture of the composite, we perform homogenization. Simplifying Eq. (8) with the help of Eqs. (3) and (5) and homogenizing

The property of the texture in Eq. (9) is given in terms of the known distribution
function ψθ and ψ . While evaluating Eqs. (11)-(12) we need projection of the
nodal variables on the sub-grid nodes. This is done by a least-square ﬁt over the
ﬁnite element nodal variables ue(i−1) , H e(i−1) at time t = ti−1 for the elements

Finite Element Formulation

So far we have just assumed that the values of the ﬁnite element nodal variables
q e = {ueT H eT }T from the previous time step t = ti−1 are known. In order to
solve for the variables at t = ti the ﬁnite element equilibrium is now required.
First we rewrite Eqs. (11)-(12) as respectively
L1 (∂t , ∂t 1 )g(u0 , u1 ) − L2 (∇0 , ∇1 )p(ε0 , ε1 , H 0 , H 1 ) = 0 ,

(14)

L3 (∇0 , ∇1 )g(ε0 , ε1 , H 0 , H 1 ) = 0 ,

(15)

The ﬁnal step to obtain our two-scale ﬁnite element model is the variational
minimization of the weak form, which can be written in the form

which leads to the global ﬁnite element equilibrium equation
¨ e0 + M 1 q
¨ e1 + K 0 q e0 + K 1 q e1 = f .
M 0q

(17)

Eq. (17) is further condensed out by eliminating the magnetic ﬁeld vector H e
by using the pointwise magnetic excitation condition in Eq. (5) rewritten as

In the present problem when → 0, the dynamics is that of semilinear elliptic
PDEs in (u, H), hence usual bi-linear element with mesh density comparable
with the wavenumber of the magnetic excitation is suﬃcient to produce accurate result. However, such properties no longer hold for → 1. Also, ∇ is not
bounded. A suitable approach in related context of obtaining an approximate
manifold (h) is to ﬁx the spatial discretization at a given time step and obtain
the approximate solution
u = u0 + u1 = u0 + h(u0 ) ,

(19)

through iteration. In order to derive the condition to iterate over h while solving
Eq. (17), we take help of apriori error estimates. Since such an error estimate
should ideally be independent of the choice of the scales, i.e. irrespective of the
fact that the system is slow (or fast) in that scale [16], we ﬁrst set u0 = 0, H 0 =
0. Neglecting the inertia terms in the strong form corresponding to Eqs. (11)-(12)
and rearranging, we get
∇1 .ε1 = Ri1 : ε + Ri2 : H 1 ,

∇1 .H 1 = Ri3 : ε + Ri4 : H ,

(20)

where Ri1 , Ri2 , Ri3 and Ri4 are functions of ( , θi , σ i−1 , H i−1 ) at time t = ti−1 .
We consider a strong estimate
