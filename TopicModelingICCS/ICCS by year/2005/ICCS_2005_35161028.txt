Abstract. The protein-protein interaction data available today in databases were
either determined by experimental methods or predicted by computational
methods. Biologists studying a certain mechanism or function are usually
interested in a small-scale network of protein-protein interactions related to the
mechanism or function of their interest rather than a genome-wide network of
protein-protein interactions. We have previously developed a database server
that can predict interactions between the proteins submitted by a user. However,
the server cannot find proteins from the databases that potentially interact with
a protein given by a user. Finding potentially interacting proteins with a protein
of interest is more useful than finding interactions between given proteins, but
more difficult partly because it involves intensive computation of searching
data in the databases and because different databases have different accession
numbers and names for a same protein. This paper describes the new online
system for predicting interacting proteins with a user-specified human protein
and its preliminary results. We believe that this is the first online system for
predicting interacting proteins with a given protein and that it is a useful
resource for studying protein-protein interactions.

1 Introduction
A genome-wide network of protein-protein interactions in higher species such as
human is very huge and complex, and therefore subnetworks of smaller-scale are
usually preferred to a whole network for close examination. However, small-scale
subnetworks of protein-protein interactions of interest are not readily available from
databases partly because computing all possible subnetworks involves prohibitive
computation of searching data in the databases and because different databases have
different accession numbers and names for a same protein.
We previously developed a database called the human protein interaction database
(HPID; http://www.hpid.org/) for predicting potential interactions between proteins
submitted by users as well as for providing human protein interaction information
pre-computed from existing structural and experimental data [1, 2]. However, the

previous version of HPID (HPID version 1.0) is not capable of finding potentially
interacting partners for a given protein. As an extension of HPID 1.0, we now present
a new online prediction system that is capable of predicting interacting proteins with a
user-specified human protein. The online prediction system uses the data derived
from HPID 1.0 (http://www.hpid.org/), BIND (http://bind.ca/), DIP (http://dip.doembi.ucla.edu/) and HPRD (http://www.hprd.org/) for human protein interactions. It
also recognizes the protein IDs of EMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/), Ensembl
(http://www.ensembl.org/), HPRD and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to
search for proteins. This paper discusses the main concepts of the work and its results.

2 Searching Interacting Proteins
The protein interactions were determined on the SCOP [3] Protein Structural
Interactome MAP (PSIMAP) [4]. The structural interactions of human proteins were
predicted by a homology-based assignment of the domain structures to the whole
genome.
Unlike HPID 1.0, HPID 2.0 is not dependent on protein IDs to find interacting
partners of proteins. Given a protein sequence, interacting partners with the protein
are found by homology search of protein sequences from relevant databases. HPID
2.0 currently considers Ensembl, BIND, DIP, HPRD, and NCBI as relevant databases
for homology search. To predict interacting partners of a protein, HPID 2.0 first
identifies the domains of the given protein using the information from three databases
of superfamily (http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/) [5], InterPro
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) and Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/). Fig. 1
shows the overall architecture of the HPID online prediction system.

3 Example of Predicting Interacting Proteins
This section shows an example of predicting interacting partners of a protein given by
a user. Suppose that a user wants to know interacting proteins with human protein
ENSP00000046794. HPID finds 17 interacting partners from the experimental data
and 2,101 interacting partners from the prediction data of HPID. 13 out of the 17
interacting partners were also found in the prediction data; that is, the experimental
and prediction data have 13 proteins in common. 4 out of the 17 proteins were not
found in the prediction data. The reason that the 4 proteins were not found in the
prediction data can be explained by the possibility that (1) the proteins have no
superfamily assigned to them, or (2) PSIMAP does not have a pair of interacting
superfamilies associated with the proteins.
Table 1 shows the superfamilies and functions of the 13 interacting partners that
were found both in the experimental and prediction data. The functions of the 13
proteins can be clustered into a few functional groups, which agree with other
research results [9, 10]. HPID also provides the information of superfamily, function,
sub-cellular localization of potential interaction proteins, which can be further
validated by experimental methods.

4 Conclusion
Despite a large volume of protein-protein interaction data, small-scale networks of
protein-protein interactions of interest are not readily available from databases partly
because computing all possible subnetworks involves prohibitive computation of
searching data in the databases and because different databases have different
accession numbers and names for a same protein. We constructed an online prediction
system called HPID 2.0 for searching for interaction partners of a protein given by a
user. The online prediction system uses the data derived from HPID 1.0
(http://www.hpid.org/), BIND (http://bind.ca/), DIP (http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/)
and HPRD (http://www.hprd.org/) for human protein interactions. It also recognizes the protein IDs of EMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/), Ensembl
(http://www.ensembl.org/), HPRD and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to
search for relevant proteins. HPID 2.0 is the first online system for predicting
interacting proteins with a given protein and will be a useful resource for studying
protein-protein interactions.
