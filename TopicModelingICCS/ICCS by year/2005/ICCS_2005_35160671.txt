Abstract. In biological systems the process of symbol grounding is realised at a
neural level. But in case of artificial subjects it must be done by certain
organisations of private data structures and data collections, and by internal data
processing and recognition algorithms. In this work a possible way of
implementation of the well - known problem of symbol grounding is presented.
The idea of an algorithm of grounding formulas in a private agent’s data
structure is given. It is assumed that from the agent's point of view stored
perceptions are the original source of any meaning accessible for cognitive
processes of symbol grounding. This algorithm is used when the state of a
particular object from external world is not known. As a results the logic
formulas with modal operators and descriptive connectives are generated.

1 Introduction
The problem of symbol grounding has been widely discussed in artificial intelligence,
robotics, cognitive science and linguistics [2], but it still fails to practical solution
applied by artificial systems [11]. Complete study of the grounding problem is very
difficult task and practical solutions of this problem seem to be a big challenge. In
biological systems the process of grounding is realised at a neural level. But in case of
artificial subjects it must be done by certain organisations of private data structures
and data collections, and by internal data processing and recognition algorithms [1].
The symbol grounding is strictly related to the problem of generating statements
about the external world. According to the cognitive linguistics and the
phenomenology of knowledge each external formula generated by the cognitive agent
needs to be grounded in relevant knowledge structures. These relevant structures are
called the grounding experience of the related formula [9]. In this case a descriptive
language consisted of logic formulas with modal operator of belief or possibility one
is taken into account. External formulas are the reflection of agent grounded opinion
about the current state of external world. They describe the states of object from
external world. Such an approach to define the epistemic concept of belief is an
alternative way to definition of formulas’ semantics, because each formula is treated
by the cognitive agent as true, if and only if this formula is satisfied by the overall
state of agent-encapsulated knowledge [4], [5]. In this work a possible way of

grounding descriptive language, represented by the algorithm for grounding formulas
in the agent’s knowledge structures, is proposed. This algorithm uses consensus in the
agent’s knowledge structures, is proposed. This algorithm uses consensus methods
[3]. The process of grounding is carried out when the state of particular object from
external world is not known for an agent and the empirical verification is not possible.

2 Assumptions
It is assumed that the agent is independent entity equipped with sensors and situated
in some world. This world is consisted of the atomic objects O={o1,o2,...,oZ}. Each
object oz∈O at the particular time point tn∈T, T={t0,t1,t2,..} possesses or doesn’t
posses the property Pi∈P, P={P1,P2,...,PK}. The states of the objects from O are a
target of agent’s cognitive processes.
2.1 Agent’s Internal Organization
The states of the objects from external world at the particular time point tk are
remembered by the agent in the structure called base profile BP(tn).
Definition. Let the base profile be given as the following system of mathematical
relations:
BP(tn)= <O,P+1(tn),P−1(tn),P±1(tn),...,P+K(tn),P−K(tn),P±K(tn)>,

(1)

It is assumed that:
1. O={o1,o2,...,oZ}, where each o denotes a unique cognitive representation of a
particular object of the world W.
2 For each i=1,2,...,K, relations P+i(tn)⊆O, P−i(tn)⊆O, P+i(tn)⊆O hold. For each oz∈O
+
the relation oz∈P i(tn) holds if and only if the agent has perceived that this object oz
−
possesses atomic property Pi. For each oz∈O the relation oz∈P i(tn) holds if and
only if the agent has perceived that this object oz does not posses the atomic
±
property Pi. For each oz∈O the relation oz∈P i(tn) holds if and only if the agent
doesn’t known the state of an object oz in relation to the property Pi.
Obviously, for each i=1,2,...,K, the conditions P+i(tn)∩P−i(tn)=∅, P+i(tn)∩P±i(tn)=∅,
−
P i(tn)∩P±i(tn)=∅ hold.
All base profiles are ordered and stored in agent’s private temporal database
KS(tc).
Definition. The overall state of stored perceptions is given as a temporal data base:
KS(tc) ={BP(tn): tn∈T and tn≤tc}.

(2)

2.2 Agent’s Language of Communication
The agent is provided with the descriptive language of communication. This language
makes it possible for an agent to generate the external messages (logic formulas).

Grounding a Descriptive Language in Cognitive Agents Using Consensus Methods

673

Definition. The agent’s language is defined as a pair L:
L ={A,F},

(3)

where A denotes the alphabet consisted of terms O={o1,o2,...,oZ}, descriptive
connectives: negation (¬), conjunction (∧), exclusive alternative (∨) and alternative
(∨); modal operators of belief (Bel) and possibility (Pos). F denotes the set of logic
formulas:
F =Φ∪Π,

(4)

where Φ is a set of formulas with belief (Bel) operator:
Φ={Bel(Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)), Bel(Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz)),Bel(¬Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)), Bel(¬Pi(oz)∧
¬Pj(oz)), Bel(Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz)), Bel(Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz))}

(5)

For example if the agent at the time point tc generates the message
ϕc=Bel(Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)) it is equivalent to the spoken language: I belief that the object oz
at the time point tc possesses the property Pi and property Pj.
Π is a set of logic formulas with possibility operators:
Π={Pos(Pi(oz)∧ Pj(oz)), Pos(Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz)), Pos(¬Pi(oz)∧ Pj(oz)),
Pos(¬Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz))}

(6)

For example if the agent at the time point tc generates the message
ϕc=Pos(Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)) it is equivalent to the spoken language: It is possible that object
oz at the time point tc possesses both the property Pi and Pj. Each formula is
interpreted from the agent's point of view as external, logical representation of beliefs
on the current state of the object oz∈O [4], [5]. It is assumed that at the same time tc it
is possible to generate the only one message with belief operator and few with the
possibility one.

3 The Idea of an Algorithm for Grounding Formulas
In this section the idea of the algorithm for grounding formulas will be given. If the
state of particular object oz∈O is not known, then the grounding algorithm is used.
This algorithm is consisted of six steps [6], [7], [8]:
Step 1. Elimination of perceptions
All the base profiles BP(tn), in which the state of an object oz in relation to the at least
one property Pi or Pj is not known, are rejected. In this way the set KS’(tc) is created.
Definition. The set SW’(tc) of base profile is defined as:
SW’(tc) ={BP(tk)| ((oz∈P+i(tk) and oz∈P+j(tk)) or (oz∈P+i(tk) and oz∈P−j(tk)) or
(oz∈ P−i(tk) and oz∈P+j(tk)) or (oz∈P−i(tk) and oz∈P−j(tk)) and k ≤ c, i,j∈K, i≠j}.

(7)

674

A. Pieczynska-Kuchtiak

According to (7) SW’(tc) is the set of all base profiles in which the state of an object
oz was known for an agent in relation to the both properties Pi and Pj.
Step 2. Classification of perceptions
All the base profiles from KS’(tc) are grouped into four classes Cm(tc), m=1,2,3,4 of
observations. The criterion of the membership of particular base profile BP(tn) to the
proper class Cm(tc) is the state of the object oz in relation to the properties Pi and Pj.
In particular, the following classes of base profiles are taken into account:
a) C1(tc) ={BP(tn):
tn≤tc and BP(tn)∈KS’(tc) and both oz∈P+i(tn) and oz∈P+j(tn) hold for BP(tn)}
1
Class C (tc)of data consists of all base profiles BP(tn) stored up to the time point tc, in
which the object oz has been found as having both properties Pi and Pj.
b) C2(tc) ={BP(tn):
tn≤tk and BP(tn)∈KS’(tc) and both oz∈P+i(tn) and oz∈P−j(tn) hold for BP(tn)}
c) C3(tc) ={BP(tn):
tn≤tc and BP(tn)∈KS’(tc) and both oz∈P−i(tn) and oz∈P+j(tn) hold for BP(tn)}
4
d) C (tc) ={BP(tn):
tn≤tc and BP(tn)∈KS’(tc) and both oz∈P−i(tn) and oz∈P−j(tn) hold for BP(tn)}
Interpretations for C2(tc), C3(tc) and C4(tc) are similar to C1(tc).
Each class Cm(tc) is semantically correlated with one logic formula without modal
operator in the following way:
Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz) is related to the content of C1(tc)
Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz) is related to the content of C2(tc)
Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz) is related to the content of C2(tc)
¬Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz) is related to the content of C3(tc)
¬Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz) is related to the content of C4(tc)
Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz) is related to the content of C5(tc)=C2(tc)∪C3(tc)
Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz) is related to the content of C6(tc)=C1(tc)∪C2(tc)∪C3(tc)

(8)

Step 3. Consensus profiles computing
For each class Cm(tc), m=1,2,3,4 an agreement of the knowledge called consensus
profile CBPm(tc), m=1,2,3,4 is computed. In order to determine consensus profiles
some postulates need to be applied. See Section 4.
Step 4. Distance between each consensus profile and current base profile computing
The agent computes the distance dm, m=1,2,3,4 between each consensus profile
CBPm(tc) and current base profile BP(tc). This distance reflects numerical similarity
between each consensus profile and current base profile. One of the possible ways for
determining such distance is computing of the total cost of transformation one object
into another. In this case transformation CBPm(tc) into BP(tc) is based on the objects
movements between the sets cP+im(tc), cP−im(tc) and cP±im(tc) in order to obtain the sets
P+i(tc), P−i(tc) and P±i(tc).
Step 5. Choice function value computing
The agent computes the values of the choice function Vw(X), w=1,2,...,6. Each of
these value is derived from a subset of {d1,d2,d3,d4}:

Grounding a Descriptive Language in Cognitive Agents Using Consensus Methods

V1(X) is derived for Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz) from the set of distances X={d1}
V2(X) is derived for Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz) from the set of distances X={d2}
V3(X) is derived for ¬Pi(oz)∧ Pj(oz) from the set of distances X={d3}
V4(X) is derived for ¬ Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz) from the set of distances X={d4}
V5(X) is derived for Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz) from the set of distances X={d2,d3}
V6(X) is derived for Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz) from the set of distances X={d1,d2,d3}

675

(9)

The aim of this step is to create the set of logic formulas without modal operators that
are considered as candidates for external messages. Smaller the average value of
distances of the set X and the variance of distance values of the set X bigger choice
function value.
Step 6. Decision procedure
The formula with belief operator is chosen as external, for which the correlated choice
function value is maximal. If there are more than one maximal choice function, value
the cardinality of the related class of perceptions Cm(tc) are taken into account. If these
cardinalities are mutually closed then all formulas with possibility operator are chosen
as external.

4 Consensus Profiles Computing
In the algorithm for grounding formulas some conceptions from the theory of
consensus have been applied [3], [10]. In the third step of this algorithm for each class
of perceptions the consensus profile CBPm(tc), m=1,2,3,4 is computed. Consensus
profile is an agreement of the knowledge stored in each class Cm(tc). On this stage of
an algorithm the knowledge that is represented by the set of base profiles into single
profile is transformed.
Definition. Let the consensus profile be given as:
CBPm(tn)= <O,cP+1m(tn),cP−1m(tn),cP±1m(tn),...,cP+Km(tn),cP−Km(tn),cP±Km(tn)>,

Each postulate PSy is divided into two parts: in the first parts the set of premises is
specified and in the second – the conclusions. The premises represent some conditions
that should be fulfilled in order to execute the action from conclusions.

Definition. (postulate’s fulfillment)
The postulate PSy, y∈{1,2,...,7} is fulfilled by the structure S if and only if at
least one of the following condition holds:
1. All the premises δ = {δ1,...,δx} and all the conclusions φ ={φ1, ...,φz} of the
postulate PSy: δ = {δ1,...,δx} are true:
S |= PSy if and only if (¬∃ δi∈δ | δi =bool false) and (¬∃φi∈φ | φi =bool false),
2. At least one premise of the postulate PSy, y={1,2,…,7} is false.

(11)

S |= PSy if and only if (∃ δi ∈ δ | δi =bool false )
where:
i, x, z ∈ N
S∈US=UCxUCBP
UC is universe of the all class of perceptions Cm(tc)
UCBP is universe of all consensus profiles
δ - set of all premises of the postulate PSy
φ - set of all conclusions of the postulate PSy
4.1 Postulates for Consensus
In order to determine consensus profile CBPm(tc) some rational requirements
(postulates) need to be applied. Following postulates are taken into account:
Postulate PS1 (unanimity of knowledge)
If object oz possesses (doesn’t posses) the property Pi in each base profile
BP(tk)∈Cm(tc), k≤c, then in a consensus profile CBP(tc) possesses (doesn’t posses) the
property Pi.
Postulate PS2 (superior of knowledge)
If object oz possesses (doesn’t posses) the property Pi in at least one base profile
BP(tk)∈Cm(tc), k≤c and there doesn’t exist base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), k≤c, k≠n, in
which the object oz doesn’t posses (possesses) the property Pi, then in a consensus
profile CBP(tc) the object oz possesses (doesn’t posses) the property Pi.
Postulate PS3 (the rule of majority)
If the number of base profiles BP(tk)∈Cm(tc), k≤c in which the object oz possesses
(doesn’t posses) the property Pi is bigger then the number of base profiles
BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), k≤c, k≠n, in which the objects oz doesn’t posses (possesses) the
property Pi, then in a consensus profile CBP(tc) the object oz possesses (doesn’t
posses) the property Pi.
Postulate PS4 (the rule of majority of knowledge)
If the number of base profiles BP(tk)∈Cm(tc), k≤c in which the object oz possesses
(doesn’t posses) the property Pi is bigger then the number of base profiles
BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), k≤c, k≠n, in which the objects oz doesn’t posses (possesses) the

property Pi the state of an object oz is unknown, then in a consensus profile CBP(tc)
the object oz possesses (doesn’t posses) the property Pi.
Postulate PS5 (restrictive rule of majority of knowledge)
If the number of base profiles BP(tk)∈Cm(tc), k≤c in which the object oz possesses
(doesn’t posses) the property Pi is bigger then the sum of the number of base profiles
BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), k≤c, k≠n, in which the objects oz doesn’t posses (possesses) the
property Pi and the base profiles BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), k≤c, k≠n, in which the state of an
objects oz is unknown then in a consensus profile CBP(tc) the object oz possesses
(doesn’t posses) the property Pi.
4.2 Algorithm for Determining Consensus Profile
Taking the postulates PS1-PS5 into account the algorithm for the consensus profile
computing is given. In consequence the structure S is obtained that fulfills the
postulates PS1-PS5.
Algorithm (consensus profile computing)
Input: The set Cm(tc)⊂SW(tc), m∈{1,2,3,4}
Output: The structure S={Cm(tc), CBPm(tc)}, m∈{1,2,3,4},S∈US, Us is universe of all
structures S.
Start.
Let cP+im(tc)=cP−im(tc)=cP±im(tc)=φ, P+i(tn)∈BP(tn), P−i(tn)∈BP(tn), P±i(tn)∈BP(tn),n≤c .
For each property Pi∈P
For each object oz∈O
Step 1.
If in each base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc) oz∈P+i(tn) then cP+im(tc):=cP+im(tc)∪{oz}.
Step 2.
If in each base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), oz∈P−i(tn) then cP−im(tc):= cP−im(tc)∪{oz}.
Step 3.
If there is at least one base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), in which oz∈P+i(tn) and there
doesn’t exist any profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), in which oz∈P−i(tn), then
cP+im(tc):=cP+im(tc)∪{oz}.
Step 4.
If there is at least one base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), in which oz∈P−i(tn) and there
doesn’t exist base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), in which oz∈P+i(tn), then
cP−im(tc):=cP−im(tc)∪{oz}.
Step 5.
If the number of base profiles BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), in which oz∈P+i(tn) is bigger then the
number of base profiles BP(tk) in which oz∈P−i(tk), then cP+im(tc):= cP+im(tc)∪{oz}.
Step 6.
If the number of base profiles BP(tn)∈Cm(tc), in which oz∈P−i(tk) is bigger then the
number of base profiles BP(tk) in which oz∈P+i(tn), then cP−im(tc):=cP−im(tc)∪{oz}.

Step 7.
For each base profile BP(tn)∈Cm(tc): cP±im(tc):=cP±im(tc)∪P±i(tn) ∪(P+i(tn)\cP+im) ∪
( P−i(tn)\cP−im(tc)).
Stop.

5 Conclusions
Although the problem of symbol grounding has been studied for quite a long time,
there is still a lack of mathematical models for simplest languages’ grounding.
The aim of this paper was to investigate the problem of grounding modal formulas
generated individually by the agents after applying dedicated algorithm. Presented
algorithm uses consensus methods and represents the process of grounding logic
formulas in agent’s knowledge structures. These formulas describe the states of
objects from external world in relation to some properties. Proposed solution realises
also an original way of defining semantics of modal formulas, because logic formulas
are related to the internal representations of an object rather than to ontologically
existing entity.
