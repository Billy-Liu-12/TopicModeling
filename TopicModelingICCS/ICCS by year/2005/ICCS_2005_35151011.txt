Abstract. Although there exist many phasing methods for unrelated
adults or pedigrees, phasing and missing data recovery for data representing family trios is lagging behind. This paper is an attempt to ﬁll this
gap by considering the following problem. Given a set of genotypes partitioned into family trios, ﬁnd for each trio a quartet of parent haplotypes
which agree with all three genotypes and recover the SNP values missed
in given genotype data. Our contributions include (i) formulating the
pure-parsimony trio phasing and the trio missing data recovery problems,
(ii) proposing two new greedy and integer linear programming based solution methods, and (iii)extensive experimental validation of proposed
methods showing advantage over the previously known methods.
Keywords: haplotypes, genotypes, SNP, family trio data, phasing.

Introduction

In diploid organisms (such as human) each chromosome has two ”copies” which
are not completely identical. Each of two single copies is called a haplotype,
while a description of the data consisting of mixture of the two haplotypes is
called a genotype. The underlying data that forms a haplotype is either the full
DNA sequence in the region, or more commonly the values of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in that region. A SNP is a single nucleotide site where
two or more (out of four) diﬀerent nucleotides occur in a large percentage of the
population.
In general, it is costly and time consuming to examine the two copies of
a chromosome separately, and genotype data rather than haplotype data are
only available, even though it is the haplotype data that will be of greatest use
for investigating complex diseases. Data from m sites (SNPs) in n individual
genotype are collected, where each site has one of two alleles denoted by 0 and 1
(the case of three- and four-allelic SNPs can be reduced to the biallelic case). The
input to the phasing problem consists of n genotype vectors, each of length m,

where each value in the vector is either 0,1, or 2. The position in the genotype
vector has a value of 0 or 1 if the associated chromosome site has that allele
on both copies (it is a homozygous site), and has a value of 2 otherwise (the
chromosome site is heterozygous).
Usually, genotype data miss certain SNP values due to failures during genotyping. Although the missing data rate decreases, still unavailable SNP values
constitute a substantial part of the entire data (as large as 16% of the genotype
data in Daly et al. [4] data and 10% in Gabriel et al. [5]). The problem of missing
data recovery attracts a great deal of attention [9, 14].
Commonly, genotype data represent family trios consisting of the two parents
and their oﬀspring since that allows to recover haplotypes with higher conﬁdence.
A simple logical analysis allows to substantially decrease uncertainty of phasing.
For example, for two SNPs in a trio with parent genotypes f = 22 and m = 02,
and the oﬀspring genotype k = 01, there is a unique feasible phasing of the
parents: f1 = 10, f2 = 01, m1 = 01, m2 = 00 such that the haplotypes f2 and
m1 are inherited by the oﬀspring. In fact, it is not diﬃcult to check that logical
ambiguity exists only if all three genotypes have 2’s in the same SNP site.
Although there exist many phasing methods for unrelated adults or pedigrees, phasing and missing data recovery for trios is lagging behind. We have
tried several well-known computational methods for phasing Daly et al. [4] family trio data, but, surprisingly, all of them give infeasible solutions with high
inconsistency rate.
This paper deals with problems of phasing and missing data recovery on
family trios data. Formally, given a set of genotypes partitioned into family
trios, the Trio Phasing Problem (TPP) requires to ﬁnd for each trio a quartet
of parent haplotypes which agree with all three genotypes. Trio Missing Data
Recovery Problem (TMDRP) asks for the SNP values missed in given genotype
data.
Our contributions include
– Formulating the Pure-parsimony Trio Phasing Problem(PTPP) and the Trio
Missing Data Recovery Problem (TMDRP).
– Proposing two new greedy and integer linear programming (ILP) based
methods solving PTPP and TMDRP.
– Extensive experimental validation of proposed methods and comparison with
the previously known methods.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes
the previous works on phasing and missing data recovery in family trio data. In
Section 3 we describe pure-parsimony trio phasing problem and propose greedy
and ILP based method to solve it. In Section 4 we present our experimental
study of the suggested methods on simulated and real data.

Previous Work

In this section we overview previous research and on phasing based on statistical
methods (Phamily and PHASE, HAPLOTYPER, HAP and greedy algorithms).
The ILP based approaches will be discussed in the next section.
Stephens et al. [16] introduced a Bayesian statistical method PHASE for
phasing genotype data. It exploits ideas from population genetics and coalescent
theory that make phased haplotypes to be expected in natural populations. It
also estimates the uncertainty associated with each phasing. The software can
deal with SNP in any combination, any size of population and missing data
are allowed. The drawback of this method is that it takes long time for large
population
Acherman et al. [1] described the tool Phamily for phasing the trio families
based on well-known phasing tool PHASE [16]. It ﬁrst uses the logical method
described above to infer the SNPs in the parental haplotypes. Then oﬀspring
genotypes are discarded while the parental genotypes and known haplotypes are
passed to PHASE. Because the oﬀspring genotypes are discarded, PHASE no
longer can maintain parent-oﬀspring trio constraints resulting in 8.02% error
rate for phasing Daly et al [4] data.
Niu et al [15] proposed a new Monte Carlo approach HAPLOTYPER for
phasing genotype data. It ﬁrst partition the whole haplotype into smaller segments then use the Gibbs sampler both to construct the partial haplotypes of
each segment and to assemble all the segments together. This method can accurately and rapidly infer haplotypes for a large number of linked SNPs. The
drawback of HAPLOTYPER is that it can not handle lengthy genotype with
large population. It limits 100 SNPs and 500 population.
Halperin et al. [9] used the greedy method for phasing and missing data recovery. For each trio the author introduce four partially resolved haplotypes with
the coordinates 0, 1 and ?. The values of 0 and 1 correspond to fully resolved
SNPs which can be found via logical resolution from the section 1, while the ?’s
corresponds to ambiguous and missing positions. The greedy algorithm iteratively ﬁnds the complete haplotype which covers the maximum possible number
of partial haplotypes, removes this set of resolved partial haplotypes and continues in that manner. The authors replace each genotype in Daly et al [4] data
with a pair of logically partial resolved haplotypes referring to each ambiguous
SNP value as a ?. The ?’s constitute 16% of all data. Then extra 10% of data
are erased (i.e., replaced with ?’s) and the resulted 26% of ambiguous SNP values are inferred by the greedy algorithm minimizing haplotype variability within
blocks. When measured on the additionally erased 10% of data, the error rate for
the greedy algorithm is 2.8% [9] which has been independently conﬁrmed in our
computational experiments. Unfortunately, the error rate o for the original 16%
of ?’s is at least 25% which has been measured by the number of inconsistently
phased SNPs. This may lead to a conclusion that the complexity of missing
genotype data is considerably higher than the complexity of the successfully
genotyped data.

Pure-Parsimony Trio Phasing

Note that it is easy to ﬁnd a feasible solution to TPP but the number of feasible
solutions is exponential and it is necessary to choose a criteria for comparing
such solutions. In [13] for haplotyping pedigree data, the objective is to minimize recombinations. That objective is not suitable for TPP since the trios are
not full-ﬂedged pedigree data and contain no clues to evidence recombination
reconstruction. Thus, following [3, 6], we have decided to pursue parsimonious
objective, i.e., minimization of the total number of haplotypes.
The drawback of pure parsimony is that when the number of SNPs becomes
large (as well as the number of recombinations), then the quality of pure parsimony phasing is diminishing [6]. Therefore, following the approach in [7], we
suggest to partition the genotypes into blocks, i.e., substrings of bounded length,
and ﬁnd solution for the pure parsimony problem for each block separately. Note
that in case of family trios we have great advantage over the method of [7] since
we do not need to solve the problem of joining blocks. Indeed, for each family
trio we can make four haplotype templates (partially resolved by logic means of
haplotypes) that imply unique way of gluing together blocks to arrange complete
haplotypes for the entire sequence of SNPs.
3.1

Problem Formulation

Formally, let genotype be a vector with m coordinates each corresponding to an
SNP and having one of the following values: 0 (homozygote with major allele),
1 (homozygote with minor allele), 2 (heterozygote), or ? (missing SNP value).
Let haplotype be a vector with m coordinates where each coordinate is either 0
or 1. We say that two haplotypes explain a genotype if
– for any 0 (resp. 1) in the genotype vector, the corresponding coordinates in
the both haplotype vectors are 0’s (resp. 1’s),
– for any 2 in the genotype vector, the corresponding coordinates in the two
haplotype vectors are 0 and 1,
– for any ? in the genotype vector, the corresponding coordinates in the haplotypes are unconstrained (can be arbitrary).
We say that four haplotypes h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 explain a family trio of genotypes
(f, m, k), if h1 and h2 explain the genotype f , h3 and h4 explain the genotype
m, and h1 and h3 explain the genotype k.
Pure-Parsimony Trio Phasing (PPTP). Given 3n genotypes corresponding
to n family trios ﬁnd minimum number of distinct haplotypes explaining all
trios.
3.2

Greedy Method for Trio Phasing

We apply the greedy algorithm from Halperin [9] for trio phasing. For each
trio we introduce four partial haplotypes with the coordinates 0, 1 and ?. The

Phasing and Missing Data Recovery in Family Trios

1015

values of 0 and 1 correspond to fully resolved SNPs which can be found via
logical resolution from the section 1, while the ?’s corresponds to ambiguous and
missing positions. The greedy algorithm iteratively ﬁnds the complete haplotype
which covers the maximum possible number of partial haplotypes, removes this
set of resolved partial haplotypes and continues in that manner. The drawback
of this greed method is to introduce error to trio constraint, even for phasing
with error O(m) to the maximum concentration. In the future, we will try to
modify the greedy algorithm to overcome its shortcoming.
3.3

Integer Linear Program for Trio Phasing

We have implemented the following integer linear program (ILP) formulation
(1)-(4) for pure-parsimony trio phasing. It uses 0-1 variable xi for each possible
haplotype with the minimization objective:
M inimize

xi

(1)

For each trio we introduce four template haplotypes, i.e., haplotypes with the
coordinates 0,1,2 and ?: 0’s and 1’s correspond to fully resolved SNPs, 2’s come
in pairs corresponding to the genotype 2’s and ?’s correspond to unconstrained
SNPs. For each 2 in each template we introduce a 0-1-variable y and a constraint
binding it with the variable y corresponding to the complimentary 2:
y+y =1

(2)

Instead of completely resolving templates, we can resolve only 2’s. Then several haplotypes can ﬁt partially resolved templates and at least one of the corresponding x-variables should be set to 1. This results in the following constraint:
For any y-assignment of 2’s in each template T ,
x≥1+
x fits all y s in template T

yi − |I1 | +
i∈I1

(1 − yi ) − |I2 |

(3)

i∈I2

We should guarantee that each template is resolved. This is done by the
following constraint: For each template T ,
x≥1

(4)

x fits template T

Experimental Results

In this section we compare our greedy and ILP based methods suggested in Section 3 with previously known phasing methods such as Phamily [1], PHASE[16]
and HAPLOTYPER[15] applied to phasing and missing recovery on family trio
data. We ﬁrst describe the test data sets then give experimental results of ﬁve
methods for phasing and then for missing data recovery of family trio data.

Test Data Sets

Our algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated data. The data set collected
by Daly et al. [4] is derived from the 616 kilobase region of human Chromosome
5q31. Another real data set is collect by Gabriel et al. [5]. This data consists of
genotypes of SNPs from 62 region. This data set contains about 10% missing
data.
The simulated data is generated using ms [10], a well-known haplotype generator based on the coalescent model of SNP sequence evolution. The ms generator emits a haplotype population for the given number of haplotypes, number
of SNPs, and the recombination rate. We have simulated Daly et al. [4] data
by generating 258 populations, each population with 100 individuals and each
haplotype with 103 SNPs, then randomly choosing one haplotype from each
population. We only simulate parents’s haplotypes, then we obtain family trio
haplotypes and genotypes by random matching the parental haplotypes.
4.2

Family Trio Phasing Validation

It is clear how to validate a phasing method on simulated data since the underlying haplotypes are known. The validation on real data is usually performed
on the trio data. E.g., a phasing method is applied to parents (respectively, to
oﬀspring) genotypes and the resulted haplotypes are validated on oﬀspring’s
(respectively, on parents’) genotypes. Unfortunately, in our case, one can not
apply such validation since a trio phasing method may rely on both oﬀspring
and parents’ genotypes. Therefore, we suggest to validate trio phasing by erasing randomly chosen SNP values and recording the errors in the erased SNP
sites. In Tables 1, 2, 3, each row corresponds to an instance of real data (Daly

percent of erased data (0% - no data erased, 1%-10% - percent of SNP values
erased).
The value of phasing errors is measured by the Hamming distance from the
method’s solution to the closest feasible phasing. In Tables 1 and 2, for parents
(P) we report the percent of SNP values that should be inverted out of the total
number of SNP values that should be inferred (i.e., number of 2 plus number of
unknown values). For oﬀspring (C), we report the percent of SNP which should
be inverted with respect to the total number of SNPs. The total number of errors
(T) is the percent of SNP’s that should be inverted in order to obtain a feasible
phasing solution.
In Table 2, we also report true error for phasing simulated genotype data
which is the Hamming distance between inferred and actual simulated underlying
haplotypes for oﬀspring (C), for parents (P) and the total error (T).

Missing Data Recovery in Family Trios

Table 3 compares ﬁve methods (ILP, Greedy, Phamily, PHASE and HAPLOTYPER) on trio missing data recovery on the real data sets (Daly [4] and Gabriel
[5]) and simulated data. We erase random data in trio genotypes with certain
amount(1%, 2%, 5% and 10%) of the entire data. We report the error as the
number of incorrectly recovered erased positions of the genotypes on oﬀspring
(C*), parents (P*) and trios (T*) divided the total number of erased positions in
parent genotypes in percentage. We count only half error if the compared paired
SNP is 2 and 0 (or 1).

Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we have shown that existing methods for phasing and missing
data recovery for the data representing family trios are not satisfactory. We
have formulated the pure-parsimony trio phasing and the trio missing data
recovery problems, proposed two new greedy and integer linear programming
based solution methods, and experimentally validated of proposed methods
showing advantage over the previously known methods. It has been shown that
the simple greedy algorithm is very stable in missing data recovery while the
ILP method is superior in trio data phasing. Our future work will include design of new methods which will combine the feasibility and stability of ILP and
greedy methods.
