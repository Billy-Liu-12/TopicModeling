Abstract. In this paper a realistic cellular automata model is proposed to simulate traffic flow at single-lane roundabouts. The proposed model is built on fine
grid Cellular Automata (CA), so it is able to simulate actual traffic flow more
realistically. Several important novel features are employed in our model.
Firstly, 1.5-second rule is used for the headway (=distance /speed) in carfollowing process. Secondly, vehicles movement on urban streets are simulated
based on the assumption of speed changes following a Gaussian (normal) distribution and is calibrated with the field data. Thirdly, driver behavior is modeled by using a truncated Gaussian distribution. Numerical results show that our
method is feasible and valid.

1 Introduction
Roundabouts, regarded as complex subsystems, are important components of complex urban networks. The most important control rule in roundabouts is yield-at-entry
[1], i.e. vehicles from the secondary roads give way to the vehicles on the circulatory
road. Both empirical and theoretical methods [1] have been proposed to measure
roundabouts performance such as capacity, delay, queue length, etc. With regard to
these methods, the gap-acceptance criteria such as in [2, 3] are commonly used. Gapacceptance models are, however, unrealistic in general assuming that drivers are consistent and homogenous [4]. A consistent driver would be expected to behave in the
same way in all similar situations, while in a homogenous population, all drivers have
the same critical gap (the minimum time interval between two major-stream vehicles
required by one minor-stream vehicle to pass through) and are expected to behave
uniformly. The limitations of gap-acceptance models have been analyzed and detailed
in literature [5]. Thus, in this paper we focus on using a Cellular Automata (CA)
model to simulate traffic flow at an urban roundabout.
The employment of CA modeling traffic flow at roundabouts has attracted attention in the last few years [4-9], due to its dynamical and discrete characteristics [10]
and its connection with stochasticity [11]. For a roundabout, vehicle maneuvers may
include driving on the roads and on the roundabout.
Vehicles moving on the roads can be seen as driving on a straight urban road.
Many models, such as in Ref. [7, 12, 13] have been developed to deal with driving on
urban networks. To our knowledge, previous models normally implicitly assume that

the headways (=distance/speed) are 1 second, that is, 2-second rule is not considered
in those models. Theoretically, it should be observed by all drivers, although the
headways that drivers use are shorter than 2 seconds [14] and normally longer than 1
second in the real world. In our research we have recorded 10 hours of traffic data
between 16 August 2004 and 27 August 2004. The average car-following headway of
1.5 seconds has been observed in local urban networks and this 1.5-second rule has
been built into our model.
Wang and Ruskin [5] proposed a Minimal Acceptable sPace (MAP) method to
simulate interactions between drivers at single-lane roundabouts. The method is able
to simulate heterogeneous driver behavior and inconsistent driver behavior. In their
model, driver behavior is randomly classified into four categories: conservative, rational, urgent and reckless, and each group has its own MAP. Meanwhile, inconsistent
driver behavior is simulated by reassignment of categories with given probabilities at
each time step. Although the assumption to categorize driver behavior into four
groups is coarse, this approach, as far as we know, is the first model to reveal the
impact of driver behavior on traffic flow at roundabouts.
Literature [7] proposed a stochastic CA interaction model. With this model, a waiting vehicle can enter the roundabout only if there are no vehicles on the roundabout in
its left side quadrant. Obviously, this assumption is questionable. Each time step in
the model is equivalent to 2 seconds. Clearly, the model is not able to describe traffic
flow in details, such as acceleration or deceleration. A time step in micro-simulation
is recommended between 0.1 and 1 second [2].
A simpler entry rule is also presented in [6], that is, if the cell located in front of
the entrance is not occupied by the vehicle, a waiting vehicle is randomly generated
and the cell is occupied. However, the yield-at-entry rule is not abided by and the
speed of the following one on the circulatory lane is not considered, therefore, their
model is unlikely to be a safety model.
We proposed a Normal Acceptable Space (NAS) model in this paper to describe
heterogeneous driver behavior under normal conditions. The value of NAS is the
number of required cells on a circulatory lane for a vehicle from a secondary road to
enter the roundabout. The deviation of the NAS is used to model inconsistent driver
behavior.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, several important novel features
are employed. Firstly, the average headway of 1.5 seconds is built into our model.
Secondly, driver behavior and vehicle movement are modeled using a (truncated)
Gaussian distribution. In this way, we present interaction rules at roundabouts according to the left-side driving such as in UK, Australia, and New Zealand. In Section 3,
vehicle movement on urban roads is calibrated by field data and interaction models
are also calibrated using field data provided in [19]. Furthermore, a comparison with
other models is given and the result shows that our model is approximately consistent
with other models. The conclusion is given in Section 4.

2 Model Formulations
In this paper a shorter length of cells is used in our model. In other words, the finer
discretization of cells in our CA model is used comparing with previous models. The

422

length of each cell is equal to 1 m in a real road, which provides a better resolution
modeling actual traffic flow than other models. A unit of speed is therefore equal to
3.6 km/h and each time step is 1 second. Since 1 unit of acceleration is 1 m/s2, this
also corresponds to a ‘comfortable acceleration’ [15].
In urban networks, a lower speed should be considered due to speed constraints.
Normally, the legal limit of speed in urban networks is 50 km/h, however some people will drive at speeds about 58 km/h, which is just below the limit (61 km/h) of
being apprehended. Therefore, in our model, we assume the maximum speed of each
vehicle is in the range of 50.4 km/h – 57.6km/h. The speed corresponds to the number
of cells, which a vehicle can move forward to in 1 second. The number of cells is 1416 cells.
Different vehicle types have different numbers of cells in lengths. Following are
average values based on 10-hour recording data sets at morning peak hour and these
are adopted in this paper.

2.1 Modeling Driver Behavior Under Gaussian Distribution
As mentioned above, driver behavior is inconsistent, namely, even under similar conditions a driver may behave differently with time. So a driver can accept a space
which value is shorter than the NAS due to long waiting time or other urgent conditions. Sometimes, a driver needs a space, which value is larger than the NAS due to
bad weather, night visibility or other factors.
Let xmin represent the number of minimum acceptable cells and xmax stand for the
number of maximum acceptable cells for a driver to interact with other drivers. If x >
xmax, a vehicle surely enters the roundabout without delay, but there is no interaction
with other drivers. The values less than xmin are rejected due to safety factors and the
values larger than xmax are not included in consideration as no interaction is needed
(free flow). Therefore, the model can be viewed as a truncated Gaussian distribution
[16], where the left and right parts have been cut off. Mathematically, the truncated
Gaussian distribution can be written as follows:
f ( x) =

1

σ 2π

( x− µ )2

e

2σ 2

x min

≤

x ≤

x max

(1)

where µ is the value of the NAS and σ is the value of deviation of the NAS.
From the statistical point of view, every vehicle entering roundabouts can be
viewed as an independent event. According to the joint distribution theorem [17], if

driver A follows Gaussian distribution N (µ 1, σ12), driver B follows N (µ 2 , σ22),……,
driver M follows N (µ m , σm2), then for independent drivers A, B,……, M, the joint
distribution of driver A, B,…, M follows Gaussian distribution N (µ, σ2), namely,
A + B + ......

+ M

~ N ( µ ,σ

)

( 2)

Concerning the above assumption, driver behavior can be modeled using Gaussian
distribution. As such the heterogeneous driver behavior and inconsistent driver behavior can be incorporated by NAS and deviations from it.
2.2 Modeling Vehicles Movement on Urban Streets
The attention was mainly focused into modeling two of three phase traffic flow [18],
namely, free flow and synchronized flow. In free flow, a vehicle can drive at its desired speed. In synchronized flow, a vehicle has to follow the vehicle in front. In free
flow, speed changes of all vehicles can be assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution.
This assumption is based on the fact that the speed changes of an individual vehicle
can be approximately seen as a Gaussian distribution, which is described below.
2.2.1 Free Flow Phase
For a vehicle driving between intersections, speed changes are illustrated in Fig. 1,
where five stages are involved in our model. In stage A, acceleration of the vehicle is
delayed due to physical reasons. In stage B, acceleration of the vehicle increases the
speed drastically and leads to the desired speed in stage C. In stage C, speeds randomly fluctuate within the comfortable acceleration/deceleration range [15]. According to the distance between current position and the downstream junction, vehicles are
slow down differently in stages D and E. If the vehicle is following a vehicle in front,
drivers adjust their speed depending upon speed changes of the preceding vehicle.
Speed is adjusted as illustrated in Fig. 1. Probability density of each part follows
Gaussian distribution. Update rules of the nth
vehicle depends on its speed vn(t) at time step t:
1. Speed adjustment
A: vn (t) → vn (t) + 1 B: vn (t) → vn (t) + 2
C: vn(t + 1) → vn(t) – 1 with probability p1 or,
vn(t + 1) → vn(t) + 1 with probability p2 or,
unchanged with probability p3
D: vn (t) → vn (t) – 2 E: vn (t) → vn (t) – 1
Fig. 1. Speed changes of vehicles in terms of the current position and the distance to
the downstream junction. V and X denote the current speed and position, respectively
2.2.2 Synchronized Flow Phase
In synchronized flow, a vehicle has to follow the vehicle in front. Update rules of the
nth vehicle depends on its position xn(t), speed vn(t), and gap (free cells in front) gn(t)
at time step t:
1. Speed adjustment
If gn(t) < vn(t) then: vn(t + 1) → gn(t + 2/3)

424

R. Wang and M. Liu

This rule is based on the 1.5-second rule. In other words, the vehicle can only drive
up to 2/3 of the total distance between the vehicle and the vehicle in front.
Both in free and synchronized flow, the following steps are also implemented to
simulate an overall vehicle movement.
2. Randomization
If vn(t) > 0, then the speed of the n-th vehicle is decelerated randomly with probability pb, i.e. vn(t + 1) → max {0, vn(t) – 1}
3. Vehicle movement
xn(t + 1) → xn(t) + vn(t + 1)
Roundabouts are commonly used in where traffic is not heavy. In other words, the
traffic flow that approach a roundabout are normally either free flow or synchronized
flow, except at the entrance of a roundabout where queues may form. On the roundabout, the flow can be seen as synchronized flow.
2.3 Modeling Interactions for Vehicles Entry Roundabouts
Vehicles are numbered in the circulatory lane, namely, vehicle n+1 precedes vehicle
n. Conditions for vehicle k to enter the roundabout are described here. Vehicle n and n
+ 1 are located on the roundabout, while vehicle n + 1 has passed the entrance and
vehicle n is approaching the entrance. The vehicle k is at the entrance and is waiting
for entering the roundabout. Let lk denote the length of vehicle k, mk(t) denote NAS of
vehicle k, sk,n(t) denote spacing between vehicle k and n at time t. Fig. 2 illustrates the
location of vehicles and the topology of the road, and the roundabout. Concerning the
above considerations, the following update rules are performed in parallel for all
simulated vehicles:
1. Assigning NAS and its deviation for vehicle k according to the probability density of Gaussian distribution.
2. Calculating sk,n(t). If mk(t) ≤ sk,n(t) and lk ≤ sk,n+1(t), the waiting vehicle k can enter the roundabout or if lk ≤ sk,n+1(t), vehicle k can also enter the roundabout, otherwise
vehicle k could not enter the roundabout.
3. If vehicle k is waiting for entry, the update rule at each time step is as follows:
mk(t) = mk(t) - σk if a generated random number R (0≤R≤1) < p, p is the predefined number within[0, 1], otherwise mk(t) = mk(t) + σk ,where mk(t) and σk are NAS
(mean) and its deviation of vehicle k.

3 Experimental Results
The preliminary work is to calibrate vehicle movement on a straight lane. Fig. 3
shows observed single-vehicle movement and its simulation by using the proposed
method. We found that when p1 = p2 = 0.3 and p3= 0.4, the dual-regime of acceleration and deceleration of our simulation results fits the real behavior of vehicles well,
especially in the initial acceleration and final deceleration phases. Probability density
of each stage (see in Section 2.2) is assumed to follow Gaussian distribution.

Next we apply our model to a case study. Experiments were implemented for
36000 time steps (equivalent to 10 hour) for a street-length of 100 cells on all approaches. The NAS of all drivers ranges within [xmin, xmax], where xmin, xmax are taken
as 16 and 26 cells in terms of field observation. The mean and deviation of the truncated normal distribution are assumed to be 20 and 2 cells.
To carry out a realistic simulation, many input parameters are required, such as vehicles components, occupied cells, turning rate, arrival rate, etc. We use the data provided in [19] to verify our CA model, where vehicles types and component are given.
Table 2 shows comparisons of capacity, delay, and queue length. We can find that
capacity has an increase in our model, correspondingly, delay and queue length decrease slightly. For further verifying our model, a comparison with other models
(aaSIDRA, UK Linear Regression, HCM 2000, NAASRA 1986) is given in Fig. 4,
where capacity of roundabouts computed using our CA model is basically consistent
with other models.

4 Summary
In this paper, we propose a realistic CA model to simulate traffic flow at an urban
roundabout. Several important novel features are employed in our model. Firstly, it
has been observed that the average headway of car-following is 1.5 seconds in local
urban networks and this 1.5-second rule has been used in modeling the car-following
process. Secondly, vehicle movement along urban streets is simulated based on the
assumption that speed changes follow a Gaussian distribution. Thirdly, heterogeneous
driver behavior and inconsistent driver behavior are modeled using the truncated
Gaussian distribution.
Vehicle maneuver on urban roads has been calibrated using field data. The simulation results show that the dual-regime of acceleration and deceleration of the model
fits with the real world well.
In order to model a realistic simulation, vehicle arrival rates, turning rates, vehicle
types, driver behavior and categorization of speed, etc. are built into our model. The
numerical results indicate that the performance (delay and queue length) of roundabouts can be described well.
