Abstract. Based on the work of Krishna and Rosenthal (1996) about combinatorial auctions bidding equilibrium analysis and Che’s (1993) research about
one-unit multi-attributes auctions, we construct a multi-attributes procurement
combinatorial auction (MAPCA) for 2 objects, through a first-score, sealed-bid
format. There are two kinds of bidders: n simple bidders and m diverse bidders
considered in this model. With some assumptions, we finally obtain the equilibrium bidding strategies for the both two kinds of bidders.

1 Introduction
Combinatorial auctions have been applied in a variety of environments involving
economic transactions, and they have the potential to play an important role in electronic procurement transactions for supply chain management. Examples are Net
Exchange (www.nex.com) who procures transportation services for Sears Logistics
(Ledyard et al. 2002), procurement combinatorial auctions for truck services at
Home Depot (Elmaghraby and Keskinocak 2003), and IBM’s procurement combinatorial auction for Mars Incorporated (Hohner et al. 2003). The characteristics of
combinatorial auctions that we will treat in the procurement context are items involving multiple attributes. Comparing with normal combinatorial auctions, the
property of multiple attributes is somewhat unique in procurement auctions. When
an auctioneer procures items by auctions, she may allow the potential suppliers to
bid for various products bundles, which is called Procurement Combinatorial Auctions (CAs).
The topics on one-unit auctions’ bidding strategies and winning probability are
abundantly addressed. However, discussions about CAs’ bidding strategies are inadequate. Krishna and Rosenthal (1996) considered situations where multiple objects are
auctioned simultaneously by means of a second-price sealed-bid auction, and derived
the bidding equilibrium strategies for the synergy bidder. Rosenthal and Wang (1996)
studied a simultaneous-auction model with synergies, common values, and constructed strategies. Che (1993) studies design competition in one item procurement by
developing a model of two-dimensional (price and quality) auctions. The purpose of
this paper is to discuss bidding strategies in a specific multi-attributes procurement
CA setting.

2 The Model
In this model, there are 2 identical objects to be procured by a first-score sealed-bid
auction. And two kinds of bidders, i.e. simple bidder and diverse bidder are considered. Each simple bidder is interested in only one object, while each diverse bidder,
say diverse bidder j, is interested in these two objects with synergy effect. For each
object, there are n interested simple bidders. We can also regard the situation as two
identical auctions started in two separated rooms; each room has n simple bidders,
and diverse bidders are apt to bid in both rooms. Each bidder has a privately known
supply cost function for the object. Other assumptions are as follows.
2
Bidding vector is { p, q} ∈ R+ , p, q denote bidding price and quality-bid separately.
Especially, quality-bid, in our model, is a unified number to measure all non-price
factors of the objects. The scoring function of the bidding vectors has a quasi-linear
form

S ( q, p ) = s ( q ) − p .

(1)

where s (.) is strictly increasing with respect to q.
Number of simple bidders, for each object, is n; number of diverse bidders is m.
The cost function of simple bidder i is c(q,θ i ) . θ i denotes type of simple bidder i ,
which is private information of bidder i , and θ i is drawn from interval [θ ,θ ] with

identical distribution F (.) , which is common knowledge. c(.,.) is increasing with
respect to q and θ i . Type of diverse bidder j is denoted as θ j which is drawn from
interval [θ g ,θ g ] with the identical distribution Fg (.) ; θ j is also private information.
The cost function of the diverse bidder is cg (q,θ j ) for each object. [θ g ,θ g ] and
Fg (.) are common knowledge; c g (.,.) is increasing with respect to q and θ j .
If winning, profit of simple bidder i , with bid { p, q} ∈ R+ , is
2

π i ( q, p ) = p − c ( q ,θ i ) .

(2)

Profit of the diverse bidder j, with bid { p, q} ∈ R+ , is

⎧
if win one
⎪ p − c g (q,θ j ),
.
⎨
⎪2 p − 2c g (q,θ j ) + α j , if win both
⎩

(3)

where α j , i.e., synergy effect, is a non-negative constant which is diverse bidder j’s
private information.
With type θ i , simple bidder i’s bidding strategy is formula (4): [Riley and
Samuelson, 1981; Che, 1993; Chen and Huang 2004]

Diverse bidders know each other’s profit function form, but do not know other diverse bidders’ synergy effect value, say α j , which are drawn from [0, α ], and their
identical distribution Fα (.) is common knowledge. The model constructed above is
called MAPCA in this paper.

3 Bidding Strategy Analysis
For simple bidders, Let S0 (θ i ) ≡ max[ s (q) − c(q,θ i )], ∀θ i ∈ [θ ,θ ] . By using envelope
theorem, S 0 (.) is a strictly decreasing function, therefore its inverse function exits. Let
vi ≡ S 0 (θ i ) , vi can be regarded as scoring capability of simple bidder i. Let
H (vi ) ≡ 1 − F ( S0 (vi )) , then distribution F (.) of θ i is transformed into distribution
−1

H (.) of vi. Let b ≡ S (q s (θ i ), p) , where q s (θ i ) = arg max[ s(q) − c(q,θ i )] . Obviously, b
is the score evaluated by the bidding of simple bidder with type θ i . Let B (.) denote
the scoring function with the independent variable vi, and B (.) is strictly increasing
with vi. Define G (.) ≡ H ( B −1 (.)) and L(b) = {H ( B −1 (b))}n for convenience. Intuitively,
L(b) is the probability of all n simple bidders who are interested in one of the two
items get score less than b.
Similarly, for diverse bidders, let S g (θ j ) ≡ max[ s (q ) − c g (q,θ j )], ∀θ j ∈ [θ g ,θ g ] . By
envelope theorem, S g (.) is a strictly decreasing function, therefore its inverse function exits. Let v ≡ S g (θ j ) , v is scoring capability of diverse bidder j. Let
H g (v) ≡ 1 − Fg ( S0 (v)) , then distribution Fg (.) of θ j is transformed into distribution
−1

H g (.) of v, which also implies that the one-to-one mapping relationship from v to θ .
Let b ≡ S (qs (θ j ), p) , where q s (θ j ) = arg max[ s (q ) − c g (q,θ j )] , and b is the score of the
bidding by diverse bidder with type parameter θ j . Let Bg (v) denote the scoring func−1

tion with v, and Bg (.) is strictly increasing with v. Define G g (.) ≡ H g ( Bg (.)) and
−1

K (b) ≡ {H g ( Bg (b))}m −1 . Actually, K (b) is the probability of all other m-1 diverse
bidders get score less than b. Note that p − c(q s (θ j ),θ j ) = v − b , and then we have the
expected revenue of any diverse bidder with type θ j who bids quality-bid q s and price
p as follows,

On-line Multi-attributes Procurement Combinatorial Auctions Bidding Strategies

581

π (( q s , p ) θ j )
= L2 ( s (q s ) − p) × K ( s (q s ) − p ) × ( 2( p − c) + α j )

.

(5)

+ 2 L( s (q s ) − p) × (1 − L( s( q s ) − p )) × K ( s( qs ) − p ) × ( p − c)

where, qs represents quality bidding, p is price bidding, c denotes the corresponding
cost with quality bidding qs. Now, we would show an important proposition (lemma
1) to illustrate any diverse bidder with any specific type, say θ j , will report qualitybid to maximize s (q) − c g (q,θ j ) .
LEMMA 1. The diverse bidder with type θ j follows the bidding strategy in which
quality-bid q s (θ j ) is

qs (θ j ) = arg max[s(q) − cg (q,θ j )] .

(6)

Proof: Assume there exists another equilibrium strategy ( q, p ) , and q ≠ qs (θ j ) , then
construct a bid (q' , p ' ) ,
where q ' = qs (θ j ),
Note

p' = p + s (qs (θ j )) − s (q) .

(7)

S ( q ' , p ' ) = S ( q, p ) = S .

(8)

Then, with bid (q' , p ' ) , the expected revenue of diverse bidder is below,

π (( q ' , p ' ) θ j )
= L2 ( S ) K ( S )[2( p + s (q s (θ j )) − s (q) − c g (q' )) + α j ]
+ 2 L( S )(1 − L ( S )) K ( S )( p + s (q s (θ j )) − s (q) − c g (q' ))

.

(9)

= L2 ( S ) K ( S ){2 × [( p − c g (q) + ( s (q s (θ j )) − c g (q s (θ j )) − ( s (q) − c g (q)))] + α j }
+ 2 L( S )(1 − L ( S )) K ( S )[( p − c g (q) + ( s (q s ) − c g (q s (θ j )) − ( s (q1 ) − c g (q)))]
Note qs (θ j ) = arg max[ s (q) − cg (q,θ j )] , therefore,

π ((q' , p' ) θ j ) ≥ L( S ) K ( S ) ⋅{L( S )[2( p − cg (q)) + α j ] + 2(1 − L( S )) ⋅ ( p − cg (q))}

(10)

Thus, we have

π ((q' , p' ) θ j ) ≥ π ((q, p) θ j ) .

(11)

This completes the proof.

□

Without loss of generality, let s (qs (θ j )) = 1 ; from LEMMA 1 and (5), we know the
optimization problem of the diverse bidder with type θ j can be expressed as follows:

582

J. Chen and H. Huang

maxπ ((qs , p) θ j )
p

= max{L(1 − p) ⋅ K (1 − p) ⋅[(L(1 − p) ⋅ (2( p − c) + α j ) + 2(1 − L(1 − p)) ⋅ ( p − c)]} .
p

(12)

= max{α j L2 (1 − p)K (1 − p) + 2L(1 − p)K (1 − p)( p − c)}
p

where c denotes the corresponding cost of the diverse bidder with her equilibrium
quality-bid q s (θ j ) ; c is also the optimal cost of the bidder. Actually, qs (θ j ) and c are
determined by type θ j uniquely. Let l (.) = L ' (.), k (.) = K ' (.) , by first derivative of
(12) with respect to p, we have
α ⋅ l (1 − p) ⋅ K (1 − p ) + α j ⋅ L(1 − p ) ⋅ k (1 − p ) / 2 − K (1 − p )
dπ
= c − p − L(1 − p) ⋅ j
dp
l (1 − p ) ⋅ K (1 − p) + L(1 − p ) ⋅ k (1 − p )
.

(13)

=0

Now considering the relationship between the optimal cost c of diverse bidder with
θ j and her price bid p, from (13) we have
c = p + L(1 − p ) ⋅

α j ⋅ l (1 − p) ⋅ K (1 − p ) + α j ⋅ L(1 − p ) ⋅ k (1 − p ) / 2 − K (1 − p )
l (1 − p) ⋅ K (1 − p ) + L(1 − p ) ⋅ k (1 − p )

.

(14)

Actually, (14) is the correspondence from optimal cost c to possible optimal price bid
p, and we can abstractly express (14) as c = c p ( p) . The only special feature used in
the argument is that c p (.) is convex. Convexity of c p (.) is not easy to characterize in
terms of the primitive assumptions of our model. However, if G g (.) and G (.) are
uniform distribution, then the function c p (.) is indeed convex. If c p (.) is not convex,
the situation becomes more complicated and worth pursuing in the future correlated
works. Therefore, if c p (.) is convex, then there exit at most 2 roots of equation (14).
Corresponding to different optimal cost c, denote pg (c) as the solutions of (14).
*

Define pg (c ) as the unique root or greater one of the two roots, i.e.,

⎧
⎪ p g (c), for unique solution
*
p g (c ) = ⎨
.
⎪max{ p g (c)}, for other case
⎩

(15)

By convexity of c p (.) , the derivative of dπ dp is non-positive at the point of the
greater root. That means the second derivative of expected revenue with respect to p,
at the greater root, is non-positive. It is the second-order sufficient condition for local
*
maximizer. Consequently, we are sure that p g (c) is the local maximizer, while the
smaller root is not.

More specific, let α = 2 , that means α j ∈ [0,2] . And consider the excessive case
in which the diverse bidder j’s cost is 0 and α j = 2 , for individual rationality, the
price bidding of her will not less than -1. Therefore we assume the domain of p is
[−1,1] . Assume Gg (.) and G (.) are all uniform distributions, then Gg (.) = (1 − p) / 2 ,
G (.) = (1 − p ) . Correspondingly, we have

K (1 − p) = ((1 − p ) / 2) m −1 , p ∈ [−1,1] , L(1 − p) = (1 − p) n , p ∈ [0,1] ,
k (1 − p ) = [(1 − m) / 2] ⋅ [(1 − p) / 2]m − 2 , l (1 − p) = −n ⋅ (1 − p ) n−1 .
Note that, when p ∈ [−1,0] , the diverse bidder will definitely surmounts all simple
bidders with probability 1. Then (12) can be rewritten as
max π ((q s , p ) θ j ) = max[α j ⋅ K (1 − p) + 2 ⋅ K (1 − p ) ⋅ ( p − c)] .

(16)

Therefore, formula (14) can be expressed as follows

The convexity of (17) is obvious. Define p g (c) as the solution (price bidding) of (17)
in the domain p ∈ [−1,0] .
Since the domain of expected revenue (16) is a closed set, in order to find the
global maximizer, what we should do is to compare the boundary solutions with interior solution. Next, define c * as follows,
c * = max{c : π (0 c) −π ( p g (c) c) ≥ 0} .
*

(18)

Because

d{π (0 c) −π ( p g (c) c)}
*

dc

= −2 K (1) + 2 L(1 − p g (c )) ⋅ K (1 − p g (c)) < 0 .
*

*

(19)

It follows that if there exits c * , such that

π (0 c * ) − π ( p g ( c * ) c * ) = 0 .
*

(20)

then for all c: 0 < c < c * , we have

π (0 c ) > π ( p g ( c ) c ) .
*

(21)

Define another special cost point c − as follows
c − = max{c : π ( p g (c) c) −π (0 c) ≥ 0} .

(23)

It follows that if there exits c − , such that

π (0 c − ) − π ( p g ( c − ) c − ) = 0 .
−

(24)

Then for all c: 0 < c < c − , we have

π (0 c ) < π ( p g ( c ) c ) .
−

(25)

Basically, in order to compare boundary solutions with interior solutions, we defined c * and c − respectively. In other words, c * is the separating cost point below
which zero price bidding is better than positive interior solution, while c − is the separating cost point below which negative price bidding is better than zero price bidding.
The following result is immediate.
Theorem 1. The following constitutes an equilibrium of MAPCA.
a) The simple bidder with type θ i follows the strategy as (4);
b) The diverse bidder with type θ j follows the strategies:

⎧qs (θ j ) = arg max[ s (q) − c g (q,θ j )]

(26)

Intuitively, theorem 1 illustrates that one bidder either with synergy effect or not
will submit same flavor quality-bid, i.e., optimal quality to maximize the difference of
quality score minus the corresponding cost. As to price bidding, two kinds of bidders
are apt to bid lower price when they have lower optimal cost. However, there exists
two special cost “jump” points to make diverse bidders bid relative lower price: zero
price or negative price. It is not so strange if we consider the situation in which synergy effect is very strong for any specific diverse bidder. The synergy effect can be
regarded as business reputation, advertisement considerations and market share competition, which depends on different business surroundings.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we construct a multi-attributes procurement combinatorial auction
(MAPCA) for 2 identical objects, through a first-score, sealed-bid, simultaneous format. There are two kinds of bidders, simple bidder and diverse bidder, are considered
in our model. With some assumptions, we obtain the equilibrium bidding strategies

for the two kinds of bidders. Basically, the difference between our work and past
correlated research (Krishna and Rosenthal (1996)) are: multi-attributes vs. single
attribute, first-score vs. second-price, and procurement auction vs. selling auction.
Also, this piece of research can not be realized without Che’s work (Che 1993) about
one-unit multi-attributes procurement auction. Compared with previous work about
multi-attributes procurement combinatorial auctions’ bidding analysis (Chen and
Huang (2004)), this model extends to multiple diverse bidders who have synergy
effect in the auction. Future work includes extensions to heterogeneous items assumption of our model.
