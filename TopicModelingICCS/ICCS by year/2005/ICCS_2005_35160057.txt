Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to explore a time-split hybrid
Galerkin scheme for the atmospheric shallow water equations. A nonlinear variant of operator integration factor splitting is employed as the
time-stepping scheme. The hyperbolic system representing slow modes
is discretized using the discontinuous Galerkin method. An implicit second order backward diﬀerentiation formula is applied to Coriolis and
gravity wave terms. The implicit system is then discretised using a continuous Galerkin spectral element method. The advantages of such an
approach include improved mass and energy conservation properties.
A strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme is applied for substepping.

Introduction

The seminal work of Robert (1981) led to a six-fold increase over the explicit time
step for atmospheric general circulation models. To achieve such dramatic gains
without recourse to a fully implicit integrator, a semi-Lagrangian treatment of
advection was combined with a semi-implicit scheme for the stiﬀ terms responsible for gravity waves. Initially, semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian time-stepping was
applied to hyperbolic problems, discretized using low-order ﬁnite-diﬀerences and
ﬁnite elements. The traditional semi-Lagrangian algorithm implemented in atmospheric models relies on backward trajectory integration and upstream interpolation, Staniforth and Cˆ
ot´e (1991). A potentially lower cost alternative is the
operator integrating factor splitting (OIFS) method of Maday et al. (1990) which
relies on Eulerian sub-stepping of the advection equation. In contrast with semiLagrangian advection, there are no dissipation or dispersion errors associated
with upstream interpolation or trajectory integration and the scheme maintains
the high-order accuracy of the discrete spatial operators.
A discontinuous Galerkin shallow water model employing a nodal basis and
explicit time-stepping is described in Giraldo et al. (2003). Sherwin (2004) demonstrated the advantages of a hybrid Galerkin approach in the context of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Eskilsson and Sherwin (2005) describe a
discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the shallow water equations using thirdorder strong-stability preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta time-stepping. Here, we

investigate a time-split scheme applied to the global shallow water equations in
curvilinear coordinates on the cubed-sphere. A second order backward diﬀerentiation formula (BDF-2) is combined with SSP-RK sub-stepping of a hyperbolic
system. Because the incompressibility constraint has been removed, the fully
nonlinear OIFS scheme of St-Cyr and Thomas (2004) is employed. When compared to continuous Galerkin spectral elements, the hybrid scheme results in
improved mass and energy conservation properties.

Shallow Water Equations

The shallow water equations contain the essential wave propagation mechanisms
found in atmospheric general circulation models. These are the fast gravity waves
and slow synoptic scale Rossby waves. The latter are important for correctly
capturing nonlinear atmospheric dynamics. The governing equations of motion
for the inviscid ﬂow of a free surface are

h is the height above sea level, v is the horizontal velocity and Φ = gh the
geopotential height. f is the Coriolis parameter and k a unit vector in the vertical
direction. The geopotential height is decomposed into a perturbation about a
constant base state, Φ0 .
To exploit the potential of operator integration factor splitting for systems of
time-dependent partial diﬀerential equations, St.-Cyr and Thomas (2004) show
that a fully nonlinear form of the algorithm is more appropriate. Sub-stepping

An accurate representation of fast-moving gravity waves is not required for large
scale atmospheric dynamics and the corresponding terms can be treated implicitly. For a second order BDF-2 scheme, sub-stepping of the rhs terms is not

stepping (3) and (4) on the intervals [tn−1 , tn ] and [tn−2 , tn ]. An implicit equation
for Φn is obtained after space discretization and application of block Gaussian
elimination, resulting in a modiﬁed Helmholtz problem. The coeﬃcient matrix
of this linear system of equations is non-symmetric due to the implicit treatment
of the Coriolis terms and is solved using an iterative conjugate-gradient squared
(CGS) algorithm with a block-Jacobi preconditioner.
For high-order spectral elements, under-integration using Gaussian quadrature results in discrete operators where the eigenvalues corresponding to high
frequency modes are shifted into the right-half plane. A ﬁlter is therefore required to stabilize the time-stepping scheme for long time integrations, Fischer
and Mullen (2001). Strong-stability preserving (SSP) time integration schemes
maintain the non-oscillatory properties of the spatial operator, Gottlieb et al
(2001). We next describe the computational domain, high-order Galerkin ﬁnite
element approximations and SSP-RK sub-stepping.

High-Order Galerkin Approximations

The ﬂux form shallow-water equations in curvilinear coordinates are described in
Sadourny (1972). Let a1 and a2 be the covariant base vectors of the transformation between inscribed cube and spherical surface. The metric tensor is deﬁned as
Gij ≡ ai · aj . Covariant and contravariant vectors are related through the metric
tensor by ui = Gij uj , ui = Gij uj , where Gij = (Gij )−1 and G = det(Gij ). The
six local coordinate systems (x1 , x2 ) are based on equiangular central projection,
−π/4 ≤ x1 , x2 ≤ π/4.
Gij =

where r = (1 + tan2 x1 + tan2 x2 )1/2 and

2000 (1−r/R) meters, where R = π/9 and r2 = min[R2 , (λ−3π/2)2 +(θ−π/6)2 ].

u0 = 20 m/s. The geopotential height ﬁeld after 15 days of integration is
plotted in Fig. 1. The solution is smooth and does not exhibit spurious oscillations.

The implementation of the BDF-2/RK2-3 scheme is still at an experimental
stage. However, it leads to an increase in the model integration rate. Figure 2 is
a plot of the ratio of CNLF and BDF-2/RK2-3 execution times for test case 5.
The eﬃciency gain of BDF-2/RK2-3 over the CNLF scheme is close to a factor of
two. Thomas and Loft (2002) observed that the CNLF scheme integrated twice
as fast as an explicit spectral element shallow water model. Therefore, the total
increase in the model integration rate, when compared to the explicit model, is
a factor of four. The plateau in the eﬃciency curve is due to a growing number
of solver iterations as the time step size increases.

Conclusions

The larger time step permitted by the time-split BDF-2/RK2-3 integrator implies that the hybrid Galerkin discretization is well-suited for modeling multiscale atmospheric phenomena. The computation time is currently dominated by
an increasing number of solver iterations as the time step size increases. However, a recently developed optimized Schwarz preconditioner maintains a much
lower iteration count, St.-Cyr et al (2004). We estimate that this preconditioner
could lead to an additional factor of four improvement in the computational eﬃciency compared to a Crank-Nicholson leap-frog (CNLF) formulation. Although
the hybrid scheme is not strictly conservative, the mass loss is signiﬁcantly less
than in a continuous Galerkin spectral element model.
For parallel computation, a clear advantage of the discontinuous Galerkin
method is the ability to overlap computation with communication. Speciﬁcally,
the communication of conserved variables can be overlapped with the computation of the weak divergence and source terms. We are also currently experimenting with a hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming model for SMP cluster computer
architectures and plan to report these results in the near future.
