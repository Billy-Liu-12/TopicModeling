Abstract. The performance of a continuous-time Recursive Least Squares
(CRLS) and a discrete-time Recursive Least Squares (DRLS) algorithms are
examined for the growth medium temperature control of a cooling batch
bioreactor in which Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth at aerobic condition by
using Continuous-time Generalised Predictive Control (CGPC) algorithm.
MATLAB programme was utilized for recursive parameter identification
algorithms (CRLS and DRLS). The success or otherwise of these algorithms are
estimated using parameter norm criterion for the various order of models and
several input signals. There is a considerable improvement of identification
algorithms with the reduced order of models. It has been shown that the
performance of a DRLS algorithm is as successful as the other recursive
parameter identification of a continuous-time system model.

1 Introduction
In bioprocesses, an organic compound is converted to a valuable product or products
using enzymes or microorganisms called biocatalysts. Since the biocatalysts are very
sensitive to changes occuring in their environment it is inevitable to control the
operating parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and
substrate concentration for maintenance of optimal conditions for product formation
in the complex environment in a bioreactor. Temperature is a fundamental parameter
regulating microorganism growth, kinetics and overall product yield. For this reason
temperature control systems are an integral part of biochemical processes that regulate
the quality and the rate at which can be produced. About 40 % to 50 % of the energy
stored in a carbon and energy source is converted to biological energy (ATP) during
aerobic metabolism, and the rest of the energy is released as heat. Thus heat evolution
is directly related to microbial growth [1].
Batch processes are extensively used to produce specialty chemicals,
biotechnology, pharmaceutical and agricultural products. S.cerevisiae microorganism
which is known as Baker’s yeast is produced by using batch or fed-batch operation
under aerobic conditions [2]. Although setting up, operating and modeling are

available in the literature for batch processes, controlling them is quite challenging. In
addition, these processes exhibit time variant dynamic behavior and recharacterized
by complex, nonlinear physiologial phenomenon that are difficult to model [3,4].
A model may be obtained by examining the internal structure of the system,
although it is often the case that a complete picture cannot be achieved due to
unknown factor, an element which is not directly measurable or an extremely
complicated process [5]. The class and accuracy of a particular model is dependent on
its required application. System identification is an effective procedure for the
modelling of the systems. The model structures must therefore be defined and
evaluations made of the parameters contained within each models. A certain model
structure should approximate the system to a chosen degree and contain all the known
information about operating conditions. It must also be flexible and lead to fast
parameter estimation procedures [6].
Identification of process parameters for control purposes must often be done using
discrete-time computation, from samples of input-output observations. On the other
hand, the process is usually of continuous-time nature, and modelled in terms of
differential equations. In the previously published literatures, several approaches have
been developed for the identification of continuous-time model parameters [7,8,9,10].
The major objective of this study is to identify the recursive parameters of certain
models in MATLAB for control of the temperature in the growth medium. DRLS and
CRLS algorithms are realized for this purpose.

2 Materials and Method
Temperature disturbances range was chosen by taking into account the real
temperature change in the bioreactor during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth at
aerobic condition. Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast (NRRL Y-567)utilized in this
study was obtained from the ARS culture collection (Northern Regional Research
Center, Peoria, IL, U.S.A.). Stock cultures were maintained on agar slants containing
(in g/L): Glucose (20), yeast extract (6), K2HPO4 (3), (NH4)2SO4 (3.35), NaH2PO4
(3.76), MgSO4.7H2O (0.52), CaCl2.4H2O (0.01) and agar (20) (pH 5). The cells
growing on the newly prepared slants were inoculated in to the same liquid medium
(without agar) and cultivated at 32 oC for 24 h in an incubator-shaker.
The bioreactor given in Fig. 1 was modelled in MATLAB. In this experimental
system, bioreactor temperature is measured by a thermocouple. A 2 liters bioreactor
has a cooling jacket. Also sensors were placed in this to measure pH and DO in the
culture medium. Cooling water was continuously fed into the jacket at changing rates
as an input type. Agitation was supplied using a turbine impeller at 600 rpm. An
immersed heater for heating the culture medium to the desired operating temperature
was also placed in the bioreactor. Air was supplied to the bioreactor by passing
through a rotometer and microbiological filter at 1 vvm.
For on-line data acquisition VISIDAQ package programme was utilized. This
programming package consists of Task Designer and Display Designer. The on-line
computer was used in experimental studies. In the theoretical model identification
work was realized by using MATLAB.

3 Continuous-Time Recursive Least Squares Estimation (CRLS)
Continuous-time Generalised Predictive Control (CGPC) was based upon a
continuous-time system model [11]. To be useful in control applications, the system
model parameters should be iteratively estimated. For control purposes, a continuoustime single input-single output system model was utilized to identify the system. The
model in the laplace domain is then given by

A( s )Y ( s ) = B( s )U ( s ) + E ( s )

(1)

A( s ) = a0 s n + a1 s n −1 + ... + a n −1 s + a n
B( s ) = b0 s m + b1 s m −1 + ... + bm −1 s + bm

(2)

Eq. 1 can be rewritten as differential equation;

The value of the parameter is given as a n = 1 , the estimation process can be given
as linear in the parameters model;

The data vector includes the derivative of input-output data and thus derivation
increases the noise, the new data was obtained by filtering the data vector with a
polynomial. For this purpose, Y(s) was added to (Eq. 1) and than this equation
divided by T(s) polynomial. The rearrange equation was given as follows:
Y ( s ) B( s )U ( s )
Y ( s) E (s)
=
+ [1 − A( s)]
+
T (s)
T (s)
T ( s) T (s)

(6)

where the conditions are deg(T)≥deg(A) and a n = 1 . The rearranged linear model
with the parameters is given as
Y f ( s ) = φ T ( s )θ + ε ( s )

(7)

the new parameter and data vectors are given below respectively;

θ = [b0 , b1 ,..., bm ,− a0 ,−a1 ,...,−a n −1 ]T

φ T (s) =

1
([ s m , s m−1 ,...,1]U ( s )
T (s)

(8)

[ s n , s n −1 ,..., s ]Y ( s ))

(9)

As it is accepted that the parameter estimation vector at time t are given in (Eq. 4),
the estimated output and the prediction error are given in (Eq. 10 and 11) respectively.
yˆ (τ ) = φ T (τ )θˆ(t )

,τ ≤ t

(10)

ε (t , τ ) = y (τ ) − yˆ (τ ) = y (τ ) − φ T (t )θˆ(t )

(11)

The aim is to choose the current estimate θˆ ( t ) such that thus error is minimum

over the range 0 ≤ τ ≤ t . Least squares estimation method considers a cost function
of the following form to achieve this objective. The cost function for CRLS algorithm
is defined as [12];

(

J (θˆ(t ), t ) = e − β c t θˆ(t ) − θˆ0

− β c (t −τ ) 2

ε (t , τ ) d τ

(12)

Where β c ≥ 0 , initial information matrix ( S o ) is a possitive definite symmetric
matrix, θˆ o ( t ) is the initial estimate of θ . The first term is the cost allow us to
include a prior estimate in the algorithm. The second brings in the measured data into
the criterion. β c is the forgetting factor. As time t increases, the effect of old data at
time τ 〈t is discounted exponentially with the elapsed time t − τ .
The main equations for CRLS algorithm are given as;

S( t + T ) = e

In the present work, it is noted that by filtering input-output data with a certain
polynomial, the DRLS algorithm can also be used for continuous-time model
parameters. The main equation for this method were given in the previously published
work [13,14].

4 Results and Discussion
A CRLS algorithm with MATLAB programme was utilized for recursive parameter
identification of a continuous-time system model. A DRLS algorithm was also used
succesfully for the same purpose. Performance of the both identification algorithm
with the estimated models of the system given in Table 1 were investigated
theoretically for square wave input signal. These results were given in (Fig. 2-5).

Affects of model order on performance criteria, parameter error norm ( θ − θˆ / θ ),
were investigated. It is noted that increasing model order reduces the performance of
the both CRLS and DRLS algorithms (Table 2).
The important parameters of the CRLS and DRLS algorithms such as initial
parameter vector, covariance matrix, information matrix, forgetting factor and
sampling period were determined by using trial and error method. Their values are
given 0, 10000, 0.0000001, 0.99, 0.1 respectively.
It is noted that as a new approach, discrete-time identification algorithm can be
used acceptably for evaluation of a continuous-time model parameters. When the
certain values of the parameter such as forgetting factor, filter polynomial etc., which
affect the identification performances was choosen most effectively, the widely used
DRLS algorithm in previously published work has been used successfully for
continuous-time model identification.
