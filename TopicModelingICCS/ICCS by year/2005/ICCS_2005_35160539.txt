Abstract. In this paper, we present an analysis on optimization and
risk management in Communication Networks (CNs). The model is proposed for oﬄine traﬃc engineering optimization, which takes a centralized view of bandwidth allocation, performance control, and risk control
of network proﬁt shortfall. First, we introduce a linear penalty cost in the
CN optimization model and derive the optimal bandwidth capacity with
the penalty cost. Then, we use the mean-variance approach to analyze
the proﬁt shortfall risk in CNs. Finally, numerical results are shown to
reveal the impact of the penalty cost on the CNs performance.

Introduction

Traﬃc engineering is a process to optimize resource utilization and network
performance [1], [2]. It has greatly improved network performance by using the
emerging technologies, such as Multi-Path Label Switching and Optical Channel
Trails [3], [4].
There are two forms of traﬃc engineering: online planning and oﬄine planning. In past works, the oﬄine optimization problem was formulated as a deterministic Multi-Commodity Flow (MCF) model, where demand of each channel
was given as a ﬁxed quantity [5], [6].
Recently, there were some works concerning with the stochastic traﬃc engineering. Mitra and Wang presented a stochastic traﬃc engineering framework
for optimizing bandwidth provisioning and path selection in CNs [7]. Mitra and
Wang also developed an optimization framework for the network service provider

to manage proﬁt in a two-tier market [8]. Mitra and Wang furthered their studies in [7], [8] and developed the eﬃcient frontier of mean revenue and revenue
risk [9]. Wu, Yue and Wang presented a stochastic model for optimizing bandwidth allocation in [10], which took a centralized view of bandwidth allocation,
performance control, and risk of network proﬁt shortfall. They analyzed the loss
rate constraint and risk averseness in the CN optimization model and showed
the impact of the loss rate constraint and the risk averseness on the network
performance.
In this paper, based on the model presented in [10], we introduce a linear
penalty cost in the optimization model for network bandwidth allocation. Whenever there is unsatisﬁed traﬃc demand with the limitation of network bandwidth,
a linear penalty function will be added in the objective function. Next, we study
the risk of the network proﬁt shortfall by using the mean-variance approach [11],
[12]. Finally, numerical results are shown to reveal the impact of the penalty cost
on the network performance.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the
system model that we consider in this paper and present the notations and
preliminaries. In Section 3, we formulate the optimization model and derive the
optimal bandwidth capacity with the linear penalty cost. In Section 4, we analyze
the network proﬁt shortfall risk by using the mean-variance approach. In Section
5, we give some numerical results to show the impact of the penalty cost on the
network performance. Conclusions are given in Section 6.

System Model

A Communication Network (CN) is supposed to have users and a service provider.
The CN should derive its unit revenue by serving demand including voice, packet
data, image and full-motion video. For unit bandwidth capacity allocated to the
network, a unit cost will be charged. For unsatisﬁed traﬃc demand with the
limitation of network bandwidth, a linear penalty cost will be added in the objective function. The objective of this system is to maximize the CN mean proﬁt
of the network.
Let (N, L) denote a CN composed of nodes vi (vi ∈ N, 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) and
links l (l ∈ L), where N is the set of all nodes and L is the set of all links.
Let V denote the set of all node pairs, v ∈ V denote an arbitrary node pair
where v = (vi , vj ) and vi , vj ∈ N , Cl denote the maximal bandwidth capacity of
link l, R(v) denote an admissible route set for v ∈ V , ξs (s ∈ R(v)) denote the
amount of capacity provisioned on route s, Dv (v ∈ V ) denote the traﬃc load
between node pair v ∈ V , bv (v ∈ V ) denote the amount of bandwidth capacity
provisioned between node pair v, which can be routed on one or more routes,
then bv = s∈R(v) (ξs ).
In this paper, we consider the CN to be a whole system. We let b > 0
denote the amount of bandwidth capacity provisioned in the CN, then we have
b = v∈V (bv ). Let D > 0 denote the traﬃc demand in the whole CN, then
we have D = v∈V (Dv ), which is characterized by a random distribution with

Optimization of Bandwidth Allocation in CNs

its probability density function f (x) and cumulative distribution function F (x).
b ∧ D is the actual traﬃc load transmitted in the CN, where ∧ represents the
choice of the smaller between b and D. Let r denote the unit revenue by serving
the traﬃc demand, so the total revenue of the CN is r × (b ∧ D). Let c denote
the unit cost for unit bandwidth capacity allocated in the CN, so the total cost
is c × b. Let q denote the linear penalty cost for each unsatisﬁed traﬃc demand,
so the total penalty cost is q × (D − b)+ , where “ + ” represents the choice of the
positive part of (D − b). To avoid unrealistic and trivial cases, we assume that
r > q > 0, r > c > 0.

Optimal Bandwidth Capacity in the CN with Penalty
Cost

Based on the model presented in [10], in this paper, we add a linear penalty
cost in the optimization model for network bandwidth allocation to evaluate the
system performance. We let q denote the unit penalty cost for the unsatisﬁed
traﬃc demand.
Let π(b, D) denote the random proﬁt function by serving traﬃc demand in
the CN with the linear penalty cost, namely,
π(b, D) = r(b ∧ D) − q(D − b)+ − cb.

(1)

Let Π(b, D) denote the mean proﬁt function with the linear penalty cost as
follows:
b

xf (x)dx + rb

Π(b, D) = r
0

b

f (x)dx

+∞

(x − b)f (x)dx − cb.

The objective function of the system is
Π ∗ = max{Π(b, D)}
b>0

(3)

subject to
P (b ≥ δD) ≥ 1 −

(4)

b ≤ Cmax

(5)

and
where Π ∗ is the optimal proﬁt function. P (b ≥ δD) ≥ 1 − is the loss rate
constraint with δ (0 ≤ δ ≤ 1) and (0 ≤ ≤ 1) as the parameters deﬁned in
[10]. Cmax > 0 is the maximal capacity that can be allocated in the CN.
With the above formulation, we can derive the optimal capacity of bandwidth allocation. First, we analyze the property of the CN mean proﬁt function
Π(b, D).

The ﬁrst order derivative of Π(b, D) with respect to b is given as follows:
dΠ(b, D)
= (r + q − c) − (r + q)F (b).
db

(6)

The second order derivative of Π(b, D) with respect to b is given as follows:
d2 Π(b, D)
= −(r + q)f (b).
db2

(7)

With the assumptions in Section 2, we know that f (b) ≥ 0, r + q > 0, hence,
d2 Π(b, D)
≤ 0.
db2

(8)

Therefore, we can say that Π(b, D) is a concave function of b. So, the optimal
bandwidth capacity without constraints is
r+q−c
r+q

F −1

(9)

where F −1 (·) is the inverse function of F (·).
Finally, if we consider the loss rate constraint and the maximal capacity
constraint as in [10], the optimal bandwidth capacity for the CN is
F −1

r+q−c
r+q

∨ δF −1 (1 − ) ∧ Cmax .

where ∨ represents the choice of the larger value between the two components.

Risk Analysis in the CN with Penalty Cost

The mean-variance analysis, which was ﬁrst introduced by Markowitz [11], had
been a standard tool in ﬁnancial risk management. It uses a parameter α (0 ≤
α ≤ 1) to characterize the risk averseness, which is a quantitative balance between the mean proﬁt and the risk of its shortfall [12]. When α increases from 0
to 1, it indicates the willingness to sacriﬁce the mean proﬁt to avoid risk of its
variance.
Due to the random arrival users, the proﬁt is also uncertain and is dependent
on the distribution of the demand. So, in many cases, the optimal proﬁt can not
been obtained as desired. Based on this, we deﬁne the risk as the deviation from
the optimal proﬁt in this paper.
The random proﬁt function and the mean proﬁt function of the CN are given
by Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) presented in Section 3, respectively. By using the method
of integral by parts, Eq. (2) becomes

The variance proﬁt function can be obtained by the formula given as follows:
2

2

V ar[π(b, D)] = E[(π(b, D)) ] − (Π(b, D)) .

(12)

By using the mean-variance approach to investigate the risk of proﬁt shortfall,
the objective function, which is denoted by Φ∗ , is given as follows:
Φ∗ = max Π(b, D) − αV ar[π(b, D)]
b>0

(13)

where α is the risk averseness parameter, π(b, D) is the random proﬁt function
given by Eq. (1), Π(b, D) is the mean proﬁt function given by Eq. (11), and
V ar[π(b, D)] is the variance function given by Eq. (12).
We consider a fully distributed communication network, where the traﬃc
demand oﬀered to the whole CN forms a Poisson process with arrival rate λ > 0.
The interarrival times are exponentially distributed with rate λ. Let X be a
random variable representing the time between successive demand arrivals in
the Poisson process, then we have the probability distribution function FX (x)
and the probability density function fX (x) of X as follows:
FX (x) =

fX (x) =

1 − e−λx ,
0,
λe−λx ,
0,

x>0
x ≤ 0,

(14)

x>0
x ≤ 0.

(15)

The mean and varianceof the exponential distribution are 1/λ and 1/λ2 ,
respectively.
Based on the assumption of the traﬃc demand, Eq. (11) can be obtained as
follows:
r + q −λb r

Numerical Results

In this section, based on the assumption of traﬃc demand in a CN presented in
Section 4, we give some numerical results to show the impact of the penalty cost
on the network performance.
According to the engineering experience, we choose several diﬀerent arrival
rates to represent the diﬀerent cases of traﬃc load in the CN as follows: λ =
0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9. Where λ = 0.01 represents the case that the traﬃc load in the
CN is low, λ = 0.1 and λ = 0.5 represent the cases that the traﬃc load in the
CN is normal, and λ = 0.9 represents the case that the traﬃc load in the CN is
heavy.

Impact on the Bandwidth Capacity

In this subsection, we study the impact of the penalty cost on the optimal bandwidth capacity of the CN. Note that the optimal bandwidth capacity without
. However, in this paper the optimal
penalty cost presented in [10], is F −1 r−c
r
bandwidth capacity with the penalty cost is given by Eq. (9).
Based on the above preparation, we show the numerical results. We choose
the unit revenue r as the benchmark of the linear penalty cost q. The horizontal
axis (q/r) of Fig. 1 corresponds to the increase of the linear penalty cost. The
ordinate axis (b/b∗ ) of Fig. 1 corresponds to the percentage diﬀerence of the
optimal bandwidth capacity from the benchmark b∗ , where b∗ is the optimal

bandwidth capacity without the penalty cost, and b is the optimal bandwidth
capacity with the linear penalty cost. Our numerical results include the optimal
bandwidth capacity obtained without penalty cost presented in [10], which is
one point in the ordinate axis corresponding to q/r = 0.0 in Fig. 1.
For comparing with the model presented in [10], we choose the CN system
parameters as follows: the unit revenue r = 7.5, the unit cost c = 1.5. Let the
percentage diﬀerence of the penalty cost increase from 0.0 to 1.0 by 0.1 each
step with all other parameters unchanged.
From the numerical results shown in Fig. 1, we can conclude that:
(1) In all curves, the impact of the penalty cost on the bandwidth capacity
increases as the penalty cost increases.
(2) The curve with a smaller arrival rate has a quicker increasing speed than
the curve with a larger arrival rate.
(3) With the same penalty cost, the heavier the traﬃc load in the CN is, the
less the impact of the penalty cost on the bandwidth capacity will be.
Comparing with the results presented in [10] without linear penalty cost, the
numerical results in our paper reveal a distinct impact of linear penalty cost on
the network bandwidth capacity. It implies that if we consider the penalty cost,

546

the CN needs to be allocated more bandwidth capacity to guarantee the network
performance.
5.2

Impact on the Mean Profit Function

In this subsection, we study the impact of the penalty cost on the mean proﬁt
function. Note that the mean proﬁt function Π(b, D) without penalty cost, which
is presented in [10], is given as follows:
b

+∞

xf (x)dx + rb

Π(b, D) = r
0

b

f (x)dx − cb.

However, in this paper the mean proﬁt function with the penalty cost is given
by Eq. (2).
We choose the same system parameters as those given in Subsection 5.1. Let
the percentage diﬀerence of the penalty cost increase from 0.0 to 1.0 by 0.1 each
step with all other parameters unchanged.
We choose the unit revenue r as the benchmark of the penalty cost q. The
horizontal axes of Figs. 2 and 3 correspond to the increase of the penalty cost
q/r. The ordinate axes of Figs. 2 and 3 correspond to the mean proﬁt Π(b, D)
presented in Eq. (16). The unit of the ordinate axes of Figs. 2 and 3 corresponds
to a unit price of the mean proﬁt. Our numerical results include the mean proﬁt
obtained without penalty cost presented in [10], which are the points in the
ordinate axes corresponding to q/r = 0.0 in Figs. 2 and 3.
From the numerical results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, we can conclude that:
(1) In all curves, the impact of the penalty cost on the mean proﬁt function
increases as the penalty cost increases.
(2) The curve with a smaller arrival rate has a quicker decreasing speed than
the curve with a larger arrival rate.
(3) With the same penalty cost, the heavier the traﬃc load in the CN is, the
less the mean proﬁt will be.
Comparing with the model without the penalty cost presented in [10], the
numerical results in our paper reveal a distinct impact of the penalty cost on the
network optimal proﬁt. Moreover, the numerical results with diﬀerent arrival
rates almost have the same increasing speed and impact on the mean proﬁt
function.

Conclusions

In this paper, we presented a stochastic model for optimizing bandwidth allocation in Communication Networks with the linear penalty cost. The model is
proposed for oﬄine traﬃc engineering optimization taking a centralized view of
bandwidth allocation, performance control, and risk of proﬁt shortfall. We have
derived the optimal bandwidth allocation capacity with the linear penalty cost.
We have analyzed the risk averseness in the CNs in the mean-variance framework. We have given numerical results to compare our model with the previous

model presented in [10] and shown the impact of the linear penalty cost on the
network performance. We can conclude that the linear penalty cost has distinct
impact on the network performance. The implications presented in this paper
have good insights for traﬃc engineering design and planning.
