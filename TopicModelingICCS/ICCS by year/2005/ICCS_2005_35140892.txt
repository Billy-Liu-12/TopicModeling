Abstract. In the reliability-risk assessment, the second order reliability index
method and the Conditional Expectation Monte Carlo (CEMC) simulation were
interrelated as a new Level III computational approach in order to analyse the
safety level of the vertical wall breakwaters. The failure probabilities of sliding and
overturning failure modes of the Minikin method for breaking wave forces were
forecasted by approximating the failure surface with a second-degree polynomial
having an equal curvature at the design point. In this new computational
approach, for each randomly generated load and tide combination, the joint
failure probability reflected both the occurrence probability of loading condition
and the structural failure risk at the limit state. This new approach can be
applied for the risk assessment of vertical wall breakwaters in short CPU
durations of portable computers.

1 Introduction
In the structural design of vertical wall breakwaters, two methods have been widely
applied in European countries. The first method is the First Order Mean Value
Approach (FMA) [1], and the second one is the Hasofer-Lind second order reliability
(HL) index. The partial coefficient system utilizes the former and the latter has been
employed to compare risk levels of rubble mound and vertical wall structures [2].
Goda and Tagaki [3] suggested a reliability design criteria in which the Monte Carlo
simulation of expected sliding distance was carried out for caisson breakwaters.
The reliability-risk assessment of Ereğli harbor main breakwater involves the second
order reliability index (βII) method interrelated with CEMC simulation as a Level III
method. In this technique, uncertainties that affected most of the variables in the design
were incorporated throughout the lifetime of structures by the use of the simulation of
design conditions, i.e. the water level change due to tidal action and the random wave
action. This proposed Level III computational methodology was compared with the
individual application of βII (Level II) method.

2 Computational Risk Model
The safety of vertical wall breakwater was evaluated by modelling random resistance and
load variables with common probability distributions at their limit-state. The primary
variable vector z in the normalized space indicates these random variables.

The functional form of the basic variables consistent with the limit state is the failure
function denoted by: g(z)=(z1,z2,...,zn). The safety of the structure can be assured by
designating an admissible value of the probability of achieving the limit state defined by:
g(z)=0. In the reliability-based study, the second-order reliability index method was
utilized, in which the failure surface was approximated by a rotational parabolic
surface. The parabolic limit state surface in standard normal space, g(z) [4] was taken
in the model as follows:
n

n

i =1

i =1

g ( z ) ≈ a 0 + ∑ b i z i + ∑ c i z i2

(1)

where a0,bi, and ci are the regression coefficients of the second-order polynomials; zi
are the standardized normal random variables and n is the number of random
variables. Regression coefficients were obtained by using the response surface
approach in standard normal space [5]. The positive sum of the principle curvatures of
limit state surface at the design point (z*) was expressed as:

Ks =

where, βII is the second-order reliability index, R is the average principal curvature
radius expressed as R=(n-1)/Ks, βI is the first order reliability index βI=αT z* ; Ф is the
standard normal distribution function, φ is the standard normal probability density
function, α is the directional vector at the design point. The structural performance of
the breakwater under the affect of wave loading was investigated by utilizing the
Conditional Expectation Monte Carlo (CEMC) simulation. The exceedance probability
(Pf) of failure damage level was obtained by utilizing the control random variable
vector of zi = (zi1, zi2,…, zik) as follows:
Pf = E z j: j=1,2,...,n

and j≠i

[Pf (z i )]

(5)

where, E[.] is the conditional expectation (mean) and Pf (zi) is the failure probability
evaluated for zi1, zi2,…, zik, by satisfying the conditional term in eqn (6) for the last
control variable as follows:

where, k is the number of control variables in the simulation. A computer program
was developed for the simulations that repetitively reproduced breakwater
performance at the limit state condition until the specified standard mean error of
convergence (ε) was satisfied. The limit state equations for breaking wave forces
acting on the vertical wall breakwaters were derived in this study from the Minikin’s
method [6] as illustrated in Figure (1). For sliding failure mode, the limit state
equation utilized in the model was [7]:

In eqns (7) and (8), dS is the depth from still water level, hs is the height of vertical
wall breakwater, B is the width of wall, µf is the coefficient of friction, γo is the weight
per unit volume of seawater, γc is the weight per unit volume of concrete, Hb is the
breaking wave height, hC is the breaker crest taken as Hb/2, Pm is the maximum
pressure acting at the SWL, d is the depth at a distance one wavelength seaward of
the structure, Ld is the wavelength at the water of depth d.
In the application of the suggested Level III method, the offshore wave height was
randomly generated and a linear wave transformation was carried out to obtain the
design load of the structure. Then, the reliability of the structure was investigated (on
average 30,000 times) by the βII method at the limit state. As a result, the joint failure
risk reflected the occurrence probabilities of wave loading and the limit state for each
random load combination generated in the simulation. Then, the βII method was
applied individually to the case study as a Level II approach and the results obtained
from these methods were compared with each other.

The wave height was modeled by a joint Weibull-Rayleigh probability distribution
with the scale (α) and shape (β) parameters listed in Table (1) by using the wave
characteristics listed in Table (2) [8]. In Table (2), Hb is the breaker height at
construction depth, Ho' is the unrefracted deep-water wave height, M is the plotting
position, Kr is the linear refraction coefficient, Hs and Ts are the annual maximum
significant deep-water wave height and period, respectively. The new Level III
reliability approach, in which the second order reliability index (βII) and the
Conditional Expectation Monte Carlo (CEMC) simulation were interrelated, was
suggested to handle the uncertainties inherent in wave data and design methodology

[9]. Wave characteristics of the site were randomly generated by simulation.
Afterwards, the failure mode probability was predicted by the parabolic limit state
surface having the identical curvature at the design point with the higher degree
failure surface. The mean (µ) and the standard deviation (σ) of the wave height
distribution were µH= 4.77m and σH = 0.95m, respectively. Probabilities of failure of
the Ereğli vertical wall breakwater in 50 years of lifetime obtained by the suggested
Level III approach for both sliding and overturning failure criteria are given in Figure
(4) in which sliding criterion governs the design. The sensitivity study carried out by
using a rank correlation method reveals that the overturning failure function is
sensitive to the wave height with a correlation coefficient of Rc=-0.84 (load variable)
obtained by Level II and Level III methods for sliding criterion under breaking wave forces

and to the weight per unit volume of concrete with Rc=0.46 (resistance variable). The
sliding failure function is sensitive to the wave height with Rc=-0.73 (loading
variable), to the weight per unit volume of concrete Rc=0.22 (resistance variable), and
to the coefficient of friction with Rc=0.57.
For sliding failure criterion, the probability of failure determined from Level II
reliability method is lesser than the probability of failure obtained from Level III
reliability method with a root mean square error of 0.25 and a bias of –0.17 (Figure
5). For overturning failure criterion, the probability of failure obtained from Level III
reliability method is greater than the probability of failure obtained from Level II
method with a root mean square error of 0.32 and a bias of –0.17.

4 Conclusions
A new computational simulation methodology was presented for the design of
breakwaters. For the case study at Ereğli, results obtained from Level II method
deviated from results obtained by simulation. Therefore, structural reliability
evaluated by using Level II method was considered as approximate, when compared
to the Level III method presented in this paper. The type of distribution (Normal or
extreme value) in design parameters of the failure function also effected the reliability
evaluations irrespective of the design level. As a result, the reliability of vertical wall
structures was highly variable and depended upon the unpredictable nature of coastal
storms, the reliability method and distributions utilized in the design.
This new computational method has advantages in practical design applications,
since the random behaviour of structural performance in lifetime can be estimated at
the planning stage. The new computational approach applied in this paper within few
minutes of CPU time in a portable computers, was recommended for the risk
assessment of vertical wall breakwaters.
