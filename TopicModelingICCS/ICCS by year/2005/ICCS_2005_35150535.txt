Abstract. We study the coverage problem from the fault tolerance
point of view for sensor networks. Fault tolerance is a critical issue for
sensors deployed in places where are not easily replaceable, repairable
and rechargeable. The failure of one node should not incapacitate the
entire network.
We propose three 1 fault tolerant models, and we compare them
among themselves, and with the minimal coverage model [8].
Keywords: Coverage, fault tolerance, smart sensors, sensor network.

Introduction

If all sensors deployed within a small area are active simultaneously, an excessive
amount of energy is used, redundant data is generated, and packet collision can
occur on transmitting data. At the same time, if areas are not covered, events
can occur without being observed.
A density control function is required to ensure that a subset of nodes is active
in such a way that coverage and connectivity are maintained. Coverage refers
to the total area currently monitored by active sensors; this needs to include
the area required to be covered by the sensor networks. Connectivity refers to
the connectivity of the sensor network modeled as a graph: the currently active
sensors has to form a fully connected graph such that the collected data can be
relayed to the initiators (the nodes requesting data).
We study the coverage problem from the fault tolerance point of view. Fault
tolerance is a critical issue depending on where the sensors are employed. Sensors
coupled with integrated circuits, known as smart sensors, provide high sensing
from their relationship with each other and with higher level processing layers.
A smart sensor is speciﬁcaly designed for the targeted application [4]. Smart
Sensors ﬁnd their applications in a wide variety of ﬁelds such as military, civilian, bio-medical as well as control systems, etc. In military applications, sensors
can track troop movements and help decide deployment of troops. In civilian

applications, sensors can typically be applied to detect pollution, burglary, ﬁre
hazards and the like.
It is clear that fault tolerance is improtant when maintaining survivability in such applications. The failure of one node should not incapacitate the
entire network. Wireless body sensors implanted in the body must be energy
eﬃcient, utilize bandwidth, robust, lightweight and fault tolerant as they are
not easily replaceable, repairable and rechargeable. Bio sensors need a dynamic,
self-stabilizing network.
Motivation and Contributions. We are interested in the bio-medical domain
where applications of sensors are relatively new. Sensors are already applied
to monitor temperature level, glucose level, organs and its implants, and to detect external agents in the body in connection with cancer and other health
abnormalities. We note that for such body chips to work properly, two-way
communication between external computer controlling sensors and the actual
sensors is needed. There may be tens and hundreds of sensors gathering data,
thus wireless are preferable over wired sensors.
The goal of our paper is to propose several sensor array placement schemes,
which are fault tolerant. Thus despite the presence of limted number of failed
sensors, the system continues to function. We propose three 1 fault tolerant
models, and we compare with each other and with the minimal coverage model[8].
Outline of the Paper. In Section 2, we review related work which has motivated
our paper. Section 3 presents the various parameters for the sensor nodes and
describes their relationship to our models, which are further described in Section
4. In Secton 5 we compare those models, and we ﬁnish with concluding remarks
in Section 5.

Related Work

The nodes in a wireless environment are greatly dependent on the battery life and
power. Therefore, minimizing energy consumption for the network while keeping
its functionality is a major objective in designing a robust, reliable network. But
sensors are prone to failures and disconnection. Only minimal coverage of a
given region without redundancy would make such a network inattractive from
a practical point of view. Therefore it is necessary to not only design for minimal
coverage, on the other hand fault tolerance features must viewed in light of the
additional sensors and energy used.
Given a sensor network deployed in a target area, [2] focused on ﬁnding
whether each point of the area is covered by at least K sensors. [9] extends the
problem further and focuses on selecting a minimum size set of sensor nodes
which are connected in such a way that each point inside the area covered by
the entire sensor network is covered by at least K sensors.
Starting from the uniform sensing range model [8], two models are proposed
using sensors with diﬀerent sensing ranges [7]. Variable sensing range is novel,

Fault Tolerant Coverage Model for Sensor Networks

unfortunately both models are worse in terms of achieving a better coverage.
Also, the second model in [7] requires (for some sensors) that the communication
range to be almost six times larger than the sensing range, otherwise connectivity
is not achieved.
A relay node, also called in the literature, gateway [1] or application node [5],
acts as clusterhead in the corresponding cluster. In [3] a fault-tolerant relay node
placement scheme is proposed for wireless sensor networks, and a polynomial
time approximation algorithm is presented to select a set of active nodes, given
the set of all the nodes.
In [6] the project of building a theoretical artiﬁcial retina made up of smart
sensors is described. The sensors should form a tapered array that should rests on
retina and produce electrical signals which are converted by the underlying tissue
into chemical signals to be sent to the brain. The sensor array is therefore used
for both reception and transmission in a feedback system. The challenges with
these sensors are the wireless networking, distribution, placement and continuing
operation of these sensors.

Preliminaries

Two parameters are important for a sensor node: the wireless communication
range of a sensor rC , and the sensing range rS . They generally diﬀer as values,
and a common assumption is that rC ≥ rS . Obviously, two nodes u and v,
whose wireless communication ranges are rCu , respectively rCv , can communicate
directly if dist(u, v) ≤ min(rCu , rCv ).
In [8], it is proven that if all the active sensor nodes have the same parameters
(radio range rC and sensing range rS ) and the radio range is at least twice of
the sensing range rC ≥ 2 × rS , complete coverage of an area implies connectivity
among the nodes. Therefore, under this assumption, the connectivity problem
reduces to the coverage problem.
There is a trade-oﬀ between mimimal coverage and fault tolerance. For the
same set of sensors, a fault tolerant model will have a smaller area to cover. Or,
given an area to be covered, more sensors will be required, or the same number
of sensors but with a higher values for the parameters.
A model is k fault tolerant if by removal of any k nodes, the network preserves its functionality. A k fault tolerant model for the coverage problem will
be able to withstand k removals: by removing any k nodes, the covered region
remains the same. A 0 tolerant model will not work in case of any removal of a
node.
A straightforward approach is to either double the number of sensors in
each point, or to double the sensor parameters for some sensors of the minimal
coverage model to make it 1 tolerant. Similar actions can be taken for a 1 tolerant
model to be 2 tolerant and so on. In order for a k fault-tolerant model to be
worthwhile, it has to be better than the straightforward approach.
We propose three 1 fault tolerant models, and we compare them among each
other, and with the minimal coverage model in [8].

Fault Tolerant Models

For all models, we assume the sensing range to be r, and we compare them among
each other, and with the minimal coverage model [8]. In the ﬁrst model, the basic
structure is composed of four sensors arranged in a square-like structure of side
r. In the second model, the basic structure is composed of six sensors arranged in
a regular hexagon-like structure of side r. In the third model, the basic structure
is composed of seven sensors arranged in a regular hexagon-like structure of side
r, and the center of the hexagon as well. In these models the assumption that
the communication range is greater than twice the sensing range guarantees the
connectivity of the network.

Improved 7-Node Model

We now consider instead of the minimal coverage model of three nodes, the
seven-node model obtained by overlapping three three-node models (see Figure
3(a)), and we call it as the improved model.

(a) 7-node minimal coverage model

(b) Fault tolerant improved 7-node model

Fig. 3. 7-node models

The minimal coverage model can be made 1 fault tolerant by modifying the
sensing range
√ of some nodes: one of the three sensors increases its sensing range
from r to r 3. In this manner, when we overlap three such models we obtain
the improved 7-node model (see Figure 3(b)).

Comparative Results

We consider the following models: the minimum coverage model [8], the improved
model, the square model, and the hexagonal model. Let f. t. be a short form of
fault tolerant.
We compare the models in terms of number of active nodes at a time required
for covering a certain area, the covered area given a ﬁxed number of nodes,
and probability to function. Consider that all the sensors, independent of their
sensing range, have the probability p to fail, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, therefore the probability

Fault Tolerant Coverage Model for Sensor Networks

541

to function is 1 − p. Also we assume that any two failures are independent one
another.
In Table 1, we consider the following notations. Covered area denotes the
area covered by the polygonal line formed by the sensors. Fraction used denotes
the fraction of the sensor areas used for covering that area; this value aids in
calculating the energy used for covering the region. Eﬃciency is deﬁned as the
ratio between the previous two values (the covered area and the fraction of the
sensor area used), and denotes the eﬃciency of using a particular model. Max.
nodes to fail denotes the maximum number of nodes that can fail and still the
coverage is available over the number of nodes in the model. Prob. to function
denotes the probability for the model to be functional.
The values for the probability functions in case of the square and hexagonal
model from Table 1 follow. The probability to function in case of square model
is Psquare = (1 − p)4 + 4p(1 − p)3 + 2p2 (1 − p)2 = (1 − p)2 (1 + 2p − p2 ). In case
of the hexagonal model, the probability to function is Phexa = (1 − p)6 + 6p(1 −
p)5 + 15p2 (1 − p)4 + 2p3 (1 − p)3 = (1 − p)2 (1 + 3p + 6p2 − 8p3 ).

Conclusion

We study the coverage problem from the fault tolerance point of view for sensor
networks. Fault tolerance is a critical issue for sensors depending on where the

542

sensors are employed. The failure of one node should not incapacitate the entire
network. Wireless body sensors have to be energy eﬃcient, utilize bandwidth, robust, lightweight and fault tolerant as they are not easily replaceable, repairable
and rechargeable.
We propose three 1 fault tolerant models, and we compare them among themselves, and with the minimal coverage model. We are currently working on algorithms to move sensors in order to preserve the network functionality when
more than a fault occurs. If the network layout is composed by hundreds of such
proposed models, in some cases sensors need to be moved to cover areas left
uncovered by faulty or moving sensors.
