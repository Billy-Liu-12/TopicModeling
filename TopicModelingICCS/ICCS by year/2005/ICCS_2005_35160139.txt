Abstract. In the present paper it is developed mathematical model for description of heat and mass transfer processes and predicting velocity, temperature
and pollution concentrations near roadway. To describe convective transfer
controlled by the wind and gravity, we use Reynolds equations for turbulent
flow. The boundary value problem was solved numerically. A discrete analog
for equations was obtained by means of the control volume method. Methods of
predicting concentrations of automobile exhaust gases near roadways are
needed for the planning and design of roads and nearby structures.

1 Introduction
Mathematical model for description of heat and mass transfer processes and predicting velocity, temperature and pollution concentrations near roadway is constructed as
a result of an analysis of known experimental data and using concept and methods
from reactive media mechanics [1] and existing environmental pollution models [2,3].
It is considered that 1) the flow has a developed turbulent nature, molecular transfer
being neglected, 2) gaseous phase density doesn't depend on the pressure because of
the low velocities of the flow in comparison with the velocity of the sound, 3) the
traffic is uniformly distributed over all lanes, 4) two dimensional model used to predict the concentrations along a line normal to highway. The forest in forest belt represents a non-deformable porous-dispersed medium [4].

2 Problem Formulation
Let the coordinate reference point x1, x2 = 0 be situated at the center of the road surface source at the height of the roughness level, axis Ox2 directed upward, axis Ox1
directed parallel to the ground’s surface to the right in the direction (Fig. 1).
The problem formulated above is reduced to a solution of the Reynolds and transport equations for turbulent flow:

vi, (i = 1, 2) are the Cartesian coordinates and the velocity components; ρ, T - density
and temperature of air, P - pressure; cP – constant pressure specific heat of the gas, cα mass concentrations (α=1 – CO, 2 –CHx, 3 – NOx, 4 – soot, 5 – inert components of
air); Ve – wind speed at the height 1,5 m, Mα - molecular mass of α -components of
the gas phase; V20 - velocity of automobile exhaust gases, γe – gradient of stratification of temperature, cd is an empirical coefficient of the resistance of the vegetation, s
is the specific surface of the forest elements; index e corresponds to the unperturbed
parameters of the medium. The components of the tensor of turbulent stresses and the
turbulent fluxes of heat and mass are written in terms of the gradients of the average
flow [4]. The road is modeled as a plane source of burning motorway fuels with
known temperature and concentrations of automobile exhaust gases.

3 Numerical Simulation and Results
The boundary value problem (1) – (10) was solved numerically. A discrete analog for
equations was obtained by means of the control volume method using the SIMPLE
algorithm [5]. The accuracy of the program was checked by the method of inserted
analytical solutions. Analytical expressions for the unknown functions were substituted in (1)–(10) and the closure of the equations were calculated. Next, the values of
the functions were inferred with an accuracy of not less than 1%. Our practical situation requires calculation domain with obstacles in the middle of the flow region. It is
convenient to employ a Cartesian coordinates but to modify the difference equations
using method of fiction domain [5]. In the present calculations the results are obtained
by using data: T=300K, Ve =2 m/sec, the width of highway is 12 m, the number of
cars passing per unit time (hour) is 3000, percentage structure of traffic (cars - 56%,
lorries and buses – 19%, automobiles with diesel engine – 25%). The distribution of

temperature of air, velocity, concentrations of components were obtained at different
instants of time. The fields of mass concentrations of automobile emissions CO and
vectorial fields of velocity (Fig. 2) were presented at the moment t=6 min when the
steady situation is realized. The wind field under the street canyon interacts with the
gas-jet obstacle that forms from the surface source of heated air masses of automobile
emissions. Recirculating flow forms beyond the zone of heat and mass release, i.e.
street canyon. We can note that the distribution of velocity and concentration are
deformed in the domain by the action of wind, which interacts with the buildings.
Similarly, the others fields of component concentrations of pollutants are deformed. It
allows investigating dynamics of environmental pollution under influence of various
conditions: meteorology conditions and parameters of traffic flow (the number of cars
of different types, traffic density and etc.). By increasing the wind velocity, the results
show that the concentration of CO is drop around the street canyon more intensive.

Conclusions

The obtained results are agreed with the laws of physics and experimental data obtained near highway Moscow-Petersburg (Russia). Mathematical model and the results of the calculation give an opportunity to evaluate critical levels of environmental
pollution and the damage from motorcar.
