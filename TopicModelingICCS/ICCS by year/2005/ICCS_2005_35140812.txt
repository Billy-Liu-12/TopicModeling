Abstract. The disadvantage of multi-dimension assignment algorithm of data
association in distributed passive-sensor system is the lower processing speed.
The modified optimal assignment algorithm is presented in this paper. The new
algorithm avoids a large quantity of calculation of cost function of 4-tuple
measurements and removes the disturbance of some false location points.
Simulation results show that by using the algorithm discussed in this paper, not
only the calculation burden is reduced greatly but also the accuracy of data
association is improved correspondingly.

1 Introduction
Because passive-sensor doesn’t radiate any electromagnetism signal, and has the
advantage of both better concealment and less interference of the enemy, passivesensor location has become a hot research point which is studied by many scholars.
When the target’s position is estimated by bearing-only measurements from passive
sensors, the better method of data association is to transform the problem to the
optimal assignment problem of operational research [1], [2]. The disadvantage of the
optimal assignment algorithm of multi-passive-sensor multi-target data association is
the long processing time caused by the heavier calculation burden of cost function
[3]. In the case of the four bearing-only sensors and multi-target are in the same plane,
this paper proposes a modified algorithm based on direction-finding cross location.
The essence of the modified algorithm is a two-stage association algorithm. In the
first stage, we eliminate some false intersection points by using a cross location
technology, and in the second stage, only those points which have passed through the
gating of the correlation test in the first stage can be permitted to join the assignment
process. This reduces the computation burden from the calculation of cost function for
assignment problem. In the meantime, with the removing of the large number of false
location points, the effect of data association is improved.

2 Data Association
2.1 The Traditional Optimal Algorithm
Supposed four bearing-only sensors are used to locate targets as illustrated in Fig.1.
The positions of four sensors are p s = ( x s , y s ) T ,

s = 1,2,3,4; suppose there are N

targets in Surveillance view, and the position of target t is pt = ( xt , y t ) T ; Suppose
the number of measurements of sensor s is n s , s =1,2,3,4; the bearing-only sensor
only measures the azimuth of target t , and it is denoted as Z sis , i s = 1,2...n s ; if the
measurement is from a real target, it is the true observable θ st plus the Gaussian
noise N (0, σ s2 ) , and if it is from spurious measurement, suppose it follows the
uniform distribution in the field of view of sensor s.

Where Pds is the detect probability of sensor s , u (i s ) is a binary indicator function, if

u (i s ) = 1. p( Z sis ωt ) is the probability density function of Z sis being from target t,

where Ψ s is the field of view of sensor s, the cost of associating the 4-tuple to target t
is given by

ci1i2i3i4 = − ln
Λ ( Z i1i2i3i4 t = Φ)
As ωt in (1) is unknown, it can usually be replaced by its maximum likelihood or

The solution of 4-D assignment problem can be shown to be NP-hard [2], [5]. The
optimal technique requires unacceptable time and is of little practical value. Instead,
fast and near the optimal solutions are most desirable. Among various heuristic

Application of Four-Dimension Assignment Algorithm

algorithms of multi-dimension assignment problem, Lagrangian relaxation algorithm
has a dominant role owing to its satisfying result in application. It relaxes the 4-D
assignment problem to a series of 2-D assignment problem to solve, which can be
resolved by various algorithms in polynomial time [4]. The advantage of this
algorithm compared with the other modern optimal algorithm is that not only can we
obtain a suboptimal solution which is near to the optimal solution, but also can obtain
a measure of the quality of this solution. When the density of targets and false alarms
in surveillance is higher, the run time of Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is still too
long to satisfy the need of engineering because of the large quantity of calculation
burden from association cost, so we present a modified algorithm in next section.
2.2 The Modified Algorithm

The description of the cross location for four bearing-only sensors are shown in Fig.2.
θ i (i=1,2,3,4) denote the bearing measurements, The positions of four sensors are
denoted by (xi, yi), i=1,2,3,4, and the Cartesian position of A, B,C is denoted by (xA,
yA), (xB, yB), (xC, yC) . Then from the formula

and

we can get the Cartesian position of B, C and the distance function d BC and d AC in
the same way.
Let
(12)
d = d AB + d BC + d AC
In actuality, the Cartesian position of A, B and C usually don’t coincide because of
the sensor’s measurement error. In consideration of the special position of sensor 2,
the probability that the four measurements come from a same target can be estimated
by the value of d. In general, the smaller the value is, the more possible that they
come from a same target has. We can use the value of d to be the statistics to
determine if we should calculate the association cost of 4-tuple of measurements. This
can avoid the large operation quantity from statistic test aiming to each 4-tuple of
measurements one by one. The disadvantages using distance function to construct test
statistics of χ2 distribution to carry on the data correlation test, one is the heavy
burden of calculation, the other is inferior data association result caused by the reason
that the statistic may be not obey to the χ2 distribution strictly sometimes. According
to the large number of numeral simulations with the various measurement errors, the
gating of statistics d can be determined by τ = 500 × 180 × σ / π , where σ denotes the
bearing measurement error of each sensor, if it is different from various sensors, σ
can be replaced by the average of four error values.
As the association cost of 4-D assignment problem is defined as formula (3), so the
corresponding 4-tuple of measurements Z i1i2i3i4 may be considered a candidate
association if and only if ci1i2i3i4 < 0 , and all the 4-tuple of measurements
Z i1i2i3i4 with ci1i2i3i4 > 0 can be eliminated from the list of candidate associations by a

certain measure. The sparsity of candidate association is defined as the ratio of the
number of potential measurement-target association in the 4-D assignment problem to
the number of a fully connection. In the former algorithm, sparsity s0 is defined as the
ratio of the number of association with negative cost value of the 4-tuple of
measurements to the total association number. In the modified method, sparsity sτ is
defined as the ratio of the number of association having passed the gating of the rough
correlation test to the number of the fully association. In order to remove some false
location points whose association cost are smaller relatively, sτ is adopted as lower
than s0 or nearer to it. This can decrease the system error of the model of assignment
problem. Therefore, the accuracy of data association of multi-sensor multi-target can
be improved correspondingly.

The experimental function τ which is given above is just be taken as a approximate
superior gating, we can also adjust the size of the gating by observing the number of
cost function in the pages of two-dimension at different circumstance timely. In fact,
sparsity of candidate target in 4-D assignment problem is usually lower. According to
the current accuracy of direction-finding cross location technique, the ratio of the
number of cost function need to be calculated to the total number of cost function is
about 10-15% in the two-dimension pages of association cost.
From above analysis, the modified algorithm can be regarded as a two-stage
correlation process constituted by both rough correlation process based on verdict
function and the accurate correlation process based on the optimal assignment.

3 Performance of Simulation
3.1 Simulation Model

Suppose the sensors’ position are shown in Fig.1, the position of four sensors are (2000, 0), (-1000, -1000 3 ), (1000, -1000 3 ) and (2000, 0). The bearing
measurement error of various sensor is the same value, we use them, σ θ of 0.40, 0.80.
The detection probability of each sensor is assumed to be 1, and the false alarm rate is
assumed 1/rad.
3.2 Analysis of Simulation Results

As shown in table 1, in the modified algorithm, either the sparsity sτ is adopted as
sτ ≈ s0 or adopted as sτ < s0 , both the run times reduced largely compared with the
former algorithm. This is because that a large quantity of calculation from the false
location points is cut. The difference between the two case is that the procedure time
of sτ < s0 is little lower than the result of the case of sτ ≈ s0 . In addition, an obvious
result is that the association accuracy correlated to sτ < s0 is advantage of the result
of sτ ≈ s0 . This result mainly because that with the appropriate limitation of the
gating of verdict function in the case of sτ < s0 , some false location points with lower
cost value are removed from the candidate association, and this causes the accuracy of
data association and location to be improved by 7~8 percents.
As the measurement error is supposed 0.020, the relations between the proceeding
time of 4-D assignment algorithm and the number of targets are given in Fig.3. It is
obvious that the run time growths rapidly with the increase of the number of targets
when the former algorithm is adopted, but it increases slowly when the modified
algorithm ( sτ < s0 ) is used. This result shows that the more the number of targets is,
the more obvious the advantage of the modified algorithm demonstrates. In other
words, the new algorithm is more applicable to solve the data association problem in
high density environment of targets and false alarms.

4 Conclusions
This text mainly studies data association algorithm in multi-sensor multi-target
location system. A modified algorithm based on Lagarangian relaxation algorithm
of 4-D assignment problem is presented. The gating of the verdict function in the
first stage correlation process is discussed and given. The new algorithm reduces
the run time of the global optimal algorithm of 4-D assignment problem, and
improves the effect of data association and location. This idea can be developed to
the situation that the sensors and targets are not in the same plane, and it has widely
application in other fields of the social activities.
