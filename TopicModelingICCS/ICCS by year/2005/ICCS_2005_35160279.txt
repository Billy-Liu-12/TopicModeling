Abstract. To quantify the goodness of a conﬁguration, we develop a
probabilistic model of network conﬁguration. A probabilistic graph then
represents the statistical dependence in network conﬁguration, and shows
that self-conﬁguration can be optimized if the graph has nested local
dependence.

Introduction

Self-conﬁguration is for the network to achieve a desired network conﬁguration
by end-users in a distributed fashion, where each node adjusts its local conﬁguration by following a local algorithm based on information from neighbors. A
key requirement is that the local algorithm is optimal so that the desired global
conﬁguration can be achieved. The desired “globally optimal conﬁguration” is
considered to the one that makes trade-oﬀ between spatial channel-reuse maximization and constraint on both topology and reconﬁguration cost. We consider
topology formation and re-covery from failures. As many algorithms and protocols have provided promising results for self-conﬁguration, it is not clear when
self-conﬁguration is implementable in a fully distributed fashion. This work intends to address the following questions: (a) How to quantify the goodness (i.e.,
optimality) of a network conﬁguration? (b) When and how can local adaptation
of nodes result in a globally optimal conﬁguration?

Problem Formulation

Consider an ad-hoc wireless network with N nodes, with positions, X =
{X1 , · · · , XN }. Let σij be random activity of link (i, j), referred to as a “commu-

nication dipole,” σij = 1 if node i is transmitting to node j; and σij = −1, otherwise. A network conﬁguration is a combination of both the topology and link
activities, G=(σ, X); and an optimal conﬁguration includes an optimal physical
topology (X) with maximal channel reuse (σ) under management constraints.
The management constraints considered in this work are for (a) link quality (e.g.
on signal to interference + noise (SINR)), (b) maximized geographical coverage
of nodes while maintaining 1-connectivity, and (c) minimized cost in re-adjusting
positions for failure recovery. The optimal conﬁguration (σ ∗ , X ∗ ) is deﬁned as

the most likely conﬁguration that maximizes the likelihood function, arg max(σ,X)
P (σ, X|σ0 , X0 ), where (σ0 , X0 ) is the initial conﬁguration.
Self-organization is to obtain optimal distributed algorithms characterized
by local rules, gi ( ), for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , so that node positions can be adapted by
end-users,

Cross-Layer Model of Network Conﬁguration

To quantify the goodness of a network conﬁguration, we obtain the likelihood
P (σ, X| σ0 , X0 ) which is from P (σ|X, σ0 , X0 ) and P (X|σ0 , X0 ).

Link Activities

Assuming the traﬃc demand is all-to-all for simplicity, the management constraint for σ is then to maximize the spatial channel reuse. Thus, P (σ|X, σ0 , X0 )
= P (σ|X). Each feasible communication conﬁguration of a network can be represented with the total energy of the network, which is referred to as “conﬁguration
Hamiltonian.”
• Conﬁguration Hamiltonian : The conﬁguration Hamiltonian of a network
is then characterized by the total negative power − ij Pj and denoted as

where ηij = (σij + 1)/2, NijM is the neighboring dipoles within
MAC range of an active dipole σij ; and the dipoles outside the MAC range,
denoted as NijI , are allowed to be active concurrently, resulting in interference.
Relevant interference neighbors are those whose power exceeds a threshold, i.e.,
−4
Pth ≤ Pm ·lmj
. The minimum region that covers all relevant interference neighbors
is referred to as the “interference range.”
The interference outside the inference range is denoted with a remainder
RIij (σ, X). With RI (σ, X) =
RIij (σ, X), being the total contribution due to

interference outside the interference range.
• Boltzmann Distribution : The total energy U (σ|X) can now be related to
probability P (σ|X) using an analogy between communication activities in ad-hoc
wireless networks and particles in statistical physics [2]. The probability distribution of particle systems obeys the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution [2]. As a
result, for a conﬁguration Hamiltonian, the corresponding Boltzmann distribution is P (σ|X) = exp −U T(σ|X) / σ exp −U T(σ|X) .

Random Position of Nodes

We now obtain the probability distribution of node positions P(X|σ0 , X0 ), assuming that current node positions are conditionally independent of initial conditions, i.e., P (X|σ0 , X0 ) = P (X|X0 ).
With no management purposes, nodes’ movement can be characterized by a
two-dimensional random-walk around ﬁxed positions, where P (X|X0 ) is a multivariate Gaussian distribution with an exponent U (X|X0 ) = (X − X0 )T · (X − X0 )/
2σ 2 , and variance of node movement σ 2 . The Hamiltonian U (X|X0 ) shows that
aimless motions are penalized.
Management constraints make nodes move cooperatively to achieve a
pre-deﬁned constraint, e.g., 1-connected topology. The 1-connectivity can be
achieved by a Yao-like graph [3], which can be implemented with
C(Xi , Xj ) =

|lij − lth | , otherwise

where 0 is a small constant, lth is a threshold, lij is the distance between nodes
i and j.
The extended Hamiltonian for the topology is U (X|X0 ) = U (X|X0 ) +
ζ · C(Xi , Xj ) , where U (X|X0 ) is due to free movements, ζ is a weighting
i
j∈Ni
constant, and Ni is the set of the nearest neighboring nodes of node i for every
angle θ (θ=90o in this work).
For faults recovery, the propagation of conﬁguration changes may need to be
minimized across the entire network, and thus an additional penalty function can
be introduced as the cost of reconﬁguration, e.g., fP1 (σ, X) = (σ, X) −(σ0 , X0 ) ,
where
denotes a vector norm. The resulting topology constraint is then
C (Xi , Xj ) = C(Xi , Xj ) + C1 · fP1 (σ, X), where C1 is constant, weighting the tradeoﬀ between global optimization and local recovery.

Graphical Representation of Network Conﬁguration

To determine the optimality of distributed self-conﬁguration, it suﬃces to examine with graphical models [1] whether the obtained likelihood function is
factorizable. A set of random variables, e.g., X, is called a Gibbs Random Field
−U (X)
[1]. Hammersley-Cliﬀord
(GRF) if it obeys Gibbs distribution, Z0−1 exp T
Theorem [1] shows that a GRF is is equivalent with an MRF, which shows the
spatial Markov dependence among nodes.
Since the Boltzmann distribution of a network conﬁguration obeys a Gibbs
form, a network conﬁguration can be modeled with an MRF. First, consider the
random link activities given node positions. Since link activities for dipoles are
all dependent, the graph is fully connected. However, RI (σ, X) and R3 (σ, X)
are negligible in Hamiltonian. The remaining two terms deﬁne an approximation P l (σ|X), to the original Boltzmann distribution, where P l (σ|X) = Z10 ·

MRF, (σ|X), is now the well-known second-order Ising model [1].

Next, for the 1-connectivity topology, U (X|X0 ) shows that the random ﬁeld,
(X|X0 ), is a Potts model with random bonds [1] with the ﬁrst-order neighbors.
As a result, the coupled MRF (σ, X| σ0 , X0 ) can be fully described by an Ising
model and a Potts model together, representing the nested local dependence
with random bonds. Especially, for the special case of free node-movement, the
coupled random ﬁeld becomes a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) [1].

Self-conﬁguration: Distributed Algorithm and
Failure-Recovery

The nearly optimal conﬁguration is the one that maximizes the approximated
likelihood function. Maximizing the global likelihood function reduces to maximizing local likelihood at cliques, i.e., for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N , (Xˆi (t + 1), σˆij (t + 1)) =
arg max(Xi (t+1),σij (t+1)) P l (Xi (t + 1), σij (t + 1) |XNi (t), σNi (t)). Therefore, the nearly
optimal local rule gi () = P l (). Stochastic relaxation is an optimal distributed
algorithm through Gibbs sampling [1]. Now self conﬁguration is viewed as local
optimizations of Hamiltonian on cliques.
An important application of self-conﬁguration is adaptive recovery from failures. Consider node failures from an optimal conﬁguration. There is a tradeoﬀ between global optimization of network conﬁguration and failure localization. Figure 1 (a) shows the self-conﬁgured topology, where the failed nodes are

marked by stars. Due to failure localization, Figure 1 (b) shows that only nodes
within the arc are involved in the recovery.

Conclusion

We ﬁnd that a random-bond model is the probability distribution of the network
conﬁguration where link activities are coupled by random coeﬃcients due to
node positions. Probability graphs show the conditions on when distributed selfconﬁguration is optimal: (a) interference from far away nodes is negligible, and
(b) management constraints are local on both connectivity and reconﬁguration
cost.
