Abstract. Loop integrals occur in higher order perturbation calculations for the cross section of particle interactions in high energy physics.
In previous work we introduced a numerical extrapolation method to
handle a class of Feynman loop diagrams where the integrand shows a
singular behavior on a hypersurface which may intersect the domain of
integration. The integral is considered in the limit as a parameter in the
integrand tends to zero. Under certain conditions, the extrapolation process achieves convergence acceleration to the limit. In order to handle
massless cases, we apply a dimensional regularization technique to extract infrared divergences from the integral. We illustrate the combined
technique using a scalar one-loop sample integral.

Introduction

Loop integrals occur in higher order perturbation terms of the scattering amplitude, which is used for cross section computations of particle interactions in high
energy physics. The cross section of a particle interaction gives the probability
of a given conﬁguration in energy-momentum space (E, p1 , p2 , p3 ).
Figure 1 gives an example of a one-loop Feynman diagram [2]. In a Feynman diagram, each line, termed propagator is associated with a particle and can
be straight or wavy depending on whether the particle is a fermion or boson,
respectively. M and m are particle masses. A propagator corresponds to an intermediate state of a particle, where it is not observable. Particles collide at the
vertices of the diagram, according to a coupling constant g which represents the
strength of the interaction.
The diagram of Figure 1 is a one-loop diagram as it exhibits a single loop.
No-loop (tree diagram) and multi-loop conﬁgurations are possible. The number
of vertices N speciﬁes the type of the diagram (e.g., vertex for N = 3 and box
for N = 4).
The scattering amplitude T is expanded as a (perturbation) series in g,
T = T0 + T1 g + T2 g 2 + . . . .

Here, T0 represents the tree amplitude, and Tk the k-loop amplitude for k ≥ 1.
The cross section is then derived as a series from (1) (see [8]).
A general form of the scalar one-loop N -point integral is given in [3], as a
4-dimensional integral over the loop momenta. In [8], a sample one-loop integral
with three propagators is introduced as

where l is the loop momentum, and p and q are given momenta which are assumed to satisfy p2 = q 2 = m2 . Furthermore, ε > 0 is a real constant which is
supplied to prevent the integral from diverging. The physical scattering amplitude contains this type of integrals and its value is deﬁned at ε = 0. Using the

Regularization and Extrapolation Methods

167

While analytical formulations were given for scalar one-loop integrals, e.g.,
in [9, 10], there is considerable interest in numerical methods which could handle
non-scalar cases in a similar way.
In [2] we introduced a numerical extrapolation method to handle Feynman
loop diagrams where the integrand shows a singular behavior on a hypersurface
which may intersect the domain of integration. The scalar 1-loop vertex integral
was considered as a study case.
The extrapolation procedure yields an approximation to the limit as ε tends
to 0, under certain conditions on the asymptotic behavior of the integral with
respect to ε. The infrared singularity, where M/m → 0, aﬀects the asymptotic
behavior. The eﬀect of the singularity (at x1 = x2 = 0) emerges in the integral (2)
above as M is set to 0 in (3).
In this paper we investigate a combination of the extrapolation for ε → 0 with
the dimensional regularization method by Binoth and Heinrich [1]. The latter
extracts poles introduced by the infrared singularity (but does not handle the
internal singularity). Dimensional regularization is applied in QCD (Quantum
Chromodynamics) which deals with the strong interactions between quarks and
gluons (both are massless).

Regularization Techniques

One method to regulate the infrared divergence is by using the ﬁctitious mass
λ of the photon as M = λ. This results in a singular behavior of the form log λ
when (2) is integrated analytically.
Another method uses dimensional regularization. For the latter, we re-write
the exponent of the denominator in (4) as N −D/2 with the dimension D = 4−2η
as η → 0. As shown in [1], this results in a Laurent expansion of the integral as
a function of η, from which the poles can be extracted.
Both methods introduce non-physical situations: the mass of the photon does
not correspond to nature, and the extra dimension from 4 is also non-physical.
This implies that the ﬁnal results should not depend on the ﬁctitious photon
mass, or on 1/η. The Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem [4, 5, 6] implies that,
after accumulating the amplitude with respect to one-loop diagrams and emission
of the photon, the infrared divergence disappears, i.e., the terms involving the
photon mass vanish; or the coeﬃcient of the 1/η term resulting in the dimensional
regularization is zero.
The (linear) extrapolation procedure of [2] gives good extrapolated results
for m = me = 0.511 10−3 GeV, M = 10−5 GeV and s = 100 GeV2 , using
small ε values in the integrand. As an example, the approximated imaginary
part gives 0.86805413, in agreement with the analytical expression given in [3],
for ε = 2−32 (∗2−1 ) 2−41 and double precision arithmetic. This run takes time
of the order of 20-25 seconds on a 2.5 GHz Athlon processor laptop.
The convergence behavior is illustrated for the real part in Table 1. For
the ε values listed in the leftmost column, the numerical integration results
for (2) (disregarding the constant factor −1/(16π 2 )) are listed in column 2,

and the corresponding extrapolated results using linear extrapolation in column
3. The integration was performed iteratively using a one-dimensional code in
each direction (dqage from Quadpack [7]), with a relative error tolerance of
10−12 .
For M = 10−5 or 10−7 GeV and s = 100, 10, 000 or 100, 000 GeV2 , results
can be obtained to 5 or 6 ﬁgure accuracy (starting from, e.g., ε = 2−42 , and for
a requested integration accuracy of 10−7 or 10−8 for the integral approximations
corresponding to each of the ε values).
It is interesting to note that, even though the procedure breaks down for
M = 10−9 GeV using double precision arithmetic, we are able to extend it
to M = 10−15 GeV using quadruple precision and a total number of function
evaluations of the order of 107 for a requested relative accuracy of 10−7 . The
method works in cases where the integrals can be obtained eﬃciently for very
small ε values.

Dimensional Regularization

In this section we apply a dimensional regularization technique. According to [1]
we split the integral (2) into sector integrals. We will omit the term −iε in the
notation below initially; it is re-introduced later for the computation.
We start from the form

of dimension N = 3 and where D = 4 − 2η. As we are interested in the infrared
singularity, we will consider the case where M → 0 (and m is ﬁxed).

The domain is split into N sectors, which in this case are given by:
{ (x1 , x2 , x3 ) | 0 ≤ x2 ≤ x1 , 0 ≤ x3 ≤ x1 },
{ (x1 , x2 , x3 ) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 , 0 ≤ x3 ≤ x2 },
{ (x1 , x2 , x3 ) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x3 , 0 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 }.
The integral I1 over the ﬁrst sector is thus as I but where the integration limits
of the x2 and x3 ranges are replaced by (0, x1 ). Performing the transformation
x1
x2 = x1 t1
x3 = x1 t2
in (5) yields

The extrapolation procedure of [2] applied to the sum of I1 , I2 and I3 gives the
same results as when applied to I, for example, with m = 40 GeV, M = 93 GeV,
s = 9000 GeV2 and ε (for the extrapolation) ranging over 128 (∗2−1 ) 1.

Infrared Singularity

Examination of the sector integrals obtained previously as M → 0 indicates that
only I3 in (7) shows the infrared singularity; indeed its denominator
(−t1 t2 s + (t1 + t2 )2 m2 )N −D/2 → 0
as both t1 and t2 tend to zero, and N − D/2 = N − 2 + η = 1 + η → 1 as η → 0.

where the exponent of t2 is D + 1 − 2N = −1 − 2η, which tends to −1 as η → 0.
This corresponds to a logarithmic behavior caused by the infrared singularity.
With respect to the singularity at t2 = 0, we expand the part
f (t2 , η) = (1 + t2 t1 + t2 )2N −D−3
around t2 = 0. Since we set D = 4 − 2η, the exponent of the singular factor in
t2 is D + 1 − 2N = 4 − 2η + 1 − 6 = −1 − 2η. Thus we expand
f (t2 , η) = f (0) (0, η) + R(t2 , η),
with the remainder term
R(t2 , η) = f (t2 , η) − f (0) (0, η) = f (t2 , η) − 1.
Substituting for f (t2 , η) in I3 gives

Thus, with respect to the infrared singularity, the integral is split into two terms,
the ﬁrst one of which accounts for the pole as η → 0. The ﬁnite part of I3 is
derived from the term in R(t2 , η),

Numerical results can be obtained converging to the ﬁnite part by setting η = 0
and introducing (extrapolating on) the ε parameter to account for the singularity
inside the integration region.

Conclusions

The dimensional regularization technique of Binoth and Heinrich [1] leads to
obtaining a Laurent series expansion as a function of η. Their method does not
deal with integrand singularities inside the region of integration. To handle a
singularity on a quadratic which intersects the integration region, we introduce
a parameter ε in the integrand and perform an extrapolation as ε tends to 0.
This technique enables us to evaluate the ﬁnite part integral.
Furthermore we consider a regularization with respect to the photon mass
parameter, results of which depend on the arithmetic precision used for the
computation.
