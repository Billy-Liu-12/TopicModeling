Abstract. We consider a broad class of stochastic models of a ﬁnancial
market generalizing the classical Black–Scholes model, which comprise
both: stochastic volatility of Brownian type and jumps at random times.
We restrict ourselves to the model, where volatility is described by the
diﬀusion which comprises the Heston stochastic volatility deﬁned as a
diﬀusion of Brownian type and the Poisson jump diﬀusion. We provide
an argument that such models perfectly match typical real–life ﬁnancial
phenomena comparing the so-called logarithmic returns.
Applying computer simulations methods we investigate the dependence of prices of a few selected contingent claims (specifying some different options) on the parameters of our stochastic model.

The Market Model

Consider a ﬁnancial market where two assets S0 and S are traded up to a ﬁxed
horizon T .
Let (Ω, F, P ) be a probability space and let {F(t)}0≤t≤T be a P-augmented
right-continuous ﬁltration.
The riskless asset price is given by
S0 (t) = exp(rt), ∀t ∈ [0, T ],

(1)

where r is non-negative deterministic risk free interest rate. The dynamics of
risky asset’s price is given by
dS(t) = S(t− ){µdt + σ(V (t))[

1 − ρ2 dW (t) + ρdW σ (t)]

+ α1 dN λ1 (t) + α2 dN λ2 (t)},
dV (t) = ηdt + γdW σ (t),

(2)

where (W, W σ ) is two dimensional Brownian motion, N λi are independent
compensated Poisson process (ie. N λi (t) = N λi (t) − λi t), {V (t)}0≤t≤T is the

volatility process, ρ is the correlation between asset process and its volatility,
ρ ∈ [−1, 1], µ, η, γ are constants, σ is a function that satisﬁes
∃σ, σ > 0 ∀z ∈ IR σ ≤ σ(z) ≤ σ.

We take two independent Poisson processes to assure that both jumps up and
down would be available. To achieve that it is necessary to choose parameters
|α1 | < 1 and |α2 | < 1 of the diﬀerent signs. To explain this model we suggest

Fig. 1. Asset’s price returns for various market model. On picture (a) there are real
logarithmic returns of prices of IBM’s stocks. Remaining pictures show logarithmic returns of prices modelled in various way: (b) simple diﬀusion (like Black-Scholes model),
(c) stochastic volatility (like Heston model), (d) stochastic volatility and Poisson jumps

to compare the examples obtained at Fig.1. Looking at (b) and (c) we see that
stochastic volatility improves the model and makes it more accurate but only
(d) reﬂects all phenomenon which are characteristic to prices behavior. It is well
known that absence of arbitrage which is equivalent to existence of martingale
measure, is absolutely necessary to compute the fair price of any option. In this
new measure the process of discounted price of risky asset should be a martingale.
On the market deﬁned above the Radon-Nikodym’s derivative can be deﬁned as

The processes θ and ν are interpreted as the risk premiums connected with the
Brownian motions W and W σ respectively. The premium for the risk related to
Poisson processes Niλ are φi .
Having only one such equation we are not able to ﬁnd the new measure
uniquely. After Merton we can assume that the premiums coming from the Poisson processes disappear. But even than we can write the process θ only dependent
on process ν.
According to Girsanov’s theorem we obtain W0 (t) and W0σ (t) as new Wienner
processes and N Li (t) as a new compensated Poisson processes (with intensity
Li ). Since only one risky asset is traded, the premiums are not unique and nor
is the martingale measure.
Applying new processes to the discounted asset price we obtain

It is easy to see that the above process is a supermaringale and since σ satisﬁes
the (3) condition it is also a martingale.

Option Prices

It is well known that the option price with payout function ψ(S(T )) is ruled by
the equation
ECC(t) = S0 (t)EQ

ψ(S(T ))|F(t) =
EP [H(T )ψ(S(T ))|F(t)] ,
S0 (T )
H(T )

is a state density price.
where H(t) = SZ(t)
0 (t)
Now substituting S0 (t) according to (2), and knowing that H(0) = 0 we
obtain the option premium with payout function ψ(S(T )).
ECC(0) = e−rT E [Z(T )ψ(S(T ))] .

Having the solution in the form of expectation like in (6), the easiest way to
obtain results is using the Monte Carlo method.
In all examples containing stochastic volatility we assume that the function
σ has the form σ(z) = z, σ ≤ z ≤ σ, And σ have the values σ, σ, respectively
outside the above interval.

In all simulations the models are parameterized in the same way. First case
is standard European option and parameters are chosen so to obtain similar
premium. We assume exercise price K = S(0) = 100$. Second line is binary
option, which guarantee to pay amount X = 50$ if the price of asset in the
maturity time will be greater than K = 130$. Third case is an lookback option
(option depend on all trajectory, not only last moment). It pays the diﬀerence
between price of stock at maturity time and minimal price of asset on all time
horizon. Forth case is so-called quantile option (qα (·) is a quantile of range α)
and the last is Asian option where M (T0 , T, S) is the mean price on time horizon
(T0 , T ), T0 > t0 = 0.
