Abstract. The problem of optimization embedded in simulation on
models type System Dynamics is rather new for ﬁeld modelers. In model
DYNBALANCE(2-2-c) authors link the algorithm of solving the pseudosolution of overdetermined system of equations to classical structure of
type System Dynamics – to minimize the speciﬁc Euclidean norm which
measures some aspect of the dynamical behaviour of system.

Introduction

The classical concept of system Dynamics [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11] assumes, that, during
the time horizon of the simulation, the structure (given a-priori) will remain
constant. Last couple of years, some ideas of structural evolution has occurred
in System Dynamics modelling. First prof. Coyle [1] took the problem of, so
called ”simulation during optimization”. The question was: how to ”optimize”
the structure in order to achieve the desired behaviour? Kasperska and Slota
have gone the opposite way. The idea was: how to embedding the optimization
in simulation on System Dynamics models? In work [7], the attention has been
focused on two methods of embedding the optimization in simulation. One of
them took advantage from linear programming. However the second considered
the idea of Legras (for pseudosolution of overdetermined system). Such ”hybrid”
ideas has enriched the possibilities of classical System Dynamics, specially in
context of measuring the interesting aspect of dynamical behaviour of system.
Now authors present extended version of model DYNBALANCE(2-2) (named:
DYNBALANCE(2-2-c)) and some results of experiments undertaken by applying
language Professional Dynamo 4.0.

The idea of solving the matrix equation (1) uses the method of Legras [9] by
ﬁnding the so called ”pseudosolution”, which minimize the norm of overdetermined equation (1). This is the Euclidean norm, so it is the square root of sum

of squares of discrepancies (Ax − b)i , for i = 1, 2, . . . , 10. So, the found solution
is that give the best ”ﬁtting” of balance (modelling by equation (1)).
Technically speaking, the solving of matrix equation (1) is the problem of
programming speciﬁc works on matrixes, in order to attain x:

–

prices: price1 = 300, price2 = 350;
sources of raw materials: sourc1 = 20, sourc2 = 20;
initial levels of inventory of product P 1 and P 2: lin1 = 350, lin2 = 350;
initial levels of raw materials during transformation into product P 1 and
P 2: lmt1 = 200, lmt2 = 400;
– parameters of technology: q11 = 1, q12 = 2, q21 = 1, q22 = 2.
The possibilities of experimentations on model DYNBALANCE(2-2-c) are
practically unlimited. For example: the prices can become random as sources of
raw materials too. Below, in the next section, the chosen results of experiments 1–
5 will be presented.

The Results of Experiments

On Figures 2–6 the main characteristic of some variables from the model
DYNBALANCE(2-2-c) are presented. The Reader, who will be interested in
details, has possibilities to compare such important (in sense of ”quality” of ﬁtting the balance: A x = b, and in sense of dynamics of whole system) variables,
like: norm, lin1, lin2, prof 1, prof 2 and the others.

Under the diﬀerent condition about the demands for product P 1 and P 2
system reacts in such a way that minimize the Euclidean norm. So, the rates of
raw materials: rm11, rm12 and rm22, are optimal to ﬁt the balance A x = b
(see Figure 1) and the ”quality” of ﬁtting, variable norm has optimal value
in each step of simulation (in whole horizon two years). So, the embedding
optimization in simulation, has dynamical character and is ”compatible” with
idea of dynamical modelling in Forrester’s way. Precisely speaking, it’s some
extension of System Dynamics method possibilities.

Final Remarks and Conclusions

The purpose of the paper was to present some results of experiments undertaken
on model DYNBALANCE(2-2-c). Such experiments consider the problem of
optimization embedded in simulation. The authors have linked the algorithm

842

of solving the pseudosolution of overdetermined system of equation to classical
structure of type System Dynamics. Final conclusions are as follows:
– simulation on models type System Dynamics, linked with optimization technique, is a good tool for analysing the dynamical, complex, nonlinear, multilevel system;
– the locally optimal decisions can be confront with dynamic of a system like
a whole – its give the supportive tool for decision-makers and for the projectors of the information- decision systems as well;
– if seems that such ”hybrid” ideas, like presented in paper, has a future –
that enrich the possibilities of famous Forrester’s method and makes them
adequate to diﬀerent situations in real systems.
