Abstract. In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees of a given set of prokaryote organisms by randomly sampling relatively small oligopeptides of a ﬁxed length from their complete
proteomes. For each of the organisms, a vector of frequencies of those
sampled oligopeptides is generated and used as a building block in reconstructing phylogenetic trees. By this procedure, phylogenetic trees
are generated independently, and a consensus tree of the resulting trees
is obtained. We have applied our method to a set of 109 organisms, including 16 Archaea, 87 Bacteria, and 6 Eukarya, using less 10 % of all the
3,200,000 oligopeptides of length 5. Our consensus tree agrees with the
tree of Bergey’s Manual in most of the basic taxa. In addition, they have
almost the same quality as the trees of the same organisms reconstructed
using all the 20K oligopeptides of length K = 5 and 6 given by Qi et al.
Thus we can conclude that, the frequencies of a relatively small number
of oligopeptides of length 5, even if those oligopeptides are determined
in a random method, has phylogenetic information almost equivalent to
the frequencies of all the oligopeptides of length 5 or 6.

Introduction

One of the interesting problems in computational biology is that of reconstructing phylogenetic trees of microbial organisms from their genomes and/or proteomes. Furthermore, more available genomes and proteomes are making this
problem more challenging. A merit of studying this problem is that we can
gain an insight into evolution. In most of the previous works on this problem,
a distance-matrix between organisms is calculated and then a phylogenetic tree
is generated from the matrix using a distance-based phylogenetic tree generator
like UPGMA[14], Neighbor-Joining (NJ)[12], BIONJ[6], and NeighborNet[1].
Almost all the deﬁnitions of “distance” between two organisms are formulated

based on sequence alignment, including gene content [13, 15], presence-absence of
families of genes [4, 8], presence-absence of genes in clusters of orthologous genes
[16], supertree[2], and all-against-all genome-wide pairwise comparison [7].
Recently, Qi et al. [11] proposed a method for this problem, in which a vector
of attributes based on frequencies of all the oligopeptides of a ﬁxed length K = 5
or 6 in the complete proteome is used, in order to resolve the major branchings
with Archaea and Bacteria more accurately than the results of the previous
works and to avoid the inherent faults in sequence alignment. The distance between two arbitrary organisms is determined based on the angle between the
corresponding vectors of the organisms. The matrix of those distances is calculated, and is taken as input to a phylogenetic tree generator, Neighbor-Joining
[12]. They have applied their method to a set of 109 organisms, including 16
Archaea, 87 Bacteria, and 6 Eukarya, using a supercomputer, and reported that
their phylogenetic trees constructed from the attribute vectors agree with the
biologists’ “tree of life” [5] in a majority of basic branchings, and especially, in
all lower taxa.
Some natural questions of the work done by Qi et al. [11] are raised. All the
frequencies of 20K oligopeptides were used in their method. This requirement imposes a huge computation task, which is almost impossible in a current personal
computer. For example, if K = 6, for each of the 109 organisms, the frequencies
of 64,000,000 oligopeptides in the proteome should be calculated. Actually, a supercomputer was used to carry out their work. Our ﬁrst question is whether the
dimension of those vectors of oligopeptide frequencies can be reduced. Even if
this is possible, how oligopeptides eﬀective in reconstructing phylogenetic trees
are selected? The second question is whether there are other sequence attributes
of oligopeptides that are eﬀective in reconstructing phylogenetic trees. As various formulations of species-species distance based on sequence alignment were
discussed, various sequence attributes based on oligopeptide frequency should
be considered and compared in order to identify better ones.
In this paper, to gain some insight into these questions, we have proposed
a novel method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees using random sampling
of oligopeptides. In our method, a relatively small number N of oligopeptides
r1 , r2 , . . . , rN of a ﬁxed length k − 1 are randomly sampled from the complete
proteomes of all the given organisms. Let Σ = {a1 , . . . , a20 } be an alphabet
of symbols representing the 20 amino acids. For all the length-k oligopeptides
ri aj with 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ 20, the frequencies of the oligopeptides
in the proteomes of an organism are calculated. The frequencies constitute an
attribute vector of the organism. An additional advantage of this strategy is
that we can aﬀord to set k to be larger, e.g., k = 12, even if the computation
is carried out on a personal computer. The attributes that we have applied in
this work are the attribute of oligopeptide frequency used in [11] and another
oligopeptide frequency attribute based on a k-th order Markov chain over a
proteome. It should be noted here that the framework of our method is general
such that various kinds of attributes based on oligopeptides are applicable. This
random sampling procedure for making a phylogenetic tree is repeated several

times independently. A consensus tree of the resulting trees is calculated using
CONSENSE [10], whose software is provided as a part of PHYLIP [3].
In our preliminary computational experiments, we have applied our method
to the set of 109 organisms, including 16 Archaea, 87 Bacteria, and 6 Eukarya,
that is the same set of species as [11]. Our resulting trees agree with the biologists’
“tree of life” [5] in most of the basic taxa. In addition, they have almost the
same quality as the trees of the same organisms reconstructed using all the
20K oligopeptides of length K = 5 or 6, given by Qi et al. [11]. Thus we can
conclude that, with respect to the attribute of oligopeptide frequency in [11],
a relatively small number of oligopeptides of length 5 that are derived from
randomly sampled oligopeptides of length 4 has information almost equivalent
in reconstructing phylogenetic trees to all the oligopeptides of length 5 or 6.

Materials and Methods

In this section, the materials and methods we use here are described.
The set of organisms we use in this work is the same as the set of the organisms used in [11], which is 109 organisms, including 16 Archaea, 87 Bacteria,
and 6 Eukarya, to compare our phylogenetic trees with their ones. The set of
the protein sequences of an organisms is downloaded from “Genome Assembly/Annotation Projects” at the NCBI ftp site [17].
An overview of our method is given in Fig.1. Let n be the number of organisms. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we denote the set of all the protein sequences of the
i-th organism by Si . Let S = {S1 , . . . , Sn }. For a positive integer k, the length
of oligopeptides which are randomly samples from their complete proteomes is
set to be k − 1. Let N be the number of diﬀerent oligopeptides which are ran∗
domly sampled. An attribute function α is a function α : Σ × 2Σ → R, where
Σ = {a1 , . . . , a20 } is an alphabet of symbols representing the 20 amino acids.
We call the ﬁrst argument of α, which is an oligopeptide of length , a seed of α.
The second argument of α is supposed to be the set of all the protein sequences
of an organism. The details of each step in Fig. 1 are described as follows.

Input: positive integers k, N , and R.
Output: a phylogenetic tree.
Procedure:
1. Repeat the followings R times independently.
(a) A set of N diﬀerent oligopeptides of length k − 1 is randomly chosen from
S. The set is denoted by P = {p1 , . . . , pN }.
(b) For i = 1, . . . , n, a vector ui = (α(p1 a1 , Si ) · · · α(p1 a20 , Si ) · · ·
α(pN a1 , Si ) · · · α(pN a20 , Si )) is calculated.
(c) A distance matrix M among the n organisms is calculated from u1 , . . . , un .
(d) A phylogenetic trees is constructed from M .
2. A consensus tree of all the resulting trees is generated by CONSENSE[10].

The determination of seeds of an attribute function α is not completely random, but the preﬁxes of length k − 1 of seeds are chosen randomly from the
proteomes of the given organisms. For each randomly chosen preﬁx r, the strings
ra of length k are used as seeds, where a is a symbol representing an amino acid.
In this sense, the set of the resulting seeds is biased, which is more eﬀective in
reconstructing phylogenetic trees than a set of completely randomly sampled
oligopeptides of length k (data not shown). The procedure of the determination
of seeds is as follows. First, the following things are, in sequence, chosen uniformly
at randomly, respectively: (i) a species i, (ii) a protein sequence s in Si , (iii) a
position p ∈ {1, . . . , |s| − k + 2}. Then, the substring of s of length k − 1 starting
at p is added into a set P . This procedure is repeated until |P | = N . Next, from
each sampled oligopeptide r, 20 diﬀerent oligopeptides ra are generated, which
are used as seeds of an attribute function. Thus, in this case, the parameter
of α turns to be k. The size of the resulting set of seeds is 20N , denoted by
N . Thus, the vector of α for the i-th organism is (α(p1 a1 , Si ) . . . α(pN a20 , Si )),
whose dimension is N .
Here, the attribute function of oligopeptide frequency used in [11], which we
denote by α1 , is described brieﬂy. Let x = x1 · · · x be a string of length over
Σ and S ⊆ Σ ∗ . We denote the number of occurrences of x in s ∈ S by c(x, s).
p(x, S) =

c(x, s)

(|s| − + 1)

s∈S

s∈S

p0 (x, S) = p(x1 · · · x
α1 (x, S) =

−1 , S)p(x2

p0 (x,S)

0

· · · x , S)/p(x2 · · · x

−1 , S)

if p0 (x, S) = 0
otherwise

A feature of this attribute function is that the expectation p0 (x, S) of p(x, S)
is subtracted from p(x, S). This expectation is derived from a Markov model.
Note that the attribute function is a natural generalization of “dinucleotide
frequency” [9]. Another attribute function we consider in this work, denoted by
α2 , is described as follows. This is designed based on a partial ( − 1)-th order
Markov chain.
α2 (x, S) =

c(x, s)
s∈S

c(x1 · · · x

−1 a

, s) ,

s∈S a ∈Σ

Thus, α2 (x, S) represents the probability that the amino acid x occurs just after
x1 · · · x −1 occurs in the sequences in S. A feature of this attribute is that the
attribute is much easier to calculate rather than that of [11].
The distance between two arbitrary organisms is determined by the angle between the corresponding two attribute vectors. Let X and Y be attribute vectors
corresponding to two organisms. The distance between X and Y is deﬁned as
D(X, Y ) =

1−C(X,Y )

A phylogenetic tree is generated from n attribute vectors of the n organisms
using Neighbor-Joining [12], whose software is available as a part of a software package PHYLIP [3]. Note that an output tree of the method is unrooted.
In the ﬁnal step of our procedure, a consensus tree of the resulting trees calculated using R diﬀerent sets of N oligopeptides of length k is generated by
the CONSENSE[10] algorithm, whose software is also available as a part of
PHYLIP[3].
The diﬀerence between our procedure with the attribute function α1 and
that of [11] is that in our procedure, a relative small N oligopeptides are used
as seeds of α1 , on the other hand, all the 20K oligopeptides of length K are used
in [11]. The remaining parts, including the deﬁnition of the distance between two
organisms, the phylogenetic tree generator, and the consensus tree generator are
the same as those of [11].
We deﬁne a measure to evaluate how a reconstructed phylogenetic tree agrees
with the biologists’ “tree of life” shown in [5]. Let T be a unrooted phylogenetic
tree with the trifurcation of the three main domains, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Thus this measure is deﬁned for a tree with the trifurcation. The rooted
tree derived from T by making the trifurcation node rooted is denoted by T .
Let E be the set of the branches in T . For a branch e ∈ E, by Le we denote the
set of all the organisms assigned to the leaves that are descendants of the child
node of e. For a set C of organisms, we can determine the unique edge eC such
that C ⊆ LeC and |LeC | is minimized. We call eC the separator for C in T . The
unity of C in T is deﬁned as u(T, C) = |C|/|LeC |. The following taxa are considered to be C: Archaea(A), Bacteria(B), Eukaryotes(E), Crenarchaeota(A1),
Euryarchaeota(A2), Cyanobacteria(B10), Proteobacteria(B12), Alphaproteobacteria(B12.1), Betaproteobacteria(B12.2), Gammaproteobacteria(B12.3), Epsilonproteobacteria(B12.5), Firmicutes(B13), Actinobacteria(B14), Chlamydiae(B16),
and Spirochaetes(B17). Each taxon can be denoted by the code for it in Bergey’s
Manual if exists, which is given in parentheses. Since Eukaryotes are not included
in Bergey’s Manual, ’E’ is assigned to it temporarily.

Results

Tab. 1 shows how the consensus phylogenetic trees constructed by the method
in Fig. 1 with k = 5 and the trees in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 in [11] agree with the
biologists’ “tree of life” shown in [5]. Recall that the tree in Fig. 2 and Fig. 1
in [11] are generated using all the oligopeptides of length 5 and 6, respectively,
and that the trees agree with the biologists’ “tree of life” [5] in a majority of
basic branchings, and especially, in all lower taxa. As we can see in Tab. 1,
the consensus trees constructed by the random sampling method with k = 5
have achieved almost the same quality as the tree in Fig. 2 and Fig. 1 in [11].
Surprisingly, the unities in the consensus tree with N = 280, 000 are all better
or equal to those in Fig. 2 in [11]. It should be noted here that the number of
seeds of α1 used in constructing these trees are N = 280, 000 and 3, 200, 000,
respectively, so the former is only 8.75% of the latter. For Fig. 1 in [11], the

consensus tree with N = 360, 000, given in Fig. 2, is quite a similar to the tree
with respect to the unity scores. Our tree wins the unities of B12.2, B12.3, and
B13 and loses only the unity of A2. A drawback of the consensus tree in Fig.
2 is that E. coli (B12.C3.O13.F1.G1) and S. flexneri 2a (B12.C3.O13.F1.G37)
are mixed, although the other genera come together as they should.
These results imply that the set of all the oligopeptides of a ﬁxed length are redundant with respect to reconstructing phylogenetic trees through the attribute
function α1 . In addition, we can say that if a certain amount of oligopeptides are
used to be seeds of α1 , it is not important how to select oligopeptides eﬀective
in reconstructing phylogenetic trees.

Discussion

For the attribute function α1 , we have also constructed phylogenetic trees with
the diﬀerent values of k, the length of oligopeptides sampled randomly. For
k = 6, . . . , 15, we have carried out our method with N = 100, 000, 200, 000
and 400, 000, and R = 6. Interestingly, all the consensus trees are inferior to
those of k = 5 so some amount of oligopeptides of length 5 would have more
phylogenetically valuable information on microbial organisms.
We have also applied our method with another attribute function α2 , which
is an attribute based on a k-th order Markov chain over a proteome. We have

Fig. 2. A phylogenetic tree for 109 organisms constructed with the parameters
k = 5, R = 10, and N = 360, 000. The abbreviations of the names of the 109 organisms are assigned to the corresponding leaves, respectively. The deﬁnitions of those
abbreviations can be found in [11]. The trifurcation of the three domains is pointed
out by the bold long arrow. Circles on the branches show the range of frequencies f of
appearances of the branches: f ∈ (0.8, 1.0] (red), f ∈ (0.6, 0.8] (yellow), f ∈ (0.4, 0.6]
(green), and f ∈ [0.0, 0.4] (blue)

constructed consensus trees with the same parameter sets as the cases of α1 . The
result is that any consensus trees have no trifurcations. Further investigation into
attribute functions would be needed.
