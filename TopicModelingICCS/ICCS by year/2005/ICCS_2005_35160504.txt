Abstract. The physics laws, which govern the atmospheric phenomena, are
mostly non-linear and therefore the application of the conventional Fourier
spectral analysis on the time series of the atmospheric quantities reveals that
these are usually non-stationary. Quite often these non-stationarities conceals
the existing correlations and therefore new analytical techniques capable to
eliminate non-stationarities in the data should be employed. The most recent
analytical methods used along these lines are the wavelet techniques and the
detrended fluctuation analysis. Much attention has been paid recently to the
latter technique, which has already proved its usefulness in a large variety of
complex systems. As a paradigm, the detrended fluctuation analysis is applied
to the column ozone data. Specifically the zonally and globally averaged
column ozone observations conducted by ground-based (1964-2004) and
satellite-borne (1979-2003) instrumentation are employed to detect long-range
correlations in column ozone time series. The results show that column ozone
fluctuations exhibit persistent long-range power-law correlations for all time
lags between 4 months - 11 years.

1 Introduction
Trends in total ozone content (TOZ) are caused by external effects and they are
usually supposed to have a smooth and monotonous or slowly oscillating behavior.
Therefore, for the reliable detection of long-range correlations, it is essential to
distinguish trends from the long-range fluctuations intrinsic in the data. Usually, the
short-range correlations are described by the autocorrelation function, which declines
exponentially with a certain decay time. For the long-range correlations, however, the
autocorrelation function declines as a power-law. However, the direct calculation of
the autocorrelation function is usually not appropriate due to noise superimposed on
the collected data and due to underlying trends of unknown origin. The detrended
fluctuation analysis (DFA), which will be discussed later, is a well established method
for determining the scaling behavior of noisy data in the presence of trends without
knowing their origin and shape.

Very recently, Varotsos [2005] showed that the amplitudes of large TOZ
fluctuations (in seasons of enhanced ozone depletion) obey a power-law scaling. This
means that correlations between these points decrease according to a power law and
are therefore scale-invariant. He also suggested that the Arctic and Antarctic TOZ
fluctuations exhibit persistent long-range correlations for all time lags between 4 days
- 2.5 years. This means that TOZ fluctuations at different times are correlated and the
corresponding correlation function decays much slower than the exponential decay,
i.e. a power-law decay. In other words persistence refers to the “memory” or internal
correlation within the TOZ time series. For example, there is a tendency an increase
in TOZ to be followed by another increase in TOZ at a different time. Furthermore he
demonstrated the crucial role of the planetary waves to the scaling dynamics of TOZ
over the high latitudes in both hemispheres, since the elimination of the TOZ longterm trend leads to persistent (antipersistent) long-range power-law correlations for
time lags shorter (longer) than 10 days. It is worth noting here that a series is
persistent if adjacent values are positively correlated, whereas a series is antipersistent
if adjacent values are inversely correlated.
To reach to the aforementioned conclusions Varotsos [2005] employed the DFA
method, which as mentioned above, allows the detection of long-range power-law
correlations in a time-series with noise that often can mask true correlations. In this
respect, due to the fact that the physics laws, which govern the atmospheric
phenomena, are mostly non-linear, the application of the conventional Fourier
spectral analysis on the time series of the atmospheric quantities reveals that these are
usually non-stationary (the correlation functions are not invariant under time
translation) (Chen et al. 2002, and references therein). Quite often these nonstationarities (e.g. trends and cycles) conceals the existing correlations (or other
intrinsic properties) and therefore new analytical techniques capable to eliminate nonstationarities in the data should be employed (Hu et al. 2001).
The most recent methods used along these lines are the wavelet techniques (e.g.
Koscielny-Bunde et al. 1998) and the DFA that introduced by Peng et al. (1994).
Much attention has been paid recently to the latter technique, which has already
proved its usefulness in a large variety of complex systems, for example, in southern
oscillation index, in turbulence, in biology, in financial analysis and in other selforganizing critical systems (e.g. Ausloos and Ivanova, 2001; Weber, and Talkner,
2001; Chen et al. 2002; Varotsos et al. 2003ab; Collette and Ausloos 2004).
The present paper examines the time scaling of the TOZ fluctuations over the
tropical and mid-latitudinal zones of both hemispheres and globally, thus contributing
to the attempt for a selected choice between the proposed climate models for a
projection of the TOZ levels in the future, taking into account the feedback between
climate change and the ozone layer.

2 The Time Scaling and Correlations of the TOZ Fluctuations
The zonally and globally averaged TOZ observations performed by ground-based
(1964-2004) and satellite-borne (1979-2003) instrumentation is used in order to

efficiently search for time scaling, by adopting, however, a data analysis technique,
which is not debatable due to the non-stationarity of the data. Thus, to study the
temporal correlations of TOZ fluctuations the method of DFA with acceptable error
bars is herewith used. This method stems from random walk theory, and permits the
detection of intrinsic self-similarity in non-stationary time series (Talkner and Weber
2000). Therefore, this method has the advantage of avoiding seasonal-like trends and
non-stationarity effects. According to DFA method, the time series is first integrated
and then it is divided into boxes of equal length, ∆t. In each box, a least squares line
(or polynomial curve of order l, DFA-l) is then fitted, in order to detrend the
integrated time series by subtracting the locally fitted trend in each box. The rootmean-square (rms) fluctuations Fd(∆t) of this integrated and detrended time series is
calculated over all time scales (box sizes). More specifically, the detrended
fluctuation function F(τ) is calculated as follows (Kantelhardt et al. 2002):

F 2 (τ ) =

1 ( k +1)τ
⎛N
⎞
[ y (t ) − z (t )]2 , k=0, 1, 2, …, ⎜ − 1⎟
∑
τ t = kτ +1
⎝τ
⎠

(1)

where z(t) = at+b is the linear least-square fit to the τ data points contained into a
class.
For scaling dynamics, the averaged F2(τ) over the N/τ intervals with length τ is
expected to obey a power-law, notably:

F 2 (τ ) ~ τ 2α

(2)

and the power spectrum function scales with 1/f β, with β=2α –1.
An exponent α ≠1/2 in a certain range of τ values implies the existence of longrange correlations in that time interval as, for example, in fractional Brownian motion,
while α = 1/2 corresponds to the classical random walk (white noise). If 0 < α < 0.5,
power-law anticorrelations are present (antipersistence). If 0.5 < α ≤ 1.0, then 0 < β
≤ 1, and persistent long-range power-law correlations prevail; the case β=1 (α =1)
corresponds to the so-called 1/f noise. In addition, when 1< α <1.5, then long-range
correlations are again present (but are stronger than in the previous case); the value α
=1.5 corresponds to the Brownian noise (e.g., Talkner and Weber, 2000).
It is worth noting that since the time series is first summed the noise level due to
imperfect observations is reduced.
It has recently been recognized (Hu et al, 2001) that the existence of long-term
trends in a time series may influence the results of the correlation analysis. Therefore,
the effects of TOZ trends have to be distinguished from TOZ intrinsic fluctuations.
To this end, before applying scaling analysis to the TOZ time-series, all TOZ data
were deseasonalized and detrended.
In Figure 1, a log-log plot of the function Fd =

F 2 (τ ) is shown, by employing

the DFA-1 to the deaseasonalised and detrended monthly mean values of the groundbased TOZ values, during 1964-2003, over the belt 90°S-90°N. Since α = 1.1 (± 0.13)

for the interval time ranging from about 4 months to 11 years long-range correlations
are present. This suggests persistent long-range power-law correlations in global TOZ
fluctuations. This persistence suggests that an anomaly in global TOZ in one time
frame continues into the next.

In the following, the temporal correlations of the deaseasonalised and detrended
monthly mean values of TOZ are also examined for the belt 25°S-25°N during 19642003. The result obtained from the application of the DFA-1 to the aforementioned
TOZ values over tropics is presented at Figure 2. The finding drawn from this figure
(α = 1.1 ± 0.11) is that TOZ over tropics exhibits persistent long-range power-law
correlations for the interval time ranging from about 4 months to 11 years.
It is worth noting that similar to the above-discussed results are also found by
applying the DFA-1 method to the monthly zonal mean V8 TOZ values over tropics
and globally.
We now turn to the extra-tropics and specifically to the ground-based TOZ data for
the latitude belt 25°N-60°N during 1964-2003. The application of the DFA-1 method
to these deseasonalised and detrended monthly mean values of TOZ reveals that longrange power-law correlations exist for all time scales (fig.3a). Since α1 = 1.2 ± 0.13
(for time scales shorter than 2 years) the long-range correlations in TOZ exhibit
“stronger memory” (the process forgets more slowly its past behavior) compared to
that of α2 = 0.6 ± 0.09 (for time scales longer than 2 years). Higher persistence implies
a stronger correlation between successive data points. It is also worth noting that
“memory” or correlations exist at all time scales over which the power law is valid.

Finally, the DFA-1 method is also applied on the deseasonalised and detrended
monthly mean values of TOZ in the latitude belt 25°S-60°S during 1964-2003. The
results obtained are depicted in Fig.3b, where persistency of TOZ fluctuations is
observed. In particular, for time scales shorter (longer) than 2 years α1 = 1.1 ± 0.11 (α2
= 0.6 ± 0.07).

It is worth mentioning that similar to the above-discussed results for the TOZ
variability over extra-tropics are also found by applying the DFA-1 method to the
monthly zonal mean V8 TOZ values.
The results obtained clearly show that the monthly mean column ozone
fluctuations over tropics, extra-tropics and globally exhibit persistent long-range
correlations for all time lags between 4 months - 11 years, which correspond to the 1/f
noise. Over extra-tropics, this persistency becomes weaker for time lags between 2-11
years. It is well known that the 1/f noise is one of the most common features in nature.
Superposition of effects giving rise to signals with scale invariant distributions of
correlation times, the so-called scale similarity, could be on the basis of the observed
behavior. However, a proper explanation for such a behavior is still lacking and for
this reason the physical origin of the 1/f noise is pretty much an open question
(Fanchiotti et al, 2004).
The aforementioned findings seem to favor specific models for the description of
the ozone depletion and may lead to better predictability on the global TOZ evolution
along the lines of nonlinear dynamics.

3 Conclusions
The investigation of the existence of the long-range correlations to the zonally and
globally averaged column ozone data derived from observations performed by
ground-based (1964-2004) and satellite-borne (1979-2003) instrumentation shows the
following:

The monthly mean column ozone fluctuations over tropics, extra-tropics and
globally exhibit persistent long-range correlations for all time lags between 4 months
- 11 years, which correspond to the 1/f noise. Over extra-tropics, this persistency
becomes weaker for time lags between 2-11 years.
The above-mentioned findings demonstrate the nature of specific atmospheric
mechanisms that operate and affect the ozone layer in a power law fashion. These
could also be a good test of atmospheric chemistry-transport models. Apart from
reproducing instantaneous absolute values, model results should also demonstrate the
scaling behavior.
