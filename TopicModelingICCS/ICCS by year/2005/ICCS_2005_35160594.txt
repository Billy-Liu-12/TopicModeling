Abstract. Since the introduction of CAS (Computer Algebra Systems), educators are experimenting new ways of teaching with the aim to enhance many
aspects of the learning mathematics. In particular, visualization can aid the understanding of concepts. The graphical potentialities of many CAS, in fact,
allow students to discover concepts, relationships, rules, so as to construct their
knowledge for themselves. The aim of this work is to present a Mathematica
notebook that enables students to use visualization skills to better grasp the
mathematical concepts of the pointwise and uniform convergence of power
series.

1 Visualization in Mathematics Teaching
Visualization, as a technique for teaching mathematics, has become importante specially
in those countries where graphics calculators are widely used. Mathematical concepts,
ideas and methods have a great wealth of visual relationships, and their use and manipulation is clearly very beneficial from the point of view of their presentation.
Visualization means illustration of an object, fact, process, concept, and its result
can be graphic, numeric, or algebraic. Today the term is mostly used for graphic illustrations. Visualization tools can be used in an interpretative and expressive way
(Gordin, Edelson and Gomez, 1996).
Interpretative tools can support learners in extracting meaning from the information being visualized, in clarifying text and abstract concepts making them more comprehensible. Expressive visualization can be used to visually convey meaning in order
to communicate a set of beliefs.
When using a calculator as a visualization tool the immediate feedback is of central
importance. The illustration of concepts helps students to understand them, to associate them with something that is not abstract and the visual association aids to memorize them. Student become able to "see" the meaning of abstract patterns, interacting
visually with mathematics.
Mathematica, being a powerful tool for computing, programming, data analysis
and visualization of information, is able to catch students' interests, to challenge them
and to make learning more interesting.
The use of Mathematica notebooks, as a support to traditional lessons, can help
students in understanding some concepts, since they are personally involved in experimentation and discovery. We have introduced them in the traditional curriculum
for some years, within a research addressed to the development of innovative ways of
mathematics teaching using Mathematica.

Here we describe a notebook that can offer useful visualization of the concepts of
pointwise and uniform convergence of power series.

2 Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Power Series
The notebook, we are going to illustrate, has been realized with the aim to aid students to reach a deeper knowledge of the concepts of pointwise and uniform convergence of power series. Students used it after traditional lessons on the above contents
in order to explore the meaning of convergence.
To introduce the convergence of power series, we recall the following definitions.

Definition 1. Let I be a subset of R,

{f } ,
n

f n : I → ℝ, be a sequence of functions,

and let f : I → ℝ be another function. We say that f n → f
- pointwise on I if ∀x ∈ I and ∀ε > 0 ∃ N (x, ∈) such that n > N ⇒ f n (x ) − f (x ) < ∈

- uniformly on I if ∀ ∈> 0 ∃ N (∈) such that n > N ⇒ f n (x ) − f (x ) < ∈, ∀x ∈ I .

The graphics in Figure 1 illustrates how, for sufficiently large n, the n-th function
1
f n (x ) = xe − nx lies completely below any given level (in the form
). In this case, for
en
simplicity, the (uniform) limit is identically zero, so that close to the limit simply
means small. In the case of (pointwise but) non uniform convergence, the n-th
function stays below any given level, but not globally: the maximum is essentially the
same for all functions (here f n (x ) = nxe − nx ).

Definition 2. The series s (x ) = ∑ u k (x ) converges pointwise to the function s if the
k =1

n

sequence s n = ∑ u k (x ) converges pointwise to the function s.

Definition 3. The series s (x ) = ∑ u k (x ) converges uniformly to the function s if the
k =1

sequence s n (x ) converges uniformly to the function s.
Let us go to visually study the convergence of some power series.

As we can see the geometric series does not converge, since the points representing
the partial sums do not "head" towards a definite point. Let us consider (Fig. 3) the
 3 4i 
behaviour of the first 200 partial sums in a point, 0.99 +  , inside the circle of

convergence is slow: the sums slowly spiral towards their limit. Let us consider (Fig.

3 Uniform Convergence
Let us define a general function that allows to study the behaviour of the partial sums
of a power series in a chosen point.

Let us try to understand the meaning of uniform convergence, observing the behaviour of the partial sums in different points, in polar coordinates (i.e. we pick up points
in given directions and on several circles around the origin).

As we can see the convergence is faster in the points far from the boundary of the
convergence circle, and becomes slow near the boundary.

The series does not converge uniformly, in fact the convergence "rates" depends in
an essential manner on the point.

With different general terms,

(Fig. 7), we see the same general

pattern as before, but the convergence rate is a trifle higher (spirals are someway
smoother).

We "see" that the spirals have the same general ("uniform") structure. The second
series is still "more uniform" example: as Euler would have said, an "augmented convergence".

Conclusions

The realization of this notebook encourages the use of computer graphical capabilities
in teaching mathematics contents in University courses. The results of their use can be
seen as a step towards the introduction of innovative modes in the process of teaching
and learning. As a result of the experimentation students have enhanced their
understanding of the illustrated concepts, learning in a more enjoyable way.
