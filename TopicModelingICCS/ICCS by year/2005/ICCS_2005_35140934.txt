Abstract. This paper proposes an automatic hepatic tumor segmentation
method of a computed tomography (CT) image using statistical optimal
threshold. The liver structure is first segmented using histogram transformation,
multi-modal threshold, maximum a posteriori decision, and binary
morphological filtering. Hepatic vessels are removed from the liver because
hepatic vessels are not related to tumor segmentation. Statistical optimal
threshold is calculated by a transformed mixture probability density and
minimum total probability error. Then a hepatic tumor is segmented using the
optimal threshold value. In order to test the proposed method, 262 slices from
10 patients were selected. Experimental results show that the proposed method
is very useful for diagnosis of the normal and abnormal liver.

1 Introduction
Liver cancer, which is the fifth most common cancer, is more serious in areas of
western and central Africa and eastern and southeastern Asia [1]. The average
incidence of liver cancer in these areas is 20 per 100,000, and liver cancer is the third
highest death cause from cancer [1]. In Korea, the incidence of liver cancer is quite
high at 19% for males and 7% for females [2].. In order to improve the curability of
liver cancer, early detection is critical. Liver cancer, like other cancers, manifests
itself with abnormal cells, conglomerated growth, and tumor formation. If the hepatic
tumor is detected early, treatment and curing of a patient may be easy, and human life
can be prolonged.
Liver segmentation using CT images has been vigorously performed because CT is
a very conventional and non-invasive technique. Bae et al. [3] used priori information
about liver morphology and image processing techniques. Gao et al. [4] developed
automatic liver segmentation using a global histogram, morphologic operations, and
the parametrically deformable contour model. Park et al. [5] built a probabilistic atlas
of the brain and extended abdominal segmentation including the liver, kidneys, and

spinal cord. Tsai [6] proposed an alternative segmentation method using an artificial
neural network to classify each pixel into three categories. Also, Husain et al. [7] used
neural networks for feature-based recognition of liver region. Pan et al. [8] presented
a level set technique for the automatic liver segmentation by proposing a novel speed
function. Seo et al. [9] proposed fully automatic liver segmentation based on the
spine. However, most previous research has been concentrated on only liver
segmentation and volume construction. In this paper, a simple automatic hepatic
tumor segmentation method using statistical optimal threshold (SOT) is proposed. An
automatic hepatic tumor segmentation method is presented in the following section.
Experiments and analysis of results are described in the next section. Finally, the
conclusion will be drawn in the last section.

2 Hepatic Tumor Segmentation
In this section, an automatic hepatic tumor segmentation method is presented. A liver
structure is first segmented and then vessels in the liver are removed. Statistical
optimal threshold (SOT) is found by transformed mixture probability density (MPD)
and minimum total probability error (MTPE). A region of interest (ROI) of a hepatic
tumor is segmented and estimated.
2.1 Liver Segmentation
The first important work to segment a hepatic tumor is to segment a liver boundary.
The ROI of the liver is extracted using histogram transformation [10], multi-modal
threshold [11], and maximum a posteriori decision [12]. In order to eliminate other
abdominal organs such as the heart and right kidney, binary morphological (BM)
filtering is performed by dilation, erosion, closing, and filling [13, 14, 15]. Fig. 1(a)
shows an abnormal CT image with a tumor. Fig. 1(b) shows the ROI of the liver. Also,
Fig. 1(c) shows the segmented liver image using BM filtering.

2.2 Vessel Elimination
The liver image with a tumor obtained by BM filtering consists of the pure liver,
tumor, and vessels. As vessels of the liver have no influence on tumor segmentation,
vessels are eliminated from the liver. Histogram transformation for better histogram

threshold is first performed to reduce histogram noises. Then the left and right
valleys, called object ranges, are calculated using a piecewise linear interpolation
method [11]. The vessel range is located in the rightmost side of the histogram
because pixel values are higher than other objects. Therefore, the vessel range is
decided easily. Fig. 2(a) shows the liver image after vessel elimination.
2.3 Statistical Optimal Threshold
After eliminating vessels, the histogram has only two peaks, and the liver image
consists of the pure liver and tumor region. Therefore, the gray-level value
thresholding two regions is easily calculated by using multi-modal threshold method.
However, we do not know this threshold value is optimal. In order to find the SOT
value, Toptimal , the histogram of the liver is transformed. The histogram with two
peaks as the mixture probability density (MPD) is expressed as

3 Experiments and Analysis
CT images to be used in this research were provided by Chonnam National University
Hospital in Kwangju, Korea. The CT scans were obtained by using a LightSpeed
Qx/i, which was produced by GE Medical Systems. Scanning was performed with
intravenous contrast enhancement. Also, the scanning parameters used a tube current
of 230 mAs and 120 kVp, a 30 cm field of view, 5 mm collimation and a table speed
of 15 mm/sec (pitch factor, 1:3).
Ten patients were selected for testing the new proposed method to segregate a
hepatic tumor. Five people had normal livers and the other five people had abnormal
livers. 262 total slices from ten patients were used. One radiologist took part in this
research in order to evaluate liver status. Fig. 3 shows examples of segmented tumors.
Table 1 shows the data of evaluated slices followed by slice numbers, true negative
(TN), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true positive (TP) [17].

As the evaluation measure, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated.
As sensitivity represents the fraction of patients with disease who test positive,
sensitivity is defined as

Sensitivity =

As specificity represents the fraction of patients without disease who test negative,
specificity is defined as

Specificity =

In this research, we had 0.6471 of sensitivity, 0.9306 of specificity, and 0.9122 of
accuracy. These results show the proposed method is very useful for diagnosis of the
normal liver. Values of FP and FN are high for tumors located in the left portal branch
and tumors with a diameter less than 2 cm.

hepatic vessels were not related to tumor segmentation. Then statistical optimal
threshold was calculated by a transformed mixture probability density and minimum
total probability error. Finally, a hepatic tumor was segmented using the optimal
threshold value. In order to evaluate the proposed method, 262 slices from 10 patients
were selected. From the evaluation results, we had 0.6471 of sensitivity, 0.9306 of
specificity, and 0.9122 of accuracy. These results show that the proposed method is
very useful for diagnosis of normal and abnormal livers. In the future, algorithms for
reducing false positives of the left portal branch will be developed.
