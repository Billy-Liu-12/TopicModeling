Abstract. This paper discusses several aspects related to the consistency and stability of the discrete adjoints of upwind numerical schemes.
First and third order upwind discretizations of the one-dimensional advection equation are considered in both the ﬁnite diﬀerence and ﬁnite
volume formulations. We show that the discrete adjoints may lose consistency and stability near the points where upwinding is changed, and near
inﬂow boundaries where the numerical scheme is changed. The impact
of adjoint inconsistency and instability on data assimilation is analyzed.

Introduction

Adjoint models [3] are widely used in control and in data assimilation in conjunction with the optimization of large scale models. The adjoint methodology
can eﬃciently provide gradients of objective functionals that are formulated in
terms of the state of the model.
There are two ways to derive adjoint models [8]. The continuous approach
solves numerically the adjoint equation derived from the forward model. The discrete approach formulates directly the adjoint of the forward numerical scheme.
The discrete approach is highly attractive since the discrete adjoints, in principle,
can be generated automatically [1].
Discrete adjoints of upwind numerical methods pose particular challenges.
Symes and Sei [7] pointed out that the consistency of the numerical scheme is
not automatically inherited by its discrete adjoint due to the upwind character
of the forward scheme. Giles studied the construction and properties of discrete
adjoints for hyperbolic systems with shocks [4, 5]. Homescu and Navon [6] discuss
the optimal control of ﬂows with discontinuities.
In this paper we study the consistency and stability of discrete adjoints for
upwind numerical schemes. The focus is on the advection equation

Advection is the prototype for hyperbolic problems requiring upwinding, and is
in itself a fundamental model with many applications. Our discussion includes
the case where the wind ﬁeld has sources and sinks. This situation arises in the
directional split solutions of multidimensional advection equation. The consideration of sources and sinks is also important for being able to later extend the
results to nonlinear systems.
The paper is organized as follows. The consistency analysis in carried out
in Section 2 and the stability analysis in Section 3. Numerical examples are
provided in Section 4 and Section 5 summarizes the main ﬁndings of this work.

Consistency Analysis

In this section we consider several upwind discretizations of (1) and study the
consistency of their discrete adjoint schemes with the continuous equation (2).
2.1

First Order Finite Diﬀerence Scheme

Forward Scheme. We start with the ﬁrst order upwind discretization
Ci = (1/∆x) γi+ fi−1 + (γi− − γi+ )fi − γi− fi+1 ,
γi+ = 1 if Ui ≥ 0 ,

γi+ = 0 if Ui < 0 ,

γ− = 1 − γ+ ,

(3)

fi = Ui Ci .

The Dirichlet boundary conditions are C0 = CLB and CN +1 = CRB . Here, and
throughout the paper, C denotes the time derivative of C.
Adjoint Scheme. The corresponding discrete adjoint is
−
+
λi = (Ui /∆x) −γi−1
λi−1 + (γi− − γi+ )λi + γi+1
λi+1

(4)

with the boundary conditions λ0 = λN +1 = 0 .
Consistency inside the domain. If the wind direction is the same throughout the
stencil (i-1,i,i+1) then equation (4) is simply the ﬁrst order spatial discretization
method applied to (2). In this case consistency is assured.
We now consider the case where a shift in the wind direction occurs inside
the stencil, e.g., Ui−1 < 0 and Ui , Ui+1 ≥ 0. The discrete adjoint (4) is:
λi = (Ui /∆x) [−λi−1 − λi + λi+1 ]

(5)

The Taylor expansion of the above scheme around the ith node reveals that
the the method is formally inconsistent with the continuous adjoint equation.
The continuous wind velocity is small around the point of sign change, U =
O(∆xm ), and from (5) we have that λ = O(∆xm−1 ). The consistency is maintained if m > 1, and is lost for m ≤ 1. The latter situation includes the most
common situation were U = O(∆x), and also the case of a discontinuous wind
ﬁeld U = O(1).

Consistency near the boundary. The adjoint inﬂow boundary condition for U0 <
0 is λ0 = 0. The discrete adjoint scheme near the boundary
λ1 = (U1 /∆x) −γ0− λ0 + (γ1− − γ1+ )λ1 + γ2+ λ2

(6)

is consistent with the adjoint equation.
In conclusion the discrete adjoint of the ﬁrst order upwind scheme is inconsistent near sources and sinks, and is consistent near the boundaries.
2.2

Third Order Finite Diﬀerence Scheme

Consistency inside the domain. The analysis is similar to the ﬁrst order case.
If the wind direction is the same throughout the stencil (i-2,i-1,i,i+1,i+2) the
equation (8) is consistent with the continuous adjoint. If the wind sign changes
(i.e., there is a source or a sink) inside the stencil then U = O(∆xm ), and the
scheme is inconsistent for m ≤ 1.
Consistency near the boundary. The numerical scheme (7) shifts to a lower order,
smaller stencil method near the boundaries. With an inﬂow left boundary the
discrete adjoint equation for the ﬁrst node is:
λ1 = (U1 /∆x) −λ1 + λ2 − 16 λ3

(9)

This should reﬂect an outﬂow condition for the adjoint. However (9) is inconsistent with the continuous equation (2).

schemes of the form

A similar analysis revealed that: (1) the discrete adjoint of the ﬁrst order
ﬁnite volume scheme is consistent with the adjoint equation except for the points
where there is a sink or source; (2) the discrete adjoint of the ﬁrst order ﬁnite
volume scheme is consistent at the boundaries; (3) the discrete adjoint of the
third order ﬁnite volume scheme is consistent except for the case when there are
sinks or sources of velocity within the stencil (when it becomes inconsistent); and
(4)the discrete adjoint of the third order ﬁnite volume scheme is not consistent
at nodes near the inﬂow boundary.

Stability Analysis

In this section the von Neumann stability analysis of the discrete adjoints is
carried out for the ﬁnite diﬀerence formulations.
The ﬁrst order spatial discretization leads to the system (3) of ordinary diﬀerential equations, which is resolved in time using the forward Euler method. The
Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) stability condition for the fully discrete forward
scheme is σ ≤ 1, where σ is the Courant number. The adjoint of the fully discrete
scheme is the equation (4) resolved in time with the forward Euler method.
The system of ordinary diﬀerential equations resulting from the third order
spatial discretization (7) is resolved in time with the strongly stable, two stage,
second order explicit Runge-Kutta method
Cα = Cn + A Cn ,

Cβ = Cα + A Cα ,

C n+1 = 12 (C n + C β ) .

(13)

The CFL stability condition for the fully discrete forward scheme is σ ≤ 0.87.
The corresponding discrete adjoint is the equation (8), resolved in time with the
same Runge-Kutta scheme (13).

Analysis of Discrete Adjoints for Upwind Numerical Schemes

833

We are concerned with the stability of the resulting discrete adjoints. In
the interest of brevity we omit the derivation and present directly the results.
The von Neumann stability analysis reveals the dependency of the ampliﬁcation
factors on the Courant number (σ) and on the wave number (θ = k∆x/(2π)).
Fig. 1 presents the areas of stability (white) and instability (gray) in the (σ, θ)
plane for diﬀerent situations.
The stability of the ﬁrst order discrete adjoint is the same as for the forward
method when all wind directions in the stencil (i-1,i,i+1) are the same. However,
as seen in Fig. 1(a), when the wind changes direction inside the stencil a stricter
stability condition (σ ≤ 0.4) is required.
Fig. 1(b) reveals that the stability of the third order discrete adjoint is the
same as for the forward method when the wind does not change direction within
the stencil (i-2,· · ·,i+2). Fig. 1(d) shows that the discrete adjoint is stable with
a slightly restricted Courant number if the wind is negative in the leftmost
two stencil points. An interesting situation arises when the wind is negative in
only the leftmost grid point. In this case the discrete adjoint is unconditionally
unstable as seen in Fig. 1(c).

Numerical Examples

To illustrate the inconsistency we use the discrete adjoint method to solve the
adjoint equation. The initial condition is a sine function, and the numerical
adjoint solutions after backward integration are shown in Fig. 2.
First we consider a linear wind ﬁeld that has negative values in left half and
positive values in the right half of the domain. The center is a source with zero
velocity and both boundaries are outﬂow boundaries. Both the ﬁrst order (Fig.
2(a)) and third order discrete adjoint solutions (Fig. 2(b)) are corrupted by the
inconsistency near the central source.

Next we consider a linear wind ﬁeld with opposite sign. The center of the
domain is now a sink with zero velocity and both boundaries are inﬂow boundaries. Both the ﬁrst order (Fig. 2(c)) and third order discrete adjoint solutions
(Fig. 2(d)) are corrupted by the inconsistency near the central sink. Moreover,
the third order discrete adjoint is inconsistent near the boundaries (Fig. 2(d)) .

Fig. 2. The discrete adjoint solutions is not consistent with the continuous adjoint
near sources/sinks. In addition, the third order solution is also inconsistent near inﬂow
boundaries

We now assess the inﬂuence of inconsistency and instability on variational
data assimilation. The limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm
L-BFGS [2] is used to recover the initial conditions from observations of the
solution at selected grid points and time moments. Assimilation experiments (not
reported here) revealed that the convergence rates of the optimization process
are nearly identical with discrete and with continuous adjoints as long as the
Courant number is small. Consequently the inconsistency and instability of the
discrete adjoints do not seem to impact visibly the data assimilation process.
The results of several assimilation experiments are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a)
corresponds to a constant, positive wind ﬁeld. The inﬂow (left) boundary adjoint
inconsistency does not aﬀect the optimization and the recovered initial condition
matches well the reference. Fig. 3(b) is for a piecewise constant wind ﬁeld, with
a source in the center and two outﬂow boundaries. The recovery near the source
is good, however the recovery near the boundaries is poor. This is due to the
information loss when the “particles” exit the domain. Fig. 3(c) considers a
linear wind ﬁeld, with a source of zero velocity in the center and two outﬂow

boundaries. The recovery of the left outﬂow boundary is inaccurate, as expected.
The recovery of the right outﬂow boundary is accurate due to the observation
point placed on the boundary grid point. The error in recovered initial condition
near the center is due to the very small wind speed. The “particles” cannot reach
the nearest observation point during the simulation, which results in information
loss. Fig. 3(d) is for piecewise constant wind ﬁeld, with a sink in the center
and two inﬂow boundaries. The recovery error near the center is due to the
information loss when the “particles” disappear into the sink (note that there
is no observation point at the sink). Both sinks and sources lead to inconsistent
discrete adjoints, however the recovery of the initial condition is diﬃcult only
for the sinks. Consequently, the recovery error is due to information loss and not
to inconsistency.

Conclusions

In this paper we analyze the consistency and stability of discrete adjoints for
upwind numerical schemes. The focus is on ﬁrst and third order upwind discretizations of the one-dimensional advection equation.
The discrete adjoints are inconsistent with the continuous adjoint equation
at inﬂow boundaries and near sinks or sources (i.e., points where the wind ﬁeld
changes sign). The von Neumann stability of the forward numerical scheme is

836

not automatically maintained by the adjoint operation. Depending on the upwinding direction of diﬀerent points inside the stencil the discrete adjoint can
be: (1) linearly stable with a CFL time step restriction similar to that of the
forward method, (2) linearly stable under a more stringent CFL condition, or
(3) unconditionally unstable at a given point near sources or sinks.
The inconsistency and instability do not aﬀect the performance of the optimization procedure in the data assimilation examples considered here. Both
discrete and continuous adjoints lead to similar convergence rates for the recovery of the initial conditions. However, the optimization process is hindered by
the loss of information occurring when: (1) the solution collapses into a sink or
a shock; (2) the solution exits the domain through an outﬂow boundary; and
(3) the solution features propagate only on a short distance, insuﬃcient to reach
one of the observation sites.
