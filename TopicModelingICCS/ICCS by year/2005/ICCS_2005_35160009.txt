Abstract. In this paper, we consider subgrid modeling of a ﬁltration
ﬂow of a ﬂuid in a nonhomogeneous porous medium. An expression for
the eﬀective permeability coeﬃcient for the large-scale component of the
ﬂow is derived. The permeability coeﬃcient possesses a log-stable distribution. The obtained formulas are veriﬁed by the numerical modeling.

Introduction

Field and laboratory observational data imply that such parameters as permeability ﬁeld and porosity have rather an irregular varying character. In this case
small-scale details of permeability and porosity are unknown. The latter are taken
into consideration in the statistical models [1],[2], [3],[5], using eﬀective coeﬃcients. In [2], [3], based on the ideas of the renormalized group (RG) by Wilson
[4], the subgrid formulas for the eﬀective permeability coeﬃcient were derived,
and the diﬀusion of the interface of liquids in their combined current in a scaleinvariant porous medium for log-normal permeability distributions was studied.
The Landau-Lifshits formula for the eﬀective permeability within a strict ﬁeld RG
was calculated in Teodorovich [5]. In particular, there are mentioned arguments
from monograph [6], according to which the RG methods partially take into account higher orders of the perturbation theory and are to improve the accuracy of
the formulas to be obtained. The same arguments are also applicable to the subgrid modeling. If a medium is assumed to satisfy the improved similarity hypothesis by Kolmogorov [2], [7] the RG equations take a very simple form. In this paper,
the Wilson RG ideas are used for deriving the subgrid modeling formulas when
solving problems of ﬁltration in a multiscale porous medium with a log-stable distribution of permeability. The diﬀerential equations for obtaining eﬀective constants were also derived for the media that do not satisfy the improved similarity
hypothesis. The formulas obtained are veriﬁed by the numerical modeling.

Statement of Problem

For small Reynolds’ numbers, the ﬁltration velocity v and the pressure are connected by the Darcy law v = −ε (x) ∇p, where ε (x) is a random coordinate

function - the permeability coeﬃcient. An incompressible liquid ﬂows through
the medium. The incompressibility condition brings about the equation
∇ [ε (x) ∇p (x)] = 0.

(1)

Let a permeability ﬁeld be known. This means that at each point x, the permeability is measured by pushing the liquid through a pattern of a very small
size l0 A random function of spatial coordinates ε(x) is regarded as permeability
limit at l0 → 0, ε (x)l0 → ε (x). In order to turn to a coarser grid l1 , it is
impossible just to smooth the obtained ﬁeld ε(x)l0 in the scale l1 > l0 . The ﬁeld
obtained is not a true permeability, which describes ﬁltration in the domain of
scales (l1 , L), where L is the largest scale. In order that permeability be deﬁned
on a coarser grid, measurements should be taken again by pushing the liquid
through larger samples of the size l1 . The necessity of fulﬁlling this procedure is
due to the fact that the permeability ﬂuctuations from the limit (l0 , l1 ) have correlations with the pressure ﬂuctuations induced by them. Similar to Kolmogorov
[7], we consider the dimensionless ﬁeld ψ equal to the relation of permeabilities
smoothed in two diﬀerent scales (l, l1 ). This approach is described in detail in
[2]. Let us denote by ε(x)l the smoothed in scale l the permeability ε (x)l0 , then
ψ(x, l, l1 ) = ε(x)l1 /ε(x)l . When l1 → l, the ﬁeld ϕ (x,l) = dψ(x,l,lλ)
|λ=1 is obdλ
tained that deﬁnes all statistical attributes of a porous medium. The relation
obtained represents a diﬀerential equation, whose solution yields the permeability as function of the ﬁeld ϕ

The permeability is assumed to have inhomogeneities of the scales l from the
interval l0 < l < L, and the ﬁeld ϕ is isotropic and homogeneous. The ﬁelds
ϕ(x, l), ϕ(y, l ), with diﬀerent scales for any x, y are statistically independent.
This hypothesis is generally assumed to be correct for diﬀerent models and reﬂects the fact that the statistical dependence attenuates when ﬂuctuations of
scales diﬀer in value [7]. The scale properties of a model are deﬁned from the
ﬁeld ϕ(x, l). For the scale-invariant models, the condition ϕ(x, l) → ϕ(Kx, Kl).
should be fulﬁlled. According to the theorem of sums of independent random
ﬁelds [8] if the variance ϕ(x, l) is ﬁnite, then for large l. Integral in (2) tends
to the ﬁeld with a normal distribution. However, if the variance is inﬁnite and
there exists a non-degenerate, limiting distribution of a sum of random values,
then such a distribution will be stable. For simplicity, the ﬁeld ϕ(x, l) is assumed
1, it is impossible to calculate the
to have a stable distribution. With L/l0
pressure from equation (1) or if it is, then it demands large computer costs.
Therefore, we pose the problem to obtain eﬀective coeﬃcients in equations for
the large-scale ﬁltration components. For the subgrid modeling we use ideas of
the Wilson RG.

A Log-Stable Permeability

The growth of irregularity, chaotic state and intermittence in the behavior of
physical ﬁelds with increasing the scale of measuring made many researchers to
reject the log-normal model and consider a general case of log-stable distributions.
In [9], distributions of permeability ﬁelds and some statistical characteristics
were obtained using the experimental borehole data. Also, it was shown that the
permeability ﬁelds can have log-stable distributions. Stable distributions depend
on the four parameters α, β, µ, σ, [10]. The parameter α is within the domain
0 < α ≤ 2, where α = 2 corresponds to the Gauss distribution. Statistical
moments of order m for m ≥ α do not exist except for the case α = 2, for
which all the statistical moments are determined. Thus, the variance is inﬁnite
for α < 2, and the mean value - for α < 1. For modeling the ﬁeld ϕ(x, l), having
a stable distribution law, the approach from [11] is used. At the points (xj , l),
the ﬁeld ϕ is deﬁned by the sum of random independent values having stable
distributions with the same parameters α, β, µ = 0, σ = 1 (the form A [10])):
ϕ(xj , l) =

where l = 2τ , δτ - is a discretization step, the coeﬃcients alji have a support of size l3 , depend only on the module of diﬀerence of indices ( in the
sequel the index j can be omitted ) alji ≡ al (|i − j|), and for all l the condition

= 1 holds. For 1 ≤ α ≤ 2, the thus constructed ﬁeld

ϕ can be stable, homogeneous and isotropic in spatial variables [11]. If the coand the constants Φ0 (l), ϕ0 (l)
eﬃcients alji satisfy the condition alji ≡ al |i−j|
l
are the same for all l, then the ﬁeld ϕ will be invariant with respect to the scale
transformation. The mean of the ﬁeld ϕ exists and is equal to ϕ0 (l). As for the
second moments, they are inﬁnite for α = 2. This complicates carrying out the
correlation analysis, applied, for example, in [2] and the approach used in [5].
Nevertheless, for an extreme point β = 1 the second moments for the permeability ﬁeld itself exist despite of the absence of variance of the ﬁeld ϕ. This
case is of interest, because it was experimentally veriﬁed [9]. As l0 is a minimum
scale, we can set ε(x) = ε (x)l0 . Thus, the permeability ﬁeld ε(x) within the
above-described model has the form:

where L = 2Lδτ , l0 = 2l0 δτ , and the integral in formula (2) is replaced by the sum.
For the calculation of moments of ﬁrst and second orders we use formulas from

A Subgrid Model

Let us divide the permeability function ε (x) = ε (x)l0 into two components with
respect to the scale l. The large-scale component ε(x, l) is obtained by statistical
averaging over all ϕ(x, l1 ) with l1 < l, while the small-scale component is equal
to: ε (x) = ε(x) − ε(x, l):

where <>< means averaging over ϕ(x, l1 ) from the small scale l1 . The largescale (on-grid) pressure component p(x, l) is obtained as averaged solution to
equation (1), where the large-scale component (1) is ﬁxed, while the small-scale
component ε is random, p(x, l) =< p (x) >< . The subgrid component is equal
to p = p (x)−p(x, l). Let us substitute the expressions for p(x), ε(x) in equation
(1) with averaging over the component ε :
∇ [ε(x,l)∇p(x,l)+ < ε (x)∇p (x) >< ] = 0.

(9)

The second term in equation 9) is unknown, but cannot be rejected without preliminary estimation, since the correlation between permeability and the pressure
gradient can be essential [1], [5]. The choice of the form of the second term in
(9) determines a subgrid model. In order that values of such an expression be
estimated, we apply the perturbation theory. In the Wilson RG, the initial value
of the scale l is close to that of the least scale l. Subtracting (9) from (1) we
obtain the subgrid equation for the pressure p (x):
∇ [ε(x)∇p(x)] − ∇ [ε(x,l)∇p(x, l)+ < ε (x)∇p (x) >< ] = 0.

Equation (10) is used for ﬁnding the pressure p (x) and cannot be accurately
solved. From equation (10), neglecting second order terms of smallness, obtain
∆p (x) = −

(11)

According to the Wilson RG, the values ε (x, l) , p (x, l) from the right-hand side
equation (11) are considered to be known, their derivatives changing slower than
ε (x). This corresponds to the idea to obtain a correct on-grid equation in the
large-scale limit. Therefore,
p (x) =

where D is a spatial dimension, here D = 3. The model is similar to that
mentioned in Landau and Lifshits [13], which is used for eﬀective dielectric permeability of a mixture under simplifying assumptions of small ﬂuctuations of
their spatial scale. From (7), (8) and using formulas [11], keeping only ﬁrst order

(15)

In the subgrid modeling, the eﬀective permeability coeﬃcient in the scale l must
correctly describe the solution to equation (1) within the scales (l, L) and be calculated by a formula of the same form as ε (x)l0 . Thus, the eﬀective permeability
is determined from

Numerical Modeling

Equation (1) is numerically solved in the cube with the edge L0 . On the sides
of the cube y = 0, y = L0 we set the constant pressure p (x, y, z) |y=0 = p1 ,
p (x, y, z) |y=L0 = p2 , p1 > p2 . The pressure on other sides of the cube is set by
the linear dependence along y: p = p1 + (p2 − p1 ) /L0 . . The major ﬁltration
ﬂow is directed along the axis y. Here, dimensionless variables are used. The
problem is solved in the unit cube, with a unit pressure jump and ε0 = 1. The
permeability ﬁeld is simulated by (4), 256 × 256 × 256 grid in spatial variables
is used, the scale step being δτ = 1, τl = 0, . . . , −8.. The coeﬃcients alji were

The ﬁeld ϕ(x, τ ) is generated independent for each τl . The common exponent
in (4) is summed up over statistically independent layers. For an approximate
solution, it is possible to use a certain limited number of layers. We have selected
the number of layers so that the scale of the largest permeability ﬂuctuations
would allow us to approximately change probabilistic mean values averaged over
space and the scale of the smallest ﬂuctuations, so that the diﬀerence problem
will approximate equation (1)suﬃciently well, whose grid analog is solved by
the iterative method. Independent random values ζil in formula (4) were simulated using the algorithm and the program cited [14]. For self-similar media the
constants Φ0 , ϕ0 can be selected from experimental data for natural porous media. According to [12], the exponent in (6) for some natural media varies within
0.25 − 0.3.
Fig. 1 shows the lines of the self-similar permeability level in the mid-span
section z = 1/2 for α = 2, which corresponds to the log-normal permeability
model and α = 1, 6, β = 1, and, respectively, to a stable model. The parameters
Φ0 = 0.3, ϕ0 = 0. A diﬀerence between the two models is distinct.
According to the procedure of deriving a subgrid formula, for its veriﬁcation it
is necessary to numerically solve the full problem and to fulﬁl the probabilistic

compared to a theoretical formula. This paper presents a more eﬃcient version
of such a veriﬁcation that is based on the power dependence of the ﬂow rate
on the ratio of a maximum to a minimum scales in the ongrid domain when
calculating permeability using (4) provided the contribution of a subgrid domain
is not taken into account. The full ﬂow rate of a liquid through a sample should
coincide with the true one independent of the scale of the cut oﬀ l. The following
