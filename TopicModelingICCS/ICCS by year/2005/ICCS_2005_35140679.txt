Abstract. This paper presents a cost-eﬀective private-key cryptosystem
for color images. The scheme allows for secret sharing of the color image
by generating two color shares with dimensions identical to those of the
original. Encryption is performed via simple binary operations realized
at the image bit-levels altering both the spectral correlation among the
RGB color components and the spatial correlation between the neighboring color vectors. The decryption procedure uses both noise-like color
shares as the input and recovers the original image with perfect reconstruction.

Introduction

Image secret sharing techniques [1],[2] represent a popular encryption tool used
to secure transmission of personal digital photographs [3],[4] and digital documents [5] via public communication networks. The so-called {k, n}-threshold
scheme [1],[4]-[9] encrypts the input image by splitting the original content into
n noise-like shares. The secret information is recovered only if k or more shares
are available for decryption [6]-[9].
Among the various {k, n}-threshold schemes, a simple {2, 2} solution, seen as
a private-key cryptosystem [8],[9], takes a great popularity due to its simplicity
and adequate information security. The encryption process splits the secret image
into two noise-like shares which are delivered to the end-user independently. To
recover the actual information the end-user should be in possession of both
shares.
Although numerous secret sharing solutions have been proposed for encryption of binary and gray-scale images [1],[6]-[11], secret sharing of color images
has become increasingly important in recent times. The growing interest in the
development the color image encryption techniques [3]-[5],[12]-[17] can be attributed primarily to the proliferation of color imaging systems and imagingenabled consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras and mobile phones
[18]. End-users and system developers have to protect personal digital photographs and scanned digital documents in emerging applications such as digital
photo archiving and image transmission through wireless (mobile) networks. The

surge of emerging applications and the proliferation of color imaging systems and
imaging-enabled consumer electronic devices suggests that the demand for color
image encryption solutions will continue.

Color Imaging Basics

Let us consider a K1 × K2 Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image x : Z 2 → Z 3 representing a two-dimensional matrix of three-component vectorial inputs. In a
given K1 × K2 RGB color image x, pixel x(p,q) = [x(p,q)1 , x(p,q)2 , x(p,q)3 ] denotes
the color vector occupying the spatial location (p, q), with p = 1, 2, ..., K1 and
q = 1, 2, ..., K2 denoting the image row and column, respectively. The component x(p,q)i , for i = 1, 2, 3, of the RGB vector x(p,q) denotes the vector’s spectral
component, namely: x(p,q)1 denotes the R component, x(p,q)2 denotes the G component, and x(p,q)3 indicates the B component.
Following the tristimulus theory of color representation, each color pixel x(p,q)
is a three-dimensional vector, uniquely deﬁned by its length (magnitude) Mx :
Z 2 → R+ and orientation (direction) Dx : Z 2 → S 2 in the vector space, [18].
The magnitude
Mx(p,q) = x(p,q) =

x2(p,q)1 + x2(p,q)2 + x2(p,q)3

(1)

of the color vector relates to the luminance, whereas the vectors’ directionality
Dx(p,q) =

x(p,q)
x(p,q)

=

x(p,q)
Mx(p,q)

(2)

with S 2 denoting a unit ball in R3 and Dx(p,q) = 1, relates to the chromaticity
characteristics of the pixel.
Since both measures are essential for human perception [19], any color image
encryption solution should alter both the magnitude and the orientation characteristics of the original color vectors. Using secret sharing principles for color
image encryption [3]-[5],[13], the cryptographic solution generates color shares
which contain noise-like, seemingly unrelated information.

Overview of Color Image Secret Sharing Solutions

Popular visual secret sharing (VSS) schemes, such as those proposed in [1],[6]-[9],
allow for visual recovery of the encrypted images [1]. By utilizing the transparent/frosted representation of the shares (usually printed on transparencies) and
color mixing principles, the color VSS schemes such as those listed in [12],[14],[15]
use the properties of the human visual system (HVS) to force the recognition
of a secret message from the required set of shares without additional computations or any knowledge of cryptography [1]. On the other hand, VSS schemes
can also be implemented via simple logical operations and used in a computercentric environment. Although these features make the VSS decryption system

cost-eﬀective, such an approach is not well suited for natural color images. This
is due to the fact that the procedure increases the spatial dimension of both
shares and output image and introduces a number of visual impairments to the
output image (Fig.1b).
The secret sharing schemes of [3]-[5] operate on the bit planes of the digital
input and generate the shares with a bit representation identical to the one of the
input image. Although the input image and the produced shares have diﬀerent
spatial dimensions due to encryption of each pixel into the blocks of share pixels,
the decryption procedure produces an output image (Fig.1c) which is identical
to the input (Fig.1a). It was explained in [13] that such a cryptographic solution
satisﬁes the so-called perfect reconstruction property. Since both bit-level processing based {k, n}-solutions [3]-[5], and {2, 2} private key cryptosystem of [13]
increase the dimensions of the shares compared to those of the original (secret)
image, the produced shares with the enlarged spatial resolution may become
diﬃcult to transmit via wireless mobile networks.

Private-Key Cryptosystem for Color Image Encryption

To avoid this drawback, our new private-key cryptosystem for color image encryption reduces the block-based share operations to the pixel-based operations
[16]. Thus, the spatial resolution of the shares remain unchanged during processing. Moreover, since the scheme performs cryptographic processing on bit planes,
it: i) preserves the bit-representation of the shares, and ii) produces an output
image identical to the input image. This suggests that the scheme recovers the
input image with perfect reconstruction.
Assuming the conventional RGB color image, each color component x(p,q)k
of the color vector x(p,q) is coded with B = 8 bits allowing x(p,q)k to take an

integer value between 0 and 2B − 1. Using a bit-level representation [13], the
color vector x(p,q) can be equivalently expressed in a binary form as follows:

where xb(p,q) = [xb(p,q)1 , xb(p,q)2 , xb(p,q)3 ] ∈ {0, 1}3 denotes the binary vector at the
b-bit level, with b = 1 denoting the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB).
Since the proposed private-key cryptosystem is a simple {2, 2}−secret sharing
scheme, binary vectors xb(p,q) , for b = 1, 2, ..., B, are encrypted into two binary

where the binary set [s(p,q)k

By repeating the process at each binary level b = 1, 2, ..., B and each vector component k = 1, 2, 3, the procedure generates two color share vectors
s (p,q) = [s(p,q)1 , s(p,q)2 , s(p,q)3 ] and s (p,q) = [s(p,q)1 , s(p,q)2 , s(p,q)3 ] deﬁned as

binary share vectors s(p,q)
By performing the processing operations (3)-(5) in each spatial location (p, q),
for p = 1, 2, ..., K1 and q = 1, 2, ..., K2 , the procedure produces two K1 × K2
color shares s : Z 2 → Z 3 and s : Z 2 → Z 3 , with the share vectors s (p,q) and
s (p,q) denoting the color pixels located at (p, q) in s and s , respectively. This
increases protection of both the individual color channels (2B levels) and the
color shares (23B possible color vectors) depicted in Figs.3b,c since the random
b
b
and s(p,q)
are weighted by 2B−b needed in the determination
binary vectors s(p,q)
of the word-level color image model.
It is shown in [16] that due to the randomness in the encryption process deﬁned in (4) the color share vectors s (p,q) and s (p,q) diﬀer both in magnitude
(Ms (p,q) = Ms (p,q) ) and in direction (Ds (p,q) = Ds (p,q) ). In addition, they diﬀer
in both magnitude and direction from those (Mx(p,q) , Dx(p,q) ) observed for the
original color inputs x(p,q) . As it can be seen in Fig.3 the encryption process
changes the spectral correlation characteristics of the input vectors and alters
the spatial correlation characteristics of the input image. The utilization of the
complete RGB color gamut (2563 = 16, 777, 216 colors) in the proposed encryption procedure i) ensures adequate protection against attacks in the color share
domain, and ii) prohibits unauthorized access to the original bit information.
To faithfully decrypt the secret color image from the color shares, the decryption function must satisfy the perfect reconstruction property. This can be
obtained when the encryption and decryption operations are reciprocal [13].
Therefore, the original color/structural information is recovered by processing
the share vector arrays at the binary level, and the decryption function follows
the encryption mechanism in (4) resulting in the following deﬁnition [16]:
xb(p,q)k =

b
b
0 if s(p,q)k
= s(p,q)k
b

1 if s(p,q)k = s(p,q)k

(6)

Based on the reciprocal concept between (4) and (6), the original binary
component xb(p,q)k is recover as xb(p,q)k = 1 if the binary share components

xb(p,q) = [xb(p,q)1 , xb(p,q)2 , xb(p,q)3 ] the binary vector xb(p,q) is formed. Application of
(3) results in the recovered original color vector x(p,q) , which suggests that the
proposed method satisﬁes the perfect reconstruction property.
Figs.3b,c show the color shares obtained when the cryptographic operations
are applied to all bit planes (b = 1, 2, ..., B). The complexity of the solution can
be reduced by performing the encryption/decryption operations for a reduced set
of bit planes. Visual inspection of the color shares depicted in Fig.4 reveals that
the encryption of the MSB (Figs.4a,d) or the two most signiﬁcant bits (Figs.4b,e)
only, ﬁne details are suﬃciently encrypted, however, large ﬂat regions can be
visually revealed. The results depicted in Figs.4c,f indicate that a suﬃcient level
of protection is achieved by cryptographically processing the ﬁrst three most
signiﬁcant bits (b = 1, 2, 3). The remaining bits of the original image vectors
can be simply copied into the shares unchanged. If this option is selected, image
decryption has to be performed only for b = 1, 2, 3.

Conclusion

A private-key cryptosystem for color image encryption was presented. The solution can be seen a {2, 2}-secret sharing scheme which satisﬁes the perfect
reconstruction property. By applying simple logical cryptographic operations
at the bit-level, the encryption procedure: i) changes both the magnitude and
the orientation of the color vectors generating color noise-like shares, and ii) it
produces random-like color vectors which diﬀer signiﬁcantly in both magnitude
and orientation from the original color inputs. Thus, the generated shares which
can be transmitted over unsecured public channels with reasonable overhead.
Since the method performs the pixel-based share operations instead of the usual
block-based operations, the produced color hares have the same spatial resolution as the original image. The input color image is perfectly reconstructed from
the share vector arrays using elementary bit-level logical functions. The perfect
reconstruction allowed by the procedure makes it ideal for cost-eﬀective dissemination of digital imaging material over untrusted communication channels.
