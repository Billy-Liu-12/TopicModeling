Abstract
The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) has been established by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the
Directorate General for Environment (DG ENV) of the European Commission (EC) in close collaboration with the Member
States and neighbour countries. EFFIS is intended as complementary system to national and regional systems in the countries,
providing harmonised information required for international collaboration on forest ﬁre prevention and ﬁghting and in cases
of trans-boundary ﬁre events. However, one missing component in the system is a wildﬁre behaviour model able to cover the
whole Europe. We propose a new general conceptualisation for wildﬁre prediction. It relies on an array-based and semantically
enhanced (Semantic Array Programming) application of the Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) concept,
so as to predict spread of large ﬁres at European level. The proposed mathematical framework is designed to simulate with
an ensemble strategy the wildﬁre dynamics under given sequences of actions for controlling the ﬁre spread and updated datadriven information. First results on data and software uncertainties associated with the problem have been presented with a
real case study in Spain.

1. Introduction
European landscapes and their ecosystem dynamics are aﬀected by many disturbances [1–4]. Among them,
ﬁres play a key role [5, 6] especially in the Mediterranean region [7, 8]. Uncontrolled ﬁres may cause signiﬁcant
economical and environmental damage. Every year in Europe around half a million hectares of wildland and
forest areas are burnt as a consequence of approximately 65000 ﬁres – with over 85% of the burnt area occurring
in the European Mediterranean region [9].
1.1. Integrating wildﬁres in a wider context
Besides being potentially dangerous for human life (and health [10]), ﬁres alter [11–13] habitat connectivity
and fragmentation [14–16] aﬀecting biodiversity of wild animals and forest plants [17, 18]. Burnt areas are exposed [19] to soil erosion [20, 21] whose in-site eﬀects might also be complemented by oﬀ-site impacts [22–24]

(e.g. increased sediments in downstream rivers, also inﬂuencing water resources quality [25, 26] and water storage
losses). The involved land cover degradation may aﬀect the precipitation-runoﬀ relationship [27], especially in
mountainous areas. This might have a role in exacerbating moderate ﬂoods [28] if not even major ones [29]. At the
same time, climate change [30] and pest outbreaks may aﬀect the way in which vegetation reacts to ﬁres (e.g. in
case of wide die-oﬀs and subsequent high share of dead trees) [31]. It is therefore evident that properly addressing
wildﬁre management also involves the analysis of several coupled ecosystem services [32] in the wider context
of integrated natural resources modelling and management (INRMM) [33]. Here a multi-criteria mathematical
framework (eq. 5–6) is discussed for better addressing this variety of impacts which might otherwise be oversimpliﬁed within uni-dimensional approaches (e.g. cost-beneﬁt analysis) [34, 32]. On the other hand, this proposal of
mathematical modelling structure is intended to be ﬂexible enough to be applicable in emergency situations where
information is frequently lacking. Depending on the local conditions of applicability, this conceptual framework
aims to contribute to wildﬁre management with adaptive support, ranging from data driven simulations of ﬁre
dynamics’ scenarios up to possible proactive support in selecting eﬃcient management options.
1.2. Interactions between ﬁre events prediction and management
Timing and strategy are most important for eﬀectively handling the situation during a ﬁre event. For a long
time [35], computational modelling has supported the analysis of wildﬁres’ dynamics [36]. Time plays a critical
role (section 3) even in the conceptualisation of this modelling problem (from the time interval U t = [tstart , tend ] of
the ﬁre event – where tend is unknown, ranging from hours to weeks after tstart ). While the complete mathematical
framework will be presented in section 4, the relationship between ﬁre events prediction and management is
discussed here because of its multifaceted nature situated at the science-policy interface [37] which deserves
speciﬁc attention. Since the simulated dynamic of an uncontrolled wildﬁre in many cases completely diﬀers from
a real one, predicting wildﬁre behaviour necessarily implies modelling the anthropogenic control (e.g. ﬁrebreaks,
wetting, ﬁre retardation and fuel reduction: here denoted as the set U u of controls u) applied to contain the ﬁre
evolution (eq. 2). The complete sequence of actions for controlling the ﬁre spread ut , ut+Δt , · · · along a ﬁre event
may be described as an instantiation for that speciﬁc ﬁre and conditions of a general ﬁre management policy u(·)
which reacts to (as a function of) the actual wildﬁre state x:
ut , ut+Δt , · · ·

such that

∀τ ∈ U t , uτ = u (xτ )

(1)

This management policy is generally subjected to procedures, legal obligations and constraints which may
diﬀer from country to country, with varying degrees of freedom in the spatio-temporal allocation of the possible
controls. A wide scale approach over heterogeneous spatial domains as those in Europe needs to consider this fact
explicitly. This suggests a ﬂexible, lightweight approach and thus to avoid embedding those aspects as monolithic
parameterisation within the mathematical description. Instead, our proposal preserves the generality by focusing
on the structural and semantic form of the problem (including the aforementioned constraints, see section 4) and
on explicit awareness about some key sources of uncertainty (sections 5–6).
The information on the anthropogenic control may be used in two ways.
1.2.1. Simulating with external control scenarios First, it can serve as a required input for a realistic prediction
of the wildﬁre dynamics. In this case, the ﬁre controls are decided elsewhere and notiﬁed to the predictive model.
This may be exploited by simulating the eﬀects of the particular data series constituted by a planned sequence of
controls Utt, tend = {utt , utt+Δt , · · · } ∈ Utu, tend entirely known in advance (i.e. decided or hypothesised as a scenario)
at time t ∈ U t . The information may also be updated periodically so as to simulate the ﬁre evolution with a
t+Δt
timely revised control strategy Ut+Δt
, tend which could adapt the foreseen management to changing conditions (e.g.
weather). An a posteriori analysis of the ﬁre management history is also possible by simulating the past ﬁre
dynamics once the ﬁre event is concluded. This would require the actually implemented sequence of controls

1.2.2. Supporting the generation of control strategies Second, the feasible alternative options Utu, tend for managing the ﬁre at a given time t might be used for simulating their corresponding eﬀects within the model and
deriving possible (sub-)optimal strategies according to assessment criteria (whose choice is never a technical detail but instead a policy-making decision [37]). As in the ﬁrst approach, in itinere changing conditions during
the ﬁre event may suggest iterative re-optimisation for updating the suggested control strategy and dynamically
supporting the ﬁreﬁghting and emergency operations. In a wider temporal scale, such a modelling approach might
be exploited in advance for simulating possible future ﬁres and contributing to a better spatial allocation of ﬁre
crews and equipment. This second way of addressing control strategies may clearly be set in the context of a
decision support system. Here, approximate or heuristic optimisation strategies may be essential.
Although the European countries have collected information on forest ﬁres since 1970s, the lack of harmonised
information at the European Union (EU) level has prevented a holistic INRMM approach for forest ﬁre prevention in the Region. The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) [9] has been developed jointly by
the European Commission (EC) services (Directorate General Environment and the Joint Research Centre) and
the relevant ﬁres services in the countries (forest ﬁres and civil protection services) in response to the needs of
European bodies such as the Monitoring and Information Centre of Civil Protection, the European Commission
Services and the European Parliament. However, one missing component in the system is a wildﬁre behaviour
modelling architecture able to systematically cover the whole spatial extent of Europe. Our contribution aims
at proposing a conceptualisation based on a semantically-enhanced application of the concept of Dynamic Data
Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) [38]. Along with the mathematical modelling framework, ﬁrst results on
the data and software uncertainty [39] associated with the problem are presented with a case study.
2. The European Forest Fire Information System
EFFIS is a comprehensive system covering the full cycle of forest ﬁre management; from forest ﬁre prevention
and preparedness to post-ﬁre damage analysis. The system provides information to over 30 countries in the
European and Mediterranean regions and receives detailed information on forest ﬁre events from 22 European
countries, supporting their prevention and ﬁghting in Europe [9].
Exploratory research is currently on-going to integrate ﬁre behaviour models, with emphasis on extreme conditions, physical modelling, smoke dispersion and spotting from forest ﬁres. Also, existing models to assess ﬁre
behaviour and adaptation for EU are under investigation. Another aspect relates the use of high resolution meteorological data from organisations such as ENCWF [40] and Meteo France [41] which may help to localize
information, also improving the ﬁre behaviour prediction.
EFFIS is part of the European Forest Data Centre [42] which widely exploits geospatial and computational
modelling tools [43] within a modelling paradigm aiming at robustness and semantic transparency [39, 37].
2.1. Detecting large forest ﬁres from satellite images
FireNews EFFIS module is a web based application integrated within the EFFIS portal as a toolset which
provides automatic geoparsing and simpliﬁes the management of the ﬁre news collected by the operator [44]. The
satellite images used for detecting burnt areas are the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
by NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. These images are updated daily and have a pixel size of 250m. To ensure
higher reliability, the procedure is only partially automated, with a key role for expert judgement:
1. Hot Spots from NASA are loaded and visualised in the workspace of the desktop GIS as a layer of points.
2. Fire News events are visualised in the same workspace as a layer of points.
3. The MODIS images are analysed near the hot spots/ﬁre-news, which may be aﬀected by a certain shift from
the actual ﬁre. In general such a shift has a spatial error within 1 km. In order for a ﬁre to be detected,
comparing at least two MODIS images is essential (before and after the ﬁre) – although normally images
corresponding to several days are compared. The burnt area is detectable as a dark spot not present before
the ﬁre. A detection problem may arise in cloudy days, when the images are not usable.
4. Once a ﬁre is detected, it is digitised by generating a polygon which is stored in the database. If the ﬁre is
still active the day after, the polygon is updated with the new perimeter. The record of a ﬁre stores all the
perimeters day by day, so as to enable the use of such data for future needs and research purposes.

3. Static versus dynamic parameterisation of ﬁre models
Traditionally, forest ﬁre models embrace three broad factors, called by some scientists the ﬁre environment
triangle, which are fuel, meteorology and topography [45]. However, assuming those conditions to be stable
and permanent within a given ﬁre lifespan would easily lead simulation results to diverge from the actual ﬁre
behaviour. To mitigate this modelling phenomenon, time has been proposed as an explicit variable inside ﬁre
models, converting the triangle into the square of ﬁre factors [46, 47]. “Classic” (open-loop) prediction methods
may read all environment variables at the time tstart populating with them the model parameters and generating a
ﬁre propagation map in U t . Should any updated data be available within U t , they would often quickly outperform
the increasingly outdated information provided by the initial data [46].
A data driven feedback approach would instead need a system capable of obtaining or estimating (e.g. by
means of speciﬁc data transformation models, D-TM [48, 43, 39], see also table 1) the updated values of input
parameters for the involved simulator. The system should adapt itself dynamically to the constant change of conditions associated with real-time measurements. As detailed in section 4, such characteristics recall the deﬁnition
of DDDAS, which ”is a paradigm whereby application/simulations and measurements become a symbiotic feedback control system. DDDAS entails the ability to dynamically incorporate additional data into an executing
application, and in reverse, the ability of an application to dynamically steer the measurement process” [49].
Methods reducing the negative eﬀect of uncertainty in input parameters, so turning the classic prediction into
DDDAS, complement each predictive step with an associated calibration phase – where information on the ﬁre
system evolution is considered. Data-driven methods are based on very simple conceptual principles: knowledge
and adaptability. Knowledge here focuses on two aspects. First, measuring/reconstructing the conditions where
the ﬁre develops in real-time (wind speed and direction, fuel moisture, terrain slope, ...). Second, observing the
actual ﬁre’s dynamics (the evolving ﬁre geometry). Adaptability is here obtained by modifying the simulator
behaviour (parameterisation, inputs) following data driven changes which may occur in environmental conditions.
4. Modelling methodology: DDDAS for uncertain and semantically enhanced problems
Within the DDDAS approach, computational models are explicitly designed so as to preserve the ability to
incorporate data-driven information not only at the stage of modelling static design, training and tuning but also
dynamically, along the whole life-cycle of the models. At the same time, DDDAS models may dynamically
guide/support the selection of useful new information.
The idea of adapting the way in which a dynamic system is managed by using the best available updated (e.g.
real-time) information is at the basis of several dynamic/adaptive control strategies [51–53]. Some of them are also
able to provide an explicit conceptual framework for incorporating varying uncertainties related (among others)
to data-driven information. Environmental systems are routinely aﬀected by disturbances whose variability may
depend nonlinearly on complex patterns of conditions within and outside the system’s spatial extent. A typical
example is constituted by local meteorological information (future forecasting) which – depending on the required
time scale – is generally inﬂuenced by regional (short-term) or global (mid-term) climatic conditions as well as
by seasonal and interannual variations (long-term).
Natural resources management often relies on adaptive control [54]. For example, stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is widespread in water resources management as a modelling tool for generating optimal seasonal allocation of water reservoirs (such as dams or lakes) [55]. Due to the increased complexity of forest
resources management, a growing amount of SDP applications may be found, particularly in relation to ﬁre risk
management [56–58]. However, SDP is aﬀected by the well known curse of dimensionality (the computational
resources exponentially grow with the number of state variables) where accurate description of nontrivial systems
increases the required dimensionality of the state vector x. Various general strategies [52–53] have been applied
in natural resources applications for mitigating the intractability of complex problems, by approximating the SDP
with modiﬁed algorithms [60–62].
The ﬁre event dynamics may be conceptualised as the D-TM evolution of the state x of the system (the probability for each spatial cell to be a burnt area) in the discrete time interval Δt with respect to the disturbances ξt+Δt
(the spatial ﬁeld of wind speeds and directions, humidity, rainfall, ...), the anthropogenic control ut and the system
characteristics (slope, aspect, fuel distribution, parameterised as θt ):

which enables modular modelling of legal obligations by just redeﬁning Utu (·). The D-TM module f (·) is subject
to the semantic checks sem as pre-, post-conditions and invariants on inputs, outputs and the D-TM itself [63, 39]:

⇔

(4)

The modal/deontic logic operator sem means: “it ought to be that sem”, where sem is a set of valid arraybased semantic constraints (within the semantic array programming paradigm [48, 64], e.g. sections 5.3 and 6).
The notation for time refers to the instant in which a given quantity will be known without uncertainty. The
τ
may be described in terms of a pdf φ( · | Iτ ) – generally a function of the state and control
disturbance vector ξt+Δt
at time t, also dependent from the available data-driven information Iτ . This notation expresses the uncertainty
associated with the disturbances forecast. Depending on the typology of information and on the time τ in which
the information is available, the uncertainty of the predicted disturbances will typically be highly variable.
As anticipated in section 1.2, the deﬁnition of the anthropogenic controls may be provided as external input.
In this case, the evolution of the system can only be simulated with eq. 2. As an alternative, control sequences
could be generated from the feasible alternative options Utu, tend . This way, the system may be used for supporting
the decision-making, either in real-time or as oﬀ-line assessment. The control problem in this case implements a
Partial Open Loop Feedback Control (POLFC) approach [62] for minimising the overall costs associated with the
ﬁre event, from the time t ∈ U t onwards:

5. State transition function
As a case study, the software uncertainty [37, 39] associated with the state transition function (eq. 2) has been
investigated by means of an ensemble approach relying on two particular simulators. It should be underlined that
the proposed method is general and applicable to other simulators. As is well known, the performance of ensemble
approaches tends to increase with a larger number of models (here, ﬁre spread simulators).
5.1. FireSim
The ﬁrst selected simulator is FireSim, proposed by Colins D. Bevins, which implements the library FireLib
[50]. This simulator uses a cell-based approach, the relationship between neighbours being used to evaluate
whether and when the ﬁre may reach a given cell.
FireSim is a deterministic parametric and discrete event type simulator, implemented as a cellular-automata
simulator. It uses the FireLib library which composes the processing as a pipeline structure of four stages (see
ﬁgure 1(a) ). The model implemented in the kernel of FireLib is the one of Rothermel [65].
The structure of the FireSim simulator is shown in ﬁgure 1(a). The main loop operates using a contagion algorithm applied to the 8 neighbours of each cell. For each burnt cell, the algorithm analyses the eight neighbouring
cells and determines their ignition times, as long as conditions (humidity, wind, etc.) allow the ﬁre to reach them.

5.2. GRASS GIS
The second selected simulator is implemented in GRASS GIS [67], a Geographic Information System (GIS)
available as free and open source software (FOSS) for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing,
graphics/maps production, spatial modelling and visualisation. The complete control over implemented functions
and the possibility to customise them to ﬁt the user’s requirements are among the advantages of FOSS. A simulator
based on the least cost path algorithm and simulating elliptically anisotropic spread is implemented in the function
r.spread [68], which takes as input the rate of spread (ROS) generated by the function r.ros [69]. This latter
computes the ROS following the Rothermel model [65] and is based on the Fortran code by [70]. The direction
of the maximum ROS is the vector sum of the forward ROS in wind direction and that in upslope direction. The
obtained raster map layers serve as inputs for r.spread.
Further pre-processing D-TMs were created for providing r.spread and r.ros with the needed inputs (ﬁg. 1(b) ):

The fuel model map (see section 6)
Moisture: 1, 10 and 100 hour fuel models are required by the model. When only one of them is provided,
the others can be estimated by the model [69]. The Rothermel’s model has been developed for local scale
(i.e. with accurate information on the vegetation and moisture). Applying the model at the European scale
implies a certain degree of oversimpliﬁcation. We assume live moisture is 0 because we refer to the dry
season, and the 1 hour fuel model is obtained from the DMC index. DMC (Duﬀ Moisture Code) is an index
that describes the relationship between temperature, relative humidity and rain.
• Wind ﬁeld: the model takes as input the midﬂame wind speed and the direction in the GRASS convention
(degrees from East counterclockwise). We have wind data from ENCWF Ensemble Prediction System [40],
measured every 12 hours and projected every 3 hours on a grid of 25 x 25 km (grib ﬁle). The direction of the
wind is expressed in degrees clockwise from North (direction the wind is blowing from). This is converted
by a script to the GRASS convention. The speed refers to 10-meters WMO Standard, which is converted
to 20-ft wind dividing by 1.15 according to [72]. The mid-ﬂame wind speed is estimated with the Wind
Adjustment Factor (WAF) [70]. See table 1.

The simulation is carried out varying the wind ﬁeld every 3 hours. For each stage, the burnt area resulting
from the simulation is taken as input for the next step. For testing purpose, we simulated the ﬁre spread on case
studies stored in the EFFIS database, in which the burnt perimeter was available in an interval of 24 hours. After
a 24h simulation, we compared the actual burnt perimeter with the result of the simulation.
5.3. Semantic constraints
The two implementations (instances) of the state transition function (eq. 2) work as semantically-enhanced
modules within the overall mathematical modelling structure. Despite the diﬀerences in the local structure and
interface of the two instances, they have been wrapped around so as to present the same module semantics sem
(eq. 2–4: a few more obvious constraints are exempliﬁed in the next section as active links ::constraint::).

6. Data and software uncertainty analysis: a case study in Valencia, Spain
The two instances of the state transition function (eq. 2) are deterministic. Within each run, the state xt, c of
a given cell c at time t is converted to be a ::binary:: ﬂag recording whether c is burnt. The instances originally
assign a proxy value κt, c to each cell; being either the time τ ≤ t in which the ﬁre reached it or otherwise
an IEEE 754 not-a-number value [73, 74]: in this case, the conversion is the GNU Octave/
e MATLAB codelet
xt, c = ∼isnan(κ
κt, c ). Ensembling multiple runs of the instances allows an uncertainty analysis to be performed
for diﬀerent
ﬀ
scenarios (ensemble inputs might be more general: valid runs are expected to provide ::probability::
values ∈ [0, 1]). The weighted-quantile analysis of the ensemble requires all output ::matrix:: layers to have the
::same size:: for generating a ::sortable:: 3-dimensional array ::3-array:: – this is why the conversion from
κt, c to xt, c is needed. Here two scenarios are compared (ﬁg. 2) for a case study. The ﬁrst scenario assumes the
initial wind information to be static along the whole simulation runs (persistent wind forecast, ﬁg. 2 (c) ), while the
second simulates a perfect dynamic wind forecast (ﬁg. 2 (d) ) by exploiting the observed wind information ξt+Δt
(unknown at time t) instead of the one which could have been predicted with the help of real forecast systems.

The study area is located in Dos Aguas, in the south western region nearby Valencia, the third largest city
of Spain. The event is a major forest ﬁre which occurred in 2012, from the 30th of June and the 4th of July.
This was the worst ﬁre in a decade aﬀecting the region, since Valencia started a very eﬃcient ﬁre management
programme following the wide ﬁre impacts which aﬀected the Spanish territory in 1994. The ﬁre in Dos Aguas
destroyed 32,424 hectares of forest, aﬀecting sclerophyllous vegetation (73%) and agriculture (15%). Moreover,
two thousand people were evacuated from their home places and large smoke plumes aﬀected the city of Valencia,
as widely reported by the press.
For each wind-forecast scenario (persistent and perfect), a simple unweighted ensemble of 8 runs is shown
in ﬁg. 2. The 8 runs correspond to the combinations of two simulators (software uncertainty, with diﬀerences
in the predicted ﬁre surface sometime exceeding 10%) running with two possible fuel maps (static parameters’
uncertainty) and two diﬀerent wind sources (dynamic data uncertainty). The fuel maps implement possible reclassiﬁcations of the Corine Land Cover [66]. The selected wind sources are the two closest to the ﬁre [40].
The initial and ﬁnal ﬁre perimeters refer to the digitised polygons associated with the 2nd and 3rd of July
2012, delimiting a simulation of 24 hours. The Corine Land Cover classes present in the study area have been
reclassiﬁed according to [75]. Since the uncertainty with which some of the Corine categories may be remapped
0 , tend
in fuel models, two possible fuel maps (f1b and f2b, table 2) have been generated. The control strategy Utalt
begin , tend

, tend
implemented within the runs does not consider the (unknown) sequence Uthist
which was actually applied durbegin , tend
ing the ﬁre event. Instead, a simple protection strategy has been implemented, in which an intense ﬁre protection
eﬀort has been limited to urbanised and high-value (e.g. fruit/olive trees, vineyards) agriculture areas. Following
this simplistic assumption, those areas have been considered as barriers.

7. Conclusions
Holistic approaches in forest ﬁre prevention at the European scale are increasingly needed. We propose a
new general conceptualisation for wildﬁre prediction [47]. It relies on an array-based and semantically enhanced
(semantic array programming) [48, 64] application of the dynamic data driven application systems [38, 49]. Along
with the mathematical modelling framework, ﬁrst results on data and software uncertainties [37, 39] associated
with the problem have been presented with a real case study in Spain.
The proposed mathematical framework is designed to simulate with an ensemble strategy the wildﬁre dynamics under given sequences of actions for controlling the ﬁre spread. Those sequences might be externally
provided or generated by means of a partial open loop feedback control [62] strategy for supporting the involved
decision-making process. In both cases, the modelling architecture explicitly beneﬁts from dynamic data-driven
information for adaptively improving its robustness. In particular, data and software uncertainty is proactively
exploited in an array oriented framework based on the multiplicity of static parameterisations, dynamic data and
software components. The resulting array of data-transformation models is analysed with an ensemble approach.
The proposal and scientiﬁc investigation are in a preliminary stage. Nonetheless, the ﬁrst analysis for assessing
the data and software uncertainty highlighted the complementary diﬀerences in two implementations based on the
classic Rothermel model [65]. This would suggest the need to further assess the relevance of software uncertainty
with models of the same family (e.g. [76]) or others. The diversity of quasi-static system descriptions (fuel
mapping) and dynamic data forecast (weather) may deserve future investigation as well.
