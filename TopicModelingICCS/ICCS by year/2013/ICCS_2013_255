Abstract

The present work attempts to assess and evaluate the performance of some new DFT methods in describing
van der Waals (vdW) complexes that are characterized by the dominance of pure dispersion interactions. To
achieve this goal, Argon dimers (Ar2) and trimers (Ar3) were investigated. As a reference calculation, the
correlation interaction energy have been computed at the CCSD(T) level using the aug-correlated family of
basis sets pVXZ (where X=2,3,4). Extrapolation to the CBS limit has been carried out and the behavior of the
potential energy function has been analyzed and discussed. Correlation interaction energy has been computed at
the MP2 and MP4 levels and compared to those calculated at the CCSD(T) method. Five new correlated DFT
functionals, namely M06 and its long rang extension M06L, the B97-2 and its modified version B97-D which
was deviseded for the dispersion interaction, and the PBEPBE and its correlated extension PBE0 methods have
been used to compute the interaction energy in Ar2 and Ar3. The present work results indicate clearly that M06
and M06L did not only overestimate the equilibrium distance and depth but they also showed fluctuations in
the potential energy curve near the minimum and along the dissociative arm. The B97-D and the PBE0
methods are much more reliable. However, these two later methods showed convergence problems when used
to treat Ar3+; in addition to being extremely fast when compared to the CCSD(T) method extremely fast as
compared to the CCSD(T). These features make them good candidate for investigating large vdW clusters. The
BSSE has been estimated, analyzed and discussed. The relative stabilities of the excited states of Ar2 and Ar3
clusters together with those of the ionic species (Ar2+ and Ar3+)have been computed and analyzed.

some new correlated DFT methods in reproducing cluster pure dispersion van der Waals interactions . These
clusters are of great interest because the underlying type of interactions playkey roles in molecular recognition
[1] protein folding [2] stacking of DNA bases [3] and intercalation of drugs into DNA [4]. Although nonbonded interactions have been studied extensively both experimentally [5] and theoretically [6] the features of
the potential energy surface (PES) and the nature of these interactions are still far from being completely
understood. The difficulties arise from the relative weakness of the interaction and the shallowness of PES.
Because argon and aromatic hydrocarbon clusters lack permanent dipole moments, the major part of the
binding force comes from the dispersion interactions, which require expensive calculations at a correlated level
of theory.
Dispersion interactions are either isotropic, as in the case of rare-gases, or anisotropic in nature, as in the case
of HF, CO, and methane. Theoretical efforts concentrate on rare gas interactions
because their results can be compared with experiments to evaluate the level of theoretical model employed.
Thereafter the appropriate theoretical model can be extended to molecules.
The literature contains several theoretical calculations along these lines [7-12]. However, the need for tailoring
the appropriate method to evaluate vdW interactions, still exists. The difficulty of resolving this issue lies
inthree main reasons that emanate from the size and flexibility of the basis set, the inclusion of electroncorrelation and the minimization of basis set superposition error. Thus, their extension to relatively large
molecular systems, similar to the one studied in this laboratory, is governed by basis set limitations at the
expense of computational demands.
.
In most casesclusters are not expected to reside in their ground state only. Being highly energetic, clusters also
exist in excited states or as ionized species. Thus, in the present work, the potential energy surface for Ar 2 and
Ar3 clusters will be fully explored at high level of theory. The stability of low-lying singlet and triplet states of
Ar2 and Ar3 clusters will be investigated and the corresponding PES will be explored. The Ar 2+ and Ar3+ ions
will also be investigated and their binding energies will be computed at high level of theory. Computational
challenge such as, basis set effect, and basis set superposition error will be addressed.
The ultimate aim of the present work is, thus, to establish an acceptable level of computation for predicting the
behavior of vdW complexes. A level of theory that is able of picking up appreciable amount of correlation
interaction energy, reproducing the equilibrium separation within the acceptable limits and at the same time
being cost and time effective.

Computational methods

Ab intio calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09W program [13]. The coupled cluster method with
singles, doubles, and noniterative triples [CCSD(T)] has been used throughout this work.The aug-cc-pVXZ
basis sets (where X=2,3,and4) have been applied. Extrapolation to the basis set limit (CBS) has been carried
out using the extrapolation formula:

E(x) = ECBS + a e-(x-1) + be-(x-1)2
where, ECBS is the energy at the complete basis set limit, x is the zeta exponent and a, b are arbitrary constants.
This formula has been reported to give reliable and accurate results in a comprehensive study published
recently by Feller et al [14]. BSSE was estimated by the function counterpoise method Proposed by Boys and
Bernadi [15]. Five DFT methods [16-21] has been tested and evaluated in this work namely, M06, M06l [2226] B97-D[27], and PBEPBE and its correlated extension PBE0 methods[28].

3.1.Computational methods and Basis set
Figure 1 depictss the potential energy surface for the Ar2 dimer which was computed by using the CCSD(T)
method at aug-cc-pVXZ (where X=2,3,4), CBS, 6-31++G** and 6-311++G** basis sets. For comparison,
Figure 1(b) ashows the PES for Ar2 trimer which was computed by using the CCSD(T) at different basis sets. It
is clear that the vdW interaction of pure isotropic nature is very well accounted for. All basis sets investigated
were able to describe,almost equally, t the dissociative arm of the PES. However, the well depth and the
internuclear distance (Re) were much more sensitive to the basis set quality. In general, Re and well depth
values tend to shift to shorter values as the zeta exponent of the aug-basis set increases. The results obtained
with the Gaussian type function 6-31++G** were of slightly lower quality as compared to th of the aug-ccpVDZ basis set. However, increasing the spatial extent of the Gaussian basis set by an extra d and f functions
led to marked improvement in the predicted potential energy curve, yet this happened at the expense of
tremendous increase in computational time. The aug-cc-pVTZ predicted a PES that is of comparable quality as
that obtained at the basis set limit (CBS).

curves by using different levels of theory. Our computation was able to pick up about 96% of the correlation
interaction energy at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Apparently, this has not been improved by
basis set extrapolation to the CBS limit. The computed Re value is comparable to the experimental and best
benchmark value of 3.75 Å [29]. Meanwhile, the GT basis set (6-31++G**) was unable to pick up more than
58% of the well depth and it predicted a far too long Re value. Improving its extension in space and its diffusion
tendency have led to real improvements in its efficiency. As a result it picked up c.a. 91% of the well depth and
the Re value was . Table 2 depicts Ar3 characteristic quantities which were computed at the same chemistry
level.. The present computation showed clearly that the triangular Ar3 is more stable than its linear
counterpart. It is interesting to note that the equilibrium distance for linear Ar3 is the same as that for Ar2 but
slightly longer than that for triangular Ar3. The Ar3 cluster well depths showed the same trend in line with
basis set quality. This is exactly similar to that reported for the Ar2 case. The well depth at the CBS limit of
285.866 cm-1 was of very good quality. The 6-31++G** basis set was able to recover up to 79% of the total
correlation interaction energy. Furthermore, this basis set tends always to exaggerate well-positions.

It seems instructive to compare the behaviour of CCSD(T) method with those of the much less expensive MPx
methods. Table 3 lists the potential energy surface characteristics of Ar2 which were computed at the
MP2,MP4 and M06 methods at different basis sets. The augmented correlated basis functions were used in all
these calculations. Initially it is worth mentioning that the potential energy curves, in and around the
minimum, were extremely shollwo, to the extent that they were almost being flat. This was true for all tested
basis sets and particularly correct for both the MP2 and MP4 levels. Inspection of Table 3 reveals that the
MP2/aug-cc-pVXZ (where X=3,4) levels reproduced remarkably the experimental Re value. . However, their
well depths were not as satisfactory as those of the CCDS(T) method using the same basis sets. This was also
true for calculations using the other aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets. The well depths were much more sensitive to the
method of computing the correlation energy. Furthermore, there was no real improvement on going from the
MP2 to MP4 level. This can be explained by the basis set used, where electron-correlation in the case of vdW
molecules result mainly from the fluctuation of the interacting dipoles. These fluctuations are either attractive
or repulsive and thus, the true wave function has slightly higher amplitude at one point (attractive) and a lower
one at another point (repulsive). The enhanced amplitude is expressed by a double excitation in the
configuration interaction wave function in which an s orbital of one atom is replaced by a p orbital on the same
atom. This is accounted for explicitly in the CCSD calculation. This leads to its ability in reproducing the
correlation interaction energy. In Moller-Plesset perturbation theory this double excitation makes an important
contribution to the first order wave function, and consequently to the second-order energy E(MP2). It is worth
noting that the correlation energy picked up at the MP2 level represents 99.9 % of the total correlation that can
be recovered at the MP4.
Table 4 lists the interaction energy for Ar2 cluster which were computed by using the five DFT methods at the
aug-correlated basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ). The corresponding potential energy functions were displayed in Figure

seemed to over-estimate the correlation interaction energy. Furthermore, it predicted an
which wa
was not
quite reliable as it was claimed to be, the potential energy curve was not steady and smooth specially around
the equilibrium separation and at the dissociative part of the curve. In contrast, the B97-D method was really
improved compared to B97-2 functional and it was also much better than the PBEPBE method. The three
functionals produced smooth potential energy curves that were consistent with that produced by the CCSD(T)
method. The total correlation energy picked up by the B97-D method is about 93% of the experimental value.
Furthermore, the Re value of 3.9 Å predicted by the B97-D method was in fair agreement with the
experimental value[29]. In conclusion the B97-D-DFT level was very fast when compared with the CCSD(T)
method. This advantage rendered it a good candidate for large molecular systems. Computation has been
extended to the Ar3 cluster. The DFT /aug-cc-pVTZ potential energy curves for both Ar2 and Ar3 are included
in
In conclusion, we have used three computational methods to account for Ar2 and Ar3 cluster tcorrelation
interaction energies; namely these were: CCDS(T), MPX and DFT methods. The CCSD(T) method was by far
more accurate and consistent for the present computation. Although, it was more time consuming, yet through
its stability, consistency and attained accuracy, it was by far much better than all other methods tested in this
work. Of the DFT functionals we used in this work, the B97-D and the PBE0 funtionals were the most reliable
ones. The basis set quality seemed also to be very important in accounting for Ar2 very week interaction. The
aug. correlated pVXZ ( where X=2,3 and 4) basis sets have been used in the present work in addition to the
popular Pople's 6-31++G** and the more extended 6-31++G(3df) basis sets. Very accurate well depths and
well positions can be obtained by extrapolation of the aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets to the CBS limit. In general, a
CCSD(T) computation at the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set acheived the minimum acceptable level of computation
that can be applied for estimating correlation energies of large aromatic clusters.

Table 3 lists the the well depths, equilibrium distances and basis set superposition errors (BSSE) obtained by
the different basis sets used in the present study. For the corrected interaction energies, the basis sets used in
this work showed repulsive interaction potential curves, except in the very small regions around the equilibrium
separation which exhibited essentially large BSSE. It is clear that our results for Ar2 cluster were consistent
with those of Liedl [17] and indicated clearly that CCSD(T) potentials seemed to converge better with
systematically increasing basis sets, if one was simply using uncorrected energies.

3.2 Excited State and Ionized Ar Clusters
In ion-beam experiments and other high energy experiments involving argon matrices, usually allow the
coexistence of not only ground state but also excited states clusters. In this section, we examine the low-lying
singlet and triplet excited states of argon dimers and trimers. Figure 4 shows the PES for the low lying singlet
Ar2. On the one hand, 1S state was a stable state whose configuration was almost similar to that of the ground
state. The binding correlation energy of 93 cm-1 is indicative of its the stability. The well position of 3.8 Å was
of the 1S state originated from a main
slightly greater than that of the ground state. The
configuration (37%) resulting from the highest occupied u MO( 18
22) and a minor configuration involving
MO( 13
19 ) which contributed only 6% to this state. These MO's were nonbonding and thus don't affect the
geometry or stability of Ar 2 cluster. The only bonding MO was 13 which had the g symmetry.
The triplet state on the other hand, was repulsive at all inter-atomic separations. The CCSD(T) method, using
the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set failed to locate a minimum on the potential energy curve. Ar2+ and Ar3+ are believed
to exist in high energy experiments. These positive ions are expected to play a very important role also in large
argon clusters. Thus, the stability of clusters of the form Ar +n( n=3,500) are believed to follow some magic
numbers with a core where the positive charge will be concentrated. This core is believed to be Ar2+ or Ar3+.
Figure 3 shows the potential energy surfaces for the Ar2+ and Ar3+ clusters which were computed at the
CCSD(T)/pVTZ level of theory. It is noted that the well position in case of the Ar2+ was shifted considerably
to shorter values. Thus, this ion was contracted and the positive charge wass concentrated to a much greater
extent than in the case of the Ar3+ ion. The positive charge seemed to be delocalized and as a result had s slight
effect on the optimum Re .

It should be noted that there were a convergence problem when modeling Ar3+ cluster by the B97-D DFT
method. Furthermore, the PBE0 method showed also divergence from selff consistency with the increase of Re
and it failed to converge at Re greater tha
DFT methods need further investigation.

Summary and Conclusions

The interatomic interaction energies for Ar2 and Ar3 clusters have been computed at the CCSD(T), MP2 and
MP3 and five DFT methods using basis sets of different qualities. Extrapolation to the basis set limit (CBS)
has been adopted. Results were compared to the theoretical benchmark and experimental data. The
computations have been extended to the excited states of Ar2 and Ar3 and their ionic species (Ar2+ and Ar3+).
Our results indicated clearly that the minimum acceptable level of theory to adequately compute weak nonbonded interactions will be the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level. The high speed and acceptable accuracy of the
B97-D and the DFT-PBE0 functionals made them good candidates for modeling large vdWs clusters.
