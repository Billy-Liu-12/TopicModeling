Abstract
Analysing subgraph patterns and recurring motifs in networks is a useful way to understand their local topology and function. Motifs have been considered useful in analysing design patterns of networks as well. Three-node patterns (triads) in
metabolic networks have been studied to some extent producing classiﬁcation of organisms based on triads, but their network
placement was not analysed. We obtain the frequencies of all four-node subgraphs in a wide range of metabolic networks. We
construct signiﬁcance proﬁles of subgraphs and employ correlation analysis to compare and contrast these proﬁles, highlighting four-node motifs. We then compute speciﬁc centrality measures of nodes involved in each subgraph, namely betweenness
centrality and closeness centrality. We observe that multiple four-node motifs exist in metabolic networks. The correlation
analysis shows that the signiﬁcance proﬁles of Eukaryotic networks are highly correlated across organisms, whereas those of
the Prokaryotic networks are correlated less so. The centrality indices of nodes that participate in identiﬁed network motifs
are shown to be quite high. The analysis provides a tool to pinpoint the transition between evolution stages of Prokaryotic and
Eukaryotic metabolic networks.

1. Introduction
It has been a recent trend in the complex networks community to use network motifs and subgraphs to analyse
the local structure and function of networks [1], [2], [3].Subgraph patterns consist of a small number of nodes and
the links between such nodes. A subgraph pattern becomes a motif of a network when that pattern occurs in the
given network statistically much more frequently than it would in an equivalent random network. Similarly, an
anti-motif is a subgraph pattern that occurs statistically much less frequently. The presence of a certain motif in a
network may mean that that motif plays an important role in the overall functionality of the network. Researchers
were able to explain recently the functionality of certain motifs, including their information processing and control
functions, in several biological networks such as gene regularity networks, cell signaling networks, virus and
protein protein interaction networks [1], [6] and [7]. For example, a feedforward loop in a gene regulatory network

can act as a pulse generator, whereas a feedforward loop with many outputs in a transcription network aids in First
In First Out (FIFO) queuing of signals and acts as a persistence detector [2]. Conversely, we can understand
the functionality of a network better if we are aware of which motifs are present in that network. Besides, it is
assumed that network motifs are preserved through evolution, or they tend to change less rapidly compared to the
‘random’ portions of the network, since they have speciﬁc functions. Recent work has however cast some doubts
on this view [8]. If this is true at least for some motifs, then by tracing the motifs in biological networks, we may
be able to get a glimpse at the evolution of such networks. In this paper, we analyse network motifs in metabolic
networks, focusing in addition on their placement (e.g., centrality) and composition.
Metabolic networks are networks of biochemical reactions catalised by enzymes acting on substrates [5]. The
metabolic networks of many organisms have been studied ([9],[5]) to show that metabolic pathways in various
organisms are surprisingly similar, and therefore the topology and evolution of metabolic networks can be studied
systematically and generalised. It has been shown that metabolic substrate networks are scale-free networks
with power law degree distributions [9]. Other network-level properties of metabolic networks, such as network
diameter, assortativeness, mutual information, and hierarchical organization have also been analysed in detail[9],
[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] and [16]. However, a complimentary approach of analysing the local patterns in
metabolic networks is necessary to get a fuller picture about the structure and function of these.
Metabolic networks display many discernible subgraph patterns. Eom and colleagues [5] undertook some
pioneering work in analysing subgraph patterns in metabolic networks. They analysed 43 diﬀerent organisms
from three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota. However, their work has been limited to three-node
patterns (triads). Most of the important motifs in biological networks for which the functionality is understood
have four or more nodes involved [2], [1], [7] and [11]. Therefore, in this paper we consider the same set of
organisms and analyse motifs with four or more nodes. Speciﬁcally, we present a thorough analysis of four-node
subgraphs, and generalise our observations toward higher number of nodes. We also address the importance of
the locations in networks topology where motifs appear, by looking at various centrality measures of nodes that
form motifs. This adds a new perspective about the debate about whether the appearance of motifs is a random
phenomenon.
Let us brieﬂy describe the structure of this paper. We ﬁrst look at the signiﬁcance proﬁles of all subgraphs
in metabolic networks, to determine which subgraph patterns can qualify as motifs or anti-motifs. Then we analyse the correlation of such signiﬁcance proﬁles between various organisms. In the following section, we apply
centrality measures to nodes participating in motifs, with the view of determining the importance of placement of
motifs in network topology. This is followed by a discussion of our ﬁndings and conclusion.
The metabolic networks we consider are substrate networks, where the nodes represent metabolic substrates
and the links represent the biochemical reactions between them. Intermediate substrates are also considered. Substrate networks are shown to be scale-free networks with typical scale free exponents between 2.0 and 3.0 [9]. The
networks are considered as directed networks, and a reversible reaction is represented as two links with opposing
directions. The data is obtained from the WIT database [17] and is also available from [18].

2. Network motifs and signiﬁcance proﬁles
We considered all possible subgraph patterns which involve four nodes. In total, 199 such subgraph patterns
are possible [2]. For each metabolic network, we counted the number of occurrences of each subgraph. However,
the number of occurrences depends on the size of the network, therefore we cannot compare various metabolic
networks by comparing the number of occurrences of each subgraph. Furthermore, we need to know whether these
occurrences are somehow special for the given metabolic networks, or they would have occurred in any network.
To achieve this, we compared the number of occurrences of a given motif in each of the metabolic networks with
the number of occurrences in an ensemble of equivalent random networks (i.e, random networks with the same
number of nodes, links, and identical degree distributions). We then obtained the statistical signiﬁcance of the
number of occurrences by calculating its z score. The z score of a given subgraph i is:

Zi =

Ni − N i

(1)

rand

where N i is the average number of occurrences of the subgraph in the ensemble of random networks. The
std(Nirand ) is the standard deviation of occurrences across the ensemble, and Ni is the number of occurrences in the
metabolic network under consideration. a z score in excess of +3.00 [19] means that the given subgraph appears
too frequently to be a random phenomenon, and therefore must have statistical signiﬁcance. Thus it can be called
a ‘motif’ of the graph. Similarly, any subgraph pattern with a z score less than -3.00 occurs much less frequently
than in the random case, and is called an ‘anti-motif’. The occurrence of an anti-motif may mean that the corresponding subgraph pattern hinders the functionality of the network, and was therefore avoided in the process of
evolution.

random graphs was used for comparison, and the random graphs were constructed in a way that their degree distributions were identical (as much as possible within ﬁnite scale eﬀects) to the considered metabolic graph. Our
results are shown in Figures 1a, 1b, 2 and Table 1. From these ﬁgures we can see that many very strong motifs
exist in metabolic networks. Indeed, some have z scores as high as +300.00.

Table 1: Dominant four node motifs and anti motifs in metabolic networks. The numbers in the columns are motif
IDs. All motifs have a z score in excess of +3.00 and all anti-motifs have a z score less than -3.00. Only the three
motifs with highest z scores and three anti-motifs with lowest z scores are shown for each metabolic network.

To further quantify our results, following Eom et al [5], we constructed the normalised signiﬁcance proﬁle
for all motifs for each of the metabolic networks [5] and [1]. A normalised signiﬁcance proﬁle indicates how
relatively important a motif is in comparison to other motifs in network topology. A motif with a z score slightly
more than +3.00 is statistically signiﬁcant, but may be insigniﬁcant when compared to a motif with a z score of
many hundreds. Thus it becomes imperative to normalise z scores. Since z scores can be positive or negative, they
have to be normalised by dividing them by the squared sum of z scores of a network, that is:

where Zˆi is the normalised z score for subgraph i. Now for each network, we can plot the normalised z
scores against subgraph patterns. Three such plots are given in ﬁgures 3,4, 5 for Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota
respectively.

Fig. 6: The dominant network motifs in metabolic networks with their IDs.
We notice that the signiﬁcance proﬁles for all metabolic networks are highly similar, with the most dominant
motifs being motifs 16920, 18568, and 4748, as shown in Fig 6. Motif 16920 is the well known feedback loop motif, whereas motif 4748 is a feedforward loop superimposed on a feedback loop (note the presence of a reversible
reaction). It has been noted by [5] that feedforward loops serve often as ‘shortcuts’ to some substrates. The motif
18568 is a type of multi-input motif. Other common motifs are diamond (two loops leading from the same source
node to the same common destination - ID 2182), and several kinds of multi-output motifs, and various superimpositions of these motifs caused mainly by reversible reactions. The very high occurrence of feedback loop (it has
an average score of about z = 135) indicates that many metabolic substrates are reused in metabolic pathways.
3. Correlation of signiﬁcance proﬁles
To understand the evolution of metabolic pathways, it is important to note the diﬀerences between the sigficance proﬁles of metabolic networks in terms of the relative abundance of each motif in them. Therefore, we
now focus on analysing how similar the signiﬁcance proﬁles are between various metabolic networks, by calculating correlation coeﬃcients between these proﬁles. We computed correlation coeﬃcient rX,Y for all pairs of
organisms in a domain, producing the average correlation coeﬃcient for each domain rˆdomain , as well as the average across all domains rˆ. We found that the average correlation coeﬃcient rˆ between signiﬁcance proﬁles of
metabolic networks in all domains is about 0.64, indicating that the similarity of occurrence of four node motifs is
reasonably high among all the metabolic networks. Furthermore, considering the three domains of life (Archaea,
Bacteria, Eukaryote) separately, we found that the correlation coeﬃcients are rˆarchaea = 0.63, rˆbacteria = 0.61, and
rˆeukaryota = 0.70 respectively. Fig 7 shows the correlation coeﬃcient between all pairs of organisms. We note that
the correlation is, on average, much higher when the Eukaryotes are considered separately, while the metabolic
networks among Bacteria and Archaea have lower correlations. This means that the Eukaryota have more similar
motifs compared to Prokaryota (Bacteria and Archaea), and the Prokaryota have relatively diﬀerent motif patterns
among themselves. This correlation analysis provides a tool to pinpoint the transition between evolution stages of
Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic metabolic networks.
4. Centrality of nodes participating in four-node motifs
Now we turn our attention to the placement of motifs in the metabolic network topology. We are interested in
ﬁnding out whether the motifs can appear randomly in any part of the network, or they are more likely to occur
in parts of networks which have some topological signiﬁcance. If the motifs appear in important parts of the
topology, they are more likely to be preserved in network evolution, since tampering with the topology in these
parts is more likely to aﬀect the rest of the network. Therefore, we next consider the strategic importance of the
placement of motifs, utilising centrality measures.
Various centrality measures have been proposed to measure a node’s relative importance in a network. Some
of these are closeness centrality [22], [23] and betweenness centrality [24]. High centrality scores indicate that

Fig. 8: Average betweenness centrality of motifs in metabolic networks. Six metabolic networks are illustrated
here. Two from Archaea (AG, TH), two from Bacteria (AA, HP), and two from Eukaryota (AT, CE). The network
betweenness centrality averages are: AG = 6192.4, TH = 5272.7, AA= 4720.6 , HP = 4185.6 , AT = 3246.8, CE
= 5315.8

Let us look at the betweenness centrality values of all nodes which participate in a given motif in a network,
and calculate their average. For example, if there were 35 nodes which participated in the ‘Bi-fan’ motifs in
the metabolic network of H. pylori, we calculated the betweenness centrality average of all these 35 nodes. It is
possible that one node is part of more than one instance of the motif. In this case we still counted the node once.
We calculated the average betweenness centrality of each motif (which we denote as Cˆ iB for each motif i) in this

where Ni is number of contributing nodes. Assuming that the network G has MG motifs, we can compute

proﬁles.

the average Cˆ B (MG ) is always much higher than Cˆ B or Cˆ min

It is easily observable from Fig 8 that nodes which constitute the motifs have much higher betweenness centrality values than the network average. In each of the network, nearly all motifs that occur in that network have a
higher Cˆ iB than the network average Cˆ B . This point is further illustrated in Fig 9. On the other hand, many motifs
in each network have a much higher average betweenness centrality than the network average. In short, we can
observe that motifs occur in regions with nodes with a higher betweenness centrality — that is, motifs appear in
regions that are strategically important to network. Assuming that in any network the ﬂow is likely to be through
the shortest paths, we can also say that the network motifs occur in topological areas with high density of shortcuts
in metabolic pathways.
We analysed closeness centrality of motifs and obtained similar results (denoting the average motif closeness
centrality by Cˆ iC and average network closeness centrality as Cˆ C ; replacing superscript B with C in the equations
(3), (4), and (5) allows to deﬁne the respective quantities for closeness centrality). However, unlike the previous
case, there were many motifs with a lower closeness centrality than the network average, even though the majority

of the motifs still had a higher closeness centrality than the network average. This contrast is illustrated in Fig 10a
and Fig 10b.

Let us look deeper into the results in Fig 8. It is apparent that some motifs have much higher Cˆ iB than other
motifs, and these motifs seem to have higher Cˆ iB for all species. For example, motifs 8588, 2198, 8844 and 716
are the ones with the highest Cˆ iB in any metabolic network. On the other hand, motifs 972, 536, and 150 are the
motifs with the lowest Cˆ iB . The motif that has the highest Cˆ iB for most organisms is 8588, which is more or less a
‘straight line’ with two reversible reactions sandwiching a one-way reaction. This motif therefore must function
as an ‘bottleneck’, through which a lot of shortest paths pass. The other motifs with high betweenness centrality
values are combinations of feedforward loop and diamond motifs.
From the above results, we can state that, ﬁrstly (for metabolic networks), network motifs do not have an equal
probability of occurrence in all parts of network topology. Motifs are preserved more in areas where there are a
lot of shortest paths, i.e in areas of high shortest path density. Secondly, some motifs have a higher tendency to be
found in areas of high shortest path density than others. One may assume that these are motifs that have a lot of
‘traﬃc’ — that is, a lot of metabolic pathways going through them.
5. Conclusions
In this paper we analysed the four-node motif patterns of metabolic networks in detail, using forty three model
organisms from three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota. A subgraph pattern is considered a motif
when it occurs in the network statistically more frequently than it would in an equivalent random network. We
obtained frequencies of occurrences and corresponding signiﬁcance proﬁles for all subgraph patterns, identifying
dominant motifs based on these proﬁles. We found that the dominant four-node motifs can be observed in all
metabolic networks. By comparing the signiﬁcance proﬁles with those of other biological networks, we found
that the dominant motifs in metabolic networks are markedly diﬀerent from those in other biological networks.
Employing correlation analysis, we observed that, within the set of metabolic networks, the four-node motifs
among Eukaryotic networks are highly similar, while those among Bacterial and Archaic networks are less so.
Thus, the analysis pinpointed the transition between evolution stages of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic metabolic
networks.
To determine the topological placement of motifs in metabolic networks, we analysed the betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of nodes that belong to motifs. We found that the four-node motifs have diﬀerent
likelihoods of occurring that depend on their placement within the network. They are more likely to appear in
areas with high shortest path density. In other words, the nodes that belong to four-node motifs are more likely

418

to be on the shortest paths of the network. Most motifs also contain nodes which have high closeness centrality,
i.e., they are likely to be closer to the network core. In summary, the presented analysis provides a means for (i)
identifying the dominant motifs by constructing statistical signiﬁcance proﬁles of subgraphs, (ii) contrasting the
signiﬁcance proﬁles across diﬀerent organisms and domains of life; and (iii) studying the topological importance
of the motifs in terms of centrality measures.
