Abstract
Many novel therapeutics originally aimed at a speciÔ¨Åc protein have in fact complex target proÔ¨Åles and interact promiscuously
with many other proteins and pathways. Discovering new molecular targets and related pharmacodynamic eÔ¨Äectors for existing
drugs can help us understand mechanisms behind drug resistance, discover potential side eÔ¨Äects, and point to target for new
drugs. Often, the study of novel targets and receptors starts with building up diverse panel of drug sensitive and resistant cell
lines, which is then proÔ¨Åled using high-throughput method such as gene expression microarrays or proteomic arrays. Analysis
of proÔ¨Åling data requires statistical methods that move beyond univariate tests of diÔ¨Äerential expression between sensitive
and resistant cell lines. Here, we propose a new approach for analysing diÔ¨Äerential co-expression, which allows for detecting
changes of co-expression pattern in gene pairs, bringing spotlight on the diÔ¨Äerences in complex dynamic relationships and
regulation mechanisms between genes in sensitive and resistant phenotypes. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed
approach can deal with confounding factors such as tissue heterogeneity of the cell line panels that leads to presence of
clusters and outliers, and together with relatively small number of samples can result in many false discoveries. We applied
our method to study diÔ¨Äerences of gene co-expression patterns between cell lines sensitive and resistant to dasatinib, a novel
targeted anticancer drug, and we discovered a closely-linked network of diÔ¨Äerentially co-expressed genes related to molecular
eÔ¨Äects of the drug.

1. Introduction
Improved understanding of cancer origins and progression has lead in recent years to the development of a
number of targeted therapeutics [1], designed to interact with a selected molecular target chosen based on its role
in the disease. One class of molecular targets that attracts focus of anti-cancer drug development eÔ¨Äorts is tyrosine
kinases [2], which have pivotal role in triggering trans-membrane signalling, cell-cycle control, cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and other cellular signal transduction cascades [3]. Instead of non-selectively killing rapidly
dividing cells, targeted therapeutics function by inhibiting speciÔ¨Åc tyrosine kinases, thus deactivating downstream
signal transduction cascades [4]. For example, imatinib aims at inhibition of the ATP binding domain of Bcr-Abl
fusion protein, a permanently active tyrosine kinase caused by translocation between chromosome 9 and 22 that
leads to chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, despite early success in prolonging patient survival, resistance

to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib has become a common problem [5]. Second generation inhibitors,
such as dasatinib [6], are being developed to treat resistant tumours.
It is increasingly evident that even speciÔ¨Åcally targeted therapeutics have complex activity proÔ¨Åles and are
often promiscuous [7]. Imatinib was shown to bind to c-KIT, DDR1 and PDGFR [8]. Dasatinib, designed as a
dual Src/Abl inhibitor for imatinib-resistant cancer patients, turned out to have even broader target spectrum [8, 9].
These discoveries made possible repositioning of existing drugs towards other types of cancer [10]. Also, they
allow for tailoring the treatment to subgroups of patients with particular molecular patters [11]. Further, they bring
new knowledge on the possible side-eÔ¨Äects of the treatment and point to candidate targets for novel therapies.
Uncovering previously unknown target proteins and pathways for existing drugs typically involves analyses
of high-throughput in vitro assays, followed up by more detailed biochemical analyses [11]. The screening step
works by searching for molecular diÔ¨Äerences between cell lines sensitive to the drug and those resistant to it,
using modalities such as gene expression microarrays. At this step, the most common approach is to employ
statistical tests for diÔ¨Äerential expression of individual genes. However, a single-gene diÔ¨Äerence is not likely to
explain the complexity of drug eÔ¨Äects on studied disease [12]. Also, these methods only reveal eÔ¨Äects that are
strong enough to pass the threshold resulting from corrections for multiple hypothesis testing, and may also miss
diÔ¨Äerences that involve multiple genes, but don‚Äôt manifest themselves clearly in any gene individually. Another
approach is to create multivariate discriminative models that are able to predict which cell lines are sensitive and
which are resistant, based on patterns of gene expression. While these models may have good predictive power,
their interpretability is often poor.
2. DiÔ¨Äerential Co-Expression
DiÔ¨Äerential co-expression analysis is gaining attention in recent years as a tool for Ô¨Ånding phenotypic diÔ¨Äerences that are more complex than univariate diÔ¨Äerences, but has not been used yet in studying drug targets and
their downstream eÔ¨Äectors. The approach aims at detecting pairs of genes that show diÔ¨Äerences in gene regulation
and cellular signalling between two phenotypes. DiÔ¨Äerential co-expression brings a new perspective on diÔ¨Äerence
between phenotypes ‚Äì that a speciÔ¨Åc phenotype could result from diÔ¨Äerences in gene regulation that do not signiÔ¨Åcantly alter average expression levels of genes, but alter the pattern of behaviour of the genes in tandem. For
example, a pair of genes may be tightly correlated in drug sensitive cells, where one of the genes regulates the
other, but uncorrelated in resistant cells, where the regulation is lost due to mutation. This idea has been proven
true in a lot of biological conditions such as obesity [13], aging [14] and cancer [15].
Existing diÔ¨Äerential co-expression detection methods usually measure some gene pair relationship score separately in each phenotype condition, then compare the diÔ¨Äerence of these scores. The score most often used is the
Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient, applied in conjunction with Fisher‚Äôs Z transformation [16, 17] that yields a probability distribution of the diÔ¨Äerences in correlation. However, Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient is highly aÔ¨Äected
by outlying samples. EÔ¨Äorts to make correlation more resilient to outliers were undertaken by using biweight
midcorrelation [18]. Rank-based and entropy-based measurements [19], as well as F-statistic [20] are also used.
In terms of the number of gene as a unit in the diÔ¨Äerential co-expression network, some methods aim at gene pairs
while others aim at gene modules [21, 22, 23].
Here, we report an approach for diÔ¨Äerential co-expression analysis of molecular determinants of cell lines
response to drugs. We focus on a recently introduced tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, and its response proÔ¨Åle
in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines, the most widely studied cell line used for anti-cancer drug development. We
present an integrated method for dealing with problems common in cell line panels used for drug screens, such as
diversity of cell types, presence of outliers, and existence of tissue clusters. These problems make existing methods
for diÔ¨Äerential co-expression unsuitable for studying such complex datasets. To illustrate this, we applied ROSDET [18], a recently published method for diÔ¨Äerential co-expression designed to be more resilient to outliers,
range bias and small sample size, to a dataset of cell lines from the NCI-60 panel, preprocessed as described in
Section 3 and 4.1. We present the 10 most highly ranked diÔ¨Äerential co-expression gene pairs detected by ROSDET in Fig. 1. With the exception of the PSMG1 - OSBPL7 pair (Fig. 1, top row, second plot from left), no clear
evidence for diÔ¨Äerential co-expression can be observed in the top ranked pairs. In all cases, the two classes overlap,
and outliers pose a problem, as can be seen in the third (TXNDC11-CCDC101) and fourth (PFAS-AGBL4) best
ranked pairs. These results show the need for new, improved methods for detecting diÔ¨Äerential co-expression.

resistant in black. DiÔ¨Äerent symbols represent diÔ¨Äerent tissue type of a sample. Axes represent log-expression of the corresponding genes.

3. Cell Assay and Drug Response Data
We chose NCI-60 human cancer cell line panel as our model dataset. It consists currently of 59 cell lines from
nine diÔ¨Äerent tissues of origin including brain, blood and bone marrow, breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovary, prostate
and skin. It has become the most extensively characterized public resource for in vitro cancer research, with
available information on drug screening, DNA copy number, mRNA, protein and microRNA expression proÔ¨Åles,
mutation and methylation.
From the NCI CellMiner [24] website we downloaded the log-transformed, normalized Agilent Whole Human
Genome 44K Microarray dataset [25] with 41,000-probes for the 59 cell lines. From the NCI Developmental
Therapeutics Program Molecular Targets [26] website we downloaded cell lines drug responses measured for the
set of FDA‚Äìapproved anticancer agents [27]. For each cell and drug, the response is measured as ‚àí log10 (GI50 ),
the negated logarithm of concentration that results in 50% growth inhibition.
To choose drugs for diÔ¨Äerential co-expression study, we have used several criteria. First, we excluded drugs
that had missing values in drug response data. Second, we excluded drugs with less than 25% of cell lines where
dasatinib is active, where activity was deÔ¨Åned as ‚àí log10 (GI50 ) equal to 6 or higher, that is, 50% growth inhibition
concentration lower than 10‚àí6 mol/L, a commonly used threshold. Finally, we only selected drugs where top
33% of cell lines were dasatinib-sensitive, and bottom 33% were resistant, again using ‚àí log10 (GI50 ) of 6 as the
threshold, and where the diÔ¨Äerence between the 33-percentile and 66-percentile of ‚àí log10 (GI50 ) values was lower
than one, which translates to one order of magnitude in concentration units. After the screening, we focused on
dasatinib, one of the two drugs from the set that passed all criteria. In NCI-60 cell panel, 20 cell lines are sensitive
to dasatinib, with log10 (GI50 ) < ‚àí7.3, and 19 are resistant, with log10 (GI50 ) > ‚àí5.5.
4. Proposed Method
Our proposed method operates in three stages. In the Ô¨Årst stage, we deal with the problem of Ô¨Åltering out nonexpressed genes in the presence of outliers. Next, we address the problem of a correlation structures that seem
to indicate diÔ¨Äerential co-expression, but in fact are false positives driven by the cluster structure in the dataset,
reÔ¨Çecting diÔ¨Äerent tissues of origin in the cell line panel. Once that issue is resolved, we progress to quantifying
diÔ¨Äerences in co-expression for pairs of genes, and to assessing statistical signiÔ¨Åcance of the diÔ¨Äerences.
4.1. Filtering out Non-expressed Genes in the Presence of Outliers
It is common practice in microarray normalization to remove gene probes with maximal expression below a
certain threshold. However, in a panel of diverse cell lines, presence of outliers may prevent some genes from
being Ô¨Åltered out, by inÔ¨Çating the maximum expression. As illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 2, pairs of genes
that are only expressed in a small number of cell lines can lead to spurious detection of diÔ¨Äerential co-expression.
To alleviate this problem, we inspected the intensity distribution of all the probes across NCI-60 cell lines (right
panel of Fig. 2). We observed two overlapped approximately-normal distributions, one centred around -7 logexpression and tailing at around -6 log-expression, and another one centred at around 0. The Ô¨Årst peak is caused

1395

by background noise of Agilent chips in non-expressed genes. To Ô¨Ålter out probes with only a few expressed
outliers, we discarded all probes where 90% percentile expression across all the cell lines was lower than -6.

4.2. Eliminating False Positives Resulting from Tissue Clusters
In cell line panels consisting of diÔ¨Äerent tissue types, many genes exhibit outliers or small clusters, often
related to a speciÔ¨Åc tissue type. These may lead to spurious detection of diÔ¨Äerential co-expression in existing
methods. For example, large shift may happen in Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient due to a single outlier or small
number of outlying samples as illustrated in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. False positive diÔ¨Äerential co-expression gene pairs caused by outlying sample clusters. Cell lines sensitive to dasatinib in red, resistant
in black. Axes represent log-expression of the corresponding genes.

We developed a sliding window min-max score to Ô¨Ålter genes and gene pairs where the diÔ¨Äerential coexpression score is artiÔ¨Åcially inÔ¨Çated due to outliers. Our method treats the two classes, drug sensitive and
drug resistant cell lines, separately but in parallel. First, for each gene expression probe, we sort the data independently in each of the two classes according to their expression ek,l
i , arriving for gene probe k and class l with
k,l
k,l
k,l
an ascending order ek,l
1 ‚â§ e2 ‚â§ ... ‚â§ en‚àí1 ‚â§ en , where n is the number of samples in class k. Next, we deÔ¨Åne a
window of size w ‚àà [0, 1], and determine a set of distances dik,l between points at the opposing ends of the window
k,l
dik,l = ek,l
v+i‚àí1 ‚àí ei ,

(1)

where v = w √ó n, and i takes values from {1, ..., (n ‚àí v + 1)}. The distance is a generalization of interquartile range
to a window spanning fraction w of samples of the expression in a given class for a given gene, and sliding in a
way that the window covers all possible contiguous fractions of points. Based on the set of window widths dik,l for
k,l
k,l
and the minimum window width dmin
.
all i we deÔ¨Åne the maximum window width dmax
We then deÔ¨Åne the min-max score for detecting outliers for gene k and class l as a ratio
S k,l =

k,l
dmin
k,l
dmax

.

Informally, the score represents the proportion between the width of the major cluster of samples and the
distance of any suÔ¨Éciently large outlying cluster from the major cluster. The smaller the score is, the further
the outlying sample cluster is. If the score approaches to 1, no outlying sample cluster of tolerant size exists.
Conversely, score approaching 0 indicates that there is a cluster of a size deÔ¨Åned by the parameter w far away from
the majority of samples. To remove pairs of genes that exhibit excessive outliers or small outlying clusters, we set
a threshold tS and Ô¨Ålter out cases where S k,l ‚â§ tS .
Because our method is looking for pairs of genes, not individual genes, we Ô¨Ålter out pairs with outlying clusters
in both classes but keep edges with outlying clusters in only one classes. To select gene pairs as acceptable for
further study we deÔ¨Åne two rules. Each gene pair has to satisfy either rule (i) or rule (ii):
(i) for both drug sensitive class I and resistant class II, genes i, j both have min-max scores above the threshold:
(S i,I > tS ) ‚àß (S j,I > tS ) ‚àß (S i,II > tS ) ‚àß (S j,II > tS )

(3)

(ii) for at least one drug class, expression values of genes i, j are highly correlated, and both genes have minmax score greater than the threshold:
ij
(S i,I > tS ) ‚àß (S j,I > tS ) ‚àß (|rIi j | > tr ) ‚à® (S i,II > tS ) ‚àß (S j,II > tS ) ‚àß (|rII
| > tr )

(4)

In eÔ¨Äect, pairs of genes with no outlying clusters in either class are retained by rule (i). An example of a pair
meeting the conditions speciÔ¨Åed in rule (i) is depicted in Fig. 4, left panel. Pairs with highly correlated genes and
no outliers at least in one class will be kept even if another class contains outliers (for an example of such a pair,
see Fig. 4, right panel). In other words, we accept a pair of genes even if it has outliers in one of the classes, as
long as the other class has no outliers and the two genes are highly correlated in that class.

as long as the other class is highly correlated. Cell lines sensitive to dasatinib in red, resistant in black. Axes represent log-expression of the
corresponding genes.

4.3. QuantiÔ¨Åcation of DiÔ¨Äerential Co-Expression
To focus on pairs of genes with diÔ¨Äerential co-expression, and to remove false positives composed of diÔ¨Äerences that are univariate, we removed genes where diÔ¨Äerences between sensitive and resistant groups were driven
mostly by a single gene. To this end, we applied Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test, and excluded genes with
p-value below 0.05. Similarly, we discarded genes where the diÔ¨Äerences between classes were not in average
expression levels, but instead there was large diÔ¨Äerence in expression variance, or in within-class ranges of expression. For this task, we employed the Levene non-parametric test, and Ô¨Åltered out genes with p-value below
0.05.
Next, we estimated Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient for samples from drug sensitive and drug resistant groups
separately, obtaining coeÔ¨Écients r1 and r2 . We then applied the Fisher‚Äôs Z transformation [28] to the coeÔ¨Écients
to obtain a test statistic z:
z1 ‚àí z 2
z=
,
1
1
+
n1 ‚àí3
n2 ‚àí3

Xi Gao and Tomasz Arodz / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 1392 ‚Äì 1401

where
zi =

1 1 + ri
ln
,
2 1 ‚àí ri

and ni is the number of samples in group i. As z approximately follows normal distribution, we could get the
probability of null hypothesis H0 : r1 = r2 and reject it at certain level of signiÔ¨Åcance. Here, we keep gene pairs
that are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at 0.05 after Bonferroni correction as the Ô¨Ånal result of our method.
Statistically speaking, highly correlation coeÔ¨Écients with small diÔ¨Äerence, say r1 = 0.99 and r2 = 0.9 are
equally diÔ¨Äerent as high and low correlation coeÔ¨Écient, say r1 = 0.9 and r2 = 0.3. However, biologically speaking,
we are much more interested in detecting the second case which indicates impaired regulation in one class. So we
correct any correlation coeÔ¨Écient greater than 0.95 or less than -0.95 to 0.95 and -0.95, respectively, to avoid its
eÔ¨Äect on result.

4.4. Selection of Method Parameters
There are three parameters in our method that inÔ¨Çuence which edges will be detected as representing diÔ¨Äerential co-expression: window size w, min-max score threshold tS for min-max score, and class-speciÔ¨Åc correlation
coeÔ¨Écient threshold tr . In this study, we use window size w = 0.9, a value that leads to Ô¨Åltering out outlying
clusters containing up to 10% of samples. To choose the optimal value of threshold tS , we Ô¨Årst analysed the total
number of gene pairs detected using diÔ¨Äerent thresholds values while keeping tr at 0. We also analysed how many
pairs are detected by rule (i) and how many by rule (ii). The results are shown in left panel of Fig. 5.

Fig. 5. Number of edges in the result for diÔ¨Äerent min-max score threshold tS (left) and number of edges in the result for diÔ¨Äerent correlation
coeÔ¨Écient threshold tr (right).

Gene pairs generated by rule (i) contain no outlying sample clusters, while edges generated by rule (ii) allow
outlying sample cluster in only one class. As the threshold tS for min-max score grows, the requirement of
smoothness of data grows, the number of edge generated by rule (i) drops and number of edges generated by rule
(ii) grows. While at low values of t s most gene pairs added by rule (ii) are true diÔ¨Äerential edges, most edges added
when min-max score threshold grows greater than 0.6 are false discoveries. We choose min-max score threshold
tS = 0.5 to eliminate most false positives.
After setting the value of tS , we proceeded to Ô¨Ånd the value for the correlation coeÔ¨Écient threshold tr for the
class without outlying cluster, which is used in rule (ii). As illustrated in right panel of Fig. 5, with Ô¨Åxed t s = 0.5,
this additional condition has no eÔ¨Äect on the number of gene pairs generated by rule (i) but Ô¨Ålter out the pairs
generated by rule (ii). We choose coeÔ¨Écient threshold tr = 0.5 to further limit the number of false discoveries.
5. Results and Discussion
We have observed 82 gene pairs exhibiting statistically signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerential co-expression. We separate Ô¨Ånal
results into gene pairs selected by rule (i) and rule (ii). Gene pairs generated by rule (i) have no outlying cluster
deÔ¨Åned by algorithm for neither class. Pairs of genes generated by rule (ii) have outlying cluster in samples from
one class, and are accepted as long as the other class contains no outliers and exhibits high correlation between
the two genes. Of the 82 detected gene pairs, 51 follow rule (i), and 31 follow rule (ii).
In our results, we observe three main types of diÔ¨Äerential co-expression ‚Äì impaired regulation, switch mechanism and L-shaped regulation (see Fig. 6 for schematic examples). In cases of impaired regulation, two genes are

positively or negatively correlated under one experimental condition, but are not correlated in the other condition.
In the switching mechanism, two genes are correlated in both phenotype groups, but the correlation is positive
in one group, and negative in the other. The third type, L-shaped regulation, involves two genes that are linearly
correlated in one class while form an L-shaped pattern in the other. The L-shape reÔ¨Çects a mutually exclusive
relationship within the gene pair: only one, but not both, of the genes could be highly expressed.
The switching mechanism is the most abundant type of diÔ¨Äerential co-expression, followed by L-shaped regulation. We discovered only a few examples of impaired regulation. The rule (ii) allowed us to discover many
cases of diÔ¨Äerential co-expression that would otherwise be missed. In most cases, the outlier in those pairs is the
K562 leukemia cell line, which conforms to the fact that dasatinib targets the Philadelphia chromosome-positive

chronic myelogenous leukemia [6] that the cell line represents.
We integrated all the statistically signiÔ¨Åcant gene pairs into a diÔ¨Äerential co-expression network depicted in
Fig. 7. In addition to diÔ¨Äerential co-expression gene pairs, we calculated Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écients between
all samples in the genes in the network, and added co-expression edges between genes with Bonferroni-corrected
correlation statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at 0.05. The network is tightly linked, with many genes involved in diÔ¨Äerential
co-expression signiÔ¨Åcantly intercorrelated with each other.
Pairs of diÔ¨Äerentially co-expressed genes merit detailed exploration. Here we provide such a study for a
small number of gene pairs. Their expression patterns are depicted in Fig. 8. First set of pairs we focus on
is deÔ¨Åned by the star-shaped motif in the diÔ¨Äerential network that includes PAX8 and UGT2B genes. UGT
encodes UDP glucuronosyltransferase, an important metabolism protein that exists in diÔ¨Äerent tissues, especially
hepatic tissue. It is known to be regulated by phosphorylation and recent discovery reveals that UGT2B7 requires
Src-supported tyrosine phosphorylation [29]. It is noteworthy that dasatinib is known to target Src. The other
gene in the pair, the paired box gene 8 (PAX8), is an important transcription factor family mainly known for its
function at thyroid follicular cell diÔ¨Äerentiation and thyroid-speciÔ¨Åc gene expression [30]. Mutation of PAX8
may lead to thyroid follicular carcinomas. As show in the Fig. 8, positive correlation exists in drug sensitive group
and this correlation is switched and relaxed among drug resistant samples. Assuming the positive correlation
represents unique pathway among drug sensitive samples, tyrosine kinase inhibition would cut down this pathway
by inactivating UGT ‚Äì if this regulated pathway is vital for cancer growth the cell lines will be sensitive to the
drug. However, for those cell lines where growth does not rely on this speciÔ¨Åc pathway, inactivation of UGT
would put no signiÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äect on the tumour cells, making them drug resistant.
Dasatinib is used in inmatinib intolerant patients - the common side eÔ¨Äect of hepatotoxicity of inmatinib
does not appear in dasatinib. A recent pharmaco-genomics study reveals the potential mechanism of paracetamol
hepatotoxicity when it is co-administrated with Ô¨Årst generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. The mechanism
involves UGT inhibition, and UGT1A9 has been identiÔ¨Åed as the responsible isoform [31]. As seen in the network
in Fig. 7, all UGT belong to UTG2B family, which brings new view of isoform speciÔ¨Åcity of dasatinib.
Another gene pair consists of BMX and HBA2. BMX, a member of Tec family of phosphorylation tyrosine
kinases, is a recently identiÔ¨Åed dasatinib speciÔ¨Åc drug target [9]. HBA2 is alpha globin chain of hemoglobin. We
observed an interesting diÔ¨Äerential co-expression pattern between BMX and HBA2 ‚Äì dasatinib sensitive samples
form a highly correlated dense cluster with Bcr-Abl leukemia cell line K562 outlying at a very high expression
level along the regression line formed by drug sensitive samples. However, this correlation is lost in drug resistant
samples. Evidence has been found that BMX induces activation of Stat pathway and apoptosis of cells in breast
cancer [32] while inhibition of BMX by inactivating upstream tyrosine kinase FAK and Src causes drug resistance

in prostate cancer cells [33].
A cluster of gene pairs is related to integrin. Besides its cell adhesion function, integrin plays an important
in signal transduction crucial to cell survival and apoptosis. In our network we could observe a star-shaped subnetwork formed by diÔ¨Äerential co-expression edges centred at APBB1IP, also known as RAP1-PTG-interacting
adapter molecule (RIAM). It is known to activate integrin via Ras GTPase [34]. We found a pair relating APBB1IP
to Ras signaling, the APBB1P-RASSF5 pair, and a pair linking APBB1P with PECAM1, which is a ligand for
integrin [35].
In one other diÔ¨Äerentially co-expressed pair, the actin binding LIM protein family, member 3 (ABLIM3)
gene expression is positively correlated with expression of the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) in dasatinibsensitive cell lines, but negatively correlated in drug resistant cells. Previous studies shown that there is a link
between the two genes - injection of interferon-Œ± results in 3-fold increase in ABLIM3 expression in chimpanzee
livers [36]. IRF-1 was shown to acts as a tumour suppressor and is inactivated in cancers including acute myelocytic leukemia. Its deletion was shown to correlate with low hemoglobin level, as in our network [37].
Finally, in our network we observe that glutaminase (GLS) expression is negatively correlated with scavenger
mRNA-decapping enzyme (DPSC1L) in sensitive cell lines, but positively in resistant cell lines. Cancers exhibit
shift to increased rate of glutamine metabolism [38] and the cancer micro-environment is acidic. A study of renal
response to acidosis established a role for decaping enzymes in regulation of glutaminase mRNA [39].
All the examples above show that diÔ¨Äerential co-expression is a technique that can lead to new observations
regarding the mechanisms of drug action, resistance and side eÔ¨Äects. In all the detected pairs, as can be observed
in Fig. 8, at least one class shows a clear patter of correlation without impact of outliers, while the other class either
shows clear correlation pattern in an opposite direction indicative of the switching mechanism, or appears to be
randomly scattered or L-shaped, pointing to lost regulation or threshold behavior. This is contrast with the results
we obtained for an existing method presented in Fig. 1, which struggled with detecting meaningful examples of
diÔ¨Äerential co-expression.
6. Conclusions
We have studied diÔ¨Äerential co-expression between cancer cell lines sensitive and resistant to a recently introduced second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib. While existing methods have problems with
detecting diÔ¨Äerential co-expression cases where outliers or tissue clusters are present, the method we introduce
here is able to deal with diÔ¨Éculties inherent in working with heterogeneous cell line panels. Applying our method
to the NCI-60 panel resulted in 82 gene pairs exhibiting statistically signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerential co-expression. This is
in stark contrast with diÔ¨Äerential expression approach, which is able to detect only 1 statistically signiÔ¨Åcant gene
that diÔ¨Äers between the two groups. Together, our results show that diÔ¨Äerential co-expression is a indispensable
tool in analysing molecular patterns behind drug sensitivity, and that the proposed method is capable of leading to
new discoveries.
