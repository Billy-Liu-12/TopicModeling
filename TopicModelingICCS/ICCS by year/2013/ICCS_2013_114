Abstract
In this work, a method to estimate solid elemental sulfur solubility in pure and gas mixtures using Monte Carlo (MC)
molecular simulation is proposed. This method is based on Isobaric-Isothermal (NPT) ensemble and the Widom insertion
technique for the gas phase and a continuum model for the solid phase. This method avoids the difficulty of having to deal
with high rejection rates that are usually encountered when simulating using Gibbs ensemble. The application of this
method is tested with a system made of pure hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) and solid elemental sulfur. However, this technique
may be used for other solid-vapor systems provided the fugacity of the solid phase is known (e.g., through experimental
work). Given solid fugacity at the desired pressure and temperature, the mole fraction of the solid dissolved in gas that
would be in chemical equilibrium with the solid phase might be obtained. In other words a set of MC molecular simulation
experiments is conducted on a single box given the pressure and temperature and for different mole fractions of the solute.
The fugacity of the gas mixture is determined using the Widom insertion method and is compared with that predetermined
for the solid phase until one finds the mole fraction which achieves the required fugacity. In this work, several examples of
MC have been conducted and compared with experimental data. The Lennard-Jones parameters related to the sulfur
molecule model ( , ) have been optimized to achieve better match with the experimental work.

1. Introduction
In petroleum industry, the problem of sulfur deposition in down hole tubulars and in above surface facilities
such as gas pipelines represents a great challenge [1-3]. Sulfur, in small amounts, usually exists in sour gas,
however, with the larger volume of gas produced, considerable amounts of sulfur may deposit upon changes in

operating conditions namely pressure and/or temperature. The solubility of sulfur in sour gas is a function of
many factors including the pressure, temperature, and gas composition. In particular, the pressure represents
one of the primary factors affecting sulfur solubility. At relatively low pressures and temperatures that are
found in gas pipelines, the solubility of sulfur can be very small to measure directly. This motivated the search
for predictive techniques including molecular simulation that can predict small amounts of deposited sulfur.
The study of phase equilibrium has been extensively implemented in molecular simulation using Gibbs
ensemble [4-12] in which each phase is simulated in a separate box allowing particle interchange between the
two boxes. Apparently when one of these phases is solid this represents a great challenge as most of the
swapped particles to the solid phase box will be rejected. Swapping moves are responsible for equilibrating the
chemical potential between the two phases. Therefore, the Gibbs ensemble fails whenever such solid-vapor
equilibrium state is considered. This leaves little hope for the use of molecular simulation to investigate such an
important phenomenon. Hence, several algorithms based on molecular simulations have been introduced to
investigate systems where solid-fluid phase equilibria exist. For instance, Gibbs-Duhem integration [13, 14]
and histogram reweighting [15].
In this work, we propose another methodology in which each phase is handled separately. It is based on the
fact that, at the state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the sulfur in both phases must possess the same fugacity.
Apparently, the fugacity of sulfur in gas phase can be determined using Monte-Carlo (MC) molecular
simulation; however, for the solid phase, MC may not work. Instead it might be determined experimentally and
indeed one can find in the literature a number of correlations to evaluate the fugacity of solid elemental sulfur
at certain temperatures and pressures [16, 17]. On the other hand, only the vapor phase of the system under
interest is simulated in Isobaric-Isothermal ensemble at the desired pressures and temperatures. Several
simulations are run at the specified conditions with different mole fractions of elemental sulfur. For each
simulation, the fugacity is evaluated using the Widom insertion method [18, 19]. The mole fraction which
succeeds in achieving an equal value of fugacity as the one evaluated by the chosen correlation is taken as the
true one.
In the following sections, all the aspects and elements of the method are discussed and explained. The
methodology is introduced and then followed by the experimental work scheme used, where 4 groups of
experiments made of at least 15 simulations were conducted. The results obtained showed a good agreement
with the reproduced experimental data.
2. Methodology
2.1. Elemental Sulfur
Sulfur [20] is ranked as the second by the number of allotropes after carbon. Thus it has a complex
chemistry. It exists in polymeric species ranging from S2 to S8. However for simplicity, only S8 molecules of
sulfur were simulated where the other forms are neglected as S 8 is detected to be the dominant form in vapor
species [16].
2.2. Isobaric -Isothermal Ensemble, NPT
As have been stated earlier, only the vapor phase is to be simulated, thus only one simulation box is created.
The Isobaric-Isothermal ensemble [10] is a statistical mechanical ensemble that maintains constant temperature,
T, and constant pressure, P; where the number of particles N is preserved in the simulation box throughout the
whole simulation. Therefore it is frequently referred to as NPT ensemble.
2.3. Molecular Models
The first critical and significantly important aspect in molecular simulation is the specification of suitable
model parameters for the molecules to be simulated. Table 1 summarizes the details of the molecular models
used for S8 and H2S. For both molecules the Lennard-Jones model is adopted to evaluate dispersion-repulsion

interactions. The cutoff radius for both dispersion-repulsion and columbic interactions was taken as half of the
simulation box length.

S8 is considered as a flexible ring (Fig. 1a) while internal rotation is allowed. The intramolecular potential

However, H2S (Fig. 1b) is simulated as a rigid molecule where only rigid rotation for the whole molecule is
allowed. Therefore, in total four MC moves were performed, internal rotation for S 8 only, rigid molecular
rotation and translation for both molecules and volume change to allow pressure adjustments.

2.4. Widom Insertion Method
The method was firstly presented [19] to evaluate the chemical potential of certain pure specie or a
component in a mixture. It works by inserting a test or "ghost" molecule of the same type of the component
under interest into the simulation volume. The chemical potential is directly evaluated based on the energy
calculations of the inserted molecule due to its interaction with the surrounding ones. However, the uncertainty
of the calculation increases with dense fluids. Accuracy is improved within limits by increasing test molecules

insertions throughout the simulation. It is important to note that, these inserted molecules are performed as MC
moves during the simulation even though this move is always rejected as the number of molecules in the
simulation volume is always kept fixed.

fitting, two correlations were proposed by the same group. In our work, we considered only the most recent one

3. Experimental Work
Based on the described approach, the vapor phase will be solely simulated in a single box NPT ensemble.
To determine the solubility of solid S8 in vapor H2S at certain temperature and pressure, a group of 15
simulations were generated using MedeA software from Material Design.
Each 5 of these simulations corresponds to the same mole fraction of S8. The number of molecules of H2S
for all of the simulations was fixed to be 2000, while the number of molecules of S 8 was tuned between 5 and
20 molecules to achieve various desired mole fractions.
As the simulation box is set, the simulation was run through three stages. In the first stage, only rigid
translations and rotations were allowed for 10 million MC cycles in order to relax the molecules with in the
initial volume. In the second stage, all other moves are allowed for 15 million MC steps to allow the system to
reach equilibrium. At the last stage, the insertion move of only S8 molecules is allowed, with a probability of
around 0.6, in addition to the previous moves for 80 million MC cycles more.
The probabilities for each of the performed MC moves and the number of steps are carefully selected in
order to attain equilibrium and guarantee convergence at the lowest computational cost possible. The average
simulation time for each simulation is around 80 CPU hours using 1 Intel Xeon processor on Dell PC.
The huge number of iterations is indeed needed due to the complexity of the system under investigation. The
large number of molecules (more than 2000) used, significantly increases the time needed. Moreover, both of

Ahmad Kadoura et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2109 – 2116

the existing molecules are complex, as each S8 molecule is made of 8 L-J sites and H2S molecules require
columbic interactions evaluation.
Widom insertion method is also affected by S8molecule complexity as it is the specie to evaluate its fugacity
and it is the specie to be inserted. Therefore, to achieve the most accurate fugacity calculation, the runs has to
be long. However, and even with these long runs, the fugacities evaluated by the insertion method were in
general estimated with high uncertainties.
As a result, 5 experiments for each of the different mole fractions were run under the same temperature and
pressure, leading to the total 15 experiments to determine a point. For each of these 5 experiments, started at
the exact same conditions but with different initial molecular configuration, the average of the most accurate
fugacities was taken as the true value at the specified molar fraction and thermodynamic conditions.
4. Results and Discussion
As an application for the proposed scheme four groups of experiments were conducted to reproduce the
solubility of solid elemental sulfur in vapor H2S at 338.9 K isotherm as reported by experimental data in
literature [23]. Each of these groups is made up of at least 15 simulations and corresponds to a different
pressure at the targeted isotherm.
For each group two plots were generated, one corresponds to results obtained based on the original model
[21], and the other on a slightly modified one using B = 199.461 K instead of B = 204.461 K as it matches
the experimental data better.
In all generated plots, dots represent the most accurate fugacities of S8 in vapor phase obtained by NPT
simulations. Dotted horizontal line corresponds to the fugacity obtained by correlation at the specified
temperature and pressure. On the other hand, dotted vertical line refers to the true mole fraction expected.
Hence the intersection between these two lines determines the true expected value. The dashed line is the
average line of the chosen fugacities computed by the simulation and its intersection with the horizontal dotted
line determine the estimated mole fraction by the proposed method.
4.1. First Group (T = 338.9 K and P = 30.7 MPa)
At these thermodynamic conditions, the true value of S8solubility reported is 0.0045 mole fraction. The
calculated fugacity using correlation is 0.0451 Pa. The average line of calculated fugacities by simulation
intersects with the calculated fugacity line at 0.0049 mole fraction (Fig. 2a) when using the original model. For
repeated simulations with new model parameter, the results (Fig. 2b) were improved with an estimated mole
fraction of 0.0046.

4.2. Second Group (T = 338.9 K and P = 24.7 MPa)
In this group, the solubility reported in mole fraction is 0.0042. The calculated fugacity using correlation is
0.0344 Pa. The estimated mole fraction by original model (Fig. 3a) was 0.0065, and is significantly improved
by the modified model (Fig. 3b) to reach 0.0044 mole fraction.

Also for this group the result has improved from 116 % deviation error (Fig. 4a) to around 32 % (Fig. 4b)
with final estimated mole fraction of 0.0049.

4.4. Fourth Group (T = 338.9 K and P = 10.4 MPa)
In the final group, same procedure was repeated and the results were much improved with the optimized
parameter. The true experimental mole fraction is 0.0029 while the value obtained by the modified model (Fig.
5b) was 0.0036 and much better than the value obtained by original one (Fig. 5a).

4.5. Evaluated Fugacity at True Mole Fractions
Assuming that the true mole fraction is given, as in the case analyzed, the intersection of the fugacity
average line obtained by simulation with the dotted vertical line corresponds to the fugacity value by simulation
at the true fraction. The fugacities at true molar fractions for the 8 cases presented earlier were plotted (Fig. 6)
against the fugacity values evaluated by the correlation. In theory, at the true molar fraction the two fugacities
should be equal; however a deviation is detected with much less significance when B was changed.
According to the plot, even though the error is small (no more than15% when model was optimized) while
estimating fugacities, the simulation results for solubility were worse. This sensitivity to fugacity changes can
be explained by the low solubility profiles we are trying to estimate.

5. Conclusion
Monte Carlo molecular simulation has been used in this work to estimate the solubility of elemental sulfur in
H2S gas. The fugacity of pure solid elemental sulfur was determined based on an experimentally developed
correlation [17]. The fugacity of elemental sulfur in H2S gas was evaluated using Widom insertion in an NPT
ensemble simulation. The solubility of elemental sulfur in H2S was determined as the fugacities of each phase
are equated.
The results obtained, proved that indeed this approach could potentially be employed to estimate the
solubility of solid species in vapor phase by avoiding particle insertions to the dense solid phase. In addition, S8
molecule parameters as needed by molecular simulation were optimized to match best the experimental data.
