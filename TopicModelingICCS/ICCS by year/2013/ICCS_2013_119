Abstract
Because compositional data have a series of complicated mathematical characteristics such as constant sum constraints, the
usage of traditional statistical analysis methods in analyzing compositional data will usually cause difficulties. This paper
focuses on the approach to measure the correlation of compositional data. Since the algorithm of correlation coefficient of
common data is not adaptive to multi-variables data, and traditional canonical correlation analysis cannot be directly
applied to compositional data, two kinds of approaches are presented which are based on logratio transformation and
centered logratio transformation separately, combined with canonical correlation analysis, and succeeds in computing
correlation coefficient of compositional data.

1. Introduction
Compositional data is commonly used to reflect the structure of objects[1], and usually described by the pie
chart. This type of data must satisfy the constraint that the sum of all components should be one, which is
called “constant sum constraint”.
In 1897 Pearson firstly discussed spurious correlation in an authoritative paper and he pointed that
attempting to explain the relationship among those proportions which contain same parts in numerator and
denominator is hazardous [2]. From then on, more and more scientists and statisticians realized the difficulties
that analyzing compositional data using classical multivariable analysis would cause mistakes and some
concepts could not be explained precisely. Until 1986 ”The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data” written
by Aitchison was published, which was generally acknowledged as the first theoretic work studying
compositional data[3]. This book discussed some special difficulties about the analysis of compositional data,

such as high-dimension problem, covariance lacking of explanatory and so on. And it succeeded introducing a
new statistical method which was designed for compositional data specially. For dealing with the problems in
analyzing compositional data, Aitchison found out the logarithm of the ratio of its components which are
characters never compressed by closure effect. The study of compositional data involves the relative quantity
rather than absolute quantity. Thus, we analyze problems with proportions and the logarithm would simplify
the covariance matrix. By changing compositional data into the logarithm of the ratio of its components (the
ranges of the logarithm of ratios is the whole set of real number, not the simplex space), and applying the
transformed data by traditional statistical techniques, a series of problems in compositional data analysis have
been successfully solved.
However, the analytical system of compositional data is far from perfect and many problems are still not
solved well today such as correlation analysis. The author proposed an approach to compute correlation
coefficient of compositional data based on logratio transformation and solved the problem successfully [4].
However dimensionality reduction is inevitable since logratio transformation is performed to the compositional
data, and as a result, the interpretability will be reduced during the process of modeling. Here the meaning of
canonical variable abstracted from the canonical correlation analysis based on the transformed data is uncertain.
Therefore in this paper, the author proposes a new method of correlation coefficient based on centered logratio
transformation to improve the interpretability of the model. As the case study, this paper uses the two methods
calculating the correlation coefficient of Chinese industrial structure and employment structure, and find that
the results of these two methods incline to equivalent despite the differences in the calculation process.
2. Computing correlation coefficient of compositional data
The compositional data with D elements is defined as a vector X
two constraints:

D

x j =1 ;

0

xj

x1 ,..., xD

R D , where it satisfies the

D.

j 1

We can get xD

since

D

D 1 , and therefore the rank of compositional

data with D dimensionalities is d .
2.1. Method 1: Based on logratio transformation
The author proposed a method to compute correlation coefficient of compositional data based on logratio
transformation in 2008. The basic idea is to perform logration transformation to the components. That is, the
compositional data with D elements, written as X
D 1 elements, written as X

x1 ,..., x D

1

x1 ,..., xD

R D , can be transformed into data with

, according to the following logratio transformation function

xi
, i 1,..., D 1
(1)
xD
Obviously, logratio transformation has eliminated the influence of constant sum constraint of original
compositional data, and the components of transformed data can be varied in the interval - + .
Further we build a canonical correlation analysis model. Canonical correlation analysis aims to reflect a
high-dimensional relationship between two sets of random variables by a few pair of abstracted canonical
variables. Given random vector X and Y , introducing a pair of coefficient vector a and b , we construct the
functions U a X and V b Y . Evidently, U is the linear combination of X and V is the linear combination

of Y [5,6]. The correlation between the pair of canonical variables U and V which have unit variance is called
the canonical correlation.
We intend to seek a pair of coefficient vector a and b so that the correlation between the pair of canonical
variables is the maximum. Then seek another pair of coefficient vector among all choices that are irrelevent
with the first pair of canonical variables, which maximize the correlation. Here exclude the part which has been
interpreted by the first pair of canonical variables. Seek for another pair of canonical variables which can
r , then at most we can have r pairs of
interpret the part that remains. Suppose Cov U ,V

The correlation of U and V can be written as

2.2. Method 2: Based on centered logratio transformation
The method 1 based on logratio transformation has eliminated the redundant dimension of the original
compositional data. However dimensionality reduction also changed the physical meaning of the new variable,
causing poor interpretability during canonical correlation analysis. Therefore a new method based on centered
logratio transformation is proposed.
The compositional data with D elements, written as X
with D elements, written as X

x1 ,..., x D

by centered logratio transformation. The transformation function

The usage of centered logratio transformation to the analysis variable offered convenience in many fields.
The transformation not only maintains the advantages of logratio transformation, but also has better reflection
to component characteristics and interpretability of the model due to the vector transformed still keep the
original dimensions and is centered in every component.
For compositional data X
logratio transformation.

x1 ,..., x p and Y

3. Case: correlation analysis of Chinese industrial structure and employment structure

Based on GDP and employment data of 31 Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in
2010, we analyze the correlation of GDP structure and employment structure, which are commonly categorized
into primary, second and tertiary industry.
The data preprocessed by logratio transformation and centered logratio transformation separately are listed
in table 1. We can see the dimension of data preprocessed by centered lorgitio transformation still keeps 3,
while the one by logratio transformation has been reduced to 2.

From the results of the two methods, we find an interesting phenomenon that the results incline to the same
though the calculation processes are different. The phenomenon infers that there probably exists some internal
linkage between these two methods. We’ll try to explain it in the future work and perform more mathematical
deduction to compare these two methods. In fact, we have already obtained some preliminary conclusions and
the specific details are in progress. However, it does not affect the solution of correlation on composition data
by these methods.
Though these two methods, we take the first canonical correlation coefficient to measure the correlation of
industrial structure and employment structure that is 0.9463, which means the industrial structure is high
positive correlation with the employment structure.
4. Conclusion and future work

Compositional data is widely used in many aspects of social life. With development of the research, more
and more difficulties in the theoretical analysis and application of compositional data have been exposed.
Researchers have developed a series of analytical techniques to analyse compositional data; but these methods
and theories are still not complete till now. This paper discussed the problem how to measure the correlation of
compositional data. Two approaches are proposed which are based on logratio transformation and centered
logratio transformation separately, combined with canonical correlation analysis. The methods succeed in
solving the problem of computing correlation coefficient of compositional data, and are able to be executed on
Matlab. The application of Chinese economy has verified the feasibility and validity of the proposed methods.
In this paper, two ways are employed into calculating correlation coefficient of compositional data, yet we
get the same results. We speculate that it has some relationship between the two methods. In the future work,
we’ll research this problem in depth and try to explain it. On the other hand, these two different kinds of
methods proposed in the paper are both based on canonical correlation analysis that is a classical method,
which have been tested effective through many practices and suit for most common data. But when observed
object comes to large scale data, it may cause some difficulty since the current algorithm is on the basis of
inverse matrix. Therefore, further studies on the correlation coefficient on large scale compositional data are
necessary.
