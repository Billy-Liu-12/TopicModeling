Abstract
An advanced method, which we call Monte Carlo-COS method, is proposed for computing the counterparty credit exposure
proﬁle of Bermudan options under L´evy process. The diﬀerent exposure proﬁles and exercise intensity under diﬀerent measures, P and Q, are discussed. Since the COS method [1] delivers accurate Bermudan prices, and no change of measure [2]
needed to get the P-probability distribution, the exposure proﬁle produced by the Monte Carlo-COS algorithm can be used
as a benchmark result, E.g., to analyse the reliability of the popular American Monte Carlo method [3, 4, 5]. The eﬃcient
calculation of expected exposure (EE) [6] can be further applied to the computation of credit value adjustment (CVA) [6].
Keywords: counterparty credit risk, Monte Carlo-COS method, Bermudan option, L´evy process, American Monte Carlo

1. Introduction
The computation of counterparty credit exposure of exotic instruments with no analytical solution is a challenging problem. According to Basel II and Basel III, counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty in a
derivatives transaction will default prior to the expiration of the instrument and will not therefore make the current
and future payments required by the contract. For quantiﬁcation of counterparty credit risk of exotic instruments
with no analytical solution, such as calculation of potential future exposure (PFE), expected exposure (EE), and
credit value adjustment (CVA), an eﬃcient computation method for counterparty credit exposure is required.
In this paper, we propose an advanced approach, which we call Monte Carlo-COS method (MCCOS), to
give an accurate result of the exposure proﬁle (See deﬁnition 2.4) of a single asset Bermudan option under L´evy
process. Diﬀerent from the American Monte Carlo method1 [3, 4, 5], in the Monte Carlo-COS method, one can
calculate the exposure proﬁle without using any change of measure. Combined with the computational advantage
of COS method on accuracy and speed of option pricing, the exposure proﬁle produced by the Monte Carlo-COS
method can serve as a “benchmark” for analysing the reliability of the American Monte Carlo method.
The literature on the subject is quite rich. Canabarro and Duﬃe [7] and Duﬃe and Singleton [8] discuss
techniques for measuring and pricing counterparty credit risk; Lomibao and Zhu [9] present a “direct jump to

simulation date” method, and derive analytic expressions to calculate the exposure on a number of path-dependent
instruments, except Bermudan option and American option; In Pykhtin and Zhu [10, 11], the modeling framework
for counterparty credit exposure is proposed.
Based on this modeling framework, the American Monte carlo method is proposed for exposure calculation
in some literatures. In Sch¨oftner [5] a modiﬁed least squares Monte Carlo algorithm is applied; Cesari [4] combines the bundling technique [12] with Longstaﬀ-Schwartz method for exposure calculation; Ng [13] applies the
stochastic mesh method to the credit exposure calculation. However, the exposure distribution under real-world
measure P is not presented.
The paper is structured in the following way. Section 2 provides the deﬁnition of the exposure proﬁles of
counterparty credit exposure, and describes the modeling approach for exposure calculation of exotic options.
Section 3 shows the connection between dynamic programming and exposure calculation. Section 4 explains the
application of Monte Carlo-COS method to get a benchmark result for the Bermudan option. Section 5 gives
the numerical experiments and analyses the diﬀerence of exposure proﬁle and exercise intensity under diﬀerent
measures. Section 6 concludes the presented approach to calculate the exposure proﬁles.
2. Option Price Distribution and Counterparty Credit Exposure
In this section, we give the deﬁnition of counterparty credit exposure and introduce the modeling framework
for calculation of exposure proﬁle of exotic options.
2.1. Exposure deﬁnition
Let (Ω, F , P) be a probability space, let T be a ﬁxed positive number, and let Ft , 0 ≤ t ≤ T , be a ﬁltration of
sub-σ-algebras of F . We deﬁne the value of a derivative security under the risk-neutral measure Q [14] over time
as a stochastic process V(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , which is driven by the stochastic process of risk factors X(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,
such as stock prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates[6]. We call (t, X(t)) the state of the economy at time
t. Denote the derivative’s discounted net cashﬂow between t and T as C AS HFLOWS (t, T ) (i.e., all of the cashﬂows
are discounted back to time t), then V(t) = EQ C AS HFLOWS (t, T )|Ft . We use the notation from [6] and give the
deﬁnition of counterparty credit risk measures as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.1. The credit exposure, Et , of a derivative security at time t to a counterparty is deﬁned as the
non-negative value of the risk-neutral expected discounted value of future cashﬂows, i.e.,
Et = max(V(t), 0) = V(t)+ , 0 ≤ t ≤ T

(1)

Deﬁnition 2.2. The potential future exposure (PFE) at time t as seen from time zero is deﬁned as
PFEα,t = in f {x : P(Et ≤ x) ≥ α)}, 0 ≤ t ≤ T

(2)

where α is the given conﬁdence level, and P is the real-world measure.
Deﬁnition 2.3. The expected exposure (EE) at time t as seen from time zero, which is used in computing credit
value adjustment (CVA), is given by:
EEt = EP Et , 0 ≤ t ≤ T
(3)
here the expectation is taken under the real-world measure P.
Deﬁnition 2.4. The exposure proﬁle of counterparty credit exposure is deﬁned as the the graph of PFE α,t or EEt ,
as a function of t.

2.2. Exposure valuation: the modeling framework
The main problem to calculate PFEα,t in (2) and EEt in (3) is to calculate the probability distribution of Et (or
V(t)) under the real-world measure P. The exact probability distribution, which usually has no explicit solution,
can be approximated by an empirical distribution of the sample results of Et (or V(t)) on each simulated state
(t, X(t)).
Assuming one has a model describing the stochastic process of risk factors X(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T , which is already
calibrated to the market data at time zero, then two basic steps are involved in the modelling framework [3, 4]:
1. Simulate the model under the real-world measure P (i.e., the market price of risk has to be incorporated into
the model) to get the scenarios of risk factors X(t), t ∈ [0, T ], see ﬁgure 1.
2. Calculate the option price for every simulated state (t, X(t)), under the risk-neutral measure Q. The option
can be seen as a newly issued one from the future state (t, X(t)), with time to maturity T − t.
3. Dynamic Programming and Exposure Calculation
In contrast to European options, which can only be exercised at maturity, a Bermudan option can be exercised
at a ﬁxed set of exercise opportunities, T = {t1 , ..., t M },0 = t0 ≤ t1 , t M = T . Assume the exercise dates are equally
spaced, i.e., ti − ti−1 = Δt, i = 1, ...M. If the option is exercised at ti , the option holder gets the exercise value
h(ti , S ti ).
To determine V0 (S 0 ), the Bermudan option value at initial time 0, with initial stock price S 0 , one needs to
solve the following dynamic programming recursion:
V M (S M )

=

max(h(t M , S M ), 0)

c(t0 , S 0 )

(7)

1166

Yanbin Shen et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 1163 – 1171

where we use the simpliﬁed notation Xm for Xtm . we assume a constant interest rate r, so exp(−rΔt) denotes
the discount factor for time interval Δt. c is the continuation value of the option and V the value of the option
immediately before the exercise opportunity. As indicated in (4), the continuation value c at terminal time t M
equals 0.
Note that t0 is not included in the exercise dates. If one issues a new Bermudan option from an intermediate
state (tm−1 , S m−1 ), with possible exercise dates [tm , ..., t M ] (Here tm−1 is not an exercise date.), then the price of this
new option is equal to the continuation value c(tm−1 , S m−1 ) in (5) [15]. Based on this observation, we can calculate
the credit exposure for each exercise date, T = {t1 , ..., t M }, as a by-product of the option pricing procedure, which
therefore yields estimated distributions of credit exposure, on each possible exercise date.
In an ordinary option pricing procedure of American Monte Carlo method, such as LSM, the stock price S t is
usually simulated under the risk-neutral measure Q. However, in risk management, industries are more interested
in values under the real-world measure P, i.e., asset price processes evolve in the real-world measure P. In [4, 5],
the authors use the change of measure method to get the P-distribution. In contrast to the American Monte Carlo
method used in [4, 5], in the Monte Carlo-COS method, one can eﬃciently compute the option prices on all
the grid points which are simulated under measure P, without using any change of measure. The algorithm is
explained in the following section.
4. A Benchmark Approach: The Monte Carlo-COS Method
The Monte Carlo-COS method is based on the work of [4, 1]. We assume the underlying stochastic process is
a L´evy process.
For a Bermudan option, regression-based approximation methods, such as the LSM method, are used to approximate the following conditional expectation on possible exercise dates:
c(tm−1 , S m−1 (p)) = exp(−rΔt)EQ Vm (S m )|Ftm−1 ,

(8)

with p = 1, ..., P the simulated sample paths. If we deﬁne x = log S m−1 (p)/K , y = log S m /K , with K the strike
price, and denote Vt (y) = Vt (K exp(y)) = Vt (S t ), then it can be represented as,
c(tm−1 , x) = exp(−rΔt)EQ Vm (y)|x = exp(−rΔt)

R

Vm (y) f (y|x)dy,

(9)

where f (y|x) is the probability density function of y given x under risk-neutral measure Q.
An alternative way for eﬃcient calculation of (9) is by numerical integration, particularly we choose the COS
method developed in [1] as the main component of our algorithm.
Diﬀerent from the option pricing problem in [1], for the exposure proﬁle problem, the option price on every
grid point simulated under measure P has to be calculated. And the early exercise event has to be taken into
account for each simulated path, since the option price should be ﬂoored to zero after exercise event happens.
This is done by ﬁnding the earliest exercise time, τ p , for each path p and set the value after τ p into zero.
There are three main components in the Monte Carlo-COS method for exposure proﬁle calculation:
1. Scenario generation for the future economic state under measure P;
2. Instrument valuation of all the simulated grid points by COS method;
3. Exposure proﬁle calculation.
4.1. Fourier cosine expansion
In this section, we explain the COS method for instrument valuation of all the simulated grid points. The
following proposition[1] gives another representation of (9), based on Fourier cosine expansion:
Proposition 4.1. Let the underlying stochastic process of stock price S t be L´evy process, then the continuation
value at grid point (tm−1 , S m−1 (p)), c(tm−1 , S m−1 (p)), can be approximated by,

where ϕlevy (ω; Δt) = φlevy (ω; 0, Δt), and φlevy is the characteristic function of L´evy process. Vk (tm ) is the Fouriercosine series coeﬃcients of Vm (y) on [a, b],
Vk (tm ) =

Here [a, b] is the truncation rage of the integration of risk-neutral evaluation formula in (9). c(tm−1 , S m−1 (p)) is
equivalent to the value of Bermudan option newly issued at grid point (tm−1 , S m−1 (p)), with maturity time t M and
possible exercise dates, tm , ..., t M .
Proof. The main proof can be found in [1].
4.2. Recovery of Vk (tm )
To compute (10), one needs to know the Fourier cosine coeﬃcients, Vk (tm ), given in (11). The derivation of an
induction formula for Vk (tm ) of Bermudan option, backwards in time, was the basis of the work in [1]. It is brieﬂy
explained here.
First, the early exercise point, x∗ (tm ), at time tm , which is the point where the continuation value equals the
payoﬀ, i.e., c(x∗ (tm ), tm ) = g(x∗ (tm )), is determined by Newton’s method.
Second, based on x∗ (tm ), Vk (tm ) is split into two parts: one on the interval [a, x∗ (tm )], and another on (x∗ (tm ), b],
i.e.,
Vk (tm )=

Ck (a, x∗ (tm ), tm ) + Gk (x∗ (tm ), b), call,
Gk (a, x∗ (tm )) + Ck (x∗ (tm ), b, tm ), put,

for m = M − 1, ..., 1, and at t M = T ,
Vk (t M )=

Gk (x∗ (0, b), call,
Gk (x∗ (a, 0), put.

Here Ck and Gk are the Fourier coeﬃcients for the continuation value and payoﬀ function, respectively, which
read,
Gk (x1 , x2 ) =

For k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1 and m = 1, 2, ..., M, Gk (x1 , x2 ) has analytical solution, and the challenge is to compute the
Ck eﬃciently. The following proposition from [1] claims that Ck (x1 , x2 , tm ), k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, can be recovered
from Vl (tm+1 ), l = 0, 1, ..., N − 1.
Proposition 4.2. For m = M, Vk (x1 , x2 , tm ) (and Ck (x1 , x2 , tm )) has analytical solution; for m = M − 1, ..., 1,
Gk (x1 , x2 ) has analytical solution, and Ck (x1 , x2 , tm ) can be approximated by Ck (x1 , x2 , tm ), i.e.,

and i = −1 being the imaginary unit. Vl (tm+1 ) is the approximation of Vl (tm+1 ) by replacing Ck (x1 , x2 , tm+1 ) with

4.3. Application for exposure calculation
Denote the truncation interval for grid point (tm−1 , S m−1 (p)) by [am−1,p , bm−1,p ], m = 1, ..., M, p = 1, ..., P,
where
am−1,p = ξ1 − L ξ2 +

ξ4 + log S m−1 (p)/K

bm−1,p = ξ1 + L ξ2 +

ξ4 + log S m−1 (p)/K

with L ∈ [6, 12] depending on a user-deﬁned tolerance level, TOL, and ξ1 , ..., ξ4 being the cumulants of L´evy
process2 , with time interval Δt. The error in the pricing formula connected to the size of the domain decreases
exponentially with L, and in most cases, as shown in [1], with L = 10 the option price converges well for most
L´evy processes.
The common truncation interval for all the grid points is chosen as [a, b] in the following way,
a = min{am−1,p : m = 1, ..., M, p = 1, ..., P},
b = max{bm−1,p : m = 1, ..., M, p = 1, ..., P}.
Consider the sample vector at time tm−1 ,
SVm−1 = [S m−1 (1), ..., S m−1(P)].
For a vector xvm−1 = [log S m−1 (1)/K , ..., log S m−1 (P)/K ], the COS formula (10) can be written as a vector
form,
N−1

cˆ (tm−1 , xvm−1 ) = exp(−rΔt)

Re{ϕlevy
k=0

kπ
xvm−1 − a
; Δt exp(−ikπ
)}Vk (tm )

b−a

(12)

which is particularly useful for exposure calculation of all the grid points in a sample vector.
According to the proposition (4.2), for the case of L´evy process, the Fourier cosine coeﬃcients, Vk (tm ), k =
0, 1, ..., N − 1, can be recovered from Vl (tm+1 ), l = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, without knowing the option price for each time
step. Once the Fourier cosine coeﬃcients for each time step is calculated, one just inserts them into formula (12)
to get the continuation value (or the Bermudan option price) of all the grid points, i.e., cˆ (tm−1 , xvm−1 ).
4.4. The Monte Carlo-COS algorithm
We list the Monte Carlo-COS algorithm for exposure proﬁle calculation of Bermudan option as follows,
1. Simulate P paths for the stock price, S t , under the real-world measure P.
2. Calculate the common truncation interval for all of the simulated grid points, [a, b].
3. For each time step, calculate the Fourier cosine coeﬃcients, Vk (tm ), k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, m = 1, ..., M.
4. At terminal date t M = T , set
V M (S M (p)) = max(h(t M , S M (p)), 0)
for p = 1, ..., P, and deﬁne the stopping time τ M = T .
5. Apply backward induction, i.e., m → m − 1 for m = M, ..., 1,
(a) Calculate the continuation value, cˆ (tm−1 , S m−1 (p)), by inserting the Fourier cosine coeﬃcients into
formula (12).
(b) Deﬁne a new stopping time according to the stopping rule for Bermudan option,
p

τm−1 = min{k ∈ {m − 1, ..., M}|h(tk, S k (p)) ≥ c(tk , S k (p))}
2 For example, if the stochastic process is geometric Brownian motion, then ξ = (μ− 1 σ2 )Δt, ξ = σ2 Δt, ξ = 0, with μ the drift coeﬃcient,

and σ the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

8. The measure P-exposure proﬁles of PFEα,tm and EEα,tm can be calculated directly by the empirical distribution of Etpm . Since the scenario is simulated under measure P, no change of measure needed.
Remark 4.1. Once the COS method is extended into the 2 dimension case [16] or more, the MCCOS algorithm
can be extended straightforwardly into the multi-asset case.
5. Numerical Experiments: Exposure Proﬁles under Diﬀerent Measures
In this section, we investigate the diﬀerence between the exposure proﬁles calculated under diﬀerent measures,
i.e., Q and P. For comparison, we take the same parameters as in [5] for the Bermudan option, with initial price
S 0 = 100, strike price K = 100, constant interest rate r = 0.05, real world drift μ = 0.1, volatility σ = 0.2 and 50
exercise dates. The underlying stochastic process is geometric Brownian motion process (GBM). We take 18, 000
paths and 50 time steps for the underlying value. Only the exposures on possible exercise dates are considered.

We investigate the exposure proﬁles calculated under diﬀerent measures by two settings:
1. Q-exposure proﬁle, i.e., the stock prices are simulated under measure Q. The exposure proﬁles are obtained
based on the Q-probability distribution of credit exposure.

2. P-exposure proﬁle, i.e., the stock prices are simulated under measure P. The exposure proﬁles are obtained
based on the P-probability distribution of credit exposure.
The diﬀerence between Q-exposure proﬁle and P-exposure proﬁle is illustrated in ﬁgure 2. Note that in this
parameter setting, μ > r, and we ﬁnd the P-exposure proﬁles are lower than Q-exposure proﬁles. The initial prices
V0 for both settings coincide, because the risk-neutral pricing formula is independent of diﬀerent measures.
When μ > r, at each time step t, the stock price S t simulated under measure P tends to be higher than S t
simulated under measure Q. For a Bermudan put option issued at time t, with maturity T and initial stock price
S t , a higher initial stock price S t (i.e., simulated under measure P) leads to a lower option price, thus a lower
P-exposure proﬁle.
Table 1 provides the number of expected exposure calculated under diﬀerent measures, which can be further
applied to computation of credit value adjustment (CVA).
Figure 3 shows the percentage of paths that have already been exercised at time t. In the example, the exercise
intensity under measure Q is higher than that under measure P. This signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the future exposure
values, since after exercise, the contract does not exist any more and exposure is ﬂoored to zero.
Although it is exercised more often under measure Q than that under measure P (ﬁgure 3), the Q-exposure
proﬁle is still higher than the P-exposure proﬁle (ﬁgure 2).
6. Conclusion
This paper proposes an advanced method, named Monte Carlo-COS method to calculate the exposure proﬁle
of single asset Bermudan options that has no analytical solution, under L´evy process. The result can serve as a
benchmark for analysing the error in American Monte Carlo method [3, 4, 5]. The diﬀerence of exposure proﬁles
and exercise intensity under diﬀerent measures(i.e., P and Q) is also discussed.
