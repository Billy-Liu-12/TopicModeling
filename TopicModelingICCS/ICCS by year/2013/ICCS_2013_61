Abstract
Preferential Attachment (PA), which was originally proposed in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) Model, has been widely accepted as a network growth model which returns in scale-free networks. Preferential attachment in the BA model operates
on the assumption that a node which has more links has a better likelihood to create new links. In this work, we expand the
PA mechanism by treating it as a cyclic mechanism which is linked to both direct and indirect neighbours of a node. The
assumption behind this extension is that the preference of nodes is inﬂuenced by their indirect neighbours as well. We show
that traditional PA can be absorbed as a special case of this new growth model, which we name ‘cyclic preferential attachment’
(CPA). We also discuss the properties of simulated networks that were generated based on CPA. Finally, we compare and
contrast the CPA based networks with the traditional PA based networks and several real-world networks of similar sizes and
link-to-node ratios, and show that CPA oﬀers more ﬂexibility in modeling real world networks.

1. Introduction
Many distributed systems can be modelled as complex networks, including systems in the social, biological,
technical and ecological domains [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and [9]. These networks share many underlying structural properties, including scale-free nature, and small world architecture. Analysing the structure and
function of such complex networks has developed into a dominant trend in scientiﬁc research in the past decade.
Particularly, a number of network growth models have been proposed to model the evolutionary processes that
govern the development of these networks [10, 1, 4].
Ever since Barabasi-Albert introduced Preferential Attachment (PA) [11] network growth model, it has been
widely accepted as a dominant model to synthesize scale-free networks. Scale-free networks are the networks that
show a power-law degree distribution [12], and many real world networks have been shown to have the scale-free
behaviour [12], thus making PA very relevant in Complex Network analysis. In the classical interpretation of
preferential attachment, the probability of a node creating a new link is proportional to its degree.
Subsequently, myriad variations of preferential attachment have been suggested. Examples of such variations
include the application of preferential attachment in growing spatial networks [13], local preferential attachment

for hierarchical networks [14] and betweenness based preferential attachment [15]. These variations primarily
arise from the metrics used to quantify the preference of a particular node towards another within the network.
What is common to most of these variations however, is the assumption that a node’s likelihood of preference is
tied to a topological property of itself, such as its degree or betweenness. In this work, we take a fundamentally
diﬀerent approach in modelling PA. We argue that a node’s likelihood of preference to some extent depends on
the entire topology of the network, and all indirect neighbours inﬂuence it, proportional to their distance from the
node concerned. Therefore, preferential attachment is directly dependent on a node’s neighbours, but indirectly
dependent on their neighbours, and their neighbours etc, hence the term cyclic preferential attachment (CPA).
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In the next section, we describe classical PA in more detail,
and describe some related concepts. In the following section we introduce and justify the formulation of Cyclic
Preferential Attachment. In the next section we use CPA to model some real world networks, and compare them
to the classical PA models, and demonstrate the ﬂexibility in the parameter space that the CPA is able to oﬀer. In
the ﬁnal section we present our conclusions and discuss future work.
2. Background
According to the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, growth and preferential attachment have been identiﬁed as
the two key drivers of network evolution [12]. Out of those two, in this work, we are mainly interested in the
preferential attachment behaviour of the nodes in a network.
Preferential attachment hypothises that a node in a network is more inclined to connect with other nodes that
are more ‘connected’ within the network. Within the context of network topology, this ‘connectedness’ is usually
measured by node degree (the number of links a node has).
When developing a model for network growth based on PA using the node degree, the probability of a node
attracting a new link is regarded as proportional to its degree. If Pi is the probability that the node i would attract
a new link and di is the degree of the node i, PA suggests that;
Pi ∝ d i

(1)

When using PA to generate a network, the probability that a node would attract a new link depends on its
immediate neighbours alone. In other words, the preferential attachment is not aﬀected by the number of the
node’s second level neighbours. Each node within the network would have some probability of attracting a new
node based on its individual degree. This is an important property of the PA that we would like to stress upon, as
we will be taking a diﬀerent approach when measuring the cyclic preferential attachment.
Meanwhile, Assortativity [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] has been identiﬁed as a feature of many real world networks.
Assortativity is the tendency of nodes to connect with similar nodes. The similarity can be measured using any
property. However, as with preferential attachment, assortativity too is often measured by degree similarity.
The BA model however, does not produce networks with a certain level of assortativity [16]. Thus, preferential
attachment and assortativity seem to be quite disjoint properties in node behaviour. There have been several attempts to combine these two features into a common model. Examples of such attemps are assortative preferential
attachment in scale-free networks [21] and using a combination of traditional PA and assortative mixing in two
stages to model a network [22]. However, there isn’t still a broad consensus on how the networks that show scalefree behaviour, which can be modelled quite accurately with the preferential attachment, can still demonstrate
assortative mixing.
Similarly, there are a number of other topological features, such as modularity, community structure, network
diameter and average shortest path length, which the PA model cannot capture fully because it does not have
suﬃcient parameters. Our goal in proposing the Cyclic Preferential Attachment therefore is to demonstrate a
preferential attachment-based generic growth model, which can suﬃciently capture the diversity in scale-free
network structure by allowing more ﬂexibility in the parameter space in terms of topology.
3. Cyclic Preferential Attachment (CPA)
To justify the introduction of the CPA, let us consider an online social network such as Facebook or Google+,
where preferential attachment typically occurs. In such a network, a person is more likely to choose another person

2088

Dharshana Kasthurirathna and Mahendra Piraveenan / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2086 – 2094

as a friend if that person already has a high number of friends. The reason for this is that, by being connected to
an inﬂuential person with high degree, the person who is making links is hoping to obtain maximum mileage for
their links. This is also the case in a number of other real world networks, such as corporate networks, networks
of academics, actor networks etc, where a persons’ inﬂuence is to some extend indicated by the number of friends
she/he has. However, if two people had equal number of friends, would a joining person not consider who those
friends are? Would a joining person then consider the degrees of the friends of the potential friend, to assess
the second order of inﬂuence to be potentially gained? Indeed, would all orders of inﬂuence, up to the farthest
neighbours, not be considered, to various levels, in making preferential links? This is the motivation behind our
proposed Cyclic Preferential Attachment.
In the Cyclic Preferential Attachment (CPA) model, each node’s likelihood for preferential attachment would
depend not only on its own degree but also on the degrees of all the other nodes within the network. The contribution by the rest of the nodes, therefore, would be inversely proportional to the distance to each of those nodes
from the node in concern. Thus, all nodes would contribute to the likelihood of preference of a particular node.
To demonstrate the above hypothesis, let’s consider a friendship network. Fig. 1 shows a topological pattern
that could occur in a Friendship network.

Fig. 1. Cyclic Preferential Attachment in Friendship Networks. CPA suggests that node A would have a higher probability of attracting node
X (even though both node A and B have the same degree), since node A is connected to node P, which has a higher degree.

Suppose node P is a very inﬂuential and highly connected member of the society/network. Node Q is more
modest when it comes to its degree. Let’s also assume that node A and B are connected to P and Q respectively
and A and B have equal degree. If another node X would have the opportunity to connect to either A and B, which
node it would choose? The underlying assumption of CPA is that A has the higher probability of attracting node
X, simply because A is connected to a node B that has a higher degree. This argument ﬁts well with friendship
networks, where individuals are identiﬁed for preference not just by the number of connections they have but also
by the fact ‘who’ their neighbours are. The individuals who have more inﬂuential friends would have a better
chance of making new friends, even if their degree may not be considerably high. We use the term ‘cyclic’ to
denote the notion that a node’s own likelihood of preference would be cyclically inﬂuenced by the degrees of its
indirect neighbours as well.
Moreover, in friendship networks there are certain connections that are formed merely to gain indirect access
to a more inﬂuential member [23]. The CPA model would facilitate this scenario, that being a neighbour of a more
connected member ‘induces’ a certain amount of preferential attraction on a node, regardless of it’s own degree.
If we apply the same argument to social networks in general and other complex networks, it is possible to argue
that a node’s degree aﬀects the preferential attractiveness of its immediate neighbours and even the nodes that are
connected over several hops.
When calculating the CPA based probability of attracting a new link, we take into account the contributions
from all the nodes within the network. The particular node we are considering would make the highest contribution
to its own CPA based probability while the other nodes would contribute depending on their distances from it,
along the shortest paths. We use the degree of the node as the quantifying parameter of CPA just like in the case

Dharshana Kasthurirathna and Mahendra Piraveenan / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2086 – 2094

of PA.
Thus, we can represent the probability of a node making a new link under CPA with the following Mathematical expression.
n

Pi ∝

C li j ∗ d j

(2)

j=0

Here, Pi is the probability of the node i making a new link under cyclic preferential attachment. C is a network
speciﬁc parameter that we call the CPA coeﬃcient. This coeﬃcient has a value between 0 and 1 and determines
in what proportion the nodes within the network would contribute to the CPA of node i, compared to i itself. li j is
the distance along the shortest path from the node i to each node j. Thus, the further the node j from node i, the
smaller would be node j’s contribution to the total probability. C li j is then multiplied by the degree of the node j
(denoted by d j ), to obtain the contribution to the CPA of node i by node j. This would be performed for all the
nodes within the network to get the cumulative probability value. In case of the node i itself, li j would be 0 thus
its contribution to the cumulative probability would be proportional to its degree, as in the case of traditional PA.
Fig. 2 demonstrates how the CPA of a particular node A would be computed. Each of its neighbour’s contribution to the probability of A making a new link would be proportional to their respective degrees multiplied by
C to the power of their distance from A.

Fig. 2. Computing the CPA of node X0 . Each node Xi ’s contribution PXi X0 to node X0 ’s probability of attracting a new link is proportional to
node Xi ’s degree multiplied by CPA coeﬃcient (C) to the power of Xi ’s distance from X0 .

Hence, the equation 3 would give the cumulative probability of attracting a new link for the node X0 .
PX0 = PX0 X0 + PX1 X0 + PX2 X0 + PX3 X0 + PX4 X0 ....

(3)

If C is equal to zero, the value of C li j would be 1 for the node X0 (since 00 = 1), and 0 for all other nodes, as
the 0th power of 0 is equal to one. Therefore, when C is 0, CPA reduces itself to PA, as only the particular node’s
degree would be considered for the probability calculation. Thus, PA can be regarded as a special case of the CPA,
which occurs when C is equal to 0.
4. Characteristics of CPA based Networks
In this section, we further analyse the features of CPA generated networks. Table 1 contains a set of structural
properties of networks, such as the diameter, clustering coeﬃcient and assortativity, calculated upon several networks that were generated based on CPA. The networks were generated with varying CPA coeﬃcient(C) values
under diﬀerent link-to-node ratios. All the simulated networks were of the size 1000 nodes each.

From the properties of the simulated networks, it is evident that by varying C, we can obtain networks with
diﬀerent characteristics. The networks generated based on CPA can be manipulated using the CPA coeﬃcient
(C). The CPA coeﬃcient can be thought of as an indicator of the ‘cyclic-nature’ of the network. The higher the
CPA coeﬃcient, the more contribution that the rest of the nodes would make for a particular node’s probability
of attracting a new link. Therefore, this coeﬃcient C introduces an additional parameter (in addition to the usual
parameter that is used in traditional PA to make the proportionality an equation), and this parameter could be used
to generate scale-free networks with varying topological features (such as assortativity and modularity), which
traditional PA cannot do.
As with PA, CPA too gives rise to scale-free Networks. The characteristic of scale-free networks is that they
demonstrate a power-law degree distribution. However, by varying the CPA coeﬃcient, it is possible to obtain
networks that are scale-free to varying degrees. The degree distribution of a particular network would be a scalefree distribution if it ﬁts a function of the form y = αxγ [24]. Here, γ is called the scale-free exponent. The
scale-free exponent of a particular network can be obtained by ﬁtting its degree disbtribution to a power-law
curve.
By comparing the correlation of the degree values obtained from the power-law ﬁtted curve and the actual
degree values, we can measure the variation of a particular network from the ideal scale-free model. The higher
the correlation, the better the ﬁt. According to the γ correlation values in Table 1, we can see that the CPA
coeﬃcient is inversely proportional to the scale-free nature of a network. Thus, the CPA model could be used to
vary the scale-free nature of the network.
Another important characteristic that we were interested in this study is the network assortativity. As mentioned before, assortativity measures the tendency of similar nodes to be connected in a network. Although
assortativity is prevalent in many real world networks, BA model typically does not produce networks that show
assortativite behaviour (i.e the synthesized networks tend to be disassortative). However, with the CPA, it is possible to generate networks with assortativity, while retaining the scale-free model intact. Moreover, it is evident
from the results that there exists a positive correlation between the assortativity and the CPA coeﬃcient. Thus, the
CPA coeﬃcient can be thought of as a control parameter for controlling the assortativity of a particular generated
network.
5. Using CPA to model real world networks
To understand how the CPA can be better used to model real world networks, we used CPA to model a few
online social networks and other scale free networks with particular structural characteristics. We note that though
both PA and CPA can be used to generate scale-free networks, that alone would not be suﬃcient to determine
which model is a better ﬁt for the real networks. We use a number of common network parameters such as the
network diameter, clustering coeﬃcient and assortativity to compare the PA and CPA based networks with the
real-networks. The simulated networks were generated in such a way that they would have similar sizes and linkto-node ratios to those of the real networks that were considered. Table 2 shows the results obtained from several
online social networks and collaboration networks, in comparison with the CPA based networks generated with
diﬀerent CPA coeﬃcient values. For this comparison, we used a New Orleans Facebook social network dataset
[25] at three diﬀerent stages of its growth. A collaboration network of Fortune 1000 company directors [26] was
also used for the comparison. In this comparison, the networks generated with the CPA coeﬃcient 0 are regarded
as the equivalent classical PA based Networks.
According to the comparison given in Table 2, the CPA based networks can generate networks with assortative
mixing, unlike the BA model. The assortativity is correlated to the CPA coeﬃcient. The CPA generated networks
show scale-free behavior, although with higher CPA values the networks seem to be deviating from the scale-free
behaviour, evident from the lowering correlation values. From the above ﬁgures, it is evident the CPA model can
be used to generated networks that matches well with the real networks when it comes to network assortativity,
while holding the scale-free nature of the network, within a certain range of CPA coeﬃcient values.
On the other hand, the clustering coeﬃcients of the CPA model based networks is lower than those of PA
based networks. The average path lengths of the CPA generated networks are also slightly increasing with the

of the New Orleans Facebook network at three diﬀerent stages of its evolution and the Fortune 1000 company directors’ network, with the
same network properties of simulated networks of similar sizes and link to node ratios. The simulated networks were generated based on both
CPA and PA, using diﬀerent CPA coeﬃcient values. The networks generated with the CPA coeﬃcient value 0 represents the equivalent PA
based networks.

CPA coeﬃcient values. Higher clustering coeﬃcient and lower average path length are considered to be the characteristics of the small-world model [12]. This suggests that the CPA based networks tend to deviate further from
the small-world model compared to the networks that are based on PA. Diameter and modularity of CPA based
networks are quite similar to those of PA based networks, while both of them remain lower than the respective
values of real networks.
What we can note in summary is that the CPA growth model is handier to model real world networks, due
to the presence of the additional parameter, C. The CPA model subsumes the PA model, and in some cases at
least, the additional ﬂexibility oﬀered by the parameter C results in better ﬁt in terms of assortativity etc. After
preferential attachment, a number of context speciﬁc growth models have been proposed for various networks
such as internet [27, 28, 29]. However, we may argue that Cyclic preferential attachment is a generic growth
model with more ﬂexibility to model real world scale-free networks, compared to classic PA.
6. Conclusions and future work
In this paper, we introduced cyclic preferential attachment (CPA), as an extension to the classic preferential
attachment (Barabasi-Albert) growth model. The key diﬀerence between CPA and the traditional PA is that CPA
model considers the inﬂuence of indirect neighbours in preferential mixing, where as PA considers only the direct
neighbours of a node. Considering the indirect neighbours agrees with real world scenarios in many cases. Thus,
CPA provides an enhanced perspective on network growth, and encourages a more holistic approach in network
modelling.
We also introduced the CPA coeﬃcient as a new control parameter that could be used to synthesise scale-free
networks with a wider range of structural features. For example, this control parameter could be used to vary
the assortativity of the simulated network. This facilitates more ﬂexibility in network modelling compared to the
traditional PA model. We demonstrated this by attempting to model real world scale free networks with classic
PA and CPA.
CPA based modelling tries to bridge the gap between the preferential attachment and structural features such as
assortativity in complex network analysis. Thus, with CPA, networks with a wide range of assortativity values can
be modelled while preserving the scale-free model. Similarly, wider ranges of network diameter, average shortest
path length etc can be modelled. We found that other parameters such as modularity were not greatly inﬂuenced
by the CPA parameter. However, the CPA does not model well the high clustering coeﬃcient values that are found
in real networks, thus deviating from the small-world behavior for high values of CPA parameter. This may be
due to the fact that when a network is generated under CPA, the network tends to be more homogeneous and
connected. One key reason for this tendency could be that in the CPA based networks, the nodes with higher
degrees would contribute some of their ‘attractiveness’ to the surrounding nodes as well.
We have only looked at a limited number of real-world networks to evaluate the CPA based model in our research. It would be interesting to observe how the CPA model can be applied to other forms of complex networks,
such as brain networks, cellular networks and the Internet. Moreover, we have only done some preliminary analysis with the parameter space of the CPA model. It would be interesting to comprehensively explore the parameter
space of the CPA model and observe the range of the structural features it can generate.
