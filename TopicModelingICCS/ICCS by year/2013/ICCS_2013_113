Abstract
Parisian options are complex path-dependent options developed by barrier option. Moving window Parisian options are higher
path-dependent options, which are widely used in the ﬁeld of convertible bonds in recent years. In this work we propose
to price moving window Parisian option by use of hitting time. A simulation algorithm of the pricing is presented. As an
application, we provide the pricing equations of convertible bonds with reset clause. Furthermore our simulation method is
applied to price convertible bonds with reset clause using the data in China mainland stock exchange. The results show that
this algorithm can undoubtedly improve the accuracy of the convertible bonds pricing.

1. Introduction
Parisian option is a path-dependent option which is triggered by the ﬁrst time the underlying asset price process
spends a given time period below or above some level(barrier). The Parisian contract feature can be generally
described in a consecutive or a cumulative way. In the consecutive case,the measurement of the duration below
or above the barrier restarts from zero at each time the barrier is crossed, whereas these consecutive periods are
summed in the cumulative case. The moving window Parisian option which is a hybrid variant of the cumulative
and consecutive Parisian options, counts the cumulative time below or above the barrier some level over any prespeciﬁed time length (window length). Once the moving window Parisian option is activated, its payoﬀ at maturity
equals that of the corresponding standard European option and it will expire instantly.
There have already existed a lot of studies on the consecutive Parisian option and cumulative Parisian option,
such as [2]-[5], [9]-[19] and so on. Basically, the Parisian option can be priced either by Laplace transforms or
partial diﬀerential equations (PDE for short). However, research on the moving window feature is little. To our
knowledge, [7] computes the moving window Parisian option in discrete case using the forward shooting grid
approach. Since the moving window Parisian option appears to exhibit a high path-dependence, it is diﬃcult

to handle the window feature eﬀectively for pricing option under continuous-time framework. It is not quite
straightforward to explicitly derive the partial diﬀerential equation or explicit formulas for the option price. So
we could not use the classical methods of Parisian option to price the moving window Parisian option. In this
paper we will evaluate this option by use of the method in [1]. We construct a simulation algorithm of the moving
window Parisian option based on hitting time simulation.
Parisian option is not popularly exchange-traded, but there are various applications of Parisian optionality in
the mathematical ﬁnance. These provisions based on the duration of breaching may be applied with the convertibility and callability features in convertible bonds i.e. [8]. Usually reset convertibles are usually issued when the
prospect for the issuer is unfavorable. And recently convertible bonds with reset clause where the reset time is
with the feature of moving window Parisian option are widely issued in Chinese capital market. Therefore, we will
apply moving window Parisian option to price such convertible bonds with reset clause. Herein ”reset” means that
the conversion price is adjusted downwards if the underlying stock price satisﬁes pre-speciﬁed provisions. We derive the pricing equations of conversion option for the single reset and multiple resets, respectively. It generalizes
the case of [6] by developing the formula for the conversion option with the reset clause under the condition of
determinant reset time. Then basing on the derived formula we pricing six convertible bonds chosen from China
mainland stock exchange which are Gehua, Chuantou, Guotou, Bohui, Chengxin and Yanjin convertible bonds.
The simulation results show that the pricing error is much smaller compared with standard Monte Carlo method,
which illustrates that the pricing method of convertible bonds by hitting time simulation we propose is eﬀective.
Our work makes two contributions to the literature. First, this paper is one of few studies that consider the
pricing of moving window Parisian option under continuous-time framework. For discretely moving window
Parisian option, it is possible to solve the problem numerically because the describing PDE has ﬁnite dimensions.
For continuously moving window Parisian option, the describing PDE has inﬁnite dimensions and pricing is
an extremely diﬃcult task. And we provide an eﬃcient way to approximate the price of continuously moving
window Parisian option by hitting time simulation based on [1]. Second, our numerical results can be used to
price convertible bonds with reset clause and the reset time is characterized by moving window Parisian option.
And our pricing method of convertible bonds with reset clause are shown to be very eﬃcient in applications.
Especially, we apply our method to price convertible bonds with reset clause using the data in Chinese capital
market. The results show that compared with standard Monte Carlo method, our method improves the accuracy
of the convertible bonds pricing signiﬁcantly.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider the valuation of the moving window Parisian
option and present the result. In Section 3 we deduce the pricing equation of convertible bonds with reset clause.
We empirically analyze convertible bonds price with reset clause in Section 4 as an application of moving window
Parisian option. We conclude in last Section.
2. Moving window parisian option problem
We will describe the feature of moving window parisian option. We only focus on the down-and-in call in this
section.
Deﬁne C the length of the moving window. The moving window parisian option (down-and-in call) is knocked
in if the underlying asset price lies below the barrier total D units of time within any length of window C. Obviously, D ≤ C ≤ T.
To describe the stopping time with window parisian feature at (or away from) barrier L for an Itˆo process S .
We deﬁne

τ = in f {t ≥ C,

Let {S t , t ∈ [0, T ]} be the risk-neutral asset price process given by

follows that

S t = S 0 e(r− 2 σ )t+σBt .

Then we introduce the following notations Bt = mt − Bt , m = σ2 , l = σ1 ln SL0 .We know from Gisanov’s
Theorem that there exists an equivalent measure Q such that Bt is a standard Brownian motion under Q and

dQ = exp{mBT − 2 T }, thus S t rewrite S t = e
be written in the following:

where τH = in f {t > τ, Bt = l}, BC(L, T, K) is the Black-Scholes pricing formula for European call option with

Since the stock price S t hits the level L can be transformed to Bt hits the level l =

Remark 1. When the window C takes diﬀerent values, the moving window parisian option can be reduced to
diﬀerent parisian options. i.e. C takes T, D, respectively. the moving window parisian option becomes cumulative
parisian option, consecutive parisian option respectively. In this sense, the moving window Parisian option we
consider generalizes the case in [1]
Now we compute the moving window Parisian option value in equation (2) by constructing a simulation
algorithm. We will use the method in [1] to approximate directly hitting time τH by the simulation of hitting
times. Then we need the distribution function of τl = in f {t ≥ 0, Bt = l}, which is given by:
l
Fτl (t) = P(τl ≤ t) = 2P(Bt ≤ l) = 2Φ( √ ),
t

where Φ is standard normal distribution function. In order to draw the samples, we get the inverse distribution
function:
l
Fτ−1l (y) = ( −1 y )2
(5)
Φ (2)
In order to compute the value in (2), we mainly simulate the hitting time with the nature of moving window
Parisian time. The approximation of τH will be done in the following way. Similarly in [1], Let’s ﬁx an > 0 and
and take l ( ) such that hitting the level L− by B is equivalent to hitting the level l by B. Now we simulate τ1 from
F0,l , the distribution of hitting times of B hitting l starting in 0. Then we simulate τ2 from Fl ,l the distribution of
hitting times of B hitting l, starting in l , and τ3 from Fl,l the distribution of hitting times of B hitting l , starting
in l. It is noted that Fl,l = Fl ,l = F0,l−l = Fτl−l , since B is symmetric and stationarity, which is the standard
Brownian motion under Q. We also introduce the extra variable h1 , h, that is initially zero respectively. Setting
h1 = h1 + τ3 , h = h + τ2 , we have four possibilities:
1. If τ1 + τ2 > T , we throw away the sample.
2. If h > H, we have a sample of τH . And we stop, keeping the sample.
3. If h < H, and h1 < C − H, we need to get back at l again. Then we simulate τ4 from Fl ,l the distribution of
hitting times of B hitting l, starting in l . Letting τ1 = τ1 + τ2 + τ3 .We keep on repeating this until we either
have to throw away the sample or we can keep it.
4. If h < H, and h1 ≥ C − H, we need to start to move backward two periods and keep on repeating the above
process until we either have to throw away the sample or we can keep it.
Transforming this in a simulation algorithm and using the hitting time distribution in (4) and its inverse in (5),
we obtain the following algorithm on moving window Parisian option.
∗ take α = Fτl (T ), h = 0, h1 = 0,Res = 0
∗ Repeat N times:
Sample U from U[0, α], obtain the sample τ1
while (τ1 < T ) and (h < H)
sample w from U[0, 1] ;
(w);
obtain τ2 = Fτ−1
(l −l)
τ1 = τ1 + τ2 ;
h = h + τ2 ;
while h < H
sample w from U[0, 1] ;
(w);
obtain τ3 = Fτ−1
(l −l)
τ1 = τ1 + τ3 ;
h1 = h1 + τ3 ;
if h1 > (C − H)
the initial point of h, h1 move backward one period respectively, break
if else
sample w from U[0, 1] ;
(w);
obtain τ4 = Fτ−1
(l −l)
τ1 = τ1 + τ4 ;
h = h + τ4 ;

if τ1 < T
res = res + exp(−(r + m2 /2) ∗ τ) ∗ BS (L, T − τ1 , K);
∗ res = ( N1 ) ∗ exp(m ∗ l) ∗ alpha ∗ res.
Remark 2. As is analyzed in [1], the accuracy of the approximation can be controlled. In fact there are two
aspects aﬀecting the option price, on the one hand, sample paths that stay long enough below the barrier L not
hitting the level L - are thrown away, on the other hand, the time from the last exit of the level L up to the ﬁrst
hitting of level L - is not taken into account. The error of the ﬁrst factor introduced to a particular choice of is
negligible, and the expected value of error in variable can be 13 ( ln(L−σ /L) )2 . And the quality of this approximation
is a trade-oﬀ between accuracy and computation time.
3. Pricing convertible bonds with reset clause
In this section we consider the convertible bond which is non-callable and non-convertible until maturity T .
For a class of non-callable convertible bonds with the reset clause, under the assumptions of no dividends on
the underlying stock and the ﬂat term structure of the risk-free interest rate, no conversion occurs prior to maturity,
then the conversion option must necessarily be the European type. Hence, convertible bond price VCB = straight
bond value VB + conversion option value VCO .
Suppose K is the original conversion price, and let τ be the downward reset time with characteristics of moving
window parisian option. Then, the actual conversion price of the reset convertible is changed to bK (b < 1) if the
stock price satisﬁes downward reset clause of the convertible bonds, or it remains K otherwise. This implies that
the conversion price is adjusted downwards from K to bK when τ ≤ T . In other words, the conversion ratio is
adjusted upwards from B/K to B/(bK) when τ ≤ T , where B is the par value of the convertible bond.
As a basic framework for pricing, we use the bond plus option valuation. We mainly focus on the price
of conversion option, which is essential for analyzing the price of convertible bonds under the constant interest
rate assumption. Assume that the convertible bond receives a coupon of amount C(> 0) at time (i = 1, ..., m)
where0 < T 1 < T 2 < . . . < T m < T . For the straight bond value VB , we immediately have
m

VB = C

e−rTi + Be−rT .

i=1

On the other hand, for the conversion option price VCO , we have
Theorem 2. Let VCO be the conversion option value of the credit-riskless, non-callable, convertible bond with
the downward reset clause at time t = 0. τ is reset time with characteristics of moving window parisian option,
and aK is the predetermined stock price, 1 > a > b. Then,

Using Theorem 1 and fact K > aK > bK, the result follows.

The reset right embedded in a derivative refers to the feature that the issuer can alter certain terms in the
derivative contract according to some preset rules. In the following, we consider options that allow the issuer to
adjust the conversion price by number of times according to predetermined rules during the life of the convertible
bond. It is noted that the necessary assumption for Theorem 3 to hold is that whenever the reset clause is satisﬁed,
the conversion option price cann’t be adjusted downward until the stock price goes back the predetermined price .
Theorem 3. Let V MCO be the conversion option value of the credit-riskless, non-callable, convertible bond
with the multiple downward reset clause at time t = 0. For τi , i = 1, · · · n. are reset times with characteristics of
moving window parisian option,b1 K < b2 K < · · · < bn K are conversion prices, a1 K < a2 K < · · · < an K are the
predetermined stock prices, 1 > bi > ai , respectively. Let’s deﬁne τHi = in f {t > τi , Bt = li }, Suppose the counting

4. Simulating the price of convertible bonds with reset clause
In this section, we will apply hitting time simulation method into convertible bonds with reset clause in China
mainland stock exchange. The reset clause can be triggered only one time or many times and reset time is with
the feature of moving window Parisian option in the market. Therefore we classiﬁed them into single-triggered
and multi-triggered types.
In order to get the price of convertible bonds with reset clause, we mainly compute the conversion options
price. Then we employ our pricing method to calculate the price of single-triggered and multi-triggered conversion
options by Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. For the ﬁrst type, if the reset clause is triggered, the actual conversion price
will be turn down, or or it remains unchanged. And for the second type, if the reset clause is triggered for

1680

Dongmei Guo et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 1674 – 1683

many times the actual conversion price will be adjusted downward successively for every trigger, or it remains
unchanged.
In fact, all convertible bonds are listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China
market. Up to now, the issues of convertible bonds were 76 and some convertible bond had matured and the
listed convertible bonds are 35. We will choose some convertible bonds which satisfy the conditions described
in Theorem 2,3. They are Gehua(No.1) convertible bond, Chuantou(No.2) convertible bond, Guotou(No.3) convertible bond, Chengxin(No.4) convertible bond and Yanjin(No.5) convertible bond. Table 1 lists the necessary
information and parameters for empirical analysis.

In table 1, trigger condition such as 10/20, 90% means that if the underlying asset price lies below 90%K
beyond 10 days within any length of window 20 days, the conversion price is adjust downward (such as 95%K).
And in order to determine the interest rate, we choose the interest rate for three-month bank deposit within the
convertible bond maturity. Without loss of generality, we choose the historical data of 100 days from initial time
to estimate the volatility.
Table 2 shows the simulation results of ﬁve convertible bonds. Because the listed company which issued convertible bond seldom issue dividend, we neglect its eﬀect on convertible bond price. And coupon rate of convertble
bond is extremely low, we also neglect its eﬀect on convertible bond price. Face value of the convertible bond
is 100. In this paper, the convertible bond price =face value of convertible bond*e−rT + convertible ratio*option
price.

According to information in market, Gehua(No.1) convertible bond and Chuantou(No.2) convertible bond are
only triggered once, so we use Theorem 2 to calculate conversion price. And Guotou(No.3) convertible bond and
Yanjin(No.5) convertible bond are triggered twice while Chengxin(No.4) convertible bond is triggered six times,
then we use Theorem 3 to calculate conversion price.
From table 2 we can ﬁnd that the pricing error is very small. Therefore accurate pricing results illustrates that
the pricing method of convertible bonds by hitting time simulation we propose is eﬀective.
Furthermore, we compare the bond prices calculated by hitting time method and the standard Monte Carlo
method. The following table shows the results of the comparison.
Table 3 shows that the bond prices calculated by standard Monte Carlo method are systematically larger than
the bond prices calculated by hitting time method. And the error using hitting time simulation is much less than
the error using standard Monte Carlo method, which means our method can eﬃciently improve the accuracy of
the convertible bonds pricing.

5. Conclusion remarks
Based on the above analysis, exploration on moving window parisian option pricing pushes forward application of such options. Applying the hitting time simulation algorithm into convertible bonds with reset clause, it can
grasp the characteristics of these clauses more accurately, and undoubtedly contributes to improve the accuracy of
the convertible bonds pricing.
