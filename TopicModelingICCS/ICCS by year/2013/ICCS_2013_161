Abstract

Density functional theory (DFT) calculationss were used to predict and rationalize the effect of thee modification
of the structure of the prototype 1,3-biss(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) (IPr) N-heterocyclic
N
carbene (NHC) ligand. The modification coonsists in the substitution of the methyl groups of orrtho isopropyl
substituent with phenyl groups, and here we
w plan to describe how such significant changes efffect the metal
environment and therefore the related catalyttic behaviour by simple steric maps. Bearing in mind that there is a
significant structural difference between IPrr and IPr* ligands, that translated in different reactiviity for several
olefin metathesis reactions, here by means of
o DFT we characterize where the NHC ligand plays a more active
role and where it is a simple spectator, or at
a least its modification does not significantly changee its catalytic
role/performance. Furthermore, this communnication endeavours to modify further the skeleton of the IPr NHC
ligand. The optimization of these bulky new systems go to the limits of the DFT computational meethod.

1. Introduction
Society is facing tremendous challenges in thhe 21st century to maintain earth and its living beings in a suustainable way.
With a growing population and dwindling resourcces, the need to provide clean water, food and energy, as weell as affordable

scientists.
Seeking to contribute to solutions for the Worldd’s well-being from many different angles, we regard thee synthesis and

also for the reduction of the economic cost of transforming organic substrates. Finding new catalysts is a hard but exciting
task, often driven by trial and error. In this respect, computational techniques can be used to screen novel catalyst
architectures more rapidly to obtain insights that could help in the design and experimental synthesis of novel and improved
catalysts. Bearing in mind the great work done in metathesis and mainly in Ru-based catalysts with N-heterocyclic carbenes
(NHC, Figure 1),[1] here we wish to use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to characterize how adding steric hindrance to a
particular NHC such as IPr ( IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) affects its reactivity.[2,3] DFT-based
prediction of the reactivity of new catalysts is not a new approach, and systematic methods are searched for a priori
computational prediction to see whether a catalyst will be feasible experimentally, productive and fruitful in industry.[4]

Figure 1. Commonly used NHC in ruthenium olefin metathesis.

Taking into consideration that the latest big leap in the evolution of ruthenium based olefin metathesis catalysts was
made by exchanging one of the phosphines in the first generation catalyst for a N-heterocyclic carbene ligand,[5,6] here we
search how present computational tools might help improve the design of NHC ligands.
The so-called second generation catalysts (those bearing a NHC ligand) are much more active in olefin metathesis than
their first generation counterparts, and although many variations of the basic layout have been disclosed over the past 10
years,[7,8] a single universal catalyst superior to the rest of the field in all metathesis transformations has not been achieved,
instead, a range of catalysts able to fulfil particular requests have been found. Here we want to examine if it is reasonable to
continue exploring new NHC ligands with ever increasing complexity with respect to the common IPr, its saturated
backbone relative SIPr and the 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene (SIMes) congener,[8,9] and
rationalize the reactivity differences observed between IPr-, IPr*- and IPr*Tol-bearing olefin metathesis catalysts.[10]

2. Computational Details
All DFT static calculations were performed at the GGA level with the Gaussian09 set of programs,[11] using the BP86
functional of Becke and Perdew.[12] The electronic configuration of the molecular systems was described with the standard
split-valence basis set with a polarization function of Ahlrichs and co-workers for H, C, N, P, and Cl (SVP keyword in
Gaussian).[ 13 ] For Ru we used the small-core, quasi-relativistic Stuttgart/Dresden effective core potential, with an
associated valence basis set contracted (standard SDD keywords in gaussian09).[11] The geometry optimizations were
performed without symmetry constraints, and the characterization of the located stationary points was performed by
analytical frequency calculations. The reported energies have been optimized via single point calculations on the BP86
geometries with triple zeta valence plus polarization (TZVP keyword in Gaussian) using the M06 functional,[14] however
estimating solvent effects with the polarizable continuous solvation model PCM using CH2Cl2 as solvent.[15] For all
energies given throughout the text, zero point energies and thermal corrections calculated at the BP86 level were added to
the M06 in solvent energies to approximate free energies in solvent.
Bearing in mind that Mayer Bond Order (MBO) theory gives insight into the strength of the bonds,[16] MBOs between
two atoms A and B have been calculated through the eq 1,[17] where S is the atomic orbital overlap matrix and P is the
density matrix. The sums run over the basis set functions belonging to a given atom A or B.

3. Results and Discussion
DFT calculations have initially been performed on the geometry of complexes 1-3 in Figure 3 and the optimized
structure of complex 1 is overall in excellent agreement with the X-ray structure (rmsd=0.033 Å on distances and 0.8° on
angles).[23,24]
The effect of the coordination of IPr and IPr* in the Ru catalysts was first evaluated by analysing the strength of the RuNHC bond. As expected, the Ru-IPr bond is somewhat shorter than the Ru-IPr* and the Ru- IPr*Tol bonds for the
complexes containing PPh3, while the difference is minimal in the later complexes. To have a better understanding of the
different stability of the Ru-NHC and Ru-P bonds in 1-3, we performed a Mayer Bond Order (MBO) analysis.[16,17] The
analysis showed that the Ru-P bond trans to the NHC ligand, displays MBO values of 0.550, 0.587, and 0.581 for 1-3
respectively; while the Ru-NHC MBOs are 0.817, 0.777, and 0.776. These results are in line with the evidence that the
modifications on the IPr ligand weaken the Ru-NHC bond significantly (comparing systems 2 and 3 with 1), thus
enhancing interaction of the other labile ligand with the metal. Focusing on the MBOs of the Ru-indenylidene bond, 1.472,
1.456, and 1.457 for 1-3 respectively indicates that replacing the IPr ligand by the sterically demanding IPr* and IPr*Tol
ligands impacts the strength of the Ru-NHC and Ru-P bonds, but has minor influence on the Ru-alkylidene bond. The
weakened Ru-IPr* and Ru-IPr*Tol bonds in 2 and 3 can be ascribed to steric repulsion between the bulky ortho-CHPh2
groups of these NHC ligands and PPh3.

The energy cost for the dissociation of PPh3 was evaluated next (Figure 4), spanning from 14.9 for 1 to 12.0 for 2 and
19.4 kcal/mol for 3. Although the differences are not big, they are significant. Surprisingly, the energies follow the trend 3
(IPr*Tol) > 1 (IPr) > 2 (IPr*). The value for 2 is uncertain because it was expected that the substitution of IPr by IPr*
could improve the activation significantly, however, the dissociation is disfavored by 2.9 kcal/mol. In contrast, and as
expected, dissociation of PPh3 from 3 requires 4.5 kcal/mol more than for 1. Although the barrier for dissociation could be
helpful for the representation of the thermodynamic of the labile ligand dissociation, the large size of the modified IPr
ligands, specially the IPr*Tol, excludes the search for these barriers. However, here conceptual DFT supposes a great tool to
overcome such problems and it is a cheap tool to compare the reactivity between similar catalysts from an electronic point
of view, and could avoid the study of all the species involved in the olefin metathesis pathway for future comparisons with
other NHC ligands. Thus, although this modification of the IPr ligand deals principally with the steric influence of the IPr*
ligand, we also examined simple electronic properties such as chemical hardness and electrophilicity for complexes 1-3.[1821] The chemical hardness values are 0.0123, 0.0126, and 0.0148 a.u., which means that complexes containing the modified
IPr ligands are less hard, and thus tend to be less reactive, specially complex 3 with the IPr*Tol ligand. On the other hand,
the electrophilicity values are 0.719, 0.701, and 0.670 a.u., and these values confirm that the affinity to react with a
nucleophile is similar for all complexes, following the trend of the bulkier the NHC ligand the less reactive the system is,
mainly due to the reduction of the free space around the Ru center. Thus, these low differences confirm that the diverse
catalytic performance of these complexes should be mainly related to different steric properties.
Moving to the olefin metathesis reaction itself, for the sake of clarity we used ethylene as the olefin substrate in the
calculations.[25] Coordination of ethylene to the 14e- substrate, see Figure 4, is an endothermic step for all complexes
except for 3, where there is a release of 1.8 kcal/mol.

The following step is the metallacycle formaation, and again, the complexes behave similarly with an energy
e
release,
although small differences can be found. For all species the metallacycle is more stable than the coordinatioon intermediate
CI1, but for system 1, with IPr, the metallacycle is more stable than the CI species, by 2.8 kcal/mol. Then, in the presence
of the bulky IPr*Tol in 3, the metallacycle is 3.1 kcal/mol less stable than the CI intermediate, whereas forr the less bulky
1 kcal/mol. However, these energy differences are scarce and no trend is
IPr* in system 2 this difference reduces to just 1.0
detected.
The main goal of the geometrical modificationn of the IPr ligand was to understand how the modified steriic properties of
IPr* effected the reactivity. To analyze the steriic influence of the ligand we used topographic steric maps. The points in
space defining the steric map were located with thhe SambVca package developed by us.[26] This program annalyzes the first
coordination sphere around the metal, which is thhe place where catalysis occurs. It is normally used to calcuulate the buried
volume of a given ligand, which is a number that
t
quantifies the amount of the first coordination spherre of the metal
occupied by this ligand.[27] A modified versioon of SambVca allows the user to perform a more detailled analysis by
evaluating the %VBur in the single quadrants around the Ru center, as well as the steric map of the NHC in thhe Ru-systems.
Splitting the total %VBur into quadrant contributioons quantifies any asymmetry in the way the ligand wraps arround the metal
and allows to understand how changing the ligandd from IPr to IPr* modifies the shape of the reactive pockeet.[28] We have
already introduced topographic steric maps to chharacterize Ru-complexes relevant to olefin metathesis.[266,28] The steric
maps were calculated for the free ligands first, without
w
symmetry constraints, and then for the ligands in com
mplexes 1-3 as
well as in the next 14e species, as well as for the metallacycle
m
intermediates.

For an easy comprehension, these steric maps allow comparative analyses between different complexes. Indeed, steric
maps could be considered as the classical geographic physical maps (see Figure 5), that depict the physical features like
various landforms and water bodies present on the Earth’s surface. Different colors, lines, tints, shading and spot elevations
are used to show the elevation and to differentiate lowlands from the mountains in physical maps. We used the same
philosophy to build the steric maps of the complexes. The Ru center is at level zero, and the ligands are placed at the same
plane or below the metal. In this framework, brown areas indicate zones where the ligand protrudes like a mountain towards
the reacting groups, thus limiting the space at their disposal, whereas blue areas indicate empty zones where the ligand
retracts like a lake from the reacting groups.
The map of the free NHC ligand for IPr* reported in Figure 6 shows clearly that is much more sterically demanding than
IPr, whereas for IPr*Tol this comparison is not so clear. The buried %VBur is 50.0% for IPr* and and 51.0% for IPr*Tol,
whereas a value of only 42.2% is found for IPr. Bearing in mind that the topographic maps characterize the ligand surface
offered to the substrate, it is clear that the modified IPr ligands have an intrinsic strong steric hindrance that after binding to
the metal precludes coordination of big substrates.

passing through the carbene C atom of the NHC ring. The carbene C atom of the NHC ring is at the origin.

Focusing on the steric maps in Figure 6 in more detail,(1994) the IPr map shows that the two quadrants on the right are
slightly more hindered, but this asymmetry is negligible compared to the asymmetry in the IPr* map, where the distribution
of the steric bulk around the metal is remarkably different and the hindrance is much more localized into two quadrants (top
right and bottom left quadrants %VBur~70%, top left and bottom right quadrants %VBur~29%). Thus, although the %VBur
values are similar for IPr* and IPr*Tol the steric maps are key to further understand that the simple para substitution of the
phenyl groups in IPr*Tol with respect to IPr* allows more reactive surface for a substrate around the metal with IPr*Tol.
Figure 7 reports the steric maps for the three ligands in catalysts 1-3. The maps are very different from those of the free
NHCs. In particular the IPr* ligand is able to rearrange in less sterically demanding conformations with the aromatic
groups on the NHC somewhat bent to adopt a final position further away from the metal. The %VBur 29.1, 28.6 and 28.7 for
complexes 1-3, respectively, thus with no significant differences. To further evaluate differences between IPr and IPr* we
calculated the steric maps for the 14e- species, see again Figure 8. In these systems the modified IPr* and IPr*Tol ligands
create higher steric constraints than IPr. In particular, they again adopt a quite asymmetric folding, creating a groove into
which the olefin has to coordinate. Differently, the IPr ligand shapes a flat surface to host the incoming olefin. Overall, this
analysis indicates that modified IPr ligands can be seen as rather flexible ligands that are able to exert steric pressure to
push away the incoming substrate. At the same time, they are not too rigid, so that they can retract away to make space for
other ligands. This analysis highlights the intrinsic dynamic behavior of the modified IPr ligands, indicating that the
interaction between the complex and the substrate requires a conformation rearrangement of the complex, more consistent
with an induce fit model rather than with a key and lock model.

Experimentally, it was observed that complexes bearing the IPr* ligand are only more active than complexes bearing the
IPr ligand when low hindered substrates are used, and that complex 1 was the most active of all.10 However, when bulkier
substrates were used, the IPr bearing complexes showed always superior activity. This can be easily explained by analysis
of the steric maps and of the energy profiles we calculated. Even though the energy barrier of the phosphine dissociation is
similar and even higher for IPr*, from the steric maps the bulkier IPr* ligand favors dissociation of bulky labile ligands
such as PPh3, and still can coordinate well small substrates, thus resulting in good catalytic performances. Consistently,
coordination of bulky substrates is more difficult for the IPr* bearing complexes, thus making the reaction proceed
significantly slower than with their IPr counterparts.
In Figures 8-10 the steric maps of the 14e-, CI and Metallacycle species show that surprisingly the %VBur values for
IPr*Tol are lower than for IPr*. For the 14e- species are 33.0, 35.3 and 34.4 for complexes 1-3, respectively; for the CI
30.9, 32.4, and 31.3, whereas for the Metallacycle intermediate 32.5, 33.5, and 32.9. Thus, the results of IPr*Tol look
promising because they seem to collect the advantages of the higher steric pressure of IPr* with respect to IPr. The para
substitution of the phenyl groups allows to increase the free surface around the metal because the modification renders the
IPr*Tol less flexible than IPr* as can be observed in the steric maps of the free ligand species in Figure 7. However,
bearing in mind previous studies,29 we must point out that the differences between IPr* with respect to IPr*Tol are subtle,
and the a priori expected higher sterical hindrance of IPr*Tol is not translated into new relevant insights, suggesting that the
modification of the NHC must be focused in the part nearer to the metal core.

Conclusions
Screening of new catalysts in silico is an area that could assist experimental tests in targeting preferred structural types. In
this contribution, the catalytic performance of ruthenium IPr, IPr*, and IPr*Tol complexes were tested in such a manner for
an olefin metathesis reaction. The calculations allowed the rationalization of the experimental findings and thus validate the
computational mode, as well as to predict a new NHC ligand such as IPr*Tol. These results also highlight the potential of
computational methods to assist in the development of novel catalyst types in silico thereby providing a significant
resource-saving tool to rational catalyst design.
