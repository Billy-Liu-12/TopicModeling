Abstract
The occurrence and spatial arrangement of post-ﬁre alive residual stands aﬀect the recolonization of trees and animals of
burned areas in boreal ecosystems. Because the analysis of residual stands in the ﬁeld is prohibitively expensive we lack
understanding on how residual stands are distributed and why. Here, we explore the use of high-resolution Quickbird satellite
imagery in conjunction with in-situ measurements and machine learning techniques to map basal area of spruce and ﬁr for two
ﬁre areas in Central Siberia, and analyze the distribution of residual stands with respect to topography.
First, an advanced feature selection algorithm which combines a genetic algorithm with guided local search is wrapped
around the Random Forests regression technique, to identify suitable variable subsets out of a large number of candidate
variables that were derived from Quickbird data. Second, we train and apply Random Forests using the derived variable
subsets to the two ﬁre areas to generate spatially explicit estimates of basal area for spruce and ﬁr. Third, we analyze species
speciﬁc diﬀerences and the relationship between basal area and topography using a high resolution digital elevation model
from ASTER data.
Our results show that the main gradients of species speciﬁc basal area can be reproduced using Quickbird data but stress the
importance of variable selection. We ﬁnd associations of residual stands with topography - depressions and channels exhibit
larger prevalence of residual stands than ridges or plateaus, the latter being more often subject to severe ﬁres. We further
found that the relationship between basal area and elevation tends to be reversed inside the burned area in comparison to the
surrounding unburned forest. Our results suggest that local topography may control the sensitivity of ecological processes to
a changing ﬁre regime with more severe ﬁres, and highlight the synergistic use of high resolution satellite remote sensing and
machine learning methods for ﬁre ecological applications.

1. Introduction
Fires are a key factor in boreal ecosystems that concern nature conservation and management practices [1], the
natural regeneration [2], as well as carbon dynamics [3]. Fires in the boreal forest are predicted to move towards
a higher frequency, size and severity [4, 5]. Most research on ﬁre related eﬀects on ecosystems concentrated in

North America, while comparatively little is known for Siberia. In Central Siberia forest ﬁres are abundant with
about 1.1 × 107 ha burning each year [6].
Fires generally do not burn the entire landscape - residual alife stands, either distributed as isolated trees
or patches that survived the ﬁre are an important but often overlooked factor for the post-ﬁre development of the
area. Surviving residual stands provide important seed sources for the revegetation [7, 8]. Seed dispersal limitation
could lead to changes in species composition [9] and biomass recovery [10] – which could lead to inﬂuences of
residual stands on carbon ﬂuxes [11]. Residual stands further serve as refuges for animals to recolonize the area
when it becomes revegetated [12].
To understand eﬀects of an intensifying ﬁre regime on post ﬁre processes and population dynamics especially
knowledge of the spatial variability of burned areas and their arrangement of residual stands is needed [13]. Such
analysis is extremely expensive and time consuming to conduct entirely in the ﬁeld, which is particularly true for
Central Siberia because the burned areas there are hardly accessible without helicopter ﬂights. Some studies used
high resolution aerial photography to analyze residual stands and counted survived trees [14, 15, 16, 17] but such
data are not available for Central Siberia, and a more informative measure like basal area (fractional area covered
by cross-sections of trees) would be desirable. Although highlighted as a research gap [13], we are not aware of
a study that explores commercial high resolution satellite data (e.g. Quickbird) to map the basal area of diﬀerent
tree species of residual stands.
In this paper we aim to produce and analyze species speciﬁc maps of basal area for two ﬁre areas in Central
Siberia. To do so we integrate in-situ measurements from ﬁeld campaigns, high resolution Quickbird data, and
machine learning methods for feature selection and regression. Our speciﬁc objectives are:
• to assess the feasibility of producing species speciﬁc basal area maps for trees that survived the ﬁre for
burned area using Quickbird data and machine learning methods
• to identify species speciﬁc diﬀerences of the spatial distribution of pre-ﬁre basal area
• to assess the spatial distribution and structure of residual stands with respect to topographic variations
2. Data and Methods
2.1. Data
Field data. We studied two burned areas located near to Zotino (about 5 to 10 km east of the Yennissey river)
in the Abies sibirica (ﬁr) and Picea obovata (spruce) dominated dark taiga zone of the Central Siberian Plateau
(Figure 1). The ﬁre area F4 of 8.4 km2 burned in 1990, the other one F6 of 23.4 km2 burned in 1999, while at
least parts burned already before in 1965 (ages determined dendrochronologically). During two extensive ﬁeld
expeditions in 2007 and 2008 we installed in total 157 plots (71 on F4, 86 on F6) with GPS coordinates along
transects through the burned areas as well as in the unburned forest edge and measured the diameter at breast
height DBH of ﬁr and spruce trees with DBH > 10cm. Here, only trees that survived the ﬁre are accounted for (no
regeneration) because we are primarily interested in their role as potential seed sources (see [9]). The plot sizes Ai
were commonly 14 x 14 meters but were adapted to the local density of individuals i of diﬀerent size classes and
species (details are available in [9]).

where pi is the probability of tree i being recruited pre-ﬁre (obtained from a statistical model based on extensive
dendrochronological and biometric data from the ﬁre areas [9]).
Quickbird data. We acquired Quickbird satellite data from two diﬀerent acquisition dates for F4 and F6 because
both ﬁre areas were not covered by one single Quickbird scene. The Quickbird data were taken on 24th June 2003
and 30th July 2003 for both F4 and F6. Quickbird provides a ultra-high spatial resolution images with pixel sizes
of 0.6 m in the panchromatic channel and of 2.4 m multispectral. Quickbird measures in four spectral ranges:
450-520 nm (blue), 520-600 nm (green), 630-690 nm (red), and 760-900 nm (near infrared, NIR). The Quickbird
products were radiometrically calibrated using ENVI 4.5.
We calculated the normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI, [18]), enhanced vegetation index (EVI,
[19]), modiﬁed enhanced vegetation index that omits the blue band (EVI2, [20]), and the modiﬁed soil adjusted
vegetation index (MSAVI, ref):

Digital elevation model. We used a digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM version2) to analyze how residual
stands vary with topography. It was acquired from http://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/, and comes with a spatial resolution of 1 arc second. We reprojected the DEM to UTM, Zone 45 North to conform with the Quickbird based basal
area maps, and resampled it to a spatial resolution of 28m resolution.

2.2. Methods
2.2.1. Machine learning methods
Random Forests regression. We use the non-parametric regression algorithm Random Forests [21] to ﬁnd a model
that predicts basal area from the explanatory variables. Random Forests is an ensemble of nT rees regression trees,
where the individual trees were trained based on a bootstrap sample [22] of the training data set. The individual
regression trees are fully grown without pruning until the leaf nodes inhabit at least S plitMin examples. Random Forests makes further use of the Random Subspace Method [23], where only a random subset of predictors
nS plitVar is searched for the best split at a given node. One advantage of Random Forests is that an unbiased
estimate of the performance can be obtained from the training using the out-of-bag examples of each tree in the
ensemble. Here, each tree predicts the examples that were not used in constructing the tree, and averaging all
available predictions per example provides the cross-validated prediction of the response variable Ycv .
Feature selection algorithm. We use the Guided Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GHGA, [24]) to identify suitable
variable subsets for the prediction of basal area. GHGA is a feature selection algorithm that combines a Genetic
Algorithm with guided variable elimination and is tailored to the problem where (1) the number of variables
required for a good ﬁt is not known, (2) the evaluation of the cost function is expensive because it involves
frequent trainings of a machine learning algorithm, and (3) one cannot assume that uninformative variables do not
harm (i.e. in sparse domains with a large ratio of number of variables to training examples). GHGA is wrapped
around a base learning algorithm, here Random Forests, and repeatedly calls it with diﬀerent feature subsets to
evaluate the performance. GHGA uses a dynamic cost function j, which is the sum of the number of included
variables nc1 for feature subset c, and a penalty term p for the suboptimal performance measured by the modeling
eﬃciency m [25]. The penalty term depends further on a tolerance parameter , and the largest modeling eﬃciency
found so far max (MA ).
j(c) = nc1 + p(m(c), max (MA ), ) ,
p(m(c), max (MA ), ) = e[max (MA )−m(c)]

where Y is the observed response variable, and YCV is the cross-validated modeled response variable. The behavior
of the cost function is such that the penalty for suboptimal performance is small as long as it stays within the
tolerance , and rapidly increases when the performance is poor. Hence, the cost function value is primarily
controlled by the penalty term when the performance associated with the current feature subset is poor (outside
the tolerance margin: max (MA ) − m(c) > ) and otherwise by the number of included features. Since max (MA )
changes over the course of the search, cost function values also change and are recomputed in such cases (dynamic
cost function).
2.2.2. Estimating basal area
General approach. We ﬁrst compute various statistical measures from Quickbird data for all plot locations to
yield a large set of potentially informative predictor variables. Then we use a feature selection algorithm to identify
suitable variable subsets that optimally predict pre-ﬁre basal area for spruce and ﬁr. The identiﬁed variable subsets
are then used to compute spatially explicit basal area estimates using the Quickbird data only. We use a digital
elevation model to visualize and analyze relationships between topography and basal area of the burned areas.
In our approach we do not extract explicitly diﬀerent vegetation types or what grew before or after the ﬁre
from the satellite data in the ﬁrst place; this is rather implicit in the way the response variables are formed and it
is the task of the machine learning algorithms to ﬁnd appropriate relations with the predictor variables.

2390

Candidate predictors. For each plot location, we extracted Quickbird data for a 14x14mwindow for the available
scenes and calculated mean, variance, coeﬃcient of variation (standard deviation / mean), and percentiles (1st, 5th,
10th, 25th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th) for the panchromatic channel, all multispectral channels, and all vegetation indexes. The mean value and various measures that describe the distribution of the values within the 14x14mwindow
should help to pick up both, diﬀerences in foliage, as well as diﬀerences in stand structure. In addition, shadow
eﬀects that can be useful for biomass estimation [26] are captured implicitly. We further considered acquisition
date and ﬁre area as categorical predictors such that we yield a set of 101 variables.
Feature selection and training. GHGA was run separately for spruce and ﬁr using the cost function and default
settings [24]. The termination criterion for GHGA was that it stops if no improvements were found within the last
500 function evaluations (trainings). We used an ensemble of 120 trees for Random Forests, and set S plitMin = 1
(determined empirically). We controlled the random number generator such that in each training using a diﬀerent
feature subset, exactly the same bootstrap samples are taken to minimize subtle diﬀerences in performance due to
the stochastic nature of Random Forests. The ﬁnal training of Random Forests uses the feature subset with the
smallest cost function value returned by GHGA.
Mapping basal area. The required variables returned by GHGA for spruce and ﬁr were computed for all Quickbird scenes using a 14x14m moving window, and the trained models for spruce and ﬁr were applied. The resulting
basal area maps for each Quickbird scene were mosaicked using ENVI 4.5 to archive a full coverage of the burned
areas F4 and F6 respectively, while we used a histogram matching algorithm to remove residual diﬀerences due
to acquisition dates. The basal area mosaics were resampled to 28m using bi-linear interpolation for subsequent
analysis that involves a digital elevation model at that resolution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Feature selection, training, and validation
The feature selection tested 3802 and 4302 diﬀerent combinations of variables for spruce and ﬁr respectively.
The results show clearly the importance of feature selection (Figure 2) - for spruce the model containing all
variables (101) is substantially worse (modeling eﬃciency of 0.28) in comparison to the best variable subset with
6 variables (modeling eﬃciency of 0.55). This is typical for a training data set with a large ratio of candidate
variables to examples [27].
We infer variable importance of the ﬁnal variable by computing two metrics (Figure 2): the change in modeling
eﬃciency if a variable is dropped from the set (’leave out’), and the change in mean squared error if a variable
is randomly permuted (i.e. destroying the information content). The ﬁrst metric measures the relevance or added
value of a variable, while the second metric measures the sensitivity of the model to the variable. For spruce we
ﬁnd ﬁre area number (the categorical variable that distinguishes the two ﬁre areas) as most relevant, while the
model seems most sensitive to the 10th percentile of the red reﬂectance. For ﬁr, the permutation and leave out
test indicate the largest importance of 75th percentile of the blue and 1st percentile of the panchromatic channel.
The information by the 1st percentile of the panchromatic channel might reﬂect shadow fractions that yields
information on biomass [26]. For both species we note that the selected variables are mainly percentiles that
are rather low or high while the median or mean was never selected. This indicates the usefulness of structural
information rather than average spectra for predicting basal area from high resolution remote sensing data.

The cross-validation of the trained models show correlations of 0.74, 0.77, and 0.8 with the observations
for spruce, ﬁr, and the sum of the two. This result is acceptable given that we aim at estimating basal area for
individual tree species for diverse spots rather than total biomass including deciduous pioneer trees (which are
ubiquitous) and the understorey. Some error is also likely introduced by insuﬃciently precise GPS coordinates
that are diﬃcult to obtain in Central Siberia. Additional information such as multi-temporal complete coverage of
the ﬁre areas during key phenological stages of deciduous trees and the understorey (spring, summer, autumn) as
well as higher order textural measures of the spatial arrangement could have helped to improve the results but was
not available or not explored.
3.2. Spatial estimates of species speciﬁc basal area and its topographic control
The species speciﬁc basal area maps reveal diﬀerences in the distribution of basal area for spruce and ﬁr
(Figure 3). In the unburned region of F4 the basal area of spruce shows a much more homogeneous distribution
than the basal area of ﬁr which is much lower in the eastern part in comparison to the northern and south western
part of the region. Within the ﬁre area the fraction of spruce is higher around the residual stands than in the parts
with little post-ﬁre basal area (high ﬁre severity). This might either suggest that spruce is slightly more resistant

Fig. 5. Basal area [m2 /ha] of ﬁr + spruce, elevation, and the moving window correlation between elevation and basal area (moving window of
1 km2) for the two burned areas F6 (top) and F4 (bottom).

Increasing basal area with elevation in the unburned parts suggests better growth conditions here, presumably
because of less wet soils in comparison to the depressions and channels that often had gley and pseudogley soils
(not shown). Fire spread due to topography is lower on ridges and plateaus, which together with enhanced fuel load
and drier conditions likely caused severe ﬁres there. The wetter conditions in the depressions and channels along
with less fuel availability likely caused less severe ﬁres there with more residual stands, which is consistent with
previous ﬁndings that drainage conditions are the primary control of direct ﬁre emissions in boreal ecosystems
[3].
The topographic control of the distribution of residual stands may have some important implications for the
carbon dynamics and the successional pathways of ﬁre areas in Central Siberia. The enhanced prevalence of
residual stands in the depressions at low altitudes serves as a buﬀering mechanism for carbon emissions, which is
likely a challenging feature for global ﬁre models and might cause overestimated ﬁre emissions.
The coniferous species in Central Siberia need to recolonize the burned area by seeding into the area, but
exhibit rather low dispersal distances. Therefore, the distribution of residual stands is crucial for the regeneration
of the boreal forest, at least for ﬁre areas of a few square kilometers or larger where the edge of the unburned
forest is far away for most places in the burned area. Our ﬁndings that residual stands tend to be less frequent or
absent on plateaus and ridges where ﬁre severity was large might explain the in the ﬁeld observed prevalence of
deciduous forests (Danillo Mollicone, pers. comm.) on plateaus and ridges. Deciduous trees (primarily birch) are
pioneers that typically dominate approximately the ﬁrst 100-150 years after ﬁre in Central Siberian dark taiga [28].
In contrast to spruce and ﬁr, birch is much less limited by dispersal. Due to the high ﬁre severity insuﬃcient seed
sources might be available for the conifers to recolonize the plateaus and ridges, possibly leading to deciduous
forests that are stable over a longer time period in comparison to more lowland regions with abundant seed sources.
Recently, it was postulated that the successional pathways in Central Siberia might shift towards more decidu-

2394

ous species dominated trajectories if ﬁres become more severe and leave fewer coniferous seed sources within the
burned area [9]. Such a scenario would have further implications to regional and possibly global climate via biogeochemical and especially biophysical (esp. albedo) feedbacks. Residual stands could be classiﬁed into ’event
speciﬁc’ refugia that are due to ﬁre characteristics and the stochastic nature of ﬁre spread, and ’inherent’ refugia
that largely originate from the topography. Our results indicates the occurrence of such ’inherent’ refugia such
that the local topography aﬀects the sensitivity to such a potential biome shift, with regions of a larger topographic
complexity being less sensitive than regions with lower topographic complexity.
4. Conclusions
We used in-situ measurements in conjunction with high resolution satellite imagery from Quickbird and machine learning approaches to map basal area for spruce and ﬁr of two burned areas in Central Siberia. Our approach
demonstrated that estimating species speciﬁc basal area in diverse ecosystems is feasible. Multi-temporal images,
advanced textural measures and potentially other data sources such as LIDAR would likely improve our results.
We found pronounced relationships of the distribution of residual stands with topography. Residual stands
were often located in channels and depressions and often absent on better drained uplands due to the direct and
indirect topographic controls on ﬁre spread and severity. Topographically induced variations of residual stands
implies diﬀerent landscape scale sensitivities of ecological processes like recolonization after ﬁre to (changing)
ﬁre regimes. An extensive analysis based on many ﬁre areas of diﬀerent ages, sizes, and structures would be
desirable to assess the relevance of this eﬀect for the entire Central Siberian dark taiga.
