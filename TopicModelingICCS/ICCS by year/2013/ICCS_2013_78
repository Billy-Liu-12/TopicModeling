Abstract
A surface mesh generation method for describing and applying the large-scale 3D digital rock images is presented in this
paper. The accurate description of rock structure needs high resolution digital images involving a huge number of voxels,
which make it difficult and even impossible to directly use in conventional numerical analysis (e.g. FEM and FVM). In
addition, as regards to processing such large-scale original data itself, computer capability and efficiency are also quite
challenging. We proposed a meshing method based on a simplified centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to efficiently
describe the rock structures with acceptable element quantity and quality and apply for further simulation and processing.
The method is implemented in the following steps: (1) extracting material interfaces in rock images; (2) creating a
background mesh with size field on the surfaces; (3) generating nodes with a simplified CVT method; (4) constructing and
optimising triangular meshes with the above nodes. A one-billion-voxel rock image is utilized to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

1. Introduction
With the development of advanced imaging technology such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), digital images are nowadays widely accepted and used in many areas to describe the
complicated structures such as in mining [1], medicine [2] and material science [3]. For rock images, higher
resolution is required to describe the finer objects in more details. Due to the huge voxel quantity in such
images, it is impossible to be analysed by the conventional numerical methods such as finite element/finite
volume simulations [4-7]. Additionally, as regards to accurate simulations, meshes with high element quality

are also expected. Therefore, it is crucial to generate appropriate meshes for achieving image-based numerical
simulations. Although researchers [8-12] have studied the image mesh generation for decades, it is still
challenging to creating meshes for large-scale rock images with complex structures. Thereby, it is the focus of
this paper.
1.1. 3D digital image mesh generation
The digital rock images are multi-material due to the existence of cracks and mineral matter. Most of the
multi-material image meshing approaches [8-10] create tetrahedron/hexahedron mesh from 3D multi-material
image directly and then refine the material interfaces. Boltcheva et al. [10] proposed a Delaunay-based mesh
generation to preserve material interfaces, which relies on sampling corners and edges from the input image
and to constrain boundaries. However, this method fails when a sharp dihedral angle exists on material
interfaces. Zhang et al. [9] developed an octree-based isocontouring method to mesh digital image. Due to the
inherent drawback of octree-based method, elements on material interfaces could not maintain a good quality.
Lederman et al. [8] employed a grid-based approach to generate initial tetrahedral mesh, and then performed
mesh improvement on related material interfaces but with an enormous number of additional elements and
nodes generated. Distinct from the above methods, the approach proposed by Wu and Sullivan [11] extends the
matching cubes method [12] to address digital image mesh generation. However, the generated surface mesh
has a large number of elements, which will lead to a huge volume element quantity. As regards the element
quantity, mesh coarsening approaches could be utilized to further reduce it. Moreover, as volume meshes
depend on its surface counterparts, surface coarsening approaches could also provide researchers a flexible way
to control volume meshes for multi-material images.
1.2. Surface mesh coarsening
Mesh coarsening is essential for the image meshes extracted through the marching cubes method [11].
Additionally, a high element quality is also requested concerning further effective numerical simulation. A
number of methods have been proposed in the field of mesh coarsening, which could be roughly classified into
three groups: decimation, scattering and remeshing. Decimation approaches [13, 14] reduce the number of
elements through a series of elementary simplifications such as collapsing edge and merging face. These
operations are efficient but they could produce a number of thin or flat elements with low element quality.
Moreover, distorted elements would be generated by the elementary simplifications. Vertex scattering is
another category of coarsening approaches [15-17]. In these methods, vertices are firstly scattered on the
surface. Then their positions are refined until a given precision is reached. CVT [18] based approaches [16, 17]
belong to this category. Due to the solid theoretical background, they could generate high element quality.
However, the construction of Voronoi diagram is time-consuming and thus it is not suitable for processing
large-scale data. Besides the above two groups of methods, remeshing approaches [19-21] could also be
utilized to coarsen meshes. However, these approaches focus on element gradation and shape rather than mesh
coarsening. And thus they are not efficient for large-scale image meshing.
The method proposed in this paper focuses on generating mesh for large-scale digital images. Specifically, a
marching cube method is firstly employed to extract an initial surface mesh from a digital image. In the next
step, we devise a simplified CVT to create vertices on 3D surface. Lastly, an adaptively coarsened mesh is
constructed through connecting the above vertices. A 3D rock image with 1.0×109 voxels is utilized to
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

2. Proposed algorithm and implementation
2.1. Background mesh generation
The background mesh is generated from a surface mesh extracted from material interfaces in digital images.
Multi-material marching cubes algorithm [11] is adopted here to extract the interface meshes. As shown in Fig.
1, interfaces are extracted as triangular meshes and their junctions are indicated by bolder lines. The interface
junctions will be split and then interface meshes are separated from each other.

Fig. 1. Extracted material interface meshes. The border lines are junctions of different interfaces

A separate interface is a manifold surface mesh and the mesh boundaries are the interface junctions. This
mesh is utilized as the background mesh for the future coarsening process. Sizing field of this mesh is
generated by the following steps. Firstly, the interface junctions are adaptively segmented by a customized size
Sseg. Secondly, according to the junction segments, the sizing field is established as below. For a node i on the
background mesh, its size hi is calculated by the following function.
(1)
Where node j is one of the vicinities of i, li,j is the distance between node i and j, hj is the size of node j, Smax is
the expected maximum size, q is the gradation ratio. After sizing field construction, the length ei,j of edge (i , j)
is defined by the size of its two ends (i.e. node i and j)
.

2.2. Mesh coarsening
The mesh coarsening method proposed here belongs to the vertex scattering approach. We devise a
simplified (CVT) [18] to achieve an efficient scattering process on a 3D triangular surface. And then a node
removal and edge swap operation are combined to generate the coarsened mesh.

the Voronoi diagram is defined as

A centroidal Voronoi diagram is a Voronoi diagram where the generator

On a triangular mesh, the Voronoi cell consists of a set of triangle elements. Therefore, its mass centroid is
approximated by:

Where is the Voronoi cell on the triangular mesh, is a triangle in and is the mass centroid of .
According to function (2), denotes the area calculated through the background mesh. For a triangle T (i, j, k),
its area is calculated as below:
(6)
2.2.2. Vertex scattering
According to the size field in the background mesh M, a standard triangle area A is given as input. A large A
will lead to a sparse mesh after coarsening. The initial vertex set Z is obtained through the following algorithm.
Algorithm 1: Vertex scattering

for constructing Voronoi diagram on the background
The nodes gathered in Z are the generators
mesh. As the background mesh is generated through the marching cubes method [11], the triangle elements are
mostly similar with each other in both size and shape. Therefore, the Voronoi diagram could be constructed in a
simplified way as below:
Algorithm 2: Voronoi diagram construction
Treat the element linked with as the initial Voronoi cell
WHILE there is element not belonging to
FOR EACH in

END
END
To achieve a centroid Voronoi Diagram, to generators should be updated by the function (5). The updating
implementation is illustrated as below:
Algorithm 3: Generator updating
STEP 1: Calculate the mass centroid of through function (5)
STEP 2: Find a node which is closest to the mass centroid in and substitute it for
The CVT is constructed by iteratively processing Algorithm 2 and 3. As this construction process is
and
will be approximately converged though alternately invoking
convergent by theory [18],
Algorithm 2 and 3 several times.
2.2.3. Vertex scattering
All the CVT generators as well as boundary segment nodes are kept for the coarsened mesh. The other
nodes will be removed through a series of edge-swap operations [15]. After node removal, an optimization
approach will be utilized to further improve the element quality of the coarsened mesh. This optimization is
based on the edge swap operation. Specifically, for each edge shared by two triangles on the mesh, map the
triangles on the same plane and swap the edge according the empty circle criterion. This optimization operation
improves the element quality as it can connect generators in an approximate Delaunay triangulation manner.
2.3. Numerical applications
The method proposed in this paper is utilized to generate mesh for the rock digital images. Firstly, a piece of
rock interface is utilized to describe the implementation details of this method. Then a rock image with 1.0×109
voxels is meshed, which demonstrates the ability of the proposed method in processing large-scale data.
As shown in Fig. 2, this is a piece of interface for a rock digital image. Firstly, the background mesh
(270,264 elements) is extracted by the marching cube method, and its size field is generated through Function
(1) and (2) with the parameters Sseg=5, Smax=20 and q=1.3. Fig. 2 (a) is the background mesh and corresponding
size field in colours where red respects large size and blue respects small size. Secondly, we choose standard
(which is the area of a regular triangle) to generate the initial scattering vertices and process
area
Algorithm 2 and 3 for five times to achieve an approximate centroid Voronoi diagram on this background
mesh. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), the vertices (white plots) are roughly located in the mass centroid of the

corresponding Voronoi cells (distinct from each other by different colours). Fig. 2 (c) is the mesh generated
from the above vertices, which has only 4,046 elements.

The proposed method has been utilized to generate mesh for the digital image in practice. One of such
examples is illustrated in Fig. 3 (a), which is a piece of rock in a 10×10×10cm3 box represented by a
1024×1024×1024 digital image. Cracks and mineral matter are indicated by different colours and opacities. The
image has more than 1.0×109 voxels and the extracted background surface mesh has 1.0×108 elements. We
process the mesh coarsening on a supercomputer named Barrine (www.hpcu.uq.edu.au) with parameters as
. The whole mesh generation process costs 39GB memory and 01:36:54
Sseg=5, Smax=40, q=1.3 and
CPU time, which creates a mesh with 6.3×105 elements. The coarsening speed is approximate 1.0×106
elements/minute. Fig. 3 (b) is the mesh without grid lines and the thick lines indicate interface junctions. Fig. 3
(c) is the mesh with grid lines and (d) is an interior close-up. As shown in Table 1, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 are four
different element quality measures [22]. The average element quality of the generated mesh is quite close to the
one of a regular triangle.

3. Conclusion and future work
This paper proposes a mesh approach for 3D large-scale rock digital images. The approach is achieved by a
simplified CVT which is based on the triangular background mesh. A numerical experiment has demonstrated
its effectiveness and robustness. Therefore, the following conclusions are drawn:
(1) The proposed method is effective in creating surface meshes for complicated 3D rock digital images in
practice.
(2) The mesh coarsening in the proposed method is efficient to process large-scale rock images. Its speed is
1.0×106 elements/minute in the mesh generation for a one-billion-voxel image.
(3) The proposed method could generate adaptive mesh with high element quality. The average element
quality of the generated mesh is close to the one of a regular triangle.
Future work includes introducing parallel computing in the process of mesh coarsening to further increasing
the mesh generation speed. Moreover, based on our previous 2D quadrilateral researches [23, 24], we will
focus on 3D quadrilateral image meshing as well as the related hexahedral mesh generation.
