Abstract
The study on the application of unstructured grids in solving two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates (r-z) problems is
scarce, since one of the challenges is the accurate calculation of the control volumes. In this paper, an unstructured gridsbased discretization method, in the framework of a finite volume approach, is proposed for the solution of the convectiondiffusion equation in an r-z coordinate. Numerical simulations are presented for the natural convection problem. The
numerical results of the proposed method are found to be accurate. The employment of unstructured grids leads to
flexibility of the discretization method for irregular domains of any shapes.

1. Introduction
Cylindrical symmetrical problems are usually involved in the calculations of heat transfer and fluid flow.
In many cases, due to the symmetry of the computation domain and the solution of the physical problem, the
numerical solution of the flow equations could be greatly simplified by expressing both the governing
equations and the initial/boundary conditions in a two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system. Actually,
many practical problems could be simplified from three-dimensional ones to two-dimensional ones (r-z or r- ).

Some previous applications of the two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates to the solution of the threedimensional cylindrical symmetrical problems are listed below. Bilgili and Ataer [1] investigated the heat and
mass transfer for hydrogen absorption in an annular metal hydride bed by a two-dimensional cylindrical
coordinate system. Oliveski et al. [2] analyzed the velocity and temperature fields inside a tank submitted to
internal natural and mixed convection using a two-dimensional model in the cylindrical coordinate system
through the finite volume method. Yang and Tsai [3] presented a numerical study of transient conjugate heat
transfer in a high turbulence air jet impinging over a flat circular disk using a finite volume method in the twodimensional cylindrical coordinate system. Oliveski et al. [4] investigated the thermal stratification inside a
tank containing thermal oil by a two-dimensional model in the cylindrical coordinate system with the finite
volumes method. Sievers et al. [5] employed a two-dimensional anisotropic cylindrical coordinate model with
linear triangular finite elements to simulate the steady-state temperature distribution within the Li-ion cells.
The computational domains in previous reports [1-6] are all regular ones, and are all discretized by
orthogonal grids. A few reports [7] presented the employment of unstructured grids in two-dimensional
plane (actually a polar coordinate
cylindrical problems, but their concern was the physical problem in r
system), neglecting the gradient in z direction, and thus is different from the issue we concern in the r z plane.
To the author’s knowledge, the study on the applications of unstructured grids in the solution of convectiondiffusion problems in two-dimensional r z coordinates is not found, and the discretization method especially
the calculation of the control volume has not been reported.

A regular r z cylindrical symmetrical domain could be mapped by completely orthogonal grids; while
an irregular r z domain could not be mapped by orthogonal grids directly, but could be perfectly mapped by
unstructured grids. If the unstructured grids are applied in a two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system
( r z ), one challenge is the accurate calculation of the control volume. For structured grids, the calculation of
the control volume is easy, i.e. Vi 0.5rP rP zP , since rP and z P0 are available on a given mesh. But for the
unstructured grids in a two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system, as the grid face is not parallel to the
coordinate axes, plus different grid cells are of different shapes and sizes, the calculation of such control
volumes is complicated.
In this article, an unstructured grids-based discretization method, in the framework of a finite volume
approach, is proposed for the solution of the convection-diffusion equations in r z coordinates, and
especially an accurate calculation method of the control volumes is presented. After that, the discretization
method is validated by a well-designed numerical case.

Eqs. (15) (18) are applicable to any coordinate system with different calculations of surface element area

coordinate system,

Aj

rP0 rP0 (the upper and lower

0.5rP0 rP0 z P0 (shown in Fig. 1(a)). For unstructured

grids in a two-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system, the calculation of each face factor is also easy to
perform, i.e. Aj rj L j (here rj is the r coordinate of the midpoint at jth boundary segment, and L j is the
length of the jth boundary segment), but the calculation of control volume is complicated since the control
volume is an irregular pentahedron as sketched in Fig. 1(b), of which the size and shape are dependent on the
relative position of the three vertexes. The calculation of the control volume could not be determined by the
same procedures as structured grids’ and require complicated procedures which will be proposed in the
following section.

2.2 An accurate calculation method of unstructured control volumes in a two-dimensional cylindrical
coordinate system
In this section, an accurate calculation method of the unstructured control volume is proposed. It is known
that, a solid of revolution formed by rotating a right trapezoid by 360 degrees is a circular truncated cone as
shown in Fig. 2, the volume of which is easy to calculate by

Fig. 2 Circular truncated cone formed by rotating a right trapezoid by 360 degrees

A right trapezoid can be constructed by each edge of the triangular cell, two lines parallel to r-axis, plus zaxis. The right trapezoids involving edges AB, BC and AC are named A1, A2 and A3 respectively, and examples
could be found in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) . Since the area of the triangular cell is the algebraic sum of A1, A2
and A3, the solid of revolution by rotating the triangle ABC about z-axis by 360 degrees could be determined by
the combination of three circular truncated cones formed by rotating A1, A2 and A3.
Define vertex A is the one with the smallest r, B is the one with the greater z between the others two points
and C is the remaining one. The coordinates of A, B and C are respectively r1 , z1 , r2 , z2 and r3 , z3 . Due to
the different relative positions of the three vertexes of a triangular cell, algebraic sum of A1, A2 and A3 may be
different.
Based on the above assumptions, there are 6 different relative positions of the three vertexes of a triangle,
i.e. ( z1 z3 z2 and r2 r3 ), ( z1 z3 z2 and r2 r3 ), ( z3 z2 z1 and r2 r3 ), ( z3 z2 z1 and r2 r3 ),
( z3 z1 z2 and r2 r3 ) and ( z3 z1 z2 and r2 r3 ). If z1 z3 z2 or z3 z2 z1 , the area of triangular ABC
is S ABC A1 A2 A3 regardless of r. If z3 z1 z2 the area of triangular ABC is S ABC A2 A1 A3
regardless of r. So, there are only two situations in total, i.e. z1 z3 z2 or z3 z2 z1 (situation 1, Fig. 3(a)),
and z3 z1 z2 (situation 2, Fig. 3(b)).
For situation 1, taking r2 r3 as an example, the combination and split method to determine the control
volume is shown in Fig. 3(a). The stereogram of the triangular control volume is shown in Fig. 4(a).
Since S ABC A1 A3 A2 and V1 , V2 and V3 can be calculated by Eq. (18), we have,

For situation 2, taking r2 r3 for example, the combination and split method is shown in Fig. 3(b). The

Similarly with situation 1, we have,

The unstructured control volume could be determined conveniently by the above mentioned combination
and split methods. Although the method is performed on the triangular grids, same procedures could be
straightforwardly extended to that on an unstructured quadrilateral grids system.

3. Numerical examples and results discussions

An example is well devised for an irregular domain to verify the correctness of the proposed unstructured
grids-based discretization method. In this Example, the natural convection in an irregular cylindrical cavity is
investigated. The three-dimensional cavity is a solid of revolution formed by rotating the geometry shape
shown in Fig. 5 about z-axis by 360 degrees. In the figure, the length of the upper boundary is r2-r1=H=1m, the
height H=1m, and the length of the lower boundary L=0.4m. The right curve boundary is determined by a cubic
curve defined as z

. The left and right boundaries are of the first-type boundary conditions,

with higher temperature of Th at the left boundary and cooler temperature of Tc on the right one and insulated
boundary condition for the upper and lower boundaries.
Figure 6 presents the structured and unstructured grid systems (a coarse one) for the irregular domain. For
the irregular domain shown in Fig. 5, it is impossible to map it with orthogonal structured grids, but it can be
mapped perfectly by the unstructured grids such as triangular grids Fig. 6(b).
To validate the proposed method, the irregular domain is involved in a square domain shown in Fig. 6(a),
and this square domain could be mapped by orthogonal structured grids. Under this circumstance, the boundary

The numerical example demonstrated above indicates that the proposed unstructured grids-based
discretization method for the convection-diffusion equations is reasonable and accurate.

4. Conclusions

This article proposes an unstructured grids-based discretization method for the convection-diffusion
equations in r-z coordinate, in the framework of a finite volume approach. Numerical results have validated the
correctness of the proposed method. Although, the proposed discretization method is performed only on
unstructured triangular grids, it could be readily extended to that on an unstructured quadrilateral grids system.
The study provides great convenience for the application of unstructured grids in a two-dimensional cylindrical
coordinate system, leading to the flexibility of the discretization method for the irregular domains of any shapes.
