Abstract
This study introduces the Boundary Averaged Multi-moment Constrained ﬁnite-Volume (BAMCV) scheme for 1-D transport with Hermite Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (HWENO)
limiting using the ADER Diﬀerential Transform (ADER-DT) time discretization. The BAMCV scheme evolves a cell average using a Finite-Volume (FV) scheme, and it adds further
constraints as point wise derivatives of the state at cell boundaries, which are evolved in strong
form using PDE derivatives. The resulting scheme maintains a Maximum Stable CFL (MSCFL)
value of one no matter how high-order the scheme is. Also, parallel communication requirements
are very low and will be described. h-reﬁnement experiments demonstrate proper convergence
order, and p-reﬁnement experiments demonstrate expected exponential convergence. The overall ADER-DT + BA-MCV + HWENO scheme is a scalable and larger time step alternative to
Galerkin methods for multi-moment ﬂuid simulation in climate and weather applications.

Introduction

In the modern era of computing, schemes with minimal parallel communication are preferred.
Over the last decade, Galerkin methods have made a surge in the climate and weather community [10, 2]. They require minimal parallel communication across domain decomposition
boundaries. They also enjoy great accuracy because they are multi-moment. Also, they can be
limited in a variety of ways including Hermite Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (HWENO)
reconstructions [9]. However, a major downfall of Galerkin methods is the stringent constraint
on the time step, which reduces almost quadratically with increasing element order.
There have been some studies on Multi-Moment Finite-Volume (MMFV) methods [6, 7].
They perform well for smooth problems and maintain a maximum stable CFL (MSCFL) value
of one no matter how high-order. However, they were found too oscillatory in the presence of
discontinuous data. Thus, the Boundary-Averaged Multi-moment Constrained ﬁnite-Volume

(BA-MCV) approach is investigated here, which has many similarities to the original MCV
method [4]. BA-MCV is signiﬁcantly less oscillatory than MMFV, yet it shares the property
that the MSCFL value remains one no matter how many moments are used.
Additionally, the ADER time discretization [11] is advantageous in parallel because it allows
one-step, one-stage simulation for any temporal order of accuracy, as opposed to multi-stage
methods. It also preserves non-oscillatory properties in the time discretization automatically.
The ADER-DT [6, 8] time discretization will be used with the BA-MCV schemes. Finally, to
maintain robustness in the presence of discontinuities, an HWENO limiting scheme of the type
of [7] will be used. The overall result is a large time step, multi-moment, high-order-accurate,
single-stage, robustly limited time step.
The numerical formulation for the MCV schemes, ADER-DT time discretization, and
HWENO limiting is given in section 2. Simulation results are detailed and discussed in section
3, and ﬁnally, conclusions are drawn in section 4.

Numerical Formulation
Degrees of Freedom and Evolution Equations

Consider a PDE system in 1-D: ∂q/∂t + ∂f /∂x = 0, subject to the initial condition q (x, 0) =
q0 (x), on a periodic domain. A uniform, Cartesian grid is composed of non-overlapping cells,
Ωi ∈ xi−1/2 , xi+1/2 , where xi±1/2 = xi ± Δx/2. The discrete degrees of freedom are cellintegrated averages along and a series of point values and derivatives located at cell interfaces.

upwind value is used. Note that the pointwise moments, qi,n , are updated entirely locally.
All that is needed to close the scheme are high-order space-time polynomials, qi,n (x, t) and
fi,n (x, t).
The schemes will be labeled as follows: MCV-M -N , where M is the number of distinct
moments per cell, and N is the order of accuracy of the overall scheme. Higher-order-accurate
methods can be constructed by using adjacent cell information to construct an even higherorder-accurate polynomial in the reconstruction phase. This is similar to any traditional ﬁnitevolume stencil-based reconstruction, but it is more local. To the author’s best knowledge, it is
also the ﬁrst 7th-order-accurate 4-moment MCV scheme implemented and tested.

2.2

Hermite WENO Limiting

This is considered a Hermite WENO scheme because multiple moments per cell are used in
the overall WENO reconstruction. For sake of brevity, the only WENO limiting used here is
weighted sum of three quadratic polynomials. There are two parameters to consider in a tuning
sense, and the rest is agnostic to the high-order spatial operator.

There are four polynomials used as input to the WENO limiting process: qH (x), qL (x),
qC (x), and qR (x). The high-order polynomial, qH , comes from MCV-M-N reconstruction.
Also passed into the WENO limiting routine is a stencil of ﬁve cell averages, q i+s , where
s ∈ {−2, . . . , 2}. The left quadratic, qL , is constrained to match q i−2 , q i−1 , and q i . The center
quadratic, qC , is constrained to match q i−1 , q i , and q i+1 . Finally, the right quadratic, qR , is constrained to match q i , q i+1 , and q i+2 . Next, a set of ideal weights, {γB , γL , γC , γR }, is chosen by
the user. It can be any set of positive, bounded real numbers that sum to unity. Next, a “bridge
polynomial”, pB , is computed as pB (x) = (pH (x) − γL pL (x) − γC pC (x) − γR pR (x)) /γB .
Now, the Total Variation (TV) over all derivatives is computed for pB and for the quadrat2

ics. TV is deﬁned here as: T Vξ = Δx
j=1 ∂xj pξ (x)
Ωi
where N is the largest derivative of the polynomial. Next, T VB is “handicapped” by:
T VB = T VB + σ 13 (T VL + T VC + T VR ) − T VB , where σ ∈ [0, 1] is a tuning parameter. When
σ = 0, T VB remains unchanged. When σ = 1, T VB is equal to the average TV of the quadratics.
Next, the limited weights, {ωB , ωL , ωC , ωR }, are computed based on the TV estimates as:
ωi = ωi / i ωi , where ωi = γi / (T Vip + ), i ∈ {B, L, C, R}, p = 2, and is a small number
chosen to avoid division by zero. Finally, the limited WENO interpolant is computes using
limited weights: pW EN O (x) = ωB pB (x) + ωL pL (x) + ωC pC (x) + ωR pR (x). For multi-moment
methods, one must replace existing DOFs with HWENO-limited values. This way, the existing
data is compatible with the resulting ﬂux. This is why replacing boundary DOFs with the
interface upwind state is required: to keep them shared between cells with as little parallel
communication as possible.
Each simulation applies the weight mapping procedure of [3] once to the limited weights.
The tunable parameters are the user-chosen ideal weights, γ, and the T VB nudging parameter,
σ. The ideal weights are speciﬁed as using {γB , γL , γC , γR }, and then γi = γi / i γi . γL and γR
are always set to one. γC is always set to six. Therefore, two parameters remain: γB and σ. For
all methods, σ = 0.99. For BA-MCV-2-3, γB = 3 × 103 . For BA-MCV-2-5 and BA-MCV-4-7 ,
γB = 104 . For BA-MCV-2-7, γB = 2 × 104 . For BA-MCV-3-5 and BA-MCV-3-7, γB = 4 × 103 .
There is no claim of optimality for these parameters.
ADER-DT (see [6, 5, 1]) is used to for the functions, qi,n (x, t) and fi,n (x, t), over each
domain, Ωi × [tn , tn+1 ] in order to close the scheme.

Results and Discussion

All simulations are performed on a domain of [0, 1] for three revolutions with periodic boundary
conditions, and all simulations use a CFL value of 0.9. The sine wave test case is designed to
test the polynomial and exponential convergence of the MCV schemes for a smooth ﬂow when
being h-reﬁned and p-reﬁned, respectively. The square wave test case is designed to visually
show the eﬀects of HWENO limiting for a discontinuous ﬂow.
A sine wave deﬁned as q0 (x) = 0.5 [sin (2πx) + 1] is simulated for three revolutions using
10, 15, and 20 cells for each scheme. As shown in Figure 1, the entirely local MCV schemes
experience exponential convergence in error, which is expected for a multi-moment scheme.
Also, each scheme achieves its expected order of convergence in h-reﬁnement experiments
A square wave is revolved about the domain three times using 50 cells, and the results
are plotted in Figure 2. Notice that even without limiting, the overshoots are only roughly
15% of the jump magnitude. In all cases, when HWENO limiting is applied, the oscillations
are eliminated, and overshoots are orders of magnitude smaller. Note also that every moment
is represented in the plots, as they are converted to GLL points within the cell to show the

Conclusions

MCV schemes of order three through seven with two to four unique moments per cell have
been developed for use with the ADER-DT time discretization. HWENO limiting was developed
wherein the optimal polynomial relaxes to one of three quadratic polynomials based only on cell
averages when discontinuities arise. Simulations conﬁrmed the correct polynomial h-reﬁnement
convergence as well as the expected exponential p-reﬁnement convergence. Also conﬁrmed is
that the HWENO limiting successfully removes oscillations and reduces overshoots by orders
of magnitude.
This study conﬁrms that the proposed HWENO-limited MCV ADER-DT method is a viable high-order, multi-moment, robust method for transport applications. Most notably, the
maximum stable CFL value remains at one no matter how many moments are introduced or
how high-order the schemes are. While only one set of low-order WENO polynomials is used
here, it is a proof of concept to demonstrate that the limiting strategy is sound and applies
well to other sets of low-ordered WENO polynomials such as is used in [8]. What has not been
established and needs to be investigated in future study is how well the HWENO-limited MCV
ADER-DT methods apply to non-linear systems and to multiple spatial dimensions. Also, the
computational expense of MCV compared to other operators needs to be studied as well.
