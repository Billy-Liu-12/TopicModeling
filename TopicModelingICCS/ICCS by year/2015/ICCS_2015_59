Abstract
Coherent x-ray diﬀractive imaging is a novel imaging technique that utilizes phase retrieval
and nonlinear optimization methods to image matter at nanometer scales. We explore how
the convergence properties of a popular phase retrieval algorithm, Fienup’s HIO, behave by
introducing a reduced dimensionality problem allowing us to visualize and quantify convergence
to local minima and the globally optimal solution. We then introduce generalizations of HIO
that improve upon the original algorithm’s ability to converge to the globally optimal solution.
Keywords: Phase retrieval algorithms; inverse problems; nonlinear complex-valued optimization

Introduction

Coherent x-ray diﬀractive imaging (CXDI) is a microscopy technique that images a sample
without optics [9]. In the experimental geometry shown in Fig. 1, monochromatic coherent
plane wave x-rays interact with a sample to form an exit wave ρ(r) ∈ Cm×n , where r ∈ R =
{(ru , rv ) : u ∈ 0, . . . , n − 1, v ∈ 0, . . . , m − 1} denotes a length scale that is the spatial resolution
of the microscope and mn ∈ Z is the number of complex variables constituting the measured
exit wave. A detector is placed in the far ﬁeld so that a quantity proportional to the squared
modulus of the Fourier transform of the exit wave, F [ρ], is measured. Thus, one obtains the

wise), starts with an initial exit wave guess and iteratively corrects the current exit wave iterate
by using information known about the experiment. This information includes the measured
diﬀraction intensities, D, as well as knowledge about the sample, most notably the support
of the sample, which describes a subregion in the space R in whose complement the sample
is known to not exist. CXDI has proved popular in practice, having been extended to many
diverse samples and experimental regimes, and has been shown to yield a unique exit wave in
special cases [1, 3, 11, 9].
In its simplest form, CXDI can be viewed as a feasibility problem [2],

One of the simplest algorithms for approximately solving (1) is the alternating projection
algorithm known as “error reduction” (ER) in the phase retrieval community [5]:
ρ(k+1) = πS πM ρ(k) ,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

(4)

The ER algorithm repeatedly applies the measurement projection πM and the support projection πS to iterate between the sample space and the diﬀraction space; see Fig. 2a. Since ER
can be viewed as projected steepest descent for the problem minρ { D − |F [ρ] |2 2F : ρ ∈ S},
it can stagnate at stationary points that do not solve (1); see trajectory #1 in Fig. 2b. As
we reaﬃrm in our numerical results, convergence clearly depends on the initial exit wave guess
ρ(0) .
Although several methods have been developed to overcome such stagnation, the current
workhorse of experimentalists remains Fienup’s “hybrid input-output” (HIO) method [5]. HIO
can be viewed as a version of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm for nonconvex problems [2]
through the relaxation parameter β ∈ R:
ρ(k+1) = πS πM ρ(k) + πS c (1 − βπM )ρ(k) ,

k = 0, 1, . . . ,

(5)

where πS c is a binary operator orthogonal to πS , with S c = {ρ ∈ Cm×n : ρ ∈
/ S}∪{0} and where
πS + πS c = 1, with 1 ∈ Rm×n denoting the matrix containing all ones. As we illustrate in our
numerical results, HIO is generally more robust than ER in avoiding stagnation at nonglobal
solutions; but as will be shown more robust algorithms exist.
The contributions of this paper are as follows. We explore generalized formulations of HIO
as a saddle-point optimization problem and present optimization-based strategies for making
HIO more eﬃcient and robust in its ability to escape from nonglobal solutions. We propose a
visualization mechanism for a low-dimensional problem that allows one to gain intuition about
the saddle-point objective and an algorithm’s traversal of this space. We then examine the HIO
variants developed with this mechanism.

HIO and Saddle-Point Optimization

The HIO algorithm in (5) can be viewed as a heuristic for ﬁnding a Nash equilibrium (see, e.g.,
[4]) of the two-person game

minρs ∈S
(6)
¯
maxρs ∈S c L(ρs + ρs ),

where ρs = πS ρ and ρs = πS c ρ = (1 − πS )ρ represent an orthogonal decomposition of Cm×n

and the objective function L : Cm×n → R is given by
L(ρ) = ε2M (ρ) − ε2S (ρ) = πM ρ − ρ

(7)

In this game, one player seeks to minimize the objective by controlling ρ inside the support, while
the second player seeks to maximize the objective by controlling ρ outside the support. Nash
equilibiria for (6) correspond to particular saddle points of the function f (ρs , ρs ) = L(ρs + ρs ).
¯

This fact motivates algorithmic approaches that solve related saddle-point problems [7].

be decomposed into parts inside and outside the support, respectively:

δs = πS ∇ρ¯L(ρ) = (πS − πS πM )ρ

and

containing all zeros.
Taking a step along the steepest descent direction inside the support and a step along the
steepest ascent direction outside the support would thus correspond to the combined direction
(−δs , δs ). If we allow for unequal steplengths (α, β) along these respective orthogonal directions,
¯
we obtain the ﬁrst-order update
ρ(k+1) = ρ(k) − αδs(k) + βδs(k) = (1 − α)ρ(k) + α(πS πM )ρ(k) + πS c (α1 − βπM ) ρ(k) ,
¯

(9)

where we have used the fact that πS + πS c = 1. The special case where α = 1 then corresponds
to the HIO algorithm of (5).
A generalization of the HIO algorithm can be obtained by looking beyond the α = 1 case
and considering more general values for β, rather than using a ﬁxed value taken from the
typical range of β ∈ [0.5, 1] as is enforced by practical HIO implementations [5, 7]. One way of
obtaining (α, β) values in each iteration of the form (9) is to solve the two-dimensional version
(k)
(k)
of (6) with the common objective ψk (α, β) = L(ρ(k) − αδs + βδs ).

where Φk (α, β) = ∇ψk (α, β) 2 = |∂α ψk (α, β)|2 + |∂β ψk (α, β)|2 . The form of the second-order
matrix in (10) is chosen to obtain the proper inertia for a minimization with respect to α and
a maximization with respect to β. The step length μ along the Newton-like direction in (10)
can be determined by a line search (e.g., using the strong Wolfe conditions) for the objective
Φk (α, β); a similar approach is taken in [7]. An example of this process in shown in Fig. 3.

Quasi-Newton and Conjugate Gradient Update Directions

The bidirectional approach described above includes HIO as a special case, but one can also
consider more general approaches to solving (6). We now propose two such approaches –
based on L-BFGS and conjugate gradient (CG) direction steps, respectively – that use general
directions dk in the update

The dimensionality of phase retrieval problems in typical experimental settings is on the
order of mn = 106 complex-valued variables. Therefore, computing an approximation of the
dense Hessian (with 1012 complex-valued variables) for use in quasi-Newton methods is prohibitively expensive in terms of storage. Instead, we look to limited-memory methods such as
L-BFGS [8]. Our L-BFGS method follows the developments of [10] and is given in Algorithm 1.
We note, for ease of exposition, that this algorithm works on the vectorized version, ρ ∈ Cmn ,
and thus each of the quantities sk−1 , yk−1 , and gk are column vectors. Algorithm 1 can be
used both inside (A = S) and outside (A = S c ) the support, with appropriate projection (πS
or πS c ) providing the required input. In our implementation, we keep the past p = 5 updates.
Algorithm 1 returns an approximate Newton step with the inertia of the quasi-Newton
Hessian Bk determining whether one seeks a minimum or a maximum. We achieve the correct
direction by an appropriate scaling of the initial quasi-Newton matrix (the identity matrix is
used in our experiments). If the term

We now examine the eﬀectiveness of the methods described in Sec. 2 in terms of their robustness
for solving the low-dimensional problem whose exit wave ρ ∈ R16×16 and diﬀraction pattern
are shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, respectively. The exit wave is real-valued and consists

of three pixels, ρ(ra ) = 0.05, ρ(rb ) = 0.8, and ρ(rc ) = 0.125, arranged in an upside-down-L
shape. The remaining pixels are zero, and the correct support S = {ra , rb , rc } is assumed given.

For visualization purposes, we treat ρ(rc ) as known; this leaves us with a 255-complex-variabledimensional problem, with the only two nonzeros being ρ(ra ) and ρ(rb ), a setting inspired by a
similar synthetic problem in [7].
This problem allows us to visualize the solution in the two-dimensional subspace (ρ(ra ), ρ(rb ),
ρ(rc ) = 0.125, ρs = 0) where L(ρ) reduces to the the modulus objective function ε2M (ρ) =
¯
2
πM ρ − ρ F as a function of ρ(ra ) and ρ(rb ); see Fig. 4c. The minimum labeled mG is the
global minimum of this metric and corresponds to the input exit wave (with ρ(ra ) = 0.05 and
ρ(rb ) = 0.8). The nonglobal minimum labeled m1 arises because phase retrieval is in general
insensitive to global phase shifts in the exit wave (i.e., |F [ρ] | = |F ρeiφ0 | for a constant
phase shift φ0 ∈ R). For the m1 minimum, we have a phase shift of φ0 = π, which corresponds
to the negative of the input exit wave (ρ(ra ) = −0.05 and ρ(rb ) = −0.8). However, such
global phase shifts are not equivalent in our problem, since the value of ρ(rc ) is known. The
nonglobal minima labeled m2 and m3 arise because of Fourier transform symmetries, whereby
|F [ρ] | = |F [χ] | when χ is ρ¯ rotated by 180◦ . The minimum labeled m2 corresponds to the
ρ
exit wave ρ¯ rotated by 180◦ , while the minimum labeled m3 corresponds to the exit wave −¯
rotated by 180◦ . Similar to m1 , the m2 and m3 minima are not global minima because of the
Fourier transform symmetry-breaking eﬀects of our knowledge of the value of ρ(rc ).
Using this problem setup, we now propose a means of visualizing the exit wave recovered
as a function of a methods starting values (ρ(0) (ra ), ρ(0) (rb )). For a given method, we consider
441 starting points (ρ(0) (ra ), ρ(0) (rb )) taken in steps of 0.15 from the box [−1.5, 1.5]2 . We
then examine which of the ε2M minima (mG , m1 , m2 , or m3 ) in the two-dimensional space
(ρ(ra ), ρ(rb )) the method converges to from the selected starting point. An example of this
visualization is provided in Fig. 4d for the ER method from (4). Since the ER method is
projected steepest descent, we expect to arrive at the minima closest to the starting point.
This result is indeed seen in Fig. 4d, with the obtained minimum indicated by a color coding
of the starting point.
We repeat these 441 runs using an implementation of each of the presented methods, with
care taken to ensure consistent experimental conditions. We start with a ρ(0) of zeros, except for
the prescribed (ρ(0) (ra ), ρ(0) (rb )) values and the ﬁxed ρ(0) (rc ) value. Each of the new variants
(0)
(0)
(0)
(0)
uses initial search directions ds = −δs and ds = δs and in the ﬁrst iteration determines
¯
¯
optimal (α0 , β0 ) using the method discussed in Sec. 2.1 to update ρ(1) as in (11). For subsequent
iterations, we compute ∇ρ¯L(ρ(k) ) and use the L-BFGS or CG update to compute the new search
directions d(k) . Once this update is done, we determine optimal (αk , βk ) and update ρ(k+1) .
After computing d(k) each iteration, we check the sign on the directional derivatives in S and
S c by computing Re[ r [δ¯(k) d(k) ](r)]; if when updating in S we have a positive directional
derivative (are going uphill when we should be going down) or if updating in S c we have
a negative directional derivative (are going downhill when we should be going up), we reset
the oﬀending update to be the standard HIO update in (8), i.e. steepest descent in S and
steepest ascent in S c . When determining optimal (αk , βk ), we allow only ﬁve iterations for the
saddle-point optimization process in (10).
Our visualization in Fig. 4e shows that the HIO method from (9) with optimal (α, β) and
search directions inside and outside the support given in (8) can avoid the local minima m2 and
m3 , but the results also show that this HIO variant is susceptible to stagnation in the nonglobal
minimum m1 . HIO with optimal (α, β) can ﬁnd the global minimum mG about 75% of the
time out of all 441 starting points explored. In Fig. 4f-i, we show results for some representative
combinations of using CG and L-BFGS inside and outside the support together with optimal
(α, β). For example, in Fig. 4f we use CG search directions with the DY update (see Table 1)
inside the support while using the FR update outside the support; clearly some combinations

of CG updates inside and outside of the support have signiﬁcant adverse eﬀects. In Fig. 4g we
use the LS update inside the support and the DY update outside the support; while the use of
these CG update parameters still has signiﬁcant adverse eﬀects, they are less severe than that
in Fig. 4f. In Fig. 4h, we use the HZ update inside the support and the PR update outside the
support, while in Fig. 4i we use the L-BFGS direction update from (1) inside the support and
the HS update from Table 1 outside the support; these are representatives of CG and L-BFGS
update combinations that signiﬁcantly improve the algorithm’s beneﬁcial ability to converge to
the global solution.
In Fig. 5 we summarize the results for the 81 variants obtained by coupling diﬀerent approaches for the updates inside and outside the support. The plots show the fraction of the
441 starting points in the interval where the global minimum mG is obtained. From these
results we can determine whether mixing L-BFGS and CG direction updates in S and S c is an
eﬀective way of obtaining more robust performance. The CG methods of PR, LS, and DY in
Figs. 5c, e, and f, respectively, appear to have similar to slightly worse behavior when compared
with the normal HIO update in Fig. 5a. The CG method of FR in Fig. 5b appears to have
only harmful eﬀects on convergence to mG when used in S and generally harmful eﬀects when
used in S c . The CG method of CD in Fig. 5g generally has harmful eﬀects when used in S and
823

indiﬀerent eﬀects when used in S c . The CG methods of HZ and HS in Fig. 5d and Fig. 5h,
respectively, and the L-BFGS method in Fig. 5i all have beneﬁcial eﬀects, with L-BFGS being
the most eﬀective. In some cases these variants converge to the global minimum from almost
all the 441 starting points.

Outlook

We have explored how a popular phase retrieval algorithm, Fienup’s HIO, behaves when updates
to an exit wave inside and outside the support are generalized by using nonlinear conjugate
gradient and limited-memory quasi-Newton updates along with an optimal weighting of these
updates. We have examined the robustness of these methods by studying a low-dimensional,
synthetic problem in order to visualize how these generalized updates can improve or harm
convergence to an optimal solution. Our study has shown that certain combinations of CG and
L-BFGS updates dramatically improve the ability of an algorithm to recover the prescribed exit
wave. We also have shown that some combinations should be avoided because of limitations of
their robustness.
A standard procedure of experimentalists using HIO is to use many diﬀerent starting guesses
for the exit wave, to run many diﬀerent independent trials, and then to compare the exit waves
recovered from these runs. Solutions obtained in this way are invariably diﬀerent, and what
are considered “good” solutions is sometimes left to more subjective, qualitative criteria. We
anticipate that application of the generalized updates presented here will increase the conﬁdence
of experimentalists to reduce the number of starting points considered.
