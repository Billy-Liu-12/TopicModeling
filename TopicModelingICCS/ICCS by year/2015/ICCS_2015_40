Abstract
This talk will provide an overview of future directions in Big Data and Big Computing, as driven by the
DDDAS paradigm. In DDDAS, the computation and instrumentation aspects of an application system are
integrated in a dynamic feed-back control loop. Thus, by its inception DDDAS is a driver for application
support environments where the computational platforms span the diverse range of high-end and mid-range
computing and including the instrumentation platforms, stationary and mobile networked sensors, and enduser devices. Commensurately, the data involved in DDDAS environments span data associated with
complex computer models of application systems to instrumentation-data – either collected from large
instruments or from the multitudes of heterogeneous mobile and stationary ubiquitous sensing devices, and
including end-user devices. Data from ubiquitous sensing constitute the next wave of Big Data. These
collections of ubiquitous and heterogeneous sensing devices not only are sources of large volumes of
heterogeneous sets of data, but also the amount of computing that is performed collectively on the multitudes
of instrumentation/sensor platforms amounts to significant computational power which should be viewed in
tandem with that performed in the high-end platforms. In DDDAS environments, this range of platforms from the high-end, to the instrumentation and end-user platforms - constitute the dynamically integrated,
unified platform referred to here as Large-Scale-Big-Computing (LSBC); the diverse sets of data - from
high-end computing data to data from large sets of heterogeneous sensing are referred to as Large-Scale-BigData (LSBD). There are challenges and opportunities in supporting and exploiting Large-Scale-BigComputing and Large-Scale-Big-Data. DDDAS has been applied and is creating new capabilities in many
application areas spanning systems from the nanoscale to the terra-scale and the extraterra-scale, and
covering a multitude of domains such as: physical, chemical, biological systems (e.g.: engineered
materials, protein folding, bionetworks); engineered systems (e.g.: structural health monitoring,
decision support and environment cognizant operation); surveillance, co-operative sensing, autonomic
coordination, cognition; energy efficient operations; medical and health systems (e.g.: MRI imaging,
seizure control); ecological and environmental systems (e.g.: earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados,
wildfires, volcanic eruptions and ash transport, chemical pollution); fault tolerant critical infrastructure
systems (e.g.: electric-powergrids, transportation systems); manufacturing processes planning and
control; space weather and adverse atmospheric events; cybersecurity; systems software. DDDAS is a
driver for LSBC and LSBD environments and but also a methodology to efficiently manage and exploit
these large-scale-heterogeneous resources, aspects which will be addressed in the talk; additional examples
of DDDAS-based new capabilities for such applications are provided in other papers in this workshop.
