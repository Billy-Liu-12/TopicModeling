Abstract
The Boundary Averaged Multi-moment Constrained ﬁnite-Volume (BA-MCV) method is derived, explained, and evaluated for 1-D transport to assess accuracy, maximum stable time
step (MSTS), oscillations for discontinuous data, and parallel communication burden. The
BA-MCV scheme is altered from the original MCV scheme to compute the updates of point
wise cell boundary derivatives entirely locally. Then it is altered such that boundary moments
are replaced with the interface upwind value. The scheme is stable at a maximum stable CFL
(MSCFL) value of one no matter how high-order the scheme is, giving signiﬁcantly larger time
steps than Galerkin methods, for which the MSCFL decreases nearly quadratically with increasing order. The BA-MCV method is compared against a SE method at varying order, both
using the ADER-DT time discretization. BA-MCV error for a sine wave was comparable to
the same order of accuracy for a SE method. The resulting large time step, multi-moment, low
communication scheme is of great interest for exascale architectures.

Introduction

For exascale applications, improvement in computing infrastructure alone is not going to cut it.
If anything, given the increase in the hierarchical nature of emerging computing and especially
the rising cost of data movement, the need for new numerical integration algorithms is now
paramount. Yet, the constraints on new algorithms are often conﬂicting. Making a choice to
address one constraint often poorly aﬀects another. Developing a method that balances these
constraints in a new way can be elusive.
For reasons of data reuse and compute intensity, higher-order methods are likely better
suited for current and emerging platforms. However, for unresolved ﬂows with discontinuities
and / or shocks, these methods must be able to be limited in a way that gives sharp resolution of
discontinuities as well as high-order convergence for smoother sections of ﬂow. Often, however,

limiting comes at high cost in terms of accuracy and parallel communication. Neighboring information is always necessary, and accuracy is reduced for the sake of robustness. Furthermore,
multi-moment high-order methods are of interest for future architectures because reconstruction
of intra-cell variation can be performed without any parallel communication. They also experience exponential increase in accuracy with increasing order more quickly than single-moment
methods because the DOFs are closer to the region of sampling. However, they tend to come
at the cost of drastically reduced time steps and more cumbersome limiting techniques.

Multi-moment schemes have come in increasing varieties in recent decades. Traditionally,
there was the Finite-Element method, but it suﬀers the problem of global support in the basis
functions, requiring a global linear solve. Galerkin methods bring signiﬁcantly greater locality
to the multi-moment realm by decoupling the basis functions such that they have local support
only [1, 3, 6]. Many Galerkin schemes also exhibit a minimal parallel data transfer property
in that, when properly constructed, only the boundary moments must be communicated to
perform an update. All Eulerian, time-explicit, Galerkin schemes suﬀer a nearly quadratic
reduction in the MSTS with increasing element order.

There are also Spectral Volume (SV) [12] schemes, which often deliver larger MSTSs than
comparable-order Galerkin methods. Still, the MSTS decreases somewhere between quadratically and linearly for each of these methods. There are Constrained Interpolation Proﬁle (CIP)
[13] and Multi-moment Constrained ﬁnite-Volume (MCV) [5] schemes as well, many of which
show positive time step properties that are larger than comparable-order Galerkin schemes,
but the MSTS still decreases with increasing order for Eulerian formulations. There do exist
semi-Lagrangian and characteristics-based MCV schemes, which do not suﬀer the same time
step degradation [4], but they can only be applied to non-linear multi-dimensional systems via
dimensional splitting, and a more widely applicable technique is desired. The Multi-Moment
Finite-Volume (MMFV) [9, 8] method has the fortunate property that the MSTS remains at the
linear CFL criterion of 1/D, where D is the spatial dimensionality, no matter how high-order
it is. However, it also oscillates wildly for even remotely non-smooth ﬂows, likely due to how
loosely coupled the DOFs are as they’re evolved.

The goal of this study is to introduce a new multi-moment method, the Boundary-Averaged
Multi-moment Constrained ﬁnite-Volume (BA-MCV), which has a Maximum Stable CFL
(MSCFL) value of one in 1-D no matter how high-order, has low parallel data transfer requirements, and is robust without explicit limiting even for discontinuous data in the linear
case. It is easily tensored into multiple dimensions for non-linear systems due to its strictly
Eulerian formulation. Rather than simply deﬁning the method, the goal is to demonstrate how
various design choices aﬀected the overall scheme. The focus is on the spatial operator, and
therefore the temporal operator for all methods implemented and tested will be the ADER-DT
time discretization, which is a scalable single-stage, single-step arbitrarily high-order time integrator that cheaply forms space-time polynomials of all PDE terms, removing the need for
quadrature [8, 11, 9]. Also, with ADER-DT, the temporal order of accuracy always matches
the spatial. The 1-D transport equation will be the testbed as well, to allow for a more in depth
view of the schemes. While the BA-MCV scheme can be limited, at least with WENO [10, 7],
limiting is also outside the scope of this study.

Numerical Methods

2.1

Reference SE Scheme

For reference, an SE scheme is implemented up to tenth-order accuracy. A test function is
ﬁrst applied to the PDE. Then, it is then integrated over the global domain, and the periodic boundary conditions rid the need to apply the boundary Dirichlet ﬂux terms. Then, the
variational constraint is kept globally by applying it to a series of individual elements. Next,
the test function is assumed to belong to a series of unit Lagrange interpolating polynomials
set on a Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto (GLL) grid within each element. The solution is assumed to
belong to the same space as the test function, and the mass and stiﬀness matrices are approximated using GLL quadrature on the same GLL grid. This leads to an inexact and diagonal
mass matrix. Finally, boundary values are replaced with the average from adjacent elements
after the fact to facilitate communication between elements. While this violates conservation,
it does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect accuracy, and it increases the MSTS by 30-50% when coupled
with the ADER-DT time integrator. Also, one could implement a mimetic averaging operator
that maintains continuity, but this doesn’t signiﬁcantly aﬀect accuracy, so it is not considered
herein. The MSCFL values for the ADER-DT SE scheme are listed in Table 1. The MSCFL
values for BA-MCV and SE in Table 1 are computed through a harmonic stability analysis.

2.2

Variations of the MCV Scheme

Consider a PDE system in 1-D: ∂q/∂t + ∂f /∂x = 0, subject to the initial condition q (x, 0) =
q0 (x), on a periodic domain. A uniform, Cartesian grid is composed of non-overlapping cells,
Ωi ∈ xi−1/2 , xi+1/2 , where xi±1/2 = xi ± Δx/2. The discrete degrees of freedom are cellintegrated averages and a series of point values and derivatives located at cell interfaces. They
are deﬁned as:

2.2.1

Original MCV Scheme

The original MCV scheme does not directly evolve the DOFs deﬁned in (1). Rather, it evolves
∗
a set of nodal point values deﬁned on a regularly spaced grid, qi,ξ
, where ξ ∈ {1, . . . , N } and
N is the order of accuracy of the scheme. Here, GLL point values are used, but this has no
substantive diﬀerence in the solution, since it is determined by the constraints, not the nodal
point locations. The local variation is reconstructed by interpolating Lagrange polynomials
∗
from qi,ξ
. The DOFs themselves would typically be evolved as follows:

where Fi−1/2,n is the the upwind, time-averaged, mth-order derivative of the ﬂux that is computed from a local space-time polynomial of the ﬂux, fi,n (x, t), which itself is computed using
Diﬀerential Transforms (DTs), see [9, 2, 8]. A third-order-accurate MCV scheme, for instance,

strain q i,n , qi,n , qi,n , qi,n , and qi,n . Higher-order schemes are constructed likewise, by
constraining higher- and higher-order pointwise derivatives of q at the boundary. The schemes
will be denoted as MCV-M -N , where M is the number of unique DOFs and N is the order
of accuracy. Note that the cell average is evolved in weak form and the pointwise derivatives,
(m)±
qi,n , are evolved in strong form via spatial derivatives of the PDE. This is why all MCV
schemes are exactly mass conserving. Since a set of nodal values are being evolved instead of
(m+1)
these DOFs, however, the tendencies, − (Δt/Δx) Fi+1/2,n − Fi−1/2,n and −ΔtFi±1/2,n , are
computed and then cast into tendencies for the nodal points via a matrix-vector multiply. See
[5] for more details. The nodal points are then updated directly via the transformed tendencies.
Because of the FV constraint, the method is locally mass conserving, and the nodal points are
convenient for applying physics and other treatments since it is just a set of nodal point values.
One of the downsides to this formulation of the scheme is that it is highly oscillatory for
discontinuous data when implemented at higher-than-ﬁfth-order accuracy, as shown in Figure
1a. The ﬁfth-order-accurate scheme is well-bounded, but the seventh-order-accurate scheme is
far too oscillatory. So some measures must be taken to introduce more implicit diﬀusion if the
scheme is going to be useful at higher orders of accuracy.
2.2.2

Directly Evolving the DOFs

In order to take these measures, the scheme ﬁrst must be cast such that it directly evolves
the same DOFs that it constrains. Therefore, the scheme is altered such that the evolution
equations (2) are used directly. This gives results that diﬀer from nodal points by a relative
order of 10−12 in the L1 error norm, showing the equivalence of directly evolving DOFs versus
evolving nodal values, as well as the equivalence of where these point values are placed.
2.2.3

Averaging Boundary Pointwise Moments

To facilitate a tighter coupling between cells, the boundary pointwise derivatives were averaged
together to ensure they are shared between cells at each time step. A straightforward linear
average is used. The reduction in oscillations is substantial when using this technique, and
it is shown in Figure 1b. Most notably, the oscillations do not propagate as far from the
discontinuity. However, they are still fairly large for this order of accuracy.
In truth, all that is necessary for boundary DOFs to be shared between adjacent cells is that
they merely be equal at the beginning. This is because they share a common ﬂux. However,
if one wished to locally limit the DOFs using something such as WENO, for instance, then
boundary DOFs are no longer guaranteed to be equal, and they must be averaged after every
step.
2.2.4

Using Upwind Averaging

Therefore, given how upwinding usually introduces a measure of implicit diﬀusion into the
solution, instead of using straightforward average, an upwind value is used at each interface. In
non-linear systems, this would correspond to the locally frozen Godunov state. This decreases

1c.

2.2.5

Entirely Local Pointwise Updates

The downside to using averaging in the ﬁrst place is that it introduces extra parallel communication. When averaging, one must communication 2M − 1 diﬀerent values per cell interface,
where M is the number of unique moments, and the order of accuracy is N = 2M − 1. This
is because M values must be communicated for interface ﬂuxes to the constraints, and M − 1
extra values must be communicated for the averaging of the boundary pointwise derivatives.
If the updates for the pointwise derivatives are computed entirely locally, however, instead of
using upwind ﬂuxes, the scheme’s parallel communication is reduced by almost 2x and becomes
simply M values per time step per interface. Also, this does not appreciably aﬀect the solution,
as it only changes by a relative order of 10−13 in experiments. Therefore, in the ﬁnal scheme,
the pointwise interface derivatives are updated using only the local polynomial.

Results and Discussion

For evaluating the BA-MCV schemes, the linear transport equation, ∂t q + ∂x q = 0, will be
used. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, each simulation will advect a square wave three times about
the domain of [0, 1]. The BA-MCV schemes will use a CFL value of 0.9 is all simulations. The
SE schemes will use CFL values at 90% of the values reported in Table 1.

3.1

Accuracy

A single-period sine wave is advected across the periodic domain three times. The BA-MCV
method exhibits exponential error decrease with increasing order, as would be expected of
any multi-moment method. In fact, it increases at a rate substantially faster than SE when
comparing the number of unique DOFs per cell (see Figure 2a). However, when comparing
error to the order of accuracy, then BA-MCV errors and SE errors behave similarly, and the
BA-MCV errors are somewhat less accurate. Though it depends heavily on the smoothness of
the data at hand, one can establish a rough equivalence between the two schemes in terms of
error and order of accuracy for this test at least. This is given in Table 2.

3.2

Oscillations / Robustness

In Figure 3, a plot of the square wave advected three times about the periodic domain is
given for each of the BA-MCV and SE schemes in order to show the magnitude of oscillations
that develop from each of the schemes. The BA-MCV schemes are very well behaved up to
ninth-order accuracy. At eleventh-order accuracy, the oscillations become somewhat larger,
up to about 50% of the jump magnitude. At thirteenth- and ﬁfteenth-order accuracy, the
oscillations become signiﬁcantly larger. The SE method’s oscillations do not become much
larger with increasing order. Note that when the square wave is slightly relaxed as in Figure
4, the oscillations quickly reduce for the eleventh- through ﬁfteenth-order-accurate functions.
So any limiting method used to reduce oscillations for these methods should maintain the high
resolution of steep data proﬁles.

3.3

Parallel Considerations

An N th-order-accurate BA-MCV scheme must transfer (N + 1) /2 values per cell interface per
time step across a domain decomposition boundary. While this is not the optimal case of only
having to communicate the boundary values per time step as is the case with the SE method, it
is still low, and it is only nearest neighbor communication. Given the time step, the BA-MCV
scheme has substantially less communication per length of simulation time than the SE method.
There is also potential for communication overlap, even within a single cell. The updates for
the boundary DOFs are entirely local, and they do not depend on one another. Therefore, the
transfer of one boundary DOF can be performed as soon as it is updated, and that transfer can
be overlapped with the local update of the next boundary DOF in a staged manner.

Conclusions

The BA-MCV scheme has been developed and explained in regard to how it diﬀers from existing
MCV methods and why certain design choices were made in the algorithm. In all, it has been
shown to be exponentially convergent and roughly as accurate as the SE method, given the same
order of accuracy. However, the BA-MCV time step remains at a MSCFL value of one no matter
how high-order the scheme is and no matter how many unique DOFs per cell are evolved. The
BA-MCV scheme remains well bounded up to eleventh-order accuracy as well, and past that,
hyperdiﬀusive and other limiters must be applied to control oscillations when discontinuous
data is present. This scheme is particularly useful because of the time step remaining constant
with p-reﬁnement. For instance, one can construct an eleventh-order-accurate BA-MCV scheme
that is almost as accurate as a tenth-order-accurate SE method but with almost a 30x larger
time step, resulting in a signiﬁcantly cheaper method with comparable accuracy. This gives
much greater motivation to pursuing p-reﬁnement for throughput and eﬃciency purposes as
well as parallel scalability arguments through compute intensity and threading potential on
accelerated devices.
In future work, the ﬁrst task is to implement the BA-MCV method in two spatial dimensions
and see if it maintains these positive time step properties compared to the one-dimensional
versions presented herein. Further, HWENO limiters will be applied to demonstrate that,
when altering local DOFs using HWENO approximations, the overall scheme greatly reduces
spurious oscillations in the presence of discontinuous data for linear and non-linear ﬂow. Finally,
the method will be applied to non-linear systems of conservation laws to test accuracy and
robustness in a more challenging context.
