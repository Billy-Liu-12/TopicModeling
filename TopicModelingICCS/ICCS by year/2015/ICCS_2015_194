Abstract
Climate change as a result of human activities is a problem of a paramount importance. The global
temperature on Earth is gradually increasing and it may lead to substantially hotter summers in a
moderate belt of Europe, which in turn is likely to influence the air conditioning penetration in this
region. The current work is an attempt to predict air conditioning penetration in different residential
areas in the UK between 2030-2090 using an integration of calibrated building models, future weather
predictions and an agent-based model. Simulation results suggest that up to 12% of homes would
install an air conditioner in 75 years’ time assuming an average purchasing ability of the households.
The performed simulations provide more insight into the influence of overheating intensity along with
households’ purchasing ability and social norms upon households’ decisions to purchase an air
conditioner.

1 Introduction
Climate change causes increases in the annual average surface temperature of the Earth. It is
estimated that by 2050 the annual temperature will increase by 4 degrees Celsius (Auffhammer &
Aroonruengsawat, 2011). Countries where air conditioning in buildings is not considered the norm are
likely to experience increasing numbers of heatwaves during this time. This may influence residents
within those countries to purchase Air Conditioning machines (A/C). This is especially plausible in
relatively wealthy European countries, for instance France, Germany and UK and in the countries with
growing economies in Asia such as China and India.

According to some forecasting models, (e.g. Isaac & Van Vuuren, 2009), the energy demand for
cooling buildings will be much greater than that for heating by 2090. This implies that the future
penetration of A/Cs will have a greater impact on climate change than heating because the carbon
emissions for electricity are currently higher than the emissions for fuel use for heating. As annual
temperatures rise as a result of these emissions, the demand for air conditioning will increase
exponentially creating a vicious cycle of rising temperatures. To mitigate these events, the systematic
study of air conditioning penetration processes in potential areas is vital. So far this issue has received
little attention in Europe and there is no available statistics on the usage of A/Cs at a national level in
Northern Europe. Several studies have attempted to quantify and predict air conditioning penetration.
Sailor and Pavlova (2003) quantified the relationship between cooling degree days and the penetration
level of air conditioners across 39 US cities. Using a similar approach, McNeil and Letschert (2008)
modelled the adoption of air conditioning across different regions including Western Europe. They
estimated a logistic relationship between penetration rates across countries, income and forecasted air
conditioning penetration up to year 2030. Both these studies considered climate and income as
influencing factors only, and did not account for dynamic climate change. Auffhammer (2014)
extended the model proposed by McNeil and Letschert (2008) using the A/C utilisation data in China
and included weather variability as a factor for air conditioning penetration. His findings suggest that
“global warming may […] not only lead to higher saturation levels of air conditioners, but also their
speedier adoption” (Auffhammer, 2014).
These studies take a population-based econometric approach to modelling air conditioning
penetration forecasting and energy demand, by modelling macroeconomic variables and climate
variables. This approach provides little insight into the behaviour of individual residents and fails to
address the role of social influence. In contrast, we propose an agent-based computational model of air
conditioning penetration in three residential areas in the UK. By using agent-based modelling
(Jennings, 2000), we strive to simulate the behaviours of individual households and their interactions
with the environment and buildings to provide insight into more global behaviour at a population
level. This approach is crucial for designing energy reduction interventions and policies aimed at
individual households.
Our methodology integrates future weather files, building models and an agent-based purchasing
decision-making model. To our knowledge, there has been no research on air conditioning purchasing
prediction that considers the building characteristics and resulting indoor overheating intensity. We
adopt a psychological model, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991), to model agents as it
accounts for the role of social influence (and other cognitive influences of deliberative behaviour).
Although the methodology is applicable to other countries, the study was limited to the UK due to the
availability of resources.

2 Modelling Methodology
Most models for air conditioning penetration described in the literature are population-based
models developed in the econometric tradition. Although these models might make quite good
predictions at a global level, due to the great level of abstraction, they lack the transparency of micromodels that model the world as consisting of interactive microelements. Agent-oriented approaches
have been widely used for modelling complex socio-technical systems from the micro-level
perspective (Jennings, 2000). The essence of agent-based modelling is the agent-oriented world view
that implies that the world consists of active, purposeful agents that interact to achieve their objectives.
This is particularly relevant for modelling human cognition and behaviour in the context of buildingoccupant bi-directional interactions. Agent-based modelling can provide more insight into the
emergent behaviour of the whole system given the behaviour of its small parts. It is especially
important for the application of future policies and interventions aimed at solving the problem at hand.

In order to model realistic human agents, an appropriate framework for agents architecture is
needed that is based on validated psychological theories of human behaviour. There are different
psychological frameworks that can be adopted for modelling agent’s behaviour at a micro-level in the
given context of conscious behaviour. For instance, the Diffusion of Innovations Theory has been
applied to the simulation of the spread of technological innovations in a society based on the
characteristics of individuals (Rogers, 1993). Another model that has been successfully applied within
a range of different domains (from health to economical behaviour; Upton & Nuttall, 2014) is the
Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1991). This theory has been validated extensively and is
highly predictive of deliberative behaviour (see Hardeman et al., 2002; Armitage & Conner, 2001).
The TPB was chosen for these reasons and because it accounts for the ability of individuals to adopt
an innovation (albeit, their perceptions of their ability), an important factor not considered by the
Diffusion of Innovations Theory. The TPB views behaviour as the product of the following sociocognitive factors; behavioural attitude (how the individual feels about the behaviour in question),
subjective norms (perceptions of how others judge the behaviour), perceived behavioural control
(perceptions of their ability to perform the behaviour) and intentions to carry out the behaviour.
During the modelling process, the TPB was formalised and incorporated into the household agents.
This multi-agent model was then integrated with building and future weather models. The schematic
representation of the methodology is given in Figure 1, and will be explained in further sections.

2.1 Building Thermal Models and Overheating Intensity
The set of buildings used for this study was generated using statistics from the housing stock of the
UK (Carbon Trust, 2008). The Building stock was simulated under future weather conditions by using
the future weather files created by the Prometheus project (Eames et al., 2011). The simulations were
performed using the software EnergyPlus (Crawley at al., 1999). Due to the large number of
simulations needed, the complexity of the thermal models were minimised by assuming that the
temperature of all rooms within each was the same. Although this assumption may be unrealistic in
some cases, it reduces the computational time greatly and it has been used previously when many
simulations are required (For example, Robinson et al., 2009; Ramallo-González & Coley, 2013).

In order to demonstrate that the thermal models produce realistic internal temperatures, we first ran
the simulation with real monitored weather data (from the ENLITEN1 project). This data consisted of
internal and external temperatures for 60 dwellings in Exeter, UK, from May to June 2014. After
adjusting the infiltration on the thermal models and comparing internal temperatures from real houses
with the thermal models, we concluded that these were not statistically different.
As previously mentioned, the future weather files used in this work were generated using results
from the Prometheus project (Eames et al., 2011).The weather files come in five different versions per
location and period (20 years) referred to as percentiles. The percentiles correspond to the level of the
average temperature for the year. Having five percentiles allows us to have a view of the potential
weather that may occur in each period (20 years). To maintain the variability of the weather, for each
year we selected randomly one of the five percentiles. To relate the weather and building
characteristics to the agent-based model, we calculated internal overheating and provided it as an input
for agents’ attitudes.
Several indicators used to quantify overheating in houses can be found in the literature (see Nicol
et al., 2009, for a comprehensive review). Our indicator uses the deviation from the comfort
temperature defined by Nicol and Humphereys (2007). This comfort temperature is dependent on the
running average temperature and therefore takes into account adaptation. To quantify the intensity of
the overheating possibility with a single scalar we have integrated the temperature differences over
summer between the internal temperature and the comfort temperature. We have called this indicator
Overheating Intensity (OI).

2.2 Cognitive Agent Model
The model for each household agent is comprised of several interacting components adopted from
the theory of planned behaviour. Those components and their formalization are explained below:
Attitude toward a behaviour (behavioural attitude) is the degree to which performance of the
behaviour is positively or negatively valued (Ajzen, 1991). Here, attitude is determined by the
overheating intensity of the building as it is experienced by an occupant, so that we assume higher OI
levels correspond with higher positive attitudes towards buying an A/C. We assumed the relationship
between OI and attitude to purchasing an A/C is non-linear.
Therefore, in our model attitude Ai of agent i that represent one household is determined by the
following formula:
Ai = th(σ, τ, OI) ,
Eq. 1
where th(σ, τ, OI) is a threshold function of the following form:
th(σ, τ, OI) =





Eq. 2

OI is measured in kKh of a building per year as it is experienced by a household and σ and τ are
the parameters which define the steepness and the threshold of the logistic threshold function applied
to the OI value. Thus, attitude towards purchasing an air conditioner becomes a function of OI. As
mentioned before these parameters were selected in a rather arbitrary way as we wanted to proof this
methodology and its sensitivity to different parameters. As a result, the values for these parameters
were: σ = 0.1, andτ = 0.1 for the medium overheating tolerance scenario and σ = 0.2, and τ = 0.1 for
the low overheating tolerance scenario. These parameters generate the curve shown in Figure 2. We
have called this relationship OI tolerance in the following for the sake of simplicity.

Subjective norm is the perceived social pressure to engage or not to engage in a behaviour.
Subjective norm is determined by the total set of accessible normative beliefs concerning the
expectations of important referents. The subjective norm for each agent is dynamic; the model
assumes that the value of a subjective norm each year depends on the value of the norm at a previous
year which is compared to a general social norm:
Eq. 3
Ni(t +Δt) = Ni(t) +  ⋅ (N*i(t) - Ni(t)) ⋅ Δt
Here α is an update speed parameter, determining how much the agent’s norm at time point t
contributes to its new norm at time t+Δt, we have considered slow social norm dynamic due to the
nature of the problem at hand and therefore gave it a value of 0.01; N*i(t) is a social impact upon agent
i, it is a weighted sum of all agents’ subjective norms. Social impact is calculated using the following
formula:
N*i

where n is the total number of agents in the neighbourhood, xij is the connection of agent i with
agent j and Nj is the value of social norm for agent j.
Perceived behavioural control (PBC) refers to people's perceptions of their ability to perform a
given behaviour. In the current study, we focus on financial capability as a defining quality of PBC.
Intention is an indication of a person's readiness to perform a given behaviour, and it is considered
to be the immediate antecedent of behaviour. Intention of agent i has been calculated as the weighted
sum of its attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. It is expressed with the
following formula:
Eq. 5
Ii = ωatti,inti ⋅ Ai + ωni,inti ⋅ Ni + ωconti,inti ⋅ Ci
where ωatti,inti , ωni,inti and ωconti,inti are the contributions of attitude, subjective norm and perceived
behavioural control to the value of intention respectively. It is assumed that the contributions of all
three factors are equal and therefore were given a value of 1/3.
Behaviour is the observable response in a given situation with respect to a given target. This value
represents an act of purchasing an A/C. The behaviour of an agent here is expressed if the value of an
attitude passes a particular threshold. The value of behaviour is binary and equal either 0 or 1.

In our case a threshold of 0.8 was chosen in keeping with the literature that reports the percentage
of variance explained by the TPB in making behavioural predictions (Hardeman et al., 2002; Armitage
& Conner, 2001). All input values in the model are normalized and fall within [0,1] interval.

2.3 Agents’ Network
The agents are organized in a small world network that resembles connections between people in a
neighbourhood or a street. The network is depicted in Figure 3. Each agent-household in the network
is connected to eight other agents-neighbours. The network was constructed using a clustering
coefficient of k = 4 meaning that the number of connections per agents are 2k = 8.

Figure 3: Small world network connections. The individual numbering goes from 1 in the centre to 70 in the last
one on the right. The lines represent the connections and the spatial location is arbitrary

This number was chosen in accordance with findings from urban studies literature (see for
example, Henning & Lieberg, 1996; Forrest, and Kearns, 2001). Connection strengths between agents
vary from 0.3 to 1 representing both strong and weak connections. Each agent has a different
distribution of strong and weak connections while the total number of connections remains constant, it
corresponds to a real world context to some extent when people may have different predispositions
towards having stronger or weaker connections with neighbours.

3 Simulation Results
A number of agent-based simulation experiments have been performed using the numerical
software Matlab. The behaviour of the agents was analysed under different settings: various initial
values of subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and attitudes. As it was stated earlier,
attitude is a function of OI in our model and thus determined by the random variability per year
depending on the projected future weather conditions. Future air conditioning purchasing behaviour
was simulated for three locations in England: Exeter, Dover and Truro. These locations are situated in
the southern part of England, potentially the most vulnerable to overheating (CIBSE, 2006). The
simulations were comprised of a 60 year time (2030 to 2090)2. First, individual simulations were
performed to observe the internal consistency of the model; secondly, due to the stochastic variability
of future weather in our model, multiple simulations were performed with different scenarios and their
results were analysed. The simulation results are described in the following subsections.

We assume in this research that buildings characteristics will remain the same over this period of time and that air
conditioning machines (or any other new future cooling technology) would have similar negative impact on environment in
future

3.1 One Simulation Example
Initial settings of the simulation correspond to the scenarios for 2030, where domestic air
conditioning in the UK may be commonplace. To represent this, the value of subjective norm was
initialised using the value that results from sampling a normal distribution with mean of 0.7 and
standard deviation of 0.05. The same initial setting was taken for the perceived behavioural control
implying the assumption that the financial capabilities of the population are sufficient enough to
purchase an A/C. The value of attitude which is a function of OI varies within [0.5, 0.7] interval range
to represent quite a conservative approach towards OI influence on purchasing attitude.
An example of a simulation trace using the weather data from Exeter is depicted in Figure 4. The
five boxes represent the values of the five main variables of the model for 70 household agents within
the time span. These are: attitude towards purchasing an air conditioner machine resulting from OI
experienced in a warm period, subjective norms towards the behaviour based on the social norms,
perceived behavioural control that in this model roughly corresponds to the financial capability of
purchasing an air conditioner, intention to execute the given purchasing behaviour; and finally, the
actual behaviour.

3.2 Scenario A: High OI Tolerance
Due to the stochastic variability of the weather and the random distribution of subjective norms
and perceived behavioural control, 100 simulations3 were performed with identical initial settings for
the three locations with high OI tolerance in order to observe the average pattern of the behaviour.
High OI tolerance represents the scenario with a conservative attitude towards purchasing an air
conditioner and is defined as high if higher values of OI result in relatively lower values of attitude.
The results of the simulations are presented in Table 1. The standard deviation gives an indication of
the variability of the results per 100 simulation runs.

As seen in Table 1, on average, around 2% of households in each of the simulated neighbourhoods
installed A/C. In all three locations, the minimum number of households that installed an air
conditioner is equal to 0, but this could be due to the small number of agents used.

3.3 Scenario B: Low OI Tolerance
In this scenario human agents had lower OI tolerance. Variation in OI tolerance was achieved by
means of changing the steepness parameter  of the threshold function from 0.1 to 0.2 (See Figure 3).
This resulted in shifting the interval of average attitude values from [0.5, 0.7] to [0.6, 0.8]. The rest of
the parameters and the initial settings of the model remained unchanged. The results of the 100
simulations with this scenario are listed in Table 2.

Truro and 9.1% in Dover – it is four to six times higher than in the previous scenario (medium OI
tolerance) The minimum number of installed A/C over 100 simulations was equal to 3 occurrences of
70 households in a neighbourhood in Exeter and to 1 occurrence in a neighbourhood in Truro.

3.4 Relation between Perceived Behavioural Control and Purchasing
Behaviour
To explore the influence of the agents’ perceptions of their financial capability on their A/C
purchasing behaviour, additional simulations with varied PBC were run. The value of PBC was varied
in a systematic manner with an incrementing interval of 0.1 starting from 0.5 till maximum value of 1.
For each level of PBC 100 simulations were run. The results of this experiment for Exeter are
presented in Figure 5. Similar results were obtained for Truro and Dover. The relation between PBC
and the number of purchased A/Cs was non-linear. In the beginning when the level of PBC is
moderate, the number of purchased A/Cs is around zero while after a particular ‘threshold’, in this
case it is the value of 0.8, the number of households with air conditioning grows rapidly.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
The current paper presents a framework for modelling air conditioner purchasing behaviour based
on future weather files and the buildings characteristics. The building thermal model used for the
calculation of the OI variable has been validated with real data obtained from 70 houses in Exeter,
UK. The presented agent-based modelling framework is characterised by additional flexibility due to
the inclusion of cognitive factors and allows for the simulation of ‘what-if’ scenarios that might be
useful for building engineers, economists and policy makers investigating the consequences of
particular interventions prior to their introduction and realization. For instance, the model can simulate
how the intention to purchase an A/C machine may change as a function of improving ventilation in a
building, how intention and behaviour emerge after either reducing the prices on air conditioner
machines, or after an exposure of a population to extensive commercial campaigns promoting A/C
(thus changing social norms).
After observing the performed simulations, it could be considered that the model exhibits realistic
behaviour and is sufficiently flexible to model different scenarios. It demonstrates for instance, that
perceived behavioural control is a crucial factor on the deployment of A/C machines. If perceived
behavioural control is set to a maximum assuming a scenario in which the sample has high purchasing
ability levels, almost all households would install an A/C machine by 2090 (see Figure 5). This is in
line with the findings of McNeil and Letschert (2008) who forecasted 1.6% air conditioning
penetration rate per year for Western Europe with the help of their econometrics population-based
model.
The parameters of the agents were set to a variety of values in the current study to evaluate the
impact of these in the final result. The range of values used was based on literature and educated
intuition. However, it is important that the current agent based model is validated using real data thus
ensuring the model is as robust and ecologically valid as possible. Our future work therefore, will
concentrate on validating the modelling methodology using survey data from real occupants of homes
where internal temperatures are currently being monitored.
The current work rest upon underlying assumption concerning the development of material
artefacts and technology which may limit our model; e.g. it assumes that building characteristics will
remain the same over the period studied and that the opinions of people about A/C machines with
respect to how they affect the environment would not change within 60 years time. The former
assumption seems to be quite plausible since existing building stock is not likely to change much
within this time span. However, it is possible that - new cooling technologies with minimal energy
demand could be developed over the next 60 years, which we are unable to anticipate and therefore
include in our model. Nevertheless, the current model can be a useful simulation tool for observing
human-building interactions as a function of climate change, and behavioural factors such as control
or norm.
