Abstract
The goal of the study was applying machine learning methods to create rules for prediction
of the surface scaling resistance of concrete modiﬁed with high-calcium ﬂy ash. To determine
the scaling durability the Bor˚
as method, according to European Standard procedure (PKNCEN/TS 12390-9:2007), was used. The results of numeral experiments were utilized as a
training set to generate rules indicating the relation between material composition and the
scaling resistance. The classiﬁer generated by BFT algorithm from the WEKA workbench can
be used as a tool for adequate classiﬁcation of plain concretes and concretes modiﬁed with
high-calcium ﬂy ash as materials resistant or not resistant to the surface scaling.
Keywords: high calcium ﬂy ash, freeze-thaw resistance, scaling resistance, machine learning, classiﬁcation, durability prediction

Introduction

The application of high calcium ﬂy ash (HCFA) for partial replacement of Portland cement
in concrete could provide a number of environmental beneﬁts (reduced CO2 emissions during
cement production, reduced consumption of cement clinker, saving natural resources). Moreover
the high calcium ﬂy ash is produced as by-product of power generation in brown coal burning
plants. On the other hand, this type of ash is usually characterized by low silica content and an
increased content of sulfur compounds. It could be used in concrete following the requirements
of ASTM C618 class C, but it does not meet the requirements deﬁned in standard EN 450-1
and is not commonly used in European countries despite positive examples of its suitability
provided by some researchers. It was shown [10] that in the case of cement replacement with
HCFA, the compressive strength of concrete was increased if the content of active silica in the ﬂy
ash was higher than that in the cement. Similar results were obtained earlier by Naik et al. [9]:
partial replacement of cement by ﬁne grained HCFA resulted in the same or better compressive

strength of concrete; the results for drying shrinkage were also positive. The optimization of
ﬁneness coupled with the adjustment of water content were found as the key parameters of
eﬀective utilization of high-calcium ﬂy ashes for strength maximization of cement mortars [2].
There are only few papers on the freeze-thaw resistance of concrete containing calcareous
ﬂy ash. According to Yazici [17], calcareous ﬂy ash added at a rate of between 30% and 60%
improves the resistance of non-air-entrained concrete to internal damage due to freeze-thaw
cycling. This, however, is contrary to the ﬁndings described in [4], namely that the addition
of calcium-type ﬂy ash has an adverse eﬀect on the freeze-thaw resistance of non-air-entrained
concrete [1]. All mentioned results concentrate mostly on internal frost resistance not on the
surface scaling resistance, so providing rules for surface scaling resistance assessment is even
more signiﬁcant.
Prediction of engineering properties of composite materials is usually based on experimental
test results with a reference to observed material microstructure. The relevant material characteristics can be extracted from experimental dataset using various computational intelligence
methods, developed for the last two decades for various engineering applications [5, 8]. Artiﬁcial neural networks were successfully used for prediction of compressive strength of concrete
containing coal ash [12] or silica fume [14]. Using neural networks and optimization technologies
it was possible to search for the optimum mixture of concrete - the mixture with the lowest
cost and required performance, such as strength and slump [18]. Machine learning methods
were also tested on classiﬁcation of concrete modiﬁed by ﬂuidized bed ﬂy ash as materials of
adequate resistance to chloride penetration [6] and resistance to the surface scaling [7].
The aim of this research was to generate rules using machine learning algorithms to evaluate
the de-icing salt scaling resistance of concrete manufactured using calcareous ﬂy ash as a mix
additive or introduced as one of the main constituents of blended cements.

Composition of concrete mixes and test results of scaling resistance coeﬃcient

The surface scaling resistance in concrete specimens with diﬀerent content of high calcium ﬂy
ash was experimentally measured. Concrete mixes were prepared with replacement of 15% or
30% of cement mass by HCFA. Experimental tests were performed on several mixes, based on
two types of Portland cement C1 – CEM I 42.5R (with 10 percent of C3 A content) or C2 –
CEM I 42.5 HSR NA (with 2 percent of C3 A content), siliceous sand fraction 0 ÷ 2 mm and the
amphibolite as a coarse aggregate (two fractions 2÷8 mm and 8÷16 mm). Because of expected
variability of ash properties six lots of high calcium ﬂy ash were tested from diﬀerent deliveries
from the Belchat´
ow power plant, namely S1 – March 2010, S2 – May 2010, S3 – June 2010, S4 –
November 2010, S5 – March 2011 and S6 – September 2011. HCFA was used as an additive to
concrete mix in unprocessed form (as collected) and after grinding (physical properties of ash
before and after grinding are given in Table 1). Chemical properties of HCFA lots are shown
in Table 2.
In order to determine the scaling resistance of concrete specimens a series of tests were
performed according to European Standard procedure (PKN-CEN/TS 12390-9:2007). The
upper horizontal surface of the specimens (the cut surface) was exposed to freezing and thawing
while the remaining surfaces were isolated against humidity and heat transfer. After 28 days
of curing the top exposed surface was covered with 3% NaCl solution. The mean mass of
scaled material after 28 (m28 ) and 56 (m56 ) cycles is used for evaluating the scaling resistance,
according to the criteria presented in Table 3. The Bor˚

Prediction of engineering properties of composite materials based on Machine Learning techniques
Introduction to machine learning

Determining relationship between material composition and the surface scaling resistance of
concrete is a diﬃcult and time-consuming process even in case a small dataset as presented in
Table 4. This task can be done manually, however using an automatic data exploration tools is
much more eﬃcient. A branch of artiﬁcial intelligence concerned with the applying algorithms
that allow computers to evolve patterns based on empirical data is called machine learning.
A major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex
patterns and make intelligent decisions based on dataset, i.e. collection of logically related
records. Each record can be called an example or instance and each one is characterized by the
values of predetermined attributes. The major diﬃculty is the fact that the set of all possible
behaviors given all possible inputs is too large to be covered by the set of observed examples
(training data). Hence the learner must generalize from the given examples, so as to be able to
produce a useful output in new cases.
Patterns recognition associated usually with classiﬁcation is the most popular example of
utilizing machine learning. However machine learning or, more general, statistical algorithms
can support the knowledge discovery on diﬀerent stages from outliers detection and attributes
(features) selection to knowledge modeling and models validation.

3.2

Attributes selection

Attribute selection, also known as feature selection, variable selection or feature reduction, is
the technique of selecting a subset of relevant features for building robust learning models.
By removing most irrelevant and redundant attributes from the data, feature selection helps
improve the performance of learning models by: speeding up learning process and alleviating
the eﬀect of the curse of dimensionality. Moreover the irrerelevant attributes degrade the
performance of state-of-the-art decision tree and rule learners [15].

3.3

Classiﬁcation

As noted earlier in section 3.1 classiﬁcation is the most common type of machine learning applications. The aim of the classiﬁcation process is to learn a way of classifying unseen examples
based on the knowledge extracted from the provided set of classiﬁed examples. In order to extract the knowledge from the provided dataset the attribute set characterizing the example has
to be divided into two groups: the class attribute and the non-class attributes. For an unseen
examples only non-class attributes are known, therefore the aim of data mining algorithms is

to build such a knowledge model that allows predicting the example class membership based
only on non-class attributes.
The knowledge model is dependent on the way how the classiﬁer is constructed and it can
be represented by decision trees (e.g. algorithm C4.5, [11]), classiﬁcation rules (the algorithm
AQ21 [16]) or many other representations. Regardless of the representation both decision trees
and classiﬁcation rules algorithms create hypotheses.
In considered problem the surface scaling resistance of concrete (class attribute) depending on material composition and additives properties (non-class attributes) is searched. This
search can be done using one of many software suites available on the market such as: Weka,
RapidMiner, LIONsolver, KNIME, See5 and many others. In our experiments we decided to
utilize WEKA workbench [15]. This software suite contains almost one hundred algorithms representing diﬀerent approaches to machine learning such as: bayesian networks, decision trees
or association rules. In our experiments we concentrated on the representative of decision trees
classiﬁer – the BFT algorithm [13] – the well known modiﬁcation of the last publicly available
version of a C4.5 method developed by J. Ross Quinlan [11]. This algorithm was compared with
other available in Weka algorithms in section 4.2.

Searching for the rules describing the surface scaling
resistance of concrete modiﬁed with high-calcium ﬂy
ash
Attributes selection

In Table 4 the dataset with 6 composition attributes is presented. However these attributes
are expressed in absolute values, so they are not appropriate for comparisons. To alleviate this
inconvenience the modiﬁed database with concrete mix composition expressed in percentage,
additions to cement ratio (A2C) and additions properties like speciﬁc surface by Blaine (BL)
and density (DE) is provided – (Table 5). Due to small number of instances we decided to
express class attribute in the working database in a binary form, i.e. all examples with class
very good, good and acceptable are represented as resistant instances and all example with
unacceptable resistance as not resistant.
It is clear that for database with a few dozens of instances this number of attributes (9
attributes) is too large. Some attributes can be eliminated but it is important to eliminate
the most irrelevant attributes. So that we decided to evaluate a subset of attributes using
best ﬁrst and exhaustive approaches to features selection. Best ﬁrst method searches the space
of attributes by greedy hillclimbing augmented with backtracking facility. In both cases the
CfsSubsetEvaluator, provided by Weka, was used to assess the predictive ability of each attribute
individually and the degree of redundancy among them, preferring sets of attributes that are
highly correlated with the class but have low intercorrelation. Both methods of searching (best
ﬁrst and exhaustive) resulted in selection of C, HCFA, A2C, BL and DE as the most relevant
attributes.
Therefore, in order to generate rules describing the surface scaling resistance of concrete
modiﬁed with high-calcium ﬂy ash the subset of attributes (C, HCFA, A2C, BL, DE, class) from the
database (marked with bold in Table 5) is used. The shrunken database contains 31 records,
each one described by 5 numerical and one nominal attributes. The last attribute – class –
denotes a class and can take one of two values (resistant, not resistant).

Classiﬁcation

As it was mentioned in section 3.3 surface scaling resistance of concrete depending on material
composition can be searched using one of many software suites available on the market and
we decided to utilize WEKA workbench. The WEKA workbench provides a collection almost
one hundred algorithms supporting classiﬁcation. They belong to diﬀerent types like: bayesian
classiﬁers, rules classiﬁers, trees classiﬁers or meta classiﬁers. In our research we decided to
determine the surface scaling durability of concrete using selected 8 algorithms belonging to
three diﬀerent types of algorithms. As an training set all the instances from the database
(Table 5) were considered. The classiﬁcation accuracy was evaluated using leave-one-out cross
validation [15]. The obtained results are collected in Table 6.

The best accuracy equal almost 75% was obtained using BFT and LADTree algorithms. The
decision tree generated by BFT algorithm is presented in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: The decision tree for scaling resistance generated by BFT algorithm
In Fig. 1 the ﬁrst number in brackets denotes the number of examples from the training
set covered by a selected leaf, and the second number – just after the sign ”/” – indicates the
number of incorrectly classiﬁed instances (negative examples).
The obtained decision tree can be easily transformed into the following rules:
[class = resistant]
rule 1 [C≥12.43%]: p = 10, n = 0,
rule 2 [C<12.43%] and [A2C≤30.45%] and [BL>2045]: p = 4, n = 2.
[class = not resistant]
rule 1 [C<12.43%] and [A2C>30.45%]: p = 9, n = 1,
rule 2 [C<12.43%] and [A2C≤30.45%] and [BL≤2045]: p = 2, n = 0.

where p denotes the number of positive examples covered by the rule (i.e. the number of records
from this class satisfying the rule), n denotes the number of negative examples covered by the
rule (i.e. the number of records from the other classes satisfying the rule).
The obtained decision rules determines conditions concretes have to fulﬁll to provide appropriate surface scaling resistance.
The class of resistant characterize:
• concretes with percent of cement in mix composition greater then 12.43% (C≥12.43%),

among other things – all plain concretes (with no cement mass replaced with HCFA),
• concretes with percent of cement in mix composition lower then 12.43% (C<12.43%) where
not more then 30.45% of cement mass (A2C < 30.45) was replaced by high-calcium ﬂy
ash where speciﬁc surface according to Blaine is greater then 2045 cm2 /g (BL > 2045).
The class of not resistant characterize:
• concretes with percent of cement in mix composition lower then 12.43% (C<12.43%) where
more then 30.45% of cement mass (A2C < 30.45) was replaced by HCFA,
• concretes with percent of cement in mix composition lower then 12.43% (C<12.43%)
where not more then 30.45% of cement mass (A2C < 30.45) was replaced by high-calcium
ﬂy ash where speciﬁc surface according to Blaine is lower then 2045 cm2 /g (BL ≤ 2045).
Using the method leave-one-out (n = 31) we obtained the classiﬁcation accuracy equal
74.19%. The result obtained from a test set is often displayed as a two-dimensional confusion
matrix with a row and a column for each class. Each matrix element shows the number of
test examples for which the actual class is the row and the predicted class is the column. The
sum of the numbers down the main diagonal divided by the total number of test examples
determine classiﬁcation accuracy. The confusion matrix of the solved problem is determined in
the following form:

resistant
not resistant

resistant
12
3

not resistant
5
11

Such a result can be considered satisfactory in respect to the very limited number of records
in the database.

Conclusions

The rules generated by algorithm BFT from the WEKA workbench provided means for adequate
classiﬁcation of plain concretes and concretes modiﬁed with high-calcium ﬂy ash as materials
resistant or not resistant to surface scaling. According to generated rules may state that obtaining concrete mixes with good surface scaling resistance require using not more then 30%
of HCFA. Moreover HCFA additions should be characterized by not too small speciﬁc surface.
In majority of cases appropriate speciﬁc surface can be obtained by additions grinding. Due
to a small number of tested specimens the rules are applicable only to concrete mix compositions of similar binder content. Further tests are needed in order to enlarge the experimental
database and to cover broader range of concrete compositions, especially that plain concretes
with unacceptable surface scaling resistance was not represented in considered dataset.
