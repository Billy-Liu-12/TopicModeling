Abstract
Recently, we have developed several techniques in order to accelerate Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulations. For that purpose, two strategies were followed. In the ﬁrst, new algorithms
were proposed as a set of early rejection schemes performing faster than the conventional algorithm while preserving the accuracy of the method. On the other hand, a reweighting and
reconstruction scheme was introduced that is capable of retrieving primary quantities and second derivative properties at several thermodynamic conditions from a single MC Markov chain.
The latter scheme, was ﬁrst developed to extrapolate quantities in N V T ensemble for structureless Lennard-Jones particles. However, it is evident that for most real life applications the
N pT ensemble is more convenient, as pressure and temperature are usually known. Therefore,
in this paper we present an extension to the reweighting and reconstruction method to solve
N pT problems utilizing the same Markov chains generated by the N V T ensemble simulations.
Eventually, the new approach allows elegant switching between the two ensembles for several
quantities at a wide range of neighboring thermodynamic conditions.
Keywords: Reweighting and reconstruction, Monte Carlo Markov chain, N V T and N pT ensembles

Introduction

Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulations are based on the principles of statistical thermodynamics that provide a link between microscopic properties of matter and its bulk ones [1–3].
In other words, by MC molecular simulations we attempt to study matter in a detailed fashion
by describing it at the molecular level utilizing the fundamental concepts of statistical thermodynamics. As a consequence of this detailed insight, molecular simulations are, in general,
computationally much more expensive than classical models that are established based on the
continuum assumptions. These detailed information, which are inquired from the microscopic

level description, are collected in the so-called MC Markov chains. For instance, ensemble
averages such as system’s energy or pressure can be estimated by simply averaging relevant
quantities from these chains. In addition, ﬂuctuations around average could be used to estimate second derivative properties such as heat capacity and ﬂuid compressibility [4].
To overcome the burden of the high computational cost, one could accelerate MC molecular
simulations by extracting more information from these Markov chains. This might be possible,
if the Markov chain generated by a single simulation at certain thermodynamic conditions could
predict quantities at these prescribed conditions and beyond. Thus, merely a single simulation
can replace multiple ones and save lots of computational time. This could be thought of as
an alternative path to accelerate MC simulations instead of trying to modify the Metropolis
algorithm itself [5–7].
For that purpose, researchers have developed several methods in order to retrieve more
macroscopic information from the collected Markov chains. Typical examples of such techniques
are histogram reweighting [8–10] and thermodynamic scaling [11–16]. In the ﬁrst, collective
distributions are properly re-weighted with some tunable factors in order to estimate ensemble
averages at diﬀerent conditions than the simulated ones. On the other hand, thermodynamic
scaling refers to group of approaches developed for various ensembles based on the umbrella
sampling concept [17, 18].
In this context, a novel, simple and self-consistent reweighting and reconstruction scheme
has been introduced [19,20]. In contrast to the reported methods in literature, where unphysical
non-Boltzmann distributions are utilized in addition to some tunable parameters, the proposed
extrapolation schemes retain physically meaningful distributions and do not contain any parameters to be tuned. Nonetheless, the introduced method has been, so far, accommodated for
systems of structureless identical Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles in canonical or N V T ensemble.
However, in reality pressure and temperature are controlled, as they are usually tangible and
measurable. In this article, we extend the reweighting and reconstruction scheme to encounter
N pT systems (ensembles) using the same set of Markov chains created by N V T ensemble
simulations.
In the following sections, the details of the simulation methods with the corresponding set of
equations utilized to conduct this study are ﬁrst described. Secondly, the generated results are
reported and thoroughly discussed. Moreover, the algorithms and methods used in this work
are validated by comparing the simulation results obtained versus relevant experimental data.
Finally, the article closes with set of conclusions summarizing the objectives of this study.

Simulation Methods

The reweighting and reconstruction method has been originally designed for the canonical
ensemble, which is often known as the N V T ensemble. In the N V T ensemble, the number
of simulated particles (N ), simulation cell volume (V ) and temperature (T ) are all kept ﬁxed
throughout the simulation. However, and as stated earlier, in real life experiments pressure
(p) and temperature are usually kept constant. Motivated by this fact, scholars introduced the
isothermal-isobaric ensemble or the N pT ensemble at which the pressure is imposed instead of
the volume during the simulation. In this section, the original reweighting and reconstruction
scheme developed for the N V T ensemble is at ﬁrst described. Later, the tools to switch from
the N V T ensemble to the N pT one are explained.

Primary Quantities

Primary quantities are obtained directly from the ensemble averages of the generated Markov
chains in MC molecular simulations. In this work, we focus on two ensemble averages: the
system’s potential energy per particle (E) and the system’s pressure (p). To easily express and
integrate these two terms in the reweighting and reconstruction scheme, two other generalized
conﬁgurational quantities Uk and Vk that are functions of the distances separating the simulated
particles are deﬁned. For convenience and as all the simulated particles are assumed identical,
these quantities can be normalized with respect to ε and σ. For instance, the normalized
potential energy of the k th conﬁguration (Uk∗ ) is computed by (1); where, Uk is normalized by ε
∗
∗
and distance rij is normalized by σ (rij
is divided by the normalized
= rij /σ). Furthermore, rij

∗
simulation box length (L = L/σ) such that sij = rij /L . Clearly, s∗ij represents the normalized
distance separating the ith and j th particles relative to L∗ . Therefore, s∗ij can only attain values
between 0 and 1. Similar normalization scenario is applied to the other deﬁned quantity in (2).

In these equations (1 - 4), ε and σ are model parameters related to the nature of the
simulated particle, N is the total number of particles, β ∗ is the normalized Boltzmann’s factor
and equivalent to the reciprocal of the normalized temperature (T ∗ = T /(ε/kB )), kB is the
Boltzmann’s constant and ρ∗ is the normalized number density (ρ∗ = ρσ 3 ). Whereas, X can
stands for the canonical average of property X over all the sampled conﬁgurations and subscript
“tail” corresponds to the tail correction functions used to count for truncated interactions
beyond the imposed cutoﬀ radius (rc∗ = 0.49L∗ = s∗c L∗ ). These tail correction functions [4] can

Second Derivative Quantities

In addition to ensemble averages, the ﬂuctuations of the sampled Markov chains can be used
to estimate second derivative properties. In this paper, the isochoric heat capacity (Cv ) and
the isothermal compressibility (cT ) are considered. Similar to the previous part, one additional
conﬁgurational quantity Wk is deﬁned.

Reweighting and Reconstruction Workﬂow

In the N V T ensemble, the general case for applying the reweighting and reconstruction scheme
is to predict an ensemble average A∗ can at certain temperature and density that are diﬀerent
from the ones used to generate the MC Markov chain. In other words, the general case will
be to extrapolate ensemble averages along paths of changing temperature and density at same
time. This is possible by ﬁrst reconstructing and then reweighting the original sampled Markov
chain using the following relation
A∗ (βn∗ , L∗n )

can

=

wk = βn∗ Uk∗ (βo∗ , L∗n ) − βo∗ Uk∗ (βo∗ , L∗o ) + N [βn∗ Etail
(L∗n ) − βo∗ Etail
(L∗o )]

(11)
(12)

In equations (11) and (12), reweighting factors (exp(−wk )) are related to the temperature
and energy diﬀerence between the reference case and the targeted one. The quantity, A, could
be replaced by any of the quantities U , U 2 , V , V 2 or W with “o” and “n” subscripts representing
the original thermodynamic conditions and the new ones at where the targeted point exists,
respectively. Meanwhile, M is the number of sampled conﬁgurations that are forming the
collected Markov chain out of the total created conﬁgurations.

2.4

Switching Scheme

Before describing the switching mechanism from the N V T to the N pT ensemble, the application of the classical reweighting and reconstruction scheme in predicting p∗ is ﬁrst explained.
Starting from equation (4), the following relation shows how p∗ at a new temperature (βn∗ )
1262

and density (ρ∗n ) can be estimated using the information from a Markov chain generated at
neighboring βo∗ and ρ∗o .

ρ∗n

can

+ p∗tail (L∗n )

(13)

In the equation above (13), the ideal part and the tail correction function are directly mod3
iﬁed to adhere with the new prescribed conditions (βn∗ and ρ∗n =N /L∗n ). However, the residual
part V ∗ (βn∗ , L∗n ) can is computed as explained in equation (11); such that, the reweighting
factors are evaluated as exactly shown in equation (12).
V ∗ (βn∗ , L∗n )

(14)

So far the problem is forward, as the only targeted unknown is p∗ . Nonetheless, another way
to visualize this problem is by assuming that the new pressure (p∗ (βn∗ , L∗n )) and βn∗ are given
and to look for their corresponding ρ∗n . In standard MC simulations, such new formulation
requires designing a new experimental setup which, as mentioned earlier, is called the N pT
ensemble. In other words, the numerical experiment has to be rerun again with the same
expensive computational cost. On the other hand, this work shows that such a switch between
the N V T and N pT ensembles is fairly simple when using the reweighting and reconstruction
scheme. Basically, the same equation in (13) is used but this time to search for L∗n value that
successfully retains the prescribed pressure p∗ (βn∗ , L∗n ). In the “Results and Discussion” section
the proposed scheme will be further elaborated with more details.

Results and Discussion

The extensive analysis conducted to test and validate the proposed approach, is based on a
set of 750 Markov chains generated by MC molecular simulations in N V T ensemble. This set
spans the range of 0.05 ≤ β ∗ ≤ 0.75 and 0.02 ≤ ρ∗ ≤ 1. The β ∗ range is chosen such that the
system is always at a temperature higher than the critical temperature to avoid entering the
two-phase envelope. On the other hand, ρ∗ values are decided such that cases from sparse to
highly dense systems are considered. In generating the 750 chains, a system of 256 uniformly
distributed structureless LJ particles in a cubic cell with dimensions fulﬁlling the prescribed
system’s ρ∗ is initially used. Starting from these initial conﬁgurations, a sequence of successive
conﬁgurations is created by introducing elemental changes to the system, known as MC trials.
For this particular case, particle displacement was the only possible MC trial. Therefore, at
each MC step a particle is randomly chosen and displaced. For each run, a total of 61,440,000
MC trials was performed to generate the same number of conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst 10 % of
these conﬁgurations were discarded to account for equilibration. Out of the 90% left, only one
conﬁguration was sampled every 1024 steps. As a result, each of these 750 Markov chains is made
of 54,000 sampled conﬁgurations. As a matter of fact, for the reweighting and reconstruction
method only the sum of the short range (1/s12 ) and long range (1/s6 ) interactions need to be
separately collected in the Markov chains.
This section of the paper is divided into three parts. In the ﬁrst one, the results corresponding to solving the N pT problem, at which ρ∗ is the main output, are discussed. In the
second part, the other three quantities of interest are estimated by switching back to the regular
reweighting and reconstruction scheme, as the densities corresponding to the new pressures are

data validates all the algorithms and techniques used in this work.

3.1

Solving the N pT Problem

After conducting the necessary MC simulations in N V T ensemble, a data bank of MC Markov
chains is available. In order to solve the N pT problem, p∗ is ﬁrst computed for each chain corresponding to speciﬁc β ∗ and ρ∗ using equation (4). Therefore, for every chain in the generated
data bank the three thermodynamic states β ∗ = 1/T ∗ , ρ∗ and p∗ are known. Assuming that
we want to estimate ρ∗ at a given p∗x and βx∗ , the ﬁrst step is to determine the suitable MC
Markov chain from the generated set of chains as the source of extrapolation. Considering the
case of extrapolation along isothermal paths, the chain with β ∗ equal to βx∗ and p∗ closest to
the targeted p∗x is chosen as the source point of extrapolation.
In Figure 1, seven isotherms are reproduced. Along each isotherm only 19 Markov chains
were used as source points for extrapolation. From each source point, ﬁve adjacent ρ∗ values
are predicted from each side at diﬀerent p∗ values such that the extrapolations from two consecutive source points meet at the middle. In fact, these predictions are made using equation
(13) while solving for L∗n as both p∗ (βn∗ , L∗n ) or p∗x and βn∗ or βx∗ at extrapolation points are
known. According to Figure 1, all the isotherms are well reproduced as the transitions from one
extrapolation set to another are, in most occasions, smooth. However, in agreement with results
reported in our previous papers [19, 20], the ranges of extrapolation are dependent on the thermodynamic states of the source points of extrapolation. It is observed that at low temperatures
(high β ∗ ) the ranges get narrower as the system approaches the critical temperature.

3.2

Switching back to the N V T Ensemble

As the ρ∗x values associated with diﬀerent pressures (p∗x ) of interest are all known, it is possible
now to shift back to the regular forward reweighting and reconstruction scheme to solve for the
other three properties considered using equations (3), (8) and (9). In this regard, three more

4). Again here, the plots were split into two sets for clarity. Similar to ρ∗ , extrapolation ranges
diminish as source points approach critical temperature. In addition, it is evident that for second
derivative quantities narrower ranges of extrapolation are expected when compared to primary
quantities. To sum up, the MC Markov chains generated from N V T ensemble simulations are
used to solve for density at a given pressure and temperature. To solve the inverse problem,
the MATLAB built-in non-linear solver “fsolve” was used. Whenever densities are determined,
the rest of the parameters are evaluated using the forward scheme.

3.3

Extrapolation Along Paths of Changing β and p

To take the method a step further, in fact, the extrapolation process does not have to solely be
along isotherms. It is possible to extrapolate from a certain source point to other neighboring
points at both diﬀerent temperature and pressure conditions. As an example (Figure 5), source
points (◦) along β ∗ = 0.3 were used to extrapolate points (·) at diﬀerent pressures along two
diﬀerent isotherms β ∗ = 0.25 ( ) and 0.35 ( ). The symbols ( and ) are only plotted to show

were removed to help visualize the extrapolation area covered by each source point.
Moreover and in order to get a clear idea about the extrapolation limits of the proposed
scheme, the normalised quantities (β ∗ ) are transformed into temperatures (T ) with absolute
units. By referring to Figure 5, the source points along T = 490 K isotherm (◦) were successful
in reproducing the other two isotherms with more than 70 K temperature diﬀerence from both
sides. For more details about extrapolation limits, the two earlier papers are recommended
[19, 20].

Finally the algorithms and extrapolation schemes used in this paper are all validated by comparing the data from direct simulations and extrapolated ones with respect to methane experimental data [21]. In speciﬁc, density values (Figure 6) are used in comparison. Moreover, and

Conclusion

In conclusion, motivated by the importance of the N pT ensemble in describing many of real life
processes we have introduced a self-consistent scheme that allows switching between the N V T
and N pT ensembles using the reweighting and reconstruction method. The proposed scheme
extends the capabilities of the tremendously fast reweighting and reconstruction method by
handling diﬀerent types of systems depending on the imposed parameters. Results have shown
that the range of extrapolation limits behaves similarly regardless of the switch between the
two ensembles. In agreement with previous studies, primary quantities (ρ and E) can be
extrapolated for wider ranges when compared to second derivative ones (Cv and cT ). Meanwhile,
the work is in progress to extend the reweighting and reconstruction method for other ensembles
in order to widen the investigation scope. In addition, beneﬁting from this scheme by coupling
it with ﬂow simulators is under consideration.
