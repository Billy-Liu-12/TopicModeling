Abstract
A methodology for a rapid design optimization of integrated photonic couplers is presented. The
proposed technique exploits variable-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulation models, additive
response correction for accommodating the discrepancies between the EM models of various fidelities,
and local response surface approximations for a fine tuning of the final design. A specific example of a
1,555 nm coupler is considered with an optimum design obtained at a computational cost
corresponding to about 24 high-fidelity EM simulations of the structure.
Keywords: Integrated photonics, EM-driven design, design optimization, directional couplers

1 Introduction
Integrated photonic components and circuits have attracted considerable attention due to their
potential applications in quantum computing and global communication systems with very high data
rates (Panicia and Koehl 2005; Thompson et al. 2011). The possibility of realizing photonic
components on a silicon substrate with a silica cladding allows for their integration with conventional
electrical circuits (Kaminow 2008). Furthermore, owing to high refractive index contrast, low losses
can be achieved within the waveguide, as well as compact designs (Morino et al. 2014; Littlejohns et
al. 2011). One of the simplest, yet fundamental types, of integrated photonic components are
directional couplers. Coupler structures have numerous applications in, among others, Mach-Zehnder

interferometers (Doerr et al. 2005; Petousi et al. 2015), filters (Yu et al. 2011; Zhang and Pan 2013),
and switches (de Valicourt et al. 2014; Krishnamurthy et al. 2014).
The electrical performance of integrated photonic circuits is determined by their topology and the
values of relevant geometry and material parameters (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013; Koziel and Ogurtsov,
2014; Mansoor et al. 2014). Accurate evaluation of integrated photonic circuits requires high-fidelity
electromagnetic (EM) analysis, which is computationally very expensive. Even for simple components,
simulation times may be as long as several hours, which make a simulation-driven design process
extremely challenging. In particular, the adjustment of geometry parameters by means of a direct
numerical optimization of EM simulation models is normally prohibitive when using conventional
algorithms, both gradient-based (Nocedal and Wright, 2006) and derivative-free (Conn et al. 2009).
Computationally efficient simulation-driven design of simple photonic components was presented
in (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013), where variable-fidelity EM simulations were utilized to speed up the
design process. A feature-based optimization of integrated photonic microring was demonstrated in
(Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2014), based on single-fidelity EM models. It turns out that, even for relatively
simple components, the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity EM-simulation models may be
rather poor (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2014), which hinders—to some extent—the use of variable-fidelity
simulations in the design process of photonic components.
In this paper, we demonstrate the use of variable-fidelity EM simulations for rapid design of a
photonic coupler structure. Due to a limited correlation between the models of various fidelities, a
low-fidelity EM model is only used at the initial stages of the search process. The coupler design is
subsequently fine-tuned using a local response surface model constructed from high-fidelity EM
model data only. Our methodology is illustrated using a broadband coupler designed for a C band
transmission window (Oh and Paek, 2012). The final design satisfying the prescribed performance
requirements is obtained at an overall computational cost corresponding to about 24 high-fidelity EM
simulations of the structure.

2 Integrated Photonic Components: Models and Design
Challenges
Consider an integrated photonic 2 × 2 directional coupler based on a design of Morino et al.
(2014). The structure is a four-port device with two waveguide cores arranged parallel in proximity
with each other. The coupler exhibits wavelength independent operation, which is introduced by the
utilization of a circular shape coupling section. The circuit is composed of a two silicon waveguide
cores with the refractive index of n1 = 3.476. Both cores are buried within silicon dioxide—or a socalled silica—with the refractive index of n2 = 1.444. The entire structure is allocated on a thin silicon
substrate. It should be noted that high difference in refractive indexes of the coupler allows for strong
confinement of the light beam within the core waveguides. Therefore, the former may be constructed
using low radius bends without considerable losses, and, thus, allowing for the utilization of the
structure with highly integrated devices (Morino et al. 2014; Tsuchizawa et al. 2005; Yamada et al.
2005). Geometry of the discussed integrated coupler including its visualization, top- and cross-view,
as well as detailed dimensions, are shown in Fig. 1. The structure operates as follows: a light beam is
introduced to P1 and transmitted to P2. Simultaneously, short distance between waveguide cores
results in coupling of the signal to P3, whereas P4 remains isolated.
The coupler is parameterized using the following set of independent design variables: x = [r1 α β g
T w1]T. Additionally, we assume r2 = r1/(2∙cos α), r3 = r2/cos β, w2 = w1, whereas h = 0.5 remains fixed.
All dimensions except α and β, which are expressed in degrees, are in μm (see Fig. 1b-c). It should be
noted that β is set as a variable to minimize the influence of the feed lines bending losses on a circuit
operation (Hill et al. 2003).

In a contrary to (Morino et al. 2014), where theoretical studies on a coupler have been performed
using its two-dimensional representation, we have performed the design using a fully threedimensional electromagnetic model. Optimization of a structure in such a setting is considerably more
challenging than in the two-dimensional one, because evaluation of a reliable model is very time
consuming. In order to perform the coupler design in a reasonable time-frame, its low-fidelity
electromagnetic model has been prepared. The model is constructed using ~1,050,000 mesh cells and
its average simulation time is about 22 min. Although the low-fidelity representation of a photonic
coupler is fast, it suffers from response inaccuracy. This is accounted in a surrogate-based
optimization scheme that utilizes high-fidelity model simulations. The latter is composed of roughly
20 million cells (with a simulation time ~8.17 h). Both designs are constructed in CST Microwave
Studio and simulated using its time domain solver (CST, 2013). The design objective is to achieve
equal power split for a C band transmission window, i.e., 3 dB coupling within 1,530 to 1,565 um
wavelength of interest.

3 Optimization Using Response
Approximation Surrogates

Correction

and

Local

In this section, we formulate the optimization problem and outline the proposed solution approach.
The two main stages of the design process is surrogate-based optimization (Koziel and Leifsson, 2013;
Queipo et al. 2005) involving a low-fidelity model obtained from coarse-discretization EM
simulations of the coupler structure enhanced through additive response correction, as well as the
tuning stage exploiting a local response surface approximation model. Numerical results obtained for
the example coupler structure of Section 2 are presented in Section 4.

3.1 Problem Formulation and Objective Function
The design problem is formulated as a nonlinear minimization task of the form
x*

arg min U  R f ( x ) 

(1)

x

where Rf is the high-fidelity coupler model, x is the vector of adjustable geometry parameters, whereas
U is the objective function. In this work, we aim at obtaining equal power split within certain range of
wavelengths of interest Omin to Omax and within certain assumed tolerance 's. The objective function is
therefore defined as
U ( R f ( x)) max{Omin d O d Omax :| | S21 ( x; O ) |  | S31 ( x; O ) | |}

(2)

x

Acceptable designs are those for which U(Rf(x)) does not exceed 's.

3.2 Design Methodology I: Surrogate-Based Optimization Using
Variable-Fidelity EM Simulations and Response Correction
Because the high-fidelity EM simulations of the photonic components are computationally
expensive, their direct optimization (a straightforward attempts to solve (2)), in particular, may not be
practical. Here, we use a coarse-discretization version of Rf, referred to as the low-fidelity model Rc, to

828

Fast Optimization of Integrated Photonic Components Using Response Correction and Local
Approximation Surrogates

speed up the design process. In particular, we replace the direct solution of (2) by an iterative process
defined as (Bandler et al. 2004; Koziel et al. 2008)
arg min U  Rs(i ) ( x) 

x (i 1)

(3)

x

where x(i), i = 0, 1, …, is a sequence of approximate solutions to (2); x(0) is the initial design. Rs(i) is the
surrogate model at iteration i, which is constructed using a simple additive response correction of the
form:
Rs(i ) ( x)

Rc ( x)  ª¬ R f ( x (i ) )  Rc ( x (i ) ) º¼

(4)

The correction term in (4) ensures a perfect matching—zero-order consistency (Alexandrov et al. 2001;
Bekasiewicz et al. 2014)—between the surrogate and the high-fidelity model at x(i), i.e., Rs(i)(x(i)) =
Rf(x(i)). This simple way of constructing the surrogate model is sufficient in our case due to relatively flat
responses of the coupler (cf. Fig. 2). Because the particular relationships between the low- and highfidelity model responses are generally design dependent, the process (3), (4) has to be iterated.
The first stage of the optimization process is continued until the subsequent iterations result in the
improvement of the high-fidelity objective function, i.e., U(Rf(x(i+1))) < U(Rf(x(i))). In practice, because
of limited correlations between the low- and high-fidelity models, one may expect a few successful
iterations (3)-(4).

3.3 Design Methodology II: Fine Tuning Using Local Approximation
Models
The fine tuning of the coupler is realized using the following second-order polynomial model
established in the vicinity of the design obtained in the first stage:
p( x )

p([ x1 ... xn ]T )

n

n

k 1

k 1

p0  ¦ pk xk ¦ pn k xk2

(5)

where xk is the kth components of the parameter vector x. The model p is set up using 2n + 1
evaluations of the high-fidelity model at the design obtained at the first stage of the process and 2n
perturbed designs (up and down with respect to each if its components). The model parameters can be
obtained analytically by solving an appropriate linear regression problem.
The final design is obtained simply by optimizing the model p using the original objective
function (2). The model optimization is carried out within the region defined by the perturbations
utilized to get the training data.

4 Results and Discussion
The technique described in Section 2 has been utilized to optimize the coupler structure of
Section 2. The operating wavelength is 1,550 nm. The assumed tolerance for the power split is 's =
r0.1 dB for the wavelength range Omin = 1,530 nm to Omax = 1,565 nm. The initial design is x(0) = [18
28 13 0.18 0.21 0.38]T. The final design x* = [19 29 14.9 0.17 0.2067 0.38] T was obtained after three
iterations of the initial stage (cf. (3), (4)), and the tuning stage of Section 3.3. A single iteration (3)
requires (on average) 50 evaluations of the low-fidelity model and one evaluation of the high-fidelity
model. Only approximate optimum of the surrogate model is obtained in each iteration in order to

829

reduce the computational cost of the process. A pattern search algorithm (Kolda et al. 2003) is utilized
as an optimization engine in this stage. The routine utilizes a simple mechanism that seeks the next
candidate solution by moving along the predefined grid. For more detailed description of the algorithm
see (Koziel, 2010). Figure 2 illustrates low- and high-fidelity model responses at the initial design.
High-fidelity model responses before and after the tuning stage are shows in Fig. 3. The range of
wavelengths for which the power split imbalance does not exceed the prescribed tolerance is 42 nm
and it is preserved from 1,530 to 1,572 nm. It should be noted that the obtained range is 20% larger
than the required one.
The optimized curved coupler has been compared in terms of the wavelength range with a
conventional state-of-the art design of (Bekasiewicz and Koziel, 2015). The latter has been designated
to operate on 1,538 nm thus direct comparison may be conducted. The range of wavelength with
assumed 0.2 dB power imbalance for conventional structure is only 8 nm and it varies from 1,535 to
1,543 nm, which means that its scope of operation is over 5 times narrower than for the curved design.
The total design cost corresponds to about 24 high-fidelity simulations of the coupler structure and
it includes: 150 Rc simulations for surrogate-based optimization, as well as 4 Rf and 13 Rf simulations
for the low-fidelity model correction and the structure fine tuning, respectively. The detailed cost
breakdown is shown in Table 1. The results obtained indicate the applicability of surrogate-based
optimization for fast and reliable design of integrated photonic couplers using their complex, yet
accurate three-dimensional models. It should be noted that the computational cost of design
optimization may be considerably reduced by means of distributed computing. The estimated cost of
algorithm operation using parallel computations corresponds to 6 Rf and 1 Rf for the stage one and
two, respectively.

5 Conclusion
A time-wise feasible simulation-driven design optimization of integrated photonic couplers has
been presented. The proposed approach is a two-stage process with the first stage exploiting variablefidelity electromagnetic simulations of the coupler structure as well as response correction aimed at
reducing misalignment between the models of various fidelities. The second stage is a fine-tuning
procedure that utilizes a local response surface approximation model of the coupler. The results
obtained for an example coupler indicate that the optimized design can be obtained at the reasonable
computational cost (here, corresponding to about 24 simulations of the coupler at fine discretization).
Future work will be focused on the application of the discussed algorithms to more complex integrated
photonic structures.
