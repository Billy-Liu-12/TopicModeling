Abstract
High quality Electrocardiogram (ECG) data is very important because this signal is generally
used for the analysis of heart diseases. Wearable sensors are widely adopted for physical activity
monitoring and for the provision of healthcare services, but noise always degrades the quality
of these signals. This paper describes a new algorithm for ECG signal denoising, applicable in
the contest of the real-time health monitoring using mobile devices, where the signal processing
eﬃciency is a strict requirement. The proposed algorithm is computationally cheap because
it belongs to the class of Inﬁnite Impulse Response (IIR) noise reduction algorithms. The
main contribution of the proposed scheme is that removes the noise’s frequencies without the
implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform that would require the use of special optimized
libraries. It is composed by only few code lines and hence oﬀers the possibility of implementation
on mobile computing devices in an easy way. Moreover, the scheme allows the local denoising
and hence a real time visualization of the denoised signal. Experiments on real datasets have
been carried out in order to test the algorithm from accuracy and computational point of view.

Introduction

The accurate analysis of noisy Electrocardiogram (ECG) data is a very interesting challenge.
This is especially true in relation to the pervasive use of wearable healthcare monitoring systems
[21], where physiological data acquired from real life can be used for remote healthcare scenarios,
for the early analysis of diseases (e.g. [22]), or for highlighting of correlations between health and
a correct lifestyle (e.g. [23]). The ECG biomedical signal (see Figure 1) is composed of weak nonstationary data which are aﬀected by various types of noises: power line interference, baseline

drift, electromyography interference and sensor contact noise. Generally, a good denoising
scheme has the capability of removing noises, from the acquired signal, by ﬁltering the data
and by ensuring a result as close as possible to the unknown original signal. In literature, there
are numerous research papers devoted to this problem, including: adaptive ﬁltering [24, 20],
Wiener ﬁltering [5], Empirical Mode Decomposition [2], and wavelet denoising [19] (for other
methods see [13]). However, these approaches are suitable for desktop use, but are not optimized
for mobile use. This is a strong limitation, because, as documented in [15], healthcare systems
are undergoing a mutation. In fact, the new technologies enable new channels for delivering
health services, moving these to mobile health services. The Internet, tablets, smartphones,
remote monitoring, and wireless applications and devices, including wearable devices such as a
wrist watch or a small bandage that can monitor patients continuously [3], contribute to the
building of new mobile systems in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. In this
new scenario of health care, new approaches based on novel algorithms and smart software
framework are widely explored for improving mobile health care (m-healt) services especially
for recording and ﬁltering biomedical signals [16, 6, 18]. In the contest of real time signal
processing, two new aspects are demanded, the computational eﬃciency of the algorithm and
the ability of local signal processing. In this paper, starting from a methodology based on
Recursive Filtering, applied successfully by the authors in another research ﬁeld [27, 8, 9, 10],
we propose a novel numerical scheme for ECG Signal denoising with low computational cost,
in terms of memory and time consuming. It removes all artifacts on the ECGs that have the
spectrum frequency range known and limited. Our approach is based on the analysis of the
signal in the Fourier domain, but it does not require a direct application of the (Fast) Fourier
Transform. With respect to other methods, we compute the solution with only a few ﬂoating
point operations. Moreover, it supports suitable ﬁtting conditions that allow to the scheme the
local denoising and hence the visualization of the denoised signal in real time. The other ﬁlters,
reported above, can work very well on the entire signal, but for a local denoising, they need of
appropriate ﬁtting conditions on two consecutive parts of the signal that are contained in two
successive data packets sent by the wearable sensor. This feature makes the scheme suitable for
direct implementation in applications on mobile devices, dedicated to the real time ﬁltering of
biomedical signals. In order to test the algorithm, we report the performance metrics achieved
by applying the proposed methodology to some records of the database PhysioNet [12], that
oﬀers a large collection of recorded physiological ECG signals. The paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we give some preliminary mathematical considerations; section 3 is devoted to the
numerical scheme; in section 4 we report the numerical experiments and, ﬁnally, in section 5

Mathematical Preliminaries

In this section we give the mathematical preliminaries of a scheme for the ﬁltering of digital
signals with a computational cost of O(n) ﬂoating point operations. This scheme is based on
an approximation of a continuous convolution with a suitable convolution function h. Let s0
denote a real function such that
s0 = s +

with s the original signal and a noise function. In computer vision, researchers as in (e.g. [4])
use the convolution of s0 with a function h, Lebesgue integrable, to obtain a denoised function
sh , i.e.:
sh (t) = [h ∗ s0 ](t) =

+∞

−∞

h(t − x)s0 (x)dx, ∀t ∈ R.

(1)

The focus of this section is to determine suitable properties for the function h in order to
determine a denoising scheme. The scheme has to eliminate noises with frequency spectrum
that wanders in a limited range. To this aim, we use the following mathematical tools:
• the Fourier Transform F of a signal f :
+∞

1
F (ω) = F (f )(ω) = √
2π

−∞

f (x)e−iωx dx, ∀ω ∈ R;

(2)

• the Fourier anti-Transform F −1 of F :
1
f (t) = F −1 (F )(t) = √
2π
• the convolution theorem

+∞
−∞

F (x)eitx dx, ∀t ∈ R;

F (h ∗ f ) = F(h) · F (F ) = H · F.

(3)

(4)

The main idea of this work is to ﬁnd a suitable convolution kernel h, to denoise s0 , starting
from its Fourier Transform H = F(h) in the Fourier domain. Now, let us suppose that
Sh = F (sh ),

S0 = F (s0 ),

S = F(s)

and

E = F( ).

If we assume that the Fourier Transform H = F(h) of h is such that:
H · S = S,
H · E = 0,

(5)

then, it can be easily proved that it holds that:
sh = h ∗ s0 ≡ s.

(6)

Observing that, if the original and noise signals, s and , have the property:
supp S ∩ supp E = ∅,

(7)

in the Fourier domain, then, it is possible to obtain an inﬁnite class of functions that satisfy
condition (5). Then, in these hypotheses, the original signal s can be completely restored by
the convolution in (6). Nevertheless, as shown in the next example, a satisfying solution sh (an
approximation of s) can be achieved without assuming (7), and by ﬁltering the signal s0 by
means of a certain convolution kernel.

Figure 3: Left: the noisy ECG signal s0 = s + . Right: F −Transform S0 = F(s0 ) of s0 , sum of S = F (s)
(black line) and of E = F ( ) (red line)
Now, let s be an original ECG signal (Figure 2, left) and s0 = s + (Figure 3, left) the noisy
signal, obtained by the noise function . Here we take as the Base Line Wander noise (e.g.[2])
Assuming that the interval [μ − σ, μ + σ] contains the support of the Fourier Transform E, i.e.
supp E ⊆ [μ − σ, μ + σ], then we consider a convolution kernel h = F −1 (H), where H is set as:
H(ω) =

0,
1,

if ω ∈ [μ − σ, μ + σ];
otherwise.

(8)

With these assumptions, a way of obtaining a denoised signal sh is given by the following steps:
(i) F -Transform s0 , to obtain S0 = F (s0 ) = S + E (S and S0 are shown, respectively, on the
right-hand side of Figure 2 and of Figure3);
(ii) deﬁne the function H as in (8);
(iii) multiply H for S0 , to achieve Sh = H · S0 (left of Figure 4);
(iv) F −1 -Transform Sh = H · S0 , to extract from s0 the signal sh = F −1 (Sh ) (Figure 4, right).

All these ﬁgures have been generated by a Matlab code (Code 1) that uses the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) (e.g. [26]), in order to implement
steps (i)–(iv). This code takes into account the symmetry of supp E in the Fourier domain,
when is a periodic function. In particular in Code 1, the parameters μ, σ of (8) are set as
μ = 0.4 Hz and σ = 0.3 Hz.

We highlight that the right of Figure 3 indicates that supp S∩supp E = ∅, but after applying the
Code 1, in which H is set as 0 also on supp S∩supp E, the signal sh (right of Figure 4) can anyway
be considered an accurate approximation of s (Figure 2, left). However, the mathematical
form of H in (8), and its discontinuities, prevent us from determining our numerical scheme.
Therefore, for our purpose, as we will show in the next section, instead of H, we will use a
˜ that emulates the properties of H. This function is deﬁned as:

Observe that it is still possible to compute the denoised signal sh˜ by means of Code 1, replacing
˜ in (9). The choice of function H
˜ in (9) can determine the noisy , even if its
H in (8) by H
frequency spectrum is wandering in the interval [μ − σ, μ + σ]. Moreover, with this function, it
is possible to provide a numerical scheme to obtain the denoised function sh˜ from s0 as shown
in next section.

A novel O(n) Numerical Scheme

In this section, we introduce the derivation of our scheme for the denoising of digital signals.
This algorithm is based on the Inﬁnite Impulse Response (IIR) Gaussian Recursive Filter of
[27]. It reduces the eﬀects of additive noise functions on the original signal s, when supp E ⊂
[μ − σ, μ + σ]. In terms of ﬂoating point operations, this algorithm is faster than FFT: as we
will show later, it has a computational cost of O(n), while FFT has a cost of n log(n).
˜ = F −1 (H),
˜ with H
˜ deﬁned as
As a preliminary remark, we observe that if S0 = F(s0 ) and if h
˜
in (9), then for the function sh˜ = h ∗ s0 it holds that
˜ l ∗ (h
˜ r ∗ s0 )
sh˜ = h

(13)

˜ l and h
˜ r are deﬁned as
where functions h
˜ l = F −1 (H
˜l)
h

and

˜ r = F −1 (H
˜ r ),
h

˜ l and H
˜ r are as in (12). In order to determine a numerical scheme, we need to
and functions H
sample the signals s, s0 . From now on, we will consider the discrete signals:
s0 = (s0 [1], . . . , s0 [n]),

s = (s[1], . . . , s[n])

and

0

= ( [1], . . . , [n])

obtained from s0 , s, , by using an uniform discretization with stepsize τ , i.e.:
s0 [j] = s0 (jτ ), s[j] = s(jτ ),

[j] = (jτ ),

j = 1, ..., n.

(14)

It is well known that for the frequency range of discrete signals it holds that:

(15)

where φd = 1/τ and ω = 2πφ. Our scheme is based on the discretization of the continuous
scheme:
˜l · H
˜ r · S0 ,
Sh˜ = H

(16)

˜ l and H
˜ r are deﬁned as in (12). The poles of these functions lie in the left-half plane of
where H
complex plane hence represent respectively cause and anti-cause stable diﬀerential equations for
continuous signals that can be transformed into causal and anti-causal diﬀerence equations for
discrete signals by means of standard technique; classic methods are bilinear transform, ﬁnite
diﬀerences, the zero-pole matching method and others (e.g. [17]). For our scheme we have
used the zero-pole matching method. This approach has the advantage of transforming stable
diﬀerential equations into stable diﬀerence equations and of not using approximations like the
others. Let s0 be a discrete signal with sampling step τ , by applying the zero-pole matching
˜l · H
˜ r · S0 , we obtain the following forward and
method (e.g. [17]) to continuous scheme Sh˜ = H
backward denoising numerical scheme.

a1 sh˜ [j + 1] + a2 sh˜ [j + 2] j = n, ..., 1 : −1

where the recursive scheme coeﬃcients in (17) are:

(18)

The computational cost of the forward and backward diﬀerence scheme in (17) is:
T (n) = 18 n tcalc .

(19)

where n is the size of the discrete signals s0 , ph˜ and sh˜ and tcalc is the time for a ﬂoating point
operation. To close equations in (17), at the borders, we have to ﬁx the initial conditions: we
assume that signals s0 , ph˜ and sh˜ exist and we set a constant value for indexes j < 1 and j > n.
Then the border conditions for s0 are the following: s0 [j] = s0 [1] for all j < 1, then for ph˜ , it
holds that ph˜ [j] = (b0 + b1 + b2 )s0 [1]/(1 − a1 − a2 ) ∀j < 1, i.e. the steady-state response to
an inﬁnite stream of s0 [1] value using the ﬁrst equation in (17); similarly, ∀j > n, the ph˜ [j]
assumes a constant value ph˜ [n], then sh˜ [j] = (b0 + b1 + b2 )ph˜ [n]/(1 − a1 − a2 ) for all j > n, i.e.
the steady-state response to an inﬁnite stream of p[n] value using the second equation in (17).
Hence, to complete the statements in (17) we ﬁx the following heuristic initial conditions for
the forward and backward procedures:
f orward conditions
ph˜ [−1] = ph˜ [0] =

(b0 + b1 + b2 )
s0 [1]

backward conditions
sh˜ [n + 2] = sh˜ [n + 1] =

(b0 + b1 + b2 )
p˜ [n]
(1 − a1 − a2 ) h

(20)

For the local denoising, that allows the visualization of the denoised signal in real time, we
have used a methology based on the work of Triggs et al. [25] for the determining of the
ﬁtting conditions between two consecutive parts of the signal. Here we have not reported these
discussions because they require complex mathematical notions but we will discuss them more
in detail in future work. We conclude the section by giving a possible scheme of the algorithm
that uses the forward and backward equations in (17). The algorithm can be used for the
denoising of a discrete signal s0 = s + , where the frequency spectrum range of is known.
The scheme of the proposed denoising algorithm, from now on indicated as the Recursive Filter
(RF), is the following:

Numerical Experiments on the ECGs

In this section, we compared, in terms of accuracy and computational cost measures, the results
of RF to them of a method that exploits the FFT as in Code 1, of a ﬁrst order zero-phase
lowpass ﬁlter (LPF) (e.g. [17]) and of a single stage of median or moving average ﬁltering
(BPF) (e.g. [7, 11]). In our experiments, we have used data from the Physionet Long-Term ST
781

A Novel O(n) Numerical Scheme

Database [12]. The Long-Term ST Database contains 86 lengthy ECG recordings of 80 human
subjects, chosen to exhibit a variety of events of ST segment changes, including ischemic ST
episodes, axis-related non-ischemic ST episodes, episodes of slow ST level drift, and episodes
containing mixtures of these phenomena. The database was created to support development
and evaluation of algorithms capable of accurately diﬀerentiating of ischemic and non-ischemic
ST events, as well as basic research into mechanisms and dynamics of myocardial ischemia.
Then a pre-processing phase is due to eliminate the additional artifact on ECGs, before using
these algorithms, for eﬃcient distinction between physiological and pathological events.
The ECG signals used, from the Long-Term ST database, last 3600 seconds (s) and are: s20011,
s20051, s20061, s20071 and s20081 and s20121. These recordings were sampled at 250 Hz using
11-bit A/D converters. We have processed in this paper only the Physionet recordings with
synthetic Base Line Wander noise added. Base Line Wander is caused by respiration or patient
movement which create problems in the detection of peaks (see Figure 1 and center of Figure
5). Due to wander the T peak would be higher than the R peak and might be detected as an
R peak instead. The amplitude variation is 15% of the peak to peak ECG amplitude. It is
normally considered below 1 Hz. The FFT method, LPF and BPF algorithms above represent
in literature the fastest and most accurate approaches for the the denoising of an ECG with a
Base Line Wander noise.
Let s0 = s+ with s, s0 and described in Section 3. The signal s0 is shown in the left of Figure
5. In the right of the same picture, we have reported sh˜ , the RF application to s0 choosing
μ = 0.25 Hz and σ = 0.9. For other kinds of artifacts μ and σ have to be chosen according to
spectrum frequency range of the noises. The ﬁrst impression is that the RF reconstructs quite
successfully the signal s also in a part of the ECG where there is a pathological (ischemic) event
(red zone of Figure 5).

length of s, s0 and sf . We highlight that here we have assumed that the Physionet signals s
are the true signals; actually, these signals also contain noise, which the metric above neglects.
In Table 1, we have reported the SNR measures, varying the ECGs chosen and varying the
ﬁlters considered. First of all, we can observe from Table 1, that the most accurate ﬁlter is, in
any case, the FFT method, with in second position the RF. Of the left-hand side of Figure 6, we
show the average results in terms of execution time and memory usage of the examined ﬁlters,

6 (left) shows that RF and LPF have the lowest time while the RF and the FFT method exploit
the lowest amount of memory. However, for a ﬁlter based on the Fourier Transform, we need
to use eﬃciently FFT-libraries [1], while our code requires the implementation of only few code
lines to remove the main artifacts from ECG recordings choosing suitable μ and σ parameters.
We think this feature the most important of this algorithm. Hence taking into consideration,
the SNR measure in Table 1 and the computational cost tests in the left of Figure 6 then RF has
the possibility of direct implementation on mobile computing or wearable sensors (equipped
with CPU). for the denoising of ECG signals. Finally, we report in the right of Figure 6 a

Conclusions

In this paper we have described the development and implementation of a scheme (RF) for
ECG Signal Denoising applicable in the contest of the real-time health monitoring, where the
signal processing eﬃciency is strictly demanded.
Numerical experiments on some ECGs from the Physionet Long-Term ST Database have
demonstrated that our RF can signiﬁcantly reduce the total computational cost of denoising
compared to other eﬃcient ﬁlters, while maintaining the same level of accuracy and using only
few code lines. In addition, we provide the theoretical development of the new scheme, based
on the study in [27], who formulated the RF in the context of signal processing to eliminate
high frequency noise. We have adapted this for ECG signal denoising, providing a description
of the process to obtain the RF coeﬃcients for the main artifacts of ECG recordings. The RF is
fast and exhibits a computational cost of only O(n). Therefore, we can implement it on mobile
computing devices to achieve improvements in e-health care ﬁeld.
