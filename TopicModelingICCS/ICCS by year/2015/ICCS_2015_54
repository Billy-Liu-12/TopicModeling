Abstract
Wildfires are critical for ecosystems in many geographical regions. However, our current urbanized
existence in these environments is inducing the ecological balance to evolve into a different dynamic
leading to the biggest fires in history. Wildfire wind speeds and directions change in an instant, and
first responders can only be effective if they take action as quickly as the conditions change. What is
lacking in disaster management today is a system integration of real-time sensor networks, satellite
imagery, near-real time data management tools, wildfire simulation tools, and connectivity to
emergency command centers before, during and after a wildfire. As a first time example of such an
integrated system, the WIFIRE project is building an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for real-time and
data-driven simulation, prediction and visualization of wildfire behavior. This paper summarizes the
approach and early results of the WIFIRE project to integrate networked observations, e.g.,
heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data with computational techniques in signal
processing, visualization, modeling and data assimilation to provide a scalable, technological, and
educational solution to monitor weather patterns to predict a wildfire’s Rate of Spread.

1 Introduction
Fire is critical for healthy ecosystems in much of the world. However, our current urbanized
existence in these environments, in conjunction with exotic vegetation growth, imported water
resources, and global climate changes, is inducing the ecological balance to evolve into a different
dynamic; a different climatological system of rainfall, wind, seasons, and thus fire seasons. In the 21st
century California, Arizona and Texas have seen their biggest fires in recorded history. In October
2003, a series of massive Santa Ana-driven wildfires erupted in Southern California. In San Diego
(SD) County the Cedar fire [1] burned 280,278 acres, 2,820 buildings and killed 15 people, including
one firefighter. In 2007, Santa Ana winds created an even larger set of wildfires, leading to the
evacuation of over half a million people in SD County, the largest fire evacuation in U.S. history, and
causing damages over $1 billion [2]. The Wallow Fire in 2011 was the largest in Arizona's history [3].

Wind speeds and directions affecting the spread of a fire can change instantly, and first responders
can only be effective if they take action as quickly as the conditions change. To deliver information
needed, we must capture the details of these conditions to understand environmental processes. SD
County is uniquely positioned to monitor and analyze these dynamics through our research sensor
networks, namely, the High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN) [4].
It was not until the last decade that we have the capacity to feed field measurements into simulations
and visualizations at high resolutions, and it is rarely available in real-time to those that need it, in this
case environmental modeling efforts.
Significant measurement instrumentation at the HPWREN and partner sites facilitates the
collection of large dimensional heterogeneous data of disparate environmental sensors that include
meteorology, vision, audio and hydrology. Integration of real-time sensor telemetry data can provide
better situational awareness integral to decision making processes for emergency response situations.
However, it is critical to provide only relevant data for environmental awareness to the recipient to
avoid “data-overload” and “sensor failure”. As the quantity of sensors in wide-area multiple-domain
environments increase, it is imperative to provide a systematic and easy-to-maintain programming
environment for data analysis in which large dimensional heterogeneous sensor data can be reduced in
real-time to a lower dimensional representation. In particular, data assimilation and parameter
estimation techniques can be used to address the need to reduce large dimensional data sets to a
parametric lower dimension suitable for analysis, interpretation and alert purposes. Such systematic
data reduction to a lower dimensional representation allows a more efficient (mobile) communication
of events for decision-making and crisis management, but the following questions need to be
addressed for effective environmental data analysis:
• How can large dimensional heterogeneous sensor data of the natural environment be analyzed
systematically to a (lower dimensional) format useful for information processing, real-time
monitoring and visualization?
• How can such data be combined with existing scientific models to allow for prediction of
propagating wildfires and potential future events to prepare within regions of highest risk?
• What quality and density of real-time sensors is necessary to improve both the predictive and
preventive capabilities of current fire models?
• How can such information processing be easily configured, programmed and computed by
users with various skill levels to formulate actual real-time data-driven environmental alerts?
In particular, what is lacking in disaster management today is a system integration of real-time
sensor networks, satellite imagery, near-real time data management tools, wildfire simulation tools,
and connectivity to emergency command centers before, during and after a firestorm.
Contributions. This paper describes the initial design of our end-to-end integrated
cyberinfrastructure, called WIFIRE, to catalyze new thinking paradigms and practices for wildfire
research and response. The presented near real-time WIFIRE software infrastructure integrates
networked observations, e.g., heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data with
computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling and data assimilation to
provide a scalable, technological, and educational solution to monitor weather patterns to predict a
wildfire’s Rate of Spread. We also present our early efforts and findings on data management,
programmability, scalability and visualization of wildfire data and workflows.

2 WIFIRE System Architecture
WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure is architected for solutions with pathways that enable joint innovation
for wildfire management and collaboration between its diverse users. WIFIRE software products
integrate wide-area multiple-domain sensor telemetry data. New data assimilation and parameter
estimation techniques reduce these large telemetry data sets to parametric lower dimension models to

Figure 1. Integrated real-time data processing and programming environment in WIFIRE.

Improving the data processing functionality for the monitoring, modeling and prediction of
wildfire spread is accomplished in WIFIRE by integrating three main components as indicated in
Figure 1: (i) a central organization of Scientific and Engineering modules within the open-source
Kepler scientific workflow system [5] that coordinate the execution of real-time data processing and
fire propagation tools on distributed computing environments, (ii) a data communication layer with
links to archives, experimental data, modeling products and heterogeneous sensor data from a diverse
set of data sources, and (iii) portals for dissemination of data to different end users that include
scientists, first responders and public notification of user-defined real-time alerts via various receivers
and Web 2.0-based public systems. The scientific workflow component includes all real-time data
processing tools for data assimilation of different wildfire spread models, recursive parameter
estimation, and real-time prediction of wildfire spread. Visualization interfaces include the Optiportal
Tiled Display, i.e., HIPerspace Wall, and STAR CAVE currently placed at Calit2 Qualcomm Institute.
Due to the central organization around scientific and engineering modules within the open-source
Kepler scientific workflow system, the WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure is built inherently scalable to
handle both large sets of heterogeneous sensor data [6] and execute computations in parallel on
distributed computing environments [7], e.g., XSEDE. The Data Communication Layer can be
extended to include different kind of data sets without altering these Kepler modules.

3 WIFIRE Subsystems
3.1 Data Communication
WIFIRE’s Data Communication Subsystem provides a layer above all data sources needed for
wildfire modeling. It handles the ingestion and integration of a diverse set of ground-based and
airborne sensor data and satellite imagery along with other experimental, modeling and geopolitical
datasets. The use of low-latency sensor data delivery mechanisms for field-deployed sensors supports
scalability and rapid availability of raw or pre-processed data. This scalable approach allows for the

simultaneous availability of such data to many processing modules, without creating an excessive load
on the networking or computing substrates. The three sensed dataset sources that are integrated and
streamed via the data communication subsystem can be summarized as follows:
• Meteorology Stations: Meteorology, a.k.a. weather stations, are collections of sensors that
record and transmit multiple environmental metrics, including wind speed and direction, air
temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. WIFIRE receives near real-time data
from HPWREN’s nineteen stations and receives updates every ten minutes from over 150
stations operated by San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E). In addition, WIFIRE collects
smaller datasets from providers including the National Park Service, and San Diego State
University’s Field Stations Program.
• Still-Image Cameras: 110 individual cameras collect color and grayscale images from 35
separate locations throughout SD County. Still-images are valuable for remotely observing
fire, smoke, and other phenomena; moreover, the locations of these phenomena can be
triangulated using multiple cameras and detection algorithms. Geospatial view sheds on the
collected camera images are being built for near-real time smoke detection and querying of the
fire location.
• Satellite and Aerial Data Products: Data taken from the Terra and Aqua units of the MODIS
satellites are used to generate one-kilometer resolution fire and smoke detection maps of the
SD County region four times a day. The WIFIRE project has modeled this data, and is
extending its software to serve it. In the future, WIFIRE will incorporate data from additional
satellites such as AVHRR, VIIRS, GOES, Landsat, and aerial data from multiple sources.
The data communication layer includes REST-based services for ingesting sensor data and derived
time-dependent parameters into geospatial databases and archives so that the data can be extracted into
any Open Geospatial Consortium compatible data format. The ingestion process connects to the
HPWREN sensor multicast streams and tests for conditional ETL rules and routes to appropriate
databases for sub-processing. Doing all the processing for incoming satellite data in RAM keeps the
processing time very low, and the data is written to permanent archives after processing.

3.2 Wildfire Behavior Modeling and Data Assimilation
For modeling wildfire growth and computing the Rate of Spread (ROS) of a wildfire, one may
distinguish between studies that focus on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of flame-wind
interactions and the semi-empirical Rothermel model [8] or it’s equivalent. CFD studies of flamewind interactions typically feature a problem size of several hundred meters and a spatial resolution on
the order of one meter. The CFD studies provide a description of the fire-driven modifications of
atmospheric conditions. Although powerful in describing wildfire dynamics and ROS, their
computational cost is high, limiting flame-scale CFD to off-line analysis of wildfire events.
Examples of operational wildfire spread models used in the US include BehavePlus [9] and
FARSITE [10]. Operational semi-empirical models can also be found in the McArthur Fire Danger
Meter in Australia [11] and the Fire Behavior Prediction System (FBPS) in Canada [12]. Spatial
information on topography, fuel content and moisture along with regional weather and wind input is
used to drive the semi-empirical models. This allows the fire spread model to adopt a regional scale
perspective and simulate a wildfire as a propagating front for long time periods under heterogeneous
conditions of terrain, fuel parameters, and weather conditions. It is clear that spatial information on
terrain, fuel parameters and weather conditions provide the a priori information needed to drive the
operational wildfire spread models. However, the dense weather sensors and remote Internet
connectivity available in WIFIRE provides a big asset to update the a posteriori information during
the computation of wildfire behavior by virtue of Data Assimilation (DA). Real-time measurements to
correct simulation errors by DA techniques have been explored in wildfire and building fire
applications [13-14] along with oceanographic and geophysical fluid flow applications [15-16].

The DA system of WIFIRE is integrated with an operational semi-empirical fire model and allows
the implementation of parameter and state estimation techniques that can serve two purposes. First, a
DA technique can be used to implement a recursive parameter estimation technique that adjusts the a
priori fuel parameters and measured or predicted a priori wind conditions. Such parameter estimation
techniques only make adjustments to the (input) parameters of the operational wildfire spread model.
Secondly, a DA technique can be used to implement a recursive state estimation technique that adjusts
the simulated fire front location with an a posteriori update/measurement of the actual fire front
location. The recursive state estimation updates the initial conditions (e.g. the states) of the operational
wildfire spread model, to provide a simulation of the fire front that is closer to the measured fire front
location. Recent examples of wild fire DA techniques for (input) parameter estimation can be found in
[14] where a spatially-uniform correction of biomass fuel and wind parameters is used. State
estimation to sequentially update the two-dimensional coordinates of markers along a discretized fire
front can be found in [17]. Input and state estimation can also be combined in a single DA technique
as developed in [18] with applications to flow field estimation.

Figure 2. Illustration of prediction and update steps via separation in models for operational wild fire
modeling with fire front/ ROS simulation and Data Assimilation algorithm.

The DA system used in WIFIRE builds upon existing and well-established recursive algorithms
formulated by the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). In
addition, extensions are made via a Bayesian framework to formulate recursive algorithms to jointly
estimate a perturbation   to the simulated state  and a perturbation   to the input  
for the operational semi-empirical wild fire model. To allow the implementation of a DA via (Kepler)
workflow components that run sequentially in time, the algorithms for the DA system in WIFIRE will
be separated in two parts, as illustrated in Figure 2. The first part is a prediction step, in which a
previous estimate of the state is evolved forward in time to the time of a new observation of the fire
front using the perturbation   and modified input   . The second step is an update step, where
the evolved estimate   of the state is updated using information from the fire front observations.
The separation between a prediction and update step is standard in the EKF and EnKF, and allows
an existing operational fire model such as FARSITE to be implemented as a separate workflow
component for the prediction step. Explicit expressions for the evolution of the error covariance (as
done in the EKF) or statistical approximation of the error covariance (as done in the EnKF) can be
implemented as separate workflow components. In addition, the update step involving the error
covariance and measurement covariance matrix based on an EKF, EnKF or Bayesian joint input and
state estimation algorithm can also be implemented as separate workflow components. In the update
step, workflow components in Kepler must pull sensor measurements to allow for real-time updates
for the operational fire model. More details on the workflow management and components in WIFIRE
will be given in the following section.

3.3 Workflow Management

A workflow is comprised of steps or tasks linked together by data dependencies. Workflows are an
integral part of the overall WIFIRE architecture to ensure system integration and programmability,
computational scalability and reproducibility of the developed data access and modeling tools.
We have chosen the Kepler Scientific Workflow System [5] and APIs to build our workflow
design and execution specific extensions. Kepler provides a graphical user interface for designing
workflows composed of a linked set of extensible and configurable components called Actors that may
execute under a rich set of different Models of Computations (MoCs). Actors are the implementation
of specific functions that need to be performed and communication between actors takes place via
tokens that contain both data and messages. The MoCs are implemented by Directors, which specify
how the communication between the actors is achieved, when actors execute, and when the overall
workflow execution stops. The designed workflows can then be run through the user interface or in
batch mode from other applications. In addition, Kepler provides a provenance framework [20] that
keeps a record of chain of custody for data and process products within a workflow design and run.

3.4 Data Mining
Data mining is an interdisciplinary field concerned with analyzing large amounts of data to
discover patterns. Data mining techniques are being applied to WIFIRE data to gain insight into
environmental conditions affecting fire behavior, e.g., analysis of data from weather stations can
determine patterns of weather data associated with Santa Ana conditions. This information can then be
used to alert firefighters of specific regions experiencing conditions susceptible to wildfires. Alerts of
changing weather conditions can be especially useful for areas surrounding an existing wildfire.
Results from data mining tasks can also feed into the fire models to provide specific data about current
environmental conditions for more accurate modeling of fire behavior.
New Kepler components for data mining are being implemented. Existing machine learning tools
and libraries such as R and MLlib [20] will be leveraged, as well as Kepler’s Distributed Data Parallel
(DDP) capability to provide a framework for scalable processing of WIFIRE data.

3.5 Visualization and Communication of Results
The WIFIRE research in visualization is building products in virtual reality, mobile data
acquisition, and web mapping. Each of these addresses important needs for fire research and response.

Our prototype uses the osgEarth, an open source geospatial graphics platform that is part of
OpenSceneGraph (OSG). The OSG is capable of being run on multi-screen tile display walls in mono
and in stereo. Its architecture is also optimized to ingest real-time data and tile hierarchies for fast
serving and consumption over the web, and can natively read standard GIS and volumetric model file
formats [22]. Using tile display walls, the resolution of the data viewed is scalable from megapixels to
tens of megapixels. The accessibility of this high-resolution display with the data has proven useful
when working with fire agencies in Southern California to understand the effects of past fires on the
landscape (see Figure 3). The high-resolution imagery and topography highlights the intricate
influence of topography on fire behavior in historic events. Taking the highest resolution imagery and
topography freely available, we used the osgEarth platform to display SD County burn scars from the
2003 Cedar fire. Figure 3 shows screenshots of the data in the Calit2 NexCAVE immersive
environment, focused in on the burned wildland-urban interface where the fire hazards remain high.
The prototype immersive virtual environment is being expanded to view multiple new datasets. To
test the ingestion of mobile photos, we have tested with twitter images taken during the most recent
firestorms in San Diego. Figure 3(b) shows three twitter images posted as billboards on the San Diego
landscape. Red lines on the ground indicate fire perimeters.
Mobile Data Acquisition. We are developing a mobile app that allows users to take and upload
pictures of active fires. The app uses the phone orientation and geographic location to accurately place
a collected image so as to recreate the view perspective of the photographer if the photo is placed in a
virtual 3D environment. We can then use those photos to plot in 3D and see the active fire in the
virtual environment. Further development will use computer vision techniques to identify the horizon
if it appears in the picture, which can then be used to geolocate the flames or smoke. If enough images
are taken, we can create dynamic estimates of a fire perimeter as a fire is traveling.
Web Maps. Web maps have been developed to make the environmental data accessible and
interactive. Users can now monitor environmental conditions and view workflow results. Although
much of the data is publicly available, they have not previously been integrated in the same interface,
e.g., HPWREN cameras can be located by the map interface and the user can correlate the location
with what the cameras can see. Model outputs (see Section 3.2) can also be viewed in this interface.

4 Early Results
4.1 WIFIRE Data Model
Management of information heterogeneity is the focal theme in the design of the data architecture
of the WIFIRE system. Weather stations produce a time-series of vector of measurements together
with the metadata of the sensors themselves; satellite data providers like NASA produce timesequences of arrays of multi-band rasters, where some of the processed data may have their own data
dictionary; ground topography, an important factor in fire simulation is often represented as digital
elevation maps; fire simulation models like FARSITE produce temporally evolving fire perimeters
(temporal polygons); wind simulators like WindNinja produce time and space-varying vector fields;
human observers and monitoring cameras produce geolocated images of fire. The data modeling task
in WIFIRE is to capture all metadata, observed data and computed data assimilated by the system into
a single common framework. To this end, we have developed a semantic semistructured data model
that covers both data and metadata. The structure of the model follows from the observation that
regardless of the source and nature of the data, all data elements are essentially spatiotemporal and can
be semantically associated with an ontology of observables. We list the primary elements of our model
through the following exposition.
•
The data model assumes the existence of an ontology which itself may be constructed from
terms and relationships from several contributing ontologies. An observable is defined as an

1639

and Resilience of Wildﬁres

ontological element that corresponds to an entity observed by a sensor. It is possible to have a
more complex observable like wind, whose properties are sensed and stored as data. In this
case the metadata system models the entity as well as its properties.
• For all measured entities or entity properties, the data model captures their spatial and
temporal resolutions.
• For some data sources, the data model is associated with a data dictionary that specifies the
domain of a variable captured by the model, e.g., NASA’s Aqua MODIS satellite creates a
thermal anomaly model that identifies regions that have fire. Our data model recognizes
geolocated arrays as a basic data type, where a cell of the array may contain a vector of values.
• Since our essential data model is spatiotemporal, we capture data sources that do not output
the actual data but rather produces an aggregate of the data over a window of observations.
A novel aspect of our metadata model stems from the requirement for enabling simulation engines
with data and capturing the output of these engines. In such cases, we treat a simulation engine as a
function that accepts a complex semistructured object and returns another semistructured object.
REST Service Interface to the Wildfire Data Model. WIFIRE currently exposes its metadata
catalog through an industry-standard REST-based interface. We provide data at minute-level
resolution from close to 170 stations around San Diego County. The interface returns data and
metadata in XML, incorporating ontologies from NASA SWEET and OGC. In addition to XML,
WIFIRE supplies selected data in additional formats such as GeoJSON, Comma-Separated-Values
(CSV), and WindNinja’s native input format. Our objective is to make it easier and faster to search for
and push data directly to software from the fire-modeling and other communities.

4.2 Workflow Use Cases
To facilitate access to geospatial data and usage of the accessed data in scientific analysis tools,
WIFIRE has implemented new Kepler GIS actors to read and write GIS files such as Shapefile, KML,
and GeoJSON. These actors can read, write, transform, and perform various operations on both vector
and raster data, and are built using GeoTools (geotools.org), an open-source Java GIS Toolkit.
Additionally, two example data-driven use case applications have been created as Kepler workflows.

4.2.1. Use Case 1: Detection of Areas Affected by Santa Ana Conditions
A use case application was created to determine areas within SD County experiencing severe fireweather conditions called Santa Ana winds, which can lead to very dangerous fire conditions. A Santa
Ana wind can be defined as a combination of values for the wind direction, wind speed, and relative
humidity. The HPWREN system currently monitors these values measured by HPWREN and SDG&E
weather stations, and sends an email alert when a station experiences Santa Ana conditions. However,
this alert only denotes that a specific point source (the weather station) is experiencing Santa Ana
conditions, and not the size of the area. It would be useful to know how large the area is surrounding
the station experiencing Santa Ana winds, e.g., how many homes are affected.
A Kepler workflow was created to determine the area around each station experiencing Santa Ana
winds by running WindNinja [23] to calculate the wind field and perform post-processing to find
Santa Ana winds. WindNinja is open-source software that computes spatially-varying wind fields.
WindNinja reads the topography, vegetation, and weather station measurements to produce a vector
field of wind speeds and directions over the input domain. The workflow queries the WIFIRE REST
interface described in Section 4.1 to download the weather station measurements. Since WindNinja
runs on domain sizes of up to 50 km by 50 km, the workflow partitions SD County into smaller tiles to
calculate the winds over the entire county. For each tile, the workflow executes a separate WindNinja
and all the WindNinja instances can run in parallel. The workflow uses Kepler’s DDP framework [7]
for executing WindNinja in parallel using either Hadoop or Spark. Note that this workflow currently is
being updated to take into account the errors in the boundaries of the tiles by including a buffering
technique for the overlaps.

Figure 4. GIS post-processing workflow that filters and extracts the wind fields matching Santa Ana winds.

The output from WindNinja is a vector field of wind speed and direction over SD County. The
workflow then performs post-processing on this field to find the areas with parameters defining Santa
Ana wind conditions. We have implemented several reusable Kepler actors that perform these
operations, some of which are shown in the post-processing sub-workflow in Figure 4.

Figure 5. (a) Output from Santa Ana Workflow shows weather stations (placemarks) and regions (red
polygons) experiencing Santa Ana winds; (b) FARSITE simulator output executed by a Kepler workflow.

Figure 5(a) shows the results for a small region in SD County: the green points are the weather
stations and the red polygons are the areas experiencing Santa Ana winds. As can be seen from the
figure, these polygons show many large areas surrounding the stations in addition to areas that do not
surround the stations. In the next version of this workflow, we plan to run WRF for more accurate
wind calculations and provide a comparison of WRF and WindNinja results.

4.2.2. Use Case 2: Run Fire Growth Model Workflows
The second use case simulates fires in SD County. For this application, we created a Kepler
workflow to run FARSITE, an open-source fire growth simulator [10]. The inputs are the topography,
fuels, weather conditions, and fire ignition site(s), and the outputs are fire perimeters and intensity,
flame length, and spread rate. As in the previous use case, the workflow uses the REST interface to
download the weather station measurements. Figure 5(b) shows the perimeters of two fires with the
same ignition location. The fire with white perimeters had “normal” weather conditions, while the fire
with red perimeters had wind speeds and relative humidity similar to Santa Ana Winds.
The first version of this workflow runs a single FARSITE instance. In a future version, we plan to
run FARSITE in parallel for different starting ignition locations and weather conditions. We are also
extending this workflow with data assimilation based on our new parameter and state estimation
techniques as described in Section 3.2.

5 Conclusions
We presented our approach and early results from the multi-disciplinary dynamic data-driven
WIFIRE project. Although some of this is work in progress, the reaction of the wildfire research
community to the project architecture and early results has been very encouraging. We believe that
