Abstract
BET proteins are epigenetic readers whose deregulation results in cancer and inflammation. We show
that BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) are globally similar with subtle differences in the
sequences and structures of their N-terminal bromodomain. Principal component analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization reveal distinct structural clusters associated with specific BET family
members, experimental methods, and source organisms. Subtle variations in structural dynamics are
evident in the acetylated lysine (Kac) binding pocket of BET bromodomains. Using multiple structural
clustering methods, we have also identified representative structures of BET proteins, which are
potentially useful for developing potential therapeutic agents.

1 Introduction
In eukaryotic cells, transcription is a tightly and spatiotemporally regulated process that relies on
the transient and non-obligated protein complexes. The formations of these complexes are regulated
by post-translational modifications such as ε-N-acetylation of lysine residues. Aberrant regulation of
acetylation levels is associated with a wide array of diseases including cancer, inflammation and viral
infection [1].
In the nucleus, lysine acetylations of histone proteins are associated with transcriptional activation
of genes, yet the molecular mechanisms and functions remain largely elusive. The molecular players
include the following proteins: writers (such as histone acetyltransferases), erasers (histone

deacetylases) and readers of epigenetic marks and epigenetic memory, in which epigenetics are
heritable alterations in gene expression that are not due to the change in DNA sequence and have been
shown to affect several generations of offspring [2].
While the epigenetic-associate proteins have emerged as attractive anti-cancer targets, efforts to
obtain comprehensive understanding of their molecular mechanisms and functions necessitate multiple
structural analysis as a prerequisite for optimum structure-based development of therapeutic agents. In
this study, we focus on structural dynamics of the readers, particularly chromatin-modifying
bromodomains, which are the only known protein recognition module that selectively recognizes and
binds ε-N-acetylated lysine (Kac) [3].
Human genome encodes for at least 46 different proteins that contain a total of 61 bromodomains,
due the presence of multiple (up to six) bromodomains in some proteins [4]. These 61 bromodomains
have been clustered into eight distinct families, based on their large sequence variations [5]. To
systematically apply existing and recent structural clustering methods, we focus on the bromo and
extra terminal (BET) family because this family has the largest number of experimental structures
among the eight families.
BET family consists of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT. Their structure comprises two
bromodomains, an extra terminal domain, and a C-terminal recruitment domain. Bromodomains adopt
an all-alpha protein fold, a bundle of four alpha helices each separated by loop regions of variable
lengths. BET proteins can also bind to multiple neighboring Kac marks with a single pocket [6], with
enhanced affinity [7] and/or simultaneously [5] by utilizing multiple bromodomains that possibly twist
like the immunoglobulin domains do at their linkers [8], suggesting cooperativity and allostery as
possible molecular mechanisms of BET proteins. During mitosis, BET proteins are recruited to
transcriptional start sites [9]. Since BET proteins regulate the transcription of oncogenes, growthpromoting and anti-apoptotic genes, the BET bromodomains possessing druggable Kac binding
pocket, are attractive targets for the design and development of potential therapeutic drugs [10] in the
form of small molecules [11] (such as JQ1 [10], a nanomolar inhibitor [12] that targets the BET
bromodomains) or stabilized peptides (such as cyclic peptides [13] or stapled peptides). These BET
inhibitors disrupt the interactions between BET and its acetylated binding partners, such as histones
(H3 and H4) [14], the N-terminal domain of androgen receptor (whose signaling is deregulated in
castration-resistant prostate cancer [15]), RelA subunit of inflammation-associated NF-κB [16]. Since
protein structures are not static but intrinsically dynamic [17], we aim to utilize multiple
experimentally available structures of BET bromodomains to investigate the structural dynamics of
these epigenetic reader modules and its Kac pocket.

2 Materials and Methods
To characterize the structural dynamics of BET N-terminal bromodomains, we have performed
structural clustering using root mean square deviation (RMSD), principal component analysis (PCA)
and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Structures were visualized using PyMOL and VMD.

2.1 Structural data
To perform systematic multiple structural analysis similarly, we first retrieved the structural data of
the BET proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). As of January 2015, no full-length structure of
any BET family member is available, but there are 118 PDB entries for BET N-terminal
bromodomain. Their PDB codes are 1X0J, 2DVQ, 2DVR, 2DVS, 2L5E, 2NXB, 2OSS, 2RFJ, 2WP2,
2YDW, 2YEK, 2YEL, 2YW5, 3AQA, 3JVJ, 3JVK, 3MUK, 3MUL, 3MXF, 3P5O, 3S91, 3SVF,

For detailed studies of multiple structures similar to those performed on other proteins such as Ras
protein [18], we generated an ensemble of multiple bromodomain structures of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4
and BRDT, and another ensemble of BRD4 only bromodomain structures, for subsequent analyses.

2.2 Structural clustering and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
To analyze the ensembles of BET bromodomain structures, we carried out pairwise RMSD
calculation, PCA and NMF. RMSD- and PCA-based clustering also enabled us to identify the
ensemble-clustroid (the structure with the least divergence to the rest of the structures) and the
representative structure for each cluster within ensembles.
In contrast to PCA that learns holistic, not parts-based representations, NMF is an unsupervised,
parts-based machine learning method. NMF involves the decomposition of a non-negative matrix V
into two non-negative matrices, W and H. NMF is based on the assumption that parts are collections
of input elements that can be added together in different combinations representing the whole object of
interest / dataset [19]. The parts produced by NMF imply subsets of elements that tend to cluster
together in sub-portion of the object / dataset [20]. A parts-based model provides both an efficient
representation of the dataset and a potential tool to learn relationships between the parts.
In our study, we have applied NMF using a multiplicative-updates algorithm [21] to analyze the
structural dynamics of bromodomain of BET proteins. The multiplicative-updates algorithm starts
with random initial values for W and H and simultaneously updates the two sub-matrices using
multiplicative rules iteratively until reaching a convergence to a local minimum. During the iterative
update, a Poisson random variable ε is added to represent Poisson noise [22].

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT are globally similar with subtle
differences in the structures of their N-terminal bromodomain.
To examine the structure of BET N-terminal bromodomains in relation to other available
experimental structures, we first selected the PDB entry 4NUD, which has the best resolution (1.20 Å)
for BRD4 structure hitherto, as a query to retrieve all experimentally available structures of BET
proteins. We performed NCBI BLASTp on the 4NUD sequence (residues N44-T166) against the PDB
database, using a cutoff of 131 as the negative log of Evalue. We used the results of 118 structures to
form Ensemble 220, consisting of 58 BRD2, 43 BRD3, 110 BRD4 and 9 BRDT N-bromodomain
structures.
Multiple sequence alignment (using the N-terminal bromodomain sequences of UniProt entries
P25440, Q15059, O60885, Q58F21, Q8K2F0, and Q9ESU6) and structural superposition of the
Ensemble 220 suggest high degree of global similarity and conservation among BRD2, BRD3, BRD4
and BRTD bromodomains in terms of sequences and structures. To perform structural superposition
for subsequent PCA, we first identified 57 positions as core residues of the BET N-bromodomain;
these residues form the most invariant region in the aligned structures of the Ensemble 220. Next, we
measured the structural distances within the Ensemble 220 using pairwise RMSD. In overall, the
median and mean pairwise RMSDs are 0.651 Å and 0.903±0.705 Å, respectively. These RMSD values
are considered to be small and suggest the high similarity between most protein structures within the

737

Multiple structural clustering of bromodomains of the BET proteins

Lukman et al.

Ensemble 220. The maximum pairwise RMSD is 4.849 Å between the 20th model of PDB entry
2YW5 (a human BRD3) and 2RFJ_A (a human BRDT). We have also used RMSD-based clustering
to identify the clustroid structure, i.e. the structure with the least divergence to the rest of the structures
in Ensemble 220, which is 4BW1_A (Figure 1). This structure was resolved in a complex with the
small molecule S5B, which is a naphthyridines derivative [23].
The histogram of pairwise RMSDs of Ensemble 220 shows three peaks, suggesting a possibility of
three structural clusters. Nevertheless, the heat map of pairwise RMSDs of Ensemble 220 (Figure 2A)
suggests at least four structural clusters. Setting the number of cluster to four, we analyzed the clusters
within Ensemble 220 and observed that the NMR structures from PDB entries 2L5E and 2YW5
(mouse BRD4 and human BRD3, respectively) were clustered into two distinct groups that contain no
X-ray crystallographic structures. Structural differences due to experimental methods have also been
prominently observed in other proteins such as p53 DNA binding domain [24], and the
methodological effects appear to be more obvious than effects due to different organisms or the
presence of some mutations. The smallest cluster of the four RMSD-based clusters of Ensemble 220
contains human BRDT structures. The RMSD-based clustering result also hints that BRD2 and BRD4
are similar in their bromodomain structures. For the four RMSD-based clusters of Ensemble 220, the
representative structures are 4BW1_A (a human BRD4), 2RFJ_A (a human BRDT), the 16th model of
2L5E (a mouse BRD3) and the 14th model of 2YW5 (a human BRD3).

Figure 1: The primary, secondary and tertiary structure of the N-terminal bromodomain of a BET protein (human
BRD4, residues 75-147, according to UniProt O60885). The tertiary structure of the clustroid of Ensemble 220
(PDB entry 4WB1) is represented in surface and cartoon; both are in the same orientation. In the surface
representation, the binding site is occupied by a small molecule S5B [23]. Secondary structures of ჴǦhelices ჴZ,
ჴA, ჴB and ჴC are colored in blue, green, orange, and red, respectively.

Since Ensemble 220 contains all members of BET, we also created Ensemble 110, which contains
only BRD4 structures. Ensemble 110 is simply a subset of the Ensemble 220. As expected, the values
of the median (0.485 Å) and mean (0.491±0.177 Å) of all pairwise RMSDs of Ensemble 110 are lower
than those of Ensemble 220, reflecting the increasing structural divergence of the latter. The maximum
pairwise RMSD is between the 3UVY_A and 3UVW_A of modest 1.112 Å. The histogram of
pairwise RMSDs of Ensemble 110 with a single peak, suggests high structural similarity among BRD4
bromodomain structures, though subtle variations exist (Figure 2B). The PDB structure 4BW4_A is
identified as the clustroid of Ensemble 110 in accordance to RMSD-based clustering. Similar to the
clustroid of Ensemble 220, the clustroid of Ensemble 110 was resolved in a complex with a
naphthyridines derivative 9B6, but this small molecule has lower IC50 (630 nM) than that of S5B
(1260 nM) [23].

3.2 Dominant principal components show distinct structural clusters
associated with experimental methods and source organisms.
To characterize inter-structural relationships of BET bromodomain, we project structures of
Ensemble 220 onto the first three principal components (PC) with the largest variance (or total meansquare displacement) of atomic positional fluctuations (Figure 3). Over 81.0% of the variance was
captured in the first three dominant principal components, and over 74.3% in the first two dominant
principal components. The first principal component separates not only NMR and crystallographic
structures, but also separates mouse and human structures of BRD3 bromodomains. The second
principal component also separates mouse and human structures of BRD3 bromodomains. The third
principal component separates BRD2 and BRD4 structures, with few minor overlaps. The plane of the
second and third principal components shows NMR structures occupying the conformational space
surrounding that of crystallographic structures, with an exception for the crystallographic human
BRDT structures from the PDB entry 2RFJ, which contribute to the largest pairwise RMSD of
Ensemble 220. This consensus result from both RMSD and PCA analysis highlights the uniqueness of
2RFJ structures. Interestingly, while mouse BRDT structure is unavailable, mouse BRDT
preferentially recognize peptides with diacetylated lysines, but not monoacetylated ones [7].
Previous PCA on other proteins, such as p53 DNA binding domain [24], also showed distinct
clusters for NMR and crystallographic structures. Our PCA observation agrees with the notion that
NMR structures are more flexible and sample wider conformational space than crystallographic
structures. Crystallographic conditions such as intermolecular crystal packings might have shift the
equilibrium of the crystal structures [25].

Using dominant PCA-based clustering, we obtained similar clusters as those of RMSD-based
clustering and identified cluster-representative structures, in which each representative structure is the
clustroid of each cluster in Ensemble 220. The representative structures are 4HXR_A (a human
BRD4), 2RFJ_C (a human BRDT), the 10th model of 2L5E (a mouse BRD3) and the 20th model of
2YW5 (a human BRD3).

3.3 BET bromodomains share common structural fold but have
structurally dynamic Kac binding pocket
Based on the trajectory that interpolates between the most dissimilar structures in the distribution
along the first dominant principal component of Ensemble 220 (Figure 4A), we observe that the
structural scaffold of the bromodomains is largely conserved. On the other hand, it is interestingly
apparent that both loop ZA (connecting the helices ჴZ and ჴA) and loop BC (connecting the helices
ჴB and ჴC) contribute to the local diversity of the BET bromodomains structure. This observation
also reflects the role of both loops in lining the Kac binding site (also termed as binding pocket) and
possibly rendering substrate specificity [5] through subtle differences in the pocket structure, as
captured through PCA. Subtle structural differences may result in significant differences in structural
dynamics, and hence affect functions, as shown in other proteins such as Ras mutants [18]. Subtle
structural changes such as a flip of a histidine residue into the Kac binding site [11] can pack against
specific natural ligands or competitive inhibitors to render selectivity. An understanding of the
structural dynamics of the pocket structures is essential for protein engineering and design of potential
therapeutic agents such as small molecules and stabilized peptides.
We compared the residue flexibility (as reflected by the B-factor values) of the clustroid structure
of Ensemble 220 (Figure 4B) and the individual residue dynamics captured by the first dominant
principal component (Figure 4C). The B-factor values of 4BW1_A suggest high flexibility of the loop
BC, but the flexibility of loop ZA is only slightly higher yet comparable to the several residues of
helices ჴZ and ჴC. However, the residue dynamics captured by the first principal component of

740

Multiple structural clustering of bromodomains of the BET proteins

Lukman et al.

multiple structures in Ensemble 220, highlights that the loop ZA is the most flexible region within the
BET bromodomain. The flexibility of the loop BC is comparable to that of loop AB. Moreover, the
conserved helices ჴZ, ჴA, ჴB and ჴC are relatively invariant in position, suggesting their roles in
preserving the structural fold.
To examine the Kac binding pocket in more details, we calculated pocket RMSDs of all structures
in Ensemble 220. To define the residues forming the Kac binding pocket, we could examine residues
around the small molecules, which bind to bromodomains present in Ensemble 220 and selected a
union of all identified residues. For example, residues W81-F83, Q85, V87, L92, L94, Y97, C136,
Y139, N140, D145, I146 and V149 of human BRD4 are within 5 Å from the small molecule S5B,
which was resolved in a complex with the centroid structure of Ensemble 220. An exhaustive way is
to include all residues forming the loops ZA and BC as residues that define Kac binding site for the
pocket RMSDs calculations. Using the exhaustive method, for all the pairwise pocket RMSDs within
Ensemble 220, the median and mean values are 0.477 Å and 0.507±0.201 Å, respectively. The
maximum pocket RMSD is 1.212 Å between the 4th NMR model of PDB entry 2L5E (a mouse
BRD3) and 2DVS_C (a human BRD2).
We plotted the clustering heat map of pocket RMSDs (Figure 2C) and it appears that higher
number of clusters (than all-residue pairwise RMSDs) is evident in terms of subtle structural diversity.
By setting the number of cluster to eight, as implied by the distinct boxes along the heat map diagonal,
we identified a representative structure for each cluster based on pocket RMSDs. The representative
structures include 4A9E_B (a human BRD2), 4UYH_C (a human BRD2), 2L5E08 (a mouse BRD3),
4O7A_A (a human BRD4), 4HXS_A (a human BRD4), 2YW504 (a human BRD3), 4O76_A (a
human BRD4), and 4KCX_A (a human BRDT). The representative structures can then be used as
initial structures for systematic classification of specific ligands of bromodomains (which is lacking
hitherto [4]), molecular dynamics simulations (to enhance the conformational space being sampled)
[26], identification of allosteric sites through fragment mapping [27], normal mode analysis [28], or
virtual screening based on ensemble docking.
The acetylation of lysine residue residues neutralizes the positive charge of the primary amine.
Consequently, the acetylated lysine binding sites on bromodomains must be predominantly
hydrophobic and deep, to accommodate the acetylated lysine. Such binding sites are attractive pockets
where competitive inhibitors of Kac, such as Kac mimetic inhibitors, can bind to and block the
recognition of Kac on histone or non-histone proteins. Hydrophobicity, electrostatic properties,
network of hydrogen bonds, network of water molecules [29], dynamical volume size and surface
areas of the binding pocket must be considered in the efforts of drug design, to achieve higher
specificity and selectivity with minimal side effects. For example, the conserved asparagine (residue
N156 in human BRD2, N116 in human BRD3, N140 in human BRD4 and N109 in human BRDT)
forms a hydrogen bond with the natural ligand Kac [30], hence the competitive inhibitors can be
designed to better utilize this hydrogen bond for anchoring to the Kac binding pocket. Electrostatic
attractions of the region surrounding the Kac binding pocket have been reported to influence the
affinity of the bromodomain of Fetal Alzheimer antigen (FALZ) for its binding partner histone H4 [5].
Potential allosteric sites that regulate the Kac binding pocket through correlated motions and are
present only transiently or in a specific member of BET proteins, might also be identified as
performed on other proteins such as Ras for lead generation [31]. Unlike the Kac binding pocket that
must preserve its predominantly hydrophobic residues to accommodate Kac, allosteric sites are under
less evolutionary pressure to remain conserved.

3.4 Non-negative matrix factorization shows similar clustering results
as PCA does.
To further unravel the relationships among the bromodomain structures in Ensemble 220 in terms
of structural dynamics, we performed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to obtain structural

741

Multiple structural clustering of bromodomains of the BET proteins

Lukman et al.

clusters of BET proteins (Figure 5) by accounting for parts-based representations, which might have
been missed in PCA. NMF is a popular method for image analyses (e.g. facial pattern recognition) and
text mining / natural language processing [21]. In the field of computational biology, NMF has been
successfully applied to compare and predict classes in microarray data, to discover molecular pattern,
to functionally characterize genes [22], to predict protein-protein interactions using NMF-based matrix
completion method [32]. Efforts to popularize the NMF method in analyzing biological data also
include the developments of LS-NMF [33] and bioNMF [20]. These two methods are mainly for gene
expression / microarray data analyses, for example to link functionally related genes. In this study, we
have shown that NMF is also useful to cluster multiple protein structures.

Figure 5: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) analysis of BRD2 (magenta), BRD3 (cyan) BRD4 (black),
BRDT (brown) structures within Ensemble 220. The x and y axes correspond to two respective columns of matrix
W. NMR structures are labeled with x. Mouse structures are labeled with inverted triangles.

Factors 1 and 3 separate NMR and crystallographic structures. Several panels (including those
between Factors 2 and 3, Factors 2 and 4, Factors 3 and 4) clearly separate mouse BRD3 structures
from other structures. Factors 2 and 4 also distinguish BRD2 and BRD4 structures, with minor
overlaps. In overall, NMF results are similar to the PCA ones, yet NMF is able to capture some subtle
relationships not obvious in PCA. For example, in the panel between Factors 3 and 4, the human
BRDT structures from the PDB entry 2RFJ appear to be closer (in terms of structural similarity) to the
largest cluster containing BRD2 and BRD4 structures, than the mouse BRD3 structures do.

4 Conclusion
We have identified subtle differences in the structural dynamics of BET proteins that might have
non-subtle functional effects. For future studies, we plan to perform large-scale virtual screening using
National Cancer Institute and ZINC compound libraries against the representative structures identified

in this study and cell-based assays to verify the screening results. Future availability of more structures
facilitated by methods such as high throughput crystallography, will mutually benefit our current and
other approaches [34] to assign cluster-based functional annotations and recommend strategies for
developing therapeutic agents targeting bromodomains.
