Abstract
In this paper, we introduce an approximate approach to public service system design making
use of a universal IP-solver. The solved problem consists in minimization of the total discomfort of system users, which is usually proportional to the sum of demand-weighted distances
between users and the nearest source of provided service. Presented approach is based on radial formulation. The disutility values are estimated by some upper and lower bounds given by
so-called dividing points. Deployment of dividing points inﬂuences the solution accuracy. The
process of the dividing point deployment is based on the idea that some disutility values can
be considered relevant and are expected to obtain in the optimal solution. Hereby, we study
various approaches to the relevance with their impact on the accuracy and computational time.
Keywords: weighted p-median problem, approximate covering model, disutility relevance estimation

Introduction

Designers of large public service systems must often face two opposing requests. The ﬁrst one
requires the service center deployment to minimize some form of disutility of the system users.
The second request concerns keeping deadline of the design submission. To comply with both
requests, some optimization tool is needed to avoid long term software development. Unfortunately, available IP-solvers are mostly universal to solve general integer programming problems,
but the universality is paid by their inability to solve special large location problems. As just
solving of the large location problems forms the background of public service system designing,
we focused on evolving such approach, which is able to overcome the above mentioned drawback
of the universal IP-solvers. Designing of public service system includes determination of center
locations, from which the associated service is distributed to all users of the system [2], [4],

[10]. The number of service centers must be limited due to economic and technological reasons
[9], [12]. Thus the public service system structure is formed by deployment of limited number
of service centers and the associated objective in the standard formulation is to minimize the
social costs, which are proportional to the distances from users to the nearest service centers.
The social costs can be denoted as a disutility, to which a system user is exposed. In other
words, the standard approach to the public service system design assumes that the user is served
from the nearest located service center or from the center, which oﬀers the smallest disutility to
the user. This way the associated mathematical model takes the form of a weighted p-median
problem, where the numbers of served users and possible service center locations may take the
value of several thousands. The necessity of solving large instances has led to the approximate
approach, which enables to solve large instances of the problem in admissible time [1], [3]. The
approximate approach [5], [6], [11] developed for solving the p-median problem is based on
minimization of an upper bound of the original objective function.
The remainder of this contribution is organized as follows: The radial formulation of the
weighted p-median problem is described in the next Section. Section 3 introduces the process of dividing point determination using the disutility relevance. Our suggestions of various
disutility relevance models are discussed in Section 4. The computational study is presented
in Section 5 together with partial recommendation to convenient parameter adjustment. To
conclude, we summarize our ﬁndings in Section 6.

Radial formulation of the problem

The public service system design with minimal total disutility is a task of location of at most
p service centers so that the sum of individual disutilities of each user coming from the nearest
located service center is minimal. This problem is often referred as the weighted p-median
problem. To describe the problem, we denote I a set of possible service center locations and J
the set of possible users locations. The symbol bj denotes the number of users located at the
location j. Disutility for a user at the location j coming from the possible center location i is
denoted as dij . Under these assumptions, we can state the problem as follows:
⎧
⎫
⎨
⎬
M inimize
bj min{dij : i ∈ I1 } : I1 ⊂ I, |I1 | ≤ p
(1)
⎩
⎭
j∈J

The symbol I1 denotes a subset of the set I of all possible service center locations. The
problem (1) is known as the weighted p-median problem, which is broadly discussed in [1], [3],
[5], [6] from the viewpoint of solving techniques for huge instances. Within this paper, we focus
on so-called radial formulation used in the above papers, but on the contrary to other authors,
we make use of homogenous system of radii, construction of which is based on the set of dividing
points. The strategic decision in the problem (1) concerns location of centers at possible center
locations from the set I. To model this decision at location i, we introduce a zero-one variable
yi ∈ {0, 1}, which takes the value of 1, if a center should be located at this location, and it
takes the value of 0 otherwise. To obtain an upper or a lower bound of the original objective
function, the range [d0 , dm ] of all m + 1 possible disutilities d0 < d1 < · · · < dm from the matrix
{dij } is partitioned into r + 1 zones. The zones are separated by a ﬁnite ascending sequence of
so-called dividing points D1 , D2 , . . . , Dr chosen from the sequence d0 < d1 < · · · < dm , where
0 = d0 = D0 < D1 and also Dr < Dr+1 = dm . The zone s corresponds with the interval
(Ds , Ds+1 ]. The width of the s-th zone is denoted by es for s = 0, . . . , r. In addition, auxiliary
zero-one variables xjs for s = 0, . . . , r are introduced. The variable xjs takes the value of 1, if
2278

the disutility of the user at j ∈ J from the nearest located center is greater than Ds and it takes
the value of 0 otherwise. Then the expression e0 xj0 + e1 xj1 + · · · + er xjr constitutes an upper
approximation of the disutility dj∗ from user location j to the nearest located service center.
If the disutility dj∗ belongs to the interval (Ds , Ds+1 ], then the value of Ds+1 is the upper
estimation of dj∗ with the maximal possible deviation es . We note that the lower bound of the
disutility dj∗ can be expressed as e0 xj1 + e1 xj2 + · · · + er−1 xjr . Let us introduce a zero-one
constant asij for each triple [i, j, s] ∈ I × J × {0, . . . , r}, which is equal to 1, if the disutility dij
between the user location j and the possible center location i is less or equal to Ds , otherwise
asij = 0. Then, using the upper bound expression, the radial model can be formulated as follows:

The objective function (2) gives the upper bound of the sum of original disutility values.
The constraints (3) ensure that the variables xjs are allowed to take the value of 0, if there is at
least one center located in radius Ds from the user location j. The constraint (4) puts a limit
p on the number of located facilities.

Disutility relevance for dividing points determination

Deployment of the dividing points inﬂuences the size of the covering model (2) - (6) and the
accuracy of the result. The dividing points can be chosen only from the set of values d0 <
d1 < · · · < dm , where D0 = d0 and Dr+1 = dm . Let the value dh have a frequency Nh of its
occurrence in the matrix {dij }. In the suggested approaches, we start from the hypothesis that
the disutility dh from the sequence d0 < d1 < · · · < dm occurs in the resulting solution nh times
and that is why the deviation of this disutility value from its approximation encumbers the
total deviation proportionally to nh . The disutility d for a user from the nearest located service
center can be only estimated taking into account that it belongs to the interval (Ds , Ds+1 ].
The maximal deviation of the upper estimation Ds+1 from the exact value d is Ds+1 − Ds1 ,
where Ds1 is the minimal element of the sequence d0 < d1 < · · · < dm , which belongs to the
interval (Ds , Ds+1 ]. If we were able to anticipate a frequency nh of each dh in the unknown
optimal solution, we could minimize the total deviation of the upper approximation from the
unknown optimal solution by convenient deployment of dividing points. The dividing points
for the upper approximation follow from the optimal solution of the problem described by (7) (11). If the disutility value dh belongs to the interval ending by the dividing point dt then the
decision variable zht takes the value of 1.

The link-up constraints (8) ensure that the disutility value dh−1 belongs to the interval ending with dt only if each other disutility between dh−1 and dt belongs to this interval. Constraints
(9) assure that each disutility value dh belongs to some interval and the constraint (10) enables
only r dividing points to be chosen. After the problem (7) - (11) is solved, the nonzero values of
ztt indicate the disutility values dt corresponding with dividing points. The associated solving
technique consists of the estimation of the relevance nh , solving the dividing points deployment
problem (7) - (11) and subsequently solving the radial-type weighted covering model (2) - (6).

Models of the disutility relevance

The above approach is obviously based on the ”relevance” of a disutility dh , which expresses
a level of our expectation that the disutility value dh will be a part of the unknown optimal
solution, which is searched for. We suggested and explored several ways of the relevance estimation. In the ﬁrst one, we started with the frequency Nh of dh occurrence in the disutility
matrix {dij } and set the initial relevance at the value nh given by the expression (12), where
T is a positive shaping parameter.
dh

nh = Nh e− T

(12)

The approach (12) follows the hypothesis that the relevance decreases exponentially with
increasing disutility value [6]. The other approach to the relevance described in [8] uses the
column ranking evaluation Lts
j (dij ) of the disutility value dij and the relevance nh is deﬁned
according to (13).
nh = Ltsh =

Lts
j (dij )
j∈J

(13)

i∈I
dij =dh

The linear column ranking function Lts
j (dij ) is deﬁned as follows: Let Pj (dij ) be the position
of dij in the ascending sequence of the j-th column items of the disutility matrix {dij } and let
a denote the cardinality of I. Then Lts
j (dij ) = a + s ∗ (1 − Pj (dij )) for Pj (dij ) < a + 1 − t and
Lts
j (dij ) = 0 otherwise. The parameters t and s represent a threshold and a step respectively.
The threshold inﬂuences the number of t − 1 largest disutility values of the j-th column, which
are not taken into account and the step gives the diﬀerence between the contributions of the
k-th and (k − 1)-th item of the ascending sequence of the j-th column items. The parameter t
can vary over the range [p, a − 1] of integers, and the step s can take values from the interval
[0, a/(a − t)]. This ranking expression of the relevance can be modiﬁed using the exponential
reduction. Then, the associated relevance nh is deﬁned in accordance to (14).

(14)

The last suggested approach to the relevance estimation comes from the exponential approach, but it takes into account that the slope of the exponential function is too steep in the
neighborhood of zero disutility and that the relevant disutility values can be sparsely distributed
in this neighborhood. To avoid the groundless reduction of the relevant disutility values, we
moved the exponential function to the range of biggest disutility values. The shifted exponential approach computes the relevance nh according to (15). The function g(h) is equal to 1 for
each h ≤ hcrit and it is deﬁned by (16) for h > hcrit .
nh = Nh g(h)
g(h) = e−

The constants T and hcrit are parameters of the approach. T is the shaping parameter and
hcrit is the critical value deﬁned by (17) for given value of the parameter q.

Inﬂuence of the above mentioned relevance models on computational time and the deviation
from the optimal objective function was broadly investigated in [7]. The approximate methods
using the relevance models were also compared to the exact approach. Based on the presented
results, it was found that the computational time of the approximate approaches is hundred
times smaller in comparison with the exact method used for bigger problem instances. The
accuracy of the approximate approaches was very good, especially when the shifted exponential
estimation of the disutility relevance was employed. As the shifted exponential estimation of
the disutility relevance seems to be most promising tool for the public service system design,
we concentrate on its next customization and on exploring its characteristics in the following
numerical experiments. As can be easily found from the expressions (15) - (17), the most
promising relevance model depends on the pair of parameters T and q. The parameters were
set at the values 1 and 2 respectively in the computational study published in [7]. That is why
we started with analyzing this choice in the next section with the intention to improve it.

Numerical experiments

We have introduced the approximate covering method for public service system design problem
with the shifted exponential estimation of the disutility relevance. This model of disutility
relevance estimation depends on the pair of parameters T and q. Hereby; we are presenting
the results of numerical experiments, which were aimed at the best setting of the parameters
from the viewpoint of computational time and the solution accuracy expressed by so called
gap. All experiments were performed using the optimization software FICO Xpress 7.5 (64-bit,
release 2013). The associated code was run on a PC equipped with the Intel Core i7 2630
QM processor with the parameters: 2.0 GHz and 8 GB RAM. Particular approaches to the
disutility relevance estimation were tested on the pool of benchmarks, whose size, i.e. the
number of possible service center locations, varied from 300 to 1500 by 200. The number of
user locations of the designed system was the same as the cardinality of the set I. For each
size of the problem, nine instances were solved. These instances diﬀer in the value of parameter
2281

p, which limits the number of located service centers. The value of p was set in such a way,
that the ratio of |I| to p equals 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 respectively. The reported
results are the average values grouped by the ratio of |I| to p. As the system disutility of the
users located at j the network distance between the location and the nearest located service
center was taken. The weight bj of each j ∈ J corresponds with the number of users located
at the location j. Furthermore, we assume that each possible location of a service center has
enough capacity to serve all users. The optimal solution of the problem was obtained by solving
the well-known location-allocation model in the optimization environment Xpress. Since the
covering model provides only the approximation of the former objective function, its real value
must be computed according to the values of location variables yi , i ∈ I and the disutility
matrix {dij }. Mathematical formulation can be expressed by (18).
min{dij : i ∈ I, yi = 1}

(18)

j∈J

In the covering model (2) - (6), the number r of dividing points was set to the value of 20
in all solved instances. The quality of the solution obtained by the covering approach with any
of the disutility relevance estimation is measured by gap, which is deﬁned as follows: Let ES
denote the objective function value of the Exact Solution of the problem and let CS be the
real objective function value of the Covering Solution computed according to (18). The gap
represents the diﬀerence between these values expressed in percentage of the exact solution.
|CS − ES|
∗ 100

Time comparison of the suggested approaches is reported in Table 1, which contains average
computational time in seconds computed of seven diﬀerent instances for each considered ratio
|I|/p and parameter q. It is important to note, that the reported value of the covering approach
includes two optimization processes - dividing points deployment by model (7) - (11) and solving
covering problem (2) - (6). As we can see in the table, the approximate covering method
provides the solution much faster than the exact method. This feature can be considered very
useful mainly in large-scaled weighted p-median instances. Quality of the obtained solutions is
evaluated by gap, which is computed according to the formula (19). Average results of the seven
instances for diﬀerent ratios and values of the parameter q are reported in Table 2 similarly to
the form of Table 1. As concerns the solution accuracy, the experiments have indicated, that
bigger ratio of |I| to p requires bigger value of the parameter q to obtain better solution.
As the dependence of suitable q on the ratio |I|/p is not clear from entries of the Table
2, we traced the number of cases, when the best result of the seven instances for the given
ratio was achieved with the given value of the parameter q. The numbers are plotted in Table
3. It can be seen that the occurrence of the best results are scattered over substantial part
of the individual rows corresponding to the individual values of the ratio. Furthermore, there
are numerous ambiguities especially in the rows, which correspond to lower values of the ratio.
That is why we decided to take into account only the pairs of ratio and parameter values, for
which at least one best result was achieved and the associated gap was less than one percent.
The good results led us to the hypothesis that the convenient value of the parameter q depends
on the ratio |I|/p according to the expression (20), where real constant a may take values from
the interval [0.5, 2].

The hypothesis was tested for several values of the parameter a from the considered interval
to ﬁnd the most suitable setting of the parameter. The results of the experiments are plotted in
Tables 4 and 5, where Table 4 contains average computational times and Table 5 comprises average gaps. The averages are computed from the results of the above mentioned seven instances

As concerns the gaps, our hypothesis was conﬁrmed. In most cases, the gaps stay below
1 percent. Taking into account the average over all tested values of the ratio |I|/p in the
Table 5, we can conclude that the most suitable value of the parameter a is 1 and possible the
neighboring values 0.8 and 1.2, where only in 1 case the average gaps exceed 1 percent. The
best average computational time was achieved for the cases, where a equals 0.6 or 0.8. The next
portion of experiments was aimed at the analysis of sensitivity of the computational time and
gap to T . These experiments were performed for q determined by (20), where the parameter a
was set to the value of 1.

As concerns the gaps, we can conclude that the most suitable value of the parameter T is 1,
when the average over all tested values of the ratio |I|/p in the Table 7 is taken into account.
Analyzing the average computational times from Table 6 we can notice that the best average
computational time was achieved for the cases, where T equals 0.5 or 1.

Conclusions

In this paper an improved shifted exponential approach to the disutility relevance estimation
was introduced. The main contribution consists in analyzing of the dependence of parameter q
on the size of solved problem. The parameter q belongs to the input parameters which need to
be properly set to obtain a solution of good accuracy. We were successful in ﬁnding the dependency of suitable value of mentioned parameter on parameters of the solved problem. We also

examined dependence of result quality on another parameter T and found its most convenient
value. Thus presented approach does not need any ad-hoc settings of input parameters.
