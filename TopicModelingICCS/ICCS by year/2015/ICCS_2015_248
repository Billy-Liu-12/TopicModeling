Abstract
This paper presents a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model used to capture the USD/COP market sentiment dynamics
choosing from uptrend or downtrend latent regimes based on observed feature vector realizations calculated from
transaction prices and wavelet-transformed order book volume dynamics. The HHMM learned a natural switching
buy/uptrend sell/downtrend trading strategy using a training-validation framework over one month of market data.
The model was tested on the following two months, and its performance was reported and compared to results
obtained from randomly classiﬁed market states and a feed-forward Neural Network. This paper also separately
assessed the contribution to the model’s performance of the order book information and the wavelet transformation.
Keywords: Machine Learning, Price Prediction, Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model, Order Book Information,

Introduction.

Learning proﬁtable trading strategies requires the combination of expert knowledge and information
extracted from data. Experts visually detect important patterns in ﬁnancial charts and react accordingly.
For this reason, the combination of a decision-making model and ﬁnancial data should be the base for
building up proﬁtable trading strategies. In this context, this paper presents a trading strategy constructed using an HHMM that represents ﬁnancial market interactions and wavelet-ﬁltered order book
information highlighting the most relevant features.
One of the ﬁrst special cases of DBNs implemented in the price prediction problem were Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs assumed that the underlying modeled system exists in one of a ﬁnite
number of states. The latter states are hidden and are responsible for producing a sequence of observable
variables. Hassan [5] is one of the ﬁrst authors who extracted HMMs from speech and image recognition problems and placed them in the stock price prediction domain.

As a natural extension to an HMM, a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) was also used
to represent ﬁnancial markets and solve price prediction problems. An HHMM is a natural extension
because experts identify different levels of time hierarchy when analyzing ﬁnancial market information.
For example, Jangmin et al. [7] presented a 5-state model that described market trends; strong bear,
weak bear, random walk, weak bull and strong bull market phases. This work reported that the HHMM
outperformed on average a simple buy-and-hold strategy and a trading strategy following a TRIX, a
commonly used technical analysis indicator. HHMMs were also adapted to high-frequency ﬁnancial
data. In Sandoval’s work [9], a 2-state model which captured runs and reversals was coupled with a
second hidden variable layer which produced observable market features. This work implemented an
asynchronous time model and recognized regime changes from uptrend to downtrend time periods. The
input variable set went from historical prices to the ﬁrst 10 orders from the market order book.
The application of DBNs to the price prediction domain is a recently explored study ﬁeld. The main
objective of this work is to assess the contribution of wavelet-transformed order book information to
the design of a proﬁtable trading strategy extending results found in Sandoval [9]. Next section will
present the market information representation. Third and fourth sections discuss dataset, methods and
experiment. Finally, model’s performance and conclusions are provided.

Observed feature vector.

A feature vector was constructed to capture information from two valuable sources; transaction and order book dynamics. Transactions are deﬁned as realized market trades. The order book can be deﬁned
as the group of orders that has not been executed yet but shows agents’ intentions to trade at certain
quantities and prices. This information was used to forecast future trend in ﬁnancial prices because
exact future prices are not needed to create a proﬁtable trading strategy. In the speciﬁc case of the order
book dynamics, several studies had shown that order books have relevant information to improve ﬁnancial price direction prediction [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11]. Therefore, the feature vector will combine elements
from the order book and transaction dynamics.
In order to understand the feature vector characterization, we made several deﬁnitions. Let
{Py }, y ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Y } be a series of market transactions not necessarily homogeneously distributed
in time. Transaction durations have not been taken into account and have been left for future research. Let also deﬁne {Em , Im }, m ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M } as a sequence of local extrema from the series Py at transaction index Im = y, i.e. prices at which the transaction series changes direction.
The index set Im is a strictly increasing series recording positions of extremum transaction prices.
The zig-zag process, {Zx }, was constructed recording differences between n adjacent local extrema as
Zx = Em − Em−n , m ∈ {2n, 3n, . . . , M } and x ∈ {1, 2, . . . , X}. n controls the number of local
extremum price differences accumulated. If Zx ≥ 0, the zig-zag is leading upward or is simply called
positive and if Zx < 0, the zig-zag is leading downward or is simply called negative. If n = 1, we do
not accumulate zig-zags. This cumulative zig-zag is useful to reduce model’s prediction instability.
The zig-zag and the extremum price series are complemented with information extracted from the
order book dynamics. The order book is deﬁned as a 2-dimensional process that describes changes in
limit orders’ volume for different price levels during each observed market event, i.e. order insertion,
modiﬁcation or elimination. The order book series, {By2 } , will be limited to book states when transactions occur. Because of the high sparsity of the order book, price levels are normally expressed as
intervals over the price dimension.

Based on the raw limit order book process, two simple-smoothed exponential distance-weighted
average volume series, SEDW AVxBid , SEDW AVxOf f er , are constructed to capture how volume was
concentrated in the buy and offer sides of the order book for every zig-zag x. These two series corresponded in time with each zig-zag. The closer the volume to the best bid/offer best price, the higher the
weight given to that volume. An exponential average was used to expressed this fact. Formally:

Wavelet transform of the SEDWAV Series. The raw order book series was denoised before calculating the SEDWAV series using a discrete 2D-wavelet transform of the order book process with a
Haar Wavelet over a daily window and a 2-level resolution. The wavelet transform was used to recover
a ﬁltered version of the order book series setting all detail coefﬁcients at the second level in all three
directions, horizontal, vertical and diagonal, to zero. Thus, we expect to capture relevant changes and
leave aside the effect of noisy order book updates. The marginal contribution of the wavelet transform
will be assessed on the validation data set. Figure 1 (Right) shows the denoised version of the order
book information presented in Figure 1 (Left). The wavelet-ﬁltered version of the order book clearly
shows the bid volume block previously observed in the raw order book.
Next, we deﬁned volume blocks as wavelet-transformed SEDWAV values that are greater than a
threshold αV . The same threshold is used for bid and offer SEDWAVs. Accordingly, a discrete feature

where αP is a threshold used to differentiate signiﬁcant transaction price movements.
Figure 3 summarizes feature vector interpretation. The ﬁrst element in the observed feature vector
is the zig-zag type, i.e. maximum or minimum. The second component captures price’s momentum
comparing current maximum or minimum with its recent historical values. Finally, the third element
captures the existence of volume blocks on both sides of the order book. For example, (1, 1, 1) means
a local maximum, with a local uptrend and a volume block on the bid side of the order book. D1:9 are
observations exclusively produced by Q2 (1) and Q2 (4). U1:9 are observations only produced by Q2 (2)
and Q2 (3), see Figure 2. The HHMM’s structure simulates a two-level market in which, ﬁrst, it enters
a market regime and then within each regime, positive and negative features are produced. This structure guaranteed that a positive feature is always followed by a negative featured and vice versa. This
structure summarizes expert trader’s knowledge of how ﬁnancial prices evolve. We expect that U1:4 and
D1:4 features are more probable observed during macro uptrends and U6:9 and D6:9 are more probably
found during macro downtrends. U5 and D5 , deﬁned as no micro trend and no volume block existence
are expected to be associated with no particular market state. These two states will represent what is
commonly known as noise in price movement.
Using the previous model, this paper captured the dynamics of the USD/COP in order to predict its
short-term future behavior. Next section will present the dataset and its characterization.

DataSet

Dataset consisted of three months of tick-by-tick information from the limit order book and transactions
of the USD/COP, the Colombian spot exchange rate starting in March 1, 2012. Data has been extracted
from the Set-FX market, the local interbank FX exchange market. Dataset covered 43,431 transactions.
Transactions with similar time stamp have been aggregated into one observation because it is very likely
that the same agent executed them. Additionally, data included 658,059 order book updates for every
order located 10 pesos above/under the best quoted prices aggregating orders’ volume using 20 cent
intervals. Volume was expressed in 250 thousand US dollar units. Due to liquidity issues, the ﬁrst and
last 10 minutes of the available data were not considered. USD/COP spot interbank exchange market
opens at 8 am and closes at 1 pm. It is a semi-blind market, participants only know their counterparts
after transactions are executed. USD/COP average daily turnover is 1 billion dollars. Figure 1 depicts
the raw and ﬁltered order book dynamics of a particular day.

Methods and Experiment.

Different from other studies [6, 8], the primary goal of this work was to predict market states instead of
raw prices or price levels. Therefore, order book and transaction information series were transformed
into a feature vector realization series. Though, market states were learned following an unsupervised
framework, we expected that during the training phase, the DBN differentiated between two market
regimes latter marked as uptrend or downtrend.
Transaction price and order book information were converted into an observed feature series following section 2. The zig-zag factor agregation, n, was set to 5 so 3 negative and positive basic zig-zags
were aggregated to create unique zig-zags. Each aggregated zig-zag covers, on average, 10 transactions
per observed feature realization. A lower n value would drive to a prohibitively high computational cost
for real implementations. In contrast, a larger n would increase the number of missing entering points
in price trends.
First, this paper explored potential values for price and volume threshold, αV and αP . To guarantee
that every possible feature vector realization was observed during the training set, αV took values between 12 and 18 volume units (3-4.5 million US dollars) and αP took values between 5 and 30 cents.
1597

Parameter values located out of these ranges produced feature vector observations with zero probabilities of occurrence. It is worth it to mention that the αV value range may be inﬂuenced by the 20-cent
volume interval chosen to represent the order book information. The feature vector observation series
was divided into three disjoint sections. The ﬁrst part was used to train the proposed DBN. The second
part was the validation set used to test the model’s generalization ability and to select the best parameter
combination. Finally, the third part of the data was left to test the selected model using information not
provided during the calibration phase. Unfortunately, because data has time structure, it is not possible
to shufﬂe it to repeat the calibration and generalization testing procedure.
Training subset was the ﬁrst 14 days. Validation set was the next 8 days. 38 days were left for
testing the model. First, we used an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to ﬁnd the parameters
that maximized model’s likelihood function over the training set. After obtaining HHMM model’s
parameters, it was found the most probable states of Q11:X variables based on observed evidence over
the training set. This process is known as forward-looking Viterbi inference over observations 1 : X
and it is formally deﬁned as:
arg max P (Q11:X | O1:X ),
(3)
Q11:X

where Q11:X will be the state realizations of Q1 variable during the training data. Learned states of Q11:X
variables were marked as uptrend or downtrend based on the average returns obtained in similar states.

and viceversa. After states Q1 (j), j = 1, 2 were marked as uptrend or downtrend in the training set,
the forward-looking Viterbi inference problem was solved again in the validation set. Then, equation
4 was used to calculate conditional state returns used to compute the trading strategy, buy/uptrend and
sell/downtrend, over the validation set. The validation set was chosen, so it contained roughly two easily
separated up/down macro trends. Return/risk performance based on average over standard deviation of
returns was calculated for each macro trend. Table 1 reports adjusted return/risk (ARR) performance

that the model’s performance is balanced between both up and down macro trends. Small values of
αV and high values of αP produced the poorest performance. The best parameter combination was
αV = 15 and αP = 9. The wavelet transform of the bid and offer SEDWAV series helped to increase
average performance from 0.18 to 0.37 measured using ARR over the validation set. Therefore, from
now on SEDWAV will stands for wavelet-transformed SEDWAV. Standard performance measures were
avoided because when creating a trading strategy based on a market state classiﬁcation, the accuracy
rate, and similar measures do not include the state conditional probability distribution of price movements. Though the mean over the standard deviation of returns calculated using a simulated trading
strategy was selected to consider strategy’s performance adjusted by risk, it is entirely possible to use

another performance measure.
Finally, the selected model was also assessed on the testing set. However, forward-looking Viterbi
inference drives to a non-predictable trading strategy because information indexed x + 1 : X is not
available at the moment we decide to trade. Therefore, when testing model’s prediction ability, we
implemented Viterbi inference without Forward-Looking. Formally, Viterbi inference is deﬁned as,
arg max P (Q1x |O1:x ), x = {1, · · · , X}.
Q1x

(6)

Viterbi inference is much slower than forward-looking Viterbi inference because it implies repeating
the inference process every time a new zig-zag is completed. Equation 4 was recalculated over the testing set and the buy/uptrend and sell/downtrend strategy was also evaluated on the testing set using the
average over the standard deviation of returns. Next section will present unconditional and Q1 state conditional observed feature probability distributions over the training set. We will emphasize the model’s
ability to differentiate between uptrend and downtrend regimes and the possibility of migrating from a
regime identiﬁcation to a proﬁtable trading strategy on the testing set. Model’s performance using the
mean over the standard deviation of returns (without differentiate between macro trends) is reported and
compared to the performance results obtained from a random marking process and a two-layer feedforward neural network (FFNN).

Model Performance and Results.

Unconditional and conditional Q1 probability distributions of observed features calculated over the
training set using the selected model are shown in Figure 4. The ﬁrst relevant observation is that U 5
and D5 are the most common feature categories. This ﬁnding is an expected result because they capture
what it is called noise in price movements, trans- actions that do not have support on price or order book
dynamics. Because Q1 (1) class was marked as an uptrend state (see Table 2 second row), it can be
assessed which features are more frequent in each regime. Speciﬁcally, there is clear evidence to mark
D1, D2, D3, D4, U 1, U 2, U 3 and U 4 as uptrend features and D6, D7, D8, D9, U 6, U 7, U 8 and U 9
as downtrend features. State classiﬁcation perfectly ﬁts what market experts believe based on common
knowledge. Therefore, the market regime probability structure aligned with the traders’ expert knowledge. Afterward, the selected model and the corresponding buy/uptrend, sell/downtrend strategy was
run on the testing dataset using Viterbi inference. As shown in Table 2, left column, returns obtained
from the Q1 (2), the downtrend class are clearly skewed to the negative side. Likewise, returns obtained
from the Q1 (1) class, the uptrend regime, are skewed to the positive side. Moreover, the selected model
also had the ability to ﬁnd two distinct regimes based on comparing mean returns calculated in each
1599

market state. See Table 3, left column, for details. During the testing dataset, selected model ’s total
return was 4.35% and the return/risk performance was 0.1505. The proposed HHMM model was able
to classify two high-frequency market regimes and this classiﬁcation became a proﬁtable trading strategy. Previous ﬁndings do not hold if order book volume information is not considered to construct the
feature vector series. Using the same αP and ignoring volume data in a simpliﬁed feature vector for the
simulated trading experiment, total return decreased to 0.34% driving the return/performance measure
to 0.012. See table 2 and 3, right column.
Random State Marking and feed-forward Neural Network results. Though total return and return/risk performance were positive, there is not a clear benchmark to assess proposed HHMM model’s
results. Therefore, zig-zag feature observations were randomly marked as uptrend or downtrend. Afterward, the buy/uptrend, sell/downtrend strategy was executed. This experiment was repeated 1,000
times. State change probability was set at 10% up to 50% for each experiment. Figure 5, left column,
reported the 95th percentile upper limit of total return and return/risk performance measure calculated
over the testing set. It has to be obvious that it is quite improbable to obtain the selected model’s total
return and return/risk performance value just by chance. However, when order book volume is not considered, it not possible to differentiate between the studied model’s and random picking’s results.
Moreover, a two-layer feed-forward neural network (FFNN) with sigmoid hidden and softmax output neurons was also used to classify future market states based on current and lagged transaction price
and bid and offer SEDWAV series. Because an FFNN’s calibration procedure can be trapped in a local
minimum, network’s parameters were estimated 100 times using different starting values. The 95th percentile upper limit was calculated for the total return and the return/risk performance measure using 2
to 25 neurons in the hidden layer. Though the proposed HHMM model managed zig-zags aggregating a
variable number of transactions and order book volume information, the FFNN can not handle a variable
amount of input data. In order to overcome these limitations, the FFNN was trained using different input
information intervals ranging from 50 to 100 transactions and their corresponding wavelet-transformed
SEDWAV values. On average, the proposed HHMM model aggregated 9.5 transactions per each feature observation and 9 feature observations per each micro trend. Figure 5, right column, summarizes
FFNN-based trading performance results. As shown, the best testing results for the FFNN were obtained
combining 20 neurons in the hidden layer and between 60 and 70 aggregated values in the transaction
and SEDWAV series. However, the 95th percentile upper limit for the total return and the return/risk
performance measure were lower than the ones obtained using the HHMM proposed model. The FFNN
was not able to reproduce the HHMM-based model’s results when using order book volume information.

Conclusion

This work proposed a 2-level HHMM that was converted to a DBN for training and assessment purposes. The proposed model assumed that a particular ﬁnancial market could be viewed as a complex
automaton which enters into two main regimes. Then, each regime cycled through two feature producers, throwing negative and positive observations calculated from transaction and wavelet-transformed
order book volume data. The former model was tested over the USD/COP foreign exchange rate market
using three months of high-frequency data covering transaction prices and tick-by-tick order book information. Data was divided into three groups that represented the training, validation, and testing sets.
After training different models over the training set, the model that showed best generalization abilities
using an adjusted return/risk performance measure over the validation set was selected.

Observed Features

Figure 4: Observed conditional and unconditional probability distribution of observed market features
calculated on the training set using the selected HHMM model. Left: Positive features. Right: Negative
features.

This study used Viterbi inference to classify market regimes between uptrend and downtrend on the
testing dataset. Based on the previous classiﬁcation, the selected model produced a proﬁtable buy/uptrend and sell/downtrend trading strategy that outperformed a simple random state marking process and
a feed-forward neural network. Market regime classiﬁcation ability of selected HHMM model was statistical signiﬁcant. No future information was used during the execution of the studied trading strategy.
