Abstract
This paper is focused on the numerical and computational issues associated to ocean-atmosphere
coupling. It is shown that usual coupling methods do not provide the solution to the correct
problem, but to an approaching one since they are equivalent to performing one single iteration
of an iterative coupling method. The stability analysis of these ad-hoc methods is presented,
and we motivate and propose the adaptation of a Schwarz domain decomposition method to
ocean-atmosphere coupling to obtain a stable and consistent coupling method.
Keywords: Ocean-atmosphere coupling, Schwarz domain decomposition method, air-sea interface

Motivation and problem setting

The use of fully coupled ocean-atmosphere models has become widespread in recent years, in
particular in the context of climate change assessment by IPCC1 experts. Proper representation of air-sea interactions in such models cover a large range of issues: parameterization of
atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers, estimation of air-sea ﬂuxes, time-space numerical
schemes, non conforming grids, coupling algorithms... Several coupling methods, whose precise
contents, theoretical justiﬁcation, and practical performances are often somewhat diﬃcult to
compare precisely, are presently used in actual applications. In this paper we aim at building
a general framework to assess those coupling methods.
The ﬁrst step is to introduce the coupling problem of interest. We symbolically describe
the oceanic and atmospheric circulation models by partial diﬀerential operators Loce and Latm
corresponding to the systems of equations solved by numerical models. The oceanic domain
Ωoce and the atmospheric domain Ωatm have a common interface Γ (the air-sea interface). On

formulation of the problem. Foa is a function allowing the computation of air-sea ﬂuxes. This
function, generally based on the atmospheric surface layer similarity theory [11], depends on
Ua and Uo in the vicinity of the air-sea interface, and on a set of non-turbulent radiative ﬂuxes

of a global weak solution to problem (5) with interface conditions given by a linearized version
of (4) (i.e. with ΔU = vref , and constant values for CD and CH ), considering that Latm and
Loce are the linearized primitive equations of the atmosphere and the ocean.
In this context, the ﬁrst aim of this paper is to provide a tentative classiﬁcation of existing
coupling methods to solve (5) (Sec. 2). Then we discuss the main numerical and physical issues
associated to these methods (Sec. 3), and introduce a framework to cure those issues (Sec. 4).
Some ﬁnal remarks on current and future work are given in Sec. 5.

A classiﬁcation of usual coupling methods

Multiphysics coupling has led to a wide range of mathematical and numerical methods (see [10]
for a review). Usual strategies for ocean-atmosphere coupling can be found for instance in [4]
mostly for long-term integrations, and in [1] and [18] for regional short-term high-resolution
studies. A ﬁrst algorithmic approach is based on the exchange of averaged ﬂuxes between
the models (usually referred to as asynchronous coupling) whereas a second one deals with
instantaneous ﬂuxes (referred to as synchronous coupling). In this section, we expose the key
diﬀerences between the two strategies.

2.1

Asynchronous coupling by time windows (averaged ﬂuxes)

Asynchronous coupling is the strategy used in most climate models of the IPCC. For this
method, the total simulation time [0, T ] is split into M smallest time windows [ti , ti+1 ], i.e.
[0, T ] = ∪M
i=1 [ti , ti+1 ]. The length of those time windows are typically between 2 hours and
1 day depending on applications and on the need to resolve the diurnal cycle. On a given
time window, the models only exchange time-averaged quantities. This has the advantage of
requiring few communications between models and to ensure proper ﬂux conservation. Noting
. i a temporal average over time window [ti , ti+1 ], the coupling algorithm reads
Latm Ua = fatm
Fatm Ua = Foa ( Uo

First the atmospheric model is advanced from ti to ti+1 using the averaged ocean state computed on the previous time window. Then the ﬂuxes used to force the atmospheric model are
averaged and applied to the oceanic model on the same time interval (the ﬂuxes are generally
piecewise constant on each time window). This methodology ensures that over a time interval
[ti , ti+1 ] both models are forced by exactly the same mean ﬂuxes. Indeed, in both models the
2068

time integral of surface ﬂuxes over the simulation equals Fatm Ua [0,T ] . However the solution
of algorithm (6) is not rigorously solution of the original problem (5) because there is a synchronicity issue: the modiﬁcation of the oceanic state Uo on [ti , ti+1 ] is not provided to the
atmospheric component on the proper time interval [ti , ti+1 ] but on [ti+1 , ti+2 ].

2.2

Synchronous coupling at the time-step (instantaneous ﬂuxes)

In the natural world, ocean and atmosphere continuously exchange ﬂuxes on scales ranging from
global to micro scales. Therefore proper coupling frequency between numerical models should
be as small as possible, typically the largest time step between the oceanic and the atmospheric
ones. In this regard, a relevant algorithm would consist in exchanging instantaneous ﬂuxes. If
the oceanic time step Δto is such that Δto = N Δta , the corresponding algorithm reads
Latm Ua
Fatm Ua

=
=

foce
Foa (Uo (ti ), Ua (ti ), R(ti ))

in Ωoce × [ti , ti + Δto ]
on Γ × [ti , ti + Δto ]

(7)

The oceanic and atmospheric components are integrated forward for a time period corresponding to Δto (i.e. N Δta ). Data exchange of instantaneous values is then performed and model
integration continues for another Δto time period . This process is repeated until the ﬁnal simulation time. In (7) the oceanic component receives instantaneous values from the atmosphere
but integrated values can also be considered between ti and ti + N Δta to avoid aliasing errors.
Both choices raise either conservation, aliasing or synchronization problems. In addition, algorithm (7) is diﬃcult to implement eﬃciently from computational and numerical view points.
Code communications are extremely frequent and time integration schemes must be carefully
considered for consistent interfacial conditions. At ﬁrst glance, (7) may appear as a solution
of the full problem (5). This is however formally true only in the limit Δto , Δta → 0. Indeed,
in all numerical models, vertical diﬀusion is treated implicitly-in-time; air-sea ﬂuxes are thus
required at time ti + Δt rather than ti as in (7). Because of this synchronicity issue, we show in
Sec. 3 that the numerical implementation of the synchronous coupling can be unstable. See also
[6] for an analysis of air-sea coupling algorithms in a ﬁnite element framework with Δto = Δta .

Numerical and physical considerations

Usual multiphysics coupling problem generally assume that all scales are resolved by the numerical models. In the case of the ocean-atmosphere problem the presence of physical parameterizations gives rise to physics-dynamics coupling issues. This section is meant to illustrate
the delicacies in the coupling procedure that are speciﬁc to the air-sea coupling problem.

3.1

Physics-dynamics consistency

The computation of air-sea ﬂuxes is based on a parameterization scheme to account for unresolved processes. The ﬂuxes exchanged by the models are thus not the result of a discrete
derivative in the vicinity of the air-sea interface but are given by atmospheric surface layer
parameterizations based on the so-called bulk aerodynamic formulae. Bulk formulations are
symbolically represented as part of the function Foa in (5). They are deﬁned and calibrated
semi-empirically using measurements averaged in time over about one hour or more, and for
2069

Ocean-atmosphere coupling methods

Lemari´e, Blayo and Debreu

a restricted range of stability values [11] (air-sea ﬂuxes are very uncertain under weak and
strong wind conditions). There is little knowledge and observations of air-sea ﬂuxes at high
temporal frequencies (see discussion in [7], Sec. 2) and the sign of air-sea ﬂuxes is uncertain
for time scales less than 10 minutes. In addition, physical processes associated with the wavy
boundary layer which are dominant at high frequency are excluded from the current air-sea ﬂux
estimation schemes used in global and regional climate models. Therefore, we consider mean
hourly ﬂuxes preferable when using bulk formulations (see [11] for a discussion). An internal
time-scale Δtphys is thus assumed for the parameterization to be valid, and Δtphys is generally
larger than the model dynamical time-step Δtdyn 3 . For this reason, a time-averaging procedure
is adopted in algorithm (6). We consider that algorithm (7) is relevant only if physical processes
predominant on short time-scales are explicitly addressed in the ﬂux computation. But such
approaches are under development and are not mature enough to be routinely introduced in
state-of-the-art global and regional climate models.

3.2

Stability analysis of numerical interface conditions

We showed in Sec. 2 that usual coupling methods used in ocean-atmosphere models are not
entirely satisfactory with respect to consistency, conservation or synchronization. We will show
now that, for some parameter values of the vertical parabolic Courant number and vertical resolution, these methods can be numerically unstable. To do so, we consider the one dimensional
diﬀusion problem ⎧

. Each half of the domain Ω = R is solved separately with
ν 2 , z ∈ R+
boundary conditions containing information from the other. Problem (8) is meant to be quite
representative of the vertical turbulent mixing occurring at the air-sea interface. Indeed it is
generally assumed that the turbulent terms w q arising from the Reynolds decomposition can
be parameterized in terms of the resolved quantities q as w q ∼ −ν(z)∂z q (e.g. [17]).
where ν(z) =

Synchronous coupling with classical Dirichlet-Neumann conditions

By analogy to the ocean-atmosphere coupling problem, we consider that the computation in
R+ (i.e. the atmosphere) uses Dirichlet data while the computation in R− (i.e. the ocean) uses
Neumann data. We assume that the coupling algorithm is the synchronous method previously
described and that a backward Euler scheme is used. The corresponding algorithm reads

ﬁnd expressions K± that satisfy the boundary conditions at inﬁnity. Then it can be shown that

each subdomain are integrated using an unconditionally stable time-integration scheme (note
however that inverting the Neumann and Dirichlet conditions would lead to a stable scheme).
Moreover we expect additional stability issues when diﬀerent time-steps are considered in each

Note that in (14), the interface conditions are expressed in term of dynamic viscosity (i.e. the
kinematic viscosity multiplied by density) as in the context of OA coupling, so that we satisfy
the compatibility condition (3). Note also that in (14) the surface boundary condition in the
atmospheric component is assumed to be treated explicitly in time (an implicit treatment would

would impose the atmospheric model to advance ﬁrst from n to n + 1 to provide the ﬂux so
that the oceanic model can be advanced to time n + 1. As in paragraph 3.2.1, let study the
stability by assuming a solution of the form

synchronisation between both models.

Global-in-time Schwarz method

The Schwarz-like domain decomposition methods (see [8] for a review) are widely used for coupling problems with diﬀerent physics and/or diﬀerent numerical treatments. Originally introduced for stationary problems, those methods have been recently extended to time-dependent
problems to provide a global-in-time Schwarz method, a.k.a. Schwarz waveform relaxation (e.g.
[2, 3]). The idea is to separate the original problem on Ω = Ωatm ∪ Ωoce into subproblems
on Ωatm and Ωoce , which can be solved separately. An iterative process is then applied to
achieve convergence to the solution of the original problem. The main drawback of this approach is its iterative nature, which increases the computational cost of coupling, especially
when convergence is slow (note that there is currently an active research aiming at optimizing
the convergence speed of Schwarz-like methods; see discussion in Sec. 5). Using the notations
introduced previously, the iterative algorithm on a time window [ti , ti+1 ] can be written as
follows (for a given initial condition at t = ti ) :
Iterate until convergence
Latm Uak = fatm ,
Fatm Uak = Foa (Uok−1 , Uak , Rk ),
Loce Uok = foce ,
Foce Uok = Fatm Uak ,

in Ωatm × [ti , ti+1 ]
on Γ × [ti , ti+1 ]
in Ωoce × [ti , ti+1 ]
on Γ × [ti , ti+1 ]

(17)

where the subscripts k denote the iteration number. The ﬁrst guess Uok=0 on Γ × [ti , ti+1 ] is
generally taken from the converged solution on the previous time window [ti−1 , ti ]. The two
models, at each iteration, are run successively: this is the so called alternating form of the
algorithm. If the condition Foce Uok = Fatm Uak is replaced by Foce Uok = Fatm Uak−1 both models
can be run in parallel over the whole time window [ti , ti+1 ]: this is the parallel form of the
algorithm. When convergence is reached, this algorithm gives the exact solution to (5). Note
that with algorithm (17) the solution (but not the convergence rate) is independent of the size
of time window [ti , ti+1 ], as opposed to the asynchronous coupling method (due to the fact that
this latter method performs only one iteration of the Schwarz algorithm).
However, for physical constraints on high-frequency treatment mentioned in Sec. 3, algorithm (17) should be modiﬁed to include time-averaging of the quantities near the air-sea
interface as in (6):
Iterate until convergence

(18)

Note that the stability problems mentioned in Sec. 3 are no longer present when using the
Schwarz method because there is no synchronicity problem anymore. Moreover it is also possible to treat implicitly the surface boundary condition in the atmospheric model without
compromising conservation properties. That is why, as will be emphasized in the ﬁnal section,
we think that such a method is a very convenient framework for ocean-atmosphere coupling.

Summary and future work

We have studied in this paper the key role of the coupling algorithm in the design of an
atmospheric and oceanic coupled model. We showed that coupling methods used in regional
and global climate models do not provide the exact solution to the ocean-atmosphere coupling
problem (5), but an approximation. We introduce a natural and non-intrusive method to
handle this problem and we motivate its relevance. This method, called Global-in-Time Schwarz
Method, is based on an iterative process. It can easily be shown that the usual asynchronous
method (6) corresponds to only one iteration of a Schwarz algorithm. Similarly, the synchronous
coupling method (7) corresponds to one iteration of a local-in-time Schwarz algorithm [5] and
can be formally unstable for parameter values typical of ocean-atmosphere coupled simulations.
The fact that this method has an unstable behavior does not necessarily lead to systematic
blowups in realistic models essentially because other processes like diﬀusion and viscosity help
mitigate the problem. We also emphasized the peculiarities of ocean-atmosphere coupling, in
particular the necessary consistency between the physics (i.e. the fact that the parameterization
schemes have their own internal time-scale) and the numerics.
Besides the theoretical work presented in this paper, numerical experiments using a
mesoscale atmospheric model (WRF4 ) coupled with a regional oceanic model (ROMS5 ) for
a realistic simulation of a tropical cyclone have been carried out in [15]. Ensemble simulations
have been designed by perturbations of the coupling frequency and the initial conditions. One
ensemble has been integrated using the Global-in-Time Schwarz Method and an other using
the asynchronous method. The results show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in terms of ensemble spread
(with respect to the cyclone trajectory and intensity), the Schwarz iterative coupling method
leading to a reduced spread. This suggests that part of the model sensitivity to perturbed
parameters can be attributed to inaccuracies in the coupling method. Speciﬁcally, coupling
inconsistencies can spuriously increase the physical stochasticity of simulated atmospheric and
oceanic events (materialized here by the ensemble spread). For our particular case, three iterations of the Schwarz method are suﬃcient to improve the coupled solutions with respect to
the ensemble spread. Additional numerical tests in the coupled LMDZ-NEMO global climate
model (developed at LSCE6 ) are currently under investigation to assess the impact on long-term
simulations.
More generally, it remains to be investigated how robust is the convergence w.r.t. the
model formulation, particularly the boundary layer parameterizations at the air-sea interface.
In this regard, the Schwarz algorithm can also be used as a diagnostic tool to assess consistency
between atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer parameterizations: two schemes could be
recognized as compatible if they lead to a converging Schwarz algorithm. Indeed, if it is not the
case, this would probably highlight a problem in the physical approximations and mathematical
formulation of the models. The building blocks have been recently introduced in [12, 13, 14].
We argue that this work at a fundamental level would be beneﬁcial whatever the coupling
method used in practice. We will also put eﬀort in the near future on the design of idealized
coupled cases to unambiguously assess the beneﬁts of the iterative coupling and some aspects
of the physical suitability of a given parameterization (e.g. by testing the convergence of the
Schwarz approach).
