Abstract
This paper describes an approach for modeling of potentially critical situations in the society. The
modeling approach is proposed to improve the efficiency of the local government management, taking
into account potentially critical situations that may arise on a personal level, social group‚Äôs level and
society as a whole. The use of proposed method is shown by the example of migration policies in St.
Petersburg.
Keywords: modeling, socio-economic development, complex networks, regional management

1 Introduction
In this paper we consider the problem of modeling of potentially critical situations in the migration
policy implementation, caused by difference of migration policies implemented by government and
expected in society, as well as the difference in the perception of migration within the society in order
to enhance management efficiency for the territory development.
Considering the problem of modeling of potential critical situations by the example of migration
policies implementation three components must be taken into account. Firstly, the official position of
State often dictated by the availability of the need to address issues at the regional level. Secondly, the
presence of social groups and communities may lead to alternative views and attitudes towards
migration policy. Third, the existence of a personal attitude of each member of society to the
implementation of the migration policy is determined by their own experience [1].
Image of the ideal scenario for the territory development in the implementation of the migration
policy will be called reference (norm or etalon) scenario associated with reference opinion. Work in
this area have gained particular relevance with the development of Internet technologies as a
communication space, while offering the possibility of "feedback" [2,3].

2 Modeling of potentially critical situations
Modeling of potentially critical situations is considered on three levels: personal, the level of social
groups and society as a whole.
Personal approach involves the study of potential conflicts associated with the difference of the
individual opinions and real life picture. Potentially critical situation arises when an individual's
inability to develop in the desired direction. In the discrete case, each individual can be in one of the
phenomenological states characterized by the studied problem si ( s1 ,..., sn ) . For example: s1 is
very loyal, s 2 is loyal, s3 is neutral, s 4 is negative, s5 is extremely negative. Transitions between
states can be described as a Markov process
(1)
p(si (t )) , ( p1 (t  1),..., pn (t  1)) ( p1 (t ),..., pn (t )) ¬ò P
where pi (t ) is the probability that the individual in a state si at time t , P is the transition matrix

pi (t )

whose elements are the probabilities of transitions between states. At the individual level, the
probability of transition of the individual to the state si can be determined by three factors: U 1 are
the factors of a personal level, which characterize the character of the individual and his environment,,
U 2 are factors of social group level connected with the rules of behavior inside this group, U 3 are
the macro-level factors that characterize the society and the territory as a whole. Thus, in general, the
following equation defines the relationship between the factors

pij (t ) T1,ijU1 (t )  T 2,ijU 2 (t )  T 3,ijU 3 (t )  H ij (t ) .

(2)

Social relations at the individual level play an important role, so society is considered as a graph

–° p which is a set of (V , E ) , where V is a finite set of vertices, and E is a set of edges, consisting
of unordered pairs (ei , e j ) . Vertex of the graph is the corresponding reference (norm) opinion of the

particular person. Edges of the graph are the social relations between individuals. The evolution of
social networks, represented by the graph –° p , can be described with the evolution operator [4].

(V , E, P) t 1

*(V , E, P) t , (V , E, P) t

(V0 , E0 , P) .

* is the operator of the evolution of individual units of time, including components: the emergence of
a new vertex with probability pV (operator *1 ); removal of a vertex with probability qV (operator
*2 ); the emergence of a new edge p E (operator *3 ), due to the occurrence of peaks in the
community or a change in social status; removal of a vertex with probability q E (operator *4 )

Thus, a potentially critical situation at personal level can be represented in the form

X p  Ap , Acp , C p , M p , Dp ! ,

(5)

where Ap is set of unstructured data about the situation, Ac is a set of notions related to A
indirectly, –° p is the social group in society, for which situations X is important. X is described on
personal level with the complex network (4). M is a set of pairs in the form (ai , mi ) , where ai is
an element of the set A , and mi is a characteristic (value) assigned to ai . D defines the reference
opinion about the situation, expressed as a set of pairs (ai , d i ) , where d i is reference value of the
characteristics ai .
M p on a personal level consists of a set of pairs (a ip , m ip ) , where a ip is a characteristic X ,
expressed in a text form, mip is an attitude of an individual to this characteristic. Thus, M p is formed
individually for each person in the society. D p has a similar structure, where d ip is the reference
opinion of each individual about the characteristic a ip .

At the level of social groups the model of reference opinion about regional development strategy
that are specific to some parts of the society is considered. The transition to the next level of social
groups is performed by obtaining the integral characteristics of complex networks –° p and situation
X g <g ( X p ) . Applying the operator which calculates the number of vertices of the given state
\ i \ (si ) to (4) we have

Matrix modeling will be chosen as a methodical basis for the modeling of potential critical
situations. It allows to take into account phenomenological structure of the process using micro-level
modeling. Thus, the value of \ i (t ) can be considered as an element of the matrix constructed as
follows

where J 1 ,..., J n are the attributes of graph vertices. In general form, the matrix (10) may have
arbitrary structure, depending on the semantics of the attributes of vertices J 1 ,..., J n .
Thus, potentially critical situation at the level of social groups is defined as

Thus, the management in the territory development, taking into account potentially critical
situations comes down to a choice and implementation of one of two approaches: strategies to change
the controlling factors U 3 , or change in the reference opinion about the situation for the society
members or social groups by correcting factors by adjusting strategies U 1 and U 2 .
This approach is motivated by the need to reduce or avoid potentially critical situation R (t )

Monitoring unit (M1) is used for the obtaining an accurate description of the situation in the region.
The goal of monitoring is gathering of data for subsequent analysis, forecasting and developing
corrective and preventive actions. Management cycle formed by the unit (M1) provides problem
solving at the level of society D . Methods of control at this level are described in the literature [5].
Problem solving at the level of social groups Dg is achieved by expanding the range of the
analyzed data, in particular sociological surveys (M2).
Problem solving at a personal level D p is provided by the using of semi-structured data gathered
by the unit (M3). This kind of information includes open network data published in Internet social
media, news portals, and forums and so on. Information of this kind allows selecting the local
potential critical situation at a personal level, and thus provides a more delicate regional development
planning.

3 Case studies
The proposed approach is applied to the analysis of migration policies in St. Petersburg and the
identification of possible potentially critical situations.
According to the Federal Migration Service of Russia in St. Petersburg and suburbs national
structure of foreign citizens who have received a work permit includes basically citizens of Central
Asian countries. In St. Petersburg in 2007, there has been a steady increase in crime immigrants (2,325
crimes, 4.2% of the total). Basically this bandit attack on the health of morality. On the other hand the
increase in crime counter foreign citizens 10.5% in the year. According to the survey, almost half of
citizens consider the migration situation tense. At the same time, one of the goal of the state migration
policy is attracting migrants into the regions with workforce deficiency and create jobs in the labor
surplus regions. Such a disparity between public policy and the real situation in the society by the
example of St. Petersburg enables to assume the possible presence of potentially-conflict situations
and, accordingly, the need for their timely detection, localization, and preventive and counter action
with the use of proposed approach based on modeling of different scenarios.

4 Conclusions
The problem considered in the paper is particularly important for areas with high population
density and well-developed communication facilities as the speed of information spreading in society
is one of the key factors in the emergence of various kinds of social protest. Since the idea of reference
opinion is the subjective characteristic of every individual of society, the building of mathematical
models of potentially critical situations should take into account characteristics of social evolution at
micro level. Thus, the cause of potentially critical situations is the fact that it is impossible to achieve
the reference state with accordance to reference opinion for a significant part of society. Future works
will be focused on simulation of social processes (immigration, crime, drug addiction) at the regional
level using proposed approach.
