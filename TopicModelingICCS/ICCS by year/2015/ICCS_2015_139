Abstract
Low-rank matrix estimation plays a key role in many scientiﬁc and engineering tasks, including
collaborative ﬁltering and image denoising. Low-rank procedures are often motivated by the
statistical model where we observe a noisy matrix drawn from some distribution with expectation assumed to have a low-rank representation; the statistical goal is then to recover the signal
from the noisy data. Given this setup, we develop a framework for low-rank matrix estimation
that allows us to transform noise models into regularization schemes via a simple parametric
bootstrap. Eﬀectively, our procedure seeks an autoencoding basis for the observed matrix that
is robust with respect to the speciﬁed noise model. In the simplest case, with an isotropic
noise model, our procedure is equivalent to a classical singular value shrinkage estimator. For
non-isotropic noise models, however, our method does not reduce to singular value shrinkage,
and instead yields new estimators that perform well in experiments. Moreover, by iterating
our stable autoencoding scheme, we can automatically generate low-rank estimates without
specifying the target rank as a tuning parameter.
