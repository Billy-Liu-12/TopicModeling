Abstract
The conventional way of identifying possible motif sequences in a DNA strand is to use representative
scalar weight matrix for searching good match substring alignments. However, this approach, solely
based on match alignment information, is susceptible to a high number of ambiguous sites or false
positives if the motif sequences are not well conserved. A significant amount of time is then required
to verify these sites for the suggested motifs. Hence in this paper, the use of mismatch alignment
information in addition to match alignment information for DNA motif searching is proposed. The
objective is to reduce the number of ambiguous false positives encountered in the DNA motif
searching, thereby making the process more efficient for biologists to use.
Keywords: DNA coding; scoring matrix; sequence analysis

1 Introduction
A DNA strand can be divided into the expressed regions (exons) and intragenic regions (introns).
Exons are the substrings of the DNA sequence that contain information about genes. The introns are
said to contain ‚Äòjunk‚Äô sequences that do not code for any genes. However it is known that introns
contain vital information as tags for ribosomal RNA to identify start and stop transcription sites.
Some examples of this information include binding, donor, acceptor sites and TATA boxes, which are
known as motifs. The motifs that perform the same function, such as binding sites, are highly
conserved and can be represented by a sequence profile or weight matrix. During motif searching, an
alignment score is calculated by adding up the individual score assigned for each position along the
length of the weight matrix. The score for each position is a result of a direct substitution of base type
weightage at position.
The identification of DNA binding sites for transcription factors (motifs) is important for a
complete understanding of co-regulation of gene expression, but still remains to be quite challenging
to achieve. Two approaches dominate motif-finding algorithms: (1) the word-based way [1-3] that
relies on exhaustive enumeration or counting frequencies and (2) the probabilistic way [4-6] that relies
on optimizing a scalar-based scoring matrix [7,8], which is visualized conveniently by a sequence

logo. However, both ways suffer from the problem of producing a high number of spurious sites, due
to the sole consideration of match alignment information.
In this paper, a novel scoring method by introducing the vector representation of DNA sequences
into weight matrix is introduced. In the past, two-, three-dimensional or vector representations of
DNA sequences have been proposed. These representations provide a visual way of classifying genes
and other motifs through DNA walks [9]. In the vector representation of DNA sequences, the four
bases are placed at an equal distance from each other in a three-dimensional space. This is possible by
placing each point on the vertex of a tetrahedron. Any point within the tetrahedron represents the
different combinations of each base type. Therefore the weight distribution for each position can be
replaced a point in the tetrahedron in space using a three-dimensional coordinate. This point is unique
for the different weightage distributions of the bases. The advantages of this method are twofold:
First, instead of using four numbers to represent the weightage distribution at each position, this can
be reduced to three in terms of the three-dimensional coordinate; Secondly, the use of mathematical
operators, namely the dot and cross products, can be adopted to describe the weightage distribution in
the three-dimensional coordinate and served as the basis of measuring the quantity of match and
mismatch alignment information for each alignment position.
A case study of identifying binding sites shows that, by using mismatch alignment information, a
substring with the best alignment can be selected from a group of ambiguous ones and the number of
false positives can be filtered down.

2 Methods
2.1 Scalar Representation of DNA Base Code
In scalar scoring scheme, each base (A, T, G and C) of a DNA sequence is represented by a set of
numbers, such as 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . The problem with this representation is that of unequal weightage
assigned to each base [10]. In order to assign the same weightage for each base, an indicator sequence
using binary numbers was proposed [11]. However, DNA base coded using binary numbers are not
suitable for comparing sequences. Complex and hypercomplex numbers have then been proposed as a
better representation utilizing imaginary domain [12,13].

2.2 Vector Representation of DNA Base Code
The coordinates that are selected for vector representation are shown in Figure 1 [11]. The four
bases are represented by A, T, G and C with O being the origin. The significance of the point O is
such that the distance from each of the vertex is equal to 1 , OA OT OG OC 1 .

2.4 Scalar Scoring ‚Äì Match Alignment Information
The distance between two points in the vector weight matrix represents the degree of the similarity
between them. The nearer are two points, the better is the match. This can be computed by using the
dot product. For the given coordinates xns , yns , zns of a DNA substring and xnm , y nm , z nm of a motif at
the position n with the same length N , match alignment information is the value of the dot product
of their coordinates as follows:

The resultant dot product gives a scalar. The larger the number, the greater the similarity between the
DNA substring and the motif.

2.5 Vector Scoring ‚Äì Mismatch Alignment Information
In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to analyze the type of mismatch contributing to the
lower match alignment information. It can be used to decide whether one site has a greater chance of
containing the motif over the others although they may have the same match alignment information.
Mismatch alignment information can generally be classified into three types. They are transitional,
complementary and transversal mismatches.

2.5.1 Types of Mismatch
Among the four bases forming the skeleton of a DNA sequence, purine bases A and G are bigger
in size as compared with pyrimidine bases T and C. A bigger base pairs up with a smaller base in a
manner of A to T and G to C in DNA. Transitional mismatch occurs when one base is replaced by
another with the same size, i.e., A by G or C by T and vice versa. Because the replacement is of the
same size, the DNA structure is not unduly affected. Hence, transitional mismatch is considered
relatively acceptable.
On the other hand, when one base is replaced by another with a different size but pairs up in DNA,
complementary mismatch occurs, i.e., A by T or G by C and vice versa.
The third kind of mismatch occurs when one base is replaced by another with a different size and
does not pair up in DNA. Among three types of mismatch, this type is considered the most significant
and is known as transversal mismatch, i.e., A by C or T by G and vice versa. An alignment with a
high number of transversal mismatches generally does not contain motif.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Case Study of TATA Box in Homo Sapiens H4/g Gene
A TATA box is a DNA sequence found in the promoter region of most genes in eukaryotes. It is
the binding site of either transcription factor or histone, and involved in the process of transcription by
RNA polymerase. Histone acts as a spool around which DNA winds and there are five major families,
namely H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. H1 is known as the linker histone, while H2A, H2B, H3 and H4
are known as the core histones. They are involved in the different stages of DNA packing. In this
case study, it is interesting to identify TATA box in Homo sapiens H4/g gene. The H4/g gene is
responsible for producing H4 histone. By identifying the TATA box, it is possible to study the
regulation of H4 histone production during DNA packing. Here, a TATA box weight matrix is
generated from RNA polymerase II promoter regions [14] as shown in Table 2.

Based on the TATA box weight matrix in Table 2, the TATA box vector weight matrix is used to
identify possible sites containing the motif within H4/g gene. The vector weight matrix is aligned
with H4/g gene sequence base by base until the last base. For each alignment, match alignment
information is calculated and plotted in Figure 2.

3.2 Results
The plot composed of peaks and troughs. Each peak represents a local high similarity between the
TATA box vector weight matrix and the regions within H4/g gene, and vice versa for troughs. There
are two highly possible sites (positions 185 and 381 in the gene) at which the TATA box could be
situated. However, it is not clear which is the real TATA box since both have the same score. In
order to distinguish these two sites, mismatch alignment information should be used.

3.3 Discussion
Mismatch alignment information as discussed is classified into three categories: transition,
complement and transversion. Among these three types of mismatches, transitional mismatch is
considered the most acceptable. If a base type A is replaced by G or vice versa, it is deemed to have
less effect on the process of transcription. This is because both base types have the same size.
However, if a different size base type C replaces base type A in transversal mismatch, the degree of
mismatch is greater than that of transitional one. Standing in between is complementary mismatch,
although bases A and T may have a different size, they bind to each other in a DNA chain. Given
607

IdentiÔ¨Åcation of DNA Motif with Mutation

these three classes of mismatch alignment information, transitional mismatch is the most acceptable.
This is followed by complementary mismatch and the least acceptable transversal mismatch.
A comparison of transitional mismatch alignment information shows that they are the same for
both predicted TATA boxes. It is still not possible to differentiate the dissimilarity between these two
sites. Hence complementary mismatch alignment information should be considered. Figure 3 shows
that the motif at the site 185 has higher complementary mismatch alignment information as compared
with the motif at the site 381 . This implies that a base A is replaced by a base T, as well as G by C
more often in motif at the site 185 . Hence the more acceptable mismatch, complementary mismatch,
occurs more often at the site 185 . Since the TATA box consists of a string of A and T bases, the
complementary mismatch between A and T is unlikely to affect the function of the TATA box as a
signal for transcription process. Therefore by using the complementary mismatch alignment
information, the site 185 is the more likely site for the TATA box in H4/g gene.

4 Conclusion
DNA contains important motifs, such as binding sites. More often than not, the motifs are not
exact. A weight matrix is the useful way of representing an alignment and also used as a scoring

means to predict motif sites. However by using match alignment information alone, there may be too
many falsely predicted sites, especially for motif sequences that are less conserved. In order to reduce
the number of false positives, the mismatch component of the alignment is considered. The vector
weight matrix can be used to elaborate match and mismatch alignment information: the degree of
match from the dot product and the degree of mismatch from the cross product. Using mismatch
alignment information, the number of false positives can be reduced and the efficiency in identifying
motif can be improved [15].
