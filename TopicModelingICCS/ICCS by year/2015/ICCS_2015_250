Abstract
Distributed generation resources (DGs) and their utilization in large-scale power systems are attracting
more and more utilities as they are becoming more qualitatively reliable and economically viable.
However, uncertainties in power generation from DGs and fluctuations in load demand must be
considered when determining the optimal operation plan for a microgrid. In this context, a novel
dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS) approach is proposed for determining the realtime operation plan of an electric microgrid while considering its conflicting objectives. In particular,
the proposed approach is equipped with three modules: 1) a database including the real-time microgrid
topology data (i.e., power demand, market price for electricity, etc.) and the data for environmental
factors (i.e., solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, etc.); 2) a simulation, in which operation of the
microgrid is simulated with embedded rule-based scale identification procedures; and 3) a multiobjective optimization module which finds the near-optimal operation plan in terms of minimum
operating cost and minimum emission using a particle-filtering based algorithm. The complexity of the
optimization depends on the scale of the problem identified from the simulation module. The results
obtained from the optimization module are sent back to the microgrid system to enhance its operation.
The experiments conducted in this study demonstrate the power of the proposed approach in real-time
assessment and control of operation in microgrids.

1 Introduction
Distributed generation (DG), also known as on-site generation, refers to the production of electricity at
or near the place of consumption using smaller-scale power generation resources and technologies.
Based on this definition, a microgrid (MG) can be considered as a DG-based grid, which can operate
in either islanded or utility grid connected modes. In the islanded mode, it is only the DGs that work to
generate the power and satisfy the demand of the entire microgrid, whereas in the connected mode, the
microgrid may utilize the electricity that is bought from the main grid as well as the one generated via
its own DGs. Microgrids coordinate distributed generation resources in a more decentralized yet
consistent way reducing the control burden on the grid and permit them to provide their full benefits

(Sfikas et al., 2014). However, increasing penetration level of the distributed generation in a microgrid
may increase security risks and cause faults in the energy system. Extreme conditions as well as issues
with voltage violations, power losses, power quality, and reliability (Ackermann and Knyazkin, 2002)
may occur unpredictably. Moreover, one of the main challenges of operating a microgrid is associated
with the fluctuations of load demand and the power generated from the DGs, which may significantly
rely on the weather conditions. These issues make the management of the microgrid in terms of the
operation and planning difficult. From this point of view, a microgrid that can mitigate these
fluctuations and operate in the most cost-effective manner is a necessary. To this end, in this study, a
novel dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS) approach is proposed for determining the
real-time operation plan for an electric microgrid. The proposed DDDAS approach entails the ability
to dynamically incorporate data into an executing application simulation, and in reverse, the ability of
applications to dynamically steer the measurement process, motivated by the DDDAS paradigm that
was first presented by Darema (2000). Since its introduction, the DDDAS paradigm has been
successfully applied to a variety of areas, such as supply chain system (Celik et al., 2010), waste
management (Parashar et al., 2006), medical service (Gaynor et al., 2005), amongst many others.
Electric power distribution networks, more specifically the microgrids, are one of the challenging
application areas to make use of the decidedly effective measurement and control processes available
by utilizing DDDAS modeling techniques (Thanos et al., 2014).
To this end, our proposed approach is equipped with a database, an agent-based simulation model
embedding a rule-based scale identification procedure, and a multi-objective optimization module. In
the database, data related to the MG topology (i.e., real-time load demand, electricity price from the
utility market, etc.), as well as those obtained from the environmental sensors (i.e., solar radiation,
wind speed, etc.) are stored. Upon the initialization of the simulation, the necessary first set of data is
retrieved from the database, and more data is retrieved as the simulation progresses. In the simulation,
the operation of the considered microgrid is simulated under various system uncertainties on an hourly
basis. Meanwhile, a rule-based scale identification procedure is carried out, through which the
complexity of the optimization problem is determined. Once the size of the problem is determined, the
optimization module is executed to obtain the optimal operation plan for the microgrid in terms of the
minimum operating cost and emissions. In order to solve the optimization problem, a novel particle
filtering-based multi-objective optimization algorithm for operation planning of MG is proposed. The
results of the optimization module are finally sent back to the MG system for execution. The
performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via a synthetic microgrid. The approach has
been constructed in a generic manner so that it can be employed by any MG system that has similar
types of DGs by importing the necessary data capturing its characteristics (i.e. number of DGs
installed), topology, and environmental conditions into the database.

2 Proposed Approach
In this study, our goal is to determine the optimal hourly-based operation plan for a microgrid,
whose load demand is satisfied with minimum operating cost and emissions. The components of our
proposed approach are presented in detail in this section (see Figure 1 for overview).

2.1 Database
For easy adaptation of the proposed approach to varying types of microgrids with different
characteristics, the heterogeneous data associated with the considered MG’s topology, operations, and
environment are stored in a database. The environmental data (i.e., wind speed, solar irradiance,
temperature, etc.) is stored to estimate of the amount of electricity that can be generated from the
renewable generation sources including the wind turbines and the solar panels. In the literature, several

studies (i.e., Atwa et al., 2010; Arefifar et al., 2012) have used data that is generated using Weilbull
probability density function (pdf) for wind speed and Beta pdf for solar data. In this study, rather than
these synthetic functions, we incorporate a real-world sensory data for the wind speed, ambient
temperature, and solar irradiance recorded at the Live Oak Station in Florida in 2010. These data are
obtained from the Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN) subsidiary of University of Florida
(FAWN, 2013). The database also contains the microgrid topology data (i.e., load demand, market
energy price, etc.) and the operational data for the distributed generators that characterize the load
demand and operating cost of various DGs.

An agent-based simulation model provides an accurate representation of the considered microgrid
while simultaneously capturing the behavior of operating components as well as their interactions with
each other. In this study, the operating components including demand, solar panels, wind turbines,
biomass generators, and combined cycle generators are designed as the agents.

Biomass Generators Agent. Unlike the solar and wind, biomass is classified as base load
controllable energy generation sources as it is not affected by environmental conditions. In this study,
we use lower bound and upper bound in biomass modelling, as shown in (7), where ܲ௕௜௢ǡ௢௨௧ represents
the amount of electricity produced from biomass generators. While lower bound (LB) satisfies to
produce electricity smoothly, upper bound ensures that the energy generation does not excess the
capacity of generator. In this study, the lower bound is assumed to be 20 percent of the biomass
generator’s capacity, and the upper bound is chosen as the 90 percent of the capacity.

Combined Cycle (CC) Generators Agent. Power generated from combined cycle generators is
controllable on an hourly basis, as it presents desirable operational characteristics (i.e., wide range of
operation hours, ease of operation setting up and shutting down, etc.). Moreover, they are not affected
by external environmental conditions. To this end, in this study, the agent of combined cycle
generators is modeled as a stand-by system that activates automatically when all other DGs fail to
satisfy the total load demands. In this work, natural gas, fuel oil and propane are considered as fuels
that are used in the combined cycle generators.

2.2.2. Scale Identification Scheme
In order to save computational resources and improve the efficiency in the decision making
procedure, thereby to realize the real-time assessment and control of operation in a microgrid, a scale
identification scheme is designed and incorporated in the simulation module for determining model
fidelity within the optimization model, which then impacts the size of the considered optimization
problem. Specifically, given the real-time MG load demand and DG generation capacities, the scales
are determined based on rules shown in the following figure, where ‫ܦ‬௛ represents the power demand
in the microgrid at time ݄. Notations of the other parameters have been described in Section 2.2.1.

For the small scale optimization problem (Scale 1), since the power generated from the solar
panels, wind turbines, and biomass generators (with minimum generation capacity) can satisfy the
demand in the entire microgrid, the combined cycle generators are not included in the optimization
model. Moreover, there is no need to buy electricity from the main grid and the MG may sell the
excess power to the market. For the medium scale optimization problem (Scale 2), two decision
variables, which are the amount of electricity bought from the main grid and the amount of electricity
generated from the biomass generators are added in the optimization model developed for Scale 1, so
are the corresponding constraints. Scale 3 is the most complex one, under which the demand in the
microgrid cannot be satisfied by the “green” distributed generation resources and the biomass
generators. Therefore, the combined cycle generators, which are more expensive and less
environmental friendly, have to be considered. As a result, decision variables that represent the
amount of electricity generated from combined cycle generators at time ݄ and corresponding
constraints are added into the optimization model developed for Scale 2.

2.3 Particle Filtering-based Optimization
In this study, the optimization is executed based on the identified scales to determine the operation
plan for the microgrid in terms of the minimum cost and emissions in any particular hour. These
multi-scale problems are solved via a proposed particle filtering-based optimization algorithm.

2.3.1. Formulation of the Optimization Problem
Identification of the appropriate scales forms the basis for the optimization problems. Optimization
is not required for Scale 1 since the demand can be 100% satisfied by the electricity generated from
“green” DGs. Optimization is straightforward for the Scale 2 problem as well, in which only the
minimization of the cost objective is considered. The formula to calculate the operating cost of the
microgrid under Scale 1 is shown in (8), and the objective function and constraints for the
optimization problem under Scale 2 are presented in (9)–(11). Here, ‫ݒ‬௕ and ݂௕ are the variable
operating and maintenance (O&M) cost and the fuel cost of the biomass generators. Decision variables

2.3.2. Implementation of the Optimization Algorithm
In this work, a particle filtering-based optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the
aforementioned optimization problems. Particle filtering (PF) is a class of importance sampling and
resampling methods applied for simulating the posterior probability distributions in Bayesian
estimation problems (Shi and Celik, 2012). It is introduced by Gordon et al. (1993), and has gained
popularity in recent years due to its advancements (i.e., flexibility, ease of implementation, capability
of dealing with massive dataset, etc.) on a wide range of challenging applications.
The analogy of the proposed PF-based optimization algorithm to those of population-based
optimization methods can be summarized as the following. First, the particles drawn from the
distribution functions behave as if they are the candidate solutions generated from the solution space.
Second, the importance weights assigned to these particles are then considered as the evaluation of the
performances of the generated solutions. Last but not least, the sampling and resampling procedures in
the PF algorithm are similar to the searching and updating procedures in the population-based
optimization methods. To this end, we represent the optimization problem using a state-space model,
in which the optimal solution is treated as a posterior state that is yet to be “estimated”, and the
optimal objective values observed are specified as an ݊-dimension measurements. The state-space
model can be formulated mathematically as shown in (17)-(19), where ‫ݔ‬Ԧ௞ represents the state vector
ሬԦ௞ is the

The algorithm is mainly structured with an adaptive weighted allocation (AWA) procedure and a

distributing the weights of multiple objectives gradually and periodically. In the PSR procedure, the
optima is achieved an alternative is selected amongst all the possible solutions. The probability that
the selected alternative is truly the “best”, is controlled in each iteration. For ease of presentation, let
us take a bi-objective minimization problem as an example here to explain the implementation of these
two procedures. At the initialization step, ܰ particles are randomly drawn within the solution space
and equal importance weights ‫ݓ‬ଵ௜ ൌ ͳȀܰ ( ݅ ൌ ͳǡʹǡ ǥ ǡ ܰሻ are assigned to them. As the iteration
progresses, particles are drawn from the transition prior (i.e., (17)), and the objective weights are
generated via the AWA procedure, as provided in (20)-(21), where ȁήȁ provides the absolute value, ‫ܣ‬
is equal to ͲǤͻͻ and ߝ is ͳͲିହ . These are parameters that are enforced to avoid extreme situations in
which the importance factors of the objectives ሺܱଵ and ܱଶ ሻ are equal to 1 or 0. The frequency of
variation is controlled by the user-defined parameter ܳ, using which the AWA is able to approach the
Pareto front dynamically as the number of iterations increases.

generated by adding a process noise to those particles with large importance weights (i.e., the
transition prior). After several iterations, a mutation step will be triggered to break the local optima, in
which an entire new set of particles will be randomly drawn. As the iterations progress, a set of
promising solutions will be finally obtained. Figure 3 provides a visualized diagram of the PSR

3 Experiments and Results
In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach, experiments are designed and
carried out over a synthetic microgrid that is composed of 346 buildings (demand agents), 5 solar
panels, 3 wind turbines, 2 biomass generators, and 3 combined cycle generators. Table 3 presents the
operating costs for each type of DG resources. The variable O&M cost data are obtained from the

report of NREL in 2010 (Tidball et al., 2010). The fuel cost and carbon dioxide emission data is
reported by Energy Information Administration (2013) and Green Econometrics (2007). The carbon
dioxide emission of the fuel oil is provided by the Renewable Energy System (Quaschning, 2003).
Moreover, we assume that the biomass resources are managed sustainably, therefore carbon dioxide
emission of biomass generators is neutral (Environmental Protection Agency , 2014).

While the operation plan of the microgrid can be obtained for any time spanning the 365 days in a
year, our analysis in this section focuses on two selected days, which are July 29 th and December 26th
in 2010. As weather conditions in winter differ greatly from those in summer and may significantly
impact the power generated from the DGs, these two days are selected to present the differences on the
obtained hourly-based operation plans and the scale identification in different seasons. In Figure 4, the
daily operation plans that are obtained for the microgrid in the selected two days are presented. It is
noticed that the biomass generators carried most of the burden to satisfy the power demand in the
microgrid. Moreover, great differences have been observed on the number of occurrences of different
scales identified in these two experimental days. During summer, due to the higher generation
capabilities of the solar panels, load demand in the MG can be satisfied by the “green” distributed
generators and the biomass generators most of time (23 out of 24 hours). However, during winter,
operating the environment-friendly DGs alone cannot provide enough power for the microgrid.
Differences on the operation plans for the MG in these two days reflect on the total cost and emissions
as well. Specifically, in December 26th, the obtained best compromise solution is $22,241.5 in terms of
cost and 1,313.6 Kg in terms of emissions, while in July 29th, they are $14,044.8 and 88.1 Kg,
respectively, indicating that it is much economical and more environmental friendly to operate the
microgrid in the summer.

In this study, additional experiments are carried out for demonstrating the performance of the
proposed particle filtering-based multi-objective optimization algorithm with various number of
iterations (i.e., ݇ ൌ ͷͲǡͳͲͲǡʹͲͲǡͷͲͲ). The Pareto-front obtained for these cases and the best cost and
emissions obtained with different number of iterations are provided in Table 4, where the solutions are
obtained from the operation plan for the microgrid at 11AM on December 26th. The resultant figures
depicted that the proposed optimization algorithms have the capability to capture a great diversity of
good solutions. It should also be noticed here that the algorithm’s performance on producing a
promising solution set is slightly impacted by the changing number of iterations. Therefore, it
premises the potential to generate good results with reduced computational burden.

4 Conclusion
In this work, a DDDAS approach is proposed for the operation planning problem within a
microgrid. The proposed approach involves a database that stores the system-related operational,
topological, and environmental data; an agent-based simulation simulating the operation of the
microgrid considering the uncertainties of the power generated from the DGs and fluctuation of the
demand; and an optimization module that solves the multi-objective optimization problem according
to the scale identified by the simulation. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated
via a synthetic microgrid with solar cells, wind turbines, biomass generators, and combined cycles.
Results have shown that the proposed approach has the capability to provide real-time operation plan
for the microgrid at any particular hour and have also indicated that the proposed particle filteringbased optimization algorithm can provide promising solutions without destroying the diversity of the
solutions and occupying significant computational efforts. The proposed approach is developed in a
generic manner. Therefore, it can be implemented for any microgrid that has similar types of
distributed generators when sufficient changes are made to the database.
In the future, the storage devices and maintenance times of biomass generators in the microgrid
will be taken into consideration when determining the operation plan. Moreover, since the
performance of the particle filtering-based optimization algorithm may depend on several factors, such
as the processing noises that control the efficiency of the sampling and resampling procedure; and the
frequency of variation for importance factors of objectives (i.e., the parameter ܳ incorporated in (20))
that may affect the convergence of the algorithm together with the number of iterations, the optimal
combination of these parameters will be investigated.
