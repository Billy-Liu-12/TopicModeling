Abstract
The Bayesian Computational Sensor Network methodology is applied to small-scale structural
health monitoring. A mobile robot, equipped with vision and ultrasound sensors, maps smallscale structures for damage (e.g., holes, cracks) by localizing itself and the damage in the map.
The combination of vision and ultrasound reduces the uncertainty in damage localization. The
data storage and analysis takes place exploiting cloud computing mechanisms, and there is also
an oﬀ-line computational model calibration component which returns information to the robot
concerning updated on-board models as well as proposed sampling points. The approach is
validated in a set of physical experiments.

Introduction

Structural health monitoring of aircraft poses a signiﬁcant problem in their exploitation and
maintence. To address this issue, the major speciﬁc objectives of our work are to:
1. Exploit Bayesian Computational Sensor Networks (BCSN) [14] to detect and identify
structural damage. Here we demonstrate the combination of a Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) method with the use of ultrasound to map damage in a small-scale
structure.
2. Exploit an active feedback methodology using model-based sampling advice which informs
the sample point selection during path planning for the monitoring task.
3. Provide a rigorous model-based systematic treatment of the uncertainty in the process,
including stochastic uncertainties of system states, unknown model parameters, dynamic
parameters of sensor nodes, and material damage assessments.
4. Achieve goals 1-3 exploiting cloud computing.

This work addresses 3 of
the 4 DDDAS (Dynamic DataDriven Analysis Systems) interdisciplinary research components: applications modeling, advances in mathematics and statistical algorithms, and application
measurement systems and methods, and more speciﬁcally addresses several questions raised in
the DDDAS-InfoSymbiotics 2010
Report [8] by Working Group

Measurement & Control Systems (Alok Chaturvedi, Adrian Figure 1: Small-scale Structural Health Monitoring in the

volves large amounts of data that
can result from heterogeneous and distributed sources which require analysis before automatically integrating them to the executing applications that need to use the data.” Figure 1 shows
a conceptual layout of the problem addressed here.
The mobile robot (SLAMBOT) is placed on the structure to be monitored (here an aircraft wing), and performs its analysis by interacting with storage and computational agents in
the cloud. In our work, the interaction is mediated by means of a highly customizable data
sharing model which provides low latency between sensing and computational resources (using optimized socket applications), and dynamic routing. The various components include (1)
the SLAMBOT, (2) storage capabilities for image and ultrasound data, (3) oﬀ-line simulation
agents which can dynamically calibrate models and provide optimal sample point locations,
and (4) some form of HCI agent (e.g., smartphone app or data analysis center). For another
view, see [4].
In the remainder of the paper, we describe the following aspects of the small-scale structural
health monitoring system:
1. Robot Monitoring Agents: a high-level monitoring agent is developed using the Contract Net approach; this agent is invoked by the human inspector. It in turn contracts
with the SLAMBOT to gather damage location information in terms of a map created
during the ultrasound examination of the small-scale structure.
2. Ultrasound Analysis Model: An ultrasound range sensor is described which exploits a
computational model of Lamb wave propagation through the structure to be monitored.
3. Cloud Computing Architecture: the cloud computing architecture allows various
agents to eﬃciently exchange data and information.
4. Validation Experiment: a physical experiment using an aluminum plate, and a mobile
robot is described which provides bounds on the uncertainty of the operation of the
monitoring process.

Robot Monitoring Agents

The monitoring task is divided between a virtual agent which manages the monitoring process
(the manager), and a set of inspection agents (the contractors) which are physical robots capable
of mapping damage in the structure of interest. In addition, the manager may request bids
on other aspects of the problem (e.g., computational simulations for model calibration, etc.).
This approach has been chosen so as to make the solution more general and applicable to a
wide variety of scenarios. For example, in aircraft inspection, we envision a set of SLAMBOT
type robots which may be tracked ground vehicles, or quadrotors that are available to provide
inspections, but which must be contracted to perform the work. The Contract Net protocol
[21] is used which follows the following sequence:
• The manager agent issues a general broadcast task announcement with an eligibility
speciﬁcation, a task abstract, a bid speciﬁcation and an expiration time.
• The contractor agents bid on tasks they can handle, and provide some information about
their capabilities.
• The manager agent then awards bids (perhaps multiple).
• The contractor agents then proceed with the task and may exchange information with
other agents as necessary to complete the task. They also store the acquired data in the
cloud so that it is available to other agents involved in the process. Once the task is
completed they announce that to the manager and submit a ﬁnal report.

2.1

The SLAMBOT

In the current version of the system, we have developed the SLAMBOT [26] (see Figure 2).
The SLAMBOT is equipped with a camera for SLAM, and two ultrasound sensors
(front and back) for damage analysis in the
structure. When taking ultrasound readings,
the SLAMBOT lifts itself up on the ultrasound sensors so as to press them ﬁrmly
against the material surface. The SLAMBOT is built on a Systronix Trackbot chassis and is a diﬀerential drive robot. The vision, motion, actuation and localization algorithms are implemented on-board by a minicomputer (pcDuino), which runs a version of
the Ubuntu operating system and interfaces
with the robot’s hardware directly. Its wi- Figure 2: SLAMBOT for Structural Health
ﬁ capability enables it to communicate with Monitoring.
the cloud server and other agents as necessary. The SLAMBOT is equipped with a Logitech C250 webcam for measurement (for locating
landmarks and ensuring a collision-free motion on the surface being inspected). The ultrasound
sensor carried by the robot is a VS900-RIC Vallen Systeme high sensitivity Acoustic Emission
(AE) sensor.1

SLAM

We have implemented the SLAM algorithm from Thrun et al. [23] with the following modiﬁcations. For a landmark located at [xL , yL ]T , and robot pose [x, y, θ]T , the sensor returns the
landmark’s coordinates with respect to the robot frame. The return z = [u, v]T can be written
as a function of [x, y, θ, xL , yL ]T as:
z=

u
v

= h(x, y, θ, xL , yL ) =

cΔx + sΔy
−sΔx + cΔy

where s = sin θ, c = cos θ, Δx = xL − x, and Δy = yL − y.
Then the Jacobian of h at [x, y, θ, xL , yL ]T is:
˜
H(x,
y, θ, xL , yL ) =

−c
s

−s

−sΔx + cΔy

According to the algorithm, the sensed data is considered to be from a new landmark if the
likelihood is low that it is from an existing landmark. Let μ
¯ be the mean of the current beliefs.
μ, xL , yL ]T , where xL and yL are the unique

¯x + c¯u − s¯v
μ

where c¯ = cos μ¯θ and s¯ = sin μ¯θ .
The update of the covariance matrix is more complicated. Since the new landmark was
unobserved before, it is natural to extend the current covariance matrix to

for some large γ. γ is taken to be in to make computation possible. We use the limit result
as γ → ∞ later in this subsection.
The Bayesian inference using the Extended Kalman Filter is given as follows. Let Q be the
covariance of the sensing noise, and let F ∈ 5×(3+2(N +1)) , where N is the number of existing
landmarks. All the entries of F are zeros except the upper 3 by 3 and lower 2 by 2 block

Ultrasound Range Sensor

Much work has been done on the theory and application of Lamb waves to structural health
monitoring (see [20, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 27, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 18, 19, 24, 13]). We make use of
these methods in our work. Given a received signal f : → and a time interval (t0 , t1 ), the
range ﬁnder estimates the trivial time of maximum energy delivery that is deﬁned by the CWT
(Continuous Wavelet Transform) based scaled-average wavelet power (SAP) (see [22], p. 166
for a description of this method) in (t0 , t1 ). Deﬁne function peek : C 2 ( ) × 2 → such that
peek(f, t0 , t1 ) = arg max sap(f )(t).
t∈(t0 ,t1 )

The peek function returns a t such that the SAP of signal f is maximized in (t0 , t1 ). Then the
range ﬁnder is deﬁned by
arg max |peek(f, t0 , t1 ) − peak(sig(d), −∞, ∞)|,
d∈

+

where sig(d) is the signal that should be received at distance d away from the actuator in the
homogeneous plate. In our simulation, we model the wave propagation by the 2D Helmholtz
Equation
Δu + k 2 u = g,
where g is the actuation signal and u is the wave function, and Sommerfeld radiation condition
lim

|x|→∞

|x|(n · ∇u − iku) = 0,

uniformly for all |n| = 1. If the actuator is located at xs and emits a signal g, the solution of
u is that
u(xr , t) =

∞
−∞

dωˆ
g (ω)G(xs , xr , ω)e−iωt ,

i (1)
H (k|x − y|),

where H is the Haenkel function, and k is the wave number that is a function of ω in dispersive
materials. For a thin plate, k can be approximated by the Lamb Wave approximation (see [25]).
Our sig function is deﬁned as
sig(d)(t) = u(xr , t)
for all |vxr − vxs | = d.
An ultrasound signal is transmitted by the emitter, and the receiver gets the directly propagated signal from emitter to receiver, followed by any signals reﬂected from features in the
material (e.g., damage locations, edges, etc.). Thus, the time of arrival of the reﬂected signal
allows the calculation of the distance traveled by that signal, and this means that the feature
causing the reﬂection is located somewhere on an ellipse around the emitter-receiver pair.
The following discussion follows our exposition in [15]. Several measurements are needed
to get the best location estimate for a feature; these range values are collected by having the
robot place the actuator and receiver at diﬀerent locations, and the location is constrained by
the corresponding ellipse. Thus, by using an accumulator array and adding a ’vote’ to each
location on the ellipse, these six sensed range values allow the determination of the most likely
2607

Bayesian Computational Sensor Networks: Small-scale Structural Health Monitoring
Wang, Joshi, Tirpankar, Erickson, Cline, Thangaraj, Henderson

location of the reﬂecting point (damage in this case). This ’voting’ is done with a Gaussian
spread which leads to a smooth accumulator surface.
Observed and simulated reﬂected A0 mode signals with known minimized possible reﬂection
range have signiﬁcant overlap between the directly propagated and simulated reﬂected signals.
This necessitates a method to separate reﬂected versus directly propagated waves in the observed data. In addition, we would like to isolate the main component of the reﬂected signal
in the data. To achieve this, signals outside a certain reﬂection range are eliminated. Figure 3
shows the windowed signals versus the simulated signals as described above. In this form, the
peak amplitude is not clearly identiﬁable. We therefore compute the CWTbased scaled-average
wavelet power (SAP) (see [22] page 166, for a description of this method). The computed SAPs
are shown in Figure 4; as can be seen in this ﬁgure, the peaks are more clearly discernible.

Data Routing Model for Distributed Cloud Computing

This is a highly customizable data sharing model between sensing and computing resources.
The model enables multiple sensing nodes to open connections with computing resources
and retrieve results. The presence of multiple processor and broker nodes nodes reduces
the chance of failure. RabbitMQ message broker provides reliable, ﬂexible, highly available
and multi-protocol communication system. It also provides the ability to handle multiple
protocols and supports message tracing. Figure 5 shows the current implementation layout.
As can be seen above, the system gains its advantages from the
ﬁve main components: (1) sensor
nodes, (2) router, and (3) processor
nodes. A model as customizable as
this enables failsafe and quick communication between resources while
providing isolation between sensing
and computing resources. The dynamic queuing eases development
and scalability.
Sensor Nodes The sensors on
the individual devices communicate with network connected sensor
nodes which in this case are phys- Figure 5: Cloud Component Architecture for Small-scale

tion can be over the preferred sensor
protocol. For example, GPS sensors
can exchange data over I2C or RS-232(serial) interconnects with the nodes. The sensor nodes
are applications running on host devices that have the capability of posting messages onto the
rabbitMQ message broker queues. The sensor nodes gather sensor data, serialize it and put
them onto the relevant work queues. Thus, they are unaware of the computing resources on
the cloud. Any processor capable of handling the work posted on the relevant work queue can
pick it up. Also, the node only needs to subscribe to the work queue that is relevant to it.
RabbitMQ Message Brokers This is a highly reliable message broker that has several
built in features. This has allowed us to create a fault tolerant, persistent messaging system
between processes running on disparate devices. Work queues can be spawned by remote
applications dynamically. This allows creation of a highly conﬁgurable easy to use messaging
system. It contains routing tables contain routing information regarding the available processing
and sensing nodes.
ContractNet Manager This agent arbitrates allocation of work awards to sensor node
agents that bid on a task. It accepts tasks provided by the user and sets up contracts. It
has knowledge of contractor capabilities that it uses in making this decision.
RabbitMQ/ContractNet Management Interface A web interface to a service running
on the message broker and contract manager allow us to monitor the messaging activity. This
2609

Bayesian Computational Sensor Networks: Small-scale Structural Health Monitoring
Wang, Joshi, Tirpankar, Erickson, Cline, Thangaraj, Henderson

helps in not only debugging the system but also in managing a large environment. This interface
allows manually declaring queues, sending and receiving messages and monitor connections.
Processor Nodes This application runs on a remote machine that has a good computing
capability. This application generally handles singular responsibilities but can also be used to
consolidate data from multiple sensors and take a decision based upon the multiple data points.

Validation Experiments

The aluminum panel in the experiment is 121.92cm2 , and 1.6 mm
thick, the sensors were VS900-RIC
Vallen transducers, and the excitation signal was a 200 KHz 5 cycle, Hann-windowed waveform. Figure 6 shows a trace of a sample
SLAM run; as can be seen, the localization results are good for the
robot and for nearby landmarks.
However, more distant landmarks
are poorly localized due to the
failure of the underlying assumptions. We are planning on performing a multi-robot SLAM with another tracked robot on the surface
and a quadrotor hovering above the
plate.
Figure 7 shows ellipses produced
by reﬂections from the boundary.

Conclusions and Future Work

We have developed a cloud-based architecture which supports multiple agents working together
to provide a structural health monitoring capability on a small-scale structure. This includes
2610

Bayesian Computational Sensor Networks: Small-scale Structural Health Monitoring

not only agents who contract for monitoring service and those that deliver it, but also agents
that analyze the data delivered by the monitoring robot (e.g., here this includes both camera
and ultrasound data; the Lamb wave based range ﬁnder function is performed by an oﬀ-line
agent in Matlab and that information can be exploited by the mobile robot running Python).
The combination of Lamb wave damage analysis with a robot SLAM methodology allows for
more autonomous mapping of damage in structures.
We are currently investigating the following aspects of the system:
• More precise mathematical characterization of the uncertainty in the results. While the
covariance matrix of the EKF SLAM method gives some insight into the uncertainty,
we believe that this can be further constrained by using multiple robots, and a better
understanding of the Lamb wave uncertainties.
• The system is being extended to include multiple robots in order to reduce the uncertainty
in the the localization results. Moreover, we are looking to use other bases for the SLAM
technique itself; e.g., Lamb wave reﬂection patterns at individual locations (e.g., similar
to visual SLAM based on the appearance of the surface), as well as other robots to locate
the ultrasound sensors on the surface.
• We also are looking at extending the system to inspecting composite materials. This will
be especially important for aircraft monitoring.
