Abstract
Texture operators are commonly used to describe image content for many purposes. Recently
they found its application in the task of emotion recognition, especially using local binary
patterns method, LBP. This paper introduces a novel texture operator called power LBP,
which deﬁnes a new ordering schema based on absolute intensity diﬀerences. Its deﬁnition as
well as interpretation are given.
The performance of suggested solution is evaluated on the problem of smiling and neutral
facial display recognition. In order to evaluate the power LBP operator accuracy, its discriminative capacity is compared to several members of the LBP family. Moreover, the inﬂuence of
applied classiﬁcation approach is also considered, by presenting results for k-nearest neighbour,
support vector machine, and template matching classiﬁers. Furthermore, results for several
databases are compared.
Keywords: power LBP, local binary patterns, classiﬁcation, emotion recognition

Introduction

There are many methods proposed in the literature [4, 12, 16] describing an image content
using the information included in the texture. The most general one – ﬁrst order features [20]
– are based on the intensity distribution over an image histogram. They are enriched with
additional parameters describing histogram mean, variance, or skewness. Other – second order
features [12], [24] – concentrate on spatial relations between the luminance intensities within
an image. Hence the spatial relation between pixel value distribution are also incorporated in
the co-occurrence matrices, which are the starting point for many parameters calculation, for
instance texture contrast, entropy, and information. Works developing this technique for color
information are also presented in the literature, e.g. [19]. Diﬀerent approach presents graytone diﬀerence matrix [5], which attempts to deﬁne a texture measures correlated to human

perception of texture. Next, the run-length matrix proposed in [10] is based on the assumption
that textures of good quality are characterised by a small number of consecutive pixels in a given
direction with similar luminance. On the contrary, the coarse textures are related to longer
runs. There are many possibilities to calculate features describing various texture parameters
[4],[6],[23]. More recently histograms of oriented gradients proved to well describe the texture
[8] for human detection. Some smoothing ﬁlters are presented in application for snowﬂake
recognition in [15]. Moreover, abstract templates used for face detection in [11] synthesise
texture, shape and scale of the object.
Apart from the techniques previously described, the local binary patterns operator [16] is
widely used. This method interprets the texture as a two-dimensional phenomenon characterized by two orthogonal properties: spatial structure (pattern) and contrast (the “amount” of
local image texture). The deﬁnition starts from the joint distribution of luminance value on
a circularly symmetric neighbour set of pixels in a local processing region. Then an operator
invariant against any monotonic transformation of luminance is derived. Tolerance for rotation
is achieved by incorporating a ﬁxed set of rotation invariant patterns by this operator.
This work introduces a novel power LBP (local binary patterns) texture operator which
redeﬁnes the way of LBP rank calculation. Its image description capabilities are evaluated in
the task of smiling and neutral facial display recognition. Several databases are exploited in
order to get better insight in the accuracy of this descriptor. The achieved results are compared
with other texture operators from (LBP) family.
Section 2 shortly describes existing LBP methods. Next in Section 3 the power LBP approach is introduced. Since in case of emotion recognition the system set-up demands some
preprocessing, all necessary details are given in Section 4. The results of performed experiments
are presented in Section 5 followed by conclusions drawn in Section 6.

Local binary patterns

Local binary patterns [16, 17, 18] [21, Ch. 2] is an operator which characterises a small texture
regions. It assumes to work on the monochromatic image I, where for each pixel, the ﬁnal code
is calculated considering the sign s(z) of the diﬀerences between central pixel value I(x0 ) and
its P neighbours pixel values I(xk ) sampled on a circle of given radius R (see Fig. 1):
P

LBPP,R (x0 ) =

s{I(xk ) − I(x0 )} · 2k−1 ,

As the LBP values assigned to the image pixels for P = 8 are in the range [0, 255], they can
be visualized in form of 8-bit images. Figure 2 depicts exemplary images (a, d), corresponding
maps of LBP values (b, e) and the LBP histograms (c, f).
It was noticed in [21][Ch. 2] that not all codes have the same importance. Some of them
seem less relevant and therefore might ﬁll a common bin of the histogram, whereas others need
to be stored separately. When one looks at the code as a sequence of bits, those valid are
characterised by up to two transitions between 0s and 1s, eg. 00111000, and are called uniform
patterns, (uLBP). This is a natural compression of descriptive data since the histogram length
is diminished.
On the other hand, when the image rotates, the distribution of the generated codes in the
histogram moves correspondingly [3], [21][Ch. 2]. That disables correct classiﬁcation in case of
the texture rotation. Yet noticing that the points used to generate the code are sampled on
the circle, one can easily ﬁnd out, that rotation of the bits should remove the unwanted result.
Therefore, a mapping operator ROR(m,i) was introduced, which is responsible for circular
bitwise right rotation of a bit sequence m by i steps:
riLBPP,R = min ROR(LBPP,R , i).

One can also imagine the combination of rotation invariance applied for uniform local binary
pattern, what gives a new texture operator called riuLBP.

Power LBP

The LBP operator can be regarded as a transformation which is based on the ranks of the gray
scale values I(x0 ), I(x1 ), . . . , I(xP ) of the pixels x0 , x1 , . . . , xP , belonging to the local processing
window W centered at x0 as depicted in Fig. 3 a).
If we perform the ordering of the pixel intensities, an ascending sequence of values
I(0) , I(1) , . . . , I(P ) is obtained. Using this notation, the pixel with lowest intensity has rank
0, and the pixel with maximum intensity has rank P , if all the pixels diﬀer from each other. In
case that two or more pixels have the same intensity we can assign them the same rank. This
procedure is called dense ranking: items that compare equal, receive the same ranking number,
and the next item(s) receive the immediately following ranking.
Assuming that the rank Ψ of the central pixel x0 of W is ρ0 , (Ψ(x0 ) = ρ0 ) we can deﬁne
the basic LBP as an operation which assigns 0 to the pixels whose rank is less than ρ0 and 1
otherwise. In this way instead of Eq. 1 we can write
P

LBPP,R (x0 ) =

s{Ψ(xk ) − ρ0 } · 2k−1 .

(4)

k=1

The ranking procedure is based only on the gray scale values of the pixels intensity and
does not consider the distribution of the pixel intensities. Instead of assigning 0 or 1 using the
simple ordering criterion, we propose to assign to each pixel xi from W the cumulated distance
deﬁned as
P

|I(xi ) − I(xk )|γ ,

Dx i =

i = 0, . . . , P,

(5)

k=0

where γ > 0 is the power. The ordering of pixels can be now performed with regard to the
value of sum of absolute diﬀerences between pixels denoted as D raised to the power γ. The
generation of the new power LBP code is illustrated in Fig. 4.
Then the pixels x0 , x1 , . . . , xP can be ordered according to the corresponding values of
D0 , D1 , . . . , DP . In this way a new ordering scheme based on the sum of absolute intensity
diﬀerences raised to the power γ is introduced. For γ = 1, this procedure enables to calculate
the median of the intensities, which is the pixel x(0) with minimum cumulated distance D(0) ,

where D(k) denotes the k-th smallest value of D. For γ = 2, the pixel with rank 0 in the ordered
sequence is the one closest to the average of the pixel intensities.
In this way, we can determine the rank of the central pixel x0 of the processing window
and calculate the LBP value based on the newly deﬁned ranks using Eq. (4). To avoid dense
ranking procedure in the situation in which the central pixel has the same cumulative value
Dx0 as one of its neighbors, we can simply write
P

LBPP,R (x0 ) =

s{Dxk − Dx0 } · 2k−1 ,

Experiment set-up

The performance of the novel power LBP operator was examined using three diﬀerent databases:
Cohn-Kanade, Utrecht, and All. The image description accuracy between smiling and neutral
facial displays was compared with other approaches to local binary patterns methods: LBP,
uLBP, riLBP, and riuLBP. In all presented experiments the set-ups used for calculation were
similar, only the texture operator diﬀered.

4.1

Database presentation

Cohn-Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression Database [7], [14] consists of images with facial
display representing six basic emotions: joy, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. They
are annotated with information which muscles groups were activated during the emotion. Those
muscles’ groups are called Action Units and were deﬁned by Ekman [9] enabling deﬁnition of
Facial Action Coding System, FACS.
For the performed experiments images representing 82 subjects for smiling and neutral facial
display were selected. The image digital resolution is 640×480 pixels with 8-bit precision for

a gray scale values. The subjects do not wear glasses or other covering elements, as well as do
not have beards. Some examples are presented in Fig. 5.
Utrecht image database was collected at the European Conference on Visual Perception in
Utrecht, 2008 [2]. The database consists of 131 colour images of 49 male and 20 female subjects
usually taken for neutral and smiling expression. Each image has 900×1200 pixels resolution.
In the presented experiment the smiling and neutral expressions were represented by 61 images
in each group (see examples in Fig. 6).
Since many of the available databases containing emotion are rather small, it is diﬃcult to
generalize the achieved results. Therefore, we decided to use a bigger dataset for evaluation. In
order to accomplish this goal, the All image database was prepared. It contains of 712 images
equally representing two groups of emotions, and gathers images from the two already presented
image datasets as well as from Feret [1], Iranian, Nottinghams original, and Pain databases [2].

4.2

System set-up overview

Preparing the data for classiﬁcation is a complex process, which crucial steps are depicted in
Fig. 7. In the input image, the face area is speciﬁed by the face detector described in [13] and
resized to constant resolution of 112 × 150 pixels. Then the feature vector is obtained for a
chosen texture operator. Notwithstanding, calculating global texture operator for the whole
image is too general, therefore the face area is divided into 7×10 rectangular subregions, for
which the LBP histograms are obtained. Next, all histograms are concatenated in order to
build the ﬁnal feature vector. This approach enables detailed description of each part of the
face, which is necessary in order to ﬁnd diﬀerences between emotion displays. Finally, the
classiﬁcation process takes place, during which 10-fold cross-validation schema is exploited due
to small number of objects in dataset.

4.3

Classiﬁcation approaches

In the literature concerning the problem of emotion recognition a plethora classiﬁcation methods are exploited. Therefore, in order to better understand the accuracy of presented image
description technique, the most popular classiﬁers are exploited:

Figure 7: System data ﬂow overview.
kNN k-nearest neighbourhood method represents the non-parametric approach, where the
classiﬁcation of tested element is based on the majority vote of k closest elements in the
training set. For described experiments cityblock distance metric was used and k = 9.
SVM Support vector machine transforms the data into high-dimensional space in order to
ﬁnd a separation plane between objects from diﬀerent classes. In the experiments linear
kernel proved to give the best results.
TM Template matching requires generation of average feature vector for each class, then kNN
with k = 1 votes for the one which is the most similar to the tested element. The distance
is calculated using chi square metrics as detailed in [22].

Results

The goal of the experiment was to compare the performance of the novel power LBP operator
with other texture operators belonging to the local binary pattern family: LBP, uLBP, riLBP,
and riuLBP. All of them were calculated for P = 8 sampling points distributed on the circle of
radius R = 1, the power parameter was set to 1. The recognition accuracy was evaluated using
three databases: Cohn-Kanade, Utrecht, and All with diﬀerent classiﬁcation approaches: kNN,
SVM, and TM.
Table 1 presents data gathered for the kNN classiﬁcation method for all examined image
sets. One can see that independently of the database the best scores are recorded for LBP,
uLBP, and power LBP image description techniques. When the rotation invariant version of
the operators is applied (riLBP and riuLBP) the eﬃciency diminishes by a few percent. The
most beneﬁcial classiﬁcation between smiling and neutral facial displays takes place when the
novel, power LPB, operator is applied; the score reaches: 84.92%, 94.48%, and 78.69% for All,
Cohn-Kanade, and Utrecht image databases, respectively.
Similar pattern in described image descriptors is visible when linear SVM is applied (see
Tab. 2). Once again the rotation invariant version of LBP deteriorates by 6-8% in comparison
with other local binary pattern approaches. Here, the variety in accuracy for the best methods is
minimal. Yet in case of the most general All dataset the power LBP brings the best performance
of 90.75%, for Utrecht it is comparable with uLBP operator with score 86.07%, and for CohnKanade it reaches 96.93% similarly as LBP, which is a little bit less accurate when compared
to uLBP 97.55%.

Results of experiments concerning the TM classiﬁcation technique are presented in Tab. 3.
Firstly, the most beneﬁcial method for All database is still power LBP with correct classiﬁcation
ratio equal to 85.35%, the LBP technique is not far behind. The results follow the same pattern
when the other databases are concerned. Secondly, in case of Cohn-Kanade image set, the
best performance is 92.02% gathered for uLBP, whereas power LBP achieves 90.80%. More
interesting is the fact, that in this test, the rotation invariant techniques brought comparable
results around 90%. Finally, for the Utrecht database the performance is very low regardless of
applied texture operator.
Looking at the results from other perspective one can easily notice, that the best performance
is achieved when linear SVM classiﬁcation is applied. Only for this solution the eﬃcacy reaches
almost 98% for Cohn-Kanade database and are around 90% for the other image sets. On the
other hand, the weakest accuracy was recorded when the TM technique was used. Finally, the
results diﬀer depending on the image set. The best accuracy corresponds to the best image
quality gained in the Cohn-Kanade database. The Utrecht data is also characterised by high
resolution, but the subjects are wearing glasses or have beards, moreover in some pictures
artefacts from the light reﬂections are visible. Probably all this circumstances inﬂuence the
accuracy.
In order to give better overview, additional tests using other texture operators in similar
experiment set-up were performed for the Cohn-Kanade database. Once again the best results
were recorded in case of linear SVM and are as follows: for co-occurence matrix operator
the correct classiﬁcation ratio equals 88.42%, for run length matrix 88.42%, and for gray-tone
diﬀerence matrix 65.48%, which proves the superiority of LBP family approach.
Apart from the classiﬁcation accuracy of the power LBP, the inﬂuence of the power γ
parameter on the performance in case of varying conditions due to illumination change and
noise was investigated. In order to perform such experiment clone versions of Cohn-Kanade
datasets were prepared, where each of them included one of the following changes: Poisson
noise, salt & pepper noise (probability=0.05), and variation in illumination, which consisted
of linear light changes in the image in direction from top to bottom, right to left and vice
versa, combined with irregular lighting starting in each corner (see Fig. 8). Figure 9 depicts
the results when recognition between smiling and neutral facial display on each of considered
versions of the Cohn-Kanade database was examined with linear SVM. The plot shows that
in comparison with classiﬁcation performance in case of stable lighting conditions (original
database), outcomes in case of varying lighting conditions do not change much, especially for
higher values of the power γ. The algorithm is also resistible to Poisson noise and diminishes
its accuracy by few percents when salt & pepper noise is considered.

Conclusions

This work introduces the novel power LBP operator, giving its deﬁnition followed by interpretation. The accuracy of data description is evaluated on the problem of smiling and neutral
facial display classiﬁcation with utilization of three diﬀerent datasets: All, Cohn-Kanade, and
Utrecht. The performance is compared with other well known texture operators from local
binary pattern family: LBP, uLBP, riLBP, and riuLBP. According to gathered results, the
accuracy in most cases were the highest among considered techniques or comparable with outcomes recorded for LBP and uLBP approaches. In the future we will focus on the eﬀectiveness
of the uniform and rotation invariant versions of the introduced power LBP operator.
