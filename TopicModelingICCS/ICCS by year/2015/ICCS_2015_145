Abstract
We propose a numerical approach based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) for dealing
with mesh reﬁnement of Non-uniform Staggered Cartesian Grid. We explain, in detail, the
strategy for mapping LBM over such geometries. The main beneﬁt of this approach, compared
to others, consists of solving all ﬂuid units only once per time-step, and also reducing considerably the complexity of the communication and memory management between diﬀerent reﬁned
levels. Also, it exhibits a better matching for parallel processors. To validate our method, we
analyze several standard test scenarios, reaching satisfactory results with respect to other stateof-the-art methods. The performance evaluation proves that our approach not only exhibits a
simpler and eﬃcient scheme for dealing with mesh reﬁnement, but also fast resolution, even in
those scenarios where our approach needs to use a higher number of ﬂuid units.
Keywords: Lattice-Boltzmann Method, Mesh Reﬁnement, Parallel Algorithms, Multicore.

Introduction

Advanced strategies for the eﬃcient implementation of computationally intensive numerical
methods have a strong interest in the industrial and academic community. The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a clever discretization of the Boltzmann equation [15]. Multiple studies
have compared the eﬃciency of LBM with other methods [1, 5], showing that it can achieve
an equivalent numerical accuracy over a large number of applications. Due to the particular
features of LBM, it has been adapted to numerous parallel computer architectures, such as
multicore CPU [11], manycore accelerators [16] and cluster [9] being a very proﬁtable method

for parallel computing, showing a high MFLUPS (Millions of Fluid Lattice Updates per Second) ratio. Also, given the growing popularity of LBM, multiple tools [19, 7] have arisen which
has consolidated this method into academia and industry. In particular, in this work we have
considered the LBM-HPC framework [7] as our reference software tool.
LBM is an eﬃcient and fast method, however the usage of Cartesian grids is expensive.
Although scientiﬁc problems exist for which a homogeneous description of the domain is a
reasonable choice, it is usually desirable to solve regions of high geometrical complexity with a
ﬁner grid to minimize the computational cost. In this sense, the main contribution of this work
is a reﬁnement approach based on a Non-uniform Staggered Cartesian Grid (NSCG) for LBM
solvers. This approach has been previously considered over other methods [20].
Several reﬁnement techniques have been implemented for LBM-based solvers, such as
adaptive-mesh-reﬁnement (ARM) [2], multi-grid [14], and multi-domain [6]. Each of these
techniques exhibit its own advantages and disadvantages. For ARM and multi-grid the coarse
grid is present all over the simulation domain. In the multi-domain reﬁnement, the regions
where reﬁned patches are inserted are taken oﬀ the coarse grid. The multi-domain method exhibits better performances and higher memory savings and a more complex grids coupling with
respect to the other two approaches. Nevertheless, those approaches based on ARM present the
most complex scenario for data management, due mainly to its dynamic data structure, while
the multi-grid operations are more proﬁtable for programming and data management. All these
approaches require the use of synchronization points as there exists a data dependence among
the diﬀerent reﬁned levels, such that those reﬁned regions must be computed at least several
times per time-step. All this degrades the performance and disfavors the implementation on
parallel processors. Our NSCG approach attempts to address these shortcommings by reducing
considerably the complexity of the previous reﬁnement approaches.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the main characteristics of LBM;
Section 3 brieﬂy describes the physical problem at hand and the general numerical framework
that has been selected to cope with it (LBM coupled with NSCG technique). Section 4 and 5,
numerical accuracy and performance studies are performed, respectively; ﬁnally, in Section 6
some conclusions are outlined.

Lattice-Boltzmann Method

Lattice-Boltzmann methods (LBM) combines those characteristics developed to solve the Boltzmann equation over a ﬁnite number of microscopic speeds. In this sense, LBM presents some
lattice-symmetry features which allow the conservation of the macroscopic moments [3]. The
standard lattice-Boltzmann method [13] is an explicit-time-step solver for incompressible ﬂows.
This numerical scheme divides each temporal iteration into two steps, one for propagationadvection (stream) and a collision step which represents inter-particle interactions, achieving
a ﬁrst order in time and second order in space method. This method describes the ﬂuid behavior at mesoscopic level. At this level the ﬂuid is modeled by a distribution function of the
microscopic particles, f . Similarly to the Boltzmann equation, LBM solves the particle speed
distribution by discretizing the speed space over a discrete ﬁnite number of possible speeds.
The distribution function evolves according to the equation:
∂f
+ c∇f = Ω
(1)
∂t
where f is the particle distribution function, c is the discrete space of speeds and Ω is the
collision operator. By discretizing the distribution function f in space, in time and in speed
297

(c = ci ) we obtain fi (x, t) which describes the probability of ﬁnding a particle at time t located
at x with speed ci .
The term c∇f can be descritized as:
fi (x + ci Δt, t + Δt) − fi (x, t + Δt)
(2)
Δt
In this way the particles can only move along the links of a regular Lattice (Figure 1)
deﬁned by the discrete speeds (c0 = c(0, 0); ci = c(±1, 0), c(0, ±1), i = 1 · · · 4; ci =
c(±1, ±1), c(±1, ±1), i = 5 · · · 8 with c = Δx/Δt), so that the synchronous particle displacements Δxi = ci Δt never take the ﬂuid particles away from the Lattice. In the present work,
we follow the standard two-dimensional 9-speed lattice D2Q9 [3].

The operator Ω describes the changes suﬀered by the collision of the microscopic particles

Through the use of this collision operator and substituting the term ∂f

The Non-uniform Staggered Cartesian Grid (NSCG)
Algorithm for Lattice-Boltzmann Method

This section describes the main idea behind our algorithm, which consists of the concept that
the usage of diﬀerent relaxation frequencies (δ = 1/τ ) for the same lattice unit can be considered
for dealing with reﬁned grids. Figure 2 illustrates some classical simulation cases for uniform
(top) and non-uniform (bottom) grid reﬁnement.

Figure 2: Grid geometry for the ﬁrst test scenario, channel ﬂow (left), and second one, ﬂow past
square cylinder (medium → A sub-scenario and right → B sub-scenario), for the multi-domain
(top) and NSCG (bottom) approaches.
The rescaling of physical quantities is inspired by the work by [6]. In the following, we work
in lattice units, the c subindex is assigned to coarse grid units, while the f subindex for ﬁne
grid units. To keep the discussion simple we chose to reﬁne the grid by a factor of two only.
Thus, Δxc and Δxf are the spatial discretization of the coarse and ﬁne grid respectively, so it
follows that: Δxf = Δxc /2.
Given the aforementioned relation, the rescaling of the relaxation time now needs to be
discussed. Let the Reynolds number be: Ren = Un Ln /vn , where n refers to ﬁne (f ) or coarse
(c) domain, U , L, v are the characteristic velocity, the characteristic length-scale and the
viscosity, respectively. Un and Ln are given by: Un = U Δtn /Δxn and Ln = L/Δxn . Forcing
the Reynolds number to be independent of the grid, one obtains:

graph as c, f and r respectively.
Depending on the direction to be reﬁned, one of the three diﬀerent δ factors, δc , δf , are
considered δr . Both, δc and δf have been described in the above subsection. δr is computed as
arithmetic average of the other two δ factors (δr = (δc + δf )/2). This scheme only aﬀects the
collision-LBM stage (Equation 9):
Next, we present the coupling algorithm: It consists of a simple communication from/to the
diﬀerent reﬁned levels, which aﬀects only the streaming-LBM stage. In essence, an adaptation
to the local relaxation factor is performed before computing the streaming step over those lattice functions (fi ), which need to be communicated to boundary regions among the diﬀerent
levels. To visualize the diﬀerences among our NSCG algorithm with respect to standard LBM,
the major steps of our method are now detailed:
Given fi (x, t) compute:
ρ=
fi (x, t) and
ρu =
ci fi (x, t)
Collision stage:
fi∗ (x, t + Δt) = fi (x, t) − δ∗ (fi (x, t) − fieq (x, t))
Depending on the lattice direction (i) and the reﬁnement level associated, δc , δr or δf is
considered.
Streaming stage:

If target (fit ) and source (fis ) lattice direction share the same reﬁnement level do:
fi (x + ci Δt, t + Δt) = fi∗ (x, t + Δt)
If the target lattice-direction reﬁnement level is diﬀerent do:
fit = fis − δ∗t (fis − fis−eq )
To clarify, next, we show the transfers from/to the lattices, for the streaming major step,
according to the simple geometry illustrated by Figure 3. The enumeration is in agreement
with respect to Figure 1.
f2c = f2hor.−f − δc (f2hor.−f − f2hor.−f −eq )

f1hor.−f = f1c − δf (f1c − f1c−eq )

f6c = f6f − δc (f6f − f6f −eq )

f4ver.−f = f4c − δf (f4c − f4c−eq )

f3c = f3ver.−f − δc (f3ver.−f − f3ver.−f −eq )

f8f = f8c − δf (f8c − f8c−eq )

The previous case can be easily generalized for the rest of streaming cases. Unlike other
reﬁnement approaches, [6, 2, 14], the LBM-steps are computed on every ﬂuid node only once
per time step. It is not necessary to have additional overlapping regions between the diﬀerent
reﬁned levels and complex communication (interpolation) processes from/to each of the levels.
Also, our new approach allows to reﬁne only in one direction, which can be very appropriate
and accurate-enough for some scenarios(Figure 2-left), demanding a lower computational cost.
However, when dealing with reﬁned domains over more than one direction, additional lattice
units are necessary (Figure 2-medium and right).

Numerical Validation

To validate our NSCG approach for the LBM we carry out two diﬀerent test scenarios: the ﬁrst
being a classical channel ﬂow, while the second one is a simulation of the ﬂow past a square
cylinder. In both scenarios, three diﬀerent LBM implementations are compared: No reﬁnement,
where no reﬁned ﬂuid domain is considered; multi-domain approach (MDA) based on the work
of D. Lagrava et al. [6]; and our NSCG approach.
In the ﬁrst scenario, the reﬁned region is located in the bottom-half of the ﬂuid domain. The
multi-domain consists of a one-step coarse and a two-step ﬁne algorithm over the horizontal
and vertical directions [6]. In contrast, the NSCG considers only a one-step ﬁne reﬁnement over
the horizontal direction. Figure 2-left graphically illustrates the diﬀerent grid geometries with
respect to MDA and NSCG approaches, for the ﬁrst test scenario. To clarify Table 1 contains the
diﬀerent settings for every approach in terms of the number of lattice units. Several Reynolds
numbers (50, 100, 150 and 200) have been tested for the same conﬁguration. In LBM the
Reynolds number equation (Re = UυL ) is related to the relaxation time τ (Equation 6) as:
τ = [(3 ∗ U L)/Re] + 0.5 [15].
To visualize the numerical accuracy of every approach, we illustrate, in Figure 4, the horizontal velocity, for each Reynolds number, on the plane x = 100 over the ﬁne-grid for time step
500.
On the other hand, in the second scenario are considered two sub-scenarios, A and B (Figure 2-medium and right). The ﬁner domain is located around and behind the square cylinder.
For the NSCG, two additional reﬁned regions are necessary. One located in the top-bottom
around the main reﬁned region, and one located in the left (B sub-scenario) and left-right (A
sub-scenario) of the cylinder. For the cylinder diameter D, the grid ﬂow is set as 21D × 14D.
When the Reynolds number is lower than 100, there is no vortex structure formed during the

the symmetric rectangular zones disappear and an asymmetric pattern is formed. The vorticity is shed behind the circular cylinder, and vortex structures are formed downstream. This
phenomenon is well-capture by our NSCG approach. It is graphically illustrated in Figure 5.

results, the coeﬃcients were calculated and compared with the results of previous studies (Table

Performance Study

Before visualizing the performance results (Figure 6), it is important to note that multi domain
approach requires a higher number of points compared to NSCG approach for the ﬁrst scenario
(Table 1). However, in the second scenario the NSCG approach requires of a higher number of

To evaluate the eﬃciency of our approach, we perform a set of tests which consists of the
same scenarios studied for the numerical validation. The computational platform consists of a
single computational node of the supercomputing Lindgren Cray XE6 system based on AMD
Opteron 12-core Magny-Cours (2.1 GHz) processors at KTH. In particular, we have carried out
all our performance studies over a node composed of 24 cores divided between 2 sockets, with
12 cores each ( L1 cache: 64KB data cache, L2 cache: 512KB per core, L3 cache: 12MB per
processor) and 32 GB DDR3 per node using the cc compiler and -fopenmp -O3 as optimization
ﬂags.
In this performance analysis (Figure 6), we obtain execution time (ms) and MFLUPS (Millions of Fluid Units Per Second) ratio (M F LU P S = (#F luid U nits/time(s))/106 ), considering 1, 12 and 24 OpenMP-threads. Table 3 illustrates the beneﬁt (speedup) of our ap303

Conclusions

In this work we have proposed, developed and analyzed a new approach for dealing with mesh
reﬁnement over LBM based on Non-uniform Staggered Cartesian Grid (NSCG). This approach
exhibits a similar numerical accuracy compared to LBM reﬁnement method based on multidomain, Also it requires a lower computational and programming eﬀort. The NSCG approach
has been validated and analyzed for three diﬀerent test scenarios. Although the gain of using
our approach is reﬂected in every test, the beneﬁt is greater when dealing with a higher number
of threads, thus, it is a proﬁtable scheme for parallel processors.
As a future research topic we plan to investigate more complex physical scenarios which
require a higher amount of memory, making the use of memory distributed platforms mandatory.
In addition, we plan to analyze other parallel platforms such as the nVidia GPU and the Intel
Xeon Phi, as well as to implement more elaborate strategies for memory management and data
distribution.
