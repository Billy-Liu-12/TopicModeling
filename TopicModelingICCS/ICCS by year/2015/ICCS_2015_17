Abstract
A spectral method for kinetic plasma simulations based on the expansion of the velocity distribution function in a variable number of Hermite polynomials is presented. The method is
based on a set of non-linear equations that is solved to determine the coeﬃcients of the Hermite
expansion satisfying the Vlasov and Poisson equations. In this paper, we ﬁrst show that this
technique combines the ﬂuid and kinetic approaches into one framework. Second, we present an
adaptive strategy to increase and decrease the number of Hermite functions dynamically during
the simulation. The technique is applied to the Landau damping and two-stream instability
test problems. Performance results show 21% and 47% saving of total simulation time in the
Landau and two-stream instability test cases, respectively.

Introduction

Plasma physics is a fundamental research discipline that is extremely important for everyday
technologies and industrial applications. Some of the main technological driving forces for
innovation in the ﬁeld are the development of fusion devices for energy generation, propulsion
systems for space exploration, and techniques for plasma etching to fabricate integrated circuits.
Laboratory, space and astrophysical plasmas consist of electrons and ions characterized by mass
diﬀerence encompassing at least three orders of magnitude. This diﬀerence of mass drives
diﬀerent dynamics occurring over a large range of time and spatial scales. Because of this
multi-scale nature, numerical modelling of plasmas is extremely challenging.
A plasma can be described with macroscopic quantities, such as density, bulk velocity and
pressure. The evolution of these quantities satisﬁes the equations describing the conservation
of mass, momentum and energy in a ﬂuid element. These equations are typically referred to as
“ﬂuid” equations. In fact, plasmas can be accurately described with ﬂuid equations in several
cases, for instance in the strongly collisional limit. Fluid equations together with an equation

of state and Maxwell’s equations can be solved to determine the macroscopic evolution of a
plasma. However, the ﬂuid approach fails in describing the microscopic physics for which the
solution of the kinetic equations is required. The kinetic equations describe the evolution of
the distribution function, a quantity related to the probability of ﬁnding a plasma particle at
a given position and velocity at a certain time. The dependence of the distribution function
on the velocity variable is the reason for the name “kinetic”. The kinetic description provides
an excellent plasma model but it requires large computational resources. For this reason, it
is often limited to study small systems over a small time period. The development of new
computational methods that couple the ﬂuid and kinetic approaches is highly desirable and it
has been the focus of many recent studies [1, 2, 3].
The most common technique to solve numerically the kinetic equations is the Particle-inCell (PIC) method [4, 5, 6]. The PIC method is a statistical representation of the distribution
function by means of computational particles. Because of this, PIC methods are subject to
statistical noise aﬀecting the accuracy of the simulation.
In this paper, we focus on the Hermite-Fourier (HF) approach, which solves the VlasovMaxwell equations to determine the evolution of the distribution function. The method is
based on the decomposition of the distribution function in Hermite polynomials, leading to a
(truncated) set of moment equations. The HF technique removes the problem of noise, allowing
for kinetic simulations with high accuracy. The use of Hermite functions to solve the Vlasov
equation was proposed for the ﬁrst time by Grad [7] in 1949. The explicit numerical solution
of the Vlasov-Poisson system with the HF method has been presented by Schumer [8] in one
dimension and in electrostatic limit. Recent works propose semi-implicit and fully implicit
discretizations in the HF method [9, 10]. Finally, Delzanno [11] extended the HF method to
multiple dimensions and to the fully electromagnetic case.
The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we show that the HF method combines the ﬂuid and
kinetic approaches in one framework. The method naturally links near-Maxwellian plasmas that
can be represented with very few moments (akin to a ﬂuid description) with plasmas where the
kinetic physics drives strong non-Maxwellian behaviour and therefore many moments are needed
for an accurate representation of the distribution function. Second, we present a technique
to change the number of Hermite functions dynamically during the simulation, resulting in
reduction of the computation time relative to the case where the number of moments is ﬁxed.
We tested the new technique for two standard plasma physics test problems: the Landau
damping and the two-stream instability.
This paper is organized as follows. In the second section, the governing equations and the
HF spectral method are summarized. The third section shows how the HF method combines
both kinetic and ﬂuid approaches. The fourth section presents a new technique to adapt the
number of Hermite functions during the simulation to save computational time. Section 5
presents the results for the Landau damping and two-stream instability problems. Finally,
Section 6 summarizes the results and outlines future work.

The Hermite-Fourier Spectral Method

The HF method solves the Vlasov-Maxwell system numerically. It describes the evolution of
the distribution function of a collisionless plasma under the eﬀect of an electromagnetic ﬁeld.
For simplicity, we only present equations in one-dimensional Cartesian geometry and in the
electrostatic limit (no magnetic ﬁeld present).
The Vlasov equation describes the evolution of the distribution function f (x, v, t) in time,
where x and v represent spatial and velocity coordinates. Hereafter we use normalized (non1149

where ns = fs (x, v, t) dv is density of the species s.
The main idea of the HF method of Refs. [9, 10, 11] is to use the Asymmetrically-Weighted
(AW) Hermite functions to describe the velocity dependence of the distribution function. The
AW Hermite basis functions are deﬁned as:
2

Ψn (ξ) = (π2n n!)−1/2 Hn (ξ)e−ξ ,
Ψn (ξ) = (2n n!)−1/2 Hn (ξ),

(3)

where Hn is the Hermite polynomial of the n-th order [12]. The ﬁrst six basis functions are shown
in Figure 1. It is important to note in Figure 1 that the 0-th order AW Hermite polynomial is a
Maxwellian function. For this reason, just one AW Hermite polynomial is suﬃcient to describe
the distribution function of a Maxwellian plasma.

where L is the length of spatial domain and k is the (integer) mode number. The distribution

To solve the problem of the ﬁlamentation (the development of increasingly small phase space

with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov technique [14]

Fluid-Kinetic Coupling

In this section, we show that the HF method combines the ﬂuid and kinetic approach in one
framework. This is achieved by showing that the ﬁrst three equations of the system (7) correspond to the ﬂuid equations. The ﬁrst ﬂuid equation expresses the conservation of density
n(x, t). Hereafter ﬂuid quantities are given for each species, but for simplicity index for species s
is ignored. We also choose the laboratory reference frame u = 0 and the velocity normalization
parameter α = 1. By integrating (5) over velocity space and neglecting spatial expansion in
Fourier basis, we obtain:
NH −1

n(x, t) =

Cn (x, t)Ψn (v) dv = C0

f (x, v, t) dv =

⇒

C0 = n

(11)

n=0

In the sum above all integrals with Hermite mode higher than zero vanish, as follows from
orthogonality properties of Hermite polynomials [15].
The ﬂuid (or bulk) velocity is deﬁned as vavg = n1 vf dv. Following the same procedure,
we can express vavg = vf dv/n in terms of Hermite coeﬃcients as:
vavg =

We insert relations (11) and (12) in the ﬁrst equation (m = 0) of the system (7) and for u = 0
and α = 1 obtain the continuity equation:

(vavg n) = 0.

To derive the ﬂuid equation of momentum conservation, we note that the stress tensor P in the

obtain the conservation of momentum (u = 0 and α = 1):

Dynamically Adaptive Number of Hermite Functions

In this section, we describe a new technique developed to change the number of Hermite functions during the HF simulations. The main idea is that a HF simulation starts using only
four AW Hermite polynomials and solving only the ﬁrst four equations of the system (7). In
other words, at the beginning the model is equivalent to a ﬂuid model with a particular closure
C4 = 0 (akin to Grad’s famous thirteen moment method [7]). Then the number of moments
s
s
NH
is changed dynamically during the simulation. If the maximum value of |CN
| for difH −1
ferent Fourier components is greater than a threshold value, the number of Hermite functions
is increased and more equations are solved per time step. In addition, if the maximum value of
|CNH −1 | for diﬀerent Fourier components is less than a threshold value, the number of Hermite
functions is decreased and fewer equations are solved. Thus, this technique is based on a double
threshold. In summary, we start a simulation with four Hermite modes (ﬂuid description) and
then we add/remove Hermite polynomials to the calculations according to this rule:
+
s
s
- add one Hermite mode if
max(|CN
|) > C0,0
Htol
H −1,k
− ,
s
s
- remove one Hermite mode if max(|CNH −1,k |) < C0,0 Htol

(18)

where C0,0 is the 0-th order expansion coeﬃcient which is proportional to the average density,
+
−
and Htol
are the threshold values, and max represents the maximum value among all
Htol
Fourier modes. This new technique naturally links near-Maxwellian (i.e. few moments) to
non-Maxwellian behavior of the plasma by adaptively increasing the number of Hermite modes
present in the system.

Results

In this section we present results from two test simulations: the Landau damping and twostream instability. These are two common tests for kinetic plasma simulations and are chosen
to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the new adaptive choice of Hermite functions. Tests are
carried out using a Fortran code. The Fortran language was chosen for the primitive support
of complex number type. The computer system used for the tests in use consists of Intel 2.2
GHz processor and 8GB RAM memory. The GNU Fortran 4.9.2 compiler was used.

Landau Damping

Landau damping is an important resonance phenomenon between plasma particles and a wave
[16]: the excited wave provides energy to resonant particles and is damped, while the resonant
particles increase their kinetic energy. A correct description of Landau damping is only possible
using the kinetic approach. The goal of this test is to show that the HF method starts from a
ﬂuid description of the plasma using only four Hermite modes and rapidly increases its number
1153

Spectral Solver for Multi-Scale Plasma PhysicsVencels, Delzanno, Johnson, Peng, Laure and Markidis

to capture the kinetic eﬀects. By switching from ﬂuid to kinetic approach during the simulation,
the correct value of Landau damping rate is calculated.
In the initial set-up, ions are uniformly distributed along the spatial domain, while electrons
are perturbed according √
to Eq. (19) with n0 = 1. Other parameters are mi /me = 1836,
αi = 2/1836 and αe = 2. 25 Fourier modes are used and the collisional parameter is set to

end of the simulation we observe an ion acoustic wave. Although the ion acoustic wave was not
initially set, it was exited by ion interaction with electrons.
The red lines in Figure 2 represent the number of Hermite modes for electrons (dotted line)
and ions (full line). At the beginning of the simulation the number of modes grows rapidly for
electrons. This indicates that the kinetic approach must be used. At t = 13 ωp−1 the number of
modes for electrons reaches the maximum value 139, while the number of modes for ions grows
slowly during the simulation. At the end of the simulation, electrons use 87 Hermite modes
and ions only 7 Hermite modes. We compared the number of maximum Hermite modes for
diﬀerent collisional frequencies and found that the collisional term reduces it.

Two-stream Instability

The two-stream instability occurs between two counter-streaming electron beams. In this instability, the kinetic energy of the beams is converted into potential energy. We use two electron
species with oppositely directed beam velocity. In the initial set-up, each electrons species is
perturbed according to Eq. (19) with n0 = 0.5. Other parameters are αe = 0.5 for both elec1154

Results for the two-stream instability test are shown in Figure 3. The black line represents

simulation is in agreement with the linear theory results γ = 0.185 (dashed line). From t = 0 to
t ≈ 40 ωp−1 the two-stream instability is in the linear stage. In this regime interaction between
beams is weak and the number of modes grows slowly. For t > 40 ωp−1 the number of modes
grows rapidly until at t = 53 ωp−1 it reaches the maximum value. At this point plasma has
reached the non-linear regime. The red line represents the number of Hermite modes for each
electron species. The number of modes for each species after t = 53 ωp−1 is 195 and does not
change afterwards.

Performance

The automatic choice of the number of Hermite modes allows to accurately describe a given
plasma phenomenon, since it ensures that there are enough Hermite modes to describe the
relevant kinetic eﬀects. The original implementation of the HF method used a ﬁxed number of
Hermite modes. Hence we deﬁne the Hermite mode saving factor:

equal to the maximum number obtained for the adaptive simulation: N Href

1155

Spectral Solver for Multi-Scale Plasma PhysicsVencels, Delzanno, Johnson, Peng, Laure and Markidis

The parameter is computed at each simulation cycle and represents theoretical time savings
from the adaptive approach. Similarly, we deﬁne the computational saving factor as:
%CP U =

tref − tadapt
· 100,
tref

(21)

where tref and tadapt are computation time for the reference and the adaptive simulations.
Eﬃciency of our new implementation is demonstrated in Figure 4 (a) for the Landau damping test. Although the adaptive approach requires additional computations to compare expansion coeﬃcients with the thresholds, the CPU saving factor matches the Hermite modes saving
factor which follows from smaller problem size and faster convergence of the nonlinear solver.
The use of the adaptive number of Hermite modes results in a simulation that takes 46.7 s. The
reference simulation using ﬁxed number of Hermite modes takes 56.3 s. The adaptive technique
leads to a 21% overall time reduction while memory consumption is 11 MB for both simulations
(the adaptive technique uses preallocated memory).
For the two-stream instability test, CPU and number of Hermite modes saving factors are
shown in Figure 4 (b). As in the Landau damping test, the CPU saving factor matches the
Hermite mode saving factor. The highest speed-up is at the beginning of the simulation where
a reduced number of modes allows to run the simulation up to 10 times faster than the reference
simulation. The total computation time for adaptive simulation is 58 s versus 110 s for reference
simulation. This leads to 47% overall time reduction compared to the reference simulation time
while memory consumption does not change and is 9 MB.

Discussion and Conclusions

This paper proposes improvements to a spectral method for plasma simulations. We ﬁrst showed
that the HF method combines the ﬂuid and kinetic approaches into one framework. The ﬁrst
three Hermite moment equations correspond to the ﬂuid equations. Second, we presented
a new technique to adjust the number of Hermite functions during the simulation to switch
between near-Maxwellian and non-Maxwellian behavior. The technique is applied to the Landau
damping and two-stream instability test problems. Performance results show the eﬀectiveness of
the new technique. Future work will focus on the extension of the adaptive technique to perform

automatic choice of the parameters αs and us in Eq. (6). Extensions to the three-dimensional
fully electromagnetic case is also planned.
