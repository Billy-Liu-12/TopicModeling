Abstract
The present study aims to explore the quantum topological features of the electron density and its
Laplacian of the understudied molecular bromine species involved in ozone depletion events. The
characteristics of the C-Br and O-Br bonds have been analyzed via quantum theory of atoms in
molecules (QTAIM) analysis using the wave functions computed at the B3LYP/aug-cc-PVTZ level of
theory. Quantum topology analysis reveal that the C-Br and O-Br bonds show depletion of charge
density indicating the increased ionic character of these bonds. Contour plots and relief maps have been
analyzed for regions of valence shell charge concentrations (VSCC) and depletions (VSCD) in the
ground state.
Key words: quantum topology-bromine bonds-QTAIM-Laplacian of electron density

1. Introduction
Ozone-loss events [1,2] in the troposphere and stratosphere have been shown recently to result from
the role played by some bromine containing species. The photophysics[3]of the decomposition of these
species is understudied. Bromine chemistry has been recognized to play a significant role in the
stratospheric ozone budget and in the Arctic troposphere during ozone-loss events. Predicting the
relative stabilities and reactivities of various bromine species are crucial factors in understanding the
ultrafast decomposition/isomerisation dynamics of brominated species in polar regions. In fact the
nature and bonding characteristics of bromine bonds are not, at a fundamental level, well understood.
The present study aims to explore the quantum chemical topological features of the electron density and
its Laplacian for the X-Br (X=C or O) bonds. The quantum theory of atoms in a molecule [4] will be
used throughout this work.

2. Method of Calculations
All quantum chemical calculations carried out in the present work were performed using the Gaussian
09 suite of programs [5]. Full geometry optimizations for each species studied have been carried out at
the DFT/B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory [6, 7] Chemical bonds were studied and characterized at
the QTAIM level of theory [4]. Topological analysis and the evaluation of local properties were
performed with AIMII software [8] using the wave functions calculated at aug-cc-pVTZlevel.

3. Results and Discussion
Quantum Chemical Topology Analyses
In this work, the QTAIM theory is used to analyze the characteristics of the C-Br and O-Br bonds and
their cooperative effect. Details of the QTAIM is well documented elsewhere.[9,10] Topological
analysis of the Laplacian of the electron charge density provides a powerful tool to investigate the
electronic and conformational properties of the molecules and allows much better insight into the
interatomic interactions.

In our discussion of the nature of the bromine bonds, several different topological parameters will be
analyzed and discussed. The most important of which are the Laplacian at the critical points, and the
total energy density, H(r), which may be defined as the sum of the kinetic, G(r) and potential, V(r),
energy densities both computed at critical point.[11,12]
Figure 1 displays molecular graphs for the bromine-containing species studied in this work. These
molecular graphs reveal that the isomerization / tautomerization processes are not just a geometric
change but it also affects the electron density topology and bonding pattern. Thus for example, the cistrans isomerization of HCOBr is not only a geometry change Thus, the O-Br interaction shows a marked
depletion of the electron charge density from the bonding regions in the cis- isomer and much greater
contribution of the Br atom dipole towards the O-Br bond. The O-C interaction shows the same trend
where electron density is depleted from the C-O bond region and accumulated in the nonbonding
regions. Tables 1 and 2 collects the topological properties of the electronic density computed at the
position of the bond critical points for the O-Br and C-Br bonds, for the species studied in the present
work.
It is interesting to discuss the values of 2U(r) at CP’s. The Laplacian at the BCP is given by
2U(r) at BCP = O1 + O2 + O3
where Oi’s are the three curvatures of the density at the cp’s, , O1 and O2, are perpendicular to the bond
path and are negative (_O1 _ > _O2 _) whereas O3, is positive lies along the bond path. The negative
curvature measures the extent of concentration of the electron charge density along a bond path.
Whereas, positive curvature accounts for the depletion of electron density from the inter-atomic surface
to the individual atomic basins. It is evident from Tables 1 and 2 that all BCP’s for the C-Br bond paths
show 2U(r) ‹ 0 indicating accumulation of the electron density in the region between the two bonded
atoms. This is also true for the BCP’s of O-Br in the isomeric system CH3OBr/CH3BrO. The O-Br bond
in CH3OBr shows the largest negative 2U(r) value (-1.16197 au) indicating its pure covalent character.
On the other hand, C-Br bonds show very small 2U(r) value ( -0.01 au) indicating the increased ionic
character of this bond. On the other hand, the 2U(r) value of this bond in case of CH3BrO is 10 times
more negative. 2U(r) for the O-Br bonds in case of OBr, HCOBr (cis and trans) and HOBr are all
positive indicating that the electron density is depleted away from the bonding regions.

Now let us look at the energy density of these bonds. The ratio _V_/G is very illustrative in this respect.
Thus, _V_/G  1 corresponds to weak interaction. In the present case, the C-Br bonds seem to be of strong
covalent character and of comparable strength. On the other hand, the energy density of the O-Br bond
is of varying magnitude indicating that the nature of this bond depends greatly on its environment. Thus,
in case of CH3OBr the energy density of the O-Br bond is relatively much higher than that in any other
species studied and more than three times its value in the isomeric compound CH 3BrO. It is very
illustrative to compare the energy density values of the O-Br bonds for the cis- and trans-HCOBr. For
the cis- isomer the energy density is ! 1 indicating a strong interaction whereas, its value for the transisomer is  1 which is consistent with the stability order of these two molecules.

Two more indices would shed light on the bonding characteristics, namely bond ellipticity and
delocalization index. Bond ellipticity, H, measures the extent to which density is preferentially
accumulated in a given plane containing the bond path. The ellipticity is defined as:
H = (O1/O2) - 1
where (_O1_ t _ O2_ )
If (_O1_ = _ O2_ then H = 0, and the bond is cylindrically symmetrical. Large H values indicate structural
instability and vice versa. Both C-Br and O-Br bonds show H values, which are reasonably small
indicating the stable character of binding and probably weak involvement of the Br d-orbitals in bonding
in these regions. The delocalization index DI(A,B) elaborates on these bonding nature.

Figure 2 displays plots of 2U(r) in the molecular plan of CH3OBr and CH3BrO. The dotted contour
lines in figure 2a correspond to regions of local charge concentration. Note the concentration of charge
on and around oxygen atoms. This is probably more evident in the relief maps displayed in figure 2b.
Figure 2b displays relief maps of the Laplacian of the electron density in the plane of the nuclei. The
image has been inverted that is, the nuclear maxima are pointing downwards and are terminated at 4 au.
Note the presence of “saddles” in the density between bonded atoms. The dominant topological feature
is the presence of maxima at the positions of the nuclei. The maxima pointing upwards are those due to
accumulation of charge in the bonding regions. In these map oxygen atoms show the widest
accumulation of charge and there are in addition to the maxima at the nuclear positions, accumulation
of charge in the bonding regions. The distribution of these maxima in the valence shell charge
concentration (VSCC) reveals tight binding and polarization of the charge density.
For the isomeric system CH3OBr/BrCH2OH, although the C-O bond shows considerable charge transfer
yet there exists residual valence density on C. This imparts significant ‘back polarization’ to C resulting
in a near vanishing dipole moment. This is the reason why the charge distribution of neither C nor O
approaches their “ionic limit. This topological feature is not evident in CH 3BrO or the other brominecontaining species studied.
The electron density topological features for the O and the bromine atoms are quite different. Thus, for
Br , the dotted red contour lines are concentrated around the nucleus which represent regions of negative
electron density followed by a symmetric set of blue contour lines indicating regions of the VSCD and
then two green zones seems to be perpendicular to the Br-C (or O) bond path where positive holes are
observed. These positive holes around the Br atom may very well be the quantum chemical topology
description of what is known as σ-holes. A σ-hole is a region of positive electrostatic potential on the
extension of a covalent bonds to a group IV–VII atom [13-15]. For the O atom, no such positive holes
are detected and the negative regions of the electron density extend far from the nucleus and show
regions of VSCC in the C-O bonding regions. The electron density of the lone pairs of the O atoms
shows much greater extension in space, however.
