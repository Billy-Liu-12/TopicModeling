Abstract
Numerical methods are tools for approximating solutions to problems that may have complicated
developments or cannot be solved analytically. In engineering courses, students must address
problems related other disciplines such as structural or rock mechanics, biology, chemistry or physics.
Prior to solving these problems it is important to define and adopt a rational framework. The students
of fourth course out of five, of the bachelor’s degree in Computer Sciences or Industrial Engineering at
the University of Salamanca (Spain), they learn mathematics solving real problems with the help of
the already acquired interdisciplinary knowledge. We have proposed the students a term project that
summarizes some of the knowledge and competences acquired during the lessons. We will describe in
this study the software and specific applications that will be use during the whole course.
Keywords: Numerical methods, Simulink, differential equations, assessment

1 Introduction
Contrary to students’ belief, mathematics is rich in applications to the modern and real world
(Mustoe & Croft, 1999); (Brown, 2001). There is a need to convince students that mathematics is a
relevant and living subject, with exciting applications in different areas of activity which affect their
daily lives. Using mathematical tools, engineering students can look forward to a wide range of
working fields in emerging technologies and modern application areas.
The ability to use the computer is an important part of the Numerical Methods course. In order to
make students develop their own self-learning capabilities, they must produce a written and an oral
presentation which analyzes an issue that requires the use of knowledge and competences acquired
during the course. Matlab program is one of the preferred software for engineers. It is a language for
technical computing that includes an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are

expressed in familiar mathematical notation (Sen & Shaykhian, 2009); (Higham & Higham, 2005). At
our campus (University of Salamanca), learners can take advantage of the computer labs located at the
School and faculty buildings, where Matlab is installed on each of the machines and could be used to
solve all mathematical proposed problems (Ibrahim, 2011).
The Numerical Methods course presents numerical methods, including their implementation into
computers, and their application to the solution of some problems such as equilibrium of solids, heat
transfer or water seepage through soils. The main topics goes from an initial overview of different
numerical methods for one variable functions, to partial differential equations and finite elements
method.
To assess students learning process, they have different homework assigned weekly that must be
done in a defined period of time. The homework lies in solving some problems and questionnaires
using Matlab or making them handwritten. As part of the learning process, the virtual learning
environment that we use as a corporative tool, supposes a great advantage, providing powerful
capabilities for learning (Luminita, 2011).
As a final task, at the end of the course, a term project must be delivered by each student. The
project provides the students the opportunity to improve different skills, which probably have not been
completely developed in the habitual frame of the traditional education. Moreover fourth course
students have a broad knowledge of physics, electricity, electronic or computer sciences, and also in
software design and development, and they are able to apply their knowledge to the project.
Engineering students use to separate the matters in self-contained compartments, so they could not
see the relation between mathematics, electricity installations, process engineering, or material
structures for example. There are several publications about specific tools for engineering, see for
example the virtual campus for Biomedical Engineering (Kybartaite, Nousiainen, & Malmivuo, 2013),
a software application used for the study of heat transfer problems (Jancov, Charvtov, Kolomaznk, &
Fialka, 2013), a computer based educational tool for DC–DC converters (Kayisli, Tuncer, & Poyraz,
2013), and so on. This paper tries to put together both: the computer tools and the mathematical
competences and abilities to obtain the solutions of some numerical methods’ problems. We present a
case study about a second-order ordinary differential equation that models a population evolution.
This paper is organized as follows: the Numerical Methods’ course outline is detailed in Section 2.
Section 3 is dedicated to the project proposal where students should choose the right tool. The
assessment process is shown in Section 4, and finally, Section 5 draws the conclusions.

2 Numerical Methods: Course Outline
The Numerical Methods subject at the Computer Sciences Faculty and Industrial Engineering
School at the University of Salamanca is a course in differential equations. Its goal is to find the
solutions of equations involving derivatives of functions. Students will study:
x First order differential equations;
x Second-order differential equations;
x Applications in engineering and models;
x Partial Differential Equations.
There are no defined pre-requisites for this course, but students should have good grounding in
differentiation and theory of integration, and they should have acquired sufficient basic integration
skills. Some of the objectives of this course are:
1. Write and clearly express the mathematical notation;
2. Use computer technology to solve differential equations and interpret their results;
3. Acquire the needed knowledge about differential equations as a problem-solving tool;
4. Find solutions of quadratic linear differential equations and also first order;
5. Use different methods: numerical, graphical, and symbolic to solve problems;

Find answers to real-world problems applying the new mathematical knowledge of
differential equations.
After successfully completing this course the students should achieve the following competences:
1. First-order differential equations:
a. Find the solution to linear first-order equations.
b. Solve initial value problems.
c. Determine whether a given first-order initial value problem has a unique solution.
d. Apply the knowledge to model motion, financial scenarios, population growth, and
other physical or real phenomena.
2. Second-order differential equations:
a. Learn how to face given second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with
constant coefficients.
b. Use different methods to familiarize with the solution, in case of linear
inhomogeneous differential equations.
3. Numerical methods:
a. Use Euler, Taylor, and Runge-Kutta methods to get the approximate solutions of
first-order differential equations.
b. Use up to date specialized mathematical software to get an approximate solutions of
single differential equations or systems of differential equations.
c. Determine the difficulty of a problem based on the solution.
4. Partial Differential Equations:
a. Discretization techniques for elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential
equations. Analysis of advanced numerical methods in this area.
b. The finite element methods: techniques to find the approximate solution.
Some of the recommended bibliography to learn more about the subject is (Chapra & Canale,
2007), and (Lambert, 1991).
One of the great advantages of this subject is that it has a lot of interdisciplinary applications.
Students from engineering courses are more motivated when they find the connection between topics
from different subjects. As an example, authors from (Marchand & McDevitt, 1999) use the
differential equations course to explore the mechanical vibrations of buildings during an earthquake.

3 Case Study: Project Proposal
Each learner group (or single student) must prepare a project that includes a paper and a
presentation. The topic of the proposal and its development in such an assignment must be an
engineering application concerning differential equations.
This case study is about the second-order ordinary differential equation that models a population
evolution. In this case, students propose a problem, related to some ecosystems that can support a
maximum population of PM individuals of a certain species. The ecosystem, initially, it has a
population of N0 = 1/5 PM, while the growth rate is 1/20 PM individuals per month. At this moment an
“explosion of population” takes place that affects the environmental balance so that the population
exceeds PM. Since the ecosystem does not support such situations there is a population decline that
finally end up with declining oscillations around the value PM.
The aim of the problem is to calculate the population, N(t), and to find the maximum value reaches
by N(t) together with the point in time when it occurs.
Sometimes an ad hoc software development process is the appropriate. In fact, if the proposed
report is small or noncritical, the use of a formal methodology may not be justified. The first challenge
is to understand and define the work to be carried out.
To face the proposed problem, the student suggests several distinct stages:

To define the requirements.
To analyze the possible solution, trying to find the model of that kind of problems.
To analyze and select between the different tools, the suitable one to solve the proposed
situation.
Implementation with Matlab or Mathematica.
To look for other applications for the same problem.

3.1 Requirements
Every problem of numerical method usually has the same requirements: the solution we are
looking for must be close to the exact one. Another requirement should be that the software
development is as much efficient as possible with a good error processing.
With such short problem, the organized set of techniques that students considered as a method is
targeted to achieve the objective, which means, in this case, the solution of the real problem. Wijers
(Wijers, 1991) realized that, often, a method is focused on specifications practically feasible instead on
how to carry out those specifications.
In the proposed projects the requirements where:
1. To find a suitable software to get the solution of the problem.
2. To develop an efficient programme to solve second-order ordinary differential equations
(sometime this is already implemented in the mathematical software).
3. Test the program to be sure that it works properly for that kind of problems.

3.2 Find the Model of the Physical Situation
Numerous applications in engineering can be found related to and modelled by second-order linear
differential equations, like the vibration of springs or electric circuits and modes ecological,
biochemical, and compartmental systems in biology.
An “explosion” as the one mentioned in this case study, can be modelled by the equation:
݀2ܰ
݀‫ݐ‬2

݀ܰ
݀‫ݐ‬

5

+ 4 ܰ = 4 ܲ‫ ܯ‬,

(1)

where N is the number of individuals, t is time in months, and PM the maximum population of
individuals as was indicated at the problem formulation.
A second-order linear differential equation has the general form:
݀2‫ݕ‬

݀‫ݕ‬

‫݌‬1 (‫ ݔ݀ )ݔ‬2 + ‫݌‬2 (‫ ݔ݀ )ݔ‬+ ‫݌‬3 (‫)ݔ(݂ = ݕ)ݔ‬,

(2)

where p1, p2 and p3 are continuous functions in x. The case where f (x) = 0 is called homogeneous
linear equations. When ݂(‫ ് )ݔ‬0 (for some x), like Equation (2), is called nonhomogeneous.
In case of second-order Equation (2), an initial value problem (IVP) is to find a solution to the
differential equation that satisfies some conditions, called initial conditions like:
‫ݔ(ݕ‬0 ) = ‫ݕ‬0 ,

‫ݕ‬Ԣ(‫ݔ‬0 ) = ‫ݕ‬1 ,

considering y0 and y1 given constants. If p1, p2, p3 and f in Equation (2) are differentiable on an
interval and ‫݌‬1 (‫ ് )ݔ‬0 there, then the Picard theorem (Mathews & Fink, 2004) -that was previously
explained in classes as part of the course syllabus- ensures that the solution exists and it is unique to
this IVP.

With the Equation (1), the following initial conditions are considered:

At this point, students try to find a numerical handwritten solution, to be sure that they find the
right software that leads to the correct solution, this is what they found:

Maximum value is t = 3.09 months, with N (3.09) = 1.167 PM.

3.3 Selection of the Suitable Tool
We have considered a computer-based application as a suitable tool that supports the use of a
modelling technique. Such a tool includes modelling functionalities that allow the object
transformation from real systems into models, checking the possible models to get the most adequate
and consistent, changing results from one model and representation to another if it is needed and
providing specifications to review previous results (Olle, Sol, & MacDonald, 1991).
Most of the time students choose Matlab as the tool to carry out the project, because a campus
license provides Matlab and add-on tools for academic research and curriculum development at the
University of Salamanca.
The students that go forward with the project mentioned in this paper have used Matlab during
their Automation course and they realized that a block design is useful to test the solution of the
problem (see Figure 1) and they also get a graphical representation of the solution (see Figure 2).

Figure 1: Block design with Matlab Simulink.

3.4 Implementation using Matlab
To obtain symbolic solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODE), some students try to define
and implement a function, but it is easy to find the Matlab command dsolve that computes easily and

1981

Araceli Queiruga Dios, Ascensi´

faster the solution sought (Moler & Costa, 1997). If dsolve command is used, to denote differentiation
inside the equations, we use symbolic expressions containing the letter D. In that situation, D2, D3, ...,
DN, correspond with the second, third, ..., and Nth derivative, respectively. Thus, D2y is the term
corresponding to d2 y/dt 2 . In those expressions, the dependent variables are preceded by D and the
independent variable is t. The independent variable can be changed to a different symbolic variable if
we include that variable as the last input argument. Initial conditions, as always, can be specified by
additional equations. If we considered an ODE without initial conditions, the solution contains
constants of integration, A, B, etc.

Figure 2: The Scope block displays its input with respect to simulation time. If we open the
Scope after a simulation, the graphical representation of the solution will be displayed.

The output from dsolve is similar to the output from solve. That is, you can call dsolve with the
number of output variables equal to the number of dependent variables or place the output in a
structure whose fields contain the solutions of the differential equations (MathWorks, 2010).
In what follows, we considered the second-order differential equation (1), with two initial
conditions given at (4). The default independent variable changes to t in the answer. The command
dsolve ('D2y+Dy+5/4*y=5/4', 'y(0) = 1/5, Dy (0) = 1/20')
produces
ans = - 7/20*exp(-1/2*t)*sin(t) – 4/5 *exp(-1/2 *t) * cos(t) +1.

3.5 Other Applications
Second-order linear differential equations are widely used in science in general, and engineering as
a particular case, because there are a lot of applications that can be found in real-world and daily jobs.
The case of vibrating springs considers the motion of an object (with a given mass) at the end of a
spring, like the one shown in Figure 3a).

The mass spring mechanism is governed by a second-order linear differential equation:

where x(t) is considered as the displacement from the equilibrium position, the value of m is the object
mass, ߤ is the damping factor, k the spring constant, and f(t) the external restoring force. The proposed
problem is to find the displacement and vibration for the different values of ߤ, k and f.

Students were able to use second-order ODE to solve electric circuits’ problems that include a
resistor R, an inductor L, a capacitor C, and a battery or generator that generate an electromotive force
E in series, like Figure 3b). If we consider Q = Q (t) as the capacitor's charge at time t, then the current
is I = dQ/dt, i.e., the rate of change of Q with respect to t. It is known from Kirchhoffs voltage law that
the equation that models those kind of circuits is Equation (2) with p1(x) = L, p2(x) = R, p3(x) = 1/C,
and f(x) = E(t), a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. We can add the
initial conditions Q(0) = Q0, Q’(0) = I (0) = I0, when charge Q0 and the current I0 are known at time 0.

4 The Assessment Process
For The evaluation is not only the final act of the instruction process or as mere mechanism of
classification and selection of the students. The assessment method is considered as the basic platform
for the direction of the learning process of the students and their self-training (autonomous learning). It
allows us to learn from our own practice and to improve our system of education, that is to say,
investigation in the teaching action.

The course evaluation, broadly speaking can be characterized as the set of activities that lead to
emit a judgment on a student based on criteria previously established in the subject.
It is necessary to notice that we consider the assessment as a part of the teaching-learning process,
not something external or addition artificially to this process.
When finalizing the course, teachers must judge the degree of learning with a mark. The judgment
that is tried of this evaluation is global, non-specific: it informs if the student has passed or not the
course. With this information the student is on the one hand credited before the society and on the
other, the evaluation indicates the difficulty degree whereupon student is going away. In this study,
we present one part of the activities that contributes to the final assessment. We have proposed the
students, as part of the final mark (40 percent of the grade) to find an example or application of the
subject to the real life, to develop a research carried out using the information available at the Internet
and the software Matlab.

5 Conclusions
The students developing any term project should question the knowledge and competences
acquired during the course and look at it from a different perspective. As future engineers, it is
expected that students work deeper to understand the situations and problems that they will find in
their daily work. In order to do so, it is necessary to develop certain skills and competences, and
remember learned issues during their studies in the research field.
This paper outlines the competences, knowledge and tools that an engineer must put into practice
in a specific field. This study has analyzed one specific problem: a second-order ordinary differential
equation that models a population evolution. We showed some different ways to understand it: like a
transfer function in a block diagram or the function that defines the motion of vibrating springs, or the
voltage in an RLC circuit.
The problem solving applied to the resolution of differential equations, using mathematical
software makes the work much easier and enjoyable. The use of this assessment method allows to
check how well learners are progressing through the math curriculum.
