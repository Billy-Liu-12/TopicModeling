Abstract
Due to the complexity and crucial role of an Emergency Department(ED) in the healthcare
system. The ability to more accurately represent, simulate and predict performance of ED
will be invaluable for decision makers to solve management problems. One way to realize
this requirement is by modeling and simulating the emergency department, the objective of
this research is to design a simulator, in order to better understand the bottleneck of ED
performance and provide ability to predict such performance on deﬁned condition. Agent-based
modeling approach was used to model the healthcare staﬀ, patient and physical resources in ED.
This agent-based simulator provides the advantage of knowing the behavior of an ED system
from the micro-level interactions among its components. The model was built in collaboration
with healthcare staﬀ in a typical ED and has been implemented and veriﬁed in a Netlogo
modeling environment. Case studies are provided to present some capabilities of the simulator
in quantitive analysis ED behavior and supporting decision making. Because of the complexity
of the system, high performance computing technology was used to increase the number of
studied scenarios and reduce execution time.

Introduction and Related Work

An emergency department (ED), also known as accident & emergency (A&E), emergency room
(ER), or casualty department, is a medical treatment facility specializing in acute care of
patients who present without prior appointment, either by their own means or by ambulance,

some of which may be life-threatening and must be treated quickly. Such that, ED must
operate to provide 24/7 year-round service. Since Emergency Department(ED) is the main
entrance to a healthcare system that faces uncertainty everyday. The Eﬃciency and Quality
of Service(QoS) in ED have big inﬂuence on the whole healthcare system. Making decisions
under multi-constraint to meet uncertainty is a big challenge for ED managers.
Modeling and simulation provide a quantitive way to analyze the behavior and predict the
performance of an ED. There have been fruitful eﬀorts in developing simulation models for
solving healthcare management problems [2], [6], [11]. Traditional simulation methods, for
example the empirical data based queuing model, can provide the overall behavior of ED, e.g.
[8] and [13]. Whereas Boudreaux et al.[4] reviewed literatures on patient satisfaction study
in ED. Contrary to popular belief, research has repeatedly shown that actual waiting times
and overall length of stay are relatively unimportant in determining satisfaction. What does
seem to be important, however, is the patient’s subjective experience of the waiting time.
This means how satisﬁed the patient is with interpersonal interactions with ED physicians and
nurses. Therefore, the detailed interaction information is more important to evaluate policies
for improving QoS. Due to the complexity of ED system and the importance of interaction
information in ED, modeling an ED should not account for unique individuals who are located
in a highly detailed environment, but struggle to represent the processes and dynamics that
drive the healthcare service and ultimately lead to system level performance representing. One
technique that shows considerable promise for this requirement is agent-based modeling(ABM).
An agent-based model is comprised of autonomous, decision making entities called agents
that have the ability to interact with each other and with the environment they stay in. The goal
of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple
rules and interacting in a shared environment. Through this mechanism, the methodology is
able to account for the low-level interactions that drive a system directly, rather than predict
system behavior at an aggregate level. The other important advantage is that it provides for
construction of models in the absence of knowledge about the global interdependencies [3].
In this study, spatial agent-based modeling approach was used to model the interaction
between patients, healthcare staﬀ and physical resources in ED. The model was designed by
cooperating with the Hospital of Sabadell. It is one of the biggest hospitals in Catalunya,
Spain, which provides care service to a catchment area of about 500,000 people, receiving over
160,000 patients annually in its ED. They use a triage and acuity scale similar to the Canadian
one to determine the priority of patients’ treatments based on the severity of their condition.
The severity of patients is classiﬁed into ﬁve levels: 1-resuscitation, 2-emergent, 3-urgent, 4less urgent and 5-non urgent [10]. Moreover, triage results of one patient will determine the
order and priority with which the patient must be attended and the treatment area where they
will be treated. Patients with lower acuity level always have higher priority to get service and
physical resources. In this way, the ED of this hospital has two areas, A and B. Area A is
occupied by the most urgent patients and is made up of careboxes. Patients attended in area
A will stay in their own carebox during all the diagnosis and treatment process. Area B is for
patients with an acuity level of 4 and 5, there are several attention boxes in which doctors and
nurses interact with patients, and a large waiting room in which all patients will remain while
not having interaction with the ED staﬀ. These two areas have their own doctor and nurse
who work separately but share the same test service resources, for example X-Ray, CT-scan,
ultrasonography, laboratorys test and so on. We obtain the record data from this hospital to
verify and validate the model.
This research is a continuity of research work published in WSC 2012[5] and ICCS 2013 [12].
Their work contributed to simulate area B of ED which is speciﬁed for non-urgent patients.

patients) and the lowest on Thursday(306 patients). The average daily arrival is about 329,
around 30% of them came with urgent condition(with auity level 1, 2 and 3) and received
medical service in area A(see Figure 2).
Output The output of an agent-based simulator includes two parts, (1) interaction informations of all agents, which we deﬁne as a format of ﬁve Ws (who, what, when, where, why) and
one H(how long it takes). (2) The state information of ED environment, such as the number
of waiting patients, utilization of physical resources, occupation of healthcare staﬀ.
In this way, the simulator does not directly provide the information about the behavior
of simulated ED, whereas, cross analyzing through diﬀerent simulation scenario is the way to
obtain information.

2.2

Agent Deﬁnition

Without loss of generality, we deﬁned two types of agents, active and passive, to represent
all components of ED, human and physical resources. Namely, active agents, including all
the healthcare staﬀs and patients who can interact with active agents or passive agents and
move around ED purposely. Passive represents all the physical resources in ED. Passive agents
can only interact with active agents passively. The healthcare staﬀ considered in this study
include: admission staﬀ, triage nurse, doctor and nurse in both areas, auxiliary staﬀ. The
physical resources we considered include: information system, test rooms(X-Ray, CT-scan et
al.), laboratory tests, carebox in area A, chairs in areaB, waiting rooms and ambulance for
departure. The active agents are autonomous, decision making entities which directly represent
the healthcare staﬀs’ behavior. These active agents are deﬁned with a set of behaviors and
decision rules. We assume all the agent always follow the decision rules deﬁned for them, they
can only behave as what we deﬁned in their behavior set. The agents’ behavior is deﬁned at
an individual level, a behavior set of the healthcare staﬀ determine the kind of service they can
provide. In execution, all the agents follow their own behavior rules, move around purposely
to interact with agents as well as the environment. These individual behavior result in time
elapsing and state transferring. The behavior of ED is emerged as a result of these interactions.

2.3

Healthcare Staﬀ Behavior

Healthcare staﬀ in an ED are service providers, admission staﬀ and triage nurses are easy to
model because they provide service to patient one by one with First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
order. Doctors and nurses in the treatment zone are more complicated because they need to
take care of several patients simultaneously with considering patients’ acuity level, and for each
patient, they need to provide diﬀerent services under diﬀerent physical conditions of a patient.
Modeling these services is almost equivalent to modeling these diﬀerent interactions.
In real situations, the Information System(IS) is working as a central task dispatcher, which
drives the ED forward. For example, when a doctor assigns a test service for a patient, the
IS will allocate one auxiliary to help the patient move to the corresponding test room, when
ﬁnished, the auxiliary sends the patient back to their carebox. When the test service provider
gets the test result, they will send the result to IS, and IS will forward to the corresponding
doctor’s task-list. The doctor will perform the task according to predeﬁned order rules. The
central information system helps to cooperate these multitasks which drive all the healthcare
staﬀ forward. The model of the healthcare staﬀ can be abstracted as a passive task executor
as shown in Figure 3 , each healthcare staﬀ has a task-list, the IS post tasks to their task-list.
Length of Stay(LoS) is one of the most important indexes of QoS for patients and eﬃciency
of ED. Therefore, the length of time for each service process should be carefully modeled. We

In Table 3, with an increasing number of arrival patients, some of the resource utilization
increases dramatically. When daily arrival patients increases to 456(140% of normal) per day,
the ED becomes saturated and faces serious overcrowding problem in area B. The LoS of patient
increases a lot, especially patients with acuity level 5 in area B, their LoS having almost doubled.
This is because the laboratory test service is saturated and patients with acuity level 5 have
the lowest priority to get the resources. In this case, assuming that the ED manager proposes
a solution to add two more technicians to work in the laboratory test room (Trlab = 6). To test
and evaluate the proposal solution, we simulate this new resource conﬁguration by modifying
the ED resources conﬁguration in Table 2, the result was shown in Table 4.

From Table 4, we can see that after adding two more technicians to the laboratory test
room, the laboratory utilization decreased dramatically and LoS of type 5 patient was reduced
to normal. But when the patient arrival rate keep rising, say 150% times of normal rate, patients
with acuity level 3 in area A were seriously saturated because they have the lowest priority to
get access to resources. Through resource utilization information, it is easy to ﬁnd the reason,
the doctors in area A were saturated. Having said that, one of the direct solutions should be
to assign more doctors to area A. The manager can simulate this proposal solution(Trlab = 6,
sDA = 5, and jDa = 3) to evaluate its eﬀect. The simulation results were shown in Table 5.

Through simulating the proposal solution, we can see that the solution can solve the overcrowding problem in some degree. Moreover, if the patient arrival keeps increasing, the doctor

in area B may become the next latent bottleneck.

3.3

Inﬂuence of Ambulance

As shown in Section 2.4, when a patient asked the ambulance service for departure, the patient
continue to use the treatment place during the ambulance’s response time period. Moving on
from here, the ambulance’s response time has some inﬂuence on the behavior of ED, causing
overcrowding or worsing overcrowding. The LoS of their following patients will also be increased
because they have to wait longer for a free treatment place. To quantitatively analyze the inﬂuence, we simulate two more scenarios based on the saturated scenario in Table 4. In this
saturated scenario, when daily arrival increased to 496(150% of normal value), the ED meets
serious overcrowding even with two more technicians have been added to the laboratory test
room. Here, we simulate and consider the inﬂuence of ambulance response time for departure.
In the ﬁrst scenario, we use half of the actual ambulance response time described in Section
2.4. In the second scenario, we assume the response time is zero(the ambulance always arrived
immediately). We simulate to see if the response time of ambulance can alleviate the overcrowding problem. Patients’ LoS under these two simulated scenarios are shown in Table 6.
The overcrowding problem has been lessened with decrease of the ambulances’ response time.

In Table 6, we can see how the response time of ambulance has an inﬂuence on the ED
behavior. The reason is that during the waiting period, the patient continue to use the treatment
place(carebox in area A or chair in area B). The overcrowding problem especially for patients
with level 3 has been lessened when ambulance response time decreases to half of normal. This
may provide another solution for solving the overcrowding problem in this scenario.

Conclusions

To conclude, this article presented an agent-based model of emergency department that was
implemented in Netlogo simulation environment. Case studies have been carried out for proving
two of the possible uses of the simulator, one to meet the increasing patient arrival overcrowding
problem, and the second a quantitative analysis of the inﬂuence of ambulance response time
(for departure) over the ED behavior.
The ﬂexibility and adaptability features of this generic model provides a platform for emergency department simulation to accommodate diﬀerent scenarios without signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the underlying model. It enables the simulation researchers to focus their eﬀort on the
understanding of ED behavior rather than developing a theoretical model each time. Due to
the massive computational resources and big-data processing capacity provided by High Performance Computing(HPC), the simulator could execute a large number of simulations, each one
of them concerning diﬀerent scenarios, in order to obtain a large amount of interaction data
among the components of ED, which in some cases would not be available without simulation.

Then, applying data mining techniques on such model output data allows the decision makers
to gain new insights into the complexity of the interrelated variables and the eﬀect of changes
on the overall performance of the ED.
