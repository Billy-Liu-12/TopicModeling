Abstract
High order ﬁnite element methods can solve partial diﬀerential equations more eﬃciently than
low order methods. But how large of a polynomial degree is beneﬁcial? This paper addresses
that question through a case study of three problems representing problems with smooth solutions, problems with steep gradients, and problems with singularities. It also contrasts hadaptive, p-adaptive, and hp-adaptive reﬁnement. The results indicate that for low accuracy
requirements, like 1 % relative error, h-adaptive reﬁnement with relatively low order elements
is suﬃcient, and for high accuracy requirements, p-adaptive reﬁnement is best for smooth
problems and hp-adaptive reﬁnement with elements up to about 10th degree is best for other
problems.
Keywords: ﬁnite elements, high order methods, hp-FEM

Introduction

With fast convergence rates, high order ﬁnite element methods (FEM) can solve partial differential equations more eﬃciently in terms of accuracy vs. computational resources than low
order methods. For problems in which the solution exhibits some local phenomenon, like a wave
front or a singularity, use of adaptive mesh reﬁnement further improves the eﬃciency. There are
three versions of these ﬁnite element methods: 1) h-adaptive ﬁnite elements, in which accuracy
is improved by decreasing the size, h, of selected elements while keeping a ﬁxed polynomial
degree p, 2) p-adaptive ﬁnite elements, in which accuracy is improved by increasing the polynomial degree of selected elements while keeping the same spacial grid, and 3) hp-adaptive ﬁnite
elements, in which both element size and polynomial degree are changed.
But how large of a polynomial degree is beneﬁcial? As illustrated in Figure 2 of Section 4,
increasing the degree by one when it is small has a dramatic eﬀect on the convergence rate, but
once the degree becomes fairly large, the convergence rate does not change much. Moreover,
high order elements are more expensive computationally because 1) higher degree polynomial

basis functions require more operations to compute, 2) the quadrature rules for numerical
integration to compute the matrix for the discrete problem must be of correspondingly higher
order, which means more quadrature points at which to evaluate the basis functions, and 3) the
matrix for the discrete problem is denser, which means more computation to solve the linear
system. One would suspect that at some point the trade-oﬀ of more computation for a small
gain in convergence rate is no longer beneﬁcial.
This paper examines this question through a case study involving three 2D test problems
of diﬀerent character – a smooth solution, a steep gradient, and a singularity. In each case,
the three versions of the ﬁnite element method are used with diﬀerent polynomial degrees to
determine when increasing the degree no longer pays oﬀ.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the three test
problems used in the case study. Section 3 gives the details of the ﬁnite element methods
used. The main section of the paper is Section 4 which presents and discusses the results of the
computations. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 5.

Test Problems

Three test problems from the NIST Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement Benchmark Problems [5] are
used to study the convergence properties of the ﬁnite element methods.
Mild wave front. The arctan circular wave front problem is Poisson’s equation on the unit
square with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
−

∂2u ∂2u
− 2 = f in Ω = (0, 1) × (0, 1)
∂x2
∂y
u = g on ∂Ω

The functions f and g are chosen so that the exact solution is tan−1 (α(r − r0 )) where r =
(x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 . The mild wave front uses (x0 , y0 ) = (−0.05, −0.05), r0 = 0.7 and
α = 20. α controls the steepness of the wave, i.e., the magnitude of the gradient within the
wave front. The solution for this problem is very smooth, so conventional wisdom is that
p-reﬁnement and large values of p should be appropriate.
Steep wave front. This is the same as the mild wave front problem, but with α = 1000.
This is a very steep wave front with a rapid transition from a gradient near zero to a very large
gradient.
L-shaped domain. This is Laplace’s equation (Poisson’s equation with f = 0) on an Lshaped domain given by (−1, 1)×(−1, 1)\[0, 1)×(−1, 0], i.e. a square with the lower right quadrant removed. The exact solution is r2/3 sin(2θ/3) where r = x2 + y 2 and θ = tan−1 (y/x).
This has a point singularity at the origin. Conventional wisdom is to perform h-reﬁnement at
the singularity and p-reﬁnement elsewhere.

Details of the Finite Element Methods

The usual continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method is used with triangular elements. hreﬁnement is by newest node bisection [3]. The method begins with the coarse grid shown in
247

How High a Degree is High Enough

Figure 1: Initial grid for the wave front problems.
Figure 1 (the grid for the L-shaped domain problem is similar) and alternates between phases
of reﬁnement and solution of the discrete problem. A reﬁnement phase consists of reﬁning
all elements for which the error estimator is larger than half of the largest error estimator.
The error estimator is a high order version of the Bank-Weiser error estimator [1]. The basis
functions for the ﬁnite element space are the Szabo-Babuˇska p-hierarchical basis functions [7].
A multigrid solver is used to solve the linear system of the discrete problem.
All three versions of the ﬁnite element method are used. For h-adaptive FEM, a uniform
degree, p, is used for each p between 1 and 21. For p-adaptive FEM, a maximum degree of
21 is imposed. If reﬁnement is indicated for an element of degree 21, that element is not
reﬁned. If all elements that are marked for reﬁnement have degree 21, reﬁnement stalls and the
program terminates. For hp-adaptive FEM, a maximum degree, pmax , is speciﬁed for each value
between 1 and 21. When reﬁnement is indicated for an element of degree pmax , it is reﬁned by
h regardless of the type of reﬁnement indicated by the hp-adaptive strategy.
For the two wave front problems, the “type parameter” hp-adaptive strategy [2] is used. This
strategy performed well on the circular wave front problems in a recent study of hp-adaptive
strategies [6]. For the L-shaped domain problem, the a priori knowledge of the singularity is
used for the hp-adaptive strategy. Elements that touch the origin are reﬁned by h, and all
others are reﬁned by p.

Numerical Results

Computations were performed on one core of an Intel Xeon 2.5 GHz EMT64 1 operating under
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 5.10. The ﬁnite element code PHAML version 1.14.0 [4] was
compiled with the Intel Fortran compiler version 15.0.0.
The convergence of each method is examined via the relative energy norm of the error

vs. the number of degrees of freedom, and vs. the computation time, where u
˜ is the ﬁnite
element approximation to u. Two accuracy requirements are considered. The low accuracy of
10−2 (i.e. 1 % error) is typical of engineering applications. The high accuracy of 10−6 arises in
some scientiﬁc applications.
Figure 2 illustrates a typical convergence graph. This is the graph for hp-adaptive reﬁnement with the mild wave front problem. One can see that the convergence curves become
nearly identical once pmax is suﬃciently large, about pmax = 10 in this example. One can
also see that, for a given pmax , convergence of the hp-adaptive FEM is initially exponential, as
indicated by the curvature of the convergence curve, but eventually transitions to algebraic, as
indicated by the straightness of the convergence curve. The algebraic convergence corresponds
to the convergence rate of h-adaptive FEM with p = pmax , and indicates that the reﬁnement is
eventually dominated by h-reﬁnement of elements of degree pmax .
The tables of Sections 4.1-4.3 (see, for example, Table 2, which corresponds to Figure 3)
give the largest value of p (or pmax , throughout) that is beneﬁcial under several criteria. They
give the result for low and high accuracy, and for error vs. degrees of freedom (dof) and error
vs. computation time. The value of p is determined as illustrated in Figure 3. The value listed
as optimal is the smallest value of p that gives minimum dof (or time, throughout), 13 in the
illustration. One may also consider that the optimal p is not necessary, just one that is close
enough that it produces not much more work. The column labeled 10 % is the smallest value of
p for which the dof is less than 10 % more than the dof of the optimal p, 10 in the illustration.
Similarly the 2X column gives the p for which the dof is less than twice the optimum, 6 in the
illustration.

4.1

Mild Wave Front

Table 1 gives the largest beneﬁcial p for h-adaptive reﬁnement for the mild wave front problem.
For low accuracy, degrees 3 and 4 are optimal for dof and time, respectively. For high accuracy
solutions, higher order elements are more eﬀective, with degree 8 for dof and degree 12 for time.
In all cases, there is little, if any, reduction in p by allowing a 10 % increase in dof or time.
Allowing twice the resources also has little, if any, reduction in p, except for error vs. time for
the high accuracy solution where there is a substantial decrease from 12 to 6.
It may seem surprising that, for the high accuracy solution, a much higher degree is optimal
for error vs. time than that for error vs. dof, given the increase in the amount of computation
per degree of freedom as the polynomial degree is increased. The explanation is that the degree
12 run used many fewer reﬁne-solve loops than the degree 8 run (21 vs. 40), which means many
fewer instances of assembling and solving the linear system of the discrete problem. The reason
for fewer loops is that the higher order approximation has a smaller error on the initial grid,
1.24 × 10−5 as opposed to 2.89 × 10−4 .
Table 2 contains the largest beneﬁcial pmax for hp-adaptive reﬁnement with the mild wave
problem. Again degree 3 or 4 is optimal for low accuracy solutions. And again allowing higher
degrees is beneﬁcial for the high accuracy solution. But in this case the higher degree does not

beneﬁt from a more accurate solution on the initial grid (all of them start with p = 1), so the
optimal pmax is considerably smaller for error vs. time than for error vs. dof. But, the rate of
improvement in error vs. dof by increasing pmax drops rapidly after pmax = 6 so that if one
allows doubling the resources there is only a diﬀerence of one between the largest beneﬁcial
pmax for dof and time.
Figures 4 and 5 compare the three types of ﬁnite element methods, h-adaptive, p-adaptive
and hp-adaptive, using the optimal p and pmax from Tables 1 and 2. hp-adaptive with pmax = 8
is the same as pmax = 12 in the vicinity of error = 10−2 , so that curve is not included. For error
vs. dof, hp-adaptive reﬁnement is superior to h-reﬁnement with the optimal p, but p-adaptive
reﬁnement is even better. For error vs. time, p-adaptive reﬁnement is still superior to hpadaptive reﬁnement, but h-adaptive reﬁnement is better than p-adaptive reﬁnement, especially
at low accuracy. This is probably because the p-adaptive reﬁnement has higher order elements
than the selected ﬁxed degree for h-adaptive reﬁnement. For this example they were as high
as p = 6 for error = 10−2 and p = 17 for error = 10−6 . But for h-adaptivity to be superior to
p-adaptivity, one must know the optimal p for the desired accuracy.

4.2

Steep Wave Front

Table 3 gives the largest beneﬁcial p for h-adaptive reﬁnement for the steep wave front problem.
At low accuracy, p = 4 is optimal for error vs. dof, and p = 6 is optimal for error vs. time.

However, with just a 10 % increase in time, p = 4 is suﬃcient. At high accuracy, it is beneﬁcial
to use higher order elements.
Table 4 gives the largest beneﬁcial pmax for hp-adaptive reﬁnement for the steep wave front
problem. For the low accuracy solution, pmax = 9 is optimal for error vs. dof, but with a 10
% increase in the dof pmax = 4 is suﬃcient. The high accuracy solution beneﬁts from very
high order elements, with pmax = 18 optimal for error vs. dof, but allowing twice as many dof
reduces it to pmax = 7, the same as the optimal pmax for error vs. time.
Figures 6 and 7 compare the three types of ﬁnite element methods. p-adaptive reﬁnement
stalls and is ineﬀective on this problem, so it is omitted from Figure 7. The steep wave front
cannot be resolved by high degree polynomials alone; small elements are required. hp-adaptive
reﬁnement is better than h-adaptive reﬁnement in terms of error vs. dof, but h-adaptive reﬁnement is better in terms of time if the correct value of p is used.

4.3

L-shaped Domain

Table 5 gives the largest beneﬁcial p for h-adaptive reﬁnement for the L-shaped domain problem.
Low order p = 2 elements are most eﬀective for low accuracy in error vs. dof, but in error vs. time
p = 5 is optimal, with p = 2 within a factor of two. For high order, p = 5 or 6 is most eﬀective.
Table 6 gives the largest beneﬁcial pmax for hp-adaptive reﬁnement for the L-shaped domain
problem. For low accuracy with an allowance of 10 % above the optimal, p = 2 is suﬃcient.

High accuracy beneﬁts from higher order elements with pmax = 8 or 9.
Figures 8 and 9 compare the three types of ﬁnite element methods. p-adaptive reﬁnement
stalls and is not eﬀective, because high order elements are not good at approximating singularities. At low accuracy there is eﬀectively no diﬀerence between h-adaptive reﬁnement and
hp-adaptive reﬁnement in error vs. dof, but h-adaptive reﬁnement is considerably faster. At
high accuracy, hp-adaptive reﬁnement is superior in both dof and time.

Conclusion

This paper addressed the question of how large of a polynomial degree is beneﬁcial to high order
ﬁnite element methods, and contrasted h-adaptive, p-adaptive and hp-adaptive reﬁnement.
Three test problems were used representing problems with smooth solutions, problems with
steep gradients, and problems with singularities.
In general it appears that for a low accuracy requirement like 1 % relative error, h-adaptive
reﬁnement with relatively low order elements is suﬃcient. The singular problem did not beneﬁt
from p > 2, and for the nonsingular problems p = 3 or 4 is large enough.
For high accuracy requirement, higher order elements are appropriate. But there is little
beneﬁt in going past p = 10 or so in the convergence with respect to the number of degrees of
freedom, and a maximum p of about 6 or 8 is suﬃcient in terms of optimal computation time,

except for smooth problems. For smooth problems, p-adaptive reﬁnement is most eﬀective
and is recommended. For other problems, hp-adaptive reﬁnement is superior to h-adaptive
reﬁnement in terms of error vs. dof. h-adaptive reﬁnement was faster, but only if the optimal
p for the given accuracy requirement is known, so hp-adaptive reﬁnement is recommended.
