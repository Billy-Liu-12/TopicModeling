Abstract
Iterative methods based on skew-symmetric splitting of initial matrix, arising from central
ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation of steady convection-diﬀusion-reaction (CDR) equation in 2-D
domain are considered. The property of obtained large sparse nonsymmetric linear system
Au = f is investigated. A new class of triangular and product triangular skew-symmetric
iterative methods is presented. Suﬃcient conditions of convergence for iterative methods of
solution CDR with variable coeﬃcient of reaction and dominant convection are obtained.
The results of numerical experiments for the solution of a two-dimensional CDR equation
are presented. The uniform grid, central diﬀerences for the ﬁrst derivatives, natural ordering of
points, Peclet numbers P e = 103 , 104 , 105 , variable coeﬃcient of reaction and diﬀerent velocity
coeﬃcients have been used.

been connected with convection-diﬀusion (CD) problems and their numerical solution [11]. The
most diﬃcult problems for numerical solution of CD equation are [23]:
1. diﬀusion is quite small which means that the dimensionless parameter P e > 103 ,
2. the ﬁeld of velocity has stagnation points,
Many diﬀerent approaches have been proposed [15], [19], [23] to resolve the diﬃculties exponential ﬁtting, compact diﬀerences, upwinding, streamline diﬀusion [5], artiﬁcial viscosity
and so on. Approximation of the ﬁrst order derivatives in CD is the most interesting aspect
of the solution for problem and very important work. It is well known [22], [15] that using for
approximation ﬁrst order derivatives upwind schemes gives us linear equation systems with Mmatrix [21], but matrix which can be obtained by using central FD schemes [6] is positive real.
Each of these schemes have their own advantages and deﬁciencies which have been discussed in
[23], [15].
When CRD equations investigate it is necessary to take into account the sign of reaction
coeﬃcient. If it is nonnegative then there is no problem with numerical solution, but if it is
negative then the diﬃculties can arise. So if the negative coeﬃcient reaction exists in CDR
equation it means that after approximation it moves spectra of arising matrix in the left half
part and matrix can lose property of being positive real. So, there is one more diﬃculty added
to CDR equation in this case.
3. the coeﬃcient of reaction is negative.
Consider the convection-diﬀusion-reaction equation written in symmetric form [10] in
bounded domain Ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1] with boundary condition:

δΩ is the boundary of Ω, Cgr is the boundary value.

Finite diﬀerence approximation of the equation

The uniform grid Ωh with step hx = hy = h has been introduced in domain Ω. Introduce
functions C(xi , yk ) = Cik , xi = i ∗ h1 , yk = k ∗ h1 . All unknowns are calculated in the middle of
the cell. The boundary conditions on ∂Ω are interpolated on the boundary ∂Ωh with a second
order truncation error. The standard notation originating from [17] is used. The boundary
conditions, with appropriate coeﬃcients, are taken into account on the right-hand side of the
diﬀerence equations. The central diﬀerence approximation of the ﬁrst derivatives has been used.
So, we obtain for (1)

System of linear algebraic equation

Using natural ordering of the unknowns, we transform (5) to the nonsymmetric linear system
of equations

A = AΔ + A1 + D, A0 =

1
2

Au = f,
A + AT = AΔ + D = AT0 ,

A1 =

1

A − AT = −AT1 ,

(7)

where A is (N − 1) × (N − 1) matrix, N = h1 , u = {u11 , u12 , ..., uN −1N −1 }T is the vector of
solution, f = {f11 , f12 , ..., fN −1N −1 }T is the vector of the right part. Matrix A can be naturally
expressed [6] in the case of central diﬀerence approximation of the convective terms in (5) as a
sum of symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix AΔ , skew-symmetric matrix A1 and diagonal matrix
D. AΔ is a diﬀerence analogue Δh of operator Δ, describing a diﬀusion process, D is discrete
analogue of the reaction term in the equation (1). A1 is a diﬀerence analogue of the convective
terms. Thus, linear system (7) with non-symmetric matrix A is constructed.
If in (7)
A0 = AT0 > 0,
then matrix A is called positive real.

The linear system (7) is called strongly non-symmetric if
A0 / A1 ∼ O(1),
where ∗ is one of matrix norms.
It can be easily veriﬁed that system (7) becomes strongly nonsymmetric for large values of
P e and α = 0. As a result we have
A0 ∞ = 4,

+ |v2i,j + v2i+1,j | + |v2i,j + v2i−1,j |)/2,

Theorem 3.1. Let equation (1) be approximated by ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme (5). Then the
system (7) is positive real if α ≥ 0.
Proof.
The symmetric part A0 of matrix A has the form A0 = AΔ + D and doesn’t have a deﬁnite
sign in general case, but it is well known [17] that matrix AΔ is positive deﬁnite. So, if diagonal
matrix D has nonnegative elements then A0 will be positive deﬁnite as the sum of positive
deﬁnite and nonnegative deﬁnite matrices. The last means that A0 > 0 if α ≥ 0 and system
(7) is positive real.
It is well-known [15], [19] that using upwind scheme for equation (1) leads us to the system
(7) with A being M -matrix [20], but in this case the obtained system won’t be essentially
nonsymmetric because matrix A has diagonal dominant. It is necessary to pay our attention
[10] that the form in which we will approximate convection-diﬀusion equation plays a great role
in successful numerical solution.
Consider case when coeﬃcient α < 0. If Ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1], boundary conditions are (2) and
regular mesh is used, then eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Lh = − P1e Δh + α are well-known
[18], [12]:

of being positive real then from Hirsh theorem [13], its spectrum can move to the left half plane.

Two-parameters skew-symmetric iterative solvers

Besides important role in the mathematical modeling convection-diﬀusion-reaction equation is
a good test for iterative methods. A lot of papers [1], [4], [23] have already described numerical
experiments with CD or CDR equations for diﬀerent parameters.
Diﬀerent basic iterative methods such as ILU [1], [3], [16], SOR [21], [22]have been used
directly for solution of arising after approximation of CD or CDR equations by linear equation
systems as well as preconditioners for CG or BiCG type’s methods [14]. As it was shown in [1],
ILU as a preconditioner for GMRES(20) and BiCGStab has been broken for large Reh , α = 0
from (6) and natural ordering of the unknowns.
We present a two parameters triangular [7] and product triangular iterative [2] methods
that use the skew-symmetric part of the matrix as an input and only require the matrix (7)
to be positive real. Some ideas for using the splitting of skew-symmetric part of the matrix to
solve linear equation systems arising after central diﬀerence approximation of ﬁrst order terms
in (5) have been ﬁrstly proposed in [6].
Let us approach (7) by considering the iterative method of the following form:
y n+1 − y n
+ Ay n = f , n ≥ 0 ,
(8)
τ
where f, y0 ∈ H,H is an n-dimensional real Hilbert space, f is the right part of (7), A, B(ω)
are matrices)in H, A is given by equation (7), B(ω) is invertible, y0 is an initial guess, yk is the
k-th approach, τ, ω > 0 are iterative parameters, u is the solution that we obtain, ek = y k − u
and rk = Aek denote the error and the residual in the k-th iteration, respectively.
Here it is important to note that B(ω) is in a certain sense a preconditioned matrix. In
general, B(ω) is supposed to be nonsymmetric.
Method (8) may be also represented as
B(ω)

y n+1 = Gy n + τ f,
G = B −1 (ω)(B(ω) − τ A) .

(9)

Consider the two ways of choosing matrix B. The ﬁrst is
B(ω) = BC + ω((1 + j)KL + (1 − j)KU ), j = ±1, Bc = BcT
and the second is

−1
B(ω) = (BC + ωKU )BC
(BC + ωKL ), Bc = BcT

(10)
(11)

T
where KL + KU = A1 , KL = −KUT , BC = BC
. The matrices KL and KU represent strictly
upper and lower triangular parts of a skew-symmetric matrix A1 from (7) and matrix BC
can be chosen arbitrarily, but has to be symmetric. These methods are called two-parameters
triangular (TM) and product triangular (PTM) methods respectively.
Matrix B is non-symmetric and can be represented as

B + B T = B0T , B1 =
B − B T = −B1T .

We ﬁnd the symmetric and the skew-symmetric parts of matrix B for TM

Proof of this theorem consists of two step:
-show that P0T is positive real (Its the property of positive real matrix [18], if A is positive
real, then C = QAQT is positive real, too). So, from (17) P0T is positive real.
- insert in (22) α = 12 ω, β = (τ − 12 ω) then we’ve got (26).

Numerical experiments

In this section we present the results of numerical experiments in which the technique described
above is used to solve nonsymmetric linear systems with α < 0 and α = 0. We compare the
performance of SSOR [14] and PTM [2] iterative methods to solve linear systems arising from
the standard 5-point FD approximation of the steady convection–diﬀusion-reaction problem (1)
- (3) where F is chosen so that the solution of (1) is deﬁned as
u
˜(x, y) = exy sin πx sin πy .
Equation (1) has been discretized by centered diﬀerences on a uniform grid with 33 × 33.
In the table 1 the used velocity coeﬃcients of (1) are presented. Note that, for each model
problem they are chosen to satisfy the constraint divv = v1x + v2y = 0 (which follows from the
medium incompressibility for the problem (2)). On the whole, in order to the test results to be
comparable with those obtained in the other adjacent papers we take the analytical solution
and the velocity coeﬃcients similar to those in [3].
The initial guess in all runs was a zero vector and iterations were performed until

Table 2: Number of iterations for diﬀerent α

represents the Euclidean norm. Checking and comparwhere rm is the residual vector, and
ing iterative methods SSOR and PTM for diﬀerent negative α (Table 2) we show that methods
are very good for |α| > 100. It means that matrix (7) is strongly diagonal dominant. This is
connected with existence on main diagonal of elements a1 = (4 + αP eh2 ), which we obtain after
approximation of coeﬃcient of reaction. It includes numbers α and Reh , grows by module α
and Reh . As we can see from the Table 2 the number of iteration for α = 0 grows with the
increasing Peclet number. In contrast of this behavior of both iterative methods, the number
of iteration decreases with grow of Peclet number and modula coeﬃcient of reaction.

Conclusions

The behavior of iterative methods to solve (7) which was obtained after approximation of CD
(α = 0) and CDR (α < 0) equations is quite diﬀerent (Table 2). The case with α = 0 shows
that matrix loses the property of diagonal dominance and the methods require more iterations
as Reh increasing. Case with α ≤ 0 for big numbers α shows a very quick convergence of both
methods for big numbers of Reh .
