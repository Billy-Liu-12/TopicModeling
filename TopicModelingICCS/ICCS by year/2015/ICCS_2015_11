Abstract
In this work the application of random set theory to flood embankment stability modelling is presented.
The objective of this paper is to illustrate a method of uncertainty analysis in a real geotechnical problem.
Keywords: flood embankment stability modeling, random set theory, numerical calculations

1 Introduction
One of the most important problems encountered in physical process modelling with geotechnical
analysis is the uncertainty of the value of material parameters. This problem is especially important for
physical processes and simulation modelling in which deformations of complex underground structures
have to be predicted.
The uncertainty is caused mainly by significant variations in the values of material parameters due
to a lack of data and the consequent need to find alternative sources of information. In practice these
sources are often previously published data for similar conditions or areas, or correlations derived from
literature or expert knowledge. A common feature of alternative sources is that they value is determined
by the intervals without any information over the probability distribution across the intervals. The
assessment of the material parameter values which may indicate the stability of a flood embankment is
an example of issue where the set-based information has to be analysed.
In this paper the application of random set theory to the flooding process is presented. It is preceded
by some brief information about the theory, which is a mathematical representation of uncertainties. The
results presented in this paper make it possible to assess the probability of the occurrence of a given
value of a parameter which is important in terms of embankment stability, and to track changes in the
probability range during modelling of the flooding process.

2 Random set theory
The first publications on the topic of random set theory date back to the mid-seventies (Kendall,
1974; Matheron, 1975). Random set theory, in general, can be used for the mathematical description of
uncertainty associated with imprecise input parameters. This method provides a general framework
relating to information based on sets and discrete probability distribution (Pottler, Marcher, Nasekhian,
& Schweiger , 2009).
Let X be a non-empty set of all possible values of variable x. According to Dubois and Prade (Dubois
& Prade, 1991), a finite support random set on universal set X is a pair ሺ࣠ǡ ݉ሻ where ࣠ ൌ ሼ‫ܣ‬௜ ‫ ݅ ׷‬ൌ
ͳǡ Ǥ Ǥ Ǥ ǡ ݊ሽ and mass assignment m is the mapping:
݉ǣ ࣠ ՜ ሾͲǡͳሿǢ
݉ሺሻ ൌ ͲǢ
෍ ݉ሺ‫ܣ‬ሻ ൌ ͳǤ
஺࣠

࣠ is called the support of a random set. All ‫ ܺ א ܣ‬for which ݉ሺ‫ܣ‬ሻ ് Ͳ are the focal elements and
݉ሺ‫ܣ‬ሻ is the probability that a specific element of X belongs to set A, but does not belong to any special
subset of A.
Due to imprecision, it is impossible to calculate the probability of ‫ ܺ א ݔ‬or subset ‫ܺ ؿ ܧ‬, however
the lower Bel(A) and upper Pl(A) bounds of this probability can be calculated (Schweiger & Peschl,
2005):
‫ܺ א ܣ׊‬ǡ ‫݈݁ܤ‬ሺ‫ܣ‬ሻ ൌ ෍ ݉ሺ‫ܤ‬ሻ ൌ ͳ െ ݈ܲሺ ‫ܣ‬ሻ
஻‫ك‬஺

‫ܺ א ܣ׊‬ǡ ݈ܲሺ‫ܣ‬ሻ ൌ ෍ ݉ሺ‫ܤ‬ሻ ൌ ͳ െ ‫݈݁ܤ‬ሺ‫ܣ‬ሻ
஻‫ת‬஺ஷ‫׎‬

Bel(A) can be considered as the lower bound on a set of probability measures and Pl(A) as the upper
bound, but the converse is not true (Hall, Rubio, & Anderson, 2004). In a special case, when ࣠ contains
only single values, then Bei(A)=Pl(A) and m is the probability distribution function. Bel(A) and Pl(A)
are envelopes of all possible cumulative distribution functions compatible with the data.
Random set theory provides a convenient mechanism for combining probabilistic and set-based
information. It is possible to extend random sets through a functional relation directly (Tonon, Bernardi,
& Mammio, 2000). Let g be a mapping ܺͳ ൈ ‫ ڮ‬ൈ ܺܰ ՜ ܻ and ‫ ͳݔ‬ൈ ‫ ڮ‬ൈ ‫ ܰݔ‬a variable whose values
are partially known and which can be dependent. The incomplete knowledge about ࢞ ൌ ሺ‫ݔ‬ଵ ǡ ǥ ǡ ‫ݔ‬ே ሻ can
be represented as a random relation, which is a random set ሺ࣠ǡ ݉ሻ on the Cartesian product ܺͳ ൈ ‫ ڮ‬ൈ
ܺܰ . The random set ሺԸǡ ߩሻ, which is the image of ሺ࣠ǡ ݉ሻ through g is given by:

(Pottler, Marcher, Nasekhian, & Schweiger , 2009; Schweiger & Peschl, 2005), then the joint basic

The main part of the method using random set theory is the calculation according to Eqs. (4) and (5)
of the image of a focal element through function g.

3 Random set finite difference method scheme
In this section the procedure of a random set finite difference method is presented. The procedure is
applied to a flood embankment numerical modelling problem. The scheme of this procedure was
proposed by the authors on the basis of their experience with numerical modelling of flood embankments
in different geological conditions and a study of the literature (Peschl, 2004; Pottler, Marcher,
Nasekhian, & Schweiger , 2009; Nasekhian & Schweiger, 2010; Schweiger & Peschl, 2005; Hall, Rubio,
& Anderson, 2004; Pilecki, Stanisz, Krawiec, WoĨniak, & Pilecka, 2014).
The procedure is realised in three stages:
•
•
•

Sensitivity analyses of the input parameters
Numerical analyses of the input parameters values by means of random sets
Cumulative probability analyses.

3.1 Sensitivity analyses of the input parameters
The main purpose of sensitivity analysis is to determine the most important input parameters which
have the greatest influence on calculation results. The advantage of this analysis is the reduction of the
number of input parameters adapted in the next steps of the calculation.
There are three steps in this analysis. First, the sensitivity ratio ߟௌோ of the variable x is calculated.
This can be described as the change in model output divided by the unit change of an input variable
according to (Peschl, 2004):
ቂ
ߟௌோ ൌ

௙൫௫ಽǡೃ ൯ି௙ሺ௫೘ ሻ

ቂ

௙ሺ௫೘ ሻ
௫ಽǡೃ ି௫೘
௫೘

ቃ

ቃ
Ǥ

Each variable has four sensitivity ratios which can be separated into two categories: local and range.
For the local category, input variable ‫ݔ‬௅ is varied within a small interval of the random set. In the range
sensitivity ratio, input variable ‫ݔ‬ோ is varied across the whole range of the random set (fig. 1). This
analysis required Ͷܰ ൅ ͳ calculations where N is the number of basic variables being considered.

Figure 1: Local and range intervals (Peschl, 2004).

2670

Random Set Method Application to Flood Embankment Stability...

A. Pieta and K. Krawiec

In second step the sensitivity ratio is weighted by a normalised measure of the variability in an input
variable:
ሺ ‫ݔ‬ோ െ  ‫ݔ‬ோ ሻ
ߟௌௌ ൌ ߟௌோ ή
Ǥ
‫ݔ‬௠
In the following steps of analysis the sensitivity score of each input variable ߟௌௌǡ௜ on respective
results (displacements, forces, pore pressures, factor of safety and so on) and each construction step can
be calculated. The total sensitivity score of all variables is the summation of all sensitivity scores (local
and range) for each respective result. In the third step the total relative sensitivity ߙሺ‫ݔ‬௜ ሻ for each input
variable is given by:
σ ߟௌௌǡ௜
ߙሺ‫ݔ‬௜ ሻ ൌ ே
Ǥ
σ௜ୀଵ σ ߟௌௌǡ௜
It is important to introduce a threshold value to determine which parameter has the greatest total
sensitivity and the greatest impact on calculation results. Usually a threshold value between 5% and
10% is appropriate (Shen & Abbas, 2013).

3.2 Numerical analysis
If the most important input parameters are determined, it is necessary to construct input files for the
numerical calculations. The combinations need to be prepared of the different sources and extremes of
the most important parameters based on a/the random set model. Consider the vector ‫ ܺ א ݔ‬of three
parameters ‫ ݔ‬ൌ ሺ‫ܣ‬ǡ ‫ܤ‬ǡ ‫ܥ‬ሻ which has information from two sources. A random relation is defined on the
Cartesian product ‫ ܣ‬ൈ ‫ ܤ‬ൈ ‫ܥ‬, and according to combination calculus the pairs are given in the following
pairs:
‫ ܣ‬ൈ ‫ ܤ‬ൈ ‫ ܥ‬ൌ  ሼሺ‫ܣ‬ଵ ǡ ‫ܤ‬ଵ ǡ ‫ܥ‬ଵ ሻଵ ǡ ሺ‫ܣ‬ଶ ǡ ‫ܤ‬ଵ ǡ ‫ܥ‬ଵ ሻଵ ǡ ሺ‫ܣ‬ଵ ǡ ‫ܤ‬ଶ ǡ ‫ܥ‬ଵ ሻଵ ǡ Ǥ Ǥ Ǥ ǡ ሺ‫ܣ‬ଶ ǡ ‫ܤ‬ଶ ǡ ‫ܥ‬ଶ ሻ଼ ሽǤ
The index of parameters referring to set number and the index of pairs denotes one combination of
important variables. Subsequently, the interval analysis is performed, by which the deterministic values
of input parameters of the worst and the best case of each are realised.
The number of all possible realizations ݊௖ in the random set approach is given by:
ே

ே

݊௖ ൌ ʹ ෑ ݊௜ Ǥ
௜ୀଵ

Where ܰ means the number of important parameters identified during sensitivity analysis, and ݊
denotes the number of information sources.
Values of any other input parameters that were proved to be less important during sensitivity analysis
are taken as mean values. All the finite difference calculations corresponding to input parameters are
performed.

3.3 Cumulative probability analysis
For each numerical realisation the probability of assignment is determined. It is assumed that random
variables are stochastically independent (Tonon, Bernardi, & Mammio, 2000). The probability of the
response element ‫ ݔ‬ൌ ሺ‫ܣ‬ଵ ǡ ‫ܤ‬ଵ ǡ ‫ܥ‬ଵ ) obtained through function ݂ሺ‫ݔ‬ሻ (the finite difference method) is the
product of probability assignment ݉ of input parameters by each other:
݉൫݂ሺ‫ܣ‬௜ ǡ ‫ܤ‬௜ ǡ ‫ܥ‬௜ ሻ൯ ൌ ݉ሺ‫ܣ‬௜ ሻ ή ݉ሺ‫ܤ‬௜ ሻ ή ݉ሺ‫ܥ‬௜ ሻ
Result values such as displacements, strains, pore pressures and others are calculated in terms of
lower (right) and upper (left) bounds on discrete cumulative probability functions (Schweiger & Peschl,
2005). To obtain the left bound of the distribution of the probability, the low bounds of the interval are
sorted from smallest to greatest, and the cumulative distribution curve is stepped upward. To construct
the right bound of the distribution, the probability mass for each interval is assumed to be concentrated

at the upper bound of the interval. An example of constructing a cumulative probability chart is
illustrated in figure 2.

Figure 2: Example of cumulative probability chart.
The discrete cumulative distribution function can be fitted, for example, using a/the best-fit method
in order to achieve a continuous function. This procedure makes it possible to extract valuable
information from the calculation result, for example, the probability that a threshold value is exceeded.
Based on figure 2 the most likely values can be estimated. In general, the most likely values are
defined as values with the highest probability of occurrence, or in the case of a cumulative distribution
function, they can be found on the steepest part of the slope (Pottler, Marcher, Nasekhian, & Schweiger
, 2009).

4 Application of the random set theory to flooding process.
The assessment of the stability of the various geotechnical constructions is based on numerous
sources, observations and experiments, and can differ significantly due to ground conditions, the
specifications of the given constructions, environmental conditions and other factors. Determination of
the “safe value” of a material parameter is one of the significant coefficients that can be used to estimate
the stability of a given geotechnical construction.
In figures 3 and 4 an overview of the random set numerical calculation for the flooding process is
presented.

Figure 4: Ranges probability calculations using random set models.
Random set theory can combine information such as geometry of the assumed model, boundary
and initial conditions for numerical calculations, and the uncertainty of values of material parameters
(fig 3a). During the sensitivity analysis, each group of information can be taken into account with
different probabilities (fig 3b). Results obtained after sensitivity analysis (3c) significantly reduce the
amount of datasets (fig 4a) for which numerical modelling has to be performed in order to obtain the
lower and upper cumulative distribution functions for a single parameter (fig 4b).

5 Calculation of embankment stability during the flooding
process.
Computation was performed using the FLAC two-dimensional explicit finite difference program.
This enables the performing of coupled mechanical-fluid flow-thermal processes used in embankment
stability modelling (Itasca Consulting Group, 2011). The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was used for
the embankment model.

5.1 Description of the geological model
Numerical calculations were performed for the experimental embankment built for the ISMOP
project. ISMOP (MoĞcicki, Bania, ûwiklik, & Borecka, 2014) is a joint academic-industrial research
related to complex systems of monitoring and state forecasting of river levees (PiĊta, Lupa, M.,
Piórkowski, & LeĞniak, 2014; Chuchro, Lupa, PiĊta, Piórkowski, & LeĞniak, 2014). The geometry of
the experimental embankment is depicted in following picture (fig. 5).

5.2 Stability analysis of the flooding process – basic variables for the
random set model.
Material parameters for the soil layers regarded as basic variables are summarised in table 2. Two
intervals of parameters were determined independently. The first set was determined from experimental
investigation (MoĞcicki, Bania, ûwiklik, & Borecka, 2014; ISMOP, 2013-2016)The second was
assumed according to previous experience and literature research (expert knowledge) (Pieta, Bala,

5.3 Numerical calculations
Quantification of the influence of the considered variables on certain results can be performed using
sensitivity analysis. The main object of this step is the exclusion of insignificant parameters, which leads
to a reduction in the amount of computation that is performed during random set analysis. Sensitivity
analysis was made for all the computational nodes of the assumed model of embankment, whereas the
most significant parameters were identified for the computational nodes located on the surface of the
assumed model and in the area where the embankment is in contact with the ground (dotted line in
Figure no . 7).
Computational nodes located in this area are the most exposed to the loss of stability during the
flooding process. Results of sensitivity analysis obtained after seven days of modelling of the flooding
process are presented in (fig. 7).

Figure 7: Sensitivity analysis results obtained for significant nodes of the computational grid.
Cohesion and porosity were identified as the least sensitive parameters among all values presented
in table 2 for the modelling of the coupled mechanical, thermal and fluid flow processes. The values of
cohesion and porosity for all the computational nodes presented in figure 7 are insignificant compared
to the value of the remaining parameters.
Only parameters with sensitivity higher than 10% were taken into consideration in the further
analysis covering random set probability estimation. Parameters such as hydraulic conductivity, density
and friction with sensitivity lower than 10% were indicated as parameters with significant impact on the
described flooding process.

5.4 Random set analysis
After application of the random set theory to the flood embankment stability modelling, the
cumulative probability distribution functions for all the computational nodes were obtained. The lower
and upper cumulative distribution function can be obtained for all the parameters that vary during the
coupled process of mechanical fluid and thermal interaction modelling, for example horizontal and
vertical displacements, pore pressure, temperature etc. Lower and upper cumulative distribution
functions of horizontal displacement values obtained in the computational node are presented in figure
7 labelled as ‘A’. The cumulative distribution functions were constructed for the numerical simulation
at the end of the assumed time period of the flood embankment stability modelling process, after five
(432,000 s), six (518,400 s) and seven days (604,800 s) of flooding process.

Figure 8: Results of random data set analysis obtained for point marked with the label “A” on
Figure no 7 after 5, 6 and 7 days of flood embankment stability modelling.
Figure 8 shows that horizontal displacement values change significantly as theflood modelling
progresses over time. The most likely values of the horizontal displacement are in a range of
approximately 1.33 to 2.33 mm after five days, 1.33 to 2.31 after six days and 1.33 to 2.30 after 7 days.
These values are relatively small for the proposed sets of input parameters. The cumulative probability
distribution functions and the normal distribution fitted curve make it possible to assess the probability
that horizontal displacement is greater than the threshold value. For example the probability that
displacement will be greater than 2.4 mm is less than 0.26 after five days, less than 0.21 after six days
and less than 0.14 after 7 days of flooding.

6 Conclusion
In this paper the application of random set analysis to flooding process modelling is presented. The
obtained results confirm the suitability of the random set method for geotechnical problems with
imprecise data and a lack of information. Random set analysis can also be useful for verifying the results
of numerical modelling and can indicate if there is significant effect on the numerical modelling results
of the assumption made during the numerical modelling process, such as simplification of geology or
lack of inhomogeneity in physical parameters of the geological layers. This can be achieved by
verification if the parameter results and in situ behaviour are located within the ranges obtained after
applying random set analysis.
