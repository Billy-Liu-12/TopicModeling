Abstract
In this work the framework for detectors layout optimization based on a multi-agent simulation is
proposed. Its main intention is to provide a decision support team with a tool for automatic design of
social threat detection systems for public crowded places. Containing a number of distributed
detectors, this system performs detection and an identification of threat carriers. The generic model of
detector used in the framework allows to consider detection of various types of threats, e.g. infections,
explosives, drugs, radiation. The underlying agent-based models provide data on social mobility,
which is used along with a probability based quality assessment model within the optimization
process. The implemented multi-criteria optimization scheme is based on a genetic algorithm. For
experimental study the framework has been applied in order to get the optimal detectors' layout in
Pulkovo airport.

1 Introduction
Today facing crowded places is an ordinary practice in urban life. This usually happens, for
example, at transport hubs (airports, stations). Crowded places are connected with several types of
threats that have a large effect on public safety. Because of the large number of people crowds, they
often become a target for terrorist attacks. On the other hand, the complex character of crowds and
inability to check everybody allows smugglers to transport illegal cargo through crowded places. And
the interactive nature of crowds with many contacts inside, leads to the propagation of infections.

In order to detect such threats, screening detectors are widely used. The main principle of
functioning for such detectors is based on a sequential gathering of air samples. It takes some period
of time, from tens of seconds to a half an hour (Gooding, 2006). A detector generates a signal of alert
if an internal test gives a positive result. Such screening detectors usually are not as precise as
individual checking. But they are less time consuming and can handle more people without causing
queues. Due to economical reasons and installation limitations, it is usually impossible to cover the
entire crowded place with such detectors. And there are also different types of detectors which can
differ by some parameters like cost, detection precision, etc. Thereby, there is a need to choose
detector types, and correct positions for detector placement. This determines a multi-objective
optimization problem.
Pedestrian flows formed by people’s movements have a great influence on different characteristics
of the crowded place, which affects the performance of detectors layout. However, it is not enough to
know only aggregated characteristics in order to find out optimal detector layout. Some goals of the
detection system, which is being designed, may require more detailed information, e.g. the goal of
identification of individual “threat carriers”. Usually a single detector cannot solve the identification
problem, as it has its latency and it is receptive to noise caused by a large group of people. In this
case, an identification problem is solved on the level of a whole detection system.
This work is devoted to the detector layout optimization problem and contributes: an optimization
framework architecture based on agent-based simulation; a formulation of multi objective
combinatorial optimization problem based on quality assessment model which uses information about
pedestrian flows and accounts the described types of detectors; a data structure optimization procedure
which allows reducing time of optimization procedure spent dealing with massive simulation data; an
experimental case study for Pulkovo airport (Saint-Petersburg).

2 Related works
The general problem of detector layout optimization has emerged in various fields such as gas leak
detection, intruder detection, detection of threats in water, and detection of biological or chemical
attacks. This problem is well known in the wireless sensor networks engineering area of research
(Molina., Alba & Talbi 2008; Dhillon & Chakrabarty, 2003). Works in this area are focused on the
network’s topology, observable natural phenomena coverage, and don’t take into account aspects
connected with crowd dynamics and crowd simulation. Another related area is tracking people with a
system of video cameras (Qian & Qi, 2008; Jin & Bhanu, 2012).
The most widely accepted approach to solve the task of detector layout optimization within the
crowded place is based on aggregated information about such a place, and geometric principles.
Particularly, Kiekintveld & Lerma (2011) consider detecting biological weapons. Their approach is
based on a natural idea to place more detectors in areas with more population and fewer in areas with
fewer people. They try to optimize coverage of important zones based on geometrical principles. The
work assumes presence of data about population density, which may be unknown in advance. The
model of detectors is not oriented to take into account features such as time of sample gathering. Also,
visiting several sensors does not influence the optimization process directly, and some features like
different velocity of threat spreading in different directions can be ignored. Väkevä(2007) have
proposed to use risk-based analysis for detector placement which is aimed at event detection. The
authors (Nie, Batta, Drury & Lin, 2007; Stolkin, Vickers & Nickerson, 2007) use similar approach to
ours, which is focused on the calculation of probability of an agent interception based on several
measurements performed by independent detectors. In the work (Nie, Batta, Drury & Lin, 2007) the
model assumes the presence of only the one suicide bomber, and detectors work in an instant mode.
Otherwise, our model is targeted to deal with the cumulative probability of detector's activation which

is received from a group of participants. Also, in the last work, influence of pedestrian activity is not
taken into account. Approaches which apply in gas leak detection or water threat detection areas
commonly use methods based on coverage volume optimization and calculating probability from
independent measurements and sources optimization (DeFriend, Dejmek, Porter, Deshotels & Natvig,
2008; Legg S. W. et al, 2012; Berry, Hart, Phillips, Uber & Watson, 2006) and are focused on an
event detection, not an agent identification.

3 Problem statement
In this section the used terminology and class of problems under consideration are defined.
The detector layout optimization problem is solved within a defined spatial area. That area is
structured by a certain topology, which may influence pedestrian flows inside it. The topology is
determined by floors, walls, and other barriers, and may have staircases, transitions, lifts, entrances,
and exits. Pedestrian flows are formed by agents, which move through the area according to their
goals and environmental circumstances. Some agents are threat carriers. Threat in a general case is
some feature the detection system looks for, which can be detected by some type of detectors.
Depending on the use case, threat carriers can or cannot transmit threats to other participants. The
detection system may be managed by a security service of the crowded place. Depending on the use
case, the goal of the detection system may be defined as both: detection of threat event appearance
inside the crowded place; identification of individual agents, which are threat carriers.
Individual detectors within the detection system have certain parameters and limitations such as:
radius of detection zone, base detection probability, installation cost, and collect time interval. The
last limitation makes detectors unable to recognize threat carriers on the fly. Detectors are able to do it
only for a group of agents, whose trajectories have crossed the detection zone at different time
moments. Some agents in this group can be threat carriers. The detector layout covering the whole
investigating area is usually not possible due to different reasons: economical, installation limitations,
precision requirements. Therefore, we need to find the optimal detector layout, which will provide us
with information about threat presence and/or separate threat carriers depending on the concrete goal.
If the goal of the whole system is to detect an emergence of a threat, than a layout of detectors should
be optimized in order to increase the probability of the threat detection. If the goal is to identify
concrete threat carriers, the system of detectors has to use measurements from different detectors in
order to increase a precision of identification. In this work the both purposes are considered: the
simultaneously increasing probability of threat detection and identification. However, the second task
of identification is the priority. The optimization process relies on the solution’s quality assessment
model, which depends on the optimization goal. In the case of identification this quality assessment
model has to estimate personal agents’ probability of being a carrier. This assumes the use of
information about pedestrian flows.
In the next sections the detector layout optimization framework is proposed.

4 Architecture of the optimization framework
The defined optimization problem operates with objects that have their own complex behavior:
agents, environment, detectors, and system of detectors. These behaviors should be simulated in order
to reproduce the complex system’s dynamics and in order to evaluate the solution’s performance. For
this purpose, the optimization framework relies on the system of models: agent-based crowd dynamics
model, detectors models, model of the complex detection system.

The solution obtained by the optimization process should be based on pedestrian mobility data
representing the real dynamics in a concrete spatial area (crowded place). This data can be taken from
both observations (e.g. pedestrian tracks caught by video cameras) or from microscopic models. A
large amount of pedestrian tracks acquired from observations could serve as the best means to
represent real people’s behavior. But a fully data-driven approach to pedestrian mobility analysis
cannot be applied in all cases due to various reasons, including absence of data because of high cost of
tracking infrastructure; availability of only partial observed macro-characteristics like crowd density;
the crowded place under investigation may not exist (e.g. in case of design). In these cases simulationbased data acquisition on pedestrian flows is performed. For this purpose the special agent-based
simulation engine is utilized. And one of this engine’s major requirements is support of integration of
various models, which define different aspects influencing pedestrian flows: virtual society models,
population mobility models, environment models, and external models.
The second important part of the framework is a single detector model. This model consists of a
few basic parts which determine its behavior as a reaction to an environment based on the virtual
society model, population mobility model, environment model, and external model. The screening
process sub-model determines how to treat group of agents who have passed the area around the
detector, and determines the probability of threat detection event.

Fig. 1. Scheme of the framework’s high-level architecture

System of detectors model simulates the behavior of the whole security system consisting of all
detectors. It aggregates information flows from separated detectors about individual agents.
Expression for personal aggregated probability of being a carrier is used in order to estimate the
probability of individual agents to be a threat carrier. Quality assessment model aggregates this
information to estimate performance of the overall detectors layout (whole system).
Basing on the listed models, the implementation of the framework consists of three main
components: PULSE agent-based simulation engine (Karbovskii, Voloshin, Puzyreva & Zagarskikh,
2014) data structure optimization module, detector layout optimization module based on a genetic
algorithm, and auxiliary optimization results’ analysis module, which includes interactive
visualization. It can solve the following tasks: rapid prototyping of different crowded place
topologies, features of pedestrian movement and behavior of agents specific for specialization of a
crowded place, data reorganization in a way efficient for investigation of settings important for the
optimization and accounting pedestrian flows influence for the system performance.

Agent-based simulation. Agent-based simulation provides a large amount of data on population
mobility within the spatial area under investigation. Several types of social models are incorporated
into the framework in order to represent agents’ behavior and interaction specific to a particular
scenario. Virtual society model represents socio-economic classes, roles, and mobility classes, which
determine the behavior of agents involved in the simulating scenario. Population mobility model
reproduce pedestrian movement dynamics in detail by incorporating navigation and collision
avoidance models. These models describe psychological, social, and physical forces which influence
each agent and forms agent's behavior according to the use case for detectors layout
optimization.(Fang, Qin, Lu & Zhao, 2012; Schadschneider & Seyfried, 2009; Seyfried &
Schadschneider, 2008). Environmental model represents investigating threat phenomenon, and, for
example, defines if the threat carrier can transmit a threat to other agents. It should be noted that the
real data on pedestrian tracks can still be used by the framework instead of simulation. It can be
incorporated into the models in frames of calibration in order to increase the accuracy of simulation.
Data structure optimization. The second part of the solution is the data processing module which
aggregates data coming from simulation engine and reorganizes it in order to reduce the solution's
quality assessment time within the optimization process. Before start of processing the set of potential
locations for detectors is specified. The module consumes the raw data generated by the simulation
engine, which contains information about each agent's position and state for every second of
simulation. The data related to adjusted space of each detector (detector has certain detection radius)
is aggregated and processed according to the model from Section 3. The first aggregation step is the
partitioning of geometric space of a crowded place into a grid. Then all the static spatial objects like
walls along with moving agents are distributed by their location to cells of the grid for each moment
of simulation time. Information about the agents, which fall into a detecting zone of sensors, is
selected depending on a detection radius. Results are merged according to collection interval of a
particular detector and aggregated according to global detection model. Finally, the data structure for
fast access to aggregated information by a set of values (detector id, collection interval, radius, agent
id) is formed.
Genetic algorithm. The third module is an optimization module containing implementation of
NSGA-2 multi objective genetic algorithm, which employs the quality assessment algorithm based on
the model from Section 3 as fitness. Genome is an ordered set of detector placement positions and
certain types associated with them. Mutation is a random change of one of the detectors in the set to
another detector position and associated type. Single point crossover with removing of duplicates is
used.
A description of the models and the framework’s implementation are given in the next sections.

5 Threat carrier’s detection and identification
Single Detector model. In order to get a flexible solution for the class of problems presented in the
Section 3, we introduce the generic detector model which is presented below.
Let introduce several definitions. ‫ ܦ‬ൌ ሼ݀݅ ǡ ݅ ‫ א‬ሾͳǡ ݊ሿሽ – set of detectors, ‫ ܣ‬ൌ ሼܽ݅ ǡ ݅ ‫ א‬ሾͳǡ ݉ሿሽ – set

(2)

Here ቀͳ െ ‫ ݅ ܾ݌‬൫‫ ݅ ܾݎ‬൯ቁ corresponds to the probability of not detecting a contribution from agent ܾ݅ . It
should be noted that every agent can have many location points which falls into detection area of a
detector. For the sake of simplicity the point with minimal distance to center of the detector will be
used to determine agent's contribution to the threat detection event probability. Thus, at the end of
collect interval detector ݀ reports: its location and characteristics, timestamps for current collect
interval݆݃ and signal of detection and data of agents which has crossed the detection zone if threat
has been found. It is assumed that identification of each agent whose trajectory has crossed a detection
zone during collect interval can be performed by RFID label or video cameras.
System of detectors model for identification. From the point of view of the detection system every
agent in the group seems to be equally suspicious due to the system can’t know exactly which agent is
a threat carrier after threat detection event has happened.
There can be different considerations how to determine probability of individual from the group
probability. One can be leaded by the following consideration. Let introduce the following events:
‫ – ܪ‬detector ݀ has found the threat after the end of collect interval ݆݃ , ‫ – ݅ ܨ‬agent ܽ݅ is a carrier. The
system, which looks for threat carrier, may assign personal agent's probability by the formula:

have equal probability to be a threat carrier so ‫ݐ݌‬൫ܾ݅ͳ ൯ ൌ ‫ݐ݌‬൫ܾ݅ʹ ൯‫ ʹ݅ ് ͳ݅׊‬and according to (1) we get
the final expression. This formula assumes that each agent in set B can be a threat carrier and
estimates its conditional probability to be a carrier (this model was chosen for the sake of simplicity).

݃‫ ݆ ݀ݒ‬is the collect interval, during which the agent ܽ݅ resides in an active zone of the detector ‫ ݆݀ݒ‬.
The formula (4) relies on precise knowledge of the detectors that have detected the threat. One way to
obtain this information is to simulate this detectors layout. This way comes with a high level of
stochasticity, which may require multiple runs and an aggregation of results. Thus, this way is
characterized by high computational complexity. The second way is to calculate a personal aggregated
probability for each possible subsequence of the sequence ‫ ݅ ܽ ݒܦ‬and probability the concrete
subsequence to appear. Then we can calculate mathematical expectation of a personal aggregated
probability. The computational complexity of this approach has an exponential growth depending on
the count of visited detectors. In some situations agents can have tens of visited detectors.

Nikolay Butakov et al.

We propose the following heuristic for estimation of personal aggregated probability, which has
reduced computational complexity. From the point of view of the detection system there can be two
outcomes: visited detector‫ ݆݀ݒ‬raises the detection event with the probability ܲ ‫ ݆ ݀ݒ‬ሺ݃‫ ݆ ݀ݒ‬ሻ; the detector

doesn’t raise an event with the probability ͳ െ  ܲ ‫ ݆ ݀ݒ‬ሺ݃‫ ݆ ݀ݒ‬ሻ. In this case mathematical expectation of
personal probability of agent ܽ݅ with detector ‫ ݆݀ݒ‬is:


This mathematical expectation is the personal probability, which can be assigned to the agent ܽ݅
by the system depending on all the probable outcomes. Substituting (5) into (4) we get the expression
of personal aggregated probability for the agent ܽ݅ :

Depending on the value of that probability, the system can decide to intercept and check the agent
or let it go. Let ‫ܥ‬ሺ݀݅ ሻ is a function, which determines cost of detector ݀݅ . So, the following

6 Experimental study
For the case study an issue of detectors layout optimization at the Pulkovo airport terminal (SaintPetersburg, Russia) is chosen. The terminal has high security requirements. At the same time it is
characterized by complex spatial topology and by complex pedestrian behavior forming flows within
the airport. The case study reproduces one regular day of the airport and takes into account the real
flight schedule. The simulation involves 4300 agents travelling through the 4-floor airport building.
The simulator generates routes for agents depending on their goals, which are defined by agent's role.
There are the following roles: arriving passengers, departing passengers, transfer passengers,
receiving individual, sending individual, personal of the airport, personal in commercial zones, taxi
drivers. Also, behavior of agents with the same role can vary depending on their social-economic
classes and stochastic selection of minor goals (e.g. visiting toilets). Two types of threat detectors
were used for the optimization. Detectors’ parameters of both types are presented in the table 1. An
abstract threat is considered in two experimental scenarios. In the first scenario threat can be carried
only by arriving passengers from planes (Scenario I). Total amount of threat carriers is set to 10% of
all agents. In the second scenario the source of threat is placed in the several places in the airport
(Scenario II). As a result about 50% of the agents became threat carriers leaving the airport. In order
to evaluate the proposed approach (GA) the results are correlated with an deterministic solution based
on maximal density coverage heuristics (DE). This solution implies use of the spatial points with the
maximum number of agents passing through it as places for detectors.
With the growth of the probability value count of such findings is decreasing. The threshold value
equal to 0.7 for Scenario II (Fig 7, right) give us a chance to precisely recognize more than 35 %
threat carriers. If the threshold with the value 0.45, for example, is chosen, the number of correctly
recognized treat carriers will be greatly increased and become more than 50%, but in the same time
the number of incorrectly recognized agents will become closer to 20%. It means, that will be 20% of
incorrectly recognized normal people who will be needed to be checked by security or other
appropriate service. Such a kind of tradeoff between degree of detection correctness and amount of
false-positive agents can be used in different situations. For example, if the goal is to detect in a
crowded place a sign of a treat presence , that can be infection, radioactive or chemical pollution,
security service may prefer to use threshold in the range of 0.2 and 0.3 to cover most part of
dangerous situations.

Solution based on density cover heuristic generates layout with detectors placed in the most
crowded points (e.g. entrances, gates). GA, in the opposite side, provides not obvious solutions
depending on the simulated scenario. In the figure 6 two solutions are presented for scenario II in a
case of 35 detectors limit. It should be mentioned that in Scenario I GA provides the different solution
and covers the most part of arrival area (floor 2), because threat carriers have the role of arriving
passengers. This shows the capability of the proposed approach to take into account behavioral
patterns of simulated crowd in the modeling scenarios. As a result GA produces more efficient
solutions. Performance of the two approaches can be compared with the use of receiver operating
characteristic(ROC) presented in the figure 8. The receiver operating characteristic, which presented
in the Fig 8, shows true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. We
can see that all the solutions provided by DE give worse results (farther away from the perfect point
(0.0, 1.0)) even than GA solutions consisting of low-quality sensors with large collection time
interval. The experimental study shows that the evolutionary process gain better performance (faster
convergence and better fitness) with use of density-based solution within the initial population than
just random generated population (Fig. 8, GA').
Relying on the obtained results (Fig. 8), it can be concluded that quality of a solution decreases
with the increase of the collect interval. Higher values of collect interval lead to more agents fall into
the active zone of the detector that affects . In case of threat detection it can be even preferable, as the
detector with larger group of caught agents has greater probability to raise alarm. But in case of
identification it would increase false positive rate and decrease true positive rate. Detectors with
different values of collect interval can be composed into one layout in order to balance between
identification goal and threat detection goal. For example, solutions of GA (Fig 7) use several
detectors with large collect interval in order to decrease the cost of the system by covering less used
passages and elevators at the third floor with the detectors.
The parameter study for detector count for Scenario II demonstrated that the best configuration
consists of 35 detectors. Also, it is observed that a lack of detectors in the system leads to poor
performance (e.g. in case of 15 detectors). But at the same time, too large amount of detectors
increases a level of noise and negatively affects on the precision of identification.

7 Conclusion and future works
In this work the detectors layout optimization framework is presented. Experimental study for
Pulkovo airport shows how it can be applied to solve such class of the detection problems. The quality
assessment model proposed in this paper is based on estimation of personal aggregated probability of
individual agents. It serves as a quantity measure for individual solutions during the optimization
process. Despite of the simplicity of the model it allows to take into account details of pedestrian
movements inside crowded place that may potentially lead to efficiency gains. Data structure
optimization helps to perform broad investigation of different settings that influence on performance
of detectors layout. Modularity and facilities for parallelization, which the framework provides,
incline to leverage more complex cases with bigger volumes of data. Conducted experimental study
shows that generated solutions can be better than ones provided by density-based heuristic. Future
research includes an extension and complexification of the case study under the investigation with
taking into account portable detectors. Using of such type of the detectors along with static detectors
can reduce cost of the whole detection system. Also mobile detectors could be used in an urgent mode
for rapid deployment of detection system in case of emergency. In this case optimization problem is
more complex and is intended to find optimal patrolling strategy. Another direction is to investigate
the capability of building plan correction within the optimization procedure in form of co-evolution.
The model of the system of detectors can be enhanced with use of probabilistic graphical models,

which are based on an interconnection of information flows about different detectors' decisions (e.g.
Bayesian networks model or Markov chains). As this approach relies on an implicit information from
different sources, it causes better precision of personal probability estimation. All the described above
extensions can be easily integrated to the proposed framework whose modularity is greatly suitable
for such cases.
