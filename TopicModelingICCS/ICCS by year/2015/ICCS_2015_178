Abstract
One-way coupling often occurs in multi-dimensional stochastic models in ﬁnance. In this paper,
we develop a highly eﬃcient Monte Carlo (MC) method for pricing European options under
a N -dimensional one-way coupled model, where N is arbitrary. The method is based on a
combination of (i) the powerful dimension and variance reduction technique, referred to as
drMC, developed in Dang et. al (2014), that exploits this structure, and (ii) the highly eﬀective
multilevel MC (mlMC) approach developed by Giles (2008). By ﬁrst applying Step (i), the
dimension of the problem is reduced from N to 1, and as a result, Step (ii) is essentially an
application of mlMC on a 1-dimensional problem. Numerical results show that, through a
careful construction of the ml-dr estimator, improved eﬃciency expected from the Milstein
timestepping with ﬁrst order strong convergence can be achieved. Moreover, our numerical
results show that the proposed ml-drMC method is signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than the mlMC
methods currently available for multi-dimensional stochastic problems.

Introduction

The rapid growth of ﬁnancial markets over the past few decades has spawned many intellectually
challenging problems. These problems have evolved from the simple one-factor Black-Scholes
(BS) model to highly-complex multi-factor models that capture crucial features of important
practical applications. For instance, pricing models for option contracts have been extended
from the BS model to include stochastic variance, e.g. via the very popular square-root CoxIngersoll-Ross (CIR) model [1], and/or a stochastic interest rate, e.g. via a one/two-factor
Hull-White model [2, 4, 3]. In addition, the ﬁnancial markets have become more diverse, with
trading not only of stocks, but also of many types of ﬁnancial derivatives. For example, crosscurrency interest rate derivatives have become increasingly important and are traded in large
quantities in Over-the-Counter markets [10, 8].
Since in practice, closed-form solutions rarely exist for most pricing problems, numerical
methods must be used. For high-dimensional (stochastic) models, the Monte-Carlo (MC) approach is very popular, due to the fact that the complexity of MC methods increases linearly

with respect to the number of dimensions. Using an ordinary MC approach, referred to as
ordMC, with a (time) discretization method having ﬁrst-order weak convergence, such as the
simple Euler-Maruyama, the computational cost to achieve a root-mean-square error (RMSE)
of is O( −3 ).
The multi-level MC (mlMC) approach, developed in [5], is based on the multi-grid idea for
iterative solutions of PDEs, but applied to MC path calculations. More speciﬁcally, the mlMC
approach combines simulations with diﬀerent numbers of timestep sizes to achieve the same level
of accuracy obtained by ordMC at the ﬁnest timestep size, but at a much lower computational
cost. It is well-known that the eﬃciency of the mlMC method primarily depends on the strong
convergence of the (time) discretization method (e.g. see [6, 7], among many others). With the
ﬁrst-order strong convergence Milstein discretization, to achieve a RMSE of , the computational
cost is reduced to O( −2 ), even for discontinuous and path-dependent payoﬀs. This oﬀers a
signiﬁcant saving compared to the simple Euler-Maruyama discretization which has only halforder strong convergence, and hence, O( −2 (log(1/ ))2 ) computational cost. As a result, there
has been much interest recently in the computational ﬁnance community in using mlMC with
the Milstein discretization. However, a disadvantage of the Milstein scheme is that, for multidimensional models, except in some special cases, it usually requires simulation of iterated
Itˆ
o integrals, also known as L´evy areas, and this is usually very slow. In [7], it is shown
that, through the construction of a suitable antithetic mlMC estimator, it is possible to avoid
simulating L´evy areas, but still achieve the overall complexity O( −2 ) for a RMSE of . To the
best of our knowledge, this is the only mlMC method currently available in the literature that
deals with multi-dimensional models. Note that this method still requires multi-dimensional
MC simulations.
Along a diﬀerent line of MC research, in [3], we develop a highly-eﬃcient and easy-toimplement dimension reduction approach for MC methods, referred to as drMC, for plain-vanilla
European options written on multi-dimensional stochastic models with one-way coupling. The
underlying idea of the drMC approach is to combine (i) the conditional MC technique, and (ii)
the derivation of closed-form solution of the conditional partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs)
via the Fourier transform. The drMC approach reduces the dimension of an N -dimensional (N dim) problem from N to 1, provided the model is suitably coupled. As a result, the variance
associated with the stochastic factors in the model, except that of the factor we condition on, is
completely removed from the option price. This often results in a signiﬁcant variance reduction.
In this paper, we present a highly eﬃcient ml-drMC pricing method for plain-vanilla European options based on multi-dimensional stochastic models with one-way coupling. The
ml-drMC method essentially consists of two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, by applying the drMC
method, we can reduce the dimension of an N -dim problem from N to 1. In the second stage,
we apply the multilevel technique with the Milstein discretization to the stochastic factor we
condition on in the ﬁrst stage. Under the drMC framework, however, the option price can be
expressed as an expectation of a non-conventional path-dependent payoﬀ, a fact that poses challenges in constructing a multilevel estimator that preserves the improved eﬃciency expected
from the Milstein discretization in the second stage. Nonetheless, we show that such a multilevel
estimator can be devised. As an illustration to the underlying idea, as well as to demonstrate
the eﬃciency and robustness of the ml-drMC method for some high-dimensional problems, we
present the ml-drMC method in a very general cross-currency context with stochastic variance,
multi-factor domestic and foreign short rates, and full correlations between factors.
We highlight two important potential advantages of the ml-drMC over the antithetic mlMC
method of [7] in this context. Due to the model dimension reduction from N to 1 of the
ﬁrst stage, the second stage is essentially an application of the multilevel technique to a 1dim problem, and hence, naturally avoids simulating L´evy areas. In addition, since the ﬁrst
stage also often results in a signiﬁcant variance reduction, it is expected that the ml-drMC is
1584

signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than the antithetic mlMC approach of [7]. As a result, the ml-drMC
method is (potentially) a signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient and better alternative to the antithetic
mlMC method of [7], provided that the models are suitably coupled. However, no convergence
proofs have yet been constructed for ml-drMC, and so the paper relies on the numerical results
to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the method.

Cross-currency model

We consider the following cross-currency model under domestic risk-neutral measure Q.
dS(t) = S(t) (rd (t) − rf (t)) dt +

ν(t) dWs (t)

Xi (t) + γd (t), dXi (t) = −κdi (t) Xi (t) dt + σdi (t) dWdi (t),

i=1

(1c)
ν − ν(t)) dt + σν
dν(t) = κν (¯

ν(t) dWν (t) .

(1d)

Here, S(t), rd (t), rf (t) and ν(t), respectively, represent the spot foreign exchange (FX) rate,
the domestic short rate, the foreign short rate, and the variance of the spot FX rate. The
spot FX rate is deﬁned as the number of units of domestic currency per one unit of foreign
currency. The functions κdi (t), σdi (t), i = 1, . . . , m, m ≥ 1, κfi (t), and σfi (t), i = 1, . . . , l,
l ≥ 1, are deterministic functions of t, with κdi (t), and κfi (t) being the mean-reversion rates.
The functions γd (t) and γf (t) are also deterministic, and they, respectively, capture the current
domestic and foreign term structures. They are deﬁned as
γi (t) = ri (0) e−κi1 t + κi1

t

e−κi1 (t−s) θi (s) ds ,

i ∈ {d, f } ,

(2)

0

where θi are deterministic, and represent the interest rates’ mean levels. The constants κν and
ν¯ are the mean-reversion rate and the long-term mean of the variance, respectively, and σν is
the constant instantaneous volatility of the variance process. Also, Ws (t), Wdi (t), i = 1, . . . , m,
Wfi (t), i = 1, . . . , l, and Wν (t) are standard correlated Brownian motions (BMs) under measure
Q with correlation matrix Q = [ρ]ij , i.e. Q is symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite. Note that the
“quanto” drift adjustments, −ρS,fi σfi (t) ν(t), for dYi (t), i = 1, . . . , l, come from changing
from the foreign risk-neutral measure to the domestic risk-neutral one. We emphasize the
generality of the cross-currency model (1a)-(1d), as well as its strong suitability for modeling
FX products, especially long-dated (maturities of 30 years or more) hybrid FX products, such
as Power-Reverse Dual-Currency (PRDC) swaps [2, 4].

Dimension reduction MC (drMC)

In this section, we brieﬂy review the drMC approach. The reader is referred to [3] for a detailed
proof of the approach and relevant discussions. One of the key steps in developing the drMC
approach is to decide which factor we should condition on. Given the way that the model (1)
is coupled, we can condition on either rd or ν.1 However, we choose to condition on ν, since
1 Note

that, due to the quanto term, ν is in fact coupled to rf , and hence we should not condition on rf .

Let z(t) = log(S(t)), 0 ≤ t ≤ T . We denote by V (z(t), t, rd (t), rf (t), ν(t)) ≡ V (z(t), t, ·) the

also denote by Vˆ (ξ, t, ·) and Φ(ξ)
the Fourier transforms of V (z(t), t, ·) and Φ(z), respectively.
For the rest of this paper, let the expectation and the variance operators be denoted by E(·)
and V(·), respectively. Also, the subscript {νt } is used to denote that the associated quantity is
conditional on the ν(t) path only, i.e. the quantity does not depend on the BM paths associated
with S, rd , or rf .
The ﬁrst step in the drMC approach is to derive the the conditional PDE in terms of z,
which can be expressed in the following form:

It is important to note that, due to the dependence of F{νt } , G{νt } , and H{νt } on the variance
paths, P is indeed a (non-conventional) path-dependent payoﬀ. As noted in [6], construction
of the multilevel estimator for path-dependent options requires special attentions in order to
achieve improved eﬃciency in the case of the Milstein discretization. We discuss this in the
next section.

Multilevel drMC (ml-drMC)

In the ml-drMC approach, we apply the multilevel technique to the variance factor ν(t), which

is driven by the BM W
For the simulation of ν(t), we use a drift-implicit Milstein scheme that preserves the positivity of
the original CIR model (1d), and has a good strong convergence property, recently established
in [9]. More speciﬁcally, given a timestep size h = T /N , the Milstein discretization of (1d) is

where νˆn denotes the discrete approximation at tn = nh, n = 0, . . . , N − 1, ΔWn = W (tn+1 ) −
W (tn ) = Normal(0, h), and νˆn+ = max(ˆ
νn , 0).
Consider multiple sets of simulations of ν(t) with diﬀerent timesteps sizes h = h = τT ,
= 0, . . . , L, and τ the reﬁnement factor, so level has τ times more timesteps than level − 1.
In all of our experiments, we use the reﬁnement factor τ = 2. For a given BM path W (t),
we denote by Pˆ , = 0, . . . , L, an approximation to the payoﬀ P , deﬁned in (13), using the
discretization scheme (14) with timestep size h . Note the key identity underlying the mlMC
method

We denote by Yˆ0 an estimator for E(Pˆ0 ), and by Yˆ , = 1, . . . , L, an estimator for E[Pˆ − Pˆ −1 ]

estimate each Yˆ , = 1, . . . , L, in such a way that, for a given computational cost, the variance
ˆ
of the combined estimator, namely
√ V(Y ), is minimized. As showed in [5], this can be achieved
by choosing M proportional to V h . Thus, the convergence of the sample variance V as
→ ∞ is very important to the eﬃciency of the methods, since it determines an optimal choice
of M , the number of sample paths used in each level. In the case of Asian options, which
have path-dependent payoﬀs, it has been shown in [6] that V = O(h2 ) when the Milstein
discretization method is used, but special treatments to the estimator must be applied.
For the rest of the paper, the super-scripts “f ” and “c” are used to denote the dependence
of the quantities on ﬁne and coarse levels, respectively. (This is not to be confused with the
sub-script “f ” used to indicate association with the “foreign” interest rate factor.) We now
discuss how to construct the estimator Yˆ for E[Pˆ − Pˆ −1 ] deﬁned in (16). The estimator Yˆ is
an average of M values from M independent path simulations. For each BM W (t) input, the
value is of the form Pˆ f − Pˆ c−1 , where Pˆ f is a ﬁne-path estimate using timestep size h = T /2 ,
and Pˆ c−1 is the corresponding coarse-path estimate using timestep size h = T /2 −1 . As showed
in [6], it is required that E[Pˆ f−1 ] = E[Pˆ c−1 ], so that the key identity (15) is satisﬁed. In the
case of European options, we can simply deﬁne Pˆ f−1 and Pˆ c−1 to be the same. In our case,
however, due to the path-dependency of the payoﬀ P , the deﬁnition of Pˆ c−1 needs information
from the discrete approximation of Pˆ f , which is not available when Pˆ f−1 is computed. This is
done in order to reduce the variance of the estimator, but the relation E[Pˆ f−1 ] = E[Pˆ c−1 ] must
be satisﬁed. Similar observations are made in [6] in the context of Asian options.
Now recall the coeﬃcients F{νt } , G{νt } , and H{νt } of the payoﬀ P , which are given in (9).

To compute these coeﬃcients, we need to evaluate the following stochastic integrals: 0 ν(t)dt,

Numerical results

For the numerical experiments, we consider a 6-D cross-currency model, i.e. model (1) with
m = l = 2. For simplicity, for the domestic and foreign two-factor HW models, we assume θd
and θf in (2)) are constant. Thus all the deterministic integrals in G{νt } , F{νt } and H{νt } can
be computed analytically. The quantities G{νt } , F{νt } and H{νt } deﬁned in (9) can further be
reduced. For brevity, we omit these reduced formulas, which can be found in [3].
For comparison purposes, we also implement an antithetic mlMC method combined with a
Milstein discretization scheme for the above 6D model, as developed in [7]. We refer to this
method as anti-mlMC. For this method, due to the non-linearity of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient in
the price process S(t), we work with log(S(t)) instead [7]. Following [7], given a timestep size
h = T /N , the Milstein scheme for the 6-D cross-currency model under consideration with the
L´evy area terms set to zero is given by:
log(Sˆn+1 ) = log(Sˆn ) + rˆd,n − rˆf,n − 0.5ˆ

Here, γi,n (t) as γi,n = (ri,0 − θi )e(−κi1 nh) + θi , i ∈ {d, f }. Details of the antithetic mlMC
technique for multi-dimensional problems discretized by the Milstein scheme, such as (20), are
discussed in [7], and hence omitted here. We note that, although the coeﬃcients of the variance
process are not Lipschitz continuous, and hence the assumptions in [7] are not satisﬁed, the
numerical tests show that the anti-mlMC performs well, and is able to achieve V = O(h2 ).
Similar convergence results are reported in [7] for the Heston model.
For the numerical experiments, we use the domestic and foreign term structures in [10]:
rd (0) = 0.02, κd1 = 0.03, κd2 = 0.03, σd1 = 0.03, σd2 = 0.03, θd = 0.02, and rf (0) = 0.05,
κf1 = 0.03, κf2 = 0.03, σf1 = 0.012, σf2 = 0.012, and θf = 0.05. The correlations are
ρS,d1 = 0.08, ρS,d2 = 0.08, ρS,f1 = 0.08, ρS,f2 = 0.08, ρS,ν = −0.02, ρd1 ,d2 = 0.12, ρd1 ,f1 = 0.12,
ρd1 ,f2 = 0.12, ρd1 ,ν = 0.15, ρd2 ,f1 = 0.12, ρd2 ,f2 = 0.12, ρd2 ,ν = 0.15, ρf1 ,f2 = −0.70, ρf1 ,ν =
0.15, ρf2 ,ν = 0.15. We also use S(0) = 10, K = 10. For the variance, we use κν = 0.5, ν¯ = 0.9,
σν = 0.05, ν(0) = 0.9, which are taken from [7]. We use long maturity with T = 20 (years),
which is highly challenging for practical applications.
In our subsequent discussions, we compare three MC methods, namely ml-drMC, drMC,
anti-mlMC. Here, drMC is the non-multilevel counterpart of ml-drMC. In addition, following
[5], we deﬁne the computational cost for each method as the total number of random numbers

anti-mlMC, the computational cost is computed as M0 +

where L is the

In Table 1, to illustrate the accuracy of the ml-drMC method, we present the option prices
obtained by these three methods, and the corresponding standard derivation for the case =
10−3 . We observed that the option prices obtained by all methods agree well.

based MC methods, namely ml-drMC and anti-mlMC, result in lines having slope -2, which
indicates that V = O(h2 ). This indicates that the improved eﬃciency expected from Milstein
scheme has been achieved for the ml-drMC method. Moreover, the V of the ml-drMC method
is about 50 times smaller than the V of the anti-mlMC method. This is expected, due to the
(possible) variance reduction in the drMC approach. We also note that the multilevel-based
methods are substantially more accurate than their non-multilevel-based counterparts. On level
= 2, which has just 4 timesteps, V of ml-drMC is already more than 1000 times smaller than
the variance of drMC (which is essentially V[Pˆ ]).
In Figure 1 (b), we investigate the computational costs of the three methods. We compute
the cost required by each method for diﬀerent values of . It is clear that the ml-drMC are
signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than the drMC and anti-mlMC methods. In particular, the ml-drMC

method is about 80 times more eﬃcient than the anti-mlMC method. The results from these
two ﬁgures indicate that ml-drMC can achieve the same second-order rate of convergence as
the anti-mlMC method of [7], but signiﬁcantly more eﬃciently.

Conclusion

In this paper, we develop a highly eﬃcient multilevel and dimension reduction MC method
for pricing plain-vanilla European options under multi-dimensional one-way coupled models in
ﬁnance. The method is based on two steps. First, by applying the drMC method, we can reduce
the dimension of an N -dim problem from N to 1. Then, we apply the multilevel technique with
the Milstein discretization on the stochastic factor we condition on, which is essentially an
application of the multilevel technique on a 1-dim problem. We have demonstrated numerically
that it is possible to achieve a second-order rate of convergence for the multilevel estimator with
Milstein discretiztion in the context of the drMC method. In addition, while having the same
rate of convergence as the antithetic mlMC of [7], the ml-drMC is signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient.
There are several major directions for future research. The ﬁrst is to establish the theoretical
analysis of the ml-drMC method presented in this paper for European options, and possibly
for discontinuous payoﬀs, such as those arise that in digital options. The second direction is
to extend the ml-drMC approach to include treatment of exotic features, such as early exercise
and barriers. The third direction is to handle model extensions, such as L´evy jump-diﬀusion
models. While mlMC methods for jump-diﬀusion models are available in the literature, an
important advantage of the ml-drMC over these mlMC methods is that the jumps can be
handled separately and very eﬃciently, via the Fourier transform technique applied to the
conditional Partial Integral-Diﬀerential Equations.
