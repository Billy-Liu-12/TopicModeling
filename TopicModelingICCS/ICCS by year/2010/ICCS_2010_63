To compute complex ﬂows with shocks it is very important to conserve total energy, which is deﬁned
as follows. The speciﬁc total energy,E, for axisymmetric ﬂow is

If initial and boundary conditions are speciﬁed appropriately, then the equations in cylindrical coordinates allow a spherically symmetric
√ solution. That is, density, internal energy and pressure depend only
upon the spherical radius (R = r2 + z2 , ρ(r, z) = ρ(R, t), ε(r, z) = ε(R, t), p(r, z) = p(R), and velocity can be
represented as u = U(R) sin ϕ, v = U(R) cos ϕ for coordinate systems represented in Fig. (2).
Boundary conditions for spherically symmetric problems are presented in Fig. 3.

that is ε = ε(R, t).
In this paper we present a new staggered discretization for 2D Lagrangian hydrodynamics in rz geometry on logically rectangular grid, which is compatible with described partial differential equations, that is,
total energy conserving and symmetry preserving.
We want to mention recent paper [3] devoted to cell-centered discretization of 2D Lagrangian hydrodynamics in rz geometry.
We show that our discretization preserves spherical symmetry on polar equiangular meshes. It has a
consistent deﬁnition of kinetic energy in the zone that is exact for a constant velocity ﬁeld.
The method is based on ideas presented in [2, 1], where the authors use a special procedure to distribute zonal mass to corners of the zone (subzonal masses). The momentum equation is discretized in its
”Cartesian” form with a special deﬁnition of ”planar” masses (area-weighted).
Two principal contributions of this paper are as follows: ﬁrst is a deﬁnition of ”planar” subzonal mass
for nodes on the z axis (r = 0) that does not require a special procedure for movement of these nodes.
Second is proof that the discretization preserves spherical symmetry including analysis internal energy
equation.
We present numerical examples that demonstrate the robustness of the new method.
2. Compatible staggered discretization
For simplicity of presentation, we will consider semi-discrete discretizations; that is we will keep time
continuous and consider only spatial discretization.
In this paper we consider logically rectangular grid, Fig. 4, where each point, p, can be enumerated by
two integer indices (i, j), and each zone, z, enumerated by two half indices i + 12 , j + 12 .
In the staggered discretization point quantities are coordinates, (r p , z p ), and velocity components, (u p , v p ).
Zonal quantities are volume, Vz , density, ρz , mass mz , internal energy, εz and pressure pz .
For Lagrangian methods: d(mz )/dt = 0 with mz = ρz |t=0 · Vz |t=0 . Therefore, for any time moment, t density
can be deﬁned as follows ρz (t) = mz /Vz (t), which plays the role of discrete continuity equation. Also for
Lagrangian methods each point moves with ﬂuid velocity, that is, d(r p )/dt = u p , d(z p )/dt = v p .

Zonal internal energy is E p = mz εz . Point momentum, μ p , and kinetic energy, K p , are deﬁned as follows
μp = mp up ,

Kp = mp

where point mass, m p , remains to be deﬁned.
There are following obvious requirements for point mass.
d(m p )/dt = 0 ;

mz =
z

mp .
p

Following [2], we introduce additional Lagrangian objects, so-called, subzonal masses, mzp , such that
d(mzp )/dt = 0 and
mzp = mz ,
(8)
p∈P(z)

where P(z) is set of vertices of zone z. Then point mass can be deﬁned as follows m p = z∈Z(p) mzp where
Z(p) is set of zones which have point p as vertex.
It is important to note that if one deﬁnes subzonal volume Vzp (t) in some consistent way, such that
p
p∈P(z) Vz (t) = Vz (t) , then it leads to natural deﬁnition of subzonal density
ρzp (t) = mzp /Vzp (t) .

(9)

The generic compatible form of the discrete momentum and internal energy equations is

p∈Z(p)

Therefore the spatial discretization is completely deﬁned if we deﬁne subzonal masses mzp and subzonal
forces fzp . In simplest case, which we will consider in this paper, subzonal force depends on the geometry
of the zone and zonal pressure.

For compatible discretizations, evolution of the total kinetic energy, K = p K p , is dK

3. Deﬁnition of subzonal masses
The discretization of momentum equation that preserves spherical symmetry is based on the nonconservative (”Cartesian”) form of the momentum equation
ρ

∂p

dt
∂r

(10)

This is equivalent to (2) in the differential case.
A control volume derivation of the discrete ”Cartesian” form of the momentum equation gives
du p
(fcart )zp ,
=
dt
z∈Z(p)

ρ A p (t)

(11)

where ρ A p (t) ≈ z(t) ρ(r, z, t) dr dz. The discrete form of ρ A p (t) is ρ A p (t) = z∈Z(p) (ρzp )(t) (Azp )(t) , where
(ρzp )(t) and (Azp )(t) remain to be deﬁned. For symmetry preservation it can be any symmetric quadrature
around the point. The necessary condition for zero order approximation is
(Azp )(t) = (Az )(t) .

(12)

p∈P(z)

The discrete equation (11) is not in compatible form, therefore to construct a conservative discretization we need to deﬁne (ρzp )(t) and (Azp )(t) in such a way that equation (11) can be rewritten in equivalent
compatible form:
du p
mp
=
fzp ,
(13)
dt
z∈P(z)
where m p corresponds to true cylindrical mass, V(t) ρ r dr dz. Comparison of (13) and (11) leads to following
deﬁnition of m p and fzp
⎛
⎞
⎜⎜⎜
⎟⎟⎟
p
p
⎜
m p = r p (t) ⎜⎜⎜⎝
(ρz )(t) (Az )(t)⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠ , fzp (t) = r p (t) (fcart )zp (t) .
(14)
z∈Z(p)

Using the notion of subzonal masses, we construct point point mass as follows
mzp ,

mp =

mzp = (ρzp )(t) r p (t) (Azp )(t) = (ρzp )|t=0 r p |t=0 (Azp )|t=0 .

z∈Z(p)

(15)

This leads to a natural deﬁnition of subzonal volume
Vzp (t) = r p (t) Azp (t) .

(16)

Equation (8) leads to the following requirement for Azp
(Vzp )(t) =
p∈P(z)

(r p )(t) (Azp )(t) = Vz (t) .

(17)

p∈P(z)

Therefore, we need to ﬁnd Azp (t) that satisﬁes two conditions (12) and (17). One of the possible solutions for
quad mesh as presented in [2] is:
A41 + 5 A12 + 5 A23 + A34

Figure 6: Deﬁnition of subzonal density for points on z axis

For points that are not on z axis, the subzonal volume Vzp deﬁned by equation (16) is positive and
therefore the subzonal density can be deﬁned using equation (9). However, for points on the z axis, mzp = 0
and Vzp = 0. Therefore we need to deﬁne the corresponding subzonal density using some other means. The
deﬁnition should satisfy some minimal requirements of consistency and also preserve spherical symmetry
on special meshes.
For a logically rectangular mesh, each point on the z axis is connected by a zone edge to only one point
that is not on the axis. For example, in Fig. 6 for point p on z axis such point is p− . In this situation we set
−

ρzp (t) = ρzp (t) .

(18)

It should be noted that such a deﬁnition of subzonal density does not affect the corresponding subzonal
mass which remains zero because the corresponding subzonal volume is zero.
Now let us consider how this modiﬁcation affects the logic of the compatible discretization. First, if we
deﬁne zonal kinetic energy as follows
mzp u p

Kz =
p∈P(z)

2

∼

ρ
Vz

up

dV

then the minimal consistency condition means that if u is constant then Kz should be exact. This is clearly
true in our discretization because of the deﬁnition of subzonal volumes.

Second, kinetic energy does not depend on the velocity of points on the z axis because the corresponding
mzp = 0. Therefore, movement of points on the boundary (which is affected by the deﬁnition of corresponding subzonal masses) does not contribute to instantaneous energy balance. Third, the deﬁnition of zonal
internal energy, Ez = mz εz , does not depend on mzp as long the corresponding mzp sum to mz , which is true in
our case. Therefore the logic of compatible discretization is not affected and our discretization conserves
total energy.
4. Discrete equations on logically rectangular grid
On logically rectangular grids, the discretization of ”Cartesian” forces follows from the deﬁnition of the
”Cartesian” gradient operator
A(t)

gradcart p dA =

p ndl ;
∂A(t)

Using notations for points and zones for such grids, we obtain the following expression for the subzonal

5. Preservation of spherical symmetry on an equiangular polar mesh

In this section we show that our new discretization preserves spherical symmetry on special equiangular polar meshes, Fig. 7 a).
Coordinates of points of such a mesh are deﬁned as follows
ri, j = R j sin ϕi ,

zi, j = R j cos ϕi ;
π/2
.
ϕi = (i − 1) Δϕ ; Δϕ =
I−1

i = 1, · · · , I ; j = 1, · · · , J ,

The statement of exact preservation of spherical symmetry on polar mesh can be formulated as follows.
Corresponding components of the velocity are equal to zero on axis: u1, j (t) = 0; vI, j (t) = 0. Both components
of the velocity are zero at the origin: u1,1 (t) = v1,1 (t) = 0. On the outer boundary, one can specify pressure
as the function of the time pi+1/2,J (t) = Ptop (t), or the normal component of the velocity as function of time
ui,J (t) sin θi + vi,J (t) cos θi = U(tn ).

Initial conditions for scalar functions are as follows: ρi+1/2, j+1/2 |t=0 = ρ j+1/2 |t = 0; pi+1/2, j+1/2 |t=0 = p j+1/2 |t=0 ,
εi+1/2, j+1/2 |t=0 = ε j+1/2 |t=0 . Initial velocity is directed radially and its magnitude depends only on j: ui, j |t=0 =
U j |t=0 · sin θi and vi, j |t=0 = U j |t=0 · cos θi .
If for these initial and boundary conditions, the density, internal energy and pressure depend only on
j and the velocity is spherical ui, j (t) = U j (t) sin θi and vi, j (t) = U j (t) cos θi at all later times, then we say that
the ﬁnite difference scheme preserves spherical symmetry.
On a polar equiangular mesh, the momentum equation can be written in the following form

where eRi = (sin ϕi , cos ϕi )T . Therefore, in the discrete case, acceleration is directed in the radial direction,
and its magnitude depends only on j, that is, the momentum equation preserves spherical symmetry.
Similarly, the equation for speciﬁc internal energy also depends only on radius

To numerically demonstrate the preservation of spherical symmetry, we present results for the so-called
Noh’s spherical problem calculated in cylindrical geometry [4]. This problem has been used extensively to
illustrate the difﬁculties of preserving spherical symmetry in cylindrical geometry. Initially the velocity is
directed radially inward with a magnitude of 1.0, the density is unity, and the internal energy is zero. In
Fig. 8 we present computational mesh at t = 0.6 and density. The numerical results clearly conﬁrm our
theory; that is, the numerical solution preserves spherical symmetry exactly.

6. Conclusion
We want to emphasize that methodology for construction compatible total energy conserving staggered
discretization for Lagrangian hydro in 2D rz coordinates described in this paper can be used for general
polygonal meshes. This generalization will be described in future paper. We also plan to perform more tests
especially on polygonal meshes to demonstrate robustness of our new method and compare our method
with other methods, for example, methods presented in [3].
