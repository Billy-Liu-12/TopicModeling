Abstract
This paper proposes a multi-subsystem fuzzy data envelopment analysis (MFDEA) model to evaluate mutual funds management
companies‚Äô core competence which is apparently characterized with both qualitative factors and quantitative factors. As the first
attempt of core competence analysis of mutual funds management companies in a financial market, we evaluate how close the
mutual funds management companies are to the best practices frontier, and analyze how they should manage their funds. An
empirical study of 32 mutual funds management companies in China leads to a meaningful analysis and some management
insights. The approach can also be applied to many other hard assessment and evaluation problems.

1. Introduction
Mutual funds have been one of the most popular investment instruments in China for the past 10 years. There are
more than 60 mutual funds management companies in China today. The competition is very serious among the
mutual funds management companies. Active investment management helps to keep markets efficient and to ensure
the flow of funds to the most successful enterprises, which plays an important role in the allocation of resources
within the economy. Therefore, management of mutual funds industry deserves much more attention, especially for
the eveluation of the funds management companies‚Äô core competence.
The core competence evaluation is actually a kind of multi-criteria evaluation problem. In this paper, we propose
a multi-subsystem fuzzy data envelopment analysis (MFDEA) model to eveluate mutual funds management
companies‚Äô core competence from both qualitative factors and quantitative factors. Each company is regarded as a
system with two subsystems. Our purpose is to optimize each company‚Äôs relative efficiency of its whole system and
two subsystems at the same time. While considering the whole system‚Äôs relative efficiency, tradeoffs between the
two subsystems are made. A fuzzy membership function for types of funds is embedded into inputs and outputs to
allow that each mutual funds management company may manage one or more types of funds with different risk and

return features, so as to make sure the evaluation is carried out with an equal premise.
DEA is an excellent system management tool. For a detailed discussion on the original DEA model, readers can
refer to Charnes and Cooper [1]. There have been several studies on mutual fund investment performance in which
DEA methodology is applied. Among those studies, Murthi, Choi and Desai [2], Choi and Murthi [3], McMullen
and Strong [4], Morey [5], Galagedera and Silvapulle [6], Luo and Wang [7], Zhao, Lai and Wang [8] , Zhao and
Wang [9] are referred. The motivation of the present study is derived from the circumstances faced by the mutual
funds management companies that performance evaluation should not be restricted solely to an assessment of
investment performance.
To the authors‚Äô knowledge, this is the first paper to analyse and examine the core competence‚Äôs relative
efficiency of mutual funds management companies in a financial market. From an academic perspective, the
particular contribution of this paper lies on the proposal of MFDEA model, as an improvement of fuzzy DEA model.
With the aid of MFDEA, we evaluate how much the mutual funds management companies‚Äô core competence differ
from each other, and analyze how they should manage their funds. An empirical study of 32 mutual funds
management companies in China leads to a meaningful analysis and some management insights. This approach can
be also applied to solve many other hard assessment and evaluation problems.
2. Core competence analysis for mutual funds management companies
Mutual funds management companies are institutions resorting expert knowledge and experience with capital
collected from investors to make investment decisions in a scientific portfolio principle and to pursue assets
increment so as to benefit fund holders as much as possible.
The paper ‚ÄúThe core competence of the company‚Äù [10] which is regarded as a classical reference for the core
competence, gives a definition of the core competence as follows: core competence is the knowledge accumulated in
the organization, especially the knowledge how to harmonize different production skills.
According to this definition, we can divide mutual funds management companies‚Äô core competence into two
parts which can be regarded as two subsystems.
2.1. Competence of investment and research
Core competence of a company should be established on the basis of core business. A mutual funds management
company‚Äôs core business is asset management. It gets return in course of detecting and managing risk. In this sense,
one of its essential characteristics is symmetry in risk and return. Mutual funds management companies never stop
measuring and appraising relationship between risk and return.
However, that is not enough. The development of return and risk is their persistence. Whether or not the
performance can be persistent gives more important information about investment research competence. Meanwhile,
steady investment team is important to guarantee investment performance persistence. Research is also strong
surpport for investment, including production of quality research reports, design of new fund products, and hence, is
powerful backing force of the core business.
2.2. Competence of marketing and service
Marketing is a basic practical activity to realize a company‚Äô s business objective and to enlarge the company‚Äôs
market shares continually. As for a mutual funds management company, marketing capacity influences asset scale
directly, and the capacity of resisting risk indirectly. On the other hand, mutual fund industry is a finanial service
industry; therefore, fund marketing capacity can be represented by the service to investors too.
Information disclosure is part of important content to represent service competence to rectify the information
asymmetry, including the management of risks and costs, the main stocks and bonds invested, warehouse stock, ect.
For investors, whether or not fund information is easy to get and whether or not the information is abundant and
complete are important signs of the service capacity.

To evaluate the core competence of mutual funds management companies, we have to make indicators clear and
construct concept models with the features we extracted above.
3.1. Risk measurement
When measuring risk of mutual funds in an emerging financial market, the VaR under asymmetry Laplace
distribution is an excellent tool [11]. Consequently, VaR under asymmetry Laplace distribution will be employed as
a measurement of mutual funds risk in this paper.
3.2. Weight for return and risk measurement
Scales reflect funds‚Äô historical performance to some extent, further to represent managers‚Äô investment
competence. Therefore, to some extent, returns weighted by scales are able to represent the mutual funds
management companies‚Äô investment capacity.
Considering that scales of most equity funds are larger than those of bond funds, and that for the most time,
equity funds are more profitable than the bond type of funds, if returns are only weighted by the scale, a bias will
much favor equity funds and against bond funds. To avoid this, type should be qualified and employed as another
weight for returns. A membership function is proposed in this paper to characterize funds‚Äô types.
A mutual funds management company always manages more than one type of mutual fund. Each type has its
own risk characteristics, which determine each type‚Äôs return characteristics.
Data in Table 1 shows that VaR value under asymmetry Laplace is the most distinct indicator to represent types‚Äô
characteristics. Therefore, we will construct types‚Äô member function with funds‚Äô VaR value.

where x is the VaR value of risk measurement. Obviously, it is a contrary sigmond function.

Fuzzy number Ci is employed to be another weight for returns. Suppose that mutual funds management company
j manages m mutual funds, the ith fund (i=1,‚Ä¶,m) belongs to type f, its type fuzzy number is C , and the ith fund‚Äôs
f

average scale is Si,t during term t with absolute accumulative net value return Ri ,t , then the company‚Äôs return
capacity can be defined as:

where C f is the average value of all the funds‚Äô fuzzy numbers in type f. Similarly, the following is an appropriate
measurement for a company j‚Äôs risk at term t

where C f is the fuzzy number of type f, VaRit is fund i‚Äôs VaR value during term t.
3.3. Stability of team
The management team‚Äôs stability is very important for funds management companies. In order to measure
managers‚Äô stability, the average tenure of managers in company j is denoted as Yj. The bigger Yj is, the better the
company j‚Äôs stability is.
3.4. Concept models for system and subsystems
According to the analysis of Section 2, investment research subsystem focuses on asset management competence
and its supporting factors, especially whether or not able to get better performance with lower risk level and cost;
marketing service subsystem focuses on competence and efficiency in market development, whether or not certain
cost can produce the corresponding market shares‚Äô expansion.
Since mutual funds management companies‚Äô core competence evaluation is actually the synthesis of two
subsystems evaluation, concept models can be set up following the law of efficiency investigation as Table 2.

3.5. Disposal of qualitative indicators
Among the criteria in the subsystem of marketing and service, the quality of information service is a qualitative
variable that needs to be quantified in the evaluation. Expert knowledge and judgement are applied in the disposal of
qualitative criterion here. Suppose the appraisal remark set to be V={V1 ,V2 ,V3 ,V4, V5}={very good, good,
general, bad, very bad} ( x ¬è V ) to measure the information service quality. The membership function is defined as:

then F~ V~R T is the fuzzy score of the criterion.
4. MFDEA model

4.1. Fuzzy DEA Model
The classical DEA model is fit to deal with only accurate numbers, not fuzzy numbers. Suppose that there are n
DMUs and each DMU j ( j 1, 2,, n) has m inputs and s outputs, Lertworasirikul et al. [12] proposed the following
fuzzy DEA model based on BCC model:
max »ùT y 0 ,
»¶,»ù

  »ùT Y
 t 0,
s.t. »¶T X

x ji and y jr are the fuzzy inputs and fuzzy outputs of DMU j ( j 1, 2, , n) . »¶ and »ù represent weight vectors of input
in m dimension and output in s dimension. DMU0 is the target DMU from DMU j ( j 1, 2, , n) .
Fuzzy DEA is a nonlinear program, Lertworasirikul et al. introduced an approach to transform fuzzy BCC model
into the following linear program by use of probability and D‰ã≠„™∫„´å„´ã:
max(»ùT y 0 )UE ,

(»¶ x 0 )D0 d 1,
»¶, »ù t 0,

where D , D 0 , D1 , D 2 avail themselves of D‰ã≠„™∫„´å„´ã level to convert the corresponding fuzzy numbers into exact numbers.
Hence, model (7) converts the fuzzy numbers into the corresponding interval numbers. It is easy to solve. For each
interval
number, its‚Äô upper boundary is denoted by ‚ÄúU‚Äù and its lower boundary is denoted by ‚ÄúL‚Äù. For example,
(»ù T ~
y 0 )UE represents the upper boundary of fuzzy number »ù T ~
y 0 on the level of E ‰ã≠„™∫„´å„´ã . Other denotations can be
interpreted correspondingly.
4.2. DEA model with subsystems
Suppose that there are n mutual funds management companies. Let the inputs of the investment research
subsystem and the inputs of the marketing service subsystem be denoted as sets IIndex I , IIndex S , and let their
a
a
a
outputs be denoted as sets OIndex I , OIndexS . Let A={I, S} denote the set of subsystems. X j ^ xij ` (i ¬è IIndex ) (a ¬è A)

represents the inputs of DMU j ( j 1, 2,, n) in subsystem a (a ¬è A) , and Y j ^ yrj ` (r ¬è OIndex ) (a ¬è A) represents the
outputs of DMU j ( j 1, 2,, n) in subsystem a (a ¬è A) . The corresponding weights are »¶ a , »ù a (a ¬è A) . The
corresponding weights are »¶a , »ù a (a ¬è A) . With the CCR model [13], we model the investment research subsystem
and the marketing service subsystem respectively. Program (8) is for the subsystem of investment research. Another
system can be modeled by linear program (9).

To evaluate a mutual funds management company‚Äôs core competence, a natural thought is to begin with the
evaluation of each subsystem, followed with averaging the scores of the two subsystems, which can be expressed by
the following linear program:
max ¬¶ »ù aT Y0a ,
a¬èA

s.t. »¶ aT Xaj  »ù aT Yja t 0, j 1, 2,, n,
»¶ aT Xoa

»¶ aT , »ù aT t 0, a ¬è A.
»ù
Thus, the system score ¬¶
a¬è A

aT

can be optimized as follows:

max ¬¶ »ù aT Y0a ,

However, there is a close relationship between the subsystem of investment research and the subsystem of
marketing service. The main limitation of model (11) is to neglect each subsystem. We consider the following model
to optimize both the whole system and subsystems coinstantaneously:
max ¬¶ »ù aT Y0a ,

parameter E a is based on two reasons: (1) to make tradeoff between the subsystems; (2) E a allows experts to use
their knowledge/judgement. For example, if experts think the subsystem of investment research more important than
the another, then let E I ! E S ; similarly, if E a is equal to

1
2

, then it represents equal opinion of experts on the

a

two subsystems. Generally, E should not be valued as 0 or 1 because it means one of the subsystems is totally
ignored. This is unreasonable. Moreover, the model guarantees the whole system‚Äôs relative efficiency if both the
subsystems are relatively efficient. Model (12) adopts the same hypothesis of variant returns to scale with BCC
model [13].
4.3. Multi-subsystem fuzzy DEA model
We combine fuzzy DEA model with multi-systems. It not only manages to settle the evaluation problems with
both exact numbers and fuzzy numbers, but also manages to take into full consideration of mutual funds
management companies‚Äô features as follows:

5. Empirical study

The mutual funds industry in China has been developing rapidly in recent years. There are more and more mutual
funds and funds management companies in China. An empirical study is carried out to investigate the core
competence of funds management companies in order to get meaningful insights.
We use balanced panel data of 32 mutual funds management companies from year 2004 to 2008 (164
observations). Types‚Äô judgment is based on funds‚Äô VaR value under asymmetry Laplace distribution in the recent 3
years. The data comes from Tianxiang System for Investment Analysis and 105 copies of investigation
questionnaires collected. The evaluation results with MFDEA model are shown in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, 21 companies are relatively efficient among the 32 mutual fund companies, 15 companies
are efficient in investment research subsystem and 4 companies are efficient in marketing service subsystem.
Obviously in China, more than half of the mutual funds management companies‚Äô core competence are cultivated
soundly. However, the marketing and service competence is dispersed greatly within the industry, which indicates
that the competition in current Chinese mutual fund market is led by clients service and marketing service instead of
asset management capacity. This is the main reason of core competence differences.
The evaluation results also indicate that Company Gongyinruixin and Company Changcheng are good at
marketing and service, but weak in investment and research. Company Jiashi is the only one to be relative efficient
in both the whole system and subsystems.
It is explicable in the reality. Actually, as one of the first batch of fund companies established in China, Company
Jiashi has launched 12 mutual funds and built up a complete product system of open-end funds. It has a long history
with a lot of experience in asset management. It is also the first one to propose its brand strategy, and hence,
investors regard this company as far-sighted and steady advanced. It is also the only one to be able to keep better
performance over the average in the past 5 years due to its moderate management. Funds such as Taihe, Wenjian,
Jiashi, etc. which are under the management of Company Jiashi have provided excellent returns to their investors.
Once, Fund Jiashi Celuechengzhang collected RMB 40 billion Yuan on its first day, which not only made Jiashi
Fund Company the biggest mutual funds management company in China instantaneously but also brushed the
initial subscription scale record in the mutual funds industry of China. Obviously, the evaluation model‚Äôs results
accord with the fact.
Marketing has to be guaranteed by service. When significant effect of sheep flock results in similar investment
returns, service will become as importance as or even more than investment performance. Since the competition is

serious in the market, mutual funds management companies have to provide good service as well as good products
to attract investors and retain them, besides improving returns.
As a part of the financial service industry, mutual funds management companies‚Äô brands are formed gradually in
course of marketing and service. Good service helps to attract more clients and to strengthen their faithfulness, in
order to settle solid foundation for future asset scale and upstanding business status.
In addition, good service is able to boost enterprise‚Äôs social image, which also favors a company‚Äôs long-term
development. The more clients acquire for fund products and financial service, the larger the company‚Äôs market
appreciation is, the more satisfied investors will be with it. This leads to good competition competence.
6. Conclusions

Study on core competence eveluation of mutual funds management companies is a newly emerging area of
research in financial management, strategic management and operations management. However, the management of
mutual funds has long been the subject of assessment in the context of delegated portfolio management. In this
paper, for the first time, we extend an assessment to funds management companies‚Äô core competence evaluation.
With thorough investigation and analysis of mutual funds industry, we consider mutual funds management
companies‚Äô core competence into two parts: investment research competence and marketing service competence,
included within an whole evaluation system.
We propose a multi-subsystem fuzzy DEA model as an improvement of fuzzy DEA model of Lertworasirikul et
al. [12], with wich we solve this hard evaluation problem.
An empirical study is conducted with 32 mutual funds management companies in China. The results find that,
those companies display relatively high managerial skills for the most part, but competences differ a lot among
themselves in marketing and service. Marketing service competence is the main reason of this gap. Some companies
lag because of too small scale or too slow rate of scale increasing. One or two companies are good at marketing
service but weak in investment research. The empirical study also testifies the multi-subsystem fuzzy DEA model‚Äô
feasibility and reliability in mutual funds management companies‚Äô core competence evaluation.
This study of mutual funds management companies‚Äô core competence evaluation has made some important
discoveries and draw management insights, not only academically but also commercially. It helps the mutual funds
management companies to urderstand their own advantages and shortcomings and tells them how to improve their
core competence in future.
