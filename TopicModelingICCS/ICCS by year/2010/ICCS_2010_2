Abstract
Despite the active exploration of linear and nonlinear modeling of exchange rates, there is no consensus on the
optimal forecasting model other than the traditional random walk and ARMA benchmark models in the literature.
Given the increasing recognition of heterogeneous market structure, this paper proposes an alternative Slantlet denoising based hybrid methodology that attempts to incorporate the linear and nonlinear data features. The recently
emerging Slantlet analysis is introduced to separate the linear data features as it constructs ﬁlters with varying lengths
at diﬀerent scales and has more appealing time localization features than the normal wavelet analysis. Meanwhile,
the Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) is used to model and correct for the empirical errors nonlinear
in nature. As empirical studies were conducted in the Euro exchange rate market, the performance of the proposed
algorithm was compared with those of benchmark models including random walk, ARMA and LSSVR models. The
proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark models. More importantly the proposed methodology explores and
oﬀers deeper insights as to the underlying data generating process.

1. Introduction
As one of the most important economic factors for the national economy in the increasingly open and globalized
economic system, the accurate and reliable forecasting of the exchange rate movement has profound impacts throughout diﬀerent levels of the economy. In practice, it aﬀects various monetary and foreign exchange decision making
process of the government. It also inﬂuences diﬀerent operational decision making process and the hedging behaviors
of individual ﬁrms. For academics, it is closely related to some important theoretical issues in the economics and
ﬁnance ﬁelds such as Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and the Derivative Pricing, etc.
Despite the signiﬁcant interests received, exchange rate forecasting remains one of the most challenging issues in
the ﬁeld of economics and ﬁnance. Since the seminal work by Meese & Rogoﬀ, traditional linear structural models

have largely failed to demonstrate competent forecasting performance in empirical studies [1]. Part of the reason
is attributed to the nonlinear data characteristics uncovered in the recent empirical studies, which shed light on the
research of more accurate characterization and prediction of exchange rate movement. The use of nonlinear models
is now perceived as the key to the further performance improvement of exchange rate forecasting models. This
approach is mainly led by the adoption of diﬀerent distribution free artiﬁcial intelligence techniques such as neural
network and support vector regressions. However, they are mainly black box in nature and oﬀer little insights into
the underlying patterns as well as supporting theories behind. Recently the computational harmonic theory and the
denoising theory have provided the alternatives as they both take data driven approach and have tractable theoretical
foundations. Besides, they provide alternative view consistent with the emerging Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis
(HMH), where heterogeneous agents are recognized market forces in contrast to the homogeneous agents assumption
behind majority of time series models in the literature [2].
Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid methodology, incorporating both linear and nonlinear data characteristics
during the modeling process. The novelty is how these features are separated and modeled. The linear data feature is
extracted using the Slantlet analysis recently introduced in the harmonic analysis ﬁeld and modeled by Autoregressive
Moving Average (ARMA) model. The nonlinear data feature, represented by the empirical forecast errors, is modeled
by Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR). Therefore, the proposed Slantlet denoising based hybrid model
improves the forecasting accuracy as a result. Empirical studies in the representative Euro market were conducted to
support the superior performance of the proposed models against conventional benchmark models.
The contributions of this paper are documented in the following three aspects: Firstly, this paper argues that
inappropriate or inadequate removal of noises could result in lower goodness of ﬁt and previous failure of mainstream
exchange rate models. The parameters for the denoising algorithm is critical to the performance of the proposed
hybrid methodology and deserves special attentions. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, there are few researches
identiﬁed exploring the potential of Slantlet transform, an improved wavelet functions that employs more appealing
features but receives relatively less attentions, in the forecasting literature [3, 4, 5]. This paper represents one of few
attempts to explore application of Slantlet based denoising algorithm and use it as the basis for constructing hybrid
algorithm to further improve the modeling accuracy in the ﬁeld of exchange rate forecasting. Thirdly, previous hybrid
approaches mostly uses nonlinear models to correct for the error speciﬁcation of the linear models ﬁtted to the original
data directly [6]. However, the linear models may be biased during the ﬁtting process as their assumptions are violated
by the original data with mixture of both linear and nonlinear data features, which leads to distortions in the empirical
errors calculated and further biases in the nonlinear models estimated. The proposed model in this paper removes
the noises using Slantlet analysis before the linear models are ﬁtted to improve the validity of linear models in this
setting. The nonlinear LSSVR is used to model the nonlinear components from the empirical modeling errors. This
is a paradigm shift that improves the ﬁtting accuracy of diﬀerent models and further the forecasting accuracy.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: section 2 covers relevant theories and literatures, including Slantlet analysis, time series models and LSSVR models. Section 3 proposes a novel hybrid Slantlet Denoisong Least
Squares Support Vector Regression (SDLSSVR) methodology. Major ﬁndings and performance evaluations results
are reported in section 4. Section 5 summarizes and provides some concluding remarks.
2. Relevant Theories
2.1. Slantlet Analysis
Slantlet transform is an orthonormal transform that deﬁnes a continuous function over L2 space with shorter
support and retains the same level of vanishing moment [7]. This is achieved by employing a ﬁlterbank approach than
the traditional tree based approach, with ﬁlters of diﬀerent lengths at diﬀerent scales. The methodology gives it more
ﬂexibility in designing ﬁlters that target diﬀerent data features, in the spirit of multi wavelet analysis. In the case of
Slantlet analysis, the desirable feature is shorter support, which gives it the improved time frequency localization upon
the Haar wavelet counterpart.
The ﬁlter banks in the Slantlet analysis is determined by solving variables (parameters) in (1)

fi (n) =

c0,0 + c0,1 n f or n = 0, .., 2i − 1
c1,0 + c1,1 n f or n = 2i , ..., 2i+1 − 1

The solution to (1) is solved by subjecting (1) to several constraints. All three functions need to satisfy the
unit form condition and orthogonality to their shifted time reverse condition. Both gi (n) and fi (n) functions need to
annihilates linear discrete time polynomials [7].
2.2. Time Series and Least Squares Support Vector Regression Models
The random walk model is closely related to the Eﬃcient Market Hypothesis. It is based on the notion that all
past information is reﬂected in the current price, which is the only needed information to forecast future movement.
Random walk is a special case of more general ARMA with (0,1,0) structure. The ARMA model is based on the
autocorrelation data feature widely recognized in the ﬁnancial market. Mathematically ARMA model is deﬁned as in
(2).

θ(L) = 1 + θ1 L + θ2 L2 + ... + θm Lm

Where both φ and θ are lag operators for the autoregressive coeﬃcients and moving average coeﬃcients respectively. μ is the white noise (innovation).
Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) is the least squares version of Support Vector Regression,
which is an emerging nonlinear regression model based on statistical learning theory. Compared to traditional neural
network based approach, its solution is more stable and global optimum. This results from the adoption of the
same structural risk minimization principle during the data training and learning process. Thus it would alleviate the
overﬁtting and local minima issue with the traditional neural network models based on the empirical risk minimization
principle [8]. Compared to the quadratic programming approach used in SVR, LSSVR solves a system of linear
equations with equality constraints and achieves higher level of computational eﬃciency when dealing with large
scale data.
Using kernel functions that satisfy the Mercer condition, the nonlinear data are mapped into higher dimensions
using kernel tricks and a typical regression problem is formulated accordingly as in (3).
y = f (x) = sign[ωT φ(x) + b, φ : Rn → F, ω ∈ F]

Where φ(x) is the feature space mapped from the nonlinear input space x. ω and b are coeﬃcients.
A slack variable ei is introduced to model the estimation error, thus the LSSVR is formulated as in (4).

3. A Slantlet Denoisong Least Squares Support Vector Regression Hybrid Methodology
The Slantlet denoising hybrid methodology is based on the ’Divide and Conquer’ principle. It uses the Slantlet
analysis to disentangle the underlying Data Generating Processes (DGPs) in the time scale domain, consistent with
the Heterogeneous Market Hypothesis (HMH). The complex problem of modeling mixture of linear and nonlinear
data characteristics in the original time series data are divided into smaller issues with the help of orthonormal transformation and denoising techniques, which are conducted in a distribution free manner with data integrity retained.
SDLSSVR hybrid methodology involves the following key steps.
1. The deterministic data are extracted from the original time series using Slantlet analysis at the chosen decomposition level, as in (7).
rt−1 = rt−1,data + rt−1,noises

(7)

Where r( t − 1), rt−1,data and rt−1,noises refer to the original, denoised and noises return data series respectively.
During the denoising process, the Slantlet analysis is used to project the original data into several sub data series
in the time scale domain. The coeﬃcients at diﬀerent scales from the Slantlet analysis are ﬁltered using the
shrinkage strategy. During the shrinkage process, the threshold level is calculated with the threshold selection
strategy, when the boundaries between data and noises at diﬀerent scales are set. The denoised data are then
reconstructed from the projected data points.
There are diﬀerent denoising strategies proposed in the literature. The dominant ones include Universal, Minimaxi and Steins Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) [9]. The diﬀerence among these threshold selection rules is
the trade oﬀ set between smoothness and accuracy to achieve for the denoised data. E.g. the Universal threshold
selection rule minimizes the noise levels given that the noises are normally distributed. The minimaxi threshold
selection rules minimizes the function ﬁtness criteria such as Mean Square Error (MSE). Shrinkage algorithm
are also proposed to govern the noise removal strategies once the noises are separated following speciﬁc threshold selection strategies. There are mainly two approaches: hard and soft shrinkage methods [9]. Both hard
and soft shrinkage methods remove the projected data points smaller than the threshold value for that scale.
However, the soft shrinkage method subtracts the set threshold value from the remaining projected data points
while the hard shrinkage method leaves them intact. The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a critical parameter to the calculation of threshold selection rules as it measures and controls the volatility level of noises. It is
median(|c0 |,|c1 |,...,|c2n−1 −1 |)
, where c is the Slantlet coeﬃcients [10]. There are two approaches to
calculated as σmad =
0.6745
calculate MAD parameter, i.e. sln or mln. The sln estimates the threshold level using the coeﬃcients at the ﬁrst
scale only while the mln estimate the threshold level in a level dependent manner [11].

using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method, as in (8).

the model ﬁtting process, the most parsimonious model orders are determined by minimizing the information
criteria, i.e. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [12, 13].

as in (10).

4. Empirical Studies

4.1. Data Set and Descriptive Statistics
We use the data set containing 1494 daily observations for Euro against US dollar, from 1 July, 2002 to 24 March,
2008, which starts from the stabilization of Euro since its oﬃcial introduction. The data set covers some turbulent time
period with major global events such as the second gulf war, SARS, bird ﬂu, etc. so that the predictive accuracy of the
model is stress tested through diﬀerent market scenarios for its generalizability. The data set for the original daily price
quotes is prepared and obtained from Global Financial Data. Following convention in the literature, the data set is
further divided into the training set and test set by 60-24-16 ratio. The ﬁrst 60% data is used as the in-sample training
set for ARMA model. The next 24% is reserved as the training set for LSSVR model. And the ﬁnal 16% data, which
amounts to statistically signiﬁcant 239 out-of-sample observations, is reserved as the test set to evaluate the predictive
accuracy of diﬀerent models out-of-sample. As Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function
(PACF) Analysis suggest there are indications of uprising trend, the original daily observations are transformed into
daily returns as in yt = ln ppt−1t . The descriptive statistics are listed in table 1.

There are some stylized facts from the descriptive statistics in table 1. It indicates that the Euro market is a

test of normality show that the market deviates from the normal distribution [14]. The acceptance of BDS test of
independence suggests that prices in the market is independently distributed [15]. However, the statistical signiﬁcance
of the results of these two tests are weak and inconclusive. When both data and noises components are extracted
from the original data, the descriptive statistics shows some interesting ﬁndings. The denoised data show signiﬁcant
leptokurtic, i.e. fat tail, behavior. The null hypothesis of both Jarque-Bera and BDS test are rejected at statistically
signiﬁcant levels. Meanwhile, the distribution of noises is normal, as indicated by the acceptance of the null hypothesis
of BDS test at the medium level of statistical signiﬁcance. However, the null hypothesis of BDS test is rejected,
indicating that there is unknown serial correlations.
4.2. Experiment Results
Following convention in the literature, the performances of diﬀerent models are evaluated based on statistical
measure tested on the out-of-sample data set. These include Mean Square Error (MSE), Clark-West test of predictive
accuracy, Pesaran-Timmermann test of directional predictive accuracy [16, 17, 18]. The null hypothesis for the ClarkWest test is equal predictive accuracy of the benchmark and competing models [16, 17]. The null hypothesis of the
Pesaran-Timmermann test is that the actual and predicted values of variables are independent of each other [18]. The
benchmark models used include Random Walk model, ARMA and LSSVR models [1, 19].
The lag order for ARMA model is determined based on the AIC and BIC minimization principle. The lag order for
ARMA model ﬁtted for the original data series is (1,1). For Slantlet analysis, the model speciﬁcation and parameters
are determined using trail and error method as follows: the decomposition level is set to 9, the rolling window is set to
512, the lag order for the ﬁtted ARMA model is (1,1), the threshold selection rule chosen is Minimaxi, the shrinkage
algorithm chosen is hard. For LSSVR model, model speciﬁcation and parameters chosen are determined using the
Grid Search method as follows: For LSSVR ﬁtted for the original data, the kernel chosen is Radial Basis Function
(RBF) kernel, the penalizing parameter λ is 0.02905, the σ for RBF is 0.074445. For LSSVR ﬁtted for the separated
noises data, the kernel chosen is Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, the penalizing parameter λ is 0.3629, the σ for
RBF is 0.8833
Table 2 lists the predictive accuracy for diﬀerent models, in terms of both MSE and Clark-West test against ARMA
and RW model. The subscript sln refers to the denoising algorithm with threshold estimated based on the ﬁrst level
coeﬃcients. The subscript mln refers to the denoising algorithm with threshold estimated in a level dependent manner.

Experiment results in table 2 show that the proposed Slantlet based hybrid approach, i.e. both SDLSSVRmln
and SDLSSVRmln outperform the traditional benchmark models, in terms of forecasting accuracy measured by MSE.
Compared to ARMA, RW and LSSVR model, SDLSSVR achieves lower MSE. The performance gap is statistically
signiﬁcant as suggested by the rejection of the null hypothesis for Clark-West test, i.e. the null hypothesis of equal
predictive accuracy of benchmark models against competing models is rejected. The p value for the performance
of both SDLSSVR sln and SDLSSVRmln against ARMA are less than the cutoﬀ value 0.05 while their performance
against RW model is near 0.05. Among models tested, SDLSSVR sln achieves the best performance. Due to the nested
nature of the proposed model with the benchmark models, the performance improvement is attributed to the use of
Slantlet analysis to separate the data from noises in a ﬁner manner and the use of diﬀerent model speciﬁcations, both
linear and nonlinear, for separated data of diﬀerent characteristics.

Meanwhile, although the Slantlet desnoising ARMA model have already led to the improved performance, the
introduction of LSSVR into SDLSSVR algorithm to model the noises component lead to further performance improvement. It can be seen from experiment results in table 2 that SDARMA fails to beat the RW model while
SDLSSVR performs much better and beats the RW model at statistically signiﬁcant level. This implies that the denoising process through Slantlet transform alone failed to capture and passed over some nonlinear data into the ﬁltered
noises components. The proper modeling of these nonlinear data patterns is critical to the further performance improvement. Meanwhile, this approach is also motivated from the analysis on the descriptive statistics of noises data
component. The descriptive statistics and Jarque Bera test of normality both support the normality assumptions of the
noises distribution. However, the ﬁnding that the BDS test of independence is rejected at the statistically signiﬁcant
level suggests that there is unspeciﬁed serial correlation among data observations, which is nonlinear in nature.
Experiment results in table 2 also conﬁrms that the performance of the conventional ARMA demonstrate inferior performance to the forecasting accuracy of the Random Walk based approach, as reported in the literature [1].
However, the superior performance of the ARMA model with appropriate denoising algorithm, i.e. SDARMA model,
suggests that the inferior performance is caused by the violation of assumptions of ARMA by the noises contaminated
data. The superior performance of SDLSSVR suggest that there are patterns in the exchange rate market to be exploited with the utilization of appropriate models for certain data features. E.g. the linear data pattern can be modeled
with ARMA when nonlinear noises are properly removed. This observation casts doubts on the EMH and provide the
supporting evidence to the alternative market hypothesis such as Homogenous Market Hypothesis (HMH) and Fractal
Market Hypothesis (FMH), etc.
Meanwhile, we also investigate the model performance in forecasting the direction of exchange rate movement,
which has signiﬁcant implications in trading activities. Table 3 lists the directional predictive accuracy for diﬀerent
models, in terms of both predictive success ratio, i.e. Dstat, and the results of Pesaran-Timmermann test.

Experiment results in table 3 show that the Slantlet denoising algorithm could lead to signiﬁcant performance
improvement in directional forecasting accuracy. The SDARMA sln improves the performance against ARMA model.
The directional forecasting accuracy is statistically signiﬁcant with p value less than 10%, where the null hypothesis
for Pesaran-Timmermann test, i.e. actual and predicted values of variables are independent of each other, can be
rejected. However, the other models only achieve inferior performance.
Interestingly, instead of the best performing model SDLSSVR sln in terms of predictive accuracy, the best performing model overall is SDARMA sln , in terms of both level predictive accuracy and directional predictive accuracy. All
other models including LSSVR, SDARMAmln , SDLSSVRmln and SDLSSVR sln achieve inferior directional predictive
accuracy. This suggests that the data may contain more complicated structure that merits further development of
theories and techniques to understand.
Another interesting ﬁnding is that experiment results show that generally the performance of sln based models are
superior to mln based ones. One possible explanation for the inferior performance of level dependent based denoising
algorithm is that the thresholds set at higher scales are inappropriate and may jeopardize important data features.
The thresholds for each scale are 0.0057, 0.0069, 0.0050, 0.0044, 0.0114, 0.0147, 0.0102, 0.0123 and 0.0044. It’s
obvious that the threshold for the ﬁrst scale 0.0057 is signiﬁcantly lower than thresholds at 4 higher scales, i.e. scale
5, 6, 7 and 8. Thus there are fewer coeﬃcients at higher scales processed to remove noises using the threshold
level estimated from ﬁrst scale coeﬃcients than those level dependent ones. The superior performance for sln based

algorithm suggest that the denoising algorithm with threshold estimated on ﬁrst scale coeﬃcients is preferred, and
imply that the threshold levels set at higher scales may be inappropriate. Therefore, we argue that the performance of
the Slant denoising algorithm is sensitive to the estimation method of threshold level, which is less explored issue in
the literature. The widely used parameters set such as level dependent threshold method mln may not always lead to
superior performance when the basic distribution assumption of noise is violated in the higher scale domain.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, a novel Slantlet denosing Least Squares Support Vector Regression model has been proposed for
exchange rate prediction. Following the HMH, we found that using Slantlet analysis to combine the linear modeling
of fundamental trend and nonlinear modeling of forecast noises data series lead to a hybrid algorithm with superior
performance against other alternatives. In the proposed SDLSSVR model, the denoising algorithm is used to separate
the underlying Data Generating Process (DGP) of diﬀerent characteristics, based on the fundamental noises and data
distributional assumptions. The Slantlet analysis is used to conduct the denoising process in the time scale domain,
incorporating the multi scale heterogeneous structure and the removal of noises nonlinear nature. The LSSVR model
is used to correct for the error speciﬁcations during the forecasting process. The performance comparison results
show that the proposed SDLSSVR algorithm outperforms the traditional benchmark models in terms of predictive
accuracy while overall the proposed SDARMA achieves the best performance in terms of both level and directional
predictive accuracy. As the proposed algorithm is nested with the benchmark models, the performance improvement
can be attributed to the proposed hybrid strategy that extracts distinct data features and the improves the modeling
accuracy for them as more appropriate model speciﬁcations are chosen with better behaved sub data set. In contrast
to the results from the seminal work by Meese & Roguﬀ, our results show that statistically signiﬁcant evidence of
out-of-sample predictability exists in the exchange rate market.
