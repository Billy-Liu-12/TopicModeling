Abstract
Macroscopic and microscopic modeling have become mainstream methodologies for crowd simulation in dynamic
environments. The two models make a trade-oﬀ between eﬃciency and accuracy, but neither of them is able to
achieve both goals at the same time. With the aim of achieving both eﬃciency and accuracy, a hybrid modelling
method is proposed in this paper for crowd simulation. This paper illustrates how the two types of models co-exist in
a single simulation and work collaboratively. A case study for this method is also conducted, the simulation result of
which shows that the proposed method can not only beneﬁt from the macroscopic model by improving the simulation
eﬃciency, but also obtain a ﬁne-grained simulation result by adopting the microscopic model.

1. Introduction
Crowd simulation has become an eﬃcient tool to study the behavior and movement pattern of crowd in real life.
Currently, macroscopic and microscopic methods are the two main modelling methods for crowd simulation. The
macroscopic method (e.g., methods used in [1, 2]) focuses on the movement features of the whole crowd; whereas
microscopic models, such as the methods used in [3], emphasize the issues of individual characteristics, including
pedestrian’s psychological and social behaviours, communication among pedestrians, and individual decision making
processes. With the ability to describe individual aspects, microscopic models can generate a ﬁne-grain simulation in
more detail than the macroscopic method. However, this is achieved at the cost of higher computation complexity. In
contrast, macroscopic models oﬀer a higher execution eﬃciency than microscopic models due to its lack of concerns of
individual issues, however, which in turn makes the macroscopic models unable to generate a precise simulation result
at individual level. Moreover, macroscopic models cannot cover all the characteristics of crowd behaviour, which
further limits its applicability. For example, a typical macroscopic model cannot be easily applied to heterogeneous
crowd. In contrast, microscopic models, simulating each individual using an agent, is highly ﬂexible and can be used
in the simulation of crowd in dynamic environments.

Existing work has attempted to combine the diﬀerent models together, with the aim of obtaining both execution
eﬃciency from macroscopic model and the ﬁne-grain simulation result from microscopic model. One typical method
(used in [4]) is the layered approach where diﬀerent layers adopt diﬀerent models. For example, in [5] the macroscopic model is used at the crowd level to generate simple rules to govern the movement of individuals; while the
microscopic model generates the collision avoidance for each individual in the crowd. These methods can decrease
the time necessary for model execution to some extent. However, it cannot simulate the scenarios to which the adopted
macroscopic model is not applicable. Unlike the above methods, the multi-resolution method, proposed in [6], incorporates both a complete macroscopic model and a microscopic model and executes them inter-changeably. Such an
approach can solve the applicability problem of macroscopic model. However, the execution eﬃciency is achieved on
the assumption that the crowd movement is mostly stable (or becomes stable eventually).
This paper proposes a hybrid modelling method for crowd simulation, which combines macroscopic and microscopic models in a single simulation. The simulation environment is partitioned in terms of the crowd characteristic.
Each partition is then modelled independently with either a macroscopic or microscopic model. During execution
of the simulation, the two types of models work simultaneously on the corresponding partitions. As the models are
executed independently, mechanisms are required to transfer data at the boundaries between the partitions. Two types
of interaction mechanisms, i.e., aggregation and disaggregation are deﬁned in this paper. The operation of aggregation
collects density and velocity information from the simulation result of the agent-based model and then injects them
into the macroscopic model as the initial conditions. The operation of disaggregation generates agents at the partition
boundary, which is based on the information of crowd density and velocity obtained from the macroscopic model at
the boundary. The proposed method makes it possible for macroscopic and microscopic models to work concurrently
and hence exploit the advantages from both models. In addition, the method can also avoid the applicability limitation
of the macroscopic model, since it can simulate those scenarios where the macroscopic model would otherwise not
be applicable by adopting the microscopic model. A case study of the proposed hybrid modelling is conducted, the
result of which shows that the proposed method can beneﬁt not only from the macroscopic model by improving the
execution eﬃciency, but also from the microscopic model in terms of simulation accuracy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the existing related work is introduced in Section 2. An overview of
the hybrid modelling of crowd simulation is introduced in Section 3. The interactions between the diﬀerent models are
deﬁned in Section 4. A case study of the hybrid modelling is conducted in Section 5. The paper is ﬁnally concluded
in Section 6.
2. Related Work
One of the typical methods to model and simulate large scale human crowds is agent-based method (a kind
of microscopic method), in which each person in the crowd is simulated individually. This is primarily because
pedestrians have distinct characteristics and make decisions depending on personal goals. For example, [3] employed
a multi-agent based framework to demonstrate emergent human social behaviors, for instance, competing, queuing,
and herding. On the other hand, the individual behavior is constrained by the whole movement of the crowd. For
instance, following behavior and queue formation are two typical constrained behaviors in real life. The higher
the pedestrian density is, the more the individual will follow the average movement of the crowd. Regarding this,
macroscopic models, such as those in [1, 2], study the principles of crowd movement and simulate the movement
pattern of the whole crowd instead of simulating each individual in a crowd.
In terms of execution eﬃciency and simulation accuracy, the two diﬀerent kinds of models are complementary.
Aimed at obtaining a high execution eﬃciency as well as a ﬁne-grain simulation result, there are some existing pieces
of work that attempt to combine the two diﬀerent models together. Methods used in [4] adopt part of modules from
both the macroscopic and microscopic model and combine them into a single model. The basic idea is to divide the
model into two layers: a set of governing equations are applied from the macroscopic model at the top layer. This
performs the role of the cognitive module which results in the overall movement pattern of whole crowd. Based on
this result, the movement of each individual is simulated by a simpliﬁed microscopic model at the bottom layer. Since
the method mentioned above still needs to execute the microscopic model for all the individuals in the crowd, the
simulation eﬃciency deﬁnitely decreases as the crowd size increases. In addition, it does not avoid the limitation of
the macroscopic model. If the adopted macroscopic model is not applicable for a speciﬁed crowd, the whole method
will not be applicable.

In contrast to these methods, we have previously proposed a multi-resolution modelling [6] approach, which attempts to combine both macroscopic and microscopic models. The approach of this method is to make the two models
work inter-changeable: the macroscopic model governs the simulation when the crowd movement is stabilized; if there
is an event which makes the crowd movement unstable, the simulator will switch to microscopic mode and choose the
microscopic model to simulate the crowd movement. The simulation will change back to the macroscopic mode when
the crowd movement becomes stable again. This method is suitable for simulating crowds whose movement remains
mostly stable. It can also avoid the limitation of the macroscopic model, because the part of environment, for which
macroscopic model is not applicable, can be simulated by the microscopic model.
3. Overview of Hybrid Modelling
The basic idea of hybrid modelling is to apply both microscopic and macroscopic models in diﬀerent areas of the
simulation environment and execute them simultaneously. In order to implement this, the simulation environment is
divided into exclusive partitions, in terms of the crowd composition. Due to the limited applicability of the macroscopic model, it is only applied to those partitions within which only homogeneous crowd exists. The agent-based
model is then applied to other partitions, where heterogeneous crowd exists. An illustration of the hybrid modelling
deployment is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Deployment Example of Hybrid Modelling Method

The hybrid modelling of crowd simulation is continuously executed in a time-stepped manner. For each simulation
step, the process of the hybrid modelling execution can be divided into two stages: 1) receiving and handling the initial
conditions, and 2) the model execution. At the beginning of a simulation step the models need a set of initial conditions
as input parameters. After the preparation of the initial conditions, the models are executed in parallel until the end
of the current simulation step. With a set of given initial conditions for a simulation step, the crowd can be simulated
independently without any communication between diﬀerent partitions.
The functionality of the ﬁrst stage of the hybrid modelling execution, i.e., receiving and handling initial conditions,
is to prepare the necessary information for the current simulation step. For example, a typical macroscopic model
needs the crowd density and crowd velocity on every location of the simulated environment. This information can
be generated from the model’s previous time step in the area that is not neighbouring other partitions. The initial
conditions at the boundary areas, however, depend not only on the simulation result of last simulation step, but also
on the simulation result from the neighboring partitions at last simulation step. Therefore an interaction mechanism
is necessary to exchange the crowd/agent information with the neighbouring partitions. The details of the interaction
between two neighboured partitions will be discussed in the next section.
4. Interactions
As mentioned in Section 3, agent/crowd may be transferred between the boundary of two partitions. Therefore,
an interaction mechanism is needed to help partitions migrate those agents (or crowd) from one partition to the other.

The simulation state and result are quite diﬀerent for both models. Since the microscopic model focuses on the
crowd at the individual level and simulates the behavior and movement of each individual in crowd, its state can
be expressed by the position and velocity of each agent in the crowd. The macroscopic model state is expressed as
the crowd density and velocity at speciﬁed locations over the environment. If two neighboring partitions adopt the
same type of simulation model, the interaction mechanism will directly inject the simulation result from one model
into the other one. On the other hand, if the types of the two neighbouring models are diﬀerent, the interaction
mechanism ﬁrst needs to convert the simulation result into the correct format. This conversion is done through two
interaction operations, i.e., aggregation and disaggregation. The operation of aggregation collects density and velocity
information from the simulation result of the microscopic model at the boundary areas. Conversely, the operation of
disaggregation generates agents at the boundary areas based on the information of crowd density and velocity taken
from the macroscopic model. Detailed design issues of the two interaction operation are discussed below.
4.1. Aggregation
The execution of aggregation will be triggered if there are agents that cross the boundary from the partition
simulated by microscopic model to the one by macroscopic model. The aggregation process converts the simulation
result from the microscopic model to the format of macroscopic model. Since only simulation result at the boundary
area of the two neighboring partitions needs to be exchanged between the two models, the operation of aggregation
only utilizes the simulation result of the microscopic model at the boundary areas.
A typical numerical solution to a macroscopic model needs to divide the environment into ﬁnite cells and obtains
a result for each cell, which can be considered as the average result for every point inside the cell. In order to generate
the same result format from the partition simulated by the microscopic model, the environment near the boundary area
at the microscopic model side is also divided into cells (of the same size). An illustration of this process is shown in
Figure 2, where the cells at the right side of the boundary are speciﬁed by the numerical solution of the macroscopic
model, and the cells at the left side of the boundary are deﬁned according to the cell size used in the macroscopic
model. Each boundary cell in the macroscopic partition has a counterpart located at the other side of the boundary,
simulated by the microscopic model.

Figure 2: Cell Deﬁnition in Microscopic Model for Aggregation Operation

At the beginning of each simulation time step, the aggregation operation will generate the crowd density and
velocity in each cell deﬁned in the partition simulated by the microscopic model. The aggregation operation counts
the number of individuals inside the cell and then calculates the average density for the cell. As for the crowd velocity
for each cell, the operation of aggregation gets the velocities of all the agents inside the cell and calculates the average
velocity. Subsequently, the operation of aggregation will inject this information into the neighbouring macroscopic
model as the initial conditions.
4.2. Disaggregation
The functionality of disaggregation is to convert and transfer the simulation result from the format of the macroscopic model into the correct format for the microscopic model. If there exists crowd ﬂow leaving from the partition
simulated by macroscopic model and entering into the one simulated by microscopic model, the disaggregation will
be executed at the boundary of these two partitions. Since the microscopic model needs the location and velocity information for each agent, the operation of disaggregation generates new individuals for the microscopic model based
on the crowd density and velocity from the macroscopic model.

Figure 3: Environment Description

In order to generate the new agents for the microscopic model, the area near the boundary in the microscopic partition still must be divided into cells. This is achieved in an equivalent way to the aggregation operation (illustrated in
Figure 2). Hence, each cell at the boundary in the partition simulated by macroscopic model will have a corresponding
counterpart at the other side of the boundary.
At the beginning of each simulation time step, the operation of disaggregation ﬁrst fetches the crowd density and
velocity from the cells bordering the boundary in the macroscopic model. The method assumes the boundary cells in
the microscopic partition share the same crowd characteristics (i.e., crowd density and velocity) as their corresponding
cells in the macroscopic partition. Using this information the method generates new agents for the corresponding
cells in the microscopic model. The crowd density and cell area determine the number of individuals inside the cell;
the velocities of the individuals is directly adopted as the crowd velocity for the cell; ﬁnally, these individuals are
uniformly distributed in the cell.
5. Case Study
An agent-based model, which is proposed in [7] with the focus being collision-free motion, is adopted as the
microscopic model for our case study. The continuum model, proposed in [2], is adopted as the macroscopic model.
Based on this continuum model, [8] further proposed a numerical solution to the continuum model, which is also
adopted as the solution method for our hybrid model.
5.1. Scenario Description
The scenario adopted for the case study is to simulate agents moving through a corridor. Figure 3 shows the
description of the environment. We divide the environment into three sections of diﬀerent width; an entrance and exit
are located at the left and right side of the environment respectively.
Each agent, who comes from the entrance (locating at the left side of Area1) and leaves the environment through
the exit (locating at the right side of Area3), will pass through a narrow corridor (Area2 in the middle of the environment). In addition, the movements of all the agents are constrained by the walls located at the top and bottom
area of the environment. In this case study, we conducted three experiments by adopting the agent-based, continuum
and hybrid modelling to simulate how agent goes through the speciﬁed environment, separately. For all the three
experiments, the ﬂow rate of agent coming into the environment from the entrance is ﬁxed and set to 1/(m ∗ s).
The executions of the continuum and agent-based model are straightforward by directly applying these models
into the adopted scenario. As for the hybrid modelling, we adopt the agent-based model in Area1 and Area3, while
the continuum model is applied in Area2. In addition, since the agent’s movement is unidirectional, the interactions
between the diﬀerent models simpliﬁes to: the operation of aggregation between Area1 and Area2 and disaggregation
between Area2 and Area3. In general, where bidirectional ﬂow may be present, both operations may be necessary at
a given boundary.

Figure 4: Simulation Result by Agent-Based Model

5.2. Simulation Result Comparison
As claimed in [9], the shadow eﬀect should appear for crowd passing through such an environment. It refers to
the phenomenon that the pedestrian density in the areas, which is after the narrow corridor and near the edge of the
environment, will be kept nearly zero. As for the environment in our case study, there should be few agents near
the top and bottom areas in Area3, after the agents pass through Area2. This phenomenon can be veriﬁed by the
simulation result of the experiment adopting the agent-based model, which is shown in Figure 4.
However, if we use the continuum model to simulate the crowd, this eﬀect does not appear (the simulation results
are shown in Figure 5). This is because the continuum model considers all the pedestrians in the crowd as homogeneous, all of which attempt to ﬁnd and move into lower density areas. As a result, the crowd will ﬁll every location of
the environment, including Area3 where the shadow eﬀect is supposed to appear.
We then use the proposed hybrid modelling to simulate agents movement in the given scenario. We do this by
adopting the agent-based model in Area1 and Area3, and by applying the continuum model for the crowd in Area2.
The simulation result is shown in Figure 6, where the dots in Area1 and Area3 represent the locations of agents in the
simulation, and the color in Area2 means the crowd density in the corresponding location. It shows that there are few
agents near the top and the bottom of Area3, which is exactly what shadow eﬀect refers to.
In summary, both the hybrid model and the agent-based model can generate similar shadow eﬀect. However, this
eﬀect does not appear in the simulation result by the continuum model. This indicates that the adopted continuum
model, ignoring some individual characteristics of the crowd, is unable to recreate certain phenomena. On the contrary,
the hybrid modelling, combining the two models together, is able to produce a simulation result similar to the agentbased model. This veriﬁes that the hybrid modelling can beneﬁt from the agent-based model, in terms of accuracy of
simulation result.
5.3. Performance Comparison
As discussed in Section 1, the hybrid modelling can also beneﬁt from the macroscopic model, in terms of simulation eﬃciency. The simulation costs for the experiments by the three models are studied in this subsection, and the

Figure 7: Performance Comparison Amongst Agent-Based Model, Continuum Model and Hybrid Modelling

cost is evaluated by elapsed time per simulation step. The simulation cost is plotted in Figure 7. This compares the
agent-based model, the continuum model and hybrid model in same corridor scenario.
At the beginning of the simulation (before the 30th simulation time step), the agent-based model is the most
eﬃcient in terms of execution amongst all the three models. At this phase, there are very few agents in the environment
and these agents are contained within Area1. The crowd density of Area2 and Area3 is zero. In contrast, both the
hybrid model and the continuum model must continually execute for Areas2, even in case of zero density in this area.
This means both the hybrid and continuum model initially have a higher execution cost than the agent-based model.
The hybrid modelling at this stage executes more eﬃciently than the continuum model, the reason for which lies in
the fact that the area handled by the continuum model is smaller in the hybrid model.
As simulation time elapses and more agents come into the environment, the three models show diﬀerent simulation
costs. Since the numerical solution of the continuum model does not depend on the crowd size but rather on the
environment size, the simulation cost in the continuum model experiment remains constant (as expected). This is
veriﬁed by the performance result of the continuum model in this case study, where its simulation cost for each
time step is almost constant throughout the whole simulation, with an average value of 230ms. It is also the most
eﬃcient simulation amongst the three models, after the simulation step of 30 (i.e., once the number of agents in the
environment reaches a certain level).
Between the 40th and 90th simulation time step, the number of agents in Area1 stabilizes and agents begin to
come into Area2, while the number of agents in Area3 still keeps zero. The agent-based model has a nearly linear
increase in simulation cost. This is because the number of agents increases at a constant incoming rate while no agent
leaves the environment. However, the simulation cost of the hybrid modelling for the same period remains almost
constant. At this period, the cost in the experiment adopting the hybrid model is composed by two parts, the cost by
the agent-based model in Area1, and the cost by the continuum model in Area2. No cost is associated with Area3,
since there are no agents there. The cost of the continuum model in Area2 should be constant, since it is not aﬀected
by the crowd size. The cost of the agent-based model in Area1 should not change signiﬁcantly, because after the
simulation step 40 the number of agents entering Area1 is more or less the same as the number leaving.
After the 90th simulation time step, agents begin to enter Area3. Since the number of agents inside the whole
environment is still increasing, the simulation cost of the agent-based model continues to rise. As for the cost of
hybrid modelling, rather than remaining constant, the cost also begins to increase. This is due to more agents now
entering Area3.
Finally, after the ﬁrst agent leaves the environment (after the 140th simulation step), the number of agents simulated in both the hybrid and the agent-based model stops increasing, as the number of agents entering and leaving the
whole environment becomes more or less the same. As a result, the cost of both models does not change much. Some
cost variations can still be observed during this stage. This is due to the number of agents leaving the environment
being not strictly constant, as the agent density is not uniform throughout the environment.
Our simulation results thus have shown that the hybrid modelling can also beneﬁts from the continuum model by
improving overall simulation eﬃciency.

6. Conclusions and Future Work
Hybrid modelling for crowd simulation is proposed in this paper, aiming to exploit advantages from both macroscopic and microscopic models. The two types of models work collaboratively in a single simulation, and are executed
over diﬀerent mutually exclusive partitions. The execution of these models are independent from one another during
each simulation step. However, it is possible for the crowd to move from one partition to another, and interactions are
used for models to exchange this information. In this paper, two types of interactions are deﬁned, i.e., aggregation and
disaggregation, which helps models to communicate at a partition boundary. A case study of the hybrid modelling
shows that it not only oﬀers more eﬃcient execution than the microscopic model, but also improves the simulation
quality in comparison with the macroscopic model.
In this paper we have shown that combined hybrid modelling can oﬀer signiﬁcant advantages over traditional
approaches to crowd simulation. This is achieved through exchanging simulation state at boundary cells between
diﬀerent models. However, in the current implementation, the exchange of state information is unidirectional. For
example, if we consider the case study and examine the boundary from the continuum model to the agent model
(Area2 to Area3), the agent model does not aﬀect the calculation of the continuum model in this case. In our case
study, only the continuum model provides information for seeding new agents in the microscopic model. For more
correct results, there should be an overlapping set of cells (as in overlapping domain decomposition [10]) so that
the density of agents (in the microscopic model) should also deﬁne an initial boundary condition for the continuum
model. In future work we plan to investigate the overlapping boundary for both models, which hopefully helps to
further improve the simulation accuracy.
