Abstract
Small and middle businesses (SMBs) are playing an increasingly important role, but their decision making process mostly relies
on skilled employees which are usually inadequate. Based on information systems, data mining and Extension Theory (Extenics),
we present a knowledge cultivating method and design a knowledge management platform for improve decision making quality.
Through divergence analysis, correlation analysis, and implication analysis, a flow chart of knowledge cultivating algorithm has
been designed, and an intelligent knowledge management platform has been developed. By collecting knowledge or information
from conditions and the goal, we choose several knowledge as seed, then distribute it to all the department leaders, let them input
relative knowledge including data mining knowledge to the platform. The platform then connects them into a knowledge tree
with Human-Computer Interaction and enterprise ontology techniques intelligently. From the knowledge tree, we can find the
problem solving map and guide the managers in SBMs to take actions by scanning all possible paths. The application in a food
company proved its practicality value.

1. Introduction
Small& middle businesses (SMBs) are playing more and more important role in economy. One of the SMBs’
problems is that there are not enough wise and skilled employees to make right decisions when the problem occurs
[1]. Most decisions are made subjectively by the boss, without considering other people’s suggestions or some latent
factors. The boss needs decision support urgently. Especially in the context of the financial crisis, the requirements
of business-decision support system have been increasing. Several knowledge management platforms had been
designed to improve the decision level [2-4]. However, the knowledge accumulating needs practice and time, some
bosses can’t keep waiting. The World Wide Web, information systems and other data set have constructed a huge
information source for decision making, Information technology promoted the decision making in three major
directions: “decision support, multiple criteria decision making, and data mining and risk analysis” [5]. Some

systems support decision makers by multicriteria decision anglicizing [6] or various types of classifiers such as
support vector machines (SVM), C4.5 algorithm, and K-nearest-neighbor algorithm [7]. To solve the problems of
fuzzy multi-attribute group decision making, paper [8] presented a fuzzy dominance method for ranking trapezoidal
fuzzy numbers based on the credibility theory and gray relative degree. With information be exchanged freely
among several modules, paper [9] integrated macroeconomic early warning theories and a knowledge base to policy
making process: monitoring, forecasting, and policy simulation, it can support the economic early warning and
policy making process. All above methods or models can improve decision making intelligently to a certain extent,
but they are not easy to be applied in SMBs, because there are usually few support environments and skilled
employees.
Management information systems have been utilized in some SMBs, from which data mining, web mining or text
mining [10-11] can discover knowledge from web pages or database. But there are also no sufficient skilled persons
to handle them in SMBs. Even they can afford the project fee by cooperating with professional company, they
usually can’t get practical knowledge in a short time, the engineers need time to obtain the experience of the related
fields and clean the data systematically [12]. So the result of input-output is usually not satisfied. Even the
knowledge is discovered from data, this kind of new knowledge is huge and rough, not all the knowledge is useful in
applications. For example, in a VIP email accounts analysis project, 420 rules were mined out from a data set of
16,496 records and 231 attributes by See 5 software, each rule is a kind of knowledge but only several rules are
useful. The knowledge from data mining goes far beyond the traditional knowledge, so they can not be used
efficiently.
Realizing the importance of post-processing on data mining results, some scholars had tried to make management
of this kind of knowledge intelligently [13-15], and further more presented lots of frameworks for intelligent
knowledge management [16-18]. But most of the researches have not yet been applied into practical use in SMBs.
Computer assistance on solving problems is in many ways, as for SBMs, the most important thing is to provide clear
and simple instructions to the decision makers [19]. Only a simple and practical way can help the boss to achieve
wise decisions, which is in great demand.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a knowledge cultivating method for SBMs to optimize the process of
decision making. By reporting the problem and collecting knowledge step by step, the knowledge accumulated and
form a knowledge tree, from it we can find the relations between the information and knowledge, and then add
human domain knowledge to the tree, the tree is growing and finally covers the larger area and solves the problem.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the knowledge seeding technologies. Section 3
describes the algorithm and the process of knowledge cultivating. Section 4 presents a case study in a food company.
Section 5 concludes the paper with future research directions.
2. Knowledge Seeding Technologies
Every enterprise has data, information or knowledge, special knowledge plays an important role in decision
making process. But most SMBs just own them, instead of share it, update it and make benefit from it. The
knowledge they owned usually is partial and local, only reflects a certain side of business. While intelligent decision
making process must collect as much as knowledge and integrate it from different views to reach a complete
understanding of the problem. So the first step to improve the decision level in SMBs is to obtain as much as
knowledge and seed it for later use. Extenics [20] gives a way to collect information and knowledge systemically
and gives series methods to utilize them. Meanwhile data mining gives a way to discover novel knowledge [11].
These two technologies can combine and will have a good fruit for decision support.
2.1. Extension Theory-- Extenics
Extenics is constituted of Element theory, extension methodology and extension engineering. It is a
new discipline for dealing with contradiction problems with formulizing models [20]. To make wise
decisions, we must consider the objects, the characteristics and the measure together. A matter has many
characteristics. From the view point of material nature, every matter is the entity of the imaginary part and the real
part. Similarly, each element has four extensibilities: the divergent nature, the conjugate nature, the correlative
nature and the implicative nature. As to the conjugate nature, there are four pairs of conjugate parts including the

X. Li et al. / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 2479–2488

Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000–000

2481

real part (the entity of a matter’s existence) and the imaginary part (the sprit of the element, such as brand of a
product), the soft part (relation structure between parts of a system) and the hard part (each part in a system), the
latent part (unnoticeable element or forthcoming change) and the apparent part (noticeable element), and the
negative part (the part creating positive value to the goal) and the positive part (the part creating negative value to
the goal). This gives a testing way to check whether we own systematic knowledge for intelligent decision making.
A matter can be expressed as an ordered triad
R = (N, c, v)

(1)

R is the matter-element, N represents the matter , c is the characteristics , and v is the measure about the
characteristics c .
Moreover, Extenics establishes matter-element R = (N, c, v), affair-element I = (d, b, u ) and relation-element
Q = (s, a, w) (each has attributes or characteristics and their measure) to describe matter affair and relation.
Matter-element, affair-element and relation-element are collectively called basic element. A matter has many
characteristic-elements, which can be described by n-dimensional matter-elements.

All information and knowledge related to the goals and conditions in decision making can be expressed as
matter-elements. Extenics also presented transformation methods. By certain transformation, one thing that
doesn't have property P can be turned into another thing that has the property P. Extension set can
describe this kind of transformation quantitatively. So the extension field can be recognized as a set of
things that doesn't have the property P but can be changed into those with the property P [21]. Up to now
a series of particular extension methods have been developed and applied in various fields [20].
2.2. Data mining technology
Data mining discovers knowledge and rules from large numbers of data. They are connotative, unknown, which
are likely to be interested, and to have latency values for decision-making [10-11]. Today data mining has been
widely accepted. But for SBMs, to organize a data mining project is not easy. Data mining process can be divided
into six phases [22]: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and
deployment. These phases can help SBMs understand the data mining process and provide a road map to follow
while planning and carrying out a data mining project. But in SBMs, data quality is low, data cleaning often cost
much time [12]. In order to collect enough information for decision making intelligently, we must have enough
source with good quality, and then have tools and methods to extract information or knowledge from them.
There are many data sources in the information age. Besides information systems, The World Wide Web has also
become a common and huge information source. Billions of pages are publicly available and it is still growing
dramatically every day. Data mining is a useful tool for mining constriction knowledge from data base, text files and
the web. Combining Extenics with data mining, a new methodology called Extension data mining (EDM) [23] has
been build up. The main task of EDM is to acquire the transformation knowledge to help for better decisions. It
takes advantage of extension methods and data mining technology, explores to acquire the knowledge based on
extension transformations.
Web mining and text mining can discover lots of knowledge from huge amounts of web pages, including web
documents, hyperlinks between documents, usage logs of web sites, and local text files, public database etc [10].
Meanwhile EDM can acquire extensible classification knowledge, conductive knowledge. Such kinds of data,
information and knowledge gathering together, we have to do deep research on how to select proper knowledge for
decision making from them.

2.3. Knowledge Seeding method
The mean purpose of knowledge management and data mining is to aid people make wise decisions and finally
solve problems. Many problems are in latent status or just show its surface, so find the problem is the beginning.
Usually bosses or higher leader can find some problems in the company, data mining or information analysis can
help department leaders find the same problems too. All problems can be expressed as information, and among them
there must exists certain knowledge as the key to the problem solving.
The process to write the relative knowledge to the problems is called knowledge seeding. The primary relative
knowledge is called seed knowledge. The process to find the key knowledge from seed knowledge is called
knowledge cultivating.
Finding seed knowledge start from the problem P = G ∗ L , when the condition L can not enable the goal G to
come true, then P is called the incompatibility problem [21], G and L can be expressed with basic-elements, the
operational formulas of basic-elements or complex-elements. Accordingly, seed knowledge can be classified into
two types: one is relative to conditions L; one is relative to the goal G.
G and L can be expressed with basic-elements, the operational formulas of basic-elements or complex-elements.
Suppose c01㧘c02㧘…㧘c0m are evaluating characteristics of P, P 0= g0∗ l 0 is the core problem of P [21], where

Seed knowledge is most relative to the core problem P 0. According to Extenics, there are three main methods to
find seed knowledge:
1. Divergence analysis - based on divergent of base element.
R = ( N , c, v ) − |{( N , c1 , v1 ), ( N , c2 , v2 )..., ( N , cn , vn )}

(5)

-| represents divergent directions.
2. Correlation analysis - based on the relevance of base element.
If c0(B2)=f [c0(B1)]ˈand c0(B1)=f -1 [c0(B2)]ˈthen we named B1 and B2 is relative based on attribute c0, noted as
B1~ B2.
3. Implication analysis - based on implitility of base element.
A implies B means that "If A, then B", written as
AB

(6)

2483

The above relation between A and B is called the implication relation, which can exist among matters,
characteristics, measure, characteristic-elements and matter-elements. The elements B1, B2, …, Bn and the
implication relation among them constitute an implication system B.
Data mining also can discover novel knowledge from data base as seed knowledge. Knowledge discovered from
data may take many forms, such as equations, contingency tables, taxonomies, decision trees, rules, graphs, concepts,
exceptions from patterns, and many others. Knowledge entity and its meta-data can be represented by matterelement too. in general, the knowledge seeding method is shown in Fig 1.

3. Knowledge cultivating Method and its Process
From seed knowledge to the solution is a long way. Most of times, we can not find the solution mainly rely on
employee’s experience, that’s why problems everywhere. The boss is too tired to solve all problems, so he organizes
his/her subordinates to make decisions together. Multi-person decision making process involve the preferences of
some experts about a set of alternatives in order to find the best one. However, sometimes experts might not possess
a precise or sufficient level of knowledge and as a consequence that expert might not obtain all the information that
is required. Studied on incomplete information situations, paper [24] designed several procedures that can compute
the missing information of a preference relation and analyzed several strategies to deal with these situations.
Essentially, what most scholars did is to complement the knowledge what decision making need.
According to a detailed information collecting list [25], we can complement comprehensive information and
knowledge for intelligent decision making. With the information cube [25], we can collect the integrated
information from the web or other data sources systematically. Then we can take advantage of extension method to
let seed knowledge grow up according to the extensibility of basic-element. These will greatly improve the
intelligence level of decision making in SMBs.
3.1. Key Processes for Knowledge cultivating
There are as many methods for knowledge cultivating as for data mining. The purpose of decision making is to
find the way to the goal we expect. And the way relies on information and knowledge we have owned. The problem
is that we sometimes can’t tell the way when we are faced with so much information and knowledge. So the most
practical method of knowledge cultivating is to find the relations between them and form knowledge net.
There are three ways to solve an incompatibility problem: (1) the goal doesn’t be changed, a contradiction

2484

X. Li et al. / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 2479–2488

Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000–000

problem can be solved through changing its conditions; (2) the conditions don’t be changed, a contradiction problem
can be solved through changing its goal; (3) the contradiction problem can be solved through changing both its goal
and conditions at the same time [20]. Whatever the way we choose, we can establish an extension set using the
measure as quantity fields. And then we can let knowledge grow by divergence analysis and extension
transformations. When the knowledge tree grows big enough, some ones can change an incompatibility problem
into compatibility one.
Based on the above analysis, we designed a framework of Extension theory based knowledge cultivating process
as in Fig 2. The process of cultivating seed knowledge to knowledge tree has six main steps by man-computer
cooperative methods.

Fig. 2.knowledge cultivating methods and its process

Step 1, Distribute business problems and their condition-goal information with knowledge seed to all
departments of the company on a sharing platform. The platform can be web site or management system or
other BBS et al.
Step 2, Add information or knowledge related to the problems to the above platform. The information or
knowledge should cover the real part and the imaginary part, the soft part and the hard part, the latent part and the
apparent part, and the negative part and the positive part. In addition, correlation analysis and implication analysis
are used to find the cause, the relation net et al. These will make sure that the problem is been considered
systematically.
Step 3, Connect information or knowledge by element name or it characters and measure. Clip redundant
information or knowledge. A knowledge clustering will appear. This step can be implemented by software,
which needs support of ontology base.
Step 4, Evaluate the clustered knowledge and select the feasible ones to make transformations. The
transformations methods include replacement Tr, decomposition Td, increasing or decreasing Tl , and expansion or
contraction Te, which are four basic transformations of matter-elements [20].
Step 5, Through above steps, we have formed a lot of knowledge trees, add human experience knowledge to
connect them to be a whole knowledge tree.
Step 6, Judge if the tree can help make decisions and solve the problem. If not, we can collect much more
information from it in next loop. If yes, store the main path into solution base and share it to managers.
If a transformation TW (or TK or Tl ) can not solve an incompatibility problem, we can consider conductive

2485

X. Li et al. / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 2479–2488

Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000–000

transformations of these transformations.
3.2. Knowledge tree and its implementation
Though the above process, the SBMs will calculate a lot of knowledge on some problems, so a software platform
is necessary to manage them efficiently. So we designed a structure to store knowledge tree and form an enterprise
ontology base [26]. Then we designed the data base with its tables, proposed an algorithm as showing in Fig 3.
In the algorithm, we first locating the problem expressed with base element, then collect information and
knowledge especially from data mining. We select knowledge as seed, cultivate it based on ontology or basic
element base. Then we judge if the knowledge tree grows to meet the goal, if not, maybe add more experience
knowledge by human-computer interaction. Loop until meet the need of decision makers.
Finally a management system is developed to support knowledge seeding and cultivating process. Through the
platform we can get a map of how to achieve goal by a certain knowledge tree. The tree is shown in Fig 4 as follows:

Fig.4. Knowledge cultivating from a knowledge tree

The knowledge tree is consisted of kinds of information and knowledge comes from many departments or even
from data mining. Every one’s experience is limited, by integrating many employees knowledge by information
technology, it is possible for ordinary people make right decisions and solve the problems formerly only the boss
can do. From the tree, we can also understand the path from conditions to the goal, and find the answer like which
knowledge is the key factor or which one is the essential reason of the problem. With such knowledge accumulated
to an extent, the decision level in SMBs will arise day by day.
The detailed description is shown in the following case in section 4.

A food company in north China produced a new kind of drinks in almond like coffee. The distribution of its
orders is very uneven; generally, the average order cycle is 7 to 27 days. Besides, through data mining, we found
that 95% orders are more than 420 boxes. Almost every order requires the products made in 7 days and delivered
hopefully within 4-6 days.
The maximum safety stock of semi-finished products in its workshop is only for 120 boxes and the products can
be produced 20 boxes per day. Even the two lines in factory can run all the time, only made 140 boxes of products
in 7 days, how can we arrange production lines to meet the order needs? If we install one more produce line, and
hire more employees, most of time the resource is in idle. The profit therefore is decreased or even loss. Their goal
is that the factory can produce evenly, but the store can meet the order needs without build new lines or hire more
people.
After the seed knowledge is put forward, the company made knowledge cultivating as following:

Fig 5 the main window of knowledge cultivating software platform

(1). Implication analysis: Why is the general weight of every order about 420 boxes? Why are they required
newly produced products in the last week and delivered so quickly within 4-6 days?
(2). The sales department offered a sales policy that the minimum order of 200 boxes every time is required. So
the order of less than 200 boxes is forbidden. Another policy they added is that the dealer can enjoy 10% discount if
an order with more than 400 boxes, and if an order is more than or equal to 600 boxes, the dealer can enjoy 15%
discount. Generally there are 2 to 3 dealers for each sales region and in order to get price concessions they prefer
order 400 boxes of products.
(3). The marketing department informed that the new sales region needs to distribute products and the random of
these new shops’ orders is large, so it is difficult to predict the date of orders in the expansion period.
(4). Why did the products require to be produced in the last week and delivered hopefully within 3 days? The
logistics department reflected that dealers often need 5 to 6 months to sell out 400 boxes of products, and the shelf
life is 6 months and consumers like to buy the products of the latest production date, so if the products ordered
produced in 3 weeks, there is high probability that expired products are scrapped. As a result, dealers always try to
get products produced recently.
(5). The dealers said if new products are delivered while the old ones are not sold out, it will be more difficult for
the old ones to be sold because consumers always choose the new, so dealers always order when it’s almost out of
stock. Besides, if the products can’t be delivered during seven days, there may be lack of products. Taking into
account 3 days’ transport time and 2 days’ insurance period, there are only 4 days for delivery, which is the reason
why dealers attach importance to delivery time.

By transform production conditions, the boss think it’s too low that daily produce capacity of the equipment is
only 20 boxes per day. He asked the workshop director to improve produce capacity. By changing the combination
of team members, daily capacity can increase to 23 boxes per day without additional equipment and personnel. In
accordance with the knowledge cultivating, they take transformations as following:
Firstly, decompose the sales policy: from “if an order is more than 400 boxes, the dealer can enjoy 10% discount”
to “if the orders are sum up to 400 boxes in half a year, the dealer can enjoy 90% discount” and the minimum
quantity of each order changes from 200 boxes to 10 boxes.
Secondly, they cooperate with many small logistics, and can transport 10 boxes of products to the dealer in 2 days.
The delivery date and the demands of production date reduce accordingly. The main window of knowledge
cultivating system is shown in Fig 5.
After the extension transformation above, the problem changes: Small orders arrive continuously, the enterprises’
production capacity is balanced, the expired loss of products in the shop drops to the minimum. Customer
satisfaction increases and competitiveness to develop new markets improves.
The knowledge-cultivating algorithm works on the existing conditions to find optimal solution. In this process,
the condition transformation may have to be cycled several times and each time the conditions are re-transformed.
The condition transformation includes implication analysis, interpersonal communication, negotiation et al. We have
to analysis results, discuss and analyze the reasons. Therefore, it is a systematic algorithm for human-computer
interaction in SMBs, which integrate human system and software algorithms, so that humans can get transformation
methods with the help of extension methods to achieve a wiser decision-making level.
5. Conclusions and Future Study Directions
In the era of knowledge economy, information and knowledge has become an important resource. Knowledge
discovered from data mining can support SMBs to improve decision-making level by our knowledge cultivating
method. The method integrates Extenics, data mining and knowledge management, and can develop a decision
support system platform. By collecting knowledge or information from conditions and the goal among all
departments in SBMs, this platform can share knowledge from every employee in varies forms. Knowledge or
information related to the conditions or goals of the problem can find relations by human-computer interaction
method. Divergence analysis, correlation analysis and implication analysis have been used in the platform and
proved useful to extend knowledge reference range. Then it forms the knowledge tree, in which the problem-solving
map can guide the managers to take actions by scanning all possible paths. A simple intelligent knowledge
management platform can support decision-making process efficently in SMBs.
But the algorithm we used in the paper is relatively simple, the knowledge mapping process need to be improved
more intelligent so as to remind what kind of information should be supplied. On the other hand, knowledge and
information can even reasoning and produce new knowledge. How to update ontology automatically and simulate
the knowledge cultivating process by intelligent agent is the next research work. Moreover, Fuzzy set, complexity
Science and social agent technology will be utilized to improve the platform.
