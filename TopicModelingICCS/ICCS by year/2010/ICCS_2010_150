Abstract
We extend an existing self-adaptive goal-oriented hp-adaptive Finite Element (FE) strategy to the case of multiple
goals. The main idea of this extension is to design a new “quantity of interest” based on the solution of the direct
problem and the given multiple goals. We describe an eﬃcient implementation of the multigoal adaptive strategy, and
we illustrate its performance with numerical results based on a time-harmonic electromagnetics model problem in two
spatial dimensions (2D). Results illustrate the high accuracy and eﬃciency of our self-adaptive reﬁnement strategy.
The computational cost of our proposed multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy is similar to that of a single goal-oriented
adaptive strategy. Multigoal oriented adaptive strategies are needed for a variety of engineering applications, including
multiphysics and inverse problems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions.

1. Introduction
The energy-norm is a quantity of limited relevance for most engineering applications, specially when a particular
objective is pursued, as for example, to simulate the measured electromagnetic ﬁelds at a receiver antenna. Indeed, it is
not uncommon to construct adaptive grids delivering a relative error in the energy-norm below 1% while the solution
at the receiver antennas still contains an error above 1000% (see [1]). Consequently, a self-adaptive strategy is needed
to approximate a special feature of the solution. Reﬁnement strategies of this type are called goal-oriented adaptive
algorithms [2], and are based on minimizing the error of a prescribed quantity of interest mathematically expressed in
terms of a linear functional (see [3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] for details). Goal-oriented adaptive algorithms in context of hp-Finite
Element methods have been recently developed in [8, 9, 10].
While the use of goal-oriented adaptivity has become a major breakthrough in many engineering applications,
there still exist a number of simulation problems in which a ’single’ goal cannot be easily deﬁned. For example, in
the area of geophysical resistivity, a typical measurement acquisition system comprises several receivers located on
the surface of the earth. Clearly, an accurate simulation of the response at one receiver antenna is insuﬃcient for
engineering purposes, and solution at multiple receiver antennas is needed.

In this work, we formulate, implement, and study numerically an extension of the self-adaptive hp goal-oriented
reﬁnement strategy described in [10] to the case of multiple goals. Speciﬁcally, we derive our multigoal-oriented
adaptive algorithm, and we study its performance by simulating the solution over a simpliﬁed model problem that
corresponds to an actual geophysical electromagnetic measurement acquisition system.
There exist two diﬀerent approaches towards multigoal-oriented adaptivity. The ﬁrst one consist of using multiple
grids, one for each goal (see [11]). This approach requires an implementation capable of handling multiple grids,
which may be rather complicated. The second approach consists of constructing a new goal expressed in terms of
a linear functional that properly combines the contribution of all given goals (see [12, 13]). Our work follows this
second approach. In this paper, we construct a diﬀerent and more eﬃcient new goal functional than the one presented
in [13] for the case of Navier-Stokes equations, and we apply it to solve a geophysical electromagnetic application.
The unique feature of our method and main contribution of the paper is that it provides an accurate, eﬃcient, easyto-implement, and rather general algorithm that can be applied to a variety of numerical methods and engineering
applications. In addition, we illustrate the performance of our method by using a rather sophisticated hp-FE reﬁnement
strategy over a problem with multiple receiver antennas.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 depicts the formulation of our multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy.
In Section 3 we discuss the main implementation aspects of our method. Section 4 describes our model problem.
Numerical results based on the model problem are illustrated in Section 5. Section 6 is devoted towards conclusions.
2. Formulation of the Multigoal-Oriented Adaptive Strategy
2.1. Formulation of the Direct Problem
Given a bounded computational domain Ω, we consider the following abstract variational problem:
Find u ∈ u0 + V :

b(u, v) = f (v)

∀v ∈ V = V(Ω),

(1)

where u0 is a lift of the Dirichlet data (for simplicity, we will assume that u0 = 0), V is a Hilbert space, b is a symmetric
sesquilinear form, and f is an antilinear form. We remark that time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations and Helmholtz
equation can be easily represented using the above formulation.
Discretization of space V using hp-FE (where h indicates the element size, and p the polynomial order of approximation) yields to:
b(uhp , vhp ) = f (vhp )
∀vhp ∈ Vhp ,
(2)
Find uhp ∈ Vhp :
where Vhp is a hp-FE subspace of V.

2.2. Formulation of the Adjoint Problems
Our main objective is to eﬃciently approximate quantities of interest li (u), i = 1, ..., M, where li are continuous
linear forms. Thus, we aim at constructing a proper hp-discretization such that li (uhp ) becomes a good approximation
of li (u) ∀i = 1, ..., M. More precisely, we would like all relative errors (in percentage) to be bounded by a prescribed
(given) tolerance error T OL, that is:
max
i

|li (uhp ) − li (u)|
∗ 100 ≤ T OL .
|li (u)|

(3)

For the above condition to make sense, we assume that |li (u)| 0 ∀i.
The left-hand-side of the above inequality delivers a real number that indicates the need (or not) of considering
ﬁner hp-discretizations. However, it provides no indication of how to enrich (reﬁne) the current hp-discretization for
minimizing the error.
In order to determine which elements of the hp-grid should be reﬁned and how, we ﬁrst introduce the so-called adjoint problems. Namely, at the continuous level we have to ﬁnd gi ∈ V such that b(w, gi ) = li (w) ∀w ∈ V, i = 1, ..., M,
where gi (solution of the dual problems) are the so-called inﬂuence functions. Discretization of the above problems
yields to ﬁnd gihp ∈ Vhp such that b(whp , gihp ) = li (whp ) ∀whp ∈ Vhp , i = 1, ..., M.

REMARK: Diﬀerent hp-discretizations can be selected for solving the direct and the adjoint problems. However,
since we employ a direct solver of linear equations and our sesquilinear form is Hermitian, we select the same hpdiscretization for approximating the solutions of the direct and all adjoint problems. This choice of hp-discretization
for the adjoint problems is optimal, since we only need to perform the LU factorization of the stiﬀness matrix once.
Thus, the computational cost of solving all adjoint problems becomes negligible.
2.3. Representation of the Error in the Quantity of Interest
Let ehp = u−uhp denote the discretization error of the direct problem. Then, the error in the i-th quantity of interest
can be represented as li (ehp ) = b(ehp , gi ). We deﬁne the error of the adjoint problem εihp = gi − gihp . By orthogonality
of ehp with respect to Vhp (in b) we have that b(ehp , vhp ) = 0 ∀vhp ∈ Vhp . In particular, b(ehp , gi ) = b(ehp , εihp ). Now,
we bound the error in the i-th quantity of interest by a sum of element contributions:
|li (ehp )| = |b(ehp , εihp )| = |

K

bK (ehp , εihp )| ≤

K

|bK (ehp , εihp )|,

(4)

where bk denotes the contribution from element K to bilinear form b. The above representation formula for the
error in the i-th quantity of interest enables us to design a goal-oriented hp-adaptive reﬁnement strategy intended to
minimize |li (ehp )|. An example of such a goal-oriented hp-adaptive reﬁnement strategy can be found in [10], where we
approximate u by a “ﬁne” grid solution uh/2,p+1 and we employ the so-called “projection based interpolation” operator.
2.4. Multiple Quantities of Interest (M > 1)
While the above reﬁnement strategy is useful for obtaining accurate approximations of a single quantity of interest, we need to follow a diﬀerent approach for approximating several quantities of interest. One possibility is to
construct one adapted grid for each quantity of interest. However, to generate and reﬁne multiple grids may become
computationally rather expensive. In addition, to maintain several grids increases the implementation complexity.
In this subsection, we propose an alternative solution for the design of a multigoal-oriented hp-adaptive reﬁnement
strategy.
• First, we deﬁne the new quantity of interest
M

luNEW (w) :=
i=1

li (w)
∀w ∈ V,
li (u)

(5)

where u is the solution of the direct problem. However, for the stopping criteria, we will utilize the condition
M

luS T OP (w) :=
i=1

At the discrete level, we have:

|li (w)|
≤ T OL/100 ∀w ∈ V,
|li (u)|
M

luNEW
(whp ) :=
hp
i=1

li (whp )
∀whp ∈ Vhp .
li (uhp )

(6)

(7)

A self-adaptive goal-oriented hp-reﬁnement strategy based on the above stopping criteria allows us to satisfy
Equation (3), since
|li (uhp ) − li (u)|
∗ 100 ≤ luS T OP (ehp ) ∗ 100 ≤ T OL .
(8)
max
i
|li (u)|
REMARK: Quantity of interest l(u) = maxi |li (u)| cannot be used directly for adaptivity because it is not linear,
while quantity l(u) = i |li (u)| requires too many reﬁnements before we can satisfy Equation (3), as we will
illustrate in Section “Numerical Results”.

• Second, we correct Equation (7) to account for those li such that the relative error of li (uhp ) (in percentage) is
already below the desired error tolerance T OL. Namely, we consider:
M

luNEW
(whp ) :=
hp

Ri (ehp )
i=1

li (whp )
∀whp ∈ Vhp ,
li (uhp )

(9)

where Ri (ehp ) is an estimate of the relative error in the i-th quantity of interest. From a practical point of view,
this relative error can be estimated by approximating the exact solution with the solution in a globally reﬁned
h/2, p + 1-grid.
3. Implementation
In this section, we discuss the main implementation aspects needed to extend the goal-oriented hp-adaptive strategy described in [10] to the case of multiple goals considered in this paper. Given a hp-grid, goal-oriented algorithms
˜
are intended to deliver the next optimal hp-grid
by maximizing the so-called error decrease rate.
The main idea for the eﬃcient implementation of the multigoal-oriented adaptive algorithm consists of the following: given a solution uhp , we ﬁrst compute Equation (9) in order to build the right-hand-side of the dual (adjoint)
problem. Then, we apply the existing self-adaptive goal-oriented reﬁnement strategy with the newly deﬁned righthand-side for the dual problem.
4. Model Problem
In this section, we describe a model problem used to evaluate the performance of our multigoal-oriented adaptive
strategy. The model problem is based on time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations that we present next. Then, we introduce a variational formulation corresponding to Maxwell’s equations, and ﬁnally we describe the speciﬁc material
properties, geometry, sources and receivers corresponding to our model problem.
4.1. Time-Harmonic Maxwell’s Equations
Assuming a time-harmonic dependence of the form e jωt , with ω denoting angular frequency, Maxwell’s equations
in linear media can be written as

In the above equations, H and E denote the magnetic and electric ﬁelds, respectively, real-valued tensors , μ, and
σ stand for dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and electrical conductivity of the media, respectively, ρe
denotes the electric charge distribution, and Jimp , Mimp are representations for the prescribed, impressed electric and
magnetic current sources, respectively.
For simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the so-called transverse electric (T Ez ) mode in two spatial dimensions
(x, and y), i.e., we will assume that H x = Hy = Ez = 0.
4.1.1. Closure of the Computational Domain
A variety of BCs can be imposed on the boundary ∂Ω of a computational domain Ω such that the diﬀerence
between the solution of such a problem and the solution of the original problem deﬁned over R2 is small (see [14]).
For example, it is possible to use an inﬁnite element technique, a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML), a boundary element
technique or an absorbing BC. In our model problem, we shall impose a homogeneous Dirichlet BC on the boundary
of a suﬃciently large computational domain, since the EM ﬁelds decay exponentially in the presence of lossy media.
Thus, we will impose n×E = 0 on the boundary Γ = ∂Ω.

4.1.2. E-Variational Formulation
In this subsection, we describe our method in terms of the unknown electric ﬁeld E. First, we deﬁne the L2 -inner

4.1.3. Geometry, Material Properties, Sources, and Receivers
We describe our model problem in Fig. 1, where we consider a 40m × 40m computational domain composed of
a material with homogeneous resistivity equal to 1Ω · m, and relative permeability and permittivity equal to 1. The
source (represented in the ﬁgure with a blue square) is prescribed by an impressed volume line current Jimp (x, y) =
(ˆx + yˆ ) operating at 2 Mhz, and it is located at the origin of coordinates (0,0). Nine receivers (represented in the
ﬁgure with black squares) measure the horizontal component of the electric ﬁeld, and are located at positions Rx1 =
(1m, 1m), Rx2 = (−2m, 2m), Rx3 = (−3m, −3m), Rx4 = (4m, −4m), Rx5 = (5m, 5m), Rx6 = (−6m, 6m), Rx7 =
(−7m, −7m), Rx8 = (8m, −8m), and Rx9 = (9m, 9m), respectively. The objective of the problem is to determine

5. Numerical Results
In this section, we study numerically the performance of the multigoal oriented adaptive strategy when solving
the model problem described in the previous Section.
First, we consider a goal-oriented adaptive strategy based on minimizing the error at a particular receiver (for
example, receiver 4). In Fig. 2, we display the convergence history (relative error vs. problem size) when we consider
as our quantity of interest the solution at the fourth receiver. We observe that the error at the fourth receiver rapidly
decreases to the desired 1% error level, while the error in the remaining receivers remains large. The ﬁnal goal-oriented
hp-grid (see Fig. 3) clearly demonstrates the poor accuracy that it will produce in the solution at most receivers, since
reﬁnements only take place around the transmitter and the fourth receiver antenna.

Figure 2: Convergence curves using a goal-oriented adaptive strategy intended to minimize the error at the fourth receiver antenna. Diﬀerent curves
correspond to diﬀerent receivers.

intended to minimize the error at the fourth receiver antenna. Diﬀerent colors indicate diﬀerent polynomials orders of approximation, from p=1
(dark blue) to p=8 (pink).

Second, we consider a goal-oriented adaptive strategy based on minimizing the sum of the errors at all receivers. In
Fig. 4, we display the convergence history intended to minimize the sum of the errors at all receivers. This convergence
history reﬂects that error at the receivers located close to the transmitter (those measuring the largest values on the
electromagnetic ﬁelds) rapidly decreases to the desired 1% error level, while the error in the remaining receivers
remains large. The ﬁnal goal-oriented hp-grid (see Fig. 5) conﬁrms these results.

curves correspond to diﬀerent receivers.

intended to minimize the sum of the errors at all receiver antennas. Diﬀerent colors indicate diﬀerent polynomials orders of approximation, from
p=1 (dark blue) to p=8 (pink).

Finally, we consider our proposed multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy intended to minimize simultaneously the
error at all receiver antennas. The convergence history displayed in Fig. 6 shows the superior performance of our
method. The error at all receivers decreases to the desired 1% error level. The ﬁnal multigoal-oriented hp-grid is
displayed in Fig. 7. We observe intense reﬁnements towards all receiver antennas. Fig. 8 shows the ﬁnal solution

6. Conclusion
We proposed a new multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy for hp-FEM. This adaptive strategy delivers a single
optimal hp-grid intended to approximate simultaneously the solution of multiple quantities of interest.
The performance of our adaptive strategy has been illustrated with a 2D time-harmonic electromagnetics problem
in a homogeneous media. The multigoal-oriented adaptive algorithm has demonstrated a superior performance in
comparison with a reﬁnement strategy based on a single quantity of interest or the sum of all of them.
Our proposed multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy is easy to implement, it can be applied to multiphysics and
inverse problems, and its computational cost is similar to that of a single goal-oriented adaptive strategy.
