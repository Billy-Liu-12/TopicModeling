Abstract
The speed and range of epidemic spreading is strongly inﬂuenced by the topology and dynamics of the relevant
transmission network. This is, however, not a uni-directional relationship. The mutual interaction between epidemic
spreading and the evolution of the transmission network is described within a new mathematical framework by a closed
set of partial diﬀerential equations. This allows to investigate the inﬂuence of demographic change on epidemic events.
These may arise in response to the epidemic itself or due to external factors. The use of the method is demonstrated
in case studies dealing with epidemics on transmission networks with Poisson and scale free degree distributions.
The impact of demographic and behavioural change on epidemics and their control is pointed out and analysed in
detail. The presented technique is computationally eﬃcient and can help to extend the scope of current approaches in
computational modeling of disease spreading.

1. Introduction
While epidemic spreading of infectious agents is a global threat to public health there is large variability in the
characteristics of particular epidemic events. Diﬀerences in transmission routes among infectious agents and local
conditions inﬂuencing the establishment of infectious contacts strongly shape the transmission network on which
epidemics propagate. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) with HIV infections as the most prominent example show
quite diﬀerent spreading patterns than diseases which are transmitted by air-borne pathogens such as for example
inﬂuenza. But even for the same pathogen remarkable diﬀerences in local epidemics may occur due to a variety of
factors such as population density, mobility or cultural habits. This can equally be seen for HIV [1, 2] and inﬂuenza
epidemics or pandemics [3, 4, 5, 6]. It is therefore essential for realistic epidemic modelling not only to consider the
features of the pathogen but also the characteristics of its host population. This topic has speciﬁcally gained attention
in recent years and several models have been developed with diﬀerent foci and areas of application. Compartmental
models can distinguish between particular subpopulations and study epidemic dynamics within and between these
groups [7]. Although their resolution regarding local dynamics is relatively low they often provide good results,
especially for airborne infections such as inﬂuenza in which infectious contacts are fuzzy [8]. Network and pair
models allow for a more detailed consideration of the transmission network topology by tracing individuals according

to their number of infectious contacts [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], sometimes also considering correlations and clustering in
the way contacts are made [15, 16, 17, 14]. However, the transmission network is not a static support of the epidemic
process but instead subject to dynamical change: The contact patterns between susceptible and infected hosts change
in response to epidemics and possibly external factors such as demographic processes [18]. Hosts may further actively
reduce their infectious contacts [19, 20] or take preventive measures such as vaccinations [21]. We will address the
subject of transmission network dynamics and focus on the co-evolution of topology and epidemic prevalence in the
context of demographic change. This is feasible thanks to a recently developed mathematical framework [18] which
allows for a quantitative analysis of the interplay between transmission network topology and epidemic spread. In
addition, the method is not limited to a static population but allows for individuals who enter or leave the population.
These demographic processes become relevant if natural birth and death or migrational eﬀects cannot be neglected.
2. The model
As sketched in Fig. 1 we will focus our analysis on epidemics of diseases that lead to death of the host after
some time of infection, that is hosts get infected at a rate r and die at a rate μ. As this description is mathematically
closely related to SIR models [22] we will, in analogy, refer to it as SID model. In addition to the epidemic dynamic,
persons enter and leave the population at a rate η. This may represent natural birth and death processes or alternatively
migration phenomena.
As developed in [18], this system can be described by a set of partial diﬀerential equations for which the notation
given in Tab 1 will be used: The evolution equations for the number of susceptible and infected hosts S and I reﬂect

Figure 1: In the SID model infection is transmitted at a rate r along infectious contacts and leads to death in the host at a rate μ. Susceptible
persons enter the population at a rate η which is identical to the rate at which persons leave the population. While the model does not capture the
full complexity of the transmission network’s structure it takes care of heterogeneous contact patterns in the host population. The propagation of
infections among persons with diﬀerent numbers of infectious contacts k is monitored on the basis of the degree distributions pS k and pIk among
susceptible and infected hosts (i.e. their probability generating functions gS (x.t) and gI (x, t)).

Equations (1-2) consider that there are diﬀerent (conditional) probabilities for contacts made by susceptible or infected
hosts to point to infected hosts due to local clustering of infected cases (i.e. pS I pII ). Their time evolution can be
derived by tracing how contacts are established and lost between epidemic groups [18]:

The occurrence of the probability generating function gS (x, t) in equations (3-4) shows that the time evolution of pS I
and pII , i.e. the mixing between epidemic groups, is intimately related to the topological evolution of the transmission
network. Therefore, the set of equations cannot be closed without equations for the probability generating functions

Equations (1-6) provide a framework in which a wide range of epidemic phenomena can be studied. The combination of epidemic equations (i.e. for S , I, pS I , pII ) and equations for the transmission network topology (i.e. gS (x, t),
gI (x, t)) show that epidemics are not only shaped by their transmission network but that there are reciprocal dependencies. In particular, it allows to study the impact of demographic change that can be introduced by persons newly
entering the population with a range of diﬀerent contact patterns (deﬁned via g¯ (x, t)).
3. Results and Discussion
We study demographic and behavioural change in diﬀerent epidemic scenarios to analyse their mutual interdependencies. To make these eﬀects more transparent, we focus on synthetic populations in which individuals have an
average number of 3 contacts, however, being either rather homogeneously distributed (Poisson degree distribution

is transmitted via infectious contacts at a rate r = 0.2 from which hosts die at a rate μ = 0.1 (in arbitrary units of

average number of contacts is k = 3, the epidemic parameters are r = 0.2 and μ = 0.1, and η = 0.01 (in arbitrary units of time). Epidemic
prevalence (top row) and the evolution in the probability generating functions g¯ (x, t), gS (x, t), gI (x, t) and g(x, t) (rows two to ﬁve, contour plots

distributions in the number of contacts made by persons entering the population (via the probability generating functions g¯ (x, t) shown in blue). In
the left column persons enter the population with the original distribution in the number of contacts (¯g(x, t) = g(x, 0)), the middle column shows a
situation in which contacts are made according to the current situation in the population (¯g(x, t) = g(x, t)), the right column corresponds to a linear
decrease in the average number of contacts made by persons entering the population.

the population at a rate η = 0.01. For both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous case we consider three possible
scenarios:
1. individuals enter the population with the original distribution in the number of contacts (¯g(x, t) = g(x, 0), left
column),
2. individuals enter the population with the current distribution in the number of contacts (¯g(x, t) = g(x, t), middle
column), or
3. individuals enter the population with a time dependent distribution in the number of contacts with decreasing
mean value (¯g(x, t), right column).
Fig. 2 shows the number of susceptible and infected persons throughout the epidemic (top panel) and how their
patterns in contact behaviour change during the epidemic. This can be seen in the temporal evolution of the probability
generating functions gS (x, t), gI (x, t) and g(x, t) deﬁning the degree distributions in the susceptible, infected and total
population (rows 3 to 5). One characteristic parameter is the average number of contacts in these subgroups, i.e.
k A = gA (1, t), A ∈ {S , I}, as well as in the total population ( k = g (1, t)) shown in the bottom panel. Fig. 2

. The initial

average number of contacts is k = 3 (γ = 1.615, κ = 20), the epidemic parameters are r = 0.2 and μ = 0.1, and η = 0.01 (in arbitrary units
of time). Epidemic prevalence (top row) and the evolution in the probability generating functions g¯ (x, t), gS (x, t), gI (x, t) and g(x, t) (rows two to
ﬁve, contour plots interpolate between 0 and 1 lightening up in steps of 0.1) are shown in three scenarios with diﬀerent demographic processes.
These are deﬁned by distributions in the number of contacts made by persons entering the population (via the probability generating functions
g¯ (x, t) shown in blue). In the left column persons enter the population with the original distribution in the number of contacts (¯g(x, t) = g(x, 0)), the
middle column shows a situation in which contacts are made according to the current situation in the population (¯g(x, t) = g(x, t)), the right column
corresponds to a linear increase in the exponent γ (from 1.615 to 3.615), i.e. a decrease in the average number of contacts among persons entering
the population.

shows that infected individuals have a higher average number of infectious contacts than susceptible individuals in the
expansion phase of the epidemics which generally decline to lower levels thereafter. The slow background process of
persons entering and leaving the population at a rate η = 0.01 only mildly aﬀects the expansion phase. However, the
later stages of the epidemic strongly depend on the contact patterns of newly entering individuals. If persons appear
with the original contact behaviour (left column) infections may become persistent. If newly entering individuals
adjust their contact patterns to those found in the population at that time (middle column) or another scheme with
suﬃcient reduction in the number of infectious contacts (right column) the epidemic dies out. This shows how the
epidemic results in a shift in contact behaviour due to the increased death rates among those hosts with many infectious
contacts. It can further be seen that a decrease in risk behaviour, i.e. a reduction of infectious contacts, among those
entering the population has marked impact on epidemic control.
These self-selection processes become even more apparent in a more heterogeneous, scale free network with the
same average number of infectious contacts per person. Fig. 3 shows that due to the larger heterogeneity in risk
behaviour there is much stronger accumulation of super-spreaders with highly increased numbers of contacts among
those being infected during the fast expansion phase of the epidemic. This results in an even stronger shift towards
risk avoidance behaviour than in the more homogeneous Poisson network. In consequence, the epidemic ceases faster
than in the homogeneous population if the contact behaviour of the residual population is mimicked by those newly
entering the host population.
4. Conclusions and future works
We have presented a mathematical framework which allows to understand the co-evolution of epidemic prevalence
and transmission network topology in a quantitative and detailed fashion. Both pathogen features as well as the initial
transmission network topology can be ﬂexibly parametrised which allows to study epidemics in very general settings, speciﬁcally in cases where demographic background processes cannot be neglected. This is important for HIV
epidemics which span decades during which natural birth and death processes are relevant. However, demographic
change may also occur due to migration phenomena between host populations. Metapopulation models provide a
powerful framework to model epidemic spreading in and between segregated host populations and have played an
important role in recent pandemic preparedness [5, 23]. These could be further improved if not only the strength of
migrational ﬂow would be considered but also its impact on the structure of the local transmission networks as derived
in our current framework. The closed set of partial diﬀerential equations ﬁnally allows for a computationally eﬃcient
analysis of epidemic phenomena. While this is an advantage for exploratory studies in large populations future improvements should also take stochastic ﬂuctuations into account. Further directions of future research include an
extension to other SIR-type epidemics possibly with active intervention strategies such as vaccination or distancing.
This will complement earlier approaches which have been restricted to transmission networks with simpler and more
homogeneous structures [19, 20, 21]. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study variations in the rules for demographic change. While new contacts are currently made randomly there might we situations in which mechanisms
such as preferential attachment would be more adequate - which again will inﬂuence epidemic spread.
