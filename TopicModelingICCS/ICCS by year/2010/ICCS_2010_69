Abstract
A mechanical spike is a device used to mechanically act on the bow shock ahead of an airplane in supersonic
ﬂight. This action results in improved ﬂight conditions. We will investigate here the eﬀects of the axial generation
of a two-hundred-micrometer width cylindrical plasma ahead a quasi-realistic nose proﬁle of centimeter width. The
device is named plasma spike by analogy to the above-cited mechanical device. This plasma spike is a source of both
momentum and energy for the neighboring ﬂuid.

1. Introduction
A central question in aeronautics is to improve the ﬂight conditions of an aircraft. Among the diﬀerent ways to
go, various mechanisms of ﬂow control have been investigated, both experimentally and numerically, during the last
decades [9]. We are interested here in simulating the eﬀects of a plasma actuator on a supersonic ﬂow. In the studied
device, a "virtual spike" appears as energy is deposited into the ﬂow by a dense plasma coming from an electrodeless
laser-guided discharge. This work is a ﬁrst step towards a better understanding of the mechanisms at hand as well as
the assertion of the expectable drag reduction.
Works on similar topics have been conducted for instance in [4], [6] and [7]. The authors of [4] propose a very
detailed model in order to account for the eﬀects of a Nd:YAG laser energy deposition in air for supersonic ﬂow
control. The process was modelled from the plasma generation by the laser to its interaction with the ﬂuid ahead of a
sphere. In [6], the authors study the eﬀects of instantaneous energy deposition taken into account as ﬂuid heating on a
supersonic ﬂow ahead of a cone. Parametric studies were led depending on the upstream ﬂow velocity as well as the
cone angle using a multi-domain WENO scheme to simulate 2-D axisymmetric Euler equations. The authors of [7]
investigate the possibility of creating steering moments by oﬀ-axis plasma heat addition ahead of a cone. They use a
3-D ﬂuid solver in order to do so for diﬀerent kinds of heating processes and look at the eﬀects of diﬀerent parameters
on the observed results.

Due to the speciﬁcities of the envisioned device, based on involved time scales, we assume as a ﬁrst approximation
that plasma generation is decoupled from its eﬀects on the ﬂuid. Under this assumption, one natural question is then
to look at the eﬀects of the introduction of a plasma of determined energy on the ﬂuid. Answering this question would
give us a good idea of what is needed to be done during plasma generation.
Another aspect would be to get a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The previous question is
of central interest considering that the device we investigate should be used in a pulsed way. The speciﬁcities of our
discharge allow us to propose a simpliﬁed, numerically cost-friendly model, aimed at answering the above questions.
In order to do so, important coupling mechanisms between ﬂuid and plasma have been investigated. This model is
also intended for being the basis of a larger one integrating to some degree more accurate physics concerning the
plasma-ﬂuid interactions as well as the mechanisms behind plasma generation.
After explaining our modelling assumptions, we will comment the qualitative results they yield. In the asymptotics of small Debye length, we consider a two-ﬂuid model with two temperatures [1]. This 2D-axisymmetric model
couples the physics governing the plasma with compressible Euler type equations accounting for the ﬂuid dynamics.
Several time and space scales are involved in this problem as the plasma is by several orders of magnitude thinner and
more reactive than the ﬂuid as far as the densities are concerned.

2. The modelling assumptions.
We will detail here the assumptions made in order to obtain a simpliﬁed model, the one our simulations are actually
based upon. Air chemistry is an intricate topic and in our case air will be seen as a ﬁctive matter : to this end, we
introduce a ﬁctive air molecule (denoted A in what follows). The considered species are then the neutrals A, the ﬁrst
ionized state A+ and the electrons e− . The underlying kinetics are the ionization reaction:
A + e− → A+ + 2e− ,
and the three-body recombinations:
A+ + e − + e − → A + e − ,

(1)

A+ + e− + A → A + A.

(2)

The reactions (1) and (2) are used to describe the kinetics of plasma degradation. Or course, a much more
detailed model could be considered for air kinetics (see [5] for instance). We choose to consider this simple kinetics
since our focus lies on the numerical simulation of multiphysics coupling. Considering more elaborate kinetics also
means complexifying the coupling mechanisms, hence, in the absence of preliminary studies, the understanding of
phenomena occuring for the whole coupled system may be greatly impeded.
Moreover it has been proven in [1] that, for the kind of plasma currently investigated, such a simpliﬁed model
leads to satisfying numerical results as far as the eﬀects on the ﬂow are concerned. Describing accurately the plasma
dynamics remains beyond the scope of this paper.
The reaction frequencies associated to these reactions, given in s−1 , are respectively denoted νi , νrc,n and νrc,e .
Their expressions are detailed in the appendix.
Consequently the conservation of mass for the diﬀerent species can be expressed as:
∂t ne + ∇.(ne ve ) = ne (νi − νrc,n − νrc,e ),
∂t n+ + ∇.(n+ v+ ) = n+ (νi − νrc,n − νrc,e ),
∂t nn + ∇.(nn v) = −nn (νi − νrc,n − νrc,e ).

We are interested in a dense plasma, which implies it has a small Debye length. We opt then for a quasi-neutral
model, which is valid in the limit of small enough Debye length. Practically we assume that, at the scale of every
considered volume, the local density of positive charge equilibrates the density of negative ones: ne = n+ .
Due to elastic collisions with the neutrals, we have v+ vn . We choose to take v+ = vn .
Moreover the ﬂux of charged particles Γ := −e(ne ve − n+ v+ ) is assumed to be divergence free in order to ensure
the conservation of the charge.
As commonly assumed as a ﬁrst approximation (congruence assumption [8]), the electronic ﬂux Γ is close to zero
which leads in turn to the velocity ve being close to the velocity of the neutrals vn , modulo a diﬀusive correction
(ambipolar diﬀusion assumption):
ve = vn − Da

∇ne
.
ne

Concerning the temperature of ionic molecules, we assume that T + = T n . Hence no equation relative the state of
the ions needs to be computed. More precisely, the quantities whose evolution needs to be computed are: (n, v, T )
for the ﬂuid, where n := nn + n+ is the density of heavy particles, v := vn = v+ is the velocity of heavy particles and
T := T n = T + their temperature. For the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we are in a case where magnetic eﬀects are negligible.
The electric ﬁeld will not be solved here but considered as a parameter acting as a source of energy for the electrons.
We get then the following system of equations, where p := nkB T denotes the ﬂuid pressure and pe := ne kB T e the
electronic pressure.

3. Numerical aspects.
2-D axisymmetric simulations were performed using a compressible ﬂuid solver coupled with a plasma solver.
For time iteration in our ﬂuid solver, we use the block inversion spatially split approximate factorization scheme.
As a limiter, Venkatakrishan’s is used. The chosen structured ﬂuid solver allows to solve Navier-Stokes as well as
Euler equations. As presented above we will consider here a non-viscous model for the ﬂuid. The grid we use is
reﬁned on the Mach cone as well as on the axial area containing the plasma. Globally, the method chosen is based

on Finite Volumes and the integration in time is implicit for the ﬂuid and explicit for the plasma. For the plasma, the
MUSCL scheme is used for the computation of the convection terms. The source terms describing the interactions
between ﬂuid and plasma are treated explicitly. Finally, due to the strong multiscale feature of the problem at hand,
the behaviors of the plasma and the ﬂuid are solved on diﬀerent time and space scales.
We use subcycling for the time integration and a ﬁner, precisely localized grid to solve the plasma behavior. These
results are then averaged on a rougher grid used for the computation of the ﬂuid behavior.
Let us detail our interpolation procedure. In a conical area around the axisymmetric axis r = 0, the 2-D plasma
mesh and the 2-D ﬂuid mesh are the same in the axial direction, while, in the radial direction the plasma mesh is much
thinner and covers only a small part of the ﬂuid mesh (r ≤ 600μm). We use then linear interpolation in the radial
direction. By testing diﬀerent meshes, we checked that enough points were taken for the ﬂuid grid in the plasma
channel in order to get accurate results. We underline that the same mesh is used to search for a steady state and to
test the plasma eﬀects. Due to the local reﬁnement needed near the plasma column, studying properly convergence
towards a steady state is already an issue.
As both the time step and mesh are diﬀerent for ﬂuid and plasma we use the prime superscript for the plasma.
For instance nke,(i , j ) denotes the electronic density on the cell whose center is (ri , z j ) at time tk . tk is the physical time
reached after k time iterations on the ﬂuid.

4. The simulated experiment.
In this work we are interested in the eﬀects of energy and momentum deposition on a ﬂow. We choose to focus
on commenting qualitatively the observed eﬀects. The considered dimensions of our proﬁle are analogous to ones we
could choose for a physical experiment. We ﬁrst perform an aerodynamic simulation that converges towards a steady
state.
As we assume that a dense plasma appears instantaneously, the mechanisms of creation and sustainment of the
plasma are not investigated. We assume that the created plasma has properties similar to the one observed in thunder.
Namely, we take:
ne = 1024 m−3 , T e = 30000K.
As described above, the electronic velocity is deduced from the other quantities.
The structure of the plasma is assumed cylindrical, the values of the plasma densities are given as an analytic
function with a smooth transition to the natural electronic density of air assumed to be 1010 m−3 . The approximate
length of the diﬀuse plasma column is 25cm for a radius under 200μm. The plasma domain covers the range r ≤
600μm.

These numbers illustrate that the considered phenomena occur on disparate time scales.
5.1. The initial ﬂuid state
We compute a steady state for a truncated quasi-realisatic proﬁle put under an incoming ﬂuid at Mach 3. The plane
proﬁle is constructed analytically, which proves to be useful during mesh generation. The ﬂuid is considered as an
ideal gas with a speciﬁc heat ratio γ = 1.4. For the presented results, the temperature of the incoming ﬂow is taken as
260K while its molecular density is 2.1025 m−3 . The computed steady state is the ﬂuid state prior to the instantaneous
plasma appearance.
5.2. The plasma/ﬂuid behavior during the ﬁrst moments
We describe here the phenomena observed in the time window 0 < t < 3μs. The density of the ﬂuid does not
change signiﬁcantly during this period. The plasma recombines very fast until it reaches a state where it is not dense
and hot enough to produce any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the ﬂuid anymore. During the ﬁrst microsecond the ﬂuid remains
almost steady. The evolution of the plasma depends on the ﬂuid properties. We have a localized strong heterogeneity
of the ﬂuid characteristics due to the bow shock. On one hand, in the zone of high density and pressure behind the
central part of the shock, the plasma decay is faster, while it is slower ahead of it. On the other hand, as the density
of the ﬂuid is higher behind the shock, for a same plasma state, the energy transmitted to the ﬂuid is higher. Indeed,
while the energy deposition by elastic collisions is weaker, since proportional to T e − T, the global increase in energy
is due to the three body recombination with a neutral. As a result of these two conﬂicting eﬀects, we observe in Figure
2 the variations of ﬂuid pressure and temperature near the shock after 3μs.

Figure 2: Proﬁle of the shock after plasma heating at time 3μs. We see that the ﬂow conditions inside the bow shock impedes the ﬂuid heating in
this area.

Contrary to what happened in the initial state, in the very thin channel heated by the plasma the temperature
becomes higher ahead of the shock than behind it. Let us remark that one microsecond after the introduction of the
plasma, as the density remains unchanged in the heated region, the pressure shock proﬁle is changed, as a "spike" is
added to it. Let us also note that the observed eﬀects of momentum transfer between the ﬂuid and the plasma are not
very strong. The radius of the obtained heated channel is less than half a millimeter. Due to the short life time of the
introduced plasma, most of the gas temperature increase occurs during the ﬁrst twenty nanoseconds.
5.3. The resulting aerodynamic eﬀects
The resulting aerodynamic eﬀects of the gas heating occur on a far larger time scale. After the gas heating, the
overpressure in the heated central channel disappears in less than thirty microseconds. This is accompanied by the
formation of a low density channel expanding radially over time.
The radius of the obtained low density channel is far from being large enough to observe any real improvement of
the ﬂight conditions due to its existence. However, the existence of this channel leads, by conservation of momentum,
to a high velocity ﬂuid income.
This thin column of ﬂuid aﬀects the structure of the velocity shock by locally pushing it inside. The reﬂected wave
makes the ﬂuid ﬂow back. The interesting eﬀects we obtain are a result of this phenomenon. The localization of the
central part of the shock front is pushed ahead. The changes occur spatially on a scale of the same order of magnitude
as the one of our truncated proﬁle, which has a radius equal to two centimeters. The front is localized at the frontier
between the two ﬂuids ﬂowing with opposite radial directions.

This new shock front travels ahead of the plane nose before being pushed back into initial position. Let us remark
that heating locally occurs on the axis as the two ﬂuids with opposite ﬂowing direction meet.
As shown by Figure 3, positive eﬀects begin to appear on the ﬂight conditions about 15 ms after the plasma was
introduced. The eﬀects cease to be signiﬁcant over 200 ms after the plasma introduction.
Although we can observe a peak in the temperature shock proﬁle, these numerical results suggest that the corresponding velocity jump along the spike results in an almost continuous Mach number distribution.
We obtain a drag reduction up to about 21%. These eﬀects were produced by an energy deposited into the the ﬂuid
of about 10 mJ. As 2-D axisymmetric computations were conducted, the lower parts in Figure 4 were reconstructed
by symmetry. We choose to show the ﬂuid state at 50 ms, since the drag coeﬃcient is reaching a minimum around
this time.

6. Conclusion and perspectives
Due to our simulations, we observe that although the created non-equilibrium plasma column is very thin and
short-lived, it can have long lasting positive eﬀects over the ﬂuid. In order to improve the quantitativity of our results,
we have to continue to investigate the dominant physical eﬀects governing the energetic transfer between ﬂuid and
plasma. In parallel, modelling and simulating the mechanisms hiddened for now in our initial state would be very
interesting as it would allow a good estimation of energy eﬀeciency. This extension is not so straigthforward as it
would need to analyze the interaction of electromagnetism and optics with the physics presently taken into account.
Finally, as the device has to be used in a pulsed fashion, we can use the proposed model, with further description of
the physics if necessary, in order to test through numerical simulations how the device should be operated.
