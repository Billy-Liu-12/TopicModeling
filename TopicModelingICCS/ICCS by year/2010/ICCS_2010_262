Abstract
In this work, conductor-like screening for real solvents (COSMO-RS) calculations were carried out using COSMOtherm
program in conjunction with Gaussian03 packages. The objective was to predict thermodynamic properties for two nitrogen-rich
energetic materials which are less harmful for the environment than the conventional ones, namely 3,6-di(hydrazino)-1,2,4,5tetrazine (DHT) and 3,3‚Äô-azo-bis(6-amino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine) (DAAT) for which no experimental data are available to our best
knowledge. COSMO-RS approach is a combination of quantum chemical and statistical thermodynamic basis, which allow a
physically meaningful description of molecular interactions between pure molecules and solvents in solution. Recently, this
approach has been used for the prediction of an enormous number of physicochemical properties especially aqueous solubility,
Henry's law constant, vapor pressure and partition coefficient. The vapor pressure of pure compounds is one of the most
important thermodynamic properties required for the chemical process design as well as for the fate assessment of pollutants in
the environment. To validate the accuracy of COSMO-RS approach for the two molecules of interest, six reference energetic
molecules have been studied, for which experimental data are available, such as cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX),
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane
(CL-20), 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) and n-methyl-p-nitroaniline (MNA). From predicted results, a good
agreement has been noted. DAAT molecule shows a lower volatility in the medium so that a low detectability compared to the
DHT and other reference molecules. Both DHT and DAAT showed negative logarithmic values of Octanol-Water partition
coefficients, this means that they don‚Äôt have the tendency to enhance the bioaccumulation process in soils.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the environmental issues force to find urgent solutions to protect our planet. As chemists, it is
worthwhile to take into account environmental impacts of chemical compounds prior to their synthesis in
laboratories. Recently, the use of molecular modeling as a mean for predicting physicochemical properties has been
of great interest for various topics in research. Among the investigated properties are the solubility [1, 2], Henry's

law constant [3], vapor pressure [4] and octanol-water partition coefficient [5]. In fact, octanol-water partition
coefficient is widely known to be an effective tool to evaluate the toxicity of many explosives [6]. Moreover, the
estimation of the aqueous solubility for a substance basically predicts the mobility of the substance in presence of
solvents which represent its environment. The usefulness of these properties are even more important for energetic
materials because of the past problems that have caused many environmental contaminations [7]. By being aware of
the risks involved by the use of energetic materials or explosives, it would be easier to prevent and control the
source of contamination processes. The interest in the vapor pressure or Henry‚Äôs law constant is related to the
volatility of the substance in the air. Experimental values of these properties are abundant in the literature for more
common small molecules. However, there is a scarcity of experimental data regarding large and new energetic
molecules. The volatility or vapor pressure has a direct correlation with the detectability [8] which is an helpful
property in standoff detection researches of explosives in defence and public security applications. Unfortunately, no
experimental data are available for the vapor pressure of some compounds and it is difficult to be determined
experimentally.
In this work, we propose predictions for physicochemical properties of two nitrogen rich compounds, namely
3,6-di(hydrazino)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DHT) and 3,3‚Äô-azo-bis(6-amino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine) (DAAT) using ‚ÄúCOnductorlike Screening MOdel for Real Solvents‚Äù (COSMO-RS) method [9, 10]. This method is used to validate
experimental data or when no experimental data are available. For purpose of validation of the theoretical approach,
we have selected some explosives for which experimental data are available. These compounds are
cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (HMX), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX),
2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethylene (FOX-7) and
n-methyl-p-nitroaniline (MNA). The chemical structures of these molecules are shown in Fig 1. Results of
thermodynamic property predictions of these compounds were compared to literature data and discussed.

2. Methodology
2.1. COSMO-RS
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using Gaussian 03 packages [11]. Optimized
geometries of compounds were performed at 6-31+G(d,p)/B3LYP method [12-14]. Solubilities, Henry‚Äôs law

constants, vapor pressures and octanol-water partition coefficients were estimated using the COSMO-RS method
developed by Klamt and Eckert [15] which is incorporated in COSMOtherm code. In this approach, the ƒ±-profile is
one of the important properties provided by COSMOtherm needed for the estimation of various useful
thermodynamic properties. The ƒ±-profile pi (V) is defined as the probability distribution of surface-charge density
for a given molecule [9, 10, 15] and it is expressed for a molecule i by the following equation:

pi (V)

Ai (V)
Ai

(1)

This probability distribution pi(V) is proportional to the total surface area Ai(ƒ±) of all of the segments around the
molecule at the charge density ƒ± and to Ai which denotes the total cavity surface area.
COSMO-RS method has already proven, for simple systems, to be an effective and useful approach to assess
thermodynamic properties [16-18]. Some works have also been done for energetic materials [19-20]. Charge
distributions, and empirical data, such as the heat of fusion («ªHfus) and melting point (Tfus), are performed by ab
initio calculations. Basically, empirical/experimental data serve as inputs in COSMOtherm code.
2.2. Heat of fusion
The entropy («ªSfus) and enthalpy («ªHfus) of fusion of compounds at a given temperature T are used as input data
in COSMO-RS method for the predictions of thermodynamic properties of a mixture and the free energy of fusion,
given by the following expression:

¬ß

 T fus 'C p , fus ln ¬®
¬∏
¬® T ¬∏
¬® T ¬∏¬∏
fus ¬π
¬©
¬© fus ¬π

(2)

Experimental values are not often available in the literature. In case that «ªHfus is not available, COSMOtherm
program assumes that «ªGfus is equal to zero. For «ªHfus and «ªSfus, the group additivity method which is an effective
method developed by Chickos et al. has been used [21]. This alternative technique is used to predict thermodynamic
properties. Experimental and predicted values of «ªHfus and «ªSfus at fusion temperature for various molecules
investigated in this work are listed in Table 1. The free energy of fusion predicted by COSMOtherm at the room
temperature 298.15K is also presented in Table 1. For all compounds, experimental melting point value has been
used.

3. Results and discussion
As it was mentioned above, specific thermodynamic properties present a particular interest for energetic materials
such as the vapor pressure of pure compounds, solubility of compounds in various solvents, Henry constant and
Octanol-Water partition coefficient. All these properties are based on molecular surface charge densities represented
in ƒ±-profile.
3.1. ƒ±- profile
In order to understand the behavior of molecules in solvents, ƒ±-profile plots of all molecules included Octanol
and water solvents are shown in Fig 2. From Fig 2a, we observe that reference molecules have an asymmetric
distribution of charges while DHT and DAAT compounds present a symmetric distribution (Fig 2b). This
observation indicates how molecules may interact in presence of specific solvents in solution. The octanol ƒ±-profile
is similar to reference molecules. However water ƒ±-profile shows similar distribution-charge densities as those of
DHT and DAAT.

3.2. Vapor pressure
Gas traces of explosives are generally detected in atmosphere. For defence and public security applications,
volatility property predictions of explosives are useful to prevent terrorist attacks. The knowledge of the vapor
pressure, and/or Henry constant is the key. Certainly, the volatility property is directly correlated to the detectability
of a given substance in the air. The vapor pressure of a pure compound is calculated by assuming molecules in ideal
gas phase. In fact, it is often the case when temperatures are lower than 200¬∞C. Using the chemical potential
difference of the molecule i (»ùigX) assumed as an ideal gas and the compound X (»ùXX) is at its liquid state. The vapor
pressure (PXvap) of the pure compound at the temperature T, is expressed by:

In Table 2, decimal logarithmic values for vapor pressure estimated by COSMOtherm program are listed. From
the obtained results we generally note a satisfactory agreement with experimental data for all studied molecules.
However, for low vapor pressures, the gap between experimental and predicted values is slightly higher. These
deviations may be explained in terms of the assumption that molecules are considered as an ideal gas.

Regarding nitrogen-rich energetic molecules investigated in this work, DHT stands out a similar tendency, like
TNT and MNA, its vapor pressure value is much higher than of other compounds. On the other hand, DAAT
molecule presents a lower vapor pressure then a lower volatility. This means that DHT is easier to be detected in
atmosphere than DAAT.
3.3. Henry constant
The Henry constant (kH), is a complementary quantitative measure of explosives volatility property beside the
vapor pressure. The specific characteristic of Henry constant kH is applied to systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.
This constant basically links the solubility of a solute (i) to its partial pressure above the mixture (Pivap) as shown in
equation 3. More often, water-air is the system used. The objective here is to predict the dectetability of several
energetic molecules in water-air environment.

where »ñi(S;T) is the activity coefficient of a solute (S) at the temperature T. The obtained results are listed in
Table 3.
We observe a higher volatility for TNT, DHT and MNA than those estimated for other energetic materials. We
also note that the DAAT molecule stands out with a very low volatility in aqueous phase.

3.4. Octanol-water partition coefficient
The partition coefficient (KOW) is defined as the ratio of the solubility of a given solute (j) in a solvent mixture.

where V1/V2 is the volume ratio of solvents, and »ùj(1) and »ùj(2) are the chemical potentials of the solute in solvents 1
and 2.
Octanol-water is the typical mixture of solvents used for calculations of the partition coefficient. The coefficient
KOW determines the hydrophilic or hydrophobic feature of chemical compounds. It is widely used to especially
characterize the toxicity of substances in soils. In fact, KOW indicates whether or not a substance will have a
tendency to accumulate in biological membranes of living organisms. In other words, it indicates if there is any
prospective which would enhance the bioaccumulation process. Biological membranes are predominantly composed
of lipids, thus a higher partition coefficient value is an indicator that the substance presents a high level of risk of
contamination. The estimated KOW for the eight explosives are presented in Table 4.

The predictive values showed in Table 4, are in satisfactory agreement with those found in the literature. The
comparison of calculated and measured octanol-water partition coefficients indicates that both nitrogen-rich
molecules, DHT and DAAT, are more hydrophilic than the rest of molecules in Table 4. This implies that, these two
molecules are environmentally friendly regarding the bioaccumulation process in soils. This conclusion is in
accordance with ƒ±-profile plots shown in Fig. 2b. Indeed, from this figure, we note that DHT and DAAT show
symmetric charge distributions. Hence, they have a tendency to favor solvents having the same type of charge
distributions, such as water. Unlike, the other studied molecules which show asymmetric charge distributions in Fig.
2a. We note that these molecules have a preference to be surrounded by solvents presenting alike asymmetric charge
distribution profile, such as octanol.
3.5. Solubility
COSMOtherm program also assesses the solubility (xsolj) property using Gibbs free energy of fusion («ªGfus) and
chemical potentials of a pure compound j (»ùj(P)) and a compound j in an infinite dilution in the solvent i (»ùj(i)).

(6)

The molar fraction values are between 0 and 1. When »ùj(P)- »ùj(i) > «ªGfus this leads to a molar fraction value higher
than one, this situation is not possible. To get around this problem, solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) application in
COSMOtherm code was used. The SLE function gives the concentration (xi) at which the solid (i) is in a
thermodynamic equilibrium with the liquid phase in solution. In other words, SLE function determines the solute
mole fraction value which is required for the saturation of a solution. This chemical equilibrium is described by the
following equation:

P Solid

P Liquid
 RT ln( x j )

(7)

where »ùjSolid and »ùjLiquid are the chemical potential of compound (j) in solid and liquid phase, respectively.
Calculations with the SLE function are time-consuming, tough the SLE seems to have the same reliability as the
solubility function. The solubility values in water using equations 6 and 7 are listed in Table 5. In some cases, the
solubility values provided by SLE approach are in very good agreement with experimental data in comparison with
those provided by equation 6.

From Table 5, we note a good reliability on COSMO-RS method regarding aqueous solvents. The obtained
results show higher aqueous solubilities for DHT and DAAT than for the rest of molecules. From simulation results,
we are able to select the appropriate solvent for a given chemical compound. The prediction of solubilities of
compounds in various solvents is an effective tool to avoid many unnecessary tests in labs, while protecting at the
same time the environment. In this work, solubilities of all molecules were also predicted in presence of some
solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetone and acetonitrile (Table 6).

From this table, we note that DHT and DAAT predicted solubility values are higher in presence of DMSO
solvent than with acetonitrile. In addition, the solubility for all molecules in the three solvents is much higher than in
water. We also observe (Table 6) that the predicted solubilities are overestimated compared to experimental ones.
This deviation could be attributed to many factors related to variety of experimental conditions collected from
different references in the literature and also to the empirical data we used as inputs in COSMOtherm simulations.
These errors increase as the solubility value of the compound increases.
4. Conclusion
In summary, using COSMO-RS method we were able to assess the solubility, Henry's law constant (kH), vapor
pressure (Pvap) and octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW). These thermodynamic properties were predicted for
two nitrogen rich molecules DHT and DAAT, and six reference molecules for purpose of validation of the COSMORS approach. A comparison of experimental and estimated values of various properties for reference energetic
molecules was presented and showed a satisfactory agreement. The Henry constant and vapor pressure predicted
values indicated that DAAT has a very lower volatility than DHT molecule. In addition, DHT showed a similar
physicochemical tendency to RDX. Regarding the partition coefficient, both DHT and DAAT molecules present a
negative values for the term log10 (KOW). This conclusion is explained in terms of less threat for bioaccumulation
processes in the environment. Aqueous solubility of both nitrogen-rich molecules is higher than the rest of studied
energetic molecules (RDX, CL-20, FOX-7, TNT and HMX). Their solubility remains higher in polar aprotic
solvents such as DMSO, acetone and acetonitrile. To conclude, laboratory synthesis for the investigated DHT and
DAAT molecules is in progress and measurements of thermodynamic properties will be performed in purpose of
comparison and validation of obtained results with COSMOS-RS approach. The ultimate objective is to use this
helpful tool prior to any tests in labs.
