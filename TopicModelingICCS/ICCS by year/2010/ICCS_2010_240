Abstract
In organisation-based work groups, experts often approach problem solving by combining explicit domain knowledge and
information with their practice-based knowledge in ways that are largely driven by their specific work context. In collaborative ework, such common grounds for decision making offered by a shared work context hardly exist. Designing context-aware
systems to support decision making in collaborative e-work, thus, poses a huge challenge because of the inherent difficulty in
establishing a shared context of work and users adequate for supporting cohesive collaboration and knowledge sharing among
experts across organisational and geographical boundaries. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework, which
incorporates an explicit model of context between the domain model of an application and the activity landscapes of various
individuals, workgroups and organisations collaborating across borders, and between these landscapes and the knowledge
resource space model in an intelligent ubiquitous environment. We argue that an explicit context model will enable a clearer
understanding of the way experts integrate knowledge during problem solving, and thus provide common grounds for decision
making and knowledge sharing during collaborative e-work. We demonstrate how a system based on our proposed model can be
applied to support the reactive, collaborative and proactive modes of decision support in collaborative e-work.

1. Introduction
In organisation-based work groups, the context of decision making, interaction patterns and resources for
supporting work are largely defined as part of the structure and problem solving strategies of an organisation;
whereas in cross-organisational collaborative e-work, such predefined common grounds for cohesive collaborative
decision making hardly exist. As a result, providing context-aware support to decision making in cross-boundary
collaborative e-work presents a huge challenge since a shared context of work and users is difficult to establish.
However in knowledge systems, the need to capture domain specific knowledge and task and domain specific

problem solving methods and heuristics during design is increasingly emphasized [14, 18]. It is no longer sufficient
to design a knowledge-based solution for work process support based on a detailed functional specification of the
system and the use of “normal” computer science know-how [18]. In many knowledge-intensive problem solving
situations, such as in e-health, experts often use a large amount of domain specific knowledge, which allows them to
constrain the problem, to approximate the problem or to reformulate the problem in order to solve a simpler problem
efficiently or to use practice-specific heuristics, which reduces the average complexity of the problem [18].
Recent advances in computing have enabled new forms of dynamic and agile collaboration that allow
geographically distributed individuals to interact with one another independent of time and space in order to harness
globally distributed knowledge resources, and leverage collective intelligence and social creativity across
organisational and workgroup boundaries for improved decision making. More knowledge workers and experts from
various domains including healthcare, education, research and engineering have become increasingly attracted to
this pattern of work. As a result, new ways of conceiving and representing knowledge of context of work and users
are required to enable the realisation of this inherent working pattern of future working environments [24].
We propose, in this paper, a framework to enable collaborative e-work systems to acquire sufficient knowledge
about work and users so as to retrieve contextually relevant information from heterogeneous sources – distributed
databases, knowledge networks and case-based literature – and meaningfully assist disparate workers to engage in
activity-oriented decision making. The proposed framework incorporates an explicit model of context between the
domain model of an application and the activity landscapes of various individuals, workgroups and organisations
collaborating across borders, and between these landscapes and the knowledge resource space model in an
intelligent ubiquitous environment. The aim is to enable a clearer understanding of the way experts integrate
knowledge during problem solving, so as to provide common grounds for decision making and knowledge sharing
during collaborative e-work.
2. Background
Over the last two decades, research in collaborative e-work decision support has focused on enabling
technologies to augment the decision making processes of experts, and to coordinate cross-organisational and crossboundary collaboration and knowledge sharing through formal or informal interactions [20, 21, 23]. Since experts
engage in complex problem solving and are often employed to work across organisations and geographical
boundaries using technology, designers of collaborative e-work systems largely apply knowledge-based systems
techniques to model complex domain knowledge and to capture knowledge about different contexts of work.
Most research efforts on designing knowledge-based systems for intelligent decision support have, more or less,
drawn strength from the knowledge level principle proposed by Alan Newell in his 1982 presidential address to the
AAAI [11]. In the proposal, Alan attempted to answer a basic, but critical question – what it is that a system has,
when it has knowledge, and how that knowledge can be represented.
Various definitions of the term “knowledge” have emerged from diverse research efforts aimed to elucidate the
understanding of knowledge. A common thread among these is that knowledge includes a body of data, information
and meta-information that can be applied to carry out tasks and to generate new information [1, 26] Central to this
understanding of knowledge is the theory that knowledge has two major components – an explicit component,
which has a representation and an tacit part, which is only derivable using some method of inference [25, 27]. A
number of knowledge creation theories the Shinayakana Systems Approach [28], the Rational Theory of Fallible
Intuition [29], the SECI Model [25], and the Pentagram (I5) System [30] have aimed to highlight the interplay
between tacit and explicit knowledge that lead to knowledge creation. Most of these focus on knowledge creation in
corporate decision making. Collaborative e-work, however, presents a different challenge with inherent issues of
knowledge elicitation, representation and management in an open and cross-boundary work environment that must
be addressed.

and organisations collaborating across borders, and between these landscapes and the knowledge resource space
model in an intelligent ubiquitous environment. The goal of the framework is to provide a coherent structure,
through the use of an explicit context model, for unifying the domain knowledge of an application, the practicebased knowledge used by an expert as a result of a length of time of experience and the Web-based information
resources available for supporting work. In other words, it aims to build a ubiquitous creative environment, which
will consist of a domain information set (rules and explicit knowledge resources), a tacit knowledge set (experts’
ways of ‘doing’ captured within the activity landscapes) and contextual models for relating these two towards
effective cross-organisational problem solving and decision making.

3.1. Knowledge Resource Space Model
Any system’s application of knowledge must specify clearly how the knowledge is to be acquired. Knowledge is
basically information with explanation about its value and use. The increasing proliferation of information on the
Web has, for many years, led to more research efforts towards efficient techniques for organising information and
enabling retrieval of relevant information. Several research avenues have been pursued in the attempt to achieve this
goal, and include context-aware retrieval mechanisms, semantic networks and resource organisation models [4, 5].
One of such methods, which influences our concept of a knowledge resource space is the resource space model
introduced by Hai Zhuge in his Knowledge Grid research project [4].
We define a knowledge resource space model as a semantic mechanism for conceptually linking heterogeneous
information within a ubiquitous environment so as to enable effective generation of knowledge to support problem
solving and decision making. The knowledge resource space model uses a mesh network structure to link and
organise information resources in a 3D orthogonal knowledge space. The basis of the knowledge resource space
model is to enable a systematic and knowledge-driven structure for locating resources in a ubiquitous environment.
A resource space is an n-dimensional space where every point uniquely determines one resource or a set of interrelated resources, denoted as RS (X1, X2, …, Xn) or just by name RS in simple. Xi is the name of an axis. Xi = (Ci1,
Ci2, …, Cin) represents an axis with its coordinates and the order between them. C denotes the coordinate name in
form of a noun or a noun phrase. Any name corresponds to a formal or an informal semantic definition in the
domain ontology of the resource [5]. Thus, a resource space provides an n-dimensional space for uniquely locating
information resources. We identify three Web-based sources of information for generating knowledge in a
knowledge resource space model, namely organisational databases, knowledge networks and online digital libraries.

Thus our knowledge resource space model is represented as a 3-dimensional space, where each dimension depicts
resources from each of the three sources.
Within a knowledge resource space, we describe the semantics of an information resource as follows:
• Name – this is an identifier for differentiating one information resource from another. Name can be a userdefined identifier, a keyword within the information content or the topic of the information resource
• Type – type represents the kind of information, e.g. concept information type, task information type or reference
information type
• Author – name(s) of the information creator(s)
• Location – the URL or logical address of the piece of information in a ubiquitous environment
• Affiliation – this is a number describing the source of the information resource – organisational database,
knowledge network or an online digital library or a URL in the public domain as well as the names of the source
database, knowledge network or URL.
• Version – a number that identifies different versions of the same piece of information. Versions are userassigned.
• Ontological Description – this gives a brief conceptual description of an information resource. This could be a
formal description, a natural language description or a template. Ontological descriptions are preferably
represented in XML.
• Context of Use – this describes the history of use (if any). This includes the tasks, cases, activities, etc. where the
piece of information has been used as well as sources (e.g. information resources) it has referred to, used or cited
as well as sources have referred to it, used it or cited it.
The goal of the knowledge resource space model is to create a coherent knowledge-driven information set for
supporting context-aware decision making in collaborative e-work. As explained in the next two sub-sections, the
activity landscape provides the tacit rules and context-specific guidelines, while the domain model provides the
background knowledge necessary to enable the integration of information resources from the information set into
the knowledge-intensive heuristics of problem solving in collaborative e-work.
3.2. Activity Landscape
The next component of our abstract model is the activity landscape. The concept of activity landscape is derived
from the idea of a task environment introduced by Simon and Newell [7]. We use activity landscape to capture the
unique way in which an expert tackles tasks in his local work setting – applying available information to his
experience in relation to contextual constraints. An activity landscape is part mental construct and part physical; it is
the space users interactively construct out of the resources they find when trying to accomplish a task [6]. Kirsh [6]
uses the concept of activity landscape, along with two other constructs – entry point and coordinating mechanism –
to analyse the non-physical setting of an office, namely the state of digital resources, people’s concepts, task state,
social relations and local work culture.
Activity represents a set of related tasks. In applying activity landscape to analyse an e-work environment, we
integrate activity landscape with the concept of activity theory [12, 13, 8, 9, 10]. Activity theory provides a
hierarchical structure for our actions and operations. At the highest level, activity acts as a meaningful and goaldirected frame for holding together actions and operations within a context [19], and for providing a coherent view
of the interrelationships in a collaborative work environment. Activity theory allows for the modelling of problem
solving interactions in an e-work environment from a knowledge level perspective [11]. Several work, such as [15]
have attempted to integrate activity theory with other concepts (such as organisational model) for studying context
of use. Our approach is to use activity theory to analyse and decompose activity into component tasks so as to depict
relevant context variables. Within this process, context is morphed using the technique of ContextMorph [16] in
order to sufficiently understand the subtle interplays between explicit knowledge and information, an expert’s
practice-based knowledge and domain rules during decision making within specific activity landscapes. In a
collaborative e-work setting, ContextMorph is equally used to analyse the different contexts of work of various
organisations in order to enable context-aware support to collaborative problem solving and decision making.

We use the domain model to capture background knowledge of domain of work. Such background knowledge
includes knowledge about terminologies, relationships, concepts, theories, rules and facts (e. g. medical guidelines).
The domain knowledge model comprises all knowledge required, in principle, to solve a problem or to make a
decision. The domain model is built statically during program design time. Owing to the failure of the general
problem solver approach in AI, recent approaches in knowledge systems adopt task specific problem solving
methods, which focuse on the given task [18]. Recently, domain ontologies have been applied to the design of
domain models in order to enable reusable model components, which provide conceptualisations of a specific
domain and are shareable across different tasks [1, 17, 18].
According to the commonKADS approach [1], the knowledge level description of a knowledge system is called
the Model of Expertise [18]. This model separates different kinds of knowledge at three different layers:
• The domain layer contains knowledge about domain-specific concepts, their attributes and their relationships and
it contains domain specific problem-solving patterns.
• The inference layer contains knowledge about the functional behaviour of the problem-solving process. This
layer indicates which inferences are necessary and which data dependencies exist between them.
• The task layer contains knowledge about the goals of a task and the control knowledge required to perform the
task. This layer specifies the sequence of the inferences within the problem-solving process for a specific context
of work.
In our proposed system, both the inference and the task layers are represented in the activity landscape. The
domain model contains the domain primitives, while the activity landscape contains contextual primitives. Domain
primitives describe basic problem guidelines that exist in principle and may be independent of context of work,
while contextual primitives describe problem solving heuristics that exist in practice and are dependent on context of
work.
3.4. Context Model
From the foregoing, the domain knowledge specifies how tasks are carried out in principle, while the activity
landscape models how the tasks are carried out in practice. We introduce an explicit context model to represent the
relationship between the two during problem solving and decision making. The context component is used to model
how experts apply their tacit knowledge and experience to available information (in the knowledge resource space
model) in order to tackle problems and make decisions within their context of work.
Different types of context exist in literature; for this research, our focus is on activity context. Context enables us
sufficiently understand the various ways, situations and often implied procedures that experts use to create new
knowledge during problem solving and decision making, by applying their tacit practice-based knowledge to
available information (explicit knowledge) and domain rules. Using the technique of ContextMorph [16], the
context model enables us to analyse different contexts of work of various organisations in order to facilitate contextaware support to collaborative problem solving and decision making
4. System Architecture
We present an overview of the implementation design of our proposed system (see figure 2). The focus is to
enable synchronous and asynchronous collaboration among distributed experts working across organisational
boundaries. The system is intended to act as an assistant and advisor, by facilitating communication and knowledge
sharing, and suggesting recommendations or augmenting suggestions from collaborating workers, but leaving the
final enforcement of decisions and actions to the users.
The system consists of 6 components (see figure 2). The domain knowledge builder is used to generate
background knowledge about a certain domain of work. Domain knowledge is statically built. The context extractor
derives context information from tasks during collaborative problem solving and decision making. The collaborative
decision support module facilitates collaborative decision making among disparate workers. Often, users send a
query to the system, which searches for information in response. Retrieved information is augmented using the
technique of Suggestion Augmentation and ContextMorph [16]; this is the reactive mode. In the collaborative mode,
user suggestions are equally augmented. The learning and knowledge management module is used to accumulate
patterns of problem solving and decision making in order to enable proactive suggestions to future decision making

tasks. All decision making models are recorded in the system database. The information retrieval module searches
the knowledge resource space – organisational databases, knowledge networks and online digital literature for
relevant information resources. Suggestion module assists or advises in decision making through a series of decision
support functions, which include consider (), corroborate (), contradict (), query (), make clear (), refute () and
demonstrate (). In other words, these imply actions to consider, support, question or verify suggestions and/or
information resources for supporting decision making.

5. Modes of Context-Aware Decision Support in Collaborative E-work
The aim of our proposed framework, presented in sections 3 and 4 above, is to enable context-aware decision
support in collaborative e-work. We identify three modes of context-aware decision support in collaborative e-work.
These are depicted in figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the three modes within the system architecture of our
proposed framework, while figure 4 shows their detailed implementations. We describe how the incorporation of an
explicit context model as depicted in figure 1 will support these three modes of context-aware decision making.
The system supports reactive, collaborative and proactive decision processes. These three modes of decision
support are based on preliminary findings of how decisions are made in real world collaborative e-work in the ehealth domain. In reactive mode, a user (e.g. a physician) sends a query to the system. The system determines
context of work based on two key parameters – activity and users. The system passes control to a search engine,
which, in our implementation, is an extended version of the generic search engine that enables context-based search.
Retrieved information is analysed to further determine its relevance to the original query. The result of the process is
displayed back to the user. If the result is acceptable to the user, it is automatically applied to decision making,
otherwise the query is reformulated and re-sent (see figure 4a). The process is the same for collaborative decision
support (see figure 4b), except that the result is broadcast to all users, who then engage in a brainstorming session to
negotiate whether the result is acceptable or not. Our design enables the system to act as a participant in this
brainstorming session and to contribute to decision making using the technique of Suggestion Augmentation and
ContextMorph [16], i.e. by using results of the information analysis module to enrich suggestions. As result, if a
user suggests a hypothesis, the system can check it and even suggest extensions by automatically starting threads of
the process in proactive decision support mode. In proactive decision support (see figure 4c), the processes of
context-aware information search and analysis are triggered by events in the application, such as during a
brainstorming session or by changes in a patient’s condition, e.g. in an e-health application.

The reactive decision support mode is user-driven, bidirectional (man-machine) and synchronous. The
collaborative mode is user-driven, multi-directional (man-machine and man-man) and supports both synchronous
and asynchronous modes of communication. The last mode, the proactive mode, is event-driven and multidirectional (man-machine and man-man) and supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes of
communication and anytime anywhere communication through the use of alerts.
6. Integrating Knowledge for Decision Support in Collaborative E-Work
Over the years, two key trends have emerged towards providing knowledge-based support in decision making.
The first is based on the assumption that reasoning will be computerised and automated. The realisation of this
approach requires a formal knowledge representation language capable of replicating the human-level ability to
execute tasks and generate new information using existing information [2]. The second approach is semi-automated,
and requires that relevant knowledge be presented to human decision makers with explanations for their use [31].
The later approach, which requires less knowledge representation formalisms, but more formal verification and
knowledge integration bottlenecks, is the path taken in this research work.
In collaborative e-work, the process of knowledge integration poses an added challenge since a piece of
information may be applied differently by different experts from different organisations to achieve the same
purpose. Our focus is to identify the point at which an expert or a group of experts intuitively integrates available
(explicit) knowledge – from the information set (see section 3) with their tacit knowledge when reasoning towards a
problem solving situation or a decision making process. What are the choices made within a prevailing decision
making context, and why? We identify two primary approaches that drive this knowledge integration process:
• Explicit rule-based integration: Here, the decision maker follows explicit guidelines and procedures, often,
written in textbooks and documented in form of theories, policies and principles.
• Practice-based integration: Here, the decision maker abides by a number of context variables or situational
constraints in his work environment, and carries out any reasoning or knowledge integration using experience,
expertise and intuition, rather than (entirely) explicit guidelines.

Fig. 4. Implementations of the three modes of decision support

Figure 5 depicts a decision support model in collaborative e-work. The context model detects (or perceives)
patterns in the decision making process through a mechanism which we refer to as percepts. Such patterns include
activities and problem solving tasks as well as domain models – concepts, facts and heuristics. The model retrieves
appropriate knowledge resources from the system knowledge base, which are used to support decision making in the
form of knowledge-oriented actions. The knowledge base is populated with results obtained from processes in figure
4. Ontology-based meta-data models are applied in representing knowledge in the knowledge base. An ontology
includes a vocabulary of terms, and some specification of their meaning as well as definitions and an indication of
how concepts are inter-related which collectively impose a structure on the domain and constrain the possible

interpretations of terms [32]. In our current implementation, actions are semi-automated since users are responsible
for taking the ultimate decision. A major challenge is to fully automate the process. In this implementation, which
focuses on breast diagnosis and treatment by a team of physicians working across border, four ontology types are
identified: domain-oriented ontology, task-oriented ontology, generic ontology and practice-specific ontology.
Relations, such as IsAssociatedWith, IsASymptonOf, etc., are used to link concepts and entities, e.g. a lump in the
breast IsASymptonOf of breast cancer.

7. Discussion and Conclusion
Traditional decision making techniques often involve approaches that build on a probabilistic view of
uncertainty, where possible actions are evaluated through their expected utility [22, 23]. Everyday work practices,
however, show that decision making tasks involve the application of commonsense knowledge, experience and
reasoning (tacit knowledge) to available information (explicit knowledge) while putting into consideration
contextual constraints in an individual’s work setting (depicted in the activity landscape). Our proposed context
model focuses on depicting this point of knowledge integration during decision making in an open and crossboundary collaborative work environment. The goal is to enable a clearer understanding of the way experts integrate
knowledge during problem solving, so as to provide common grounds for decision making and knowledge sharing
in a way that will allow effective computer-based support to e-collaborative decision making.
However, specifying a structure for knowledge representation in this setting remains hugely problematic. Any
system application of knowledge must specify clearly how knowledge is to be represented. Knowledge
representation is a persistent problem in knowledge engineering [1, 31]. The concept of knowledge suffers from a
high degree of what might be called “terminological ambiguity” and often requires many adjectives to clarify the
sense in which it is being used [2]. This becomes more tasking when varying contexts in a collaborative work setting
are to be represented. In collaborative e-work, a clear definition of knowledge and an identification of operational
knowledge types should serve as the basis for any acceptable method of knowledge representation, and will have to
be formal and less organisation-specific, but sufficiently activity-oriented and context-aware.
Our on-going and future work focuses on an implementation of the proposed model in the area of breast cancer
diagnosis and treatment in an e-health environment. It is based on a context-based reasoning mechanism that allows
disparate decision makers to incorporate accumulated tacit knowledge and existing context information into the
system’s recommended (explicit) knowledge services in order to support effective and efficient collaborative
decision making.
