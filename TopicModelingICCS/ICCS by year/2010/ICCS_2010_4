1. Introduction
Optimization problems are often found both in academic research and application technology. In modern system,
the bulk becomes larger, the structure becomes more complex, and the constraint becomes more excessive, the
nonlinearity becomes stronger, those intrinsic factors such as inaccuracy in measurements, indeterminacy in
dynamics become more severe inevitably, accompanied with rapid progress in science and technology. A mass of
problems present in these systems that could not be solved by classical optimization methods. Therefore, the
research on novel optimization algorithms is always an important work in relative field.
All kinds of complex systems in nature and society, such as ecosystem, economic system, social system, etc, are
formed after a long time development, their current structures or states are natural results that adapt external
conditions. TKHLU GHYHORSLQJ SURFHGXUHV DUH RSWLPL]DWLRQ SURFHGXUHV HVVHQWLDOO\ +HJHO¶V IDPRXV SURSRVLWLRQ ³:KDWLVUDWLRQDOLVUHDOZKDWLVUHDOLVUDWLRQDO´LVWKHH[actest declaration to the law and phenomena. Nature and

society, for example bionics by simulating biologic behavior, artificial nerve referring to information processing
mechanism of cerebrum, fuzzy system following human thinking method.
People had presented several modern optimization algorithms by simulating nature and human society, this kind
of optimization algorithms were called heuristic optimization algorithms which have behaved excellent local and
global search ability, such as Genetic algorithm (GA) inspired by biological evolution[1], Simulated Annealing (SA)
algorithm that mimics the natural process of the slow cooling of liquids, which leads to a solid that has the lowest
energy[2], Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm mimicking ant colony behavior that ants accumulate
experiences to determine the shortest path to destination[3], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm inspired
by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling when looking for food[4], Tabu Search Optimization (TSO)
algorithm modeling memory characteristics of intelligent organisms [5] and so on. Heuristic optimization algorithms
are computational approaches that could refer to field-specific knowledge and expertise to converge at optimal
solutions efficiently. Heuristic optimization algorithms must have the capability for some given optimization
problems that the local optimal solutions are explored in-depth, regardless of how much complicated the problem
may be, that the global optimal solutions are find out overall, regardless of how many local optima there may exist.
Comparing with traditional optimization algorithms, heuristic optimization algorithms have represented
distinguished advantage in solving N-P (Non-deterministic Polynomial) problems which is difficult to work out by
traditional optimization algorithms.
The No-free-lunch (NFL) theorem proves that the performance of all optimization algorithms is equivalent
averagely for entire problem-field. If algorithm A outperforms algorithm B on a problem set, there must exist
exactly another problem set where algorithm B outperforms algorithm A. Any two optimization algorithms are
equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems. Therefore the evaluation about an
algorithm depends greatly on the problem that wants to solve. NFL theorem indicates actually that seeking a
universal algorithm for all optimization problems is impossible, and it means also that an optimization algorithm
will be specialized to some optimization problems better than others. Therefore, it can be said that developing new
optimization algorithms ceaselessly is always necessary and significant.
Election is an important political activity in human society, sample surveys are employed widely to forecast the
election results. A sample survey is a statistical method that gathers fractional information from a number of
individuals, namely a sample, to learn some conclusion about whole population. The U.S. presidential election is
one of the largest elections in the world. For example in the 2004, there are more than 250 million valid voters in
The U.S. at that time, in the end about 120 million voters go to poll. The amount of voters is a considerably bulky
number, but the election results could be forecasted long before election voting within some margin of sampling
error based on a survey-sample, which may only include a few ten thousand, or a few thousand individuals.
In election campaign, election candidates always pursue the maximum support from voters by means of various
election actions. Election candidates find out their current supports according to the sample to voters, and then
decide how to do in the next. In order to obtain the more and more supports form voters, election candidates will
always tend towards those voters with the higher prestige. Election is a process that candidates seed the maximum
support from voters, optimization is a technique is that find the best solution in field of problem, it is can be found
that there are considerable comparability between election campaign and optimization problem. It can be imagined
that there must be an optimization mechanism contained in election campaign, which can be learned to develop a
new optimization algorithm. In this paper, an optimization algorithm simulating election campaign is developed, by
the way it is named Election Campaign Optimization (ECO) algorithm.
2. ECO algorithm
Let us imagine that there is a kind of election mechanism in a country, a few election candidates with some
prestige are permitted to participate in election among voters, and they obtain supports from those voters affected by
them, and finally win the highest supports from voters. The prestige of candidates is different each other. A
FDQGLGDWH¶s effect to voters is in direct proportion to his prestige. A candidate can affect many voters, and his effect
decreases gradually with the increase of distance between the candidate and voters. The prestige of voters is
different each other also. A YRWHU¶V support to candidates is in direct proportion to his prestige. Each voter would be
affected by several candidates, so the voter should distribute his support to the all candidates that had affected him
according to the effect magnitude from those candidates. Each candidate can affect many voters, so he will receive

the support from those voters, the total support the candidate holds is the sum of the support from all voters he had
affected. The current support situation of candidates is achieved by means of sample survey to voters. In order to
insure that the sample survey is precise and general, the local survey sample about each candidate is generated by
the probability of normal distribution around each candidate, the global survey sample about all candidates is
generated by the probability of uniform distribution in the total field. The contribution of a sample-survey voter to a
candidate is the proportion of the sample-VXUYH\YRWHU¶s support to the total support of that candidate. The location
coordinates of the sample-survey voters are multiplied by corresponding contributions to a candidate, and then sum
them together, a weighted location coordinate is determined, which is the support barycenter of the candidate, which
is the place where the candidate will be of the high prestige after this cycle sample-survey.
If the candidates are compared to ships and voters to waters in the above election mechanism, the ships continue
to adjust their positions according to sample-survey results in order to gain the higher water surface. It can be found
that the effects of a candidate to the sample-survey voters at different distance is various, the supports that samplesurvey voters with various prestige can distribute is different also. Therefore the contributions from a same batch of
sample-survey voters to various candidates are different, and can generate the different support barycenters for each
candidate, which will lead candidates to the most suitable position for themselves. Such kind of election will tend to
guide candidates to the voter that is of the nearer position and the higher prestige, in order to arrive at a position
owning higher prestige consequentially.
Election is a process that candidates seek maximum support from voters by a series of campaign, and
optimization is to find the best in numerous feasible solutions; they are similar to some degree. It can be imagined
that there is an optimization mechanism in the election process that can be simulated to establish a new optimization
algorithm. This algorithm is named Election Campaign Optimization (ECO) algorithm.
In ECO algorithm, solution space is imagined as an assembly of all voters, current feasible solutions are imagined
as candidates. The function value of a candidate is defined as the prestige of the candidate that of a voter in is
defined as the prestige of the voter.

In the following, the search mechanism of ECO algorithm is illustrated within a computing cycle. 3 candidates
are employed in the illustration, which are denoted as Ci ( i 1, 2,3 ), and are marked with crosses in Fig.1., their
location coordinate are xC ( i 1, 2,3 ). 10 global sample-survey voters are employed in the illustration, which are

denoted as V j ( j 1, 2, ,10 ), and are marked with filled cycles in Fig.1., their location coordinate are
xV ( j 1, 2, ,10 ). 4 local sample-survey voters are employed around each candidate in illustration, which are

xV ( i 1, 2,3; j 1, 2,3, 4 ).
i, j
Here, single subscript j in sample-survey voters indicates that they are global sample-survey voters. Couple
subscript i, j divided by comma indicates that they are local sample-survey voters, and the first number indicates
that the voter is around the ith candidate, the second number is the serial number of the local voter.
Firstly, compute the prestige of candidates. The function value of a current solution, namely a candidate, is the
prestige of the current candidate, so the prestige of candidates can be obtained by computing the function value of
objective function

PCi

 

f xCi

Where PCi represents the prestige of candidate Ci , f   is the objective function,

xCi is the location coordinate of

candidate Ci ( i 1, 2,3 ).
Secondly, compute the effect ranges of candidates. The higher prestige a candidate is, the larger cover range the
candidate has. As the effect range exceeds a limit distance, the effect of the candidate to voters reduces to zero. So
the following law is used to describe the relation of the effect and the effect range of a candidate.
PCi  PMin
RCi
 RMax  RMin   RMin
PMax  PMin
Where RCi represents the cover ranges of candidate Ci ˗ RMax and RMin are the maximum and minimum cover
ranges of candidates, they are the parameters of ECO algorithm, which need to set before computing˗ PMax and PMin
are the maximum and minimum prestige of current candidates. In this illustration shown in Fig.1.,

Min PC1 , PC2 , PC3 , RMax and RMin can be same, namely fixed effect range for all

candidate is applied.
Then, compute the mean square deviation of local sample-survey. The higher prestige a candidate is, the smaller
the mean square deviation the candidate has, so that the ECO algorithm is able to converge to local best solution
rapidly and steadily. The following law is used to describe the relation of the prestige and a local sample-survey
mean square deviation of a candidate.

Where V Ci represents the local sample-survey mean square deviation of candidate Ci ˗ V Max and V Min are the
maximum and minimum local sample-survey mean square deviation of candidates, they are the parameters of ECO
algorithm, which need to set before computing˗ V Max and V Min can be same, namely fixed local sample-survey
mean square deviation of candidate is applied.
Generate the global sample-survey voters. The uniform distribution is employed to generate the global samplesurvey voters in solution field. The uniform distribution is denoted as u  xMin , xMax  , and its probability density
function is:
1

Where Min and Max are lower limit and upper limit of feasible solutions field respectively. The uniform distribution
can be generated by the following Matlab language code:
u rand ;% generating random numbers obeying uniform distribution in [0, 1] interval
z xMin  u  xMax  xMin  ;% mapping random numbers to[ xMin , xMax ] interval
Then the global sample-survey voters are generated V1g , V2g , «, V10g .
Generate the local sample-survey voters. Local sample-survey voters are generated around each candidate on the
normal distribution. The local sample-survey voters are generated by

Compute the distance between of candidates and sample-survey voters. Different definition of distance can be
used here, for example

xC2i  xV2j

DCiV j

Where DCiV j is the distance between candidate Ci and sample-survey voter V j , V j is any one from all samplesurvey voters including the local and the global sample-survey voters, for example the distance between candidate
C1 and the global sample-survey voter V3 is DC1V3 , the distance between candidate C1 and the local sample-survey
voter V1,2 is DC1V1,2 . Then the distances between all candidate and all voters are generated.

Each sample-survey voter may be affected by several candidates, such as the global sample-survey voter V6 , V9

Where FVi represents the total effect of voter Vi . For example, the sample-survey voter V6 is affected by candidates

C1 , C3 the total effect of V6 is FC1V6  FC3V6 . So the total effect of all sample-survey voters can be determined.
Compute the prestige of voters. The prestige of a voter is obtained by means of objective function
PV j f xV j

 

Where PV j represents the prestige of voter V j , f   is the objective function also. So the prestige of all samplesurvey voters can be determined.
Compute the support of voters. The support of a voter is proportional to his prestige, and then the proportional
constant can be reduced, so the prestige of a voter can used to denote the support of a voter directly. A samplesurvey voter may be affected by several candidates; the voter should distribute his support to those candidates that
had affected him proportionally on the effect magnitude the voter received. The support from the sample-survey
voter Vi to the candidate C j is

Similarly, the supports of other sample-survey voter are distributed to candidates.
Compute the total supports of candidates. A candidate might be supported by several sample-survey voters, so
the total support of a candidate obtained is

Where SCi represents the total support of candidate Ci from voters. For example, candidate C1 is supported by the
global sample-survey voters V5 , V6 , V8 , V9 , and the local sample-survey voters V1,1 , V1,2 , V1,3 , V1,4 , V3,1 ,, V3,4 the

Similarly, the other support of candidates could be obtained.
Compute the contribution from sample-survey voters to candidates. The contribution from a sample-survey voter
to a candidate is the proportion of the support from the sample-survey voter in the total support of the candidate.

SC1
Similarly, the contribution from all sample-survey voters to all candidates could be obtained.
Compute the support barycenter of the candidates. The contribution from a sample-survey voter to a candidate is
a power which will lead the candidate to the orientation of that sample-survey voter. A new position coordinate will
achieve by means of summing the products of the contribution from the sample-survey voters to the candidate and
the position coordinate of the sample-survey voters. It is named the support barycenter of the candidate by samplesurveying.
xCmi ¦ QV j Ci xV j
Where xCmi is the support barycenter of the candidate Ci by a sample-survey. For example the support barycenter of
the candidate C1 is
xCm1

QV5 C1 xV5  QV6 C1 xV6  QV8 C1 xV8  QV9 C1 xV9

QV1,1C1 xV1,1  QV1,2C1 xV1,2  QV1,3C1 xV1,3  QV1,4C1 xV1,4  QV3,1C1 xV3,1  QV3,4C1 xV3,4 Ǆ
The support barycenter of a candidate is obtained by means of sample-surveying, which depends on the positions
of those sample-surveying voters whose distances to the candidate are nearer and prestiges are higher relatively. The
next election location of the candidate should be his support barycenter, where the candidate will have the higher
support. Do that circularly until the highest support is found.
In order to jump out of local optimization solution and increase search efficiency, the prestige of candidates are
compared to that of sample-survey voters, if the prestige of a sample-surveying voter is higher than that of a
candidate, the sample-survey voter with higher prestige will substitute for the candidate and that candidate with
lower prestige will be eliminated in election.
ECO algorithm toolbox is realized by means of MATLAB language. The toolbox contains ECO algorithm main
program, input program, output program, help files. ECO algorithm main program implements the operation of ECO

4. Conclusions
This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm - Election Campaign Optimization algorithm, in which
solution space is imagined as an assembly of all voters, current feasible solutions are imagined as candidates. To
pursue higher support will guide candidates to the positions with the higher prestige, namely the support barycenter
which is obtained by means of sample-surveying. Repeat the process circularly until the positions with the highest
support is found, it is the optimal solutions of the optimization problem. The ECO algorithm toolbox in Matlab is
developed, in which some common function are collected. In this paper, only 3 optimization functions and a
problem of tuning parameters of PID controller are verified as example. The results show that ECO algorithm can be
used to search out the optimal solutions of optimization problems. As indicated in NFL theorem that an optimization
algorithm will be specialized to some optimization problems better than others. There may be some optimization
problems suitable for ECO algorithm best, let us find them out.
