Abstract
In this paper we propose a new computationally efficient algorithm for automatic estimation of intima and media boundary of
common carotid artery (CCA) based on ultrasound (USG) image analysis. The intima-media thickness (IMT), equal to distance
between intima and media boundary, is typically used to predict cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and stroke. At
present, it is measured by a physician making manual segmentation of an USG image. Automatic estimation of IMT, freeing
physicians from this tedious work, should speed the process and assure higher reproducibility. The proposed algorithm involves
USG image denoising by means of a nonlinear diffusion filter working in semi-explicit scheme and iterative image segmentation
by a modified active contour method with suitable energy function.

1.Introduction
Data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that cardiovascular system diseases are
responsible for over 7 million premature demises in the world per year. One of the main factors of cardiovascular
risk is hypertension leading to arterial vessels rebuilding. It was found in clinical research that hypertension causes
thickening and remodeling of intima-media complex (IMC). Therefore measurement of intima-media thickness
(IMT) of the common carotid artery in ultrasound B mode examination (see Fig. 1) is recognized as an effective
noninvasive method of state valuation of arterial vessels and cardiovascular risk [1].
Due to subtlety of the IMC rebuilding process, presence of strong disturbances in ultrasound images (speckles,
specular reflections, echoes, shadows, Gaussian noise of electronics) and low contrast in case of fine structures, e.g.
lumen-intima transition, IMT measurement is a difficult time-consuming task. Estimation of IMC thickness
progression in time is an additional challenge due to the fact that the IMT measurement error is very high as a result
of significant distinctions in subjective IMT evaluation by different physicians.

INTIMA

Fig. 1. Fragment of USG B mode image showing intima-media complex (IMC) of the common carotid artery

In this context, development of an automatic and robust IMT estimation method performed in real-time is very
important [2]. Taking into account features of the USG data source, such a method has to consist of:
• initial filtration aiming at reduction of disturbances and edge enhancement,
• initial image segmentation aiming at approximate calculation of boundaries of intima and adventitia,
• iterated improvement of the first solution, e.g. by using the active contours method (so-called snake).
In the method proposed in this paper the non-linear image filtration was realized by means of modified speckle
reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) algorithm [3, 4] for which a new efficient discretization scheme was
proposed. For approximate estimation of intima and adventitia position the algorithm described in [2] has been
exploited but in contrast to [2], the localization of these two layers has been done more precisely by means of the
modified active contour method [5] instead of the standard one. The proposed method has been initially tested and
validated on artificial USG-like images obtained from software generator proposed in [6].
2.Initial filtration of USG image
2.1 Mathematical model of noise in USG image
Multiplicative noise is the dominating noise in USG images. Hence, the luminance of USG pixels is usually
described using the following model:

g (i , j ) = u (i , j ) f (i , j )

(1)

where u(i, j) and f(i, j) represent noise and signal samples, respectively, for image coordinates (i, j). Furthermore it is
assumed that values of u(i, j) and f(i, j) can be modeled by statistically-independent random variables, i.e.

E [u (i , j ) f (i , j )] = E [u (i , j )] E [ f (i , j )]

(2)

and the noise u(i, j) is wide-sense stationary [8], i.e. its mean value and variance are [7]:

E[u (i , j )] = u , E[(u (i, j ) − u ) 2 ] = σ u2

(3)

In above eqations E[.] denotes the expectation operator.
2.2. Adaptive USG image de-noising
Adaptive filtration of USG signal g(i, j) addresses removing the multiplicative noise u(i, j) from it. It was shown
in [7] that such filtering can be realized when equation (1) is re-written into the form signal + noise:

g (i , j ) = f (i , j ) + [u (i , j ) − 1] f (i , j ) ,

(4)

where

n (i , j ) = [u (i , j ) − 1] f (i , j )
represents additive noise depending on signal f(i, j). Next, the luminance of each image pixel is modeled as
fˆ = a g + a ,
1

0

where a0 represents local mean luminance of the image and a1 is its local deviation from it (pixel's indexes have
been omitted for brevity). Values of coefficients {a0, a1} are chosen to minimize the cost function:
B ( fˆ ) = E [( f − fˆ ) 2 ] ,
mse

which leads to the following two equations [8]

a0 = f − a1 g , σ 2f u = a1σ g2
and finally

σ 2f u
fˆ = f + 2 (g − g ) .
σg

(6)

Practical application of the above filter requires estimation of the ratio between variances of the original (σf2) and
the observed noisy signal (σg2). After 1) using variance definition, and 2) exploiting the assumed statistical
independence of signal f(.) and noise u(.) (2), one gets

σ g2 = E [( g − g ) 2 ] = E[( fu − f u ) 2 ] = E[ f 2 ]E [u 2 ] − f 2 u 2

→ E [ f 2 ] = (σ g2 + f 2 u 2 ) / E[u 2 ]

and (since E[u 2 ] = σ u2 + u 2 ):

fˆ = ⎢ g +

⎥⎦

(7)

The value of Cu2 is constant, due to the noise stationarity assumption (3), and can be estimated on a smooth fragment
(i.e. without edges) of the USG image. In turn, the value Cg2 represents normalized local variance of the signal and
is estimated using a small neighborhood of the currently processed pixel (usually 4 neighboring pixels). When the
current pixel has neighborhood without edges, the ratio Cu2/Cg2 is close to 1 and the pixel is replaced by the local
mean value which causes noise reduction. In case of edge occurrence, averaging operation has a smaller weight
which prevents smoothing and shifting edges existing in the original image.
2.3 USG image de-noising based on nonlinear diffusion process
It has been observed in [3] that the factor ( g − g ) in (7) can be reassembled to discrete Laplacian after
approximation of g by averaging 4 neighboring pixels

4( g - g ) i , j = ( 4 g i, j − [ g i+1, j + g i −1, j + g i, j+1 + g i, j −1 ]) = − ( Δg ) i, j .
This observation is a basis for definition of a new filter type. It was derived in [3] by iterative application of (7) to
the image I t according to the equation

I t+Δt = I t +

Δt
div[(1 − k t ) ⋅ ∇I t ]
4

(8)

where I t+ Δt is estimated value, i.e. corresponds to fˆ in (7), and I t plays a role of g in (7), ∇ denotes an image
gradient and a factor 1-kt is defined as [9]

(9)

The factor u is neglected since it is constant and hence does not influence the edge detection process. The partial
differential equation which corresponds to (8) is

∂I
= div[κ ⋅ ∇I ] ,
∂t

I (t = 0 ) = I 0

(10)

where I0 is an initial image to be denoised and κ = 1 − k . Equation (10) has the same form as the well known
Perona-Malik filter [10]

∂I
= div[c (|∇I |) ⋅ ∇I ]
∂t

(11)

and thus has the similar property. Equation (11) is very popular because its solution computed in time t for
c (|∇I |) = 1 is equal to convolution

I ( x, y, t ) = I 0 ( x, y ) ∗ g ( x, y, t ) ,
of initial image I0(x, y) with 2-D Gaussian function

g (x, y, σ ) =

x2 + y2
exp( −
)

2πσ
2σ 2

having variance 2t . Argument x of the coefficient c(x) in (11) is magnitude of image gradient which is also the
edge estimator. If c (| ∇I |) ≈ 0 then equation (11) represents all-pass filter that preserves edges. In turn, c (| ∇I |) ≈ 1
leads to isotropic smoothing by means of 2-D Gaussian window. Therefore, exchanging c(x) in (11) for κ = 1 − k in
(10) leads to iterative anisotropic filter allowing reduction of multiplicative noise by intra-region smoothing which
in turn leads to preservation and enhancement of the edges (i.e. regions’ boundaries). In Fig. 2 there are presented
effects of modified speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) filter [3, 4] application to two USG images of
common carotid arteries (together with computed positions of intima and media layers).

2.3.1 Efficient numerical implementation
Numerical implementation of (10) requires discretization. Two computational schemes are possible: explicit and
implicit. The explicit scheme is the most straightforward but in order to assure its numerical stability [3] time step
size should be chosen quite small (less than 0.25 [3]). Using first forward and next backward differences denoted as

δ x+ I i, j = I i+1, j − I i, j , δ x− I i, j = I i, j − I i −1, j
one can discretize the right side of equation (10) as

div( κ∇I ) i , j ≈ δ x− ( κ i, j δ x+ I i, j ) + δ y− ( κ i, j δ y+ I i, j ) ,
div( κ ∇ I ) i , j ≈ κ i, j ( I i+1, j − I i, j ) + κ i −1, j ( I i −1, j − I i, j ) + κ i, j ( I i, j+1 − I i, j ) + κ i, j −1 ( I i, j −1 − I i, j )
which leads to the explicit scheme having the following form

[

I i,t+j Δt = I i,t j + Δt κ it, j ( I it+1, j − I it, j ) + κ it−1, j ( I it−1, j − I it, j ) + κ it, j ( I it, j +1 − I it, j ) + κ it, j −1 ( I it, j −1 − I it, j )

]

(12)

where η(i, j) denotes the set of coordinates which are neighborhoods of point (i, j).
The other, so called semi-implicit scheme based on (13a) is unconditionally stable [11]. We chose the Jacobi
approach proposed in [11]. However, in our implementation, instead of central differences used in [11] we applied
the mixed image differences (between iterations t and t+Δt) to obtain additional computational speed-up
t

div( κ∇ I ) i , j ≈ κ i,t j ( I it+1, j − I i,t+j Δt ) + κ it−1, j ( I it−1, j − I i,t+j Δt ) + κ i,t j ( I i,t j+1 − I i,t+j Δt ) + κ i,t j −1 ( I i,t j −1 − I i,t+j Δt )

(13a)

The final formula is

I i,t+j Δt =

[

I i,t j + Δt κ it, j I it+1, j + κ it−1, j I it−1, j + κ it, j I it, j +1 + κ it, j −1 I it, j −1
1 + Δt [ κ

]

(13b)

The computational complexity of one time step in the semi-implicit scheme (13b) is almost the same as in (12) but in
this case Δt can be 10 (and more) times larger which results in 10 times lower number of iterations. This is
especially important in processing large images for which not only a large amount of pure arithmetic operations is
required but also immense time-consuming memory access.
3. Intima and media boundary detection
After applying the proposed above fast SRAD filter implementation and speckle reduction in USG image, the
intima and adventitia boundary can be estimated. The proposed algorithm involves steps presented below.
3.1 Intima layer search step
Lumen - intima boundary is characterized by relatively high contrast (see Fig. 1) therefore it can be easily
detected using simple iterative scheme based on image thresholding together with a continuity constraint for the
intima line. For the initial estimation of intima boundary we are using simple algorithm similar to the one proposed
in [2]. It works as follows. The intima boundary is represented by N points:

p1 ( x1 , y1 ) ,..., p N ( x N , y N )
which in the beginning are placed at the upper edge of region of interest (ROI) specified by a physician. There is
another vector informing if the corresponding point pi ( xi , y i ) can be moved down or it is already frozen and
should not be moved. The intima layer search algorithm consists of the followings steps:

we can take Tg = 0.8 × z ( N × M − 4 N )

3.2 Intima layer refinement step
Since USG images are heavily corrupted by noise, the simple intima layer search algorithm presented above is
not sufficient (i.e. fails) for some images (see Fig. 3). Therefore, to fix the problem, we propose an additional, intima
layer refinement step based on modified active contour algorithm [5].
The active contour [5] is a parametric curve v(s)=[x(s), y(s)], s ∈ [0,1] that moves through image plane and tries
to minimize the energy functional

E snake = F (v ( s ) , v s ( s ) , v ss ( s ) )ds

)

vs(s) and vss(s) denote the first and the second derivative of v(s) in respect to s, respectively, α, β are coefficients
weighting the curve internal energy and Eimg is a suitable energy function. From calculus of variations it is known
that curve minimizing (14) must satisfy the Euler equation [5]

It provides necessary but not sufficient condition for extrema of the functional (14)

∇Eimg (v( s )) − αv ss ( s ) + βv ssss ( s ) = 0

(15)

Practical way of solving the above equation is to assume that the curve v(s) is a time-dependent function, e.g. v(s, t),
place the initial curve v(s, t=0) in a close proximity to the optimal one v*(s) and to move it iteratively. At some
distance from the optimal curve v*(s) the equation (14) should be written as

vt ( s, t ) = αv ss ( s , t ) − βv ssss ( s, t ) − ∇Eimg (v ( s , t ))
After some iterations vt (s,t) vanishes and the curve v(s, τ) is equal to the optimal one v*(s).
The method requires discretization of the curve vi = ( x (i ), y (i )) for i = 0,..., N. After applying Euler backward
scheme one gets [12]

vi, j+1 − vi, j
Δt

= α (vi+1, j+1 − 2vi, j+1 + vi −1, j+1 ) − β (vi+2, j+1 − 4vi+1, j+1 + 6vi, j+1 − 4vi−1, j+1 + vi− 2, j+1 )

(16)

− ( f x ( j ) , f y ( j ))
where

f x (i ) = ∂Eimg / ∂xi ,

f y (i ) = ∂Eimg / ∂yi .

To be solvable for nodes v0,…vN, the above equation requires specification of appropriate boundary condition. In
traditional application the snake is a closed curve so the boundary condition is circular-like: v-1 = vN-1 and v-2 = vN-2.
In our method, however, the contour is open, so we propose symmetric-like boundary condition:

v−2 = v1 , v−1 = v0

and

v N +1 = v N , v N +2 = v N −1

In our method the contour can move only in Y direction, no move along X axis is allowed. In such a case equation
(16) reduces to y component only and resulting snake evolution equation can be written as

3.3 Adventitia layer search step
In the first step of adventitia layer search process, curve representing lumen-intima boundary (see Fig. 4) is
moved behind intima layer to reduce wrong influence of intima detection upon adventitia layer search process. The
lumen-intima boundary is characterized by high, positive value of y image gradient component. In turn, the intimamedia boundary is characterized by high value of y image gradient component with opposite sign. Therefore to
move boundary away from the estimated already lumen-intima to the neighborhood of the searched intima-media it
is enough to advance it as long as magnitude of y component of image gradient is descending with continuity
constraint for the boundary line. This can be done for example with the help of active contour method described in
the section 3.2, now with Eimg having the opposite sign. To prevent contour from going back (up) image part above
the intima boundary line should be set to value large enough. The resulting line is presented in Fig. 5. In this figure
we can observe that boundary line is placed between two edges: lumen-intima and media-adventitia.

Next, before media-adventitia boundary estimation step, the lumen-intima edge indicator Eimg (image part above
green line in Fig. 5) should be removed in order to eliminate its wrong influence to media-adventitia estimation
process. For media-adventitia search we apply the same algorithm as was used in refinement step of lumen-media
estimation. Resulting boundary lines: lumen-intima and media-adventitia are presented in Fig. 6.

4.Results
The proposed above automatic intima-media thickness (IMT) estimation algorithm has been implemented in
Matlab programming environment and tested. Weights α, β determining the snake (16) behavior have been set to 1
and 0.1, respectively. For tests two images have been used. The first synthetic one (see Fig. 7) was generated by
means of random walk algorithm proposed in [6] with the following values of parameters: image having 256x256
pixels with luminance normalized in the range [0, 1], m=128 arcs with n=64 points each, M(x, y) - number of
random walk steps - taken from the interval [1, 20], variance of a phaser magnitude σ2 = 0.1/256, the scanning
angle Θ=π/3, origin height (offset) y0=16 pixels. The second real image was chosen from the set of images obtained
from Clinic of Geriatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. During the tests the
incoming images have been denoised using two versions of the algorithm (10): the standard one (12) with 30
iterations and step size Δt = 0.15, and the fast one (13) with 5 iterations and step size Δt = 1.2. Next intima layer
search step has been performed with and without optional down-sampling.
To evaluate and compare performance of various versions of the algorithm two measures have been applied. The
first one was the Pratt's figure of merit (FOM) defined as [13]

FOM =

∑ 1+ d

where N is a number of edge pixels in the test image and di denotes the Euclidean distance between the ith detected
and the nearest reference edge pixel. For real USG images the ideal edge pixels are unavailable, therefore as a
reference edge the edge derived from non down-sampling explicit version of the algorithm was used. Therefore in
Table 1 there is “-” in the first row in the FOM column. For both images the minimum, maximum and the mean
values of intima-media thickness have been calculated. The results are presented in Table 1.

We can observe in Table 1 that the fast semi-implicit method is only a slightly worse than the slow explicite one.
Additionally, image down-sampling does not decrease accuracy of both methods.
For visual inspection, results of each calculation step can be observed in figures from 2 to 6, while in Fig. 6 one
can see the final result - estimated boundaries of lumen-intima and media-adventitia. It is worth to mention that the
method does not depend on parameters of USG instrumentation due to the fact that noise coefficient Cu2 is directly
computed (estimated) from a smooth fragment (i.e. without edges) of the USG image to be denoised.
5.Conclusions
New computationally efficient algorithm for automatic estimation of intima-media and media-adventitia layers
based on USG images of common carotid artery has been proposed and described in the paper. The method makes
use of well-known partial solutions (modules) that were put to work together. Nevertheless three original ideas have
been introduced with respect to the well-known methods. First, using mixed instead of direct central differences in
(13) caused significant speed-up of the speckle-reduction anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) filter implementation –
required number of iterations has been reduced 10 times. Second, the two-fold down-sampling has been introduced
as a preprocessing step in intima layer search algorithm to reduce processing times. Finally, the novel symmetric
like boundary condition has been used in the applied active contour algorithm allowing its usage for curve not
contour detection. Additionally, with respect to our previous publication [14], computationally efficient SRAD
implementation and testing algorithms on artificial reference USG-like images are added.
