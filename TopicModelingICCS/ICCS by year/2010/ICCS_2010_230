Abstract
We report our preliminary results in developing a new cell-centered control volume Lagrangian scheme for solving
Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in cylindrical coordinates. Based on a local coordinate transform
strategy, the scheme can preserve one-dimensional spherical symmetry in a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry
when computed on an equal-angle-zoned initial grid. Unlike many previous area weighted schemes that possess
the spherical symmetry property, our scheme is discretized on the true volume and it can preserve the conservation
property for all the conserved variables including density, momentum and total energy. Preliminary two dimensional
numerical examples in cylindrical coordinates are presented to demonstrate the performance of the scheme in terms
of symmetry, accuracy and non-oscillatory properties.

1. Introduction
In numerical simulations of multidimensional ﬂuid ﬂow, there are two typical choices: a Lagrangian framework,
in which the mesh moves with the local ﬂuid velocity, and an Eulerian framework, in which the ﬂuid ﬂows through
a grid ﬁxed in space. More generally, the motion of the grid can also be chosen arbitrarily, resulting in the so-called
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method (ALE; see, e.g. [11]).
The Lagrangian method is widely used in many ﬁelds for multi-material ﬂow simulations such as astrophysics and
computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD), due to its distinguished advantage in capturing material interfaces sharply. In
the past years, many eﬀorts have been made to develop Lagrangian methods. Some algorithms are built on a staggered

discretization in which velocity (momentum) is stored at vertices, while density and internal energy are stored at cell
centers. The density / internal energy and velocity are solved on two diﬀerent control volumes, see, e.g. [16, 1, 3].
The dissipation of kinetic energy into internal energy through shock waves is ensured by an artiﬁcial viscosity term
[16, 5, 6]. Other algorithms start from the cell-centered discretization in which density, momentum and energy are
all centered within cells and evolved on the same control volume. Advantages for the cell-centered schemes such as
[9, 15, 13, 7, 8] include that this kind of methods is easy to remap when necessary and it does not require the addition
of an explicit artiﬁcial viscosity for shock capturing. Numerical diﬀusion is added implicitly in the Riemann solution
in a very natural way.
A diﬃcult problem in ﬂow simulation is the exact preservation of a one-dimensional symmetry (for example,
cylindrical or spherical) in a coordinate system distinct from that symmetry. Concerning the critical issue related to
spherical symmetry preservation many works have been done in the framework of staggered-grid hydrodynamics. The
most widely used method that preserves symmetry exactly on an equal-angle-zoned grid is the area-weighted method
[21, 18, 20, 4, 14]. In this approach one uses a Cartesian form of the momentum equation in the cylindrical coordinate
system, hence integration is performed on area rather than on the true volume in cylindrical coordinates. However,
these area-weighted schemes might violate strict momentum and total energy conservation. This shortcoming of the
schemes has been partially corrected in [3] by constructing a compatible area-weighted scheme which can preserve
the conservation of total energy. However it seems that their ﬂaw in the loss of momentum conservation has not
been solved so far. Diﬀerently from the area-weighted scheme, Browne [2] presented a Lagrangian scheme termed
“integrated total average” which is discretized on the true control volume in cylindrical coordinates. The scheme has
been proven to be able to preserve the desired spherical symmetry in the two dimensional cylindrical geometry for
equal-angle zoning. Unfortunately, this scheme also can not keep the momentum and total energy conservation.
In this short paper, we report our preliminary results in proposing and testing a new cell-centered Lagrangian
scheme on quadrilateral grids for solving compressible Euler equations in cylindrical coordinates. The scheme is
based on a genuine volume discretization formulation. It preserves the conservation of mass, momentum and total
energy. By using a local coordinate transform strategy, the scheme can preserve one dimensional spherical symmetry
in a two dimensional cylindrical geometry for equal-angle-zoned initial grids.
An outline of the rest of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the individual steps of the Lagrangian
scheme with the symmetry and conservation properties for Euler equations in cylindrical coordinates. In Section 3,
preliminary numerical examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the new Lagrangian method. In Section
4 we will give concluding remarks. More details not included here will be given in a future full version of this paper.

2.2. The construction of the scheme
Figure 1 indicates the cylindrical geometry (z, r) we are concerned with. The 2D spatial domain Ω is discretized
into M×N computational cells. Figure 1 shows an equal angular grid with logical l-lines radially outward and logical klines in the angular direction. Ik+1/2,l+1/2 is a quadrilateral cell constructed by the four vertices {(zk,l , rk,l ), (zk+1,l , rk+1,l ),
(zk+1,l+1 , rk+1,l+1 ), (zk,l+1 , rk,l+1 )}. S k+1/2,l+1/2 and Vk+1/2,l+1/2 denote the area and volume of the cell Ik+1/2,l+1/2 with
k = 1, . . . , M, l = 1, . . . , N respectively. For a given cell Ik+1/2,l+1/2 , the location of the cell center is denoted by
(zk+1/2,l+1/2 , rk+1/2,l+1/2 ). The ﬂuid velocity (uk,l , vk,l ) is deﬁned at the vertex of the grid.
In this paper, in order to obtain a scheme with both the spherical symmetry and conservation properties in a
2D cylindrical geometry, we will discretize the momentum equation in (2) by ﬁrst transforming the cylindrical (z, r)
coordinates to the local polar coordinates ξ-θ at each cell, where ξ is the radial direction passing through the cell center
and θ is the angular direction which is orthogonal to ξ. To perform this local polar coordinate transformation, in each
cell, the Euler equations in cylindrical coordinates are rewritten in the following form

where n = (nξ , nθ ) is the outward unit normal of the cell boundary ∂Ii+1/2, j+1/2 , θk+1/2,l+1/2 is the angle between the

For the cell-centered scheme, all the variables except velocity are stored at the cell center of Ik+1/2,l+1/2 in the

fˆD , fˆMξ , fˆMθ and fˆE are the numerical ﬂuxes for mass, ξ-momentum, θ-momentum and total energy across the cell
boundary respectively. U± = (ρ± , Mξ± , Mθ± , E ± ) are the values of mass, ξ-momentum, θ-momentum and total energy
at two sides of the cell boundary. U±n = (ρ± , M n± , E ± ), where M n± are the left and right component values of the
momentum which is normal to the cell boundary, i.e. M n± = (Mξ± , Mθ± ) · n.
The ﬁrst step for establishing the scheme is to determine the line integral term on the right side of Eq. (4). Suppose
the cell boundary ∂Ik+1/2,l+1/2 consists of M edges. The line integral concerned with the ﬂux in Eq. (4) is discretized
by the following formula,

where Δlm is the length of the cell edge m. Here F(U

To determine the ﬂuxes Fˆ = ( fˆD , fˆMξ , fˆMθ , fˆE ) at the cell edge, we ﬁrst need to identify the values of the primitive
variables at each side of the edge, that is Um±
n , m = 1, . . . , M. Here we use the information of the left and right cell
average values of the conserved variables to obtain Um±
n , m = 1, . . . , M.
Next, we will compute the ﬂuxes given the primitive states {Um±
n , m = 1, . . . , M} at each side of the cell’s boundary.
Here we use the Dukowicz numerical ﬂux [10] to obtain the values of Un at the cell boundary. Thus by now, we have
ﬁnished the determination of the ﬂux term of Eq. (4).
For the source term in Eq. (4), θc is set to be the θ coordinate of the center of Cell Ik+1/2,l+1/2 in the local ξ-θ
coordinates. pc is deﬁned as follows,

where pk+1/2,l and pk+1/2,l+1 are the values of pressure at Edges 1 and 3 of Cell Ik+1/2,l+1/2 (see Fig. 1) obtained in the
above ﬂux determination procedure.
Based on the above manipulations, the scheme can preserve the conservation for all the conserved variables, since
it is discretized on the true volume and the numerical ﬂux across each cell boundary is single-valued for the update of
its two neighboring cells. Meanwhile, we can also prove that the scheme can keep the spherical symmetry property if
equal-angular polar initial grids are used. The speciﬁc choices in the discretization of the ﬂuxes and source terms in
(4), as outlined above, are responsible for the exact maintenance of spherical symmetry. The proof itself is omitted in
this short paper and will be provided in our upcoming full paper.
The vertex velocity of the mesh is determined in the same way as in [7].

3. Numerical results in the cylindrical coordinates
In this section, we perform some preliminary numerical experiments in two dimensional cylindrical coordinates.
Purely Lagrangian computation and the ideal gas with γ = 5/3 are used in the following tests unless otherwise stated.
Example 1 (The Noh problem in a cylindrical coordinate system [17]).
We test the Noh problem which is a well known test problem widely used to validate Lagrangian scheme in the
regime of strong shock waves. In this test case, the initial state of the ﬂuid is uniform with (ρ, e) = (1, 10−5 ) and an
inward radial velocity of magnitude 1. The equi-angular polar grid is applied in the 14 -circle computational domain
deﬁned in a polar coordinates by [0, 1] × [0, π/2]. The shock is generated in a perfect gas by bringing the cold gas
to rest at a rigid wall (r = 0). The analytical post shock density is 64 and the shock speed is 1/3. Figure 2 shows
the computational grids at the initial and ﬁnal time and the density result at t = 0.6 with 100 × 30 grids. In the
plot of grids, we observe the symmetry is perfectly preserved. In the plot of density result, we observe no spurious
oscillation near the discontinuity region. The shock location and the shock magnitude agree quite well with the exact
solution. These results demonstrate the good performance of our scheme in symmetry and conservation preservation
and non-oscillatory property.
Example 2 (The Sedov problem in a cylindrical coordinate system with polar grids [19]).

We present the result of the Sedov blast wave in a cylindrical coordinate system as an example of a diverging shock
wave. The initial computational domain is a 14 -circle region deﬁned in a polar coordinates by [0, 1.125] × [0, π/2]
consisting of 100 × 30 equal angular cells. The initial density is unity and the initial velocity is zero. The internal
energy is zero except in the cells connecting the origin where they share a total value of 0.2468. The analytical
solution is a shock at radius unity at time unity with a peak density of 4. Figure 3 shows the results of our scheme by a
purely Lagrangian computation. These results demonstrate that the Lagrangian scheme can produce symmetrical and
accurate results for the Sedov problem in the cylindrical coordinates.
Example 3 (implosion problem of Lazarus).
The implosion problem of Lazarus [12] is a problem with self-similar solution. A sphere of unit initial radius with
zero speciﬁc internal energy and unit density is driven by an inward radial velocity given in good approximation by
vr (t) =

−α f
(1 − f t)1−α

(1)

where α = 0.6883545, f = 1. − εt − δt3 , ε = 0.185, δ = 0.28.
We use a grid of 200 × 30 equal-angle uniform cells in the initial computational domain [0, 1] × [0, π/2] in a polar
coordinates. Figure 4 shows the result of the grid at t = 0.8 and the density as a radial radius function at the typical
time t = 0.74, 0.75, 0.8. Symmetry is preserved quite well as expected for the scheme. In the plot of density, we can
see the shock wave arrives at the origin just after t = 0.75, and at this time the density is ﬂat. At t = 0.8, the shock
wave has reﬂected from the center of convergence and is moving outward into the already shocked medium. This
result and the magnitude of the shock are consistent with the analytical solution shown in [4].

4. Concluding remarks
In this short paper we have brieﬂy described a new cell-centered Lagrangian scheme for solving Euler equations
in cylindrical coordinates. The scheme can preserve the symmetry property for one dimensional spherical problem
computed on an equal-angle-zoned initial grid. Compared with many current Lagrangian type schemes, our scheme
has the distinguished feature in being able to guarantee both symmetry and conservation properties for all conserved
variables including mass, momentum and total energy. Preliminary two dimensional examples in the cylindrical
coordinates have been presented which demonstrate the good performance of the scheme. The extension of the
scheme to high order accuracy constitutes future work.
