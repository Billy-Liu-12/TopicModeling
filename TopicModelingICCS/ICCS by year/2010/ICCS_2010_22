Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds

Abstract
In this paper, we present a Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF) model for the transition matrices (TMs)
of Markov chains (MCs) by assuming the existence of a neighborhood relationship between states, and develop
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators under diﬀerent observation conditions. Unlike earlier work on TM
estimation, our method can make full use of the similarity between diﬀerent states to improve the estimated accuracy,
and the estimator can be performed very eﬃciently by solving a convex programming problem. In addition, we
discuss the parameter choice of the proposed model, and introduce a Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) method.
The numerical simulations of a diﬀusion process are employed to show the eﬀectiveness of the proposed models and
algorithms.

1. Introduction
Markov chain (MC) models provide a general modeling framework for describing state evolutions of stochastic
and memoryless systems, and are now important and powerful tools for an enormous range of mathematical applications, including science, economics, and engineering. Here we only focus on the ﬁnite discrete-time homogeneous
MC model, which is one of the most common MC models, and whose dynamics can be simply characterized by a
transition matrix (TM) T = T i j ∈ Rn×n with T i j the transition probability from the i-th state to the j-th state. In most
applications, the main problem is to estimate the transition probabilities from observed data.
In the past few decades, a lot of diﬀerent techniques have been proposed to estimated the TMs. Many early
researches devoted to the least-square (LS) approaches [1–3], for MC models can be transformed to linear stochastic
systems with zero-mean noise. However, the conventional LS estimators may violate the nonnegative constraints
on TMs. Thus, some restricted LS methods [4–6] based on constrained quadratic programming algorithms were
developed to avoid this problem. Some researchers [2, 5] suggested utilizing the weighted LS and weighted restricted
methods to solve the problem of heteroscedasticity. By now, the best known and most popular estimation method of

MC models is maximum likelihood (ML) estimator which was proposed in [7], for it is consistent and asymptotically
normally distributed as the sample size increases [8], and can be eﬃciently calculated by counting transition pairs.
Some experiments show ML estimator is superior to the LS estimators [9]. Moreover, the ML method can be applied
to revsersible TM estimation for some physical and chemical processes [10].
Recently, the Bayesian approach [11, 12] to TM estimation has received a good deal of attention. In this approach,
an unknown TM is assumed to be a realization of some prior model, and the posterior distribution given observed
data can be obtained by Bayes’ rule. Comparing to the non-Bayesian methods, the Bayesian estimator can provide
much more information than a single point estimate, and is more reliable for small size data set if the prior model
is appropriately designed. The most commonly used prior distribution is the matrix beta distribution with density
θ −1
p (T|Θ) ∝ i, j T i ji j . It is a conjugate prior and can be easily analyzed and eﬃciently sampled since each row of
T follows the Dirichlet distribution. In some applications, Θ = 1 and Θ = 0 are recommended, because p (T|Θ) is
equivalent to the uniform distribution when Θ = 1 [13], and Θ = 0 makes the posterior mean of the TM identical to
the ML estimate [14]. The matrix Θ can also be optimized by using the empirical Bayes approach [15]. The matrix
beta prior distribution based Bayesian estimation of revsersible TM was investigated in [13]. The shortcoming of the
matrix beta prior is that it does not take into account possible correlations between diﬀerent rows of the transition
matrix. Assoudou and Essebbar [16, 17] proposed the Jeﬀreys’ prior (a non-informative prior) model for TMs to
overcome this problem, and no extra parameter is required in this model. However, the Jeﬀreys’ prior distribution is
too complicated for deriving the Bayesian estimator, and can only be applied to MC models with very few states in
practice.
The major objective of this paper is to propose a new prior model for MCs based on the Gaussian Markov random
ﬁled (GMRF). The GMRF [18–21] model is a speciﬁc Gaussian ﬁeld model, and frequently used in spatial statistics
and image processing, which constructs a global distribution of a spatial function by considering the local correlations
between points or regions. In this paper, we assume that the state space of the MC has neighborhood structure and
the adjacent states have similar transition behaviors. This assumption generally holds for the grid based approximate
models of continuous space MCs, and the case that the state space has a distance metric. A GMRF prior model of
TMs is then designed according to the assumption, and the corresponding maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is
developed. In comparison with the existing models, the new prior model is able to utilize the similarity relationship
of states better. And there is only one extra parameter is required, which can be selected by the cross validation (CV)
method. Moreover the estimation problem with noisy data is considered, and the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm is used to get the MAP estimate.
2. Background
2.1. Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds
Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph without loop edges, where V is the set of vertices and E ⊂ V × V is the edge
set. And vertices u, v ∈ V are said to be adjacent iﬀ (u, v) ∈ E, which is denoted by u ∼ v. It is clear that ∀u, v ∈ V,
v v and u ∼ v ⇔ v ∼ u. A Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF) Y on G is a Gaussian stochastic function that
assigns to each vertex v a real number Y (v). Here we only introduce the widely used intrinsic GMRF model [19, 22],
which is often speciﬁed through the following distribution
⎛
⎞
2
⎜⎜ 1
Y (u) − Y (v) ⎟⎟⎟⎟
pGMRF (y|σ) ∝ exp ⎜⎜⎜⎝− 2
(1)
⎟⎠
2σ u∼v
d2 (u, v)

where y = {Y (v) |v ∈ V}, σ is a parameter, and d (·, ·) denotes a distance measure between vertices. It is clear that the
neighboring data points are desired to have the similar values.

2.2. Markov chains
We consider a time-homogeneous Mariv chain (MC) {xt |t ≥ 0} on the ﬁnite state space S = {s1 , . . . , sn }. Its
probability model can be described by a transition matrix (TM) T = T i j ∈ Rn×n whose entries are given by
T i j = p xt+1 = s j |xt = si

where
T i j = 1,

Ti j > 0

(3)

j

Here we deﬁne Ωn = {T|T ∈ Rn×n is a stochasic matrix}, which is a convex set.
And the probability distribution of the ﬁnite-length state sequence {x0 , x1 , . . . , xm } given T can be expressed as
p (x0:m |T) =

C

Ti ji j

(4)

i, j

where entries of count matrix C = Ci j are numbers of observed transition pairs with
Ci j = (xt , xt+1 ) |xt = si , xt+1 = s j , 0 ≤ t ≤ m − 1

(5)

3. GMRF Based MC Model Estimation
3.1. GMRF prior
Given an MC state space S = {s1 , . . . , sn }, the purpose of this subsection is to provide a GMRF model based prior
distribution for the TM T = T i j . Assuming a neighborhood structure on the state space, we construct a neighborhood
relation between the transition pairs as
si , s j ∼ (sk , sl ) ⇔ si , s j ∈ (∂sk ∪ {sk }) × (∂sl ∪ {sl }) \ {(sk , sl )}

(6)

pGMRF (T|σ) ∝ exp (−u (T, σ))

(7)

Then the unknown matrix T can be modeled by GMRF with distribution

where
u (T, σ) =

1
2σ2

( si ,s j )∼(sk ,sl )

⎛
⎞
⎜⎜⎜ T i j − T kl ⎟⎟⎟2
⎟⎟
⎜⎜⎝
di2jkl ⎠

(8)

di jkl is the distance between si , s j and (sk , sl ), and here deﬁned as

d2 (si , sk ) + d2 s j , sl

di jsk =

(9)

However, the realization of distribution (7) does not satisfy (3) in the general case. Therefore we modify the prior
distribution as
⎧
1
⎪
⎪
⎨ z(σ) exp (−u (T, σ)) , T ∈ Ωn
pGMC (T|σ) = pGMRF (T|σ, T ∈ Ωn ) = ⎪
(10)
⎪
⎩0,
T Ωn
where

z (σ) =

exp (−u (T, σ)) dT

(11)

Ωn

3.2. MAP estimation
The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the TM T of an MC from observed data {x0 , . . . , xt } with count
matrix C = Ci j is given by
Tˆ = arg max log p (C|T) + log p (T)
(12)
T

Using the proposed GMRF prior model and assuming the parameter σ is known, (12) is equivalent to the following

It is a convex problem and can be solved without any spurious local minima. In this paper, we perform the optimization
by the diagonalized Newton (DN) method (see [23] for details).

3.3. Choice of σ
We now consider the case that σ is unknown. Motivated by the above analysis, it seems reasonable to jointly estimate T and σ by MAP method. But it is intractable to compute the joint prior distribution p(T, σ) = p(σ)pGMC (T|σ)
for z (σ) has no closed form.
So here we use cross-validation (CV) approach to select the value of σ, and adopt the Monte Carlo cross-validation
(MCCV) method proposed in [24]. The MCCV of a σ is conducted by the following steps:
Step 1. Partition the set of observed state transition pairs randomly into train and test subsets, where the train subset
is a fraction β (typically 0.5) of the overall set, and the corresponding count matrices are denoted by Cktrain and
Cktest .
Step 2. Calculate
Tˆ k (σ) = arg maxn log p Cktrain |T − u (T, σ)
(14)
T∈Ω

and the predictive log-likelihood

CVk (σ) = log p Cktest |Tˆ k (σ)

(15)

σ∗ = arg max CV (σ)

(16)

Step 3. Repeat the above steps for k = 1, . . . , K and select

σ

with CV (σ) =

k CVk

(σ) /K.

It can be seen from (15) that CVk (σ) → −∞ if the (i, j)-th entry of Cktest is positive and that of Tˆ k (σ) convergences
to 0. In order to avoid the possible singularity, we approximate the logarithmic function as
log T i j ≈ PLη T i j =

1 η
T −1
η ij

(17)

when calculating CVk (σ), where η ∈ (0, 1) is a small number (η = 0.1 in this paper). It is easy to prove that
limη→0 PLη (x) = log(x) for x > 0.
4. Estimation with Stochastic Observations
In this section, we will take into account that the actual state transitions are unknown, and only stochastic observations
(18)
ot |xt ∼ p (ot |xt )
for t = 0, . . . , m are available. In this case, the MAP estimator of the TM with prior parameter σ can be expressed by
Tˆ (σ) = arg max log p (O|T) − u (T, σ)
T∈Ωn

(19)

where O = {o0 , . . . , om }, and computed with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [25] consisting of the
following steps:
Step 1. Choose an initial T (0) ∈ Ωn and let k = 0.
Step 2. Compute the functional
Q T|T (k)

=

E log (C (X) |T) − u (T, σ) |T (k) , O

=
i, j

C¯ i j log T i j − u (T, σ)

(20)

where X = {x0 , . . . , xm }, C (X) = Ci j (X) denotes the count matrix of X, and
C¯ = C¯ i j = E C (X) |T (k) , O

(21)

Step 3. Find T (k+1) which maximizes the function Q T|T (k) as

log p O|T (k+1) − u T (k+1) , σ − log p O|T (k) − u T (k) , σ
is small enough.
Step 5. Let k = k + 1 and go to Step 2.
Note that (22) has the same form as (13) with C¯ i j ≥ 0 for any i, j, so (22) is a convex optimization problem and
can be solved by the DN algorithm too.
Further, in a similar manner to Section 3.3, the value of σ can be designed through the MCCV algorithm. Due to
space limitations, we omit details here.
5. Simulations
5.1. Brownian dynamics model
In this section, the estimation method proposed in this paper will be applied to a Brownian dynamics (BD) model,
which is described as
dr = − f (r) dt + ρdW
(23)

where ρ = 1.4, W is a standard Brownian motion, f (r) = dV (r) /dr and V (r) is the potential function (see Fig. 1)

Discretizing the motion equation (23) with time step Δt = 10−3 and decomposing the state space {r|0 ≤ r ≤ 2} into
n = 100 “cells” S = {s1 , . . . , sn } with si = 2i−1
n , we can get the grid based approximate MC model

The corresponding TM T = T i j is shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the neighborhood structure on S is here deﬁned by
∂si = {si−1 , si+1 } ∩ S with distance measure d si , s j = |i − j|.
5.2. TM estimation
Here, we will use the MAP method presented in Section 3 to estimate the TM T based on a realization {r (t) |0 ≤ t ≤ 3}
of (23) (see Fig. 3), and compare it with the ML method [12]. Fig. 4 plots the MCCV results of σ and the optimal
σ∗ = 0.06159.
The comparisons of the diﬀerent estimators are based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate metric [26]
deﬁned as

KLR Tˆ T =

where πˆ = [ˆπi ] denotes the stationary distribution of TM Tˆ = Tˆ i j . It can measure the distances between Markov
chains on the same state space.

Fig. 5 shows the estimation results of the proposed MAP method with diﬀerent σ and ML method. Clearly, the
ML method fails to estimate the values T i j with i ∈ [1, 7] ∪ [34, 44] ∪ [91, 100] for there are few xk are sampled
within the ranges. The GMRF prior based MAP estimator overcome this problem by interpolating from the other
T i j according to the GMRF model. Moreover, as observed from the ﬁgures, the parameter σ determines the overall
smoothness of the estimated TM, and the MCCV approach can provide an appropriate value of σ.
5.3. TM estimation with noisy data
In this subsection, we study the performance of our proposed algorithms for estimating T from noisy observations
o (t) |r (t) ∼ N r (t) , v2

(27)

with v = 0.1.
The MAP estimator with GMRF prior in Section 4 will now be compared to the ML estimator implemented using
Baum-Welch algorithm [27]. The MCCV results are shown in Fig. 6 and the optimal σ∗ = 0.1947.
In Fig. 7, we show plots for Tˆ obtained using our MAP estimator with σ = σ∗ , 3σ∗ and 0.06159 (σ∗ in Subsection
5.2) and ML estimator. As can be seen from Fig. 7d, the ML estimator exhibits strong overﬁtting. With comparison
to ML method, the proposed MAP estimator avoids overﬁtting by the regularization term u (T, σ), which penalizes
excessively large value of T i j .

Note that here σ∗ = 0.1947 is bigger than the σ∗ = 0.06159 in the previous subsection, which may be related to
noisy observation and insuﬃcient sample size. From Figs. 5a and 7c, we can see that the observation noise makes Tˆ
obtained from {o0 , . . . , om } smoother than that directly estimated by states {x0 , . . . , xm }. Therefore the MCCV approach
will select a bigger σ∗ to get a suitably smooth Tˆ and maximize the predictive likelihood.
6. Conclusions
The GMRF model of TMs discussed in this paper provides a general and ﬂexible framework for analyzing and
estimating MCs with “smooth” TMs by extending the neighborhood relationship between states to that between
transition pairs. This model is helpful to improve the robustness and accuracy of estimators in many practical cases,
especially when the sample size is small with respect to the size of state space. And the convex form of GMRF model
beneﬁts the numerical calculation. The parameter choice is a diﬃcult problem for our model, but it can be solved by
CV methods since there is only one undetermined parameter.
