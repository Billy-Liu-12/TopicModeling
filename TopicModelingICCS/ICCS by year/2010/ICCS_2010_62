A two scale model of air corona discharges

Abstract
This paper deals with the modelling of plasma discharges induced by electrohydrodynamic actuators. We propose
a multi-model method based on ﬂuid conservation equations that allows an increase of the maximum time step imposed by usual explicit schemes. The idea consists in replacing the numerical integration of the plasma equations at
the vicinity of the electrodes – where the time step is particularly limited – by a simpliﬁed model adapted to the local
plasma dynamics. In this study, we apply this method to the modelling of wire-induced discharges and we present the
numerical results obtained for an unsteady 2D simulation of a reference test case.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we are interested in the modelling and numerical simulation of plasma discharges induced by electrohydrodynamic (EHD) actuators. Such devices have been the subject of a growing interest over the last decade
[1] and present many advantages: they can be used at atmospheric pressure, do not involve any mechanical parts
and have a very short response delay. Their action on the aerodynamic ﬂow is due to a momentum transfer between
the charged particles of the plasma and the neutral molecules of the surrounding gas. It generates a secondary ﬂow,
usually referred to as the ionic wind, that is able to modify the velocity proﬁle of the boundary layer.
The simulation of the ionic wind is often limited by the important numerical cost required. Indeed, the physics
of a plasma discharge at atmospheric pressure consists in complex mechanisms, where multi-scale phenomena and
a large amount of reactions occur. The shortest time scale of the plasma is mostly governed by the transport of the
charged species, the chemical reactions or the dielectric relaxation, therefore the numerical integration of the plasma
equations usually imposes very restrictive time step limitations that make simulations on long time scales diﬃcult to
achieve.
The dielectric relaxation time limitation in high density plasma discharges have been the subject of many researches, particularly in the ﬁeld of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) where several methods to overcome such a
constraint have been proposed [2] [3]. However, simulations of plasma discharges induced by EHD actuators are
mostly restricted by the CFL condition associated to the time integration of the transport equations. Semi-implicit

solvers have been developed with the Scharfetter and Gummel scheme [4], where the time step is limited by neither
the CFL condition nor the dielectric relaxation time. This scheme is however quite diﬀusive and remains only ﬁrst
order accurate. More recently, Unfer [5] proposed an asynchronous scheme with local time stepping and adaptive
mesh reﬁnement strategies. The method allows a signiﬁcant reduction of the computational cost for the simulation of
dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) on a cartesian grid but results in a nontrivial implementation.
In this paper, we propose a diﬀerent approach where the most restraining areas in terms of time step condition are
modelled by simpliﬁed equations adapted to the local plasma dynamics. The basic ideas behind such a model have
been presented in a previous work, in which a steady 1D model was developed for the simulation of wire-to-wire
corona discharges [6]. In this work, we extend the method to a more general context and we adapt it to develop an
unsteady 2D solver for wire-induced corona discharges.
The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the general concept of the method as well as the
underlying model assumptions. Section 3 describes the application of the method to wire-induced corona discharges
and is divided into three parts. In section 3.1, we ﬁrst remind the usual plasma ﬂuid model and we deﬁne the kinetics
taken into account. In a second part, we develop the approximate model adapted to the setup studied (section 3.2) and
we ﬁnally present the numerical simulation of a reference test case in section 3.3.
2. Concept
Numerical simulations using explicit schemes face a severe time step restriction known as the Courant-FriedrichLevy (CFL) condition. This constraint has to be imposed over the whole mesh and is limited by the minimum of the
CFL condition all over the domain. For plasma discharges induced by EHD actuators, the CFL condition is governed
by the electrons velocity whose maximum is often located near the electrodes and can be several orders of magnitude
higher than in the rest of the domain. Moreover, the steep variations of the electric ﬁeld and the particularly active
chemical kinetics at the vicinity of the electrodes impose an important reﬁnement of the mesh in that area. The
intensity of the electric ﬁeld being very important around the electrodes, the electrons are carried at high velocity and
the CFL condition becomes very restrictive.
In order to overcome such a limitation, we propose an approximate model, where the numerical integration of the
plasma equations near the electrodes is replaced by a quasi-analytical solution. The idea of the method is to develop
a simpliﬁed model that takes into account the main part of the plasma dynamics near the electrodes while giving a
solution limited by neither mesh nor time step restrictions. We will refer to this model as the asymptotic model.
In a plasma discharge, the electric ﬁeld and the charged species densities are strongly coupled: the production
rates of the charged particles are mainly governed by the electric ﬁeld intensity while this last one is modiﬁed by the
local charge. This link is however weaker at the vicinity of the electrodes, where the charged particles are most of the
time in insuﬃcient amount to modify signiﬁcantly the electric ﬁeld.
According to this observation, we neglect the inﬂuence of the local charge on the electric ﬁeld in a thin layer
around each electrode. In these areas, the electric potential can then be described analytically and the evolution of
the charged particles densities satisﬁes a set of 1D convection-reaction equations directed along the electric ﬁeld
lines. The chemical kinetics are also simpliﬁed to their main part, namely ionisation of the neutral particles of the
air. Indeed, this reaction is one of the major processes occurring in a plasma discharge. It produces a large amount of
charged particles and is only triggered when the electric ﬁeld intensity is high enough. In the case of EHD devices,
such electric ﬁelds are mostly located near the electrodes and ionisation of the neutral particles in these areas is so
important that other reactions are negligible. We lastly assume that the plasma reaches its steady-state almost instantly
near the electrodes.
In the rest of the domain, the discharge is described using an usual plasma ﬂuid model and the continuity between
the two models is ensured with adequate boundary conditions. The continuity of the electric ﬁeld imposes a Robin
boundary condition on the border linking the two models, while the species density exchanges are determined by the
asymptotic model solved at each point of these borders. The areas where the asymptotic model is applied then act as
virtual electrodes of wider radii giving ﬁctive boundary conditions to the classical scheme.

3. Application to corona discharges induced by a cylinder
In this section, we apply the methodology described in section 2 to wire-induced corona discharges. We ﬁrst
remind the plasma equations commonly used to model collisional discharges, where the charged particles mean free
path is much smaller than the characteristic lengths of the setup studied, and we deﬁne the chemical kinetics taken
into account. In a second time, we develop our asymptotic model for a single circular cylinder and we specify the
boundary conditions obtained. We ﬁnally compare our approximate model to a reference test case solved with a fully
explicit scheme.
3.1. Plasma ﬂuid model
The evolution of the charged species densities is described by a set of convection-reaction equations, coupled
with a Poisson equation for the electric ﬁeld variations. The density Nk of the specie k is solution of the following
conservation equation:
∂t Nk + ∇. (Nk Uk ) = ωk ,

(1)

where ωk is the production rate of the specie k and Uk its velocity. The discharge is studied in absence of any
aerodynamic ﬂow and the velocities of the charged particles are linked to the electric ﬁeld by mobility laws: for the
specie k, if Zk denotes the electric charge, μk the mobility and E the electric ﬁeld, then the velocity Uk is given by:
Uk = sign(Zk )μk E.

(2)

The electric ﬁeld E derives from an electric potential ϕ:
E = −∇ϕ,

(3)

where ϕ satisﬁes the following Poisson equation:
−Δϕ =

e
ε0

Zk Nk .

(4)

k

In this paper, we assume for the sake of simplicity that the plasma consists in electrons, a positive ion specie and a
negative one, respectively indiced by e, +, −. The main source of electrons is the ion-induced secondary emission at
the surface of the electrodes, of coeﬃcient γ. The chemical kinetics takes into account ionisation of neutral particles,
electronic attachment and recombination. Therefore, the production rates ωk are written as:
ωe = αNe |Ue | − ηNe |Ue | − βNe N+ ,
ω+ = αNe |Ue | − βNe N+ − βN− N+ ,

ω− = ηNe |Ue | − βN− N+ ,

(5a)
(5b)
(5c)

where α, β denotes respectively the ionisation and the recombination rates and η is the electronic attachment coeﬃcient.
The electronic mobility as well as the ionisation and electronic attachment coeﬃcients are functions of the electric
ﬁeld intensity and their values are taken from the Bolsig numerical code [7]. The recombination rate and the ionic
mobility are assumed independent of the electric ﬁeld. Their values are ﬁxed to:

3.2. Asymptotic model
We consider a circular cylinder of radius a raised to a voltage ϕ0 . We suppose that the discharge is locally governed
by this electrode and that the inﬂuence of distant objects – such as another electrode – is negligible.
Let Ω be a bounded open space of R2 and ∂Ω its border. Let x denote an element of Ω and r, θ its polar coordinates.
We suppose that D(0, 1) ⊂ Ω, where D(0, α) denotes the disc of radius α centered on 0 (see ﬁgure 1). Lastly, we deﬁne:

Ωα = Ω \ D(0, α),
Dα,β = D(0, α) \ D(0, β),

carry out the change of scale r = r/ε and formally truncate the set of equations (10) to the lowest order in ε. Then, we

Having an analytical expression of the electric ﬁeld in Dε,a , we develop a simpliﬁed model for the equations
governing the evolution of the charged particles densities. Some assumptions are made so that this model can be
solved quasi-analytically. First, we suppose that electric potential varies smoothly on the border γε , i.e. that :
|∂θ ϕε (ε, θ)|

(16)

The electric ﬁeld is then directed radially in Dε,a and the set of equations (1) can be written as 1D equations that
spatially depend only on the distance r to the center of the electrode. Secondly, we assume that the discharge reaches
its steady-state instantly in Dε,a . The time dependency of the discharge in this area is only taken into account by the
evolution of the boundary conditions on the border γε . Then, we deﬁne a dimensionless form of those equations with
the following set of scale-changes:

where Γk is the ﬂux of the specie k and is deﬁned by:

with Uεk being the radial velocity of the specie k whose value is given by the formula:
Uεk (r, θ) = Zk μk

ϕ0 − ϕε (ε, θ)
.
r ln(ε/a)

(20)

For a given angle θ, the sign of Uεk is constant for all r and depends only on the value of ϕε on the border γε . We
distinguish two cases:
• when ϕ0 < ϕε (ε, θ), the positive ions come from the domain Ωε and move towards the electrode, while the negatively
charged species move in the opposite direction. The ion-induced secondary emission provides an additional source
of electrons at the surface of the electrode.
• when ϕ0 > ϕε (ε, θ), the negatively charged species come form Ωε and move towards the electrode while the positive
ions move in the opposite direction. No positive ions are produced at the surface of the electrode.
As a consequence, the boundary conditions associated to (18) and its solutions depend on the sign of ϕ0 − ϕε (ε, θ) and
we have:
Proposition 1. The solution of the problem (18) depends on the value of ϕε on the border γε :

3.3. Numerical results

In this section, we present a reference test case that consists in the 2D simulation of a discharge induced by two
coaxial cylinders of length L. The inner electrode of radius ra is raised to a positive potential ϕ0 while the outer
electrode of radius rc is connected to the ground and the system is supposed to be connected to an external power
supply of resistance R. The asymptotic model developed in section 3.2 is applied on a thin layer of radius ε ≥ ra
around the anode while the solution in the domain Ωε is computed using an explicit scheme. The domain Ωra is here
deﬁned as the gap between the inner and the outer electrodes, however the problem has a rotational symetry and its
numerical integration on the whole domain is unnecessary. Here, we choose to simulate the discharge on a small part
of Ωra deﬁned by:

ra = x ∈ Ωra , 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/8 .

this domain, the transport equations (1) are solved by a ﬁnite volume method precise to the ﬁrst order in time and to
the second order in space (MUSCL-type scheme). The Poisson equation (4) is solved by a P1 Finite Element Method
and the evolution of the potential at the surface of the electrodes is modelled by the Sato formula [9], which takes into
account the inﬂuence of the external circuit.

The simulation parameters are indicated in table 1. The resistance R of the external circuit is ﬁxed to a low value
so that the current computed is only due to the motion of the charged particles and the potential ϕ0 at the surface of the

The discharge current over the simulated time is represented ﬁgure 2(a) for several value of ≥ ra . The solution of
the fully explicit scheme corresponds to ε = ra . The discharge current computed for ε = 2 ra is globally 30% higher
than the current computed with the fully explicit scheme. Although the current pulses observed have a higher frequency, the evolution of the discharge is relatively well represented. This increase of the pulse frequency is explained
by the steady-state hypothesis of the model in the domain Dε,ra which assumes that the charged species generated in
this domain are instantly transported into the domain Ωε . These diﬀerences are rapidly attenuated as ε decreases and
the solution of the approximate model converges towards the solution of the original plasma ﬂuid model when ε tends
to ra . For ε = 1.5 ra , the current intensity diﬀers approximatively by 3%, whereas for ε = 1.005 ra diﬀerences lower
than 0.4% are observed.

The number densities proﬁles at t = 5μs, represented ﬁgure 2(b), are also in good agreement with the solution of
the fully explicit scheme. The solution remains smooth through the border γε and converges towards the solution of
the fully explicit scheme as ε tends to ra .

been triggered. The inﬂuence of the asymptotic model on the transport of the charged species is well illustrated here:
the second wave of ions is instantly produced at the border γε and the domain Dε,ra , where the model is applied, acts

The CFL condition at time t = 5μs as a function of ε is reported table 2. For ε ≥ 1.5 ra , the maximum time step
authorized is more than doubled. This gain is mainly due to the fast descrease of the electric ﬁeld intensity as the
radius increases and is limited by the mesh we chose. Here, we use a rather homogenous mesh, where the maximum
size of a cell is limited to a very small value. However, EHD plasma discharges are usually computed on meshes
much more reﬁned at the vicinity of the electrodes than in the rest of the domain. In these cases, the gain on the CFL
condition and on the computational cost are expected to be even more important.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed an approximate model for wire-induced corona discharges, where the numerical integration of the plasmas equations in a thin layer around the electrodes is replaced by a simpliﬁed model. This model
has been tested on a 2D test case and its convergence towards the usual plasma ﬂuid model as the thickness of the
layer decreases has been numerically veriﬁed. The maximum time step allowed is more than doubled while the plasma
dynamics remain well represented. Moreover, an additional gain in terms of computational time is expected for the
simulation of actual actuator setups where the mesh is particularly reﬁned near the electrodes.
The methodology described here can be adapted to other types of discharges. We are currently extending the
model to the simulation of point-induced discharges. For this type of setup, our asymptotic model would provide the
possibility to analytically take into account the electric ﬁeld singularity, thus avoiding any mesh-related problem at
the vicinity of the point.
