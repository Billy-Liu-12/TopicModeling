Abstract
A reduced order modelling approach for predicting steady aerodynamic ﬂows and loads data based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and global Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), that is, POD for multiple
diﬀerent variables of interest simultaneously, is presented. A suitable data transformation for obtaining problemadapted global basis modes is introduced.
Model order reduction is achieved by parameter space sampling, reduced solution space representation via global
POD and restriction of a CFD ﬂow solver to the reduced POD subspace. Solving the governing equations of ﬂuid
dynamics is replaced by solving a non-linear least-squares optimization problem. Methods for obtaining feasible
starting solutions for the optimization procedure are discussed.
The method is demonstrated by computing reduced-order solutions to the compressible Euler equations for the
NACA 0012 airfoil based on two diﬀerent snapshot sets; one in the subsonic and one in the transonic ﬂow regime,
where shocks occur. Results are compared with those obtained by POD-based interpolation using Kriging and the
Thin Plate Spline method (TPS).

1. Introduction
Given the large amount of aerodynamic data and load cases that need to be evaluated to achieve aircraft certiﬁcation, eﬃcient tools for making rapid but accurate predictions of the aerodynamic loads acting on an aircraft
throughout its ﬂight envelope and beyond are sought after. The loads can be used in determining preliminary structural sizing and to support wing trade studies, for example. For background information, consult e .g. [1].
Following the approach of LeGresley and Alonso [2], a reduced order model (ROM) for predicting steady aerodynamic ﬂows and loads data has been developed based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and global Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), that is, POD for multiple diﬀerent variables of interest simultaneously. The
reader is referred to [3] for a comprehensive introduction to POD.
The method can be summarized as follows: After sampling a design space of interest by computing so-called snapshot solutions at a ﬁnite number of parameter combinations (e.g. of Mach number Ma and angle of attack α) with a
CFD ﬂow solver, POD is performed to obtain a (possibly reduced) orthogonal representation of the space spanned

by these snapshots. Subsequently, to predict the ﬂow solution at an unsampled point in the parameter space, the
objective is to ﬁnd the ﬂux-residual minimizing ﬂow solution contained in the POD subspace. For doing so, the
DLR CFD ﬂow solver TAU [4, 5] is restricted to the POD subspace and a non-linear least-squares optimization
problem is solved. The method will be referred to as POD-subspace restricted least-squares method. While other
promising, more sophisticated approaches for non-linear model reduction have been suggested [6, 7], this method
has the additional advantage, that it is relatively easy to implement using an existing industrial CFD code, a fact
not to be underestimated.
For a CFD-based residual evaluation, it is necessary that each ﬂow solution snapshot contains data for all ﬂow
variables associated to the (spatially discretized) governing equations of ﬂuid dynamics at once. Consequently,
global POD basis modes have to account simultaneously for a large variety of diﬀerent information. For example,
for the inviscid, compressible Euler equations, the primitive ﬂow variables are density, the velocity components in
each coordinate direction and energy and their values may diﬀer by some orders of magnitude.
Moreover, since POD is a mathematical orthogonalization method, there is no reason for the basis modes not to
feature e.g. negative density values. In other words, physics might be disrespected in the basis modes, which
in turn can result in the inapplicability of the high-ﬁdelity CFD solver to evaluate ﬂux residuals inside the POD
subspace.
A data transformation tackling both of the above challenges is applied in order to obtain a global POD representation with balanced inﬂuence from all variables. Diﬀerent approaches of how to compute feasible starting solutions
for the optimization procedure are discussed. These issues were not treated in [2].
The method is demonstrated by computing reduced-order solutions to the Euler equations for the NACA 0012
airfoil based on two diﬀerent snapshot sets; one in the subsonic and one in the transonic regime, where shocks, or,
mathematically speaking, discontinuities occur. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst application
of the POD-subspace restricted least-squares method to transonic ﬂows. Results are compared with those obtained
by POD-based interpolation [8] using Kriging [9, 10] and the Thin Plate Spline method (TPS).
2. Theoretical Background
Considering the compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations [11], spatially discretized on a computational
grid of size n ∈ N around a given aerodynamic body, let v ∈ N be the corresponding number of ﬂow variables. For
example, for the Euler equations, the primitive ﬂow variables are density, the velocity components in all spatial
directions and energy; thus, v = 4 for 2D Euler problems and v = 5 for 3D Euler problems. Let nt = vn denote the
total dimension of the discretized ﬂow solution vector. The diﬀerential equation for steady ﬂows to be solved in
pseudo-time reads
(1)
∂t W + R(W) = 0,
where W is the vector of primitive variables and R : Rnt → Rnt is the (highly non-linear) ﬂux residual [11]. Hence,
the steady state is attained if the time derivative vanishes, i.e. if
0 = R(W) ∈ Rnt .

(2)

Note that the ﬂux residual features nt free unknowns and equation (2) is thus also of this precise order.
2.1. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
We will brieﬂy review POD in ﬁnite dimensional euclidean vector spaces. Theoretical details can be found in
[12] and references therein. Let each superscript i = 1, ..., m denote a certain combination of independent (ﬂow)

parameters, e.g. i=(Ma

Y = (W 1 , ..., W m ) ∈ Rnt ×m .

Choosing suitable ﬂow parameter combinations for snapshot computation is a very important issue of its own, yet
beyond the scope of this work.
The objective of POD is to represent the space spanned by the snapshots by mutually orthogonal basis modes
ordered by information content. Precise mathematical formulation leads to an optimization problem, which in turn
can be reduced to solving the nt × nt -dimensional eigenvalue problem
YY T U j = λ j U j ∈ Rnt ,

j = 1, ..., m.

(3)

In order to reduce the computational eﬀort, the eigenvectors U j , j = 1, ..., m , also called POD basis modes, can be
obtained by solving the usually much smaller m × m-dimensional eigenvalue problem
(Y T Y)V j = λ j V j ∈ Rm , j = 1, ..., m.

(4)

This is the so-called method of snapshots [14]. The basis modes can then be computed via
U j = ( λ j )−1 YV j ∈ Rnt ,

j = 1, ..., m.

The relative information content of the jth mode is deﬁned as the ratio r j = λ j
mation content (RIC) of the ﬁrst m
˜ ≤ m basis modes is given by

The space spanned by the ﬁrst m
˜ ≤ m POD basis modes is the best order-m-representation
˜
of the initial snapshot
space with respect to the underlying scalar product. A common choice is to take m
˜ such that RIC(m)
˜ ≥ 0.999, that
is, such that the ﬁrst m
˜ modes contain 99.9% of the information provided by the snapshots.
Remark: For the results presented here, not the snapshot matrix Y itself, but the transformed matrix T (Y) was
decomposed, see next section.
The POD basis may also be obtained via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), yet the authors’ implementation
of the method of snapshots using the eigenvalue routines as presented in [15] turned out to be faster by a factor of
4 than the LAPACK[16] SVD, while still maintaining suﬃcient accuracy.
2.2. Data Transformation
The demands on global POD basis modes in the present context are manifold. They have to account for
variables in diﬀerent units and ranges of values, they have to capture the main solution features for each ﬂow
variable simultaneously, and ideally, any linear combination of modes should give a physically feasible solution.
In order to come close to these requirements, the snapshot data is transformed as outlined in the following.
Let f1 , ..., fv denote the given ﬂow variables, e.g. f1 = ρ = density. The snapshot matrix Y is devided into subblocks Y T = (Y f1 )T , ..., (Y fv )T , where Y fk ∈ Rn×m contains the snapshot data associated to the ﬂow variable fk ,
k = 1, ..., v. Note that Y T Y = vk=1 (Y fk )T Y fk . If one ﬂow variable fk0 dominates the remaining ones by some
orders of magnitude, as it is the case for pressure in ﬂuid ﬂow problems, then Y T Y ≈ (Y fk0 )T Y fk0 . Hence, the POD
eigenmodes will essentially be fk0 -modes with minor inﬂunce from the remaining variables.
In order to arrive at a balanced decomposition, for each ﬂow variable, the mean value over all available snapshot

S = diag s−1

where each I ∈ Rn×n denotes a unit matrix diagonal block.
To support physical feasibility of linear combinations of POD modes, the data is centred by subtracting the rowwise snapshot mean values. This results in an aﬃne POD subspace representation, as suggested in [17]. Deﬁning
A = (avg1 , ..., avgnt )T ∈ Rnt via avgi = m1 mj=1 Yi j , the complete (non-orthogonal) data transformation reads
T : Rnt ×m → Rnt ×m , Y → S (Y − A (1, ..., 1)).

Orthogonal decomposition as described in section 2.1 is performed for the transformed snapshot matrix Yˆ = T (Y).
For a given vector a of POD coeﬃcients, the corresponding ﬂow solution is constructed as follows:

ak S −1 U k + A.
(7)
W(a) = S −1 ⎜⎜⎜⎝ ak U k ⎟⎟⎟⎠ + A =

k=1

Hence, for computing an approximate ﬂow solution in the reduced space at a certain parameter combination, it is
suﬃcient to compute the associated coeﬃcient vector a. The constant mean ﬂow vector A shifts the mathematical
construction back to the range of physical values.
Remark: Generally, sub-blocks of global POD modes will not form orthogonal sub-bases.
If a dominated POD is desirable, this can be achieved by adjusting the scaling factors sk .

is by far more eﬃcient than direct component-wise interpolation of the snapshot vectors, where nt interpolation
procedures, each considering m sample points are due. Details can be found in [8].
For the results presented in this paper, Kriging [10, 13], and the Thin Plate Spline Method (TPS) [13], were applied
for multi-dimensional interpolation.
2.4. Reduced Order Modelling
While in the previous section a purely mathematics-based approach of obtaining POD coeﬃcients was outlined,
we now present a method which takes ﬂow physics into account. To this end the coeﬃcients of the reduced solution
are determined by minimizing the associated ﬂux residual as suggested in [2], which is evaluated using the DLR
CFD solver TAU [4, 5]. Precise mathematical formulation of the unconstrained optimization problem gives

which is a non-linear least squares problem. Of all ﬂow solution vectors, which allow for a representation of the

CFD solution for the given parameter combination.

In this way, solving the order-nt equation system (2) is replaced by solving the order-m
In order to achieve appropriate optimization performance, the gradient-based Levenberg-Marquardt method [18]
is applied. Hence the Jacobian of the ﬂux residual with respect to the POD coeﬃcients is required. For the results
presented here, the Jacobian is obtained using ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation and rank-one Broyden updates [18].
The associated step sizes are weighted by the eigenvalues corresponding to the POD coeﬃcients.
We suggest three ways of initialing the optimization procedure:

Figure 1: Snapshot set and POD modes used for building the ROM at Mach 0.3. Density ﬁelds.

• Start from the highest energy POD basis mode: ainit = (1.0, 0.0, ..., 0.0), W init = S −1 U 1 + A

• Start from the snapshot average ainit = (0.0, 0.0, ..., 0.0), W 0 = A
• Start from an interpolated solution according to section 2.3.

The choice of appropriate approaches is problem dependent. The ﬁrst approach is recommended when it is expected that the ﬁrst mode already captures the main features of the solution and the ﬂow has to be estimated at a
parameter combination far in the extrapolatory regime, where interpolation methods are bound to fail. The second
approach is fail safe, since physical feasibility is guaranteed by construction. In fact, the main reason for the centering by the average is to shift the data into the range of physically feasible values. Yet, the average ﬂow vector
might be far from the optimum. The third approach is recommended for predictions in the interpolatory regime,
where POD based interpolation[8] is known to give good results and thus is expected to provide a good starting
guess.
Note that the solution to (8) is constructed relying entirely on the information contained in the initial snapshot set.
Therefore, order reduction as well as reduction error is introduced by both POD mode reduction and snapshotbased sampling of the parameter space. The method described above is referred to as POD-subspace restricted
least squares method.
3. Results
The method introduced above will be demonstrated by computing reduced-order solutions to the compressible
Euler equations for the NACA0012 airfoil based on two diﬀerent snapshot sets; one in the subsonic and one in

the transonic regime. More precisely, the ﬁrst data set consists of ﬁve ﬂow solutions at Ma = 0.3 and α = 0.0◦ ,
2.0◦ , 4.0◦ , 6.0◦ , 8.0◦ , whereas the second one consists of ﬂow solutions at the same set of angles of attack but at a
transonic Mach number of Ma = 0.73. The unstrutured computational grid features 1, 140 points and is shown in
Fig. 3. Results will be compared with those obtained by POD-based interpolation using Kriging and the Thin-Plate
Spline (TPS) method.
We emphasize that in both test cases, the data transformation according to (6) proved to be essential in order to
obtain physical solutions throughout the optimization procedure. Hence, a comparison of results with and without
applying (6) is simply not possible, since in the latter case, no results were obtained.

In the optimization routine, the ﬂux residual, see eqs. (1), (2), is scaled by a factor of 10n = 1,140
in order to avoid
numerical problems due to too small numbers. Since the residuals feature about the same order of magnitude for
all ﬂow variables, it is suﬃcient to apply a global factor. The scaled residual is denoted by RROM .
In this section, the POD modes are numbered starting from 0.
3.1. NACA0012 Euler Computations at Mach 0.3
Fig. 1 shows the density ﬁelds of the snapshots used to build the reduced order model (ROM). POD results in
an orthogonal representation where the ﬁrst two modes contain 0.999702% + 0.00029464% > 0.999996% of the
total information content. Only these two modes and the mode of averaged ﬂow data are used for the ROM and
for the POD coeﬃcient interpolation; the corresponding density ﬁelds are also displayed in Fig. 1 . Since the ﬂow
average is a constant vector that is not subject to any estimation/optimization procedure, the associated ROM is
of order 2, hence, the initial ﬂow problem of order nt = 4 · 1, 140 = 4, 560 is reduced to an order-2 optimization

problem.
Converged snapshots were computed with the number of iterations (in pseudo time) limited to 200. All computations were performed on a serial desktop computer. Approximate ﬂow solutions were computed at α = −14.0◦ ,
using TPS, Kriging and the POD-based ROM. The reference solution computed with the DLR TAU code converged
after 229 iterations at these conditions. Since the NACA0012 airfoil is symmetric, it is expected that the chosen
snapshot set contains suﬃcient information to predict the ﬂow at this condition. In regard of the interpolation
methods, however, this point is far in the extrapolation regime. The highest-energy mode was used as a starting
point for the ROM optimization procedure. The initial residual was RROM W init = 25.921.
The ROM solution was obtained after 13 TAU CFD residual evaluations; during the optimization the residual was
decreased by three orders of magnitude, the ﬁnal residual being: RROM (W opt ) = 0.1260.
Corresponding density ﬁelds and POD coeﬃcients are given in Fig. 2. The ROM solution is observed to be in
better agreement with the converged TAU solution than the interpolation-based results. The corresponding surface
pressure distributions are displayed in Fig. 5, left side. Note that the ROM solution is in best agreement with
the converged reference TAU solution while the interpolation-based solutions underpredict the suction peak on the
upper side of the airfoil and overpredict the overpressure on the lower side. The following table summarizes the
computational expenses.

3.2. NACA0012 Euler Computations at Mach 0.73
Fig. 3 shows the density ﬁelds of the snapshots used to build the ROM in the transonic ﬂow regime. POD
results in an orthogonal representation where the ﬁrst four modes capture the complete information contained in
the snapshot set. The precise information content of the sorted modes is r0 = 0.989633, r1 = 0.008376, r2 =
0.0014540, r3 = 0.000537. All four modes and the mode of the averaged ﬂow data are used for the ROM as well
as for the POD coeﬃcient interpolation; the corresponding density ﬁelds are shown in the same ﬁgure. Since the
ﬂow average is a constant vector that is not subject to any estimation/optimization procedure, the associated ROM
is of order 4, hence, the initial ﬂow problem of order nt = 4, 560 is reduced to an order-4 optimization problem.
As before, converged snapshots were computed with the number of iterations limited to 200. All computations
were performed on a serial desktop computer. Approximate ﬂow solutions were computed at α = 11.0◦ , using
TPS, Kriging and the POD-based ROM. The TAU reference solution at these conditions converged after 201 time
steps. The TPS-interpolated solution was used as a starting point for the ROM optimization. The initial residual
was: RROM (W T PS ) = 34.104.
The ROM solution is obtained after 13 TAU residual evaluations, the ﬁnal residual being: RROM (W opt ) = 2.956.
Density ﬁelds are given in Fig. 4, the associated surface pressure distributions are displayed in Fig. 5, right side.
While all approximate solutions predict the correct shock location, the ROM solution is in best agreement with
the converged reference TAU solution in terms of the pressure levels upstream of the shock. By coincidence, the
computational expenses are the same as listed in the table in section 3.1.
4. Conclusions
A reduced order model (ROM) for solving the governing ﬂuid ﬂow equations, called POD-subspace restricted
least squares model, has been developed based on the DLR CFD solver TAU. Preliminary tests of the method
were carried out for building ROMs of the Euler equations based on two diﬀerent sets of ﬂow solutions for the
NACA0012 airfoil computed with the DLR TAU code, one in the subsonic and one in the transonic ﬂow regime.

From a mathematical point of view, the problem order has been reduced by the factor 2, 280 in the ﬁrst and by the
factor 1, 140 in the second case.
Approximate ﬂow solutions were computed at extrapolatory conditions, where the ﬂow is diﬃcult to predict using
snapshot-based methods. Results of a POD-based interpolation approach using Kriging or TPS estimators and
of the ROM were compared. While the ROM comes at a higher computational cost than the interpolation-based
methods, the corresponding approximate ﬂow solutions were signiﬁcant closer to the CFD solution, considered as
the exact reference, than those obtained via the interpolation methods. The shock present in the transonic case was
best captured by the ROM.
Since the computational grid associated with the NACA0012 airfoil is of relatively small size, all computations
were performed very fast and the total computational expenses are assumed to be dominated by computational
overhead. Hence, CPU time eﬀort is not the appropriate measure for judging these preliminary results, but the
absolute number of residual evaluations. In this regard, acceleration by a factor of 17 in the subsonic case, resp. of
15 in the transonic case was obtained by using the ROM compared to the full-order TAU solution. Note that the
diﬀerence in the acceleration factors is caused by the diﬀerent number of residual evaluations required to obtain
the reference CFD solution (229 resp. 201), whereas the ROM converged in both the subsonic and transonic case
after the same number of 13 iterations.
The data transformation described in section 2.2 rendered an application of the POD-subspace restricted leastsquares method to the above test cases possible in the ﬁrst place.
Future work will address applying the method to large industrial 3D test cases and the Navier-Stokes equations, as
well as a comparison of the global POD method to variable-by-variable POD. The latter approach results in a gain
of information, but comes at a higher number of optimization parameters.
