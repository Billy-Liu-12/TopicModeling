1. Introduction
Social networks are now in the center of Web algorithms development efforts because of their central role in
contemporary Web development. Main tasks are related to community structure recognition and understanding of
the social role of different actors by link structure [1]. To test these algorithms effectiveness (how precise is the
answer set to the information need) and efficiency (in time and memory usage), researchers need models of social
networks which capture main statistical properties of real world networks with well defined community structure. In
the model case as opposed to a real network, the correct result of an algorithm is known, and the network size may
vary widely, so different algorithms may be tested and compared in different conditions.
The list of main social network properties includes hierarchical community structure [2], Small World property
[3], power law distribution of nodes degree [3], self-similarity [4]. For complex networks the models proposed
explain power law nature of degree distribution. The most basic is Barabasi-Albert model of scale free network [5].
Other models presented in [3]. But these models have no communities, so they are not usable in the case of social
networks. Recently some models were proposed with community structure [6-8], but these models have no smallworld property.
In this paper a set of models for social networks is proposed. The models are based on Small World graph of
Watts and Strogats [9], which is the simplest model for small-world. By simulation of some link redirection
processes, the models with community structure and small-world properties were generated. In addition, algorithm

for community recognition in social networks is proposed, which differ from others by networks small-world nature
utilizing.
2. Extended Watts and Strogatz (EWS) model
In a social network two nodes linked to the same node most probably linked too. To describe this phenomenon
clustering coefficient was introduced [9]. Let a node neighbors Ni be a set of nodes linked to the node number i.
Clustering coefficient (CC) of node i is a ratio of number of links in Ni to maximum number of links in a graph with
size | Ni |. CC of a network is the clustering coefficient of nodes averaged over network. The small-world is a
network with clustering coefficient significantly bigger than one in a random graph with the same size, but having a
small average distance between nodes, approximately the same as that of a random graph.
The simplest model of small-world was proposed by Watts and Strogatz [9] and is called Small World graph. It is
generated starting with a regular grid and redirecting part p of the links randomly. The grid has each node linked to
its z neighbors (usually the grid is depicted as a ring). It has a big CC but also a big
average distance. If p is small (~ 0.05..0.3), the graph has a small average distance but
the CC is big. This is Small World graph. If p is close to 1, the graph becomes a
random one.
However this graph has no community structure. From the link topology point of
view, community is a sub graph which has a bigger density of inner community links
than the density of between communities links [6].
Let us consider a set of M grids. By redirecting the pin fraction of links uniformly at
random inside the grid and the pout fraction of links between the grids, the extended
Fig.1. EWS graph.
Watts and Strogats (EWS) model is created. There are exactly M communities in the
model, the communities disappear with pout increasing. The small-world property of
the model disappears with pout or pin increasing. The model for M=3 is depicted on Fig.1.
To simulate other social network properties, it is useful to create EWS graph in reverse order, starting with
random graph GR. Inversed to randomization, operation I(M) on graph GR starts with nodes labeling by M different
community labels. With probability 1- pin- pout each link is redirected to be a part of greed pattern inside a
community. With probability pin a link is redirected to by an inner community random link and with probability pout
to be intercommunity random link. The result of I(MÂGR is a EWS graph. The I(M) operation preserves graph size,
so it is defined by GR size.
3. Hierarchical communities (HC) model
In social networks there exists a hierarchy of communities such that each community consists of sub
communities; a sub community has its sub communities, and so on till some level h. To generate a structured graph,
lets introduce community collapsing operator C. Graph CÂG is obtained from G by communities collapsing to a
single node. If a graph G consists of M communities, graph CÂG has M nodes linked by the between community
links of G (duplicated links in CÂG graph are redirected by following I-operation). Collapsed graph may be restored
to previous form by C-1 operator. For this purpose the inner structure of communities is preserved for each node of
collapsed graph, and, between-communities links are assigned to the restored community nodes randomly.
Let {M1,M2,..,Mh} be a set integers equal to of number of community on each level of hierarchy. To generate a
small-world network with desired community hierarchy GHC it is enough to do:
GHC=C-h+1ÂI(M1) Â[&Â,(M2@Â Â[&Â,(Mh@ÂGR .

An obtained graph is self-similar if Mk+1=μÂMk, where μ>1 is the average branching number in a hierarchal tree.

4. Communities recognition in small-world networks
Because social network is a small-world, it is interesting to utilize this property for community recognition. The
proposed method invokes link weighting based on the link participants in local links correlation. Inter-community
links are perceived as not correlated or weak correlated.
We define that the weight of a link in network is proportional to the number of common neighbours in its
neighbourhood. For a link connecting nodes v1, v2 we define the link weight E as:

E (v1 , v2 )

N (v1 )  N (v2 )

(2)

N (v1 )  N (v2 )

where N (v) is the neighborhood of the node v. Observe that 0 d E d 1 .
Two adjacent nodes v1, v2 belong to the same community if the weight of their connecting link is bigger than
some threshold value, which is a parameter of the algorithm,
E(v1, v2 ) > D,
where D is the level of the community separation for a graph. Notice that non-adjacent nodes belong to the same
community if there exists a path L connecting v1 to v2 such that each link in L has a bigger weight than the threshold
value. The simplest way for community recognition is to remove all the links with weight below D . But we propose
another approach, which we consider as more applicable.
Iterated Community Recognition Algorithm (ICRA):
Input: graph G=(V,E), level of community separation D;
Output: communities {V1, V2,.., Vk};
Start:
i=0
Loop while V is not empty
i++
Find an arbitrary community A in the graph G[V] induced by V.
Vi=A;
V=V-A;
k=i
End.
Algorithm for finding an arbitrary community:
Input: graph G=(V,E);
Output: a community A  G .
Start:
Put arbitrary node v  V into queue Q;
Loop while Q is not empty
get node u from Q; add u to A;
Loop for each w N (u) , w  C, Q
If E (u, w) ! D put w into Q End If
End.
The average computational complexity of ICRA is zÂ2Â|E|, where z is average nodes degree
The method was tested in EWS and HC models. For different model parameters the fraction of nodes pcorrect
which were correctly classified by the method as belonging to community was calculated by simulation. The pcorrect
value is near 100% for pout or pin less than some critical value pc and it sharply decreases with ongoing
randomization (see Fig. 2). The pc value is near the same for pout and pin, and it increases from approximately 25% to
70% with increasing z from 6 to 16. Other parameters of the model show a weak effect on pc.

It is important to notice that pc is
the critical value for the clustering
coefficient also. Thus the simulations
show the strong ability of the method
for community recognition in the case
of small-world network only. Even if
there are communities which may be
recognized by other methods, absence
of small-world property makes ICRA
inapplicable.

5. Conclusion
An algorithm for generating
synthetic network with close to real
social network properties was
developed and tested. It may be used
for farther researches both as a base
Fig. 2. pcorrect as function of pin ( pout=6%) and pout (pin=6%). z=8, M=16.
for practical algorithms benchmarks
and as a model for social processes
simulations. The models proposed in this paper have significant advantage in comparison to previous [6,7], because
these are small-world networks with community structure.
The main disadvantages of the model are an absence of a power law distribution (PLD) of nodes degree and not
exact simulation of the community size distribution. PLD may be simulated by redirecting random part of links with
probability proportional to the degree of nodes (in contrast to absolutely random in the paper). It was shown [5] that
this is enough to achieve a PLD. A variety of community sizes may be easily achieved by labeling the required
number of nodes as community member. But these additions will increase the model's complexity and number of
model parameters, which is better to avoid. In the proposed model there are only few parameters: network size, pout,
pin and number of communities on each level of hierarchy.
An algorithm for community recognition in social networks was proposed. It is interesting to test different
algorithms for community recognition (see [6,8,10]) in framework of these models, which will be done soon.
