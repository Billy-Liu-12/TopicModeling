Reduction of a detailed Biological Signaling Model
Dagmar Iber

Abstract
Biological signaling is complex. Even if only few components are involved models for biological signaling, in
general, comprise a large number of variables and parameters to achieve predictive power. This is due to the many
states that can be attained even with few components due to the formation of (allosteric) complexes. This phenomenon
is generally referred to as combinatorical complexity. Although the detailed parameterized and validated models can
be analysed to reveal regulatory principles these models are, in general, too complex to achieve an intuitive understanding. Methods are urgently needed to achieve meaningful model reduction. Ideally, biologists would like models
that retain the simplicity of the typical signaling cartoon, yet provide novel insight. We suggest a 2-step process to
achieve this. In a ﬁrst step a large detailed model is developed and tested based on experimental data. In a second step
the detailed information gained from the validated model is used to develop a realistic phenomenological model. The
procedure is illustrated by example of σF activation during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. The reduced model indeed
successfully reproduces key regulatory aspects of the detailed model and shows how the the exceptional sensitivity of
the regulatory network results from the particular allosteric interactions between SpoIIAB (AB), SpoIIAA (AA), and
σF and from the sequestration of AB in inactive AB-ADP-AA complexes.

1. Introduction
With the rise of Computational and Systems Biology much eﬀort is spent on the development of detailed, predictive models for cellular signaling networks. While detailed, quantitative models are necessary to understand the
principles of initiation, propagation and integration of cellular signaling their size and complexity limits the analysis
and prohibits an intuitive understanding. Much eﬀort is therefore spent on the development of methods for eﬃcient
model reduction [1, 2, 3, 4]. Standard methods from applied mathematics such as the separation of scales do not work
well for biological signaling models where most processes happen on a similar time and spatial scale. An alternative
is the grouping and lumping of reactions based on a sensitivity analysis. More often than not the generated models
are, however, not biological meaningful.
In general, biologists have simple cartoons to explain the basic signaling logic of the network of interest (Fig.
1). Such cartoons, in general, focus on the most relevant reactions but neglect the combinatoric complexity that

arises from complex formation and from allosteric interactions. Ideally, biologists would like models that are as
simple as these cartoons (with few extensions where necessary), yet provide novel insight. In order to parameterize
and validate models it is, in general, necessary to develop much more detailed models, mainly because a model
remains arbitrary unless it is based entirely on elementary reactions. For instance, while allosteric binding interactions
can be approximated by Hill functions it is often diﬃcult to justify the steepness of the Hill function. Without
detailed modeling the impact of known regulatory interactions may therefore be overestimated and further regulatory
interactions may be overlooked. We therefore propose to build phenomenological models based on a previously
developed and validated detailed model. In spite of intense modeling eﬀorts there are currently only few signaling
networks for which quantitative predictive models exist. One such detailed, quantitative model has been built for
the σF signaling network which regulates sporulation in Bacillus subtilis[5]. The detailed model comprises about 50
states and 150 reactions.
The model describes the molecular interactions that control the activity of the transcription factor σF during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 1A), a well-studied model system for cell diﬀerentiation [6]. The regulatory network
responds rapidly (within 10 minutes) to small changes in the input signal, yet the regulated process is impressively
robust to molecular noise [7]. How such level of control can be achieved with only three regulatory proteins has
long been an open question and could only be resolved by detailed modeling [5]. σF is kept inactive by binding
to an allosteric kinase, SpoIIAB (AB) [8]. Additional binding of the kinase’s substrate, SpoIIAA (AA), triggers a
conformational change which lowers the aﬃnity for σF and leads to the release of the transcription factor. SpoIIAA is
subsequently phosphorylated by SpoIIAB and must be dephosphorylated by SpoIIE (IIE) for reactivation. Rebinding
of σF to AB is prevented, in particular, by the formation of long-lived complexes between AA and AB that has not
yet exchanged ADP for ATP in its nucleotide-binding pocket and which therefore cannot phosphorylate and release
AA. The balance between SpoIIAB and SpoIIE activity thus determines the activity of the transcription factor σF .
This balance is perturbed when the bacterium undergoes asymmetric cell division in response to starvation and the
phosphatase IIE accumulates on (both sides of) the asymmetrically positioned septum [9]. This results in an increase
in the IIE concentration in the smaller prespore and a slightly reduced IIE concentration in the larger mother cell.
Moreover, because the phosphatase rate is low, most IIE is bound by its substrate AA-P such that both the phosphatase
and its substrate accumulate together in the prespore [5]. As a consequence suﬃcient AA is formed to trigger σF
release speciﬁcally in the prespore. The restriction of σF release to the prespore therefore is the consequence of the
volume diﬀerence between prespore and mother cell [5]; other eﬀects such as the transient genetic imbalance [10, 11]
have only little or no eﬀect [8].
In summary, the input signal, an at least 2.5-fold increase in the concentration of SpoIIE, results in rapid σF
activation because of
1. the particular allosteric mechanism with which SpoIIAB binds σF and AA
2. the formation of long-lived complexes between AA and ADP-bound AB
3. the low phosphatase rate
A simple, phenomenological model that considers only the key regulatory interactions of the typical signaling cartoon
used by biologists (Fig. 1B) should achieve the observed sensitivity by only including the above three eﬀects. We test
this by developing and analysing the corresponding phenomenological model.
2. The Model
The detailed model of the sporulation network comprises about 50 dependent variables and 150 reactions [5].
There is no straightforward, generic way of reducing this system of equations to three key states because there is
no separation of timescales. However, biologists typically consider σF (s), ATP-bound AB (b), ADP-bound AB
(bd ), AA (a), phosphorylated AA (a p ), and σF -AB complexes (c) as the six most important components (Fig. 1).
We therefore seek to develop a simple model that comprises only these components, yet adequately describes σF
activation. Based on the detailed model and in agreement with experimental data we know that upon septation protein

expression becomes negligible. Equally, protein degradation does not play a role on the timescale (10 minutes) on
which σF becomes active. Accordingly the total concentrations of σF , AB and AA are conserved, and we have
sT = s + c = const,

bT = b + c + bd = const,

aT = a + a p = const.

(1)

We can therefore fully describe the dynamics of the system by considering only three instead of six dependent variables. The detailed model is large and complex mainly because of the cooperative binding of AB to its ligands and
because of the many diﬀerent ADP- or ATP bound complexes of AB. Cooperativity results in a non-linear step-like

functional forms to model such a step response. We then obtain the following set of coupled diﬀerential equations to

Thus a is produced at rate k3 from phosphorylated AA, a p = aT − a. The concentration of the phosphatase IIE is
part of the maximal reaction velocity k3 . While a Michaelis-Menten mechanism would describe this reaction more
accurately we prefer the simplest possible description. a is removed by binding to σF -bound AB at rate k1 . A Hill

be in quasi-steady state relative to the other network reactions. While we know from the detailed model that such
a separation of timescales does not apply this simpliﬁcation can be used because we will only analyse the steady
state behavior of the model. In summary, we have formulated a simple model based on the typical cartoon used by
biologists and based on insights gained from the detailed quantitative model that we previously analysed.
To facilitate the analysis of the model we reduce it to a dimensionless form by writing

The estimates for η and ζ follow from the experimental observation that just before septation aT ∼ 3×sT and bT ∼ 1.5×
sT [12, 13, 14]. Similarly k˜ 11 = k11 bT t0 = 10 follows from the experimental σF -AB·ATP on-rate k11 = 4 × 105 M−1 s−1
and bT ∼ 25 × 10−6 M [15, 13]. k1 represents the maximal rate of AA-dependent σF ·AB·ATP dissociation which,
based on ﬂuorescence quenching results, we have determined before as k1 = 0.4 s−1 [5]. k2 represents the rate limiting
steps in the AB ADP-ATP exchange reaction which experiments deﬁne as 1 s−1 [16]. We have previously determined
the in vivo phosphatase rate as 0.0087 s−1 and the IIE-AA-P on-rate as 105 M−1 s−1 . The IIE concentration is about 15
μM at the time of septation [13] such that the eﬀective on-rate is 105 M−1 s−1 × 15 × 10−6 M × t0 = 1.5. Consequently
the phosphatase reaction is rate limiting and most IIE is bound by its substrate AA-P [5]. We therefore have k3 ∼ 0.01
and any increase in IIE and AA-P will result in an increase in k3 . M1 -M3 corresponds to the aﬃnity constant of the
AB-AA interaction, which has been estimated as Kd ∼ 50 nM [14]. We further have aT ∼ 2bT ∼ 50μM [14] such that
m1 = m2 = m3 = 0.001. In the following the tildes are dropped for better readability.
3. Results
3.1. A steady-state analysis of the reduced model
We are now in the position to analyse the response of the steady states of this simple model to changes in the
phosphorylation rate k3 . An advantage of a simple 3-component network is that we can carry out a phase plane

analysis. The phase plane contains three important sets of information: the nullclines on which one variable does not
change in time, the steady states where non of the variable changes in time (the intersection of all nullclines), and the
velocity vector ﬁeld. The last bit of information is particularly important as it indicates where the system will evolve
to from a given point in the phase plane. We determine the nullclines of (2-4) by setting the time derivatives to zero,

Figure 2 shows the a- and c-nullclines in the physiologically meaningful subset (a, c ∈ [0, 1]) of the a − c-plane
where b˙ = 0. The steady states are at the intersection of the nullclines. The directions of the velocity vectors (the ﬁelds
have not been included for better readability) show that the outer two steady states are stable while the intermediate
steady state is unstable (Fig. 2A). As we increase the phosphatase rate k3 two of the steady states disappear (Fig. 2B).
The bifurcation diagram in panel C conﬁrms the bistability of the network. Thus for small k3 there is only one steady
state with c∗ close to one, and this steady state is stable. For larger k3 a second stable steady state with c∗ close to
zero and an unstable steady state emerge. The two stable steady states co-exist only in a narrow range of k3 -values.
For even larger k3 the steady state with c∗ close to one disappears and the steady state with c∗ close to zero is attained.
We conclude that the dynamical system exhibits hysteresis (Fig. 2D), i.e. when k3 is either increased or decreased the
dynamical system changes between the lower and the higher steady state value for c at two diﬀerent k3 -values (Fig.
2D, note the two diﬀerent places at which the switch occurs). As a consequence the septation-dependent switch is
robust to ﬂuctuations in k3 because c∗ will remain close to zero even if k3 is subsequently slightly reduced.
3.2. Hysteresis and bistability require stable AB-AA complex formation
In order to obtain hysteresis the formation of stable AB-AA complexes is of key importance. This can be seen by
a, i = 1, 2, 3). We then have

There is only one steady state and consequently the system cannot exhibit bistability or hysteresis (Fig. 2C, grey line).
Without stable complex formation between AA and AB the mechanism is therefore not robust to ﬂuctuations in the
rate of dephosphorylation.
3.3. The AB-ADP-AA sink enhances the sensitivity of the network
We have incorporated stable interactions between AA and AB at several places in the model, if indirectly with
phenomenological approximations. To understand the relevance of these complexes we determine the bifurcation diagrams when these terms are removed. To remove the AA-dependent sequestration of AB-ADP in inactive complexes
we only need to change the equation for b and we obtain

The nullclines are now given by Eqs. 10 & 14, with L = k11 k2 m2 , W = k11 ζm2 , and A = k2 (a + m2 ) + W. While the
lack of AB sequestration can clearly be compensated for by the formation of AB-ATP-AA complexes (Fig. 3A, green
lines), we notice that if the ADP-ATP exchange reaction is the only one to be limited by AB-AA complex formation
then the network achieves the highest sensitivity to changes in k3 , and the network then responds to the physiological
parameter range of k3 (Fig. 3D). We conclude that to achieve the highest sensitivity we require AA binding to ADPbound AB while a competition between AA and σF for binding to AB rather lowers the sensitivity to changes in the
phosphatase rate (Fig. 3B,C).
3.4. The role of AB allostery
AB is diﬀerent from most other previously studied allosteric proteins in that it has two ligands whose aﬃnities
are both modulated by the conformational change. Thus not only the AA · AB aﬃnity increases upon binding of AA
but the σF · AB aﬃnity also decreases. Without such regulation s and b would not rapidly unbind when a binds to
the complex c. To explore such behaviour we need to introduce a further intermediate state d, in which b is bound
by both s and a (Fig. 1D & 4A). Because dissociation of d is now slow (k4 ), we also need to consider a-independent

Without an AA-induced reduction in the AB-σF aﬃnity no eﬀective control of σF activity can be obtained (Fig.

of a, i.e. for small k3 (Fig. 4, black line). Only if the AB-σF dissociation rate increases in response to AA binding

σF dissolution by means of a sophisticated allosteric binding mechanism is therefore key to ultrasensitivity and the

4. Discussion
The extraction of reduced, yet meaningful models from large, detailed models is a challenging yet important
problem in computational biology. Current methods, in general, start with a large detailed model and proceed by the
grouping and lumping of reactions according to some optimization criteria that penalize large deviations in the chosen
model output [1, 2, 3, 4]. More often than not are the resulting reduced models diﬃcult to interpret. We chose a
diﬀerent route in that instead of reducing the detailed model we started with the topology of the target network model
and formulated the reaction kinetics so as to capture the eﬀects of regulatory interactions that were not included
explicitly in the model.
This approach successfully generated a realistic, phenomenological model that could capture key regulatory aspects (sensitivity of the steady states to the input signal) and that could identify at which step the not explicitly included
stable interactions between AA and AB were most important. The simple model revealed that the sensitive response
of the transcription factor to small changes in the activity of the phosphatase IIE required only
1. formation of long-lived complexes between AA and AB
2. AB allostery and inverse changes in the binding aﬃnities for σF and AA in response to AA-induced conformational changes in AB.
Competition between AA and σF for AB binding reduced the sensitivity of the model. In fact, based on kinetic data we
previously predicted that σF rebinding to AB after nucleotide exchange would be favoured compared to the binding
of AA because σF can bind while the nucleotide lid is still open and induce its closure [5]. The low phosphatase rate
that proved to be important in the detailed model ensures that a change in the IIE concentration translates into a direct
change in k3 [5]. This is captured only indirectly in this model in that we require a change in k3 that is similar to the
increase in the IIE concentration that is obtained in response to septation in the bacterium to achieve σF activation.
The analysis of the simple model thus reveals how an ultrasensitive switch can be generated from a single allosteric
protein with only two subunits. According to the well-established theory on allostery, dimeric proteins can enable only
limited sensitivity because the Hill coeﬃcient is no larger than two [18]. This limitation is overcome by a combination
of two sophisticated mechanisms: the allosteric protein binds two ligands with inversely related aﬃnities in its two
conformations, and the allosteric protein can be sequestered in an inactive form. The inversely related aﬃnities enable
the switch-like displacement of the transcription factor σF in response to the septation-dependent increase in the
competing ligand AA, while the sequestration reaction ensures that σF is kept oﬀ and does not rebind AB.
Bistability and hysteresis are important to achieve reliable cell fate decisions and these are therefore general
characteristics of regulatory networks that govern cell diﬀerentiation [19, 20]. Remarkable about the network that
controls σF activity is its small size (4 proteins) and high sensitivity. The same network topology can be found also in
other bacterial signaling pathways such as the general stress response of gram-positive bacteria [21], and mitochondria
have proteins with homology to AB [22, 23]. This simple network architecture is therefore likely to represent a rather
widely used mechanism to obtain robust bistability and ultrasensitivity in small protein networks. It will be interesting
to see whether similar network architectures are also employed in higher organisms.
