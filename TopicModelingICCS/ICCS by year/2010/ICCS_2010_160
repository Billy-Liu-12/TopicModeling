1. Introduction
Organizing the navigation of river boats in a difficult geometry harborage or long deflecting river without line-ofsight raises some problems in spite of “rules of the road” existence. In addition, inexperienced skippers may want to
have some kind of “adviser” for correct selection of speed, fairway, etc., besides, they need to have granted access to
updated navigation maps and current local weather forecast. In other words, there is necessity in creating service for
controlling navigation of river boats and total control of harborage or river, forecasting the situation and giving
advices to participants, and organizing link for them to Rescue Service. This is also recommended by the 12th Rule
Chapter 5 of International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Resolution A.857 (20) of the
Convention on the International Maritime Organization, IALA Guide.[2] There is a large variety of such systems in
a market now, but all of them require expensive equipment: onboard radiolocation system, sonic depth-finder,
portable weather station, laptop and may be some other devices. Total cost of them may be comparable with average
price of little river boats. Moreover, all this devices needs AC supply and a lot of free space in a pilot-house. We
want to create a different system, based on harborage services, Global Positioning and modern wireless
technologies. Skippers have to own nothing more than a modern mobile phone, HPC or an old laptop - all necessary
information will be sent to it.
2. System description
For the large vessels there are a lot of such services and devices with resembling functionality, and more are
creating now, but there is no cheap solution for small river boats, at the same time there is a law restriction for
navigation in North-West Region of Russia in case of line-of-sight less than 1.8 kilometer and ship doesn’t have

radio locator, which means that such services should be accessible from the cheapest user devices, affordable for
most of river boats skippers.
As a cheapest solution for determination of position should be chosen global positioning systems: NAVSTAR
GPS, GLONASS or GALILEO [4-6]. Average error for that systems position is about 6-11 meters without GNSS
Augmentation and less than 3 meter with it. (There is no such system in most part of Russian Federation). While
using two linked systems (GNSS and radiolocation service) average error is less than 10 meters in 95% of time.

Fig. 1. Base principle.

As you can see at the first picture – client has a link to any ground service: map update, rescue and radiolocation
from one simple device via one connection to the service’s server, which collects and operates all information about
harborage.
Pocket devices with information from such systems can give relatively precise coordinates and current speed.
Skipper knows his boats base dimensions (extreme length, beam athwart ship, draught) and it’s abilities for
maximum speed, radius of a turning, braking in dead water (such characteristics may be measured by our service
and navigation device). All this information can be measured, calculated and stored in simple and cheap
multifunctional device: netbook, Smartphone and etc. Moreover all that devices have their own easily expandable
battery and don’t depend on any on-board equipment.
For information transferring we may use different channels: from cellular operator services (low speed – less than
4 Mbit/sec, expansive in use for participants, but very cheap devices) to creating WiMax network [3] on all
harborage (speed is less than 75 Mbit/sec, but more expansive devices for users, more expansive building network –
1 data station for 1 to 10 kilometers).
Base principle of operation for client’s point of view is simple and very similar to usual navigation with GPS
system: after determination of current position user sets the destination point and choosing route, starting automatic
downloading updates for the maps with skippers route and another one – recommended by system which had been
built with the information about current situation in harborage. Skipper begins sailing being linked to service and
transferring his movement information, receiving advices about speed/course, warnings about approaching with
other ships or dangerous objects and etc.
Client software for such service may be created practically on any modern mobile OS: WinMobile, Android,

Symbian… For netbooks may be used cross platform frameworks for compatibility with Windows, Linux, MacOs.
For saving privacy all transferring data must be encrypted and in server-side deleting all personal information,
showing in maps of other participants only as marker with course/speed. Most part of calculating compute in servers
of service for decreasing end-user hardware requirement.

Client has abilities to use great number for connecting to the service:
• TCP-IP over GPRS/EDGE/WiMax (solid lines);
• Voice call – to call centre, where he could be switched to Rescue service (dash line);
• VoIP call – to call center (dots line).
Web site gives clients an opportunity to analyze current situation in harborage, to study a weather forecasts, to
view the harborage maps, schedulers and navigation rules. It also has a user registration area, software distribution
part, and some services for registered clients only: map updates, their previous routes, tools for creating new routes
with sending it to the user’s mobile device and etc.
Application server is a set of services, which can be used by user over TCP-IP by our programs from its mobile
device or laptop: receiving user’s coordinates, sending weather updates for user’s current location, sending map
updates with other ships marks, creating routes and simulate them in agent test area, sending recommendation and
warnings to user while navigating.
Web site and applications server connects to main service server; it is a single computer with some services and
Oracle Database now, but it will be transformed to cluster for normal operating: database server with backup
service, test area server – for creating virtual model of harborage and simulating client agents navigations, servers
for updating maps and clients positions with connections to geoinformation and radiolocation services.
For futures upgrades server system is being created scalable and in modular style. We think that it would consist
of that module set:
• Module for user request replying;
• Data Storing module – based on modern DBMS;
• Geoinformation system link module;
• Module for linking to Rescue Service;
• Radiolocation service link module for additional control on participants movements;
• Multiagent system module for creating forecasts of situations and giving advices for skippers;
• Interface module for service operators.

Fig. 3. Interaction in the service.

At the picture number 3 you can see a module linking scheme. Central unit – is a Dispatcher: it controls
information rotation in the system, have operator’s interfaces, client’s gates, ensure security.
3. Base operations principle of the service
Client (skipper) downloads or updates information about harborage and sets route or just determines current
position and sets the destination point; fills/measures the list of his boat specifications. All that information encrypts
and transfers to service servers, where it would be tested and putted into multiagent system which modeling
harborage [1]. Starts the analyzer of skippers route and developing new route (if needed). Route tests of “rules of
the road” of Russian Rescue Ministry, after that skippers receives granting to start moving or recommendations for
new route, which automatically downloading into his device.
Skippers receive recommendations while moving on choosing speed, necessary changing the course. If deviation
more than selected limit, user receives warning and recommendations how to come back to previously created route.
If there is sharp deviation or situation in harborage strongly changed skipper’s route send back to multiagent system,
for preventing alert conditions, and user receives warnings with additional information and recommendations with
new route.
Skipper also can use link to Rescue service: all information about his boat, his location and interface for voice
channel to boat would be send to rescue service.
In case of dysfunction user’s device or of skipper doesn’t have it at all, this boat takes the bearing by ground
radar set of harborage navigation system, and information about it adding to model of harborage.
A skipper always receives actual updated maps, weather forecast and so on in one simple device because of that
service.

4. Structure of Multiagent system module
That module has access to map of harborage information, updates for them and all weather forecasts. Weather
has an influence on recommendation for choosing speed and etc, more over if the weather forecast is too bad system
makes risk weighting of navigating in such conditions for each boat.

Fig. 4. Process interaction on Agent level.
At the forth picture here is a scheme of Agent abilities of operating: it receives information from Dispatcher,
looks for information about the world in Test area module, where it also can see routes of other boats, and checks its
own route in Rules module.
For each client of service system create an “agent” in testing area of harborage with appropriating real client boat
specifications, it’s speed, course and position. After that system makes a rapid simulation of walking the whole route
by client’s boat with rescue safety test and being up to rules of navigating in this harborage. In a case of success
simulation the route and speed plan loading into a memory of client’s device and into agent memory, agent become
a real participant of navigation in test area, and information of it’s future moving become public and accountable by
other agents. The movements in simulation for this agent make from this moment on every system time slice.
If the simulation faults, system tries to create a new route automatically for making results of new rapid
simulation successful. In a case of negative result, skipper would be informed about troubles with description of
situation and asking for his decisions. Skipper also can ask service operator or rescue officer for help.
Deviations from created route and speed plan are inevitable while navigating, and this “updates” are being loaded
into agent model. When deviation becomes more that the limit, skipper receives a warning and advices to change
route/speed. If deviation growths again, system makes a new rapid simulation for creating a new route for that agent.
Agents, whose routes have to be changed because of new agents or changed weather, receives a task for rapid
simulation for creating new routes and sending alerts to their skippers. System deletes agents after end of their
routes.

5. Results
Proposed system is a cheap solution for inexperienced skippers and has abilities to decrease risk of navigation in
rivers and harborages. It’s more timely in accordance with a usually bad weather, little line-of-sight in the most part
of north-west Russian territory and growing number of private river boats. We’ve presented base concepts of our
system at this article. Creating these modules is being doing right now; we are creating the link from virtual map to
real map from geoinformation services, the software interfaces to client devices. Oracle DB server was chosen as a
main Data Storage and calculation center. Major portion of agent system and polygon services are being
programmed in PLSQL modules with using object tables. Client software was tested in Windows Mobile 6.0
operation system on device with 200 MHz CPU, 64 Mb RAM and built-in GPS module. Current price for such
device is about $300. Extra charge for skipper – charge to cellular operator for mobile internet traffic and, may be,
some monthly fee for accessing the service.
