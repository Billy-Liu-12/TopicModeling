Abstract
The mathematical model of solid-phase chemical reaction propagation in a plate under mechanical loading is suggested. Uniaxial
tension, shearing and anchorage of the plate edges are considered. The problem is solved in two-dimensional definition.
Parametric investigation of the model is carried out. Stress and strain field evolution is investigated. Influence of coupling
between the fields of temperature, concentration and stress on the chemical conversion propagation is illustrated.

1. Introduction and physical problem definition
Initiation of a chemical conversion in a solid body by external action always leads to stress field appearance. The
reasons of it are different: nonuniformity of matter heating, inhomogeneity of matter structure, differences between
specific volumes of reactants and reaction products or mismatch of their structure and so on. Thus if an external
source is a thermal one, some part of heat is spent on deformation which leads to heating-up delaying and reducing
the reaction rate. If external source is a mechanical impulse, then relaxation of stresses besides matter destruction
and generation of structure defects is accompanied by the heat release. Both effects follow from coupling of
temperature and strain fields. One of the ways which let us change combustion properties and regulate the structure
of reaction products is the action of constant load on gas-free mixture burning in mold. The load may determine
process behavior, hasten or decelerate the conversion, change the kinetics of structure formation processes.
Influence of stresses on the rate of elastically strained bonds rupture reaction, k, is described by Eyring-Kozman
equation [1]

Investigations of solid-phase chemical conversions under mechanical loading started several decades ago. Such
authors as O.B. Kovalev, V.V. Boldyrev, N.S. Enikolopyan and some others made a considerable contribution to
this field of science, but most of their works are experimental ones. And still there is a lack of mathematical models
describing these processes. No models taking into account coupling effect in chemical transformations were found
in publications.
The present paper presents the model of solid-phase chemical reaction under mechanical loading which takes into
account variation of conversion rate because of the action of stresses. Two types of external loading are considered:
uniaxial tension and shearing. Besides that, the anchorage of plate edges was also investigated. Kinetics equation
takes into account the fact that there are two main ways of chemical reaction initiation: changing internal energy
(temperature) and producing work. Thus the function of chemical heat release takes the form

Fig. 1. illustrates the problem definition. It is supposed that the sample is a stationary thin plate from a reactive
material. The plate length is Lx, the width is Ly and the height is Lz, Lz << Lx, Lz << Ly. In case of uniaxial tension the
distributed loading of the value ıɯɯ=P is applied to the plate faces x=0 and x=Lx. The direction of the load coincides
with Ox axis. In case of shearing loading ıxy=P is applied to the plate perimeter. In case of the plate anchorage all its
edges are fixed.
Exothermic chemical reaction which may be described with a simple total scheme AĺB spreads in the direction
of Ox axis. It is considered that the melting temperature is not reached and the whole reaction progresses in a solid
phase. Such requirement is a necessary condition of some materials synthesis technologies. As far as the mechanical
disturbances propagation velocity is much greater than the solid-phase chemical reaction propagation rate, inertial
forces were neglected in the first approximation. Heat exchange with the environment was not taken into account.
Mechanical moduluses of the material (E, Ȝ) are considered to be constant during the whole process.

2. Mathematical problem definition and nomenclature
As far as Lz is much less than Lx and Ly, let's proceed to the generalized plane stress approximation [2]. In such
case the system of stress equilibrium equations takes the form

Physical interpretation of these values is as follows: į – the coefficient of coupling between heat transfer and
deformation processes, ıT – the ratio of initial temperature to heat warming up, ș0 – Zel'dovich number, A – the
coefficient of reaction rate sensitivity to the work of stresses, ȕ – the small parameter, characterizing reaction rate
sensitivity to temperature, g – relative volume change in the process of chemical conversion (ratio of concentration
deformation to the thermal one), q0 – external heat flux intensity; Lȟ – dimensionless plate length, LȘ –
dimensionless plate width.
Notation conventions: ȜT – heat conductivity factor, c – heat capacity, ȡ – density (in the general case all physical
properties depend on porosity), Q – thermal effect of chemical reaction, q0 – heat flow density. “0” index denotes
initial conditions.

which was reproduced numerically accurate within 1 %.
2) Temperature is constant, no chemical reaction. In case of uniaxial tension maximum stress values ( s kk P )
are located on loading surfaces and decrease deep into the plate, stress field is symmetrical with respect to line

After program testing the distributions of temperature, conversion degree, stress and strain tensor components in
various points of time were calculated; surface temperature evolution, mean conversion degree and chemical
reaction propagation velocity were analyzed in the course of numerical investigation of the problem.
Maximum temperature during the whole process was obtained on the plate surface ȟ=0. Increase of the
coefficient of reaction rate sensitivity to the work of stresses leads to its insignificant growth in the beginning of the
process. In case of uniaxial tension the temperature maximum is formed on the plate’s axis of symmetry Ș=LȘ/2 with
the course of time, and in case of shearing the maximum temperature point migrateV DORQJ WKH OLQH ȟ=0 in the

Comparing the curves 2 on fig. 2 one can see that shearing as the type of external load leads to more rapid
chemical conversion in regard to uniaxial tension, which is detected in many experimental researches. One should
expect greater effect using the models which take into account dynamic phenomena.

As follows from fig. 5, in case of the plate anchorage neither taking into account the coupling effect, nor varying
the sensitivity coefficient can influence the chart. But for other types of loading such influence is essential.
Parameter g, which characterizes the volume change during the conversion, has a strong effect on process
dynamics. If g>0, the conversion progresses with volume expansion, if g<0 – with volume contraction.
Fig. 6 shows changing of “sigma-epsilon” charts according to different values of parameter g.
It was found out that varying the parameter which is related to chemical reaction, it is possible to obtain
qualitatively different dependencies between mean stresses and mean strains. Thus if g<0 curve 3 resembles creep
curve though the problem was solved within the scope of elastic statement.

4. Conclusion
Two-dimensional mathematical model describing the influence of various types of external loading on the solidphase chemical conversion in a plate was suggested. The model takes into account interrelations between the
mechanical stresses and the chemical conversion (heat release in reaction and differences between specific volumes
of reagent and reaction product). The algorithm of numerical investigation of the model was developed. Parametric
investigation of the model was carried out. It was found out that the stresses and strains appearing in the process of
conversion play an important role in the dynamics of the process. The influence of loading conditions on chemical
conversion in the plate was shown. The model is to be updated. The authors are going to work further on taking into
account dependences of physical properties on the temperature and conversion degree. Another area of work will
include introducing more complicated chemical kinetics. The ideas of the work will be developed and used for
simulation of SHS-extrusion of intermetallic compounds.
