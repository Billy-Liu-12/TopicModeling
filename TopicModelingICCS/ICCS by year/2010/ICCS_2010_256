Abstract
In this paper, we apply a Schwarz waveform relaxation method to a two-species reactive transport system. By
Fourier analysis we ﬁnd optimal coupling conditions that result in pseudo-diﬀerential operators. We approximate
these operators by diﬀerential operators and give an upper bound for the convergence rate. By this technique a best
approximation problem arises that is solved numerically. We ﬁnally obtain an optimised transmission condition that
we will analyse numerically.
This result is a ﬁrst important theoretical issue for the application of domain decomposition methods to large
coupled systems of reactive transport equations and has a great implication on the global performance of the numerical
approach.

1. Introduction
Reactive transport modelling is a basic tool for predicting and analysing the behaviour of coupled chemical processes. Having an integrated approach, one wants to create an integrated system with individual time and space
dependent subsystems that are related to each other. All those models have in common that they couple a mass transport system given by an advection-diﬀusion equation and a reactive system given by a non-linear system of equations
or a system of diﬀerential equations. Both systems have an impact on each other so they have to be solved at the
same time. An overview as well as diﬀerent methods of reactive transport modelling can be found in [1]. A more
mathematical approach of multi-species reactive transport models, especially reduction techniques, can be found in
[2].
The main objective of our work is to solve the diﬃculties arising in real test cases for the study and risk assessment
of CO2 storage. These simulations at reservoir and basin scales could involve dozens of chemical species, a few

million of cells over a time range of roughly 1000 years. They couple the compositional Darcy ﬂow of the three
aqueous, oil and gas phases together with the kinetic reactions of precipitation dissolution of the minerals and the
chemical equilibrium of the species in aqueous phase. A detailled description of CO2 geological storage processes in
deep saline aquifers may be found in [3].
In this context, simulations have shown that the inﬂuence of chemical reaction terms on time and space discretisation limitations are quite localised. One way to solve these diﬃculties is to isolate those regions and solve them
separately in order not to loose global performance. This invites to use domain decomposition techniques to solve
reactive transport problems.
In the last two decades, domain decomposition methods have proved to be a powerful tool for eﬃcient numerical
approaches of several classes of problems. A historical overview of the development of domain decomposition methods can be found in [4]. The choice of transmission conditions between diﬀerent sub-domains is a crucial issue for
the performance of the diﬀerent algorithms. A broad discussion can be found in the books [5, 6].
For evolution-type problems, Schwarz waveform relaxation methods are a class of domain decomposition methods
that allow to overcome global discretisation restrictions by splitting the computational domain into sub-domains that
can be solved independently. These sub-domains are solved in an iterative way and are ﬁnally coupled by appropriate
transmission conditions. The choice of transmission conditions is therefore a crucial issue in the study of these
methods. Diﬀerent transmission conditions and especially “optimised transmission conditions” have been studied
for several types of scalar equations as the heat equation (cf. [7]) or advection-reaction-diﬀusion type equations, see
[8, 9, 10, 11]. We study in this article the extension of these works to a coupled reactive-transport system of mobile
and ﬁxed species.
2. Problem setting
Our model problem is the following system of partial diﬀerential equations in Ω × [0, T ],
∂t (φu) + div(−a∇u + bu) −k(v − cu) = 0
∂t (φv)
+k(v − cu) = 0

on Ω × [0, T ]

on Ω × [0, T ],

(1)

where Ω ⊂ R2 , u(x, t) and v(x, t) are the concentrations of a mobile and a ﬁxed chemical species respectively. φ is
the porosity, a > 0 a diﬀusion-dispersion coeﬃcient, b = (b x , by ) a velocity ﬁeld, k = k(x, y) ≥ 0 is a reaction rate
depending on the reactive area and ﬁnally c > 0 is an equilibrium constant for the sorption reaction between u and v.
In order to deﬁne a well-posed problem, initial conditions u0 , v0 for u(x, 0), v(x, 0) as well as appropriate boundary
conditions on ∂Ω have to be added but, for sake of readability, we omit them.
As one can see, the mobile species u is transported by an advection-diﬀusion process while the ﬁxed species v is
not. Both species are coupled by a chemical reaction term that realises a mass exchange between each other. One
might interpret v as the sorbed part of u. We want to point out to the reader the opposite sign of the chemical source
term, therefore, beside the eﬀect of boundary conditions, no mass is created or annihilated, total mass is conserved.
On the one hand, this model is adequate to represent a huge class of linear reactive-transport processes. On the
other hand, it is suﬃciently simple in order to perform theoretical studies in our context.
3. Domain Decomposition Algorithm
Domain decomposition is a convenient way to split large problems in sub-problems. Diﬀerent algorithms are
available and we have chosen to apply an optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm. This choice has the
advantage that the resolution method as well as the time and space discretisations of the sub-problems are entirely
independent. As to our application, this might be a good choice since highly reactive regions can be treated separately
and the restrictions in terms of discretisation reﬁnement do not constrain surrounding regions.
We consider a numerical domain in space R2 and in time [0, ∞[. We deﬁne two overlapping sub-domains Ω− =
] − ∞, L] × R, Ω+ = [−L, +∞[×R with L ≥ 0 as well as the interfaces Γ12 = {x = L} × R, Γ21 = {x = −L} × R (cf.

An initial guess (u01 , v01 ) and (u02 , v02 ) has to be furnished in order to start the iteration. Now, the problems can be solved
separately in both sub-domains Ω1 and Ω2 provided that we deﬁne appropriate coupling operators B+ and B− on the
interfaces Γ12 and Γ21 . One might advise that the convergence rate of algorithm (2) is sensitively inﬂuenced by the
choice of the coupling conditions on the interfaces.
3.1. Fourier analysis and general convergence factor
For the following analysis we consider the coeﬃcients φ, a, b, k and c as constant. For convergence studies it is
convenient to pass from space domain to frequency domain by a Fourier transformation. We do so in y and t variables
and call ξ and τ their dual variables. System (1) writes then

ˆ −kˆv + kcˆu = 0
∂x + by i ξ u
φ i τˆv
+kˆv − kcˆu = 0.

(3)

Supposing φiτ + k 0, one can eliminate vˆ from the ﬁrst equation and it follows that uˆ is solution of a linear second
order ordinary diﬀerential equation. The roots of its characteristic polynomial are

(5)

Now, we deﬁne the errors of the domain decomposition algorithm as enu1 = un1 − u¯ 1 where un1 is the nth iterate
of algorithm (2) and u¯ 1 is the solution of (1) restricted to Ω1 . The other errors eu2 , ev1 and ev2 are deﬁned in the
same way. By linearity, one can see that the errors also verify the equations given by (2) together with the deﬁned

transmission conditions. The former results apply directly to eˆ nu1 and eˆ nu2 , moreover, as we work on sub-domains, using
a boundedness argument, one can deduce that
eˆ nu1 (x, ξ, τ) = C1n (ξ, τ) eλ (x−L)

eˆ nu2 (x, ξ, τ) = C2n (ξ, τ) eλ (x+L)

where C1n and C2n are functions depending on the problem parameters and the coupling operators.
3.2. Robin transmission conditions
In the following, we study diﬀerent transmission conditions of Robin type, i. e.

for a Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm (cf. [8]) where F(u) = −a ∂u
∂x + b x u is the ﬂux and n and n are the
+
−
outgoing normals of domains Ω and Ω respectively.
The expression of the errors deﬁned in (6), together with the recurrence relation of algorithm (2), allows us to
deﬁne the convergence rates ρn1 and ρn2 of the domain decomposition algorithm as
n+1
eˆ u1
= ρn1 eˆ n−1
u1
n+1
eˆ u2
= ρn2 eˆ n−1
u2 .

Using the symmetry of the problem and the transmission conditions deﬁned in (7), one proves that
ρn1 = ρn2 = ρ(ξ, τ) =

(b x + σ) − 2γ− (−b x + σ) − 2γ+ − 2L σ
·
e a .
(−b x + σ) + 2γ− (b x + σ) + 2γ+

In general, we have the property that the larger the overlap L, the faster the convergence. In practice, the overlap
is chosen as L ≈ Δx.
One can see that if we choose γ− = 12 (b + σ) and γ+ = 21 (−b + σ), then the algorithm converges in two iterations.
The problem of the optimal choice of γ− and γ+ is that the symbol σ is not a polynomial in ξ and τ. Therefore the
corresponding operator in space domain is a global pseudodiﬀerential operator that is hardly aﬀordable for implementation purpose. Hence, one is recommended to approximate it by a diﬀerential operator. The easiest way to do so is to
approximate the symbol σ by constants, i. e. to set γ+ = p+ and γ− = p− with p+ , p− ∈ R.
One may now ask for how to choose the free parameters p+ , p− and L? We show in the following part a way that
rises from a best approximation problem.
3.3. Parameter optimisation, theory and practice
For the following developments, we consider L as given and ﬁxed and study the optimisation of the single parameter p assuming p+ = p− = p. In order to have fast convergence of the domain decomposition algorithm we want to
minimise the convergence factor. A way to do so is to ﬁnd a parameter p such that the convergence factor is minimal
for all frequencies ξ, τ. This results in a best approximation problem of the type inf p supτ,ξ ρ(p, ξ, τ).

Note that in real cases we do not treat inﬁnite space domains, so the Fourier transform analysis may be adapted in this
case.
By a closer study of the convergence rate one can see that the inﬁmum is reached for p > 0 so we ﬁnally deﬁne

3.4. Ventcel transmission conditions
In section 3.2 we approximated σ by constants p± ∈ R. Another, more precise way is to approximate the square
root by an aﬃne polynomial in the variable part of σ2 . Finally, we set the Ventcel transmission conditions as:

As for Robin transmission conditions we can compute a formula for the convergence rate:
ρ(ξ, τ) =

This convergence rate may now be optimised by ﬁnding optimal real parameters

4. Numerical tests
In this section, we want to validate the theoretical results on a 1D prototype that uses an implicit Euler approximation in time and a weighted two-points (diﬀusion) and upwind (advection) ﬁnite volume scheme in space. We set
the test data to
t ∈ [0, T ]
T = 50
Δt = 1
x ∈ [−5, 5]
φ=1
k = 0.2

Δx = 0.1
a = 0.1
c = 0.5

b x = 0.2

u0 = v0 = 0
and set a Dirichlet condition of u = 1 for x = −5 and an advective outﬂowing condition with zero concentration
gradient for x = 5.
The ﬁrst test shows the performance of optimised Robin interface conditions compared to classical Dirichlet
conditions using an overlap parameter of L = 0.2, i. e. a total overlap length of 2L = 0.4. For classical Dirichlet
conditions one sets the transmission operators to
B+ (u) = u
B− (u) = u,
i. e. the transmitted value is the value of the solution on the interface. In ﬁgure 2 we show the ﬁrst three iterates in
the two cases, Dirichlet conditions need nine iterations to reach a precision of 10−3 for the interface conditions values
while optimised Robin conditions need only three iterations.
For the following tests we want to show the performance of the new transmission conditions when a large spectrum of frequencies is present in the solution. Therefore, we reduce advection speed to b x = 0.01 and the overlap
parameter to L = 0.1, set the initial guess (u01 , v01 ) and (u02 , v02 ) to a random value with mean value 0 and impose homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at both physical boundaries. In ﬁgure 3 we show the error of the ﬁrst ﬁfteen iterates
comparing classical Dirichlet transmission conditions and Robin transmission conditions with a low frequency Taylor
approximation of σ(τ) (deﬁned in equation (5)) around the point τ = 0, i. e. in our case p = b x (cf. [8] for further study
of diﬀerent approximation techniques in this context) and ﬁnally optimised Robin and optimised Ventcel transmission
conditions. As one expects, optimised Ventcel conditions provide the best performance together with optimised Robin
conditions. Dirichlet and Taylor conditions show a poor convergence rate. We want to clarify that we used for Robin
and Ventcel transmission conditions the set of parameters which optimise the performance of the numerical algorithm
applied to this test case and did not use the set of parameters predicted by the theory. We also want to point out
that there is no convergence for the algorithms with pure Dirichlet transmission conditions when L = 0 whereas the
algorithm with Robin and Ventcel transmission conditions also converge without overlap.

Now, we compare the relative error (i. e. E n = e2n
1 / e1 ) of the interface conditions at a ﬁxed iteration (n = 8) for
diﬀerent values of the parameter p in the Robin transmission conditions (cf. ﬁgure 4). One can see that the predicted
value for p∗ obtained as the numerical solution of problem (8) is close to the best performance of the algorithm. The
fact that the theoretical best parameter does not match precisely the p for which we observe the best performance in
this special test case needs further investigations in order to have reliable predictions. Anyway, we are able to build
test cases that result in a perfect accordance of predicted optimal parameter and parameter with optimal numerical
performance. Finally, the occurrence of oscillations close to p∗ is due to the fact that there exist values of p for which
the error reduction at odd n is larger than for even n and vice versa. This mannerism is illustrated in ﬁgure 4 on
the right where we show the error for the last four iterates and zoom in the concerned region of oscillations. This
behaviour needs further investigation as we can not yet explain its origin.
We do now study the asymptotic behaviour of the convergence rate as the mesh is reﬁned with an overlap of
L = Δx where Δt = O(Δx). Therefore, we ﬁx an error precision of 10−14 for the interface values and count the number
of iterations needed to reach the ﬁxed precision. Theoretical convergence bounds (see ﬁgure 5 on the left) for the
case of Δt = O(Δx) are also respected in this case even if they are only proven for scalar advection-diﬀusion-reaction
equations (cf. [8]). For the case of a constant time discretisation (ﬁgure 5 on the right) one can see no more dependency
of the space discretisation on the number of iterations for optimised Robin and Ventcel transmission conditions while
Taylor and even more Dirichlet transmission conditions do hardly change compared to the precedent test. Once again,

we want to point out that, for optimised Robin and Ventcel conditions, we used the parameters predicted by optimising
the convergence rate. As we encounter a discrepancy between predicted parameters and parameters that oﬀer the best
numerical performance, optimised transmission conditions will provide a better performance than they do actually do
here.
5. Conclusion
We have analysed a Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithm applied to a two-species system of reactive-transport
equations. We have shown that optimal transmission conditions lead to a convergence of the algorithm in two iterations. As those optimal conditions are transparent conditions that are in general non-local, they are not aﬀordable
for practical use. Therefore, we studied Robin and Ventcel transmission conditions that are local and convenient to
use. By Fourier analysis we obtained an upper bound for the convergence rate of the algorithm that gives rise to a
best approximation problem in order to obtain optimised transmission conditions. We ﬁnally validated our theoretical
work that was done in a continuous space by numerical tests in a discrete space. We exempliﬁed the performance of
optimised Robin conditions compared to the classical Schwarz method with Dirichlet conditions. Then we illustrated
that the numerical solution of the best approximation problem is close to the real best performance of the Schwarz

algorithm for this class of transmission conditions. Finally, we studied the asymptotic behaviour of the algorithm. All
the theoretical results in this paper are for continuous and inﬁnite domains in 2D. Numerical tests have been done on
a 1D prototype as the theoretical results are also valid for 1D.
In our tests we encountered the problem that the predicted optimal values for the parameters in Robin and Ventcel transmission conditions do not always match perfectly with the parameters that are needed to obtain the best
performance. The origin of this discrepancy has not yet been enlighten and further study will be necessary.
The next step of our work will be the validation of our theoretical results on a two dimensional code. Furthermore,
we will test the theoretical results under more realistic physical assumptions including non linear reaction terms and a
space dependent reactive surface area. Those scenarios imply severe restrictions on time and space discretisations that
can be quite localised. In this case, the Schwarz waveform algorithm applied with diﬀerent discretisations is expected
to prove its performance in order to overcome those restrictions.
