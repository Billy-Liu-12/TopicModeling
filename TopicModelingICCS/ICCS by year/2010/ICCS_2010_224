Abstract
The essence of the Electro Droplet-Jet Technology (EDJT) consists of the production of a linear sequence of monodisperse
droplets of a fluid, separated from each other by equal distances. Numerical simulation of a liquid jet dispersion and a two-phase
droplet flow problem were performed. The effect of the computational mesh on the predictions was investigated; in particular,
the influence of the angle of the cylinder sector on the processes of the jet breakup. The computation for the jet dispersion into
monodisperse droplets due to the forced harmonic disturbance of the velocity field with the oscillation frequency was made. Then
the calculation for the meshes with the various numbers of cells was performed. Similar computations were made for working
liquids with various viscosity and surface tension coefficients.

1. Introduction
In a wide range of applications the problem of liquid jet dispersion into monodisperse droplets of a given size and
droplet intervals is a challenging problem for various areas of science and industry in connection with the
development of new-generation energy converters of signals coming from physically dissimilar control systems and
also with the advent of electrical stream-droplet computer-controlled technologies [1, 2].
In spite of a large number of publications devoted to these phenomena (see, for example, [3-5]), the available
information often concerns uncontrolled dispersion of liquid jets into polydisperse drops with the influence of the
gas environment neglected. In the majority of investigations considering environmental effects, each of the system's
components (gas, jet, and drops) is modeled independently, which makes such an approach awkward and the
problem hard to close. In experimental investigations, only the integral characteristics of turbulization and
dispersion of the jet are considered, as a rule, which impedes separation of contributions from different physical
mechanisms to the total pattern of the process.

At the present time the problem of the jet dispersion notices attention in connection with the necessity of the new
generation lithographers producing. These lithographers use the Laser Produced Plasma Extreme Ultra-Violet (LPP
EUV) sources and focus the high-power laser on the lithium and tin micro-droplets, that are emitted by the highfrequency generator [6].
This paper presents some results of the numerical simulation of the dispersion process. Special attention is paid to
the effect of satellite droplet production with linear scales much smaller than that of the main droplets.
Electro Droplet-Jet Technology (EDJT) under computer control was considered in application to labeling
techniques of a wide range of industry products.
The essence of the EDJT consists of the production of a linear sequence of mono-disperse droplets of a fluid (up
to 105 droplets per second), separated from each other by equal distances. In addition, an electric charge of certain
value and both signs can be imparted to the droplet and then it can be deflected in the electric field to the specific
point of the marked surface.
In the implementation of the EDJT the principle point is the determination of the distance Lp from the orifice to
the starting point of the jet breakup. As opposed to the previously made researches [7, 8] investigation of the
velocity oscillation amplitude and the surface tension influence on the distance from the orifice to the starting point
of the jet breakup was obtained in this paper.
2. Mathematical model
Numerical simulation of a liquid jet dispersion and a two-phase droplet flow problem were performed.
Computations of the working liquid jet outflow from a circular nozzle to ambient gas (air) was carried out using the
volume of fluid (VOF) method, that is usually applied for tracking liquid-gas interface, in particular, in the
simulation of jet breakup, motion of gas bubbles in a liquid and so on. In the framework of the VOF method the
Navier-Stokes equations are implemented by the continuity equation for the liquid phase. Given equations are
solved for every volume point and the physical properties of the fluids are computed as a weighted average of the
volume fraction in each cell.
Continuity equation (1) and Navier-Stokes equations (2) describe the movement of the viscous Newtonian fluids
and can be expressed in a vector form as:
¬í ¬òU

wUU
wt

 U (U ¬ò ¬í)U  P'U  ¬íp  FS

where ¬í is the del operator, U is the flow velocity, t is the time, Œº is the dynamic viscosity coefficient, Fs is the
surface tension force, »° is the fluid density, p is the pressure.
The volume of fluid in a computational cell is calculated as:
Fvol=»ñVcell

(3)

where Vcell is the volume of a cell, »ñ is the fluid fraction in a cell, that having values in a range between 0 and 1. If a
fluid completely fills the cell then »ñ is equal 1 and if there is no fluid in a cell then it is equal to 0.
The scalar function »ñ can be expressed by the separate transport equation (4):

The density in any cell of the computational mesh is computed as:

where N is the number of the surfaces f of the control volume, nf is a unit vector normal to the surface f, Af is the
volume related surface area f, Uf , »°f, pf are the velocity vector, density and pressure on the surface f, respectively,
Uc, FSC , U c are the velocity, surface tension force vectors and density in the centers of the control volume cells,
respectively. The discrete values of all quantities are set in the cell centers and to obtain the values on the surfaces,
interpolation is used. The first-order Euler scheme is used to get the time discretization of the equations.
Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic models (1) ‚Äì (13) was performed in an open source computational
fluid dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM 1.5. That toolbox consists of the libraries set, that is the toolbox for solving the
differential equations in spatial and temporal partial derivatives.
To make the calculation in the OpenFOAM it is necessary to perform the following operations:
x Generate the computational mesh
x Set the operating conditions

4. Algorithm validation and results

The effect of the computational mesh on the predictions was investigated; in particular, the influence of the angle
of the cylinder sector on the processes of the jet breakup on the monodisperse droplets (with and without satellites)
in the three-dimensional axisymmetric problem research was done to within 1%. The 2¬∞, 5¬∞ and 8¬∞ angle
computation was calculated. The 5¬∞ angle was selected as a base, because the time of simulation was considerably
reduced and an acceptable accuracy was provided in that case. The simulation of the control impact was performed
by setting the velocity harmonic oscillation of the jet in the orificial outlet boundary condition.
Then the calculation for the meshes with the various numbers of cells was performed. As a result, the distance Lp
from the orifice to the starting point of the jet breakup depending on the number of cells in the mesh was obtained
and is shown in Fig.1.

Fig.1. Distance L p of number of cells in the mesh

According to Fig.1 changes in distance Lp depend to a considerable degree on the number of cells in the mesh up
to 240 thousand cells and as the number of cells increases further, changes in Lp becomes negligible. As a calculated
power and a time frame of the research are limited, therefore the further computation will be performed using the
mesh consist of the 240 thousand of cells.
Numerical simulation of the working liquid jet transmission with a velocity of 25 meters per second out of the
circular nozzle, with a diameter of 74 micrometers, to the air filled domain was performed. The computational
results of the jet dispersion into monodisperse droplets due to the forced harmonic disturbance of the velocity field
with the oscillation frequency of 85 kHz and the amplitude of 0.5 mps are shown in Fig.2.

Fig.2. Computational results of jet dispersion

On the basis of the computational data it is possible to conclude, that the diameters of the monodisperse droplets
are approximately equal to two diameter widths of the nozzle; this result conforms to theoretical predictions and is

confirmed by the experimental data.
Similar computations were made for working liquids with various viscosity and surface tension coefficients. The
distance Lp for various surface tension coefficients was obtained and is shown in Fig.3.

Fig.3. Distance Lp of surface tension coefficient

The fluctuations of the jet diameter are the reason for the instability, and according to the data shown in the Fig.3.
it is possible to make the conclusion, that this process is affected more by surface tension increases and that is the
reason why the distance of the jet breakup decreases.
The problem of the distance Lp dependence on velocity oscillation amplitude was investigated. Numerical
computations for disturbances with different velocity oscillation amplitude were performed; the results are shown in
Fig.4.

Fig.4. Distance Lp of velocity oscillation amplitude

According to Fig.1 changes in distance Lp have nonmonotonic type. Decrease of the Lp value obtains up to
velocity oscillation amplitude of 1.5 mps and then the distance from the orifice to the starting point of the jet
breakup increases.
Conclusions

By the use of open source computational fluid dynamics toolbox OpenFOAM 1.5 generalized model for
numerical simulation of a jet flow into a gas is developed. This model allows one to study the disintegration of the

724

jet into monodisperse drops depending on the type of forced oscillations (amplitude and frequency) and the
properties of the working liquid (surface tension, viscosity, density and etc.). Investigation of the velocity oscillation
amplitude and the surface tension influence on the distance from the orifice to the starting point of the jet breakup
was obtained. In the further researches distance Lp dependence on the oscillation frequency and various methods of
setting the forced disturbance will be investigated.
