Abstract
We study how network performance in delivering packets to their destinations is affected by routing algorithm coupled with
volume of incoming traffic. We focus our study on the number of packets in transit (NPT) that is an aggregate measure of a
network quality of service (QoS) performance. The NPT network performance indicator measures directly the number of packets
in the network on their routes to their destinations. We carry out our study using a time-discrete simulation model that is an
abstraction of the Network Layer of the ISO OSI Reference Model. This model focuses on packets and their routing. We consider
a static routing and two different types of dynamic routings and different volumes of incoming traffic in the network free flow
state. Our study shows that the efficiency of performance of a routing measured as an average value of the NPT time series and as
a variability of this series, changes with the volume of incoming traffic among the considered routings. Thus, depending on the
volume of incoming traffic it is preferable to use one type of routing over the other ones if the objective is to maintain the lowest
number of packets in transit and their variability, i.e. the highest QoS network performance.

1. Introduction
The most common technology of current data communication networks (e.g., the Internet, wireless networks, adhoc networks, etc.) is Packet Switching Network (PSN) [1], [2]. Data communication networks are complex
systems, performance of which depends on many factors and on coupling among these factors, i.e. network
connection topology, routing, volume of incoming packet traffic, and its type, etc. To better understand how
network performance and packet traffic dynamics depends on network factors and on their couplings often it is
useful to consider simplified models of PSNs, e.g. [3]-[9]. We limit our study of PSNs to the Network Layer of the
International Standard Organization Open Systems Interconnect (ISO OSI) Reference Model [1], [2]. In our study
we use an abstraction of the Network Layer developed in [5], [6] and its time-discrete simulation model [10], [11].
This abstraction focuses on packets and their routing. The goal of our investigation is to study how routing coupled
with volume of incoming traffic (source load value) impacts network quality of service (QoS) performance in

delivering packets to their destinations. We focus our study on the number of packets in transit (NPT) that is an
aggregate measure of the network performance. This network performance indicator measures directly how many
packets are in the network on their routes to their destinations. Thus, it provides direct information on how the
coupling of a source load value with a given type of routing affects network efficiency and stability, which is
measured by an average value of the NPT time series and its variability. We consider a static routing and two
different types of dynamic routings and source load values in the network free flow state. Our study shows that
depending on a source load value one or another type of routing is more efficient. For example, among the
considered routings, for small source load values the NPT values are the lowest for the static routing. However, they
are the highest for the source load values approaching the phase transition point from free flow to the congested
network state, i.e. the critical point. For these source load values the dynamic routing, which we call QSPO, based
on routing decisions taking under consideration a number of hops that a packet must perform from its current
location to its destination and the information how congested the routers are, performs the best. Also, our study
shows that variability in number of packets in transit depends on the coupling of a source load value with a given
type of routing. For example, among the considered routings, for small source load values the variability in number
of packets in transit is the lowest when the static routing is used. However, when the source load values approach
the critical point the variability in number of packets in transit is the highest for the static routing and the lowest for
the dynamic routing QSPO. This means that for small source load values the static routing provides the highest QoS.
While, for high source load values the static routing provides the lowest QoS and the dynamic routing QSPO
provides the highest QoS.
Our study shows, that among the considered routings the network efficiency and stability in delivering packets to
their destinations, i.e. the network QoS, depend on a source load value. Thus, for a given source load value it may be
preferable to use one type of routing than the other ones if the objective is to maintain the lowest number of packets
in transit and their variability, i.e. the highest QoS of network performance.
2. Description of Packet Switching Network Model
We briefly describe the PSN model, developed in [5], [6], and its C++ simulator, called Netzwerk-1 [10], [11]
that we use in our study. The PSN model is an abstraction of the ISO OSI Network Layer Reference Model. The
PSN model focuses on packets and their routings. It is scalable, distributed in space, and time discrete. It avoids the
overhead of protocol details present in many PSN simulators designed with different aims in mind.
In the PSN model each node performs the functions of host and router and maintains one incoming and one
outgoing queue which is of unlimited length and operates according to a first-in, first-out policy. At each node,
independently of the other nodes, packets are created randomly with probability O called source load. In the PSN
model all messages are restricted to one packet carrying only the following information: time of creation, destination
address, and number of hops taken.
The PSN model connection topology is represented by a weighted directed multigraph L where each node
corresponds to a vertex and each communication link is represented by a pair of parallel edges oriented in opposite
directions. To each edge is assigned a cost of packet transmission. For a given PSN model set-up all edge costs are
computed using the same type of edge cost function (ecf) that is either the ecf called ONE (ONE), or QueueSize
(QS), or QueueSizePlusOne (QSPO). The ecf ONE assigns a value of “one” to all edges in the lattice L. The ecf QS
assigns to each edge in the lattice L a value equal to the length of the outgoing queue at the node from which the
edge originates. The ecf QSPO assigns a value that is the sum of a constant “one” plus the length of the outgoing
queue at the node from which the edge originates. The ecf ONE edge cost does not change during a simulation run,
thus this results in a static routing. Since the routing decisions made using the ecf QS or QSPO rely on the current
state of the network simulation this implies adaptive or dynamic routing. In the PSN model, each packet is
transmitted via routers from its source to its destination according to the routing decisions made independently at
each router and based on a minimum least-cost criterion. During a simulation of the PSN model using dynamic
routing packets have the ability to avoid congested nodes, they do not have this ability when static routing is used
instead.
In the PSN model time is discrete and we observe the network state at the discrete times k = 0, 1, 2, …, T, where
T is the final simulation time. At time k = 0, the setup of the PSN model is initialized with empty queues and the
routing tables are computed. The time-discrete, synchronous and spatially distributed PSN model algorithm consists

of the sequence of five operations advancing the simulation time from k to k + 1. These operations are: (1) Update
routing tables, (2) Create and route packets, (3) Process incoming queue, (4) Evaluate network state, (5) Update
simulation time. The detailed description of this algorithm is provided in [5], [6].
A PSN model setup is defined by a selection of: a type of network connection topology, a type of ecf, a type of
routing table and its update algorithm, a value of source load, seeds of two pseudo-random number generators and a
final simulation time T. The first pseudo-random number generator provides the sequence of numbers required for
packets generation and routing. The second one is used for specifying the network connection topology. The details
of PSN model setup are provided in [6].
3. PSN Model Simulation Experiments and Network Performance Indicators
In this paper we analyze simulation data for the PSN model setups with a network connection topology that is
isomorphic to Lp(16) (i.e., a two-dimensional periodic square lattice with 16 nodes in the horizontal and vertical
directions), full-table routing and distributed routing table update and we use the default value for the second
pseudo-random number generator. The incoming traffic is generated, at the network nodes, by Bernoulli random
variables with expected value Ȝ, i.e. source load value. In our simulation experiments we vary the values of the
following setup variables: ecf, source load and seed of the first pseudo-random number generator. Some times we
call these setup variables as factors or treatments. We use, respectively, the following conventions Lp(16, ecf) and
Lp(16, ecf, Ȝ), where ecf = ONE, or QS, or QSPO, when we want to specify with what type of ecf and additionally
with what value of source load Ȝ the PSN model is setup.
In the PSN model, for each family of network setups, which differ only in the value of the source load O, values
of Osub-c for which packet traffic is congestion-free are called sub-critical source loads, while values Osup-c for which
traffic is congested are called super-critical source loads. The critical source load Oc is the largest sub-critical
source load. Thus, Oc is an important network performance indicator because it is the phase transition point from free
flow to congested state of a network. Details about how we estimate the critical source load are provided in [6].
For the PSN model setups considered here the estimated critical source load (CSL) values are, respectively, Oc =
0.115 for Lp(16, ONE), Oc = 0.120 for Lp(16, QS) and Oc = 0.120 for Lp(16, QSPO) [12], [13].
Our study focuses on the free flow state for each PSN model setup. We analyze the performance of PSN model
setups Lp(16, ecf, Ȝ), for ecf = ONE, QS, QSPO, sub-critical source load values Ȝ = 0.005, 0.020, 0.030, 0.040,
0.050, 0.060, 0.070, 0.080, 0.090, 0.095, 0.100, 0.105 and 0.110, 24 different seed values l , where l = 1, …, 24, of
the first pseudo-random number generator. Thus, we consider source load values from very small ones to those close
to the phase transition point and investigate how an experimental (simulation) setup of PSN model (i.e., treatment)
affects the behaviour of the response variable number of packets in transit [6]. We call the considered set of Ȝ values
FreeFlow set. We carry out our investigations for the final simulation time T = 8000. Even though the final
simulation time is T = 8000 only the data from k = 2001 is accounted for in order to remove the initial transient
effects caused by the setups of the PSN model always with empty queues. Thus, notice, in all the presented graphs
time axis scale goes always from 0 to 6000 to account for the discarded data.
Number of packets in transit (NPT), i.e. N(k) time series, is given by the total number of packets in the network at
time k, i.e. by the sum over all network nodes of the number of packets in each out-going queue at time k. The NPT
time series is an important time dependent aggregate measure of network performance providing information on
how many packets are in the network on their routes to their destinations at time k for a given PSN model setup.
Fig. 1 shows the graphs of Nl(k) time series for k = 2001 to 8000 for PSN model setup Lp(16, ecf, Ȝ) with ecf
ONE, QS and QSPO (left, middle and right column, respectively) and Ȝ = 0.040, 0.080 and 0.105 (top, middle and
bottom row, respectively) for l = 1, …, 24 considered seed values of the first pseudo-random number generator. We
observe that
1. each Nl(k) time series fluctuates around a constant mean depending on ecf type and source load value;
2. for both Ȝ = 0.040 and Ȝ = 0.080 when ecf QS is used the respective mean values of the NPT series are
much higher than the mean values when ecf ONE or ecf QSPO is used;
3. for Ȝ = 0.105 when ecf ONE and ecf QS is used, respectively, the corresponding mean values of the NPT
series appear to be vey similar ones and they are both higher than the mean value when ecf QSPO is
employed;

with the increase of source load values the order of the magnitudes of the ecf dependent mean values
changes;
with the increase of the source load values the magnitudes of fluctuations of Nl(k) time series increase.

The plots on Fig. 1 provide some qualitative insight into how the packet traffic dynamics and network QoS
performance change with the increase of source load values for the considered ecfs. To better understand these
changes and to quantify them we study statistical characteristics/measures of NPT time series. Namely, source load
dependent mean value functions N^(ecf, Ȝ) and source load dependent variance functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ).
4. Impact of Source Load and ECF on Number of Packet in Transit
We measure the QoS of a PSN model setup Lp(16, ecf, Ȝ) by the efficiency with which packets are delivered to
their destinations and by the stability in number of packets in transit. We measure a routing efficiency by mean
value of the NPT time series and we measure the routing stability by variability of the variance of these series, in
both cases calculated as averages over the length of the considered simulation run time and the number of the
simulation runs. The smaller the values of these statistical measures of network performance the better QoS provides
a PSN model setup, i.e. the routing is more efficient and stable in delivering the packets to their destinations, as on
average there are fewer packets in transit in the network and with smaller fluctuations. We investigate if for subcritical source load values the QoS in delivering packets to their destinations, i.e. efficiency and stability, changes
among various ecfs (i.e., routings) when source load values increase.
Fig. 2 displays the graphs of source load dependent mean value functions N^(ecf, Ȝ) in (a), and the graphs of
source load dependent variance functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ) in (b), of Nl(k) times series, where l = 1, …., 24 is,
respectively, the seed value l of the first pseudo-random number generator. As mentioned earlier, these statistical
measures of network performance are calculated as averages over the number of simulation samples (i.e., 24) and
over the length of the considered simulation run time (i.e., 6000) for each PSN model setup Lp(16, ecf, Ȝ), with ecf
= ONE, QS, QSPO, respectively, and Ȝ belonging to the FreeFlow set.

On Fig. 2 (a) we observe that
1. the values of all three mean value functions monotonically increase with the increase of Ȝ;
2. the rates of increase of the mean value functions N^(QS, Ȝ) and N^(QSPO, Ȝ) are similar ones and they
appear to be smaller than the rate of increase of the function N^(ONE, Ȝ);
3. for Ȝ < 0.100 the values of the mean value function N^(QS, Ȝ) are much larger than those of the functions
N^(ONE, Ȝ) and N^(QSPO, Ȝ);
4. for source loads Ȝ < 0.095 the values of the mean value functions N^(ONE, Ȝ) and N^(QSPO, Ȝ) do not differ
much, but they differ significantly for Ȝ  0.100;
5. the order of the magnitudes of the mean value functions N^(ecf, Ȝ) changes with the increase of source load
values and in the FreeFlow set we can identify 4 different subsets such that within each of these subsets the
order stays the same. Namely, (i) N^(QS, Ȝ) is significantly greater than both N^(ONE, Ȝ) and N^(QSPO, Ȝ),
and N^(ONE, Ȝ) § N^(QSPO, Ȝ), for each Ȝ  0.030 (approximately); (ii) N^(ONE, Ȝ) < N^(QSPO, Ȝ) <
N^(QS, Ȝ) for 0.030 < Ȝ  0.090; (iii) N^(QSPO, Ȝ) < N^(ONE, Ȝ) < N^(QS, Ȝ) for 0.090 < Ȝ <0.105; (iv)
N^(QSPO, Ȝ) < N^(QS, Ȝ) < N^(ONE, Ȝ) for Ȝ  0.105.
When one focuses only on the mean values of the NPT time series, we can conclude that the network efficiency
of delivering packets to their destinations is ecf and load dependent. The observations stated in (i)-(iv) in the item 5
above imply that for the values of Ȝ  0.090 the static routing using ecf ONE is the most efficient one in delivering
packets to their destinations, as the average number of packets in the network on their routes to their destinations is
the lowest one. The packets travel along the shortest paths (i.e., the paths with the minimum number of hopes) and
they do not queue for too long at the routers as there are seldom local congestions along the paths in free flow state
of the network. The efficiency of the dynamic routing employing ecf QSPO is close to the one using ecf ONE, due to
the ONE component of the ecf QSPO that pushes the routing to select the paths with minimum number of hops from
packets current locations to their destinations. The dynamic routing using ecf QS is the least efficient one as the
average number of packets in transit is the highest. The reason for this is that the least cost routing using ecf QS
always sends the packets from their current nodes to their destinations along the routes which have the smallest
sums’ of queues. This routing tries to avoid congested routers and as a result redistribute the packets rather evenly
among the routers. It does not take under consideration through how many routers packets must hop to reach their
destinations. These result in packets performing almost random walks as many paths from packets current locations
to their destinations may have very similar costs. Thus, packets stay longer in the network as they do not have
enough clues how to reach their destinations. This is prevented by the ONE component of the ecf QSPO. When
0.090 < Ȝ <0.105 the dynamic routing using ecf QSPO becomes the most efficient one, as it takes under
consideration not only the number of hops that packets must perform to reach their destinations but also the queue
sizes of the routers located along the packets routes. This allows packets to avoid locally congested network routers.
As before the routing using ecf QS, i.e. the routing that is only router load dependent, is the least efficient one. When
Ȝ  0.105, i.e. for Ȝ close to the critical points Oc the most efficient routing is the one using ecf QSPO and the least
efficient one is the one using ecf ONE. The reason for this is that the local congestions build up and the dynamic
routing using ecf QSPO or ecf QS has the ability to avoid locally congested network routers. The static routing does
not have this ability and packets accumulate further in the already locally congested network routers, as can be seen
from Fig. 1 for Ȝ = 0.105.
On Fig. 2 (b) we observe that
1. the values of all three load dependent variance functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ) are monotonically increasing with
the increase of Ȝ. The rate of increase of these functions is similar up to Ȝ § 0.095. Pass this point the
function Var N(ONE, Ȝ) has much higher rate of increase than the two other functions;
2. for each Ȝ < 0.090 the values of the load dependent variance functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ) differ only slightly for
all three ecfs. However, the values of Var N(QS, Ȝ) are higher than those of Var N(ONE, Ȝ) and Var
N(QSPO, Ȝ). This means that the NPT data of the PSN model using ecf QS has larger variability around its
mean than the NPT data of the PSN model using either one of the two others ecfs.
3. the values of the load dependent variance functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ) diverge rapidly for Ȝ > 0.90 and these
values satisfy the inequalities Var N(ONE, Ȝ) > Var N(QS, Ȝ) > Var N(QSPO, Ȝ). This means that the NPT
data of the PSN model using ecf ONE has the largest variability around its mean and the NPT data of the
PSN model using ecf QSPO has the lowest variability around its mean;

4.

for each ecf type the rate of increase of its variance function Var N(ecf, Ȝ) increases rapidly when the source
load values Ȝ approach the respective Oc values, (i.e., for 0.095  Ȝ  0.115), in particular, this is the case
for the variance function Var N(ONE, Ȝ).
From the above we can conclude that the magnitudes’ of fluctuations in the NPT time series around their
respective means are similar ones for all three ecfs when Ȝ < 0.090, implying that the stabilities of the corresponding
routings are similar ones. However, the magnitudes’ of fluctuations are significantly different when Ȝ > 0.090. The
NPT data of the PSN model using ecf ONE, i.e. using the static routing, shows the highest variability. Thus, the
static routing shows the highest instability among the routings for Ȝ > 0.090. As the source load values approach the
critical points the local congestions build up randomly. Since the static routing does not have the ability to send
packets avoiding congested network routers this leads to high random fluctuations in packet traffic over time and
over different simulations. The least variability shows the NPT data of the PSN model using ecf QSPO, i.e. the
dynamic routing using the ecf combining both the router load dependent and the static cost components. The router
load dependent cost component of the ecf QSPO pushes the routing to send packets along the routes avoiding locally
congested routers and the static cost component of ecf pushes the routing to select the routes with minimum number
of hops from packets current locations to their destinations. The superposition of these two cost components results
in the routing using ecf QSPO being the most efficient one (see Fig. 1) and the most stable one (see Fig. 2) when
source load values are high. The considered dynamic routings send packets along the routes avoiding congested
network routers; they “smooth out” the packet distributions among the routers. This results in higher routing
stability as there is less random fluctuation in the packet traffic over time and over different simulations, in
particular when Ȝ > 0.090.
When the least cost dynamic routing bases on the ecf QS, i.e. on the ecf depending only on the routers’ loads, as a
response to the queue size changes and rapid routing table updates, poor route selections may happen causing
oscillatory packet behaviours. This leads to packets staying unnecessarily long in transit (see Fig. 1) and to the
increased fluctuations in their numbers (see Fig. 2). This is why the QoS of a network using the ecf QS is worst than
the QoS of a network using ecf QSPO.
Looking at the plots on Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we may conclude that the QoS of a network in delivering packets to
their destinations depends on the combination of the routing and source load value. Thus, the QoS can be maximized
by selecting a routing type depending on an amount of the incoming traffic. Furthermore, the dynamic routing using
the ecf QSPO provides overall a good QoS in delivering packets to their destinations regardless what is the source
load value. Also, the observed increase in values of the variance functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ), i.e. of fluctuations of NPT
data, when source loads approach the respective critical points, i.e. phase transition points from free flow to
congested network states, is consistent with the phase transition phenomena and observed behaviours of packet
traffic in data networks [3], [6]-[9].
5. Conclusions and Future Work
The above discussed source load dependent mean value functions N^(ecf, Ȝ) and source load dependent variance
functions Var N(ecf, Ȝ) are statistical aggregate measures of network performance that provide some insight into the
number of packets in transit and their variability. Thus, these functions provide insight into how efficiently the
routing delivers the packets to their destinations and how it is stable for a given ecf type and source load value. Our
study shows that the efficiency of performance of a routing, measured as an average value of the NPT time series
and the stability measured as a variability of these series, change with source load values among the considered ecfs.
Thus, depending on a source load value, to provide the highest QoS in delivering packets, it may be preferable to
use one type of ecf over the other ones if the objective is to maintain the lowest number of packets in transit and
their variability. The network using the static routing provides the highest QoS in delivering packets to their
destinations when the source load values are far from the critical points. However, for source load values close to
the critical points the dynamic routings (i.e., the routing using ecf QS or QSPO) are more efficient ones than the
static routing. The dynamic routings have the ability to send packets along the routes avoiding congested network
nodes. This allows packets to reach their destinations faster and results in lower number of packets in transit. Also,
they distribute the packets more evenly among the network routers. This results in less fluctuation in the packet
traffic that is reflected by the lower variability in the NPT data. The dynamic routing using the ecf QSPO provides

overall a good QoS in delivering packets to their destinations regardless what is the source load value. For the
source load values close to the critical points it provides the highest QoS in delivering packets.
Since the considered mean value and variance functions are time averages they ignore time differences among
the NPT time series. They provide coarse granularity, both spatially and temporally, information about networkwide QoS performance. We plan to refine our the analysis by investigating the time differences among NPT time
series using functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) model [14] and explore how time variability of NPT time
series is affected by various PSN model setups, i.e. treatments. This work will be an extension of our work started in
[15]. Additionally, we plan to continue our study of packet traffic fluctuations as a function of network connection
topology, routing and incoming traffic volumes that we commenced in [16], [17] and [18].
