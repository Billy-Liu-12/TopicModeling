Abstract
We propose a nonequilibrium sampling method for computing free energy proﬁles along a given reaction coordinate. The method consists of two parts: a controlled Langevin sampler that generates nonequilibrium bridge paths
conditioned by the reaction coordinate, and Jarzynski’s formula for reweighting the paths. Our derivation of the equations of motion of the sampler is based on stochastic perturbation of a controlled dissipative Hamiltonian system,
for which we prove Jarzynski’s identity as a special case of the Feynman-Kac formula. We illustrate our method by
means of a suitable numerical example and brieﬂy discuss issues of optimally choosing the control protocol for the
reaction coordinate.

1. Introduction
Given a system assuming states x ∈ X with the energy H(x), the total free energy can be deﬁned as [1]
F = −β−1 ln Z,

exp(−βH(x))dx,

Z=
X

where β > 0 denotes the system’s inverse temperature. Jarzynski’s equality [2, 3] relates the free energy diﬀerence
ΔF = −β−1 ln

Z1
Z0

between two equilibrium states of a system given by an unperturbed energy function H = H0 and its perturbation H1
with the work W done on the system under the perturbation: Suppose we set Hξ = (1 − ξ)H0 + ξH1 with ξ ∈ [0, 1], and
assume we set a protocol that describes how the system evolves from ξ = 0 to ξ = 1 (see [4, 5]). If, initially, the states
x ∈ X are distributed according to the equilibrium distribution exp(−βH0 ) then, by the second law of thermodynamics,
it follows that EW ≥ ΔF where W is the total work done on the system and E denotes the average over all possible
realizations of the transition from H0 to H1 ; equality is attained if the transition is inﬁnitely slow (i.e., adiabatically).
Jarzynski’s equality now asserts that
ΔF = −β−1 ln E exp(−βW) .

Although controversial, Jarzynski’s equality can be unambiguously derived when the underlying dynamics are diﬀusive, in which case the identity turns out to be an instance of the Feynman-Kac formula; for a critical discussion of
possible issues and diﬀerent notions of free energy see, e.g., [6, 7] and the references therein. Here, we wish to point
out that, in this context, one must be careful when relating and applying Jarzynski’s equality to pulling experiments
(either in computer simulations or single-molecule pulling experiments,) since it tacitly assumes that the initial values
are randomly distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution exp(−βH0 ), which is typically not available.
In this paper we address the problem of computing conditional free energy proﬁles along a reaction coordinate for
the unperturbed system, rather than total free energy diﬀerences between perturbed and unperturbed system. That is,
for a given function of the coordinates (typically some of the conﬁgurations), φ(x), we consider the quantity
F(ξ) = −β−1 ln Z(ξ),

Z(ξ) =
X

exp(−βH(x))δ(φ(x) − ξ) dx .

As sampling the Boltzmann distribution is prohibitively expensive, conditional free energy proﬁles are often computed
by thermodynamic integration [8]. Thermodynamic integration exploits the fact that the derivative of F can be recast
as a conditional average over a generalized force f (see Section 2.1),
F (ξ) = −β−1

1
Z(ξ)

X

f (x) exp(−βH(x))δ(φ(x) − ξ) dx ,

which is why the free energy is also termed potential of mean force. In comparison to the full Boltzmann distribution,
the conditional distributions are relatively cheap to evaluate, for the reaction coordinate is typically the “slowest”
variable in the system (see Figure 1 below). In practical terms this means that one has to discretize the reaction
coordinate and sample each of the grid points. The free energy proﬁle is then reconstructed by integration,
ξ

F(ξ) − F(0) =

F (ζ) dζ .
0

Figure 1: Sampling the free energy is slowed down by large energy barriers in the direction of the reaction coordinate.

Here we adopt a diﬀerent strategy: rather than constraining the reaction coordinate to the grid points we let it
vary continuously. More speciﬁcally, we design a sampling scheme that allows for arbitrarily controlling ξ and prove
a Jarzynski equality for the exponential reweighting of the trajectories. When the reactions coordinate is moved
adiabatically, i.e., inﬁnitely slowly, the method converges to thermodynamic integration (or a continuous variant
thereof). Our approach is based on degenerate diﬀusions of Langevin type and is similar to the method proposed in
[9] for non-degenerate diﬀusions (overdamped Langevin); in the overdamped limit our method reduces to the method
in [9]. Although beyond the scope of this article, an obvious extension of the sampling scheme would involve its
reformulation as an optimal control problem so as to obtain estimators that have, e.g., minimum variance or optimal
rates of convergence. We brieﬂy discuss these issues at the end of the article.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we state the equations of motion of the stochastic Langevin
sampler and prove the analogue of Jarzynski’s equality by means of Feynman-Kac formula. Section 3 contains the
numerical example: a 4-dimensional system with slow and fast coordinates. We conclude with an outlook for further
improvement in Section 4.
2. Controlled Langevin dynamics
Let H : X → R, X ⊆ R2n be the Hamiltonian
H(x1 , x2 ) =

1 2
|x2 | + V(x1 ) .
2

(1)

where here and in the following we shall use the shorthand x = (x1 , x2 ) with xi = (xi1 , . . . , xin ). The function V is
assumed to be smooth, bounded below and to satisfy the usual growth conditions at inﬁnity. We consider dynamics of
Langevin type, viz.,
dX(t) = (J − D)∇H(X(t))dt + S dW(t) ,

X(0) = x

Suppose we are given a smooth reaction coordinate φ(x) := φ(x1 ) with |∇φ| 0 almost everywhere.1 We want to
perturb the Langevin dynamics (2) systematically by adding a force acting along the reaction coordinate. To this end,
we adopt ideas from [10] and introduce the projected Hamiltonian
˜
H(x)
= H(x1 , P(x1 )x2 ) .

(3)

with
P=I−

∇φ∇φT
.
|∇φ|2

It can be readily checked that P2 = P and P = PT , hence P is the orthogonal projection onto the codimension-1 kernel
of ∇φ. The thus deﬁned Hamiltonian has the property that, when substituted into (2), it makes φ a conserved quantity
under the dynamics, i.e., dφ(X1 (t)) = 0. We can go one step further and add a control force that allows for controlling
the value of φ arbitrarily. This yields a Langevin equation of the form
˜
dX(t) = ((J − D)∇H(X(t))
+ u(t)B(X(t)))dt + S dW(t) ,

with the control u : R → R and the vector ﬁeld B : X → R
+

B(x) =

2n

X(0) = x

(4)

given by

∇φ(x1 )/|∇φ(x1 )|2
0

.

Lemma 2.1. The solutions of (4) satisfy dφ(X1 (t)) = u(t) dt.
Proof. The position component X1 (t) = (X11 (t), . . . , X1n (t)) in (4) reads
dX1 (t) = (P(X1 (t))X2 (t) + u(t)B(X(t))) dt .

(5)

Thus, Ito’s formula for the derivative of φ(X1 (t)) is just standard chain rule. Using (5),
dφ
= ∇φ(X1 (t))T P(X1 (t))X2 (t) + u(t)∇φ(X1 (t))/|∇φ(X1 (t))|2
dt
= ∇φ(X1 (t))T P(X1 (t))X2 (t) + u(t),

where the ﬁrst term vanishes by deﬁnition of P.

1 We shall use the notation ∇φ to denote the n-dimensional gradient of φ with respect to the argument x , but also the gradient in R2n , i.e., the
1
derivative with respect to all the coordinates (x1 , x2 ). The meaning should be clear from the context.

where x · y = xT y and A : B = tr(AT B) denote the usual inner products between vectors and matrices. In the absence of
˜ is a stationary distribution
forcing, u = 0, and if 2D = βS S T , the unconditioned Boltzmann distribution ρ ∝ exp(−βH)
and solves L∗ ρ = 0 where L∗ is the formal adjoint in L2 (dx).
The space L2 (dx) is somewhat unnatural, however, for the force-free Langevin dynamics has φ as an integral.
Hence the dynamics never leave the level set φ−1 (·) × Rn from which they have started. Instead, it appears natural
to deﬁne all quantities with respect to the invariant volume element of the corresponding deterministic Hamiltonian
system (i.e., for D, S = 0) given by the family of measures
dλξ (x) = δ(φ(x1 ) − ξ) dx .
2

If we deﬁne L (dλξ ) to be the Hilbert space that is equipped with the scalar product
( f, g)ξ =

φ−1 (ξ)×Rn

f g dλξ ,

then the following statement holds.
Lemma 2.2. For u = 0, the formal adjoint in L2 (dλξ ) has the form
1 T

· ∇ + D : ∇2 H˜ .

(7)

Proof. Setting u = 0 in (6), we have to show that (L f, g)ξ = ( f, L∗ g)ξ with the operator L∗ as given above (we omit all
discussions concerning boundary conditions.) It is clear that the ﬁrst term in (7) is the adjoint of the ﬁrst term in (6).
It remains

where, in the second equality, we have used the fact that all terms involving ∇φ vanish since φ is a conserved quantity
and so the vector ﬁeld (J − D)∇H˜ is perpendicular to ∇φ (here understood as a gradient in R2n ).
The next lemma is a straight consequence.
Corollary 2.3. The family of probability measures
dμξ =

dλξ ,
˜
Z(ξ)

˜ =

˜ dλξ

is invariant under the zero-force Langevin dynamics (i.e., for u = 0).
Proof. Let f ∈ C 2,1 (φ−1 (ξ) × Rn , R+ ) be the solution of the Cauchy problem
∂
f (x, t) = L f (x, t) ,
∂t

f (x, 0) = g(x) .

By deﬁnition, μξ is an invariant measure if
f (x, t) dμξ (x) =

f (x, 0) dμξ (x) .

If f solves the Cauchy problem above, it is suﬃcient to show
L f dμξ = 0 .
By Lemma 2.2, it follows that
˜ dλξ ,
f (L∗ exp(−βH))

L f dμξ =

˜ = 0 if 2D = βS S T .
where the right integral vanishes since L∗ exp(−βH)
2.1. Free energy and Jarzynski’s equality
We introduce the conditional free energy as the function
˜ ,
˜ = −β−1 ln Z(ξ)
F(ξ)

˜ =
Z(ξ)

˜
exp(−βH(x))δ(φ(x)
− ξ) dx ,

(8)

where the integration is over a suitable subspace of φ−1 (ξ) × Rn so that the integral exists (note that because of the
projection, the kinetic energy part of H˜ has one ﬂat direction). A more familiar expression is obtained upon integrating
out the momenta which leads to the following result.
Lemma 2.4. Up to additive constants, F˜ equals the standard free energy
F(ξ) = −β−1 ln Z(ξ) ,

Z(ξ) =

exp(−βV(x1 ))δ(φ(x1 ) − ξ) dx1 .

(9)

Proof. We may set β = 1 without loss of generality. Now let Q(x1 ) ∈ Rn×(n−1) with QT Q = I be a family of orthogonal
matrices whose columns span the admissible momentum subspace. We introduce the new momenta q = QT x2 and
p = nT x2 where n = ∇φ/|∇φ| denotes the outer unit normal to φ−1 (ξ). Now I = QQT +nnT which entails x2 = Qq+np.
Doing a change of variables in the expression for the partition function Z and integrating only over the admissible
momenta x2 = Qq yields

exp − |q|2 − V(x1 ) δ(φ(x1 ) − ξ) dx1 dq
2
exp(−V(x1 ))δ(φ(x1 ) − ξ) dx1 ,

which completes the proof.
Diﬀerentiating the free energy (8) it follows upon integration by parts and using the formal identity (which can be
made precise using the co-area formula [11])
∂
δ(φ − ξ) = −|∇φ|−2 ∇φ · ∇δ(φ − ξ) ,
∂ξ
that the derivative of the free energy can be expressed as a conditional expectation with respect to the invariant measure
of the process, namely,
F˜ (ξ) =

where, again, the momentum integration must be suitably restricted. Consequently, we may sample the derivative of
F˜ (or, equivalently, F) by computing the conditional expectations for various values of ξ, from which the free energy
proﬁle can be eventually recovered by integration, viz.,
ξ

F(ξ) − F(0) =

The idea of the forced Langevin equation is to let ξ = ξ(t) vary with rate u(t) and compute the free energy as a suitably
weighted nonequilibrium average of the exerted work. We will need the following identity that again is an instance of
the co-area formula (cf. [9]).
Corollary 2.5. For a suitable test function ϕ ∈ C ∞ (φ−1 (ξ) × Rn ) we have

Now comes our main result.

Theorem 2.6. Let φ(X(t)) = ξ(t) vary with rate ξ (t) = u(t) and let the random variable

In Figure 2 we have plotted the level curves of the potential, superimposed with a sample trajectory of the (nonconstrained) Langevin dynamics. One can observe that trajectories move along the q coordinate while remaining
close to y = 0 if
1. The free energy along the (slow) q coordinate (remember that here ξ = q) can be computed
explicitly, namely,
F(ξ) =

1 2
(ξ − 1)2 + β−1 ln a(ξ; δ).
2

For values of q q0 where a(q; δ) ≈ 1, the q and y dynamics are almost decoupled, whereas for values of q ≈ q0 the
normal frequency grows creating an entropic barrier proportional to the temperature β−1 . The problem then becomes
numerically stiﬀ and one must take suﬃciently small time steps so as to resolve the fast y-dynamics, while transitions
between the two minima, located at q ≈ −1 and q ≈ 1, are rare.
In order to compute the free energy proﬁle by means of nonequilibrium trajectories, we integrate numerically the
forced Langevin dynamics with a simple Euler-Maruyama scheme
√
˜ n ) + hBun + hS ζn+1 , ζn ∼ N(0, 1)
Xn+1 = h(J − D)∇H(X
where B = (1, 0, 0, 0)T and un = u(nh); here h > 0 denotes the integration time step. At this point one could think
of using a more sophisticated numerical integrator (higher order, symplectic integrator, etc.) but since we are dealing
with a relatively simple system, we have simply chosen the time step h suﬃciently small such that the Euler scheme is
stable in the fast direction (in this example the y-coordinate.) In this case, Euler-Maruyama is a ﬁrst order numerical
scheme (in a weak sense) [13] which will estimate the desired distributions in a suﬃciently accurate way.
We have chosen parameters D = diag(0, 0, 10, 10) and S = 2β−1 D. Then, given a protocol ξ (t) = u(t), we
simulate M independent trajectories with initial values (Q0 , P0 ) = (ξ(0), 0) ﬁxed and (Y0 , R0 ) = (y, r) distributed
according to μξ(0) ,
y ∼ N(0, β−1 ( /a(q; δ))2 ) ,

where N(τ) is given by the terminal condition τ = Nh. The free energy proﬁle is then computed as follows: We
notice in (11) that the ﬁnal time τ can be any deterministic time. If we set, without loss of generality, the value of the
free energy at the starting point Q0 , F(Q0 ) = 0, we can set sampling windows along the trajectory from t = 0 to the
terminal time t = τ and compute the accumulated work up to time τ. The free energy F(ξ) = ΔF at the point ξ = QN
is then simply estimated using (12). In Figure 3 we show numerical results for the estimation of the free energy for
diﬀerent values of β. We have chosen Q0 = −1.2 and un = 1.2ω sin(ωnh), with ωNh = π, so that the terminal point
of the integration is QN = 1.2. As we see, the estimated free energy reproduces the exact proﬁle rather accurately,
including the entropic barrier at q = 0.8.
4. Outlook and conclusions
We have introduced a nonequilibrium sampling method for computing free energy proﬁles using controlled (degenerate) diﬀusions. Speciﬁcally, we have proved Jarzinsky’s equality for a certain class of controlled Langevin
processes using the Feynman-Kac formula and illustrated the method by means of a numerical example.

contour lines of the potential V(q, y). Right Panel. Solid lines: Exact free energy F(q) for diﬀerent values of β. Markers: Free

number of integration steps N = 126 500, M = 5000 independent trajectories.

An obvious question now is how the performance of the Langevin sampler can be improved by changing the protocol. For our choice of a sinusoidal control function, we have tried various parameters (i.e., diﬀerent values of ω), as
well as diﬀerent protocols (i.e., not sinusoidal) without showing much eﬀect in the estimate of the free energy or the
sample variance of said estimate. Even given the simple example, one would expect that better results are obtained if
the reaction coordinate moves slowly, so that the remaining variables can equilibrate adiabatically. We have performed
diﬀerent numerical experiments (not shown here) in which we have varied not only the “shape” of the protocol, but
also the “speed” at which the protocol pulls the slow q-coordinate toward its ﬁnal state. These experiments, however,
do not show a convincing improvement or worsening of the estimation of the free energy.
Clearly, the quality of the estimation can always be improved by adding more samples, but this strategy could
be an expensive one. For the estimate of the √expected value of the exponential work in (12), one should expect a
improvement in the Monte Carlo error as O(1/ M) where M is the number of independent realizations of the process,
while the error in the numerical integration should decrease as O(h) where h is the numerical time step in the EulerMaruyama scheme. However, it follows from Jensen’s inequality that the ﬁnite sample estimator (12) overestimates
the correct free energy. Hence one may seek instead to design a control law that minimizes the expectation subject
to ﬁxed terminal condition at t = τ when ξ(τ) reaches its predetermined value. Problems of this kind are known as
risk-sensitive control problems (see [14]). For our purpose, a reasonable optimal control task would be to maximize
the exponential work functional over a suitable space U of admissible controls, viz.,

with the non-zero block of S being σI and 2D = σ2 I. The work functional has the advantage of involving all its
moments, in other words, it also controls the variance of the estimator (see [15]). Here σ > 0 is a small parameter that
controls the temperature of the system (there is no need for a nonequilibrium method at high temperature as the free
energy can easily be computed by a histogram). One can then show, exploiting a result from [16], that I σ ∼ exp(V/σ)
asymptotically as σ → 0 where V is the value function of a certain diﬀerential game.
Of course, the optimal steering protocol strategy does not come for free, and users often will decide to increase
the sample size rather than solving a complicated nonlinear optimal control problem. However, we believe that

experimenting with simple systems may give insight into good control strategies in more general cases, and even for
single-molecule experiments (cf. [4]).
