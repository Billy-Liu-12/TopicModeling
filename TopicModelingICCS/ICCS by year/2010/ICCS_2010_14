Abstract
Many examples of complex systems are provided by applications in ﬁnance and economics areas. Some of intrinsic features of such systems lie with the fact that their parts are interacting in a non-trivial dynamic manner and they
can be subject to stochastic forces and jumps. The mathematical models for such systems are often based on stochastic diﬀerential equations and eﬃcient computational tools are required to solve them. Here, on an example from the
credit risk analysis of multiple correlated ﬁrms, we develop a fast Monte-Carlo type procedure for the analysis of
complex systems such as those occurring in the ﬁnancial market. Our procedure is developed by combining the fast
Monte-Carlo method for one-dimensional jump-diﬀusion processes and the generation of correlated multidimensional
variates. As we demonstrate on the evaluation of ﬁrst passage time density functions in credit risk analysis, this allows
us to analyze eﬃciently multivariate and correlated jump-diﬀusion processes.

1. Introduction
Complex systems usually consist of parts that interact in a dynamic non-trivial manner [14, 15]. Such systems
are found frequently in ﬁnancial applications and economics. For example, in the market economy, individual companies are inevitably linked together via dynamically changing economic conditions. Therefore, the default events of
companies are often correlated, especially in the same industry. Probably, Zhou [20] and Hull et al [7] were the ﬁrst
to incorporate default correlation into the Black-Cox ﬁrst passage structural model, but they have not included the
jumps. The standard Brownian motion model for market behavior falls short of explaining empirical observations of
market returns and their underlying derivative prices Zhou [21], Kou et al [9]. Models describing jump-diﬀusion processes (JDPs) represent an important alternative to the standard Brownian motion model [2] and provide a convenient
framework for investigating many complex phenomena. As soon as jumps are incorporated in the model for most
practical cases we have to resort to numerical procedures where Monte Carlo methods remain a primary candidate for
applications.
The conventional Monte Carlo methods are very straightforward to implement. We discretize the time period into
N intervals with N being large enough in order to avoid discretization bias [8]. The main drawback of this procedure

is that we need to evaluate the processes at each discretized time which is very time-consuming. Many researchers
have contributed to the ﬁeld of enhancement of the eﬃciency of Monte Carlo simulations. Among others, Kuchler
et al [10] discussed the solution of SDEs in the framework of weak discrete time approximations and Liberati et al
[12] considered the strong approximation where the SDE is driven by a high intensity Poisson process. Atiya and
Metwally [2, 16] have developed a fast Monte Carlo-type numerical methods to solve the FPT problem. In our recent
contributions, we reported an extension of this fast Monte-Carlo-type method in the context of multiple non-correlated
jump-diﬀusion processes [18, 19]. In this contribution, we generalize our previous fast Monte-Carlo method (for noncorrelated jump-diﬀusion cases) to multivariate (and correlated) jump-diﬀusion processes. The developed technique
provides an eﬃcient tool for a number of applications, including credit risk and option pricing [11, 1]. We demonstrate
the applicability of this technique to the evaluation of ﬁrst passage time density functions in the default analysis.
2. Models for joint default in the ﬁnancial market
If the ﬁrm (i) assets value Vi (t) falls below a threshold level DVi (t), the ﬁrm defaults. Note that ﬁnding the threshold
level is already a challenge in applications (one of the reasons for that is because ﬁrms often rearrange their liability
structure when they have credit problems). Here we assume that DVi (t) = κi exp(γi t) as proposed by Zhou [20], where
γi is the growth rate of the ﬁrm’s liabilities, while κi is responsible for capturing the liability structure of the ﬁrm
(often deﬁned as the ﬁrm’s short-term liability plus 50% of the ﬁrm’s long-term liability). We set Xi (t) = ln[Vi (t)], in
which case the threshold of Xi (t) is Di (t) = γi t + ln(κi ), and in what follows our main interest is in the dynamics of
process Xi (t).
The default correlation measures the strength of the default relationship between diﬀerent ﬁrms and for two ﬁrms
i and j with respective probabilities Pi and P j it is deﬁned as
Pi j − Pi P j

ρi j =

Pi (1 − Pi )P j (1 − P j )

(1)

,

where Pi j is the probability of joint default. The default correlation deﬁned by (1) plays a key role in the joint default
with important implications in the ﬁeld of credit analysis and other applications.
The ﬁrst passage time model to describe default correlations of two ﬁrms under the “bivariate diﬀusion process”
can be described as follows Zhou [20]:
X1 (t)
X2 (t)

=

μ1
μ2

dt + Ω

dz1
dz2

,

(2)

where μ1 and μ2 are constant drift terms, z1 and z2 are two independent standard Brownian motions, and Ω is a constant
2 × 2 matrix such that
σ21
ρσ1 σ2
Ω·Ω =
.
ρσ1 σ2
σ22
The coeﬃcient ρ reﬂects the correlation between the movements in the asset values of the two ﬁrms. If we assume
that μi = γi (i = 1, 2), then the probability that ﬁrm i defaults at time t can be easily calculated as:
Pi (t) = 2 · Φ −

where
Zi ≡

(3)

Xi (0) − ln(κi )
σi

is the standardized distance of ﬁrm i to its default point and Φ(·) denotes the cumulative probability distribution
function for a standard normal variable.
However, this and other classical models do not include jumps in the processes, while it is well-known that jumps
are a major factor in credit risk analysis and other applications. Multivariate jump-diﬀusion processes can provide a
convenient way to describe multivariate and correlated processes with jumps.

2.1. Multivariate jump-diﬀusion processes
On a complete probability space (Ω, F, P) with information ﬁltration (Ft ) we assume that Xt = ln(Vt ) is a Markov
process in some state space D ⊂ Rn such that it solves the stochastic diﬀerential equation [4]:
d Xt = μ(Xt )dt + σ(Xt )dWt + dZt ,
n

n

(4)
n×n

where W is an (Ft )-standard Brownian motion in R ; μ : D → R , σ : D → R , and Z is a pure jump process
whose jumps have a ﬁxed probability distribution ν on Rn such that they arrive with intensity {λ(Xt ) : t ≥ 0}, for
some λ : D → [0, ∞). Under these conditions, the above model is reduced to an aﬃne model and the theory of aﬃne
processes as a class of time-homogeneous Markov processes arising often in the context of applications in ﬁnance,
including credit risk modeling, has been developed in [5, 6]. What we are interested in our contribution is multivariate
transformed Brownian motions with jumps and in the estimation of the default rate of a ﬁrm during a given time
period. This problem is reduced to a ﬁrst passage time problem. The diﬃculties arise from the fact that the multiple
processes as well as their ﬁrst passage times are indeed correlated, so the simulation must reﬂect the correlations
of ﬁrst passage times. We propose a solution to circumvent these diﬃculties by combining the fast Monte-Carlo
method of one-dimensional jump-diﬀusion processes and the generation of correlated multidimensional variables,
generalizing previous results on non-correlated jump-diﬀusion situations.
Although for jump-diﬀusion processes, the closed form solutions are usually unavailable, between each two jumps
the process is a Brownian bridge for a univariate jump-diﬀusion process. In Atiya et al [2] the one-dimensional ﬁrst
passage time distribution has been deduced for time period [0, T ]. In order to evaluate multiple processes, we obtain
multi-dimensional formulas and reduce them to computable forms.
Therefore, we consider Nﬁrm ﬁrms Xt = [X1 , X2 , ..., XNﬁrm ]T , each Xi describes the process of individual ﬁrm i. We
may expect that each process Xi satisﬁes the following SDE:
dXi

μi dt +

=

σi j dW j + dZi
j

˜ i + dZi ,
μi dt + σi dW

=

(5)

˜ i is also a standard Brownian motion and σi is:
where W
σ2i j .

σi =
j

We assume that in the interval [0, T ], the total number of jumps for ﬁrm i is Mi . Let the jump instants be
T 1 , T 2 , · · · , T Mi . Let T 0 = 0 and T Mi +1 = T . The quantities τ j equal interjump times, which are T j − T j−1 . Following the notation of Atiya et al [2], let Xi (T −j ) be the process value immediately before the jth jump, and Xi (T +j ) be
the process value immediately after the jth jump. The jump-size is Xi (T +j ) − Xi (T −j ), and we can use such jump-sizes
to generate Xi (T +j ) sequentially.
Let Ai (t) be the event consisting of process Xi crossing the threshold level Di (t) for the ﬁrst time in the interval
[t, t + dt], then the conditional interjump ﬁrst passage density is deﬁned as [2]:
gi j (t) = P(Ai (t) ∈ dt|Xi (T +j−1 ), Xi (T −j )).

(6)

For ﬁrm i, after generating a series of ﬁrst passage times si , we use a kernel density estimator with Gaussian kernel
to estimate the ﬁrst passage time density (FPTD) f . Such kernels allow quite straightforward kernel combinations,
and therefore present a natural choice for a number of generalizations of the procedure described here. The kernel
density estimator is based on centering a kernel function of a bandwidth as follows:

The optimal bandwidth in the kernel function K can be calculated by using standard procedures (at least in the onedimensional case) and we do not focus on this here. However, we note that the kernel estimator for the multivariate
case involves the evaluation of the joint conditional interjump ﬁrst passage time density and the methodology for such
an evaluation is quite involved compared to the one-dimensional case.
3. The methodology of solution
First, let us recall the conventional Monte-Carlo procedure in application to the analysis of the evolution of ﬁrm
Xi within the time period [0, T ]. We divide the time period into n small intervals [0, t1 ], [t1 , t2 ], · · ·, [tn−1 , T ]. In
each Monte Carlo run, we need to calculate the value of Xi at each discretized time t. As usual, in order to exclude
discretization bias, the number n must be large. This procedure exhibits substantial computational diﬃculties when
applied to jump-diﬀusion processes. Indeed, for a typical jump-diﬀusion process, let T j−1 and T j be any successive
jump instants, as described above. Then, in the conventional Monte Carlo method, although there is no jump occurring
in the interval [T j−1 , T j ], yet we need to evaluate Xi at each discretized time t in [T j−1 , T j ]. This very time-consuming
procedure results in a serious shortcoming of the conventional Monte-Carlo methodology.
To remedy the situation, two modiﬁcations of the conventional procedure were recently proposed [2, 16] that
allow a potential speed-up of the conventional methodology of up to 10-30 times. One of the modiﬁcations, the
uniform sampling method, involves samplings using the uniform distribution. The other is the inverse Gaussian
density sampling method. Both methodologies were developed for the univariate case.
The major improvement of the UNIF method is based on the fact that it only evaluates Xi at generated jump
times, while between each two jumps the process is a Brownian bridge. Hence, we just consider the probability of
Xi crossing the threshold in (T j−1 , T j ) instead of evaluating Xi at each discretized time t. More precisely, in the UNIF
method, we assume that the values of Xi (T +j−1 ) and Xi (T −j ) are known as two end points of the Brownian bridge, the
probability that ﬁrm i defaults in (T j−1 , T j ) is 1 − Pi j which can easily be computed. Then we generate a variable
T j −T j−1
]. If the generated point si falls in the interjump
si from a distribution uniform in the interval [T j−1 , T j−1 + 1−P
ij
interval [T j−1 , T j ], then we have successfully generated the ﬁrst passage time si and can neglect the other intervals
and perform another Monte Carlo run. On the other hand, if the generated point si falls outside the interval [T j−1 , T j ]
(which happens with probability Pi j ), then that point is “rejected”. This means that no boundary crossing has occurred
in the interval, and we proceed to the next interval and repeat the whole process again.
In what follows, we focus on the further development of the UNIF method and extend it to multivariate and
correlated jump-diﬀusion processes. In order to implement the UNIF method for our multivariate model, we need to
consider several points:
1. We assume that the arrived jumps follow the Poisson process. The intensity λ of the Poisson process and the
distribution of (T j − T j−1 ) are the same for each ﬁrm. This assumption may not always be fulﬁlled as one may
argue that the intensity λ could be diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬁrms which implies that diﬀerent ﬁrms may endure
diﬀerent jump rates. However, in the real market economy once a ﬁrm (let us call it ”A”) encounters sudden
economic hazard, its correlated ﬁrms may also endure the same hazard. Furthermore, it is common that other
ﬁrms may help ﬁrm ”A” to pull out, which may result in a simultaneous jump for them. Therefore, as a ﬁrst
approximation, it is reasonable to employ the simultaneous jumps processes for all the diﬀerent ﬁrms.
2. As for the jump-size, we generate it by a given distribution which can be diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬁrms to reﬂect
speciﬁcs of the jump process for each ﬁrm. In the current contribution, we exemplify our description by considering an exponential distribution (mean value μT ) for (T j − T j−1 ) and a normal distribution (mean value μ J
and standard deviation σ J ) for the jump-size. We can use any other distribution when appropriate.
3. An array IsDefault (whose size is the number of ﬁrms denoted by Nﬁrm ) is used to indicate whether ﬁrm i has
defaulted in this Monte Carlo run. If the ﬁrm defaults, then we set IsDefault(i) = 1, and will not evaluate it
during this Monte Carlo run.
4. Most importantly, as we have mentioned before, the default events of ﬁrm i are inevitably correlated with other
ﬁrms, for example ﬁrm i + 1. The default correlation of ﬁrms i and i + 1 can easily be calculated. Hence, ﬁrm i’s
ﬁrst passage time si is indeed correlated with si+1 – the ﬁrst passage time of ﬁrm i + 1. We must generate several
T j −T j−1
] which is the key point for multivariate correlated processes.

Finally, we note that the default happening at time si also means that time si is exactly the ﬁrst passage time for
ﬁrm i. Therefore, the correlation of si and si+1 is the same as the default correlation of ﬁrms i and i + 1:
ρ(si , si+1 ) = ρi,i+1 (t) =

Pi (t) + Pi+1 (t) − Pi (t)Pi+1 (t) − Pi∪i+1 (t)

where in practice t can be chosen as the midpoint of the interval.

Next, we will give a brief description of the sum-of-uniforms method which is used to generate correlated uniform random variables, followed by the description of the multivariate and correlated UNIF method and the model
calibration.
3.1. Sum-of-uniforms method
In the above sections, we have reduced the solution of the original problem to a series of one-dimensional jumpdiﬀusion processes. The ﬁrst passage time distribution in an interval [T j−1 , T j ] (between two successive jumps) was
T j −T j−1
] whose correlations can

be described by Eq. (8).
T j −T j−1
Let us introduce a new variable bi j = 1−P
, then we have si = bi j Yi + T j−1 , where Yi is uniformly distributed in
ij
[0, 1]. Moreover, the correlation of Yi and Yi+1 equals ρ(si , si+1 ). Now we can generate the correlated uniform random
variables Y1 , Y2 , · · · by using the sum-of-uniforms (SOU) method [3, 17] in the following steps:
1. Generate Y1 from numbers uniformly distributed in [0, 1].
2. For i = 2, 3, · · ·, generate Wi ∼ U(0, ci−1,i ), where U(0, ci−1,i ) denotes a uniform random number over range
(0, ci−1,i ). Chen [3] has obtained the relationship of parameter ci−1,i and the correlation ρ(si−1 , si ) (abbreviated
as ρi−1,i ) as follows:

By carrying out the above two steps, we can generate correlated uniform random variables Y1 , Y2 ,..., leading
to the relationship si = bi j Yi + T j−1 whose correlations automatically satisfy Eq. (8). Note also that ρ(si , si+1 )
should be computed before generating the correlated uniform random variables Y1 , Y2 ,..., and hence, in a practical
implementation, we should approximate time t where ρ(si , si+1 ) is computed as discussed. One such possible choice
has already been mentioned above and, from a practical point of view, it will work well as long as ρ(si , si+1 ) is a slowly
varying function in [T j−1 , T j ].

3.2. Uniform sampling method
In this subsection, we will describe our algorithm for multivariate jump-diﬀusion processes, which is an extension
of the one-dimensional case developed earlier by other authors (e.g. Atiya et al [2], Metwally et al [16]).
Consider Nﬁrm ﬁrms in the given time period [0, T ]. First, we generate the jump instant T j by generating interjump
times (T j − T j−1 ) and set all the IsDefault(i) = 0 (i = 1, 2, · · · , Nﬁrm ) to indicate that no ﬁrm has defaulted at the
beginning.
Note that for each process Xi we can make the following observations:
1. If no jump occurs, as described by Eq. (5), the interjump size (Xi (T −j ) − Xi (T +j−1 )) follows a normal distribution
of mean μi (T j − T j−1 ) and standard deviation σi T j − T j−1 . We get
Xi (T −j ) ∼
∼

Nﬁrm

Xi (T +j−1 ) + μi (T j − T j−1 ) +

k=1

σik T j − T j−1 Wi ,

where the initial state is Xi (0) = Xi (T 0+ ).
2. If a jump occurs, we simulate the jump-size by a normal distribution or another distribution when appropriate,
and compute the postjump value:
Xi (T +j ) = Xi (T −j ) + Zi (T j ).
This completes the procedure for generating beforejump and postjump values Xi (T −j ) and Xi (T +j ), respectively. As
before, j = 1, · · · , M where M is the total number of jumps for all the ﬁrms. We compute Pi j . To recur the ﬁrst
passage time density (FPTD) fi (t), we have to consider three possible cases that may occur for each non-default ﬁrm
i:
1. First passage happens inside the interval. We know that if Xi (T +j−1 ) > Di (T j−1 ) and Xi (T −j ) < Di (T j ), then
the ﬁrst passage happened in the time interval [T j−1 , T j ]. To evaluate when the ﬁrst passage happened, we
T j −T j−1
. We generate several correlated uniform numbers Yi by using the
introduce a new variable bi j as bi j = 1−P
ij
SOU method as described in Section 3.1, then compute si = bi j Yi + T j−1 . If si belongs to interval [T j−1 , T j ], then
the ﬁrst passage time occurred in this interval. We set IsDefault(i) = 1 to indicate that ﬁrm i has defaulted
and compute the conditional boundary crossing density gi j (si ). To get the density for the entire interval [0, T ],
we use fi,n (t) =

T j −T j−1
1−Pi j

gi j (si ) ∗ K(hopt , t − si ), where n is the iteration number of the Monte Carlo cycle.

2. First passage does not happen in this interval. If si does not belong to interval [T j−1 , T j ], then the ﬁrst passage
time has not yet occurred in this interval.
3. First passage happens at the right boundary of the interval. If Xi (T +j ) < Di (T j ) and Xi (T −j ) > Di (T j ), then T Ii
is the ﬁrst passage time and Ii = j, we evaluate the density function using kernel function fi,n (t) = K(hopt , t−T Ii ),
and set IsDefault(i) = 1.
Next, we increase j and examine the next interval and analyze the above three cases for each non-default ﬁrm
N
again. After running N times the Monte Carlo cycle, we get the FPTD of ﬁrm i as fi (t) = N1 n=1
fi,n (t).
3.3. Model calibration and concluding remarks on the developed methodology
We need to calibrate the developed model that is to numerically choose or optimize the parameters, and in the
speciﬁc case of the credit analysis these parameters include drift, volatility and jumps to ﬁt the most liquid market
data.
As already mentioned, after Monte Carlo simulation we obtain the estimated density fˆi (t) by using the kernel
estimator method. Then we minimize the diﬀerence between our model and historical default data Ai (t) to obtain the
optimized parameters in the model (such as σi j , arrival intensity λ in Eq. (5)):

Note that in practice, the generated by using SOU method si are not obtained according to the conditional boundary
crossing density gi j (si ). Instead, in order to obtain an appropriate density estimate, the right hand side summation in
Eq. (7) can be viewed as a ﬁnite sample estimate in a way proposed by Atiya et al [2]. For the multidimensional
density estimate, we need to evaluate the joint conditional boundary crossing density. This problem can be divided into
several one-dimensional density estimation subproblems if the processes are non-correlated [18]. As for the general
case of multivariate correlated processes, the joint density is not available analytically and numerical approximations
are necessary for diﬀerent classes of special cases. Before moving to speciﬁc examples, demonstrating numerical
eﬃciency of the developed methodology, we remark that the developed method belongs to the class of methodologies
based on Brownian bridge simulations or more generally large deviations methodologies. In several special cases,
recent theoretical results on estimating barrier crossing probabilities of the associated Brownian bridges are available
in the literature (with upper and lower limits). With a few exceptions, most such results concern one-dimensional
Brownian bridges only [16, 13] for further details on these issues.
4. Applications and discussion
Our ﬁrst task is to describe the ﬁrst passage time density functions (based on which we can determine default rates
of the corresonding ﬁrms). Since there is no option value that can be used, we will employ Eq.(9) to optimize the
parameters in our model. For convenience, we reduce the number of optimizing parameters by:
1. Setting Xi (0) = 2 and ln(κi ) = 0.
2. Setting the growth rate γi of debt value equivalent to the growth rate μi of the ﬁrm’s value [20], so the default
of ﬁrm is non-sensitive to μi . In our computations, we set μi = −0.001.
3. The interjump times (T j − T j−1 ) satisfy an exponential distribution with mean value equal to 1.
4. The arrival rate for jumps satisﬁes the Poisson distribution with intensity parameter λ, where the jump size is a
normal distribution Zi ∼ N(μZi , σZi ).

As a result, we only need to optimize σi , λ, μZi , σZi for each ﬁrm. This is done by minimizing the diﬀerences
between our simulated default rates and historical data. Moreover, as mentioned above, we will use the same arrival
rate λ and distribution of (T j − T j−1 ) for diﬀerently rated ﬁrms, so we ﬁrst optimize four parameters for, e.g., the
A-rated ﬁrm, and then set the parameter λ of other three ﬁrms the same as A’s.
The minimization was performed by using the quasi-Newton procedure implemented as a Scilab program. The
optimized parameters for each diﬀerently rated ﬁrm were found by using the UNIF method. In each step of the
optimization we choose the Monte Carlo runs N = 50, 000.
By using the optimized parameters, we carried out the ﬁnal simulation with Monte Carlo runs N = 500, 000. The
estimated ﬁrst passage time density function of these four ﬁrms are shown in Fig. 1 (top). The simulated cumulative
default rates (line) together with historical data (squares) are given in Fig. 1 (bottom). The theoretical data denoted as
circles in Fig. 1 (bottom) were computed by using Eq. (3) where the Zi were evaluated in [20] as 8.06, 6.46, 3.73 and
2.10 for A-, Baa-, Ba- and B-rated ﬁrms, respectively.
From Fig. 1, we can conclude that the density functions of A- and Baa-rated ﬁrms still have the trend to increase,
which means the default rates of A- and Baa-rated ﬁrms may increase little faster in future. As for Ba- and B-rated
ﬁrms, their density functions have decreased, so their default rates may increase very slowly or be kept at a constant
level. Mathematically speaking, the cumulative default rates of A- and Baa-rated ﬁrms are convex function, while the
cumulative default rates of Ba- and B-rated ﬁrms are concave.
5. Conclusion
In this contribution, we develop a fast Monte-Carlo type procedure for the analysis of complex systems such
as those occurring in the ﬁnancial market. As an example, we have analyzed the credit risk problems of multiple
correlated ﬁrms in a structural model framework, where we incorporated jumps to reﬂect the external shocks or
other unpredicted events. Our new procedure was developed by combining the fast Monte-Carlo method for onedimensional jump-diﬀusion processes and the generation of correlated multidimensional variates. This allows us to
analyze multivariate and correlated jump-diﬀusion processes. The developed approach generalizes further previously
