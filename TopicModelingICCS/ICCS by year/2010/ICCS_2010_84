Abstract
This paper presents the latest developments of the deterministic Macroscopic Cellular Automata model SCIARA for simulating
lava flows. A Bingham-like rheology has been introduced for the first time as part of the Minimization Algorithm of the
Differences, which is applied for computing lava outflows from the generic cell towards its neighbours. The hexagonal cellular
space adopted in the previous releases of the model for mitigating the anisotropic flow direction problem has been replaced by a Moore neighbourhood - square one, nevertheless by producing an even better solution for the anisotropic effect. Furthermore,
many improvements have been introduced concerning the important modelling aspect of lava cooling. The model has been tested
with encouraging results by considering both a real case of study, the 2006 lava flows at Mt Etna (Italy), and an ideal surface,
namely a 5° inclined plane, in order to evaluate the magnitude of the anisotropic effect. As a matter of fact, notwithstanding a
preliminary calibration, the model demonstrated to be more accurate than its predecessors, providing the best results ever
obtained on the simulation of the considered real case of study. Eventually, experiments performed on the inclined plane have
pointed out how this release of SCIARA does not present the typical anisotropic problem of deterministic Cellular Automata
models for fluids on ideal surfaces.

Besides theoretical studies [5], CA have been applied to a variety of fields such as pattern recognition [6,7], image
processing [8] and cryptography [9]. However, major interest for CA regard their use in Complex Systems
modelling in various fields like Physics, Biology, Earth Sciences and Engineering (see e.g. [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]).
For instance, physicists and biologists are applying CA in their domains due to the fact that, although having a
simple structure, they show a rich dynamical behaviour, which is typical of real systems. Among diverse practical
usages, Fluid-dynamics is an important field of application for CA. In Physics, Lattice Gas Automata models [17]
were introduced for describing the motion and collision of “particles” on a grid. It was shown that such models can
simulate fluid dynamical properties. The continuum limit of these models leads to the Navier-Stokes equations.
Lattice Gas models can be regarded as “microscopic” models, as they describe the motion of fluid “particles” actually “fluid tokens” - which interact by scattering. An advantage of Lattice Gas models is that the simplicity of
particles, and of their interactions, allow for the simulation of a large number of them, making it therefore possible
to observe the emergence of flow patterns. A different approach characterises the so-called Lattice Boltzmann
models [18,19] in which the state variables can take continuous values, as they are supposed to represent the density
of fluid particles, endowed with certain properties, located in each cell (here space and time are discrete, as in lattice
gas models). Both Lattice Gas and Lattice Boltzmann Models have been applied for the description of fluid
turbulence (cf. [11,16]).
On the other hand, many complex natural phenomena evolve on very large areas and are therefore difficult to be
modelled at a microscopic level of description. Among these, lava flows can be considered, at the same time, one of
the most dangerous and difficult phenomena to be modelled as, for instance, temperature drops along the path by
locally modifying the magma dynamical behaviour (because of the effect of the strong temperature-dependence of
viscosity – see e.g. [20]). Lava flows generally evolve on complex topographies that can change during eruptions,
due to lava solidification, and are often characterised by branching and rejoining of the flow. Furthermore, they are
generally characterized by non-Newtonian rheology and there is a not complete agreement about their governing
dynamics and parameters among Researchers.
Nevertheless, many attempts of modelling real cases can be found in literature. Crisci and co-workers were the
first to adopt CA for modelling Etnean lava flows (Italy) through the numerical simulation code SCIARA, initially
fully three-dimensional [21] and subsequently reduced to a two-dimensional CA [22], while Ishihara et al. [23] were
the first to adopt a Binghamian rheology in a CA numerical code, with good results on the simulation of some lava
flows in Japan. Subsequently, Miyamoto and Sasaki [24] proposed a non-deterministic CA model that, thanks to a
Monte Carlo approach, did not present the anisotropic problem due to the discretization of the considered (square)
cellular space. Afterwards, a similar - non deterministic - approach was adopted by Vicari et al. [25] by the CA
model MAGFLOW with good results on the simulation of Etnean lava flows (cf. also [26,27]).
In this paper, we present the latest release of the CA model SCIARA, which differs with respect to its
predecessor as it re-introduces square cells and adopts a Bingham-like rheology. The model showed to be able to
reproduce Etnean lava flows with high accuracy, also keeping the great computational efficiency that characterised
the previous releases (cf.[28]). Furthermore, although the model is fully deterministic, it showed a substantial
asymmetry-free dynamics on ideal surfaces, which we attribute to both the effect of the considered rheological
model and to some improvements in the considered flow distribution algorithms.
In the next section Macroscopic Cellular Automata are briefly described, while the new SCIARA model is
illustrated in Section 3. Section 4 shows the results of the application of SCIARA to a real case occurred on Mt
Etna, while Section 5 illustrates the dynamical behaviour of the model on an ideal surface. The last section
concludes the paper with a general discussion and suggestions for future works.
2. Macroscopic Cellular Automata
Classical homogeneous Cellular Automata can be viewed as an n-dimensional space, subdivided in cells of
uniforms shape and size. Each cell embeds an identical finite automaton (fa), whose state accounts for the temporary
features of the cell; Q is the finite set of states. The fa input is given by the states of a set of neighbouring cells,
including the central cell itself. The neighbourhood conditions are determined by a geometrical pattern, X, which is
invariant in time and space. The fa have an identical state transition function τ:Q#X→Q, which is simultaneously
applied to each cell. At step t=0, fa are in arbitrary states and the CA evolves by changing the state of all fa
simultaneously at discrete times, according to τ. Formally, a homogeneous CA is a 4-tuple:

A = < R, X, Q, τ >
Regarding the modelling of some natural complex phenomena, Crisci and co-workers proposed an extended
notion of homogeneous CA, firstly applied to the simulation of basaltic lava flows [21], which makes the modelling
of spatially extended systems more straightforward and overcomes some unstated limits of the classical CA such as
having few states and look-up table transition functions (cf. [29]). Mainly for this reason, the method is known as
Macroscopic Cellular Automata (MCA). MCA were in fact adopted for the simulation of many macroscopic
phenomena, such as lava flows [28], debris flows [13], density currents [30,31], water flux in unsaturated soils [32],
soil erosion/degradation by rainfall [33,34] as well as pyroclastic flows [35], bioremediation processes [14,36] and
forest fires [37]. Nevertheless, despite the name, MCA have also been employed for the modelling of systems at
micro/meso-scopic levels of description [38,39]. Formally, a MCA is a 7-tuple:
A = < R, X, Q, P, τ, G, γ >
where, equivalently to the homogeneous CA definition, R, Q, X and τ are the n-dimensional cellular space, the set of
states of the cell, the geometrical pattern that specifies the neighbourhood relationship, and the fa transition function.
Nevertheless, the set Q of state of the cell is decomposed in substates, Q1, Q2,..., Qr, each one representing a
particular feature of the phenomenon to be modelled. The overall state of the cell is thus obtained as the Cartesian
product of the considered substates:
Q = Q1×Q2× ... ×Qr
A set of parameters, P={p1, p2,..., pp}, is furthermore considered, which allow to “tune” the model for
reproducing different dynamical behaviours of the phenomenon of interest. As the set of state is split in substates,
also the state transition function τ is split in elementary processes, τ1, τ2, ..., τs, each one describing a particular
aspect that rules the dynamic of the considered phenomenon. Eventually, G⊂R is a subset of the cellular space that
is subject to external influences, specified by the supplementary function γ. External influences were introduced in
order to model features which are not easy to be described in terms of local interactions.
As stated above, many geological processes like lava or debris flows can be described in terms of local
interactions and thus modelled by MCA. By opportunely discretizing the surface on which the phenomenon evolves,
the dynamics of the system can be in fact described in terms of flows of some quantity from one cell to the
neighbouring ones. Moreover, as the cell dimension is a constant value throughout the cellular space, it is possible to
consider characteristics of the cell (i.e. substates), typically expressed in terms of volume (e.g. lava volume), in
terms of thickness. This simple assumption permits to adopt a straightforward but efficacious strategy that computes
outflows from the central cell to the neighbouring ones in order to minimize the non-equilibrium conditions.
Historically, in the MCA approach, outflows have mainly been computed by procedures based on one of two
“distribution” algorithms: the Minimisation Algorithm of the Differences (cf. [29]), and the Proportional
Distribution Algorithm (cf. [40]). The first algorithm, here adopted, is briefly described in the next section.
2.1. The Minimization Algorithm of the Differences
The Minimisation Algorithm of the Differences (MAD) is based on the following assumptions:
• two parts of the considered quantity must be identified in the central cell: these are the unmovable part, u(0), and
the mobile part, m;
• only m can be distributed to the adjacent cells. Let f(x, y) denote the flow from cell x to cell y; m can be written
as:

m=

#X

¦ f (0, i)
i =0

where f(0, 0) is the part which is not distributed, and #X is the number of cells belonging to the X neighbourhood;
• the quantities in the adjacent cells, u(i) (i = 1, 2, ...,#X) are considered unmovable;
• let c(i) = u(i)+f(0,i) (i=0,1,...,#X) be the new quantity content in the i-th neighbouring cell after the distribution;
let cmin be the minimum value of c(i) (i=0,1,...,#X). The outflows are computed in order to minimise the following
expression:

The MAD operates as follows:
1. the following average is computed:

a=

i∈ A

u (i )

#A

where A is the set of not eliminated cells (i.e. those that can receive a flow); note that at the first step #A = #X;
2. cells for which u(i)  a (i = 0, 1, ...,#X) are eliminated from the flow distribution and from the subsequent average
computation;
3. the first two points are repeated until no cells are eliminated; finally, the flow from the central cell towards the ith neighbour is computed as the difference between u(i) and the last average value a:

­a − u (i ) i ∈ A
f (0, i ) = ®
i∉ A
¯ 0
Note that the simultaneous application of the minimization principle to each cell gives rise to the global
equilibrium of the system. The correctness of the algorithm is stated in [29], i.e. it minimizes equation (1). Finally, a
relaxation rate, rr ∈ [0, 1], can be introduced, denoting that the equilibrium conditions may not be reached in a
single CA step; the obtained values of outflows are therefore multiplied by rr (if rr=1, no relaxation is induced; if
rr=0, there will be no outflows towards the neighbourhood).
3. The computational model
As stated in Section 1, a Bingham-like rheology has been introduced for the first time in SCIARA in spite of the
previous simplified rheological model in which viscosity effects and critical height were modelled in terms of lava
adherence. In this previous simplified model, depending on temperature, a fixed amount of lava cannot flow out
from the cell, while the part that moves is determined by a version of the Minimization Algorithm of the Differences
that does not consider the effect of viscosity (being the relaxation rate set to 1 - c.f. [28]).
Conversely, the rheology here adopted is inspired to the Bingham model and therefore the concepts of critical
height and viscosity are explicitly considered. In particular, lava can flow out if and only if its thickness overcomes
a critical value (critical height), so that the basal stress exceeds the yield strength. Moreover, viscosity is accounted
in terms of flow relaxation rate, being this latter the parameter of the distribution algorithm that influences the
amount of lava that actually leaves the cell.

In formal terms, SCIARA is defined as:
SCIARA= < R, L, X, Q, P, τ, γ >
where:
• R is the set of square cells covering the bi-dimensional finite region where the phenomenon evolves;
• L ∈ R specifies the lava source cells (i.e. craters);
• X = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 1), (-1,-1), (1, -1), (1, 1)} identifies the pattern of cells (Moore
neighbourhood) that influence the cell state change; in the following we will refer to cells by indexes 0 (for the
central cell) through 8, as shown in Fig 1;
• Q = Qz × Qh × QT × Qf8 is the finite set of states, considered as Cartesian product of “substates”. Their meanings
are: cell altitude a.s.l., cell lava thickness, cell lava temperature, and lava thickness outflows (from the central cell
toward the four adjacent cells), respectively;
• P={w, t, Tsol, Tvent, rTsol, rTvent, hcTsol, hcTvent, δ, ρ, ε, σ, cv} is the finite set of parameters (invariant in time and
space) which affect the transition function; their meaning is illustrated in Table 1;
• τ : Q7 ĺ Q is the cell deterministic transition function; it is outlined in the following sections;
• γ : Qh × N ĺ Qh specifies the emitted lava thickness from the source cells at each step k ∈ N (N is the set of
natural numbers).

Fig. 2. Reference schema for cells altitude determination in the Moore neighbourhood. Altitudes of cells along the von Neumann
neighbourhood correspond to DEM values. Those along diagonals are taken at the intersection between the diagonal line and the circle with
radius w (cf. Table 1), so that the distance with respect to the centre of the central cell is constant for each adjacent neighbour.

Fig. 3. Cases in which the generic neighbour (cell i) is not eliminated by the Minimisation Algorithm of the Difference and can thus receive a
flow by the central cell (cell 0). Note that the slope angle ϑ , considered in the critical height computation, depends on the particular case.

3.1. Elementary processτ1: lava flows computation
As stated above, viscosity is modelled in terms of flow relaxation rate, r, according to a power law of the kind:
log r = a+bT

(2)

where T∈QT is the lava temperature and the a and b coefficients determined by solving the system (cf. Table 1):

­log rTsol = a + bTsol
®
¯log rTvent = a + bTvent
Similarly, critical height mainly depends on lava temperature according to a power law of the kind:
log hc = c+dT

(3)

whose coefficients are obtained by solving the system (cf. Table 1):

­log hcTsol = c + dTsol
®
¯log hcTvent = c + dTvent
In order to apply the Minimisation Algorithm of the Differences to compute lava outflows from the central cell
(which has index 0 – cf Fig. 1) to the i-th neighbour, a preliminary control is performed for “eliminating” cells that
cannot receive lava due their state condition. If zi ∈Qz is the topographic altitude and hi∈Qh the lava thickness (i=0,
1, ..., #X), the generic cell i is not eliminated exclusively in the following two cases:
1) z 0 > zi ∧ h0  hi, i.e. both the topographic altitude of the central cell is greater than that of the neighbouring
cell and the debris thickness of the central cell is greater than or equal to that of the neighbouring cell;
2) ( z 0 + h0 > z i + hi) ∧ ¬( z 0 > zi ∧ h0  hi), i.e. the “total height” of the central cell overcomes that of the
neighbouring cell, and case1) is false.
In order to solve the anisotropic problem, a fictitious topographic alteration along diagonal cells is considered
with respect to those “individuated” by the DEM. In a standard situation of non-altered heights, cells along
diagonals result in a lower elevation with respect to the remaining ones (which belong to the von Neumann
neighbourhood), even in case of constant slope. This is due to the fact that the distance between the central cell and
diagonal neighbours is greater than of the distance between the central cell and orthogonal adjacent cells (cf. Fig. 2).
This introduces a side effect in the distribution algorithm, which operates on the basis of height differences. If the
algorithm perceives a greater difference along diagonals, it will erroneously privilege them by producing greater
outflows. In order to solve this problem, we consider the height of diagonal neighbours taken at the intersection
between the diagonal line and the circle with radius w (cf. Table 1) centred in the centre of the central cell (Fig. 2).
Under the commonly assumed hypothesis of inclined plane between adjacent cells (cf. [25]), this solution permits to
have constant differences in level in correspondence of constant slopes, and the distribution algorithm can work
properly even on the Moore neighbourhood. According to this strategy, the topographic altitude in the previous case
1) and case 2) conditions is (cf. also Fig. 1):

Case 1) indicates the situation in which lava moves downslope and a lower amount of lava is found in the
neighbouring cell. In this case, lava in the neighbour does not represent an obstacle. Consequently, the distribution
algorithm considers only the topographic elevation of the neighbour as unmovable part u(i) (cf. Section 2.1) and the
slope angle, ϑ , is computed accordingly (cf. Fig. 3 - CASE 1).
Case 2) indicates the situation in which lava moves down or up-slope and lava in the neighbouring cell represents
an obstacle. In fact, if z 0 > z i (lava moves downslope), hi > h0 must hold, which can indicate a situation where lava
motion is slowing down, for instance due to cooling or because a counter-slope begins (cf. Fig. 3 - CASE 2a). Still,
if z 0 < z i , lava moves upslope and both neighbouring altitude and lava content oppose to lava motion (cf. Fig. 3 CASE 2b). In these cases, the distribution algorithm considers both the topographic elevation and lava content of the
neighbours as u(i) (cf. Section 2.1) and the slope angle, ϑ , is computed accordingly (cf. Fig. 3 - CASE 2a and CASE
2b).
As a result, in order to compute lava outflows from the central cell towards its neighbours, the Minimisation
Algorithm of the Differences is applied to the following quantities:

m= h0;

The application of the algorithm determines the computation of flows f(0,i) from the central cell to the i-th
neighbour. According to the Bingham-like rheology here adopted, actual lava outflows, h(0,i), are computed as:

­ f (0, i ) ⋅ r h0 > hc ⋅ cos ϑ
h(0, i ) = ®
h0 ≤ hc ⋅ cos ϑ
¯0
being ϑ the slope angle, as shown in Fig. 3. The relaxation rate factor, r, computed according to equation (2), here
plays the role of the viscosity in the context of the Minimization Algorithm, while the critical height, hc, computed
according to equation (3), has the same meaning as that of a Bingham fluid.
3.2. Elementary processτ2: temperature variation and lava solidification
A two step process determines the new cell lava temperature. In the first one, the temperature is obtained as
weighted average of residual lava inside the cell and lava inflows from neighbouring ones:
6
hr T0 + i =1 h(i,0)Ti
Tavg =
6
hr + i =1 h(i,0)
where hr ∈ Qh is the residual lava thickness inside the central cell after the outflows distribution, T ∈ QT is the lava
temperature and h(i,0) the lava inflow from the i-th neighbouring cell. Note that h(i,0) is equal to the lava outflow
from the i-th neighbouring cell towards the central one, computed by means of the Minimisation Algorithm. A
further step updates the calculated temperature by considering thermal energy loss due to lava surface radiation [41]:

where ε, σ, t, δ, ρ, cv and w are the lava emissivity, the Stephan-Boltzmann constant, the CA clock, the cooling
parameter, the lava density, the specific heat and the cell side, respectively (cf. Table 1).
When the lava temperature drops below the threshold Tsol, lava solidifies. Consequently, the cell altitude
increases by an amount equal to lava thickness and new lava thickness is set to zero.

between real and simulated events; 4) lava vents sources. The effusion rate is shown in the upper right corner of the figure.

4. First simulations at Mt Etna: the 2006 Valle del Bove Lava Flow
Etna’s July 2006 eruption began during the night of 14 July, when a fissure opened on the east flank of the SouthEast Crater. Two vents (cf. key 4 of Fig. 4) fed lava flow towards east into the Valle del Bove. The effusion rate
trend here adopted is in agreement with that considered by Neri et al. [42] and is shown in Fig. 4.
A preliminary calibration allowed to individuate values for model’s parameters, which are listed in Table 1. The
corresponding CA simulation, performed on a 10m cell size DEM of 797 columns and 517 rows, is shown in Fig. 4.
In order to quantitatively evaluate the goodness of our simulation, we adopted the e1 fitness function, which provides
a measure of the overlapping (in terms of areal extent) between the real and simulated event. Let us denote with R
and S the sets of CA cells affected by the real and simulated event, respectively. Let m(R ŀ S) and m(R ‫ ׫‬S) be the
measure of their intersection and union, respectively. The fitness function e1 is defined as follows:

e1 =

m (R ∩ S )
m (R ∪ S )

Note that the function e1 gives values belonging to the interval [0, 1]. Its value is 0 if the actual and simulated
events are completely disjoint, being m(R ŀ S) = 0; it is 1 in case of a perfect overlap, being m(R ŀ S) = m(R ‫ ׫‬S).
As the Fig. 4 shows, the simulation does not differ significantly from the real case, as confirmed by the more than
satisfying value of the fitness function, e1 = 0.8. The goodness of the simulation is also confirmed in terms of runout, as the travelled distance from the sources of the simulated event is practically the same as the real one.
5. Simulations on ideal surfaces
In general, deterministic CA for the simulation of macroscopic fluids present a strong dependence on the cell
geometry and directions of the cellular space. We have already evidenced that, due to the discretization of the
surface where the phenomenon evolves, diagonal cells can be greatly privileged in flow distribution and thus lava
can spread preferentially in these directions.
In order to solve the problem, different solutions have been proposed in literature, such as the adoption of
hexagonal cells (e.g. [12,43,44]) or Monte Carlo approaches (e.g. [24,25]). The first solution, however, does not
solve perfectly the problem on ideal surfaces, while the second one has the disadvantage of giving rise to nondeterministic simulation models.

Fig. 5. SCIARA simulations on an octagonal-base pyramid with faces inclined by an angle α = 5°, performed for evaluating the anisotropic
flow direction problem: a) case in which actual cell topographic elevations are considered; b) case in which equation (4) is applied and
topographic corrections along diagonals considered. Note that the square lattice in both figures is only indicative of the cellular space orientation
and does not correspond to the actual cellular space in terms of number of rows and columns.

Here we show that the present deterministic release of SCIARA does not present the anisotropic problem on an
ideal surface, represented by an octagonal-base pyramid having faces inclined by an angle α = 5°. The pyramid is
represented by a 10m cell size DEM of 203 columns and 203 rows. By locating the lava source at the top of the
structure, both flows along diagonals and orthogonal directions of the square cellular space are observed. Figure 5
shows the results of two test cases in which a constant effusion rate, equal to 1 m3s-1, is emitted for a total of 6 days,
and no temperature loss is considered. The first simulation is obtained by considering the actual topographic heights
of the cells, while the second by taking into account the topographic corrections discussed in section 3.1 - cf.
equation (4). As it can be seen, the anisotropic problem is quite significant in the first case, in which diagonal flows,
as expected, reach the base of the pyramid more rapidly with respect to those on the orthogonal directions. In the
second case, in which topographic alteration are considered, the problem is practically absent and all flows reach the
base of the pyramid at the same moment.
6. Discussion
We have presented the latest release of the Macroscopic Cellular Automata model SCIARA for simulating lava
flows. For the first time in the SCIARA family of lava flows models, this release considers a Bingham-like
rheology. Moreover, it re-introduces a square tessellation of the cellular space instead of the previously adopted
hexagonal one, which was considered in the earlier versions to limit the effect of the anisotropic flow direction
problem. Notwithstanding, we have shown that the model is able to solve the problem on an ideal inclined surface.
This result is particularly significant, being SCIARA a deterministic model, as all the previously proposed solutions
refer to probabilistic CA simulation models.
A preliminary calibration also allowed to reproduce a real case of study, namely the 2006 lava flows at Mt Etna
(Italy), with a great level of accuracy. In fact, a high degree of overlapping between the real and the simulated event
and a perfect fitting in terms of run-out were obtained.
Anyhow, these encouraging preliminary results need to be confirmed by further analysis. First of all, a more
thorough calibration phase is required, together with a related validation one, in order to assess the validity and
reliability of the model in simulating real cases of study. A further sensitivity analysis must also be performed for
evaluating, in particular, the numerical stability of the model. Eventually, further tests on different ideal surfaces,
e.g. planes with different inclinations, should be performed in order to better evaluate the behaviour of the model
with respect flow anisotropy.
