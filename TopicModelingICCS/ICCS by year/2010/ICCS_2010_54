This paper presents a new optimum model to reflect the strategic assets allocation of SWFs. According to the risk value of assets of SWFs,
it can be classified into four kinds of assets listed as high risk asset, middle risk asset, low risk asset and risk free asset. Thus the
optimization model will be developed to decide the corresponding weight number of above four classified assets including maximum
CRRA utility and minimum VAR objectives subject to some subjective and objective conditions. In the last, a numerical simulation will be
drawn to achieve the Pareto solutions to illustrate the application of developed model by using NSGA-II.

1. Introduction
Sovereign wealth funds(SWFs) [1,2]are financial vehicles owned by states which hold, manage or administer public funds,
which can be invested in a wider range of assets of various kinds. Their funds are mainly derived from excess liquidity in the
public sector stemming from government fiscal surpluses or from official reserves at central banks. SWFs can be categorized
into two types of funds according to their primary purpose. On the one hand, so-called stabilization funds aim to even out the
budgetary and fiscal policies of a country via separating them from short-term budgetary or reserve developments which may
be caused by price changes in the underlying markets, i.e. in oil or minerals, but also in foreign exchange conditions. On the
other hand, savings or intergenerational funds create a store of wealth for future generations by using the assets they are
allocated to spread the returns on a country‚Äôs natural resources across generations in an equitable manner. Private analysts
[3,4]
put current sovereign wealth fund assets in the range of $2 to 3 trillion or even higher. This amount is projected to grow to
as much as $13 trillion in the next ten years, an amount larger than the current global stock of foreign reserves of about $6
trillion.
Alongside the growth in their number and size, sovereign wealth funds have also sought to diversify their investments
across asset classes and geographies in the pursuit of higher returns. SWFs can be expected to adopt a long-term approach to

their investment and spending decisions, differ from traditional institutional investors such as investment and pension funds
or insurance companies. SWF‚Äôs should diversify their holdings between a risk adjusted portfolio comprised of stocks, bonds,
and alternative investments. Due to their nature as guardians of national wealth, We believe SWFs‚Äô longer investment
horizons should also allow them to adopt a higher risk-taking posture, and possibly a greater tolerance for market and
liquidity risk. Morgan Stanley believes it is useful to consider the portfolios of established Sovereign Pension Funds (SPFs)
as ‚Äòmodel portfolios‚Äô, in terms of their asset structure. Their judgment is that 25% bonds, 45% equities, and 30% alternative
investments are a likely targeted portfolio structure for many SWFs. Norges Bank‚Äôs GPF is a good example. As it has
matured, it has raised its exposure to equities and alternative investments. The growing size and the long-term nature of their
investment permit the NBIM to try to capitalize on the liquidity premium by entering into less liquid, but higher return
investments. Other SWFs will follow the same path.
This paper presents a new optimum model to reflect the strategic assets allocation of SWFs based on the perspective of
utility. According to the risk value of assets of SWFs, it can be classified into four kinds of assets listed as high risk asset,
middle risk asset, low risk asset and risk free asset. Thus the optimization model will be developed to decide the
corresponding weight number of above four classified assets including maximum CRRA utility and minimum VAR
objectives subject to some subjective and objective conditions. In the last, a numerical simulation will be drawn to achieve
the Pareto solutions to illustrate the application of developed model by using NSGA-II.
2. Strategic asset allocation of SWFs
Asset allocation decision of Sovereign wealth funds includes strategic asset allocation(SAA) and tactical asset
allocation(TAA) that is allocate sovereign wealth in all asset classes in order to disperse risk, ensure return. Strategic asset
allocation decision reflects long-term investment objectives and policy, determines optimize allocation proportions of each
asset class (bonds, equities, alternative investment) in initial term , which is the most important decision that control total
investment risk and meet investment return objectives. Tactical asset allocation is a again balance to strategic asset portfolio
for purposes of excess return enhancement in plan investment term on lock up or reduce short and medium-term investment
loss base on ensure implement long-term investment objectives. A extent literatures indicates that asset allocation decision ,
especially strategic asset allocation decision , has a very important role in investment management process, both qualitative
analysis and quantitative analysis. figure 1 shows investment portfolio performance contribution of different factors.

Around the world , sovereign wealth funds have switched focus away from buying into fixed income bond of G7 country
towards globality diversified investments combination includes stock, alternative investment and other risk asset. Current
asset allocation of Sovereign wealth funds almost have involved all of investment instrument. The sovereign wealth fund has
utilized a variety of routes to market to achieve diversification.
x Cash asset
Though cash asset is safety in short, has risk in long. Because Sovereign wealth funds hold cash asset which must renew
investment with unknown real interest rate in future, expect stabilization funds with liquidity demand , other funds all hold
cash asset in very low proportion.
x Fixed Income
Public debt securities has the most security, but which has less return and very sensitivity to risk of interest rate, especially
middle-long-term public debt securities which can be traded, slightly change of interest rate will arose volatilities of traded
price. Thus recently Sovereign wealth funds have greatly reduced asset allocation proportion of Public debt securities.

Because institution debt securities have relatively default risk, Sovereign wealth funds firstly need consider whose credit
rating in allocation asset. Sovereign wealth funds commonly have strict request and regulate to institution debt securities‚Äôs
credit rating for purposes of investment security.
x Equities
Because the risk-return characteristics of equities fit the demand of long-term institution investor, Equities necessity has a
very important role in strategic asset allocation of Sovereign wealth funds. Different funds may determine the most suitability
equities investment pattern and propriety asset allocation proportion base on investment objectives and constraints in
consideration of oneself‚Äôs features. Emphasize on, people commonly believe the average return of stock will excess the
average return of bonds, but people rarely know the risk of stock is lower than the risk of bonds, indeed is lower than the risk
of treasury.A recent study indicates that stock never had given investor negative buy-and-hold returns into a investment
perspective over twenty years, compared to bond and treasury. Though the real returns of the stock in short term is more
acuity fluctuate than the returns of bond and treasury, along with extend investment period, the fluctuated interval of the
stock returns faster converge than the bond returns, and show the characteristic of mean regress. So that the most secure longterm investment is stock and isn‚Äôt bond. This didn‚Äôt indicate equities haven‚Äôt risk in long period. In fact, the risk of equities
mainly derived from two aspects: one is system risk, it mainly be determined by investment market economics position, can
be reduced through geographically diverse portfolio of fund investments. Second is non-system risk, source from the risk of
equities production issue by oneself, can be greatly reduced through allocates asset in a variety of sector and in a variety of
investment target. When market volatilities is more acuity, in particular in market depression time, different market
correlation will rise, effects of diversified investments may be weaken.
x Alternative investment
The sovereign wealth fund has allocations to alternative investment. An alternative investment is an investment product
other than traditional investments such as stocks, bonds or cash. This broad definition makes it impossible to list all
alternative strategies, but the most important areas are real estate, private equity, venture capital, commodities, infrastructure
and hedge funds. Alternative investments have high-return and high-risk, are preference mainly because their returns have a
low correlation with those of standard asset classes.
A number of sovereign wealth funds began investing in alternative investment in order to improve the return during 2008.
For example, China Investment Corporation (CIC) made its first investment in a private equity fund in April 2008,
committing $3.2 billion, one of the largest private equity fund commitments of all time, to a buyout fund managed by JC
Flowers & Co. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) is an active investor within the infrastructure asset class. It has up to
4% of its total assets invested in the infrastructure asset class through direct investments, co-investments and listed and
unlisted vehicles. Recently, ADIA has purchased large amounts of residential real estate in Abu Dhabi, New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, London, Paris, Milan and Rome.
3. Optimization model on strategic asset allocation of SWFs
Although some extant literatures[1,2,3,4] have applied the utility function to allocate assets of SWFs, but there are some
deadly limitations in the discussing process. On the one hand, the coarsely classifying the assets of SWFs into risk-free asset
and risk asset maybe make the researching works be far away from effective guidance, on the other hand, the assumption that
the national wealth variable is of linear distribution is not consistent with reality. In this section, we will discuss how to
allocate the asset of SWFs in detail by developing a new bi-objective optimization model to make CRRA utility maximum
and VAR minimum.
Assume the asset of SWFs can be classified into 4 different kinds of asset based on their risk, which can be listed as high
risk asset, moderate risk asset, low risk asset and risk free asset, which can be denoted as x4 (t ) , x3 (t ) , x2 (t ) , x1 (t ) at time t
respectively.
Now assume the risk free x1 (t ) is of following differential distributioQÀñ

dx1 (t )

rx1 (t )dt

(1)
And the risk assets xi (t ) ( i

2,3, 4 ) are of geometric Brown distributions expressed as followingÀñ

dxi (t ) Di (t ) xi (t )dt V i (t ) xi (t )dZ (t )

(2)

Where r denotes risk free interest without considering inflation rate, D i (t ) ( Di (t ) ! r )denotes the different kind of risk
interests of asset xi (t ) respectively, V i (t ) denotes the different kind of risk diffusion coefficients of asset xi (t ) ( i
respectively, and Z (t ) denotes standard Brown motion.

In this paper, a bi-objectives optimization model will be developed to allocate the assets of SWFs based on maximum
CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) utility and minimum VAR (value at risk).Obviously if the gross utility of SWFs can
be summed up by the utility of different kinds of assets with different kinds of risk, it will be convenient to formulate the total
CRRA utility and VAR. Unfortunately the fact that there are must be ubiquitous relationships among different kinds of assets
of SWFs will cause the complexity of asset allocation of SWFs. In order to investigate how to allocate the SWFs, the paper
will discuss the simple case without any relationship among different kinds of investment assets, and the complex case will
be discussed in our subsequent paper.
3.1. CRRA objective function
The CRRA utility function can be represented asÀñ
¬≠ f 1 J (t ) /(1 J ) J  1
(3)
U ( f (t )) ¬Æ
J 1
¬Øln f (t )
Where f (t ) denotes the total accumulation asset of SWFs at time t , which relative risk aversion coefficient is a constant
number, thus U " ( f (t )) / U ' ( f (t )) J .In fact J 0 means that the investment asset is risk free asset. Thus we can also havH
Àñ
(4)
U ( xi (t )) xi1 J (t ) /(1 J )  U " ( xi (t )) / U ' ( xi (t )) J  J  1 , J z 1 , i 2,3, 4 .
Because all the investment assets are assumed to be independence each other, so we can haveÀñ
(5 )
U ( f (t )) U ( x1 (t )) U ( x2 (t )) U ( x3 (t )) U ( x4 (t ))
Let wi (t ) ( i 1, 2,3, 4 ) be the weight number of asset xi (t ) in the total SWFs f (t ) at time t which denotes the
beginning time of investment period 't , which means xi (t ) / f (t ) wi (t ) ( 0 d wi (t ) d 1 ).In order to discuss how to express
the utility function of xi (t ) ( i 2,3, 4 ),a lemma can be narrated as following:
Lemma 1[6,7]: If dx D xdt V xdz , dz

dt , so we can know the increment of ln( x) is of normal distribution at the limited

period t ,its mean value and variance value can be expressed as (D

V 2 )t and V 2 t respectively.

Now we begin to discuss how to formulate the CRRA utility function for each xi (t ) ( i 1, 2,3, 4 ). From (3), we know the
CRRA utility decided by an important factor J .Obviously the higher the risk is, the bigger the risk aversion coefficient J will
be, thus the coefficient J can be classified as four different kinds such as J i corresponding to different asset

xi (t ) ( i =1,2,3,4),and also can be sorted as J 1  J 2  J 3  J 4 .
To x1 (t ) , we can have x1 (t ) x1 exp(rt ) , where x1 denotes the initial asset of x1 (t ) at time t

Though many approaches have been employed to measure the risk, and the most popular technique to control risk is
making variance value of investment minimum, but some risk management researching scholars and practitioners found there
must be some shortfalls in the extant risk management techniques. In this paper, we use VAR (value at risk) technique to
control risk of SWFs. In financial mathematics and financial risk management, Value at Risk (VAR) is a widely used risk
measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a given portfolio, probability and time horizon, VAR
is defined as a threshold value such that the probability that the mark-to-market loss on the portfolio over the given time
horizon exceeds this value (assuming normal markets and no trading in the portfolio) is the given probability level.

Àñ,I/ denotes the loss function, FL (l ) denotes its distribution function. Given some onfidence level

E ¬è (0,1) ,the VAR of the portfolio at the confidence level E is given by the smallest number l such that the probability that
the loss L exceeds l is not larger than 1 E .
VARE

inf{l ¬è R, P( L ! l ) d 1 E } = inf{l ¬è R, FL (l ) t E }

The left equality is a definition of VAR. The right equality assumes an underlying probability distribution, which makes it
true only for parametric VAR.
To risk free asset x1 ('t ) , we can easy to know its VAR is 0 for ever, which means VARE1 =0, where E1 ( 0  E1  1 )
denotes its confidence level.
To risk asset xi ('t ) ( i 1, 2,3, 4 ) of SWFs, let its corresponding confidence level be E i ( 0  Ei  1 ).Obviously if the
VAR of asset xi ('t ) is VAREi , that of asset ln xi ('t ) will be ln(VAREi ) according to the monotonic feature of ln('x) at its
definition area.

4. Algorithm to solve the optimum model

4.1. An simple introduction to NSGA-II
Classical optimization methods, which include multicriterion decision-making methods, suggest converting
multiobjective optimization into a single-objective optimization by focusing on a particular optimal solution at one time.

2438

J. Yu et al. / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 2433‚Äì2440

Adopting such procedure does not only entail repetition of the same process many times to find multiple solutions but also
lacks quality solutions. Therefore, this method has been replaced by many Pareto-optimal solutions as needed. Over the past
decade, a number of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [11] have been suggested to find multiple Paretooptimal solutions in a single simulation run. Since evolutionary algorithms (EAs) work with a population of solutions,
therefore, a simple EA can be used to find true multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run.
Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)[12] is one of the first EAs; however, its approach had the high
computational complexity of nondominated sorting, including lack of elitism and specification of the sharing parameter

V share . An improved version of NSGA named NSGA-II was proposed by Deb

et al.[13] The simulation results of NSGA-II on
a number of difficult test problems outperformed it in terms of finding a diverse set of solutions and in converging near the
true Pareto-optimal set than its two contemporary MOEAs, Pareto-archived evolution strategy(PAES)[14], and strength-Pareto
EA(SPEA)[15]. The application of NSGA-II on four problems from existing literature [16,17] showed improved results when
they were compared with constraint-handling strategy used by Deb et al. The main process of NSGA-‰±∑ includes fast
nodominated sorting approach, diversity preservation (density estimation, crowded-comparison operator) and constraint
handling.
4.2. Numerical Simulation
In model (12), set some coefficients as following, J 1 =0, J 2 =0.25, J 3 =0.5, J 4 =0.75, , E 2 = E 3 = E 4 =0.05, r =0.05, D 2
=0.10, D 3 =0.20, D 4 =0.30, V 2 =0.15, V 3 =0.25, V 4 =0.35, 't =1, 0 d wimin d wi d wimax d 1 .To NSGA-II, some parameters are
set as population size=200,new population size=200,reserve population size=500,mutation probability=0.1,crossover
probability=0.9,max generations=200,then we use C++ to attain 143 Pareto solutions matched with their corresponding
weight numbers, which part listed as following Table 1:

This paper has developed a new investment asset allocation of SWFs which includes CRRA utility based objective and
VAR based objective via dividing the investment asset of SWFs into four kinds of asset according to their different risk, and
the numerical simulation can reflect the essence of the real asset allocation of SWFs.As some idea assumptions must been
made in the above developed model, there are some gap between ideal assumption and practice, so the developed model must
be modified to fit reality.
