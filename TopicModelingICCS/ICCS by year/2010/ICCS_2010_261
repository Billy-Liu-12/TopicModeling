1. Introduction
In this paper we consider the M/D/1/N queue with Poisson arrival process, deterministic service times, ﬁrst-come
ﬁrst-served (FCFS) service discipline, and a capacity of in total N customers (the one in service included). Customers
that do not ﬁnd an empty place at the queue upon their arrival are lost.
Let π∗ denote the stationary distribution of the continuous-time queue-length process of the M/D/1/N queue. It is
well known that π∗ can be expressed via the stationary distribution of the Markov chain embedded at departure points
of customers, denoted by π. Speciﬁcally, let ρ denote the traﬃc rate, then it holds that
π∗ (i) =

numerical approach is to approximate the M/D/1/N queue by the M/D/1/∞ queue, see [10, 9]. However, this approach
is limited to the cases where the traﬃc load is less than one (so that the corresponding M/D/1/∞ model is stable). For
a detailed overview on numerical approaches we refer to the excellent survey in [8].
Note that although obtaining a (simple) closed-form expression for π∗ is a hard problem, using (1) and (2), π∗ can
be numerically evaluated via π, where π can be computed as the solution of πP = π for P being the transition matrix
of the embedded Markov chain.
In this paper, we choose a diﬀerent point of view. We consider π∗ as a mapping of some real-valued parameter
θ, in notation π∗θ . For example, θ may denote the mean service time of the queue. We are interested in obtaining the
functional dependence of π∗ (θ) on θ in a simpliﬁed form. For our approach we will compute π∗θ for some parameter
value θ numerically. However, then we will approximate the function π∗ (θ + Δ) on some Δ-interval. More speciﬁcally,
we will approximate π∗ (θ + Δ) by a polynomial in Δ.
To achieve this we will use the Taylor series expansion approach established in [3]. More speciﬁcally, let πθ
denote the stationary distribution of the queue-length process embedded at departure epoches in the M/D/1/N queue,
where θ ∈ R denotes a control parameter. Under quite general conditions it holds that πθ+Δ can be developed into the
following Taylor series
∞
Δn (n)
πθ+Δ =
π ,
n! θ
n=0
where π(n)
θ denotes the n-th order derivative of πθ with respect to θ. We call
k

Hθ (k, Δ) =
n=0

Δn (n)
π
n! θ

the k-th order Taylor approximation of πθ+Δ at θ, and
Rθ (k, Δ) = πθ+Δ − Hθ (k, Δ)
the k-th order remainder term at θ. Let η denote the half-width of the interval (θ − η, θ + η) on which the stationary
distribution has to be approximated. The Taylor series approximation will only be of practical value if it converges
fast, i.e., if for small k it holds that sup|Δ|≤η |Rθ (k, Δ)| is suﬃciently small.
The current paper will investigate the use of Hθ (k, Δ) for numerical purposes for the M/D/1/N queue. We will
present the algorithm and provide a simpliﬁed representation of the derivatives. In particular, we will identify a recursive form of the derivatives which simpliﬁes coding the algorithm. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of
the new algorithm.
The paper is organized as follows. The embedded Markov chain of the M/D/1/N model is presented in Section 2.
Our series expansions approach is detailed in Section 3. Numerical examples are provided in Section 4.
2. The M/D/1/N Model
Consider the M/D/1 queue with arrival rate λ and deterministic service time θ. Let X(t) denote the number of
customers in the M/D/1/N queue at time t, for t ≥ 0. Note that the queue-length processes {X(t) : t ≥ 0} of the
M/D/1/N system fails to be a Markov process because the service time distribution does not have the memoryless
property. Since we have assumed that customers that do not ﬁnd an empty buﬀer place upon their arrival are lost, the
stationary distribution of {X(t) : t ≥ 0}, denoted by π, exists (independent of the traﬃc rate). Let {Xn : n ∈ N} denote
the queue–length process embedded right after the departure of the nth customer, see [2]. Note that Xn has state-space
{0, . . . , N − 1} as after the departure of a customer the system cannot be full. Then {Xn : n ∈ N} is a Markov chain with

3. The Taylor Series Expansion
For the M/D/1/N queue, Pθ is inﬁnitely often diﬀerentiable with respect to θ. Hence, it holds that the ﬁrst n
derivatives of Pθ exists. Let P(k)
θ denote the kth order derivative of Pθ with respect to θ, then it holds that

the deviation matrix by Dθ deﬁned by

Dθ =

(Pnθ − Πθ ),

where Πθ is a square matrix with rows equal to πθ , with x denoting the transposed of vector x. As shown in [5], for
any ﬁnite-state aperiodic Markov chain the deviation matrix exists. However, the deviation matrix is only known in
explicit form for the M/M/1 and the M/M/1/N queue and we will compute it for our purposes numerically by matrix
inversion using the fact that Dθ = (I − Pθ + Πθ )−1 − Πθ , where I denotes the identity matrix.
The following theorem is an adaptation of Theorem 4 in [3] to the special case of the M/D/1/N queue.
Theorem 1. Let θ ∈ Θ and let Θ0 ⊂ Θ be a closed interval with θ an interior point such that the queue is stable on
Θ0 . Provided that the entries of Pθ are n-times diﬀerentiable with respect to θ, it holds that

The derivatives in Theorem 1 enjoy a recursive structure in the sense that a (k + 1)-st order derivative is mainly
constituted out of information already provided by the k-th order derivative. The following lemma provides the exact
statement.

Theorem 3. Let θ ∈ Θ be an interior point of Θ. Provided that the entries of Pθ are (k + 1)-times continuously
diﬀerentiable with respect to θ on Θ, it holds for Δ > 0 such that θ + Δ ∈ Θ:

where the above equation has to understood element-wise. For Δ > 0, the integration part δk+1 is larger than zero and
it holds for any element i of the vector Rθ (k, Δ)

✷
The Taylor series approximation developed above applies to diﬀerentiable Markov kernels. This extends the case
of linear θ dependence that has been studied in the literature so far; see, for example, [1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 3]. More speciﬁcally,
for linear perturbations the standard assumption is that Pθ , the Markov kernel of the embedded jump chain, is of the
form
ˆ
Pθ = θP + (1 − θ)P,
θ ∈ [0, 1],
(3)
ˆ with Pˆ P, are two Markov kernels.
where P, P,
In contrast to the model in (3), the Taylor series expansions established in this section applies to non-linear perturbations. The case of a non-linear perturbation hasn’t been studied in the literature so far. This case is signiﬁcantly
more diﬃcult than the linear case as in this case all higher-order derivatives of Pθ may be diﬀerent from zero. Moreover, the elements of the Taylor series in the linear case are of rather simple form, which stems from the fact that in
the linear case all but the ﬁrst derivative of P with respect to θ are zero.

4. Numerical Examples
In this section we present numerical examples. We consider as main performance measure the blocking probability
π∗θ (N), which is, due to the fact that customers arrive according to a Poisson arrival stream, equal to the probability
that an arriving customer is lost due to no available free waiting space. The traﬃc rate is given by
ρ(θ) = λθ.
Recall, that by (2), it holds that
π∗θ+Δ (N) =

πθ+Δ (0) + ρ(θ + Δ) − 1
.
πθ+Δ (0) + ρ(θ + Δ)

(4)

Inserting our Taylor series expansion for πθ+Δ (0) into the above expression yields a functional representation of
π∗θ+Δ (N) as a function in Δ. Elaborating on (2), a similar procedure leads to a functional representation of the mean
queue length and via Little’s law to one of the stationary waiting time.

The following numerical examples illustrate our approach. In all numerical examples we have set λ = 1 and
N = 5. We ﬁrst illustrate the numerical behavior of π(n)
θ (i) for 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 and n = 1, 2, 3, for the stationary
distribution of the embedded jump chain of the M/D/1/N queue.
As a ﬁrst example we apply a Taylor series of order 2, i.e,

for each element i = 0, . . . , 4. Note that in this situation the traﬃc load of the system is one but, due to the fact that
we consider a loss system, stability is still guaranteed.

probabilities through the range θ ± 0.2 × θ.
We now turn to the blocking probability. Starting point is the expression for the loss probability in (4). The traﬃc
rate is given by ρ(θ + Δ) = λ(θ + Δ) and πθ+Δ (0) is approximated via a Taylor series polynomial of degree 3, i.e., we
replace πθ+Δ (0) by Hθ (3, Δ)(0).
The approximation in case of saturation, i.e., ρ(θ) = 1, is illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the behavior
of our approximation in the case of over-saturation, i.e., ρ = 1.2. Note that in both ﬁgures we only plot the values
for |Δ| ≤ 0.1 for better readability. As can be seen from the ﬁgures, the approximation yields a satisfying precision
in predicting the loss probability π∗θ+Δ (N). It is worth noting that the quality of the approximation increases with
the traﬃc load. As Figure 4 suggests, for ρ > 1.2 already a Taylor series of order 2 seems to yield a suﬃcient
approximation.
We conclude the discussion of the M/D/1/N queue by providing a bound on the error of the Taylor series approximation for π∗θ+Δ (N). Suppose that for given order k of the Taylor approximation, the error is bounded by R for any Δ
such that |Δ| ≤ δ, i.e., assume that
|πθ+Δ (0) − Hθ (k, Δ)| ≤ R,

see Theorem 3. Replacing πθ+Δ (0) in (2) or (4) by Hθ (k, Δ) and noting that ρ(θ + Δ) = λθ + Δλ, implies thus that the

After some calculations, one arrives at that the following lemma.

Lemma 4. Consider the M/D/1/N queue with arrival rate λ and deterministic service time θ. Suppose that for k it
holds for |Δ| ≤ δ that
|πθ+Δ (0) − Hθ (k, Δ)| ≤ Rθ (k, δ),

We conclude this section with a discussion of the numerical bound on the error provided in Lemma 4. For θ = 1, the
remainder bound is given by
R1 (3, δ) = 4.161 × 10−3
resulting in the error bound for π∗θ+Δ (N)

with 1.280 × 10−3 as true error.
For θ = 1.2 the remainder bound is given by

1.314 × 10−2 ,

R1.2 (3, δ) = 1.215 × 10−3 ,
resulting in the error bound for π∗θ+Δ (N)

As the numerical values indicate, a Taylor series of degree k yields an approximation of the blocking probability
on the interval Δ ∈ [−0.2, 0.2] with an error of no more than 10−4 .
5. Conclusion
We have presented a new approach to the functional approximation of the M/D/1/N queue. As illustrated by the
numerical examples, the convergence rate of the Taylor series is such that already a Taylor polynomial of degree 2 or
3 yields good numerical results. This implies that the proposed Taylor series approximation can be of practical value.
Future research will be on investigating the behavior of the series expansion for multi-server queues. Also a simple
and eﬃciently computable bound on the remainder term of the Taylor series will be a topic of further research.
