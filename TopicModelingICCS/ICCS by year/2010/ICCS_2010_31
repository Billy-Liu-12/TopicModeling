Abstract
The development of the adjoint of the forecast model and of the adjoint of the data assimilation system (adjointDAS) make feasible the evaluation of the derivative-based forecast sensitivity to DAS input parameters in numerical
weather prediction (NWP). The adjoint estimation of the forecast sensitivity to the observation error covariance in
the DAS is considered as a practical approach to provide all-at-once ﬁrst order estimates to the forecast impact as a
result of variations in the speciﬁcation of the observation error statistics and guidance for tuning of error covariance
parameters. The proposed methodology extends the capabilities of the adjoint modeling tools currently in place at
major NWP centers for observation sensitivity and observation impact analysis. Illustrative numerical results are
presented with the ﬁfth-generation NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric DAS and its
adjoint.

1. Introduction
Numerical modeling of the atmospheric dynamics and assimilation of observational data into large-scale atmospheric models are well-recognized as being among the most challenging and computationally intensive problems in
applied sciences. Data assimilation techniques combine information from a model of atmospheric dynamics, observational data, and error statistics to produce an analysis of the state of the atmosphere (Bennett [1], Daley [2], Kalnay
[3], Lewis et al. [4]). In practice, simplifying assumptions are necessary to achieve a feasible implementation and
an increased amount of research in numerical weather prediction (NWP) is dedicated to the development of eﬀective
techniques for diagnosis and tuning of unknown error covariance parameters in both variational and Kalman ﬁlterbased assimilation systems [5], [6], [7], [8]. As the number of observations available has grown almost exponentially
over the recent years, an optimal use of the information provided by the Earth Observing System requires the development of eﬃcient techniques to identify the data components where uncertainties in the observation error statistics
have a potentially large impact in determining the forecast uncertainties.

Valuable insight on the relative importance and contribution of various data assimilation system (DAS) components to reduce the forecast error uncertainties may be obtained by performing sensitivity studies to provide an
assessment of the forecast impact as a result of variations in the DAS input. The development of the adjoint of
the forecast model and of the adjoint of the data assimilation system (adjoint-DAS) allow an all-at-once evaluation
of the derivative-based local sensitivity [9] of a scalar forecast aspect with respect to a large number of DAS input
parameters. Baker and Daley [10] have shown the adjoint-DAS ability to provide observation and background sensitivity for applications to targeted observations. Recently, NWP centers have engaged in the eﬀort of developing the
adjoint-DAS as a tool to monitor the observation impact on reducing short-term forecast errors, to provide data quality
diagnostics, and guidance for optimal satellite channel selection [11], [12], [13], [14].
To date, studies on the forecast impact as a result of variations in the speciﬁcation of the observation error variance
in the DAS have been performed only through additional assimilation experiments (Joiner and Coauthors [15]) and
the increased amount and multitude of data types provided by conventional measurements and by the satellite network
prevents a comprehensive observing system analysis. A study on derivative-based error covariance sensitivity analysis
in variational data assimilation was provided by Daescu [16] using a simple shallow-water model.
The current work presents novel theoretical developments and capabilities of the adjoint-DAS approach that may
be achieved by extending the forecast sensitivity to the space of input error covariances. Section 2 provides a brief
review of the mathematical aspects of sensitivity analysis in variational data assimilation. All-at-once evaluation of
sensitivity to observation error covariance parameters and forecast impact estimation is discussed in section 3. Sensitivity to multiplicative error covariance tuning coeﬃcients is derived as a particular case of the error covariance
perturbation analysis. In section 4, numerical results obtained with the ﬁfth-generation NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) atmospheric DAS and its adjoint developed at NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation
Oﬃce (GMAO) are used to illustrate the practical applicability of the theoretical concepts. Summary and concluding
remarks are in section 5.
2. Sensitivity analysis in VDA
Variational data assimilation (VDA) provides an analysis xa ∈ Rn to the true state xt of the atmosphere by minimizing the cost functional
J(x)

(2)

where xb ∈ Rn is a prior (background) state estimate, y ∈ R p is the vector of observational data, and h is the
observation operator that maps the state into observations. In practice, statistical information on the background error
b
= xb − xt and observational error o = y − h(xt ) is used to specify symmetric and positive deﬁnite weighting
matrices B ∈ Rn×n and R ∈ R p×p that are representations in the DAS of the background and observation error
T
covariances Bt = E( b b ) and Rt = E( o oT ) respectively, where E(·) is the statistical expectation operator. In
operational systems, the dimensionality of the state vector is in the range of n ∼ 107 − 108 and data sets in the
range of p ∼ 106 − 107 are ingested in each data assimilation cycle (typically at a 6 to 12 hour time interval) such
that simplifying assumptions are necessary to achieve a feasible implementation [17]. If the observation operator is
assumed to be linear, h(x) = Hx, the analysis (2) is expressed as
xa = xb + K[y − Hxb ]
where the gain matrix K is deﬁned as
K = B−1 + HT R−1 H

−1

HT R−1

(4)

In four-dimensional VDA the operator h incorporates the nonlinear model to properly account for time-distributed
data and an outer-loop iteration is used to approximate the solution to the nonlinear problem (1)-(2), as discussed in
references [18], [19].

2.1. Error covariance sensitivity analysis
Baker and Daley [10] derived the equations of the sensitivity (gradient) of a scalar forecast aspect e(xa ) to observations and background for a linear analysis scheme (3)-(4):
∇y e(xa ) =
∇xb e(xa ) =

KT ∇x e(xa ) ∈ R p
T

T

(5)
a

[I − H K ]∇x e(x ) ∈ R

n

(6)

Typically, the forecast score is deﬁned as a short-range forecast error measure
e(xa ) = (xaf − xvf )T C(xaf − xvf )

(7)

where xaf = Mt0 →t f (xa ) is the nonlinear model forecast at veriﬁcation time t f , xvf is the verifying analysis at t f which
serves as a proxy to the true state xtf , and C is an appropriate symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrix that deﬁnes the
metric in the state space e.g., the total energy norm. Evaluation of the sensitivities (5-6) is performed by applying the
adjoint-DAS operator KT to the vector ∇x e(xa ) of forecast sensitivity to initial conditions that is obtained using the
adjoint MT of the forecast model along the trajectory initiated from xa :
∇x e(xa ) = 2[Mt0 →t f (xa )]T C(xaf − xvf )

(8)

Additional simplifying assumptions are necessary to alleviate the need for higher order derivative information in the
sensitivity computations when multiple outer loop iterations are used to provide an approximation to the solution to
(1), as explained by Tr´emolet [20].
As shown by Daescu [16], implicit diﬀerentiation applied to the ﬁrst-order optimality condition to (1)
∇x J(xa ; xb , B, y, R) = 0

(9)

allows to establish close relationships between the sensitivities to observations/background and to the associated error
covariances. If {yi }, i ∈ I, denotes a partition of the observational data set y such that for any i1 , i2 ∈ I, i1 i2 the
observational errors in data yi1 are uncorrelated to the observational errors in data yi2 , then the following identities
hold [16]:

Modeling of the observation and background error correlations in the DAS is an area of active research in NWP
[21], [22], [23], [24]. In practice the matrix R is often prescribed as diagonal with entries provided by statistical
information on the observation errors variances, Ri = diag(σ2i ), where σ2i ∈ R pi is the vector of observation errors
variances associated to the data subset yi . In this context the sensitivity to individual observation error variances
σ2i, j , j = 1, 2, . . . , pi is expressed as
a
∂e(xa ) ∂e(xa ) hi (x ) − yi j
=
(12)
∂yi, j
∂σ2i, j
σ2i, j
While the explicit evaluation and storage of the error covariance sensitivity matrices (10)-(11) is not feasible in an
operational system, in particular for the background error covariance sensitivity, their use in an operator format may
be considered and of signiﬁcant importance is the practical ability to provide directional derivatives in the error
covariance space and sensitivities to key parameters used to model the error covariances. For the purpose of this
work, the mathematical formalism to exploit these novel adjoint-DAS capabilities is presented for the observation
error covariance perturbation analysis and parametric sensitivity.

3. Forecast impact of observation error covariance perturbations
The forecast aspect e(xa ) is implicitly a function of the speciﬁcation of the observation error covariances in the
DAS, e(R) = e[xa (R)], and a ﬁrst order approximation to the forecast impact as a result of variations δR in the
observation error covariance may be expressed using the error covariance gradients
δe = e(R + δR) − e(R) ≈
where

∂e

∂R

(13)

X, Y = T r XYT

(14)

denotes the inner product associated to the Frobenius norm on the vector space of matrices of the same order and
is expressed in terms of the matrix trace operator T r. The right side of (13) is the δR-directional derivative in the
observation error covariance space of e evaluated at R. The observation error covariance matrix has a block diagonal
structure associated to data sets with uncorrelated observation errors R = diag(Ri ), i ∈ I, and for practical purposes
the perturbations δR are assumed to be symmetric
δRi = (δRi )T , i ∈ I

(15)

The linear approximation (13) is thus the sum of the ﬁrst order impacts of individual error covariance perturbations
δRi
∂e
δe ≈

Evaluation of the right side terms in (16) is computationally feasible by properly exploiting the outer vector product
structure of the error covariance sensitivities (10) and properties of the matrix trace operator. For example, evaluation
of the ﬁrst order approximation to the impact δei associated to the observation error covariance perturbation δRi
proceeds as follows:
δei

(17)

For column vectors of the same order, the trace operator property T r(abT ) = bT a allows us to express (17) as
a
δei ≈ R−1
i (hi (x ) − yi )

T

δRi ∇yi e(xa )

(18)

which is the equation of the ﬁrst order approximation to the impact δei associated to the observation error covariance
perturbation δRi . From (18) it is noticed that, having available the adjoint-DAS tools developed for observation
sensitivity analysis, the evaluation of the linear approximation to the forecast impact δei requires only the additional
ability to provide the product between the error covariance perturbation matrix and the associated vector of forecast
sensitivity to observations.
3.1. Sensitivity to error covariance parameters
Forecast sensitivity to a parameter si in the observation error covariance representation Ri (si ) is obtained by
relating to a ﬁrst order the error covariance variation δRi to the parameter variation δsi :
δRi ≈

∂Ri (si )
δsi

From (18) and (19) the ﬁrst order approximation to the forecast impact is expressed as
a
δei ≈ R−1
i (si )(hi (x ) − yi )

T

∂Ri (si )
∇yi e(xa ) δsi

∂si

∂Ri (si )
∇yi e(xa )

T

(21)

A particular case of practical signiﬁcance is given by the speciﬁcation
Ri (si ) = si Ri

(22)

that is a common parametric representation used to design and implement error covariance tuning procedures [5], [6],
[7]. From (21) and (22) the sensitivity to multiplicative error covariance coeﬃcients is expressed as
∂e(xa )
1
=
hi (xa ) − yi
∂si
si

T

∇yi e(xa )

(23)

and the parameter value si = 1 corresponds to the observation error covariance speciﬁcation Ri in the DAS. Once
the observation sensitivity ∇yi e(xa ) is available, all-at-once evaluation of the sensitivities to error covariance weight
coeﬃcients for all observing system components is obtained at a modest additional computational eﬀort by taking the
inner product between the observation sensitivity and the associated vector hi (xa ) − yi (analysis-minus-observed).
4. Numerical experiments
The adjoint-DAS capability to provide observation error covariance sensitivity analysis per data type and observing
instrument is illustrated in numerical experiments with the NASA GEOS-5 atmospheric DAS and its adjoint developed
at NASA GMAO. A complete documentation to GEOS-5 DAS is provided in the work of Rienecker and Coauthors
[25]. GEOS-5 DAS assimilates conventional observations such as radiosondes, aircraft, and surface land data, and
radiance observations from the satellite network such as data provided by the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A
(AMSU-A) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites NOAA-15, NOAA-16,
and NOAA-18, High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder-3 (HIRS-3) from NOAA-16 and NOAA-17, and the
Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and AMSU-A on the NASA’s Aqua satellite.
Data assimilation and sensitivity experiments are performed at a horizontal resolution of 2.5◦ × 2◦ with 72 hybrid
levels in the vertical. The model functional aspect (7) is speciﬁed as the 24-hour average global forecast error between
the model vertical grid levels 40 to 72 (from the surface to approximately 128 hPa) in a total (dry) energy norm.
The analysis state xa is obtained by assimilation of data valid at 0000 UTC 28 July 2007 and the verifying state xvf
is provided at 0000 UTC 29 July 2007 by performing 6-hour analysis cycles. The computational overhead in the
evaluation of the forecast sensitivity to observation error variances (12) and multiplicative parameters (23) consists
on the integration of the adjoint of the GEOS-5 general circulation model to obtain the forecast sensitivity to initial
conditions (8), evaluation of the observation sensitivity (5) by applying the adjoint-DAS operator, and followed by
the observation-space product with the vector of analysis-minus-observed. The necessary software tools have been
developed at NASA GMAO and other major NWP centers for observation sensitivity and impact assessment and
the additional capability of performing all-at-once sensitivity to the speciﬁcation of the observation error statistics is
illustrated here.
Comparative maps of observation sensitivity and observation error variance sensitivity are displayed in Fig. 1 for
the 500hPa radiosondes wind data and in Fig. 2 for the NOAA-15 AMSU-A channel 4 and for the NOAA-16 AMSU-A
channel 6 brightness temperature data. The observation sensitivity was initially considered as an observation targeting
tool and provides information necessary to assess the forecast impact as a result of changes in the observing system
components, for a given speciﬁcation of the observation error statistics in the DAS; the error-covariance sensitivity
provides guidance on how uncertainties in the speciﬁcation of the error statistics will impact the forecasts, for a given

conﬁguration of the existing observing system. The combined use of this information is necessary to optimize the use
of data in reducing the forecast errors.
The observation error covariance sensitivity analysis is particularly valuable for satellite data where accurate
estimations of the observational errors (including measurement and representation errors) are diﬃcult to provide,
as compared to conventional measurements. Sensitivity to observation error covariance weighting coeﬃcients (23)
are displayed in Fig. 3 per instrument channel number for NOAA-15 AMSU-A, NOAA-16 AMSU-A, and NOAA-17
HIRS-3 radiance data that was incorporated in the assimilation cycle of interest. Radiance data provided by a subset
of 281 channels of Aqua AIRS was selected for NWP centers [25] and sensitivity results for data from 152 channels
incorporated in the assimilation cycle of interest are provided in Fig. 4. This information may be used to assess the
forecast impact as a result of uncertainties in the speciﬁcation of the error covariances and to provide guidance to
error covariance tuning procedures. Deﬁciencies in the DAS speciﬁcation of the observation error covariances may
be identiﬁed by systematically monitoring the forecast sensitivity to error covariance parameters over an increased
number of analysis cycles to achieve statistical signiﬁcance. Large positive (negative) sensitivity values indicate that
locally the forecast error aspect is an increasing (decreasing) function of the covariance weighting parameter and
outcomes from long-term sensitivity studies may be used to identify the data components where the observation error
covariance is overestimated (underestimated). It is emphasized that in the adjoint approach sensitivity information is
obtained through a single application of the adjoint-DAS operator at a computational cost roughly equivalent to the
cost of performing the analysis and that this information will be diﬃcult to be obtained by other means in VDA. At
the same time, the relevance of the adjoint sensitivity is closely determined by the speciﬁcation of the forecast aspect
of interest.
5. Conclusions and further research
The combined information derived from the adjoint of the forecast model and the adjoint of the data assimilation
system make feasible all-at-once estimation of the forecast sensitivity to DAS input parameters. Observation sensitivity techniques are currently used at NWP centers to monitor the short-range forecast performance of observations and

this study provided the theoretical aspects and a ﬁrst illustration of the adjoint-DAS capability to perform sensitivity
analysis in the space of input error covariances. A systematic monitoring of the forecast sensitivity to DAS error
covariances parameters may be used to identify the observing system components and geographical regions where
improved statistical information would be of most beneﬁt to the analysis and forecasts and to provide guidance to
parameter tuning procedures.
Modeling background error covariances is an area of intensive research in NWP and the adjoint-DAS approach
may be extended to obtain sensitivity information on background error covariance parameters. Proper weighting
between the information content of the prior state estimate and of the observational data is necessary to optimize the
DAS performance and this is an area where further research is much needed.
