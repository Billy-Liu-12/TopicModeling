Abstract
Rapidly growing mobile and online videos have enriched our digital lives. They also create great challenges to our computing
and networking technologies, ranging from video indexing, analysis, retrieval, to synthesis. We found that a significant gap still
remains between low-level features and high-level semantics. The objective of this Workshop is to explore the state-of-the-art of
video analytics and future directions. We intend to bring researchers from a broad range of backgrounds to discover
computational theories and models behind the real-world video applications. We especially want to explore novel approaches
toward semantic video understanding. These invited presentations include video search, video biometrics, video summarization,
video forensics, three-dimensional face recognition, general saccadic motion, and tracking and cropping in video processing. The
