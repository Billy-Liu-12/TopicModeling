Abstract
We report the modelling of cellulose Iα and Iβ crystals and surfaces to reproduce properties of artiﬁcial cellulose coatings. Starting from x-ray structures we optimized the bulk structure using the GLYCAM06 force ﬁeld and
ChemShell in a sequence of short molecular dynamics and geometry optimizations runs. With these bulk structures
we constructed slabs to model the respective surfaces and optimized the surfaces in the same way. Distinctive structural features were found such as the alteration of interlayer distances of the Iβ crystal on the surface and the increase
of the number of hydrogen bonds in the outermost cellulose layer.

1. Introduction
Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and thereby the most abundant organic material on earth. Its
complex structure is still not fully understood. Unravelling the structure and the adsorption and solvation properties
would help to stimulate technological applications, such as new nanostructured functionalized tissue based on cellulose. The development of such materials is the topic of the EU project SURFUNCELL. In this project more than 13
partner groups work on eﬃcient coating of cellulose ﬁlms and modiﬁcation of those via adsorption of e.g. soluble
cellulose derivatives, inorganic nanostructures (nanoplatelets, nanoparticles). From a technological point of view this
functionalization by adsorption is prefered over direct surface modiﬁcation in chemical reactions, but needs detailed
knowledge of the surface structure to optimize the adhesive interactions in the surface-adsorbate interface.
The bulk structure of native cellulose is composed of two diﬀerent polymorphs, the triclinic Iα structure and the
more stable monoclinic Iβ crystallite, as well as amorphous parts [1]. The two polymorphs also diﬀer in the number
of cellobiose units contained in the unit cells. Whereas the Iα [2] phase and the Iβ [3] phase have many times been
the subject of structural studies, the structure of amorphous cellulose still remains unclear. Experimental ﬁndings
identify amorphous parts of cellulose as regions of less density and higher mobility [4]. These regions will be also on
the surface and, thus, accessible to the solvent and to adsorbates. It is expected that thin ﬁlms of cellulose are mainly
amorphous. Mazeau et al. described amorphous cellulose as an ensemble of unperturbed randomly oriented chains
[5]. But due to the technological process of surface grafting, it is most likely an arrangement of small crystallites
connected by less dense, irregular regions with higher hydration.

In this contribution we report ﬁrst steps in modelling complex cellulose surfaces and their adsorption behaviour.
We investigated perfect crystal systems and model surfaces as they are partly found in experimental surfaces. Thereby
the structures are equilibrated and optimized and surface reorganization against vacuum, as well as the software setup
and the applicability of the method are evaluated.
2. Methodology
We use the GLYCAM naming convention for atoms and torsion angles as depicted in Fig.1. The Iα [2] and Iβ
[3] crystal structures were taken out of recent x-ray diﬀraction studies. The supercells were created with the extend
command of ChemShell [6]. They contained 5x5x4 (a=53.5 Å, b=34,6 Å, c=23.8 Å, α=80.4◦ , β=118.1◦ , γ=114.87◦ ),
respectively 2x5x5 (a=16.0 Å, b=42.2 Å, c=53.4 Å, α=β=90◦ , γ=96.6◦ ) unit cells, both with 4200 atoms (Fig.2).
These dimensions were selected so that each cell contained 4 layers. The Iα system can be seen as built up by 4 layers
of tilted cellulose chains, the Iβ, respectively, as built up by layers of planar ones.
All calculations were performed with the ChemShell code [6, 7], which is a shell programm that provides interfaces to a large number of quantum mechanical codes, including TURBOMOLE, NWChem, GAMESS-UK, and
molecular mechanics codes like DL POLY, CHARMM and GROMOS which do the time consuming energy evaluations while ChemShell is concerned with data handling and optimization, but also with molecular dynamics (MD)
[8] using a built-in version of DL POLY [9]. With the interface oﬀered by this program, force ﬁelds like CHARMM,
AMBER and UFF and their derivatives can be used.
We tested diﬀerent force ﬁelds (CHARMM36, CSFF, GLYCAM06) on small carbohydrates and cellulose crystals, and decided to take the AMBER type force ﬁeld GLYCAM06 [10]. Not only did we ﬁnd good agreement of
bonds lenghts, angles and torsional angles of small oligosaccharides compared to DFT, it also exceeded other force
ﬁelds in a recent comparison of carbohydrate force ﬁelds [11]. Furthermore, GLYCAM06 oﬀers convenient usage in
combination with the DL POLY interface and the topology builder tleap, distributed via AmberTools 1.2 [12]. It also
includes parameters for amino groups, carboxy groups, sulfates etc. which will be used in conjunction with adsorption
studies of water soluble cellulose derivatives on these surfaces. For the input generation and visualisation of output
data of ChemShell with VMD 1.8.6 package [13], a few small routines had to be written, e.g. for converting the data
structure of Chemshell optimizations or dynamics trajectories into standard coordinates.
The optimization procedure is based on the sequence used by Mazeau et al. [5]. For the bulk optimization of
the experimental x-ray structure the sequence was: geometry optimization, 20 ps NVT MD at 600 K, geometry
optimization, 40 ps NPT MD at 450 K, geometry optimization, 20 ps NVT MD at 300 K, geometry optimization.
We also investigated the Iα [0,1,0] and the Iβ [1,0,0] surfaces as models for a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic
surface, respectively. These systems seemed to be a good starting point for modelling the surfaces found in conjunction
with artiﬁcial cellulose coatings. The slabs modelling the respective surfaces were built from the optimized bulk

structures. They consist of four layers, the atoms of the bottom layer were kept frozen during the optimization. The
vacuum was simulated by increasing the b parameter for Iα and the a parameter for Iβ by 20 Å. The surfaces were
optimized with the sequence: geometry optimization, 20 ps of NVT MD at 600 K, geometry optimization, 20 ps NVT
MD at 300 K, geometry optimization.
3. Results
During the optimization of both experimental crystal structures (Fig.2) the volume of the elementary cell expanded
by 9%, accompanied by structural changes of the interchain distances. We observe a decrease of the interlayer and an
increase of the interchain distances.
Hydrogen bonding patterns of the investigated structures are in good agreement with similar studies [14] . Intrachain bonds were mainly between OH3 and O5 as well as OH6 and O2 atoms for both species. Hydrogen bonds
between two chains were mainly found between OH3 and O6 and OH2 and O6 atoms. Between two layers strong
hydrogen bonds were found between the OH6 and O4 atoms. An interesting diﬀerence between the two species is
the number of these interlayer bonds, which is about 3 times higher in the Iβ cell than in the Iα allomorph. This is in
agreement with an observed thermal inverconversion between the two species and a postulated higher stability of Iβ
cellulose [15].
Optimization of the slabs yielded the structures in Fig.3 and Fig.4. For the Iα we found the same interlayer
distance with the same number of interlayer hydrogen bonds as in the bulk. The chains on the surface show very
diverse comformations with respect to the torsion angles (χ2, χ3, χ6) of the hydroxy groups. At the surface several
hydroxy groups reorient so that new hydrogen bonds between the layers are formed. On the surface we ﬁnd about
twice as much interlayer hydrogen bonds in the optimized slab (12-14 hydrogen bonds with cutoﬀ 2 Å) compared to
the number in the corresponding layer of the optimized bulk structure (4-6 hydrogen bonds per layer). Due to this
eﬀect the distance between the surface chains is reduced (Fig.3).
In the Iβ slab the interlayer distance is changed signiﬁcantly with respect to the bulk. This was shown by averaging
over 10 equivalent distances between two glycosidic oxygen atoms on top of each other for each layer. We did this
in the bulk structure and the slab. The results are shown in Table 1. Whereas in the bulk structure the average
interlayer distance is constant, considering the deviations, we found an increased distance between the ﬁrst two layers
and contraction in the second and the third layer spacing. The vacuum takes away bonding pressure of the ﬁrst layer
and thereby allows relaxation, whereas the next interlayer distance is contracted. The fact that the third spacing is
again larger allows the assumption that this behaviour will converge towards the bulk interlayer distances within a
few additional layers. However these changes in the distance appear without changing signiﬁcantly the number of
interlayer hydrogen bonds.
In the surface layer, the number of the interchain hydrogen bonds (44 with cutoﬀ 2 Å increased by about 30%
compared to the corresponding layer in the optimized bulk model (34 hydrogen bonds in one layer). This again can
be interpreted as rearrangements of the surface layer to decrease strains and high energy conformations of the bulk
structure exposed to vacuum.

4. Summary and Outlook
The described calculations are in good agreement with similar studies performed in this ﬁeld [14, 16] concerning
the hydrogen bond patterns and crystal structures. Whereas many previous publications report adsorption and solvation of cellulose crystal surfaces, the rearrangement of surfaces solely against vacuum has never been adressed before.
The rearrangements show that this speciﬁc surface of the Iα crystal exposes a large amount of hydroxyl groups in
an irregular fashion and must thereby be more hydrophilic than the chosen Iβ surface, which exposes the hydrogens
bonded directly to the carbon atoms of the glukose ring. These attributes have also been observed in recent wetting
simulations of cellulose surfaces [17].
To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst application of ChemShell in combination with GLYCAM for the simulation on
carbohydrates. The package has a high potential in this ﬁeld, but is also in need of further development to ensure easy
applicability to these systems, especially concerning topology recognition with periodic boundary conditions. In the
further modelling process of this system the next steps will be the transition to less dense amorphous phases, which
hold a strong fraction of the structures observed in cellulose coatings. This could be achieved by stepwise replacing
some cellulose chains with water. A model comprised of small crystallites connected by less dense and less ordered
regions, containing water and, possibly, ions is the aim in this project and could help shed light on the adsorption
processes on these complex composite ﬁlms.
