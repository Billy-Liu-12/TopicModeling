1. Introduction
Investigation of gas ﬂows in micro- and nanochannels is now of practical interest due to development
of miniature devices of various purposes using gas transfer between vessels, transfer of heat by gas, or a
change in the gas mixture composition [1, 2]. These devices are characterized by two geometrical scales,
one of which is deﬁned by the channel length and sizes of vessels connected by the channel and the other
by the channel diameter, with the second scale being much less than the ﬁrst one and commensurate with
the gas molecule free path. The commensurability of the lesser ﬂow scale with molecule free path calls for
application of kinetic theory methods. Due to the large diﬀerence in the scales the ﬂow velocity is usually
much less than the sound velocity, while gas parameters slowly change along the ﬂow. A so-called slow
ﬂow pattern is implemented, where the molecular velocity distribution function is little diﬀerent from the
Maxwellian distribution function almost everywhere. This ﬂow pattern allows optimizing computational
methods as described below.

A reliable basis for studying ﬂows within the framework of the kinetic theory is the Boltzmann kinetic
equation, however, the complexity of its numerical solution has motivated the search for alternative, less
time-consuming, though not rigorously mathematically justiﬁed approaches. One of such approaches is
the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC method) [3] where solution of the kinetic equation is
replaced with computer simulation of movements and collisions of a large number of points representing
gas molecules. This method was successfully used in supersonic aerodynamics, however, its application
for analysis of slightly disturbed ﬂows proved to be extremely ineﬃcient due to non-removable noise [4].
The other commonly used approach is the use of “model” kinetic equations where the complex Boltzmann
collision integral is replaced with a simple relaxation form. Quite a lot of interesting results have been
obtained along this line, but their reliability is not guaranteed since the model equations themselves are not
justiﬁed. From physical standpoint, a serious drawback of the model equations is the velocity-independent
relaxation time, while in real gas the molecular collision frequency changes several times over a substantial
molecular velocity range [5].
For the long time, the major challenge in numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation, besides its
high dimensionality, had been associated with the lack of a conservative method of the collision integral
calculation. This problem has been solved in [6] and then the conservative method of calculating the
collision integral has been essentially improved in [7, 8]. In the work presented herein all calculations were
performed using this method and its generalization for a gas mixture.
2. Mathematical and theoretical framework
2.1. Monocomponent gas
The gas density n(x, t), temperature T (x, t), velocity U(x, t) and other parameters are calculated by
numerical integration on velocity ξ of distribution function f (ξ, x, t) determined from solution of the Boltzmann equation:
∂f /∂t + ξ · ∂f /∂x = I(f, f )
(1)

Equation (1) is solved by the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method on ﬁxed grid in velocity and coordinate space.
The computational domain in the coordinate space is broken down into cells, in the general case having an
arbitrary shape and a ﬁnite volume method is used for approximation of the equation left-hand side. A
spherical domain Ω on a uniform grid with a spacing hv = 2Vmax /N0 , where N0 is the number of nodes for
each velocity coordinate, is chosen as the velocity space. The sphere centre may be displaced relative to
zero depending on the problem. The maximum velocity Vmax is taken equal to 4.8 kTmax /m, where Tmax
is the maximum temperature.
Equation (1) splits into two parts: the transport equation representing the left side and the relaxation
problem. The splitting takes the form Sτ = Aτ /2 Cτ Aτ /2 , where Sτ is the operator transforming the solution
at t0 to the solution at t0 + τ , Aτ is the the operator of solving the transport equation ∂f /∂t + ξ · ∂f /∂x = 0
beginning at steps τ and Cτ is the operator of solving the relaxation problem ∂f /∂t = I(f, f ).
For monatomic gas, the collision integral takes the form [5]:
∞ 2π bm

I(f, f ) =

−∞ 0

0

(f f∗ − f f∗ )gbdbdϕdξ ∗

(2)

By introducing the following notation: φ(ξ γ ) = δ(ξ − ξ γ ) + δ(ξ ∗ − ξ γ ) − δ(ξ − ξ γ ) − δ(ξ ∗ − ξ γ ), where δ is
the Dirac delta function and ξ and ξ ∗ are post collision velocities that are arguments of functions f and
f∗ , we present the collision integral in point ξ γ as follows:
I(ξ γ ) =

In equation (3), integration is performed numerically on the grid ξ αν , ξ βν , bν , ϕν consisting of Nν nodes
in the 8-dimensional domain Ω × Ω × [0, 2π] × [0, bmax ]. Pre-collision velocities ξ αν , ξβν are selected in the
velocity grid nodes. Post-collision velocities ξ αν and ξ βν do not get in the nodes in the general case. For
each velocity ξ αν there is determined a pair of nodes ξ λν and ξ μν that approximates the velocity on the
velocity grid and for velocity ξ βν there are chosen nodes ξ λν +sν and ξ μν −sν that are symmetric about the
total velocity gν = ξ αν + ξ βν , after which the delta function in formula (3) is represented in the following
form: δ(ξ αν −ξ γ ) = (1−rν )δ(ξ λν −ξ γ )+rν δ(ξ μν −ξ γ ), where factor rν is found from the energy conservation
law: (ξ αν )2 + (ξ βν )2 = (1 − rν )(ξ2λν + ξ 2μν ) + rν (ξ 2λν +sν + ξ2μν −sν ). The following power interpolation is used
for approximation of the product of distribution functions after the collision:
fαν fβν = (fλν fμν )1−rν (fλν +sν fμν −sν )rν

(4)

This interpolation provides strict equality of the collision integral of the Maxwellian distribution function
to zero, which is especially important for simulation of slow ﬂows and ﬂows containing slightly disturbed
regions.
Let the solution take the form f = fM + εf (1) where εf (1) is the deviation from the Maxwell distribution
and ε
1. Substituting this solution in the collision integral and considering (4), we arrive at:
I(f, f ) = I(fM , fM ) + 2εI(fM , f (1) ) + ε2 I(f (1) , f (1) )

(5)

Since the principal part of integral I(fM , fM ) is calculated exactly, it follows from (5) that the collision
integral calculation error reduces approximately (2ε)−1 times.
Thus in the projection method only one 8-fold integral (3) is calculated instead of calculating N0 5fold integrals (2), which is more economical. Irrespective of the number of integrating grid nodes, strict
observance of the collision integral conservation laws and its equality to zero on the Maxwellian distribution
function are ensured.
The calculation of collision integral (3) consists of a preparation step that is performed only once and
calculation of collision integrals in each space node and at each time step. At the preparation step, a set of
a large number of 8-dimensional integrating grids ξ αν , ξ βν , bν , ϕν is generated on the basis of Korobov grids
[9]. Korobov grids ensure higher accuracy of multidimensional integral evaluation compared to random
node grids. Post-collision velocities ξ αν and ξ βν , relative velocities gν and factors rν are calculated for
each integrating grid ξ αν , ξ βν , bν , ϕν at a speciﬁed molecular potential. During the calculation, one of such
extended grids is selected in a random manner at each time step and used for calculation of integral (3) in
all nodes of the physical space.
2.2. Gas mixture
Generalization of the conservative projection method of calculating the collision integral for the case of
gas mixture is implemented by going from the velocity space ξi to the molecule momentum space pi = mi ξ i ,
where mi is the molecular mass of the i-th mixture component [10, 11]. The system of kinetic equations for
the N -component gas mixture will take the form:
∂fi

The collision integral for the i-th equation is deﬁned by the following formula:

Operator φi (pγ ) in (7) is similar to the projection operator for a monocomponent gas. The other
calculations are performed similarly to the monocomponent gas case.

2.3. Consideration of rotational degrees of freedom
Consideration of the eﬀect of rotational degrees of freedom may be required for molecular gases since the
characteristic time of rotational relaxation is comparable with the time between molecular collisions. To this
end the generalized Boltzmann equation (Wang Chang-Uhlenbeck equation) can be used [12]. The method
of solving this equation is proposed in [13], however this calls for signiﬁcant computational resources and
we use an approximate approach based on application of the 2LRT model of rotation-translation transitions
[14].
2.4. Organization of calculations
We have developed a problem-solving environment [15] that allows simulating ﬂows in channels of diﬀerent
geometry at speciﬁed physical properties of the gas and gas/surface interaction model. It includes algorithms
of building grids in the coordinate space and in the velocity (momentum) space, algorithms of ﬁnite-diﬀerence
approximation of the advection operator of the kinetic equation of the ﬁrst and second order of accuracy,
parallel computing algorithms built around the domain decomposition technique, data input/output interface
and graphics programs.
The number of computational nodes varied from 107 to 109 , and the size of the Korobov grids laid in
the interval from 5 · 104 up to 106 points depending on the problem. The paralleling algorithm provides
the linear growth of the performance with increasing number of computational nodes [15, 16]. The largest
computational time was for the problem from chapter 3.4, it took 24 hours using 20 dual-core Xeon 5160
3HGz (the simulation was performed with the MIPT-60 supercomputer).

Thermal creep ﬂow develops along a nonuniformly heated surface and is a driving force of thermomolecular Knudsen pumps operating in the rareﬁed gas regime. The simplest Knudsen pump is shown in Figure
1(a). It represents two vessels connected by a narrow channel where a temperature gradient is established.
The ﬂow is considered in plane geometry. Let the wall temperature of the left-hand vessel be T1 and the
wall temperature of the right-hand vessel be T2 = 2T1 . A gas ﬂow to the hot vessel will develop near the
channel walls due to thermal creep, which will cause a reverse ﬂow along the channel center. In steady-state
conditions, these ﬂows equilibrate, which produces vortex ﬂows in the channel and vessels. The ﬂow was
calculated on a rectangular grid with a variable spacing in the physical space. The left-hand side of the
Boltzmann equation was approximated by the explicit TVD scheme of the second order of accuracy.

The ﬂow structure is shown in Figure 1(b) in the form of streamlines taking into account the ﬂow
symmetry. The Knudsen number Kn = λ/h is deﬁned from the molecular mean free path λ in the left-hand
vessel and from the channel width h. The free path at T1 = 300K and atmospheric pressure is λ ≈ 0.1 μm,
which gives h ≈ 1 μm and the maximum dimensional velocity value vmax = 3.5 m/s.

Figure 2: (a) Geometry of a simple multistage Knudsens pump and its wall temperature (b) Distribution of pressure along the
channel axis of the 10-stage pump

Another pump design is shown in plane geometry in Figure 2(a). The pump consists of two channels of
diﬀerent width that produces a gas ﬂow directed from the narrow channel to the wide one. It was precisely
this design that was studied by Knudsen in 1910 [17].
The calculation was performed for the following values of dimensionless parameters: T1 = 1, T2 = 2, H =
2h, L/h = 16/7.
Figure 3 shows steady-state ﬂow ﬁelds for two Knudsen numbers deﬁned from the half-width of the
narrow channel. Figure 2(b) shows steady-state distribution of pressure along the channel axis for a cascade
of 10 pumping units at Kn = 0.5 as shown in Figure 2(a).
3.2. Simulation of a 3D single-stage Knudsen pump
The device represents a long cylindrical tube consisting of a narrow channel with radius r and a wide
channel of radius R > r. Along the wide channel, the temperature increases linearly from T1 to T2 > T1 ,
and along the narrow one the temperature decreases linearly from T2 to T1 . An unstructured tetrahedral
grid is built in the physical space as shown in Figure 4(a).
The grid was built with the GMSH code [18] using the Delaunay triangulation method optimized by
means of the Netgen algorithm.
Let us describe the pumping process for argon at r/λ = 1.25, T2 /T1 = 1.5. The pumping level will
be characterized by the pressure ratio a = p2 /p1 , where p1 is the gas pressure in the vessel being pumped
out and p2 the gas pressure in the vessel being pumped in. The value t0 = kT0 /(mλ2 ) is taken as time
unit. Figure 5(a) shows the level of pumping versus time for the hard spheres potential and Lennard-Jones
potential.
Figure 4(b) shows steady-state pressure distribution produced with the help of the Paraview code [19].
Figure 5(b) presents a plot of gas pumping versus Knudsen number. The most eﬃcient mode of the pump
operation is implemented at λ = r.
3.3. Gas mixture separation in a Knudsen pump
The possibility of separating a gas mixture in a Knudsen pump is studied in plane geometry. The system
geometry is shown in Figure 8(a). There is considered a binary mixture of molecules representing hard
spheres having the same diameter but diﬀerent masses m1 = 10m, m2 = m, which corresponds to the

helium-argon mixture. The initial ratio of gas concentrations was chosen as n1 /n2 = 2/1 and the initial
pressure in the system p = const. The wall temperature of the left-hand and right-hand vessels is maintained
at T1 = T and T2 = 0.5T , respectively and decreases linearly from T1 to T2 along the walls of the slit channel.
Main parameters under observation is the pumping Δp(t)/p and concentrations of the mixture components in the left-hand and right-hand vessels η1 (t) = n1 (t)/(n1 +n2 ) and η2 (t) = n2 (t)/(n1 +n2 ). Respective
curves are shown in Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c). The pressures and concentrations were measured in points A
and B. It should be noted the pumping does not monotonically vary with time. This can be explained by

light molecules fairly quickly transferring to the left-hand vessel thus building up pressure in that vessel,
with heavy molecules leaving the vessel at a much lower rate. The maximum pumping falls on the 15000-th
time step, which corresponds to τ = 100. At the 75000-th step the pumping attains a constant level of 4.8%.
Figures 7(a), 7(b) show the pressure ﬁelds and concentration ratios ﬁelds at the 75000-th time step.
3.4. Shock wave incidence on a periodic slit structure
Incidence of a plane shock wave (SW) on a periodic structure consisting of microslits is considered. The
problem geometry is shown in Figure 8(b), where CDE is the diﬀuse reﬂection slit wall. The length of
segment CD is twice the width of slit h. The wall temperature is equal to the undisturbed gas temperature,
AC and HF are symmetry lines with mirror boundary conditions. The boundary condition set on AH
represents the Maxwellian function with parameters beyond the SW, that on EF – the Maxwellian function
with undisturbed gas parameters and on BG – the initial position of the SW. The initial structure of the
incident wave in the form of molecular velocity distribution function is calculated in advance on the basis
of a one-dimensional SW problem and placed in the computational domain with the center on line BG.
The simulation was performed for the incident wave Mach number M = 3 and several Knudsen numbers
Kn = 2λ/h, where λ is the free path in the undisturbed gas and h is the slit width. Figures 9(a), 9(b)
present results of calculations for the gas of hard spheres molecules at Kn = 0.05 and times 9.6, 138.2,
respectively. Values of main parameters of the gas along the slit center (density, temperature, longitudinal
velocity component and local Mach number) are shown at the top of each ﬁgure. Early in the process,
at t = 9.6, the gas velocity on the ﬂow symmetry line behind the slit entrance is higher than the velocity
beyond the entrance. The SW is slightly ampliﬁed. It is seen from the ﬂow ﬁelds that at that moment the
maximums of the velocity and temperature are at some distance from the symmetry line rather than in the

decelerates and the temperature and velocity maximums move to the central line. Reﬂected SW forming
can be observed to the left of the slit entrance.
4. Conclusion
The examples above show that the developed methodology of solving the Boltzmann equation allows one
to eﬃciently calculate ﬂows of simple gases and gas mixtures in micro- and nanosize channels. It can be
used both for calculation of slow slightly disturbed ﬂows and for simulation of nonsteady supersonic ﬂows
with shock waves.
