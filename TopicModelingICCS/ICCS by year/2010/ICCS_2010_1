Abstract
Ab initio simulations aimed at modelling and interpreting STM induced molecular isomerization of naphthalocyanine molecule are presented. Free energy proﬁle, reaction path and activation energies were obtained using the
metadynamics method in the frame of Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD). We propose a multiscale model
of the molecular switch process, based on the Ehrenfest Molecular Dynamics and on the knowledge of the electronic excited states as computed from ab initio calculations. The time evolution of the electronic density during the
switch process induced by an external bias potential is calculated exploiting the multiscale model. Simulations were
performed on IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer at Moscow State University.

1. Introduction
The investigation of new molecular devices, which can switch between two well deﬁned states is an important
aspect of modern molecular electronics. Single molecules, carrying electric current between a pair of metal electrodes,
could be used as electronic components for logic gates, memory elements, transistors, or switches [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Atomic resolution microscopy techniques, like STM and AFM, are becoming a fundamental tool to unravel the
intrinsic mechanistic issues involved in molecular switch processes [6, 7]. Notwithstanding, it is quite common that
the experimental evidences do require a signiﬁcant theoretical investigation to clarify the details of the switching
process. Therefore, it is not surprising that ab initio simulations are widely used for the understanding of molecular
electronic phenomena [6, 7, 8, 9].
Recently, an experimental evidence has been published [6] on a current-induced hydrogen tautomerization associated with a sensible change in the conductivity of naphthalocyanine molecules absorbed on an ultrathin insulating
ﬁlm. Applying an external bias voltage between the tip of the STM and the molecule, a hydrogen tautomerization reaction can be induced by the tunneling electrons in the scanning tunneling microscope junction. The bistability in the
position of two hydrogen atoms in the inner cavity of single free-base naphthalocyanine molecule shows a two-level

system, that can be manipulated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Because the switching is well-deﬁned,
highly localized, reversible, intrinsic to the molecule and is not associated with any change in the molecular framework, this class of molecules has attracted lots of attention as possible building blocks for more complex molecular
devices.
Although a preliminary justiﬁcation has been provided based on the mere analysis of molecular orbitals, there are
still many questions opened and addressable by computational investigations: what is the barrier associated with the
switching process? Is the reaction involving a single or multiple electronic states?
In this paper, we present ab initio simulations of the switching process of naphthalocyanine molecules [6], based
on Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) [10], as implemented in the CPMD code [11, 12].
Reaction paths, transition states and free energy barrier heights involved in the isomerization process were investigated by performing metadynamics simulations [13, 14]. Calculations were run on the IBM Blue Gene/P at Moscow
State University, and each run required roughly 20 hours of elapsed time on 1 rack. Based on the electronic states
computed within the ab initio framework a multiscale model is proposed for describing the dynamical aspects of the
switching process.
2. Basic equations
In this section we review the basic equations behind density functional theory and Car-Parrinello method [10].
Within DFT and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the movement of massive nuclei is described with a classical
approximation. Forces acting on nuclei, due to the interactions with the electrons are calculated solving the KohnSham equation for ground state [15].
An elegant approach to propagate simultaneously electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom was presented in
1985 by Car and Parrinello [10]. The equations of motion derived from the extended Car-Parrinello Lagrangian can
be summarized for nuclei and electrons as:
¨ I (t) = − ∂ E KS [{ψi }, {RI }],
MI R
∂RI
δ
E KS [{ψi }, {RI }] +
Λi j ψ j
(1)
μi ψ¨i (t) = −
δψi
j
where MI and RI are mass and coordinate of nucleus I, μ is the ﬁctitious electron mass, ψi are the Kohn-Sham orbitals
and E KS is the Kohn-Sham energy. Last term in equation (1) is holonomic constraints, which takes in account the
requirement of the orthogonality of orbitals. This leads to the need to calculate the forces acting on the ions − ∂R∂ I E KS
at each simulation step, on orbitals − δψδ E KS , and to the evaluation of the Lagrange multipliers Λi j .
i
In standard DFT theory, the Kohn-Sham energy is deﬁned as:

where Uext is the ionic potential and
ρ(r) =

fi |ψi (r)|2

is electronic density, fi are the occupation numbers, E XC is the exchange-correlation energy and E I the ion-ion electrostatic interaction.
The CPMD works entirely in plane waves (PW) as basis set for expanding the valence molecular orbitals and
pseudopotential to describe the core electrons. Within the PW formalism the wave function vectors ψi (Kohn-Sham
orbitals) can be written as:
1
ci (G)eiGr ,
ψi (r) = √
Ω G
where Ω is cell volume, G is the reciprocal lattice vector and ci (G) are the Fourier-coeﬃcients of orbital i.

3. Ab initio calculation of free energy surface proﬁle using metadynamics method.
One of the most used way to characterize reaction paths is the intrinsic reaction coordinate [16]. This is deﬁned
as the steepest descent path on the potential energy surface in mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates, that connects the
(chemical) reactant state with the product state. When working at ﬁnite temperature, the intrinsic reaction coordinate
is not any longer eﬀective since the entropic factor inﬂuences the minimum free energy path.
To explore free energy paths, we employed the metadynamics [13, 14], which is a wide spread methodology,
applied in many diﬀerent contests [17, 18], that allows an eﬃcient exploration of free energy proﬁles, along a deﬁned
set of collective variables.
For studying the reaction of hydrogen isomerization taking place in naphthalocyanine molecule, we employed
two collective variables based on the coordination number of the nitrogen atoms of the internal cavity with the two
hydrogens (see ﬁg. 1a). The two collective variables share the same analytical form, which for s1 can be expressed
as:
⎫

R0

where RHi N j are distances between “i”-th hydrogen atom and “j”-th nitrogen atom, R0 is the equilibrium distance
between hydrogen atom and nitrogen atom, equals to 1.05 Å.
The usage of the above collective variable would require a bidimensional exploration of the free energy, since
we would require two coordination variables: one for N1 − N2 (s1 (H1 , H2 , N1 , N2 )) and the second one for N3 −
N4 (s1 (H1 , H2 , N3 , N4 )). The dimensionality can be eﬀectively reduced considering instead the following collective
variable:
s = s1 (H1 , H2 , N1 , N2 ) − s1 (H1 , H2 , N3 , N4 )
Metadynamics allows us to explore free energy basins through the use of an history dependent term which disfavors the system from visiting the same places already visited during the molecular dynamics. The artiﬁcial historydependent biasing potential V(s, t) is added to the system along molecular dynamics:
V(s, t) = −

ti <t

H · exp[−

(s(t) − s(ti ))2
]
2W 2

This biasing potential is a sum of repulsive Gaussian-shaped potential hills, each with height H. Potential hills are
added to the history-dependent potential, V(s, t) with a certain time interval (τ MT D ), one or two orders of magnitude
larger than the MD step (τ MD ). The potential discourages the system to revisit points in conﬁgurational space which
correspond to the reactant state basin, allowing the system to escape via the lowest transition state to the next local
(product) minimum. When all the local free energy minima are “ﬁlled up” with hills, the system can move freely from
the reactant state to the product states, in a diﬀusive way. As a result, the free energy proﬁle F(s) can be obtained as
the negative of potential V(s, t).
The geometry of the naphthalocyanine molecules were ﬁrst optimized [19] and subsequently thermalized at a
working temperature of 30K, employing an NVT ensemble, based on the Nose-Hoover thermostat [20]. The optimized
geometry of the two naphthalocyanine molecules (two stable isomers) have been show in ﬁg. 1a and in ﬁg. 1b.
Calculated proﬁle of the free energy surface along the symmetrized coordination variable is shown in ﬁg. 2.
In ﬁg. 2, we can identify the two equilibrium states corresponding to the values of coordination variable s = 0.6
and s = −0.6. The value s = 0.0 relates to a stable intermediate state consisting of the two hydrogens in nearby
positions (N1 − N3 or N1 − N4 , like N2 − N3 , N2 − N4 ). Particular care has been used to test the convergence of the
metadynamics procedure, achieved by a special choice of the set of metadynamics parameters. Overall we have been
testing and we reported in ﬁg. 2 four sequential metadynamics runs with diﬀerent parameters set.
In metadynamics calculations the Gaussian width/height doesn’t change, and the run are stopped as soon as the
system reaches diﬀusivity in the space of the collective variables. The ﬁrst run was with Gaussian with height H =
3kB T and width Δs = 0.03. The second metadynamics is characterized by H = 1.5kB T , which is half the value
of the ﬁrst run setup. The third and fourth runs have been done employing Gaussian heights of H = 0.75kB T and

Figure 2: Calculated free energy proﬁle along coordination variable “s”. Convergence was achieved with four sequential calculations with diﬀerent
parameters: 1)H = 3kB T ; Δs = 0.03 2) H = 1.5kB T ;3) H = 0.75kB T ;4) H = 0.375kB T

H = 0.375kB T , respectively. In all runs the timestep used to spawn the hills of the history dependent term was of 800
MD timesteps, with a value of the MD timestep of 0.1125 fs.
From ﬁg. 2 we can clearly identify two main basins, which represent the two states of the molecular switching
process and an intermediate state. The barrier separating the two states is well converged to a value of 52 kJ/mol with
accuracy of 1kJ/mol.
4. Reduced model for switching based on excited molecular states.
The eﬀect of the barrier height on the hysomerization kinetic in the presence of an external electric ﬁeld is analyzed
through the usage of a reduced multiscale model for the switching process.
The idea of a multiscale model relies on the fact that the most CPU intensive part of the calculation is obtaining
the FES and barrier height of reaction. This part clearly requires the knowledge of an ab-initio free energy surface
and can be eﬀectively obtained using the CPMD code.
In ﬁg. 1 c,d, we depict few most important excited Kohn-Sham orbitals: LUMO (c) and LUMO+1 (d). The
structures of these unoccupied molecular orbitals are connected with a 90 degrees rotation along the perpendicular
axis of the molecule. The switching process can be explained by the following simple scheme: the STM bias voltage
leads current to ﬂow through the molecule and in ﬁrst approximation causes the excitation of the electrons in LUMO
and LUMO+1 orbitals.
As we can calculate electronic Kohn-Sham orbitals we can build a reduced model on the base of Ehrenfest molecular dynamics and time dependent DFT[21]. The goal is to obtain the electronic density perturbation due to the external
electric potential and the correspondent forces on hydrogen nucleus in the central cavity of the molecule.
We expand the electronic wave functions using the full set of Kohn-Sham orbitals to get the solution of timedependent Schroedinger equation:
cm (t)ψm (r, R),

Ψ(r, R, t) =
m

where r and R are electronic and ionic positions. Let ψm (r, R) satisﬁes the stationary equation:
ˆ m (r, R) = Em ψm (r, R)
Hψ
According Ehrenfest molecular dynamics, the time dependence of the coeﬃcients cm (t), represents the evolution of
the system in time. Now let us suppose that Hamiltonian has the form:
Hˆ = Hˆ 0 + Vˆ eH + Vˆ ext

where Vˆ eH is the potential of the electrostatic interaction between electrons and two hydrogen nuclei in the central
cavity of the molecule, Hˆ 0 is the whole molecule Hamiltonian with extracted Vˆ eH , and Vˆ ext is the external potential.
We introduce an approximation of the unperturbed molecule potential surface as
U F = −bρeq ; U F (s) = −α

where ρeq is “equilibrium” electronic density of total molecule.
Consider now the motion of two hydrogens on the equilibrium FES (described by one coordination variable)
excited by electronic density perturbation due to external potential. We introduce ﬁctitious particle which shows two
hydrogens position as s(t) and obtain approximate equations of motion:

|Ψ(r, t)|2 gives us the the probability of ﬁnal state.
Let us consider the HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals, included in wave function expansion. The structure
of LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals are shown in ﬁg. 1c,d.
We choose external potential in the following form:
V ext = V0 · (z − z0 ) · cos(ωt).
Solution of the system (2) and (3) is shown in ﬁg. 3a,b for diﬀerent values of the external electric potential. In
particular we observe that a value of V0 =0.2eV is not enough for having the switching between the two minima of the
free energy. The minimum value required to observe switching is for an external potential of V0 = 0.5eV.
We can observe switching frequency using diﬀerent amplitude and frequency of external potential, because process
can be viewed as switch due to their spatial structure. It is important to notice that switching can observed only if there
is resonance between potential and frequency of transition between orbitals, and separation is provided by amplitude
V0 of a signal. Critical value of the bias potential needed to observe switching well agreed with barrier height found
by metadynamics method.
5. Conclusions.
Ab initio simulations of molecular switch on the base of STM induced isomerization of naphthalocyanine molecule
is presented. Free energy proﬁle and reaction path is analyzed using CPMD code. Barrier height for reaction along
coordination variable is found to be 52 kJ/mol. We have shown that the dynamics of all molecular nuclei (vibrational
and rotational modes) is very important in ﬁnding of reaction path.
On the base of ab initio CPMD calculations we proposed a reduced Ehrenfest model, which permits to analyze
self-consistent evolution of excited electronic states and hydrogen nuclei dynamics in the central cavity of molecule.
It is obtained that the value of bias potential in reduced model needed for switching is in a good agreement with the
barrier height of free energy found in metadynamics.
