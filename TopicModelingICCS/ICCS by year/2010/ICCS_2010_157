Abstract
We present a Singular Function Boundary Integral Method (SFBIM) for solving elliptic problems with a boundary singularity. In
this method the solution is approximated by the leading terms of the asymptotic solution expansion, which exists near the
singular point and is known for many benchmark problems. The unknowns to be calculated are the singular coefficients, i.e. the
coefficients in the asymptotic expansion, also called (generalized) stress intensity factors. The discretized Galerkin equations are
reduced to boundary integrals by means of Green’s theorem and the Dirichlet boundary conditions are weakly enforced by means
of Lagrange multipliers, the values of which are introduced as additional unknowns in the resulting linear system. The method is
described for two–dimensional Laplacian problems for which the analysis establishes exponential rates of convergence as the
number of terms in the asymptotic expansion is increased. We also discuss the extension of the method to three–dimensional
Laplacian problems with exhibits edge singularities.

1. Introduction
In the past few decades several methods for treating elliptic boundary value problems with boundary
singularities, have been proposed. Among them one finds the so-called hybrid methods [1] which incorporate,
directly or indirectly, the form of the local asymptotic expansion for the solution u, in the approximation scheme.
This expansion is known in many occasions and has the following form:

are the singular functions, with ȝj, fj being the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the problem which are uniquely
determined by the geometry and the boundary conditions along the boundaries sharing the singularity. It is
important to note that the singular functions Wj satisfy the governing partial differential equation (PDE) and the
boundary conditions (BCs) along the boundary parts sharing the singularity.
Knowledge of the singular coefficients is of great importance in many engineering fields, such as fracture
mechanics. Many methods have been proposed in the literature for their effective and efficient approximation,
including high order p/hp finite element methods with post-processing [2, 3] and Trefftz methods [1]. In the former,
the solution is first approximated on a refined grid designed especially to capture the singularity and the coefficients
are obtained by an extraction formula which uses the computed solution. Methods that do not require any postprocessing and/or include information about the exact solution in the approximation scheme, such as Trefftz
methods, are more attractive if the approximation of the coefficients is the main objective. The SFBIM, which was
developed by Georgiou and co-workers [4] for Laplacian problems with a boundary singularity, also has this trait.
In the SFBIM the solution is approximated by the leading terms of the expansion (1), i.e.
N

where D Nj are the approximate singular coefficients. The method has been successfully applied to a number of
benchmark problems [5, 6]. In [7] it was shown theoretically that its convergence rate is exponential as N o f.
The method has also been extended to biharmonic problems in two-dimensions arising from solid and fluid
mechanics [8, 9]. The main advantages of the SFBIM are:
x The dimension of the problem is reduced by one, leading to considerable computational savings
x The singular coefficients are calculated directly, hence avoiding the need for post-processing
In this work we present the method and its properties for a model two–dimensional Laplacian problem with a
boundary singularity, including numerical experiments for illustration purposes. We then discuss its extensions to
three-dimensional Laplacian problems with an edge singularity.

2. The SFBIM

For concreteness, we consider the following Laplacian problem (see also Figure 1 below): Find u such that

It is assumed that the data of the problem, f and g, are smooth and such that no other singularities arise. Now, by
applying Galerkin’s principle we have

Solving the system given by eq. (8) will produce the approximate singular coefficients as well as the discrete
Lagrange multipliers. We emphasize that all integrals appearing above are one dimensional (thus the dimension of
the problem is reduced by one) and are carried out on portions of the domain away from the singularity; therefore
they can be evaluated by standard techniques, such as Gaussian quadrature. We should also mention that in the
above system, the coefficient matrix K becomes singular when M > N, so the number of (discrete) Lagrange
multipliers has to be smaller than the number of singular functions.

2.2. Error Analysis
The SFBIM has been analyzed in the context of Laplacian problems and in this subsection we summarize the
main results from [7]. Let H k (:) denote the usual Sobolev space of functions on ȍ whose (generalized) partial
derivatives of order 0, 1, …, k are square integrable, and let || · ||k,ȍ denote the associated norms. We then define

^

`

H *1 { w  H 1  :  : w | S2 0 , H 1/ 2 (w:) { ^w  H 1  :  : w | w: H 0 (w:)` ,
and H –1/ 2 (w:) as the closure of H 0 (w:) with respect to the norm

In figure 3 we show the percentage relative error in the solution u versus N, in a semi-log scale, for different
values of the polynomial degree p used to approximate the Lagrange multipliers. We see that, independently of p,
the method converges at an exponential rate, as predicted by equation (13).

In figure 4 we show the percentage relative error in the first four singular coefficients versus N, in a semi-log
scale, for the case when p = 1 (other values of p gave similar results). The exponential convergence, as predicted by
equation (14), is again clearly visible.

Finally, in figure 5 we show the error in wu / wn versus M, in a log-log scale, when wu / wn on the curved side of
our domain is discretized by piece-wise polynomials of (fixed) degree p on a mesh with width h, i.e. M ~ p/h. The
error estimate (13) states that the convergence rate is algebraic of order p, and indeed this is what figure 5 shows.

4. Extension to three-dimensions

our knowledge, still possesses several important open questions. In particular we consider the following: Find u

A singularity will arise along the edge AB, and we assume that the given data is smooth enough such that no
other singularities are present. The difference between two and three-dimensions is substantial, since now the local
solution is given by

coordinate x3; for this reason they are called Edge Stress Intensity Functions (ESIFs) [10, 11]. Nevertheless, they
are known to be smooth functions [11], hence they can be approximated by polynomials, of say degree N, as

We note that the infinite sum in (22) will terminate after a finite number of terms, since D Nj  x3  is a polynomial.
Consequently, the number of unknowns in the above expression is N u (N + 1). To determine them we weigh the
