Abstract
Recently, the authors introduced a comprehensive framework to use a custom-tailored Langevin equation with
correlated-noise in the context of molecular-dynamics simulations. Here it is established how such a framework
can be used to selectively excite normal modes whose frequency falls within a prescribed, narrow range. Possible
application of this technique to the diagonalization of large matrices is also discussed.

1. Introduction
Stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDE) have been used to model the time evolution of processes characterized by
random behavior, in ﬁelds as diverse as physics, chemistry and economics. In particular, in physics and chemistry the
Langevin equation (LE) has been regularly applied in the study of Brownian motion, and has been used extensively in
molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations as an eﬃcient tool to obtain trajectories which sample the constanttemperature, canonical ensemble[1, 2].
In its original form, Langevin equation is based on the assumption of instantaneous system-bath interactions,
which correspond to the values of the random force being uncorrelated at diﬀerent times. A non-Markovian, generalized version of the LE arises in the context of Mori-Zwanzig theory[3, 4], where the process of integrating out some
degrees of freedom leads to a stochastic equation where both the friction and the noise are correlated in time. The
conventional LE is recovered in the limit of a clear separation between the characteristic time-scale of the system’s
dynamics and that of the system-bath interaction.
This class of non-Markovian SDEs has been extensively used to model the dynamics of open systems interacting with a physically-relevant bath (see e.g. Refs. [5–7]). Instead, we have recently used correlated(colored)-noise
SDEs as a device to sample eﬃciently statistical distributions in molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations.[8–10] These
papers show how to construct stochastic thermostats to sample eﬃciently the canonical ensemble in standard and
Car-Parrinello-like molecular dynamics[8]. This has been made possible by mapping the non-Markovian process of

interest into a Markovian one in an enlarged space, in which the physical variables are supplemented by a number of
additional degrees of freedom.[10, 11]
We also proved that, by relaxing the requirement that the Generalized Langevin equation (GLE) fulﬁlls classical
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), a frequency-dependent thermalization can be achieved, where quasi-harmonic
modes of diﬀerent frequencies are given a diﬀerent eﬀective temperature. By tuning the shape of the ﬂuctuationsversus-frequency curve, one can enforce a probability distribution consistent with that of a quantum harmonic oscillator. The properties of the GLE are such that the dynamics automatically feels the presence of normal modes
of diﬀerent frequencies, and enforces the appropriate probability distribution, without having to know the frequency
spectrum beforehand. We demonstrated that by this technique nuclear quantum eﬀects can be modeled accurately in
a large class of problems at a fraction of the cost of path-integrals calculations.[9]
In this paper we further exploit the ﬂexibility of this approach, by constructing a δ-thermostat, that is a GLE
which selectively excites the vibrational modes close to a given frequency, and keeps all the others cold. Such a
thermostat can be useful in a number of applications. It can be thought as a model to simulate heating by an intense,
monochromatic source, or as a tool to induce transitions which depend on a single vibrational mode. We will describe
the eﬀects of this δ-thermostat in the case of molecular-dynamics simulations of ice Ih. Finally, we will shortly
describe how the same kind of GLE can be used as an eﬀective method to probe the eigenvalue spectrum of a large,
positive-deﬁnite matrix, avoiding explicit diagonalization.
2. A generalized Langevin equation thermostat
The framework we have used to deﬁne an appropriate generalized Langevin equation thermostat, to analyze its
properties and to ﬁt it to the problem of interest has been described in detail in a recent publication[10]. Here, we will
only brieﬂy introduce our notation and summarize the main ideas.
A general, non-Markovian Langevin equation for a particle with position q and momentum p, moving under the
inﬂuence of a potential V(q) can be written as
q˙ = p
p˙ = −

∂V
−
∂q

K(t − s)p(s)ds + ζ(t).

Here K(t) is the memory kernel describing the friction, and ζ(t) is a source of Gaussian random numbers characterized
by the correlation function H(t) = ζ(t)ζ(0) . Note that we will use mass-scaled coordinates and set the Boltzmann
constant kB = 1 throughout this paper.
Such a stochastic diﬀerential equation is hard to treat analytically or to integrate on a computer. Algorithms exist to
generate a sequence of random numbers with prescribed time correlation eﬃciently[12, 13], but in order to introduce
an history-dependent friction kernel K (t) in a straightforward manner, one would have to store the past trajectory
of the momenta, leading to a procedure which would be ineﬃcient from a computer time and memory requirements
points of view.
To circumvent this diﬃculty, we use a Markovian, linear SDE in an extended phase space, where the physical
variables are supplemented by a set of additional momenta, s.[14] The resulting equations read

Where ξ is a vector of uncorrelated Gaussian random numbers, which satisfy ξi = 0 and ξi (t)ξ j (t ) = δ(t − t )δi j .
As in Refs. [9, 10], where the details of the naming convention are given, we deﬁne the submatrices a p , a¯ p , b p , b¯ p ,
which deﬁne the coupling between the p and s variables. a pp and b pp act on p only, while A and B couple the s’s
among themselves. The combination of those matrices deﬁnes the matrices A p and B p .
By means of a SDE of the form (2) one can represent in a simple, Markovian formalism a large class of nonMarkovian Langevin equations. In fact, one can show that by integrating away the s degrees of freedom in Eqs. (2) a

non-Markovian equation for the trajectory of the physical variables (q, p) is obtained. Its form corresponds to Eqs. (1)
with kernels

where we deﬁned the matrices D p = B p BTp and Z = 0 dte−At De−A t . Memory kernels which can’t be written exactly
in the form (3) can still be represented approximately, provided that a suﬃciently large number of additional degrees
of freedom is used.
By varying the elements of A p and B p , one can change the memory functions of the GLE, and therefore the static
and dynamical properties of the molecular dynamics trajectory. In the case of a harmonic system, the overall SDE can
be solved exactly, and the results in the harmonic limit are then used to ﬁt A p and B p to the desired properties.
3. Selective normal-modes excitation
It is not diﬃcult to construct a GLE thermostat whose memory kernels’ Fourier transform has a Dirac-δ-like shape.
In fact, let us consider the SDE which derives from the choice of parameters

D p =T A p + ATp .

(5)

Such matrices generate a valid dynamics for any positive choice of γ, Δω, T . The Fourier transform of the corresponding memory kernels reads:
K(ω) =2γ

Δω2 + ω20 + ω2 1
Δω
(ω + ω0 )2 + Δω2 π (ω − ω0 )2 + Δω2

H(ω) =T K(ω).

(6)
(7)

For small Δω, K(ω) and H(ω) have a δ(ω − ω0 )-like shape. Eqs. (5) and (7) express the classical FDT: if they are
satisﬁed, the dynamics generated by Eqs. (2) will sample the canonical ensemble at temperature T . We note in passing
that – together with the combination rules to be discussed in Appendix A – a collection of δ-like kernels centered on
diﬀerent frequencies provides the building blocks to construct a SDE with arbitrary memory functions.
The simplicity with which δ-function-like memory kernels of the form (6) can be obtained hints at a possible
application for colored-noise thermostatting. Namely, one can try to generate a SDE which, once applied to an
assembly of harmonic oscillators, will induce large ﬂuctuations for the modes whose frequency falls within a narrow
range, and ensures that all the others will remain cold. Intuitively, a memory kernel of the form (6) will perturb more
the normal modes which have a frequency close to ω0 . Then, if one imposes a constant friction on top of the matrices
in Eq. 4 (i.e. by changing the a pp element from zero to a ﬁnite value γ , without changing D p ) one can expect modes
far away from the peak frequency to be aﬀected by the uniform friction, and to freeze almost completely. Modes close
to ω0 , instead, would equilibrate at a much larger average temperature. Note that changing A p without performing the
changes to D p prescribed by Eq. (5) amounts at breaking the classical FDT.
For a given peak frequency ω0 one is left with four parameters to optimize (Δω, γ, γ , T ), so as to obtain the
most convenient response properties. Based on the same scheme described in Refs. [8–10], one can compute the
correlation properties for an harmonic oscillator of frequency ω. For instance, one can compute the ﬂuctuations of
momenta, p2 (ω), which with our choice of units correspond to an ω-dependent eﬀective temperature T (ω).
Even with such a relatively simple model, satisfactory results can be achieved, with ﬂuctuations of positions and
momenta which correspond to a desired eﬀective temperature T 0 in a neighborhood of ω0 , and drop quickly to a very
low value elsewhere. However, the dependency of the temperature proﬁle T (ω) from the memory kernels is not a

trivial one. For example, it is not suﬃcient to reduce Δω to obtain a sharper peak in the normal-modes response. For
this reason we resorted to a ﬁtting procedure analogous to the one described in Ref. [10], which has allowed us to
obtain a sharp T (ω) proﬁle, while at the same time we could achieve a low correlation time

ensuring that thermalization and sampling are eﬃcient. The outcome of the ﬁt is a set of parameters we report in
Appendix B. The properties of the trajectories produced by such parameters are described in Figure 1.
Just by scaling the drift and diﬀusion matrix, the parameters depicted in Figure 1 can be adapted to any peak
frequency ω0 and eﬀective temperature T 0 , and will be hence used in all the applications described below. In fact,
given a set of GLE matrices A p and D p , which gives an eﬀective temperature versus frequency curve T (ω), peaked
around ω0 = 1, one can prove that the same D p matrix and the scaled drift matrix ω0 A p will produce the response
curve
(9)
T ω0 (ω) = T (ω/ω0 )/ω0
which is peaked around ω0 and has the same peak integral regardless of ω0 .
4. Selective phonon heating in ice Ih
As a ﬁrst example, we describe the eﬀects of this δ-thermostat on the molecular dynamics of a solid; namely,
we performed simulations using a ﬂexible water force ﬁeld[15], and run several trajectories scaling the parameters to
diﬀerent peak frequency. Here, we have scaled the matrices so as to obtain a constant peak temperature T 0 = 10 K,
which is low enough to reduce the eﬀects of anharmonicities. In Figure 2 we report the vibrational density of states
computed from the Fourier transform of the velocity-velocity correlation function in the diﬀerent trajectories, and we
compare it with the vibrational spectrum computed from constant-energy dynamics out of a sample equilibrated at
10 K.
Clearly, the δ-thermostat succeeds in selectively exciting a narrow band of normal modes; interestingly, even at this
low temperature, anharmonic eﬀects cause slight deviations from the expected behavior. In particular, an excitation is
observed also when the peak frequency falls within a vibrational gap of the intrinsic phonon density of states of the
ice model. However, such excitation is a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than the ones observed when proper
normal modes are present.

Figure 2: The vibrational density of states for ice Ih at 10 K (thick line, fully-shaded in red), as computed from the Fourier transform of the
velocity-velocity correlation function from a molecular-dynamics simulation of a ﬂexible-water model[15], is confronted with a stacked plot of a
series of δ-thermostat runs, with a diﬀerent peak excitation frequency ω0 .

It is interesting to note that in the past a method was attempted to obtain selective heating of normal modes, based
on a pair of sudden quenches of the system’s velocities with a ﬁxed delay[16]. Such “quench echoes” can be thought
as an indirect way of inducing a time-correlated perturbation in the dynamics, and it would be intriguing to explore
further the analogies between the two approaches.
5. δ-thermostat dynamics as an eigenvalue solver
The possibility of exciting normal modes within a narrow frequency band, without the need of an explicit knowledge of the vibrational spectrum of the system, suggests that the δ-thermostat can be used to probe the spectrum of a
positive-deﬁnite matrix H of size N, by using the latter as the Hessian of a multi-dimensional harmonic potential, on
which the dynamics is to be performed. Our method would be particularly useful whenever matrix-vector multiplications are considerably less expensive than explicit diagonalization. This is the case for instance when the matrix is
sparse, or when it has a favorable structure[17].
To this aim, we implement an artiﬁcial dynamics, using H as the Hessian of a multidimensional, harmonic potential, V(x) = 12 xT Hx, and the GLE parameters reported in Appendix B. Contrary to the case of ice, no anharmonicities
are present here, and the equilibrium distribution will be the one predicted analytically, but for negligible ﬁnitetimestep errors.
There are many possible applications for this technique. For instance, one could search for eigenvalues within a
preassigned frequency range[18]. By performing several runs with a diﬀerent choice of ω0 it is also possible to obtain
an estimate of the whole density of states (DOS). To this aim, we will assume that the eigenvalues i of H are known,
and show how the overall average kinetic temperature, obtained by a δ-thermostat trajectory, is related to the DOS.

The frequencies of the normal modes of the artiﬁcial dynamics will be ωi =

where T ω0 is the scaled temperature proﬁle (9). By construction, T ω0 (ωi ) ∼ δ(ω0 − ωi ), so that the connection
between (10) and the density of states (DOS) of the eigenvalue spectrum of H is readily found:

Figure 3: The eigenvalues density D( ) as computed from a δ-thermostat dynamics, for a matrix with uniformly-distributed eigenvalues between 1
and 10 (lower panel) and for a matrix corresponding to a linear chain of masses connected by springs, with periodic boundaries (upper panel). In
both cases, a 1000 × 1000 matrix has been used for H, and 4 · 106 timesteps of 0.05 time units each have been performed for each run. The exact
DOS (dashed line) is compared with the analytical predictions for T¯ (ω0 ) (continuous line) and with the average kinetic temperatures computed
from actual runs (dots). For the latter, the errorbar is smaller than the size of the points.

We will now consider, as a simple illustration, how the spectrum of two simple matrices can be analyzed using the
same set of parameters reported in Appendix B. Namely, we will consider a matrix with evenly-spaced eigenvalues
between 1 and 10, and one corresponding to the dynamical matrix of a linear chain of masses connected by springs,
with periodic boundary conditions and an on-site term. In this second case, the eigenvalues of a matrix of size N are
i = α − 2β cos(2πi/N); α and β are chosen so that i ’s lie between 1 and 10.
Results for this two problems are reported in Figure 3. The actual outcome of the dynamics is identical to the
predictions one can draw from Eq. (10), demonstrating that the errors due to ﬁnite time-step in the integration are
negligible. The distribution of the eigenvalues is quantitatively reproduced, but for the points where the actual DOS
has features “sharper” than the resolution of the δ-thermostat. From this point of view, it is worth noting that the
scaling procedure we used to shift the same ﬁtted parameters to diﬀerent peak frequencies guarantees constant relative
resolution, i.e. the breadth of the peak is a constant fraction of ω0 . This explains the asymmetry between the two peaks
of the DOS in the linear chain panel of Figure 3.
The resolution can be further improved, at the expense however of a lower sampling eﬃciency. The performance
of this approach compared to traditional methods depends on the size of the matrix, its condition number and the
desired resolution and accuracy. As it is the case for any stochastic method, in fact, the statistical error decreases
slowly, with the square root of the sampling time. A quantitative discussion is beyond the scope of the present work,
and will be the subject of a future publication, where applications to realistic problems will be presented. We can
anticipate that our approach would be more useful to qualitatively probe the eigenvalue spectrum than to obtain a very
precise estimate of the density of states.
6. Conclusions
In the present paper, a new shade of colored-noise Langevin dynamics has been described. We named it δthermostat, because of its ability to selectively excite vibrational modes whose frequencies lie within a narrow range.
We described its application to molecular dynamics, using ice Ih as test case. In this ﬁeld, it could be useful to speed
up a transition depending critically on a speciﬁc vibrational frequency, or in general to model the application of an
intense, monochromatic perturbation in order to study the subsequent relaxation. We also discussed, and demonstrated
on two simple test cases, how δ-thermostat dynamics can be used to estimate the spectrum of a large, sparse matrix.

From a broader perspective, this paper proves further the ﬂexibility of generalized Langevin equation as a tool to
assist molecular dynamics simulations, and suggests that it might ﬁnd application to other areas of scientiﬁc computation. The approach we have presented here and in related publications[8–10] is particularly convenient, since many
diﬀerent eﬀects can be achieved with the very same computational framework, by a simple change of the parameters
entering the GLE.

Appendix A. Combining memory kernels
In Ref. [10] we have described some scaling rules which allow one perform simple transformations of the frequency and temperature range of a given GLE thermostat. We now discuss a set of combination rules which can be
used to combine two GLE thermostats into a new one, whose memory kernels will be a combination of the ones of
the original SDEs. However, at variance with matrix rescaling which generates a dynamics whose properties can be
simply obtained from the ones of the original SDE, there is no simple relationship between the static and dynamic
properties of the mixture GLE and those of its components.

For simplicity we have written down only the free-particle limit of Eqs. (1) and (2), but the position-momentum
coupling can be introduced without changing the reasoning nor the ﬁnal result. It is to be understood that 1 A p and 1 B p
generate the memory kernels K1 (t) and H1 (t) and so on.
It is then simple to prove, by direct substitution into Eqs. (3), that the non-Markovian SDE with memory kernels
K(t) = w1 K1 (t) + w2 K2 (t) and H(t) = w1 H1 (t) + w2 H2 (t) can be obtained from a Markovian process whose matrices

Combining this result with the possibility of having δ-like kernels (6), one obtains in principle a recipe to construct
kernels of arbitrary shape. Let us stress that this procedure does not substitute the ﬁtting described in Ref. [10],
since there is not a straightforward connection between the memory kernels and all the properties of the dynamical
trajectory which are useful to custom-tailor the GLE thermostat. Moreover, even if the target is to reproduce a given
pair of memory kernels, an explicit ﬁtting procedure allows to obtain a good agreement with a much smaller number
of additional degrees of freedom than it would be needed when combining a large number of matrices in the form (4).
