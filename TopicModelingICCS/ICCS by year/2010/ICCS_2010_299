Abstract
Many Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) in the United States lack sufficient resources and knowledge to take significant
advantage of the national and international computational resources available to advance computational science research and
education. National challenges raised for Homeland Security (HS) have focused US government attention on the critical yet
untapped human resource potential at MSIs. The US National Science Foundation¬∂V7HUD*ULGKDVDWWHPSWHGWRGHILQHSURPRWH
and deliver an integrated set of high performance computing resources to the national academic research community. However, a
gap persists in the connections between the TeraGrid program and non-TeraGrid national computational resources and data. For
MSIs and other users, these circumstances hinder seamless, natural use of resources from local, campus infrastructure through
national high performance computing research tools. In spite of impressive TeraGrid advances, its user community falls short of
engaging a much broader potential community especially the MSI community. A campus-based integrated CyberInfrastructure
(CI) is essential to bridge this gap.

followed by descriptions of its Institutional Capacity Building for CI (CI campus assessments etc) and Building
the CI-enabled MSI Research Capability. A Summary of MSI-CIEC accomplishments ends the paper.
Notable are the increased capabilities these activities generate for MSIs to engage in CI research, curriculum
and education advancement. Such undertakings, for example, provide capability for MSIs to engage more efficiently
in e-science- a new approach based on computer simulation / visualization and rapidly being adapted as one of the
most successful modern methods for experimental scientific discovery. Another example lies in the efficiency and
low cost of Cloud Computing (programs and services delivered over the internet) which is changing the way we use
computers and related resources and for which CI software applications become a facilitative technology. In all
areas Security issues abound and become especially significant for HS efforts where engaging MSIs can enhance
this workforce.

termed CyberInfrastructure (CI). CyberInfrastructure integrates hardware for computing, data and networks,
digitally-enabled sensors, observatories and experimental facilities, and an interoperable suite of software and
middleware services and tools. Investments in interdisciplinary teams and CyberInfrastructure professionals with
expertise in algorithm development, system operations, and applications development are also essential to exploit
the full power of CyberInfrastructure to create, disseminate, and preserve scientific data, information and

expertise, tools, and facilities in powerful ways that have the potential to significantly advance discovery. An
essential enabler of this vision is an ability to coordinate the use of public sector information technology across
scales, from desktop to TeraGrid. MSI-CIEC strives to create and implement a model for that coordination, building
a seamless application development and deployment, technical support, training, and personal communications
bridge from desktop to TeraGrid.
1.2 Minority Serving Institutions- CyberInfrastructure Empowerment Coalition
MSI-CIEC provides a broad systemic approach to reaching underrepresented minority students and engaging
WKLV QDWLRQ¬∂V $PHULFDQ ,QGLDQ 7ULEDO &ROOHJHV 7&8 DQG 8QLYHUVLWLHV +LVSDQic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and
Historically and Predominantly Black Institutions in the exploration, dissemination and adoption of CI tools,
services and initiatives supporting research and education. The three organizations (AIHEC- American Indian
Higher Education Consortium; HACU- Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities; and NAFEO- National
Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education) leading this project represent the broadest coalition of MSIs
in American higher education. These organizations are represented in MSI-CIEC by their Technology Directors
respectively: Al Kuslikis, Alex Ramirez and Karl Barnes. They are joined by Diane Baxter of San Diego
Supercomputer Center, Geoffrey Fox of Pervasive Technology Institute, Indiana and Richard A, Al√≥, Center for
Computational Science at University of Houston Downtown.
Engaging MSIs is an efficient way of reaching the growing number of underrepresented minority college
students, the next generation of scientists and engineers. Although only a relatively small percentage of colleges
and universities in the country, MSIs serve a much greater proportion of underrepresented minority students, (e.g.,
HSIs are about 6% of US higher education institutions, but produce 33%, of Hispanic science baccalaureates while
HBCUs produce the same percentage for African Americans) [NSB04]. AIHEC and HACU are the only national
associations representing TCUs and HSIs, respectively while NAFEO has served as an advocate for historically and
predominantly black colleges and universities since 1969. MSI-CIEC is able to attract notable national computing
experts to plan, design and implement effective practices that broaden participation and impact on society and the
next generation of scientists and engineers.
MSI-CIEC has been established as a virtual organization to accelerate the development of a CI-related STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce with the following:
Vision:

To advance STEM and participation of US traditionally underrepresented minorities in STEM and in
the global STEM workforce, particularly e-science, through MSIs and the emerging CI.

Mission:

To build/ enhance the social and technological mechanisms for meaningful engagement of MSIs in CI.

diverse STEM workforce, including the current and next generation of the STEM professoriate in an increasingly
diverse society.
The project establishes a dynamic community of learning and practice, a CI-enabled distributed research and
education network providing e-science education and research opportunities to MSI faculty and students. It exploits
the synergies between CI for science and engineering and the environments supporting electronic business and
communities, enabling MSIs as both national research institutions and as regional economic development hubs. This
was immediately recognized by the US Department of Homeland Security as a much needed resource for the
development of future workforce and for expanding its research base.
Motivation for MSI-CIEC The NSF report, Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and
Engineering [NS07], states that minorities will comprise more than half (52%) of the resident college-age (18¬±24
years old) population of the United States by 2050. Between 2002 - 2007, computer science departments across the
country have shown large declines in enrollment [V07a]. Yet, our traditionally underrepresented minorities
constitute about 1% of doctoral engineers in 2005-2006. The small number of minority faculty, combined with need

for minority role models and mentors, perpetuates a troublesome cycle of underrepresentation in science,
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. With globalization and the increasing competitiveness of other
countries in STEM, the United States is in danger of losing its leadership in these areas [CS07] unless it mobilizes

(NSF project #9980537) by strengthening and expanding a distributed community of researchers, faculty, and
students who participate collaboratively to provide CI executive awareness, training and support, pilot new CI tools
that support the distributed research and education process, and plan and implement specific research and education
projects. This virtual organization of MSIs and CI stakeholders leverages resources from across the MSI and CI
communities, providing the foundation for CI-enabled MSI research programs that are prepared to provide a major
contribution to the national research agenda.
2. Institutional Capacity Building for CI
To support MSI-CIEC institutions in their adoption of CI as an institutional development strategy, MSI-CIEC
supports institutional capacity building through campus assessment and technical assistance visits. Services
provided are intended to help participating MSIs progress toward acquiring and maintaining the hardware and
connectivity needed for a significant level of CI engagement, as well as possibly becoming CI resource providers,
such as local or regional computing, data storage, application, tools and other CI resources. The CI Access
Empowerment Team is coordinated by co PIs, Dr. Geoffrey Fox, Indiana University and Karl Barnes from
NAFEO.
2.1 MSI CI Survey
MSI-CIEC develops a brief CI capacity and use survey that MSIs are asked to complete online. There are both
institutional and faculty components. The survey results provide an overview of the current infrastructure and
campus plans relative to the emergent CI and related science domains at MSIs, as well as, information to support
portal and professional development training design and to populate the social network collaboration directory. A
summary of the information gathered is disseminated to institutions, federal agencies, and industry partners
.
2.2 Campus Technical Assistance Visits
To assess the current state of computing and IT at participating MSIs and to identify specific gaps or CI campus
needs, MSI-CIEC provides technical assistance campus visits MSI-CIEC tailored to match the specific computing
and networking development plans and needs of selected MSIs. Site visit teams include one or more experts
(faculty, staff, administrator or consultants) with specific expertise in computing and networking infrastructure,
applications, CI research, CI education, or strategic planning. The site visit teams provide administrators, faculty,
and staff information about CI-enabled opportunities for strengthening STEM research and education programs.
They facilitate CI-focused strategic planning by the college community. The site visit team provides on-site and
written recommendations on strategies for improvement, reference material, and ongoing assistance, as needed. All
materials and information, including information on new computing and networking infrastructures, technologies,
and their applications, are made available for other campuses to utilize through the project portal and linked to the
AIHEC, HACU and NAFEO web sites.
2.4 CI Technical Assistance
CI Technical Assistance helps participating MSIs strengthen their capacity to build and manage CI-enabled
collaborative environments and services, and more effective technology utilization to deliver and manage services,
information, and resources to community members using open-source tools and services. It provides technical
recommendations and support in the acquisition and maintenance by MSIs of the infrastructure necessary to both
access and contribute to the national CI, e.g. clusters, AG nodes, and connectivity costs. MSIs are assisted in
identifying opportunities to contribute computational, data and other services and resources to the national grid, and
possible funding models and opportunities. MSI-&,(&DFFHVVHVLWVSDUWQHUVKLS¬∂VUHVRXUFHVWRVXSSRUW06, IT staff in

2.5 Participating MSIs
Participating MSIs are selected to participate in the project based upon an initial survey review of the MSI
capabilities and needs, and where we can have the most strategic impact on CI and on demonstrating the potential of
CI to MSIs and a clear model for other MSIs to follow. Two exemplars are Navajo Technical College and
Elizabeth City State University Projects as described here.

Navajo Technical College: Internet to the Hogan Project (Inauguration at Navajo Tech shown in photo
below) is a High Performance Networking; Cluster/Grid Computing Project focused on the Navajo Nation and the
College. It is a result of our first CI Day activity and is a Collaboration of MSI CIEC and our Partners
including
¬á San Diego Supercomputer Center
¬á TeraGrid
¬á National Center for Supercomputer Applications
¬á Working with HSI University of New Mexico
¬á SDSC High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network connecting to the National Lambda Rail
and Internet 2 at OC3 speeds
As a result NTC is expanding degree offerings through PhD and curriculum activities for Navajo K-12

As one of the MSI-CIEC model institutions for engagement in CyberInfrastructure, discussions and planning
have commenced with Navajo Technical College to develop Web 2.0 curriculum to assist with the recruitment and
retention of MSI students into CI related computer science as a major.
¬á Web 2.0 applications have gained in popularity among young students.
¬á Web 2.0 has some potential for application within CI particularly social collaborations, virtual organizations
and possibly even scientific applications, such as a more user friendly interface to TeraGrid or science
gateways. It may aid in the development of CI applications or interfaces for the Navajo nation's computing grid
currently under development.
¬á The same is true for the Elizabeth City State University computer grid and high performance network described
below.
Elizabeth City State University was site of the second CI Day event held on January 3-4, 2008 at Elizabeth
City State University (ECSU), a 3000-student Historically Black University in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, that
receives its high-speed internet connection to the Grid through the North Carolina Research Engineering Network
(NCREN). The goals of 'CIDays at ECSU' were to (1) provide faculty, staff, and administrators there with
information about CI developments in education and research, (2) create networking opportunities with national CI
organizations and experts, and (3) provide breakout sessions for faculty within each of the university's four colleges
to brainstorm how CI might be used in ECSU classrooms and labs. Most of the university's top administrators were
present, including the provost, the deans from each of the university's four schools, and the Chief Information
Officer. A total of 90 ECSU faculty, staff, and administrators registered and provided their email addresses at the
Friday portion of the event.
In order to measure the initial impact of the event and solicit feedback on how future CI Days could be
improved, these 90 individuals were emailed an online evaluation survey in the weeks that followed. The survey
was supposed to go out the evening of January 4th, but due to some miscommunication with event planners and
other delays, it was not sent out by the provost's office until January 24th. The recipients were given one week to

complete the survey, and 31 did so, for a response rate of 34%. Due to the 3-week delay in the survey's delivery and
the relatively low response rate, the survey results reported here should not be considered a representative and
definitive sample of attendee's opinions about the event, but they do give a good sense of the general response to the
event, what sessions were particularly useful, and what attendees hope to do with regards to CI in the future.
Resulting from this activity and its evaluation the following project evolved:

3. Building the CI-enabled MSI Research Capability
The main strategy for engaging MSIs into CI research involves bringing MSI faculty into the growing CIsupported research community. MSI-CIEC provides a brokering function between individual CI researchers,
national and international e-science programs, their researchers and faculty, and MSI faculty, identifying
opportunities for MSI faculty and students to collaborate on research projects as research fellows or interns, research
personnel, or co-PIs. The CI Research Empowerment Team is coordinated by co-PI Ramirez for domain sciences
and Dr. Richard Al√≥ for computer science.
3.1 Research Support for MSI faculty and students
MSI-CIEC facilitates research collaborations by:
¬á Residential training at SDSC and Argonne National Lab
¬á building an online social network site with a research collaboration directory where majority and minority CI
researchers and MSI faculty/ graduate students can present personal background and contact information,
research interests, including keywords for classification and keyword searches, current and past research
projects, presentations/ publications, desires for specific or general research collaboration, discussions/ idea
exchange, or professional development, current/ past collaborators with links to their information, favourite
research related sites and other personal web sites, and facilitating others to join and build the social network;

visiting faculty/student exchange and research symposia;
collaborative proposal development and identifying fellowships, internships and other research opportunities for
faculty and graduate/undergraduate students, leveraging NSF programs such as Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REUs), at universities/colleges, (including MSIs), major e-Science research centers, national
labs, and CI resource sites (SDSC, NCSA, etc.)

3.2 CI-mediated Research Training
A component of the MSI CI survey is completed by faculty who are asked to identify their research and
collaboration interests. The responses are used to help connect potential research collaborators based on similar
interests and strategic opportunities to collaborate, and to populate some of the information for the online research
community networking directory.
MSI research faculty are recruited to participate in the residential training program at SDSC and Argonne
National Lab in Chicago. They are encouraged to attend the training event of most relevance to their research
interests with expectation that they should embark upon a CI-related research project in collaboration with existing
CI programs. The project team helps facilitate such collaborations as needed. Opportunities for interpersonal
interaction are built into the training program to enable exchange of ideas and development of research
collaborations some of which will enable informal, genuine mentoring of faculty and students. Informal short-term
mentoring takes place in follow-up to the training program. In addition, MSI-CIEC continues to develop and foster
partnerships with major research institutions, national laboratories, and federal agencies that support advanced
technologies research and development.
3.3. Visiting Faculty/Student Research Symposia
MSI-CIE encourages Visiting Faculty/Student Research Symposia program where potential research
collaborators may be invited to visit a campus, MSI or majority institution, a national lab, CI resource or e-science
research facility, or meeting of a distributed research group to exchange research ideas, explore possible research
collaborations, make research plans and give an open talk to faculty and students about current or potential research.
3.4. Research Proposal Development
Members of the CI Research Empowerment Team together with others recruited within the MSI-CIEC
partnership identify and disseminate research funding opportunities and provide technical support for collaborative
research proposal development for projects that involve MSI faculty in CI and e-science.

Often the different NSF activities in this area all work with the same rather small group of people. We suggested
proactive projects like CI-days as one approach to this issue. Another more speculative idea is to develop Web 2.0
style portals for community building and scientific discovery as Web 2.0 allows a broad range of people to
participate with low barriers. Thus we are developing a MSI portal built with Web 2.0 to foster communities.

science gateways to TeraGrid aimed at education.
In addition there are very interesting developments in TeraGrid that have been facilitated by MSI CIEC. In
2008, several members of the GEON team and the TeraGrid Science Gateways Area Director travelled from SDSC
to Navajo Tech to present a workshop for their faculty. They immediately saw how the GEON tools and
applications could be useful for their research and education, and they plan to adopt them for their own purposes.

MSI-CIEC, TeraGrid, and SDSC. The workshop was follow-on to participation by two Navajo Tech faculty in the
GEON Summer Institute. GEON funded all their expenses and hopes to work with MSI CIEC in the future to recruit
more minority scientists and graduate students to participate in their annual summer institute. Another Geon
Summer Institute was held in the summer of 2009 at the SDSC.

MSI-CIEC has undertaken Campus Assessments at Elizabeth City State University, Navajo Technical College,
New Mexico Highlands University, University of Houston Downtown, University of Texas Pan American and
1RUWK'DNRWD¬∂V$OO-Tribes University. In addition we also undertook a CI Day event at these institutions and also at
Howard University.
There are MSIs that have either made some inroads into CI or have projects that can be CI enabled and with
whom MSI-CIEC can assist in expanding their research and curriculum activities. For example, California State
University, San Bernardino, has started a new bioinformatics program which the project could help support and
insure that it incorporates CI in its research and education. University of Texas at Brownsville is a small campus in
the UT system which is making some impressive gains in gravitational wave astronomy research and is participating
in the Open Science Grid. It provides a cost effective model for developing a campus for CI access. Bowie State
University has invested in a large scale system, and assistance here could help bring the campus sciences into CI
activity, and conceivably provide a regional CI resource. Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute working with
University of New Mexico could demonstrate how collaboration between a two-year Tribal College and a four-year
HSI could help both campuses become more engaged in CI and enhance the STEM education and transfer
articulation. Howard University, Universidad de Sagrado Corazon, Florida International University and Crownpoint
Institute of Technology, Little Priest Tribal College, Our Lady of the Lake University and other MSIs have
expressed interest.
MSI-CIEC is a partner in the new Homeland Security Center of Excellence n Command, Control and
Interoperability housed at Purdue University, http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/.
This center is
focused on Visual Analytics for Command, Control and Interoperability Network Environments (VACCINE) and as
such CI tools and resources play an important role. MSI-CIEC provides to its MSIs opportunities to participate in
the collaborative research and training efforts of this new Center which will bring our MSI students into the Security
workforce.
