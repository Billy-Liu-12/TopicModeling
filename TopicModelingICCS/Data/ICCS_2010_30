Abstract
The reaction mechanism of the Wolff-like ring contraction in a five-membered iridacycle (A, diazoalkane compound) at room
temperature was studied by density functional theory (DFT). The calculation indicates an exothermic reaction favored by -31.5
kcal/mol with a barrier of 26.4 kcal/mol in free energy and a concerted mechanism, in which the extrusion of N2 and the 1,3-shift
rearrangement in the diazo complex (A) occurs simultaneously. The facilitation of Ir(III) lowers the barrier for the rearrange
undergoing at room temperature without the need of the activation by heat or light in the conventional organic version.
Furthermore, the frontier molecular oribital analysis shows that LUMO+3, which is largely localized on the central metal and the
coordinating CO, in A is able to strongly interact with the “carbenoid” carbon atom when N2 is released. The corresponding
addition of the carbenoid carbon to this carbonyl is located as an alternative reaction path. The calculated barrier is 5.5 kcal/mol
higher in free energy than that for the major product as found in the experiment. This study not only points out the orbital
interactions in the active intermeidate but also provides an alternative reaction path to develop further applications for this
iridium complex

1. Introduction
The Wolff rearrangement converts an α-diazo-ketone into a ketene [1, 2] and one of its major applications is ring
contraction of cyclic ketones, such as the synthesis of cyclobutanes from α,β-diazocyclopentanones.[1, 3] The
reaction is usually initiated by expelling of N2 with light or heat to create a carbenic intermediate. A sequential 1,2shift of α-carbon to the carbenic atom follows to achieve the ring contraction (Scheme 1). Apparently, the harsh
reaction condition prohibits its wide application in organic or organometallic synthesis.
Recently, a transition metal organometallic version of the Wolff contraction has been reported.[4] A contracted
four-membered iridacycle 5 was produced via an unusual rearrangement when the α-formyl-3-iridacyclopentanone 1
was treated with the azide TsN3 (Ts = 4-NO2-C6H4-SO2), as shown in Scheme 2. Instead of 1,2-shift in the
conventional Wolff rearrangement that involves the α-carbon of the carbonyl group, the ring contraction occurs

through a 1,3-shift with a terminal alkene formed and the carbonyl kept intact. The suggested mechanism was to
release N2 first that leaves a carbene intermediate A and iridium atom, then it attacks the carbenic carbon to form

2. Computational Details
The theoretical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 03[7] implementation of Tao-PerdewStaroverov-Scuseria (TPSS)[8] density functional theory (DFT). As a new generation of density functional, TPSS
matches or even exceeds in accuracy almost all prior functionals, including the most popular functional-B3LYP.[9]
Stuttgart/Dresden (SDD) basis set was applied for the iridium atom with the effective core potential (ECP)[10] and
an f-polarization function added[11] while 6-31++G(d',p') basis sets were used for B, C, N, O and H atoms.[12-14]
This basis set combination is defined as BS-I. Also, density fitting functions were included to accelerate the
computation with DFT. Density fitting functions can be included for this pure DFT—and only pure DFT—to save
tremendous computational expense by expanding the density in a set of atom-centered functions when computing
the Coulomb interaction instead of computing all of the two-electron integrals.[15, 16] A comparison of TPSS with
or without density fitting functions included for an organometallic reaction shows only marginal difference for both
relative energies and structural parameters. TPSS reproduces these properties at least as precisely as B3LYP.
Especially, TPSS can recognize relatively weak interactions (such as agostic interactions) very well while B3LYP
significantly underestimates them. Furthermore, using smaller basis sets for the atoms far from the reaction center
does not degrade the computational precision and accuracy significantly but can accelerate the calculations
considerably.[17] All structures were fully optimized and frequency analyses were performed to ensure a minimum
or transition state was achieved. Furthermore, all transition states were confirmed with the intrinsic reaction
coordinate (IRC) method[18, 19] to connect to the corresponding reactants and products. The thermodynamic
functions, including enthalpies, entropies and free energies, were calculated at 298.15 K and 1 atm.
To further test the robustness and reliability of the TPSS functional used in the simulations, various DFT
methods, including B3LYP[20, 21], B3PW91[20, 22], O3LYP[21, 23, 24], OLYP[21, 23], M05 and M05-2X[25],
were employed to perform single point energy (SPE) calculations with BS-I upon the geometries optimized by

2661

TPSS. The basis set utilized for these functionals is the same as that for the optimization. For the OLYP functional,
density fitting functions are also included since it is also a pure DFT.
Furthermore, to examine basis set effect, a larger basis set combination, in which the basis set for Ir was kept the
same as that mentioned above while 6-311++(d,p)[12, 14] were used for all non-metal atoms (BS-II), was also
implemented with B3LYP and TPSS functionals to perform the single point energy (SPE) calculation.
3. Results and discussions
As shown in Scheme 3, two reaction paths, one leading to the product 5 that was observed as the product in the
experiment while another to intermediate B by addition to the Ir-coordinating carbonyl, were located. The π-ligand
in B could dissociate to form a five-coordinated Ir complex C. The reaction barrier is 26.4 kcal/mol for the former
path and the product 5 is more stable by 31.5 kcal/mol, relative to the reactant A, in free energy. On the other hand,
the free energy barrier leading to the intermediate B, which is 7.9 kcal/mol more stable than A, is 31.9 kcal/mol in
the latter path. The five-coordinated species C could form by overcoming a barrier of 11.2 kcal/mol and it is only
more stable than the transition state, TS3, by 1.1 kcal/mol in free energy. All the corresponding data are listed in
Table 1 and the relative free energies profile is visualized in Figure 1. All the species involved in the reaction paths
will be discussed in detail as follow.

First of all, the reactant A, generated from α-formyl-3-iridacyclopentanone 1 treated with azide in the experiment
(See Scheme 2), was located and its structure is shown in Figure 2. In this six-coordinated complex, the tridentate
ligand TpMe2 and the carbon monoxide provide four σ-donors bonding to Ir while the two methylenes within the
iridacyclopentanone ring form two covalent bonds to the metal, resulting in an Ir(III) center. The lengths of the
three Ir-N bonds range from 2.16 to 2.21 Å and
the length of the bond between Ir and CO is

and no intermediate or transition state was observed in the process of optimization.
Furthermore, the relative free energies of species A, TS1 and 5(+ N2) computed with different density functional
and basis sets were listed in Table 2. Excluding density fitting functions, TPSS with basis set BS-I almost produced
the identical relative free energies to that with density fitting functions. This phenomenon was also observed with
OLYP functional. But the computational cost increased by at least 3-fold. B3LYP and M05-2x gave close barriers
to TPSS while B3PW91, O3LYP, OLYP and M05 resulted in higher barrier by 2.4-5.1 kcal/mol. Compared to
TPSS, all other functionals presented larger stability of structure 5 with N2, by the values ranging from 0.9 to 6.0
kcal/mol. To B3LYP functional, larger basis set BS-II provided slightly higher barrier and more stable products by
0.7 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively.

calculation for the TPSS-optimized geometries.

3.1. Reaction mechanism for the ring contraction
Diazo (A) and carbene (A') intermediates The methylenes coordinating to Ir do not have low-laid unoccupied
π*-symmetric orbitals while the CO has not one but two highly matching empty orbitals for back-bonding from the
metal center. Namely, the π-back-bonding to the pyrazolyl ligand trans to the CO is much weaker than the other
two trans to the methylenes. As a result, the former coordination bond is significantly shorter the latter two by 0.030.05 Å. The key intermediate A (Scheme 2), which is proposed as the precursor to generate carbene by extrusion of
N2 for further reactions, was located as a minimum. As shown in Figure 2, the central Ir(III) is six-coordinated by
the tridentate ligand TpMe2, one carbon monoxide and two methylenes within the iridacyclopentanone ring. This
iridacyclic five-member ring is tipping towards the carbonyl ligand because of the steric effect from the methyl

group in the axial dimethylpyrazolyl ligand, which is trans to the carbonyl. The N-N bond length of 1.150 Å in the
diazo, which is slightly longer than 1.111 Å in N2, which indicates the weakened triple bond character. The partial
charges, computed with the atomic polar tensor,26 on N1 and N2 are -0.652 and 0.871, respectively. Apparently,
depriving of electron density on these two N atoms by the iridacycle moiety lowers the bond order between them.
The carbene intermediate A', generated from A by releasing of N2, is supposedly the active intermediate
responsible for the rearrangement that results in the ring contraction and produces the compound 5 (Scheme 2). No
minimum on the potential energy surface was located for this carbene as the initial geometry for A' was kept the
same as A with the diazo group removed. As long as the diazo group was removed from A, the structure was
spontaneously optimized to the product 5 without any detectable barrier at the theoretical level employed in the
calculation. The partial optimization was also performed with a constraint set on the iridacyclic ring but again
structure 5 (Figure 1) was obtained when the constraint was released.
Four-membered iridacyclic product 5 The product of the ring contraction rearrangement was located and the
structure is shown in Figure 1. Compared with the crystal structure,4 the geometry was almost perfectly reproduced
in the calculaton and all bond lengths from the calculation only deviated by less than 0.05 Å. The most deviated
bonds are those most exposed, such as the Ir-bound carbonyl and the terminal C-C double bond. The lengths of the
Ir-C5, C5-O2 and C1-C2 are longer than those in the crystal by 0.055-0.057 Å. Although this kind of deviation is
within computational error it is also possilbe that the intermolecular interactions affect the structure to some extent
in the crystal packing pattern.
The bond angles of the four-member ring are also similar to the experiment and the differences are less than 5º.
The experimental measured angles of C2-Ir-C4, Ir-C2-C3, C2-C3-C4 and Ir-C4-C3 are 68.5º, 96.4º, 101.5º and

93.2º, respectively; while in the optimized structure they are 72.2º, 93.5º, 105.5º and 88.7º, respectively.
Transition state leading to 5 As stated above, the carbene intermediate A' was not found at theoretical level
used in this study, the concerted mechanism (or SN2-like), instead of the stepwise mechanism (or SN1-like), was
considered instead. The transition state (TS1) connecting A and 5 was located and its structure is shown in Figure 1.
The direct connection from TS1 to A or 5 was confirmed by IRC calculations.
Apparently, the diazo group is a good leaving group and eventually it is released as N2. Compared to A, the bond
length (1.122 Å) of N1-N2 in TS1 is shortened by 0.03 Å, which is only 0.01 Å longer than that in free N2. The
bond between the diazo and C2 is drastically weakened and the bond length elongated by 0.6 Å relative to that in A.
The metal is approaching C2 at a distance of 2.619 Å, which is short enough to have bonding characters.
Furthermore, the C1-C2 is shortened to 1.443 Å to transform into a double bond. Not so surprisingly, the rest part
of this species does not noticeably change compared to the diazo compound A.
3.2. Byproduct path and species involved
The leaving of N2 creates a very reactive carbene-like carbon atom. It is confirmed that it reacts with Ir to form
the four-membered species 5. However, the possibility for it to react with other atoms, such as the Ir-coordinating
carbonyl, in the molecule A cannot be ruled out.
Indeed, this carbon atom is able to react with the carbonyl that bound to Ir. As shown in Figure 1, C2 attacks the
metal-bound carbonyl in the transition state (TS2) to form compound B. In TS2, the distance between C2 and C5 is
shortened to 1.700 Å while C2-N1 increases by 0.17 Å relative to that in A. Interestingly, in structure B, the C1-C2
double bond is also formed and this π-bond orbital bonds to Ir as an η2-ligand. The distances from Ir to C1 and C2
are 2.179 Å and 2.134 Å, respectively, while the bond length of C1-C2 is slightly longer than C-C double bond in
alkenes by about 0.1 Å. These three distances indicate that this η2-ligand primarily forms a dative bond to Ir and the
back-bonding from Ir’s d orbitals is rather weak since the C1-C2 bond keeps most of the double bond characters.
Likely, the strain from the five-member ring containing Ir, C2, C3, C4 and C5 makes this π-dative bond not in its
perfect position. C1 has to tip towards to effectively bond to Ir and as a result, C1, C2, C3 and C4 are far from
planer. Thus, this π-dative bond tends to be weak in order to release the strain upon the sp2 carbon C2. The
corresponding species was shown as structure C in Figure 1 where the bond is formed between Ir and the C1-C2
double bond. Differing from all other species shown in Figure 1, the metal center is not coordinately saturated with
geometry of square-pyramid and leaves one site open. The transition state (TS3) for the breaking of this π-dative
bond was also found. But since it is very close to species C, TS3 is not shown in Figure 1
3.3. Free energy profile for the reaction and orbital interactions
Based on the computational data, the formation of 5 from A is an exothermic reaction by -31.5 kcal/mol with a
barrier of 26.4 kcal/mol in free energy (See Table 1 and Figure 2). The large amount of energy, generated by the
reaction, is gained from the formation of N2 and the stabilization of the carbene-like carbon atom by Ir, apparently.
On the other hand, the barrier leading to B is 31.9 kcal/mol, which is 5.5 kcal/mol higher than that to 5.
Converted to reaction rates, it is almost 5000 times faster to form 5 than to form B at room temperature and that is
why no B was observed in the experiment. B is more stable than A by 7.9 kcal/mol in free energy primarily gained
from the entropy of N2 release. Rearranging to C by breaking the dative bond from the C1-C2 double bond to Ir is
endothermic by 10.1 kcal/mol. That is to say, the releasing of ring strain is unable to compensate the dissociation of
the π-dative donor. But if another stronger ligand, such as free CO, can saturate the site that the dissociation leaves,
species C could be significantly stabilized. Introducing of an external CO stabilizes the system by more than 40
kcal/mol in free energy according to our DFT calculations. Namely, C might be able to be captured in the presence
of CO if it is produced. The transition state (TS3) is structurally similar to C and it is only 1.1 kcal/mol less stable
than C in free energy.

Figure 3. The frontier molecular orbitals of A. Coordination bonds from the TpMe2 ligand to Ir are not shown for clarity.

As shown in Figure 3, the LUMO+1, LUMO, HOMO and HOMO-1 are highly localized on the diazo, the
conjugated C2 and carbonyl (C3-O1) in the intermediate A while LUMO+3 and LUMO+2 are primarily distributed
on Ir and the Ir-bonding carbonyl. As a result, the symmetry of these two orbitals will not be significantly disturbed
when N2 dissociates. Thus, the pseudo carbene (C2) can easily interact with them. LUMO+3 will be more favored
because its symmetry matches the carbene’s. Since the orbital distributions on Ir and the carbonyl are comparably
similar, the carbene can react with either of them. However, one should point out that the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3
is relatively high in energy, which might hinder their ability to form a strong interaction with metal center.
Nevertheless, it is very possible that Ir and the carbonyl have similar probability to form a bond to the carbene but
the considerably higher barrier via TS2 than that via TS1 prohibits the formation of B in the experiment.
4. Conclusions
In the “conventional” Wolff rearrangement, the formation of carbenoid intermediate is triggered by heat or light,
which means the releasing of N2 is a high-energy process. But with the help of the transition metal in complex A,
the leaving of N2 occurs at room temperature without using any initiator. The unoccupied orbitals on Ir(III) is able
to stabilize the carbenoid atom when the diazo group is releasing according to the frontier orbital analysis on A.
In summary, the unoccupied orbitals, largely localized on Ir and carbonyl, in A is responsible for this
organometallic version of Wolff Rearrangement. As a result the (pseudo)carbene, by the releasing of N2, prefers to
react directly with the metal. The activation free energy is 26.4 kcal/mol. The symmetry of the unoccupied orbital
also indicates the possibility for the reaction between the carbene and the carbon monoxide. Although the reaction

with the carbonyl is higher energy by 5.5 kcal/mol, modifications on the ligand involved the Ir(III) complex could
switch these two reaction paths as the energy-disfavored product (C-like) can then be captured by external carbon
monoxide.
