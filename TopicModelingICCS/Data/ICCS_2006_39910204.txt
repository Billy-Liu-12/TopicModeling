Abstract. In this research letter, we introduce a reconstruction formula
in spline signal spaces which is a generalization of former results in [11].
A general improved A-P iterative algorithm is presented. We use the
algorithm to show reconstruction of signals from weighted samples and
also show that the new algorithm shows better convergence than the old
one. The explicit convergence rate of the algorithm is obtained.

Introduction

In the classical sampling problem, the reconstruction of f on Rd from its samples
{f (xj ) : j ∈ J}, where J is a countable indexing set, is one of main tasks in many
applications in signal or image processing. However, this problem is ill-posed, and
becomes meaningful only when the function f is assumed to be bandlimited, or
to belong to a shift-invariant space [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12]. For a bandlimited signal
of ﬁnite energy, it is completely characterized by its samples, and described by
the famous classical Shannon sampling theorem. Obviously, the shift-invariant
space is not a space of bandlimited function unless the generator is bandlimited.
In many real applications, sampling points are not always regular. For example, the sampling steps need to be ﬂuctuated according to the signals so
as to reduce the number of samples and the computational complexity. If a
weighted sampling is considered, the system will be made to be more eﬃcient
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12]. It is well known that spline subspaces yield many advantages
in their generation and numerical treatment so that there are many practical applications for signal or image processing. Therefore, the recent research of spline
subspaces has received much attentions (see[3, 10, 11]).
For practical application and computation of reconstruction, Goh et al.,
showed practical reconstruction algorithm of bandlimited signals from irregular samples in [8], Aldroubi et al., presented a A-P iterative algorithm in [1, 2, 4].
We will improve and generalize the A-P iterative algorithm and also show that
the new algorithm shows better than the old one for convergence rate. That
is, we can easy control the convergence rate of the algorithm with our requirement. At the same time, we don’t increase the number of the sampling point.
But this algorithm is not perfect. Because we immolate(increase) computation
complexity as soon as improve convergence rate of the algorithm.

Reconstruction Algorithm in Spline Spaces

By the special features of spline subspaces, we will present the new improved
A-P algorithm and its convergence rate in spline spaces, which are more explicit.
We introduce some notations and lemmas that will be used in this section.
ck ϕN (· − k) : {ck } ∈ 2 } is spline space generated
The signal space VN = {
k∈Z

by ϕN = χ[0,1] ∗ · · · ∗ χ[0,1] (N convolutions), N ≥ 1.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A general bounded partition of unity(GBPU) is a set of function {βj1 , βj2 , · · · , βjr } that satisfy:
(1) 0 ≤ βj1 , · · · , βjr ≤ 1(∀j1 ≡ j1 (j), · · · , jr ≡ jr (j) ∈ J), where J be countable
separated index set.
(2) suppβj1 ⊂ B δ (xj1 ), · · · , suppβjr ⊂ B δ (xjr ),

(3)
(βj1 + · · · + βjr ) = 1.

In fact, in the case of r = 1, the above GBPU deﬁnition is ordinary BPU
deﬁnition be used in [1, 4].
We will assume that the weight function {ϕxj : xj ∈ X} satisfy the following
properties:
(i) suppϕxj ⊂ B ar (xj )
(ii) there exist M > 0 such that
(iii) Rd ϕxj dx = 1

The other deﬁnitions and notations can be found in [1, 4, 11, 12].

Lemma 2.2. [4] If ϕ is continuous and has compact support, then for any f ∈
V p (ϕ) = {
ck ϕ(· − k) : (ck ) ∈ p }, the following conclusions (i)-(ii) hold:
k∈Z

(i) f Lp ≈ c p ≈ f W (Lp) ,
(ii) V p (ϕ) ⊂ W0 (Lp ) ⊂ W0 (Lq ) ⊂ W (Lq ) ⊂ Lq (R)(1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ ∞).
Lemma 2.3. If f ∈ VN , then for any 0 < δ < 1 we have

In the following, we will show the new improved A-P iterative algorithm from
weighted samples in spline subspace.
Theorem 2.2. Let P be an orthogonal projection from L2 (R) to VN and weight
function satisfy the following three conditions (i)-(iii):
(i) suppϕxj ⊂ [xj − ar , xj + ar ]
(ii) there exist M > 0 such that
(iii) ϕxj (x)dx = 1.

|ϕxj (x)|dx ≤ M,

Remark 2.1. From the constructions of operator Q and A, we know why item
r can appear in the convergence rate expression of the new improved algorithm.
But r is not appear in the old algorithm. Hence this algorithm improves the
convergence rate of the old algorithm. In addition, it is obvious that we can
easily control the convergence rate through choosing proper r without changing
sampling point gap δ. That is, when δ and a are proper given, we can obtain the
convergence rate that we want through choosing proper r. We hope r be enough
large. But we increase the computation complexity as soon as choose larger r.
So we should choose proper r with our requirement.

Conclusion

In this research letter, we discuss in some detail the problem of the weighted
sampling and reconstruction in spline signal spaces and provide a reconstruction
formula in spline signal spaces, which is generalized and improved form of the
results in [11]. Then we give general A-P iterative algorithm in general shiftinvariant spaces, and use the new algorithm to show reconstruction of signals
from weighted samples. The algorithm shows better convergence than the old
one. We study the new algorithm with emphasis on its implementation and
obtain explicit convergence rate of the algorithm in spline subspaces. Due to
the limitation of the page number, we omit some numerical examples, proofs of
lemma and theorem and will show their detail in regular paper.
