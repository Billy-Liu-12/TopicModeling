Abstract
In this paper, we develop the interval dummy variables. In associated with the autoregressive conditional interval
models with exogenous explanatory interval variables (ACIX), we explore the inﬂuences of the sub-prime ﬁnancial
crisis and the European debt crisis on crude oil prices with the proposed interval dummy variables. Hypothesis tests
on the interval dummy variables suggest that the European debt crisis has little impact on the level of crude oil prices,
while it reduces the range of crude oil prices. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis has
signiﬁcant impact on the lower bound of crude oil prices and it increases the volatility of crude oil prices as well.
Moreover, the eﬀect of speculation on crude oil prices is not statistically signiﬁcant in the short run, but is signiﬁcant
in the long run. In addition, our estimation is robust for the choices of Kernel K.
Keywords: Interval dummy variable, ACIX model, Crude oil prices

1. Introduction
The sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis evolved into a global ﬁnancial crisis, and the spreading debt crisis in Europe forced
euro area to get into scrapes, which have potential impact on the crude oil prices, in both the trend (level) and the
volatility (e.g. range, variance). How to accurately characterize the inﬂuences of crisis on crude oil prices and the
ﬂuctuations? A large number of econometric models have been suggested to study the crude oil prices, especially the
point-valued model of crude oil prices are widely used, where the prices in each period are represented by a scalar
(e.g. Kaufmann et al., 2004, 2008; Knetsch, 2007; Halmilton, 2009a,b; Chevillon and Riﬄart, 2009; Alquist and
Kilian, 2010; Wang and Yang, 2010; Bhar et al., 2011; Coleman, 2012). Although point-valued crude oil prices, i.e.,
the closing price, could capture the level information of the underlying stochastic process, it fails to characterize the
volatility of the prices in a given time period. However, crude oil prices can also be expressed by an interval-valued
observation. In practice, interval-valued crude oil prices are of interest for market participants to make decisions on
expenditure plans, risk managements and investments. Especially when ﬁnancial crisis happens, the oil prices present
dramatic ﬂuctuations, which entails the model of changes of crude oil prices in this situation. Following the idea of

Han et al. (2009a, 2011), we introduce the interval dummy variables in ACIX models to study the inﬂuences of the subprime ﬁnancial crisis and the European debt crisis on crude oil prices. Han et al. (2009a) has shown the importance of
modeling interval data in economics and ﬁnance. Compared to point-valued data, interval-valued data maybe of direct
interest and contain more information including both the level and range characteristics of the underlying stochastic
process, and this informational advantage can be exploited for more accurate estimation and inference procedures
in econometrics. We can give rise to interval-valued time series using the maximum and minimum prices from a
sequence of crude oil prices. Applications and discussions of these attributes have aroused increasing attention in
ﬁnancial economics(e.g. Chou, 2005; Brownlees and Gallo, 2010; He et al., 2010).
Compared to other existing models, ACIX model gives the dynamics of interval-valued variables and its relationship with other explanatory variables in a uniﬁed framework, and the minimum DK -distance method in estimating
model parameters can exploit the information contained in interval data. Kernel K is used to adjust the relative importance given to two speciﬁc aspects of interval, i.e., the midpoint and range, and it includes simultaneously the midpoint
and the range information, so the forecasting is more eﬃcient than the one attribute-based method. In addition, ACIX
model is more parsimony than the VEC model, so we can alleviate the overparameterization problem. Because the
crude oil prices and its volatility are important for every investor, in this paper we will explore the impact of the
sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis and the European debt crisis on crude oil prices based on interval-valued ACIX model and
deliver some interpretations about crude oil prices volatility.
In order to accurately measure the impact of crisis on crude oil prices, we propose a new class of interval dummy
variables. Han et al. (2009b) ﬁrstly proposed the primary point-based dummy variables with corresponding intervalvalued coeﬃcients to study the impact of the sub-prime crisis on interval-valued asset prices. However, it imposes
the restriction on the same amount changes for the low and high bounds of crude oil price and thus is not ﬂexible. To
address this issue, we propose the interval dummy variables in accordance with the ACIX methodology to measure
the impact of the events of interest on crude oil prices. Our empirical results show that the relationships between
speculation and crude oil prices are not statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero in the short run, but signiﬁcant in
the long run. Moreover, the European debt crisis has little impact on crude oil prices and it reduces the range of oil
prices, while the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis has larger impact on the low bound of crude oil prices and it enlarges the
range of crude oil prices. In addition, our estimated results are generally robust for test methods and diﬀerent choices
of Kernel K under the minimum DK -distance estimation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the construction of interval dummy
variables and their economic implications on the level and volatility of the interval stochastic process in ACIX model.
We add interval dummy variables into the ACIX model of crude oil prices proposed by Han et al. (2011), and give an
extension of point-valued dummy variables in the interval framework. Section 3 provides ACIX model of crude oil
prices with interval dummy variables and hypothesis tests of the interesting combinations of coeﬃcients . Section 4
describes the data and presents some basic analysis. Empirical results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.
2. ACIX Model with Interval Dummy Variables
Following Han et al. (2009a), Deﬁnition 2.1, we deﬁne the interval dummy variable for an event D as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. The interval dummy variable for an event D is a pair of interval-valued dummy variables denoted as
DL,t and DR,t , which is deﬁned as
DL,t =

[−1, 0], D has occurred at time t
; DR,t =
[ 0, 0], otherwise

[0, 1], D has occurred at time t
.
[0, 0], otherwise

(1)

To quantify the impact of crude oil prices on the forecasting interval, we apply the proposed interval dummy variables to ACIX(p, q, s) model. Suppose that there are N pairs of interval-valued dummy variables D1L,t , D1R,t , D2L,t ,
D2R,t , · · · , DNL,t , DNR,t corresponding to N events. Then the ACIX model with interval dummy variables is

[α0 − β0 /2, α0 + β0 /2] is the interval intercept; ut = [uLt , uRt ] is interval martingale diﬀerence sequence with respect
to the information set It−1 , that is, E(ut |It−1 ) = [0, 0] almost surely. Eq.(2) is an extension of the ACIX model with
interval dummy variables which are used to measure the event impact.
To elaborate the economic signiﬁcance, we consider a simple case of Eq.(2) with one event D1 :

l=1

The interest here is to quantify the impact of the occurrence of event D1 on the interval process {Yt }. Denote Yt∗ =
[Lt∗ , R∗t ] as the forecasting interval produced from the ACIX model if D1L,t = D1R,t = [0, 0], i.e., event D1 has not
occurred at time t. It follows from Eq.(3) that the occurrence of D1 will induce Yt with interval arithmatics
Yt = Yt∗ + θ1L D1L,t + θ1R D1R,t = Yt∗ + [−θ1L , θ1R ],
and particularly the changes of the left and right bounds of forecasting interval Yt∗ due to the occurrence of D1 are
Lt = Lt∗ − θ1L and Rt = R∗t + θ1R .

(4)

It follows Eq.(4) that θ1L , the coeﬃcient of inter-valued dummy variable D1L,t , is the eﬀect brought to the left bound
by the event D1 . The left bound moves left at the length of θ1L when θ1L > 0, and moves right at the length of (−θ1L )
when θ1L < 0. θ1R , the coeﬃcient of inter-valued dummy variable D1R,t , is the eﬀect brought to the right bound by the
event D1 . If θ1R > 0, the right bound moves right at the length of θ1R ; If θ1R < 0, the right bound moves left at the
length of (−θ1R ).
Next, we consider the implication of the linear combination of the coeﬃcients, i.e., θ1R + θ1L , of the pair of
interval-valued dummy variables. Following the same reasoning as in Eq.(4), we have
Range (Yt ) = Range (Yt∗ ) + θ1R + θ1L .

(5)

Eq.(5) indicates that the range of forecasting interval is changed by the sum of coeﬃcients of inter-valued dummy
variables D1L,t and D1R,t . When θ1R + θ1L > 0 , i.e., the range of forecasting interval increases, which indicates that
the occurrence of D1 increases the volatility of the forecasting interval. When θ1R + θ1L < 0, i.e., the range of forecast
interval decreases, which indicates that the occurrence of D1 reduces the volatility of the interval-valued process.
Note that when θ1R + θ1L = 0, it indicates that the occurrence of D1 has no signiﬁcant impact on the volatility of the
interval-valued process.
To gain the insight with an economic perspective, we take the interval-valued crude oil prices Ft for example.
Applying the interval dummy variables to denote the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis, the forecasting interval of crude oil
prices is Ft = [Lt , Rt ] if the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis does not occur at time t, and it becomes [Lt − θ1L , Rt + θ1R ]
if the crisis occurs at time t. A likely situation would be θ1L > 0, θ1R < 0 and θ1R + θ1L > 0, with the economic
implications developed as follows. Eq.(4) implies that the right bound moves left at the length of (−θ1R ), and the left
bound moves left at the length of θ1L . It indicates that the overall level of crude oil prices has decreased as a result of
the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis. Furthermore, if θ1R +θ1L > 0, it follows from Eq.(5) that the range of forecasting interval
increases, that is, the volatility of the forecasting interval increases due to the occurrence of the sub-prime ﬁnancial
crisis. θ1R + θ1L is exactly the amount by which the range has increased, and it suggests another large volatility of
crude oil prices in the next month due to the impact of the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis, i.e., the volatility clustering of
the interval process {Yt }.
An alternative of the interval dummy variable corresponding to an event D1 can be deﬁned by a single intervalvalued dummy variable D1,t as
[−1, 1], D1 has occurred at time t
.
D1,t =
[ 0, 0], otherwise
Then the ACIX model considering only one event is

Denote Yt∗ = [Lt∗ , R∗t ] as the forecasting interval produced from the ACIX model if D1,t = [0, 0], i.e., event D1 has not
occurred at time t. It follows Eq.(6) that the occurrence of D1 will change the forecasting interval to
Yt = Yt∗ + θD1,t = Yt∗ + [−θ, θ],
and particularly, the changes of the left bounds, right bounds and ranges of the forecasting interval due to the occurrence of D1 are
(7)
Lt = Lt∗ − θ and Rt = R∗t + θ.
Range (Yt ) = Range (Yt∗ ) + 2θ.

(8)

It follows that the forecasting interval concerning the occurrence of event D1 is [Lt∗ − θ, R∗t + θ] . Eq.(7) and Eq.(8)
indicates that the change of the level of the forecasting interval is θ, which is the same for the left, right bound and
midpoint all the time, and the change of the range is 2θ. Although it is capable of quantifying the impact on the level
and range due to the occurrence of D1 , it is less ﬂexible and less convenient than using the pair as in Deﬁnition 1
above. The interval dummy variables in Eq.(6) cannot capture the changes when the intervals are not ’expanding’ or
’shortening’. Another thing is that, even either case happens, the length of price change of each side is not necessarily
the same.
3. ACIX Model of Crude Oil Prices with Interval Dummy Variables
3.1. Model Speciﬁcation
Based on the theory of interval dummy variables in section 2 and the crude oil prices forecasting model in Han et
al. (2011), we propose the ACIX model of crude oil prices with interval dummy variables, namely
ΔFt = α0 + β0 I0 + γ1 ECt−1 + γ2 ΔFt−1 + γ3 ΔS PEt−2 + γ4 D1L,t + γ5 D1H,t + γ6 D2L,t + γ7 D2H,t + ut ,

(9)

where I0 = [− 12 , 12 ] is a constant, unit interval; Ft = [Lt , Ht ]1 , is the interval-valued crude oil log price and Lt and Ht
represent the low and high oil log prices respectively; ΔFt = Ft − Ft−1 is the Hukuhara diﬀerence of the interval Ft
(see Han et al. (2009a), Deﬁnition 2.1); ECt = [− 12 V ECt , 12 V ECt ] is the interval-valued error correction term, where
V ECt is the cointegration between Ht and Lt ; S PEt = [S PELt , S PEHt ] is the interval-valued speculation; D1L,t and
D1H,t are the pair of interval-valued dummy variables that consists of the interval dummy variable D1 denoting the
event of the European debt crisis, and D2L,t and D2H,t are the pair interval-valued dummy variables that consists of
the interval dummy variable D2 denoting the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis; ut = [Lu,t , Hu,t ] is an interval martingale
diﬀerence sequence with respect to the information set It−1 , that is, E(ut |It−1 ) = [0, 0] a.s., α0 , β0 , γ j ( j = 1, 2, · · · , 7)
are scalar-valued population parameters.
Model (9) is an interval extension of the conventional point model of crude oil prices with point-valued dummy
variables, and it also includes past values of speculation. As shown in Section 5, the error correction term ECt is
also important for explaining the ﬂuctuations of crude oil prices in interval-valued framework. Thus, we construct a
reasonable interval for ECt of crude oil forecast model based on Han et al. (2011).
Since an interval can determine its low and high bounds, or its midpoint and range, two point-based models can be
derived from the ACIX model. For example, the induced point-based models for left and right bounds are expressed
as
1
1
ΔLt = α0 − β0 − γ1 ECt−1 + γ2 ΔLt−1 + γ3 ΔS PELt−2 − (γ4 + γ6 ) + Lu,t
(10)
2

(11)
ΔHt = α0 + β0 + γ1 ECt−1 + γ2 ΔHt−1 + γ3 ΔS PEHt−2 + (γ5 + γ7 ) + Hu,t

By interval calculation deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.1 in Han et al. (2009a), we can also obtain another group of point-based
models for midpoint and range.

order to be consistent with the actual oil prices description, we use this notation instead of Yt = [Lt , Rt ].

3.2. Hypothesis Testing
We employ the minimum DK -distance estimation methods for ACIX models in Han et al. (2009a). It follows that
the minimum DK -distance estimator of the parameter vector φ = (α0 , β0 , γ1 , γ2 , γ3 , γ4 , γ5 , γ6 , γ7 ) in Eq.(9) is
φˆ = arg min Qˆ T (φ),
φ∈Φ

where Qˆ T (φ) is the sum of squared norm of residuals of the ACIX model with interval dummy variables, namely

is the squared norm of the interval-valued residual in Eq.(9); K is any kernel to be positive semi-deﬁnite and symmetric, Zt (φ) = ([1, 1], I0 , ECt−1 , ΔFt−1 , ΔS PEt−2 , D1L,t , D1H,t , D2L,t , D2H,t ).

where uˆ t = ΔFt − Zt φ,
For a generic choice of kernel Kabc , it indicates that the minimum DK -distance estimator φˆ utilizes the correlation
between the range and midpoint, as well as both the range and midpoint information contained in the interval data.
Especially when a = c, the kernel Kab allows us to distribute relative importance between the midpoint and range.
It has been shown in Han et al. (2009a) that, when b/a = 1, the minimum DK -distance estimator φˆ boils down to
the range-based estimator; When b/a = −1, the minimum DK -distance estimator φˆ boils down to the midpoint-based
estimator; When b/a = 3/5, the minimum DK -distance estimator φˆ boils down to the bivariate (midpoint and range)based estimator. For other choices of b/a, when −1 < b/a < 3/5, the midpoint has a larger weight than the range;
when 3/5 < b/a < 1, the range has a larger weight than the midpoint. The minimum DK -distance estimation proposed
in Han et al.(2009a) is better in capturing richer information and delivering more eﬃcient estimators than point-based
methods.
ACIX model with interval dummy variables as in Eq.(9) captures the impact of the European debt crisis and the
sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on crude oil prices. The interest of the hypothesis tests on the coeﬃcients of interval dummy
variables is to examine whether the impact on the interval process {Yt } is statistically signiﬁcant. Following Eq.(4)
and Eq.(5), the coeﬃcients γ4 , γ5 , γ6 , γ7 measure the impact of the European debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial
crisis on the low and high bounds of crude oil prices, and the combinations γ4 + γ5 and γ6 + γ7 measure the impact
of the European debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on the range between low and high crude oil prices. If
γ4 , γ5 , γ6 , γ7 are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, it indicates that the European debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial
crisis have signiﬁcant impact on the low and high crude oil prices. On the other hand, if γ4 +γ5 is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero, there is a change in the range of crude oil prices. Assuming that γ4 + γ5 > 0, it follows Eq.(5) that the
range of the interval-valued crude oil prices Yt increases, and the monthly crude oil prices have larger volatility and
risk due to the impact of the European debt crisis. γ4 + γ5 is exactly the amount by which the range has increased. And
γ6 + γ7 has the similar situation for the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis. Therefore, what we will test could be summarized
as follows.

1278

Wei Yang et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1273 – 1282

Hypothesis 1 There is no impact of crisis on the low and high bounds of the interval crude oil prices, that is
H0 : γ4 = 0 and H0 : γ5 = 0, test the impact of the European debt crisis on the low and high crude oil prices.
H0 : γ6 = 0 and H0 : γ7 = 0, test the impact of the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on the low and high crude oil prices.
Hypothesis 2 There is no impact of crisis on the range of crude oil price, that is
H0 : γ4 + γ5 = 0, H1 : γ4 + γ5 < 0 for the European debt crisis.
H0 : γ6 + γ7 = 0, H1 : γ7 + γ6 > 0 for the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis.

According to Theorem 4.2 in Han et al (2009a), we also can construct the Wald hypothesis testing statistic W
based on the minimum DK -distance estimation, so we can construct the Wald parameter test based on the hypothesis:
H0 : Rφ0 = r. On the other hand, we are interested in testing the eﬀects of the European debt crisis and the sub-prime
ﬁnancial crisis on low and high bounds, range and midpoint of crude oil prices in interval-valued data framework, that
is, hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2.
4. Data Description And Preliminary Analysis
We employ the daily closing prices from Energy Information Administration to construct the monthly intervalvalued WTI crude oil future prices Ft = [Lt , Ht ]. That is, the minimum daily oil future price Lt and the maximum
daily oil future price Ht form a monthly interval-valued observation in a given month. The S PEt = [S PELt , S PEHt ]
data is from U.S. Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC). Minimum and Maximum weekly positions form a
monthly interval-valued observation in a given month. The point-valued speculation has been shown to be signiﬁcant
to explain the dynamics of crude oil prices in Kaufmann (2010), so we also consider interval-valued speculation in
ACIX model (9). The sample span of interval-valued data is from January 1993 to August 2011 and the daily prices
are transformed in log scale.

Figure 1: logs of lows, highs and ranges of the WIT crude oil future prices
Figure 1 shows the monthly log scales of the low price Lt , the high price Ht and the range between Lt and Ht , and
several observations emerge. Firstly, there are upward trends in both low and high bounds of crude oil prices from
January 1993 to August 2011. Secondly, the log scales of ranges between the low prices and high prices indicate
a moderate upward trends from January 1993 to July 2008 and then have a sharp bounce in the next few months.
Because we focus on the inﬂuences of sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis and the European debt crisis, we can see a sharp
decline during the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis and a moderate decline during the European debt crisis, which indicates
that the inﬂuences of the European debt crisis on crude oil prices is less than that of the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis.
Figure 1 also shows that the log scale of ranges are positive with many sporadic spikes, indicating that there are always
constant price ﬂuctuations in crude oil markets especially for the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis. The above observations
indicate the coeﬃcients γ4 and γ5 of D1L,t and D1H,t about the European debt crisis are not statistically signiﬁcant,
while the coeﬃcients γ6 and γ7 of D2L,t and D2H,t about the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis are statistically signiﬁcant. In
addition, the inﬂuences of the European debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on the range and midpoint is
of interest, and we expect γ4 + γ5 < 0 and γ6 + γ7 > 0, which indicate the ﬂuctuations of oil prices. Based on our

1279

Wei Yang et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1273 – 1282

research, we conﬁrm the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis dated from August 2008 when it has a comprehensive explosion
and the European debt crisis dated from December 2009 when Fitch downgraded Greece’s credit rating from A− to
BBB+ .
A summary of some characteristics of the variables used in Eq.(9) to construct the interval sample data shows
that the intra-month ﬂuctuations represented by the sample mean of monthly ranges are about 20 times higher than
the month-to-month changes in lows, highs and monthly average price level measured by the sample mean of ΔLt ,
ΔHt and ΔFAt . On the other hand, the dispersion of ranges is almost the same with the changes in lows, highs and
average prices levels. From the skewness and kurtosis, it is worth noting that the observations follow the distribution
characterized by peak and heavy tail.
Augmented Dickey-Fuller test results verify that Lt and Ht are stationary in the ﬁrst diﬀerences, but non-stationary
with the level magnitudes. Johansen’s trace and maximal eigenvalue, presented in Table 1. Past value of the error
correction term V ECt contains valuable information for future trends of crude oil prices.

5. Empirical Results
This section presents the estimation results of the ACIX model with interval dummy variables Eq.(9) to analyze
the inﬂuences of the European debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on crude oil prices. The whole sample
period during which we collect oil interval-valued data is from January 1993 to August 2011. In order to exclude
the impact of the southeast Asian ﬁnancial crisis as well as the 9.11 terrorist attacks (e.g. Hammoudeh, 2004; Tokic,
2010) on the interval-valued crude oil prices, the sample period we employ here is from January 2003 to August 2011.
For the purpose of investigating whether diﬀerent weights between the midpoint and range have diﬀerent estimated
1
2
5
results, the kernels we use in the minimum DK -distance estimation are of ba = ± 10
, ± 10
, · · · , ± 10
. Table 2 reports the
estimated results and P-values of the minimum DK -distance estimator. From table 2, it suggests that the intercepts α0
and β0 are signiﬁcant at 5% level. Past values of the three interval-valued explanatory variables ECt−1 , ΔFt−1 , and
ΔS PEt−2 are signiﬁcant at diﬀerent levels. ECt−1 is signiﬁcant at at 1% and ΔFt−1 is signiﬁcant at at 5%, whereas
ΔS PEt−2 is not statistically signiﬁcant. Han et al. (2011) shows that speculation has information in forecasting interval
crude oil prices in the long run, because speculators will charge a premium as a reward for accepting the futures price
risk which hedgers sought to transfer. However in the short run, in the context of the European debt crisis and the
sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis circumstance, speculation contains little information in forecasting the interval-valued crude
oil prices, because the coeﬃcients of interval dummy variables on crisis wipe out the risk premium. γ1 is negative,
because crude oil prices move towards an equilibrium level implied by highs and lows. Positive γ2 implies that a
negative ﬂuctuation between the changes in previous month tends to be vanished. For the hypothesis 1, the coeﬃcients
γ4 , γ5 and γ7 of interval-valued dummy variables are not signiﬁcant, and we have only γ6 to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero which shows the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis has signiﬁcant impact on the lower bound of crude oil prices.
Table 3 presents the P-values of hypothesis 2 under the minimum DK -distance estimation, with respect to diﬀerent
choices of kernel K. The ﬁrst row of Table 3 about Test 1, reports the testing results of the European debt crisis on
the range of crude oil prices, that is, the P-values of γ4 + γ5 = 0. It suggests that γ4 + γ5 is signiﬁcantly negative
which indicates the European debt crisis reduces the range of crude oil prices. The second row of Table 3 about Test
2, reports the test results of the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on the range of crude oil prices, that is, the P-values of
γ6 + γ7 = 0. It suggests that γ6 + γ7 is signiﬁcantly positive which indicates the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis increases
the range of oil prices, that is, the crude oil prices have larger volatility at this time. In addition, we also analyze the

signiﬁcance of estimated parameter in model (9) using T-test method, then achieve the similar conclusions. So our
empirical results are robust for T-test and Wald test methods.

Oil prices started rising in early 2002 and continued their dramatically climb from a low of 30 per barrel in 2002
to a high of around 140 by mid-2008. The primary reason of earlier oil prices increase would be that the production
of oil failed to increase and global demand has been growing steadily. However, as the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis
of 2007–2009 increased uncertainty and pushed the economy into a recession in December 2007, many countries
decreased their demand for oil and oil prices crashed. From 120 per barrel in mid-2008, the price rapidly crashed
back to be around 30 by the end of 2008. Therefore, there was an obvious shock on crude oil prices during the
sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis and the ranges between the lows and highs increased sharply. At the beginning of the year

1281

2009, every country has taken measures to get out of the ﬁnancial crisis fast and have an economic recovery, so the oil
demand picked up gradually. But the European debt crisis slowed down the increase and reduced the ranges between
the lows and highs. All of these are consistent with the estimated coeﬃcients of interval dummy variables. That
the coeﬃcients of interval-valued dummy variables about the European debt crisis are not signiﬁcant maybe due to
the short time period since the occurrence of the European debt crisis and people’s cautious psychology to crude oil
markets.

We also used the class of kernel K taking the form of Kabc (see Han et al. (2009a) Section 5) in the minimum DK distance estimation for Eq.(9), and various kernels have been tested. The results show that there is little diﬀerence of
the estimated parameters and the corresponding p-values by using Kab and Kabc , so we can assume a = c for simplicity.
In fact, the simulation results in Han et al. (2009a) have showed that the use of Kabc utilizes more information from
the interval data and produces more eﬃcient estimated results for parameters, which displays robust performance for
various kernels under the minimum DK -distance estimation. Of course, the minimum DK -distance estimation results
induced from Kabc are available on requirement.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we propose interval dummy variable in ACIX model in order to study the inﬂuences of the European
debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis on crude oil prices in a uniﬁed interval framework. The ACIX model of
crude oil prices with interval dummy variable is an interval extension of the conventional point model of oil prices,
and the coeﬃcients of the interval dummy variable can describe the change of the low and high crude oil prices
caused by the crisis. Especially, the linear combinations of coeﬃcients can also capture the impact on the level and
range of crude oil prices. In addition, based on the asymptotic normal theory of the minimum DK -distance estimator,
we construct hypothesis tests to examine whether the European debt crisis and the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis have
signiﬁcant impact on the crude oil prices and its volatility.
The empirical results show that the relationships between speculation and crude oil prices have diﬀerent statistical
signiﬁcance between the short run and the long run. Moreover, the European debt crisis has little impact on crude
oil prices and it reduces the range of crude oil prices, while the sub-prime ﬁnancial crisis has larger impact on the
lower bound of crude oil prices and it enlarges the volatility of crude oil prices. In addition, our estimated results are
robust for diﬀerent test methods and diﬀerent choices of Kernel K under the minimum DK -distance estimation. The
analysis results may help market participants in making eﬀective investment decisions and formulating appropriate
risk management strategies.
