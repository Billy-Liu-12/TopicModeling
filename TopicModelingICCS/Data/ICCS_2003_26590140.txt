Abstract. Analyzing protein-RNA binding structures depends on a significant
quantity of manual work. Therefore, the protein-RNA binding structures are
generally studied individually or on a small-scale. The task of analyzing the
protein-RNA binding structures manually becomes increasingly difficult as the
complexity and number of protein-RNA binding structures increase. We have
developed a set of algorithms for automatically analyzing the structures of the
protein-RNA complexes at an atomic level and for identifying the interaction
patterns between the protein and RNA. The algorithms were implemented and
tested on the actual structure data of 51 protein-RNA complexes. It is believed
that this is the first structural analysis of a large set of protein-RNA complexes.
The results of the analysis will provide insight into the interaction patterns between a protein and RNA, and will be useful in predicting the structure of the
RNA binding protein and the structure of the protein binding RNA.

1 Introduction
Identifying how a protein molecule binds an RNA molecule with an affinity and specificity is a complex problem involving both spatial reasoning and an extensive knowledge of biochemistry. Individual or a small set of protein-RNA binding structures can
be analyzed manually. However, as the number of protein-RNA complexes available
in public databases is rapidly increasing a more systematic and automated method will
be needed.
In contrast to the regular helical structure of DNA, RNA molecules form complex
secondary and tertiary structures consisting of several structure elements, including
stems, loops, and pseudoknots. Often, only specific proteins can recognize the structure elements arranged three-dimensional space. RNA structures display hydrogen
bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic groups that can interact with small molecules
to form specific contacts. However, it is unclear how the proteins interact with the
RNA with specificity.
This paper presents a computational approach to analyze the interactions between
the amino acids of a protein and the RNA nucleotides at the atomic level. The primary

focus of the work was to discover the conspicuous preferences in the pairing of amino
acids with nucleotides. We have developed a set of algorithms for analyzing the protein-RNA binding structures and tested the algorithms on 51 protein-RNA complexes
obtained from the PDB database [4]. The computational analysis attempted to address
the following problems: (1) the hydrogen bonding propensity between the amino acids
and the nucleotides, (2) the preferences between the main and side protein chains in
the binding sites, and (3) the preferences between the base and RNA backbone in the
binding sites.

2 Terminology and Notation
2.1 The Amino Acids: Main Chain, Side Chain
Proteins are sequences of up to 20 types of amino acids. Each amino acid contains the
main chain of repeating units and one of 20 different "R" groups. It is the structure of
the R group that determines the amino acid type. The “R” groups are referred to as the
side chain and the other parts are called the main chain [1].
2.2 The Nucleic Acids: Base, Backbone, Base Pair, Base Step
Nucleic acids are sequences of nucleotides. A nucleotide consists of three parts: a
five-carbon sugar, a nitrogen-containing ring structure called a base, and one, two, or
three phosphate groups. Sugar and phosphorus are referred to as the backbone [1].
2.3 The Interactions: Single, Bidentate and Complex Interaction
As shown in Fig. 1, an interaction with one hydrogen bond between an amino acid and
a nucleotide is called single interaction. An interaction with two or more hydrogen
bonds with either a nucleotide or base paired nucleotides is known as a bidentate interaction. An interaction where an amino acid binds to more than one base step simultaneously is called a complex interaction. Our definition of the interactions is slightly
different from Luscombe’s definition [2]. Luscombe’s definition considers the binding
with the base part only, but we also consider the binding with the backbone part (that
is, the sugar and phosphorus) [2]. Therefore, this study can show the difference in the
binding propensities between the base, sugar and phosphorus.
2.4 The Hydrogen Bonds: Donor, Acceptor
A hydrogen bond is formed by three atoms: one hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms (often N or O). The hydrogen atom is covalently bound to one of the electronegative atoms, and is called a hydrogen bond donor. The other electronegative
atom is known as the hydrogen bond acceptor. The two electronegative atoms may
take up some of the electron density from the hydrogen atom. As a result, each electronegative atom carries partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom carries a partial positive charge. Consequently, the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen bond acceptor
can then have attractive interactions. The strength of the hydrogen bond depends on
the donor and acceptor as well as their environment. The bond energy usually ranges
from 1 to 5 kcal/mol. This energy is smaller than the covalent bond energy, but greater
than the thermal energy (0.6 kcal/mol at room temperature). Therefore, a hydrogen
bond can provide a significant stabilizing force in macromolecules such as proteins
and nucleic acids [3].

3 Framework for Analyzing Protein-RNA Binding Structures
3.1 Dataset
The protein-RNA complex structures were obtained from the PDB database [4]. The
complexes, which were determined by X-ray crystallography with a resolution ≥ 3.0Ǻ,
were selected. As of September 2002, there were 188 protein-RNA complexes in PDB
and the number of complexes with a resolution of 3.0 Ǻ or better is 139. We used PSIBLAST [5] for a similarity search on each of the protein and RNA sequences in these
139 protein-RNA complexes in order to eliminate the equivalent amino acids or nucleotides in homologous protein or RNA structures. 64 out of 139 protein-RNA complexes were left as the representative, non-homologous complexes after running the
PSI-BLAST program with an E value of 0.001 and an identity value of 80% or below.
We excluded 13 out of the 64 complexes that have no information of water molecules
or are composed of artificial nucleotides. Therefore, the final data set was composed
of 51 protein-RNA complexes. Table 1 shows the list of 51 protein-RNA complexes
studied in our analysis.

3.2 Hydrogen Bonds
The number of hydrogen bonds between the amino acids and nucleotides in the protein-RNA complexes was calculated using CLEAN, which is a program used for tidying Brookhaven files, and HBPLUS [6], which is a program to calculate the number of
hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds were identified by finding all proximal atom
pairs that satisfy the given geometric criteria between the hydrogen bond donors (D)
and acceptors (A). The positions of the hydrogen atoms (H) were theoretically inferred from the surrounding atoms, because hydrogen atoms are invisible in purely Xray-derived structures. The criteria considered to form the hydrogen bonds for this
study are: contacts with a maximum D-A distance of 3.9 Å, maximum H-A distance of
2.5 Å, and a minimum D-H-A angle and H-A-AA angle set to 90°, where AA is an
acceptor antecedent.
All the hydrogen bonds were extracted from the HBPLUS output files. There were
1568 hydrogen bonds in the dataset. In order to compare the properties of a single
interaction, a bidentate interaction and a complex interaction, separate experiments
were conducted and the results were analyzed for the three classes of protein-RNA
complexes: (1) single interaction, (2) bidentate interaction and (3) complex interaction.
Figure 2 shows the sequence of classifying the three interaction types.

4 Algorithms
This section describes the seven algorithms, which were performed in sequence on the
data shown in Fig. 2. The terminologies used in the algorithms are explained in Sect. 2.

Fig. 2. Sequence of classifying three interaction types. The operation within a box labeled by
an algorithm is explained in section 4. HBPLUS is explained in section 3.2.

Algorithm 1 constructs the PRO-SEQ and RNA-SEQ arrays to store the amino acid
and RNA sequences, respectively. Algorithm 2 classifies hydrogen bonds into a P-RList (list of hydrogen bonds between the protein and RNA) and R-R-List (list of hydrogen bonds between RNA and RNA). Algorithm 3 investigates the internal hydrogen bond relations of the RNA and marks the result of the investigation in a linked-list.
Algorithm 4 investigates the hydrogen bonds between the protein and RNA and marks
the result of the investigation in a linked-list. Algorithm 5 analyzes whether a nucleotide is paired with another nucleotide. It returns true if the nucleotide is paired. Algorithm 6 classifies the type of each amino acid into unary, binary and multi-bond based
on the number of hydrogen bonds between the amino acid and the RNA. It calls
Get_Max_Distance() to calculate the distance between a nucleotide and its binding
amino acid. Algorithm 7 classifies the protein-RNA interaction types into three categories. The three categories are single interactions, bidentate interactions and complex
interactions, as was explained in Sect. 2.

5 Results and Discussion
The protein-RNA interactions were computed for the 51 complexes. All interactions
that occur repeatedly in the structurally related complexes were removed from the
dataset in order to exclude any bias towards the proteins with multiple PDB entries.
This filtering process resulted in a dataset of 1568 hydrogen bonds, which were the
subject of this analysis.

5.1 Amino Acids
Among the three interaction types, single interactions are the most abundant, as
shown in Table 2. Amino acids involved in the bidentate interactions predominantly
interact with bases. Table 3 shows the ranking of bindings of the amino acids with
nucleotides in each interaction type. The dominant bindings are shown in bold style.
For example, PHE-G S in the bold style denotes that PHE binds mainly to the sugar
part of guanine but not to the other parts. No hydrophobic residues were found in the
complex interactions. In particular, ALA, MET, PRO and VAL were found in single
interactions only.

Fig. 4. The total number of hydrogen bonds of each nucleotide, involved in the bidentate interactions with amino acids

The number of hydrogen bonds in the amino acids is as follows. ARG (306), LYS
(257), SER (164), THR (151), GLU (136), ASN (125), ASP (116), GLN (61), TYR
(59) and GLY (40). But the ordering changes when the hydrogen bonds are classified
based on whether they are found in the base, sugar or phosphorus of a nucleotide.
LYS and THR frequently participate in the bonds with a base but not with sugar. In
contrast, ARG and SER frequently participate in bonding with the backbone but not
with the base. THR showed a significant dissimilarity from SER. THR is 2nd most
common in binding to a base but the 10th in binding to a sugar. In contrast, SER is the
7th most common in binding to a base but 2nd in binding to a sugar. Fig. 3 shows the
number of hydrogen bonds of each amino acid, involved in the bidentate interactions.
From an atomic point of view, the LYS NH binds to the phosphorus of the nucleotides 87 times and is the most frequent participator. Next are the ARG NH2phosphorus and the THR O-base, which bind 58 times. The order of the others is as

Computational Approach to Structural Analysis of Protein-RNA Complexes

follows: ASP OD1-base (55 times), GLU OE2-base (51), SER OG-sugar (51), LYS
NZ-base (49), SER OG-base (49), ARG NH2-base (45) and GLU OE1-base (45).
This study made two interesting observations. The first observation was that 82 LYS
NZ-phosphorus bonds out of a total 87 were observed in the single interactions. However, the THR OG1-base bond participates mainly in bidentate interactions. The second observation was that even though the THR O and OG1 consist of the same amino
acids and bind to the same nucleotide part, this study found that the O is mainly involved in single interactions and the OG1 is involved in the bidentate interactions.
This is partly, but not entirely, due to the difference in the side chain and the main
chain. Both the THR OG1 and OG2 are located in the amino acid side chain. However,
OG2 never binds while OG1 binds 46 times. Different amino acids showed different
binding propensities depending on the interaction types. GLU and HIS participate
mainly in bidentate interactions. In particular, GLU binds to a base frequently because
GLU OE1 and OE2 have a strong binding propensity.
5.2 Nucleotide
On average, hydrogen bonds prefer the bases (49%) than the sugar (28%) and phosphorus (23%) of a nucleotide, but there is little difference in preference between the
bases and the backbone (Table 2). The specific binding propensities change according
to interaction types. In bidentate interactions, the hydrogen-bonding rate of the base
increases to 60% and that of phosphorus decreases to 10%. In contrast, in complex
interactions, the hydrogen-bonding rate of the base decreases to 20% and that of
phosphorus increases to 44%. This difference can be explained by the structure. In
complex interactions, an amino acid binds to at least two base pairs, which is a stem.
Thus, an amino acid held within a stem has a great chance to bind to the backbone.
All the nucleotides bind frequently to ARG and LYS. However, guanine binds predominantly with GLU and ASP, which have an acidic side chain group, and adenine
binds frequently to THR. This is because GLU OE1, OE2 and THR OG1 bind preferentially to the base in bidentate interactions. Figure 4 shows the number of hydrogen
bonds of each nucleotide, which are involved in bidentate interactions.

6 Conclusion
Structural analysis of the protein-RNA complexes is labor-intensive yet it provides
insight into the interaction patterns between a protein and RNA. The protein-RNA
binding structures are studied either individually or on a small-scale. However, manual analysis of the protein-RNA binding structures is becoming increasingly challenging as the complexity and number of protein-RNA complexes increase. This study
developed a set of algorithms for automatically analyzing the hydrogen bonds in the
protein-RNA binding structures and for identifying the interaction patterns between a
protein and RNA. The algorithms were used for analyzing 1568 hydrogen bonds in 51
protein-RNA complexes, which are the most representative set of protein-RNA complexes known today. This is the first computational approach for analyzing the structures of a large set of protein-RNA complexes. The interaction patterns discovered

from this analysis will assist in the understanding of how proteins interact with RNA
with specificity and to predict the structure of the RNA binding protein as well as the
structure of the protein binding RNA.
