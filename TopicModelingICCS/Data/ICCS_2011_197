Abstract
This paper presents an Agent-Based modeling and simulation to design a decision support system (DSS) for the
operation of Healthcare Emergency Departments (ED). This DSS aims to aid EDs managers in setting up strategies
and management guidelines to optimize the operation of EDs. This ongoing research is being performed by the
Research Group on Individual Oriented Modeling (IoM) of CAOS in the University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB)
in close collaboration with Hospital ED Staﬀ. The simulation main objective is to optimize the performance of such
complex and dynamic Healthcare ED. Optimization is performed to ﬁnd the optimal ED staﬀ conﬁguration, which
consists of doctors, triage nurses, and admission personnel, i.e. a multidimensional problem. Two diﬀerent indexes,
to minimize patient waiting time, and to maximize patient throughput, were proposed and tested and their results
obtained appying an exhaustive search technique, yield promising results and better understanding of the problem.

1. Introduction
At the present time, healthcare systems have become large, complex, and very dynamic environments, particularly
Emergency Department (ED). ED is a sui generis unit of hospitals. It is open and functioning 24 hours a day, 365
days per year. Typically, ED patients could arrive by walking, or by ambulance, and they undergo a triage, which
determine the acuity of their condition assigning them a priority level. Patients with threatening disease, i.e. high
priority level, are treated almost immediatly by a physician compared to those patients with less severe injuries. Then,
an initial diagnosis and treatment is proposed, and patients could be admitted into the service or discharged. EDs have
high demand of service, which increases their cost, and they generally operate with limited healthcare resources and
budget. In the decade leading up to 2006 in the USA, ED visits (patients) have increased by 32%, whereas the number
of EDs have decreased by 4.6%, and the number of visits per person increased by 18% [1]. Also, in Spain between

2001 and 2007, the visits to EDs have increased by 23.2% [2]. Over half of those visits to EDs are nonurgent and could
be treated in alternative healthcare settings. Overcrowding of EDs is a worldwide problem, and as a consequence of
such situation, waiting time increases, aﬀecting quality and speed of care [3]. Despite EDs are under those huge, and
growing demands they suﬀer several budget cuts. Nevertheless, such critical ED service must be satisﬁed with the best
quality as quickly as possible. An obvious solution to this problem is to increase the capacity of EDs. Such capacity
is limited by the size of the healthcare facility and the available staﬀ, which includes physicians, nurses, admissions,
and services personnel. However, such straightforward solution is not the best approach, and could be unrealizable.
Healthcare system heads must maximize, for example, the use of healthcare resources, in order to minimize patient
waiting time and increase patient satisfaction, whereas being constrained by limited budget.
This paper presents the results of an ongoing research project that is being carried out by the Research Group in
Individual Oriented Modeling (IoM) in the University Autonoma of Barcelona (UAB), with the participation of the
ED head team of the Hospital of Sabadell in Catalu˜na, Spain. The general objective of the project is to develop a
simulator of ED’s operation that, used as a decision support system (DSS), could help the heads of EDs to set up
strategies, and management guidelines to enhance the performance of such EDs. As a ﬁrst step to towards this goal,
the main objective of this work is to propose a simple but realistic simulation model to represent the operation of EDs,
in order to study their optimum performance under certain operational and economical conditions. The mathematical
formalism of the latter is a multidimensional optimization problem which can be stated by equation (1):
max / min
subject to

f (X)
x∈C

(1)

where f : C → R, and f (X) at any X ∈ C cannot be evaluated exactly, and must be estimated via a simulation
procedure by assuming that X is discrete, global sampling from X is possible. The goal is to identify the staﬀ
members of EDs that optimize its performance, taking into account the complexity of EDs and their optimum expected
performance needs to be estimated via simulations. However, optimization via simulation is a diﬃcult problem [4],
as simulations are usually computationally expensive, i.e. even estimating f (X) at a single point X ∈ C in equation
(1) may require substantial eﬀort. Consequently, only few alternatives can be explored.
Herewith, the ED is modeled by an Agent-Based Model (ABM), in which all rules within the model concern the
involved agents (in our case the doctors, triage nurses and admission personnel, and the patients), no higher level
behavior is modeled. The system behavior emerges as a result of local level actions and interactions [5]. This model
describes the complex dynamics found in an ED, representing each individual and system as an individual agent. Two
distinct kinds of agents have been identiﬁed, active and passive. Active agents represent the individuals involved in the
ED, in this case all human actors, such as patients and ED staﬀ (admission staﬀ, nurses, doctors, etc). Passive agents
represent services and other reactive systems, such as the information technology (IT) infrastructure or services used
for performing tests. State machines are used to represent the actions of each agent. This takes into consideration
all the variables that are required to represent the many diﬀerent states that such individual (a patient, a member of
hospital staﬀ, or any other role in the EDs) may be in throughout the course of their time in a hospital emergency
department. The change in time of these variables, invoked by an input from an external source, is modeled as a
transition between states. The communication between individuals is modeled as the inputs that agents receive and the
outputs they produce, both implicitly and explicitly. In order to control the agent interaction, the physical environment
in which these agents interact also has to be modeled, being suﬃcient to do it as a series of interconnected areas, such
as admissions, triage box, the waiting room, and consultation suits.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows; section 2 describes the related works. The proposed emergency
department model is detailed in section 3, while the results of initial simulation optimizations are given in section 4.
Finally, in section 5 the conclusions and future work are presented.
2. Related works
The interest on simulating healthcare systems is not new, in 1979 computer simulations were applied to hospital
systems to improve the scheduling of staﬀ members [6], and in another simulation [7] the aim was to quantify the
impact that the number of staﬀ members, and beds had on patient throughput time. Moreover, a survey of discreteevent simulation (DES) in healthcare clinics was presented in [8].

1882

Although discrete-event simulation is widely used in simulating healthcare systems, agent technology is a good
option in healthcare applications, since it is better to characterize the operation of complex systems as the EDs are.
ABM can explicitly model the complexity arising from individual interactions that arise in the real world. Agentbased simulation allows people to model their real-world systems in ways that either not possible or not readily
accomodated using taditional modeling techniques, such as DES or system dynamics [9]. Previous works modeling
healthcare systems have focused on patient scheduling under variable pathways and stochastic process durations, the
selection of an optimal mix of patient admission to optimize the use of resources and patient throughput [10]. Work
has been performed to evaluate patient waiting times under diﬀerent ED physician schedules, but only one utilized
real data [11] and another one patient diversion strategies [12], both using diﬀerent degrees of agent-based modeling.
There is a relevant article which uses ABM to simulate the workﬂow in ED [13]. It focus on triage and radiology
process, but not real data was used, the acuity of patients are not consider, and healthcare providers do not always
serve patients in a ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve basis.
Simulation optimization is used to improve the operation of ED in [14], using a commercial simulation package,
and in [15] the authors combine simulation with optimization, which involves a complex stochastic objective function
under a deterministic and stochastic set of restrictions.
Finally, an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach is used for dynamic allocation of resources in hospital practice [16], while in [17] the authors found that agent-based approaches and classical optimization techniques
complement each other.
As stated above, this proposal addresses many of the issues surrounding the modeling and simulation of a healthcare emergency department using the agent-based paradigm, where the eﬃciency of agents in this area has not been
totally explored yet. Basic rules governing the actions of the individual agents are deﬁned, in an attempt to understand
micro level behavior. The macro level behavior, that of the system as a whole, emerges as a result of the actions of
these basic building blocks, from which an understanding of the reasons for system level behavior can be derived [18].
3. Emergency department model
As mentioned above, the Emergency Department model deﬁned in this work is a pure Agent-Based Model, formed
entirely of the rules governing the behavior of the individual agents which populate the system. Through the information obtained during interviews carried out with ED staﬀ at the Hospital of Sabadell, two kinds of agents have been
identiﬁed; these are active and passive agents. The active agents represent people and other entities that act upon
their own initiative: patients, admission staﬀ, sanitarian technicians, triage and emergency nurses, and doctors. The
passive agents represent systems that are solely reactive, such as the loudspeaker system, patient information system,
pneumatic pipes, and central diagnostic services (radiology service and laboratories). This section is dedicated to
describe the various components of the general model succinctly. Section 3.1 explains the manner in which active
agents are modeled. Passive agents are discussed in section 3.2. The communication model is deﬁned in section 3.3.
Finally, in section 3.4 the details of the environment where the agents move and interact are outlined.
3.1. Active agents
Active agents are described by state machines, speciﬁcally Moore machines. A Moore machine has an output for
each state; transitions between states are speciﬁed by the input. Considering this, the current state of an active agent
is represented by a collection of state variables, known as the state vector (T). Each unique combination of values for
these variables deﬁnes a distinct state. As described below, in each time step the state machine moves to the next state
as deﬁned by the current state and the input vector.
3.1.1. State variables
In order for the state machine to work, all state variables must be enumerable in some manner. These may be discrete variables or variables representing continuous quantities which have been divided into ranges. An initial set of
state variables has been deﬁned through the round of interviews performed, based on the minimum amount of information required to model each patient and member of staﬀ. Such initial set of state variables includes: Name/Identiﬁer,
Personal details, Location, Action, Physical condition, Symptoms, Communication skills and Level of experience
(ED staﬀ only). Some of these state variables will have a variable and potentially very large set of possible values,
e.g. the symptoms or physical condition.

3.1.2. Inputs, outputs & probabilistic state transitions
Upon each time step the state machine moves to the next state. This may be a new state or the same one it was
before the transition, as shown schematically in Figure 1. The state machine involves probabilistic transitions, where
a given combination of current state and input have more than one possible next state. Which transition is made is
chosen at random at the time of the transition, weights on each transition provide the means to specify transitions that
are more or less likely for a given individual. The input is more accurately described as an input vector (I) containing
a number of input variables, each one capable of taking several diﬀerent values with a certain probability. As this is a
Moore machine, the output depends only on the state, so each state has it’s own output, although various states may
have outputs that are identical. Again, the output is more accurately described as an output vector (O), a collection of
output variables, each with a number of deﬁned possible values. Our state transition table is deﬁned with probabilities
on the input as shown in Figure 1b. An agent in state S x receiving an input Ia may move to either one ofthe states
Sy , Sz or remain in the same state, with a probability of p1 , p2 , and p3 , respectively. One of these transitions will
always occur, which is to say p1 + p2 + p3 = 1. The state diagram would then have three diﬀerent transitions for that
state-input combination as shown in Figure 1a.

(a) Probabilistic state transition graph

(b) Probabilistic state transition table

Figure 1: Probabilistic state transition graph and its corresponding table. I and O represents input and output vector,
respectively, while Si are the diﬀerent states, and pi is a certain probability.
The exact probabilities may be diﬀerent for each agent, in this way agent behavior can be probabilistically deﬁned
external to their state, representing personality characteristics in diﬀerent people.
3.2. Passive agents
Passive agents represent services within the hospital system such as the IT infrastructure, radiology services, and
other laboratory tests as well as speciﬁc systems such as the pneumatic tube networks that some larger hospitals use to
quickly transfer samples from one part of the building to another one. In some of the passive agents the state machine
will be a simple system that interacts with active agents. The model is not, however, purely a state machine. In order
to represent data storage or other systems that may have a very large number of combinational states a simple memory
model will be used. A passive agent may have (although it is not necessary) a simple record based memory system,
allowing it to store and repeat information provided by active agents.
3.3. Communication model
The interaction between agents is carried out through communication. Such communication is modeled as the
input that agents receive and the outputs that they produce. Both, inputs and outputs may be explicit and implicit.
The communication model represents three basic types of communication: 1) 1-to-1, between two individuals (the
message has a single source and a single destination); 2) 1-to-n, representing an individual addressing to a group
(like a doctor giving information to patient and nurses during the diagnostic process); and 3) 1-to-location, when an
individual speaks to all occupants of a speciﬁc area (for instance when any staﬀ member uses the loudspeaker system
to broadcast a message to all the people who are in a speciﬁc waiting room). Implicit or passive communication also
exists, where an agent may be communicating just by remaining in a certain area. This is the manner in which agent

1884

Eduardo Cabrera et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1880–1889

vision, what each agent sees, can be represented using the same model. An agent is continuously emitting messages
with regard to its visible physical status and location, other agents receive these 1-to-location messages and may act
upon them in certain circumstances. Messages are divided in three parts. The message source is the individual who
is communicating. The message destination would then be to whomever this individual is speaking to, and thirdly the
content, what is being said. These three parts make up the message tuple (<src>, <dst>, <content>). In the case
of a 1-to-location message, the destination of the message is an entire location, so the content may need to include
the actual indented recipient of the message. This could represent a patient’s name being called over the loudspeaker
system.
3.4. Environment
All actions and interactions modeled take place within certain locations, collectively known as the environment.
The environment itself can be deﬁned in two diﬀerent levels depending on the positional precision required by the
model: at a low or high granularity scale. The former implies to divide the space into a few general areas, where all
agents in the same area may freely interact. The second requires more precise positioning, using physical Cartesian
coordinates. In the speciﬁc case of the Emergency Department it is enough to use a low granularity positioning
scale, although it is important to represent distances between distinct areas, to correctly model travel times form one
area to another. The diﬀerent areas identiﬁed through the information obtained during the interviews carried out are:
Admissions, Triage Box, Waiting Room, diagnostic and treatment zone.
The environment in which the agents move and interact is passive and discrete. There is little distinction made
between agents in the same location. A patient in the waiting room does not have any more speciﬁc sense of position
than they are in the waiting room. Certain locations may be physically distinct, but functionally identical, for instance
there are usually a number of triage rooms, an agent in any one of these will act as if they are in any triage room,
however the simpliﬁed ED layouts are distinct in order to represent that each available room may only be used by
one nurse-patient group at a time. The environment also contains representations of the relative distances between
diﬀerent discrete locations.
4. Optimization
4.1. Problem description
The simulator for this work is used as a black box as described below, includes simple realistic descriptors of the
ED’s: agents, basic physical infrastructure, and operating practices. Nevertheless the more realistic the simulator is,
the better results and optimizations are. It is implemented by the agent-based simulation environment NetLogo [19],
which is well suited for modeling complex systems such as the EDs. For simplicity, only four diﬀerent types of active
agents are considered: admission staﬀ (A), nurses (N), doctors (D), and patients. The ED staﬀ have two kinds of
expertise: low and high, labeled as junior, and senior, respectively. Junior staﬀ will require more time to accomplish
their tasks than seniors, which cost-wise are more expensive (see Table 1).
The initial scenario adopted for the experiments is to simulate patients moving through a simpliﬁed ED physical
infrastructure that includes four primary areas: admissions, triage (up to three boxes), two waiting rooms (one for
patients before triage, and the other for patients who have passed the triage process, and are waiting for treatment),
and the diagnosis and treatment area (four boxes). The following basic patient attributes were assumed. Patients arrive
to the ED by their own, and wait to be attended in the admission area. Then, patients stay in the ﬁrst Waiting Room
(WR1), until a triage nurse call them. After the triage process patients pass to a second waiting room (WR2), and
stay there until an available doctor calls them to start the diagnosis, and to prescribe a treatment (which might include
laboratory tests) depending on the patient’s symptoms, and physical condition. Finally, patients are discharged from
the ED. Such simpliﬁed ED layout is shown in Figure 2. Although realistic treatment is based on the acuity of patients,
in this initial simulation patients we assumed that patients have the same path throughout the ED. In this experiment a
constant pattern of patients arrival pattern has been assumed, since we would like ﬁrst to work with a simpler model.
Also it will be assumed that patients arrive to the ED after a certain time step, and with four diﬀerent patients arrival
probabilities (P) 20, 40, 60, and 80%. Those probability values are used to emulate the randomness of the incoming
patients to the ED.

The multidimensional optimization problem considered in this paper aims to ﬁnd the optimal ED staﬀ conﬁguration under certain operational constrains (the optimal solution will correspond to the minimum value of an index
which is deﬁned furtherdown in the application experiments). The dimension of the problem corresponds to: the
types and number of ED staﬀ considered, i.e. doctors (D), triage nurses (N), and admissions personnel (A), which
could be, as stated above, junior or senior; the working time units considered for each of them, their associated cost
units. The assumed values of each of those are shown in the Table 1. This represents a combinatorial or multidimensional problem (where each variable or in this case ED staﬀ member represents one dimension plus the patients
arrival, i.e. the input to the ED). Such combinatorial problem is shown in Table 2 for doctors -14 cases- (nurses and
admission personnel have similar combinations -9 cases for each of them). Taking this into account speciﬁc scenarios
or conﬁgurations have to be simulated several times, changing parameters to show the eﬀect of considering diﬀerent
probabilities of the patients arrival time, this strategy will allow us to generate set of results from which particular
eﬀects can be analized.

Even with this simple setting of an ED the search space is large, i.e. the search space has 4,536 (which results
of assuming a combination of two types -junior or senior- of up to 4 doctors, 3 nurses, 3 admissions, and 4 diﬀerent
probabilities of patients arrival, i.e. 14 × 9 × 9 × 4) combinations from which the optimal combination that minimizes
the desire index, under some restrictions, will be obtained. In the experiments shown in sections 4.2 and 4.3 the
period simulated of the ED operation was of 24 hrs. (which represent 25,000 ticks -NetLogo’s time step- for all the
experiments, and an average input of 400 patients, which is the average incoming patients that the heads of ED of the
Hospital of Sabadell have reported).
Two diﬀerent indexes were set in order to evaluate the utility of the Agent-Based ED simulator for optimizing
the resources. Exhaustive search technique was used to obtain the optimum in the experiments reported in sections
4.2 and 4.3. All simulations were done using the simulator described previously, using the NetLogo’s BehaviorSpace
tool, serially and using an IBM cluster, which has 32 compute nodes with 2 x Dual-Core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 5160

4.2. First experiment
The ﬁrst index aimed to minimize patient waiting time in the ED, with cost conﬁguration less or equal to 3,500 e.
Thus, the ﬁrst index is expressed mathematically in equation (2).

The results are shown in Figures 3 and 4; where the circle points are the staﬀ conﬁgurations that satisfy the
restriction, while the triangle points are the minimum for each diﬀerent case of probability, 20% and 40%, respectively.
The minimal conﬁgurations are presented in Figures 3c, 3d, 4c, and 4d, as well as their costs.
In Figures 3a and 3c, there are three diﬀerent staﬀ conﬁgurations that have the minimum average waiting time, but
with diﬀerent costs. Also, in the same Figure 3a, it can be appreciated that there are many other staﬀ conﬁgurations
that are quite close to the minimum time, but less expensive.
In the other cases, where the probability P of patients arrival increases, i.e. has higher probability of patients
arrival, there are only few staﬀ conﬁgurations around the minimum, or clearly only one. Not only does the patients
arrival increase, but also the minimum average patient waiting time (wt), as expected, as well as the cost of the staﬀ
conﬁguration, and also the standard deviation σwt of the average patient waiting time are shown in Table 3. The
number of patients increases at waiting rooms, both WR1 and WR2 ( shown in Figure 2) at times t1, t2, t3, and t4
(each time represents every 7,500 ticks of simulation), and ﬁnally the number of unattended patients increases as well.
In Table 3 all these results are shown. It is noticed when the number of patients arrival probability is higher, i.e. 80%,
patients in the waiting rooms increases (shown in Table 3).

space, 16,632 staﬀ scenarios (which results of assuming a combination of two types -junior or senior- of up to 8
doctors, 6 nurses, and 4 admissions, i.e. 44 × 27 × 14). There are many scenarios that give a good index value, but
there are two of them that are the most important, as shown in Table 4.

Although both staﬀ conﬁgurations are almost the same, they have diﬀerent minimum average waiting time, this is
why the ﬁrst staﬀ conﬁguration label as Best 2, despite its lower cost has a worst minimum average waiting time. Not
only the index is diﬀerent and higher, but its standard deviation of patient waiting time is higher. It is important to
notice that a staﬀ conﬁguration a bit more expensive has almost 10% lower variation coeﬃcient of the patient waiting
time, as well as almost a third lower index value and minimum average waiting time.
5. Conclusions and future work
A simple but realistic Agent-Based Model to simulate Healthcare Emergency Departments (ED) has been proposed an applied. The main objective of the model is to be used as a tool to help EDs managers in setting up strategies
and management guidelines to optimize the operation of EDs. The model takes into account the complexity and dynamic nature of the EDs which are diﬃcult to characterize. The model uses Moore state machines based agents which

act and communicate within a deﬁned layout. The simulations presented here serve to test the model. Two simulation
experiments were carried out using real data about the staﬀ conﬁguration and the (minimum) physical infrastructure
of a Hospital ED. Two diﬀerent indexes were set to evaluate the operation of the Agent-Based Emergency Department
simulator. Even though the search of the optimum staﬀ conﬁgurations analyzed, 4,536 and 16,632 for the ﬁrst and
second experiments, respectively, were performed through an exhaustive search technique (which implies a lot of
search time) the results are encouraging, since not only they are as expected (larger and more experienced staﬀ lead
to shorter average patient waiting time), but also show interesting results when the waiting time standard deviation is
analyzed. Indeed the simulation experiments allowed to understand, and analyse better the problem. However, even
with the small problem size analized the number of combination is large, as well as the computing time. Moreover,
the resources that this problem would demand to perform statistical analysis for longer periods (ﬁrst to reproduce and
then to foretell) are huge. Therefore, a better optimization approach rather than exhaustive search, must be used.
As future work, an alternative methodology scheme for optimization is being devised. This approach consists in
ﬁnding a continuous function that describes the Emergency Department operation, which is a discrete and multidimensional problem, and through such function will allow us to obtain the optimum, or at least reduce the search space.
Thus, getting as a result of doing such an intelligent search will very likely reduce time and computing resources utilized. This scheme would be an intermediate approach between an exhaustive search technique and an heuristic one.
Moreover, due to the multidimensional nature of the problem, i.e. large number of individuals, the number of states
in the state machine of each individual, and the diﬀerent time periods, a large number of values should be computed.
Therefore, High Performance Computing will have to be used.
