Abstract. We develop a new numerical approach of the electromagnetic wave
propagation in a complex media model. We use a new Finite Element Method
for space discretization and a finite difference method in time domain. This
study is applied to TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) which appears as a
wave guide. In this context, the experimental approach is very uneasy and the
numerical study brings about very interesting results, particularly for local
values of the electromagnetic field. Moreover we test models of an
heterogeneous medium. Dielectric properties of the medium are represented by
an homogeneous component associated with Dirac distribution. We present
wave front profiles with useable signals simulation.
Keywords: Finite Element Method, Backward Difference Method, Maxwell’s
equations.

1 Introduction
We present a model of electromagnetic wave propagation in a wave guide containing
a complex medium. This work is a contribution to the interpretation of the TDR
(Time Domain Reflectometry) probe’s signals. The TDR probe [1] is a wave guide
constituted by two parallel metallic rods. At initial time, a step of electric field is
applied between the electrodes and intensity is measured at the entrance of the wave
guide. Measurement and processing of the signal obtained by reflection should
theoretically allow the determination of medium properties. An interesting application
of this technology concerns soil science. In practice, a soil is composed of a complex
mixture with inhomogeneous electric permittivities.
The theoretical approach is formulated using Maxwell’s equations. They are solved
in the time domain using the Finite Element Method. Moreover we consider an
homogeneous medium in which random space distribution of electric properties is
added to some finite element nodes with Dirac distribution. Each numerical
simulation is performed using a given ratio r of Dirac dedicated nodes. The main
objective is then to study the influence of ratio r on the electric signal.

2.2 Finite Element Formulation

The Finite Element method is applied to Maxwell’s equations. In our formulation, we
use the weak formulation, presented by Chambarel et al [3], with Galerkin’s
ponderation [4], in order to obtain integral forms for the electromagnetic equations.
Then, with the Finite Element formulation of the integral forms for a first order form
of Maxwell’s equations, we can get an approximate solution of the weak formulation,
with discretization of the electric and the magnetic fields. The weighted residual
method can be written:
∂H

∫(Ω ) δH .µ r . ∂t .dΩ = − ∫(Ω ) δH .curl E.dΩ

(2)

∂E

∫(Ω ) δE.ε r . ∂t .dΩ = ∫(Ω ) δE.curl H .dΩ
In formula (2), ε r incorporates the Dirac distribution.
The medium arises as a medium whose permittivity is homogeneous but in which a
distribution of singularities is inserted. For the Dirac formulation of electric
permittivity we define the following density θ :

εr =

dθ
dΩ

ε r = ε H + ∑ θ p . δ (x − x p )

(3)

p

where index H denotes the homogeneous component of the medium. So the weak
formulation becomes :
∂H

∫(Ω ) δH .µ r . ∂t .dΩ = − ∫(Ω ) δH .curl E.dΩ
⎛
∂E ⎞
∂E
∫(Ω ) δE.ε H . ∂t .dΩ + ∑ ⎜⎜ δE.θ p . ∂t ⎟⎟
p ⎝
⎠

(4)
= ∫(Ω ) δE.curl H .dΩ
x= x p

In that way, we can define the discretization. Let ni (x) be a base of work space and
index n denote the elementary nodal values. For an isoparametrical element the
polynomial interpolation can be written:
x ih = n j .x ijn , H ih = n j .H ijn

and

E ih = n j .E in

3 Numerical Resolution
We obtain a large size time-differential system. By inversion of the mass matrix [M],
the general formulation of this differential system is :

d
{U } = [M ] -1 . {Ψ (U, t )} where {Ψ (U , t )} = {F} - [K ]. {U}
dt

(13)

For the numerical quadrature of formula (11) we choose the nodes of the element as
integration points [3]. Consequently, the mass matrix [M] is diagonal and this
inversion is an easy procedure. It is a necessary condition for the efficiency of the
methods described below. For numerical time-resolution, we modify the Backward
Difference Method [5]. With the propose formulation one can choose the time order
of discretization and the upward scheme. Under these conditions we can test a semiimplicit method. With the matrix-free technique, the mass matrix and the stiffness
matrix are never built: only the elementary matrices in (11) are calculated. So we note
a high performance level both for the CPU and the storage costs.

where α is the upward time-parameter.
This method requires inner iterations for each time-step with index I, for ∆U
determination, and the convergence criteria can be written for example at the first
order [5]:

α . ∆t .

∂
∂U

{[M ]

.Ψ (U , t )

} <1

let ∆t < ∆t 0

(15)

But we always find a time-step value for the convergence of the process. We note the
good stability of the scheme in the implicit case. If α < 0.5 a CFL condition is also
required [6]. In this way we choose a time step as follows [7]:
∆t ≤ Min (∆t 0 , ∆t CFL )
The advantage of this method is the matrix free technique associated with an iterative
method. The initial solution of each time step is close to the next solution. So the

Modeling of Electromagnetic Waves in Media with Dirac Distribution

number of inner iterations is very low, two or three in practice. Initially the
electromagnetic field is zero in full domain. For time tk, the time step ∆tk can be
changed at each step with a CFL condition.
3.2 The Software

For this method to work with efficacy, we must adapt each formulation in accordance
with the boundary conditions. For easy adaptation of the code to the different
formulations described above we must have a dedicated software. We use efficient
C++ Objects-Oriented Programming for the Finite Element code called FAFEMO
(Fast Adaptive Finite Element Modular Object). All details are given in reference [3].
Figure 1 shows the general structure of the compact code. It is organized in three
classes corresponding to the functional blocks of the FEM’s different stages. With
these classes we built three objects that are connected by a single heritage. So the
transmission of the parameters between the objects is defined by a list technique. We
adapt the “class elementary matrices” for Dirac distribution.

This constitutes a general Finite Element solver for the Maxwell equations.

4 Numerical Results
We study the transverse magnetic mode -T.M.- in the case of a 2D model. Figure 2
shows the meshing of the domain. We use here a high density of elements because the
wave front propagates in the whole domain, but does not return significantly in the
wave guide. In this context we develop stationary waves and we notice at each period

644

A. Chambarel and H. Bolvin

that a part of the electromagnetic energy is scattered in the cavity. So the amplitude of
the signal decreases (Fig. 3). After the electromagnetic field computation, we can
deduce the value of the signal by Ampere’s theorem. For TDR technology only
intensity at the entrance of the wave guide is measurable. So we simulate the useable
signal.

Another test studies the effect of a single Dirac distribution. Each distribution
concentrates the electromagnetic energy. Figure 4 gives the details around a
distribution and Figure 5 shows the electromagnetic energy in the wave guide with
several distributions.

single Dirac distribution

the wave guide

The curve in Figure 6a shows the differential signal obtained by a single Dirac
distribution visible in the wave guide (Fig.6b). The progressive wave reflects on the
Dirac distribution and a signal returns towards the entrance. In practice our numerical

model is constituted by many distributions with random localizations (Fig. 7a) (Fig.
7b). The superposition of the multiple signals associated to each distribution is
associated to a mean electric property of the complex medium. So it is possible to
choose a random profile of Dirac distributions according to a complex medium model
as a soil.

5 Conclusion and Further Works
We have presented a numerical study of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in
a complex medium. First we have developed a set of numerical techniques applied to
Maxwell’s equations. A special algorithm has been developed for wave front study.
Secondly we have tested a new model of complex medium by introduction of Dirac

distributions in the physical properties. Also we hope to modelize the electric
properties of a soil. This numerical simulation is performed by Object-Oriented
Programming. In this context we obtain efficient and low cost calculus. This set of
techniques constitutes a very interesting tool for soil science.
