Abstract. This article analyzes the problems of business bankruptcy, and the
methods for bankruptcy prediction. This study proposed to join two models, one
is the multi-discriminate Z-Score created by Altman, and the other is the Selforganizing maps. We proposed to generate self-organizing maps based on the
financial data of public companies that are included in the NASDAQ list. These
maps were used for bankruptcy prediction as well as creating classification of
financial risk for Lithuanian companies. Comparing the weak results of
prediction we accelerated by changing of ratios weights of the Altman Z-Score
model. In this way, it can fit to conditions of the Lithuanian conjuncture. Based
on the original ratio weights in Altman’s Z-Score the results predicting
Lithuanian bankruptcy were weak. The weights of Altman’s Z-Score model
were changed to fit the Lithuanian economic circumstance.
Keywords: self-organizing maps, Z-Score, bankruptcy, prediction, bankruptcy
class, multivariate discriminate model, Altman.

1 Introduction
The forecasting of bankruptcy has always been a relevant task in the finance
markets. Available algorithms of statistical and artificial intelligence and the
combination of these methods provide more accurate and predictable results [8],
[1], [7], [5]. The early history of research attempts to classify and predict
bankruptcy is well documented in [4]. The historical development of statistical
bankruptcy models can be divided into 3 stages: 1) univariate analysis (by Beaver in
1966); 2) multivariate (or multiple discriminate [MDA]) analysis, and 3) Logit
analysis (initiated by Ohlson).
The purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid artificial-discriminate model to be
used as a predictive measure of corporate financial health (0-healthy, 1-bankrupt),
based in an unsupervised artificial neural network and a multivariate discriminate
model by Altman. Altman’s Z-Score model was created for companies that are best
characterized in a perfect market economy as evidenced by his use of USA companies
financial statements. In light of this mathematical basis a second purpose to this paper
has been to present a methodology for adapting Altman’s Z-Score model based in the
economic reality of developing countries; specifically to propose changing the weight
measures in Altman’s Z-Score variables.

A hybrid SOM-Altman Model for Bankruptcy Prediction

365

Therefore, the focus is to explore the capabilities of an unsupervised learning type
of artificial neural network – self-organizing map (SOM) to solve such problems as
bankruptcy and financial condition. Secondly it is to describe other related work
through SOM in predicting bankruptcy and financial distress. In the third part a
methodology is presented using a hybrid SOM-Altman model to bankruptcy
prediction, and fourthly, the results of this study are demonstrated using the proposed
model. In the last section the main conclusions are presented and discussed.

2 Related Work
Artificial neural networks (ANN) are divided into supervised and unsupervised
learning [8]. When working in the realm of prediction supervised ANN are normally
used. The aim of this investigation is to observe the capabilities of an unsupervised
ANN to predict bankruptcy classes of specifically Lithuanian companies.
The Self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised learning artificial neural
network that is generated without defining output values. The outcome of this process
is a two-dimensional cluster map that can visually demonstrate the financial units
which are scattered according to similar characteristics. In this case the bankruptcy
class of data is labeled on the map and the data distribution is analyzed. A detailed
description of the SOM method is presented in [11].
During the past 15 years investigations in area of SOM applications to financial
analysis have been done. Doebeck described and analyzed most cases in [6]. Martindel-Prio and Serrano-Cinca were one of the first to apply SOM in financial analysis.
They generated SOM’s of Spanish banks and subdivided those banks into two large
groups, the configuration of banks allowed establishing root causes of the banking
crisis [2].
Kiviluoto [10] made a map by means of including 1137 companies, out of which
304 companies were crashed. SOM’s are said to give useful qualitative information
for establishing similar input vectors. Based on Kiviluoto’s study, through visual
exploration one can see the distribution of important indicators (i.e. bankruptcy) on
the map.
The previous authors work is based in an historical or current analysis of company
and market conditions. Through this work they have been able to take past settings
and predict forwards in time the outcomes of bankruptcy or crisis periods in market
economy. It is proposed here that by generating SOM’s to current information future
segmentation of credit classes can be discerned for new or existing companies.

3 Methodology
In this section the SOM and Altman’s Z-Score model are introduced as well as a
hybrid SOM-Altman model. The hybrid model was created on the basis of the SOM
and Altman’s Z-Score with an applied new methodology to change the weights of
Altman’s Z-Score variables under a specific dataset test.
In the self-organizing process the output data are configured in a visualization of
the topologic original data. The unsupervised learning of the SOM is based on
competitive learning (“winner takes all”). A detailed description of the SOM
algorithm is presented in [6], [11], [5].

Altman's Z-Score predicts whether or not a company is likely to enter into
bankruptcy within one or two years. Edward Altman developed the “Altman Z-Score"
by examining 85 manufacturing companies in the year 1968 [3]. Later, additional “ZScores” were developed for private manufacturing companies (Z-Score - Model A)
and another for general/service firms (Z-Score - Model B) [4].
According to E. Altman the Z-Score bankruptcy-predictor combines several of the
most significant variables in a statistically derived combination. It was originally
developed on a sampling of manufacturing firms. The algorithm has been consistently
reported to have a 95 % accuracy of prediction of bankruptcy up to two years prior to
failure on non-manufacturing firm. Z-Score for private firms is as follows [4]:

Z = 0.717(X1) + 0.847(X2) + 3.107(X3) + 0.420(X4) + 0.998(X5)

(1)

where
X1 = Working capital/Total assets (captures short-term liquidity risk),
X2 = Retained earnings/Total assets (captures accumulated profitability and
relative age of a firm),
X3 = Earnings before interest and taxes/Total assets (measures current
profitability),
X4 = Book value of Equity/Book value of total liabilities (a debt/equity ratio
captures long-term solvency risk),
X5 = Net sales/Total assets (indicates the ability of a firm to use assets to generate
sales),
and
Z = Overall index.
In the original model a healthy private company has a Z >3; it is non-bankrupt if
2.7<Z<2.99; it is in the watch-listed zone if 1.8 < Z < 2.69; it is unhealthy (bankrupt)
if it has a Z <1.79. This paper has corrected the bankruptcy classes where a healthy
private company has Z>1.8 and bankrupt company has a Z score of <1.8, (e.g. we
eliminated the “gray” zone).
In figure 1 is presented the algorithm of the proposed hybrid methodology for
bankruptcy class prediction.
The main steps are as follows:
1 On the basis of the NASDAQ list companies financial statements, the Altman’s ZScore variables are calculated and converted to bankruptcy classes (0-healthy, 1bankrupt).
2 Data preprocessing is executed. It consists of a normalized data set, a select map
structure, a topology, a set of other options like data filter, and a set of delay etc.
3 The SOM is generated. The Inputs of SOM are the Altman’s Z-Score variables and
the labels are bankruptcy classes.
4 The SOM is labeled with the bankruptcy classes.
5 On the basis of the TEST list companies financial statements the Altman’s Z-Score
variables are calculated. Bankruptcy classes (0-healthy, 1-bankrupt) are assigned.
Companies that are included in the TEST lists will be used in this study and we
will be predicting their bankruptcy class and their weights Altman model weights.
At this step we calculate Altman’s Z-Score variables on the original weight basis.
6 The generated SOM is labeled with the bankruptcy classes of TEST companies.

7 Labeled units of the trained SOM are compared with the same units labeled with
TEST bankruptcy classes.
8 Corresponded units are calculated.
9 The second part of the algorithm is created in order to increase the number of
corresponding TRAIN and TEST checked labels which are located on the same
SOM map unit number.

10 The attempt is made to create such a map structure within which the amount of
unit numbers has the biggest corresponding label number.
11 The assessment of the influence of each of Altman’s model variables to the
number of corresponding labels.
12 When the performance of the prediction doesn’t change the algorithm is stopped.
The results of this algorithm can be presented as follows:
1. A new SOM with a concrete prediction percentage;
2. A new multivariate discriminator model that is based on Altman’s Z score but with
corrected weight variables.

4 Results of Experiments
In this paper the possibilities of the use of SOM’s have been studied using two real
financial datasets: companies from NASDAQ list, (or TRAINDATA) loaded from
EDGAR PRO Online database, and a dataset of Lithuanian company financial
statements (TESTDATA) presented by one of the Lithuanian banks.
The basis for generating the SOM is TRAINDATA. The calculated bankruptcy
ratios are used as inputs and the Z-Scores from Altman’s Z-Score model are used as
labels for the identification of units in the SOM.

The SOM was trained using the SOM Toolbox for Matlab package [9]. From the
U-matrix in Figure 2 the SOM formed four clusters. By looking at the labels, it can be
seen that the two clusters in the left corresponds to the bankrupt class. The two other
clusters in the right part of U-matrix correspond to the healthy class.

The next step is to label the map with the TESTDATA labels and calculate the
corresponding units between the TRAINDATA and the TESTDATA labels It is
important to note that only the units that were not empty in both TRAIN and TEST
cases are being compared. The ratio between corresponding units and the number of

all TESTDATA labels in the SOM map defines accurateness of bankruptcy prediction
which is equal to 72.678%. The U-matrix with TESTDATA labels presents at
Figure 3(a).
In order to increase the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction the cycle of SOM
structure change is created. By changing SOM size, the following accuracy of
bankruptcy prediction results is acquired:

From the results we can see that the bigger the size of the map, the lower the
accuracy of bankruptcy prediction. The best results are acquired with the map size of
22x18.
The next investigation was concerned with the influence of each of Altman’s
model variables to the performance of bankruptcy prediction. In the process of the
cycle the weight of each variable is being changed and the change in accuracy in
bankruptcy prediction is being monitored. It was noticed that during the change of
label weights the accuracy of prediction achieved its highest score and it gradually
dropped afterwards. The results show that the most important influence in the
performance of bankruptcy prediction is the Net Sales/Total assets variable, and
secondly is the EBIT/Total assets variable. The performance result after the
correction of the variable weights increased from 72.678% up to 92.352% as
follows:

Other variables have less influence between American and Lithuanian companies.
The variables of profitability and turnover are the most important factors which have
the largest weight to predict bankruptcy.
U-matrix with TESTDATA labels presented as follows (Figure 3 (b)) and can be
visually compared with U-matrix before corrections of variable weights (Figure 3(a)).
It can be seen that bankrupt and healthy class labels distributed comparatively to the
labels in TRAINDATA (Figure 2).
