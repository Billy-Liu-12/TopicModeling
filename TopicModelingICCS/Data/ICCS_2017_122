by a graph as defined in Section 2. In previous research, centrality measures has been used to
analyse relational structures in organisations [4, 5, 2] and terrorist groups [6]. The network size
in these studies are between 30 and 150 individuals. Centrality measures have shown promising
results to find central individuals in small and organised networks – although the networks has
been incomplete or is just a sample from the total population.
However, real world datasets are neither small nor organised, and they often requires data
preprocessing before they can be analysed. Although centrality measures has performed good
on networks of smaller sizes by finding interesting individuals, this does not mean they will also
perform good on larger and more loosely structured [1] networks. This paper is guided by the
research question: How can graph-based methods be applied to identify important individuals
within a real-world online communication network? Our research question seeks to determine
the feasibility of centrality measures in applying it to the area of civil and criminal investigations.

Methodology

We extracted information to represent the communication within Nulled.IO as graphs: users
and the messages between them, represented as vertices and edges respectively. It has not
been pre-filtered and is used in its original form (detailed in Section 3) except for separating
public and private messages; which results in two graphs with public communication between
26.11.2012 - 06.05.2016 and private communication between 14.01.2015 - 06.05.2016.
The reason for this division is twofold: (i) communication patterns is likely to be different
between them, and (ii) civil investigators only have access to public communication in their
investigation, whereas criminal investigators will have access to both.
The four centrality measures under evaluation are:
degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. They
differ in the interpretation of important, thus different
individuals will be ranked as more important in the
same network; illustrated in Figures 1 - 4.
A (undirected) graph G = (V, E), where V is the
set of vertices and E is the set of edges, is represented
Figure 1: Largest degree centrality
in terms of the binary adjacency matrix A. Degree
centrality is the most basic measure as it only counts
directly adjacent vertices.
For a vertex v ∈ V , it is den
fined by CD (v) = u=1 Av,u , where n = |V |. The centrality measures discussed in this paper do not consider
the diagonal elements in A [8], where v = u, because
the relationship to oneself is not important.
Figure 2: Largest betweenness cenBetweenness centrality looks at how often a vertex trality
sits in the geodesic (shortest path) between two other
vertices. A vertex is considered more important because it can act like a broker – i.e. arrange or negotiate plans and deals – and have more
influence on the network by choosing to withhold or distort information [8]. Figure 2 highlights
the vertex in the network with the highest betweenness centrality score, because it sit in between twolarge subgraphs and one vertex. Betweenness centrality for a vertex v is defined by
∂u,v,w
CB (v) =
∂u,w , where ∂u,w is the total number of shortest paths between vertex u and w,
and ∂u,v,w is the number of those paths that pass through v, and u = v = w.

Closeness centrality looks at the distance between
one vertex and all the other vertices. A vertex is considered more important if it has a short distance to
other vertices. In other words: the sum of distances
to other vertices is low. Figure 3 highlights the vertex
in the network with the best closeness centrality score,

CC (v) = [ u=1 d(v, u)] , where d(v, u) is the distance
(length of the shortest path) connecting v to u.
Eigenvector centrality expand on the idea of degree
centrality, as it considers the edges to adjacent vertices.
A vertex’s score is not dependent on how many vertices Figure 4: Largest eigenvector centralit is connected to, but on many its adjacent vertices are ity
connected to. This means that a vertex is important
only if its neighbours are important – if they also have
a higher degree centrality in the network. Figure 4 highlights the vertex in the network with
the highest
eigenvector centrality score. Eigenvector centrality for a vertex v is defined in

CE (v) = λ1 u=1 Au,v CE (vu ), where λ = 0 is some constant. The eigenvector value of vertex v
is weighted by the sum of degree centralities of adjacent vertices.

Case Study Design

The database dump1 used in our analysis is from an online forum (accessible from the clearnet)
for distributing cracked software and trading stolen credentials. It is a 9.45 GB file, which
was leaked 12.05.2016, with details about 599 085 user accounts, including 800 593 private and
3 495 596 public messages. It was used as a substitute for less available darknet forums datasets,
because forum users in both dark- and clearnet rely on electronic messaging to communicate,
plan and organise. Although similarities between dark- and clearnet forums has not been shown
in previous research, it is not unlikely to expect they are formed by similar social forces.

Table 1 show a full list of database (DB) tables and fields used to extract the needed
information for constructing the graphs. The resulting two graphs was then exported in a
Graph Exchange XML Forumat (GEXF), to ease later analyses. Two DB tables was combined
to construct the public communication graph. DB table topics contains information on the
author of forum threads, so field starter id is treated as source vertex. For each forum thread
(topic), field topic id was used to retrieve all messages posted on that topic ID from DB table
posts. Field author id was treated as the target vertex, and for each message found the edge
weight between two vertices was incremented.
DB table message topics hold the metadata for private communication, where field
mt starter id is used as source vertex, mt to member id as target vertex, and mt to count +

mt replies as edge weight. The edge weight is the sum of messages sent to the recipient and
the number of replies. The data extraction and analysis was performed on an Ubuntu 15.10
desktop computer, with Python scripts that we wrote for this purpose. The software used in
this case study was MySQL and Python, with packages Networkx and MySQLdb.

Results

This section contains the result from four centrality measures on two (undirected) graphs.
Which are divided into public and private, as seen in Table 2 and 3 respectively. Tables are
sorted in descending order by their centrality value, because higher values indicate more central
positions in the respective measures. They are limited to the first five results due to page
limitations, however, it is enough to demonstrate that users are ranked differently according to
centrality measures’ interpretation of important.

The values has been normalised so networks of different sizes can be compared with each
other. Networkx can normalise the results for us. All values in Table 2 and 3 have been
normalised in the range [0, 1], according to equations found in [8].
We started the analysis on users that occopied similar ranks between each centrality measures and type of communication, to understand why they get their ranks. It was performed by
manually inspecting the message contents, and it revealed that many of these individuals had
roles such as administrator and moderators in Nulled.IO. In addition to having responsibilities
and being active on the forum, they also contributed with cracked software (mostly cheats for
games) and distributing user credentials. Users in eigenvector centrality, in Table 3, differed
from users in the other centrality measures as the two highest ranking users (ID 193974 and
61078) was selling services of converting or trading between currencies.
Users with ID 1 and 15398 is ranking highest for degree centrality in both tables, up to 2.75
and 4.82 times larger than the second highest values respectively. But they get their values
because they are connected to more neighbours than other users. This indicate that they are
very active in the hacker forum by communicating with many different users.
In Table 3, user with ID 1 is 2.92 times larger than the second highest value in betweenness
centrality, which indicate that this user is sitting in between a lot more users. However, results
from closeness centrality indicate that the network is more connected. As it shows that users
have about equally short path to all other users – as it only decreases by 0.053 after 100 users.
There was only user with ID 15398 in Table 2 that had significant values in all of the centrality
measures. Because of our approach to construct the public graph, this would indicate that the
threads created by user ID 15398 is very popular, with 70 906 edges connecting to other users.

Conclusion

Organised criminal groups use anonymisation techniques to operate and move their illegal activities online. Where they form communities that are used as marketplaces for illegal materials,
products and services. This drives the underground economy by providing services that facilitate almost any type of cyber crime. The challenge for law enforcement investigators is to
know which individuals to focus their efforts and resources on, in order to disrupt the services
provided by cyber criminals.
In this paper we assessed the performance of four graph-based centrality measures, for
their ability to identify important individuals which provide valuable services to other cyber
criminals. Centrality measures have previously been used to study small and structured data
sets (for example Enron). However, we tested them on a newly leaked dataset that is larger,
more loosely structured and a network with similarities to cyber criminal forums. Our result
shows that well established graph-based measures have weaknesses when applied to this new
dataset. For example, some individuals are ranked high and appears to be important to the
forum. However, they actually had less important contribution to the community, and their
removal would have a low impact on illegal operations from the criminal forum.
Investigators already have centrality measures available in tools they use, such as IBM
i2 Analyst’s Notebook. However, they need to understand that it is not a silver bullet that
automatically identifies important users. To avoid accusing someone for being the leader in
a cyber criminal network, further analysis is needed to confirm they are really important for
investigator’s goals. Focusing on wrong individuals can be illustrated with a real-world example:
In 2013, Silk Road was taken down after arresting some of their administrators. After law
enforcement interference, a dozen new marketplaces spawned and took Silk Road’s place.
Another important aspect to improve the results is to pre-filter the dataset before analysis.
This can be done by removing dependent vertices (i.e CD (v) = 1), which can improve betweenness centrality results. The Nulled.IO forum should also have been analysed as a directed graph.
Then additional centrality measures such as in- and out-degree would be able to identify users
with high popularity and expansiveness respectively.
