Abstract
In this paper, we propose a method derived from a Nitsche approach for handling boundary and transmission
conditions in some partial diﬀerential equations. Several years ago, the Nitsche method was introduced to impose
weakly essential boundary conditions in the scalar Laplace operator. We propose here an extension to vector div −curl
problems. Two examples of applications are presented. The ﬁrst one is concerned with the Maxwell equations. This
allows us to solve these equations, particularly in domains with reentrant corners, where the solution can be singular.
The second example deals with the Navier-Lame equations. One can handle the case of a crack existence in a plate
domain made of several diﬀerent layers, characterized by diﬀerent material properties. Numerical experiments are
reported.
Keywords: Nitsche Method, Maxwell equations, Singular domains, Elasticity, Crack tip.

1. Introduction
The eﬃcient numerical treatment of boundary and transmission conditions is constantly an interesting subject that can
have many applications, for instance in domain decomposition methods. Several approaches are possible: These conditions can be treated as essential boundary conditions. This means that they are explicitly included in the deﬁnition
of the function spaces, that corresponds more or less to the classical approach. Another way consists in approximating
boundary conditions by introducing Lagrange multipliers. This can be found in [2] for the Dirichlet problem.
Another approach which is of interest is related to the Nitsche Method [12], transferred to continuity conditions by
Stenberg. Several years ago, J. Nitsche introduced a method to impose weakly essential boundary conditions in the
scalar Laplace operator. This formulation has several advantages: It is well adapted to conforming ﬁnite element,
it is an eﬃcient way to reuse available codes, built on conforming ﬁnite element methods. In addition, the Nitsche
formulation leads to a symmetric, deﬁnite, positive discrete formulation, in agreement with symmetry and ellipticity

of the boundary value problem formulation. Even if a stabilizing parameter appears, it is not yet a penalty method as
it is consistent with the solution of the system of equations. Moreover, this parameter can be estimated to ensure the
ellipticity of the discrete operator. We remark also that the Nitsche method is often used as a mortaring technique [9],
[10] that does not require to introduce additional unknowns like Lagrange multipliers. As shown in [3], the method
can be viewed as a stabilization technique.
In this paper, we propose a generalization of the classical Nitsche formulation to div or div -curl problems. We ﬁrst
brieﬂy review this approach for the Laplace problem. Then, we introduce a generalization of the Nitsche formulation
to some linear partial diﬀerential equations.
We will ﬁrst consider the Maxwell equations for electromagnetic ﬁelds. Hence, the boundary conditions involved are
related to the tangential and the normal trace of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Despite some similarity with the Symmetric
Interior Penalty Method (SIGP) (cf. [7]), the formulation proposed here is not a special case. Indeed, like all Discontinuous Galerkin methods (see [4] for a historical survey), SIGP assumes discontinuities between each element
of the mesh. Then, continuity across element interfaces has to be weakly enforced by adding suitable bilinear forms
(the so-called numerical ﬂuxes) to the standard variational formulation. On the contrary, the method proposed here
is concerned with the handle of boundary conditions in the Maxwell equations. An interesting consequence of the
proposed approach is that it allows us to solve the Maxwell equations in domains with reentrant corners, where the
solution can be singular.
We will then consider the Navier-Lame equations for elasticity. We will propose a variational formulation that provides
the solution in terms of displacements ﬁeld in the case of a crack existence, for easily handling interface conditions
in multilayer material. This approach allows us to derive a numerical method to simulate crack problem in dissimilar
multilayer media with or without crack at the interface between the several media. The numerical method is easy to
implement and is able to solve problems in singular domains, for instance in domains with cracks, where the stress
ﬁelds tend to inﬁnity.
2. The classical Nitsche method
Nitsche’s method [12] was introduced for imposing essential boundary conditions weakly in the ﬁnite elements
method approximation of Poisson equation with Dirichlet data. Basically, Nitsche’s approach consists in penalizing
the diﬀerence between the approximate solution and the Dirichlet boundary data rather than trying to interpolate that
data directly. It leads to symmetric positive deﬁnite linear systems that can be solved very quickly for instance using
gradient or multigrid numerical methods.The main advantage of Nitsche’s method is that it keeps the convergence rate
of the ﬁnite elements method [13], as opposed to the standard penalty method.
Let Ω be a bounded, open subset of R3 and Γ its boundary, which we assume to be Lipschitz. When the domain is
non-convex, its boundary can contain reentrant corners or edges, which are called geometrical singularities. Then,
denote by n the unit outward normal to Γ. In order to demonstrate Nitsche’s method, we introduce the following
problem:
For given functions f and g, ﬁnd u solution to
−Δu
u

=
=

f
g

in
on

Ω,
Γ.

(1)

To formulate the Nitsche method, we ﬁrst introduce a shape regular ﬁnite element partition Th = ∪K of the domain
Ω. For any element K of the mesh Th , let Pk (K) be the set of all polynomials on K of degree ≤ k. We denote by E a
face (or an edge in 2D) of a element of Th and by Ch the trace mesh induced by Th on the boundary Γ, that is
Ch = {E; E = K ∩ Γ, K ∈ Th } .
Moreover, we assume that the elements of Ch verify the regularity condition, i.e. for the diameter hE of an element
E ∈ Ch and the diameter ρE of the largest inscribed sphere of E, we have hE ≤ CρE , where C is independent of E and

424

h. Finally, we introduce the ﬁnite element space
Vh = {v ∈ H 1 (Ω); v|K ∈ Pk (K)} .
Denote by uh the ﬁnite element approximation of u in Vh , the Nitsche formulation for the problem (1) is written:
Find uh ∈ Vh such that
1
∂v

< g, v >E .
∂n

(2)
Above, β is some positive suﬃciently large constant , and the bracket < ·, · >E denotes the L2 (E) scalar product.
Essentially, Nitsche’s method imposes the boundary conditions via three boundary terms. Two of them contain the
weak form of the normal derivatives of the solution and the test functions. These two terms cause the method to be
symmetric and consistent. The third term (with β) depends on the domain tetrahedrization/triangulation, and causes
the method to be stable. As expected, the solution u is consistent with the Nitsche approach (2). A nice property
of Nitsche’s method is the optimal order of convergence. Indeed, Nitsche proved [12] that if β is a suﬃcently large
constant, then the discrete solution converges to the exact one with optimal order in H 1 and L2 .

3. Nitsche formulation for the Maxwell equations
Consider the Maxwell equations in vacuum, and assume that the boundary Γ corresponds to the interface with a
perfectly conducting body. This results in the perfect conducting boundary conditions on the electromagnetic ﬁeld
E, B
E × n = 0 and B · n = 0 on Γ.

(3)

As we handle the boundary condition, we are basically concerned with the space-dependent part of the model (not the
time-dependent one). Thus, we consider the stationary problem associated with the Maxwell equations equations. We
thus obtain two formulations that can be treated separately, the electric one and the magnetic one, with the same div curl operators but with a diﬀerent boundary condition. In what follows, we ﬁrst present the electric ﬁeld formulation.
The magnetic counterpart will be treated subsequently.
3.1. The Nitsche method for the electric ﬁeld
The electric problem appears as a particular case of the following curl − div problem:
For given functions f, g and h, ﬁnd u such that
curl u = f
div u = g
u×n = h

in Ω ,
in Ω ,
on Γ .

(4)
(5)
(6)

The variational formulations which will be the basis of the Nitsche method reads:
Find u such that
Ω

(curl u · curl v + div u div v) dx− < curl u, v × n >Γ =

Ω

curl f · v dx +

Ω

g div v dx ,

∀v.

(7)

We formulate the Nitsche method for this curl − div problem, following the same approach and the same notations
as for the Laplace operator. Denoting by uh ∈ Vh the approximate solution of u, we can get the discrete formulation
associated to (7). From the boundary condition (6), we derive the variational expression
− < curl v, uh × n >Γ = − < curl v, h >Γ

425

Franck Assous and Michael Michaeli / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 422 – 431

that we add to the discrete approximation of formulation (7). This causes the method to be symmetric and consistent.
To ensure the method to be stable, for a suﬃcient large β, we also add
β
E∈Ch

1
1
< uh × n, v × n >E = β
< h, v × n >E .
hE
hE
E∈C
h

Hence the Nitsche variational formulation of the problem (4-6) is written as:
Find uh ∈ Vh such that

Ω

(curl uh · curl v + div uh div v) dx− < curl uh , v × n >Γ − < curl v, uh × n >Γ +β
E∈Ch

=

Ω

1
< uh × n, v × n >E
hE

curl f · v + g div v dx− < h, curl v >Γ +β
E∈Ch

1
< h, v × n >E .
hE

3.2. The Nitsche method for the magnetic induction
For the same reasons as for the electric ﬁeld, we will only consider here the stationary problem for the magnetic
induction, which appears as a particular case of the following curl − div problem:
For given functions f, g and h, ﬁnd u such that
curl u
div u

= f
= g

in Ω ,
in Ω ,

(8)
(9)

u·n

= h

on Γ .

(10)

The variational formulation of (8-9), wich will be the basis of the method reads here:
Find u ∈ such that
Ω

(curl u · curl v + div u div v) dx− < div u, v · n >Γ =

Ω

f · curl vdx

∀v.

(11)

Now to introduce the Nitsche formulation of the problem, consider still a regular ﬁnite element mesh Th of the domain
Ω, and the ﬁnite element approximation space Vh introduced above. Denote also by uh ∈ Vh the approximate solution
of u. From the boundary condition (10), we derive the variational expression
− < div v, uh · n >Γ = − < div v, h >Γ
that we add to the discrete approximation of formulation (11). This causes the method to be symmetric and consistent.
To ensure the method to be stable (for a suﬃcient large β), we also add
β
E∈Ch

1
1
< uh · n, v · n >E = β
< h, v · n >E .
hE
h
E
E∈C
h

Hence the Nitsche variational formulation of the problem (8-10) is written as:
Find uh ∈ Vh such that

Ω

(curl uh · curl v + div uh div v) dx− < div uh , v · n >Γ − < div v, uh · n >Γ +β
E∈Ch

=

Ω

f · curl v− < h, div v >Γ +β
E∈Ch

< uh · n, v · n >E

1
< h, v · n >E .
hE

(12)

3.3. The two-dimensional case
It is also possible to write down these equations in 2D. Assume that the problem is formally set in an inﬁnite cylinder
Ω, and that the domain, the ﬁeld and the data are all independent of one of the three space variables (x, y, z), let us say
z. Then, one can consider an equivalent problem, in a 2D section of Ω, perpendicular to the axis Oz. Let ω denote
the 2D section, and let γ be its boundary. Denote further by ν the unit outward normal to γ, and by τ the unit tangent
vector such that (ττ, ν ) is direct.
Following the same procedure as in dimension three, one obtains the Nitsche formulation consistent with the twodimensional div -curl problem (with the same notations):
Find uh ∈ Vh such that

ω

(curl uh curl v + div uh div v) dx− < curl uh , v · τ >γ − < curl v, uh · τ >γ +β
E∈Ch

=

ω

1
< uh · τ , v · τ >E
hE

curl f · v + g div v dx− < h, curl v >γ +β
E∈Ch

1
< h, v · τ >E (13)
hE

In the same way, one can derive the Nitsche formulation consistent with the two-dimensional magnetic formulation.
One obtains formally the same expression as above, by replacing the left-hand side by
ω

(curl uh curl v + div uh div v) dx− < div uh , v · ν >γ − < div v, uh · ν >γ +β
E∈Ch

=

ω

f · curl v− < h, div v >γ +β
E∈Ch

1
< uh · ν, v · ν >E
hE
1
< h, v · ν >E .

4. The elasticity problem
As a second example, we consider now the case of a two layer elastic material. The extension to multilayer material
is straightforward. Numerical examples will be given in the following section.Let us consider the deformation of the
domain Ω1 ∪ Ω2 (see Fig.1) which interpreters the elastic dissimilar plate, with the crack whose undeformed shape is
a curve C1 ∪ C2 and which is perfectly jointed on the interface B2 ∪ T 1 . The plate is loaded by the opposed surface
forces at B1 and T 2 in the vertical directions, and ﬁxed on R1 ∪ R2 . We denote the domain boundaries in the following
manner: ΓCi = Ri , for i = 1, 2, ΓF1 = C1 ∪ L1 , ΓF2 = C2 ∪ L2 , ΓL1 = B1 and ΓL2 = T 2 , where the notations Ci , Fi and Li
stand for clamped, free and loaded boundaries respectively for each subdomain Ωi , i = 1, 2. In this case, the problem
is deﬁned as follows, for i = 1, 2:
⎧
⎪
−divSi = Fi in Ωi
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
ui = 0 on ΓCi

, u denotes the displacement, F is an acting force vector. In the case of a
τ xy σy
two layer elastic material, λ and μ are the Lam´e parameters, assumed constant in each domain Ωi , i = 1, 2. Denoting
the interface between the two sub domains Ω1 and Ω2 by
where S is a stress tensor S =

Υ = {(x, y) : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, y = 0} = T 1 = B2 ,

(16)

we have to deﬁne the appropriate boundary interface conditions (see [8], [6]). The interface conditions refer to problem conﬁguration, where the both of the half plates are perfectly jointed on the interface. In this case the interface
transmission conditions are deﬁned as follows:
⎧ 1

τ = τ2xy = 0 on Υ

where the brackets [·] denotes the jump across the interface Υ. The physical meaning of the ﬁrst condition is that there
is no shear stress on the interface. The second condition expresses the continuity of the displacement ﬁelds u across
the interface between the sub domains Ω1 and Ω2 , whereas the third one asserts the continuity of the stress ﬁeld in the
y direction.
4.1. Formulation for the elasticity problem in dissimilar domain with interface
For the easiness of presentation, we denote Sui , i = 1, 2 (resp: Svi , i = 1, 2) the stress tensor associated to the displacement ui , i = 1, 2 (resp: vi , i = 1, 2). Hence, we rewrite our problem in each subdomain as follows

We assume that there are no applied body forces acting inside Ω1 , Ω2 , that is F1 = F2 = 0, and that the only forces
are acting on the upper and lower faces ΓL1 , ΓL2 (ΓL1 = B1 , ΓL2 = T 2 , see Fig.1). Applying the fundamental Green’s
identity for the tensor ﬁelds, we obtain the natural variational formulation for each sub domain Ω1 , Ω2 :

(19)

Up to now, we have not dealt with the transmission condition [u] = 0. For this purpose, we formulate the method for
this elasticity problem, following the same approach and the same notations as for the Laplace operator. Assuming
that we have a regular ﬁnite element mesh Th of the domain Ω, we introduce the ﬁnite element approximation space
Vh of vectorized functions. In this case, Ch denotes the trace mesh induced by Th on the interface Υ. As for the
Laplace operator, we also assume a regularity condition for the elements of Ch . Denoting also by ui the approximate
solution of ui , we readily get the discrete formulation associated to (19). From the transmission condition [u] = 0 on

that we add to the discrete approximation of formulation (19). This causes the method to be symmetric and consistent.
Finally, to ensure the method to be stable, for a suﬃcient large β, we also add

Hence the Nitsche variational formulation of the problem (15) together with the second interface condition of (17) is
written, for each subdomain Ωi , i = 1, 2 as:
Find ui such that

(20)

where u3 stands for u1 . We have now to handle the ﬁrst interface condition of (17), that is τ1xy = τ2xy = 0. This is
performed in a straightforward way by substituting the vanishing shear stress components into the stress tensor Sui for
i = 1, 2, for each integral over Υ in (20). Hence, the stress tensor becomes diagonal and we get

Finally, It remains to take into account the last interface condition of (17), namely σ1y = σ2y , that refers to the continuity
of the stress ﬁeld in y direction. In order to impose it, we couple the second term of each bilinear form (20) for i = 1, 2,
in the following manner:
For Ω1 , we have:
σ1y =σ2y

def

σ1y =σ2y

def

Su1 · n · v1 = σ1x nx v1x + σ1y ny v1y = σ1x nx v1x + σ2y ny v1y = Sx1 ,y2 · n · v1

(22)

Similarly for Ω2 , we get:
Su2 · n · v2 = σ2x nx v2x + σ2y ny v2y = σ2x nx v2x + σ1y ny v2y = Sx2 ,y1 · n · v2

(23)

Note that in our case, since the interface between the two sub domains is part of the axis y = 0, we have that S x1 ,y2
coincides with Su2 and S x2 ,y1 coincides with Su1 . Summing up, our Nitsche type variational formulation of problem
(18) can be written as (still with the y3 stands for y1 in S x2 ,y3 )

5. Numerical Results
We will give two cases to show the validity of the proposed method. We will assume that the geometry and data
are both independent of the space variable z. Then, the domain can be restricted to the two-dimensional domain ω.
5.1. Electric singular case
This ﬁrst case is devoted to the capture of the singular behavior of the electric ﬁeld in a non-convex geometry.
Comparisons with other methods can be found in [11]. We pick an L-shaped domain ω made of triangles, and we
use the continuous P1 Lagrange ﬁnite element. . In such non-convex polygonal (or polyhedral in 3D) domains,
the solutions (electric or magnetic ﬁeld) of Maxwell’s equations can be singular, that is go to inﬁnity when one
comes close to a reentrant corner. This essentially depends on the value of the boundary condition together with the
regularity of the right-hand sides f and g (cf. [1], [5]). We assume vanishing right-hand sides together with a singular
non-vanishing boundary condition. We have then to solve
curl u = 0 in ω ,
div u = 0 in ω ,
u · τ = h s on γ ,

(25)

with (r, θ being the polar coordinates, centered at the reentrant corner)
hs = xs · τ,

x s = − r−1/3

sin( 23 θ)
cos( 23 θ)

This singular case is of interest, because an analytic expression can be computed. Indeed, from equations (25-26),
there exists a potential φ such that Δφ = 0. By using the expression of the boundary condition (27), one ﬁnds that the
solution to (25-27) is precisely x s
On Figure 2-a, we display the solution (x-component) obtained with our approach. The method captures well the
spatial behavior of solution, which is expected to be singular in the neighborhood of the reentrant corner (and far
away from it). In addition, one can check that it corresponds to the theoretical one (see Figure 2-b): the quantitative
results are in very good accordance (this is the same color scale), even though the mesh is not particularly reﬁned near
the corner.

5.2. The case of a multilayer plate
For this second illustration, we consider the results of a test case obtained by presented method in the case of the
dissimilar material made of 4 layers. The testcase refers to the antisymmetric material with three interfaces where
one of them includes the crack, (see Fig.(3). As a consequence of the dissimilarity of the material in this test cases,
the discontinuity in σ x appears (see (d) in Fig.(3), on the other hand, the interface conditions which refer to the
displacements u x , uy continuity and the continuity of the stress σy is well satisﬁed (see (b), (c), (e) in Fig.(3).

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a method derived from a Nitsche type approach to handle boundary and transmission conditions in some partial diﬀerential equations. Two examples of applications have been given. The ﬁrst one
was concerned with the Maxwell equations in singular domains. We have mainly considered the static Maxwell equations, the diﬃculty coming from singular domains being mainly static. However, the extension to the time-dependent
Maxwell equations is straightforward. A numerical example was given in two dimensions as a ﬁrst attempt to show
the eﬃciency of the proposed method. In particular, we show the ability of this approach to approximate a singular
behavior of the Maxwell equations solution in a non-convex geometry. In the second application, we considered the
Navier Lame equations in two dimensional cracked plate for dissimilar materials. We presented a new concept of
handling the interface conditions in the case of interface crack existence in dissimilar materials. A numerical example
was also given in two dimensions for a dissimilar material made of 4 layers. It illustrates the ability of the method to
simulate a crack in dissimilar elastic material. Hence, the method seems promising for instance to compute the stress
ﬁelds in the case of diﬀerent materials, like elasto-plastic, viscoelastic and hyper elastic materials.
