Abstract:

In this paper, we propose a modified pollution error in r-h methods
using singular elements. The algorithm based on the element pollution error
indicator concentrate on boundary nodes. The singular shape function is used
where an element includes a singular point. The conventional automatic mesh
generation method with this special shape function is shown to be very effective in
this algorithm. The boundary node relocation phase and node insertion method are
used alternatively as before. It is shown that the suggested r-h version algorithm
combined with singular elements converges more quickly than the conventional
one.

Introduction

A lot of engineering problems include geometric singularities in their problem
domain and the solution near the singular points make the solution diverge to infinity.
It is shown that the conventional error estimators are insufficient to estimate solution
errors. Babuska pioneered works about error estimators and the effect of remote
elements and introduced a concept of pollution error estimators to include this effect
[1,2,3,4]. The pollution error estimator makes up for the weak points of the local
error estimators. It was demonstrated that the conventional Zienkiewicz-Zhu error
estimator [5,6,7,8] was insufficient and should include a pollution error indicator
[1,4]. The pollution-adaptive feedback algorithm employs both local error indicators
and pollution error indicators to refine the mesh outside a larger patch, which
includes a patch and one to two surrounding mesh layers [2,3].
Special elements with singular shape functions were developed to overcome
singularites in finite element alalysis [9]. It seems that the elements can be combined
to accelerate in the pollution adaptive algorithms. We concentrate only on a problem
boundary since the singularities exist on the boundary and mesh sizes change
gradually regardless of the mesh generation algorithm. A mesh generation algorithm,
which uses a node relocation method (r-method) as well as h-method of the finite
element method for boundary elements, is proposed. The algorithm employs a
boundary-node relocation at first and then does a node insertion based on the
pollution error indicator.

The model problem

Consider a typical L-shaped polygon in two dimension, Ω ⊆ R 2 , with mixed
boundaries ∂Ω = Γ = ΓD ∪ ΓN , ΓD ∩ ΓN = {} where ΓD is the Dirichlet and Γ N
is the Newmann boundary (Fig.1).
ΓD = CD and

ΓN = AB ∩ BC ∩ DE ∩ EF ∩ FA .(

θ

ΓD = CD

ΓN = AB ∪ BC ∪ DE ∪ EF ∪ FA
Fig.1 The L-shaped domain for the model problem
We will consider Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions. Let us consider the
Hilbert space satisfying boundary condition H Γ1D ≡ {u ∈ H 1 (Ω) | u = 0 on ΓD } .
Then the variational formulation of this model problem satisfies (1). And the
solution space will be

S hp,ΓD combining the Hilbert and a trial function space S hp ,

[1].

A patch error was expressed only by a local error, but it was demonstrated that the
pollution error should include the patch error. The local error was improved by
considering a mesh patch ω h with a few surrounding mesh layers. The
equilibrated residual functional is the same for the local error and the pollution error.
But the pollution error was calculated by considering the outside of the larger patch,
ω~h .

The proposed algorithm

3.1 The basic idea
For adaptive control of the pollution error in a patch of interest, the conventional
algorithm fixes meshes in the patch and refines meshes outside the patch especially
near singularities. The algorithm calculates an element pollution indicator and
regularly divides γ % of elements whose pollution indicators are high [2]. This
algorithm is as following Fig.2.

Fig. 2 Structure of the conventional algorithm

We denote the element pollution error M ωh , the local error ε ωh and the
element pollution indicator µτ [2]. Since the conventional algorithm bisects the
element length, it could be accelerated if we have smaller boundary elements near
the singular points. Therefore it is natural to think about combining r and h method.
In our proposed algorithm, special elements with singular shape functions were
adopted to overcome singularites. The special elements can be combined to
accelerate in the pollution adaptive algorithms. Our algorithm employs two ideas.
The first is to adopt special elements with singular shape functions. The other is to
use r-h algorithm in which the node relocation phase and the node insertion phase
are employed alternatively. In the relocation phase, the new boundary element
length is calculated by using the following relationship between the pollution error
estimator and the element size h , [1, 10].

Finally the new element size becomes,

where

This new element size has an effect on the location of the boundary node,
especially the nodes on BC and CD in Fig 1. If the ratio of the element length

(ζ τ )−

2 λ +1

is less than 1, the algorithm moves the node to the singular point. But if it
is greater than 1, the new length is discarded and the location of the node remains
fixed to have stable solution. This relocation method is for reducing the number of
iteration to get the final mesh. The boundary node insertion phase takes part in a
high quality of the error estimator; this phase is the same as others [1,2,3].
3.2 Singular shape functions
For singular shape functions, we follow a generation scheme developed by Huges
and Akin [9]. The r-directional shape function of node i , N i (r ) can be expressed
as the following algorithm.
m

Step 1. N +1 (r ) ←
m

N m+1 (r ) − ∑ N m+1 (ra ) N a (r )
a =1
m

(7)

N m+1 (rm+1 ) − ∑ N m+1 (ra ) N a (rm+1 )
a =1

Step 2. N a (r ) ← N a ( r ) − N a (rm+1 ) N m+1 (r )

a = 1,2,

,m

Step 3. If m+1 < n (number of nodes), replace m by m+1 and repeat steps 1-3
If m+1 = n, stop.
A binary number Flag is employed to alternate the boundary relocation and the
node insertion process. If the flag is 0, the relocation phase is performed. The
algorithm starts with the
initial mesh and set Flag 0. The boundary node relocation is
1
controlled by (ζ τ )− 2 λ +1 . If the value is below 1, the element shrinks to singular
point. In the node insertion phase, a new node is added on the middle of the
boundary element. This r-h method makes fewer nodes on the boundary than the hversion.
The interior mesh generation phase is following the control of nodes on
boundaries. This step is performed by the constrained Delaunay method. And the
finite element analysis and error estimations are following [10].

Numerical Results and Discussions
We considered the mixed boundary-valued problem for the Laplacian over a L-

shaped domain and applied boundary conditions consistent with the exact solution
1

u (r , θ) = r 3 sin( 13 θ) [1].
In order to test the effect of remote elements, an interior patch element ω h whish
is far from the singular point is chosen. A typical L-shaped domain is meshed by
uniform quadratic triangles (p=2) with h=0.125 [10]. The conventional r-h method
adopts r and h phase alternatively. But the node relocation phase converges rather
slowly it is suggested to adopt multiple r phases until it converges under given

conditions. The modified r-h method which combines multiple and single h phase
shows better results than the conventional r-h methods. In table.1, we show the
numerical results for the model problem. Though the local error estimate ( ε ω h ) is
almost constant, the pollution error decreases dramatically with iterations.
The local error estimates change little and are nearly the same for all cases as we
have expected. The pollution error converges after 4 or 5 iterations for the
conventional shape function cases, but the singular shape function case is acceptable
even for the start and changes a little.

Fig. 3 The pollution factor,

β τ versus iteration

The pollution factor is defined by the ratio of a pollution error estimate and local
error estimate β τ = M ω h / ε ω h . In Fig.3 we can see that the pollution factor
decrease quickly for the conventional shape function case, but one iteration is
enough for the modified shape function case. From this result, we note that the
proposed algorithm with modified shape function case shows the best results and is
effective to control the pollution error.
Fig.4 shows that the effectivity index has nearly the same tendency as the
pollution factor. It is almost 1 for the first iteration, but in the conventional shape
function case it needs 4 iterations to converge. Fig. 5 shows the final result for the
proposed r-h method with conventional shape functions, which is obtained after 15
iterations. The number of element is increased to 1,461 and the node is 3,427.

Conclusions

The pollution factor shows that the r-h method is better than the h method. It
converges only after 4 iterations, but is also proved that the results depend on the
combining methods of r and h. The modified r-h method with singular shape
function case shows less value than the conventional counterpart from the start. The
local effectivity index shows the nearly the same tendency. The proposed r-h
algorithm with singular shape function case is easy to handle since it considers only
the boundary elements. This algorithm shows fast convergence and is nearly 1
during iterations.
