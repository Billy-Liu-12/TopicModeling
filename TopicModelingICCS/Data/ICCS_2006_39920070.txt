Abstract. The paper shows how to combine together the Lattice Boltzmann Methods with the time splitting and the grid reﬁnement techniques, in order to solve reaction-diﬀusion processes including very fast
reaction dynamics, i.e. with time and length scales that vary in a wide
range of values. The method is applied to the reaction prototype probML with semi-inﬁnite diﬀusion conditions and
lem: M0 ← M + L
in presence of an electrode where Nernst + ﬂux balance conditions are
considered. Two important geometries are considered, planar and spherical, and oﬀ-lattice boundary conditions are set up, for general irregular
and curved boundaries. We discuss the need, for some cases, of applying
the time splitting and the grid reﬁnement approach to have a numerical
scheme more easily handled and to substantially reduce the computational time. Furthermore, we point out the physico-chemical conditions
to apply the time splitting and the grid reﬁnement to optimise accuracy and performance. In particular, we stress: a) the range of values of
the relaxation BGK parameter to have the best performance in solving
the pure diﬀusive scheme and b) the best values of the grid reﬁnement
factor to preserve a good accuracy and drastically reduce the time of
computation and the memory usage.

Introduction

Environmental physicochemical problems usually involve a large number of
processes that take place over a wide range of space and time scales. We will
consider, in this paper, the typical reaction-diﬀusion process as:
M0 ← M + L

wherein a metal ion M can react in solution with a ligand L forming a complex
ML with given association and dissociation rate constants, ka and kd respectively. Furthermore, the metal ion is reduced at an electrode surface into M0 .
All the species diﬀuse with diﬀusion coeﬃcients, DM , DL , DML and DM0 respectively. Process (1) is a typical electrochemical problem and in environmental
systems is a typical multi-scale problem. In fact, the reaction rate constants and
the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the species can vary over a large range of values.
Typically, the reaction constants ka can take values between 10−6 m3 mol−1 s−1
and 108 m3 mol−1 s−1 , ranging from a complete inert to a fully dynamic case. On
the other hand, the diﬀusion coeﬃcients usually take values from 10−12 m2 s−1
to 10−9 m2 s−1 . As a consequence, the reaction and the diﬀusion may occur at a
diﬀerent time and space scales. We shall focus the attention to the pure reactiondiﬀusion process, by applying a potential E at the electrode surface. We take
E suﬃciently negative relatively to the reduction-oxidation standard potential
E0 . For instance, a value such that E − E0 = −0.3V is large enough in order to
consider the electrode surface acting as a perfect sink for M.
The space-time scales of the system are described by four key parameters.
The space scales of diﬀusion and reaction are described by the diﬀusion layer
thickness δ and the reaction layer thickness μ, respectively (see [1] for a complete
explanation). In many cases, δ, is expressed as [1]:
δ=

πDM t

(2)

where t is the total time in which diﬀusion occurs.
The thickness μ depends on the ratio of the diﬀusion rate of M over its
recombination rate with L [1]:
μ=

DM
ka c∗L

(3)

where c∗L is the bulk concentration of L.
The time scales of reaction and diﬀusion are described, respectively, by the
recombination rate of M with L:
1
(4)
ka c∗L
and the diﬀusion rate of M

δ2
(5)
DM
Relevant cases are those where the concentration of the complex ML is relatively large with respect to M. In fact, let us consider the typical set of values
wherein the bulk concentration of L, c∗L is in excess compared with the bulk
concentration of M, c∗M : c∗M = 10−3 mol m−3 , c∗L = 1mol m−3 , DM = 10−9 m2 s−1 ,
ka c∗L = 108 s−1 . By applying the potential E at the electrode surface, the reaction is forced to be far from the chemical equilibrium and a diﬀusion gradient
is established close to the electrode surface. After one second, the above mentioned parameters take the following values: μ = 3.16 · 10−9 m, δ = 5.6 · 10−5 m,

72

D. Alemani et al.

(ka c∗L )−1 = 10−8 s and δ 2 /DM = 3.14s. Clearly, the reaction and the diﬀusion
processes take place at very diﬀerent scales. In order to numerically solve this
kind of multi-scale process we use two numerical methods, the time splitting
which allows us to discriminate fast and slow processes and the grid reﬁnement
which allows us to localise a ﬁne grid only within regions wherein large variations
of the concentration proﬁles are expected.
1.1

Deﬁnition of the Problem

The semi-inﬁnite diﬀusion-reaction problem (1) is described by the following
system of partial diﬀerential equations deﬁned in an open set Ω (∀t > 0):
∂cM (x, t)
= DM ∇2 cM (x, t) + R(x, t)
∂t
∂cML (x, t)
= DML ∇2 cML (x, t) − R(x, t)
∂t
∂cL (x, t)
= DL ∇2 cL (x, t) + R(x, t)
∂t

(6)
(7)
(8)

where
R(x, t) = kd cML (x, t) − ka cM (x, t)cL (x, t)

(9)

For the planar case, Ω = (0, +∞), the electrode is placed at x = 0. For spherical
case, Ω = R3 − S, the electrode is placed at S = r ∈ R3 : |r| < r0 where r0 is the
radius of the electrode, usually 5-10μm. We shall refer to the electrode surface as
∂Ω for both planar and spherical geometries. In order to compact the notation,
we introduce the functions cX = cX (x, t), with X=M, L, ML to represent the
values of the concentrations of the species involved in the processes.
The equilibrium constant between the species of the reaction (1), K = kkda is
deﬁned by:
c∗
K = ∗ML∗
(10)
cM cL
where c∗X are the bulk concentrations of the species.
Initial conditions are the bulk values of cX :
cX = c∗X

(11)

t=0

The boundary conditions for semi-inﬁnite diﬀusion are the following:
cX → c∗X

x→∞

(12)

ML and L are electroinactive, therefore no ﬂux of ML and L is crossing the
electrode-solution interface (x = 0, ∀t > 0):
∂cML (x, t)
∂x

=0
x=0

∂cL (x, t)
∂x

=0

(13)

x=0

Finally, the Nernst and ﬂux balance conditions at the electrode surface ∂Ω, in
the limit E − E0 << −0.3V, give:
cM (x, t) = 0

x=0

The Numerical LBGK Scheme

The problem stated in equations (6) - (8) is numerically solved by using the
Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method in the LBGK approximation [2, 3]. The LB approach is based on a mesoscopic description of the physical system. The space is
discretized by a grid or a lattice of spacing Δx and a discrete time step of duration Δt. The lattice is identiﬁed by its spatial dimension d and its coordination
number z indicating the number of neighbours of each lattice. Traditionally, the
lattice is then referred to as a DdQz lattice (D stands for Dimension and Q for
Quantities). Important quantities of a LB model are the mesoscopic velocities vi ,
i = 0, ..., z, which denote the admissible velocities of the particles. The admissible velocities reﬂect the chosen lattice topology so that, in one time step, the
particles can reach any of the z neighbouring lattice site. Following the model
proposed by [4], the LBGK dynamics of the system is described by the following
evolution equation:
R(x, t)
(15)

where fi,X (x, t) is the density distribution function, ωX is the relaxation parameter, fi,(eq)
(x, t) is the equilibrium density distribution function and R(x, t) is

2.1

The Time Splitting Method

In order to perform simulations when the time scale of diﬀusion and reaction are
very diﬀerent, we will use the time splitting method, following the work presented
in [1] wherein the time splitting method has been applied to the LBGK numerical
scheme. The complete numerical scheme (15) is now split into its pure diﬀusive
and reactive parts in the following way [1]:
NR ˜
(f (x, t + Δt))
f¯i,X (x + vi Δt, t + Δt) = f˜i,X (x, t + Δt) + Ωi,X

(17)

R
(f˜(x, t ))
f˜i,X (x, t + ΔtK ) = f˜i,X (x, t ) + Ωi,X

(18)

and
Here we have assumed that the time variable t for the reaction equation runs
faster than t, the time variable of the diﬀusion equation. This means that
ΔtK << Δt. In addition, the initial condition of equation (18) is f˜(x, t ) =
f¯(x, t). For a detailed description of the technique and of the symbols introduced, see [1]. However, the time splitting method alone is not suﬃcient to
completely solve processes with very large reaction rates. In the next subsection
we will explain with a simple example, that applying the time splitting, also
requires to adjust the grid size according to the reaction rate.

The Reason to Reﬁne the Grid

Let us consider a simple reaction diﬀusion problem with only one species, say
M, and let us vary the rate k. For a one dimensional problem, considering the
initial and the boundary conditions (11) and (12) and the perfect sink condition
on ∂Ω, the time splitting exact solution reads [5] in the time interval [0, t]:
cM (x, t) = c∗M ekt erf

√
)
2 DM t

(19)

If we consider the exact solution in two points, x and x + Δx, we can write:
cM (x + Δx, t) − cM (x, t) = c∗M ekt erf

x + Δx
x
√
− erf √
2 DM t
2 DM t

(20)

The ﬁrst order Taylor series expansion around x of an amount Δx, with Δx → 0,
allows us to write:
− √x

2

e 2 DM t
cM (x + Δx, t) − cM (x, t) = cM e Δx √
πDM t
∗ kt

(21)

In general, we expect that cM (x, t) will vary smoothly in space to ensure numerical accuracy. So, if we require that |cM (x + Δx, t) − cM (x, t)| < θ , then we obtain
the condition:
√
x2
−kt πDM t
√
·θ
(22)
Δx < e
exp
c∗M
2 DM t
Inequality (22) says that: a) Δx has to be bounded and b) if we consider two
rates k1 and k2 such that k1 > k2 , then Δxk1 < Δxk2 . Therefore, for very fast
reaction dynamics, in order to get a variation between x and x + Δx less than θ,
the grid size Δx has to be chosen small enough, accordingly to inequality (22).
Furthermore, it is not necessary to use the restriction (22) in all the domain.
It is advisable to restrict its usage only to region where this is really needed.
In fact, the initial conditions on the concentration proﬁles cX are chosen such
that equation (10) is fulﬁlled. This fact suggests to use a grid size that satisfy
condition (22) only close to the electrode surface and more precisely within the
region comparable to the reaction layer thickness μ (∼ 2 − 3μ).
2.3

The Time Splitting - Grid Reﬁnement - LBGK Scheme

To simplify the description, we will refer only to the simpler reﬁnement made by
just two sub-grids. Let us divide the domain Ω into two sub-domains Ω1 and Ω2 .
Let us build two grids, G1 , with discretization parameters Δx1 and Δt1 , and
G2 , with discretization parameters Δx2 = gΔx1 and Δt2 = gΔt1 , where g is the
grid reﬁnement factor. The grid G1 covers the set Ω1 , while the grid G2 covers
the set Ω2 . The strategy suggested is based on the conservation of the function
(1)
X
cX and of its ﬁrst derivative ∂c
∂x at the subgrids Γ = G1 ∩ G2 . If we deﬁne cX

and cX as the concentrations deﬁned in the subgrids G1 and G2 respectively,
the conservation conditions are:
(1)

(2)

∂cX

which ensures the continuity of the concentration proﬁles and of the ﬂuxes of
the species X. Following [1], the coupling conditions at x ∈ Γ are obtained by

solving the following system in the unknowns f1,X and f2,X :

where x1 = x − Δx1 and x2 = x + Δx2 . The ﬁnal numerical scheme in the time
interval [t, t + Δt2 ] is the following:
1. Solve the pure diﬀusive problem by applying equation (17) in the coarser
sub-grid G2 and then g-times in the ﬁner sub-grid G1 . Apply the coupling
conditions (23) on Γ by solving the system (24)
2. Solve the pure reactive problem by applying equation (18) in the coarser
sub-grid G2 and then in the ﬁner sub-grid G1 .
2.4

The Oﬀ-Lattice Numerical Boundary Conditions

In order to preserve the accuracy of the numerical scheme also for irregular
boundaries, we propose a numerical discretization of the boundary conditions
where the boundary is not on a grid point. For simplicity only discuss the 1D
problem. Let us consider the grid G1 and two points, x1 and x2 , where x1 is
inside the boundary, x2 outside, and x1 < xb < x2 . The fi,X (x, t) are computed
at x1 only to ensure the appropriate boundary condition at xb , assuming that
interpolation is considered. The Taylor expansion of cX at xb reads:
cX (x2 ) = cX (xb ) + (Δx − xb )

∂cX
+ o(Δx − xb )2
∂x (x=xb )

(25)

Furthermore, we can write the spatial derivative in the rhs of equation (25) as:
∂cX
cX (x2 ) − cX (x1 )
+ o(Δx2 )
=
∂x (x=xb )
Δx

(26)

By combining expressions (25) and (26) we obtain the numerical Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions:
cX (x1 ) = cX (x2 ) −

Δx
(cX (x2 ) − cX (xb ))
Δx − xb

(27)

∂cX
(28)
∂x (x=xb )
All the values of the rhs in equations (27) and (28) are known from the boundary
condition or already computed from the numerical scheme. Note that imposing
cX in the LB scheme can be done as explained in [1].
cX (x1 ) = cX (x2 ) − Δx

Numerical Validation

We show some numerical validations of the method proposed, for a planar electrode case wherein DM = DL = DML = 10−9 m2 s−1 , ka c∗L = 105 s−1 , kd = 103 s−1 .
Initial conditions are c∗M = 9.9 · 10−6 mol m−3 , c∗ML = 9.9 · 10−4 mol m−3 and
√
c∗L = 10−2 mol m−3 . For this case, the scales are: μ = 10−7 m, δ = 5.6 · 10−5 t
2
m, ka1c∗ = 10−5 s, DδM = 3.14 · t s. The simulations are run up to t = 10−2 s. We
L
use the time splitting method by applying the discrete equations (17) and (18)
and the reaction is solved with an implicit scheme. We use the grid G1 from
the electrode surface (x = 0) to the distance xb = 3μ and the the grid G2 for
x > xb . The domain size is ∼ 5 · δ in order to fulﬁl the semi-inﬁnite diﬀusion
conditions (12).
Tables 1 and 2 show the error on the ﬂux computation computed for several
values of the discretization parameters. The relative error with respect to an
analytical result is computed as in [1].
Table 1 shows that the error decreases if the grid size close to the electrode
surface becomes smaller, until Δx1 = μ/20. For smaller grid sizes, the error
increases again, due to the small values of the relaxation parameter. In fact,
when Δx1 = μ/50, the corresponding values of ω1 and ω2 are too small and
the pure diﬀusive scheme loses accuracy. It is reasonable to ﬁx the relaxation
parameters in the range 0.8 < ω < 1.5 to get the best performance. A way to
circumvent this problem would be to have a grid reﬁnement technique where
Δx2
Δx
Δt is constant across the grid instead of Δt . This topic is under investigation.
Table 2 shows the eﬀect of diﬀerent grid reﬁnement factors, g, for Δx1 = μ/20
and Δx2 = gΔx1 , on accuracy and CPU time. The case where only G1 and G2
are used in all the domain, is shown for comparison. If g increases, then the error
increases as well, but the computation time is shorter. However, for g = 8 the
error is more than 5 percent, a value no longer acceptable. It is preferable to
use g = 2 − 4 which allows us to gain time of computation without losing too
much in precision. It is interesting to compare the errors and the computation
time shown for several g with the results obtained by applying only the grid
G1 everywhere. The results show that the grid reﬁnement allows us to reduce
the computation time while keeping a good precision. With g = 2, the error still
remains less than 1% and the computation time is reduced 20% in comparison to
the time required using only the grid G1 . Furthermore, in the last line of table 2,

Conclusions

We have seen that for processes involving fast reactions the grid size should be
small enough to follow the strong variations of the concentration proﬁles close to
the electrode surface. However, the grid size should be chosen carefully in order
to avoid values of the relaxation parameters too small. It is advisable to choose
grid size values, such that the corresponding relaxation parameter values range
between 0.8 and 1.5. The grid reﬁnement is very useful because it allows us to
keep a good precision and to reduce the time of computation.
