Abstract. This paper presents a coupled elastoplastic constitutive model for
predicting the hydraulic and stress-strain-strength behaviour of unsaturated
soils. Hydraulic hysteresis in the water-retention behaviour is modeled as an
elastoplastic process with the elastic region of the saturation degree. The effect
of change in degree of saturation on the stress-strain-strength behaviour and the
effect of change in void ratio on the water-retention behaviour are taken into
consideration in the model, in addition to the effect of suction on the hydraulic
and mechanical behaviour. Model predictions of the stress-strain and waterretention behaviour are compared with those obtained from triaxial tests on
unsaturated soil along isotropic compression, triaxial stress paths with or
without variation in suction.
Keywords: Unsaturated soil, elastoplastic model, water-retention curve,
suction, triaxial test.

1 Introduction
Since the model was proposed by Alonso et al. [1], several elastoplastic constitutive
models for unsaturated soils have been proposed, on both the experimental and
theoretical studies. In the early models, the stress state variables employed in most
models for unsaturated soils are the net stress (the difference between total stress and
pore-air pressure) and the suction (the difference between pore-air pressure and porewater pressure). In these models, the influence of unsaturation on the soil behaviour is
considered through the variable of suction and the degree of saturation is computed
from the suction using the soil-water characteristic curve. Hydraulic hysteresis which
accounts for irreversible behaviour between the suction and the saturation is usually
not considered in these constitutive models. Another shortcoming of these models is
related to their implementation into existing finite element codes for saturated soils
where constitutive relations are always described in terms of effective stresses. As
discussed by Sheng et al [4], using the average skeleton stress and the suction as the
stress variables leads to a convenient implementation of unsaturated soil models into
finite element codes working with effective stresses, whereas using the net stress and
the suction is more appropriate for finite element codes working with total stress.

An Elastoplastic Hydro-mechanical Model for Unsaturated Soils

1139

In recent years, some conceptual models incorporating hydraulic hysteresis of
unsaturated soils have been proposed [2][4][7]. However, most of these models can
only describe the coupled hydro-mechanical behaviour in qualitative terms or are only
formulated for isotropic stress conditions. This paper presents a complete
mathematical formulation of an elastoplastic model for the hydraulic and mechanical
behaviour of unsaturated soils, especially incorporating the effect of the deformation
on the water-retention behaviour. The model performance is then validated
quantitatively by experimental results obtained from suction-controlled triaxial tests
on unsaturated compacted soil along various stress paths.

2 Coupled Hydro-mechanical Model for Unsaturated Soils
2.1 Stress-State Variable for Unsaturated Soils
To identify the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils properly, the
stress-state variables employed in the model are the average skeleton stress σ'ij and

the suction s. The average skeleton stress σ'ij is defined as:
σ'ij = σ ij − u a δ ij + Sr sδ ij .

(1)

where σij is the total stress tensor, Sr is the saturation degree, ua is the pore-air
pressure, and δij is the Kronecker delta. Eq. (1) is similar to the effective stress
proposed by Bishop [2], with Sr taking the place of the weighting factor χ. The
average skeleton stress and the suction are not independent variables, but their workconjugate strains (soil skeleton strains and the degree of saturation) are independent
variables [4]. The average skeleton stress and suction variables adopted in the present
study permit a general form of hydraulic behaviour to be represented and also provide
a smooth transition between the saturated and unsaturated states.
2.2 Formulation of the Elastoplastic Model for Isotropic Stress States

In previous work, the author developed a so-called ‘load-collapse’ (LC) yield curve in
the p-s plane for the isotropic stress [6]. A similar form is adopted in the following
equation, except that the average skeleton stress is new defined as per Eq. (1).

where p 0 y and p 'y are the yield stresses for saturated soil and unsaturated soil with

suction s; p 'n is an isotropic stress at which no collapse occurs when the suction is
decreased; κ is a swelling index for unsaturated soils (including saturated soil in the
e-ln p ' plane); and λ(0) and λ(s) are the slopes of the normal compression lines of

λ(s) is assumed as:

where λ s is a material parameter for identifying the change of λ(s) with suction s.
λ(s) in Eq.(3) has the following feature: when s → ∞ , λ(s) = λ(0) + λ s .

Fig. 1. LC yield curve, SI and SD yield curves for compacted Pearl-clay under isotropic stress
states

The initial LC yield curve CDEF and the subsequent LC yield curve GHIJ in Fig. 1
are depicted using Eqs (2) and (3), and values of the model parameters and the initial
'
state for compacted Pearl-clay, which are given later. When the stress state ( p , s) is
on the left side of CDEF, there is only elastic deformation occurring during the stress
change.
From Eq. (2) we have

When the stress state is inside the LC yield curve, the elastic volumetric strain
increment is given by:

When the stress state is on the LC yield curve and its increment vector points to the
right side of the LC yield curve, the plastic volumetric strain increment is given by:
dε pv =

(λ(0) − κ)dp 0 y
(1 + e)p 0 y

.

(6)

Or, from Eqs (4) and (6):
dε pv =

∂p '

In addition to the LC yield curve, two more yield curves are needed to model
hydraulic behaviour as an elastoplastic process, as shown in Fig. 1. The waterretention behaviour is represented by a suction increase (SI) yield curve and a suction
decrease (SD) yield curve. The water-retention curve is assumed as Fig. 2.

The change in the degree of saturation due to the change in void ratio is attributed
to the elastic part of the increment of the degree of saturation. When the change in the
degree of saturation is elastic, i.e. along the scanning curves, the elastic increment of
the degree of saturation can be derived from Eq. (1) as follows:

dSer = −λ se de − k s

ds

s

(8)

The plastic change in the degree of saturation can expressed as:
dSpr = dS − dSer = (λ sr − k s )

From the condition dS pr = 0 we can obtain the following SI and SD yield curves as

f SI = ln(s I ) + c1 . (for SI)

(10)

f SD = ln(s D ) + c 2 . (for SD)

(11)

where c1 and c2 are integration constants.
For a given plastic change in Sr , the SI and SD curves can be drawn as shown in
Fig. 1. The SI curve AK is stems from Eq. (12), while the SD curve BL follows from
Eq. (13). The plastic volumetric strain ε pv is equivalent along the same LC yield
curve, with the plastic change in Sr being equivalent along the same SI curve or the
same SD curve. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1, there are six zones with different
yielding characteristics for ε pv and dS pr .
2.3 Formulation of the Elastoplastic Model for General Stress States

The Modified Cam-clay model has been used extensively for saturated soils, and
gives reasonably good predictions for clays. This model is adopted here because it is
simple. Assuming an associated flow rule, the yield function (f) and the plastic
potential function (g) are proposed to have the following form:
f = g = q'2 + M 2 p' (p'−p 'y ) = 0 .

(12)

The associated flow rule is obeyed in the ‘effective stress’ space; that is:
dε ijp = Λ

∂f
.
∂σ 'ij

(13)

where the proportionality constant Λ can be determined from the consistency
condition. Eq. (12) can be rewritten as f = f (p' , q' , p 'y ) = 0 , leading to:
df =

∂f
∂f
∂f
dp'+
dq'+ ' dp 'y = 0 .
∂p y
∂q'
∂p'

(14)

Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (14) and re-arranging gives:
df =

∂f

∂f ∂p y
dp'+
dq'+ '
dp 0 y + '
ds .
∂p'
∂q'
∂p y ∂p 0 y
∂p y ∂s

(15)

where the isotropic yielding stress p 0 y for saturated soil is related to the volumetric
strain ε pv and is the same as that used in the traditional Cam-clay model. Because the
plastic volumetric strain ε pv is a hardening parameter in the present model, the

volumetric plastic strains dε pv caused by dp 0 y in a saturated soil are the same as those
in an unsaturated soil which are caused by dp 'y and/or ds . Allowing for Eq. (13), the
following is obtained:
dp 0 y =

1+ e
1+ e
∂f
p 0 y dε pv =
p0y Λ
.
λ (0 ) − κ
λ (0 ) − κ

(16)

Substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (15) and solving for Λ gives:

Λ=−

∂p 'y ∂p 0 y
λ(0) − κ ∂p'

(17)

From Eqs (13) and (17), it is possible to calculate the plastic strain increments caused
by the increment in the ‘effective stress’ and/or the decrement in suction.
Following the formulation in plasticity, the plastic increment of Sr is written as
dSpr = Λ α

∂f α
. ( α = SI, SD )
∂s

(18)

where Λ α are plastic multipliers. From Eqs (11) and (12), we have
∂f SI 1 ∂f SD 1
= ;
=
∂s s I

sD

(19)

Substituting Eq (19) into Eq (18) and then comparing with Eq (9) gives
Λ SI = Λ SD = (λ sr − κ s )ds

(20)

3 Model Predictions Versus Experimental Results
The model requires five parameters to describe the stress-strain behaviour
( λ(0), λ s , κ, p 'n and M) and three parameters to describe the water-retention behaviour
( λ sr , κ s and λ se ).
We have performed a series of triaxial tests on unsaturated Pearl clay with suction
control. Details of the Pearl clay properties, specimen preparation, and testing
procedure can be found in the previous works of Sun et al. [5], which provides
information about the stress-strain behaviour of Pearl clay, but do not give details of
the measured water-retention behaviour. These are given below together with the
model predictions. The model parameters for compacted Pearl clay are as follows:
λ(0) = 0.12, κ = 0.03, λ s = 0.12, p 'n = 2MPa , M = 1.15 and λ se = 0.35, λ sr = 0.1, κ s = 0.01 .

Figure 3 shows predicted and measured results of isotropic compression, triaxial
shear and wetting tests. The stress paths consist of CC’D (isotropic compression with
constant suction s of 147kPa), DE (triaxial compression with constant mean net stress
p of 196kPa and s=147kPa), EF (wetting from s=147kPa to 0kPa under p=196kPa and
principal stress ratio of 2.0), and FG (triaxial compression under p=196kPa and
s=0kPa). It can be seen the model predicts well not only the stress-strain relationship
but also hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated compacted clay.

saturation (Sr0) at the beginning of triaxial shear tests. The measured stress-strain
relationship and strength are different due to different degrees of saturation before
loading even if the initial density and imposed net stress path and suction are the
same. Hence, the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils depend not only the net
stress and suction but also the degree of saturation. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that our
model can predict the unsaturated soil behaviour.

4 Concluding Remarks
A coupled elastoplastic constitutive model is proposed for predicting the hydraulic
and stress-strain-strength behaviour of unsaturated soils, and the predicted and
measured results of triaxial tests were compared to validate the model.
