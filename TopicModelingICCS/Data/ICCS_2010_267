Abstract
The wind climate measured in a point is usually described as the result of a regional wind climate forced by local effects derived
from topography, roughness and obstacles in the surrounding area. This paper presents a method that allows to use fuzzy logic to
generate the local wind conditions caused by these geographic elements. The fuzzy systems proposed in this work are specifically
designed to modify a regional wind frequency rose attending to the terrain slopes in each direction. In order to optimize these
fuzzy systems, Genetic Algorithms will act improving an initial population and, eventually, selecting the one which produce the
best approximation to the real measurements.

1. Introduction
The knowledge of the wind resources available in a selected area is fundamental to evaluate the possible
installation of wind turbines destined to produce electrical energy. The models used in these evaluations needs high
requirements to work and vagueness in terrain descriptions or errors in measurements affect considerably the
reliability of the simulation. Hence the majority of information registered in a studied area, from stations destined to
agriculture, fire detection or pollution, will be rejected to be used in these estimations because of their low quality. A
fuzzy wind model could be able to use all these excluded data reducing the requirements (and therefore the time and
the costs) of the wind resource prospection.
The most of the numerous works that describe a mesoscalar wind potential evaluation in different areas of the
world summarize the wind measured at the stations giving a general view of the wind conditions [1][2]. When a
higher reliability is needed, the study is normally based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) [3][4]. CFD solves
the fluid mechanic equations over a terrain with high computational cost (especially in this scale), and losing certainty
when complex geography and chaotic dynamic arises. So, these estimations are slow and expensive.
Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Networks and other adaptive tools are statistical structures able to work with low
requirements and high tolerance to possible errors [5]. Thus, using these techniques in the wind resource assessment,
the data quality could be replaced with data quantity and the deterministic prediction with a probabilistic one, more in
line with the atmospheric dynamic[6][7]. The references [14] and [15] describe wind problems in which Genetic
Fuzzy Learning is used, but focused on temporal prediction and without considering geographic elements. In this

paper, Genetic Fuzzy Learning will be used to develop a fuzzy system able to transform a regional wind climate into a
local one attending to basic aspects of the surrounding topography.

2. Location and wind data
To illustrate this paper, measurements from a net of meteorological stations have been acquired. These stations are
focused on agricultural parameters, so their locations and instruments are not optimized to the wind resource
estimation. As it is shown in figure 3, the selected station is located at Jimena (Andalucia, Spain), immersed in a
complex terrain. The other three neighbor stations, with similar characteristics, have been collected to build a regional
wind climate.

3. Regional wind climate
The regional wind climate, which will be forced by the terrain conditions, is generated as a linear combination of
real data registered at the stations around Jimena. This combination is based in interpolation functions for
geostatistics variables (defined by G. Matheron in [8]), and its application to Atmospheric Sciences suggested by
Thiebaux and Pedder [9]. Zekay Sen [10] have used these works to calculate the monthly mean wind speed in
different areas in Turkey obtaining good results.
In this paper these techniques are used to generate a wind frequency rose calculating wind vectors in a point
(vjimena) as linear combination of real wind vectors recorded at the three stations mentioned before (v1, v2, v3):

r
r
r
r
v jimena = a1v1 + a 2 v 2 + a 3 v3

(1)

The coefficients ai are normalized and indicate the contribution of each station to the final result. These
coefficients will be calculated using studied geostatistic weighting functions and normalizing:

ai =

W (ri )
¦ W (r j )

(2)

j

Where ri represents the distance between Jimena and the ith station, and W(ri) is the weight function which
adopts this form (Thiebaux and Pedder):

­§ R 2 − r 2 ·α
i
°¨
¸
W (ri ) = ®¨ R 2 + r 2 ¸
i ¹
©
° 0
¯

ri < R

(3)

ri > R

The parameter Į can be changed in order to modulate the distribution, and R is the radius of action beyond that
the evaluated point does not contribute. The values of these parameters (R=50 Km, Į=2) have been selected
according with A. Agüera et al[9]. In this last work, it is possible to find detailed information of the interpolation
system used here.
The result of this process is a temporal serie of wind vectors created with real information of the area. This serie
can be analyzed in order to test the accuracy of the prediction. In figure 1 the real wind frequency rose at Jimena is
compared with the rose of the regional wind climate generated by linear combinations of data from stations of the
area.

Fig. 1 and 2. Real and predicted wind frequency roses at Jimena. Distribution of real measurements in each direction when the regional wind
climate indicates E and W.

As it is possible to see, the regional wind rose builded with this method gives an important aproximation of the
real wind measured at the meteorological station of Jimena. But, in spite of this general similarity, there is an
important difference when the expected incoming direction is E and the station measures SE. This is due to the
linear interpolation predicts a theoretical wind whithout information of topography, roughness, obstacles, etc.
However, the wind measured in a point is affected by local conditions and these effects may be evaluated in order to
get a better prediction.
Analysing the real and the regional time series, it is possible to extract a more detailed description of the wind
direction errors. In figure 2 it is shown the distribution of real measurements from Jimena those days when the
regional wind indicates E and W. It is clearly visible how the directions expected as E are displaced to SE (even W),
in opposition to the W with low deviations from the prediction. In this paper we will consider that the regional wind
is dispersed by local topography producing the observed distribution of occurrence. So fuzzy systems will be used to
transform the regional wind distribution into the real one evaluating relief parameters.
To achieve this objective, the geographical information must be processed and inserted in a matrix builded as it is
shown in the following section.

4. Terrain
In figure 3 is represented the process through which an altimetric map image is transformed in the matrix used as
terrain input in this model. In the altimetric image each colour is associated to a height above sea level. Then,
reading the RGB components of each pixel, a height matrix of the area can be created and represented (figure 3a).
The wind measured in a point could be defined as a vector whith module and direction equal to wind speed and
wind direction. Hence, the simmetry of this problem is radial and input arguments should be expressed in polar
coordinates. Figure 3b shows the mean heights of the digitized area, fractioned in sectors (Mij) depending on the
polar coordinates relatives to the central point (Jimena).
Each Mij is obtained as the mean height of the n pixels inside the ij-sector (1):

M ij =

Fig. 3. Area of Jimena and transformations to obtain the model terrain input from a map image.

The matrix M, composed of Mij, is represented in Figure 3c. As it is shown in the graphic explanation below,
each column contains information of one direction. So a turn in the wind direction will be interpreted as a
displacement in x-axis. M gives an usefull representation of the physical geography around the calculation point,
adapted to the simmetry of the problem, and it is easily applied as input of fuzzy systems.

5. Genetic fuzzy system
The fuzzy system used in this problem pretends to connect the local wind conditions with terrain characteristics of
the area. The vagueness in the terrain description in this scale, the quality of data recorded at the used stations, and the
chaotic dynamics inherent to atmospheric events demand a fuzzy treatment of these elements. The proposed system
will calculate the probability of possible changes in the direction of the wind analyzing the terrain in those directions.
In order to simplify the problem only two inputs parameters will be proposed: the terrain will be described
considering the “slope” and the wind behavior will be represented by a “deviation” in the incoming direction. In the
same way, the output parameter will be represented by “probability”. References [12][13] are fundamental
bibliography to understand and study in depth the concepts used in this section.

5.1. Fuzzy sets
Fuzzy Logic is based on the fuzzification of crisp variables obtaining fuzzy sets, so linguistic terms are generally
used to build the new description. Each fuzzy set is defined in a domain and it is characterized by a membership
function with values between 0 and 1 which indicates de degree of membership of an element to the concerned fuzzy
set. For example, a fuzzyfication of the parameter “slope”, defined as the difference of heights between two relief
elements in the range [-500m, 500m], could be done using these fuzzy sets [down, plain, up]. So the parameter
“slope” could be fuzzyficated as it is shown in Figure 4. In this figure is also represented a possible election of fuzzy
sets for the parameter “deviation” ,[low, medium, high], defined between 0 and 22.5 degrees. “Probability”, whith
range [0, 1] will be divided with three sets [low, medium, high].

5.2. Fuzzy rules
Using these fuzzy sets it is possible to to build “IF-THEN” rules connecting the inputs with the output generating a
knowledge base. For example:
IF “deviation” is high and “slope” is up THEN “probability” is low.
Now it is possible to map crisp input values into output ones by using the processes of fuzzyfication, fuzzy
inference and defuzzyfication. So, the fuzzy systems used in this work can be represented as follow:

p = fuzz ( s, d )

(5)

Where s and d are the input values, p is the output and fuzz represents the processes of fuzzyfication and inference.

The membership functions, and fuzzy rules could be defined and adjusted by a human expert or founded using
statistical tools. In this paper we will try to optimize the fuzzy system with Genetic Algorithms (GA). So, we must
encode the fuzzy system characteristics into a string of values which will be considered a genome of this system.
Mutation and Crossover operators can act on this strings generating new fuzzy systems; and a selection operator can

select individuals according to the values obtained from a fitness function or objective. The action of these operators
brings an iterative process through which an initial population of fuzzy systems could be improved in order to obtain
the best fitness value.
We have chosen 22 parameters (genes) to characterize each fuzzy system. Eight of them are connected with the
position and shape of the memberships functions; so, they are continuous. The other ones are discrete variables used
to build the fuzzy rules of the system (Table 1).

5.4. Fitness function
The prove suggested to rank the fuzzy systems involves the modification of the regional frequency rose by
interaction with M, the matrix which contains the processed information of the map (Figure 4 c). This correction of
the regional rose will be done using an iterative process which simulates the wind flowing over the matrix M from
the bottom up. In each step the fuzzy system has to distribute the wind frequency in a selected direction (F) over the
five upper elements attending to the slopes and possible deviations as figure 5 shows. The iteration of this process
generates diagrams, like the one shown in figure 7, where probabilistic trajectories induced by the fuzzy system are
represented, and the output distribution could be considered a corrected rose obtained from the regional one after the
interaction with the topographic elements.

Figure 5. Corrections of directions using the fuzzy system, where “Inc” indicates the incoming direction, si and pi the slope and probability in
each direction. The deviations affect the five upper elements because, according to the fuzzy sets defined before, deviations are limited to 22.5º,
and consecutive elements in a row represent deviations of 11.25º

Once the corrected rose is obtained, it will be compared with the real one evaluating the mean absolute error
(MAE) in each direction:
16

MAE =

¦ FR

j

− FS j

j =1

16

(6)

Where FR represents the real frequencies measured at Jimena, FS the simulated ones and j is a parameter that
covers the 16 sectors of the roses. MAE value will be used as a fitness value to rank the fuzzy systems.
6. Results
After the action of Genetic Algorithms, an optimized fuzzy system have been obtained. The correction of the
probability distribution given by this fuzzy system is shown in figure 6. The MAE value obtained with this
distribution is 2.35% that improve the 4.29% associated to the regional rose.

As it was expected, the probabilistic trajectories simulated by the trained fuzzy system (Figure 7) describe a strong
modification in the winds from E displaced to the S, in opposition to the ones from the W which are smoothly
modified. These corrections are derived from the action of fuzzy rules and fuzzy sets summarized in table 2 and

The inference surface builded with this information is showed in figure 9, where slope and deviation are connected
to the output (probability, gray scale). The fuzzy system associates the highest probability to medium deviations when
the slope is smoothly negative. Turns higher than 20º and positive and strongly negative slopes are not favored.
Another minor effect observed is that wind tolerates a wider range of slopes while flowing in the same direction, that
is, deviation 0º.

7. Conclusions and future work
The fundamental conclusion of this work is that the described process presents a way to train fuzzy systems in
wind parameters downscaling. It is clearly visible the improvement of the obtained wind frequency distribution with
regard to the regional one. This fact implies that the optimized fuzzy system contains information about how to
correct the wind direction over Jimena using the terrain slopes. This acquired knowledge is the best statistical solution
founded through Genetic Fuzzy Learning according to the variables and conditions imposed to solve this particular
problem in this location.
But the ultimate objective of this technique should be the development of a generalized fuzzy system able to work
in many enviroments and expanded to correct the wind speed, the most important variable in wind resource
evaluation. In order to get the best agreement, this system should evaluate more terrain characteristics as roughness,
heights and distances from obstacles to the target point, topographic complexity, etc. Despite this parameter inclusion,
this new extended problem is essentially similar to the one described in this paper. The differences are related to the
number of inputs and outputs of the fuzzy system and the number and characteristics of the terrains used in the
training process.
Since fuzzy logic is able to work with vague data, an interesting application of this technique lies in training fuzzy
systems to work with low quality stations. In fact, the stations used in this study can be considered poor, because wind
vanes and anemometers are placed at 2 meters above ground level and reported data could be affected by obstacles
and roughness. Another problem is that the frequency of the provided mean wind speed and direction is daily, far
from the recommended ten-minutes interval. In opposition to these inconvenients, the use of this information allows
to acquire easily a considerable quantity of long term time series of real measurements of the area. So, once this
general fuzzy system is obtained, the duration and requirements of the wind resource evaluation of large areas could
be strongly reduced.
Finally, the technique exposed could be also applied to all that processes in which wind and terrain are closely
relationed as fire propagation or erosion.
