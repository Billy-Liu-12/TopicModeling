Abstract
Modeling of fluid mechanics for the vascular system is of great value as a source of knowledge about
development, progression, and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Full three-dimensional simulation
of blood flow in the whole human body is a hard computational problem. We discuss parallel
decomposition of blood flow simulation as a graph partitioning problem. The detailed model of full
human arterial tree and some simpler geometries are discussed. The effectiveness of coarse-graining as
well as pure spectral approaches is studied. Published data can be useful for development of parallel
hemodynamic applications as well as for estimation of their effectiveness and scalability.
Keywords: hemodynamics, vascular net, scalability, graph partitioning, coarse-graining, spectral methods, hillclimbing

1 Introduction
Computational modelling is being increasingly used for biomedicine applications (Winslow,
Miller, 2012). One important set of applications is modelling the heart and the vascular system
(Wootton, 1999; Taylor, 2004). Many highly advanced examples, which are at the same time close to
clinical practice, related to the development, progression, and treatment of cardiovascular disease can
be found among them (Tarbell, 2003; Vieira, 2015). The key role of fluid mechanics for vascular
system models renders computational hemodynamics a vast and growing field (Sforza, 2009; Taylor,
2013). Many biologically significant features of blood flow cannot be reproduced by approximated
hemodynamic models (Reymond, 2013) and full 3D blood flow simulations are required. Possible
restrictions on the time of solving in some medical applications make modelling of the heart and
vascular system an advanced computational problem. Building multiscale models (Lee, 2012) can be a
possible way of improving computational efficiency, however, on the other hand, since the particular

task of simulating blood flow can be considered as a problem of PFLOPS scale (Grinberg, 2012),
effective use of parallel computational resources becomes a critical part of the problem.
Blood flow modelling is different from many conventional hydrodynamics simulations in the sense
that the flow domain is often very complex, that is, highly tortuous with many branches and several
inlets and outlets. A space decomposition of hydrodynamics problem on such complex domain can
results in a very suboptimal configuration with high communication costs and load imbalances. This
happens even for relatively simple flow domains like aneurisms (Chopard et al., 2010), and for a fullbody model the result should be even worse. For aneurisms though, covering the flow domain with
cubic block structure can result in a rather good partition. However, heterogeneity of whole-body
networks makes this approach futile.
In this study we discuss the formulation of the problem of parallel decomposition of blood flow
simulation domain as graph partitioning problem. We reduce the 3D mesh of vascular system to 1D
network, which is then interpreted as a graph, partitioned in a way that minimizes communication and
assigned to the processors to compute blood dynamics.

The problem of graph partitioning is a well known. Theoretically it is itself an NP-complete
problem (Garey et al, 1976). However, a lot of heuristic algorithms which show reasonably good
results on many graphs from different real-life domains were suggested and applied (Safro et al, 2012;
LaSalle et al, 2015; Karypis et al, 1988). Some major types of partitioning methods can be
distinguished (Buluç, 2013).
The main approaches are coarse-graining the graph to solve the partitioning problem for a smaller
number of nodes and then refine it (Safro et al, 2012; Karypis et al, 1988); geometrical methods,
which split the graph according to spatial coordinates of the nodes (if such coordinates exist) (Gilbert
et al, 2007); spectral methods, which are often used as an intermediate step of coarse-grained schemes;
and genetic algorithms (Steenbeek et al, 1998). Some attempts are made to utilize max-flow min-cut
theorem to find minimal cut via flow. This approach ignores balance completely, but it can produce
good results for regular random graphs (Bui et al, 1987). Also, for some classes, for example planar
graphs, exact solutions can be found in polynomial time (Seidel, 2005).
All methods are well represented in studies and the features of applying them to various types of
graph are known in general. Despite that, we believe that the issue of partitioning the arterial network
has to be considered separately. First of all, the graph based on 1D arterial network has some
noticeable features, which cannot be recognized using the common characteristics of graphs such as
average degree of vertex, centrality, diameter and etc. While the effectiveness of partition algorithms
for various types of graphs is usually classified by these characteristics (LaSalle et al, 2015),
extrapolation of these results to the arterial graph is hardly possible. Additionally the common major
objectives of developing partitioning algorithms are different from ours. Whereas the performance and
parallelization of algorithms is often critical (Benlic, 2011; LaSalle, Karypis, 2015), our graphs are
small enough (thousands of vertices) to neglect this issue. Quality of partitioning and its imbalance, on
the other hand, are absolutely critical for the obtainable parallel effectiveness of the hypothetical
calculation performance.
We apply graph partitioning techniques to anatomical arterial structures to obtain balanced
partitions with minimal interconnections. In biomedical disciplines, the graph partitioning problem
usually comes up in the context of image recognition and area detection (see for example (Song et al.,
2015; Almasi et al., 2014)). When vascular trees have to be partitioned for various purposes, it is
usually done by hand or semi-automatically, based on anatomical classification (Malossi et al, 2012;
Passerini et al, 2009; Reymond et al, 2009). We aren't aware of any systematic studies of automatic
partitioning of large vascular trees.

However, the wide and well studied range of graph partitioning methods allows us to choose some
of the most effective among them with the account to the main features of the vascular network. Thus
we assume three main features of the considered network: global symmetry (left-right), strong
heterogeneity of scales (compare vascular networks in the thigh and in the brain), and weak
connectivity. Heterogeneity and hierarchy of scales suggest that using the coarse-graining (CG)
approach is a sensible choice. We consider a typical but recent coarsening scheme suggested by Safro
et al. (Safro et al, 2014). Spectral partitioning methods look more suitable for our problem (Mohar,
1991; Spielman, Teng, 2007) than geometric ones (Gilbert et al, 2007) since general symmetry and
hierarchy can be taken into account in spectral approach. The refinement hill-scanning method
(LaSalle, 2015) was chosen because it is a recent and deterministic algorithm which makes analysis
easier. Additionally, a clearly adjustable level of greediness is desirable for applying it to weakly
connected graphs.

partitioning on 8 parts is illustrated by color

3 Methodology
3.1 One-dimension representation of vascular networks
The vessel geometry was obtained from anatomical three-dimension networks. The base model
was taken from (Karsakov, 2014). In these networks, first the centerline was detected, and then the
vertices were placed on this geometry to split it into fragments suitable for computing the flow. The
size of the fragments was aligned. It can be noted that results of decomposition of such linear
geometry can be used for 1D approaches as well as for 3D calculations. Volumetric domains are
obtained by inverse transform procedure for centerline model.
We have used three different vascular domains for our computations: a high-resolution whole body
network (HRWB) of 21312 vertices, a low-resolution whole body network (LRWB), 2129 vertices,
and a high-resolution head and neck vessels (HRH), 3278 vertices. The models are shown in Figure 1.
For HRWB the distance between vertices of the graph equals 2.5 mm, for LRWB the same distance is
979

10 mm. The high-resolution whole body network is a highly heterogeneous domain with hierarchical
structure which includes complex clusters of small arteries (like for the head) connected by small
number of large arteries (such as the aorta). It reduces the amount of effective cuts (with small
edgecut) and presents the challenge to a partitioning algorithm. For comparison, we separately use the
head vessels, which have a much smaller scale difference between them. Also, the simplified whole
body model has been tested. First, this model brings us closer to the current whole-body flow
simulations (Mynard, 2008) which do not model small vessels explicitly. Second, the scale of the
vessels is even more uniform for this geometry than for the high-resolution head model, and third, the
low-resolution geometry serves well to demonstrate and analyze regions that cause most problems for
partitioning algorithms.

3.2 Algorithms
Since multi-step heuristic algorithms seem to be the most effective, we explore three typical levels
of such algorithms. For coarse-graining we use a single recent method, which is based on utilizing the
Galerkin operator (Safro et al., 2014). Two main ideas that cause this coarsening algorithm to yield
good results are: the AMG approach, which works well with complex graphs, which are placed in the
second and the third sets; a specific way to calculate connectivity strength between nodes, that leads to
better quality of partitioning at the cost of increased running time (Safro et al., 2014; Ron et al, 2011).
The CG algorithm we use has following parameters. Parameters of algebraic distance calculation
factor in relaxation matrix formula α=0.5, count of test vectors R=5, count of relaxation iterations
k = 20. Another parameter relates to the AMG part of the algorithm and denotes coupling strength
߆ = 0.5. The imbalance factor is ߳ ൌ ͲǤͲ͵(Safro et al., 2014).
For the second stage, two different spectral methods were used.
The basic spectral algorithm consists of computing the discrete graph Laplacian L, 2nd-smallest
eigenvalue of L and its associated eigenvector f (Fiedler vector). The graph is split so that the vertices
associated with small values in f are in one part, and those associated with large values are in another
one (Mohar, 1991; Spielman, Teng, 2007). The median value in f was chosen as the splitter, so that the
resulting parts were balanced.
This algorithm can only split the network in two parts. It can be extended to obtain a larger amount
of parts in two different ways.
Cascade partitioning is the first one. Its idea is to apply spectral bisection recursively to each part
produced by the previous iteration, until the required amount of parts is obtained.
The second one is a generalization of spectral octasection (Hendrickson, Leland, 1995). Instead of
using the Fiedler vector, this algorithm uses the k eigenvectors corresponding to k smallest eigenvalues
(starting from the 2nd-smallest) to assign the vertices to 2k parts. The drawback of this method is that
we cannot use the eigenvector coordinates directly. Instead, to optimally assign the vertices to 2 k parts,
we have to solve a minimal cost assignment problem in k-dimensional space (Tokuyama, Nakano,
1991). The strength of this algorithm is that it assigns all vertices in one iteration.
The last step is the refinement of the coarse splitting. One of the most recent algorithms is given by
(LaSalle et al, 2015) and was chosen for being deterministic and its ability to regulate its greediness.
This approach allows for breaking out of local minima by moving vertices that increase the edgecut
(weight of the edges that connect different parts of the graph) on their own, but decrease it when these
vertices are moved as a whole. This capability is known as hill-climbing. The capabilities of the
chosen algorithm are depicted in Figure 2. Case (a) is a result of partitioning of low-resolution whole
body network by cascade spectral algorithm before refinement. Fourth part is located mostly in legs
(isn't shown) and is colored green. The "bad" part of it is clearly visible on the right side of the chest,
but is fully corrected by the refinement procedure.

4 Calculations
Some combinations of the listed algorithms were used for computational experiments. The special
notation used for their designation is described here. The coarse-grain procedure is denoted by CG-X,
where X is the maximum number of CG blocks (the real number is usually a little lower). The
algorithm based on spectral octasection is denoted by SO-Y, where Y is the number of parts. Due to the
restriction of the partition procedures Y equals to 2k, where k is a natural number. Cascade spectral
partition procedure is denoted by CAS-Y, and RF denotes the refinement procedure. Thus, for
example, the combination CG-512 CAS-32 RF means that the original vascular network was coarsegrained with the upper bound of 512coarse-grained vertices, divided into 32 parts and then the
refinement procedure was applied.

5 Discussion
First of all we can determine the general behaviour of the partitioning procedures in dependence on
the number of partitions andthe average partition size. Figures 3 a) and b) show the standard deviation
of the average partition size and the average edgecut as functions of the number of partitions. We can
note the decreasing trend in the edgecut and assume that it approaches the average degree of a vertex
as the number of partitions increases and approaches the number of vertices (see additionally Tables 6
and 8). In our case, many vertices lie on linear sites (without bifurcations) of the arterial network, so
the average degree of a vertex is close to 2. The dynamic of the standard deviation of the average
partition size has aneven more interesting appearance. There is a maximum average size of a partition
(~ 300 vertices for HRWB, 50 vertices for HRH, 40 vertices or less for LRWB) after which the
unbalance of partitions decreases.
Based on the obtained data an analysis of each implemented algorithm can be conducted. For the
pure partitioning without final refinement we can notice some benefit of the cascade partitioning
algorithm in spite of our expectations. For example, compare CG-512 SO-64 and CG-512 CAS-64 on
the HRH model, or CAS-64 and CG-512 SO-64. The benefit of cascade approach is not so definite for
the case of the HRWB model, where heterogeneity of scales is stronger. SO algorithm produces better
balance especially for small partitions (CG-2048 SO-256, CG-2048 SO-128), while cascade approach,
on the other hand, minimizes the edgecut value.
The results of applying the refinement procedure are of special interest. It turns out that the
refinement stage is critically important for the quality of the final partitioning and all noticed features
of CAS and SO procedures become rather negligible after the refinement step. In most cases, the RF
procedure trades the balance of the partition for a decrease in edgecut, especially if the initial
partitioning was good. However, we have found that thorough adjustment of RF parameters frequently
allows for an improvement in both of these characteristics (CG-512 CAS-64, CG-2048 SO-512 for
example). The depth of the search is the most important parameter for this (LaSalle et al., 2015).
The contribution of CG procedure to the final quality of the partition is not very clear. The
situation is complicated because a direct application of SO procedure without initial coarse-graining is
too computationally hard. For the case of cascade approach,comparing the Tables 3 and 4 on one hand
and Tables 6 and 7 on the other gives opposite outcomes. Anyway, there is no doubt about the
computational efficiency of the initial coarse-graining procedure.

6 Conclusions
In this paper we have presented the results of testing different partitioning schemes for real-life
vascular networks. We utilize three types of algorithms in the CG multistep partition approach: coarsegraining, partition, and refinement. Two spectral methods were implemented for partitioning. We have
shown that graph partitioning approach is applicable for these networks. Remarkable, that spectral
methods take in account the anatomical structure of vascular net, that is especially noticeable for
partitioning into a small amount of parts.
The cascade spectral method has turned out to produce slightly better results than the direct
method, but the refinement levels most of the differences. A combination of the cascade method with
refinement produces a slightly smaller cut, and the direct method results in slightly more balanced
partitions after refinement. It turns out that the refinement stage is critically important for the quality
of the partitioning. The effectiveness of the chosen refinement method (so called hill-climbing
approach) additionally was shown. Using the initial coarsening does not worsen the result, and in
some cases can even improve it.
The amount of inter-part edges per part decreases and approaches the average degree of a vertex
with the increase in the amount of parts. The dependency of the balance on the number of partitions is
interesting but intuitively clear too. The standard deviation has a maximum for some average value of
the partition size and decreases with further decrease of partition size. Generally a standard deviation
of 10% is typical for the number of vertices per part. Attempts to decrease this deviation lead to a fast
increase in connectivity.
Because of all this, one can presume a sublinear growth of communication expenses with the
increase in the number of processing cores, which makes the task of parallelizing whole-body flow
simulations a promising one.
