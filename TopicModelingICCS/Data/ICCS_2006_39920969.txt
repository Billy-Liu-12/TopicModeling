Abstract. In this paper, a simpliﬁed signal detection technique is proposed for V-BLAST systems. In this proposed scheme, since the performance of V-BLAST system depends on the ﬁrst sub-stream detection
capability, V probable streams are detected according to the ﬁrst detected sub-stream of DFE detector and most probable stream is selected
by likelihood test. And to reduce the computational complexity of DFE
detector, a simple DFE detection scheme is also proposed. It has been
shown that the proposed technique can detect the transmitted data more
accurately than conventional DFE decoding scheme, and has very lower
complexity than ML detector.

Introduction

Recently, there has been increasing interest in providing high quality and eﬃcient
broadband services over wireless and mobile links. One powerful performance
enhancing technique, which holds the promise of oﬀering signiﬁcant increase in
the system information capacity, is multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna technique [1]-[3]. Although current communication architectures such as
the Vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) have demonstrated
very high spectral eﬃciencies, they have not reached the available capacities. In
particular, there is a wide gap between the performance obtained by original
detection algorithm of V-BLAST and optimum performance algorithms [4]. In
general V-BLAST detection scheme which is called decision feedback equalization (DFE) or successive interference cancelation (SIC), since the performance
depends on initial layer detection capability [5], the accurate detection of ﬁrst
layer is very important to increase an overall system performance.
In this paper, for more accurate detection of initial layer, simpliﬁed ML detection technique with DFE detection is proposed. At the same time, to reduce
the computational quantity of the DFE detector we present simple DFE scheme
with Cholesky factorization.
This paper is organized as follows. After describing the system model, general
detection and proposed DFE detection is provided. Next, the proposed simpliﬁed
signal detection algorithm is addressed. Simulation results and conclusions are
ﬁnally showed.

System Description

We consider M transmit antennas and N ≥ M receive antennas. The data is
demultiplexed in M data layers of equal length. These layers are mapped into
certain modulation symbols. The layers are transmitted over the M transmit
antennas simultaneously.
Let x = [x1 x2 · · · xM ] denote the M × 1 vector of transmit symbols, then
the corresponding N × 1 receive signal vector is given by
r = Hx + n

(1)

where n is zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance σn2 and H = [h1 h2 · · · hN ]T
is an i.i.d random complex vector of multipath channel with each element of
hn = [hn1 hn2 · · · hnM ].

ML and DFE Detector
General ML and V-BLAST Detector

Under the assumption of channel state information (CSI) perfectly known by
the receiver, ML detection and decoding correspond to choosing the codeword
x which determines the symbol combination with the smallest distance metric
as a decision value as follows

Theoretically, ML detection would be the optimum way of recovering the transmitted data at the receiver. But as the computational eﬀort is of order LM in
L-QAM system, ML detection is not feasible for real time implementations [5].
Therefore, suboptimum detection schemes are generally used.
The representative and general detection scheme is ordered SIC (OSIC) detection scheme [2]. In the OSIC detector, the received signal vector r is multiplied
by ﬁlter matrix G which is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse denoted by (·)†
of the channel matrix [2]. The zero-forcing (ZF) Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse
matrix is
(3)
GZF = H† = (HH H)−1 HH .
And in the MMSE detector, minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between
the actually transmitted symbols and the output of a linear detector leads to
the ﬁlter matrix
(4)
GMMSE = (HH H + σn2 )−1 HH .
With the deﬁnition of a (M + N ) × M extended channel matrix H through
H=

the MMSE ﬁlter given by Eqn. (4) can be rewritten as follows [5]
GMMSE = (HH H)−1 HH .

(6)

Assume that sub-stream i yields the smallest estimation error or, equivalently,
the largest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after linear nulling of the interference. It
can be concluded that this sub-stream is associated with the row g(i) of G that
has minimum Euclidean norm, because this vector brings out the smallest noise
enhancement. So, during the ﬁrst step of the algorithm, only the decision static
xˆi = g(i) r = g(i) (Hx + n) = xi + ηi

(7)

ˆi for the transmit
with the eﬀective noise ηi = g(i) n is used to ﬁnd an estimate x
signal xi .
The interference caused by this signal is then subtracted from the receive
signal vector r and the i-th column is removed from the channel matrix, leading
to a new system with only M − 1 transmit antennas. This procedure consisting
of nulling and cancelling is repeated for the reduced system until all signals
are detected [2], [5]. In this procedure, the pseudo-inverse matrix calculation
of the channel matrix is required in every layer detection. For example, the VBLAST system with 8 transmit antennas requires 8 times pseudo-inverse matrix
calculations. Therefore, as the number of transmit antenna is increased, the
decoding complexity is highly increased. To reduce this high complexity, the
decomposition theory is applied in V-BLAST decoding.

Proposed DFE Detector with Cholesky Factorization

In this subsection, the sorted MMSE DFE detector with Cholesky factorization
is proposed.
Let R = HH H denote the cascade of H; since R is Hermitan, it possesses a
unique Cholesky factorization of the form R = DH D, where D is lower triangular with real diagonal elements. Multiplying the received signal r in Eqn. (1)
by the unitary matrix D−H HH yields [5]
z = D−H HH r = Dx + η

(8)

where η = D−H HH n.
The whole proposed DFE algorithm based on Cholsky factoriztion is described
as follows.
Step 1. The column of the channel matrix is sorted according to MMSE criterion
in Eqn. (4). In this step, the MMSE criterion calculates ||Gi ||2 in Eqn (4) for
i = 1, 2, · · · , M , sorts them from the largest to the smallest and saves the sorted
column index in sequence k, k = {k1 , k2 , · · · , kM }. Finally rearrange the columns
of H according to the sorted index sequence k
Hsort = [Hk1 Hk2 · · · HkM ]
where Hki is [H1,ki H2,ki · · · HN,ki ]T .

Step 2. The rearranged channel matrix Hsort in Eqn. (9) is extended to Hsort
and Cholesky factorization is executed as follows
H

sort Hsort = Rsort = D D.

(10)

Step 3. In extended D of Eqn. (10), the required part D which is M by M
matrix is picked and signal detection is executed as follows

In this process, the pseudo-inverse matrix calculation and sorting procedure
of channel matrix are required only once.

Simpliﬁed Signal Detection

The proposed ML technique consists of three steps. In ﬁrst step, V sub-streams
are detected, which are ﬁrst outputs of DFE detector. Next, V streams are
detected according to the detected V sub-streams in ﬁrst step. In this step,
the DFE decoding process is executed V times. In ﬁnal step, most probable
stream among V streams in second step is selected by likelihood test. The whole
algorithm is described as follows.
Step 1. Detecting V sub-streams at the ﬁrst detection order of sorted DFE
detector: The ﬁrst detected sub-stream of Eqn. (11) can be presented as follows
x
˜k1 = z1 /d1,1 = (d1,1 xk1 + η1 )/d1,1 ,

(12)

and V probable sub-streams are determined. It can be expressed as follows
ˆ k1 = Q(V ) (˜

xk1 ),

(13)

where Q(V ) (k) is decision function which determines V symbols of L-QAM or
L-PSK system (V ∈ L) by checking the Euclidean distance from k to each

(17)

Since this simpliﬁed ML technique considers only V candidate streams, much
lower complexity is need than that of conventional ML detection scheme.
The introduced ML detection technique can use any other DFE detector such
as OSIC and QR decomposition as well as the Proposed DFE detector.

Simulation Results and Discussions

To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, V-BLAST system with
QPSK modulation is considered. It is assumed that the receiver acquires the
perfect CSI.
Fig. 2 shows the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system with M =
N = 4. It can be seen that the proposed sorted ZF and MMSE DFE detectors with Cholesky factorization achieve the similar performance as the ZF and
MMSE SIC schemes, with signiﬁcantly lower complexity.

Fig. 3 shows the BER performance of the proposed technique with M = N = 3
according to the number of V . As expected, the more the number of V is adopted,
the better BER performance is acquired. In the case of V = 4, the performance
of proposed method can be dramatically improved due to reduction of error
propagation.

Fig. 4 illustrates the eﬀect of the number of transmit antennas on the BER

it can be easily observed that the performance of the proposed technique is
better than that of classical VBLAST detection and as the number of transmit
antennas is increased, the performance diﬀerences are larger due to the eﬃcient
diminution of noise enhancement.

Conclusions

Since the performance of V-BLAST system is limited by the ﬁrst detected substream due to error propagation, we propose the simpliﬁed ML detection technique which can detect the ﬁrst sub-stream more accurately. And to reduce

the complexity of sorted DFE detector, simpliﬁed DFE detector with Cholesky
factorization is presented. The proposed DFE detector achieves the similar performance as the conventional SIC scheme. Simulation results show that the performance of the V-BLAST system can be improved by adopting the proposed
ML detection technique, and the decoding complexity and system performance
can be controlled by adjusting the number of V .
