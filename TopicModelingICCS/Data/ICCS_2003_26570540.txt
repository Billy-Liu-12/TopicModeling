Abstract. In recent papers [7], [8], [9], [11] the technique for a local
and global errors estimation and the local-global step size control were
presented to solve both ordinary diﬀerential equations and semi-explicit
index 1 diﬀerential-algebraic systems by multistep methods with any
reasonable accuracy obtained automatically. Now we extend those results
to the concept of multistep extrapolation and demonstrate on numerical
examples how such methods work in practice.

Introduction

In [7] we presented a new procedure to control a step size for linear multistep
methods applied to semi-explicit index 1 diﬀerential-algebraic systems of the
form
(1a)
x (t) = g x(t), y(t), α(t) ,
y(t) = f x(t), y(t), α(t) ,

(1b)

x(t0 ) = x , y(t0 ) = y

where t ∈ [t0 , t0 + T ], x(t) ∈ Rm , y(t) ∈ Rn , α(t) ∈ Rl (α(t) is a known vector),
g : D ⊂ Rm+n+l → Rm , f : D ⊂ Rm+n+l → Rn , and where initial conditions (1c) are consistent; i.e., y 0 = f (x0 , y 0 , α(t0 )). In contrast to the standard
approach, the new error control mechanism was based on monitoring and controlling both the local error and the global error of multistep formulas. As a result,
such methods with the local-global step size control solve diﬀerential-algebraic
equations with any prescribed accuracy (up to round-oﬀ errors).
For implicit multistep methods, we gave the minimum number of both full
and modiﬁed Newton iterations allowing the iterative approximations to be
correctly used in the procedure of the local-global step size control. We also
discussed a validity of ﬁxed-point iterations for high accuracy solving index 1
diﬀerential-algebraic systems.
The only drawback of the local-global step size control was high execution
time for some test problems. It was a consequence of recomputing the numerical
solution as many times as the error control mechanism had required that. In

Extrapolated Multistep Methods and Local-Global Step Size Control

order to decrease the execution time, we developed a new advanced version of
the local-global step size control in [9] and [11]. We showed that this local-global
step size control is not only eﬀective, but it is also reliable in practice.
The conception of multistep extrapolation was presented for ordinary differential equations in [10]. Now we extend that approach in order to construct
an extrapolation process in the class of linear multistep methods for index 1
diﬀerential-algebraic systems. Such extrapolation methods give a way to increase
the order of an underlying multistep method without repeated integrations with
smaller step sizes. Another advantage of multistep extrapolation methods is
breaking the ﬁrst Dahlquist barrier [1] which imposes a restrictive limitation
on the order of stable multistep methods. For example, our procedure makes it
possible to increase the accuracy of Backward Diﬀerentiation Formulas (BDFs)
up to the 10-th order preserving their stability.

Local and Global Errors Estimation

In the rest of this paper we consider a diﬀerential-algebraic system (DAS) of the
form
x (t) = g x(t), y(t) ,
(2a)
y(t) = f x(t), y(t) ,
m

where t ∈ [0, T ], x(t) ∈ R , y(t) ∈ R , g : D ⊂ R
→R ,f :D⊂R
→
Rn , and where the initial conditions x(0) = x0 , y(0) = y 0 are consistent; i.e.,
y 0 = f (x0 , y 0 ). To solve problem (2) numerically, we introduce a nonuniform
grid wτ = {tk+1 = tk + τk , k = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1, t0 = 0, tK = T } on the interval
[0, T ] and deﬁne τ as the diameter of the grid wτ ; i.e., τ = max0≤k≤K−1 {τk } .
Having applied a stable linear l-step method to problem (2), we obtain the
following discrete problem:
l

(3b)

yk+1 = f (xk+1 , yk+1 ),

Here, we have used the indirect approach to construct multistep methods for
DASs and have taken into account that coeﬃcients of the underlying multistep
method may be variable [3], [4]. We consider the starting values xi and yi ,
i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1, to be known.
Further we assume that the underlying multistep formula is of order s and
problem (2) satisﬁes the following conditions on the compact set D1 ⊂ Rm+n :
I. The smoothness condition. The mapping G : D1 ⊂ Rm+n → Rm+n is sufﬁciently diﬀerentiable on the set D1 , where G is obtained by combining the
def
mappings g and f ; i.e., G = (g T , f T )T .
II. The nonsingularity condition. The matrix In − ∂y f (x, y) is nonsingular for
def

any z = (xT , y T )T ∈ D1 , where In is the identity matrix of dimension n, and
∂y f (x, y) denotes the partial derivative of mapping f with respect to y.

III. The inclusion condition1 . There exists a convex set D0 such that z 0 =
((x0 )T , (y 0 )T )T ∈ D0 ⊂ D1 .
If conditions I–III hold then problem (2) is of index 1 and it has a unique
T

def

solution z(t) = x(t)T , y(t)T
∈ D0 . Moreover, the ﬁxed-step size version of
method (3) is convergent and is of order s (for example, see [2]–[6]). Moreover,
the coeﬃcients ai (k), bi (k), i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1, and the step size ratios τk+1 /τk ,
k = l−1, l, . . . , K −1, have to be bounded, and |a0 (k)| ≥ a0 > 0 (a0 is a constant)
to insure convergence of variable-step size method (3). We further consider stable
multistep methods satisfying these conditions and require additionally only grids
wτ with any bounded step size rations; i.e., τi /τk , i, k = l − 1, l, . . . , K − 1.
It follows from the construction of multistep method (3) that its local truncation error at the point tk+1 is

By deﬁnition, if we put ∆zk+1−i = 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , l, in formula (5) and omit
the higher order terms we obtain the local error of method (3) with accuracy

high accuracy computation of the local error of multistep method (3). The only
problem is how to evaluate L tk+1 , z(t), τk at the grid nodes.
To do this, we expand the functions x(t) and x (t) in (4) in Taylor series at
the point tk+1 and use the deﬁnition of the order of variable-step size multistep
formulas (see, for example, [3]) to estimate an approximate value of the local

Finally, we must note that local error estimation (8) works correctly only if
the solution zk is improved in the course of numerical integration of DAS (2),
for example, as follows:

z˜k = zk + ∆˜

k = l, l + 1, . . . , K.

Actually, it is important to understand that in practice we can apply any appropriate way to get a numerical solution of problem (2) with the accuracy of
O(τ s+2 ).
Now we turn our attention to the global error estimation. Remember equation
(5) obtained for the error of method (3). Assuming further the errors of the
starting values ∆zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1, to be known and omitting the O(τ 2s )order terms in (5), we have the following recursion relation for an evaluation of
the real error of method (3) at the grid points:

It was shown above that having used the corrected values of approximate
solution z˜i , i = k + 1, k, . . . , k + 1 − l, we can ﬁnd L tk+1 , z(t), τk , which is
necessary for computing the vector ck in (9), with the accuracy of O(τ s+2 ) by
formula (7). Thus, formulas (8) and (9) give a way to estimate the principal
terms of the local and global errors of multistep method (3) for any grid wτ with
suﬃciently small diameter τ provided that the order of the underlying multistep
formula is s ≥ 3. More precisely, we derive the following:
Theorem 1 Let DAS (2) satisfy conditions I–III and the order of multistep
method (3) be s ≥ 3. Suppose that the starting values zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1,
are given with accuracy O(τ s+1 ), and the errors in the starting values ∆zi =
z(ti ) − zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1, are known with accuracy O(τ s+2 ). Then formulas
(8) and (9) give the principal terms of the local and global errors of method (3),
respectively, for any grid wτ with suﬃciently small diameter τ if the corrected
approximate solution
z˜k = zk + ∆zk ,

k = l, l + 1 . . . , K,

(10)

is used for the computation of both the local truncation error L tk+1 , z(t), τk
and the local error ∆˜
zk of method (3).
The proof of theorem 1 and full details concerning the local and global errors estimation can be found in [7]. The similar results for ordinary diﬀerential
equations are presented in [8].

Extrapolated Multistep Methods

Obviously, if we increase the accuracy of computation of the local truncation
error L tk+1 , z(t), τk formula (9) remains valid for a higher accuracy evaluation
of the error of multistep method (3). To provide this, we replace (7) with the following formula giving an estimate of L tk+1 , z(t), τk with accuracy O(τ s+q+2 ):

As above, the notation xk+1 means x-components of the (r+1)-order derivative of the approximate solution of problem (2) at the point tk+1 . Further we
suppose that

Then (5), (8) and (11) give the following:

numerical solution in the course of integration; i.e.,
z˜k+1 = zk+1 + ∆S−s+1 z˜k+1 ,

k = l − 1, l, . . . , K − 1.

(14)

In order to ﬁnd the necessary derivatives of the solution of problem (2) for
formula (11) and to provide condition (12) in iterative process (13), we suggest
to diﬀerentiate a suﬃciently high degree interpolation formula based on the
improved values of numerical solution (13a) and (14).
Theorem 3 Let DAS (2) satisfy conditions I–III. Suppose that the starting values zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1, of stable l-step method (3) are given with accuracy
O(τ s+1 ), and the errors in the starting values ∆zi = z(ti ) − zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1,
are known with accuracy O(τ S+2 ), 3 ≤ s ≤ S ≤ 2s − 3. Then, for any grid wτ
with suﬃciently small diameter τ formula (9) gives the global error of method
(3) with accuracy O(τ S+1 ) if the corrected numerical solution (10) has been used
in iterative process (13) for an evaluation of the local error.
Theorems 2 and 3 allow the error of any stable multistep method and the
numerical solution of DAS (2) to be calculated with accuracy O(τ 2s−2 ). The
latter implies, for example, that the accuracy of BDFs can be increased up to
order 10. Moreover, we conclude from the results mentioned above that the order
of any stable l-step method does not exceed 2l + 2 for even l and 2l for the odd
step number. Thus, we made weaker the ﬁrst Dahlquist barrier (compare with
[1], see also [3]).

Numerical Experiments

Let us now consider some numerical examples conﬁrming the theory presented
in the previous sections. To do this, me take the DAS
x1 (t) = 10t exp 5 y2 (t) − 1
1

y1 (t) = x1 (t) 5 ,

x2 (t),

x2 (t) = −2t ln y1 (t) ,
2

y2 (t) = x2 (t) + y2 (t)

/2

(15a)
(15b)

with the exact solution
x1 (t) = exp 5 sin(t2 ) ,
y1 (t) = exp sin(t2 ) ,

x2 (t) = cos(t2 ),
y2 (t) = sin(t2 ) + 1.

(16a)
(16b)

We will use the exact solution to determine and observe the actual order of
extrapolated multistep methods. Here, we also do not take into account roundoﬀ errors and apply (16) to compute the starting values with zero errors.
Now we construct extrapolation process (9), (10), (13) on the base of BDFs
of orders 4 and 6, for instance. To determine the real order of the multistep
extrapolation technique, we integrate numerically problem (15) on the interval
[0.3, 1.4] with ﬁxed step sizes τ . 5 diﬀerent step sizes are chosen for every extrapolation number q = 0, 1, 2 in the ﬁrst experiment and for q = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
in the second one. It follows from (16) that all the conditions of theorems 2, 3
hold for (15) on the interval [0.3, 1.4]. Then multistep extrapolation is applicable in this case. The only problem is a correct implementation of the suggested
extrapolated multistep methods because stable BDFs are implicit and algebraic
constrains (15b) are nonlinear.
In practice, one can apply Newton-type iterations to treat arising algebraic
systems, but any iterative method introduces an additional error that may inﬂuence the asymptotics of (9) and of (11), just making the extrapolation impossible. Thus, it is important to coordinate the iterative error with the accuracy
of formulas (9), (11).
We take further the full Newton method. The suﬃcient quantity of iterations
is obtained from the theoretical results presented in [7]. Of course, the modiﬁed
Newton method can be also implemented correctly. Looking now at Tables 1
and 2, we see the total correspondence of the theory and the practice. The new
extrapolation technique actually allows the accuracy of the fourth- and sixthorders BDFs to be increased up to orders 6 and 10, respectively3 .
When implementing extrapolated multistep methods to solve ordinary diﬀerential equations, one has to ﬁxed the number of simple (ﬁxed-point) or Newtontype (full and modiﬁed) iterations per grid point following the theoretical results
of paper [10].

Note that the round-oﬀ errors inﬂuence the numerical solution when the order of
the method is high and the step size is small

Local-Global Step Size Control

With a practical standpoint, the most important and diﬃcult question is the
error arising in real numerical computations. To treat automatically this problem for multistep methods applied to both diﬀerential equations and index 1
diﬀerential-algebraic ones, we presented the local-global step size control in [7],
[8]. If we now take l and g as limits for the local and global errors, respectively, and choose the maximum step size τ , then that algorithm can be given
as follows:
Step 1.
Step 2.

k := k + 1, M := 0, go to Step 2;

Step 13. Stop.
Here, we have assumed that the starting values zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1, are known
with suﬃciently high accuracy and, hence, their errors ∆zi , i = 0, 1, . . . , l − 1,
are expected to be zero. We refer to [7], [8] for the complete description of the
procedure of local and global errors control mechanism and for the numerical
examples showing its advantage over the classical (local) step size selection.
Another proﬁt of the new extrapolation technique is an ability to use the
high accuracy estimates of the local and global errors of the numerical solution
obtained by multistep methods to control a step size. This idea was implemented
in [9] and [11] to construct the advanced local-global step size control based on
a computation of the ﬁrst two principle terms of the local and global errors
expansions. There, we proved that the advanced version of step size control is
more eﬃcient and reliable then the standard one. Moreover, taking into account
the results presented above we can easily extend the advanced step size control
version to more terms from the asymptotic expansions of the local and global
errors of multistep methods, just making it better for practical usage.

Conclusion

In this paper we have introduced the conception of extrapolation technique in
the class of multistep methods for index 1 DAS. We have given the necessary
theory and shown how such methods work in practice. This technique is not only
useful for increasing the accuracy of numerical integration, but also to construct
stable multistep methods of higher order.
