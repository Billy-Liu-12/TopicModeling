Abstract. The dynamics of coupled 2D chaotic maps with time-delay
on a scalefree-tree is studied, with diﬀerent types of the collective behaviors already been reported for various values of coupling strength [1].
In this work we focus on the dynamics’ time-evolution at the coupling
strength of the stability threshold and examine the properties of the regularization process. The time-scales involved in the appearance of the
regular state and the periodic state are determined. We ﬁnd unexpected
regularity in the the system’s ﬁnal steady state: all the period values
turn out to be integer multiples of one among given numbers. Moreover,
the period value distribution follows a power-law with a slope of -2.24.
Keywords: complex networks, coupled maps systems, emergent behaviour, self-organization in complex systems.

Introduction

Complex networks are overwhelmingly present in nature: a variety of systems
from technology, biology or sociology can be seen as networks of interacting
units that behave collectively [2,3]. The paradigm of many basic elements that
generate complex emergent behavior by interacting through the network links
received a lot of attention as a convenient way to model complex systems.
Coupled Maps Systems (CMS) are networks of interacting dynamical systems (maps) that can be easily computationally modeled allowing the study of
complex phenomena like synchronization, self-organization or phase transitions
[4,5,6,7]. The emergent behavior of a CMS can be investigated in relation to
the architecture/topology of the network, type/strength of the coupling or the
properties of the uncoupled units, often representing a model of applicational
interest [8,9]. The discovery of intrinsic modularity of many naturally occurring
networks [10] triggered the investigations of the dynamical properties of small
graph structures (termed motifs) [11], and their role in the global behavior of
the network [12,13]. Recent works emphasized the physical importance of timedelayed coupling due to its ability to mimic the realistic network communication
[14,15]. Also, following the extensive studies of collective behavior in 1D CMS,
the relevance of still poorly explored case of 2D CMS was recently indicated
[16,1], having special relevance in the context of scalefree networks [2].

Dynamical Regularization in Scalefree-Trees

In the previous works [1,17] we studied the self-organization of coupled 2D
standard maps on scalefree trees and motifs investigating diﬀerent types of the
collective behavior in function of the network coupling strength. After transients, the CMS dynamics was found to have two main collective eﬀects: the
dynamical localization, acting at all non-zero coupling strengths that inhibits
the chaotic phase space diﬀusion, followed by the regularization acting at larger
coupling strengths that produces groups of quasi-periodic emergent orbits with
common oscillation properties. For speciﬁc coupling values the network interaction eventually turns the quasi-periodic orbits into the periodic orbits or even
more complex structures like strange attractors, some of which unexpectedly
appear to have characteristics of the strange non-chaotic attractors, generally
known to arise in the driven systems [18].
As we revealed, there exists a critical network coupling strength μc relatively
common for all scalefree-trees and motifs, at which the collective motion becomes
regular even after very short transient. In this work we will further examine the
dynamics at μc for a ﬁxed scalefree-tree. We will be concerned with the timeevolution of our CMS and the appearance of the collective eﬀects in function of
the initial conditions, seeking to reveal the relevant time-scales and the properties
of the ﬁnal emergent motion.
The paper is organized as follows: after deﬁning our CMS on a scalefree-tree
in the next Sect., we study its regularization process using the node-average
and the time-average orbit approach in the Sect. 3. In the Sect. 4 we study the
appearance and the properties of the emergent periodic states, and conclude
with the Sect. 5 outlining the results and discussing the open questions.

Coupled Map System Set-Up on a Scalefree Tree

A scalefree network with the tree topology is grown using the standard procedure
of preferential attachment [2] by 1 link/node for N = 1000 nodes. Every node is
assumed to be a dynamical system given by the Chirikov standard map:
x = x + y + ε sin(2πx)
y = y + ε sin(2πx).

[mod 1]

(1)

The nodes (i.e. dynamical systems) are interacting through the network links
by one-step time-delay diﬀerence in angle (x) coordinate so that a complete
time-step of the node [i] for our Coupled map system (CMS) is given by:
x[i]t+1 = (1 − μ)x [i]t +
y[i]t+1 = (1 − μ)y [i]t ,

μ
ki

j∈Ki (x[j]t

− x [i]t )

(2)

as in [1,17]. Here, ( ) denotes the next iterate of the (uncoupled) standard map
(1), t is the global discrete time and [i] indexes the nodes (ki being a node’s
degree). The update of each node is the sum of a contribution given by the
update of the node itself (the part) plus a coupling contribution given by the
sum of diﬀerences between the node’s x-value and the x-values of neighboring

nodes in the previous iteration (for motivation behind this coupling form, see [1]).
We set the standard map chaotic parameter to ε = 0.9 and study the dynamics
of CMS (2) on a ﬁxed scalefree-tree (visualized in Fig. 1b) for the ﬁxed network
coupling strength μc = 0.012. The μc -value corresponds to the initial stability
phase transition for this CMS with all the orbits becoming periodic after a
suﬃciently long transient, as shown in Fig. 1a for a shorter transient (see [1] for
details). As opposed to the previous works, the focus will be maintained on the
time-evolution of CMS (2) in relation to the initial conditions for a ﬁxed μc ,
rather then on the motion properties after transients for various μ-values.
We therefore investigate the time-sequence of 2 × N -dimensional vectors
{x[i]t , y[i]t } ,

i = 1, · · · , N

in function of the discrete time t ≥ 0. The initial conditions are set by randomly
selecting the values (x[i]t=0 , y[i]t=0 ) for each node [i] from (x, y) ∈ [0, 1]× [−1, 1].
Future iterations are computed according to (2) with the parameter constraints
described above. Updates of all the nodes are computed simultaneously for all the
network nodes. Besides considering the properties of a single node/single initial

by averaging over the tree’s nodes, over the initial conditions or over the timeevolution, as they can provide alternative qualitative/quantitative insights into
the time-evolution of the dynamics.

average orbit of (2). The initial chaotic cluster is divided into two smaller clusters
that shrink and eventually become a quasi-periodic orbit (in the sense of not repeating itself while being spatially localized) oscillating between the clusters, with
even and odd iterations belonging to the opposite clusters. The qualitative structure of this process is invariant under the change of the initial conditions.
We will use the clusterization of this motion to design a more quantitative
approach. Let us consider even and odd iterations of the node-average orbit

(ˆ
xt , yˆt )even and (ˆ
space from initially being mixed together, towards each forming a separate cluster that shrinks in size. The sum of cluster sizes divided by their distance gives a
good time-evolving measure of the motion’s ’regularity’; one expects this quantity to decrease with the time-evolution, eventually stabilizing at some small
value (or possibly zero). To that end we ﬁx a certain number of iterations τ
and coarse-grain the sequences by dividing them into intervals of length τ and
considering two sequences of clusters (given as points within each interval for
each sequence) instead. We compute the 2-dimensional standard deviations for
each pair of clusters σeven (T ) and σodd (T ), and measure the distance dc (T ) between their centers. These quantities depend on the coarse-grained discrete time
T given as the integer part of (t/τ ). We deﬁne Σ(T ):

T . In Fig. 3a we show the behavior of Σ(T ) for three diﬀerent sets of initial
conditions: for each plot there exist a critical time tc at which the node-average

dynamics suddenly ’regularizes’ into a stable steady state characterized by a
small Σ(T )-value that shows no further change with T . We term this collective
dynamical state as regular in the sense of constancy of Σ(T ) (Note: we use
the term ’regular’ only to make a clear distinction with the chaotic dynamics
preceding this state, while a discussion of the precise properties of regular state
will be given later). We emphasize that as this consideration is done using the
node-average orbit, the result is a global property of scalefree tree CMS (2). The
value of tc depends only on the initial conditions and it is given as the value of
T after which Σ(T ) remains constant.
In Fig. 3b we examine the distribution of tc -values over the initial conditions.
The distribution P (tc ) presents a log-normal tail with a prominent peak at tc ∼
=
2.79 × 105 iterations. Note that the value of tc is by construction independent
of the initial conditions and hence refers only to the network structure and the
coupling strength μc .
3.1

Properties of the Regular Dynamical State

The regular dynamics after tc is characterized by quasi-periodic oscillatory motion of each node between two clusters, in analogy with the node-average orbit.
All nodes however do not share the same clusters, but instead every node settles

to oscillate between a certain pair of clusters that are horizontally corresponding to each other as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Every node therefore belongs to one
group of nodes oscillating between a common pair of clusters with a phase space
organization as in Fig. 4a (see [1]). Let the time-average orbit of a node averaged
over the time-interval (t0 , t1 ) be deﬁned as:
(¯
x[i], y¯[i]) =

which is a single phase space point that represents the node’s average position
during that time interval. In Fig. 4b we show the distribution of y¯[i]-values for all
the nodes of a single regular state: sharp peaks indicate groups of nodes sharing
the same pairs of clusters and hence sharing the same y¯[i]-value. Note that there
are 11 pairs of horizontally linked clusters on Fig. 4a, in correspondence with
the 11 peaks visible in Fig. 4b. The symmetry properties of this distribution are
invariant to the changes of the initial conditions.

Properties of the Periodic Dynamical State

Further evolution of any regular state eventually generates periodic orbits on all
the tree’s nodes under the dynamics of CMS (2). This is the ﬁnal equilibrium
steady state of this system that undergoes no further changes, and will be called
the periodic state. While the regular state is deﬁned only qualitatively by the
constancy of Σ(T ), the periodic state is precisely deﬁned in terms of the periodicity of orbits on all the nodes. Group phase space organization of the nodes
and their common oscillation properties described earlier (¯
y [i]-values, see Fig. 4)
still remain, with the periodic orbits replacing the quasi-periodic ones.

We describe the appearance of a periodic state in Fig. 5a: at each τ = 1000
iterations we check for nodes with the periodic orbits (for periods up to π = 105 )
and report their number. As opposed to the case of a regular state (Fig. 3a),
the nature of the transition to a periodic state is not unique. As clear from
Fig. 5a besides a typical phase-transition (red), one can observe other phenomena
including a slowly evolving non-equilibrium steady state (light blue) that does
not reach an equilibrium state within 5 × 105 iterations (we analysed the states
of this sort concluding they do not reach equilibrium even within 107 iterations).
Note that a sort of double phase-transition is also possible (dark blue) as the
architecture of the tree may induce time scales into the regularization process.
in Fig. 1b shows a typical situation during the time-evolution: nodes achieve
periodic orbits starting from ones with lesser links away from the hub, but not
necessarily connected among them. Once the hub-node becomes periodic the
whole tree is in a dynamical equilibrium, but the path of this transition can be
diverse depending on the initial conditions.
4.1

Properties of the Periodic Dynamical State

The key property of a periodic state is that almost all the period values turn
out to be integer multiples of a given number. These base multiple numbers are
predominantly 240 (73% of initial conditions) or 48 (18% of initial conditions),
with others being 96, 480, 720 etc. This is illustrated in Fig. 5b where we show a
histogram of period values – almost all the nodes have periods that are multiples
of 240, with remaining nodes having periods multiples of 48. It is to be observed
that all the base multiple numbers mentioned above are all multiples of 48.
Furthermore, we computed the averaged distribution of period values (for 20
cases of multiples of 240) shown in Fig. 5c. The distribution exhibits a powerlaw tail with an exponent of about -2.24, for periods up to π = 106 .
These properties clearly indicate a presence of a self-organizational mechanism
behind the creation of the periodic state of CMS (2). The same base multiple

Dynamical Regularization in Scalefree-Trees

numbers are involved in cases of periodic states obtained for this CMS with
other μ-values, but with a diﬀerent ratio of their presence depending on the
initial conditions (generally, smaller the μ-value bigger the presence of larger
base multiple numbers). Note that the periodicity of mentioned node orbits
have no similarity with the periodic and quasi-periodic orbits known to exist
in standard map’s dynamics, as for this ε-value standard map shows only very
little isolated regularity (otherwise being strongly chaotic).

Conclusions

We examined the nature of the collective dynamics of CMS (2) with the ﬁxed
coupling parameters ε = 0.9 and μc = 0.012 realized on a scalefree-tree, in terms
of its time-evolution and the properties of its emerging dynamical states. We
showed that for all the initial conditions dynamics becomes regular (in the sense
deﬁned above) after a critical time tc . Also, for a majority of the initial conditions dynamics reaches a ﬁnal steady state characterized by the periodicity of
each node’s orbit. Curiously, almost all the period values happen to be integer
multiples of a given number that (depending on the initial conditions) varies
within a given set of numbers. Also, for the periodic states having the base multiple number 240 (the most frequent one), the period value distribution follows
a power-law with a tail slope of roughly -2.24.
Despite the oscillatory nature of emergent dynamics in many CMS known so
far (mainly 1D), period values structure of this sort does not seem to be observed
yet. We speculate that this self-organization feature might owe its origin to the
time delayed structure of the coupling, and the nature of the standard map: once
a node achieves a periodic orbit, its neighbours ought to do the same, inducing
the correlation in the period values.
Open questions include network organization of periodic states in terms of
period–node relationship, as well as investigation of the steady states of this CMS
realized with diﬀerent networks. It might be also interesting to study similar
CMS with time-delays that vary throughout the network in a way to model
a given naturally occurring behaviour. Of particular interest might also be the
investigation of the non-equilibrium steady state mentioned in Fig. 5a (light blue)
from a statistical point of view.
