Abstract. Workflow interoperability across enterprises boundaries presents a
significant challenge recently. Process-view provides a promising way to crossorganizational workflows design. A multi-agent system combined with Petri net
based process-view approach is proposed to facilitate cross-organizational
workflows management. Within this multi-agent system, a Petri net algebra
model and a character string mapping algorithm are proposed to automate the
mapping from a Petri net workflow model to a process-view workflow model;
the synchronization points are added to integrated process-view workflow
models to coordinate the execution of cross-organizational workflow instances.
Keywords: Cross-organizational workflows management; Process-view; Petri
net; Multi-agent system; Mapping.

1 Introduction
The existing Workflow Management Systems (WMS) are commonly developed for
stable and long-running business processes in individual enterprises, which are always
rigid and centralized. But in cross-organizational business collaboration, cooperative
processes are highly dynamic and the execution of collaborative activities are
distributed, the required WMS should support dynamic and flexible business
collaboration across enterprises boundaries while maintaining privacy and autonomy
of participant enterprises. Facilitating interoperability among existing WMS provides
a promising way for realizing efficient cross-organizational workflows collaboration,
which avoids spending time and cost on developing new WMS.
A process-view is an abstract process derived from an implemented base process
[1]. In the process-view approach, an enterprise can realize business processes
integration with various partner enterprises by reusing its internal processes, which
saves much time to remodeling. Our previous work [2] proposed a Petri net based
process-view approach for workflow modeling in virtual enterprises. This paper
proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) combined with the previous approach to
facilitate interoperability among existing WMS.

2 Background and Related Work
The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) has developed specifications to
enable interoperability between heterogeneous workflow systems [3]. W.M.P. van der
Aalst [4] adopted Petri net to model interorganizational workflow. Liu and Shen [1]
proposed an order-preserving process-view approach to business-to-business (B2B)
workflow interoperability. Martin A. et al [5] utilized Petri net refinement paradigm to
simplify the handling of complex and large-scale workflows. The MAS offers a
distributed and open platform architecture for dynamically changing systems. In this
paper, we propose a MAS combined with the Petri net based process-view approach
to manage cross-organizational workflows, which can automate the mapping from a
Petri net workflow model to a process-view workflow model and coordinate the
execution of cross-organizational workflow instances.

3 A MAS for Cross-Organizational Workflows Management
The MAS combined with Petri net based process-view approach (PVMAS) is
described in Fig. 1. It provides a mediator architecture to facilitate distributed WMS
interoperability.

3.1 Mapping Agent
The Mapping Agent automates the mapping from a Petri Net (PN) workflow model to
a Process-View (PV) workflow model. A PN algebra model is proposed to automate
the mapping.
Definition 1. A PN algebra model is a character string L consists of Pi, Aj, Tk, Lm, +,
-, *, /, [ ], ( ) and F, Where:
(1) Pi, Aj, Tk and Lm are the starting and ending characters representing base place,
abstract place, base transition and logic transition respectively, where i, j, k and
m are the sequence number;
(2) +, -, *, / represent the order structures of Or-Join, Or-Split, And-Join and AndSplit respectively;

214

P. Jiang et al.

(3) [ ] represents the Loop structure, the places and transitions included in it are
executed repeatedly;
(4) ( ) represents the parallel branch;
(5) F represents nothing.
The Mapping Agent can realize the automation of mapping by intelligently
processing character strings. We use “{ }” to denote the sub-models must be hidden.
Fig. 2 describes the mapping, and the mapping steps are as follows:
(1) Build the PN workflow model described in Fig. 2.(a);
(2) Get the corresponding PN algebra model L described in Fig. 2.(b);
(3) Select the sub-models needed to be hidden in the PN workflow model. In Fig.
2.(c), the sub-models {P02, T02, P03} and {T05, P06, T06, P07} surrounded by
curving dashed line are the selected ones;
(4) Add “{ }” to the PN algebra model to denote the selected sub-models, and get the
middle character string L` described in Fig. 2.(d);
(5) Process L` by character string mapping algorithm, the PN algebra model L`` of
the PV workflow model can be obtained described in Fig. 2.(e), in which submodels {P02-(T02P03)} and {[T05P06T06P07]} in L` are replaced by abstract
places A01 and A02 respectively;
(6) Get the PV workflow model from the character string L`` described in Fig. 2.(f).

The core of the character string mapping algorithm is graph reducing theory. The
main procedures of the character string mapping algorithm are as follows:
input >> PN1;
// Input initial character string
PN1 = find_nodes(PN1); // Find out all nodes
out_in_way(PN2);
// Search the split and join nodes

creat_graph(PN2);
combine_graph(PN1);

// Transform the character string to a matrix
// Replace the nodes needed to be hidden with necessary
abstract place nodes
insert_L( );
// Add some necessary logic transition nodes
ans = output_graph( ); // Transform the matrix into a character string
output(ans).
// Output the last character string
3.2 Local and Global Collaborative Agent
In order to coordinate the execution of cross-organizational workflow instances, we
designate the synchronization points (SP) in the integrated PV workflow models.
Definition 2. SP are some base transitions in integrated PV workflow models, which
can facilitate the exchange of workflow status information and the coordination of the
workflow progress among the corresponding workflow instances.
When the integrated PV workflow instance execute to SP, the SP will trigger the
Global Collaborative Agent to inquire the status information of corresponding PV
workflow instances from Local Collaborative Agents of participant enterprises. If
there exist some delayed or abnormal information, the responsible Local
Collaborative Agents will be triggered to synchronize the execution of corresponding
PN workflow instances of participant enterprises.

4 Conclusion
The PVMAS for cross-organizational workflows management has the following
advantages: Different WMS can finish a common business collaboratively across
enterprises boundaries and keep autonomy; enterprises can adopt different PV
workflow models mapped from the same PN workflow model to quickly construct
cross-organizational workflows.
Our future work will mainly address two themes. First, extending PN to Timed
Colored Petri Net (TCPN) to enhance the modeling ability of our system. Second,
developing the PVMAS and validating the availability of the system.
