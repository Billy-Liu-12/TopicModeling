Abstract
Mitigating human errors is a priority in the design of complex systems, especially through the
use of body area networks. This paper describes early developments of a dynamic data driven
platform to predict operator error and trigger appropriate intervention before the error happens.
Using a two-stage process, data was collected using several sensors (e.g., electroencephalography,
pupil dilation measures, and skin conductance) during an established protocol - the Stroop
test. The experimental design began with a relaxation period, 40 questions (congruent, then
incongruent) without a timer, a rest period followed by another two rounds of questions, but
under increased time pressure. Measures such as workload and engagement showed responses
consistent with what is expected for Stroop tests. Dynamic system analysis methods were then
used to analyze the raw data using principal components analysis and the least squares complex
exponential method. The results show that the algorithms have the potential to capture mental
states in a mathematical fashion, thus enabling the possibility of prediction.

operator error [18]. Causes for the human operator error are many. In a report for the TNO
Institute for Perception, Raaijmakers [19] discussed the impact of mental and physical stress
on human performance in decision-making situations, speciﬁcally for time critical decisions.
Raaijmakers argued, “ . . . eﬀects of various stressors (fatigue, sleep loss, time pressure, anxiety,
and cognitive strain) are shown to be task-dependent. At lower levels, fatigue and sleep loss
seem to be the most important stressors; at higher levels, the largest eﬀects are expected to be
time pressure and cognitive strain.” (p. 1).
This paper describes preliminary developments of a dynamic data driven platform to predict
operator error and trigger appropriate intervention before the error happens. Taking advantage
of the advances in commercial grade psychophysiological sensors such as electroencephalography
(EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and eye-tracking systems, a
human operator’s mental and physical states before, during, and after each cognitive activity
is captured in an android device which doubles as the server for a wireless body area network
(WBAN). Thus the operator becomes an integral part of the system through a brain computer
interface (BCI). The WBAN server assimilates and fuses data from multiple sensors and streams
it to a stress-intensity simulation model, which, in turn may trigger appropriate intervention.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: background literature is presented in Section 2,
Section 3 describes the methodology, Section 4 presents the preliminary results, Section 5
discusses approaches to raw data analysis; Section 6 presents the results and analysis; and
Section 7 concludes the paper.

Background Literature

By virtue of being human, it is understood that people will make errors [21]. The ﬁeld of aviation
has been the most prominent in developing methods for evaluating and preventing human error
through processes and protocols [13, 17]. In recent years, a number of interventions have been
developed to help mitigate human errors. In the automotive industry, new technologies have
been introduced that automatically slow vehicles down prior to rear-ending a car or potentially
hitting a pedestrian [6]. Such methods work through technologies embedded in physical systems.
Psychophysiological measurements provide a means for gathering data directly from people.
These data are physiological measurements that correspond to psychological states. EEG is a
common sensor that has been used in studies to predict future and present cognitive performance [20] and to develop a driver drowsiness monitoring system [12]. In [9] a body-mounted
system is developed to prioritize incoming data streams based on the user’s workload, which is
measured using EEG and ECG signals.
Recent advances in wireless communication and wearable devices have led to the development of wireless body-area networked systems. Fletcher et al. developed a wearable sensor
platform for integrating data from skin conductance and heart rate to monitor emotion and
behavior for clinical use. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy could be given automatically based on
bio-signals [11]. Choi et al. established a wearable mental stress monitoring system based on
heart rate, respiration, electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA) [5]. Kumar
et al. further introduced a mobile health system structure to recognize behaviors and deliver
timely interventions [15]. Although several studies have proposed wearable biosensor systems
to track stress or behavior, the method for preventing errors based on these measures is not
well-established.

Methodology
Subjects

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board on human investigation. A
total of ten adults volunteered to join the study after passing the prescreening and providing a
written consent form. The ﬁrst ﬁve participants completed initial characterization tests to help
reﬁne the experimental procedure. Only data from the second ﬁve participants (two women
and three men) who joined the formal study will be reported here.

3.2

Computer-Based Stroop Test

In order to record synchronized response times and biosignals, a computer-based Stroop test
developed on Qt 5.3 (Qt Project Housing, Norway) was used in the study (Figure 1). To make
the question colors easy to distinguish, only primary colors (red, blue, and green) were included,
which is consistent with established Stroop test protocols [7]. Moreover, participants used arrow
keys (left, down, and right) to answer questions. The setup was intuitive, so participants could
answer as quickly as possible when they ﬁgured out the answer. The result of each question
showed on the screen for 0.5 seconds. If the participant did not answer in time, a ”timeout”
warning was displayed and the answer was recorded as incorrect for that question.

3.3

Equipment

The main approach of this research is to develop a body area network to capture signals from
bio-sensors. In order to obtain holistic psychophysiological responses of participants during
decision making (and various kinds of cognitive activities), three types of sensors were used in
the proposed experiment. A B-Alert X10 EEG headset system (Advanced Brain Monitoring,
Inc., USA), a Shimmer3 GSR+ Unit (Shimmer, USA), and a Tobii X60 eye tracker (Tobii
Technology, USA) were utilized to collect brain waves, galvanic skin response, and pupil dilation,
respectively. All data collection was performed and synchronized through iMotions Attention
Tool (iMotions, Inc., USA) on a Windows 7 operating system.
B-Alert X10 is a 9-channel EEG system, which records brain waves from mid-line and
lateral sites on the scalp including Fz, Cz, POz, F3, C3, P3, F4, C4, P4 (Figure 2). In addition
to raw waves measured from the above nine sites using a 256 Hz sampling rate, B-Alert X10

generates four metrics (engagement, workload, distraction, and drowsy) in epochs of one second
for representing cognitive states,
Participants’ skin resistances between 2 electrodes attached to the index and the middle
ﬁngers of the nondominant hand were monitored by the Shimmer 3 GSR+ Unit using a 52 Hz
sampling frequency. Skin resistance ﬂuctuates in response to external or internal stimuli [10].
The GSR was included in the body area network to detect the mental stress response.
The proposed experiment is a computer-based test, so a Tobii X60 eye tracker was mounted
on the screen to track how participants pupil dilation responded to stimuli on the screen monitor.
Figure 3 shows the experimental setup of the EEG headset, the GSR sensor, and the eye-tracking
system.
The ultimate goal of this work is to build a cost-eﬃcient, compact, and portable error early
warning system, and NeuroSky MindWave Mobile (NeuroSky, Inc., USA) will be a possible
solution. NeuroSky is a non-invasive EEG that connects the user to iOS and Android platforms,
and transfers all signal information through Bluetooth as opposed to radio. It can detect
brainwaves ranged from 0.1 Hz to 30 Hz, and divide them into delta, theta, low/ high alpha,
low/ high beta, and low/high gamma parts. An app was developed to acquire the data from
Neurosky . All data are sampled once per second. The attention and meditation level are
calculated based on the eight wave bands. Attention indicates the user level of focus and
meditation indicates the user level of relaxation.

Procedure

Participants were briefed with the experimental procedure and signed the consent form at the
beginning of the experiment. After setting up the EEG and GSR sensors, participants were
asked to follow instructions to perform a series of tasks for establishing the EEG baseline.
The personalized baseline was used to generate and normalize cognitive metrics: workload,
engagement, distraction, and drowsy measures. Then participants were asked to follow a dot
on the screen to calibrate the eye tracker. The preparation process took approximate 50 minutes.
The experimental procedure is shown in Figure 4. After ﬁnishing calibrations, participants
started to do the experiment with a 3-minute baselining session. During this time, they rested
and listened to Bach’s Harpsichord Concerto No. 5 in F Minor BWV 1056, which meets the

criterion for being of a relaxing nature [4]. The biosignals recorded from this session showed that
the participants were in a relaxed state. Following the baseline session, participants answered
20 congruent questions without a timer. Within these 20 questions, text and color were the
same and participants were able to answer questions at their own pace. Next, they answered
20 incongruent questions without a timer. Participants were then given a 2-minute rest session.
Next, they answered 20 congruent and 20 incongruent questions with a 3-second timer. This was
followed by another 2-minute rest session, and one more set of 20 congruent and 20 incongruent
questions, but with a 1.5-second timer. The Stroop eﬀect interferes with the reaction time
of a task, thus it was expected that participants would make more errors when answering
incongruent questions with time pressure. Lastly, participants answered a short survey about
their previous experience with the Stroop test and their perception of time pressure during the
test.

Preliminary Results

To determine an overview of each cognitive state, the average values of each metric over the
time spent on each session were calculated. Therefore, there were 10 data points of each metric
for each participant. Figure 5a and Figure 5b show the level of engagement and workload of
all participants through the test. Although there were diﬀerences between participants, they
tended to show lower engagement during rest sessions including the baseline session, and had
higher engagement when getting familiar with the test (i.e., the ﬁrst 20 congruent questions)
and under considerable time pressure (i.e., the last 20 incongruent questions with 1.5-second
timers). S003 had a relatively low engagement level in the ﬁrst test session. This participant
had prior experience with doing the Stroop test, which may have inﬂuenced this result. The
workload level did not change as much as engagement, but it was noticed that native English
speakers (S004, S005, S007) had higher average workload when doing tests. S007 showed a
somewhat diﬀerent trend from other participants in both engagement and workload. Based on
the survey result, she/he did not have enough sleep in the previous night (about 5 hours) and
did not feel stressed when the timer had started.
Figure 5c shows the GSR of all participants. The range of skin resistance is individual
dependent, so every participant has her/his own baseline. The unit of this ﬁgure is μS; a higher

conductance indicates a higher arousal. In the experiment, the arousal level was associated
with the stress level. Thus, the curves were ﬁtted for the diﬃculty level, and were similar to
the change in engagement.
To investigate how biosignals change with the outcome of each question, signals measured
from the EEG headset, the GSR sensor, the eye tracker, and the time spent on each question
were plotted and questions answered incorrectly were identiﬁed. For example, Figure 6 is the
plot of S005. She/he showed very low engagement/very high distraction in some questions in
the last session, where many errors occurred (9/20). Further experiments and analyses are
needed for identifying the causality. In addition, when she/he noticed an error was made, or
adjusted her/his state from rest to answer questions, the stress level increased. One of the most

common reasons for incorrect responses was that the participant ran out of time. Participants
tended to answer in a very short period for the question that followed an incorrectly answered
one. In the next section, the nine raw brain waves will be analyzed.

Approach to Raw Data Analysis

In addition to analyzing the GSR, eye movement and EEG metrics, two methods traditionally
applied to time series data of dynamic systems were applied to the EEG data sets. First
principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify diﬀerences across data sets acquired
under diﬀerent testing conditions (i.e. timer lengths). Independent component analysis (ICA) is
often used in EEG analysis instead of PCA because of its ability to detect and remove artifacts
in the data such as eye-blinks [8]. ICA has also been shown able to correlate brain activity to
behavioral phenomena including workload [14] and drowsiness [16]. PCA is chosen here in order
to investigate its ability to distinguish relatively long time histories acquired under diﬀerent test
conditions. Further, training data is not necessary to perform the PCA analysis presented here.
The second method is the least squares complex exponential (LSCE) parameter estimation
technique. The purpose of applying this technique to the EEG data is to investigate the ability
of the LSCE algorithm to identify a model for the data and then to use that model to make a
one-step-ahead prediction of the data. Both the PCA and the LSCE analysis are described in
the following sections.

5.1

Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) uses singular value decomposition to identify principal
values and vectors of a data set. The magnitude of the principal values indicate the contribution
1649

Dynamic Data Driven Approach for Modeling Human Error

of the corresponding vector in describing the data. In this work, PCA was applied to the set
of EEG time histories acquired from the bAlert system. Data from the nine data channels
(F3 ,FZ ,F4 ,C3 ,CZ ,C4 ,P4 ,P OZ ,P4 ) shown in Figure 2 were compiled into a single matrix, Q, as
follows:

where N is the number of data points in the selected data set. Singular value decomposition
was then applied to matrix Q to identify the left (vL ) and right (vR ) singular (principal) vectors
and the singular (principal) values (SV ):
[vL , SV, vR ] = svd(Q).

(2)

The singular values were used to identify which vectors contribute most to the overall
measured response. The corresponding vectors were then studied to identify the data channels
which were most aﬀected by the changing conditions of the test. This study focused on the
eﬀect of the presence of a timer while subjects answered questions, as described in Section 3.
Therefore, the data from a chosen subject was partitioned into three sets. The ﬁrst set contained
the data from the ﬁrst forty questions, in which no timer was present. The second set contained
the data from the second forty questions, in which a timer of 3 seconds was imposed on the
subject. Finally, the third set contained data from the last forty questions, in which a timer
of 1.5 seconds was imposed. The hypothesis explored with this analysis is that changes in
the singular values and vectors from the diﬀerent data sets correspond to changes in the brain
function caused by the change in test conditions.

5.2

Least Squares Complex Exponential Method

In dynamic systems analysis, the least squares complex exponential (LSCE) method [2] is used
to identify modal parameters from time histories acquired from multiple input-output pairs.
A parallel exists between dynamic data acquired using a single excitation source and multiple
sensors to measure a system’s response and the EEG data acquired here. In both cases, the
system is excited by a source. For traditional dynamic systems, the source is typically an
applied force to the system. In the experiment presented here, a subject’s brain is excited
by the presentation of a question. In traditional dynamics applications, the system’s response
will be aﬀected by its physical properties, boundary conditions, and environmental factors.
Similarly, the response of the subject’s brain will be aﬀected by his or her current mental state
(levels of fatigue, engagement, etc.), the diﬃculty of the task, and environmental conditions.
With these parallels in mind, the LSCE method was applied to the EEG data.
The purpose of the LSCE method is to identify the parameters, αk , such that
m

αk hn (ti+k ) = 0

(3)

k=0

where m is the model order, hn (t) is an impulse response function, n indicates the data channel
of interest, and i is an arbitrary starting index within the time vector, t. Note that the index
i must be selected such that i + m is within the bounds of the data. Because an impulse
response function could not be directly determined from the data acquired from the EEG sensors
(impulse response function calculations require the input force to be measured), an operational
1650

Dynamic Data Driven Approach for Modeling Human Error

Hu, et al.

impulse response function was used instead. As detailed in [3], the operational impulse response
function of a time history, x(t), is the positive lags of the autocorrelation function, Rxx . The
ˆ
operational impulse response function will be denoted as h(t),
with the ˆ distinguishing it from
the standard impulse response function. After substituting in the operational impulse response
function, normalizing the αk terms by αm , and rearranging, Equation 3 becomes
α0 hˆn (ti+0 ) + α1 hˆn (ti+1 ) + · · · + αm−1 hˆn (ti+m−1 ) = −hˆn (ti+m )

(4)

Equation 4 has m − 1 unknowns, and, therefore, more equations are necessary in order to
determine the values for the αk ’s. The additional equations come from the N diﬀerent data
channels as well as altering the starting index i within the same data stream:

Results
Principal Component Analysis

To explore the potential of using PCA to assess brain function, data from one subject (S005)
was analyzed in depth. Future work will expand this approach to include data from multiple
subjects.
Figure 7 shows the singular values for the data from the three test sections (i.e., no timer,
3 second timer, 1.5 second timer) acquired from the chosen subject. In general, the trends for
all three data sets is similar. For all three data sets, the ﬁrst singular value is signiﬁcantly
larger than the other eight indicating that the ﬁrst component contributes most strongly to
the overall response. The singular values of components two through ﬁve form a cluster of
components that contribute less than the ﬁrst, but are distinct from components six through
nine. The dropoﬀ in magnitude of the singular values after component ﬁve indicates that the
contributions of components six through nine are not as signiﬁcant as those of the ﬁrst ﬁve.
Therefore, only the ﬁrst ﬁve components will be used in subsequent analyses.
Figure 8 shows the amplitudes of the ﬁrst right singular vectors for the three data sets.
Singular vectors determined by singular value decomposition form an orthogonal set of vectors
and are analogous to operational mode shapes in traditional vibrations analysis. The singular

vectors indicate the relative amplitude of response of each of the electrodes for the selected
component. Changes in the amplitude, or ”shape”, of the vector indicates a change in the
measured response for that data set. In Figure 8, the three vectors have distinct shapes. A
possible explanation for these diﬀerences is that the addition of a timer aﬀected the subject’s
brain function due to perceived stress caused by the time pressure.
Figure 9 shows the right singular vectors for components two through ﬁve for the three data
sets. Component two (vR2 ) is fairly consistent across data sets, but the other three components
exhibit distinct diﬀerences. In general, the trends exhibited by the vectors associated with the
other three components (vR3 , vR4 , vR5 ) progress from the un-timed data set (blue), to the data
set with a 3 second time (green), to the data set with the 1.5 second timer. For example, the
plot of the vR4 vectors shows that the shape ﬂattens out near the C3 node as the time-toanswer is decreased. Conversely, the shape peaks more near the C4 node as the time-to-answer
decreases. Although these trends are for a single subject, they show the potential for this type
of analysis to distinguish mental states. Future work will be needed to establish statistically
signiﬁcant correlations between the trends observed here and the human state.

Least Squares Complex Exponential Analysis

A long term goal of this work is develop predictive capabilities that include determining when
a person is susceptible to poor decision making. Model development is a key component of
that eﬀort. To determine the eﬀectiveness of the model presented in Equation 3, Equation 5
was solved using data from the nine electrode channels and a model order of 16. Data was
ﬁrst partitioned by question, and a model was determined for the data from each question
individually. This partitioning allowed for comparisons to be made across testing conditions,
since the time-to-answer was decreased for the three sets of questions. To determine how well
the model describes the data, the distributions of the mean and standard deviation of the
percent error for each question were determined and are shown in Figure 10. These results
show that the model is most accurate when the time pressure is greatest. Figure 10A shows
that for 26 of the 40 questions presented with the shortest timer, the model error is less than
12%. Eighty-ﬁve percent of all of the data was modeled with less than 25% error. This model
represents one-step-ahead predictive capability. Ongoing work is being conducted to improve
both its accuracy and predictive capability.

Conclusions

In this paper, a dynamic data driven approach to predict operator error taking advantage of
the advances in commercial grade neuro-physiological sensors is described. Some elements of
the overall approach presented in this paper are: (1) a human system DDDAS is implemented
as a classical dynamic data driven application system. The human operator is wired with
commercial grade B-alert, Shimmer, and eye-tracking sensors. Data from these sensors are
assimilated in an android body area network and streamed into the stress-intensity simulation
model. The simulation model assesses the stress and intensity of stress in the operator and
generates one period prediction, (2) an experimental method to collect data on human subject,
and (3) analysis and prediction approach based on principal component analysis with singular
value decomposition. The preliminary result of this study is promising. It was shown that
under stressful conditions, the model can, with reasonable certainty, predict the occurrence of
an error one period in advance. This is signiﬁcant and with improvement of prediction and
sensor fusion algorithms, predictions of errors will be made earlier.
