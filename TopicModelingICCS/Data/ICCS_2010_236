Abstract
In the paper novel application of active contour without edges method to left ventricle segmentation in ultrasound
echocardiographic images is presented. In the proposed approach detection of informative image part and limitation of
segmentation area is done by means of Hough transform what guarantees stability and correctness of the segmentation algorithm
working on border between object and background with small absolute value of image gradient. Additionally, in order to increase
image quality, speckle noise anisotropic diffusion filtering was applied to input noisy data. Preliminary quantitative results for
artificial USG-like images and visual ones for real echocardiographic data are presented in the paper.

1. Introduction

1.1. Ejection Fraction
Cardiovascular system diseases are responsible for over 7 million premature demises in the world per year. One
of the main factor of cardiovascular risk is hypertension leading, among others, to left ventricle (LV) rebuilding.
Therefore measurement of left ventricle shape in ultrasound echocardiographic images (ECG) is recognized as one
of the main medical examination. It allows to estimate of the heart state and cardiovascular risk [1]. Main
advantages of this kind of examination is low cost of measurement and noninvasiveness.
Ejection fraction (EF) is one of parameters that are the most frequently used for estimation of the heart state. It is
the fraction of blood pumped out of a ventricle during each heart beat:

EF = (EDV − ESV ) / EDV

Fig. 1. Block scheme of proposed method

where EDV denotes end-diastolic volume and ESV is end-systolic volume. Usually, EF is calculated for left
ventricle (LV) and has a name LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Algorithms for LVEF calculation based on Teichholz
or Quinones methods, which are widely used in clinical practice, can be found in [2, 3]. However results which are
obtained with their help have a quite big error very often. As an alternative some researchers have proposed using
segmentation techniques for estimation of chamber volume.
1.2. LV segmentation
Problem of efficient LV segmentation and tracking in echocardiographic images is widely reported in literature,
see for example [4-11]. Malassoitis and Strintzis [5] applied Hough transform for ellipse model to obtain the initial
approximation of the searched object in the first frame of the sequence. Then active contour model, based on
gradient image , is used for estimation of the LV boundary. Finally, estimated results are corrected by observing the
shape deformations. Jacobs et al. [7] proposed dynamic contour tracker which uses Kalman filter. In this solution,
user intervention is required: a few contours have to be drown on the data prior to running the tracker in order to
learn the nominal deformation parameters and placement initial contour. In [8], authors used active contours with
gradient constrains also. Before segmentation process, DWT filtration is applied. Result obtained for current frame
is used as initial contour in the next image. For first image, initial contour is calculated in multiresolution scheme in
connection with classical K-means clustering. Cheng et al. [11] proposed method which uses a watershed transform
and morphological operation to locate the region containing the LV, then performs active contour deformation with
a multiscale directional edge map.
In this paper application of the level set segmentation method [12, 13] based on Active Contour without edges
algorithm [14] to the LV segmentation with filtration and ROI definition is presented.
1.3. Main idea
Main idea of our approach is presented in Fig. 1. First, we compute borders (limits) of Region of Interest (ROI) being a triangle-like pure USG part of the acquired ECG image – using linear Hough transform and simple
mathematics. Then, the speckle reduction anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) filter [15] is used. Finally, image
segmentation with initialization procedure via the Active Contour without edges [14] with initialization is presented.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the Region of Interest calculation and description of SRAD
adaptive filtering procedure. Section 3 describes applied segmentation algorithm. In section 4 segmentation
preliminary quantitative segmentation results calculated for artificial ECG model and visual results for real data are
presented. Section 5 contains conclusions and future work.

2. Preprocessing
2.1. Borders calculation
Due to the ECG image structure, in the beginning it is necessary to calculate borders of its USG part in order to
limit image area of interest and prevent LV miss-segmentation in next steps. This requirement results from the fact
that the searched object (LV) and background area have very similar intensity values and it is very difficult to
distinguish one side of the LV border what can lead to significant segmentation error.
We propose calculation of two lines and one arc that limit USG part of the image area. The lines are calculated
after simple image thresholding operation: pixels which have intensity values higher than a threshold are set to 1, the
other are set to 0. Experimentally we found the best threshold value equals 30. After thresholding, boundary
between pixels equal one and pixels marked as zero should be determined. It is done by calculation of the linear
Hough transform [16] of the pre-processed thresholded image using the following parametric representation of a
line:

ς = x ⋅ cos(φ ) + y ⋅ sin (φ )
In the Hough transform coefficients space two peaks with opposite sign and maximum values are automatically
found. Since angels of the searched lines are approximately known we can limit the searching range from +/- 20 to
70 degrees. Having the peaks detected, one can easily calculate equations of two lines.
Next, coordinates of lines intersection are taken as the arc centre. In order to find the radius length the
thresholded image is used again. Maximum distance from the arc centre to pixels having value 1 is chosen as the
radius. Exemplary results of using the proposed automatic procedure for borders calculation is shown in Fig. 2.
2.2. SRAD adaptive filtering procedure
Multiplicative noise is the dominating noise in USG images. It is known as speckle noise and its influence to the
luminance of USG pixels is described by the following mathematical model:

g=u f

(1)

2726

A. Skalski et al. / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 2723–2732
A. Skalski, P. Turcza, T. ZieliĔski, J. Królczyk, T. Grodzicki/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000–000

where u and f represent noise and signal samples which can be modeled as random statistically-independent
variables, i.e.

E[u f ] = E[u ]E[ f ]

(2)

It is widely accepted that for the noise stationary model can be assumed (mean value and variance, respectively
[17]):

E[u ] = u , E[(u − u ) 2 ] = ı u2

(3)

In [18] it was shown that (1) can be rewritten into the form: signal + noise which in turn allows application of
adaptive filtration of USG signal g to remove the multiplicative noise u and revover f

g = f + (u − 1) f ,

n = (u − 1) f

(4)

where n represents additive noise depending on signal f. Next, the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
estimator [18] is applied as follows

fˆ = a1g + a0 ,

(5)

Values of coefficients {a0, a1} should minimize the cost function:

Bmse ( fˆ ) = E[( f − fˆ ) 2 ] ,
what leads to the filtering equation

ıfu
fˆ = f + 2 (g − g ) .
ıg
2

(6)

For practical application of the above filter, estimation of ratio between variances of the original (ıf2) and observed
noisy signal (ıg2) is necessary. Making use of variance definition and statistical independence of signal and noise (2)
one has

ı 2f
ı g2

=

1 − Cu2 / C g2
(Cu2 + 1)u 2

,

Cu2 = ı u2 / u 2 , C g2 = ı g2 / g 2

Setting the calculated quotient to (6) one gets

1 − Cu / C g
(g − g ) .
fˆ = g +
1+ Cu2

2727

A. Skalski, P. Turcza, T. ZieliĔski, J. Królczyk, T. Grodzicki / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000–000

Due to noise stationary assumption (3), value Cu2 is constant and can be estimated using smooth (i.e. without edges)
fragment of the USG image. In turn, value Cg2 represents normalized local variance of the signal and is estimated
using small neighborhood of the currently processed pixel (usually 4 neighboring pixels). When the current pixel
has neighborhood without edges, the ratio Cu2/ Cg2 is close to 1 and the pixel is replaced by the local mean value
what causes noise reduction. In case of edge occurrence, averaging operation has a smaller weight what prevents
smoothing and shifting edges existing in the original image.
Operation (7) can be performed iteratively (many times) on the image. In such case equation (7) should be rewritten into the form

I t + ǻt = I t + (1 − k )( I t − I t ) ,

1− k =

1+ 1 / C g2
1+ 1 / Cu2

(8)

where I t + ǻt is estimated value, i.e. corresponds to fˆ in (7), and I t play a role of g in (7). While examining the
filter proposed by Lee [16], authors in [15] observed that the approximation of expected value of I i, j in (8) by
means of 4 neighboring image pixels leads to the following equation

I it,+j Δt = I it, j + (1 − ki, j )[(I it+1, j + I it−1, j + I it, j +1 + I it, j −1 ) / 4 − I it, j ]

(10)

in which appears the factor

(ΔI )ti , j = [( I it+1, j + I it−1, j + I it, j +1 + I it, j −1 ) − 4 I it, j ] ,
being a discrete approximation of the Laplacian. This suggests possibility of presenting equation (8) in a form of
nonlinear diffusion, well-known among image processing professionals from equation of the Perona-Malik filter
[20]. Indeed, shifting coefficient (1-k) under the divergence sign we have [21]

I t + ǻt = I t +

ǻt
div[(1 − k t ) ⋅ ∇I t ]
4

(11)

The above equation has now a form identical to original Perona-Malik filter [20]

∂I
= div[c(|∇I |) ⋅ ∇I ] ,
∂t

I (t = 0) = I 0 ,

(12)

where ∇ denotes an image gradient, I0 is an initial image to be denoised and c(x) is a diffusion coefficient.
The Perona-Mallik filter is very popular because it allows image denoising while simultaneously sharpening
edges and precisely preserving their positions. This nice feature results from the fact that the solution of (12), in
moment t and for initial condition I0, is equal

I ( x, y,t ) = I 0 ( x, y ) ∗ g (x, y,t ) ,
where g(x, y, t) is a 2-D Gaussian function with variance 2t and ”*” denotes convolution. Argument of the
coefficient c(x) in (12) is magnitude of image gradient which is the edge estimator. Where c(| ∇I |) ≈ 0 equation

2728

A. Skalski, P. Turcza, T. ZieliĔski, J. Królczyk, T. Grodzicki/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 000–000

(12) represents all-pass filter that preserves edges. In turn, c(| ∇I |) ≈ 1 gives isotropic smoothing by means of 2-D
Gaussian window. Therefore, exchanging c(| ∇I |) in (12) for (1-k) in (11) leads to filter allowing reduction of
multiplicative noise and the same time preserving and sharpening edges.
3. Segmentation of ECG
3.1. Active Contours and Level Sets
In our work we used the version of Active Contours (Snakes) algorithm proposed by Chan and Vese [14]. The
basic idea of classical snake techniques is to evolve a curve in 2D space, subject to constrains from a given image I.
Active Contours method was proposed by Kass et al. [22]. The snake model should minimize:
1

F1 (C ) = α C ' ( S ) ds + β C ' ' ( s ) ds − λ ∇I (C ( s )) ds

(13)

0

where C(s): [0, 1] ĺ R2 is a parameterized curve and Į, ȕ, Ȝ are positive parameters. The first two terms in equation
(13) are known also as internal energy and they are responsible for smoothness of the contour. The last one, external
(image) energy, attracts the contour toward the object and due to it the snake will try to fit edges existing in the
image. In order to remove noise from the image and increase range of the snake, the image is usually convolved
with a Gaussian kernel before computing gradients. Using formulation (13) snake has a problem with topology
changing.
In alternative level set approach [12, 13], where contour is represented in implicit form Ԅ (14), topology is
changed automatically [12]:

C = {( x, y )φ ( x, y ) = 0}

(14)

In this case the curve evolution is given by the zero level set of the function Ԅ(x,y,t) at time t. Evolving the curve C
in normal direction with speed V is the solution of elementary level set equation (15) [12]:

∂φ
+ V ⋅ ∇φ = 0
∂t

(15)

3.2. Segmentation based on area information
In Fig. 2b one can observe that walls of the chambers are not well visible (as a consequence image gradient will
be very small) what suggests that application of the classical active contour algorithm can lead to misssegmentation. Therefore we propose to use for ECG USG image segmentation an algorithm described in [14]. Its
main advantage is using information about intensity values inside and outside the contour. Energy functional (16)
consist of regularizing terms like length of the curve C and/or area of the region inside C with fitting terms F1(C)
and F2(C).

F (c1 , c2 , C ) = μ ⋅ Length(C ) + ν ⋅ Area(inside(C )) + λ 1 ⋅

where Ȝ1>0, Ȝ2>0, ȝ0, Ȟ0 are fixed parameters [14]. What is more, Chan and Vase replaced unknown variable C
by the unknown variable Ԅ what in consequences leads to level set formulation [14] (17)

­C = Γ = {(x, y ) ∈ Ω : φ ( x, y ) = 0}

®inside(C ) = ϖ = {( x, y ) ∈ Ω : φ ( x, y ) > 0}
°outside(C ) = Ω \ ϖ = {( x, y ) ∈ Ω : φ ( x, y ) < 0}

(17)

More details about level sets can be found in [12]. With level set formulation equation (16) can be rewritten as (18):

F (c1 , c 2 , φ ) = μ ⋅ ³ δ (φ ( x, y ) ∇φ (x, y ) )dxdy +ν ⋅ ³ H (φ (x, y ))dxdy

Where, H(.) is a Heaviside function. Finally after minimization process, described in [14], the equation in Ԅ(x,y,t)
with artificial time t0 has the following form (į - delta function):

3.3. Initialization
One of the most important problems in Active Contour application is good choice of an initialization procedure
since snake algorithms require definition of an initial contour from which evolution is started. In our approach we
propose starting evolution from an ellipse which is similar to the LV shape. Its centre can be indicated by a user. If
one segments a sequence of images, segmentation results from the previous frame can be treated as initial contour in
the analysis of next frame .
4. Experimental results
The algorithm has been tested first on synthetic (artificial) ECG-like data (Fig. 3) and then on real ones (Fig. 5).
The synthetic ECG-like matrices were generated by means of B-mode ultrasound echographic image acquisition
model, proposed in [24], that has been implemented in Matlab for the purpose of the presented research. The model
consists of:
• simulation of the sectoral scan of a plane by an ultrasonic beam (points are scattered in polar coordinate system),
• speckle noise addition in polar coordinates system by simulating a random walk in the plane of the image
complex amplitude, according to the Burckhardt speckle formation taking into account origin of ultrasound
echoes generation,
• coming from Cartesian to polar scattering and vice versa by interpolation.
The synthetic USG-like images were generated with the following values of model parameters: image having
256x256 pixels with luminance normalized in the range [0, 1], m=128 arcs with n=64 points each, M(x, y) - number
of random walk steps - taken from the interval [1, 20], variance of a phaser magnitude ı2 = [from 0.1 to 2.5]/256,
the scanning angle Ĭ=ʌ/3, origin height (offset) y0=16 pixels. The real data were obtained from Department of
General Medicine and Geriatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland. In this case for
experiments 5 representative real ECG records have been chosen.
Parameters of the Active Contour segmentation were set in each experiment as follows: Ȝ1=Ȝ2=1 and Ȟ=0. In order
to estimate the segmentation quality the following segmentation efficiency measure has been used [23]:

5. Conclusion and future work
In the paper segmentation of left ventricle in echocardiographic USG images was discussed. The proposed,
implemented and tested novel procedure consists of three basic modules: ROI calculation by means of Hough
transform, image denoising by means of SRAD filtration and, finally, image segmentation by means of active
contour without edges method. Exemplary segmentation results were presented for artificial ECG-like and real ECG
images. Visual and numerical results confirm usefulness of the proposed method for segmentation of ECG images.
Results of echocardiographic segmentation, performed by the presented method, can be further exploited for
calculation of typical medical parameters used in heart diagnosing. The proposed scheme can be modified and in
conjugation with deformable image registration methods, e.g. B-Spline Free Form Deformation or Spring Mass
system, can be used for calculation of deformations of hearts structures like heart walls. In near future complete
method validation based on artificial model and manual segmentation of real ECG images made by doctors is
planned.
