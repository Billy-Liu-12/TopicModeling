Abstract. The relationship between the peak stage and peak discharge is
influenced by many factors in the flood system. Therefore, different peak
discharges may occur under the same peak stage, while the same peak discharge
may also occur under the different peak stages. If the peak stage set with similar
peak discharges is taken as the fuzzy subset in the stage universe, then the
membership function of these fuzzy subsets can be hypothesized to manifest a
normal distribution graph. According to a k and bk , the mid-value of the
universe element of the peak stage can be substituted into the normal
distribution graph, and the fuzzy relational matrix can be obtained. Thus, the
peak discharge can be calculated according to the peak stage using the fuzzy
deduction theory. The relationship between the peak stage and peak discharge
as Q = f (H ) has an important impact on the determination of the peak
discharge during the high-water level period in the flood forecast. In this paper,
the fuzzy information analysis method is used to forecast the peak discharge,
with the result in accordance with the actual event. This method can be seen as
a new and effective method of flood prediction and forecasting.
Keywords: fuzzy information analysis; universe; fuzzy relational matrix; flood
forecast.

1 Introduction
Flooding is a common occurrence in China, and one that causes serious damage and
harm. It is estimated that of the total economical loss caused by all kinds of disasters,
40% was due to flooding. Floods occur frequently, affect large areas of the
community, and hence constitute a huge threat to human life and property. Flood
damage has been aggravated by the rapid progress of the economy in recent years [1].
However, flood systems are complicated systems with strong indeterminacy [2-3].
Therefore, a method of recognition of flood systems using the fuzzy information
analysis method [4] is devised and discussed in this paper.

2 Method of Fuzzy Information Analysis
Selection of a system model with higher reliability is difficult. A simple method is to
directly construct a fuzzy relational matrix R without any transition through language
variables and message net blocks [5-6].

Peak stage H and peak discharge Q are the most important parameters for the
formation of flood damage. Unfortunately, at present the exact relationship between
the two parameters as
Q = f (H )

(1)

cannot be found. In fact, there exists a fuzzy relationship between the two parameters.
Therefore, the universe ranges of the peak stage and peak discharge need to be
determined first. For the purpose of flood prevention, the range of the peak stage can
be selected as m classes, and therefore the universe of the peak stage should be
U H = {H 1 , H 2 , " , H m } . The range of the peak discharge can also be selected as n
classes and the corresponding universe of the peak discharge should be
U Q = {Q1 , Q2 , " , Qn } .
The method of determining the fuzzy relation through hypothesizing of the
distribution form can only be performed upon analysis of the physical process. The
relationship between the peak stage and peak discharge has been influenced by many
factors in the flood system. If the peak stage set with similar peak discharges is taken
as the fuzzy subset in the stage universe, then the membership function μ k (H ) of
these fuzzy subsets can be hypothesized to manifest a normal distribution graph as
follows:

⎡ ⎛H −a

μ k ( H ) = exp ⎢− ⎜⎜
⎢ ⎝ bk

⎞

⎟
⎠

⎥
⎥
⎦

(2)

In the equation, k means the class of the peak discharge, with a k and bk as constants
that can be obtained from the historical flood samples. Suppose the number of flood
samples with the class of the peak discharge of k is N, then a k and bk can be
calculated according to the following two equations:

means the value of the peak stage of the jth sample.

According to a k and bk , the mid-value of the universe element H i of the peak
stage can be substituted into the equation (2), and the fuzzy relational matrix R can be
obtained. If the mid-value of H i is H i , then the element of R should be

rik = μ k ( H i ) .
After determination of the fuzzy relational matrix R, the peak discharge Q can be
calculated according to the peak stage H using the fuzzy deduction theory as follows:

The operator “ D ” means the combination operation in the equation.
As to the first forecast model, the relative fuzzy expression can be represented as
H = 1 H i using the concept concerning language variables in fuzzy mathematics.
Thus, the following expression can be constructed:
⎡ r11

The above equation represents a fuzzy subset on the universe of the peak discharge. It
is the result of the fuzzy recognition.

3 Application Illustration
The relationship between the peak stage and peak discharge as Q = f (H ) has an
important impact on the determination of the peak discharge during the high-water
level period in the flood forecast. Unfortunately, this relationship remains
undetermined owing to the complexity of the factors that influence the flood.
Therefore, different peak discharges may occur under the same peak stage, while the
same peak discharge may also occur under the different peak stages. Table 1 lists data
of the annual maximum peak stage H and annual maximum peak discharge Q
surveyed in the Hankou hydrometric station of the Changjiang River of China. From
the table it can be seen that the peak stage values H are about the same in 1948 and
1949 at the Hankou hydrometric station. Conversely, the two corresponding peak
discharge values Q are different. In addition, the peak discharge values Q are about
the same in 1935 and 1952, whilst the two corresponding peak stage values H are
very different. Furthermore, a situation where the peak discharge value Q became
even larger at a small peak stage value H was also observed.

In fact, a definite relationship can only exist within a certain range between the
annual maximum peak stage H and annual maximum peak discharge Q, owing to the
action of the factors that influence flooding. Therefore, flood data was selected for the

present discussion in a range from 1865 to 1970 at the Hankou hydrometric station of
the Changjiang River. This area was scarcely influenced by human activity and so is
less likely to be affected by extra factors, although the station was short of flood data
for the period 1944-1945. The annual maximum peak stage H in the range was
divided into nine classes. From this the universe of H should be
U H = {H 1 , H 2 , " , H 9 } as shown in Table 3. The annual maximum peak discharge Q
in the range was also divided into ten classes. From these classes, the universe of Q
should be U Q = {Q1 , Q2 , " , Q10 } as shown in Table 2. According to the calculation

from equations (3) and (4), the values of a k and bk can be obtained (as listed in
Table 2). As a result of the scarcity of the sample number of Q8 , Q9 Q10 , several

values of b12 b72 . Afterwards, the mid-value H i of the universe of the annual
maximum peak stage was substituted into the equation (2). From this the fuzzy
relational matrix R between H and Q can be obtained, as shown in Table 3.
With the help of the fuzzy relational matrix R, the annual maximum peak discharge
Q can be obtained according to equation (5). The fit rate of the calculated result for
the flood data from 1865 to 1970 in the Hankou hydrometric station is satisfactory at
a rate of 73%.
Thus, the annual maximum peak discharge in the Hankou hydrometric station can
be predicted according to the present fuzzy relational matrix R. For example, the
annual maximum peak stage in 1971 in the Hankou hydrometric station is 24.21m. At
this time the value of H can satisfy the relation as H = 1 24.21 = 1 H 4 . Therefore,
fuzzy deduction can be performed according to equation (5) and the result can be
represented as follows:

If taking the value of Q with the highest probability as the forecasted value, then
the annual maximum peak discharge in 1971 can be forecasted in a range between
39000m3/s and 44000m3/s. In fact, the actual value of the annual maximum peak
discharge in 1971 is Q=43700m3/s, an exact forecasted value. The annual maximum
peak discharges from 1971 to 1976 in the Hankou hydrometric station were also
forecasted, as listed in Table 4. The forecasted values within those five years are in
accordance with the actual situations with the exception of 1972.

4 Conclusion
The relationship between the peak stage and peak discharge is hard to determine due
to the complexity of the factors which can influence flooding. In fact, there exists a
fuzzy relationship between the two terms. Therefore, the fuzzy information analysis
method can be used to study the exact relationship between the above two terms. The

method can also be used to forecast the corresponding peak stage or peak discharge
and precipitation runoff between the hydrometric stations in the upper and lower
reaches of the same river. Although the result of the flood forecast is always within a
certain range, the forecast can satisfy the demands of most situations. In conclusion,
flood forecasting using the fuzzy information analysis technology is effective.
