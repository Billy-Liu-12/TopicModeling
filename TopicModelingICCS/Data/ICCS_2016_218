Abstract
In this paper, a novel technique for cost-efficient design optimization of microwave structures has
been proposed. Our approach exploits an adaptive response scaling that ensures good alignment
between an equivalent circuit (used as an underlying low-fidelity model) and an electromagnetic (EM)
simulation model of the structure under design. As the adaptive scaling tracks the low-fidelity model
changes both in terms of frequency and the response level, it exhibits better generalization capability
than traditional (e.g., space mapping) surrogates. This translates into improved design reliability and
reduced design cost. Our methodology is demonstrated using two examples of microstrip filters and
compared to several variations of conventional space mapping.

1 Introduction
Electromagnetic (EM)-simulation-driven design closure is an important step of the microwave
design process. It typically aims at adjustment of geometry parameters of the structure at hand (e.g., a
filter) to ensure that given design specifications (concerning, e.g., return loss) are met (Koziel and
Bekasiewicz, 2015). Deviations from the ideal/required characteristics are normally due to
inaccuracies of the simplified representations—such as equivalent circuit models—utilized to obtain
the initial (or pre-tuning) design.
For the sake of automation, it is advantageous that the EM-based design closure is conducted
through numerical optimization. This, however, may be computationally expensive when conventional
off-the-shelf algorithms are utilized. Numerous techniques have been proposed to speed up EM-driven

design, most of which rely on surrogate-based optimization (SBO) paradigm (Koziel, Yang and
Zhang, 2013). These include many variations of space mapping (SM), e.g., (Bandler et al. 2004;
Koziel, Bekasiewicz and Kurgan, 2014; Sans et al. 2014) response correction techniques (Echeverria
and Hemker, 2005; Koziel 2010; Koziel and Leifsson, 2013) utilization of artificial neural networks
(Gorissen et al. 2011), as well as simulation-based tuning and tuning space mapping (Cheng, Bandler
and Koziel, 2012). Furthermore, availability of cheap adjoint sensitivities (Basl, Bakr and Nikolova,
2008; Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2015) revived, to some extent, the interest in gradient-based
optimization (Toivanen et al. 2010), also in connection with SBO (Koziel et al. 2013; Koziel and
Leifsson, 2013). On the other hand, the utilization of adjoints is not yet widespread in the microwave
engineering community.
Majority of SBO techniques require a rather careful implementation as well as certain engineering
insight into the problem. One of the issues pertinent to, for example, SM, is the necessity of
appropriate selection of the type and parameters of the surrogate model (such as preassigned
parameters for implicit space mapping (Bandler et al. 2004; Bekasiewicz, Kurgan and Kitlinski,
2012)). Straightforward application of such methods may lead to unpromising results, including
convergence issues (Koziel, Bandler and Madsen, 2009). Methods such as simulation-based tuning are
much more robust yet limited in terms of application scope and software requirements. Other
techniques, such as the shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP) (Koziel, 2010), require the
fulfillment of specific assumptions concerning the response shape of the structure of interest and as
well as relatively complex implementation.
In this paper, we propose a simple adaptive scaling technique for fast design optimization of
microwave devices. It is based on tracking the changes (both frequency- and level-wise) of the
underlying low-fidelity model (e.g., an equivalent circuit) to ensure good generalization capability of
the surrogate model constructed with it. Our approach is demonstrated using two examples of
microstrip bandpass filters and compared to several variations of space mapping algorithms.

2 Surrogate-Based Optimization Basics
Let Rf(x) be a response of the EM-simulated (high-fidelity) model of a device (e.g., filter) under
design, where x is a vector of adjustable (geometry) parameters, and Rf represents relevant responses
such as S-parameters versus frequency. Let Rc(x) denote the low-fidelity model of the same device,
e.g., an equivalent circuit. The problem to be solved is
x * = arg min U ( R f ( x ))

(1)

x

where U encodes given design specifications, and x* is the optimum design to be founds.
According to the SBO paradigm (Koziel, Yang and Zhang, 2013), direct solving of (1) is replaced
by an iterative procedure
x (i +1) = arg min U ( Rs(i ) ( x ))

(2)

x

where x(i), i = 0, 1, …, is a sequence of approximations to x*, and Rs(i) is a surrogate model at iteration
i, which is a fast representation of the high-fidelity constructed using Rc.
The most important differences between various realizations of SBO algorithms are in the
methodologies for constructing the surrogate model. The most popular SBO approach in microwave
engineering is space mapping, where the surrogate is obtained by usually simple correction of the lowfidelity model of the form Rs(x) = Rc(x;p), where p are the SM parameters extracted or calculated to

reduce the misalignment between the surrogate and the low-fidelity model at the most recent design or
at several previous designs encountered at the optimization patch. Examples include input SM with
Rs(x) = Rc(Bx + c), implicit SM (Rs(x) = Rc(x;p) where p are so-called preassigned parameters, e.g.,
the substrate height and permittivity (Bandler et al. 2004)), or output SM (Rs(x) = Rc(x) + Δ, where Δ
is typically a constant vector, e.g., Δ = Rf(x(i)) – Rc(x(i))).
Satisfaction of at least zero-order consistency between the surrogate and the high-fidelity model
(i.e., Rf(x(i)) = Rs(i)(x(i))) is critical for the algorithm convergence (Alexandrov and Lewis, 2001;
Koziel, Bandler and Madsen, 2009). Ensuring it by output SM as in the previous paragraph, may not
work well for highly nonlinear (e.g., filter) responses (Koziel, Bandler and Madsen, 2008).

3 Surrogate Construction By Adaptive Response Scaling
Here, we introduce an adaptive response scaling (ARS) technique that aims at constructing the
surrogate model that (i) preserves zero-order consistency Rs(i)(x(i)) = Rf(x(i)), and (ii) exhibits good
generalization capability by accounting for both frequency and amplitude changes of the low-fidelity
model responses during the optimization process.
Figure 1 shows the high- and low-fidelity model responses (here, |S11|) at the reference design x(i)
and another design x. It can be observed that the models are significantly misaligned yet relatively
well correlated. The adaptive response scaling attempts to explore these correlations using the
procedure described below.
The response scaling is realized at the level of complex S-parameter responses, separately for the
respective real and imaginary parts. In the first step, frequency relationship is between the low- and
high-fidelity model at the reference design x(i) (i.e., the design being the starting point for the
subsequent iteration of (2)) is retrieved by solving
F (i ) (ω ) = arg min ³

ωmax

ωmin

F

rf ( x (i ) , ω ) − rc ( x ( i ) , F (ω )) dω ,

(3)

where F is a nonlinear frequency scaling function, here, implemented using cubic splines with 20
control points within the frequency range of interest; rf/rc are high-/low-fidelity responses of interest
(e.g., Re(S11), etc.). F(i) minimizes the discrepancy between the responses within the frequency range
of interest ωmin to ωmax.
A scaling function similar to (3) is computed to account for the (frequency) changes of the lowfidelity model response between x(i) and x. In particular, we have
F ( x, ω ) = arg min ³
F

ωmax

ωmin

rc ( x, ω ) − rc ( x (i ) , F (ω )) dω .

(4)

Additionally, the amplitude changes of the low-fidelity model are calculated as
A( x, ω ) = [ rc ( x , ω ) + 1] ÷ ª¬ rc ( x (i ) , F ( x , ω )) + 1º¼ .

(5)

Here, ÷ denotes component-wise division with respect to frequency. The shift by +1 is introduced
in order to avoid division by zero (for frequencies for which rc(x(i),F(x,ω)) = 0) and to avoid too large
values of |A| (for rc close to zero).
The prediction phase of the surrogate model is realized as follows. First, the reference high-fidelity
model response rf(x(i),ω) is scaled in frequency using F(x,ω) in order to account for the changes of the
low-fidelity model while moving from x(i) to x (the low- and high-fidelity models are assumed to be
1044

Cost-Eﬃcient Microwave Design Optimization Using Adaptive Response Scaling

S. Koziel, et al

well correlated although perhaps misaligned in the absolute terms). Then, the amplitude scaling
function A(x,ω) is scaled in frequency using F(i)(x,ω) in order to accommodate the frequency
relationships between the low- and high-fidelity model at the reference design; finally, it is applied to
correct the surrogate response in amplitude. Formally, the surrogate model is defined as
rs ( x , ω ) = A( x , F (i ) (ω )) D ª¬ rf ( x (i ) , F ( x , ω )) + 1º¼ − 1

(6)

where ° denotes component-wise multiplication.
Note that the scaling function F(i) is only calculated once per iteration (2), whereas (4) and (5) are
computed for each evaluation of the surrogate model.
For the sake of example, Fig. 2 shows Re(S11) of the responses shown in Fig. 1, as well as the
response of the surrogate model constructed according to ARS. It can be observed that that the
prediction power of the model is very good, especially given considerable misalignment between the
low- and high-fidelity models as well as considerable change of the responses between the designs x(0)
and x. Figure 3 shows how this translates to |S11| prediction. At the same time, the quality of the
conventional output SM prediction is poor as it does not account for model response changes in
frequency.

4 Verification Examples
In this section, we present numerical verification of the proposed design optimization approach. It
is demonstrated using two examples of microstrip filters, a sixth- and an eight-order ones. Comparison
with benchmark optimization algorithms (all surrogate-based) is also provided.

4.1 Sixth-Order Microstrip Bandpass Filter

(İr = 3.5, tanį = 0.0018, h = 0.762 mm). The design variables are x = [w1 w2 w3 d1 d2 d3 l1 l2 l3]T.

The EM model is implemented in CST Microwave studio and simulated using its frequency
domain solver (CST, 2013). The model consists of about 125,000 hexahedral mesh cells and its
average simulation time is 3 min. The low-fidelity model is an equivalent circuit implemented in
Agilent ADS (Agilent, 2011). The design specifications are |S11| ≤ –20 dB for 4 GHz ≤ ω ≤ 7 GHz,
and |S11| ≥ –3 dB for ω ≤ 3.85 GHz and ω ≥ 7.15 GHz. The filter was optimized using ARS (cf. Fig.
5), as well as—for the sake of comparison—several variations of space mapping algorithm (cf. Table
1). It can be observed that ARS ensured better reliability and lower design cost compared to
1046

Cost-Eﬃcient Microwave Design Optimization Using Adaptive Response Scaling

conventional SM. It is also important to note that some of the space mapping algorithms did not
converge. It is well known that performance and computational cost of space mapping optimization
depends on the choice of the underlying SM transformations (Koziel, Bandler and Madsen, 2008) and
this choice is not trivial (Koziel and Bandler, 2007). This means, in particular, that the outcome of
space mapping optimization is uncertain until the optimization run has actually been executed. ARS is
free from these problems because of being parameter-less.

4.2 Eight-Order Microstrip Bandpass Filter
Our second example is the 8th-order bandpass filter shown in Fig. 6. The design variables are x = [w1
w2 w3 w4 d1 d2 d3 d4 l1 l2 l3 l4]T. The EM model is implemented in CST Microwave Studio (~160,000
mesh cells, simulation time 6 min). The low-fidelity model is implemented in Agilent ADS. The design
specifications are |S11| ≤ –20 dB for 4 GHz ≤ ω ≤ 7 GHz, and |S11| ≥ –3 dB for ω ≤ 3.92 GHz and ω ≥
7.08 GHz. The filter optimized using ARS is shown in Fig. 7. Results of comparison with various SM
algorithms are gathered in Table 1. The overall performance of the benchmark techniques is consistent
with what was observed for the first example. Some of the SM variations did not work properly (the
optimization algorithm diverged) but also, the overall optimization cost is much higher than for ARS.

5 Conclusion
The adaptive response scaling (ARS) technique has been introduced for fast and reliable design
optimization of microwave structures. It has been demonstrated using two microstrip bandpass filters
of 6th and 8th orders. Numerical experiments indicate that ARS favorably compares with conventional
space mapping techniques. The most important feature of ARS is that it fully exploits the knowledge
about the problem embedded in the low-fidelity model. As opposed to space mapping approaches,
where the model alignment is realized using the response of the low-fidelity model at a specific point
(or points), ARS directly utilizes the changes of the low-fidelity model response under the change of
the location in the design space. Owing to this, absolute discrepancies between the low- and highfidelity models are not critical. For the same reason, generalization capability of the ARS surrogate is
better than for other methods. The proposed methodology can be considered as an alternative approach
to handle EM-driven design problems, particularly for structures with highly nonlinear responses such
as filters.
