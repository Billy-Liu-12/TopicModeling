Abstract. Due to rapid construction and limited urban area in Shanghai, some
deep excavations are very close to the existing metro tunnels or sensitive
superstructures. Therefore the safety of the adjacent tunnels and surrounding
structures become an important issue during design and construction of these
deep excavations. This paper presents a 3D finite-element modeling using the
finite element analysis program ABAQUS for an oversize deep excavation in
Shanghai soft deposits. The excavation is the excavation of the north square
underground shopping center of Shanghai South Railway Station. Two cases of
numerical analyses assuming anisotropic and isotropic soil stiffness
respectively are conducted. The estimated wall deflection and ground
movements are compared with the field monitoring results. It is found that soil
stiffness anisotropy has a significant effect on the accuracy of prediction of the
diaphragm wall deflection and the ground movement around excavation for the
oversize excavation in Shanghai soft deposits. The calculated ground
movements of the anisotropic case agree well with the field measurements.
Keywords: numerical modeling, excavation, ground movement, anisotropic
stiffness.

1 Introduction
To meet the increasing demand for economic growth, extensive underground structures
and metro systems have been rapidly constructed in Shanghai. Some of these
excavations are very close to the existing metro tunnels or sensitive superstructures.
The safety of the adjacent tunnels and surrounding structures may be affected by the
ground movement induced by the excavation. The excavation of the north square
underground shopping center of Shanghai South Railway Station is one of the deep
excavations under complicated conditions in the urban area of Shanghai. The site is
located in the south of the city. It was only about 3 m away from the existing tunnels of
Shanghai Metro Lines No.1 and No.3. The minimum distance between the excavation
and the tunnels of the new route of Shanghai Metro Line No.1 was only 2 m. In
addition, the excavation of the interchange station of Metro Lines No.1 and No.3 was

located besides this excavation in northwest and was constructed before this
excavation. The retaining structures of the two excavations were shared. Therefore, it
is important to predict the ground movement accurately in order to assess the impact of
the excavation on the metro tunnels and the existing excavation nearby.
Finite-element analyses have been used to study the performance of excavations as
the soil stress-strain behaviors can be considered and the construction sequences can
be modeled in the numerical modeling [3, 4, 6, 8, 10]. The constitutive models of
soils are most important in numerical analyses. Researchers showed that anisotropic
stress-strain strength of soft clays and nonlinear stiffness properties at small shear
strains have significant effect on the predicted wall deflections and soil movements
[7]. Generally, soils in Shanghai are sedimentary soils which are deposited through
the process of sedimentation followed by consolidation under accumulative
overburden pressures. Therefore, it may improve the prediction of ground movements
induced by excavation if considering the soils as anisotropic materials. In this paper,
the excavation of the North Square of Shanghai South Railway Station is studied by a
three-dimensional finite element modeling. Numerical analyses are conducted to
study the effect of anisotropic stiffness of soils on the computed ground deformation
around the excavation. The wall deflection and ground settlement for an isotropic case
and an anisotropic case are presented and compared with the field monitoring
measurements.

2 Site Description and Ground Conditions
The site in this paper is the excavation site of the north square underground shopping
center of Shanghai South Railway Station, which is located in the south of Shanghai.
Fig. 1 shows the layout of the excavation. The area of the site was about 40,000 m2. The
excavation was only about 3 m away from the existing tunnels of Shanghai Metro Line
No. 1 and No. 3, which were in the northwest and northeast side of the excavation,
respectively. The new route of Shanghai Metro Line No. 1 was in the east of the site.
The minimum distance between the excavation and the tunnels was only 2 m.

To monitor the performance of the excavation, a comprehensive monitoring system
was installed on site. As shown in Fig. 1, forty one inclinometers I1~I41 were
installed in the diaphragm walls to measure the rotation and deflections of the walls.
The inclinometer IT10 was installed adjacent to Line No. 1 to monitor the lateral
displacement induced by the excavation in the soil. Thirty one surface settlement
points were installed along the west boundary of the excavation (from point A to B to
C to D). The excavation was 12.5 m deep with two basement levels as shown in Fig. 2

and was constructed using the top-down method. The concrete floor slabs were
located at elevations of -3 m, -8.45 m and -14.7 m, respectively. The excavation was
supported by a 0.8 m thick concrete diaphragm wall. The depths of the walls were 24
m to 27.85 m. The site of the interchange station of Metro Line No. 1 and No. 3 was
adjacent to the excavation site and the retaining structures between the two
excavations were diaphragm walls.
The site is underlain by thick, relatively soft Quaternary alluvial and marine
deposits. Fig. 3 illustrates the succession of soil layers and the variation of soil
properties with depth. The soil properties include total unit weight, water contents,
void ratio, compression index, field vane shear strength, cohesion and friction angle.

3 Numerical Modeling of the Excavation
3.1 Finite Element Mesh and Boundary Conditions
In this paper, the finite element analysis program ABAQUS is used to conduct
numerical modeling. The meshes of the entire 3D-finite element model (1200 m × 500
m × 80 m) and the retaining structures are shown in Fig. 4. The three-dimensional
solid elements were used for soil layers. The columns and girders of the structure are
simulated by beam elements. The diaphragm walls and concrete floor slabs are
modeled using shell elements. The entire 3-D model consists of 178,162 nodes and
155,160 elements. The four side boundary surfaces are fixed along the vertical
direction and the direction perpendicular to each surface. The bottom boundary is
fixed in all x, y and z directions.

3.2 Soil Model and Parameters
In the numerical analyses, the diaphragm walls, the steel columns, the RC piles of the
foundation and the floor slabs are assumed to be linear-elastic materials with the
Young’s modulus of 30 GPa and the Poisson’s ratio of 0.2.
The numerical modeling includes establishment of the 3-D finite element mesh of
the complex shaped excavation with foundation piles and the detailed construction
process such as installing piles and retaining structures and zoned excavation is also
needed to be modeled. Therefore, it is reasonable to model soils as elastic materials
considering the complication and difficulties of modeling and the cost of computation
time. As the soils in the site are generally Quaternary alluvial and marine soils
deposited through the process of sedimentation followed by consolidation in
horizontal layers, two cases with isotropic and anisotropic soil properties are
conducted to study the effect of soil stiffness anisotropy. In the anisotropic case, it is
assumed that the soils are cross-anisotropic, in which the inherent anisotropy is
considered but the stress-induced anisotropy of the soil and the changes of the degree
of anisotropy due to excavation are ignored. For an idealized cross-anisotropic elastic
material, the stress-strain behavior is governed by five independent elastic parameters:
Eh, Ev, Gvh, νvh and νhh, where Eh and Ev are the Young’s moduli in the horizontal and
vertical directions, respectively; Gvh is the shear modulus in any vertical plane; νhh is
the Poisson’s ratio for the effect of horizontal strain on the complementary horizontal
strain; and νvh is the Poisson’s ratio for the effect of vertical strain on horizontal strain.
As the stress paths of the soil around the deep excavation correspond approximately
to triaxial extension, the extension moduli of the soils should be used in the numerical
analyses of excavation.

Becker [1] summarized undrained anisotropic elastic parameters for various clays.
The ratio of Eh/Ev ranges from 0.5 to 2.4, and the ratio of Gvh/Ev ranges from 0.23 to
0.44. Ng [9] compared compression modulus and extension modulus under drained
and undrained conditions. It shows the ratio of Ev/Ev’ ranges from 0.26 to 0.54, in
which Ev is the Young’s modulus of compression condition and Ev’ is the Young’s
modulus of extension condition. Lee [5] proposed that Gvh/Ev should be 40%-100% of
the value of G/E under isotropic condition. Large numbers of back analyses for the
excavations in Shanghai soft deposits indicate the vertical Young’s modulus Ev can be

taken as 4Ec, in which Ec is the modulus of compressibility. The modulus of
compressibility in this study (Table 1) is adopted from the ground investigation report
of the site. The ratios of Eh/Ev and Gvh/Ev of the soils in this study are assumed to be
0.6 and 0.26, respectively. For the isotropic case, the Young’s modulus E is equal to
Ev and the Poisson’s ratio ν is equal to νhh in Table 1.

3.3 Results and Discussion
The deformation of the soil adjacent to Metro tunnels may induce significant effects
on the Metro tunnels. Therefore, the soil deformation and structure displacement near
the Metro tunnels are studied here in detail.
Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) illustrate the calculated and field measured deformation at Stage
7 for the inclinometers I29 and IT10, respectively. The two inclinometers are very
close to the Metro Line No. 1. The maximum wall deflection occurs near the bottom
of the excavation. It shows that the wall deflection increases significantly with the
anisotropic soil stiffness parameters. The maximum computed wall deflection of the
anisotropic case is 37.5 mm, which is about 50% greater than that of the isotropic
case. The maximum difference between measurements and the computed wall
deflection of the anisotropic case is only 8%, while the maximum difference between
the measured and the computed deformation with the isotropic soil model is about
30%. The calculated ratio of maximum measured lateral wall deflection to the
excavation depth for the inclinometer I29 is 0.25%, which is within the range of the
reported values in [2]. For the anisotropic case and the isotropic case, the ratios of
maximum wall deflection to the excavation depth are 0.25% and 0.18%, respectively.
It shows that the anisotropy of soil properties should be considered for a more
accurate prediction of wall deflection.
The maximum value of the observed horizontal soil movement by IT10 is about 18
mm, which is much smaller than the maximum wall deflection of the inclinometer
I29. Therefore, the retaining structures of the excavation reduce the ground movement
and the deformation of the operating tunnels of Metro Line No. 1 is well controlled.
The computed maximum ground movement of the anisotropic case is 18.4 mm, while
the computed maximum ground movement of the isotropic case is only 14.7 mm. It
shows the numerical analysis with anisotropic soil parameters yield a more accurate
estimation of the lateral ground movement.

Fig. 6 presents the measured and calculated ground surface settlement along
ABCD near the Metro Line No. 1 at Stage 7. The measured settlement is 10.8 mm to
16.75 mm. The ground settlements near the corners of the excavation are generally
larger than the settlement at other locations. This is probably due to the arching effect
of the corner. The predicted ground settlement of the anisotropic case is slightly
smaller than the observed settlement. However, the maximum difference between the
computed settlement of the isotropic case and the measured values is approximately
50%. It shows that the soil models with anisotropic stiffness could improve the
accuracy of the prediction of the soil settlement around the excavation. The adopted
soil parameters for the anisotropic elastic model are shown to be reasonable for
Shanghai soils.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, a three-dimensional finite-element modeling is conducted to study the
performance and soil deformation of the excavation for the north square of Shanghai
South Railway Station. Two cases of numerical analyses with isotropic and
anisotropic soil stiffness parameters are conducted to study the effects of anisotropic
stiffness. It shows the anisotropic stiffness has significant effects on the computed
wall deflection and ground deformation induced by the excavation. The wall
deflection and ground lateral movement of the anisotropic case are significantly larger
than those obtained in the isotropic case. The use of the anisotropic soil model greatly
improves the accuracy of the estimated wall deflection and soil deformation around
excavation. The adopted soil parameters for the anisotropic elastic model in the
numerical modeling are shown to be reasonable for Shanghai soils.
