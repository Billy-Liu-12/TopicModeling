In this work, we consider three domains to conform the opinion. The first one is linked to the
technologies, and particularly the influence of the media, Internet, etc. in the public. Additionally, the
biological aspect linked to the brain, and in general, psychology of the individuals, is very important to
understand, in order to know the mechanism inside of each individual to build an opinion. Finally, the
social context also has its influence in the conformation of the opinion, the cultural, and social networks
are determinant for the conformation of the opinion. In this paper, we analyze these aspects, and propose
to represent them via a FCM model (Aguilar, 2004; Aguilar, 2010; Aguilar, 2013; Aguilar et al. 2016;
Chrysafiadi, 2013), which can be used to infer the evolution of an opinion in a given context, or to
understand why an opinion appears in a social context. The literature presents some papers about opinion
mining systems, but our approach is the first based on the concepts of FCM.

2 Characteristics of the human brain exploited by social media
Certain aspects, such as decontextualized feelings, moods and stress, have an important impact in
our form of understanding, behavior and opinion, and seem to be importantly influenced by the media,
as these affect important areas of human decision making and opinion formation. Reference (Aguilar &
Terán, 2015) describes two routes for appraisal: Bottom-up processes allow the individual to make
situational analysis, predominantly via its cerebral cortex. The top-down route or appraisal reinstatement
involves the limbic and the reptilian brains, and permits the individual to give meaning (simultaneously,
emotions appear) from similarity (association) of a current situation to a past situation, by prototypebased categorization. In the case of normal emotions, prototypes are defined on characteristics of events
and objects. Prototype-based categorization is exploited by the media, when establishing the Frames*,
in accordance to the Agenda-Setting† (see (Aguilar & Terán, 2015)).
Subliminal messages consist in stimulus (primus) involving a person for only a few milliseconds,
and are below the threshold of perception, or sensory awareness. Supraliminal messages involve people
for much longer periods of time than a few milliseconds, and are above the threshold of perception of a
stimulus. In subliminal messages awareness of the primes is blocked by a second message.
Consequently, the meaning is activated, but the memory is not informed about the origin of the meaning,
as this has been blocked. The prime (inappropriately) adheres to the subsequent messages/stimulus, so
that it is over-rated (either positively or negatively). Then concepts, categories and feeling originally
linked to the message, free-float and will be associated with other events or objects, and surprising
emotions as phobias could emerge. However, not only subliminal messages, but also supraliminal
messages whose context are poor, or inexistent, are often used by media for social manipulation, even
when in this case the local memory is informed, though inadequately.
The effect of media, via decontextualized and subliminal messages, conditions people. Conditioning
is understood as the association of a stimulus with a certain response of the human brain. There are two
paired stimulus: a stimulus that is innately or intrinsically aversive (or attractive), and a neutral stimulus.
After repetitively suffering the paired stimulus, a person becomes conditioned to generate the innate
response originally shown against the aversive stimulus also against the neutral stimulus presented
alone. Alike emotional conditioning, emotional contagion fundamentally has an unconscious character.
This human capacity seems to be innate, no learned (LeDoux, 2002). In general, many emotions are
transmitted via observation or indirect experience, as a complement to conditioning or direct experience.
It has been proved that the limbic system and in particular the amygdala, as well as the reptilian
system, are involved in social contagion of emotions, in animals and humans. For instance, in (Clore &
Frames are considered as spatial and temporal attachments (bonds) of a set of interactive messages
The Agenda-setting theory determines which stories will be newsworthy in accordance to the concern of powerful
actors such as transnational companies, governments of developed countries, and groups of interest. The Agenda is
implemented specially via Frames.

Ortony, 2000) has proven that in monkeys observation fear is similar to direct fear conditioning. Work
on mirror neurons fosters these findings. Mirror neurons are specialized neurons whose function is to
serve in human emotional contagion – they become active not only when humans get involved in an
activity, but also when humans observe or imagine the same activity done by others (by using, e.g., cell
phones, tweets, etc.). An important aspect in opinion contagion is the conformity effect: people tend to
see as the majority. Several findings support this fact. For instance: pain areas in the brain become
activated when one contradicts the majority (LeDoux, 2009). Consequently, to dissent from the others,
and get rejected from them, hurts, creates distress, and consequently individuals tend to prevent it.
In accordance with the Agenda, the media promotes decontextualized and subliminal messages, via
frames. These generate situations of meaning, and affective feelings (including emotions), without
appraisal/reasoning, which can create stress and raise certain moods (anxiety, for instance). All this
favors certain opinions. Such opinions generate social effects via contagion, feed-backing the described
process (through, for instance, the conformity effect), which afterwards strengthen such opinions.

3 Specification of Our Opinion Mining Model based on FCM
In our FCM, the concepts are distributed into four levels, where each level FCM describes one of
the aspects/dimensions to be considered in the conformation of the opinion, and the last one describes
the conformation of the opinion. This multilevel approach follows the classical structure of the
multilevel FCM approaches presented in the literature (Aguilar et al. 2016).
i) First Level: At this level, the concepts determine the conformation of public opinion, and the
causes of this conformation. These concepts are: a) Credibility or trust in the source: credibility of the
source will be the equivalent of trust in it; b) Socialization: it is the way in which culture is transmitted
from one generation to another, it is the way through which men learn their beliefs, opinions and
behaviors. Here the public opinion is assumed as the result of the majorities, generated within the
individuals; c) State of public opinion: this concept is linked to determine how the public opinion is
formed in that society, or in that social group, where the analysis takes place. It determines the level of
manipulation, lack of autonomy, local slates, to express their opinions; d) Conformity effect: describes
the conformation of the public opinions via contagion, etc. In this way, describe how the social pressure
from a majority group could affect a person to conform its opinion.
ii) Second Level: At this level belong the concepts that represent the different technological aspects
that influence the public opinion that are used like instruments to diffuse, to mold and to moderate the
opinion of the receivers: a) Old media: The old media influence society permanently, modifying their
ways of life, their choices, their customs, their interpretations, consumption and therefore public opinion.
The traditional media are: TV, Radio, Printed, as the newspapers or magazines; b) New media, or social
media and the Internet: it is a powerful tool that, in addition to allowing the diffusion of current media,
goes beyond, producing an information exchange in innovation, in unique ways that only occurs through
its use. Some of the aspects deployed on the Web are: The Web with marketing tools, advertising, per2per
exchange networks, blogs, etc.; Social networks like Twitter and Facebook; c) Agenda Setting: refers to
the selection of what should be attended by the public, what should be considered urgent, the issues that
should matter to all. All this is decided by the media. Some authors have established that there is a direct
relationship between people's perceptions about the importance of the issues addressed and the content
objectified in the media; d) Natural media: are the classic media created by the nature, the cultivation of
the earth, etc., linked to culture, in contraposition to the artificial society created by the current media.
iii) Third Level: At this level belong the concepts about the social aspects that influence the public
opinion: a) The Masses: The mass is composed of anonymous individuals with little or no interaction
between them, very heterogeneous (diverse status and professions), and very dispersed geographically;
b) Public: Some analysts relate the public with those individuals or groups who are actively involved in
the public debate of a particular issue. Other researchers regard the public as that sector of the population

	

Jose Aguilar et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 2522–2526

that seems informed and attentive to public issues; c) Crowd: is defined as the "law of the mental unity
of the multitudes": Individuals are not conscious and lack reflection as a unit, but in turn, the very unity
of the multitude is based on the fact that all its members are controlled by a common impulse evoked
by the reciprocal interaction of all its members; d) Social Structures derived from Political Activity, like
the state, the political parties, or the pressure Groups; e) Structures of the State, like the government
institutions, the educational institutions, etc.; e) Social structure due to the Social status: resulting from
the social class and condition. Social groups: in a chronological order, first the family, then the school,
and finally the social groups,
iv) Fourth level: At this level belongs the concepts about the biological aspects that influence the
public opinion: a) Psychological Influence: the psychology handles opinions, beliefs, meanings,
emotions and even behavior; b) Emotions: they are a complex feeling state that results in psychological
changes that influence thinking and behavior. Emotions, moods and feedback interact with each other;
c) Moods: These greatly affect a person's willingness to give meaning, and therefore their opinion and
emotions; d) Conditioning: in this concept we include all the forms and ways of conditioning of the
opinion of a person in a society, via the manipulation of the media (one of the most common), or any
other way, that removes its independence of opinion.

4 Experiments with our model
Our model is implemented in the FCM tool based on multilevel, called FCM Designer Tool
(Contreras & Aguilar, 2010). Our model is defined as a predictive model where the opinion is inferred
according to the current context of the set of concepts in each dimension. The set of concepts describes
public opinion, and we like to know/infer if the public opinion has not been manipulated.
To test our problem, we have considered the public opinions about the climate change. In this case,
we have defined two groups of data: to train and to test the capability of inference of our model. We
have used several training scenarios, two of them are: i) Scientific Community states that the world is
on the verge of another massive extinction of species; ii) The Spanish perception of the contribution of
countries to global warming. And, we use the next scenarios to test the predictive capability of our
FCM: i) Environmentalists say major powers limit the UN to curb climate change; ii) Global warming
is perceived by most as the biggest problem facing the planet.
For these scenarios, our model infers in the first level the next values (see table 1). Our system
determines that the credibility of the source in each case is good. This concept is very important to form
the public opinion. We see that socialization has not a good value, and maybe because some of the
following aspects have not influence in the final opinion: Spiral of silence, Pluralistic ignorance, Effect
of false consensus, and Perception of looking through glass. The state of public opinion and the
Conformity effect of the public opinion is correct in each case, which determine their conformation in the
society is correct. The FCM iterates until it reaches a balanced equilibrium, which is a state of the system
where each concept converge to a given value. This gives the evolution of each concept. We can analyze
the change in the value of a concept as a time series that describes its behavior in a given situation.
Analyzing this information, we can discover the real behavior of such concept, and the specific causal
relationship with the other concepts, which finally determines its impact in the conformation of the
opinion. In this way, we can determine the key element that influence in the conformation of the public
opinion, in order to act over them.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we have proposed an opinion mining model based on FCM, which allows navigating
over concepts linked to the conformation of the opinion in order to understand the dynamic of the
conformation of public opinion. Particularly, our model can infer opinions, and can be used to analyze
the dynamics of opinion conformation. For example, it can determine the more influence concepts on a
certain type of opinion, and it can predict the characteristics of a given opinion for a certain situation,
among other things. In this way, our model can be used in different ways, to explain an opinion, to
predict a future opinion, or to determine and recommend the aspect to be considered in a given situation
to avoid a bad public opinion, in a transparent way.
In the future work, the use the FCM implemented, to be tested in several scenarios using the FCM
Designer tool (Contreras & Aguilar, 2010). Additionally, define some metrics about the quality of the
opinion mining of the model, such as the Validity (explanations to allow a user to check the validity of
an inference); Persuasiveness (it determines if our model can change a person’s attitude or behavior),
among other important issues. Additionally, in the future work, we exploit the second capability, in
order to determine the factors described in the rest of the levels that determine the first level, which have
more influences in the process of the conformation of the public opinion.
