Abstract
Metacomputing, or network-based concurrent processing, has evolved over
the past decade from an experimental methodology to a mainstream technology.
We use the term metacomputing in a broad sense to include clusters of workstations with high-speed interconnects, loosely coupled local network clusters,
and wide area conﬁgurations spanning multiple architectures, machine ranges,
and administrative domains. These modes of distributed computing are proving
to be highly viable platforms for a wide range of applications, primarily in the
high-performance scientiﬁc computing domain, but also in other areas, notably
web search engines and large databases. From the systems point of view, metacomputing technologies are being driven primarily by new network and switch
technologies in closely coupled systems, and by software advances in protocols,
tools, and novel runtime paradigms. This short course will discuss two alternative approaches to metacomputing that the Harness and IceT projects are
investigating.
Harness is a metacomputing framework based on dynamic reconﬁgurability
and extensible distributed virtual machines. The Harness system seeks to achieve
two important goals. First, by enabling reconﬁguration of the facilities provided
by the virtual machine, Harness is able to provide specialized services appropriate
to the platform and adapt to new technological developments. Second, Harness
is able to adapt to application needs by conﬁguring the required support services and programming environments on demand. In this talk, we describe the
architecture and key features of Harness, and discuss preliminary experiences
with its use. IceT is a system being developed to support collaborative metacomputing. While the focus of Harness is on reconﬁgurability, IceT is aimed at
sharing of resources by merging and splitting virtual machines. Multiple users
owning diﬀerent sets of resources may occasionally pool them as problem situations dictate; IceT provides a structured framework and context for this type of
sharing, and addresses security and resource management issues. An overview
of the IceT system, and a discussion of its salient features will be presented in
this talk.
