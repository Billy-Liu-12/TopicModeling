Abstract. The performance of modern integrated circuits is often determined by
interconnect wiring requirements. Moreover, continuous scaling of VLSI
circuits leads to an increase in the influence of interconnects on system
performance. It is desired therefore, to calculate accurately its parasitic
components, particularly wiring capacitance. In order to recognize which one
from the most popular empirical approaches gives the evaluation of the total
capacitance that suits to the real capacitance of the interconnect line, the
numerical simulations based on the numerical solving of Maxwell equations
have been employed.

1 Introduction
Due to continually shrinking feature sizes, higher clock frequencies, and the
simultaneous growth in complexity, the role of interconnections in determining circuit
performance is growing in importance. This trend has led to the increasing dominance
of interconnect delay over logic propagation delay – even with new metal
technologies such as copper or new low-k dielectrics [1]. Additionally, increasingly
large chip dimensions result in the longer interconnect lines, which give considerable
contributions to the total power dissipation. Since the metallic interconnections are
the crucial design issue for current and future generation of IC’s, it is increasingly
important to compute accurately all its parasitic components, particularly wiring
capacitances. Their evaluation is a non-trivial task and it is a subject of many
investigations [2],[3],[4]. There are two major approaches to calculate the parasitic
capacitance. The first type is to use a numerical simulation, often based on Finite
Difference Time Domain or on Finite Element Method [5],[6]. The numerical
methods have good accuracy, however are too time-consuming, when applied to the
whole integrated circuit. The second approach uses analytic formulations, derived
from the equations of electromagnetism. These methods have a sufficient accuracy
and a simulation speed, but they can be considered to simulate a few physical
configurations, only. Empirical 2- and 3D capacitance models have been reported
extensively in the literature. In order to recognize which one from the most popular
approaches [7],[8],[9],[10] gives the evaluation of the total capacitance that suits to

the real capacitance of the interconnect line, the numerical simulations based on the
numerical solving of Maxwell equations have been employed. The simulations were
performed using the commercial software package OPERA [11], which uses finite
element techniques to analyze the electromagnetic problems.

2 Electrical Models of On-chip Interconnections
Initially, interconnect has been modeled as a single lumped capacitance in the analysis
of the performance of on-chip interconnects. Currently, at low frequency, the lumped
RC models are used for high-resistance nets (Fig.1a) and capacitance models are used
for less resistive interconnect [8],[12]. To represent the distributed nature of the wire,
the interconnect is broken down into n smaller lumped section (Fig.1b). The
simulation accuracy increases with increasing n. If the signal rise time is too short or
the wire is very long, the inductance must also be included and an RLC network
(Fig.1c), or the transmission line model (Fig.1d) must be used [13],[14]. The possible
representations of interconnect line models include the Π, L and T networks.

3 Analytical Models of Parasitic Interconnect Capacitance
An accurate model for the crossover capacitance is essential for estimating the
interconnect circuit performance. To get an accurate interconnect capacitance electric
field solvers (2D or 3D) should be used. It is, however, so huge task that it would take
ages to estimate the capacitance of the whole chip. Therefore, various assumptions
and approximations are used to get quick estimates. The empirical formulas, derived
from the equations of electromagnetism have the sufficient accuracy and the
simulation speed. The simplest equation for interconnect capacitance is given by.

where H is the interlayer dielectric (ILD) thickness, ε SiO2 is dielectric constant, εo is
the permittivity of free space, W and LInt are the width and the length of the
interconnect respectively.

Fig. 2. Interconnect capacitance components

For interconnections in modern integrated circuits a large part of the capacitance
comes from lateral coupling between adjacent wires placed on the same metal level
and from fringing fields This means that the values of extracted capacitance using
simple parallel plate capacitor approximations are extremely inaccurate. In reality, the
total interconnect capacitance is a sum of a few different capacitances resulting from
the particular design of interconnect system and cannot be treated as the simple plane
described by (1). As it is shown in Fig.2, one can distinguish the parallel plate
capacitance component, CP, the fringing field component, CF, and lateral coupling
capacitance component, CL. It should be noted, that if the neighbor line switches in
the opposite direction, the effective lateral capacitance doubles but if the neighbor line
switches in the same direction the effective lateral capacitance equals to zero.
There are several approaches to identify the total capacitance CTotal, which use
different models to define the components capacitances The most popular of them are
presented below. One of the first one was developed by Sarasvat [7]. He considered
the structure shown in Fig.2 and described the component capacitances as follows:

W
CP = εoxεo H

(2)

T
CL = εoxεo S

(3)

CTotal = k(2CP + 2CL)

(4)

where T - line thickness, S - distance between two adjacent wires and k - the factor
which takes into account the fringing fields, which value can be calculated using twodimensional analysis of Dang and Shigyo [15].
Another model was presented by Sakurai [8] who derived a simple analytical
formula for the total capacitance for symmetrical interlevel dielectric thickness.
However, this formula takes into account a basic wire structure with one ground plane
only. Because of the symmetrical nature of the interconnect structure considered in

4 Numerical Model of Parasitic Interconnect Capacitance
In order to recognize which from the above formulas gives the evaluation of the total
capacitance that suits to the real capacitance of the interconnect line, the numerical
simulations based on the numerical solving of Maxwell equations have been
employed. The simulations were performed using the Vector Field commercial
software package OPERA [11], which uses finite element method to analyze the
electromagnetic problems in 2D domain. This method divides the studied structure
into sub-domains. Then, it is possible, with this tool, to fit any polygonal shape by
choosing element shapes and sizes.

Fig. 3. Interconnect structure used in numerical capacitance calculation

The test interconnect structure is shown schematically in Fig.3. It contains three
wires sandwiched between a two ground planes. Three copper lines are imbedded in a
dielectric matrix (with the permittivity dependent on technology). The electric
potentials and the currents have been fixed to arbitrary values. The cross-section
dimension of investigated structure has been changed according to the technology.
Typical views of the field distributions are represented in Figure 3. The shades give
the intensity of the electric potential. This gives qualitative indications on the intensity
of the coupling strengths. The software reports the total charge on the strip in
Coulombs per meter. Since the total charge equals capacitance times voltage (CV= Q)
then we can interpret the results from the software directly as capacitance per meter.

5 Comparison Between Analytical and Numerical Models
The total capacitance was calculated numerically and using four formulas mentioned
above. Such a procedure has been repeated for several structures fabricated in 0.13,
0.10 and 0.05µm CMOS processes, which design parameters are collected in Table.1.

comparison one can judge that the empirical Chern’s formula that error value is less
then 8% over a wide range of interconnect parameters can be treated as the more
realistic one. It should be noted that the valid range of interconnect dimensions for
this formula is [9]:

noticed that the interconnect capacitance calculated for the present value of dielectric
constant 3.6 remains almost the same, while the capacitance calculated for the values
predicted by ITRS [1] tends to lessen.

6 Conclusion
The crossover parasitic interconnect capacitance is essential for estimating the
interconnect circuit performance. To get an accurate interconnect capacitance electric
field solvers should be used. Since it is too time-consuming, the empirical
approximations derived from the equations of electromagnetism are used.
Unfortunately these methods can be considered to simulate a few physical
configurations, only. In order to recognize which from the most popular approaches
gives the evaluation of the total capacitance that suits to the real capacitance of the
considered interconnect structure (Fig.2), the numerical simulations based on the
numerical solving of Maxwell equations have been employed. The presented
comparison showed that only for the Chern formula the error value is less then 7%
over a wide range of ITRS parameters. Therefore one can conclude that the Chern
formula is the most realistic one for the considered interconnect structure.
