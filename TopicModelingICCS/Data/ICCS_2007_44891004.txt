Abstract. Regional allocation of water pollution loading is an important
measure for achieving general quality and quantity control, which key problem
is allocating right weights to sub-regions. Information entropy method (IEM) is
proposed to mine the objective variation information of sub-regions and
experience information of decision makers during the allocation process. The
research results show that IEM is concise and universal, so it can be widely
applied to theory and practice of various systems engineering applications.
Keywords: Allocation weighting, Analytic hierarchy process, Principle of
minimum relative information entropy, Water pollution loads.

1 Introduction
Regional allocation of water pollution loading is important for achieving water
controls, ensuring a sustainable utilization of a water-based environment, and
supporting regional sustainable development [1]. Extant research methods are mostly
based on the principle of economic optimization, the principle of equitableness, and
the belief of both economic optimization and equitableness [2]. Using Delphi
techniques and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Li et al. argued for an
allocation method of permissible regional water pollution loads [2], which key
problem is how to conveniently determine allocation weights of sub-regions using
objective information of sub-regions and experience information of decision-makers.
Therefore, in this paper a method based on the relative information entropy principle
(IEM) is discussed for allocating permissible polluted water at regional levels.

2 Relative Information Entropy Method for Regional Allocation
of Water Pollution Loading
The establishment of IEM requires three steps, as follows.
Step 1: Establishing the hierarchy structure allocation model of region permissible
water pollution loading. In order not to lose universality, the hierarchy structure

model is constituted of, from top-down, goal level A, criterion level B, index level C,
and evaluated object level D.
Step 2: Determining the allocation weights of each sub-regions’ permissible water
pollution loading, yk, k=1-nd, where nd is the number of sub-regions. Because the ninepoint ratio-scale judgment matrix of AHP does not satisfy both linguistic and applied
conventions, we use the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix that conforms to
Chinese linguistic and cultural norms [3]. Evaluation is made of the importance of
each element in B-D levels for upper levels, and to establish judgment matrixes of B,

C and D level as follows: A={aij| i, j=1-nb}, Bk={b ij | i, j=1-nc•k=1-nb}, and Ck={c ij | i,
j=1-nd; k=1-nc} respectively. Where nb, nc and nd is the number of element B, C and D
level, respectively. For brevity, A is described as an example to explain the process of
computing weighting. According to Eq. (1), A can be changed into positive reciprocal
judgment matrix E with nine-point ratio scale:

⎧ (bm − 1)(ri − rj ) /(rmax − rmin ) + 1, ri ≥ rj
eij = ⎨
⎩1 /[(bm − 1)(ri − rj ) /(rmax − rmin ) + 1], ri < rj

each element of E is wk k=1-nb. If E satisfies the consistency condition, then

There is no general and precise scale to measure the priority of elements in the
system, AHP only requires E to satisfy consistency in order to adapt to different
complex useable systems. Therefore the left section of Eq. (2) can be considered as
some prior probability distribution of the random variable which is relative to E,
{wk|k=1-nb} can be computed according to the relative entropy principle [4].

When CIC<0.10, E can be considered as satisfying consistency. In a similar way, we
can calculate the weight of each element of each judgment matrix of C level

3 Case Study
A river channel-type reservoir receives the domestic sewage and industrial
wastewater from four cities in the drainage area. According to the goal of municipal
water-quality planning, we know that the permissible total water pollution loading of
chemical oxygen demanded organic pollutant (COD) of the water body is 35 000t/a
[2]. The goal level A of the hierarchy structure model is the allocation goal. B1, B2, B3
and B4 is social, economic, environmental, and technological & managing criterion
respectively. In the criterion level C, C1 is the proportion of non-farm population, C2
is the proportion of tertiary-industry employees, C3 is the unemployment rate of urban
workers and staff, C4 is the medical and health condition level, C5 is the social-culture
level, C6 is per capita gross domestic product, C7 is per capita revenue of the local
government, C8 is the efficiency of social labor, C9 is the area per capita income
level, C10 is the area per capita consuming level, C11 is the utilization and protection
ratio of water resource, C12 is the utilization ratio of carrying capacity of water
environment, C13 is wastewater discharge of output of ten thousand yuan, C14 is COD
discharge of output of ten thousand yuan, C15 is the urban sewage treatment rate, C16

is the industrial wastewater increasing to the standard rate, C17 is the wastewater reuse
rate, and C18 is advances in science and technology contribution rate. In the evaluated
object level D, D1 , D2 , D3 and D4 are the cities, respectively. According to the Table
1 of reference [2], we obtain the fuzzy complementary judgment matrixes of Level B,
C and D. Using IEM, we can get the weights from criteria 1 to criteria 4 of level B as
0.0625, 0.3125, 0.3125 and 0.3125 respectively, the total weight from C1 to C18
relative to the goal of level A as 0.0074, 0.0074, 0.0236, 0.0074, 0.0165, 0.1063,
0.1063, 0.0512, 0.0243, 0.0243, 0.1563, 0.1563, 0.0995, 0.0995, 0.0403, 0.0403,
0.0164 and 0.0164 respectively, the allocation weights from city 1 to city 4 as 0.178,
0.411, 0.186 and 0.225 respectively, and the permissible water pollution loading from
city 1 to 4 as 6 230, 14 385, 6 510 and 7 875 t/a respectively. The above results are
corresponds to those in [2]. According to the evaluated index values of each city in
the Table 1 in [2], comparatively speaking, each index value of city 2 is clearly
superior to that of the other three cities. Additionally, most of the indexes of city 4 are
superior to those of city 1 and city 3. Each index value of city 1 is noticeably inferior
to that of the other three cities.
