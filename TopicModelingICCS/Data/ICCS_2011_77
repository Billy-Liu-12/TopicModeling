Abstract
Hybrid systems are often used to describe many complex dynamic phenomena by combining multiple modes of
dynamics into whole systems. In this paper, we present a ﬂat Dirichlet process switching (FDPS) model that deﬁnes
a prior on mode switching dynamics of hybrid systems. Compared with the classical Markovian jump system (MJS)
models, the FDPS model is nonparametric and can be applied to the hybrid systems with an unbounded number of
potential modes. On the other hand, the probability structure of the new model is simpler and more ﬂexible than the
recently proposed hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) based MJS. Furthermore, we develop a Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating the states of hybrid systems with FDPS prior. And the numerical simulations
of a hybrid system in diﬀerent conditions are employed to show the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach.
Keywords: Dirichlet process, Markov chain Monte Carlo, hybrid system, Bayesian nonparametric estimation

1. Introduction
Hybrid systems (also known as multiple model systems) [1] are a very important class of models, which are
widely used in several ﬁelds of signal processing, including maneuvering target tracking [2], fault detection [3],
model reduction of molecular dynamics [4] and so on. The major diﬀerence between the hybrid systems and standard
dynamic systems with continuous state space is that a hybrid system combines hierarchically discrete/continuous state
spaces, and each discrete state (or called mode) is associated with a continuous-state dynamical process. The state
space model of the class of discrete-time hybrid systems under study here is given as below, and many hybrid systems
(e.g., the systems considered in [5, 6]) can be represented in this form:
xt+1
yt

=
=

f (θt+1 , xt , wt+1 )
,
g (θt , xt , vt )

t = 1, 2, . . . , T

(1)

where f is the transition function, g is the measurement function, xt ∈ Rnx is the base (continuous) state variable,
yt ∈ Rny is the available measurement, wt ∈ Rnw and vt ∈ Rnv are process and measurement noise, and θt ∈ Rnθ is the
modal (discrete) state variable. Neither the base state process x1:T nor the modal state process θ1:T is observed, and
only the noisy measurement process y1:T is available. The major challenge of estimation for hybrid systems arises
from the mode uncertainty, for it is impossible to investigate all the possible combinations of the modal states at
diﬀerent times.
In the research of hybrid systems, the most popular assumption concerning the mode is that the modal state process
is a Markov chain (MC), and the systems satisfying this assumption are called Markovian jump systems (MJSs)
[1, 7]. In the past, a variety of algorithms have been proposed for solving the state estimation problem of MJSs with
completely known transition probabilities of modal states. such as generalized pseudo-Bayes (GPB) [8], interacting
multiple model (IMM) [9] and expectation propagation (EP) [10] algorithms. And some researchers have proposed
the Bayesian estimation algorithms for the unknown transition probability matrices (TPMs) within the framework of
IMM [11, 7]. These algorithms approximate the posterior distributions of states by ﬁnite mixture models, and are able
to get the estimates with low computation costs. But they may fail if the mixture models cannot approximate the true
distributions accurately, especially when the system contains nonlinear/nonGaussian modes. To solve the problem of
estimation of more general hybrid systems, some Monte Carlo estimation techniques including Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) [12] and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) [6, 13] have attracted much attention in this ﬁeld. They
provide a ﬂexible framework to incorporate the heuristic approaches developed previously, and allow the Bayesian
estimation without any model approximation or linearization.
In recent years, the Dirichlet Process (DP) [14] approach has been one of the most important approaches to
nonparametric statistics. As a prior model of discrete distributions with inﬁnite components, DP provides a powerful
tool for Bayesian clustering and multiple model analysis. And the original DP has been used to estimate the Gaussian
mixture noise density of dynamic systems [15]. But only a few studies have investigated the application of DP in
general hybrid systems, and most of them are based on the hierarchical DPs (HDPs) proposed by Teh [16]. An HDP
model consists of multiple DPs which are organized in a hierarchical structure, and can be used to develop an inﬁnite
discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM). Fox [17, 18] modiﬁed the HDP-HMM and presented the HDP based
MJS. The major advantage of the HDP-MJS model is that both the number and the values of modes appearing in the
processes can be estimated in a purely Bayesian manner.
In this paper, we present an alternative and more ﬂexible DP prior model for hybrid systems with unknown mode
sets, and develop an MCMC algorithm for the Bayesian estimation of states. In comparison with the HDP-MJS, the
new model contains only one DP, which greatly simpliﬁes the probability model structure and makes the sampling
easier. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the basics of DPs and HDPs.
In Section 3, we propose the new DP model for mode switching of hybrid systems. After describing the model, in
Section 4 we present a Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MG) approach for state estimation, and in Section 5 provide results
from an example problem. In Section 6, we brieﬂy discuss the online estimation problem. Section 7 is a summary of
the work in this paper.
2. Background
In order to make the paper self-contained, we provide a brief overview of DPs and HDPs in this section.

2.1. Dirichlet processes
A DP is a probability measure on the space of probability measures. Let G0 be a probability measure on (T , A)
and α be a positive real number. We say a random measure G is distributed according to a DP with scaling parameter
α and base distribution G0 , denoted G ∼ DP (α, G0 ), if for any ﬁnite measurable partition {A1 , . . . , Ak } of T ,
(G (A1 ) , . . . , G (Ak )) ∼ D (αG0 (A1 ) , . . . , αG0 (Ak )) .
From the deﬁnition of DP, one can obtain two important equivalent descriptions of the DP model:
1. Stick-breaking representation. Sethuraman [19] proved that a G ∼ DP (α, G0 ) can be written in the explicit form
∞

k−1

G=

πk δηk ,
k=1

with

1 − πl

πk = πk

(2)

l=1
iid

iid

πk |α, G0 ∼ B (1, α) ,

ηk |α, G0 ∼ G0 .

According to (2), a realization of DP is discrete with probability one.
2. Blackwell-MacQueen urn scheme. Suppose we draw a G from DP (α, G0 ), and independently draw random variables {θt } from G:
G|α, G0

∼

DP (α, G0 ) ,

θt |G

iid

G.

∼

Integrating out G, the distributions of θ1 , θ2 , . . . can be provided by the Blackwell-MacQueen urn scheme [20]:
θt |θ1:t−1 , α, G0 ∼

1
t−1+α

t−1

δθl +
l=1

α
G0 .
t−1+α

(3)

(In this paper we denote the joint distribution of θ1:t deﬁned in (3) by pMDP (θ1:t |α, G0 ).) Thus, {θt } forms a stochastic
process. At each time t, θt takes a value from θ1:t−1 with a positive probability, and the probability is proportional
to the number of times the value has occurred.
2.2. Hierarchical Dirichlet processes
The HDP is an extension DP model for solving problems involving groups of data. The generative model for an
HDP is represented as
G0 |γ, H

∼

DP (γ, H) ,

Gi |αi , G0

ind

DP (αi , G0 ) ,

∼

i = 1, 2, . . .

Under this hierarchical structure, the base distribution for each Gi is also a realization of DP. Therefore all the Gi
share the common set of mixture components. The HDP can be applied to the Bayesian inference of HMMs, and the
resulting model is called HDP-HMM [16, 21]. Suppose that {θt } is the state sequence of an HMM with countable state
set Φ = {φ1 , φ2 , . . .} and Markov kernel K (φi , ·) = Pr (θt+1 ∈ ·|θt = φi ). Then the HDP can be used to construct the
prior models of {K (φi , ·)} under the case that both Φ and K are unknown, since all the K (φi , ·) have the same support
within the HDP prior model constraints.
3. Flat Dirichlet process switching model for hybrid systems
It is clear that the dynamics of the hybrid system deﬁned in (1) relies on the probability distribution of θ1:T , but
which is generally unknown in practical applications. As mentioned above, the HDP-HMM can be used to construct
a prior model for p(θ1:T ), if the total number of modes appearing in the process is uncertain. However, the HDPHMM involves multiple DPs which are associated with each other and form a hierarchical structure. It causes that the
estimation procedure is very complex with a large number of auxiliary variables. In this section, we develop a more
simple DP model for handling the mode switching dynamics.

3.1. Flat Dirichlet process switching model
Unlike the HDP-HMM, here we consider applying the DP model with base distribution G20 to the sequence of
transition pairs θ¯1:T instead of θ1:T , where G0 is a continuous distribution on Rnθ and θ¯t = θt , θt denotes the transition
pair from time t − 1 to time t. Certainly θt should satisfy
θt+1 = θt .

(4)

However, the realization of pMDP θ¯1:T |α, G20 does not satisfy (4) in the general case. Therefore we adopt the following
modiﬁed prior model of θ¯1:T :
⎛
⎜⎜ V θ¯1:T
¯θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d ∼ pFDPS θ¯1:T |α, G0 , σ2d ∝ exp ⎜⎜⎜⎜−
⎝
σ2d
where

T

⎞
⎟⎟⎟
⎟⎟⎟ pMDP θ¯1:T |α, G2

⎠

(5)

D−1 θt − θt+1 .

t=1

is an energy function which we use to impose the soft constraints θt+1 ≈ θt on the values of θ¯1:T , D ∈ Rnθ ×nθ is a
positive deﬁnite matrix, and σ2d is a small positive number. The model based on this prior with σ2d small enough tends
to make θt+1 and θt be approximately equal and could be therefore appropriate for describing the switching dynamics
of θ1:T .
Remark 1. Compared to the HDP-HMM, the structure of the prior deﬁned in (5) is “ﬂat” and only a single DP is
required. In this sense, we call the proposed model the ﬂat DP switching (FDPS) model.
This prior model can also explained by the following virtual model M:
G|α, G0

∼

DP α, G20 ,

θ¯t |G

iid

∼

G,

ut

iid

∼

N 0, σ2d D ,

yt

=

θt − θt+1 + ut ,

where ut is virtual noise and yt is a virtual noisy measurement of the diﬀerence between θt and θt+1 . It is obvious that
PFDPS is equal to the marginal conditional distribution of θ¯1:T given all yt = 0 under the virtual model, i.e.,
pFDPS θ¯1:T |α, G0 , σ2d = pM θ¯1:T |α, G0 , σ2d , y1:T −1 = 0
where pM denotes the distribution under model M.
Remark 2. If the discrete distribution G is given in the model M, the conditional distribution of θ¯1:T can be written
as
⎞
⎛
⎜⎜⎜ V θ¯1:T ⎟⎟⎟ T
⎟⎟⎟
G θ¯t .
pM θ¯1:T |G, σ2d , y1:T −1 = 0 ∝ exp ⎜⎜⎜⎝−
σ2 ⎠
d

t=1

The right-hand-side (rhs) of the equation consists of two terms. The ﬁrst term stands for the soft constraints. And the
second term is the product of weights of all the transition pairs deﬁned by the G, which is equivalent to a Boltzmann
chain model [22], which is an extension of MC. Therefore the proposed FDPS model can be treated as a prior for the
approximate Boltzmann chain model, and the resulted hybrid system model has more ﬂexibility than common MJS
models.
Remark 3. For simplicity, we assume that G0 = N(μ0 , Σ0 ) and D = Σ0 in this paper. Then θ1:T can be integrated out
in analysis and estimation.

3.2. Marginal distribution of FDPS model
We now consider the marginal distribution of the FDPS prior model:
pMFDPS θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d =

pFDPS θ¯1:T |α, G0 , σ2d dθ1:T = pM θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d , y1:T −1 = 0 .

(6)

Suppose that a given θ1:T has m distinct values {φ1 , . . . , φm }. Let ct denote the corresponding indicators with
ct = i ⇐⇒ θt = φi . It is obvious that the corresponding θ¯1:T also has m distinct values φ1 , φ1 , . . . , φm , φm and
satisﬁes θ¯t = φc , φct with probability one under model M. From the above, we have
t

pM θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d , y1:T −1 = 0

∝

pM y1:T −1 = 0, θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d

Note that the function integrated in the second term on the rhs represents an MVN distribution of φ1:m , φ1:m . Therefore we can get
pMFDPS θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d = pM θ1:T |α, G0 , σ2d , y1:T −1 = 0 =

Z α, σ2d , G0

pMDP (θ1:T |α, G0 ) pN (φ1:m |μr , Σr )

where μr ∈ Rmnθ and Σr ∈ Rmnθ ×mnθ are both functions of c1:T , σ2d , μ0 , Σ0 which can be easily computed by the
Kalman ﬁlter (KF) in practice, and Z α, σ2d , G0 denotes the normalized constant.
4. MCMC estimation
4.1. State estimation
In this subsection, we consider the Bayesian inference of both base and modal states of the hybrid system conditioned on the measurements under the FDPS prior with hyperparameters of the FDPS model assumed to be known.
(In the rest paper we will drop the hyperparameters of the FDPS model from the notation where there is no ambiguity.)
From the above results, the Bayesian inference relies on the posterior distribution
T

p (θ1:T , x1:T |y1:T ) ∝ γ (θ1:T , x1:T ) = pMFDPS (θ1:T )

ψt (θt , xt , xt−1 )

(8)

t=1

where
ψt (θt , xt , xt−1 ) =

p x1 (x1 |θ1 ) pg (y1 |x1 , θ1 ) ,
t=1
,
p f (xt |xt−1 , θt ) pg (yt |xt , θt ) , t > 1

p f denotes the transition probability density with xt |xt−1 , θt ∼ p f (xt |xt−1 , θt ), pg denotes the measurement probability
density with yt |xt , θt ∼ pg (yt |xt , θt ), and p x1 denotes the distribution of the initial state x1 with x1 |θ1 ∼ p x1 (x1 |θ1 ).
And the posterior can be approximated by MCMC methods based on MG sampling [23] method, which uses the
Metropolis sampling technique to draw each variable (or group of variables) from its conditional distribution while
holding all the other variables ﬁxed. For the estimation problem in this section, each iteration of the MG sampler
draws the following samples:
θ t:t+1 |θ−(t:t+1) , x1:T , y1:T for t = 1, . . . , T − 1. From (8), we have
p θt:t+1 |θ−(t:t+1) , x1:T , y1:T ∝ pMFDPS θt:t+1 |θ−(t:t+1) ψt (θt , xt , xt−1 ) ψt+1 (θt+1 , xt+1 , xt )

1398

H. Wu, F. Noé. / Procedia Computer Science 4(2011) 1393–1402

where pMFDPS θt:t+1 |θ−(t:t+1) is a ﬁnite mixture distribution of a discrete distribution and multiple MVN distributions,
and can be easily derived from the expression for pMFDPS (θ1:T ) in (7). Then we generate a new sample for θt:t+1 as
new
∼ pMFDPS θt:t+1 |θ−(t:t+1)
θt:t+1
new
with probability
and let θt:t+1 ← θt:t+1

ψt θtnew , xt , xt−1 ψt+1 θt+1
, xt+1 , xt

ψt (θt , xt , xt−1 ) ψt+1 (θt+1 , xt+1 , xt )

∧ 1.

Remark 4. Here we sample θt and θt+1 instead of a single θt at each time. The reason is that the variance of
pMFDPS (θt |θ−t ) is often very small during the sampling procedure due to the soft constraint θt ≈ θt+1 , and the sampler
thereafter may be ineﬃcient if we only sample a single θt at each time.
x t:t+L−1 |θ1:T , x−(t:t+L−1) , y1:T for t = 1, 1 + L, 1 + 2L, . . .. Here we adopt the similar strategy as in sampling θt ,
i.e., divide x1:T into blocks with length L and sample a block at each step. The conditional distribution of xt:t+L−1 is
t+L

p xt:t+L−1 |θ1:T , x−(t:t+L−1) , y1:T ∝

ψk (θk , xk , xk−1 ) .
k=t

And we can get an MVN distribution q xt which is an approximation of the conditional distribution by KF or unscented
Kalman ﬁlter (UKF) [24, 25]. Then we draw
new
∼ q xt:t+L−1 (xt:t+L−1 )
xt:t+L−1

and let xt:t+L−1 ← xt:t+L−1
with probability
new

φ1:m|c1:T , x1:T , y1:T . Here the deﬁnitions of φ1:m and c1:T are the same as in Subsection 3.2, and we will sample the
values of θ1:T with c1:T ﬁxed in this step. According to (7) and (8), the conditional distribution of φ1:m can be written
as

Then we draw

According to (9), we can also use KF or UKF to develop an MVN proposal qφ such that qφ (φ1:m ) ≈ p (φ1:m |c1:T , x1:T , y1:T )

4.2. Estimation of α and σ2d
We now consider the case that the hyperparameters α and σ2d are unknown. It seems reasonable to jointly estimate
hyperparameters and states by MG sampling based on
p α, σ2d |θ1:T , x1:T , y1:T = p α, σ2d |θ1:T ∝

p α, σ2d
Z α, σ2d , G0

pMDP (θ1:T |α, G0 ) pN (φ1:m |μr , Σr )

where p α, σ2d denotes the prior distribution of α and σ2d . But it is impossible to sample directly for Z α, σ2d , G0 is
intractable. So here we approximate the p α, σ2d by a discrete distribution
Nh

pˆ α, σ2d =
i=1

and draw

Nh

α, σ2d ∼ pˆ α, σ2d |θ1:T ∝
i=1

Nh αi ,σd,i

1
pMDP (θ1:T |αi , G0 ) pN (φ1:m |μr , Σr ) δαi ,σ2d,i α, σ2d
Zi

where αi , σ2d,i are Nh samples from p α, σ2d and Zi = Z αi , σ2d,i , G0 . Although the values of Zi are still unknown,
the modiﬁed Wang-Landau algorithm [26] can be utilized to get the approximates Zˆi ≈ Zi / j Z j through sampling.
(Due to space limitations, we omit details of the algorithm.)
Remark 5. Generally speaking, Nh should be large enough such that the discrete distribution can well approximate
the true distribution. If we apply the proposed method to estimate (μ0 , Σ0 ), which contains O n2θ random numbers,
the required value of Nh may be so large that the estimation approach implemented here is impractical. So how to
achieve the Bayesian inference of all the hyperparameters of FDPS model remains an open problem. And μ0 , Σ0 are
set by trials and errors in this paper.

modes φ1 = (1, 0), φ2 = (1, 3) and φ3 = (0.5, 0). In simulations, θ1:T are generated according to the following two

[28], where the iteration number is the same. (For this case, the classical MJS model is “more exact” than the HDPHMM based model since the number of modes is set correctly.)
We repeated the simulation and estimation procedures 50 times. Table 1 summarizes the performance of the FDPS
and classical MJS models. The table shows the means and variances of the mean square errors (MSEs) of the state
estimates, where

Fig. 1 shows the estimation results of modal states obtained from a single run of M1 and M2. Note that the MJS
model with 3 modes is an “exact” prior model of M1. By contrast, the proposed FDPS model achieves the similar
estimation performance for M1 with the number of modes unknown. For the nonMarkovian jump system model M2,
the FDPS model outperforms the MJS model, especially in the mode estimation. This demonstrates the robustness
and ﬂexibility of the FPF, (see Remark 2). Moreover, in the simulations in Fig. 1, there are 9 diﬀerent transition pairs
in {θ1:T } (φ1 → φ1 , φ1 → φ2 , . . . , φ3 → φ3 ), and the FDPS model can get the correct number in most samples.
6. SMC for online estimation
In some applications, the states of the systems are required to be estimated online. For these cases, we can apply
the SMC method to sampling sequentially from distributions {p (θ1:t , x1:t |y1:t ) ∝ γ (θ1:t , x1:t ) |t = 1, 2, . . .}.
For the general JMS model, the SMC method performs online sampling based on the following recursive equation:
p (θ1:t , x1:t |y1:t ) ∝ ψ (θt , xt , xt−1 ) p (θt |θ1:t−1 ) p (θ1:t−1 , x1:t−1 |y1:t−1 ) .
However, in the proposed FDPS based hybrid system model, pMFDPS (θ1:t ) cannot be expressed as pMFDPS (θ1:t ) =
pMFDPS (θ1:t−1 ) pMFDPS (θt |θ1:t−1 ) for pMFDPS (θ1:t ) dθt
pMFDPS (θ1:t−1 ). Therefore (8) is not a generative but a discriminative probabilistic model, and the estimates cannot be calculated by the ordinary SMC method for JMS models
directly. Fortunately, the posterior distributions of states can be converted into a generative form by applying the
virtual model M. From (6), we have
γ (θ1:t , x1:t )

∝

pM θ1:t , x1:t |y1:t , y1:t−1 = 0

∝

ψ (θt , xt , xt−1 ) pM θt , yt−1 = 0|θ1:t−1 pM θ1:t−1 , x1:t−1 |y1:t−1 , y1:t−2 = 0

and the pM θt , yt−1 = 0|θ1:t−1 can be recursively computed by KF. Then we can develop the SMC method for FDPS
based hybrid system models (details will be given elsewhere).
7. Conclusions
In this paper, we have developed a Bayesian nonparametric model and estimator for hybrid systems with unknown
mode sets. The main diﬀerence between our approach and other nonparametric approaches is that we utilize the DP

to model the distribution of mode transition pairs instead of individual modes. Consequently the proposed FDPS
prior does not need multiple DPs as the HDP prior, and the corresponding probability model of hybrid systems is
greatly simpliﬁed and more ﬂexible. Using the MCMC method, we may eﬃciently compute state estimates from
noisy measurements. Future work will concentrate on schemes for Bayesian inference of the whole hyperparameters
of FDPS model. It would also be important to improve the estimation performance by some new sampling techniques.
