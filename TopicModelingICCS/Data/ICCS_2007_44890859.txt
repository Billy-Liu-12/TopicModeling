Abstract. In power-limited Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is important to
reduce the communication load in order to achieve energy savings. This paper
applies a novel statistic method to estimate the parameters based on the realtime data measured by local sensors. Instead of transmitting large real-time
data, we proposed to transmit the small amount of dynamic parameters by
exploiting both temporal and spatial correlation within and between sensor
clusters. The temporal correlation is built on the level-1 Bayesian model at each
sensor to predict local readings. Each local sensor transmits their local
parameters learned from historical measurement data to their cluster heads
which account for the spatial correlation and summarize the regional parameters
based on level-2 Bayesian model. Finally, the cluster heads transmit the
regional parameters to the sink node. By utilizing this statistical method, the
sink node can predict the sensor measurements within a specified period
without directly communicating with local sensors. We show that this approach
can dramatically reduce the amount of communication load in data query
applications and achieve significant energy savings.

1 Introduction
In most WSN applications, the typical scenario is to collect and transmit the measured
data from each sensor to the centralized sink where the data will be processed and
analyzed. However, sensor nodes might be far away from the sink and have to send
tremendous real-time data by multiple hops to the sink, which consume significant energy
resources. Therefore, to save energy is to reasonably reduce the communication load
from the local sensors to the sink.
Statistical modeling techniques have been applied to sensor network query systems
[1-3]. However, these studies did not support data queries with specified error bound
or clustering structure. Also, they undergo a heavyweight learning phase.
Autoregressive multilevel Bayesian models have been widely used outside the

wireless sensor network domain as a way to approximate and summarize time series
in many application domains such as finance, communication, weather prediction [1415]. In this paper, we applied the multilevel Bayesian statistical model to predict
sensor values based on multilevel clustering architecture instead of transmitting the
real time data directly to sink by each sensor. These techniques take advantages of the
recent historical readings to predict the most likely future values. It can drastically
reduce the amount of communication from sensors to the sink, detect the abnormal
data, and accommodate missing sensor data.
Clustering techniques have also been used in WSN. Many clustering techniques
such as K-mean, C-mean, or hierarchical clustering [4-8] have been proposed to
improve network performance and save energy in WSN. We propose a query-based
two-level clustering structure with consideration of both temporal and spatial
correlation, which matches the generic WSN topology. In the following sections, we
first present two-level network architecture and discuss the data query in section II. A
detailed multilevel Bayesian modeling approach to WSN data query is discussed in
section III. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach by the simulation in
section IV. Conclusions are reached in the last section.

2 Two Level Network Architecture and Data Query
Hierarchical (clustering) techniques can aid in reducing useful energy consumption
[4]. In our proposed hierarchical network structure, the sensor with the highest
number of neighbors was selected as the temporary cluster center. Other sensors
within a defined radius are then removed and the algorithm looks for a new sensor
with the highest number of neighbors. This continues until most sensors are clustered.
In our algorithm, the sensor in the cluster with the highest remaining energy is
selected as the cluster head. Once the selected cluster heads run out of battery, the
new cluster heads will be selected. By this approach, the network is formed into a
two-level network architecture. Each sensor joins a local cluster group, forming the
level-1(i.e., the sensor level) structure; all the cluster heads form the second tier multihop network structure at the cluster level. In this two-level clustering-based network
structure, the typical data query application scenario is described as follows: When
users submit a query to the sink, each sensor at level-1 senses the local phenomena,
sending the sample data to the cluster head. At level-2, the cluster heads summarize
these local data, sending them to the sink by one hop or multiple hops. However, in
our approach, local sensors and cluster heads only transmit Bayesian model
parameters inferred from the historical data instead of transmitting the real-time
readings to the sink. All user queries can be answered at the sink within the specified
time interval.
Our two level WSN model consists of a dynamic set of sensors denoted by S, and
one sink node. This set of sensors form different clusters {S1 , S 2 ......Sn } and all clusters

have dynamic cluster heads {Cs1 , Cs 2 ......Csn } by the algorithm we discussed above.
Each sensor senses and performs readings on M physical phenomena metrics

{M 1 , M 2 ......M n } over time. We assume that each sensor performs a reading on each

M i every T time units. Queries are executed at the sink. The typical query forms are

designed as follows:
SELECT Sensors WHERE R(M1, M 2....Mn) ERROR X CONFIDENCE d % Where REGION = Re gion1

Where R( M 1, M 2....Mn) predicted the values of M 1, M 2....Mn based on the multilevel
modeling. X represents an error bound required by the user in the query. The d% is
confidence ratio that denotes at least of d% the readings should be within X of their
true value, and REGION gives geographical location restrictions of sensor groups.

3 Bayesian Multilevel Modeling in WSN
In this paper, the Bayesian multilevel modeling approach is applied for this two-level
generic WSN architecture. The time series measurement model is at level-1 and the
Bayesian parameters are transmitted to its cluster head. All cluster heads collect these
parameters, inferring the level-2 Bayesian parameters at the cluster level and
transmitting them to the sink. When users submit a data query, the sink predictor can
answer it within the specified time period.
The level-1 model is expressed as

Ytij = β 0ij + β1ij T + β 2ij T + etij , etij ∼ N (0, Σ )
L1

(1)

L1

where Ytij denotes the level-1 (L1) measurement outcomes (e.g., temperature or
humidity) at time t for senor i in cluster j; β0i j is the initial status of sensor i of cluster
j; β1ij and β2ij denote the change rates and acceleration rates associated with time T
and quadratic term T2, respectively. The level-1 errors, etij, are normally distributed
with mean of 0 and covariance matrix Σ under first-autoregressive assumption
(AR(1)) which consists of variance, σ2, and covariance of
2

Cov (etij , et ′ij ) = σ ρ

t −t ′

(2)

where |t – t′| is the lag between two time points; ρ is the auto-correlation and σ2 is the
level-1 variance at each time point. In Bayesian notation, the observer data, Y are
distributed according to f (Y | B, Σ) , where f is the normal density, B denotes the

β parameters. The outcomes YtijL1 are assumed independently normally distributed
with mean of
E (Ytij | B , Σ ) = β 0 ij + β1ij T + β 2 ijT

and the covariance matrix Σ . The level-2 model is expressed as

In Bayesian notation, this specifies the prior p ( B | Λ, G ) where BL2 are the
level-2 (L2) outcomes, containing the same β parameters (3×1) as shown in level-1
model, representing the initial status, linear change rate and acceleration (or
deceleration) rate of individual sensor i of cluster j; Λ is a (3×q) matrix of
γ parameters, representing the average initial status (e.g., the initial temperature or
L2

humidity) ( γ 00 j ), linear change rates ( γ 10 j ) and the acceleration rates ( γ 20 j ) of

cluster j, as well as other γ parameters associated with level-2 q×1 predictors (X) ,
collected by cluster head j; u denotes level-2 random effects (or random errors),
multivariately and normally distributed with a mean vector of 0 and G covariance
matrix.
The Bayesian method requires to know the joint distribution of the data Y and
unknown parameters, θ, which denotes both fixed coefficients γ and covariance
matrix ψ (including G and Σ ) in our study. The joint distribution can be written as:
P(Y , θ ) = P(θ ) P(Y |θ )

(5)

where P (θ) is called the prior and P (Y| θ) is called the likelihood. As we observed
the data Y, Bayes’ Theorem was used to get the posterior distribution as follows:
P(θ | Y ) =

P (θ ) P(Y | θ )

∫ P(θ ) P(Y | θ )dθ

(6)

specifically,
P(γ ,ψ | Y ) =

(7)

are of primary interest, we have
P(γ | Y ) = ∫ p(γ ,ψ | Y )dψ

(8)

In general, analytically performing the above integration has been a source of
difficulty in application of Bayesian inference and often Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulation is one way to evaluate the integrals. In this study, we used one of
MCMC procedures, Metropolis-Hastings sampling procedure, to implement this
approximation [16-18].

4 Simulation and Analysis
We used SAS software [10] to simulate and test our approach. Our simulation was
based on 50 random deployed sensors. With our clustering algorithm, all sensors form
Cluster A and B. Cluster A has 20 sensors deployed while Cluster B has 30 sensors.
The temperature data were collected at different clusters across different areas with a
significant temperature difference. In our simulation, we used the first order radio
model presented in [4]. In the specified radio model, the radio dissipates Eelec = 50
nJ/bit to run the transmitter or receiver circuitry and Eamp = 100 pJ/bit/m2 for the
transmit amplifier. To transmit a k-bit message a distance d meters, ETx was used by
sensors. To receive a message, the sensors spent ER .

Etx ( k , d ) = Eelec ⋅ k + Eamp ⋅ k ⋅ d 2

(9)

Erx ( k , d ) = Eelec ⋅ k

(10)

After the clusters were formed and cluster heads were selected, the sink calculated
the routing hops among cluster heads. In addition, an index matrix was created for
time, area and sensor IDs. The two measured areas represented by the two sensor
class heads were coded as 0 and 1, respectively. Individual sensors (IDs) were
considered nested within each cluster represented by corresponding cluster heads, for
instance, sensor IDs ranged from 1 to 20 for Class Head 1, and 21 to 50 for Class
Head 2. Time started from 0 and extended to the assumed 14.5 hours with 0.5 hour
interval. Based on Model (4), a univariate response vector of yti was created. For
example, each sensor might have had 30 half-hour time points and one cluster had 20
sensors while the other had 30 sensors. The data generator [11-12] was validated with
parameter estimates from Potthoff and Roy’s data[13]. Table 1 presents partial local
parameters generated by each sensor at level-1, to be transmitted to the cluster heads.

Similarly, Table 2 shows the level-2 Bayesian model parameters based on the local
colleted data, to be transmitted to the sink. The parameters β0, βs, and βa represent the
initial temperature, linear change rate and deceleration rate at the two areas,
respectively. Based on these parameters, the sink predicts the next half hour
temperature value.
Table 3 gives partial predicted temperatures at the sink with error bound and
confidential interval, which responds to the queries submitted by the user at the sink.

Figure 1 (a) indicates the predicted temperature values of 20 sensors at each .5 hour
in Cluster A and the solid red line represents the estimated temperature by Cluster
Head A over 14.5 hours. Figure 1(b) presents the predicted temperature of each sensor
and the green line is the temperature trajectory estimated at the corresponding cluster
head in Cluster B within the same time interval. To show the significant temperature
difference in the two areas, we compare the estimated temperature of the two areas in
Figure 1 (c).
Figure 1(d) presents the residuals of the predicted values of each sensor. We found
that all the predicted values were controlled within the ± 1.5 standard deviation. This
simulation shows that our approach can satisfy the user controllable error bound
requirements. We also compared the energy consumption with the general approach
based on 50 random deployed sensors based on equation (9) and (10) within
14.5hours time interval. We compared the general data aggregation approach with our
multilevel Bayesian approach in the same WSN topology and found that our approach
has slightly higher energy consumption than General Data aggregation approach in
the initial 1.5 hour time window. That is because the Bayesian model needs to

transmit more parameters than real temperature data at the beginning, however, with
longer time period (1.5-14.5 hours), our approach has achieved significantly less
energy consumption than the linear-increasing energy consumption of the General
Data Aggregation approach when no parameters update is needed.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a multilevel Bayesian modeling approach to the query
application in the WSN multilevel architecture, utilizing both temporal and spatial
correlation to predict parameters at different levels. Our approach relies mostly on
local Bayesian models computed and maintained at each sensor. In order to adapt the
local model to variations in the data distribution, each sensor continuously maintains
its local model, and notifies the sink only of significant changes. As we showed, our

approach can provide a significant reduction in communication load over the existing
general data aggregation approach, and can also effectively predict future values with
controllable error bounds. By using this approach, significant energy consumption is
saved in typical data query applications.
