Abstract
In many biologically relevant situations, cells of a clonal population show a heterogeneous response upon a common stimulus. The computational analysis of such situations requires the study of cell-cell variability and modeling
of heterogeneous cell populations. In this work, we consider populations where the behavior of every single cell can
be described by a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Heterogeneity among individual cells is modeled via
diﬀerences in parameter values and initial conditions. Both are subject to a distribution function which is part of the
cell population model.
We present a novel approach to estimate the distribution of parameters and initial conditions from single cell
measurements, e.g. ﬂow cytometry and cytometric ﬂuorescence microscopy. Therefore, a maximum likelihood estimator for the distribution is derived. The resulting optimization problem is reformulated via a parameterization of the
distribution of parameters and initial conditions to allow the use of convex optimization techniques.
To evaluate the proposed method, artiﬁcial data from a model of TNF signal transduction are considered. It is
shown that the proposed method yields a good estimate of the parameter distributions in case of a limited amount of
noise corrupted data.

1. Introduction
Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of
intracellular pathways within a ”typical cell”. Unfortunately, experimental data used to calibrate the models are in
general obtained using averaged cell population data, e.g. western blot measurements. If the studied population is
highly heterogeneous, meaning that there is a large cell-cell variability, ﬁtting a single cell model to cell population
data can lead to biologically meaningless results. In oder to understand the dynamical behavior of heterogeneous cell
populations it is crucial to develop integrated cell population models, describing the whole population and not only a
single individual.

Modeling on the population scale has already been addressed by Mantzaris [1] and Munsky et al. [2]. These
authors demonstrated that populations can show a bimodal response if stochasticity in biochemical reactions is considered. But besides stochasticity in biochemical reactions there are other reasons which can also lead to heterogeneity
in populations. Examples are unequal partitioning of cellular material at cell division [1], or genetic and epigenetic
diﬀerences [3].
For the purpose of this paper, heterogeneity in populations is modeled by diﬀerences in parameter values of the
model describing the single cell dynamics [4, 5], whereas the network structure is assumed to be identical in all cells.
The distribution of parameter values and initial conditions within the cell population of interest is described by a
multivariate distribution function, which is part of the cell population model. This parametric approach is well suited
for modeling of genetic and epigenetic diﬀerences.
In the following the problem of estimating the distribution function of the parameters is studied. Therefore, experimental data obtained via ﬂow cytometry or cytometric ﬂuorescence microscopy are considered. These measurement
devices provide single cell data using ﬂuorescently labeled antibodies [6].
To estimate the parameter distributions, in a ﬁrst step, an appropriate population model has to be selected. In
literature mathematical models of cell populations are either described as cell ensembles [2, 4], or as a non-linear
partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) for the probability distributions of the state variables [1, 5, 7, 8]. In case of ensemble
models, a diﬀerential equation is assigned to each cell. PDE models describing the time evolution of the distributions
of the state variables are easy to handle from a theoretical point of view but hard to simulate for medium and large
scale single cell models. Therefore, besides in [5] only low dimensional PDE models of populations have been studied
in literature so far [1, 7, 9].
In this paper a model describing the state and output distribution functions within a heterogeneous cell population
is derived. Therefore, a cell ensemble model is used in combination with classical density estimation [10]. With this
approach, the state and output distribution within the population can be determined using only the single cell model
and the parameter distribution.
Employing this eﬃcient computation scheme for the population response a novel estimation method is developed.
The joint likelihood of parameter distribution and data is derived, based on which the maximum likelihood estimate
of the parameter distribution is determined. It is shown that the problem of determining the maximum likelihood
estimate of the parameter distribution function is a convex problem and can be solved eﬃciently.
Compared to the classical approach for parameter estimation in populations [4, 5, 7, 9], the proposed method
does not rely on the approximation of the output distribution at every measurement instance. Therefore, the proposed
scheme can directly use the measured data without any approximation. This allows to obtain a good approximation
of the parameter distribution with a smaller number of single cell measurements compared to the other approaches.
Additionally, a very realistic measurement noise model is considered [5].
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the problem of estimating the parameter distribution is introduced.
In Section 3, we present the simulation model for state and output distribution. Section 4 describes the proposed
identiﬁcation procedure and in Section 5 the method is applied to a TNF signal transduction model.
2. Problem statement
For the purpose of this work, a model of a biochemical reaction network in a population of N cells is given by the
collection of diﬀerential equations
x˙(i) = F(x(i) , p(i) ), x(i) (0) = x0 (p(i) ),
(1)
y(i) = H(x(i) , p(i) ), i ∈ {1, . . . , N}
(i)
∈ Rq+ . The vector ﬁeld F :
with state variables x(i) (t) ∈ Rn+ , measured variables y(i) (t) ∈ Rm
+ , and parameters p

R+ × R+ → R is Lipschitz continuous and the functions H : R+ × R+ → R+ and x0 : Rq+ → Rn+ are continuous. In
case concentration xk(i) is measured via ﬂow cytrometry y(i) = H(x(i) , p(i) ) = cxk(i) , where c is a proportionality factor.
The index i speciﬁes the individual cells within the population. The parameters p(i) can be kinetic constants, e.g.
reaction rates or binding aﬃnities. Cell-cell interactions are assumed to be negligible for the considered pathway,
which is the case in many in vitro lab experiments.
Heterogeneity within the cell population is modeled by diﬀerences in parameter values among individual cells.
The distribution of the parameters p(i) is given by a probability density function Φ : Rq+ → R+ , with Rq Φ(p)d p = 1.

In this paper measurement devices which provide single cell data
Di = ti , y¯ (i) (ti ) ,

i = 1, . . . , M,

(3)

are considered, such as ﬂow cytometry and ﬂow ﬂuorescence microscopy. Here y¯ (i) (ti ) is the measured output of the
cell i at the time cell i is measured, ti . M is the total number of measured cells. The complete set of data is denoted by
D = {Di }i∈{1,...,M} = ti , y¯ (i) (ti )

i∈{1,...,M}

.

(4)

Note that for the considered experimental devices, cells cannot be tracked over time, and are removed from the
population in order to obtain the measurements. Thus, only one data point for each cell is taken, and in particular
no single-cell time series data are available. On the other hand, the samples drawn from the cell population are
independent and identically distributed. Contrary to previous work [5, 7], it is not assumed that M is large enough to
determine an approximate of the output distribution.
Like most data also the considered single cell data are subject to noise. For the rest of the paper, noise consisting
of a relative and an absolute component is considered,
y¯ (i) (ti ) = diag(η1 )y(i) (ti ) + η2 ,

(5)

in which y¯ (i) is the measured output, y(i) is the actual output, and η j ∈ Rm is a vector of log-normally distributed
random variables with probability density functions

log-normal, which is a good model for the commonly seen noise distributions of the considered measurement device.
Additionally, the property that all outputs are positive is conserved. For notational simplicity the measurement errors
of the diﬀerent outputs are assumed to be independent.
Given this setup the problem we are concerned with is:

Problem 1. Given the measurement data D, the cell population model (1), and the noise model (6), determine the
parameter distribution Φ.
Unfortunately, estimation of Φ using a cell population model (1) with a ﬁnite number of cells and discrete sampled
data (4) is fairly diﬃcult as no single cell trajectories are available. A more natural approach is to use a distribution
description of the response of the cell population (1), in particular as the number of cells considered in a standard lab
experiment is of the order 109 and hence nevertheless too large to be simulated on an individual basis. In the next
section a model for the output distribution function of the cell population is introduced.
3. Modeling and simulation of heterogeneous cell populations
As outlined in the previous section, ensemble models are diﬃcult to analyze in the context of cell population
studies. Continuous statistical model in which states/outputs of the population are described by probability densities
deﬁned on the state/output space are preferable. Therefore, a model for the output distribution Υ(y|t, Φ) is derived,

within the model [5]. Based on this density function Υ, the probability of picking at random a cell from the population
with outputs y(i) (t) ∈ Y ⊂ Rm , where Y is an arbitrary set in the output space, is given by
Pr(y(i) (t) ∈ Y) =

For the computation of the output distribution Υ(y|t, Φ) a kernel density estimator is used. Kernel density estimators are non-parametric approaches to estimate probability distributions from sampled data [10]. They are widely used
and can be thought of as placing probability ”bumps” at each observation, as depicted in Figure 1. These ”bumps” are
the kernel functions K, with Rm Kdy = 1. In this work log-normal kernels,

is chosen.
To compute the cell population response for a given parameter distribution Φ(p), S independent single cell trajectories y(i) (t) of the cell population (1) are calculated. The parameters for these cells are sampled from the parameter
distribution Φ and the initial conditions computed according to x0 (p(i) ). Given this set of single cell trajectories an
approximation of the output distribution of the cell population is given by
Υ(y|t, Φ) =

Similar approaches have also been employed in [4, 5].
Note that selection of the smoothing parameter h is crucial and depends strongly on S . There are rules-of-thumb
available [10], as used here, but also the least-squares cross-validation method [11] can be employed.
4. Estimation of parameter distribution
In the previous section a method to determine the output distribution within the cell population is presented. Unfortunately, in order to simulate the population the parameter distribution Φ has to be known. Therefore, a maximum
likelihood approach for estimating Φ is developed next.

4.1. Likelihood function and corresponding optimization problem
To determine an estimate of the actual parameter distribution Φ(p), at ﬁrst the likelihood function L(Φ), which
gives the likelihood of a particular parameter distribution with respect to the data D, is required. As the measurements
are independently and identically distributed the likelihood of Φ is
M

fΦ (Di ),

L(Φ) =

(11)

i=1

in which fΦ (Di ) is the conditional probability density function of measuring Di = (ti , y¯ i ) given Φ. For this system
fΦ (Di ) is given by
fΦ (Di ) =

fy (¯y(i) )Υ(y|ti , Φ)dy.

Rm
+

(12)

The conditional probability density fy (¯y(i) ) is the probability density of measuring y¯ (i) given y. According to the
measurement noise model (5),
m

fy (¯y(i) ) =

fyk (¯y(i)
k ),

(13)

k=1

in which fyk (¯y(i)
k ) is the value of the line integral
fyk (¯y(i)
k )=

y¯ k(i) /yk

(14)

For this line integral no explicit solution has been found and therefore it is evaluated numerically using the adaptive
Simpson quadrature method [12] implemented in MATLAB.
Given this formulation of the likelihood and the conditional probability distributions, the maximum likelihood
estimate Φ∗ of the parameter distribution is the solution of the constraint optimization problem

maximize

Φ(p)d p = 1

(15)

Φ(p) ≥ 0 ∀p ∈ Rq+ .

Here, the log-likelihood is maximized and the two constraints ensure that Φ is a probability density. Unfortunately,
(15) is inﬁnite dimensional and thus not computable numerically.
4.2. Parameterization of parameter distribution Φ
To avoid the inﬁnite dimensional optimization problem (15), the parameter distribution Φ is parameterized according to
nϕ

Φϕ (p) =

ϕ j Λ j (p).

(16)

j=1

Here Λ j (p), j = 1, . . . , nϕ are ansatz functions for Φ, with Λ j : Rq+ → R+ and Rq Λi (p)d p = 1. Note that not only
+
Φ but also the ansatz functions Λ j are probability density functions. The weighting vector for the ansatz functions is
denoted by ϕ ∈ [0, 1]nϕ where nϕ is the number of ansatz functions. In this work, Gaussian distributions are used as
ansatz function but the presented approach is independent of the exact choice of ansatz functions.
Given a parameterization of Φϕ the output distribution can be written as
nϕ

Υ(y|t, Φϕ ) =

ϕ j Υ(y|t, Λ j ),

(17)

j=1

where Υ(y|t, Λ j ) is the output distribution obtained for simulation with a parameter distribution according to Λ j .
Equation (17) holds because the single cells are independent and the output distribution is the weighted sum of the
kernel functions. Hence, it can be shown that the super position principle is fulﬁlled [5].

As the data Di , the conditional probability density fy (¯y(i) ), and the output distributions Υ(y|t, Λ j ) are known, the

methods. In this work, the MATLAB toolbox cvx for convex programming [15] has been used in combination with the

5. Application to the TNF signal transduction
In order to illustrate the properties of the proposed scheme, a simple model of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
signaling pathway will be analyzed in the following.
5.1. Model of TNF signaling
In multicellular organisms, the removal of infected, malfunctioning, or no longer needed cells is an important
issue. To achieve this, TNF is able to induce programmed cell death, also called apoptosis, via the activation of the
caspase cascade. On the other hand, it promotes cell survival via the inﬂammatory response, speciﬁcally activation
of the NF-κB pathway [17]. Here, we study a simple model for the caspase and NF-κB activation in response to an
external death receptor stimulus.

The considered model has been introduced in [18] and is based on known activating and inhibitory interactions
among key signaling proteins. Besides active caspase 8 (C8a) and active caspase 3 (C3a), the nuclear transcription
factor κB (NF-κB) and its inhibitor I-κB are considered in the model. A graphical representation of the system is
shown in Figure 2. The model is given by the ODE system

x˙1 = −x1 + (β4 (x3 )α1 (u) + α3 (x2 ))

x˙2 = −x2 + α2 (x1 )β3 (x3 )

x˙4 = −x4 + (β1 (u) + α4 (x3 )).

The state variables xi , i = 1, . . . , 4 denote the relative activities of the signaling proteins C8a, C3a, NF-κB and I-κB,
in this order. The functions α j (xi ) and β j (xi ) represent activating and inhibiting interactions, respectively. They are
given by

(24)

The parameters a j and b j are activation and inhibition thresholds, respectively, and take values between 0 and 1. The
external TNF stimulus is denoted by u. All nominal parameter values are given in Table 1.
As seen from experimental cytotoxicity assays, the cellular response to a TNF stimulus is highly heterogeneous
within a clonal cell population. Some cells die, others survive. However, the reasons for this heterogeneous behavior
are unclear, but of great interest for biological research in TNF signaling. To understand the process at the physiological level it is crucial to consider the cellular heterogeneity, using for example cell population modeling. We model
heterogeneity at the cell level via diﬀerences in the parameter b3 . This parameter has been selected as it models the
inhibitory eﬀect of NF-κB via the C3a inhibitor XIAP onto the C3 activity. As the amount of XIAP shows cell-cell
variability, also variations in the associated inhibition strength in the model used here are likely.

5.2. Results of parameter distribution estimation
For the evaluation of the proposed scheme, we consider an artiﬁcial experimental setup in which the caspase 3
activity is measured at ten diﬀerent time instances during a sustained TNF stimulus, u(t) = 1. At each time instance
the C3a concentration in 25 cells are measured with measurement noise according to Equation (5), where μ1 = 0,
σ1 = 0.05, μ2 = log(0.01), and σ2 = 0.3. The obtained experimental data for a bimodal distribution in b3 are depicted
in Figure 3.
To estimate Φ from this data, the proposed likelihood-based method is applied. The ansatz function are chosen to
be twelve Gaussian distributions with equally spaced center points. The results are shown in Figure 4.
It can be seen from Figure 4 that an accurate estimate of the parameter distribution is obtained, although the
data are noisy and the amount of data is limited. Also the bimodal shape of Φ(b3 ) does not cause any problems.
Additionally, as the optimization problem (21) is concave, we can guarantee that the distribution Φ with the highest
likelihood is reached.
6. Summary and Conclusion
In this paper a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the parameter distributions within cell populations
is presented. The method uses a parameterization of the parameter distribution, convex optimization techniques, and
can deal with realistic noise models. Compared to classical approaches, the method can deal with a small number
of single cell measurements, as it does not rely on the approximation of the measured population response using a
density estimator.
The properties of the proposed scheme are illustrated using artiﬁcial data. It could be shown that the proposed
method yields good estimation results in case of a setup which is realistic in terms of noise and amount of available
data. Also the estimation of bimodal parameter distributions does not cause any problems.
