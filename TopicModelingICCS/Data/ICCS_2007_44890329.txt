Abstract. A vertex of a graph is locally connected if its neighborhood
is connected. A graph G is locally connected if every vertex of G is locally connected. A graph is called claw-free if it does not contain a copy
of K1,3 as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we provide a constructive characterization of 4-connected 4-regular locally connected claw-free
graphs. From its proof, we can give a linear polynomial-time algorithm
to construct a 4-connected 4-regular locally connected claw-free graph.
Keywords: constructive characterization, linear polynomial-time, clawfree graph.

Terminology and Notation

We will consider the class of undirected ﬁnite graphs without loops or multiple
edges, and use [1] for terminology and notation not deﬁned here. Let G = (V, E)
be a graph. For a subgraph H of a graph G and a subset S of V (G), we denote by
G−H and G[S] the induced subgraphs of G by V (G)−V (H) and S, respectively.
A clique of G is a complete subgraph of G. A clique with k vertices is called a
k-clique. We say that a vertex is adjacent to a clique if it is adjacent to at
least one vertex of the clique. A subgraph K and a subgraph B are disjoint
if the vertices of K and the vertices of B are disjoint. For any vertex v, N (v)
¯ (S) =
denotes the neighborhood of v. For S in V , let N (S) = ∪x∈S N (x), and N
N (S) − S = {x ∈ N (S) but x ∈
/ S}. A vertex v of G is locally connected if its
neighborhood N (v) is connected otherwise v is locally disconnected. A graph G
is locally connected if every vertex of G is locally connected. A graph is called
claw-free if it does not contain a copy of K1,3 as an induced subgraph. Whenever

Results

There are a lot of results on algorithms and their complexity analysis (see [2],
[3], [4], [5] ). In this paper, we will provide a constructive characterization of
4-connected, 4-regular, locally connected, claw-free graphs. From its proof, we
can give a linear polynomial-time algorithm to construct a 4-connected 4-regular
locally connected claw-free graph. In order to explore our main results, we ﬁrst
prove the following result.
Lemma 1. Let G be a 4-connected 4-regular claw-free graph on n vertices. If
G contains a 4-clique, then every vertex of G is contained in a 4-clique, and all
4-cliques are disjoint if n ≥ 6.
Proof. Let K be a clique in G. If there is a vertex in G such that it is not
contained in any 4-clique, then there is at least one vertex w in G adjacent to
some clique such that w is not contained in any 4-clique. Without loss of generality assume that K is such a 4-clique adjacent to w. Let V (K) = {v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 }
and wv1 ∈ E(G). Then N (v1 ) = {v2 , v3 , v4 , w}. Let w be a neighbor of w and
w = v1 . If w ∈ {v2 , v3 , v4 } (say w = v2 ), then N (v2 ) = {v1 , v3 , v4 , w }. If
n = 5, then G is K5 and so we are done. So n ≥ 6. It follows that G − {v3 , v4 , w}
is not connected. Thus G is not 4-connected. This contradiction shows that
/ {v2 , v3 , v4 } and (N (w) − {v1 }) ∩ {v2 , v3 , v4 } = ∅. For any two vertices
w ∈
w1 , w2 in N (w) − {v1 }, we have w1 w2 ∈ E(G) since G[w, v1 , w1 , w2 ] = K1,3 and
d(v1 ) = 4. It follows that G[(N (w)∪{w})−{v1 }] is a 4-clique. This contradiction
shows that every vertex of G is contained in a 4-clique. Since G is 4-regular, all
4-cliques are disjoint. So the proof of Lemma 1 is completed.
Lemma 2. Let G be a 4-connected 4-regular claw-free graph on n ≥ 7 vertices and v a vertex of G. If v is locally connected, then G[N (v)] is an induced
hamiltonian path in G[N (v)].
Proof. Let v be a vertex in G and N (v) = {v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 } such that G[N (v)]
is connected. If G contains a 4-clique, then, by Lemma 1, every vertex of G is
contained in a 4-clique K. Assume that v ∈ V (K) and G[(N (v) ∪ {v}) − {v4 }] is
a 4-clique, then v4 is adjacent to at least one vertex of {v1 , v2 , v3 } since G[N (v)]
is connected. Let v4 v1 ∈ E(G). Then N (v1 ) = {v, v2 , v3 , v4 } and G − {v4 , v3 , v2 }
is not connected. Thus G is not 4-connected. This contradiction shows that G
does not contain a 4-clique. It follows that G[N (v) − {vi }] is not a clique for
i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Assume that v1 v2 ∈
/ E(G). Since G[N (v)] is connected, there is a
path P with three or four vertices connecting v1 and v2 in G[N (v)]. Thus we
consider two cases to prove that G[N (v)] is an induced path on 4 vertices with
internal vertices of degree 2 and two end-vertices of degree 1 in G[N (v)].

Case 1. |V (P )| = 3.
Assume that V (P ) = {v1 , v3 , v2 }. Since G[v, v1 , v2 , v4 } = K1,3 , v4 v1 ∈ E(G)
/ E(G) since otheror v4 v2 ∈ E(G) (say v4 v2 ∈ E(G)). Note that v3 v4 ∈
wise G[v, v2 , v3 , v4 ] is a 4-clique. We have that v4 v1 ∈
/ E(G) since otherwise
G[v1 , v4 , v3 , v1 ] = K1,3 , v1 v3 ∈ E(G) or v1 v4 ∈ E(G), where v1 ∈ N (v1 ) −
{v3 , v4 , v}. Let A = {v1 , v2 , w }, where w = v3 if v4 v1 ∈ E(G) and w = v4 if
v3 v1 ∈ E(G). It easy to see that G − A is not connected since n ≥ 7. Thus G
/ E(G). Thus G[N (v)] is just
is not 4-connected. This contradiction shows v4 v1 ∈
an induced hamiltonian path P = v1 v3 v2 v4 with internal vertices of 2 degree
and two end-vertices of degree 1 in G[N (v)].
Case 2. |V (P )| = 4.
/ E(G) since otherwise, say v1 v4 ∈
Assume that P = v1 v3 v4 v2 . Then v1 v4 , v3 v2 ∈
¯ ({v, v4 }) = {v1 , v2 , v3 }, a conE(G), G − {v1 , v2 , v3 } is not connected since N
tradiction. Thus G[N (v)] is just an induced hamiltonian path P = v1 v3 v4 v2
with internal vertices of 2 degree and two end-vertices of degree 1 in G[N (v)].
It follows that the proof of Lemma 2 is completed.

Theorem 3. Every 4-connected 4-regular locally connected claw-free graph G on
at least 7 vertices is isomorphic to a graph of the depiction in Figure 1.
Proof. Assume that G is not isomorphic to a graph of the form in Figure
1, and v is any vertex of G. Then v is locally connected. By Lemma 2, N (v)
is just an induced hamiltonian path in G[N (v)]. We construct the graph starting from v. Let N (v) = {v1 , v2 , u1 , u2 } and G[N (v)] = v2 v1 u1 u2 . Let W1 =
{v1 , v2 } and W2 = {u1 , u2 } and let W be the closed neighborhood of v (i.e.,
W = W1 ∪ W2 ∪ {v}) and H = G[W ]. Note that v2 u1 , v1 u2 , v2 u2 ∈
/ E(G). Then

N (v1 ) ∩ N (u1 ) = {v} since otherwise, let u ∈ N (v1 ) ∩ N (u1 ) − {v}. Then
¯ ({v1 , u1 , v}) = {u, v2 , u2 }. Thus {u, v2 , u2 } is a cut set of G with three verN
tices, a contradiction. Let N (v1 ) = {v2 , v, u1 , v3 }. Then v3 u1 ∈
/ E(G). Adding
v3 to W1 . Since |V (G)| ≥ 7 but |W | = 6, V (G) = W . We have from Lemma 2
that v3 v2 ∈ E(G). We further have the following fact.
/ N (W2 ).
Claim 1. v3 ∈
Recall that v3 u1 ∈
/ E(G). Now we prove v3 u2 ∈
/ E(G). If v3 u2 ∈ E(G), let
N (v2 ) = {v, v1 , v3 , v4 }. Then we have from G[v2 , v4 , v, v3 ] = K1,3 that v4 v3 ∈
E(G). Since G[v3 , v4 , v1 , u2 ] = K1,3 and v1 v4 , v1 u2 ∈
/ E(G), u2 v4 ∈ E(G). If
V (G) = W ∪ {v4 }, then {v4 , u1 } is a cut-set of two vertices since v1 , v2 , v3 , u2 are
of degree 4 in G[W ∪ {v4 }], a contradiction. Thus V (G) = W ∪ {v4 } and add v4
into W1 , it follows that u1 v4 ∈ E(G) since only v1 , u1 , v4 are of degree 3 in G[W ].
So G is isomorphic to a graph of the depiction in Figure 1, a contradiction. Thus
Claim 1 is true.
Note that v2 is of degree 3 and v3 is of degree 2 and v1 is of degree 4 in H.
Consider the vertex v3 of degree 3 in H. By Claim 1, we have V (G) = W . Let
N (v2 ) = {v, v1 , v3 , v4 } and add v4 into W1 . From Lemma 2, vi vi−1 ∈ E(G),
where i = 4. We further have the following fact.
/ N (W2 ).
Claim 2. If V (G) = W , then v4 ∈
If v4 u2 ∈ E(G), let N (v3 ) = {v1 , v2 , v4 , v5 }. Then v5 v4 ∈ E(G) since G[v3 , v5 , v4 ,
/ E(G), v5 u2 ∈ E(G).
v1 } = K1,3 . Since G[v4 , v2 , v4 , u2 ] = K1,3 and v2 v5 , v2 u2 ∈
Thus dH (v4 ) = 4. If V (G) = W ∪ {v5 }, then {v5 , u1 } is a cut set of two vertices, a contradiction. Thus V (G) = W ∪ {v5 }, and add v5 into W1 . Since
dH (v5 ) = dH (u1 ) = 3, u1 v5 ∈ E(G). Thus G is isomorphic to a graph of the
depiction in Figure 1, a contradiction. So v4 u2 ∈
/ E(G). If v4 u1 ∈ E(G), then
G[u1 , u2 , v1 , v4 ] = K1,3 . This contradiction shows that Claim 2 is true.
From the above, we have established the following claim.
Claim 3. vi is of degree 2, vi−1 is of degree 3, and vj is of degree 4 in H
for j = 1, 2, ..., i − 2, where i = 4.
Now we return to the proof of Theorem 3. If V (G) = W , then we have from
dH (u2 ) = 2 that u2 v4 , u2 v3 ∈ E(G). Thus u1 v4 ∈ E(G). It follows that G is
isomorphic to Figure 1. We assume that V (G) = W . Then, by Claim 3, consider
the vertex v3 of degree 3 in H and add the neighbor v5 of v4 outside W into W1 .
By Lemma 2, v5 v4 ∈ E(G). Then v5 has similar properties in Claim 2 and Claim
3 (i = 5). But G is ﬁnite, we must have V (G) = W and W1 = {v1 , v2 , ..., vn−3 }.
And Claim 3 is true for i = n − 3. It follows that G is isomorphic to a graph of
the depiction in Figure 1. Therefore, the proof of Theorem 3 is completed.

Algorithm 4. Construction of a 4-connected 4-regular locally connected clawfree graph G on n ≥ 7 vertices.
1. Pick up any vertex v.
2. Find 4 neighbors of v. Let v2 v1 u1 u2 is a hamiltonian path in N (v) and
W1 = {v1 , v2 } and W = {v, u1 , u2 } ∪ W1 , and set i = 1.
3. Find a neighbor vi+2 of vi . Set W1 = (W1 ∪{vi+2 })−{vi } and W = W ∪{vi }
4. If |W | = |V (G)|, go to Step 5. Otherwise, set i = i + 1 and go to 3.
5. Check whether u2 is adjacent to all vertices of W1 and u1 is only adjacent
to vn−3 .
We now analyze time in Algorithm 4. Note that n is the number of vertices.
Step 1 needs O(1). Step 2 needs O(n). Step 3 needs O(n) and Step 4 needs
O(1). By Theorem 3, such a graph is 4-connected 4-regular locally connected
claw-free. Thus we obtain a linear polynomial time algorithm to construct a
4-connected 4-regular locally connected claw-free graph.
