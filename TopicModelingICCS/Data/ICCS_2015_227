Abstract
Separation ability is one of two most important properties of Liquid State Machines used in
the Liquid Computing theory. To measure the so-called distance of states that Liquid State
Machine can exist in – diﬀerent norms and metrics can be applied. Till now we have used the
Euclidean distance to tell the distance of states representing diﬀerent stimulations of simulated
cortical microcircuits. In this paper we compare our previously used methods and the approach
with Bray-Curtis measure of dissimilarity. Systematic analysis of eﬃciency and its comparison
for a diﬀerent number of simulated synapses present in the model will be discussed to some
extent.
Keywords: Liquid State Machine, Bray-Curtis metric, density of connections

Introduction

Computational Neuroscience has a strong position among all computational problems being
undertaken by the staﬀ of scientiﬁc laboratories throughout the world at the beginning of 21st
century. more and more often understanding the mechanisms controlling the brain is said to
be crucial for further development of medicine, psychology and other brain-oriented areas [?].
It is also possible that the 21st century may be called the century of brain [?, ?, ?].
During the previous ICCS workshops in Cracow [?] and Amstedam [?] we were discussing
some neurodynamical phenomena like self-organising criticality [?] taking place in simulated
fragments of rat brains. So-called separation ability of cortical microcircuits in signal processing
as a function of synapse strength in the selected regions of simulated retina was presented in
Reading in [?] .
In our previous research [?, ?, ?] we used Euclidean – the simplest possible metric to calculate
the so-called distance of states. We have always been interested how application of some other
norms for calculating the distance of states can inﬂuence the separation ability of Liquid State
Machine presented by Maass in 2002 [?].

In this paper we propose using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure instead the Euclidean
norm. We will show that in some cases in can perform better than analysis conducted in the
previous research.

Separation Ability of Liquid State Machine

In Liquid Computing Theory [?] the neural microcircuit behaviour bears metaphorical similarities to the behaviour of surface of the lake which can ’remember’ the history of its previous
stimulation by external conditions like the wind, stones dropped into the water, etc. Similarly
the cortical column called Liquid State Machine (LSM) of a selected animal, especially a primate behaves in the same way. On its dynamics the history of changing in time stimulation is
maintained and can be recognised by external expert called the Readout layer in [?]. One of
the most characteristic properties of the LSM is its separation ability expressed by a measure of
distance of its liquid-states. Microcircuits considered in such a way have computational abilities
[?]
For the previous research [?, ?, ?] we deﬁned the vector of state. We used to divide the
set of action potential events (spikes) into the time intervals of t = 10 ms. So for each time
interval we deﬁned a multi-dimensional vector of state with the coordinates equal 1 when the
spike potential event occurred on a particular neuron in a given interval of time and 0 when
the neuron was inactive. The dimension of the vector was equal to the number of cells in the
simulated hyper-column. Then the Euclidean distance of states was calculated in the traditional
way as a distance of two vectors of state w1 and w2 :
N

(w1i − w2i )2 .

E(w1 , w2 ) =

i=1

The Bray-Curtis distance is recognised as the measure of dissimilarity. The computation
involves summing the absolute diﬀerence between the vectors of state (w1 and w2 ) corresponding
coordinates and dividing it by a sum of all coordinates in both of them. The general formula
is as follows [?, ?]:
N
i=1 |w1i − w2i |
.
(2)
B(w1 , w2 ) = N
i=1 (w1i + w2i )
where in our case N is the vector of state dimension equal to the number of neurons in the
simulated hyper-column.
We have arranged some introductory and hypothetical research with the Bray-Curtis distance applied to LSMs and it was brieﬂy communicated during Cracow Grid Workshop in 2014
by the authors of this paper[?]. However, the aim of research presented in the following sections
was to check how the Bray-Curtis metric performs in comparison to Euclidean distance for the
simulated hyper-column with a diﬀerent number of synaptic connections which reads synaptic
density.

Two diﬀerent varying in time stimulations u and v were necessary so that we could generate
two diﬀerent varying in time ’neural liquids’.
We arranged ten series of such double simulations for hyper-columns interconnected with
probability ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 of the full-connection with step 0.1. Note that in the fullconnection system with self-connections there are more than 16 million synapses (224 ). Such
systems and ensembles of such systems require relatively high computational powers. Because

Results and Conclusions

The time of each spike occurrence was recorded. Then we divided the spikes set into 100 time
intervals t = 10 ms. For each time interval we calculated the vector of state.
The Euclidean distance of states d(u, v) in the largest possible case could be equal to 64 as
a distance of the hyper-column with all neurons active from the hyper-column with all neurons
inactive in a given interval of time.
The nature of Bray-Curtis distance is such that in the above-mentioned case with inactive
and hyper-active hyper-columns the distance of states would be equal to 1.0 – as completely
diﬀerent.
That is why for the following analysis the calculated Euclidean distance of states was normalised by dividing the result by 64.
In Figs 1–3 the distance of states d(u, v) for the chosen connection probability ranging from
p = 0.2 to p = 0.8 is presented. In all cases (from p = 0.1 to p = 1.0) we observe the same
behaviour: the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric performs better than the traditional Euclidean
distance. The Bray-Curtis curves are steeper showing the same tendency towards separation
a bit faster than in the method used so far. It is also worth mentioning that every 400600 ms both calculated distances are merely the same. This may be connected with periodical
synchronisation of most of the neurons in the hyper-column.
This can be a crucial ﬁnding which lets predict that using alternative methods for measuring
the distance of states in LSMs simulating the behaviour of neural cortical microcircuits can show

selected metrics that are better than the others in some selected tasks.

Future remarks

Next we are going to perform more sophisticated analysis of Bray-Curtis measure of dissimilarity
applied to LSMs. Our research will require a deep statistical approach as well as investigating
the applicability of the method for the system with a rapid tendency towards synchronisation
(like in modelling some aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder) [?, ?, ?]. For the systems with a
larger number of neurons and synapses implementation of parallelism will be necessary for the
model. We have experience in large-scalable simulations [?, ?] and we will convert the model
to parallel architecture in the nearest future.
Applying measure of distance adds new insight into neuro-computing theory. We hope that
good understanding of brain computational abilities will make it possible to construct braininspired solutions involving computer security systems and procedures being developed in our
Institute [?].
