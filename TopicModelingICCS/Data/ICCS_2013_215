Abstract
The inversion of magnetotelluric measurements require the computation of the quantity of interest (solution at the receivers)
at diﬀerent positions. Using a multigoal-oriented adaptive strategy for an hp Finite Element algorithm, we ensure accurate
solutions in all receivers. With them, and using a limited memory algorithm for bound constraint optimization (L-BFGS-U
method) to solve the Inverse Problem, we show that we are able to invert properly the simulated measurements in order to
recover the subsurface conductivity distribution. We emphasize that the choice of the unknown of the Inverse Problem aﬀects
signiﬁcantly the convergence of the inversion. We also exhibit the limitations of the electric ﬁeld as the quantity of interest.
When the distribution of the subsurface contains big jumps, the solution of the problem is not unique. The fact that the quantity
of interest is not sensible enough to the variation of the conductivity suggests the use of the impedance as quantity of interest
as a candidate to bring better results in a future research.

1. Introduction
The magnetotelluric (MT) method is a passive electromagnetic (EM) exploration technique intended to estimate the resistivity distribution in the subsurface of the area of interest on scales varying from few meters to hundreds of kilometers. Research applications include experimentation to further develop the MT technique, longperiod deep crustal exploration, and earthquake precursor prediction research [1, 2]. Commercial uses include
hydrocarbon (oil and gas) exploration, geothermal exploration, and mining exploration, as well as hydrocarbon
and groundwater monitoring [2].

The solar wind produces a radiation pressure that causes a compression on the day-side and a tail on the
night-side onto the magnetosphere and due to this interaction, hydromagnetic waves are created. When those
waves reach the ionosphere, they induce an EM ﬁeld that works as power source in magnetotellurics. Depending
upon the type of source we are dealing with, the geomagnetic ﬂuctuations range between frequencies of 10−3 −
105 Hz, which allow us to make measurements with a resolution that ranges from a few meters to hundreds of
kilometers [3].
The origins of MT are attributed to Tikhonov (1950) and Cagniard [4], who established the theoretical basis
of the method. The Tikhonov-Cagniard model idealizes the natural geomagnetic sources as plane waves, and
considers the Earths surface as a plane, with uniformity on the telluric sheets only parallel to the surface. Further
developments in this simple model established what today is known as MT method. For a review, we refer to [5].
It is realistic to treat the EM ﬁelds as plane waves that propagate in the vertical direction towars the Earth’s
surface due to the remote origin of the source [6]. The plane waves originated from the ionosphere travel down
towards the subsurface, and then, scattered waves appearing as a result of subsurface inhomogeneities travel in the
opposite direction. On the other hand, since the scales of MT measurements are in the order of kilometers (see for
instance [7]), it is also realistic to neglect the Earth’s curvature.
To retry the information about the resistivity of the subsurface, an Inverse Problem is deﬁned. The main
contribution of this work is the inversion of magnetotelluric measurements using a hp-self adaptive multigoaloriented Finite Element Method that was proposed in [8], to solve the Forward Direct Problem and the L-BFGS-U
method [9] to solve the Inverse Problem. The need to use a multigoal oriented method comes from the fact
that traditional goal-oriented methods [10, 11] only provide an accurate solution for a unique quantity of interest
(solution at the receiver), while here, we need accurate solutions at several receiver locations.
This work is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the model problem and solution methodology for the
magnetotelluric problem. Section 3 is devoted to the deﬁnition and solution methodology of the Inverse Problem.
In Section 4 the numerical results are shown, and ﬁnally the conclusions are outlined in Section 5.
2. Model Problem
2.1. Strong Formulation
MT measurements are governed by the electromagnetic phenomena, which can be described by Maxwell’s
equations. These equations can be expressed in frequency domain as follows:
∇×E

=

−iωμH

∇×H

=

(σ + iω )E + Jimp

∇ · ( E)

=

ρf

∇ · (μH) =

0,

(1)

where E and H are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. These ﬁelds are driven by an impressed prescribed
electric density current Jimp , ω is the angular frequency, σ stands for the resistivity of the media and ρ f for the
free charge density. The electrical permitivity and the magnetic permeability μ are assumed to be that of the
vacuum ( 0 and μ0 respectively).
When the electrical ﬁelds depends only upon two spatial variables (x, z), then two independent and uncoupled
modes are derived from Maxwells equations: Transverse Electric (TE) and Transverse Magnetic (TM). TE mode
involves (Ey , H x , Hz ) ﬁeld components while TM uses (Hy , E x , Ez ). We focus on the TE mode and we solve the
equation for Ey by a procedure based on a goal-oriented hp-adaptivity Finite Element Method (hp-FEM).
2.2. Truncation of the computational domain
To ensure that the solution of the hp-FEM problem and the actual one do not diﬀer much over R2 , a variety
of Boundary Conditions (BC) can be imposed on the boundary Γ of the computational domain Ω. These include
absorbing BC, Perfectly Matched Layer (PML), or a boundary element technique. However, due to the fact that
the electromagnetic ﬁelds decay exponentially in the presence of lossy media and since we consider a suﬃciently
large computational domain, we impose a zero Dirichlet BC.

2.3. Forward Direct Problem
To decouple the equations, ﬁrst we pre-multiply both sides of Faradays law by μ−1 and we apply the curl
operator. Then, we substitute component by component the result into the double curl operator on the electric
ﬁeld. Due to the decoupling in TE and TM mode, the equation for the y component can be expressed as
−Δu − k2 u = f,

(2)

where u = Ey , k2 = ω2 μ − iμωσ and f = −iωμJyimp .
To obtain the corresponding variational formulation, we pre-multiply equation (2) by a test function v ∈ V(Ω),
where V(Ω) = H01 (Ω) = {u ∈ L2 (Ω) : u|ΓD = 0, ∇u ∈ (L2 (Ω) × L2 (Ω))} is the space of admissible test functions.
Then, integrating by parts and after incorporating the Dirichlet BC over ΓD = ∂Ω, the following abstact variational
formulation (suitable for Finite Element computations) is obtained.

⎨ Find u (σ) such that u ∈ V

⎩ b(v, u∗ ; σ) = F(v) ∀v ∈ V.
Here u∗ is a state scalar-valued solution function. With this solution we compute Li (u∗ (σ)), a linear and continuous
functional [10, 11] in u∗ associated to the i-th receiver deﬁned as:
Li (u∗ (σ)) =

(4)

where ΩRi is the domain where the i-th receiver is located at.
The sesquilinear form b(v, u; σ) (antilinear in v and linear in u) and F(v) (an antilinear form in v) are deﬁned
as:
∇¯v∇u −

F(v) =

2.4. Forward Adjoint Problems
Our objective is to eﬃciently compute linear quantities of interest Li (u), so we need to construct a proper hpdiscretization that makes Li (uhp ) a good approximation of Li (u). In order to determine the elements of the mesh
to be reﬁned, we deﬁne ﬁrst the so-called i-th Adjoint Direct Problem associated to the direct one (6):
⎧

⎪
⎨ Find vhp ∈ Vhp such that

⎪
⎪

2.5. Solution of the MT Problem: Multigoal-Oriented adaptivity for hp-adaptive FEM method
The objective of the traditional goal-oriented method is to construct an optimal hp-grid, in the sense that it
minimizes the problem size needed to achieve a given tolerance error for a given quantity (solution at the receiver)
Li .
i
Let ehp = u − uhp be the discretization error for the Direct Forward Problem and hp
= vi − vihp for the
Direct Adjoint Problem. Then, the error in the quantity of interest may be deﬁned as Li (ehp ) = b(ehp , vi ). By
orthogonality of ehp with respect to vhp (in the b-inner product), we have b(ehp , vhp ) = 0 ∀vhp ∈ Vhp . Therefore,
i
). Now, we we can bound the error by a sum of element contributions. Let bK denote a
b(ehp , vi ) = b(ehp , hp
contribution from the element K to bilinear form b. It then follows that:
|Li (ehp )| = |b(ehp ,

This upper bound that utilizes only local and computable quantities, allows us to design a multigoal-oriented
hp-adaptive reﬁnement strategy. An example of that adaptive strategy can be found in [11]. However, since we
have more than one receiver, we need to properly compute several quantities of interest, so a multigoal-oriented
strategy will be necessary. The strategy we follow is that proposed in [8], where a new linear quantity of interest
at the discrete level is deﬁned as:
M

LuNEW
(whp ) :=
hp
i=1

Li (whp )
,
Li (uhp )

∀whp ∈ Vhp ,

(9)

and the stopping criteria for the adaptivity as:
M

LSu T OP (whp ) :=
i=1

Li (whp )
≤ T OL/100,
Li (uhp )

∀whp ∈ Vhp .

(10)

With this deﬁnitions, we are able to bound all relative errors (in percentage) by a given tolerance TOL as:
max{
i

|Li (uhp ) − Li (u)|
∗ 100} ≤ LSu T OP (ehp ) ∗ 100 ≤ T OL.
|Li (u)|

(11)

In a second step, Equation (9) is corrected:
M

Ri (ehp )

LuNEW
(whp ) :=
hp
i=1

Li (whp )
,
uhp

∀whp ∈ Vhp .

(12)

where Ri (ehp ) is an estimate of the relative error in the i-th quantity of interest. From a practical point of view,
this relative error can be estimated by approximating the exact solution with the solution in a globally reﬁned
h/2, p + 1−grid.
This algorithm works maximizing the error decrease rate. To do so, given a solution uhp , the right-hand-side
of the Adjoint Problem is deﬁned via Equation (12). After that, an existing self-adaptive goal-oriented reﬁnement
strategy (with the newly deﬁned right-hand-side for the dual problem) is applied.
3. Inverse Problem
3.1. Deﬁnition of the Inverse Problem
We deﬁne the following Misﬁt Function:
⎛
1 ⎜⎜⎜⎜
C(σ) = ⎜⎝
2

|g (σ) −
i

⎞
⎟

i 2⎟

(13)

where β > 0 is the so-called regularization parameter and
N
is the vector with the i-th component being equal to the quantity of interest (measured at
• g(σ) = {gi (σ)}i=1
the surface) corresponding to the i-th experiment. It is also called forward operator and it is (in general) a
non linear operator.

• R(σ): It is a real-valued function used for regularization purposes (for example, R(σ) = ||∇σ||L1 (ΩF ) ). In this
work, we select for simplicity R(σ) = 0.
N

is the vector of EM measurements obtained at diﬀerent surface locations and frequencies, and
• d = {dobs
possibly acquired with diﬀerent measurement receivers.

We note that we may replace the l2 -norm by a diﬀerent convex diﬀerentiable real-valued function. A major
advantage of the l2 -norm is that it provides a quadratic functional, and thus, the ﬁrst derivative becomes linear.
We discretize σ as σ(x) = iP σi χi (x), where σi are the coeﬃcients and χi (x) are Heaviside shape functions,
so that σ is expressed as piecewise constant. We assume that the boundary of the Heaviside functions coincide
exactly with the boundary of the actual materials. We do so because we are in a ﬁrst evaluation of the inversion
algorithm and additionally, ﬁnding accurate boundaries among diﬀerent layers can be properly estimates using
other types of measurements, e.g., imaging conditions based on seismic measurements. Then, we call model
parameters (or parameters vector) to the set σ = {σ1 , ..., σP } because if we assume that the remaining variables
( , μ, ω, Jimp ) are known, they completely characterize the system, namely, they parametrize the system.
It may be interesting, depending upon the particular application or due to physical considerations, to use some
change of variables. Here, we deﬁne a general new variable s = s(σ) via a general function h(s) = h(s(σ)) (which
now corresponds to the model parameters ). With the new variable s and the deﬁnition of the Misﬁt Function, our
objective is to ﬁnd the argument s∗ that minimizes
s∗ = arg min C(s),
l≤s≤u

(14)

where the objective function C : Rn → R is nonlinear and with a computable gradient, and vectors l and u
represent lower and upper bounds on the variables.
3.2. Solution of the Inverse Problem: L-BFGS-U method
This method is already implemented in FORTRAN90 and it is especially suitable for problems where the
constraints are set as bounds in the variables, as in our case. It is a quasi-Newton method based on the limitedmemory BFGS approximation updating formula [12, 13] (the name comes from that of the discoverers (Broyden,
Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno)). Since the Hessian matrix of the objective function is not required, this method is
useful in large scale problems in which the Hessian matrix is dense or diﬃcult to compute. This use of the limited
memory BFGS matrices to approximate the Hessian of the objective function is the most important diﬀerence
between that algorithm and those proposed in [14] and [15]. The other diﬀerence comes from the use of line
searches instead of trust regions.
The Active Set Methods consist on making a guess of the active set also called working set W, and then
solve a sequence of linear or quadratic approximations of (13). For the obtained stationary point, one analyzes
whether there exists or not a choice of λi such that the solution for the current W satisﬁes the Karush-KuhnTucker (KKT) conditions. If there exists, the point is accepted as the solution, and otherwise, the entire process
is repeated making a diﬀerent choice of the working set. However, these methods change slowly the working set.
To overcome this problem and allow rapid variations from iteration to iteration in the active set, the method uses
the Gradient Projection method [16, 17, 18, 19, 14], which is especially eﬃcient for bound constrained problems.
The L-BFGS-U method ﬁrst builds a quadratic model of the objective function at each iteration sk .
1
mk (s) = C(sk ) + ∇C T (sk )(s − sk ) + (s − sk )T Bk (s − sk ),
2

(15)

where Bk corresponds to the positive deﬁnite limited BFGS approximation of the Hessian matrix evaluated at sk .
These matrices do not require large amount of memory, so the computational cost is similar to that required in the
limited memory algorithm (L-BFGS, described in [20, 21]) for unconstrained problems.
The search direction is computed by minimizing (15) with respect to the free variables (identiﬁed using the
Gradient Projection method). The obtained approximation solution is denoted by s¯k+1 and the search direction is
deﬁned as δsk = s¯k+1 − sk . Finally, the new iterate sk+1 is computed by a line search along δsk = s¯k+1 − sk . The used
routine to perform this line search is described in [22] and tries to enforce the suﬃcient decrease condition and
the curvature condition by a sequence of polynomial interpolations. This process is repeated until the variation in
the unknown or the variation in the gradient is suﬃciently small. For additional details, we refer to [9].
3.3. Computation of the Jacobian
Given the MT Problem, we solve for the Ey component of the TE mode (3) and then, we deﬁne the quantity
of interest gi of the Missﬁt Function as the solution of Ey at each receiver. Note that in that case gi = Li , the

1569

J. Alvarez-Aramberri et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 1564 – 1573

quantity of interest becomes linear. Once the Missﬁt Function is deﬁned, we solve the corresponding optimization
problem (14) with the L-BFGS-U method. Since the L-BFGS-U code requires the calculation of the Jacobian at
each iteration, we need to compute the derivatives of Li (u∗ (s)). This is done by the adjoint problems deﬁned in (7)
and then, using the following Representation Theorem:
Li (u∗ ) = F(v∗,i ) = b(v∗,i , u∗ ; h(s))

(16)

Notice that we have one adjoint problem for each of the N receivers. Since the sesquilinear form is Hermitian and
we use a direct solver, we select the same hp-discretization for the Direct Forward and Adjoint Poblems. Thereby,
we only need to perform the LU factorization of the stiﬀness matrix once. On the other hand, we redeﬁne the
bilinear form as follows to compute the derivatives of the quantity of interest:
b(v, u; h(s)) = b1 (v, u) + b2 (v, u; h(s)),

(17)

where now
b1 (v, u)

:=

b2 (v, u; h(s))

:= −

Ω

∇¯v∇u,
(18)
Ω

h(s)¯vu.

Here, b, b1 and b2 are sesquilinear forms in the ﬁrst two variables, b2 is linear in the third variable h, and b1 is
independent of h.
Using the deﬁnition of L and F, and their linearity with respect to u and v respectively, we have that:
∂Li (u∗ (s))
∂u∗ (s)
= Li
∂s j
∂s j

and

∂v∗,i (s)
∂F(v∗,i (s))
=F
.
∂s j
∂s j

(19)

Using the ﬁrst equality in (16), we know that:
∂Li (u∗ (s)) ∂F(v∗,i (s))
=
,
∂s j
∂s j

(20)

∂Li (u∗ (s))
∂h(s)
.
= −b2 v∗,i , u∗ ;
∂s j
∂s j

(21)

so we can compute the Jacobian as:

Evaluation of the Jacobian matrix using the above formula requires integration of a function that depends of
the exact solutions of the forward direct and adjoint problems. Assuming that solutions for these two problems
are already available from the simulations of the forward problems, the additional cost of computing the Jacobian
matrix reduces to a simple (Gaussian) integration scheme. This computational cost is negligible compared to the
computational cost required for solving the corresponding forward problems. Since we employ a direct solver of
linear equations and the same discretization for all forward problems, we only need to perform the LU factorization
of the matrix once. Thus, the cost of computing the Jacobian matrix is comparable to that of solving one forward
problem.
4. Numerical Results
Figure 1 describes our model problem. We consider a 60 × 21 km. computational domain composed of three
materials with diﬀerent conductivity. The relative permitivity and permeability are the same in all three materials,
and equal to one. The source (represented with the blue circle) is placed in the center of coordinates and is given
by an impressed volume line current Jimp = y at 0.1 Hz. We consider four ﬁnite-size receivers, represented with
black circles. The distance between receivers is 6 km. and the objective is to measure the Ey component of the
electric ﬁeld at each of them. To invert the magnetotelluric measurements, we have to deﬁne the unknown of the
Inverse Problem. We will consider three diﬀerent and equivalent variables, namely σ, its logarithm, and ρ = 1/σ.
Thus, we are interested in, given an arbitrary initial distribution ρ0 , recover the original one, ρ∗ . To do so, we
solve the Inverse Problem deﬁned in Section 3 and we solve (14) with no regularization term, namely, with β = 0.
The measurements are simulated as follows: Given a distribution of the subsurface ρ∗ = (ρ1 , ρ2 , ρ3 ), we solve

= Li (u∗hp (ρ∗ )).

4.1. Example 1: ρ∗ = (ρ1 = 3, ρ2 = 10, ρ3 = 3)
We ﬁrst consider the following resistivity distribution of the subsurface: ρ∗ = (ρ1 = 3, ρ2 = 10, ρ3 = 3)
Ohm-m. Figure 2 shows the ﬁnal multigoal oriented hp-grid according to this distribution.

Figure 3 (above-left) shows the evolution of the value of resistivity (when the unknown is the conductivity
(s = σ)) and we appreciate how at the end of the iterative process, the solution corresponds to ρ∗ . When the
resistivity is considered as the unknown (s = ρ) we also obtain ρ∗ at the end of the iterative process (see Figure 3
(above-right)) and the same happens when we consider the logarithm of the conductivity (s = ln(σ)) as the
unknown (see Figure 3 (below-left)). The initial point of the optimization algorithm corresponds to ρ0 = (6, 6, 6).
We also compare the evolution of the Relative Error for the three variables when the same initial distribution as
before is considered. We appreciate in Figure 3 (below-right) that using the conductivity as the variable of the
Inverse Problem, we obtain a faster convergence.
4.2. Example 2: ρ∗ = (ρ1 = 3, ρ2 = 100, ρ3 = 3)
The distribution of the subsurface is now ρ∗ = (ρ1 = 3, ρ2 = 100, ρ3 = 3) Ohm-m. We compute a new
multigoal oriented hp-grid according to this distribution and we solve the Inverse Problem for the same three

Figure 4 (above-left) shows the evolution of the value of resistivity (when the unknown is the conductivity
(s = σ)) and we appreciate how at the end of the iterative process, the solution corresponds to ρ∗ . However, when
the resistivity (Figure 4, above-right) and logarithm of the conductivity (Figure 4, below-left) are considered as
the unknown, we do not obtain ρ∗ at the end of the iterative process. This is because the solution is not unique
and the measurements we have are not sensible enough to the variation of the conductivity. This is expected to be
ﬁxed by using the impedance as quantity of interest.
The decrease in the Relative Error for the three variables when the same initial distribution as before is considered is showed in Figure 4 (below-right).

5. Conclusions and Future Work
The multigoal-oriented adaptive algorithm provides accurate solutions in all receivers. With them, we have
shown that the we are able to invert the magnetotelluric measurements and we have proved the usefulness of
the multigoal-oriented hp-adaptive FEM. Besides, we appreciate that the choice of the unknown for the inverse
problem aﬀects to the convergence of the method.
On the other hand, with more complicated distributions of the subsurface resistivity, the electric ﬁeld shows
his limitations as the choice of the quantity of interest. In future research eﬀorts, we will choose the impedance
as quantity of interest. Additionally, problems with more complicated geometries will also be investigated before
starting with 3D problems.
