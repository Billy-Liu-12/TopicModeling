Abstract. We performed a 2-dimensional free energy calculation in the
conformational space composed of two structures, best RMSD (Root
Mean Square Distance) and the worst RMSD structures using ZDOCK
on the Colicin E7 (protein) and Im7 (Inhibitor) complex. The lowest
free energy minimum structure is compared to the X-ray crystal structure and the best RMSD docking structure. The free energy correction
for the best RMSD structure shows an alternative in the prediction of a
ﬂexible loop position, which could not describe rigid body docking.
Keywords: Free energy calculation, docking, Colicin E7-Im7 complex.

Introduction

Docking is a method for estimating the near native structure for a protein-protein
complex or a protein-ligand complex through shape or chemical (hydrophobic,
hydrophilic) complementarity [1,2]. For example, the near native structure for
a protein-protein complex can be easily found if a complementary shape exists between the interface of two proteins. For an eﬃcient search for the near
native docked structure from a set of mostly ”incorrectly” docked structures,
the docking method performs a rough prediction by treating the two proteins as
rigid bodies. Through appropriate rotation and translation of the two rigid bodies using fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) [3], a score is assigned using a scoring
function that depends on how close two proteins ﬁt at the complementary interface. At this stage of rough prediction, the shape information about two entities
plays a dominant role. As well as shape information, a docking method may also
make use of complementary information provided by electrostatics or hydrophobic interactions at the interface of the protein-protein complex. The information
about the chemical complementarity between two protein complexes leads to an
energetic correction to the shape complementary based on the FFT technique,

which is adapted by FTDOCK [4]. For a more elaborate correction of the implicit
solvent model, a desolvation energy correction using the ACE (Atomic Contact
Energy) [5] is added to the FFT technique and the electrostatic correction in
ZDOCK [6]. In addition to electrostatics, the geometry-based hydrophobic complementarity at the interface of protein-protein complex has been incorporated
into the FFT-based algorithm in MolFit [7]. Recently, more advanced algorithms
have been developed to improve the rigid body docking based on FFT through
the incorporation of a pairwise structure-based potential in PIPER [8]. At the
reﬁnement stage of prediction, more elaborate algorithms such as FlexE [9] are
adapted into the docking methods to describe ﬂexible side chains or backbone
movements through the superimposed structures of the ensemble. Dock 4.0 [10]
has been implemented with an incremental construction and random search algorithm. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation in an explicit solvent model has
been applied to myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT) and its binding
site in protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) [11] with a 2-5 ns simulation and FK506
(ligand)-FKBP (FK binding protein) with a 1 ns simulation [12]. However, despite these several algorithms, the incorporation of information about ﬂexible
side chain and backbone movements remains one of the main challenges facing
the modern docking method. In this study, we propose a free energy correction to the rigid body docking method. The free energy method through eﬀective conformational sampling using the WHAM (Weighted Histogram Analysis
Method) procedure [13,14,15,16,17] is able to predict the lowest free energy minimum structure of a protein-protein complex. One of the advantage of the free
energy technique in the prediction of near native structure for a protein-protein
complex is that it incorporates the dynamics of the protein-protein complex. It
can provide us with information of ﬂexible loop movements, depending on the
timescale of the MD simulation. In addition, it also provides us with entropy
information as well as the energetics of the protein-protein complexes. Such entropy information can prevent the overestimation of the energetics involving the
residues at the interface of the protein-protein complex. Entropy is a signiﬁcant
factor which strongly inﬂuences the formation of a complex. The general free
energy method for predicting protein-protein complex requires a huge amount
of sampling in conformational space, especially if starting as a blind trial of
the conformational sampling. Such a sampling task becomes aggravated as the
protein size increases, and such requires expensive computational expenditure.
However, use of rigid body docking, a global search for a “nearly correctly docked
structure” from “the set of incorrectly docked structures”, could dramatically
decrease the burden of conformational sampling for the free energy calculation.
In this case, the conformational sampling for the free energy calculation is focused on the region of near native structures for the protein-protein complex
identiﬁed by rigid body docking. Here, we suggest an eﬃcient method for prediction of protein-protein complexes by combining the free energy method with the
docking method.

Methods

2.1

Rigid Body Docking

The free energy method combined with the docking method is applied to a trial
protein-inhibitor system : DNAase domain of Colicin E7 (Protein)−Im7 (Inhibitor) for which we have experimental information. Colicins are protein toxins
produced by Escherichia coli [18]. The cytotoxic activity is known to be suppressed by binding with its inhibitor [19]. One of the interesting features of colicin
and its inhibitors is that the binding aﬃnity is among the strongest known in
protein-inhibitor interactions [20]. A test case for the free energy docking technique was selected from the decoy set of the published “Protein-Protein Docking
Benchmark” [21]. The benchmark includes individually crystallized receptor and
ligand PDBs, along with the co-crystallized complex PDBs for testing protein
docking algorithms. The endonuclease domain of Colicin E7 in complex with its
inhibitor Im7 protein was used as the test case due to the relatively small size of
the protein-protein complex. Two structures were chosen for the references for
the free energy calculations based on their RMSDs with respect to the crystallized structure (PDB code : 7CEI). The deviations of Cα RMSD values of the
docked structures (compared to X-ray crystal structure) generated by ZDOCK
is in the range of from 2.12 ˚
A (Best RMSD) to 36.64 ˚
A (Worst RMSD)1 . The
conformations of the two structures, best RMSD and the worst RMSD, is shown
in Fig. 1. The other intermediate structures lie between the two extremes that
we have chosen.
2.2

Order Parameter and Free Energy Surface

We choose the Q value, the similarity index between two conformations, as an
order parameter for the free energy calculation. Q has been widely used in the
free energy calculations in protein folding studies [22,23]. It is deﬁned as
QA =

1
N

exp −
ij

A 2
)
(rij − rij
2
2σ

(1)

where rij is the distances between i-th and j-th atom in conformation of interA
est, rij
is the same for the conformation A for which the QA value is deﬁned,
and normalization factor N is equal to number of pairs of atoms whose positions
deﬁne the conformation. The similarity index QA changes from 1 (for the conformation A) to 0 (for a conformation with no resemblance to A). Normally, only
Cα carbons are chosen in the calculation of the Q value. To track the ﬂexible
protein movements, however, we extend the range of atoms to include Cβ , Cγ ,
Cδ , Cε and CZ atoms [24]. In Eq. 1, σ controls the resolution of the Q value.
Considering that the resolution of the X-ray crystal of 7CEI is 2.3 ˚
A [19], σ is
set to 2 ˚
A in our study. A total of 878 atoms are considered in the calculation

of QA value; this deﬁnition is essential in tracking the conformational change
which involve small movements or rotations of ﬂexible side chains. We choose
two references, the best docked structure and the worst docked structure as
shown in Fig. 1. The basic idea is to perform all the conformational sampling
using WHAM between these two extreme references.
2.3

MD Simulation

We performed free energy calculations in the 2-dimensional conformation space
composed of (QbestRMSD , QworstRMSD ). The conformational sampling is guided
by a biasing potential,
V (Qbest , Qworst ) =

min
where kbest and kworst are spring constants and Qmin
best and Qworst are the locations at which the biasing potentials are applied. The spring constants kbest and
kworst are in the range of from 11.5 kcal/mol/˚
A2 to 82.5 kcal/mol/˚
A2. These
spring constants are determined so as to obtain the best overlap between trajectories for good sampling. For dielectric constant =80.0, a total of 367 windows
min
are used for each diﬀerent Qmin
worst and Qbest ranging from 0.5 to 1. Each window
was run for 50 ps. For productive data, the ﬁrst 10 ps simulation is removed.
Thus, the total sampling corresponds to 14.7 ns (40 ps × 367 windows). On the
other hand, for dielectric constant =4.0, a total of 388 windows are used for
min
each diﬀerent Qmin
worst and Qbest ranging from 0.5 to 1. Each window was run
for 100 ps. For productive data, the ﬁrst 10 ps simulation is removed. Thus, the

Free Energy Correction to Rigid Body Docking

225

total sampling corresponds to 32.8 ns (90 ps × 364 windows). All of the MD
simulations were performed using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic and Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) at the atomistic level with the CHARMM27
protein-lipid force ﬁeld [25]. The best RMSD structure and the worst RMSD
structures were treated with a dielectric constant of 80.0 and 4.0 using the
distance dependent dielectric solvent model, (r)= r. The two references, the
best RMSD and the worst RMSD structures, were minimized using the steepest
descent gradient method in NAMD employing the CHARMM force ﬁeld. The
charm2lammps perl script [25] converted each minimized structures into the
initial structures for LAMMPS. These were equilibrated for 1 ns at 293K. In the
process of equilibration at 293 K, target Molecular Dynamics was performed for
the two structures to keep the two structures less than 0.1 ˚
A of the backbone
RMSD with respect to the two references. The Coulombic and Lennard-Jones
interactions were calculated with a 10.0/12.0 ˚
A twin-range cutoﬀ. This is a feasibility study; the validity of the method is to be established (below). The various
computational compromises can be removed in future work.

Result

Figure 2 shows that the 2-dimensional free energy surface (FES). (Qbest,Qworst :1.0,
0.59) and (Qbest ,Qworst :0.59, 1.0) corresponds to the best RMSD and the worst
RMSD structures respectively. It is gratifying that the lowest free energy structure at =4.0 is quite similar to the X-ray crystal structure with Cα RMSD of
2.05 ˚
A. Figure 3.a shows the superimposed images of best RMSD (Cyan) and the
lowest free energy minimum structure (Orange). Figure 3.b shows the superimposed images of the the lowest free energy minimum structure (Orange) and the
X-ray crystal (Green). The main diﬀerence at the backbone level between the
lowest free energy structure and X-ray structure lies in loop conﬁgurations from

Discussion

We performed free energy calculation in the 2-dimensional conformation space
composed of the two references, best and the worst RMSD structures. The docking method and the free energy sampling method are quite complementary to
each other. The docking method (based on the rigid body docking) dramatically
narrows the sampling space. Otherwise, the blind test would require exhaustive
computational performance. If the X-ray crystal structure of the protein-protein
complexes is identiﬁed (7CEI in our study), we can test the validity of the docking method. By calculating the RMSD value with respect to the X-ray crystal
structure, we can choose two references of the best and worst RMSD docking
structures. Also, if we also have biological information (such as catalytic site or
active site), physical (main groove or minor grove) and chemical information (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, H-bonds) about the protein-protein complex, the docking
method remains an essential tool to predict the “nearly correct” conﬁguration of

the protein-protein complexes within the rigid body approximation. However, if
the X-ray crystal form of the protein-protein complex is not available, or when
the suﬃcient information about the chemical and physical composition of each
entity in protein-protein complexes is missing, the rigid docking method would
be less reliable. Furthermore, when ﬂexible loops play critical roles in forming
protein-protein complexes, the error in the rigid body prediction will increase.
In this case, however, the docking method provide several “plausible” candidates
for the protein-protein complex at the rough prediction level. The free energy
method then performs the key mission of ﬁnding the “nearly correct structure”
from the “plausible” structures, including information of ﬂexible loops. As a future study, we will apply our method with explicit water to the present case and
ﬁnally to the case for which an X-ray crystal of the complex has not been solved.
