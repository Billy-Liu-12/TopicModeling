Abstract. Electronic devices have been useful to evaluate muscle fatigue and
activation, co-ordination and metabolic consuption among different sports
activities. Since these important variables have not been investigated during
fitness training, the present study aims to analyze the activity of the major
muscles of the lower extremity during training activities on a cardiofitness
apparatus (Cardio WaveTM, Technogym® - Gambettole, Italy). This device is
able to stimulate the multiplanar movements of lower limbs by combining
various types of movement according to the physical principles of human
motion. Working simultaneously on three axes by a sliding movement of lower
limbs should activate different muscle groups following four positions at
different intensity level. Muscles activity and training effectiveness were
evaluated by monitoring Electromiography signal, metabolic data, oxygen
uptake and heart rate. The goal of this research is to develop a system able to
manage different information coming by varius electronic devices.
Keywords: EMG, Cardiofitness, Wavelet.

1 Introduction
More and more people are deciding to start exercising in a fitness center in order to
increase muscle strength and reduce body fat. Several models of cardiofitness
machines are available to practitioners who freely choose the exercise modality.
However, incorrect exercise intensities and positions are related to inefficacious
training and incidence of injuries 1..
Cardio WaveTM (CW) is a cardiofitness apparatus specifically designed to allow
movements along three axes (Fig. 1) by combining different movements which
extensively train lower limb muscles according to four positions:
• Basic (B): with chest erect.
• Intermediate (I): with chest leant forward.
• Advanced (A): with chest and hands leant forward the ground.
• Free style (F): with arms free to oscillate.
Each position is meant to train different muscle groups.

During whatever sport activity fatigue is indicated by a decrease of muscle strength
and power. Most studies of neuromuscular activity and fatigue have evaluated
isometric and cyclical contractions. However, these types of contractions may not be
representative of muscle activity and fatigue during physical exercise 2.. Indeed,
available data suggest that the development of fatigue is specific to contraction type,
intensity and duration of activity 3.. An exercise of the type that occurs during a
fitness training session is characterized by a variety of muscle activities.
In order to investigate lower limb muscle activity and training optimization at the
four positions (i.e. B, I, A, F) and in the 3 intensity levels, several parameters were
monitored. Particularly Electromyography (EMG), Hearth Rate (HR), Oxygen
uptake (VO2) and Lactate threshold (LA) were recorded by means of four different
devices.
EMG was used to display muscle activation patterns and interpret both dysfunction
and functional muscle recruitment 4.. HR is an important parameter to evaluate a
specific exercise task in terms of the strain it places on the individual’s aerobic system
5.. Both LA threshold and VO2 are predictors of aerobic exercise capacity 6..
Aim of this research was to evaluate training activities using the information
coming from different electronic devices.

2 Methods
2.1 Subjects
During a test session nine healthy subjects - 5 trained and 4 untrained - with no
history of musculoskeletal injuries and free from cardiac or metabolic disorders were
recruited. They agreed to participate in the study. All subjects were selected on a
voluntary basis from a fitness center population. They represented a wide spectrum of
body weight, height, age and muscle strength. They ranged in age between 25 and 33
years with a mean value of 27.4 years. Their weight ranged from 65.4 kg to 99.8 kg
with a mean value of 75.9 kg. Their height ranged from 167 cm to 177.8 cm with a
mean value of 171.5 cm.
We considered as trained group the subjects that claimed to train at least twice a
week at a moderate intensity (60-70% HRmax), for a minimum duration of 45 minutes
/ session.
Before training sessions all groups performed a 20-minute stretching protocol for
lower limbs 7. for 30 seconds. This exercise was repeated 3 times for each muscle

group. After a 10-minute warming-up on the ergometer, subjects were asked to
perform randomly in all the four positions allowed by CW.
2.2 Data Recording
Commercial electronic devices are used to monitor different physics parameters for
subject recruited and for each training session (Table 1).
Vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were
selected for EMG analysis, as they are the most stimulated muscles in this kind of
exercise.
The subjects were prepared for placement of EMG electrodes: the skin of each
electrode site was shaved and cleaned carefully with alcohol in order to have a low
inter-electrode resistance. The activity of each muscle was recorded by means of a
couple of electrodes (Ag-Ag/Cl; Aurion s.r.l., Milan, Italy; 20 mm diameter, 20 mm
inter-electrode distance). The electrodes were placed longitudinally on the motor
point areas of the muscle examined. EMG signals were recorded telemetrically and
the electrodes were placed on the RF, mid-way between the anterior superior iliac
spine and the superior border of the patella; the BF over the long head, half-way
between the ischial tuberosity and lateral femoral epicondyle; the VM at 80% on the
line between the anterior spina iliaca and the joint space in front of the anterior border
of the medial ligament 8..
To reduce movement artefacts, the electrodes were taped to the skin with an elastic
bandage. Moreover, the usage of a wireless device allowed not to interfere with the
subject’s movements. EMG activity was acquired by using a wireless low power
signal conditioning electronics device (ZeroWire Aurion s.r.l., Milan, Italy), in order
to achieve both a stable input impedance and a high value of signal amplification (up
to 100,000 V/V); a 2 KHz sample frequency was used for analog- to -digital
conversion.
VO2, HR and La concentrations were measured at rest and during exercise and
recovery 9, 10..
During the test session, VO2 was monitored continuously using a smaller portable
gas analyzer (FitmateProTM, Cosmed, Rome, Italy), in order to assess cardio
respiratory function. This device allowed the direct measurement of VO2 max during an
up to maximal exertion incremental exercise protocol, the extrapolation of VO2 max
during a sub-maximal incremental exercise, and the Estimation of VO2 max based on
the results achieved during some standard field tests.
Heart Rate was monitored by telemetric heart-rate bands (Polar, Kempele, Finland)
with the registration of values during each minute of exercise on CW. We considered
the last minute for statistical purposes 11-13.. The 4.0 mmol/l La threshold was
measured with a lactate-meter (Accu-check, Roche Diagnostic, France) at rest and
during exercise (at the end of each 3-minutes step) and recovery (3, 6, 9 minutes after
performing the test).
All recording data coming from different devices were independently collected ,
were stored in a common database and processed togheter with a custom-written
software in order to obtain information useful to a training activity analysis. Data
coming from different devices use a storage memory of about 300 MegaByte for any
subject. The computational time necessary to complete one test session is about 2
hours for any participant.

2.3 Fatiguing Protocol
We used a fitness-specific intermittent exercise protocol, which provided a fatiguing
activity. Each subject performed 4 test sessions, one for each CW position (i.e., B, I,
A, F). During a test session, subjects randomly performed the same 12-minute
exercise at different intensities (4-minute step at three different intensities: low - 120
RPM, middle - 200 RPM and high intensity -300 RPM) imposed by the CW machine
in the same position. In each session, subjects warmed up by 4 min/step at the three
intensities selected; each session was separated by 180 min of recovery, but the
subjects could only make 2 sessions per day in order to aid muscle fatigue recovery.
2.4 Data Processing
In order to test the different parameters for the purpose of evaluating muscle activity
and fatigue, EMG data were analyzed by using LabView 8.0 software (National
Instruments corp., Austin, TX, USA).

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) was used in order to identify particular
time-frequency signal models. Wavelet analysis is becoming a common tool for
studying the localized variations of power within a time series. By decomposing a
time series into time–frequency space, it is possible to evaluate both the dominant
modes of variability and how those modes vary in time 14, 15..
In particular, in order to analyze EMG signals, Mean Instantaneous Frequency
(MIF) was calculated. Starting from the spectrographic analysis of the signal, we
aimed at pointing out how the signal’s central frequency changes in time. MIF
represents the power of spectral response for each subject studied. MIF is a mean
value calculated to get a group parameter aimed at estimating how much the strength
of muscle contraction and the degree of muscle fatigue vary in time 15.. MIF
represents power spectral response for each subject trial: from MIF vector a mean
value is calculated in order to obtain a clustering parameter.

As for HR, LA and VO2 measures, once the data coming from the test were stored,
the data themselves were processed by means of statistical tools. The processing was
made in order to evaluate the change of each parameter according to the different
positions and intensity levels.
In particular, for the EMG data, for each muscle a 4 (Positions) x 3 (intensity level)
x 2 (Groups) ANOVA for repeated measures was applied to verify statistical
differences in EMG data expressed as percentages of basal values. After data
processing it is useful to analyse correlation between data coming from different
devices.

3 Results
The data resulting from each test use a lot of storage memory and present a variety of
typologies since they are the results of a processing of various signals. As a
consequence, computational time to get the information about the quality of a training
session is long.
MIF for each single muscle in the three intensity levels in both groups was
computed in order to evaluate contraction power variation for each of them, thus
underlining fatigue level. In tables 2 and 3 mean values of MIF in the four positions
investigated for the different intensities are shown. From EMG’s statistical analysis,
no difference emerged between groups.

About HR and VO2 we observed a statistically significant difference only during
the position F at the middle intensity among trained and untrained subjects, but the
post hoc analysis did not show any significant difference (figure 4 and 5).
We did not find any significant difference for the blood lactate values in both
groups.

3 Discussion
On the basis of the results obtained, indications useful for the optimization of the
training sessions were found. For instance, we observed an increase of the exercise
intensity and muscular activation during the training session in F position. In UT
group there was a trend towards a higher value of MIF, probably due to the lower
economy of this intense exercise. However, the lack of statistical significance
between T and UT may be attributed to the lower number of subjects.
As above mentioned, the insufficient statistical relevance of the data can also
depend on the inefficiency of the whole measuring and processing procedures. These
difficulties lengthen measuring and processing times a lot, thus making the
monitoring of a high number of subjects difficult.
This problem might be solved by using a structure based on computer grids. In
fact, nowadays this technology is very used for similar applications in different
research fields 16, 17. (figure 7). Generally speaking, grid computing is the
application of several computers to a single problem at the same time. It is usually
about scientific or technical problems that require a great number of computer
processing cycles or access to large amounts of data.
Ideally, a grid should provide full-scale integration of heterogeneus computing
resources of any type: processing units, storage units, communication units, and so on
18.. For this problem a data grid can be used. It has the data storage capacity as its
main shared resource. Such a grid can be regarded as a massive data storage system
built up from portions of a large number of storage devices. Particularly, a remote
user (e.g. a researcher) can manage data coming from different fitness centres and
process them by using the grid resources at the same time, which would allow to
manage also a much bigger database. Grid could be seen as a way to store data and to

make them available to multiple users. The computing resources must satisfy basic
requirements 18.: They must have enough computing power and data storage capacity
to properly run the grid platform; they do not need to be directly connected to each
other but they must know some entity that takes it to the grid; they can be indirectly
connected through routers, gateways, hubs, switches, bridges, and wireless
connections, by which a data packet can be sent from one computing resource to
another.
For a data grid, the overall data storage capacity of a grid is the sum of the storage
capacity made available for the grid in all its nodes and the performance of a data grid
heavily depends on its communication links.

4 Conclusion
The paper presented a integrated system to manage and analyze different data in order
to evaluate the training in cardiofitness activity. EMG, LA, HR and VO2 were
monitored during a training session and stored in a local database. The data were
processed and a statistical analysis was performed in order to give usefully
information to optimize the training session. Moreover a database containing all the
monitored parameters for the different subjects was made. Future work will deal with
the application of this system on the grid in order to improve its efficiency, reducing
computational times and making the monitoring of a high number of subjects easy.
