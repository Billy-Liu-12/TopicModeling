Abstract. In a recent series of tutorial papers, Rust [7,8,9,10] modelled measured time series for global temperatures and fossil fuel CO2
emissions with related combinations of polynomials, exponentials, and
sinusoids, using least squares ﬁts that can be done by students well grounded in practical statistics. The analysis suggested that temperatures
cycle around a monotonically increasing, accelerating baseline with a period of ≈ 65 years and that the exponential growth rate of CO2 emissions
varies inversely with this cycle. The Gaia hypothesis [5] suggests that the
biosphere adjusts atmospheric greenhouse gases to maintain an optimal
temperature for life. The previous analysis is here extended with a series of ﬁtting exercises designed to demonstrate that the above described
inverse relation represents a Gaian feedback.

Introduction

Figure 1 gives a plot of annual global total fossil fuel CO2 emissions, measured
in millions of metric tons of carbon [MtC], for the years 1856-1999. These data,
which were compiled by Marland, et. al. [6], can be found at http://cdiac.ornl.gov
/trends/emis/em cont.htm. The dashed curve is a nonlinear ﬁt [9] of the model
P (t − t0 ) = P0 eα(t−t0 ) ,

(1)

where P (t) is the total emission in year t, t0 = 1856.0, and P0 and α are free parameters. The observations undulate systematically around the ﬁt, and a Fourier
analysis of the residuals indicated a cycle with period ≈ 65 years. The amplitude
of the cycle appeared to increase in time with the same exponential rate as the
ﬁtted curve. This suggested a model of the form
P (t − t0 ) =

P0 + P1 sin

2π
(t − t0 + θ)
τ

eα(t−t0 ) ,

(2)

with free parameters P0 , P1 , α, τ, θ. Fitting this model [10] gave estimates
Pˆ0 = 133.8 ± 5.0 [M tC] , Pˆ1 = 25.4 ± 1.6 [M tC] ,
(3)
τˆ = 64.9 ± 1.5 [yr] , θˆ = 26.6 ± 2.7 [yr] , α
ˆ = 0.02814 ± .00034 [yr−1 ] .
The ﬁt, plotted as a solid curve, explains 99.73% of the variance in the data.

Fig. 1. Annual global total fossil fuel CO2 emissions are plotted as discrete circles. The
dashed curve is the ﬁt of the model (1), and the solid curve is the ﬁt of (2).

Figure 2 is a plot of annual global average tropospheric temperature anomalies (in ◦ C) for the years 1856-2001. The anomalies were obtained from the
measured temperatures by subtracting the average temperature for 1961-1990.
These data, which were calculated by P. D. Jones, et. al. [2], can be obtained
online at http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/cru.htm. Low order polynomials ﬁts [7,
8] suggested an accelerating warming with a monotonically increasing baseline.
If T (t) is the anomaly in year t, then warming with constant acceleration can be
modelled by
T (t − t0 ) = T0 + C2 (t − t0 )2 ,
(4)
with free parameters T0 and C2 . Including a linear term did not signiﬁcantly
reduce the sum of squared residuals [8]. A slightly better ﬁt was obtained [9] for
T (t − t0 ) = T0 + C2 exp[0.01407(t − t0 )] ,

ˆ in (3). The residuals for both
where the rate 0.01407 [yr−1 ] is one half of the α
ﬁts oscillated with period τ ≈ 63 years [8,9,11] which is close to the τˆ in (3).
Also, the oscillation was a half cycle out of phase with the emissions cycle, with
maximum emissions corresponding to minimum temperatures, and vice versa.
This temperature cycle was previously noted by Schlesinger and Ramankutty
[14], and the inverse correlation between variations in temperature and emissions
was previously noted by Rust and Kirk [13]. Their work was extended by Rust
and Crosby [12] who argued that the correlation arises from a Gaian feedback
by which increasing temperatures reduce the growth in fossil fuel production.

Fig. 2. The circles are observed annual global average temperature anomalies. The
solid curve is the ﬁt of the quadratic/sinusoidal model (6), the ﬁnely dashed curve is
the ﬁt of the exponential/sinusoidal model (7), and the coarsely dashed curve is the ﬁt
of the atmospheric-CO2 -driven/sinusoidal model (10).

Adding the temperature cycle to the models (4) and (5) gives

and
T (t − t0 ) = T0 + C2 exp [0.01407(t − t0 )] + A1 sin

with free parameters T0 , C2 , and A1 . The period of the sinusoid is exactly the
τˆ in (3), and the phase constant has been set to θˆ − (ˆ
τ /2) = −5.85 to make the
oscillation exactly one half cycle ahead (or behind) the one for the emissions.
Fitting these two models [10] gave the parameter estimates in columns 2 and 3
of Table 1 and the solid and ﬁnely dashed curves in Fig. 2.

Exercises 1 and 2: Precedence and Causality

A 64.9 year cycle in both the temperatures and the emissions cannot be a coincidence. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, so its accumulation in the atmosphere is expected to cause some warming. But is the cycle an emissions eﬀect vectored into
the temperatures, or is it a Gaian feedback by which increasing temperatures

supress fossil fuel consumption? One indication of causality would be a deﬁnite
time delay between the cycles in the two records. If the phase constants -5.85
in (6) and (7) are replaced by free parameters φq and φe , then two 4-parameter
linear least squares ﬁts give estimates φˆq = −4.75 ± 1.17 and φˆe = −4.80 ± 1.18.
These estimates indicate a nominal lag of approximately one year between a
temperature extremum and the opposite extremum in the emissions. But -5.85
falls inside the ±1σ uncertainty intervals for both estimates, so that lag is not
statistically signiﬁcant. Also, for both ﬁts, an F-test indicates that the additional
free parameter does not produce a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the sum
of squared residuals. Thus the data cannot reliably determine precedence for the
two cycles.

Exercise 3: Atmospheric Accumulation of CO2

High quality measurements of global atmospheric CO2 concentrations, made by
C. D. Keeling, et. al. [4], can be found at http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/maunaloaco2/maunaloa.co2. Yearly averages for 1959-2001 are plotted in Fig. 3. It is
generally accepted that ≈ 50% of the fossil fuel CO2 emissions remains in the
atmosphere, so a model for atmospheric accumulation c(t) can be written
t−t0

c(t − t0 ) = c0 + γ

where c0 is the concentration at epoch 1856.0, P (t ) is the emissions total in year

data. The integral could be evaluated in closed form, but it is easier to compute
it with a numerical integrator. The only complication is that the units of the
atmospheric measurements are [ppmv], but the units of Pˆ0 and Pˆ1 are [MtC].
The conversion factor [15] is 1 [ppmv] = 2.130 × 103 [MtC]. The strategy used
here was to convert the measurements to [MtC] to obtain the estimates cˆ0 =
(6.2899 ± .0058) × 105 [MtC] and γˆ = 0.572 ± .032. The ﬁt, which explained
99.87% of the variance, was converted back to [ppmv] units to be plotted as the
smooth curve in Fig. 3. Clearly the 64.9 year cycle was totally smoothed out by
the cumulative quadrature, so its appearance in the temperature record cannot
be due to its presence in the emissions record.

Fig. 3. The circles are the yearly average atmospheric CO2 concentrations in units of
part per million by volume [ppmv] for the years 1959-2001. The curve was obtained by
ﬁtting (9) to the data and extending the ﬁt back to 1856.0.

Exercise 4: The Atmospheric Temperature Connection

Conventional wisdom holds that the response of global temperatures to increasing atmospheric CO2 can only be estimated within the context of sophisticated
climate models. But reconstructions [1,3] from Antarctican ice cores of atmospheric temperature changes and atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the past
160,000 years have shown that the two quantities have varied proportionately,
and in lock step, through a temperature range of length 12.5◦ C and a concentration range of length 100 ppmv. This suggests a model of the form

where c(t − t0 ) is the function plotted as a smooth curve in Fig. 3, and T0 ,
C2 , and A1 are free parameters, with T0 here being not T (t0 ) but rather the
temperature anomaly for an atmosphere with no CO2 . This model assumes that
the 64.9 year cycle truly is a weather/climate eﬀect that is superposed on the
CO2 -driven baseline. Fitting it to the temperature anomalies is another easy
linear least squares problem, given the software written for the previous exercise.
The parameter estimates are given in the last column of Table 1, and the ﬁt is
plotted as the coarsely dashed curve in Fig. 2.

Exercises 5-7: The Gaian Feedback

Since the 64.9 year temperature cycle is not caused by the CO2 emissions, the
inverse cycle in the emissions must be caused by a negative, temperature dependent feedback. Rust and Kirk [13] modelled this feedback with the diﬀerential
equation
dP

P (t0 ) = P0 ,

(11)

where α, β, and P0 were free parameters. With the shift of the zero point to t0 ,
the solution becomes
P (t − t0 ) = P0 exp {α(t − t0 ) − β [T (t − t0 ) − T (0)]} .

(12)

Three exercises, which use the cylcle to conﬁrm the feedback, are to ﬁt this
equation to the emissions data using the estimates from Table 1 in their corresponding models (6), (7), and (10) for T (t − t0 ). These are easy nonlinear least

squares problems. The results are given in Table 2 and Fig. 4. None of the ﬁts
is quite as good as the solid curve in Fig. 1, which had R2 = 0.9973, but all are
good enough to lend strong support to the feedback hypothesis.

Exercise 8: For Advanced Students

With the ﬁt of the CO2 -driven version (10) of the model (12), in the last exercise
above, the analysis has completed a full circle from the purely mathematical
representation (2) for the emissions to the dynamical representation (11). The
agreement between the two ﬁts, i.e. between the solid curve in Fig. 1 and the
coarsely dashed one in Fig. 4, is not perfect, but it is good enough to argue
not only that the feedback hypothesis is correct, but also that the intermediate
hypotheses (8) and (10) are least approximately correct. These results, taken
together, suggest the following dynamical models for P (t), c(t) and T (t):

to the student, is to ﬁt these three equations simultaneously to the three data
sets.
