models for surface fire spread [15], crown fire initiation [17], crown fire spread [18] and dead
fuel moisture [19, 20].
Despite extensive fire related data collection, fire prediction via direct numerical simulation
is imperiled by variability and uncertainty on the data needed to simulate the fire, along with the
approximation and empirical modeling of fire spread. Corrections on the wildfire perimeter simulation by means of a data assimilation techniques that can incorporate (noisy) measurements of
the actual wildfire perimeter is a promising technique to improve wildfire perimeter prediction.
Data assimilation techniques can be found in various wildfire spread models other than farsite
to improve wildfire perimeter prediction [3, 4]. Merging simulations and measurements of fire
perimeters may use Monte Carlo methods [5] to allow for highly large-scale spatial-temporal
simulations in a wildfire simulation. Fire spread models may have high dimensional states and
include wildfire interaction with the atmosphere [6] where Tikhonov regularization is used to
avoid nonphysical states. Some of the most recent data assimilation techniques for wildfire
spread prediction [7, 8] rely on an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [9–12] also seen in many
earth science applications [13].
The use of an EnKF for farsite has shown that fire prediction can be improved significantly
when intermittent measurements on the fire perimeter are available [14]. However, it has been
recognized that farsite computations that occur over longer temporal scales may incorrectly
predict wildfire spread due to the coarse nature of the spatial and temporal data used in the
wildfire simulation [16]. On the other hand, fuel adjustment factors available in farsite can
adjust the rate of spread for each fuel type independently, allowing compensations of errors and
inaccuracy in fuel models, fuel moistures and improperly represented variability in local winds
caused by the widlfire.
This paper shows that time varying fuel adjustment factors in farsite can be used effectively
to fine-tune a fire simulation and address the aforementioned shortcomings. The fuel adjustment
factor vector only has a finite dimension determined by the number of fuel models used during
the fire simulation. It is shown that any subset of the fuel adjustment vector can be added to the
state vector representing the fire perimeter, whereas data assimilation based on the EnKF can
be used to update both the fire perimeters and fuel adjustment factors. The data assimilation
presented in this paper shows on the basis of a case study of the 2014 Cocos fire in San Marcos,
CA that the extra degree of freedom in the data assimilation of fuel adjustment factors greatly
improves the accuracy of a fire spread prediction with farsite.

Forward Model for Wildfire Simulations

In light of the data assimilation techniques presented in this paper, farsite can be seen as a
dedicated forward-prediction model of the fire perimeter x̂k+1|k of the form
x̂k+1|k = f (x̂k|k , θ, uk , αk )

(1)

in which a distinction is made between spatially varying, but time invarying, topography and
fuel information denoted by a parameter θ, temporal (and spatially varying) wind and weather
data denoted by uk and temporal fuel adjustment factors αk , where the subindex k refers to a
integer time index. The notation x̂k+1|k is used to indicate the predicted fire perimeter at time
step k + 1 based on the data available at time step k. The numerical computations in farsite
represented by the mapping f (·) in (1) is an implicit and high dimensional forward model.
It should be noted that both the “true” fire perimeter xk and the fuel adjustment factors
αk are assumed to be unknown. For the purpose of data assimilation and improvement of fire

for forward prediction of the both fire perimeter x̂k+1|k and the adjustment factor α̂k+1|k by
the map g(). For the farsite-based wildfire data assimilation presented in this paper, the
(measured) output yk+1 in (3) refers to a spatially downsampled (coarse) measurement of the
actual fire perimeter. The map g() in (3) is implemented by the combination of x̂k+1|k =
f (x̂k|k , α̂k|k , θ, uk ) given earlier in (1) and the assumption that the adjustment factors are kept
the same during a forward simulation, e.g. α̂k+1|k = α̂k|k . It should be noted that both x̂k|k
and α̂k|k will be updated via a data assimilation step in between forward simulation steps.

Reference Data for Assimilation
Cocos Fire Simulation

As a case study for the EnKF-based data assimilation for farsite presented in this paper,
topography data and weather conditions for the May 2014 Cocos Fire in San Marcos, CA were
collected. A farsite fire simulation of the May 2014 Cocos fire is used to generate a reference
data set of the hourly “true” fire perimeters xk+1 and “true” adjustment factors αk+1 . It
should be noted that this reference data is representative of the actual Cosos fire and used
as a replacement for the actual measurements that are not available at an hourly basis. The
reference data serves only to evaluate the performance of the data assimilation tools in this
paper when fire simulations are started at the wrong initial conditions in terms of (initial) fire
perimeter x0 or adjustment factor α0 .

Figure 1: Reference data for assimilation performance evaluation: hourly updates of the state
xk (fire perimeter) initialized at the extended state ẑ0 that include the initial square 30m×30m
ignition boundary x0 and the 13 dimensional fuel adjustment vector αk = [11×4 1/2 11×8 ]T ∀k.

To generate the reference data for the EnKF-based data assimilation for farsite, 13 different
fuel types were used in farsite but fuel type number 5 was found to be most dominant over the
topography covering the May 2014 Cocos Fire. For the purpose of illustrating fuel adjustment
data assimilation, the entries of the (time dependent) 13 × 1 vector of adjustment factors αk in
(2) are all set to a 1, except for the 5th entry αk,5 . During the farsite computations used to
generate the reference data, both a constant value αk,5 = 1/2 and a time varying value αk,5 is
used. For the constant value αk,5 = 1/2, the simulated fire perimeters xk are depicted in Fig. 1
over a 18 hour time period and a 90m spatial resolution along the perimeter, starting from an
initial square 30m×30m ignition boundary x0 .
For the purposes of combined fire perimeter and fuel adjustment factor data assimilation,
only the non-unity 5th entry α̂k,5 of the full size adjustment factor vector α̂k is included in the
extended state ẑk in (2) along with the fire perimeters x̂k . As a result, the data assimilation
will attempt to estimate the partial extended state zk , containing the fire perimeter xk and
only the scalar adjustment factor αk,5 .

3.2

Observations and Initial Information

Measurements are introduced in the data assimilation via spatially down-sampled and noisy
observations of the 90m spatial resolution ‘’true” state xk+1 given by the output
yk+1 = [Ck+1 0] zk+1 + vk+1

(4)

where Ck+1 is a downsampling matrix. The output measurements yk+1 are produced at a
spatial resolution of 360m along the fire perimeter and perturbed by a white noise vk+1 with a
standard deviation of 50m.
In addition, it is assumed that the initial value of the extended state z0 is not known at the
start of the data assimilation procedure. Instead, an estimate of a mean value z̄0|0 = z0 along
z
with a covariance matrix P0|0
is used. The mean value
z̄0|0 =

describes both the estimate of the initial ignition boundary x̄0|0 , as well as the value of the
initial adjustment factors ᾱ0|0 for the fuel models included in the extended state. To formalize
the concepts of the covariance matrix, consider x̄0|0 to be given in eastern ei and northern ni

Ensemble Kalman Filter with farsite

The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [9, 10] is a Monte-Carlo implementation of the Bayesian
update problem. Given a probability distribution of the extended state zk (the prior) and measurement likelihood, the Bayes theorem is used to obtain the probability distribution with the
measurements yk+1 in (4) taken into account (the posterior). The EnKF-based data assimilation for farsite is based on the work in [14] and will be presented in two computational steps.
The first step consists of creating ensembles and the forward simulation using a farsite in (3).
The second step consists of a state adjustment based on a time varying Kalman gain Kk+1
computed by estimating covariance matrices via ensemble averaging. The two computational
steps can be summarized as follows:

Assimilation with Constant Fuel Adjustment Factors
Forward Simulation without Data Assimilation

To illustrate the need for data assimilation on the Cocos Fire reference data, first a forward
simulation from farsite with an initial value of the extended state vector ẑ0 = z0 . A side-byside comparison can be made between the “true” fire perimeters xk+1 given earlier in Fig. 1
and the fire perimeters x̂k+1 obtained by the forward simulation from farsite initialized with
the state ẑ0 = z0 in Fig. 2. It is clear that the relatively small initial error due to x̂0 = x0
between the initial fire perimeters and α̂0,5 = α0,5 between the 5th entry adjustment factors
leads to a growing divergence of the state error x̂k − xk over time.

Figure 2: farsite simulation without data assimilation: hourly updates of the state xk (fire
perimeter) initialized at the extended state ẑ0 = z0 that includes an initial square 30m×30m
ignition boundary x̂0 with an offset of 215m in eastern direction and 730m in northern direction
compared to x0 and an initial value of the 5th fuel adjustment factor α̂0,5 = 1 compared to
α0,5 = 1/2.
An alternative representation that illustrates the growing divergence of the state error x̂k −xk
is the state RMS error depicted in Fig. 3. It can be observed that the state RMS error increases

even more drastically when an incorrect adjustment factor is included in the state. Clearly,
data assimilation is needed to account for the lack of such information to reduce the error and
variance on the fire perimeter.

Intermittent Data Assimilation with Adjustment Factors

To show the progress of the state RMS error in case of data assimilation, first the definition of
z
of the extended state ẑ0 must be given. For the 4 points in
the initial covariance matrix P0|0
the initial square fire perimeter x̂0 , the covariance matrices given by

are used to describe the variance of 5m on the 4 points and 150m on the center xc of the
initial square fire perimeter. The covariance matrices in (14) are used in (6) to formulate the

. The uncertainty of the 5th entry of the
covariance matrix of the initial fire perimeter P0|0

adjustment factor is described by a variance σα = 0.04 and combining the covariance of the
z

= diag{P0|0

initial state ẑ0|0 is set via P0|0
adjustment factors in the extended state, two data assimilation approaches are compared:
• Approach A: partial state data assimilation. In this case the state is defined as ẑk = [x̂k ]

and only contains the fire perimeter with an initial covariance P0|0
• Approach B: extended state data assimilation. In this case the extended state ẑk =
[x̂k α̂k,5 ]T and a combination of both fire perimeter and 5th fuel adjustment factor with
z
x
= diag{P0|0
, σα2 }.
an initial covariance matrix P0|0
For both data assimilation approaches, the same measurements yk+1 are provided and data
assimilation steps are performed at every 4th time step (4 hours) starting at k = 1. For
performance comparison, again the hourly mean of the RMS state error is computed and the
results are summarized in Fig. 4. The results in Fig. 4 illustrate two important observations
with respect to the performance of the data assimilation.
First of all, it can be seen that the mean RMS state error slowly increases at the hourly
time steps when no data assimilation is performed, similar to what was observed in Fig. 2.
Only at the data assimilation steps, the mean RMS error of the state estimation drastically
drops to a lower value, illustrating the performance of the EnKF-based data assimilation for
farsite. Secondly, it can be observed from Fig. 4 that after a few data assimilation steps, the

mean RMS state error during assimilation with fuel adjustment factors (Approach B) is always
less than the mean RMS state error without adjustment factors (Approach A). The adjustment
factor initially increases to compensate for a large initial error in the initial fire perimeter, but
decreasing afterwards.

farsite with adjustment factors (Approach B) versus a EnKF-based data assimilation using
farsite without adjustment factors (Approach A).

Assimilation with Time Varying Fuel Adjustments

Next to reducing the mean RMS state error, it is also important to keep track of any time
varying fuel adjustment factor αk . For that purpose, the EnKF-based data assimilation for
farsite can be used to track the ”true” 5th entry α̂0,5 = α0,5 of the adjustment factor vector
αk using hourly down-sampled noisy measurements of the true fire perimeter. For tracking time
varying behavior of the fuel adjustment factor α0,5 is modeled as a random walk
αk+1,5 = αk,5 + wk

(15)

where wk is white noise ∼ N (0, 0.1) and α0 = 0.5. The same random walk model as in (15) is
used for the forward simulation of the adjustment factor α̂(k+1|k),5 .
To illustrate the performance of the EnKF-based data assimilation for farsite to track
hourly time varying fuel adjustment factors, hourly data assimilation steps are performed here,
but initial errors in either fire perimeter x0 and/or the adjustment factor α0,5 is considered
according the the following two scenarios:
1. Scenario 1: full initial extended state error ẑ0 = [x̂0 α̂0,5 ] = [x0 α0,5 ], similar as in
Section 5.2.
2. Scenario 2: partial extanded state error with only an initial fuel adjustment factor error
α̂0,5 = α0,5 and no error on the initial fire perimeter x̂0 = x0 .

Again the same measurements yk+1 are provided to both Scenario 1 and 2, while data
assimilation steps are performed hourly on the extended state (Approach B). For performance
comparison we compare the ”true” scalar 5th entry αk,5 of the adjustment factor vector αk with
the estimated α̂k,5 for both scenarios listed above and the results are summarized in Fig. 5.
As intuitively expected and confirmed by the results in Fig. 5, the tracking of the (5th entry
of the) fuel adjustment factor αk,5 is more accurate for Scenario 2 (bottom figure) with only
an initial fuel adjustment factor error α̂0,5 = α0,5 . It can also be observed that the estimate
of (5th entry of the) fuel adjustment factor αk,5 for Scenario 1 (top figure) maintains an error
at the first few hourly data assimilation steps. The value of the fuel adjustment factor α̂(k|k),5

accelerate the fire growth and reduce the errors on the estimate on the fire perimeter xk .

Conclusions

This paper shows how the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to extend farsite with
data assimilation capabilities to update both fire perimeters and fuel adjustment factors on
the basis of noisy and spatially downsampled measurements of a fire perimeter. The update
step in the EnKF-based data assimilation for farsite updates both a fire perimeter estimate
and a fuel adjustment factor estimate on the basis of the Kalman filter gain that exploits
the uncertainty information on the simulated fire perimeter, fuel adjustment factors and a
measured fire perimeter. Based on a case study of the May 2014 Cocos fire in San Marcos, CA
it is shown how the presence of an adjustment factor can improve the RMS error of the fire
perimeter estimate, even for reduced hourly updates during the data assimilation steps. The
same reference data of the May 2014 Cocos fire is used to show performance of the EnKF-based
data assimilation for farsite for tracking time varying fuel adjustment factors.
