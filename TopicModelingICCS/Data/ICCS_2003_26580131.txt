Abstract. We consider two step Runge-Kutta-Nystr¨
om methods for the
numerical integration of y = f (x, y) having periodic or oscillatory solutions. We assume that the frequency ω can be estimated in advance.
Using the linear stage representation, we describe how to derive two
step Runge-Kutta-Nystr¨
om methods which integrate trigonometric and
mixed polynomials exactly. The resulting methods depend on the parameter ν = ωh, where h is the stepsize.

Introduction

We are concerned with the second order initial value problem
y (t) = f (t, y(t)),

y(t0 ) = y0 ,

y (t0 ) = y0 ,

y(t), f (t, y) ∈ Rn ,

(1)

having periodic or oscillatory solutions, which describes many processes in technical sciences. Examples are given in celestial mechanics, molecular dynamics,
seismology, and so on.
For ODEs of type (1), in which the ﬁrst derivative does not appear explicitly, it is preferable to use a direct numerical method, instead of reducing the
ODEs (1) into a ﬁrst order system. An interesting and important class of initial
value problems (1) which can arise in practice consists of problems whose solutions are known to be periodic, or to oscillate with a known frequency. Classical
methods require a very small stepsize to track the oscillations and only methods
which take advantage of some previous knowledge about the solution are able
to integrate the system using a reasonable large stepsize. Therefore, eﬃciency
can be improved by using numerical methods in which a priori information on
the solution (as for instance, a good estimate of the period or of the dominant
frequency) can be embedded.
In the following let us assume that a good estimate of the dominant frequency ω is known in advance. The aim is to exploit this extra information and
to modify a given integration method in such a way that the method parameters
are ‘tuned’ to the behavior of the solution. Such an approach has already been
proposed by Gautschi in 1961 [6] for linear multistep methods for ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential equations in which the dominant frequencies ωj are a priori known.

Exploiting this idea, many numerical methods with coeﬃcients depending on the
predicted frequency are available in literature. Paternoster introduced Runge–
Kutta–Nystr¨
om methods based on trigonometric polynomials [10], and methods
resulting exact in phase when the high frequency component is produced by a
linear part [11]. Coleman et al. considered methods based on mixed collocation
[4]. In the class of exponential–ﬁtted methods many methods are available in
literature. Ixaru in [7] focused on the numerical formulae associated with operations on oscillatory functions. Then many papers followed, we only cite here
some of them [8,14,15,16]; see also the references therin.
In this paper we consider two step Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om methods for (1)
having periodic or oscillatory solutions, for which a good estimate of the frequency is known in advance. We treat the TSRKN method as a composite linear
multistep scheme, as done in Albrecht’s approach [1,2]. Following the approach
of [6,10,12], we deﬁne the trigonometric order of the methods. In section 2 we
recall the conditions to obtain two step Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om methods which
integrate algebraic polynomials exactly. In section 3 we give the deﬁnition of
trigonometric order of the TSRKN method, and state the conditions to satisfy
for integrating trigonometric polynomials exactly.

Two Step Runge-Kutta-Nystr¨
om Methods

The TSRKN method (2), introduced in [13], was derived as an indirect
method from the two step Runge–Kutta method presented in [9]. In comparison with classical one step Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om methods, TSRKN methods
need a lower number of stages to rise to a given order of convergence. Indeed,
advancing from xi to xi+1 , we only have to compute Yi , because Yi−1 have already been evaluated in the previous step. Therefore the computational cost of
the method depends on the matrix A, while the vector v adds extra degrees of
freedom.
It is known that the method (2) is zero–stable if [13]
−1 < θ ≤ 1

(4).

We treat formulas (2) by extending Albrecht’s technique [1,2] to the numerical
method we considered, as in [10,12]. According to this approach, we regard the
TSRKN method (2) as a composite linear multistep scheme on a not equidistant
grid.
j
Yi−1
and Yij in (2) are called internal stages; yi+1 and yi+1 are the ﬁnal stages,
which give the approximation of the solution and its derivative of the solution
in the step point xi .
We associate a linear diﬀerence operator with each internal stage YiJ of (2),
in the following way:
Lj [z(x); h] = z(x + cj h) − z(x) − hcj z (x) − h2

h2

m
j=1 (vj z

(x + (cj − 1)h) + wj z (x + cj h))

is associated with the ﬁnal stage yi+1 in (2). It follows that
Lj [1; h] = Lj [x; h] = 0,

j = 1, . . . , m,

which implies that y(xi + cj h) − Yij = O(h) for h → 0. Moreover
¯ h] = L¯ [1; h] = L¯ [x; h] = 0,

j = 1, . . . , m,

C2 (p), B2 (p) and B2 (p) allow the reduction of order conditions of trees in the
theory of two step RKN methods, which is under development by the author of
this paper; moreover they also mean that all the quadrature formulas represented
by the TSRKN method have order at least p, similarly as it happens in the theory
of Runge–Kutta methods [3].
The following theorem can be obviously proved by using Albrecht’s theory
[1,2]:

Theorem 1. If C2 (p), B2 (p) and B2 (p) hold, then the m–stage TSRKN method
(1.2) has order of convergence p.
Proof. C2 (p), B2 (p) and B2 (p) imply that all the stages of the method have order
p or, in Albrecht’s terminology, that each stage in (2) has order of consistency p,
so that the method has order of consistency p. In this case the method converges
with order at least p.
It is worth mentioning that the conditions C2 (p), B2 (p) and B2 (p) are only sufﬁcient conditions for the TSRKN method to have order p, but not necessary.
Indeed the ﬁnal stage must have order of consistency p, which is the condition
B2 (p), but it is not necessary that also the internal stages have order of consistency p. If all the stages have order of consistency p, then they are exact on
any linear combination of the power set {1, x, x2 , . . . , xp }, and this implies that
the TSRKN method results exact when the solutions of the system of ODEs(1)
are algebraic polynomials. Moreover the simplifying conditions C2 (p), B2 (p) and
B2 (p) are a constructive help for the derivation of new numerical methods within
the class of TSRKN methods having a high order stage, and will be a useful basis
for characterizing collocation TSRKN methods.

Trigonometric Polynomials

Now, we can consider TSRKN methods which integrate ODEs (1) having periodic or oscillatory solutions, which can be expressed through trigonometric
polynomials.
Let us suppose that a good approximation of the dominant frequency ω is
known in advance, and that (4) and (8) hold, so that the method is convergent
with order at least one.
Following Gautschi [6] and [10,12], we state now the deﬁnition of trigonometric order.

with ν = ωh.
It is already known that methods with trigonometric order q have algebraic order
2q (see [6,10] for the deﬁnition of algebraic order) and therefore have order of
convergence 2q.
It is easy to verify that a TSRKN method has trigonometric order q, according to Deﬁnition 4, if its parameters satisfy the following systems:

The following theorem states some constructive conditions to derive TSRKN
methods giving exact solution (within the roundoﬀ) error when the solution of
ODEs (1) is a mixed polynomial which oscillates with frequency ω.
Theorem 2. If the coeﬃcients of the TSRKN method satisfy the conditions
C2 (p), B2 (p), B2 (p) and A(q), V W θ(q), V W θ(q), then the TSRKN method integrates any linear combination of {1, x, x2 , . . . , xp , cos ωx, sin ωx, cos 2ωx, sin 2ωx,
. . . , cos qωx, sin qωx} exactly.
The construction of the methods requires the solutions of the linear systems
C2 (p), B2 (p), B2 (p) and A(q), V W θ(q), V W θ(q), which is underdetermined. It

is possible to solve the uncoupled linear systems after ﬁxing some free parameters. Through symbolic computation it is possible to determine the analytical
expressions of the remaining parameters of the method; for a high number of
stages the involved systems have to be solved numerically.

Conclusions

Numerical methods for (1) having frequency–dependent parameters are quite
widely used methods [4,5,6,8,10,11,14,15,16], when a good approximation of the
frequency ω to be ﬁtted is a priori available. In this paper we design the approach
to be used in the derivation of two step Runge–Kutta–Nystr¨
om methods in the
case that only one frequency is ﬁtted, but the development of TSRKN methods
in which more frequencies are ﬁtted can be considered as well. The linear stability
analysis of these methods has not be considered in this paper, and has to follow
the lines drawn in [5,8,4].
Recently some authors [16] addressed the problem of how choosing the optimal value of the frequency to predict, and this new perspective enlarges the
sphere of application of methods with ν–dependent parameters, where ν is given
by the product of the ﬁtted frequency and the stepsize.
The coeﬃcients of methods which are frequency–dependent involve combinations of trigonometric functions.
It is known that a common feature of this type of methods is that heavy cancelations occur during the evaluation of the coeﬃcients from their closed form,
which becomes increasingly severe as ν tends to 0. Therefore, in the application,
the expansions of the coeﬃcients in powers of ν, generated for example by Maple
or Mathematica, is strongly recommended.
