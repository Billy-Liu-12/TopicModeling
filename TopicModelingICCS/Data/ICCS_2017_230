This paper mainly focuses on morph resolution: given a morph, ﬁgure out the entity that
it really refers to. The morph resolution is very diﬃcult because of the following challenges:
1) The distributions of co-occurrence of morphs and their target entities are quite diﬀerent
in diﬀerent social media;
2) Most morphs were created according to the semantic links between morphs and their
target entities based on historical and cultural narratives [1];
3) Tweets from Twitter or Chinese Sina Weibo are short text and noisy. Therefore it is not
easy to extract enough evidences and contexts for morph resolution.
Huang et al. [1] did a pioneering study on morph resolution, but their method used a large
amount of human-annotated data and their approach was context-independent. Zhang et al.
[2] summarized 548 randomly selected morphs into 8 categories. Zhang et al. [3] proposed the
ﬁrst end-to-end context-aware entity morph decoding system. But they did not take consider
of the semantic links of characters of morphs and target entities.
In this paper, we propose a framework based on character-word embeddings and radicalcharacter-word embeddings to explore the semantic links between morphs and target entities.
First, we analyse the common characteristics shared among morphs and target entities from
temporal distribution, topic similarity, and cross-sources datasets. Then based on these common
characteristics, we collect target candidates. Next, we get the semantic meanings of morphs and
target candidates based on character-word embeddings and radical-character-word. Finally, we
rank target candidates based on similarity measurement of semantic meanings of morphs and
target candidates. Using this method, we take consider of both the external semantic meanings
(word) and internal semantic meanings (radical and character) of morphs and target candidates.
Our approach does not require any manually constructed morph-target entities pairs for
training and outperforms the state-of-the-art method [3]. The results also show that the performance is better when morphs share any character with target entities (The accuracy can
reach 87%).
Our paper oﬀers the following contributions:
1) In order to narrow down the scope of target candidates and not leave out real target
entities, we set the threshold of temporal slot to 4 days.
2) In order to quickly and eﬃciently resolve the real target entities, we collect target candidates based on heterogeneous information from multiple sources.
3) we propose a framework based on character-word embeddings and radical-character-word
embeddings to address the issue of morph resolution using both external semantic links
and internal semantic links.

2 Related Work
Morph resolution is closely related to alias detection [4]. Other similar research include
mining name translation pairs from comparable corpora [5] and link prediction [6]. Most of
the work focused on unstructured and structured data with clean and rich relations. It has
been demonstrated these techniques did not perform well when directly applying on morph
resolution.
To our knowledge, Huang et al. [1] proposed the ﬁrst work on morph resolution, their results
have served as a benchmark for this problem. Zhang et al. [2] summarized 548 randomly selected
morphs into 8 categories: (1) Phoentic Substitution; (2) Spelling Decomposition; (3) Nickname
Generation; (4) Translation and Transliteration; (5) Semantic Interpretation; (6) Historical

Figure Mapping; (7) Characteristics Modeling; (8) Reputation and Public Perception. Zhang
proposed some approaches to encode entity morphs. Zhang et al. [3] also proposed the ﬁrst
work on context-aware end-to-end morph identiﬁcation and morph resolution. But they did not
consider the semantic relations of characters between morphs and target entities. Bamman et
al. [7] discovered politically sensitive terms from Chinese Sina Weibo tweets based on analyzing
social media behaviors. Some work attempted to map between Chinese formal words and
informal words [8][9].
Word embedding is to represent each word as a real valued low-dimensional vector, through
which the semantic meaning of the word can be encoded. Recent years have witnessed tremendous success of word embedding in various NLP tasks [10][11]. Among existing approaches, the
continuous bag-of-words model (CBOW) is simple and eﬀective [12]. Chen et al. [13] presented a character-enhanced word embedding model (CWE) to integrate the internal knowledge
(character) and external knowledge (word) to represent the semantic meanings of words. Yin
et al. [14]proposed a multi-granularity embeddings (MGE) to enrich word embeddings by
incorporating semantics from characters and radicals.

3 Problem Formulation
Morph resolution: Given a morph, our goal is to develop a framework which can ﬁgure
out its real target entities. Given documents set D = {d1 , d2 , . . . , d|D| } and a corpus of tweets
T = {t1 , t2 , . . . , t|T | } which include the morph m, that is mϵtk , k = 1, 2, ..., |T |. Our task is
to discover a list of target candidates from D, and rank the target candidates based on the
probability of being the real target entity.
An example of morph resolution is shown on Figure 1. The input is a piece of tweet which
includes a morph, such as “小马哥”(Little Brother Ma), the output is a list of target entities
which are ranked on the probability of being the real target entity. In this example, the real
target entity is “马英九”(Ma Ying-jeou).

4 Resolving Morphs based on Character-Word Embeddings
Morph resolution mainly consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2.
1. Collect Target Candidates This step aims to narrow down the scope of target candidates without leaving out the real target entities. We takes advantage of the common
characteristics shared among morphs and target entities. First, relevant tweets that include morphs are retrieved. Next, we collect corpora D1 from multiple sources including
Twitter, Chinese Sina Weibo, and Web News during the time slot of relevant tweets.
Therefore, we can get candidate dataset D2 by computing topic similarity between tweets
including morphs and tweets in D1. Finally, we use Chinese segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, and name tagging to extract target candidates set from dataset D2.
2. Rank Target Candidates This step is to verify whether a discovered target candidate is
indeed a real target entity of this morph. First, we get the semantic meanings of morphs
and target candidates by joint learning character-word embeddings and radical-characterword embeddings using deep learning techniques. Second, we rank the target candidates
based on similarity measurement of semantic meanings of morphs and target candidates.

In the following sections, we will address common characteristics shared among morphs and
target entities and give details about collecting target candidates and ranking target candidates.

4.1 Common Characteristics of Morphs and Target Entities
4.1.1 Temporal Relations between Morphs and Target Entities
We randomly select 100 morphs and their target entities, and analyse their temporal distributions. Figure 3 shows the temporal distributions of two pairs of representative morph and
target entity: 1) Morph (乔帮主 -Jobs Master) vs. Target Entity (乔布斯 -Steve Jobs); 2)
Morph (周董 - Chairman Zhou) vs. Target Entity (周杰伦 -Jay Chou)3 . Dataset includes Sina
Weibo and Twitter. It is clear that morphs and their target entities appear nearly simultaneously in Sina Weibo and Twitter. We observed that nearly 99% target entities appeared within
four days after morph’s appearance. Then we furtherly reduce the scope of candidate corpora
by setting the threshold of temporal slot to 4 days. In contrast, Huang set the threshold to 7
days based on a heuristic method [1].
4.1.2 The topic similarity of morphs and target entities
Internet users use morph to replace the real target entity for whatever reasons. Although
a morph and its target entity may have very diﬀerent surface forms, they intend to appear in
similar semantic contexts which usually mean similar topics and events. For example, Figure

Figure 3: The Temporal Distributions of Morphs and Target Entities in Sina Weibo and Twitter
4 shows two pieces of tweets in Sina Weibo. Although, The President of the United States is
called “obama” in People’s Daily, but is called “Staring at the sea”in “Today Wall Street”.
These tweets are all about Sino American diplomacy. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that
morphs and target entities are always in the context of expressing similar topics or events, and
show semantic links by the similar context. Then we can extract and explore these kinds of
semantic links, and rank target candidate entities based the semantic similarity.

4.1.3 The Co-Occurrence Distributions of Morphs and Target Entities
Morphs always be used in informal documents, such as Sina Weibo where users have more
freedom to express their opinions; however, target entities usually be used in formal documents,
such as Web News where users use more formal expression. But the co-occurrence distributions
of morphs and target entities are quite diﬀerent in diﬀerent sources for diﬀerent morphs. As
Table 1 shows, morph “呆丸”(Dai Wan) often appeared in Sina Weibo, but seldom appeared
in Web News; In contrast, some politically sensitive morphs, such as “陈光诚”(Guangcheng
Chen), nearly never appeared in Sina Weibo. Therefore, in order not to leave out the real target
entities in target candidates, we need to collect target candidates from multiple sources.

4.2 Target Candidates Collecting
The scope of the target candidates will be too big if we select target candidates from all of
these corpora. Because there are a lot of no necessary words in these corpora. On the other
hand, if we select the dataset is too small, we maybe cannot ﬁnd the real target entities of
morphs. So the key point of this sub-task is how to select the appropriate size of the dataset.
To solve this problem, we mainly consider the following points : 1) morphs and target entities
are highly consistent in temporal distribution; 2) morphs and target entities have highly similar
topic and semantic relations; 3) The co-occurrence distributions of morphs and target entities
is quite diﬀerent in diﬀerent resources.
Figure 5 shows the procedure of collecting target candidates. First, relevant tweets that
include morphs are retrieved. Then we get the morph’s appearing time by extracting the
published time of these tweets. Based on the morph’s appearing time, we set a time slot of 4

Figure 5: The procedure of Target Candidates Collecting

54

days to collect corpora D1 for getting target candidates from multiple resources. Second, we
get candidate corpora D2 by computing topic similarity between tweets which include morphs
and tweets in D1 using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and Doc2Vec. In order to use LDA
and Doc2Vec methods, we treat a piece of tweet as a document. Finally, we use Chinese
segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and name tagging to extract target candidates set
from dataset D2.

4.3 Target Candidates Ranking
In order to rank the target candidates, we need to explore the semantic similarity of morph
and target entities. Based on the descending order of the semantic similarity, we select Top-k
candidates as the ﬁnal answers based on the answer size k. We also prefer unsupervised learning
methods due to the lack of training data.
Based on the distributional hypothesis [15] which claims that words that occur in similar
contexts tend to have similar meanings, we try to use deep learning techniques to ﬁgure out
the target entities of a morph by their semantic representations. In Chinese, a word is usually
composed of several characters and contains rich internal information. The semantic meaning
of a word is also related to the meanings of its composing characters. Furthermore, most of
Chinese characters themselves can be further divided into components such as radicals (部首).
Radicals may suggest the semantic meaning of a word. In a nutshell, the semantic meaning of
a Chinese word can be revealed by its context, its characters, and its radicals.
For ranking target candidates, we mainly consider the following key factors: context relations, characters relations, and radicals relations between morphs and target entities. Hence,
we propose character-word embeddings and radical-character-word embeddings to represent the
semantic meanings of morphs and target entities.
We make a large amount of unlabeled data including social media, website, blog, and WeiBo
to learn the semantic representations of morphs and target entities based on character-word
embeddings (CWE) and radical-character-word embeddings (RCWE). CWE is a characterenhanced word embedding model, which learns embeddings jointly for words and characters.
RCWE is a word embedding model for chinese words. Its key idea is to make full use of wordcharacter-radical composition, and enrich word embeddings by using ﬁner-grained semantics
meanings from radicals [13][14]. Figure 6 shows how to train morphs and target entities embeddings on character-word embeddings (CWE) architecture and radical-character-word embeddings (RCWE) architecture. Following the similar optimization scheme as that of CBOW
used in [12], we use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize CWE and RCWE models.
Gradients are calculated using the back-propagation algorithm. We initialize character-word
embeddings and radical-character-word embeddings at random like CBOW. In this way, We
not only consider the context of morphs and target entities, but also consider the component
of morphs and target entities: characters and radicals.
After getting the embeddings of morphs and target entities, we can select Top-k candidates
as the ﬁnal answers based on semantic similarity of morph and target candidates.

5 Experiments and Analysis
5.1 Datasets and experiments settings
Experiments use two datasets: 1)The ﬁrst dataset come from Zhang’s paper [3]: they collected 1546988 tweets from Chinese Sina Weibo from May 1,2012 to June 30,2012, and retrieved

Figure 8: Morphs Resolution Acc@k.

25003 Chinese tweets from Twitter at the same period of time, and 66559 web documents from
the embedded URLs in tweets; This dataset consisted of 450 pairs of morphs and target entities. 2) We also asked three annotators to analyze the social media data, and discovered new
225 pairs of morphs and target entities. Because most morphs tend to appear in Twitter, we
collected 337113 Chinese tweets from Twitter from May 1, 2015 to June 1, 2015. Retweets and
duplicate tweets or web documents are all ﬁltered out.

5.2 Target Candidates Collecting
If the target candidates set covers the real target entities, we can think that we have selected
the right target candidates set. We select 557 pairs of morphs and target entities, use our target
candidates collecting method to verify the relations between the coverage of target candidates
set and the time slot.
As Figure 7 shows, if we set the time slot of Sina Weibo to 1 day, Twitter to 3 days, and
Web News to 1 day, we can get the coverage of target candidates set nearly 96%. We also study

the inﬂuence of time slot on the size of target candidates set. If we do not set the time slot,
the average size of target candidates set per morph is 121590. In the contrast, if we set the
time slot, the average size of target candidates set per morph sharply drop to 6130. The size
of target candidates set can be reduced nearly 20 times. By setting the time slot, we can get
better trade-oﬀ between coverage of target candidates set and the size of target candidates set.

5.3 Target Candidates Ranking
We use character-word embeddings to get the semantic meanings of morphs and target
candidates, compute the cosine similarity of morphs and target candidates, and rank the target
candidates based on the similarity measurement. When training the embeddings, we set vector
dimension as 300 and context window size as 5. For optimization, we use both hierarchical
softmax and 10-word negative sampling.
To evaluate the system performance, we use leave-one-out cross validation by computing
accuracy as Acc@k = Ck /Q, where Ck is the total number of correctly resolved morphs at
top-k ranked answers, and Q is the total number of morph queries. We consider a morph as
correctly resolved at the top-k answers if the top-k answer set contains the real target entities
of the morph.
The system performance is shown in Table 2 and Figure 8. “Huang 13” and “Zhang 15”
represent Huang and Zhang’s methods respectively [1][3]. “cwe_all” represents our CWE embeddings method on all 675 pairs of morphs and target entities. “cwe_part” represents our
CWE method on 327 pairs of morphs and target entities which share with some characters,
and “rcwe_all” represents our RCWE embeddings method on all 675 pairs of morphs and target
entities. Overall, the results demonstrate that our CWE embedding approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art method [3]. This indicates that capturing both external semantic correlations
and internal semantic correlations are very important for morph resolution. But the accuracy
of “rcwe_all” is even lower than Huang’s method. Maybe the reason is that this kind of morphs
and target entities which share with some radicals is minority after all. In order to improve the
accuracy, we need to further adjust the weights of radicals in a word.
We also discover an interesting phenomenon: Just as Figure 1 shows, morph “小马哥”
(Little Ma Brother) refers to target entity “马英九”(Ma Ying-jeou). “马英九”(Ma Yingjeou)’s another morph “马娘娘”(Ma Madam) also appeared in target candidates, and is at
the top-2 position. So we can use our method to ﬁgure out other morphs and further improve
the accuracy of morph resolution by using more than one morphs simultaneously.

6 Conclusion
In this paper we introduce internal character information into morph resolution. We propose
a morph resolution framework based on character-word embeddings. Experimental results show
9

that the employing of character embeddings can consistently and signiﬁcantly improve the
quality of morph resolution. This indicates the necessity of considering internal information
for morph resolution in languages such as Chinese. This paper presents an addition operation
for semantic composition between word and character embeddings. We may explore more
sophisticated composition models to build character-word embeddings.
