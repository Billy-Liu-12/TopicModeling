Abstract. With the technological growth of the AV(Audio and Video)
equipments and the popularization of video contents, IEEE1394 for the
transmission of AV data has spread fast. However, DLNA(Digital Living
Network Alliance), which is a standard of the home network middleware, does not consider the transmission of AV data over IEEE1394. In
this paper, we propose a scheme for transmission of AV contents over
IEEE1394 in DLNA environments. In addition, by the validation test of
DLNA compatibility, we show that our proposed scheme can support AV
contents sharing without regard to the manufactures and transmission
media.
Keywords: AV, DLNA, IEEE1394.

Introduction

With the progress of various IT technologies and the proliferation of high speed
access networks and digital convergence, the concern on home network environments has increased and many home network middleware technologies and standards have been presented [1]. Digital Living Network Alliance(DLNA) presents
the Home Network Device Interoperability Guidelines v1.0 for sharing the AV
(Audio and Video) contents [2,3]. However, these guidelines support only HTTPGET method as the basic protocol for transmission of AV contents and do not
consider IEEE1394 that is widely being used in devices of home network environments [4,5]. Therefore, the AV devices using IEEE1394 transmit AV contents
through manufacturer speciﬁc methods in DLNA environments and there are
problems when diﬀerent manufacturer devices share the AV contents.
In this paper, we propose IEEE1394 DMS(Digital Media Server) architecture
for DLNA environments and show the implementation of the proposed IEEE1394
This research was supported by MIC, Korea under ITRC IITA-2006-(C10900603-0046).

DMS architecture and test whether our IEEE1394 DMS prototype has the
compatibility with DLNA standard.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy show
the design of our proposed IEEE1394 DMS architecture. Section 3 presents the
experimental results focusing on the DLNA compatibility. Finally, Section 4
concludes with a summary.

The Architecture of IEEE1394 DMS

The proposed IEEE1394 DMS architecture uses the IEEE1394 as the basic transmission interface and consists of Content Creation Subsystem, Content Management Subsystem, Content Storage Database, and Content Transfer Subsystem.
Figure 1 shows the IEEE1394 DMS architecture.

We constructed the software stack of our IEEE1394 DMS architecture which
consists of IEEE1394 interface, IEEE1394 device driver, IEEE1394 library, IPv4
over IEEE1394 driver, TCP/IP stack, UPnP DA(Device Architecture)/AV stack,
and DMS applications.
DLNA device using the IEEE1394 interface can get the information for the
transmission of AV contents through the device description. The device description expresses that the device has the GUID number of IEEE1394 interface and
plays the role of DLNA DMS and provides the service of UPnP DA stack and
Contents Directory, Connection Manager, and AV Transport Service of UPnP
AV stack [6,7]. In addition to these basic information, Our URI for IEEE1394
DMS using IEC61883 protocol provides additional information as follows: the
bandwidth of IEEE1394, the GUID of Isochronous Resource Manager(IRM) assigning the isochronous channel, the contents type, the GUID of IEEE1394 DMS,
and PCR number.

Implementation and Experiment Results

We implemented IEEE1394 DMS on Redhat 9 Linux platform and used IEEE1394
driver for Linux[8] and Eth1394 module, which is IPv4 over IEEE1394 driver[9].
Also, we used UPnP stack of twonkyvision [10], whose DMS is compatible with
DLNA.

Figure 2 shows the result that IEEE1394 DMP conﬁrms IEEE1394 DMS and
its service, and IEEE1394 DMS was registered as a media server.
Figure 3 shows the process that DMP selects and plays an AV content. In
Figure 3, the ﬁrst paragraph shows the result that DMP performs AVT: SetAVTra
nsportURI action including URI (iec61883://00601d00000006bd:63/disk/video/
O37.mpg?DLNA.ORG PN=MPEG PS NTSC;DLNA.OR G OP=01) for selection of the content. The second paragraph shows the response of the SetAVTransportURI action and the third paragraph shows AVT:Play action. The last
paragraph shows the response from the AVT:Play action.

In order to verify that our implemented IEEE1394 DMS has compatibility
with DLNA, we tested our system through DLNA Conformance Test Tool(CTT)
[11]. Our test items are as follows: device description, URI, DMS, contents directory service, connection manager service, GetProtocolInfo of connection manager
service, contents browsing, ProtocolInfo, and MM URI item.
In the CTT veriﬁcation, our system satisﬁed above items except for GetProtocolInfo and ProtocolInfo items. GetProtocolInfo and ProtocolInfo items are
failed in our tests because the current DLNA speciﬁcation supports only HTTPGET protocol and does not support IEC61883 protocol. In order to solve these
failures in CTT test, it is needed that the future DLNA 2.0 will have to deﬁne
IEEE1394 as transmission protocol and CTT will have to reﬂect the test items
for IEEE1394.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed the architecture of IEEE1394 DMS for sharing of
AV contents in DLNA envrionments and implemented the device description
for IEEE1394 DMS, AV Transport Service, and URI for content speciﬁcation
over IEEE1394. Also, we showed that our proposed scheme is compatible with
DLNA by testing through DLNA CTT. Our proposed IEEE1394 DMS allow
devices only with IEEE1394 interface such as TV, STB, and DVD player, to
share AV contents on DLNA environments.
