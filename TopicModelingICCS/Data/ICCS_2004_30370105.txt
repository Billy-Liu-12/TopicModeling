Abstract. A direct solver for diﬀraction problems is presented in this
paper. The solver is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the
successive elimination of lines which we call SEL. In the previous paper,
we showed the numerical algorithm by use of SEL and proved that the
limit function of approximate solutions satisﬁed the diﬀraction problem
in the sense of distribution. In this paper, the above numerical algorithm
is improved with FFT and we show that the calculation speed is faster
than the previous one.

Introduction

This paper is devoted to study the construction of ﬁnite diﬀerence solutions
based on the direct method which we call SEL and establish the numerical
algorithm by use of FFT.
Let Ω be a rectangular domain in R2 , Ω1 be an open subset of Ω and Ω2 = Ω\Ω1 ,
the interface of them be denoted by Γ (= Ω1 ∩ Ω2 ). The diﬀraction problem
considered here is the followings.
Problem I. For f ∈ L2 (Ω), σ ∈ L2 (Γ ) and g ∈ H 1/2 (∂Ω), ﬁnd {u1 , u2 } ∈
H 1 (Ω1 ) × H 1 (Ω2 ) such that

u2 = g on ∂Ω ,

Here ν is the unit normal vector on Γ directed from Ω1 to Ω2 and i is a positive
parameter (i = 1, 2).
The sysytem consisting of equations (1)-(5) is called the diﬀraction problem
([4]) and the equation (3)-(4) imposed on the surface Γ is also called the transmission conditions ([5]). The diﬀraction problems are arisen in various sciences.
One of such examples can be found in the context of electricity and { 1 , 2 } is
corresponding to the dielectric constant of the material {Ω1 , Ω2 }.

From the view point of numerical analysis, one gives w ∈ H 1/2 (Γ ), solves the

(see also [6]). Therefore one of purposes of this paper is to present a direct
method for solving (9).
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme
with distribution. Section 3 is devoted to study the construction of approximate
solutions from the viewpoint of the successive elimination of lines. Finally we
shall present a numerical algorithm by use of FFT and SEL in Section 4.

Finite Diﬀerence Scheme with Distribution
Distribution Formulation

Before proceeding to the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme, we reform Problem I as follows:
Problem II. For f ∈ L2 (Ω), σ ∈ L2 (Γ ) and g ∈ H 1/2 (∂Ω), ﬁnd u ∈ H 1 (Ω)
such that
− div (a(x, y) ∇u) = f + σ δΓ in D (Ω) ,
(10)
u = g
Here a(x, y) =

1

χΩ1 (x, y) +

2

on ∂Ω .

(11)

χΩ2 (x, y) where χΩi (i = 1, 2) is deﬁned by

χΩi (x, y) =

1 if (x, y) ∈ Ωi
0 if (x, y) ∈
/ Ωi

and δΓ is the distribution with the support on Γ .
In fact, since the equation
div (a(x, y) ∇u) = a(x) ∆u − (

1

∂u1
−
∂ν

2

∂u2
)
∂ν

in D (Ω)

holds for any u ∈ H 1 (Ω), it follows that Problem I is equivalent to Problem II
([1], [7]).
Hereafter the discretization of Problem II will be used in stead of Problem I .
2.2

Finite Diﬀerence Scheme with Distribution

Without loss of generality we assume that g = 0 and that Ω is the unit square
in R2 , i.e., Ω = {(x, y)| 0 < x, y < 1 }. Let h ∈ R be a mesh size such that
h = 1/n for an integer n and set ∆ x = ∆ y = h. We associate with it the set of
the grid points:
Ω h = {mi,j ∈ R2 | mi,j = (i h, j h), 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n},
Ωh = {mi,j ∈ R2 | mi,j = (i h, j h), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1}.
With each grid point mi,j of Ω h , we associate the panel ωi,0

respectively. We then have ([3])
Theorem 1. (i) σh → σ · δΓ in D (Ω),
(ii) uh → u weakly in L2 (Ω), u ∈ H 1 (Ω), and
(iii) u is the solution of Problem II in the sense of distrubution.

Construction of Approximate Solutions (SEL)

3.1

Vector Valued Equations

In this section we state the direct method which we call the successive elimination
of lines. Instead of the (n − 1)2 unknowns ui,j in the discrete equation (16), we
introduce the line vectors such that
Ui = t [ui,1 , ui,2 , · · · , ui,n−1 ] (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1).
Then Problem F w.r.t. {ui,j } is reduced to Problem M w.r.t. {Ui } from the
equations (16),
Problem M. Find Ui (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) satisfying

Moreover considering the geometry of the domain Ω and the interface Γ we ﬁrst
introduce sets of interface lattice points Γh and boundary lattice points ∂Ωh as
follows;
1
= ∅},
(i) Γh = {Pi,j = (ih, jh) | Γ ∩ ωi,j
(ii) ∂Ωh = Ω h \ Ωh .
Using the above notion, we divide the unknown vector {Ui } into two parts.
For each Ui = {ui,j }1≤j≤n−1 , we deﬁne Ui = {ui,j }1≤j≤n−1 and
Wi = {wi,j }1≤j≤n−1 as follows;
ui,j =

0
ui,j

if Pi,j ∈ Γh
if Pi,j ∈ Ωh \Γh ,

ui,j
0

wi,j =

if Pi,j ∈ Γh
if Pi,j ∈ Ωh \Γh

(21)

and devide Ui into two parts by
Ui = Ui + Wi .

(22)

We then introduce the new vector {Vi } deﬁned by
E
Vi = AW
i Ui ( = Ai Ui )

(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1).

(23)

From the deﬁnition of {Ui } and {Vi }, we get ([2])
E
hold (1 ≤ i ≤
Lemma 1. Ai Ui = B Vi , Aw
i Ui−1 = Vi−1 and Ai Ui+1 = Vi+1
n − 1) . Here B is a block tridiagonal matrix in the discretization of the Laplace
operator in Ω with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. i.e., B = [bij ]
is an (n − 1) × (n − 1) tridiagonal matrix such that B = tridiag[−1, 4, −1].

Therefore the following equations are derived from (18),(22),(23) and Lemma 1.
Problem PN. Find {Vi , Wi } such that for i(1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1),
B Vi = Vi−1 + Vi+1 + Fi +

where λj = arccosh(2 − cos(jπ/n)).
Remark 1. {Wi } corresponds to the approximate solution of (9).
Remark 2. Linear system w.r.t to {Wi } is dramatically less than the total system
w.r.t {ui,j }. For example, let Ω = (−0.5, 0.5) × (−0.5, 0.5) and Γ : x2 + y 2 =
(1/4)2 . Then using the notation {wij }/{ui,j } which means ’ratio’ that is the
percentage of the number of unknowns {wij } to the total number of unknowns
{uij }, we get the following table.

Hybrid Numerical Algorithm Based on FFT and SEL

4.1

Hybrid Numerical Algorithm

Recalling Theorem 3 in the previous section, we notice that the essential part is
the calculation of P α for any vector α =t (α1 , · · · , · · · , αn−1 ) and that the row
vectors of P are bases of the discrete sine transformation.
In fact,
Pα

(29)

This means that {βi } is exactly the discrete sine transform for data α.
Hence we are able to establish a numerical algorithm coupled with FFT and SEL
since it is possible to make a program of the discrete sine transform via FFT(
see [8]).
Therefore we summarize our numerical algorithm as follows.
Hybrid Numerical Algorithm
1st step: Calculate the solution {Wi } on Γh for the linear system (25).
2nd step: Compute {Vk } on Ωh \Γh by use of the formulation in Theorem 3
and FFT we stated here.

Conclusions and Further Works

In this paper we described how to calculate numerically the diﬀraction problem
by use of FFT. The formula of SEL was a mathematical approach and we showed
that the hybrid calculation coupled with FFT and SEL was eﬃcient to solve the
diﬀraction problem.
In near future we will apply this method to the heat problem near earth’s surface
in environments which is described by the systems of diﬀusion equations with
transmission conditions.
