Abstract
We consider a computational model for the evolution of methane hydrates in subsurface. Methane hydrates, an
ice-like compound abundant in subsea sediments and unstable in standard conditions, are an environmental hazard and
simultaneously an energy source. Our multiphysics model includes multiphase multicomponent mass conservation
equations and several variants of energy balance equation with or without latent heat. We present the technique of
model adaptivity which helps to assess and control the two sources of the computational error: the discretization error
and the modeling error. The nature and magnitude of the modeling error is strongly dependent on the application and
smoothness of solutions.

1. Introduction
In this paper we consider a multiphysics computational model for methane hydrates. Methane hydrates, ice-like
structures present in subsea sediments, are stable only at low temperatures and high pressures, and are an environmental hazard and an energy source [1, 2, 3]. We are interested in the assessment and control of the computational error
for various variants of the model.
When modeling complex phenomena one has to assess and control two sources of computational modeling error:
the discretization error and the modeling error. Consider an exact model of a complex phenomenon M(u) = 0, u ∈ Υ,
where u denotes a set of primary unknowns and Υ the state space. In practice one solves for uh ∈ Υh its computational
counterpart
Mh (uh ) = 0, uh ∈ Υh ,

(1)

where Υh
Υ is of ﬁnite dimension, and h is the grid parameter. The computational error u − uh arises from
approximation error of Υ by Υh as well as from the modeling approximation M → Mh due to, e.g., numerical
integration, linearization, or decoupling.

˜ h (u˜ h ) = 0 which is a discretization of some modiﬁed model M
˜
Now consider a modiﬁed computational model M
close to M, or a modiﬁcation of Mh . The idea is that the solutions u˜ h are easier to obtain than those of (1) and that the
additional modeling error that arises is of similar order of magnitude as the discretization error for (1). To asses and
control the error u − u˜ h we can use the splittings

discretization error in M

The discretization error(s) u − uh or u˜ − u˜ h can be estimated and controlled via a-posteriori error estimators and grid
adaptivity techniques which are most successful for linear scalar model problems but are nontrivial to formulate for
highly nonlinear coupled problems, see [4, 5, 6, 7] for representative references for model problems.
However, it is not obvious how to handle the modeling error u − u˜ or uh − u˜ h ; its nature and magnitude is strongly
application dependent and this error may be expensive to estimate except for simple model scalar problems. As an
indicator of the modeling error we propose to use uH − u˜ H which is relatively inexpensive to obtain if H >> h.
Theoretical foundation can be found in [8]; in this paper we present an illustration how this works for a complex
system.
Speciﬁcally, let (1) represent a coupled transient system of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) describing the evolution of methane hydrates in subsurface. Some of the components (u)c of the unknowns u may exhibit
sharp fronts while some others may be smooth enough to be measured in energy norm. In addition, we cannot expect
diﬀerentiability of solutions of PDEs with respect to just any parameter of that PDE. Therefore, the inﬂuence of one
component upon the others, and/or the impact of model modiﬁcations, when assessed via sensitivity analysis, is based
on only a very weak theoretical foundation. In this paper we discuss a few qualitative ideas for assessing the modeling
error.
The plan of the paper is as follows. We ﬁrst present the model of methane hydrates in which diﬀusion and
phase transitions dominate. We solve mass conservation equations and an energy balance in four variants which
˜ of a basic model M. Then we propose how to assess the global computational
represent various model modiﬁcations M
modeling error.
Last, we comment on the state of the art of methane hydrate modeling. The simulators such as STOMP-MH [9]
and TOUGH+Hydrate [10] have computational models based on ﬁnite volumes and state-of-the-art thermodynamics
and solver capabilities. On the other hand, recent research codes [11, 12] are concerned with important scenarios
of hydrate evolution. However, little is known about the error analysis and control, or about the impact of model
modiﬁcations in these implementations. This paper is a step in this direction, but the ideas have been applied only to
a simpliﬁed model. The signiﬁcant challenge will be to incorporate the model and grid adaptivity ideas proposed here
in a comprehensive fully implicit implementation.
2. Mathematical model for hydrate evolution, static temperature
Here we brieﬂy present a model for hydrate evolution in subsurface. We follow closely the standard notation
for multiphase, multicomponent ﬂow and transport as in [13, 14, 15]. A comprehensive model for hydrates such as
[9, 10, 11, 12] may include all the ﬁrst-order and many second- or third-order eﬀects relevant at various time scales of
interest. In this paper we consider only ﬁrst order eﬀects relevant at large time scales [1] such as diﬀusion and phase
transitions and account for temperature evolution, but ignore sedimentation rate. We note that the model in [11] does
not include latent heat while we were not able to identify all the necessary deﬁnitions of energy-related terms in [12].
We consider methane and other ﬂuids in a porous subsea sediment reservoir Ω ⊂ Rd , 1 ≤ d ≤ 3, an open bounded
domain. The reservoir is under the earth surface; its depth is denoted by D(x), x ∈ Ω, and its porosity and permeability
by φ, K, respectively. In this paper we assume φ = const, K = const.
2.1. Phases and components
In addition to methane M, the main components of the ﬂuids in the porespace are water W and salt S . These can
be present in one or more phases. In general, in [11, 12] one considers two mobile ﬂuid phases l, g (brine, gas) and an
immobile hydrate phase h (hydrate). Usually the pore space is mainly saturated with water phase with only a small

711

amount of methane gas present. The three phases l, g, h occupy together the pore space and their respective volume
fractions are denoted by saturations S p , p = l, g, h, with S p ≥ 0, and p S p = 1.
Usually one considers phase pressures of mobile phases Pl , Pg , and the capillary pressure relationship Pg − Pl =
Pc (S l ) given by Brooks-Corey relationships or van-Genuchten correlations [13]. The advective velocities are given
k
via a multiphase extension of Darcy’s law v p = −K μrpp (∇P p − ρ pG∇D(x)), p = l, g, where krp , μ p denote relative
permeability, viscosity, and density of phase p and G the gravity constant. In this paper we assume ρ p = const.
In this paper we assume that the water phase is distributed hydrostatically, i.e., the gradient of the potential in
Darcy’s law is zero and therefore vl = 0. In addition, we assume that the gas phase saturations are below their residual
amount i.e. gas phase is immobile due to krg ≡ 0 and vg = 0. In other words both phases are eﬀectively immobile.
Any mass transfer occurs by diﬀusion in liquid phase and by phase transition to gas and hydrate phases. In what
follows we also set P = Pl and ignore capillary pressure i.e. Pg = P.
To account for component diﬀusion and component distribution between phases and for phase transitions, we
discuss mass of each component. Mass fraction of component C in phase p is denoted by X pC , and we have X pC ≥ 0.
We have for each phase p, C X pC = 1, and speciﬁcally in this paper
XgM

2.2. Thermodynamics
The distribution of components between phases is governed by thermodynamics. In particular, one needs the
following quantities to determine phase behavior: i) the equilibrium (melting/dissociation) pressure for given T and
max
salinity PEQ = PEQ (T, XlS ), and ii) maximum solubility XlS
(P, T, XlS ) of methane M in liquid phase p = l. Such
data is available in the literature via various functional models related to an equation of state (EOS) approach, or via
lookup tables [2, 12, 16, 17].
2.3. Mass conservation equations
The general phase-summed mass conservation equation is
storageC + advectionC + di f f usionC = sourceC ,
where the individual terms vary with C = M, W, S . Dropping the advection terms we have
storage M

di f f usion M

∂
(φS g ρg + φS l ρl XlM + φS h ρh XhM ) − ∇ · (Dm φS l ρl ∇XlM )

(5)

=

0.

(6)

di f f usionS

∂
(φS l ρl XlS ) − ∇ · (D s φS l ρl ∇XlS )
∂t

These equations describe diﬀusive mass transfer of methane M and of salt S in liquid phase p = l; the deﬁnition of
diﬀusive ﬂuxes follows from Fick’s law.
Formally we can also write for the water component ∂t∂ (φS l ρl (1 − XlS − XlW )) = 0. Adding this equation to (6), (5),
in case of nontrivial advective ﬂuxes would yield an equation for the pressure. However, since the pressure is assumed
hydrostatic and advective ﬂuxes vanish, XlS and XlM can be found from (6)–(5), and the water equation is redundant.
If P, T are known, the system (5)–(6), when complemented with initial and boundary conditions, can be solved
numerically. To ﬁx the pressure, we assume hydrostatic pressure model P0 (x) linear with depth via hydrostatic gradient: Ptop = 8MPa, and lithostatic/hydrostatic gradient is 10.4MPa/km which gives bottom pressure at depth of 400m
of about 10MPa. Similarly, we assume a ﬁxed thermal gradient and an associated static linear temperature proﬁle
T 0 (x). with T top = 4oC and geothermal gradient 55oC/km which gives the bottom temp about 11oC, see example in
Figure 1.

Figure 1: Evolution of methane hydrates. Shown are proﬁles of temperature, pressure, gas and hydrate saturations, solubilities, and phase state, at
time step 1, 10, 100 (nondimensional). Phase state is 1 (L+H), 2 (L+H+G), 3 (L+G), 4 (L). The methane concentration N M is decreasing because
we let it escape it to the ocean at x = 400. This causes the dissociation of hydrate and the decrease in salinity; the hydrate/gas interface moves
down.

After discretization, the resulting algebraic system is solved for two primary variables which fully describe the
thermodynamic conditions in the model; see Gibbs rule [18, 13, 19]. The choice of primary variables u may be
dictated by convenience but it must be possible to compute all other variables from u. The choice which variables
are primary is tricky when phases appear/disappear in certain parts of Ω; this is a long-standing issue in reservoir
simulation.
In [14, 20, 15] variable switching is proposed. Here we follow another approach used in petroleum industry
[21, 22, 23]: we deﬁne concentrations NC which are the storage terms under ∂t∂ in (5) and use these as primary
unknowns. Concentrations are smoother than phase saturations but their use may require a local nonlinear solver
called ﬂash, see [23, 13].
An example of hydrate evolution similar to scenarios in [11] is shown in Figure 1.
2.4. Solving the coupled nonlinear system
Now consider the discretization of the equations (5)-(6). Both spatial and temporal grids are adaptive but are
assumed uniform in the presentation below. To discretize in space, we apply the cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerence method;
this method is conservative, equivalent to mixed ﬁnite elements on rectangular grids [24], and is amenable to adaptivity
[25]. Also, it can be easily extended to a more general model with advection. For time discretization, one can apply
either a fully implicit formulation or a sequential formulation. Either way, the most diﬃcult part of the model is
accounting for all the correct thermodynamics and phase transition behavior.
Fully implicit formulation has the advantage of being unconditionally stable while it requires a substantial computational eﬀort and may be overly diﬀusive; it is advocated for production-quality simulations of a comprehensive
model with second and third order eﬀects [9, 10]. In this paper we report on the results of a sequential formulation
which shows the ﬁrst order eﬀects quite well and can be naturally imbedded in our model adaptivity procedure. We
use a very small time step to practically eliminate the time discretization error, and to ensure stability.
For (5)-(6) combined with the static proﬁle of temperature, with the notation related to the spatial discretization
supressed, we solve the following system at time step tn+1

3. A model for methane hydrates with dynamic energy balance
Now we replace (9) by one of several variants of a dynamic energy balance equation; its importance is discussed
in [26, 27]. These various models replace (9) by the energy equation of the form FTn+1/2 (T hn+1 ) = 0, in several variants.
A general energy equation for multiphase multicomponent system has a structure similar to (5) with heat conduction terms en lieu of diﬀusive terms and convective ﬂuxes en lieu of advective ﬂuxes, now associated with the overall
mass ﬂux term F

in which H is the enthalpy [13, 18, 28]. We need now to make explicit the heat accumulation/capacity C(T ) and the
heat conductivity λ(T ) terms, as well as identify the latent heat eﬀects. The latter arise during the hydrate formation
and dissociation in a process similar to water-ice phase transition.
In the classical Stefan model [28] for water-ice phase transitions occuring at a temperature T eq , we have C(T ) =
λ1 , T < T EQ ,
C1 , T < T eq ,
+ LH(T − T eq ), and λ(T ) =

Figure 2: Temperature proﬁles for diﬀerent variants of energy equation. Static model uses (9). Dynamic, no latent heat model, uses (11) with
LH = 0. Dynamic, sink-type model, uses (11). Dynamic, Stefan-type model, uses L˜ H . Not shown is grid convergence of tempreatures in energy
norm which is global for models without latent heat, and local away from phase boundary for the models with latent heat.

H(T ) is not diﬀerentiable in a classical sense; its distributional derivative is a Dirac source concentrated along the
free boundary and the analysis is highly nontrivial; see [29, 28] for a few representative references. Appropriately,
numerical solution is delicate; the use of adaptive methods and various regularizations in particular with phase-ﬁeld
models or level-set methods have been considered e.g. in [30, 31, 32].
Consider the behavior of solutions to (10) when initially the region Ω is occupied by ice under T (x, 0) = T 0 <
T EQ . In a model driven by heat supplied from one of the boundaries, while the other boundary is kept at T 0 , the
free boundary between the regions occupied by water and ice moves in time and eventually assumes a stationary
proﬁle across which the temperature T is continuous but its gradient is not. The proﬁle of the dynamic solutions
T (x, t) depends on the magnitude of L. However, in the absence of mass ﬂuxes, the stationary solution T (x, ∞) :=
limt→∞ T (x, t) does not depend on L but only on the jump λ1 − λ2 in λ(T ). In other words, one can ﬁnd T (x, ∞)
with a model including latent heat or not; this suggests opportunities for model adaptivity if one is interested only in
long-term solutions.
An appropriate extension of Stefan-type model to multiple phases and components [13, 18] includes summation
over phases and phase enthalpies H p = C p T so that C(T ) = (1 − φ)ρRCR T + φ p=l,g,h S p ρ pC p T, λ(T ) = (1 −
φ)λR + φ p=l,g,h S p λ p . These deﬁnitions are reﬁned further to identify the latent heat of hydrate dissociation LH as the
diﬀerence of enthalpies Hh − Hl . We skip the details and consider the following deﬁnition of rate of change of C(T )

The mass conservation combined with (10) and (11) is our reference model M(u) = 0. We refer to it as the Sinktype model [33, 34], because the term LH ∂t∂ (φS h ρh ) plays a role of a heat sink term when moved to the right-hand side
of (10).

saturations are shown at the (nondimensional) time step tn = 10.
4. Adaptive modeling of Methane Hydrate
When considering adaptive modeling and grid reﬁnement, the ﬁrst concern is whether the convergence in discretization parameters can be indeed observed and in what norm it should be measured. Theory suggests that for
smooth solutions one can expect at least ﬁrst order convergence in L2 or even H1 norm. At the same time, non-smooth
components may not converge in norms stronger than L1 .
In our problem, an example of smooth and non-smooth variables is provided by the temperatures and the hydrate
saturations, see Figures 2, 3, respectively. The former are continuous and smooth except near the phase transition
boundaries, and the latter exhibit a sharp change at the boundary where the hydrate dissociates and forms. Therefore,
it is not possible to apply simple a-posteriori error estimates to both variables.
Now we focus on the modeling error and the combined computational error and provide an illustration of the ideas
given in Introduction applied to our complex coupled problem. We discuss the total pointwise error e˜ ch = (u − u˜ h )c
and the qualitative behavior of the grid error combined with the modeling error for the selected components c of u.
The exact value u is estimated from a very ﬁne grid solution (not shown), after we test the stability of solutions.
We consider the error(s) e˜ Th in the temperature T variable which is a smooth component of u, and e˜ Sh h in the hydrate
saturation S h , which is nonsmooth. The errors are shown for two grids: the coarse grid H and medium grid h, with
interpolation used as needed. The goal is to understand the behavior of error on the medium grid h by using the
inexpensive estimates of the error on the coarse grid.
In Figure 4 we show the pointwise error e˜ cH := ((u − uH ) + (uH − u˜ H ))c for both components which includes the
grid plus the modeling error on the coarse grid. We see that e˜ cH agrees well qualitatively with e˜ ch for both variables c =
T, S h .. However, the grid error is overpredicted signiﬁcantly when measured in the energy norm, or in L p , p = 1 norms,
for smooth and nonsmooth components, respectively. Therefore, we need an indicator for the grid error on medium
grid, and the modeling error on the coarse grid ηcHh := (u−uh )c S (h, H)+(uH −u˜ H )c . Here the scaling coeﬃcient S (h, H)
reﬂects the anticipated order of convergence; e.g., should equal Hh for a smooth component converging linearly. For a
nonsmooth variable, we use S (h, H) ≡ 1.
While these illustrations are only qualitative, we see that for a very crude modeling approximation (e.g. static
versus Sink model) the modeling error dominates and the total error can be assessed on a coarse grid. The more subtle
modeling error between the dynamic and Stefan models needs an indicator such as ηcHh . More analysis is needed and
some is underway.

5. Conclusions and future work
We have presented a grid-convergent computational model for evolution of methane hydrates in which we considered several variants of the energy balance equations. We have also illustrated and estimated the modeling error
associated with each variant, and demonstrated general agreement in the order of magnitude of the errors as well as in
their qualitative behavior.
More analysis is needed to understand the proper scaling of the modeling error in relation to the discretization error.
For the methane hydrate model, further analysis of the numerical error as well as deﬁnition of fully comprehensive
adaptivity case studies are needed; some results in this direction are underway.
Other opportunities for adaptivity of a complex model include i) the modiﬁcation of thermodynamics models, ii)
the use of kinetic versus equilibrium phase transition models, iii) the considerations of competition of advection and
diﬀusion at various time scales, and many others. These are subject of our current work.
