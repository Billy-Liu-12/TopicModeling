Abstract. The analysis of dynamics of semi-ﬂexible polymers, such as
DNA molecules, is an important multiscale problem with a wide range
of applications in science and bioengineering. In this contribution, we
show how accounting for internal viscosity in dumbbell-type models may
render physically plausible results with minimal computational cost. We
focus our attention on the cases of steady shear and extensional ﬂows
of polymeric solutions. First, the tensors with moments other than the
second order moment are approximated. Then, the nonlinear algebraic
equation for the second moment conformation tensor is solved. Finally,
substituting the resulting conformation tensor into the Kramers equation of Hookean spring force, the constitutive equations for the model
are obtained. The shear material properties are discussed in the context of diﬀerent internal viscosities and our computational results are
compared with the results of other methods applicable for high shear or
extensional rates.
Keywords: Polymeric ﬂuid; Dumbbell model; Internal viscosity.

Introduction

The dynamics of polymeric ﬂuids is an important multiple time scale problem, involving the quick speed of the small solvent molecules, fast movement of
atomic particles that constitute the polymers and slow orientation of the polymer deformation [1]. Brownian dynamic simulation is the technique taking into
account all the motions in the polymeric ﬂuids. Coarse-grained models are often
used in the analysis of the rheological properties of polymeric ﬂuids. From the
mesoscopic view, the fast movements of the atomic particles of the polymers are
neglected in order to relieve the complexity. In the investigation of the mathematical problems for the coarse-grained models, multiscale method is also an
eﬃcient technique to obtain the approximate solutions [2].
The simplest, albeit extremely useful in applications, model for polymer solutions is the Hookean dumbbell model proposed by Kuhn [3], where a polymer
molecule in dilute solution is represented by two beads connected by a spring

force. This mathematical simpliﬁcation has contributed a lot to the development of constitutive models for investigating properties of polymeric ﬂuids with
dumbbell-type models [1,4,5]. In order to obtain a better agreement with experimental results, a few additions have been incorporated into the standard
dumbbell model. Of particular importance for our further discussion are two of
them: ﬁnitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) property and internal viscosity of the spring. Taking into account these properties leads to a situation where
the governing equations of conformation tensors become nonlinear and the resulting problem has no closed form solution unless an appropriate approximation
is made.
Brownian dynamic simulations have been used widely in applications of the
FENE dumbbell model to the analysis of ﬂuids and semi-ﬂexible polymers. The
results obtained on the basis of such simulations are often more accurate compared to approximate theoretical methodologies discussed in [6,7,8]. Nevertheless, Brownian dynamic simulations are time consuming and do not render a
straightforward technique for the explanation of the underlying physical properties of ﬂuids and polymers. A consequence of this is intensive research eﬀorts in
developing semi-analytical methodologies which should be combined with computational experiments in order to shed further light on such properties. From
a mathematical point of view, these eﬀorts are reducible to the construction of
some closure forms for the equation written with respect to the conformation
tensor in such a way that the governing constitutive equations for the system
(after certain approximations) become analytically solvable. The main idea is
to apply an ensemble averaging methodology to non-second moment terms so
that closed form solutions could be obtained [2,9,10]. However, for the dumbbell
model with internal viscosity there is a forth moment tensor in the governing
equation which makes it diﬃcult to ﬁnd the closed form solutions. Therefore,
a numerical methodology should be developed to simulate the dynamics of the
polymeric system. In the context of rheological properties of complex ﬂuids, this
issue was previously discussed by a number of authors (e.g., [11,15]). Booij and
Wiechen [12] used a perturbation solution approach to calculate the ﬁrst order approximation of the internal viscosity parameter. More recently, based on
the Gaussian closure method, the second moment tensor and higher moment
tensors have been calculated by integration over the conformation distribution
space [13,14,15].
In this contribution, a new approximation scheme is proposed to solve the
governing equations analytically. The forth moment tensor is approximated by
an expression involving the second moment tensor in order to obtain a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. Based on the analytical solutions of such equations,
the material properties of the polymeric ﬂuids in steady-state shear ﬂows and extensional viscosities in extensional ﬂows are discussed. The phenomena of shear
thinning and attenuation of pressure drop have been found and the results have
been compared to the results obtained by Brownian dynamics simulations and
the Gaussian closure method in the context of high shear or extensional rates.
Our results can explain the phenomenon of shear thinning by introducing the

internal viscosity and obtaining better predictions compared to the traditional
technique.

The Governing Equations

For the polymers in a Newtonian solvent with viscosity ηs described with the
bead-spring-bead dumbbell model it is assumed that there is no interaction between the beads. Let us denote the viscous drag coeﬃcient due to the resistance
of the ﬂow by ζ. For the dumbbell model with internal viscosity (IV), the spring
˙
force is a function of the conﬁguration vector, Q, and conﬁguration velocity Q.
The force law in this case can be expressed as:
˙ = HQ + K
F Q, Q

where Q is the length of vector Q, H is the spring coeﬃcient of the dumbbell

where δ is a unit matrix, g = 2ε/(1 + 2ε), and ε is the relative internal viscosity.
Note that ε = K/2ζ and it can formally range from zero to inﬁnity. Furthermore,
for g = 0, equation (3) recovers the form of the diﬀusion equation for Hookean
dumbbells without IV.
The second moment conformation tensor Q ⊗ Q is of the most interest when
calculating the stress tensor. The governing equation for the conformation tensor
can be developed by multiplying the diﬀusion equation by the dyadic product

In the steady state ﬂow case, when all the time-dependent terms can be neglected, equation (8) becomes a nonlinear algebraic equation with respect to
Q ⊗ Q . In the next section, we will seek a closed form solution to this governing equation, followed by the material properties discussion in the case of steady

Based on equations (15) and (18), we calculate the material properties for
diﬀerent internal viscosities. The plots presented in Figure 1 demonstrate comparison results between our approximate solutions (AS), the results obtained
by Brownian dynamics simulations (BD), and the results obtained with the
Gaussian closure technique (GC) [15]. The internal viscosity was chosen as ε = 1.
In Figure 1, the solid lines represent our algebraic solutions to the governing
equations for the material coeﬃcients, the dots represent the data obtained by
Brownian dynamics simulations, and the dot-dash lines represent the results
obtained by the Gaussian closure method. For both viscosity and ﬁrst-normal
stress coeﬃcients, our algebraic solutions exhibit the plateau values appearing
also in the case of Brownian dynamics simulations. Observe that compared to the
Gaussian closure method, our methodology has a wider range of applicability.

Conclusions

In this contribution, we developed a set of approximate semi-analytical solutions
for the dumbbell model with IV without integration of the Gaussian distribution. Our concise equations can predict the material coeﬃcients of polymeric
ﬂuid well, qualitatively and also quantitatively. The shear thinning phenomena
are described well with the new developed model deduced from the dumbbell
model with internal viscosity. The eﬀect of internal viscosity in the extensional
ﬂow case has also been demonstrated. By comparing our computational results
with Brownian dynamic simulations and the Gaussian closure methodology, we
demonstrated the eﬃciency of the proposed approximate technique for a wider
range of high shear or extensional ﬂow rates.
