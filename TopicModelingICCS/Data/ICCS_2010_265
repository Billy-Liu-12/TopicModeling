Abstract
Little is known on how diﬀerent levels of population heterogeneity and diﬀerent patterns of human mobility
would aﬀect the course of an epidemic in terms of timing and impact. By employing a large-scale spatially-explicit
individual-based model, based on a highly detailed model of the European populations and on a carefully analysis of
air and railway transportation data, we provide quantitative measures of their eﬀects at European level. Our results
show that Europe must prepare to face a fast diﬀusion of an epidemic, mostly because of the early importation of
the ﬁrst cases from abroad and the synchronization of the local epidemics, determined by the high mobility of the
European population. We found that the cumulative attack rate is positively correlated with the average households
size and the fraction of students in the population, and negatively correlated with the fraction of inactive population.
These results have potentially strong implications in terms of mitigation and control, and suggest that the eﬀectiveness
of interventions as antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, schools closure and travel restrictions should be evaluated on
a country basis.

1. Introduction
The spread of an infectious disease epidemic is driven by the interplay of two factors: the transmissibility of
the pathogen responsible for the infection and the characteristics of the host population. When the role of host is
played by a human population, predicting the spread of an epidemic is a tough problem due the complexity of modern
human societies. It is well established that the spatial structure of the population has an impact on the diﬀusion of
an epidemic: measles waves in England and Wales, spreading from large cities to small towns, are determined by
the spatial hierarchy of the host population structure [1], and the spatial distribution of farms inﬂuences the regional
variability of foot-and-mouth outbreaks in United Kingdom [2]. The heterogeneity of the population itself can play
an important role in the spread of an epidemic [3]. It is also well known that human mobility patterns aﬀect the
spatiotemporal dynamics of an epidemic: the role played by the airline transportation network has been analyzed in
[4], and it has been shown that the high degree of predictability of the worldwide spread of infectious diseases is
caused by the strong heterogeneity of the transport network [5].

Large-scale individual-based spatially explicit transmission models of infectious diseases [6] have become a relevant tool to evaluate intervention options for containing [7, 8] or mitigating [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] a new inﬂuenza
pandemic. A review is given in [16]. Because of their complexity, these models have been developed only at country
level, including also some European countries [10, 12].
However, Europe has never been analyzed as a whole and thus it is still uncertain how a new pandemic inﬂuenza
could spread in Europe. Europe comprises countries characterized by completely diﬀerent social and economical
backgrounds that result in diﬀerent levels of population heterogeneity, in terms of both sociodemograpic structure and
mobility. In particular, it is still unclear how diﬀerences in the sociodemographic structure, which result in diﬀerent
levels of population heterogeneity, and diﬀerent patterns of human mobility can aﬀect the spatiotemporal spread of an
epidemic. Here we provide quantitative measures of their eﬀects on the impact and the timing of a highly transmissible
inﬂuenza pandemic at European level.
2. Results
2.1. Population heterogeneity
By analyzing data on the sociodemographic structure of 37 European countries (see Fig. 1a) provided by the
Statistical Oﬃce of the European Communities (Eurostat) and integrated with data provided by the National Statistical
Oﬃces for countries not covered by Eurostat, we found that the frequencies of household type and size (Fig. 1b-c),
the age structure (Fig. 1e), the schools size (Fig. 1d), the rates of school attendance and employment by age (Fig. 1f)
are highly variable across Europe. The age structure of countries like Ireland, which is one the youngest European
countries (with 31% of the population aged less or equal than 20 years), diﬀers drastically from that of countries like
Germany and Italy (where only 22% and 20.5% of the population is aged less or equal than 20 years, respectively),
which are characterized by very low fertility rates [17]. This results in largely diﬀerent frequencies of household type
and size. The fraction of households with children ranges from 0.3 in Denmark to 0.6 in Sweden and the average
household size ranges from 2.1 in Denmark to 3 in Cyprus. By restricting our attention to the households with
children, a large variability in the number of children per household is also observable, with countries as Ireland and
Cyprus, where households have several children, opposite to countries like Germany and Bulgaria. We have also
observed a large diﬀerence in terms of employment rates in the population aged more than 15 years (the legal working
age in Europe is 15 or 16, with some exceptions): the fraction of workers ranges from 0.39 in Bulgaria to 0.67 in
Lichtenstein. The fraction of students in the population aged more than 15 years ranges from 0.04 in Denmark to
0.12 in Cyprus. According to the PIRLS 2001 and PISA 2000 and 2003 international surveys, as elaborated in [18],
the average size of primary schools ranges from 200 to 750 and the average size of secondary schools ranges from
270 to 1000. We used an independent data set providing information on all the Italian schools to validate the surveys
data. Data concerning workplaces in Italy and United Kingdom do not highlight signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the size of
workplaces. We used the above described sociodemographic data to generate a highly detailed synthetic population of
individuals, explicitly grouped in households, schools and workplaces, for simulating the populations in the diﬀerent
countries of the study area. Since it is reasonable to assume that the epidemiological characteristics of the virus do
not vary among the European countries, we should expect that the high variability in the sociodemographic structure
of the European countries results in a high variability in the impact of an inﬂuenza pandemic in the diﬀerent European
countries. This is the ﬁrst key issue we want to address. Details on the analysis of the European sociodemographic
structure are given in [19].
2.2. Human mobility
We analyzed air and railway transportation data as provided by Eurostat. We found that in the 2007 more than
360 millions passengers have taken international trips across EU27 (see Fig. 1a), 323 millions of whom by airplane
and 37 millions by train. In the same year, more than 135 millions passengers have entered EU27 from countries
outside EU27. The great majority of these travels are from and to the western part of Europe (see Fig. 2a-b), namely
United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain (about the 85% of the travels are from and to these countries).
The probability density function of travel distances is shown in Fig. 2c. As shown in [21, 22], international travel
ﬂows are related to economic factors. By considering only the travels across EU27, we found that the ﬂow from
country i to country j can be explained by a gravity model depending on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product: it is an

two countries. τ f and τt tune the dependence of dispersal on donor and recipient sizes and ρ tunes the dependence
on the distance, θ is a proportionality constant. To show this, we generated a synthetic population of travelers taking
travels according to a gravity model whose masses are given by the normalized GPDs (model A), by the population
sizes, as in [23] (model B) and, ﬁnally, taking travels by choosing a random destination (model C). We found that
model A explains the origin-destination matrix (Fig. 2d) and the distance distribution (Fig. 2e) better than models
B and C. This considered, we used model A for simulating long-distance travels across the study area. As for the
internal commuting, i.e. daily trips to school and workplace, we adopted the following procedure. First, schools and
workplaces of the proper size were spatially-distributed proportionally to the population. Afterward, students and
workers were randomly assigned to a school or workplace, in such a way that the resulting distance to school/work
distribution complies with a truncated power-law distribution (see Fig. 2f), as proposed in [20] for the radius of
gyration of mobile phone users, extending the precursor work presented in [24] on the circulation of bank notes in the
United States of America. Commuting ﬂows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline
ﬂows [25]. To what extent the observed mobility patterns and their inhomogeneity across the European countries
aﬀect the spread of a new inﬂuenza pandemic in Europe is the second key issue we want to address. Details on the
analysis of human mobility patterns are given in [19].

In the model, students are assumed to attend schools no more than 100Km from home. This results in a change in the slope of the probability curve
(blue circle).

2.3. Spatiotemporal spread of a pandemic inﬂuenza in Europe
The transmission rates, deﬁned as the product of the contacts rate times the probability of transmitting the infection, of a new inﬂuenza pandemic are unknown. By looking at past pandemics, we can only make assumptions
on its transmissibility potential, which can be summarized by the reproductive number R0 (essentially, the number
of secondary infections that result from a single infectious individual in a fully susceptible population [26]). The
investigated value is R0 = 2. Moreover, according to [10], the model is parametrized so that in the United Kingdom
30% of transmission occurs in households, 37% in schools and workplaces and 33% in the general community. Since
the contact rates and, consequently, the reproductive number are determined by the sociodemographic structure of
the population we are somehow setting the probability of transmitting the infection in the diﬀerent social contexts.
After having parametrized the model in the United Kingdom, the same transmission rates are assumed in the rest of
the study area. In what follows, when not diﬀerently stated, we are assuming R0 = 2 (as discussed, it means R0 = 2
in the United Kingdom). We assume that the latent period is 1.5days and the infectious period is 2days (however
we performed a sensitivity analysis for values of this epidemiological parameter in the range 1.5 - 3days). Infected
individuals are assumed to have a probability 0.5 of developing clinical symptoms.
We found that the probability of importing the ﬁrst case is higher in the western countries (the ﬁrst case is imported
in United Kingdom or Germany in almost 50% of simulations, see Fig. 3a). The distributions of the timing of the

in Ireland and Bulgaria respectively. These two countries are among those where the impact of the epidemic is expected to be the highest and
the lowest respectively. (e) Time sequence (in days) of a simulated epidemic. A single simulation with ﬁrst European case in United Kingdom is

ﬁrst case diﬀer largely from country to country (see Fig. 3b): in average, the ﬁrst case occurs 44 and 79 days after
the ﬁrst world case in the United Kingdom and Principality of Monaco respectively. By ignoring the less populous
countries, a west-east gradient is clearly observable. The variability in the peak day in the diﬀerent countries (see
Fig. 3c) is less remarkable (in average it ranges from 106 days in Cyprus to 122 in Romania) since long-distance
travels tend to synchronize the national epidemics and these are much faster in the less populous countries. In general,
we have observed that the high mobility inside the countries (internal commuting) and the long-distance travels tend
to synchronize, thus fastening, the epidemic. The average peak day in a country is positively correlated with the
longitude of the country (Spearman test, ρ = 0.55, p = 0.0003), as conﬁrmed by the clear spatial trend observable in
the time sequence of the simulated epidemic shown in Fig. 3e. This ﬁnding is supported by the results presented in
[27], where a spatial analysis revealed a signiﬁcant west-east pattern in the timing of peak inﬂuenza activity across
Europe for the eight winters since 1999-2000. The average peak day in a country is negatively correlated with the
yearly number of passengers entering the country from other countries in the study area (Spearman test, ρ = −0.59,
p = 0.001), supporting the hypothesis that the observed pattern of epidemic spread is related to patterns of human
movement. The expected pattern of spread in Europe is shown in Fig. 3d. The epidemic peaks some 110 days after
the ﬁrst world case and the epidemic lasts about 3 months. We remark that Fig. 3d reports the expected number of
new cases in time. Since the epidemics are not synchronized in time, the actual peak incidence will be much higher
than the value corresponding to the peak day reported in the ﬁgure (it will be closer to the upper 95% conﬁdence limit,
see also Fig. 4b).
In average, the cumulative attack rate in the diﬀerent countries ranges from 31.2% in Bulgaria to 37.8% in Cyprus
(see Fig. 4a). By looking at the study area as a whole, the average cumulative attack rate is 33.7%. Among the most
popolous countries, the cumulative attack rate is expected to be 31.7% in Germany, 33.4% in the United Kingdom,
33.5% in Italy, 34.5% in France and 35.5% in Spain. It is worth noticing that the value obtained for the United
Kingdom is very similar to that obtained in [10]. The standard deviations of the distributions of the national cumulative
attack rates are very small, but for the less populous countries. The average cumulative attack rate in a country is

positively correlated with the average household size (Spearman test, ρ = 0.77, p < 0.0001) (see Fig.4c) and with
the fraction of students in the population (Spearman test, ρ = 0.77, p < 0.0001), and negatively correlated with
the fraction of inactive individuals in the population (Spearman test, ρ = −0.38, p = 0.02) (see Fig. 4f). It is worth
noticing that a simple linear regression model whose independent variables are the average household size, the fraction
of students and the fraction of inactive individuals in the population predicts very well the average cumulative attack
rate in the diﬀerent countries (coeﬃcient of determination R2 = 0.985, root mean square error RMSE=0.17). The
peak daily attack rate in the diﬀerent countries is also highly variable. It ranges from 1.5% in Bulgaria to 2.3% in
Cyprus (see Fig. 4b). Since the national epidemics are not synchronized, the average peak daily attack rate of the
whole study is similar to the value observed in Bulgaria, namely 1.5%. In the United Kingdom we obtained a lower
peak daily attack rate (1.8%) with respect to the 2.1% as reported in [10]. This is due to diﬀerent modeling choices
for the infective period. We assume an exponential distribution for both latent and infectious period (as in classical
mathematical models of infectious diseases) and infectiousness is assumed to be constant during the infectious period
(2 days). In [10] individuals transmit more at the very beginning of the infectious period, giving rise to faster simulated
epidemics and to higher peak daily attack rates. These diﬀerent modeling choices can aﬀect the evaluation of some
containment strategies (e.g. antiviral treatment) and can lead to diﬀerences in the timing of the simulated epidemics
but do not aﬀect the results presented in this work. The cumulative attack rate does not depend on the infectious period.
Values of peak day and peak daily attack rate in the United Kingdom similar to that reported in [10] were obtained by

assuming an infectious period of 1.5days. We found that the peak daily attack rate in a country is positively correlated
with the average household size (Spearman test, ρ = 0.72, p < 0.0001) and with the fraction of students in the total
population (Spearman test, ρ = 0.79, p < 0.0001), and slightly negatively correlated with the fraction of inactive
individuals in the total population (Spearman test, ρ = −0.31, p = 0.06). Moreover, it is negatively correlated with
the number of inhabitants (Spearman test, ρ = −0.51, p = 0.001) since the national epidemics tend to be less spatially
synchronized in the larger countries. It is also relevant to analyze where transmission occurs. We found that the
transmission in households in the diﬀerent countries ranges from 28.6% in Danemark to 34.8% in Croatia (see Fig.
4d) and that the fraction of the population contracting the infection in foreign countries ranges from 0.02% in Slovakia
to 0.57% in Germany (see Fig. 4e). These last results suggest that the eﬃcacy of some targeted interventions, e.g.
post-exposure prophylactic antiviral treatment [10, 12] and travel restrictions [28], could be largely diﬀerent from
country to country.
3. Methods
We developed an individual-based epidemic simulation model that accounts, at country level, for explicit transmission in households, schools, workplaces (where homogeneous mixing is assumed) and in the general population
(where the force of infection is assumed to depend explicitly on the distance). The epidemic can spread from one
country to another through cross-borders diﬀusion and because of long distance travels. The infection is continuously sustained in the study area by importation of cases from countries outside Europe. Sociodemographic data
were used to generate a highly detailed synthetic population of individuals, explicitly grouped in households, schools
and workplaces, for simulating the populations in the diﬀerent countries of the study area. Data on air and railway
transportation data were used to simulate long-distance travels across the countries of the study area and to simulate
importation of cases. Details are given in [19].
4. Conclusions
Reliable data on the proportion of transmission in social contexts, crucial to the disease transmission, as prisons,
leisure places, public transportation systems, hospitals are not available, though some research works are contributing
to ﬁll the gap [29, 30]. Spontaneous behavioral changes in the population, as a protective response to a (possibly
lethal) epidemic, could aﬀect the spread of the epidemic [31], as well as the imminent school closure in the Summer
period. Despite these limitations, our results clearly show that, once the infection will be well established in Europe,
European countries have to be prepared to face a fast spread of the epidemic because of the high mobility of the
population, resulting in an early importation of the ﬁrst cases from abroad and in a high synchronization of the local
epidemics. Moreover, the number of imported and secondary cases in the initial phase of the epidemic is much larger
in the Western side of Europe. The impact of the epidemic is diﬀerent among the European countries. Speciﬁcally,
countries as Ireland would have to face more severe epidemic than countries as Germany and Bulgaria because of
their sociodemograpic structure, characterized by large household groups and by a large fraction of students in the
population. Our results are supported by the ﬁndings presented in [29], where the authors analyzed social contacts
and mixing patterns in eight European countries. Speciﬁcally, they found that living in a larger household size was
associated with higher number of reported contacts. Moreover, they found that the dominant feature of the contact
matrix data is the strong diagonal element: individuals in all age groups tend to mix assortatively (i.e., preferentially
with others of similar age) and this pattern is most pronounced in those aged 5-24 years, i.e. the scholar age. They also
found that 58% of all reported contacts occur at home, at work, or at school. This results supports our assumption on
the proportion of transmission in the diﬀerent social contexts (in the model, 67% of transmission occurs in households,
schools and workplaces, at least in the United Kingdom). These results should have to be take into account for
planning strategies for mitigating future pandemics.
