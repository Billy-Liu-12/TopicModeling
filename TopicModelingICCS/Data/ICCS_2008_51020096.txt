Abstract. We give a method to generate polynomial approximations
to constant mean curvature surfaces with prescribed boundary. We address this problem by ﬁnding triangular B´ezier extremals of the CMCfunctional among all polynomial surfaces with a prescribed boundary.
Moreover, we analyze the C 1 problem, we give a procedure to obtain
solutions once the tangent planes for the boundary curves are also given.

Introduction

Surfaces with constant mean curvature (CMC-surfaces) are the mathematical
abstraction of physical soap ﬁlms and soap bubbles, and can be seen as the
critical points of area for those variations that left the enclosed volume invariable. The study of these surfaces is actually relevant since there is a wide range
of practical applications involving surface curvatures, ranging from rendering
problems to real settings in automotive industry as measurement and calibration problems, for instance.
In general, the characterization of “area minimizing under volume constraint”
is no longer true from a global point of view, since they could have self-intersections and extend to inﬁnity. But locally, every small neighborhood of a point
is still area minimizing while ﬁxing the volume which is enclosed by the cone
deﬁned by the neighborhood’s boundary and the origin.
An exhaustive discussion of the existence of surfaces of prescribed constant
mean curvature spanning a Jordan curve in R3 can be found in [2]. Given H ∈ R

We will give a method to generate B´ezier extremals of DH , for prescribed
boundary curves and constant mean curvature. Our method lets to obtain approximations to CMC-surfaces, since we have considered the problem of minimizing this functional restricted to the space of polynomials.
Moreover, we will consider the C 1 problem, that is, we give a way to generate
a polynomial approximation to CMC-surface once the boundary curves and the
tangent planes along them have been prescribed.

Existence of Triangular B´
ezier Surfaces of Prescribed
Constant Mean Curvature

Here, we are not working with parametrizations, we are working instead with
triangular control nets. So, our aim is to ﬁnd the minimum of the real function
→
→
x P ), −
x P being the triangular B´ezier patch associated to the control
P → DH (−
net P.
The Dirichlet functional, D, has a minimum in the B´ezier case due to the
following facts:
3(n−1)(n−2)
2
,
First, it can be considered as a continuous real function deﬁned on R

interior
control
points
which
belong
to
R
.
since there are (n−1)(n−2)
2
Second, the functional is bounded from below.
Third, the inﬁma is attained: when looking for a minimum, we can restrict
this function to a suitable compact subset.
→
On the other hand, the function assigning the value V (−
x P ) to each control
net, P, with ﬁxed boundary control points, has no global minimum. If that
minimum existed, since spatial translations do not aﬀect the curvature of the
surface, we could suppose that the origin is located far enough away from the
surface so that the control net is enclosed in a half-space passing through the
origin. Let us move an interior control point, PI0 , toward the origin. Then, a well→
known property of B´ezier surfaces states that all the points of −
x (u, v) change in
n
a parallel direction with intensity BI0 (u, v) . Then, since the new cone segment
is totally included in the initial one, its volume decreases.
→
As we said, the function, P → D(−
x P ), for control nets with ﬁxed boundary
→
always has a minimum and, as we have just seen, the function P → V (−
x P ), never
has a minimum. Therefore, by using the constant H to balance both functions
→
x P ), will have a minimum only for
we can say that the function, P → DH (−
H ∈ [a, −a] for some constant a ∈ R. It should be noted that when H = 0, DH
is reduced to the Dirichlet functional, D, and then there is a minimum, whereas
when H is too big, the main term in DH is V , and therefore the minimum does
not exist.
The value of a depends on the boundary control points and the symmetry of
the interval, [a, −a], is a consequence of the fact that reversing the orientation of a
surface means a change in the sign of the mean curvature. A detailed explanation

about the existence conditions of CMC-surfaces suited to a boundary and this
dependency can be found in [2].

The CMC-Functional B´

(1)

Expression (1) is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional DH . Moreover,
an isothermal patch satisﬁes the PDE in (1) if and only if it is an extremal of
DH . In [1], it was proved that an extremal of the Dirichlet functional among
all B´ezier triangular surfaces with a prescribed boundary always exists and it
is the solution of a linear system. Now we ﬁnd two qualitative diﬀerences, the
existence of the extremal of DH can only be ensured with certainty when |H| ≤ a,
for a certain constant, a, depending on the boundary conﬁguration, and they are
computed as solutions of a quadratic system. Moreover, since the Euler-Lagrange
equation of the functional DH , in Equation (1), is not linear we cannot determine
a B´ezier solution as a solution of a linear system of equations in terms of the
control points.
Here we will give an expression of the CMC-functional in terms of the control
points of a triangular B´ezier surface, which implies that the restriction of the
functional to the B´ezier case can be seen as a function instead of as a functional.
The following two results will simplify the way to obtain the formula in terms
of control points of the functional DH .
→
Proposition 2. The Dirichlet functional, D(−
x ), of a triangular B´ezier surface,
→
−
x , associated to the control net, P = {PI }|I|=n , can be expressed in terms of
the control points, PI = (x1I , x2I , x3I ), with |I| = |{I 1 , I 2 , I 3 }| = n by the formula

to compute the coeﬃcients CI0 I1 I2 we will compute its third derivative.

Now we must compute the derivative with respect to a second coordinate, x2I1 ,

We have just seen in Proposition 4 that the CMC-functional, is a function of
the control points, so let us now compute its gradient with respect to the coordinates of an arbitrary control point. This will let us to give a characterization
of the control net of the triangular B´ezier extremals of DH , which are B´ezier
approximations to CMC-surfaces.

Now we can characterize the triangular control net of an extremal of the CMCfunctional among all triangular B´ezier patches constrained by a given boundary.

we compute solutions to a restricted problem, that is, we ﬁnd extremals of the

Proof. We simply compute the gradient of the CMC-functional with respect to
an arbitrary control point.
The boundary curves of our example in Fig. 1 describe an approximation to
a circle. Therefore we obtain approximations to spheres. In Fig. 1 top, we have
asked the interior control points to fulﬁll a symmetry condition:

and we show three diﬀerent approximations to CMC-surfaces.
The three surfaces at the bottom are obtained as a solution of the system of
quadratic equations described in Equation (11). Here we don’t ask for any kind
of symmetry.

Fig. 1. These surfaces are approximations to CMC-surfaces with curvatures H = −1.5,
H = −1 and H = −0.5 respectively

In Fig. 2 we present two more examples. The boundary curves in the ﬁrst are
built in such a way that any associated patch would be isothermal at the corner
points and in the bottom surfaces in Fig. 2 the boundaries are approximations
to three circular arcs, and therefore our results look like pieces of a sphere.
The resulting plots are pleasant and moreover they can be continuously deformed by the parameter H, thus allowing the designer to choose of the shape
which best ﬁts the objective. We maintain the good shapes we got with the
Dirichlet results in [1], but now the choice of the curvature gives the designer
another degree of freedom, although the surfaces are obtained as a solution of a
quadratic system of the control points.

The C 1 Problem

In this section we will consider the prescription of not only the boundary but
also the tangent planes along the boundary curves, the C 1 problem. Now, the
boundary and the next to the boundary control points are ﬁxed, but again the
extremals of the CMC-functional, where the other interior control points are
considered as variables, can be computed.
Here we show an example. We prescribe the border control points along a
planar equilateral triangle and three more lines of control points as it is shown
in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. The border control points and their neighboring lines of control points are
prescribed

The following ﬁgures show approximations to CMC-surfaces obtained as a
solution of the quadratic system of the control points in Equation (11), but now
for all |I0 = (I01 , I02 , I03 )| = n with I01 , I02 , I03 > 1. The free points are the interior
control points outside the boundary and its next line of control points.

Conclusions

An isothermal patch has constant mean curvature H if and only if it is an
extremal of the functional
→
→
→
DH (−
x ) = D(−
x ) + 2HV (−
x ).
We have generated approximations to CMC-surfaces, since we have considered
the problem of minimizing this functional restricted to the space of polynomials. We have obtained an expression of DH in terms of the control points of a
triangular B´ezier surface. After that, we deduced the condition that a triangular
control net must fulﬁll in order to be an extremal of DH among all B´ezier triangles with a prescribed boundary. This characterization of the B´ezier extremals
of DH allowed us to compute them as a solution of a quadratic system of the
control points. The surfaces that are obtained have regular shapes and have the
advantage of allowing prescription of the desired curvature in addition to the
boundary. This makes it possible to ensure, for a given boundary, the existence
of a family of polynomial approximations to CMC-surfaces with this boundary
and curvatures within a particular interval. Therefore, the prescription of the
curvature in this method can be seen as another degree of freedom in comparison with the Dirichlet surface generation method in [1].
Finally, in the last section, we consider the C 1 problem, that is, once the
boundary curves and the tangent planes along them have been prescribed we
give a way to generate a polynomial approximation to CMC-surface associated
to this initial information.
