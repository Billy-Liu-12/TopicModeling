Abstract
In 2009, the authors implemented the linear-scaling divide-and-conquer (DC) methods into the GAMESS quantum chemistry
package. This program enabled fast energy calculations of closed-shell large molecules with high accuracy in Hartree-Fock (HF),
density functional theory, and post-HF levels of theory. After the first implementation, we extended the applicability of the DC
scheme into several directions. In this Paper, we summarized recent and future developments in the DC code in GAMESS,
namely, the energy gradient methods and open-shell treatments.

Keywords: divide-and-conquer method; self-consistent field calculation; open-shell system; electron correlation; energy gradient

1. Introduction
Since 1980s, many types of accelerating techniques for ab initio electronic structure calculations have been
developed to treat large molecules [1,2]. In the Hartree–Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
there are two obstacles to the application to large systems: the construction and the diagonalization of the Fock
matrix. A number of methods accelerating Fock construction have been proposed and implemented into many
quantum chemistry programs. For accelerating the step of Fock diagonalization, Yang and Lee [3] firstly proposed
the divide-and-conquer (DC) method. Recently, the authors have developed the DC code that can treat HF exchange
interaction [4,5] and extended the scheme into the post-HF electron correlation calculations [6–9] by applying the
energy density analysis (EDA) [10]. The program of the DC method became available in a part of GAMESS
package [11,12] from 2009 [13]. The DC-based linear-scaling electronic structure methods are summarized in the
review article [14].
After the first implementation, we have extended the DC method to various directions. In this Paper, we present
two of these recent developments, namely, the open-shell treatment using unrestricted molecular orbitals (MOs)

[15,16] and a novel energy gradient expression for DC-HF and DC-DFT [17].
2. Extension of DC method

2.1. Open-shell treatment
In the DC method, the system under consideration is spatially divided into disjoint subsystems, called the central
region, and the density of the subsystem is constructed from the subsystem MOs. To improve the description of the
subsystem density, atoms adjacent to the central region, called the buffer region, are taken into consideration when
constructing subsystem MOs. In open-shell calculations using unrestricted MOs, up- and down-spin MOs are
determined separately. Subsystem V-spin MOs are obtained by solving the following local Pople–Nesbet equations:
FVD CVD
q

H qVD SD CVD
q .

(1)

Here, Cq and Hq are the subsystem MO coefficient vector and energy, respectively. SD and FVD represent local
overlap and V-spin Fock matrices for subsystem D that are the submatrices of the entire overlap and Fock matrices.
The density matrix of the subsystem D, PD, is constructed from subsystem MOs as:
PPQVD

with Fermi function fE (x) = [1 + exp(–Ex)]–1, V-spin Fermi level H FV , and the partition matrix represented by

Each V-spin Fermi level H FV is determined by the constraint for keeping the number of V-spin electrons. The density
matrix of the entire system, PDC, is obtained by summing up subsystem contributions as
PPQVD .

(4)

The self-consitent field (SCF) iterations are carried out until both up- and down-spin density matrices converge.
There, Fock matrix and the total energy are calculated by using the density matrices in the standard manner.
We further develop DC-based unrestricted second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (DC-UMP2) code [17],
which is the straightforward extension of the DC-based correlation method for closed-shell systems [6]. In the DCUMP2 method, the total correlation energy is evaluated by summing up correlation energies of the subsystems:

where S(D) represents the set of basis functions in the subsystem D.
This procedure is applicable to the DFT calculations with the double-hybrid exchange-correlation functional, e.g.,
B2PLYP [18]. In B2PLYP calculations, the MP2-type correlation energy expression is mixed to the Lee–Yang–Parr
(LYP) correlation functional [19], as well as the HF exchange term mixed to the Becke 88 (B88) exchange
functional [20]. The energy expression for the B2PLYP functional is then given by:
Exc

(1  ax ) ExB88  ax ExHF  (1  ac ) EcLYP  ac 'EMP2 ,

(8)

with two parameters, of which the practical values are given by Grimme [18] as ax = 0.53 and ac = 0.27.
The present method was demonstrated by the illustrative application to the oligoacene test system, C4n+2H2n+4,
shown in Fig. 1. In DC calculations, we adopted C4H2 (or C6H2 for the center, C4H4 for the edges) group depicted in
Fig. 1 as a central region and treated two adjacent C4H2 (or C6H2 or C4H4) units as corresponding MP2 buffer region.
The SCF calculations were performed in the standard manner, without using the DC scheme. Fig. 2 shows the
singlet-triplet energy gap (Etriplet – Esinglet) calculated by the UHF and DC-UB2PLYP methods with 6-31G** basis
set [21]. The experimental values are also shown for n = 3 and 5. Although the experimental singlet-triplet gap
decreases as the system enlarges, the UHF method exhibits a completely opposite behavior. This tendency was fairly
improved by taking the MP2-type correlation expression into account by using the DC-UB2PLYP method.

2.2. Analytical gradient method
The second topic is about the energy gradient method, which is required for the geometry optimizations and
molecular dynamics simulations. The energy gradient expression for the DC-HF method was previously proposed

We here emphasize that Eq. (9) is only a DC-like approximation of the standard HF energy gradient. The proper
starting point of the DC-HF energy gradient is the direct differentiation of the DC-HF energy. In this point of view,
we have proposed a novel expression for the DC-HF energy gradient as [17]:

(12)

The superscript represents the submatrix with L(D) being the set of basis functions in the central or buffer region of
the subsystem D.
By numerical assessments of the DC-HF energy gradient in the geometry optimization, it was confirmed that the
present method [Eq. (11)] reproduces the structures obtained by the standard HF better than the YL method [Eq. (9)]
does [17]. We further tested the method in the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of a 50 water
cluster system at HF/6-31G level of theory with the NVE ensemble. In DC calculations, we adopted one water
molecule as a central region and treated the union of the spherical regions centered at the atoms in the central region
with radius rb as corresponding buffer region. Time propagation was performed by the velocity Verlet method with
the time step of 0.5 fs. Fig. 3 shows the time evolution of the total energy, which should be kept constant with the
NVE ensemble. The energy fluctuation decreases as the adopted buffer size becomes large, and it becomes 0.25
mHartree for rb = 7 Å in this simulation, which is quite close to 0.24 mHartree for the conventional calculation. The
energy variations of the present method are 3.4 and 0.64 mHartree for rb = 5 and 6 Å that are smaller than those of
the YL method, being 5.0 and 0.89 mHartree, respectively.

3. Summary
The capability of the present DC code in GAMESS program package is summarized in Table 1. In addition to the
energy and gradient calculations listed in Table 1, frequency-dependent polarizability obtained by the coupled
perturbed equations is available in HF/DFT level of theory [24]. Furthermore, the DC energy is also applicable to
the static (hyper)polarizability calculations with the finite electric field method [25]. The acceleration of the SCF
convergence has been examined by means of direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) [4] and fractional
occupation number (FON) [26] techniques. The DC-DIIS and DC-FON are available in the latest version of the
GAMESS package.
We hope that the present implementation is sufficiently valuable for the practical calculations of functional
materials. However, we are continuously developing the fundamental theory and corresponding program code to
improve the computational feasibility. The two-level hierarchical parallelization scheme [27] is being investigated in
order to making possible DC-MP2 calculations in massively parallel computers such as upcoming next-generation
supercomputer “K”.
