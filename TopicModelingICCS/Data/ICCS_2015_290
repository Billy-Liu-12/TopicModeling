Abstract
In this work, we present a numerical treatment for the model of two-phase ﬂow in porous
media including speciﬁc interfacial area. For numerical discretization we use the cell-centered
ﬁnite diﬀerence (CCFD) method based on the shifting-matrices method which can reduce the
time-consuming operations. A new iterative implicit algorithm has been developed to solve the
problem under consideration. All advection and advection-like terms that appear in saturation
equation and interfacial area equation are treated using upwind schemes. Selected simulation
results such as pc − Sw − awn surface, capillary pressure, saturation and speciﬁc interfacial area
with various values of model parameters have been introduced. The simulation results show a
good agreement with those in the literature using either pore network modeling or Darcy scale
modeling.

Introduction

The model of ﬂow and transport in porous media, Darcy’s law, was originally proposed empirically for one-dimensional isothermal ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid in a rigid, homogeneous
and isotropic porous medium. The extended Darcy’s Law is used for highly complex situations
like non-isothermal, multiphase and multicomponent ﬂow and transport, without introducing
any additional driving forces. The resisting force, which balances the driving force, is assumed
to be linearly proportional to the relative ﬂuid velocity with respect to the solid. This results
in a linear relationship between the ﬂow velocity and driving forces. While these assumptions
are reasonable for single-phase ﬂow, one may expect many other factors to aﬀect the balance of
forces in the case of multiphase ﬂow. Hassanizadeh and Gray [7, 8] developed a uniﬁed model

based on rational thermodynamics leading to additional driving forces. The macroscale eﬀects
of interfacial forces were included and the momentum balance equations are derived for both
phases and interfaces. They found that the driving forces for the ﬂow of a phase were the gradients of Gibbs free energy of the phase plus gravity. In the case of single-phase ﬂow, the gradient
of Gibbs free energy reduces to the gradient of pressure. Moreover, capillary pressure is not a
hysteretic function of saturation only, but uniquely deﬁned by a capillary pressure-saturationspeciﬁc interfacial area surface. In Hassanizadeh and Gray [7], the equations constitute a very
complex model that includes many diﬀerent eﬀects. However, some of these eﬀects are being of
second order, whereas several of the involved constitutive relationships have not been investigated so far. In Hassanizadeh and Gray [8], the momentum balance equations were simpliﬁed.
These studies were followed by a number of other studies (e.g. [9, 10]). Most of these works
were done using pore–network modeling and/or experiments and very few attempts were done
to simulate the macroscale multiphase ﬂow model including the speciﬁc interfacial area such
as Ref. [17]. The IMplicit Pressure Explicit Saturation (IMPES) approach solves the pressure equation implicitly and updates the saturation explicitly. In IMPES method, the time
step size should be very small, in particular, for highly heterogeneous permeable media. Because the decoupling between the pressure equation and the saturation equation, the IMPES
method is conditionally stable. Iterative IMPES splits the equation system into a pressure and
a saturation equation that are solved sequentially as IMPES [14, 15, 13].
The objective of this work is to develop an accurate numerical simulator for two-phase ﬂow
in porous media including speciﬁc interfacial area using appropriate numerical methods. The
cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerence (CCFD) method together with the shifting-matrices approach are
used for spacial discretization, while the upwind scheme is used to treat the advection terms in
the diﬀerential system.

Modeling and Mathematical Formulation

Hassanizadeh and Gray [7] have used a thermodynamic approach using the concept of Gibbs
free energy. They concluded that the movement of each phase or interface is governed by its
gradient in Gibbs free energy. Now, let us consider the ﬂow of two immiscible and compressible
ﬂuids including interfacial area. Assuming that the porosity is constant; the interfacial mass
density is constant; the gravity does not have eﬀect on interfacial movement; all material
properties are neglected; mass exchange between phases and interfaces has negligible eﬀect on
mass balance of phases; and the cross-coupling terms are negligible. Therefore, the governing
equations describing the above system can be written as follows [16],
φ

+ ∇ · v α = qα ,
∂t

vα = −K

α = w, n

(4)

where φ is porosity, Sα , vα and qα denote, respectively, to the saturation, the Darcy’s velocity
and the source term of the α phase. α stands for the wetting–phase (w) or the nonwetting–
phase (n). K is the intrinsic permeability, μα is the dynamic viscosity, krα denotes the relative

permeability, ρα the density and pα the pressure of the phase α. awn [m−1 ] is the speciﬁc interfacial area. vwn [m · s−1 ] is the interfacial velocity. Kwn [m3 · s−1 ] is the interfacial permeability.
Ewn [m−1 · s−1 ] is the production rate of speciﬁc interfacial area. For the production rate of
speciﬁc interfacial area Joekar-Niasar et al. [11] have deﬁned it as,
Ewn = −ewn

∂Sw
∂t

(5)

To estimate the production rate of speciﬁc interfacial area they neglect the advective ﬂux term
of Eq.(3). Also the term is calculated as the rate of change of speciﬁc interfacial area with
time. They deﬁned a linear relationship between Ewn and −∂Sw /∂t. In their work, they also
deﬁned ewn as being a linear function of Sw : ewn = e1 + e2 Sw . The coeﬃcients e1 and e2
depend on wetting-phase and non-wetting phase viscosity. On the other hand, in order to
close the above system of equations three relations have been added. The ﬁrst relation is the
the sum of wetting-phase and non-wetting phase saturations equals one. The second relation
is the diﬀerence between non-wetting phase and wetting-phase pressure which is equal to the
capillary pressure. The last relation indicates that interfacial speciﬁc area is a function of the
wetting-phase saturation and the capillary pressure.
S w + Sn = 1

(6)

pc = pn − pw

(7)

awn = awn (Sw , pc )

(8)

For the last relation of closure one can use a bi-quadratic relationship depends on Sw and pc
(see Ref. [12]). Instead of the above complicated formula, we will use the following ﬂexible
form Ref. [10],
α
awn (Sw , pc ) = α1 Sw (1 − Sw ) 2 pc α3
(9)
where α1 , α2 and α3 are constants.
Now, let us deﬁne the potential phase α pressure as Φα = pα − ρα g, and the potential
capillary pressure as Φc = pc − (ρn − ρw ) g. Also, the total velocity is deﬁned as vt = vw + vn ,
the total mobility λt = λw + λn . Adding the saturation equation of wetting phase to the
saturation equation of nonwetting phase (1) with the aid of (6), one may obtain,
∇ · vt ≡ −∇ · λt (Sw ) K∇Φw − ∇ · λn (Sw ) K∇Φc (Sw , anw ) = Qt

(10)

where Qt = qw + qn . Also, the wetting phase velocity may be deﬁned as,
vw = −λw K∇Φw ,
Therefore, saturation equation of the wetting phase may be written as,
φ

∂Sw
∂Sw
− ∇ · λw K∇Φw ≡ φ
− ∇ · vw = qw .
∂t
∂t

(11)

From (3), (5) and (11), we can write the equation of speciﬁc interfacial area as,

Iterative Implicit Scheme

Deﬁne the time step length Δtn = nn+1 − tn , the total time interval [0, T ] may be divided into
N time steps as 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tN = T . The current time step is represented by the
superscript n + 1. The backward Euler time discretization is used for the equations (10)-(12),
to obtain,

The system (20)–(22) is fully implicit, coupled and highly nonlinear, so it can not be solved
directly. Hence, iterative methods are often employed to solve such kind of complicated systems. Now, let us introduce the iterative Implicit Pressure Explicit Saturation-Interfacial Area

The superscripts k and k + 1 represent the iterative steps within the current time step n + 1.
For each iteration, the variables λw , λn and λt are calculated using the saturation from the
previous iteration. However, we may consider the saturation and the speciﬁc interfacial area at
the current iteration step instead of the previous iteration to obtain the capillary potential Φc .
We may linearize the capillary potential Φc as follows,

The changes of saturation and interfacial area in a time step are often very small, and hence
the linear approximation is reasonable. Moreover, the relaxation approach is often applied to
control the convergence of nonlinear iterative solvers. In this algorithm we use the following
two relaxation relationships for saturation and interfacial area as,

Spatial Discretization

Now, let us apply the CCFD scheme to the system of equations (23)–(28) to obtain the iterative
discretization. The discretization form of the pressure equation may be given as,
n+1,k

It is noted from above algebraic equations that the matrices Aw and Ac depend on the vector
n+1,k
n+1,k+1

at the previous iteration step, while the vector Pc depends on both vectors Sw
n+1,k+1
and anw
at the current iteration step, which may be written as, in a matrix-vector form
as follows,
n+1,k+1 n+1,k+1 ∼

where the matrices Ps and Pa are diagonal resulted from the discretization of ∂S

respectively. In fact, the derivatives of Φc are viewed as functions of Φc when the saturation
and the interfacial area at each spatial point vary with time. At the same time, the saturation
and the interfacial area are smoothly changing along with time at each spatial point even they
are discontinuously distributed in space.
Also, the CCFD discretization of the saturation equation (24) may lead to,

where M is a diagonal matrix replaces the porosity that appears in the saturation equation and
also it is a function of cell area. It is worth mentioning that the above equation of saturation
is coupled with the pressure equation to be solved implicitly together, however it is not used to
update the saturation.
Similarly, the CCFD discretization of the interfacial area equation (25) can be given as,

Numerical Experiments

This section analyzes some results of saturation, capillary pressure and speciﬁc interfacial area.
For example, we choose ﬂuid parameters (densities, viscosities, and diﬀusion constants) of water and air; for the matrix parameters, we take typical soil parameters, here k = 10−10 m2 and
φ = 0.3. We take a rough estimate of knw = 10−5 m3 s−1 . We set the interfacial permeability Kwn to 10−5 m3 /s. The ratio between non-wetting phase and wetting-phase viscosity is
μn /μw = 0.1. The coeﬃcients for the production rate of speciﬁc interfacial area we use the
values from Ref. [10]. The initial condition for the speciﬁc interfacial awn is taken as 5790 [1/m]
and at the boundary conditions are given as: 1000 [1/m] on the west boundary; 5790 [1/m]
on the east boundary; and 0 [1/m] on the north and south boundary. Also, the boundary
conditions of the interface velocity vwn , is considered 0.001 [m/year] on the west boundary and
0 [m/year] on the east, north and south boundaries. The parameters in the capillary pressure
formula are set to α1 = 250 000, α2 = 1.18 and α3 = −0.8. Figure 1 represents relation between speciﬁc interfacial area, saturation and capillary pressure. It is interesting to note that
this 3D surface is comparable to previous experimental and computational studies, [1, 10, 18].
Figure 2(a) shows the variation of capillary pressure with saturation. From this ﬁgure we may
conclude that the capillary pressure increases with decreasing wetting-phase saturation. The
variations of the speciﬁc interfacial area with wetting-phase saturation are plotted in Fig. 2(b).
According to this ﬁgure, one can observe that the speciﬁc interfacial area decreases with increasing the wetting-phase saturation.
In another example, we choose counter-current imbibition model [3, 4, 5, 6, 2]. In the case
of considering the speciﬁc–interfacial–area, the capillary pressure formula pc (Sw , awn ) is very
sensitive to its parameters. The values of these parameters may be modiﬁed based on the type
of porous media and other physical and computational aspects. So, here we investigate the
sensitivity of the capillary pressure parameters, namely, α1 , α2 and α3 . In Fig. 3a, the speciﬁc
interfacial area is plotted against the capillary pressure with diﬀerent values of α1 , at α2 = 1.18
and α3 = −0.8. This ﬁgure shows that the speciﬁc interfacial area could has same values for
diﬀerent capillary pressure ranges based on the values of the parameter α1 . Fig. 3b shows
the speciﬁc interfacial area proﬁles against the capillary pressure with various values of the
parameter α2 , at α1 = 2.5 × 107 and α3 = −0.8. It is interesting to note from Fig. 3b that the
behavior of the interfacial area proﬁles with small values of α2 is totally diﬀerent from those
with bigger values of α2 . The speciﬁc interfacial area decreases as the parameter α2 decreases
and opposite is true for the capillary pressure. The speciﬁc interfacial area is plotted in Fig. 3c
against the capillary pressure with diﬀerent values of α3 , at α1 = 2.5 × 107 and α2 = 1.18.
It can be seen from this ﬁgure that as the parameter α3 increases the interfacial area slightly
increases with bigger values of the capillary pressure. Also, Fig. Fig. 3c illustrates the capillary
pressure variation against the water saturation at diﬀerent values of α1 , at α2 = 1.18 and
α3 = −0.8. It is clear from this ﬁgure that as the parameter α1 increases the capillary pressure
increases. Moreover, it is interesting to note from the same ﬁgure that the capillary pressure
has reasonable physical values of α1 ≥ o(105 ). The proﬁles of the capillary pressure are plotted
in Fig. 3d against the water saturation with diﬀerent values of the parameter α2 = 0.01 : 2.5, at
α1 = 2.5×107 and α3 = −0.8. It is clear here that when α2 > 1, the behavior of the Pc −S curve
deviates from the standard behavior. Fig. 3e shows the capillary pressure against the water
saturation with diﬀerent values of the α3 , with α1 = 2.5 × 107 and α2 = 1.18. From Fig. 3f,
it can be noted that the behavior of the Pc − S curve deviates from the standard behavior at
α3 > −0.8.
