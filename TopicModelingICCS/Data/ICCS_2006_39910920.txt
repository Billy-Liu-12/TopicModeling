Abstract. A Maple Package named Mackendrick is presented. Such
package is oriented to symbolic computational epidemiology.

Introduction

We present here, the maple package Mackendrick which we have constructed for
the solution of certain problems in symbolic computational epidemiology. Our
package does not incorporate any kind of element of artiﬁcial intelligence, but for
some of the problems that we solved, will be very funny to have some computer
algebra system with artiﬁcial intelligence. The problems that we can solve here
are linear problems but such problems only can be solved using computer algebra,
due the involved calculations are very tedious and long as to be implemented by
hand using pen and paper only.
Our emblematic problems are situations of spatial propagation of directly
transmitted diseases when boundary conditions are involved at the form of endemic boundaries from where the disease spreads towards the interior of the
habitat. More over, we consider here the extra complication that arises from the
inclusion of the eﬀects of heterogeneity of contact between individuals.
A fundamental epidemiological magnitude is the well know basic reproductive
rate, denoted R0 . The principal function of the our package Mackendrick is the
computation of the explicit analytical form of the R0 for certain spatial models
of disease diﬀusion with heterogeneity eﬀects. We need here, computer algebra,
because that it is required is a symbolic expression for R0 and not a number
or a graphic. Due, our package is constructed under maple platform, then our
package has numerical and graphical computational power too.

The package is loaded with
restart:
with(Mackendrick);
and the notiﬁcation is
[dielou, difumemoestra, memo, memoyf, mysol,prosize,sir,veneco,
venecomemo];
which is the list of procedures that are contained within Mackendrick.
In the following sections, the commands of Mackendrick are presented.

The Command mysol

For example, the procedure mysol solves the following problem:
∂

with the boundary condition
u(a, t) = μb e−ηt .

The procedure mysol needs as inputs the speciﬁcal forms of the functions M0 (t),
M1 (t) and M2 (t). Here we present two cases.
2.1

Without Memory

For example when
M0 (t) = 0, M1 (t) = 0, M2 (t) = 0,
and with the instructions
M0:=0:M1:=0:M2:=0:
mysol(M0,M1,M2);
Mackendrick produces the following solution [1]

Conclusions

We believe that the Maple package Mackendrick can be useful within the
domain of symbolic computational epidemiology. Our Mackendrick can solve
certain complex spatial epidemic models. The method of solution that Mackendrick incorporates is the Laplace transform technique with the application
of the Bromwich integral and residue theorem for the realization of the inverse
Laplace transform [4]. Also, Mackendrick involves certain theorem of Linear Algebra, which is presented in [3]. This theorem must be introduced ad hoc but it is
possible that with the future development of artiﬁcial intelligence, such theorem
can be proved directly by the computer algebra system that is the background
of Mackendrick . We hope that at the future our package can be extended and
applied to more numerous and complex problems in mathematical epidemiology.
