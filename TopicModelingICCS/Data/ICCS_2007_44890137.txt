Abstract. The Hilbert-Huang transform is viewed as a promising method to
process the nonlinear and non-stationary signal. However, it hasn’t been a
general method in signal processing due to its some deficiencies. In this paper,
an algorithm is proposed to resolve one of its deficiencies that the EMD will
generate redundant IMFs at the low-frequency region. This deficiency may
cause misinterpretation to the result of processing signal. The experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm successfully resolves this deficiency.
Keywords: eliminating redundant IMFs; Hilbert-Huang transform; EMD.

1 Introduction
The wavelet transform has become one of the fast-evolving tools for analyzing
nonlinear and non-stationary signals in the past decade. However, with the wide
application of wavelet transform, some crucial deficiencies are reported. Hence, a new
type of time-frequency analysis called Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) has been
proposed by N.E. Huang in 1998[1].
Compared with the wavelet transform, HHT has many advantages which were
described in literature [2]. Nevertheless, in practical application, HHT has also some
deficiencies, which will be described in detail in section 2. In this paper, an algorithm
is proposed to resolve one of them.

2 The Deficiencies of Hilbert-Huang Transform
HHT consists of two main steps, the first step is data “sifting” to generate the intrinsic
mode functions (IMFs) and the second step is to apply the Hilbert transform to the
IMFs. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) which is the key part of this
method is employed to “sift” data, by means of which any complicated data can be
decomposed into a finite number of IMFs. The instantaneous frequency, determined
by Hilbert Transform (HT) of IMF, provided much sharper identification of
embedded events beyond the limitation of the Uncertainty Principle. HHT is
described in detail in literature [1].

HHT seems to be a perfect method to process the nonlinear and non-stationary
signal. However, in practice, HHT has some unsolved problems. First, the EMD will
generate some undesired low amplitude IMFs at the low-frequency region and raise
some undesired frequency components. Second, the first IMF may cover a wide
frequency range at the high-frequency region, therefore cannot satisfy the monocomponent definition very well. Third, the EMD operation often cannot separate
some low-energy components from the analysis signal; therefore those components
may not be able to appear in the frequency-time plane. In this paper, all effort is
dedicated to resolve the first deficiency because the second and third have been
solved in [3] [4].
Now, let’s observe the first deficiency according to one example. Let the signal is
equal to: x(t) = sin(2 ∗π ∗10∗ t) + sin(2 ∗π ∗15∗t) + sin(2 ∗π ∗ 20∗t) + sin(2 ∗π ∗30∗t)
and the results of EMD of x(t) and the FFT of IMFs are described in fig. 1.
There are four mono-components in the signal x(t) so that four IMFs should be
acquired by EMD. However, ten IMFs are seen according to the left section of fig. 1
and we can observe that all the redundant IMFs have lower frequency than the lowest
frequency of the signal x(t) from the right section.

3 The Proposed Algorithm
In [3], [4], the correlation coefficients of IMFs and the signal is used as a criterion to
decide which IMFs should be retained and which IMFs should be eliminated because
the author thinks that the real IMF components will have relative good correlation
with the original signal and on the other hand, the pseudo-components will only have
poor correlation with the signal. However, the analysis is not logical. If the real IMFs
have relative good correlation with the original signal, they will be also relative good
correlation each other. This is inconsistent with the characteristic of EMD which the
IMFs are almost an orthogonal representation for the analyzed signal. In [5], [6],
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is employed to resolve the same problem. Nevertheless,
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is mainly used to check if two independent distributions
are similar or different.
According to the theory of EMD, the following equation is obtained
i −1

vi (t ) = x(t ) − hi (t ) = ∑ hi (t ) +
j =1

n

∑ h (t ) + r (t ) .

j = i +1

where, x(t), hi(t), rn(t) are the processed signal, IMF and the residual signal
respectively.
The redundant IMFs have not only lower frequency than the lowest frequency of
the signal x(t) but also less amplitude. This can be explained that the redundant IMFs
are generated due to leaking in the decomposing process of EMD. Therefore, if the
energy of vi(t) is almost equal to that of x(t), hi(t) is viewed as the redundant IMF. The
ratio of the energy of vi(t) to x(t) will be constructed to eliminate the redundant IMFs .
It is defined as

If Dm is equal to a local
maximum of DL and Lm+1 is
more than T0 (in general,
0.95≤T0 1), hi(t) (1≤
)
are viewed as the real IMFs.
There are two reasons why
the proposed method is logical
to eliminate the redundant
IMFs. Firstly, it is based on the
fact that the redundant IMFs
have lower frequency and less

amplitude than the lowest
frequency of the signal x(t).
Secondly, the frequency of hk(t) is higher than that of hn(t) if k is lesser than n. In a
word, there is a local maximum of DL at the boundary between the real IMFs and the
redundant IMFs.

From the table 2, it can be seen that m is equal to four. So, the first four IMFs are
viewed as the real IMFs and other are the redundant IMFs. This is consistent with the
fact.
The instantaneous frequency estimated by Hilbert-Huang transform without the
proposed algorithm is presented in fig. 2 and with the proposed algorithm in Fig. 3.
From the two figures, those can be seen that the first deficiency of HHT will cause
misinterpretation to the result and the proposed algorithm successfully eliminate the
redundant IMFs so that obtain the real instantaneous frequency of the signal x(t).

5 Conclusion
HHT provides a new method for processing the nonlinear and non-stationary signal
and has received great attention in various areas, but it is not a perfect tool in practical
application due to some deficiencies. In this paper, only one of them, that is, the EMD
will generate redundant IMFs at the low-frequency, is discussed. To resolve the
problem, an algorithm is proposed which is based on the cause of generating the
redundant IMFs and the characteristics of EMD. In the algorithm, a threshold m is
calculated which must satisfy some proper conditions, then hi(t) (1≤
) are viewed
as the real IMFs and other the redundant IMFs to be eliminated finally. The results of
experiment show that the proposed algorithm is effective on improving HHT.
