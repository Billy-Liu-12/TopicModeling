Abstract. An edge-coloring of a graph G is equitable if, for each vertex
v of G, the number of edges of any one color incident with v diﬀers from
the number of edges of any other color incident with v by at most one.
A graph G is called equitable if G has an equitable edge-coloring with k
colors for any integer k ≥ 1. A plane graph is series-parallel graph if it
contains no subgraphs homeomorphic to K4 . In the paper, we prove that
any simple and connected series-parallel graph is equitable if and only if
it is not an odd circuit.
Keywords: edge-coloring; equitable, series-parallel graph.

Introduction

Throughout the paper, all graphs are ﬁnite, simple and undirected. Let G be
a graph, V (G) and E(G) denote the set of vertices and the set of edges of G,
respectively. We associate positive integer 1, 2, . . . with colors, and call C a kedge-coloring of G if C : E → {1, 2, . . . , k}. Let Cv−1 (i) denote the number of
edges of G incident with vertex v that receive color i by the coloring C. We call
C an equitable k-edge-coloring of G if for each vertex v ∈ V
|Cv−1 (i) − Cv−1 (j)| ≤ 1

(1 ≤ i < j ≤ k) .

A graph G is called equitable if G has an equitable k-edge-coloring for any
integer k ≥ 1. It is an interesting problem to determine whether a graph is
equitable or not. If a graph is equitable, then its edge chromatic index is equal to
its maximum degree Δ and its edge cover chromatic index equal to its minimum
degree δ (refer to [1] for the deﬁnition of edge cover chromatic index).
A plane graph is series-parallel graph if it contains no subgraphs homeomorphic to K4 , denoted by SP graph brieﬂy. A series-parallel graph is a kind of
very interesting graph which has many good properties and is well applied in
electricity networks.
A circuit is a connected graph in which each vertex has even degree. A circuit
is odd, or even, if the number of edges is odd, or even, respectively. It is stated in

[2] that a connected graph G has an equitable 2-edge-coloring if and only if it is
not an odd circuit. Hilton and Werra [3] gave a suﬃcient condition for equitable
edge-coloring of simple graphs. Werra[2] has proved that all bipartite graphs are
equitable. Wu Jian-liang [4] has proved that a connected outerplanar graph is
equitable if and only if it is not an odd circuit.

The Main Result

In this paper, we consider the equitable edge-coloring of simple series-parallel
graphs and obtain the following result.
Theorem 1. Any simple and connected series-parallel graph is equitable if and
only if it is not an odd circuit.
Firstly we discuss the properties on the structure of series-parallel graphs. Wu
Jian-liang has made many researchs on the structure of series-parallel graphs
and gained some results by which some problems on the list edge-coloring and
the linear arboricity of series-parallel graphs are successfully solved (see [5,6]).
We will discuss the structure of series-parallel graphs more meticulously by new
methods. Our result on the structure of series-parallel graphs will be more appropriate for the discussion of the equitable edge-coloring of series-parallel graphs.
A 2-connected series-parallel graph can be gained from K2 by iteratively using
the following operations: Replace an edge with a path of length 2 (denoted by
S-operation brieﬂy) or duplicate an edge (denoted by P-operation brieﬂy). For
every 2-connected series-parallel graph, we can express the operation process
with a complete binary tree. For we always begin constructing a SP graph with
K2 , let an isolated point denote the only edge in K2 at the beginning. If an
S-operation is performed on an edge, call the point representing the edge S-node
and join two son nodes to the S-node each of which represents one of the two
edges on the path of length 2 respectively; If a P-operation is performed on an
edge, call the point representing the edge P-node and join two son nodes to the
P-node which represent the edge and its duplicate respectively. By the above
process, every 2-connected series-parallel graph G corresponds to a complete
binary tree T .
By discussing the corresponding complete binary trees in detail, we obtain
the properties on the structure of simple SP graphs which are described in the
following lemma. In the following, NG (v) denotes the set of vertices adjacent to
a vertex v in G, without confusion, N (v) brieﬂy. A vertex v is called a k-vertex
if |NG (v)| = k.
Lemma 1. Let G be a simple and 2-connected series-parallel graph of order at
least 5. Then one of the following conditions holds:
1. G has two adjacent 2-vertices x and y;
2. G has two diﬀerent 2-vertices x and y and N (x) = N (y);
3. G has a 4-vertex z adjacent to two 2-vertices x and y such that N (z)\{x, y} =
{N (x) ∪ N (y)} \ {z};

4. G has a 3-vertex w with N (w) = {x, y, z} such that both x and y are 2vertices, N (x) = {z, w} and yz ∈
/ E(G);
5. G has two adjacent 3-vertices x and y such that N (x) ∩ N (y) = {z} and
N (z) = {x, y};
6. G has two adjacent 3-vertices w1 and w2 such that N (w1 ) = {x, z1 , w2 },
N (w2 ) = {y, z2 , w1 }, N (x) = {z1 , w1 } and N (y) = {z2 , w2 };
7. G has a 3-vertex w with N (w) = {x, y, z} such that N (z) = {w, y} and
xy ∈ E(G);
8. G has two nonadjacent 3-vertices w1 and w2 such that N (w1 ) = {x, y, z1 },
N (w2 ) = {x, y, z2 }, N (z1 ) = {x, w1 } and N (z2 ) = {y, w2 };
9. G has two nonadjacent 3-vertices w1 and w2 such that N (w1 ) = {x, y, z1 },
N (w2 ) = {x, y, z2 }, N (z1 ) = {x, w1 } and N (z2 ) = {x, w2 };
10. G has a 3-vertex w with N (w) = {x, z1 , z2 } such that there is a 2-vertex
y ∈ N (z1 ) ∩ N (z2 ) and N (x) = {z1 , w}.
Let C denote color set {1, 2, · · · , k}. Given a edge-coloring ϕ of G in which k
colors in C are used. For each vertex v ∈ V (G), let ϕ−1
v (i) denote the number
of edges of G incident with vertex v that receive color i by the coloring ϕ, and
−1
let Cϕ (v) = {i|ϕ−1
v (i) = min ϕv (j)}. Obviously, |Cϕ (v)| ≥ 1.
1≤j≤k

Now we will give the main idea for the proof of our theorem. It is known that
a connected graph G has an equitable 2-edge-coloring if and only if it is not an
odd circuit. So it is only to prove that any simple and connected SP graph G
has an equitable k-edge-coloring for any integer k ≥ 3. We prove the result by
induction on |G|, the number of vertices of G.
When |G| ≤ 4, the result is obvious. Assume that p (p ≥ 5) is an integer and
that the theorem holds for all simple SP graphs with less than p vertices. Let G
be a simple and connected SP graph of order p. If G is not 2-connected, there
is a cut vertex v ∈ V (G) such that G − v is not connected. Select a component
of G − v arbitrarily, let S denote its vertex set, S¯ denote the set of vertices in
G − v which do not belong to S. Let G1 denote the subgraph of G induced by
S ∪ {v}, G2 denote the subgraph of G induced by S¯ ∪ {v}. It is obvious that
E(G) = E(G1 )∪E(G2 ) and V (G) = V (G1 )∪V (G2 ). Because both G1 and G2 are
SP graphs of order less than p, then G1 and G2 have equitable k-edge-colorings
ϕ1 and ϕ2 respectively. Let k1 = k − |Cϕ1 (v)|, k2 = |Cϕ2 (v)|. By interchanging
the colors used, an equitable k-edge-coloring ϕ1 of G1 and an equitable k-edgecoloring ϕ2 of G2 will be gained such that C\Cϕ1 (v) = {1, 2, · · · , k1 }, Cϕ2 (v) =
{1, 2, · · · , k2 }. Combine coloring ϕ1 in G1 with coloring ϕ2 in G2 , an equitable
k-edge-coloring of G will be gained.
In the following we suppose that G is 2-connected. According to Lemma 1,
the proof can be divided into ten parts. In every case as described in Lemma 1,
we always obtain a simple SP graph G∗ of order less than p. By the induction
hypothesis, G∗ has an equitable k-edge-coloring ϕ. On the basis of ϕ, we always
can construct an equitable k-edge-coloring σ of G using the same set of k colors.
By the induction, the theorem is true.

Concluding Remarks

An outerplanar graph is a graph which contains no subgraphs homeomorphic to
K4 or K2,3 . That is to say, an outerplanar graph is also a series-parallel graph.
From this point of view, our result generalizes the result in [4].
