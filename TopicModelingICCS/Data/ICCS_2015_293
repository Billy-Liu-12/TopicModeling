Abstract
Computational and storage costs of resolution of large sparse linear systems Ax = b can be
performed by reducing the bandwidth of A. Bandwidth reduction consists of carrying out permutations of lines and columns so that they allow coeﬃcients to remain near the main diagonal.
When considering an adjacency matrix of a graph, bandwidth reduction can be considered in
the sense of modifying the order in which the graph vertices are numbered. Heuristics for bandwidth reduction are revised in this study, aiming at determining which of them oﬀers the higher
bandwidth reduction with a reasonable computational cost. Speciﬁcally, metaheuristic-based
heuristics are reviewed in this systematic review. Moreover, 29 metaheuristic-based heuristics tested for bandwidth reduction were found. Among them, 4 are recommended as possible
state-of-the-art heuristics for addressing the problem.

Introduction

Many simulations in science and engineering require resolution of large sparse linear systems
Ax = b, in which A is a sparse matrix. Generally, it is the part of the experiment that
demands the highest computational cost. As Benzi [4] explained, the main source of problems
with large-scale matrices arises from discretization (and linearization) of elliptical or parabolic
partial diﬀerential equations. For example, discretization of a mathematical model can lead to
a large system of non-linear equations. Linearization methods can reduce it to a series of large
sparse linear systems. Some of the most popular numerical methods for problem-solving related
to physical phenomena that are modeled by partial diﬀerential equations are the methods of
ﬁnite elements, ﬁnite diﬀerences and ﬁnite volumes. Large sparse linear systems are produced in
applying these methods. On the other hand, large sparse linear systems are also originated from
applications that are not modeled by partial diﬀerential equations such as design and analysis
of integrated circuits, power system networks, chemical engineering processes and economic
models. Benzi [4] presented a description of the main areas in which large sparse linear systems
need to be solved. Since they are on a large scale, they need a lot of memory and high processing

costs for storage and for solving these linear systems. For example, Kaveh [22, p. 221] explained
that in structural mechanics, 30% to 50% of the computational cost can be related to solving
linear systems for problems that are found in practice and it may reach 80% in non-linear
problems for optimization of structures.
Heuristics for bandwidth reduction are used to obtain low computational and storage costs
for solving large sparse linear systems. Let’s consider an n × n symmetric matrix A = [aij ].
βi (A) = i − min(j : (1 ≤ j < i) aij = 0) is the bandwidth of line i of A. Considering all
lines of A, bandwidth β(A) is the largest diﬀerence between a non-null coeﬃcient of the lower
triangular matrix and the main diagonal: β(A) = max((1 ≤ i ≤ n) βi (A)) = max((1 ≤ i ≤
n) (1 ≤ j < i) (i − j) | aij = 0).
The Conjugate Gradient Method [19, 28] is often used for the numerical solution of largescale, symmetric and positive-deﬁnite sparse linear systems. One can reduce the computational
cost of this method by applying a “local” ordering of the vertices of the corresponding graph
of the coeﬃcient matrix A in order to improve cache hit rates. This local ordering can be
obtained by a heuristic for bandwidth reduction. Additionally, one can solve a linear system
Ax = b by Gaussian Elimination (and methods based on it) with lower computational cost if
the bandwidth of the symmetric matrix A is reduced. Tarjan [47] proved that the Gaussian
Elimination requires O(n · β 2 ) operations to solve a linear system with n lines and bandwidth β.
Clearly, if β ∼
= n, then, O(n3 ) operations are carried out. In addition, when a storage scheme
based on vectors is applied, the Gaussian Elimination needs O(n · β) spaces in memory.
The bandwidth minimization problem seems that began in the 1950s when structural engineers analyzed the computational resolution of large sparse linear systems and were already
concerned about the bandwidth of the matrices – for example, see Livesley [36] and references
cited therein. One can understand the bandwidth minimization problem as ﬁnding the smallest
bandwidth of a symmetric matrix. As shown by Papadimitriou [40], this problem is hard. When
an arbitrary integer k and graph G are given, Garey et al. [14] proved that it is NP-complete
to decide whether or not there exists an ordering of the vertices such that the adjacency matrix has bandwidth ≤ k, even when G is deﬁned by the class of free trees with all vertices of
degree ≤ 3. Checking all n! possible sequences associated to a matrix of a suﬃcient large n is
surely impracticable. Therefore, since the 1960s, hundreds of heuristics have been put forward
for the bandwidth, proﬁle and/or wavefront reduction. These problems are interrelated but
independent. In simple terms, bandwidth reduction of a matrix A is obtained by means of
permutations of lines and columns so that the non-null coeﬃcients stay close to the main diagonal of A. Therefore, considering A as an adjacency matrix of a graph G, bandwidth reduction
can be carried out by reordering the vertices of G. A great deal of heuristics for bandwidth
reduction has been published and discover which of them is the best one is not a simple task.
This is due to features of the instance of the problem to be solved such as: size and sparseness of
the matrix, disposal and distribution of the non-null coeﬃcients, computational cost, required
memory, proﬁle of the matrix, envelope, bandwidth etc.
A high bandwidth reduction is reached by some heuristics for this problem. However, these
heuristics may require a proportional high computational cost to perform the task. Clearly,
the computational cost gain reached in solving a large sparse linear system after the matrix
bandwidth reduction should not be compromised by a high computational cost required to
reduce the bandwidth. Additionally, a signiﬁcant bandwidth reduction may not be proportional
to the computational cost reduction acquired for solving the linear system. Thus, this systematic
investigation of metaheuristic-base heuristics for bandwidth reduction was undertaken aiming at
determining the best heuristics for very large bandwidth reduction at reasonable computational
costs.

This study is structured as follows. Section 2 is concerned about how the systematic inquiry was performed in this study. In Section 3, assessments and comparisons’ details of the
heuristics are addressed. Section 4 outlines the best possible heuristics that present very large
bandwidth reduction at reasonable computational cost performances. Section 5 addresses ﬁnal
considerations and recommendations for future investigations related to this study.

Systematic Review

This present review began in May, 2014. It concerns metaheuristic-based heuristics for bandwidth reduction. It was guided with the support of Scopus R database. A search was carried
out in Scopus R database using the terms: TITLE-ABS-KEY((matrix bandwidth reduction)
or (matrix bandwidth minimization)). These items were searched in the title, abstract and
keywords of the articles indexed in the electronic database. This search resulted in 502 papers.
Only metaheuristic-based heuristics for bandwidth reduction were selected among these articles
retrieved.
Two reviewers then analysed independently the titles and abstracts of the articles found. A
third reviewer was not necessary as there were no disaccord in the selections made. In addition
to the papers that matched the eligibility criteria, other papers were studied to support the
conceits involved in the heuristics that had been classiﬁed.
Afterwards, data were extracted to acquire a clear comparison of the articles selected. These
data were extracted according to the following headings: authors, year of publication, results
and conclusions. Among the 502 articles retrieved, 26 metaheuristic-based heuristics were
selected and are shown in Table 1. Then, a backward citation tracking was carried out based
on the papers found and 3 other heuristics were discovered. These 3 heuristics are listed in Table
2. Afterwards, simulations and comparisons related to these 29 metaheuristic-based heuristics
were examined. As a result of this study, no other publication was found that presented
simulations and comparisons in a way that could indicate that the 4 heuristics shown in Table
5 might be considered to be surpassed by any other heuristic.
In Figure 1, a graphic of the number of metaheuristic-based heuristics per year is shown.
There were 4 heuristics put forward in the period 1995-2005, 14 from 2006 to 2010 and 11
from 2011 to 2014. These numbers provide evidence that, currently, the major emphasis on the
design of heuristics for bandwidth reduction is with the application of metaheuristics.

Comparisons of Results of Metaheuristic-Based Heuristics

The GPS heuristic [18] was used as a benchmark in order to compare the heuristics’ results.
The GPS heuristic reduces the bandwidth at a low computational cost. It has been amply used
by researchers to compare the results of heuristics since it is a classic heuristic for bandwidth
reduction. However, it was not the only one used in this systematic review in the evaluations
and comparisons performed among the results of the heuristics for bandwidth reduction.

The 29 metaheuristic-based heuristics for bandwidth reduction found are listed in the ﬁrst
column of Table 3. The authors of the heuristics compared results of their heuristics with results
of other heuristics in their studies. Those comparisons made by the authors were examined
searching to determine heuristics that might have been surpassed by others. In the second
column of Table 3, it is shown heuristics whose bandwidth reduction surpassed or showed
comparable results, but with lower computational cost than the heuristic shown in the ﬁrst
column. These comparisons have been published in papers listed in the third column of Table
3. It should be noted that heuristics for bandwidth reduction are inherently dependent on the
instances. Despite this, comparisons and published results of the authors were studied and
considered as appropriated. Heuristics without being ﬁlled in the second and third columns of
Table 3 are commented below. Particularly, the identiﬁed 10 heuristics that surpassed results
of the Tabu Search for bandwidth reduction (TS-band ) heuristic [38] for bandwidth reduction
are listed in Table 4. Similarly, the identiﬁed 7 heuristics that surpassed results of the Greedy
Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure with Path Relinking (GRASPP R ) heuristic [41] for
bandwidth reduction are also listed in this table. The FNC-HC [32, 33, 35] and the PSOHC [30] heuristics showed slower computational costs than the GRASPP R heuristic. However,
results of GRASPP R were better than the results of the FNC-HC [32, 33, 35] heuristic and were

Table 4: Results of 10 and 7 heuristics surpassed results of Tabu Search (TS-band ) [38] and Greedy
Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure with Path Relinking (GRASPP R ) [41], respectively, in relation
to bandwidth reduction. Tests were presented in the articles in which the heuristics were introduced.

The Fast Node Centroid method with Hill-Climbing (FNC-HC heuristic) [32, 33, 35] is commented in subsection 4 as a possible best heuristic for bandwidth reduction because it presented
much lower computational cost than heuristics that surpassed it in bandwidth reduction. The
VNS-band heuristic [39] is also commented in subsection 4 because it showed results that stood
out compared to other heuristics. The hyper-heuristic based on Genetic Programming (GPHHband ) [26] is commented in subsection 4 because the heuristic generated by this hyper-heuristic
215

presented computational cost much lower than heuristics with it was compared. The heuristic based on the metaheuristic Charged System Search (CSS-band ) [24] is commented out in
subsection 4 because it also showed results that stood out in relation to other heuristics with
which it was compared.
The heuristic based on Genetic Programming of Pop and Matei (GP-band ) [45] and the
heuristic based on Genetic Algorithm of Pop, Matei and Comes [44] obtained, in tests conducted by these authors, results slightly better than results of the VNS-band heuristic [39]
in relation to bandwidth reduction. Among the heuristics compared by Pop and Matei [45]
and Pop, Matei and Comes [44], those both heuristics were probably the slowest heuristics,
according to the authors. Thus, those both heuristics were not considered as possible best
heuristics with signiﬁcantly bandwidth reduction because their computational costs may be
higher than the computational cost of the VNS-band heuristic: apart from a heuristic signiﬁcantly reduce the bandwidth, it must also present low computational cost, i.e., it cannot
be slow compared to other heuristics. By its turn, the heuristic of Pintea et al. [43], of
2012, was not considered as one of the possible best heuristic for bandwidth reduction. That
is because these authors did not compare their results with results of any other heuristic.
There are heuristics available to be compared, e.g., in MATLAB, such as Reverse CuthillMcKee with pseudo-peripheral initial vertex given by the George-Liu algorithm (RCM-GL)
[16] and Spectral [3] heuristics. Additionally, in Netlib (http://www.netlib.org), there are codes
of the GPS heuristic in http://www.netlib.org/toms/508 [7], and the Gibbs-King heuristic [17]
in http://www.netlib.org/509 [17]. Czibula et al. [9] proposed 3 heuristics that are not considered as the possible best for bandwidth reduction as well. Two of them are modiﬁcations
of the ant-colony heuristic of Pintea et al. [42] by introducing two local searches. Czibula et
al. [9] also applied a slight modiﬁcation in the genetic-algorithm heuristic of Lim, Rodrigues e
Xiao [31, 34]. Czibula et al. [9] did not show computational cost results and the obsolete CM
heuristic [8] presented better results in some of the very small number of instances tested.

Possible Best Metaheuristic-Based Heuristics

Metaheuristic-based heuristics that have been classiﬁed as being possibly better at bandwidth
reduction are addressed in this section. In order to be considered in this section as one of
the possible best alternatives for bandwidth reduction at a reasonable computational cost, a
heuristic must be able to yield results in bandwidth reduction that are signiﬁcantly better than
the results of the GPS heuristic and must have a computational cost that is not excessively
higher in comparison to the GPS heuristic, as shown, either directly or indirectly, in comparisons
made by researchers in their articles.
Although Mladenovic et al. [39] have not made comparisons with low computational-cost
heuristics in solving large sparse linear systems, the authors designated the Variable Neighbourhood Search for bandwidth reduction (VNS-band heuristic) [39], published in 2010, as
the state-of-the-art in bandwidth reduction. When compared directly or indirectly, most of
the metaheuristic-based heuristics obtained worse bandwidth reduction than the results of the
VNS-band heuristic. As described in Table 3, VNS-band heuristic obtained better bandwidth
reduction than the TS-band [38], GRASPP R [41], SS-TS [5], GA-HC [31, 34], NS-HC [34], PSOHC [30], and SA-δ [46] heuristics. In addition, the VNS-band heuristic presented a reasonable
computational cost in comparison with these heuristics. Therefore, the VNS-band heuristic was
considered to be one of the possible best heuristics since it presented a signiﬁcant bandwidth
reduction at a reasonable computational cost in tests shown by its authors.
In tests conducted by Kaveh and Sharaﬁ [24], in 2012, the CSS-band [24] heuristic yielded
216

Metaheuristic-based heuristics for bandwidth reduction

Chagas and Gonzaga de Oliveira

better results than the four-step heuristic [21] and than other Kaveh and Sharaﬁ’s heuristic
[23]. Moreover, the CSS-band heuristic obtained results that were approximately 11% better
than results of the four-steps heuristic [21] and 4% better than results of the heuristic of Kaveh
and Sharaﬁ [23]. Added to this, in two of three instances tested by Kaveh and Sharaﬁ [24],
the CSS-band heuristic was faster than the four-steps heuristic [21] and the heuristic of Kaveh
and Sharaﬁ [23]. Consequently, the CSS-band heuristic was also considered to be one of the
possible best heuristics since it presented a signiﬁcant bandwidth reduction at a reasonable
computational cost in tests showed by its authors.
Although the VNS-band heuristic might be the best heuristic for bandwidth reduction, the
computational cost of this heuristic might be considerably higher than the computational cost
of the GPS heuristic [18]. Many heuristics present worser results than the VNS-band heuristic
in bandwidth reduction; however, the computational costs of those heuristics are similar to,
or lower than, the computational cost of the GPS heuristic. Moreover, Mladenovic et al. [39]
only considered bandwidth reduction of matrices. This is important for storage costs and for
reducing the computational cost of direct methods for solving linear systems which contain those
matrices, as examples. On the other hand, an important issue in this context is the reduction of
the computational cost in solving linear systems by iterative methods. Let’s consider symmetricmatrix bandwidth reduction for diminishing the computational cost of solving large-scale linear
systems by methods based on Krylov’s subspace [27], as the Conjugate Gradient Method [28, 19].
As described, a local ordering of the graph vertices can avoid cache miss penalties. Thus, the
total cost of the resolution of the linear system may be higher using a heuristic that reduces
very much the bandwidth at a not very low computational cost than using a heuristic that
reduces the bandwidth to a reasonable extent but it incurs in a computational cost that is
much lower than the ﬁrst heuristic. For this reason, two heuristics that might be better with
regard to beneﬁts (i.e. bandwidth reduction) per computational costs were identiﬁed. These
two heuristics are commented below.
Results of the Fast Node Centroid method with Hill-Climbing (FNC-HC heuristic) [32, 33,
35] were not much worse than results of the GA-HC heuristic [31, 34] with regard to bandwidth
reduction. According to Lim, Rodrigues and Xiao [32, 33, 35], results of the FNC-HC heuristic
outperformed results of the GPS heuristic [18] with bandwidth reductions ranging from 34%
to 48%, when all instances that were used are taken into account. Furthermore, the FNC-HC
heuristic was considerably faster than the TS-band [38], GRASPP R [41], GA-HC [31, 34], NS-HC
[34], and NC-HC [32, 33, 35] heuristics. In addition, in tests carried out by Koohestani and Poli
[26] with the RCMM heuristic (Reverse Cuthill-McKee heuristic implemented in MATLAB ),
the hyper-heuristic based on Genetic Programming for bandwidth reduction (GPHH-band ) [26]
obtained results ranging from 5,7% to 10,6% better than the RCMM heuristic in bandwidth
reduction. It should be notice that, according to tests carried out by Esposito, Malucelli and
Tarricone [12], the RCMM heuristic achieved results that were approximately 8.5% better than
results obtained by the GPS heuristic with regard to bandwidth reduction. Moreover, the
GPHH-band [26] was the fastest in all instances tested by the authors.
As a result of this analysis, four metaheuristic-based heuristics were identiﬁed as presenting
a good relationship between bandwidth reduction at a reasonable computational cost. These
four heuristics are shown in Table 5.

The aim of this study was on comparisons made by researchers among diﬀerent heuristics for
bandwidth reduction of symmetric matrices. However, there are some heuristics (such as TS217

asymmetric matrices A = [aij ] in which if aij = 0, then, aji may be diﬀerent of 0.
In this systematic review, 29 metaheuristic-based heuristics tested for bandwidth reduction
were found. Among them, four are recommended as possible state-of-the-art heuristics for
addressing the problem: FNC-HC [32, 33, 35], VNS-band [39], GPHH-band [26] and CSS-band
[24]. Although probably this list of 29 metaheuristic-based heuristics is not exhaustive, most
likely results of the main ones were considered in this systematic review.
These four heuristics shall be implemented in order to compare their results and computational costs in future studies. Although heuristics for bandwidth reduction are dependent
on instances, the best heuristic(s) for bandwidth reduction at a reasonable computational cost
is/are expected to be found. In addition, it is expected that the heuristic(s) for bandwidth
reduction of symmetric matrices with the best relationship in bandwidth reduction at a reasonable computational costs can be discovered, leading to the highest computational cost reduction
in the resolution of linear systems.
