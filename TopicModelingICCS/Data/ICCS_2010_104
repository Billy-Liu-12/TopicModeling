“Network Science” is the new scientific discipline examining the interconnections among diverse physical or
engineered networks, information networks, biological networks, cognitive and semantic networks, and social
networks. However, the scope of this workshop is limited to engineered and social networks, that is, those networks
explicitly created by human beings by design (e.g. data networks, highway networks, transportation networks, etc)
or by the social interactions of human beings (e.g., community groups, business association, social internet sites,
etc). This workshop covers recent research in theory and applications of engineered & social networks.
The research described in this workshop includes: an investigation on interactions between networked social
communities using the Ising model to analyze the spread of rumours; an algorithm for community structure
recognition; the study of an existing model of risk perception on a social network and the changes in the efficiency
of the disease spread in comparison to previous studies that failed to take human behaviour into account; a study of
chat-lines in the framework of social networks; and a study of how packet switching network performance in
delivering packets to their destinations is affected by routing algorithm coupled with volume of incoming traffic, in
particular on the number of packets in transit that is an aggregate measure of a network quality of service (QoS)
performance.
