Abstract. Rainfall in Kerala State, the southern part of Indian Peninsula in particular is caused by the two monsoons and the two cyclones
every year. In general, climate and rainfall are highly nonlinear phenomena in nature giving rise to what is known as the ‘butterﬂy eﬀect’. We
however attempt to train an ABF neural network on the time series
rainfall data and show for the ﬁrst time that in spite of the ﬂuctuations
resulting from the nonlinearity in the system, the trends in the rainfall
pattern in this corner of the globe have remained unaﬀected over the past
87 years from 1893 to 1980. We also successfully ﬁlter out the chaotic
part of the system and illustrate that its eﬀects are marginal over long
term predictions.

Introduction

Although technology has taken us a long way towards better living standards,
we still have a signiﬁcant dependence on nature. Rain is one of nature’s greatest
gifts and in third world countries like India, the entire agriculture depends upon
rain. It is thus a major concern to identify any trends for rainfall to deviate from
its periodicity, which would disrupt the economy of the country. This fear has
been aggravated due to the threat by the global warming and green house eﬀect.
The present study has a soothing eﬀect since it concludes that in spite of short
term ﬂuctuations, the general pattern of rainfall in Kerala has not undergone
major deviations from its pattern in the past.
The geographical conﬁguration of India with the three oceans, namely Indian
Ocean, Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea bordering the peninsula gives her a
climate system with two monsoon seasons and two cyclones inter-spersed with
hot and cold weather seasons. The parameters that are required to predict the
rainfall are enormously complex and subtle so that the uncertainty in a prediction
using all these parameters is enormous even for a short period. The period over
which a prediction may be made is generally termed the event horizon and in
best results, this is not more than a week’s time. Thus it is generally said that
the ﬂuttering wings of a butterﬂy at one corner of the globe may cause it to
produce a tornado at another place geographically far away. This phenomenon
is known as the butterﬂy eﬀect.
The objective of this study is to ﬁnd out how well the periodicity in these
patterns may be understood using a neural network so that long term predictions

can be made. This would help one to anticipate with some degree of conﬁdence
the general pattern of rainfall for the coming years. To evaluate the performance
of the network, we train it on the rainfall data corresponding to a certain period
in the past and cross validate the prediction made by the network over some other
period. A diﬀerence diagram1 is plotted to estimate the extent of deviation between the predicted and actual rainfall. However, in some cases, the cyclone may
be either delayed or rushed along due to some hidden perturbations on the system, for example an increase in solar activity. (See ﬁgure 2.) These eﬀects would
appear as spikes in the diﬀerence diagram. The information from the diﬀerence
diagram is insuﬃcient to identify the exact source of such spike formation. It
might have resulted from slight perturbations from unknown sources or could
be due to an inaccurate modeling of the system using the neural network. We
thus use a standard procedure in statistical mechanics that can quantitatively
estimate the ﬂuctuations[1]. This is to estimate the diﬀerence in the Fourier
Power Spectra (FPS) of the predicted and actual sequences. In the FPS, the
power corresponding to each frequency interval, referred to as the spectral density gives a quantitative estimate of the deviations of the model from reality.
Rapid variations would contribute to high frequency terms and slowly varying
quantities would correspond to low frequency terms in the power spectra.
The degree of information that may be extracted from the FPS is of great
signiﬁcance. If the model agrees with reality, the diﬀerence of the power spectra (
hereafter referred to as the residual FPS ) should enclose minimum power in the
entire frequency range. An exact model would produce no diﬀerence and thus
no residual FPS pattern. If there are some prominent frequency components in
the residue, that could indicate two possibilities; either the network has failed to
comprehend the periodicity, or that there is a new trend in the real world which
did not exist in the past. One can test whether the same pattern exists in the
residual FPS produced on the training set and conﬁrm whether it is a new trend
or is the drawback of the model.
A random ﬂuctuation would be indicated in the residual FPS by amplitudes
at all frequency values as in the case of ‘white’ noise spectra. Here again, how
much power is enclosed within the FPS gives a quantitative estimate of the
perturbations. A low amplitude ﬂuctuation can happen due to so many reasons.
But its eﬀect on the overall predictability of the system would be minimal. If
however, the residual FPS encloses a substantial power from the actual rainfall
spectrum, the ﬂuctuations could be catastrophic.
In this study, the results indicate that the perturbations produced by the
environment on the rainfall pattern of Kerala state in India is minimal and that
there is no evidence to envisage a signiﬁcant deviation from the rainfall patterns
prevailing here.
The general outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we present a brief
outline of the Adaptive Basis Function Neural Network (ABFNN), a variant of

rainfall pattern.

the popular Back-Propagation algorithm. In section 3, the experimental set up
is explained followed by the results and concluding remarks in section 4.

Adaptive Basis Function Neural Networks

It was shown in [2] that a variant of the Back-Propagation algorithm (backprop)
known as the Adaptive Basis Function Neural Network performs better than the
standard backprop networks in complex problems. The ABFNN works on the
principle that the neural network always attempts to map the target space in
terms of its basis functions or node functions. In standard backprop networks,
this function is a ﬁxed sigmoid function that can map between zero and plus one
or between minus one and plus one the input applied to it from minus inﬁnity to
plus inﬁnity. It has many attractive properties that make the backprop an eﬃcient tool in a wide variety of applications. However serious studies conducted on
the backprop algorithm have shown that in spite of its widespread acceptance,
it systematically outperforms other classiﬁcation procedures only when the targeted space has a sigmoidal shape [3]. This implies that one should choose a basis
function such that the network may represent the target space as a nested sum
of products of the input parameters in terms of the basis function. The ABFNN
thus starts with the standard sigmoid basis function and alters its nonlinearity
by an algorithm similar to the weight update algorithm used in backprop.
Instead of the standard sigmoid function, ABFNN opts for a variable sigmoid
function deﬁned as
a + tanh(x)
(1)
Of =
1+a
Here a is a control parameter that is initially set to unity and is modiﬁed along
with the connection weights along the negative gradient of the error function. It
is claimed in [2] that such a modiﬁcation could improve the speed and accuracy
with which the network could approximate the target space.
The error function is computed as:
E=

� (Ok − O∗ )2
k

2

k

(2)

with Ok representing the network output and Ok∗ representing the target output
value.
With the introduction of the control parameter, the learning algorithm may
be summarized by the following update rules. It is assumed that each node, k,
has an independent node function represented by ak . For the output layer nodes,
the updating is done by means of the equation:
Δak = −β (Ok − Ok∗ )

1 − Ok
1 + ak

(3)

where β is a constant which is identical to the learning parameter in the weight
update procedure used by backprop.

For the ﬁrst hidden layer nodes, the updating is done in accordance with the
equation:
Δak−1 = −

�
i

wij β (Ok − Ok∗ ) (1 − Ok ) [(1 + ak ) + Ok (1 + ak )]

∂Ok
∂Ok−1

(4)

Here wij is the connection weight for the propagation of the output from node
i to node j in the subsequent layer in the network.
The introduction of the control parameter results in a slight modiﬁcation to
the weight update rule (Δwij ) in the computation of the second partial derivative
∂O
term ∂Ijj in:
dE
∂E ∂Oj ∂Ij
= −β

Δwij = −β
dwij
∂Oj ∂Ij ∂wij
as:
∂Oj
= [(1 − aj ) + (1 + aj ) Oj ] (1 − Oj )
(6)
∂Ij
The algorithm does not impose any limiting values for the parameter a and it is
assumed that care is taken to avoid division by zero.

Experimental Setup

In pace with the global interest in climatology, there has been a rapid updating
of resources in India also to access and process climatological database. There
are various data acquisition centers in the country that record daily rainfall along
with other measures such as sea surface pressure, temperature etc. that are of
interest to climatological processing. These centers are also associated to the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The database used for this study
was provided by the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of Cochin University
of Science and Technology, a leading partner in the nation wide climatological
study centers.
The database consists data corresponding to the total rainfall in each month
of Trivandrum city in Kerala, situated at latitude-longitude pairs (8o 29� N 76o 57� E). Although the rainfall data from 1842 were recorded, there were many
missing values in between that we had to restrict to periods for which a continuous time series was available. This was obtained for the period from 1893 to
1980.
For training our network, the monthly rainfall database from 1893 to 1933
was used. This corresponds to the ﬁrst 480 data samples in the database. Since
rainfall has an yearly periodicity, we started with a network having 12 input
nodes each with the corresponding month’s total rainfall as input. It was observed that the network accuracy increases systematically as we increased the
number of input nodes from 12 to 48 covering the data of 4 years. The training RMS error in this case went as low as 0.0001 in about 3000 iterations. Any
increase in input nodes resulted in poorer representations. However, the performance of the network on the remaining test data was found to be poor due to

404

over ﬁtting in the training data. This happened because of the large number of
free parameters in the network compared to the size of the training set. Further
experimentation showed that it is not necessary to input the data of all the
twelve months of the previous 4 years, but, four sets of 3 months data centered
over the predicted month of the ﬁfth year in the 4 previous years will give good
generalization properties. We thus ﬁnalized our network with 12 input nodes
each for the 3 months input data over 4 years, 7 hidden nodes and one output
node. In this way, based on the information from the four previous years around
the targeted month, the network is to predict the amount of rain to be expected
in the same month of the ﬁfth year.
The training was carried out until the RMS error stabilized to around 0.085
over the training data(40 years from 1893-1933). The ABFNN converged to this
value in around 350 iterations starting from random weight values.
After training, testing was carried out independently on the remaing test
data set. For generating the diﬀerence diagram, the data corresponding to the
entire 87 years of rainfall in Trivandrum city was presented to the network.
The diﬀerence of the output produced by the network to the actual rainfall in
each month was computed and plotted. This diagram enables one to make an
easy estimate of the error levels in both the training and test periods. For a
quantitative estimate of generalization error on the independent test set, the
power spectrum of the output produced by the network was subtracted from the
power spectra of the actual rainfall data in those months. This residual spectra
was then compared with the spectral diﬀerences between the actual patterns
in the training and test periods. In a dynamic system, there will always be
some residual spectra. But if the network could generalize well and capture the
dynamics in the training data, the output produced by it with the input from the
test period will be more identical to the actual pattern. This means, the residual
spectra will contain lesser residual power. If this power is less than the power
contained in the diﬀerence between the spectra of the training and test periods
of the actual rainfall patterns, it indicates that the deviations are not due to
any new phenomenon, but are due to the trends that existed from the training
period itself. Now the concern is the power content of the residual spectra. The
lower the power enclosed in this residual spectra, the better is the learning and
the generalization. The advantage of the scheme is that it provides a platform
for comparing the performance of various networks with ease and allows one to
visualize the spectral components that have actually deviated.

Results and Discussion

In ﬁgure 1 we show the diﬀerence pattern produced by the network over the
entire 87 year period on the Trivandrum database. The training period is also
shown. It may be noted that the deviations of the predicted signal from the
actual in the entire dataset falls within the same magnitude range. The root
mean square error on the independent test dataset was found to be around 0.09.

Fig. 1. The deviation of the predicted sequence from the actual time series data is
shown. It may be noted that the deviations in the training period and the rest of the
series are comparable in magnitude. The larger spikes are mainly due to the delay in the
actual commencement of the monsoon or cyclone. Label 1 indicates an example where
the monsoon extended into the following month giving more rainfall than anticipated.
Label 2 in the ﬁgure represent an example where the monsoon was actually delayed
by one month than was anticipated thus producing two spikes, one negative and the
other positive. Label 3 corresponds to a negative spike caused by the change in trend
from the predicted increase in rain in the following year.

Fig. 2. An overlap of the predicted and the actual time series data in the region
corresponding to the spikes in ﬁgure 1 is shown. The labels indicate the reason for the
spikes seen in ﬁgure 1.

where the rainfall was delayed with reference to the month for which it was
predicted are shown in ﬁgure 2.
The cause for the negative spike in ﬁgure 1 is also seen in ﬁgure 2 as due
to the deviation of the time series from the predicted upward trend. Factors
such as the El-Nino southern oscillations (ENSO) resulting from the pressure
oscillations between the tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean
and their quasi periodic oscillations are observed to be the major cause of these
deviations in the rainfall patterns[4].

Fig. 3. The Fourier power spectra corresponding to the actual and the predicted
rainfall for the entire 87 years. The sampling frequency does not have much signiﬁcance
here since the sample values represent the total rain received in each month. It was
taken to be twelve to associate itself with the 12 months of the year. Since FPS is
symmetric over half the sampling frequency, we show here only values from 0 to 6.

To obtain a quantitative appreciation of the learning algorithm, we resort to
the spectroscopic analysis of the predicted and actual time series. The average
power per sample distributed in the two sequences are shown in ﬁgure 3. It is seen
that the two spectra compare very well. We show the deviation of the FPS of the
predicted rainfall data from the actual in the test period in ﬁgure 4(top). The
second ﬁgure in ﬁgure 4 shows the deviation of the FPS of the actual rainfall data
in the test period from that corresponding to the training period. This residual
spectra indicates the deviation in periodicities and quantity of rainfall during
the test period as compared to that in the training period. But it is seen that in
the top ﬁgure most of the new frequency components visible in the second ﬁgure
are missing. From the scaling property of Fourier spectra, one knows that power
deviations in the spectra indicates deviations in the quanta of rainfall. Such
deviations are indicators of the error associated with the prediction and are
caused by the nonlinearity in the global factors that aﬀect rainfall. New trends,
or deviations of the existing rainfall pattern are identiﬁed by new frequency

Fig. 4. The residual FPS corresponding to the predicted and actual rainfall in the
years following the training period is shown on top. The spectral diﬀerence from a
Fourier analysis perspective (the diﬀerence of the FPS in the training period and the
period corresponding to the top ﬁgure) is presented in the bottom ﬁgure. Note that the
spectral diﬀerences are minimum in the top ﬁgure. This is to say that the deviations
observed in the actual spectra in the bottom ﬁgure followed from the trends that existed
in the training period.

components and not by the amplitudes of the component frequencies. The fact
that there are no major new frequency components in the top ﬁgure suggests
that the network could capture those trends seen in the second ﬁgure from the
training data itself and that the rainfall trend in the test period has not changed
considerably from the training period. In other words, it is to be concluded
that other than minor ﬂuctuations, the power factor in the residual FPS is
insigniﬁcant to expect any major deviations in the rainfall pattern prevailing in
the country.
The above discussion also shows that the ABF neural network is a better
tool than the popular Fourier analysis methods for predicting long term rainfall
behavior. The learning ability of the network can give a concise picture of the
actual system. Fourier spectra is a transformation from time domain to frequency
domain on the assumption that the time domain sequence is stationary. It thus
fails to represent the dynamics of the system which is inherent in most natural
phenomena and rainfall in particular.
A comparative study of the network with standard back-propagation network(BPNN) was also done. It was found that two hidden layers with 12 nodes
each were required for obtaining a comparable convergence in the BPNN. The
training and test errors after 1000 iterations were found to be respectively 0.954
and 0.948. It is to be noted that even with about three times more hidden nodes,
the BPNN is having a higher RMS error after training it for about two times as
much iterations used by ABFN. This clearly indicates that updating the basis
function makes sense in complex problems.
