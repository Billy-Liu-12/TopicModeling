Abstract. This paper presents a novel study on gas-like models for
economic systems. The interacting agents and the amount of exchanged
money at each trade are selected with diﬀerent levels of randomness,
from a purely random way to a more chaotic one. Depending on the
interaction rules, these statistical models can present diﬀerent asymptotic distributions of money in a community of individuals with a closed
economy.

Introduction

Econophysics is born as a new science devoted to study Economy and Financial
Markets with the traditional methods of Statistical Physics [1]. This discipline
applies many-body techniques developed in statistical mechanics to the understanding of self-organizing economic systems [2]. One of its main objectives is to
provide economists with new tools and new insights to deal with the complexity
arising in economic systems.
The seminal contributions in this ﬁeld [3], [4], [5] have to do with agentbased modeling and simulation. In these works, an ensemble of economic agents
in a closed economy is interpreted as a gas of interacting particles exchanging
money instead of energy. Despite randomness is an essential ingredient of these
models, they can reproduce the asymptotic distributions of money, wealth or
income found in real economic systems [2].
In the work presented here, the transfers between agents are not completely
random as in the traditional gas-like models. The authors introduce some degree
of determinism, and study its inﬂuence on the asymptotic wealth distribution in
the ensemble of interacting individuals. As reality seems to be not purely random
[6], the rules of agent selection and money transfers are selected with diﬀerent
levels of randomness and extended up to chaotic conditions. This unveils their
inﬂuence in the ﬁnal wealth distribution in diverse ways. This study records the
asymptotic wealth distributions displayed by all these scenarios of simulation.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the basic theory of gaslike economic models. Section 3 describes the four simulation scenarios studied in
this work, and the following sections show the results obtained in the simulations.
Conclusions are discussed in the ﬁnal section.

The Gas-Like Model: Boltzmann-Gibbs Distribution of
Money

The conjecture of a kinetic theory of (ideal) gas-like model for trading in market
was ﬁrst discussed in 1995 [7]. Then, it was in year 2000, when several noteworthy papers dealing with the distribution of money and wealth [3], [4], [5]
presented this theory in more detail.
The gas-like model for the distribution of money assimilates the dynamics of a
perfect gas, where particles exchange energy at every collision, with the dynamics
of an economic community, where individuals exchange money at every trade.
When both systems are closed and the magnitude of exchange is conserved,
the expected equilibrium distribution of these statistical systems may be the
exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution.
P (x) = ae−x/b

(1)

Here, a and b are constants related to the mean energy or money in the
system, a =< x >−1 and b =< x >. Theoretically, the derivation (and so the
signiﬁcance) of this distribution is based on the statistical behavior of the system
and on the conservation of the total magnitude of exchange. It can be obtained
from a maximum entropy condition [8] or from purely geometric considerations
on the equiprobability over all accessible states of the system [9].
Diﬀerent agent-based computer models of money transfer presenting an
asymptotic exponential wealth distribution can be found in the literature [3], [10]
, [11]. In these simulations, a community of N agents with an initial quantity
of money per agent, m0 , trade among them. The system is closed, hence the
total amount of money M is a constant (M = N ∗ m0 ). Then, a pair of agents
is selected (i, j) and a bit of money Δm is transferred from one to the other.
This process of exchange is repeated many times until statistical equilibrium is
reached and the ﬁnal asymptotic distribution of money is obtained.
In these models, the rule of agents selection in each transaction is chosen to be
random (no local preference or no intelligent agents). The money exchange Δm
at each time is basically considered under two possibilities : as a ﬁxed or as a random quantity. From an economic point of view, this means that agents are trading
products at a ﬁxed price or that prices (or products) can vary freely, respectively.
These models have in common that they generate a ﬁnal stationary distribution that is well ﬁtted by the exponential function. Perhaps one would be
tempted to aﬃrm that this ﬁnal distribution is universal despite the diﬀerent
rules for the money exchange, but this is not the case as it can be seen in [3], [10].

Simulation Scenarios

Real economic transactions are driven by some speciﬁc interest (or proﬁt) between the diﬀerent interacting parts. Thus, on one hand, markets are not purely
random. On the other hand, the everyday life shows us the unpredictable component of real economy. Hence, we can sustain that the short-time dynamics

Economic Models with Chaotic Money Exchange

45

of economic systems evolves under deterministic forces and, in the long term,
the recurrent crisis happening in these kind of systems show us the inherent
instability of them. Therefore, the prediction of the future situation of an economic system resembles somehow to the weather prediction. We can conclude
that determinism and unpredictability, the two essential components of chaotic
systems, take part in the evolution of economy and ﬁnancial markets.
Taking into account these evidences, the study of gas-like economic models
where money exchange can have some chaotic ingredient is an interesting possibility. In other words, one could consider an scenario where the selection rules
of agents and regulation of products prices in the market are less random and
more chaotic. Speciﬁcally, this paper considers the selection of interacting values
with diﬀerent levels of randomness up to chaotic regime.
In the computer simulations presented here, a community of N agents is given
with an initial equal quantity of money, m0 , for each agent. The total amount of
money, M = N ∗ m0 , is conserved in time. For each transaction, a pair of agents
(i, j) is selected, and an amount of money Δm is transferred from one to the
other. In this work two simple and well known rules are used. Both consider a
variable υ in the interval (0, 1), not necessarily random, in the following way:
– Rule 1: the agents undergo an exchange of money, in a way that agent
i ends up with a υ-dependent portion of the total of two agents money,
(υ ∗ (mi + mj )), and agent j takes the rest ((1 − υ) ∗ (mi + mj )) [10].
– Rule 2: an υ-dependent portion of the average amount of the two agents
money, Δm = υ ∗ (mi + mj )/2, is taken from i and given to j [3]. If i doesn’t
have enough money, the transfer doesn’t take place.
As there are two diﬀerent simulation parameters involved in these gas-like
models (the parameter for selecting the agents involved in the exchanges and the
parameter deﬁning the economic transactions), four diﬀerent scenarios can be
obtained depending on the random-like or chaotic election of these parameters.
These scenarios are considered in the following sections and are described as:
–

Scenario
Scenario
Scenario
Scenario

I: random selection of agents with random money exchanges.
II: random selection of agents with chaotic money exchanges.
III: chaotic selection of agents with random money exchanges.
IV: chaotic selection of agents with chaotic money exchanges.

It is worthy to say at this point, that the words random and pseudo-random
are used in the same sense, where random refers to the stochastic character of
the process and pseudo-random refers to the computational simulation used to
produce the process. The pseudo-random and chaotic numbers are obtained with
two chaotic pseudo-random bit generators, selected to this purpose. Technical
details of these generators are fully described in [12] and [13], and are based
in two 2D chaotic systems: the H´enon Map and the Logistic Bimap. Interactive
animations of them can also be seen in [14].
The particular properties of these generators [12], [13] make them suitable
for the purpose of this study. They are able to produce pseudo-random and

46

chaotic patterns of numbers that can be used as parameters of the simulations.
Basically, these generators have two parts: the output of the chaotic maps is
used as input of a binary mixing block that randomizes the chaotic signals and
generates the ﬁnal random numbers. Then, on one side, it is possible to take
the exit of the chaotic blocks and produce chaotic sequences of numbers. On the
other side, they can generate a sequence of numbers with a gradual variation of
randomness by controlling a delay parameter P in the binary mixing block.
This last feature is obtained by varying the shift factor P (P > 1) in a way
that the lower its value, the worse is the random quality of the numbers generated. Speciﬁcally, there is also a Pmin (around 80) above which, the properties
of the generator can be considered of good random quality.
As an example to show this gradual variation of randomness, the generator
in [13] is used to produce diﬀerent binary sequences and initial conditions of
S2 (further details [13]). These bits are transformed in integers of 32 bits and
transformed to ﬂoats dividing by the constant M AXIN T = 4294967295.
When the shift factor P is varied, the random quality of these binary sequences
also varies. This can be statistically measured by submitting them to statistical
tests and it can be also graphically observed in Fig.1.

The quality of their randomness improves as the shift factor P grows in magnitude.
(a) P = 1 (b) P = 5 (c) P = 110.

In Fig.1, we generated 640000 bits to obtain 20000 integers of 32 bits. The integers obtained from the generator are transformed to ﬂoats. The variation of the
shift factor shows graphically that with no shift at all, P = 1, the integers obtained
are hardly random. With P = 5, the bits generated do not pass the frequency or
monobit test and still show a strong no random appearance. When the shift factor
grows over P = 110, the binary sequences pass Diehard and NIST statistical tests.
Graphically in Fig.1(d), it can be assessed to possess high random quality.

Money Exchange

In this section, both simulation parameters are selected to obey certain pseudorandom patterns. Thus, the generators in [13] is used to produce diﬀerent binary

sequences (with initial conditions of S2 see further details in [13]). These bits
are transformed in integers of 32 bits and used as simulation parameters to select
the agents or the money to exchange.
Then, computer simulations are performed in the following manner. A community of N = 500 agents is considered with an initial quantity of money of
m0 = 1000$. For each transaction two integer numbers are selected from the
generated pseudo-random sequence with a given shift factor P = PAg . A pair of
agents (i, j) is selected according to these integers with an N -modulus operation.
Additionally, a third integer number is obtained from another pseudo-random
sequence with another shift factor P = PEx . This integer is used to obtain a ﬂoat
number υ in the interval [0, 1]. The value of υ and the rule selected (Rule 1 or
Rule 2) for the exchange determine the amount of money Δm that is transferred
from one agent to the other.
Choosing P = PAg with diﬀerent values it is possible to emulate an environment where the agents are locally selected under a more or less random scenario
situation. The same for P = PEx , the prices of products or services in the market
can be emulated to be less random, regulated, or completely arbitrary.

The simulations take a total time of 400000 transactions. Two rules of money
exchange were considered, Rule 1 and 2 described in Section 2. The results
show that all cases, independently of the value of the shift factor, produce a
stationary distribution that is well ﬁtted to the exponential function. In Fig. 2,
some particular cases are shown, taking pseudo-random selection of agents or
pseudo-random calculation of Δm. Although not depicted in Fig. 2 the case,
where both agents and traded money are selected randomly, gives very similar
results to the cases shown here and also similar to the ones obtained in [3].

Scenario II: Random Selection of Agents with Chaotic

In the previous section, it is observed that a variation in the random degree of
selection of agents and/or traded money, does not aﬀect the ﬁnal equilibrium

distribution of money. It leads to an exponential in all cases. In this section, the
selection of agents is going to be set to random, while the exchange of money
is going to be forced to evolve according to chaotic patterns. Economically, this
means that the exchange of money has a deterministic component, although it
varies chaotically. Put it in another way, the prices of products and services are
not completely random. On the other side, the interaction between agents is
arbitrary, as they are randomly chosen.
Let us take the chaotic pseudo-random generators a step backwards, directly
at the output of the chaotic block with initial conditions S2 and R1 (see [13]
and [12] respectively, for details). Now the chaotic map variables xi and yi
can be used as simulation parameters. Consequently, the computer simulations
are performed in the following manner. A community of N = 500 agents is
considered with an initial quantity of money of m0 = 1000$. For each transaction
two random numbers from a standard random generator are used to select a pair
of agents. Additionally, a chaotic ﬂoat number is produced to obtain the ﬂoat
number υ in the interval [0, 1]. The value of υ is calculated as |xi |/1.5 for the
H´enon map and as xi for the Logistic Bimap. This value and the rule selected
for the exchange determine the amount of money Δm that is transferred from
one agent to the other.
The simulations take a total time of 400000 transactions. Diﬀerent cases are
considered, taking the H´enon chaotic map or the Logistic Bimap. Rules 1 and 2
are also considered. New features appear in this scenario. These can be observed
in Fig.3.

trade points from the Logistic Bimap used in the simulations and represented as pairs
in the range [0, 1] × [0, 1].

The ﬁrst feature is that the chaotic behavior of υ (see Fig.3 (c) ) is producing a
diﬀerent ﬁnal distribution for each rule. Rule 2 is still displaying the exponential
shape, but Rule 1 gives a diﬀerent asymptotic function distribution. It presents
a very low proportion of the population in the state of poorness, and a high
percentage of it in the middle of the richness scale, near to the value of the mean
wealth. Rule 1 seems to lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth.

Economic Models with Chaotic Money Exchange

49

Basically, this is due to the fact that Rule 2 is asymmetric. Each transaction of
Rule 2 represents an agent i trying to buy a product to agent j and consequently
agent i always ends with the same o less money. On the contrary, Rule 1 is
symmetric and in each interaction both agents (i, j), as in a joint venture, end
up with a division of their total wealth. Now, think in the following situation:
with a ﬁxed υ, let say υ = 0.5, Rule 1 will end up with all agents having the
same money as in the beginning, m0 = 1000$. Using a chaotic evolution of υ
means restricting its value to a deﬁned region, that of the chaotic attractor.
Consequently, this is enlarging the distribution around the initial value of 1000$
but it does not go to the exponential as in the random case [10].

6

Scenario III: Chaotic Selection of Agents with Random
Money Exchange

In this section, the selection of agents is going to evolve chaotically, while the
exchange of money is random. Economically, this means that the locality of the
agents or their preferences to exchange are somehow deterministic but under
complex evolution. Thus, some commercial relations are going to be restricted.
On the other hand, regulation of prices is random and they are evolving freely.
The chaotic generators are used directly at the output of the chaotic block,
exactly as in the previous section. Again a community of N = 500 agents with
initial money of m0 = 1000$ is taken and the chaotic map variables xi and yi
will be used as simulation parameters. For each transaction two chaotic ﬂoats in
the interval [0, 1] are produced. The value of these ﬂoats are |xi |/1.5 and |yi |/0.4
for the H´enon map and xi and yi for the Logistic Bimap. These values are used
to obtain i and j as in previous section. Additionally, a random number from a
standard random generator are used to obtain the ﬂoat number υ in the interval
[0, 1]. The value of υ and the selected rule determine the amount of money Δm
that is transferred from one agent to the other.
The simulations take a total time of 400000 transactions. Diﬀerent cases are
considered, taking the H´enon chaotic map or the Logistic Bimap, and Rules 1
and 2. As a result, an interesting point appears in this scenario with both rules.
This is the high number of agents that keep their initial money in Fig. 4(a) and
(b). The reason is that they don’t exchange money at all. The chaotic numbers
used to choose the interacting agents are forcing trades between a deterministic
group of them and hence some commercial relations result restricted.
In can be observed in Fig. 4(a) and (b), that the asymptotic distributions
in this scenario again resemble the exponential function. The Logistic Bimap is
symmetric (coordinates xi and yi ) and it produces the eﬀect of behaving like
scenario II but with a restricted number of agents.
Amazingly, the H´enon Map with Rule 2 in Fig. 4(c) leads to a distribution
with a heavy tail, a Pareto like distribution. A high proportion of the population
(around 420 agents) ﬁnish in the state of poorness. Though not completely shown
in this ﬁgure, there are a minority of agents with great fortunes distributed up
to the range of 40000$. This is due to the asymmetry of the rule, where agent

i always decrements its money, and the asymmetry of coordinates xi and yi in
the H´enon chaotic Map used for the selection of agents. This double asymmetry
makes some agents prone to loose in the majority of the transactions, while a
few others always win.

7

Scenario IV: Chaotic Selection of Agents with Chaotic
Money Exchange

In this section, the selection of agents and the exchange of money are chaotic.
Economically, this means that commercial relations are complex and some transactions are restricted. The money exchange varies disorderly, but in a more deterministic way. The prices of products and services are not completely random.
As in the previous sections, the chaotic generators are used directly at the
output of the chaotic block. Again the chaotic map variables, xi and yi , will be
used as simulation parameters. The computer simulations are performed in the
following manner. A community of N = 500 agents is considered with an initial
quantity of money of m0 = 1000$. For each transaction, four chaotic ﬂoats in
the interval [0, 1] are produced. Two of these ﬂoats are |xi |/1.5 and |xi+1 |/1.5
for the H´enon map or xi and yi for the Logistic Bimap. These values are used to
obtain i and j through simple multiplication (i.e.: i = xi ∗ N + 1). Additionally,
a chaotic ﬂoat number is produced to obtain the ﬂoat number υ in the interval
[0, 1]. The value of υ is calculated as (|yi | + |yi+1 |)/0.8 for the H´enon map or
as (xi+1 + yi+1 )/2 for the Logistic Bimap. This value and the selected rule of
exchange determine the money Δm that is transferred between agents.
The simulations take a total time of 400000 transactions. Also, in this scenario,
we take the H´enon chaotic map or the Logistic Bimap, and Rules 1 and 2 are
considered. As a result, the same properties of both asymptotic distributions
are maintained respect to section 5, then the same diﬀerences between rules are
observed, as shown in Fig.5
Here, again a high number of agents keep their initial money. The chaotic
choice in Fig.5 (c) is forcing trades between a speciﬁc group of agents, and then

this type of locality makes some commercial relations restricted. The diﬀerent
behavior for Rule 1 and 2 is similar to scenario III. Rule 2 still presents an exponential shape, but Rule 1 gives a diﬀerent function distribution with a maximum
near the mean wealth. We remark that Rule 1 is able to generate a more equitable society when chaotic mechanisms are implemented in both processes, the
agents selection and the money transfer.

Conclusions

The work presented here focuses on the statistical distribution of money in a
community of individuals with a closed economy, where agents exchange their
money under certain evolution laws. The several theoretical models and practical
simulation results in this ﬁeld, implement rules where the interacting agents or
the money exchange between them are traditionally selected as ﬁxed or random
parameters ( [2], [4], [10]).
Here, a novel perspective is introduced. As reality tends to be more complex than
purely ﬁxed or random, it seems interesting to consider chaotic driving forces in
the evolution of the economic community. Therefore, a series of agent-based computational results has been presented, where the parameters of the simulations are
selected with diﬀerent levels of randomness and extended up to chaotic conditions.
In a ﬁrst scenario, the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is obtained
for two diﬀerent rules of money exchange under conditions with diﬀerent levels of
randomness. Consequently, this does not distinguish between diﬀerent evolution
rules and richness is shared among agents in an exponential and unequal mode.
Introducing chaotic parameters in three other diﬀerent scenarios leads to different results, in the sense that restriction of commercial relations is observed, as
well as a diﬀerent asymptotic wealth distribution depending on the rule of money
exchange. It is remarkable that a more equitable distribution of wealth is obtained
in one of the evolution rules when some of the dynamical parameters are driven by
a chaotic system. This can be qualitatively observed in the distributions of money
that have been obtained and reported for two diﬀerent scenarios.
