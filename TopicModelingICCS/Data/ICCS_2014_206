Abstract
The Fourier Grid Hamiltonian (FGH) method is used to compute the vibrational eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of bound states of diatomic molecu les. For these computations, the Hulburt and
Hirschfelder (HH) potential model for d iatomics is used. These potential energy functions are used
for constructing and diagonalizing the molecu lar Hamiltonians. The vibrational wave functions for
the ground and the excited states are used to calculate the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs), rCentroids and average internuclear separations which play a significant role in determining the
intensity of the bands in electronic transitions. The results of FCFs and r-Centroids for diato mic
mo lecules such as H2, N2, CO, I2 and HF using the FGH method are co mpared with other methods.
The Franck-Condon profiles indicate a strong correlation between the values of Franck-Condon
factors and the mean internuclear separations for the corresponding transitions.
Keywords: Franck-Condon factors (FCFs), r-Centroids, Hulburt and Hirschfelder (HH) five constant potential

1 Introduction
Kurti et. al.1 have formu lated and elegantly demonstrated the use of the Fourier Grid Hamiltonian
method (FGH). The high accuracy of the method has been demonstrated by estimat ing the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for bound states of H2 .1 The accuracy of the method can be enhanced
by an appropriate choice of the number of grid points, grid length and grid spacing.1, 2 The FGH
method is derived fro m the discrete variable representation method. 3 Kosloff4 solved the timedependent quantum mechanical p roblem by representing the Hamiltonian operator on a grid and
calculated the kinetic energy by the Fourier t ransform method. Sarkar et. al. 5 have used Fourier Grid
Hamiltonian method to calculate the vibrat ional eigenvalues of triato mic mo lecules. The Fourier
Grid Hamiltonian method has also been used to study the mult iphoton dissociatio n dynamics of
linear mo lecules.6 The intensities of the bands in the electronic spectra of d iatomics are governed by

The FCFs for all isotopomers of the hydrogen mo lecules have been co mputed using the latest
Born-Oppenheimer potential curves.10 Molecular n itrogen is the main co mponent of the air and
plays a crucial role in the atmospheric phenomenon such as aurorae and airglow. 11 The potential
energy curves and Franck-Condon factors of carbon mono xide have been computed. 12, 13 Absorption
and fluorescence of molecular iodine have been studied. 14 The coupled-cluster method has been
used to calculate spectroscopic constants and the potential energy curves for ground and exited
states of hydrogen fluoride molecule.15 Other experimental and theoretical investigations of FranckCondon factors for d iatomic mo lecules have also been reported. 16-23 The radiative transition
parameters such as the Franck-Condon factors, r-Centroids, electronic t ransition mo ments, Einstein
coefficients etc. have been calculated for many diatomic mo lecules such as ZrO, 24 Ag 225 and NO.26
We present briefly the FGH methodology in the next section. We then present the calculations on
H2 , N2 , CO, I2 and HF. This is followed by conclusions.

2 Methodology
In this section, we outline the main features of the FGH method.1 This is a numerical method
wherein the Hamiltonian mat rix elements are calcu lated at grid points which enco mpass the range of
distances that cover the motion of the atoms of the diatomic. Th is ensures that the vibrational
motion of the diato mics in several low lying vibrat ional states is well represented. The method can
be best described by using the Dirac bra and ket notation for representing state vectors in the
coordinate (

x

) and mo mentum (

k

) spaces.27 The potential energy is diagonal in the position

representation, while the kinetic energy is diagonal in the mo mentum representation. These
statements are represented by the following eqs.

where, G  x  x ' and G  k  k ' are Dirac delta functions in the position and momentum spaces
respectively, Vˆ is the potential energy operator, Tˆ is the kinetic energy operator,

We have used the FGH method for fo rming the Hamiltonian matrix. In the co mputational scheme, a
uniform grid spacing, Δx, is chosen. In the coordinate space,27 xi is defined as, xi = (i-1) Δx, i
=1…… n where n = nu mber of grid points. The total length of the grid is then l = (n-1) Δx. The
orthonormality condition on the coordinate grid is

In computing the FCFs, the vibrational wavefunctions for the states v'' (the ground electronic state)
and v' (the excited electronic state) need to be calculated. The grid length s in bohr are in the range
of 15 to 20 and the number of grid points used are 385 and 463. In the present paper, we have used

The FGH method also allows us to readily calculate the r-Centro ids and the mean internuclear
distances in different vibrational states. The r-Centroids (x,v"v’) represent the characteristic
internuclear separation of a v” to v’ transition in a diatomic molecular band system and are defined
by,35

The r-Centroid is a weighted mean of the internuclear d istance for the (v"-v') band and the weighting
function is ψv" ψv’. The weighting function can change sign over the integration range. The average
internuclear separation x v ' in the level v' can be defined as,

3 Results and Discussions
Using the potential energy curves, the eigenvalues of the vibrational Hamiltonian are calculated for
all the states mentioned in Tab le 1. The calculated eigenvalues are in good agreement with the
reported eigenvalues34-39 of these diatomic mo lecules. The agreement of our values with the reported
data fro m literature is very good especially for lower values of v ibrational quantum numbers. Using
the potential model of equation 8, Franck-Condon factors have been calculated fo r d ifferent band
systems of these diatomic mo lecules. Molecules were chosen ranging from H2 and N2 (narro w and
deep potential energy curves) to I2 (broad potential energy curve). Calculations for polar mo lecules
CO and HF have also been done. We have also compared the values obtained fro m the FGH method
with the values obtained for respective mo lecules using the Rydberg -Klein-Rees (RKR) method.29-39
The calculated values of the Franck Condon factors for N2 molecule for the X 1 Σ g + (v") − a 1 Пg (v')
band compare well with the reported values fro m reference 33. Our results for the Franck Condon
factors for CO mo lecule for the X1 Σ (v") - A 1 П (v') band co mpare well with the reported values
fro m reference 34. The calculated values of the Franck Condon factors for I2 mo lecule for the X 1 Σ +
(v") − B 3 Пo (v') band are compared with the reported values from reference 35. In general, the
overall agreement between the FGH the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) values of FCFs is very
satisfactory.
In a three d imensional representation of Franck-Condon profiles, one axis represents the vibrational
quantum numbers (v'') of one electronic state (usually the ground state) and another axis represents
the vibrational quantum nu mbers (v') for another electronic (excited) state and the third axis
represents the values of Franck-Condon factors (FCFs). In each figure, dark co lors represent very
low values of Franck-Condon factors and light/bright colors represent higher values of Franck-

Condon factors. As we go fro m dark to light colors, the values of FCFs increase. The mapping of
the values with colors in given in each figure. The local maxima of the FCF values lie
approximately along a parabola. In the following figures, we show the profiles of the FranckCondon factors and show the mean values of the internuclear separations for the states v" and v' next
to them.
The Franck-Condon profile for the X 1 Σ g + (v") − B 1 Σ u + (v') Ly man band of H2 mo lecule is shown in
Figure 1 (A). In Figure 1(B), the expectation values of xv " and xv ' are shown.

from Figure 1(B), we see that the values of xv " and xv ' are similar for both v' and v" in the range of 015. When v' or v" is greater than 10, the expectation values differ markedly for identical values of v'
and v". It can be observed from Figures 1(A) and 1(B) that the largest values of FCFs lie in the
region for which the range of v' is from 7 to 10 and v" is from 10 to 15 for the H2 molecule. In the
same region, the values of xv ' and xv " are close to each other. Similarly when v" is in the range of 0
to 5 and v' in the range of 8 to 12, the values of xv " and xv ' are comparable and the values of FCFs
between these states are also fairly large. It is found that in the other regions, where the FCFs values
are close to zero, there are appreciable differences in the values of xv ' and xv " . The highest value of
FCF is 0.48 and it is for v" = 14 to v' =8. The average internuclear separation xv" in the level v" = 14
is 2.00 Å. The average internuclear separation xv' in the level v' = 8 is 1.50 Å.
We have shown the Franck-Condon profiles for the X 1 Σ g + (v") − a 1 Пg (v') band of N2 molecule in
Figure 2 (A).

It can be seen from the Figure 2(A) that the largest values of FCFs lie in the reg ion for which the
range of v' is fro m 20 to 30 and v" is fro m 25 to 35 for N2 . In the same region, the values of xv ' and
xv " are also close to each other [Figure 2(B)]. In this region, the intensity of the band is high. It is
found that in the other regions, where the FCFs values are close to zero, there are significant
differences in the values of xv ' and xv " . The highest value of FCFs is 0.432 and it is for the v" =31

to v' = 23 transition. The average internuclear separation xv " in the level v" = 31 is 1.81 Å. The
average internuclear separation xv ' in the level v' = 23 is 1.37 Å. The Franck-Condon profiles and
mean internuclear d istances for CO, I2 and HF are shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5 respectively. For CO,
large values of FCFs are for v' is fro m 0 to 25 and v" is fro m 0 to 30. In the same range the values of
xv ' and xv " are close to each other. The maximu m value of FCF is 0.286 and it is for v" = 2 to v' =0
transition. The average internuclear separation xv " in the level v" = 2 is 1.35 Å. The average
internuclear separation xv ' in the level v' = 0 is 1.24 Å.

For I2 molecule that the large values of FCFs lie in the reg ion for wh ich the range of v' is fro m 20 to
30 and v" is fro m 45 to 55 [Figures 4(A) and 4(B)]. The highest value of FCFs is 0.148 and it is for
the v" = 51 to v' = 21 transition. The average internuclear separation xv " (v"=51) is 2.54 Å and that
of xv ' (v'=21) is 3.29 Å.
In the case of the B 1 Σ + (v") − X 1 Σ + (v') band of HF (Figure 5), large values of FCFs lie in the
region for which the range of v' is fro m 1 to 30 and v" is fro m 9 to 24. The highest value of FCFs is
0.47 and it is for the v" =19 to v' =4 transition. The average internuclear separation xv " in the level
v"=19 is 2.00 Å. The average internuclear separation xv ' in the level v' = 4 is 2.13 Å. We see that for
CO and HF, the xv " and xv ' are within 10% of each other at the respective FCFs maxima. For other
molecules of the present study, the corresponding differences are around 30%.
The r-Centro ids (xv', v", equation 11) represent the character istic internuclear separation of a v' to v"
transition in a d iatomic molecu lar band system. When the vibrational overlap integral (

³\

*
v'

\ v" dx

) is very small, then the r-Centroid can be very large or negative. When the value of r-Centroid is
very large, it exceeds the range of x where the value of wavefunctions is significant. When rCentroid is very large or negative, the band is very weak and practically insignificant. Our values of
r-Centroids for H2 molecu le for the X 1 Σ g + (v") − B 1 Σ u + (v') Ly man bands are 0.96 (0.96) fo r (v" = 0
and v' = 0), 0.80 (0.81) for (v" = 0 and v' = 7), 0.74 (0.76) for (v" = 0 and v' = 10), 0.96 (1.17) (v" =
1 and v' = 3), and 1.02 (1.12) for (v" = 2 and v' = 3). The values in brackets are fro m Ref [36].
Using the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) method. The calculated values of r-Centroids are found in
very good agreement with the reported values. 30-39 The calculation of the matrix elements of the
electronic transition mo ment Re(x), especially in its power series expansion in x (the internuclear
distance) can also be easily co mputed using the FGH method. The r-Centroid data for the other
mo lecules studied in this work can be made availab le as supporting information. There is reasonable
agreement with the FGH method and the other methods of calculations.

4 Conclusions
It is seen that the FGH method is an easy, elegant and effective method for calculating the
vibrational wave functions and the corresponding energy values for different electronic states of
diatomic mo lecules. By d iagonalizing the molecular Hamiltonians, we obtained the vibrational
eigenvalues and wavefunctions. The method works well for other potential models as well as the
digitized experimental potential energy data. We have shown that the Franck-Condon factors and rCentroids can be read ily computed for different band systems of diato mic mo lecules. The FGH
method compares quite well with the other methods such as the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR)
method. The values of xv " and xv ' (the average values of x in the corresponding vibrational states)
can be used to rationalize the structure of the profiles of the Franck-Condon factors and there is a
strong correlation between the t wo. Th is significant correlation between large values of FranckCondon factors and the nearness in the values of xv " and xv ' is a useful feature emerg ing out of
this study.
