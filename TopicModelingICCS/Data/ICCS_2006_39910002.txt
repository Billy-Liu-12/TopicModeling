Abstract. The Blue Gene project started in the final months of 1999. Five years
later, during the final months of 2004, the first Blue Gene/L machines were being installed at customers. By then, Blue Gene/L had already established itself
as the fastest computer in the planet, topping the TOP500 list with the breathtaking speed of over 70 Teraflops. Since the beginning of 2005, many other systems
have been installed at customers, the flagship machine at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory has greatly increased in size, and Blue Gene/L has established itself as a machine capable of breakthrough science. We here examine why
Blue Gene/L is such an effective science machine, and report on some of the
more significant research being performed by scientists using Blue Gene/L systems today. We also explain why this is just the beginning, and why there is more
excitement ahead of us than behind us in the Blue Gene project.
