in this line demonstrate [20][15] [5]. However, it is very difficult to quantify the importance of
compliance with ICM or to know what would happen if we stop applying them.
One of the mechanisms used to assess the efficacy of some medical procedures on transmission
rates are the Clinical Trials (CTs). The World Health Organization defines the CT as “Any
research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or
more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. Interventions
include, but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures,
radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care,
etc.”[13]. CTs should be based on a protocol or plan of action which describes what is done in
the study, how it is done and why each part of the study is necessary. All of these characteristics
define who participates in the CT (inclusion criteria: age, sex, presence of a particular disease,
among others). At times, it is not easy to ensure that the population studied meets all the
necessary characteristics, affecting both the quality of the results obtained and the increased
time and costs of conducting the CT. Moreover, CTs are always subject to the approval of
an ethics committee, which seeks to ensure that the study is ethical and the well-being of
the participants is protected at all times. In other words, in a real CT there will be certain
situations that cannot be considered because these are dangerous for patients.
This article proposes the use of a simulation tool, the MRSA-T-Simulator, to design and perform
“ Virtual Clinical Trials” (VCTs) for the purpose of studying MRSA contact transmission
among hospitalized patients. The VCT could be a cost-effective alternative in situations where,
due to ethical, economic or time limitations, it was difficult to design and implement a CT.
The validity of the simulation results would not be comparable to a real CT, but could offer
relevant information in those situations in which the CT cannot be performed or as a preimplementation situation.
The simulation began to be used in the 1970s as a tool for the solution of problems related to the
healthcare field. Issues such as the improvement in the planning of the configuration of HCWs,
the influence of the lengh of stay of patients in the hospital system, the optimization of resources,
or the transmission of diseases acquired in the healthcare environment have been widely studied
through the application of different techniques. Some simulations used mathematical models
to simulate aspects such as studying the impact of infection control programs on the spread
of MRSA [16], or to studying the transmission dynamics of MRSA [18][2]. Another simulation
technique is the Agent Based Model and Simulation (ABMS). This approach has the advantage
that it provides more flexibility when we need represent stochastic processes. There are several
studies that apply ABMS models to study MRSA transmission. For instance, in [11] an agentbased simulation to determine how the problem might be managed and the risk of transmission
reduced is developed. Another study [12] showed an individual-based model and simulator to
investigate MRSA outbreaks in a hospital ward. Additionally, ABMS approach has been used
to provide information to support decisions makers to healthcare services[8].
Simulation techniques have also been used to design CTs with different approaches. They can
help refine dose selection [1] [9] and study design, and to represent dose-response and timeresponse behaviour of safety and efficacy endpoints [14]. Some studies use preclinical data to
construct simulation models and to provide prior information on model parameters. Thus, the
results from a proof-of-concept study can be used to study a similar model to be used in a
subsequent study [19] [7].
As we can see, the use of simulation in the field of healthcare has multiple applications. From
its use as a tool to make decisions at the managerial level, to the development of simulations
of CTs related to the design of drugs and other applications. In our case, the main objective is
to show that a real CT can be replicated through the use of an ABMS simulation tool through

the appropriate parameterization of said tool. The ultimate goal is not to “replace” the real
CT, but to complement it, arriving through simulation, where the actual CT cannot arrive.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: In Section 2, some fundamental concepts
about CTs and our simulation tool are briefly reviewed. The process followed to desing VCTs
is explained in Section 3. Section 4 details some experimental results, and finally, Section 5
closes this paper with conclusions and future work.

Clinical Trial: Definition and Characteristics

As mentioned above, a CT is any research study that prospectively assigns human participants
or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health
outcomes[13]. All CTs are designed to answer a clinical problem or gain a new knowledge.
Since a CT is a study that involve humans, this is a carefully designed process. For a better
understanding, we have summarized the whole process in four steps: (1). The initial step is
the definition of the study objective. This objective will allow the approach of the hypothesis
that will be accepted or rejected at the end of the study. (2). Based on this hypothesis the
researchers will define the specific questions to be answered, which will determine other details
of the research such as the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study participants, the type of
CT (crossover, blind, double blind), the variables to be measured, the input data and what
variables to be considered as the output data are. (3). The next step is the implementation
of the study. Participants are selected on the basis of the inclusion criteria defined and their
consent to participate in the study is obtained. Then the samples and input data that the
study requires are taken (4). Finally, specialized personnel are responsible for the analysis of
the samples and the measurement and calculation of the output data (Fig. 1).
It is worth noting that patients who participate in a CT are volunteers. Also, it should
be considered that of the total population of patients, only those who meet the established
inclusion criteria will be chosen and only those who have given their consent will form part of
the study.

MRSA-T-Simulator: A tool to design virtual clinical trials

The MRSA-T-Simulator is a simulator of contact transmission of MRSA. This simulator was
developed with ABMS techniques[10]. The main feature of MRSA-T-Simulator allows us to
analyse the probability of transmission in each of the physical contacts which occur during
the process of normal care of a patient in a health service. Thus, we have a layer of health

system operation, where patients, HCWs and environment interact with each other and on
added to this, another one, the MRSA transmission layer in which every time a patient comes
into contact with an HCW or with the environment, the simulator analyzes if a transmission is
possible or not. Of course, the main condition is that one of the agents in contact is carrying
MRSA and the other is susceptible to acquire it. The agents are divided into active agents and
passive agents. Active agents are all people involve of the care process, patients and HCWs.
Passive agents are the objects and equipment of the medical environment and which have been
represented in the passive agent carebox (Fig. 2). It is assumed that all transmission event
results in a colonization or infection in the case of patients. Both colonization and infection
means that patient carrying MRSA, but only in the infection case the patient shows symptoms.
For HCWs, it is assumed that all transmission results in a temporary colonization (TC) or
permanent colonization(PC). TC means that a HCW carrying MRSA, but it can be eliminated
if HCW washes or disinfectes their hands. When an HCW is PC a hand washing or hand
disinfection action will not eliminate MRSA bacterium. If the agent who acquired MRSA
is the carebox, it is assumed that the carebox is contaminated and it could return to the
uncontaminated state only through a disinfection process carried out by the cleaning staff.
For the operation of the simulator, defining two sets of parameters is necessary (Fig. 3). The
first set corresponds to the Environment Configuration Parameters, and it includes: Input
Patient Configuration, Input Ward Facilities Configuration, Input HCW Configuration and
Input ICM Configuration. The second set corresponds to the internal variables that models
the probability of transmission between one agent who carrying MRSA and another agent
susceptible to acquire it. These are the Internal Transmission Variables and includes a
set of transmission coefficients that depends of who is the agent in risk to acquired MRSA.
The values used in each case will described in Section 3.2. A more detailed explanation of the
complete MRSA-T-Simulator model can be found in a previous publication[6].

Design the Virtual Clinical Trial

The process followed to obtain our VCTs is based on the fact that we have a tool to simulate
MRSA contact transmission, and this tool is highly configurable. Therefore, we are able to
calibrated the simulator through give values to Environment Configuration Parameters
and Internal Transmission Variables, such as described in Section 2.2. If our simulation
tool is able to reproduce the results shown in the real CT, we can conclude that the tool is
properly configured for the studied environment. Based on this configuration, we can make
some modifications, only on the Environment Configuration Parameters with the aim to
create other scenarios, simulate these, and obtain predictions. It is worth noting that Internal
Transmission Variables only change during the calibration process of the tool.

Source of Data: Clinical Trial in Hospital Ward

When working in simulated environments, it is very important to have input data from reliable
sources. In our case, considering that the purpose of this research is to adjust the simulation
tool developed to obtain VCTs, we have taken as a main data source the work of Roisin et al.

[17], which details step by step the design and execution of a cross-over trial to determine the
efficacy of a rapid MRSA screening test, which is called a PCR (Polymerase-chain reaction)
test compared to the culture test at the time of patients’ hospital admission. Therefore, the
total number of patients who participate in the study is divided into Intervention Case
(PCR test) and Control Case (Culture test). The data, which cannot be extracted from this
research, has been taken from other investigations. Table 1 summarizes a list of variables with
their respective values, which has been taken from Roisin et al [17]. These values are used
to generate the Environment Configuration Parameters for our simulation. The percentage of
MRSA acquisition obtained at the end of the study is also showed (MRSA-Acq). This MRSAAcq percentage will be the final value that we must obtain as the main data output of our
simulation.

Configuration of MRSA-T-Simulator. Parameters and Values

With the data provided in [17], we defined a first set of experiments with the aim of carrying out
the calibration process of our model. The specific values used for Environment Configuration
Parameters are defined in Table 2. In the case of the specific values used for the input HCW
configuration, we do not have data available about the number of doctors, nurses, auxiliary
staff or cleaning staff working in this environment, but we can define these values taking into
account the configurations used in similar heathcare environments [16], the attention time
(approximately) for each patient and the flow of patients into wards. We use the same HCW
configuration to simulate PCR and Culture Cases. The behavior of HCWs is determined by
the values of Input ICM Configuration. The patient population is defined by the Input Patient
Configuration. A parameter that is not describe in the study is the percentage of patients with
predisposition to acquire MRSA who arrive to the ED. For this parameter, we decided to use the
No. of surgical admissions (Table 1), because the surgical patients are especially susceptible
to acquiring MRSA. And finally, the ward facilities configuration have been established in such
a way that there is always a carebox available for a new patient and no queues are created.

Virtual Clinical Trials Results

All experiments were executed in parallel on 2-node cluster with 64 cores per compute node:
CPU AMD Opteron6262 HE. For each configuration 192 repetitions were carried out. The right
number of repetitions is defined based on statistical methods applying for a non-terminated
system[3] to achieve statistically meaningful results. We compute the average of total number
of repetitions for each scenario. A warm-up period of 2000 hours was defined to get the state
ready of the system. The simulation time was 8280 hours, corresponding to 11.5 months of real
CT duration. Principal outcome data for each repetition is the MRSA-Acq(%).

Stage 1: Reproducing a CT
Our model reproduces a stochastic process, where results depend on several factors such as the
initial parameters and the behavior of the agents. Therefore, setting a relative error value is necessary. This error determines a range of values for which the results will be valid. In this case,
we fixed the error permitted as MRSA-Acq ± σ. Where MRSA-Acq = 3.2% (percentage calculated respect to patients susceptible), and σ ±10%. Thus, the range of values is [2.88-3.52 ]%
for Intervention Case and [2.89-3.53 ]% for Control Case. Output data of VCTs are shown in
Table 4. As can be seen, the results for MRSA-Acq, both for Intervention and Control Case,
are within the correspondent error range. Therefore, we conclude that the MRSA-T-Simulator
is calibrated for the studied environment and it is able to design and execute VCTs with valid
results. These two simulated scenarios are the baseline to create new study scenarios.

Stage 2: Using MRSA-T-Simulator as predictive tool
The simulator allow us acquire new knowledge or respond a specific clinical problem through
the design and execution new VCTs. Such as a real CT, the VCT needs to answer a specific
question. Thus, we consider the following hypothetical case where HCWs demand to know
what is the minimum effective disinfection value of hands to generate an MRSA-Acq <4.5%.
We assumed for this VCT the same configuration of the Control Case. To answer this question,

we propose the execution of several VCTs in which the variable Hand Disinfection Effective takes
different values that allow us to determine what would be the sought value. It is important
to remark that, except this variable, the initial configuration of the simulation should not be
modified (Fig. 4). The range of values for Hand Disinfection Effective is [100 - 0 ]%. We know
that extreme cases, 100% and 0%, are not possible in a real environment; however these are
considered as part of the example to highlight differences between the two extreme cases. It can
be deduced that, as long as the percentage of effective disinfection of the hands remains within
the range [100, 70]%, MRSA-Acq will be less than 4.5%. However, when the hand disinfection
effective percentage drops below 70%, the percentage of patients who acquire MRSA reaches
the threshold. In a real environment, analysis of this type are not possible due to the ethical
implications that, non-compliance (premeditated) of ICMs by HCWs would entail.

Conclusions and Future Work
• We developed a model and a simulator of MRSA contact transmission, highly configurable,
using the ABMS approach. The simulator is a flexible tool that allow several configurations to the patients population, HCWs, and the ward facilities. This configuration is
achieved by giving specific values to the simulator variables.
• MRSA-T-Simulator allows us to replicate a real CT, in order to analyce and predict the
probably consequences that some changes in the design of the original CT could entail.
The results are obtained in a period of time less than a real CT. It allow us to avoid the
need to design and carry out a new CT.
• Our simulation tool helps us to design, execute and obtain results of VCTs which in real
life are not possible for ethical, economic or time reasons.
• As a future work, we plan to include the transmission of MRSA among HCWs to HCWs.
In addition, due to MRSA can be transmitted through physical contact, other passive
agents, such as electronic devices, could be introduced into the simulation model.
