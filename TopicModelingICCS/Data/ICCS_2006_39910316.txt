Abstract. A higher-order frequency-domain characterization of termite
activity (feeding and excavating) has been performed by means of analyzing diagonal slices of the bi-spectrum. Five sets of signals of diﬀerent
qualities were acquired using a high sensitivity probe-accelerometer. We
conclude that it is possible to establish a third-order pattern (spectral
track ) associated to the termite emissions, and resulting from the impulsive response of the sensor and the body or substratum through which
the emitted waves propagate.

Introduction

Termite detection has gained importance in the last decade mainly due to the
urgent necessity of avoiding the use of harming termiticides, and to the joint use
of new emerging techniques of detection and hormonal treatments, with the aim
of performing an early treatment of the infestation. A localized partial infestation
can be exterminated after two or three generations of these insects with the aid
of hormones [1],[2].
User-friendly equipment is being currently used in targeting subterranean infestations by means of temporal analysis. An acoustic-emission (AE) sensor or
an accelerometer is attached to the suspicious structure. Counting the hits produced by the insects and been registered by the accelerometer, the instrument
outputs light signals. At the same time, the user can listen to the sounds and
perform some pre-processing, like ﬁltering or amplifying. A set of hits is deﬁned as an acoustic event, which in fact constitutes the electronic tracks of the
insects.
These instruments are based on the calculation of the root mean square (RMS)
value of the vibratory waveform. The use of the RMS value can be justiﬁed both
by the diﬃculty of working with raw AE signals in the high-frequency range,
and the scarce information about sources and propagation properties of the
AE waves. Noisy media and anisotropy makes even harder the implementation

of new methods of calculation and measurement procedures. A more sophisticated family of instruments make use of spectral analysis and digital ﬁltering [3]. Both have the drawback of the relative high cost and their practical
limitations.
In fact, the usefulness of the above prior-art acoustic techniques and equipments depends very much on several biophysical factors. The main one is the
amount of distortion and attenuation as the sound travels through the soil (∼600
dB m−1 , compared with 0.008 dB m−1 in the air) [1]. Furthermore, soil and wood
are far from being ideal propagation media because of their high anisotropy, nonhomogeneity and frequency dependent attenuation characteristics [3].
On the other hand, second order statistics and power spectra estimation (the
second order spectrum) fail in low SNR conditions even with ad hoc piezoelectric
sensors. Spectrum estimation and spectrogram extract time-frequency features,
but ignoring phase properties of the signals. Besides, second-order algorithms
are very sensitive to noise.
Other prior-art second-order tools, like wavelets and wavelet packets (timedependent technique) concentrate on transients and non-stationary movements,
making possible the detection of singularities and sharp transitions, by means
of sub-band decomposition. The method has been proved under controlled laboratory conditions, up to a SNR=-30 dB [4].
As an alternative, higher order statistics (HOS), like the bi-spectrum, have
proven useful for characterization of termites’ emissions, using a synthetics of
alarm signals and prior-known symmetrically-distributed noise processes [5],[6].
The conclusions of these works were funded in the advantages of cumulants;
in particular, in the capability of enhancing the SNR of a signal buried in
symmetrically distributed noise processes. The computational cost paid is the
main drawback of the technique. Besides, in the practice the goal is to localize the infestation from weak evidences, in order to prevent greater destruction.
For this reason it should be emphasized that non-audible signals have to be
detected.
In this paper third-order spectra slices are used to characterize termite emissions. The results help the HOS researcher to better understand the higher-order
frequency diagrams; in particular in the ﬁeld of insect characterization by AE signal processing. The conclusions are based in records which were acquired within
the surrounding perimeter of the infestation. The quality of the signals has been
established using the criteria of audibility and the levels of quantization used in
the digitalizing process by the data acquisition equipment. The accelerometer
used is the SP1-L probe from AED2000 instrument, with a high sensitivity and
a short band-width.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the problem of
acoustic detection of termites; Section 3 recalls the theoretical background of
HOS, focussing on the computational tools. Experiments are drawn in Section
4, which is intended as a tool to interpret results from HOS-based experiments.
Finally, conclusions are explained in Section 5.

Acoustic Detection of Termites

AE is deﬁned as the class of phenomena whereby transient elastic waves are
generated by the rapid (and spontaneous) release of energy from localized sources
within a material, or the transient elastic wave(s) so generated. This energy
travels through the material as a stress wave and is typically detected using a
piezoelectric transducer, which converts the surface displacement (vibrations) to
an electrical signal [4].
Termites use a sophisticated system of vibratory long distance alarm described, among others in, [1]. In [4] is is shown one of the impulses within a
typical four-impulse burst (alarm signals) and its associated power spectrum
of the specie (reticulitermes lucifugus). The carrier frequency of the drumming
signal is deﬁned as the main spectral component.
We are concerned about the spectral patterns of the signals; so we do not
care about the energy levels. Besides, as a result of the HOS processing, the
original energy levels of the signals are lost, but not as the extent of the levels
of parasitic noise which are coupled to the signals. Furthermore, the amplitudes
of the noise processes, which could be coupled to the waveform under study,
are signiﬁcatively reduced if the probability density function of the stochastic
process is symmetrically distributed [5].
Signals from feeding an excavating do not exhibit a concrete time pattern
(bursts and impulses equally spaced). They comprise random impulse events
that provoke the same response of the sensor and the traversed media. The main
handicap is the low intensity of the involved levels. We are concerned about
detecting activity by rejecting noise.
In the following we settle the mathematical foundations of HOS for the characterization process.

Higher-Order Statistics (HOS)

The motivation of the poly-spectral analysis is three fold: (a) To suppress
Gaussian noise processes of unknown spectral characteristics; the bi-spectrum
also suppress noise with symmetrical probability distribution, (b) to reconstruct
the magnitude and phase response of systems, and (c) to detect and characterize
nonlinearities in time series.
Before cumulants, non-Gaussian processes were treated as if they were
Gaussian. Cumulants and their associated Fourier transforms, known as polyspectra [7], reveal information about amplitude and phase, whereas second order
statistics (variance, covariance and power spectra) are phase-blind [8].
The relationship among the cumulants of stochastic signals, xi , and their
moments can be calculated by using the Leonov-Shiryayev formula. The second-,
third-, and fourth-order cumulants are given by [5], [8] equation 1:
Cum(x1 , x2 ) = E{x1 · x2 }.

(1a)

Cum(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = E{x1 · x2 · x3 }.

(1b)

Cum(x1 , x2 , x3 ,x4 ) = E{x1 · x2 · x3 · x4 }
− E{x1 · x2 }E{x3 · x4 }
− E{x1 · x3 }E{x2 · x4 }
− E{x1 · x4 }E{x2 · x3 }.

(1c)

In the case of non-zero mean variables xi have to be replaced by xi -E{xi }.
Let {x(t)} be a r th-order stationary random real-valued process. The r thorder cumulant is deﬁned as the joint r th-order cumulant of the random variables
x(t), x(t+τ1 ),. . . , x(t+τr−1 ),
Cr,x (τ1 , τ2 , . . . , τr−1 )
= Cum[x(t), x(t + τ1 ), . . . , x(t + τr−1 )].

(2)

The second-, third- and fourth-order cumulants of zero-mean x(t) can be expressed using equations 1 and 2, via:
C2,x (τ ) = E{x(t) · x(t + τ )}.

(3a)

C3,x (τ1 , τ2 ) = E{x(t) · x(t + τ1 ) · x(t + τ2 )}.

(3c)

− C2,x (τ2 )C2,x (τ3 − τ1 )
− C2,x (τ3 )C2,x (τ1 − τ2 ).
We assume that the cumulants satisfy the bounding condition given in equation 4:
τr−1 =+∞

τ1 =+∞

···
τ1 =−∞

|Cr,x (τ1 , τ2 , . . . , τr−1 )| < ∞.

(4)

τr−1 =−∞

The higher-order spectra are usually deﬁned in terms of the r th-order cumulants as their (r -1)-dimensional Fourier transforms

The special poly-spectra derived from equation 5 are power spectrum (r =2),
bi-spectrum (r =3) and try-spectrum (r =4). Only power spectrum is real, the
others are complex magnitudes. Poly-spectra are multidimensional functions

which comprise a lot of information. As a consequence, their computation may be
impractical in some cases. To extract useful information one-dimensional slices
of cumulant sequences and spectra, and bi-frequency planes are employed in
non-Gaussian stationary processes [6].
Once summarized the foundations of the experiment, hereinafter we present
que results obtained by means of the tools described here.

Experimental Results

The data acquisition stage took place in a residential area of the “Costa del Sol”
(M´
alaga-Spain), at the beginning of the reproductive season of the termites. The
sensors were attached (plunged) in the soil surrounding aﬀected trees (above the
roots). We worked under the hypothesis of having a 500 m-radius of an aﬀected
circular perimeter.
The probe SP1-L from the equipment AED2000 has been taken as the reference with a twofold purpose. First, we analyze the power spectra of signals with
diﬀerent qualities, to decide wether it is possible to use second-order spectra
for identiﬁcation purposes. Secondly, we settle down a higher-order detection
criterion in the frequency domain which it is supposed to enhance detection.

Signals have been previously high-pass ﬁltered in order to suppress low frequency components which would mask the higher-frequency components. A 5thorder Butterworth digital ﬁlter with cut-oﬀ frequency of 2 kHz is used.
Each graph is the result of averaging a number of 15, 2500-sample registers
from reticulitermes lucifugus feeding activity. Figure 1 shows the average power
spectra of six signal categories according to their amplitude quantization levels.
These AE signals were acquired by the sensor SP1-L, using a sampling frequency
of 64 kHz and a resolution of 16 bits. These spectra are compared with the background in order to establish an identiﬁcation criterion. Vibrations of qualities D
and E are inaudible.
Quality-A (Q-A) signals’ amplitudes belong to the quantization levels interval
[25000,30000]. Q-B levels are in [15000, 20000]. Q-C levels are in [10000, 15000].
Quality-D levels are in the interval [5000, 10000]. Finally, Q-E impulses are completely buried in the background. We are sure about the infestation, so the AE
events in this series are due to termite activity, probably in a 3 meter-radius
subset within the area under study.
The two main frequency components in the spectra of Figure 1 appear at 6 and
15 kHz, respectively, which are associated with the frequency response of the
sensor, to the features of the sounds produced by the termite species and to the
characteristics of the substratum, through which the emissions propagate. We
conclude that using the probe SP1-L we can detect an infestation by interpreting
the power spectra diagrams. This is due to the diﬀerences that the emissions
exhibit in comparison with the ﬂatter shape of the background spectra (sixth
column of graphs in Figure 1).
The calculation of 3th-order spectra is performed with a twofold purpose. The
ﬁrst objective is to enhance the detection criteria in the frequency domain. The
second purpose is to use more economic sensors, with a lower sensitivity and a
higher band-width. Figure 2 shows the average diagonal bi-spectra associated
with the signals acquired with the probe SP1-L. A maximum lag χ = 512 was
selected to compute the third-order auto-cumulants of the signals. The bottom
bi-spectrum characterizes the background sound (the most unfavorable, with an
amplitude lower in four orders of magnitude than Q-A).
The main frequency component in Figure 2 (6 kHz) permits to establish
a detection criterion based on the identiﬁcation of this maximum value. It is
remarkable that this frequency is also associated with the sensor. Another sensor
would display another bi-spectrum shape. For this reason the proposed method
of insect detection is based on the prior characterization of the transducer. On
the other hand, the magnitudes of the bi-spectra in Figure 2 don’t suﬀer a
dramatic attenuation from high to low levels (two orders from Q-A to Q-E).
This fact reinforces the criterion of identiﬁcation, in the sense that it is the
noise (symmetrically distributed) which is mainly reduced in the higher-order
computation.
On the basis of these results we establish the conclusions related to the identiﬁcation criterion proposed.

Conclusions

In this work it has been shown that the diagonal slices of the bi-spectrum are
valid and convenient tools for obtaining decision criteria to distinguish a possible
infestation, based on the feeding activities of the termites. We have funded this
conclusion on three arguments:
First, higher-order cumulants and spectra, as deﬁned herein, enable the signal
analysis procedure to have access to waveform information that is typically unavailable when using prior art (second-order) methods. In particular, we remark
the enhancement of the frequency diagrams. This is due to the rejection exerted
on symmetrically distributed noise processes. In fact, non-Gaussian processes
are completely characterized by means of HOS.
Secondly, the potentially valuable information contained in an AE signal (most
part of its spectrum) is related to the impulses. The average spectrum reveals amplitude information (the resonance peaks) but phase information is not shown.
Higher-order spectra are arrangements of complex numbers and contain this
additional information which can be valuable in a pattern recognition or identiﬁcation criterion context.

Finally, using diﬀerent sensors the criterion changes the frequency set-point.
Besides, the probability of a false alarm is very low, considering the fact that we
had to provide, intentionally, the worst case of background noise. Repeatability
has been estimated in a 75 per cent.
Future work is focussed on reducing the computational complexity of HOS
in two directions. On one side, we are using compact functions, like FFT and
FFTshift. Secondly, we have to adopt a compromise between the maximum lag
(χ) and the resolution, in order to save storage memory and time. These actions
are oriented to implement the algorithms in a digital signal processor, in an
autonomous hand-instrument.
