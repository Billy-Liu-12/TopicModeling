Abstract. We consider the problem of analyzing inﬂuences in ﬁnancial
networks by studying correlations in stock price movements of companies
in the S&P 500 index and measures of inﬂuence that can be attributed to
each company. We demonstrate that under a novel and natural measure
of inﬂuence involving cross-correlations of stock market returns and market capitalization, the resulting network of ﬁnancial inﬂuences is Scale
Free. This is further corroborated by the existence of an intuitive set
of highly inﬂuential hub nodes in the network. Finally, it is also shown
that companies that have been deleted from the S&P 500 index had low
values of inﬂuence.

Introduction

In a stock market, individual companies are inﬂuenced by each other. The nature
and measure of the inﬂuence of a company on another depends on various factors
including their sectors of operation, direct buyer-seller relation, acquisition, etc.
A quantity that measures the direct inﬂuence among companies is the relationship between their stock price changes. This can be measured using the pairwise
correlations of the two stock prices averaged over a time window. Analysis of such
correlations, usually using matrices, is a well studied topic in computational ﬁnance. In this paper, following Kim et al [1], we pursue a graph theoretic approach
to obtain interesting structural properties in this correlation matrix. A weighted
discrete graph is constructed with the nodes representing the companies and the
weight of the edge between two companies equals the correlation. The analysis is
carried out on this graph.
Scale free graphs and networks have generated a lot of interest lately. A graph
is said to be scale free if the degree sequence of the graph follows a power law
- the probability that a vertex has k neighbors is proportional to k γ . Scale free
networks show up in a large number of real world scenarios, especially large
complex networks. For example, it is shown in [2] that the scale free property
applies to the world wide web graph consisting of documents as vertices, two

documents being connected if a hyperlink points one document to the other.
Many social and business networks are also scale free [3]. In nature, one ﬁnds
that cellular metabolic networks and protein interaction networks are scale free
[4, 5]. Scale free networks have some interesting properties. There are a few nodes
with very high degree of connectivity - called hubs. Most nodes on the other
hand have very few neighbors. A computer network that is scale free would be
resistant to random security attacks, but would be vulnerable to planned attacks
on the hubs, see [6]. A popular theoretical model for the evolution of scale free
networks uses the notion of preferential attachment and growth - a new vertex
that is added attaches itself, with higher probability, to vertices that are already
highly connected. See [7, 8, 9].
In this paper, we study the network of companies in the S&P 500 index. [1]
used cross correlations as the metric and deﬁned the inﬂuence of a company as
the absolute sum of the crosscorrelations involving the company and conjectured
that the resulting inﬂuence graph would be scale free. Here, note that the graph is
a weighted fully connected graph and scale free refers to the existence of a power
law governing the set of inﬂuences. Our analysis of similar data shows that under
the measure in [1] the companies with the largest inﬂuence tended to all come
out of the same sector, namely, semiconductor sector and included many relatively smaller companies. We present a novel alternate measure involving cross
correlations and market capitalization under which the S&P 500 inﬂuence network is scale free. Also, the list of companies with large inﬂuence is intuitive. We
also examine the companies that have been deleted from the index in 2004-2005
and observe that the deleted ones indeed had low inﬂuence over a period of time.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the details of
the data used. Section 3 discusses the diﬀerent measures of inﬂuence and analyzes the results obtained. Finally, section 4 summarizes the results and provides
direction for further work.

Data

The daily stock price data, adjusted for splits and dividends, for S&P 500 companies from 1994 to 2005 was downloaded from the website www.ﬁnance.yahoo.com.
Only companies that remained in the index from 1994 to 2004 were considered for
the main part of the analysis. The ﬁnal experiments were done for 416 companies
that remained after data cleaning. The market capitalization values for these companies were downloaded for a particular day in July 2005 as a representative value.
We calculated the cross correlations and inﬂuence values over the period 1994 to
2005 for various window sizes ranging from 3 months to 4 years. In this paper, we
present some representative results.

Analysis and Results

Let the stock price of company i(i = 1, ..., N ) at time t be Yi (t). The return of
the stock price after a time-interval Δt is given by

18

N. Arora, B. Narayanan, and S. Paul

Si (t) = ln Yi (t + Δt) − ln Yi (t),

(1)

meaning the geometrical change of Yi (t) during the interval Δt. We take Δt = 1
day for the following analysis. The cross-correlations between individual stocks
are considered in terms of a matrix C, whose elements are given as
Ci,j =

< Si Sj > − < Si >< Sj >
(< Si2 > − < Si >2 )(< Sj2 > − < Sj >2 )

,

(2)

where the brackets mean a temporal average over the period we studied. Then
Ci,j can vary between [−1, 1], where Ci,j = 1(−1) means that two companies
i and j are completely positively(negatively) correlated, while Ci,j = 0 means
that they are uncorrelated. It is known that the distribution of the coeﬃcients
{Ci,j } is a bellshaped curve, and the mean value of the distribution is slowly
time-dependent, while the standard deviation is almost constant. The timedependence of the mean value might be caused by external economic environments such as bank interest, inﬂation index, exchange rate, etc, which ﬂuctuates
from time to time. To extract intrinsic properties of the correlations in stock
price changes, we look at the following quantity as in [1],
Gi (t) = Si (t) −

N

Si (t),

(3)

i

where Gi (t) indicates the relative return of a company i to its mean value over
the entire set of N companies at time t. The cross-correlation coeﬃcients are
redeﬁned in terms of Gi ,
< Gi Gj > − < Gi >< Gj >

wi,j =
(<

G2i

> − < Gi >2 )(< G2j > − < Gj >2 )

.

(4)

To check that the distribution P (w) is time-independent, [1] looked at P (w)
by taking temporal average in equation (4) over each year from 1993 to 1997.
The distribution of {wi,j } for the period 1994 − 1997 are shown in Figure 1 and
match the distribution obtained by [1].
Let us now look at the weighted graph deﬁned as follows - the vertices of the
graph are individual companies, each pair (i, j) of vertices has an edge between
them with an associated weight ei,j . The value ei,j represents the inﬂuence that
the companies exert on each other. The total inﬂuence strength si of company
i can then be deﬁned as the sum of the weights on the edges incident upon the
vertex i, that is,
ei,j ,
(5)
si =
j

What will be a good way to calculate ei,j ? Does it depend only on the crosscorrelation coeﬃcients? Should the inﬂuence of company i on j be the same as
that of j on i? [1] took ei,j = wi,j in the above deﬁnition of inﬂuence strength
(note that it is symmetric). For them,

We obtained the values wi,j using stock prices of S&P 500 companies over a
period of 4 years(1994-1997). It was observed that the deﬁnition in (6) assigns the
highest values of inﬂuence strengths to companies such as AMAT, PMCS, KLAC,
XLNX, LSI - surprisingly all of them in the semiconductor sector, while the
companies such as GE, JNJ, PG, XOM and MSFT all landed in lower inﬂuence
region (the symbols used for companies can be looked up for company name at
www.ﬁnance.yahoo.com). Upon analysis, it was inferred that this was caused by
a strong correlation between semiconductor companies, which in some cases was
as high as 0.6, a very rare value otherwise. The typical graph of the distribution
P (|s|) of the inﬂuence strength |s| looked like in Figure 2.
Above observations suggest using the values of market capitalizations of individual companies while calculating the inﬂuence strengths. We ﬁrst attempted
the following formula to calculate si ,
wi,j × Mj ,

si =

(7)

j

where Mj is the market capitalization of company j. That is, the inﬂuence of two
companies A and B on the market should not be the same value if A exerts high
inﬂuence on bigger companies but B exerts high inﬂuence on smaller companies.
Also, for the case j = i(wi,j = 1), we are adding the market capitalization of
company i to si which makes intuitive sense. This deﬁnition of inﬂuence strength
moved many of the bigger companies to the top. The most inﬂuential companies
given by this formula are shown in Table 1. The inﬂuence strength was calculated
using a window of size two years(2003-04).

Scale Free Network

We now propose our ﬁnal measure. To motivate, let us calculate the inﬂuence
of company i on the market in two steps. The symmetric measure of cross correlation wi,j between i and j can not be interpreted as inﬂuence of i on j as
well as the inﬂuence of j on i. This is too simplistic. Suppose a company i with
market capitalization Mi (∼ 1B) is supplying a raw material to a manufacturer
j with market capitalization Mj (∼ 300B). Suppose further that the stock price
of i is correlated to that of j with wi,j (∼ 0.2). We propose that the inﬂuence
i
exerted by i on j, denoted Inf l(i → j), is wi,j × MiM
+Mj . Similarly deﬁne the
inﬂuence by j on i. Now to calculate the inﬂuence of i on the market we will sum

Fig. 3. Plot of the inﬂuence strength distribution P (|s|) versus the absolute value of the
inﬂuence strength |s| as given by equation (8)(in double-logarithmic scales). We looked
at the stock returns for two years 2003-2004. P (|s|) denotes the number of companies
with inﬂuence s ± 25

over all companies j the value of inﬂuence of i on j multiplied by the market
capitalization of j. This gives
Inf l(i → j) × Mj =

This deﬁnition of inﬂuence strength gives a much more satisfactory ranking
to companies. The top 10 companies are shown in Table 2.
Moreover, the plot of inﬂuence strength distribution P (|s|) as a function of |s|
follows a power-law, P (|s|) ∼ |s|−δ , with δ ≈ 2.2. See Figure 3. Thus the network
of inﬂuences among these companies is indeed scale free. The outliers towards
the high inﬂuence region may be attributed to extremely dominant companies
in separate sectors. In particular, note that P (|s|) in these cases is small.
Comparison of the Walt Disney Co and Texas Instruments Inc(both with
market capitalization ∼ 50B) calculated over various 6 month windows between
2001 and 2004 shows that our measure does not give undue importance to market
capitalization (See Figure 4).

Deletion

Finally, we looked at some companies that were deleted from the S&P 500 recently, namely, American Greetings(Apr ’04), Thomas and Belts(Aug ’04), Worthington Industries(Dec ’04) and Deluxe Corp.(Dec ’04). Figure 5 shows the
inﬂuence strength of these companies for the eight half-yearly periods between
Feb 2001 and Feb 2005. A downward trend in their inﬂuence strengths just be-

Conclusion

We demonstrate a weighted scale free network of inﬂuences that exists among
S&P 500 companies. We have come up with a measure for the inﬂuence of a
company on another as well as on the whole market by utilizing cross-correlations

Financial Inﬂuences and Scale-Free Networks

on movements of stock prices as well as market capitalization. Our deﬁnition for
the inﬂuence strength is observed to intuitively give a satisfactory ranking to
the S&P 500 companies and can also explain the deletion of companies from this
index in the period from 2004 to 2005. Some open questions include analysis of
other ﬁnancial networks, analysis of the theoretical models for scale free networks
in this context. An important problem is to derive methods of risk analysis for
ﬁnance, supply chain and other domains incorporating concepts from the theory
of scale free networks.
