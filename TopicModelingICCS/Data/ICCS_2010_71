Abstract
The gating mechanism of ionic channels in cardiac cells is often modeled by ordinary diﬀerential equations
(ODEs) with voltage dependent rates of change. Some of these rate functions contain discontinuities or singularities, which are not physiologically founded but rather introduced to ﬁt experimental data. Such non-smooth right
hand sides of ODEs are associated with potential problems when the equations are solved numerically, in the form
of reduced order of accuracy and inconsistent convergence. In this paper we propose to replace the discontinuous
rates with smooth versions, by ﬁtting functions of the form introduced by Noble (1962) to the original data found by
Ebihara and Johnson (1980). We ﬁnd that eliminating the discontinuities in the rate functions enables the numerical
method to obtain the expected order of accuracy, and has a negligible eﬀect on the kinetics of the membrane model.

1. Introduction
Describing the electrophysiology of cardiac cells by mathematical models has been subject to investigation for
several decades. A central element of the mathematical formulation is the gating mechanism, i.e., how ion channels
open and close in response to changes in the membrane potential. Hodgkin and Huxley [1] laid a foundation for
describing the gating mechanism, and this formulation is still widely used in models of cardiac cells. The HodgkinHuxley model describes the opening and closing of the gates as ﬁrst order reactions with voltage dependent rate
functions of sigmoidal shape. A similar formulation of the rate functions was used by Noble [2] to describe impulse
propagation in Purkinje cells, and later adopted by Beeler and Reuter in their ventricular cell model [3].
Early experimental techniques were not suﬃciently reﬁned to properly record the dynamics of the fast inward
sodium current, and hence the upstroke of the action potential was not accurately reconstructed in the ﬁrst generation
of membrane models. These models therefore tend to under-estimate the upstroke velocity of the action potential,
which also leads to an under-estimated propagation velocity in cardiac tissue simulations, see, e.g., [4]. Improved
experimental techniques introduced in the 1970s enabled a more detailed study of sodium current dynamics, and this
was utilized by Ebihara et al. [5] in a study on chick embryonic myocytes. They found that the kinetics of the sodium

channel was much faster than anticipated previously, and proposed a new set of rate functions to improve the model
description. The new rate functions contained discontinuities, which appear to be motivated purely from providing
the best possible ﬁt to experimental data, and not by any physiological arguments. The discontinuous rates introduced
in [5] have later been adopted by a number of authors, and are present in cell models such as the family of Luo-Rudy
models [6, 7], the human atrial model of Courtemanche et al [8], the canine model of Winslow et al [9], and the rabbit
model of Shannon et al [10], to mention a few.
Generally, when solving an ODE system
y = f (y)
with a numerical method, the formal convergence order of the solver will be corrupted if there are discontinuities
in the right hand side function f . This is discussed in detail by Shampine [11], who suggests that, if possible, any
discontinuous right hand side should be replaced by a smooth version. The motivation for this replacement is not to
provide a more correct model, but one that is easier to solve with the desired accuracy.
In the present paper we apply this approach to the rate functions of the sodium channel, and propose smooth rate
functions on the original form introduced by Noble [2], ﬁtted to the data from [5]. Through numerical experiments
we show that the changed rates give virtually no visible eﬀect on the behavior of the gate variables or the membrane
potential, and that the convergence properties are improved compared to the discontinuous versions. The improved
convergence may not be very important for single cell electrophysiology simulations, but results presented in [12]
indicate that there may be substantial beneﬁts from using high order solvers for tissue level simulations. Since high
order of convergence is impossible to obtain for the discontinuous rates, the smoothed version may oﬀer signiﬁcant
computational beneﬁts.
2. Mathematical models
2.1. The Ebihara-Johnson sodium current model
Ebihara et al. [5, 13] used a sodium current formulation similar to the one introduced in [3];
INa = gNa m3 h j(v − E Na ),

(1)

where the gating variables obey ODEs on the form
dw
= αw (1 − w) − βw w,
dt

w = m, h, j.

(2)

Here, αw and βw , w = m, h, j are respectively the opening and closing rates of a single gate. We here focus on the
inactivation and reactivation gates h and j, because this is where we ﬁnd the discontinuous rates. For the inactivation
gate h, the rate functions are given by

Note that we have left out the unit of v (mV) in these and all subsequent equations. Similarly, the opening and closing
rates for j read

We see that all these functions contain a jump at v = −40mV. As noted above, these rate functions are present in a
large number of recent cell models, see for instance [6, 7, 9, 8, 10].
2.2. A smooth version of the Ebihara-Johnson model
As mentioned above, our aim is to approximate (3)-(6) by smooth functions. As a natural starting point, we choose
the general form introduced by Noble;
αw (v), βw (v) =

c1 ec2 (v−c6 ) + c3 (v − c6 )
,
c4 ec5 (v−c6 ) + 1

w = h, j,

and seek parameters c1 , . . . , c6 that ﬁt the experimental data of [5].

We use a Matlab curve-ﬁt tool to adjust these new functions to data obtained from the original rates given by
(3)-(6).
The input function to the curve-ﬁt tool is speciﬁed according to (7), and the parameters c1 , . . . , c6 are received as
output from the least squares method. Table 1 shows the parameter values for the opening and closing rates of the
inactivation process of INa . There is a computational advantage in putting all rates on this form in that the rates can
be implemented as a general function which takes the parameters collected in arrays as input. Figure 1 shows plots of
the new rate functions (solid lines) for v within the normal physiological range, together with the original functions
by Ebihara and Johnson (dotted lines). As can be observed, the deviations from the original functions are minimal,
which is also reﬂected in the gate variables as shown in Figure 2.
3. Numerical experiments
To illustrate the eﬀect of discontinuities in cell models on the convergence rate of higher order numerical methods,
we shall in this section apply the second order solver from [14] to the Luo-Rudy 1991 model [6] (LR1). Convergence
results with and without the new rate functions are compared. We run the simulations for time t ∈ [0, 10]ms, with
initial conditions given in Table 2, and denote the solution at t = 10ms by uΔ . Since it is not possible to ﬁnd
an analytical solution to the LR1 model, we calculate an extremely ﬁne solution set with a built-in Matlab solver,
ode15s, and let the solution at time t = 10ms, denoted by u, serve as reference solution. Then we calculate the
l2 -norm deﬁned by
u − uΔ

to Ebihara et al. Here we tried a reference solution both with and without event handling, see e.g. [11], with no

new rates give second order convergence as expected for the numerical method. Figure 3 shows the transmembrane
potential for the two sets of rate functions. Note that there is no visible diﬀerence in the action potential shape.
4. Conclusion
In this paper we have proposed smooth versions of the rate functions that describe the inactivation process of INa ,
present in many widely used models of cardiac cell electrophysiology. The problem with the original rate functions is
that they contain discontinuities that are not physiologically motivated, and that potentially destroy the convergence
of high-order numerical methods.
The smoothed rate functions are compared with the original versions by visible inspections of rate functions, gate
variables and action potential shape. From these preliminary inspections one may conclude that the new formulation
gives a good approximation to the original model, and is therefore applicable for practical simulations. However, this
remains to be throroughly veriﬁed through quantitative comparisons in a more realistic setting.
Moreover, the new formulation will only be beneﬁtial when using high order ODE solvers, as ﬁrst order convergence is obtained both for the smooth and discontinous model formulations. Previous studies [12] indicate that using
second order solvers for tissue simulations give improved eﬃciency. However, further investigations are needed before
one may conclude that combining smoothed rate functions with high order solvers gives a signiﬁcant computational
improvement.
