Effect of small molecules onElias
Tg Mahmoudinezhad et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017)
Mahmoudinezhad
et al.
265–271

One of the major issues here regards the effect of environment on thermal and mechanical
properties of polymers [Marquardt et al. , 2016]. Under usual conditions, polymer materials
are in contact with a gas or liquid environment and are thus subject to the penetration of
small molecules. The incorporation of small molecules can alter the mechanical properties of
polymers strongly. In the case of plasticizers in e.g. PVC, this is desired and necessary. On
the other hand, the uncontrolled take-up of low molecular substances by polymers may lead to
a degradation of the material and reduce its service life time.
A way to quantify this effect is a survey of the glass transition temperature and its dependence on the concentration of small molecules diffused into the polymer sample. The
present work focuses on this issue via molecular dynamics simulations of a generic polymer
model [Baschnagel & Varnik, 2005]. Results obtained from simulations are also compared to
experimental measurements. Despite the simplicity of the investigated model, qualitative trends
observed in the present computer simulations agree well with experimental results.
The paper is organized as follows. In the following section, the model is introduced. Section 3 compiles the results and a discussion thereof. A brief summary and outlook closes the
manuscript.

Model

A generic model of polymer with finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential has been
employed during present simulations [Kremer & Grest, 1990], which allows to focus on generic
rather than materials specific aspects. Small molecules are introduced as spherical particles.
All particle pairs interact via a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential,
LJ

(rαβ ) = 4ǫαβ [(

σαβ 12

) −(
) ],

where α, β ∈ {p, s}, and p and s stand for polymer and small molecules, respectively. The
LJ potential is truncated and shifted to zero at a cutoff radius of rc = 2 × 21/6 σαβ . σpp = 1
is chosen as the unit of length. The diameter of small molecules is chosen to be half of the
monomer diameter, σss = 0.5 and σsp is obtained as the arithmetic mean, σsp = 0.5(σpp + σss ).
The energy scale of the Lennard-Jones potential is chosen to be independent of the particle
type, i.e. ǫpp = ǫss = ǫsp = 1. The connectivity of covalent bonds along the chain’s backbone is
ensured by a finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential [Kremer & Grest, 1990],

where k = 30ǫpp /σpp
is the strength factor and R0 = 1.5σpp the breaking limit of covalent bonds.
The superposition of the FENE and the LJ potentials prevents monomers from overlapping
while establishing a steep bonding potential with an equilibrium bond length of b ≈ 0.96σpp .
It is important to note that this preferred bond length is incompatible with the length scale
preferred by the LJ potential for non-bonded interactions, rmin,LJ ≈ 1.12. This leads to a
geometric frustration and facilitates glass formation [Varnik et al. , 2002].
The chain length (number of monomers per chain) is set to Np = 64 which is larger than the
entanglement length of the model (Ne ≈ 32 [Baschnagel & Varnik, 2005]). Figure 1 illustrates
the model and shows a snapshot of the simulation cell.

Results and Discussion

The preparation of the configurations for the present study requires great care. As illustrated
in Fig. 1d, at the very beginning, polymers and small molecules are arranged on a regular
lattice and simulations are performed at constant temperature and pressure for a sufficiently
long time in order to allow the polymer to melt and reach the corresponding equilibrium state.
The temperature at this initial stage is set to T = 1ǫpp /kB so that the thermodynamic driving
force from the initial regular structure to the disordered liquid is not too high in order to avoid
numerical instabilities. Once the liquid state is reached, the temperature is increased in order
to enhance the dynamic of structural relaxation. This step is useful for an efficient generation
of statistically independent samples since the structural relaxation time, which determines the
time scale between independent samples, decreases with T . The extracted configurations are
cooled to T = 1ǫpp /kB and are equilibrated at this temperature. Samples prepared in this way

and the volume is allowed
are then cooled at a constant rate of Ṫ = 10−4 at p = 1ǫpp /σpp
to fluctuate. The glass transition temperature is then determined by analyzing the recorded
system volume versus temperature.
In order to avoid undesired effects of the preparation history on Tg , we first make sure
that equilibrium state is reached prior to cooling simulations. This is achieved by a survey of
the dynamics of structural relaxation, exemplified by the mean square displacements and the
autocorrelation function of the chain’s end-to-end vector. A survey of these two quantities is
shown in Fig. 2, providing evidence that the statistical independence of the samples is indeed
ensured.
Using the prepared configurations, the polymer-small particle mixture is cooled under constant pressure at a rate of Ṫ = 10−4 (LJ units) and system volume, energy, etc are recorded. A
survey of the system volume versus temperature shows two linear regimes corresponding to the
high-temperature liquid and the low-temperature solid states. The slopes of these lines gives the
expansion coefficient in the corresponding liquid and solid states. Following a well-established
empirical rule, one uses the intersection point of these two straight lines to define the glass
transition temperature. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Applying the above described procedure, we have performed an extensive set of simulations
of polymer-small particle mixtures at different concentrations of small molecules and have thus
determined the effect of small molecules on the glass transition temperature. The results of
these simulations are depicted in Fig. 4a and clearly show a decrease of the polymer-Tg with
number concentration, c, of small molecules. Here, c = Ns /Nall , where Ns is the number of small
molecules and Nall that of all particles (monomers+small molecules). The effect of spherical
particles in the present setup is thus a softening of the polymer matrix.
It is interesting to note that a model as simple as the present one is capable of reproducing
the trend observed in experiments on a the effect of different types of small molecules on the glass
transition temperature of a polyurethane-based shape memory polymer. Figure 4b illustrates
the experimental result obtained for three different types of molecules, water, acetone and
ethanol. For all these molecules, the observed effect is a decrease of Tg . It is also interesting that

and small molecules are placed on a regular lattice. The initial pressure and temperature are
selected such that polymer-small particle mixture is in the liquid state but the thermodynamic

avoid numerical instabilities. Once the liquid state in reached, the temperature is increased in
order to enhance the dynamic of structural relaxation (pressure is kept constant at this and all

subsequent steps (p = 1ǫpp /σpp
)). This helps to reduce the time interval between statistically
independent samples and thus accelerates their generation from a single simulation run. The
independent samples extracted at this high temperature are then cooled to T = 1ǫpp /kB and
are equilibrated again at that temperature. This marks the end of sample preparation. Samples
prepared in this ways are then cooled at a relatively low cooling rate of Ṫ = 10−4 , during which
the system volume is recorded. The data obtained during this last cooling stage are used to
determine the glass transition temperature. Results obtained from statistically independent
runs allow a determination of the standard error in Tg .

Starting from a high temperature liquid state, the system temperature is gradually reduced

expansion coefficients in the high temperature liquid domain and in the low temperature solid
phase. The intersection of these two lines defines the glass transition point.

Summary and Outlook

In this work, we report on molecular dynamics simulation studies of the effect arising from
the presence of small molecules on the glass transition temperature of glassy polymers. The
work is motivated by the need to better understand the effect of environmental conditions on
polymer properties. Due to glassy nature of the polymers, special care is needed to prepare
well-equilibrated samples and to obtain reliable data. Our central result indicates a softening
of the polymer by small molecules. This softening is in striking agreement with experimental
observations. These results raise a number of interesting questions. An important issue here is
the effect of particle size and shape. On entropic grounds, the particle size is expected to play a
role here as the efficiency to use interstitial spaces decreases with increasing particle size. Also
the shape of particles may play a role in this context. Another issue regards the energetics.
In this study, all interaction parameters of the LJ potential were set to be equal so that no
preference was given to either monomer-monomer or monomer-small particle interactions. One
can intuitively expect that attractive interactions may have an effect opposite to what was
observed here and that repulsive forces would enhance the softening effect. These intuitive
ideas need to be carefully examined via simulations.
