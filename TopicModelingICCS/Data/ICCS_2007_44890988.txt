Abstract. Energy intensity(EI) is a commonly used index to estimate
energy eﬃciency(EE) for countries, but it neglects the speciﬁc structure
of energy consumption. We present a new index named weighted energy
intensity(WEI), where weights are computed by a linear programming
model named weighted energy intensity model(WEIM) and prove that it
is equal to CCR model in DEA with one-output system. A comparison
between WEI and EI is demonstrated. Results show that EI has underestimated EE of China and WEI is more accordant with real situation. We
also use malmquist index(MI) to analyze changes of EE, frontier technology and total factor productivity of China over period 2000-2003.
Keywords: Weighted energy intensity, Energy productivity, Energy
eﬃciency, DEA; Malmquist index.

Introduction

China has become the second greatest energy consumption country in the world.
According to BP Statistical Review of World Energy, Chinese primary energy
consumption increased by 15.1% in 2004. That’s much higher than world primary energy consumption’s 4.4%[1]. Energy intensity(EI) is a popular index to
estimate energy eﬃciency(EE) for a country, which is deﬁned as total energy
consumption relative to total output(GDP or GNP)[2]. Using energy intensity,
most researches support that EE of China is low. However, EI only considers
simple-sum of energy consumption as single input to produce GDP neglecting
structure of energy consumption. Usually, EI may overstate or understate energy eﬃciency. We present a new index named weighted energy intensity(WEI),
where weights are computed by weighted energy intensity model(WEIM). We
prove that WEIM is equal to CCR model in data envelopment analysis(DEA)
and can easily overcome that shortage of EI. The same as CCR model, WEIM is a
non-parametric approach that computes best practice eﬃcient frontiers based on
convex combinations of decision making units(DMUs) in the sample[3]. WEIM
requires few assumptions and get results more objectively than EI.
Section 2 shows sample selection, inputs and output. Section 3 introduces
WEI, WEIM, CCR and malmquist index(MI). WEIM is used to estimated EE
of China among 49 countries and MI is used to analyze total factor productivity
changes over the period 2000-2003 in section 4. Finally, we conclude.

Sample Selection, Inputs and Output

Two data sources are used, which are World Petroleum Yearbook[4] and International Statistical Yearbook[5]. Removing countries that didn’t satisfy our
sample selection criteria, we got 49 countries. They are United States, China,
Russia Federation, Japan, India, and so on.
Most researches about the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth focus on how the latter impacts the former. However, experience
has proved that it’s very important for energy to drive economic growth[6]. We
concentrate on production process where energy consumption is input and GDP
is output. Main primary energy consumption concludes oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear energy and hydropower. Oil and natural gas consumption are incorporated
as one input. Nuclear power and hydropower are also incorporated as another
input. Coal is the third input. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the only output. Therefore, we have three input indexes(million tones oil equivalents) and
one output index(100 million USD).

Methodology

Suppose that there are n countries to be evaluated. Each country consumes various amounts of m diﬀerent energy inputs to produce GDP. Speciﬁcally, country
j consumes amount xij of energy input i to produce amount yj of GDP. We assume that xij 0 and yj 0. WEI is deﬁned as weighted energy consumption
relative to total GDP. Weights are not selected subjectively, but through solving
a linear programming model named WEIM, speciﬁc form of which is as follows.
m

m

min ρ =

pi xi0 /y0
i=1

subject to

pi xij /yj ≥ 1(∀j), pi ≥ 0(∀i).

(1)

i=1

The target value of this model is WEI of country 0. pi represents weight of input
i. WEIM adopts a self-evaluation mechanism. Each country can get diﬀerent
combinations of p to maximize its WEI score.
Deﬁnition 1. Country 0 is WEI eﬃcient if there exists an optimal solution that
ρ∗ = 1 and p∗i > 0(∀i) .
DEA is a relatively data oriented approach for evaluating performance of
DMUs which convert multiple inputs into multiple outputs[3]. The following
CCR model[7], one of DEA models, is corresponding model for our research.

vi xij ≤ 1(∀j), u ≥ 0, vi ≥ 0(∀i). (2)

i=1

Deﬁnition 2. Country 0 is DEA eﬃcient if there exists an optimal solution
that θ∗ = 1 and u∗ > 0, vi∗ > 0(∀i).
Theorem 1. WEIM is equal to CCR model, and ρ∗ = 1/θ∗ , p∗i = vi∗ /u∗ (∀i).
Proof. Take reciprocal of θ and let pi = vi /u(∀i) in CCR model, then CCR model
can be easily turned into WEIM.

MI is an index representing total factor productivity growth of a DMU under
multiple inputs and multiple outputs framework. MI is deﬁned as the product of
”Catch-up” (CU) and ”Frontier-shift” (FS) terms. CU relates to the degree that
a DMU attains for improving its eﬃciency, while FS reﬂects the change in the
eﬃcient frontiers surrounding the DMU between the two time periods. M I > 1
indicates progress in total factor productivity, while M I = 1 and M I < 1
indicate respectively the status quo and decay in total factor productivity. CU
and FS have similar explanations with MI[3].

Results

This paper primarily focuses on China and compares China with other countries. We use WEIM to compute energy eﬃciency for 49 countries and compare
WEI with EI. To get a clear image of China, we just involve top ﬁve energy consumption countries among 49. Results are showed in Table 1. Using EI index,
China is one of the lowest EE countries, of which rank is 43 and EI is 831.47
toe/10000 USD. EI of Russia Federation is lower than China, but EI of other
three, including India, are higher than China. Main energy resource of China
is coal, which makes up of nearly 70% of its energy consumption. Most other
countries consume oil and natural gas. Usually, combustion eﬃciency of coal is
lower than other kinds of energy. EI neglects this speciﬁc characteristic of diﬀerent energy, but WEI can easily overcome this shortage. In WEIM, each country
get diﬀerent combinations of p to maximize its WEI score. Using WEI, rank of
China is upgraded from 43 to 32. EE of Russia Federation is lower than China,
while EE of United States and Japan are higher than China. Japan and United
States are developed countries, after two oil crisis, they have made great eﬀorts
to improve their EE. India is a fast developing country like China and its WEI
score is a little lower than China, which gives diﬀerent result from EI. EI index
has underestimated EE of China and WEI is more accordant with real situation.
Now let’s examine the energy productivity changes of China over period 20002003. Results are showed in Table 2. From year 2000 to year 2001, MI of China is
equal to 1.08, which implies slight progress in total factor productivity. The reason is high catch-up term of 1.20, which means great improvement in eﬃciency.
Frontier-shift term is lower than 1, so the eﬃciency frontier has withdrew back.
Not only for China, but also other four countries are confronted with regress

in the frontier technology. From year 2001 to year 2002, both catch-up and
frontier-shift term of China are higher than 1, which means eﬃciency frontier
moves upward and eﬃciency of China is improved, thus the MI is higher than 1.
From year 2002 to year 2003, MI of China is lower than 1, showing slight regress
in total factor productivity. Frontier-shift term is equal to 1.22, while catch-up
term of China is equal to 0.81 and that is lower than other four countries.

Conclusion

This study has presented a index named WEI which overcomes one shortage of
traditional energy intensity index and proved WEIM is equal to CCR model with
one output in DEA. Energy eﬃciency in 2003 and productivity of China over period 2000-2003 were analyzed using WEIM and MI methods with a three-inputs
and one-output system. Results showed that WEI were more accordant with the
real situation than EI and EI underestimated energy eﬃciency of China. Using
WEI, rank of China has been upgraded greatly. Evidences were also provided
that total factor productivity of China increased over 2000-2002, decreased a
little over 2002-2003, and increase rate over 2000-2002 was slow down.
Researches can be continued to do with this topic. This paper only considered
total GDP as single output. Structure of GDP can be involved. Having evaluated
the energy eﬃciency before, we can go on to forecast future eﬃciency trend.
