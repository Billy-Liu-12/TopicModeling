Abstract. In this paper the solution of one-phase inverse Stefan problem with Neumann’s boundary condition is presented. This problem consists of the reconstruction of the function which describes the heat ﬂux on
the boundary, when the position of the moving interface is well-known.
The proposed solution is based on the Adomian decomposition method
and the least square method.

Introduction

In this paper we solve the one-phase inverse Stefan problem, which consists of
the reconstruction of the function which describes the heat ﬂux on the boundary,
when the position of the moving interfaces is well-known. This kind of problem
becomes an inverse design problem. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of this problem are given in the literature [3]. The solution
is based on the Adomian decomposition method and the least square method.
The Adomian decomposition method was developed by G. Adomian [1, 2].
This method is useful for solving a wide class of problems [2, 4]. Using this
method we are able to solve non-linear operator equation:
F (u) = f

(1)

where F : H → G is a non-linear operator, f is a known element from Hilbert
space G and u is the sought element from Hilbert space H. Operator F (u) can
be written as:
F (u) = L(u) + R(u) + N (u) ,
(2)
where L is the invertible linear operator, R is the remaining linear operator
and N is a non-linear operator. The solution of the equation (1) is sought in the
form of a functional series:
∞

u=

gi .

i=0

After some manipulations we obtain the following recurrent formula:
g0 = g ∗ + L−1 (f ) ,
gn = −L−1 R(gn−1 ) − L−1 (An−1 ) ,

Inverse Stefan Problem

Let D ⊂ R2 be a domain (Figure 1). We seek an approximate solution of the
following problem:
For the given position of freezing front Γg , the distribution of temperature u
in domain D is calculated as well as function q(t) on boundary Γ1 , which satisﬁes
the following equations:

Solution of the Problem

In the problem under consideration we have operator equations (1), where:
L(u) =

∂2u
,
∂x2

R(u) = −

a ∂t

N (u) = 0 ,

f =0 .

The inverse operator L−1 is given by:

Hence, using the boundary condition (7) and (8) we obtain:
g0 (x, t) =

We seek an approximation solution in the form:
n

un (x, t) =

gi (x, t) ,

n∈N .

(12)

i=0

Because the gi (11) are dependent on the unknown function q(t), we derived this
function in the form:
m

q(t) =

pi ψi (t) ,

(13)

i=1

where pi ∈ R and the basis functions ψi (t) are linearly independent. The coeﬃcients pi are selected to show minimal deviation of function (12) from the
conditions (6) and (9) (considering the assumed measure). To construct the
measure of error the least square method is applied. Thus we seek the minimum
of the following functional:

Substituting equations (12), (11) and (13) to functional J and diﬀerentiating
it with respect to the coeﬃcients pi (i = 1, . . . , m) and equating the obtained
derivatives to zero, the system of the linear algebraic equations is obtained. In
the course of solving this system, coeﬃcients pi are determined, and thereby the
approximated distributions of temperature in the domain D and the heat ﬂux
on the boundary Γ1 are obtained.

Numerical Example

The theoretical considerations introduced in the previous sections will be illustrated with an example, in which: β = 1, a = 1, λ = 2, ξ(t) = a t, ϕ(x) = e−x ,
κ = λ/a, u∗ = 1, t∗ = 1. Then the exact solution of the inverse Stefan problem can be found from the following functions: u(x, t) = ea t−x for (x, t) ∈ D,
and q(t) = λ ea t−β for t ∈ [0, t∗ ]. As basis functions we take ψi (t) = ti−1 , i =
1, . . . , m. For the calculations, we assume m ∈ {2, 3, . . . , 6} and n ∈ {2, 3, . . . , 7}.
Figure 2 shows the exact and the reconstructed heat ﬂux on the boundary Γ1
for a diﬀerent number of elements of the sum (12), n ∈ {4, 7} and for six basis
functions ψi (t). The results obtained show that functions q(t) and u(x, t) are
reconstructed very well.

Conclusion

We have presented a method for solving the one-phase inverse Stefan problem
which consists of the reconstruction of the function describing the heat ﬂux on
the boundary, when the position of the moving interface is well-known. The
method makes use of the Adomian decomposition method and the least square
method. The calculations presented show that this method is eﬀective for solving
this problem.
