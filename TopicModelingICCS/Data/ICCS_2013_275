Abstract
A non-overlapping domain decomposition method is developed for coupled Stokes-Darcy ﬂows in irregular domains. The
Stokes region is discretized by standard Stokes ﬁnite elements while the Darcy region is discretized by the multipoint ﬂux
mixed ﬁnite element method. The subdomain grids may not match on the interfaces and mortar ﬁnite elements are employed
to impose weakly interface continuity conditions. The interfaces can be curved and matching conditions are imposed via
appropriate mappings from physical grids to reference grids with ﬂat interfaces. The global problem is reduced to a mortar
interface problem, which is solved by the conjugate gradient method. Each iteration involves solving subdomain problems of
either Stokes or Darcy type, which is done in parallel. Computational experiments are presented to illustrate the convergence
of the discretization and the condition number of the interface operator.
Keywords: non-overlapping domain decomposition; Stokes-Darcy ﬂows; mixed ﬁnite element; multipoint ﬂux

1. Introduction
Computational modeling of coupled Stokes and Darcy ﬂows has been actively investigated in recent years due
its many applications, including interaction between surface and subsurface ﬂows, industrial ﬁltration, fuel cells,
and blood ﬂows. In [1, 2], existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for the coupled model with the BeaversJoseph-Saﬀman [3, 4] interface condition was shown. Many numerical discretizations for this model can be found
in the literature [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
In this paper, we consider a multidomain formulation, where the simulation domain is decomposed into a
union of non-overlapping subdomains of either Stokes or Darcy type. The subdomains are discretized by appropriate stable ﬁnite elements on a ﬁne scale, allowing for the grids to be non-matching across interfaces. Coarse
scale mortar ﬁnite elements are used to impose weakly continuity conditions [13]. Since we consider multiple subdomains, we must account for three types interfaces conditions: Stokes-Darcy, Darcy-Darcy and Stokes-Stokes.
On Stokes-Darcy interfaces, normal velocity and normal stress are continuous. On Stokes-Stokes interfaces, both
normal and tangential velocity and stress are continuous. On Darcy-Darcy interfaces, normal velocity and pressure are continuous. We employ a non-overlapping domain decomposition (DD) [14, 15, 16] method to reduce the
global problem to an interface problem which is solved by the conjugate gradient method. Each iteration involves
solving subdomain problems of either Stokes or Darcy type, which is done in parallel.

We consider eﬃcient and accurate discretizations for subdomains with curved interfaces, allowing for the
grids to be non-matching across interfaces. In the Darcy region we employ the multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite
element (MFMFE) method [17, 18, 19]. The method can handle irregular grids and reduces to cell-centered ﬁnite
diﬀerences for the pressure. Standard conforming Stokes elements are used in the Stokes region. Interface mortar
conditions on curved interfaces with non-matching grids are imposed by mapping the physical grids to reference
grids with ﬂat interfaces.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the mathematical model for the coupled
Stokes-Darcy ﬂow problem and a domain decomposition weak formulation. The discretization and theoretical
convergence rates are presented in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the non-overlapping domain decomposition
algorithm and theoretical condition number estimates. Numerical examples that illustrate the behavior of the
method for model test cases and a simulation of coupled surface-groundwater ﬂows are provided in Section 5.
2. Problem description
The domain Ω ⊂ Rd for the coupled model consists of two regions: Stokes ﬂow in ﬂuid region Ω s and Darcy
ﬂow in porous media region Ωd . The two regions do not have to be connected. They share the interface Γ sd =
∂Ω s ∩ ∂Ωd . We denote the boundaries for the Darcy and the Stokes part, respectively, by Γd = ∂Ωd \ Γ sd , and Γ s =
∂Ω s \ Γ sd . The outward unit normal vectors on Ω s and Ωd are denoted by n s and nd , respectively. Let the velocity
and pressure in the Stokes and Darcy regions be u s , p s and ud , pd , respectively. The deformation rate tensor D(u s )
and the stress tensor T(u s , p s ) in the Stokes region are deﬁned by D(u s ) := 12 (∇u s + (∇u s )T ), T(u s , p s ) :=
−p s I + 2ν s D(u s ). The ﬂuid viscosity is ν s in the Stokes region and νd in the Darcy region. The body force in
the Stokes region is denoted by f s ; fd represents the gravity force in Darcy region. Let K denote the bounded,
symmetric, and uniformly positive deﬁnite rock permeability tensor in the porous medium, and let qd denote an
external source or sink term in Ωd . It is assumed to satisfy the solvability condition Ω qd dx = 0. With the above
d
notation, the ﬂow equations in the Stokes region with no slip boundary condition are
−∇ · T ≡ −2ν s ∇ · D(us ) + ∇p s = f s ,

∇ · us = 0

The ﬂow equations in the Darcy region with no ﬂow boundary condition are

on Γd .

The model is completed with the interface conditions

1 ≤ i ≤ N, the Stokes subdomains running from 1 to N s . We denote Γi j = ∂Ωi ∩ ∂Ω j , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N. Let
Γ ss and Γdd denote the set of Stokes-Stokes and Darcy-Darcy interfaces: Γ ss = ∪1≤i< j≤Ns ∂Ωi ∩ ∂Ω j , Γdd =
∪Ns +1≤i< j≤N ∂Ωi ∩ ∂Ω j . The union of all the interfaces is denoted by Γ = Γ sd ∪ Γdd ∪ Γ ss . In addition to the

[ud · n] = 0,

[pd ] = 0 on Γdd ,

[u s ] = 0,

[T(u s , p s )n] = 0

on Γ ss ,

(4)

where the jumps on an interface Γi j , for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, are deﬁned as: [v · n] = vi · ni + v j · n j , [Tn] = Ti ni + T j n j ,
and [v] = (vi − v j )|Γi j , where vi = v|Ωi and ni denotes the outward unit normal vector on ∂Ωi .
In the ﬂuid region Ω s , the velocity and pressure spaces are given by
X s = v s ∈ L2 (Ω s )d : v s,i ∈ H 1 (Ω s,i )d , v s = 0 on Γ s

and W s = L2 (Ω s ).

In the porous medium region Ωd , we deﬁne the velocity and pressure spaces by
Xd = vd ∈ L2 (Ωd )d : vd,i ∈ H(div; Ωd,i ), vd · nd = 0 on Γd

and Wd = L2 (Ωd ),

where H(div; Ωd,i ) = {vd ∈ (L2 (Ωd,i ))d : ∇ · vd,i ∈ L2 (Ωd,i )}. The spaces on the whole domain are deﬁned by
X = X s ⊕ Xd and W = w = (w s , wd ) ∈ W s ⊕ Wd :

Ω

w dx = 0 .

The interface space Λ is the dual of the trace of u s on Γ ss or the normal trace ud · n on Γ sd and Γdd . The

3. Finite element discretization
Let Tih to be a family of shape regular partitions of Ωi consisting of triangles or tetrahedra in the Stokes region
and triangles, tetrahedra, quadrilaterals, or hexahedra in the Darcy region, where h is the maximum element
diameter. Partitions Tih and T jh may not match on the interface Γi j . On the interface we deﬁne a coarse scale
partition TiHj with a maximum element size H consisting of segments, triangles, or parallelograms.

In the Stokes region, for each Ω s,i , let (X s,i
, W s,i
) ⊂ H 1 (Ω s,i )n × L2 (Ω s,i ) be a pair of ﬁnite element spaces
which satisfy a uniform discrete inf-sup condition for the divergence and Korn inequality for the deformation
tensor, such as the MINI elements, the Taylor-Hood elements or the Bernardi-Raugel elements [20]. We assume
that each pair contains at least polynomials of degree r s and r s − 1 for velocity and pressure, respectively. In

We assume that each pair contains at least polynomials of degree rd and ld
for velocity and pressure, respectively, where ld = rd or ld = rd − 1. We also consider a special mixed element
method called the multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element (MFMFE) method for eﬃcient discretizations of Darcy ﬂow
on irregular grids [17, 18, 19]. The method employs the lowest order BDM1 space on simplices or quadrilaterals
or an enhanced BDDF1 space on hexahedra. These spaces have the property that on each element edge of face
with s vertices, the velocity space has s normal degrees of freedom, one associated with each vertex. This allows
for the velocity to be eliminated locally around each vertex in terms of neighboring pressures through the use of an
appropriate quadrature rule, resulting in a cell-centered system for the pressure. The mixed ﬁnite element spaces
in Darcy are deﬁned on a reference element Eˆ and via a bijection mapping F E : Eˆ → E on the physical elements
as

where the Piola transformation is used to preserve normal components of the velocity. Here DF E and JE =
|det(DF E )| are the Jacobian matrix and its determinant, respectively. In the MFMFE method, we employ the
quadrature rule on an element E for the local velocity elimination as

Note that this the trapezoidal quadrature rule on the reference element. It localizes the interactions of the velocity
degrees of freedom and gives a block diagonal velocity mass matrix with blocks associated with mesh vertices.
It is then inexpensive to eliminate the velocities resulting in a positive deﬁnite pressure system. The global ﬁnite

The multiscale mortar ﬁnite element discretization for the Stokes-Darcy system is given by: ﬁnd (uh , ph , λH ) ∈

Remark 3.1. To handle domains with curved non-matching grid interfaces, the continuity condition (10) is imposed by mapping the subdomain and mortar grids to reference grids with ﬂat interfaces. On Stokes-Darcy and

1081

Darcy-Darcy interfaces, we employ the Piola transformation for the velocity, which preserves the normal compoˆ e|. The matching condition [uh · n], μH = 0 is imposed on the reference grid
nent of the vector: u · n|e| = uˆ · n|ˆ
conﬁguration by projecting the normal component on each side onto the reference mortar grid. On Stokes-Stokes
interfaces, the grids are also mapped to reference grids to impose [uh ], μH = 0. Since full vector continuity is
imposed, the standard change of variables is used to map the velocity space in this case.
The following convergence result has been shown in [13, 21].

4. A non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm
In this section, we present a non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm [22]. We show that the algebraic system (8)–(10) can be reduced to a mortar interface problem for λH that can be solved by a Krylov space
iterative method. Each iteration requires computing the action of the interface operator, which is done by solving
subdomain problems of either Stokes or Darcy type in parallel.
Following [14], each local problem can be split into two parts. One part has speciﬁed normal stress in Stokes
or pressure in Darcy on the interface and zero source term and boundary conditions. The other part is the complementary problem with zero normal stress or pressure on the interface and the given source term and boundary
conditions. In the Darcy subdomains Ωi , NS + 1 ≤ i ≤ N, given pressure λn on Γi j , the ﬁrst problem is: ﬁnd

It is easy to see that solving (8)–(10) is equivalent to solving the interface problem: ﬁnd λH ∈ Λh such that
¯ μH ),
s(λH , μH ) ≡ −bΓ (u∗ (λH ), μH ) = bΓ (u,

μH ∈ ΛH .

(15)

¯ ph =
After solving interface problems, one can recover the global velocity and pressure by uh = u∗ (λH ) + u,
∗ H

p (λ ) + p.
Let us introduce the Steklov–Poincar´e type operator S : ΛH → ΛH ,
∀ λH ∈ Λ H ,

(S λH , μH ) = s(λH , μH ) ∀ μH ∈ ΛH .

Then the interface problem (15) can be written as: ﬁnd λH ∈ ΛH such that
S λH = b,

(16)

where b : ΛH → R, b(μH ) = bΓ (u¯ h , μH ), ∀ μH ∈ ΛH .
The matrix form of the above method is as follows. We use u, p, and λ to represent the degrees of freedom for
velocity, pressure, and Lagrange multipliers, respectively. The discrete right hand side functions in the coupled
system are denoted by F and Q. The linear system arising in (8)–(10) is of the form

where x = (u, p)t is the vector of subdomain unknowns and η = (F, Q)t . Then the matrix form of the interface
problem (16) corresponds to the Schur complement system

which is achieved by solving local subdomain problems in parallel. The following result on the properties of the
interface operator has been shown in [22] for the case H = O(h).
Theorem 4.1. The bilinear form s(·, ·) is symmetric and positive deﬁnite on ΛH \ R. Moreover, there exist positive
constants C1 and C2 independent of h and H such that

where Kmin and Kmax are the smallest and largest eigenvalues of K, respectively.
The above result implies that the Conjugate Gradient method can be employed for the solution of the interface
problem (15). The condition number of the interface operator is O(h−2 ). Eﬃcient interface preconditioners such
as balancing [23, 24] can be employed to speed up the iteration. Another possibility is to employ a multiscale ﬂux
basis [25] to reduce the cost of each interface iterations.
5. Numerical results
In this section, we present three numerical examples to study the behavior of the method. In the numerical
tests we consider the case T(u s , p s ) = −p s I + ν∇u s in Ω s . In the ﬁrst two examples we take K = KI in Ωd , where

1083

K is a positive constant. In the last example we test heterogeneous permeability. In the ﬁrst example, we test the
numerical convergence and the condition number of the interface algebraic system. The analytical solution is as
in the numerical tests in [13]. It is designed to satisfy the interface conditions (1)–(3). The computational domain
ˆ where Ω
ˆ s = (0, 2) × ( 1 , 1) and Ω
ˆ d = (0, 2) × (0, 1 ). The
Ω = Ω s ∪ Ωd is a smooth map of the reference domain Ω,

boundary conditions are deﬁned as follows. In the Darcy region, the pressure is speciﬁed on the left, right, and
bottom boundaries, while in the Stokes region, the velocity is speciﬁed on the left and top boundaries, and normal
and tangential stress are speciﬁed on the right boundary. We split the domain into eight subdomains, four in Stokes
and four in Darcy. The subdomain girds are non-matching on the interfaces. We use the lowest order Taylor–Hood
triangular ﬁnite elements (r s = 2) to discretize the Stokes subdomains and the MFMFE method on quadrilaterals
(rd = ld = 0) to discretize the Darcy subdomains. Discontinuous piecewise linear mortar ﬁnite elements are used
on all interfaces (r ss = r sd = rdd = 1). To test convergence, we run a sequence of nested grid reﬁnements. The
coarsest level girds are alternating 3 × 4 and 2 × 3 and H = 2h. The computed vertical velocity and its numerical
error on the second level are shown in Figure 1. Note that the vertical velocity, which is normal to the StokesDarcy interface is continuous. The numerical errors and convergence rates are reported in Tables 1 and 2, where
l denotes the grid level. We observe convergence for the Stokes velocity and pressure of order between h3/2 and
h2 , as well as ﬁrst order convergence for the Darcy velocity and pressure. The optimal convergence rates for stand
alone discretizations are second order for Stokes and ﬁrst order for Darcy. The reduction in the Stokes convergence
in the coupled case is expected, due to the coupling with the lower order Darcy discretization and the eﬀect of the
non-matching grids error, see Theorem 3.1. In Table 3 we report the extreme eigenvalues and condition number
of the interface operator and the number of CG iterations on all grid levels. We conﬁrm that smallest eigenvalue
is O(h) and the largest eigenvalue is O(h−1 ), leading to condition number is O(h−2 ), as predicted by Theorem 4.1.

inﬂow condition on the the left boundary and zero stress on the right boundary. On the top surface boundary of

the Stokes region, a combination of horizontal velocity and zero normal stress is speciﬁed. In the Darcy region,
we specify no ﬂow condition on the left and right boundaries and Dirichlet pressure condition on the bottom
boundary. There are no external forces. In this example we study the eﬀect of changing the permeability on the
interface condition number. We run three tests with K = 1.0, 0.1, 0.01 on the same sequence of grid reﬁnements as
in Example 1. The results are presented in Tables 4–6. In all three cases the smallest eigenvalue is approximately
a constant, which indicates that the constant term on the left in (18) is dominant. In the case K = 1.0, the largest
eigenvalue is O(h−1 ) as expected by the theory. In the cases K = 0.1 and K = 0.01, the largest eigenvalue is
approximately constant, which indicates that for small enough permeability the constant term on the right in (18)
is dominant. We also observe that the largest eigenvalue scales with K, which is consistent with the right inequality
in (18).

The ﬁnal example is a simulation of coupled surface water and ground water ﬂows using the realistic geometry
from Example 2 and heterogeneous permeability K given by a single realization of a stochastic permeability ﬁeld.
A Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL) expansion for the log permeability Y = ln(K) (a scalar quantity) is computed from the
speciﬁed covariance function

The parameters used for this test are mean value 1.0, correlation lengths η1 = 0.1, η2 = 0.05, and variance
σY = 2.1. The series is truncated after 400 terms. The permeability is shown in Figure 3. The boundary conditions
are as in Example 2, except that no ﬂow is speciﬁed on the right boundary in Stokes. The grids are as in Example 2,
except that they have been reﬁned by 2 in the x-direction. The computed solution on the second reﬁnement level is
plotted in Figure 4. The eigenvalues and condition number of the interface operator are presented in Table 7. Since

6. Conclusions
We presented a domain decomposition framework for coupled Stokes-Darcy ﬂows. The methodology is ﬂexible as it allows for diﬀerent grids and discretization methods to be used in the diﬀerent subdomains. Here this is
illustrated by the use of the MFMFE method in the Darcy region, which provides and eﬃcient and accurate way
to discretize ﬂows on irregular geometries and heterogeneous media. Coarse scale mortar ﬁnite elements on the
interfaces are utilized to impose weakly the interface conditions on non-matching grids. The resulting algebraic
problem is solved in parallel via a non-overlapping domain decomposition algorithm by reducing it to an interface
problem for the normal stress (or pressure). Numerical results illustrate the optimal convergence of the method
and the condition number of the interface problem.
