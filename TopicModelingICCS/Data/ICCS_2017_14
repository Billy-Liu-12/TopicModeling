a very challenging non-linear combinatorial optimization problem to solve optimally, and it is the
generalization of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) which is NP-hard (Sahni and Gonzalez,
1976). Exact methods can only solve small problem instances whereas heuristics do not guarantee the
optimality. Therefore, researchers recently find hybrid methods and matheuristics promising to
address the problem.
The Dynamic Facility Layout Problem (DFLP) deals with the facility design where there are
multiple planning periods, and the interdepartmental material flows change over the planning periods
due to frequent changes in product demands, such as in technology-heavy industries. The DFLP with
equal area departments was first introduced in (Rosenblatt, 1986). In this paper, the DFLP with
unequal area departments is considered, and there have been different solution techniques suggested
for the problem. These techniques are i) exact methods (Montreuil & Venkatadri, 1991; Montreuil &
Laforge, 1992; Lacksonen, 1994; Yang & Peters, 1998), ii) heuristics (Jolai et al., 2012; McKendall &
Hakobyan, 2010; Abedzadeh et al., 2013; Mazinani et al., 2013), and iii) matheuristics (Dunker et al.,
2005; Kulturel-Konak & Konak, 2015). Balakrishnan & Cheung (1998) and Kulturel-Konak (2007)
provided two state-of-the-art surveys of the DFLP.
In this paper, a zone-based layout (Montreuil et al., 2002) is used for the first time in the context of
the DFLP, hereafter called zone-based DFLP (ZDFLP). In the zone-based layout, the facility is first
divided into non-overlapping zones, and then departments are arranged in these zones without
crossing the zone boundaries. The main advantages of the zone-based layout are: (i) a zone-based
block layout can easily be transferred to a detailed layout, (ii) it inherently includes possible aisle
structures, and (iii) it can be tailored to the unique needs of the manufacturing system. Therefore, the
zone-based layout is applicable to many types of real-life production systems (Montreuil et al., 2002).
These advantages are particularly significant in the DFLP because the changes in a block layout
between consecutive periods may require structural modifications in the material handling system
and/or in the facility, which in turn may be very costly or sometimes impossible to implement
practically. The majority of existing approaches to the DFLP consider only relayout costs due to
relocating departments, but not the cost of changing the structure of the facility. The ZDFLP can
consider the costs due to the changes in the structure of the facility. Another contribution of the
ZDFLP is that department dimensions are treated as decision variables, unlike many previous DFLP
models. A matheuristic approach, which combines concepts from Tabu Search (TS) and mathematical
programming, is proposed to solve the ZDFLP on the continuous plane with unequal area
departments. The relative locations of departments and their assignments to zones are determined by
the TS while their exact locations and shapes are calculated by the mathematical programming.
Promising numerical results are presented for a set of test problems from the literature.

In the ZDFLP, the facility is divided into horizontal and vertical bands. Although not all of the
bands have to be used, the maximum numbers of horizontal and vertical bands are predefined in the
formulation. Each zone is the cross section of a horizontal band and a vertical band. Departments are
not allowed to cross over the band boundaries or expand over multiple zones. Practical requirements,
such as straight aisle structures, justify this restriction. In Problem ZDFLP, the departments in the
same zone are arranged only in the x-axis direction. Therefore, each department will be adjacent to at
least a band boundary, which explicitly represents a possible location for an aisle or material handling
equipment. The ZDFLP can be modified to allow the arrangement of departments in the y-axis
direction or in the combination of both axes directions. In the approach developed in this paper, both
relative department locations and department dimensions are determined simultaneously as in
(Kulturel-Konak & Konak, 2015). The objective (1) of the ZDFLP is to minimize the total of material
handling and relayout costs. Relayout costs include three parts: (i) a fixed relayout cost is incurred if a

1377

department is moved between two consecutive periods, (ii) a variable relayout cost is incurred based
on how much the centroids of a department is moved between two consecutive periods, (iii) a fixed
relayout cost is incurred if boundaries of a band is moved between two consecutive periods.
Relocating the boundaries of bands from one period to another may indicate significant changes in the
layout that may require modifications to the material handling system as well. In fact, the cost of such
structural changes can be more costly than relocating departments and should be considered in the
DFLP.

Constraint (2) ensures that departments do not overlap in x-axis direction; therefore, the sum of
binary decision variables zijtx for each department pair cannot be bigger than one in each period.
Constraint (3) requires departments i and j to precede one another in the x-axis direction if they are
assigned to the same zone. These binary variables are used in disjunctive constraint (4) to prevent
overlapping of departments i and j in the x-axis direction if zijtx  1 in period t. Therefore, constraints
(2)-(4) work together to prevent overlapping of departments at least in one axis direction. Constraints
(5) and (6) are used to determine the rectilinear distance between the centroids of departments i and j
with a positive material flow in period t. In constraints (7) and (8), variables uitx and uity indicate how
much the centroid of department i is moved in the x- and y-axis directions from period (t-1) to period t,
respectively. In the objective function (1), the sum of the variables uitx and uity are multiplied by Qit
to calculate the first part of the total rearrangement cost. In constraints (9)-(12), binary variable vit
captures whether department i is relocated (vit=1) or not (vit=0) between periods (t-1) and t. A fixed
department rearrangement cost of Rit is incurred due to the second part of the total rearrangement cost
if department i is rearranged between periods (t-1) and t. In constraints (13) and (14), variable oktx and
okty indicate how much the western boundary of vertical band k in the x-axis direction and the southern
boundary of horizontal band k in the y-axis direction are moved from period (t-1) to period t,
respectively. In the objective function (1), the variables oktx and okty are multiplied by Bkt to calculate
the last part of the total rearrangement cost. If a department is assigned to a zone, we make sure that
the department is not crossing over the band boundaries using constraints (15)-(20). Then, band
boundary constraints follow: Constraint (21) ensures that the western boundary of vertical band k in
period t is not exceeding the eastern boundary of vertical band k in period t. Constraint (22) ensures
that the eastern boundary of vertical band (k-1) in period t equals the western boundary of vertical
band k in the same period. Similarly, constraints (23) and (24) ensures band boundaries for horizontal
bands. Constraints (25)-(28) ensure that the band boundaries do not exceed the facility limits. Upper
and lower bounds on the side lengths of departments are enforced using constraints (29) and (30).
Finally, constraint (31) uses the polyhedral outer approximation method of Sherali et al. (2003) to
model non-linear minimum department area requirements. As stated in Kulturel-Konak & Konak
(2013), the number of tangential support points (i.e., ) determines the accuracy of the area
approximation. In constraint (31), the tangential support points are calculated as follows:

3 Methodology
A matheuristic approach, hereafter called TSMIP, which combines concepts from Tabu Search (TS)
and mathematical programming, is proposed to solve the zone-based DFLP on the continuous plane
with unequal area departments. TS is one of the local search based meta-heuristic optimization
methods (Glover, 1989, 1990; Glover & Laguna, 1997), and it has been proven to be a useful search
technique for optimization problems with complex solution spaces with successful application to the
FLP literature (Kaku & Mazzola, 1997; Kulturel-Konak et al., 2004; Scholz et al., 2009; Singh, 2009;
Kulturel-Konak, 2012; Kothari & Ghosh, 2013; Bozorgi, 2015). The TSMIP determines the relative
locations of departments and their assignments to zones while their exact locations and shapes are
x
,
determined by mathematical programming. In order words, the values of decision variables zijtx , bikt
y
and bikt are fixed based on the encoding of the TSMIP, and then the ZDFLP is solved optimally to

determine all other decision variables and the objective function value. Note that the other binary
decision variables depend on the exact shapes and locations of the departments, and they are mainly
used to calculate the objective function value.

3.1 Solution Encoding and a Penalty Function
For each period t, a permutation encoding is used with W=(N+nbxnby) elements. Fig. 1 presents
an example encoding for a single period and the layout that this encoding represents in order to
explain better how the encoding works. The department sequence represents the precedence
relationships in the x-axis direction for the departments in the same zone. For example, department 5
x
precedes department 3 (i.e., z53
t  1 ) in the layout since department 5 is just before department 3 in the
permutation encoding. In the permutation encoding, zeros represent zone breaks (when a zone starts
and ends) in the order of zones (1,1), (1,2), …, (nbx, nby). For example, the first zero indicates ending
of zone (1,1) and starting of zone (1,2). The departments listed between two consecutive zeros are
located in the same zone. The TSMIP is initialized by generating a random permutation of
departments and zone breaks for each time period.

y

, and bikt variables
The ZDFLP may not have an integer feasible solution for a setting of zijtx , bikt

encoded in the permutation of a candidate solution. In this case, the fitness of the candidate solution
cannot be evaluated in the TSMIP. This is an especially important problem at the beginning of the
search where candidate solutions are likely to be infeasible. To ensure that the ZDFLP always finds an
integer solution during the search process of the TSMIP, constraints (26) and (28) are relaxed as
follows:

where ptx >=0 and pty >=0 are the penalty terms for the eastern boundary of the last vertical and the
northern boundary of the last horizontal bands, respectively. These variables are forced to be zero by
T

adding the penalty term   ( ptx  pty ) to the objective function where  is a static penalty coefficient.
t 1

For a candidate solution, if ptx =0 and pty =0 t, then the candidate solution is also feasible for the
original problem. This penalty approach eliminates the need for starting the search with a feasible
solution and the complexity of dealing with multiple penalty functions.

3.2 Overall Algorithm
Below, the pseudo code of the TSMIP is given. The TSMIP has two moves to create candidate
solutions (CanSol) and to search the neighborhood of the current solution (CurSol). Swap(i, j, t)
represents swapping positions i and j in the permutation of period t. Insert(i, j, t) represents inserting
position i before position j and rearranging the permutation between positions i and j. Note that
because some positions of the permutation also hold zone breaks, the swap and insert moves can
create, delete, empty, or fill a zone. Therefore, we do not need any other special moves to change the
zone structure of a solution. The TSMIP uses either Swap or Insert moves in an iteration and switches
between them after five consecutive iterations of the same move in which the best solution has not
been improved. In the ZDFLP, the size of the neighborhood is quite large. In addition, the ZDFLP
should be solved for each candidate solution. Therefore, exhaustively investigating each candidate
solution in the current neighborhood is computationally expensive. In the TSMIP, an admissible
move is performed with a probability of  that is initiated as 0.1 at the beginning of the search and
slowly increased if the Best Solution (BestSol) has not been improved in the last 10 consecutive
iterations. The tabu list (TabuList) includes the whole solution structure of the best candidate
solution (BestCan). In each iteration, the best non-tabu candidate is selected as the new current
solution and added to the tabu list and not allowed for the next 10 iterations. The TSMIP is terminated
when a maximum number of iterations (gmax) are reached, or BestSol cannot be improved in the last
gstop iterations.

4 Computational Experiments
Three test problems from Lacksonen (1994), DFLP 12-3 (12 departments- 3 periods), DFLP 12-5
(12 departments- 5 periods), and DFLP 20-3 (20 departments- 3 periods), were studied. The
dimensions of the departments are not predefined in these problems, and a maximum aspect ratio of 2
is used to control the department shapes. The linearization approach to department area constraints
was expected to yield 0-3% error according to an earlier work (Lacksonen, 1994). The TSMIP was
run with =5 (the number of tangential support points) to compare the results with the previous ones
under the similar levels of area approximation error. In this paper, nbx=3 and nby=3 were used for
DFLP 12-3 and DFLP12-5 while nbx=2 and nby=3 were used for DFLP 20-3. In these instances, band
relocation costs of Bktx  100 and Bkty  100 were used for all band boundaries k and periods t. The
TSMIP was coded using the AMPL modeling language and interfaced with CPLEX 12.4 to solve
reduced MIP problems. All runs were performed in the Lion-XJ Linux cluster of the Research
Computing and Cyber Infrastructure at the Pennsylvania State University. The stopping condition
parameters were: gmax=400 and gstop=50. The CPU times are comparable with a single 3.2 GHz Intel
Xeon Processor with 32 GB memory. Table 1 summarizes the best and average solutions found in
five random replications for the three test problems Lacksonen (1997). In addition, the best solutions
that were found by solving the ZDFLP with CPLEX for 48-hour time limit are provided. The TSMIP
found better solutions for all three problems. The ZDFLP is more constrained than the unrestricted
DFLP model where departments can be located anywhere in the facility, not only in defined zones.
Therefore, finding better or comparable results to the previous ones may indicate a good performance
of the TSMIP.

Although nbx=2 and nby=3 are used in DFLP 20-3, the final solution uses three horizontal bands
and only one vertical band as seen in Fig. 2. The band boundaries of the solution in Fig. 2 remain the
same throughout the planning horizon. The changes in the layout structure are conservative because

the cost of any modifications in the band boundaries is considered in the objective function.
Therefore, the layout in Fig. 2 may lead to fewer changes in the aisle structure of the facility
throughout the planning horizon, resulting in a more practical block layout design.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, a zone-based layout is proposed for the DFLP (ZDFLP) with unequal area
departments. The objective of the ZDFLP is to find practical block layouts which are easily
transferable to detailed real-life layouts. Moreover, department shapes are considered as decision
variables using a polyhedral outer approximation in the context of the DFLP. The proposed
matheuristic solution approach combines concepts from Tabu Search (TS) and mathematical
programming to solve the ZDFLP with unequal area departments and variable department shapes. In
this approach, the TS determines the relative locations of departments and their assignments to zones
while their exact locations and shapes are calculated by the mathematical programming. Promising
numerical results are presented for a set of test problems from the literature. As a future research
avenue, different heuristic rules can be utilized to define department shapes; with an expectation of an
improvement in the algorithm efficiency to be able to solve larger problem instances. In addition,
other important decisions in the FLP such as input/output locations, aisle structures, and aisle sizes can
be incorporated into the proposed solution approach, leading to an integrated DFLP.
