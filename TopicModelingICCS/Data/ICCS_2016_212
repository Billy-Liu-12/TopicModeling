Abstract
The standard nodal Lagrangian based continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method (FEM) and
control volume ﬁnite element method (CVFEM) are well known techniques for solving partial
diﬀerential equations. Both of these methods have a common shortcoming in that the ﬁrst
derivative of the approximate solution of both methods is discontinuous. Further shortcomings
of nodal Lagrangian bases arise when considering time dependent problems. For instance,
increasing the degree of the basis in an eﬀort to improve the accuracy of the approximate
solution prohibits the use of common techniques such as mass matrix lumping. We introduce
a μth degree clamped basis-spline (B-spline) based analog of both the control volume ﬁnite
element method and the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method in conjunction with a post
processing technique which shall impose local conservation. The advantage of these techniques
is that the B-spline basis is not only non-negative for any order μ, and thus lends itself to mass
matrix lumping for higher order basis functions, but also, for μ > 2, each basis function is
smooth on the domain. We implement both the B-spline based CVFEM and FEM techniques
as well as the post processing technique as they pertain to solving various two-point boundary
value problems. A comparison of the convergence rates and properties of the error associated
with satisfying local conservation is presented.

Introduction

Many modern techniques of solving partial diﬀerential equations are well known and understood.
Examples of such techniques include the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method, control
volume ﬁnite element method, ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, and mixed ﬁnite element method.
Local conservation is critically important in any physical application of such solution techniques
to a partial diﬀerential equation derived from conservative laws. A number of the numerical

techniques listed above, such as ﬁnite volume methods [1, 2], and mixed ﬁnite element methods
[3], are speciﬁcally designed to impose local conservation.
Continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method does not, in general, yield a solution which
satisﬁes local conservation. As a result, continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element methods are no
longer a viable option for any application requiring local conservation if they are not equipped
with a post processing technique to recover a locally conservative solution. Various methods
have been invented to rectify this deﬁciency for Lagrangian based continuous Galerkin ﬁnite
element method (see for example [4, 5, 6, 7]). However, Lagrangian bases are not necessarily
suitable for all tasks.
For time dependent problems where utilizing higher-order of polynomials is desirable to
increase accuracy, the Lagrangian bases may not be a suitable choice. This is due to the
fact that higher-order Lagrangian bases have negative values. Preserving non-negativity of
the basis used in solution representation is a particularly beneﬁcial trait for common numerical
techniques, such a lumping of the mass matrix, which is used in solving time dependent problems
[8]. For this reason, alternative bases which are non-negative at a minimum, are of interest as
a basis for continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method. The μth order B-spline basis is one such
non-negative basis.
While B-spline based continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element methods have been previously implemented (see for example, [9, 10, 11]), the issue of B-spline based locally conservative methods
has yet to be addressed. We explore some of the preliminary results using B-spline based solution techniques in the eﬀort to construct solutions which do in fact satisfy local conservation. In
so doing, we construct two such solutions via a ﬁnite volume method based technique as well as
post processed ﬁnite element solution. Both of these techniques have already been implemented
for the standard Lagrangian basis. One advantage of implementing these two techniques with
the Lagrangian basis as opposed to the B-spline basis is that the choice of suitable control
volumes is fairly straightforward for the Lagrangian basis. However, determining a suitable
set of control volumes for the B-spline based techniques is still an open problem. We note
that coupling post-processing with B-spline based ﬁnite element methods has been previously
implemented, see for example [12]. However, the post processing implemented in [12] pertains
to recovering quantities computed directly from the approximate solution obtained from the
ﬁnite element method as opposed to recovering a solution which satisﬁes local conservation.
In this paper we begin in Section 2 by presenting the ODE to be solved as well as the
corresponding statement of local conservation. We then move to Subsection 2.1 in which we
describe the μth order clamped B-spline basis which shall serve as the basis for the numerical
techniques implemented in Subsections 2.2 and 2.4. Subsection 2.2 explains the continuous
Galerkin ﬁnite element method (FEM). Subsection 2.3 describes the post processing technique
which shall be applied to the solution obtained from the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element
method. The second technique, which is presented below in Subsection 2.4, is the control
volume ﬁnite element method (CVFEM). Lastly, in Section 3, we present the results of our
experiments. In Subsections 3.1 and 3.2 we collect and discuss results for two examples.

In the following subsections, we present the μth order clamped B-spline basis and describe
the numerical solution techniques to approximate the solution to (1).

2.1

Representation of the approximate solutions using B-splines

In this section, we describe the μth order clamped B-spline basis, using which the approximate
solution is represented. Proper deﬁnition of this basis relies on two fundamental elements of
the B-spline basis of order μ. The ﬁrst fundamental element of the μth order B-spline basis
is obtained by discretizing the interval [0,1] with a vector t ∈ Rn , where t1 = 0, tn = 1 and
ti < ti+1 for i ∈ {1, · · · , n−1}. In spline literature, the entries of this vector are often referred to
as break points. The second necessary component of the basis is the knots vector kμ ∈ Rn+2μ−2
that is constructed by appending [t1 · · · t1 ] ∈ Rμ−1 to the left end of t and [tn · · · tn ] ∈ Rμ−1
to the right end of t :
kμ = [t1 · · · t1 t tn · · · tn ] .
While there are diﬀerent ways to deﬁne this basis, we adhere to de Boor’s recursive algorithm.

This is known as the Cox-de Boor recursion formula for deﬁning the μth degree B-spline
basis. Practically, when applying this formula, de Boor notes that we assume “anything times
zero is zero” [13]. This basis has a number of desirable properties. Firstly, the basis functions
Biμ have compact support, more precisely, supp(Biμ ) ⊂ [ki , ki+μ ], where ki are knots from the
aforementioned knot vector kμ . Secondly, Biμ ∈ C μ−2 (0, 1). Thirdly, the basis forms a partition

Bi (x) = 1 for each x ∈ [0, 1]. Lastly, each Biμ is nonnegative. A more
precise and extensive discussion of these, along with additional properties of B-spline bases can

FEM

The continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method is based on variational formulation associated
with (1). To carry out its derivation, we begin by setting
V = v ∈ H 1 (0, 1) : v(0) = 0 .

(5)

Let uD ∈ H 1 (0, 1) such that uD (0) = u0 . The variational formulation associated with (1) is to
ﬁnd u ∈ H 1 (0, 1) with (u − uD ) ∈ V that satisﬁes
a(u, v) = (v) ∀ v ∈ V,
where

The existence and uniqueness of the solution (6) is guaranteed by the Lax-Milgram Theorem
provided a(·, ·) is bounded and coercive and (·) is bounded, see for example [14].
Practically, we recast this problem onto the ﬁnite dimensional subspace of V using B-splines
given in Subsection 2.1. In particular, we set
Vhμ = span {Biμ : 2 ≤ i ≤ n + μ − 2} ,
where h =

(7)

max {hi }, with hi = ti+1 − ti . We note that B1μ (0) = 0, so to construct a ﬁnite

1≤i≤n−1

dimensional subspace of V, this function is omitted. The ﬁnite element approximation is to ﬁnd
uh with (uh − uD,h ) ∈ Vhμ that satisﬁes
a(uh , wh ) = (wh ) ∀wh ∈ Vhμ .

(8)

Doing so yields an algebraic system

where Aij =
whose entries are the coeﬃcients in the representation of uh ∈ Vhμ . It can be easily shown that
the coercivity of a(·, ·) implies that the matrix A above is, in fact, symmetric positive deﬁnite
and thus it is invertible. Hence the existence and uniqueness of a solution in Vhμ is established.
At this stage, we list convergence properties of the FEM solution.
Theorem 2.1. The solution uh ∈ Vhμ approximating suﬃciently smooth u in (1) satisﬁes
||u − uh ||0 + h|u − uh |1 ≤ C1 hμ , where || · ||0 and | · |1 are respectively the norm in L2 (0, 1) and
the semi-norm in H 1 (0, 1), and C1 depends on μ and u. Furthermore, if the knot vector t is
quasi-uniform, (namely, there is a constant c0 such that hi > c0 h, for i = 1, · · · , n − 1), then
||u − uh ||∞ ≤ C2 hμ , where C2 depends on u.
Proof of the estimate in the Theorem 2.1 follows the usual arguments in the standard
Galerkin approximation, namely establishing the fact that uh ∈ Vhμ is the best approximation
for u ∈ H μ (0, 1) in |·|1 -norm, and thus the convergence in this sense relies on the approximation
property of Vhμ . We then construct a spline wh ∈ Vhμ which interpolates u at the break points
ti ∈ t, the existence of which is established in [13]. The analysis of approximation property of
Vhμ can now proceed in a manner similar to the typical Lagrangian basis. The convergence in
|| · ||0 uses the Aubin-Nitsche argument, which employs a duality equation. The uniform error
estimate uh has been established in [15].

However, the rates of convergence of uh in the Theorem 2.1 are not the only aspects that
we wish to investigate. The FEM solution uh does not satisfy local conservation, speciﬁcally in
the sense of (2), for which the following local conservation error,

Theorem 2.2 states that despite the failure of FEM solution to satisfy local conservation, it
does indeed inherit approximate local conservation property so that asymptotically as h → 0,
this property becomes more accurate. The accuracy of uh in the sense of ||| · ||| entails how
accurate the approximate velocity is at the boundaries of Ii . Still, it is desirable to gain local
conservative approximate solution for a ﬁxed h. In the next subsection, we propose a post
processing technique that takes uh ∈ Vhμ as an input to produce locally conservative velocity.

2.3

Post processing the FEM approximation

The continuous Galerkin formulation described in Subsection 2.2 is global in nature. As such,
the resulting approximate solution is not locally conservative as stipulated by (2). This subsection is devoted to construction of a post processing technique applied to FEM solution uh that
renders locally conservative velocity.

refer to each of these subintervals as a control volume. In addition, we set
Wh0 = span {χi : 2 ≤ i ≤ n + μ − 2} ,

(15)

where χi is the usual characteristic function associated with Ii . The CVFEM is based on the
statement of local conservation expressed in (2). The approximate solution using CVFEM is

Results and Implementation

We now present the results pertaining to the techniques of solving (1) described in the previous
section for various parameter functions a(x), f (x) and boundary values u0 and g1 . We set
t ∈ Rn to have entries ti = (i − 1)/(n − 1), where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We refer to the quantity
1
as the discretization level of the approximate solution. Also, we set τi = (ti , ti+1 ) for
h = n−1
˜ = h. The approximate solutions are sought in V 3 , i.e., using
i = 1, · · · , n
˜ = n − 1 and hence h
h
quadratic B-splines.
As a consequence, the post processing uses Vh1 . Henceforth, we shall refer to the control
volumes used in the implementation of the post processed solution technique described in Subsection 2.3 as the FEM volumes. The manner in which we deﬁne these FEM volumes for this
set of break points has already been established in Subsection 2.3. We address the issue of
existence and uniqueness of solutions of (14). Indeed, if the function a(x) is bounded away
from zero, then there exists a unique solution to (14). It is easily seen that the resulting system involves an upper triangular matrix with nonzero diagonal entries by observing that both
φj t˜i− 12 = 0 when j < i and φi t˜i− 12 = 12 . Moreover, since this upper triangular matrix has
non-zero diagonal entries, it is thus invertible.
We deﬁne the control volumes used in the implementation of the control volume ﬁnite
element method as described in Subsection 2.4, which shall henceforth be referred to as the
CVFEM volumes, in a similar fashion. We note that dim(Vh3 ) = n and consequently we need n
CVFEM volumes. To fulﬁll this requirement, we use the following subintervals as the CVFEM
volumes:
(0, h/4), (h/4, h/2),

((i − 1/2)h, (i + 1/2)h)

n−2
,
i=1

and (1 − h/2, 1).

We shall collect results for each of the following discretization levels: h = 5·10
i , h = 10i+1 ,
for i = 0, 1, 2. The performance of the methods are quantiﬁed by calculating the errors of the
approximate solutions measured in several metrics. We begin with the usual L2 -norm · 0
and H 1 -seminorm | · |1 . This in particular is useful to conﬁrm the convergence properties of the
ˆh
approximate solutions in the traditional setting. For this purpose, we designate eˆh = u − u
and e˜h = u − u
˜h . We retain the designation of eh = u − uh previously establish in Subsection
2.2. Moreover, the obvious outcome that we desire is whether or not the approximate solutions
satisfy local conservation (2), whose error is expressed as LCE(w(zi )) as deﬁned in Subsection
2.2. In relation to this error, we compute u − w and |||u − w||| as deﬁned in Theorem 2.2
for the control volumes associated with the function w. The latter metric is aimed at looking
into the accuracy of the point-wise value of the velocity, in particular those calculated at the
control volumes boundaries. Having conﬁrmation on this metric will indeed enhance the local
conservation. The former metric is aimed at measuring the accuracy of uh in the sense of
satisfying local conservation. As a result of Theorem 2.2, we expect to see a convergence rate
of 1.5 in the data pertaining to eh and a convergence rate of 2.5 in the data pertaining to
|eh |. Whenever appropriate, the convergence order is investigated by computing the slope of
the least squares regression line for all the error data metrics. We also plot LCE(w) for all h,
which shall consist of plotting LCE(w) at each midpoint of the control volumes associated with
the function w. All examples use a(x) = (1 + 0.9 cos(3πx))−1 .

We can see from the plot in the upper left corner of Figure 3 as well as the incorporated
regression slope that the continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element solution uh exhibits a roughly cubic
ˆh exhibits
rate of convergence in the L2 -norm while the control volume ﬁnite element solution u
merely a quadratic rate of convergence. This may suggest that further study of suitable choices
of the CVFEM volumes is required. The plot in the upper right corner of Figure 3, which shows

The plot on the lower left corner Figure 3, which pertains to | · |, yields a particularly
interesting piece of information. While the plot of |eh | exhibits a convergence rate of approximately 2.5 as expected, the plots of |ˆ

levels h. This would seem to suggest that, while −auh converges to −au point-wise at the

associated with uh which we have just ﬁnished discussing is observed in the plot in the lower
right corner of Figure 3 which pertains to error in satisfying local conservation. We see that
eh exhibits a convergence rate slightly higher than the expected value of 1.5 while stopping
short of a quadratic convergence rate.
This last observation pertaining to satisfying local conservation is echoed by the graphs seen
in Figure 2. As h decreases, we see that the magnitude of LCE(uh ) decreases as well. This

Figure 3, we see that, while uh does not satisfy local conservation for any h, the error associated
with lack of local conservation exhibited by uh converges to zero as h → 0. The approximate

The results we see are comparable to their counterparts in Example #1. We can see from
the plot in the upper left corner of Figure 5, more speciﬁcally from the regression slope, that the

continuous Galerkin ﬁnite element solution uh exhibits a roughly cubic rate of convergence in
the L2 -norm, albeit at a slight reduced rate from the previous example. The slope of the data
from the L2 -norm associated with the control volume ﬁnite element method, on the other hand,
displays a quadratic rate of convergence. It would seem that more suitable CVFEM volumes,
should they exist, may indeed be required to dispel the observed sub-optimal convergence rate.
The observed regression slopes in the plot found in the upper right corner of Figure 5 illustrate
that the approximate solutions preserve their own hierarchy of the magnitude of error seen in
Example #1 in addition to exhibiting a quadratic rate of convergence. In particular, we note
that, as before, |eh |1 < |ˆ
eh |1 < |˜
eh |1 for all discretization levels h.
The plot of |eh | seen in the lower left corner of Figure 5 exhibits the expected convergence
rate of approximately 2.5. Indeed the experimental results once again agree with the expected

eh | remain conresults as they pertain to |eh | while the remaining quantities |ˆ
sistently close to zero across all values of h . Moving on to the ﬁnal plot, we see that eh
exhibits a rate of convergence closer to the expected 1.5 than in the previous example. We note
that, unlike Example #1, the convergence rate of eh does not border on a quadratic rate.
As previously seen in Example #1, we observe that the magnitude of LCE(uh ) decreases as
˜h are purposefully constructed to satisfy local conservation,
h → 0. As the two solutions u
ˆh and u
uh ) in Figure 4 are essentially
it is no surprise that their respective graphs LCE(ˆ
uh ) and LCE(˜
zero for all discretization levels h. These observations aﬃrm that the approximate solutions u
ˆh
and u
˜h do indeed satisfy local conservation for any h and the approximate solution uh simply
diminishes in the severity of its lack of local conservation as h is reﬁned.

Conclusion

In this paper we have implemented two separate B-spline based ﬁnite element solution techniques to problems with smooth parameters a(x) and f (x) which yielded smooth locally conservative solutions. We saw that the standard FEM approximation exhibits an optimal convergence property in the L2 -norm and H 1 -seminorm, but lacks numerical local conservation,
which is a crucial property for simulation of many problems involving conservation principle.
The two numerical techniques proposed in this paper are able to recover this property. While
mathematical analysis for these techniques is outside the scope of current investigation, numerical experiments to seek approximate solutions in Vh3 suggest that a quadratic convergence
rate is observed for the post processed FEM and CVFEM in H 1 -seminorm. In this sense, it
is reasonable to conjecture that the proposed techniques are optimal. Furthermore, examples
for the CVFEM exhibit a quadratic rate of convergence in L2 -norm, indicating a sub-optimal
behavior. We also observed that CVFEM solution was the more accurate of the the two locally
conservative solutions with respect to the H 1 -seminorm. More importantly however, both the
post processed FEM and CVFEM approximations yield very accurate approximations of the
−au at the control volume boundaries and satisfy local conservation as desired. The empirical
data ||||eh |||| and |||eh |||, on the other hand, exhibit a rate of convergence which coincide with
theoretical predictions.
All of the results which have been discussed pertain to problems with smooth solutions.
We have, however, omitted problems with discontinuous parameters a(x). Indeed the methods
proposed above can be applied to such problems. However, the inherent smoothness of the
approximate solutions may in fact cause the observed convergence rates to deteriorate. While
such problems are beyond the scope of this current work, the methods above may be altered
to more eﬀectively service problems with discontinuous a(x). One potential alteration of the
solution techniques would be enriching the respective solution spaces by repeating entries in the
1289

knots vector kμ . By repeating knots on the interior of the domain, we decrease the number of
continuity conditions of the basis splines at the repeated knot.[13] Such splines may well prove
to be well-suited for problems with discontinuous parameters.
In addition to addressing problems with discontinuous parameters, future work would include extending the work to handle diﬀerent boundary conditions, for example, Robin and fully
Dirichlet boundary conditions, extending the work and analysis to higher-dimensional problems
on non-rectangular domains, and applying these B-spline based techniques to time dependent
problems. Applying the techniques discussed in this paper to multi-dimensional problems on
non-rectangular domains would likely proceed in the spirit of works completed by [9] and or
[10]. Further work would also include probing further into options for the control volumes for
the CVFEM approximation in an eﬀort to alleviate the sub-optimal convergence rate seen in
the L2 -norm.
