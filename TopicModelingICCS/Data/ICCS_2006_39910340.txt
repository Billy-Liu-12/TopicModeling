Abstract. Optimum multiuser detection (OMD) for CDMA systems is an NPcomplete problem. Fitness landscape has been proven to be very useful for
understanding the behavior of combinatorial optimization algorithms and can
help in predicting their performance. This paper analyzes the statistic properties
of the fitness landscape of the OMD problem by performing autocorrelation
analysis, fitness distance correlation test and epistasis measure. The analysis
results, including epistasis variance, correlation length and fitness distance
correlation coefficient in different instances, explain why some random search
algorithms are effective methods for the OMD problem and give hints how to
design more efficient randomized search heuristic algorithms for it. Based on
these results, a multi-start greedy algorithm is proposed for multiuser detection
and simulation results show it can provide rather good performance for cases
where other suboptimum algorithms perform poorly.

1 Introduction
Multiple access interference (MAI) is the main factor limiting performance in CDMA
systems. While optimum multiuser detection (OMD) [1], which is based on the
maximum likelihood sequence estimation rule, is the most promising technique for
mitigating MAI, its computational complexity increases exponentially with the
number of active users, which leads to its implementation impractical.
From a combinatorial optimization viewpoint, the OMD is an NP-complete
problem [2]. Randomized search heuristics (RSH) are effective methods for such
kinds of problems, so many RSH based multiuser detectors have been studied and
exhibit better performance than that of the other linear or nonlinear detectors. Earlier
works on applying RSH to OMD problem can be found in [3][4][5][6][7].The essence
of optimum multiuser detection is to search for possible combinations of the users’
entire transmitted bit sequence that maximizes the logarithm likelihood function
(LLF) derived from the maximum likelihood sequence estimation rule [1], which is
called fitness function or objective function in the RSH multiuser detectors.
Comparing with so much emphasis on the implementation details and the
performance analysis of these algorithms, little attention has been paid on the analysis
of statistic characteristics of the OMD problem in terms of combinatorial
optimization.

Landscape Properties and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm for OMD Problem

341

Fitness landscape has been proven to be a power concept in combinatorial
optimization theory [8][9][10]. Moreover, the concept can be used to understand the
behavior of heuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems and to
predict their performance. In this paper, we formulate the fitness landscapes of OMD
problem by taking the LLF as the objective function and analyze their local and
global characteristics as well as gene interaction properties [11][12]. With the analysis
results, we propose a multi-start greedy (MSG) multiuser detector and compare its
performance with other detectors.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect.2, we state the OMD
problem and construct its fitness landscape. Statistic properties of the fitness landscape,
including autocorrelation function, fitness distance correlation and epistasis variance,
are described in Sect.3 with analysis results. In Sect.4, we propose the MSG algorithm
and compare its performance with others. A short conclusion is given in Sect.5.

2.1 Optimum Multiuser Detection Problem
Assume a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) transmission through an additive-whiteGaussian-noise (AWGN) channel shared by K active users with packet size M in an
asynchronous DS-CDMA system (synchronous system is the special case of the
asynchronous one ). The sufficient statistics for demodulation of the transmitted bits
b are given by MK matched filter outputs y [13]

2.2 Fitness Landscape of OMD Problem
The notion of fitness landscape comes from biology, where it is used as a framework
for thinking about evolution. Landscape theory has emerged as an attempt to devise
suitable mathematical structures for describing the static properties of landscape as
well as their influence on the dynamics of adaptation [10].
In formal terms, a fitness landscape consists of three ingredients: A set S of
possible solutions, the notion of element distance d in S and a fitness
function f : S → \ . So the fitness landscape of OMD problem can be defined as
follows.
1. The solution space S : {−1,1}

is the packet size.

3.1.1 The Random Walk Correlation Function
To measure the ruggedness of a fitness landscape, Weinberger [8] suggests the use of
random walk correlation function

xt is a time series and f ( xt ) defines the

correlation of two points s steps away along random walk through the fitness
landscape, −1 ≤ r ( s ) ≤ 1 . Then the normalized correlation length l is defined as
l = − N × ln( r (1) )

(7)

for r (1) ≠ 0 , N is the dimension of S .
3.1.2 The Fitness Distance Correlation
Fitness distance correlation (FDC) coefficient is another measure for problem
difficulty for heuristic algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms [9]. Denote the
shortest distance between a possible solution and the global optimum solution as d ,
the FDC coefficient ρ is defined as

Though the fitness landscape of OMD problem is dynamic because of the changes
of E N and K , from Table 1, we can see the statistics of the fitness landscape
b

0

( l , ρ , EpiN and EpiC ) vary within a narrow range. The FDC coefficient ρ keeps
negative value close to −1 , which means the LLF is appropriate as the cost function
for heuristics based multiuser detector. The normalized correlation length l is almost
the same in all cases, which gives hints how to select the neighborhood size in
heuristics. For example, k = 2 is appropriate for the k − opt multiuser detector [6]and
may give the best tradeoff between performance and computational complexity,
because l is close to 2.
Table 1 also shows that EpiN and EpiC change very little when E N and K vary
b

0

within a wide range and the value of EpiN is relatively small, which means the
epistasis of the LLF is very weaker and the fitness value of a possible solution is almost
determined independently by each bit of the solution vector. Therefore greedy heuristic
method may be very efficient local search algorithm for OMD problem [3][5].

4 Multi-Start Greedy Algorithm for Multiuser Detection
4.1 Multi-Start Greedy Algorithm
The MSG algorithm consists of three phases. Phase 1, generate n initial solutions
distributed in the whole solution space randomly. This phase is consider as multi-start
process which imitates the population of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Phase 2,
perform greedy local search algorithm on each solution and produce n local optima.

This phase is a local search process. Phase 3, choose the best one (based on their
fitness) from these local optima as the global optimum solution.
The greedy local search algorithm in phase 2 can be described as follows. Without
loss the generality, for a current solution vector b

= [b1 , b2 ,..., bN ] , where N is

the length of the solution vector, denote the vector with only the jth bit different from

(11)

for j = 1, 2, ..., N , here f is defined in equation (5). Then each bit of the next solution
t

vector b can be updated as

⎧⎪−bkt −1 if k = arg{max g tj−1} and g tj−1 > 0

t −1
⎪⎩bk otherwise

(12)

This process is repeated until a local optimal is obtained (there are no better solutions
that are in its neighborhood).
4.2 Simulation Results

The BER performance of the conventional detector (CD), evolutionary programming
detector (EP) [4], gradient guided detector (GGD) [5], parallel interference
cancellation (PIC) detector [14] and the proposed MSG is illustrated in Fig.1 by the
curves of BER versus Eb N 0 . The number of users is 10 and 20 ( K = 10, 20 ) in
Fig.1(a) and (b) respectively and the packet size is 3 ( M = 3 ). It is obvious that MSG
detector outperforms other detectors.

The computational complexity of MSG can be determined easily. The initialization
is to generate

n random vector and requires computations of O (n) . Each local

optimal requires n × ( n − 1) 2 fitness value computations. So the computational
2

complexity of a local optimal is O ( n ) and the computational complexity of MSG
3

is O ( n ) . A fast greedy heuristic is proposed in [15]. With this method, a local
optimal can be obtained in O ( n) . Then the computational complexity of MSG can be
2

reduced to O ( n ) .

5 Conclusions
This paper studies the important statistic properties of the fitness landscape of the
OMD problem and proposes a multi-start greedy algorithm based multiuser detector.
The analysis results about the fitness landscape explain why some heuristics multiuser
detector are effective and give hints how to design more efficient randomized search
heuristics for the OMD problem. The multi-start greedy algorithm which is founded
on these analysis results can provide good performance for cases where other
suboptimum algorithms perform poorly.
