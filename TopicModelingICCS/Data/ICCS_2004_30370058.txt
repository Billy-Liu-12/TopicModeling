Abstract. In this paper, we improve A-P iterative algorithm, and use
the algorithm to implement the reconstruction from weighted samples,
and obtain explicit convergence rate of the algorithm in spline subspaces.

Introduction

For a bandlimited signal of ﬁnite energy, it is completely described by the famous
classical Shannon sampling theorem. This classical theorem has broad application in signal processing and communication theory and has been generalized
to many other forms. However, in many real applications sampling points are
not always regularly. It is well-known that in the sampling and reconstruction
problem for non-bandlimited spaces, signal is often assumed to belong to a shiftinvariant spaces[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]. As the special shift-invariant spaces, spline
subspaces yield many advantages in their generation and numerical treatment
so that there are many practical applications for signal or image processing[1, 2,
3, 9].
For practical application and computation of reconstruction, Goh et al., show
practical reconstruction algorithm of bandlimited signals from irregular samples
in [11], Aldroubi et al., present a A-P iterative algorithm in [5]. In this paper, we
improve the A-P iterative algorithm in spline subspaces. The improved algorithm
occupies better convergence than the old one.

Improved A-P Iterative Algorithm in VN

Aldroubi presented A-P iterative algorithm in [5]. In this section, we will improve
the algorithm. The improved algorithm occupies faster convergence. We will
discuss the cases of non-weighted samples and weighted samples, respectively.

In the following, we will show improved A-P iterative algorithm from

Theorem 2.2 Let P be an orthogonal projection from L2 (R) to VN and
weight function satisfy the following three conditions (i)-(iii):

The above second equality derives from ϕxj (x)dx = 1. By |ϕxj (x)|dx ≤ M

Remark 1. Term ( 12 )n is added in the expression of convergence rate. This improves the velocity of convergence. From the construction of operator Q and A,
we know why it appears in the expression of convergence rate.
The reconstruction algorithm in Theorem 2.1 and 2.2 require the existence of
orthogonal projection from L2 onto VN . For this purpose, the following Theorem
2.3 will construct the orthogonal projection. We can ﬁnd the similar proof of
Theorem 2.3 in [5, 10].

Theorem 2.3 Let X = {xn } be a real sequence such that 0 < supi (xi+1 −
xi ) = δ < 1. Then
Pf =

xj ∈X

is orthogonal projection from L onto VN , where {kxj } and {k˜xj }.

Remark 2. : The above improved A-P iterative algorithm maybe be generalized
to the case of Lp (R) and V p (ϕ) whenever generator ϕ belongs to W0 (L1 ). We
will study it in future work.

Conclusion

In this paper we pay main attention on the weighted sampling and reconstruction in spline subspaces. We give some reconstruction methods from diﬀerent
weighted sampling in spline subspaces. The improved A-P iterative algorithm
performs better than the old A-P algorithm. And we obtain the explicit convergence rate of the improved A-P iterative algorithm in spline subspaces.
