Abstract. An x-ray image intensifier (XRII) has many applications in
diagnostic imaging, especially in real time. Unfortunately the inherent and
external distortions (pincushion, S-distortion and local distortion) hinder any
quantitative analysis of an image. In this paper an automatic real-time local
distortion correction method for improving the quality of digital linear
tomography images is presented. Using a digital signal processing (DSP), this
method can work for an image up to 1Kx1Kx12 bit at 30fps. A local correction
method has been used because it allows distortions such as those caused by
poor axial alignment between the X-Ray cone beam and the XRII input surface
and local distortions to be resolved that are generally neglected by global
methods.

Introduction
Linear tomography is a helpful diagnostic exam that permits the acquisition of an xray relative to any plane, parallel to the x-ray table. However, inherent and external
disturbances on the acquisition system chain cause several distortions when images
are acquired by means of a digital system (XRII coupled with a CCD camera) [1][2].
The aim of this work is the development of an automatic real-time method for the
correction of geometric distortions in digital linear tomography applications. A local
correction algorithm has been used because it guarantees an efficient distortion
correction only where needed. Geometric distortions considered and corrected here
are: S-distortion, pincushion distortion, asymmetrical and misaligned axes, and local
distortion.

Material and Methods
The method needs a preliminary calibration setup based on the acquisition of a radio
2
opaque square metal grid. For this work a 5x5 mm cell size and a 2 mm metal wire
thickness have been chosen, but no restrictions are imposed by the method. The
acquisition-system consisted of 16” XRII tube coupled with a 1Kx1Kx 12bit CCD
mounted on GMM Opera X-Ray table. The KV and mAs have been selected for

guaranteeing an optimal contrast between grid and background with no image
saturation. The DSP used for real-time application was a Matrox Genesis© PCI board
working under Windows NT O.S..

Automatic Grid Detection and Classification
Unlike other wire intersection point detection methods [3], this method uses as control
points, the grid cells’ Centers Of Gravity (COG) calculated from the acquired grid
image by using a hardware blob analysis technique. This results in a reduction in the
sensitivity to noise during control point set up. In order to exclude imperfect
information about image cells across a radiographic circle, a preliminary circular
region threshold has been applied. After thresholding, the method begins to classify
the principal distorted axes, starting from the central COG. Cell classification has
been obtained by an iterative procedure which is able to find the COG closest to a
classified one along a desired direction, starting from a classified one. Nearest
neighborhood COG can be found even if its position is shifted up to half a side of an
expected square. The minimum distorted axis length is used to define the maximal
squared region size where correction is applied. Once the principal axes are
calculated, their information are used to classify all the COGs belonging to each
quadrant region included in the square-shaped regions. Due to the presence of the
radiographic circle and in order to guarantee the maximal dimension of the correction
area, external circle COG cells are estimated by means of bilinear interpolation.
Classified and estimated COG coordinates are ordered into a matrix. The central cell’s
area and COG are used to estimate the default cell and wire size parameters useful for
the correction algorithm.

Correction Algorithm
The correction algorithm uses two matrixes of COG points in order to create two biDimensional Look Up Tables (2D LUT) used by a DSP to perform a real-time
distortion correction. The first matrix (DM) containing distorted COG coordinates is
obtained from the above described grid classification procedure. The second matrix
(CM) is filled with corresponding corrected COG coordinates calculated using the
default parameters (default cell and wire sizes), starting from the central distorted
COG position. Each polygon formed by four adjacent elements (COG points)
contained in the first matrix defines each single distorted local area. In the second
matrix, the corresponding corrected square local area is defined by four elements
located in the same matrix coordinates (see black points in Fig.1.). Each local area is
corrected by using a 2D polynomial function characterized by 20 parameters. In order
to calculate all parameters, sixteen COG points have been used: four concerning the
local area and twelve belonging to the boundary of the square region. The COG
information of the boundaries has been used to improve image continuity across
neighboring local areas. The parameters obtained for each local area are used to create
a 2D LUT that is used by the DSP image’s real-time correction.

Linear Tomography Correction
The acquisition procedure, when traditional films are used, consists of continuous
image integration during generator tilting (�20 degrees) and film shifting. The result
is an x-ray image focused on a plane that is parallel to the table at the center of
rotation. When digital equipment is used, the film is replaced by an XRII and a CCD
and continuous integration is replaced by a discrete image integration. As noted
before, due to XRII disturbance, each frame’s results are affected by both typical
XRII distortions as well as by angular distortions (see Fig.2a).

As a consequence, the linear tomography obtained by frames integration, with no
correction, is highly smoothed and distorted (see Fig.2c). Ideally, in order to obtain a
correct digital linear tomography image, each frame should be corrected by means of
an angularly dependent global LUT before integration, but that would be time and
computationally intensive. The method used and presented in this paper is based on
the hypothesis that S-distortion and pincushion distortion are invariant during
generator tilting. With this assumption, only one 2D global LUT was calculated when
an x-ray cone beam axis was perpendicular to the XRII input surface. The residual
angular warping is corrected by fast global cosine correction method. In Fig.2b a
corrected single frame, where the distortion and warping are substantially reduced, is
shown. Comparing Fig.2c and Fig.2d, it is possible to note how the XRII disturbance,
especially the S-distortion and pincushion distortions, deform and rotate the image
reducing its quality.

Conclusion
An automatic local method to correct XRII image distortion in order to increase
digital linear tomography image quality has been developed. Neither a grid cell size
limit, or distortion information are needed in order to create 2D global LUT, with the
exception of neighbor shift limit condition. Local correction allows the reduction of
local distortions without significant modification to the rest of image. Image
continuity has been guaranteed by using information about neighbor bounding cells.
In simulated and real image tests, the residual distance mean errors were about 2.5%
of the initial ones, corresponding to about 0.38 mm. It is expected that the use of a
higher grid cell number can further reduce the residual error. The method is based on
the hypothesis that the S and pincushion distortions are invariant during linear
tomography acquisition. By using a DSP after set up procedure, this method
guarantees a real time operation with resolution up to 1024x1024x12 bits. The method
is completely self-setting, meaning that it can be directly hardware implemented as
part of CCD camera. Its notable generality also permits its use in a wide range of
image processing applications, not only in digital x-ray.
