Abstract. We study the ﬁnal/initial behavior of a dust Universe with
spatial spherical symmetry. This study is done in proximity of the collapse/generation times by an expansion in fractional Puiseux series. Even
if the evolution of the universe has diﬀerent behaviours depending on the
initial data (in particular on the initial spatial curvature), we show that,
in proximity of generation or collapse time, the Universe expands or collapses with the same behavior.
Keywords: Spherical Universe, Fractional Puiseux series, generation/
collapse time.

Introduction

In this paper we consider an Universe with spatial spherical symmetry
around a physical point O and we analyze its behavior in proximity of the
collapse/generation times. In this analysis we use an expansion of the exact
solution of evolution equations in fractional power series (Puiseaux series).1
In particular we introduce the ﬁrst principal curvature ω1 of the initial spatial
manifold V3 into the evolution equations and we consider these equations in the
three diﬀerent cases of null, positive and negative principal curvature.
In other words, in a short range of times, it is impossible to distinguish the
evolution of the Universe from the Euclidean case (where ω1 = 0).
Moreover this result allows the generalization of some of the results found
in the previous papers [4], [8] in the spatially euclidean case (at least in an a
suitable interval of time), also to the not euclidean case.

Evolution Equations

Since in the following we are going to consider dust universes with spatial spherical symmetry, we want to brieﬂy summarize the previous main results in a form
inspired by [3,4].

We will consider a dust system C which generates, during its evolution, a
riemannian manifold, which has locally spatial spherical symmetry around a
physical point O;2 the metric can then be given the form [1,2]:3
ds2 = gαβ dxα dxβ = A2 (t, r)dr2 + B 2 (t, r)(dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 ) − c2 dt2 ,

(1)

where t is the proper time of each particle, r, θ, ϕ are co–moving spherical
coordinates and we can interpret B(t, r) as the intrinsic radius of the O–sphere
S(r) at time t [1, Chap. XII, §11 p.411].4
We consider now the initial space-like hypersurface V3 (with equation t = 0)
and call r–shells the set of particles with co–moving radius r (i.e. the dust initially
distributed on the surface of the geodesic sphere with center at O and radius r
(O–sphere) S(r)); in accordance with [3,4] we assign each particle of an r–shell
the initial intrinsic radius B(0, r) as radial co–moving coordinate r
B(0, r) = r .

(2)

If we put a(r) = A(0, r), the metric of the initial O–sphere V3 takes the form:
dσ 2 = γij dxi dxj = a2 (r)dr2 + r2 (dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2 ) ,

(3)

where γij ≡ gij is the metric tensor of V3 . If we introduce the ﬁrst principal
curvature of V3 , ω1 (r) =

The ﬁrst principal curvature is very important for studying the geometrical
property of V3 in fact, as underlined in the paper [9,10], it completely determines
its curvature properties.

See [1, Chap. XII, §11 p.408] for a precise deﬁnition of spherical symmetry around
a point O.
In accordance with [1] (but diﬀerently from [3,4]) the latin indices will vary from 1
to 3, whereas the greek indices will vary from 1 to 4.
At any point B12 represents the gaussian curvature of the geodesic sphere with its
centre at the centre of symmetry O and passing through the point [1, Chap. XII,
§11 p.410].
Hereafter a dot will denote diﬀerentiation with respect to t and a prime diﬀerentiation with respect to r.

Remark 1. In [4] it was demonstrated that given a spherical dust universe, for
each material r–shell there exists a corresponding time T (r) at which the dust
distributed on the r–shell is collapsed into the symmetry center, so that we have
a function t = T (r) which satisﬁes B(T (r), r) = 0.6

Exact Solutions of Evolution Equations in Three
Diﬀerent Cases

Now we will focus our attention on a given single r-shell (that is we will consider
r as a given ﬁxed parameter), so we can regard the intrinsic radius B = B(t; r) as
a function of time only, and r , ω1 (r) , m(r) as constants. By introducing the new
and the function k(r) = GNrm(r)
(which we

r
will consider constant being r is a given ﬁxed parameter), equation (4)2 becomes

In the following we will put
= |ω1 | and will consider separately the three
> 0 and ω1 = − < 0, to get the corresponding exact
cases ω1 = 0, ω1 =
solutions. The case ω1 = 0 corresponds to the Euclidean case a2 (r) = 1, already
studied in [4]; it is the only case where it is possible to solve (4)2 explicitly for
B. Since ω1 (r) = 0, equation (4)2 becomes

Remark 2. For t = τ (r) ⇒ Y = 0 ⇒ B = 0 and we know, from remark 2,
that for each r exists a unique instant T (r) which satisﬁes B(r, T (r)) = 0, where
T (r) is the time at which the dust distributed on the r-shell is collapsed into the
symmetry center, so we have t = T (r) and consequently τ (r) ≡ T (r).
We can calculate the function τ (r) ≡ T (r) through the initial values B(0; r) =

Study of the Behaviour of the Universe in Proximity
of the Collapse/Generation Times by an Expansion in
Fractional Power Series

Now we want to study the behaviour of the universe in proximity of the collapse/expansion times by an expansion in fractional (Puiseux) series.7
Remark 5. In proximity of the times of generation or collapse the evolution has
the same behaviour apart from its initial geometry. In addition the function
T (r) has approximately the same form in all of the three diﬀerent cases ω1 = 0,
ω1 > 0 and ω1 < 0.
4.1

Initial Principal Curvature ω1 Positive

We already remarked that it is not possible to solve (14) explicitly with respect
to B, but we can approximate the exact solution by an opportune fractional
power series (or Puiseux series):8

In [11] the approximate explicit solution was obtained through an expansion in power
series of the parametric equations, therefore by a double expansion in power series.
It is not possible to expand the second member of (14) in a simple power series
√ with
respect to Y , but we can develop it in Mac Lauren series with respect to Y thus
obtaining a fractional power series. As it is known the fractional power series are
particular cases of Puiseux series (see e.g. [5]).

So in our approximation we found the same expression (8) that characterizes
the case ω1 = 0: in proximity of the generation or collapse times, the r-shells
expand or collapse with the same behaviour as in the case ω1 = 0 and the
function T (r) has, approximately, the form (9), in agreement with [11].
4.2

Initial Principal Curvature ω1 Negative

Also in this case, being not possible to solve (20) explicitly with respect to B,
we can approximate the exact solution by a Puiseux series:

(27)

So in our approximation we found again the same equation that characterizes
the case ω1 = 0: in proximity of the generation or collapse times, the r-shells
expand or collapse with the same behavior that in the case ω1 = 0. Moreover, also in this case, the function T (r) has, approximately, the form (9) (see
also [11]).
