Abstract. A spectral element method coupled with the EVSS method
for computing viscoelastic ﬂows is presented. The nonlinear rheological
model, Oldroyd-B, is chosen to simulate the ﬂow of a viscoelastic ﬂuid
based on a planar four-to-one abrupt contraction benchmark problem.
Numerical results agree well with those in the previous publications.

Introduction

Non-Newtonian ﬂuids, such as multi-grade oils, liquid detergents, polymer melts
and molten plastics, are becoming more and more important in many industrial ﬂuids applications. Viscoelastic ﬂuids are non-Newtonian ﬂuids that possess
memory. That is, the stress of the ﬂuid depends not only on the stresses actually
impressed on them at present, but also on all the stresses to which they have
been subjected during their previous deformation history. These ﬂuids are special
case of non-Newtonian ﬂuids that lie somewhere in between elastic materials and
standard Newtonian ﬂuids. The numerical simulation of such viscoelastic ﬂuids
is becoming an eﬀective technique to predict the ﬂuid performance in a wide
range of engineering applications.
Most mathematical problems that arise in modeling viscoelastic ﬂows involve the solutions of non-linear partial diﬀerential, integro-diﬀerential or integral equations. In general, these equations cannot be solved analytically, so
numerical methods are required to obtain solutions. The rapid growth in the
power and availability of computers has led to the development of many algorithms for solving these equations. Recently, the spectral element method has
emerged in the viscoelastic context as a powerful alternative to more traditional
methods in predicting ﬂow behaviour in complex ﬂuids. In this paper we mainly
focus on the development of an eﬃcient spectral element technique to simulate
a viscoelastic ﬂow in a contraction channel.
Contraction ﬂows of viscoelastic ﬂuids are of importance in fundamental ﬂow
property measurements as well as in many industrial applications [1]. The theoretical prediction of entry-ﬂow for non-Newtonian ﬂuids still is a diﬃcult task.

The diﬃculty comes from two aspects. One is the constitutive equations that
are used to express the relationship between the stress tensor and the velocity
gradient and describe the rheological behaviour of viscoelastic ﬂuids which have
memory eﬀects and contain nonlinear terms that add to the complexity of the
problem; the other one is a geometrical singularity at the re-entrant corner. The
research has been dominated by the study of the high Weissenberg numbers and
continues to be a benchmark problem in the computational rheology.
In recent years, successful numerical methods have emerged. These include
the Hermitian ﬁnite element method [7], the 4×4 subelement method [8], the explicitly elliptic momentum equation formulation (EEME) [5], the elastic viscous
split stress formulation (EVSS) [10], the consistent streamline upwind PetrovGalerkin method (SUPG) [4] and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method [3].
In this paper, we will present a spectral element formulation to solve the OldroydB viscoelastic ﬂow based on a four-to-one contraction benchmark problem. In
section 2, the full set of governing equations for the viscoelastic ﬂow model is presented. The spectral element method is described in section 3, numerical results
and discussion are presented in the last section.

Mathematical Modeling

The isothermal ﬂow of an incompressible viscoelastic ﬂuid is governed by a set
of conservation and constitutive equations. In the absence of body force, the
momentum and mass equations can be written as follows
�

∂u
+ u · ∇u = −∇p + ∇ · τ ,
(2.1)
ρ
∂t
∇ · u = 0,

(2.2)

where ρ is the ﬂuid density, p is the pressure, u is the velocity vector, and τ
is the extra-stress tensor ﬁeld. Equations (2.1) and (2.2) must be closed with a
constitutive model. In this paper, the Oldroyd-B model is used and deﬁned as
∇

∇

τ + λ1 τ = 2η(D + λ2 D),

(2.3)

where λ1 is the relaxation time, λ2 is the retardation time and η is the shear rate
∇

viscosity. D and τ are the rate of deformation tensor and the upper-convected
derivative of the viscoelastic extra-stress, respectively. They are deﬁned as
D=

1
(∇u + (∇u)T ),
2

∂τ
+ u · ∇τ − τ · (∇u) − (∇u)T · τ .
∂t
Note that equation (2.3) reduces to the upper-convected Maxwell (UCM) model
if λ2 = 0 and to a Newtonian liquid with viscosity η if λ1 = λ2 . The viscoelastic
stress tensor can be split into
∇

τ=

τ = τ 1 + τ 2,

(2.4)

854

where τ 1 denotes the elastic part of the viscoelastic stress deﬁned as
∇

τ 1 + λτ 1 = 2η1 D,
and τ 2 represents the purely viscous component deﬁned as
τ 2 = 2η2 D.
in these equations η1 is the viscosity of the viscoelastic contribution and η2 is
the viscosity of the Newtonian contribution.
Substituting (2.4) into (2.3), we obtain the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation

T
+ u · ∇τ 1 − τ 1 · (∇u) − (∇u) · τ 1 = η1 (∇u + (∇u)T ). (2.5)

Let d be an additional unknown
d=D=

and replace τ 1 by τ , we obtain (u, p, τ , d) in the EVSS formulation

Although we add the same quantity in the right hand side of the momentum
equation, the real modiﬁcation will be appear when we consider diﬀerent representations for d and D in the discrete form of the above system of equations.

The Spectral Element Discretization

The spectral element method is a high-order weighted-residual technique for
partial diﬀerential equations that combines the rapid convergence rate of the ptype spectral method with the geometric ﬂexibility of the h-type ﬁnite element
technique. In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is
broken into macro-spectral elements, and the dependent and independent variables are represented as high-order orthogonal polynomial expansions within
the individual subdomains. Variational projection operators and Gauss-Lobatto
Legendre numerical quadratures are used to generate the discrete equations,
which are then solved by direct or iterative procedures using tensor-product
sum-factorization techniques [6].
In order to obtain a weak formulation which is equivalent to the equations
(2.10) − (2.13), we introduce the following function spaces:
H01 (Ω) = {φ : φ ∈ H 1 (Ω), φ = 0 on ∂Ω}, L20 (Ω) = {v : v ∈ L2 (Ω), v = 0 on ∂Ω},

where H 1 (Ω) is Soblev space, L2 (Ω) is the space of square integrable functions.
The scalar product can be deﬁned as
�
φ(x)ψ(x)dx, ∀φ, ψ ∈ H 1 (Ω).
(φ, ψ) =
Ω

The spectral element discretization proceeds by breaking up the computational domain Ω into K non-overlapping sub-domains denoted by Ωk , (k =
1, ..., K) such that Ω = ∪Ωk , ∀k, l, k � =l, Ωk ∩ Ωl = ∅. Each physical element
is mapped onto the parent element χ2 = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1], on which a GaussLobatto-Legendre grid is used. We further deﬁne
Xh = {u : u|Ω ∈ PN (Ω)} ∩ H01 (Ω), Mh = {p : p|Ω ∈ PN −2 (Ω)} ∩ L20 (Ω),
where PN (Ω) denotes the space of all polynomials of degree N or less. It is well
known that a choice for the velocity in Xh and the pressure in Mh above avoids
spurious pressure nodes and satisﬁes generalized the Brezzi-Babuska condition
[2]. In addition, the second compatibility condition needs to be satisﬁed for
the stress and the rate of deformation tensor spaces. In this paper, we choose
Th = Xh and Dh = Mh in order to have a well-posed solution. Then the spectral
element discretization is:
Find ui,h ∈ Xh , ph ∈ Mh , τij,h ∈ Th and dij,h ∈ Dh such that

where LN is the Legendre polynomial of order N , the points ξi are the collocation

where ukpq = u(ξpk , φkq ), τpq

that a suitable choice for the pressure approximation space is Mh when the
velocity is Xh . Therefore, in this paper, we choose the pressure function in the
space Mh and expand it on the interior Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points as shown
in Fig. 1. Thus the pressure approximation can be written as

where dkpq = d(ξpk , φkq ).
The velocity, pressure, stress and deformation tensor expansions (3.5) − (3.8)
are now inserted into equations (3.1) − (3.4) and the discrete equations are
generated by choosing appropriate test functions ū and τ̄ in Xh whose values at
a point (ξp , φq ) are unity and zero at all other Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points,
and test functions q and d̄ in Mh whose values are unity at point (ξp , φq ) and
zero at all other interior Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points. In this way we obtain
the system of algebraic equations
Au − B T p = f,
−B · u = 0,
Cτ = g,

Ed = h,
where A is the discrete Helmholtz operator, B is the discrete gradient operator,
C is the stress tensor matrix, E is the deformation tensor matrix, f, g, h are the
right hand side vectors, which are incorporated with boundary conditions.

Step 1: calculate the pressure pn from the conservation equation by the Uzawa
method [6].

Step 5: check the convergence and return to step 1 if necessary.

Numerical Results

In this section, numerical results are presented for a four-to-one abrupt planar
contraction. We adopt the ratio β = 19 in order to compare with already published results. The diﬃculty of the four-to-one planar contraction problem is the
existence of a singular solution which is caused by the geometric singularity at
the re-entrant corner. The singularity in the viscoelatic ﬂow is stronger than in
the Newtonian ﬂow.
Since the geometry is assumed to be symmetric about the central line, we
need only consider the lower half of the channel. Fig. 2 shows the ﬂow geometry.
The height of the inﬂow half channel is taken as unity and the height of outﬂow
channel is taken to be a = 14 . The length of inﬂow channel is taken to be 16 as is
the length of outﬂow channel. Deﬁne U = 1 and L = 1, where U is the average
velocity in the downstream half channel and L is the width of the downstream
half channel, which gives We = λ1 .
We assume the fully developed Poiseuille ﬂow at the inlet and outlet, the
no-slip condition, u = v = 0, is applied on the solid boundaries, and v = 0 and
∂u
∂y = 0 on the axis of symmetry. The boundary conditions for the stresses along
the solid boundaries and inlet are derived from the steady state constitutive
equations. At the exit we have Neumann boundary conditions for the stress
variables

Two diﬀerent meshes depicted in Fig. 3 were used in the numerical simulations. Mesh1 consists of 5 elements, on each element there are 12 collocation
points in the x-direction and 4 collocation points in the y-direction. Mesh2 has
3 elements, there are 18 collocation points in the x-direction and 6 collocation
points in the y-direction on each element. We can see that the meshes created by
the spectral element method are non-uniform, being reﬁned near the re-entrant
corner singularity.

The numerical stability has been tested for the Newtonian ﬂow (λ1 = 0)
based on a (u, p, τ , d) formulation and numerical results agree well with the corresponding calculation by the velocity-pressure formulation. Fig. 4 shows contours of the stream function and the velocity proﬁles.
Now we consider the calculations in the viscoelastic case. The results on
all the meshes have been computed with Δt = 0.001 and Re = 1. The length
of the salient corner vortex L1 , the width of the salient corner vortex L2 and
the maximum value of the stream function ϕmax are shown in Table 1 for We
from 0.1 to 1.2. We found that when We increases from 0 to 0.6, the length of
the corner vortex, L1 , is constant, while the width of the corner vortex, L2 , is
increased. But when We increases from 0.7 to 1.2, L1 decreases slightly, and L2
remains constant. The size of corner vortex compares well quantitatively with
the results of [9,11]. Contour plots of vorticity for We = 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0 in Mesh1
are shown in Fig. 5. These vorticity plots show that our numerical results are in
good agreement with those obtained by [11].
The streamlines are plotted in Fig. 6 for We = 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0. In Fig. 7 the
values of total stress components τxy , τxx and τyy along the line y = −1 are given
for We = 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0. The maximum values of τxy and τyy at the corner are
slightly increased when the value of We is increased. A huge increase occurs in
the value of τxx from approximately 4.5 when We = 0.1, to approximately 49
when We = 1.0.
All accurate results have been presented up to We = 1.2. Since for high We
number, it becomes more diﬃcult to obtain fully developed velocity and stress
ﬁelds, further work needs to be done in this area.
