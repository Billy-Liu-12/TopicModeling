Abstract. We propose a deterministic two-scale tissue-cellular approach
for modeling growth factor-induced angiogenesis. The bioreaction and
diﬀusion of capillary growth factors (CGF) are modeled at a tissue scale,
whereas capillary extension, branching and anastomosis are modeled at
a cellular scale. The capillary indicator function is used to bridge these
two scales. To solve the equation system numerically, we construct a twogrid algorithm that involves applying a mixed ﬁnite element method to
approximate concentrations of CGF on a coarse mesh and a point-topoint tracking method to simulate sprout branching and anastomosis on
a ﬁne grid. An analysis of the algorithm establishes optimal error bounds
for each of the processes – CGF reaction-diﬀusion, capillary extension,
sprout branching and anastomosis – and overall error bounds for their
coupled nonlinear interactions.

Introduction

Angiogenesis is the outgrowth of new vessels from pre-existing vasculature, and
it plays an important role in numerous clinical indications, including wound
healing, tissue regeneration and cancer. A deep understanding of angiogenesis
is critical for reparative strategies since the capillary network dictates tissue
survival, hemodynamics, and mass transport. The angiogenic system is strongly
nonlinear, possessing multiple, integrated modulators and feedback loops. This
complexity limits the in vitro and in vivo experiments that may be designed and
the amount of non-confounding information that can be gleaned. Consequently,
computational models simulating the intercellular growth patterns of capillaries
within a tissue are essential to understanding and analyzing these phenomena.
However, most angiogenesis modeling approaches in the literature have been
restricted to a single scale (e.g., see [1, 2, 3]), even though, in fact, the genetic,
biochemical, cellular, biophysical and physiological processes in angiogenesis are
intimately and tightly coupled across spatial and temporal dimensions.

simulation time. The capillary network is represented by an indicator binary
function n = n(x, t). Denote by ci , i = 1, 2, · · · , NCGF , the concentration of a
species of capillary growth factors (CGF), where NCGF is the number of CGF
components.
2.1

A Tissue Scale Model for CGF Behaviors

We assume that CGF component j is released in the extracellular matrix at a
rate αj . The diﬀusivity of CGF is denoted by Dj , a general second order tensor,
and the diﬀusive ﬂux of CGF is qj = −Dj ∇cj . The consumption (binding) of
CGF by endothelial cells occurs only in the place where n = 1, and its rate is
assumed to be proportional to the CGF concentration. Thus the consumption
rate is λj ncj , where λj is the consumption parameter of CGF j. We model
the natural decay of CGF by a rate λ∗j cj . The mass balance of CGF yields the
following equation: ∂cj /∂t = ∇ · (Dj ∇cj ) + αj (1 − n) − λj ncj − λ∗j cj .
2.2

A Cellular Scale Model for Capillary Dynamics

We model sprout extension by tracking the trajectory of individual capillary
tips. We denote by pi (t) ∈ Rd the position of capillary tip i at time t. Under
certain biological conditions, cells behind the sprout tips undergo mitosis, and
sprout extension subsequently occurs. The movement of an individual sprout tip
during proliferation depends on the direction and speed of the sprout extension:
dpi (t)/dt = j kp,j (cj )u0,j (qj ), where kp,j , a function of CGF concentration cj ,
represents the cell proliferation rate and u0,j , a normalized vector specifying the
capillary outgrowth direction, is a function of the corresponding diﬀusive ﬂux.
We consider general functions kp,j (·) and u0,j (·) in this paper.
We denote by S the set of all active capillary tips. The behaviors of capillaries
are described by the movement of the tips, which includes sprout extension
and the changes of the tip set by branching and anastomosis. The tip set S
remains unchanged during capillary extension, but it is modiﬁed at branching
or anastomosis because these events change the number of elements in S.
In capillary branching, we terminate the parent capillary tip label and start
two new labels for the two resultant daughter tips. We denote the branching trigger function by fBT (τ, c1 , c2 , · · · , cNCGF ) and assume that the sprout branches
as soon as fBT (τ, c1 , c2 , · · · , cNCGF ) ≥ 0, where τ is the age of the capillary tip
and ci = ci (p, t) is the CGF concentration at the location occupied by the capillary tip. For example, fBT (τ, c1 , c2 , · · · , cNCGF ) = τ − τa speciﬁes uniform sprout
branching, where every sprout performs branching after maturing for the length
of time τa . Mathematically, sprout branching increases the number of elements
in the tip set S and is denoted by S(t+ ) = B (S(t− )) .
Anastomosis, the fusion of capillary sprouts, is assumed to occur when a
sprout tip meets another sprout tip physically (tip-to-tip anastomosis) or a
sprout tip joins another sprout physically (tip-to-sprout anastomosis). After a
tip-to-sprout anastomosis, the tip cell forms a part of the loop and no longer undergoes sprout extension, i.e. the tip no longer exists. We distinguish two types

98

S. Sun et al.

of tip-to-tip anastomosis: in a “head-on-head” anastomosis, both tips become
inactive, whereas in a “shoulder-on-shoulder” anastomosis, only one of the two
tips becomes inactive. Mathematically, the anastomosis mechanism decreases
the number of elements in the tip set S and is written as S(t+ ) = A (S(t− )) .
2.3

Bridging Cellular and Tissue Scales

The CGF concentration proﬁle strongly inﬂuences sprout extension, branching
and anastomosis, all of which control the development of a capillary network.
The capillary network, in turn, aﬀects the bioreaction and diﬀusion of CGF.
The capillary indicator function n is determined by the history of sprout tip
positions. We deﬁne the set NC (t) occupied by the capillary network at time
t as NC (t) = i τ ≤t BrEC (pi (τ )), where BrEC (x) = {ˆ
x : |ˆ
x − x| ≤ rEC }.
The radius of an endothelial cell rEC is assumed to be constant. The capillary
indicator function may be written as n = χNC , where χE is the standard set
characteristic function, i.e. χE (x) = 1 for x ∈ E and χE (x) = 0 otherwise.
2.4

A Modiﬁed Model Based on Cell Level Averaging

With initial and boundary conditions, the previous equations in this section
represent a mathematical system for two-scale modeling of angiogenesis. In this
paper, we analyze a modiﬁed system, which is based on cell level averaging:
∂c
= −∇ · (q) + α(1 − n) − λnc − λ∗ c,
∂t
q = −D∇c,
dpi
= MS (kp (c)u0 (q)) ,
∀i ∈ S,
dt
n = MS (χNC ({pi : i ∈ S})) ,
+
S(t ) = A BM S(t− ) .

(5)

We only consider a single CGF species here for simplicity of presentation, though
the analysis of multiple CGF species is a straightforward extension. The averaging operator (or the molliﬁer) MS is deﬁned for f ∈ L1 (0, T ; L1 (Ω)) by
x, t)dˆ
x/meas(BrEC (x)∩Ω), where meas(·) denotes
MS (f )(x, t) = Br (x)∩Ω f (ˆ
EC
the Lebesgue measure. The stabilized branching operator BM is formed from the
original branching operator B by replacing c by MS c in fBT (τ, c). We note that
MS may be viewed as a modiﬁcation operator to reﬂect averaged information
collected by a tip cell.
We consider the boundary condition q = 0 on ∂Ω and the initial condition c =
c0 at t = 0 for the CGF concentration. We impose the following initial conditions
for capillary tips: S = S0 and pi = pi,0 at t = 0. We note that, by using
algebraic equations, anastomosis and branching are described as instantaneous
events, whereas sprout extension is modeled as a continuous-in-time process
using ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs). Since the number of elements in
the set S changes with time, the number of unknowns in the system varies with
time.

A Two-Grid Algorithm

A mixed ﬁnite element (MFE) method is employed to approximate the CGF
diﬀusion-reaction equation on a concentration grid. We trace the trajectory of
each capillary tip using a standard ODE solver. A point-to-point tracking method
is proposed to simulate sprout branching and anastomosis, where algebraic conditions are applied for branching, and geometric conditions are checked for anastomosis. While the concentration grid is a mesh at the tissue scale, the capillary
network forms a secondary grid at the cellular scale. Locally conservative L2
projections are used for data transfer between the two grids when needed.
Let (·, ·)D denote the L2 (D) inner product over a domain D ⊂ Rd for scalar
d
functions or the L2 (D) inner product for vector functions, and, when D = Ω,
we drop the subscript. Let · Lp (D) , 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, be the Lp (D) norm for a scalar
d

function or the (Lp (D)) norm for a vector function. Similarly, let ·
s

d

be the standard H (D) norm or the (H (D)) norm. Throughout this paper,
we denote by C a generic positive constant that is independent of h and by
a ﬁxed positive constant that may be chosen to be arbitrarily small. We deﬁne the following standard spaces: (1) W = L2 (Ω); (2) V = H(div; Ω) =
v ∈ (L2 (Ω))d : ∇ · v ∈ L2 (Ω) ; (3) V0 = {v ∈ H(div; Ω) : v · ν = 0 on ∂Ω},
where ν denotes the outward unit normal vector on ∂Ω. The weak formulation
of the CGF diﬀusion-reaction equation is to ﬁnd c ∈ W and q ∈ V0 such that
c(x, 0) = c0 (x) and ∀w ∈ W , ∀v ∈ V0 , ∀t ∈ (0, T ]:

(6)
(7)

We let Eh = {Ei } denote a partition of Ω into elements Ei (for example, triangles or parallelograms if d = 2) whose diameters are less than or equal to h. Let
(Wh , Vh ) ⊂ (W, V) be a mixed ﬁnite element space of order r that possesses an
associated projection operator Πh : V → Vh satisfying: (1) ∇ · Vh = Wh ;
(2) (∇ · Πh q, w) = (∇ · q, w) , ∀q ∈ V, ∀w ∈ Wh ; (3) Πh q − q L2 (Ω) ≤
C q H s (Ω) hmin(r+1,s) ; (4) Ph c − c L2 (Ω) ≤ C c H s (Ω) hmin(r+1,s) , where Ph
is the L2 projection from W onto Wh : (Ph c, w) = (c, w) , ∀c ∈ W, ∀w ∈ Wh .
Obviously, we have ∇ · Πh q = Ph ∇ · q, ∀q ∈ V. The continuous-in-time mixed
ﬁnite element method for approximating the CGF diﬀusion-reaction equation is
to ﬁnd ch (t) ∈ Wh and qh (t) ∈ Vh0 = V0 ∩ Vh such that ∀w ∈ Wh , ∀v ∈ Vh0 ,
∀t ∈ (0, T ]:

We denote by ch , qh , ph and nh the ﬁnite element solutions for the CGF concentration, the CGF diﬀusive ﬂux, the capillary tip positions and the capillary

(Ω)), ∂c/∂t ∈ L2 (0, T ; H s (Ω)) and q ∈ (H s (Ω)) . We further assume that the
diﬀusivity tensor D is uniformly symmetric positive deﬁnite and bounded from
above, that c is essentially bounded, that parameters λ and λ∗ are nonnegative,
and that parameters α and λ are bounded. Then, for any given > 0, there exists
a constant C independent of the mesh size h such that

Ec = ch −c, the projection error EcI = cI −c, and the auxiliary error EcA = ch −cI .
Similarly, Eq = qh − q, EqI = qI − q, EqA = qh − qI . We also deﬁne En = nh − n.
Subtracting (6) and (7) from (8) and (9) respectively, splitting Ec and Eq
according to Ec = EcI + EcA and Eq = EqI + EqA , and choosing w = EcA and
v = EqA , we observe

Noting that the ﬁnite element solution at t = 0 is an L2 projection, i.e.
ch (0) = Ph c0 , we have EcA (0) = 0. We ﬁrst integrate (15) with respect to the
time t, and apply Gronwall’s inequality. Then recalling the triangle inequality
and the approximation results of projection operators Πh and Ph , we establish
the theorem.
We now estimate the error on capillary networks. Denote by J = (t0 , tF ]
the capillary tip life time period, where the ﬁnal time of the capillary tip tF is
the time when the tip becomes inactive due to either branching or anastomosis,
or is the ﬁnal simulation time T , whichever is shorter. Due to page limitation,
we list Lemmas 1–4 below without detailed proofs. Applications of the triangle
inequality and Gronwall’s inequality give the error bound on capillary extension
(Lemma 1). Exploration of the sprout branching stability condition leads to
its error estimate (Lemma 2). Geometric analysis results in the error bound
on anastomosis (Lemma 3). A straightforward manipulation of the set of the
capillary network establishes an L∞ upper bound on the error of the capillary
indicator function (Lemma 4). Based on the four lemmas, the approximations
of overall capillary behaviors are concluded in Theorem 2. The error estimate
for the coupled system is ﬁnally obtained in Theorem 3 as a consequence of
individual error bounds on the CGF concentration and capillary behaviors.
Lemma 1. (Capillary extension) We assume that c is bounded, that kp (c)
is a Lipschitz continuous function of c, and that u0 (q) is a Lipschitz continuous function of q. Then, there exists a constant C independent of the mesh size h
such that ph − p L∞ (J) ≤ C |p0,h − p0 |+C |t0,h − t0 |+C qh − q L1 (0,T ;L1 (Ω)) +
C ch − c L1 (0,T ;L1 (Ω)) , where p is the position of an individual capillary tip, p0
and t0 are the initial position and initial time when the tip is formed, and ph ,
p0,h and t0,h are their approximate solutions respectively.
Lemma 2. (Sprout branching) We assume that the branching trigger function fBT (τ, c) is a uniformly Lipschitz function of c with a Lipschitz constant CL ,
and there is a positive constant such that ∂fBT /∂τ ≥ C0 > 0. We further assume
that ∂c/∂t ∈ L∞ (0, T ; L1 (Ω)), ∇c ∈ L∞ (0, T ; L1 (Ω)) and dp/dt ∈ L∞ (J). If
CL /C0 is suﬃciently small, there exists a constant C independent of the mesh
size h such that |tB,h − tB | + |pB,h − pB | ≤ C |t0,h − t0 | + C ph − p L∞ (J) +
C ch − c L∞ (0,T ;L1 (Ω)) , where tB and t0 are the sprout branching time and the
tip birth time of the capillary under consideration, and tB,h and t0,h are their
approximate solutions respectively.
Lemma 3. (Anastomosis) We assume that the intersecting angle θA of the
two parent capillaries i and j at the location of anastomosis satisﬁes C0 ≤
|sin θA | ≤ 1 − C0 , where 0 < C0 < 1/2 is a ﬁxed small constant. We further assume that there exists a constant C1 such that |dp/dt| ≥ C1 > 0 in the neighborhoods of the anastomosis location. In addition, we assume that dpi /dt and dpj /dt
are bounded. Then there exists a constant C independent of the mesh size h
such that |tA,h − tA |+|pA,h − pA | ≤ C pi,h − pi L∞ (Ji ) +C pj,h − pj L∞ (Jj ) ,
where tA is the time of anastomosis, and pA the location of anastomosis.

Lemma 4. (Capillary indicator function) We assume that the exact total
capillary length is bounded. Then there exists a constant C independent of the
mesh size h such that nh − n L∞ (0,T ;L∞ (Ω)) ≤ C i pi,h − pi L∞ (Ji ) .
Theorem 2. (Capillary behavior) Let the assumptions in Lemmas 1–4 hold.
In addition, we assume that the number of capillaries from the exact solution is
bounded. Then there exists a constant C independent of the mesh size h such
that
nh − n

Proof. Combining Lemmas 1, 2 and 3, using the assumption on the boundedness
of the capillary number, and noting that a L1 (0, T ; L1 (Ω)) norm of a function
is no greater than its L∞ (0, T ; L1 (Ω)) norm, we obtain i pi,h − pi L∞ (Ji ) ≤
C qh − q L1 (0,T ;L1 (Ω)) +C ch − c L∞ (0,T ;L1 (Ω)) . The theorem follows from this
inequality and Lemma 4.
Theorem 3. (Final result on overall error bound) Let the assumptions
in Theorems 1 and 2 hold. Then there exists a constant C independent of the
mesh size h such that

Proof. Recalling that the constant in (11) may be chosen to be arbitrarily
small, we let = 1/(2C), where C is the constant in (16). Observe that the
L2 (0, T ; L2 (Ω)), L1 (0, T ; L1 (Ω)), and L∞ (0, T ; L1 (Ω)) norms of a function are
less than or equal to its L∞ (0, T ; L∞ (Ω)), L2 (0, T ; L2 (Ω)) and L∞ (0, T ; L2 (Ω))
norms, respectively. The overall error bound follows from Theorems 1 and 2.

We now present a numerical example simulating tumor-induced angiogenesis (illustrated in Fig. 1). All modeling parameters are taken from [4] except that the tumor colony is represented by a large CGF release rate: α =
6.42 × 10−18 mol/m2 s in the tumor area and α = 6.42 × 10−21 mol/m2 s in the
remaining extracellular matrix (ECM). The CGF is released from both the ECM
and the tumor cells, but substantially more so from the latter. Clearly, endothelial cells at the capillary sprout tips are migrating from the parent vessel to
the right, toward the tumor colony, as induced by the CGF concentration gradient. The simulation produces capillary networks with realistic structures and
morphologies. Readers are referred to [4, 5, 6] for more simulation results.

Conclusions

We have presented a deterministic two-scale model to simulate angiogenesis,
where CGF bioreaction and diﬀusion at a tissue scale are coupled with capillary
extension, branching and anastomosis at a cellular scale. To solve the coupled
angiogenesis system, we have proposed a two-grid numerical algorithm based on
MFE on a coarse mesh and a point-to-point tracking method on a ﬁne grid.
Optimal order error estimates have been derived for the proposed scheme. The
model generates an overall dendritic structure of the capillary network morphologically similar to those observed in vivo, and captures signiﬁcant vascular
patterning, such as vascular loops and backward growth. Clearly, experimental
work is needed to enhance and verify the model.
