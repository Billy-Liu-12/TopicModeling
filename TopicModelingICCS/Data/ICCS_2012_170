Abstract

A regression model based on Support Vector Machine is used in constructing Financial Conditions Index (FCI) to explore the
link between composite index of financial indicators and future inflation. Compared with the traditional econometric method, our
model takes the advantage of the machine learning method to give a more accurate forecast of future CPI in small dataset. In
addition, we add more financial indicators including M2 growth rate, growth rate of housing sales and lag CPI in our model
which is more in line with economy. A monthly data of Chinese CPI and other financial indicators are adopted to construct FCI
(SVRs) with different lag terms. The experiment result shows that FCI (SVRs) performs better than VAR impulse response
analysis. As a result, our model based on support vector regression in construction of FCI is appropriate.
Keywords: Financial conditions index, CPI inflation, data mining, support vector regression, financial time series predicting

Introduction

Deriving from the study of MCI (monetary conditions index), research about financial conditions index (FCI) has received
extensive attention in last ten years. The aim of FCI is supposed to describe the overall financial conditions, and it is a useful
indicator for the formulation of monetary policy.
However econometric research of FCI calculation methods relies on some strong assumptions like linear relationship
between inputs variables and output variables. Actually the relationship of interest rates, exchange rates, fluctuations of asset
prices and economic indicators, such as future inflation is not simply linear. Sophisticated financial systems researchers (Jan
Hatzius et al. 2010) [1] believed that the transmission channels were diverse and changed over time. Consequently, FCI
calculated by econometric method certainly ignores some real economic information.
Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm developed by Vapnik (2000) [2] is based on statistical learning theory. It is a
theory of machine learning focus on small sample data based on the structural risk minimization principle from machine learning
theory. The algorithm uses a nonlinear mapping from the original data space into some high dimension feature space, and then it
constructs a linear discriminate function to replace the nonlinear functions in the original data space. This special character
assures that SVM has good generalization ability and it has been widely used in many fields [3][4][5][6][7].SVM is a rather
robust tool for forecasting. It is promising methods for prediction of financial time series, Kyoung-jae Kam (2003) [8]. Trafalis et
al. (2004) [9] compared the forecasting stock prices of SVM for regression with Back propagation and RBF networks, and found
that SVM for regression is a robust technique for function approximation.
Besides solving classification problems, SVMs can also be applied to regression problems by introduction of an alternative
loss function, and the loss function must be modified to include a distance measure. Support vector regression (SVR) also can
add in the nuclear non-linear regression function which is econometric or other statistic methods lack, so SVR obtains good
application of predicting economic indicators and financial time series.
This paper proposes a new method to construct FCI by taking advantage of SVR to forecast CPI. After building the
predicting CPI model, we use the weight vectors of SVR model to calculate weights of FCI. In order to verify our method,
Chinese financial economic indicators and CPI data are adopted to construct FCI (SVR), and we will test our model in sample
and out of sample

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes 3 basic definition of FCI, SVR model and VAR impulse response
analysis which will be used. Then, our model based on SVR model is proposed to construct FCI (SVRs), and model test methods
are also discussed in the section 3. In the fourth section, the dataset of Chinese CPI and financial indicators is used to carry out
experiment, furthermore, in sample and out of sample tests are adopted to verify our model. At last, conclusion is in section 5.

Related models and basic definitions

In the early, based on the opinion that interest rate and exchange rate affecting the ultimate goal of monetary policy,
Freidman (1953)[10], Bank of Canada built a Monetary Conditions Index constructed by weighted average of short term rate and
exchange rate in order to measure the tightness of monetary policy in 1990s. David G Mayes et al. (2001) [11] explored how
asset prices, particularly house and stock prices, could provide useful indicators of future outputs and inflation changes. Goodhart
et al. (2001) [12] also implied that property and equity prices might also play an important role in the transmission of monetary
policy via wealth effect and balance sheet effect, so they extended MCI by adding real property and real share prices to obtain
the FCI, and the derived index appears to be a useful predictor of future CPI inflation. The idea was posed as follows.
Definition 1 Formulation of FCI
The definition of FCI is as follows, Goodhart et al (2000):

FCIt

wi (qit qit )

(1)

i

qit is the price of asset i in period t, qit is the long-run trend or equilibrium value of the price of asset i in period t, and

where

wi is the relative weight given to the price of asset i in the FCI. Obviously, the key step of building FCI is to select the
appropriate asset q and set w.
Definition 2 VAR impulse response analysis
The weights calculation method of FCI is mainly classified into three types: Large-scale macroeconomic model, IS-Curvebased model and impulse response equation based on VAR. Large-scale macroeconometric simulation is based on economic
theory to establish multi-equation model to simulate the overall economic process. But it requires a lot of economic data. As a
result, it is not available in all countries. Therefore, this method is seldom used. IS curve reflects the relationship between output
gap and interest rates, exchange rates, and other financial variables. The weights in the FCI are determined by the coefficients of
variable and their significant in the equation through regression analysis. Mayes et al. (2001) [11] ,Goodhart et al. (2001) [12]
used the IS curve to construct European countries FCIs. However, IS curve assumes that assets are exogenous, which is not in
line with economic realities.
VAR model assumes every variable in the system as endogenous, and lags all the variables used to construct function. Thus,
based on VAR model, impulse response analysis to calculate a unit change of every variable in the impact of inflation; finally,
according to the size of impact to determine the weight of the financial variables. Goodhart et al. (2001) [12], Céline Gauthier et
al. (2003) [13] evaluated G7 and Canada FCIs by using VAR impulse response functions. Dai et al. (2009) [14] constructed the
finance condition index based VECM and made use of FCI to forecast inflation in China. However, VAR or VECM model also
exists some limitation. One is that it needs to estimate many parameters so they cannot deal with small sample data. And the
other one is that time-series must meet the requirement of stable with same order.

Ai is an m m coefficient matrices, and we can use OLS to estimate (3).

Based on VAR model, an impulse response function measures the effect of shocks at a given point in time on the future
values of variables in a dynamical system. It is a appropriate description is to treat an impulse response as the outcome of a
T
conceptual experiment in which the effect of a hypothetical m 1 vector of shocks of size z ( z1 , , zm ) , hitting the
economy at time t is compared with a base-line profile at time t+n.
Definition 3 SVR model
In the SVMs, SVR (support vector regression) is used to solve regression problem. In order to set the algorithm, the loss
function must be modified to include a distance measure. There are some lost functions in the existing literatures such as the
insensitive , Steve R. Gunn (1998) [16]. Generally, SVR
conventional least squares error criterion, Laplacian, Huber and
chooses the

insensitive

loss function ( L ), Vapnik (2000) [17].

insensitive loss function means if the distance of f ( x) and y does not exceed , there is no loss between f ( x) and

objective function.
To illustrate the concept of SVR, a linear regression problem is formulated as follows. Consider a training data set
T {( x1, y1 ), ( xl , yl )} , where xi is the model inputs, yi is actual value and represents the corresponding output, and l is
total number of data patterns. The objective of the regression analysis is to determine the function, N Deng et al. (2009) [18]:

Financial Conditions Index based on SVR

In this section, we first discuss the financial indicators which will be added to our model. Then, based on the linear model
which is interpreted in section 2, we propose the non-linear model to predict CPI and calculation of the weights in sample and
out of sample model test method will be introduced at last.
Generally, most of FCIs included short-term interest rates, real effective exchange rate, real housing prices and the actual
stock price. Some FCIs also include a long-term interest rate or a corporate bond risk premium, such as Beaton et al. (2009) [19]
added real long-term interest rates and high-yield bond spreads to construct USA FCI. Michael Holz (2005) [20] used the credit
growth indicator, indicator of stock market misalignment to build the EMU FCI; Kimberly Jan Hatzius et al. (2010) [21] chose
assets include a broad range of quantitative and survey-based indicators besides interest rates and asset prices.
This article also includes short-term interest rates, real effective exchange rate, real estate prices and stock prices like other
existing studies. Besides, Feng et al. (2006) [22] thought that the long-term monetary policy in China took money supply as the
intermediate goal and operating objectives. Hence monetary will affect output and inflation, and then monetary supply (M2)
should be included in the index FCI. In addition, we add lag of inflation target (CPI) to the model, hoping to use past inflation
information to predict future possible situation. Stock market capitalization which was used by Goldman Sachs [23] in its
periodic reports issued United States, Europe, China and other countries or regions of FCI is also added in this paper. Moreover,
different changes on regional house prices lead to smooth fluctuations in house prices index. Accordingly, we add growth rate of
real estate sales, and the index is more volatile. All the financial indicators are listed in table1.

(2) in the section 2, we have the definition of loss function:

After that, our objective of the regression analysis is to determine the function:

A non-linear mapping linear regression performed can be used to map the data into a high dimensional feature space, in the
same manner as the non-linear SVC approach, Steve R.Gun (1998) [16]. To solve nonlinear regression problem in SVR, the
inputs are nonlinearly mapped into a high dimensional feature space wherein they are linearly correlated with the output, CJ Lu
(2009)[24]. Consquenly, we build the objective function of the dual problem by replacing ( ( xi ) ( x j )) with kernel function

K ( x, x' ) . In our model, we select the RBF1 kernel to build the nonlinear regression function:

The formula of RBF: K ( X indicators,i , X indicators. j ) exp(

where

In order to study the impact of different lag term of financial indicators on future CPI, the lagged one period, lag three
periods and lag six periods financial indicators are established as FCI (SVR1), FCI (SVR2), FCI (SVR3) based on (1),
respectively.
In sample test
We first find out dynamic correlations of FCI (SVRs) with future inflation in sample to verify that FCI (SVRs) plays an
important role in predicting future inflation. CPI is set at a point in time, and we examine the next 10 periods of FCI (SVRs)
dynamic correlation with the period of the CPI. If the value is positive (values belongs to [-1,1]), indicating that the future of FCI
(SVRs) have dynamic correlation with CPI. Moreover, it also illustrates that FCI (SVRs) lead ahead of CPI.
Then, we introduce the Granger causality test to study the link between CPI and FCI (SVRs) refer to Craig Hiemstra (1994) [25].
Let F (CPI t I t 1 ) be the conditional probability distribution of CPI t , set I t 1 consisting of an LCPI length lagged vector of CPI t ,

does not hold, then knowledge of past FCI (SVRs) values helps to predict current and future CPI values, and FCI (SVRs) is said
to strictly Granger cause CPI.

Out of sample test by AR model
Based on previous research (Goodhart, 2001 [12]), generally using other methods to build FCI has no ideal result in out of
sample forecast. This paper takes Goodhart and Hofmann (2001) [12] method, we estimate AR (Autoregressive) model for
predicting CPI rate by lag CPI rate, and compared with joining FCI (SVRs) prediction performance.
We estimate the following formula respectively:

We will compare the regression results of (14) and (15) by means of R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
where the R-squared indicates the explanatory power of the CPI rate forecasting, the higher R-squared means the greater
explanatory power in predicting; RMSE2 can evaluate the degree of change data. That is to say, smaller the value is, better
accuracy the prediction model describes the experimental data.

Experimental results and comparison

The data of indicators are adjusted monthly. CPI and M2 are year on year, equalling to the removal of seasonal trends. The
variables in the final model include: CPI 3( year on year), M2 (year on year)4, RMB real effective exchange rate index5, CSI 300
index return6, 6months short-term lending rate of financial institutions7, real estate sales in the month up8, housing sales price
index9 and the Shanghai Stock exchange A-share market capitalization10. Since none of the above series show long-term stable
trend, the original data has good randomness. Variables are listed in table 1, and all the monthly data are from January 2006 to
December 2010.
To take advantage of the model proposed in the section 3, we use grid research method to select optimal parameters of C
and

by LIBSVM-2.9 software system. In according to (12), we obtain the FCI (SVRs) weights showing in the table 2.

is from January 2006 to June 2010). As we can see from Figure 1, the FCI (SVR2) is leading the trend of CPI about six months
around. FCI (SVR1) and FCI (SVR3) have the same leading terms with CPI. (See figure in the Appendix).

In sample test result
We first look at the result of dynamic correlations between FCI (SVRs) and CPI. Figure 2 shows the dynamic correlations of
the above three FCIs with future inflation (Dynamic correlation table in Annex) every month.
As the result, the correlations of FCI (SVRs) with future inflation are generally quite high, show quite a significant
correlation between dynamic with CPI. The maximum dynamic correlation coefficients of FCI (SVR1), FCI (SVR2) and FCI

In addition, we also have Granger causality test described in section3 for in-sample testing. According to the fact that FCI
(SVRs) leads 6 months than CPI in above figure 1, 6 lag terms is chosen for further regression. The result shows that the null of
no causality is rejected at the 1% level in all cases, so we can conclude that the lagged FCIs contain significant information of
future inflation, that is to say, FCI (SVRs) are strictly Granger cause CPI.

Out of sample test result
We apply Eviews5.0 software to estimate (14) and (15) to testing FCI (SVRs) in out of sample which is from July 2010 to
December 2010. According to regression results, we list R-squared and RMSE in Table 4 and Table 5. It is easy to see, to AR (1)
and AR (2), the R-squared added the FCI (SVRs) are larger than the only lag CPI rate model, while, RMSE is less than the only
lag CPI rate model. The results show that FCI (SVRs) added variable will effectively improve the accuracy of prediction.

Comparison with VAR
We evaluate FCI (VAR) by VAR impulse response model as previous research generally done to compare with FCI (SVRs).
Firstly, go through sequence stationary test because VAR impulse response model requires that all data are stationary with the
same order. ADF test results show that the indictors including CPI and RMB real effective exchange rate index at 10% ADF test
and PP test significance level cannot reject the null hypothesis, which means that they are non-stationary series. All the above
sequence of the ADF test and PP test reject the null hypothesis after respectively first-order differential (the test results see
Appendix), which means that there is no unit root, and we use first-order differential for all series to establish VAR model.
VAR model should select first-order lag as the optimal lag through lag order selection based on AIC (Akaike's Information
Criterion) and SC (Schwarz Criterion) criteria. While taking advantage of lag 1 data modeling, all modules of unit root within the
unit circle, indicating that the VAR model is stable, so the impulse response function can be calculated.
We choose 15 Periods impulse response (impulse response function results in Appendix) in this paper, after then use the

the average of rate impulse response when the unit Cholesky new innovation of variable i affects CPI inflation in the next 15
months. The weights are listed in table 5, and we can construct FCI (VAR) based on VAR impulse responses by using formula

As the same of out-sample test mentioned above, we estimate AR(1) model by adding financial conditions index based on the

The table reveals that the Financial Conditions Index based on the SVR model performs better than the FCI based on the VAR

In addition, when estimate VAR model, we need to consume many degree of freedom to obtain a number of parameters.
Because of building FCI index of small sample size in this paper, only 54 sample points. However, if select more than four time
lag, VAR models cannot be used. By contrast, SVR still makes a good simulation of economic operation process to capture
financial status information of a longer lag period in smaller sample data sets, (lag 6 in this paper).

Conclusion

This paper proposes a new application of data mining method to construct Financial Conditions Index for forecasting CPI.
We believe that the relationship between financial indicators and future CPI is more complex and non-linear, instead of linear
assumption in traditional econometric. Thus, we take advantage of support vector regression algorithm using a nonlinear
mapping from original financial data spaces into high dimension space, in which it constructs a linear regression function to
express relationship of financial indicators and CPI simply. Actually, support vector regression also performs good forecasting
using a small sample dataset. That is to say, support vector regression is a robust tool to predict CPI through using financial
indicators. So, we introduce SVR to build the CPI forecasting model and make use of weight vectors to calculate weight of FCI.

In the experiment part, we make use of CPI (year on year) as the indicator of inflation, and 8 financial indicators include
lagged CPI and indicators of monetary market, stock market and real estate market. We use Chinese real monthly data (from
January 2006 to December 2010) to build three SVR prediction models with different lag terms. In a result, the FC(SVRs) are all
leading CPI about six months around.
Furthermore, FCI (SVRs) have shown more stability comparing to traditional methods based VAR impulse response analysis.
That is to say, FCI (SVRs) are more accurate, whether in sample test or out of sample test. The comparing results verify that
using SVR method to construct FCI is effective. And it is worthy to apply SVR in course of financial composite index
construction.
Additionally, our FCI (SVRS) are made of three FCI (SVRs) which use data of lagged 1 period, lagged 3 periods and lagged
6 periods, respectively. Actually, it does not consider the time-varying weights for a single FCI (SVR). That is to say we assume
that the effect of variables on future inflation is not change with time, which does not meet the actual economic performance.
Instead, the weights of our FCI (SVRs) are changing over time, which indicates lagged financial indicators impact future CPI
with time-varying. Moreover, a new FCI (SVR) model which contains a time series has been posed by virtue of multiple-output
SVR. Actually, a time series variables are used to predict a time series target variables. As a result, we can get rid of the problem
which is mentioned above partly, in short, using the time-varying outputs instead of the time-varying weights. Such consideration
will be our continue research points.
In addition to this, according to Y Shi et al.(2011)[26], we will try to use multiple criteria programming method to construct
FCI, as an alternative. In this way, we can make a comparation on the effects of different optimization based data mining
methods in the course of our topic. Besides, as this paper does not focus on the indicators selection, some work can be carried on
in this topic. In this course, we can take advantage of knowledge management [27][28]. We believe an improvement will be
gotten in that case.
