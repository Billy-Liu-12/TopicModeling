Abstract. The aim of this work is to tune the lattice Boltzmann
BGK (LBGK) simulation parameters in order to achieve optimum
accuracy and performance for time dependent ﬂows. We present detailed
analysis of the accuracy and performance of LBGK in simulating
pulsatile Newtonian ﬂow in a straight rigid 3D tube. We compare the
obtained velocity proﬁles and shear stress to the analytic Womersley
solutions. A curved boundary condition is used for the walls and the
accuracy and performance are compared to that obtained by using the
bounce-back on the links. A technique to reduce compressibility errors during simulations based on reducing the Mach number is presented.

Introduction

Suitability and accuracy of the newly established lattice Boltzmann method in
simulating time dependent ﬂuid ﬂows is demonstrated in the literature [1,2,3].
It is shown that use of curved boundary conditions noticeably enhances the
accuracy as compared to using the simple bounce-back on the links [4,5].
The aim of this study is to end up with optimal simulation parameters for
a desired accuracy with minimum simulation time. Simulation parameters for
ﬁxed Reynolds and Womersley parameters are studied. The paper is organized
as follows: First, we brieﬂy review the LBGK model we are using and then, we
discuss the convergence behavior under diﬀerent simulation choices and set up
the optimal conditions for best performance.

Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook in 1954. [6] The LBGK scheme is based on two
steps; streaming to the neighboring nodes and colliding with local node populations which are represented by the probability fi of a particle moving with a
velocity ei per unit time step δt. Populations, which are assumed Maxwellians,
relax towards equilibrium during a collision process. The equilibrium distribution

is a low Mach number approximation to the expansion of the Maxwellian distribution. Here, wi is a weighting factor, v = δx/δt is the lattice speed, and δx

is the dimensionless relaxation time.In this article, we used the standard quasi
incompressible D3Q19 model which has three types of particles on each node;
a rest particle, six particles moving along x, y and z principal directions. The

Simulations

In all simulations the ﬂow rate in the tube is computed from a measured aortic
pressure at the entrance. Its Fourier terms, up to the 8th harmonic, are used
to set a suitable pressure gradient for obtaining an average Reynolds number
Re = UνD = 590 and a Womersley parameter α = R ων = 16, where R =
D/2 is the radius of the tube, ω = 2π/T is the angular frequency and T =
1/f is the period, with f being the number of heart beats per second. For
details see [3]. Pressure boundary conditions are used for the inlet and the outlet
boundaries and, for the walls, either the bounce-back on the links (BBL) or the
Bouzidi boundary condition (BBC) [5] is used. We have performed three diﬀerent
categories of simulations of systolic ﬂow in a 3D rigid tube benchmark and one
simulation for the aortic bifurcation. The ﬁrst set of simulations compares BBL
with BBC. The second set deals with error behavior and the third set investigates
the convergence behavior.[7]
3.1

Inﬂuence of the Wall Boundary Conditions

A wall boundary condition is needed to evaluate distributions coming from solid
boundaries, while inlet/outlet conditions are needed to drive the ﬂow. In this
work, we investigate the error behavior for a complete systolic cycle which contains at least 16 harmonic terms. Moreover, we compare the error behavior for

550

the two boundary conditions at a ﬁxed Mach number in order to know how
much gain we get from using a more accurate, rather sophisticated boundary
condition, such as the BBC, over the less accurate but simple BBL.
The diameter of the tube is represented by 74 lattice nodes and the tube length
is L = 148 lattice nodes. First, BBL is used to simulate systolic ﬂow in the
tube. The simulation parameters are set to yield the required Womersley and
Reynolds numbers which are kept ﬁxed to the values mentioned above. For this
simulation, T = 2000, pressure gradient G = 1.1 × 10−5 , τ = 0.55 and A is
amplitude of Furie series. Samples of obtained velocity proﬁles at diﬀerent times
of the systolic cycle are shown in Fig. 1(a) compared to the real part of the
analytical Womersley solutions [8]. The average Mach number is 0.05 for this
simulation. The relative error in velocity at each time step is deﬁned by
n
i=0

Ev =

|uth (xi ) − ulb (xi )|
n
i=1 |uth (xi )|

(3)

where uth (xi ) is the analytical solution for the axial velocity and ulb (xi ) is
the velocity obtained from the LBGK simulations. The bounce back on the
links yields a time-averaged error of 0.11 at a Mach number of 0.05 for this
speciﬁc simulation. The set of simulations is conducted for the same simulation
parameters but using the BBC boundary condition. The agreement with
analytical solutions enhances signiﬁcantly, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and the average
error reduces to approximately 0.03.

pulse. Changes in any of these parameters will result in changes in the space
and time resolutions of the grid, and accordingly, the Mach and the Knudsen
numbers. In LBGK simulations the error behavior is inﬂuenced by the Mach
number, M = cUs , and the Knudsen number ∼ (2τ − 1)/D which approximates
the mean free path in the lattice BGK method. The compressibility error of
lattice BGK is given by [9]

increases with increasing Reynolds and Mach numbers, since Re = M Dcs /ν and
goes to zero as τ = 1 where the method behaves the same as ﬁnite diﬀerence
methods. As a function of Womersley number, the compressibility error can be
written as

St
where St = Df /U is the Strouhal number. In our simulations, the dimensionless
hydrodynamic numbers (Re, α and St) and the Mach or Knudsen numbers are
all ﬁxed. This implies that the grid must be reﬁned. There are three diﬀerent
ways to do this;
1. ﬁxed M method: in which the the diameter D, the period T and the
viscosity ν are changed while keeping ﬁxed the Mach number.
2. ﬁxed τ method: by changing the diameter D, the period T and the Mach
number M while keeping ﬁxed the lattice viscosity ν.
3. ﬁxed D method : by keeping ﬁxed the diameter D while changing the
viscosity, period and the Mach number.

The eﬀects of these changes on the grid resolution are shown in Table 1, in
which we assume an n times change in one of the parameters and compute the
corresponding changes in the other parameters to return the ﬁxed Re and α.
The ﬁxed M method does not involve reduction of the Mach number, which is
a major contributer to the error when considering time dependent ﬂows and,
therefore, it is not attractive in this study.

Accuracy and Performance with the Fixed D Method. In all simulations, the system is initialized from rest and the simulation ends after 40-50
complete periods. The BBL, BBC1 (ﬁrst order Bouzidi) and BBC2 (second
order Bouzidi) are used separately for each parameter set to end up with 9 simulations. The simulations are performed on 8 nodes of a Beowulf cluster using
slice decomposition.

average error of about 0.07, still less than the BBL results at a 10 times lower Mach
number. The system is instable with the BBL at this Mach number

The mean time per iteration is 0.2 seconds. Samples of BBC1 obtained velocities and shear stress proﬁles during the systolic cycle are shown in Fig. 2 for
M = 0.5, compared to the analytical Womersley solutions.Although M is relatively high, the agreement with the analytical solution is still better than those
obtained by a 10 times smaller Mach number with BBL shown in Fig. 1(a). The
last three rows in Table 2 list the average error associated with the three wall
boundary conditions.

Accuracy and Performance with the Fixed τ Method. In order to reduce
simulation time, it is necessary to have a large time-step in a coarse grid at a high
Mach number.We use the ﬁxed τ method to perform a set of simulations in which
the period is set to the smallest possible value that leads to a stable solution on
the coarsest grid. Then the corresponding values for the pressure gradient and

the relaxation parameter are set to yield the desired Womersley and Reynolds
numbers. The convergence behavior is studied by grid reﬁnement in both δx
and δt , as explained in Table 1. The simulation parameters are listed in Table 3
together with obtained average errors associated with the three used boundary
conditions. As it is shown in Fig. 3, at least second order convergence behavior is
guaranteed with this method. Moreover, solutions with periods smaller than the
ﬁxed D method are stable and therefore the simulation time is less, but it scales
as n2 . The convergence behavior as a function of time for this method is shown in
Fig. 4, which shows the diﬀerence between the analytical and obtained velocity
proﬁles at diﬀerent simulation times. In this ﬁgure, the method converges to a
reasonable accuracy after 40 complete periods, similar to the ﬁxed D method,
but with a major computational gain, since the length of the period is smaller
(i.e. δt is larger). This ﬁgure also illustrates that the error is localized near to
the walls, where large gradients exist, and it does not enhance noticeably near
to the walls on the same grid. Table 4 lists the error dependence as a function
of simulation times for BBL, BBC1 and BBC2 boundary conditions for a tube
with D = 65 lattice nodes. In conclusion, this method is computationally more
feasible than the ﬁxed D method.

Convergence Behavior

Convergence to steady state of the lattice Boltzmann method is signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by two local processes; initialization and boundary conditions. In this
section, we focus on the inﬂuence of initial and boundary conditions on the
convergence behavior.

and the body force is reduced n3 times to return the same Reynolds and Womersley
parameters at Re = and α = 16

Convergence and Walls Boundary Conditions. For the walls, bouncebacks and curved boundaries can be recognized. The bounce back is a very
eﬃcient boundary condition since it only involves a single memory swapping
process for each relevant distribution on each node on the surface of the simulated
object. For all curved boundaries, the exact position of the walls is determined
at least once if the boundary is ﬁxed and needs to be computed dynamically for
moving boundaries. This is more costly than using the bounce back rule.[7]
Inlet and Outlet Conditions. For non-periodic geometry, inlets and outlets
need to be treated diﬀerently in the following manner:
– Velocity and pressure : assign one and compute the other [10], assign both
(only for inlets) extrapolate or no ﬂux normal to the walls (only for outlets).
– Unknown distributions: compute explicitly [10], set to their equilibrium, copy
from nearest neighbors, interpolate or extrapolate.
For the ﬁrst item at least 15 additions and two multiplications are needed per
node on the boundary and therefore is at least 15 times more expensive than
periodic boundary conditions. A reasonable choice is then to assign pressure
and compute velocity at the inlet, no-ﬂux at the outlets and set the unknown
distributions to their equilibrium values. If the outlets are far enough from inﬂow,
copying from upstream would be the most eﬃcient outlet condition.

Conclusions

We have shown that the lattice Boltzmann BGK method is an accurate and
eﬃcient method as a solver for time-dependent ﬂows. Diﬀerent methods for
performing time dependent ﬂows at ﬁxed simulation parameters are tested
in terms of accuracy and performance. An aortic pressure is used as an inlet
condition to drive the ﬂow in a 3d rigid tube and the Womersley solution is
recovered to an acceptable accuracy. The inﬂuence of walls, inlet and outlet
boundary conditions on accuracy and performance is studied in details as a
function of Mach and Knudsen numbers.
