Abstract. We compare the predication performance of neural networks with the
different frequencies of input data, namely daily data, weekly data, monthly
data. In the 1 day and 1 week ahead prediction of foreign exchange rates forecasting, the neural networks with the weekly input data performs better than the
random walk models. In the 1 month ahead prediction of foreign exchange rates
forecasting, only the special neural networks with weekly input data perform
better than the random walk models. Because the weekly data contain the appropriate fluctuation information of foreign exchange rates, it can balance the
noise of daily data and losing information of monthly data.

1 Introduction
Exchange rates are one of the most important economic indices in the international
monetary markets. Because of its complicated nonlinear behavior, many researchers
employ neural networks to forecast foreign exchange rates. Several design factors
significantly affect the prediction performance of neural networks [1]. Although foreign exchange rates are high-frequency financial time series, fluctuating every minute, the researchers seldom employ the hourly observations for forecasting. Because
there is too much noises in the observations of high-frequency, no body use the frequency that is higher than daily data. It is a common practice to predict the future
value daily ahead with daily data[2, 3], to predict the future value weekly ahead with
weekly data[4-6], to predict the future value monthly ahead with monthly data[7-10].
Hann and Steurer compare the prediction performances of neural network models
with linear monetary models in forecasting USD/DEM by using the monthly data and
weekly data. Out-of-sample results show that, for weekly data, neural networks are
much better than linear models and a random walk model. However, if monthly data
are used, neural networks do not show much improvement over linear models[11].
In fact, different frequencies of input data may affect the performances of neural
networks, due to the volatility of currency movements. However, few researchers
investigate the effect of different frequencies of input data. Our contribution of the

paper is to compare the prediction performance of the neural networks by using the
different frequencies of input data. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the experiment design. Section 3 discusses the experiment results. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4.

2 Experiment Design
We employ the three frequencies of data, namely daily data { y td }, weekly data
{ y tw }, monthly data { y tm }. The daily data is the closing price of every trading day.
The weekly data is compiled from the average of daily data in that week. The monthly
data is compiled from the average of daily data in that month.
2.1 Random Walk Models
The weak form of efficient market theory describes that prices always fully reflect the
available information, that is, a price is determined by the previous value in the time
series because all the relevant information is summarized in that previous value. An
extension of this theory is the random walk (RW) model. The random walk model
uses the actual value of current period to predict the future value of next period as
follows:

yˆ t +1 = y t

(1)

where yˆ t +1 is the predicted value of the next period; y t is the actual values of current
period.
Therefore, the predicted values of next day, week, month by RW model are computed in the following way:
yˆ td+1 = y td

(2)

yˆ tw+1 = y tw

(3)

yˆ tm+1 = ytm

(4)

2.2 Neural Network Models

In this study, we employ one of the widely used neural networks models, the threelayers back-propagation neural network (BPNN), for foreign exchange rates forecasting. The activation function used for all hidden nodes is the logistic function, while
the linear function is employed in the output node. The number of input nodes is a
very important factor in neural network analysis of a time series since it corresponds
to the number of past lagged observations related to future values. To avoid introducing a bias in results, we choose the number of input nodes as 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Because neural networks with one input nodes are too simple to capture the

Comparisons of the Different Frequencies of Input Data

519

complex relationships between input and output, and it is rarely seen in the literatures
that the number of input nodes is more than nine. Generally speaking, too many nodes
in the hidden layer produce a network that memorizes the input data and lacks the
ability to generalize. Parsimony is a principle for designing neural networks. Hence,
the number of hidden nodes is equal to the number of input nodes.
Because there is no daily data of economic indicators such exportation, importation, we employ univariate input for the neural networks. The inputs of neural network are the past, lagged observations of exchange rates; the output is the future
value. In some sense, the neural networks of univariate input are equivalent to a
nonlinear autoregressive mode as follows:
yˆ t +1 = F ( y t , y t −1 ,…, y t − K )

(5)

where yˆ t +1 is the output of the neural networks, namely the predicted value of the
next period; y t , y t −1 ,…, y t − K are the inputs for the neural networks, namely the
actual value at the period t , t − 1 ,…, t − K , respectively; function F is a nonlinear
function determined by the neural networks; K is the max lag period, which is determined by the number of input nodes. In the study, when the number of input nodes
is 3, 5, 7 and 9, K is 2, 4, 6, 8, respectively.
We employ daily data, weekly data, monthly data as inputs of the neural networks
to predict the future foreign exchange rates of the next day as follows:

yˆ td+1 = Fdd ( y td , y td−1 , …, y td− K )

(6)

yˆ td+1 = Fdw ( y tw , y tw−1 , …, y tw− K )

(7)

yˆ td+1 = Fdm ( ytm , y tm−1 , …, y tm− K )

(8)

where yˆ td+1 is the output of the neural networks, namely the predicted value of the next

day; function Fdd , Fdw , Fdm are the nonlinear functions determined by the neural
networks with the input of daily data, weekly data, monthly data, respectively.
We employ daily data, weekly data, monthly data as inputs of the neural networks
to predict the future foreign exchange rates of the next week as follows:

yˆ tw+1 = Fwd ( y td , y td−1 , …, y td− K )

(9)

yˆ tw+1 = Fww ( y tw , y tw−1 , …, y tw− K )

(10)

yˆ tw+1 = Fwm ( ytm , y tm−1 , …, y tm− K )

(11)

where yˆ tw+1 is the output of the neural networks, namely the predicted value of the next

week; function Fwd , Fww , Fwm are the nonlinear functions determined by the neural
networks with the input of daily data, weekly data, monthly data, respectively.

We employ daily data, weekly data, monthly data as inputs of the neural networks
to predict the future foreign exchange rate of the next month as follows:

yˆ tm+1 = Fmd ( y td , y td−1 , …, y td− K )

(12)

yˆ tm+1 = Fmw ( y tw , y tw−1 , …, y tw− K )

(13)

yˆ tm+1 = Fmm ( ytm , y tm−1 , …, y tm− K )

(14)

where yˆ tm+1 is the output of the neural networks, namely the predicted value of the next

month; function Fmd , Fmw , Fmm are the nonlinear functions determined by the neural
networks with the input of daily data, weekly data, monthly data, respectively.
2.3 Performance Measure

We employ root of mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the prediction performance of neural networks as follows:
RMSE =

2
∑ ( y t − yˆ t )
t

(15)

T

where y t is the actual value; yˆ t is the predicted value; T is the number of the predictions
2.4 Data Preparation

From Pacific Exchange Rate Service provided by Professor Werner Antweiler, University of British Columbia, Canada, we obtain 3291 daily observations, 678 weekly
data and 156 monthly data of U.S. dollar against the British Pound (GBP) and Japanese Yen (JPY) covering the period the period from Jan 1990 to Dec, 2002. First, we
produce the testing sets for each neural network models by selecting 60 patterns of the
latest periods from the three datasets, respectively. Then, we produce the appropriate
training sets for each neural networks model from the corresponding left data in the
three datasets by using the method in [12].

3 Experiments Results
Table 1 shows the prediction performances of the random walk models, which are used as
benchmarks of prediction performance of foreign exchange rates for the different
forecasting horizons. The prediction performance become worse as the forecasting
horizon becomes longer. This pattern is consistent with the assumption of random
walk model.
Table 2-5 show the 1 day ahead prediction performance of the neural networks
with 3, 5, 7, 9 input nodes, respectively. In the 1 day ahead prediction of foreign ex-

change rates, the neural networks with weekly input data perform better than the random walk models; the neural networks with daily, monthly input data perform worse
than the random walk models. Because the daily input data contain too much noise,
while the monthly input data lose too much fluctuation information of foreign exchange rates at the scale of day.
Table 6-9 show the 1 week ahead prediction performance of the neural networks
with 3, 5, 7, 9 input nodes, respectively. In the 1 week ahead prediction of foreign
exchange rates, the neural networks with weekly input data perform better than the
random walk models; the neural networks with daily, monthly input data perform
worse than the random walk models. Because the daily input data can not cover the
enough period which contains the behavior of foreign exchange rate at the scale of
week, while the monthly input data lose some fluctuation information of foreign exchange rates at the scale of week.
Table 10-13 show the 1 month ahead prediction performance of the neural networks with 3, 5, 7, 9 input nodes, respectively. In the 1 month ahead prediction of
foreign exchange rates, the neural networks with weekly input data perform little
better than the random walk models when the number of the input nodes is 5 and 7;
the other neural networks models perform worse than the random walk models. It
indicates that the neural networks models are not suitable for the long term forecasting when the foreign exchange rates fluctuate a lot

According to the above results, we may see that weekly data is the appropriate frequency which matches the scale of fluctuation behavior of foreign exchange rates
fluctuation behavior. Weekly data balance the noise of daily data and losing information of monthly data.

We notice that the networks with 5, 7 inputs nodes perform better than the networks with 3, 9 input nodes. Because the neural networks with 5, 7 input nodes are at
the appropriate level of complexity, which balances the over-fitting and under-fitting.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we investigate the effects of different frequencies of input data of foreign exchange rates forecasting with neural networks. The neural networks with the
weekly input data performs better than those neural networks with the input of daily
data and monthly data. Weekly data is the appropriate frequency which matches the
scale of fluctuation behavior of foreign exchange rates fluctuation behavior.
