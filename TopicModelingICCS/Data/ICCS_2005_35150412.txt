Abstract. The brood sorting behavior of ants like Leptothorax unifasciatus leads to patterns, where brood items are sorted in concentric
circles around the nest center. The underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood so far and brood tending simulations can help to explain
the occurrence of these patterns. We reexamine an existing cellular automata based model for ant brood tending. This model is then modiﬁed
and extended by including a carbon dioxide distribution in the nest, that
inﬂuences the ants movement behavior. Furthermore, the ants can deliver
food to the brood in our model. Results of simulation runs are presented
that can help to explain brood patterns that have been observed in natural ant colonies.

Introduction

Brood sorting and brood tending behavior in ants has inspired several novel
methods in computer science like clustering algorithms or multi robot systems
(e.g., [2]). The underlying mechanisms which lead to such complex behavior
are still under investigation. In [3] the pattern formation within Leptothorax
unifasciatus ant colonies was investigated in artiﬁcial nests. The youngest brood
items (eggs and microlarvae) are placed in the center, successively larger larvae
are arranged in concentric rings around the center. However, the largest and
oldest brood (pupae and prepupae) is placed in an intermediate area between
the peripheral larvae and the larvae of medium size. One suggestion why this
happens is that these patterns help to organize the brood care [3]. The most
valuable brood has to be fed ﬁrst and is therefore placed at the outside, the
pupae and prepupae may be placed in intermediate positions as they do not
need food but only grooming.
In the inspiring paper [7] a stochastic lattice gas model of ant brood tending
was formulated. The authors suggested, that a possible reason for the central
egg location is that brood care is more evenly distributed in that area. We reexamine this model, make modiﬁcations to avoid unwanted artifacts, and extend
it by taking a CO2 distribution in the nest into account that inﬂuences the
ants movement behavior. Moroever, we simulate the brood feeding behaviour
of the ants. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the chemical

and biological background which is needed in the models. The cellular automata
transition functions used in [7] and our modiﬁcations are presented in Section 3.
The model and the results from [7] are reexamined in Section 4. Experimental
results with our model are discussed in Section 5 and a conclusion is given in
Section 6.

Biological Background

Several studies have shown the inﬂuence of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) concentration
on the behavior of social insects (e.g., [6]). In [1] a diﬀusion model was introduced and spatial patterns of CO2 concentration were explored analytically and
numerically. A special role plays the concentration gradient, as it is qualitatively
independent of ﬂuctuations of the absolute concentration. Ants are likely to have
the ability to detect this gradient with their antenna and are able to infer regions of CO2 sources (e.g., nest center) and CO2 sinks (e.g., the nest entrance or
periphery). In [8] the ability to detect the direction of the colony center was used
to model worker sorting in ant colonies. This approach was based on a model in
[4] for bacteria moving along a chemical gradient.
Besides the knowledge of the nest center the ants in our model will also carry
food. Ants carrying food tend to move towards the nest center, ants without
food tend to move to the periphery of the nest. Each ant will drop the food with
a certain probability.

Transition Functions and Measures for Brood Care

This section describes the transition functions of the cellular automata models
which are investigated in this paper. For all models the two dimensional Moore
neighborhood N = {(−1, 1), . . . , (1, 1)} and a space R = {1, . . . , L} × {1, . . . , L}
is used. At any lattice site there can only be 0 or 1 ant. In all models we proceed
similar to the cellular automata model in [7]: Within one time step all ants move
asynchronously and in random order. If an ant wants to move onto a lattice
site, that is occupied by another ant, it will not move. The driving rate p is the
probability that ants occur on the boundary square, an ant which moves onto a
boundary lattice is deemed to have left the brood, and is removed. Note, that the
following description of the ants movement behavior could easily be transformed
into a stochastic transition function for a cellular automata.
3.1

Transition Functions for Modelling Ant Movement Behavior

Deterministic movement: The deterministic behavior of the ants as described in
[7] is based on the transition function used in [5]. An ant tries to move in a direction which takes it as far as possible from the other ants of the four neighboured
cells (north, south, west and east). Formally, let n be the preferred direction
of motion for an ant, which is determined as n = [Fx /F ]i + [Fy /F ]j where
Fx = a(r − i, t) − a(r + i, t), Fy = a(r − j, t) − a(r + j, t), and F =

Fx2 + Fy2 ,

414

i and j are the standard basis vectors in two dimensional space, operator [x]
means the nearest integer to x, a(r, t) is the number of ants located in cell r
at time t. In [7] the tendency of ants to move in direction to the nest center is
modelled by placing a ring of stationary ants around the actual space R, thus an
ant which occurs on a boundary square of R will be forced to move away from
the boundary (a similar strategy was used in [5]).
Probabilistic movement behavior: To incorporate stochastic elements to the ants
behavior the following strategy was suggested in [7]. Let n be the preferred
direction according to the deterministic behavior of the ant, and d(n∗ ) = |n∗ −n|
be a function that quantiﬁes the deviation from direction n ∈ N to a direction
n∗ ∈ N . The probability P n,β of moving to n∗ is calculated as
∗

P n,β (n∗ ) =

e−βd(n )
−βd(n∗ )
n∗ ∈N e

(1)

where β is a parameter that determines the degree of randomness of the movement direction of an ant. If β = 0 all directions are equally likely, if β → ∞
the probability distribution in Equation 1 approaches a delta function peaked
at n∗ = n, i.e., ants behave according to the deterministic movement.
Brood Care Measure: It is argued in [7] that brood tending is of less quality, if brood care is unevenly distributed. Therefore, let τ (r, t) be the amount
of brood care (i.e., how often an ant was located at cell r within the ﬁrst t
steps), let τ (t) = 1/L2 r∈R τ (r, t) be the mean tending time per brood item,
1/2

and σ(t) = 1/L2 r∈R (τ (r, t) − τ (t))2
be the standard deviation of brood
tending times. Then the relative ﬂuctuation amplitude of brood tending times,
σ ∗ (t) = σ(t)/τ (t) is a dimensionless measure of ﬂuctuations in the amount of
brood care. A value of σ ∗ (t) < 0.1 is considered as eﬃcient brood tending.
3.2

Transition Function for the Extended Model

In this subsection we will present our extended model for ant brood tending
which incorporates a CO2 distribution within the nest and the ability of ants
to deliver food. Two new parameters are σ for the standard deviation of the
two dimensional normal distribution, that is used for modelling the CO2 pattern
within the nest, and parameter f which is the probability that a food carrying
ant drops it.
Strict gradient movement: For modelling the movement of ants towards or away
from the nest center, we determine CO2 levels in the nest according to a two
dimensional normal distribution. The CO2 level in cell r = (x, y) is
gr =

y−c 2
x−c 2
1
1
· e− 2 (( σL ) +( σL ) )
2
2πσ

where c = (c, c) with c = L+1
2 is the center of the nest. An ant uses the gradient
of these CO2 levels to determine its movement. An ant that carries food is moving

Modelling Ant Brood Tending Behavior with Cellular Automata

415

towards the center of the nest, an ant without food is moving away from the
center. Therefore, we use I = {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (−1, 1)} for determining the
pheromone gradient sum Gr = i∈I |gr+i − gr−i |, and let Gmax = maxr∈R Gr
be the maximal gradient sum in the nest, which will be used for normalization
of the probabilistic behavior. Formally, the probability that an ant carrying food
located at cell r will move in direction n ∈ N is determined as follows:
⎧ |g −g |
r+n
r−n
⎪
if n = (0, 0) and gr+n > gr−n
⎨ Gmax
g
g
Pr (n) = 1 − m∈N \(0,0) Pr (m) if n = (0, 0)
⎪
⎩
0
otherwise
For an ant without food the same formula is used, but in the ﬁrst case gr+n >
gr−n has to be exchanged by gr+n < gr−n . Note, that the probability to move is
small (resp. large) in areas where the sum of gradients of the CO2 level is small
(resp. large).
Probabilistic movement behavior: To incorporate more randomness in the ants
behavior which move according to the strict gradient movement, we used two
methods. The ﬁrst method is according to [7]. In contrast to the incorporation
of randomness as given in Equation 1, there is no preferred direction n of an
ant (which is used to calculate the probabilities P n,β ). Instead a probability
vector Prg is used, that determines the probabilities that an ant located at cell r
moves to a certain neighbor cell when strict gradient movement behavior is used.
P n1 ,β (n2 ) is the probability that an ant with the preferred movement direction
n1 moves in direction n2 (see Equation 1). Then
Prg (n1 ) · P n1 ,β (n2 )

Pr (n) =

(2)

(n1 ,n2 )
n1 +n2 =n

determines the probability that an ant located at cell s moves to neighbor n.
Similar to Equation 1 each neighbor is equally likely for β = 0, and for β → ∞
we have Pr (n) = Prg (n), i.e., the ants behave according to the strict gradient
movement.
The second method to incorporate more randomness simply uses a linear
combination of the strict gradient movement behavior and a pure random behavior, i.e.
(3)
Pr (n) = (1 − λ)Prg (n) + λ(1/|N |)
where λ determines the degree of randomness (λ = 0 leads to a strict gradient
movement behavior, and for λ = 1 a movement to any neighbor is equally likely).
Brood Care Measure: As suggested in [7] we count the number of brood tending
times τ (r, t) of brood located at cell r within t steps. As in this model ants carry
food, we will also measure the number ζ(r, t) of feeding times, i.e. how often
food is dropped in cell r within t steps. For our investigations we will also use
the mean tending time per brood member in certain areas around the center
c = (c, c) of the nest. Therefore, we measure τR (t, k) = 1/|Rk | r∈Rk τ (r, t)

416

with Rk = {r ∈ R : k − 1 ≤ ||r − c|| ≤ k}, k ≥ 1. If for ||r − c|| the L2 norm is
used, this function is denoted by τ circ (t, k), if the L-inﬁnity norm is used, it is
denoted by τ square (t, k). We proceed similar for mean feeding times ζ(t, k).

Reexamination of a Brood Tending Model

In this section we reexamine the results presented [7]. Brood care σ ∗ was measured on a ﬁeld of size L = 40 for diﬀerent degrees of randomness (β ∈ {0,
0.1,0.5,1,3, 5, ∞}) and diﬀerent driving rates p ∈ {0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1}. The brood
care intensity values for the whole space and for the center of the brood (the
central 12 × 12 lattice) are given in Figure 1.
In our simulation we basically obtained the same results as presented in [7],
but we can not agree with their interpretation why the brood care is worse at
the periphery. We consider this mainly as an artifact of the model. To show this

we measured the brood care in every single cell (see in Figure 2). Suppose a β
value is used, that combines a random behavior with the deterministic behavior
(comp. Equation 1). As in the model of [7] there is a ring of stationary ants on
the boundary. The inﬂuence of the deterministic behavior of the ants will lead
to the eﬀect, that ants which occur on the boundary tend to move towards the
center. Therefore, the brood care in the ring of cells that abut on the boundary
will be bad. The brood care in the next ring of cells towards the center will be
better, this eﬀect continues until the random inﬂuence gets too large, and brood
care is more evenly distributed. The brood care after 20000 steps is shown for
β = ∞ in Figure 2, the brood care values τ square are also given. Obviously the
uneven brood care will lead to smaller σ ∗ values in the center of the nest.

Results for the Extended Model

In Figure 3 the tending behavior in the extended model is shown for p = 0.05,
f = 0.03, λ = 0.5 and σ = 0.5. This result is particularly interesting, as the used
parameter for the normal distribution of CO2 in the nest leads approximately
to the equilibrium distribution as given in [1] and can therefore be considered
as a realistic distribution. In Figure 3 three diﬀerent regions of brood tending
can be distinguished. This helps to explain why the brood is organized in concentric rings around the nest center. To examine the brood tending (resp. brood
feeding) behavior more exactly the average intensity of tending (resp. feeding)
in concentric circles and squares around the center was measured (see Figure 4).
Again, the diﬀerent regions can be observed.
Brood tending results for diﬀerent driving rates p ∈ {0.01, 0.03, 0.1} are
shown in Figure 5. The existence of diﬀerent brood tending areas is obviously
quite robust with respect to the driving rate. The inﬂuence of the degree of randomness in the ants behavior is much stronger, as can be seen in Figure 6. While
for λ = 0.9 (nearly random movements of the ants) the smallest brood tending
values are in the nest center, this is very diﬀerent for a value of λ = 0.7, where
three diﬀerent tending areas appear. For even smaller values of λ the tending in
the nest center becomes extremely large and does not model realistic ant tending
behavior (λ = 0.2 in our simulation).

Due to space limitation we can only present the following results. Hence,
results for other nest sizes or for the second strategy to combine strict gradient
movement with randomness have to be omitted. Similar to [1] we investigated the
brood tending behavior for situations with a diﬀerent distribution of CO2 . Such
distributions can occur when, e.g., only three sides of the nest are open, and the
other side is not a CO2 sink. This leads to a diﬀerent equilibrium distribution of
CO2 and inﬂuences the behavior of the ants. Figure 7 shows the brood feeding
and tending behavior for this case (up, left, and bottom) and a CO2 distribution,
where the largest concentration is not located in the center of the nest, but in

Conclusion

In this paper a cellular automata model for ant brood tending behavior that
uses a combination of deterministic and stochastic behavior was reexamined. We
have shown that uneven brood care is an artifact of the model. A modiﬁcation
of this model has been introduced where uneven brood tending patterns occurs
similar to those observed in real ant colonies. The model has also been extended
to include the carbon dioxide distribution that inﬂuences the ants movement
behavior and to model food delivering by the ants. Our results may help to
explain the existence of pattern formation in real ant nests.
