Abstract
In this work, an eﬃcient coupling between Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulation and Darcyscale ﬂow in porous media is presented. The cell centered ﬁnite diﬀerence method with nonuniform rectangular mesh were used to discretize the simulation domain and solve the governing
equations. To speed up the MC simulations, we implemented a recently developed scheme that
quickly generates MC Markov chains out of pre-computed ones, based on the reweighting and
reconstruction algorithm. This method astonishingly reduces the required computational times
by MC simulations from hours to seconds. To demonstrate the strength of the proposed coupling in terms of computational time eﬃciency and numerical accuracy in ﬂuid properties,
various numerical experiments covering diﬀerent compressible single-phase ﬂow scenarios were
conducted. The novelty in the introduced scheme is in allowing an eﬃcient coupling of the
molecular scale and the Darcy’s one in reservoir simulators. This leads to an accurate description of thermodynamic behavior of the simulated reservoir ﬂuids; consequently enhancing the
conﬁdence in the ﬂow predictions in porous media.

Introduction

It is crucial for reservoir ﬂow simulators to have eﬃcient thermodynamic models that accurately describe the phase behaviour of the subsurface ﬂuids. So far, continuum-based models
(e.g. equations of state and correlations) have played the major role in fulﬁlling the task [1, 2].
Nonetheless, with the increase in exploiting the non-conventional reservoirs, the continuumbased models have faced two main challenges [3, 4]: (i) Lack of experimental data availability

due to operating under extreme pressure and/or temperature conditions, in addition to presence
of hazardous materials (e.g. corrosive, toxic and explosive). (ii) Working at extremely small
scale (e.g. tight formations and shale gas reservoirs).
On the other hand, Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulation, which is based on statistical
thermodynamics principles [5–8], is capable of overcoming these challenges; however it imposes
a high computational cost. This computational burden has made it infeasible to replace correlations by MC molecular simulations in order to describe ﬂuid thermodynamic properties in
ﬂow simulators. Recently, we have proposed several techniques aiming to overcome this obstacle. In doing that, two strategies have been adapted. The ﬁrst strategy tries to accelerate MC
simulations by modifying the original algorithm itself [9] via proposing the conservative [10] and
the non-conservative [11] early rejection algorithms. The second strategy works by extracting
more information from the pre-generated MC Markov chains, such that a single simulation
can be used to replace multiple ones. For this purpose, the reweighting and reconstruction
method [12, 13] has been developed in addition to the NVT-NpT switching scheme [14].
In this article, a novel multi-scale coupling between Darcy-scale ﬂow and MC molecular simulation is presented. In all the investigated cases a compressible single-phase methane reservoir is
simulated under various isothermal production and geophysical scenarios. In distinctive manner from the classical approach, few pre-computed MC Markov chains were only used to feed
the ﬂow simulator with the necessary thermodynamic properties at wide range of pressures. It
is worth to mention that these thermodynamic properties (ﬂuid density and isothermal compressibility) are needed by the simulator at every discretized cell at every time step. For this
particular reason, it is infeasible to run a full independent MC molecular simulation, which may
need more than 30 minutes for each cell at every time step using an Intel 2.67 GHz processor. For instance, in this work an order of hundreds of discretized cells was used. Fortunately,
the reweighting and reconstruction method enables us to use and reuse few pre-computed MC
Markov chains to accurately predict ﬂuid properties at neighboring thermodynamic conditions
within fraction of a second.
In the following sections of the paper, a brief description about the reweighting and reconstruction method and its switching scheme is provided. Moreover, a complete set of ﬂow governing
equations are listed and discussed. Finally, the ﬂow simulation results for diﬀerent methane
reservoirs are presented.

Simulation Methods
Flow governing equations

The cell centered ﬁnite diﬀerence method for compressible single-phase single-component system was used. The system was reduced to a set of linear equations in which the pressure ﬁeld
was the primary unknown. Then using MATLAB’s linear solver, these equations were implicitly
solved employing a constant time step. Simulations with uniform and non-uniform rectangular
mesh were both considered. The governing equations that describe the system are:
The mass conservation law:
The mass conservation law equates the diﬀerence between the input and the output ﬂuxes

∂t

(1)

In Equation 1, φ is the rock porosity, ρ is the mass density, u is the darcy velocity , q is the
mass source and t is the time. Based on the deﬁnition of the isothermal compressibility, the
mass conservation law can be formulated in terms of pressure instead of density as follows:

where p is the pressure and CT is the isothermal compressibility.

Under the assumption of no gravitational ﬁeld eﬀect, the Darcy’s law takes the form in Equation 3; where, k and μ are the rock permeability and ﬂuid viscosity, respectively.
Production well model:
In describing ﬂow around wells, the well known Peaceman radial well model [15] was employed:
q = W I (pbh − pc ) ,
WI =

2πρ kx ky hz
.
μln( rrwe )

(5)

In the Peaceman model, WI is the well index, kx and ky are the permeabilities in the x and y
directions respectively, hz is the vertical thickness, pbh is the well bottom hole pressure, pc is
the cell average pressure, re is the cell equivalent radius and rw is the well radius.

In the equations above, μg is the viscosity in cp, ρ is the density in g/cm3 , p is the pressure in
psia, T is the temperature in R and M is the gas molecular weight.
Density:
The ﬂuid density was estimated using the pre-computed MC molecular simulation results,
solving the non-linear inverse problem for the known pressure using the NVT-NpT switching
scheme [14]. For each Markov chain an MC simulation of 216 LJ particles were simulated in
NVT ensemble for 10 × 106 and 20 × 106 steps corresponding to equilibrium and production,
respectively.
In MC molecular simulation, macroscopic properties are usually obtained by averaging conﬁgurational quantities. Tail corrections are preferentially considered to account for the domain
truncation errors. The ﬁrst direct macroscopic output of the NVT ensemble is often pressure.

Equation 11 represents a pre-deﬁned conﬁgurational property that is solely dependent on the
particles distances distribution in the simulated system. The model parameters ε and σ are
related to the nature of the simulated particle, N is the total number of particles, β ∗ is the

Whereas, V can stands for the canonical average of V over all the sampled conﬁgurations,
which is normally evaluated using Equation 10 with all the weights wk set to zero to obtain the
arithmetic average of the conﬁgurations. The pressure tail correction function p∗tail is used to
count for truncated interactions beyond the imposed cutoﬀ radius rc∗ .
Implementing the setup above, one can successfully evaluate p∗ for any given MC Markov
chain at a certain ρ∗ and β ∗ . Furthermore, the forward reweighting and reconstruction scheme
makes it possible to use a single Markov chain at a certain ρ∗ and β ∗ to predict pressures
at neighboring thermodynamic conditions (ρ∗ +Δρ∗ , β ∗ +Δβ ∗ ). Along Isotherms, the source

It is important to highlight that the above formulation is solving an NVT problem starting from
an MC Markov chain generated by an NVT ensemble simulation. However, within the ﬂow simulator environment, an NpT problem exists. For this particular reason, switching scheme was
originally developed [14].
Isothermal compressibility:
Once the unknown ﬂuid densities corresponding to the given pressures at each cell were evaluated, the ﬂuid isothermal compressibility was estimated via the forward reweighting and reconstruction method. The inverse of the normalized isothermal compressibility (CT∗−1 ) was
evaluated using the following formula [14]:

the reader is referred to [13]. Figure 1 summarizes the work ﬂow of combining the forward
reweighting and reconstruction with the switching scheme. First, the inverse problem discussed
earlier is solved to evaluate the ﬂuid densities out of a given pressure (Figure 1.a). After the
pressure is known, the isothermal compressibility can be directly evaluated via the forward
reweighting and reconstruction method (Figure 1.b).

= 368.5 K). These reservoirs have diﬀerent conﬁgurations with a 2D domain covering 240 m
× 240 m area of 0.2 porosity with Neumann no ﬂow boundary condition. In all the studied
scenarios, the production lasted for 200 days, while the initial reservoir pressure and the well
down-hole pressure were 200 and 100 atm, respectively. The proposed multi-scale coupling
algorithm between MC molecular simulation and Darcy ﬂow, used in simulating the studied
cases in this paper, is given in Figure 2.

3.1

Homogeneous reservoir test case

In the ﬁrst scenario, a homogeneous permeability ﬁeld of 100 md was imposed throughout the
reservoir domain which was discretized as 80 × 80 cells. A single production well was placed at
the center. Figure 3 shows the contour plot of pressure ﬁeld with the velocity streamlines and
the production rate proﬁle relative to initial production. As expected, the pressure and velocity
ﬁelds are symmetric around the wellbore because of the homogeneity of the domain properties.

3.2

Heterogeneous reservoir test case

In the second scenario, a heterogeneous permeability ﬁeld with values ranging from less than 1
md to about 200 md was imposed throughout the reservoir domain with a single production well
at the center with 50 × 50 cells discretized domain. The eﬀect of the heterogeneous medium
is clearly seen in the irregular shape of the streamlines and the pressure contour plot (Figure
4.b). In this case the production rate decline is slower than the homogeneous case (Figures 3.a
and 4.a) although the overall average rock permeability in the two cases is almost the same.
This is mainly because of the presence of dead zones in the heterogeneous reservoir that have
very low permeability and as a result, the reservoir is depleted at slower rates.
