Abstract
The development of new numerical methods is of great importance in computational science. Due to their many
appealing properties, Finite Element (FEMs), Finite Volume (FVMs) and Finite Diﬀerence (DFMs) methods are of
particular interest, with a very large number of journal articles devoted to them. Unfortunately, these methods can
be time consuming to implement when one would like to explore certain numerical properties or make comparisons
with other methods. In this paper, we propose a new computational environment in which the speciﬁcation and
implementation of such methods introduced in journal articles can be perpetuated and the experimentation with them
can be made reproducible and easily compared with related work.
Keywords: High-performance computing, Web-based review process, Numerical methods, Rapid prototyping

1. Introduction
Mathematical models based on diﬀerential equations constitute a large part of the modeling of natural phenomena.
Being intrinsically complex, analytical solutions to these equations are only available in very speciﬁc cases. As such,
approximate solutions must be obtained computationally using some type of numerical method. Researchers and
practitioners seek a method bearing in mind a certain set of desired characteristics, including:
• Flexibility. The method should be easily adapted to new computational situations, such as the resolution of a
model on varied and possibly complex domains.
• Accuracy. The solution to the method should be as near to the true solution as necessary.
• Performance. The use of parallelization is highly desirable when solving complex problems in reasonable
time, and numerical methods amenable to parallelization are of particular interest.
• Mathematical theory. This can aid in the theoretical understanding of the properties of the method.

Among the various families of numerical methods available, the most important methods fulﬁlling either completely
or partially the cited requirements for the solution of diﬀerential equations are Finite Element (FEMs), Finite Difference (FDMs), and Finite Volumes (FVMs) Methods. Originally conceived as tools to approximate solutions to
problems in solid mechanics, they are now widely used in diverse scientiﬁc ﬁelds, including ﬂuid ﬂow and transport problems, simulation of heat transfer, electromagnetic, environmental and biological phenomena. Consequently,
articles concerning the aforementioned numerical methods are ubiquitous in the scientiﬁc literature.
From a mathematical perspective, such numerical methods create a discrete formulation to search for an approximation to the true solution. This discretization is equivalent to a system of linear equations A u = b, which is readily
solvable using, e.g. LU decomposition. Unfortunately, the system matrix A resulting from more classical methods
may at times be nearly singular, resulting in stability issues. Alternatively, it is interesting to seek more eﬃcient
approaches to ﬁnding approximate solutions while maintaining accuracy in the method. This is why the deﬁnition
of new methods represents an important line of active research, resulting in a very large volume of papers. In this
context of a large volume of papers devoted to—or related to—numerical methods, the overall process of conception,
validation, review and publication of such papers is increasingly challenging. Before developing a new numerical
method, for instance, an author needs to be familiar with methods that already exist in order to understand the problems that must be addressed. The process of working through the existing bibliography can be very time-consuming,
particularly when the numerical results presented for a given method are not suﬃcient to fully understand its behavior
in interesting cases. In this situation, an author must implement the method to perform the desired tests, often with
signiﬁcant time-cost. A similar issue arises when a reviewer is assessing a manuscript that describes a proposal for a
new method. Figure 1 shows one example [1], among many others [2, 3, 4], of a published, mathematically elegant
FEM requiring a non-trivial implementation.

Figure 1: A mathematically elegant FEM requiring a non-trivial implementation.

The above discussion raises a fundamental question:
How can the publication process (from the point of view of both authors, reviewers, and editors) be
streamlined so that the numerical properties of a method may be understood without the time-sink of
(re)implementation ?
In an attempt to cover the expectations generated by the above question, we envision a very simple approach
to adapting the typical process for publication of papers in computational sciences or scientiﬁc computing journals.
The rationale behind our approach is that the speciﬁcation and implementation of numerical methods for solving

690

Antôonio T. A. Gomes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 688–696

diﬀerential equations should be perpetuated and the experimentation with such methods should be made reproducible
and easily compared with related work.
Our approach is based on a high-performance computing environment called SPiNMe (Scientiﬁc Productivity in
Numerical Methods). In the SPiNMe environment, numerical methods can be implemented and run over a set of
well-deﬁned input data, including meshes and initial/boundary conditions—optionally, additional/diverse input data
may be provided—, and have its output data, including accuracy and performance information, compared with other
implementations. Researchers can test their implementation within the SPiNMe environment, compare their results
with others previously published in the environment, and when considering such results worth publication, submit
the method implementation, the input data used and output data obtained, and the corresponding manuscript in the
environment for peer reviewing. The reviewers have access to all such information from a submission—hereafter
executable submission—and can provide their own input data, running the submitted method implementation against
such data and analyzing the corresponding output data if they ﬁnd it necessary. The executable submission being
accepted for publication, it can be made available to journal readers as an executable paper.
Up to our knowledge, the present work proposes an original way to approach the issue of streamlining the publication process in computational sciences or scientiﬁc computing journals. More speciﬁcally, the main contributions
of the work may be outlined as follows:
• Flexibility without lack of comparability. The SPiNMe environment allows the various features underlying numerical method deﬁnitions—domain discretizations, variational formulations, basis functions, numerical
integration processes, time-marching schemes, linear solvers, and so on—to be explored by method implementations. At the same time, the comparison of diﬀerent methods does not imply the creation of whole new
software packages for each new executable submission.
• Productivity. The SPiNMe environment provides a way for scientists to rapidly prototype their methods.
Rapid prototyping techniques enables a short time interval between the conception of a proposal and the actual
deployment of a functional product to serve as a proof-of-concept. This approach is of current practice in many
diﬀerent industries and ﬁnds place in the development of computing systems [5] as well. In particular, rapid
prototyping has been recently explored for parallel [6] and scientiﬁc programming [7].
• Long term compatibility. The SPiNMe environment only requires from researchers the use of a local web
browser (beside the typical tools used for typesetting manuscripts). Therefore, the publication process is much
less prone to problems related to changes in the users’ operating system and hardware architecture.
• Security. The SPiNMe environment oﬀers sandboxes for the controlled execution of method implementations.
Therefore, security threats such as defective or malicious code can only aﬀect its own execution.
To attain these contributions, we adopted a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) service model [8] for the proposed SPiNMe
environment. We abide by this model through three key design decisions for the SPiNMe environment. First, a single
set of numerical library implementations is provided to the researcher for the implementation of his/her numerical
method. As such, the diﬀerences between two method implementations are arguably due to diﬀerences between the
methods themselves only. Second, the provided numerical libraries can be parameterized either via input data or via
“plug-in” code representing the particularities of a speciﬁc numerical method—whether it be implementation of new
basis functions, variational formulations, or integration processes, etc. Finally, plug-in code is implemented in a highlevel language: therefore, researchers can focus more on prototyping their methods than on coding typical idioms
of lower-level languages such as C++ and Fortran (e.g. for memory management). Moreover, such plug-in code is
amenable to sandboxing by means of application-level virtualization, in which such code is only oﬀered a prescribed
set of mathematically-related capabilities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. The architecture of the
SPiNMe environment is presented in Section 3 and a prototype in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions and
future work.
2. Related work
To the best of our knowledge there is no project with the same intended contributions as the SPiNMe environment,
although a number of projects have inspired its design.

ModelDB [9] is a repository of computational neuroscience models. This repository provides a comprehensive
neuroscience dataset submitted by authors, including papers, model types and concepts, and simulation software.
Nevertheless, ModelDB does not provide an execution platform and lacks a well-deﬁned comparability basis for
related work.
PyCC [7] is a Python-driven numerical method library for solving diﬀerential equations with FEM. Flexibility and
eﬃciency are the two main design goals of PyCC, and are attained in a very similar way as the pieces of plug-in code in
the SPiNMe environment. Nonetheless, PyCC allows the use of symbolic expressions for typical geometric elements,
polynomial basis functions, and variational formulations, making it fairly easy for using FEM but not necessarily
deﬁning new methods based on FEM. Besides that, in contrast with our approach, PyCC provides a software package,
not a service environment.
SHARE [10] is the project that bears most resemblance with SPiNMe. Crucially, both projects employ virtualization for running academic software, albeit at diﬀerent virtualization levels. SHARE is a cloud computing environment
that enables academic researchers to demonstrate and evaluate research software. Management of research software
in the SHARE environment is attained by cloning and customizing “standard” system-level virtual machine images
to host such type of software; this characteristic contrasts with the application-level virtualization employed in the
SPiNMe environment. A customized image in the SHARE environment can be associated with related documentation
(e.g. papers) and published to a group of users in the environment, which can then run the software hosted in an
instantiation of such an image. Overall, the SHARE environment arguably has a broader applicability than SPiNMe,
but with the cost of a poorer basis for comparability with related work.
3. SPiNMe architecture
In the following, we present the design of the SPiNMe environment. We use two diﬀerent architectural views for
such presentation: use cases view and deployment view.
3.1. Use Cases View
Researchers may interact with the SPiNMe environment through a web interface at three diﬀerent privilege levels
(see Figure 2). The ﬁrst level is the Reader (a common user of the environment), who can run the various implemented methods. One example of a Reader would be a journal reviewer when evaluating an executable submission.
The second level is the Author-Developer, who will often be a researcher interested in publishing the implementation
of a method. The Author-Developer may test his/her implementation in the SPiNMe environment and later include
it in his/her personal account in the environment. When the Author-Developer believes his/her method is ready for
evaluation, he/she may submit the method to the Moderator (the third privilege level in the SPiNMe environment),
who must approve or reject it. One example of a Moderator would be the editor-in-chief of a journal. Such approval/rejection can be done either by the Moderator alone or with the help of other Readers acting as reviewers.
Upon acceptance, the method is made publicly available in the environment as an executable paper.
3.2. Deployment view
The SPiNMe environment comprises of three main component sets, as shown in Figure 3. The Web Server hosts
the software components with which the users interact via web browsers. A Cluster (or set thereof) handles computational aspects of numerical method implementations, as well as auxiliary tools such as visualizers. A Database
Server hosts a database management system, where the executable submissions are stored. The fact that the numerical method implementations run on clusters and all the test and submission process are handled through web-based
interfaces and stored in a database makes the executable submissions very likely be perpetuated.
The portion of the SPiNMe environment concerning the Web Server component set is straightforward to implement.
The portion of the SPiNMe environment concerning the Cluster component set makes use of well-known libraries
such as BLAS [11] for numerical linear algebra and VTK [12] for visualization. As for the numerical method implementations, we need a library suﬃciently ﬂexible to allow for the experimentation on the various features of method
deﬁnitions—basis functions, variational formulations, and so on. A preliminary analysis of some publicly available

numerical method libraries points out that there is no existing library to date with the ﬂexibility we demand. Therefore, we are working on the adaptation of an existing library—the NeoPZ library1 —to the needs of the SPiNMe
environment. Our ﬁrst eﬀorts on the adaptation of the NeoPZ library have focused on FEM. Such adaptation relies
upon embedding a high-level language interpreter into the NeoPZ library, which researchers may use to more rapidly
prototype FEM deﬁnitions through the parametrization of NeoPZ by means of plug-in code.

4. Method prototyping
Method prototyping in the SPiNMe environment is based on the Lua scripting language [13]. We have chosen
Lua to prototype method implementations due to its simple and extensible syntax, high abstraction level, and good
performance in general. The Lua interpreter gives to the pieces of plug-in code access to method building blocks
through a high-level API. To date, we have implemented method building blocks that allow an Author-Developer to
express the variational formulation of several types of diﬀerential equations in the SPiNMe environment. The other
features of numerical methods will be the subject of forthcoming work (see Section 5).
4.1. The FEM case
To better illustrate how the method building blocks for expressing variational formulations can be used in the
SPiNMe environment, we provide herein a quick overview of FEM.
We start by deﬁning the typical problem FEMs try to solve: ﬁnd a function u(x) that satisﬁes the following partial
diﬀerential equation
Au(x) = f (x), ∀x ∈ Ω ,
u(x) = g(x), ∀x ∈ ∂Ω ,

(1)

where A stands for a diﬀerential operator, f (x) and g(x) are given data, and Ω is a domain with boundary ∂Ω. The
exact solution to Equation (1) is not available in general, so we must approximate. This is the role played by FEM.
Roughly speaking, methods of this type need a discretization of Ω called mesh. Such a mesh is built on geometric
elements such as triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, or hexahedra, for example. Figure 4 depicts an example of a
typical mesh.

Figure 4: Example of mesh discretization of a complex domain (Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) [14].

The ﬁrst step toward the approximate solution consists of writing Equation (1) in the so-called variational formulation (or weak form), which is deﬁned over an inﬁnite dimensional function space V:

Ω

Au(x) v(x) dΩ =

Ω

f (x) v(x) dΩ

∀v(x) ∈ V.

Next, the variational formulation is restricted to an N-dimensional function space Vh . The goal is to produce a discrete
function uh (x) ∈ Vh , which is ”close enough” to exact solution u(x) (see [15] for details), and solves

Ω

Auh (x) vh (x) dΩ =

Ω

f (x) vh (x) dΩ

∀vh (x) ∈ Vh .

(2)

694

Antôonio T. A. Gomes et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 688–696

Letting {φ1 , . . . , φN } be a basis of Vh , the solution to Equation (2) may be expressed as a linear combination of φ j
N

uh (x) =

u j φ j (x) ,

(3)

j=1

where ui ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , N. Substituting (3) in (2) and then selecting vh = φi , for i = 1, . . . , N, it holds that
u = {ui }i=1,...,N can be computed from the algebraic linear system A u = b. Here matrix A and vector b are associated
to the left and right hand-side terms in (2), respectively.
As an example of the procedure previously described, let us select A ≡ −Δ and g(x) ≡ 0 in Equation (1). This
corresponds to the heat conduction problem: Find u(x) such that
−Δu(x) = f (x) in Ω
u(x) = 0 on ∂Ω ,
where Δu(x) =

∂2 u
(x)
∂x12

For this particular case, the discrete variational formulation (2) reads

Ω

∇φ j (x) · ∇φi (x) dΩ =

Ω

f (x) φi (x) dΩ , ∀i = 1, . . . , N ,

(5)

where we recall ∇φi (x) := ( ∂φ∂xi (x)
, ∂φ∂xi (x)
) (for a bidimensional domain). We notice the equation above is nothing but

∇φi (x) · ∇φ j (x) dΩ , b := {bi } =

(6)

where i, j = 1, . . . , N.
4.2. Expressing variational formlations in SPiNMe
As can be seen in Section 4.1, a fundamental component in the implementation of any FEM is the computation
of matrix A and vector b resulting from the variational formulation. This computation is usually accomplished by
iterating over the elements of the mesh and assembling the contribution from each element to A and b. In the SPiNMe
environment, the method building blocks for expressing variational formulations oﬀer the Author-Developer the necessary information to compute each element’s contribution to A and b. These building blocks are accessed through
two diﬀerent pieces of plug-in code, which must be implemented as Lua functions. The ﬁrst Lua function is an initialization function. It allows the initialization of variables related to variational formulations, such as number of state
variables, physical coeﬃcients, source terms, etc.
The second Lua function is a contribution function. It is responsible for the actual computation of the local
contributions of an element in a mesh to A and b. The contribution function must receive 4 arguments: (i) a data
structure containing information about the element over which the local contributions to A and b are to be computed—
∂φi
, where d = 1, . . . , D and D depends on the dimension of the mesh, (ii) a weight number
e.g. the values of φi and ∂x
d
used for computing the numerical integrations in Ai j and bi related with the element (which depends on the numerical
integration process being employed), (iii) a ek matrix containing the current values of Ai j related with the element,
and (iv) a ef vector containing the current values of bi related with the element. The post-conditions of this function
are the updated values of ek and ef. It is worth emphasizing that ek and ef are updated, since neighboring elements
in the mesh will contribute to the same entries Ai j and bi for some i and j.
As an example, Listing 1 shows the implementation of a Lua contribution function for the variational formulation
in (5) applied to a bidimensional (i.e. D = 2) mesh. The example assumes that f (x) in Equation (4) has been deﬁned
by a corresponding Lua initialization function.

5. Summary and Outlook
With the design presented herein, we aim at creating an environment for the easy implementation, comparison,
and sharing of classical and new numerical methods. As the SPiNMe environment will be accessible for use through
any computer with access to the Internet, a wide audience of users may be reached. Researchers will be able to make
use of a simple and easy tool with which to validate new methods.
Currently, the SPiNMe environment only allows for the implementation of variational formulations as plug-in
code. Our current eﬀorts are focused on oﬀering of an Author-Developer the option of implementing diﬀerent basis
functions and numerical integration processes as plug-in code. Currently, the SPiNMe environment oﬀers to the
Author-Developer piecewise polynomials as the only available basis functions and the Gaussian quadrature as the
only available numerical integration process.
In addition, we have identiﬁed two main directions for future work. First, we will extend the implementation of
the SPiNMe environment to families of numerical methods other than FEM. The design of the environment is similar,
with adaptations being necessary to the numerical method library (as new DFMs or FVMs for instance) and to the
method building blocks for the rapid prototyping of new methods as plug-in code.
Second, since data provenance has not been considered in our design, registering and tracking of actions taken
on a published numerical method is not explicitly supported. This is a highly desirable feature, as the number and
scope of numerical methods have been growing steadily over time. To this end, we will introduce the concept of phenomena in the SPiNMe environment, which will be responsible for encapsulating all information regarding a speciﬁc
phenomena arising in science (e.g. heat transfer, turbulent ﬂows). In addition to the description of such phenomena,
this concept will contain the partial diﬀerential equations and the numerical methods used to solve them, as well as
a repository ﬁlled with results of previous numerical simulations (and all information used for running them), experimental data, and bibliography related with the phenomena. Thereby, all the information and tools for understanding
some phenomenon will be linked to executable papers helping to meet the requirement of a reproducible simulation.
