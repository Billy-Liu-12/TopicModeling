Abstract
We developed a robust approach for real-time levee condition monitoring based on combination of
data-driven methods (one-side classification) and finite element analysis. It was implemented within a
flood early warning system and validated on a series of full-scale levee failure experiments organised
by the IJkdijk consortium in August-September 2012 in the Netherlands. Our approach has detected
anomalies and predicted levee failures several days before the actual collapse. This approach was used
in the UrbanFlood decision support system for routine levee quality assessment and for critical
situations of a potential levee breach and inundation. In case of emergency, the system generates an
alarm, warns dike managers and city authorities, and launches advanced urgent simulations of levee
stability and flood dynamics, thus helping to make informed decisions on preventive measures, to
evaluate the risks and to alleviate adverse effects of a flood.

1 Introduction
Levee condition monitoring is an important national concern: large land areas are protected by
levees (dikes). Cost of late detection of a ‘weak’ dike can be very high. For example, there were more
than one thousand levee failures in the Netherlands between 1134 and 2006 [1]. Comprehensive
analysis of various levee failure mechanisms can be found in [19]. Nowadays visual inspection is the
general way of collection of information about levee condition. The problem is that often deformations
that are visible at the surface mean that levee collapse is already in progress. It is important to get
warning signals earlier. Remote sensing or installation of sensors inside the object (in situ monitoring)
is usually applied. Installation of sensors can be more dangerous for the object but there are more
parameters that can be collected by in situ monitoring.
Collected from the sensors measurements are transmitted to the data base (Figure 1). This can be
done, for example, using the Common Information Space [2]. One of the most important problems is
analysis of the collected data. Experts are usually not able to analyse in on-line all the measurements
collected from the sensors. Delay in decision making can have severe consequences. Intelligent
monitoring systems are required for analysis of the collected stream of measurements and for support
in decision making. This paper is dedicated to development of an approach for support in decision
making. There are several research projects related to this issue, e.g. Flood Control 2015
(http://www.floodcontrol2015.com/). Analysis of risks in case of flash floods can be found in [20].
Routine monitoring thousands of kilometres of levees requires significant computational resources.
In critical situations (like storm forecast, heavy rains, or anomaly in the levee condition), increased
sampling rate from sensors requires a truly "urgent" high-performance computing with high-priority
resource allocation and extra simulations run on demand. Importance of such systems development
was shown in [6].

One of the general problems is that only patterns of normal behaviour are available. This
complicates development of methods for detection of real anomalies in data that correspond to onset
of levee collapse. Organisation of full-scale destructive experiments is required in order to verify that
onset of levee failure is detectable.
The IJkdijk consortium (http://www.ijkdijk.nl/) organised in 2012 several full-scale levee
destructive experiments (Booneschans, the Netherlands). Three levees (dikes) were constructed and
were affected by abnormal conditions that led to collapse of these objects. Collected sensor
measurements were analysed and visualised by several partners of the consortium. More information
can be found in [4] and [5].
The planned experiments have been carried out at three levees: West levee piping experiment (2126 August), East levee piping experiment (21-27 August), and South levee macro stability experiment
(3-8 September). The East levee is presented before start of the experiment in Figure 2(a). The East
levee collapsed on 27 of August (Figure 2(b)).
There are different types of sensors applicable for levee behaviour monitoring. Comprehensive
overview of sensor technologies can be found in [13]. The pore water pressure sensors proved to be
useful in levee stability analysis (e.g., detection of internal erosion) [10].

Pore pressure measurements were provided by Alert Solutions to the IJkdijk consortium in these
experiments. There were installed 3 cross-sections with 2 sensors (GeoBeads) within each crosssection at different depth for the West levee, 5 cross-sections for the East levee. Locations of sensors
are shown in Figure 3. Measurements collected from two sensors marked with red colour (AS 218 and
AS 213) were used for further analysis.
GeoBeads consists of fully digital sensor modules (nodes). The set per node commonly includes a
piezometer, an inclinometer and thermal sensors [14]. Pore pressure, inclination and temperature are
measured as a result.

The research objective of this paper can be formulated as development of the approach for realtime levee condition monitoring based on combination of different types of models with sensor
measurements collected from the monitored object. Validation of the developed approach during the
full-scale destructive (IJkdijk) experiment is presented. .

2 An Approach for Real-Time Levee Monitoring
There are two main classes of methods for levee behaviour analysis: data-driven (model-free
methods) and model-based (numerical or physical modelling). The first class includes different
techniques: machine learning methods (e.g., the artificial neural networks (ANN)), statistical methods
(e.g., central moments, linear correlation, clustering), soft computing, data mining and others. Datadriven models do not require information about physical parameters of the monitored levee (slope
geometry, soil properties etc.) as opposed to the physical modelling. This type of models requires only
information collected sensors installed into monitored object or results of remote sensing. The
corresponding block of the decision support system can be marked as Artificial Intelligence (AI).
We used one-side classification approach (Neural Clouds [8]) as the core method of this block. It is
based on advanced k-means clustering algorithms: multidimensional points related to the previously
known normal conditions are used to construct clusters of normal behaviour. The new points are
checked: if they are outside of clusters of normal behaviour they are interpreted as anomalies that can
be sign of onset of levee failure. In this case low confidence values of normal behaviour are produced
as output of the Neural Clouds (close to 0). Points that belong to the clusters of normal behaviour

A. Pyayt, et al.

produce high confidence values of normal behaviour (close to 1). More details can be found in [15],
[16] and [17].
Model-based approach (the second class of methods) requires information about the monitored
object (e.g., initial geometry and soil properties); the constructed model will not depend on on-line
measurements. Sensor values may be used for validation of the constructed model and as initial
conditions for the modelling. Finite element method is widely used to simulate structural behaviour of
dikes [3], [11], [12]. The corresponding block of the decision support system can be marked as
Computer Model (CM). This class of models provides more information about the monitored object
but it is hard to use these models for real-time behaviour assessment.
We presented first approaches to combine both classes of models in [18]. The possible variants of
combinations are described below. There are two different opportunities: (1) computer model can be
used for data generation or (2) for validation of the alarms generated by a data-driven model.
In the first case (Figure 4), the computer model can generate patterns of abnormal behaviour for
testing of the developed anomaly detection approach. The computer model can generate normal data if
there are no historical measurements but monitoring using data-driven methods has to be started
immediately.

In the second case (Figure 5), the computer model can be used for validation of the generated by
the data-driven methods alarms: if the real alarm was detected it is verified. If the false alarm was
generated, this can mean that new (previously unknown) state occurred, the component should be
retrained including these new measurements.

The second option is suitable for real-time processing when all the components are built (trained)
and the real object is monitored. We used in this paper the first option: computer model generated
artificial data of normal behaviour that was used for training of data-driven methods. Results of
computer modelling are presented in the next section.
Details about the second scheme details are published in [7].

3 Computational Model
The model that was constructed by the experts was based on documents and drawings provided by
Deltares; finite-element method and finite-element software PLAXIS, which is oriented at studying of
soil behaviour. The finite-element model is shown in Figure 6. East Levee consists of five main soil
parts presented in Figure 6.

Sand with chunks of clay

Figure 6. Geometry of East Levee.
Soils behave rather non-linear when subjected to changes of stress or strain. In reality, the stiffness
of soil depends at least on the stress level, the stress path and the strain level. The Mohr-Coulomb
model linear elastic perfectly plastic model was used for modelling. The linear elastic part of the
Mohr-Coulomb model is based on Hooke's law of isotropic elasticity. The perfectly plastic part is
based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion that is formulated in a non-associated plasticity
framework. Application of the Mohr-Coulomb model requires definition of four physical and
mechanical properties of soil: Young’s Modulus ȿref, Poisson’s Ratio Q, Cohesion Cref and Friction
Angle ĳ. Researched part of levee consist of five soil layers.
15-nodes 2-D elements were used. Each model has about 300 000 degrees of freedom. Soil
properties and geometry are nearly the same for whole levee. This means that construction of 2-D
model for one cross-section is enough for analysis of behaviour of the whole levee [9].

4 Results of Finite Element Analysis
This section contains those results of numerical modelling which have been compared with the
results of natural experiment with the aim of demonstration of applicability of finite element
modelling (FEM) for prediction tasks. Sensors measuring pore pressure values were selected for
comparison with results of numerical experiment (output of the FEM model). Hydraulic head (water
level) was used as the input parameter for modelling.
Distribution of pore pressure (pressure of water inside the levee) at different stages of natural
experiment is presented in Figure 7. It could be seen, that water rising at north side of the levee leads
to increasing the value of pore pressure. Also it should be mentioned that high pore pressure front has
non-linear shape under levee body and moves from north to south side of the levee (from right part to
the left part of the cross-section in Figure 7) during the experiment.

Figure 7. Distribution of pore pressure: (a) at initial state; (b) the water level is 1.6 m (approximate
position is shown with blue dashed line); (c) the water head is 2.8 m; (d) the water head is 3.4 m. Blue
color corresponds to zero value of pore pressure, red color illustrates maximum value of pore pressure
during simulations.
Figure 8 shows comparison between results produced by the computer model (CM) developed by
Siemens and measurements collected from the pore pressure sensors. The first virtual sensor is marked
as ‘AS 213’, the second sensor – ‘AS 218’. Each step in time series reflects the increase of water level
inside the levee. Small shifts between steps for real and virtual measurements are caused due to small
offsets between initial planning and execution of the plan of the experiment.
For both sensors behaviour look similar till some point in the middle of Figure 8. Deviation
between real sensor measurements and modelled values (after midnight on the 25th of August) can be
used for identification of anomaly using data processing methods. Starting from this moment till the
end experiment (collapse on the 27th of August) levee can be evaluated as ‘unstable’.

5 Anomaly Detection on the Example of the East Levee
The Neural Clouds were trained on pair of virtual sensors (the whole available data set – blue
colour in Figure 8 and Figure 9) and tested on a real sensor, AS 213, measuring pore pressure and
Deltares sensor measuring hydraulic head (the whole available data set – green colour). Figure 10
presents clusters constructed on basis of virtual sensors. Black and red points are related to test set:
black points are related to clusters related to normal conditions, red point are related to abnormal
behaviour.

6 Conclusions
This paper is dedicated to development a robust real-time levee condition monitoring system,
based on a combination of data-driven anomaly detection with computational models. The
computational models (e.g. finite element modelling) are precise enough for evaluation of the levee
condition but it remains hard to be applied to real-time monitoring. Data-driven methods are based on
measurements collected from sensors installed into monitored object. They provide fast response
based on new data but they can easily provide false alarms due to different reasons (e.g. new normal
state not presented in test set).
We show that combination of these two approaches is required for robust real-time condition
monitoring as a part of the decision support system: in this case the operator of the monitoring system
has to analyse only specific events detected by the system but not all the collected sensor data.

FEM was used for generation of virtual sensor data related to normal levee behaviour taking into
account changing external conditions (water level). We used a one-side classification [8] approach for
anomaly detection, this requires for training only data related to normal conditions. If the new point
does not belong to the clusters of normal behaviour it is interpreted as anomaly.
Operability of the developed approach was validated during the full-scale destructive experiments
organised in 2012 by the IJkdijk consortium. Computational models proved to be robust and issued
and alarm in several before dike collapse, therefore providing valuable input for decision support.
The advantage of the developed approach that it is applicable to complex anomalies detection but
in some easy cases like presented in this paper some other simpler methods can be used (e.g. threshold
check).
The presented in this work anomaly detection approach can be applied for monitoring of various
structures: it can be used for artificial (e.g., bridge, concrete dam, or building) or natural (e.g., levee)
construction monitoring. The only requirement is installation of sensors that provide information about
important parameters and availability of an on-line data stream for on-line analysis.
