Abstract
We developed a levee health monitoring system within the UrbanFlood project funded under the EU 7th Framework
Programme. A novel real-time levee health assessment Artificial Intelligence system is developed using data-driven
methods. The system is implemented in the UrbanFlood early warning system. We present the application of dedicated
signal processing methods for detection of leakage through the water retaining dam and subsequent analysis of the
measurements collected from one of the UrbanFlood pilot levees at the Rhine river in Germany.

1. Introduction
Recent statistical analyses indicate that the number of floods on our planet is still increasing [1]. There are
about four times more floods registered nowadays as compared to the 1980s. In many cases levee/dike/dam
collapse triggers further flooding [2, p. 86-87]. According to statistics, most dam failures are caused by
overtopping, foundation defects, piping and seepage [2, p. 99] that occur due to the problems in structural

design, to underestimation of possible extreme flood and to the lack of understanding of geological properties
beneath and around the dam.
According to a study of dam failures in the USA [3] overtopping is the reason of 34% of floods. Foundation
defects due to differential settlement, slides, slope instability, uplift pressures, and foundation seepage lead to
30% of all dam failures. Failure due to piping and seepage accounts for 20% of all failures. The remaining 16%
of failures are caused by the problems with conduits and valves, and other miscellaneous problems.
1735 dikes failed in the Netherlands between 1134 and 2006 [4]. 67% of the events were caused by erosion
of inner slope protection, 11% by ice drift, 6% by erosion or instability of outer slope protection, 5% by sliding
inner slope, 4% by external reason (human and animal), 3% by sliding outer slope, 2% by liquefaction of shore
line, 1% by piping, 1% by micro instability, horizontal shear and other related mechanisms.
A conclusion that can be drawn from these statistics is that there are many mechanisms of levee failure that
require constant levee health monitoring. Visual inspection will not guarantee detection of an onset of a levee
failure early enough to prevent its collapse. Development of physical models provides a robust solution for
levee behaviour assessment [24], but usually does not include real-time health monitoring. On-line monitoring
requires installation of sensors into the levee to provide full information about behaviour of the object.
Pore water pressure values play an important role in levee stability analysis [5, p. 42-43]. Inclinometers are
generally used to measure tilt and to monitor lateral movements for embankments and dams [6, p. 788].
Leakage might be detected using fibre optic sensors measuring distributed temperature along the levee [7]. A
detailed overview and comparison of existing sensor technologies for levee monitoring can be found in [8].
It must be emphasized that automated generation of alarms using real-time streams of measurements
requires dedicated data-driven methods. For instance, in [9] the application of singular value decomposition to
distributed temperature values is suggested for automatic leakage detection. Artificial neural networks were
applied for slope stability analysis in [10].
Modern sensor technologies and intelligent data processing methods should be used for early detection of
collapse processes. Both approaches are used within the UrbanFlood project. In this paper, we present the
results of levee health monitoring based on the anomaly detection approach developed in the UrbanFlood
project.
2. The UrbanFlood approach to levee health monitoring using signal processing methods
One of the main goals of this project is the development of an on-line early warning system based on levee
health monitoring [11-12]. Modern sensor networks were installed into several pilot sites in the Netherlands,
Germany and in the United Kingdom. More details about these pilot sites can be found in [13].
Data collected from sensors measurements are evaluated by the Artificial Intelligence component. If there
are anomalies due to different reasons (e.g., sensor fault, real developing failure), it produces an alarm. The
most important benefit of this approach is that it uses reference data related to normal behaviour of the
monitored object. This is possible due to a one-side classification approach using Neural Clouds (NC) [14].
The NC classification algorithm receives pre-processed data and a set of extracted features as an input. The
core of the NC classification agent (a single classification algorithm) is a combination of an Advanced KMeans (AKM) clustering algorithm and an extended Radial Basis Functions (RBF) network approach.
The NC encapsulates all previously known configurations of selected parameters for a given training period
(Figure 1a). It provides more accurate classification of multidimensional data in normal and abnormal in
comparison to simple hypercube approach: red points in the Figure 1a are incorrectly classified by hypercube
approach to normal mode and are correctly classified by NC to abnormal mode. After training, the NC
calculates a confidence value for every new state of the dike, describing the confidence value of normal
behaviour.

Figure 1b shows 3D presentation of the NC: X-Y plane contains 2D data shown in the Figure 1a, Z-axis
interprets behaviour of the monitored object: value close to 1 is related to normal behaviour, values close to 0
can be interpreted as anomalies.
Each one-side classification instance can use raw or pre-processed data, e.g. frequency or time-frequency
transformation - Fourier or wavelet transformation.

Sensor measurements

Multidimensional sensor measurements can be grouped according to a so-called physical redundancy (see
Figure 2): neighbour sensors, sensors from the same cross-section or sensors measuring the same physical
parameters can be analyzed by one one-side classifier. Another way of grouping is evaluation of analytical
redundancy between the sensors: sensors are grouped if a relation between sensor values is detected. Stability
of detected dependency is to be monitored in this case. More details about the use of this one-side classifier
method can be found in Pyayt et al. [15-16]. In the next two sections we present the results of monitoring one
of the UrbanFlood pilot sites, the Rhine levee.
All these algorithms are implemented within the AI component [15] of the UrbanFlood early warning
system. This component architecture utilizes the cloud computing infrastructure of the EWS efficiently. Each
AI component instance is a separate Virtual Machine (VM) working on a virtualization host. Any required
number of AI components can be started and configured.

3. Rhine levee data analysis
3.1. Rhine dike installation
There are two types of sensors installed into the Rhine levee: Alert Solutions (GeoBeads) in 2 cross-sections
and a GTC Kappelmeyer fibre optic cable (250 m) placed across the levee (Figure 3). One of two Alert
Solutions cross-sections is presented in the Figure 3. GeoBeads sensors provide temperature, pore pressure and
inclination measurements in on-line mode [17].
Placement of the GTC Kappelmeyer fibre optic is marked in the Figure 3 in orange. The fibre optics provide
spatio-temporal temperature measurements across the levee.

Figure 3. Alert Solutions sensors (marked with green balloons – left part of the picture, marked with blue circles – right part of the picture)
and GTC Kappelmeyer fibre optic cable (marked with orange line) installed into the Rhine levee – second cross-section, left slope –
waterside slope of the levee, right – landside slope

It must be emphasized that GTC Kappelmeyer uses a heat-pulse method that provides robust seepage
detection: fibre is heated and possible leakage might be detected during the cooling-down phase. This is a socalled active method which, in comparison a passive method (without heat-up), can detect leakage in autumn
and spring due to similar water and ground temperature. More details might be found in [7].
Pore pressure measurements gathered from Alert Solutions sensors are converted to water level values
(Figure 4a). Each colour corresponds to a specific sensor (for example: the “E2” sensor is marked with red in
Figure 4a,b). There are two lines per colour (sensor): a straight line indicates the height of the sensor
installation in relation to water level, curve lines present a change of water height – if the water level is above a
straight line, then this sensor is “covered” with water.
The two green dotted boxes in the Figure 4a indicate the dates when the water level was higher than the
ground water level (G1 sensor): 1st box - 9th of January 2012, 2nd box – 25th of January 2012. These peaks

Alexander L. Pyayt et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2357 – 2366

2361

correspond to peaks in the Rhine water level of ~ 820 cm (09.01.2012) and ~ 710 cm (25.01.2012) [18].
According to the reported data [18] the levee was wet, but “strong seepage flow (> 10-4 m/s) can be excluded.”
Summarizing all the abovementioned items, Alert Solutions sensors are useful for levee behaviour
classifications (dry/wet). If piping starts close to the GeoBeads sensors, it will be easily detected. GTC
Kappelmeyer fibre optic sensor should be applied for leakage test between cross-sections.

timestamps, rate – 1 hour (period: November 2011 - February 2012). b) Positions of sensors plotted in the a) part of the Figure, left slope –
waterside slope of the levee, right – landside slope

3.2. Analysis of measurements
In this section we describe the collected GTC Kappelmeyer temperature measurements and the associated
analysis. The process of a fibre optic heat-up is presented in the Figure 5.
As it was mentioned, there was no piping detected. We detected, however, a so-called “air bubble” (Figure 5
– dotted bow) that was caused due to problems with the fibre optic cable installation: a cable was surrounded
with air which has a lower thermal conductivity in comparison to the ground that covers the rest of the cable.
The temperature across the whole cable is more or less the same during the heat-up process – about 28-30
degrees, but for the 209-221 m the temperature rises significantly. This effect might be interpreted as an
anomaly.
There are different approaches to detect a rapid change in time series, e.g. Student’s T-test [19], a detailed
overview of such detection methods is presented in work [20]. Application of wavelets for abrupt fault
detection is illustrated in [21]. In [22] wavelets were applied for analysis of water temperature measurements
from the ‘Wivenhoe’ Dam. Each signal was decomposed using wavelets into daily, sub-annual and annual
(DSA) components. Each of the components was used for further analysis.
Time-frequency methods for data pre-processing were previously applied in the UrbanFlood project in [16],
where Short Time Fourier Transforms were used for pre-processing the Zeeland levee data. The Maximum
Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) [23] is selected as a pre-processing procedure for Rhine levee
data analysis. 8 levels of decomposition (“la8”: least asymmetric wavelet with 8 levels of decomposition) are
presented in the Figure 6.

Coefficients corresponding to the third and fourth levels of decomposition (Figure 6) after pre-processing
were used as input for one-side classifier. Measurements related to the cold fibre and several first minutes of
heat-up were used for the NC training.
Values in the spatial time series after 10 minutes of heat-up (Figure 7a) are presented as normal/abnormal
points in the Figure 7b: values close to 1 correspond to normal behaviour, close to 0 are interpreted as
anomalies. Classification of the points in Figure 7a is clarified in Figure 7c that represents a 2D view of the
constructed Neural Clouds. A cluster with normal data, related to the training set, is presented in Figure 7c with
blue points, the test set is presented with black points and detected outliers are marked in red.
MODWT doesn’t not have ’perfect’ localization properties according to the Gibbs phenomenon [23], that is
why some points are not correctly classified as abnormal behaviour: lower points in Figure 7c correspond to
normal temperatures in Figure 7a.
This example proves in principle the functionality of the developed anomaly detection method. Application
of this method to real-world leakage detection is presented in the next section.

4. Retaining dam data analysis
GTC Kappelmeyer provided for further testing of the developed anomaly detection method a real example
of abnormal behavior, registered in measurements collected at earth filled dam with bitumen sealing (total
length > 2 km). It contained a leakage of a bitumen sealing made of asphalt-coated gravel and bitumen binder
of the dam. This anomaly is presented in spatial time series as a rapid drop in the interval around 150 meter
(Figure 8).
MODWT has been applied for spatio-temporal time series pre-processing (“la8”, 8 levels of decomposition).
The calculated wavelet coefficients are presented in the Figure 9. Coefficients corresponding to the second and
third levels of decomposition after pre-processing were used as input for the one-side classifier.

5. Discussion and conclusions
Novel signal processing methods for anomaly detection in measurements gathered from sensor networks
installed into dams are presented. Two sensor networks installed into the Rhine levee – one of the UrbanFlood
[11] pilot sites - were considered: Alert Solutions and GTC Kappelmeyer. Alert Solutions sensors (GeoBeads)
can measure pore pressure, inclination and temperature. They proved useful for identification of various levee
failure modes. GTC Kappelmeyer fibre optic cable measures temperature following the so-called active
principle where the cable is heated.
Two types of anomalies were considered in this work. The first –“air bubble”– was associated with the
installation of fibre optic cables across the Rhine levee. This levee is not affected by leakage; no other
anomalies were found. The second data set that contains a pattern of real leakage at the retaining dam was
provided by GTC Kappelmeyer. Both data sets were analyzed using an anomaly detection scheme developed
within the UrbanFlood project. The anomalies have been detected as a rapid change in the spatial time series.
One of the main methods is the one-side classifier (Neural Clouds (NC) [14]) that doesn’t require anomalies in
a training set. The presented one-side classification approach has been successfully applied also for other levees
health monitoring [15-16].
Application of the NC for available data analysis is not possible without special pre-processing because
absolute values are changing during heat-up. Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) was
selected as a pre-processing procedure. This method is useful for detection of a rapid change in the observed
time series. A combination of time-frequency pre-processing and one-side classification seems to provide
robust identification of anomalies for both spatio-temporal data sets. Automatic selection of parameters of
signal processing procedures is one of the next steps of research.
It must be emphasized that detection of leakage is an important issue, even though leakage by itself is not a
specific criterion of a possible levee collapse. Levee behaviour assessment should always be carried out by
physical models and experts.
The presented anomaly detection approach can be used for any complex object monitoring. This approach is
implemented within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) component that can be integrated in any existing decision
support system. Condition monitoring using the UrbanFlood early warning system provides scalable solution:
required number of Virtual Machines (VM) containing AI component will be started in the cloud computing
infrastructure of the EWS on demand.
