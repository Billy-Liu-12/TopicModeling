Abstract. PYR, a first Cellular Automata model for pyroclastic flows, generated by collapsing volcanic columns, is reported in this paper. It was applied to
the 1991 Pinatubo eruption (Philippines islands). The model is very simple, but
it is able to capture the three-dimensional evolution of the phenomenon in so far
as it spreads. Results of the simulations are enough satisfying, if the comparison
between real and simulated event is performed, considering the area involved by
the event and the thickness of the deposit.

1 Introduction
Pyroclastic flows are fluidized masses of rock fragments and gases that move rapidly
in response to gravity. They can form following the collapse of an eruption column.
The flow contains water and gas from the eruption, water vapor and air can be enclosed as it moves downslope; pyroclastic flows can move at rates of 200 m/s [3].
At Mount Pinatubo in the Philipines, pyroclastic flow deposits were 220 m thick in
some valleys but averaged 30 to 50 m thick in others [6], [14]. Pyroclastic flows represent a greatest volcanic hazard; they can incinerate, burn, and asphyxiate people.
More people have died due to these hazards than any other volcanic hazard [4].
Differential equations, ruling complex non-linear systems as pyroclastic flows, are
very complex and need numerical methods for approximate solutions of real cases.
Computer simulation of pyroclastic flows is thus an important goal in order to minimise the hazard, associated to the phenomenon. Cellular Automata (CA) and derived
models [8], [12] are widely utilised for simulating complex fluid dynamical systems,
whose evolution depends on the local interactions of their constituent parts.
Our research group developed PYR, a first minimal two-dimensional CA model for
simulating pyroclastic flows, generated by collapsing volcanic columns. CA computational methods for modelling macroscopic phenomena (adopted successfully in the
past to lava and debris flows [8]) are here revised and extended to pyroclastic flows.

PYR has been tested on a real case event, namely the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption
that occurred in the Philippines. The first simulations are encouraging, regarding the
extension of the covered area and deposition distribution. They represent a basis to
expand this elementary model in order to improve the description of complex geological characteristics of such flows as degassing, deposition and granulometry.
The next section outlines the model, the CA transition function is described in the
third section, the Pinatubo eruption features are illustrated in the fourth section, the
simulation results are reported in the fifth section, at the end some conclusions.

2 The CA Model for the Simulation of Pyroclastic Flows
CA are based on a regular division of the space in regular cells (cellular space), each
one embedding an identical finite automaton (fa), whose input is given by the states of
neighbouring cells; fa have an identical transition function, which is simultaneously
applied to each cell. At time t=0, fa are in arbitrary states and the CA evolves changing the state of all fa simultaneously at discrete times, according to the transition function of the fa [8].
An empirical method [8], applied successfully to macroscopic phenomena, as lava
flows [2], [5] and debris/mud flows [7], [1], [10], was followed and adapted to particular features of pyroclastic flows. The following assumptions are adopted:
- Each characteristic, that is considered relevant to the evolution of the system and
relative to the space portion corresponding to the cell, is individuated as a substate.
The set of states is the Cartesian product of the sets of substates.
- As the state of the cell can be decomposed in substates, the transition function may
be split in many local interactions: the “elementary” processes. Their composition
generates the complexity of the phenomenon. The elementary processes are applied
sequentially according a defined order.
- The pyroclastic matter content of each cell is ideally divided in as many parts as the
number of the neighbourhood cells; each part is compared with the adjacent part of
the neighbouring cell. A pyroclastic flow between the two parts is determined in
order to minimise the height differences; height is comprehensive of altitude, deposit thickness and pyroclastic matter elevation.
The phenomenon evolution is considered since the beginning of the column collapse
phase (comprehensive of an initial feeding) up to the exhaustion of the deposition
phase; some simplifications concerning the phenomenon nature are assumed:
- The pyroclastic matter (gas and solid particles) is considered homogeneous in its
composition; its behaviour is not considered dependent on the temperature.
- Pyroclastic matter attributes (inside the cell) are specified by elevation, coordinates
and velocity of its barycentre.
- Complex behaviours as turbulence are reduced to simple displacements of pyroclastic matter between couples of cells; of course the energy loss is modelled in
such a way that high energy in pyroclastic flows, corresponding to turbolence conditions, involves larger energy losses according to reasonable empirical laws.

2.1 PYR Main Specifications
PYR is a deterministic two-dimensional CA model for pyroclastic flows with square
cells; it is defined by the septuple PYR = <R, G, X, S, P, σ, γ> where:

- R = {(x, y)| x, y ³ N, 0  x  lx, 0  y  ly} is the set of points with integer coordinates in the finite region, where the phenomenon evolves. N is the set of natural
numbers.
- G is the set of cells, corresponding to the area, where the volcanic column begins to
collapse; such cells generate the pyroclastic phenomenon.
- The set X = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)} identifies the geometrical pattern of
the cells, which influence the cell state change. The cell (0,0) is called the central
cell.

- S = SA  SX  SY  SZ  SE  SV  STH  SOE  SOV  SIE  SIV is the set of states; the
meaning of the substates is specified in table 1.
- P = {ps, pt, per, ppdr , pSP, pG} is the finite set of PYR global (invariant in time and
space) parameters, which effect the transition function; their meaning is specified in
table 2.

- s:S S is the deterministic state transition. It is specified by four elementary processes in application order: degassing and particles deposition, internal shift of the
pyroclastic column, outflows, composition of outflows and inflows inside the cell.
- g:NSE specifies the feeding of pyroclastic material for cells of G, where the
volcanic column begins to collapse. N is referred to the steps of CA.

corresponding outflows in the neighbourhood cells.

Note that PYR is two-dimensional, but the third dimension is effectively introduced
because the morphology is represented by values of SA, the deposit thickness is specified by the values of STH, the elevation of the column of solid particles is specified by
values of SE, SZ values refer to the co-ordinate Z of its barycentre.
The co-ordinates X and Y are related to the center of the cell; the co-ordinate Z is
related to the sea level. Note that the execution of each elementary process updates the
values of the involved substates.
Initial conditions are given by specifying the values of SA according the morphology; only the cells, corresponding to the space portion where the volcanic column
begins to collapse, have values of SE different from zero; the pyroclastic content is
considered to be distributed homogeneously starting from the surface: the pyroclastic
column inside the cell rests on the soil and the barycentre co-ordinates X and Y are
null.
The values of substates, concerning flows, are initially null.

3 PYR Transition Function
The “elementary” processes are specified in terms of equations or expressed as Pascallike procedures, where names of parameters and substates are derived by the lower
indexes specified in the section 2.1: the parameter pname is indicated as name; sname,
D_sname and n_sname indicate respectively the value of substate Sname, its variation and the
new value; when the specification of the index i of a neighbourhood cell is necessary,
the notation sname[i] is adopted; a couple of index i, j needs for the flows: sFname[i,j]
means the value of the flow substate name from the cell i toward the cell j in the
neighbourhood (i=0 for the outflows, j=0 for the inflows).
3.1 Degassing and Particles Deposition
Pyroclastic flow degassing and particles deposition are obtained by a simple empirical
law: at each step a segment (it is pelr during a second) of the pyroclastic column is lost
the corresponding part of gas leaves the column and the corresponding part of particles
is deposited.
The following Pascal-like procedure illustrates this elementary process:

procedure degassing_deposition; ………
begin
D_sE := t * elr;
if D_sE > sE then
begin
n_sTH := (SP * sE) + sTH;
n_sE := 0
end
else
begin
n_sTH := (SP * D_sE) + sTH;
n_sE := sE – D_sE
end
end;

3.2 Internal Shift of the Pyroclastic Column
The pyroclastic column inside the cell could not lay on the surface (soil or pyroclastic
deposit); in this case the barycentre must reach the “objective point” (i.e., the column
must reach the surface and the co-ordinates x and y of the barycentre must be null);
this shift (distance d) of the barycentre from the initial point to the objective point is
managed by the following empirical equations (1), (2), (3), (4), where the motion of
the pyroclastic column is depending on the gravity force, that is opposed by friction
forces. An asymptotic velocity limit is considered because the effect of the friction
forces increase as the velocity increases. The following four equations, similar to the
Stokes equations, are adopted; they are deduced in sequence: F is the force, m is the
mass of the pyroclastic matter inside the cell, t is the time, v is its velocity, v0 is the
initial velocity, q is the angle of the path slope to the objective point, a is the friction
parameter. The equation (4) computes the length Dl covered in a time Dt.
F = mg senq -a m v .

(1)

dv/dt = g senq - a v .

(2)

-αt

v = (v0 – g senq / a) e + (g senq / a) .
-α∆t

Dl = (v0 – g senq / a)(1 - e )/ a + (g senq / a)Dt .

(3)
(4)

The CA step could be insufficient in order to cover the distance (d>Dl for Dt=step). In
this case the new co-ordinates of the barycentre are determined. Conversely, if the
objective point is reached, then outflows may be permitted for the residual time of the
CA step, if the appropriate conditions occur (next subsection).

3.3 Outflows
The pyroclastic column is divided in four parts in correspondence of the neighbouring
cells (barycentres with same Z, different X and Y). Each part (1/4 of the mass) is
sensible only to the corresponding part of the neighbouring cell. The computation of
outflows is based on the difference of height (in this case, height is the sum of altitude,
pyroclastic deposit and pyroclastic column); there are two constrains: the maximum
outflow is 1/4 of the mass (fig.1a), the top of the outflow in the arrival cell don’t have
to be higher than the bottom of the outflow in the departure cell (fig.1b).
The barycentre follows the path with velocity computed according the formulae of
the previous subsection. Outflow is composed as inflow in the neighbouring cell with
other inflows and the residual part of pyroclastic column (next subsection).

Fig. 1. A path of outflow between two adjacent cells (in vertical section) is shown in two cases:
the altitude is in darker grey, the deposit is in lighter grey, the pyroclastic column elevation is in
dotted filling. Initial conditions are at the left, the path is drawn at the right for both figures

3.4 Composition of Outflows and Inflows inside the Cell
This last “elementary” process calculates the final values of the substates elevation,
considering balance of outflows and inflows; new co-ordinates and velocity of the
barycentre are obtained by a weighted average.

4 The Pinatubo 1991 Eruption
Mount Pinatubo is situated on the island of Luzon, about 80 km northeast of Manila,
the capital of the Philippines. The volcano started its activity about 1.1 million years
ago and is characterised by a set of lava domes surrounded by thick deposits of pyroclastic materials. The eruptive activity is scanned by eruptions separated by diverse
centuries of quiescence; eruptions are mainly explosive, of large intensity, character3
ised by emissions of diverse km of ash and pumices usually followed by the formation
of lava domes. The 1991 eruption is one of the major eruptions of this century. Mt.
Pinatubo has returned to activity after a rest of more than 600 years [14].

Fig. 2. The effects of the 1991 eruption of the Pinatubo. The areas in darker grey around the Mt
Pinatubo represent the deposits. The white frame encloses the Sacobia river valley

The flows that were generated in the 1991 eruption and their ash clouds travelled
2
for about 15 km from the main vent, covering an area of ca 400 Km (fig.2). The major part of the deposits consists of pumiceous pyroclastic flows with minor lithic-rich
facies. Their asymmetric distribution is strongly controlled by the pre-eruptive morphology of the area. In fact, the western morphology of the volcano is relatively flat
with respect to the eastern part, which is more mountainous. The steep morphology of
the southern and southeastern part could have deviated the flow towards southwest in
the Marella valley. In the same way, even the flows towards north and northeast could
have been deviated toward northwest in the O’Donell and Bucao valleys due to the
steep morphology which is present in the north-east area. The only flow that has deposited material in the eastern part of the volcano is situated in the Sacobia and Pasing
Rivers valleys [6], [14].
Our simulations refer exclusively to the Sacobia area (fig.2, inside the white frame)
because of the good pre and post eruption available geo-morphological data. The pre-

340

G.M. Crisci et al.

eruptive and post-eruptive geomorphologic maps have been obtained by computer
generated DEMs by A. Daag and J. C. van Westen [6]. The post-eruptive situation is
represented by fig.3.a, where the area occupied by the pyroclastic flow is shown.

5 Simulation Results
The PYR model is an empirical instrument based on the paradigm of the Cellular
Automata, which are highly non linear systems. Therefore global parameters plays a
crucial role: very different simulations are generated changing slightly the parameters
value. Some parameter value is imposed by choices (ps, pstep) or by features of the
phenomemon (pSP, pG), some parameters are empirically deduced by the results of the
simulations in a range of reasonable values (pelr, pα).
Several simulations were carried out to devise the optimal empirical parameters of
the PYR model. The values of parameters, that are used in the best simulation (fig.3b),
are reported in the table 3.
Initial conditions of the phenomenon represent another crucial point: their evaluation is approximated, it can differ for different observers. The initial pyroclastic column before the collapse was estimated Km. 5 high; the initial area, underlying the
pyroclastic column, occupies hundred cells. The duration of the main event is estimated approximately one hour long.
The dimensions of the matrix are 264385, i.e., the number of cells of the CA along
the x and y directions that need to cover the extension of the studied area.
The application results of this CA first model to a real event, namely the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, are very encouraging. If the real event (fig.3a) is compared with the
simulated event (fig.3b), a good correspondence for the areas covered by the pyroclastic flow can be evidenced in the precision limits of the cell side. The main flow
paths are individuated correctly, the deposits of solid particles are realistic in the control effected on the final configuration of the simulation.
PYR was implemented in Delphi; the program permits step by step to read the substates values for each cell; the morphology is represented by level curves, the cells
corresponding to a surface covered by the pyroclastic flow became black (fig.3b).

6 Comment and Conclusion
Pyroclastic flow numerical models, used in simulation of real events, are not many.
Wadge et al. [13] simulated the pyroclastic flows generated by the 1996 eruption of
the Soufrire Hills volcano, Monserrat. Their method uses simplified equations; successful simulation of the flow avalanche component is the basis for surge simulations.
Itoh et al. [11] adopt physical and empirical assumptions, that define differential
equations, solved with finite differences method (similar to a CA approach). Interesting results were obtained for the Merapi volcano pyroclastic flows.
Other models are based strictly on physical equations and use sophisticated numerical methods, but they haven’t be utilised for happened cases , e.g. Dobran et al. [9].
The PYR model didn’t give inferior results than other simulations of real cases; but
it needs less approximations. The assumption, that the pyroclastic content in a cell is
sensible only to the next cell, is weak; it works for smallest step values. The minimisation algorithm [8] will be opportunely introduced in the new model.

Fig. 3. The pyroclastic deposits in Sacobia river valley after the 1991 eruption of the Pinatubo
are represented in darker grey in (a) for the real event and in black on surface curves in (b) for
the simulated event

This CA approach permits usually to start from simple models, that need few elementary processes and substates; then the model, so far developed, can be straightforwardly enriched, complicating the transition function and/or adding new elementary
processes and substates to account situations of increasing complexity.

When the model will be tuned for several different cases of pyroclastic flows, then
applications would be reliable in order to determine hazard areas.
