Abstract
There is an increasing availability of ﬂoating car data both historic, in the form of trajectory
datasets and real-time, in the form of continuous data streams. This paves the way for several
advanced traﬃc management services such as current traﬃc state estimation, congestion and
incident detection and prediction of the short-term evolution of traﬃc ﬂow. In this paper, we
present an analysis of using probe vehicles for reconstructing traﬃc state. We employ detailed
agent-based microscopic simulations of a real world expressway to estimate the state from
ﬂoating car data. The probe penetration required for accurate traﬃc state estimation is also
determined.

Introduction

Floating cars refer to moving probe vehicles which act as traﬃc sensors by providing information
regarding their position α (in terms of coordinates) and speed vα at regular intervals. The
locations provided via GPS receivers can be map-matched to roads on a map. In turn this mapmatched data can be used to reconstruct traﬃc state constituting the macroscopic quantities
density ρ, ﬂow Q and local speed V¯ . Identifying regions of uniform ﬂow and density will help
determine traﬃc patterns of interest such as jams, stop-and-go waves and changes in traﬃc
ﬂow especially in the face of events such as accidents. In this paper we develop a methodology
for aggregating ﬂoating car data (FCD) for accurate traﬃc state reconstruction. The minimum
probe penetration required for determining the traﬃc state is also determined by simulating
diﬀerent traﬃc ﬂow regimes on a real world expressway.
Reconstruction of traﬃc state in real-time using FCD (in the form of data streams) will also
enable initializing data driven traﬃc simulations for short term predictions of ﬂow. This can
lead to a symbiotic traﬃc simulation platform [2] where the simulation system beneﬁts from

the real time data provided by the physical system (the road network) which in turn beneﬁts
through mechanisms such as dynamic ramp metering and congestion aware routing [15].
Reconstructing traﬃc state from probe vehicles has been previously discussed in papers such
as [10, 8] and [6]. In this work we attempt to determine traﬃc density and ﬂow traditionally
computed through stationary devices such as loop detectors [3] and video cameras [4], using
FCD. Towards this end the contributions of this paper are 1. A methodology for obtaining aggregated macroscopic (speed, density and ﬂow) quantities
from the microscopic FCD consisting of (α, vα ).
2. An estimation of the minimum percentage of probe vehicles required for the macroscopic
traﬃc state reconstruction under diﬀerent traﬃc ﬂow regimes.

Existing Work

Using FCD as a means for estimating travel times and traﬃc state has received much attention
over the years. Papers such as [6] and [12] compute the average travel time on roads from the
average speed of the probes on that road. Techniques such as artiﬁcial neural networks are used
for short term predictions by using weighted aggregates of the past patterns [6]. While using
the trajectories of probe vehicles to detect events such as congestion and accidents has been
discussed in [1].
The percentage of probe vehicles required for reliable travel-time estimation has been discussed in papers such as [5] and [8]. The work in [10] is concerned with estimating the
percentage of probe vehicles for accurately determining the travel-time across the road-network
links. Based on numerical simulations (details of the simulation model are not provided), the
authors conclude that 1.5% penetration of probe vehicles are needed for accurate travel time
estimation.
While the authors of [8] estimate the probe penetration (to be around 2%) and the sampling
period to maximize traﬃc information by determining traﬃc time and space correlations. Two
spots are correlated in space if the correlation of average speeds in both the spots exceeds
a threshold. Thus, the traﬃc condition in a spot without measurements can be estimated if
the condition in a correlated spot is known, thus inﬂuencing probe penetration. Likewise the
correlation time measures the period over which the traﬃc conditions remain correlated in a spot
hence inﬂuencing the sampling period. The traﬃc time and space correlations were measured
using microscopic simulations. The details of the simulation parameters are not provided.
Similarly [5] deﬁnes conﬁdence intervals for accuracy in terms of average speed and travel
times across the links apart from spatial coverage as a function of probe penetration. The
authors conclude that 3% to 5% probe penetration is suﬃcient for conﬁdence levels of 90% and
above.
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts made at estimating traﬃc ﬂow
and density from FCD. This is generally due to the papers focusing mainly upon estimating
travels times from FCD which is in contrast to the requirements of a symbiotic traﬃc simulation
platform requiring knowledge of the current state in terms of ρ, Q and V¯ . Further, most employ
macroscopic models which do not take into account the heterogeneous driving characteristics
and vehicle lengths and instabilities arising due to lane changes. This results in optimistic
conclusions on the minimum probe penetration required. In this work we show that, provided
suﬃcient probe penetration, the traﬃc state constituting average speed and more importantly
density (and ﬂow) can be reliably measured.

Methodology

For determining the methodology for spatial aggregation of FCD and the minimum probe
penetration for accurate traﬃc state estimation, we employ agent-based microscopic traﬃc
simulations. Microscopic simulations of real world expressway were employed owing to lack of
real-world ﬂoating car data.
Once the (α, vα ) pairs for the road stretch simulated is obtained, an algorithm for partitioning the FCD is required for determining the aggregated values of traﬃc density and in turn,
the ﬂow. In order to do this, the partitioned regions must be microscopically large enough
to contain suﬃcient samples of (α, vα ) pairs and be macroscopically small to determine traﬃc
patterns of interest such as congestion and variations in ﬂow [14].
The ﬁrst method for spatial aggregation evaluated, naively divides the expressway into
uniform chunks of size 1.0 km each resulting in 13 segments in total. The second method
evaluated makes use of the topology of the expressway and divides it into segments between
on/oﬀ ramp pairs. The ﬁnal approach divides the expressway into M segments such that
the variance of the speeds within all segments are minimized. Formally, the goal is to ﬁnd
sections S1 , ... , SJ that minimize the total variance of the speeds given by

J
j=1 i∈Sj

(vi − V¯SJ ).

Where V¯SJ represents the average speed in section Sj . This computationally hard optimization
problem (due to the inﬁnite number of ways in which the expressway can be divided into J
sections) is solved using a top down greedy approach known as recursive binary splitting [9].
The constructed binary tree is split until a minimum of 10 samples are present in each leaf
node. The tree so grown is pruned (to prevent over-ﬁtting) using cost-complexity pruning [9].
The eﬃcacy for spatial aggregation is determined based on the best model ﬁt that can be
obtained for ρ as a function of V¯ . To quantify the reliability of the model, we make use of the
R2 Statistic. This metric used henceforth in this paper is a measure of model ﬁt in the form of
a proportion of variance explained by the model [9]. It takes a value between 0.0 and 1.0 and a
value close to 1.0 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the density is explained
by the predictor, which in this case is the speed V¯ .
Once the relationship between ρ and V¯ is established, we look at quantifying the accuracy of
traﬃc state estimation as a function of probe vehicle penetration for diﬀerent traﬃc conditions.
This helps to determine the minimum probe penetration required.

Experiments

Microscopic models describe traﬃc from the perspective of individual driver-vehicle units
(DVUs). These high-ﬁdelity simulations should ideally capture heterogeneities in traﬃc in
terms of diﬀerent vehicle classes (e.g. cars, trucks) and driver behaviors (e.g. intelligent, aggressive). Further, the microscopic simulations employed for this study also model stochastic
lane changes thus helping to reconstruct the spatiotemporal state of traﬃc with far greater
accuracy in comparison to macroscopic models. The movement of driver-vehicle units are characterized by acceleration models for longitudinal motion and lane change models for lateral
movement along the road. In this section, we provide the details of our microscopic simulation
and of the real world expressway in Singapore we simulate.

Traﬃc Simulation

The traﬃc simulation we have employed, is based on the SEMSim platform [16]. SEMSim is a
high ﬁdelity agent-based microscopic simulation. It uses the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [13]
and MOBIL [11] as the acceleration and lane change models respectively.
The IDM is an accident free model which ensures that a vehicle attains the desired velocity
at free ﬂow and maintains the safe bumper to bumper distance to the leading vehicle. It also
ensures that the acceleration is an increasing function of the speed and distance to the leading
vehicle and a decreasing function of its speed. MOBIL, the lane change model ensures that the
resultant accelerations and decelerations for a vehicle and its followers in the old and new lanes
does not exceed a safe threshold. A lane change is done only if a vehicle gains speed without
violating the safety and inconvenience (to the old and new followers) criteria.
The simulation takes as input a road network detailing the lanes constituting the roads to
be simulated. Road segments that don’t have a preceding road segment are considered sources
and those without a subsequent segment are sinks. The traﬃc thus ﬂows from the sources
to the sinks. Vehicles are created at each source as a Poisson process based on the equation
nextT imes = −lnU
λs . The parameter nextT imes represents the time of arrival of a vehicle on a
source road s. The mean inter-arrival time for s (in seconds) is given by λs . The parameter U
is a random number between 0 and 1. The mean inter-arrival times λs of vehicles on a source
link s controls the average vehicle density on all roads simulated. It represents the expected
value of the number of agents entering the simulation via a source road. The route taken by
each DVU is determined based on static turn ratios speciﬁed at each intersection. Other inputs
to the simulation include time, number of agents and probability distribution of other model
parameters.

For the experiments in this paper, we simulated a 13 km stretch of P.I.E (Pan Island Expressway) in central Singapore (Figure 1) with all on and oﬀ ramps. The on ramps and the ﬁrst
P.I.E link are sources, while all oﬀ ramps and the last link on P.I.E are sinks. Refer to the

of the ﬁrst road-segment on P.I.E. The average distance between two bottlenecks is around 565
m along this stretch of P.I.E. The turn ratios for all oﬀ-ramps is kept constant at 0.25. This
implies that 25% of all vehicles exit at a given oﬀ ramp while the remaining 75% of the vehicles
continue to travel on the main expressway. The number of lanes in the simulated stretch of the
expressway varies between 3 and 6.

Simulation Parameters

The microscopic traﬃc simulation of P.I.E was initialized with the parameters listed in Table 2.
Parameters such as a, b and li are modeled as distributions to take into account heterogeneous
driving behaviors and vehicle classes respectively. In order to obtain a ballpark ﬁgure for
congestion in terms of vehicle density, we make use of the simplest of the Lighthill Whitham
Richards (LWR) models using a triangular fundamental diagram [14]. The critical density for
congested traﬃc ρc , according to the LWR model is given by V0 ×TI+lef f . Here lef f represents
the minimum distance headway which is the sum of average vehicle length and minimum gap
s0 . Vehicle density exceeding ρc generally implies a congested traﬃc ﬂow regime.
Based on the parameters listed in Table 2, ρc works out to around 31 vehicles/km/lane.
Thus we consider traﬃc greater than 93 vehicles/km, (assuming the minimum of three lanes)
as congested. In fact, each traﬃc scenario (discussed later) is also characterized based on the
average vehicle density during the simulation period of 2 hours. It is to be noted that the
LWR based triangular fundamental diagram overestimates the critical density since it ignores
vehicular interactions such as lane changes and assumes homogeneous traﬃc, but nevertheless
serves as a rough estimate for congestion.

4.4

Simulation Scenarios

The traﬃc density (ρ) in number of vehicles/km across the expressway is controlled by varying
the average inter-arrival rates at all sources along P.I.E. The density of the entire expressway
is computed at the end of the two hour simulation by counting the number of distinct agents
per kilometer of the road. To simulate heavy congestion along P.I.E the parameter λs for all
on-ramps was set to a uniform random number between 2.0 sec and 2.5 sec (representing a ﬂow
of 1800-1440 vehicles/hour) while λs for the ﬁrst and only source link of P.I.E was set to 1.0 sec
(3600 vehicles per hour). The sampling period of all probe vehicles unless stated otherwise is

Figure 2 shows the spatiotemporal state of P.I.E in a heavily congested state. The heat
map represents the speed proﬁles of all the agents averaged over space and time intervals of 50
meters and 1 minute. Traﬃc build up in the form of blue bands are clearly visible in the regions
where on and oﬀ ramps intersect along the main P.I.E expressway. The average traﬃc density
along the main expressway (ignoring the on/oﬀ ramps) during the time period of simulation
was around 110 vehicles/km which is greater than the critical density ρc for P.I.E.
Figures 3a and 3b shows the spatiotemporal state of P.I.E during partial congestion and
non-peak traﬃc at average densities of 78 and 65 vehicles/km respectively. These scenarios as
discussed in Section 5.2 will be used to determine the minimum probe penetration required for
accurate traﬃc state estimation using FCD. Note that three scenarios simulated in Figures 2
through 3b assume a 100% probe penetration.

Results

In this section, we reconstruct the macroscopic traﬃc state of P.I.E by aggregating the speed
proﬁles of probe vehicles based on the three diﬀerent spatial aggregation techniques discussed
in Section 3. We also determine the minimum probe penetration required for accurate traﬃc
state estimation.

5.1

Spatial Aggregation of FCD

Figure 4a shows the plot of ρ(in vehicles/km) as function of V¯ when the P.I.E is divided into
equal sized segments of length 1.0km. The method does not take into account the topography
of P.I.E nor does it try to identify regions with a homogeneous distribution of speeds. While
Figure 4b shows the ρ vs V¯ graph by aggregating FCD based on the 25 road segments comprising
the P.I.E stretch simulated. Both the ﬁgures clearly establish an exponential relationship (based
on the linear regression ﬁt) between V¯ and ρ despite signiﬁcant bias.
The recursive binary partitioning approach (Section 3), divides P.I.E into homogeneous
partitions (numbering 12 in this case) based on the speed proﬁles of probe vehicles. Figure 4c
further establishes the exponential relationship between ρ and V¯ with much lesser noise in
comparison to splitting using the two aforementioned approaches. The exponential relationship
between ρ and V¯ in agreement with the Underwoods’s exponential model [7]. We thus ﬁt a
linear model as shown in Equation 1 for estimating traﬃc density from average speed. The
coeﬃcients β0 and β1 are the least squares coeﬃcient estimates for linear regression.
ρ = β0 + β1 × log(V¯ )

(1)

In the next section we show that the recursive binary splitting approach is the better method
for spatial aggregation of the (α, vα ) pairs considering lesser levels of probe penetration.

5.2

Probe Penetration for Eﬀective Density Estimation

In this section, we determine the accuracy of the exponential speed density model (Equation 1)
at diﬀerent levels of probe penetration. This helps determine the minimum probe penetration
required for the three diﬀerent traﬃc ﬂow regimes discussed in Section 4.4. We expect the

driver vehicle characteristics and stochastic lane changes. The aforementioned instabilities in
traﬃc ﬂow are modeled in the microscopic simulations as explained in Section 4.

level of congestion decreases. This can be explained by the fact that vehicles generally travel
at uniform speeds during heavy congestion (refer Figure 2) and during free ﬂow resulting in
minimum variance of speeds across lanes. While partially congested traﬃc regimes in Figures 3a
and 3b generally tend to have a far greater variance in speed due to vehicles traveling at varying
speeds in diﬀerent lanes.

Figure 7: Traﬃc ﬂow and temporal resolution estimation for recursive binary splitting
Using the relation Q = ρ × V¯ the ﬂow-density fundamental diagram is obtained as shown in
Figure 7a at probe penetration of 10%. The average speed V¯ and the density ρ were aggregated
using the recursive binary split for a two minute subinterval. The critical density for congestion
(ρc ) is around 100 vehicles/km for P.I.E.
Figure 7b provides the average R2 Statistic as a function of probe penetration and temporal
aggregation intervals. Five two minute sub intervals of the scenario shown in Figure 2 were

used for computing the aggregate R2 Statistic. Clearly the accuracy of the density prediction
decreases as the temporal aggregation interval increases. The graph indicates that acceptable
accuracy of density estimates from FCD (when used in conjunction with binary splitting) is
obtained at resolutions of around 15 to 20 seconds. This result thereby estimates the sampling
period of probe vehicles required for traﬃc sate estimation. Increase of the probe sampling
period to around 15 seconds signiﬁcantly reduces the computational resources required for realtime map matching and traﬃc state reconstruction.

Conclusions and Future Work

In this work we have established that reliably estimating traﬃc state and more speciﬁcally
density (and thereby ﬂow) on an expressway can be achieved with a minimum of 5% to 10%
probe vehicles depending upon the prevailing traﬃc conditions. Microscopic traﬃc simulations
reveal that recursive binary partitioning can be used to subdivide a stretch of road to identify
homogeneous regions of Q, ρ and V¯ .
In the future, we would like to investigate if the results obtained on a relatively homogeneous
expressway can be replicated on signalized urban street networks. Future work would also
involve optimizing the minimum variance partitioning of the road network to automatically
detect onset of congestion and anomalous events such as accidents based on statistical learning
methods. Accurate estimation of speed, density and ﬂows along important roads can help
initialize data driven simulations for short term predictions of the evolution of traﬃc ﬂows.
Predictive simulations will play a major role in enhancing the capabilities of dynamic control
strategies such as ramp metering and routing for traﬃc ﬂow optimization.
