Abstract
Blue Gene is a massively parallel system being developed at the IBM T. J.
Watson Research Center. With its 4 million-way parallelism and 1 Petaﬂop peak
performance, Blue Gene is a unique environment for research in parallel processing. Full exploitation of the machine’s capability requires 100-way shared memory parallelism inside a single-chip multiprocessor node and message-passing
across 30,000 nodes. New programming models, languages, compilers, and libraries will need to be investigated and developed for Blue Gene, therefore offering the opportunity to break new ground in those areas. In this talk, I will
describe some of the hardware and software features of Blue Genes. I will also
describe some of the protein science and molecular dynamics computations that
are important driving forces behind Blue Gene.
