indicators and economic factors; understanding social phenomena (e.g. crime) requires indicators; both expert-based and citizen-based recommendations come from the observation of key
regional indicators; the evolution of our cities (e.g. urban planning) and of its services (e.g.
public transport systems) depend on the capability of defining, building, analyzing and interpreting indicators. In practice, urban indicators play a significant role in multi-disciplinary
contexts due to their capability of synthesizing metrics to facilitate knowledge building and
monitor the impact of synergistic strategies.
The application-level perception of indicators defines a simple key rule: better indicators
imply better analysis capabilities. In technical terms however, the use of a certain indicator
depends first of all on the availability of the raw data required to calculate or estimate that
indicator. Moreover, the quality of a given indicator is directly proportional to the accuracy
of the raw data that underpin it. The current approach to urban indicators involves the systematic and accurate collection of the raw data required to produce reliable indicators and the
standardization of well-known, commonly accepted and widely adopted indicators. In addition,
mainly because of the intrinsic difficulty and cost to build granular data sets, urban indicators
are very often considered at the city level only and indeed they are referred to as global indicators because of their application to comparing big geographic regions globally. Unfortunately,
most potentialities of urban indicators reside in the fine-grained analysis concerning smaller
areas (e.g., suburbs within cities) which are very rarely addressed in the current platforms.
Within this paper, we are considering a novel scenario in which users are progressively
leaving the classic static context characterizing urban indicators to move towards a more flexible
and open model where indicators can be dynamically defined and changed according to the
available data and the scope of the target analysis. Thus, we are considering a technological
context, including the data ecosystem and the software environment, which is intrinsically
more complex than the common spatial data frameworks. To enable extensibility, flexibility
and interoperability, we propose an ontological approach to assure an enriched semantic data
structure supporting different platforms and applications in the domain.
Structure of the paper The next section 2 provides an overview of previous, related work
in this area; section 3 proposes a detailed description of the ontological framework that we have
developed; section 4 discusses the uncertainties and some current related limitations within the
current ontological model; finally, section 5 provides a summary of the achievements, future
directions and some concluding remarks.

Related Work

Over the past five years, semantic technologies have been extensively used in the context of city
data to address different issues, including the aggregation, the management and the processing
of data, as well as the integration of data from across disparate domains through ontological
approaches.
For instance, [1] focuses mainly on the collection of open city data which can be integrated,
enriched and eventually republished as linked data. More generally, the problem of exchanging
and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations according to a semantic approach has produced some notable solutions (e.g. the RDF Data Cube [2]). Adding a spatial
dimension to the Web of Data [3] represents a consolidated approach, as well as standard vocabularies may be extented to address specific requiremets [4]. Whilst, the QuerioCity platform
employs Semantic Web technologies to catalog, index and query heterogeneous information
generated by cities [5].

Ontologies are being extensively used in different contexts to achieve different goals different
from data aggregation. For example, upper-level ontologies for global city indicators [6] model
the city data domain from a theoretical perspective: as upper-level vocabularies, they facilitate
and push semantic interoperability among indicators; those vocabularies are playing a key
role in standardization. Although the general concept of Semantic GIS has been extensively
addressed, as has the semantic representation of space [7] and complex reasoning over it, many
potential applications of the semantic technology to urban data models appear to remain largely
unexplored.
The work described in this paper, reflects a more pragmatic approach which aims to develop
platforms and tools that assume a dynamically evolving concept of indicator. Indeed, in our
understanding, an indicator is not something that is pre-defined and pre-calculated. On the
contrary, it can be defined or re-defined along the way in response to different needs, requirements and scopes. Furthermore, we are considering a fine-grained model of indicator which is
designed to support accurate and detailed analysis. In addition, we assume that the indicators
are derived from distributed, pervasive and growing data sources on the cloud, that are programmatically accessible via APIs. We are not aiming at iterative extensions to the current
platforms and tools dealing with urban indicators; rather, we are targeting a new generation of
urban indicator services.

Ontological Framework

Semantic technology can contribute to the development of rich and effective environments
for managing, processing and sharing urban data sets and indicators, at multiple levels to
achieve different goals. Our approach promotes integrated solutions whereby the ontological
representation of the information provides a semantic layer, namely enriched data structures,
to support the development of novel platforms in open contexts.
The ontological framework objective of this paper has been designed to cater for a wide
range of applications. From a knowledge representation perspective, it can be characterized by
the following key principles:
• Conceptualization and semantic support. The ontological framework addresses indicators from a practical perspective. This doesn’t assume a model where the conceptualization is not relevant or not playing a primary role. It is, on the contrary, is still
a primary concern. Indeed our high-level profiles for indicators support multiple points
of view including the structure, the description in a natural language, the provenance,
categorization and classification, all based on open vocabularies. In other words, we are
not just saying what an indicator is, but also how it is composed, how it is calculated,
for which purpose in a given context, how it is related to other indicators or entities.
Therefore, our approach is not alternative but rather complementary with the emerging
open domain vocabularies (e.g.[6])
• Functional support to software platforms. Different applications of urban indicators may present very different requirements. But we anticipate that most systems will
converge on a set of key functionalities. The use cases that we are currently considering
are increasingly demanding the dynamic composition and run-time computation of indicators from distributed, raw, timely datasets. Our ontology is designed to provide a solid
support for such functionalities in the context of dynamic interoperability.

• Focus on data interoperability. Indicators are the result of some logical or mathematical processing of raw data. Therefore, dealing with dynamic indicators means addressing
dynamic data aggregation in federated distributed environments. Because different architectures adopt different perspectives to data and data repositories, a flexible mapping
model is one of the critical design issues: it should either allow datasets to remain in their
legacy repositories or enable them to be imported in a semantic format to become part of
the system. The former class of solutions is, a priori, more suitable to address scalability
and consistency requirements but implies a more sophisticated aggregation mechanism
and, of course, a more complex semantic support; the latter is a much simpler solution
in terms of architecture design and semantic support. But the latter approach requires
specific mapping mechanisms to ensure data consistency and, at least in theory, additional
computational resources to manage large sets of semantically enriched data.
• Agnostic approach to the geographic space model. The geographic space model
is a critical asset for urban indicators as they are the result of computations on spatial
data. However, there are a lot of models for the geographic space currently in use and
the unification of those models within a unique universally accepted model is unrealistic.
It is also important to take into account that specific studies could require ad-hoc models
for the geographic space. For these reasons, our approach does not assume a well-defined
model for the geographic space but rather provides a set of concepts and properties to
represent different models and standards depending on the final user needs and on the
available data. The relations among different models will also be significant in applications
that integrate data related to more than one data model; however such integration (or
spatial correlation) is also likely to introduce uncertainties (see section 4).
In the next sub-sections we first provide a conceptualized overview of the framework; than
we move towards the description of its implementation as an OWL Ontology; finally we will
discuss the ontological support provided in the context of a reference architecture.

3.1

Conceptual Framework

The concept map of fig. 1 represents a simplified view of our ecosystem in which the indicator
concept co-exists with the methods adopted to produce the indicator, as well as with the data
sets underpinning it. Therefore, within the proposed model, an indicator i is an extensible tuple
composed of the following sets of concepts:
(a) A profile (Pi ) composed of a number of characterizations and user-level annotations. While
the characterizations define classifications on the base of open vocabularies and the association of i with virtual structures (e.g. layers), the user-level descriptors specify user-level
descriptions and metadata, commonly expressed in a natural language.
(b) The structure (Si ) provides a set of indicator types. We distinguish among the common application-level indicator, supporting indicator and structured indicators. Unlike the
application-level indicator, a supporting indicator is not normally used directly at an application level but it is defined to support the definition or the computation of other indicators.
Structured indicators include the composite indicator and the subindicator : as the names
suggest, the composite indicator is composed of sub-indicators. The type of an indicator can be specified according to many different perspective. By relating the indicators
at a structural level, Si facilitates knowledge inference, as well as the implementation of
high-level mechanisms (e.g browsing, searching, discovering).

Figure 1: Conceptual Framework.
(c) A non-empty data set (Di ) underpinning i. Depending on the context,Di can be either the
data set used to compute the values of i or the values of i themselves.
(d) At least one computation method (Mi ) providing a function valuei reflecting the formula
or the process to compute the values of i from Di . If Di represents the values of i, then
valuesi is a simple relation of equivalence among sets.
Our model provides an intelligible perspective at the indicator ecosystem which is very
close to the human common understanding of it. That is intrinsically extensible, meaning the
cardinality of the tuple may be further increased or enriched to address additional representation
requirements or features.

3.2

Indicator Ontology

We have implemented the conceptual framework as an OWL-DL ontology [8]. In order to simplify the description and the understanding of the data structure, as well as to facilitate its
usability, we have partitioned the ontology in five sub-ontologies (groups of classes and properties) as the function of the scope within the model: Indicator, Data, Profiling, Computations
and Geographic Context. In addition, those semantic structures are integrated with a number
of generic-purpose annotation properties to provide the typical user-level annotations (such
as descriptions in a natural language and labels), extended metadata (e.g. the publisher, the

related to the geographic areas).
The Geographic Context includes those concepts and properties needed to define the geographic space. The current implementation adopts a straightforward approach which assumes
the different geographic areas uniquely identified by an ID withing the geographic model they
are associated with (fig. 2). Generally speaking, a crucial aspect for the data aggregation is the
mapping of our semantic representation with external assets, including data and computational
resources. As an example, the concept map in fig. 3 shows the mapping between a DataType and
a relational database. Such a mapping provides the semantic representation (DataType) of the
physical data. The main classes, ordered by groups, are reported in table 1, as well as the main
properties are listed in table 2. An exhaustive description of the ontology implementations
and its use in practice is out of the scope of the paper.

3.3

Reference Architecture

An abstracted representation of the reference architecture which enables in fact our ontological
support is shown in fig. 4. It is ideally structured into four functional layers (Data, Middleware,
Semantic, CORE and Application) aimed at establishing a semantic ecosystem from distributed
data environments scattered on the cloud. This implies the need for dynamic data retrieval,
aggregation and processing mechanisms. Our architectural approach prioritizes:

• Semantics on a large scale. It implies the accurate design of all the structural components
which could propose significant trade-off between capability and performance. We apply
a simple but effective logic: load only what is needed, when you it is needed. We will deal
with the evaluation of our technological environment in a separate paper.
• Semantic data aggregation. It is the mechanism that enables the whole ecosystem in fact.
A middleware layer that assures the use of a sophisticated semantics in a secure and
reliable context is the real key factor for a successful application.
• Dynamic access to external computational resources. In order to assure a dynamic environment, our computation engine assumes the pervasive access to external computational
resources and services. As for data, the performance of such mechanisms have a huge
impact on the whole architecture.

Uncertainty and Open Issues

Our presentation of this work suggests a deterministic data ecosystem, namely the application
of formal semantics to systematically and unambiguously specify the key concepts and critical
relations associated with the urban indicator domain. However, despite the semantic support

Table 2: Main properties in the ontological framework.

provided, uncertainty remains a major issue that requires specific attention to ensure reliable
solutions. In applying the proposed ontology and dynamic data retrieval approach to the urban
indicator domain, we have identified a number of significant causes of uncertainty, as follows:
”Bad” Data The philosophy behind open data is that data should be freely available to
everyone to use as they wish without restrictions. Open Data is definitely a huge opportunity
for a wide set of domains, from science to politics, especially when considered in a context of
enhanced interoperability [9]. On the other hand, open data is also a risk, especially because
the quality and the accuracy of the data cannot be always guaranteed. It applies to most open
environments (e.g. Semantic Sensor Web [10]). Within this context, raw data play a critical role
with regard to potentially generating uncertainties. Most publishers of indicators, only rely on
a reduced number of reputable data sources (e.g. Government Agencies). This limits potential
indicators to a small number of well-known official indicators. Other systems simply assume
all data is reliable, and make no attempt to assess accuracy and reputability. Quantifying
uncertainty and its propagation (e.g., in indicators derived by others) is complex and requires,
apart from extensive semantics, specific mechanisms for analysis and risk assessment (e.g.[11]).
Concerning our semantic framework, we reduce significantly the uncertainty and push a
completely open data philosophy (i) by providing formal relations between the indicators and
the data underpinning them and (ii) by including descriptors for data providers, meaning the
reliability of a given data set is associated mostly with the reputation of the provider. Thus,
8

assuming the formal relation between the indicators and the data underpinning them, the
data providers can be grouped and ranked according to their category. For example, the data
provided by a government agency would be considered more reliable than the data retrieved by
using Google APIs. The main advantage of this approach is that reliability is understood as an
open concept, meaning there are no restrictions on the way in which that trust is estimated or
evaluated; on the other hand, establishing largely accepted criteria, different from the generic
obvious ones, to measure trust could be very unrealistic.
Similarity and Approximation The semantic equivalences among different indicators can
be supported via upper-level domain vocabularies. However, complex cross-disciplinary environments are likely to require more complex semantic relationships, such as different indicators
which are not completely equivalent in terms of semantics but merely similar in a given context
(similarity). Establishing high-level semantic relations among indicators is one of the key feature for the evolution of the current platforms and environments; although such relations may
introduce uncertainties. An example of relation which does not introduce uncertainties in the
system is the similarity among indicators which have the same scope and, although produced in
a different way from different data sets, have a similar ”meaning” in a given context. At least in
theory, there is no uncertainty as the similarity is recognized and formally defined at a semantic level. A different situation is the use of the similarity relation as an approximation of the
target semantic. For instance, in the analysis of transportation systems, the average distance
commuted to get an area a from an area b is often approximated by the distance between the
centroids of the two areas. Depending on the context of the analysis, that approximation may
be absolutely reasonable, as well as completely wrong, along a wide range of middle cases. If
such approximation is not properly modelled and computed inside the ecosystem, the resulting
uncertainty can be systematically propagated in the system producing results which can be
inaccurate in the best case, completely wrong in the worst. Therefore, an indicator should
be described and formally specified according to its real semantic and eventual similarities
or approximations need a specific representation and processing. Depending on the relations
considered and the application context, this kind of uncertainty can be modeled according to
generic quantitative models (e.g. Probabilistic Semantics [12]) or by applying concept-specific
frameworks (e.g. the Web of Similarity [13]).
Lacks in data sets The lack of relevant data to calculate indicators often leads to the use
of next best data available. That establishes a kind of best-effort environment that relies on
assumptions and approximations that are not properly modeled at a semantic level. This
scenario intrinsically pushes uncertainties which are very similar to the ones discussed in the
previous point. Any assumptions or approximations that underpin a given indicator, as well
as the resulting uncertainties, should be modeled and taken into consideration throughout the
production process and, of course, at an application level.

Conclusions

Addressing the next generation of urban indicators in an open technological context is an
exciting objective which presents multiple convergent research issues. Indeed, while on one
hand the use of rich semantics operating on a large scale enables in fact the target ecosystem,
on the other hand it proposes significant challenges in terms of performance and management
of the uncertainty.

An ontological approach to Salvatore
Urban Indicators

This paper has mainly focused on the latter aspect: through an integrated semantic structure, which formally relates the high-level specification of the indicators with the methods to
produce those indicators as well as with the data sets underpinning them, the uncertainty is
easier to be identified and properly treated. However, a comprehensive representation and processing of the uncertainty in the indicator domain seems to be beyond the capabilities of the
current Semantic Web technology. Our future work in this area will explore the application of
novel approaches to model the uncertainty in the Semantic Web (e.g. [13]), as well as more
sophisticated techniques to dynamically define and compose indicators from registered data
sets through semantic inference. Moreover, we aims at the evaluation of the performance of our
framework on a relatively large scale.
