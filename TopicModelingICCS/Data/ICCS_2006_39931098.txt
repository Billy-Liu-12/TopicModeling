Abstract. We present new algorithm for growth of non-clustered planar
graphs by aggregation of cells with given distribution of size and constraint of connectivity k = 3 per node. The emergent graph structures
are controlled by two parameters—chemical potential of the cell aggregation and the width of the cell size distribution. We compute several
statistical properties of these graphs—fractal dimension of the perimeter, distribution of shortest paths between pairs of nodes and topological
betweenness of nodes and links. We show how these topological properties depend on the control parameters of the aggregation process and
discuss their relevance for the conduction of current in self-assembled
nanopatterns.

Introduction

In recent years increased interests in various networks realizations [1, 2] revealed
that several new types of graphs termed structured graphs are more appropriate
mathematical objects to describe complex network’s geometry than traditional
random graphs [3]. The variety of structures was found to emerge through evolution processes in which nodes and links are added sequentially according to
speciﬁed rules, in particular, the preferential attachment rules lead to strongly
inhomogeneous scale-free graphs [1]. In contrast to the evolving networks, which
comprise a class of causal graphs, the class of homogeneous graphs consists of
graphs with ﬁxed number of nodes and ﬂuctuating or rewiring links according
to given rules or certain optimization processes. Complex graph structures may
emerge in this procedures, especially when certain global or local optimization
constraints are imposed [4].
Planar graphs are special class of graphs that can be embedded in a Euclidean
plane. A graph is planar iﬀ it does not contain a subdivision of K5 (5-clique) and
K3,3 (minimal non-planar graph with 6 nodes) [3]. Consequently, planar graphs
fulﬁll Euler’s law: Np + N = E + 1, which is relating the number of nodes N ,
links E and polygons Np .
In this work we suggest a new method for growing a planar cellular graph by
attachment of objects—cells (polygons) of length np , which are chosen from a
given distribution f (np ). The polygons are added sequentially in time starting
from an initial polygon. In addition, we strictly impose the constraint on number

of links per node k = 3, which is thus fulﬁlled everywhere in the interior of the
graph and on some nodes on the graph boundary. The attachment of cells is
controlled by two parameters—the width of the distribution of cell sizes μ2 and
the parameter ν that plays the role of chemical potential of cell aggregation. In
the limit of vanishing attachment potential ν → 0 the growth process resembles
the one in diﬀusion-limited aggregation [6]. However, aggregated are spatially
extended cells of particles rather than single particles.
Emergent structures of cellular networks are resembling of soap froths [7] or
patterns of nano-particles self-assembled through nonlinear dynamic processes
[8, 9]. Typically, a pattern of cells appears when nano-particles are immersed in
a liquid ﬁlm, which is then allowed to evaporate until holes of diﬀerent sizes
open-up leaving particles in the walls between the holes [9, 10]. Generally, the
structure of the patterns eﬀects the physical processes on them, such as current
transport [11]. It is therefore important to understand the topology of the aggregated cellular networks in detail. Here we study the topological properties,
such as shortest paths between nodes, topological centrality, and fractality of the
graph’s perimeter in diﬀerent cellular networks obtained by varying the control
parameters of the aggregation processes.

Cell Aggregation

The basic idea is to make growing model of planar graph with given distribution
of cell (polygon) sizes f (np ) and with degree of nodes 2 ≤ k ≤ 3.
2.1

Topological Constraint

For this purpose we observe some topological constraints on the distribution
of cell sizes: (i) f (np ) is deﬁned for np ≥ 3, for non-clustered graph we ﬁx
f (3) = 0; (ii) planar graph obeys Euler’s law: Np + N = E + 1. Among these the
homogeneous plane-ﬁlling structures are of special interest [7]. For this class of
graphs majority of nodes are in the interior of the graph, ie., nodes with degree
k = 3. Therefor 3N ≈ 2E and Euler’s law becomes
6Np = 2E + 6.

Model

Starting from an initial cell, at each time step a new cell with size taken from
the distribution f (np ) is attached to the graph boundary of the graph according
to the following rules:
1. In the aggregation only nodes with degree 3 can be closed inside the graph;
2. New link can be assigned only to nodes with degree 2;
3. Potential nesting place is searched as an array of nodes on graph boundary
with degree 3 limited with two nodes of degree 2. The nested part of the cell
is identiﬁed with the nodes of the nesting string. Therefore, number of extra
nodes to be added is n = np − l, where l is length of the nesting string. We
select the nesting place with probability p ∼ e−νn , where the parameter ν
plays the role of the chemical potential for addition of new nodes.

We implemented this algorithm in C++ according to following steps:
Initial graph: one polygon of size np taken from f(np)
For i=2 to Np
np = next random from distribution f(np)
If(there is no nodes on graph boundary with degree 2) exit(1)
For all j=(periphery node with degree 2)
d=distance to the next node on graph boundary with degree 2
Number of new nodes n = np-d-1
If(n>0) p(j)=exp(-nu*n)
End of loop j
If(there is no j with n>0) exit(2)
Normalize p(j)
j = next random from distribution p(j)
Add new polygon with size np linked with
node j and next node on graph boundary with degree 2
End of loop i
exit(0)
Depending on model parameters of the growth process and it stochasticity
three possible exit cases are:
– exit(0) - Open structure (planar graph with Np polygons);
– exit(1) - Closed structure (after some number of step there are no more nodes
of degree 2 and structure stops to grow, no nesting places of any size);
– exit(2) - No nesting place available for current cell. In this case one can take
next cell, which in turn perturbs the actual distribution.
We never experienced the exit(2) situation for the range of parameters μ2 ∈
[0.5, 2.0], ν ∈ [0, 5] and Np = 1000 in huge number of samples. Two examples of
the emergent open and closed structures are shown on Fig. 1. More examples of
cellular networks are shown in Fig. 2 for varying parameters μ2 and ν.

Fractal Dimension of Network Perimeter

During the nesting growing process in one step number of nodes N increases
by n < np . Number of added nodes n at each step depends on the cell size and
length of the nesting string. Therefore, N ≈ κNp where κ = n is average growth
rate. For open structures (see Fig. 1-2) boundary of the graph becomes fractal,
depending on the control parameters. In fact, length of the graph boundary L
grows as a power of the number of cells Np (or network size N ) with fractal
dimension D deﬁned by L ∼ NpD .
In Fig. 3 we show how number of nodes on the graph boundary increases with
Np . Each point is averaged over 10 emergent growing networks. The dimension
D is in the range 12 ≤ D ≤ 1, when D = 1 correspond to structures of high
fractality, that is obtained for small values of the parameter ν. D = 12 correspond
to planar ”circle like” structures with reduced fractality. For μ2 > 0 we observe a

in structures with homogeneous cell distribution (μ2 = 0 - hexagons only) a
sharp transition seems to occur at νc ≈ 1.5.

Shortest Paths and Centrality on Cellular Networks

In this section we consider global topological properties of the cell-aggregated
planar graphs and their dependence on the control parameters μ2 and ν.

Shortest Paths

Shortest path between two nodes is deﬁned as path along the smallest number of
intermediate links [3]. We implemented an algorithm for counting shortest paths
of Dijksta type [12]. In Fig. 4 we show distribution of lengths of shortest paths
between all pairs of nodes on network. All networks are for ﬁxed μ2 = 1.0 and
approximately of the same size N ≈ 1000 nodes. Each point in Fig. 4 is averaged
over 100 sample networks. We found similar results for other μ2 values.

Solid line: Gaussian with l0 = 23 and σ = 8.37.

All these networks have similar topology at local level, because the number of
links at all interior nodes is constant k = 3. Therefore, distributions of shortest
distances at small scale are similar for all values of parameter ν. Diﬀerences in
global topology appear on large scale for lengths larger then peak value l0 ∼ 25,
which manifest in occurrence of additional peaks (see Fig. 4). The probability
of long paths increases for larger values of the parameter ν. Whereas in the
limit ν = 0 the distribution of length of shortest paths on large scale can be
approximated with a normal distribution (inset on Fig. 4).

analogous way. In our algorithm, we record number of shortest paths through
each node and through each link on a network. In Fig. 5 we show distributions
of betweenness of nodes and links averaged over 100 sample networks with ﬁxed
μ2 = 1.0 and size N ≈ 1000 nodes. For inhomogeneous networks, distributions
of these two betweenness measures can be substantially diﬀerent. In our case,
however, they are similar because all interior nodes have ﬁxed degree k = 3.
We ﬁnd that distributions at small scale strongly depend on parameter ν, which
results from the graph boundary. Similar conclusions hold for other μ2 values.
In Fig. 2 thick lines represent links with large betweenness. For this type of
networks the strongest lines, which make the skeleton of the graph, are connecting the nodes with largest centrality measure.

Conclusions

We have introduced a new algorithm for growth of graphs by aggregation process
of extended objects - polygons with size distribution. Depending on aggregation
conditions, which are determined by two parameters controlling the distribution width and attachment potential, we can get a wide spectrum of emergent
structures. In this paper we presented some results for the case of lognormal
distribution of cells and additional constraints, leading to the emergent nonclustered planar graphs with a constant node connectivity. The algorithm works
for variety of cell distributions and constraints, that may result in diverse opened
(fractal) or closed structures. For instance, for a special set of parameters we can
get closed structures of C60 type.
We measured several topological properties of these networks in quantitative details—fractality of the graph boundary, shortest paths, and betweenness

centrality. This properties are important for some dynamical process on networks
such as electrical conductivity [11] via single electron tunneling [9, 14].
