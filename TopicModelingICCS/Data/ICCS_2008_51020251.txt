Abstract. A stationary hot gas jet supersonically expanding into a
low pressure environment is studied through multi-scale numerical
simulations.
A hybrid continuum-molecular approach is used to model the ﬂow.
Due to the low pressure and high thermodynamic gradients, the accuracy of continuum mechanics results are doubtful, while, because of its
excessive time expenses, a full molecular method is not feasible. The results of the proposed hybrid continuum-molecular approach have been
successfully validated against experimental data.
An important question for the full understanding of the processes governing the ﬂow is addressed: the demonstration of an invasion of the supersonic part of the ﬂow by background particles. Through the tracking
of particles and collisions in the supersonic region it could be deﬁnitively
proven that background particles are present in this region. We present a
complete two dimensional picture of how the invading background particles distribute and collide with local particles into the supersonic region.

Introduction

The necessity to model a hot gas jet supersonically expanding in a low pressure
environment is present in several gas ﬂuidic applications of current importance;
gas thruster nozzles and plume ﬂows [1] and processes of thin ﬁlm deposition
from expanding plasma or gas jets [2] are some examples.
The gas in the jet is generally at relatively high pressure, and then it rapidly
expands into a low pressure environment. For this reason, the gas ﬁrst supersonically expands and then quickly compresses through a stationary shock wave

(Mach disk). In addition, the expansion zone is surrounded by a barrel shaped
shock (barrel shock) (Fig. 1).
Although several studies have been devoted to supersonic expansion of gas
jets in a low pressure environment [3,4,5,6], full understanding of the processes
governing the ﬂow has not been reached yet. In particular, it is still not completely clear whether, due to rarefaction eﬀects, the barrel shock still protects
the supersonic part of the ﬂow from the invasion of background molecules, i.e.
molecules that are present outside the expansion-shock region [3]. Invading the
supersonic part of the jet, these background molecules could, therefore, inﬂuence
its properties. Already Fenn and Anderson in 1966 [7] and Campargue in 1970
[8] predicted this phenomenon, but a full understanding of it has not yet been
reached.
In the current paper the important issue of the presence of background particles in the supersonic region will be addressed. This issue will be studied through
the tracking of particles and collisions in the supersonic region.
It has been shown [5] that, because of rarefaction eﬀects, the Navier-Stokes
equations are not adequate for the description of this problem, and therefore, the
continuum CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) approach fails in predicting the
ﬂow ﬁeld in the expansion-shock region. A kinetic simulation model should be applied to correctly study the ﬂow. For this reason, in the past, DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) has been used [5]. However, because DSMC computational
expenses scale with Kn−4 , it was impossible to fulﬁll the DSMC requirements
with respect to the size of gridcells and timesteps, expecially near the inlet, where
the Knudsen number is quite low [5].
In order to overcome this problem, one needs to construct a model that on the
one hand accounts for the molecular nature of the gas ﬂow where needed, and on
the other hand uses a continuum model where allowed. In the past years several
hybrid continuum/molecular models have been proposed [9,10,11,12,13,14].
The present hybrid method has been presented in [12,13] and validated in [14].
The method applies the continuum approach in the wide continuum region in
order to save computational time and to get numerical simulations of the ﬂow,
pressure and temperature of the expanding jet at large scales. DSMC is only
applied in the expansion-shock region where it is necessary in order to correctly
model the rareﬁed nature of the ﬂow and to show how the invading background
particles distribute and collide with local particles into the supersonic region.
Whereas in [14] we focused on the validation of 1-dimensional temperature
and velocity proﬁles along the axis against experimental data from [3], in the
present paper we will present 2-dimensional velocity ﬁelds which will be compared to experimental data from [6].

Studied Conﬁguration and Measurement Technique

In order to have an experimental support to our conclusions, all our numerical
results have been validated by comparing them to experimental measurements
by Engeln et al. [3], Vankan et al. [4] and Gabriel et al. [6].

The measurements described in [3,4,6] were performed on an expanding thermal plasma jet. Nevertheless, because of the low ionization degree, they can be
used to validate our present results on a neutral gas ﬂow, neglecting the presence
of electrons and ions [3] and the eﬀects of ionization and recombination on the
ﬂow ﬁeld [3,15].
The experimental set-up in which the expanding thermal plasma jet is created
has been extensively described in [16] and it is schematically depicted in Fig. 1.
Two techniques, the Thomson-Rayleigh and the laser induced ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy (LIF), have been used to study the ﬂow. The latter provided detailed, 2-dimensional information on the velocity ﬁeld. A description of the two
techniques is given in [3,4].

Numerical Simulation Method

The present method has been described in detail in [12,13] and validated in [14],
here only a short description will be given.
In order to properly characterize the various regimes in the gas ﬂow, the
Knudsen number Kn is deﬁned as the ratio between the mean free path and a
relevant macroscopic length scale. When Knudsen is low (Kn < 0.01), the gas
may be treated as a continuum and the gas ﬂow modelled using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). When Knudsen is high (Kn > 10), the gas behavior
is molecular and may be modelled using Molecular Dynamics techniques. In the
intermediate regime, the DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) approach is
the most commonly used simulation technique. However, its computational expenses scale with Kn−4 and it becomes very time demanding as Kn becomes
lower than ∼ 0.05.
In order to overcome this dilemma and solve the ﬂow throughout the expanding gas jet, we use a hybrid CFD/DSMC model, which takes into account the
molecular nature of the gas ﬂow where needed, and uses a continuum model
where allowed.
The continuum breakdown parameter Knmax [18] is employed in the present
study as a criterion for selecting the proper solver. If the calculated value of
the continuum breakdown parameter in a region is larger than a limiting value
Knsplit , then that region cannot be accurately modelled using the N-S equations,
and DSMC has to be used. For Knsplit a value of 0.05 was used. The method has
been found to be rather insensitive to the precise CFD/DSMC interface location
w.r.t. Knsplit [12].
The CFD code used is a 2-D, unsteady code based on a ﬁnite volume formulation in compressible form. It uses an explicit, second-order, ﬂux-splitting,
MUSCL scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations.
The 2-D DSMC code developed is based on the algorithm described in [17]. A
”particle reservoirs” approach was used to implement the inlet (outlet) boundary conditions. Molecules were generated in those reservoirs with a ChapmannEnskog velocity distributions.

Schwarz Coupling

The multi-scale hybrid coupling approach used is based on the overlapped Schwarz
method with Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary conditions [10] and it consists of two
stages.
The ﬁrst stage is a prediction stage, where the unsteady N-S equations are
integrated in time until steady state on the entire domain. From this steady
state solution, the continuum breakdown parameter Knmax is computed and its
values are used to split the domain in the subdomains, where the ﬂow ﬁeld will
be evaluated respectively using DSMC and the N-S solver. Between the DSMC
and CFD regions an overlap region is considered, where the ﬂow is computed
with both the DSMC and the CFD solver.
In the second stage, DSMC and CFD are run in their respective subdomains
with their own time steps until steady state. The boundary conditions to the
DSMC region come from the solution in the CFD region and are imposed by
a ”particle reservoir” approach, whereas the boundary conditions to the CFD
region come from the solution in the DSMC region, averaged over the CFD cells.
Once a steady state solution has been obtained in both the DSMC and N-S
regions, the continuum breakdown parameter Knmax is re-evaluated and a new
boundary between the two regions is computed. This second stage is iterated
until the relative diﬀerence (in pressure, velocity and temperature) between the
DSMC and CFD solutions in the overlapping region is less than a prescribed
value.
The advantage of using a Schwarz method with Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary
conditions, instead of the more common ﬂux-based coupling technique [11], is
that, the latter requires a much higher number of samples than the Schwarz
method [11]. In fact, the DSMC statistical scatter involved in determining the
ﬂuxes is much higher than that associated with the macroscopic state variables.
3.2

Modelled Geometry

The computational domain (Fig. 1) is a d = 32 cm diameter cylinder of length
L = 50 cm. From a circular hole of diameter din = 8 mm, on its top, a ﬂow
of 56 sccs of argon is injected at a temperature Tin = 8000 K. The top and
lateral walls are at a temperature Tw = 400 K, while the bottom wall is at a
temperature Tsub = 600 K. The pumping exit, which in reality is a circular hole,
in our 2-D model has been represented as a lout = 2 cm wide ring on the bottom
of the cylinder at a distance of Rout = 12 cm from the axis. A pressure Pout = 20
P a in the exit has been considered, since for this outlet pressure a large amount
of experimental data is available [3,6].
Inside the chamber we suppose the ﬂow to be 2-D axi-symmetric. The continuum grid is composed of 100 cells in the radial direction and 200 cells in the
axial direction. Grid independence has been tested by doubling the continuum
grid in each of the two directions, leading to variations in the solution below 3%.
The code automatically reﬁnes the mesh in the DSMC region to fullﬁll its requirements. The number of simulated particle in the DSMC region is N ≈ 8·105 .

Results
General Flow Field Characteristics

In Fig. 2 the number density (a) and pressure (b) proﬁles along the z-axis in the
expansion-shock region, as evaluated by the hybrid approach at 20 P a chamber
pressure, are shown. It is well known [19] that, in the expansion, the density
decreases quadratically with the distance z to the inlet (1/z 2 ), whereas the
pressure has a 1/z 2γ dependence, where γ is the gas constant (for argon γ =
1.67). In Fig. 2(a), the number density proﬁles measured with the ThomsonRayleigh technique by Vankan et al. at 40 and 10 P a chamber pressures are also
presented. Even if no density measurements were available at 20 P a chamber
pressure, the present hybrid results are exactly between the experimental data
at 40 and 10 P a chamber pressures measured by Vankan et al. [4].
Fig. 3(a) shows the division between the DSMC, continuum and overlapping
regions in our hybrid method. In Fig. 3(b)-(e) a comparison between experimental data from [6], results from the present hybrid method, results from full DSMC
simulations performed by Selezneva et al. [5], and results from present continuum
simulations for the 2-dimensional velocity ﬁeld in the expansion-shock region is
presented. The velocity contours in Fig. 3(b) are the result of an interpolation
of measured velocities at various positions in the expansion-shock region [6]. It
is clear that the hybrid method predicts the experimental data better than the

other approaches. The reason why the hybrid approach predicts experimental
data even better than the full DSMC simulations is that, as discussed in section
1 and as already highlighted by Selezneva et al. [5], in the full DSMC simulations
it was not possible to respect DSMC requirements in the near inlet region and
a too coarse mesh had to be used.
If we ﬁrst compare the experimental data from [6] (Fig. 3(b)) to the results
of the full CFD approach (Fig. 3(e)), the velocity predicted by the continuum
approach in the expansion-shock region is signiﬁcantly (200 − 500 m/s) lower
than the experimental one. Because of rarefaction, in fact, upstream of the shock
the expansion is stronger, reaching higher velocity values.
If we compare the experimental data from [6] (Fig. 3(b)) to the full DSMC
simulations by Selezneva et al. [5] (Fig. 3(d)), we can notice that the DSMC predicts correct velocity values in the expansion, but the maximum velocity along
the z-axis is moved ∼ 1 cm upstream with respect to the experimental data.
Finally, hybrid simulations (Fig. 3(c)) result in a very good agreement with
the experiments (Fig. 3(b)); The hybrid approach, in fact, was able to predict
the correct velocity values and the right position for the velocity peak in the
expansion.
4.2

Invasion of the Expansion-Shock Region

In this section we want to demonstrate the invasion of background particles into
the expansion-shock region. In continuum conditions, because of the presence
of the shock, these particles would not be able to enter the supersonic region.
However, we will show that, because of the rarefaction eﬀects, the shock becomes
transparent and does not protect the supersonic region. Therefore some particles
may actually move into it from the subsonic part of the ﬂow. To demonstrate
this hypothesis, it is necessary to know the origin of the particles present in
the supersonic region. For this reason, for the particles in the DSMC region,
two diﬀerent labels were used; one for the particles which, after entering the
reactor chamber, have always been in the supersonic region (the so called ”inlet
particles”), and a diﬀerent one for the background particles.

expansion-shock region at 20 P a chamber pressure. Experimental data from [6] (b),
present hybrid simulations (c), DSMC data from [5] (d), present continuum simulations (e).

In Fig. 4 we compare the axial velocity distribution of our simulation at r = 0
and z = 59 mm (a) and the radial velocity distribution of our simulation at
r = 22 mm and z = 50 mm (b) to the ones measured by Engeln et al. It is clear
that there is a very good agreement between our current hybrid simulations and
the experiments from [3].
In Fig. 4 we also show the contribution of the background particles and the
inlet particles to the axial velocity distribution, at the position r = 0 and z = 59
mm (a), and to the radial velocity distribution at the position r = 22 mm and
z = 50 mm (b). The presence of background particles in the supersonic region
is evident. The peaks of the two contributions to the radial velocity distribution
(Fig. 4(b)) are located on opposite sides of the zero velocity position, meaning
that particles coming from the inlet are moving away from the axis because of the
expansion, whereas background particles are penetrating into the supersonic region and moving toward the axis. Once the background particles have penetrated
the supersonic region, they start colliding and interacting with the particles that
are already there, decelerating them and being accelerated by them.
In order to further prove the hypothesis of the presence of background particles in the supersonic region and explain how they collide and interact with
the local particles, a study was performed, at the molecular scale, by tracking
particles and collisions in the supersonic region. The results of this study are
presented in Fig. 5.
The background particles concentration in Fig. 5(a) further proves their presence in the supersonic region.

and average number of times that inlet particles have collided with background particles
before reaching the given location (b).

In the expansion region, the velocity increases, reaching a maximum value
on the axis at a distance z = 3 cm from the inlet (Fig. 3), whereas density
and pressure decrease reaching a minimum (Fig. 2) at the same location. The
invading background particles are driven into the region of minimum pressure
by favorable pressure gradients. For the same reason, once they are there, it is
diﬃcult for them to cross the Mach disk because of the adverse pressure gradient. Therefore, the invading background particles concentrate in the region of
minimum pressure, reaching values of up 25% of the total number of particles.
Finally, Fig. 5(b) presents the average number of collisions with background
particles that an inlet particle has undergone before reaching its position. As
expected, the number of collisions increases along the z axis and it reaches the
maximum value of ∼ 1.8 collisions. This is of course an averaged value, meaning
that there are inlet particles which did not collide as well as inlet particles that
have collided much more than 1.8 times with background particles. This clearly

Multi-scale Modelling of the Two-Dimensional Flow Dynamics

demonstrates that the inlet particles do interact with the background particles
that invaded the supersonic region.
Engeln et al. in [3] and Gabriel et al. in [6] also found experimental indications
for the presence of background particles in the expansion-shock region. Therefore, our study gives a numerical support to the hypothesis of Engeln et al. and
Gabriel et al. that background particles can penetrate the supersonic region and,
by interacting with the inlet particles, can inﬂuence the ﬂow ﬁeld.

Conclusions

The gas dynamics of a hot gas jet supersonically expanding into a low pressure
environment is studied by means of a multi-scale hybrid coupled continuumDSMC method. This method gives the possibility to save computational time
using CFD in most of the domain and to use DSMC only where it is necessary
in order to correctly model the ﬂow.
The answer to an important question about supersonic expansion in a low
pressure environment has been found: the invasion of the supersonic region by
background particles. By tracking particles and collisions in the supersonic region, we have demonstrated the presence of background particles in this region,
thus proving the invasion of the supersonic region by background particles and
describing how they can inﬂuence the ﬂow ﬁeld by colliding and interacting with
the local particles.
