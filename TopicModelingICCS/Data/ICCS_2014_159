Abstract
With the advanced field observation, image and drilling technology, geological structure of reservoirs
can be described in more details. A novel 3D mesh generation method for geological reservoir models
is proposed and implemented with arbitrary stratigraphical surface constraints , which ensures the
detailed geological structure and material properties are well described and analysed. Specifically, the
stratigraphic interfaces are firstly ext racted and meshed, and then the tetrahedron mesh is generated
with the constraints of the meshed surfaces. The proposed approach includes the following five steps:
(1) extract ing stratum interfaces; (2) creat ing a background mesh with size field on the interfaces; (3)
constructing geodesic isolines fro m the interface boundaries to the interior; (4) emp loying a geodesicbased approach to create triangles on the area between adjacent isolines and to combine them together;
(5) generating tetrahedron mesh for 3D reservoirs with constraints of the above surface triangular
mesh. Th is approach has been implemented and applied to the Lawn Hill reservoir model to
demonstrate its effectiveness and usefulness.
Keywords: Mesh generation, 3D reservoir, Stratigraphy, surface constraint.

1 Introduction
With the advanced field observation, imaging and drilling technology, geological structure of
reservoirs can be described in mo re details. Three dimensional (3D) dig ital images in vo xel format are
not only prevalent in med icine science such as CT/MRI, but also widely adopted in geological science
and min ing industry (Jones and others 2009; Tonini and others 2009). Geolog ical software such as
Go CAD (http://www.gocad.org) and Geo modeller (http://www.geo modeller.co m) utilize vo xels to
achieve geological modelling fo r reservoirs with co mplicated geodesic co mponents. Although it is
possible to automatically establish co mplex models in the format of vo xels, the basin analysis may be

difficult to achieve due to the huge amount of grids wh ich are out of capability of exiting co mputer
hardware. . Therefore, unstructured mesh (Gorman and others 2008; Wu and Xu 2003) with
appropriate element quality are used and analyzed by using fin ite element method (Guldberg and
others 1998; Xing and others 2007; Zhang and others 2005). Ho w to generate proper tetrahedron
meshes to describe geological reservoir models accurately with reasonable mesh numbers is still a
quite challenging topic and will be addressed in this paper.

1.1 3D Digital Image Mesh Generation
Geological reservoir models can be well described by using multi-material d igital images in
various different data format, such as the widely applied vo xel format. Mesh generation for such
mu lti-material images is still quite challenging especially concerning the geometrical constraints such
as material interfaces, interface junctions and corners. The related mesh generation attracts numerous
researchers to work on it (Boltcheva and others 2009; Lederman and others 2011; Lo rensen and Cline
1987; Wu and Sullivan 2003; Zhang and others 2010).
Most of the existing approaches (Bo ltcheva and others 2009; Lederman and others 2011; Zhang
and others 2010) create tetrahedron/hexahedron mesh fro m 3D mult i-material image directly and then
refine the material interfaces. Boltcheva et al. (Bo ltcheva and others 2009) proposed a Delaunay-based
mesh generation to preserve material features and constrain boundaries, which relies on sampling
corners and edges fro m the input image. However, this method fails when thin material exists or angle
of boundary corners is too sharp. Zhang et al. (Zhang and others 2010) developed an octree-based
isocontouring method with a material change edge analysing to mesh mult i-material image. Due to the
inherent drawback of octree-based method, elements around constraints could not maintain a good
shape and quality as required. Lederman et al. (Lederman and others 2011) employed a grid-based
approach to generate initial tetrahedral mesh, and then performed mesh improvement on related
material interfaces. The drawback is that it will generate an enormous number of additional elements
and nodes. Different fro m the above methods, the approach proposed by Wu et al. (Wu and Sullivan
2003) focuses on the material interfaces. It extends the matching cubes method (Lorensen and Cline
1987) to address multi-material mesh generation. However, the generated surface mesh has a large
number of elements, which will lead to a huge volume element quantity. As regards the volume mesh
generation, it depends on the input surface mesh. Hence, it is crucial to develop an appropriate surface
remeshing approach for the multi-material meshing.

1.2 Surface Remeshing
Initial surface meshes extracted fro m geological reservoir models have both complicated structures
and constraints. Because of the inherent of image data, the direct ly generated meshes are jagged.
Therefore, it is difficult to parameterize these surfaces into a 2D do main and perform appropriate
remeshing approaches as what researchers conventionally did (Kraevoy and Sheffer 2004; Schreiner
and others 2004).
Nu merous literatures (Alliez and others 2003; Alliez and others 2002; Alliez and others 2008;
Eldar and others 1997; Lee and others 1999; Lin and others 2003; Peyr√© and Cohen 2004; Peyr√© and
Cohen 2006; Praun and others 2001; Sifri and others 2003; Surazhsky and others 2003) have been
proposed in the field of surface remeshing. A group of remeshing approaches (Lee and others 1999;
Lin and others 2003; Praun and others 2001) split mesh into matching patches with identical
connectivity boundaries, and then parameterize these patches into planar domain respectively.
Although interface boundaries in mult i-material images could be used as connectivity, it is hard to
achieve a well parameterizat ion without distortion due to the complexity structure and jagged feature.
Another group of remeshing methods is achieved by sampling technologies on parameterized domain
(Alliez and others 2003; Alliez and others 2002; Eldar and others 1997; Surazhsky and others 2003).
Eldar et al. (Eldar and others 1997) y ielded a Voronoi-based scheme through iteratively inserting a

898

sample point as far as possible fro m current placed ones. Alliez et al. (Alliez and others 2002)
proposed an interactive remeshing approach, which allows the user to control the sampling density
over the surface patch using a so-called control map. However, all the above sampling approaches still
have problems due to d istorted parameterization do main caused by the complicated geometrical shape
and jagged feature. Recently, geodesic-based remeshing with fast matching method (Kimmel and
Sethian 1998) attracts the interest of researchers (Peyr√© and Cohen 2004; Peyr√© and Cohen 2006; Sifri
and others 2003). One advantage of geodesic-based remeshing is to imp lement on surface mesh
directly without parameterization. Peyr√© and Cohen (Peyr√© and Cohen 2006) advocated a geodesic
remeshing using a front propagation. Nevertheless, it does not take into account boundary constraints.
Peyr√© and Cohen (Peyr√© and Cohen 2004) and Sifri et al. (Sifri and others 2003) emp loyed geodesic
distance to partition the problem do main but with individual point as start rather than boundary lines,
and thus their methods are not suitable for mult i-material images with comp licated boundary
constraints. In summary, although the geodesic-based approach succeeded in solving the domain
parameterization issue as above, it is still difficult to create meshes with constraints of mult i-material
interfaces.
This paper focuses on developing an interface-based mesh generation method and further meshing
a geological reservoir in 3D with fu lly geometric constraints of material and boundary surfaces . An
advancing front technique (AFT) is adopted to remesh the extracted interface meshes and the geodesic
distance is utilized to detect collisions and merge fronts during the AFT propagation in 3D. The Lawn
Hill reservoir model is taken as an applicat ion examp le to demonstrate the effectiveness and
usefulness of the proposed approach.

2. Meshing method and implementation
The imp lementation procedures include model import, stratum interfaces and constraints
extraction, background mesh generation, surface remeshing as well as volume mesh generation.

2.1 Background mesh generation
The background mesh is a stratum interface mesh extracted fro m the reservoir model. Multimaterial marching cubes algorithm (Wu and Sullivan 2003) is adopted here to generate the
background mesh and stratum interfaces are separated by their junctions (i.e. con straints).
After the separation, every stratum interface is a man ifold mesh and the mesh boundaries are the
interface constraints. To generate a size field on this background mesh, the junction lines are firstly
segmented by a customized size S seg which is also the size of nodes on the constraints. In the next step,
size h i for node i within the background mesh is calculated by the following fun

which effectively supports the geodesic-based remeshing approaches. In this paper, we iterat ively
create modified geodesic isolines fro m boundaries to the interior of the background mesh and these
isolines are named as fronts. The difficult ies of generating fronts are how to deal with the collisions as
well as mergences. To overcome these difficulties, we p ropose a process including four major steps:
(1) detection zone generation; (2) front mergence; (3) front construction and (4) surface mesh
generation.

2.2.1 Detection zone generation
Region between two ad jacent fronts is a belt and its width is defined by a customized parameter Œ∂.
A layer of nodes in front of the current front forms a detection zone (DZ) and the width of DZ is Œæ.
While Œæ must be larger than Œ∂ concerning the later collision detection, large Œæ could induce heavy
geodesic distance calculation and cost long CPU time. Therefore, an appropriate choice of Œæ is crucial
for efficient detection zone generation.

Figure 1: The appropriate choice of Œæ for front generation.

A 2D example is utilized to illustrate the calculation of Œæ. As shown in Figure 1 (a), AB and CD are
current fronts and the angle between them is 2Œ±. With nodes on AB and CD as source (whose geodesic
distance is 0), front AB and CD are propagated by a distance Œ∂. P is the intersection point of new
fronts. If 2Œ± is too sharp, the quality of elements around P will be poor. To smooth the new front and
improve relative element quality, nodes around P will be utilized as new source to update related
geodesic distances in DZ. It is expected that the updated nodes are included in DZ. As shown in Figure
1 (b), when P is taken as a new source, E is the farthest node affected by P and the distance between
them is Œæ. Therefore, Œæ could be calculated by the following equation.

[

1  sin(D )

(3)

In this paper, we choose Œ±=45 ·©π, hence Œæ is approximately 3.4 Œ∂.

2.2.2 Front mergence
Front mergence process is an essential part of advancing front techniques , which is utilized to
address collisions when two fronts encounter. In this paper, this process is indirectly achieved by DZ
updating. Specifically, a set of collision nodes in DZ are firstly detected by their geodesic distance
informat ion. Then the collision-related nodes are treated as new source to update DZ. The detection
and updating process are invoked alternatively until no collisions exist in DZ.
Collision detection
After generating DZ by Œæ, every node n in DZ contains a geological d istance G(n). As shown in
Figure 2, node P has 8 vicinities vi (i=1, 2,‚Ä¶8). Vector Vi (i=1, 2,‚Ä¶8) are the geological distance

In this paper, a node P is a collision if it satisfies the following criteria:

¬≠0.7 d G ( P) d 1.2

Detection zone updating
As shown in Figure 3, the current front layers are AB and CD wh ile P is the collision node. PE is
the perpendicular to AB through E wh ile PF is the perpendicular to C D through F. The updating
process is achieved by generating a set of new source on EF. This process prohibits creating sharp
angle around P, which will merge front AB and CD together.
On a triangular surface, geodesic distance path could be utilized to achieve the above idea. As
shown in Figure 4 (a), the two green points are the initial source and the DZ is generated by Œæ= 3.4Œ∂,
where Œ∂=8.5 is the customized belt layer width. New belts are indicated by bright blue and they
encounter around the middle of the source points. To achieve the front merging operation, co llisionrelated nodes are collected as new source to update the DZ as shown in Figure 4 (b ). Consequently, the
two belts in Figure 4 (a) are merged into one in Figure 4 (b) and the new fronts (i.e. boundaries of the
bright blue) are merged together as well.

layer merging operation.

2.2.3 Front construction
Fronts are constructed on the boundaries of the new belts. They are actually modified geodesic
isolines. As shown in Figure 5 (a) and (b), the two green points are source. The fronts are constructed
based on Œ∂=8.5 and Œ∂=4.3 respectively. In Figure 5 (b ), there are two fronts in the first two layers. In
the third layer, the fronts encounter with each other and are merged into one as shown in Figure 5 (b).

Figure 5: Front construction: (a) two green points are source and belt width is Œ∂=8.5; (b) belt width is Œ∂=4.3

2.2.4 Surface mesh generation
The generated geodesic isolines divide the surface into a set of belts. Fo r each belt , the boundaries,
i.e. fronts, are a set of segments generated in the front construction process. According to the
background mesh established by Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, the length of these segments is expected to be 1 and
the belt width Œ∂ =2, as shown in Figure 6 (a). Firstly, segment nodes are utilized as source to achieve
geodesic distance diffusion. Secondly, a front propagation method (Peyr√© and Cohen 2006) is
emp loyed to generate a Voronoi diagram for the belt in Figure 6 (b). Lastly, a triangular mesh is
created according to the relationship of Voronoi cells as shown in Figure 6 (c).

Figure 6: Triangular mesh generation for belts: (a) the discrete fronts; (b) Voronoi diagram for the belt; (c)
triangular mesh of the belt.

2.3 Volume Mesh Generation
The above generated surface meshes are utilized as surface constraints to create volume mesh for
the reservoir models. A Delaunay based advancing front technique (Frey and others 1998) is adopted
to generate the volume mesh. The method increases the element size fro m the boundaries to the
interio r. A boundary constraining method (Du and Wang 2004) is also utilized to ensure the
coincidence of adjacent strata.

3. Numerical Applications
The method proposed in this paper is devised for meshing geological reservoir models with a focus
on stratigraphic surface constraints . A reservoir geological model of Lawn Hill in Queensland of
Australia is utilized to demonstrate the meshing capabilities of the proposed method.

3.1 Lawn Hill and Its Geological Model
Lawn Hill platform lies in the Northwestern Queensland, Australia. The Isa superbasin within this
platform hosts the world-class Century Zn-Pb-Ag deposits and is also well known for the Iron Oxide
Copper and Gold deposits . The mineral exp lorat ion and related subjects attract interests of numerous
researchers (Feltrin 2008; Gold ing and others 2006; Zhang and others 2006). Integration of the
knowledge - and data-driven models is considered as an effective way to assist the resource exploration
and environmental assessment. Lawn Hill model constructed by using Go CAD (Figure 7) is taken here
as an application example. It covers 140.5√ó161.5√ó19.4 km3 (where depth is doubled in the
visualization data) and is described by a 3D digital image with 71 million voxels (Figure 7).

Figure 7: The Lawn Hill model which is built by GoCAD with 71 million voxels.

3.2 Surface Remeshing for the Lawn Hill Model
A rock stratum interface, is utilized to demonstrate the proposed surface remeshing approach in
detail. The element size and mesh adaptive features are controlled by parameters in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2.
S seg is the element size on the interface boundaries and S max is defined as the maximu m size in the
interior of the interface. q is the gradation ratio, which controls the speed of increasing from S max to
S seg . As shown in Figure 8 (a)-(c) and their close-ups (d)-(f) are mesh results with different parameters.
Co mparing Figure 8 (a) with (b), they have the same S max=20 and S seg =2.5 but different q. In Figure 8
(a) q is 1.1, wh ile it is 1.2 in Figure 8 (b). Therefore, the element size in Figure 8 (a) increases slower
than that in Figure 8 (b). The parameters S max and S seg also significantly affect the performance of the
mesh. While q in Figure 8 (c) is 1.1 the same as Figure 8 (a), S max=30 and S seg =5 are different fro m
Figure 8 (a). Obviously, large S max and Sseg lead to a sparse mesh. The element nu mbers of Figure 8 (a)(c) are 12872, 8846 and 5639 respectively.

Smax =30, q=1.1 and Sseg=5; (d), (e) and (f) are the close-ups of (a), (b) and (c) respectively.

3.3 Volume Mesh Generation for Lawn Hill Model
The integrated process of mesh generation for the Lawn Hill model is demonstrated as below.
Firstly, the interfaces of rock strata are extracted and meshed by the proposed method. One o f such
interface meshes is shown in Figure 9 (a). Secondly, these interface meshes are combined together
according to constraints. Figure 9 (b ) is the combined surface mesh with 90 thousand nodes and 187
thousand elements. Lastly, the tetrahedral volu me mesh in Figure 9 (c) is generated by taking Figure 9
(b) as input. The volume mesh has only 166 thousand nodes and 967 thousand elements, which is
much s maller than the original vo xel model (71 million vo xels). Additionally, the 10 co mponents of
this model and their volu me meshes can be identified after the volume meshing process , as shown in
Figure 9 (d).
Our mesh generation code can be run on both supercomputers (e.g. SGI Alt ix ICE 8200 EX with
128 Intel Xeon quad-core processors) and desktop PCs. To evaluate the meshing efficiency and
compare with the others, the volume mesh generation is performed on a DELL PC, wh ich has 4 Gb
memo ry and four Intel(R) Core(TM )2 Quad CPUs ( Q9400@2.66GHz ). The generation method
spends 80 seconds on the Lawn Hill model, in other words the mesh generation speed is 12,000
element/second. In Table 1, four methods (Lo 1997; Shewchuk 2002) are utilized to measure the
element quality of the generated volume mesh in Figure 9 (c). The average element qualit ies of the
volume mesh are close to the regular tetrahedron, which are considered as analysis-suitable for finite
element simulation.

4. Conclusion and Future Research
This paper proposes a mesh approach for meshing 3D geological reservoir models with arb itrary
stratigraphic interfaces as constraints. The proposed approach has been successfully applied in
meshing Lawn Hill reservoir model. The following conclusions are drawn:
1. The proposed geodesic-based advancing front technique can extract and describe the detailed
geological structure and material properties . The proposed surface remeshing approach can
identify and take interface junction as constraints to create elements paralleling to such
constraints.
2.

906

The proposed method provides a flexib le way to control adaptive surface mesh generation
through customized parameters such as the gradation ratio q, the allowab le maximu m mesh
size S max and the allowable maximu m boundary segment size S seg . Specifically, large

Mesh generation for 3D geological reservoirs

gradation ratio q leads to a rapid size increasing. Maximu m element size S max and boundary
segment size S seg control the element quantity and the larger they are, the less the element
quantity is created.
3.

The generated surface meshes serve as constraints in the volu me mesh generation, and thus
the proposed method can generate volu me meshes with constrained stratum interfaces. The
clearly identified co mponents in the Lawn Hill reservoir model demonstrated its usefulness
and effectiveness.

4.

Co mpared with the original vo xel models, the proposed method can create mesh with s maller
data. In the Lawn Hill model, the orig inal model has 71 million vo xels while the generated
volume mesh model has only 166 thousand nodes and 967 thousand elements .

Future work will focus on development of quadrilateral surface and hexahedron mesh generation
for 3D geological reservoir models . Co mbining with previous research on the 2D quadrilateral mesh
generation (Liu and Xing 2013; Liu and others 2011), the proposed approach will be extended for the
unstructured hexahedron mesh generation.
