Abstract. The entropic lattice Boltzmann method (ELBM) has recently been shown to be capable of simulating incompressible ﬂows with
good accuracy and enhanced stability. However, the method requires
that uniform grids be used, which makes it prohibitively expensive for
simulating large Reynolds number ﬂows. In this paper, an interpolation
scheme is proposed to extend the applicability of this method to arbitrary non-uniform meshes, while retaining the salient features of ELBM
such as stability and computational eﬃciency. The new scheme is used
to simulate ﬂow in a lid driven cavity as well as ﬂow past a square cylinder and is shown to largely reduce the grid requirements. The results of
the simulation agree very well with other numerical experimental data
available in the literature

Introduction

In the last decade the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has attracted a lot of attention and is fast emerging as an alternative to ﬁnite volume and ﬁnite element
techniques. Lattice Boltzmann methods have been successful in simulating many
simple and complex hydrodynamics including turbulent ﬂows[1]. The main attractions of LBM are ease of implementation, high computational eﬃciency and
easy parallelizability. There are many variations of LBM in use, among which are
ﬁnite volume Lattice Boltzmann method, multiple relaxation Lattice Boltzmann
methods, interpolation supplemented Lattice Boltzmann method, and entropic
Lattice Boltzmann method.
The Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) initially originated as a ﬂoating point
recast of the evolution equation of lattice-gas cellular automaton dynamics. The
simplest form of LBE, namely, the Lattice Bhatnagar Gross Krook (LBGK)
form, can be written as follows.

density. The right hand side of the equation represents the single relaxation time

One of the shortcomings of the LBM is numerical instability. The reason for
the instability is that no bounds are imposed on the values fieq and fi during
the collision process making it possible for fi to take negative values depriving
it of any physical sense [2]. One of the ways to ensure the positivity of fi is
to deﬁne the corresponding equilibrium value as a minimum of a convex function, known as the H function, under the constraint of the local conservation
laws [2].
Apart from the stability issue, another well known problem associated with
the discrete velocity models is non-adherence to the equation of the state [3],[4].
In these models, the local equilibrium entropy does not obey the thermodynamic deﬁnition of the temperature being a function of entropy and energy [4].
These issues were addressed in the formulation of the ELBM [4],[5],[6],[7]. This
is discussed in the next section.
As described by Eq. 1, particles at a lattice site undergo collision followed by
advection. The left hand side of Eq. 1 can be split into two parts viz. calculation of
fi (x, t + δt ) (updating post collision values) and calculation of fi (x + ci δt , t + δt )
(advection in the direction ci ). This advection however can be done only to the
neighboring lattice sites at a distance of ci δt which constrains the lattice used for
the simulation to be a uniform square mesh. This issue was addressed by He et
al [8] for a 9 velocity LBE model, wherein the extension of LBE for nonuniform
meshes was outlined. The objective of the present work is to extend the ELBM
method to non-uniform meshes also using the methodology outline by He et al [8].

Entropic Lattice Boltzmann Method

The construction of the entropic Lattice Boltzmann method (ELBM) is based
on a good choice of the discrete velocities, the H function and an expression for
the equilibrium values[9]. The discrete form of the H function is derived from the
continuous Boltzmann H function given by F ln F dc where F (x, c) is the single
particle distribution function, x is the position vector and c is the continuous

74

velocity. For 2D athermal cases, the discrete form the H function can be written
as

H(Wi ,fi ) =
fi ln
(4)

where fi represents discrete velocities and Wi the weights associated with each
direction. The weights in one dimension are {1/6, 2/3, 1/6} for the directions
’Right’, ’Zero’ and ’Left’ respectively and the weights for higher dimensions
can be constructed by multiplying the weights associated with each component
direction[10]. The equilibrium value of the discrete velocity is the minimizer of
the corresponding H function under the constraints of local conservation laws
given by Eq. 3. The explicit solution for the fieq in D dimensions is
fieq = ρWi

where j is the index for spatial directions, cs is the velocity of sound and the
exponent cij /cs can only take the values +1, 0, -1. H can be guaranteed to remain
non-increasing everywhere by a two step process explained in Fig. 1. The population is changed ﬁrst by keeping the H constant. In the second step dissipation
is introduced to decrease H. It can be guessed that in the steady state i.e. when
fieq = fi , value of H remains constant. The BGK form of the collision in ELBM is
fi (x + ci δt , t + δt ) − fi (x, t) = αβ [fi (x, t) − fieq (x, t)]

where β = 6/(1 + 6ν) is the relaxation frequency with ν being the kinematic

collision, the point M coincides with f eq

where ∆ represents the bare departure from the local equilibrium i.e. ∆ = f eq −f .
The value of α is usually close to 2 (and equal to 2 when f = f eq ). The procedure
for explicit calculation of α was described by Ansumali and Karlin [10]. By using
diﬀerent value for α at each lattice site, the relaxation time is adjusted locally
to ensure compliance with the H theorem. This guarantees the positivity of the
distribution function, which gives the scheme good non-linear stability.

Entropic Lattice Boltzmann Method on Non-uniform
Grids

The ELBM as outlined above is restricted to uniform square meshes. With increasing Reynolds number, this results in a tremendous increase in the total
number of points required and hence an increase in computation time. Moreover, ELBM is computationally more expensive than LBM because of multiple
calculations of ln function at every lattice point. The present work aims at
extending the applicability of ELBM to arbitrary nonuniform meshes which can
help reduce the total number of grid points required for a simulation.
The distribution functions (f ) in LB models are continuous functions in both
space and time, although they are used to represent population of particles
locally. This gives us scope for interpolation schemes to be used in the interior
of the computational domain and extrapolation schemes at the boundary.
In short, the implementation of ELBM on nonuniform grids can be explained
in the following steps:
1. Start with an initially guessed ﬂow ﬁeld.
2. For each lattice site, calculate f eq according to Eq. 5 and hence ﬁnd ∆
(= f eq − f ).
3. Calculate α by solving the nonlinear equation 7.
4. Perform collision according to equation 6.
5. Advect the post collision values to appropriate neighboring nodes (imaginary
square lattice on which the LB automaton resides).
6. Calculate the values on the ‘actual’ lattice sites (mesh used in the simulation)
by means of quadratic interpolation.
7. Apply the necessary boundary conditions.
8. Goto step 2.
It should be noted that step 5 can be combined with step 6, eliminating the
need to store and maintain the values of fi on the nodes of the imaginary lattice.
Computationally ELBM can be divided into three kernels viz. collision (steps 2,
3, 4), advection and interpolation (steps 5 and 6), boundary conditions (step 7).
In general, collision accounts for about 90% of the total computational load, and
advection and interpolation about 8%.
In the case of ELBM on square grids i.e. without interpolation being done
on the grid, the time spent in collision accounts for almost 98% of the computational load. This shows that the overhead associated with the introduction

76

of the interpolation routine is not very high. It will be shown in the coming
sections that the savings incurred in terms of grids is enormous and more than
compensates for the extra calculation being done in interpolation.

Enhancement in Reynolds Number

Another advantage of using nonuniform or rectangular meshes is the possibility
of increasing the Reynolds number of the simulation for a given number of grid
points and without any loss of stability. The Reynolds number of the simulation,
Re is equal to U Lchar /ν where U is the reference velocity, ν is kinematic viscosity in lattice units and Lchar is the characteristic length for the ﬂow in grid units
and is equal to Nchar δ mesh /δ automaton . Here δ mesh is the spacing of the computational grid and δ automaton is the spacing of the grid on which the automaton
resides. Nchar is the number of grid points per characteristic length measured
on the latter grid. Now for square uniform meshes, δ automaton = δ mesh . However
for rectangular and nonuniform meshes, δ mesh can be chosen to be greater than
δ automaton resulting in increase in the Reynolds number of the simulation by a
factor of δ mesh /δ automaton . The use of nonuniform and rectangular grids does
not aﬀect the stability of the system (or the LB automaton) as the δ automaton is
not being altered. Hence for a given number of grid points, the Reynolds number
is enhanced. Moreover, by choosing diﬀerent levels of grid spacing it is possible
to greatly reduce the number grid points required for the simulation.

Results and Discussion

In this section, results from numerical simulations using ELBM on non-uniform
grids are presented. Both steady (lid driven cavity ﬂow) and unsteady ﬂows (ﬂow
past a square) are simulated to demonstrate the suitability of the methodology.
5.1

Lid Driven Cavity Flow

In this classical test problem, ﬂuid is contained within three stationary walls while
the fourth (top) wall moves with a certain velocity. This results in the formation
of a large primary vortex near the center of the cavity and smaller vortices (two or
three, depending on the Reynolds numbers) near the corners. A non-uniform mesh
with about 60-100 grid points along each side of the cavity has been used for the
simulations. Diﬀusive boundary condition [11] has been used for all the four walls.
In the diﬀusive boundary condition, the corners can be associated with either of
the walls or the normal can be made to be inclined at a 45o angle. In the current
implementation, the corners are treated as points belonging to the side walls (left
or right). The other choice for the association of corner points is also possible and
would not aﬀect the ﬂow by a great extent as three of the four diagonal speeds
(f ) do not propagate into the domain. The results of the simulation compare well
with those available in the literature as shown in Table 1.

Flow Past a Square

Here, ﬂow past a square immersed in a stream of ﬂuid is considered. As shown in
the ﬁgure, a square of side Lchar is placed symmetrically at a location 10Lchar
down stream of the inlet AB. The size of the computational domain is 45Lchar
in the direction of the ﬂow and 25Lchar perpendicular to the ﬂow (resulting
in a blockage ratio of 4%). The side CD represents the outlet boundary, and

the sides BC and DA are free stream boundaries. This ﬂow becomes unsteady
for Reynolds numbers above 40 or so. If the dominant frequency of the vortex
shedding is denoted by nf then the Strouhal number of the ﬂow is nf Lchar /U∞ ,
where U∞ is the free stream velocity. In the past, several techniques such as
the Finite Diﬀerence, Finite Volume and Lattice Boltzmann methods, have successfully predicted the Strouhal number - Reynolds number relation at low and

78

moderate Reynolds numbers [17],[18]. At high Reynolds numbers, conventional
techniques face diﬃculties such as enormous grid requirements, lack of stability and lack of a good exit boundary condition [1]. The diﬃculty with the exit
boundary condition can be handled by increasing the domain size in the direction
of ﬂow, albeit, at a tremendous increase in the computational cost. In contrast,
the non-linear stability of the entropic Lattice Boltzmann method together with
lesser grid requirements gives an added advantage over the normal LB methods.
Thus, the usage of non-uniform grids with ELBM makes it possible to simulate
the ﬂow at high Reynolds numbers and with a reduced computational cost. Table
2 shows the variation of Strouhal number with Reynolds number as predicted
by experiments and numerical calculations. It is evident that the present calculations are able to predict the Strouhal number very well and the agreement is
better than that of the results available in the literature so far. The grid sizes
used in the present case are much smaller than the grid requirements of normal
LBM. At high Reynolds numbers, the Nchar used in the current case ranges from
30-50, whereas the Nchar required for normal LBM would be around 128-256 [19]
resulting in more than an order of magnitude savings in the grid requirement
(Table 2).

Conclusion

An interpolation scheme to enable the use of non-uniform meshes is proposed for
the entropic lattice Boltzmann method. The method has been successfully used
for simulating the steady ﬂow in a lid driven cavity and the unsteady ﬂow over
a rectangular cylinder for Reynolds number up to 3000. For the former problem,
the location as well as the value of the streamfunction at the center of the vortices is predicted very well by the present calculations, when compared with data
available in the literature. For the latter problem, the unsteady vortex shedding
frequency predicted by the method compares well with the experimental values
reported by Okajima [16]. The proposed interpolation scheme preserves all the
salient features of ELBM, like stability, and locality of the collision operator.

Moreover, the interpolation itself is a very small addition to the overall computational cost. Considerable savings in grid sizes are shown to be possible by
comparing with earlier implementations of LBM. This interpolation scheme is
quite general and can be easily implemented on diﬀerent types of grids.
