Abstract. Excluding the assumption of normality in return distributions, a general reward-risk ratio suitable to compare portfolio returns with respect to a
benchmark must includes asymmetrical information on both “good” volatility
(above the benchmark) and “bad” volatility (below the benchmark), with different sensitivities. Including the Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio and few other indexes
recently proposed by the literature, the class of one-sided variability measures
achieves the goal. We investigate the forecasting ability of eleven alternatives
ratios in portfolio optimization problems. We employ data from security markets to quantify the portfolio’s overperformance with respect to a given
benchmark.

1 Introduction
Investment performance evaluation requires appropriate tools for ranking different risky
projects. Nowadays most practitioners employ reward-risk indexes developed by academics. Nevertheless, only with normality assumption the uncertainty of future wealth is
fully captured by the first two moments of the excess return’s distribution. In presence
of kurtosis and skewness, two-sided reward and risk measures, i.e. the average excess
return and a dispersion measure considering both positive and negative deviations from
the mean, do not separate information about overperformance and underperformance,
causing an anomaly since investors typically distinguish between upside and downside risk. In recent years several alternatives to the Sharpe ratio has been proposed to
avoid sub-optimal choices in portfolio selection problems. Some of these redefine the
risk measure in the denominator, such as the Gini ratio [13], [16], the mean absolute
deviation (MAD) ratio [8], the stable ratio [1], [7], the mini-max ratio [17], the SortinoSatchell ratio [14], [15], [12], the VaR and STARR ratios, [6], [9]. The first three refer
to modified versions of the dispersion (risk) measure. The Sortino-Satchell, VaR and
STARR ratios have a denominator that accounts for downside risk (the mini-max ratio is a special case of STARR). Performance indexes based on one-sided variability

measures such as the Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio [3], [4], [5] and Rachev’s ratios [1], [2]
use instead an upper partial moment (deviations above the benchmark, for the reward),
and a lower partial moment (deviations belove the benchmark, for the risk) of different
orders. The higher the order, the higher the agent’s inclination towards or dislike of the
extreme events.1
The performance measures mentioned above lead to different optimal allocation.
Moreover, since the joint distribution of future total returns are not known but can be
only estimated, an empirical analysis is needed to exploit the ranking of alternative
performance indexes. We will illustrate results from portfolio optimization problems
considering five time series of total return indexes from 3 countries and employing 11
performance indexes. Historical data show high volatility affecting the joint empirical
distribution of returns which is fat-tailed.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews one-sided variability measures.
Section 3 formulates the optimal portfolio problem, and contains the numerical examples and the back tests. Section 4 contains some concluding remarks.

2 One-Sided Variability Measures
Let R be a p-integrable random variable representing the total return over a fixed horizon related to a certain investment. A general performance index is given by the ratio
Φ(R) := r(R)/ρ(R), for the investment opportunity having reward r(R) and risk ρ(R).
The higher Φ(R), the more preferable the risky trade R.
Given a benchmark2 b, the excess portfolio return writes X = R − b. One-sided
variability measures are to be used if we want to separate information about the likelihood of a positive performance above the minimum acceptable return, X > 0, and the
likelihood of underperforming the target return, X < 0. Recently, Farinelli and Tibiletti
(see [3], [4], and [5]) have introduced a new reward-risk index based on the right-sided
moment of p-th order3 E[(X + )p ]1/p (used to value reward r(X)) and the left-sided
moment of q-th order E[(X − )q ]1/q (used to value risk ρ(X)). The choice of p and q
reflects different agent’s feelings about the consequences of either overperformance or
underperformance. A small value for the left order, q < 1, is appropriate if the agent
is willing to fail the target without particular regard to the amount. When large deviations below b harm more than the small ones, then one can chooses q > 1. A similar
reasoning applies to selecting the proper right order.
The idea behind Rachev’s ratios is similar, but instead of looking at the positive or
negative dispersion around the expectation, the focus is on the left and right tail of
the excess portfolio return’s distribution. In the Rachev’s Generalized Ratio one has
r(X) := E (X + )γ | X ≥ −V aR1−α and ρ(X) := E (X − )δ | X ≤ −V aRβ , where

This conceptual line is similar to that of a pension fund manager’s view. He synthesizes between the portfolio manager’s aim (to beat the chosen benchmark, controlling upside risk) and
the risk manager’s aim (to control downside risk).
The portfolio under consideration consists in a long position of the effective managed portfolio
and a short position of the benchmark, such as a life/non-life insurance liability, a market index
and a money market instrument.
Here x− denotes − min{x, 0} and x+ denotes max{0, x}.

α, β ∈ (0, 1), the parameters γ, δ > 0 behave similarly to p and q, while the Value-atRisk is defined as V aRc := − inf{x | P(X ≤ x) > c}.

3 Back Test of Performance Indexes
Investors wish to maximize a performance measure finding an optimal risky portfolio
regarded as the “market portfolio” in which to invest their wealth. In finite dimensional
setting, let r = (r1 , . . . , rN ) be a random vector representing the total returns of N
assets over a fixed horizon.4 The optimal risky portfolio w = (w1 , . . . , wN ) solves the
static stochastic optimization problem (SSO)
max Φ(r w)

w∈W
N

(1)

s.t. W := w ∈ R | e w = 0, lB ≤ w ≤ uB
where e is a vector of ones, lB and uB are the vectors of lower bounds and upper
bounds for portfolio weights.5 With problem (1) in mind, we do an empirical comparison among the performance indexes in order to verify their forecasting ability when the
reward measures and the risk measures used admit different definitions with respect to
the traditional Sharpe ratio, particularly those ratios based on one-sided variability measures. Considering several time steps, we chose the unit time step equal to 1 month and
model the re-allocation decision with a sequence of one-period SSOs.6 In the following,
we refer to (rti )t=−T,...,0,1....,h as the time series of stock index i, where T denotes the
size of sample data, and h is the time lag.
3.1 Numerical Examples
To analyze the behavior of the 11 performance indexes mentioned in this paper, we
propose an application to stock portfolio optimization. The primary issue being optimization, we employ the Exponential Weighted Moving Average model (EWMA) for
forecasting the future total returns. One expects some of the optimized portfolio will
generate an overperformance.7
– Asset universe. Five stock indexes with reinvested dividend (total return indexes)
from 3 countries: S&P500 (i = 1), DowJones (i = 2), NASDAQ (i = 3), FTSE
(i = 4), and NIKKEI (i = 5). Benchmark: T-bill as a proxy for the risk-free rate
(i = 6). Number of assets: N = 6.

Assume the discrete compounding convention.
Given the total return R = r wp , the benchmark can be represented as b = r wb . Hence, the
total excess return can be represented as X = r w, where the difference w = wp − wb is
termed as excess weights. Note that wp = (0, w2 , . . . , wN ) and wb = (1, 0, . . . , 0) , hence
the benchmark’s return is a component of r.
This choice guarantees stochastic independence over time, since the historical returns we will
use are weakly stationary. Otherwise, a stochastic dynamic programming approach were more
adequate, though the pseudo-dynamic optimization approach we will use is a good starting
point to estimate the solution of the former.
If that is true, it is admissible to say that a performance ratio has a forecasting power.

– Historical data. A data set comprising monthly total returns and T-bill rates from
April 2, 1984, to October 3, 2005, for a total of 258 × 6 observations.8 Note that
t = 0 corresponds to February 1, 2005 and t = h = 8 to October 3, 2005. The
initial data set contains T = 250 observations and it is used for estimation and
forecasting purposes.
– Investment inequality restrictions. Two cases considered, to test the model by
imposing a set of “weak” lower and upper bounds and then “stronger” ones.
(a) lB = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0) , uB = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 1) .
(b) lB = (0.1, 0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.02, 0) , uB = (0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 1) .
Assume the investors have an initial wealth W0 = 1 and invest it to purchase the market
portfolio r w. On t = 0, the investment is rolled-forward monthly. The final value of
wealth is computed recursively by the following algorithm (A1):9

Farinelli-Tibiletti ratio the investment performance is ranked either 9th or 10th based
on agent’s feelings towards overperformance above the risk-free rate. If the invest8

In this study period all the stock indexes are very volatile, have a positive correlation, and weak
stochastic dependence over time.
The optimization problem (1) gives raise to the optimal excess weights w∗ := wb + wp ∗ .
Clearly, we have implemented this problem by imposing wb = 0 (no cash position).
The weights are given by gi = θi−1 / 1≤i≤5 θi−1 , where θi = λ∗i / 1≤i≤5 λ∗i .
The authors have developed an algorithm coded in MATLAB c . Moreover, to estimate the
alpha index of return stability they used the Stable software by John P. Nolan [11]. A forthcoming version of the software will embed the quantile estimation algorithm coded by J. H.
McCulloch [10]. All the values are rounded to the first fourteen decimals.

ment management provides information about the history of stock prices, the investors
can modify their preferences requiring alternative portfolio restrictions according to the
empirical features of past returns. Case (b) corresponds to claim a greater investment
in S&P500 and FSTE than in the remaining stock indexes, since these two assets have
showed “better” skewness and kurtosis features during the past 258 months than the
other assets as it can be seen in table 2. The values of final wealth with those new portfolio constrains considered in (A 1) are listed in table 3. We note the Farinelli-Tibiletti
ratio with left order p = 2 and right order q = 0.5 having a superior forecasting power
than the Sharpe ratio, since this parameter setting better fits the agent’s willingness to a
performance over the benchmark, but a lower risk.
The Sharpe ratio has a low forecasting ability, while the Sortino-Satchell ratio provides a more robust performance evaluation. Nevertheless, indexes based on one-sided

Evaluating the portfolio’s performance with respect to a benchmark additionally requires an out-of-sample analysis. We employ two moving windows: within the first
(length 1 month) the final values of wealth (for each indexes) are calculated; within the
second (length 9 months) the robustness of investment ranking for all the ratios involved
in the optimization procedure is tested. The robustness check algorithm follows:
start December 1, 1992
for k = 1 to 17
with a sample of 100 data points do
(A 1)

stop October 3, 2005
return allocation rule: ‘‘rank the indexes and choose always that
has performed the best during each period of length 9 months’’
Results from robustness check algorithm are shown in table 4 in the case (b).12

4 Conclusion
In this paper we solve a portfolio optimization problem comparing eleven performance
indexes recently proposed by the literature, studying their behavior on wealth investment. Indexes based on one-sided variability measures are a flexible tool for modelling
the agent’s beliefs about either underperformance or overperformance a given benchmark. Further empirical tests will be the subject of future research. Particularly, we need

to investigate the influence of the forecasting model for the expected returns, since from
the mean-variance framework it is well known that optimal allocation depend in a very
sensitive way on the expected returns.
