Abstract. With the rapid development of network technologies and deteriorating
of network environment, traditional single-net security system can’t satisfy the
security requirement. Excellent security performance of biological systems
impels bio-inspired network security theory to be a hot topic currently. We
advance Bio-inspired Multi-Net Security (B-MNS) system which implements the
functional distributary of different subnets by state transition in Multi-Net
Paralleling (MNP) mechanism. Firstly, concept model of B-MNS and MNP
mechanism are outlined; secondly, parameter estimation and modifying
algorithms are introduced to construct the mathematical model of B-MNS; at
last, the practicability and high efficiency are proved by a simulation.
Keywords: bio-inspired; multi-net paralleling; hidden Markov; LoadRunner.

1 Introduction
With the development of network technologies and the deterioration of network
entironment, traditional security system can’t satisfy the security requirement. Similar
security mechanisms between biology and computer network make it possible to
solve the network security problems inspired by biology. Bio-inspired research started
in the middle of 1990s[1, 2]. In current, bio-inspired research mainly focuses on
computer immune system[3], anti-virus immune system[4] and bio-inspired fault
tolerance computing[5], which are all limited in the immune system. We are inspired
by the “Multi-Net” security mechanism and apply them into the design of B-MNS.
The paper is organized as follows: Based on BMNSM[6], section 2 presents the
concept model of B-MNS. Section 3 constructs the mathematical model. By a
simulation, section 4 compares the performance of B-MNS and traditional security
system. Section 5 presents some conclusions and proposes future work on B-MNS.

2 Concept Model for B-MNS
In the intricate and mutable survival environment, biological systems keep high
security performance and implement the normal running, which owe to the perfect
security system of biology. The key mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1)

Multi layers. (2) Multi time sequences. (3) Multi nets. Close cooperating with each
other, several independent “Nets” complete the security of system. So, the core of
security system in specific biological population scale is MNP mechanism.
Inspired by this, B-MNS is divided into three angles: Population Scale, Time Stage
and Subnet Type. Monitoring subnet monitors the data transmitted by data
transmission subnet and implements precaution, detection and response. Recovery
subnet deals with the abnormal information and recovers the network state.
Corresponding mechanism takes charge of synchronization and information transfer
between three subnets. MNP is embodied as “Three-Net-Paralleling”(Figure 1).

3 Mathematical Model
To a given observation sequence O = O1, O2, …, OT, Baum-Welch algorithm will find
out a λ=(Π, A, B) which maximizes P(O/λ).We select O= (C, C, C) as the example
sequence, so the final estimation results are showed in table 1.

4 Simulation
Figure 2(a) and 2(b) respectively describes the changing of Hits-Throughput in singlenet system and B-MNS. The average Hits and throughput in single-net system
respectively is 5.206 times/second (t/s) and 25815.54 Bytes/second (B/s); the average
Hits and throughput in B-MNS respectively is 10.851 t/s and 52443.666 B/s.

During the simulation, Http response ability of single-net system is common,
which is showed in figure 3(a). In B-MNS, under the help of corresponding
mechanism, three subnets in B-MNS implement the functional distributary. The Http
response in B-MNS is showed in figure 3(b).
Comparing of Http responses is showed in table 2.

5 Conclusion
Traditional single-net security system can’t adapt to the increasing user requirement
and aggravating network environment. Inspired by multi-net security mechanism of
biological system, we advanced MNP mechanism. In this paper, we put forward BMNS. Simulation results prove that the performance of B-MNS improves 3-4 times
than that of single-net system. In the future work, we’ll integrate the security methods
and technologies in time stages of B-MNS.
