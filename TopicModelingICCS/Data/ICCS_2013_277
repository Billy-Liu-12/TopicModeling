Abstract
This paper is devoted to determining the stability conditions for the finite difference based lattice Boltzmann method
(FDLBM). In the current scheme, the 9-bit two-dimensional (D2Q9) model is used and the collision term of the BhatnagarGross-Krook (BGK) is treated implicitly. The implicitness of the numerical scheme is removed by introducing a new
distribution function different from that being used. Therefore, a new explicit finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method is
obtained. Stability analysis of the resulted explicit scheme is done using Fourier expansion. Then, stability conditions in
terms of time and spatial steps, relaxation time and explicitly-implicitly parameter are determined by calculating the
eigenvalues of the given difference system. The determined conditions give the ranges of the parameters that have stable
solutions.

1. Introduction
The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been suggested as a different approach from the conventional
computational fluid dynamics. The LBM becomes an efficient tool for simulating a variety of transport
phenomena and fluid dynamics problems [1-4]. The main idea of the LBM is to compute the physical reality of
a flow field through a kinetic approach at mesoscopic scale that preserves the hydrodynamic conservation law
[5]. Originally, the LBM has been developed from the lattice gas automaton (LGA) [6] model, however, the
collision operator was linearized and the single time relaxation (BGK) approximation was adopted [5].

The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is a discrete scheme of the continuous Boltzmann equation that
provides a way to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the LBM. Any standard numerical
technique can serve the purpose of solving the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation. In order to increase
computational efficiency and accuracy by handling nonuniform grids, several traditional numerical methods
such as the finite- difference, finite-volume, and finite-element methods have been introduced into LBM [8
12]. In the continuous Boltzmann equation, discretization for the particle velocity can be decoupled from the
spatial discretization, since the particle velocity in the Boltzmann equation is independent of the particle
position [7]. When the LBM is viewed as a finite-difference method for solving the continuum discrete-velocity
Boltzmann equations, it becomes clear that numerical accuracy and stability issues should be addressed [8,1318].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the standard two-dimensional 9-bit (D2Q9) lattice
Boltzmann method is briefly introduced. Section 3 covers the finite-difference based LBM. The stability
analysis of the FDLBM scheme is introduced in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions and future work of the
results are drowning in Section 5.
2. The Lattice Boltzmann Method
The lattice Boltzmann model utilizes the distribution function f for the flow, which is calculated by solving
the lattice Boltzmann equation. After introducing BGK approximation [5], the general form of the Lattice
Boltzmann equation is given by,
t eq
(1)
fi ( x ci t , t
t ) fi ( x, t )
fi ( x, t ) fi ( x, t )
The type of the problem that needs to be solved is determined by the definition of the local equilibrium
distribution function. The equilibrium distribution function, is defined by,

f ieq

where i denotes the equilibrium distribution weight and ci denotes the discrete velocity in the direction of i.
c

The Navier Stokes equation may be recovered from the evolution LBM equation using a Chapman Enskog
expansion for the density distribution function. Therefore, the single relaxation time for hydrodynamics in
terms of the kinematic viscosity may be given as,

3. The Finite Difference-Based Lattice Boltzmann Method
Firstly, let us rewrite the LBE (1) in a continuum Boltzmann equation form as follows,
fi

(7)
c fi
f i ( x, t ) f i ( x, t ) ,
t
In order to invoking non-uniform mesh and to improve the numerical stability of the LBM, the above
equations may be discretized using any standard numerical scheme. In this work, we use a finite differencebased LBGK scheme proposed by Guo and Zhao [8]. Firstly, let us discretize with respect to time, Eq. (7)
becomes,

f in

where w

collision scheme is obtained if
1 . Mixed explicit0 and a fully implicit collision scheme is obtained if
implicit scheme can be obtained by changing the parameter value between 0 and 1, i.e. 0
1 . Guo and
Zhao [8] reported that for a single LBE the collision term reaches the second-order accuracy in time only at
0.5 . In order to eliminate the implicitness of the above scheme, we introduce the following new
distribution function,
(9)
Fi f i w f i f ieq
The corresponding equilibrium distribution function is given by, Fieq fieq . The macroscopic density and
velocity may be rewritten as,
Fi , u

Eq. (8) can be rewritten in terms of the new distribution functions as follows,

In this work, we discretize the convection term of the above equation using a second-order upwind finitedifference scheme to discretize the spatial derivatives of Fi in x and y directions as follow,

4. Stability Analysis of the FDLBM Scheme
In this section, the stability conditions of the finite difference-based lattice Boltzmann method (FDLBM)
scheme are determined. The FDLBM scheme introduced above is an explicit procedure, so it is worth to
investigate the largest time-step consistent with the stability. Before going to the stability analysis, it is
convenient to rewrite Eq. (11) as follows,

Mei and Shyy [12] proposed to calculate fieq ,n 1 at a new time level using a linear extrapolation scheme
from the two previous time levels as follows,
(15)
fieq,n 1 2 fieq,n fieq,n 1
Substituting from Eq. (15) into Eq. (14) one gets,

At an arbitrary time the general terms of the Fourier expansion for Fi becomes, Fi

at any time step and after one time-step it is denoted

i ( ax by)
. Similarly, fieq , n and fieq ,n 1 may be expressed in terms of Fourier expansion fieq
,
by
i (t )e
however, the function i (t ) may be treated as a constant because they are known from the previous steps.
Thus, fieq,n Ci1ei (ax by) and fieq,n 1 Ci 2ei ( ax by) , where Ci1 and Ci 2 . Substituting these expressions into
Eq. (16), we get different expressions for the convection term based on the values of lattice velocities cix and

Seeking the stability of the above system, the moduli of each of the eigenvalues of the coefficients matrix A
should be calculated. For a stable system the eigenvalues should be less than or equal to unity. Therefore, the

5. Conclusions and Future Work
From this paper, we may conclude that the FDLB scheme is conditionally stable under the restrictions (22)(30). The stability conditions are determined in terms of time and spatial steps, relaxation time and explicitlyimplicitly parameter. The formulas of these conditions give the ranges of the parameters that have stable

solutions. Extension of this analysis to include more complex models such as D3Q19 and D3Q27 or any other
model is straightforward. Also, similar analysis of more complex physics models such as thermal and solutal
transport can be obtained.
