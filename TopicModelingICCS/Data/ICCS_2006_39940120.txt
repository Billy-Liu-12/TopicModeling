Abstract. Packet sampling has become an attractive and scalable
means to measure ﬂow data on high-speed links. Passive traﬃc measurement increasingly employs sampling at the packet level and makes
inferences from sampled network traﬃc. This paper proposes a maximum probability method that estimates the length of the corresponding
original ﬂow from the length of a sampled ﬂow. We construct the probability models of the original ﬂow length distributions of a sampled ﬂow
under the assumptions of various ﬂow length distributions, respectively.
Through recovery analyzing with diﬀerent parameters, we obtain a consistent linear expression that reﬂects the relationship between the length
of sampled ﬂow and that of the corresponding original ﬂow. Furthermore,
after using publicly available traces and traces collected from CERNET
to do recovery experiments and comparing the experiment outcomes and
theoretic values calculated with Pareto distributions, we may conclude
that the maximum probability method calculated by using the Pareto
distribution with 1.0 can be used to estimate original ﬂow length in the
concerned network.

Introduction

With the rapid increase of network service types and user number, measuring the
volume of network traﬃc and network performance is becoming more diﬃcult.
Packet sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure ﬂow
data. Sampling entails an inherent loss of information. There are some studies
in [1-4] that use statistic inference to recover information as much as possible.
However, to our knowledge the above studies are not available to estimate length
of the original ﬂow by the given sampled ﬂow length. The original ﬂow length
is very important for many applications, e.g., Resources Required for Collecting
Flow Statistics, Characterizing Source Traﬃc and Determining thresholds for
setting up connections in ﬂow-switched networks. This paper proposes a Maximum Probability (MP) method that estimates the length of the corresponding
original ﬂow from the length of a sampled ﬂow. This method is simple to calculate and easy to implement. The main contributions of this paper include:
1) Maximum Probability (MP) method that estimates the length of the corresponding original ﬂow from the length of a sampled ﬂow is proposed.

2) A linear expression that reﬂects the relationship between the length of
sampled ﬂow and that of the corresponding original ﬂow is obtained. Although
they are diﬀerent for diﬀerent Pareto parameters, the diﬀerences are very small.
3) We conclude that the value calculated by using the Pareto distribution
with 1.0 can be used to estimate original ﬂow length in the concerned network.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review some elementary concepts on ﬂow and sampling. In Section 3 we construct
the probability models of the original ﬂow length distributions of a sampled
ﬂow under the assumptions of various ﬂow length distributions, respectively.
In Section 4, we propose the Maximum Probability (MP) method and compare the estimating results of uniform distribution, Pareto distributions and
empirical distributions. We conclude with some a summary our contributions in
Section 5.

Some Elementary Concepts

There are a number of diﬀerent ways to implement this, e.g., independent sampling of packets with probability p = 1/N , and periodic selection of every N th
packet from the full packet stream. In both cases we will call N the sampling
period, i.e., the reciprocal of the average sampling rate. Although the length distributions by random and periodic sampling can be distinguished, the diﬀerences
are, in fact, suﬃciently small [2].
Deﬁnition 1. A ﬂow is deﬁned as a stream of packets subject to ﬂow speciﬁcation and timeout.
When a packet arrives, the speciﬁc rules of ﬂow speciﬁcation determine which
active ﬂow this packet belongs to, or if no active ﬂow is found that matches
the description of this packet, a new ﬂow is created. In this paper, the ﬂow
interpacket timeout is 64 seconds. A general ﬂow is a stream of packets subject
to timeout and having the same source and destination IP addresses, same source
and destination port numbers (not considering protocol). In this paper, we will
use the term original ﬂow to describe the above ﬂow. A ﬂow length is the number
of packets in the ﬂow.
Deﬁnition 2. A sampled ﬂow is deﬁned as a stream of packets that are sampled
at probability p = 1/N from an original ﬂow.

Probability Distribution of Original Flow Length

In this paper, sampling probability is p = 1/N . For a speciﬁc original ﬂow F ,
let XF denote the number of packets in F , YF denote the number of packets in
the sampled ﬂow from F . The conditional distribution of YF , given that XF = l,
follows a binomial distribution
P r[YF = k|XF = l] = Bp (l, k) =

l
k

pk (1 − p)l−k .

W. Liu et al.

For an original ﬂow F , let P r[YF = y, XF = x] denote the probability of XF = x
and YF = y, by the conditional probability formula,
P r[YF = y|XF = x]P r[XF = x]
P r[YF = y, XF = x]
=
P r[YF = y]
P r[YF = y]

and by the complete probability formula, we obtain:
P r[XF = x|YF = y] =

Uniform Distribution

Suppose original ﬂows lengths satisfy uniform distribution, that is, P r[XF =
k] = P r[XF = k + 1], for all k = 1, 2, · · ·. Moreover,

hence P r[YF = y] =

Bp (i, y) =
i=y

P r[XF = y]/p, so P r[YF = y|XF = x] = pBp (x, y) and we obtain the following
results:
Lemma 1. The probability that a sampled ﬂow of length k is sampled from an

Let a1 = Bp (l−1,k)
= 1 + (l−k−1)N
. For l ≤ kN , since a1 > 1, hence Bp (l, k) is
increasing as l increases. For l > kN +1, since a1 < 1, hence Bp (l, k) is decreasing
as l increases. At l = kN + 1, a1 = 1 means that Bp (l, k) is maximized at l = kN
and l = kN + 1. We have

Lemma 2. The probability P r[XF = l|YF = k] is maximized at l = kN, kN + 1.
It is increasing as l increases for l < kN + 1 and decreasing as l increases for
l > kN + 1.
3.2

Pareto Distribution

Assume original ﬂow lengths satisfy Pareto distribution. Its probability mass
function is
(3)
P r[XF = x] = βαβ /xβ+1 , α, β > 0, x ≥ α
where β is called Pareto parameter. Hence Equation (2) can be written as:
∞

Bp (i, y)βαβ /iβ+1 , y ≥ α

P r[YF = y] =
i=y

Lemma 3. Under the assumption that original ﬂow lengths satisfy Pareto distribution, the probability that a sampled ﬂow of length y(≥ α) is sampled from
an original ﬂow of length x is

P r[XF = x|YF = y] =

Maximum Probability Method (MP)

The purpose of the Maximum Probability method (MP) is to estimate the length
of the corresponding original ﬂow from the length of a sampled ﬂow. The point we
are trying to make is that MP estimates the length of the original ﬂow according
to maximum probability. MP contains three steps:
i) Computing probability. Given a sampled ﬂow with ﬁxed length k, compute
P r[XF = l|YF = k] for l = k, k + 1, · · ·.
ii) Finding maximum probability. Deﬁne mp = max{P r[XF = l|YF = k]}.
l≥k

iii) Estimating length. Let l = min{mp = P r[XF = l|YF = k]}, we write our
l

estimate of the length of the original ﬂow as l.
Below we apply the MP method to diﬀerent ﬂow length distributions.
4.1

Uniform Distribution

Let the length of original ﬂows be uniform distribution. By Lemma 2, we can
use MP to obtain a linear expression as
XF =

YF
p

(4)

where X F is the estimate of the length of the original ﬂow, YF is the length of
the sampled ﬂow, p is sampling probability. The estimates of the original ﬂow
lengths for p = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 are shown in Figure 1(a). From this ﬁgure we can
observe the linear relationship between the length of original ﬂow and that of
sampled ﬂow under uniform distribution.
4.2

Pareto Distribution

Let the length of original ﬂows be Pareto distribution. By Lemma 3, we can
compute the results with β = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, respectively, and obtain an expression that reﬂect the relationship between the estimated length of the original
ﬂow and the sampled ﬂow length as
XF =

YF
− n(p, β) f or YF ≥ 1/p
p

where X F is the estimate of the length of the original ﬂow, YF is the length of
the sampled ﬂow, p is sampling probability, n(p, β) is a positive integer involving p and β as deﬁned in following subsection. In Figure 1(b), with sampling
probability p = 0.1, and Pareto parameter β = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, respectively,
we can observe that, for a sampled ﬂow with ﬁxed length YF , X F is increasing
as β decreases. It is minimized at β = 1.5, maximized at β = 0.5 , medial at
β = 1.0. Though there are diﬀerences for diﬀerent parameter, the estimates show
very similar tendencies for all parameters. Therefore, we may conclude that X F
calculated by using the parameter β = 1.0 can be used as approximations under
unknown parameter values in the concerned network.
4.3

Finite Pareto Distribution

In the concerned network, due to constraint of measurement time, the lengths
and numbers of ﬂows all are ﬁnite. Let M denote the maximum original ﬂow
length in an original ﬂow distribution, the probability density function in Equation (3) is
P r[XF = x] = γ/xβ+1 , x = α, · · · , M.
(6)
where γ =

βαβ

, 0 < γ < 1. Equation (6) can be extended so that β can

M

βαβ /xβ+1
x=α

be extended to real ﬁeld, that is, β can be zero and negative. We call Equation
(6) extended Pareto distribution. For β = 0, Equation (6) is
P r[XF = x] = γ/x, x = α, · · · , M.

(7)

For β = −1, Equation (6) is
P r[XF = x] = γ, x = α, · · · , M.

(8)

Equation (8) is uniform distribution, therefore we call uniform distribution as
degenerate Pareto distribution.
We now consider how the ﬁnite constraint impacts the conditional probability.
Due to the constraint of ﬁnite number of ﬂows, the conditional probability in

Lemma 3 is written by
P rM [XF = x|YF = y] =

Bp (x, y)/xβ
M

Bp

(9)

(i, y)/iβ+1

i=y

Obviously P rM [XF = x|YF = y] = ρ(y)P r[XF = x|YF = y], where ρ(y) =

i=y
∞

Bp (i,y)/iβ+1

< 1 is a function with variable y. Hence, for a ﬁxed y, the above
Bp (i,y)/iβ+1

i=y

two probabilities are maximized at the same x. Therefore Equations (4) and (5)
are still valid, we rewrite them as consistent form
XF =

YF
− n(p, β) f or YF ≥ 1/p
p

(10)

where X F is the estimate of the length of the original ﬂow, YF is the length
of the sampled ﬂow, p is sampling probability, n(p, β) is a binary function with
variables p and β whose value domain is integer set. Here n(p, β) is a binary
function with variables p and β whose value domain is integer set. Function
n(p, β) has the following properties:
1) It is a monotone decreasing function on variable p, that is , for ﬁxed β, is
decreasing as p increases.
2) It is a monotone increasing function on variable β, that is , for ﬁxed p, is
increasing as β increases.
3)n(p, −1) = 0, for any p(0 < p < 1)
For example, n(0.1, −1) = 5, n(0.1, 0) = 10, n(0.1, 0.5) = 14, n(0.1, 1.0) =
18, n(0.1, 1.25) = 21, n(0.1, 1.5) = 23, n(0.1, 2.0) = 27, n(0.1, 3.0) = 36.
4.4

Comparing for Diﬀerent Distributions

We use six traces to verify the MP method. The ﬁrst three traces [5], all containing packets during a 10 minute period, were collected with a Dag3.2E 10/100
MBit/sec Ethernet card at the outside of the ﬁrewall servicing researchers at
Bell Labs via a 9 MBits/sec link to the Internet in May 2002. The other three
Traces, either of which contains packets during a 10-minute period too, were collected at Jiangsu provincial network border of China Education and Research
Network (CERNET) in disjoint time interval on April 17, 2004. The backbone
capacity is 1000Mbps; mean traﬃc per day is 587 Mbps. For each trace, we sample at p = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 respectively. Then we use MP to estimate the length
of original ﬂow. We ﬁnd the estimated lengths are very close at same sampling
probability for the six traces. For clear display, we only show the estimates in
three experiments at sampling probability p = 0.1 in Figure 2(a). As shown in
Figure 2(a), the estimates are very close.
Figure 2(b) illustrates the estimates for uniform distribution, Pareto distribution (β = 1.0) and Experiment 1(For ﬁrst trace, sampling at p = 0.1, then we use

MP to estimate the length of original ﬂow. Similarly Experiment 2 for the third
trace, Experiment 3 for the ﬁfth trace). We can observe that the estimates for
uniform are slightly big but the estimates for Pareto distribution with β = 1.0 ﬁt
those for Experiment 1 very well. From Figure 3(a), we can see that the estimate
results of several experiments all move up and down at the point of estimate for
Pareto distribution β = 1.0. Therefore we can use the Pareto distribution with
β = 1.0 as theoretical distribution of the three empirical distributions.
4.5

Diﬃculties and Applications

When we use MP to estimate the original ﬂow length of a sampled ﬂow, we must
ﬁnd the one that makes the probability maximized. However, the maximized
probability sometimes is still very small. For example, consider a sampled ﬂow
with length 10 at sampling probability 0.1. We calculate the probability by using
Pareto distribution with 1.0 to estimate its original ﬂow length. Figure 3(b)
displays the probability distribution of the original ﬂow length of the sampled
ﬂow. Within it we can observe that the probability at length 82 is maximized
with value 0.0147. Although 0.0147 is maximum value, it is too small. It reﬂects
the diﬃculty and uncertainty associated with an estimate. To improve certainty,
we can estimate the conﬁdence interval for original ﬂow length subject to interval
width (as small as possible). Suppose that the estimated length may fall into an

Estimating Original Flow Length from Sampled Flow Statistics

127

interval with width 70, we can sum for some values and obtain a maximum
probability P r[51 ≤ x ≤ 120|y = 10] = 0.800017. Therefore, we can use MP to
estimate the boundary of length for a speciﬁc ﬂow.

Conclusions

This paper proposes a naive method (MP) to estimates original ﬂow length from
the sampled ﬂow. For diﬀerent Pareto parameters, we obtain a consistent linear
expression that reﬂects the relationship between the length of sampled ﬂow and
that of the corresponding original ﬂow. In the concerned network, the length
distributions of ﬂows collected in any time interval do not satisfy Pareto distributions with ﬁxed parameter strictly, but they can follow a Pareto distribution
with parameter in interval [0.5, 1.5] approximately. The value 1.0 is the middle
value of interval [0.5,1.5] exactly. Theory analysis and experiment results show
that it is a reasonable choice using parameter 1.0 to calculate at the condition
of unknown parameter value.
