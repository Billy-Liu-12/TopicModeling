Abstract. Gene regulation plays a major role in the control of developmental processes. Pattern formation, for example, is thought to be regulated by a limited number genes translated into transcription factors
that control the diﬀerential expression of other genes in diﬀerent cells in
a given tissue. We focused on the Notch pathway during the formation of
chess-like patterns along development. Simpliﬁed models exist of the patterning by lateral inhibition due to the Notch-Delta signalling cascade.
We show here how parameters from the literature are able to explain the
steady-state behavior of model tissues of several sizes, although they are
not able to reproduce time series of experiments. In order to reﬁne the
parameters set for data from real experiments we propose a practical implementation of an optimal experimental design protocol that combines
parameter estimation tools with sensitivity analysis, in order to minimize
the number of additional experiments to perform.
Keywords: lateral inhibition, GRN, optimal experimental design, multicellular system.

Introduction

One of the most breathtaking processes in biology is the development of a complex creature. In a matter of just a day (a ﬂy maggot), a few weeks (a mouse)
or several months (ourselves), an egg grows into millions, billions, or, in the case
of humans, 10 trillion cells formed into organs, tissues and parts of the body.
So, the main question in developmental biology is to understand how do cells
arising from division of a single cell become diﬀerent from each other. The complexity of the process of pattern formation in developmental biology has been
dealt with by a number of researchers in the last decades (for reviews see [1]),
both topologically, studying the diﬀerent genes involved in the process and their
relationships, and dynamically, measuring and modeling the temporal behavior of those genes and their products. Diﬀerent simulation methods have been
applied to dynamical models of patterning, involving both ordinary (ODE) [2]

and partial (PDE) diﬀerential equations or discrete representations of the cells
as cellular automata, among others[3]. Initial models for pattern formation were
based on simple assumptions that were able to capture most of the relevant information for a given general question. Thus, it is worth noting the eﬀorts of
Meinhardt [4] and others [5] in order to unravel the general rules governing the
formation of complex patterns during the embryo development by using simple
although soundable mathematical models.
At times, high throughput studies can be also performed in order to obtain
time dependent qualitative information on the topology of the GRN. This type
of information can be processed by probability and statistical inference tools that
complement the verbal models deﬁned by the experimentalists and provide a ﬁrst
formal model of the network. However, if one is able to quantify the dynamical
information about the expression levels of diﬀerent genes, even at the level of a
few key genes by, for example, real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
experiments, global optimization protocols can be used to reﬁne the parameters
that describe the dynamics of the model.
In typical situations the modeller claims for experimental data that is scarce,
low quality and, more importantly in most cases, diﬃcult to obtain. How to
maximize the outcome from limited resources is the aim of this paper. Here we
present the implementation of a practical optimal experimental design pipeline
in a theory/experiment integrated fashion. We demonstrate the utility of the
protocol in the parameter estimation for one of the simplest models of pattern formation in biology, namely the Notch-Delta pathway for lateral inhibition
(LI). To demonstrate the implementation of the method, we work with ﬁctitious
RT-PCR experimental data obtained from known models of the Notch-Delta interaction, as the LI model occurs between partner cells in a tissue, which oﬀers
an extra challenge for experimental manipulation. However, the proposed protocol is completely general for a RT-PCR experimental setting in any biological
system that suits this technique.

Methods
Problem Statement

As outlined in the introduction, dynamical biological systems can be described
by a large variety of mathematical models. Here we will restrict ourselves to
models deﬁned in terms of ODEs. Following [6], the time evolution of a system
state of K species x(t, θ) ∈ RK is solution of this set of ODEs:
∂
∂t x(t, θ)

= f (x(t, θ), θ, u(t)).
x(0) = x0 .

(1)

Here θ∈RP denotes the parameters of the system, and u(t) is a vector containing
the input of the system. The L properties of the system yM (t, θ)∈RLi that can
be measured are described by an observation function g at time ti , i = 1, ..., N
(N is here the number of design points):

612

yM (ti , θ, u) = g(x(ti , θ, u)), i = 1, ..., N.
D

(2)

Li

The observations Y (ti )∈R , i = 1, ..., N are considered as random variables
and are given by
YD (ti ) = yM (ti , θ0 , u) +

i,

i = 1, ..., N,

(3)

where θ0 is the true parameter vector and i ∈RLi , i = 1, ..., N describes the
distribution error at time ti . We assume that the distribution of the noise (ob2
servation error) follows a normal law (where the variances σij
can be estimated
from repetitions of the experiments):
ij

2
∼ N (0, σij
), j = 1, ..., Li i = 1, ..., N.

(4)

In fact, yM (t, θ) refers to theoretical values (given by the model) and yD (ti )
(realizations of the random variables YD (ti )) refers to practical values (it corresponds to the Li measurements made experimentally at each time ti , i =
1, ..., N ).
Maximum Likelihood Method. This method will help us to get estimates of
the parameters of the system. In this method, we need to maximize the likelihood
function Jml (θ) to get estimates of the parameter vector θ. This function is
deﬁned as:
Jml (θ; yD (t1 ), . . . , yD (tN )) = f(YD (t1 ),...,YD (tN )) (yD (t1 ), ..., yD (tN )).

(5)

As deﬁned the random variables YD (ti ) follow a multivariate normal law
YD (ti ) ∼ NL (yM (ti , θ, u), C(ti )), i = 1, ..., N,

(6)

where C(ti )∈ML,L (R) is the covariance matrix deﬁned as Cll (ti ) = σil2 and
Ckl (ti ) = 0 if k = l.

Maximizing the likelihood function (regarding of θ) is in fact the same as maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood function, which in turn is the same as
minimizing the opposite of the logarithm of the likelihood function.So, this leads
to minimize the following function:
−ln(Jml (θ; y D (t1 ), . . . , y D (tN )) =

This corresponds to the minimization of a weighted residual sum of squares
(with weights: wij = σ12 ) to get the estimated parameters.At this point, we can
ij
compute analytically asymptotic estimates of the parameters θˆ and asymptotic
conﬁdence intervals. In this scope, we assume that we are in the case where
we have so much observations that the deviation Δθ between the real θ0 and
estimated parameters θˆ is small. Thus, we can expand the observation function
in a Taylor series:
yjM (ti , θ, u) = yjM (ti , θ0 , u) + ∇θ yj |ti ,θ0 (θ − θ0 ).

We insert this result in the function to minimize, and we get:

As we assumed that the residuals are independently distributed, the covariance
matrix of the estimated parameter vector is computed by (where the average is
over the repetition of experiments):
Σ =< ΔθΔθ T >= F −1 .

Thanks to this covariance matrix, we can see the correlation between the parameters. The correlation matrix is deﬁned by:

values on the model output. For instance, if two parameters are highly correlated,
a change in the model output caused by a change in a model parameter can be
compensated by an appropriate change in the other parameter value. This prevents such parameters from being uniquely identiﬁable even if the model output
is very sensitive to changes to individual parameters.
Then we can try to improve the information contained in the data by optimizing one of the criteria derived from Σ. We used the modiﬁed E-optimal design:

). As it minimizes the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue,
min( λλmax

it optimizes the functional shape of the conﬁdence intervals. All calculations have
been performed with ByoDyn (http://cbbl.imim.es/ByoDyn) most of them at
the QosCosGrid [7] environment.

The ODEs Model for the Notch-Delta System

In the model, two adjacent cells,i and j, initially expressing the the same amount
of the genesnotch and delta generate an asymmetric ﬁnal expression of the genes
by the lateral inhibition mechanism. The interaction of the protein NOTCH
with its ligand Delta activates the cleavage of the NOTCH intracellular domain
(NICD) by a γ-secretase. NICD activates the expression of hes5 and ultimately
downregulates delta. If one assumes in a very rough approximation that the
quantities of the diﬀerent species in the system are large enough to work with
concentrations, we have formalized the verbal model represented in Figure 1,
after adimensionalization by t = T0 τ and [x]i = [x]0 xi (τ ):

concentrations of the three genes in our model acquire the characteristic chesslike pattern represented in Figure 2, in which diﬀerent cell types are clearly
deﬁned. In addition, the ﬁgure shows the correlation matrices for the diverse
systems. It appears that the boundary eﬀect vanishes with bigger tissue sizes
and that the 5×5 cells model can be considered converged for the purposes of
this paper, as seen from the invariant correlation matrix when comparing the
5×5 and 7×7 systems. Thus, in the following paragraphs we will present our
protocol for experimental design based on the 5×5 tissue model.
Next, we consider a typical experimental setting in which RT-PCR experiments are carried out and provide time dependent data for each of the genes
involved in our model. We will generate hypothetical data from real experiments
of inner ear early development in chick[8]. In a typical scenario of the model,
4 tissue samples may be extracted at diﬀerent stages of development. For each
of them RT-PCR experiments may be performed, using three replicas for security, showing a behavior that in the best case will be just close to the simulated
concentration proﬁles from Eq. 16. The parameter set θ may then be globally
optimized with several methods. We use here a simple approach consisting on
local optimizations from 10 or 100 starting random values of θ with varying value
of σ 2 for the generated data points.
Once the ﬁtting parameters are obtained to some approximation, by using the
above detailed simple approach or by more sophisticated methods[9], we are interested in improving their conﬁdence intervals. This can be achieved, of course,

by choosing a better optimization algorithm or, complementarily, by using information theory in order to estimate what data will provide more information
to improve the parameters practical identiﬁability. This is extremely relevant as
new experiments can consume an important number of resources and even one
may decide they are not worth trying because of intrinsic identiﬁability problems
of the model. In order to learn about the information content of new data, we
generate in silico data at 200 time points through the total simulation time ttotal
using the parameters optimized in the previous step. We call this set θ . In a
leave-one-out fashion, each value is deleted at a time and the modiﬁed E-criteria
is evaluated for the remaining data, in order to discover the computer-generated
point, according to the current model (topology plus parameters) that contain
more information. Figure 3 shows the result of this approach for the two genes
of the system.
In the ﬁrst iteration of the protocol, the modiﬁed E-criteria suggests that
new values for the concentration of hes5 at time t = 1260 would be the most
informative. At this stage we measure new data for that gene at such time step
and we proceed the next iteration of the approach again. Such measurement in a
real experimental set up is simulated here by a new in silico value obtained with
or without noise with respect to the known model. Finally, Figure 4 shows the
evolution of the modiﬁed E-criteria for a number of iterations of the protocol.
It can be seen how the higher information content of the new experimental data
set (increased after each OED iteration) does not necessarily involves a better
(lower) value for the modiﬁed E criteria. This problem has multiple origins, being
the noise of the new data measured or the fact that the optimization method
does not ﬁnd the same minimum in each parameter estimation step.

Conclusions

Optimal experimental design has been demonstrated in a realistic example of
experiment /theory iterative protocol. In this paper, the experimental data is

indeed estimated from new calculations in order to show the general applicability
of the protocol, although its migration to real experimental setups is straightforward. The beneﬁts from using the proposed approach are clear, as the new
experiments to be carried out are decided from a predicted behavior of the modiﬁed E-criteria for a set of in silico generated data from the model from optimal
parameters from the previous step in the iteration. The proposed protocol provides an easy and neat method to incorporate experimental data, that may be
diﬃcult or expensive to obtain, in an informed way. At the same time it provides
clues about the identiﬁability of the parameters for the proposed model, according to the evolution of the modiﬁed E-criteria with the iterations of the OED
approach. Thus, one expects the modiﬁed E-criteria to approach the limit of 1
for a perfectly identiﬁable model if a big number of experiments is performed,
while reaching a diﬀerent limiting value is indicative of the unidentiﬁability of
the model. The protocol has been exempliﬁed on a hypothetical situation in
which a simple gene regulatory network includes three genes interacting in a
multicellular system. However, the data proposed, its distribution and the error
one performs in the experimental evaluations are realistic and match a typical
experimental setting. The next step is to apply this protocol to real data on a
more complex model like the regionalization of cellular systems during vertebrate
development[10].
Finally, the practical implementation of the protocol makes it suitable for
parallelization in several points, like the multiple optimization in each step or the
evaluation of the modiﬁed E-criteria itself for several time/species trial values.
