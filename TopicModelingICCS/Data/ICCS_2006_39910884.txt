Abstract. While heuristics based on geometric constructs of the networks would
appear to improve performance of Dijkstra’s algorithm, the fallacy of depreciated
accuracy has been an obstacle to the wider application of heuristics in the search
for shortest paths. The authors presented a shortest path algorithm that employs
limited area heuristics guided by spatial arrangement of networks. The algorithm
was shown to outperform other theoretically optimal solutions to the shortest
path problem and with only little accuracy lost. More importantly, the confidence
and accuracy levels were both controllable and predictable.

1 Introduction
Shortest path algorithms traditionally concerned topological or phase characteristics of
a network and neglect the spatial or proximity characteristics. Such a viewpoint has
resulted in a looping and radial approach to path searching which cannot prevent
redundant searching even in situations when the destination nodes have been located.
Some researchers have argued that the locational information (i.e. relative positions) of
nodes can be employed in heuristics to inform the searching process [1][2]. Heuristics
have been widely used in optimum path algorithms [3][4][5].
Most heuristics utilized local controlling strategies to guide the node search. They
were efficient in locating approximately optimal one-to-one shortest paths but could
not handle one-to-some or some-to-one shortest path problems.
The optimal path algorithms and heuristic strategies can be integrated to make a
trade-off between efficiency and theoretical exactness, which is especially important
for large-scale web applications or real time vehicular path finding. This paper
highlights advantages of the integration using real-world networks of different
complexity and connectedness.

data were edited to topological correctness and then transformed into some
custom-built ASCII files to store geometrical and topological information.

3 Search Heuristics Based upon Geographic Proximity
Our computation for the shortest paths used Dijkstra’s algorithm implemented with a
quad-heap structure. An ellipse based strategy is utilized to limit the searching within a
local ellipse or its MBR generated with the source and destination nodes. Detailed
description of the strategy can be found in [6].
3.1 Correlation Between Shortest Path and Euclidean Distance in Road
Networks
First, 1000 sample nodes were extracted systematically from each network to
reconstitute sets A and B, each containing 500 nodes. In the case of Alabama, all 952
nodes were used (Table 1). Every node in A or B would be regarded in turn as origins
and destinations between which the shortest paths must be determined.
A set R of ratios rab = pab/eab (eab: the Euclidean distance; pab: the shortest path
distance) could be computed for each sample set. In general, we could establish a real
number τ as the threshold value for the elements in R at a stated confidence level. A τ
value at 95 percent would imply 95 percent confidence that the shortest path for a pair
of nodes could be found within the extent built with the τ value. The τ values ranged
from 1.238 (Texas) to 1.585 (Utah detailed) which appeared quite consistent across the
networks.
3.2 Numerical Premise
We proposed the use of a minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of ellipse to limit the
search. Table 2 presented the average r-values against the 95 percent τ threshold of the
ten networks. We would attribute a larger τ for California because of its elongated
shape and Utah Detailed for its disrupted landscape. In other words, there is great
likelihood (i.e. at least 95 percent of the time) that we could locate the shortest paths
(SP) between any node pairs within the ellipse MBR. Our attempt to compare
success-rates of the elliptical versus MBR search limits showed that the MBR is
superior to the ellipse; the former had fewer SPs beyond bound.

The last two columns in Table 2 recorded that more than 99% of the shortest paths
could be identified within the limited areas. The higher confidence levels meant that the
limited search was extremely effective because solutions to shortest paths could be
found 99% of the time in one round of search. In other words, only a very small
percentage of the shortest paths (an average of 0.36% for ellipse and 0.19% for MBR)
would be found beyond the areas.

3.3 Establishing Accuracy and Computational Efficiency
Our experiment showed that very few shortest paths (i.e. an average of 0.074%) would
be mis-calculated with the ellipse MBR limitation (i.e. an average of 7.65% longer than
the actual shortest paths). The results indicated that the MBR method would not cause
excessive loss in the computational accuracy.
Another experiment was conducted to verify the computational efficiency of the
presented method for resolving the one-to-one shortest paths with the 1000 sample
nodes (all 952 nodes for Alabama). It showed that an average 26.68% saving in
computational time was realized with only minimal loss in accuracy (i.e. 0.074% of the
optimum paths would be 7.65% longer than the actual shortest paths on average). The
results were listed in Table 3.

4 Conclusion
The theoretically optimal solution and heuristic strategies could be integrated to offer a
reasonable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. The ellipse MBR method we put
forth allows users to solve the shortest paths for a stated confidence and in less time.
Our experiment showed that more than 99.8 percent of shortest paths could be found
within the proposed MBR along with 26.68 percent time saving on average, with an
average of only 0.074 percent of the optimal paths exceeding 7.65 percent of the
lengths of the actual shortest paths.
