Abstract. This paper is devoted to the solution of the time-dependent
Vlasov-Maxwell equations in singular geometries, i.e. when the boundary
includes reentrant corners or edges. Indeed, computing the electromagnetic ﬁelds in this case is a challenge per se, as these geometrical singularities generate very strong solutions in their neighborhood. Moreover,
they have also an inﬂuence over the solution of the Vlasov equation,
through the coupling. We propose here a method to solve this problem,
illustrated by numerical examples.

Introduction

The numerical simulation of charged particles beams or plasma physics phenomena requires methods of solution for the time-dependent coupled Vlasov-Maxwell
system. Within this framework, we developed a numerical method (see [1]), with
continuous approximations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, which is recommended
in order to reduce spurious oscillations. In addition, the time-stepping numerical
scheme, which is explicit by construction, can be solved very eﬃciently. Finally,
the conditions on the divergence of the ﬁelds are considered as constraints, and
are dualized, using a Lagrange multiplier, which yields a saddle-point variational
formulation.
In practical examples, the boundary of the computational domain includes
reentrant corners and/or edges (called geometrical singularities) that generate
strong ﬁelds. Hence, they require a careful computation of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in their neighborhood.
We developed a method (see [2]), the so-called Singular Complement Method
(SCM hereafter), which consists in splitting the space of solutions into a twoterm sum. The ﬁrst subspace is made of regular ﬁelds, and coincides with the
whole space of solutions, provided that the domain is either convex or regular.
So, one can compute the regular part of the solution with the help of an ad hoc
– classical – method [1]. The second one is called the subspace of singular ﬁelds,
and is computed with the help of speciﬁcally designed methods: they originate
from relations between the electromagnetic singularities and the singularities of
the Laplace operator.

As a ﬁrst attempt, the Singular Complement Method was constructed in a
divergence-free framework (cf. [2]). When the divergence of the electric ﬁeld no
longer vanishes, div E = f (t), with f = 0, a simple solution is to substract a
gradient, to reach the divergence-free ﬁeld
E˜ = E − gradφ.
Unfortunately, to determine φ, one has to solve the time-dependent (via the
data) problem
−Δφ = f (t) ,
which slows down drastically the numerical implementation.
To alleviate this drawback, we studied in detail diﬀerent splittings of the electromagnetic space, which could be used for the SCM (cf. [3]). In addition to the
divergence-free splittings, we propose new splittings, direct and possibly orthogonal, with curl-free singular ﬁelds, or with singular ﬁelds with L2 divergence,
etc.
As an important application – actually, the origin of this study – we present
the computation of strong electromagnetic ﬁelds, via the numerical solution to
the coupled, non linear, Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. In Section 2, we
recall Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and describe the SCM well-suited to this framework. Section 3 is devoted to the numerical algorithms. Numerical experiments
of the coupled Vlasov-Maxwell are presented in Section 4.

Vlasov-Maxwell Equations

Let Ω be a bounded, open, polyhedral subset of R3 , and Γ its boundary. We
denote by n the unit outward normal to Γ . The Vlasov equation models the
transport of charged particles, under the inﬂuence of an electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The Vlasov equation reads
F
∂f
+ v · ∇x f +
· ∇v f = 0 .
∂t
m

(1)

Above, the unknown f is the distribution function of the particles, f (x, v, t), v
stands for the velocities of the particles, m is the mass of a particle, and
F = e(E + v × B)

(2)

is the the well-known Lorentz force. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B
are solution of the Maxwell equations in vacuum

where c, ε0 and μ0 are respectively the light velocity, the electric and magnetic
constants (ε0 μ0 c2 = 1). The charge and current densities ρ and J have to verify
the charge conservation equation
∂ρ
+ div J = 0.
∂t

(7)

Let us assume for simplicity that the boundary Γ is a perfect conductor, so we
have E × n = 0 and B · n = 0 on Γ . These equations are supplemented with
appropriate initial conditions. Remark that the coupling occurs on the one hand,
by the right-hand sides of Maxwell equations, ρ and J , which are computed from
the solution to the Vlasov equation f (x, v, t), thanks to the relations
ρ=

f dv,
v

J =

f v dv ;

(8)

v

on the other hand, the electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B) determines the forces that
act on the particles via the Lorentz force F.
Geometrical singularities have no eﬀect per se on the regularity of the solution
to the Vlasov equation. Therefore, we resort to a particle method [4]: it consists
in approximating the distribution function f (x, v, t) by a linear combination of
Dirac masses in the phase space (x, v)
wk δ(x − xk (t))δ(v − vk (t)),

f (x, v, t)

(9)

k

where each term of the sum can be identiﬁed with a macro-particle, characterized
by its weight wk , its position xk and its velocity vk . This distribution function
is a solution of the Vlasov equation (1) if and only if (xk , vk ) is a solution of the
diﬀerential system:
dxk
= vk ,
dt
dvk
= F(xk , vk ) ,
dt

(10)
(11)

which describes the time evolution of a macro-particle k, submitted to the electromagnetic force F.
The system (10-11) can be numerically solved by an explicit time discretization algorithm. We used a leapfrog scheme which is well-adapted in this case.
Given a constant time step Δt, the particles positions are deﬁned at time tn =
nΔt and the particle velocities are computed at time tn+1/2 = (n + 1/2)Δt. We
refer the reader to [5] for more details. It is a classical approach in Particle In
Cell (PIC) approach.
Even if geometrical singularities have no eﬀect on the regularity of the solution
to the Vlasov equation, they have an inﬂuence over f , through the coupling,
i.e through the force F. Hence, the electromagnetic ﬁeld must be computed
accurately. To this purpose, the SCM was introduced in [2], ﬁrst for divergencefree problems.

F. Assous and P. Ciarlet Jr.

Let us present here a way to generalize this approach to Vlasov-Maxwell
problems. As we are interested in non divergence-free solutions, we will only
present the electric formulation. Details on the magnetic counterpart can be
found in [6]. Let us recall the deﬁnitions of the following spaces
H(curl , Ω) = {u ∈ L2 (Ω), curl u ∈ L2 (Ω)}
H(div , Ω) = {u ∈ L2 (Ω), div u ∈ L2 (Ω)}
H1 (Ω) = {u ∈ L2 (Ω), grad u ∈ L2 (Ω)} .
We deﬁne the space of electric ﬁelds E, called X,
X = {x ∈ H(curl , Ω) ∩ H(div , Ω) : x × n|Γ = 0} .
When the domain is convex, the spaces X is regular. That is not the case anymore
in a singular domain (see for instance [7]). Hence, one introduces the regular
subspace for electric ﬁelds (indexed with R )
XR = X ∩ H1 (Ω) ,

(12)

which is actually closed in X (cf. [6]), so that one is able to consider its orthogonal, and then deﬁne a two-part, direct, and orthogonal sum of the space. The
orthogonal subspace is called singular subspacs (indexed with S ). One can write
⊥X

X = XR ⊕ XS

(13)

Thus, one can split an element u of the space X into an orthogonal sum of a
regular part and of a singular part: u = uR + uS . We have now to characterize
the singular electric ﬁelds. Following [6], elements xS ∈ XS satisfy
Δ xS = 0

in Ω ,

(14)

xS×n|Γ = 0 .

(15)

Numerical Algorithms

The numerical method consists in ﬁrst computing numerically the basis of the
singular subspace. Then we solve the problem by coupling a classical method (to
compute the regular part of the solution) to the linear system, which allows to
compute the singular part of the solution.
To compute xS ∈ XS , we introduce its divergence- and curl-free parts vS and
lS , which verify the following Helmholtz decomposition
xS = vS + lS .

(16)

We also introduce sN and sP , the non-vanishing (singular) solutions of
ΔsN = 0,

ΔsP = 0

in Ω,

(17)

Vlasov-Maxwell Simulations in Singular Geometries

respectively with Neumann and Dirichlet homogeneous boundary condition. Assume that sN and sP are known, then one can use the singular mappings (see
[6]), to ﬁnd φS and ψS such that
−ΔφS = sN ,

−ΔψS = sP

in Ω,

(18)

still with Neumann and Dirichlet homogeneous boundary condition. Finally, one
obtains the singular basis functions xS of XS by the aid of the relations
vS = curl φS ,

lS = grad ψS ,

(19)

together with relation (16). Hence, the keypoint is to compute sN or sP . To this
purpose, there exists several methods ([2], [8], etc.). We recall here brieﬂy the
method we choose, the Principal Part Method (see [9] for details). Consider, for
simplicity reasons, a domain with one singularity. The Principal Part Method
consists in splitting sN in a regular part s˜N (which belongs to H 1 (Ω)) and a
known singular part sP
N
sN = sP
˜N .
N +s

Above, sP
N belongs to L (Ω) but not to H (Ω), and veriﬁes ΔsN = 0. One thus

computes, for instance by a P ﬁnite element method, s˜N by solving

Δ˜
sN = 0 in Ω,

∂sP
∂˜
sN
= − N on Γ,

(20)

avoiding thus mesh raﬁnement techniques.
One still uses singular mappings [6] to ﬁnd the singular ﬁeld φS ∈ H 1 (Ω) ∩
2
L0 (Ω) such that
−ΔφS = sN in Ω,

∂φS
= 0 on Γ .
∂νν

Again, one can split this ﬁeld in a regular part φ˜S (which belongs to H 2 (Ω))
and a singular part φP
S
φS = φ˜S + Cφ φP
S ,
where Cφ is a constant to be determined. The principal parts φP
S is harmonic
and does not belong to H 2 (Ω). Its analytic expression is known. The regular
part φ˜S can be computed easily, by solving a standard variational formulation.
The singular function sP and the singular ﬁeld ψS are computed in the same
way.
Then, using a ﬁnal time the singular mappings, one can compute the singular
electromagnetic basis functions. To determine the basis vS (resp. lS ), one simply
takes the curl of φS (resp. the gradient of ψS )
vS = curl φ˜S + Cφ curl φP
S ,

lS = ∇ψS + Cψ ∇ψ ,

and xS is easily obtained with (16). The singular constant Cφ can be computed
by using a formula derived from integration by parts (cf. [9]). As an example,
one gets
sN 2
.
Cφ =
∂φP
sN S dΓ
∂νν
Γ
Now, we have to modify a classical method by handling the decomposition (13).
We ﬁrst write Amp`ere and Faraday’s laws as two second-order in time equations.
To enforce the divergence constraints on the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we introduce
two Lagrange multipliers (say p for the electric ﬁeld), to dualize Coulomb’s
and absence of free magnetic monopole’s laws. In this way, one builds a mixed
variational formulation (VF) of Maxwell equations. For the electric ﬁeld (the
case of the magnetic ﬁeld is handled similarly), this formulation reads
Find (E, p) ∈ X × L2 (Ω) such that

To include the SCM in this formulation, the electric ﬁeld E is split like E(t) =
ER (t) + ES (t). The same splitting is used for the test functions of the variational
formulation, which is discretized in time, with the help of the leap-frog scheme.
From a practical point of view, we choose the Taylor-Hood, P2 -iso-P1 Finite
Element. In addition to being well-suited for discretizing saddle-point problems,
it allows to build diagonal mass matrices, when suitable quadrature formulas are
used. Thus, the solution to the linear system, which involves the mass matrix,
is straightforward [1].
Then, one can write down the discrete singular part as a ﬁnite sum. Assuming
again that there is one singularity, and let (xS ) be a given basis of the discrete
singular space. One has ES (t) = κ(t)xS , where κ is continous time-dependent
function. This results in a fully discretized VF:

Above MΩ denotes the usual mass matrix, and LΩ corresponds to the divergence
term involving xhR and the discrete Lagrange multiplier ph (t). Then, MRS is a
rectangular matrix, which is obtained by taking L2 scalar products between regular and singular basis functions, MS is the ”singular” mass matrix, and ﬁnally,
LS corresponds to the divergence term involving xS and ph (t). To solve this sysn+1
tem, one ﬁrst removes the unknown κn+1 , so that the unknowns (En+1
)
R ,p

can be obtained with the help of a Uzawa-type algorithm. Finally, one concludes
the time-stepping scheme by computing κn+1 with the help of (26).
For error estimates for the singular functions sN , sP and φS , ψS , we refer the
reader to [10] . As far as the electromagnetic sigular ﬁelds are concerned, error
estimates are provided in [3]. Let us brieﬂy recall that, using the electric ﬁeld
splitting
E(t) = ER (t) + ES (t) = ER (t) + κ(t)xS ,
one can prove, for a two-dimensional domain [11]
|κ − κh | ≤ Ch2α , ||E − Eh ||X ≤ Ch2α−1−ε , ||E − Eh ||2L ≤ Ch4α−2−ε ,
where π/α denotes here the reentrant angle of the non-convex domain Ω.

Numerical Experiments

We consider an L-shaped domain Ω, and assume its boundary is entirely perfectly conducting. Initial conditions are uniformly set to zero. A bunch of particles – electrons – is emitted from the top-most part of the boundary, with an
initial velocity equal to v = vy ey , with vy = −2.108 ms−1 . The electromagnetic
ﬁeld is therefore a self-consistent ﬁeld. Particles are absorbed at the down-most
part of the boundary.

Fig. 1. electric ﬁeld with (left) and without (right) SCM

As shown Figure 1 the electric ﬁeld – Ex component – obtained after 500 timesteps is very diﬀerent, when it is computed with and without the SCM. Recall
that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the result of the motion of the charged particles
only. Therefore, diﬀerences are entirely due to the coupling between the Vlasov
and Maxwell equations.

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a new scheme for the time-dependent coupled VlasovMaxwell system of equations, in domains with singular geometries. The numerical experiments we have shown and their performance, make the study of such
physical conﬁgurations possible.
