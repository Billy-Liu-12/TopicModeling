Abstract. The volatility of international capital flows have further increased
both in volume and speed since the outbreak of subprime crisis originating from
America. Orientation of international capital flows blurred because of the
downward expectation on the growth rate in main countries. Since the shortterm capital flow has gradually become an important part of international capital flow in China in decade, the volatility of short-term capital flows may affect
the development of Chinese economy severely. A structural model-VECM was
build to explore the determinants of net flows of short-term capital in China.
The conclusions of this study were that net flows in China are largely determined by estate price, circulated stock value, expectation on exchange rate and
interest rate. On that basis, some policy suggestions were proposed.
Keywords: short-term capital inflow, determinants, VECM.

1 Introduction
As the development of financial integration, the volatility of international capital
increased both in volume and speed, which should be viewed as a mixed blessing. On
one hand, the international capital flows have brought about advanced management,
technology and growth potential; and on the other hand, a surge in capital flows will
probably bring about some difficulties on monitoring and threat the development of
economy. The financial crises have always been related to periodic international capital flows and fluctuations. Specifically, short-term international capital, with high
fluctuations, may mess economy quickly. This is due to its variability, as the capital
coming in quickly can flow out just as fast.
Generally speaking, a loan or investment within a period less than a year is defined
as “short-term capital”, while over a year is known as “long-term capital”. However,
with the development of financial market and the innovation of financial instruments,
the line between “short-term capital” and “long-term capital” has blurred. In view of
the standards adopted by Balance of Payment and the relatively strict regulation on
international capital flows in China, we identify short-term capital as a combination of
portfolio investments, other investment flows (except long-term loans), and the partly
un-tracked implicit capital represented by errors and omissions.

Figure 1 shows both the absolute amount of capital inflows and outflows has
surged in decade, the ratios of short-term inflows to the total private inflows have
greatly increased while the ratios of short-term outflows to the total private outflows
are stable. CNY has appreciated gradually accompanying with a boom in housing and
stock market since the exchange rate reform in 2005. In the mean while, short-term
capital flow to China is on a large scale. Inflows of short-term capital raised inflation
pressure, which could influence the steady development of China.

China’s economy is facing new challenges in the global economy crises. Shortterm capital flow to China is under a pressure of outflow. In this circumstance, on the
basis of summarize the driving causes of net flows of short-term capital; empirical
study the determinants of capital flows in China in decade has significance.

2 Literature Review
Some studies focusing on the determinants of short-term capital flows have been
achieved. Most scholars classified the factors affecting capital flows into two categories, which are “pull factors” reflecting domestic opportunity and risk, and “push
factors” reflecting global change and influence. Schadler et al. [1] showed that pull
factors are more important. But Chuhan et al. [2] argued that compared with domestic
factors, global factors, such as a fall in US interest rates and the slow down in US
production were more important or at least as important. Chuhan et al further concluded that lower international interest could explain more than 50% of the capital
flowing to emerging countries. He also pointed out that compared with bond flows;
equity flows were more responsive to global factors; bond flows were more responsive to a country’s credit rating and the secondary-market price of debt. In-Mee Baek
[3] observed that portfolio investment in Asia was dominantly pushed by investors’
appetite for risk and other external factors, while in Latin American, it was pulled
mainly by rapid economic growth and global factors rather than the market’s risk
appetite.

Since China’s accession to the WTO, the studies focus on the determinants of
short-term capital flows in China was prevalent (Wang [4], Wang [5], Liu [6]).
Jiang [7] identified arbitrage as the primary determinant of short-term capital flows.
She also suggested that both financial innovation and development of capital markets
made transactional activities remarkably convenient. Wang(2003)[8], Liu and Wen [9]
analyzed the determining factors, such as interest rate, exchange rate, and assets price
employing OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)., Zhang, Pei, and Fang [10] analyzed inflows of short-term international capital employing a triple-arbitrage model. Lan and
Chen [11] counted the co-integration relationship among interest rate, exchange rate
expectation, and capital control, which indicated that the above-mentioned variables
are highly correlated.
Previous studies have made great progress in analyzing the determinants of capital
flows. However, there are still some topics need further discussions. First of all, there
are few studies concerning new features of short-term capital flows surge in China
after Southeastern Asian financial crisis. In addition, most studies applied multiple
regression analysis, which can not reflect dynamic progress perfectly. This paper will
use dynamic econometrics methods to identify the driving factors affecting short-term
capital flows in China. What’s more, quarterly data, rather than annual data, have
been adopted to enhance the frequency of empirical testing.

3 Determinants of Short-Term Capital Flows
Based on Mundell-Fleming Model, which is the extension of Interest Rate Parity
Theory, risk reward of arbitrage capital flows are defined as: p = rd − r f − Δ E
Where
rd

denotes risk reward pursued by arbitrage capital flows,
denotes domestic interest rates,

rd

denotes foreign interest rates,

P

ΔE

denotes static expected exchange rate.

The model indicates that the risk reward can be divided into two parts. One part is
interest difference, short-term capital always flow from countries with lower interest
to higher ones. Another part is reward from expected fluctuations in the exchange
rate. The mechanism is that the expectation on currency appreciation brings about
short-term capital inflows; correspondingly, the expectation on currency depreciation
brings about outflows. In view of Mundell-Fleming Model and costs of short-term
capital flows in China is high, we must consider real interest difference, which have
adjusted for inflation. The fluctuations of exchange rate may be another important
driving factor because the expectation on CNY’s appreciation has occurred since
2002, which may induce capital flow.
Short-term capital flows may aim at the revenue on the appreciation of real assets
and revenue on portfolio investment in considerate of China is undergoing the economic transform. Real estate price and circulated stock value listed on the Shenzhen
and Shanghai stock markets are adopted in this study as “push factors” proxies.

A dummy variable of policy is added in the model. China carried out reform on
currency exchange rate and established a managed floating exchange rate regime in
July 21st, 2005. Henceforth, the fixed exchange rate regime became flexible and marketization of CNY exchange rate mechanism has been speeded up.

4 Model-Building and Empirical Results
A quarterly model was build to examine the main driving factors in view of the complexity of the short-term capital flows. Vector Error Correction Model has been chosen
to ensure almost short-term fluctuations to be covered in. Furthermore, mechanisms of
reclamation from short-term non-equilibrium to long-term equilibrium were analyzed.
4.1 Data Specification
The interval for each variable is from the first quarter in 1999 to the fourth quarter in
2007. The data on net flows of short-term capital (SCF) is taken from Balance of
Payment for China in million-dollars, and the calculation formula for SCF follows the
former definition of short-term capital flows in section 1 (each item uses credit side of
figures).
The real interest difference between China and America is signified as RR. Threemonth deposit rate which originals from Reuters is substituted for the nominal interest
rate in China, while the nominal interest rate in America is signified as yield on threemonth Treasury bill on secondary market comes from the web of Federal Reserve.
The CPI in China comes from macro-economic warning system of People's Bank of
China. The CPI in America comes from the web of U.S. Department of Labor. RR
equals to the interest rate difference between China and America minus the CPI difference between China and America. Revenue on expected exchange rate is signified
e
e
as DE, DE = − E − E0 NDF is a proxy of E , which comes from Reuters; E0 is spot
E0
exchange rate, which comes from the web of The University of British Columbia.
Circulated stock value abbreviated as CSV, comes from database in China Economic
Information Network. The values at the end of each season are selected, and then
adjust to dollars according to the average exchange rate in the month. RE is housing
price index also comes from database in China economic information network. The
dummy variable of policy is signified as 0 before the second quarter in
2005(included) and 1 after the third quarter in 2005. D (SCF) is first difference value
of SCF, and more.
4.2 Tests for Stationarity and Johansen Co-integration Analysis
If two or more time series are non-stationary, but a linear combination of them is
stable, then the series are said to be co-integrated. The co-integration can be taken as
kind of long-run equilibrium. The co-integrated variables may fluctuate in the short
run, but in a long run, they can regress to their intrinsic relationship.

A test for stationarity must be implemented to assure the time series are stationarity
of the same differences before the co-integration analysis, in short, I (d). The ADF
test shows that all time series in this study are I (1) at 1% significant level.
We employ the Johansen co-integration analysis to test SCF and other time series
to identify the long-term relationships.

Table 1 shows a co-integration equation can be deduced at 1% significant level.
After normalized co-integrating coefficients, the equation is as follows:
S C F = 5 3 2 3 .4 9 9 R R + 1 1 5 2 8 .2 9 D E − 2 2 0 6 8 .0 3 C S V

[ − 3 .2 6 7 4 3 ]

The long-term relationships between short-term capital flows and the influence factors are shown in equation. T-tests are all significant. The results indicate that, RR is
in line with theoretical expectations, the symbol before RR is plus, high rewards of
domestic interest may attract arbitrage, and in the meanwhile, net flows of short-term
capital increase. The symbol before DE, which signifies the expected exchange rate,
is also plus, can explain the capital flows due to expected appreciation. The plus before RE shows that the net flows of short-term capital may increase along with ascend
of the housing price. The minus before CSV shows the negative relationship between
net flows and circulated stock value, which indicates the investors abroad mainly pay
attention to the appreciation on real asset.
4.3 Empirical Results
The co-integration can be taken as kind of the long-run equilibrium. On the basis of
co-integration vector, VECM model for SCF is as follows:
v e c m t − 1 = S C F t − 1 − 5 3 2 3 .4 9 9 R R t − 1 + 1 1 5 2 8 .2 9 D E t − 1 + 2 2 0 6 8 .0 3 C S V t − 1

Table 2 shows VECM model for SCF. Although some individual T-tests are not
significant due to insufficient data, excessive variables and weak degree of freedom, the overall results show that the selected variables are appropriate. The error
correction coefficient of SCF is -1.010483, with a significant t-value. The error
correction mechanism can be illustrated in the following way: In t-1 period, if
VECMt-1> 0, it implies that the net flows of short-term capital in that period are
more than long-run equilibrium level. Due to a negative adjustment mechanism,
when D (SCF) diminished, the net flows reduced in t period, the net flows regress
to long-run equilibrium level. If VECMt-1<0, adjustment can be similarly deduced
in opposite.
4.4 Impulse Response and Variance Decomposition
Impulse response and variance decomposition are used to examine the dynamic relationships among the variables and analyze the influences.
Figure 2 shows the responses of SCF when affected by other factors. When affected by a positive S.D fluctuation of RR, the fluctuation will have a positive
effect on SCF in the first phase, and a trivial negative effect in the second phase,
then a positive effect less than that in the first stage, finally gradually steady,
which imply the interest difference between America and China will induce net
flows of short-term capital in the beginning, and the effect will diminish gradually
in the long term. DE signifies revenue on expected exchange will also have a positive affect on SCF in the beginning, and then the signs alternate positive and negative, finally stable. A positive S.D fluctuation of CSV will induce net flows, and

the effect will diminish gradually. When attacked by a positive affect by RE, the
ascending assets price will induce capital outflow, then a larger outflow, finally
stable.
Decomposition of variance can further analyze the dynamic character in the model.
It is a method that decomposes the variance of endogenous fluctuations into
parts. The results are shown in table 3. The fluctuations of estate price account for
about 27% of the S.D fluctuations in SCF; interest difference account for about
25%; circulated stock value account for about 12%; expected exchange rate account for about 6%; itself account for others, which can be explained with inertia
effect and demonstration effect. In summarize, estate price, circulated stock value,
interest difference, and expected exchange rate are all factors affecting capital
flows in China.

5 Conclusions
Summing up the results of the empirical test, and taking the China’s short-term capital
movement characteristics and financial system into consideration, we conclude as follows:
First of all, net flows of short-term capital are affected by factors such as real interest difference, expected exchange rate, and estate price, which are all labile, rather
than fundamental economic factors. We once introduced variable GDP to reflect the
fundamental economic (including fundamental facility construction, the quality and
quantity of labors, and market prospects) in the model, which induce a remarkable
ascending in AIC and SC. The result indicated that short-term capital in China is
accompanied with arbitrage and speculation.
Secondly, the fluctuations of stock market and housing are the most important determinants in net flows of short-term capital. The fluctuations of stock market are
determinants, which reflect the arbitrage intention of short-term capital flows. But the

560

H. Yang, Y. Zhao, and Y. Ze

relationship between stock market and net flows is complex. Once the stock market
achieved high enough, the risk increased, and short-term capital may flow out, which
has indicated as a negative relationship in co-integration equation. The capital flows
are also affected by the estate price, which have also shown in impulse response and
variance decomposition. The fluctuations of estate price account for about 27% of the
S.D fluctuations in SCF, which indicated the capital flows speculating on housing.
These flows helped in pushing the ascending of housing in China.
Thirdly, the expectation on the CNY appreciation is an important factor affecting
net flows of short-term capital. The impact of expected exchange rate on net flows is
about 25% in variance decomposition. There is a stable long term positive relationship between the expected exchange rate and capital flows. The effect of expected
exchange rate is only about 6% in VECM, which is not large enough. But in considerate of the pressure from real interest difference, the effect may be larger.
In general, short-term capital flow mechanisms are complex. There has been a surge
in capital flow to China in order to speculation on interest, exchange rate, securities
and asset price. In this circumstance, strict supervision and control on the fluctuations
of exchange rate, as well as improvements in the CNY exchange rate regime are in
need. The government should also strength risk management in stock market; stabilize
housing market; further improve monitor on short-term capital flow; take precautions
against financial risks promptly; properly liberalize capital account prudently.
