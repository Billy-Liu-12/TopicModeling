Abstract. Spectral estimation has important applications to microarray time
series analysis. For unevenly sampled data, a common spectral estimation
technique is to use the Lomb-Scargle algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a
new reconstruction algorithm and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method
to deal with unevenly sampled microarray time series. The new reconstruction
method is based on signal reconstruction technique in aliased shift-invariant
signal spaces and a direct implemental algorithm is developed based on the
B-spline basis. We experiments on simulated noisy signals and gene expression
profiles show different effects for our designed three methods. The three
methods are based on our presented reconstruction algorithm, SSA, classical
FFT periodogram method and Lomb-Scargle periodogram method.
Keywords: Spectral estimation; periodically expressed genes; unevenly
sampled data; the Lomb-Scargle method; signal reconstruction; B-splines.

1 Introduction
Spectral estimation has been a classical research topic in signal processing
communities. Many approaches have been proposed in the past decades, including the
modified periodogram, autoregressive (AR) model, the MUSIC algorithm and the
multitaper method [1,2]. Although all these algorithms have their own advantages,
they are all developed based on a basic assumption: the input signal is evenly
sampled. However, in many real-world applications, the data can be unevenly
sampled. For example, in DAN microarray gene expression experiments, a time series
may be obtained with different time sampling intervals [3-5]. Furthermore, an evenly
sampled time series may contain missing values due to corruption or absence of some
expression measurements. A time series with missing values can be considered as one
with unevenly data samples in general.
Lu et al. [6] proposed a periodic-normal mixture (PNM) model to fit transcription
profiles of periodically expressed genes in cell cycle microarray experiments and
obtained some nice results. Ruf [7] is one of the first to treat evenly sampled gene
expression time series with missing values as unevenly sampled data for spectral

analysis using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Recently, Bohn et al. [8] have used the
Lomb-Scargle periodogram in their attempt to detect rhythmic components in the
circadian cycle of the Crassulacean acid metabolism plants. The Lomb-Scargle
periodogram was originally developed for analysis of noisy unevenly sampled data
from astronomical observations.
Although spectral analysis can be applied directly to the original data, noise and
outliers would degrade the final results. In DNA microarray analysis, a major
challenge is to effectively dissociate actual gene expression values from noise. As a
robust model-free technique in time series analysis, SSA can be used to extract as
much reliable information as possible from short and noisy time series without prior
knowledge of the dynamics underlying. It has been proven to be a powerful tool for
processing many types of time series in geophysics, economics, medicine and other
sciences [9]. SSA method was originally developed for analysis of noisy unevenly
sampled data from geophysical observations. We will introduce SSA method into
DAN microarray gene expression analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly
introduce SSA into DAN microarray gene expression data analysis.
In this paper, we propose a new spectral estimation technique for unevenly
sampled data. Our method models the signal in the aliased shift-invariant signal space
that is a generalization of shift-invariant signal space, for which many theories and
algorithms are available [10-22]. The proposed algorithm is also flexible in adjusting
the order of the B-spline basis based on the number of sampling points. We
experiments on simulated noisy signals and gene expression profiles show different
effects for our designed three methods. The three methods are based on our presented
reconstruction algorithm, SSA, classical FFT periodogram method and Lomb-Scargle
periodogram method.

2 Mathematical Theory and Algorithm
2.1 Reconstruction Algorithm of Signal in Aliased Shift-Invariant Signal Spaces
In the following, we first review existing work on signal analysis in the shift-invariant
signal space.
The space of a bandlimited signal is introduced, which is inspired by Shannon’s
signal sampling and reconstruction theorem:

V (sinc) = { f ( x) = ∑ ck sinc( x − k ) : (ck ) ∈ A 2 }

(1)

k ∈Z

where sinc ( x ) =

sin( x)
.
x

Since the sinc function has an infinite support and slow decay, it is not convenient
in real applications. Xian and Lin [21] found a good decay function that can replace
the sinc basis function, but the new function still has an infinite support. To replace
the sinc function with a general function φ , we can introduce a signal space that is
called the shift-invariant (also called time-invariant) signal space [10, 13-14,17-18].
Its aliased version is defined by

104

J. Xian, J. Wang, and D.-Q. Dai

VL (φ ) = { f : f ( x) = ∑ ckφ ( x − Lk ) : (ck ) ∈ A 2 }

(2)

k∈Z

where L > 0 is a constant.
Signal reconstructing in the shift-invariant space is an active research area and
there are many mathematical theories and computer algorithms on the topic [10-22].
When the signal f ∈ VL (φ ) , we hope to reconstruct signal f from sampled value

{ f ( xi )} , where {xi } is the sampling point set.
In fact, the well-known autoregressive (AR) model can be regarded as a special
case of signal reconstruction in the above signal space. Yeung et al. [23] have
presented an application of the AR model to microarray gene expression time series
analysis.
In order to avoid introducing spurious periodic components caused by basis
function φ with infinite support, for example, the sinc function, here we only
consider basis functions with compact support. The B-spline function is a good choice
and is widely adopted in the wavelet reconstruction theory. We use supp φ
indicate the support of basis function

φ

. Assume that supp φ

⊂ [−Ω, Ω] and

f ( x) ∈ VL (φ ) that is defined in finite interval [ A1 , A2 ] , then f can be determined
completely by the coefficients

Remark
(1) The construction of matrix

T has the advantage that it is a positive operator on

A ( Z ) [24].
2

(2) In the case of B-spline, that matrix

T is invertible under the condition that

sup j ( x j +1 − x j ) ≤

L( A2 − A1 )
A2 − A1 + 2Ω − L

(4)

That is, the Schoenberg-Whitney Theorem implies that T is invertible [25].
(3) Since the numerical solution of (ck ) could be sensitive to particular sets of
intersample spacings, we can approximate the inverse of the singular or illconditioned T by its pseudoinverse using singular valued decomposition (SVD).
2.2 Lomb-Scargle(L-S) Periodogram Method
In the following, we briefly give an expression of Lomb-Scargle periodogram
method. For a times series X (ti ) , where i = 1,2,", N 0 , the periodogram as a
function of the frequence

[

is defined as

and

N 0 − 1 i=1

The above Lomb-Scargle periodogram method gives superior results on unevenly
sampled data with classical FFT method: it weights the data on a “per point” basis
instead of on a “per time interval” basis. Lomb proved that his periodogram is the
same as the classical periodogram (see [26]) in the case of equally spaced data. But
since it assumes there is a single stationary sinusoid wave that has infinite support in
Lomb-Scargle method, it may introduce some spurious periodic components for finite
data. Also due to the effect of noise in the given data, it may produce inaccurate
estimation results.
2.3 Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) Method
Although spectral analysis can be applied directly to the original data, noise and
outliers would degrade the final results. In DNA microarray analysis, a major
challenge is to effectively dissociate actual gene expression values from noise.

106

J. Xian, J. Wang, and D.-Q. Dai

As a robust model-free technique in time series analysis, the SSA can be used to
extract as much reliable information as possible from short and noisy time series
without prior knowledge of the dynamics underlying [9]. The main idea of the SSA is
to perform singular value decomposition (SVD) of the so-called trajectory matrix
obtained from the original time series with subsequent reconstruction of the series. It
is aimed at an expansion of the original time series into a sum of a small number of
independent and additive components that typically can be interpreted as trend
components, oscillatory components and noise components. These properties make
SSA a useful technique for gene expression data processing. The SSA decomposition
into three parts is indeed related to the separation of the spectral range into three
regions: low frequencies corresponding to the trend, the higher frequencies describing
the oscillatory component, and the residual as noise. The Fourier analysis
demonstrates that the power spectrum of the expression profiles are dominated by low
frequency components. Therefore, SSA could be used to extracts the trend curve that
represents the dominative component in order to reduce the effect of noise, which in
fact is a process of data fitting. The detail of SSA can be found in [9].
2.4 Fisher’s Test
To search for periodic gene expression, a formal test should be carried out to
determine a peak in periodogram whether or not is significant or not. Fisher [7]
proposed a test statistic and derived the null distribution of the Fisher's G-statistic for
finite samples, and this is what will be utilized next. In the context of microarray gene
expression data, the observed significance value or p-value for the hypothesis testing
of the periodicity of a fixed gene g, using G-statistic as the test statistic, can be
obtained by explicit expression. The G-statistic value calculated from the Fisher's
G-statistic. So Fisher’s Test gives a p-value that allows to test whether a gene behaves
like a purely random process or whether the maximum peak in the periodogram is
significant. For details on the G test statistic, its null distribution and the percentage
points of the G test statistics, please refer to [27-29].

3 Experimental Results
3.1 Design of Experiment
In our numerical test, we choose B-spline of order N as the basis function
reconstruction algorithm. It is obvious that supp φ

L-S method can directly based on unevenly sampling data, but it may be deduced
by missing data and noise. Though SSA can be used to extract as much reliable
information as possible from short and noisy time series without prior knowledge of
the dynamics underlying, SSA are based on evenly sampling data. The classical
periodogram method also has the disadvantage. So we need a reconstruction data
from original raw unevenly signal for SSA and the classical periodogram method. We
adopt our presented reconstruction algorithm in Section 2.1.

3.2 Simulated Data
First, we use simulated data to test the proposed method with the three cases. For a
gene g and expression level observed at time t i , we denote the time series by Yg (ti )

i = 1,", N and g = 1,", G .
Yg (ti ) = β cos(

In the case of the simulated data, the length of a whole ideal time series (genes) is
evenly 48 points. That is, ti = i (i = 1,",48) .

First, we test a gene that presented in (6). We give a classical periodogram of 24
hours period cosine with evenly 48 sampling points as a standard contrastive figure.
Let FFT periodogram based on evenly sampling points be a standard periodogram
(See Figure 1(c)). Method III produces fewer and smaller false peaks than Method II
in Figure 1(e), (f). Method II produces fewer and smaller false peaks than Method I in
in Figure 1(d), (e). The peaks are highest among the three methods and closest the
standard (ture) peak value with Method III (see Figure 1(f)).
3.3 Genes Data
The gene expression for S. Pombe in [30] were gathered from three experiments.
Hence the data sets are called cdc25, elutA and elutB. In our test, we only apply our
methods to deal with the gene expression data from the cdc25 experiment.
From the Table 1, we observe that Method III can find more periodic genes than
Method I and Method II under the same FDR level threshold. The reasons are the
reconstruction algorithm repairing the missing data and SSA reducing noise. Because
the missing rate of cdc25 data is lower, the effect of Method I is almost as same as
Method II. We believe that the effect of Method II is better than Method I in a high
missing rate data.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we have proposed a new spectral estimation algorithm based on a signal
reconstruction technique in an unevenly sampled space. The new algorithm is flexible
since the order of the B-spline basis function can be adjusted. Experiments on
simulated signals and real gene expression data show that Method III
(ReconstructionÆSSAÆClassical Periodogram Method) is more effective in
identifying periodically expressed genes. Due to the limitation of eight pages, we omit
some simulated tests and real data tests.
