Abstract. We address the issue of modeling spot electricity prices with
regime switching models. After reviewing the stylized facts about power
markets we propose and ﬁt various models to spot prices from the Nordic
power exchange. Afterwards we assess their performance by comparing
simulated and market prices.

Electricity Spot Prices: Markets and Models

The deregulation of the power industry has given way to a global trend toward
the commoditization of electric energy. Electricity has transformed from a primarily technical business, to one in which the product is treated in much the
same way as any other commodity, with trading and risk management as key
tools to run a successful business [2,12,15]. However, we have to bear in mind
that electricity is a very unique commodity. It cannot be economically stored,
demand of end users is largely weather dependent, and the reliability of the
transmission grid is far from being perfect. This calls for adequate models of
price dynamics capturing the main characteristics of spot electricity prices.
The spot electricity market is actually a day-ahead market. A classical spot
market would not be possible, since the system operator needs advanced notice
to verify that the schedule is feasible and lies within transmission constraints.
The spot is an hourly (in some markets – a daily) contract with physical delivery. In our analysis we use spot prices from the Nordic power exchange (Nord
Pool) covering the period January 1, 1997 – April 25, 2000. The system price
is calculated as the equilibrium point for the aggregated supply and demand
curves and for each of the 24 hours [14]. Due to limited space, in this paper we
restrict the analysis to average daily prices. The averaged time series, however,
retains the typical characteristics of electricity prices, including seasonality (on
the annual and weekly level), mean reversion and jumps [20,21].
The seasonal character of electricity spot prices is a direct consequence of the
ﬂuctuations in demand. These mostly arise due to changing climate conditions,

like temperature and the number of daylight hours. In the analyzed period the
annual cycle can be quite well approximated by a sinusoid with a linear trend
[20,21]. The weekly periodicity is not sinusoidal, though, with peaks during the
weekdays and troughs over the weekends. Spot electricity prices are also regarded as mean reverting – for time intervals ranging from a day to almost four
years the Hurst exponent is signiﬁcantly lower than 0.5 [18,19]. In addition to
seasonality and mean reversion, spot electricity prices exhibit infrequent, but
large jumps caused by extreme load ﬂuctuations (due to severe weather conditions, generation outages, transmission failures, etc.). The spot price can increase
tenfold during a single hour but the spikes are normally quite short-lived [2,12,
15,21].
Now, that we have discussed the properties of spot electricity prices we can
turn to modeling issues. The starting point is the analysis of seasonal components. On the annual level this can be done through approximation by sinusoidal
functions [15,21], ﬁtting a piecewise constant function of a one year period [1,
13] or wavelet decomposition [18]. On the weekly (or daily) time scale, the seasonality is usually removed by subtracting an average week (or day) from the
data. Once the seasonal components are removed we are left with the stochastic
part of the process. In what follows we will analyze the logarithm dt of the deseasonalized average daily spot prices Dt , see the bottom panel in Figure 1. For
details on obtaining dt from raw data see [20,21].
The stochastic part dt can be modeled by a diﬀusion-type stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) of the form: dXt = µ(X, t)dt + σ(X, t)dBt , which is the
standard model for price processes of stochastic nature. Mean reversion is typically induced into the model by having a drift term µ(X, t) that is negative if
the spot price is higher than the mean reversion level and positive if it is lower,
like in the arithmetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:
dXt = (α − βXt )dt + σdBt = β(L − Xt )dt + σdBt ,

(1)

where µ(X, t) = (α − βXt ) is the drift, σ(X, t) = σ is the volatility and dBt
are the increments of a standard Brownian motion. This is a one-factor model
that reverts to the mean L = α
β with β being the magnitude of the speed of
adjustment. The equilibrium level L can be also made time dependent to reﬂect
the fact that electricity prices tend to revert to diﬀerent levels over the year.
The second main feature of electricity spot prices, the ”jumpy” character,
calls for spot price modeling which is not continuous. One approach is to introduce to eqn. (1) a jump component Jt dqt , where Jt is a random jump size
and qt is a Poisson variate [2,10]. After a spike the price is forced back to its
normal level by the mean reversion mechanism or mean reversion coupled with
downward jumps. Alternatively, a positive jump may be always followed by a
negative jump of the same size to capture the rapid decline – especially on the
daily level – of electricity prices after a spike [20,21].
Since spot prices after a jump tend to remain high for several time periods
(hours, sometimes even days) there is also need for models that are able to capture this behavior. The so-called regime switching models oﬀer such a possibility
and be discussed in the next section.

Regime Switching Models

The price behavior of spot electricity prices can be modeled by dividing the
time series into separate phases or regimes with diﬀerent underlying processes.
A jump in electricity prices can then be considered as a change to another
regime [4,8,9]. The switching mechanism is typically assumed to be governed
by a random variable that follows a Markov chain with diﬀerent possible states.
Thus, we have an unobservable variable in the time series that switches between a
certain number of states which themselves are driven by independent stochastic
processes [5,6,7,16]. Additionally we have a probability law that governs the
transition from one state to another.
2.1

Two-Regime Models

To introduce the idea of regime switching models we start with the simplest
model with two possible states. The two-regime model distinguishes between a
base regime (Rt = 1) and a spike regime (Rt = 2), i.e. the spot price is supposed
to display either mean reverting or jump behavior at each point of time. The price
processes Yt,1 and Yt,2 that are linked to each of the two regimes are assumed
to be independent of each other. The variable Rt that determines the current
state is a random variable that follows a Markov chain with two possible states,

862

M. Bierbrauer, S. Tr¨
uck, and R. Weron

Rt = {1, 2}. The transition matrix P contains the probabilities pij of switching
from regime i at time t to regime j at time t + 1:
P = (pij ) =

p11 p12
p21 p22

=

p11 1 − p11
1 − p22 p22

.

(2)

The current state Rt of a Markov chain depends on the past only through the
most recent value Rt−1 . Thus P {Rt = j|Rt−1 = i} = pij . The probability of
being in state j at time t + m starting from state i at time t is given by:
P (Rt+m = 1|Rt = i)
P (Rt+m = 2|Rt = i)

= (P )m · ei ,

(3)

where P denotes the transpose of P and ei denotes the ith column of the 2 × 2
identity matrix.
There are various possibilities for choosing the stochastic processes for the
base and the peak regime. However, considering the typical behavior of electricity
spot prices described in the previous section, we let the base regime (Rt = 1)
be governed by a mean-reverting process, eg. given by eqn. (1). In the spike
regime (Rt = 2) it may be interesting to try diﬀerent types of distributions for
the process Yt,2 . The Gaussian [9] and lognormal [20] laws were suggested in
the literature so far. In the latter case the deseasonalized log-price process dt is
deﬁned by dYt,1 = (c1 − β1 Yt,1 )dt + σ1 dBt in the base regime and log(Yt,2 ) ∼
N(c2 , σ22 ) in the spike regime. The parameter set θ = {c1 , β1 , σ1 , c2 , σ2 , p11 , p22 }
can be estimated using the so-called EM algorithm [3].
2.2

Alternative Regime Switching Models

Clearly the variety of regime switching models is due to both the possibility of
choosing the number of regimes (2, 3, etc.) and diﬀerent stochastic process for
the price in each regime. Especially for the spike regime it may be interesting to
choose alternative distributions. Since spikes happen very rarely but usually are
of great magnitude the use of heavy-tailed distributions should be considered.
We therefore suggest the use of the Pareto distribution (see e.g. [11]) for the spike
regime. Also the process that switches between a certain number of states should
be chosen in accordance with the typical behavior of spot electricity prices.
Huisman and Mahieu [8] propose a regime switching model with three possible regimes. The idea behind their speciﬁcation diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
previous two-state models. They identify three possible regimes: (i) the regime
Rt = 1 modeling the ”normal” electricity price dynamics, (ii) an initial jump regime Rt = 2 for a sudden increase or decrease in price, and (iii) a regime Rt = 3
that describes how prices move back to the normal regime after the initial jump
has occurred. This deﬁnition implies that the initial jump regime is immediately
followed by the reversing regime and then moves back to the base regime. Thus
we get a 3×3 transition matrix with only four non-zero values: p11 , p12 = 1−p11 ,
p23 = 1, and p31 = 1.

863

Furthermore, Huisman and Mahieu [8] suggest to model the base and reversing jump regimes by a mean reverting process and the initial jump regime by
Brownian motion (i.e. a process with increments given by a Gaussian variate).
However, we do not see the need for modeling the reversing jump regime with a
mean reverting process. The process automatically leaves this regime after one
time period and it seems that a Gaussian or a lognormal random variable will
do the job as well. The direction of the initial jump is not speciﬁed; it can be
either an upward or a downward jump. However, we restrict the model so that
the reversal jump, on average, is opposite to the initial jump. Hence, our threeregime model is deﬁned by dYt,1 = (c1 − β1 Yt,1 )dt + σ1 dBt in the base regime,
log(Yt,2 ) ∼ N(c2 , σ22 ) in the initial jump regime and log(Yt,3 ) ∼ N(−c2 , σ22 ) in the
reversing jump regime. In contrast to the two-regime models, the three-regime
model does not allow for consecutive spikes (or remaining at a diﬀerent price
level for two or more periods after a jump). In the next section we will compare
estimation and simulation results of diﬀerent regime switching models.

Empirical Analysis

In this section we analyze and model the logarithm dt of the deseasonalized
average daily spot prices from the Nord Pool power exchange since January 1,
1997 until April 25, 2000. For details on obtaining dt from raw data see [20,21].
As we can see in Figure 1, the data exhibits several extreme events that can be
considered as spikes. While most spikes only last for one day there are periods
where the prices exhibit three or more extreme events in a row, a behavior
that could be considered as consecutive spikes, see the top panel in Figure 2.
This is the motivation for ﬁtting the two-regime models with the base regime
dynamics given by dYt,1 = (c1 − β1 Yt,1 )dt + σ1 dBt and the dynamics in the spike
regime following a normal, a lognormal or a Pareto distribution, see Section 2.1.
For comparison, we also ﬁt the three-regime model described in the previous
section.
The estimation results are summarized in Table 1. In all models, the probability of remaining in the base regime is quite high: in the two-regime model we get
p11 = 0.9800 for the normal and lognormal model speciﬁcations and p11 = 0.9860
for the Pareto speciﬁcation. For the three-regime model we get an extremely low
probability of leaving the base regime p11 = 0.9924. However, while in the threeregime model the price level immediately returns to the mean-reversion process
after a jump, estimating the two-regime model we ﬁnd p22 = 0.6325 for the
normal, p22 = 0.6337 for the lognormal, and p22 = 0.5497 for the Pareto model.
Thus, in all three models the probability of staying in the spike regime is quite
high, see also Figure 2. The data points with a high probability of being in the

jump regime (P {Rt = 2} > 0.5) tend to be grouped in blocks in the two-regime
models. Due to model speciﬁcations, in the three-regime model the probability
of remaining in the second regime is zero.
Considering the unconditional probabilities we ﬁnd that there is a 5.16%,
5.12% and 3.01% probability of being in the spike regime for the Gaussian, lognormal and Pareto two-regime models, respectively. This value is substantially
larger than the probability of a jump in the three-regime model which is approximately equal to P (R = 2) = P (R = 3) = 0.75%. Surprisingly, the normal
and lognormal distributions produce almost identical results. A closer inspection of the parameter estimates uncovers the mystery – with such a choice of
parameter values the lognormal distribution very much resembles the Gaussian
law. However, using a heavy-tailed distribution, like the Pareto law, gives lower
probabilities for being and remaining in the spike regime and a clearly higher
variance.
Simulated price trajectories were used to check for similarity with real prices
and stability of results. Reestimating the models with simulated data led to
only slightly biased estimates for the parameters. Sample trajectories for the
two-regime model with lognormal and Pareto spikes can be found in Figure 1.
The trajectories of both models show strong similarity to real price data. We also
checked the simulation results considering spikes as the most particular feature
of electricity spot prices, see Table 2. Deﬁning a spike as a change in the logprices that is greater than 0.3 – either in positive or negative direction – we
ﬁnd that the regime switching models produce more spikes than there could be
observed in real data. Especially in the two-regime model the number of spikes
in simulations is about twice the number that was observed in the considered
period. While the number of extreme events are overestimated in all models (see
the values of q0.99 and q0.995 in Table 2), the magnitude of the largest spike
in either direction is underestimated in the normal and lognormal models and
overestimated by the Pareto distribution. This may suggest the use of alternative
heavy-tailed distributions, e.g. a truncated Pareto or a stable distribution with
parameter α > 1 [17] for the spike regime.

Conclusions

This paper addresses the issue of modeling spot electricity prices. For the deseasonalized log-prices dt we propose diﬀerent regime switching models, which
exhibit mean reversion and jump behavior.
We ﬁnd that the models produce estimates for transition probabilities that
can be interpreted according to market behavior. Simulated trajectories show
high similarity with real price data. However, we ﬁnd that the number of price
spikes or extreme events produced by simulations of the estimated models is
higher than what could be observed in real price data. This is especially true for
the two-regime models where consecutive spikes have a higher probability than
in the three-regime model.
