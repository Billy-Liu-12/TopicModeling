formulation has been compared with another approach based on explicit network flow solution
with reasonable qualitative [10] and even qualitative results [2].
On the other hand, a single-compartment approach on rigid geometry has also been used
in modeling [1]. The argument for even further simplification is that perfusion takes place only
around 0.5s during the diastole phase, when the heart can be considered steady.
Here we propose to model the perfusion process by a one-dimensional flow in rigid vessels.
This process takes place in a artery tree which is truncated before the capillary level. The
output of this model is coupled to stochastic dynamics which is constructed in such a way that
it captures both the transport through capillaries and the processes in the extravascular region.
The main advantage of such an approach is relative simplicity of adding additional factors like
reaction terms for contrast dynamics, boundary conditions as well as anisotropy of the medium.
We will use an ensemble of stochastic ”tracer” particles to obtain the final state of the perfusion
process. The simulation of particles will be accelerated using GPU processors.

The model

The main component of the model is the generation of an atrificial fractal tree resembling a
real network of coronary vessels. Then we compute the blood flow in that tree and finally we
use stochastic particles which reflect the last two stages of perfusion.
In the computed tomography (CT) only vessels down to about 0.5mm can be resolved. This
means that the CT of a patient only provides information about highest hierarchy of the vessel
network.
In the order to compensate for the missing smaller vessels we employ fractal approaches as
described by Szczerba at al. [9, 8]. Using the Murray’s law and statistical distributions of angles
and radii available in the literature we take the real geometry extracted from the tomography
and enhance it with the invisible lower grade vessels. We solve for the flow conditions in such
a structure using techniques from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The details of the
approach can be found in [9, 8].
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) have proven to be a very effective tool for different kinds
of simulation, both particle-based like Molecular Dynamics (MD) and stochastic dynamics as
well as lattice-based as Lattice Boltzmann Method [3], or based on partial differential equations.
Remarkably large speedups have been demonstrated for solving stochastic differential equations
(SDE) [4, 7]. Here, we propose to apply this technique to modeling transport processes during
perfusion.
It is known that stochastic dynamics can be used to simulate diffusion problems. Assuming
the isotropic and homogeneous in space diffusion constant D one can write a system of stochastic
differential equations:
x˙ =

√

2Dξ(t)

(1)

where x = x(t) is a particle position, ξ is a delta correlated white Gaussian noise. Thus
instead of solving a partial differential equation one can simulate large enough number of
realizations of SDE (eq. 1) and estimate required quantities. It remains the question whether it
is computationally better to simulate particles or distributions. Clearly, the numerical solution
od the PDE gives noise free quantities. However, it is a boundary problem, which requires to
use a mesh which resolves all details of the underlying geometry. On the other hand, mesh-free
particle simulations are straightforward to implement but have the inherent disadvantage of
providing only statistical information on quantities. Particle simulation directly benefits from

GPU architectures, as the realizations of (eq. 1) are independent on each computing core and
can be performed in parallel. Therefore, we have implemented this part in our perfusion model.
In this paper we limit ourselves only to a toy-model and proceed as follows. The last branch
of the vessel tree is assumed to be arterioles. Closing points of arterioles are points where
the blood enters the capillaries where the oxygen is ultimately released by red blood cells and
diffused into the surrounding muscular tissue of the heart. The transport in capillaries can
already be modeled by the stochastic dynamics. In capillaries the particles are advected to
the nearest venule. Since we do now known their position we further simplify our model by
assuming that this process can be replaced by setting initial conditions for particles according
to some Gaussian distribution which represents the distribution of points where oxygen or
contrast marker enters the extravascular region. Then, we proceed with stochastic dynamics
which models the diffusion of oxygen or contrast marker outside of capillaries. In this work we
perform simulation for some time and estimate the spatial density of particles. This case is
closest to a scenario of marker dynamics during the myocardial perfusion imaging[6].

Results

We have used a model including the generation of an artificial arterial structure. Having the
whole geometry of a vessel structure, we can investigate the influence of stenosis of selected
arteries on oxygen delivery to the tissue.
As a result of the fractal generation we have obtained a vessel tree, which is presented in
the figure 1. In this picture the radii of all the branches of the tree are indicated. The form
of the resulting vessel structure can also be noticed in this figure. Two branches on the top of
the figure are the initial branches for the fractional simulation. In this simulation each vessel
is divided into at most two further arteries with smaller radii, as long as the radius of the
vessel reaches a specified minimal value. This algorithm is reflected in the arrangement of the
generated vessels.
First we calculated the flow in the network of vessesel (1) assuming free outflow and equal
pressure at the terminal vessels. Then we simulated stenosis conditions by restricting completely
the flow in one of main branches - see the arrow in figure 1.
Vessels at the lowest level of the tree represent the arterioles. The next hierarchy level is
capillaries which deliver the oxygen to the tissue. In this approach we assume that the capillaries are on average isotropically distributed around each arteriole’s exit. Thus we include
the effective transport of the red blood cell in capillaries in the initial condition of the particle
model. The number of particles which started from vicinity of a given arteriole’s end was proportional to its outflow. Eventually we have performed the diffusion simulation which reflected
the oxygen distribution in the tissue.
We present the estimated spatial density of particles in non-stenosed and stenosed arterial
tree in figure 2. It can be seen that certain regions of the muscle are depleted of oxygen.

Discussion and outlook

Our approach can be further used for patient specific perfusion simulation. In the first step the
computed tomography provides images of largest coronary arteries. They are segmented and
used as initial condition for the fractal generation of the complete coronary arterial tree down
to the capillary level. Then the smallest diameter representing arterioles becomes the initial
condition for stochastic dynamics which completes the model.

Figure 1: The fractional tree representing the structure of the vessel network. The two most
top branches are the initial ones. The colors represents the radii of the different levels of the
tree. The radii are normalized to the radius of the two root branches. It can be noticed that
subsequent levels have smaller vessel diameters. The red arrow denotes the place where the
stenosis takes place.
There are many places where the model presented in this paper can be improved. The fractal
tree has to be generated in the confined geometry of a studied organ e.g. here, myocardium.
To this end we have to relate the model parameters and distributions of radii and angles as
well as bifurcation probabilities etc. to the real cases obtained e.g. from high precision imaging
like electron microscopy. The ultimate goal is to approximate the patient’s specific oxygenation
map of the heart muscle. The network model must also incorporate the Fahraeus-Lindqvist
effect, straightforward to implement in our framework, since it can include effective viscosities
of the smallest vessels.
