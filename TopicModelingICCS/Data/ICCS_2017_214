Ibbotson and Kaplan 2000). Their empirical results highlighted the importance of asset allocation. The
main purposes of this paper are: (i) review international experiences of pension fund asset allocation;
(ii) empirically allocate asset classes for pension fund of China.
In this paper, we first review some important aspects of asset allocation for some typical large
Social Security Reserve Funds (SSRFs) in the world in Section 2. We then present methodology used
in this paper: the mean-variance model with CVaR constraints in Section 3. Concerning the real
circumstance in China, we discuss the return and risk characteristics of four asset classes: stock, equity
investment, fixed income and cash in Section 4. Regulation constraints of investment weights for each
asset class are also discussed. In Section 5, we apply the mean-variance model with CVaR constraints
to asset allocation for pension fund of China. The empirical results show that to maintain purchase
power of pension fund, certain proportion should be invested in stock as well as equity investments.
Section 6 summarized the paper.

2 International Experiences
This section reviews some important aspects including investment objective, risk policy and asset
allocation for typical large Social Security Reserve Funds (SSRFs) in the world.
Currently, Social Security Reserve Funds adopt professional investment management combined
with “Pay-As-You-Go” system. However, focuses vary across different nations. Pension funds
without specific investment objective and risk policy usually imply more strict risk policy. Thus, their
required investment return is accordingly lower with narrower investment scope, which leads to easier
asset allocation process. US Social Security Trust Fund and Social Security Reserve Fund of Spain fall
in this category. On the contrary, pension funds such as Government Pension Investment Fund of
Japan, National Pension Fund of Korea, and Canada Pension Plan have specific investment objective
and risk policy. They have looser risk policy, wider investment scope, thus require more complex
asset allocation processes. They usually aim to acquire real return over inflation to preserve and
increase fund value.
We present investment objective and risk policy for the five typical pension fund in Table 1.

3 The Mean-Variance Model with CVaR Constraints
3.1 The Mean-Variance Model
Assume there are n asset classes in total that are normally distributed: r

N ( , ) , where:

is

an n -dimensional vector of expected return for asset classes;
is the corresponding (n n) dimensional covariance matrix.
n
Therefore, W {w :
wi 1} represents all the feasible portfolios expressed as a weight
i
vector of fractions invested in the different asset classes.
Under assumption of normal distribution, the overall portfolio return rw is also normally
distributed as shown in Equation (1).

where

3.2 The CVaR Constraints
Under the original Markowitz mean-variance framework, when introducing risk-free rate, efficient
frontier for investors becomes a straight line, i.e. capital market line (CML). The CML is tangent to
the efficient portfolio frontier given by Equation (3). Investors’ risk tolerance can be determined by a
questionnaire. An indifferent curve that is tangent to the CML finally determines the optimal asset
allocation for the specific investor’s portfolio. Individual investors’ risk tolerance is somehow easy to
be determined by the questionare. However, this is not the case for institutional investors.
This section discusses the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint as a risk budget on the
investment set of a Markowitz investor, specifically for institutional investors.
Under the assumption of normally distributed returns, the VaR of confidence level v(rw , ) can
be expressed in terms of a critical return level as shown in Equation (4).

v(rw , )
where z

( ) is the inverse of cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution.

Accordingly, the critical CVaR (rw , ) can be formulated as follows in Equation (5).

Obviously, we can see that given the confidence level

4 Return and Risk Characteristics of Asset Classes
In this section, we estimate and calculate return and risk characteristics of four asset classes: stocks
(in secondary market), (direct) equity investment, fixed income and cash.
Return and risk characteristics of different asset classes are in term of means and standard
deviations, respectively, as shown in Table 2.

5 Pension Fund Asset Allocation Practice
We adopt a very conservative risk policy, i.e at 90% confidence level, CVaR should surpass
predefined minimum return. In this section, we present two alternative choices of time horizon: 3
years and 5 years. Accordingly, minimum returns are 3-year treasury yield (2.86% annualized) and 5year treasury yield (2.941%).
If our time horizon is 3 year, then the annualized minimum return is 2.86%. In Figure 1, the blue
line presents the mean-variance efficient frontier with weights constraints, while the red line is the risk
budget of CVaR surpasses minimum return at 90% confidence level.

Given the optimal weights, we run Monte Carlo simulation to get the hypothetical portfolio return

If our time horizon is 5 year, then the annualized minimum return is 2.941%. In Figure 2, the blue

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we review some important aspects of asset allocation for some typical large Social
Security Reserve Funds (SSRFs) in the world. Focuses vary across different nations. Pension funds
without specific investment objective and risk policy usually imply more strict risk policy. On the
contrary, some other pension funds have specific investment objective and risk policy. They have
looser risk policy, wider investment scope, thus require more complex asset allocation processes.
We present the mean-variance model with CVaR constraints, and apply the model to asset
allocation for pension fund of China. The empirical results show that to maintain purchase power of
pension fund, certain proportion (more than 30%) should be invested in stock as well as equity
investments. We also find that time horizon significantly influence asset allocation of pension fund. If
time horizon is longer, more allocation to stock and equity investments help the pension fund to
achieve better performance.
