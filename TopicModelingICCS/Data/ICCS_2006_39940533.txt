Abstract. A global sea-ice modeling component of the Community
Climate System Model was augumented with automatic diﬀerentiation
(AD) technology. The numerical experiments were run with two problem
sets of diﬀerent grid sizes. Rigid ice regions with high viscous properties
cause computational diﬃculty in the propagation of AD-based derivative
computation. Pre-tuning step was required to obtain successful convergence behavior. Various thermodynamic and dynamic parameters were
selected for multivariate sensitivity analysis. The major parameters controlling the sea-ice thickness/volume computation were ice and snow densitives, albedo parameters, thermal conductivities, and emissivity constant. Especially, the ice and snow albedo parameters are found to have
stronger eﬀect during melting seasons. This high seasonal variability of
the thermodynamic parameters underlines the importance of the multivariate sensitivity approach in global sea-ice modeling studies.

Introduction

The Community Climate System Model (CCSM, see www.ccsm.ucar.edu) is a
fully-coupled, global climate simulation model developed by NCAR and DOE.
It provides the capbility to simulate the interconnected Earth’s climate systems including the atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea-ice. The parameterization
schemes of the CCSM model involve a number of adjustable modeling parameters
with diﬀerent scales of uncertainty. This impedes new parameterization schemes
since the entire model must be tuned with each new parameterization scheme.
Furthermore, current sensitivity analysis and parameter tuning experiments of
the CCSM model are performed by slow and labor-intensive approach:“expert
judgement” of a handful of scientists. Against this background, the sensitivityenhanced CCSM simulation approach for the global sea-ice modeling component,
CICE was implemented with the AD method. This AD-based approach allows
the derivative-enhanced CICE code to simultaneouly compute analytical derivatives in addition to original simulation results.
The modeling outputs of the CICE code are the global sea-ice conditions such
as ice thickness, compactness, and horizontal velocity [3]. Thermodynamic, dynamic mass and energy balances coupled with transport equations are used to

derive the CICE modeling formulation. There were many early sensitivity studies to see the impact of parameter changes on simulation results. These include
the works of Parkinson and Washington [6], Harder and Fischer [2], and Miller at
al. [5]. From these studies, it was concluded that sea-ice modeling parameters are
strongly interdependent and an objective computational scheme for tuning modeling parameters is a critical step in improving the sea-ice model development. In
this paper, we used the AD source code transformation package TAPENADE [4]
developed by the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science
and Control (INRIA) to investigate the parameter sensitivities of the CICE
model. This study was intended to help climate modelers objectively identify
important modeling parameters and further use the AD-computed sensitivities
as parameter tuning guide. Following a brief discussion of the model and the
TAPENADE-based implementation, we discuss the numerical experiments and
conclude with a brief summary.

Model Description

The major components of the CICE model are the thermodynamics, dynamics,
and horizontal transport routines, solving the snow and ice physical status. The
governing equations for each modeling component are solved on a generalized
orthogonal grid by using an explicit time-step procedure. We summarize the
main elements of the formulation here to identify the parameters used in the
numerical sensitivity experiments. A complete description can be found in the
user’s manual of the CICE model [3]. Selected parameters for the sensitivity
study are listed in Table 1.
2.1

Thermodynamic Parameters

The thermodynamic portion of the model determines the temperature proﬁle
and thickness changes of ice and snow based on an energy balance of radiative,
turbulent, and conductive heat ﬂuxes in each grid cell. For the energy ﬂux from
the atmosphere to the ice, the incoming shortwave ﬂux is computed as function of α, the shortwave albedo, and i◦ , the fraction of absorbed shortwave ﬂux
penetratting into the ice. Outgoing longwave radiation takes the standard black4
body form, FL↑ = − σ (Tsf ) , where is the emissivity of snow or ice, σ is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and Tsf is the surface temperature. The minimum
wind speed parameter, umin , is used to maintain ﬁnite sensible and latent heat
ﬂuxes for the situation of no wind. The net absorbed shortwave ﬂux is actually
a summation over two diﬀerent radiative quantities (visible and near-infrared)
with two corresponding albedos. In addition to these parameters, the constants
such as snow area fraction fsnow , penetrating fraction of visible solar readiation
ic , and bulk extinction coeﬃcient κi are identiﬁed as adjustable to compute the
ﬂux of shortwave radiation. The rate of temperature change in the ice interior is
computed by the conductive heat balance equation given as a function of various
parameters. These include the densities and thermal conductivities of snow and
ice. The thermal conductivity is the function of the conductivity of fresh ice k◦ ,

proﬁle varies from S = 0 at the top surface (z = 0) to S = Smax at the bottom
surface (z = 1).
2.2

Dynamics and Ridging Parameters

Ice motion and deformation are determined by balancing ﬁve major stresses:
wind stress from the atmosphere, water stress from the interaction between ice
and ocean, Coriolis force, the stress from the tilt of the ocean surface, and the
internal ice stress. A momentum balance equation is solved to obtain the ice
velocity in each grid cell, using the elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) rheology [3] to
relate the internal ice stress and the rates of strain. The drag coeﬃcient Dw
is used to determine the stress between the ocean and the ice. The ice ridging
scheme of the CICE code includes several tuning parameters. An empirical constant G∗ is used to determine a ridging weighting function. Larger values of G∗
allow thicker ice to participate in ridging, thereby increasing the ice strength.
H ∗ determines the thickness of ridging ice. Cs is the fraction of shear dissipation energy that contributes to ridge building. Another empirical parameter, Cf ,
accounts for frictional energy dissipation.

Processing the CICE Code with TAPENADE

Given the Fortran 90 CICE code, TAPENADE successfully produced a portable
Fortran 90 CICE.AD code that allows the tangent linear derivative computation

536

J.G. Kim, E.C. Hunke, and W.H. Lipscomb

of partial derivatives of ice conditions with respect to various thermodynamic
and dynamic input parameters. Still under the development, TAPENADE supports most of the Fortran 90 standard. Lack of support for count, present,
and dynamic memory allocation requires a preprocessing step to replace some
Fortran 90 constructs with ones acceptable to TAPENADE. Also, some type
mismatch problems with the Fortran MOD intrinsic function calls were observed
in processing the CICE code. Various netCDF calls are used in the CICE code
to write a restart ﬁle and history ﬁles during simulation. Working as I/O statements, these netCDF routines are not directly related to the diﬀerentiation process. We used TAPENADE’s blackbox approach to bypass the netCDF routines
when diﬀerentiating. To do this, we had to supply diﬀerentiation information to
TAPENADE. The same approach was used to handle the MPI library routine
calls in the CICE code. The number of lines of the TAPENADE-generated CICE
code (50000 lines) is about double the size of the original CICE code (27000
lines). The computational time of the AD-generated tangent-linear CICE code
increased proportionally with the number of independent variables.

Numerical Results
Valid Derivative Computation with Pre-tuning Step

In the EVP ice dynamics of the CICE model, several tuning parameters are
used to maintain the stability of the EVP routine. The constraining constant
Δmin (named tinyarea) for the ice strain rate computation P/max(Δ, Δmin )
critically controls the convergence behavior of computed ice velocity. Figure 1
shows the ice velocity computation with diﬀerent values of tinyareas for the
EVP subcycling iterations. In the ﬁgure, the AD-generated derivatives are also
plotted for each of the choices of tunyarea. The derivatives are computed for
the ice velocity with respect to the ocean drag coeﬃcient. Signiﬁcant oscillations
were observed in ice velocity computation with the smaller value of tinyarea,
which resulted into a divergent behavior of the AD-generated derivatives. Thus,
we further tuned the CICE code with increased tinyarea to maintain the stability
of the AD-generated derivatives. Similar oscillations were reported by B¨
ucker [1]
with two-dimensional aircraft design optimization problems. They used delayed
propagation approach to control the oscillation.

AD Sensitivity Experiment

Two diﬀerent problem sets were used for the sensitivity experiments: 100 ×
116 and 900 × 601 orthogonal grid points with 5 diﬀerent ice categories and
4 ice layers in single ice category. The forcing variables of surface air temperature, speciﬁc humidity, down-welling short-wave and long-wave radiation, and
geostropic winds derived from National Centers of Environmental Prediction
(NCEP) reanalysis and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF) global analyses were used for the simulation of the year 1987 and
1996. The multi-year spin-up result of ice thickness, concentration, and velocity

ﬁelds on January 1 was used as the initial state for the experiments. Sensitivity
experiments were carried out with respect to two main dependent variables, ice
thickness and hemispheric ice volume. A linux cluster system was used to run
the numerical experiments. Table 2 shows the measured parallel performance of
the CICE.AD code. Reasonable speed-up was achieved on up to 60 processors.
Most of the computational time was spent on the ice dynamic part where the
momentum equations for ice velocity are explicitly integrated.
Table 3 shows the sensitivity results of hemispheric ice volume for the 1987
ice conditions on coarse grid data. Note that the ice volume can be directly
computed by the multiplication of ice thickness and area of each grid cell. The
derivative numbers were nondimensionalized by using the computed ice volume
and parameter values. The ﬁrst column of the table lists the 12-month sum of
sensitivity magnitudes for each of the 20 parameters, with larger values indicating greater sensitivity. The high sensitivity result of ice density is largely an
artifact of the way density is treated in the CICE code. Increasing ice density resulted in a smaller value of the speciﬁc heat of melting and a higher temperature
change. This unphysical warming reduces winter ice growth and increases summer melting. Multiple year runs are required to determine the true sensitivity
of the thickness to ice density. From the table we see that parameters aﬀecting the conductivity and radiative absorption are of paramount importance for
simulating ice volume in the sea ice model; with the exception of Dw , dynamics
and ridging parameters are less important than the thermodynamic parameters.
If we were using ice velocity as the dependent variable, however, the dynamics

Summary

In this study, a sensitivity-enhanced simulation approach for global sea-ice modeling was investigated through the AD method. We observed a pre-tuning step
was required to obtain stable convergence behaviors of the AD-based CICE code.
An important result from this study is the prominent sensitivity of ice thickness
to radiative control parameters. For example, emissivity and albedo parameters have not been scrutinized in sea ice model development. This study shows
that multivariate sensitivity analysis for those parameters can be easily accomplished based on the AD method. Also, the AD-based scheme for computing
derivatives provides an eﬃcient guideline to adjust those important parameters.

Implemented by the black-box approach of TAPENADE, the parallel MPI routines of the CICE were successfully processed. Signiﬁcant parallel performance
was obtained for a large-size problem set. In future work, we plan to further explore the CICE model’s parameter space using the best available data for both
hemispheres, including satellite-derived ice concentration and ice deformation.
Furthermore, we plan to tune the model using long-term (decadal) observational
data.
