Abstract. The formation of superoxide at Ag(100) and Ag(111) surfaces for
cluster and periodic slab models is studied by applying first-principles density
functional theory calculations, including ab-initio molecular dynamics. Adsorption
energies and structural parameters are discussed in detail. Charge transfer analyses
indicate that O2- preferentially forms on clusters, particularly at an Ag(100)
surface.
Keywords: Density Functional Theory, Ag Nanoparticles, Oxygen Adsorption.

1 Introduction
The potential for toxicity in nanomaterials has been recently summarized by Nel et
al., [1], particularly regarding reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, pointing out
that under conditions of excess ROS production, natural antioxidant defenses may be
overwhelmed, which can impair or destroy cell proteins, lipids and DNA, thus leading
to deterioration of cell function, or toxicity [2]. The effects of oxidative stress on cell
behavior in vivo and in cell culture, where glutathione (GSH) is depleted, were
recently described [3]. Indeed, concerns regarding health safety of nanoparticles have
been consistently growing in the last few years [4.5,6,7,8]. However, the mechanisms
by which nanoparticles generate ROS are still unclear. For example, it was proposed
that the early phase of ROS production is due to redox cycling chemistry, while
mitochondria are responsible for the late and progressive increase in O2- radicals [9].
Possible mechanisms range from H2O2 production, generation of superoxide anion by
redox cycling reactions, electron-acceptor active groups for superoxide anion
generation, catalyzing electron transport to oxygen, presence of metal nanoparticles
that may induce Fenton-like chemistry to generate hydroxyl radicals from H2O2, or
light activation, e.g. of TiO2 or C60 for the formation of superoxides [9].
At the same time, the antibacterial effect of silver nanoparticles resulted in their
extensive application in health and home products, therefore making an evaluation of
their toxicity an important undertaking, motivating animal experimental studies, and
also the development of means for distribution of specific concentrations of silver
nanoparticles [10]. Toxicity of Ag nanoparticles (15-50 nm in diameter) was recently

demonstrated in vitro [11], where an investigation of the role of oxidative stress has
shown increased ROS generation, noting differences due to the Ag nanoparticle size.
Of course, the interaction of oxygen with silver has been studied for a long time,
particularly as Ag is one of the best partial oxidation catalysts for industrial reactions,
including the oxidative coupling of methane, partial dehydrogenation of methanol to
formaldehyde, and epoxidation of ethylene, for example, as investigated by Avdeev
and co-workers [12, and references therein], in order to explain the enhanced
reactivity, also by understanding the role of subsurface oxygen upon dissociation, for
example, theoretically [13,14,15, and references therein]. It has also been shown that
an electron is transferred to O2, where the reduction of the dioxygen results in a
superoxide anion metastable species, as a precursor for its dissociation [16,17,18],
also depending on the silver facet. It was noted that the O-O bond at a silver cluster is
weaker than at a bulk surface [19], possibly supporting the supposition that
superoxide anions at the surface may result in toxicity for small Ag nanoparticles.
Note however that the particles that compose the Ag catalyst, for example, are
affected by many surface defects and their chemistry could be different from that of
perfect low-Miller-index surfaces, as has been suggested, and studied [20].
In this work, as the first step towards gaining an understanding of the charge
transfer characteristics and adsorption of oxygen, applying first principles density
functional theory (DFT), we investigated the effects of O2 adsorption at facets of a
truncated octahedron (TO) cluster, as observed experimentally [21], and for
comparison, also at a Ag(100) slab, as test problems, which may possibly
preliminarily explain, in part, changes in toxicity of Ag nanoparticles of different size.
Note, however, that comprehensive simulations to model the system in room
temperature will be carried out in the future to further understand this system.

2 Computational Details
Calculations were performed with all-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals
DFT method as implemented in Dmol3 [22]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional [23] and a double numerical basis set with dfunctions (DND) were applied. For validation, O2 molecular calculations were
carried out using unrestricted spin calculations, resulting in an O—O distance (rO-O)
of 1.22Å and a dissociation energy of 5.3 eV in the gas phase, in good agreement with
experimental results (1.21Å and 5.2 eV) [24] and a previous theoretical study (1.24Å
and 5.3 eV) [25].

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Parameters
Fig. 1 summarizes the optimized structures for Ag(100) and Ag(111) surface cluster
models, upon oxygen adsorption, as well as for the corresponding slab structures.
Structural parameters are listed in Table 1.

As shown in Fig. 1, the adsorption sites that were considered for Ag(100) consisted
of O2 chemisorption at the four-fold site (C(100)1), a crossed configuration (C(100)2),
and dissociated O2, where each oxygen occupies a four-fold site (C(100)3). In the Ag
(111) plane, we considered a bridged configuration (C(111)1) and three-fold
adsorption (C(111)2). For the TO cluster, a preference in the adsorption of O2 at an
Ag(100) surface was calculated, specifically for configuration C(100)1.
The results show that for model C(100)1, rO-O distances are consistent with
previous work on discerning O-O distances upon superoxide formation when
adsorbed at Ag [16,17,18,26], while a shorter distance is noted for the an Ag(111)
surface. Although the O-O bond is weakened, charge transfer is less pronounced in

this case, not yet in the distance range of a superoxide formation. Interestingly,
results for a cluster and a slab, carried out for comparison, show somewhat larger rO-O
for the cluster, consistent with the previous suggestion that the O-O bond may be
weaker at a cluster than on a bulk surface [19]. Ag—O distances are in relatively
good agreement with previously reported results [27,28] for a periodic system,
however applying a plane wave basis set. The lengthened Ag—Ag distances
calculated in the four-fold hollow site for the cluster (3.17 Å), as compared to the
extended system (3.07Å), may explain the slight increase of rO-O in C(100)3.
3.2 Adsorption Energies
Charged molecular species binding to the silver metal have been proposed as
intermediates, namely, the superoxide and peroxide species, suggesting the
possibility of long-lived trapped states due to deep potential wells [18]. Indeed, in
carrying out ab initio MD simulations (Fig. 2), with runs of about 1 ps, in order to
assess preferred configurations, with C(111)2 as the starting configuration, C(111)1
was found to be the stable structure at about 400°K, with an oxygen atom moving
toward the center of the fourfold site, possibly denoting a trapped metastable state
and no dissociation.
The characteristics of dissociative oxygen adsorption on silver surfaces has drawn
significant interest, because it is an important step in the catalytic oxidation reaction
[17,29]. Although a dissociated molecule at temperatures lower than 110°K on
clusters was shown [19], where dissociation occurs from molecular chemisorbed O2-,
the experiments were carried out for very small clusters, up to 25 Ag atoms, noting
that a larger energy barrier would be exhibited for a bulk surface. An investigation
[30] of the interaction of molecular oxygen with bulk Ag(100) has shown that
although some oxygen molecules adsorb dissociatively at low temperatures, a higher

pressure and temperature of about 470°K are required to achieve larger surfaces with
oxygen atom adsorption. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that superoxide
species are more likely to form on Ag clusters, specifically at the Ag(100) facet.
However, conclusive results have yet to be obtained, particularly regarding
calculations of barrier heights, and consideration of realistic samples.
3.3 Charge Transfer
As expected, our calculations showed charge transfer from Ag surfaces to the
adsorbed O2 molecule, where for configuration C(100)1 a larger partial atomic charge
(-0.74/O2) than for C(100)2 (-0.64/O2) was calculated (Table 1). A larger charge
transfer is consistent with the increase in the rO-O distance, more pronounced for the
cluster than for the slab model. A smaller charge transfer for Ag(111) adsorption, as
compared to the Ag(100) surface, was calculated.

4 Summary
In this communication, we presented a DFT first principles study, including MD
simulations, to investigate the possibility of superoxide formation on Ag(100) and

358

Ag(111) surfaces. We found the four-fold adsorption site to be more favorable in
Ag(100) as compared to C(100)2, and also to adsorption at Ag(111). Because of the
lack of comprehensive experimental data on silver nanoparticles, oxygen dissociation
mechanisms are yet to be definitively elucidated in comparison with the bulk. The
charge transfer results indicate a higher preference for superoxide formation on an
Ag(100) cluster surface, providing the first stage towards attempting to understand
ROS formation in silver nanoparticles.
