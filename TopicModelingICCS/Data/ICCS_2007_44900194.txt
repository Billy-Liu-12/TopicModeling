Abstract. In complex system problems, a Decision Maker (DM) is often faced with choosing a subset of alternatives from a bigger set. This
process is known as multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). Examples of MCDM include decision making in human resource management,
water resource management, environmental management and site selection, energy policy issues, portfolio selection, transportation and routing
selection, student admission. In general, there are several criteria that
need to be satisﬁed; however, they are usually at least partly conﬂicting.
In this study, we propose a pseudo-boolean approach for multiple criteria
decision making on complex system problems. The computational results
illustrate both robustness and attractiveness of this solution approach.
Keywords: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization, Multiple Criteria Decision
Making.

Introduction

Complex system problems are often hard to model and some of them can be represented by nonlinear objective functions with interconnectedness among multiple dimensional spaces. Conventional mathematical programming approaches
are sometimes unable to solve it directly. It is conventional wisdom to apply the
combination of artiﬁcial intelligent, evolutionary computation, system dynamics
and heuristic such as genetic algorithm and ant colony to solve these problems
[1,2,3,4,5,6]. Other approaches using chaos theory and morphological analysis
are reported in the literature [7,8]. In this study, we apply multiple criteria decision making model to complex systems which can be solved by a pseudo-boolean
optimization approach.
pseudo-boolean formulations are widely known for their ability to represent a
rich variety of important discrete problems, which are often NP-hard. Hammer
and Rudeanu [9] introduced pseudo-boolean optimization in their early work
and presented a dynamic programming procedure for solving certain problems.

In their paper, they gave a deﬁnition of a ﬁrst-order derivative and indicated its
use in solving discrete pseudo-boolean optimization problems. Detail surveys of
pseudo-boolean optimization are given by Boris and Hammer [10] and Crama
and Hammer [11].
In this paper we extend this notion of ﬁrst order derivatives by deﬁning higherorder derivatives for discrete pseudo-boolean optimization. Moreover, in the context of changing r elements of x at a time (the so-called r-ﬂip moves for r=
2 and 3), we present closed-form formulas that allow ’eﬃcient ’ implementation
of such compound moves. Then, for the important special cases of quadratic
and cubic optimization, we deﬁne a general r-ﬂip move that allows eﬃcient implementation of multi-exchange neighborhood search process for solving such
problems. Finally, we illustrate the use of such moves by applying variants of
simple search processes based on r-ﬂip moves (with r = 1 and 2) to a test bed of
complex system problems. The paper then concludes with summary and a look
ahead to future research.

Multiple Criteria Decision Making

In complex system problems, a Decision Maker (DM) is often faced with choosing
a subset of alternatives from a bigger set. This process is known as multiple
criteria decision making (MCDM). Examples include decision making in human
resource management, water resource management, environmental management
and site selection, energy policy issues, portfolio selection, transportation and
routing selection, student admission. In complex system, there are several criteria
that need to be satisﬁed; however, they are usually at least partly conﬂicting. If
an alternative is selected in conjunction with other alternatives it has diﬀerent
(positive or negative) eﬀects on a speciﬁc criterion. Thus, selected alternatives
have interaction eﬀects on diﬀerent criteria. Often a DM in practices uses a
simple weighted linear function to rank alternatives then select top few. Not
considering interdependencies among alternatives can lead to an undesirable
outcome. For an illustration consider the following example on Waste Disposal
Location (WDL) problem taken from Rajabi et al. [12]. In WDL problem, the
objective is to identify the two best among ﬁve potential sites of equal capacity.
Three criteria for success has been identiﬁed, (1) proximity to population, (2)
infrastructure requirements, and (3) environmental risk. The WDL problem is
characterized by certain interdependencies among alternatives. Building a new
road near sites 4 and 5 could serve both sites; if both sites are selected, a saving
in infrastructure investment will be obtained. If both sites, 4 and 5, are selected
there is an increased of 10% on the infrastructure investment criterion. Similarly,
if sites 1 and 2 are simultaneously selected then a single power plant facility may
be built for both, taking advantage of economy of scale. In that case, a positive
energy of 30% is estimated when it comes to infrastructure investment criterion.
Finally, when it comes to environmental risk criterion, selection of site 4 and 5
together has a negative eﬀect of 30% . The scenario is illustrated in the Figure 1,
and data is presented in Table 1.

The following notations are adopted in the paper:
N = {a1 , . . . , an } is set of alternatives.
ai , (i = 1, . . . , n) is alternative i.
P = {1, . . . , n} is set of criteria.
cik is eﬀect of alternative i on criterion k.
Sk is a set of alternatives that if selected together have some positive or negative
eﬀect on criterion k.
γ(Sk ) is the amount of eﬀect (positive or negative) of an interacting set Sk on
criterion k.
wk is weight associated with criterion k.
v(S) is total payoﬀ of a subset of alternatives S ⊆ N .
xi is equal to 1 if an alternative ai is selected and 0 otherwise.
To illustrate the notations, consider Table 1, we have 5 alternatives N =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and 3 criteria P = {1, 2, 3}. Alternative A2 has eﬀects of c21 =
0.45, c22 = 0.70, and c23 = 0.87 on criterion, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Weights of
criteria are w = (w1 , w2 , w3 ) = (0.23, 0.39, 0.38). Considering criterion 2 there
are two interacting alternatives, S2 = {a1 , a2 } and S2 = {a4 , a5 }, with interaction eﬀects (positive energy) of γ({a1 , a2 }) = 0.30 and γ({a4 , a5 }) = 0.10. If no

interdependencies are considered among the alternatives then the payoﬀ value
is deﬁned as a simple additive function, for example, for S = {ai , aj } we have
v(ai , aj ) = v(ai ) + v(aj ) =

k=1

wk cik +

k=1

wk cjk .

In this case, considering all possible set of 2 alternatives and selecting a subset
with the largest payoﬀ we have optimal solution as v(a4 , a5 ) = v(a4 ) + v(a5 ) =
0.735 + 0.745 = 1.48. However, this is a simplistic view of the situation. If
we consider interdependencies between alternatives and taking into accounts
positive and negative energies we have a dynamic weight for each criterion when
applied to an alternative. The dynamic weight of an alternative depends on its
interaction with other alternatives in the selected subset.

Model and Solution Methodology

In the following, we will present a pseudo-boolean formulation of the problem
that can overcome both of these deﬁciencies if appropriate solution procedure is
available. The pseudo-boolean optimization for the problem can be presented as
a maximization problem given below [10].

xi ∈ {0, 1}.
In this problem, if we want to ﬁnd any subset of alternatives with largest payoﬀ,
then we remove the equality constraint and solve the problem.
To illustrate the optimization problem we use the WDL example presented
below.
Max .644x1 + .707x2 + .713x3 + .735x4 + .745x5 + .39(.30)[.80 + .70]x1 x2 +
.39(.10)[.83 + .83]x4 x5 − .39(.30)[.75 + .60]x4 x5
s.t.
x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 2,
xi ∈ {0, 1}.
Simplifying the above formulation we get
Max .644x1 + .707x2 + .713x3 + .735x4 + .745x5 + .1755x1 x2 − .8916x4 x5
s.t.

x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 2,
xi ∈ {0, 1}.

Glover [13] used an eﬃcient 1-ﬂip search implementation and tested it in the
context of Tabu Search and Scatter Search.
Deﬁnition 1. Let x = (x1 , . . . , xi , . . . , xn ) be a solution to pseudo-boolean and
let x = (x1 , . . . , x
¯i , . . . , xn ) be a solution obtained from x by complementing xi .

Since Q is upper triangular matrix then (ij)th element,qij ,is equal to the second
derivative of f (x), i.e.,δij (x) = qij , with respect to xi and xj .
Theorem 1 (Glover et al.[14]). For x and x as given in Deﬁnition 1, the
change in the value of the objective function is
f (x ) − f (x) = (xi − xi )Δi (x)
Moreover, in any local optimal solution of the pseudo-boolean with respect to
1-ﬂip search we have
either (xi = 0 ⇐⇒ Δi (x) 0) or (xi = 1 ⇐⇒ Δi (x) 0), ∀i = 1, . . . , n.
Furthermore, after changing xi to x
¯i the update for all Δi (x) can be calculated
as follows
∀j < i,
∀j > i,

Δj (x) = Δj (x) + qji (xi − xi ),
Δj (x) = Δj (x) + qij (xi − xi ),

j = i,

Δj (x) = Δi (x).

In Theorem 2, we extend the above result to general case for r-ﬂip search for
pseudo-boolean.
Theorem 2. Let x be a given solution of pseudo-boolean and x obtained from
x by an r-ﬂip move where S ⊆ V , and |S| = r . Now, the change in the value of
the objective function is
xi − xx )Δi (x) + ∀i,j∈S (¯
xi − xi )(¯
xj − xj )Δij (x).
f (x ) − f (x) = i∈S (¯
Furthermore, after changing x to x the update for all Δi (x) can be calculated
as follows,
∀j ∈ V \ S

(¯
xi − xi )Δij (x), and

Δj (x) = Δj (x) +

∀j ∈ S

Δj (x) = Δj (x) +
i∈S\{j}

Proof. For two vectors x and x where component xi for all i ∈ S are complemented we have f (x) and f (x ) as follows:
f (x) = i∈S xi [qij + j ∈S

ij∈S xi xj qij + . . .

For each pair of elements i, j in the second and the third terms we have

From this we get

xi − xi )(¯

f (x ) − f (x) = i∈S (¯
which proves the ﬁrst part of the theorem.
Note that we can substitute Δij (x) for qij . From this the desired result follows immediately. We propose several methods to solve the transformed pseudoboolean problem.
Filtration and Sequential Fan(F&F) (see Glover[13]) is a search process utilizing compound move strategies that have proven to be eﬀective for a variety
of combinatorial problems. Here we employ a simple version of F&F utilizing a
combination of r-ﬂip moves. In the paragraph below we give a brief overview of
our implementation.
F&F organizes an aggressive search process utilizing a variety of diﬀerent r-ﬂip
moves. The version we tested here starts with a set of locally optimal solutions
found using 1-ﬂip search. Then, for each solution in this set a second round of
1-ﬂip moves is executed. If an improving move is found we accept that move and
initiate a complete new round of 1-ﬂip moves. If an improving second ﬂip move
can not be found, we initiate a series of 3-ﬂip moves starting with the best local
optimal solutions found so far. This continues until a pre-set stopping criterion
is satisﬁed or until no further improvement is realized.

Computational Results

Table 2 presents all subset of 2 alternatives and associated weights of each criterion, and payoﬀ value of the selected subset of alternatives. In that, obviously
subset (a4 , a5 ) is not any more the optimal solution as we have v(a4 , a5 ) =
1.391. However, the subset (a1 , a2 ) has the largest payoﬀ of v(a1 , a2 ) = 1.526
which is optimal. Table 3 illustrates calculation of weights for each criterion
for all subsets of 4 alternatives solved via Method 4. The dynamic nature of
weights is clear from these tables. Obviously, when the interdependencies among

alternatives on diﬀerent criteria are high the level of dynamism for each weight is
also high. While considering the interdependencies among alternatives represents
the practical nature of the problem, however calculating the dynamic weights
is very diﬃcult. If we need to select m alternatives with highest total payoﬀ
we have to consider calculation of weights in all possible m set of alternatives.
And, in case, the problem is to select the best subset of alternatives (with no
pre-speciﬁed number of elements) we have to calculate weights for all subset of
alternatives. In both cases, the number of subsets is exponential.

Summary and Conclusion

In this paper we reported on modeling complex system problems with the
pseudo-boolean formulation and proposed several solution approaches. The complex systems with very high-dimensional spaces often associate with more complicated variables. The pseudo-boolean formulation can reduce the variable
dimension without loss important information. The preliminary results illustrate the attractiveness of this modeling method in term of generating the best
alternative. In our continuing work, we intend to carry out further testing of
pseudo-boolean formulation on cubic, quartic, even quintic variables.
