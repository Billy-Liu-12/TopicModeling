Abstract. Assimilation of spatially- and temporally-distributed state
observations into simulations of dynamical systems stemming from discretized PDEs leads to inverse problems with high-dimensional control
spaces in the form of discretized initial conditions. Solution of such inverse problems in “real-time” is often intractable. This motivates the
construction of reduced-order models that can be used as surrogates of
the high-ﬁdelity simulations during inverse solution. For the surrogates
to be useful, they must be able to approximate the observable quantities
over a wide range of initial conditions. Construction of the reduced models entails sampling the initial condition space to generate an appropriate
training set, which is an intractable proposition for high dimensional initial condition spaces unless the problem structure can be exploited. Here,
we present a method that extracts the dominant spectrum of the inputoutput map (i.e. the Hessian of the least squares optimization problem)
at low cost, and uses the principal eigenvectors as sample points. We
demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the reduction methodology on a large-scale
contaminant transport problem.

Introduction

One important component of Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems
(DDDAS) is the continuous assimilation of sensor data into an ongoing simulation. This inverse problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem,

in which the controls are the initial conditions, the constraints are the state
equations describing the dynamics of the system, and the objective is the diﬀerence between the state observations and those predicted by the state equations,
measured in some appropriate norm.
When the physical system being simulated is governed by partial diﬀerential
equations in three spatial dimensions and time, the forward problem alone (i.e.
solution of the PDEs for a given initial condition) may requires many hours
of supercomputer time. The inverse problem, which requires repeated solution
of the forward problem, may then be out of reach in situations where rapid
assimilation of the data is required. In particular, when the simulation is used
as a basis for forecasting or decision-making, a reduced model that can execute
much more rapidly than the high-ﬁdelity PDE simulation is then needed. A
crucial requirement for the reduced model is that it be able to replicate the
output quantities of interest (i.e. the observables) of the PDE simulation over a
wide range of initial conditions, so that it may serve as a surrogate of the high
ﬁdelity PDE simulation during inversion.
One popular method for generating a reduced model is through a projection
basis (for example, by proper orthogonal decomposition in conjunction with
the method of snapshots). To build such a reduced order model, one typically
constructs a training set by sampling the space of (discretized) initial conditions.
When this space is high-dimensional, the problem of adequately sampling it
quickly becomes intractable. Fortunately, for many ill-posed inverse problems,
many components of the initial condition space have minimal or no eﬀect on the
output observables. This is particularly true when the observations are sparse.
In this case, it is likely that an eﬀective reduced model can be generated with
few sample points. The question is how to locate these sample points.
Here, we consider the case of a linear forward problem, and propose that the
sample points be associated with dominant eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix
of the misﬁt function. This matrix maps inputs (initial conditions) to outputs
(observables), and its dominant eigenvectors represent initial condition components that are most identiﬁable from observable data. Thus, one expects these
eigenvectors to serve as good sample points for constructing the reduced model.
In Section 2, we describe the model reduction framework we consider, and
in Section 3 justify the choice of the dominant eigenvectors of the Hessian by
relating it to solution of a certain greedy optimization problem to locate the best
sample points. Section 4 illustrates the methodology via application to a data
assimilation inverse problem involving transport of an atmospheric contaminant.

Reduced-Order Dynamical Systems

Consider the general linear initial-value problem
x(k + 1) = Ax(k),
y(k) = Cx(k),
x(0) = x0 ,

k = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1,

(1)

k = 0, 1, . . . , T,

(2)
(3)

1012

O. Bashir et al.

where x(k) ∈ IRN is the system state at time tk , the vector x0 contains the
speciﬁed initial state, and we consider a time horizon from t = 0 to t = tT . The
vector y(k) ∈ IRQ contains the Q system outputs at time tk . In general, we are
interested in systems of the form (1)–(3) that result from spatial and temporal
discretization of PDEs. In this case, the dimension of the system, N , is very large
and the matrices A ∈ IRN ×N and C ∈ IRQ×N result from the chosen spatial and
temporal discretization methods.
A reduced-order model of (1)–(3) can be derived by assuming that the state
x(k) is represented as a linear combination of n basis vectors,
xˆ(k) = V xr (k),

(4)

where x
ˆ(k) is the reduced model approximation of the state x(k) and n
N . The
projection matrix V ∈ IRN ×n contains as columns the orthonormal basis vectors
Vi , i.e., V = [V1 V2 · · · Vn ], and the reduced-order state xr (k) ∈ IRn contains
the corresponding modal amplitudes for time tk . Using the representation (4)
together with a Galerkin projection of the discrete-time system (1)–(3) onto the
space spanned by the basis V yields the reduced-order model with state xr and
output yr ,
xr (k + 1) = Ar xr (k),
yr (k) = Cr xr (k),

k = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1,
k = 0, 1, . . . , T,

(5)
(6)

xr (0) = V T x0 ,

(7)

where Ar = V T AV and Cr = CV .
For convenience of notation, we write the discrete-time system (1)–(3) in
matrix form as
Ax = Fx0 ,

y = Cx,

T

(8)
T

where x = x(0)T x(1)T . . . x(T )T , y = y(0)T y(1)T . . . y(T )T , and the
matrices A, F, and C are appropriately deﬁned functions of A and C. Similarly,
the reduced-order model (5)–(7) can be written in matrix form as
Ar xr = Fr x0 ,

yr = Cr xr ,

(9)

where xr , yr , Ar , and Cr are deﬁned analogously to x, y, A, and C but with
T
the appropriate reduced-order quantities, and Fr = [V 0 . . . 0] .
In many cases, we are interested in rapid identiﬁcation of initial conditions
from sparse measurements of the states over a time horizon; we thus require a
reduced-order model that will provide accurate outputs for any initial condition
contained in some set X0 . Using the projection framework described above, the
task therefore becomes one of choosing an appropriate basis V so that the error
between full-order output y and the reduced-order output yr is small for all
initial conditions of interest.

Hessian-Based Model Reduction

To determine the reduced model, we must identify a set of initial conditions to
be sampled. At each selected initial condition, a forward simulation is performed
to generate a set of states, commonly referred to as snapshots, from which the
reduced basis is formed. The key question is then how to identify important
initial conditions that should be sampled. Our approach is motivated by the
greedy algorithm of [5], which proposed an adaptive approach to determine the
parameter locations at which samples are drawn to form a reduced basis. The
greedy algorithm adaptively selects these snapshots by ﬁnding the location in
parameter–time space where the error between the full-order and reduced-order
models is maximal, updating the basis with information gathered from this sample location, forming a new reduced model, and repeating the process.
In the case of the initial-condition problem, the greedy approach amounts to
sampling at the initial condition x∗0 ∈ X0 that maximizes the error between the
full and reduced-order outputs. For this formulation, the only restriction that
we place on the set X0 is that it contain vectors of unit length. This prevents
unboundedness in the optimization problem, since otherwise the error in the
reduced system could be made arbitrarily large.
The key step in the greedy sampling approach is thus ﬁnding the worst-case
initial condition x∗0 , which can be achieved by solving the optimization problem,
x∗0 = arg max (y − yr )T (y − yr )
x0 ∈X0

where

(10)

Ax = Fx0 ,
y = Cx,

(11)
(12)

Ar xr = Fr x0 ,
yr = Cr xr .

(13)
(14)

Equations (10)-(14) deﬁne a large-scale optimization problem, which includes
the full-scale dynamics as constraints. The linearity of the state equations can
be exploited to eliminate the full-order and reduced-order states and yield an
equivalent unconstrained optimization problem,
x∗0 = arg max xT0 H e x0 ,
x0 ∈X0

where

H e = CA−1 F − Cr A−1
r Fr

T

CA−1 F − Cr A−1
r Fr .

(15)

(16)

It can be seen that (15) is a quadratic unconstrained optimization problem with
Hessian matrix H e ∈ IRN ×N . From (16), it can be seen that H e is a symmetric
positive semideﬁnite matrix. Since we are considering initial conditions of unit
norm, the solution x∗0 maximizes the Rayleigh quotient; therefore, the solution
of (15) is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of H e .

1014

O. Bashir et al.

This eigenvector is the initial condition for which the error in reduced model
output prediction is largest.
Rather than constructing a reduced model at every greedy iteration, and determining the dominant eigenvector of the resulting error Hessian He , an eﬃcient
one-shot algorithm can be constructed by computing the dominant eigenmodes
of the Hessian matrix
H = CA−1 F

T

CA−1 F .

(17)

Here, H ∈ IRN ×N is the Hessian matrix of the full-scale system, and does not
depend on the reduced-order model. As before, H is a symmetric positive semideﬁnite matrix. It can be shown that, under certain assumptions, the eigenvectors of H with largest eigenvalues approximately solve the sequence of problems
deﬁned by (10)–(14) [3].
These ideas motivate the following basis-construction algorithm for the initial condition problem. We use the dominant eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix
H to identify the initial-condition vectors that have the most signiﬁcant contributions to the outputs of interest. These vectors are in turn used to initialize the full-scale discrete-time system to generate a set of state snapshots that
are used to form the reduced basis (using, for example, the proper orthogonal
decomposition).

Application: Model Reduction for 3D Contaminant
Transport in an Urban Canyon

We demonstrate our model reduction method by applying it to a 3D airborne
contaminant transport problem for which a solution is needed in real time.
Intentional or unintentional chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) contamination events are important national security concerns. In particular, if
contamination occurs in or near a populated area, predictive tools are needed
to rapidly and accurately forecast the contaminant spread to provide decision
support for emergency response eﬀorts. Urban areas are geometrically complex
and require detailed spatial discretization to resolve the relevant ﬂow and transport, making prediction in real-time diﬃcult. Reduced-order models can play an
important role in facilitating real-time turn-around, in particular on laptops in
the ﬁeld. However, it is essential that these reduced models be faithful over a
wide range of initial conditions, since in principle any initial condition can be
realized. Once a suitable reduced-order model has been generated, it can serve
as a surrogate for the full model within an inversion framework to identify the
initial conditions given sensor data (the full-scale case is discussed in [1]).
To illustrate the generation of a reduced-order model that is accurate for
arbitrary high-dimensional initial conditions, we consider a three-dimensional
urban canyon geometry occupying a (dimensionless) 15 × 15 × 15 domain. Figure 1 shows the domain and buildings, along with locations of six sensors, all

(21)

where w is the contaminant concentration, v is the velocity vector ﬁeld, κ is the
diﬀusivity, tf is the time horizon of interest, and w0 is the given initial condition.
ΓD and ΓN are respectively the portions of the domain boundary over which
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are applied. Eq. (18) is discretized
in space using an SUPG ﬁnite element method with linear tetrahedra, while
the implicit Crank-Nicolson method is used to discretize in time. Homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions are speciﬁed for the concentration on the inﬂow
boundary, x¯ = 0, and the ground, z¯ = 0. Homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions are speciﬁed for the concentration on all other boundaries.
The velocity ﬁeld, v, required in (18) is computed by solving the steady
laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, also discretized with SUPGstabilized linear tetrahedra. No-slip conditions, i.e. v = 0, are imposed on the
building faces and the ground z¯ = 0. The velocity at the inﬂow boundary x
¯=0
is taken as known and speciﬁed in the normal direction as
vx (z) = vmax

with vmax = 3.0 and zmax = 15, and zero tangentially. On the outﬂow boundary
x
¯ = 15, a traction-free (Neumann) condition is applied. On all other boundaries
(¯
y = 0, y¯ = 15, z¯ = 15), we impose a combination of no ﬂow normal to the
boundary and traction-free tangent to the boundary. The spatial mesh for the
full-scale system contains 68,921 nodes and 64,000 tetrahedral elements. For
both basis creation and testing, a ﬁnal non-dimensional time tf = 20.0 is used,
and discretized over 200 timesteps. The Peclet number based on the maximum
inﬂow velocity and domain dimension is Pe=900. The PETSc library [2] is used
for all implementation.
Figure 2 illustrates a sample forward solution. The test initial condition used
in this simulation, meant to represent the system state just after a contaminant
release event, was constructed using a Gaussian function with a peak magnitude of 100 centered at a height of 1.5. For comparison with the full system,
a reduced model was constructed based on the dominant Hessian eigenvector
algorithm discussed in the previous section, with p = 31 eigenvector initial conditions and n = 137 reduced basis vectors (these numbers were determined based
on eigenvalue decay rates). Eigenvectors were computed using the Arnoldi eigensolver within the SLEPc package [4], which is built on PETSc. Figure 3 shows a
comparison of the full and reduced time history of concentration at each output
