Abstract. The loss of population diversity is one of the main problems in some
applications of evolutionary algorithms. In order to maintain useful population
diversity some special techniques must be used, like niching or co-evolutionary
mechanisms. In this paper the mechanisms for maintaining population diversity
in agent-based multi-objective (co-)evolutionary algorithms are proposed. The
presentation of techniques is accompanied by the results of experiments and comparisons to “classical” evolutionary multi-objective algorithms.
Keywords: Agent-based evolutionary computation, maintaining population diversity, sexual selection, flock-based operators.

1 Introduction
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are techniques inspired by Darwinian model of evolutionary processes observed in nature. They have demonstrated in practice eﬃciency
and robustness as global optimization techniques. However, sometimes the loss of useful population diversity limits the possibilities of their application in some areas (like,
for example, multi-modal optimization, multi-criteria optimization, dynamic problems,
etc.)
In the case of multi-objective optimization problems loss of population diversity may
cause that the population locates in the areas far from Pareto frontier or that individuals are located only in selected areas of Pareto frontier. In the case of multi-objective
problems with many local Pareto frontiers (defined by Deb in [5]) the loss of population diversity may result in locating only local Pareto frontier instead of a global one.
In order to avoid such negative tendencies special mechanisms are used, like niching
techniques, co-evolutionary algorithms and sexual selection.
Evolutionary multi-agent systems (EMAS) are multi-agent systems, in which there
are three basic mechanisms needed in order to start and maintain evolutionary processes:
limited resources that agents need for all activities and for which they compete, and
agents’ abilities to reproduce and die. Basic EMAS model also suﬀers from the negative
tendency to loss the population diversity, however, as we will show in the following
sections, it can be equipped with additional mechanisms and operators which improve
the quality of obtained results. The general model of co-evolutionary multi-agent system

(CoEMAS) [6] introduces additionally the notions of species, sexes, and interactions
between them. CoEMAS allows modeling and simulation of diﬀerent co-evolutionary
interactions, which can serve as the basis for constructing the techniques of maintaining
population diversity and improving adaptive capabilities of such systems (for example
see [7]).
In the following sections mechanisms for maintaining useful population diversity
in “classical” evolutionary multi-objective algorithms are presented. Next, new techniques for (co-)evolutionary multi agent systems for multi-objective optimization are
proposed. The presentation of proposed techniques is accompanied with the examples
of selected experimental results and comparisons to “classical” multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

2 Previous Research on Maintaining Population Diversity in
Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithms
In order to maintain useful population diversity and introduce speciation (process of
forming species—subpopulations—located in diﬀerent areas of solutions’ space) special techniques are used like niching mechanisms and co-evolutionary models. Niching techniques are primarily applied in multi-modal optimization problems, but they
are also used in evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. During the years of research
various niching techniques have been proposed [16], which allow niche formation via
the modification of mechanism of selecting individuals for new generation (crowding
model), the modification of the parent selection mechanism (fitness sharing technique
or sexual selection mechanism), or restricted application of selection and/or recombination mechanisms (by grouping individuals into subpopulations or by introducing the
environment with some topography in which the individuals are located).
Fitness sharing technique in objective space was used in Hajela and Lin genetic
algorithm for multi-objective optimization based on weighting method [10], by Fonseca and Fleming in their multi-objective genetic algorithm using Pareto-based ranking
procedure [8], and in the niched Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) (during the tournament selection in order to decide which individual wins the tournament) [11]. In nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) the fitness sharing is performed in decision space, within each set of non-dominated individuals separately, in order to maintain
high population diversity [17]. In strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) [19]
special type of fitness sharing (based on Pareto domination relation) is used in order to
maintain diversity.
In co-evolutionary algorithms the fitness of each individual depends not only on the
quality of solution to the given problem but also (or solely) on other individuals’ fitness.
This makes such techniques applicable in the cases where the fitness function formulation is diﬃcult (or even impossible). Co-evolutionary algorithms are also applicable
in the cases when we want to maintain population diversity. Generally, each of the coevolutionary technique belongs to one of two classes: competitive or co-operative.
Laumanns, Rudolph and Schwefel proposed co-evolutionary algorithm with spatial
graph-like structure and predator-prey model for multi-objective optimization [13]. Deb
introduced modified algorithm in which predators eliminated preys not only on the basis

906

R. Dre˙zewski and L. Siwik

of one criteria but on the basis of the weighted sum of all criteria [5]. Li proposed other
modifications to this algorithm [14]. The main diﬀerence was that not only predators
were allowed to migrate within the graph but also preys could do it. The model of
co-operative co-evolution was also applied to multi-objective optimization ([12]).
Sexual selection results from co-evolution of female mate choice and male displayed
trait where females evolve to reduce direct costs associated with mating and keep them
on optimal level and males evolve to attract females to mating (sexual conflict) [9].
Sexual selection is considered to be one of the ecological mechanisms responsible for
biodiversity and sympatric speciation [9].
All the works on sexual selection mechanism for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were focused on using this mechanism for maintaining population diversity.
Allenson proposed genetic algorithm with sexual selection for multi-objective optimization in which the number of sexes was the same as the number of criteria of the given
problem [1]. Lis and Eiben proposed multi-sexual genetic algorithm (MSGA) for multiobjective optimization [15] in which also one sex for each criterion was used. They
used special multi-parent crossover operator and child had the same sex as the parent
that provided most of genes. Bonissone and Subbu continued work on Lis and Eiben’s
algorithm. They proposed additional mechanisms for determining the sex of oﬀspring
(random and phenotype-based) [3].
Co-evolution of species and sexes is the biological mechanism responsible for biodiversity and sympatric speciation. However the application of such mechanisms in
evolutionary multi-objective algorithms is still the subject of ongoing research and an
open issue.

3 Introducing Flock-Based Operators into Evolutionary
Multi-agent System
Assuming the classical structure of evolutionary multi-agent system, one of the way for
maintaining population diversity and, in the context of multi-objective optimization, for
improving the quality of the Pareto frontier approximation consists in introducing to the
system so-called flock operators i.e. (in the simplest case) creating new flock/dividing
flock into two (n) flocks and merging two (n) flocks into one flock. Taking into account multi-objective optimization goals—such operators can be realized as follows.
During meetings with agents located in the same flock agent gathers (partial) knowledge about its distance (in the decision variable space or in the objective space) from
another agents. Then, if such (partial) average distance to another agents is greater than
configured parameter(s) (to be precise, in realized system this parameter is changing
adaptively)—agent can make a decision about creating new flock (i.e. dividing particular flock into two flocks). After making such a decision agent creates a new flock,
migrates to this new flock from the “old” one and then initializes its new flock. “Initialization” process consists in cloning itself and mutating (with small range e.g. by
mutating the least significant genes) cloned descendants. The small range of mutation
ensures—or increases the probability of—sampling the agent’s neighborhood—what

Techniques for Maintaining Population Diversity

907

is very desirable since agent creating new flock stands out in its “original” flock as
“strange” agent—i.e. agent representing poorly sampled (at least by this very flock)
area of search space. Decision about the number of new cloned descendants created by
agent is an autonomous agent’s decision of course but it should ensure that flock does
not become extinct too early and on the other hand that there do not exist in the system
too many similar agents1 . In the simplest case eliminating/merging flocks operator can
be realized as follows: two flocks are being merged if their centers of gravity are located
closer than configured value and the diﬀerence between their radiuses is smaller than
given parameter2 (both of these parameters can change adaptively).

To present the influence of proposed mechanism(s)—during experiments presented
in fig. 1 and in fig. 2 operator of creating new flocks was performed in 100th and 400th
step. Presented in mentioned figures measures should be interpreted as follows: objective dispersion represents the average—measured in the objective space—distance
among individuals, decision dispersion represents the average—measured in the space
of decision variable—distance among individuals. As one may notice, introducing flock
operators influences very positively on maintaining population diversity (see fig. 1a, b,
d, e and fig. 2a, b, d, e) and in the consequence on the quality of obtained Pareto frontier
approximation (see fig. 1c, f and fig. 2c, f). Because of the space limitation there are presented in fig. 1 and in fig. 2 only characteristics related to the number of non-dominated
solutions found by flock-based and “classical” EMAS for confirming (to some extent)
that—at least during solving Zitzler problems ([19])—flock based approach allows for
obtaining much more numerous Pareto set in the comparison to the classical EMAS
approach.

4 Sexual Selection as a Technique for Maintaining Population
Diversity in CoEMAS for Multi-objective Optimization
In order to maintain population diversity in systems based on model of co-evolution in
multi-agent system (CoEMAS), mechanisms based on co-evolutionary interactions of
species and sexes may be used. Such mechanisms include, for example, host-parasite,
predator-prey, or co-operative co-evolution of species. Another way to maintain useful
diversity is to apply sexual selection mechanism—resulting system is the CoEMAS
with sexual selection (SCoEMAS, see fig. 3).
The mechanisms used in this system include: co-evolution of sexes, and sexual selection based on Pareto domination. All agents live within the environment, which has the
graph-like structure. The number of sexes corresponds with the number of criteria (each
sex has the criteria assigned to it and agents that belong to that sex are evaluated with
the assigned criteria). There is one resource defined in the system. The resource can
be possessed by the agents and the environment (there is closed circulation of resource

in the system). This resource is distributed (proportionally to the fitness values of the
agents) by each node of the graph among the agents that are located in that node.

according to the M1 , M2 and M3 metrics (table a includes selected configuration parameters for
results presented in table c, and table b includes parameters for results presented in table d)

Each time step, the agents can migrate within the environment (they lose some resource during the migration). The agent can migrate only to the node connected with
the one within which it is located. The agent chooses the node to which it will migrate on the basis of the amount of resource of that node. When the agent is ready for
reproduction (i.e. the amount of its resource is above the given level) it sends the information to the agents of other sexes located within the same node. The other agents
can response to this information when they are also ready for reproduction. Next, the
agent which initiated the reproduction process chooses one (or more—it depends on
the number of sexes in the system) of the agents of opposite sex on the basis of the
amounts of their resources (the probability of choosing the agent is proportional to the
amount of its resource). The oﬀspring is created with the use of intermediate recombination and Gaussian mutation [2]. Next, the child is compared to the individuals from
the non-dominated individuals set of the node in which parents and child are located. If
none of the individuals from this set is dominating the child then the child is copied to
the set (all individuals dominated by the child are removed from the set).
First experiments, which results are presented in this section, were aimed at investigating if SCoEMAS can be applied to multi-objective optimization problems and
whether it works properly (agents do not die oﬀ). Proposed co-evolutionary multi-agent
system with sexual selection mechanism for multi-objective optimization has been tested
using, inter alia, Tamaki and Obayashi test functions [18]. Additionally, results obtained
with the use of SCoEMAS was compared to those obtained by “classical” evolutionary
algorithms for multi-objective optimization: niched-pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA)
[5] and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) [19].
To compare proposed approach with implemented classical algorithms three metrics M1 , M2 , and M3 ([19]) were used. These metrics are defined as follows. If A ⊆ X
denotes a non-dominated set, σ ≥ 0 denotes appropriately chosen neighborhood parameter and · denotes the given distance metric—then three functions M1 (A), M2 (A)
and M3 (A) can be introduced to asses the quality of A regarding the decision space:

number of non-dominated solutions found), and M3 (A)=
i=1 max{ ai − bi | a, b ∈ A}
(the spread of non-dominated solutions over the set A, N is the number of objectives).
Presented results (fig. 4) show that SPEA is the best of all compared algorithms. It
turned out that proposed SCoEMAS with sexual selection mechanism can be used for
multi-objective problems however more research is needed to obtain better results. The
fact that results were worse than in the case of classical evolutionary multi-objective
algorithms results from the tendency to maintain high population diversity what could
be very useful in the case of hard dynamic and multi-modal multi-objective problems
(as defined by Deb [4]).

5 Conclusions
Maintaining population diversity is one of the main problems in some applications of
EAs—especially in multi-modal optimization, multi-objective optimization and adaptation in dynamic environments. In the case of multi-objective optimization problems
the loss of population diversity may result in locating only some parts of Pareto frontier
or locating a local Pareto frontier instead of the global one in the case of multi-modal
multi-objective problems.
In this paper overview of selected techniques and algorithms for maintaining
population diversity in (co-)evolutionary multi-agent systems for multi-objective optimization were presented. Proposed mechanisms worked very well from maintaining
population diversity (and in the consequence improving the quality of the Pareto frontier approximation) point of view. It is worth to mention in this place that presented
flock-based operators as well as co-evolutionary approach with sexual selection are
only selected examples of the whole range of mechanisms that can be easily introduced
into (co-)evolutionary multi-agent system and that can significantly improve the quality
of obtained solutions. Other mechanisms and models such as: semi-elitist evolutionary
multi-agent system, distributed frontier crowding, co-evolutionary multi-agent system
with host-parasite model, co-evolutionary multi-agent system with predator-prey model
should be mentioned, but because of the space limitation they are omitted in this paper. Of course, further research is needed in order to improve proposed mechanisms. It
seems that full potential abilities of these systems could be fully observed in the case of
hard multi-modal multi-objective problems in which many local Pareto frontiers exist.
The future research will also include the application of other co-evolutionary mechanisms like, for example, co-operative co-evolution.
