Abstract. Based on the binary relation theory and Warshall’s algorithm, a model on the connected incidence relation of the industry system is set up, and a handy method of quantitative analysis is provided
for understanding the industrial structure and the relation. The model
is applied to analyze the connected incidence relation of the industrial
system in Anhui Province. The results show the model is eﬀective with
simple principle and handy operation. And it provides accurate reference
for the analysis of the connected eﬀects among diﬀerent industries as well
as the adjustment and optimism of the industrial structure.

Introduction

The binary relation indicates certain relevance between two elements in the set,
which largely exist in the economic phenomenon. There are various relation and
aﬀections of diﬀerent levels in the industrial system. By means of the inputoutput table, the analysis of the industrial relation aim to analyze the relation
happening in the process of producing, distributing and exchanging among industries (Zhi-biao Liu, 2001).
In recent years, the analysis methods have been improved a lot. For instance,
the optimal theory, as well as the Graph Model (Bing-xin Zhao, 1996.) and
Degree-Hierarchy Structure Model (Liu and Zhou, 1999) are used in the analysis of the industrial relation. This essay utilizes exploringly the binary relation
theory to establish the incidence relation of the industry system and to calculate the connected incidence relation through Warshall’s algorithm. From this,
it deﬁnes the inﬂuential industrial set under analyzing the industrial relation of
industry system and the evolving regular of industrial structure.

Principle & Method Base
Establish the Incidence Relation r among Industries in the
Industrial System

Take the whole industrial system as a set S: take the industries divided according
to a certain principle as 1, 2, 3, · · · n-the elements of S, then it comes that S =
1, 2, 3, · · · n. Establish the incidence relation r of the set S:

Model on Analysis of Industrial Relation

r = {(i, j)|i ∈ s, j ∈ s, di,j ≥ α}

(1)

In this expression, dij is determined by W.leontief’s inverse matrix D = (d)ij
and α is the incidence critical value given previously. The compound relation
between the incidence relation r and r :
r ◦ r = {(p, q)|p ∈ s, q ∈ s, ∃t ∈ s((p, t) ∈ r, (t, q) ∈ r)}

(2)

If (p, q)|p ∈ r ◦ r,that is, an industry t exists in the whole system S, the
incidence relation r then happens between p and t. Meanwhile, anther r happens
between t and q. therefore, by the compound calculation of the incidence relation
r, a larger incidence relation can be obtained in the system S.
We mark the relational matrix of r as Mr = (αij )n×n , in which
y=

1
0

(i, j) ∈ r
(i, j) ∈
/r

(3)

We marked the relational matrix of r ◦ r as Mr◦r . If there’s at least one
industry t in S, which makes a relation between p and t, namely (p, t) ∈ r.and a
relation between t and q, namely(t, q) ∈ r, then a relation between p and q must
form (p, q) ∈ r. However, there may not only one industry t that can meet the
system S, another one t can also satisfy the quest (p, t ) ∈ r ,(t , q) ∈ r. In all
these situation,(p, q) ∈ r ◦ r will be available.
In this way, when we scan row p and column q of Mr , if we ﬁnd at least one
t which makes the number of t and q is 1, then the number of the site of row
t and column q is also 1. Otherwise, it will be 0. Scan one row of Mr and each
column of Mr , we will know Mr◦r and all the other rows of Mr◦r can also be
obtained in the similar way.
Thus, we’ll get Mr◦r through Boolean’s plus method of matrix. That is,
n

Mr◦r = Mr ◦ Mr = (bpq )n×n ,in which bpq = ∨ (αpt ∧ αtq ). where, ∨ is Boolean’s
t=1

add, conforming to 0 ∨ 0 = 0, 0 ∨ 1 = 1, 1 ∨ 0 = 1, 1 ∨ 1 = 1; ∧ is Boolean’s
multiplication, conforming to 0 ∧ 0 = 0, 0 ∧ 1 = 0,1 ∧ 0 = 0,1 ∧ 1 = 1.
According to the incidence relation r generated from the System S, a larger
incidence relation r ◦ r among the industries of S will be easily got.
2.2

Establish Connected Incidence Relation

In the industrial system, the connotation of the relation is abundant while the
aﬀections among the industries are complex. From the perspective of inputoutput analysis, W.leontief’s anti-coeﬃcient can only reﬂect the strong and the
weak of industrial relation, but not the overall relation.
Besides, any kind of industrial development has double eﬀects. On one side, it
increases the supply and improves other industries’ developments. On the other
side, it stimulates the needs which drive other industries’ developments. For this
reason, we draw into the connected incidence relation R of the system S.

K.-y. Wu et al.

If rk = rk+1 establishes in r, then we name R = r ∪ r2 ∪ r3 ∪ · · · ∪ rk as the
connected incidence relation in S. In this expression rk indicates that there are
k compound calculation in r of S, that is rk = r ◦ r ◦ · · · ◦ r (here, k equals to
the number of r).
Because the industrial system S = {1, 2, 3, · · · , n} is a limited set, the transitive closure of r is t(r) = r ∪ r2 ∪ r3 ∪ · · · ∪ rn .When rk = rk+1 (k ≤ n),we
have
rk+2 = rk+1 ◦ r = rk ◦ r = rk+1 ,
rk+3 = rk+2 ◦ r = rk+1 ◦ r = rk ◦ r = rk+1 ,
··· ,
n
r = rk+1 .
In other words, rk = rk+1 = rk+2 = · · · = rn . Therefore, the connected
incidence relation R = r ∪ r2 ∪ r3 ∪ · · · ∪ rn .
Thus by adopting the famous Warshall’s algorithm to calculate the transitive
closure, we can quickly get the incidence relational matrix MR of the connected
incidence relation R.
If matrix MR = (cij )m×n already got through Warshall’s algorithm (Kolman,
2001), the set {j|cij = 1} is called the put industry set of j in the system, while
{j|cji = 1} is called the push industry set. Till now, a quite clear quantitative
result about the industrial relation in S will emerge.
2.3

Warshall’s Algorithm for Computing Transitive Closure

Warshall’s algorithm is an eﬃcient method for computing the transitive closure
of a relation, which based on the construction of a sequence of zero-one matrices.
These matrices are w0 , w1 , · · · , wn , where w0 = MR is the zero-one matrix of
[k]
this relation, and wk = [wij ].It can computes Mt(R) by eﬃciently computing
w0 = MR , w1 , w2 , · · · , wn = Mt(R) .
[k]
LEMMA: Let wk = [wij ] be the zero-one matrix that has a 1 in its (i, j)th
position if and only if there is a path from vi to vj with interior vertices from
[k−1]
[k−1]
[k−1]
k
= wij
∨ (wik
∧ wkj ), whenever i,jand
the set {v1 , v2 , · · · , vk }. Then wij
k are positive integers not exceeding n.
The Lemma give us the means eﬃciently to compute the matrices wk (k =
1, 2, · · · , n). We display psendocode for Warshall’s algorithm.
Procedure Warshall (MR : n × n zero-one matrix)
begin
w := MR
for k:=1 to n
begin
for j:=1 to n
wij = wij ∨ (wik ∧ wkj )
end
end.{w = [wij ] is Mt(R) }

The computational complexity of Warshall’s Algorithm can easily be com[k]
puted in term of bit operations. To ﬁnd the entry wij from the entries
[k−1]

[k−1]

[k−1]

wij ,wik
and wkj
using Lemma above requires two bit operations. To
ﬁnd all n2 entries of wk from those of wk−1 requires 2n2 bit operations. Since
warshall’s algorithm begins with w0 = MR and computes the sequences of
0 − 1 matrices w0 , w1 , · · · , wn = Mt(R) , the total number of bit operations is
n · 2n2 = 2n3 .

Analysis of Relation for Anhui Industrial System as a
Case

According to the 40 industrial departments classiﬁed in Anhui’s Input-output
Table in 1997 (Anhui’s Input-Output Oﬃce,1999) and the complete consuming
coeﬃcient table, we choose an appropriate communicative critical value α (here
α = 0.1) to establish the incidence relational matrix Mr , and to calculate MR
by Warshall operation is below(next page).
Based on the MR ,We can ﬁgure out the connected incidence relation of Industrial system directly in Anhui Province. The main results are attained as
followings.
(1) There’s a group of connected incidence relation in Anhui’s system.
S0 = {2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 24, 28, 33, 35},that is {Coal mining and selection industry,Petroleum and natural gas mining industry, Metal and nonmetal
mining and selection industry, Crude oil product and coke puriﬁcation industry,
Chemical industry, Metal puriﬁcation and metal products, machine-building industry, Electricity and Vapour products and supply, Freight transportation and
preservation, Financial insurance, Social service}.
The internal development and variation of this group can bring about the
relative changes in other industries and at the same time improve those industries
outside this group. For their strong overall functions, these industries can be
the motive of economic development, which serves as the pivot to maintain
economy’s stability, compatibility and its high pace.
(2)The group S0 includes resource,energy,service and other basic industries.In
developing point of view,these industries must have the privilege be developed,which will pave the way for the continual development of Anhui’s economy.
(3)Agriculture (industry code 1) is the basic industry that proposes a
particular status in Anhui.On one hand,it can improve the development of
food,textile,costume and other groups (code 6,7,8,10,22,29) and meanwhile pull
the development of the communicative connected group S0 ,so it fully displays
that Anhui is a big and strong agriculture province.
(4) Social service (industry code 35),especially the tourist industry,is very
important in Anhui.It can not only improve the development of S0 ,but also all
the other industry’s developments.
(5)Financial industry (industry code 35) has impact on all the industries
including S0 .It will do good to the whole nation’s economy.

(6)The essence of the dominant industry lies in its leading eﬀect in the industrial structure system.Anhui’s practical situation should be taken into account in
selecting the dominant industry.But on addition,the agriculture and social service which have special status should also be included.In this way,we can realize
the quick increase on the basis of the optimism of the industrial structure.

Conclusion

From the above-mentioned analysis, conclusions can be reached, the model based
on the binary relation theory and Warshall’s algorithm is eﬀective with simple
suﬃcient mathematical theories and convenient operation. And the model is
applied. By adopting the statistics of the input-output graph, through the computer programming, the connected incidence relation can be obtained quickly
under diﬀerent incidence critical value, which will oﬀer accurate reference for
the analysis of the connected eﬀects among diﬀerent industries as well as the
adjustment and optimism of the industrial structure.
