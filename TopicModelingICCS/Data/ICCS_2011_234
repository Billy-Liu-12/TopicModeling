Abstract
The author presents a new approximate pricing formula for the credit valuation adjustment of interest rate swap in
the SABR/LIBOR market model using an asymptotic expansion method. He compare it with Monte Carlo simulation.
It is shown that the new method makes computations extremely fast.
Keywords: CVA, SABR/LIBOR market model, Asymptotic expansion

1. Introduction
The counterparty risk management is becoming increasingly important after the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008 and the
tightening of the regulations ([3], [12]). Many ﬁnancial institutions are more interested in the credit valuation adjustment(CVA) of derivatives, but they have problems with the CVA especially in the calculation speed ([12]).
Most institutions cite interest rate products as contributing the most to their overall risk ([12]). In the interest rate
derivatives markets, the SABR model is widely used by practitioners in the ﬁnancial industry. The LIBOR market
model has become the market standard, and the SABR model can capture the volatility smile of interest rates ([4],
[6]).
In this paper, we consider about the CVA of the interest rate swap. It takes a lot of time to calculate the CVA of the
swap by Monte Carlo simulation. Using a new approach, this paper derives an approximate formula for the CVA of
the swap. This new formula enable to calculate the CVA much faster than Monte Carlo method. To obtain the formula,
we apply an asymptotic expansion method based on inﬁnite dimensional analysis called the Watanabe-Yoshida theory
and the Malliavin calculus ([10], [11]). The method was applied to derivative valuation problems ([7], [8], [5]).
The asymptotic expansion requires a huge amount of manipulation of symbolic expressions, so we develop a new
library for Maxima in Lisp. With this library, we can obtain high order asymptotic expansions of the solution to SDEs.
In the following sections, after an explanation of the framework of an asymptotic expansion method in Section 2,
Section 3 provide a brief description of the new library for maxima. Section 4 applies the method to the forward swap
rate. Section 5 gives the new approximate pricing formula for CVA of the interest rate swap and Section 6 provides
the accuracy validation by comparing the approximate formula with Monte Carlo simulation. Section 7 concludes.

where x0 is constant, W = W 1 , · · · , W d is an d-dimensional standard Brownian process, and
parameter. The following theorem is proved in [10].

Theorem 2.1. Suppose V0 : Rd × [0, 1] → Rd and V : Rd → Rd × Rm are smooth, and these derivatives of any order
are bounded. Next, suppose that a function g : Rd → R to be smooth and all derivatives have polynomial growth
orders. Then, for ↓ 0, g(XT( ) ) has its asymptotic expansion:
g(XT( ) ) = g0T + g1T +

3. Asymptotic expansion library for Maxima
We develop a library for the asymptotic expansion of the solution to SDEs in Maxima using lisp, the programming
language. So, we explain about Maxima, a computer algebra system, and the library in this section.
3.1. Maxima
Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical expressions, including diﬀerentiation and
integration, etc ([13]).
3.2. Asymptotic expansion library
To obtain the symbolic expressions of the asymptotic expansion, we extend Maxima to manipulate Ito’s integral,
Ito’s formula, Fubini’s theorem, the formula to calculate conditional expectations(Proposition 2.1), formulas to solve
SDEs, and the inversion formula of characteristic functions, etc.
We deﬁne these theorems and formulas in the library as follows.

stochastic diﬀerential equation :
dS t

=

(S t )B σt dWt1

(21)

=

v1 σt dWt1

(22)

+

v2 σt dWt2

where W = W 1 , W 2 is 2-dimensional standard Wiener process, and B ∈ [0, 1]. Let the correlation between forward
swap rate and its volatility be ρ ∈ [−1, 1], then v1 = vρ, v2 = v 1 − ρ2 where v ≥ 0.
Now, we calculate the asymptotic expansion of the solution to above SDE. (21), (22) are represented as follows:
S ( ) (T )

5. CVA of interest rate swap
Consider a payer swap such that a ﬁxed interest rate K is paid and a ﬂoating interest rate F(T i ; T i , T i+1 ), i =
a, . . . , b − 1, is received at the consecutive dates T a+1 , . . . , T b .
5.1. Basic setup
This subsection deﬁnes basic concepts such as tenor structures, discount bond price, the money market account,
forward Libor rates, the spot measure, the forward measure and the forward swap measure. First a tenor structure is
given by a ﬁnite set date:
0 = T0 < T1 < · · · < T N

Masahiro Nisiba. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1412–1421

1418

where T N is a pre-speciﬁed date and δ = T j − T j−1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , N. P(t, T j ) denotes the price of the the discount
bound with maturity T j at time t, where P(T j , T j ) = 1 and P(t, T j ) = 0 for t ∈ (T j , T N ].
The forward LIBOR rate at time t (≤ T j ) with term [T j−1 , T j ] is deﬁned as
1 P(t; T j−1 )
−1 ,
δ P(t; T j )

F(t; T j−1 , T J ) =

(31)

for any j = 1, 2, . . . , N.
The money market account’s price B(t) is deﬁned as
P(t; T γ(t) )
γ(t)
Π j=1 P(T j−1 ; T j )

B(t) =

(32)

where T γ(t) denotes the ﬁrst tenor after time t.
Let (Ω, F , Q) denote a complete probability space satisfying the usual conditions where Q is the spot measure
which is the risk neutral measure with numeraire B(t). Then, let QT and Q(a,b) be the T -forward measure and the
forward swap measure which are equivalent martingale measures with numeraire P(t; T ) and N(t) = bi=a+1 P(t, T i )
respectively.
5.2. Interest rate swaption
Let S (a,b) (t) denote the forward rate with term [T a , T b ] at time t (t ∈ [0, T a ]), and it is represented as follows:
P(t, T a ) − P(t, T b )

S (a,b) (t) =

(33)

The price of a payer swaption with nominal 1, strike K, maturity t and underlying tenor T a , T a+1 . . . T b (T a is the
ﬁrst reset date and T b the maturity of the underlying swap) is represented as follows:

CV A := (1 − R)EQ

B(t)−1 max (V(t), 0) dDP(t)

(35)

where R (R ∈ [0, 1]) and DP(t) denote the recovery rate and default probability respectively.
5.4. CVA of interest rate swap
We deﬁne the default probability DP(t) as
t

DP(t) = 1 − exp −
0

λ dt = 1 − exp (−λt) .

(36)

Masahiro Nisiba. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1412–1421

Let V(t) denote the price of the interest rate swap at time t. According to [1], its CVA is represented as follows:

are computed by Monte Carlo simulations. Let be 1, B = 0.5, δ = 0.5, a = 10, b = 20, K = (3.5%, 4%, 4.5%) and
R = 0. Other parameters used in the test are given in Table 1. The parameters are calibrated from market date in Table

The results (Table 3, Table 4) show the approximation error of the asymptotic expansions are relatively small to
nominal value 1. Moreover, the computational time of the new formula is much faster than that of the Monte Carlo
simulation (Table 5).
7. Conclusion
We have presented a new approximate formula for the CVA of the interest rate swap in the SABR/LIBOR market
model using an asymptotic expansion method. Numerical results show that our approximate formula is reasonablyaccurate compared with Monte Carlo method. And new formula can be calculated much faster then Monte Carlo
method.
Our future research topics are as follows: First, we apply this approach to more complicated default probability
models. Second, we apply the asymptotic expansion to the forward swap rate without freezing techniques. Third, we
derive the formulas for the other derivatives such as an American option.
