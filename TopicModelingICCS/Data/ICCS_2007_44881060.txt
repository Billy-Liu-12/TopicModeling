Introduction

This papers presents properties of spatial linear systems described by a certain
physical quantity generated by a diﬀerential equation. This quantity can be represented by internal electric or magnetic ﬁeld inside the material, by concentration or by similar physical or chemical quantities. A speciﬁc diﬀerential equation
generates this quantity considering as input the spatial alternating variations
of an internal parameter. As a consequence, speciﬁc spatial linear variations of
the observable output physical quantity appear. It is shown that in case of very
short range variations of this internal parameters, systems described by a differential equation able to generate a practical test-function exhibit an output
which appears to an external observer under the form of two distinct envelopes.
These can be considered as two distinct structural patterns located in the same
material along a certain linear axis.
In the ideal mathematical case, suddenly emerging pulses should be simulated
using test-functions (functions which diﬀer to zero only on a limited time interval
and possessing an inﬁnite number of continuous derivatives on the whole real
axis. However, as shown in [1], such test functions, similar to the Dirac functions,
can’t be generated by a diﬀerential equation. The existence of such an equation
of evolution, beginning to act at an initial moment of time, would imply the
necessity for a derivative of certain order to make a jump at this initial moment

of time from the zero value to a nonzero value. But this aspect is in contradiction
with the property of test-functions to have continuous derivatives of any order
on the whole real axis, represented in this case by the time axis. So it results
that an ideal test-function can’t be generated by a diﬀerential equation. For this
reason, the analysis must be restricted at practical test-functions [2], deﬁned
as functions which diﬀer to zero on a certain interval and possess only a ﬁnite
number of continuous derivatives on the whole real axis. Mathematical methods
based on diﬀerence equations are well known [3], but for a higher accuracy of the
computer simulation speciﬁc Runge-Kutta methods in Matlab are recommended.
The physical aspects of dynamical systems able to generate spatial practical
test-functions will be studied, for the case when the free-term of the diﬀerential
equation (corresponding to the internal parameter of material) is represented
by alternating functions. The shape of the output signal (obtained by numerical
simulations in Matlab based on Runge-Kutta functions) will be analyzed, being
shown that for very short range alternating inputs an external observer could
notice (in certain condition) the existence of two distinct envelopes corresponding
to two distinct structural patterns inside the material. Such aspect diﬀers to
the oscillations of unstable type second order systems studied using diﬀerence
equations [4], and they diﬀers also yo previous studies of the same author [5]
where the frequency response of such systems to alternating inputs was studied
(in conjunction with the ergodic hypothesis).

Equations Able to Generate Periodical Patterns

As it is known, a test-function on a spatial interval [a, b] is a function which
is nonzero on this interval and which possess an inﬁnite number of continuous
derivatives on the whole real axis. For example, the function
ϕ(x) =

exp ( x21−1 )
if
x ∈ (−1, 1)
0 otherwise

is a test-function on [−1, 1]. For a small value of the numerator of the exponent,
a rectangular shape of the output is obtained. An example is the case of the
function
if
x ∈ (−1, 1)
exp ( x0.1
2 −1 )
ϕ(x) =
0 otherwise
Using the expression of ϕ(x) and of its derivatives of ﬁrst and second order,
a diﬀerential equation which admits as solution the function ϕ corresponding to
a certain physical quantity can be obtained. However, a test-function can’t be
the solution of a diﬀerential equation. Such an equation of evolution implies a
jump at the initial space point for a derivative of certain order, and test-function
must possess continuous derivatives of any order on the whole real axis. So it
results that a diﬀerential equation which admits a test-function ϕ as solution can
generate only a practical test-function f similar to ϕ, but having a ﬁnite number
of continuous derivatives on the real Ox axis. In order to do this, we must add

initial conditions for the function f (generated by the diﬀerential equation) and
for some of its derivatives f (1) , and/or f (2) etc. equal to the values of the testfunction ϕ and of some of its derivatives ϕ(1) , and/or ϕ(2) etc. at an initial space
point xin very close to the beginning of the working spatial interval. This can
be written under the form

in

If we want to generate spatial practical test-functions f which are symmetrical
as related to the middle of the working spatial interval, we can choose as space
origin for the Ox axis the middle of this interval, and so it results that the
function f should be invariant under the transformation
x → −x
Functions invariant under this transformation can be written in the form f (x2 ),
(similar to aspects presented in [2]) and so the form of a general second order
diﬀerential equation generating such functions must be

d (x2 )

+ a1 x2

df
+ a0 x2 f = 0

However, for studying the generation of structural pattersns on such a working
interval, we must add a free-term, corresponding to the internal parameter of
the material (the cause for the variations of the external obersvable physical
quntity). Thus, a model for generating a practical test-function using as input
the internal parameter u = u(x), x ∈ [−1, 1], is

which are the boundary conditions of a practical test-function. For u represented
by aletrnating functions, we should notice periodical variations of the external
observable phusical quantity f .

According to previous considerations for the form of a diﬀerential equation invariant at the transformation
x → −x
a ﬁrst order system can be written under the form

representing a ﬁrst order dynamical system. For a periodical input (corresponding to the internal parameter) u = sin 10x, numerical simulations performed
using Runge-Kutta functions in Matlab present an output of an irregular shape
(ﬁgure 1), not suitable for joining together the outputs for a set of adjoining
linear intervals (the value of f at the end of the interval diﬀers in a signiﬁcant
manner to the value of f at the beginning of the interval). A better form for the
physical quantity f is obtained for variations of the internal parameter described
by the equation u = cos 10x. In this case the output is symmetrical as related to
the middle of the interval (as can be noticed in ﬁgure 2) and the results obtained
on each interval can be joined together on the whole linear spatial axis, without any discontinuities to appear. The resulting output would be represented by
alternances of two great oscillations (one at the end of an interval and another
one at the beginning of the next interval) and two small oscillations (around the
middle of the next interval).

Connection with the Ergodic Hypothesis

When the internal parameter presents very short range variations, some new
structural patterns can be noticed. Considering an alternating input of the form
u = sin(100x), it results an observable physical quantity f represented in ﬁgure 3; for an alternating cosine input representd by u = cos(100x), it results
the output f represented in ﬁgure 4. Studying these two graphics, we can notice
the presence of two distinct envelopes. Their shape depends on the phase of the

origin. At ﬁrst sight, an external observer could notice two distinct functions f
inside the same material, along the Ox axis. These can be considered as two
distinct structural patterns located in the same material, generated by a short
range alternating internal parameter u through a certain diﬀerential equation
(invariant at the transformation x → −x).

Conclusions

This papers has presented properties of spatial linear systems described by a
certain physical quantity generated by a diﬀerential equation. A speciﬁc diﬀerential equation generates this quantity considering as input the spatial alternating
variations of an internal parameter. As a consequence, speciﬁc spatial linear variations of the observable output physical quantity appear. It was shown that in
case of very short range variations of this internal parameters, systems described
by a diﬀerential equation able to generate a practical test-function exhibit an
output which appears to an external observer under the form of two distinct envelopes. These can be considered as two distinct structural patterns located in
the same material along a certain linear axis. By this study, a fundamental new
interpretation based on spatial aspects has been obtained for graphics previously
obtained for non-linear equations of evolution [5] (the novelty of this study being
justiﬁed).
