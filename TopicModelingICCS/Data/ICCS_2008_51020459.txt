Abstract. This work applied data analysis method of attribute reduction to the
credit risk evaluation indicators selection of the emerging technical firms
(ETF), and constructed the ETF’s credit risk evaluation indicators system.
Furthermore, the utilization the distinct matrix method was carried out the
confirmation to the reduction result. Finally the 7 ETF's data was used to carry
out the analysis in the western of China by attribute reduction and their core
attribute was obtained.
Keywords: ETF, credit risk, evaluation indicators, attribute reduction.

1 Introduction
The Rough Set theory was proposed by Pawley Z in 1982. In 1991 Pawley Z published
a monograph which elaborated the RS theory comprehensively and established a strict
mathematical foundation for it. However, there is little information available in literature about the application of attribute reduction method to the research for the credit
risk of emerging technology firms.
Our work is thus devoted to adopting the attribute reduction in the ETF's credit risk
indicator selection as an application of RS. The work was carried out on reducing the
condition attribute of the ETF’s credit risk evaluation indicator. Firstly, the credit risk
evaluation indicator of the common firms was referenced. Then, in view of ETF, its
condition attribute value was separated, and the redundant ingredient was removed by
the attribute reduction algorithm. Finally, group of ETF’s credit risk evaluation indicator was obtained.
The indicator attributes provide a support for the scientific management, the forecast, and the decision-making for the ETF.

2 Attribute Reduction
2.1 Data Discretization
This work employed the impoved greedy algorithm which does not have the policy-making condition ([1]).
An information system S can be represented as: S = (U, R, V, F). Here, U = {x1,
x2,…,xn} which denotes the universe of discourse is a non-empty limited set. R=C D
is the attribute set, subset C and D is called the condition attribute and the policy-making attribute respectively. Va ∈ [la, ra] indicates the value territory of attribute a,
la= c1a c2a c3a…… cna=ra. Va=[ c1a, c2a
[ c2a, c3a
…… [ cn-1a, cna . the c1a,
a
a
c2 , ……, cn are called the breakpoint. The arbitrary breakpoint in Va is assembled in
the interest of {(a,c1a),(a,c2a),…,(a,cna)}. And for a, cia R.
Let S*=(U*,R*,V*,F*) be a new information system. In it, U*={(xi,xj) U×U}
R*={Pra| a C}. Here, the Pra is the r-th breakpoint of a. As for arbitrary Pra, in case
(Cra, Cr+1a) ⊆{min [a(xi), a(xj)], max [a(xi), a(xj)]}, a(xi) expresses the i-th attribute
value of a. In that way Pra((xi,xj))=1 otherwise Pra((xi,xj))=0. Pra((xi,xj)) denotes acing
according to the element (xi,xj) with the r-th breakpoint substituting of attribute a. Step
as follows:

，

1. Information table S on the basis of former constitutes new information table S*;
2. The initial breakpoint set is a empty set;
3. When only one breakpoint the row 1 value integer many, select all rows 1
value integer most breakpoints join to the breakpoint, remove the row and in this
breakpoint which this breakpoint is at the value are 1 line; When has above same the
breakpoint row 1 value integer, corresponds a row institute the break point row value
is 1 line 1 integer adds together, takes is the breakpoint which sum of the line value
is smallest.
4. If recent information table is not empty, go to third step, otherwise stop.
2.2 The Attribute Reduction
Information system S can be expressed by S = (U,R,V,F). Here the F: U ×R →V denotes
a mapping from U×R to V. Suppose R is a equal in value relational bunch on U, then
IND(R) expressed on U are all equal in value kinds which derives by R.
If r R and IND(R)=IND(R-{r}), then r is called in R the condition attribute which
can be removed; If IND(R)≠IND(R-{r}), then r is called the condition attribute which
should not drop out from R.
The removable condition attribute in the indicator system is unnecessary if removing
them from the indicator system will not change this indicator system in classified
ability. On the contrary, if in the indicator system removes the condition attribute which
should not be droped out, then the classified ability of the indicator system will certainly change. If any r R is not droped out from R, then equal value relates bunch of R
is independent; otherwise R is related. The condition attribute in which R should not be
droped out is called the core attribute.

In the ordinary status, an information system reduction continues one kind. This
reduction has approximately maintained same classification ability to the original
condition attribute. The simplification distinct matrix method is introduced for computating the reduction more effectively. Step as follows:
1. The initial data discretization produced the knowledge information table;
2. Observe object whether there is the same attribute condition and can't be distinguished; delete object which has the same attribute condition and cannot be distinguished;
3. Directly pick up the distinct HFS[3]of the first object from the information system to be opposite to other objects, and reduction;
4. Is opposite front in turn the object to other objects withdraws distinct HFS and
adds on to be distinct HFS, and reduction;
5. Finally, obtain the reduction of information system.

3 ETF’s Credit Risk Evaluation Indicator System
The emerging technology which refers to these recently to appear or to develop, has an
important influence on the economic structure or the profession development. The ETF
with high degree of concentration manpower, the intelligence and the technological
resource complex compound, has the high risk, high incertitude and the high defeat rate
characteristic.
In previous literature, the majority conerned emerging technical aspect and so on
firm’s concept.While management conducted the research to ETF’s credit risk research
is extremely few. The [6] mainly induced the influence of emerging technology firms
credit risk some important characteristics from the system risk and the non- system risk
two aspects.
This research is based on the indicator selection systematic characteristic, the scientific nature, may be operational, objective as well as the quota and decides the disposition union the principle, through to the ETF investigation and the analysis, induces
from the multitudinous indicator distinguishes between the traditional profession, the
prominent characteristic of ETF’s credit risk evaluation indicator, it including the profit
ability, pays off a debt the ability, the business capacity, the innovation ability and the
market competition strength.
Where the profit ability is reflected by the indicator such as transport business profit
margin, the total assets reward rate, the net assets income rate, the new product income
increase ratio, and the firms goodwill. The pay-off ability of a debt is reflected by the
indicator like property debt rate, liquidity ratio, cash current capacity ratio, and Quick
assets ratio. The business capacity is reflected by the indicators as the total assets velocity, the account receivable velocity, income rate of increment, the new product sale
personnel ratio, the superintendent manage the level. The innovation ability is reflected
by the indicators such as the R&D expense accounts for the sales income ratio, researches and develops the personnel ratio, the new equipment rate, master above cultural staff population, invisible asset possessing rate. The firms goodwill is reflected by
the indicator like customer quantity, new product life cycle, product strain strength,

new product quantity. The significance of these indicators are different. There inevitably be some relevance and duplication between the indicators.
This work adopts the data analysis method of the attribute reduction and the distinct
matrix method, and seeks the simple and effective attribute set. The ETF credit risk
evaluation indicator system is constructed as thus.

The attribute reduction was removed through the attribute one by one. The profit
ability indicator concreted the reduction operation as follows:
First step: Attribute value discretization. The result is in table 2.
Second step: Delete the redundant attribute condition.

Y. Zhang, Z. Zhou, and Y. Shi

In table 2, new product income increase ratio and the firms goodwill income attribute value quite same not less than, explained their classified ability is same, deletes
a attribute condition not to affect the classified result, deletes the firms goodwill income
attribute.
Third step: Attribute value reduction.
Universe of discourse U= {A, B, C, D, E, F}, attribute condition set R= {a, b, c, d,
e}; IND(R)={{A} {B} {C} {D} {E} {F}}, IND(R-{a})={{A} {B, E} {C} {D}
{F}≠IND(R). The attribute a was removed to change the information table classified
ability. Therefore attribute a is the core attribute which cannot be dropt out.

According to that U={A,B,C,D,E,F} is attribute condition set R={a,b,c,d,e},
IND(R)={{A}{B}{C}{D}{E}{F}}, IND{R-{a}}={{A}{B,E}{C}{D}{F}}≠IND{R}.
Getting rid of attribute a revised the information table classification capability. The
same principle may result in IND(R-{b})={{A, E} {B} {C} {D} {F}}≠IND{R}. Here b
is the core attribute which cannot be dropt out. IND{R-{c}}={{A, C} {B} {D} {E}
{F}}≠IND{R}, c also can not be dropt out. IND{R-{d}}={{A}{B}{C,F}{D}
{E}}≠IND{R}, d is also the core attribute, and the profit capability core attribute set is
{a,b,c,d}.
Using the distinct matrix to the profit ability carries on attribute reduction resulted
the same and confirmed the above method results.
Utilizing the method above to the business capacity, the innovation ability and the
market competition strength separately carried out attribute reduction. Finally their
core attribute was obtained.
The business capacity including the total assets velocity, the account receivable
velocity, the superintendent manages level; the innovation ability accounts for the sales
income ratio including the R&D expense, researches and develops the personnel ratio,
the new equipment rate, invisible asset possessing rate; market competition strength
including customer quantity, new product life cycle, product strain strength.
