Abstract. This paper studies Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) with
multiple losses. We introduce the concept of α-CVaR for the case
of multiple losses under the conﬁdence level vector α. The α-CVaR
indicates the conditional expected losses corresponding to the α-VaR.
The problem of solving the minimal α-CVaR results in a multiobjective
problem (MCVaR). In order to get Pareto eﬃcient solutions of the
(MCVaR), we introduce a single objective problem (SCVaR) and show
that the optimal solutions of the (SCVaR) are the Pareto eﬃcient
solutions of (MCVaR).
Keywords: Credit risk, Loss functions, α-CVaR, Pareto eﬃcient solutions

Introduction

Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a measure for the potential loss in the ﬁnancial market.
With respect to a speciﬁed probability level α, the α-VaR of a portfolio is the
lowest amount y such that, with probability α, the loss will not exceed y. VaR
has achieved its great success in practice. However, research shows that VaR has
undesirable properties both in theory and in practice. The main undesirable characteristics are as follows [1]. (a) There are various methodologies for modeling
VaR, such as Historical Simulation, Monte Carlo, Extreme Value Theory, but
the results using these methodologies are discrepant. (b) It is diﬃcult to solve directly the problem of optimizing VaR. (c) VaR dissatisﬁes sub-additivity, which
leads that ﬁnancial organizations cannot obtain the whole VaR from those of
their branches. (d) It is computed the loss exceeding VaR with likehood (1 − α),

but no information is provided on the amount of the excess loss,which may be
signiﬁcantly greater.
The concept of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) ([2]) was presented mainly
to solve the problem of sub-additivity. With a speciﬁed probability α, the αCVaR is the conditional expectation of losses above the VaR. CVaR overcomes
several limitations of VaR and has good properties, especially its good computability. Recently, there are several studies on CVaR area. Chernozhukov and
Umantsev in [3] stressed the important aspects of measuring the external and
intermediate conditional risk and gave an empirical application characterizing
the key economic determinants of various levels of conditional risk. Andersson,
Mausser, Rosen et al. in [4] presented an eﬃcient algorithm to minimize CVaR.
Rockafellar and Uryasev [5] derived some fundamental properties of conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) for loss distributions in Finance that can involve discreetness.
However, the losses that should be considered in practical risk management
are often multiple, such as those due to interest risk, exchange risk, shares
risk, commercial risk. So, the risk management problems are of multiobjective.
Krokhmal, Palmquist and Uryasev [6] and Wang and Li [7] solve eﬃcient frontier
problems with three losses under the framework of CVaR. However, they did not
concern in theoretical studies.
This paper will study the multiple conditional VaR. After introducing the
concept of α-VaR with conﬁdence level vector α of a portfolio for multi losses
based on the paper [2], we deﬁne α-CVaR as the conditional expected losses
above the α-VaR. We then present the optimization problem of minimizing the
multiple α-CVaR as a multiple programming. We prove that under some conditions the multiple α-CVaR problem can be transformed into a single objective
nonlinear programming problem, which can be solved relative simply.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce the concept of α-CVaR and the main results of paper [2]. Then, in
Section 3, we deﬁne the multiple α-CVaR. In Section 4, we show the main
results of solving the multiple α-CVaR. Section 5 gives the conclusions.

CVaR with Single Loss

Rockfellar and Uryasev [2] discussed the CVaR model with single loss. Their
main concepts and results are as follows.
Let x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )T be the portfolio, which is also called the decision
vector, with x ∈ X and X ⊂ Rn . Let f (x, ξ) : Rn × Rm → R1 be the loss
associated with the decision vector x, where ξ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , ξm )T is a random
vector representing the uncertainties that aﬀect the loss. For simplicity, it is assumed that ξ is a continuously random variable with p.d.f. p(z). The cumulative
distribution function of f (x, ξ) is denoted by
Ψ (x, y) = P {f (x, ξ) ≤ y} =

f (x,z)≤y

p(z)dz,

which is nondecreasing and right continuous in y for each x ∈ X.

Deﬁnition 2.1 Given α ∈ (0, 1) and x ∈ X, the α-VaR (of the loss) associated with the decision x under the conﬁdence level α is deﬁned by
yα (x) = min{y ∈ R : Ψ (x, y) ≥ α},

(1)

which is the lowest amount y such that, with probability α, the loss will not
exceed y. Moreover, α-CVaR (of the loss) associated with x under α is deﬁned
by
φα (x) = (1 − α)−1

f (x,z)≥yα (x)

f (x, z)p(z)dz.

(2)

φα (x) is the conditional expectation of the loss associated with x relatively to
that loss being the α-VaR yα (x) or greater. It is diﬃcult to work directly with
the α-CVaR because of unknowing yα (x). Rockfellar and Uryasev introduced a
simpler function:
Fα (x, y) = y + (1 − α)−1

z∈R

[f (x, z) − y]+ p(z)dz,

(3)

where t+ = max(0, t).
Lemma 2.1 As a function of y, Fα (x, y) is convex, continuously diﬀerentiable
and
∂
Fα (x, y) = (1 − α)−1 [Ψα (x, y) − α].
∂y
Under the condition of
P {f (x, ξ) = y} =

p(z)dz = 0,

(4)

f (x,z)=y

the following result is shown.
Theorem 2.1 Minimizing the α-CVaR φα (x) over x ∈ X is equivalent to
minimizing Fα (x, y) over (x, y) ∈ X × R, in the sense that
min
Fα (x, y).
min φ (x) =
x∈X α
(x,y)∈X×R
Furthermore, Fα (x, y) is convex with respect to (x, y) and φα (x) is convex with
respect to x when f (x, y) is convex with respect to x. In this case, if X is a
convex set, the above joint minimization is a convex programming.
According to Theorem 2.1, for the purpose of determining an x that yields
the minimum α-CVaR, it is not necessary to minimize directly the function
φα (x) which may be hard to do. Instead, one can operate on the far simpler
function Fα (x, y).
Theorem 2.1 opens the door to minimize α-CVaR over x ∈ X and so we can
use it to solve practical risk management problems.

CVaR with Multiple Losses

In this section, we generalize the concepts of α-VaR and α-CVaR into the case
of multiple losses.
Let fi (x, ξ) ∈ Rn × Rm → R1 (i = 1, 2, · · · , I) be the loss functions which
depends upon the decision vector x ∈ X ⊂ Rn and the random vector ξ ∈ Rm .
X is the set of possible portfolios. For simplicity, we assume that ξ is a random
variable with the probability density function p(z). However, this assumption is
not critical for our discussions in the following. Denote by Ψi (x, ·) the distribution
function of the loss fi (x, ξ), i.e.,
Ψi (x, y) = P {fi (x, ξ) ≤ y} =

p(z)dz,

i = 1, 2, · · · , I.

(5)

fi (x,z)≤y

We give the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.1 Given αi ∈ (0, 1), i = 1, 2, · · · , I, and x ∈ X, the α-VaR (of
the loss) associated with x under the conﬁdence level vector α = (α1 , α2 , · · · , αI )
is deﬁned by
y ∗ (x) = min{y | Ψi (x, y) ≥ αi , i = 1, 2, · · · , I}.

(6)

When I = 1, the α-VaR is exactly the α-VaR for one loss deﬁned by Deﬁnition 2.1. For i = 1, 2, · · · , I, Ψi (x, y) ≥ αi , or P {fi (x, ξ) ≤ y} ≥ αi , means that,
with probability αi , the ith loss will not exceed y for the portfolio x. So,
yi∗ (x) = min{y | Ψi (x, y) ≥ αi }
is the αi -VaR of x for the ith loss. Therefore, the α-VaR y ∗ (x) for a portfolio x
is the lowest amount y such that ith loss will not exceed y with probability αi
for each i. Clearly, when Ψi (x, y) is nondecreasing and continuous in y, yi∗ (x) is
the smallest root of the equation Ψi (x, y) = αi .
Obviously, given the conﬁdence level vector α = (α1 , α2 , · · · , αI ), y ∗ (x) is
the maximum of the αi -VaR, i.e., y ∗ (x) = max{y1∗ (x), y2∗ (x), · · · , yI∗ (x)}.
When we discuss α-VaR of x, we want to know how much the expected losses
of VaR is. For each i = 1, 2, · · · , I, we deﬁne
φαi (x, y) = (1 − αi )−1

fi (x, z)p(z)dz.

(7)

fi (x,z)≥y

Then, we have
φαi (x, y) = (1 − αi )−1 P {fi (x, ξ) ≥ y}E{fi (x, ξ) | fi (x, ξ) ≥ y}.
When y = yi∗ (x), P {fi (x, ξ) ≥ yi∗ (x)} = αi and so φαi (x, yi∗ (x)) = E{fi (x, ξ) |
fi (x, ξ) ≥ yi∗ (x)} is exactly the conditional expected ith loss for the portfolio x. Thus we use φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) to approximate the conditional expected
ith loss for x and αi under the loss y ∗ (x). It describes the risk of the portfolio x for the ith loss. If φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) is small, the risk will be also small.

927

Hence, (φα1 (x, y ∗ (x)), φα2 (x, y ∗ (x)), · · · , φαI (x, y ∗ (x))) describes the conditional expected losses under the α-VaR y ∗ (x) for the portfolio x and the conﬁdence
level vector α.
Deﬁnition 3.2 For given αi ∈ (0, 1), i = 1, 2, · · · , I, and x ∈ X, we call the
vector (φα1 (x, y ∗ (x)), φα2 (x, y ∗ (x)), · · · , φαI (x, y ∗ (x))) the α-CVaR associated
with x under the conﬁdence level vector α = (α1 , · · · , αI ).
It is not easy to compute φαi (x, y). Thus we introduce another loss function
as in [2]. For i = 1, 2, · · · , I, we deﬁne
Fαi (x, y) = y + (1 − αi )−1

[fi (x, z) − y]+ p(z)dz.

(8)

z∈R

By Lemma 2.1, we have the following result under the condition that all the loss
functions satisfy (4), i.e., P {fi (x, ξ) = y} = 0 for i = 1, 2, · · · , I.
Lemma 3.1 For each i = 1, 2, · · · , I, Fαi (x, y) is a continuous diﬀerential
and convex function, and
min Fαi (x, y) = φαi (x, yi∗ (x)),
y∈R

∂Fαi (x, y)
= (1 − αi )−1 [Ψαi (x, y) − αi ].

Main Results

We need to consider the minimal α-CVaR of x ∈ X. That is, we face the
following multiobjective problem:
(MCVaR) min (φα1 (x, y ∗ (x)), φα2 (x, y ∗ (x)), · · · , φαI (x, y ∗ (x)))
s. t. x ∈ X.
We ﬁrst introduce the concept of eﬃcient solutions in mutliobjective problems. Consider a multiobjective problem ([8])
(MP) min (h1 (y), h2 (y), · · · , hI (y))
s. t. y ∈ Y,
with hi : Rm → R, 1 = 1, 2, · · · , I and Y ⊂ Rm . For y ∗ ∈ Y , if there is no y ∈ Y
such that
h1 (y) ≤ h1 (y ∗ ), h2 (y) ≤ h2 (y ∗ ), · · · , hI (y) ≤ hI (y ∗ )
where at least one inequality is strict, then y ∗ is called a Pareto eﬃcient solution
to (MP).
For the given α = (α1 , α2 , · · · , αI ), if x∗ is a Pareto eﬃcient solution to
(MCVaR), then (φα1 (x∗ , y ∗ (x∗ )), φα2 (x∗ , y ∗ (x∗ )), · · · , φαI (x∗ , y ∗ (x∗ ))) is called

a Pareto-α-CVaR and x∗ is called a Pareto-α-CVaR eﬃcient solution. The set
of all Pareto-α-CVaR eﬃcient solutions is denoted by E(α). In the following,
we want to ﬁnd out such an eﬃcient solution.
It is diﬃcult to compute φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) from (7), so do (MCVaR). Therefore,
we should consider other problems. First, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1 For each x ∈ X and y ∈ R, we have that
φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) ≤ Fαi (x, y),

i = 1, 2, · · · , I.

(11)

Proof. Since that φαi (x, y) is nonincreasing in y, we have that
φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) ≤ φαi (x, yi∗ (x)).

(12)

Then by Lemma 3.1, we obtain (11).
✷
For the given weight 0 < λi < 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , I, we consider the problem
I

min

y∈R i=1

λi Fαi (x, y), for which we have the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1 Let x ∈ X. Suppose that y is an optimal solution to the
I

problem min

y∈R i=1

λi Fαi (x, y) and satisﬁes the condition
P {fi (x, ξ) = y} = 0,

Then

I

i = 1, 2, · · · , I.

(13)

λi Fαi (x, y).

(14)

I

λi φαi (x, y) = min
y∈R

i=1

Proof. Let F (x, y) =
I

i=1

I
i=1

λi Fαi (x, y). By Lemma 3.1, we have that

λi (1 − αi )−1 (Ψi (x, y) − αi ) = 0.

(15)

i=1

With this and (7), we have
I

I

λi Fαi (x, y) =
i=1

I

λi φαi (x, y) + y
i=1

which together with (15) implies (14).

λi (1 − αi )−1 (Ψi (x, y) − αi ),

i=1

✷

When fi (x, ξ) is a continuous random variable, the condition (13) must be
true. But, when fi (x, ξ) is a discrete type random variable, (13) holds if and
only if that y is not in the range of fi (x, ξ).
Now, suppose that Ψi (x, y) is strictly increasing in y. By Lemma 4.1 and
Theorem 4.1, we have the following results.
Corollary 4.1 Under the conditions given in Theorem 4.1, y = y ∗ (x) if and
only if
Ψi (x, y) − αi = 0,
i = 1, 2, · · · , I.

Corollary 4.2 For any x ∈ X,
I

λi φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) ≤ min
y∈R

i=1

I

λi Fαi (x, y).

(17)

i=1

I

Moreover, if the problem min

y∈R i=1

λi Fαi (x, y) has an optimal solution y that

satisﬁes (13) and (16), then the inequality (17) becomes an eqality.
Based on the above discussions, we now consider the following single objective
problem.
I

min

λi Fαi (x, y),

(18)

i=1

s. t. y ∈ R, x ∈ X.
We have the following theorem to relate this single objective problem to the
multiobjective problem (MCVaR).
Theorem 4.2 If (x, y) is an optimal solution to (18) and y satisﬁes (13) and
(16) for x = x, then x is a Pareto-α-CVaR eﬃcient solution to (MCVaR).
Proof. If (x, y) is an optimal solution to (18), then due to Corollary 4.2, x
I

is also an optimal solution to min
λ φ (x, y ∗ (x)). Therefore, by the theory
x∈X i=1 i αi
of mutliobjective programming, x is also a Pareto eﬃcient solution to (MCVaR)
([8]). Hence, the theorem is true.
✷
The remained problem is that the condition (16) is too serious. For this, we
consider the following single objective problem:
I

(SCVaR) min

λi Fαi (x, y),
i=1

s. t. y ∈ R, x ∈ X,
I

0 ≤ λi ≤ 1,

λi = 1.
i=1

The diﬀerence between this programming with (18) is that {λi , i = 1, 2, · · · , I}
are give in (18) while are decision variables here. The function by letting λi be
decision variables is to delete condition (16). Let
I

Λ = {λ = (λ1 , λ2 , · · · , λI ) | λi ∈ [0, 1], i = 1, 2, · · · , I,

λi = 1}
i=1

We have the following better result.
∗
Theorem 4.3 Suppose that Ψi (x, y) is strictly increasing in y. If (x∗ , y ∗ , λ )
∗
is an optimal solution to (SCVaR) and satisﬁes (13), then x is a Pareto-α-CVaR
eﬃcient solution to (MCVaR).

930

M. Jiang, Q. Hu, and Z. Meng

Proof. For λ ∈ Λ, let
y ∗ (x, λ) = min{y |

I

λi (1 − αi )−1 Ψi (x, y) ≥

i=1

I

λi αi (1 − αi )−1 }.

i=1

We show that
I

min
x∈X

i=1

λ∗i φαi (x, y ∗ (x)) = min min min
x∈X λ∈Λ y∈R

I

λi Fαi (x, y).

(19)

i=1

∗

From (19), if (x∗ , y ∗ , λ ) is an optimal solution to (SCVaR), we know from
Theorem 4.2 that x∗ is a Pareto-α-CVaR eﬃcient solution to (MCVaR).
✷
Therefore, in order to solve the multiobjective problem (MCVAR), we need
only to solve the single objective problem (SCVAR), which can be solved clearly
not too diﬃcult.

Conclusion

This paper discusses the CVaR problem with multiple losses. We introduce
the concepts of α-VaR and α-CVaR with the conﬁdence level vector α =
(α1 , α2 , · · · , αI ). It is shown that obtaining Pareto eﬃcient solutions of the minimal α-CVaR can be transformed into solving a single objective problem under
some mild conditions. This paper resolves the problem of multiobjective CVaR in
theory, and provides the theory base to numerical calculate and help us to study
theory and solution of multiobjective CVaR problems under others deﬁnitions
of α-VaR furthermore.
