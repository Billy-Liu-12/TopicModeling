Abstract. The authors designed a rotating parallel-plate capacitor; one
of the plates is assumed to turn about the common vertical axis through
the centers of the square plates. We insert this capacitor into a series
with a resistor, forming a RC circuit. We analyze the characteristics of
charging and discharging scenarios on two diﬀerent parallel tracks. On
the ﬁrst track we drive the circuit with a DC power supply. On the second
track, we drive the circuit with an AC source.
The analyses of the circuits encounter non-linear diﬀerential equations. We format the underlying equations into their generic forms. We
then apply Mathematica [1], NDSolve to solve them. This work is an example showing how with the help of Mathematica one is able to augment
the scope of the traditional studies.
Keywords: Mathematica, Electric Network, Geometry.

Introduction and Motivation

It is a far-fetched concept to think about a transient electrical circuit and incorporate its characteristics to a discrete and abstract geometrical problem. The
authors have even taken the initiative one step further, relating these two basic concepts to the kinematics of mechanics. In other words, this article shows
how these three discrete concepts are brought together and molded into one
coherent and unique project. To accomplish this, one needs to think creatively,
Mathematica is the tool of choice helping to explore the possibilities. This article
including the Introduction is composed of eight sections. In Section 2, we apply
Mathematica to evaluate the overlapping area of the two rotating squares about
their common vertical axis. In section 3 we incorporate the rotational kinematics
and consider two diﬀerent scenarios: 1) a symmetrical, uniform rotation; and 2)
an asymmetrical, accelerated rotation.
In Section 4-7, we view the overlapping squares as being two parallel metallic
plates that are separated by a gap forming a parallel-plate capacitor. Since the

area of the overlapping plates evaluates the capacitance of the capacitor, the rotating plates make the capacitor a variable one. Technical literature particularly
Mathematica-based articles and reports lack one such view. It is the ultimate
objective of this project to analyze the response of the electrical circuits to the
kinematics of the rotating plates.
Speciﬁcally, in this article, we address the modiﬁcations of the basic responses
of the electrical circuits composed of a resistor connected in a series with our
designed, time-dependent capacitor. In particular, we analyze the characteristics
of the RC circuits driven with DC as well as AC sources. In conjunction with
our analysis, in section 8 we close the article suggesting a few related research
ﬂavored circuit analysis projects.

Analysis

Figure 1 shows two identical overlapping squares. The bottom square designated
with non-prime vertices is fastened to the xy coordinate system. The top square,
designated with prime vertices is rotated counter clockwise about the common
vertical axis through the common origin O by an angle θ. The squares have the
side length of L and the rotation angle θ is the angle between the semi diagonals
OP 1 and OP 1 .
To evaluate the overlapping area of these two squares we evaluate the area
of trapezoid oabco; the overlapping area then equals four times the latter. The
intersecting points of the rotated sides of the top square with the sides of the
bottom one are labeled a, b, and c. Utilizing the coordinates of these points,
the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of two triangles abc, and oac.

To evaluate the coordinates of a, b, and c we write the equations for the
slanted lines, P4 P1 and P1 P2 and intersect them with the sides of the bottom
square. Intersection of the former with the P4 P1 and P1 P2 gives the coordinates
of a and b respectively. Similarly, the intersection of the latter with P1 P2 yields
the coordinates of c. Theses are: a

We divide the overlapping area by the area of the square, L2 , and plot its
normalized values as a function of the rotation angle θ. Figure 2 shows the
normalized area starts and ends at the same values. Its value after a π4 radian
turn drops to about 83% of the maximum value. The plot as one anticipates is
symmetric about π4 .

Modes of Mechanical Rotations

In this section we extend the analysis of Section 2. Here, instead of viewing the
rotation as being a discrete and purely geometrical concept, we view it as a
kinematic process. We set the rotation angle θ = ωt; that is, we introduce the
continuous time parameter t. For ω = 2π
T with the period T = 4s, we explore

the uniform rotation. For an asymmetrical case, we consider a rotation with a
constant angular acceleration. According to θ = 12 αt2 , to rotate the square by

areas are displayed in Fig 3.

Electrical Networks

Now we consider a RC series circuit. One such circuit driven by a DC power
supply is shown in Figure 4. The circuit is composed of two loops. Throwing the
DPDT (Double-Pole Double-Throw) switch to as position charges the capacitor,
while setting the switch to a bs discharges the charged capacitor.
As we pointed out in the Introduction, in this section we view the overlapping
squares as being two parallel metallic plates that are separated by a gap forming

as charges the capacitor, while throwing the switch onto bs discharges the charged
capacitor.

a parallel-plate capacitor. Since the capacitor of a parallel-plate capacitor is in
proportion to the overlapping area of the plates, the continuous rotation of the
plates makes the capacitor time-dependent. It is the objective of this section to
analyze the characteristic responses of one such time-dependent capacitor in the
charging and discharging processes.

For the sake of convenience, we assume V C0 = 1, where C0 is the capacitance
of the parallel-plate with the plates completely overlapped, Q(t) and A(t) are
the capacitor’s charge and the overlapping area at time t, respectively; A0 is
the area of one of the squares; and τ = RC0 is the time-constant of the circuit.
For a constant capacitor A(t) ≡ A0 , and eq(1) yields the standard solution
t
Q(t) = 1 − e− τ . In this equation the maximum charge is normalized to unity.
For the rotating plates, however, eq(1) does not have an analytic solution.
We apply Mathematica NDSolve along with an appropriate initial condition and
solve the equation numerically – this yields Q(t). We graphically compare its
characteristics vs. the characteristics of an equivalent RC circuit, see Fig 5.
Similarly, we analyze the characteristics of the discharging process. Equation
1 A0
(1) for the corresponding discharging process is dQ(t)
dt + τ A(t) Q(t) = 0. This

equation for a constant capacitor, A0 = A(t), yields dQ(t)
dt + τ Q(t) = 0, and
t
gives Q(t) = e− τ . For the rotating capacitor, however, its solution is Q(t) =
A0

e− τ 0 A(ξ) dξ . To solve the latter we apply Mathematica NIntegrate. This yields
the needed values. The results are displayed in Fig 5.

curves/dots represent the constant and time-dependent capacitors, respectively. The
far right graph is borrowed from Fig 3.

It is interesting to note that the charging and discharging circuits respond
diﬀerently to the time-varying capacitors; the impact of the time-dependent

capacitor is more pronounced for the former. Moreover, for the chosen timeconstant τ = 16 s, although the constant capacitor reaches its plateau within one
second, it appears the variable capacitor requires a longer time span.

accelerated rotating plates. The graph codes are the same as Fig 5. The far right graph
is borrowed from Fig 3.

To form an opinion about the characteristics of the charging curve for the
variable capacitor, one needs to view it together with the far right graph. The
rotating plates in this case are accelerated, illustrating that for identical time
intervals, the overlapping area at the beginning is greater than the overlapping
area at the end of the interval. The eﬀects of the asymmetrical rotation are most
clearly visible at the tail of the curve. Similar to the uniform rotation (see the
second plot of Fig 5) the impact of the non-uniform rotation for the discharge
circuit is negligible.

Characteristics of Charging and Discharging an AC
Driven RC Circuit with Time-Dependent Capacitor

In this section we analyze the charging and the discharging characteristics of an
RC series circuit driven with an AC source. Schematically speaking, this implies
in Fig 4 we replace the DC power supply with an AC source. For this circuit,
Kirchhoﬀ’s law yields

In this equation f is the frequency of the signal and the voltage amplitude is
set to one volt.
Equation (1) is a non-trivial, non-linear diﬀerential equation. To solve the
eq(2), we apply NDSolve along with the corresponding initial condition. The
response of the circuit is compared to the equivalent circuit with a constant
capacitor.

Utilizing the Mathematica code, one may analyze the frequency sensitivity of
the circuit. As the result of one such analysis, we observe that the diﬀerences
between these characteristics are pronounced, provided the frequencies are set
to less than 1 hz.

Conclusions

As indicated in the Introduction, the authors have proposed a unique research
project that has brought together three diﬀerent subject areas: Geometry, Mechanics, and Electrical Network. Mathematica, with its ﬂexible and easy to use
intricacies, is chosen as the ideal tool to analyze the project and address the
”what-if” scenarios. As pointed out in the text, some of the derived results are
intuitively just. And for the hard to predict cases, we applied Mathematica to
analyze the problem and to form an opinion. As an open-ended question and research oriented project, one may attempt to modify the presented analysis along
with the accompanied codes to investigate the response of parallel RC circuits.
It would also be complimentary to our theoretical analysis to manufacture a
rotating capacitor to supplement the experimental data.
