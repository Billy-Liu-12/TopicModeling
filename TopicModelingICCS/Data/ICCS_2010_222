Abstract
In this paper, we derive a new asymptotic approximation of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. This formulation
follows the beam in a speed-of-light frame. It is fourth order accurate in the small characteristic velocity of the beam.
The formulation is simpler than standard particle-in-cell methods in the lab frame or in the beam frame. It promises
to be very powerful in its ability to get an accurate, but fast and easy to implement algorithm.

1. Introduction
Charged particle beams and plasma physics problems are extensively used in Science and Technology (see for
instance [1]). If we consider collisionless plasma or non-collisional beams, one of the most complete mathematical
models is the time-dependent Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations (cf. [2]). However, the numerical solution of such
a model, which is unavoidable in many situations, [3, 4] requires a large computational eﬀort. Therefore, whenever
possible, we have to take into account the particularities of the physical problem to derive asymptotic approximate
models leading to cheaper simulations (see [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).
In this work, we consider the case of high energy short beams. A typical example is the transport of a bunch
of highly relativistic charged particles in the interior of a perfectly conducting hollow tube. This is usually modeled
by the Vlasov equation, where the unknown f (X, V, t) represents the distribution function of particles in phase space
(X, V). It is generally coupled with the Poisson or Maxwell equations. Numerical simulations are mostly performed
using the particle-in-cell (PIC) method.
In this talk, we will derive a new asymptotic paraxial model as an approximation of the time-dependent VlasovMaxwell equations. Following [6], the model is derived by introducing a frame which moves along the optical axis at
the speed of light, so that the bunch of particles is evolving slowly in this frame. Then one considers a scaling of the

equations which reﬂects the characteristics of the high energy short beam. Finally, we introduce a small parameter
and we use asymptotic expansion techniques to obtain a new paraxial model which is accurate up to fourth order.
The simplicity of the so obtained formulation allows to use a ﬁnite-diﬀerence discretization for the Maxwell
equations. Hence, using a particle approximation for the Vlasov equation, a particle-in-cell technique can be easily
developed. This approach promises to be very powerful in its ability to get an accurate, but fast and easy to implement
algorithm.
2. The Vlasov Maxwell model
Let us consider a beam of charged particles with mass m and charge q which moves in a perfectly conducting
cylindrical tube. We deﬁne the axis of the tube as the z-axis. We denote by Ω the transverse section of the tube, by Γ
its boundary and by ν = (ν x , νy , 0) the unit exterior normal to the tube. We suppose that an external magnetic ﬁeld Be
conﬁnes the beam in a neighborhood of the z-axis which may be therefore chosen as the optical axis of the beam. We
denote by x=(x,y,z) the position of the particle, by p=(p x ,py ,pz ) its momentum and by v=(v x ,vy ,vz ) its velocity. We
assume that the beam is relativistic and noncollisional so that its distribution function f =f (x,p,t) in the phase space
(x,p) is a solution of the Vlasov equation

where p = γmv, γ = (1 −

Above F = q(E + v × B) denotes the electromagnetic force acting on the particles, whereas the electric ﬁeld E=E(x,t)
and the magnetic ﬁeld B=B(x,t) satisfy Maxwell’s equations

where the charge density ρ and the current density J are obtained from the distribution function f by

In the sequel, it will appear more convenient for the analysis to work in the position-velocity phase space (x,v).
Denoting again by f =f (x,v,t) the distribution function of the particles, we obtain that f is solution to the Vlasov
equation

where I denotes the unit tensor. From now on, assume that the beam is highly relativistic i.e., satisﬁes γ >> 1. Since
υz c for any particle in the beam, it is convenient to rewrite the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in the beam frame, i.e.,
in a frame which moves along z-axis with the light velocity c. Hence we set ζ = ct − z, υζ = c − υz and perform the
change of variables (x, y, z, v x , vy , vz , t) → (x, y, ζ, v x , vy , vζ , t). Next, following [9], [10], we introduce the notations:
x⊥ = (x, y), v⊥ = (v x , vy )

where ϕ = ϕ(x, y) is a scalar function and A⊥ = (A x , Ay ) a transverse vector ﬁeld. If we deﬁne A⊥ × ez by A⊥ × ez =
(Ay , −A x ), we observe that
div⊥ (A⊥ × ez ) = curl⊥ A⊥ , curl⊥ (A⊥ × ez ) = −div⊥ A⊥ , curl⊥ curl⊥ ϕ = −Δ⊥ ϕ.

Moreover, if we denote by τ = (−νy , ν x ) the unit tangent along Γ, we have the relation curl⊥ ϕ · τ = − ∂ϕ

Finally, the electromagnetic force becomes
F⊥ = q(E⊥ + (v⊥ × ez )Bz + vζ (B⊥ × ez )),

Fz = q(Ez + v⊥ · (B⊥ × ez )).

(17)

The treatment of the boundary conditions can be handled in the same way. We refer the reader to [9], [10] for details.
3. A scaling of the equations
At this point, we restrict ourselves to the case of a short beam. Then, one introduces a scaling of the above
equations, taking in account the three following properties of the beam:
(i.) the beam dimensions are small compared to the longitudinal length of the device ;
(ii.) the longitudinal velocities vz of the particles are close to the light velocity c ;
(iii.) the transverse velocities v⊥ of the particles are small compared to c.
Thus, we introduce two characteristic quantities:
l, the characteristic dimension of the beam,
v, the transverse characteristic velocity of the particles.

Now, we deﬁne a small parameter η with η = vc
1. Since the particle velocities are close to c, we have v2 =
2
v2⊥ + v2z = v2⊥ + c2 − 2cvζ + v2ζ c2 so that 2cvζ v2⊥ . Hence, vζ appears to be of the order vc and we choose w = η2 c
as a characteristic longitudinal velocity of the particles in the beam frame and consequently w = ηv. We deﬁne
l = ηl as a characteristic longitudinal dimension. Finally one takes T = vl as a characteristic time. We introduce the
dimensionless independent variables x⊥ , ζ , t , v⊥ , vζ deﬁned by
x = lx , y = ly , ζ = l ζ , t = T t , v x = vv x , vy = vvy , vζ = wvζ .

(18)

Remark 1. We have seen that it was ”natural” to deﬁne a longitudinal characteristic velocity w related to the transverse characteristic velocity v by w = ηv. In the same way, it is ”natural” to introduce a longitudinal characteristic
dimension l diﬀerent from the transverse characteristic dimension l, and satisfying the relation l = ηl
Next, choosing the scaling factors f , ρ, J, E, B, F as

ρ = q f υ2 ω,

J = ρc,
F = qE,

(19)

we look for the dependent variables f, E, B and F as functions of the following forms: f (x⊥ , ζ, v⊥ , vζ , t) = f f (x⊥ , ζ , v⊥ , vζ , t),
E(x⊥ , ζ, t) = EE (x⊥ , ζ , t ) , B(x⊥ , ζ, t) = BB (x⊥ , ζ , t ) , F(x⊥ , ζ, v⊥ , vζ , t) = FF (x⊥ , ζ , v⊥ , vζ , t). Note that ρ =
ρn , with n = f dv , v = (v⊥ , vζ ) and J⊥ = ηJj ⊥ , Jζ = η2 J j ζ .
We are able now to write again the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in the beam frame using these dimensionless variables.
Dropping the primes for simplicity, we get
Proposition 2. The Vlasov equation in dimensionless variables is

The electromagnetic force F is the same as in [9] or [10]

(27)

The boundary conditions can be handled in the same way.
4. An asymptotic expansion
Starting from the scaled Vlasov-Maxwell equations, we develop asymptotic expansions of f, n, j and E, B, E⊥ , F
in powers of the small parameter η:
f = f 0 + η f 1 + ..., n = n0 + ηn1 + ..., j = j0 + ηj1 + ...,
E = E0 + ηE1 + ..., B = B0 + ηB1 + ..., E = E0 + ηE1 + ..., F = F0 + ηF1 + ... .
The principle of the study consists in replacing formally in the Vlasov-Maxwell equations the functions by their
asymptotic expansions; then to identify the coeﬃcients of η0 , η1 . . .. Hence, it is proved that for determining the
asymptotic expansion f = f 0 + η f 1 + η2 f 2 + η3 f 3 of the distribution function f up to the order 3 in η, it is enough
to know the expansion F⊥ = F0⊥ + ηF1⊥ + η2 F2⊥ of the transverse electromagnetic force F⊥ up to the order 2 and the
expansion Fz0 + ηFz1 of the longitudinal electromagnetic force Fz up to the order 1 only. Then, using the expressions
(27) of the forces, we have
F0⊥ = E0⊥
Fz0 = Ez0

F1⊥ = E1⊥ + (v⊥ × ez )B0z
Fz1 = Ez1 + (v x B0y − vy B0x )

F2⊥ = E2⊥ + (v⊥ × ez )B1z + vζ (B0⊥ × ez )

(28)

Hence, it appears that we need only to know the expansion of E⊥ up to the order 2, the principal part B0⊥ of B⊥ , and
the expansions of Ez and Bz up to the order 1.
Next we turn to asymptotic expansions of Maxwell’s equations and their boundary conditions. We get the following

In order to construct the paraxial model, we need to distinguish the self consistent ﬁelds from the external ones, that
is
E = Ee + E s , B = Be + B s , and consequently E = Ee + E s

one easily obtains the same kind of results for self consistent ﬁelds.
5. The paraxial model

Using the results of the previous section, we now want to introduce a simpliﬁed paraxial model, which gives the
same asymptotic expansion of f up to the order three. It is derived in an heuristic way based on the above asymptotic
analysis. We will write this model in the beam frame coming back in the physical variables. First note that
E⊥s << E⊥s , c B⊥s

that is, the beam ﬁelds are largely greater than the ”electromagnetic force” when the beam is ultrarelativistic. Indeed,
2,s
2,s
E1,s
⊥ , E⊥ are equal to zero, whereas E⊥ is the ﬁrst non-vanishing pseudo ﬁeld. At the contrary, the electric and
0,s
0,s
magnetic ﬁelds E⊥ , B⊥ are diﬀerent from zero and depends on the charge density ρ (or n0 in dimensionless variables).
In these conditions, we have E⊥s − c B⊥s × ez 0. We deduce with (8) that
div⊥ E⊥s
curl⊥ E⊥s

We begin to derive the equations satisﬁed by

been determined.

As a conclusion, we have derived this model by only assuming that E⊥s << E⊥s and E⊥s << c B⊥s and we have

Theorem 10. The equations (32-35) determine the triple (E s , B s , E⊥s ) from (ρ, J) in a unique way.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, a new asymptotic approximate model for the Vlasov-Maxwell equations has been described. It has
been constructed from a paraxial approximation of the system of equations, and is adapted to highly relativistic beam.
The simplicity of the obtained formulation would allow us to use very simple numerical schemes (like ﬁnite-diﬀerence
discretization and particle-in-cell technique). This approach would be very powerful in its ability to get accurate, but
fast and easy to implement algorithm. A more complete study with numerical examples is actually in progress.
