Abstract. In this paper a strategy for integration of agents’ prepositional attitudes
is proposed in order to solve the semantic inconsistency between opinions of
members of agents’ population. In proposed algorithm all the agents’ answers are
transformed into fuzzy set equivalents and then final formula representing the
agreement of all opinions is obtained.

1 Introduction
Lack of central mechanisms of control in multiagent systems caused that the states of
some objects from external world might be for some agents not known. In such cases
the agents must be equipped with mechanisms that let them cope with incomplete
knowledge. In our approach this mechanism is called the algorithm of messages
generation [4],[5]. As an input of this algorithm the overall agent’s knowledge base is
given and as an output the prepositional attitudes (opinions) in which the content is
related to the current states of objects. The agents’ opinions are in the form of logic
formulas [4],[9]. Each formula is consisted of the modal operator and two indices to
the properties that are observed by the agent a∈A in the object oz∈O at the time point
tn∈T or are estimated on the basis of agent’s previous experiences applying the
algorithm for the messages generation. The co-existence of these properties in objects
from the set O is reflected by logic connectives such as: conjunction, exclusive
alternative or alternative. The language is given as: Ω={OPa(Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)),
OPa(Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz)), OPa(¬Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)), OPa(¬Pi(oz)∧ ¬Pj(oz)), Bela(Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz)),
Bela(Pi(oz)∨Pj(oz))}, where OP={Bel, Pos, Know}. If the states of the objects are
estimated on the basis of stored experiences then the modal operator of belief (Bel) or
possibility (Pos) is used otherwise - the modal operator of knowledge (Know). For
example for the formula Posa(Pi(oz)∧Pj(oz)) the spoken language interpretation is: In
my (agent’s a) opinion it is possible that the object oz has the property Pi and the
property Pj. Each modal operator has its numerical equivalent respectively: γKnow, γBel
and γPos that represents the level of agent’s confidence. Additionally with each
formula coefficient support αp is correlated (see section 3). If an agent at the
particular time point cannot perceive the current state of particular object from
external world and the results of the algorithm for the message generation are

unsatisfied it asks other agents about their opinions. The agents send the answers that
are the results of direct observation or applying the algorithm for messages
generation. Due to the natural inconsistencies between prepositional attitudes carried
out by different members of agents’ population the incoming language responses can
be different as regards to the used logic connectives in formulas and modal operators.
Therefore, the agent interested in integration all these opinions, needs to apply certain
strategies for semantic conflict resolution [5]. Proposed strategy is based on the idea
of language grounding that states that each language formula needs to be related to a
certain meaning embodied in private empirical experiences [1],[2],[3],[7].

2 A Strategy for the Integration of Conflicting Opinions
2.1 Basic Postulates
Postulates in relation to the states of objects:
1. If at the time point tk the object oz possesses both the property Pi and Pj then it
belongs to the class of objects O1(tk)⊆O.
2. If at the time point tk the object oz possesses the property Pi and doesn’t posses the
property Pj then it belongs to the class of objects O2(tk)⊆O.
3. If at the time point tk the object oz doesn’t posses the property Pi and possesses the
property Pj then it belongs to the class of objects O3(tk)⊆O.
4. If at the time point tk the object oz doesn’t posses neither the property Pi and Pj
then it belongs to the class of objects O4(tk)⊆O.
5. If at the time point tk the object oz possesses either the property Pi or Pj then it
belongs to the class of objects O5(tk)⊆O.
6. If at the time point tk the object oz possesses the property Pi or Pj then it belongs to
the class of objects O6(tk)⊆O.
Postulates in relation to the messages:
1. With each message a support coefficient αp, p∈{1,2,...,6} is associated.
2. If an agent sends a message with conjunction as a logic connective then the
support coefficient α1, 1=1,2,3,4 is equal 1. The state of an object oz is
unequivocally specified.
3. If an agent sends a message with exclusive alternative as a logic connective then
the support coefficient α5 is equal 0.5. The state of an object oz is not
unequivocally specified. Two states of affairs are considered: 1) an object oz
possesses the property Pi and doesn’t posses the property Pj either 2) object oz
doesn’t posses the property Pi and possesses the property Pj.
4. If an agent sends a message with alternative as a logic connective then the support
coefficient α6 is equal 0.3. The state of an object oz is not unequivocally specified
and three states of affairs are considered: 1) an object oz possesses the property Pi
and possesses the property Pj either 2) oz possesses the property Pi and doesn’t
posses the property Pj either 3) oz doesn’t posses the property Pi and possesses the
property Pj.

5. Each message ϕa about the state of an object oz can be transformed into its firstlevel fs1a(oz) and second-level fs2a(oz), a={1,2,…,card(A’)} semantically
equivalent fuzzy set representation. First-level fuzzy set representation fs1a(oz)
represents only the state of an object in relation to the co-existence of the
properties Pi and Pj in the object oz, but in the second-level representation fs2a(oz)
also the power of agent’s beliefs is taken into consideration.
6. If two first-level fuzzy set representations fs1a(oz) and fs1b(oz) consist a support
coefficient αl, l∈{1,2,3,4} then the support levels for the correlated formulas ϕa
and ϕb as a consensus opinion about the state of an object oz are mutually equal.
7. If there is a support coefficient αl, l∈{1,2,3,4} in the first-level fuzzy set
representation fs1a(oz) and α5 (or α6) in the first-level fuzzy set representation
fs1b(oz), then the support level for the formula ϕa as a consensus opinion about the
state of an object oz is higher than the one for the formula ϕb.
8. If there is a support coefficient α5 in the first-level fuzzy set representation fs1a(oz)
and α6 in the first-level fuzzy set representation fs1b(oz), then the support level for
the formula ϕa as a consensus opinion about the state of an object oz is higher than
the one for the formula ϕb.
2. 2 The Idea of the Algorithm for the Integration Prepositional Attitudes
Input: The set of answers ϒ={ϕ1, ϕ2,…, ϕcard(A’)} sent by the agents from A’⊆A.
Output: The opinion ϕC about the state of an object oz in relation to the properties Pi
and Pj with the confidence coefficient γC.
Parameters: γKnow=1, γBel=0.7, γPos=0.4, δ - the accepted value of tolerance in
relation to the support function’s value.
Step 1. Transform each formula ϕa into its first-level fuzzy set equivalent fs1a as
follows:
if ϕa=OPa(Pi(oz)∧ Pj(oz)) then fs1a(oz)={(k1,1),(k2,0),(k3,0),(k4,0)}γ
if ϕa=OPa(Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz)) then fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,1),(k3,0),(k4,0)}γ
if ϕa=OPa(¬Pi(oz)∧ Pj(oz)) then fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0),(k3,1),(k4,0)}γ
if ϕa=OPa(¬Pi(oz)∧¬Pj(oz)) then fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0),(k3,0),(k4,1)}γ
if ϕa=OPa(Pi(oz)∨ Pj(oz)) then fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0.5),(k3,0.5),(k4,0)}γ
if ϕa=OPa(Pi(oz)∨ Pj(oz)) then fs1a(oz)={(k1,0.3),(k2,0.3),(k3,0.3),(k4,0)}γ
where OP∈{Know, Bel, Pos), γ represents the level of agent’s confidence and is
correlated with modal operators as follows: if OP=Know then γ=γKnow=1, if OP=Bel
then γ=γBel=0.7, if OP=Know then γ=γPos=0.4
Step 2. Transform each first-level fuzzy set representation fs1a(oz) into second-level
fuzzy set representation fs2a(oz) as follows:
if fs1a(oz)={(k1,1),(k2,0),(k3,0),(k4,0)}γ then fs2a(oz)={(k1,f1(1, γ)),(k2,0),(k3,0),(k4,0)}
if fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,1),(k3,0),(k4,0)}γ then fs2a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,f2(1, γ)),(k3,0),(k4,0)}
if fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0),(k3,1),(k4,0)}γ then fs2a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0),(k3,f3(1,γ)),(k1,0)}
if fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0),(k3,0),(k4,1)}γ then fs2a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0), (k3,0),(k4,f4(1,γ))}
if fs1a(oz)={(k1,0),(k2,0.5),(k3,0.5),(k4,0)}γ then
fs2a={(k1,0),(k2,f5(0.5,γ)),(k3,f5(0.5,γ)),(k4,0)}

if fs1a(oz)={(k1,0.3),(k2,0.3),(k3,0.3),(k4,0)}γ then fs2a(oz)={(k1,f6(0.3,γ)),
(k2,f6(0.3,γ)), (k3,f6(0.3,γ)), (k4,0)}, where fp is the membership function of the object
oz∈O to the class of objects Op(tk), p∈{1,2,…,6} and is defined as:
fp: {1, 0.5, 0.3}×{1, 0.7, 0.4} → (0,1]
Remark: For each fs1a(oz) only one value δp of the membership function fp
p∈{1,2,…,6} is computed; fp(αp,γ )= αp·γ
Step 3. Compute fuzzy set representative fsr2(oz) of all second-level fuzzy set
representations fs2a(oz), a=1,2,..., card(A’):fsr2(oz)={(k1,Θ1), (k2,Θ2), (k3,Θ3), (k4,Θ4)},
Θ1 =

fs a (o z )∈ Fs 2 (o z )

)

Θ2 =

p ∈{1, 6 }

Θ3 =

card (A ' )

p ∈{2 ,5 ,6}

)

Θ4 =

card (A ' )

∑

(

f4 α p,γ
fs a2 (o z )∈ Fs 2 (o z )

)

Fs2(oz) is the set of all second-level fuzzy set representations.
Step 4. Apply the procedure of the choice of consensus description of the state of
object oz [see 5].
Stop.

3 Final Remarks
In this paper a strategy of integration of agents’ prepositional attitudes was proposed
in order to solve the semantic inconsistency between agents’ opinions. The receiver of
the messages applies the algorithm for the prepositional attitudes integration. In this
algorithm all the agents’ answers are transformed into fuzzy set equivalents and then
the formula representing the agreement of all opinions is obtained.
