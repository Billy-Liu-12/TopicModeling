Abstract. The article studies the short-term investment risk in currency market.
We present the econometric model for measuring the market risk using Value at
Risk (VaR) and conditional VaR (CVaR). Our main goals are to examine the
risk of hourly time intervals and propose to use seasonal decomposition for calculation of the corresponding VaR and CVaR values. The suggested method is
tested using empirical data with long position EUR/USD exchange hourly rate.

1 Introduction
Trading in the stock and currency markets has many common features, yet these markets have major differences as well. Currency market has higher volatility, which
causes higher risks of trade. There are many reasons which cause substantial volatility
of the currency market.
• The transactions, related to the pairs of currencies exchanged, have much more
trading partners, comparing to the stock trading.
• Currency exchange attracts much more instant, even unqualified traders, while
stocks’ trading requires at least basic minimal financial knowledge.
• The rearrangement of stock portfolio is related to quite big taxes, comparing to
relatively liberate tax policy in currency trading.
The traditional way of risk estimation in the stock markets is based on periodic risk
evaluations on daily basis or even by taking longer periods. This practice is in most
cases based on empirical experience and is convenient for application in trading
stocks. Yet even most simple analysis of currency markets indicates, that this kind of
risk evaluation could be not sufficient, as during the period of 24 hours it changes
several times: for particular hours it can differ even up to four times, as it is further
shown in this article.
The paper aims at the estimation of the market risk for the short-term investments
in currency market by suggesting the modified RiskMetrics model, based on risk
evaluation according to hourly profit alterations of the financial instrument.The second part of the article describes and evaluates the theoretical settings for risk analysis
in the currency markets by applying traditional models. The econometric description
and substantiation of the suggested model is presented in part 3. The fourth part presents experimental verification of the method using FOREX historical data of
EUR/USD hourly exchange rate fluctuations.

Short-Term Investment Risk Measurement Using VaR and CVaR

317

2 Theoretical Assumptions and Notations
One of the most widely used factors for market risk measurement is Value at Risk
(VaR), which is extensively discussed in scientific literature starting already from the
1990. Historically, the concept of the Value-at-Risk is related to the covariance calculation method that was first adopted by the J.P.Morgan Bank as a branch standard,
called RiskMetrics model [15]. The VaR measure means the biggest loss of investment R during the time interval, at the fixed rate of probability p of unfavorable
event:

P( R > VaR) ≤ p ,

(1)

where p in most cases is selected as 0.01 or 0.05 (or 1% or 5%). The loss of investment R is understood as negative difference of the buying price P0 and the selling
price P1 : R = −( P1 − P0 ) . In the article profitability is denoted as P1 − P0 .
The VaR measurement is very popular for its relative simplicity of interpretation,
as risk can be evaluated by single value- the loss rate at the occurrence of the unfavorable low-probability event. This brought the VaR measure acceptance almost as
standard value, recognized by many researchers. Together with these advantages, application of VaR has disadvantages as well. One of the main drawbacks is absence of
subadditivity feature: the sum of VaR measurements of two portfolios can be less,
than the risk of value change of the joint portfolio. VaR measurements are also limited
to estimating of the marginal loss and do not indicate to other occurrences of possible
loss. For eliminating this drawback, Artzner [1] suggested the alternative measurement for market risk evaluation, which meets the subadditivity requirement. They introduced the conditional VaR (CVaR), called the expected shortfall or the expected
tail loss, which indicates the most expected loss of investment, larger than indicated
by VaR, denoted by conditional expectation:

CVaR = E ( R | R ≥ VaR)

(2)

The estimation of both measures of risk evaluation is based on finding adequate
quantiles, according to the price distribution data of the analysed financial instrument.
The calculated values of VaR and CVaR are more precise, if we have more confident
information of the price distribution. Main methods of risk evaluation are based on
assumption of normality of return on investment distribution. But empirical research
does not confirm the normality of the real data distribution. The shape of profitability
distribution has fatter tails, differences in skewness and kurtosis. The fatter tails indicate more often occurrence of extreme unpredictable values, than predicted by the assumption of normality ([3,4,6-9]). The profitability distribution is taller and narrower,
than normal distribution. These empirical data indicate that by calculating VaR and
CVaR with the assumption of normal distributions, we underestimate real risk value.
There are several ways suggested in the research literature to reduce these deviations:
substituting normal distribution with the distribution with fatter tails or to use the
safety coefficient to compensate inadequacies. The theoretical background of calculating Var and CVaR risk measures on hourly basis are suggested in the next part.

3 Econometric Model for the VaR and CVaR Estimation
The presented model is based on the mathematical notation, as defined in the RiskMetrics Technical Document [15], and is applied for risk estimation for single type of
financial instrument. The input data for suggested model is collected on hourly basis,
by registering the opening and closing prices of financial-instrument. Let Pot be the
opening price of a given financial instrument at the starting point of hour t, and Pct the closing price for the same financial instrument at the end of hour t. Then the return
rt of one hour period is defined as:
rt = ln(

Pct
) = ln( Pct ) − ln( Pot )
Pot

The model could be defined as adequate, if it could estimate changes of values
over time and describe the distribution of return at any point of time. As stated in
[11,15], the standard RiskMetrics econometric model meets this requirement only for
the estimation of the investment risk for one-day returns analysis, and may give inadequate results while extending or shortening the time period. The market risk at an
intraday time horizon has been quantified by Giot P. in [5]. This paper suggests alternative model, where the analysis of returns, based on continuous periods of time, is
replaced by the discreet hourly-based return analysis. As the dynamics of the price of
a financial instrument is best revealed by the white noise process, the modified model
could be based on the following expression:

rt = μ + σ t ⋅ ε t

(3)

Here μ is average alteration of return during the given period of time; σ t - standard
deviation of return, and ε t are the independent random values, with the standard
normal distribution. Consequently, the return rt has conditional (time-dependent)
normal distribution, and the equation (3) can be modified to:

rt = ln(

Pct
) = μ + σ t ⋅εt
Pot

According to standard RiskMetrics model μ = 0 , equation (3) can be simplified to:

rt = σ t ⋅ ε t .
Return estimations, based on the RiskMetrics model, which assumes normal distribution, slightly differ from those, observed in reality: the tails are fatter, the peak
value of the return distribution is higher, and the distribution curve itself is narrower.
In most cases the inadequacies to return distribution are compensated by calculating safety factor or substituting the normal distribution by Student, Laplace, Weibul
or distribution mixes [2,11-14]. In the suggested model the risk evaluation will be
based on safety factor estimation from the experimental data.

By using definition (1) it is possible to calculate VaR as the return rt quantile.While

rt is normal distributed with mean μt and standard deviation σt , the value
r − μt
will have standard normal distribution. The value of the 5% quantile is
zt = t
σt
calculated as –1.645, and the 1% quantile is 2.326. Hence:

P( z t < −1.645) = P(rt < −1.645 ⋅ σ t ) = 0.05
P( z t < −2.326) = P(rt < −2.326 ⋅ σ t ) = 0.01
Thus, the 5% VaR makes VaR5%=-1.645 σt , and the 1% VaR makes VaR1%=2.326 σt . For the estimation of the VaR, σ t

2

must be found out.

σ t2 = E (rt − E (rt )) 2 = E (rt 2 − 2 ⋅ rt ⋅ E (rt ) + E (rt ) 2 =
= E (rt 2 ) − 2 ⋅ E (rt ) ⋅ E (rt ) + E (rt )2 = E (rt 2 ) − E (rt ) 2
According to Phillipe Jorion [10], the first summand of the equation exceeds the
impact of the second summand approximately for about 700 times. Therefore:

σ t2 = E (rt 2 ) .
As the standard RiskMetrics model offers, the σ t2 is calculated by employing the
method of exponential smoothing based on the past data:

where 0 < λ < 1 . The CVaR is estimated according to the definition (2). As the distribution of

rt is standard normal, for each reliability p we can apply:

CVaR p = E (rt | rt ≤ VaR p ) =

From the formula (4) we can calculate the values of CVaR5% = −2,063 ⋅ σ t , and

CVaR1% = −2,665 ⋅ σ t . In case the return distribution is normal, the evaluations of
VaR and CVaR differ only by value of constant: CVaR5% = 1,254 ⋅ VaR5% and

CVaR1% = 1,146 ⋅ VaR1% .

4 Experimental Verification of the Econometric Model
For the experimental verification of the suitability of the VaR model we will calculate 5% VaR and CVaR values for all 24 hours of the day. The long EUR/USD position data was taken from the FOREX (Foreign Exchange Market) currency market
reports. The EUR/USD hourly records (total of 6782 records) of opening, closing,
min and max prices have been collected during the period since 30 January 2003, 9
p.m. to 2 March 2004 9 p.m. After sorting data of selected time interval, 219 records were used for the calculation of the VaR values and the identification of the
accuracy of estimation.
The experiment was made in the following steps:
• Verification of the hourly return data fit, under the premise of normal distribution.
• Calculation of the volatility of the trading data, collected under hourly basis.
• VaR and CVaR estimation and analysis.
To verify the data normality, the cumulative function of the observed data distribution was plotted against the theoretical cumulative distribution. The diagrams of P-P
plots were slightly higher and narrower than the normal distribution and confirmed
the inadequacy of standard model to return distribution, as discussed in the part 2. The
calculation of hourly data volatility showed, that the trade risk increases, when the
data volatility is higher. The standard deviations and the data range (max minus min
value) of the observed data at the corresponding hours are shown in figure 1.

The experimental calculations pointed out, that the highest volatility of return occured between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., and the lowest between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. The biggest observed difference between the highest and the lowest volatility has reached up
to 400%. The difference in the volatility allows assuming, that the differences in trading risk could be similar. For calculating VaR using econometric model, presented in

the Part 2, the standard return deviation has to be estimated by using exponential
smoothing method. All calculations were made with the help of STATISTICA software, Time Series/Forecasting models. The obtained results are presented in Table 1,
where VaR5% and CVaR5% values are estimated for each hour of the day.

The given percent values only slightly exceeded the anticipated 5% level (the average makes 6.31). The conformity of the model was increased by calculating the safety
factor (its estimated value for the experimental data was 1.43), which was used to adjust the values of VaR and CVaR in order to fit the 5% level:

VaR5% = −1.43 ⋅ 1.645 ⋅ σ t

; CVaR5% = −1.43 ⋅ 2.063 ⋅ σ t

(5)

According to the estimated hourly values of VaR or CVaR, the suggested model
can help to set more flexible stop-loss rates. The current trading practice with the
fixed stop-loss value can lead to substantial loss, where high stop-loss value increases
risk to loose big part of investment, and too small value prevents from bigger gains.
The experimental verification of model let us to assume, that together with increasing risk volatility the stop-loss values have to be increased as well. The stop-loss level
was evaluated by spread (difference between sell and buy prices), presented in points
(1/10 000 change of base currency). By using formulas (5) and the data in Table 1 we
can calculate stop-loss boundary values in points. The VaR or CVaR values are multiplied by 10,000, the estimated safety factor 1,43.

In the Table 3 two levels of loss boundary values are presented: for more reserved
trading (VaR5% case) and for the player more tended to risk (CVaR5% case). It can be
stressed, that these coefficients are applied only for EUR/USD position in FOREX.

5 Conclusions
This paper suggests the modified RiskMetrics model of risk evaluation for the shortterm investments in currency market. The method is based on calculating VaR and
CVaR on hourly basis, using seasonal decomposition. The conformity of the model was
increased by calculating the safety factor, which was used to adjust the values of VaR
and CVaR. The experimental verification of model showed that together with increasing
risk volatility the stop-loss values have to be increased as well. The main results presented in the article provide basis for further research by applying the suggested econometric model for risk evaluation of short-time investment in the currency market.
