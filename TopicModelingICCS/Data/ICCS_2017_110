the shape of the skin so significantly that it may be reasonable to require an actual alteration
of the mesh to make the face more plausible when viewed from an angle.
This paper presents a method for the simulation of aging of a 3D model of an adult human
head for the use in creation of an identikit of a crime suspect. A 3D identikit can be created, e.g.,
using a deformation-based modeling method proposed by Martı́nek and Kolingerová [8]. The
proposed method uses an erosion-inspired approach for the aging simulation. Each vertex of
the mesh is assigned an erosion factor, which determines the magnitude of the face deformation.
The wrinkles are defined by a zero erosion factor, while the regions that should be enlarged
are assigned a positive factor. Other regions that should be preserved are also assigned erosion
factor of a zero value. In the case the mesh is not detailed enough for the required deformation,
a local subdivision of the mesh is applied in the eroded regions.
The main contributions of the proposed solution are:
• The method does not require any training data.
• The same aging parameters can be used for all models created from a base model using
a deformation-based modeling method.
• Subdivision is applied only in the affected regions, if the original mesh is not detailed
enough.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the state-of-the-art methods in the
field of face aging simulation. Section 3 describes the proposed solution and Section 4 presents
the results of the proposed algorithm. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

Related Work

Aging is a very complex process. Many methods exist that offer an approach for the simulation
of aging. While most of the methods work on 2D data (e.g., [11], [5], [9], [12]), being able to
simulate the aging on 3D models is vital for computer graphics applications, such as animation,
gaming or movie industry.
Aging of an adult is accompanied by the formation of wrinkles that deepen with age, by the
changes of appearance and characteristics of the skin and also by a subtle change of the shape
of the head.
Model-based methods represent the face as a point in n-dimensional space and the aging
process is captured as a curve in the given space. The methods usually require large training
data sets containing a series of scans for multiple persons at different ages, for which the
identity of the person and his of her age is known. A representative of this approach is a
method proposed by Scherbaum et al. [10]. They simulate the aging on 3D scans of children
faces. The approach requires that all the scans have the same number of points and a known
correspondence between the points of models of different ages.
Other group of methods concentrate on the simulation of biological processes causing the
aging of the skin. The methods ([3], [4]) simulate the optical characteristics of the skin by
modeling the individual layers of the skin and simulating the physical changes during aging. The
methods can produce a detailed and realistic results but are very computationally expensive.
Many methods focus their efforts on the creation of realistic wrinkles, as wrinkles are the
most obvious sign of the aging process. Boissieux et al. [2] proposed a physically-based method
for the creation of wrinkles. They represent the skin with a volumetric model and simulate the
wrinkles as a result of contracting muscles using the finite element method (FEM). Wang et

al. [13] use a 3D triangular mesh which is deformed in a user-defined direction. The shape of
the wrinkles is controlled by a governing curve on the surface. Li et al. [7] detect significant
landmarks on a photograph and a corresponding 3D model and use the information to align
the data. Then they project the wrinkles from the photo onto the model and deform the mesh
accordingly. Kim et al. [6] use a wrinkled example model. To enhance a new model with
wrinkles, they use user sketches and augment the wrinkles based on the statistics extracted
from the example model. The wrinkles are modeled as normal maps.
The existing methods mostly require a training data set, which can be hard to obtain,
especially in the case of simulation of aging of the 3D models.

Proposed Solution

The proposed method simulates aging by an erosion-inspired approach. The vertices of the
model are assigned an erosion factor that controls the deformation of the surface. A positive
value of the erosion factor is assigned to the regions that should be enlarged to mimic a deposition process, while a zero erosion factor suggests that the given region should be preserved.
Negative values of the erosion factor could be used to mark the regions that should be reduced,
such as very deep wrinkles. However, negative values are not used in the proposed solution as
they could cause an unrealistic appearance of the final model. After the values are assigned,
the aging is simulated by moving the mesh vertices in the normal direction to a distance defined
by the erosion factor.
The proposed solution is designed to simulate aging processes on 3D head models created using deformations, such as the approach proposed by Martı́nek and Kolingerová [8].
Deformation-based modeling uses a base input model and creates derived models by specifying
the deformations, without altering the number of vertices or the mesh connectivity. As the
mesh topology is the same for all the derived models, it is only necessary to define the erosion
values for the base model and the same aging deformation can be afterwards used for all the
derived meshes.
The proposed solution consists of the following steps:
1. Remeshing of the input mesh (optional)
2. Detection of the affected areas based on user-defined wrinkle endpoints
3. Local subdivision of the mesh
4. Computation of the erosion factor
5. Mesh deformation

3.1

Remeshing

The wrinkles on the face usually follow the direction of one of the principal curvatures. If
the initial triangulation of the base model does not follow the principal curvatures, it may be
reasonable to use an appropriate remeshing technique (e.g., a remeshing method proposed by
Alliez et al. [1]) to create a new base model that will yield better results in the aging simulation.

3.2

Detection of the Affected Regions

The affected regions are selected based on user-specified wrinkles. The user selects the endpoints
of each wrinkle that should be imprinted on the model. For longer curved wrinkles, it is
necessary to select also the vertices where the wrinkles substantially change direction. The user
also influences the size of the region affected by the wrinkle by specifying a wrinkle effect radius
r.
For each wrinkle, the remaining vertices that belong to the given wrinkle are detected
automatically. For each wrinkle segment, a plane p is created that passes through the endpoints
v1 and v2 and the average of the normals at the endpoints. To find the path between the vertices
v1 and v2 , the mesh is walked from the vertex v1 in the direction towards v2 . At each step of
the algorithm a vertex vi is added to the path such that it is a neighbor of the last vertex in
the path and is it the closest vertex to the plane p.

3.3

Local Subdivision of the Mesh

The base head model is usually not detailed enough for modeling of such fine features as the
wrinkles and so a local subdivision of the mesh is used to refine the mesh in the affected
regions. To select all the faces that belong to the affected region, the wrinkle paths detected
in the previous step are used. For each vertex in the wrinkle path, incident faces up to the
wrinkle effect radius (specified by the user) are selected. A set is constructed as a union of the
subsets belonging to each vertex; the set contains all the faces that can be affected by the aging
simulation.
For the selected faces, a simple subdivision scheme is used (see Figure 1). For each selected
face (dark faces in Figure 1a), three new vertices are created at the midpoints of its edges and
four new faces are created (as captured in Figure 1b). Afterwards, the faces that do not belong
to the affected regions but are neighbors of at least one of the affected faces have to be repaired,
to preserve the topology of the mesh. If a face neighbors with a single face from the selected
set, it is split into two (dotted lines in Figure 1c mark the face splits); if a face neighbors with
two faces from the selected set, it has to be divided into three new faces (see Figure 1d, dotted
lines mark the face split).

3.4

Erosion Factor

Erosion factor describes the magnitude of the deformation at a given vertex of the mesh. To
locate the deformation only to the regions specified by the user, a positive erosion factor is
assigned to all the vertices in the affected regions while the rest of the vertices is assigned a
zero erosion factor. For each vertex v in the wrinkle path, incident vertices up to the wrinkle
effect radius are selected and assigned a positive erosion factor fi by a Gaussian function

where r is the user-defined wrinkle radius. The same approach is used if the user also

weight gain or sagging skin.
The final erosion factor fvi is then obtained by defining the position of the wrinkles. For
each vertex vi within the affected area, i.e., each vertex that was assigned a positive erosion
factor in the previous step, the erosion factor fvi is calculated as

Results

In this section, the results of the proposed method are shown. A head model consisting of
10,925 vertices and 21,746 faces was used as the base model (see Figure 2). Figure 2a shows the
base model, Figure 2b shows the wireframe of the model and Figure 2c captures the wrinkle
control points that were defined by the user (red squares), as well as the wrinkle lines (blue
lines) detected automatically by the algorithm described in Section 3.2.
The base mesh is clearly not detailed enough in the affected regions, so it is necessary to
subdivide the mesh using the local subdivision approach as discussed in Section 3.3. The mesh
subdivision was applied twice to achieve better results. The first subdivision (Figure 3a) was
applied around the detected wrinkle lines with a radius r defined by the user. The second
subdivision (Figure 3b) was applied with a radius of r/3.
The erosion factor was calculated for each vertex of the mesh following the algorithm presented in Section 3.4. Each vertex was then moved in the direction of the normal to a distance
defined by the erosion factor, as discussed in Section 3.5. The results of the aging simulation
are shown in Figure 4.
As the deformation-based modeling does not change the mesh topology, the same erosion
factors can be used for any model obtained from the base model by a method, such as the
approach presented in [8]. The method [8] was used to create several models derived from the
base model captured in Figure 2. Figure 5 shows the result of the aging simulation when the
erosion factor calculated for the base model was applied to the derived models.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no other approaches that would be targeted at
aging simulation for models created by deformation-based modeling. The approach by Wang et

al. [13] is capable of deforming the model to imitate wrinkles, however, the results are not very
visually plausible (see Figure 6). A more recent approach by Kim et al. [6] uses sketch-based
modeling to simulate aging. Their approach can create plausible aged models (see Figure 7) but
the wrinkle sketches has to be drawn for each input model, unlike our approach that allows the
replication of the computed erosion factors for models derived from a base model. Furthermore,
the approach by Kim et al. [6] requires a wrinkled example model and simulates the wrinkles
using normal maps, while our approach actually deforms the mesh to achieve better results
when viewed from an angle.

Conclusion

In this paper, a method for the simulation of aging of 3D triangulated head models was proposed. The method uses user-defined wrinkle endpoints to detect wrinkle lines and imprints
the wrinkles onto the mesh using an erosion-inspired deformation approach. The method is
especially useful for deformation-based head modeling approaches, where new head models are

created by applying deformations to a base mesh. These deformations do not change the topology of the mesh and so the same erosion factors can be used for the definition of the wrinkles
as the ones that were used for the base model.
The proposed solution concentrates on the creation of distinct wrinkles that alter the shape
of the head when viewed from an angle. The solution could be enhanced by subtle wrinkles by
applying an appropriate texture.
As future work, we would like to reduce the necessary user interaction by detecting the
wrinkle endpoints automatically. The deformation-based modeling approaches, for which this
method is designed, usually work with a set of control points that define the head features.
These points could be used to estimate the wrinkle positions.
