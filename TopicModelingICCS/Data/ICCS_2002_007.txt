A b s t r a c t . The empirical conformational energy program f o r
peptides (ECEPP2) and molecular mechanics (MM2) have
been used for the simulation of the For-Gly-NH 2 backbone.
Two different methods for the calculation of the p o l a r i z a t i o n
energy term are proposed: the polarization procedure b y
non-interacting induced dipoles (NID), which assumes s c a l a r
isotropic point polarizabilities, and the polarization scheme
by interacting induced dipoles (ID), which calculates t e n s o r
effective anisotropic point polarizabilities. A comparative
study of ECEPP2 and MM2+polarization is presented. The
molecular mechanics results are discussed including t h e
total energy differences, partitional analyses of the t o t a l
s t e r i c energies and torsion dihedral angles. The global g ,
and the local a , b and d
minima are stabilized b y
intramolecular
H-bonds.
Although
ECEPP2-based
calculations rather under or overestimate the relative e n e r g y
of some local minima, the ID polarization energy t e r m
represents a significant correction to the total r e l a t i v e
energy.

Introduction

Several papers were reported on the topological description o f
the potential energy surfaces (PES) of diamides, and t h e i r
relevance to protein folding [1-7]. This paper deals w i t h
N - formylglycinamide (For-Gly-NH 2 ), which is taken as a m o d e l
for a single dipeptide. This molecule has been selected as a t e s t
for two reasons: (1) With the lack of a side chain, PES E(f , y ) is a
function of only two variables. (2) It has been established f r o m
first principles that the idealized 2D-Ramachandran PES for a
diamide must have nine minima, viz. a L , a D , b , g L , g D , d L , d D , e L a n d
e D . Since glycine (Gly) is achiral, instead of nine only f i v e
unique conformers can occur.

In previous papers, an induction term was implemented i n
the force field MM2 [8] for the study of dipeptide models. T h e
new field was applied it to the study of the c o n f o r m a t i o n a l
aspects of some asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions [9] a n d
dipeptide models [10,11]. A molecular mechanics method u s e d
frequently is the empirical conformational energy p r o g r a m
for peptides version 2 (ECEPP2) [12]. The force field d e s c r i b e s
the molecular steric energy as a sum of the e l e c t r o s t a t i c ,
non-bonded,
torsional, cystine torsional and l o o p - c l o s i n g
energy components. In order to obtain exact relative e n e r g y
differences between conformers, it is necessary to optimize t h e
geometry from appropriate starting dihedral angles to give t h e
gauche
and t r a n s
minima [13]. For this purpose t h e
optimization
algorithm
SIMPLEX MS-3 [14] has
been
implemented in the program ECEPP2. The dipole moment m h a s
been calculated from the point distribution of net c h a r g e s
taken
from
the ECEPP2 database.
In this paper,
the
implementation of the induction term in the force field ECEPP2
is described, and a comparative study of both force f i e l d s
applied to For-Gly-NH 2 is presented.

Computational Method

The appropriate treatment of non-additive many-body f o r c e s ,
in particular the inductive interactions in polar p o l a r i z a b l e
molecules, has been a long-standing problem in c o m p u t e r
simulations of molecular conformations [15]. The f a m i l i a r
effective pair-wise additive interaction potentials used in m o s t
molecular simulations were refined extensively, and s e v e r a l
internally consistent parameter sets are available [16-19]. T h i s
is not the case with model potentials that explicitly i n c l u d e
polarization. Consider a system of N polarizable point c h a r g e s

q i , a i , where q represent point charges and a scalar i s o t r o p i c

point polarizabilities in the absence of an external e l e c t r i c
i
field [20]. The local field at position i, E , introduces an i n d u c e d
i
dipole m in the direction of the local field,

m = ai × E

i

This local electric field is due to the electric field due to a l l
charges except q i and the electric field due to all i n d u c e d
i
dipoles except m . The local field is calculated only from t h e
charges at 1-4 atoms because the interest
here is t h e
correction of only the torsion component of the force f i e l d s

The explicit treatment of the induced dipole moments, as f a r
as they are generated
by the electric field due to t h e
permanent charges and dipoles of the molecule, has b e e n
suggested. Two different methods for the calculation of t h e
effect of the induced dipole moments on the p o l a r i z a t i o n
energy term have been proposed: the polarization p r o c e d u r e
by non-interacting induced dipoles (NID), and the p o l a r i z a t i o n
scheme by interacting induced dipoles (ID).
NID assumes scalar isotropic point polarizabilities. Since t h e
electric field at each position has to be evaluated to d e t e r m i n e
the induced dipoles, the polarization energy is most e a s i l y
evaluated from this field,

The most important aspect by which our treatment d i f f e r s
from earlier methods is that the local electric field from w h i c h
the induced dipole moments are evaluated does not depend o n

interaction of the induced dipole moments by means of t e n s o r
effective anisotropic point polarizabilities [21]. NID and ID
have been implemented in the programs ECEPP2 and MM2. A
database of atomic polarizabilities has been implemented in t h e
block data of both programs [22].
The molecule is considered as being made up of N a t o m s
(represented by i, j, k ,É), each of which acts as a point p a r t i c l e
located at the nucleus, and responds to an electric field only b y

Calculation Results and Discussion

The five minima of the conformational PES of For-Gly-NH 2
have been calculated with our version of the program ECEPP2,
which includes, besides the standard algorithm, ID and NID
polarization methods. The minima were described by Perczel e t
al. [1] at the ECEPP2 level, using the grid method for t h e
geometry optimizations [23]. The minima were also d e s c r i b e d

The

calculations, l y i n g
between the MM2+ID and ab i n i t i o
values. The e n e r g y
differences among minima are expected to be smaller f o r
For-Gly-NH 2 than for the remaining For-X-NH 2 amino a c i d
dipeptide models because Gly is the most flexible amino a c i d
[25].
The partitional analyses of the ECEPP2 total steric e n e r g i e s
for the five conformers
are reported
in Table 2. No
contribution of the torsional, nor cystine torsional nor l o o p closing energy components has been observed. The g l o b a l
minimum g is stabilized by the electrostatic energy term w i t h
respect to the remaining minima. The polarization e n e r g y
term is rather big when compared with the electrostatic a n d
non-bonded component parts and with the total steric e n e r g y .
The ECEPP2+NID polarization energy represents 20% and t h e
ECEPP2+ID induction energy represents
44% of the t o t a l
energy. For MM2, the MM2+NID polarization component is 9 %
and the MM2+ID polarization is 16% of the total energy.

energy terms in the force field. For both types of force fields,
the effect of polarization corrects the dipole moments in t h e
direction of the reference calculations, slightly i n c r e a s i n g
them for ECEPP2 and rather decreasing them for MM2.
The torsion dihedral angles for both families of force f i e l d s
are reported in Table 4. The effect of ECEPP2+polarization on f
and y is rather big. The effect on the remaining g e o m e t r i c
parameters
has a small individual
effect on the c h a i n
conformation because the amide bonds are known to be p l a n a r
around the s p 2 N atoms. Moreover, the s t r e t c h i n g and b e n d i n g
movements are more rigid than the dihedral angle c h a n g e s ,
and carry out shorter movements. However, the c o m b i n e d
effect on the overall conformation of the changes associated t o
the 33 conformational degrees of freedom corresponding t o
F o r - G l y - N H 2 is difficult to predict.
From the preceding discussion the following c o n c l u s i o n s
can be drawn.
1. The results of the present work clearly indicate that d u e
to the creation and annihilation of critical points, caused b y
excessive repulsive or excessive attractive interactions, it m a y
become necessary to recalibrate empirical force fields. I t
appears that the results of good-quality ab i n i t i o c a l c u l a t i o n s

might be suitable as primary standards for such a c a l i b r a t i o n .
At least in the present study for For-Gly-NH 2 , m o l e c u l a r
mechanics was able to predict, without and with the i n c l u s i o n
of the polarization energy term, the global minimum of t h e
conformational PES. It is also clear that, in order to see at l e a s t
a good portion of the total picture, the N - formylamides of a l l
naturally occurring L-amino acids must be studied by ab i n i t i o
methods as well as the amides of dipeptides, tripeptides a n d
tetrapeptides.
2. The comparison
of ECEPP2 and MM2+polarization
calculations for For-Gly-NH 2 shows that ECEPP2 gives a b e t t e r
description of the global conformational PES, while in MM2 t h e
inclusion of the polarization energy gives a better d e s c r i p t i o n
of the relative energy difference between both main minima.
3. The polarization energy term has not been r e v e a l e d
necessary
in
the
ECEPP2 geometry
optimization
for
For-Gly-NH 2 , but it influences the energy differences b e t w e e n
the conformers. In particular, this difference for only t h e
polarization component is 44% of the total energy d i f f e r e n c e ,
resulting of the same order of magnitude that the e n e r g y
differences reported in the ab i n i t i o reference c a l c u l a t i o n s .
An extension of the present study to alanine, serine and v a l i n e
analogues of For-Gly-NH 2 would give an insight into a p o s s i b l e
generality of this conclusion.
4. Further work is in progress dealing with the c a l c u l a t i o n
of the changes induced by polarization in the molecular a n d
atomic indices of the For-Gly-NH 2 conformers. The work w i l l
take advantage of the capabilities of the TOPO program w r i t t e n
for the simulation of the molecular shape [26].
