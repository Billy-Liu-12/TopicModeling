Abstract. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a dangerous health problem for the reason that the mechanism of hepatocyte infection is still
unknown. Hence, much attention has been put on the problem of interaction between HCV and human proteins. However, the research is still
standing at the beginning point due to the lack of structure information
of HCV and human proteins. We extracted the most representative set
of 18 complexes all known HCV protein complexes involving human proteins, and computed the binding propensity of each residue and sequence
entropy of each HCV protein. analyzed the most representative set of 18
complexes. Using a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), we
predicted binding sites with an overall sensitivity of 77%. The approach
will help understand the interaction between HCV and human proteins.
Keywords: hepatitis C virus, radial basis function neural networks,
binding site prediction, binding propensity, sequence entropy.

Introduction

Since the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1986, much attention has been
focused on the research of interactions between HCV and human proteins. However, identifying the patterns of interactions between these proteins is hindered
by a lack of structure information on these proteins. Hence, identiﬁcation of the
binding sites in HCV proteins, one of the most important median steps towards
the interaction between HCV and human complex, has been developed for the
purpose of understanding the HCV interaction mechanism [1].
However, the exact location of the binding sites within complexes, which can
not always be addressed with X-ray crystallography, NMR or other experimental
approaches, poses a problem. As an extension of our previous work [2], we have
developed a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model for predicting
the binding sites of HCV complexes. The RBFNN model is used to capture the
relations between HCV primary sequence features and the known binding sites.

To compute the numbers of binding sites, we considered the 2 longest chains in each protein
complex, for the reason that chains C and D of 1A1R, 1RTL, 1NS3, chain P of 1N64, and
chains B and D of 2A4R are very short sequences, and have limited inﬂuence on binding site
identiﬁcation.
This column gives the numbers of binding sites (identiﬁed by ASA method) in the 2 longest
chains of HCV complexes.

Conformational parameters such as sequence entropy, residue binding propensity,
evolutionary distance, secondary structure, as well as residue biological-physical
properties, are coupled as input feature vectors for the RBFNN model for locating binding residues. The model was trained and tested using a dataset of
HCV complexes with multiple chains, which were retrieved from the protein
data bank (PDB) [3]. Simulation results indicate that our proposed method can
successfully predict binding sites within HCV complexes.

Materials

We extracted 64 HCV complexes with known structures from PDB, and removed
the proteins with identity of 90% or higher using the program PSI-BLAST [4].
We then selected the protein complexes with multiple chains as the representative
set of HCV protein complexes. 18 structurally non-redundant HCV complexes
with multiple chains were left for our study of binding site prediction, as shown
in Table 1.
The accessible surface area (ASA) method [5] was adopted to compute binding residues within the HCV complexes. Speciﬁcally, in a given HCV protein
sequence, we calculated the ASA for each residue both in the unbound molecule

and in the complex using the program GETAREA 1.1 [6] with a probe sphere
of radius 1.4 ˚
A. An amino acid is deﬁned to be a binding residue if its ASA in
the complex is less than that in the monomer by at least 1 ˚
A2 [7]. In this way,
we computed the number of binding residues for each HCV complex (Table 2).

Methods

Due to the simple topological structure and powerful nonlinear mapping ability,
the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model has been successfully
adopted to solve nonlinear classiﬁcation problems with multi-parameters and
multi-models, including protein inter-residue contact map prediction [8, 2]. We
adopted the RBFNN model, described in our previous study [2], to address the
binding sites prediction problem.
3.1

Sequence Entropy

The importance of diﬀerent residue for maintaining structure stability and particular function of a protein can usually be inferred from the alignment of that
protein and its homologies. These information could provide some useful guidelines for analyzing and predicting HCV-human protein binding sites. In the
present study, we used the normalized sequence entropy score [11] to measure the
variability at a particular position of a given HCV protein sequence. Speciﬁcally,
this sequence entropy is deﬁned by the following equation:

where P (i) = nNi is the fractional frequency of type i residue in the jth column,
20
N =
i=1 (ni ) is the total occurrences of all residues in the column. A low
value of sequence entropy, Scolumn(j) , implies that position j has been subjected
to relatively higher evolutionary conservation than other positions in the same
alignment having a higher sequence entropy.
Considering HCV protein 1CSJ as an example, its 14 homologous sequences
(PDB ID: 2D3U, 2BRK, 1QUV, 1NHU, 2AWZ, 1OS5, 2I1R, 2HAI, 1GX5, 1GX6,
1C2P, 1NB4, 1YVE, and 1YUY) were retrieved from the PDB by using the program BLASTP [12]. Then, its sequence entropy was calculated from the alignment of these homologies by the help of Bioinformatics Toolbox of MATLAB
7.1, which is illustrated in Fig.1(a).
3.2

Binding Propensity

Several previous studies demonstrated that some critical amino acids, such as
structural or functional conserved residues, contribute signiﬁcantly to protein
binding segments, as well as to protein-protein interaction [13, 14, 15]. This suggests that some particular residues may have higher propensities than others in
protein-protein binding interactions, and these propensities can in some degree
be used to improve binding site prediction. The frequencies of residues in the
binding sites of HCV complexes can be used to derive the residue propensities.
The overall propensities of the 20 amino acids were computed based on the occurrences of each residue, as shown in Table 2. Brieﬂy, for a particular type
residue Ri , the binding propensity Pbind (Ri ) is deﬁned as:
Pbind (Ri ) =

Ri
where fbind
is the fraction of residue Ri in the binding sites, Obind (Ri ) is the
number of observed occurrence of residue Ri , N (Ri ) denotes the number of
ri residue in the whole HCV set. Residues with a higher propensity indicate
that the residue occurs more frequently in the binding surface in comparison
with other residues with lower propensity. Table 3 displays the detailed binding
propensities of 20 diﬀerent types of residue. For the purpose of encoding the
binding propensity to the input feature vector, we normalized all the computed
propensities. In this manner, all the 20 residues’ propensities lie in the area of
[0, 1]. Detailed distribution of residue binding propensity along the chain A of
HCV 1CSJ was demonstrated in Fig.1(b).

3.3

Encoding Scheme

Conformational features such as sequence entropy, binding propensity, residue
type, residue classiﬁcation, and secondary structure, were integrated to construct the input feature vector of our RBFNN model for each residue. Specifically, sequence entropy was represented by a 5-bit vector, i.e., 00001 denotes
the sequence entropy which value lies in the region of [0, 0.2), 00010 denotes
the sequence entropy in the range of [0.2, 0.4), · · · · · ·, 10000 denotes the region
of [0.8, 1]. Furthermore, binding propensity is also represented by a 5-bit vector, which is similar to that of sequence entropy. The detailed encoding scheme
of the other three conformational attributes, residue type, residue classiﬁcation
and secondary structure, can be found in our previous study [2]. Hence, a given
residue is represented by a 39-bit (5+5+20+6+3) vector. Moreover, when we attempt to determine whether a particular residue is in a binding site, the sliding
windows method [16,17] was adopted to construct an input feature vector of our
RBFNN predictor, to consider the contribution of sequence adjacent residues.

Results and Discussion

Here we take the HCV protein sequence, 1CSJ, as an example to illustrate the
result. The predicted scores of 531 amino acid residues along the chain A of
1CSJ are shown in Fig.2. The predicted scores of most residues lie in the area of
[-0.15, 0.15], and are labeled as non-binding sites. Roughly, the predicted binding
residues have scores in the range of [0.97, 1.05], and all the predicted binding
sites were located in the known 4 binding segments successfully. Fig.3 presents
the predicted and known binding sites for HCV 1NHU chain A and 2AX1 chain
A. The results indicate that our proposed method and RBFNN predictor can
catch the binding sites successfully.
To evaluate the performance of the RBFNN model, 3 randomly selected HCV
complexes, 1CSJ, 1NHU, and 2AX1, were selected as a test set. As shown in Table 4, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the model are 77% and 3%, respectively.
Moreover, our RBFNN model successfully predicted 94 binding sites out of the
127 binding sites from the 3 testing protein complexes, with an overall prediction
accuracy of 74%. Although the sensitivity is relatively high, the speciﬁcity remains to be improved. The residue properties, which were not used in this study,
such as positive charge, negative charge, polar, and hydrophobic, can be encoded

for more accurate prediction. However, prediction with accuracy 74% of binding
sites only with residue binding propensity and sequence entropy indicates this
method is very powerful and promising for narrowing down the search space.

Conclusion

We have developed a method for predicting binding sites in HCV complexes using
the statistical residue conformational property (binding propensity) and protein
evolutionary information (sequence entropy). Experimental results demonstrate
that the method can accurately predict binding residues in HCV complexes.
In our next work, we will focus on the problem of identifying interaction areas
between HCV and human proteins, and the results of this study will help identify
interaction segments between HCV and human proteins.
