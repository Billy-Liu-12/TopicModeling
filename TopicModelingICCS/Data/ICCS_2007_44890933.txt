Abstract. A synergetic model (DWT-LSSVM) is presented in this paper. First
of all, the raw data is decomposed into approximate coefficients and the detail
coefficients at different scales by discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). These
coefficients obtained by previous phase are then used for prediction
independently using least squares support vector machines (LSSVM). Finally,
these predicted coefficients are combined into a final prediction. The proposed
model is applied to oil price prediction. The simulation results show that the
synergetic model has greater generalization ability and higher accuracy.
Keywords: crude oil price, wavelet transform, least squares vector machines.

1 Introduction
The forecasting of crude oil price as attracted many academic researchers and
business practitioners, since the crude oil holds a strategic position in the international
market. However the nonstationarity, nonlinearity and too many uncertain factors of
crude oil price determination make its forecast an intractable task.
Traditional forecasting methods usually analyze the volatility of crude oil price
under the framework of demand and supply or use data-driven model to fit the oil
price series [1,2,3]. However, most of them failed to produce the consistently good
results due to the nonlinear mechanism and intrinsic complexity of oil market. In the
past the crude oil price was usually treated as a single series, the intrinsic complex
modes involved in the price series are mixed and can not be explored deep.
Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has outstanding scale separation ability. It
could capture useful information on various resolution levels [4,5]. In this paper,
DWT is used to decompose the original time series into separate components and
each component is forecasted independently with least squares support vector
machines (LSSVM) owing to its excellent forecasting performance [6,7]. Thus, a
synergetic model based on multi-scale decomposition is presented. To validate the
applicability of the proposed model, simulation experiments are conducted on crude
oil spot price.

2 Multi-scale Based Forecasting
The forecasting framework is as follows (see Fig.1):
1 Decomposing the original series by DWT
A discrete wavelet transform can be computed with a fast filter bank algorithm called
the `a âˆ’ trous algorithm. It is a non-decimated wavelet transform which produces
smoother approximations of the signal [8].

Fig. 1. The framework of prediction model

Given the time series of oil price {x (1), x (2),..., x (n)} , the scaling coefficients at different
scales can be obtained by the `a âˆ’ trous wavelet transform. Then the original series
could be expressed as the sum of the approximate coefficients c J and the detail
coefficients d j ( j = 1,2,...J ) :
J

x(t ) = c J + âˆ‘ d j

j =1

2 Predicting the decomposed coefficients independently by LS-SVM
Instead of predicting the original series directly, we predict each decomposed
coefficients by a separate LS-SVM:
cË†n (t + l ) = f (cn (t âˆ’ 1), cn (t âˆ’ 2),..., cn (t âˆ’ m))

(2)

dË† j (t + l ) = f j (d j (t âˆ’ 1), d j (t âˆ’ 2),..., d j (t âˆ’ n j ))

(3)

Here m and nj are referred as the embedding dimension. The l means l-th sample
ahead prediction. For each value of l we train a separate forecasting architecture.
3 Reconstructing the predicted value
Using LS-SVM predictor, the predicted values of the approximate part and detail parts can
be achieved. The reconstruction of predicted value can be expressed as:
n

xË† (t + l ) = cË†n (t + l ) + âˆ‘ dË† j (t + l )
j =1

3 Material and Forecasting Results
3.1 Crude Oil Price Data
The data material consists of weekly and monthly WTI spot price ($/bbl). The
original data material stems from the website of Energy Information Administration,
US Department of Energy. The weekly data was divided into two parts, training sets
(2004.01.02--2005.12.30) and testing sets (2006.01.06--2006.12.15). The monthly data
was treated similarly (training sets: 1999.01-2004.12, testing sets: 2005.01-2006.11).
To test the model, the forecasting procedure is repeatedly applied to the testing
samples. For every testing sample, we adopted moving window to intercept the
training samples.
3.2 Simulation
For the decomposition of the weekly data, db5 wavelet is selected as the wavelet
function and decomposition level is 4. The original series and the decomposed series
are shown in Fig.2 (a). The original time series is shown in the first subfigure,
following are approximate c4 and detail d j ( j = 1,2,...4) . The monthly data is dealt with
the same processing and the results are shown in Fig.2 (b).

By eq.(2,3,4), the prediction for 1,2,3 and 4-step ahead is obtained.
To estimate the prediction performance of the synergetic model, pure LS-SVM
model is used for comparison. Three criterions are used to evaluate the performance
of the prediction model: the mean absolute relative error (MARE), the normalized
mean square error (NMSE) and the direction statistics (Dstat1). The results show in
the table1. It can be obviously seen DWT-LS-SVM model outperforms the pure LSSVM model.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a synergetic prediction model (DWT-LSSVM) to predict the
crude oil price. The simulations show the method outperforms the pure LS-SVM
model. The decomposition methods separate complex series into several components
which include less and much similar dynamics features based on time scale. The
useful information on various scales would be easily captured. Therefore, wavelet
transform improve the time series forecasting accuracy, especially for oil price.
