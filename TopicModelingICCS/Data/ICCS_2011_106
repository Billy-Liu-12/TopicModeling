Abstract
This research proposes asset pricing models with inflation factor and also empirically examines performance of the portfolio
strategies using the model in the Japanese equity market for the deflationary period covering from 2001 to 2010. Our asset
pricing models are Inflation-CAPM and Inflation-FF3 incorporating the inflation factor in the famous CAPM or the Fama-French
3factor model (FF3), respectively. Empirical result for the Inflation-CAPM portfolio strategy reports that the performance
(opportunity of the portfolio strategy, accumulated return, rate of wining, average quarterly return and Sharpe ratio) of our
strategy is superior to the usual alpha stragegy (CAPM portfolio strategy).
Keywords: Capital Asset Pricing Model; Fama French 3 Factor Model; Inflation; Equity Portfolio Strategy

1. Introduction
Inflation is economic phenomenon such that price level rises and then the value of money decreases. In order to
hedge the inflation risk, we need to invest in the asset whose value increases in the inflationary era. Equity has long
been thought to be one of the assets. Due to the reason, we have lots of literatures discussing the relation between
the inflation rate and the equity return (Fama [3], Gultekin [4], Kaul [7] among others).
 Boudoukh and Richardson [6] reports that the equity investment could be inflation hedging for 5-year long term
horizon in the empirical study of the US equity market for the period covering from 1802 to 1990 and the UK equity
market for the period covering from 1820 to 1988. Kurisaki [10] decomposes the equity return into the periodic
return and the fundamental return and then empirically examines the relation in the Japanese equity market for the
period covering from 1981 to 2002. He reports the statistically significant correlation between the fundamental
return and the inflation. As the preceding researches suggest, the equity investment has long been thought to be one
of the effective inflation hedging strategies.
Since 2001, the consumer price index (CPI) in Japan has been almost flat or rather decreasing. In such a moderate
deflationary economy, people may not to hedge inflation anymore and then equity may lose the role of the inflation
hedging. In such an economic environment, our question is ‚ÄúIs the inflation factor not useful for equity portfolio
strategy any more?‚Äù

To answer the question is the purpose of our research. First, we propose our asset pricing models utilizing
inflation factor and empirically examines the explanatory power of the models. Second, we provide the way of
utilizing the models to the portfolio strategies and also discuss the performance of the strategies.
Our asset pricing models utilizing inflation factor are Inflation-CAPM and Inflation-FF3. The models incorporate
one-period lagged inflation factor as a forecasting indicator in famous Capital Asset Pricing Model (Markowitz
[5],Sharpe [9], Lintner [8]) or in Fama-French 3factor model (Fama and French [2]), respectively. The models could
be applied to the portfolio strategy when all of the parameters in the models are statistically significant.
Thus, we first empirically examine how much the explanatory powers of Inflation-CAPM or Inflation-FF3 are
improved from those of existing CAPM or Fama-French 3factor model, respectively and also examine the statistical
significance of parameters in the models. Second, we provide the way of utilizing the proposed models to the
portfolio strategies and also we empirically examine the performance of the Inflation-CAPM portfolio strategy in
the Japanese equity market for the period covering from 2001 to 2010.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In the next chapter, the data, the asset pricing models utilizing
inflation factor are provided and then the applicability of the models to the portfolio strategies is empirically
examined. In chapter 3, the way of utilizing the models to the portfolio strategies is provided and the performance of
the strategies is empirically examined. In the final chapter, summary and the concluding remarks are added.
2. Asset pricing models utilizing inflation factor and their applicability to the portfolio strategies
2.1. Overview of the Japanese equity market and inflation from 2001 to 2010
In advance to introducing our model, we take a look at the Japanese equity market and inflation in fig.1 that
provides TOPIX (Japanese equity market index) and CPI (Consumer price index) quarterly basis in the period
covering from Dec.2001 to Jun.2010.
Fig.1 tells us that TOPIX rose by roughly 1000 points from 800 in the period from March 2003 to June 2007,
while it fell to the previous level (800) after financial crisis. Regarding CPI, it was alost flat around 100 and rather
decreasing in the period. Thus, in the decade, it seems that equity is not the inflation hedging instrument any more in
the long term investment.
However, more closely looking at fig.1, not the magnitude, but the directions of TOPIX and CPI quarter by
quarter seem to be similar. Thus,the inflation factor should have potential to explain the short term equity return to
some extent and we propose the asset pricing models utilizing the inflation factor.

2.2. Data
In this research, we use quarterly data for Japanese financial market and inflation for the period covering from
December 2001 to June 2010. Regarding the portfolio strategy in Chapter3, we need first 40 quarter to estimate the

1718

Ken Sato et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1716‚Äì1725

parameters of the models in starting the portfolio strategy, Thus by necessity, we use the data before December 2001.
The data is categorized to (1) equity return, (2) inflation factor, (3) others.
1)
Regarding the equity return, we adopt 33 kinds of industry portfolio returns. Each industry portfolio return is
simple average of the returns of the individual equity returns belonging to the first section of the Tokyo stock
exchange and categorized to the industry.
2)
As the inflation factor in the computed using final figure of CPI (Total) in Tokyo 23 districts. As the inflation
factor for the computation of the forecasted equity return, we use preliminary estimate of CPI (Total) in Tokyo
23 districts due to the reason that the final figure is not announced at the time of starting the portfolio strategy.
3)
For the market factor and risk free rate, we adopt TOPIX and overnight call rate, respectively.
SMB factor and HML factor in the Fama-French 3factor model are both computed using the returns of the
individual equities listed in the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange. SMB factor is computed by
subtracting the market capitalization weighted average of returns of the bottom 50% market capitalization
equities from that of the top 50% market capitalization equities. HML factor is computed by subtracting the
market capitalization weighted average of returns of the equities belonging to the bottom 30% in the ratio of the
book to market value from that belonging to the top 30% in the ratio. We review the market capitalization and
the ratio of the book value to market value in every August.
2.3. The asset pricing models utilizing the inflation factor
We propose asset pricing models, Inflation-CAPM and Inflation-FF3, that incorporate inflation factor in famous
Capital Asset Pricing Model (Markowitz [5]„∏™Sharpe [9], Lintner [8]) or in Fama-French 3factor model (Fama and
French [2]), respectively.
CAPM (equation (1)) is the model that explains the equity return by the single market factor such as TOPIX.
Inflation-CAPM (equation (2)) incorporates the inflation factor (inflation rate) in CAPM.
The main feature of Inflation-CAPM is that only the inflation factor is one period delayed valuable. Due to the
feature, as we show in chapter3, the inflation factor plays a role of a forecasting indicator of the portfolio return in
the Inflation-CAPM portfolio strategy.

2.4. Empirical analyses on the applicability of the Inflation-CAPM to the portfolio strategy
We empirically compare the Inflation-CAPM to CAPM with respect to the explanatory power and the statistically
significant of the estimated inflation beta in the moderate deflationary period. When the explanatory power is high
and the estimated inflation beta is statistically significant, the Inflation-CAPM could be applied to the portfolio
strategy. Empirical results for CAPM and the Inflation-CAPM are summarized in Table 1.
From the results for CAPM, the explanatory power surpasses 50% in 25 industries out of 33 and the highest and
the lowest explanatory powers are 82.3% and 8.9%, respectively. Regarding the parameters of CAPM, the market
beta is 1% significant level in all of the industries except the Electric Power & Gas industry (5% significant level)
and thus the market factor is important. D in CAPM is 10% significant level in 12 industries and it suggests the
investment opportunity of the CAMP alpha portfolio strategy.
Comparing the results for the Inflation-CAPM with those for CAPM, we see that the explanatory power of the
Inflation-CAPM surpasses that of CAPM by 0.3%~4.5% in 18 industries and in these industries the equity return is
influenced by the inflation factor to some extent. Regarding the parameters of Inflation-CAPM, the market beta is
important as is the same as in CAPM and the inflation beta is 10% statistically significant in 9 industries out of 33.
Thus, it is suggested that the inflation factor could be utilized to the portfolio strategy in the deflationary period.

As is the similar fashion, we empirically examine how much Inflation-FF3 surpasses FF3 in the explanatory
power of the industry return and whether the estimated inflation beta is statistically significant or not.
The empirical results for FF3 and Inflation-FF3 are provided in Table2 and 3, respectively. The empirical result
of FF3 in Table2 tells us that the explanatory power of FF3 is above 50% (80%) in 30 (15) industries and the
explanatory power of FF3 is higher than that of CAPM. Regarding the parameters of the FF3, the market beta, the
SMB beta and the HML beta are 10% statistically significant in 32, 22 and 6 industries, respectively.

Comparing the explanatory power of the Inflation-FF3 in Table 3 with that of FF3 in Table 2, we see that the
explanatory power increases in 22 industries out of 33 due to the inflation factor. The estimated inflation beta is 10%
statistically significant in 14 industries out of 33. From the result that the inflation factor has some additional
explanatory power over the factors in the FF3, the importance of the inflation factor is recognized.

3. The portfolio strategies utilizing the inflation factor
3.1. Information of the time frame related to the inflation factor
In the portfolio strategy utilizing Inflation-CAPM (equation (2)), we forecast the excess return of the industry
time

i at

t ( R  Rt ) as E I t 1 using the inflation factor I t 1 at time t  1 (one period old information on the
i
t

f

i ,I

starting time of the portfolio strategy) and the inflation beta ( E

i, I

) estimated with the information up to time t  1 .

3.2. CAPM alpha strategy
The CAPM alpha strategy could be practiced when both CAPM alpha

Di

and market beta

are statistically significant. This strategy is effective under the assumption that the

E i,M in equation (1)
i
parameters D and

E i,M estimated with the information up to time t  1 is appropriate for the practicing the portfolio strategy period
from time t  1 to t .
Under the assumption, the parameter

Di

in equation (5) is interpreted as the expected return of the CAPM alpha

units of the market portfolio (TOPIX) with
strategy such that long one unit of the industry portfolio and short E
borrowing or lending the resulting net cash in the money market account.

The CAPM alpha strategy is effective when the return of the industry portfolio is not fully explained by the return

D i ) remains with the statistically significant level. When the CAPM
D i is positive ( D i ! 0 ), the expected positive CAPM D i is attained by the portfolio described above. In the case of
i
i
the negative CAPM D ( D  0 ), we could also expect positive return from the CAPM alpha strategy by just
of the market and the intercept (CAPM alpha

taking the opposite portfolio.
3.3. Inflation-CAPM strategy
The Inflation-CAPM strategy is the portfolio strategy driven by the forecast of the industry excess portfolio return
( Rti  Rt f ) with the inflation factor ( I t 1 ) after hedging the market risk. The Inflation-CAPM strategy could be
practiced and expected to generate the return E i , I I t 1 in addition to the Inflation-CAPM
beta ( E

i, M

) and the inflation beta ( E

i, I

Di

when both the market

) are statistically significant and the inflation factor ( I t 1 ) is not zero.

Under the conditions, the value D i  E i ,I I t 1 in equation (6) is interpreted as the expected return of the Inflationunits of the market portfolio
CAPM strategy such that long one unit of the industry portfolio and short E
(TOPIX) with borrowing or lending the resulting net cash in the money market account.

The Inflation-CAPM strategy is effective when the return of the industry portfolio is not fully explained by the
return of the market and the D i  E i ,I I t 1 remains with the statistically significant level. When the D i  E i ,I I t 1 is
positive ( D i  E i , I I t 1 ! 0 ), the positive expected return is attained by constructing the portfolio described above.

In the case of the negative D i  E i ,I I t 1 ( D i  E i , I I t 1  0 ), we could also expect the positive expected return
from the Inflation-CAPM strategy by just taking the opposite portfolio.
3.4. Inflation-FF3 strategy
The Inflation-FF3 strategy is the portfolio strategy driven by the forecast of the industry portfolio excess return
( Rti  Rt f ) with the inflation factor ( I t 1 ) after hedging not only the market risk, but also the SMB and the HML
risks. The Inflation-FF3 strategy could be practiced when at least for three industries all of the betas in Inflation-FF3
(equation (4)) (the market beta ( E
(E

i, HML

i, M

), the inflation beta ( E

i, I

), the SMB beta ( E

i, SMB

) and the HML beta

I t 1 ) is not zero. The Inflation-FF3 strategy is
B
C
practiced as follows. First, long one unit of the industry portfolio ‚ÄúA‚Äù and short w and w units of the industries
) are statistically significant and the inflation factor (

‚ÄúB‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù so as to make both the SMB risk and HML risk of the Inflatin-FF3 portfolio zero. Then, short

units of the market portfolio (TOPIX) to hedge the remaing market risk.
In more detail, when the excess returns of the industry portfolio ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù are modelled by Inflation-FF3

 In our expirical analysis related to the performance of the portfolio strategy, the Inflation-FF3 strategy is omitted
due to the very limited number of periods that the strategy could be practiced. In the practice of the Inflation-FF3
strategy, it would be better find the best combination of the industries to make the expected forecasted return
maximum.
3.5. The setting of the performance analysis
We evaluate the performance of the portfolio strategies for 35 quarterly periods by (1) number of periods that the
portfolio strategy could be practiced, (2) accumulated return, (3) rate of winning, (4) average quarterly return and (5)
Sharpe ratio. In each period, we estimate the parameters of the model using past 40 quarterly data in advance of
starting the portfolio strategy. Thus, the estimated parameters are used for only one period and updated in each
period. In the performance criteria (1), the CAPM portfolio strategy could be practiced only when both of the

Ken Sato et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1716‚Äì1725

parameters D and
i

E i,M

are statistically significant and the Inflation-CAPM portfolio strategy could be practiced

only when all of the betas ( E

i, M

,

E i, I ) are statistically significant and also the inflation factor ( I t 1 ) is not zero.

3.6. The performance analysis of the CAPM and the Inflation-CAPM portfolio strategies
 The results of the performance analyses of the CAPM strategy and the Inflation-CAPM strategy are summarized
in Table 4 and 5, respectivery.
First, in advance of discussing the each performance, we overview the explanatory powers of CAPM and
Inflation-CAPM. The explanatory power provided in Table 4 and 5 is not the one in Table 1 through 3, but the
average of the explanatory powers in the 35 periods for the performance analysis. The average explanatory power
across the 33 industries is 42.3% for the CAPM strategy, while it is 50.8% for the Inflation-CAPM strategy. This
result suggests that the Inflation-CAPM portfolio strategy incorporating the inflation factor is more effective than
the CAPM strategy.
Second, we discuss how frequently the portfolio strategy could be practiced, in other words, how many times we
have the opportunity to practice the portfolio strategy in the total 35 periods. Focusing on the number of industries
that have more than half of the periods (18 periods) to be practiced, the CAPM strategy has 5 industries, while the
Inflation-CAPM strategy has 25 industries. The average period to be practiced across the industries for the CAPM
strategy is 5.9 periods, while that for the Inflation-CAPM strategy is 21.6. These results suggest that the InflationCAPM strategy is superior to the CAPM strategy by the criteria (1).
Third, regarding the accumulated return, the average accumulated return (in annual basis) across the 33 industries
is 0.9% for the CAPM strategy, while it is 5.9% for the Inflation-CAPM strategy. Thus, the Inflation-CAPM
strategy is superior to the CAPM strategy by the criteria (2). In addition to the result of the comparison basis, the
performance of the Inflation-CAPM is also quite well in the absolute basis considering the fact that the performance
of TOPIX in the same periods is -2.4%.
We analyze the performance of the portfolio strategy based on the other three criteria only for the industries that
have more than half of the periods to be practiced.
Regarding the criterion (3), the rate of winning, the average rate of winning across the industries is 52.0% for the
CAPM strategy, while it is 61.0% for the Inflation-CAPM strategy. This result suggests that the Inflation-CAPM
strategy could generate the expected return much more steadily than the CAPM strategy.
The average across the industries of the average quarterly return (in annual basis) is 4.6% for the CAPM strategy,
while it is 10.5% for the Inflation-CAPM strategy. The performance of the Inflation-CAPM strategy on the criterion
(4) is more than doubled than that of the CAPM strategy. The results also suggest that the higher the explanatory
power, the higher the quarterly return. Regarding this criterion, we examine whether the average quarterly return for
each industry is deviated from zero with 10% statistical significance or not. The number of the industries that the
average quarterly return is deviated from zero with 10% statistical significance is only 2 for the CAPM strategy,
while it is 17 for the Inflation-CAPM strategy. Thus, the Inflation-CAPM strategy is superior to the CAPM strategy
on the short term return basis (criterion (4)). Finally, regarding the Sharpe ratio (criterion (5)), the results are quite
similar to those of the average quarterly return.

4. Summary and the concluding remarks
In this research, we provide the asset pricing model utilizing the inflation factor and the way of utilizing the
model to the portfolio strategy. Our models are the Inflation-CAPM and the Inflation-FF3 that incorporate the
inflation factor in CAPM and FF3, respectively.
The results of our empirical analyses report that the explanatory power of the Inflation-CAPM is superior to that
of CAPM and also the parameters of Inflation-CAPM are statistically significant in many industries. Thus, the
applicability of the proposed model to the portfolio strategy is suggested.
From the results of our empirical analyses related to the portfolio strategies, we see that the Inflation-CAPM
strategy is superior to the CAPM strategy in any of the five performance criteria in the deflationary period.
The performace analysis of the Inflation-FF3 portfolio strategy is omitted due to the very limited number of
periods that the strategy could be practiced. Thus, the analysis to examine the paformance of strategies remains to be
the future research.
