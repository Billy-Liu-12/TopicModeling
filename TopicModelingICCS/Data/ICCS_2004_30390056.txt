Abstract. Novel approach in the design of 2-D extremely narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlters is presented. The completely analytical design method
is based on the 1-D optimal bandstop FIR ﬁlters. The 1-D FIR optimal bandstop ﬁlters are based on Zolotarev polynomials. Closed form
formulas for the design of the ﬁlters are presented. One example demonstrates the design procedure. One application of the 2-D FIR ﬁlter with
extremely narrow stop bands is presented.

Introduction

Two-dimensional narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlters play important role in the image
and video enhancement/restoration tasks. They are frequently used in order
to remove a single frequency component from the spectrum of the signal. The
image ﬁltering can be accomplished by both the nonlinear [1], [4], [7], [8], [9],
[10] and linear [5], [12], [13], [14], [15] ﬁlters. In our paper we are concerned with
completely analytical design of 2-D bandstop FIR ﬁlters with extremely narrow
circularly symmetrical stop bands. The design of the 2-D narrow bandstop
FIR ﬁlters is based on the 1-D optimal narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlters [14].
We introduce the degree formula which relates the degree of the generating
polynomial, the length of the ﬁlter, the notch frequency, the width of the
stopbands and the attenuation in the passbands. Based on the expansion of the
generating polynomials into the Chebyshev polynomials, the recursive formula
for the direct computation of the impulse response coeﬃcients is presented. The
design procedure is recursive one and it does not require any FFT algorithm or
any iterative technique.

response h(m) of the length N as

1-D equiripple narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlter is based on the Zolotarev polynomial
Zp,q (w) which approximates constant value in equiripple Chebyshev sense in the
two disjoint intervals as shown in Fig. 1. The notation Zp,q (w) emphasizes that
p counts the number of zeros right from the maximum wm and q corresponds to
the number of zeros left from the maximum wm . Zolotarev derived the general

Analytical Design of 2-D Narrow Bandstop FIR Filter

The goal of the design of the 2-D narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlter is to obtain the 2D impulse response h(m, n) of the ﬁlter satisfying the speciﬁed notch frequency
ωm1 T , width of the bandstop ∆ω1 T , the attenuation in the passbands a1 [dB] in
the direction ω1 and the speciﬁed values ωm2 T , ∆ω2 T , a2 [dB] in the direction
ω2 . The design procedure is as follows :
1. For the speciﬁed values ωm1 T , ∆ω1 T and a1 [dB] (Fig. 1) in the direction ω1
design the 1-D FIR narrow bandpass ﬁlter. The design procedure consists of
the following steps :
a) Evaluate the Jacobi’s elliptic modulus κ

d) Using the degree equation (7) calculate and round up the minimum
degree n required to satisfy the ﬁlter speciﬁcation. For the algebraic
evaluation of the Jacobi’s Zeta function Z( np K(κ)| κ) and the elliptic
integral of the third kind Π(σm , np K(κ)| κ) in the degree equation (7)
use the algebraical procedure [14].

The brackets [ ] stand for the rounding operation.
f) For the integer values p, q and the elliptic modulus κ evaluate the coeﬃcients a(m) (9) of the Zolotarev polynomial Zp,q (w) using recursive
algorithm summarized in Tab. 1.
g) From the coeﬃcients a(m) calculate the M coeﬃcients of the impulse
response h1 (m) of the 1-D equiripple bandpass FIR ﬁlter using (10).
2. Repeat the ﬁrst step for the design of the 1-D FIR equiripple narrow bandpass ﬁlter in the direction ω2 speciﬁed by ωm2 T , ∆ω2 T and a2 [dB] resulting
in the impulse response h2 (n) of the length N coeﬃcients.

Example

Design the 2-D bandstop FIR ﬁlter speciﬁed in the direction ω1 by the notch frequency ωm1 T = 0.4 π, width of the passbands ∆ω1 T = 0.1 π for the attenuation
in the passbands a1 = −1 dB and in the direction ω2 by the values ωm2 T = 0.6 π,
∆ω2 T = 0.1 π for a2 = −1 dB.
Using our recursive design procedure we obtain the two 1-D equiripple narrow
band FIR ﬁlters with the impulse responses h1 (m), h2 (n) (step 1 and 2 in Sec. 3).
The impulse responses h1 (m), h2 (n) of the length M = N = 41 coeﬃcients are
summarized in Table 2. Their amplitude frequency responses are shown in Fig. 2.
The impulse responses h1 (m), h2 (n) are used for the design of the 2-D bandstop FIR ﬁlter (step 3, 4 and 5 in Sec. 3). The impulse response h(m, n) of the
2-D narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlter consists of 41 × 41 coeﬃcients. The amplitude
frequency response 20 log |H(ejω1 , ejω2 )| of the 2-D narrow bandstop FIR ﬁlter
with its contours is shown in Fig. 3.

Application of the 2-D Narrow Bandstop FIR Filter

The narrow 2-D bandstop FIR ﬁlters were successfully applied for the removal
of the unwanted frequency components in the spectrum of the image. Here
we present the enhancement of the rastered newspaper picture. The notch
frequencies ω1 = 0.32π, ω2 = 0.42π to be removed were obtained by the
evaluation of the spectrum of the input image. The impulse response h(m, n) of
the applied ﬁlter exhibits 37 × 37 coeﬃcients. The input and processed image
are shown in Fig. 4. The attenuation of the disturbing raster is apparent.
