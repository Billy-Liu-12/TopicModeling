Abstract. A new formulation for robust design of mechanical systems is presented using the concept of allowable load set. A new measure of safety of a
multi-body system is suggested. By maximizing this measure with respect to
design variables one can attain the most robust system. In this approach detailed
probability information is not required. Applications to multi-body systems
show new solutions to complex problems. As a specific category of problems,
trajectories of a human motion of lifting a weight with or without low back pain
are considered.

1 Introduction
Uncertainties in a structure have long been considered in the literature. Several methods have been studied to deal with uncertainties in structural design. Reliability based
design is one important direction and its methodologies are relatively well developed.
Detailed statistical data are required for reliability-based design, but they are not
readily available in most problems. For that reason, non-probability approach is studied as an alternative. Ben-Haim [1] suggested such a method using convex models.
The measure that he developed is the amount of uncertainty the system can tolerate
before failure. This measure is related to robustness with respect to uncertainty, and he
called it a robust reliability.
Among the uncertain factors, loading is the most dominant property and not controllable in many cases. Kwak and Kim [2] introduced a new concept called "Allowable Load Set," ALS in short, to deal mainly with the problems with loading uncertainty. ALS can be utilized for understanding characteristics of a structure and defining safety of a multi-body system by finding the weakest configuration. A new meas-

ure of safety, called a relative safety index, is suggested, which is defined as the
distance from a given nominal load to the boundary of ALS.
Robust optimal design maximizing a relative safety index of a system is presented.
The methodology is applied to the design of a multi-body system composed of several
subsystems. Because there may be several local minima in calculating the relative
safety index of multi-body systems, a global optimization method is utilized.

2 Definition of the Measure of Safety
The reliability based on the probability of failure has been used as the most popular
measure to represent the safety of a structure. However, in most problems there is no
reliable information on distributions of uncertain variables. To consider robustness of
the structure against a constraint with no probabilistic data, a new safety index is introduced in this paper, denoted by γ . It is simply defined as the smallest distance
from the mean value to the boundary of ALS in a load space. It can be obtained without knowledge of probability data of the random load. It is a relative measure useful to
compare each other. It is called here, a relative safety index. When it is used in optimal design, the result will lead to the most reliable design in a relative sense.

When the structure has n constraints, the corresponding relative safety index

γi

can

be calculated. The smallest index among them can be taken as a global measure of
safety of the structure. The structure is safer as this index is bigger.
Furthermore, the relative safety index can be extended to a multi-body system.
Since all constraints are dependent upon its configuration, the index is a function of
configurations, b , that is, γ = γ (b) in the multi-body system. Figure 1 shows that the

relative safety index between two configurations is different. Thus, the relative safety
index of the multi-body system can be defined as follows:

γ = min γ (b) = min min γ i (b).

The configuration b corresponding to γ is critical. It is quite possible that γ (b) has
multiple local minima and so a global optimization method may be necessary.

3 Robust Path Design of Multi-body Systems
3.1 Formulation
The proposed robust design is to maximize the relative safety index of a multi-body
system.

max bn+1 .
subject to bn+1 ≤ γ i , i = 1, 2, 3, ", N1 .
g N1 + j ≤ 0, j = 1, 2, 3,", N 2 .

where bn +1 and g N1 + j are an artificial design variable and geometric constraints,
respectively. In case the value of

γi

becomes large, the numerical optimization hardly

converges. To overcome numerical difficulties the above formulation can be transformed as follows:
(3)

max bn+1 .
subject to Gi ≤ 0, i = 1, 2, 3, ", N1 .
g N1 + j ≤ 0, j = 1, 2, 3,", N 2 .
where Gi can be determined by a global optimization method.

Gi = max max max g j (F, q k , b), j = 1, 2, 3, ", m.

In Formulation 1 load uncertainties are considered into the path design by Eq. (3).
Also the results are compared with those obtained by a conventional approach. Formulation 2 is a deterministic formulation that maximizes the minimum value of constraints, which is considered as a conventional approach.

subject to bn +1 ≥ g i , i = 1, 2, 3, ", N1 .
g N1 + j ≤ 0, j = 1, 2, 3,", N 2 .

3.2 A Biomechanical Model
A biomechanical model was developed consisting of body-segments namely; lower
leg (LL), upper leg (UL), trunk (T), upper arm (UA) and lower arm (LA). The spine is
the one of the most important part, because many people have been troubled by backache. So modeling of spine needs to be more careful. It has been reported that about
85% and 95% of all disc disorders occur at L5/S1 and L4/L5 levels, respectively [3].
In this model, the compressive load at L5/S1 is considered. To evaluate the constraint
functions, moments and inter-segment forces are calculated at the ankle, knee, hip,
shoulder and elbow.

Fig. 2. A biomechanical model

Hwang suggested a mechanical model to calculate the compressive load at L5/S1 for
lifting work [3]. The load at L5/S1 is calculated with the abdominal force, the erector
spine muscle force and the resultant force at the shoulder joint. Figure 2 shows the
biomechanical model used in this study. The spine is modeled with one beam element
instead of two beam elements as Hwang’s model. But the length of the beam changes
like a cylinder element. With the length of the beam, we can obtain equivalent spine
model with Hwang’s. The model has six independent variables: the angles of bodies
and the length of trunk.

3.3 Robust Path Design
Assuming that a man lifts a 20kg object from the ground to 1.2m high, two different
optimizations are performed. Formulation 1 maximizes the relative safety index to
reduce the effect of load uncertainties. It is a legitimate conjecture that the natural way
of force exertion by a human, although not yet well known, should be in such a way to
keep away as far as possible from the boundary of constraints, that is, hazardous conditions. Formulation 1 matches this principle.

It is difficult to construct loading constraints of human body due to its complexity
and non-linearity. Moreover, several constraints related to postures cannot be expressed by numerical equations without simplification. The constraints are defined as
shown in Table 1. There are nineteen constraint equations. Nine constraints are related
to ALS and the others are geometric constraints. Allowable loads are set to half of the
maximum loads a human can take.

Fig. 3. Optimal lifting posture (a) Formulation 1 (b) Formulation 2

The optimum paths are obtained by raising the hands from the ground to a height of
1.2m with an increment of 0.4m. The set of design variables, corresponding to the
worst postures is found by the global optimization method. Among several local solutions, the local solution that seems kinematically most natural is taken as the optimal
path. The two paths in Fig. 3 obtained by the two formulations show differences as
expected.

To investigate the results in detail, the ALS are drawn with a scale factor 4.e-4
when h* is equal to 0.0m and 0.4m (Fig. 4). The head of the load arrow denotes the
location of the mean load. Figure 4(b) reveals that the postures obtained by Formulation 2 are near the borders of constraints 5 and 9, which are related to shoulder and
spine. That is, the man with this posture is more liable to hurt than those by Formulation 1. Researchers in ergonomics recommend workers to take the postures shown in
Fig. 4(a). Considering instability and narrow safety margin that might occur when
lifting a heavy load, the postures that adopt Formulation 1 seem more natural and safer
than those by Formulation 2. It is thus our conclusion that one of the guiding principles suitable for predicting a human body motion is to use the relative safety index,
comparing with those previously used in the literature.

Fig. 4. The comparison of ALSes of optimal postures by two formulations (a) Formulation 1
(b) Formulation 2

Figure 5 shows the optimized postures of a man that has a backache. It is assumed
that he can endure only 2400N compressive force at L5/S1 instead of 3400N in the
normal condition. As against normal condition, the man with a backache tends to get
the trunk straighter and keep the object closer to his body. To investigate how the
variation of the spine load capacity affects other parts of human body, the rates of
change of relative safe indices and constraint value are calculated. Most parts are
affected, even though there are some variations by the postures, but the knee gets more
severe load regardless of postures.

4 Conclusions
A methodology using the concept of ALS is introduced and shown very effective in
path design of biomechanical systems. A new measure of safety of multi-body systems, which is called a relative safety index, is defined. To calculate this index does
not require any probability data, but it is a good indicator of structural integrity.

By maximizing the relative safety index, a robust design can be obtained. This criterion is adopted to obtain a new formulation of obtaining stable working postures and
results are compared with those by previously used force minimization approach. It is
also shown that how low back disorders affect working postures and human body
reactions. For the multi-body system a global optimization algorithm is usually necessary to locate several possible local minima.

In summary, it is shown that the concept of ALS is useful not only to show the
characteristics of the structural integrity of a biomechanical system, but also to do a
robust design without knowing detailed probability data.
