Abstract. We analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of the depth EEG recorded
from a patient with lateral temporal-lobe epilepsy. Statistical analysis based on
the Jensen-Shannon entropy (JS-E) as well as linear power spectral analyses
were performed. The spatio-temporal patterns from JS-E and β rhythm successfully detected the onset timing of the seizure and revealed the temporal topology
of the epileptic focus. The robustness of these patterns was proved by inter-trial
consistency. As the patterns are well matched with the clinical diagnosis, it could
be used for the identification of onset time and focus region of epileptic seizure.

1 Introduction
The epilepsy is characterized by a disturbance on the electrochemical activity of the
brain, producing an excessive and hypersynchronous activity of the neuron. Epileptic
seizures reflect this sudden and recurrent malfunction of the brain areas. Partial (focal) seizures originate from a restricted region and remain to this region (epileptic
focus), while generalized seizures involve almost the entire brain. Partial seizures
generally originate at a cortical area; most of them begin focally at the temporal lobes.
Exact localization of the epileptic focus and its delineation from functionally relevant areas are required for successful surgical treatment and understanding the basic
mechanism of the seizures. The primary tool for this purpose is the EEG due to high
temporal resolution and close relationship to physiological and pathological function
of the brain. Various spectral and nonlinear analyses of epileptic EEG have been used
to detect the epileptic focus and to predict the seizure onset [1~4]. Investigators have
extracted specific quantitative features from the EEG, which would be characteristics
for the discharge patterns during seizure [5].

We analyzed the spatio-temporal patterns of the epileptic EEG recorded intracranial for the temporal topology and source localization of seizure initiation and
propagation. Statistical analysis based on the Jensen-Shannon entropy (JS-E) and
linear power spectral analyses were performed [6].

2 Method
2.1 Intracranial Recording
Our data was from a patients presenting lateral temporal epilepsy clinically diagnosed
at Epilepsy Center in Medical collage of Seoul National University. Intracranial recording was required to confirm the exact site of the structures generating seizure
onsets before surgical operation. The EEG recording were performed on 30 sites as
depicted in Fig 1 and 2 (Telefactor Beehive telemonitoring system, sampling rate
200Hz, bandwidth filtering 0.1~70Hz). The data set analyzed in this study had duration of 3-5 min including 1 min before the seizure. The seizure onset was determined
by electrographic criteria as localized, sustained rhythmic discharges (burst of rhythmic spikes, low-voltage fast rhythms, etc.) and associated with subsequent clinical
seizure activity [7].

2.2 Jensen-Shannon Entropy
We applied the Jensen-Shannon entropy to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of the
EEG time series data. Jensen-Shannon entropy (JS-E) is a statistical measurement that
quantifies the difference between two (or more) probability distributions [8]. This
value would be maximized when two distributions reveal the most prominent difference in the statistical characteristics.
In case of epileptic EEG, we can find the abrupt changing points of the time series
data using JS-E. When total series S is divided to two subset, S1 and S2 of lengths l1
and l2, JS-E is calculated from the entropies of total time range (S) and two subsets
(S1 and S2) by equations below. With moving the dividing point by 1.5 sec, the distribution of JS-E was obtained. The EEG data in whole trial could be separated into sub
periods using JS-E peak points (see Fig 6).

For spectral analysis we considered the following frequency bands: theta (θ: 3 ~ 7Hz),
alpha (α: 8 ~ 13Hz) and beta (β: 20 ~ 30Hz). Fig. 3 displays the mean time course of
powers (averaged in 30 channels) of total and three frequency bands with window
size 10.24sec and 50% overlap. Fig. 4 displays temporal patterns of each band accumulated by sorted channels.

Near the onset time of seizure, β rhythm started to decrease for a short time (about 510 sec) and followed by an increase as the seizure evolved. Fig 5 shows the change of
power spectral topography of β rhythm over time. These activities are well matched to

In Fig 6, a whole trial EEG data were divided into sub periods using JS-E peak
points. Those sub periods fitted the evolving stage of seizure (inter-ictal / ictal / postictal) very well. We analyzed further the data for the early period for the source localization of seizure initiation and propagation, that is 80 sec-duration around seizure
onset. Fig 7(a) showed the distribution of JS-E across 30 channels over time, and Fig
7(b) depicted the peak entropy value on each recording site. It also matched well to
the seizure focus.
We tried to prove the robustness of these patterns using inter-trial consistency. As
shown in Fig 9, the JS-E peak entropy topography and β power topography at the
200% power- increasing point were consistent across the trials.

4 Discussion
The spatio-temporal analysis using the Jensen-Shannon entropy successfully detected
the onset timing of the seizure and revealed the topographic information of ongoing
seizure. Besides the localization of epileptic focus it could be extended to the temporal profiles of seizure propagation.
In the spectral analysis, β (20-30Hz) and θ rhythm (3-7Hz) showed spatio-temporal
patterns correlated with the ongoing seizure. α rhythm (8-13Hz) showed similar patterns even much more moderately compare to other bands. They showed decrease
near the onset time of seizure and followed by an increase as the seizure evolved.
Especially β rhythm started to decrease before the seizure onset and revealed spatiotemporal topography well matched to clinical diagnose of the epileptic focus and
temporal propagation of seizure.
The robustness of these patterns was proved by inter-trial consistency, that is the
spatio-temporal patterns from Jensen-Shannon entropy and β rhythm were consistent
across the trials. As the patterns are well matched with the clinical diagnosis, it could
be used for the identification of onset time and focus region of epileptic seizure.
