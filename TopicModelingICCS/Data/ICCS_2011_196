Abstract
The poly[pyridinium-1,4-diyl-iminocarbonyl-1,4-phenylene-methylene chloride] (1-Cl) is a novel oligomeric electrolyte gelator
with notable characteristics and multi-functionalities. In this study, we investigate its structural and dynamical properties by
means of the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The structural properties of 1-Cl in aqueous solution have been analyzed with
the help of the radial distribution functions for the coarse grained model of the polymer and the solvent. Diffusion coefficient and
the radius of gyration for the coarse grained polymer in solution have been calculated at various concentrations. We find that both
structural and dynamical quantities change significantly when the polymer concentration becomes sufficient to form the gel.
Keywords: dissipative particle dynamics; oligomeric electrolyte gelator; radial distribution function; mobility

1. Introduction
Polymer gels, especially hydrogels, are widely used in various fields, such as food, agriculture, biomedicine,
electronics, pharmaceutics, and chemical processing [1]. This has made designing and synthesizing new gelators a
very active research field in both academia and industry [2]. The properties of polymer gels are mainly depending
on the intermolecular interactions between polymers and organic/water solvents, such as hydrogen (H)-bonding, π-π
stacking, cation-π binding, van der Waals forces, charge transfer interactions, and electrostatic forces between the
molecules [3,4]. In the past decades, numerous organo- and hydro-gelators capable of immobilizing organic/water
fluids have been proposed based on these types of intermolecular interactions.
Recently, Yoshida et al. synthesized a novel oligomeric electrolyte gelator, poly[pyridinium-1,4-diyliminocarbonyl-1,4-phenylene-methylene chloride] (1-Cl) [2], in which a new oligomeric electrolyte is used as the
structural motif in the gelator, as show in Figure 1. The 1-Cl is a multifunctional gelator, which has several notable
characteristics [5], such as facile synthesis, resistance to acids, fast recovery of the mechanical strength after stress,
tunable solubility to apply to various solvents and ionic liquids, and synergetic use as dispersant for single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNT).

A few studies on the oligomeric electrolyte gelator 1-Cl have focused on the rheology, sol-gel transition, the
viscoelastic properties of 1-Cl with the addition of various salts using dynamic light scattering, the miscibility, and
gelation property of the oligomeric electrolytes for several organic solvents and ionic liquids [6,7,8,9]. However, the
gelation mechanism and dynamical properties have not been well understood so far. There is very little information
regarding the thermodynamic stability of gelator-solvent interactions, quantitatively described by the interaction free
energy. Because the gelatinizing processes happen at the mesoscopic length and timescale, i.e., greater than 1-1000
nm, ns, atomistic simulation methods are still computationally expensive. In this paper, we develop and simulate the
mesoscopic model of the oligomeric electrolyte gelator 1-Cl in aqueous solution, and investigate the structural and
dynamical properties of the system by means of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) techniques [10,11]. The DPD
simulation in this paper is performed with LAMMPS [12].
2. Modeling and simulation methodology
2.1. Mesoscopic model
In this work, the system to be simulated is composed of water and oligomeric electrolyte gelator 1-Cl. The gel
network formation process depends on many factors, including hydrogen-bonding, π-π stacking, van der Waals
forces, charge transfer interactions, and electrostatic forces among gelator molecules [3,4]. For the present ionic
gelator 1-Cl, it has been found that not only the cationic parts but also the benzamide moiety plays an important role
for the gelation [5]. Although the amide groups are typical hydrogen-bonding components, the direct hydrogen bond
between the amide groups of the ionic gelator 1-Cl would be very unlikely to form because of the significant charge
repulsion between cationic parts of the oligomeric polymer chain. Thus, it has been assumed that, instead of the
typical/direct hydrogen bond interaction between amide groups, the indirect hydrogen bonding via anions and
solvent could be effective for the self-assembly of the ionic gelators [5]. In other words, in 1-Cl gelator, the amideanion interaction between a relatively protic hydrogen of amide (N-H) and an anion Cl- plays key role for the gel
network formation, and the hydrated water molecules participate in the network to stabilize the gel. A possible
linkage between amide group, anion Cl-, and water molecules have been proposed [6], as shown in Figure 2.

To map the all-atom molecules to a mesoscopic DPD model, we need to define the coarse-grained beads.
According to the analysis mentioned above, we define two types of spherical beads: an oligomeric polymer bead Bp,

1033

Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2011) 000–000

and a water bead Bw. Each polymer bead includes one monomer of the oligomeric polymer chain and one chlorine
ion ( poly[pyridinium-1,4-diyl-iminocarbonyl-1,4-phenylene-methylene] and Cl- ). Since the average degree of
polymerization of 1-Cl is 13 [2], each coarse-grained oligomeric polymer chain 1-Cl has 13 polymer beads. To
construct a mesoscopic system, we need to determine the volume of the defined beads, and hence to determine the
length scale. We estimated that the volume of one monomer of the oligomeric electrolyte together with one chlorine
ion Cl- is about 240 Å3 using Moldraw [13,14], and the volume of a water molecule is about 30 Å3. According to the
DPD model, the water beads should be of the same volume as polymer beads. Therefore, the water beads Bw must
include 8 water molecules, so that their total volume is about 240 Å3. The radius of beads Rb is determined to be
about 3.9 Å, and the bond length Lb is taken to be equal to the distance between centers of mass of two neighboring
polymer segments, and has the value about 10.5 Å. In this work, we assume the simulated number density of beads
is ρRc3 = 40, a cubic cell Rc3 contains 40 beads, and therefore corresponds to a volume of 9600 Å3. Thus, the
physical size of the interaction radius of beads is calculated as Rc ≈ 21.25 Å.
2.2. Dissipative particle dynamics
The mesoscopic model described in the previous subsection is studied by means of DPD simulation techniques.
In the DPD method, to obtain the correct hydrodynamic behavior of the system, the total force Fi acting on a bead in
the system is the sum of pairwise-additive conservative force FijC , momentum conserving dissipative forces FijD , and
random forces FijR , where the sum runs over all neighboring beads within a certain distance Rc





Fi =  FijC + FijD + FijR rˆij ,
j i

(1)

where rˆij is a unit vector in the direction of rij, rˆij = rij / rij  .
The conservative force FijC comprises two contributions. The first contribution represents nonbonded interactions,

 

FijC = a ij ω rij rˆij ,

(2)

rij > Rc ,

(3)

where aij > 0 is the repulsive force parameter between bead i and bead j, aij also represents the maximum repulsion
strength between bead i and j, rij is the distance between beads i and j, ω(rij) is the weight function. The second
contribution takes into account bonded interactions and contains an elastic contribution Fs,ij, which describes the
harmonic force to tie two bonded beads in the oligomeric polymer chains, and a bond-bending force Fө between
consecutive bonds to control the polymer chain flexibility [15],

(5)

where Ks is the elastic constant, req is the equilibrium value of the distance between two bonded beads, Kθ is the
bending constant, and θeq is the equilibrium value of the angle between two consecutive bonds. Finally, the
dissipative force FijD and the random force FijR are defined as follows:



(6)

FijR = σω rij ξ ij Δt 1 / 2 rˆij .

(7)

FijD =  γω 2 rij v ij  rˆij rˆij ,

 

The dissipative force FijD depends on both the positions and relative velocities of the beads vij=vj - vi, and the
coefficient γ controls the strength of the dissipative force. Parameter σ determines the magnitude of the random pair
force FijR between the beads, ξij is a Gaussian distributed random variable with zero mean and variance 1, and Δt is
the integration time step. The dissipative force FijD and random force FijR act as heat sink and source, respectively, so
their combined effect is a thermostat. In order to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and make this particular
thermostat conserves the momentum, the following relationship is obeyed:
σ 2 = 2 k BTγ ,

(8)

where kB is the Boltzman constant and T is thermodynamic temperature.
2.3. Interaction parameters
To find the parameter a between the water beads, aww, we follow the method used by Groot [11,16], and match
the compressibility of the DPD water system with the experimental value of the real water system. The approximate
equation for DPD fluid is given by
p = ρk BT + α aρ 2 ,

(9)

where p is pressure, α = 0.101 ± 0.001, ρ is bead number density per cubic cell Rc3. By definition [11], the
isothermal dimensionless compressibility κ is given by

 1 =

(10)

where Nm is the molecule number per bead, and n = ρNm is the number density of actual molecules per cubic cell Rc3.
The two equations above provide the necessary relationship between the mesoscopic model parameters and the
compressibility of the system. Therefore, with κ-1 determined from experiment or atomic level simulation, the proper
value of the conservative force coefficient aww can be obtained from Eqs. (9) and (10). Because the beads of all the
components (water and polymer) have equal volume, this repulsion parameters should be taken the same for all
liquid components, i.e. aww = app. The repulsion parameter awp between water beads and polymer beads is
determined with the use of the Flory-Huggins theory [17]. In particular, the χ-parameter is used to express the
mutual solubility, so that the excess free energy of mixing ΔAm is expressed as
Am
k BT

= N A lnφ A  N B lnφ B + χM 0 φ A φ B ,

(11)

where NA is the number of water beads, and NB is the number of oligomeric polymer chains, φA and φB are volume
fractions of water and oligomeric polymer, respectively, φA + φB = 1, and M0 is the total number of beads in the
system. With the free energy of mixing ΔAm available, the chemical potential difference can be deduced as [17]

3. Results and discussion
In this work, the gelator-solvent system we simulated has size 150 Å × 150 Å × 150 Å. We have performed
simulations for different weight concentrations C from 0.75% to 5%. For concentration C = 5%, the system consists
of NB = 33 polymer chains and NA = 13952 water beads.
Figure 3 displays the radial distribution functions (RDFs) for the aqueous solution of the oligomeric polymer at
different concentrations. According to the results, after the gel formation the closest distance between two polymer
beads belonging to different chains is around 21 Å, Figure 3(a); and positions of the first and the second peaks in the
water - polymer bead RDF are around 7.25 Å and 14.5 Å, respectively, Figure 3(b). These indicate that, after the gel
formation, there are 2 water beads as a linkage between 2 polymer beads, which is in accord with the hypothesis that
there is no direct hydrogen bond between the amide groups of the ionic gelator [5], because of the significant charge
repulsion and steric repulsion between the monomers of the oligomeric polymer chains, and that the indirect
hydrogen bonding via the hydrated water molecules participates in the network to stabilize the gel.
From Figure 3(a), it can be found that for the system with polymer concentration C=5% there is one small peak at
the distance around 12.5 Å. This phenomenon may be caused by the fact that C=5% is almost the maximum gel
concentration and there is some precipitation of the gelator compound in the system, which also agrees with
experimental results by Yoshida et al. [9].

To study dynamical properties of the gelator-solvent system, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) ΔR2 of the
oligomeric polymers was calculated, as shown in Figure 4. The diffusion of 1-Cl gelator in the solvent has been
monitored for 100 ns. The calculation of MSD for each polymer chain is based on the displacement of the center-ofmass of the polymer chain from its initial position r0 to its current position ri, as expressed by Eq. (14)

4. Summary
In this paper, the mesoscopic model of the oligomeric electrolyte gelator 1-Cl and solvent has been developed
and simulated by DPD techniques. The total simulation methodologies have been described in some detail,
including the definition of coarse-grained beads and the preparation of parameters by using the Flory-Huggins
theory and RISM theory. The structural properties of the 1-Cl gelators have been studied based on the radial
distribution functions of 1-Cl gelator and solvent. The dynamical properties of the aqueous 1-Cl solution have been
also investigated. In particular, we have calculated the radius of gyration RG and the diffusion coefficient D0 of the
coarse-grained polymer of 1-Cl gelator in aqueous solution at various concentrations. The results indicate that the
polymer mobility significantly decreases at the gel forming concentrations. This can be used as an indicator of gel
network formation when study gelation ability of 1-Cl oligomeric polymer in other solutions or with other
counterions.
