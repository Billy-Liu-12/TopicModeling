Abstract. We have presented a principal component analysis
linear-weighted model (PCALWM) for credit scoring in [5,6], this article is
a further study on this model. We revised the application procedure in the credit
scoring, and tested it by a larger real-life credit card dataset. In comparison with
some well-known scores, the empirical results of the PCALWM can achieve a
favorable KS distance. The study on some application features of this model in
the credit decision-making shows that the model can help the credit issuers to
select the best trade-off among the enterprise stratagem, marketing and credit risk
management.
Keywords: Credit scoring, Classification, Principal component analysis.

1 Introduction
The growth in consumer credit outstanding over the last fifty years is truly spectacular
in the major countries, for example, in US, from the $9.8 billions in the year 1946 to
$20,386 in 2003[2] .Not all of this growth is due to the borrowing on credit lines, Credit
card (and debit cards) has become increasingly important as a method of money
transmission.
However, from the perspective of history, the increase of total outstanding of
consumer credit is always accompanying with more much consumers’ bankruptcy and
default, which are causing plenty of headaches for banks and other credit issuers. From
1980 to 2003, the number of individual bankruptcy filings in the US had increased by
560%[11]. How to predict bankruptcy and avoid huge charge-off loss becomes a
critical issue of credit issuers.
In the consumer credit assessment, credit scoring is widely used. Credit scoring
provides a suite of decision-support tools to aid the credit analyst. In credit scoring

system, the classification tools, which are derived from analyzing similar data for
previous customers, are used to categorize new applicants or existing customers as
good or bad. There are lots of classification tools available now, such as statistics
methods like discriminant analysis, regression, classification tree, nearest-neighbor
approach, nonstatistical method like linear programming, neural networks, genetic
algorithms, expert systems, etc [12,13].
The purpose of this paper is to further analyze the principle components analysis
linear-weighted model (PCALWM) which we had presented to assess the consumer
credit [5,6]. We will apply this model to a larger real-life credit card database to
evaluate its performance and study the characteristics in credit decision. This study will
make the model more applicable and help the credit issuers to make right decision.

2 The Basic Principals and Application Stages of PCALWM in
Credit Scoring
Principle components analysis (PCA) is a well-known, widely-used statistical
technique, and it is a purely data-driven way of exploring the data. The central idea is to
reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated
variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the data set.
The PCA approach uses all of the original variable to obtain a smaller set of new
variables (principal components--PCs)that they can used to approximate the original
variables. The greater the degree of the correlation between the original variables, the
fewer the number of new variables required. PCs are uncorrelated and ordered so that
the first few retain most of the variation present in the original set.
PCA approach was applied to the credit risk management cooperated with other
methods, Alici[1] used this method to predict the corporation bankruptcy with neural
networks. Recently PCA has attracted much attention in the risk analysis in larger scale
data and consumer credit data [3,8,14].
The PCALWM based credit scoring system includes 4 stages, data preparation,
training, testing, and predicting. The main stages show by figure 1.
2.1 Data Preparation
This stage consist of collecting relevant data, merging and cleaning the data, defining
the classes, selecting the variables, etc. we will get a dataset with suitable format which
is fit for the PCA computing after this stage.
2.2 Training Stage
We classify the data set into two parts, one for training to construct the predicting
model and the other for testing to validate the model. The different rate of the training
data in the total sample will impact the model’s efficiency, and a good classification of
the training data rate maybe get a good classification model.

The training stage is to achieve predicting model and set up the different credit
grade. Supposed we have selected principal factors, the scoring function of the
principal factors in the training sample could be expressed as:

F = a1 z1 + a 2 z 2 + ... + a s z s

zi is the i principal factor, a i is its contribution rate :

Zi = bi1 x1 + bi 2 x2 + ... + bin X n

Take the equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

F = c1 x1 + c 2 x 2 + ... + c n X n

( i = 1, 2 , ..., s ; j = 1, 2 , ..., n )

According to the score and the distribution of the bad credit in the training sample,
we can set up the different grade by a certain method and standard. Then one can
classify the different class based on the score. If the classification result is not ideal, we
will classify and compute the data again.
2.3 Testing Stage

This stage is to validate the model and the credit grade which get from the training
stage. We will choose the right score model and credit grade in this stage.
We use the same procedures in the training stage. But in data standardization here
we will take the average and standard deviation of the training sample, so we get the
data matrix

X i = ( x ∗i1 , x ∗i 2 ,..., x ∗ip )T

i = 1,2,..., m .

We use the equation 2.3 to compute the credit score in the testing sample, and
classify the credit grade with the set grade in training stage. Similarly, if the
classification result is not satisfied, we would classify the originate data and compute
again.
2.4 Predicting the New Applicants

In this stage, we use the score model to predict the new applicants credit score and
make the credit decision. After computing the new applicants credit score with the
certain procedure as in the testing stage, we compare it with the credit standard which
get from the training and testing stage. If the score reaches the threshold, we grant the
corresponding credit, otherwise reject.

3 Empirical Study
3.1 Data Set

We use real life credit card data from a major US bank to conduct the experiment. This
data set is composed by 5000 records, and two classes have been defined: good credit
and bad credit. 65 variables are selected for personal credit assessment. There are
including history payment, balance, transaction, account open, etc. we chose the SPSS
soft to perform all of the computations.
3.2 Computation Result and Analysis

In fact, the practitioners have tried a number of quantitative techniques to conduct the
credit card portfolio management. Some examples of known scores are (1) Behavior
Score developed by Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) [15]; (2) Credit Bureau Score also
developed by FICO [15]; (3) First Data Resource (FDR)’s Proprietary Bankruptcy
Score [4]; (4) Multiple-criteria Score [9,10] and (5) Dual-model Score [7]. These
methods can be generally regarded as two-group classification models, and use either
statistical methods or neural networks to compute the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
value that often used to measure how far apart the distribution functions of the scores of
the goods and bads are[13]. The resulting KS values from the learning process are
applied to the real-life credit data warehouse to predict the percentage of bankrupt
accounts in the future.
Formally, if nG ( s ) and nB ( s ) are the numbers of goods and bads with scores in a
sample of

n , where there are nG goods and nB bads, the pG ( s) = nG ( s) and
nG

nB ( s ) are the probabilities of a good and bad having a score s , then the KS
nB
distance is
(3.1)
KS = max pG ( s ) − pB ( s )
pB ( s ) =

s

We chose 2000 records as a training set as random to compute the score model, and
set three testing samples with 1000, 2000, 3000 records in the other 3000 records as
random. The KS distances show as the table 1, the biggest is 0.6222 and lowest is
0.524.

Among these scores, the PCALWM score is better than any other scores, except the
decision tree score, so the PCALWM can achieve a good KS distance, and have a good
classification.

4 Two Characteristics in Credit Decision-Making of PCALWM
In the practice, credit policy is the trade-off of the enterprise’s stratagem, marketing
and risk management. Loose credit policy is helpful to the market expanding, while
strict credit policy for the risk management. General speaking, the loose credit policy
will increase the type I error, and decrease the type II error to the credit issuers, while
the strict credit policy makes the opposite effect. So, if the model can give the
movement of the two type error with different credit granting rate efficiently, the model
will greatly help to the credit issuers to make the trade-off in the actual credit decision.
For the encouragement of the primary empirical result, we will further study the
application of PCALWM in the credit decision, mainly on:
!
!

The classification error with different training sample rate, that to say how the
training sample rate affects the classification accuracy.
the classification error under the different granting rate with certain training
sample rate. This will help the credit issuers to determine the granting rate
under certain risk level.

4.1 The Training Sample Rate to the Classification Error

We will study the different classifying training and testing sample how to affect the
classification error. In other words , under what training sample rate, the model can get
the better classification. We chose different training sample rate at random to construct
the predict model, and in the granting rate of 75%, compared the two type error and the
average error.
We chose five group training sample at random, including 500, 1000, 2000, 3000,
4000 records respectively, corresponding to the 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% of the total
sample, and the five testing sample are the corresponding rest records, which including
4500, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000 records. Table 3 shows the classification error of the five
testing samples.
The results showed that with the incensement of the training rate, type I error and
average error decreased, but the type II error no obviously change. The type I error

deceased rapidly, but the speed tends to slow. This results show that a bigger training
rate will help to PCALWM the get a better classification, especially to decrease the
type I error.
4.2 The Classification Error Under Different Granting Rate with a Certain

We chose seven granting rate groups with 80% training rate, figure 2 displays the error

Fig. 2. The classification errors of testing sample in different granting rate

The results shows that as the granting rate increases, type I error increases, while
type II error decreases sharply, and the bads’ rate in granted group increases slowly.
This shows the model has a good classification.
In practice, based on the tradeoff of marketing, enterprise stratagem and risk
management, the credit issuers can make the choice of the two type error and average
error to determine the best grant standard.

tested by a larger real-life credit card data, and some application features in the credit
decision-making. The empirical results and application characteristics of PCALWM
show the modle will help the credit issuers to make the best trade-off among the
enterprise stratagem, marketing and credit risk management.
Compared with some well-known credit scores, such as FICO behavior score, credit
bureau score, first data resources’ proprietary bankruptcy score and set enumeration
decision tree score, Multiple criteria linear programming score, our model has a
favorable classification.
Because of the great potential value in the consumer credit assessment, we will
continue to perfect this model, we hope to get better results through more logical data
processing and more suitable sample scale selecting, etc.
