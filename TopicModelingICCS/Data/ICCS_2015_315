Abstract
Pattern-based regionalization – spatial classiﬁcation of an image into sub-regions characterized
by relatively stationary patterns of pixel values – is of signiﬁcant interest for conservation,
planing, as well as for academic research. A technique called the complex object-based image
analysis (COBIA) is particularly well-suited for pattern-based regionalization of very large
spatial datasets. In COBIA image is subdivided into a regular grid of local blocks of pixels
(complex objects) at minimal computational cost. Further analysis is performed on those
blocks which represent local patterns of pixel-based variable. A variant of COBIA presented
here works on pixel-classiﬁed images, uses a histogram of co-occurrence pattern features as block
attribute, and utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure a distance between any two
local patterns. In this paper the COBIA concept is utilized for unsupervised regionalization
of land cover dataset (pixel-classiﬁed Landsat images) into landscape types – characteristic
patterns of diﬀerent land covers. This exploratory technique identiﬁes and delineates landscape
types using a combination of segmentation of a grid of local patterns with clustering of the
segments. A test site with 3.5 × 108 pixels is regionalized in just few minutes using a standard
desktop computer. Computational eﬃciency of presented approach allows for carrying out
regionalizations of various high resolution spatial datasets on continental or global scales.

Introduction

The complex object-based image analysis (COBIA) is a term coined by Vatsavai [1] for image
analysis using regular blocks of pixels as basic units of analysis. This diﬀers from other approaches to image analysis that use either individual pixels or image objects [2] as basic units.
Image objects are spatially irregular but homogeneous patches of an image obtained through
a segmentation process. Each object is characterized by a feature vector consisting of mean
pixel values, and, optionally, values of texture features and values describing object’s geometric

form. Image objects are basic units of an object-based image analysis (OBIA) [2, 3]; they are
subsequently classiﬁed or clustered to complete the analysis of an image. For big datasets the
high computational cost of image segmentation is a major shortcoming of OBIA. On the other
hand in COBIA an image is divided arbitrarily into a regular grid of local blocks of pixels
at minimal computational cost. There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between an image object –
spatially irregular region with homogeneous (simple) content that can be characterized by a
features vector – and a local block of pixels – a spatially regular region with heterogeneous
(complex) content that needs to be characterized by a descriptor more abstract than a feature
vector. Thus, whereas OBIA is performed in a coordinate space, COBIA needs to be performed
in a distance space where the only operation possible on data objects is the computation of
distance between them.
COBIA is particularly well-suited to perform pattern-based regionalization (spatial classiﬁcation) of large spatial datasets i.e. delineation of an image into regions characterized by
diﬀerent stationary (relatively small spatial gradient) patterns of pixel values. Examples include: classiﬁcation of very high resolution (VHR) images of urban areas into diﬀerent urban
landscapes, such as informal settlements, industrial/commercial structures, and formal residential settlements [4, 5]; classiﬁcation of diﬀerent landscape types [6, 7] as well as diﬀerent types
of forest structures [8]; identiﬁcation of physiographic units from digital elevation model (DEM)
[9].
Two practical implementation of the COBIA concept have been independently developed.
In [5] an image data (a set of all multi-dimensional attribute vectors from each pixel) in each
local block is modeled using a multivariate Gaussian distribution and a dissimilarity between
two blocks is calculated as the probabilistic distance between their modeled Gaussian distributions using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This implementation has been applied [5]
to supervised classiﬁcation of VHR images of cities into formal and informal neighborhoods.
Implementation of COBIA described in [10, 11] works on categorical datasets (a classiﬁcation of
image pixels into categorical classes is a preprocessing step). Data are modeled using a multidimensional histogram of categorical pattern primitive features and a dissimilarity between two
blocks is calculated using Jensen-Shannon divergence or other histogram dissimilarity measure
[12]. This implementation has been applied to search for similar landscape types in the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) [10] using query-by-example principle, to assessment land
cover change over the conterminous United States using the NLCD [13], and to identiﬁcation
of physiographic units using DEM data [9].
In this paper we describe how the COBIA concept, as implementation in our earlier
work[10, 11], can be utilized for unsupervised, pattern-based regionalization of large multispectral images into landscape types. The two-step process involves segmentation of the grid
of pattern-carrying blocks, and clustering of the resultant segments. Note that this protocol
is conceptually similar to the one employed by OBIA, but it involves performing segmentation
and clustering tasks in a distance space instead of a coordinate space. Also note that a grid to
be segmented is orders of magnitude smaller than an original image of the same region as each
block contains a large number of pixels. Thus, unlike in OBIA, the computational expense of
the segmentation task is not a concern when segmenting such grid.

COBIA – concepts and deﬁnitions

Fig. 1 illustrates the concept of COBIA using 2000×2000 pixels land cover map (a small fragment of the 30 m resolution NLCD 2011). Such map is a product of classiﬁcation of Landsat
images into 16 diﬀerent classes of land cover (see Fig. 1E for the full legend). Thus, in this case,

we don’t need to perform a preprocessing step of pixels classiﬁcation into categories because
classiﬁed images are already readily available and combined into one seamless product.
Landscape types are characteristic patterns of diﬀerent land covers, they can be visually
identiﬁed in the original image, but they stand out more clearly in the classiﬁed image. Landscape types depend on spatial scale which needs to be set a priori depending on investigative
interest. In this example an image is divided into a regular square grid of 200×200 pixel blocks
(shown in Fig. 1A) setting the pattern scale at 6 km. At that scale three diﬀerent landscape
types can be visually observed: (1) the cultivated crops matrix at the bottom of an image (see
Fig. 1B for a representative block), (2) the mosaic of deciduous forest and wetlands at the top
of an image (see Fig. 1D for a representative block), and (3) a transitional type between types
1 and 2 (see Fig. 1D for a representative block). However, consistent manual delineation of spatial extents of these landscape types is diﬃcult as the boundaries between them are not sharp
and each analyst would draw them diﬀerently. The problem becomes even more intractable
for larger and more complex images where a delineation algorithm is the only practical way to
proceed.
Unsupervised COBIA is well-suited to discover and delineate landscape types present in an
image. In our example the classiﬁed image is reduced to a small 10×10 grid of pattern-bearing
blocks. Thereafter we will refer to the block of pixels as a motifel – a smallest processing element
of the grid containing a local motif (pattern) of categorical classes. Each motifel has only a single
attribute – a histogram of pattern features, and the only allowable operation on histograms is
the computation of distance between them. Note that technically, histograms can be added,
but in many cases, depending on the selection of pattern features, the resultant histogram does
not correctly reﬂect a pattern in concatenated motifels. In this paper we use co-occurrence
pattern features [14]. A co-occurrence feature is a pair of classes assigned to two neighboring
cells. Features from within a portion of an image bounded by a motifel are extracted assuming
eight-connectivity and histogrammed. For an image with k possible classes, the co-occurrence
histogram has (k 2 + k)/2 bins, k of them correspond to same-class pairs, which measure the
composition of the classes in the motifel, and (k 2 − k)/2 bins correspond to diﬀerent-class pairs,
which measure the conﬁguration of the classes in the motifel. In application to NLCD there

are k=16 land cover classes and the co-occurrence histogram has 136 bins although for any
given motifel many bins are expected to have zero values as not all classes are present in all
motifels. We use the Jensen-Shannon divergence, JSD(A, B) to calculate a distance between
two histograms A and B. √
JSD(A, B) is always deﬁned, symmetric, bounded by 0 and 1, and
equal to 0 only if A = B; JSD has been proved [15] to be a metric.
Automated identiﬁcation and delineation of landscape types is achieved by unsupervised
regionalization of motifels in a grid. Technically, the process is similar to regionalization of
pixels in an image but it is performed on much smaller number of objects (104 times smaller in
our example) and in a distance space rather than a coordinate space.

Segmentation and clustering in distance space

It is a common practice (for example, [16, 17]) to regionalize images/grids by performing clustering of its smallest elements (pixels/motifels) in data space without regard to spatial contiguity
and to take spatial footprints of the clusters as sought-after geographical units. However, clustering individual motifels in data space does not guarantee spatial cohesion of the units – a
desirable outcome for any regionalization procedure. The only reason a non-spatial clustering may be an acceptable (but not optimal) approximation to regionalization is because many
spatial variables are highly autocorrelated so similarity in data space frequently infer spatial
proximity. However, a better approach to regionalization is to segment a grid [6]. A segmentation is the partition of a grid into a set of relatively homogeneous regions (segments) that
collectively cover the entire grid. Note that in the present context, homogeneity of the segment
refers to stationarity of the pattern within it.
There are several diﬀerent methods of segmentation that could be applied to regionalization.
Here we use a variant of non-hierarchical greedy region growing algorithm [18] that has been
additionally modiﬁed to work in a distance space. The algorithm assumes four-connectivity
between motifels and has a single free parameter JSDm – a threshold indicating the maximum
JSD between a motifel and the segment to which it can be merged. Given that we work in a
distance space, the distance between a single motifel and the segment is deﬁned as the distance
between a motifel and a medoid of the segment. A medoid is the motifel whose average value
of JSD to all other motifels in the segment is minimal.
The ﬁrst step is to select a set of seeds from which regions are grown. For each motifel
in the grid, the value of JSD to its least distant neighbor is calculated and stored as a local
dissimilarity score. Next, all motifels are sorted in the order from the lowest to the highest
dissimilarity score, forming a list of potential seeds. The ﬁrst segment starts as the ﬁrst seed on
the list and grows by absorbing neighboring motifels if the merging criterion is fulﬁlled. After
each merge, the medoid of the segment is recalculated. The ﬁrst segment grows until none
of its neighbors meets the merging criterion. All motifels in the segment are assigned labels
equal to 1 and are eliminated from the list of potential seeds. The subsequent segments start
as the highest rank remaining seed and absorbs previously unlabeled neighboring motifels until
none of its neighbors meets the merging criterion or until there is no unlabeled neighbors left.
All motifels contributing to the segment are labeled accordingly and eliminated from list of
potential seeds. The procedure ends when all motifels are labeled by their segment ID labels.
As our algorithm grows regions locally it is possible that two or more disjointed segments
contain identical or highly similar patterns. Therefore, grid segmentation cannot be the ﬁnal
step toward grid regionalization but needs to be followed by clustering of segments into ﬁnal
landscape units of unique patterns. In this paper we use hierarchical clustering with Ward’s
linkage to achieve this ﬁnal step. Hierarchical algorithm has an advantage over say a k-medoids

algorithm inasmuch as it allows to analyze progressively more generalized landscape types.
Thus, our entire procedure has two free parameters that control the level of generalization of
the landscape. First, by decreasing the value of JSDm we make the merging criterion more lax
resulting in smaller number of less homogeneous (more generalized) segments. Second, decreasing the number of segments clusters we keep results in a smaller number of more generalized
landscape units. Although the “best” values of these parameters can be in principle determined
by using a silhouette method [19], in practice we have found that best results are obtained empirically. As the procedure is fast, empirical approach does not lead to a heavy computational
burden.

Results

Our test site (Fig. 2) is the 17, 500 × 20, 000 pixels (525 km × 600 km) fragment of NLCD 2011
covering large portions of the U.S. states of Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The site includes
an example image shown in Fig. 1 but it extends far beyond it. Legend in Fig. 1 pertains also
to Fig. 2. In general, brown and yellow colors indicate agricultural regions, green and light
blue colors indicate forest, blue color indicates water, and red colors indicate urban areas. An
analyst can recognize existence of diﬀerent landscape type patterns but would have diﬃculty
to delineate them because of lack of sharp boundaries (except for the lakes). Unsupervised
COBIA can identify and delineate landscape types in this site objectively and automatically.
We have selected motifels to have the size of 100×100 pixels thus we consider patterns of land
cover classes on the scale of 3 km. The resulting grid has dimensions of 171×200. We performed
segmentation with the value of the threshold JSDm = 0.7 resulting in 7117 segments. Many

of those segments are just single motifel segments – an artifact of the greedy region growing
algorithm. The distance matrix between all 7117 segments (each represented by its medoid) is
calculated followed by a hierarchical clustering of segments. The result of hierarchical clustering
can be visualized by a dendrogram (Fig. 4D). The dendrogram has been cut at the level that
corresponds to N = 9 clusters (the largest number of landscape types we are considering). The
nine landscape types can be further merged according to the dendrogram; we produce maps of
landscape types with N = 9, N = 7, and N = 5 progressively more generalized pattern types.
Fig. 3 shows the boundaries between landscape types for the N = 7 superimposed on the land
cover map to show a degree of pattern stationarity in every landscape type. The insert shows
a map of seven landscape types (see Fig. 4E for a legend).
Visual inspection of Fig. 3 indicates that our algorithm has succeeded in identifying and
delineationg major landscape type. Like any other unsupervised learning analysis ours is an
exploratory approach and the resulting map depends on our assumptions regarding a scale
of the pattern, the number of landscape types, and, to a lesser degree on features used to
construct a histogram representing a motifel and on a selection of a distance function. Fig. 4 A,
B, and C shows the maps of landscape types with nine, seven, and ﬁve landscape types present.
Fig. 4E shows a legend to the map with the nine landscape types. The legend also shows a
medoid of each type to illustrate its characteristic land cover pattern. A dendrogram (Fig. 4D)
illustrates how landscape type merge if less then nine clusters are chosen. Thus, selecting only
seven clusters will merge mostly crops and crops/urban mosaic into a single landscape type and
forest/pasture/wetland mosaic with wetland/forest/water mosaic into another single landscape

type. Selecting only ﬁve clusters leads to further merging of landscape types as indicated by
the dendrogram. One possible surprise is that selecting only four clusters will result in merging
of water and urban mosaic types, but many motifels containing mostly water have also some
urban component (settlements tend to be build near water) which explains that merge. If we
decide to have only two landscape types (top of the dendrogram) it would be a forest and
everything else.
Table 1 contains information about the three levels of clustering. For each cluster the table
lists the number of motifels in it and a cluster deviation, δ, calculated as an average distance of
all motifels in a cluster to its medoid. Cluster deviation measures level of diversity between local
landscapes in a given landscape type LT. The arrows in Table 1 indicate merging of clusters. An
average cluster deviation is 0.38, 0.39, and 0.39 for nine, seven, and ﬁve clusterings, respectively.
This compares to an average distance between cluster medoids of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.76 for those
clusterings, respectively. Thus, as the number of clusters decreases (generalization of landscape
type increases) the ratio of average cluster diversity to average inter-cluster distance remains
approximately constant for these three clusterings.

Computer software and performance

All calculations except the hierarchical clustering have been performed using the Geospatial
Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT), a collection of modules for carrying out COBIA on images
and other spatial datasets. GeoPAT modules are written in ANSI C and are designed to
work within the GRASS GIS 7 [20] environment under Linux operating system. The GeoPAT
toolbox is available for download from http://sil.uc.edu/. GeoPAT consists of modules for
extraction of a grid containing histograms of motifels as well as modules for geoprocessing tasks
on motifels, such as, for example, a segmentation or calcuation of distance matrix between
motifels or segments of motifels. It also contains library of functions for calculating pattern
features (including the co-occurrence features) and for calculating a distance between motifels
(including the Jensen-Shannon divergence).
Calculations for the test site were performed using a standard desktop computer with 16GB
memory and a single Intel Core i7 2.86GHz processor having four cores (8 threads). Calculating
a 171 × 200 grid of motifels (each having as an attribute a histogram of co-occurrence features)

from the 17, 500×20, 000 pixels image took 38.3 sec. Segmentation of the grid into 7117 segments
took 93 sec, and calcuating a 7117 × 7117 distance matrix between segments (necessary for the
hierarchical clustering) took 83 sec. Modules for calculating the grid and the distance matrix
are parallelized and take advantage of all threads, but segmentation module uses only a single
thread. Actual hierarchical clustering is calculated by R package in a negligible time as it
uses the distance matrix already calculated in GeoPAT. All times include input and output
operations.

Conclusions and Discussion

We have developed a computationally eﬃcient method for pattern-based regionalization of large
pixel-classiﬁed images. The eﬃciency of the method stems from using motifels – local square
blocks of categorical data – as elementary units of analysis. Conversion of large image into small
grid of motifels is achieved at small computational cost and segmentation of the grid yields the
sought-after regionalization. The price for reduction of spatial size is the internal complexity
of motifel which contains a local pattern of pixel-based categories. This pattern is eﬃciently
represented by a histogram of primitive pattern features and a distance between two motifels
is calculated as a distance between two histograms. The cost of initial pixel-base classiﬁcation
of an image has not been considered here because there is a vast dataset of images that have
been already classiﬁed. The advantage of using classiﬁed data is that the method can be used
not just for images but also for other spatial data, such as, for example, topography.
A successful and computationally eﬃcient regionalization of the test site indicates that a
similar (with local landscapes having 3 km scale) regionalization of the entire U.S. using the
NLCD is viable. As we expect segmentation of the entire U.S. to yield a large number of
segments, a clustering technique more eﬃcient [21] than hierarchical clustering will need to be
applied in the last step of our procedure. Our method can contribute to a better delineation of
ecological land types [22] across the US. and world-wide.
