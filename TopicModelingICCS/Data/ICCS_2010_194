Abstract
The FFT EnKF data assimilation method is proposed and applied to a stochastic cell simulation of an epidemic,
based on the S-I-R spread model. The FFT EnKF combines spatial statistics and ensemble ﬁltering methodologies into
a localized and computationally inexpensive version of EnKF with a very small ensemble, and it is further combined
with the morphing EnKF to assimilate changes in the position of the epidemic.

1. Introduction
Starting a model from initial conditions and then waiting for the result is rarely satisfactory. The model is generally
incorrect, data is burdened with errors, and new data comes in that needs to be accounted for. This is a well-known
problem in weather forecasting, and techniques to incorporate new data by sequential statistical estimation are known
as data assimilation [1]. The ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF) [2] is a popular data assimilation method, which is easy
to implement without any change in the model. The EnKF evolves an ensemble of simulations, and the model only
needs to be capable of exporting its state and restarting from the state modiﬁed by the EnKF. However, the ensemble
size required can be large (easily in the hundreds), the amount of computations in the EnKF can be signiﬁcant, special
localization techniques need to be employed to suppress spurious long-range correlations in the ensemble covariance
matrix, and the EnKF does not work well for problems with sharp coherent features, such as the travelling waves
found in epidemics and wildﬁres.
We propose a variant of EnKF based on the Fast Fourier transform (FFT), which reduces signiﬁcantly the amount
of computations required by the EnKF, as well as the ensemble size. The use of FFT is inspired by spatial statistic:
FFT EnKF assumes that the state approximately a stationary random ﬁeld, that is, the covariance between two points
is mainly a function of their distance vector. Then the multiplication of the covariance matrix and a vector is a

convolution. In addition, the morphing transform [3] is used here so that changes of the state both in position and in
amplitude are possible.
The FFT EnKF with morphing is illustrated here for tracking a simulated epidemic wave. The use of data assimilation techniques can increase the accuracy and reliability of epidemic tracking by using the data as soon as they are
available, and some applications of data assimilation in epidemiology already exist [4, 5]. The FFT EnKF with morphing has the potential to reduce complicated simulations and accurate real-time use of data to a laptop or a smartphone
in the ﬁeld.
For FFT EnKF in a wildﬁre simulation, see [6]. The Fourier domain Kalman ﬁlter (FDKF) [7] consists of the
Kalman ﬁlter used in each Fourier mode separately.
The covariance of a stationary random ﬁeld can be estimated from a single realization by the covariogram [8],
which can be computed eﬃciently by the FFT [9]. We propose to use the covariogram for an EnKF with an ensemble
of one, which will be further developed elsewhere.
2. FFT EnKF
The EnKF approximates the probability distribution of the model state u by an ensemble of simulations u1 , . . . , uN .
Each member is advanced by the simulation in time independently. When new data d arrives, it is given as data
likelihood d ∼ N (Hu, R), where H is the observation operator and R is the data error covariance matrix. Now the
forecast ensemble [uk ] is combined with the data by the EnKF analysis [10]
uak = uk + C N H T HC N H T + R

−1

d + ek − Hukf ,

k = 1, . . . , N,

(1)

to yield the analysis ensemble uak . Here, C N is an approximation of the covariance C of the model state, taken to
be the covariance of the ensemble, and ek is sampled from N (0, R). The analysis ensemble is then advanced by the
simulations in time again. In [11], it was proved that the ensemble converges for large N to a sample from the Kalman
ﬁltering distribution when all probability distributions are Gaussian. Of course, the EnKF is used for more general
cases as well.
When C N is the ensemble covariance, the EnKF formulation (1) does not take advantage of any special structure
of the model. This allows a simple and eﬃcient implementation [12], but large ensembles, often over 100, are needed
[2]. In an application, variables in the state are random ﬁelds, and the covariance decays with spatial distance [8].
Tapering is the multiplication of sample covariance term-by-term with a ﬁxed decay function that drops oﬀ with the
distance. Tapering improves the accuracy of the approximate covariance for small ensembles [13], but it makes the
implementation of (1) more expensive: the sample covariance matrix can no longer be eﬃciently represented as the
product of two much smaller dense matrices, but it needs to be manipulated as a large, albeit sparse, matrix. Random
ﬁelds in geostatistics are often assumed to be stationary, that is, the covariance between two points depends on their
spatial distance vector only.
The FFT EnKF discussed here uses a very small ensemble, but larger than one. We explain the FFT EnKF in
the 1D case; higher-dimensional cases are exactly the same. Consider ﬁrst the case when the model state consists of
one block only. Denote by u (xi ), i = 1, . . . , n the entry of vector u corresponding to node xi . If the random ﬁeld is
stationary, the covariance matrix satisﬁes C xi , x j = c xi − x j for some covariance function c, and multiplication by
C is the convolution
n

v (xi ) =

n

C xi , x j u x j =
j=1

j=1

u x j c xi − x j ,

i = 1, . . . , n.

After FFT, convolution becomes entry-by-entry multiplication of vectors, that is, multiplication by a diagonal matrix.
We assume that the random ﬁeld is approximately stationary, so we neglect the oﬀ-diagonal terms of the covariance
matrix in the frequency domain, which leads to the the following FFT EnKF method. First apply FFT to each member,
uk = Fuk . Next, approximate the forecast covariance matrix in the frequency domain by the diagonal matrix with the
diagonal entries given by

Then deﬁne approximate covariance matrix C N by term-by-term multiplication · in the Fourier domain

3. Morphing EnKF
Given an initial state u, the initial ensemble in the morphing EnKF [3, 12] is given by
(i)
(i)
(I + T k ) ,
u(i)
k = uN+1 + rk ◦

k = 1, . . . , N,

(8)

with an additional member uN+1 = u, called the reference member. In (8), rk(i) are random smooth functions on Ω,
T k are random smooth mappings T k : Ω → Ω, and ◦ denotes composition. Thus, the initial ensemble varies both
in amplitude and in position, and the change position is the same in all blocks. The random smooth functions and
mapping are generated by FFT as Fourier series with random coeﬃcients with zero mean and variance that decays
quickly with frequency.
The data d is an observation of u(1) . The ﬁrst blocks of all members u1 , . . . , uN and d are then registered against
the ﬁrst block of uN+1 as

(I + T k ) ,
u(1)

T k ≈ 0,

∇T k ≈ 0,

k = 0, . . . , N,

u(1)
0 = d and T k : Ω → Ω, k = 0, . . . , N are called registration mappings. The registration mapping is found by
multilevel optimization. The morphing transform maps each ensemble member uk into the extended state vector, the
morphing representation,
uk → uk = MuN+1 (uk ) = T k , rk(1) , . . . , rk(M) ,

FFT EnKF method (6) is applied to the transformed ensemble u1 , . . . , uN . The covariance C (11) in (5) consists of three

4. Epidemic model
The epidemic model that we used for this study is a spatial version of the common S-I-R dynamic epidemic model.
A person is susceptible or infectious in this context if he or she can contract or transmit the disease, respectively. The
removed state includes those who have either died, have been quarantined, or have recovered from the disease and
become immune. The state variables are the susceptible (S ), the infectious (I), and the removed (R) population
densities.The core ideas for this model date back to the 1957 spatial formulation by Bailey [14], but the speciﬁc
version that we have employed here is due to Hoppenstaedt [15, p. 64].
The population is considered to be dispersed over a planar domain Ω ⊂ R2 , and it is labelled according to its
position with respect to the spatial coordinates x and y. The (deterministic) evolution of the state (S (t) , I (t) , R (t)) is
given by

The function q (x, y, t) gives the rate of removal of infectives due to death, quarantine, or recovery. The weight
function w (x, y, u, v) measures the inﬂuence of infectives at spatial position (u, v) on the exposure of susceptibles
at position (x, y); in this simulation we used the function w (x, y, u, v) = α exp −((x − u)2 + (y − v)2 )1/2 /λ , which
expresses the idea that the inﬂuence of nearby infectives decays as an exponential function of Euclidean distance,
with constant λ, characteristic of the distance at which the disease spreads. More mobile societies will have larger
values of λ. The parameter α measures the infectiousness of the disease.
A stochastic cell model is created by treating the quantities on the right-hand-side of (12) as the intensities of a
Poisson process and by piecewise constant integration over the cells. The domain Ω is decomposed into nonoverlapping cells Ωi with centers (xi , yi ) and areas A (Ωi ), i = 1, . . . , K. The state in the cell Ωi is the random element
(S i , Ii , Ri ), advanced in time over the interval [t, t + Δt] by
S i (t + Δt) = S i (t) − ΔS i ,

Ii (t + Δt) = Ii (t) + ΔS i − ΔRi ,

Ri (t + Δt) = Ri (t) + ΔRi ,

where the random increments ΔS i and ΔRi are sampled from
ΔS i ∼ Pois S i (t)

K
j=1 w

xi , yi , x j , y j I j (t) A (Ωi ) Δt ,

(13)

ΔRi ∼ Pois (qi (t) Ii (t) A (Ωi ) Δt) ,

and qi (t) is the given removal rate in the cell Ωi . The summation in (13) is done only over the cells Ω j near Ωi ;
for far away cells, the weights w xi , yi , x j , y j are negligible. It is not necessary to compute a Poisson-distributed
transmission rate from each source cell to a given target cell, because a ﬁnite sum of independent Poisson-distributed
random variables, each with its own intensity parameter, is itself Poisson-distributed with an intensity parameter equal
to the sum of the individual intensities.

5. Computational results
We have chosen to model an epidemic disease that ﬁrst emerges in Congo. The computational domain is a square
portion of central Africa. In Figure 1 (a), we see the epidemic wave 120 model time steps after the emergence of the
disease. The behavior of the model is such that any spurious infection will tend to grow into a secondary infection
wave. This is problematic for data assimilation because the occurrence of spurious features is virtually guaranteed.
We attempt to reduce the occurrence and magnitude of these features using the morphing transformation and FFT
EnKF; however, some amount of residual artifacts will remain. We have found that by processing the model state in
the following manner, we can further reduce these artifacts. We begin by scaling the absolute quantities contained
in the model variables to a percentage of the local population before performing the data assimilation. After data
assimilation, we truncate the variables to the range [0, 1], and we apply a threshold so that any infection rate below
1% is set to 0. Finally, we rescale the output in absolute units ensuring that the number of people at each grid cell is
preserved. We have applied the FFT EnKF to the epidemic model described in Section 4 with an ensemble of size 5.
Each ensemble simulation was started with the same initial conditions, but with diﬀerent random seeds, and advanced
in time by 100 model time units, then perturbed randomly to obtain the initial ensemble. The analysis ensemble and
data were advanced in time an additional 20 model time steps for further assimilation cycles. In total, 3 assimilation
cycles were performed in this manner.
We have perturbed each member of the initial ensemble randomly in space by applying (10) to the each variable
of the morphing representation of the model. The mappings T k for this perturbation were generated from a space of
smooth functions that are zero at the boundary. While the residuals rk are customarily initialized to smooth random
ﬁelds as well, we have chosen to set rk = 0 to avoid spurious infections. We instead multiply each ﬁeld after the
inverse morphing transform by 1 + sk , where sk is another smooth random ﬁeld. This ensures that an initial infection
rate of 0 is unchanged by the perturbation. A part of a typical ensemble with spatial as well as amplitude variability is
shown Figure 1 (b).
The output of the observation function used in this example consists of the Infected ﬁeld of the model. In this case,
the data is a spatial “image” of the number of infected persons in each grid cell. The data were generated synthetically
from a model simulation, which was initialized in the same manner as the ensemble.
Four variants of the EnKF were then applied: the standard EnKF and FFT EnKF and morphing EnKF and morphing FFT EnKF. The same initial ensemble and the same data were used for each method. The deviation of the initial
ensemble and the model error were chosen so that the analysis should be about half way between the forecast and
the data. In the morphing variants, the data deviation in the amplitude was taken very large, so that the ﬁlter updates
essentially only the position. Ensemble of size 5 was used. The result in the ﬁrst assimilation cycle for each method
is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The ﬁrst image in each column is the forecast mean. In the morphing variants, the mean
is taken over all ensemble members in all ﬁelds of the morphing representation (9) and it plays the role of the comparison state for registration. Thus, in the morphing variants, both the amplitude and the position of the infection wave
in the ensemble members are averaged. The second image in each column is the data, which is a model trajectory
started from the same initial state for each method. Because the model is itself stochastic, the data images are slightly
diﬀerent. The third image in each column is the analysis mean, which is taken in the morphing representation (11) for
two morphing ﬁlters, so that both the amplitude and the location are averaged.
We see that both standard EnKF and FFT EnKF ﬁlters cannot move the state towards the data; a much larger
ensemble would be needed. The morphing EnKF does move the state towards the data, but there are strong artifacts
due to the poor approximation of the covariance by the covariance of the small ensemble. Finally, the morphing
FFT-EnKF is capable of moving the state towards the data better.

6. Conclusion
We have introduced morphing FFT EnKF and presented preliminary results on data assimilation for an epidemic
simulation. Morphing was essential to move the state towards the data, but it resulted in artifacts for the small
ensemble size used, yet small ensemble size is important to perform simulations with data assimilation on general
computing devices instead of supercomputers. We have observed that the estimation of the covariance matrix in the
