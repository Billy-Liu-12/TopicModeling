Introduction

Phase transforming solids, in particular metallic alloys with large diﬀerences in
lattice constants of their crystollographic variants have interesting properties.
The variants (phases) which exist at low temperature are called martensites
and the parent state which exists at high temperature is called austenite. When
temperature is increased, the martensites are transformed to austenite at certain
critical temperature. Further, when mechanical force is applied at constant temperature, the structure undergoes a diﬀerent transformation path from austenite
to martensites and recovers the original shape. This is known as shape memory
eﬀect. The associated strain can be quite large (6% − 50%) depending upon
the size of the sample. Shape memory eﬀect has wide range of applications in
mechanical, bio-medical and micro-device engineering. Due to thermomechanically coupled phase transformation which is not diﬀusive but of ﬁrst-order type,
and which produces microstructures with sharp interfaces with large rotations
of lattice vectors, the experimental, analytical and computational characterization of the material properties and overall structural responses become highly
challenging. There are three important mathematical and computational issues
for reliable numerical simulation of shape-memory alloys, which are (1) an accurate description of the free energy density, its frame-invariance and material
symmetry properties [1, 2], (2) prediction of the microstructures [2, 3] and their
evolutions [4, 5, 6] and (3) prediction of the thermo-mechanical hysteresis at the
macroscopic scale, which is important in the numerical simulation based design
of shape-memory alloy devices [7]. Therefore, a challenging task is to address all
of the above objectives systematically within a uniﬁed modeling, analysis and
computational framework. In this paper we report a ﬁnite element based numerical simulation of phase transformations in shape memory alloy thin ﬁlms. The
computational model is based on a Ginzburg-Landau free energy description,

detailed analytical studies of which can be found in [8, 9, 10, 11]. Applications of
the Landau theory to the description of ﬁrst-order martensitic phase transitions
can be found in [12]. Also, numerical simulations of microstructure due to cubic
to tetragonal transformation in thin ﬁlms based on continuum theory of lattice
have been reported [3], where quadratic polynomial of the strain invariants have
been employed to construct the free energy densities separately for the austenite and the martensites. In the above work, a free-boundary type variational
formulation was employed for quasi-static analysis of microstructure.
In order to perform numerical simulations, we have developed a variational
framework and a ﬁnite element code, wherein a general thermo-mechanical
loading can be handled while studying the lattice-based kinetics of the microstructures. The computational model developed here employs a variational
framework, where the thermodynamic conservation law couples the mechanical
deformation, temperature and the order variables. The order variables describe
the type of phase (parent austenite phase or a martensitic variant) at a material
point. The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we summarize the GinzburgLandau free energy coupled model, which has been implemented in the variational framework. The variational framework and the ﬁnite element formulation
are discussed in Sec. 3. Computational issues are discussed in Secs. 4 and 5.
Numerical results for cubic to tetragonal phase transformations in Ni-Al thin
ﬁlms are reported in Sec 6.

Ginzburg-Landau Free Energy Model

We denote the order variables ηk ∈ [0, 1], where k = 1, · · · , N indicates the
number of martensitic variants, ηk = 0 ∀k deﬁnes the austenite and ηk = 1 , ηj =
0 , k = j deﬁnes the kth martensitic variant at a material point. According to
the point group of crystallographic symmetry, only one type of martensite is
allowed to exist at a material point. Denoting the vector of the order variables
as η = {η1 , · · · , ηN }T , the Gibbs free energy density is deﬁned as G(σ, θ, η).
Here σ is the stress tensor, θ is the temperature. The ﬁnite strain tensor ε is
decomposed into the elastic part and the transformation-induced part as
N

εtk ϕ(ηk ) ,

ε = εel +

(1)

k=1

where ϕ(ηk ) is a polynomial in ηk and εtk , k = 1, · · · , N are the transformation strain tensors [2] obtained using experiments. The structure of the initially
unknown polynomial ϕ(ηk ) is such that it satisﬁes the following two conditions:
ϕ(0) = 0 ,

ϕ(1) = 1 .

(2)

The frame-invariance property of the free energy density is imposed by the
polynomial structure in ηk such that interchanges between two indices produce
identical structure of G. Material symmetry under proper rotation of the lattice

vector is preserved due to the decomposition in Eq. (1). The Gibbs free energy
density then takes the following form.

where λk is the second-order forth-rank compliance tensor for the kth martensitic variant (Mk phase), λ0 is for austenite phase (A phase), εθ0 = α0 (θ − θe ),
εθk = αk (θ − θe ). θe is the temperature at which the stress-free martensite losses
stability. α0 and αk are the thermal expansion tensors for A and Mk phases,
respectively. f (θ, ηk ) is the chemical part of the free energy of the Mk phases
and assumed in the form of a polynomial which is to be determined. Fij is an
interaction potential required to preserve the frame-invariance of G with respect
to the point group of symmetry and uniqueness of the multivariant phase transformation at a given material point. The description of the order variables can
now be generalized with three sets of order parameters: ¯0 = {0, ηk = 0, 0} for A
phase, ¯
1 = {0, ηk = 1, 0} for Mk phase and η¯k = {0, ηk , 0}, ηk ∈ (0, 1) for diﬀused
A − Mk interface. The role of the ﬁrst-order kinetics in the order variables is to
assist in reaching the bottom of the energy well, i.e.,

The transformation energy associated with A ↔ Mk transformation is

(7)

where ΔGθ is the jump in the free energy due to phase transformation. With the
help of Eqs. (2)-(7), we determine ϕ(ηk ) and f (θ, ηk ) (see [10] for the details).
According to Landau theory, a quadratic polynomial in strain components can
be adequate to describe the free energy. Therefore, following Eq. (1), one ﬁnds
that for cubic to tetragonal transformation, the interaction potential has the
following form (see [9] for the details)
Fij = ηi ηj (1 − ηi − ηj ) B (ηi − ηj )2 − ηi − ηj + Dηi ηj + ηi2 ηj2 (ηi Zij + ηj Zji )
(8)
where the material constants B and D are obtained from experiments or numerical estimation. The matrix elements Zij are obtained as functions of the
constants B and D and an energy scale factor in f (θ, ηk ).

Thermodynamic Conservation

Note that a jump in the free energy ΔGθ has been introduced in Eq. (7). The
consequence of this jump, as well as the jump in the total strain across the A−Mj
interface, is the thermodynamic forcing as a source of dissipation. The forcing
term would eventually be balanced by the kinetic force. Therefore, one has to
establish a link between the evolution of the phases and the non-negativity of
the thermodynamic potential (Helmholtz free energy). This is unlike the notion
in plasticity-based framework (see e.g.[13]), where the non-negativity of the rate
of phase fraction is directly enforced.
For the present problem, the kinetic equation is derived by balancing the
thermodynamic force with the kinetic force as

where C is a constant and G = G + G(∇η)
describes the modiﬁed Gibbs free
energy including the gradient terms to account for the non-local nature of the
interface energy. By rearranging Eq. (9) and expanding the forcing terms, we
get the Ginzburg-Landau equation for phase kinetics, which is given by

Variational Framework and Finite Element
Discretization

We relate the elastic part of displacements to the elastic strain εel via the linear
strain-displacement relation, i.e. εel = ((∇u) + (∇u)T )/2. With this assumption
of strain and Eq. (1), it is now obvious that the order variables ηk , k = 1, · · · , N ,
are to be treated as internal variables in the variational formulation. We want
to interpolate the ﬁelds u(x, y, z, t), θ(x, y, z, t) and ηk (x, y, z, t) over the domain
Ω(x, y, z) ⊂ R2 with Lipschitz continuous boundary ∂Ω, using ﬁxed-order ﬁnite
elements with h-reﬁnement. We consider the Lagrangian isoparametric interpolation function N ,
{u1 , u2 , u3 }T = N u v e ,

Deformation, Phase Kinetics and Multiple Scales

The problem of simulating the microstructure in shape memory alloys has been
extensively discussed in the literature [1], primarily under static loadings. Dynamic loadings present a major remaining challenge in the ﬁeld. While simulating
the macroscopic deformation under dynamic loadings, resolving the sharp interfaces and the dendritic microstructure with multiscale features are some of the
key computational diﬃculties that need to be addressed. A smoothed version
of the transformation conditions in Eqs. (4)-(6) leads to the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau phase kinetics, where the fast time scale has to be controlled
depending on the global time stepping (in slow time scale) in the ﬁnite element
time integration. Note that ηk represents the reordering of the atomic ensemble
within a box (or in other words within a ﬁnite element). Choice of the lengthscale for deﬁning this box can be arrived at by applying a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme
to the phase kinetic equation. The chosen time scale for the kinetics dictates the
limit to the coarse graining of ηk . This, in turn, restricts the order of interpolation for a given size of the ﬁnite element. Since the elastic part of the strain is
deﬁned in the lattice coordinate for the current phase, special care is necessary
to ensure continuity of elastic strain and hence displacement within that phase.
For example, if linear interpolation is used for displacement and there exists a
number of elements having same phase connected to a ﬁnite element node, then
we average out the displacement for that particular node. For higher-order interpolation, this is not necessary, except when additional intermediate nodes are
used in an element for interpolation of ηk .

Computational Scheme

We have implemented the ﬁnite element model discussed in Sec. 3 in a general three-dimensional ﬁnite element code. For numerical simulation of cubic to
tetragonal transformation, we deal with three diﬀerent phases, that is N = 3. We
employ an 8-node, 7 d.o.f/node hexahedral element with tri-linear isoparametric interpolation and reduced Gauss-quadrature integration for in-plane shear
terms. Since the energy minimization process can take a diﬀerent and unphysical path, a special care should be taken in organizing nonlinear iterations. The
implemented algorithm is given below.

Numerical Simulations

A Ni-Al thin ﬁlm is considered for numerical analysis in this section as an example. The material properties are taken from [9]. 5Hz sinusoidal stress is applied
in the longitudinal direction throughout the left and right edges of the rectangular ﬁlm. The stress distribution over the edge has equilateral triangular shape.
The other two parallel edges of the ﬁlm are kept free. Constant temperature of
300K with cubic phase (austenite) is assumed to be the initial state. Figures 1
and 2, respectively, show the displacements and the nucleated phases near the
stressed left and right edges of the ﬁlm.
