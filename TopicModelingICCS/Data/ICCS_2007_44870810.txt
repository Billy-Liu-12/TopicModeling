Abstract. A lattice Boltzmann model is proposed to asses the impact
of variable molecular transport eﬀects on the heat and mass transfer in a
horizontal shallow cavity due to natural convection. The formulation includes a generalized form of the Soret and Dufour mass and heat diﬀusion
(cross diﬀusion) vectors derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics
and ﬂuctuation theory. Both the individual cross diﬀusion eﬀect and
combined eﬀects on transport phenomena are considered. Results from
numerical simulations indicate that Soret mass ﬂux and Dufour energy
ﬂux have appreciable eﬀect and sometimes are signiﬁcant. At the same
time, the lattice Boltzmann model has been proved to be adequate to
describe higher order eﬀects on energy and mass transfer.
Keywords: lattice Boltzmann model; Soret eﬀect; Dufour eﬀect; Natural

Introduction

Transport phenomena and thermo-physical property in ﬂuid convection submitted to the inﬂuence of thermal and concentration horizontal gradients arise in
many ﬁelds of science and engineering. The conservation equations which describe the transport of energy and mass in these ﬂuid systems are well developed [1-3]. The energy ﬂux includes contributions due to a temperature gradient
(Fourier heat conduction), concentration gradient(Dufour diﬀusion) and a term
which accounts for the energy transport as a results of each species having different enthalpies (species interdiﬀusion). The mass ﬂux consists of terms due

to a concentration gradient (Fickian diﬀusion), temperature gradient (Soret diffusion), Pressure gradient (pressure diﬀusion) and a term which accounts for
external forces aﬀecting each species by a diﬀerent magnitude. However, most
studies concerned on transport phenomena only considered the contributions
due to Fourier heat conduction and Fickian diﬀusion.
The Soret mass ﬂux and Dufour energy ﬂux become signiﬁcant when the
thermal diﬀusion factor and the temperature and concentration gradients are
large. Actually, Rosner [4] has stressed that Soret diﬀusion is signiﬁcant in several
important engineering applications. Similarly, Atimtay and Gill [5] have shown
Soret and Dufour diﬀusion to be appreciable for convection on a rotating disc.
An error as high as 30% for the wall mass ﬂux is introduced when the Soret
eﬀect is not accounted for. Of particular interest, crystal growth from the vapor
is sometimes carried out under conditions conductive to Soret and Dufour eﬀects.
As greater demands are made for tighter control of industrial processes, such as
in microelctromechanical systems (MEMS) [6], second-order eﬀects such as Soret
and Dufour diﬀusion may have to be included.
In regard to actual energy and mass transport in double diﬀusive convection
ﬂuid systems which include Soret and Dufour cross diﬀusion eﬀect, little, if
any, complete and detailed work has been done. However, a few studies have
considered the convection, within a vertical cavity, induced by Soret eﬀects. The
ﬁrst study on this topic is due to Bergman and Srinivasan [7]. Their numerical
results indicate that the Soret-induced buoyancy eﬀects are more important
when convection is relatively weak. The particular case of a square cavity under
the inﬂuence of thermal and solutal buoyancy forces, which are opposing and
of equal intensity, has been investigated by Traore and Mojtabi [8]. The Soret
eﬀect on the ﬂow structures was investigated numerically. The same problem
was considered by Krishnan [9] and Gobin and Bennacer [10] for the case of an
inﬁnite vertical ﬂuid layer. The critical Rayleigh number for the onset of motion
was determined by these authors. More recently, Ouriemi et al. [11] considered
the case of a shallow layer of a binary ﬂuid submitted to the inﬂuence of thermal
and concentration horizontal gradients with Soret eﬀects. Moreover, few studies
have been concerned with the Soret and Dufour eﬀects at the same time. Weaver
and Viskanta numerically simulates these eﬀects in a cavity [12]. Malashetty
et al.[13] have performed an stability analysis of this problem. Because of the
limited number of studies available, the knowledge concerning the inﬂuence of
these eﬀects on the heat and mass transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow is incomplete.
The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a new method for simulating ﬂuid
ﬂow and modeling physics in ﬂuids. It has shown its power and advantages in
wide range of situations for its mesoscopic nature and the distinctive computational features [14,15,16]. Contrary to the conventional numerical methods, the
LBM has many special advantages in simulating physical problems. The objective of the present study is to develop an eﬀective lattice Boltzmann model to
examine the inﬂuences and the contributions of the Soret and Dufour eﬀects
on the natural convection with simultaneous heat and mass transfer across a
horizontal shallow cavity. Based on the idea of the double distribution function

models for a ﬂuid ﬂow involving heat transfer, a generalized lattice Boltzmann
model is proposed to solve the control equations with Soret and Dufour eﬀects.

The Lattice Boltzmann Method for the Formulation of
the Problem

The conﬁguration considered in this study is a horizontal shallow cavity, of width
H and length L. The top and bottom end walls were assumed to be adiabatic
and impermeable to heat and mass transfer while the boundary conditions along
the right and left side walls were subjected by Dirichlet conditions. Considering the Soret eﬀects and Dufour eﬀects, the dimensionless incompressible ﬂuid
equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, solutal concentration, and
temperature, with the inclusion of the Boussinesq approximation for the density
variation, are written as
∇ · u = 0,

along with the boundary conditions where ρ and u are the ﬂuid density and
velocity, respectively. T is the temperature of the ﬂuid.
The dimensionless variables are deﬁned as

Here,ν, α, D are the kinematic viscosity, thermal diﬀusivity and diﬀusion coeﬃcient,respectively. The remaining notation is conventional. From the above
equations it is observed that the present problem is governed by the thermal
Rayleigh number Ra, buoyancy ratio ϕ, Lewis number Le, Prandtl number P r,
Dofour factor DCT and Soret factor ST C . In this paper, we concerned on the
eﬀect of Soret and Dufour factor. So other dimensionless variables will be kept
at certain values.
Based on the idea of TLBGK model in [17], we take the temperature and concentration as passive scalar. Then the control equations of velocity, temperature
and concentration can be treated individually. The evolution equation for the
velocity ﬁeld is similar to Ref. [18]
fi (x + ci Δt, t + Δt) − fi (x, t) = − τ1 (fi (x, t) − fieq (x, t))

where ci is the discrete particle velocity, Fi represents the force term, fi (x, t) is
the distribution function (DF) for the particle with velocity ci at position x and
time t, Δt is the time increment. τ is the nondimensional relaxation time and
(eq)
is the equilibrium distribution function (EDF). The EDF must be deﬁned
fi
appropriately such that the mass and momentum are conserved and some symmetry requirements are satisﬁed in order to describe the correct hydrodynamics
of the ﬂuid. In the DnQb[19] models, the EDF is now deﬁned as

where ωi is the weight and cs is the sound speed. Both ωi and cs depend on the

given by c0 = 0, and√ci = λi (cos θi , sin θi )c with λi = 1, θi = (i − 1)π/2√for
i = 1 − 4, and λi = 2, θi = (i − 5)π/2 + π/4 for i = 5 − 8, and cs = c/ 3.

Through the Chapman-Enskog expansion, the Eqs.(1),(2) can be obtained. The

Similarly, the LBGK equations for temperature and concentration ﬁelds with

Si (x + ci Δt, t + Δt) − Si (x, t) = − τ1S [Si (x, t) − Si (x, t)]

where Ti and Si are the DF for the temperature ﬁeld and concentration ﬁeld,
respectively. τT and τS are relaxation time corresponding to temperature DF and
concentration DF trend to equilibrium. Just like the thoughts of constructing
generalized LBGK model for Burgers equation [21], the EDF of temperature and

It can be proved that the macroscopic temperature and concentration diﬀusion
equations (3) and (4) can be recovered from LBE(9),(10). The corresponding

Here, d0 and l0 are adjustable parameters. Obviously, the lattice Boltzmann
model can simulate the double diﬀusive not only including Fourier heat conduction and Fickian diﬀusion but also second-order cross diﬀusion by choosing
adequate parameters.

Numerical Results and Discussion

Using the lattice Boltzmann model, we simulate the Soret and Dufour eﬀects
in double diﬀusive due to temperature and concentration gradient. Since the
Soret and Dufour eﬀects are diﬀusive processes, the Rayleigh number should
not too high in order to decrease the advective ﬂux relative to the diﬀusive
ﬂux. Furthermore, the buoyancy ratio is set to be ϕ = 1, which preserves the
buoyancy forces induced by the thermal and solutal eﬀects are of equal intensity.
Simulation tests are conducted with varied Soret and Dufour factor and ﬁxed
Le and P r number equal to 1 and 0.71, respectively. The lattice size is 128 × 256
with Ra equal to 103 .
Streamlines, isothermals and iso-concentration proﬁles varied with Dufour and
Soret coeﬃcients are shown in Fig. 1. The eﬀect on mass, momentum and concentration transports made by varied cross diﬀusion coeﬃcients can be observed
obviously. The center velocity, local (averaged) Nusselt and Sherwood number
on the left wall are showed in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Table 1 for detailed discussion, respectively. A positive (negative) value of Dufour and Soret coeﬃcients
decreases (increases) the value of the maximum velocity, and extends (reduces)
the range of the velocity ﬁeld. Moreover, Positive values for the Dufour and
Soret coeﬃcients yield solute concentrations below that of the free stream and
so is the temperature, the opposite being also true. But when the Dufour coefﬁcient is certain, the local Nusselt numbers decrease with Soret coeﬃcients but
local Sherwood number increase. While the Soret coeﬃcient is certain, the local
Nusselt numbers increse and the Sherwood number decrease instead. All curves
show the expected behavior.

Summary

In this paper,a lattice Boltzmann model is proposed and used to asses the Soret
and Dufour eﬀects on the heat and mass transfer in a horizontal shallow cavity
due to natural convection. The proposed model is constructed in the double
distribution function framework. Cross diﬀusion eﬀects are studied under the
buoyancy counteracting ﬂows and augmenting ﬂows in shallow cavity with the
lattice Boltzmann model. The numerical results show that Soret and Dufour
eﬀects have contributions to mass and energy ﬂux. Sometimes, it may appears
to signiﬁcant. Simulation results agree well with previous work. Moreover, it
indicates that the lattice Boltzmann model is adequate to simulate molecular
transport which even includes second-order eﬀects. It seems that the lattice
Boltzmann method is eﬀective in describing higher order physical eﬀects, which
are important as the industry develops.
