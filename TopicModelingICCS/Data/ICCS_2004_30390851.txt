Abstract. Research into the direction of speciﬁc exotic options - like the
Parisians - is often driven by the analysis of structured products. These
products contain features that are similar to exotic options. Exchangetrading of the pure exotics is very rare. In the period of rising stock
markets, investors were less interested in buying bonds. In order to regain their interest, ﬁrms added extra features to the bonds they wanted
to issue. One of these features is the right of the bond holder to convert
the bond into a given number of stocks under certain conditions. Bonds
with this feature are called convertible bonds and are nowadays very
common. Most convertible bonds can be re-called by the issuer when the
convertible trades above some level for some period. Modelling this feature corresponds to valuation of a Parisian option. In this paper we will
point out how we quickly can approximate the Parisian option price by
using a standard barrier option with a modiﬁed barrier. This is common
practice for traders; they increase or decrease the barrier a bit. Here we
want to argue what that bit should be. First we will introduce the Parisian contract. Thereafter we list the methods of valuing the Parisian,
followed by a section about the implied barrier method. Here we will
use concepts from the theory on Brownian excursions and exploit them
to derive prices for Parisians that are already in the excursion. We will
conclude with a numerical example.

The Parisian Contract

Let {St , Ft ; t ≥ 0} be a process deﬁned on the ﬁltered probability space (Ω, F, Ft ,
P). According to the Black-Scholes model we have for the risk neutral price
process
St = s0 exp (r − 0.5σ 2 )t + σBt ,
where {Bt , Ft ; t ≥ 0} denotes a standard Brownian Motion, s0 the initial value
of the stock, r the interest rate and σ the volatility. We can use this risk-neutral
stock price process to calculate the price of a derivative VΦ with some (path
dependent) pay-oﬀ Φ ((St )0≤t≤T ) at time T by,
VΦ = e−rT E [Φ ((St )0≤t≤T )] .
Here Φ is the contract function. A standard barrier option is a derivative that
pays oﬀ like a put or a call that knocks in or out as soon as the stock price hits

some level. The Parisian option is like a barrier, but we do not only assume the
stock price to hit some level, but also to stay above or below that level for a
given time. For a given t let (γt , βt ) be the excursion from level L straddling t,
i.e.
γt := sup {Ss = L}
s≤t

and βt := inf {Ss = L}.
s≥t

−
Now we can use these random variables to deﬁne TD
, the ﬁrst time (St )t≥0 is
+
below L longer than D and TD the equivalent random time for staying above L
by
−
TD
:= inf {t − γt > D; St < L}
t>0

+
:= inf {t − γt > D; St > L}.
and TD
t>0

+
−
For an up and down Parisian we use TD
respectively TD
. If it is a knock in
±
we consider the set {TD ≤ T } otherwise we consider its complement. With this
notation we can write pricing formulae for all kinds of Parisian options, e.g. the
Parisian down and in call is given by

VP DIC = e−rT E (ST − X) 1{T − ≤T } ,
+

D

where X denotes the strike of the call. By changing the set of the indicator, we
can calculate all variations of down/out and up/in. By changing the left part of
the pay-oﬀ, we can compute prices for Parisian puts instead of calls.

Valuation Methods for Parisians

There are two well-known methods for valuing Parisians. One method [6] uses
the Black-Scholes PDE with boundary conditions adapted to the Parisian contract. This modiﬁed PDE is then solved by numerical methods. The advantage
of this method is, that the pricing framework is ﬂexible, i.e. it is possible to deal
with discrete dividends and early exercise. The disadvantage is that the convergence is slow. There are methods using some pre-calculated values [5] to increase
this convergence. This method is relatively time-consuming in the sense that it
is inappropriate for real-time option pricing
Another method calculates the Laplace Transforms of these option prices [2].
There exist quick inversion algorithms [1] to obtain the prices within a given
error bound.
Here we propose another method, the so-called implied barrier method. This
method consists of coming up with an implied barrier L∗ . Then the standard
barrier option with barrier L∗ and the remaining parameters equal to the Parisian has the same price as the Parisian. This method only uses standard barrier
formulae for the European case and obtaining prices is neither diﬃcult nor timeconsuming.

The Implied Barrier

Explaining the implied barrier method is threefold. At ﬁrst we deﬁne the implied
barrier and give a numerical example. Then we come up with heuristics about
what the implied barrier should be and use excursion theory to obtain a formula
for it. Finally, we will show for a practical example that prices are quite close.
Denoting the ﬁrst time (St ) hits L by TL , the price of a call with barrier L∗ is
given by
+
VDIC := e−rT E (ST − X) 1{TL∗ ≤T } .
We know that for L = L∗ the Parisian option should have a value smaller
than this standard barrier, but positive. By decreasing L∗ we can have the
value of this barrier every value between the (L∗ = L)-case and 0, so for some
particular L∗ the standard barrier has the same price as the Parisian. This particular value of L∗ is deﬁned as the implied barrier and can formally be stated as:
Deﬁnition
Let Φ(ST ) the vanilla part of the payoﬀ of a Parisian Up contract. Then for
L > S0 the implied barrier L∗ is deﬁned by
E[Φ(ST )1{T +

D,L ≤T }

] = E[Φ(ST )1{TL∗ ≤T } ].

For L < S0 we deﬁne the implied barrier L∗ by
E[Φ(ST )1{T −

D,L ≤T }

] = E[Φ(ST )1{TL∗ ≤T } ].

By continuity it is clear that L∗ always exists. In the graph in ﬁgure 1 we
show the implied barrier for a down-and-in Parisian call for diﬀerent times to
maturity and diﬀerent values of s0 . The Parisian prices we needed for ﬁnding
this barrier are computed by a numerical inversion of the Laplace Transforms.
For this particular option the graph shows that the implied barrier is in the
same range for diﬀerent T and s0 . However, by basic monotonicity arguments
we have the following proposition.
Proposition
Let Φ(ST ) be the vanilla part of a Parisian contract. Suppose for a down
contract with L < S0 that for some ﬁnite T > D > 0 we have
E[Φ(ST )1{T −

D,L ≤T }

] > 0.

Then L∗ (t), the implied barrier for this contract with maturity t cannot be the
same for every t ∈ [D, T ]. Moreover L∗ (s0 ), the implied barrier for this contract
with initial stock price s0 cannot be the same for every s0 > L.
Considering the scale of the vertical axis in the ﬁgure on the next page,
we will try to approximate this implied barrier by a constant. In the next
section we arrive intuitively at the approximation. Using this approximation we
come up with a numerical example.

Approximating the Implied Barrier

In order to arrive at the approximation, we argue that the implied barrier should
be - whether the contract is of the up or down type - the minimum or maximum
we expect (St ) to attain, given that the stock follows a path in the Parisian
±
set. For the Parisian contracts we are interested in the set {TD
≤ T } and its
complement. So, either the realizations of (St ) do contain an excursion in the
right direction w.r.t. to L longer than D or not. If we consider for example the
down and in version and divide the stock path into its excursions from L, we
can compute the expected minimum that is attained in each separate excursion
below L. The minimum the stock path attains up to time T is the minimum
of all these expected minima per excursion. We know from excursion theory
that the expected minimum of an excursion decreases when the length of the
excursion increases. In this down and in case we know that we need to have at
least one excursion longer than D, so the expected minimum of the knocking-in
stock paths should be below the minimum that we expect to attain during an
excursion below L of length D. Using Brownian excursion theory [3,4] we have
for the expected minimum mD of an Brownian excursion with length D
E[mD ] =

Dπ
.
2

As we are dealing with geometric Brownian motion, this term will appear within
an exponential. Furthermore we are considering an excursion around the level
˜ ∗ for the implied barrier L∗
L, so we ﬁnd the following approximation L

˜ ∗ := L exp −σ De− m2 D

where

m :=

855

r − 0.5σ 2
.
σ

Here the m is introduced as a consequence of the Girsanov transformation, that
is needed in cases where r = 0.5σ 2 . The same argumentation holds for the other
types of Parisians (up/down, out/in), where the minus sign in the exponent
˜ ∗ to
disappears for the up-variant of the Parisian contract. Now we use the L
∗
˜
approximate the value VP DIC (L) by VDIC (L ). In the next section we show how
we deal with Parisians that are already in the excursion.

Valuing Parisians That Are Already in the Excursion

Here we valuate a Parisian option at time t > 0. Suppose we are interested in
the P DIC with some barrier L. In the case St < L, the excursion of the stock
path below L has already started and this eﬀects its value. Deﬁne d as the time
the stock already spent below L by
d := t − γt .
Here we are interested in the case where d < D and another excursion longer
than D did not happen yet. It is clear that we have two possibilities now. Either
we return to the level L too early to knock in, i.e. we are in the set {TL ≤ D −d},
or, we are in the complement of this set, and so stay long enough to knock in.
Here we abuse the notation TL for the amount of time we have to wait after
time t to hit the level L, that we should write as TLt given by
TLt = inf {Ss+t = L}.
s>0

−
In the same way we will abuse the notation of TD,L
. Considering these two cases
we could be in, the value of a PDIC is given by

VP DIC (d) =e−r(T −t) E (ST − X)+ 1{TL >D−d} |Ft +
e−r(T −t) E (ST − X)+ 1{T −

D,L <T −t}

1{TL ≤D−d} |Ft .

So, in the case that we stay long enough below L we get a standard call, otherwise
we get a fresh P DIC for the remaining time to expiry. If we write 1{TL >D−d} =
1 − 1{TL ≤D−d} , we ﬁnd for VP DIC (d)
VP DIC (d) = VBSC −e−rT E (St e(r−σ

2

/2)T +σBT

− X)+ 1{T −

D,L >T

.

} 1{TL ≤D−d}

Here VBSC is the value of a standard call with time to expiration T := T − t
and we used the Markov property to remove the conditioning. Now we change
our measure to Q in the same way as above. Conditioning on FTL gives
VP DIC (d) =VBSC −
e−˜rT EQ 1{TL ≤D−d} EQ emZT (St eσZT − X)+ 1{T −

D,L >T

} |FTL

,

856

J. Anderluh and H. van der Weide

where r˜ is deﬁned by r˜ := r − 0.5m2 . Using the Markov property again, we
recognize VP DOC (T − TL ) apart from the proper discounting, so we get
VP DIC (d) := VBSC − eml EQ 1{TL ≤D−d} e−˜rTL VP DOC (T − TL ) ,
where l is deﬁned by l = σ −1 ln SLt . Using the distribution of the hitting time [3]
we can calculate the expectation. If we furthermore approximate VP DOC (T −TL )
˜ ∗ , T − TL ) we obtain
by VDOC (L

This integral should be computed numerically. In the example later on we will
show that a relatively small number of steps is suﬃcient to obtain a value close
to the true Parisian price. The same way of reasoning could be used to derive
prices for the other types of Parisian contracts.

in the upper left corner (i.e. 84.57), is recognized in the implied barrier graph
in ﬁgure 1 for the same case as shown above. As we would like to use the prices
for relatively small D, we also need deltas for D relatively large compared to T .
Table 2 shows that the error in the deltas is much less than that in the prices.

As these computations involved numerical integration we have to chose a
number of integration steps. In this numerical approximation the interval is
divided into 25 steps for D = 10/365 and D = 20/365. We divided it into 250

steps for D = 200/365. The results are analogous to the former price table. The
prices are quite good for D relative small compared to T . Again we will compute
for this particular case the deltas to show that they do not diﬀer that much, as
is shown in table 4.

Conclusion

Valuation of Parisian options is important as popular investment tools like convertible bonds exhibit the Parisian option feature. Well known methods for calculating its price are either computationally slow (PDE method) or inﬂexible
(Laplace method). Here we provide a way to use standard barrier models with
an implied barrier for calculating prices. The advantages of these method for
trading ﬁrms are threefold. First no new model has to be implemented. Moreover it is possible to value the American options with a Parisian constraint, by
using the implied barrier in the standard American barrier option. Discrete dividends can be taken into account. Finally a lot has been done pricing barriers
in a non-constant volatility environment. Using the implied barrier again yields
an approximation of the Parisian price in such an environment.
