1 Introduction
Complex geometry of modern antenna structures is a result of strict requirements imposed on their
electrical and/or field performance figures, as well as small size of modern communication systems.
Size reduction of ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas is often achieved as a result of various topological
modifications such as ground plane slots and stubs that enlarge the current path within the structure (Li,
Cheung et al. 2013), as well as feed line alterations that increase the impedance bandwidth (Bekasiewicz
and Koziel, 2015). Band-notch functionality, on the other hand, is often realized using slots within the
radiator or various resonators allocated in the vicinity (Li et al. 2012) or below the feed line (Nouri and
DadashZadeh, 2011).
Complex antenna structures are characterized by a large number of design parameters (Bekasiewicz
and Koziel, 2015). Also, they can be accurately evaluated only by means of numerically expensive highfidelity electromagnetic (EM) solvers. For the sake of design reliability, environmental components such
as connectors (Khan et al. 2016), housing (Alsath and Kanagasabai, 2015), or fixtures (Liu et al. 2012)
are often included into EM models, which additionally increases their evaluation cost. These factors
make EM-driven design of modern antennas a challenging task. Typically, it is handled manually by
means of visual inspection of the structure response intertwined with sweeping of its parameters (usually
one at a time). Although very laborious and unable to identify truly optimum designs, manual design is
still considered as a reasonable compromise between computational feasibility and efficiency. On the
other hand, conventional optimization driven by local (e.g., gradient-based, or derivative free, see:
Nocedal and Wright, 2006; Conn et al. 2009) or global (e.g., genetic algorithms, or simulated annealing,
see Ding et al. 2008; Martinez-Fernandez et al. 2007) methods are numerically prohibitive due to a large
number of EM model evaluations required to complete the process.
Antenna design normally involves several performance figures (e.g., maximization of in-band gain
(Kuwahara, 2005), minimization of reflection (Bekasiewicz and Koziel, 2015), front-to-back ratio
(Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2015), or antenna size (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013)) that have to be
simultaneously taken into account. These requirements often stay in conflict with each other meaning
that improvement of one of them is not possible without degradation of the others. For the sake of
simplicity, design requirements are often aggregated into a single-objective task using appropriate
weighting factors which allows for solving the problem using conventional optimization algorithms.
However, comprehensive information about trade-offs between various objectives (referred to as a
Pareto front) may be only obtained by means of genuine multi-objective optimization (Deb, 2001). The
most popular methods for solving multi-objective design problems are population-based metaheuristics
(e.g., evolutionary, or firefly algorithms, see e.g., Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013; Yang, 2013). Although
metaheuristics allow for generating the entire Pareto set in a single algorithm run, they typically require
thousands of model evaluations to complete the optimization process (Kuwahara, 2005). Thus, they are
unsuitable for handling expensive high-fidelity EM simulation models of antenna structures.
The cost of antenna design can be reduced using surrogate-assisted techniques, where the
optimization is executed at the level of a coarsely-discretized EM model of the structure at hand. The
optimized design is further corrected using occasionally acquired accurate EM model data. A variety of
surrogate-based methods have been successfully utilized for rapid antenna design. These include, among
others, space mapping (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013), manifold mapping (Koziel et al. 2013), shape
preserving response prediction (Koziel et al. 2012), adaptive response correction (Koziel and Ogurtsov,
2014), and, recently, utilization of response features (Koziel and Bandler, 2015). The mentioned
approaches allow for obtaining optimal design solutions at a cost corresponding to a few dozens of highfidelity EM model simulations.
Several surrogate-assisted methods for fast EM-driven multi-objective design of antenna structures
have been proposed. In (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013), the Pareto set has been obtained by metaheuristic
optimization of an auxiliary response surface approximation model constructed from the low-fidelity
EM model data. The high-fidelity representation of the Pareto front has been subsequently obtained

through space mapping correction of the selected designs. An alternative refinement strategy based on
co-kriging has been proposed in (Koziel et al. 2014a). Moreover, design space reduction schemes have
been proposed in (Koziel et al. 2014b; Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2016a) to extend applicability of the
approach to highly-dimensional problems. These techniques, however, exploit a stochastic algorithm at
certain stage of the design process. A fully deterministic method for generating Pareto set, a so-called
sequential domain patching algorithm has been proposed in (Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2016a). Another
approach that identifies the Pareto front representation in a point-by-point manner has been reported in
(Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2016c).
Recently, a Pareto ranking bisection algorithm (PRBA) for multi-objective optimization of modern
antennas has been introduced in (Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2017). PRBA is a two stage method that
generates initial approximations of the Pareto designs using bisection algorithm. The candidate solutions
are then locally improved by means of a grid-restricted search involving Pareto ranking. Low cost of
the design process is ensured by performing the search at the coarsely-discretized EM model level. The
high-fidelity EM representation of the Pareto front is found, similarly as in (Koziel and Bekasiewicz,
2016a), i.e., by optimization of local approximation surrogates generated around the designs found by
PRBA.
In this work, a numerical study concerning feasibility of PRBA for multi-objective optimization of
a numerically expensive antenna models in highly-dimensional spaces is performed. The benchmark
problem is a 17-variable uniplanar UWB structure optimized with respect to two conflicting design
requirements, i.e., minimization of in-band reflection and size reduction. The method is extensively
compared against state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithms. This is the
first attempt to investigate robustness of the PRBA approach for a design problem with over a dozen
design variables.

2 Multi-Objective Optimization Using PRBA
In this section, we recall the details of the considered Pareto ranking bisection algorithm. Specifically,
we discuss the multi-objective optimization problem formulation, as well as describe the PRBA approach.
The section is concluded with a brief explanation of the utilized response correction approach. A design
example and comparison of PRBA to benchmark algorithms is provided in Section 3.

2.1 Multi-Objective Problem Formulation
Let x denote a vector of the antenna design parameters and Rf(x) represent a response of its highfidelity EM simulation model. Then, let Fk(Rf(x)), k = 1, …, Nobj, be a kth design objective. Design
objectives can be defined with respect to antenna in-band reflection, gain, phase stability, size, etc. If
Nobj > 1, comparison of the solutions is realized using a dominance relation (Deb, 2001). We say that y
 x (y dominates over x) if Fk(Rf(y))  Fk(Rf(x)) for all k = 1, …, Nobj, and Fk(Rf(y)) < Fk(Rf(x)) for at
least one k. The goal of the multi-objective optimization is to find a Pareto set XP composed of nondominated designs so that for any x  XP there is no y for which y  x (Deb, 2001). The set XP represents
the best possible compromise between the considered objectives.
For the purpose of subsequent considerations, we also define a Pareto ranking concept. Let X = {x1,
…, xn} be a set of designs. Pareto ranking of the design xk  X with respect to X is the number of designs
from X that dominate over xk.

2.2 Pareto Ranking Bisection Algorithm
The Pareto front normally resides in the very small region of the search space, allocation of which
is unknown beforehand. Therefore, the first step of the considered multi-objective optimization
procedure is identification of the extreme Pareto-optimal designs (Koziel et al. 2014b). These are
obtained through sequential single-objective optimizations with respect to one design requirement at a
time. Low computational cost of the process is ensured by identification of the extreme points at the
coarsely-discretized EM model level of the antenna by solving
xk*  arg min Fk  Rc ( x ) 
x

(1)

for k = 1, …, Nobj (Koziel et al. 2014b). Depending on the number of antenna design parameters, the cost
of solving (1) varies from a few dozens to over a hundred evaluations of the low-fidelity model Rc per
objective.
Initial approximation of the Pareto front is obtained using the PRBA method (Koziel and
Bekasiewicz, 2017). The algorithm is formulted for bi-objective problems. The following notation is
used (n is the design space dimensionality):
 xc.0.1 = x1* and xc.0.2 = x2* – extreme Pareto designs;
 xc.i.k – kth (approximate) Pareto design found in the ith algorithm iteration; the number of new
designs found in iteration i is Ki = 2i–1; the total number of designs after ith iteration is Ni = 2i+1;
 d = [d1 … dn]T – perturbation size (user defined parameter);
 M – maximum number of PRBA iterations;
 m = [m1 … mM]T – number of bisections in subsequent iterations.
The algorithm flow is as follows:
1. Set i = 1;
2. Find initial approximations of the candidate Pareto designs by performing bisections xc.i.k = [xc.i–1.k +
xc.i–1.k+1]/2, k = 1, …, Ki;
3. Set m = 1;
4. For each k = 1, …, Ki, evaluate 2n perturbations of the size d around xc.i.k; for each design, calculate
its Pareto ranking and select the one with the lowest value as a new xc.i.k;
5. Set m = m +1; if m  mi go to 4;
6. Concatenate sets {xc.i–1.k}k = 1, …, Ki–1 and {xc.i.k}k = 1, …, Ki as follows {xc.i–1.1 xc.i.1 xc.i–1.2 xc.i.2 xc.i–1.3 … xc.i–
1.Ki–1 xc.i.Ki} and re-index designs accordingly;
7. Set i = i + 1; if i  M go to 2; otherwise return the Pareto set (denoted as xc(k), k = 1, …, NM);
Conceptual illustration of PRBA is shown in Fig. 1. The algorithm generates the initial (low-fidelity)
Pareto set composed of NM = 2M + 1 designs. Note that the poll-search involving Pareto ranking allows
for local improvements (in multi-objective sense) of the candidate designs obtained through bisections.
The initial Pareto front representation is further refined to the high-fidelity model level using local
approximation models (cf. Section 2.3).
As mentioned before, the perturbation size vector d is a user-defined parameter. Here, it is given as
d = |x1*– x2*|/NM, with NM being the number of Pareto-optimal designs. Such a formulation ensures that
the perturbation size in each dimension is constant and corresponds to the distance between the two
neighboring Pareto designs found by PRBA.
The numerical cost of PRBA is M(2n + 1) – M, where M = k = 1,…,M mk. Thus, for n = 15, M = 3
(which corresponds to a 9-element Pareto set), and m = [3 2 1], PRBA requires 183 model evaluations
to find the low-fidelity Pareto front representation. Note that mk gradually decreases because the
expected relocations of designs due to Step 4 of the algorithm are getting smaller. The reason is that
||xc.i–1.k – xc.i–1.k+1|| is approximately twice smaller in each iteration.

2.3 Pareto-Set Refinement Using Local Surrogates
The algorithm of Section 2.2 identifies Pareto set and the low-fidelity model level Rc. The highfidelity Pareto set is identified by refining the designs xc(k), k = 1, …, NM, using the output space mapping
(OSM) algorithm (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013). The refinement procedure is formulated as

The process (2) aims at improving the first objective without degrading the second one. The initial
approximation of the optimal design for the refinement process is xf(k) = xc(k). Typically, up to two
iterations of the correction procedure are sufficient for convergence. It should be noted that the
correction term Rs(x) + [Rf(xf(k)) – Rs(xf(k))] ensures zero-order consistency, i.e., Rs(xf(k)) = Rf(xf(k)) at the
beginning of each iteration. The utilized surrogate model is a second-order polynomial constructed from
the low-fidelity model evaluations at xc(k) and star-distributed perturbations around it (with perturbation
size set to d). The computational cost of the refinement process corresponds to 2n + 1 simulations of the
low-fidelity model (for construction of the local approximation model) and only one evaluation of the
high-fidelity per iteration (for OSM correction of the surrogate).

3 Design Example
This section provides numerical validation of the considered Pareto ranking bisection algorithm. The
considered design example is a 17-variable uniplanar antenna operating in ultra-wideband frequency
range. Discussion of the computational cost of the algorithm and its comparisons to the benchmark
methods are also provided.

3.1 Structure Description
Consider the compact uniplanar antenna shown in Fig. 2 (Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2016d). It
consists of a fork-shaped driven element fed through a coplanar waveguide (CPW) and an open ground
plane slot with tetragon-shaped planes allocated at both upper corners of the structure. The antenna is
implemented on a 0.762 mm thick Taconic RF-35 dielectric substrate (εr = 3.5, tanδ = 0.0018). It is
described by a 17-variable vector: x = [l0 l1 l3r l4r l5r lf1 lf2 lf3r lsr w1 wf1 wf2 wf3 wg wsr ws1r g]T. Parameters
w0 = 3.5 and s0 = 0.16 remain fixed to ensure 50 ohm input impedance of the CPW feed. Relative
dimensions are: l3 = (0.5w0 + s + w1)l3r, l4 = (l1 – g – lf1 – lf2)l4r, lf3 = (0.5lf2 – wf1)lf3r, ls = (w1 – wg)lsr, ws
= (w1 – wg)wsr, l22 = max{(l1 – g – lf1 – lf2)l5r, (0.5w0 + s0 + w1)l5r}, and ws1 = l0ws1r. All dimensions are
in mm.
The high-fidelity EM model Rf of the antenna (~3,200,000 hexahedral mesh cells, average simulation
time: 20 min) and the low-fidelity EM model Rc (~650,000 mesh cells, simulation time: 230 s) are both
implemented in CST Microwave Studio and simulated using its time domain solver (CST, 2013). For
the sake of reliable simulation results, both models include the SMA connector.
The design objectives are: F1 – minimization of the antenna reflection within 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz
frequency band, and F2 – reduction of antenna size defined as a A × B rectangle with A = 2(s0 + w1) +
w0 and B = l0 + l1 (cf. Fig. 2). The antenna topology is consistent within the following lower and upper
bounds: l = [4 13 0.2 0.25 0.1 4 8 0.2 0 5 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0 0.1]T and u = [14 25 0.9 0.85 0.8 11 16
0.8 0.45 15 2.5 2 2.5 1.5 0.45 0.45 2]T.

3.2 Results and Discussion
In the first step of the design process, the extreme Pareto designs x1* = [4.94 15.75 0.74 0.84 0.67
9.15 15.93 0.22 0 8.15 2.35 0.21 0.44 0.64 0.16 0.02 0.16] T and x2* = [4 13.38 0.9 0.85 0.77 8.59 13.25
0.2 0.04 5.57 2.02 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.14 0.45 0.1] T have been obtained using (1). Then, multi-objective
optimization of the antenna has been performed using PRBA (setup: M = 3, m = [3 2 1]). Finally, the
initial Pareto set has been refined using algorithm of Section 2.3. Comparison of the low- and the highfidelity trade-off designs is shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that the high-fidelity Pareto set ranges
along F1 from –13.3 dB to –9.9 dB. Moreover, the extreme Pareto design obtianed w.r.t. F1 is dominated.
Detailed dimensions of the selected antenna designs are gathered in Table 1, whereas their
corresponding reflection characteristics are shown in Fig. 4.

The computational cost of the design process corresponds to 207 Rf model simulations (69 hours of
CPU-time). The cost includes: 473 Rc and 207 Rc model simulations for identification of the extreme
Pareto designs and PRBA-based optimization, respectively, as well as 245 Rc and 30 Rf model
evaluations for refinement of the initial Pareto set.

3.3 Comparisons with Benchmark Algorithms
PRBA has been compared to surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (SAMOEA;
Koziel et al. 2014b), sequential domain patching (SDP) algorithm (Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2016b),
and Pareto front exploration (PFE) algorithm (Koziel and Bekasiewicz, 2016c) in terms of the
computational cost and the quality of the obtained Pareto set. It should be noted that the comparisons
have been performed only at the low fidelity model level. The correction process has been neglected as
it affects the shape of the final representation of the Pareto front (see e.g., Fig. 3) and its cost is the same
for all considered methods.
The SAMOEA-based optimization involves construction of the approximation model that is
optimized by the metaheuristic algorithm. The model error constructed in search space defined by
extreme designs obtained using method of Section 3.2 is 12% (2000 training samples) which makes it
inappropriate for optimization. Therefore, model with acceptable an error of 3% (902 training samples)
has been re-set in the region restricted using rotational space reduction method (Koziel and Bekasiewicz,
2016a).
The computational cost of multi-objective optimization by SAMOEA (setup: population size 500,
number of iterations 50), SDP (setup: maximum number of intervals 16), PFE (setup: size threshold 20
mm2) and PRBA is 1375, 1116, 825, and 680, respectively. The detailed cost breakdown is provided in
Table 2. PRBA operation involves 17% less CPU-time compared to PFE. Moreover, the cost of the
algorithm is almost 39% and over 50% lower compared to SDP and SAMOEA, respectively. Note that
the cost of identifying the extreme designs for PFE is lower than for remaining methods, because it
requires only one extreme point (here obtained with respect to minimum in-band reflection).
The comparison of low-fidelity Pareto sets obtained using considered algorithms is shown in Fig. 5.
The discrepancy between the obtained designs along F1 is below 1.5 dB, which is negligible from the
practical point of view. Discontinuities of the set found using SAMOEA are a result of a narrow search
space obtained using the rotational technique. As a consequence, part of the Pareto designs is allocated
outside the approximation model and hence they cannot be identified. Notwithstanding, the results are
in acceptable agreement. For the considered design structure, the PRBA not only features the lowest
computational cost among compared algorithms but also if provides comparable approximation of the
Pareto front.

4 Conclusions
In the paper, a Pareto ranking bisection algorithm has been utilized for rapid multi-objective
optimization of a 17-parameter uniplanar UWB antenna structure. As demonstrated, a nine-element
representation of the high-fidelity Pareto front has been obtained at a cost corresponding to only 207

simulations of the EM antenna model. The computational cost of the procedure (excluding the CPUtime required for the refinement of the initial Pareto set) is up to 50 percent lower compared to the stateof-the-art surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithms while providing similar accuracy.
The obtained numerical results prove usefulness of the Pareto ranking bisection algorithm for
optimization of many-parameter antennas. Our further work will focus on implementation of the method
for optimization of other numerically demanding microwave and antenna structures with many
adjustable parameters.
