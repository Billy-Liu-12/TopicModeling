Abstract. The evaluation and management of sensor uncertainty is particularly
necessary in a noisy multi-sensor context. In this paper, focusing on the
potential of distributed coordination among sensor nodes based on the built-in
association between wireless sensor networks and multi-agent systems,
meanwhile in a rough set technique sense of uncertainty, we show how an
adaptive distributed coordination framework for a hierarchy of sensor data
uncertainty performs local data fusion to increase the certainty of real-time
sensor readings coherently, makes global rational decisions under imprecision
and partial truth, and reconciles the conflicts somewhat, thus evolving adaptive
and robust sensor uncertainty handling systems. Implementation results for an
example sensor field demonstrate the application of our proposed approach.
Keywords: adaptive distributed coordination strategy, rough set theory, multiagent systems, modeling sensor uncertainty, wireless sensor networks.

1 Introduction
Generally, an explicit definition of uncertainty may refer to the idea of an information
gap between what we do know and what we need to know [1]. However, as a suitable
mathematical formalization of uncertainty, rough set theory can quantify both what is
known and what is unknown. Moreover, from rough set perspective, further research
is needed to view the ways in which uncertainties are hierarchical and interconnected.
Especially, so far there exists little work on incorporating coordination mechanism
into adaptive sensor uncertainty handling, for which the issue of a distributed
coordination framework is actually an important and novel research direction.

2 Background Concepts and Motivation
Rough set theory approaches the problem of inexact concepts in the form of a
decision system (U, A ∪ {d}). Here U is a non-empty finite set of objects, A is a set
of condition attributes, and d is decision element. For any subset R of A, AS = (U, R),

an ordered pair, is the approximation space [2]; [x]R denotes the equivalence class of
R containing x, for x ∈ U. The lower approximation of X is the set R X = {x| x ∈ U,
[x]R

⊆ X} and the upper approximation of X is the set

R X = {x| x ∈ U, [x]R ∩X≠Ø}.

The results in R X are certain. The boundary region R X - R X contains those
uncertainty results that are possible, but not certain.
Multi-agent systems are fundamentally designed for dealing with and offering
architecture for complex distributed applications that require collaborative problem
solving, and wireless sensor networks consist of a collection of light-weight sensors
connected via wireless links to each other or to a more powerful gateway node [3].
While principles taken from the rough set theory are suitably employed for the
mathematical modeling and further handling of sensor uncertainty through the use of
its approximation space, the need for cooperative processing of spatially and
temporally dense collected data because of limited resources, makes multi-agent
system architecture an ideal candidate for analyzing and modeling distributed sensor
data, and these ideas are the motivation behind this approach.

3 Modeling of Sensor Uncertainty
Herein, we identify uncertainty as a measure of the level of confidence of a sensed
value, or of validity of a conclusion at a higher level. Due to hardware limitations and
signal processing inaccuracies, there are always some forms of uncertainty associated
with sensor measurement and the processed information. First, some uncertainties can
only be inferred as the absence or incompleteness of certain observational data item
values because of inaccessibility. And second, uncertainty can be seen as a scaling of
the noise level of inconsistent data sets, also in the form of the binary data
inconsistency failures during the actual sensor processing. Additionally, a sensor node
usually faces uncertainties owing to its limited or outdated partial information about
the states of complex problem solving in other nodes. Furthermore, there exists the
uncertainty which arises from the issue of granularity effect. All these form a
hierarchy of sensor data uncertainty.

4 Adaptive Distributed Sensor Uncertainty Coordination Frame
In order to effectively handle sensor uncertainty, as shown in Figure 1, we may use
the term “agent” to mean any sensor node, and there are three kinds of hierarchically
dispersed agents embedded on sensors, i.e. sensor agents, cluster agents, and the
manager agent, which form a wireless sensor network into a distributed multi-agent
sensor system. Furthermore, as coordination is the process of effectively managing
interdependencies between activities distributed across agents [4], we propose a
hierarchical distributed coordination framework for sensor uncertainty handling,
which bridges the potential of adaptive coordination to reduce sensor uncertainty with
that of intelligent decision in the form of rule with an appropriate level of certainty.

Firstly, on the layer of local data fusion, the principle issue is to manage and
minimize the measured sensor agent uncertainties through suitable fusion algorithms.
On the one hand, redundant data fusion can increase the accuracy and certainty of
sensed data in the case of sensor failure. On the other hand, complementary data
fusion allows features to be sensed coherently through fusing the different types of
data from more than one source sensors to synthesize meaningful information.
Secondly, on the layer of attribute reduction and decision rule, the major topics
consist in the fact that one must not only be aware of sensor uncertainty, but also
discover hidden concise relationships that agree with uncertain sensor situations. At
the cluster agents, by employing the notion of reduction in a rough set sense, which is
the minimal set of condition attributes that eliminates pairwise dependencies and
makes the same decisions as the whole set, those redundant condition attributes along
with their associated uncertainties may be removed, then the reduction of the number
of attributes and further the discovery of deterministic decision rules are achieved,
thus providing an appropriate model for the distributed multi-agent sensor system.
Thirdly, on the layer of global conflict resolution at the manager agent, problem of
conflict resolution is of most importance due to exclusive interpretations of the same
thing or conflicting sets of rules from different source sensors. In rough set approach,
inconsistency is represented by the concepts of lower and upper approximation, and
confliction relation is expressed by the notion of boundary region, which may be of
minimal level of uncertainty by forcing a finer granulation of the partitioning.
Moreover, through the use of explicit rule priorities, we can reconcile the consistency
degrees about the inferences under uncertainty as far as possible.

5 Case Study: Example Implementation Results
In this section we illustrate the above presented ideas by a distributed multi-sensor
paradigm for real-time forest fire detection. Herein, the sensor data can be represented
as a decision table, which is constitutive of condition attributes {temperature, relative
humidity, rainfall, smoke, wind speed} and decision attribute {fire level}.
Here we discuss some primary kinds of hierarchical sensor uncertainty at the
cluster agents and the manager agent. A schedule of these uncertainties and the
corresponding example implementation results are listed in Table 1 and Table 2,
respectively. While raw uncertainty sensor data from distributed sensor agents and
cluster agents have been converted into the minimal efficient sets of certain condition
attribute data and deterministic decision rules at the manager agent, these demonstrate
the efficiency of the adaptive distributed sensor uncertainty coordinate framework.

6 Conclusions
Considering there is some room for a mixture of approaches for the sensor uncertainty
problem based on rough set theory and multi-agent system, we have proposed and
demonstrated an adaptive distributed coordination frame reflecting the handling of
multiple levels of sensor uncertainty, along with emphasis on how to make a complex
multi-agent sensor system self-repairing and behave deterministically to some extent.
