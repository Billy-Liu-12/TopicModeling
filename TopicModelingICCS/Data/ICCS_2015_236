Abstract
This paper proposes a new enhanced velocity method to directly construct a ﬂux-continuous
velocity approximation with multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element method on subdomains. This
gives an eﬃcient way to perform simulations on multiblock domains with non-matching hexahedral grids. We develop a reasonable assumption on geometry, discuss implementation issues,
and give several numerical results with slightly compressible single phase ﬂow.
Keywords: multipoint ﬂux, mixed ﬁnite element, non-matching grid, hexahedral grid

Introduction

The enhanced velocity method [11] was introduced as a way to directly construct a strongly
ﬂux-continuous velocity approximation for mixed ﬁnite element methods on multiblock grids.
These grids are logically rectangular on non-overlapping subdomains, and are non-matching on
subdomain interfaces. The method was originally formulated assuming non-matching Cartesian
grids and using a cell-centered ﬁnite-diﬀerence method, which is equivalent to the lowest order
Raviart-Thomas (RT0) mixed method with special quadrature [3]. The enhanced velocity
technique has proven to be a relatively inexpensive method for local mesh reﬁnement, and also
a valuable simulation tool for ﬂow in porous media [10, 5]. It is an alternative to the multiscale
mortar mixed ﬁnite element method [2], which introduces extra pressure unknowns on a special
interface grid and enforces weakly the ﬂux continuity with additional equations, see Figure 1.
The enhanced velocity approach is faster than the mortar method with interface solver [11],
but recent development in more eﬃcient algorithms [7] have now made them comparable.
Recently multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element (MFMFE) methods have been developed to
give cell-centered ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes on more general geometries such as quadrilaterals and

simplices [14] and distorted hexahedra [8]. The MFMFE method is based on the lowest order
Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM1) spaces for simplices and quadrilaterals and an enhancement
of the Brezzi-Douglas-Duran-Fortin (BDDF1) spaces for hexahedra. These spaces have one
normal velocity degree of freedom per vertex on each edge (face in 3D). Special trapezoidaltype quadrature rules are employed to eliminate locally the velocities, resulting in a cell-centered
pressure system. These techniques are ﬁnite element interpretations of the multipoint ﬂux
approximation (MPFA) methods [1, 6] from the ﬁnite volume community. The MFMFE method
has been used in a multiblock setting with the multiscale mortar method [13].
This work describes a novel way to combine the enhanced velocity method with the multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element method in order to allow simulations on multiblock domains
with non-matching distorted hexahedral grids. In Figure 2 we illustrate the degrees of freedom
in this approach. Note that the enhanced velocity approach gives a two ﬂux approximation
(TPFA) on the non-matching interface, while a more accurate method based on the local ﬂux
mimetic ﬁnite diﬀerence approach [9] could be formulated using a multipoint ﬂux approximation (MPFA). We demonstrate a proof of concept of the former in this work, while the latter
will be investigated in a future work.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we outline the method, in Section 3 we
discuss implementation issues, in Section 4 we give a veriﬁcation test, in Section 5 we give a
realistic example, and in Section 6 we conclude.

discretization of (2a)–(2b). We assume that each subdomain Ωi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, can be approximately partitioned by a union of non-overlapping quadrilateral or hexahedral elements denoted
by Th,i . We assume that the diﬀerence between Ωi and its ﬁnite element partition is of suﬃciently small area (volume) to be neglected. The subdomain partitions Th,i and Th,j need not
match on Γi,j . Let Th = ∪ni=1 Th,i . The ﬁnite element spaces are deﬁned on the reference square

The normal velocity components are linear (bilinear in 3D) on each edge (face) resulting in two
(four) velocity degrees of freedom per edge (face), with one degree of freedom associated with
each vertex.
The enhanced velocity method along Γ is based on the RT0 spaces

be the BDM1 or BDDF1 velocity space on Ωi . The product space
Vh = Vh,1 ⊕ Vh,2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vh,n
however is not a subspace of H(div; Ω) since the normal vector components do not match on
Γ. We thus need to modify the degrees of freedom on Γ. We make the following assumption.
Assumption 2.1. There exists a continuous global map from a multiblock Cartesian reference
ˆ = ∪n Ω
ˆ
domain Ω
i=1 i to the physical domain Ω.
This assumption guarantees that the physical interfaces are comprised of structured nonplanar quadrilaterals. In particular, assume that Th,i is the map of a rectangular partition Tˆh,i
ˆ i . Let Tˆh,i,j be the rectangular partition of Γ
ˆ i,j obtained from the intersection of the traces
of Ω
ˆ
ˆ
of Th,i and Th,j . We force the ﬂuxes to match on each element eˆ ∈ Th,i,j . Consider any element
ˆ i,j = ∅. The interface grid may divide the boundary edge (face) of
E ∈ Tˆh,i such that E ∩ Γ
E into several parts. This division can be extended inside the element as shown in Figure 2.
On each sub-element Ek we deﬁne a basis function vEk in the RT0 space VhRT (Ek ) which has
a normal component vEk · n equal to one on ek and zero on the other edges (faces). Let VhΓ
be the span of all such basis functions, after mapping to the physical domain Ω via the Piola
transformation. We deﬁne the multiblock mixed ﬁnite element velocity space to be
0
0
0
Vh∗ = (Vh,1
⊕ Vh,2
· · · ⊕ Vh,n
⊕ VhΓ ) ∩ H(div; Ω),
0
where Vh,i
is the subspace of Vh,i with zero normal trace on Γi . Following [11] we call Vh∗ an
enhanced velocity space. The addition of the interface degrees of freedom allows for imposing
ﬂux continuity on the ﬁner interface grid ThΓ = ∪1≤i≤j Th,i,j and thus constructing an H(div; Ω)
- conforming velocity approximation. We note that this deﬁnition modiﬁes the usual BDM1
(BDDF1) velocity space an all elements neighboring Γ.
With the above deﬁned spaces we have the following mixed ﬁnite element discretization of
(2a)-(2b): ﬁnd uh ∈ Vh∗ and ph ∈ Wh such that

(K −1 uh , v)Q∗ = (ph , ∇ · v),
(∇ · uh , w) = (f, w),

v ∈ Vh∗ ,

where (K −1 q, v)Q∗ is a trapezoidal-type quadrature rule. More precisely, letting q = q0 + qΓ ,
v = v0 + vΓ , then
(K −1 q, v)Q∗ = (K −1 q0 , v0 )Q + (KΓ−1 qΓ , v0 )Q + (KΓ−1 q0 , vΓ )Q + (KΓ−1 qΓ , vΓ )Q ,

(4)

where (·, ·)Q is the element-wise trapezoidal quadrature rule applied after mapping to the reference element and KΓ = nTΓ KnΓ is the component of K|Γ along nΓ , the unit normal vector
on Γ. We choose the degrees of freedom of Vh on an edge (face) e to be the normal components of the vector on e evaluated at the vertices of e. With this choice, the quadrature rule
(K −1 u0h , v0 )Q results in a block-diagonal matrix with blocks formed by the coupling of the
velocity degrees of freedom associated with each vertex of the mesh. It is therefore easy to
eliminate the velocities u0h in terms of the cell centered pressures in the neighboring elements.
We refer to [14, 8] for details. We note that a non-symmetric version of the quadrature rule can
be employed, which results in a method that converges on general quadrilaterals or hexahedra,
see [12]. Furthermore, since KΓ is a scalar and q0 · n = 0 on Γ,
(KΓ−1 uΓh , v0 )Q = (KΓ−1 u0h , vΓ )Q = 0,
resulting in no interaction between the degrees of freedom of Vh0 and VhΓ . Finally, (KΓ−1 uΓh , vΓ )Q
is applied on each sub-element Ek . Since uΓh · n is constant on each sub-edge (sub-face) ek , the
resulting mass matrix is diagonal and each velocity degree of freedom in VhΓ , can be expressed
as a pressure diﬀerence, see next section for details. Combining the above, all velocity degrees
of freedom can be eliminated, resulting in a cell-centered system for the piecewise constant
pressures.

Implementation

In the original implementation of the enhanced velocity method with Cartesian grids and RT0
elements [11], the subdomain elements are bricks with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and
the sub-faces on the non-matching interfaces are rectangular. Our goal in this work is to reuse
as much of the original enhanced velocity implementation as possible, and to generalize it to
handle logically rectangular distorted hexahedral grids in a straightforward and simple manner.
The application of the quadrature rule in the term (K −1 u0h , v0 )Q allows one to express a
sub-face interface ﬂux as q = −T C(p1 − p2 ), where the transmissibility is given by
TC =

2 ∗ AREA
,
x1
x2
+
M1 M2

(5)

where AREA is the area of the sub-face, x1 and x2 are half mesh widths, M 1 and M 2 are
permeability components normal to the orientation of the sub-face, and p1 and p2 are the
pressures in the elements that share the sub-face. Note that in the original enhanced velocity
method, the physical grid coincides with the reference grid. This is no longer the case when
using the multipoint ﬂux mixed ﬁnite element method on hexahedra on the subdomains.
We therefore propose the transmissibility modiﬁcation as outlined in Figure 3. In Step
1, the original enhanced velocity routines are used for ﬁnding the intersection grid in the
reference domain. In Step 2, Assumption 2.1 allows the mapping of these reference sub-faces
to form nonplanar quadrilaterals instead of general polygons. In Step 3, the terms in equation
(5) are modiﬁed according to the physical grid. In particular, AREA(eij ) ≈
AREA(Tk ),
n(Tk )/4, x1 = 2 ∗ dist(a, c), x2 = 2 ∗ dist(b, c), M 1 = nT Ki n, and M 2 = nT Kj n.

where φ is the porosity, ρ(p) = ρref ecp is the ﬂuid density, μ is viscosity, and g is gravitational

system of type (3a)–(3b) is solved.
The purpose of this example is to verify that the proposed transmissibility modiﬁcations
from the previous section produce a reasonable result. We purposefully create a worst case
scenario in 2D where both the permeability and the orientation of the interface are adversely
rotated in the physical grid as shown in Figure 4 to exacerbate the problem with the original
transmissibility formula. This situation could be motivated by the deposition of an ancient
riverbed where oftentimes permeability follows the geometry. Following the notation in the
ﬁgure, the parameters for domain size are R1 = 5, R2 = 10, and L = π(R1 + R2 )/2 ≈ 23.5619.

This is a steady state problem run in dimensionless units with compressibility c = 0, porosity

boundary conditions are imposed such that p = 1 at {x = 0} and p = 0 at {x = R1 +R2 } on the
physical grid, and no ﬂow u·n = 0 elsewhere. Figure 5 shows the simulation results. A reference
solution was ﬁrst generated on a single domain with a 20 × 10 grid for comparison, and two
multiblock simulations are performed. The ﬁrst uses the original transmissibility formula from
the RT0 enhanced velocity implementation, i.e. formula (5) on the reference grid. The second
uses the modiﬁed transmissibility formula as described in Section 3. While all three methods
are strongly mass conservative, one can observe that the modiﬁed transmissibility case closely
matches the single domain case while the original transmissibility case severely underestimates
the ﬂux through the interface.

Reservoir Geometry Example

The purpose of this example is to present a realistic test case of the method. The domain in this
example is a synthetic reservoir geometry. The reference domain Ω1 = (0, 10)×(0, 100)×(0, 100)
is discretized into 9 × 9 × 9 elements, and Ω2 = (4, 12) × (100, 180) × (0, 80) is discretized into

Conclusions

The results given in this paper summarize the work done to create the ﬁrst examples of ﬂow in
porous media simulations with multiblock non-matching distorted hexahedral domains without
the need for mortar ﬁnite elements. This proof of concept demonstrates the usefulness of the
method, and further papers are planned to analyze convergence rates and draw comparisons
with the local ﬂux mimetic ﬁnite diﬀerence method [9] on the same types of domains.
