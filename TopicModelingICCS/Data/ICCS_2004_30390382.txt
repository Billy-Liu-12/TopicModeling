Abstract. The generalized H´enon–Heiles system with an additional
nonpolynomial term has been considered. In two nonintegrable cases
with the help of the Painlev´e test new special solutions have been found
as converging Laurent series, depending on three parameters. For some
values of these parameters the obtained Laurent series coincide with the
Laurent series of the known elliptic solutions. The calculations have been
made with use of computer algebra system REDUCE. The obtained local
solutions can assist to ﬁnd the elliptic three parameters solutions. The
corresponding algorithm has been realized in REDUCE and Maple.

The Painlev´
e Test

When we study some mechanical problem time is assumed to be real, whereas the
integrability of motion equations is connected with the behavior of their solutions
as functions of complex time. Solutions of a system of ODE’s are regarded as
analytic functions, maybe with isolated singular points. A singular point of a
solution is said critical (as opposed to noncritical) if the solution is multivalued
(single-valued) in its neighborhood and movable if its location depends on initial
conditions. The general solution of an ODE of order N is the set of all solutions
mentioned in the existence theorem of Cauchy, i.e. determined by the initial
values. It depends on N arbitrary independent constants. A special solution is
any solution obtained from the general solution by giving values to the arbitrary
constants. A singular solution is any solution which is not special, i.e. which
does not belong to the general solution. A system of ODE’s has the Painlev´
e
property if its general solution has no movable critical singularity point [1].
The Painlev´
e test is any algorithm, which checks some necessary conditions for a diﬀerential equation to have the Painlev´e property. The original
algorithm, developed by P. Painlev´e and used by him to ﬁnd all the second order ODE’s with Painlev´e property, is known as the α-method. The method of
S.V. Kovalevskaya [2] is not as general as the α–method, but much more simple.
The remarkable property of this test is that it can be checked in a ﬁnite number
of steps. In 1980, motivated by the work of S.V. Kovalevskaya [2], M.J. Ablowitz, A. Ramani and H. Segur [3] developed a new algorithm of the Painlev´e
test for ODE’s. This algorithm appears very useful to ﬁnd solutions as a formal

Laurent series. First of all, it allows to determine the dominant behavior of a
solution in the neighborhood of the singularity point t0 . If the solution tends
to inﬁnity as (t − t0 )β , where β is a negative integer number, then substituting
the Laurent series expansions one can transform nonlinear diﬀerential equations
into a system of linear algebraic equations on coeﬃcients of the Laurent series.
If a single-valued solution of autonomous system depends on not only the parameter t0 , which characterizes the syngularity point location, but also on other
parameters, then some coeﬃcients of its Laurent series have to be arbitrary and
the corresponding systems have to have zero determinants. The numbers of such
systems (named resonances or Kovalevskaya exponents) can be determined due
to the Painlev´e test. In such a way we obtain solutions only as formal series,
but for some nonintegrable systems, for example, the generalized H´enon–Heiles
system [4], the convergence of the Laurent- and psi-series solutions has been
proved. Such solutions also assist to ﬁnd the elliptic solutions [5].

The H´
enon–Heiles Hamiltonian

Let us consider the generalized H´enon–Heiles system with an additional nonpolynomial term, which is described by the Hamiltonian:
H=

C
µ
1 2
x + yt2 + λx2 + y 2 + x2 y − y 3 + 2

and the corresponding system of the motion equations:
µ

ytt = − y − x2 + Cy 2 ,
xtt = − λx − 2xy +

(2)

where xtt ≡ ddt2x and ytt ≡ ddt2y , λ, µ and C are arbitrary numerical parameters.
If C = 1, λ = 1 and µ = 0, then (1) is the initial H´enon–Heiles Hamiltonian [6].
The general solutions in the analytic form are known [7] only in the three
integrable cases C = −1 and λ = 1; C = −6 and λ is an arbitrary number;
C = −16 and λ = 1/16 , in other cases not only four-, but even three-parameter
exact solutions have yet to be found.
In all above-mentioned cases system (2) is integrable at any value of µ. Moreover the function y, solution of system (2), satisﬁes the following fourth-order
equation, which does not include µ:
20C 3
y + (4Cλ − 6)y 2 − 4λy − 4H,
3
(3)
where H is the energy of the system. If x0 = Cy02 − y0 − y0tt = 0, then H is not
an arbitrary parameter, but a function of initial data: y0 , y0t , y0tt and y0ttt . The
form of this function depends on µ.
The Painlev´e test of eq. (3) gives the following dominant behaviors and resonance structures:

ytttt = (2C − 8)ytt y − (4λ + 1)ytt + 2(C + 1)yt2 +

1. The function y tends to inﬁnity as b−2 (t − t0 )−2 , where b−2 = −3 or
b−2 = C6 .
2. For b−2 = −3 (the Case 1) the values of resonances are r = −1, 10, (5 ±
1 − 24(1 + C))/2. In the Case 2 (b−2 = C6 ) r = −1, 5, 5 ± 1 − 48/C.
The resonance r = −1 corresponds to arbitrary parameter t0 . Other values
of r determine powers of t (their values are r − 2), at which new arbitrary
parameters can appear as solutions of the linear systems with zero determinant.
For integrability of system (2) all values of r have to be integer and all systems
with zero determinants have to have solutions at any values of included in them
free parameters. It is possible only in the integrable cases.
For the search for special solutions, it is interesting to consider such values
of C, for which r are integer numbers either only in Case 1 or only in Case
2. If there exist a negative integer resonance, diﬀerent from r = −1, then such
Laurent series expansion corresponds rather to special than general solution.
We demand that all values of r, but one, are nonnegative integer numbers and
all these values are diﬀerent. From these conditions we obtain the following
values of C: C = −1 and C = −4/3 (Case 1), or C = −16/5, C = −6 and
√
1− 1−48/C
C = −16 (Case 2, α =
), and also C = −2, in which these two Cases
2
coincide. It has been shown in [8] (for µ = 0) and [9] (for an arbitrary value
of µ) that single-valued three-parameter special solutions can exist only in two
nonintegrable cases: C = −16/5 and C = −4/3 (λ is arbitrary).
Using the method of construction of the Laurent series solutions for nonlinear
diﬀerential equations describing in [8], we obtain single-valued local solutions of
eq. (3). At C = −4/3 these solutions are:

The parameters b2 and b8 , coeﬃcients at t2 and t8 correspondingly, are arbitrary.

The coeﬃcients ˜b3 and ˜b8 are arbitrary parameters. Beginning from ˜b4 some
coeﬃcients include the energy H. So, the obtained local solutions depend on

four independent parameters: t0 , H and two coeﬃcients (b2 and b8 or ˜b3 and ˜b8 ).
With the help of some computer algebra system, for example, REDUCE [12],
these solutions can be obtained with arbitrary accuracy. When a formal series is
obtained the question about its convergence arises. The convergence of psi-series
solutions of the generalized H´enon–Heiles system with µ = 0 on some real time
interval has been proved in [4].

Global Single-Valued Solutions

We have found local single-valued solutions. Of course, existence of local singlevalued solutions is necessary, but not suﬃcient condition to exist global ones,
because solutions, which are single-valued in the neighborhood of one singularity
point, can be multivalued in the neighborhood of another singularity point. So,
we can only assume that global three-parameter solutions are single-valued. If
we assume this and moreover that these solutions are elliptic functions (or some
degenerations of them), then we can seek them as solutions of some polynomial
ﬁrst order equations. There are a few methods to construct such solutions, representing them as the ﬁnite Taylor or Laurent series of elliptic functions or
degenerate elliptic functions, for example, tanh(t). These methods use results of
the Painlev´e test, but don’t use the obtained Laurent-series solutions. In 2003
R. Conte and M. Musette [5] have proposed the method, which uses such solutions.
The classical theorem, which was established by Briot and Bouquet [10],
proves that if the general solution of a polynomial autonomous ﬁrst order ODE
is single-valued, then this solution is either an elliptic function, or a rational
function of eγx , γ being some constant, or a rational function of x. Note that the
third case is a degeneracy of the second one, which in its turn is a degeneracy of
the ﬁrst one. It has been proved by Painlev´e [1] that the necessary form of the
polynomial autonomous ﬁrst order ODE with the single-valued general solution
is
m 2m−2k

hjk y j ytk = 0,
k=0

h0m = 1,

(6)

j=0

in which m is a positive integer number and hjk are constants.
Rather than to substitute eq. (6) in some nonintegrable system, one can
substitute the Laurent series of unknown special solutions in eq. (6) and obtain
a system, which is linear in hjk and nonlinear in parameters which are included
in the Laurent coeﬃcients.
Let us compare two methods to ﬁnd special analytic solutions for the generalized H´enon–Heiles system.
The ﬁrst way is the following:
1) Transform system (2) into eq. (3)
2) Assume that y satisﬁes some more simple equation, substitute this equation in (3) and obtain a nonlinear algebraic system.
3) Solve the obtained system.

386

S.Y. Vernov

The second, proposed by R. Conte and M. Musette, way is the following:
1) Choose a positive integer m and deﬁne the ﬁrst order ODE (6), which
contains unknown constants hjk .
2) Compute coeﬃcients of the Laurent series solutions for (2) with some ﬁxed
C. The number of coeﬃcients has to be greater than the number of unknowns.
3) Substituting the obtained coeﬃcients, transform eq. (8) in linear and overdetermined system in hjk with coeﬃcients depending on arbitrary parameters.
4) Exclude hjk and obtain the nonlinear system in ﬁve parameters.
5) Solve the obtained system.
To obtain the explicit form of the elliptic function, which satisfy the known
ﬁrst order ODE, one can use the classical method due to Poincar´e, which has
been implemented [11] in Maple [13].
The second way has a few preferences and can be automatized. The ﬁrst
preference is that one does not need to transform system (2) in one diﬀerential
equation either in y or in x. Moreover at C = −16/5 not x, but x2 may be an
elliptic function. To construct the Laurent series for x2 is easier than to ﬁnd
the fourth order equation in x2 . The main preference of the second method is
that the number of unknowns in the resulting algebraic system does not depend
on number of coeﬃcients of the ﬁrst order equation. For example, eq. (6) with
m = 8 includes 60 unknowns hjk , and it is not possible use the ﬁrst way to ﬁnd
similar solutions. Using the second method we obtain nonlinear system in ﬁve
variables: λ1 , λ2 , H and two arbitrary coeﬃcients of the Laurent-series solutions
independently of the value of m.
The ﬁrst way also has one important preference. It allows to obtain solutions
for an arbitrary C, whereas using the second method one has to ﬁx value of
C to construct the Laurent series solutions, because of the resonance structure
depends on C. Using the ﬁrst way one can also construct equations, which forms
are diﬀerent from (6). For example, the substitution of the eqution
˜ − P0 )3 + B(y
˜ − P0 )5/2 + C(y
˜ − P0 )2 + D(y
˜ − P0 )3/2 + E(y
˜ − P0 ) (7)
yt2 = A(y
gives two-parameter solutions [9]:
y(t − t0 ) =

a℘(t − t0 ) + b
c℘(t − t0 ) + d

2

+ P0 ,

(8)

where ℘(t − t0 ) is the Weierstrass elliptic function, a, b, c and d are some constants. The parameter P0 deﬁnes the energy of the system. Solutions (8) exist
in both above-mentioned nonintegrable cases: C = −16/5 and C = −4/3. There
exist two diﬀerent solutions for each pair of values of C and λ. To ﬁnd these solutions we a priori assume some class of possible solutions, then compute whether
there exists some solution in the given class. We hope that the use of the second method and the corresponding computer algebra program allows to ﬁnd
the three-parameter elliptic solutions without any preliminary assumption. This
method is implemented both in REDUCE and in Maple.

Conclusion

We have found the special solutions of the H´enon–Heiles system with C = −16/5
and C = −4/3 as the Laurent series. For some values of parameters the obtained
solutions coincide with the known exact periodic solutions. The Painlev´e test
does not show any obstacle to the existence of three-parameter single-valued
solutions, so, the probability to ﬁnd exact, for example elliptic, three-parameter
solutions, that generalize the solutions found in [9], is high.
