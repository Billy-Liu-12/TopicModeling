Abstract. Parallel implicit solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on two fractional steps in time and Finite Element discretization in
space is presented. The accuracy of the scheme is second order in both time and
space domains. Large time step sizes, with CFL numbers much larger than
unity, are taken. The Domain Decomposition Technique is implemented for
parallel solution of the problem with matching and non-overlapping sub domains. The segragate solution to tempereature field is obtained for the flow case
where the forced convection is one order of magnitude higher than the free
convection.

Introduction

As is well known, explicit schemes impose severe restrictions on the time step size for
analyzing complex viscous flow fields, which are resolved with sufficiently fine grids.
To remedy this, implicit flow solvers are used in analyzing such flows. Accuracy of
the scheme is also a major issue in the numerical study of complex flows. Naturally,
the higher order accurate schemes allow one to resolve the flow field with less number
of grid points. Resolving the flow field with less number of points gives a great advantage to implicit schemes since the size of the matrix to be inverted becomes small.
In this study a second order accurate implicit scheme for solution of full NavierStokes equations is developed and implemented. The space is discretized with brick
elements while modified version of the two-step fractional method is used in time discretization of the momentum equation. At each time step, the momentum equation is
solved only once to get the half time step velocity field. The pressure, on the other
hand, is obtained via an auxiliary scalar potential which satisfies the Poisson's equation. For the parallel implicit solution of the matrix equations, modified version of the
Domain Decomposition Method, [1,2], is utilized, and direct inversion in each domain
is performed. Super linear speed ups were achieved [3].

The implicit formulation for the momentum equation and the parallel implementation of the momentum, the pressure and the energy equation will be given in the following sections. The parallel solutions results obtained for the forced cooling of a
room with chilled ceiling will be given at the end.
The scheme here is made to run on SGI Origin 3000 utilized with 8 processors running Unix operating system. Public version of the Parallel Virtual Machine, PVM 3.3,
is used as the communication library.

The equations are written in vector form (here on, boldface type symbols denote vector or matrix quantities). The velocity vector, pressure, temperature and time are denoted by u=u(u,v.w), p, T and t, respectively. The variables are non-dimensionalized
using a reference velocity and a characteristic length. Re is the Reynolds number,
Re = UH/ν where U is the reference velocity, H is the characteristic length and ν is
the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. Gr represents the Grashof number,
Gr = gβ∆TH 3 / ν 2 , where β is the coefficient of volumetric expansion. Pr denotes
Prandtl number and k denotes the unit vector in z direction.

field p n and φ obtained in the second step.
The above procedure is repeated until the desired time level. In all computations
lumped form of the mass matrix is used.

Domain Decomposition

The domain decomposition technique, [3,5,6,7], is modified and applied for the efficient parallel solution of the momentum, Eq. (11) and the Poisson’s Equation for the
auxiliary potential function, Eq. (13).

For the Momentum Equation

Initialization: The momentum, Eq. (11) is solved with a direct solution method, separately in each domain Ω i with boundary of ∂Ω i and interface S j , with vanishing
Neumann boundary condition on the domain interfaces,

Each slave sends its new computed interface values to the master processor at the
end of the unit problem and master starts post-processing of the received data from the
slaves. The interface iteration cycle starts up at the master processor. Master optimizes
the interface nodal values of the unknowns using the following ‘steepest descent’ procedure.
Steepest Descent: Interface iteration cycle goes on until the master processor finds
correct Neumann conditions at the interfaces, µ k , at the end of its post processing of
the interface data received from the slave processors,

then

µ n +1 = µ k

Finalization: Having obtained the correct Neumann boundary condition for each interface, the momentum equation, Eq. (11), is solved via the direct solution method at
each sub-domain, together with the correct interface conditions,

Parallel Implementation

During parallel implementation, in order to advance the solution single time step, the
momentum equation is solved implicitly with domain decomposition. Solving Eq. (11)

gives the velocity field at half time level, which is used at the right hand sides of Poisson’s Eq. (13), in obtaining the auxiliary potential. The solution of the auxiliary potential is obtained with again domain decomposition where an iterative solution is also
necessary at the interface. Therefore, the computations involving an inner iterative cycle and outer time step advancements have to be performed in a parallel manner on
each processor communicating with the neighboring one.

Results and Discussion

The flow in a room, given in Fig. 1, with a Reynolds numbers of 1000, based on 1m.
length, inflow speed and the kinematic viscosity, is studied. The computational domain has the following dimensions: sides x = 4m, y = 2m (symmetry plane) and maximum height z = 2.6m. The solution is advanced up to the dimensionless time level of
75, where the steady state is reached, with time step of 0.025. Computations are carried with the 6-domain partitioning grids with total number of 61x31x35 nodes. The
following dimensionless numbers are employed. Re = 1000, Pr = 0.7, Gr/Re2 = 0.01.
The elapsed time per time step per grid point is 0.0002 seconds.

Velocity and temperature fields at the symmetry are presented in Fig. 3. The cooling
effect of the chilled curved ceiling is obvious on the isotherm plots. The initially linear temperature field changes, because of the circulation in the room, so that the cool
front moves towards the hot wall. Shown in Fig. 4 is the isotherms at x = 2 plane
where initially temperature is zero. Because of secondary currents in the room cool
air packages are observed around the x = 2 plane.
