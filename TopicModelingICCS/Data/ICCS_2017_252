natural habitats of Natura 2000. Part Mapping and determination of conservational status of
mammals (except bats). The map is published with changes.
The main threats to the existence of the population in the country are the strong isolation
of the two meta-populations (Rila-Rhodopes habitat and Balkan Mountains habitat); strong
poaching; destruction and reduction of the habitats through urbanization in the mountains and
felling of old natural forests [15].
Until 1992 the bear had been a game target. By Order 1023 dated 31.12.1992 of the Ministry
of Environment and Water (MoEW)the species has been declared protected, in compliance with
the Nature protection act. This status has been kept also after the Biodiversity act was passed
in 2002. The Habitat directive requires strict protection of the species and declaration of
special protected areas for conservation of its habitats [20]. The main habitats of the bear
in Bulgaria are included in the ecological network NATURA 2000 [21]. For the purposes of
protection of the habitats and the management of the network NATURA 2000 a mapping
and determination of their environmental status was carried out within the frame of a project
under the EU operational programmes environment. The acquired information is used for the
elaboration of plans for managing the protected areas and the populations of the species as well
as for regulation of the investment projects therein. That is why it is important to estimate
habitat use and population dynamics of brown bears in the country. In this work we study the
population of brown bears in the Rhodope Mountains, using data received from two National
monitorings that were carried out in autumn 2011 and 2012.
In this study, we use the transect method and statistical approches [6, 7, 18, 19] to estimate
the population size of the brown bears. The transect method is based of collection of traces of
brown bears on a predefined set of routes (transects) and analysis to determine the unique traces.
It is a popular and cheap method for monitoring the bear population. National monitorings
are incomplete and contains some uncertainties. Here we suggest some approaches to resolve
this problem and obtain a satisfactory estimate of the brown bear population in The Rhodopes.
The suggested approaches can be applied to estimate the population of the species in the other
mountain massifs. The second important problem is that the data are obtained in only one
part of The Rhodopes habitat, they are incomplete and contain some uncertainties. Here we
combine statistical approches [6, 7] and extrapolation approaches to resolve this problem and

Background

Different modern methods are used globally and in Europe to estimate local numbers and
densities of bear populations (see [5, 12, 14]). At the same time the traditional method of
the measurement and identification of the footprints is widely used with success in the field
studies of carnivores, and the methods of their analysis has become more precise. The tracking
method gives very good results in the study of the ecology of large carnivores in Russia [9].
Several recent studies advocate use of footprints for individual identification ([1]). Recently, a
precise method of measurements of footprints showed that the sex of tigers could be accurately
distinguished based on their footprints (100%) ([11]). Due to the mountain regions in Bulgaria
and due to the difficult logistics that expensive methods entale, up to now in Bulgaria only the
method of the individualized bear footprints has been in use. This traditional method, as we
can see below, seems reliable enough. It requires considerable physical efforts and an expert
experience for field work but if it is implemented well it is considered efficient enough. It could
provide with enough reliable results especially if it is supplemented by the method of photo
trapping of the individuals. The collected data are considered suitable for statistical analysis
giving the chance for extrapolation of the results for larger territories ([4]).
In the mid-eighties of the 20th century the research on the number and the structure of the
bear population using sustained observations, transect method and identification of individual
animals by their footprints had been in use ([3, 13]).
Until now the identification of the footprints and the assessment of the bear population
structure based on the size of the footprints, carried out for the purposes of the National
monitoring scheme, was based on the protocol proposed by Gunchev [3] which considers the
correlation between the weight parameters of the bears established by observation and the
footprints measured on the terrain (most often the length of the posterior paw). Later on, this
method was amended incorporating the results and the analysis of the research in the Central
Balkan within the ”so-called GEF project” that provided reliable indexes for the correlation
between the size of the anterior and posterior footprint.
The explanation of how to apply it to increase the efficacy in covering large territories and
for differentiating the individuals with similar footprints is explained in [16].
In Russia the method of following the tracks and determining the number of individuals
according to their footprints has been used for decades with remarkable success in terms of
research on the ecology of different carnivores, including the bear. The comparison between
the radio-tracking method and the one based on following the tracks by walking shows that
both methods have advantages and disadvantages and could be successfully applied together.
It was shown also that the method of measuring the footprints is still valid and relevant [9].
The significant amount of data collected through permanent observations provided by a large
number of qualified field experts in Russia allowed defining with sufficient precision the number
and structure of the bear populations ([2, 10]).

predefined set of routes (transects) and analysis to determine the unique traces. It is a popular

and cheap method for monitoring the bear population. As a main quantitative indicator the
observed bears’ footprints are used. As additional quantitative indicator, excrements, found
bear markings, found dens, visual observation, etc were observed. The numerical estimation
of brown bear population is made using statistical methods, with the data collected on size of
front/rear paw of bears obtained during the National Monitorings (26-27 October 2011 and 1-2
November 2012) in the Western Rhodopes (see Figure 2), the territory of Pazardzhik region
and parts of the Plovdiv region. These data, together with data for nutritional importance of
forest types, enable us to evaluate the numerical population throughout Western area of the
Rhodope Mountains where there are large areas with a permanent presence of the species.
According to the geographical information system (GIS) in Bulgaria, the Western Rhodopes
bear habitat occupies an area of 4866.46 km2 and covers 27 forest administrative centers. Two
National monitorings in this habitat were carried out on 27-28 October 2011 and on 1-2 November 2012, (see Tables 1-2).
The number of transects during the first National monitoring was 48, covering 1850.95 km2

in 14 forest administrative centers in the North-West part of the Rhodopes. The selected
number of unique traces during this monitoring was 47, (see Table 1 and Table 3).
The number of transects during the second National monitoring was 45, covering 1766.75 km2
in 12 forest administrative centers in the North-West part of the Rhodopes. The selected number of unique traces during this monitoring was 43, (see Tables 2-3).
The transects are chosen to be located at approximately equal distance from each other
based on the random selection rule and cover 26 grids during the first monitoring and 24 grids
during the second monitoring from a total of 67 grids (see Figure 3).
In order to obtain the number of unique traces of bears the quantitative indicators described above were applied. Additional information was provided by the GPS coordinates of
the traces, considering also that the average distance traveled per day by one bear is approximately 10 km. This individual gait is calculated through a statistical program, using unpublished radio-tracking data, obtained during a project of the Smolian Regional Environmental
Inspection, Western Rhodopes.
Taking into account the collection data in each of the mentioned localized habitats we
estimated the population of brown bears by Maximum Likelihood Estimator ([7]) using singlespecies, single-season occupancy statistical model developed by MacKenzie et al.,[6]. This
statistical model described as algorithm is included in software developed by Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center.called PRESENCE [8].
We supposed that the traces of bears on the transects are Poisson distributed. Applying the
maximum likelihood method ([7]) we obtained the following point estimates for each habitat:
The statistical estimate of the brown bears population in the Western Rhodopes habitat is
N = 80.83, according to the monitoring in 2011 and N = 76.91, according the monitoring in
2012.

Gurov T., et al.

Note that these estimates were obtained only on the areas covered by transects. Here we
have in mind that transects are uniformly distributed, as each of them is in an area of 10 by 10
square kilometers.
In order to assess the brown bear population in the rest of the Rhodopes habitat, including
the areas without transects, we extrapolated the obtained estimates, taking into account the
areas covered by transects (see Table 3). Usually, the extrapolation approaches lead to big
deviation of the results. In order to decrease the error rate we used again GIS system where
the enclosed habitats of the brown bears in Bulgaria are divided on 4 type of areas (following
CORINE land cover classes), namely:
• A1 is an area with other land cover (transitional a wood bush or vegetable communities
of shrubs and grasses). This area has a mean value of Mahalanobis distance: D1 = 11.4;
• A2 is an area with coniferous forest and Mahalanobis distance: D2 = 6.8;
• A3 is an area with mixed forests and Mahalanobis distance: D3 = 3.6;
• A4 is an area with deciduous forest and Mahalanobis distance: D4 = 5.56.
This classification of bear habitats is done based on the statistical method of Mahalanobis
distance. 412 GPS locations of bears collected between 2006 and 2009 from all mountain areas
of the country ([17]) were used. Note that when Di > Dj this mean that the type of forests in
Ai area is used only seasonally by the bear. The weight coefficients ( xi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4), needed
for our extrapolation approach, could be calculated by the following formulas:

x1 ∗ A1 + x2 ∗ A2 + x3 ∗ A3 + x4 ∗ A4 = N, where xi = µ ∗ SD/Di , i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Here, SD is the sum of all mean values of Mahalanobis distance Di , N is the statistical
estimate obtained in the areas with transects during both monitorings. First, we found the
parameter µ using different type of areas Ai in the habitats with transects. The values of
these areas were taken from the GIS system (see Table 3). Then the weight coefficients (xi , i =
1, 2, 3, 4) were computed.
Finally, we subsequently calculate the population of the brown bears in the the total Ai
areas including that parts without transects.
The obtained estimates in The Rhodopes habitat can be rounded off up to integer numbers.
The population size of the local brown bear population in Rhodopes mountain is N = 208.20,
according to the monitoring in 2011 and N = 209.42, according to the monitoring in 2012.
(These numbers seem to be slightly overestimated after expert evaluation. The eventual error
could be related to the error in the measurement process in the field: some unique footprints with
relatively close size could be the footprints of one and the same individual which is measured
in some cases not very precisely).
In any case, taking into account the statistical error and the extrapolation error, we expect
the accumulation error in our calculations to be approximately 10 − 12%.
Let us repeat that in order to estimate the bear population, we have used 4 different densities
[17] for the 4 forest types. An alternative way to estimate the error, is to use the bootstrap
method presented in the next section.

Methods for distribution and error estimation in case
of consecutive observations

There are certain established techniques for evaluating the presence and abundance of species
when consecutive observations are performed along the same area. That is why the authors
have consistently proposed such observations to be carried out regularly, since they would allow
to obtain better estimates not only of the parameters of the bear population, but also of the
reliability of the methods that we use. If we assume that the observations are performed by
equally well trained teams and under similar conditions, we can postulate that there is a certain
uniform probability ψ of discovering a bear when it is present in a given area. Additionally it
may be assumed that the bears are dispersed according to a Poisson distribution with different
parameters λi for the different areas. In such a case it is well known that the probability of
finding exactly N bear traces in an area of size S of type i would be
∞

(λi S)k N
exp (−λi S)
ψ (1 − ψ)k−N

k=N

For two consecutive observations, the probability to find N1 traces the first time and N2 traces
the second time would be:
exp (−λi S)

∞

k=max(N1 ,N2 )

(λi S)k N1
ψ (1 − ψ)k−N1 ψ N2 (1 − ψ)k−N2

By multiplying over all the areas and taking into account the types of forests where the bears
are found, one can obtain the probability of the observed numbers of traces found. Now using
maximum likelihood estimation one could recover the values of λi and ψ. Our experience
is that these kind of estimations can be completed using a workstation in reasonable time.
When comparing the underlying assumptions about the distributions of bears we arrive at the
conclusion that his method is best used with small time between consecutive observations since
otherwise it results in lower values of the probability of discovering a bear. Once the values
of λi are evaluated, the total number of bears can be estimated by summing all the expected
numbers of bears Si jλi over all the areas, whether they were covered during the search for
traces or they have to be extrapolated. In order to estimate the error of this procedure, it is
advantageous to use the bootstrap method. For this, it is required to form multiple samples of
the areas with replacement and then to perform the same computations. From the evaluated
values for number of bears one can estimate confidence intervals or other quantities of interest.

Conclusion and future work

In this work we present a new approach to estimate the population of brown bears in the
Rhodope Mountains, one of the bears’ habitats in Bulgaria. The transect method is used to
gather data for traces of brown bears on predefined set of routes (transects). It is a cheap method
for gathering information by National monitoring, but it has a certain degree of uncertainty.
When collecting data during national monitoring, several sources of subjective errors were
observed, namely: (i) availability of feeders on some of the routes leading to correlation of the
results; (ii) uneven number of routes in the forestry areas; (iii) accuracy of trace determination
- wrong determination of front/rear paws.

Gurov T., et al.

The method presented in this paper resolves the problems described above.The results are
obtained using data from national monitorings in the autumn of 2011 and in 2012. Thus we
obtained a satisfactory estimate of the brown bear population in the Rhodope Mountains (about
210). We believe this method can be applied to estimate the population of the species in other
mountain ranges.
In order to improve the estimation of the brown bear population we need to perform a
National Monitoring each fall, preferably in the middle or end of October, which covers the
whole grid shown in Figure 3. Applying the principle of repeatability for the transects will
allow to compare the data with those from previous monitorings and observe the tendencies. It
is important to collect information about the type of forest where each trace was found. The
accumulation of data from several National monitorings will allow to assess the development
trend of the population. Based on the developed methodology, an estimate for population size
in the whole country can be obtained when more data is available. In addition to that an
estimate of the trend of brown bear population dynamics in the country shall be obtained,
when data from consecutive and consistent monitorings can be used.
