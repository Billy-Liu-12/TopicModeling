Abstract. A generalized Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) methodology
has been developed to simulate premixed and non-premixed gas-phase
and two-phase combustion in complex ﬂows such as those typically encountered in gas-turbine combustors. This formulation allows the study
and analysis of the fundamental physics involved in such ﬂows, i.e., vortex/ﬂame interaction, combustion dynamics and stability, fuel-air mixing, droplet vaporization, and other aspects of combustion. Results for
swirling premixed combustion undergoing combustion instability and for
swirling spray combustion in full-scale gas turbine engines are discussed
here. Results show that swirl can stabilize combustion in premixed system and can reduce the magnitude of the amplitude of the pressure
oscillation. In two-phase systems, signiﬁcant modiﬁcation to the high
shear regions due to vaporization of droplets is observed. Droplets are
also seen to concentrate in regions of low vorticity and when they vaporize, the gaseous fuel gets entrained into regions of high vorticity. This
process plays a major role in fuel-air mixing and combustion processes
in two-phase systems.

Introduction

The simulation of compressible, swirling, turbulent reacting ﬂows such as those
found in contemporary power generation and aircraft gas turbine systems pose
a great challenge due to the widely varying time and length scales that must
be resolved for accurate prediction. In addition to the diﬃculty in resolving
all the important turbulent scales, the presence of multiple modes/regimes of
combustion and the interaction between various chemical species and physical
phases (liquid and gas) in the same combustion device further complicates the
modeling requirements. Here, a methodology based on Large-Eddy Simulations
(LES) is developed and applied to these types of problems.
In LES, scales larger than the grid scale are computed using a time- and
space-accurate scheme while the eﬀects of the smaller, unresolved scales (assumed to be mostly isotropic) are modeled. For momentum transport closure
simple eddy viscosity based sub-grid models are suﬃcient since the unresolved
small-scales primarily provide dissipation for the energy transferred from the

large scales. However, combustion occurs at the molecular scales and the interaction between the small-scales of motion and molecular diﬀusion play a major
role in combustion and heat release. Thus, to properly account for heat release
eﬀects, the small scale processes must be simulated accurately (which is in conﬂict with the eddy viscosity approach used for momentum closure). In order to
deal with these distinctly diﬀerent modeling requirements, a sub-grid combustion
model has been developed [1] that resides within each LES cell and accounts for
the interaction between the small-scale mixing and reaction-diﬀusion processes.
Earlier studies [1,2,3,4] have established the ability of the LES model in premixed and non-premixed systems. In the present study, the dynamics of swirling
premixed ﬂames in a gas turbine combustor is studied using the same LES approach. For two-phase reacting ﬂow, this LES approach was extended [5] and
used within a zero-Mach number (incompressible) formulation to study spray
transport and vaporization in spatial mixing layers. In the present study, the
two-phase model has been implemented within the compressible LES model developed earlier [2,4] for gas phase combustion and then used to study spray
combustion in a high Reynolds number swirl ﬂow in a gas turbine combustor.

Large-Eddy Simulation Model

The Favre ﬁltered mass, momentum, energy, and species conservation equations
are solved in the LES approach. In addition, the unresolved turbulence kinetic energy is modeled with a single sub-grid kinetic energy equation, k sgs [2]. The subgrid kinetic energy is used to close the unresolved stresses and energy/species ﬂux
terms resulting from the ﬁltering operations. For premixed combustion studies,
a thin-ﬂame model [2] is employed while a Lagrangian droplet tracking method
[6] is used to explicitly track the droplets in the Eulerian gas ﬁeld in the spray
simulations. In this method, the liquid droplets are tracked with a Lagrangian
approach to explicitly compute the mass, momentum, energy and species transfer between the continuum and dispersed phase. The gas phase LES velocity
ﬁelds and the sub-grid kinetic energy are used to estimate the instantaneous gas
velocity at the droplet location. Drag eﬀects due to the droplets on the gas phase
is explicitly included. Heat transfer from gas phase to the liquid phase aids in the
vaporization and the subsequent mass transfer to the gas phase. This provides
the thermal coupling between the two phase. Thus, full coupling is achieved
between the two phases in the simulation.
The governing equations mentioned above have been withheld for brevity;
however, they along with further details can be found elsewhere [2,5].

Numerical Methodology

The LES equations of motion are solved on a three dimensional, boundaryconforming, grid using an explicit ﬁnite-volume scheme that is fourth-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time. No-slip, adiabatic wall con-

ditions conditions are used along with non-reﬂecting inﬂow/out-ﬂow boundary
conditions [7].
The conﬁguration used for both premixed and two-phase combustion studies
consists of an inlet pipe expanding into the larger cylindrical combustion chamber. A swirling velocity proﬁle with a swirl number of 0.56 is imposed at the
inlet boundary. The mean inlet mass ﬂow rate, temperature, and pressure are
0.435 Kilograms/second, 673 Kelvin, and 11.8 atmospheres, respectively. The
Reynolds number based on inlet bulk velocity and inlet diameter is 330,000. An
inﬂow turbulent ﬁeld is generated by using a speciﬁed turbulence intensity (7%)
on a randomly generated Gaussian ﬁeld.
For two-phase (spray) LES, a dilute spray is introduced at the inlet plane
using 20 µm droplets (future studies will incorporate a log-normal size distribution). The Stokes number, the ratio of droplet to ﬂow time scales, is approximately 8.2. Droplets below a cut-oﬀ size of 5 µm are assumed to instantly
vaporize and mix. Gas phase velocities at the particle locations are interpolated
using a fourth-order scheme. The governing Lagrangian (two-phase) equations
are integrated with a fourth-order Runge-Katta scheme. Elastic collisions are
assumed for particle/wall interaction.
A grid resolution of 141 × 65 × 81 is employed for both the premixed and twophase LES. Clustering of the grid in regions of high shear is used. For the spray
simulations, 120,000 droplet groups are tracked in the computational domain.
The LES solver is implemented on massively parallel systems using domain
decomposition and standard Message-Passing Interface (MPI) libraries. The parallel algorithm exhibits good scalability (85% parallel eﬃciency on 128 CPU’s)
on several high-performance computing platforms. Simulations on the Cray T3E900 typically require 900 and 3400 CPU hours for a single ﬂow-through (the time
for a ﬂuid element to traverse the entire computational domain) for the premixed
and spray calculations, respectively. In general, 5 to 10 ﬂow-through-times are
simulated for statistical analysis. The memory requirements for the premixed
and spray computations are 2.9 and 12.3 Gigabytes, respectively.

Combustion Dynamics in a Premixed System

Accurate prediction of the coupling between unsteady heat release and pressure
oscillation is critical to simulate combustion dynamics in dump combustors. However, proper resolution of this coupling is especially diﬃcult due to the unsteadiness of the controlling processes (e.g., fuel injection) and the high nonlinearity of
the interactions between turbulent mixing, acoustic wave motion, and unsteady
heat release. Large-scale structures in the ﬂow play a key role in the coupling
process by controlling the fuel-air mixing. In non-swirling ﬂows, axisymmetric
coherent vortices are shed at the dump plane and these structures interact with
the acoustic waves and heat release in the combustor. In a highly swirling ﬂow,
azimuthal (helical) instability modes are present and the interaction between
the modes of motion is more complicated. In fact, swirl can stabilize or even
destabilize instability in sudden expansion ﬂows [8]. Therefore, the identiﬁcation

1130

of ﬂow or system parameters that control swirl induced instability is extremely
important for the design of stable combustion systems.
The eﬀect of swirl on lean premixed ﬂames is investigated in this study. Although lean burning systems have some signiﬁcant advantages (such as reduced
pollutant emission and increased fuel eﬃciency), lean operation is sensitive to
small ﬂuctuations which under certain conditions can get ampliﬁed resulting in
high-amplitude pressure oscillations. This phenomenon is often called combustion instability and understanding this phenomenon is the focus of the current
study.
Two simulations are conducted in order to observe the eﬀects of heat release
on the dynamics of combustion in the swirling combustor. Case A simulates a
passive ﬂame (zero heat-release) while case B includes heat-release with a ﬂame
temperature of 1807 Kelvin. In the limit of zero heat release, the thin-ﬂame ﬁeld
does not eﬀect the ﬂow and therefore, acts as a passive scalar that is advected
by the ﬂuid ﬂow without aﬀecting the ﬂow ﬁeld. In the heat release case, the
ﬂame responds to the ﬂow ﬁeld that is modiﬁed due to heat release and thermal
expansion eﬀects.
The mean and ﬂuctuating axial and radial velocity proﬁles across the diameter of the combustor (at the center plane) are shown in Fig. 1. The proﬁles
are shown at a non-dimensional distance of X/D0 = 0.2 (D0 is the diameter of
the inlet pipe) downstream of the dump plane. Near the centerline, the mean
axial velocity seems to be reduced due to heat release while the radial velocity is increased. Assuming a conical ﬂame, the ﬂame-normal expansion will be
predominantly aligned in the radial direction. This divergence (broadening of
the streamlines) would cause the reduction in the mean axial velocity inside the
ﬂame region and the corresponding increase in the radial component. Additionally, the magnitude of recirculation after the sudden expansion is reduced in the
presence of heat release.
Root-Mean-Square (RM S) velocity proﬁles at the same axial location are
shown in Figs. 1(b, d). In the shear layer region, R/D0 ≈ 0.5, both simulations
show high ﬂuctuations; however, the inner core region has some distinct diﬀerences. Similar to its mean counterpart, the ﬂuctuating axial velocity is reduced
near the centerline. The other two components show the same trend of lower
velocity ﬂuctuations associated with heat release. This reduction is caused by
the increased viscous dissipation in the hot products.
Shown in Fig. 2 are the pressure ﬂuctuation spectra for the two cases. The
pressure signals were recorded at the base of the dump plane where the vorticity
is low. Both simulations reveal a dominant frequency (plus a harmonic) at a
Strouhal number (deﬁned as f D0 /U0 ) of 0.88 for the cold ﬂow and 1.12 for
the reacting ﬂow (with harmonics at 1.76 and 2.24, respectively). Analysis of
the pressure amplitudes and phase angles of these pressure signals along the
longitudinal axis of the combustor indicated a 3/4 wave with a wave length
proportional to the combustor length (from dump plane to diﬀuser). This wave
shape is acoustic as indicated by the frequency shift from a cold ﬂow (Case A)

speed of sound at the higher temperature).
As with the RM S velocity proﬁles, Fig. 2(a) gives credence to the attenuation
eﬀect of heat release. While the acoustic wave shape is the same, the amplitude
is attenuated by almost 700%. A time segment of the global Rayleigh parameter
(R̄(t)) [9] (not to scale) is given in Fig. 2(b). Positive R̄(t) corresponds to ampliﬁcation while negative indicates neutral oscillations or attenuation. This time
sequence shows stable operation (R̄(t) is nearly always (-)), i.e. the pressure, p� ,
and heat release, ∆q � , ﬂuctuations are not in phase. Only at the higher harmonic
of the pressure signal (St = 2.24) does ampliﬁcation occur, indicating that the
heat release oscillations are at or near the higher frequency.
Figure 3 shows a mean and an instantaneous view of the three-dimensional
ﬂame surface. All pictures were taken with the same frame of references to allow
direct comparison of the ﬂame dimensions. Due to heat release and the associated
thermal expansion, the mean ﬂame surface is repelled (expands) outward and is

also longer. However, no signiﬁcant visual distinction can be made between the
cold and hot instantaneous ﬂame fronts. Both show wrinkling/elongation in the
azimuthal direction (rib-shaped structures).
The rib-shaped structures in the ﬂame front are aligned with vortex tubes
generated in the swirling boundary layer that is shed from at the dump plane.
An example of the vortex shedding from Case B is shown in Fig. 4(a) & (b). Fig.
4(a) shows the azimuthal (ωθ , dark gray) and axial (ωx , light gray) vorticity.
The large-scale, ring structures are predominantly ωθ . Braid structures (mostly
ωx ) are observed in the region between the shed vortices. As the ring vortices
shed, they entrain the ﬂame and carry it along (shown in Fig. 4(b)). The ﬂame is
drawn outwards till the vortex breaks down. This vortex-ﬂame interaction forms
a ﬂame oscillation cycle with a time-scale proportional to the vortex shedding
rate. The shedding rate is strongly coupled with the longitudinal acoustic waves

dump plane causing vortex roll-up).

Spray Combustion

Three simulations are discussed here. A non-reacting gas-phase-only case, a nonreacting two-phase case (i.e., only momentum coupling) and a reacting (using a
global inﬁnite-rate kinetics) two-phase case. In all three cases, the same swirling
inﬂow was employed. A general observation, for all three cases, shows that the
heavy particles do not follow the gas phase due to their larger inertia; however,
as they get smaller, due to vaporization, they equilibrate with the gas phase.
Smaller droplets are observed in the recirculation bubble near the dump plane.
On the other hand, in the momentum coupled case, fewer particles are seen in
the recirculation bubble due to the large Stokes number associated with the
particles. Large dispersion of droplets towards the outer region of the combustor
(not shown) is observed. This radial spread is seen to increase with downstream
distance. Larger particles that reach the wall bounce back and move downstream.
Further downstream, the distribution of the droplets tends to be more uniform.
Figure 5(a) shows the ISO-surface of the vorticity and droplet distribution in
the combustor. Coherent vortex structures which are seen near the dump plane
in the gas-phase simulations are quickly disintegrated in the presence of droplets.
Analysis shows that droplets tend to accumulate in regions of low vorticity. This

type of preferential accumulation of droplets in regions of low vorticity was also
observed in earlier studies of simpler shear ﬂows [5]. Conditional expectation
of droplet number density conditioned on vorticity is shown in Fig. 5(b). The
abscissa in this plot is the normalized by the vorticity magnitude. As can be
seen, the probability density function is asymmetric and is biased towards low
vorticity.
Figures 6(a) and (c) show respectively, the mean gas-phase velocity proﬁles
in the stream-wise and transverse directions. These radial proﬁles are shown at
a non-dimensional distance of 0.14 (which is slightly downstream of the dump
plane). As was observed in the premixed case, the mean axial velocity is reduced
with heat release. In addition, the presence of particles (with or without heat
release) reduces the mean velocity, especially in the shear layer region. Thus,
particle drag eﬀects reduces large radial variation in the velocity proﬁles while
heat release (and the associated thermal expansion) further smooths out radial
gradients.
Further analysis shows that the swirl has been signiﬁcantly attenuated due
to the presence of the droplets. It should be noted that for ﬂows with a large
droplet to gas-phase density ratio and droplet sizes smaller than the Kolmogorov
scale, the particle paths, the relative velocities (between the two phases), and the
particle drag are all uniquely determined by the Stokes number. Therefore, future
studies at diﬀerent Stokes numbers and more realistic droplet size distributions
are needed.
Figures 6(b) and (d) show respectively, the root mean square velocity ﬂuctuations in the stream-wise and transverse directions. It can be seen that the
turbulent ﬂuctuations have been attenuated in the presence of the particles. The
presence of droplets decreases the turbulence level by introducing additional dissipation. In particular, turbulent ﬂuctuations have been attenuated signiﬁcantly

in regions where turbulent intensities are high in unladen ﬂows (i.e., in regions
of high shear). This is because in these regions, the local Stokes number based
on the turbulent time scales is high leading to increased attenuation of the turbulence closer to the shear layer where the turbulence production is very high.
This observation is consistent with an earlier study [10]. Turbulence levels in the
recirculating zones are not aﬀected signiﬁcantly, due to the presence of fewer
particles there.

Conclusions

Simulation of high Re, swirling premixed and spray ﬂames in full-scale gas turbine combustors have been carried out using the same LES solver. This LES
approach includes a more fundamental treatment of the interaction between the

1136

ﬂame, gas-phase, and liquid ﬂow dynamics. Combustion dynamics in the lean
premixed system has been simulated and results show that the dominant mode
shape is the three-quarter acoustic wave shape in the combustor. Results also
show that swirl and heat release eﬀects can stabilize the system by reducing
the amplitude of pressure oscillation. Simulation of spray combustion show that
many global features such as the preferential concentration of droplets in low
vorticity regions, droplet dispersion and turbulence modiﬁcation by the particles are all captured reasonably well. However, many other issues such as the
eﬀect of the mass loading ratio, droplet vaporization rate, and Stokes number on
the turbulent reacting ﬂow needs to be studied further. These issues are currently
being addressed and will be reported in the near future.
