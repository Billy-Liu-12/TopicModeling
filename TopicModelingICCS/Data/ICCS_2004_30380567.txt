Abstract. In this work an original method for the measure of semantic
correlation between messages generated by communicative agents in multiagent
system is presented. This method is applied to the algorithm for finding the set
of agents with the maximal cognitive capacity to observe the states of the
objects from external world. It is assumed that the generated messages are the
result of the process of language generation, represented by the algorithm for
the choice of relevant semantic messages. This algorithm relates belief formulas
to the internal agents’ knowledge states.

1 Introduction
In this paper a method for the measure of semantic correlation between messages in
multiagent system is presented. It is assumed that each agent a∈A={a1, a2,..., az} is
situated in a real, ontologically independent world. In this world some objects
O={o1,o2,...,oS } exist. States of these objects are a target of the agents’ cognitive
processes. Each object o∈O is described by means of properties from the set
∆={P1,P2,...,PK}. In particular, the cognitive agent a∈A={a1,a2,...,az} can think of an
object o∈O as having or not having a particular property P∈∆. Perceptions collected
by the agents are ordered in relation to a line of time points T={t0,t1,t2,..} [9]. Each
agent is equipped with the communication language, which makes it possible for an
agent to generate the logic formulas. Each formula is interpreted from the agent's
point of view as external, logical representation of beliefs on current state of the
object. Each formula is built of the modal operator of belief, two names of the
properties and logic operator of belief. The scope of the agents’ language is given in a
Table 1.
The basic assumption is that, if an agent can not observe the current state of the
particular object, then he refers to the overall private knowledge and applies dedicated
algorithm for the choice of relevant semantic messages. This algorithm, which reflects
the process of symbol grounding, applies a new and alternative approach to define the
epistemic concept of belief. The symbol grounding is understood as a mental
phenomenon that assigns meaning to language and relates language symbols to the
external objects in a very certain way [5], [7], [8]. The algorithm for the choice of
relevant messages relates belief formulas to internal representations of an object
rather than to ontologically existing entity. In consequence each formula is treated by

the cognitive agent as true, if and only if this formula is satisfied by the overall state
of agent encapsulated knowledge. Such an approach to understanding satisfaction
relation is alternative to the commonly known extensional definition of the
satisfaction formulas accepted within Tarskian theory of truth [7]. In this sense the
algorithm realises an original way of semantic and interpreted language generation.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the level of formula grounding by measure of
semantic closeness of the messages, which are generated individually by the agents
using the algorithm for the choice of relevant messages. It is assumed that these
formulas are syntactically identical. The question is: if the semantic of these formulas
is also identical. We want to compare the states of agents knowledge which let them
generate such formulas. As a result of this comparison the set of agents with the
maximal cognitive capacity to observe the states of objects and maximal similarity of
knowledge states to the median state of knowledge of all the agents is computed.

2 Basic Notions
The state of the external world, recognised by the agent a∈A at the particular time
point tn is represented in its body as a base profile and is given as:
BP (tn)= <O,P 1(tn),P−1(tn), P±1(tn),...,P K(tn),P−K(tn), P±K(tn)>
a

+

+

Remark 1. O={o1,o2,...,oS} and each o denotes a unique cognitive representation of a
particular object of the external world W.
Remark 2. For i=1,2,...,K, P j(tn)⊆O and P−j(tn)⊆O. For each o∈O the relation o∈P i(tn)
holds if and only if the agent has perceived that this object o possesses atomic
−
property Pi. For each o∈O the relation o∈P i(tn) holds if and only if the agent has
perceived that this object o does not posses the atomic property Pi.

Remark 3. The set of objects P i(tk)= O/(P i(tk)∪P−i(tk)) is called the area of agent’s
±
incompetence related to the property Pi. For each o∈O the relation o∈P i(tn) holds if
and only if the agent could not perceive the state of this object o in relation to the
property Pi.
The overall state of perceptions, stored by the agent a∈A, is given as a temporal data
base consisted of the set of base profiles:
+

+

KS (tc) ={BP (tn): tn∈T and tn≤tc},
a

a

where tn, tc are time points.

3 The Idea of an Algorithm for the Choice of Relevant Messages
In this section the idea of an algorithm for the choice of relevant semantic messages is
explained. Understanding the essence of this algorithm is a key point in understanding
the method for the measure semantic correlation between messages, discussed in
Section 4. It is assumed, that at the time point tc the state of an object o∈O in relation
to the properties Pi and Pj for at least two agents is not known and can not be verified
by sensing:
∀ PB (tc)∈KS (tc). (o∈P±i(tc) and o∈P±j(tc)) for a∈A’⊆A, card(A’)>1, i,j∈K
a

a

(1)

where A’ denotes the set of agents, that can not observe the state of an object o in
relation to the properties Pi and Pj.
a
All experiences, internally stored by each agent, represented by KS (tc), a∈A’, are
the source of a meaning for the external formulas. The algorithm for the choice of
relevant semantic messages is consisted of five steps [9], [10], [11]:
Step1. Message oriented classification of perceptions. The procedure for applying all
stored perceptions uses a simple classification of empirical content in KS(tk). In
particular, the following classes of base profiles are taken into account:
a
a
a
a
+
+
a) C 1(tc) ={BP (tn):a∈A’, tn≤tc, BP (tn)∈KS (tc) and both o∈P i(tn) and o∈P j(tn) hold for
a
BP (tn)}
Obviously, this class of data consists of all base profiles stored up to the time point tc,
+
in which the object o has been found by the agent a as having both properties P i
+
and P j.
a
a
a
a
+
b) C 2(tc) ={BP (tn): a∈A’, tn≤tc, BP (tn)∈KS (tc) and both o∈P i(tn) and o∈P−j(tn) hold
a
for BP (tn)}
a
a
a
a
+
c) C 3(tc) ={BP (tn): a∈A’, tn≤tc, BP (tn)∈KS (tc) and both o∈P−i(tn) and o∈P j(tn) hold
a
for BP (tn)}
a
a
a
a
d) C 4(tc) ={BP (tn): a∈A’, tn≤tc, BP (tn)∈KS (tc) and both o∈P−i(tn) and o∈P−j(tn) hold
a
for BP (tn)}
a
a
a
a
Interpretations for C 2(tc), C 3(tc) and C 4(tc) are similar to C 1(tc).
a
a
a
a
The importance of C 1(tc), C 2(tc), C 3(tc) and C 4(tc) for the choice of relevant messages
results from the semantic relations given in Table 2 (see also [5], [8]).

Step 2. A unique representative CBP m(tc), m=1,2,3,4 of all perceptions stored in
a
a
C m(tk) is computed. The structure CPB m(tc) is given as a consensus profile and
interpreted as the agreement on the overall knowledge stored in a particular class
a
a
C m(tk). Obviously, from the formal point of view the consensus CBP m(tc) from
a
C m(tk)⊆KS(tc), m=1,2,3,4 is given as:
CBP m(tc)= <O,cP 1(tn),cP−1(tn), cP±1(tn),...,cP K(tn),cP−K(tn),cP±K(tn)>
a

+

+

On this stage of algorithm the knowledge representation in the form of the base
profiles is transformed to the single profile.
a

In order to determine CPB m(tc) some rational requirements need to be fulfilled.
Examples of the sets of requirements, postulates and algorithms based on these
postulates are given in [6].
a

a

Step 3. For each m=1,2,3,4 the agent a computes the distance d m between CBP m(tc)
a
and the current profile BP (tc). This distance reflects the numerical similarity between
a
a
each set C m(tc), m=1,2,3,4 and the current base profile PB m(tc). An original approach
to computing this type of measure is given in [9].
a

Step 4. The agent a computes a choice function values V m(X), m=1,…,6. Each of
these values is derived from a subset of {d1,d2,d3,d4} relevant to a particular message
from Table 1. The rules for determining decision values are:
a
a
V 1(X) is derived for B (Pi(o)∧Pj(o)) from the set of distances X={d1}
a
a
V 2(X) is derived for B (Pi(o)∧¬Pj(o)) from the set of distances X={d2}
a
a
V 3(X) is derived for B (¬Pi(o)∧ Pj(o)) from the set of distances X={d3}
a
a
V 4(X) is derived for B (¬ Pi(o)∧¬Pj(o)) from the set of distances X={d4}
a
a
V 5(X) is derived for B (Pi(o)∨Pj(o)) from the set of distances X={d2,d3}
a
a
V 6(X) is derived for B (Pi(o)∨Pj(o)) from the set of distances X={d1,d2,d3}
Obviously, the choice of the subset of {d1,d2,d3,d4} is strictly related to this part of
a
KS (tc) to which a considered message is related. The choice function and some
requirements, which should be fulfilled by this function are discussed in details in
[12].
Step 5. The message is chosen by the agent a as externally appropriate, for which the
a
decision value V m(X) is maximal.

4 The Semantic Correlation between Messages
As a result of applying an algorithm for the choice of relevant semantic messages,
described in Section 3, each agent a∈A’⊆A generates one belief formula about the
current state of an object o∈O. It is assumed that all of these formulas are
syntactically identical. Now we want to find out if the semantics of these formulas are
also the same. It is assumed that from the agent's point of view stored perceptions are
the original source of any meaning accessible for cognitive processes of symbol
grounding. The assumptions about the meaning of formulas is closed to the
phenomenological approach to analysis of meaning in which the meaning of any
language symbol can ever be reduced by the cognitive agent to reflections of basic
empirical data. Each formula is treated as an external reflection of agent’s internal
knowledge state. In other words, the only meaning that can ever be assigned by the
cognitive agent to language symbols (formulas) comes out of the content of
remembered experiences [11]. In this context of meaning it might be possible that one
belief formula for two agents means completely different. In this paper we propose
the method for the measure semantic correlation between messages. This method is
applied to the algorithm for finding the set R of agents with the maximal cognitive
capacity to observe the states of objects and maximal similarity of knowledge state to
the median state of knowledge. In this algorithm called the algorithm for finding the
set of knowledge richest and reliable agents (KRRA), the consensus profiles
a
a
CPB m(tc), a∈A’, m∈{1,2,3,4} for classes of perception C m(tc) semantically correlated
with external formula (see Table 2) are taken into account.
4.1 The Idea of KRRA
Let idea of an algorithm KRRA can be described as follows:
A’

Step 1. Determine the set CPB r(tc), r∈{1,2,...,6}of consensus profiles semantically
related with the external formulas generated by the agents from the set A’. Each
formula has its tag name (see Table 1) and depending on the external formula
generated by each agent a∈A’ the proper set of base profiles is determined. In
particular, the following sets of base profiles are taken into account:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

Step 2. For the set CPB r(tc), r∈{1,2,...,6} compute the median profile Med r(tc),
r∈{1,2,...,6}. Median profile is interpreted as the agreement of the overall knowledge
A’
stored in a particular set CPB r(tc) and has the same structure as consensus profile
a
+
CPB m(tc),m∈{1,2,3,4} and consists of the following sets: medP i(tn), medP−i(tn),

medP±i(tn), i∈{1,2,...,K}. The distance between median profile Med r(tc) and each
a
A’
consensus profile CPB m(tc)∈CPB r(tc), a∈A’, must be minimal. For the defined

distance function d(Med r(tc),CPB m(tc)) holds [13]:

function values between each median profile from the set MedUniverse and each

r∈{1,2,...,6} (Step 3 of KRRA)and the information power of a particular consensus
a
profile CPB m(tc) understood by means of the cardinality of objects, which states are
known for an agent a∈A’ in this consensus profile (Step 4 of KRRA). Let us note that
MC
the value D a should be minimal. It means that the agent with the cognitive range
CM
closed to cognitive range of other agents’ is needed. On the other hand the value D a
should be maximal. In this case the scope of agent’s cognition is taken into account.
The important is that only known states of objects are taken into account. As a
consequence the objects from agents’ area incompetence are omitted.

Let the external world W consist of atom objects O={o1,o2,o2,...o11}.At the time point
t12 the state of an object o1 in relation to the properties P1 and P2 is not known for the
agents A’={a1, a2, a5,a7}⊆A={o1,o2,...,o20}. After applying the algorithm for the choice

of relevant semantic messages the agents generate the messages B={B (Pi(o)∧Pj(o)):

5 Conclusions
Although the symbol grounding problem has been studied for quite a long time, there
is still a lack of mathematical models for simplest languages’ grounding [11].
The aim of this paper was to investigate the level of grounding the belief formulas
generated individually by the agents in multiagent system after applying the algorithm
for the choice of relevant messages. The semantic closeness of the messages was
investigated. A method for computing the set of agents with the maximal cognitive
capacity to observe the states of objects and maximal similarity of knowledge states to
the median state of knowledge of all agents in a system was presented.
