Abstract
The excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorescence of the synthesised 2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-5-(N,Ndiethylamino)phenol (1) was studied using spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The changes in the electronic transition,
energy levels, and orbital diagrams were investigated using the ab initio molecular orbital computation [B3LYP/6-31G(d)].
Compound (1) is fluorescent; it shows a single absorption and dual emission in solvents of different polarities. Experimental
absorption and emission wavelengths are in good agreement with those predicted using the Time-Dependent Density Functional
Theory [TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d)]. The photophysical properties of compound (1) are compared with benzoxazole and
benzimidazole analogues.
Keywords: Benzothiazole, ESIPT, fluorescence, solvatochromism, TD-DFT.

1. Introduction

Benzimidazoles [1,2], benzothiazoles [3] and benzoxazoles [4] are important class of fused heterocyclic
systems. These moieties are attractive targets for synthesis since they often exhibit diverse and important biological
properties. These compounds possess different pharmacological activities such as antibiotic [5], antifungal [6],
antiviral [7], anticancer [8], antimicrobial [9] and antiparkinson [10] properties. Along with biological applications,
these classes of compounds are also used in high-technological applications as probes due to their fluorescence
properties [11,12]. Among the various types of fluorescent imidazole, oxazole and thiazoles, 2-hydroxy substituted
imidazole, oxazole and thiazoles are more attractive due to favorable excited state intramolecular proton transfer

(ESIPT) process [13]. 2-(2'-Hydroxyphenyl)-1,3-benzoxazole is well known to be of importance as the basic
skeleton of its molecular structure can undergo ESIPT [14].
ESIPT is a fundamental process that has received considerable attention, since its first discovery by Weller
[15]. ESIPT arises when a molecule contains both an acidic and a basic site which upon electronic excitation
experience an enhancement in acidity or basicity, respectively [16]. In most examples of ESIPT processes, an OH or
NH group is the acidic site, while a basic site usually contains a heteroatom such as heterocyclic nitrogen or a
carbonyl group.
A variety of molecules have intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that may be photo-induced to
undergo proton transfer. ESIPT can be observed in a variety of such molecules that contain both hydrogen donor
and acceptor in close proximity [17-21]. An intramolecular hydrogen bond generally formed in the ground state will
migrate to the neighboring proton acceptor leading to a phototautomer responsible for ESIPT, Scheme 1. In the
general family of 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (1), benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzotriazole, the ESIPT
phototautomer gives rise to an emission with large Stokes shift [22-23]. The high intensity of fluorescence emission
and large Stokes shift due to intramolecular proton transfer phenomena allow these molecules to have many
interesting applications. ESIPT molecules are used in luminescent materials [24,25], photopatterning [26],
chemosensors, proton transfer laser [27], photostabilizers [28,29], molecular logic gates [30], molecular probes [31],
metal ion sensors [32-34], radiation hard-scintillator counters [35] and organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) [36].
Scheme 1: ESIPT Process

In continuation with our work on benzimidazole, benzothiazole and benzoxazole chemistry [37-39], here in this
paper, we report the changes in the electronic transition, energy levels, and orbital diagrams of compound (1) and its
analogues (compounds 2 and 3), Figure1, by Time Dependent-Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) computations.
The computational results were correlated with the experimental spectral emission.

2. Computational Methods
The ground state geometry of the compounds (1-3) and their keto tautomers in their Cs symmetry were
optimized using the tight criteria in the gas phase using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the B3LYP
functional. The B3LYP method combines Becke’s three parameter exchange functional (B3) [40] with the nonlocal
correlation functional by Lee, Yang and Parr (LYP) [41]. The basis set used for all atoms was 6-31G(d) [42-45].
Optimisation was also done in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform,
ethylacetate, dioxane, acetone, and dimethylsulphoxide using the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) [40]. The
vibrational frequencies of the optimized structures were computed using the same method to verify that they
correspond to local minima on the energy surface. The vertical excitation energies at the ground-state equilibrium
geometries were calculated with TD-DFT [46]. The low-lying first singlet excited state (S1) of each conformer was
relaxed using the TD-DFT to obtain its minimum energy geometry. The difference between the energies of the
optimized geometries at the first singlet excited state and the ground state was used in computing the emissions [47].
All electronic structure computations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program [48].
3. Relative quantum yield calculations
Quantum yields of the compounds in the different solvents were evaluated for short as well as longer
emission and anthracene was used as the standard. Quantum yields were calculated by using the comparative
method [38]. Absorption and emission characteristics of the standard and the compounds in the solvents were
measured at different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 ppm level). Emission intensity values were plotted against
absorbance values and linear plots were obtained. Gradients were calculated for the compounds in each solvent and
for the standards. All the measurements were done by keeping the parameters constant such as solvent and slit
width. Relative quantum yields of synthesized compounds [37] in different solvents were calculated by using
equation 1 [38].

absorption and emission properties obtained by computation. Compound 1 absorbs in the range 378-384 nm and this
is in good agreement with vertical excitation 362-366 nm obtained by computation. The difference between
observed and computed absorbance is in the range 15-21 nm (666666-476190 cm-1). Compound 1 shows single
absorption and dual emission in DCM, acetonitrile, chloroform and ethyl acetate. Compound 1 shows emission
maxima in between 406-434 nm which is in good agreement with the computed emission. Emission intensity of
compound 1 is high in the polar solvents DMSO and DMF, while low intensity was observed in ethyl acetate, 1,4dioxane, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetone, acetonitrile, methanol and ethanol. Short emission was observed
below 422 nm and longer around 434 nm. Compound 1 shows Stokes shift in the range between 22-41 nm for short
emission and 42-50 nm for long emission. Large Stokes shift 41 nm was observed in DMSO for short emission and
in 50 nm in ethylacetate and dioxane for longer emission. Quantum yields in each solvent for short as well as long
emission were evaluated and the results are summarized in Table 1. The results reveal that quantum yield is high at
short emission as compared to longer emission. Absorption properties of compound 1 are independent of solvent
polarities, while emission data shows that emission of compound 1 depends on the solvent polarities. Fluorescence
spectra of compound 1 in different solvents are shown in Figure 2 (SI) (Supplementary Information, available
with the authors).
The experimental and computed photophysical properties of 2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-5-(N,Ndiethylamino) phenol 1 were compared with results of similar analogues 2-(1,3-benzimidazole-2-yl)-5-(N,Ndiethylamino) phenol 2 and 2-(1,3-benzoxazole-2-yl)-5-(N,N-diethylamino) phenol 3 reported [37] from our
research group. Compound 3 shows red shift for absorption as well as emission as compared to compounds 1 and 2
except in dioxane where, compound 1 shows red shift. The % deviation between observed absorption and vertical
excitation obtained from computation is high in the case of compound 3 as compared to compounds 1 and 2. The
large difference between experimental absorption and vertical excitation is observed for compound 3. 2-(1,3Benzothiazol-2-yl)-5-(N,N-diethylamino) phenol and structurally similar analogues 1 and 2 show single absorption
and dual emission. Compound 1 shows single emission in the polar solvents methanol, DMF, acetone, and DMF,
and dual emission in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethanol, ethylacetate and DMSO. Compound 2
shows single emission in ethanol, DMF, DCM, ethyl acetate and dioxane and dual emission in other solvents
studied. Compound 3 shows single emission at longer wavelength in DMF and single short emission in dioxane.
Compound 3 shows large Stokes shifts compared to compounds 1 and 2. Quantum yields of the compounds in
different solvents were evaluated. It was observed that the quantum yield of compound 3 is high as compared to
compounds 1 and 2. The quantum yields of compounds 1 and 2 are almost same in all the solvents studied. The
results of absorption, emission, quantum yields, % deviation and Stokes shifts are summarised in Table 1

In case of the keto form, vertical excitation and emission of the compound were computed using DFT and
TD-DFT in all the solvents Table 2 (SI). The keto form of compound 1 shows vertical excitation at 377 nm in all
the solvents and emission maxima is in range between 406 and 425 nm. Red shift is observed in polar protic
solvents namely DMSO, methanol, ethanol and DMF.
Frontier molecular orbitals and their energies were obtained in the gas phase and HOMO and LUMO
orbital diagrams are shown in Figure 3 (SI) for compound 1. The compounds contain electron donor and acceptor
system, the substituted benzothiazole unit acts as a electron acceptor and the N, N-diethyl and hydroxy substituted
benzene unit act as electron donor. In the case of HOMO, the electron density is distributed across the compound 1,
while in the LUMO, the electron density is localized along the benzothiazole unit of compound 1 and it shows nodes
on N,N-diethyl group.
Effect of solvent polarity on the ground and excited state dipole moments
Polarity of solvents affects the fluorescence properties due to solvation or hydrogen bonding with
heteroatom present in the compounds. Dipole moments depend on polarity and heteroatom present in the system
[49]. Dipole moment of compound 1 in the ground state and excited state for the enol and keto form was computed
for short as well as long emission in the solvents. The ratio of dipole moment in excited to ground state in different
solvents was plotted against the solvent function (ETN). The solvent polarity function was used from the literature
[49]. The dipole moment of compound 1 is high for the enol form compared to corresponding keto form. The dipole
moment of compound 1 is greater in excited state as compared to the ground state for the enol as well as the keto
form. The experimental dipole moment of compound 1 was correlated with dipole obtained computationally and the
results indicate that both the dipole moments are good agreement with each other, see Table 3 (SI). The plot of
dipole moment versus polarity function is shown in Figure 4 (SI).
Dipole moments of the ground as well as the excited state of compound 1 were compared with compounds
2 and 3, and results are also summarised in Table 3 (SI). Experimental dipole moment and dipole moment obtained
by TD-DFT computations are very close to each other for compound 2 for short as well as long emission. In the case
of compound 1, experimental dipole moment at longer emission (1.40 Debye) is very close to theoretical dipole
moment, while significant difference is observed for short emission. In the case of compound 3, experimental dipole
moments for short as well as long emission are not close to the dipole moments obtained computationally. The
dipole moment of the excited state is larger as compared to ground state for all the three compounds.
Structural properties of compound 1
ESIPT is the process in which hydrogen is transferred in the excited state, after photo-excitation the enol
form in the first excited singlet state undergoes redistribution of charge densities leading to a different geometry in
terms of bond angle and bond distance favouring a proton transfer and ultimately the excited state keto form, which
becomes an emissive species. In the excited state the hydrogen attached to oxygen approaches near to the basic
nitrogen of thiazole unit via hydrogen bonding for transfer of proton. Molecular planarity is also the major factor
necessary for ESIPT facilitating the proton transfer in the excited state. This ESIPT phenomenon is evident from the
TD-DFT computation. Changes in bond angles, bond lengths, Mulliken charges of the ground and excited state of
optimized geometries of the enol as well as the keto form are explained with the help of TD-DFT.
As a representative example the structural view of compound 1 in the ground and excited state of the enol as well as
keto form are presented in Figure 5 (SI). In the case of compound 1, the N21-H23 hydrogen bonding distance
decreases by 0.0333 Å from ground state the enol (1.7430 Å) to the excited state enol (1.7097 Å) form. The O22H23 bond distance increases by 0.0073 Å from the ground state enol (0.9957 Å) to the excited enol (1.0030 Å),
which means that in excited state enol the H23 approaches near to the N21 via hydrogen bonding. The bond distance
O22-C1 decreases by 0.0022 Å forms ground state enol (1.3502 Å) to the excited state enol (1.3480 Å) which is
further decreased by 0.0342 Å in the case of the excited keto form (1.2805 Å). The bond angle H23-O22-C1

804

increases by 0.1o from the ground state enol (123.6o) to the excited state enol (127.7o). In this pathway, H
approaches nearer to N of thiazole unit in the excited state enol form and further transfer to N leads to the excited
state keto form with N-H bond distance 1.0232 Å and H39-O22 bond distance of 1.9032 Å. The excited state keto
returns to the ground state keto conformer with N-H bond distance of 1.0543 Å and H39-O22 hydrogen bonding
distance 1.6458 Å. As hydrogen approaches to oxygen, the excited state keto hydrogen bonding distances decreases
by 0.2574 Å from 1.9032 to 1.6458 Å and it immediately converts to the ground state keto conformer then to the
ground state enol form.
5. Conclusion
Photophysical properties like absorption, emission and dipole moment of the compounds 1-3 in different
solvents were obtained experimentally [37, 50, 51] and correlated with computational results. Theoretical absorption
and emission of the compounds are in good agreement with experimental results. Structural properties of the
compounds were evaluated for the keto as well as enol form, and the results clearly indicate that ESIPT process is
observed in the present compounds. Photophysical properties of compound 1 were compared with those of
compounds 2 and 3, compound 3 shows red shift for absorption as well as emission with large Stokes shift and good
quantum yields. The % deviation between observed absorption and vertical excitation obtained from computation is
high in the case of compound 3 as compared to compounds 1 and 2. Experimental dipole moment of compound 2 is
in good agreement with the dipole moment obtained computationally as compared to compounds 1 and 3. The
computational methods have been useful for assignments of the absorption and emission and thus lead to more
understanding at molecular level and this is not possible by experiments alone. We hope that our research will be
helpful to future uses of these compounds as they show very good fluorescence properties.
