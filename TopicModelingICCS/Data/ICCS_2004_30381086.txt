Abstract. Within the numerical model proposed in [1] we study the ﬂow
of information on a graph with power-law organization of links and an
emergent superstructure formed by two highly interconnected hubs. The
local search algorithms which navigate transport at each node can use
information in the range of zero, one, and two-nearest neighbourhood of
the node. We show how the ﬂow carried by a particular link is distributed
over graph when range of guided search and posting rate of packets are
varied. The probability density function of the ﬂow is given by a universal
log-normal law, which is determined by the overall packet density in the
stationary traﬃc. However, the distribution becomes unstable when the
traﬃc experiences temporary or permanent jamming.

Introduction

The complexity of structure and function of evolving networks is often expressed
in emergence of topological communities [2,3,4] and functionally connected units,
which are based on the linking properties of the network. The inhomogeneity and
sparseness of complex networks eﬀect dynamic processes that these networks
support. Recent study of traﬃc on networks of diverse emergent topologies [1,
5] revels that functional eﬃciency of a network, however, is not determined by
the network’s topology alone, but it also depends on the microscopic rules of the
dynamics. In particular, in the transport processes on networks the rules which
are adapted to the locally changing networks’ structure lead to more eﬃcient
network performance. In the case of random walk dynamics the inﬂuence of the
structural diversity can be incorporated into search algorithms that navigate the
walkers through the graph [6].
Inhomogeneity on the level of local connectivity of nodes makes possible to
design variety of navigations rules on complex networks. The requirement for
locality of the search is essential for costs reasons. In [1] we have studied two
diﬀerent search algorithms that are guided by locally encountered network structure. It has been found that (a) better guided search leads to better performance
of the network; and (b) the same guided search algorithm performs better on
networks with higher organizational complexity [1]. An example which illustrates
these conclusions is the traﬃc of information packets on the Web-type graph [7]

with the next-near-neighbour (nnn-) search. The network’s output was found to
be 40 times higher than when the rules of random diﬀusion are applied.
These results suggest that in artiﬁcially grown networks, although the topological complexity of the network is essential, the functional units can not be
identiﬁed with topological communities independently on the nature of the dynamic process that the network performs. This motivates study of details of the
network’s activity as it performs a particular type of function. A detailed knowledge about the distribution of activity throughout the network may be then
used as a starting point for restructuring of the network in order to improve its
function at local levels. Another approach of network’s restructuring to optimize
its performance under global condition was suggested in [8].
Here we use the numerical model, which was recently introduced in [1] for
information packet transport on structured graphs, to study the intensity of
traﬃc carried along a particular link (ﬂow) on the cyclic scale-free Webgraph. In
particular, we determine how the distribution of ﬂow depends on the radius of
the area around visited node which is explored by the guided search rules, and
on the packet density.

Network Topology and Search Algorithms

The network which we use here is represented by a directed graph (Web graph)
grown with the microscopic dynamic rules which are proposed in [7] to model the
evolution of the world-wide Web. The rules consist of preferential attachment
and rewiring while the graph grows, which leads to an emergent structure with
inhomogeneous scale-free ordering in both in-coming and out-going links and a
number of closed cycles, as shown in Fig. 1. The statistical properties of the
graph topology are studied in detail [7,9], in particular, the local and global
connectivity, a giant component and clustering (number of triangles per node).
A substantial degree of correlations between in- and out-link connectivity at local
level was found [10] which is characteristic for dis-assortative [2] graph topologies.
Further topological properties—betweenness of nodes and links—are studied by
use of random walk methods [11,2]. An important feature of the Web graph,
which makes it diﬀerent from common scale-free graphs [12] is the emergence of
two types of hub nodes—a node with high in-link connectivity and a node with
high out-link connectivity—which are closely interlinked by a number of short
triangles. The superstructure of interlinked nodes which is associated with the
two hubs appears to play an important role in the transport processes on the
graph [1,13].
The diﬀusion rules for dense traﬃc of packets on the graph are summarized as
follows (see [1] for detailed description and [10] for details of the implementation
of the numerical code):
Packets are created with a ﬁnite rate R at a node and each packet is assigned
an address (destination) where it should be delivered. Both the origin node and
destination node are selected randomly within the giant component of the graph.
The packets are navigated through the nodes by one of the search rules given

below. The priority of move at a node is given according to the “last-in-ﬁrstout” (LIFO) queuing mechanism. When the packet arrives to its destination it
is removed from the traﬃc.
The three local search algorithms which we consider here diﬀer in the range
of area where the search for the destination node is performed in the vicinity
of the visited node. If the node just visited by the packet is not its destination
node, the search performed around that node can be within
– range zero, when the packet proceeds by randomly selecting a neighbour
node on the network;
– range one, where the search for the destination is asked among ﬁrst neighbours of the visited node and, if found, packet is delivered to it, else it
proceeds to a randomly selected neighbour;
– range two, where through all ﬁrst neighbours the signaling to next-nearneighbours (nnn) of the visited node is done; if the message is returned
by a neighbour of the destination node, then the packet is delivered to that
(common) neighbour, else it proceeds to a randomly selected neighbour node.
The packet transport on the same network appears to be markedly diﬀerent
when diﬀerent search algorithm is used. The eﬃciency of the transport measured
by the transit times of packets increases with the range of search. The distributions of the transit times of packets in Fig. 2 show power-law dependences

with diﬀerent slopes and cut-oﬀs for diﬀerent search algorithms. The maximum
transit time increases in the case of less eﬀective search, leading to increased
accumulation of packets in the traﬃc (small output rate) and the network enters jamming regime at much lower posting rate, as compared to the advanced
search algorithms. For shortest transit times T = 1, resulting in the case when
selected pairs of nodes are at unit distance, the search rules with the range one
and range two coincide.

Information Flow Distribution

The topological importance of a particular node on the graph is measured by
betweenness, which is deﬁned as the number of shortest paths between pairs
on nodes on the graph that pass through that node. An analogous property,
betweenness-centrality, is deﬁned for links in the graph theory [14]. Here we
consider a dynamically generalized betweenness-centrality called ﬂow [14], by
which we measure the importance of a particular link for the packet traﬃc on
the graph. The actual paths of packets diﬀer from topologically shortest paths,
being subjected to navigation and queuing processes.
The ﬂow of the traﬃc which is carried by a particular link is given by the
number of packets transferred along that link within given transport process. In

the packet transport between pairs of nodes on the graph we identify the exact
path of a packet and update the ﬂow on each link along the path. Depending
on local network structure and the search algorithm, in the same time interval
and ﬁxed posting rate certain links carry much higher ﬂow compared to the
others. An example is shown in Fig. 1a: the intensity of ﬂow on the links of
the graph is expressed by the increased width of a link (within four bins). The
results for the probability density function of ﬂow along a link on the graph for
diﬀerent situations studied in this work are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 (averaged
over network realizations and log-binned). The distribution appears to be close
to a log-normal law (cf. Figs. 3 and 4).
Fig. 3 demonstrates the inﬂuence that the three search algorithms with different ranges of information have on the probability density of ﬂow carried by
a link for identical posting rates and time intervals. The eﬃcient search algorithm (i.e., with the information range two) removes packets from the traﬃc
quite quickly after their creation. Therefore, although certain links appear to
carry quite large ﬂow, the overall distribution is centered at low mean value.
The location of links with heavy ﬂow on the graph are shown in Fig. 1b for the
case of the most eﬀective search. On the other hand, in the case of less eﬀective
searches, packets remain on the network for much longer time, increasing the
overall packet density. Consequently, the probability of large ﬂow along a link
will increase. The mean value of the distribution is shifted towards increasingly
larger values when the range of the search algorithm is reduced (cf. Fig. 3).

Next we consider the ﬂow distribution in the case of the eﬃcient search
algorithm (i.e., for the searched range in next-near-neighbourhood) for diﬀerent
density of packets. When the number of posted packets increases by increasing
posting rate R within same time interval, the mean of the ﬂow distribution
moves towards higher values, as shown in Fig. 4a. In the conditions shown in
Fig. 4a the traﬃc remains stationary, which can be checked by monitoring the
work-load timeseries [13]. In order to further investigate this eﬀect, we determine
the ﬂow distribution for the conditions when the time interval and posting rate
vary so that the overall number of created packets remains ﬁxed. The results
are shown in Fig. 4b. For the posting rates where the traﬃc is stationary, the
distributions for diﬀerent posting rates collapse. Whereas, the ﬂow distribution
deviates from the universal curve for larger rates when the network experiences
temporary “crisis” [13] which the system manages to clear out within long time
intervals, or when permanent jamming occurs.

Conclusions

The topology of underlying graph plays an important role in the transport processes on networks. For example, the graph with high complexity, as the Web
graph described in Section 2, can carry huge amount of traﬃc before getting
jammed. The detailed analysis of traﬃc in terms of the transit time and ﬂow
statistics reveals the importance of search algorithm in the transport of information packets to speciﬁed destinations on the graph. In particular, the global eﬃciency of the traﬃc is directly correlated with the radius of the locally searched
area around a node in the navigation process. The maximum transit time of
packets decreases by a factor of two to ten when the range of search is increased
from zero- to one- or two-near neighbours of a node. The distribution of ﬂow
along the links changes accordingly with the eﬃciency of the local search. Under the identical other conditions in the less eﬀective local search the packets
accumulation on the network, which leads to generally increased ﬂow along each
link. The mean of the ﬂow distribution moves towards larger values.
On the global level, the probability distribution of ﬂow appears to be close
to a log-normal law. It is unstable with respect to random addition processes,
which in the case of traﬃc is realized in the conditions of increased rate of
packet creation. We ﬁnd that for given (eﬀective) search rule in the stationary
traﬃc the distribution of ﬂow along links of graph is universal when the overall
number of created packets is ﬁxed, independently on the time interval in which
the packets are created. The observed deviations from the universal curve are
correlated with the volatile ﬂuctuations of the packet density (temporary jamming) or permanent jamming in the network. These results are in agreement
with other ﬁndings based on queuing and network-load timeseries analysis [13],
which suggest the occurrence of three distinct phases in the transport on complex graphs: stationary free ﬂow, stationary ﬂow with temporary jamming, and
jammed traﬃc.

In the artiﬁcially grown networks the detailed knowledge of the ﬂow distribution of packet traﬃc for a given search rule can be used to rebuild the network
structure so that it performs that transport process with higher eﬃciency.
