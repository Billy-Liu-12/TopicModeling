Traditional agent-based models accurately approximate the behaviour of simple or simplified natural and manmade systems by mimicking and often bio-mimicking simple entities. They fall short of mimicking the behaviour of
“sophisticated” animals and humans. “Cognitive agents” partially solve this problem by performing “Cognitive
Acts” (i.e., a sequence consisting of all of the following acts: Perceiving, Reasoning, Judging, Responding, and
Learning) as opposed to Agents, who perform “Reflexive Acts” (i.e., Perceiving and Responding).
This workshop running within the framework of ICCS 2010 focuses on current research on theory and
applications of cognitive agents and on the computational intelligence methodologies employed to allow Cognitive
Agents performing Cognitive Acts.
The research described in this workshop includes well constructed toy models “illustrative of issues that arise in
decision situations where different response or behavioural strategies are available but the preferred strategy is
uncertain”, “intelligent cores as a means to achieve fault tolerance in distributed parallel computing systems”, desert
ant navigation modeling, learning and coordination among multiple autonomous distributed cognitive agents, and a
proposal for a hierarchical layered model of the generic cognitive agents in a style akin to the hierarchical OSI 7
layer model used in data communication.
