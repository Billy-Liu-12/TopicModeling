However, the impacts of building geometries and radiation properties on urban thermal
environment are little touched in earlier studies. This study is aimed to identify the effects of building
geometries and radiation properties on urban thermal environment by setting up different cases with
specific configurations.

2 Impacts of building geometries on thermal environment
Impacts of building geometries on urban thermal environment are investigated by configuring
different building geometries, as shown in Table 1. Parameters of building geometry resolution,
building height, verandah height and gap width in between buildings are considered as sensitive
parameters. The 3D building geometries with different combinations of selected sensitive parameters
are shown in Figure 1.
Effects of building geometry resolution are evaluated by comparing cases A, B and C. Effects of
building height and verandah height are studied with cases E, F and G. Effects of gap width are
investigated by comparing case B against case D. In cases A-G, the radiation properties and
thermophysical properties of buildings are set as the material of concrete, whose emissivity and
absorptivity are 0.7, transmissivity is 0, reflectivity is 0.3, specific heat Cp is 750 J/KgK, density is
2240 Kg/m3 and thermal conductivity is 0.8 W/mK. The air temperature range in Figures 2-4 is 30°C31°C, 30°C-32°C, 30°C-32°C, respectively.

By comparing cases A, B and C (Figure 2), it is found that local urban thermal environment is
quite sensitive to the building geometry resolution. The longwave reflected radiation which is trapped
inside the recessed portion of buildings can significantly modified the surrounding urban microclimate
by heating up the air. In case A where the complex building geometries are simplified as boxes, as
adopted in most urban canopy models and simplified CFD models, the hot air inside the recessed area
of buildings is not observed at all. This indicates that oversimplified building geometries in numerical
models will induce underestimation of surrounding air temperature.
The effects of building height on horizontal air temperature distribution pattern are illustrated by
comparing cases E, F and G. It is found the lower the height of building and surrounding verandah is,
the hotter the air at the height of 1m above ground will be. This is mainly due to the concentrated
radiation around low-rise buildings. To identify the effects of different gap width between buildings,
case B is compared with case D. It is found that when the buildings are close to each other, the
combined heating effects of reflected radiations are more significant in the surrounding area.

To identify effects of building geometries on vertical urban thermal environment, vertical air
temperature distribution pattern along South-North and East-West directions are plotted in Figures 3
and 4, respectively. It is found that heat is accumulated near the roof of buildings as radiation is
accumulated from bottom to top. Relatively hotter air is observed near the top tip of the buildings
across all cases. With more detailed building geometries such as in case C, the increased air
temperature in between buildings is well captured, which is missing when the building geometry is
oversimplified as in case A. The higher the building is, the hotter the air at the roof top will be as heat
is accumulated along the building surface upwards due to buoyancy effects of hot air. The gap width
seems does not affect the vertical air temperature distribution pattern so much when comparing case B
with case D in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

3 Impacts of radiation properties on thermal environment
Impacts of building radiation properties on urban thermal environment are identified with different
configurations of building radiation properties, as tabulated in Table 2. The corresponding radiation
properties are set for all regions of buildings in Figure 5. A real 24-storey high building of Kent Vale
buildings is chosen, which is the staff housing apartments of National University of Singapore. Five
cases can be compared with the base case where buildings are concrete to identify respective effects.
The air temperature range in Figures 6-7 is 28°C-31°C.

Effects of building radiation properties on horizontal urban thermal environment are illustrated by
plotting horizontal air temperature distribution pattern at the height of 1m above ground, as shown in
Figure 6. It is found that absorptivity of building materials dominates the effects on thermal
environment when comparing cases 1-5 with the base case. When absorptivity is turned off in cases 4
and 5, the heating effects of buildings on surrounding air is negligible, as shown in Figure 6. In other
words, urban thermal environment can be improved by increasing reflectivity of building surface
materials, as indicated in cases 1 and 3. It seems that emissivity of building materials does not
contribute that much to the improved urban thermal environment when comparing case 1 with case 2.

Effects of building radiation properties on vertical urban thermal environment are identified with
vertical air temperature distribution pattern along South-North direction for all cases in Figure 7.
Similar to the effects on horizontal thermal environment, absorptivity is still the predominant factor in
determining the vertical air temperature distribution pattern. The higher the reflectivity of the building
surface material is, the cooler the surrounding urban thermal environment will be, as observed in cases
1 and 3.

4 Conclusions and future work
The impacts of building geometries and radiation properties on urban thermal environment are
identified with configurations of different cases. It is found that accurate and detailed building
geometries help to improve the accuracy of simulated urban thermal environment, as it can capture the
more than 1°C hotter air temperature around the roof top of higher buildings and low-rise buildings.
Absorptivity of building surface materials contributes most to heat up the surrounding air, as it will
induce around 3°C hotter thermal environment. To improve the urban thermal environment, a new
material of low absorptivity and high reflectivity could be developed.
In the near future, it is recommended to employ high resolution 3D cities models as input to
simulate urban microclimate to ensure simulation accuracy. A design-simulation loop tool could
possibly be created to evaluate different countermeasures to improve urban thermal environment.
