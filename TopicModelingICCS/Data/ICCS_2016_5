Abstract
Exp losion fro m an anti-tank mines or imp rovised explosive devices are recognized as one of the lethal
threat towards occupants inside an armoured vehicle. The detonation of these threats creates high
intensity blast waves that were transmitted to the occupant through vehicle structures and seats.
Minimizing the occupant’s casualty can be achieved by properly dissipating the shock waves exerted
to the vehicle. It is important to distinguish the contributing factors that affectted the behavior of the
blast wave so that proper reduction on the shock waves can be achieved. In this paper, three factors
such as occupant seating height, charge weight placement and the Hopkinson-Cran z b last scaling were
studied using numerical simu lations. Design of experiment (DOE) was utilized to determine the ranks
and interactions between each factor fro m the most influential on the results to the least affects
towards the results. Fro m the results it was found that the seating position play s a significant ro le in
reduction of the shock response towards the finite element dummy model.

1 Introduction
Typical land mines weights approximately 9 kg and during its detonation, the exp losive releases
large impu lses that could deform and its shrapnel can penetrate the vehicle structures. In Iraq, 60% of
casualties were known fro m imp rovised exp losive device (IED) (Hannah Fischer, 2009; Galarneau et
al., 2008). The impulse generated fro m the explosion transfers to the occupant through mediu ms that
are connected to the occupants such as the floor sections and seats. This type loading must be
attenuated to a certain value and if failed, fatalit ies may occurs to occupants (Tabiei & Nilakantan,

Khalis et al.

2007). There are several studies of blast related shock waves response to vehicle occupants in order to
better understand the fundamental o f b last related injuries . One of the methods to study the blast wave
phenomena is by using actual experiment. Vlahopoulus et. al (Vlahopoulos & Zhang, 2010) and
Dooge et. al (Dooge et al., 2011) fabricated a capsule and studied the occupant response by applying
explosive charge to the capsule. Ho wever, the actual experiment is well known for its high costing and
safety hazardous. Another examp le of experimental procedure is using a sled test. Sled test was
conducted by sliding amount of weight with initial velocity towards the dummy undercarriage, thus
creating and impulse that near mimics to the blast wave impu lse as reported by Arepally et. al
(Arepally et al., 2008), Bir et. al (Bir et al., 2008) and Bailey et al (Bailey et al., 2013). This type of
experimental cost less than the actual blast experiment, however produces reliable results at the lower
extremities reg ion. Nu merical simu lation is another alternative that is usually used to study the
occupant responses in blast event as reported by Sławiński et. al (Sławiński et al., 2013) and Panowicz
et. al (Panowicz et al., 2010). Nu merical solution offers simp ler and economical solutions but the
computed results obtained must be validated with experimental setup to increase its reliability.
In this paper, the factors that can be used to attenuate the shock waves are studied. The three
factors studies are the finite element dummy model seating height, explosive weight placement and the
Hopkinson-Cran z b last scaling. First, a capsule was designed for the du mmy placement. The design
took consideration of the clearance height of a SIBMAS Armo red Fighting Support Vehicle (AFSV)
which is a wheeled armored personal carrier. Next , the capsule was simulated with 6 kg of exp losive
blasts and the result was validated with the work fro m (Sławiński et al., 2013). After the model was
validated, a design of experiment (DOE) method using numerical simu lation was performed in order
to study the shock response of three selected factors. A full factorial design with three factors and one
center point was selected. Results fro m the DOE are ab le to d istinguish the significant factors that can
reduce shock loading towards the vehicle occupants .

2 Methodology
2.1 Model Validation
In this study, LS-DYNA 3D fin ite element software package was used to develop the simu lations
model. Simu lation of the blast loading is achievable using various methods available in LS-DYNA
3D, for example CONW EP and LOA D_BLAST_ ENHANCED keyword functions . A capsule model
was developed to fit an anthropometric test device (ATD) inside the capsule. The ATD chosen was the
HYBRID III 50th percentile rigid dummy develops by LSTC Corporat ion. Figure 1 shows the capsule
model with du mmy inside the capsule. The overall dimension of the capsule is 2400 x 1410 x
2363mm. The capsule and the seat were meshed into two separate parts so that the seat configuration
can be altered. The capsule and seat were selected with Type 16 shell formulat ion in LS-DYNA 3D
SECTION_SHELL card. The Type 16 shell formu lation is considered accurate and has the ability to
remain stable under unfavorable conditions such as unsatisfactory shapes of element and large
deformation. However, th is type of shell formu lation will increase the total computation time for the
simu lation. Fo r the exp losive loading, 6 kg TNT was placed 400 mm below the capsule floor. Setup
for the LOAD_BLAST_ENHANCED is shown in Table 1.

The LOAD_ BAST_ ENHANCED card units such as unit of mass (CFM), length (CFL), time
(CFT) and pressure (CFP) is converted to kg, mm, ms and GPa respectively wh ich is similar to the
pre-set unit of the Hybrid III fin ite element dummy model. The simulation was set up with gravity
settling time just before the explosive detonation occurs, hence the time of detonation (TBO) is set to
10 ms. The result of the simulation and its validation is shown in section 3.0

2.2 Design of Experiment
After validating the simulat ion, design of experiment (DOE) method was applied to study three
factors that are set up in the simulat ion. Fu ll factorial design with three factors was selected. The
factors are blast scaling, seating height and charge weight position. The blast scaling factor was
adjusted according to the Hopkinson-Cranz scaling law as shown in Equation 1:

Z

R
W

(1)

Where R is the stand-off distance, W is the scaled explosive weight (TNT equivalent) and Z is the
scaled distance between the explosive and the capsule floor. Table 2 shows the minimu m and
maximu m value for each three factors to be set up in the DOE analysis.
The blast scaling value was inversed to 1/Z so it is easier in the DOE analysis where the minimu m
value of 1/Z has the smallest value of charge weight of 0.75 kg and the maximu m value of 1/Z has the
largest value of charge weight of 1.25 kg. Both of the values have the same charge weight d istance of
200mm. The blast scaling was also selected so that the empirical formu la produced fro m the DOE
analysis is useful across wide range of charge weight mass as long as it is align with TNT equivalency.
For the seating height factor, the dummy was placed on a seat where both of its feet are in contact
with the capsule floor section. While for the maximu m value, the dummy was placed on a seat that is
hanged to the capsule wall. The feet of the dummy is placed 150 mm above fro m the capsule floor.

The seats for both cases were model and meshed as different part fro m the capsule and the welded to
the capsule using CONSTRAINED_ GENERA LIZED_W ELD_BUTT card.
Next, for the charge position factor, the minimu m value is set to 0 mm which is directly beneath
the dummy position and the maximu m value is set to 551 mm to left side of the du mmy. Both cases
have similar explosive positioned 200 mm below the capsule.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Simulation Verification

compared with the studies from (Sławiński et al., 2013) for the result of pelvic accelerat ion which their

Fro m Figure 2 it can be seen that the data for both cases are in agreement for the acceleration curve
trend. However, the difference can be observed at the peak value (negative) for both cases where the
data from (Sławiński et al., 2013) shows higher value than the simulat ion fro m this study. This is due
to the higher explosive weight was applied to their numerical simu lation that gives higher blast
acceleration to the dummy’s pelvic. Figure 3 shows the sequences of the capsule subjected to blast
loading of 6 kg TNT.

Fro m Figure 2 and 3, it can be seen that the dummy is in stable position for about 10 ms due to the
setting of gravity settling time . Next , after the explosive detonation at 10ms, it took the blast wave
about few milliseconds to impact the dummy feet. This can be seen as at the time interval of 11 ms,
the foot began to lift up from the capsule floor at 34.997 ms.

3.2 Factors from Design of Experiment
A full factorial design method was selected in order to study the blast acceleration response based
fro m the three contributing factors . In Table 3, the results obtained from each simulat ion cases are
shown. The responses to be evaluated for each simulation are the results from head, pelvic, foot
acceleration and also the tibia force.

Pareto chart obtained from the DOE are useful to evaluate the effects of each factors towards the
simu lations result. Figure 4 shows the Pareto chart for of the Standardized Effects for each result s. It
can be seen that, in all four results, the most dominant factor are the seating height factor (B), followed
by charge position (C) and the interaction between seating height and charge position (BC) in the
factors dominancy arrangement. However fo r tibia results, the BC interaction factor is still below the
standard deviation line, which means that this factor can be neglected for the tibia results.
The seat height indicates a significant response in reducing the b last acceleration because of the
distance that the blast wave required to travel before impact ing the dummy. The larger the distance,
the smaller blast impact would be transmitted to the dummy. Furthermore, the hanging type which is
now one of the common seat configuration in armored vehicle, is useful as it keeps the dummy clear
off from any contact from the capsule floor, thus reducing the impact acceleration
Next, the interactions between each factor were studied. Figure 5 shows the interaction plots for
blast scaling against seat height and seat height against charge position interactions. Fro m each results,
the interactions of blast scaling and seat height factors does not show significa nt interactions as both
of the min imu m and maximu m setting forms a line which is close to parallel lines. The most
significant interactions are formed by the seat height and charge position factors. This can be seen in
the graph for the head, pelvic, foot and tib ia results, where setting the seat height to 0 mm and then
changing the charge position fro m 0 mm to 551.0 mm would produce significant difference in the
results. However setting the seat height to 150 mm and then changing the charge position to 0 mm to
551.0 mm would produce almost similar results.

4 Conclusion
A numerical simulat ion of a fin ite element du mmy response when subjected to blast loading was
modeled and verified. Th is model was then used in a design of experiment to study the significant
factor affecting the blast impact on the dummy. The result shows that the seat height factor has high
impact on the results. The interaction between two factors that is significant to the simulation results
are the interaction between seating height and charge position factors. Identifying these significant
factors is important so that any imp rovement to reduce the blast acceleration could be done according
to these factors and the improvement would yield better results.
