Abstract
In this work, simulations with scalene triangle meshes represented by a recently proposed graphbased adaptive mesh reﬁnement technique are described. Previously, simulations exclusively
with isosceles right triangles were presented with this graph-based scheme. This data structure
represents triangular meshes in ﬁnite-volume discretizations in order to solve second-order partial diﬀerential equations. The main advantages of using this graph-based adaptive triangular
mesh reﬁnement technique are that low computational cost to adapt and traverse the mesh and
low computational storage cost are achieved. This paper is a result of a work in modeling the
Laplace equation with scalene triangles.
Keywords: Adaptive mesh reﬁnement, mesh generation, non-conformal mesh, elliptic boundary value

Introduction

Development of methods to control and adjust level of details of a data set is a very active
research area. This occurs mainly because of the growing need of analysis and visualization of
details of complex data sets, such as geometric shapes, geographic models or volumetric scalar
ﬁelds [3].
De Floriani et al. [3] also explain that many applications require operations of data extraction in real time or at least on-line for structures that in general have complicated geometries.
Requirements of performance and scalability impose several challenges in the design of a system
of this nature. In general, a better approximation to the solution is directly proportional to the
computational and storage costs of the solution. Taking scalability into account, one needs to
balance these characteristics to ﬁnd a generic and ﬂexible model. Generally, the choice of the
data structure depends on the application, expected performance, data size and operations to
be performed. In particular, triangles are easier to be stored than more complicated polygons.
Adaptive mesh reﬁnement techniques associated to ﬁnite volume discretizations are frequently applied to concentrate more polytopes in speciﬁc regions than in other regions of the
mesh. Certainly, inserting properly more polytopes only in speciﬁc regions of the mesh must

preserve the accuracy of the solution with the beneﬁts that low computational and storage costs
are attained. This occurs mainly because the resulting linear system is smaller when applying
an adaptive mesh reﬁnement technique than when employing a mesh reﬁned uniformly. Furthermore, adaptive mesh reﬁnement is a very active ﬁeld of research; recent examples include
the works by Bryan et al. [2], Kopera and Giraldo [9], Fakhari and Lee [4], and Gonzaga
de Oliveira and Kischinhevsky [7]. Gonzaga de Oliveira et al. [6] recently proposed a graph
to represent the adaptive triangular mesh reﬁnement in the ﬁnite volumes discretizations of
second-order partial diﬀerential equations. The main advantages of using this graph are that
low computational cost to adapt and traverse the mesh and low computational storage cost
are achieved. On the other hand, the triangle shapes aﬀect accuracy and Gonzaga de Oliveira
et al. [6] presented simulations exclusively with isosceles right triangles; they did not show if
other types of triangles could be used with this set of techniques for discretizations of secondorder partial diﬀerential equations. In this present work, the Laplace equation is solved by this
scheme: ﬁnite-volume discretizations and this graph-based adaptive mesh reﬁnement; however,
scalene triangles are used instead of isosceles right triangles.
Section 2 gives details about the scheme developed in this work. The experiments performed
are addressed in Section 3. Final remarks are shown in Section 4.

Scheme development

Likewise carried out in Gonzaga de Oliveira et al. [6], hanging nodes are allowed and, consequently, non-conformal meshes are allowed in the ﬁnite volume discretizations used in this
work. Furthermore, scalene-triangular meshes are dynamically generated and the mesh generation depends on the simulation. Moreover, quality of the scalene-triangular control volumes is
controlled by the algorithms of the adaptive mesh reﬁnement and the meshes remain smooth.
Furthermore, similarly to performed by Gonzaga de Oliveira et al. [6], during the adaptive mesh
reﬁnement process, the four triangle longest-edge (4T-LE) partition [11] is applied. However,
since a space-ﬁlling curve was not applied in this mesh, the graph vertices that represent the
control volumes are ordered by the Cuthill-McKee reverse algorithm [5].
Including, linear system solvers based on the minimization of functionals can be easily applied in conjunction with the set of techniques. Speciﬁcally, the Jacobi preconditioned conjugate
gradient method [8, 10] was employed.
Additionally, the same cell-centered triangular ﬁnite-volume approximation applied in Gonzaga de Oliveira et al. [6] was used. It is an extended ﬁnite-volume approach proposed by
Schneider and Maliska [12] for the solution of PDEs with low computational cost.

Experiments

Let’s consider the Dirichlet problem given by ∇2 φ = 0 in Ω ∈ R2 , φ = f on ∂Ω, where φ is the
dependent variable of the partial diﬀerential equation, Ω is a limited domain in R2 , and f is
a deﬁned smooth function on the boundary ∂Ω. This problem is well-posed in the Hadamard
sense [13]. The prescribed boundary conditions were set as f (0, y) = f (x, 0) = f (x, 1) = 10
and f (1, y) = 0. This problem was solved by ﬁnite-volume discretizations and examples of the
generated meshes are shown below. A color map is shown in Figure 1. This color scheme was
used in the meshes generated.
The initial grid is composed of scalene triangles, as exempliﬁed in Figure 2. Examples of
reﬁned meshes composed of 32 (1 reﬁnement level allowed), 119 (2 reﬁnement levels allowed),

449 (3 reﬁnement levels allowed), 1265 (4 reﬁnement levels allowed), 3551 (5 reﬁnement levels allowed), 8194 (6 reﬁnement levels allowed) control volumes are shown in Figures 3 - 8,
respectively.

A reﬁned mesh composed of 13043 scalene-triangle control volumes is shown in Figure 9.
In this simulation, the reﬁnement criterion was set as 0.69 (instead of 0.31 as in the previous
simulations) and 16 reﬁnement levels were allowed; hence, more triangles were concentrated in
the right corners of the mesh.
This scheme using scalene triangles resulted in higher computational cost than the original
isosceles right triangles presented by Gonzaga de Oliveira et al. [6]. However, a feasible computational time was reached; e.g. computational costs to solve some linear system in an Intel R
CoreTM i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz with 8GB of memory are shown in Table 1.

Similarly, the resulting reﬁned mesh of other simulation is shown in Figure 10. In this
simulation, the reﬁnement bound was decreased to 10−14 , instead of 10−9 as used in the previous
simulations. In Table 2, the quantity of triangles per quality in several simulations are shown.

simulations were executed in an Intel R CoreTM i3 CPU 550 @ 3.20GHz with 16GB of memory.
More than 53% of the control volumes are comprised of high-quality triangles, almost 44%
of the control volumes are comprised of medium-quality triangles, and approximated 3% are
low-quality triangles, in these simulations. The low-quality triangles could be reﬁned in order
to improve the quality of the mesh. However, only triangles related to the reﬁnement criterion
were reﬁned in these simulations so that more control volumes are concentrated in the two right
corners of the computational domain due to the boundary conditions applied.

Conclusions

Simulations with a recent graph-based adaptive mesh reﬁnement scheme for discretizations
of second-order partial diﬀerential equations were described. Gonzaga de Oliveira et al. [6]
presented simulations only with isosceles right triangles. Meshes presented by the authors
did not show if other types of triangles as control volumes could be applied with this set of
techniques for ﬁnite-volume discretizations of second-order partial diﬀerential equations. In this
present work, solutions of the Laplace equation by this graph-based ﬁnite-volume discretization
scheme applying scalene-triangle control volumes were shown.
In a future work, other second-order partial diﬀerential equations shall be applied, e.g. heat
conduction and wave equations. In addition, higher-order approximation is intended to be used.
Speciﬁcally, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme shall be applied.
