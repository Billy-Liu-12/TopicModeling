Abstract
Social phenomena are aﬀected by the structure of a network consisting of personal relationships. In this paper,
the diﬀusion of information among people is examined. Especially, we focus on the potential edge for two nodes
that are not connected by an edge and have at least one common neighbor. First, a mechanism in which the potential
edge changes into a real edge is considered and a new network model is proposed. This mechanism determines the
topology of the network and the statistical indicators . Second, the role of a potential edge on the information diﬀusion
is studied by numerical simulations using a simple information diﬀusion model of the networks. Two data mining
methods are used: the neural network predicts the convergence rate and the time by six explanatory variables, and the
decision tree reveals the statistical indicator having the strongest eﬀect on the information diﬀusion. By analyzing the
relationships between the information diﬀusion and the statistical indicators, the role of the potential edge is shown.

1. Introduction
Some diﬀusion processes of information, such as word-of-mouth communication, social decision making, on
so on, are considered to depend on the structure of networks consisting of personal relationships [1, 2, 3]. Recent
studies in network science have shown that such network structures can be derived from the mechanisms of network
organization. For social systems, the mechanisms of network organization, such as linking two nodes according to
fitness [4, 5], growth and preferential attachment [1], vertex copying (including duplication, divergence, and mutation)
[6, 7, 8], transitive linking and the finite age of nodes [9], have been proposed for reproducing some aspect of social
network structures. It is considered that the information diﬀusion process is strongly related to such mechanisms.
However, it is not well known how these mechanisms aﬀect the information diﬀusion.
The influence of these mechanisms on the information diﬀusion has often been studied by numerical simulations
that use the networks created by the mechanism itself. Since it is quite diﬃcult to obtain a direct relationship between
the information diﬀusion and a mechanism of network organization, the relationship is inferred from two relationships:
the relationship between the mechanism and the network structure, and the relationship between the network structure
and the simulation results. In most cases, reproducibility of the network structure is the most important factor for the
process of inference. Especially, the degree distribution is a primary factor that determines the network structure [10].
The abovementioned mechanisms have been successful in reproducing the power-law degree distribution, which
applies the scale-free property. However, insuﬃcient attention has been given to the distributions of low-degree and

high-degree nodes. In many real networks, we observe the co-existence of diﬀerent types of degree distributions.
For example, the degree distributions of real social networks, shown in [11, 12, 13, 14], appear to be a mix of
exponential and power-law distributions. As far as the authors know, Davidsen et al. proposed the first model to
realize the coexistence of exponential and power-law distributions [9]. Although they numerically showed exponential
and spanning scale-free regimes in their model, the mechanism of the network organization was not clear. V´azquez
expanded their model and added the idea that two nodes sharing a common neighbor are more likely to be connected
in the future [15]. He proposed the concept of the potential edge and introduced a mechanism for changing a potential
edge to a real edge. A potential edge represents the relation between two nodes that have one or more common nodes
but do not have an edge between them. He realized the coexistence of exponential and power-law distributions. Since
then, the mechanism for changing from a potential edge to a real edge is considered to play an important role in
forming such distributions [15, 16]. His model is often called the Connecting Nearest Neighbors (CNN) model.
Although exponential and power-law distributions coexist in the CNN model, the distributions of the exponential
and power-law regimes cannot be discriminated. In this paper, we pay attention to this point. First, we propose an
alternative CNN model that can discriminate the two regimes by considering the role of the potential edge. Then,
we attempt to analyze the role of the potential edge on information diﬀusion by numerical simulations. We examine
the convergence rate and the time as two dependent variables. Six statistical indicators representing the characteristic
feature of the network structure are used as explanatory variables. Two data mining techniques, a neural network and
a decision tree, are used to analyze the relationships between the dependent and the explanatory variables.
2. Method
2.1. Network Model
Our proposed model is based on the CNN model. First, we describe the CNN model, composed of the following
two processes.
(i) With probability 1 − u, introduce a new node in the network, create an edge from the new node to a node j
selected at random (implying the creation of a potential edge between the new node and all neighbors of j).
(ii) With probability u convert one potential edge, created in process (i) and selected at random, into an edge.
In the CNN model, only the potential edge created in process (i) is converted into an edge in process (ii). That is, the
potential edges created in process (ii) are neglected. Therefore, we alter the model as follows.
(i) With probability 1 − u, introduce a new node in the network, create an edge from the new node to a node j
selected at random.
(ii) With probability u, convert one potential edge selected at random into an edge.
In this model, potential edges are created in both processes (i) and (ii). Hereafter, we call this the VL model. The
diﬀerence between the CNN model and the VL model is shown in Figure 1. The potential edges created in (i) and (ii)
are denoted as PEV and PE L , respectively. Figure 2 shows an example of the degree distributions of the CNN model
and the VL model.
It is found from Figure 2 that the conversion from PE L to an edge causes the variation of the degree distribution
of the CNN model, which contains PEV only. However, one potential edge in process (ii) of the VL model is not
determined by PEV or PE L . Then we consider the following new mechanism for changing the potential edge to a real
edge.
(i) With probability 1 − u, introduce a new node in the network, create an edge from the new node to a node j
selected at random. A set of PEV is created.
(ii) With probability u, one of the following two processes is performed. In both processes, a set of PE L is created.
(a) With probability q, convert one potential edge of PEV selected at random into an edge.
(b) With probability 1 − q, convert one potential edge of PE L selected at random into an edge.

We call this the qVL model. The diﬀerence between the VL and the qVL models is shown in Figure 3. Figure 4
shows the degree distributions of the qVL model for diﬀerent values of q. For q = 1, the qVL model is equivalent to

the CNN model. As q decreases, the qVL model becomes closer to the VL model. We found that several kinds of
exponential and power-law distributions are realized by the conversion from a potential edge to a real edge.
As mentioned previously, our model is based on the CNN model proposed by V´azquez. The principle behind his
model is that two nodes connected by a potential edge are more likely to be linked in the future. This is assumed
to be true in several real social networks, since the degree distributions can be reproduced by models based on this
principle. However, it is also true that two nodes not connected by a potential edge are sometimes randomly linked.
Yuta et al. called this process a random linkage, and added the random linkage process to the CNN model [16]. We
adopt their model. Here we add a random linkage to our qVL model, as follows.
(i) With probability 1 − u − s, introduce a new node in the network, create an edge from the new node to a node j
selected at random. A set of PEV is created.
(ii) With probability u, one of the following two processes is performed. In both processes, a set of PE L is created.
(a) With probability q, convert one potential edge of PEV selected at random into an edge.
(b) With probability 1 − q, convert one potential edge of PE L selected at random into an edge.
(iii) With probability s, connect one pair of nodes selected at random with an edge. A set of PE Ls is created.
We refer to this as the qsVL model. For simplicity, PE Ls is regarded as PE L in this paper. The schema of process
(iii) of the qsVL model is shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the degree distributions of the qsVL model for diﬀerent
values of s and q. Note that, in the case of q = 1 and s > 0, the model is the same as that proposed by Yuta et al. [16].
In this paper, we use the qsVL model for the simulations.
2.2. Information Diﬀusion Model
The Glauber dynamics of the Ising model, which describes a set of spinlike binary variables and their corresponding local interaction, represents some of the simplest dynamics occurring in complex networks [20]. In this paper,
we adopt this model as the information diﬀusion model. A spin variable σ = ±1 located at the nodes of the network

2.3. Numerical Experiment

Let N be the total number of nodes. In our simulation, the qsVL model generates several networks. We denote a
network generated with a given parameter (u, q, s) as G(u, q, s). The mechanism of network organization in the qsVL
model, described in the previous section, consists of the following four organization rules: A) A new node creates an
edge from the new node to a node j selected at random, B) One potential edge of PEV selected at random is converted
into an edge, C) One potential edge of PE L selected at random is converted into an edge, and D) One pair of nodes
selected at random is linked with an edge. The network G(u, q, s) evolves according to these four rules, and the rules
are selected according to each set of parameters (u, q, s).
The rN nodes selected randomly are assigned the positive spin state in the initial condition (σ(0) = +1), whereas
the remaining(1 − r)N nodes are assigned σ(0) = −1. Here, r is the initial fraction of positive spins. The spins of the
nodes are updated by the above information diﬀusion model.
In this paper, we examine the convergence rate and time for the network G(u, q, s) and the initial fraction of positive
spins r. Let TC and R∞ be the time from t = 0 to the convergence and the ratio of positive spins in the convergence
(convergence rate), respectively. TC and R∞ are obtained by averaging a certain number of runs with respect to a given
(u, q, s, r). One result consisting of (u, q, s, r), TC and R∞ is obtained in every simulation.
2.4. Data Mining
As mentioned previously, the relationship between information diﬀusion and the mechanism of network organization is inferred from the two relationships, one between the mechanism and the network structure, and the other
between the network structure and the simulation result.
In our network model, both the mechanism of network organization, including the role of the potential edge,
and the network structure are related with a set of parameters (u, q, s). However, interpretation of the simulation
results from parameters (u, q, s) is not always straightforward. Previously, in the simulations involving the network

structure and the simulation result, both the quantities used in the simulation and the statistical indicators representing
the characteristic features of the network structure were examined. The quantities and the statistical indicators were
treated as dependent variables and explanatory variables, respectively. We follow this approach.
We examine the convergence rate R∞ and time TC as two dependent variables in this study. The statistical indicators and the initial fraction of positive spins r are used as the explanatory variables. It is acceptable for the degree
distribution to become one of the statistical indicators. Since it is diﬃcult to strictly quantify the degree distributions
by mathematical curves, the distributions are represented by the degree variance (σ2 ) [19] and the maximum number
of degrees (kmax ). The total number of potential edges (n pe ) is another statistical indicator. In addition, to use the
knowledge obtained from previous studies describing the relationships between the simulation result and the network
structure, the clustering coeﬃcient (C) [17], the average path length (L) and the assortativity (ras ) [18] are used as
statistical indicators.
In our preliminary experiments, we could not always find explicit relationships between the dependent and the
explanatory variables. So, we extract the structural descriptions from the data by data mining [21]. Two data mining
techniques, a neural network and a decision tree, are used to analyze the relationships for an initial fraction of positive
spins r between two dependent variables (TC , R∞ ) and six explanatory variables (σ2 , kmax , n pe , C, L, ras ).
Let Mr be the dataset of total simulations with respect to r, in which the component is (TC , R∞ , σ2 , kmax , n pe , C, L, ras ).
First, the dataset Mr is divided into Mrt and Mrv randomly. Second, a neural network is trained using Mrt . The neural
network consists of three layers. Let K be the number of units in the input layer. The number K varies according to
the number of variables that are used for the training. We use every combination of the explanatory variables as the
�
input layer. Since the range of K is 1 to 6 in this study, there are 6K=1 6 Ck = 63 combinations of the input layer. In the
hidden layer, six units exist. The output layer has one unit, R∞ or TC . In this way, 126 neural networks are generated.
Third, the neural networks are trained and used for the prediction of R∞ and TC . Let NNlo be each neural network,
where l = 1, 2, ..., 63) and o = 1, 2. NNl1 and NNl2 represent the neural networks for R∞ and TC , respectively. After the
training of the 126 neural networks using the dataset Mrt , R∞ and TC are predicted by NNl1 and NNl2 with the dataset
Mrv .
l
Last, the accuracy of the prediction is evaluated by the measurement index defined below. Let (R˜∞ )i be the
predicted value of R∞ using NNl1 and the i-th data of the explanatory variables in Mrv . The predicted value of TC using
l
NNl2 and the i-th data in Mrv is denoted by (T˜C )i . Let (R∞ )i and (TC )i be the i-th data of the dependent variables in
Mrv . The measurement indices of the accuracy of prediction Flo for NNlo are defined as follows:
2

where Nv is the number of data in Mrv . The prediction becomes more accurate as Flo becomes larger.
The combination of explanatory variables producing the most accurate prediction is known as Flo . However, it
is diﬃcult to know which explanatory variables are dominant for the prediction of R∞ and TC . The decision tree is
used to find the dominant explanatory variables. Let I be the binary vector. The components of I correspond to the
explanatory variables and are denoted as (Iσ2 , Ikmax , Inpe , IC , IL , Iras ). Each component takes 1 if the corresponding
explanatory variable is used as the unit of the input layer, and 0 if not. For example, if clustering coeﬃcient C and
average path length L only are used as units of the input layer, I = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0). The measurement indices of the
accuracy of prediction Flo are computed, and Nv sets of I and Flo are obtained. After that, a regression tree is used.
The predictor and criterion variables of the regression tree are I and Flo , respectively.
3. Experiment and results
The total number of nodes N is set as 10000. In this paper, several networks are created by changing the parameters
s and q. The sum u + s is fixed as 0.8 so that the average degree of each network becomes the same. The parameter
s changes from 0 to 0.75 at intervals of 0.05, and the parameter q changes from 0.05 to 1 at intervals of 0.05. The

parameter r is set as 0.6 for the sake of simplicity. The results shown throughout this report are averaged over 250
simulations.
Figure 7(a) shows the relationship between the parameter s and the convergence rate R∞ with respect to q. Figure
7(b) shows the relationship between the parameter q and the convergence time TC with respect to s. The relationship
between q and R∞ is almost linear in each network. On the contrary, R∞ rises logarithmically when s increases. When
s comes close to 0.75, R∞ is approximately 1 in each network.
Figure 8(a) shows the relationship between s and TC with respect to q. A peak of TC appears when s is approximately 0.1. When s is less than approximately 0.1, TC rises according to the increase of s. However, TC decreases
when s is more than 0.1. TC is approximately 6 when s becomes close to 0.75 in each network. Figure 8(b) shows
the relationship between q and TC . For the networks of s = 0 and s = 0.05, TC increases linearly when q rises. In the
networks where s is more than 0.1, TC decreases according to the increase of q.

In our models, the mechanism of network organization, including the role of the potential edge, the network
structure, and the information diﬀusion, are related with the set of parameters (u, q, s). The influence of the potential
edge on the information diﬀusion was examined with respect to (q, s) .
The parameter q is the probability that the potential edge, which is created when a new node comes into the

network, becomes a real edge. If q is close to 1, it is easier for each node to create edges between the nodes adjacent
to the node that created the first edge. On the contrary, if q is small, all pairs of nodes that are not connected by
an edge and have at least one common neighbor have a similar likelihood that they will be connected in the future.
We call these networks having a high value of q as ”cohesive networks” and networks having a low value of q as
”non-cohesive networks.” The parameter s is the probability that the nodes with a shortest path of two or more than
two nodes between them are connected. If s is high, the network is expected to become close to a random network.
However, if s is close to 0, two nodes that are not connected and have at least one common neighbor are more easily
connected. For the sake of simplicity, we call these edges whose shortest path among them was two or more than two
before they were connected ”short cuts.”
The above results suggest that information is easier to spread widely in a network that has many short cuts.
However, it took longer for the information diﬀusion to converge on the networks with a small number of short cuts
than on the networks with no short cuts. In addition, it was easier for information to diﬀuse widely on a cohesive
network than on a non-cohesive network. In the network with no or a small number of short cuts (s = 0 and s = 0.05),
it was easier for information to converge on a cohesive network than on a non-cohesive network. Finally, in the
network with many short cuts, it was easier for information to converge on a non-cohesive network than on a cohesive
network.
As shown in the previous section, the increase of R∞ according to the rise of s can be interpreted as follows: the
increase of the number of short cuts causes the rise of the convergence rate. However, the interpretation of other
simulation results from the parameters (q, s) is not always so clear.
In this section, the relationships between the simulation result and the network structure are examined by data
mining. In the numerical experiments, 320 data consisting of (TC , R∞ , σ2 , kmax , n pe , C, L, ras ) are obtained for r = 0.6.

R∞ and that of TC are obtained, respectively, by NNl and NNl using M0.6 . At the same time, the measurement indices
of the accuracy of prediction Flo for NNlo are computed. Tables 1 and 2 show the first five Fl1 and Fl2 , respectively,
arranged in order from the largest to the smallest. The combination for the most accurate predictions of both R∞ and
TC is (n pe , L, ras ). Figure 9(a) shows the scatter plot of the actual and predicted values of R∞ for this combination.
Figure 9(b) shows the scatter plot of the actual and predicted values of TC for this combination. Note that the ”actual
value” means (R∞ )i or (TC )i of the i-th data in Mrv . In Figure 9, high correlations are seen between the actual values
and the predicted values with small variance. It is found that the combinations appearing in Table 1 always include
both n pe and L. In contrast, L is always included in the combinations appearing in Table 2.

The top five combinations for predicting TC

The decision tree is used to find the dominant explanatory variables. Figure10(a) shows the explanatory variable
that is important for the prediction of R∞ . The tree is first divided into two parts by IL . The tree is then divided by
Inpe . This indicates that L is the most important among the six variables for predicting R∞ , and n pe is the second most
important variable.
Figure 10(b) shows the explanatory variable that is important for the prediction of TC . Here, IL makes this tree
branch oﬀ into two groups first. L is also the most important variable for predicting TC . The tree is then separated by
IC when IL is 1. However, as shown in this case, it is more eﬀective not to use C for predicting. The most important
group is composed of IL =1, IC =0 and Ikmax =0. This fact suggests L alone is a suﬃcient variable for predicting TC .
From Table 2, it is confirmed that the combination for the second most accurate prediction of TC is L alone. Although

Results of the decision tree of (a) R∞ and (b) TC

4. Conclusions
In this paper, the information diﬀusion among people was examined by the potential edge, which is defined for a
pair of nodes not connected by an edge but having at least one common neighbor. An analysis method of the influence
of the potential edge on the information diﬀusion was developed.
First, a mechanism in which the potential edge changes into a real edge was considered, and the following new
network model was proposed.

(i) With probability 1 − u − s, introduce a new node in the network, create an edge from the new node to a node j
selected at random. A set of PEV is created.
(ii) With probability u, one of the following two processes is performed. In both processes, a set of PE L is created.
(a) With probability q, convert one potential edge of PEV selected at random into an edge.
(b) With probability 1 − q, convert one potential edge of PE L selected at random into an edge.
(iii) With probability s, connect one pair of nodes selected at random with an edge. A set of PE Ls is created.
Second, the influence of the potential edge on the information diﬀusion was studied by numerical simulations using
a simple information diﬀusion model of the networks. Third, using a neural network, we predicted the convergence
rate R∞ and the time TC by the following six explanatory variables: the degree variance (σ2 ), the maximum number
of degrees (kmax ), the total number of potential edges (n pe ), the clustering coeﬃcient (C), the average path length (L)
and the assortativity (ras ). Every combination of the explanatory variables was used as the input layer. Finally, the
accuracy of prediction, evaluated by the measurement indices corresponding to the combinations and a decision tree,
was used to explain which explanatory variable has a strong eﬀect on the information diﬀusion.
As found in the neural network analysis, the combination for the most accurate predictions of both R∞ and TC
is (n pe , L, ras ). As found in the decision tree, L is the most important and n pe is the second most important for the
prediction of R∞ . However, in the prediction of TC , L is dominant.
By analyzing the relationships between the information diﬀusion and the statistical indicators, it was expected
that the role of the potential edge would be revealed. However, the relationships between the potential edge and the
statistical indicators were not suﬃciently clarified by the present analysis method. Consequently, we plan to enhance
our analysis method in a future study.
