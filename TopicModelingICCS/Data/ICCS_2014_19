Abstract
The Web 2.0 is the ultimate manifestation of User-Generated Content systems. Such systems contain
information of different quality levels. This paper proposes how to measure reputation from social
interactions existing in social networks built according to health information. We selected Twitter as a
case study, since retweet function can be compared with spreading information mechanism. We
provided a new methodology to rank trustworthy sources in a network based on retweet ties which can
help authorities and experts about health information on the internet. Additionally, as a secondary
contribution, we also perform a study about the scale free characteristics of the explored retweet
network.

1 Introduction and Motivation
The Web 2.0 is the ultimate manifestation of user-generated content, and therefore, it is more than
a set of new technologies and services. The Web 2.0 allows users to interact and collaborate with each
other in a social communication environment as creators (prosumers) of user-generated content. The
Web 1.0 is about connecting computers and making information available, while Web 2.0 is about
connecting people and facilitating new kinds of collaboration (Kochanek, Xu, & Murphy, 2011).
The Internet can be an important source for people looking for healthcare information and the
number of such internet users has often increased. Notwithstanding, how shall we know which sources
are useful? How shall we be able to separate the bad sources from the good ones (Hu & Shyam
Sundar, 2009; Hughes, Joshi, Lemonde, & Wareham, 2009; Stvilia, Mon, & Yi, 2009; Weaver,
Thompson, Weaver, & Hopkins, 2009). Due to the global characteristics of the Internet, there is no

publisher that gives guarantee for the contents of the page; therefore, anyone can post anything on the
web, regardless of his or her background or medical qualifications.
Many concerns have arisen about the quality of health information consumed online, and its
detrimental effects (Gil & Artz, 2011). Although, recently many initiatives have emerged to support
users that are looking for health information, e.g., many portals use ethical codes, and thus, there is the
concern that such initiatives are either ineffective or even counter-productive (Bernstam, Sagaram,
Walji, Johnson, & Meric-Bernstam, 2005; Eysenbach, 2002).
Health information is determinant to health-related decisions (Kumar, 2011). Patients frequently
complain that information derived from traditional venues does not meet their needs. Driven by this
need, many, if not the most of users, proactively seek information on their own to obtain answers
instead of waiting for their next appointment with the doctor (Boberg et al., 2003). In general, the
users want to know about symptoms, lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, exercise) that can affect the route of
the disease, or if additional tests and treatment is necessary (Wang & Liu, 2007). Since, users act
without professional guidance, they may not have sufficient knowledge and training to assess the
quality of health web content (Eysenbach, 2002).
In this context, the main question here is how reliable the health online information is? Sabater and
Sierra (Sabater & Sierra, 2005) pointed out that there are many significant factors that affect how users
determine trust, e.g., direct experiences and witness information (also called word-of-mouth).
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an approach to assess reputation from source
information in the medical domain. For this purpose, we considered reputation as a measure of quality
of a supposed “reliable source” we used and adapted the available methods, by combining some
metrics which are frequently used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) to evaluate reputation in other
contexts, since to the best of our knowledge, it is the first research that uses SNA to evaluate user
reputation in the medical domain.
The outline of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we establish the problem and we present the
inherent difficulties to measure such reputation in the medical domain considering online information;
Section 3 presents a brief discussion about concepts in Social Network Analysis. Section 4 we present
the main features of Twitter for our study, Section 5 presents the related works. Section 6 explores the
topological characteristics of social network based on retweet. Our data suggests characteristics of a
scale free network. Moreover, in this same section, we present our general formulation to calculate the
rank reputation of an individual in the network; Section 7 presents our main results about rank
reputation of the social network based on retweet studied in our work. Section 8 provides some
conclusions of our results.

2 Problem statement
Internet is frequently used as a source of information on health issues and, the most frequent
reasons to visit medical websites is looking for information about symptoms, diseases, or treatment
(de Boer, Versteegen, & van Wijhe, 2007). Health information available on the internet can be
relatively different from each other. These vary from academic sites, peer-reviewed journals,
governmental sites, health-institutions sites and individual contributions. There is also a large number
of industry-related Web sites disseminating information or selling products or services in a variety of
ways. When we use the Internet in order to obtain health and medical information, serious issues must
be considered. Information obtained from Internet can bring improvements on health care but can also
do harm if it is wrong or even misused. By looking on the bright side, health information is intended to
extract discussion and communication between patient and the primary care physician (Anderson,
2004). By its very nature, i.e., the freedom for publishing, as a consequence, anyone can publish
anything. Hence, there is a risk that such information, due to unawareness or bias, may be inaccurate

365

or ambiguous. In order to tackle this issue, several studies have proposed quality-rating instruments
based on code or technical criteria to evaluate (or categorize) health web sites.
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (http://www.ahrq.gov) - AHCPR proposed a
“Code of Ethics”. The Codes set out ethical concepts that inform the processes of self-assessment and
compliance based on interpretation and specification: Credibility: It must be included the source,
currency, relevance/utility, and editorial review process for the information; Content: The content
must be accurate and completed, and the site must have an appropriate disclaimer that the information
available may be incomplete; Disclosure: The purpose of the site must be informed to users, as well as
any profiling or collection of information associated with the site; Links: It must be evaluated
according to selection, architecture, content, and back linkages; Design: encompasses accessibility,
logical organization (navigability), and internal search capability; Interactivity: includes feedback
mechanisms and ways for the exchange of information among the users; Caveats: It must be very
clear whether the function of website is to market products and services or is a content provider of
primary information. The Health on the Net Foundation (HON - http://www.hon.ch) also proposed a
certification based on a standard conduct code so-called Net Code of Conduct - HONcode. The code is
intended to allow websites to publish more transparent information. The principles of HONcode are:
Authoritative: Indication of the qualifications of the authors; Complementarity: The information
should support, not replace, the doctor-patient relationship; Privacy: It must respect the privacy and
confidentiality of personal data submitted to the site by the visitor; Attribution: To cite the source(s)
of published information; Justifiability: The website must back up the claims corresponding to
benefits and performance; Transparency: To have an accessible presentation, and email contact;
Financial: It must disclosure the identifies of the funding sources; Advertising policy: It must clearly
distinguish the advertising from editorial content. Consumers can access online health information
directly from credible scientific and institutional sources (e.g. Medline, Healthfinder, which have
HONcode) as well as unreviewed sources of unknown credibility (e.g. well-informed individuals
along with quacks and charlatans), and that is the problem. It should be borne in mind that the task is a
particularly complex one. The users must take into account all the standard conduct code (HONcode),
in order to carry out a thorough analysis to assess trust. However, an individual might not be willing to
spend the time and instead make a naïve assessment to arrive at the conclusion whether or not that the
information has credibility.
It's hard for someone who is not a medical professional to make sure that a site provides reliable
health information. There are many questions about reputation that users continuously have to ask: is
there any evidence that the author of the Web information has some authority in the field about which
she or he is providing information? What are the author’s qualifications, credentials and connections
to the subject? With what organization or institution is the author associated? Are there clues that the
authors are biased? Let us suppose that you read an article about Alzheimer written by a doctor on his
blog. If you asking about the source of this article, you may give different answers: “a doctor,” “a
blog,” “a doctor’s blog,” or just “the Internet.” Indeed, evaluating sources when doing research can be
a complex task, even worse when many searching engines (such as Google, Bing and etc..) rank
material according to their “idea of relevance”.

3 Social Network Analysis SNA
SNA is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups,
organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected information/knowledge entities (Jøsang, Ismail,
& Boyd, 2007; Wasserman, 1999; Watts, 2004). A social network is a social structure (a graph of a
more formal point of view) between actors, mostly individuals or organizations.
The recent proliferation of web applications and mobile devices has made online Social Network SN more accessible than ever before. People connect with each other beyond geographical and

timeline barriers, diminishing the constraints of physical boundaries in creating new ties. These ties
can characterize any kind of relationship, friendship, authorship, etc. Users in network publish their
profile, express their interests in any content, and moreover create links to any other users that are
associated along time (Barabási, 2003). Online Social Network (OSN) provides a basis for
maintaining social relationships, for finding users with similar interests, and for discovering content
and knowledge (Antheunis, Valkenburg, & Peter, 2010; Shalizi & Thomas, 2011). Numerous OSN
have emerged, including networks of professionals (e.g., LinkedIn), networks of friends (e.g.,
MySpace, Facebook, Orkut), and networks for sharing specific types of content such as short
messages (e.g., Twitter), diaries and journals (e.g., LiveJournal), photos (e.g., Flickr), and videos (e.g.,
YouTube).
SNA focuses on understanding the nature and consequences of ties between individuals or groups,
i.e. social network. SNA is widely used in social and behavioural sciences, as well as in political
science, economics, organizational science, and industrial engineering (Borgatti, Mehra, Brass, &
Labianca, 2009; Bruns, 2009; Crandall et al., 2010; Dana & Loewenstein, 2003; Dorogovtsev &
Mendes, 2003; Easley & Kleinberg, 2010; Wasserman, 1999; Watts & Strogatz, 1998). The ties
(edges) analysis is the one of several objectives of SNA, depending on the topic of interest:
Psychologists and sociologists have studied friendship ties (Balkundi & Kilduff, 2005; L. C. Freeman,
1996; Granovetter, 1973; Ibarra, 1992; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001), lately other studies
attempt to identify communities of users with similar interests, and within such communities they try
to identify the most “influential” users. Generally speaking, the aim is to aid business and marketing
process (Ahn, Han, Kwak, Moon, & Jeong, 2007; Cai, Shao, He, Yan, & Han, 2005; Cha, Haddadi,
Benevenuto, & Gummadi, 2010; Cosley, Huttenlocher, Kleinberg, Lan, & Suri, 2010; Jianwei, Lili, &
Tianzhu, 2008; Pal & Counts, 2011; Sakaki & Matsuo, 2010; Yamaguchi, Takahashi, Amagasa, &
Kitagawa, 2010; Yu & Singh, 2000).

4 Twitter blogospheres
With the rapidly development of microblogging in recent years, the information diffusion in
microblogging has received a considerable attentions from academic researchers. Microblogging such
as Twitter and Sina Weibo (Chinese microblogging website) has rapidly developed as a recently
emerging service due to its timeliness, convenience and it is a lightweight easy form of
communication and share information. Posts or updates are made by succinctly describing one’s
current status within a limit of 140 characters, known as “Tweets”. These posts are of research interest
because they are where the social interactions are often played out. It must be stressed that there is
strong evidence that people use them to find information (Costa & Sporns, 2006).
The Twitters’ ties are asymmetric, they are formed when a user follow someone, mostly because
they are interested in topics that user publishes. Twitter allows a user to “follow” updates from other
members who are added as “follower”. The “follower” concept, in Twitter perspective, represents the
user who is following you. The “following” concept represents the user who you follow. Twitter user
generally does not require permission to follow other users, and then it does not imply reciprocity.
Twitter follower/following relationships resemble subscriptions to the RSS feeds of Websites more
than friendship ties in Facebook. Twitter, therefore, constitutes a very open social network space,
whose lack of barriers to access, e.g., even non-registered users are able to use Twitter to track
breaking news on their chosen topics, from “World Economic Crisis” to “European Football
Championship”. Twitter social networkers communicate with each other by posting tweets allowing
for public interactive dialogue, if other users like or find its content truly interesting, they repost it or
“Retweet” it. “Retweeting” is a key mechanism for information diffusion in microblogging. By
allowing “Twitterers” to pass on information that they deem interesting, important, entertaining, etc,
retweeting process behaves just like an informal recommendation system.
Furthermore, when

367

Measuring the reputation in user-generated-content ... L.Weitzel, J.P.M.De Oliveira and P.Quaresma

someone “retweet” you, they are giving you a kind of reputation by sharing your post with their own
followers or contacts. Users are more discerning when choosing what or who to retweet whereas not
all tweets are reposted [48]. We selected Twitter as a case of study mostly because of retweet function.
Starbird et al (Starbird, Palen, Hughes, & Vieweg, 2010) argue that people spread information that
they feel or know to be newsworthy through retweeting. They also suggest that members of online
communities use source credibility as a reputation to validate information. Source credibility refers to
a message recipient’s perception of the credibility of an information source. It is defined as the
extension to which an information source is perceived to be believable, competent, and trustworthy by
information recipients (Gil & Artz, 2011).

Kwak and colleagues [48] rank Twitter users’ by popularity. The popularity was estimated by the
number of followers, PageRank and by retweet count. The results show that all top users are either
celebrities (actors, musicians, politicians, show hosts, and sports stars) or news media. They concluded
that, only the number of followers does not reflect the influence of a user. The PageRank results
showed again a list of celebrities on the top of the rank. The third rank approach (by retweet count)
showed not only celebrities on the top but also news and media. From the results, we may conclude
that the applied metrics were accomplished their aim, i.e., it evidenced the node popularity.
Cha et al (Cha et al., 2010) presented an empirical analysis of influence patterns in Twitter. They
compared three different measures of influence: Indegree, retweets, and mentions. They examined
how the three kinds of influential users performed in spreading popular news topics. The Indegree
influence is the number of followers of a user, directly indicates the size of the audience for that user.
Retweet influence, which indicates the ability of a user to generate content with pass-along value.
Mention influence, which measures the number of mentions containing one’s name that indicates the
ability of that user to engage others in a conversation. The authors found that, the most influential
users were: news sources (CNN, New York Times), politicians (Barack Obama), athletes (Shaquille
O’Neal), as well as celebrities (Ashton Kutcher, Britney Spears). The most retweeted users were
content aggregation services (Mashable, TwitterTips, TweetMeme), businessmen (Guy Kawasaki),
and news sites (The New York Times, The Onion). And finally, the most mentioned users were mostly
celebrities.
Jianwei et al (Jianwei et al., 2008) proposed a new measure for characterizing the importance of a
node with tunable parameters based on Degree centrality, Betweenness centrality and Closeness
centrality. They used a Sexual Relation Network of the AIDS (SRNA) as a case of study. The authors
argued that such measure has a stronger adaptability and are more discriminative when compared to
other several centrality measures. It is important to mention, that such study has not clarified the
research usability, the findings, and the meaning of “importance” of a node in the context of an AIDS
network. In Twitter sphere, others measures are also used to rank node importance, such as follower
count, co-follower rate (ratio between follower and following), frequency of tweets (updates), and
measures of second level, for example, who your followers follow and so on (Bongwon, Lichan,
Pirolli, & Chi, 2010; Boyd, Golder, & Lotan, 2010; L. Hong, Dan, & Davison, 2011; T. Hong, 2006;
Weng, Lim, Jiang, & He, 2010; Yamaguchi et al., 2010).

6 Methodology
6.1 Network structure
In this subsection, we present the way to obtain the topological structure of social network based
on retweet. Latest studies show that not only the network structural characteristics indicates the
importance of a node, but also the user’s communication activity, i.e. the exchange of information for
instance via messages, wall posts etc (Cha et al., 2010; Cheung & Lee, 2010; Shen, Syu, Nguyen, &
Thai, 2012; Subbian & Melville, 2011). Therefore, we assume that “Retweeting” function is likely to
be interpreted as a form of endorsement for both the message and the originating user (Weitzel,
Quaresma, & de Oliveira, 2012). Retweet function represents the degree or level of interactions
between users. By considering this feature, we proposed a network structure based on Retweet
weighted ties named Retweet-Network or simply RT-network. Up to our knowledge, this is the first
time that this topological network structure is modelled. We model the RT-network as a direct
weighted graph G RT = (V, E, W) with the following properties:
The set of nodes (denoting the set of users) V = {v1, v2,…}
The set of edges (representing retweet function) E = {e1, e2,…}and
If ∃ edge ek = (vi , vj) ∈ E, i.e., from vi  to vj this means that user vi “retweet” user
The set of weights (characterizing the strength of trust ties) W= {w1, w2,... } and  
    
• The w(ek) is a function defined for edges as follows:
∑ RTv j ) + λ
Equation 1
w(ek ) = (
RTtotal
Where the parameter ∑ RTv is the counted retweets for vj (target user) from a specific source user
•

•
•

j

vi and RTtotal is the total number of retweet of a target user. This fraction denotes how much make a
source user “trust” a particular target user. The parameter λ is a discount rate representing
relationships (follower, following, friendship and no-relationship between source users and target
users). Furthermore, λ intends to discount the weight of the follow phenomenon, since many
celebrities and mass media have hundreds of thousands of followers; it defines smaller values to
relationships that are “follower” or “following” (or both) and higher values when there is no
relationship between users. Artists and celebrities attract a thousand of followers such as Lady Gaga,
Britney Spears, Ashton Kutcher etc. For example, Ashton Kutcher is a classic Twitter celebrity
phenomenon as an example of a star who has totally embraced the idea of Twitter celebrity-dom. In
2009, he became the first Twitter user to have more than one million followers and according to mid2010, he had almost five million followers. Hence, the parameter λ is estimated according to the
findings in Table 1, with regards to the relationships percentages. For our purposes, we set arbitrarily
α according to the follower ratio: if vi is a follower of vj, thus the retweet is the event that is expected
to happen.
λ = 0.1 If a user vi is a follower of vj the parameter λ has lower weight,
λ = 0.9 in all other cases the parameter has higher weight.

6.2 Ranking reputation approach – RaR
Perhaps the most frequently used centrality measures are Degree (Dc), Closeness (Cc),
Betweenness (Bc), and Eigenvector (Ec). Freeman (L. Freeman, 1979) proposed these three centrality
measures. We used ORA software (http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu) that computes such quantities and
therefore let us briefly explain the main aspects of each one them. Bc is based on the shortest paths
between nodes, focuses on the number of visits through the shortest path. In a directed graph, for a

369

Measuring the reputation in user-generated-content ... L.Weitzel, J.P.M.De Oliveira and P.Quaresma

vertex v, we denote the In-Degree Dcin (v) as the number of arcs arriving to v and the Out-degree
Dcout (v) as the number of arcs starting from this node, thus Dc, of course is Dcin + Dcout . The Cc
measures how close a vertex is to all other vertices in the graph. Ec was proposed by Bonacich
(Bonacich, 1972), nodes with high values of Ec are linked to well-connected nodes and so may
influence many others in the network either directly or indirectly through their connections. PageRank
[61] is another common measure, it is generally used to rank WebPages and ultimately to rank
“popularity”. Pagerank is a link analysis algorithm that assigns a numerical weight to each object of
the information network, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the object set. It
is defined as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process whose states are the nodes of the web
graph, it computes the rank of websites by the number and quality of incoming links (Page, Brin,
Motwani, & Winograd, 1999). In order to address the goal of this work and based on the outcomes
above, we defined a new rank approach combining weighted centralities measures that best fit node
importance. Thus, we defined the Rank Reputation - RaRv (see Table 2 – set of results) as follows:
j

n

RaRv j =

∑

i =1

mij ⋅ ωi

Max {mij ⋅ ωi }in=1
n

0 < RaRv j < 1,

∑ω

i

Equation 2
=1, j =1,..., n

i =1

We model Rank Reputation RaRv as a function of (M,ω) with the following properties: M = {m1,
j
m2,…} is a set of centrality measures, such as: Dc, Ec, Prank, Cc, Dcin, Dcout of the node vj, and ω =
{ω1, ω2,…} be a set of non-negative and normalized weights. Given the input directed weighted graph
G RT = (V, E, W) as described herein, the RaR v computes iteratively the reputation. In the first step,
j

for each node vj it is calculated the metrics mi ∈ M. In second step, it is set out arbitrarily the weight ωi
n
∈ ω the estimated weights must follow the condition: ∀ω ∈ω , ω =1 , where ωi = {0.0, 0.1,
i

∑

i =1

0.2,…1.0}, hence, it is possible that ∃ ωk = 0 | mk * ωk = 0 . In the third step, for each node vj it is
computed ∑n mij ωi , thereafter compute RaRv . In the fourth step, we calculate the Map ( RaRv j ) and
i =1

j

in the last step, return de best fit. The parameter Maxout refers to an Map = 100%, which means, the
best fit of user reputation.
Step1: Set out arbitrarily the weight ωi ∈ ω

Step2: For each node vj compute

Step3: Compute RaRv
j
Step4: For each approach compute Map
Map is used to score document retrieval, it is an arithmetic mean average precision over a set of
documents. As its name suggests, it averages precisions at individual ranks. In words, Map considers
the precision at every relevant result in the list, and divides it by the result’s rank; then, the precision is
averaged by dividing the sum of discounted precisions by the total number of relevant results. Which
means, in optimal ranked retrieval system, a set of relevant retrieved documents are given by the top k

370

Measuring the reputation in user-generated-content ... L.Weitzel, J.P.M.De Oliveira and P.Quaresma

retrieved documents. Map is often used as an indicator for evaluating ranked retrieval results (BaezaYates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).
There are several sources of health information in Twitter blogosphere that people today reply on.
We categorize them into following types of services: media, news, celebrities, public health agencies,
public agencies, private health agencies and search engine. We considered “relevant documents”, in
our case, “relevant users”, those that are only public health agencies since they have the ability to
communicate information accurately. For example, if the site receives funding from commercial firms
or private foundations, then the financial dependence has the potential to bias the information
presented. For instance, if the purpose of the information is primarily to sell a product, there may be a
conflict of interest since the manufacturer may not want to present findings that would discourage you
from purchasing the product (Kumar, 2011).
In order to gain insight about our rank approach, we utilize the findings of (Cha et al., 2010;
Jianwei et al., 2008; Kwak, Lee, Park, & Moon, 2010) as a baseline in our study (see Tabled 4).

6.3 Data sampling and scale free characteristics of the retweet network
We analyzed about 152 user profiles randomly chosen and their respective retweets. The data was
acquired only from those who have some health interest, during March/April 2011. From these user
accounts, we achieved 4350 retweet and 1232 user account and then we built the two datasets. The
first dataset have the following fields: user screen name, class of user: target or source (target –
“retweeted” user; source- user who “retweeted” you), number of tweets, number of followers, number
of following, joined date and a short biography. The second dataset with the fields: source screen
name, target screen name, kind of relationship between them (follower, following, friendship (both
relationship), and no relationship), number of counted retweets (i.e., how many times target user is
“retweeted” by a specific source user). The Table 1 provides an overview of datasets basic statistics.
As can be seen, most of relationship is follower and a minority does not have relationship. Most of
user main characteristics are individuals account and blogs respectively. It is about 8% are related to
private healthcare, such as, medical association, non-governmental organization (NGO), and others
non-profit organizations, and 17% are associated to public healthcare, i.e., the government department
responsible for public health issues.

We analyzed the scale free characteristics of networks. First of all, we check the histogram of
degrees and we perform a direct non-linear Levenberg-Marquardt fit (Colizza, Pastor-Satorras, &
Vespignani, 2007) by a power function f ( x) = βx −α instead of to take the slope in the log-log plot.
The reason here is very simple, we have only 1232 users and this method to determine parameters of
power law would not be very precise due to many fluctuations on the tail of histogram with few
points. It is important to mention that the most important point here is to corroborate that α < 3 in
order to make stronger the power law behaviour (scale free characteristics) of the retweet network
considered in our study. From this direct fit, which can be observed in Figure 1 (a) we obtain a very
small exponent, α ≈ 1.66. This value corresponds to a power law with average and second moment
(and therefore also its variance) that cannot be rigorously computed according to definition. The
Figure 1 (b) corresponds to the same fit in log-log scale, i.e., it corresponds to the Figure 1(a) viewed
in log-log scale. On the other hand, we estimate the power law exponent by a strict linear fit,
estimating the slope in log-log scale that is a way intrinsically different than performing a non-linear
fit. This linear fit is shown as Figure 1.

Figure 1: Power law fits: (a) direct power law fit by Levemberg-Marquardt method (non-linear method) (b) The
same plot in log-log scale. The non-linear fit (in red) also was log-log scaled.

Figure 2: Linear fit

In this case we have a very small slope α ≈ 0.95. The fact is that the cloud of points sampled in the
final of the plot should be masking the result. Therefore, we find a third opinion in a more laboured
method: the method of moments. In this case, we compare experimental and theoretical factionary
moments. The kth experimental moment of degrees is given by:

X=

1
n

n

∑x

k
i

Equation 3

i =1

where xi is the degree of of ith node and the kth theoretical moment is calculated by
∞

x k = (α − 1) ∫ x k −α dx =

xk

So we should compare x and

(α −1)
Equation 4
(α − k −1)

we compare the experimental ratios

e( k ) =

theoretical ratios
t (k ) =

=

(α − 2 ) k

with

Equation 5

So we plot e(k) as function of k, with k from 0 to 1, with displacement Δk = 0.1 with plots of t(k) in
the same figure for different α -values. In Figure 3 we show the experimental ratios (points) together
with theoretical ratios (continuous lines) corresponding to different α-values. Numerically we
determine α ≈ 2.37 as our best estimate. Therefore, we can conclude that α must be a number smaller
than 3 corroborating the hypothesis of power law distribution for the degrees. It is also important to
mention that if on the one hand we observe different estimates to the exponents due to large
fluctuations by considering a not so large number of points, on the other hand, all these estimates
corroborate α < 3. This indicates heavy tail characteristics for the degree distribution in our retweet
network corroborating scale free network aspects.

7 Ranking results
The Table 2 illustrates the equations of the 10 best fits results according to the Equation 2 and the
Rank reputation algorithm. We also compute RaR v using the set of basic measures (Bc, Cc, Dc, Ec)
j

in isolation. We found out that even when performed in isolation, the algorithm failed to achieve its
goal, outcomes Map( RaRv ) ranged between 33% and 41%. The best fits are found for M5, M6 and M7
j

considering all records, i.e., all the 1232 nodes.

Table 2: The set of equations – best fit

We also utilize the precision at k or p@k to evaluate the ranking reputation approach. The p@k is
the proportion of relevant documents in the first k positions. This leads to measuring precision at fixed
low levels of retrieved results, such as 10 or 30 documents (Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). In
our study we considered k = 212, representing the 212th position and total number of relevant
documents.

As can be seen in Table 3, the maximum of p@212 was found in M7, approximately equal to 56%.
By comparing the results obtained in two evaluated methods (Map and p@k), the best fit of these two
methods are M7. In order to gain insights about our approach, we additionally employ two others

studies to carry out a comparative analysis. We use, the finding of: Kwak and colleagues research
(Kwak et al., 2010) – the metrics are follower (M11), PageRank (M13) and retweet count (M12); and
Jianwei et al (Jianwei et al., 2008) – the metric is a set of weighted measures (M14, M15). The
findings of the comparative research were compiled Table 4.

8 Conclusions
This paper investigated the rich data structure of social media systems. We utilized the SNA
method to figure out user’s reputation. In our study, reputation has the same meaning of reliable
source of information in medical domains. We consider that, communication structure of Twitter is
determined by two overlapping and interdependent networks – one based on follower-following
relationships, and other relatively short-term and emergent, based on shared interest in a topic or
event, often coordinated by a retweet function. Therefore, Retweet Network must be understood as a
separated part from follower/following Network. We found out some interesting results. The majority
of Twitter accounts are individual or blogs, since this is the proper nature of Web 2.0. Web 2.0 is
driven by participation and collaboration among users, most obviously apparent in social networking,
social bookmarking, blogging, wikis etc.
We also found out that Reputation Rank Approach is responsive to Dcin and Dcout. These metrics
are present in all best-performing results of RT-Network. By contrast, the average precision RTNetwork worst-performing results are those that use the PageRank and Bc. All metrics in isolation
failed in reaching user reputation, specially the Cc and follower count metrics. Almost all measure of
RaRv achieved about 90% of p@10 performance measure. The third rank approach (by retweet count
j

in Table 4) showed not only celebrities on the top but also news and media. From the results, we may
conclude that the applied metrics were accomplished their aim, i.e., it evidenced the “node
popularity. ”
The study gives us a clear understanding of the how measure selection can affect the reputation
rank (especially in medical domain). Choose the most appropriate measure depends on that we want to
represent. The PageRank operate look alike “edges counts” as the “popularity” measures. We noticed
that popularity (or key position in a graph) does not necessarily refer to reputation. The Bc metric is an
important quantity to characterize how influential a node (user) is in communications between each
pair of vertices, it represents a “gatekeeper” between groups node, and yet both metrics failed. By
contrast, the Cc and Dcin metrics fulfilled the rank goal, i.e., in expressing the reputation. The major
contributions of this work were mostly providing a new methodology to rank trustworthy source using
a new network structure based on retweet ties. Our methodology to compute rank and the way to build

the network topology seem to supply an interesting online method to determine user reputation in the
medical domain. Moreover, we also verified that in Twitter community, trust plays an important role
in spreading information; the culture of “retweeting” seems to have a good potential to reach trust. For
future work we will conduct a study to evaluate other social media that uses similar mechanism, based
on endorsement approach. We verified that trust plays an important role in spreading credible
information.
