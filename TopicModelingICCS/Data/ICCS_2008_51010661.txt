Abstract. Time dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence in recently
discovered cyclic antenna units of the BChl photosystem is modeled. Interaction with a bath and a static disorder here modeled as uncorrelated
Gaussian disorder in the transfer integrals is taken into account. Parallel computer enviroment is used because one is forced to recalculate
every physical quantity for several thousands of diﬀerent realizations of
disorder. Results for the ring LH4 with radial optical transition dipole
arrangement are compared with those for the ring LH2 with the tangential one. The diﬀerence between LH2 and LH4 results for the static
disorder in transfer integrals has an opposite sign in comparison with
that one for the static disorder in local energies. Equivalent diﬀerences
are shifted to a smaller times for the stronger interaction with a bath.

Introduction

The most common antenna complexes in purple bacteria are the light-harvesting
complexes LH1 and LH2. Some bacteria express also other types of LH complexes
such as the B800-820 LH3 complex in Rhodopseudomonas acidophila strain 7050
or the B800 LH4 complex in Rhodopseudomonas palustris [1]. The general organization of the LH2 and LH4 complexes is the same: a ring-shaped structure
is formed from cyclically repeated identical subunits. However, the symmetries
of these rings are diﬀerent: LH2 and LH3 are usually nonameric but LH4 is octameric. The other diﬀerence is the presence of four bacteriochlorophyll (BChl)
molecules per repeating unit in LH4 rather than three ones found in LH2 and
LH3. The most striking diﬀerence is the occurrence of an additional Bchl-a ring
in the LH4 complex, the B800-2 ring, at a position approximately halfway between the densely packed B-a/B-b ring and the B800-1 ring that are both also
present in LH2 [1]. In LH2, the B850 ring has nearly tangentially oriented Bchl-a
pigments, whereas in LH4 the equivalent B-a/B-b pigments are organized in a
more radial fashion.

We are therefore dealing with ring-shaped units with nonameric and octameric
symmetry resembling those rings from antenna complexes LH2 and LH4 with
a strong interaction J (in the range 150 − 450 cm− 1) between BChl molecules.
Our theoretical approach therefore considers an extended Frenkel exciton states
model.
Despite intensive study, the precise role of the protein moiety in governing the
dynamics of the excited states is still under debate [2]. At room temperature the
solvent and protein environment ﬂuctuate with characteristic time scales ranging
from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. The dynamical aspects of the system are reﬂected in the line shapes of electronic transitions. To fully characterize them and
thereby the dynamics of the system, one needs to know not only the ﬂuctuation
amplitude (coupling strength) but also the time scale of each process involved.
The observed linewidth reﬂects the combined inﬂuence of static disorder and
exciton coupling to intermolecular, intramolecular, and solvent nuclear motions.
The simplest approach is to decompose the line proﬁle into homogeneous and
inhomogeneous contributions of the dynamic and static disorder. Yet, a satisfactory understanding of the nature of static disorder in light-harvesting systems
has not been reached. In the site excitation basis, static disorder can be present
as in diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements as in oﬀ-diagonal ones.
Time-dependent experiments [3,4] led for the B850 ring in LH2 complex to
conclusion that the elementary dynamics occurs on a time scale of about 100
fs [5,6,7]. For example, depolarization of ﬂuorescence was studied already quite
some time ago for a model of electronically coupled molecules [8,9]. Rahman et al.
[8] were the ﬁrst who recognize the importance of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix
elements (coherences) [10] which can lead to an initial anisotropy larger than the
incoherent theoretical limit of 0.4. Already some time ago substantial relaxation
on the time scale of 10-100 fs and an anomalously large initial anisotropy of 0.7
was observed by Nagarjan et al. [5]. The high initial anisotropy was ascribed to a
coherent excitation of a degenerate pair of states with allowed optical transitions
and then relaxation to states at lower energies which have forbidden transitions.
Nagarjan et al. [6] concluded, that the main features of the spectral relaxation
and the decay of anisotropy are reproduced well by a model considering decay
processes of electronic coherences within the manifold of the excitonic states
and thermal equilibration among the excitonic states. In that contribution the
exciton dynamics was not calculated explicitly.
In several steps [11,12,13,14,15,16,17] we have extended the former investigations by Kumble and Hochstrasser [18] and Nagarjan et al. [6] for LH2 rings.
We added the eﬀect of dynamic disorder by using a quantum master equation in
the Markovian [11] and non-Markovian limits [13,14]. We also investigated inﬂuence of four types of the uncorrelated static disorder (Gaussian disorder in local
energies, transfer integrals, radial positions of BChls and angular positions of
BChls) [12,15,16,17]. Inﬂuence of correlated static disorder, namely an elliptical
deformation of the ring, has been also investigated [11].
Recently we have investigated the time dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence for newly discovered type of the molecular ring, the LH4 ring with

Computer Simulation of the Anisotropy of Fluorescence

the uncorrelated static disorder in local energies [19]. Main goal of our present
investigation is the comparison of the time dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence after an impulsive excitation for two molecular rings: for molecular
ring with tangentially arranged optical transition dipoles rt (t), like in LH2, as
well as for the radially arranged one rr (t) like in LH4 [1]. We concentrate on the
uncorrelated static disorder - Gaussian disorder in transfer integrals.

an impulsive excitation [18]. The Hamiltonian of an exciton in the ideal ring

approximation. The phonon creation and annihilation operators are denoted by
b†q and bq , respectively. The last term in Eq. (1), Hex−ph , represents the exciton–
bath interaction which is assumed to be site–diagonal and linear in the bath
coordinates. The term Gm
q denotes the exciton–phonon coupling constant.

All of the Qy transition dipole moments of the chromophores (BChls B850) in
a ring without static and dynamic disorder lie approximately in the plane of the
ring and the entire dipole strength of the B850 band comes from a degenerate
pair of orthogonally polarized transitions (at an energy slightly higher than the
transition energy of the lowest exciton state (LH2), slightly lower than the one
of the highest exciton state (LH4)).

of suﬃciently wide spectral range will always prepare the same initial state, irrespective of the actual eigenstates of the real ring. After impulsive excitation

All details of calculations leading to the time convolution-less dynamical equations for ρ(t) are given elsewhere [14] and we shall not repeat them here. Obtaining of the full time dependence of δΩ(t) is not a simple task. We have succeeded
to calculate microscopically full time dependence of δΩ(t) only for the simplest
molecular model namely dimer [21]. In case of molecular ring we should resort

to some simpliﬁcation [14]. In what follows we use Markovian version of Eq. (9)
with a simple model for correlation functions Cmn of the bath assuming that
each site (i.e. each chromophore) has its own bath completely uncoupled from
the baths of the other sites. Furthermore it is assumed that these baths have
identical properties [3,22]. Then only one correlation function C(ω) of the bath
is needed
Cmn (ω) = δmn C(ω) = δmn 2π[1 + nB (ω)][J(ω) − J(−ω)].

Here J(ω) is the spectral density of the bath [22] and nB (ω) the Bose-Einstein
distribution of phonons. The model of J(ω) often used in literature is
J(ω) = Θ(ω)j0

and has its maximum at 2ωc .

Numerical Solution

For the time propagation of the density matrix ρ (Eq. 9) the short iterative
Arnoldi method [23] as well as the standard Runge-Kutta scheme have been
used. An advantage of the ﬁrst one with respect to the second one is the low
computational eﬀort for moderate accuracy [24]. Furthermore, the expansion
coeﬃcients are adapted at each time to a ﬁxed time step with a prespeciﬁed tolerance in contrast to the Runge-Kutta scheme in which the time step is adapted.
An uniform time grid is important for averaging of various realizations at the
same time points without interpolation. The realization averaging and the orientational averaging can easily be parallelized by means of Message passing interface (MPI). Some computations were performed on a PC cluster. So instead of
running about 10 000 realizations on one node, 312 realizations can be calculated
on each of the 32 nodes (or 52 realizations on each of 192 nodes).
Results of our simulations are presented graphically in the next section. We
use dimensionless energies normalized to the transfer integral J12 = J and the
renormalized time τ . To convert τ into seconds one has to divide τ by 2πcJ
with c being the speed of light in cm s−1 and J in cm−1 . Estimation of J varies
between 250 cm−1 and 400 cm−1 . Our time unit (τ = 1) corresponds for these
extreme values to 21.2 fs or 13.3 fs.

Results

Molecular ring is common shape of many antenna units in bacterial photosynthetic systems. They diﬀer by number of BChl molecules, orientation of their
optical transition dipoles, interchromophor distance, etc. We present graphically
results of our modeling for time dependence of the ﬂuorescence anisotropy in recently discovered cyclic antenna unit of the BChl photosystem, namely in LH4

with radial optical transition dipole arrangement. The transition dipole arrangement has a pronounced eﬀect on the strength of the interaction J between BChl
molecules. The width of the exciton energy band of the ideal ring is two times
larger for the tangential arrangement as in LH2 in comparison with radial arrangement in LH4. Also signs of J are opposite in both conﬁgurations. Optically
accessible exciton states in ideal rings are near the bottom (upper) edge of the
exciton band in LH2 (LH4) respectively.
The time dependence of ﬂuorescence anisotropy (Eq. (7)) has been calculated
using dynamical equations for the exciton density matrix ρ to express the time
dependence of the optical properties of the ring units in the femtosecond time
range. Details are the same as in Ref. [14,15,16]. Substantial relaxation on the

observed. Nagarjan et al. [6] suggested a model considering decay processes of
electronic coherences within the manifold of the exciton states and thermal equilibration among the excitonic states. He supposed (without explicit calculation
of the exciton dynamics) that this model reproduces well main features of the
spectral relaxation and the decay of anisotropy in cyclic molecular units.

Let us look at time decay of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence in the molecular
ring with radial arrangement rr (t) - LH4, octameric one. Recently we discussed
[19] results in the case of one type of the static disorder - uncorrelated Gaussian
disorder in the local energies.

In the present paper we concentrate on other type of the static disorder, the
Gaussian uncorrelated disorder in the transfer integrals J, characterized by ΔJ .
In Fig. 1. there is the time dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence in case
of the pure static disorder in transfer integrals for diﬀerent ΔJ . It is seen that
the pure static disorder ΔJ = 0.2 leads to decay of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence
from 0.7 to 0.4 within τ = 20.
Inﬂuence of the pure dynamic disorder, for two its strengths j0 and diﬀerent
maxima 2ωc of the spectral density function J(ω) is shown in Fig. 2. Dynamic
disorder has a pronounced eﬀect mainly in case of lower ωc .
Consequences of the combined static and dynamic disorder are presented in
Fig.3. The time dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence is displayed on
four 3D graphs for two strengths of interaction with the bath and two maxima
2ωc of the spectral density function. While for ωc = 0.1J the inﬂuence of the
static disorder is secondary due to dominance of the dynamic disorder, for larger
ωc = 0.3J the inﬂuence of the static disorder is more pronounced.
Comparison of the time dependence of ﬂuorescence anisotropy for the octameric ring with radial arrangement of optical transition dipoles (like in LH4)
and for the nonameric one with tangential arrangement of optical transition
dipoles is presented graphically as diﬀerences rt (τ ) − rr (τ ) in Figs 4-6.

Conclusions

The diﬀerence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence between the nonameric tangentially arranged ring rt (τ ) and octameric radially arranged one rr (τ ) for the static
disorder in transfer integrals (Fig. 4) has an opposite sign in comparison with
the result for the static disorder in local energies as shown in Fig. 2 in [19].
For the inﬂuence of the dynamic disorder (interaction with the bath), given
by Eqs(9-11), we can conclude (Fig. 5) that the same diﬀerences are shifted to
a smaller times for the stronger interaction j0 .
Similar conclusion can be drawn for the case of simultaneously acting static and
dynamic disorder (shown in Fig. 3 and 6). We can also see more rapid decay of the
anisotropy of ﬂuorescence due to dynamic disorder in nonameric ring for smaller
values of ωc (ωc = 0.1 J) (negative diﬀerence) and in octameric ring for larger
values of ωc (ωc = 0.3 J) in presence of static disorder in transfer integrals (Fig. 6).
