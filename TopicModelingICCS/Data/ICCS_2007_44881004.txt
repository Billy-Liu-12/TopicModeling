Introduction

Wavelets have widely been studied from a theoretical point of view for its many
interesting properties, mainly related with multiresolution analysis such as generating orthonormal basis in L2 (R) as well as for the fact that they have proven
to be extremely useful in many applications such as image processing, signal
detection, geophysics, medicine or turbulent ﬂows. More mathematically focussed diﬀerential equations and even non linear problems have also been studied
with wavelets. Very often wavelets are compared with the Fourier basis (harmonic functions), however the basic diﬀerence is that the harmonic functions
are bounded in the frequency domain (localized in frequency) while wavelets
are bounded both in space and in frequency. Nevertheless a major drawback
for wavelet theory is the existence of many diﬀerent families of wavelets, giving
some arbitrariness to the whole theory. Among the many families of wavelets
the simplest choice is the one based on Haar functions. Despite their simplicity
Haar wavelets have proven their suitability for dealing with problems in which
piecewise constant functions or functions with sharp discontinuities appear. The
scaling function is the box function deﬁned by the characteristic function χ[0,1]
and its Fourier transform, up to constants or phase factor, is a function of the

sin(πt)
, also called sinc-function. By exchanging the role of the variable
type
πt
and frequency space, i.e. assuming as Fourier transform the box function and the
sinc-function in the space of variable, we can construct the so-called Shannon
wavelets [2]. In a more general approach they can be derived from the real part
of harmonic (complex) wavelets [2] and its scaling function may be obtained by
choosing as such a function in the Fourier space such that it satisﬁes various
conditions for a scaling function and then ﬁnd the wavelet basis. In fact the
Haar and Shannon systems reverse the roles of the kind of scaling and wavelet
functions. Very recently the connection coeﬃcients both of Shannon wavelets
and harmonic wavelets [2] have been explicitly computed at any ordered.
Let us recall that a drawback of the Shannon wavelet in the time domain is
its slow decay which has been improved by smoothing the scaling function in
the frequency space, e.g. by means of the Meyer scaling function that instead
of enjoying a sharp discontinuity, uses a smooth function in order to interpolate
between its 1 and 0 values [4]. In this paper we study the diﬀerentiable structure
of Meyer wavelets and, in particular, its connection coeﬃcients in the line of the
aformentioned results obtained for the Harmonic [2] and Shannon wavelet.

Meyer’s Wavelets

Meyer’s wavelets are deﬁned in a such a way to avoid the slow decay (of compact
support frequency domain wavelets) in the space domain. In order to do this one
needs a continuous interpolating even function ν (ω) deﬁned on R, [0, 1] −valued
which is proportional to ω n+1 (see the interpolating polynomials in table 1).
There follows that the Meyer scaling function is given by [4]

interval (a, b] can be reduced to the basic function (2):

φn0 (ω) are real functions while for k = 0 the functions φnk (ω) have also a nontrivial complex part (see Fig. 1). Moreover, the functions φn0 (ω) are orthonormal
functions with respect to the inner product on L2 (R):

The Meyer wavelet in the Fourier domain is [4]
ψ(ω) = −e−iω/2 φ(ω − 2π) + φ(ω + 2π) φ(ω/2)
and, according to (4),
ψ(ω) = −e−iω/2 e2πiω + e−2πiω φ(ω)φ(ω/2)
i.e.

ψ(ω) = −2e−iω/2 cos(2πω)φ(ω)φ(ω/2)
