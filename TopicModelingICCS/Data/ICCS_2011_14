Abstract
It was reported that the circulating blood cells, including neutrophils, were more likely adherent to the curved micro-vessels than
the straight ones. Our previous work indicated that the vessel curvature, cell-cell interaction, and wall shear stress variation
would greatly affect this preferential adhesion. It was also found that the affinity state of integrins would be influenced by
different divalent cations, which provides an opportunity to explore the particular importance of integrins activation in
neutrophils adhesion. In this study, we aim at numerically investigating the effects of divalent cations, i.e. Mn2+, Mg2+ plus
EGTA, and Ca2+, on VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion under flow condition. The blood dynamics was carried out by the lattice
Boltzmann method (LBM), the neutrophil dynamics was governed by the Newton’s law of translation and rotation, and a refined
neutrophil adhesive dynamics model that taken into account the effect of wall shear stress gradient on receptor-ligand bonds was
applied to solve the VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion. The simulation results indicated that the divalent cations significantly influenced
neutrophils adhesion under hydrodynamic condition. It was found that the capability of stimulating affinity state of VLA-4 to
VCAM-1 was larger in Mg2+ plus EGTA than in Ca2+, and largest in the presence of Mn2+. Our results would be helpful to
understand the ȕ1-integrin-mediated neutrophils adhesion in real physiological situations.

1. Introduction
Neutrophils are the most abundant type of leukocytes in humans and form an essential part of the innate immune
system. During the course of a normal immune response, the neutrophils are recruited to the sites of inflammation.
This process has been intensively studied and referred to as the neutrophils adhesion cascade [1]. The adhesion
molecules in the integrins family function concomitantly or sequentially to mediate neutrophils adhesion to
endothelium. This kind of integrin-mediated adhesion has been proved to play a significant role in embryonic
development, inflammation, thrombosis, and cancer metastasis [2].
Most studies of integrin-mediated adhesion have focused on the ȕ2 integrins family and its principal endothelial
intercellular cell adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1) [3]. In recent years, the role that members in the ȕ1 integrins
family play in neutrophils adhesion has also received great attention [4]. The most important member of the ȕ1

integrins family on neutrophils is the VLA-4 (Į4ȕ1), whose principal counter-receptor is the vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Interactions between VLA-4 and VCAM-1 have been found to play an important role in
lymphocytes and monocytes adhesions [5]. However, the role of VLA-4/VCAM-1 bonds in mediating neutrophils
adhesion has not been completed understood, although there was obvious evidence that VLA-4/VCAM-1 bonds
would regulate neutrophils adhesion to endothelium [6].
An important step for neutrophils adhesion is the activation of integrins to their high affinity for their ligands [7].
In the natural state, this activation of integrins is caused by the intracellular signaling events in response to
inflammatory stimuli [8]. Our previous study indicated that the wall shear stress and its gradient would contribute to
the activation of adhesion molecules [9]. It was also reported that the affinity conformation of many integrins can be
influenced by different divalent cations in extracelluar medium [10]. This feature provides an opportunity to explore
the particular importance of integrins activation in the absence of general activation of the neutrophils [11]. The
responses to divalent cations are different among integrins. It has been observed that the affinity form of VLA-4 to
endothelial ligand VCAM-1 is higher in Mg2+ than in Ca2+, and highest in Mn2+ [12]. In contrast, VLA-4 is thought
to be unique in the ȕ1 integrins family which is active in Ca2+ and initiates neutrophils adhesion under physiological
conditions without further activation [10].
The extensive studies on neutrophils adhesion have led to the development of numerous mathematical models.
Hammer and Apte firstly proposed an adhesive dynamics model for selectin-mediated neutrophils adhesion [13].
Since then, various simplifications, modifications, and refinements of the models were proposed. In the previous
work, we improved a modified adhesive dynamics model that included the effects of wall shear stress and its
gradient on cell adhesion in the curved vessels [9]. Recently, a special adhesive dynamics model has been developed
to study the VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion in the blood vessels [11, 12].
A recent in vivo experimental study revealed that the circulating blood cells, including neutrophils, were more
likely adherent to the curved micro-vessels than the straight ones [14]. Our previous work suggested that the vessel
curvature, cell-cell interaction, and wall shear stress variation would contribute to this phenomenon [9, 15]. While
aforementioned studies have led to a better understanding of cell adhesion, our understanding is still poor for the
role of VLA-4/VCAM-1 bonds in mediating neutrophils adhesion in different divalent cations. The neutrophils and
endothelial ligand VCAM-1 are usually set to be immobilized in experiments, since it is difficult to observe cells
under flow conditions. However, the cells are always circulating in the blood vessels. Therefore, our objective is to
numerically study the effects of different divalent cations on VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion under low Reynolds
number laminar flow.
2. Numerical Methods
The simulations should solve the blood dynamics, neutrophil dynamics, and neutrophil adhesive dynamics. The
blood dynamics was implemented by the LBM, which has been a promising numerical tool to effectively simulate
complex physics in CFD [16]. The neutrophil dynamics was governed by the Newton’s law, and the neutrophil
adhesive dynamics was solved by the refined model of cell adhesion.
2.1. Lattice Boltzmann Method
The blood flow field was solved by the LBM. The lattice Boltzmann equation with the BGK collision operator is,
fi (x+eiįt, t+įt) – fi (x, t) = – [fi (x, t) – fieq (x, t)]/Ĳ

(1)

where fi (x, t) is the distribution function for the particle with velocity ei at position x and time t, įt is the time
increment, Ĳ is the non-dimension relaxation time which is set as 0.75 in our simulations, and fieq(x, t) is the
equilibrium distribution function. In the D2Q9 model, an appropriate form of fieq(x, t) is chosen as,
fieq(x,t) = wi [1+3(eiu)/c2 + 9(eiu)2/2c4–3u2/2c2]

(2)

1041

Weiwei Yan et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1039–1047

where c = įx/įt is defined as the lattice speed, įx is the length of lattice. wi is the weight coefficients given by w0 =
4/9, wi = 1/9 for i = 1,2,3,4, and wi = 1/16 for i = 5,6,7,8. Once fi (x, t) is known, the macroscopic blood density ȡ and
momentum ȡu can be obtained by,
ȡ =  fi (x, t) =  fieq (x, t); ȡu =  ei fi (x, t) =  ei fieq (x, t)

(3)

Boundary condition plays an extremely important role in the lattice Boltzmann simulation, and it will greatly
influence the accuracy and stability of the numerical results. In the present simulations, the half-way bounce back
scheme [17] was adopted to treat the straight vessel walls, and the extrapolation treatment [18] was applied to solve
the curved vessel walls and the moving neutrophil boundaries. The inlet and outlet were implemented by the
pressure boundary scheme [19].
2.2. Neutrophil Dynamics
The neutrophil dynamics follows the Newton’s law of translation and rotation,
duc/dt = Fc/m; dȦc/dt = Tc/I

(4)

where uc is the velocity of the neutrophil, Ȧc is the angular velocity, m is the mass, I is the inertia, dt is the time step,
Tc is the torque, and Fc is the total force. Fc = Fv+Fs+Fh, where Fv is the repulsive van der Waals force which can be
derived by the Derjaguin approximation [20], Fs is the total spring force, and Fh is the fluid force which is
calculated by the momentum exchange method and lubrication theory [21]. Here, if the distance between vessel
surface and neutrophil is superior to one lattice spacing, the momentum exchange method are completely competent
for the calculation of fluid force; otherwise, a lubrication force should be added to the hydrodynamic force to make
up the losing force which is resulted from the loss of lattice nodes. Tc = Th+Ts, where Th and Ts are the torques
induced by the fluid force and spring force, respectively. Since the lubrication force is normal to the neutrophil
surface, there is no torque induced by this force. The position xc and rotational angle șc of the neutrophil at each time
step are determined by dxc/dt = uc and dșc/dt = Ȧc, respectively.
2.3 Neutrophil Adhesive Dynamics
The neutrophil adhesion process is governed by the neutrophil adhesive dybnamics, which was integrated to take
into account the effect of stochastic bonds. In adhesive dynamics model, the neutrophil is idealized as a disc, the
integrins on neutrophil surface are defined as receptors and these on endothelial surface are defined as ligands. Once
the distance between a receptor and a ligand is smaller than the critical length Hc, there is a chance to form receptorligand bond. The interactions between receptors and ligands are realized via the compression or expansion of ideal
adhesive springs. This process is also related to the bond association and dissociation rates. The refined reaction
rates that involved the wall shear stress gradient effect on neutrophils adhesion in the curved micro-vessels are [9],
kf = kf 0.exp[-ıts(Ȥ-Ȝ)2/(2kb T)].exp(k1. dĲ/dl); kr = kr 0.exp[Ȗı(Ȥ-Ȝ)/(kb T)].exp(-k2. dĲ/dl)

(5)

where kf 0 and kr0 are the unstressed association and dissociation rates, ı and ıts are the spring constant and transition
state spring constant, kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, Ȗ is the reactive compliance, Ȥ is the
distance between a receptor and a ligand, and Ȝ is the equilibrium bond length. dĲ/dl is the wall shear stress gradient,
where k1 and k2 are two parameters that represent the sensitivity of wall shear stress gradient to bond association and
dissociation rates. In our simulations, k1 = 2.0 μm/Pa and k1 = 65.0 μm/Pa. This refined adhesive dynamics model
can be reduced to the general adhesion model at dĲ/dl = 0 in the straight vessels. Once kf and kr are known, the
appropriate expressions for the probability of bond formation and breakage tethers in a time step dt can also be
obtained by,

Pf =1–exp(–kf .dt); Pr =1–exp(–kr.dt)

(6)

where Pf and Pr are the probabilities of forming and breaking a bond in a time interval dt, respectively. A stochastic
Monte Carlo technique is used to determine the formation and breakage of each free and binding adhesion molecule
during each time step. The total spring force can be calculated by the summation of all the adhesive springs based on
the Hooke’s law: Fs = ı(Ȥi – Ȝ ), i = 1 to n, where n is the total number of bonds in each time step.
In neutrophils adhesion, the chemical reaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 involves a single step reversible
reaction of receptors binding to their ligands [22]. However, there exist two steps leading to the formation of bonds
for VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion [11, 12]. The first step involves the formation of a reaction zone, and the second step
is the binding reaction itself. This novel model involves three zones: potential reaction zones (PRZ), reaction zones
(RZ), and bonded zones (ZB). RZ is defined as a region where the neutrophils membrane is in proximity to the
endothelial substrate and contain an unbound VLA-4 in its high affinity state, ZB is formed when the VLA-4 binds
to VCAM-1 on the endothelial substrate, and PRZ is thought to be not form bonds but can become RZ by
combination of three mechanisms. Fig. 1a shows a region containing a high affinity that is not in close contact can
move into close contact, Fig. 1b shows an integrin in close contact which is in a low affinity state can undergo a
conformational change to a high affinity state, and Fig. 1c illustrates an integrin in a high affinity state can diffuse
into a region of close contact that does not initially contain one. This novel model does not distinguish between three
mechanisms but treats the transition from PRZ to RZ as a single kinetic step. The kinetics of binding involves five
coefficients: k+ and k  govern the formation of RZ from PRZ, kf and kr represent the kinetics of forming or
breaking a bond with RZ, and k–BI characterizes the transition of a bond to the inactive zone. The adhesive dynamics
model and the chemical reaction equation of VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion are all illustrated in Fig. 1.
3. Results and Discussion
In this paper, the effects of divalent cations on VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion in both the straight and curved vessels
were carried out by the LBM. The length of the straight vessel is L= 420 μm and the height is H = 40 μm. Fig. 2 is
the schematic view of the curved vessel. The dimensions of the vessels were designed to be similar to those of the
real vessels in humans. A, B, C and D were the conjunctions of positive and negative curvatures. We also used a cell
of radius Rc = 5.0 Pm , a typical size of a travelling neutrophil in the blood vessels. The cell was driven by a pressure
difference p = 8.75 Pa for the straight vessel and ' p 10.0 Pa for the curved vessel, with which the pressure drop
of both cases was about 0.02 Pa/μm. The values of simulation parameters and the validation of our present
numerical scheme can be found in our previous studies [9, 15].

3.1 Effects of Divalent Cations on VLA-4/VCAM-1 Adhesion in the Straight Micro-vessel
The divalent cations of Mg2+ plus EGTA, Mn2+, and Ca2+ were often used to study neutrophils adhesion due to
their significant abilities in changing integrins affinity for their ligands. The densities of VLA-4 and VCAM-1 are
chosen as ȡVLA-4 = 5.0/μm2 and ȡVCAM-1 = 200/μm2 [15], respectively. The kinetic coefficients for VLA-4/VCAM-1
adhesion in different divalent cations have been experimentally studied [12], and their values are tabulated in Table
1. Since k  in Ca2+ was too large to be experimentally measured, so we used a comparative large k  = 1000 s-1.
The history of VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion in Mg2+ plus EGTA, Mn2+ and Ca2+ in the straight micro-vessel is
shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3(a), it can be found that the neutrophil is translating and rotating along the vessel wall in
Mn2+, and the trajectories of cell (not shown) in other two divalent cations are similar to that in Mn2+ but with
different density of cell in the same displacement (from 40 to 380 μm). Figs. 3(b)-(c) show the velocity and angular
velocity of the neutrophil, respectively. It can be found that the cell speed in Mn2+ almost oscillates between 350 and
700 μm/s, the variation in Ca2+ is much larger than that in Mn2+ which ranges from 350 to 1000 μm/s, and the largest
change of velocity occurs in Mg2+ plus EGTA which fluctuates between 200 and 1000 μm/s. There are also
fluctuations in angular velocity with the range from -120 to 70 rad/s in Mn2+ and from -130 to -70 rad/s in Ca2+. Like
that in Ca2+, the angular velocity in Mg2+ plus EGTA almost oscillates between -130 and -70 rad/s, and the minority
even reaches to -50 rad/s due to the strong cell adhesion that result from the small k–BI in this situation. The
difference profiles in cell speed and angular speed are caused by the different abilities of divalent cations in
changing affinity form of ȕ1-integrin for its ligand VCAM-1. The number of bonds in these divalent cations is
shown in Fig. 3(d). It can be clearly found that most of the bonds number in Mn2+ fluctuates between 0 to 4, and few
reaches up to 5. The bonds number in Ca2+ is comparatively thinner, and the maximum value of bonds number is
only 3, owing to the larger k  and lower k  in Mn2+ than that in Ca2+. In fact, k  and k  should be the most
important coefficients that determine the formation of active reaction zones, which are the prerequisite for bond
formation to occur. Compare to that in Ca+, the number of bonds in Mg2+ is much thinner which means the less
ability in creating new bonds in this situation. Since the k–BI in Mg2+ is considerably less than that in Ca+, the
maximum bonds number in Mg2+ can reach up to 4. From the above discussions, it can be concluded that the Mn2+
has the highest ability in changing affinity state of VLA-4 for its endothelial ligand VCAM-1 under flow condition,
and the higher integrin activation capability occurs in Mg2+, which is a little stronger than that in Ca+2.

3.2 Effects of Divalent Cations on VLA-4/VCAM-1 Adhesion in the Curved Micro-vessel
In real physiological conditions, neutrophils adhesion always occurs in the curved blood vessels. The neutrophils
adhesion, which is taken into account the integrated effects of vessel curvature, wall shear stress gradient, and
divalent cations, will much more comprehensive to reflect the stochastic and complicated biophysical process of
neutrophils adhesion in real situations. In the next, the influences of these three factors on VLA-4/VCAM-1
adhesion are examined in the curved micro-vessel by the LBM.

Fig. 4 shows the history of VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion under these triple effects in the curved vessel. Fig. 4(a)
illustrates the trajectory of the neutrophil with both translation and rotation in Mn2+, from which one can found that
the strongest cell adhesion occurs when the cell entering the conjunction B, since the shear stress gradient effect is
dominant at these sites. The comparative more obvious cell adhesion takes place between the conjunctions A and B
due to the great effect of vessel curvature there. The profiles of cell trajectories (not shown) in the presence of other
two divalent cations are roughly similar to that in Mn2+. There are strong oscillations in both cell velocity and
angular velocity, which are shown in Figs. 4(b)-(c). In Mn2+, both of them vary greatly at the conjunctions B and C
due to the significant changes of bonds reaction rates there. In Ca2+, the strong vibrations occur from t = 0 to 0.08s
and then following comparatively smooth velocity and angular velocity, indicating that the cell is left from the
vessel wall and become a free cell. The velocity and angular velocity in Mg2+ is much more complex. They strongly
fluctuate between 0 and 1000 μm/s and between 0 and -100 rad/s from t = 0 to 0.65s, and then they become much
smoother, since there is no cell adhesion at all. Fig. 4(d) shows the history of bonds number of the neutrophil in
these three divalent cations. It can be easily found that the most obvious cell adhesion occurs in the presence of
Mn2+, and the comparative evident cell adhesion happens in Mg2+ plus EGTA, which is much superior to that in
Ca2+. In Mn2+, the number of bonds between the conjunctions A and B is almost oscillating between 1 and 4, and
few reaches to 5 due to the strong vessel curvature effect there. Between B and C, lots of bond number arrives at 5,
suggesting that there will be very large probability of cell arrest caused by the great jump of wall shear stress
gradient there. Once the cell gets to C, the number of bonds decreases and vibrates between 0 and 4, owing to the
significant drop of wall shear stress gradient there. The cell finally becomes free and there is no cell adhesion. The
number of bonds in Mg2+ plus EGTA varies between 0 and 5, and it keeps zero from x | 190 μm, since the effect of
vessel curvature is superior to wall shear stress gradient there. The cell adhesion in Ca2+ is rather weak, it only
maintains from 40 to 90 μm, and then all the old bonds are broken and no new bond is created. In fact, the
neutrophil adhesion is a rather complex process in the curved vessels, the divalent cations, vessel curvature, and wall
shear stress gradient all would affect the formation/breakage of bonds, which simultaneously determine the
neutrophil to roll along the vessel walls or slip from the endothelial surfaces.

The comparisons of the average adhesion probability of VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion in different divalent cations
in both the straight and curved vessels are tabulated in Table 2. The adhesion probability is defined as the number of
contacts for which adhesion occurred divided by the total number of contacts. From these data, one can found that
the effects of divalent cations on neutrophil adhesion are significant. It can be found that the adhesion probabilities
are 44.14% and 42.6% in Mn2+, 20.26% and 26.7% in Mg2+ plus EGTA, and 19.13% and 2.8% in Ca2+ in the
straight and curved vessels, respectively. The influence of wall shear stress gradient on cell adhesion is also great.
The shear stress gradient causes the netrophil to leave the vessel wall which resulted in the decrease of adhesion
probabilities in the curved vessel.
4. Conclusion
The ȕ1-integrin-mediated neutrophils adhesion under hydrodynamic flow conditions has been numerically studied
by the LBM. Specially, the VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion in different divalent cations in both the straight and curved
micro-vessels has been examined. A novel dynamics model was applied to simulate VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion. The
effect of wall shear stress gradient on VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion was also taken into account in the curved microvessel. The simulation results lead to the following conclusions:
(1) Divalent cations, i.e. Mn2+, Mg2+ plus EGTA and Ca2+, significantly influence the neutrophils adhesion under
blood flow condition. Among them, Mn2+ has the largest capability in stimulating the affinity state of VLA-4 to

endothelial ligand VCAM-1, and the larger ability of that occurs in Mg2+ plus EGTA, which is superior to that in
Ca2+. This result agrees well with the experimental outcomes that performed on immobilized integrins of
neutrophils and their liangds without blood flow.
(2) The effect of wall shear stress gradient on neutrophil adhesion is also great in the curved vessels. The wall shear
stress gradient causes some sites of curved vessels are more easier to catch the neutrophils and some places are
harder to arrest the cells. Actually, neutrophils adhesion is a rather complex process in the curved vessel, and the
divalent cations, vessel curvature, and wall shear stress gradient all would contribute to this cell adhesion. The
present results would be helpful to understand neutrophils adhesion in real physiological situations.
