Abstract. This paper deals with the description of a theoretical background of systematic computer algebra methods for the formation of
structural matrices of piezoceramic ﬁnite elements. The eﬃciency of computer algebra application was compared here with the numerical integration methods of forming the structural matrices of the ﬁnite elements. To
this end, the computer algebra system VIBRAN was used. Two popular
ﬁnite elements for modelling piezoceramic actuators of the sector-type
and the triangular one are discussed. All structural matrices of the elements were derived, using the computer algebra technique with the
following automatic program code generation.

Introduction

Recent advances in the development, theory and applications of new smart
materials, structures and devices, including the materials with extremely high
piezoelectric or magnetostrictive properties (e.g., Terfenol-D or PMN – lead magnesium niobate) have extended the area of mechatronics, providing systems with
very high levels of integration and multifunctionality [3]. Some concepts, e.g.,
actuators with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, transmission of energy
to actuators through some distance, active bearings, etc., could be treated as
solutions that deﬁne a problem. In some cases, the introduction of piezomechanical systems creates a new synergistic eﬀect and, as in all integrated systems,
the problem of maximum interaction between subsystems is the key to optimal
design. Although the introduction of new piezoactive materials, that have found
application in the areas of actuators, transducer technology, energy transformers, control devices, etc., has been very intensive in recent years [1, 7, 12, 16],
the main concepts, ideas and eﬀects are relatively unknown to design engineers.
The holistic complex interaction of dynamic eﬀects, energy transformation and
devices based on them are described, while the physics involved in the piezoelectric theory may be regarded as the coupling between Maxwell’s equations of
electromagnetism and the elastic stress equations of motion [9, 11, 13, 14].
The ﬁnite element method (FEM) is widely used for modelling complicated
structures [17]. In the FEM the continuum is digitized and thus the numerical

approximation is chosen. By means of numerical integration the result of suﬃcient accuracy could often be obtained, and using more eﬀective computer facilities, this technique is mostly chosen. However, the order of numerical integration
implies thorough adjustment to the order of polynomial expressions to be integrated, and this fact is not generally known. The use of a more precise formula for
numerical integration will not produce more accurate results, but will somewhat
‘stiﬀen’ the examined structure [5, 6]. On the other hand, even the use of the exact
numerical integration scheme always yields some numerical error that can become
important in particular ﬁnite element applications, requiring a high accuracy of
analysis [10, 15].
Moreover, it is known that the formation of the structural matrices is one
of the most computationally expensive procedures in FEM [1], and the use of
numerical integration for these purposes is not the optimal solution. This fact
becomes particularly keen in case of ﬁnite element applications in the structures
of piezoactive materials. Besides the conventional stiﬀness matrix there appear
three additional ones: matrices of mass, electro-elasticity, and capacity [1, 4].
The numerical integration procedure is especially expensive for the formation
of the latter matrices, because the power of integral expressions is higher. The
computer algebra oﬀers wide opportunities in the formation of ﬁnite element
structural matrices. Regretfully we see that much routine algebraic work in the
FEM, is usually done by hand or by means of numerical approximations, while
it could be done by the computer algebra technique much faster, reliably and
better. Another most important aspect is that the results, obtained in this way,
often make considerable economies of computer resources and assure a proper
accuracy of evaluations [5]. Despite that, even the classical books on FEM [17]
do not mention any possibility of symbolic manipulations in the formation of
element structural matrices.
There is one advantage of the numerical integration mentioned: for a particular type of ﬁnite elements, the structural matrices are always to be expressed in
the same way through interpolating functions and their derivatives, and therefore the universal computational subroutines can be applied to various ﬁnite elements [8, 17]. However, the same extent of generality is a characteristic feature
of computer algebra methods, too. Moreover, the user of programs, generated by
computer algebra, does not have to consider the powers of polynomial expressions to be integrated, which is necessary in order to select the proper numerical
integration scheme [2]. Even the users of modern commercial codes (such as ALGOR, ANSYS, etc.) have determined the necessary number of integration points
for some types of ﬁnite elements at the stage of initial data reading [5].

Application of the Finite Element Method to
Piezoceramic Structures

The mechanical and electrical phenomena as well as their coupling complicate
the application of FEM to piezoceramic structures, such as actuators or other
devices mentioned above. Thus the state of each ﬁnite element nodal point can

Computer Algebra for the Formation of Structural Matrices

be represented by the values of the nodal displacement {δ} and potential {ϕ}
[1]. When describing a ﬁnite element, the displacements and potentials at any
point are expressed via nodal values as follows:
{U } = [N ] {δ} ,
{Φ} = [L] {ϕ} ,

(1)

where [N ] and [L] are, in the general case, interpolating functions, and{δ}, {ϕ}
are nodal displacements and potentials, respectively.
The strain vector could be expressed in the form [17]
{ε} = [B] {δ} .

(2)

Similarly, the electric ﬁeld could be expressed in the form [1]
{E} = [BE ] {ϕ} .

(3)

Thus, the equations of piezoelectric eﬀect on the elementary volume are expressed as [16]
T

{σ} = cE {ε} − [e] {E} ,
{D} = [e] {ε} + S {E} ,

(4)

where [cE ], [e], [ s ] are the matrix of stiﬀness for a constant electric ﬁeld, the
matrix of the piezoelectric constant, and the matrix of the dielectric constant
evaluated under constant strain, respectively; {σ}, {ε}, {D}, {E} are the vectors
of stress, strain, electric induction, and the electric ﬁeld, respectively.
The analysis of piezoelectric actuators must be made taking into consideration the electric occurrence in the system. Based on the FEM, each node of
the element has an additional degree of freedom used for electric potentials in
FEM modelling. The solution applied to the equations of motion, ﬁt for the
actuator, can be derived from the principle of the minimal potential energy by
means of the variation functional [4]. The basic dynamic FEM equation of motion for piezoelectric transducers that are entirely covered with electrodes can
be expressed as follows [1]:
[M ] δ¨ + [C] δ˙ + [K] {δ} − [T ] {ϕ} = {R (t)} ,
T

[T ] {δ} + [S] {ϕ} = {Q} ,

(5)

where [M], [K], [T], [S], [C] are the matrices of mass, stiﬀness, electro elasticity,
capacity, and damping, respectively;{δ}, {ϕ}, {R}, {Q} are the vectors of node
displacements, potentials, external mechanical forces, and charges coupled on
the electrodes, respectively.
Here the structural matrices of the piezoceramic ﬁnite element of volume V

The damping matrix [C] is derived using the mass and stiﬀness matrices by
denoting the constants α andβ. γ is the mass density.
The procedure to obtain the structural matrices of ﬁnite elements consists of
the following steps:
1. Deﬁnition of interpolating functions, which are inverse to the conﬁguration
matrix obtained from interpolating polynomials.
2. Obtaining the derivatives of interpolating functions.
3. Multiplication of all the necessary submatrices.
4. Integration of these products over the volume of a ﬁnite element.

Implementation of Computer Algebra

Usually piezoceramic actuators are of a simple form, e.g., plates, rings, cylinders,
etc. [3, 7]. Therefore the simple form ﬁnite elements are used. Two popular ﬁnite
elements will be presented for modelling piezoceramic actuators of a sector-type
and the triangular one. The interpolating functions for the sector-type ﬁnite
element with four nodal points in polar coordinates (ρ, θ) could be expressed as
follows [1]:
⎫
⎧
(R2 − ρ) (θ2 − θ) ⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎬
⎨

(ρ − R1 ) (θ2 − θ)
,
(11)
{N } =
(ρ − R1 ) (θ − θ1 ) ⎪
(R2 − R1 ) (θ2 − θ1 ) ⎪
⎪
⎪
⎭
⎩
(R2 − ρ) (θ − θ1 )
where R1 , R2 , θ1 , θ2 are the values of sector radius and the angle boundary.
And the matrix [Bi ] for the i-th node of the element is [1]

becomes

where h is thickness of the element.
Analogously, formulas (7)–(10) of the other matrices have the same structure.
The structural matrices of the sector-type ﬁnite element were derived using
the computer algebra system VIBRAN, that is a FORTRAN preprocessor for
analytical perturbation with polynomials, rational functions, and trigonometric
series [3]. A special VIBRAN procedure can generate an optimized FORTRAN
code from the obtained analytical expressions [2], which can be directly used in
the programs for numerical analysis. The computer algebra technique is more
convenient than numerical for this purpose, because the polynomials under integrals are of the negative power of order −1 for the sector-type ﬁnite element
in the polar coordinates. Consequently, numerical integration is not very useful. Table 1 illustrates the number of products necessary to form the structural
matrices of the piezoceramic sector ﬁnite element. For the sake of clarity, we
consider only three matrices of the mass, stiﬀness, and electro-elasticity, because
their formation is more expensive.

Another geometrically suitable ﬁnite element is triangle, which allows modelling various surfaces [17]. The ﬁrst member of a triangular membrane or a
bending element family is the element with three nodes and the interpolating
polynomial of second order. The triangular ﬁnite element is also suitable to determine the conﬁguration of optimal electrodes of the piezoceramic actuators [4].
The interpolating functions for the triangular ﬁnite element are expressed in the
area of L-coordinates [5, 17]

i = 1, 2, 3,
where bi , ci are nodal coordinate diﬀerences with cyclic permutation of indices
1→ 2 → 3 → 1 for the remaining coeﬃcients [5]. The matrix [Bi ] of the triangular
element for the i-th node is [17]

Analogously, the formulas (7)–(10) of the other matrices are of the same
structure. Integration of the products (17) in algebraic form over the area of a
ﬁnite element in L-coordinates according to [17] could be expressed as follows:

Conclusions

The proposed analytical formation of the structural matrices of piezoceramic
ﬁnite elements reduces the number of ﬂoating point operations more than twice,
particularly for the mass matrix of the elements. The highest economy is gained
during the integration procedure, because, after the integration, the expressions
of matrix elements become shorter due to disappearance of variables. The distributed mass, electro-elasticity, and damping matrices always yield relatively
simple ﬁnal analytical expressions even for complex ﬁnite elements. Due to the
fact that the integral expressions to be integrated, in these cases, have the power
at least twice higher than that of the ordinary stiﬀness matrix, the use of computer algebra remarkably saves the required computer time as compared to the
numerical integration technique. It should be also emphasized that the computer
time economy is followed by an increased accuracy of computations, which is, in
many cases, the most important gain achieved.
