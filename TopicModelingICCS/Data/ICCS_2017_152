Lorinc Garai et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1500–1511

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a common method for the analysis of vitamin
A and E in margarine samples. ISO standards EN 12823-1:2014, EN 12822 (further standards) define
the methods of direct extraction and of saponification in the preparation of fatty samples for HPLC.
According to standards, the method of direct extraction requires no heating, assuring the full
recovery of the heat sensitive vitamin A and E (Thompson et al., 1980, Nollet, 1996). This method is
compatible with normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) since fatty
samples can be dissolved in apolar solvents and are directly injected to the chromatograph. Drawbacks
of direct extraction are:
•
•

Limit of Detection (LOD) is high: due to the high lipid content the sample can hardly be
concentrated.
Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) commonly used in laboratories
poses difficulties: a switch, if needed, to NP-HPLC requires thorough washing of the
tubing even if it is time and solvent consuming. Instead, a switch to another RP-HPLC
eluent would be more simple. Further, RP-HPLC compatible solvents (e.g. methanol,
acetonitrile) are not applicable for fatty samples’ direct extraction.

The method of saponification is another way of fatty sample preparation for HPLC analysis of
vitamin A and E (Nollet, 1996). In contrast to the method of direct extraction, samples for
saponification can be concentrated. In foods containing vitamin A and E in native and esterified forms
(e.g. acetate, palmitate), the method of saponification allows them to be measured jointly and no
special reference material is required for measuring ester forms. Drawback of the method of
saponification is the light and heat sensitivity of the analytes, conditions worth to consider (Gimeno et
al., 2000; Xu, 2008).
Compared to NP-HPLC systems, RP-HPLC systems are more common in use, consequently, the
method of saponification is preferred. Regarding standards, two important factors, temperature and
time of saponification are only given in ranges instead of exact settings. In my previous study (Garai,
2016), optimum finding for temperature and time of saponification was performed in separate test runs
for vitamin A and E (in margarine and vegetable oil samples, respectively). However, in a sample
containing both vitamins, vitamin A and E can be tested simultaneously within the same test run, if the
optimal saponification settings for both analytes are similar. The goal of my work is to find optimum
settings in time and temperature in the method of saponification of vitamin A and E for their
simultaneous test. Further, key steps of SED are presented.
For this purpose, two-factor, two-level statistical experimental design (SED) was introduced to
optimize time and temperature settings in the method of saponification.
Sample extracts were examined by RP-HPLC. Fatty samples were taken from margarine brand
‘Delma Joghurt’ for measuring all-trans retinol of Vitamin A and α-tocopherol of vitamin E.

Initial experiments were made with first degree SED (Montgomery, 2009). Adequacy of the design
was checked with center point settings. Depending on the results, the SEDs were completed to second
degree if needed. SEDs were generated and evaluated with Statsoft Statistica 13.

2.3 Sample preparation
For the experiments, replicates were prepared as shown below in brief:
• 3-5 g of margarine was weighed into a 250 ml flask.
• 300 mg of ascorbic acid was added.
• 50 ml of EtOH, then 15 ml of 50 % KOH was added.
• Saponification was performed under reflux cooler. Successful saponification was indicated by
the disappearance of fatty drops.
• Sample was rinsed from flask with 50 ml EtOH into a 250 ml funnel.
• 120 ml water was added (breaking emulsion), then extraction was made with 3×50 ml
hexane.
• Hexane phase was washed with water three times.
• Hexane phase was rotary evaporated at 50 °C and 260 mbar.
• Residue was dissolved in 10 ml of MeOH.

3.2 Outline of result evaluation
Evaluation with Statsoft Statistica 13 happened as shown below.
• Initial criterion for further evaluation was the normal distribution of residuals1
• Adequacy of the SED was tested by comparing predicted and measured center point values
• Main effects2 were defined.
• If SED had been adequate, surface diagram was plotted to visualize factor effects.
Residual: the term stands for the difference between measured and predicted values of dependent
variable.
2
Main effect: the term stands for the effect of one independent variable on dependent variable,
ignoring the effects of all other independent variables.

3.3 Normal distribution of residuals

3.4 Effect estimates
Examples of effect estimates for vitamin A (Table 5) shows that SED curvature is not significant
(p=0.183 > 0.05), consequently, first degree statistical experimental model is adequate for vitamin A.

Since both vitamin A and E could be tested simultaneously within the same test run, second degree
SED was used for the evaluation of vitamin E content too. For information, Pareto chart for vitamin E
effects is shown in Figure 3. The significance of SED curvature is much more lower than that of the
main effect (see columns of ‘Curvatr.’, and ‘T [°C]). Thus, first degree and also second degree SEDs
are adequate for vitamin E.

Table 6 - continued: Vitamin A and E results (second degree design)

Conclusion of Table 6: results of second degree SED confirm results of first degree SED. That is,
the highest recovery of vitamin A and E is achieved at temperature 82 °C and time 25 min. However,
the second degree SED adequacy for vitamin E is ambiguous (‘Lack of Fit’ factor, p<0.05) as shown
in Table 8. Meanwhile, Table 7 confirms second degree SED adequacy for vitamin A, by the nonsignificant Lack of Fit factor (p>0.05).

Regarding Table 8, vitamin E recovery should follow first degree SED.

3.6 Surface diagrams
Factor effects for vitamin A are visualized on Figure 4. The surface diagram shows an optimum
segment at the shortest time and highest temperature of saponification in the recovery of vitamin A
content. Saponification time (t) and temperature (T) settings for this segment are t=25 and T=82°C. As
T is at its applicable maximum and only t can be changed, further experiments were performed to
shorten time of saponification.

For information, factor effects for vitamin E are visualized in Figure 5.
The Figure 5 surface diagram shows two optimum segments. One is at the shortest time and
highest temperature of saponification for vitamin E. The other is at the longest time and highest
temperature of saponification. Since vitamin A and E are measured simultaneously, settings for
vitamin A were used.

3.7 Further experiments at 82 °C
To shorten, if possible, saponification time, further experiments were made at 82 °C with three
time settings: 25 min, 18 min and 15 min.

4 Conclusion
Methods of saponification described in EN 12822:2014 and EN 12823-1:2014, were optimized
for time and temperature settings. For optimization SED was introduced with the help of Statsoft
Statistica 13 software. Margarine samples supplemented with vitamin A and E were used for testing
SED introduced.
Initial experiments were performed using 2k first degree SED. Adequacy of this design was
checked with center point settings. When adequacy was not found, further experiments were
completed for 3k second degree SED.
Second degree SED was adequate for vitamin A, giving an optimum in recovery at the highest
temperature and shortest time of saponification. Second degree SED did not fit to results obtained with
vitamin E. However, since vitamins A and E were measured simultaneously, SED for vitamin A could
help to find optimum in recovery for vitamin E too. For vitamin A, optimum settings in saponification
temperature and time are 82 °C and 25 minutes while for vitamin E they are 82 °C and 25 minutes,
respectively.
