Abstract. We made a physical model for investigation of laser-induced
breakdown of glass. To estimate the laser energy absorption through
electron heating, we derive a power transfer rate equation and an electron
number density equation for a steady state as a function of temperature
and electric ﬁeld. Numerical simulations using the derived equations show
that the laser power absorption dependence of glass on temperature and
electric ﬁeld strength.

Introduction

Laser ablation has emerged as one of promising techniques for material processing such as thin ﬁlm depositions, nanoparticle fabrications, etc. Laser ablation
has proven its advantages in material processing because it does not contaminates materials during the process. The foundations of laser ablation, however,
lie in the old ﬁeld of laser-material interactions where many materials were irradiated with high power laser pulses. Therefore, studies about the laser-material
interactions have been required to investigate the laser-material interactions.
In this paper, we form a physical model to analyze the laser-induced breakdown of glass, provide simple equations for numerical analysis using experimental
results published from other groups, and show simulation results about energy
absorption, electron number density in terms of temperature and electric ﬁeld
using the derived equations.

Theoretical Background

The interaction between the laser ﬁeld and free electrons can explain the high
power laser breakdown mechanism. Electron avalanche theory [1, 2, 3] has been
accepted to explain the high power laser breakdown of transparent(wide band
gap) solids at both visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This theory assumes
that breakdown starts above the critical laser intensity where the energy gain

rate from the laser ﬁeld by a few electrons exceeds the energy loss rate due to
lattice phonon scattering. These starting electrons with density n0 increase their
kinetic energies in the high electric ﬁeld, and initiate impact ionization leading
to an exponential increase of the free electron density.
S.C. Jones et al. [3] found discrepancies in this theory for explaining laser
induced breakdown of wide band gap materials such as ultrapure alkali halides
and SiO2 at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. In one experiment, they
measured a lattice temperature that increased gradually as the laser intensity
increased and found that breakdown occurred around the melting temperature.
They observed that the lattice temperature gradually increased with increasing
laser intensity. They explained this phenomenon as a multiphoton absorption
process rather than impact ionization process.
Lattice heating was caused by simultaneous free-electron mediated energy
transfer from the laser ﬁeld to the lattice, free-electron heating [4, 5]. B. Gorshkov,
et al. [5], investigated carrier generation processes, both impact ionization and
multiphoton absorption, for laser-induced breakdown and concluded that the
breakdown mechanism begins to change from an impact ionization process to a
multiphoton generation process at near infrared wavelengths such that, at visible
wavelengths, the multiphoton absorption mechanism is dominant in wide band
gap materials.
Pulse width is also an important parameter because electron density increases
exponentially with time for impact ionization while linearly for multiphoton absorption. At wavelengths longer than 2 μm, the electron multiplication rate and
energy transfer rate approach the dc limit, since as the laser frequency decreases,
the momentum relaxation rate becomes larger than the laser frequency. In this
region, the photon ﬁeld of the laser is assumed to be a sinusoidal electric ﬁeld in
which the electrons move. This implies that photon energy is small compared to
the electron kinetic energy such that energy change from the ﬁeld can be continuous in time. At short wavelengths(< 500 nm), impact ionization and freeelectron heating are less dominant because the impact ionization threshold moves
to higher electric ﬁelds, making multiphoton absorption the dominant mechanism. At these wavelengths, even though the multiphoton absorption mechanism
is dominant, free electron heating is another eﬃcient mechanism to contribute
to lattice heating and melting at laser intensities below the impact ionization
threshold.

Physical Model for Numerical Analysis

In the case of glass, D. Arnold et al. [6], showed that neither the quantummechanical approach nor the standard classical approach followed their exact
derivation of the power transfer rate from the laser ﬁeld to electrons at a wavelength of 1 μm. The power transfer rate at this wavelength lay between these
two approaches.
In our numerical simulation of irradiation with a 1 μm laser, the exact power
transfer rate of D. Arnold and E. Cartier [6] was used. This approach eliminated

The evolution of the free-electron density, ne (t), is essential to modeling a
microsphere ablated by a high power laser pulse. Generation and recombination
processes are included in the ionization rate equation as shown below,
∂n
= Pgen − Ploss + Ptherm
∂t

where Pgen is laser induced ionization generation rate, Ploss is loss rate due
to electron hole recombination, and Ptherm is thermal ionization rate. These
equations can be described by
Pgen = γ(E) × ne

where γ(E) is the electric ﬁeld dependent ionization coeﬃcient, E is electric ﬁeld,
σ(E) is the Coulombic capture cross section with ﬁeld dependence. The quantity

ve is the eﬀective velocity. In the dc case at low electric ﬁelds, ve approaches the
drift velocity. In the simulation, the hole density, nh , is assumed to be the same
as the electron density, ne . Nc (T ) is density of states and Eg is the band gap
energy of the material.
D. Buchanan, et al. [7] compared experimental capture cross sections with
numerical simulations using a classical Monte Carlo calculation and a quantum Monte Carlo calculation. The capture cross section decreases from 10−12
to 3 × 10−15 cm2 as the electric ﬁelds goes from 2 × 105 to 3 × 106 V /cm.
Above the threshold electric ﬁeld(≈ 1.2 × 106 V/cm), the ﬁeld dependence of
the capture cross section is a power law with an exponent of −1.5, and below this
threshold, it has an exponent of −3.0. The ionization rate, γ(E), is expressed
as,

γ = α(E)Vdrif t
where Vdrif t is the drift velocity of electrons. The ionization coeﬃcient, α(E), is
given by D. Du [8] as

The constants EkT , Ep , and Ei are threshold electric ﬁelds for electrons to
overcome the decelerating eﬀects of thermal, phonon, and ionization scattering,
respectively. For the laser ﬂuences used in this simulation, the ionization rate,
equation 2, reaches steady state in much less than 1 ns. Therefore, it is solved
for a steady state carrier density at each time step of the simulation. Solving

where n(T ) is the thermal generation given by eq. 5.
The electron number density, given by eq. 8 is shown in Figs. 2, and 3. In our
simulation, the average charge number, Z, was obtained by dividing the electron
number density by the atom number density which was calculated by dividing
the mass density by the average atomic mass.
Figure 3 shows that thermal generation of electrons is dominant in the low
electric ﬁeld region, while in the low temperature region electrons are excited
by the laser electric ﬁeld. In the shockwave experiment reported in this dissertation, the highest electric ﬁeld was 8 M V /cm which corresponds to the laser
energy at the highest enhancement factor with an applied ﬂuence of 12 J/cm2 .
Temperature in this simulation was up to a few 10,000 K. For this case, the
maximum electron number density was about 3 - 5 1022 cm−3 .

Conclusion

To investigate the laser power absorption via electron heating, we form a physical
model of laser energy absorption of glass through electron and derive the power

transfer rate equation and the electron number density equation for a steady
state as a function of temperature and electric ﬁeld.
Numerical simulations show that the electron number density is strongly depends on the electric ﬁeld strength and temperature at low temperature(100K)
and low electric ﬁled strength(0.1M V /cm). At high temperature and electric
ﬁeld regions, the dependency of the electron number density on electric ﬁeld and
temperature decreases. Further experimental and theoretical analysis is required
for the breakdown conditions of glass through laser energy absorption.
