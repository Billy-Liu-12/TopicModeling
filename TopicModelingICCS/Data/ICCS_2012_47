Abstract
The stable structures and 3D aromatic characters for four cationic X44+ (X=O, S, Se, and Te) clusters are investigated at the DFT and post
HF level of theory with the extended 6-311+G* basis set used for O, S, Se atoms and correlation consistent, effective-core potential

ECP

basis set ECP46MWB_AVTZ for the heavier Te atom.. Two optimized structures of tetrahedron (Td) and rhombus (D2h) for four X44+ species
have been obtained. The calculated results show that the tetrahedral (Td) structures are stable and correspond to energy minima, whereas the
rhombic (D2h) ones are unstable and have one or more saddle points on the potential energy surfaces. The calculated NICS values show that
four tetrahedral X44+ isomers have higher degree of 3D aromaticities. Whereas four rhombic X44+ isomers can be regarded to possess 3D
antiaromaticities. The molecular orbital analyses reveal that the tetrahedral X44+ cations possess two-fold (ı and ʌ) 3D aromaticity, conforming
to the 2(N+1)2 electron counting rule for 3D aromaticity

1. Introduction
The concept of aromaticity is one of the most significant concepts in chemistry, generally used to describe cyclic, planar, and
conjugated molecules with delocalized ʌ-bonds and unusual stability, such as benzene and its derivatives [1,2]. In recent years
the aromatic concept has been successfully extended from traditional organic compounds to pure all-metal clusters [3-13] due to
the pioneering works done by Boldyrev’s group[3]. In addition to the aromaticities for planar two-dimensional (2D) molecules,
the aromaticities in three dimensional (3D

structures of clusters, including spherical aromaticity of organic clusters, such as

fullerenes[14], and inorganic cage clusters, such as icosahedral Sn122-, Pb122- with Ih symmetries[15-17], have been intensively
studied and many important progresses have been made in recent decades[14-21]. Advances and general principles in spherical
aromatic clusters have been comprehensively reviewed by Zhong fang Chen et al. [20,21].Tetravalent anions X44-(X=N, P, As,
Sb, and Bi) with Tetrahedral structures are one class of the smallest inorganic clusters possessing 3D aromaticities shown by
Hirsch et al.[22].
For the 3D aromaticity, despite there exist a few limitations and controversial cases so far, some criteria have been
formulated and often used now for identifying the 3D aromaticity, e.g. higher energetical stability, higher structural symmetry,
higher negative values of Nucleus-Independent Chemical Shift (NICS)[23], and electron count rule, such as Wade’s 2n+2
rule[24], typically applied to closo boranes and carboranes, and Hirsch’s 2(n + 1)2 rule, for spherical clusters [21,25].

In this work, a new class of the inorganic tetravalent cations X44+(X=O, S, Se, and Te) are studied theoretically with four
methods: two density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP, B3PW91 and two correlated ab initio MP2, CCSD(T). These clusters are
corroborated to be another class of the smallest inorganic ones possessed 3D aromaticity using the criteria for 3D aromaticity
above. This work will confirm further Hirsch’s closed-shell electron gas model and 2(2N+1)2 electron counting rule for 3D
aromaticity.

2. Computational methods
The structural optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations for the inorganic cations X44+(X=O, S, Se, and Te) are
carried out using four methods: B3LYP, B3PW91 and MP2, CCSD(T). B3LYP is a DFT method using Beck’s three parameters
functional (B3)[26] along with the Lee, Yang, and Parr correlation functional (LYP)[27]. B3PW91 uses B3 along with PerdewWang 1991 correlation functional [28]. MP2 is the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory[29,30]. CCSD(T) is the
coupled-cluster theory using singles and doubles level augmented by a perturbative correction for triple excitations[31-33]. The
extended 6-311+G* basis set is used for O, S, Se atoms and ECP46MWB_AVTZ for the heavier Te atom, which is the
correlation consistent, effective-core potential ECP

basis set with 46 core electrons (1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p64d10) for Te,

including quasi-relativistic effect and triple-zeta [34]. The reason of using ECP46MWB_AVTZ basis set for Te atom is that Te
atom is beyond the element range in which heavier atoms are able to use AUG-cc-pVnZ basis set to compute various physical
and chemical quantities in Gaussian 03 program [35]. ECP46MWB_AVTZ basis set constructed by the Stuttgart/Cologne group
is a good one for Te atom. The electron affinity (EA) of Te is 45.24 kcal/mol calculated with CCSD(T)/ECP46MWB_AVTZ,
being in very well agreement with the experimental value of 45.45±0.01kcal/mol[36].
NICS is still an eĜcient and simple method to probe aromaticitiy not only for planar clusters but also for 3D ones [20,21].
NICS is deﬁned as the negative isotropic value of the Magnetic shielding tensor at the geometrical center of cluster. Aromaticity
is characterized by negative NICS value, antiaromaticity by positive NICS value, and nonaromatic compounds by NICS value
close to zero. In this study, the NICS values are calculated with GIAO-HF/6-311+G*, GIAO-B3LYP/6-311+G* methods based
on the corresponding optimized structures with B3LYP/6-311+G* method except for Te4+ species, for which the used basis set 6311+G* in the methods above is replaced by ECP46MWB_AVTZ). GIAO is the gauge-independent atomic orbital method [37].
The NICS value calculated at the center of X44+(X=O, S, Se, and Te) clusters is denoted as NICS (0.0).
All calculations in this work are performed using the Gaussian 03 program. The MO pictures are drawn using the
Gaussiview 3.0 program[38].

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Energetics and structural properties of X44+ clusters
Two optimized structures of tetrahedron (Td) and rhombus (D2h) for four cations X44+ (X=O, S, Se, and Te) ( Figure 1) have
been obtained. Their bond lengths R, bond angles A, total electronic energies Etot (including zero-point energies (ZPE)), relative
energies Ere, number of imaginary frequencies (Nimag), and vibrational frequencies ȣi with four methods: B3LYP, B3PW91,
MP2, and CCSD(T) are listed in Table 1.

The calculated results in Table 1 show that the tetrahedron (Td) structures are stable with no imaginary frequencies to arise
using all four methods, whereas the rhombus(D2h) structures are unstable with one or more imaginary frequencies to arise using
all four methods except for the rhombus Te44+ with MP2/ ECP46MWB_AVTZ, in which there is no imaginary frequency to arise.
The tetrahedral structures are energetically lower than the rhombic ones with all the four methods except for the case of O44+ with
B3LYP/6-311+G*, in which the Etot of tetrahedron is slightly higher than that of rhombus by 2.07 kcal/mol.

The

tetrahedral structures are lower in average Etot with three methods(B3LYP, B3PW91, MP2) than the rhombic ones by 61.21
kcal/mol for S44+, 67.52 kcal/mol for Se44+, 57.75 kcal/mol for Te44+ except for O44+, for which the two isomers are almost equal
in total energy Etot.

3.2 Magnetic characteristics of aromaticity for X44+(X=O, S, Se, and Te) cations
The calculated NICS(0.0) values (ppm cgsu) at the geometric center of the tetrahedron (Td) and rhombus (D2h) for X44+(X=O,
S, Se, and Te) species are listed in Table 2 with method GIAO-HF, GIAO-B3LYP/6-311+G*//B3LYP/6-311+G* for O44+, S44+,
Se44+ and GIAO-HF, GIAO-B3LYP/ECP46MWB_AVTZ//B3LYP/ ECP46MWB_AVTZ for Te44+. For comparison, the NICS
values for the neutral Tetrahedral (Td) structures of X4 (X=N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) species obtained by Hirsch et al.[22] are also
listed in Table 2. Comparison among these NICS(0.0) data in Table 2 indicates that, except for the NICS(0.0) values of O44+ for
the tetrahedron (Td) isomer with HF method, which is negative, abnormally large and could be considered to be unreasonable, all
other NICS(0.0) values of four tetrahedral X44+ isomers with two methods are significant negative and can be comparable with
those of X4 isomers of the tetrahedron (Td) structures used GIAO- B3LYP/6-311+G** for N, P, As and GIAOB3LYP/LANL2DZp for Sb, Bi. Moreover, from Table 1, these four tetrahedron structures of X44+ are energy minima on
potential energy surfaces. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that four X44+ species with tetrahedron structures possess higher
degree of 3D aromaticities.
For the rhombic structures of X44+, except for the NICS(0.0) values of O44+ with HF method, which is negative, abnormally
large and could also be considered to be unreasonable., other NICS(0.0) values of S44+ , Se44+ , Te44+ with HF method are all
positive, The NICS(0.0) values of the rhombic X44+ isomers with B3LYP method are positive for O44+, S44+ and very small,
negative for Se44+, Te44+. Likewise, Considering their one or more saddle points on corresponding potential energy surface from
Table 1, we can draw a conclusion that the rhombic X44+ isomers can be regarded to have stronger 3D antiaromaticities.

3.3 MO analyses of 3D aromaticity for X44+ species
In this section, we will further explore the 3D aromaticty of the tetrahedral X44+ cations through molecular orbital (MO)
analyses. Four Group-VI elements O, S, Se, and Te each has six valence electrons: four p-AO electrons and two filled s-AO
electrons. Each of X44+ species has 20 valence electrons and occupied ten valence MOs. Due to two basis sets used (6-311+G*
for O44+, S44+, Se44+and ECP46MWB_AVTZ for Te44+) in all calculations, S44+(as a representative for O44+, S44+, and Se44+) and
Te44+ species are chosed to draw their respective ten valence MO pictures (Figure 2). From Figure 2, one can see that these two
sets of ten valence MO schemes for S44+ and Te44+ are almost the same, regardless of the used basis sets. These ten valence MOs
are denoted as two HOMO(1e, double degenerate), three HOMO-1(2t2, triply degenerate), one HOMO-2(2a1), three HOMO3(1t2,triply degenerate), one HOMO-4(1a1). Two degenerate HOMOs(1e) and three degenerate HOMO-1s(2t2) are ı-MOs,
consist of cluster d robitals respectively. The splitting into two ı-MO sets from the cluster d orbitals is a consequence of
symmetry lowering from spherical (Kh) to tetrahedral (Td)[22,25]. Another three degenerate HOMO-3s(1t2) are ı-MOs, consist
of cluster p robitals. The HOMO-4(1a1) is ı-MO, consist of cluster s robitals. The HOMO-2(2a1) is

-MO, consist of cluster s

robitals. So there are nine ı-MOs and one -MO, occupied 18 and 2 electrons respectively, each conforming to the 2(N+1)2

352

electron counting rule for 3D aromaticity, with Nı=2 for 18 ı electrons and Nʌ=0 for two ʌ electrons.Therefore, from MO
analyses above one can see that the tetrahedral X44+ cations possess two-fold (ı and ʌ) 3D aromaticity.

4. Conclusion
Two optimized structures of tetrahedron (Td) and rhombus (D2h) for four X44+ species have been obtained through two DFT
(B3LYP, B3PW91) and two post HF (MP2 and CCSD(T)) methods with the extended 6-311+G* basis set used for O, S, Se
atoms and ECP46MWB_AVTZ basis set for the heavier Te atom. The tetrahedron (Td) structures are all energy minima on
potential energy surfaces. Through the NICS calculations and MO analyses, according to several criteria for 3D aromaticity:
higher energetical stability, higher structural symmetry, higher negative NICS values, and Hirsch’s 2(n + 1)2 electron counting
rule, the tetrahedral (Td) X44+(X=O, S, Se, and Te) cations have been shown to possess higher two-fold (ı and ʌ) 3D aromaticity,
while the rhombic X44+ isomers can be regarded to have stronger 3D antiaromaticities.
