Abstract. This paper shows a fuzzy logic speech/non-speech discrimination method for improving the performance of speech processing systems working in noise environments. The fuzzy system is based on a
Sugeno inference engine with membership functions deﬁned as combination of two Gaussian functions. The rule base consists of ten fuzzy
if then statements deﬁned in terms of the denoised subband signal-tonoise ratios (SNRs) and the zero crossing rates (ZCRs). Its operation is
optimized by means of a hybrid training algorithm combining the leastsquares method and the backpropagation gradient descent method for
training membership function parameters. The experiments conducted
on the Spanish SpeechDat-Car database shows that the proposed method
yields clear improvements over a set of standardized VADs for discontinuous transmission (DTX) and distributed speech recognition (DSR) and
also over recently published VAD methods.

Introduction

The deployment of new wireless speech communication services ﬁnds a serious
implementation barrier in the harmful eﬀect of the acoustic noise present in
the operating environment. These systems often beneﬁts from voice activity
detectors (VADs) which are frequently used in such application scenarios for
diﬀerent purposes.
Detecting the presence of speech in a noisy signal is a problem aﬀecting numerous applications including robust speech recognition [1, 2], discontinuous transmission (DTX) in voice communications [3, 4] or real-time speech transmission
on the Internet [5]. The classiﬁcation task is not as trivial as it appears, and
most of the VAD algorithms often fail in high noise conditions. During the last
decade, numerous researchers have developed diﬀerent strategies for detecting
speech in a noisy signal [6, 7, 8, 9] and have evaluated the inﬂuence of the VAD
eﬀectiveness on the performance of speech processing systems [10, 11, 12, 13].
Since its introduction in the late sixties [14], fuzzy logic has enabled deﬁning the behavior of many systems by means of qualitative expressions in a
more natural way than mathematical equations. Thus, an eﬀective approach
for speech/non-speech discrimination in noisy environments is to use these techniques that enables describing the decision rule by means of if-then clauses which

are selected based on the knowledge of the problem. Beritelli [15] showed a robust VAD with a pattern matching process consisting of a set of six fuzzy rules.
However, no speciﬁc optimization was performed at the signal level since the
system operated on feature vectors deﬁned by the popular ITU-T G.729 speech
coding standard [4]. This paper shows an eﬀective VAD based on fuzzy logic rules
for low-delay speech communications. The proposed method combines a noise
robust speech processing feature extraction process together with a trained fuzzy
logic pattern matching module for classiﬁcation. The experiments conducted on
speech databases shows that the proposed method yields improvements over different standardized VADs for DTX and distributed speech recognition (DSR)
and other VAD methods.

Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy logic [16] is much closer in spirit to human thinking and natural language
than traditional logic systems. Basically, it provides an eﬀective means of capturing the approximate, inexact nature of the real world. Viewed in perspective,
the essential part of a fuzzy logic system is a set of linguistic rules related by
the dual concepts of fuzzy implication and the compositional rule of inference.
Fuzzy logic consists of a mapping between an input space and an output space
by means of a list of if-then statements called rules. These rules are useful because
they refer to variables and the adjectives that describe these variables. The mapping is performed in the fuzzy inference stage, a method that interprets the values
in the input vector and, based on some set of rules, assigns values to the output.
Fuzzy logic starts with the concept of a fuzzy set. A fuzzy set F deﬁned on
a discourse universe U is characterized by a membership function μF (x) which
takes values in the interval [0, 1]. A fuzzy set is a generalization of a crisp set. A
membership function provides the degree of similarity of an element in U to the
fuzzy set. A fuzzy set F in U may be represented as a set of ordered pairs of a
generic element x and its grade of membership function: F = {(x, μF (x))|x ∈ U }.
The concept of linguistic variable was ﬁrst proposed by Zadeh who considered
them as variables whose values are not numbers but words or sentences in a
natural or artiﬁcial language. A membership function μF (x) is a curve that
deﬁnes how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value (or
degree of membership) between 0 and 1. The most commonly used shapes for
membership functions are triangular, trapezoidal, piecewise linear and Gaussian.
Membership functions were chosen by the user arbitrarily in the past, based
on the user’s experience. Now, membership functions are commonly designed
using optimization procedures. The number of membership functions improves
the resolution at the cost of greater computational complexity. They normally
overlap expressing the degree of membership of a value to diﬀerent attributes.
Fuzzy sets and fuzzy operators are the subjects and verbs of fuzzy logic. Fuzzy
logic rules based on if-then statements are used to formulate the conditional
statements that comprise fuzzy logic. A single fuzzy if-then rule assumes the
form if x is F then y is G where F and G are linguistic values deﬁned by fuzzy

sets. The if-part of the rule is called the antecedent or premise, while the thenpart of the rule is called the consequent or conclusion. Interpreting an if-then rule
involves distinct parts: i) evaluating the antecedent (which involves fuzzifying
the input and applying any necessary fuzzy operators), and ii) applying that
result to the consequent.

Voice Activity Detection

Figure 1 shows the basic conﬁguration of a fuzzy logic VAD which comprises ﬁve
principal components: i) the feature extraction process that prepares discriminative speech feature for the fuzzy logic classiﬁer, ii) the fuzziﬁcation interface
performs a scale mapping, that transfers the range of values into the corresponding universe of discourse and performs the function of fuzziﬁcation, that converts
input data into suitable linguistic variables viewed as labels of fuzzy sets, iii)
the knowledge base comprises a knowledge of the application domain and the
objective of the VAD. It consists of a database, which provides necessary deﬁnitions which are used to deﬁne linguistic VAD rules and a linguistic (fuzzy) rule
base, which characterizes the VAD goal by means of a set of linguistic rules and
the user experience, iv ) the decision making logic is the kernel of the fuzzy logic
VAD. It has the capability of simulating human decision making based on fuzzy
concepts and of inferring actions employing fuzzy implication and the inference
rules, and v ) the defuzziﬁcation interface performs a scale mapping, which converts the range of output values into the corresponding universe of discourse,
and defuzziﬁcation, which yields a nonfuzzy VAD ﬂag.

and the K -band signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) that are calculated after a previous
denoising process by means of a uniformly distributed ﬁlter bank on the discrete
Fourier spectrum of the denoised signal.

Inference Engine

A Sugeno inference engine was preferred over Mamdani’s method since: i) it is
computationally eﬃcient, ii) it works well with linear techniques, iii) it works
well with optimization and adaptive techniques, iv ) it has guaranteed continuity
of the output surface and v ) it is well-suited to mathematical analysis. Once
the inputs have been fuzziﬁed, we know the degree to which each part of the
antecedent has been satisﬁed for each rule. The input to the fuzzy operator is
two or more membership values from fuzziﬁed input variables. Any number of
well-deﬁned methods can ﬁll in for the AND operation or the OR operation. We
have used the product for AND, the maximum for OR and the weighted average
as the defuzziﬁcation method. Finally, the output of the system is compared to
a ﬁxed threshold η. If the output is greater than η, the current frame is classiﬁed
as speech (VAD ﬂag= 1) otherwise it is classiﬁed as non-speech or silence (VAD
ﬂag= 0). We will show later that modifying η enables the selection of the VAD
working point depending on the application requirements.
3.3

Membership Function Deﬁnition

The initial deﬁnition of the membership functions is based on the expert knowledge and the observation of experimental data. After the initialization, a training algorithm updates the system in order to obtain a better deﬁnition of the
membership functions. Two-sided Gaussian membership functions were selected.
They are deﬁned as a combination of Gaussian functions
f (x; μ1 , σ1 , μ2 , σ2 ) = f1 (x; μ1 , σ1 )f2 (x; μ2 , σ2 )

Rule Base

The rule base consists of ten fuzzy rules which were trained using ANFIS [17].
It applies a combination of the least-squares method and the backpropagation
gradient descent method for training membership function parameters to emulate a given training data set. An study of the better conditions for the training processed was carried out using utterances of the Spanish SpeechDat-Car
(SDC) database [18]. This database contains 4914 recordings using close-talking
(channel 0) and distant microphones (channel 1) from more than 160 speakers. The ﬁles are categorized into three noisy conditions: quiet, low noisy and
highly noisy conditions, which represent diﬀerent driving conditions. Four different training sets were used: i) quiet ch1, ii) low ch1 iii) high ch1, and iv )
a combination of utterances from the three previous subsets. Training with
data from the three categories yielded the best results in speech/pause
discrimination.
Figure 4 shows the operation of the VAD on an utterance of the SpeechDatCar database recorded with the close talking and distant microphones. It shows
the eﬀectiveness of the fuzzy logic pattern matching for discriminating between
speech and non-speech even in a high noise environments.

database on the close-talking microphone. Figure 5 shows the ROC curves of
the proposed VAD and other frequently referred algorithms [20, 21, 19, 6] for
recordings from the distant microphone in quiet and high noisy conditions. The
working points of the ITU-T G.729, ETSI AMR and ETSI AFE VADs are
also included. The results show improvements in speech detection accuracy over
standard VADs and a representative set of recently reported VAD algorithms
[20, 21, 19, 6].

Conclusion

This paper showed the eﬀectiveness of fuzzy logic concepts for robust speech/
non-speech discrimination. The fuzzy system is based on a Sugeno inference
engine with membership functions deﬁned as combination of two Gaussian functions. The rule base consists of ten fuzzy if then statements deﬁned in terms of
the denoised subband signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and the zero crossing rates
(ZCRs). Its operation is optimized by means of a hybrid training algorithm
combining the least-squares method and the backpropagation gradient descent
method for training membership function parameters. With these and other innovations the proposed algorithms unveils signiﬁcant improvements over ITU-T
G.729, ETSI AMR and ETSI AFE standards as well as over VADs that deﬁne
the decision rule in terms of averaged subband speech features.
