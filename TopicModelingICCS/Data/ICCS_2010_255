Abstract
In order to investigate the positional effects of both –NH2 and –NO2 groups over the quantum chemical properties of
hexahelicene, sixteen different types of terminal donor/acceptor (–NH2/–NO2) disubstituted R–hexahelicenes (Hn, n = 1–16)
have been designed and theoretically investigated by DFT method at B3LYP/6–31G(d) level. The electronic and
thermodynamical properties and molecular orbitals of hexahelicene and all Hn compounds have been discussed. NICS(0)
calculations have been performed for all the rings of hexahelicene and Hn structures to inspect the aromaticities. It was observed
that generally the position of –NO2 (acceptor) was more effective over the quantum chemical properties of Hn structures than the
position of –NH2 (donor). However, –NH2 substitution at C5 carbon (in H4, H8, H12 and H16 compounds) increases the
aromaticities of terminal rings in a significant manner.

1. Introduction
Helicenes are screw–shaped benzologues of phenanthrene consisting of ortho–fused aromatic rings [1,2], of
which are chiral. A significant physical property of optical pure helicenes is their extraordinary ability to rotate
plane–polarized light [3]. This superchirality property provides helicenes to be used in applications such as photo–
optical switches [4] and enantioselective fluorescence detectors [5].
Hexahelicene ([6]helicene) was the first example to be synthesized and optically resolved by Newman and
Lednicer in 1956 [6]. Electronic circular dichroism (CD) of helicenes (n = 4í7, 12) was investigated by means of
adiabatic time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) [7]. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectrum of
heptahelicene was calculated theoretically by DFT method and compared with experimental results [8]. VCD study
within a Slater–type–orbital based density functional framework was performed over hexa– and heptahelicenes [9].
The second–order nonlinear optical properties of helicenes ([N]helicenes, N = 6–19) have been theoretically
investigated at the time–dependent Hartree–Fock level using the Austin model 1 semiíempirical Hamiltonian [10].

moment, ȕʜʜ , have been determined for increasingly large helical systems as well as their analogs substituted by
donor/acceptor pairs. Also the effect of prototypical –NH2/–NO2 donor/acceptor pair over some of the helicene
systems, containing hexahelicene, were investigated in the same study.
Photochemical investigations were done to determine the rate constants of radiationless S1ĺTn and T1ĺS0
intersystem crossing of tetra–, penta–, hexa–, hepta–, octa– and nonahelicenes [11]. In contrast to the linear groups,
the photophysical properties of the helicenes evolved steadily as a function of the number of ortho–fused benzene
rings.
Some quantum chemical studies on hexahelicene were reported [12–14]. Also chemistry of hexahelicene was
examined in some studies [12,15–19].
The practical synthesis of 1–azahexahelicene and 2–azahexahelicene have been succeeded [20]. Electron impact
(EI)–induced cyclizations of 1,16–diazahexahelicene, 1,14–diazahexahelicene and 3,14–diazahexahelicene to
monoazacoronenes were investigated through their mass spectra obtained with a four–sector mass spectrometer [21].
On the other hand, push–pull type compounds contain one or more electron–donating and electron–accepting
groups connected by a conjugated ʌ–system. Generally, the push–pull effect has a decisive influence on both the
dynamic behavior and chemical reactivity of this class of compounds and it is of considerable interest both to
determine and quantify the push–pull effect.
Except theoretically investigated optical properties [10] there is no other study on amino and nitro (donor and
acceptor) disubstituted hexahelicene systems neither experimentally nor theoretically in the literature. In the present
theoretical study, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations on hexahelicene and designed sixteen different
types of amino and nitro (donor and acceptor) disubstituted Hn (n = 1–16) hexahelicene compounds have been
performed. The electronic and thermodynamical properties, molecular orbitals and NICS(0) values of hexahelicene
and all the considered Hn compounds have been investigated and discussed. It has been aimed to clarify the
positional effects of both –NH2 and –NO2 substituents (or push–pull effect) on the quantum chemical properties of
hexahelicene molecule.
2. Method of calculation
The initial geometry optimizations leading to energy minima were achieved by using MM2 method followed by
semi–empirical PM3 self–consistent fields molecular orbital (SCF MO) method [22,23] at the restricted level [24,
25]. Then, geometry optimizations were achieved within the framework of density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP)
[26,27] at the restricted level [24] of 6–31G(d) basis set. The exchange term of B3LYP consists of hybrid Hartree–
Fock and local spin density (LSD) exchange functions with Becke’s gradient correlation to LSD exchange [27,28].
The correlation term of B3LYP consists of Vosko, Wilk, Nusair (VWN3) local correlation functional [29] and Lee,
Yang, Parr (LYP) correlation correction functional [30].
Single point calculations were done over DFT optimized structures using B3LYP method and 6–31G(d) basis set
in order to get vibrational analyses, total electronic energies and frontier molecular orbital energies. The normal
mode analysis for each compound yielded no imaginary frequencies which indicates that each compound has at least
a local minimum on the potential energy surface. The total electronic energies were corrected for zero point
vibrational energies (ZPVE). Heat of formations of all the molecules were calculated by a semi–empirical method,
PM3, based on DFT optimized geometries. All these computations were performed by using Spartan 06 package
program at standard conditions of 298.15 K and 1.00 atm [31].
NICS(0) calculations were done at B3LYP/6–31G(d,p) theoretical level of DFT method using Gaussian 03
software package [32].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry optimizations
Numbering of terminal atoms of designed Hn compounds is shown in Fig. 1. The presently considered
hexahelicenes (Hn, n = 1–16) possess an electron donating group (amino group) on one terminal ring and an
electron withdrawing group (nitro group) on the other terminal ring while changing their positions sequentially on
each terminal ring (Fig. 2). In the present study, all of the resultant structures are in R configuration
stereochemically. Fig. 2 shows the geometry optimized structure of these different sixteen Hn compounds calculated
at the theoretical level of B3LYP/6–31G(d).

3.2. Total energies
Total energy calculations done at the same theoretical level have revealed that all of the considered Hn structures
are stable (negative total energies). The relative total energies are given in Table 1. The most stable compound is H6
(with –790629 kcal/mol absolute total energy). H16 is the most unstable Hn compound with 16.65 kcal/mol.
Fig. 3 shows variation of the relative total energy as functions of variation of the –NH2 position in Hn
compounds. In each group, –NH2 substitutions at C3 and C4 carbons yielded more or less the same relative total
energies while that of C5 carbon yielded the highest. The most energetic group includes H13–H16 compounds in
which the –NO2 group was attached to C2' carbon. The attachment of –NO2 at positions C3' or C4' carbons yielded
the least energetic two groups containing H5–H12 compounds. It is observed that the structures having the same
–NH2 positions in C3'–NO2 or C4'–NO2 compounds do not differ much in energy. When compared, it is concluded
that variation of the –NO2 position was more effective over the relative total energies of the Hn compounds than
variation of the –NH2 position.
3.3. Heat of formations
A semi–empirical method, PM3, was applied over DFT optimized geometries of Hn compounds to calculate the
heat of formations in their gas phases. Note that PM3 method predicts heat of formation values successfully [33].
The calculations have demonstrated that (Table 1) all of the structures are endothermic (positive heat of formations).
The order of heat of formations of Hn compounds follow their total energy order (see Figs. 3 and 4). Fig. 4 shows
variation of the heat of formation versus position of the –NH2 in the considered Hn compounds. H16 compound is
the most unstable of all Hn compounds in terms of relative total energy and has the highest heat of formation value
of 134.40 kcal/mol (the most endothermic Hn structure, see Table 1 and Fig. 4). Whereas, H6 is the most stable one
(the minimum relative total energy) having the lowest heat of formation value of 114.72 kcal/mol (the least
endothermic Hn structure, see Table 1 and Fig. 4). Keeping the position of the –NH2 group, it is observed that
variation of the –NO2 positions affects the heat of formation values more intensly than the case of keeping the –NO2
positions fixed while changing the position of the –NH2 group.
3.4. NICS (0) calculations
Schleyer [34] proposed the use of absolute magnetic shieldings, computed at ring centers (nonweighted mean of
heavy atom coordinates) as a new aromaticity/antiaromaticity criterion. This method is named Nucleus Independent
Chemical Shifts, NICS, in which the computed values are reversed in sign. Negative NICS values denote
aromaticity, positive NICS antiaromaticity. It was demonstrated that NICS values were basis set dependent. The
comparison of NICS values of several compounds were performed by using 6–31+G(d) basis set. NICS values of

benzene and naphthalene were reported as –9.7 and –9.9 ppm, respectively. Phenanthrene which is a kind of ortho–
fused acene with three six–membered rings has values of –10.2 and –6.5 ppm for the outer rings and the inner ring,
respectively.
Presently, to investigate the local ring aromaticities, NICS(0) calculations have been performed over each six–
membered rings of hexahelicene and Hn hexahelicenes considered. The calculations were done at the theoretical
level of B3LYP/6–31G(d,p). The results (Table 2) have revealed that all of the rings are aromatic (negative NICS
values) but the aromaticities of terminal rings are higher than the others. Hexahelicene, with C1 point group, has
–10.3 ppm NICS value for the terminal rings whereas the values are sequentially –6.9 and –7.2 ppm for the inner
rings starting from any terminal ring. Terminally amino substituted rings of the Hn hexahelicenes (except H2) have
NICS values between (–9.9)–(–10.8) ppm. The NICS values for the inner rings decrease in absolute value and
change between (–5.8)–(–8.0) ppm. However, the NICS values for the nitro substituted terminal rings reach lower
(higher in absolute) values than that of the amino substituted ones (between (–10.6)–(–11.3) ppm). If we compare
with hexahelicene, the aromaticity differences between the terminal rings of Hn hexahelicenes are consistent with
the donor/acceptor properties of the substituents (or push–pull principle for donor and acceptor groups). Amino
group has an electron donating property and pushes the electrons towards the nitro substituted benzenoid ring of the
Hn hexahelicene compound. Amino group by donating electrons disturbes the electron population (shifts electrons
to the adjacent ring) as well as the cyclic conjugation of the ʌ–electrons of the ring where it is attached. Thus, those
amino substituted rings exhibit less aromatic character. Whereas, a nitro group having an electron withdrawing
property pulls the electrons towards itself preventing delocalization of ʌ–electrons to inner rings of the helicene
structure. Thus, the nitro substituted rings are more aromatic than the amino substituted ones. The differences
between two terminal rings could also be related to through space interaction between the rings and the attached
substituents due to their spatial proximity. The position of –NH2 substituent (for fixed –NO2 position of each
hexahelicene) affects the aromaticities of the terminal rings. In the set of structures, amino substitutions at C5 (in
H4, H8, H12 and H16) (see Figs .1 and 2) increase the aromaticities of the terminal amino and nitro substituted rings
in a significant manner.
It can be explained by looking into the C–NH2 and C–NO2 bond lengths of terminal amino and nitro substituted
rings in the set of structures (at B3LYP/6–31G(d) theoretical level), beside the effects of space interactions as
described earlier. In the groups of molecules that contain fixed –NO2 positions (in H1, H3, H4; H5–H8; H9–H12
and H13–H16), decrease in C–NH2 bond lengths (in H4, H8, H12 and H16) (Table 3) reflects the increased
conjugation of the lone pair of –NH2 group through the ring system which disturbs the circular delocalization of the
ring electrons. As a result more electrons are pushed from the amino substituted rings and pulled into the nitro
substituted rings.
3.5. Frontier molecular orbitals
The frontier molecular orbitals, the HOMO and LUMO (the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbitals, respectively) are the most important description in determining chemical reactivity and spectral properties
of molecules. In general, extended conjugation decreases the gap between the HOMO and LUMO, thus causing
bathochromic shift in UV–VIS absorbtion. On the other hand, electron donors push up and electron acceptors pull
down the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals [35]. Hexahelicene is a huge molecule having extended
conjugation. The effect of amino and nitro groups at different positions of hexahelicene is worth exploring to shed
some light on their spectral properties.
The HOMO and LUMO orbitals cover the entire hexahelicene structure. But generally in all cases, the half of the
Hn hexahelicene structure including amino group contributes to the HOMO whereas the other half including the
nitro group contributes to the LUMO.
The HOMO, LUMO, ǻİ (İLUMO – İHOMO) energies, Mulliken electronegativities, chemical hardnesses and dipole
moments of hexahelicene and Hn compounds are given in Table 4. Hexahelicene and all Hn structures have C1
symmetry.
Hexahelicene can said to be apolar (with 0.02 Debye dipole moment). All of the Hn compounds presently
considered are polar. The dipole moments of Hn structures change between 3.17–6.81 Debye but there is no obvious
regularity in the positional dependence of these values.
On the other hand, the chemical potential (μ) which is equal to –ȤM (Mulliken’s electronegativity) and Ș (absolute
or chemical hardness) are important concepts in reflecting chemical reactivity. The ȤM and Ș values are calculated
according to formulas given in ref. [36],

where I and A are the ionization potential and electron affinity, respectively. Note that I = – İ HOMO and A = – İ LUMO
within the validity of the Koopman’s theorem [37].
Inspection of Table 4 indicates that, in Hn series (n = 1–16), H6 and H7 have the highest (3.84 eV) whereas H14–
H16 have the lowest (3.54 eV) ȤM values. This means H6 and H7 appear to be the less susceptible specie to
oxidation whereas H14–H16 are the most susceptible ones (converse statement holds for reductions). The table also
shows the Ș values that H14 is characterized with the highest (1.55 eV) whereas H3 and H7 with the lowest (1.45
eV) Ș values in Hn series. Kinetic stability is dependent on chemical hardness [38–48] and it is known that the
harder the compound the higher the kinetic stability [38]. According to this, thermodynamically unstable H14
compound (Fig. 3) is the hardest and kinetically the most stable Hn structure whereas thermodynamically stable H3
and H7 compounds (Fig. 3) are the softest and kinetically the most unstable ones. Since the donor and acceptor
substituents are the same in all the Hn structures, the variations of ȤM and Ș within the series considered are all due
to positional effects. If we consider all the compounds of Table 4 including hexahelicene, we see that hexahelicene
has the lowest (3.45 eV) ȤM and the highest (1.98 eV) Ș value. So it is the most easily oxidizible and also kinetically
the most stable compound (thermodynamically the most unstable one with 163051.60 kcal/mol relative total
energy). However, it is worth mentioning that the LUMO energies are generally very dependent on the size of the
basis set used and its quality. Therefore, the results for both ȤM and Ș can contain some errors [36]. Fortunately,
relative values for a series of related molecules or a series of possible structures for a given molecule are often quite
reliable [36,37]. Inasmuch as ȤM and Ș values reported here are taken on relative basis, rather than absolute values,
the conclusions drawn are correct.

The present calculations over sixteen different types hexahelicenes having amino and nitro disubstitutions
(Hn, n = 1–16) showed that all of the structures were stable (negative absolute total energies) but endothermic in
nature (positive heat of formations) within the limitations of the theoretical level used. The quantum chemical
properties of Hn compounds were dependent on the positions of substituents, mainly on the –NO2 group. However,
the aromaticities of the terminal rings of Hn hexahelicenes increased predominantly by –NH2 substitutions at C5
carbon (in H4, H8, H12 and H16 compounds).
