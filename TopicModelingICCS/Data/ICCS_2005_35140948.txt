Abstract. Programmed ribosomal frameshifts are used frequently by RNA
viruses to synthesize a single fusion protein from two or more overlapping open
reading frames. Depending on the number of nucleotides shifted and the
direction of shifting, frameshifts are classified into –n and +n frameshifts, n
being the number of nucleotides shifted. Computational identification of
frameshift sites is in general very difficult since the sequences of frameshifting
cassettes are diverse and highly dependent on the organism. Most current
computational methods focus on predicting -1 frameshift sites only, and cannot
handle other types of frameshift sites. We previously developed a program
called FSFinder for predicting -1 and +1 frameshifts. As an extension of
FSFinder, we now present FSFinder2, which is capable of predicting frameshift
sites of general type, including user-defined models. We believe FSFinder2 is
the first program capable of predicting frameshift signals of general type, and
that it is a powerful and flexible tool for predicting genes that utilize alternative
decoding, and for analyzing frameshift sites.

1 Introduction
Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is involved in the expression of certain genes in
a wide range of organisms such as viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans
[1-4]. In this process the ribosome shifts to an alternative reading frame by one or a
few nucleotides at a specific site in a messenger RNA [5]. The most common of these
events requires the ribosome to shift to a codon that overlaps a codon in the existing
frame [6]. Frameshifts are classified into different types depending on the number of
nucleotides shifted and the shifting direction. The most common type is a -1
frameshift, in which the ribosome slips a single nucleotide in the upstream direction.
-1 frameshifting requires a slippery site and a stimulatory RNA structure. A spacer of
5-9 nucleotides separating the slippery site from the stimulatory RNA structure also
affects the probability of frameshifting. The slippery site generally consists of a
heptameric sequence of the form X XXY YYZ in the incoming 0-frame where X, Y
and Z can be the same nucleotide [7], but other slippery sequences differ from this

motif. The ribosome changes reading frame on these sequences. The stimulatory RNA
structure forms a secondary structure such as a pseudoknot or stem-loop. Ribosomal
pausing is generally believed to account for programmed frameshifting, but Kontos et
al. [8] consider that pausing is not sufficient to cause frameshifting.
+1 frameshifts are much less common than -1 frameshifts, but have been observed
in diverse organisms [6]. The prfB gene encoding release factor 2 in E.coli is a wellknown example [9, 10]. In RF2 frameshifting, a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is
observed upstream of the slippery sequence CUU URA C where R can be adenine or
guanine. Among other +1 frameshift sites, the frameshift signal of the ornithine
decarboxylase antizyme (oaz) gene encoding antizyme 1 consists of a slippery
sequence and a downstream RNA secondary structure such as a pseudoknot [11].
In previous work we developed a program called FSFinder (Frameshift Signal
Finder) for predicting -1 and +1 frameshift sites [12, 13]. Trials of FSFinder on ~190
genomic and partial DNA sequences showed that it predicted frameshift sites
efficiently and with greater sensitivity and specificity than other programs [14, 15,
16]. Although -1 and +1 frameshifts are the most frequently found frameshifts, other
types occur. This paper presents an extension of FSFinder that can handle frameshifts
of any type, including user-defined types. We believe this is the first program capable
of predicting frameshift signals of general type.

2 A Computational Model of Frameshifts
2.1 Basic Models of Frameshifts
Three types of frameshifts are considered as basic frameshifts and their models are
predefined: the -1 and +1 frameshifts for the peptide chain release factor B gene
encoding release factor 2 (RF2), and the +1 frameshift for the ornithine decarboxylase
antizyme (ODC antizyme). The models for these frameshifts consist of four
components: Shine-Dalgarno sequence, frameshift site, spacer and downstream
secondary structure (Fig. 1). FSFinder2 extends the previous models used in FSFinder
to incorporate a user-defined model. For the upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence,
FSFinder2 considers AGGA, GGGG, GGAG, AGGG and GGGA as well as classical
Shine-Dalgarno sequences such as GGAGG and GGGGG. For the slippery site of the
+1 frameshift, the sequence CUU URA C, where R is a purine (that is, either adenine
or guanine), is considered. For the downstream structure, H-type pseudoknots as well
as stem-loops are considered.
2.2 User-Defined Frameshift Models
As shown in Fig. 1, the three basic models can be defined by a combination of a few
components. We classify the components into four types.
y The pattern component represents a pattern of nucleotide characters like the
slippery site of the -1 frameshift model (first box in Fig. 1A). The pattern
characters are defined first, followed by the nucleotide characters that represent
the pattern characters.

y The signal component represents a nucleotide string such as Shine-Dalgarno
sequences, stop codons, or CUU URA C, UUU strings in a +1 frameshift model
(first and third boxes in Fig. 1B, and first and second boxes in Fig. 1C).
y The secondary structure components are simple stem-loops or pseudoknots, in
which only canonical pairs are considered (third box in Fig. 1A, and third box in
Fig. 1C).
y The counter component represents the number of nucleotide characters in the
specified region. This component is useful for finding regions with specific
nucleotide content such as those with high GC content.
Unlike the signal component, the pattern component can specify the number of
occurrences of a specific nucleotide. For example, the pattern of -1 frameshift signal
is X XXY YYZ in which X can be N (A,G,C,T), Y can be W (A or C), and Z can be
H (A, C, T). But, the first three nucleotides must be the same to each other, and the
next three nucleotides must be the same. If this pattern is defined using a signal
component N NNW WWH instead, there is no way of avoiding unwanted matches
such as C AGA TTA.
Flexible spacers are inserted between the components. With a combination of the
components of the four types users can define not only the basic models but also their
own models. An arbitrary number of the components in any order can appear in a
user-defined model.

prfB gene in E.coli. (C) +1 frameshift model of the oaz gene in eukaryotes

2.3 Algorithm for Predicting User-Defined Models
FSFinder2 has an algorithm to handle various user-defined models. Since an arbitrary
number of components can be included, the most important component should be
specified as a pivot by the user. Based on the user’s choice, FSFinder2 first finds
matches with the pivot component. It then finds matches to other components in each
direction from the pivot component, starting with the closer one to the pivot
component. For example, for a user-defined model in which components 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 appear in this order, and component 3 is the pivot, it finds components either in
the order of 3, 2, 1, 4, 5 or 3, 4, 5, 2, 1. Algorithm 1 shows a way of locating a userdefined model in genomic sequences.

3 Results and Discussion
Fig. 2 shows default models for the three basic frameshifts. These models can be
redefined in the edit panels of the four components. Each component has its own edit
panel that helps users easily define and modify their frameshift models (Fig. 3). The
basic models as well as user-defined models can be defined with any combination of
the four components. Fig. 4 shows an example of the graphical user interface of
FSFinder2 for finding a user-defined frameshift signal. User-defined models can be
saved in an XML file and loaded later as desired.

FSFinder2 focuses on finding frameshift sites in the overlapping regions of open
reading frames (ORF) since most known frameshift cassettes are found in the
overlapping regions of two ORFs [13]. Consider two ORFs of frames 0 and -1 in Fig.
4. The starting positions of the two ORFs are extended from their original start codons
to upstream stop codons (positions a and c in Fig. 4A). The extended regions a-b
and c-d of the two ORFs partially overlap at their termini if position a of frame -1
is to the left of position d of frame 0 and there exists a start codon in frame 0. The
highlighted region e of Fig. 4A is the overlapping region of the two ORFs. Our
definition of an overlapping region identifies a wider region than an actual
overlapping region since it is extended to the upstream stop codon. The reason for the
extended overlapping region of ORFs is to avoid missing possible frameshift sites.
We tested FSFinder2 on Shewanella algae, for which no frameshift signal is
known. A Shewanella algae is a mesophilic marine bacterium and plays an important
role in the turnover of inorganic material. It may also cause disease in humans [17].
We selected 11 contigs out of 113 contigs in the Shewanella algae, which are longer
than 100 Kb. The frameshift signals of Shewanella algae were divided into 6 types
with the help of expert biologists, and searched from the 11 contigs. As shown in
Table 1, FSFinder2 found 28 frameshift sites that exactly match to our defined

frameshift model (model not shown here) and 915 frameshift sites that partially match
to the defined model in the overlapping regions of open reading frames. There were
many other frameshift sites (955 exact matches and 24,572 partial matches to the
defined models) that were found in non-overlapping regions of open reading frames,
but there are likely to be false positives. Considering the shape and length of the
overlapping regions of open reading frames, at least 12 out of the 28 exact matches in
the overlapping regions are strong candidates of frameshift sites and the remaining 16
sites are also good candidates.

4 Conclusion
Understanding programmed ribosomal frameshifts is important because they are
related to biological phenomena such as fidelity of mRNA-tRNA binding, and some
genetic controls and enzyme activities. They are also involved in the expression of
certain genes in a wide range of organisms. However, identifying programmed
frameshifts is very difficult due to the diverse nature of the frameshift events. Existing
computational approaches focus on a certain type of frameshift only and cannot
handle frameshifts of variable type.
We have developed a program called FSFinder2 for predicting frameshift sites of
any type, including user-defined types. A user can define his or her frameshift model
with a combination of four components. The user-defined model can be saved in an
XML file and loaded later. FSFinder2 is currently being used to find unknown
frameshift sites in the Shewanella genome. Shewanella is a metal reducing bacterium

that can be used for cleaning-up polluted environments. We believe FSFinder2 is the
first program capable of predicting frameshift signals of general type.
