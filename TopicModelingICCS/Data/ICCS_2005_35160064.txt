Abstract. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are
performed of turbulent combustion of initially spherical ﬂame kernels.
The chemistry is described by a progress variable which is attached to
a ﬂamelet library. The inﬂuence of ﬂame stretch and curvature on the
local mass burning rate is studied and compared to an analytical model.
It is found that there is a good agreement between the simulations and
the model. Then approximations to the model are evaluated.

Motivation and Objectives

The present research is concerned with the direct numerical simulation (DNS)
and analysis of turbulent propagation of premixed ﬂame kernels. The simulations
are direct in the sense that the smallest scales of motion are fully resolved, while
the chemical kinetics are solved in advance and parameterized in a table by the
method of the ﬂamelet generated manifolds (FGM) [8]. The state of the reactions
are assumed to be directly linked to a single progress variable. The conservation
equation for this progress variable is solved using DNS, with the unclosed terms
coming from the table. This allows the use of detailed chemical kinetics without
having to solve the individual species conservation equations.
Flame stretch is an important parameter that is recognized to have a determining eﬀect on the burning velocity in premixed ﬂames. In the past this eﬀect
has not been taken into account in the ﬂamelet approach for turbulent combustion in a satisfying manner. The laminar burning velocity, which is largely
aﬀected by stretch, is an important parameter for modelling turbulent combustion. Flame stretch is also responsible for the creation of ﬂame surface area,
aﬀecting the consumption rate as well. In the turbulent case, stretch rates vary
signiﬁcantly in space and time. An expression for the stretch rate is derived
directly from its mass-based deﬁnition in [4],

On the basis of this deﬁnition, a model for the inﬂuence of stretch and curvature
on the mass burning rate has been developed. In a numerical study [5], it was
shown that this model, with a slight reformulation, shows good agreement with
calculations for spherically expanding laminar ﬂames. This formulation, for the
ratio of the actual mass burning rate at the inner layer, min , relative to the
unperturbed mass burning rate at the inner layer, m0in (for unity Lewis numbers),
reads

with the integral Karlovitz number being a function of ﬂame stretch (1), ﬂame

The integrals have to be taken over paths normal to the ﬂame and su , sb and
sin are the positions at the unburned side, the burned side and the inner layer,
respectively. The ﬂame surface area, σ, is related to the ﬂame curvature, κ, which
is related to the ﬂame normals, ni on the basis of the progress variable, Y,

In turbulent premixed combustion the total fuel consumption is a result of
the combined eﬀect of ﬂame surface increase and local modulation of the mass
burning rate. In this study the latter will be investigated on the basis of (3) and
possible parameterizations thereof, i.e. models for the Karlovitz integral, (4).

Methodology

Freely expanding ﬂames are modelled in a turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld using DNS. More
detailed information about the DNS program can be found in [1]. The fully
compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved supplemented by a conservation
equation for the progress variable. For this purpose the mass fraction of carbon
dioxide is used, which is monotonically increasing. Unity Lewis numbers are
assumed for all species in order to prevent diﬀerential diﬀusion eﬀects from
obscuring the direct eﬀects of stretch and curvature on the mass burning rate.

To make the DNS computations aﬀordable, the FGM method of [8] is used
to describe the reaction kinetics. FGM can be considered a combination of the
ﬂamelet approach and the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold (ILDM) method
[7] and is similar to the Flame Prolongation of ILDM (FPI) introduced in [3].
FGM is applied similarly to ILDM. However, the thermo-chemical data-base
is not generated by applying the usual steady-state relations, but by solving a
set of 1D convection-diﬀusion-reaction equations describing the internal ﬂamelet
structure. The main advantage of FGM is that diﬀusion processes, which are
important near the interface between the preheat zone and the reaction layer,
are taken into account. This leads to a very accurate method for (partially)
premixed ﬂames that uses fewer controlling variables than ILDM. The manifold
used in this paper is based on the GRI3.0 kinetic mechanism with 53 species
and 325 reversible reactions [9].
The initial conditions are a laminar spherical ﬂame superimposed on a turbulent ﬁeld. There is no forcing in the simulation, so the turbulence will decay
in time. The chemistry is chosen in relation to the large interest in the power
industry in lean premixed combustion engines and there is detailed knowledge of
its chemical kinetics. Therefore premixed combustion of a methane/air mixture
is used, with an equivalence ratio of φ = 0.7. The evolution of the initial laminar
spherical ﬂame kernel to the initial size in the DNS is calculated with detailed
chemistry with the CHEM1D code [2].

Results

The ﬁrst simulation, denoted C1, is a lean case with an equivalence ratio of
φ = 0.7, domain size of 12 mm, an initial ﬂame kernel radius of approximately
2.9 mm, turbulent ﬂuctuations of u = 0.4 m/s and a turbulence length scale
of t =1.15 mm. In order to allow for very mild perturbations, initially we
study the results at a time equal to 0.026τ , with τ = t /u = 2.9ms, taken
from the start of the simulation. The time of growth of the laminar ﬂame
kernel to the initial DNS size was about 5 ms. The burning velocity of a ﬂat
unstretched ﬂame with respect to the unburnt mixture is equal to s0L = 18.75
cm/s and the corresponding mass burning rate is m0 = 0.213 kg/m2 s. The
progress variable is taken to be the carbon dioxide mass fraction, normalized
with the maximum adiabatic value. At the left side of ﬁgure 1 is a cross section of the ﬁeld. The contours of the progress variable are deformed only very
mildly. It is observed that the scale of the vorticity patches are larger than
the integral ﬂame thickness. For this ﬁeld the mass burning rate is analyzed
as a reference case.
Additional analyses are performed in order to assess the basic model (4)
under varying physical conditions. The test cases are listed in table 1. In case
C2, the eﬀect of grid resolution is investigated. It is assumed that the FGM
method is valid in the ﬂamelet regime if the progress variable is approximated
with enough accuracy. Since all lengths scales of the gradients of primary

variables (i.e. the variables that are solved in the present DNS calcualations)
are of the same order, this will yield satisfactory solutions. In order to assess
the inﬂuence of the chemistry a stoichiometric case, C3, is selected, in which
the same ratio of the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations compared to the laminar
ﬂame speed, and the turbulent integral length scale compared to the initial
ﬂame thickness as used for cases C1 and C2. For the stoichiometric case at
unity Lewis numbers the burning velocity is s0L = 28.17 cm/s and the corresponding mass burning rate is m0 = 0.316 kg/m2 s. An additional case is given
by the simulation of an increased initial ﬂame kernel in a larger domain, C4.
Here also the eﬀective resolution is decreased. In addition, cases are chosen
with increased velocity ﬂuctuations and decreased length scales, cases C5 and
C6, respectively.
In the analysis, the stretch rate deﬁned by,
ρK =

is evaluated by using the relation for the local burning velocity sL ,

which is a consequence of the combination of the conservation equation for
Y with the kinematic equation for Y. The latter deﬁnes the ﬂame speed uif
and then the relation for the ﬂame velocity, uif = ui + sL ni , can be used to
arrive at (8).

Now the actual mass burning rate can be compared to model-values. This
is performed by looking for points in the domain that are close to the inner
layer and interpolate from there in the direction of positive and negative gradient of the progress variable, with steps of 1/20 times the gridsize. All relevant
variables are interpolated over these ﬂamelets and these ﬂamelets are analysed
to determine the burning velocity (8) and the model of the mass burning rate
given by (4). For the present simulations these analyses lead to lots of starting
points (e.g. for case C1: 52000) and thus resulting ﬂamelets. For case C1 the
correlation is depicted on the right side of ﬁgure 1. This shows that the model
is a relatively accurate description of the actual mass burning rate. Deviations
of the actual mass burning rate compared to the model (4) are given in table
2 for all six cases. It is seen that the mean error for all cases is about 0.01 or
less, with a root mean square value of 0.02 to 0.03 (without normalization). It
can be concluded that the model is a good description for all the present cases.
Moreover, the grid coarsening shows no real deterioration, indicating that all
cases are suﬃciently resolved.
Starting from this point approximations to (4) can be considered. First, one
can consider the case in which the surface area is taken to be constant, σ = σin
as used frequently in the literature,

An improved model can be constructed by assuming that the curvature is not a
function of the distance s, but that it remains constant equal to the inner layer
value κ = κin . By integrating (6) this yields for the surface
σ = exp (−κin (s − sin )).

(10)

A third approximation is that the iso-planes of the progress variable are concentric, either cylindrical or spherical yielding

in which ξ takes the value 2 for spherical curvature and 1 for cylindrical curvature. This has to be limited for distances s beyond the concentric origin,
s > ξ/κin , at which σ = 0.

The result of the approximations are given in table 3 for all cases. It is observed that the constant ﬂame surface conjecture gives rise to relatively large
error. There is a systematic over-prediction of about 0.05 (without normalization) of the mass burning rate with this model and the ﬂuctuations are of the
same order of magnitude. The other approximations give much better results.
For the mean diﬀerences the spherical approximation, ξ = 2, is superior compared to the cylindrical model, ξ = 1, and for most cases also compared to the
constant curvature model. However, this is not really substantiated when looking at the accompanying ﬂuctuations. For the better resolved cases, C1 and C3,
the mean diﬀerence is best predicted by the ξ = 2 model, but again the accompanying ﬂuctuations are much larger than the model deviation. This suggests
that it is not a real improvement. With respect to the ﬂuctuations it seems that
constant curvature gives the smallest deviations. Additionally, it can be observed
that the constant curvature estimation gives slight under-predictions, whereas
the concentric cases give systematic increased values of the mass burning rate.
Moreover it can be seen that the stoichiometric case (C3) gives the smallest deviations for any of the present approximations. This indicates that the choice of
progress variable for the lean case might not be the best choice.
For closer inspection of all realizations in the ﬁeld, case C6 is chosen in which
the deviations are largest. Correlation plots are shown in ﬁgure 2. For this case
the basic model does not deviate signiﬁcantly from the results in ﬁgure 1, the
only diﬀerence being that the range of values is extended more to the origin of
the plot. Moreover some features, as indicated above, are clearly reﬂected like

the under-prediction of the constant surface case. Furthermore the predictions of
the concentric cases are less robust compared to the constant curvature model.
The latter however gives deviations at small mass burning rates. This is also
observed, to a lesser degree, in the concentric spherical approximation. Near
the origin the cylindrical model seems to perform better. This is in agreement
with observations in [6], who found that at higher turbulence levels, curvature
in premixed turbulent combustion of ﬂame kernels tends to cylindrical modes of
deformation of the ﬂame front.
It is obvious that all models do not ﬁt to the true values because no local
information on the ﬂame geometry is taken into account in the approximations.
If local geometric information is taken into account a much better agreement
would be possible and will be a topic of further research. At larger times in
the evolution, e.g. case C6, it was found that the basic model (4), gives good
correlations (at t = 0.087τ mean deviation 0.08, rms values of 0.24), see ﬁgure 3,
whereas all approximations are starting to deteriorate severely. In this case the
curvatures have large values, the associated values of radii are within the ﬂame
thickness, δf , as shown in the ﬁgure (at the right).

Conclusions

From the previous results it can be concluded that the method of FGM in combination with DNS calculations looks very encouraging. It appears that the FGM
is a promising technique to reduce the chemistry and obtain accurate results for
the ﬂow, thermodynamics and species. However, apart from a validation in terms
of laminar burning velocity, a direct validation is not present for turbulent cases.
With respect to this, more validation is needed and the strategy for this will be
twofold. By applying a suitable kinetics model with a limited number of species,
a DNS can be conducted. This system can be reduced and validated directly
against the results of the detailed chemistry calculations. A second method is to
increase the dimension of the manifold. It must be studied how many controlling
variables are required for a certain accuracy of the predictions. This again can
be performed in the framework of the previously mentioned full chemistry DNS.
