Abstract. This paper is intended to serve as an introduction to genome
rearrangement and its use for inferring phylogenetic trees. We begin with
a brief description of the major players of the ﬁeld (chromosomes, genes,
etc.) and the types of mutations that can aﬀect them, focussing obviously
on genome rearrangement. This leads to a simple mathematical representation of the data (the order of the genes on the chromosomes), and
the operations that modify it (inversions, transpositions, and translocations).
We then consider the problem of inferring phylogenetic (evolutionary)
trees from genetic data. We brieﬂy present the two major approaches to
solve this problem. The ﬁrst one, called distance matrix method, relies on
the estimation of the evolutionary distance between each pair of species
considered. In the context of gene order data, a useful measure of evolutionary distance is the minimum number of basic operations needed to
transform the gene order of one species into that of another. This family
of algorithmic problems has been extensively studied, and we review the
major results in the ﬁeld.
The second approach to inferring phylogenetic trees consists of ﬁnding
a minimal Steiner tree in the space of the data considered, whose leaves
are the species of interest. This approach leads to much harder algorithmic problems. The main results obtained here are based on a simple
evolutionary metric, the number of breakpoints.
Throughout the paper, we report on various biological data analyses
done using the diﬀerent techniques discussed. We also point out some
interesting open problems and current research directions.

Introduction

Understanding and classifying the incredible diversity of living beings has been
the focus of much work, starting as early as in Ancient Greece. Since Darwin’s
thesis on evolution of species, we know that the diversity observed today is
the result of a long process in which speciation (the event where two groups of

organisms from one species slowly diverge until they form two diﬀerent, though
closely related, species) played a key role. The history of these speciation events
can be represented by a phylogenetic tree, where each leaf is labeled with a
contemporary species and where the internal nodes correspond to hypothetical
speciation events. Figure 1 illustrates the phylogenetic tree relating a group of
vertebrates.

The problem of inferring the phylogenetic tree connecting a set of species
is both of theoretical and practical importance. The problem has historically
been addressed by considering morphologic, anatomic or developmental traits:
species that have similar traits are likely to be closely related. However, for the
last 30 years, most phylogenetic inference has been based on the DNA sequence
of the species considered. The quantity of information contained in the genome
of an organism is several orders of magnitude larger than that contained in its
observable phenotype, and thus it potentially allows for a much more accurate
inference. The DNA sequence of diﬀerent organisms from diﬀerent species diﬀers
because of mutations that occurred since their last common ancestor. It is by
studying these mutations that one can hope to infer phylogenetic relationships.
This paper focuses on one speciﬁc type of mutations called genome rearrangement. In Section 2, we describe these mutations. In Section 3, we introduce the
problem of inferring phylogenetic trees, and describe two classes of approaches
that have been used.

Genome Rearrangement

The genome of an organism consists of a long string of DNA, cut into a small
number of segments called chromosomes. Genes are stretches of the DNA sequence that are responsible for encoding proteins. Each gene has an orientation,
either forward or backward, depending in which direction it is supposed to be

Evolutionary Puzzles: An Introduction to Genome Rearrangement

read. A chromosome can thus be abstracted as an ordered set of oriented genes.
Most higher organisms’ chromosomes are linear (their DNA sequence has a beginning and an end), but for lower organisms like bacteria, the chromosome is
circular (their DNA sequence has no beginning or end).
The most common and most studied mutations operating on DNA sequences
are local: they aﬀect only a very small stretch on DNA sequence. These mutations include nucleotide substitutions (where one nucleotide is substituted for
another), as well as nucleotide insertions and deletions. Most phylogenetic studies have been based on these types of mutations.
Genome rearrangement is a diﬀerent class of mutation aﬀecting very large
stretches of DNA sequence. A genome rearrangement occurs when a chromosome
breaks at two or more locations (called the breakpoints), and the pieces are
reassembled, but in the “wrong” order. This results in a DNA sequence that has
essentially the same features as the original sequence, except that the order of
these features has been modiﬁed.
If the chromosome breaks occur in non-functional sequence, the rearrangement is unlikely to have any deleterious eﬀects. On the other hand, a rearrangement whose breakpoints fall in functional sequence (e.g. genes) will almost certainly make the gene dysfunctional, rendering the oﬀspring unlikely to survive.
Consequently, almost all genome rearrangements that become ﬁxed in future
generations involve inter-genic breakpoints.
Figure 2 illustrates the three most common types of genome rearrangements.
The ﬁrst two, inversions and transpositions, aﬀect only one chromosome at a
time. The result of an inversion is to reverse the DNA segment between the two
breakpoints. The order of the genes on this segment is reversed and their orientation is inverted. A transposition involves three breakpoints: the DNA segment
between the two ﬁrst breakpoints is spliced out and re-inserted somewhere else
on the chromosome. A translocation involves two diﬀerent chromosomes that
exchange their ends.
The net eﬀect of any genome rearrangement is to modify the order of features
on a chromosome. The most important such features are genes, and most of the
research done in this ﬁeld has involved looking at genome rearrangement from
the point of view of their eﬀect on the gene order.
It is worth noticing that, compared to local mutations, genome rearrangements are extremely rare. However, over time, they accumulate and the order of
the genes on each chromosome becomes more and more scrambled with respect
to the original sequence. Thus, two closely related species will usually have similar gene orders (i.e. few genome rearrangements occurred during the evolution
that separates them), whereas the gene orders of two more distant species will
usually be less conserved.

Inferring Phylogenetic Trees

Inferring the phylogenetic (evolutionary) relationships among a set of species
is a problem of both pure scientiﬁc and practical interest. This relationship is

usually depicted using a phylogenetic tree, whose leaves are labeled with the
contemporary species under study, and whose internal structure indicates the
order in which order these species diverged from each other. In some case, lengths
will be associated with the branches of the tree. These lengths correspond to the
amount of evolution that happened between the two endpoints of the branch.
By far the most common way to do phylogenetic inference is to study the
evolution of DNA sequences from a local point of view. This approach has proven
quite successful and has allowed us to infer the phylogenetic relationships among
many species [14].
Gene arrangement can also be used to infer evolutionary relationships among
species. Because genome rearrangements occur much more rarely than local mutations, it often allows to trace relationships between very distant species. Moreover, the fact that most genome rearrangements seem to have no eﬀect at all on
the ﬁtness of the oﬀspring makes our task easier. Consequently, one should see
gene arrangement based studies as complimentary to sequence based studies.
3.1

Distance Matrix Methods

A ﬁrst class of methods used to infer phylogenetic trees is based on the ability
to estimate the amount of evolution that separates two species. Given species
S1 , S2 , ..., Sn with genomes G1 , G2 , ..., Gn , one can then compute the distance

Evolutionary Puzzles: An Introduction to Genome Rearrangement

1007

matrix D, with Dij = evolutionary distance between Gi and Gj . Notice that D
can be calculated using any type of data: morphologic similarity, DNA sequence,
gene arrangement, etc. Once the matrix D is computed, one ﬁnds the phylogenetic tree T and the length of each of its branches such that the distance between
Si and Sj on the tree T is as close as possible to that speciﬁed by D, according
to some criterion (for example, the sum of square of errors). This optimization
problem is NP-hard, but very good heuristics exist for trees with a small number
of species [14].
But one question remains: how to evaluate the amount of evolution between
two species? In our case, this translates to “how many rearrangements have
happened between the order of the genes in Gi and that in Gj ?”
It is obviously impossible to answer this question precisely: nobody was there
when these rearrangements occurred, and some early rearrangement may have
been undone later during evolution. Much research has been devoted to estimating rearrangement distance. The most popular distance measure between two
gene orders is the edit-distance, deﬁned as the smallest number of rearrangements needed to transform one gene order into the other. This measure is bound
to be an underestimation of the true number of events that occurred, but in
many cases it appears to be very close to the actual distance. In particular, as
long as the true distance between two gene orders is not too large compared to
the number of genes involved, the edit-distance will be very close to the true
distance.
The problem of computing the edit-distance between strings has challenged
computer scientists for a long time. Most of the research done regarding editdistance between genomes has been done under the rather strong assumption
that there is a known one-to-one correspondence between the genes of the two
genomes compared. That is, no gene is duplicated and both genomes contain
exactly the same set of genes (this can be obtained by ignoring some genes,
if needed). When the genome is made of only one chromosome, the two gene
orders can thus be assimilated to mathematical permutations, and the problem
becomes to transform one permutation into the other. If the orientation of the
genes is known, a sign (+ or -) is associated with each element of the permutation.
When the genomes considered are circular, the associated permutations are also
circular (i.e. the last and ﬁrst elements of the permutation are adjacent).
The problem of computing edit-distances between gene orders was ﬁrst studied by Watterson [15] and by Sankoﬀ [9], who considered edit-distance restricted
to inversions only. The most important result on computing edit-distance between permutations is a polynomial time algorithm to ﬁnd the inversion distance
between two signed permutations, due to Hannenhalli and Pevzner [7]. The algorithm can actually be generalized to ﬁnd the minimal sequence of inversions
and translocations between genomes containing more than one chromosome. An
exact description of that algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper. Given the
two permutations, the algorithm builds an edge-colored graph called the breakpoint graph. The minimal inversion distance is then given by the sum of four
terms, each measuring some property of the breakpoint graph (the simplest term

1008

M. Blanchette

is the number of connected components). The algorithm was later improved by
[8] to run in time quadratic in the length of the sequences.
Notice that the knowledge of the orientation of each gene on the sequence is
crucial to the time complexity of the algorithm. Indeed, the inversion distance
problem for two unsigned permutations was shown to be NP-hard in [5]. No
polynomial time algorithm for calculating the transposition distance is known,
nor is any complexity result. A 3/2-approximation algorithm is described in [1].
Most algorithmic work has focussed on one type of rearrangement at a time,
but nature doesn’t have this restriction. In some groups of species, rearrangements occurring appear to be strongly biased towards one type of rearrangement,
but most of the time, all three types of rearrangements can occur. Blanchette and
Sankoﬀ [4] have proposed a heuristic that computes the minimal-cost sequence
of rearrangement between two gene orders, where each type of rearrangement
is given a diﬀerent cost. In nature, rearrangements involving short stretches
of DNA seem to be more frequent than those involving longer segments. This
could be taken into account when computing the minimal cost solution. Finally,
it is believed that some inter-genic regions, called hot spots, are more prone
to chromosome break than others. If this information was available, one could
potentially use it to infer a more accurate evolutionary distance.
Edit-distance computation still oﬀers many open and challenging problems.
An important one is to generalize edit-distance computation to cases where
genomes contain duplicated genes, and to the case where there is no clear oneto-one correspondence between the genes in the two genomes. The problem thus
becomes an edit-distance problem on strings rather than on permutations.
Distance matrix methods have been used quite successfully to reconstruct
phylogenetic trees. Many studies have used organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts) genome to do their analysis. Organelles are small cellular structures that
have their own genome, distinct from the nuclear genome. This genome is usually
much smaller than the nuclear genome. For example, the mitochondrial genome
of most metazoans have the same set of 37 genes. However, the order of these
37 genes varies a lot, and that makes them good candidates for phylogenetic inference (see, for example, [4] and [13]). Chloroplast genome have also been used
for phylogenetic inference [6].
3.2

Reconstruction Methods

The distance matrix based inference methods are attractive because all they
require is the ability to compute pairwise distances. However, this approach also
has its downsides. First, the tree inferred doesn’t contain any information about
what the ancestral genomes looked like. In fact, it is likely that there is no
evolutionary scenario that can match the tree and the branch lengths inferred.
Second, the fact the tree is inferred from a n × n real number matrix means that
much of the data is left behind. One could potentially do a better job by doing
the tree inference directly using the data, without going ﬁrst through a distance
matrix.

Evolutionary Puzzles: An Introduction to Genome Rearrangement

This is exactly what reconstruction methods do. The problem is now framed
as a Steiner tree problem: ﬁnd the evolutionary scenario that most economically
explains the genomes observed. More precisely:
Given: a set of genomes G = {g1 , ..., gn }, each located in some metric space
< S, d > (for example, the space of all possible gene orders under some editdistance metric)
Find: the set of ancestral genomes A = {a1 , ..., an−2 }, where ai ∈ S ∀i, and an
unrooted
tree T = (G ∪ A, E) with leaves G and internal nodes A, such that
�
(vi ,vj )∈E d(vi , vj ) is minimized.
This problem is NP-hard for most interesting metric spaces. The diﬃculty
stems from two problems: i) there is a very large number of tree topologies, and
ii) for each tree topology, there is a huge number of possible choices as to how
locate the ancestral nodes. In fact, the very simpliﬁed Median problem, in which
n = 3 and there is only one ancestral node, is NP-hard, even for signed inversions
(for which the edit-distance computation is only of quadratic complexity). This
leaves little hope to solve interesting problems with a larger number of species.
However, good heuristics or approximation algorithms could be possible.
These rather depressing complexity results have motivated research towards
ﬁnding new, simpler metric spaces in which the Steiner tree problem would
be easier, while retaining as much biological relevance as possible. One such
metric is the number of breakpoints between two permutations A = a1 a2 ...an
and B = b1 b2 ...bn , which is deﬁned as the smallest number of places where the
chromosome A must be broken so that the pieces can be rearranged to form B.
Notice that the pair of adjacent genes ai , ai+1 in A needs to be broken only if ai
and ai+1 are not adjacent in B. When considering signed permutations, there
is a breakpoint between ai , ai+1 in A iﬀ neither ai follows ai+1 in B nor −ai+1
follows −ai in B.
The number of breakpoints between two permutations can trivially be computed in time O(n). This metric is not an edit-distance, but it has been shown
to be closely related to the actual number of rearrangement events between
two permutations [3]. Moreover, in many cases, diﬀerent types of genome rearrangement occur with unknown probabilities, which makes the use of (weighted)
edit-distance diﬃcult. The breakpoint metric is not based on any speciﬁc type of
rearrangement and thus can be applied without knowing anything about them.
Unfortunately, the Steiner tree problem under the number of breakpoint
metric, and even the Median problem, is still NP-hard [11]. However, in this
case, very good heuristics exist [12]. These heuristics rely on the ability to solve
the Median problem by reducing it to a Traveling Saleman Problem (TSP), in
which the number of cities is 2n. TSP is itself an NP-hard problem, but it has
been studied extensively, and very good heuristics have been developed [10].
This reduction allows one to solve quickly and optimally the Median problem
for genomes containing less than a few hundred genes.
We then use our ability to solve the Median problem to iteratively assign
near-optimal ancestral gene orders to the internal nodes of a ﬁxed topology tree.
Each tree topology is then evaluated in turn, and the topology requiring the

1010

smallest number of breakpoints is chosen. Eﬃcient programs were developed
using this heuristic (BPAnalysis [12], [3], GRAPPA [6]). These programs have
been used successfully for several phylogenetic inference based on mitochondrial
and chloroplast genomes, respectively.
Many interesting problems associated with reconstruction methods remain
to be considered. A few of them are outlined here. First, no good heuristic is
known for the Median problem for any of the important edit-distance metrics.
There is interesting theoretical and practical work to be done in that direction.
When considering the breakpoint metric, many issues remain. One of the
most important of them is how to solve the Median problem when some of
the input genomes have some genes missing, in which case the TSP reduction
breaks down. This is an extremely important case, because with many data sets,
the gene content of each genome is quite variable. The current approach is to
consider only genes that occur in each of the input genomes, but that obviously
throws away a lot of information that may be valuable for inferring the correct
phylogenetic tree.
The problem of generalizing algorithms from permutations (where there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the genes of two genomes) to strings (where
each gene can occur several times in one genome) is also of great interest in
the context of breakpoint distances. In fact, even the problem of computing the
number of breakpoints between two strings (deﬁned as the smallest number of
times you need to cut string A to be able to rearrange the pieces to form string
B), hasn’t been solved yet.

Conclusion

Genome rearrangement is a great source of interesting problems for computer
scientists. Inferring phylogenetic trees based on genome rearrangement often
translates into nice, clean algorithmic problems. Many of these problems remain
open. But genome rearrangements are not just puzzles for computer scientists.
Most algorithms developed in this ﬁeld have been applied to real biological data
and have given good insights about the evolution of the species considered. With
the various sequencing projects in progress, new data sets will become available.
For example, the genomes of more than 30 bacteria and archebacteria have now
been completely sequenced. These genomes contain more than 1000 genes each,
and will to take genome rearrangement studies to a whole new scale. The whole
genome of various higher organisms (worm, fruit ﬂy, human, mouse, etc.) is
also completely sequenced or close to being completed. These genomes contain
a few tens to thousands of genes, and promise new and interesting algorithmic
problems.
