Abstract. Fluid flow in most of geothermal reservoirs is dominated by fractures
and their distribution. In this study, the following process of cold water
injection into a fractured geothermal reservoir is considered: the cold water
from a injection well advances along the fractures and gradually extract heat
from the adjacent rock matrix, and eventually arrives at a production well. Both
analytical and finite element based numerical models are developed and applied
to investigate the temperature and/or pressure evolution in the above process,
and compared with each other.
Keywords: Fracture, analytical, Finite element, thermal-fluid flow.

1 Introduction
Fluid flow in most HDR/HFR geothermal reservoirs is dominated by fractures and
their distribution. How the fractures affect the heat transfer between the fluid and the
rock mass during injection process must be critically addressed. Several related
researches have been reported [1,2]. The existing analytical model discussed by
Bodvarsson [2,3] did not include the effect of conduction in fracture. In this paper, a
model is proposed that includes the effect of conduction in the fracture. To investigate
the advancement of the thermal fluid during the injection process into the fractured
reservoir system, both the analytical and the finite element based numerical methods
are developed and verified as follows through a simplified reservoir system consisting
of a horizontal fracture intersecting an injection well and a production well.

2 Analytical Solution
The analytical model considers an injection well penetrating a reservoir with equally
spaced horizontal fractures. Here, we assume the constant aperture H along the fractured
zone, the constant injection rate q and an impermeable rock matrix (see Fig. 1). The

differential equation governing the fluid temperature in the fracture can be derived by
satisfying the energy conservation in the fracture zone as

where s is the Laplace parameter and u , v is temperature variable in Laplace

Laplace domain, so a numerical inverter by Stehfest [4] is used here.

3 Finite Element Based Numerical Equations
From the above, the analytical solution is limited to the simplified ideal case. For
simulating the practical complicated geothermal reservoir system, the finite element
based numerical method is also developed. Numerical modeling of flow in
porous/fractured media requires the coupling of various processes associated with the
complex geological and hydrological setting of geothermal systems. For an example,
the processes in the reservoir involve transport of fluid, heat and chemical species. In
this research, the modeling will focus on coupling of fluid transport and heat transfer.

Generally, the Galerkin’s finite element method is applied to solve the above equation
to simulate the conventional thermo-fluid flow in the porous media. It is feasible
because the fluid flow in the conventional porous media is usually slow and thus the
Pelect number (

Pe = qh

k

with h being a characteristic length) is less then 1.

However, if convection is dominant, such as in the fracture zone of a fracture
dominated system, the Pelect number is normally much larger than 1, and the above
Galerkin formulation may suffer from spurious oscillations. So the Taylor-Galerkin
formulation [5]is utilized here.
The thermo-fluid flow coupling is governed by the Eqs.(6), (8) and (9), which
affect each other. The staggered method is applied here to treat this coupled problem
[6,7]. Considering the above boundary conditions, the finite element formulation for
fluid extra-pressure analysis can be deduced from Eq. (6) as

4 Practical Example
Geothermal energy manifests itself in spectacular fashion in many places on the
earth’s surface and has been widely recognized as a renewable green energy in the
world. Several countries have started the related projects for developing the Hot Dry
Rock (HDR) geothermal system which has been renamed as Hot Fractured Rock
(HFR) in Australia. The Cooper Basin is entirely covered by the Mesozoic Eromanga
Basin, where the measured surface heat flow is over 100mW/m2. Geodynamics
Limited is developing the first Australian HFR geothermal reservoir system there for
electricity generation. From the analysis of the microseismicity recorded during the
hydraulic stimulation through the drilled well Habanero 1, the geothermal reservoir
being developed in the Cooper Basin is determined as fracture dominated. The
fracture zone is estimated to spans 30m thickness along the vertical direction and is
composed of a main fracture and a high permeability rock mass, which is further
simplified as the following model (Figure 1) to be analysed by both the analytical and
finite element methods, in which the permeability of the 30m thick (D=15m) fracture
zone is taken as 10 microDarcy, while the transmissibility of the main fracture with
the aperture H=0.01m down the middle of the fracture zone is 1 Darcy metre; and the
temperature of injected fluid is 90 , the initial temperature of rock matrix is 260 .

4.1 The Analytical Result
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic picture of the basic model for the analytical study. The
following conditions are assumed here: Let the temperature in the vertical direction of
the main fracture be uniform; the rock matrix be impermeable; horizontal conduction
be neglected, and no heat flow along both the top and the bottom surfaces.

results of temperature variation during 30 to 70 years at X=400m and 500m (i.e. the
distance of from the injection well) respectively shown in Figs 2 and 3 , we see the

temperature of fluid in the fracture is almost the same as that of rock matrix after 30
years due to thermal conduction. Figs 4 and 5 show the fluid temperature variation at
different distances and times. After 70 years the temperature has decreased from
260 to 150 at the production point 500m away (Fig 5).

4.2 Finite Element Based Numerical Analysis
Most of the assumptions in the analytical case are not necessary for the numerical
analysis. The aperture H of the fracture is constant but the fluid flow rate q is not
constant, and the rock matrix is permeable, which is governed by Darcy equation.
Similar to the analytical model, a 500mx30mx1m 3D model with the main fracture of
H=0.01m in the middle is constructured and discretised into 20,000 8-node hexahedral
elements. The initial and boundary temperature conditions are the same as for the
analytical study. 70Mpa is set for the injection well and the pressure difference
between the injection and production well is 7Mpa. No thermal flow is assumed along
the other boundaries. All the parameters used here are listed in Table 2.

Figure 7 shows the pressure evolution at different times. The pressure varies
drastically at the beginning stage around the injecting well, but reaches a stable state
much more quickly than the temperature in Fig. 6, and then remains constant after
about 50 hours.
This can also be seen from the curves of fluid flow velocity vs time in Figure 10,
where the fluid velocity reaches a constant along the whole fracture at 50 hours.

positions and time. Around the production well, the temperature remains above 150
after 50 years(Fig. 8). Assuming an allowable maximum temperature decrease of 40
at the projection well, it will last up to 40 years as shown in Fig.9

5 Discussions and Conclusion
From the comparison of the above results from the analytical and the numerical
solutions, the temperature evolution is almost the same at the different time and
positions as shown in Figs 4 and 9, 5 and 8; the trend of both results is the same, but
the temperature decrease is faster in the numerical solution than in analytical. In the
analytical work, the assumption of an impermeable rock matrix was made and in the
numerical solution the rock is permeable, the fluid in porous can take over heat of
rock matrix. This demonstrates that (1) the assumptions made for the analytical
solution, such as constant flow, are correct for such a long term case, because the
fluid pressure/velocity reaches to a steady state in a very short time (about two days,
Figs 7 and 10); (2) the numerical algorithm proposed here for the thermo-fluid
coupling analysis works well; (3) The analytical solution is more suitable for a long
term analysis, but not applicable for transient and/or complicated fault geometry,
while the finite element based numerical analysis does well for the all the cases and
may also be applicable to transient complicated analysis.
