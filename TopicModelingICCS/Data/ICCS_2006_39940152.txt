Abstract. This paper proposes a novel MAC protocol adopting time division
duplex (TDD) technology for extending total subscribers at the expense of
downstream bandwidth in WDM/Ethernet passive optical network (WE-PON).
To compensate sacrificed downstream bandwidth, we employ an efficient
threshold decision and dynamic bandwidth (DBA) algorithm. Simulation results
show that the proposed MAC protocol improves queueing delay, link utilization
under asynchronous traffic conditions.

1 Introduction
WDM-PON provides unlimited capacity with the each user enough to accommodate
broadband multimedia services. Although WDM-PON is high-performance, it is difficult to be fully accepted today due to its luxurious cost. Therefore, WDM/TDM
hybrid PON is a compromising solution guaranteeing cost-effective and flexible upgrade from TDM to WDM [1]. This paper introduces WE-PON architecture as a kind
of WDM/TDM hybrid PON. In the WE-PON, single light source is reused at optical
network termination (ONT) to modulate upstream signals called loop-back method
for the efficient bidirectional transmission. Once adopting such a technology, splitting
ratio is considerably limited due to amplitude squeezing effect (ASE) at ONT [2]. To
address this problem, we propose an improved MAC protocol applying time division
TDD technology [3]. Consequently, maximum 16 subscribers per wavelength can be
serviced in the optical layer. But downstream bandwidth is inevitably taken away for
upstream traffic in the network layer. To compensate downstream bandwidth used for
up-traffic, threshold decision and dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm
efficiently response to user request in order to keep tack with almost close performance of ASE-based WE-PON that does not use a proposed method.

arrayed-waveguide gratings (AWGs). In the RN, downstream signals leaved
from 10 km feeder link pass out 1 and port 2 of circulator for the right direction and
then demultiplex 32 wavelengths for distributing signal power to 4 ONTs via optical power splitter (OPS). In the ONT, 25 percents of optical power splitted by OPS
are fed into receiver. Remaining 75 percents are reused to modulate upstream signals using ASE in RSOA. By using ASE mechanism to regenerate continuous
wave (CW) to be modulated for upstream traffic in reflective semiconductor optical
amplifiers (RSOA), strictly bounded power range of input signals should be allowed
to enter the RSOA. It limits splitting ratio to only four. To solve this problem, we
adopt TDD technology to the existing MAC protocol. As this scheme applies to
existing frame structure, no more reuse of modulated downstream signals
using ASE is need as well as maximum 16 subscribers per wavelength can be
achieved.

3 Proposed MAC Protocol
The basic downstream frame structure adopting TDD technology is shown in Fig. 2.
In this scheme, a part of the downstream area is shared with upstream bandwidth
granted for ONTs. Here the threshold is regarded as the amount of upstream
bandwidth. In this case, the length of upstream and downstream is evenly assigned,
which call fixed threshold adjustment (FTA). In general, we design all the control
message formats and collision avoidance mechanism among ONTs observe 802.3ah
EFM. Within the threshold, a GATE message corresponding to the ONT’s request,
vacant time window for the CW amount to the grant size of the ONT and guard
time are consecutively flow as a group to the ONT request. Contrast to FTA, the
range of threshold can be adaptively varied from 0 to 2ms according to
upstream request for ONTs, called adaptive threshold adjustment (ATA) shown
in fig. 3.
Once adopting given MAC protocol in the scheduler, we can not avoiding degrading performance. But well designed threshold decision and DBA algorithm can im-

prove system efficiency and capacity. Scheduling algorithm for determining the
threshold and a mount of grant under the DBA policy is shown in fig. 4.

4 Simulation Results
We simulate the performance of proposed MAC protocol using OPNET. We assume distance from OLT to ONTs is identically 10km. Link speed for downstream
and upstream transmission is set to 1Gbps. Guard time between adjacent frames is
let to 5us. Every ONT has a finite queue size, 20 Mbytes. Incoming Ethernet frame
uniformly distributed from 64 to 1518 byte. Fig.5 shows average queueing delay,
up-link utilization, and traffic scenario-based bandwidth efficiency for proposed
MAC protocol.
