Abstract. The identification problem of a complex dynamic object (DO)
condition in an extreme situation is considered. The analysis is carried out on
the basis of self-organising artificial neural network (ANN). The compression
of the measuring information about object dynamics is achieved with use of
cognitive structures. The procedure of identification is realised through
inference in intelligence system (IS) on unsinkability monitoring of ships and
marine vehicles.

1 Introduction
One of the most complicated problems in an estimation and prognosis of DO
behaviour in extreme conditions is the identification of a situation. The special
obstacles we have especially for floating DO at deriving a hole and flooding of
compartments. In these conditions there is a continuous modification of DO
behaviour and factors defining its interaction with environment.
The authors use some approaches for this important practical problem solution
[4,5]. The developed mechanism of a logic inference includes the various firmware
procedures (statistical analysis, researches of phase portraits, mathematical
modelling). However in conditions of indeterminacy and incompleteness of the initial
information such approach does not always give satisfactory results. The searching of
more effective situation identification methods has brought about ANN theory using
[5-7]. Neural network approach is successfully applied by the authors in problems
connected with knowledge formalisation and a multicriteria optimisation in IS of
marine DO control [5,6].
The novelty of the considered approach consists in the following:
‚àí the handling of the measuring information at feeding a signal on ANN input is
realised by cognitive graphics methods;
‚àí the raise of identification effectiveness is reached on a basis the analysis of
alternatives by comparison of results obtained on multilayer ANN models and
Kohonen‚Äôs self-organising maps;
‚àí results of identification are used as the firmware procedure of the mechanism of an
fuzzy logic inference.

2 Conceptual model
Let us consider a method of the automated synthesis of structure and definition of
ANN parameters. A problem solution of DO state identification is conducted on
realisation of a complex of indications formed on the basis of the information from
measuring system. It is supposed that the diagnosis areas in characteristic‚Äôs space are
noncompact. Nonempty intersection of the appropriate areas takes place. The concept
and approach provide construction of ANN structure adequately circumscribing
singularity of a researched situation. The sequence of transformation of the
information determines a solution of the following tasks:
‚Äì compression of the information and its representation as convenient input for ANN
perception;
‚Äì choice of ANN structure in conditions of a continuous modification of object
dynamics and environment;
‚Äì learning of ANN using sequence of extreme situations appropriate to classical
cases of flooding in the unsinkability theory.
In space of indications various areas of the diagnosis represent the considered
emergency condition. The correct recognition of situations by the developed
classification rule can be reached on the basis of work [4]. The ability ANN to selflearning and parallelism, intrinsic by it, allows to realise process of the emergency
analysis and prognosis in a real time scale.
ANN is represented as ‚Äúblack box‚Äù at problem formalisation. Exterior information
acts on its input. On output the desirable signal is realised as a vector of situation
characteristics. As preliminary researches have shown ANN is capable completely
transform behaviour of object dynamics modification and environment.
Transformation of the information algorithm at realisation of the inference
mechanism is submitted on a basis of production model [1,4,5]:

3 Cognitive structures
Solution of recognition problem through cognitive paradigm [8] was carried out for
an extreme situation connected to an estimation of emergency ship dynamics on the
waves by transformation of the information within the framework of formal-logic
description. Such approach allows to establish occurrence and development of
oscillatory regime of an emergency ship depending on character of flooding and level
of external excitation. The searching of the definite mapping model was carried out
through cognitive spiral. It allows "to compress" the initial information about nonlinear rolling with a casual changing of periods. The construction of cognitive spiral
on a random function leads to periods "justification" and transformation them to one
value by affine compression or stretching of researched function intervals up to the
given size.
Cognitive spiral, as the alternative to a phase portrait, carries in itself more that
information, which it is possible to allocate visually, were guided on the image
structure. To such information it is possible to refer a breadth of bands in a spiral, its
saturation by colour and frequency of change of a band of one colour by a band of
other colour. The important role can be played also asymmetry of the upper and lower
parts cognitive spiral and distribution of colour on angles close to 0 and 180 degrees.
The considered problem of recognition is connected to classification of "difficulty
separable" typical cases of flooding among five classical situations defined at an
estimation of damaged ship dynamics [4]. These situations are characterised by a
modification of a regenerating component of mathematical model of damaged ship
rolling. Among them it is necessary to separate second, third and fourth cases. The
first case is trivial enough: lack of a static roll at symmetric flooding and positive
initial metacentric height. In remaining emergency condition the ship always has a
heel on any board. It allows easily allocate the first case without use of complicated
inference procedures. As to the fifth case it is usually considered as a subset of fourth
case for which the close pictures of oscillatory driving are characterised.
Let‚Äôs describe distinctive singularities of researched cases:

‚Äì the second typical case. Cognitive structure has intensive dark bands. These bands
are divided smaller on a breadth by dark bands. The spiral is symmetric concerning
the upper and lower parts and has steady light area on angles close to 0 and 180
degrees.
‚Äì the third typical case. The basic difference by this cognitive structure is asymmetry
of the upper and lower parts of a spiral. Also lack of a neutral light band on angles
close to 0 and 180 degree is observed. Here there is no bright change of bands, as
in the second case, and the dominance of light tones in the lower part of a spiral is
marked.
‚Äì the fourth typical case. Cognitive spiral differs by symmetry and has of very poorly
light bands (actually there is an alternation more and less dark bands).
The examples of cognitive structures for cases 2 and 3 are submitted in a fig. 1.
The analysis of cognitive structures allows to allocate information for a
recognition. This problem is solved by a determination of the rational compromise
between two factors. On the one hand, it is necessary to have a maxima of
information for reaching the best classification. On the other hand, it is important to
reduce an information content on input in ANN in connection with reduction of
learning time and computer resources. The rational solution of this problem is
obtained by selection of characteristic slits on separate angles in cognitive spiral.
Typically there were slits on angles 90 and 270 degrees mapping frequency of change
of bands, their breadth and saturation by colour. For qualitative comparison it is
possible to use angles about 0 and 180 degrees, for example, ¬±10, 170 or 190 degrees.
Searching of rational paths of data transformation results in reviewing not of
realisations, but appropriate correlation functions or spectral densities constructed on
quasistationarity sites. As a result the constant number of input neurones is
established and ANN structure is determined. At that we have freedom in a choice of
realisation length depending on conditions of IS functioning reliability in extreme
situations estimation. For a raise of recognition accuracy and time reduction of ANN
learning from used realisations moving average is deleted. Correlation function for
the "cleared" data is calculated.

Fig. 1. Cognitive structure for flooding cases 2 (left image) and 3 (right image).

The comparison of spectral densities for considered flooding cases testifies to
possibility of its use in classification task. We have great visual distinction of
correlation functions in situations 2-4. Therefore their using is more preferable.

4 Multilayer neural network topology
ANN represents series connection K layers of formal neurones as a cone-shaped
configuration (fig.3). Each layer contains Q L =  .  neurones, which number in
regular intervals decreases with increasing of layer number. Each neuron or base
processor element (BPE) is characterised by a series connection of two components:
the linear converter (summator) of a many-dimensional input vector U in onedimensional output vector 6
of summator with weight coefficients

As the input information for a recognition are used both correlation functions, and
spectral densities of "cleared" slits of cognitive spirals. Despite of so different input
data, ANN has identical structure. The input layer has number of neurones
appropriate to number of points in a given image. The output layer has 3 neurones ‚Äì
on one neuron on each classified case. The activation functions is selected as follows:
or for all three layer the sigmoidal function is used; or first two hidden layers have
sigmoidal function, and third, output layer uses the modified linear function.
The configuration and the basic characteristics are contained in Table 1.

5 Competitive model ‚Äì Kohonen‚Äôs self-organising map
As have been shown in research [5] problems in classification of dynamically varying
situations can observed at practical realisation of multilayer ANN. The phase space
topology in such situations is kept stable only on the limited time intervals. It results
in unstable work of ANN. Competitive Kohonen‚Äôs model is used for this problem
solution [3].
The elimination of possibility of many-valued solution in a Kohonen‚Äôs map (fig.3)
is ensured through inclusion of additional structure to organise procedure of a
recognition by means of the mechanism called "competition". The limiting form of a
competition among group of neurones is the principle "winner takes all".

Kohonen‚Äôs learning algorithm. This algorithm uses tuning a neuron through
modification weights and new weight vector shaping. During process of cluster mesh
self-organising, whose weight vector "benefits" an input image (is closest to an input
image), choose by the winner. This mesh and the nearest neighbours change the
weights. At that the learning velocity takes as a slowly decreasing time function.

Fig. 3. Kohonen‚Äôs self-organizing map.
Searching of effective solutions has brought about use of an uncertainty at a
choice of weight coefficients, which are necessary for changing during learning.
Standard learning method allows to change weights only of gained neuron. In fuzzy
approach all weights are varying in according to output neurons activation which is
calculated for some given pattern on ANN input. Such approach allows more
precisely to adjust a weight matrix and to separate space of objects on classes.
In a considered classification task the uncertainty was used not only in learning,
but also in inference. If to implement a normalisation of output neurones activity, we
shall receive probabilities of acceptance of a hypothesis about a membership of an
image to a concrete class. The analogy to fuzzy logic allows to consider a Kohonen‚Äôs
self-organising map as a system for activation function construction of object. At that
offered by Kohonen the competition for organisation ANN keeps, but it is less
obvious at the fuzzy approach. The results of researches show, that at learning with
uncertainty elements the additional restrictions on the entry conditions are
superimposed. In particular, it is impossible to set identical columns in a weight
matrix. Otherwise, at lack of distinctions between weight factors, their modification at
the same activation of output neurones will happen completely equally. Therefore the
weight vectors can appear tuned on the same class.

6 ANN weight coefficients adjustment by means of genetic
algorithm
As a competitive strategy of ANN learning (both multilayer ANN and Kohonen‚Äôs
self-organising map) the genetic algorithm (GA) also has been used [2]. Let us note
features for global optimum searching in weight coefficients space:
‚Äì coordinates of weight coefficients were determined in range [‚Äì2;+2], and range
was divided by 255 parts;
‚Äì the chromosome coding was carried out with the help of Gray code;
‚Äì the chromosome suitability was calculated through the goal function 4 .

The population size was selected a priori from a practical reasons. As experiments
showed, GA demonstrates satisfactory results both in small and in large population
sizes. In a view to decrease evolution time the population size of 10 chromosomes
was set up for our problem. In every evolution step one-point crossover, mutation,
cyclic shift and selection proportionally suitability were realized. Probabilities of
genetic operators are shown in Table 2.

Learning with the help of GA took more time, than using of standard methods of
networks learning. It is necessary to note, that ANN with GA adjusted coefficients
recognizes the cognitive spirals no worse than ANN, trained by standard method. GA
advantages are:
‚Äì the algorithm is not adhered to concrete activation function, as the method "back
propagation" (function can be non-differentiable and even discontinuous);
‚Äì searching in all weight coefficients space;
‚Äì this is a stochastic searching.
Thus, GA is more universal algorithm of a global optimum search which besides
is easily realized on parallel architecture.

7 Results of experiments
For an estimation of ANN work efficiency was conducted possibility study of
received results using for deciding the practical problems of classification at IS
functioning. Research included a generation of real sea waves and interaction

modelling of an emergency ship with an environment through specially developed
tool of testing and debugging of IS functioning. This tool is complemented by
subroutines of construction and processing cognitive structures and ANN learning.
During research qualitative comparison of classification results for "short" and "long"
realisations of non-linear casual processes also was carried out. These processes
characterise on-board emergency ship rolling on the irregular waves.
Interesting results are received at the analysis of activation function influence for
speed of ANN weights convergence. So, for example, semilinear (modified linear)
activation functions
Ô£± 6 < 
Ô£¥
< = Ô£≤N6   ‚â§ 6 ‚â§  N 
Ô£¥
Ô£≥ 6 >  N 
may be not always used on all layers. At the same time, such function appears
suitable for a output layer where the hypothesis about type of flooding is finally
formed. Here semilinear function is limited and quickly reaches the maximal values.
Sigmoidal function well approaches for all other network layers (input and hidden).
Use of this function on output layer only increases learning time and practically does
not improve classification accuracy.
Research of realisation length influence is important for reduction of learning time
at network adaptation in a case when extreme situation development occurs during a
short time interval and quickly is necessary to estimate conditions and to arrange on
preservation of ship survivability.

In use of Kohonen‚Äôs self-organising maps on neural network input were given the
same correlation functions, as on multilayer ANN input. It has allowed to compare
results and to estimate efficiency used neural networks. As results of the research
have shown, Kohonen‚Äôs self-organising maps in some cases have the certain
advantage before multilayer networks. These advantages provide certain split of
situations and reference recognised object only to one concrete class. Besides
unsupervised learning has also other advantages. So, for example, at the second
typical flooding case a ship dynamics on irregular waves in conditions of the limited
disturbance may appear close to the third typical case. At supervised learning such
situation results in occurrence of learning mistake: some rolling realisations of an
emergency ship may be incorrectly classified. But if we use unsupervised learning,
such variant is joined to class of realisations of the third typical case. In result it is not
possible to avoid learning mistakes. Exit from the created situation is joint
classification on the basis of considered ANN. It allows essentially to increase
efficiency of recognition process.

Conclusions
The carried out research testifies to the big opportunities of ANN using in problems
of extreme situations identification under continuously varied conditions of DO
interaction with environment. Quality of ANN functioning is achieved due to change
of principles of work and formation of the criteria providing flexibility and ability of

adaptation to external conditions. In result the information technology of major
practical problem decision is developed. This technology provides safety of ship and
marine vehicles at compartments flooding.
