Abstract. A new method is developed to solve the condensation equation as it relates to Air Quality Models using both semi-Lagrangian and
Lagrangian ﬂuxes to increase resolution and perform accurately under
stringent conditions that occur in the atmosphere. The new method,
Partitioned Flux Integrated Semi-Lagrangian Method (PFISLM), can
be used with lower-order interpolators and they produce highly accurate
results. PFISLM is positive deﬁnite, peak retentive, mass conservative,
and suppresses oscillations. Research indicates the diﬀerences between
PFISLM and other traditional ﬂux integrated semi-Lagrangian methods
are signiﬁcant when solving the aerosol condensation/evaporation equation. PFISLM is created to handle speciﬁc diﬃculties associated with
the time and space discretization of the aerosol operator in air quality
models.

Introduction

Air quality models that include aerosol dynamics often employ the continuous
distribution approach (Pilinis, 1990) to represent aerosols undergoing evaporation and condensation. The fundamental equation governing the condensation
process for an internally mixed aerosol is derived in Pilinis (1990). The equation
is given as
1 ∂Hpi
∂pi
,
(1)
= Hi p −

where pi , Hi , µ, p =
i pi , and H =
i Hi are the mass distribution of
species i, mass transfer rate of species i, log of the diameter of the particle,
total concentrations, and total mass transfer rates respectively with n being the
number of aerosol compounds.
Typically, Equation (1) is solved by means of operator splitting into two
parts: the growth,
∂pi
= Hi p,
(2)
∂t
and the redistribution,

The Algorithm
Aerosol Redistribution

PFISLM uses both semi-Lagrangian ﬂuxes and Lagrangian positions to resolve
the space discretization. A graphical representation of the new scheme is shown
in Figure 1. A typical semi-Lagrangian ﬂux is the mass that is contained from
the semi-Lagrangian position of the cell interface, (µ1 ) to the cell interface, (µ2 ).

Fig. 1. Partitioned Flux Integrated Semi-Lagrangian Method uses both the SemiLagrangian and Lagrangian position of cell interfaces in its computation. The ﬂux
leaving cell interface I is not averaged into cell I+1 but is recorded into the partition
deﬁned from µ2 and µ3 .

The evacuated semi-Lagrangian ﬂux enters the partition deﬁned by the cell
interface, (µ2 ) and the Lagrangian position, (µ3 ). This area from (µ2 ) to (µ3 )

is known as a partition. Since, the total mass in cell I + 1 is known, the distribution inside each cell is further resolved. Namely, the mass occupied by the
ﬁrst partition, µ2 to µ3 , is p1 = FI , the mass occupied by the second partition,
µ3 to µ4 , is p2 = pi (t), and the mass occupied by the third partition from µ4
to µ5 is p3 = FII . In the next time step, the mass distribution inside cell I + 1
is interpolated (using both linear and quadratic interpolators) more accurately
because more information is available to describe the mass partitioning inside
the cell due to the Lagrangian partitioning. Depending on the mass transfer rate,
each cell can have up to three partitions.

Aerosol Growth

The growth term given in Equation (2), is computed from a mass balance and
the growth law. The growth is computed for the entire cell and is distributed to
the enclosed partitions accordingly. The growth for the entire cell is found by a
direct integration of the growth equations,
∂pi
= Hi p

The mass increase or decrease in each partition is computed by solving a
simple set of equations that represents mass conservation, the solution to the
growth equation, and the contribution of the cell growth from each partition in
accordance to its relative mass to the entire cell. That set of equations is given
as

by partition j, massgrowthj is the growth of the mass in partition j, pi is
the concentration in the entire cell, and pj is the concentration in partition j.
Substituting massgrowthj = growthj Δµj , massgrowth = growthΔµ,
and massj = pj Δµj into Equation (12), the solution to the growth term in each
partition is obtained as,

Numerical Test

There were hundreds of test perform in order to gauge the accuracy of the solver.
For the sake of brevity, here we will report on one of them. The test consists on
200 iterations of back and forth condensation and evaporations of a given aerosol
distribution using 12 ﬁxed bins. The rate of evaporation and condensations is
constant. Therefore, the ﬁnal solution is expected to equal the initial conditions.
Figure 2 shows that results are signiﬁcantly less diﬀusive than those produced by
Bott’s solver (Bott, 1989) which is currently used in several air quality models.
The numerical test uses the following initial conditions:

Conclusions

A new approach to solving the condensation equation is developed to handle
these diﬃcult characteristics of the aerosol operator. The new method is mass
conservative, positive deﬁnite, peak retentive, and suppresses oscillations. The
approach is a super set of ﬂux integrated semi-Lagrangian methods using both
semi-Lagrangian and Lagrangian ﬂuxes. It eﬀectively increases the resolution
of the bins by keeping information about the partitions inside each bin. This
increased resolution permits accurate representation of the actual dynamics of
aerosols, especially with limited number of bins.
