Abstract
We present a dynamical binary opinion model for the emergence of collective decision making based on a generalization of the majority and the minority principle. The network consists of N interacting agents, whose connectivity
structure is dynamic, governed by a rewiring process controlled by the actual network state. With the aid of damage
spreading techniques we show how the dynamical stability of these models can be largely enhanced by self-organized
feedback loops between the network topology and the intrinsic network dynamics. The model provides possible explanations for social behaviour, in particular for the stability and instability of the individual and global opinion during
an electoral campaign.
Keywords: Complex binary decision networks, Opinion dynamics, Damage spreading

1. Introduction
There has always been considerable interest of theoretical physicists in complex phenomena departing from the
traditional avenue of physics research. In particular, the application of statistical physics methods to social phenomena
such as opinion formation and economic dynamics has been rather fruitful during the last few years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
However, the major part of well established earlier work in sociophysics has been devoted to static network architectures, while real-life networks are usually dynamic with respect to their topology [6, 7, 8, 9]. Moreover, topologic
dynamics are often network-intrinsic and quite inhomogeneous, where the evolution of time-dependent connectivity
structures is in general not that well understood. The present study extends the analysis of the dynamics of randomly
assembled threshold networks to social phenomena ﬁrst introduced by Galam [2, 3] to ﬂexible network architectures
as well as to damage spreading techniques successfully applied earlier. Here the existence of two dynamical phases
was established: a stable phase, where the system is resistent to damage spreading and a chaotic phase, where an
initially small damage can spread all over the system [10, 11]. In the context of sociophysics this may help to understand under which conditions special shocking events or propaganda are able to inﬂuence the results of elections. In
this model, individuals gather in groups of ﬁxed size K, where K randomly chosen agents discuss a topic in order to
arrive at a ﬁnal decision, in favor or against. The model thus describes how people convince each other by expressing
their desire to identify themselves with certain social groups or to diﬀerentiate themselves from them. In particular,
we study the eﬀects of opportunistic and contrarian interactions guided by Galam’s opinion dynamics model, where

in the absence of opportunists (contrarians), the dynamics is ordered and leads to stable conﬁgurations. In contrast,
coupled systems exhibit a dynamical phase transition to disordered dynamics.
2. A general model of discrete opinions
The model network consists of a population of N agents of a democratic community who have a speciﬁc opinion
on a particular subject. The opinion of agent i is described by an Ising spin variable σi only capable to take the value
+1 or −1, i.e. to say YES and NO, to buy or not to buy, or to vote Party A or Party B, respectively. We assume that
each agent i can be inﬂuenced by K randomly chosen agents of the system with 1 ≤ K ≤ N. The dynamical rule
governing the time evolution of the network is, whether agent i will say YES or NO, is given by the linear threshold
rule

⎜⎜⎜
⎜
i = 1, ..., N .
(1)
σi (t + 1) = sgn ⎜⎜⎝ ci j σ j (t) + hi ⎟⎟⎟⎠
j=1

The coupling coeﬃcients ci j , usually not symmetric with respect to the interchange of the subscripts, deﬁne the
interaction strength between agent i and agent j. These “weights” ci j can be classiﬁed according to “Activating”
inﬂuences (A) (ci j > 0) associated with opportunistic behaviour, where agent i is stimulated to adopt the opinion of
agent j. On the other hand, “Inhibiting” inﬂuences (I) (ci j < 0) can be associated with contrarian behaviour, where
agent i is stimulated to adopt the opinion opposite to the actual choice of agent j. The coupling coeﬃcient is zero, if
agent j does not inﬂuence agent i at all. The quantity hi represents a threshold which can be thought of as an external
ﬁeld acting on agent i associated with mass media, public relations, targeted propaganda, or personal preferences
toward either orientation. A large positive threshold hi favours a YES state, while a negative threshold hi favours a
NO state of agent i. The time evolution of the N-dimensional opinion vector
σ(t) = (σ1 (t), σ2 (t), ..., σN (t)),

(2)

could describe the state of a discussion at time t, where each agent expresses its opinion in order to arrive at a ﬁnal
decision, YES or NO.
Let us now assume that a fraction p of the agents adopt the opinion contradictory to the preveiling opinions of
others and obey a local minority rule, while the fraction 1 − p of the agents follow the current trend and obey the
local majority rule. [2] The latter group can be considered as opportunists or trend followers, while the ﬁrst group
can be thought of as contrarians who are quite common in social societies. The implications of their existence have
long been studied in the context of ﬁnancial market strategies, where this group plays an important role. For this
special case, where the interactions consist only of these two fundamental rules of behaviour, we choose ci j = 1 for all
incoming connections for the opportunists, and ci j = −1 for the contrarians, respectively. The individual thresholds
hi are set to zero. The majority rule is employed in a number of settings, such as elections, board meeting votes, and
legislative votes, where eventually one has only one winner. Many democratic societies use the majority rule in local
and international elections.
3. Decisive macroscopic variables
There are three crucial macroscopic variables which characterize the dynamical behaviour of the system. The ﬁrst
one is the public opinion at time t, the density of “ones” which deﬁnes the acceptance rate of the YES or NO state
given by the total magnetization

m(t) =
(σ j (t) + 1).
(3)
2N i=1
The second macroscopic variable speciﬁes how small local perturbations inﬂuence the time evolution of the network.
Such a perturbation could be speciﬁed by switching the opinion variable of only one or a few randomly selected agents
from YES to NO or vice versa. In order to study these eﬀects, one considers two identical replicas of the system and

speciﬁes the fraction of agents who diﬀer in their opinion at time t. Provided that this probability d(t) is suﬃciently
low, the system can be placed into the stable phase. While in biological networks the stability is a necessary requirement for the survival of a system, in opinion networks a slight perturbation of a few agents should not aﬀect a
substantial part of the other agents. A complementary measure of the opinion stability based on the individual level
can be speciﬁed by the third macroscopic quantity, the fraction of agents who change their opinion from one time step
to the next by the quantity D(t) deﬁned by
D(t) =

As has been seen in various electoral campaigns up to about one third of the respondents change their opinion at
least once during the campaign [12]. However, note that individual changes in one direction are often cancelled by
individual changes in the opposite direction. These fundamental macroscopic quantities can be calculated exactly in
the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ [4, 5] with the aid of pure statistical methods via mean-ﬁeld techniques.
Let us ﬁrst shortly review some results of the basic version of the model [4], where the agents meet in groups
of the same size K and the connectivity structure remains ﬁxed. Fig.1 depicts the analytically predicted long-time
behaviour of the magnetization m∗ (black line) and the distance d∗ (red line) for K = 9 within meanﬁeld theory [6].
Due to symmetry properties the “ﬁfty-ﬁfty” outcome, the “tie” situation (m∗ = 12 ) is always a natural ﬁxed point of
the magnetization m(t), the acceptance rate of the YES or NO. Eventually this stationary solution loses its stability

the system can reach one of the two stable ﬁxed points - symmetric to 2 - which specify a preference for the YES or

stable, is somewhat lower than the corresponding critical value for the magnetization pm
c [6, 7]. However, when the
system is in the “tie” situation one can show that also the Hamming distance d(t) (Eq. 4) has the stable ﬁxed point
d∗ = 12 which makes the system unstable with respect to small perturbations [4, 5]. Moreover, provided that only one
single agent changes its opinion at an arbitrary time step t, this perturbation can propagate such that in the long time
limit 50% of the agents will have changed their opinion. Around the tie we ﬁnd Gaussian ﬂuctuations such that the
outcome becomes essentially random. Note however that the magnetization, the acceptance rate of the YES and the
NO, is stable, since the individual changes of the votes of the agents cancel out.
It is important to note that also the macroscopic quantity D(t) (Eq. (5)), the distance of the individual opinions with
respect to consecutive time steps, follows the same asymptotics as the Hamming distance between the two replicas
d(t) such that about 50% percent of the of the agents change their opinion from one time step to the next. We can
conclude that in the whole parameter range of the “tie” the model does does not reﬂect the real life situation, while
below the critical concentration pm
c the model is more realistic [12]. Note that for increasing values of K the critical
concentrations shift to higher values of p and tand to the value 12 such that the system is globally stable. In the large
K-limit we ﬁnd [5]

However, for small group sizes K one needs a substantial fraction of the opportunists in order to stabilize the system.
4. History-dependent rewiring procedure
The ﬁrst decisive step towards a “dynamical” network model with activity-dependent coupling coeﬃciens was
Hebb’s classical articulation of the concept of “correlated self-organization” in biological neural networks [13]. His
classical postulate that the eﬃcacy of an excitatory synapse increases when the two neurons it links ﬁre simultaneously,
was later translated into various mathematical formulations, specifying the modiﬁcation of a synaptic weight in proportion to the correlation of the values of the two units. In summary the conclusion was that self-organization, adaption
as well as learning eﬀects might be based on the same mechanism, which can be formulated in terms of a few simple
rules formally closely related to those postulated by Hebb. Following the principle “what ﬁres together will wire together” we suggest the following possible rewiring rule designed to demonstrate its eﬀectiveness in gradually leading

two agents i and j measured within T consecutive time steps via
Ci j (T ) =

with −1 ≤ Ci j (T ) ≤ 1. The rewiring procedure is then speciﬁed as follows:
• Choose randomly a pair of agents i and j which are not connected
• provided that |Ci j (T )| exceeds a threshold value after T time steps, create a new directed bond ci j linking agent
j to agent i with probability q. Here the sign of the pair correlation speciﬁes the the sign of new eﬃciency
ci j = Sign(Ci j (T )).
• Delete randomly an existing bond ci j with probability 1 − q
Note that the rewiring parameter q allows to let the average connectivity of the network grow or decrease. The choice
q = 12 does not aﬀect the average connectivity. Positive pair correlations Ci j (T ) induce activating couplings, while
negative correlations induce inhibiting couplings, respectively. The network dynamics now has two timescales: a slow
local change of the connectivity compared to the faster time evolution of the states of the agents. Such a rewiring step
is local in space, since the change depends only on the states of the agents i and j, whereas with respect to time a
rewiring step depends strongly on the states of the two agents i and j in the past. Initially, a specimen net is assembled
with random connectivity structure which places it in the disordered phase, while the interactions are based only on
the two fundamental rules, the majority and the minority rule. Fig. 2 depicts the magnetization m(t) and the Hamming
distance d(t) as a function of the number of the rewiring steps for N = 1000 agents and control parameter T = 50,
which speciﬁes the timescale of the rewiring process. Note however, that the simulations reveal that the results are
not that much sensitive to the choice of T . We observe that with increasing number of rewiring steps the Hamming
distance d(t) gradually decreases and that there exists a critical number of rewiring steps, where a phase transition

with 0 ≤ C(T ) ≤ 1. Notice that with increasing number of rewiring steps the correlation coeﬃcient C(T ) gradually
increases and ﬁnally tends to approach the value one signalling that the time evolution of the evolving networks might
reach a ﬁxed point such that the systems are well stabilized. Fig. 4 shows the ﬁnal in-degree distribution as well as
the out-degree distribution of the couplings after the rewiring process. Starting from a Dirac-like distribution, where
all units have the same number of neighbors, we observe that with increasing rewiring steps the in-degree as well as
the out-degree distribution broadens remarkably, reminiscent of a heavier tail after suﬃciently many rewiring steps.
5. Summary
We have shown that the stability of a binary network model governed by a subtle balance of opportunists and
contrarians can be largely enhanced by a local rewiring strategy motivated by generalized Hebbian rules widely used
in neural network models. We infer that this mechanism might also be applicable to various biological systems such as
genetic and population dynamical networks. Finally the “tie” phenomenon associated with instability, usually present
in static networks, could be overcome by an activity dependent rewiring process such that these pathologic networks
can even be stabilized in a ﬁfty-ﬁfty situation.
