Abstract. This paper presents a new method for rotation invariant texture
classification based on the circular Gabor wavelets. A circular Gabor filter
bank is proposed to decompose an image into multiple scales and be rotation
invariant. By the mean and variance of the circular Gabor filtered image, a
discriminant can be found to classify rotated images. In the primary experiments, comparatively high correct classification rates were obtained using a
large test sample set.

1 Introduction
Texture analysis is a fundamental issue in image analysis and computer vision. The
Gabor function can be appropriately considered as an orientation and scale tunable
detector. The banks of Gabor filters are a group of wavelets, which one can capture
the signal or feature at a specific frequency and a specific orientation. There are several approaches based on Gabor filters, which focus on the rotation invariant texture
in [1-3]. But, most of them only work well on a small database and need a lot of samples for training.
The motivation of this paper is to classify rotation-invariant textures in a large texture database. The proposed algorithm is based on circular Gabor filter responses, in
which each texture has the corresponding global features. Then, a similarity measure
is used to compare the unknown samples with the feature of known textures. The
primary experiments have proven this approach performs well in applications.

2 Circular Gabor Wavelet and Classification
For the filter to be rotation invariant, it is necessary that the sinusoidal grating varies
in all orientations. In the circular Gabor filter, both Gaussian and grating vary only in
a radial direction from origin, such that the filter is completely circularly symmetric.
The circular Gabor filter is defined as[1]:

2.1 Circular Gabor Wavelet and Parameter Selection
A class of self-similar functions like the wavelet is considered as the circular Gabor
filter bank or circular Gabor wavelet in the following discussion. Let Cg ( x, y ) be
the mother Gabor wavelet, then this self-similar filter dictionary can be obtained by
appropriate dilations and rotations of Cg ( x, y ) through the generating function:

Cg m ( x, y ) = a − m Cg ( x' , y ' ) , a > 1 , m = 1,…, S
(3)

x ' = a − m x , and y ' = a − m y
−m

Where a is a scale factor, and the factor a
is meant to ensure that the energy is
independent of m . S is the number of scales in the multiresolution decomposition.
Let

Wl and Wh denote the lower and upper center frequencies of interest. Then,

the design strategy is to ensure that the half peak magnitude cross-sections of the filter
responses in the frequency spectrum touch each other. This results in the following
formulas for computing the filter parameters σ and W :

a = (Wh Wl )

2.2 Texture Representation and Rotation Invariant Measurement
Given an image I ( x, y ) of size
given by convolution:

M ∗ N , its discrete circular Gabor transform is

H m ( x, y ) = ∑∑ I ( x − p, y − q )Cg m∗ ( p, q ) , m = 1,…, S
p

Where

q

p , q is the filter mask size, Cg m∗ ( p, q ) is the complex conjugate of Cg m .

construct global features to represent the homogeneous textures.

Actually, the texture similarity measurement is accomplished by defining the differential measurement:

df = min(df σ ∗ df μ ∗ df D )
This similarity measurement is rotation invariant, and is smallest if

3 Experiments
The experiments are carried out on a texture database from the Brodatz texture album,
which is comprised of 111 texture images. Each center portion of size 256 × 256
from each respective texture image is used in the training phase. Texture classification
is done with a total of 1998 rotated texture images in steps of 10 up to 180 for
various scale values of Gabor decomposition (scale is from 2 up to 10). The center
frequencies for Gabor filters are 0.02-0.48 and are separated by one octave. In Table
1, the results of comparisons with other main methods [2-3] are given. Other schemes
need a large training for each class of images. However, the proposed approach only
needs a sample of each class for training at 0 angle, then can work well. Nevertheless,
the proposed approach can deal with 111 classes with a correct classification rate of
more than 97%, only using scale=7 and 14 features.

4 Conclusions
A rotation invariant texture classification scheme based on the circular Gabor filter is
developed for a reasonably large (111 classes) texture databases. By the mean and
variance of the Gabor filtered image, a discriminant can be found to classify rotated
images. The primary experiments have proven that the proposed approach is effective
for rotation invariant texture classification.
