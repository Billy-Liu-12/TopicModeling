magnitude) of the individual steps is suggested by means of Hamiltonian
systematization multystep chemical reaction model. The given computation
method is desplayed on the Chapman analyse model for ozone kinetics,as well
as a tools of reduction model of formaldehyde oxidation reaction in the presence
of carbon (II) oxide.

1 Introduction
The key question for mathematical simulation of complex (multistep) chemical
reaction systems is to reveal the kinetic significance of steps and species in these
reactions. This is connected with the solution of the following important tasks.
• to reveal the chemical basis of the multistep reaction - the role of molecular
chemical conversion of species in the reaction system;
• to reduce the kinetic model of chemical reaction systems with revelation of the
basic mechanism;
• to find ways for oriented effecting on multistep chemical reactions and their
optimal control;
• to plan the experiment.
The objective of the present report is the development of a new universal method to
have the steps and the species included in the chemical reaction kinetic model be
numerically estimated.

The kinetic significance of reaction steps and species included in the reaction
mechanism was determined using the approach of value magnitudes we have
introduced before [1-3].
The value of G j step is determined as the relation of response by a chosen
characteristic magnitude of the reaction system, at any t moment of time, to
perturbation of j reaction step rate at the t0 moment of time:

G j (t ) =

v j = v j ( t0 )

j = 1, 2,..n,

(3)

F ( t ) is the dynamic parameter of integral behavior; this parameter

characterizes the chosen output value of reaction, e.g. the concentration of species, the
yield of purposeful products, the reaction retardation period, etc.
Analogous, the value of a reaction system species is determined as the relation of
output value

i = 1, 2,.., m

f i ( t ) = dci ( t ) dt is the rate of concentration change for an i -th component.
It follows from (3) and (4) that the value of a i -th step equals to the difference of

and

2.2 Account of Value Parameters
The approach of Hamiltonian systematization for dynamic systems was used to
calculate the value parameters.
Let the chosen property or the purpose functional be represented in an integral form:
t

I ( t ) = ∫ F ( t ) dt

For example, if it is aimed to reveal the role of reaction individual steps and species in
the dynamics of change in concentration of the i -th species or several species, then
the functionals, respectively, will be:
t

I i ( t ) = ci ( t ) = ∫ f i ( t ) dt
t0

Rewriting equation (4) in an integral form

and denoting

Proceeding from (13) for an arbitrary

(14)

Thus it follows from equations (10), (12) and (14) that H is the Hamiltonian of the
system. Values of components ψ i and then, in compliance with (5) and (6) the value
contributions of species and reaction steps are accounted by solving the system of
conjugated equations (14) jointly with the kinetic equation (12).It must be mentioned
that value magnitudes acquired by the present method are easy interpretable. In order
to explain it from the point of view of physical meaning, the equation (10) is to be
represented as
n

m

j =1

i =1

F = − H + ∑ h j = − H + ∑ bi
It follows from equation (15) that value contributions of

(15)

h j steps and those of the bi

species characterize their relative contribution into the chosen output parameter F for
a multystep reaction, with an accuracy up to a constant.
Initial values of

ψ i ( t0 )

required for the simulation of value parameters are

determined by (4).
Thus, the procedure of accounting the value parameters, which forms the basis of the
computer program VALKIN, is inferred to the following steps:
a) setting up a system of kinetic equations (1);
b) formal representation of the purpose functional for a multistep reaction (equation
(7)) and the respective Hamiltonian of the system (equation (10));
c)

setting up a system of differential equations for

Illustrative Examples

3.1

Ozone Kinetics

Chapman mechanism relating to the kinetics of atmosphere ozone conversion
presented in Table 1 has been used as an illustrative example. This choice is
conditioned by the fact that this example is assumed to be considered as a test model
for new methods; other different methods of model analysis, in particular the method
of sensitivity analysis were tested considering this example [4,6].
Mathematical program VALKIN that we have developed was used for numerical
computation of reaction species concentration time profiles as well as reaction steps
relative contributions. In this program the systems of differential equations are solved
by the program ROW-4A [7].
The initial concentrations expressed in terms of number of particles to centimeter in
cube, are the following:

[O ]0 = 106 , [O3 ]0 = 1012

and

[O2 ]0 = 3, 7 ⋅106 .

At the first step one has to set up a system of kinetic equations (1) in accordance with
the model represented in table 1.
For the revelation of stage contributions the purpose functional (8) is to be
represented as:
t

I ( t ) = [O3 ]t = ∫ f O3 dt

(16)

t0

Here

f O3 - is the rate of change in ozone concentration.

The respective Hamiltonian, in compliance with (10), will be reduced to the following
form
H = − fO3 + ψ O f O + ψ O3 f O3 + ψ O2 fO2
(17)
Then taking into account this form of Hamiltonian (17) a system of conjugated
equation ψ i (14) is to be set up.
The dynamics of

ψO, ψO , ψO

magnitudes was determined solving the system of

differential equations (1) and (14). In accordance with the purpose functional (16) the
initial values for ψ O , ψ O3 and ψ O2 equal respectively t0 : 0, 1, 0. Based on values
obtained for conjugate functions, according to equations (5) and (6), time
dependencies of reaction (see Table 1) contributions were computed.

The results from value approach sufficiently enough coincide with the ones obtained
by T. Hwang [4] by the analysis of ozone concentration sensitivity to variations of
step rate constants. Though in general, in case of more complex reaction mechanisms,
data from value approach could differ as well. This assertion is associated with the
fact that in the case of reaction system response to step rate variation the role of steps
is revealed to a more extent than when only the rate constant of that step is varied.

3.2 The Reduction of the Reaction Mechanism of Gas Phase Chain Reaction of
Phormaldehyde Oxidation in the Presence of Carbon (II) Oxide
The conscious choise of this object is conditianed by the fact that it turned out to be
very useful approbation of reaction kinetic models reduction methods based on the
method of sensitivity analysis [5,8,9].
Both the dominant and non-essential steps of reaction mechanism, shown in Table 3,
were defined in work [5], on the bases of the isolated massive of the given species
concentration sensitivity in accordance with the reaction step rate constant speech
510–3sec. for reaction time. Further, the use of a more systematic analyze method of
the given sensitivity of concentration and of the accumulation rate of the species to
the variations of step rate constant (the method of principal component analysis)
succeeded in ranging the roles of reaction mechanism individual step of
phormaldehyde oxidation in the presence of carbon(II) oxide. In these works the
minimal mechanism reaction consists of 13 steps, at the average with an accuracy up
to 2% giving the same results (the reaction time is 5± sec.) as the initial kinetic
model consisted of 25 steps (see Table 2).

Comments: The significance of the rate constant of the reaction is reduced to units:

Now, let the stages of value analysis of kinetic model of formaldehyde oxidation in
the presence of carbon (II) oxide be represented in a scheme. To begin with, let’s
single out the purpose functional characterizing the concentration change of the initial
things: - formaldehyde, carbon oxide (II) and oxygen

The system of the differential equation (12) and (13) is solved under the following
initial significances of ψ i . From the purpose functional (18) we have,
thatψ CH 2O ( 0 ) = ψ CO ( 0 ) = ψ O2
For other species

ψi

of the reaction during the initial moment of time the

significance is equal to zero. Table 3 shows the calculated value contributions of the
reaction steps, where the absolute significance is reduced gradually from 10–5 sec to
310-3 sec. (conversion CH2O 1.23%).

Table 3. The Comparison of the Step Numbers Being Arranged in the Reduction of
their Kinetic Significance, Acquired by Different Methods, as well the Base
(Minimal) Mechanism of the Reaction

Analyzing the findings from Table 3, it’s obvious that the value contribution of the
absolute magnitude the first 14 steps include the base mechanism of the reaction. The
relative contributions of the reaction, not being included in the reaction mechanism,
are only a few under the reaction time considered. It is worth mentioning that the
individual step (14), being out of the base mechanism [7,8] occupies only the 13th

608

place in the isolated range. The base mechanism , consisted of 14 steps , including the
step (14), describes the time profile of hydrogen atom concentration , which is
deflected from the calculation of the initial model by 4%, and the isolated base model
of the reaction in [7,8] consisted of 13 steps is deflected by 2,7%. However, for all
species and especially for oxygen atoms, during the reaction time (from 10–5 sec. to
310–3 sec.) this model is much less deflected from the calculation made by the use of
initial models (25 steps). To compare, we can pay attention on the fact, that in (17) the
first 16 steps of the analogous rate were taken into consideration for the isolated base
mechanism of the reaction. The individual step 8, being included in the base
mechanism, according to the calculation, has little significance and occupies the 16th
place in the range. Whereas, the step 14, being isolated as ponderable enough for the
reaction, isn’t included in the base mechanism.
Now let’s focus our attention on the role of the decrease order of the step. The
decrease order of kinetic significance of the reaction steps, isolated by value
methods, generally coincides with literature data, being defined by sensitivity analyze
method [5,8,9]. Some of the observed differences apparently are connected with the
difference of the value characteristics and parameters of sensitivity, which define the
kinetic significance of the step [1-3]. Here the essential role can take the very
circumstance, which by the value analysis of kinetic model reaction is distinctly
selected as an index of the reaction quality: a purpose functional on which wholly
depends the kinetic significance of the reaction step.
So, the examples of kinetic model of formaldehyde oxidation in the presence of
carbon (II) oxide makes it quite possible to be completely convinced that the value
analysis is a reliable mathematical tools of reduction mechanisms which reveals the
base kinetic model of chemical conversion.
Thus we have worked out a new numerical method and a relevant computer program
VALKIN for the analysis of chemical reaction models, which widen the scope of
means for specialists in the field of chemical kinetics and engineering.
