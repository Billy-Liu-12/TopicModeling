Abstract
Mitosis inside a tumour can be prohibited for diﬀerent reasons, such as overcrowding or physical pressure. At
the same time, the rate of successful mitoses inside a tumour can hardly be measured in vivo or vitro, but is easily
modeled in silico. In this paper we present a study of the inﬂuence of mitoses rate on the growth dynamics of a cellular
automata model for growth.

1. Introduction
According to medical reports, cancer is the second leading cause of death in developed countries [1]. An eﬀective
scheme of its treatment is a research objective for many scientists, but not only biologists and clinicians participate
in this process. Contemporary biological approaches and facilities are often not able to separate the underlying
mechanisms of tumour growth, and here statistics and mathematical modeling make their contribution [2].
A rich variety of tumour growth models appeared in the last two decades [3–12]. Many of them use cellular
automata [13–17] as a basic simulations vehicle, because these systems have proven their suitability and advantageous
usability in the ﬁeld of biomodeling [3].
In [18] we demonstrate the importance of taking natural tumour shrinkage due to necrosis of cells in the tumour
mass into account in the simulation and its inﬂuence on the growth regime. Earlier cellular automata based mesoscopic
models (which model a single biological cell by a single automaton cell) have not payed special attention to such
shrinkage. Some involve it implicitly (in [19], for example), but a distinct rate of shrinkage was not determined.
The fact is that mitosis inside the tumour can be prohibited due to overcrowding, physical pressure, incoming
intercellular signals or other reasons. A cell, which is situated deep inside the tumour, has less chance to divide
successfully than one on the periphery of the tumour [20]. The rate of successful mitoses can hardly be observed
and measured in vivo or in vitro. At the same time it can be easily simulated in silico. Our objective is to study the
dependency of growth dynamics on this parameter.
We assume that the mitosis rate is uniformly distributed over the inner cells of the proliferating tumour layer.
In vivo or in vitro this is diﬀerent and there is a dependency between a chance to divide and the depth of the cell

disposition. While the exact character of this dependency is questionable, we decide to assume that the successful
mitosis rate is the same for all cells inside the tumour. This assumption is not critical, accounting that a proliferating
rim is usually several cells thick [21, 22].
In [18] the rate of successful mitoses is just given a certain value. Here, using the same experimental setup we
will vary the rate and validate the results against in vitro growth of the LoVo cells spheroid [23], trying to make
conclusions concerning the realism of distinct successful mitosis rates.
For the general avascular tumour simulation we will use one of the four variants of models, presented in [18],
where natural tumour shrinkage was neglected and where chain shifting along straight lines was used for the expansion
simulation [5, 7–10, 20, 24–26]. When a cell divides, it pushes one of its neighbours to free a place for its daughter
cell. So, cells are pushed outwards one by one along a certain trajectory, starting from one of the mother cell’s
neighbours. In most cases this trajectory represents a straight line [7–10] or a random zigzag [27].
The scientiﬁc community has produced signiﬁcant results and software [28, 29] for cellular automata based simulations. Our model was created with the help of the CAME& L software environment [29, 30].
2. Tumour Growth Model
The model is implemented with a three dimensional cellular automaton with Cartesian metrics and Moore’s neighbourhood [31]. The timestep is equal to one hour. Each automaton’s cell represents a single biological cell, with size
10μm×10μm×10μm. Mersenne twister [32] was used for random numbers generation.
We assume that the metabolism requires one nutrient, which is diﬀusing from the healthy area into the clot of
malignant cells. As a result, normal cells act as nutrition sources for the cancerous tissue. Diﬀusion is computed
using a standard ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization of the diﬀusion equation.
We also assume homogeneous pressure, and neglect obstacles such as, for example, bones. So, the tumour expansion process in the model is organized as virtual “turning” of a normal cells into a malignant state.
The state data of the cellular automaton cell is divided into two parts: the ﬁrst one describes a contained biological
cell, whereas the second one characterizes an occupied area of tissue. The key diﬀerence between these two subsets is
that elements of the ﬁrst should “follow” the cell, when moves due to chain shifting. At the same time, the elements
of the second one should not. The list bellow enumerates the ﬁelds from the ﬁrst part.
1. State – Biological state of a cell. State N corresponds to a normal tissue cell. Values T M , TG1 , T S , TG2 designate
diﬀerent phases of a proliferating malignant cell’s cycle, TG0 denote a quiescent malignant cell. A cell in state
D represents the remains of a dead cell.
2. InState – The amount of timesteps, which a cell has spent in its current biological state. This value matters for
proliferating and quiescent malignant cells only.
3. PhaseDuration – The amount of timesteps, which a current cell’s phase has to last. This value also matters for
proliferating and quiescent malignant cells only. This value should be calculated at the moment of the cell’s
transition to a new phase, according to known statistical data [33].
For the current version of the model, the set of ﬁelds, which describes the area of tissue occupied by a cell, consists
of a single element: NutrientConcentration – local concentration of the nutrient.
The tumour growth simulation process is usually based on the assumption that the process starts from a single
malignant cell [21], situated in the center of a grid. So, initially all cells of the grid contain normal biological cells,
except the center one, which holds a malignant cell ready for mitosis (in T M state).
A special list ChainShiftOut is used to store the coordinates of all the cells, which underwent mitosis on the current
timestep. For each timestep the accumulating starts from scratch.
The rules, which govern the cellular automaton, can be separated into three logical elements: a prestep, an application of the transitions function (the step) and a poststep. The prestep contains the following operations:
• Increase the value of the InState ﬁeld for all proliferating and quiescent malignant cells.
• Decrease the amount of available nutrients in the correspondence with the consumption rates for all proliferating
and quiescent malignant cells.

• Clear ChainShiftOut list.
Below is a list of the transition conditions. They are arranged in order of execution. Note that if a cell’s state was
changed then the value of its InState ﬁeld should be reset to zero.
1. T M → TG1 (Mitosis) – If a cell is ready for mitosis, then its position inside the tumour should be checked.
If there is a normal cell in its neighbourhood then the cell is considered to belong to tumour surface and its
mitosis cannot fail. For inner cells mitosis can be successful with a given probability, which we will refer to
as the successful mitoses rate. In case of the successful division the only thing to be done is to put the mother
cell’s coordinates in the ChainShiftOut list. The mother cell itself, being in the mitotic state, just continues to
proliferate and enters the gap-1 phase [34].
2. TG1 → TG1 ; T S → T S ; TG2 → TG2 (Proliferation) – A cell stays in the current phase if its InState value is less
than its PhaseDuration value [7–10, 34].
3. TG1 → T S ; T S → TG2 ; TG2 → T M (Proliferation) – A cell changes the phase if its InState value reaches its
PhaseDuration value [7–10, 34].
4. TG1 → TG0 (Getting quiescent) – A cell gets quiescent if the local level of the nutrient is below the per hour
proliferating cell nutrient consumption rate [12].
5. TG0 → T S (Returning from quiescence) – A cell returns from the quiescence to the proliferation if the local
level of the nutrient is above the per hour proliferating cell nutrient consumption rate [12].
6. TG0 → D (Necrosis) – A cell dies if the supply of the nutrient have not appeared during the maximal quiescence
time length [34].
7. N → N (Rest) – Normal cell is not changing its state by itself.
8. TG0 → TG0 (Quiescence) – Quiescent cell is not changing its state unless it returns to proliferation or dies [7–
10, 12, 34].
9. D → D (Rest) – Dead cell is not changing its state by itself. This only can be caused by chain shifts.
The poststep consists in following operations:
• Diﬀuse the nutrient. Diﬀusion is much faster than the time step used to model the cell cycle. Therefore, at each
time step we compute a steady state ﬁeld of concentration of the nutrient.
• For each element of the ChainShiftOut list (which represents coordinates of a divided cell) perform the chain
shift in random direction along a straight line and place a newborn cell in the TG1 phase to the disengaged cell
(the ﬁrst cell of the chain), which will be a mother cell’s neighbour. Such kind of chain shift will deﬁnitely
result in a fussy boundary of the formed clot. That is why it was decided to make one more operation: move
the outermost malignant cell of the trajectory (the last cell of the chain) to one of its vacant neighbours, if the
neighbour is closer to the geometrical center of the tumour. This imitates the pressure between the healthy
tissue and the cancerous formation.
We will perform a number of experiments, varying the successful mitoses rate. Other parameters used for the
simulations, the results and their agreement with the reality are presented in Sect. 3.
3. Experiments
3.1. Gompertz Law Based Validation
The kinetic behaviour of a tumour growth process can be reproduced by the Gompertz law [23, 35–38] which is
widely used for these purposes. The law can be written in the following form:
a
(1 − exp(−b t)) ,
(1)
b
where V(t) is the tumour volume in time; V0 – the initial volume; a – the initial instantaneous tumour growth rate;
b – the growth retardation factor.
V(t) = V0 exp

L. Naumov et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2010) 1–8

Knowing V0 it is possible to describe the growth regime with two values: a and b. The validation procedure
consists in the comparison of these two parameters for the in silico data with the same values known for real in vitro
or in vivo specimen.
At the same time, value of a/b ratio is also informative, regardless the exact values of a and b. It describes the
growth pattern of the tumour: a larger ratio means that the growth is closer to the exponential one, while a smaller
ratio points to more linear character of growth.
Demicheli et al. [23] report the following values for the in vitro growth of the mice LoVo cells spheroids:
a = 0.04 ± 0.01 h−1 ,
b = 0.0022 ± 0.0007 h−1 .

(2)

a = (7 ± 1) b + (0.023 ± 0.002).

(3)

Moreover, they postulate a strong linear correlation between both parameters:

3.2. Experimental Setup
The set of model parameters reproduces the one used in [18] and corresponds to an in vitro tumour composed of
LoVo cells. In Table 1 the parameters are presented with their values, which were used for the experiments.
These parameters were obtained from literature, which discuss in vivo or in vitro tumour growth experiments. We
have studied the sensitivity of the model versus most of them varying their values by 1%. Model demonstrated its
robustness.
3.3. Validation and Discussion
We have performed ﬁve experiments for each of following successful mitoses rates: 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,
55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 100% (despite the last value not being realistic). The step is
shortened between 50% and 90%, because, as we will demonstrate, this region represents the major interest. A grid
of 201 × 201 × 201 cells was used.
We measured the time (in cellular automaton steps) needed for the tumour to reach a 201 × 201 × 201 cells size as
a function of the successful mitoses rates. The results, averaged over the ﬁve experiments, are shown in Fig. 1.
For each experiment we ﬁt the resulting growth curve versus the Gompertz law and retrieve a and b parameters.
The maximal, minimal, and average values of a and b for a given successful mitoses rate are presented in Fig. 2.
Starting with a successful mitoses rate of 20%, both Gompertzian growth parameters fall into the range of values as
observed in vitro (see Eq. 2). At the same time, only starting from 60% almost all pairs of these parameters satisfy the
linear correlation, given by Eq. 3. Only 2 of 40 experiments produce a and b values, which do not comply with it. At
the same time, for a successful mitoses rate of 55% and below no single set of parameters pairs is in agreement with
the linear correlation.
Having no ability to measure such microscopic parameter as the successful mitoses rate in real biological system,
we can draw some conclusions about its magnitude, based on the simulation presented here and in vitro experiments
of larger scale [23]. Our results suggest that at least 55% of inner proliferating tumour LoVo cells are dividing (see
Fig. 3).
The global trends for a and b as function of the successful mitoses rate are as follows: a is growing, b is descending
regardless the ﬂuctuations. At the same time, both parameters are tightly interdependent. This is illustrated by the

fact that their spreads (relative magnitude of diﬀerence between minimal and maximal values) and relative positions
of the average values look similar for any given successful mitoses rate. Their interdependency results in the fact that
the average a/b ratio is monotonously growing as one may see in Fig. 3. This conforms with the expectations that the
growth should obtain more exponential character if the proportion of mitotic cells inside a tumour is increasing.
In [18] we use a value of the successful mitoses rate, which was computed during the simulations as a rate of the
successful random walks from an inner malignant cell outside. A length of the walking trajectory was limited by a
squared distance from the cell to the geometrical center of the tumour. Note, that the artiﬁcially computed result was
70% and this value belongs to the range of possible rates, according to the described research.
