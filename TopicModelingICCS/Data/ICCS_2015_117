Abstract
In this work, the experimenting fields approach is applied to the numerical solution of the NavierStokes equation for incompressible viscous flow. In this work, the solution is sought for both the
pressure and velocity fields in the same time. Apparently, the correct velocity and pressure fields
satisfy the governing equations and the boundary conditions. In this technique a set of predefined
fields are introduced to the governing equations and the residues are calculated. The flow according to
these fields will not satisfy the governing equations and the boundary conditions. However, the
residues are used to construct the matrix of coefficients. Although, in this setup it seems trivial
constructing the global matrix of coefficients, in other setups it can be quite involved. This technique
separates the solver routine from the physics routines and therefore makes easy the coding and
debugging procedures. We compare with few examples that demonstrate the capability of this
technique.
Keywords: Navier-Stokes equations, the continuum hypothesis, numerical methods, experimenting field approach.

1 Introduction
The fascinating patterns of fluid motion at the macroscopic scale hinder different reality at the
microscopic scale characterised by complete randomness and chaoticity. It also reveals that these
orderly macroscopic motions may be described by a set of laws that are, in principle, physically
consistent. This point of view conforms to our perception of fluids as continua in which the medium is
continuous to any level of spatial resolution one might hope to reach. Apart from the fact that the
concept of continuum is a mathematical abstraction to idealize the treatment of phenomena that are
otherwise complex, it was able to provide us with sufficient tools that successfully describe many of
the underlying macroscopic fluids fascination. In this sense, macroscopic field variables are

continuous functions of space and time and make readily available the arsenal of mathematical tools
related to theories of continuous functions. A number of consequences, however, appear as a result of
adapting the continuum hypothesis. The first is that new variables at the macroscopic description
emerge that does not have counterparts at the microscopic scale (e.g., pressure, temperature, density,
etc.). Even variables which have counterparts (e.g., velocity, acceleration, etc.) are now having
different meanings. That is while the velocity at the microscopic scale is associated with a definite
particle, it is at the macroscopic scale not associated with particles; rather it represents an average over
representative volume of the velocity of the many particles contained within this volume. The
averaging process generates, in addition to the averaged quantities, other quantities which are related
to micro-scale variables and this makes the governing equations unclosed. This necessitates that two
different mechanisms be hypothesized for the transport of conservative quantities, Leal [1]. The first is
associated with the continuum motion and the second is related to the microscopic random motion of
fluid particles projected over the continuum variables. For the transport of energy or solute the later
mechanism describes what is known as the diffusion process and for momentum, it is more
complicated, and generally describes surface stresses. Surface stresses are related to the transport of
momentum by random motion of the particles across the direction of the bulk motion of the
continuum. The notion of stress vector (force exerted on area) is introduced by Cauchy who
hypothesized that this stress vector changes with the change of orientation of the areal element. That is
stress vectors depend, in addition to the position and the time, on the orientation of the surface and is
therefore a tensor quantity. Since these quantities depends on molecular exchange across area, it is
important to relate them to macroscopic variables through constitutive relationships. Such constitutive
relationships relate the net microscopic fluxes to the gradient of macroscopic variables through
parameters that are dependent on the fluid (e.g., thermal conductivity, solute diffusion coefficient,
viscosity, etc.). The governing equations describing conservation laws in isothermal fluid continua are
those related to the conservation of mass and momentum. The derivation of such laws necessitates
introducing the concept of control volume which is a mathematical abstraction employed in order to
facilitate the derivation of the governing laws, Fig. 1. It is a volume fixed in space or moving with
definite velocity through which fluid flows. The surface enclosing the control volume is referred to as
the control surface. For a given control volume, the conservation equations may be presented as

The solution of this set of equations is obtained, usually, numerically for which there exist a
number of schemes as will be explained in the next section.

2 On the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations
The above mentioned set of equations describes both laminar and turbulent flow scenarios.
However, when the flow is turbulent, the numerical solution of these equations requires a very dense
mesh to resolve all the length and time scales typically associated with turbulent flow regimes which
pose real challenges when modelling real flow problems. The difficulties associated with the
numerical solution of the governing equations stems from the highly non-linear features of the NavierStokes equations when the flow conditions are turbulent. There is a great deal of motivation, therefore,
to simplify the governing equations by time averaging and model the obtained turbulence stresses. The
numerical solution of the NS equations is sometimes refers to as computational fluid dynamics, CFD,
which has been the subject of intensive research. The number of literatures available that covers all
aspects and techniques are enormous to be presented in this work. Several textbooks are available
which cover a wide range of methods and algorithms including the finite differences method, the finite
elements methods and their variants, finite volumes method and others [2-6]. The numerical solution
of the governing equations involve spatial and temporal (in case of time-dependent problems)
discretization. The simplest explicit forward step for incompressible NS equations may take the form

The solution of this system requires a pair of compatible pressure and velocity spaces to solve the
system resulting in the discrete system to be coupled. In other words, a global linear system may be
constructed of the form

where the vector v contains all the velocity components and p is the pressure vector. Mixed finite
element (MFE) is an example of the methods which works with different basis functions for both the
velocity and the pressure. In the realm of NS algorithms using MFE, it is customary to use quadratic
piece-wise polynomials for the velocity and linear piecewise polynomial for the pressure. MFE
applied to the numerical solution of the NS produces a linear system as given in (16). Moreover, finite
difference schemes working on staggered grid, Fig. 2, can also lead to similar system as given in (16).
As outlined in Langtangen et al. [7], this system, in some cases, can be singular and requires special
discretization or stabilizing techniques to ensure invertible matrix. The singularity of such system can
be circumvented by introducing a stabilization matrix, ߝࡰǡ and a perturbation of the right hand side,

The parameter ߝ is usually taken as constant, however, for some more involved problems including
anisotropic mesh, it can be local (i.e., dependent on the location). Such stabilizing matrices are
constructed based on some heuristic approaches or by some physical assumptions. They are all based
on adding a pressure term to the continuity equation. A number of such possibilities include

Eq. 19 above has some relevance to the problem of flow of compressible fluids. For compressible
flow, the NS equations take the form:

where λ is the second coefficient of viscosity (bulk viscosity). If we consider fluid with little
compressibility, then it may be possible to neglect the bulk viscosity. Under such condition, a
linearized equation of state for isothermal fluid relates the pressure and density such that:

Let ͳȀߝ ൌ ܿ଴ଶ ߩ଴ , and manipulating the above equation one obtains Eq. 19. The application of the
pseudo-compressibility transient term converts the elliptic system of incompressible flow equations
into a set of hyperbolic type equations. Ideally the value of the pseudo compressibility is to be chosen
such that the speed of propagation of disturbances approaches that of the incompressible flow. On the
other hand if the pseudo-compressibility parameter is chosen such that the speed of disturbance
propagation is too slow, the variation of the pressure field accompanying these waves will, likewise,
be slow.

3 The experimenting field approach
The numerical solution of this equation is based on the experimenting fields approach. In this
approach a set of experimenting fields are applied to the governing equations as will be detailed later
in this section. This technique has been developed and applied to several transport phenomena in
porous media and show to be efficient and robust [8-14]. In this work we extend it to a more general
framework. The governing equations based on pseudo compressibility may be written as:

With some discretization in space, a linear system may be constructed. For this purpose and
without loss of generality, we consider the cell-centered finite differences approximation of the
governing equations. We define a simple 2D problem in a rectangular domain, Ω: (a1,b1)×(a2,b2),
filled with a single fluid. The approximation is thought over the rectangular mesh defined by

Apparently, if the velocity and pressure fields are the correct fields satisfying the governing
equations and the boundary condition, the global system satisfy the equality as given in Eq. 22. If,
however, the velocity and pressure fields are not the correct fields, Eq. 22 is not satisfied. Moreover,
since the system is linear, a correct subfield (i.e., u, v or p) would satisfy their own system but not the
global one. In other words, if u is the correct velocity field in the x-direction, Eq. 28 is satisfied but not
the global system given in Eq. 22. We use this property to examine the behavior of the different
systems to specific kinds of fields and how the different matrices composing the global system are
constructed. As an example, consider how the matrix ‫ܣ‬௫௫ is evaluated. The system given by Eq. 41
may be written as:

If the entries of the matrix ‫ܣ‬௫௫ are known, then, as mentioned earlier, the only x-velocity field that
satisfies the equality is the correct field which satisfies the global system and the boundary conditions.
Any other field will not satisfy the equality. However, consider applying a particular velocity field in
the x-direction which is one at one location (i.e., at one edge) and zero elsewhere as shown in Fig.3-a.
If this field is applied to system 44, the column of the matrix of coefficients corresponding to the
location of the x-velocity which is one can be obtained. As shown in system 44, the first column is
determined given this particular velocity field.

Figure 4 shows a schematic of the matrices constructing technique. This relationship implies that
one needs to solve local problems for every single cell or edge which is apparently easier and at the
background constructing the global matrix of coefficients and then solving the global system. There is,
however, the disadvantage that one is required to solving large number of local problem in order to
construct the matrix of coefficients. However, based on our understanding of the local stencil, it is
possible to significantly reduce the number of local problems. For example, for first order
approximation of the velocity and pressure derivatives, only nine times that such local problems may
be solved if one takes the experimenting fields which do not overlap stencils of the local problems,
Fig. 3-b. When the experimenting pressure field is all zeros, the residue calculates the contribution of
the boundary conditions.

4 Numerical Examples: Lid driven cavity
In order to investigate the effect of the value of pseudo compressibility parameter on the steady
state solution of the NS equations, a bench mark problem, namely the Lid driven flow problem, has
been investigated. In this set up a square domain is considered filled with porous medium saturated
with a single fluid. The domain boundaries are impermeable and the top boundary moves at a
tangential speed u0 as shown in Fig.5. The results are compared with the benchmark problem of Ghia
[14] and very good match is obtained as shown in Figs. 6-9.

5 Conclusion
In this work we introduce the use of the experimenting fields approach to the numerical solution of
the Navier-Stokes equations. In this approach a number of predefined experimenting fields are
operated on the discretized equations to construct automatically the global system. A number of local
problems equal to the number of unknown variables are solved to generate such coefficients.
However, such number of local problems can be significantly reduced to only 9 fields (in 2D) and
therefore significantly reduce CPU time. We compare the results obtained by this technique and those
found in literatures and very good match is obtained.
