Abstract. An important tool in the management of photochemical smog episodes is
a computational model which can be used to test the eﬀect of possible emission control
strategies. High spatial resolution of such a model is important to reduce the impact
of numerical errors on predictions and to allow better comparison of the model with
experimental data during validation. This paper therefore presents the development
of an adaptive grid model for the Central European Region describing the formation
of photochemical oxidants based on unstructured grids. Using adaptive methods, grid
resolutions of less than 20 km can be achieved in a computationally eﬀective way.
Initial simulation of the photochemical episode of August 1998 indicates that the model
captures the spatial and temporal tendencies of ozone production and demonstrates
the eﬀectiveness of adaptive methods for achieving high resolution model predictions.

Introduction

Previous EUROTRAC investigations have shown that some of the highest regional ozone concentrations in Europe can be observed in Central Europe, including
Hungary. During summer ozone episodes, the ozone burden of natural and agricultural vegetation is often well beyond tolerable levels. Budapest is one of the
biggest cities in this region, emitting signiﬁcant amounts of ozone precursor substances. An important tool in the management of photochemical smog episodes
is a computational model which can be used to test the eﬀect of possible emission
control strategies. High spatial resolution of such a model is important to reduce
the impact of numerical errors on predictions and to allow better comparison of
the model with experimental data during validation. The review paper of Peters et al.[1] highlights the importance of developing more eﬃcient grid systems
for the next generation of air pollution models in order to “capture important
smaller scale atmospheric phenomena”. This paper therefore presents the development of an adaptive grid model for the Central European Region describing

the formation of photochemical oxidants based on unstructured grids. The initial
base grid of the model uses a nested approach with a coarse grid covering the
wider central European region and a ﬁner resolution grid over Hungary. Further
reﬁnement or de-reﬁnement is then invoked using indicators based on the comparison of high and low order numerical solution of the atmospheric diﬀusion
equation. Using this method, grid resolutions of less than 20 km can be achieved
in a computationally eﬀective way.

Model Description

The model describes the spread of reactive air pollutants within a 2D unstructured triangular based grid representing layers within the troposphere over the
Central European region including Hungary. The model describes the horizontal
domain using a Cartesian coordinate system through the stereographic polar
projection of a curved surface onto a ﬂat plane. The total horizontal domain size
is 1540 km × 1500 km. Vertical resolution of pollutants is approximated by the
application of four layers representing the surface, mixing, reservoir layers and
the free troposphere. Reactive dispersion in the horizontal domain is described
by the atmospheric diﬀusion equation in two space dimensions:

where cs is the concentration of the s’th compound, u,w, are horizontal wind
velocities, Kx and Ky are eddy diﬀusivity coeﬃcients and κ1s and κ2s are dry and
wet deposition velocities respectively. Es describes the distribution of emission
sources for the s’th compound and Rs is the chemical reaction term which may
contain nonlinear terms in cs . For n chemical species an n-dimensional set of
partial diﬀerential equations (p.d.e.s) is formed describing the rates of change
of species concentration over time and space, where each is coupled through the
nonlinear chemical reaction terms.
The four vertical layers of the model are deﬁned as; the surface layer extending
to 50m, the mixing layer, a reservoir layer and the free troposphere (upper) layer.
The mixing layer extends to a height determined by radiosonde data at 12am,
but is modelled to rise smoothly to a height determined by radiosonde data at
12pm during the day[2]. The reservoir layer, if it exists above the height of the
mixing layer, extends from the top of the mixing layer to an altitude of 1000
m. Vertical mixing and deposition are parameterised according to the vertical
stratiﬁcation presented by VanLoon[3]. Deposition velocities are assumed to be
constant across the whole domain. The eddy diﬀusivity coeﬃcients for the x and
y directions were set to 50 m2 s−1 for all species.
Relative humidity and temperature data were determined by the meteorological model ALADIN with a time resolution of 6 hours and spatial resolution of
0.1 × 0.15 degrees[4]. The local wind speed and direction were obtained from the

The Simulation of Photochemical Smog Episodes in Hungary

ECMWF database ensuring conservation properties of the original data[5]. The
ECMWF data has a time resolution of 6 hours and a spatial resolution of 2.5
× 2.5 degrees. These data were interpolated to obtain data relevant to a given
space and time point on the unstructured grid using conservative methods as
described in Ghorai et al.[6].
The emission of precursor species into the domain was described by the
EMEP emissions inventory for 1997 based on a 50km × 50km grid[7]. The emissions data have to be interpolated onto the unstructured mesh following each
change to the mesh during reﬁnement. This is achieved using the mass conservative method of overlapping triangles. The EMEP data is therefore split into
triangular grid cells and the proportion of each EMEP triangle that overlaps each
mesh triangle calculated. Point sources, although not included in the current simulations, can be included in the model by averaging them into the appropriate
triangle. It follows that as the mesh resolution is improved, the description of
point source emissions will also improve. During the initial simulations as described here the GRS chemical scheme was used[8] to enable fast turn around
times. Photolysis rate constants have been chosen to be in agreement with those
used by Derwent and Jenkin [9] and are expressed as m’th order rate constants
with units (molecule cm−3 )1−m s−1 . The photolysis rates were parameterised by
the function Jq =aq exp(-bq sec θ), where θ is the solar zenith angle and q is the
reaction number. The solar zenith angle is calculated from:
cos θ = cos(lha) cos(dec) cos(lat) + sin(dec) sin(lat),
where lha is the local hour angle (i.e. a function of the time of day), dec is
the solar declination (i.e. a function of the time of year) and lat is the latitude.
Temperature dependent rate constants are represented by standard Arrhenius
expressions.

Solution Method

The basis of the numerical method is the space discretisation of the p.d.e.s derived from the atmospheric diﬀusion equation on unstructured triangular meshes
using the software SPRINT2D[10,11,12]. This approach, (known as the ”Method
of Lines”), reduces the set of p.d.e.s in three independent variables to a system of
ordinary diﬀerential equations (o.d.e.s) in one independent variable, time. The
system of o.d.e.s can then be solved as an initial value problem, and a variety
of powerful software tools exist for this purpose[13]. For advection dominated
problems it is important to choose a discretisation scheme which preserves the
physical range of the solution. A more in-depth discussion of the methods can
be found in previous references[14,10,11,12].
3.1

Spatial Discretisation and Time Integration

Unstructured triangular meshes are commonly used in ﬁnite volume/element
applications because of their ability to deal with general geometries. In terms of

70

I. Lagzi et al.

application to multi-scale atmospheric problems, we are not dealing with complex physical geometries, but unstructured meshes provide a good method of
resolving the complex structures formed by the interaction of chemistry and
ﬂow in the atmosphere and by the varying types of emission sources. The term
unstructured represents the fact that each node in the mesh may be surrounded
by any number of triangles whereas in a structured mesh this number would be
ﬁxed. In the present work, a ﬂux limited, cell-centered, ﬁnite volume discretization scheme of Berzins and Ware[10,11] was chosen on an unstructured triangular
mesh. This method enables accurate solutions to be determined for both smooth
and discontinuous ﬂows by making use of the local Riemann solver ﬂux techniques (originally developed for the Euler equations) for the advective parts of
the ﬂuxes, and centered schemes for the diﬀusive part. The scheme used for the
treatment of the advective terms is an extension to irregular triangular meshes of
the nonlinear scheme described by Spekreijse[15] for regular Cartesian meshes.
The scheme of Berzins and Ware has the desirable properties, see Chock[16], of
preserving positivity eliminating spurious oscillations and restricting the amount
of diﬀusion by the use of a nonlinear limiter function. The advection scheme has
been shown to be of second order accuracy[11,17]. For details of the application
of the method to the atmospheric diﬀusion equation in two-space dimensions see
Tomlin et al.[12]. The diﬀusion terms are discretised by using a ﬁnite volume
approach to reduce the integrals of second derivatives to the evaluation of ﬁrst
derivatives at the midpoints of edges. These ﬁrst derivatives are then evaluated
by diﬀerentiating a bilinear interpolant based on four mid-point values[10]. The
boundary conditions are implemented by including them in the deﬁnitions of the
advective and diﬀusive ﬂuxes at the boundary.
A method of lines approach with the above spatial discretization scheme
results in a system of o.d.e.s in time which are integrated using the code
SPRINT[13] with the Theta option which is specially designed for the solution of stiﬀ systems with moderate accuracy and automatic control of the local
error in time. Operator splitting is carried out at the level of the nonlinear equations formed from the method of lines by approximating the Jacobian matrix,
and the method is described fully in Tomlin et al.[12]. The approach introduces
a second-order splitting error but fortunately this error only alters the rate of
convergence of the iteration as the residual being reduced is still that of the full
o.d.e. system. This provides signiﬁcant advantages over other splitting routines
such as Strang splitting.
3.2

Mesh Generation and Adaptivity

The initial unstructured meshes used in SPRINT2D are created from a geometry description using the Geompack mesh generator[18]. These meshes are
then reﬁned and coarsened by the Triad adaptivity module which uses tree like
data structures to enable eﬃcient mesh adaptation by providing the necessary
connectivity. A method of reﬁnement based on the regular subdivision of triangles has been chosen. Here an original triangle is split into four similar triangles by connecting the midpoints of the edges as shown in Fig. 1. These may

later be coalesced into the parent triangle when coarsening the mesh. This process is called local h-reﬁnement, since the nodes of the original mesh do not move
and we are simply subdividing the original elements. In order to implement the
Coarse

Refined

Fig. 1. Method of local reﬁnement based on the subdivision of triangles

adaptivity module a suitable criterion must be chosen. The ideal situation would
be that the decision to reﬁne or dereﬁne would be made on a fully automatic
basis with no user input necessary. In practice a combination of an automatic technique and some knowledge of the physical properties of the system is
used. The technique used in this work is based on the calculation of spatial error estimates. Low and high order solutions are obtained for each species and
the diﬀerence between them gives a measure of the spatial error. The algorithm
can then choose to reﬁne in regions of high spatial error by comparison with a
user deﬁned tolerance for one or the sum of several species. For the ith p.d.e.
component on the jth triangle, a local error estimate ei,j (t) is calculated from
the diﬀerence between the solution using a ﬁrst order method and that using a
second order method. For time dependent p.d.e.s this estimate shows how the
spatial error grows locally over a time step. A reﬁnement indicator for the jth
triangle is deﬁned by an average scaled error (serrj ) measurement over all npde
p.d.e.s using supplied absolute and relative tolerances:
serrj =

npde
�
i=1

ei,j (t)
,
atoli /Aj + rtoli × Ci,j

(2)

where atol and rtol are the absolute and relative error tolerances and Ci,j the
computed concentration of species i in triangle j. This formulation for the scaled
error provides a ﬂexible way to weight the reﬁnement towards any p.d.e. error.
In these calculations a combination of errors in species NO and NO2 were used
as reﬁnement indicators.
An integer reﬁnement level indicator is calculated from this scaled error to
give the number of times the triangle should be reﬁned or dereﬁned. Since the
error estimate is applied at the end of a time-step it is too late to make the
reﬁnement decision. Methods are therefore used for the prediction of the growth

72

I. Lagzi et al.

of the spatial error using linear or quadratic interpolants. The decision about
whether to reﬁne a triangle is based on these predictions, and the estimate made
at the end of the time- step can be used to predict errors at future time-steps.
Generally it is found that large spatial errors coincide with regions of steep
spatial gradients. The spatial error estimate can also be used to indicate when
the solution is being solved too accurately and can indicate which regions can
be coarsened. The tree data structure can then be used to restore a lower level
mesh which maintains the triangle quality. In order to minimise the overhead
involved in calculating the spatial error and interpolating the input data and
concentrations onto the new mesh, reﬁnement indicators are not calculated at
each time point but at intermediate points each 20 minutes of simulation time.
The errors induced are small in comparison with the computational savings
made[19]. If point sources are used it is also important to set a maximum level
of reﬁnement in order to prevent the code from adapting to too high a level
in regions with concentrated emissions where high spatial gradients may persist
down to very high levels of reﬁnement.

Simulation of Photochemical Smog Episode

The model was tested via the simulation of a photochemical oxidant episode
that took place in Hungary in August, 1998. During almost the whole month
wind speeds were low limiting dispersion, and strong sunshine resulted in high
photo-oxidant levels over most of Europe. The simulation period was from midnight 1 August 1998 to midnight 5th August 1998. Both ﬁxed and adaptive
mesh simulations were carried out in order to investigate the inﬂuence of mesh
resolution on predicted concentrations. The coarse level 0 grid covered Central
Europe as seen in Fig. 2 and is deﬁned by a maximum edge length of 228 km. For

comparison, simulations where also carried out using a level 2 reﬁned base grid
as shown in Fig. 2 with a maximum edge length of 56km. For both simulations
extra mesh reﬁnement to 3 levels (edge length 28km) was carried out around the
K-puszta monitoring station of the Hungarian Meteorological Service, located 70
km south-southeast from Budapest, in order to carry out comparisons of measured and simulated ozone concentrations. The initial conditions for the most
important species were as a follows: 1.9 ppb for NO2 , 3 ppb for NO, ppb 20.3 O3 ,
4 ppb for VOC and were constant across the domain. A certain amount of spin
up time was therefore required for the model in order to eliminate the impact
of the initial conditions. Fig. 3 shows the simulated ozone concentrations after
4 days of simulation on 5th August, 1998 at 15.00 for the two base grids where
no transient reﬁnement has taken place. The impact of mesh resolution can be
seen and the higher resolution simulation predicts higher peak concentrations
over the region South of Hungary.

An adaptive simulation was also carried out where transient reﬁnement was
limited to 4 levels below the base mesh, in this case leading to a minimum edge
length of approximately 20 km. Fig. 4 shows the grid at 18.00 on the third simulation day where reﬁnement has eﬀectively taken place around regions of high
gradients in NO and NO2 concentrations. The reﬁnement region is seen to cover
a large part of Hungary and the surrounding region where steep concentration
gradients occur. The simulated ozone concentrations for a level 2 base mesh and
the level 4 adaptive mesh shown in Fig. 4 at the simulated time of 18.00 on 5th
August, 1998 are shown in Fig. 5. The high ozone concentration area is found to
be in the Western region of Hungary where the grid is also dense for the adaptive
solution, and to Southwest of Hungary. There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
predicted peak ozone concentrations for the base mesh and the adaptive simu-

90ppb in the South West region of the mesh for the adaptive solution.

Fig. 6 shows the simulated and measured ozone concentrations at the Kpuszta station as a function of time during the simulation. As expected the
initial comparisons are poor during the model spin up period reﬂecting the need
for more accurate initial conditions. During the latter part of the simulation
the simulated ozone levels increase but are still considerably lower than the
ozone levels measured at K-puszta. There are several possible reasons for this.
The meteorological data used for the simulations was quite coarse and therefore
the region of predicted high ozone levels may be spatially inaccurate as a result.
High ozone concentrations are predicted in the Southwest region of the mesh but
lower concentrations in the area of K-puszta. It is also clear that the assumption

The Simulation of Photochemical Smog Episodes in Hungary

75

of constant initial conditions across the mesh is not accurate and aﬀects the
early part of the simulation. The amount of ozone generated over the 5 days
is quite well represented by the model, again leading to the requirement for
better initial conditions. The emissions data is also based on a fairly coarse grid.
Future improvements to the model will therefore be to include higher spatial
resolution meteorological data and emissions data for the Budapest region. The
incorporation of measured concentrations for initial conditions where possible
would also improve the simulations.

Conclusions

An adaptive grid model describing the formation and transformation of photochemical oxidants based on triangular unstructured grids has been developed
for the Central European Region, which includes Hungary. The model automatically places a ﬁner resolution grid in regions characterised by high concentration
gradients and therefore by higher numerical error. Using an adaptive method it
is therefore possible to achieve grid resolutions of the order of 20 km without
excessive computational eﬀort. Initial simulations of the photochemical episode
of August 1998 indicate that the model under predicts ozone concentrations,
but captures the spatial and temporal tendencies. The comparison of level 0 and
level 2 base mesh simulations with a level 4 adaptive simulation demonstrates
the impact of mesh reﬁnement on predicted ozone concentrations and indicates
that using a coarse mesh may lead to underpredictions of peak values.
