Abstract. We discuss the modeling of transient wave propagation with
the boundary element method (BEM) in three dimensions. The special
structure of the fundamental solution of the wave equation leads to a
close interaction of space and time variables in a so-called retarded timeargument. We give a detailed derivation of the discretization scheme and
analyse a new kind of ”geometrical light cone” singularity of the retarded potential function. Moreover, we present numerical experiments
that show these singularities.
Keywords: retarded potential, transient boundary element method.

Introduction

The simulation of sound radiation for automotive systems has become of great
industrial interest and here the transient boundary element method is a powerful
tool, especially for high frequency radiation phenomena. Nevertheless, the simulation of three dimensional time dependent problems is a challenging task. HaDuong [1] was able to prove the unconditional stability of the transient boundary
element method with Galerkin’s method in space and time. Hence, the question
arises, why have so many instabilities in numerical experiments been reported.
For a ﬁrst kind integral equation with the retarded single layer potential we perform a p-version boundary element method both in space and time. We address
especially the question of how to gain an accurate quadrature method. Thus we
analyse the potentials that arise in the computation of the Galerkin elements
and show that a new kind of ”geometrical light cone” singularity can cause severe inaccuracies in the computation of the Galerkin stiﬀness matrix. Therefore,
an accurate quadrature scheme which respects these singularities, e.g. by an
appropriate grading, needs to be used for the computation of the matrix entries.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we represent the solution u of the
Dirichlet problem of the wave equation via a single layer ansatz with unknown
density function p and derive a ﬁrst kind integral equation for p on the surface Γ
of the scatterer. For this integral equation we give a variational formulation which

we solve approximately with Galerkin’s method using piecewise polynomials in
space and time.
We show in detail how the retarded time argument in the kernel function of
the single layer potential inﬂuences the entries of the Galerkin stiﬀness matrix.
Here the time discretization leads to special ”domains of inﬂuence” Ek , annular
regions in space whose radii are given by the time discretization. If the triangle
of the trial function and Ek do not overlap, the resulting matrix entry vanishes.
For the computation of these entries, we introduce a new quadrature scheme
paying special attention to the interaction between the triangles and the domain
of inﬂuence. We show that the retarded integral operators poss ”geometrical
light cone” singularities (section 4). Finally, we present numerical experiments
in 3 conﬁrming this fact.

Model Problem and Single Layer Potential

Let us consider the transient sound radiation of some bounded domain Ω − , a
−
bounded open domain with connected complement Ω := R3 \Ω . We investigate
the wave equation for the displacement u(t, x) with t ∈ + , x ∈ Ω

with density function p and the retarded time argument t − |x − y|. The latter
connects the space and time variables and physically results in the retarded
signal of a source point. As we will see later, this retarded time argument has a
signiﬁcant impact on our discretization scheme. As the single layer potential S
is continuous everywhere, we have for its limit on Γ
V p(t, x) =

and using (3), there holds the boundary integral equation for p
f (t, x) = V p(t, x).

Note that the mapping V is continuous (see [1]). We can deduce the following

Due to the theory of Ha-Duong [1] this formulation is uniquely solvable in appropriate Sobolev spaces on Γ and [0, ∞). It can be solved approximately with
a Galerkin scheme in space and time for appropriate piecewise polynomial subspaces. For some convergence results see [1] and the references therein. We concentrate on suitable quadrature schemes for actually computing the Galerkin
solution leading to a fully discrete system discussed in the next section.

The Discrete Problem

In the following we denote by Nt the number of degrees of freedom in time
and by Ns the number of degrees of freedom in space. Let us assume, that the
boundary Γ is subdivided into triangles Tj with maximal diameter h and let us
assume that we have a decomposition of the time interval [0, T ] with T < ∞,
into Nt subintervals with step size Δt. Let tn = nΔt.
We discretize the variational form of the boundary integral equation (7) using
basis functions of order at least constant in both space and time, such that

The rather unusual domain Ek is due to the retarded time argument in the single
layer potential.
Let us now return to the evaluation of the Galerkin integrals (10). As the
matrix depends only on the time diﬀerence, we can translate our basis functions
γ m (t) and γ n (t) in time onto (t0 , t1 ) and (tk , tk+1 ), respectively. To simplify the
notation, we indicate all terms connected to the ansatz function γ m (t) with the
index A and for the test function γ n (t) with T , thus γ m (t) is of polynomial
degree pA and γ n (t) of degree pT . Using (11), applying the binomial series and

We see from (13) that the entries of the Galerkin matrix are given by a sum of
integrals with integration domains depending on the time step light cone and

with kernels only depending on the space variables. Therefore, returning to (9),
we can rewrite our Galerkin scheme with (8) as the linear system

where the matrix entries are deﬁned by (13).
We can formulate a time stepping algorithm for (14) as summarized in the
time stepping algorithm. In each time step we have to compute a new matrix
V n−m and a new solution vector φn . The matrices are sparsely populated due
to the restriction of the interaction of all triangles with the domain of inﬂuence
and, as the radii are time dependent and our body Ω − is bounded, at some point
the domain of inﬂuence has passed the body and the new matrices vanish. Note
that the system matrix V 0 remains the same in each time step. Also note that
F n is computed via numerical evaluation of the right hand side of (9).
As mentioned before, for the above algorithm severe numerical instabilities
have been reported, although Ha-Duong proved its unconditional stability [1].
In the next section we point out special ”geometrical light cone” singularities,
that occur in the computation of the inner integral of the integrals given in (13),
which have to be dealt with through the development of a suﬃciently accurate
quadrature scheme for the outer integral in (13) in order to achieve a suﬃciently
accurate quadrature for the integral.

Analysis of the Retarded Potential and Quadrature
Scheme

In this section we analyse the behavior of typical potential terms like (15) below.
Such an integral has a diﬀerent smoothness depending on whether the light cone

326

hits a corner or an edge of the triangle T , see the situations given in Fig. 4. As
we see in the proof of Theorem 1 the solution of the potential becomes singular
in the second case.
In the following we restrict ourselves to constant basis functions in space and
time and use a numerical quadrature for the outer integrals in (13). Let us take
y ∈ 3 as a quadrature point. Then, when the integration is performed only on
one triangle T ∈ 3 , the integration domain becomes

Ê

Ê

ET := {x ∈ T : rmin ≤ |x − y| ≤ rmax }

y∈

Ê3 (ﬁxed),

with 0 ≤ rmin < rmax . Thus the integrals are of the type
I(y) =

k(x, y)dsx ,

(15)

ET

where k(x, y) = |x − y|α for α ≥ −1. In the following, we will refer to (15) as
the potential integral.
Let us focus on the situation where the triangle T and the quadrature point
y lie in the same plane. Introduce a local coordinate system with respect to the
triangle T . The domain of inﬂuence of the triangle ET becomes for ﬁxed y ∈ 3
an annular ring. Therefore, we introduce polar coordinates (r, ϕ) in our local
coordinate system with origin y, orientate our triangle under these settings and
devide the triangle into elements of the type as sketched in Fig. 1. The upper

Ê

Fig. 1. 4 Quadrature Elements

and lower boundaries of all these elements can be parameterized as r(ϕ) and
hence the integrals (15) can be computed (both analytically and numerically).
The generalization to the situation where y and T do not lie in the same
plane can be solved by applying the above scheme, as the kernel k(x, y) only depends on the distance between x and y, see Fig. 2 (a more detailed description
of the quadrature scheme is given in [2,3]). The following theorem describes the
regularity of the typical potentials (15) and gives the most relevant singularities resulting from so-called edge-singularities. When taking higher derivatives
of the potentials even more singularities might appear, but this is not further
investigated here for brevity.
Theorem 1. The potential integrals (15), i.e. I( ) in (16) and (17), posses
”geometrical light cone” singularities, which are of order −1/2 ln for the case
α = −1. These singularities lie parallel to the triangle sides with distances rmin
and rmax as illustrated in Fig. 3.

Proof. In order to understand, what is happening when the light cone hits the
triangle we study the following two reference situations. Here we choose a ball of
ﬁxed radius R with center m ( ≥ 0) moving either towards an edge or a corner.
Note that R corresponds to rmin and rmax . These two reference situations are
sketched in Fig. 4.
For the corner, the reference situation (Fig. 4, left) is as follows. We have two
rays g1 and g2 given by γ 01 and γ 10 respectively, with γ ≥ 0. We move the
−R 1
center of the ball along 11 towards these rays with m = √
( ≥ 0). Thus

In order to understand, what happens when a sphere meets the edge of a
triangle (see Fig. 4, right), we choose a reference edge along γ 01 (γ ∈ ) and
a sphere with midpoint (−R, 12 )T . This sphere intersects with the edge at the
points S1 ( ) = (0, 12 +
(2R − ))T and S1 ( ) = (0, 12 −

What does this mean for (15)? The singularity for = R corresponds to the
case where y lies on the edge of a triangle in (15), and this corresponds to the

so called edge singularities for solutions of 3D boundary value problems, which
are singular due to the kernel. For = 0 and = 2R, we have geometrical
singularities that are occurring when the boundary of the light cone ET passes
the edge with the outer and inner circle with radius rmax and rmin , respectively.
If we apply the polar quadrature scheme described above to the reference
triangle with vertices (0, 0)T , (0, 1)T , (1, 0)T , we can observe exactly the behavior
discussed in Theorem 1. In the left plot of Fig. 5 we see the contour plot of
integral (15) with k(x, y) = |x − y|−1 . We ﬁx the usually time dependent radii
to rmax = 2.1 and rmin = 2.0 and evaluate (15) for y ∈ [−2.5, 3, 5]2. We observe
that the contour levels become dense at the propagated edges, see Fig. 3. This
observation is underlined by the right plot of Fig. 5, where the norm of the
gradient of (15) is plotted and the propagated edges become more visible. In
Fig. 6 the gradient of the potential of the triangle is plotted again as a 3D plot.

Let us ﬁnally remark, that the domain of inﬂuence of a triangle is of course a
three dimensional domain. In this paper we have restricted our analysis to the
case where a triangle T and a point of observation y are in the same plane, but
the main arguments hold true for the fully three dimensional case. This will be
a topic of a further paper. Here, our main result is that the classical near ﬁeld
and far ﬁeld notation of the elliptic integral operators does not hold true for
hyperbolic problems. Nevertheless, from our potential analysis (Thm. 1) we can
obtain a grading strategy for the outer quadrature of the Galerkin integrals.
