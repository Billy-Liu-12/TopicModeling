year has posed heat-related stress and health issues (Kovats and Hajat, 2008; Lo and Quattrochi, 2003;
Oikonomou et al., 2012), higher energy costs (Kolokotroni et al. 2012) and has downgraded urban
living quality (Mavrogianni et al., 2011), as pointed out in Berger (2016). A comprehensive
measurement of air temperature in earlier study (Wong and Chen, 2006) between 2001 and 2004
showed that the urban heat island in Singapore was about 4.5°C. A more recent study (Chow and Roth,
2006) found that the peak urban heat island intensity occurs approximately six hours after sunset at
central business districts, high-rise residential estate, and low-rise residential area. Higher urban heat
island intensities generally occur during the Southwest monsoon period of May – August, with a
maximum of ~7°C observed at Orchard Road at approximately 9pm local time (Chow and Roth, 2006).
A more comprehensive review of recent urban heat island studies in Singapore is conducted in Roth
and Chow (2012).
In Singapore, the majority of installed air-conditioning systems on high rise residential buildings
are split type air-conditioners, compact units rejecting heat from air-conditioning through a dry heat
exchange. They affect and in turn exposed to the urban microclimate in their vicinity, with regard to
capacity to provide cooling and the efficiency of their operation. One such microclimatic effect is the
stack effect, a buoyancy-driven airflow fueled by the hot air rejected from condensing units. Stack
effect of split type air-conditioners on high-rise buildings are simulated by CFD models as
summarized in Bojic et al. (2008) and observed in Bruelisauer et al. (2014).
In the view of respective contributions from different aspects of anthropogenic heat and built-up
area of a tropical city like Singapore, an integrated system needs to be established to identify the
individual effects of major heat sources and sinks. Heat sources include air-conditioners on buildings
at the small end of the scale and solar radiation at the large end of the scale. This paper discusses the
development of a new urban heat island modeling tool at multiple urban scales, focusing on the stack
effect induced by split type air-conditioners on high rise buildings and the effects of solar radiation on
thermal environment around buildings.

2 Methods
Three universal conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy are taken into account by
solving continuity equation (Equation (1)), Navier-Stokers equation (Equation (2)) and energy balance
equation (Equation (3)). Conjugate heat transfer is simulated by solving heat convection (Equation
(4)), conduction (Equation (5)) and radiation (Equation (6)) between fluid and solid regions.
Turbulence is solved by 𝑘𝑘 − 𝜀𝜀 model. Solar radiation is simulated by accounting for the combined
effects of the Sun primary hits, their reflective fluxes and diffusive sky radiative fluxes (Howell et al.
2010). The primary hit rays of solar radiation are calculated using a face shading algorithm. The
reflected fluxes are considered diffusive and use a view factors method to deposit the energy on visible
walls. The sky diffusive radiation for horizontal and vertical walls is calculated following the Fair
Weather Conditions Method from the ASHRAE Handbook.

OpenFOAM (www.openfoam.com) is implemented in this study as the core model, which is a free
and open source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software developed primarily by OpenCFD
Ltd since 2004 and distributed by OpenCFD Ltd and the OpenFOAM Foundation. The non-uniform
thermal boundary condition was defined by considering the solar irradiance that enables to include the
effect of shading and solar heating. Docker (www.docker.com) is employed to perform parallel
computing on the 128-core High Performance Computer (HPC) in Future Cities Laboratory of
Singapore-ETH Centre. Parallel computing together with the customized CFD program coupled with
solar radiation model to simulate conjugate heat transfer ensured the high-performance of this tool in
terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The total number of computational cells is 0.5 million and the
model forcing is specified in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.

3 Stack effect of split type air-conditioners on high rise
buildings
Stack effect of split type air-conditioners on high rise buildings are induced by the buoyancydriven airflow coming out from the condensing units with rejected heat. The increasingly hotter air
accumulated at higher levels of the same building will reduce the energy efficiency by increasing the
ambient air temperature, the heat sink for the air-conditioners. This effect has been modeled before
with ANSYS FLUENT (Bojic et al., 2008) with the same governing equations and more detailed set
up for the work process of air-conditioners. The effect was confirmed in field measurements in
Bruelisauer et al. (2014). The model uses the measurements of its case study to verify the tool.
The 24-storey Kent Vale Block H is chosen to study the stack effect of split type air-conditioners,
which is a staff housing unit of the National University of Singapore. The thermal picture, which
identifies the location of split type air-conditioners in the semi-column, together with the built CFD
model are shown in Figure 1.

3.1 Model validation
The CFD model is forced by the real settings of initial air temperature and velocity of each split
type air-conditioners on the north side of the Kent Vale Block H. The measurements of the stack effect
was carried out on 23 November 2012. More details can be found in Bruelisauer (2014). Since the airconditioners are located in the recessed area of Block H, horizontal wind is not considered in this
simulation. The patterns of the simulated distributions of air temperature (Figure 2) match well the
observed data in Bruelisauer et al. (2014). This indicates the tool is able to capture microclimatic
effects induced by split type air-conditioners on high rise buildings.

stack effect. Right: Horizontal air temperature distribution as temperature difference to ambient air temperature
against measured data (top right image from Bruelisauer (2014))

3.2 Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is performed by setting the indoor air temperature as 18 °C, 23 °C and 28 °C,
and outdoor air temperature as 28 °C, 32 °C and 36 °C, respectively. It is found that a stronger stack
effect can be observed with lower indoor (Figure 3) or higher outdoor air temperature (Figure 4),
which indicates both are sensitive parameters in determining the air temperature distribution pattern
outside split type air-conditioners.

4 Urban microclimate around high rise buildings
The built environment will absorb more solar radiation during daytime and emit more heat during
nighttime than rural area, which induces the diurnal cycle of urban heat island. Understanding the
interactions between buildings and solar radiation is fundamental for studying the UHI effect. The
whole of Kent Vale Residence (Figure 5) is simulated by forcing the model with solar radiation.

4.1 Model validation
Simulated solar radiation and air temperature on a typical day of each month are validated against
observed data provided by National University of Singapore Meteorological Station (Figures 6-8,

𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝑋𝑋𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 are the

involved in the calculation. 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑋𝑋𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 ) and 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑋𝑋𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 ) are the maximum and minimum observed data
among all involved quantities in the calculation, respectively. The calculation of observed solar
radiation in each month throughout the whole year around Kent Vale buildings can be found in Xu
(2016).
It is found that the simulated radiation, air temperature and air relative humidity generally agree
well with observations, with r of 0.99, 0.98, 0.98 and MAE(%) of 2%, 4%, 6%, respectively. This
shows that the modeling tool developed by coupling CFD model with the solar radiation model could
capture most portion of air temperature and air relative humidity. Much smaller solar radiation, lower
air temperature and higher air relative humidity in November and December are observed due to the
heavy rainfall during the Northeast monsoon season. Heavy rainfall will diffuse more solar radiation,
enhance evaporation of water on the group which low down the air temperature and increase the air’s
moisture. Since the atmospheric pressure in Singapore doesn’t change so much during one day, the
air’s relative humidity is found be to highly negatively correlated with the air temperature. Errors are
mainly from the neglected local effects such as trees, grasslands and swimming pools around buildings,
which affect the small scale dynamics of the time series of air temperature and air relative humidity. In
near future, the cooling effects of trees, grasslands, rivers, swimming pools and coastal seas will also
be taken into account in this modeling tool.
The tool could also be implemented to carry out design evaluation in terms of thermal environment.
This 0.54 million cells and 7cm resolution model takes 36 cores HPC around one hour to finish a 24
hours diurnal cycle simulation, which is efficient enough to support design evaluation purpose.

4.2 Solar radiation induced urban microclimate around high rise
buildings
As Singapore is located slight north to the equator, sun rises from Southeast and sets in Southwest
from around 23rd September to 22nd March, and rises from Northeast and sets in Northwest from 23 rd
March to 22nd September. This annual cycle of sun path phenomenon is well simulated with the
modeling tool, as shown in Figure 9.

throughout the whole year.

4.3 Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is performed by setting a high and low value of building radiation properties
(emissivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, reflectivity) and thermophysical properties (specific heat Cp
(in J/KgK), density (in Kg/m3) and thermal conductivity Kappa (in W/mK)), as tabulated in Table 4.
Comparison is made between these cases and the Base case. It is found that lower absorptivity, higher
reflectivity and larger thermal conductivity of the buildings could bring down the surrounding air
temperature and are sensitive parameters in determining thermal environment around buildings

(Figure 10). This could provide hints to architects and urban designers in drafting more environmental
friendly designs to help mitigate urban heat islands.

5 Conclusions and future work
A new urban heat island modeling tool is developed in this study to simulate stack effect of split
type air-conditioners on high-rise buildings and their surrounding thermal environment induced by
solar radiation. It is found that the tool can accurately simulate the stack effect of split type airconditioners on high-rise buildings, an effect which will not influences the urban microclimate but has
severe implications on the energy performance of the air-conditioners. The coupled CFD-solar
radiation model can simulate air temperature and air relative humidity accurately and efficiently with
conjugate heat transfer. The annual cycle of sun pathway in Singapore is well captured by this
modeling tool. To improve thermal environment around buildings and mitigate urban heat island, it is
suggested to use material of lower absorptivity, higher reflectivity and larger thermal conductivity for

234	

buildings. Architects and urban designers can be supported by simulations from this tool to evaluate
effects of different designs on the surrounding thermal environment.
Further sources of anthropogenic heat like traffic will be included in this modeling tool in the near
future. In addition, heat sinks such as trees and grasslands, waterbodies like swimming pools, rivers
and coastal seas will also be added into this integrated system to account for their cooling effects.
Further work will consist of implementing this modeling tool to evaluate different design strategies to
mitigate urban heat islands and urban microclimates, looking at new design of building facades, roofs
and cooling systems.
