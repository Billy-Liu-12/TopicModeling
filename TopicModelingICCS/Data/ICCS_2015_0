Abstract
Due to its popularity, social networks (SNs) have been subject to different analyses.
A research field in this area is the identification of several types of users and groups. To
make the identification process easier, a SN is usually represented through a graph.
Usual tools to analyze a graph are the centrality measures, which identify the most
important vertices. One of these measures is the PageRank (a measure originally
designed to classify web pages). Informally, in the context of a SN, the PageRank of a
user i represents the probability that another user of the SN is seeing the page of i after a
considerable time of navigation in the SN. In this paper, we define a new type of user in
a SN: the best current friend. Informally, the idea is to identify, among the friends of a
user i, who is the friend k that would generate the highest decrease in the PageRank of i
if k stops being his/her friend. This may be useful to identify the users/customers whose
friendship/relationship should be a priority to keep.

1 Introduction
Based on the relationships established by the members of a community, e.g., the users of a social
network (SN), different types of users and user groups can be identified. For instance, leader users
(Pedroche 2010b; Pedroche 2012), the best potential friends of a user (Moreno et al. 2013), the users
that exhibit a distrust behavior (Ortega et al. 2012), and the efficient information ‘spreaders’ (Kitsak et
al. 2010), among others. With regard to groups, in (Pedroche 2010a) user groups that compete for
visibility in the community are identified and in (Masuda et al. 2013) user groups of depressive and
suicidal communities are analyzed.
To facilitate the identification and analysis of these types of users and user groups, the community
of users and their relationships are usually represented through some mechanism. For example, a SN
is usually represented through a graph. Usual tools to analyze a graph are the centrality measures
(Masuda et al. 2013), which identify the most important vertices. These measures include the degree

centrality which measures the number of links of a node, the closeness centrality determined by the
length of the shortest paths from one node to the rest of the nodes of the network, the betweeness
centrality that is based on the total number of shortest paths that exist among all the pairs of nodes that
pass through a node, and the PageRank. The PageRank is a measure originally designed to classify
web pages (Page et al. 1999). Informally, the PageRank of a web page p represents the probability that
a web surfer is visiting p after a considerable time of navigation in the web.
In this short paper, we define a new type of user in a SN based on the PageRank: the best current
friend (BCF). Informally, our goal is to identify among the friends of a user i, who is the friend k that
would generate the highest decrease in the PageRank of i if k stops being his/her friend. This may be
useful to identify the users whose relationship (business, friendship, and family) should be a priority
to keep. These users are a key element for the executives and for a company to get future customers.
For instance, it is important for the sales executives of a company to detect this type of users to keep
and strengthen their relationships, e.g., offering them extra benefits and customized services.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the basic elements of the PageRank
method. In Section 3, we formally introduce the concept of the BCF based on the PageRank. In
Section 4, we conclude the paper and outline future work.

2 Basic Definitions
The users and their relationships in a SN may be represented by a graph. For example, consider a
SN with n = 5 users represented with a directed graph GSN = (N, E), where N represents the set of
nodes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and E the set of edges {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4,
5), (5, 2)}, see Figure 1. An edge (i, j) indicates that i is friend of j (i points to j). Note that this
representation supports both unidirectional and bidirectional relationships, e.g., in SNs such as Twitter
a user w follows a user z but z not necessarily follows w, i.e., they may exhibit a unidirectional

relationship.
Our goal is to classify the nodes (users) of a SN applying the PageRank method ( Page et al. 1999;
Pedroche 2010b; Pedroche 2012). Note that in a SN it is reasonable to assume that each user points to
at least to one friend (outlink). This is a mandatory condition to apply the PageRank method, i.e., there
must not be dangling nodes (Pedroche 2010b).

To apply the PageRank method, first we build a connectivity matrix H = (hij) ∈ Rn×n, 1  i, j  n,
that represents the links of each node. If there exists a link from node i to node j, i  j, then hij = 1,
otherwise hij = 0; if i = j then hii = 0.
From H matrix we build the row stochastic matrix P = (pij) ∈ Rn×n, 1  i, j  n. A matrix is row
stochastic if the sum of the elements of each of its rows is 1. P is calculated by dividing each element
hij by the sum of the elements of row i of H. Note that because we assume that there do not exist
dangling nodes then this sum (in each row) cannot be zero.
The PageRank method requires that the P matrix, in addition to be row stochastic, must be
primitive. A non-negative square matrix is primitive (Varga 2009) if the number of distinct
eigenvalues of the matrix whose absolute value is equal to the spectral radius ρ(P) is 1, where ρ(P) is
the maximum value (in absolute value) of its eigenvalues. To ensure this property (and still preserving
the row stochastic property), we apply the following transformation (Page et al. 1999; Pedroche
2007).
G = ĮP + (1 − Į)evT
Where G is known as Google matrix. Į is a damping factor, 0 < Į < 1, and represents the
probability with which the surfer of the network moves among the links of the H matrix, and (1- Į)
represents the probability of the surfer to randomly navigate to a link which is not among the links of
H. Note that if Į = 1, then G = P, i.e., we would be working with the initial P matrix. Usually, Į is set
to 0.85, a value that was established by Brin and Page, the creators of the PageRank method (Page et
al. 1999; Pedroche 2007). In (Becchetti & Castillo 2006; Boldi 2005) the effect of several values of Į
is analized.
On the other hand, e ∈ Rn×1 is the vector of all ones and vTe = 1. v is called personalization or
teletransportation vector and may be used to affect (to benefit or to harm) the ranking of the nodes of
the network (Pedroche 2007): v = (vi) ∈ Rn×1: vi > 0, 1  i  n. Usually, v = (1/n) and is known as the
basic personalization vector. However, if we want to affect the ranking of a specific node i, v may be
defined as follows: Let 0 < ε < 1 then vi = (vij) ∈ Rn×1: vij = ε / (n - 1) for i  j, vii = 1 - ε,. Thus, when ε
is close to zero, the ranking of node i tends to increase, but if ε is close to one, its ranking tends to
decrease. A value commonly used in the literature for ε is 0.3. We denote PPR (Personalized
PageRank) as the PageRank of a node using some pre-scribed personalization vector vj and we denote
PRj the PageRank vector computed using vj. From G matrix we can compute the PageRank vector π.
To compute vectorπ we consider the following system of equations πT = πTG, where πT = [q1 q2 q3 q4
q5]. In addition, to ensure that π is a probability vector, we also consider the equation: q1 + q2 + q3 + q4
+ q5 = 1. For the running example, we solved the system using MATLAB; results are showed in Table
1. Results show that node 2 has the highest PageRank whereas node 5 has the lowest one.

3 The BCF
We introduce the concept of the BCF of a node in a SN. The BCF of a node i is the node k of the
SN, k ≠ i, H[k, i] = 1, such that if k stops being friend of i (k stops pointing to i), k is the node that
generates the highest decrease in the PageRank of i. That is, let GSN = (N, E) be the initial graph that
represents the SN. Let ʌi(GSN) denote the i component of the PPR for some personalization vector v.
Given i ‫ א‬N, let: Q(i ) = { j ‫ א‬N: i  j, (j, i) ‫ א‬E }, i.e., the set of nodes that point to i. Let E’(j, i) = E {(j, i)}, with some j ‫ א‬Q(i ), i.e., the initial set of edges E minus the edge from j to i, and let GSN’(j, i)
= (N, E’(j, i)). Then we say that k ‫ א‬Q(i) is the BCF of i if the following condition holds: ʌi(GSN’(k,
i)) = min(ʌi(GSN’(j, i))), j ‫ א‬Q(i).
Example. Consider the SN of Figure 1. Currently the PageRank of node 2 (the node with the
highest PageRank) is 0.2944. In Table 2, we show the change in the PageRank of this node depending
on the node that has been disconnected. In this example, node 1 is the BCF of node 2 because if it is
disconnected, it will be the node that decreases the most the PageRank in the node 2.

4 Conclusions and Future Works
In this paper, a new type of user in a SN, the BCF, was formally defined. Based on the PageRank,
it was determined which is the friend of a user i whose friendship is more important to keep because
in case it gets lost, this would generate the highest decrease in the PageRank of i. The identification of
the BCF could be decisive for a user when keeping the visibility and influence in the SN. As future
work, we plan to implement the corresponding algorithm to identify the BCF and to conduct a series
of experiments with real social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter.
As future work, we also consider as relevant aspects the following: to define the BCF in terms of
other centrality measures, to compare the results among them, and to determine correlations if there is
any. For instance, if a node k is the BCF of a node i when considering a centrality measure c then,
¿how close is k to be the BCF of i when another centrality measure is considered? Another work is the
development of a visual tool that allows the analyst to identify, in a friendly way, the BCF of each
node, and that also permits the interactive manipulation of the SN (addition and removal of
nodes/relationships), and that shows the way the BCF of each node is affected given these changes.
This could lead to the understanding of how the relationships of other users of the SN affect a node i
and to its corresponding BCF. At the same time, this could lead to the identification of “the best
external friendship” with regard to a node i, i.e., among all the couples of friends in a SN (couples that

do not include i), which is the couple that generate the highest decrease in the PageRank of i if this
couple fell out.
