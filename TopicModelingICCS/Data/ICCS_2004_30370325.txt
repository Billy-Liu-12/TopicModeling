Abstract. Magainin-2 is a natural peptide that kills bacteria at concentrations
that are harmless to animal cells. Molecular modelling methods were applied to
investigate basic mechanisms of magainin-2 amide (M2a) membrane selectivity. Three computer models of a lipid matrix of either animal or bacterial membrane containing M2a were constructed and simulated. Specific interactions
between membrane lipids and M2a peptides, responsible for M2a selectivity are
elucidated.

1 Introduction
Magainin-2 (M2, GIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS) is a natural, 23-amino acid
cationic peptide expressed in the skin of an African frog Xenopus leavis. M2 selectively kills bacteria at concentrations that are harmless to animal cells. In organic solvents and in the vicinity of a lipid bilayer, M2 forms an α-helix of a distinct hydrophobic moment [1]. Such a helix possesses a polar and non-polar face. At the
physiological conditions, the total electrostatic charge of M2 amide (M2a), which was
used in this study, is +4 e. It results from the positively charged N-terminus, four
positively charged Lys and one negatively charged Glu residues. By physical interactions with the membrane lipids, M2a disturbs the lamellar structure of the lipid matrix
of biomembranes. The extent of this disturbance depends on the lipid composition of
the membrane, particularly on the content of anionic lipids, as well as the peptide-tolipid ratio.
The lipid matrix of the animal plasma membrane consists mainly of neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol (Chol) molecules. In contrast, the main lipid
components of the bacterial membrane are neutral phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
and negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecules. Due to a positive
charge, the effect of M2a molecules on the bacterial membrane is stronger than on the
animal membrane. In the initial stage of interaction with the membrane, M2a molecules locate on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. In the animal membrane, interactions between M2a, PC, and Chol are such that push peptide molecules away from
the surface. In the bacterial membrane, when the peptide-to-lipid (P/L) ratio is above
1:40 [2], M2a together with PG form large openings in the membrane [2, 3]. The
openings (toroidal pores) consist of 4 - 7 M2a and several PG molecules.

In this study, molecular modelling methods were applied to investigate basic
mechanisms of M2a membrane selectivity. This selectivity results from specific interactions between membrane lipids and M2a peptides. Three computer models of membrane systems were constructed and simulated. The first and second systems constituted, respectively, model animal and bacterial membranes each containing two M2a
molecules located horizontally on the membrane surface (carpet models, EUCARPET
and PROCARPET, respectively). The third system consisted of a model bacterial
membrane containing five M2a molecules that together with PG molecules formed a
toroidal pore in the membrane centre (PORE). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of the carpet models were carried out for 12 ns and of PORE for 5 ns.

2 Methods
2.1 Simulation Systems
As a model of the animal membrane, a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine
(POPC) bilayer containing ~23 mol% cholesterol (Chol) was used. Both POPC and
Chol are major constituents of the animal plasma membrane. Details concerning the
POPC-Chol bilayer construction are given in [4]. The EUCARPET system contained
–
68 POPC, twenty Chol, two M2a, eight Cl , and 2533 water molecules (12647 atoms
in total). Chlorine ions were added to neutralise +8 e charge on two M2a molecules.
As a model of the bacterial membrane, a bilayer made of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol
(POPG) in ratio 3:1 was used. Such a lipid composition is typical for the inner bacterial membrane. The PROCARPET system contained 66 POPE, twenty two POPG,
+
two M2a, fourteen Na , and 2614 water molecules (12414 atoms in total). Fourteen
sodium ions together with two M2a molecules neutralised –22 e charge on POPG
molecules. Details concerning the POPE-POPG bilayer construction are given in [5].
The PORE system contained 138 POPE, 46 POPG (25 mol% POPG), five M2a,
+
twenty six Na , and 5909 water molecules (28457 atoms in total). The toroidal pore
was built according to the model proposed by Ludtke et al. [2] of five M2a and twenty
POPG molecules (Fig. 1). In the pore, lipids interpose magainin helices oriented perpendicular to the membrane surface such that the polar faces of the amphiphilic helices and the polar heads of the lipids constitute the pore lining. As a result, both membrane leaflets form a continuous surface, which allows for free diffusion of lipids
between the outer and inner membrane layers. Details concerning the construction of
PORE are given in [6].
2.2 Simulation Parameters
For POPC, POPE, POPG, M2a, and Chol, optimised potentials for liquid simulations
(OPLS) [7], for water, TIP3P [8], and for sodium and chlorine ions, Aqvist’s pa+
–
rameters were used. Phospholipid, peptide, Na , and Cl molecules were treated as the
solute molecules and water was the solvent. The united-atom approximation was applied to the CH, CH2, and CH3 groups of the peptide and lipid molecules. All polar
groups of the solute and solvent molecules were treated in full atomic detail. The nu-

merical values for the atomic charges of POPE and POPG are given in [5] and of
POPC follow those in Charifson et al. [9]. To retain the double bond in the oleoyl
chain of phospholipids in the cis conformation, restraints on the double bond dihedral
-1
-2
were imposed with a force constant of 100 kcal·mol ·rad . Restraints acted whenever
the deviation from an ideal conformation of 0° exceeded ±30°. Procedures for supplementing the original OPLS base with the missing parameters for the lipid headgroup were described by Pasenkiewicz-Gierula et al. [10], and those for the β-chain
sp2 carbon atoms by Murzyn et al. [11]. Chiral centres in POPE, POPG, and POPC
molecules were kept in a chosen configuration by defining relevant improper torsions.
Improper torsions were parameterised in the OPLS forcefield with the half of the po-1
-2
tential barrier equal to 14.0 kcal·mol ·rad , periodicity of 3 and the energy maximum
at 0°.

shown as light ribbons, the Lys and Phe residues are shown as sticks, and phospholipid molecules (mainly POPG) are shown in white as lines. For clarity, water molecules were removed

2.3 Simulation Conditions
All three bilayer systems contain charged molecules and ions, therefore, in the MD
simulations, long-range electrostatic and van der Waals interactions were evaluated
by means of the Particle-Mesh-Ewald (PME) summation method [12]. A real cutoff
of 12 Å, with a β-spline interpolation order of 5, and a direct sum tolerance of 10-6
were used. Three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions were employed. The

328

simulations were carried out using AMBER 5.0 [13]. The SHAKE algorithm [14] was
used to preserve the bond lengths of the OH, NH, and NH2 groups of water and peptide molecules. The list of nonbonded pairs was updated every 25 steps.
The MD simulations were carried out at a constant pressure (1 atm) and at a temperature of 310 K (37 ºC). The temperatures of the solute and solvent were controlled
independently by the Berendsen method [15]. The applied pressure was controlled
anisotropically, each direction being treated independently with the trace of the pressure tensor kept constant for 1 atm, again using the Berendsen method [15]. The relaxation times for temperatures and pressure were set at 0.4 and 0.6 ps, respectively.
The bilayers were simulated for 12 ns (EUCARPET and PROCARPET) and 5 ns
(PORE). For analyses, last 10-ns fragments of EUCARPET and PROCARPET trajectories and the last 3-ns fragment of PORE trajectory were used. The average values given below are ensemble and time averages obtained from the block averaging
procedure. Errors in the derived average values are standard error estimates.
2.4 Analyses
The instantaneous orientation of the peptide molecules in the bilayers was monitored
using a rigid body quaternion fit as implemented in MMTK package [16]. Details are
given in [6]. The reference helical structure of the M2a molecule was the experimentally determined peptide structure [1].

3 Results
3.1 Short Distance Lipid-Peptide Interactions
3.1.1 Animal Membrane
In EUCARPET, M2a molecules are positioned in the interfacial region of the membrane. Such localisation allows them to interact both with the polar and non-polar
fragments of POPC and Chol molecules. The side-chains of polar and charged amino
acids interact with the phosphate and carbonyl groups of POPC and the hydroxyl
group of Chol via direct hydrogen bonds (H-bond) and water bridges (WB). The largest contribution to M2a-POPC polar interactions have two Lys residues (Lys10 and
14), and to M2a-Chol polar interactions has Glu19 (Fig. 2). The side-chains of nonpolar residues and non-polar fragments of POPC and Chol interact via van der Waals
interactions. The largest contribution to M2a-POPC non-polar interactions have
mainly aromatic residues (Phe7, 12, and 16), and to M2a-Chol non-polar interactions
mainly aliphatic residues (Ile2, Leu6, and Val17). Numbers of M2a-lipid interactions
are given in Table 1.
3.1.2 Bacterial Membrane
In PROCARPET, localisation of M2a molecules is similar to that in EUCARPET.
Nevertheless, non-polar interactions between M2a and phospholipids are significantly
stronger than in EUCARPET, particularly those of Phe12 and Phe16. The number of
direct M2a-lipid H-bonds is similar in both membranes, whereas the number of M2a-

lipid water bridges is much less than in EUCARPET. The largest contribution to
M2a-lipid polar interactions have Lys4, 10, and 11, and Gly19. Numbers of M2a-lipid
interactions are given in Table 1.

3.1.3 Toroidal Pore
In PORE, M2a molecules together with POPG headgroups form a toroidal pore. Even
though M2a are located perpendicular to the bilayer surface, their local environment
is similar to the interfacial region of PROCARPET. Consequently, the pattern of polar
and non-polar interactions between peptide and lipid molecules are to a large extent
similar to those in PROCARPET. Numbers of M2a-lipid interactions are given in Table 1. The strongest contribution to polar interactions arises from all four Lys residues, whereas to non-polar interactions arises form all three Phe residues.

3.2 Orientation and Conformation of Peptide Molecules in the Membrane
3.2.1 Animal Membrane
The M2a molecules in EUCARPET remain nearly parallel to the bilayer surface and
their orientation is similar to the initial one. Strong H-bonding between two Chol
molecules and Glu19 of one M2a molecule (Fig. 2) results in a local loss of helicity of
this molecule.
3.2.2 Bacterial Membrane
The M2a molecules in PROCARPET also remain nearly parallel to the bilayer surface
nevertheless, their orientation differs from the initial one. The peptides rotated about
their long axes by an average angle of ~15º.
3.2.3 Toroidal Pore
The M2a molecules in PORE fluctuate about the orientation perpendicular to the
membrane surface. Like in PROCARPET, the peptide molecules underwent limited
rotation about their long axes.

4 Conclusions
1. Interactions between Chol and M2a in EUCARPET impeded favourable interaction of the peptide with membrane phospholipids. On the longer time scale, this
may lead to desorption of the peptide from the membrane surface.
2. M2a molecules in PROCARPET, by rotating about their long axes, assumed orientation that maximises their interaction with both polar and non-polar groups of
phospholipids. These interactions affect the organisation of both interfacial and
hydrophobic membrane region. On the longer time scale, this may lead to local
destruction of the membrane lamellar structure.
3. M2a-lipd interactions in PORE are similar to those in PROCARPET. These interactions stabilize the pore structure.
