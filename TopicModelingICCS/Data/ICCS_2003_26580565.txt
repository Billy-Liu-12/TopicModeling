Abstract. We present some Monte Carlo simulation results for a twodimensional unsteady problem of gas flow in an extremely narrow channel with
an inclined upper wall and moving lower one. This is a model of gas film
lubrication in modern magnetic disk storage, which is now under development.
In order to account for non-uniform inner and outer structure of the boundary
incoming and outgoing flows the DSMC simulations in the channel as well as
in adjacent to inlet and outlet regions of linear size 20 are coupled at their
boundaries to continuum finite element solution for the outer flow around the
magnetic head. The coupling of DSMC simulation with this continuum solution
is realized as step by step approximation. It is found that the pressure before and
after the channel differs markedly from the atmospheric one because of the
slowing down of the flow by magnetic head. Thus previously much used
atmospheric pressure boundary conditions are unreal. Space and time
distributions of different flow parameters are given.

1 Introduction
Flows with some of its linear dimension R having the order of several nanometers, are
now often found in high technological processes and thus are of growing importance.
The mean free path (mfp) λ for NTP in air is equal to 62 nm so the Knudsen number
Kn=λ/R may be close to unity. They are in transitional regime and it is just the case
for the gap flow in the modern Winchester-type disk drives [1]-[3]. Thus the current
trend toward nanoscale technology in the slider air bearing causes the previous design
calculations based on continuum Reynolds equation or on the simulation of the whole
slider region with surrounding external flow by solving the Navier-Stokes equations
[4] to be changed by some microscopic solution at least in the part of the
computational region. In this occasion the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
method introduced by Bird [5] is particularly suitable and was employed in [2], [3],
[6] for a stationary flow problem by calculating some important parameters of a slider
air bearing.

In this method molecular collisions and their free motion are directly simulated,
but at the same time it is introduced a stochastic process which approximately
replaces comprehensive description of particle dynamics, especially for molecular
collisions.
Under fulfillment of certain restrictions on the mean numbers of molecules in the
computational cells and the value of the time step this process can be approximated
by a Poisson process [7]. But the same restrictions demand changing Bird’s selection
procedure for calculating of molecular collisions to a selection without replacement
back already collided in this time step molecules. The new selection procedure was
implemented with the help of a special additional array and the displacement in it of
the collided particles to the right and reducing the number of molecules during
selection only to those on the left, not yet collided. Thus removing an odious
phenomenon in the Bird’s algorithm namely potential repeated collision of the pair
just collided molecules which is possible because of too strong violation of the
microscopic dynamics produced by that selection with replacement.
For performance evaluation of a Winchester-type disk drive under the transient
conditions one needs to know unsteady characteristics of the flow. In this paper we
present some results from Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional unsteady
problem of gas flow in an extremely narrow channel with an inclined upper wall and
moving lower one. This is a model of gas film lubrication, which occurs in modern
magnetic disk storage, now being under development. Due attention is given to nonuniform inner and outer structure of the boundary incoming and outgoing flows. This
is accomplished by simultaneous continuum finite element solution for the outer flow
around the magnetic head. By parallel implementation of our program on the clusters
of St. Petersburg University with special load balance technique against computer
breakdown to secure simultaneous run of it on several clusters we were able to obtain
enough independent realizations for an ensemble average of the simulation results.

2 Statement of the Problem
It is considered a two-dimensional simulation problem for flow around the magnetic
head and inside the channel, which is formed by the latter with the hard disc moving
with constant velocity Uw,
see Fig.1. In this channel
and in the additional
regions of 20l height and
long before and after the
head a numerical solution
was obtained with the help
of DSMC method which
was coupled along the
boundaries at 0C and CD
on the left and GF, FE on the right with a continuous finite element solution of
Navier-Stokes equations. The latter produces boundary conditions for DSMC
simulations by forming fluxes, which are calculated from mean velocities and its
derivatives on these boundaries. Molecular interactions are taken to be the hard sphere
one and their interaction with the wall was diffuse reflection. The square cells in

Parallel Implementation of the DSMC Method

DSMS computational region had the linear size of approximately /3 and time step Dt
-11
was less than one third of the molecular mean free time (mft) Dt =4·10 . The height
of the inlet and outlet in the channel was equal to 2 and accordingly. The initial
rotation of the lower wall which models the magnetic media of the disk drive for
small time interval can be approximated as being set moving instantly with linear
speed Uw from the rest in a direction parallel to itself and thereafter maintained in
uniform motion. The speed Uw was taken to be 75m/s, which is representative for the
4
devices of 10 rpm of the media with the 3.5in diameter. The flow itself is formed
because the air molecules after diffuse reflection from this wall are carried along this
motion.
The coupling procedure was realized as a step by step approximation. First in the
whole computational region Navier-Stokes equations were solved by finite element
method with diminishing cell size in these additional regions and the channel. As the
boundary conditions for this solution is quite far from the head at x=Xb and x=-Xb
asymptotic solution of the Rayleigh problem obtained by Cercignani and et al. [8] was
used.

Though employment of continuum equations near inlet, outlet and inside of the
channel is inadequate one can expect that on the boundaries 0CDEFG which are 20l
apart from them the influence of these small bad parts will be insignificant. So, at the
next step within this part the DSMC method was employed with incoming molecular
fluxes calculated from the stored mean velocities and their derivatives at these
boundaries obtained at the previous step. Details of this procedure are outlined in the
next section.

3 Simulations of the Incoming Fluxes
The linear size of the cells in finite element solution was four times and its time step
was 25 times larger than in DSMC simulation, so that an interpolation of the stored
macroscopic parameters was used. Molecular properties in a Navier-Stokes solution
are represented through the Chapmen-Enskog velocity distribution function f(u,v,w).
It contains spatial derivatives of mean velocities and temperature. As in our problem
there is no boundary temperature differences in the data and all mean velocities are
relatively small in comparison with the sound velocity as (as=320m/s) we have
neglected the temperature derivatives in f(u,v,w). Simulations confirmed this
assumption and the corresponding evidence will be presented later on in Sect. 4.

But now with decart thermal velocity components u=(u’-uav)/VT, v=(v’-vav)/VT,
2
w=w’/VT being related to the most probable velocity VT , VT =2kT/m, where m is the
molecular mass and k – Boltzmann’s constant, it can be represented in the form:

(

)

f (u , v , w ) = f 0 (u , v , w ) 1 − α 1 u 2 − α 2 v 2 + α 3 w 2 − α uv ,

(2)

where all the coefficients in the bracket are less then 1, and f0(u,v,w) is the Maxwell
velocity distribution function,

[(

f 0 (u , v, w) = π −3 2 exp − u 2 + v 2 + w 2

And coefficients

are given by the formulas:

It is seen that coefficients ai are connected by relation a1 + a2 =a3. The value of the
-9
dimensional constant c0 is only 0.35·10 s. From finite element solution mean
velocities and their derivatives on the boundary 0CD and EFG (cl. Fig.1 ) at different
time moments are stored in special file and then they are red during DSMC
simulations and used for simulating boundary incoming fluxes inside the DSMC
computational region. For the latter procedure the magnitude of these coefficients ai.
is very important. On Fig.2 a) their absolute values Ab for some particular time
moment are represented. It is seen that on the vertical boundaries 0C and FG
coefficient a, which is shown by dashed line, exceeds strongly the others. Large cells
of the finite element solution numbered by Nc with the help of the letters 0, C, D, E, F,
G are made to correspond with the boundary shown on the Fig.1. Magnitudes of all
coefficients change little for other time moments so that their value relation is
maintained. In order to see more details of the coefficients ai they are shown on the
Fig.2 b) on a larger scale. The largest combination of derivatives in our SUREOHP IRU
8 -1
amounts to or less than 10 s . As the value of the dimensional constant c0 is only
-9
2
-3
0.35¼10 seconds, the squared value a reaches correspondingly utmost 10 and in
what follows it will be neglected in comparison with 1. The same is true for the other
coefficients ai. Thus in the simulation of incoming fluxes one can neglect the
coefficient squared in comparison with 1.

Simulation of the decart velocity component for the incoming molecules from the
multidimensional distribution can be proceeded by forming consequently conditional
densities. As an example let us take velocity simulation of the molecules incoming
through the boundary CD (cl. Fig.1). Consider simulation Z-component that is normal
to the plane in Fig.1. Going over to one-dimensional density P(w) according to

(9)

where in fact by the adopted precision there is no dependence on w1 according to (8)
and C is a norm constant not important for simple acceptance-rejection technique [5]
utilized for obtaining the simulated value v1.
Now by using (2) with adopted precision the conditional density

P3(u|v1, w1)=f(u,v1, w1)/P(w1) P2(v1/w1),
where v1 is a value of v velocity component already simulated by above mentioned

4 Simulation of the Temperature
In order to confirm the possibility of using the expression (2) for the ChapmanEnskog velocity distribution function f(u,v,w) for our case we performed simulations
to evaluate the temperature changes. Determine kinetic temperature for X-velocity

component by Tx=m(<u >-<u> )/k, where <u > and <u> are simulated mean values.
Determining in the same way Ty and Tz as well as the general temperature T through
T=(Tx+Ty+Tz)/3 we have simulated this temperature T. On the Fig.3 are shown the
results of this simulation.
On the left a) of magnetic head (cl. Fig.1) it is depicted for different times: by solid

right b), it is represented for region after the outlet with the same designation of the
curves. In both cases the distance is given in mfp units. It is clearly seen that except
for some statistical scattering the space temperature changes are not noticeable so that
in general Chapmen-Enscog expression the space temperature derivatives could be
really neglected.

5 Numerical Evaluation of the Present Coupling Scheme
The step by step approximation used in the present paper for coupling of two
solutions was evaluated by comparison of successive approximations for mean
velocity components uav and vav as well as for density nav at the boundary 0CDEFG (cl.
Fig.1) inevitably at particular time moment. But as a matter of fact for the other times
the whole picture is roughly the same. The relative differences of zero approximation
as obtained from the finite element solution and the first one after DSMC simulations
0

Ru=(u av–u av)/u av and in the same way for Rv and Rn are shown on the Fig.4. The
relative differences for X-velocity component Ru as shown on the left in Fig.4
oscillate near a zero level with peak-to-peak values mostly less than 10% but
somewhat grow between 26<Nc<50 where the component uav is itself small so that
statistical scattering becomes larger being apparently the origin of it.

The relative differences for Y-velocity component Rvav =(v av - v av )/v av are shown
in Fig.4 on the right. Their chaotic oscillations near zero level with peak values
amount to 15%. As the vav magnitude is mostly much less than that of uav , it can be
0
explained again by statistical scattering. The relative density differences Rnav=( n av1
1
n av)/ n av are shown on Fig.5. It is clearly seen that they vary near the 1%-2% level of
precision with peak-to-peak values of about 3%.

Thus one can say that except the random statistical scattering inherent to DSMC
method the mean level of these relative differences does not exceed 15%. So that
convergence of this step-by-step coupling approximation is satisfactory.

6 Numerical Simulation Results
Simulations for our DSMC parallel code were performed on the St. Petersburg

university clusters. The largest of them contains 40 SURFHVVRUV ,QWHO 3HQWLXP
MHz. Parallelization of the code was proceeded through independent realizations
when each processor produced the whole solution, the results being gathered then on
some leading one for averaging and outputting. This scheme allowed us sometimes
use an additional cluster located far away but connected with one of the ours through
the Internet channel into a metacomputer with good efficiency, for details see [9].
All previous researchers [2], [3], [6] have used the assumption that before the inlet
and after outlet of the channel unperturbed atmospheric pressure could be used as the
boundary condition. Thus they entirely neglected the slowing down of the flow by
magnetic head. We are now in a position to check it.

Fig. 6. Increase of the pressure p before the channel inlet for different times.

For this purpose we simulated pressure before the channel and represented it for
the height y= /3 on the Fig.6 with the time symbols for the curves as in the foregoing
and by the horizontal bold solid line the atmospheric pressure. It is clearly seen that
the slowing down of the flow is present by a 8% increase in pressure before the

channel inlet.Thus one may conclude that the pressure boundary conditions used in
previous papers at least for Uw75m/s are not fulfilled. Both of the pressures before
and after the magnetic head are not atmospheric and are quite different near the inlet
and outlet.
On the Fig.7 the pressure along the channel is shown for different times with the

Conclusions
Based on the coupling of the DSMC method with a continuum solution at the outer
regions it is found considerable deviations from the atmospheric pressure before and
after the channel. Thus quality of the pressure boundary conditions much used in the
previous papers on this topic seems to be doubtful. Space and time distributions of
different parameters of the flow are given.
