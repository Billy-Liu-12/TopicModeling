Abstract. We discuss the use of the computer algebra system Maple
to analyze the heat transport when a heated sphere melts its way
through a solid medium. The combined power of symbolic computation
and numerical simulation available in Maple is used to analyze a model
in which the molten layer around the moving sphere is augmented by a
surrounding thermal-layer. In particular, we carefully study the eﬀects
of imposing a variety of boundary conditions.

Introduction

The power of large-scale simulations has had a major impact in advancing the
understanding of physical processes in a multitude of applications. In many circumstances, the careful analysis of the model and an understanding of the eﬀects
of particular model parameters can create an eﬃcient feedback mechanism which
iteratively improves the model and provides insights into the underlying physical
phenomena. Using diﬀerent approximations for unknowns in a model, or comparing the eﬀects of diﬀerent boundary conditions are useful tools in this feedback
cycle. In this paper, we use the power of Maple to advance the understanding
of a model for Stokes’ problem with melting. In particular, we study the eﬀects
of changing boundary conditions that aﬀect the basic unknowns of the model.
The classical Stokes’ problem calculates the drag on a sphere moving at a constant velocity through a viscous, ﬂuid medium. “With melting” assumes that the
sphere maintains it surface temperature above that of the surrounding medium
due to some internal heat source, the heat from the sphere is suﬃcient to melt a
region around it, and the sphere falls through the melted region until it attains
a steady state velocity. The model describes situations ranging from magma migration and core formation to that of a run-away nuclear reactor melting its way
through the earth [3]. In section 2 we introduce the integral balance method
and its innovative use in Stokes’ ﬂow with melting proposed by Emerman and
Turcotte [1]. We study the eﬀects of imposing improved boundary conditions for
the velocity, and demonstrate that this leads to an improved estimate for the
melt-layer. Section 3 highlights the diﬀerences between the melt-layer model and
a more accurate two-layer approach [2] where a phenomenological thermal layer
is added beyond the melt layer. The boundary condition for the temperature
proﬁle used in the melt-layer model of section 2 leads to certain anomalies which

are resolved by the two-layer model. The thickness of the thermal-layer is obtained as a series approximation by re-applying the integral balance method on
the thermal-layer. This approximation for the thermal-layer thickness is needed
to impose the correct boundary condition for the temperature proﬁle in the meltlayer. A repeat of the integral balance method in the melt-layer then yields the
melt-layer thickness.

Integral Balance Method: Melt-Layer Model

In the integral balance method, it is assumed that heat is transported over
some distance δ, and the heat conduction equation is integrated over this thermal layer thickness to obtain the integral heat balance. Appropriate boundary
conditions and a trial function of a spatial variable are assumed for the temperature proﬁle, leading to an expression involving the spatial variable and δ.
Substituting this expression into the integral heat balance leads to a diﬀerential equation for δ which is solved to obtain an expression for the thermal layer
thickness. Finally, the temperature proﬁle is obtained through direct substitution. Emerman and Turcotte [1] employed the integral balance method to
obtain an expression for the non-dimensional melt layer thickness, δ(θ). The
relevant geometry is displayed in Figure 1. Using the non-dimensional variables
θ = x/R, y = y/R, δ = d/R, u = u/u0 , v = v/u0 , and T = (T − Tm )/(T0 − Tm ),
the Navier Stokes equation in lubrication form with boundary conditions u(0) =
u(δ) = 0 leads to u(y) = −(3y sin θ)(y − δ)/δ 3 . The Stefan number is deﬁned as
c (T −Tm )
where cp is the speciﬁc heat capacity of melt, L is the latent
Ste = L+cp p (T0 m −T
∞)
heat of fusion, and T∞ is the ambient temperature of the medium and the Peclet
number is deﬁned as Pe = u0 R/κ, where κ is the thermal diﬀusivity of melt.
Ste and Pe form the dimensionless groups for the problem in non-dimensional
form. Assuming a quadratic proﬁle for temperature T(y) and imposing the conditions T(0) = 1, T(δ) = 0 and ∂T/∂y = −Pe cos θ/Ste, when y = δ yields

stituting the expressions for u(y) and T(y) into the integral heat balance and
solving the resulting diﬀerential equation for δ(θ) produces the melt-layer thickness as δET (θ) = δET (0) sec θ = f (Ste) sec θ/Pe, where f (z) = 0.25(−3z − 20 +
√
9z 2 + 280z + 400). Complete details of the derivation in this form can be found
in [1, 2]. The energy equation for this model leads to ∂ 2 T/∂y2 = 0 when y = 0,
which yields the approximation δ = δET0 (θ) = (Ste/Pe) sec θ. It is easily veriﬁed
that as Ste → 0, f (Ste) → Ste. Thus for small values of Ste, δET0 ≈ δET while
always satisfying δET0 > δET .

Boundary Conditions for Velocity

The boundary condition u(δ) = 0 is a good approximation under the assumption
δ << 1, but is clear that the correct boundary condition at the boundary of
the melt-layer is u(δ) = − sin θ. Solving for the velocity using this improved
boundary condition results in u(y) = −3y sin θ(y − δ + yδ − 23 δ 2 )/δ 3 . Using this
expression for u(y) and assuming the temperature proﬁle given above, a modiﬁed

melt layer thickness, δM (θ), is easily computed. Unlike the melt-layer expressions
δET0 (θ) and δET (θ) which become inﬁnite as θ → π/2, δM (π/2) is ﬁnite. Table 1
shows the relative percentage errors as a function of the Peclet number Pe and the
Stefan number Ste as the colatitude θ changes. When Ste is ﬁxed, For each value
of Pe, the errors increase as the colatitude θ approaches π/2. Also, for any ﬁxed
value of θ, the errors are a decreasing function of Pe. Again, for any ﬁxed value
of Ste, the errors increase monotonically as θ → π/2, and for any ﬁxed value
of θ, the errors increase with increasing Ste. The third column for both tables
correspond to the non-dimensional group pair Ste = 0.5 and Pe = 10. These
values for Ste and Pe are very close to the speciﬁc example worked out in detail
in [2]. In fact, if we assume that the sphere resembles a small rock penetrator
of radius 3 cm melting its way through a typical rock like basalt, the relevant
physical properties lead to Ste = 0.556 and Pe = 10.33. For values of Ste and
Pe in a range where our analysis makes sense, the inequality δM < δET < δET0
always holds and the separation between δM and δET increases as the equator
is approached (θ = π/2).

Integral Balance Method: Two-Layer Model

The boundary condition ∂T/∂y = −(Pe/Ste) cos θ at y = δ implies that the
gradient of the temperature is zero at the equator. This condition is inconsistent
with the temperature at this point being Tm while the surrounding solid medium
has a temperate T∞ . An improved boundary condition at this melt/solid interface, based on the requirement that the latent heat required to melt the solid
must be supplied by conduction, is ∂T/∂y = −(Pe/σ) cos θ + β(∂T /∂y), where
β = ks (Tm − T∞ )/kl (T0 − Tm ), and σ = cp (T0 − Tm )/L is similar to Ste but
based on the actual latent heat, T = (Ts −T∞ )/(Tm −T∞ ) is the non-dimensional
temperature in the thermal-layer, and ks and kl represent the thermal conductivities for solid and liquid (melt) respectively. The geometry for the two-layer
model is shown in Figure 1. If ε(θ) is the non-dimensional thermal layer thickness, the integral balance method described in section 2 can be applied to the
thermal layer to obtain a series approximation for ε(θ), and T (y) is then computed by direct substitution. Finally, the resulting expression for T (y) is used
in the boundary condition above and the integral balance method applied to the
melt-layer to obtain its thickness, δ2L (θ). The salient diﬀerences between δ2L
and δET computed using u(δ) = 0 are outlined in [2]. The melt-layer thickness,
δET becomes inﬁnite, leading to a physically unrealistic unbounded melt region
while δ2L (π/2) = 0.1325, leading to a ﬁnite melt region.
Using the improved boundary condition u(y) = − sin(θ) to determine the
velocity u(y) in conjunction with the two-layer approach leads to a further improvement in the estimate of the melt-layer thickness. If δ2M (θ) denotes the
melt-layer thickness using this modiﬁed two-layer approach, then the relations
δ2M < δ2L < δM < δET < δET0 hold among the diﬀerent melt-layer expressions.
Using the same values for σ, Ste, Pe, and β, yields δ2M (π/2) = 0.1306. If the
radius of the sphere is reduced, σ, Ste, and Pe increase while β decreases. The
relative percentage errors, 100 × |δ2M (θ) − δ2L (θ)|/|δ2L (θ)| range between 0.07
and 1.46 for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.
