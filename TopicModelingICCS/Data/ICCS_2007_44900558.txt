Abstract. This paper presents an efficient rough set based anomaly detection
method that can effectively identify a group of especially harmful internal attackers – masqueraders in cellular mobile networks. Our scheme uses the trace
data of wireless application layer by a user as feature value. Based on this, the
use pattern of a mobile’s user can be captured by rough sets, and the abnormal
behavior of the mobile can be also detected effectively by applying a roughness
membership function with the age of the user profile.

1 Introduction
The nature of mobile computing environment makes it very vulnerable to an adversary’s malicious attacks. The use of wireless links renders the network susceptible to
attacks ranging from passive eavesdropping to active interfering. Unlike wired networks where an adversary must gain physical access to the network wires or pass
through several lines of defenses at firewalls and gateways, attacks on a wireless
network can come from all directions and target at any node [1]. In this paper, we
propose the intrusion detection technique that the normal profile of each mobile is
constructed by using rough sets and anomaly activities are effectively detected by
using a rough membership function with the age of user profile. When an intrusion
occurs, the attacker masquerading the legitimate user trends to have a different use
pattern. Therefore, we can detect anomaly by comparing the use patterns. Therefore,
we can detect anomaly by comparing the use pattern.

The number of intrusions into computer system is growing because new automated
intrusion tools are appearing every day. Although there are many authentication protocols in cellular mobile networks, security is still a very challenging task due to the
open radio transmission environment and the physical vulnerability of mobile devices.

user as the feature value [2]. In [3], based on fuzzy view of rough sets instead of exact
rules, a soft computing approach that uses fuzzy rules for anomaly detection is proposed. Bae, I. H. proposed a rough set based anomaly detection scheme without considering the age of user profiles [4].

3 Rough Set
Let U be a finite set of objects called Universe, and R⊆U×U be an equivalence relation on U. The pair A=(U, R) is called approximation space, and equivalence classes
of the relation R are called elementary sets in A.
For x∈U, let [x]R denote the equivalence class of R, containing x. For each X⊆U,
X is characterized in A by a pair of sets – its lower and upper approximation in A,
defined as:
AX = {x ∈ U | [ x ]R ⊆ X }
AX = {x ∈ U | [ x ]R ∩ X ≠ ∅}

The objects in AX can be with certainty classified as members of X on the basis of
knowledge in R, while the objects in AX can be only classified as possible members
of X on the basis of knowledge in A. The set BN A X = AX − AX is called the Aboundary region of X, and thus consists of those objects that we cannot decisively
classify into X on the basis of knowledge in A.
Rough set can be also characterized numerically by the following coefficient called
the accuracy of approximation, where Card denotes the cardinality [5].

4 Anomaly Detection Considering the Age of User Profiles
In this section, we introduce the construction of a rough set based anomaly detection
scheme that considers the age of user profiles. For each mobile user, the features of
the user activities from the wireless application layer are captured. We use the traveled cell ID, the duration of the service and the service class of a user as the feature
value. The feature values are stored in the user’s feature profile database.
The equivalence classes from the user’s feature profile database are computed by
using rough sets. For a mobile user, based on both the user activity information and
the equivalence class information, a deviation number is computed by a roughness
membership function with the age of the user profile, where the deviation number
represents the degree that the user behavior is deviated from the normal behavior.
When a user activity occurs, if the deviation number is greater than the deviation
threshold that is a system parameter, an alert message occurs, otherwise the user activity identified as normal. The whole scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The user feature profile database used in our scheme is shown in Table 1, where
REQ#, CELL, DUR, CLASS and AGE represent the service request number, the
traveled cell ID, the requested service duration, the requested service class and the age

newer. The profile data are continuously come and faded (aging) away.

The fuzzy inclusions are represented by the inequalities of membership functions.
Further, we will allow certain errors as long as they are within the radius of tolerance.
The fuzzy inclusion is computed by Eq. (1), roughness membership function.

where g represents the number of age grades, wage represents the weighted value of
the age, and X and Y represent condition attribute and decision attribute, respectively.
We assume that the deviation threshold (ε) is 0.58. In case that a user activity (c, 2,
α) is occurred, let X={c, 2} and Y={α}, RX = {3, 4,5, 6,8,9,10,14,15} and

RY = {1, 2,3,11,12,13} , so that μ ( X , Y ) = 8.4 /14 = 0.6 . Accordingly, the user activity
is identified as anomalous because that μ ( X , Y ) > ε , and an alert message is generated.

5 Performance Evaluation
We use the following two metrics: detection rate, false alarm rate to evaluate the performance
of our proposed anomaly detection scheme.

We present and analyze the simulation results at different deviation threshold. We
assume as follows. In cases of age 1 and age 2, if a user activity had two records those
the two values of the user activity attribute values were matched with the feature values of the user profile data, the user activity is normal. Also, if a user activity had one
record that two values of the user activity attribute values were matched with the feature values of age 1 within the user profile data and one or more records those two
values of the user activity attributes values were matched with the feature values of age
2 or age 3 within the user profile data, the user activity is normal. All user activities of
other cases are abnormal. Table 2 shows the parameter values for the simulation.

The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that of a rough set
based anomaly detection scheme without aging [4]. Simulation results of the detection
rate and the false alarm rate over deviation threshold are illustrated in Fig. 2. The
detection rate of our scheme (Detection (age)) is better than that of the rough set
based anomaly detection scheme without aging (Detection (no age)) regardless of
deviation thresholds.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose the intrusion detection technique that the normal profile of
each mobile is constructed by using rough sets and anomaly activities are effectively
detected by using a rough membership function with the age of user profile. From the
results, we know that the performance of our scheme is better than that of the rough
set based anomaly detection scheme without aging regardless of deviation thresholds.
