Abstract. The procedure for the calculation of heat conduction process in
constructions elements with thin protective multilayer coatings is elaborated.
This procedure is based on the essential simplification of solving the initial
problem for constructions elements with thin multilayer coatings, and is
connected with the modeling of such coatings by thin shells with appropriate
geometrical and thermal properties of a coating. In such an approach, the
influence of thin coatings on the course of heat processes in a body-coating
system is described by special generalized boundary conditions. The efficiency
of this approach has been shown by the comparison of results obtained
according to this approximate approach with an accurate solution for the test
case of an n-layer plate.

1. Introduction
The bodies with multilayer thin coatings represent an important class of nonhomogeneous bodies. In practice to protect construction elements from the aggressive
influence of environment, special coatings are used. It is essential that such coatings
usually have non-homogeneous properties (which is connected with production
conditions or caused by functional requirements) – multilayer coatings, in particular.
Several authors have investigated different heat conduction problems for these
objects [2, 12, 13]. Usually such calculation for bodies with composite coatings is
connected with formulating and solving appropriate problems of mathematical
physics for multilayer systems, which are cumbersome and ineffective for practical
purposes and are usually used as standards in elaborating approximate methods. It is
natural, therefore, to attempt to build up approximate solutions, which are
satisfactorily accurate for practical purposes. There have been suggested various
approaches [2, 9, 10, 13] that allow us to take into account the specific feature of such
systems – the smallness of coating thickness in comparison with that of a substrate –
during the calculation of heat processes in the bodies with coatings. One of effective
approaches consists in modeling of the influence of thin-walled elements of
constructions by special boundary conditions [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11]. This approach
essentially simplifies solving the problems of finding the thermal state of

constructions with thin multilayer coatings. It is based on the modeling of the coatings
by thin shells with appropriate geometrical and thermal properties of a coating.
The elaboration of such generalized boundary conditions can be derived by
different techniques. Depending on the type of boundary conditions, the kinds of
considered non-linearities and the possibility of preliminary linearization, the
following methods can be used:
(i) operator method, which allows us not to accept preliminary hypotheses of the
distribution of desired functions over the thickness of coating layers [5, 8];
(ii) approach, based on the application of a priori assumptions of the distribution
of desired functions over the thickness of coating layers or on the whole coating [7];
(iii) discrete approach, based on the appropriate difference approximations of normal
derivatives in appropriate expansions [3].
In this article, the generalized boundary condition is constructed by the application
of operator method, and the efficiency of the approach is illustrated by the example of
the solution of a test problem.

2. Problem Statement

Fig. 1. Scheme of object

The object under investigation is a body with an applied thin multilayer coating with
n

thickness δ = ∑ δ i , whose layers are made of different orthotropic materials. Here
i =1

the n-layer coating is considered as a thin shell, referred to a mixed coordinate system
(α, β, γ ), which are respectively the lines of principal curvatures of the body-coating
interface and the normal to it (Fig. 1). We assume that the edge surface Σ of such a
shell is a ruled surface, for which the contour G bounding the body-coating interface S
is directrix, and the normal to S in every point of the contour is generatrix.
We write the heat conduction equation for the each thin ith layer as [8]

and initial conditions are

i = 1, n .

( 5)

Here ti , t b , t e are the temperatures of the ith coating layer, the body and the
environment respectively; Ai, Bi are the coefficients of the first fundamental form of
the interface between ith and (i-1)th layers ( i = 2, n ) and of the interface of bodycoating (i = 1); k1i, k2i are the curvatures of coordinate lines; δi is the thickness of the

ith layer;

λαi , λβi , λγi , and ωi are the coefficients of heat conductivity and heat

capacity; µ , µ i are the coefficients of heat output from coating surface γ = γ n and
from ith part of the edge surface Σ ; n1 , n2 are the components of vector of outer
normal to the edge surface Σ . The subscripts i, b, and e refer to the ith layer of the
coating, the body, and the environment respectively.

3. Derivation of Generalized Boundary Conditions
Instead of temperature ti we introduce variable [5, 8]
θ i = exp( k i γ )t i

i = 1, n .

For its determination, we obtain the equation

Let us introduce notations for the boundary values of the function θ i and its

Using the operator method [5, 8], we represent the general solution of Eq. (7) as
the solution of an ordinary differential equation
θi =

θi− sin( pi ( γ i − γ )) + θ i+ sin( pi ( γ − γ i −1 ))
,
sin( pi δ i )

i = 1,n .

(14)

Substituting (14) into (10)-(12), we obtain the following recursive relations for the
temperature and its derivative at the interfaces of neighboring layers

From (16), (15) follows:

Since relations (19), (25), (26) establish the connection between the boundary
 ∂t 
value of body temperature tb and its derivative   with given value of
 ∂γ  b

conditions which take into account the influence of the multilayer coating on the
course of heat process in a body.

4. Calculation Variants of Generalized Boundary Conditions
For sufficiently thin coatings, conditions (19), (25), (26) can be simplified by
expanding their terms in the series of powers of small δ i and neglecting the terms

For the cases when the shell that models the coating is closed, conditions (27)-(28)
coincide with the ones, which have been obtained in [11]. Such modeling is also
possible when the influence of the edge surface can be neglected due to its small
value in the whole heat transfer.

5. Restoration Formulas
After determining the temperature field in a body based on solving the appropriate
boundary value problem with generalized boundary conditions, we can find
temperature over the thickness of a coating by restoration formulas.
These formulas can be obtained by substitution of change (6) to (14) using (16),
(11), and (12). In a general case, they have the form

obtained according to the above approximate approach with the solution of a test onedimension problem of non-stationary heat conduction when heating the plate with

The exact solution of this problem is given in [14]. The approximate solution of the
problem on the basis of the above formulated approach is based on the solution of
equation (31) in the body domain under the initial condition (32), the boundary

This approximate solution is compared with exact solution according [14] for
certain time moments for the four-layer plate characterized by the following values of
geometrical and physical parameters: δ1 = δ 2 = 0.5δ 3 = 5 ⋅ 10 −5 m , h = 2 ⋅ 10 −2 m ,
λ1 = 2 W / m ⋅ 0 C ,

λ 2 = 4W / m ⋅ 0 C ,

a 2 = 6.4 ⋅ 10 −6 m 2 /S ,

λ 3 = 6W / m ⋅ 0 C ,
a 3 = 8 ⋅ 10 −6 m 2 /S ,

λ b = 4W / m ⋅ 0 C ,
a b = 1.2 ⋅ 10−5 m 2 /S ,

The analysis of the indicated results obtained for certain time moments (Table 1)
shows that the values of temperatures of exact (lower values in the lines) and
approximate (upper values in the lines) solutions do not differ essentially.

7. Concluding Remarks
These generalized boundary conditions may be used for an analytical solution (when
it is possible) as well as for a numerical one. Since the application of direct numerical
methods without the preliminary transformation of initial problems for massive
bodies with thin coatings may be impeded (because of the essential difference
between geometrical and thermal characteristics of the coating and the base), one may
expect the efficiency of application of approaches based on the use of generalized
boundary conditions in the investigation of thermal state of the constructions, which
include thin-walled and massive elements.
