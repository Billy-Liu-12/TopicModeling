Abstract. In this paper we investigate the users’ recommendation networks based on the large data set from the Internet Movie Database. We
study networks based on two types of inputs: ﬁrst (monopartite) generated directly from the recommendation lists on the website, and second
(bipartite) generated through the users’ habits. Using a threshold number of votes per movie to ﬁlter the data, we actually introduce a control
parameter, and then by tuning this parameter we study its eﬀect on
the network structure. From the detailed analysis of both networks we
ﬁnd that certain robust topological features occur independently from
the value of the control parameter. We also present a comparison of the
network clustering and shortest paths on the graphs with a randomized
network model based on the same data.
Keywords: recommendation networks, bipartite graphs, topology.

Introduction

Social networks, representing interactions and relationships between humans or
groups, recently became subject of broad research interest [1]. One of the reasons behind this is rapidly evolving electronic technology, which created e-social
networks, representing social communication through the Internet. They can be
seen as social networks or a technological communication networks [2]. E-mail,
chats, web portals, etc., gave us huge amount of information needed for investigated social structures, but also adds new dimension to the social structures.
In contrast to the typical communication between pairs of users on the network,
such as e-mail network, where a message is sent directly to one known user [3],
we can also investigate social structures where users comunicate through common interests, like books, musics, movies, etc. In these user-based dynamical
systems subtle correlations between users are developed through hidden feedback mechanisms, in which users share currently available opinions and make
actions which, in turn, contribute to further evolution of the network.
Recommendation systems help to overcome information overload by providing
personalized suggestions. On many Internet portals, when user selects a product a certain number of alternative products are suggested. These products are
nodes of a recommendation network and links point toward the products in their

retrospective recommendation lists. For example, networks where products are
music groups is studied in Ref. [6]. Recommendations can be generated either
through collaborative ﬁltering or using content-based methods or by combination
of these two methods. If collaborative ﬁltering is used, the generated network,
are actually one-mode projections of bipartite networks, where one type of nodes
are products and the other type are users. Links go only between nodes of different types, in this case link is created if the user select the product. Another
example connect users with music groups they collected in their music sharing liberties [4,7]. The loss of information in transition from bipartite network to
one-mode projection is obvious. In Ref. [5] authors discused the way of obtaining
one-mode projection with minimal loss of information and tested their method
on the movies-users network.
Here we examined movies-users network using the data from the largest and
the most comprehensive on-line movies database IMDb [8]. Generated networks
were based on the data on more than 43, 000 movies and 350, 000 users. Furthermore, we introduced a control parameter and tested the universality of our
conclusions for the networks of diﬀerent sizes. We combine two approaches. As
a starting point we perform an analysis of the empirical data collected from
the website IMDb. Then we investigate the properties of naturally emerging
bipartite network based on the users’ behavior.

Movie Networks

Investigated database IMDb has numerous information regarding more that
1,000,000 ﬁlms, TV series and shows, direct-to-video product and video games.

The database also posses the user comment, ratings and message boards which
characterize users habits. For each movie we collect the following information:
ID-number, number of votes V , ID numbers of movies in their recommendation
list and ID-numbers of users which commented that movie. Collected information belong to two types of data. First type are IMDb recommendations based on
the recommendation system of the site. Second are users’ habits, through which,
using collaborative ﬁltering, we generate our own recommendation networks. For
computational purposes, we concentrated our research only on USA theatrically
released movies. This choice was also motivated by the fact that USA theatrical
releases had the most comprehensive data.
In order to analyze the universality of our conclusions, we introduced number
of votes as control parameter. Users have the opportunity to give their rating
for any movie in the Database. Number of votes varies from movie to movie,
with more popular ones having more votes. The largest network we analyzed
has movies with more that 10 votes and it consists of more that 43, 000 movies
and 300, 000 users. We investigated ﬁve diﬀerent sizes of networks according to
the minimal number of votes casted for movies Vmin ∈ {101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 }.
As presumed, number of movies quickly decreases when minimal number of votes
increases. Vmin 1. On the other hand, number of users does not drastically change
when Vmin is increased, which is also expected: if a small number of people voted
for some movie than also small number of users commented the movie and by
cutting-oﬀ huge number of less popular movies you do not cut-oﬀ many users.
Users usually commented on more than one movie, so by cutting-oﬀ some movie
you do not necessarily cut-oﬀ the user as well. From gathered information we
constructed three diﬀerent networks:
IMDb recommendations (IMDb) monopartite directed network is made by
using recommendation system provided by the website [8]. Nodes are movies and
links are pointing towards the movies in their respective recommendation list.
Rules for generating this recommendation lists is not publicly available (due to
the IMDb privacy policy). It is only known that it uses factors such as user votes,
genre, title, keywords, and, most importantly, user recommendations themselves
to generate an automatic response.
User driven bipartite network (UD-BP) is constructed using users’ comments.
One type of nodes are movies, and the other type of nodes are users. The movie
and the user are linked if a speciﬁc user left a comment on the webpage on a
speciﬁc movie. We do not distinguish between positive and negative comments.
As before, we made large bipartite network of almost 43, 000 movies and almost
400, 000 users. Average number of users per movie was 27 with maximum number
of 4, 763 comment left for the movie “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of
the Ring”. Average number of movies per user is much smaller (around three),
but the maximal number was 3, 040.
One-mode projection of user driven network (UD-OM) is generated from previous bipartite network. For each movie we generate recommendation list similar
to the list provided by the website, but this time based on the users’ comments.
Like in usual one-mode projection, two movies will be connected if they have

Movies Recommendation Networks as Bipartite Graphs

a user which left comment on both movies, but in the recommendation list we
put only ten movies with the highest numbers of common users. Among movies
with the same number of common users, we choose randomly. We note that this
network will also be directed: despite having common users being symmetric
relation, if movie i is in the top ten movies of movie j, that does not imply that
the movie j is in the top ten movies of movie i.
Users-preferential random network (UP-RD) is generated by connecting each
movie to ten other movies randomly from probability distribution proportional
to the number of users which left comment on that movie. This way we expect to
obtain the degree distribution similar to the distribution of number of users per
movie. However since linked movies are chosen randomly, not by their similarity,
we expect this to create signiﬁcant diﬀerences in other properties of such network.
Test if networks’ properties are just the consequence of favoring more popular
movies in recommendation system or there is some other underlying mechanism
which actually connect movies with movies of their kind.

Investigated Properties

In order to determine topology of the network, we focus on the properties which
we consider as most importante for the network searchability. Observed properties could lead to possible optimizations of movies recommendation system.
Investigated properties are similar to those already studied for real networks:
Degree ki of the node i is the number of links incident to that node. Average degree k is ki averaged over all nodes [1]. The degree distribution P (k) is
probability that a node selected uniformly at random has degree k. For directed
network we can calculate in-degree distribution P (k in ) as distribution of incoming links and out -degree distribution P (k out ) as distribution of outgoing links.
Since the number of outgoing links is limited to 10, only degree of incoming links
in nontrivial, so we present only those results. In bipartite network we calculate
degree distribution for each type of nodes separately.
Clustering coeﬃcient introduced in Ref. [10] expresses how likely is for the
two ﬁrst neighbors j and k of the node i to be connected. Clustering coeﬃcient
ci of the node i is the ratio between the total number ei of links between its
nearest neighbors and the total number of all possible links between these nearest
neighbors:
2ei
(1)
ci =
ki (ki − 1).
Clustering coeﬃcient for the whole network c is average of Ci over all nodes.
In directed monopartite networks we did not distinguish between the directions
of the links. In bipartite networks there are two types of nodes and links go only
between diﬀerent types, so the above deﬁnition for clustering does not apply
because triangle does not exist.
A measure of the typical separation between two nodes in the graph is given
by the average shortest path length D, deﬁned as the mean of all shortest paths
lengths dij [10]. A problem with this deﬁnition is that D diverges if network

Results and Discusion

A common feature which appears in all studied networks is a degree distribution
with power law tail. Even more important is the fact that the degree distributions
are universal for networks of diﬀerent sizes, obtained by changing the control
parameter. This suggests that even though we studied large but limited number
of movies, our main result do not depend on the number of movies, i.e. on ﬁnite
size eﬀect.
For user driven bipartite network, the distribution of number of movies per
user is very robust power-law, universal for all sizes of networks. The distribution
ﬁts to the power law with the exponent 2.16. This exponet occurs in most of the
studied real world networks [1]. The distribution of number of users per movie
(Fig 3) is well described by a power law for the largest investigated networks
(Vmin > 10), for the smaller networks this is not the case, as the number of
movies per user decreases below 20. This is expected since in smaller networks
we do not have less popular movies, and those are the movies which usually have
small number of users.
Even though IMDb recommendations network has degree distributions which
are not power laws for the degrees less than 11, the distributions can be rescaled
so as to ﬁt to the same curve even for the small degrees. Like their bipartite

counterparts, one-mode projections have the power-law degree distributions
through the whole range of degrees (Fig 2). Exponent of the power law is close
to the exponent of the distribution of the number of users per movie. We emphasize that we did not performe separate one-mode projection of network of
diﬀerent sizes. Rather, we constructed one-mode projection for the largest network and then constructed smaller networks by eliminating movies with less that
Vmin votes and all of their links from the largest network. All distributions are
logarithmically binned in order to decrease the noise.
Both networks based on the real data show small world property. Clustering
coeﬃcients are high and are increasing when size of the network decreases. Since
smaller networks are missing less popular movies, more popular movies networks
are more clustered. Average path lengths are small and decreasing with the size
of the network. Topological eﬃciency is increasing for smaller networks (Fig 4).
As expected, the degree distribution of the users-preferential random network
is a power-law with the similar exponent as IMDb and UD-OM networks. But
apart from the degree distribution, other properties of are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
Most obvious diﬀerence is in the clustering coeﬃcient. As expected, random networks have the clustering coeﬃcient few orders of magnitude smaller than those
of the real networks. Average shorthest paths are signiﬁcantly smaller although
they exhibit similar behavior. Also, we see that the eﬃciencies are proportionally larger. We note that some properties of IMDb network are closer to the
ones of UP-RD networks. Power-law degree distribution of UD-OM could be a
consequence of the preferential attachment to more popular movies. During construction of the network we connected movies with more common users. Movies
with more users would also have greater probability to have more common users
with some other movie. However, we see that if we connect movies only by favoring more popular movies, other properties would be diﬀerent. Smallest network
with Vmin = 105 is so sparse that we eliminated it from the investigation.

Conclusion and Future Directions

Using the data from the largest and most comprehensive movie database IMDb,
we considered two types of networks: one based on the IMDb recommendations
and one based on collaborative ﬁltering based on user habits. As a starting point
we investigated properties of movies directed network following directly from
IMDb recommendations data. We generated bipartite networks by connecting
users with the movies they commented on. In order to compare these two approaches, we made one-mode projection of bipartite networks. We introduced
the minimal number of votes as a control parameter and constructed diﬀerent
sizes of networks according to the number of votes of movies. All networks show
high clustering coeﬃcients and small world property, although some variations
are noticed in the behavior for diﬀerent sizes of networks. Degree distributions
for both types of networks are universal. Networks obtained through collaborative ﬁltering exhibits robust power-low distributions seemingly universal for
all sizes of networks. Networks based on IMDb recommendations although not
power law distributions for small values of degrees, still have power-law tail.
Since the properties of random vote-preferential networks, most noticeably clustering coeﬃcient are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from one-mode projection, we believe

Movies Recommendation Networks as Bipartite Graphs

that the power-low distribution is not just the consequence of the favoring more
popular movies, but some self-organizing mechanism.
In the future, we plan to generalize the presented approach. By investigating
the community structures, users clustering and by further theoretical modeling,
we are going to try to understand natural mechanisms behind these properties.
