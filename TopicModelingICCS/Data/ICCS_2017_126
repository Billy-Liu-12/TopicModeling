can change directions almost instantly, driven by changing environmental conditions. Effective
response to such events requires the ability to monitor and predict the behavior of the fire as
fast as they change.
WIFIRE [3, 29] builds an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for real-time and data-driven simulation, prediction, and visualization of wildfire behavior. One goal of WIFIRE is to provide
the tools to predict a more accurate rate of a spreading wildfire. To this end, WIFIRE has developed interfaces for ingesting and visualizing high-density sensor networks to improve fire and
weather predictions, and has created a data model for wildfire resources including sensed and
archived data, sensors, satellites, cameras, modeling tools, workflows, and social information
including Twitter feeds for wildfire research and response.
In order to make these geospatial data and products accessible, WIFIRE developed geospatial workflows enabled in a web browser platform called Firemap [31] using the Kepler Scientific
Workflow System [25, 2]. Using GIS capabilities combined with scalable big data integration
and processing, Firemap enables simple execution of the model with options for running ensembles by taking the information uncertainty into account. The results are easily viewable,
sharable, repeatable, and can be animated as a time series.
Firemap provides a simplified, yet scalable and extensible mapping and visualization platform for wildfire information dissemination and near real-time predictive fire behavior modeling,
making the WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure useful to their partners in city, county, and state fire
agencies who are using these tools for daily operations.
This paper presents the Firemap architecture and its main components for geospatial data
services, predictive fire modeling and web-based visualization. We believe that Firemap is
the first extensible tool that provides system integration of diverse fire datasets (ranging from
ground-based sensors, mountain-top cameras, satellites, and public databases for land management) and makes them integrated into predictive fire modeling in a near real-time fashion.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of related work
and comparisons to Firemap. Section 3 describes the Firemap architecture, which includes the
Firemap interactive web application and Pylaski, GeoServer, Kepler WebView, and LiveWx
data services. Section 4 concludes the paper and presents some of our future work plans.

Related Work

The AEGIS wildfire management information system is most similar to Firemap in that it
deploys a web-based GIS to ingest data and predict fire behavior in real-time [10]. Firemap
differs in its ability to run ensembles of fire propagation with multiple options for editing the
weather inputs: either manually, using time-stepped weather forecast, or constant weather
conditions from the nearest weather station. Firemap also allows for ingesting a data service
for real-time reports of updated fire ignitions or perimeters that can be used to update the fire
modeling.
The PHOENIX RapidFire model is used to show the likelihood of the fire spread under different weather and fire suppression scenarios using propagation equations that best approximate
fire behavior in Australia [30]. It is capable of being run and rerun in minutes with updated
information as it is available. Unlike Firemap, PHOENIX RapidFire is not web-enabled and
does not currently have mechanisms for running ensembles.
FlamMap computes fire behavior characteristics spatially for constant environmental conditions. Instead of depicting fire spread over time, it provides a comparison of fire potential
fire behavior over the landscape and can be used for determining best fuel treatment scenarios [8]. FARSITE is a desktop application used most widely for training and for operations

during large wildfire events by fire agencies across the US including CAL FIRE and US Forest
Service [6] . It uses a semi-empirical model to calculate fire growth in deterministic simplified
test conditions, incorporating existing fire behavior formulas of surface fire spread, crown fire
spread, spotting, point source fire acceleration, and fuel moisture. The model produces 2D
vector fire perimeters at specified time intervals [7]. FARSITE can help analysts determine the
rate and direction of spread of a particular fire and predict when it will reach a given location.
The vector propagation technique allows the model to be adaptive to changes in wind speed
and direction. Although input files required to run FARSITE are available for free download
from publicly available websites (National Weather Service, USGS, LANDFIRE, MesoWest),
the formatting and ingestion of those data to FARSITE is cumbersome, and does not ingest
real-time data.
The Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) is a web-based fire management
decision support platform used for large fires across the United States [18]. Access is given only
to approved and trained fire responders. There are many components to WFDSS for the decision
support of the fire incident including the fire analysis modules. The Basic Fire Behavior model
is a version of FlamMap, the Short-Term Fire Behavior calculates the minimum travel time of
a fire, and the Near-Term Fire Behavior is a version of FARSITE. FSPro is a program created
by the US Forest Service that calculates the spatial probability of fire spread using uncertainty
in the weather. It is used to determine a fire’s growth potential from an active fire perimeter,
to determine priorities for firefighting resources [16]. It generates hundreds of potential wind
and weather scenarios (based on the current season’s weather as well as historic weather) and
incorporates this information in simulating thousands of individual fires. Although the results
of FSPro runs can be improved with weather sensors that are in better locations and more
densely distributed, FSPro is a probability tool, and uses a large historic dataset to create
those probabilities. Due to this, FSPro is not useful for ingesting real-time weather data.
SCOUT (previously National Incident Command System) was developed by the MIT Lincoln
Laboratory and is now managed by the California Office of Emergency Services (CalOES)
[20]. It is a field incident management system for any disaster response scenario, including
wildfires. Although users can manage incident information, there are no simulation modules
within it. Once calculated outside of SCOUT, managers can add tactical decisions from their
modeling into it. Users can view current weather conditions with other conditions including
road conditions, utilities, census information, known hazards, and government boundaries. It
is not a system designed to ingest real-time environmental data for analysis.

Architecture

The WIFIRE architecture is shown in Figure 1. An interactive map application called Firemap
runs in clients’ web browsers and communicates with four services: Pylaski, GeoServer, Kepler
WebView, and LiveWx. The rest of this section describes each of these components.

3.1

Firemap

The Firemap user interface, or Firemap, is an interactive graphical application that allows
users to perform predictive wildfire modeling and visualize WIFIRE geospatial datasets. The
primary interface is a tiled web map that users can zoom and pan in the web browser. WIFIRE
datasets are visualized as a set of layers that can individually be added to or removed from
the map. A layer’s transparency can also be changed allowing better insights of spatially
overlapping datasets. Figure 2 shows several example layers: (a) the Weather Stations Layer

detections of the Rey Fire, (c) the Historical Fires Layer showing past wildfires in San Diego
County, and (d) the Surface Fuels Layer showing the vegetation fuels northwest of Los Angeles.
The WIFIRE services and data sources implementing these layers are discussed in Sections
3.2-3.5.
Firemap contains several interactive components to perform predictive wildfire modeling.
A user first draws the initial fire perimeter on the map, and then specifies the weather conditions and simulation time using the configuration dialog shown in Figure 3 (a). The weather
parameters for air temperature, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity can be adjusted manually allowing the user to investigate “what-if” scenarios. The weather can also be
set based on Santa Ana conditions, current or historical observations nearest the initial fire
perimeter, or the weather forecast. Firemap queries Pylaski for the latter two scenarios.
When the Run button is pressed, Firemap sends the configuration parameters to Kepler
WebView, which runs the fire model. After the simulation finishes, Kepler WebView sends the
fire growth perimeters to Firemap, which are then visualized in a new layer added to the map
as shown in Figure 3 (b). The estimated time of arrival, or ETA, shown next to the perimeters
on the map denotes the fire arrival times. Additionally, the weather conditions used for the
simulation, and area burned by the fire can be displayed. The input parameters and resulting
fire perimeters can be saved and shared between users. Section 3.4 describes the workflows to
run the fire model, and save and share the results.

3.2

Pylaski

Pylaski is a REST service providing uniform access across different data sources and types
as shown in Figure 4. When a request arrives at Pylaski, the appropriate data sources are
queried based on the parameters in the request. Many data sources are external to the WIFIRE
architecture and accessible via a REST service. Since each data source (both local and external)
has a unique set of query parameters, Pylaski translates the query parameters from the client
into the query parameters for each data source. Additionally, the data returned from different
sources have different schema and possibly different formats, e.g., JSON and XML. Pylaski
integrates all the results from different sources into a unified GeoJSON schema that is returned
to the client.

Historical Fires layer showing wildfires in San Diego County during 1970-2015; and (d) Surface
Fuels Layer showing the vegetation fuels for the canyons northwest of Los Angeles in 2014.
Since the datasets accessible by Pylaski are very large, the REST query parameters primarily
limit the data spatially, temporally, by type, or by some combination of these. Spatial queries
find the measurements nearest to a specific set of latitude and longitude coordinates, or retrieve
measurements taken within a bounding box. Data can also be filtered temporally by requesting
the latest data or archived data within a specific time frame. Finally, the data to retrieve can
be limited to a specified set of types, e.g., to run the wildfire model, we can limit the results to
air temperature, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity.
The following describes the data sources provided by Pylaski and how they are used in
Firemap:
• Weather stations: MesoWest and Synoptics Labs [13] provide observations of over 30,000
weather stations primarily located throughout North America. The Weather Stations
Layer shows the locations and latest measurements from these stations as shown in Figure
2 (a). Additionally, these stations can provide the wildfire model with the current or
historical weather conditions at the station nearest the initial fire perimeter.
• Weather forecast: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) weather forecast has a
horizontal spatial resolution of 3km and temporal resolution of 15 minutes. HRRR re5

temporal resolution enhances the accuracy of the wildfire model prediction based on the
forecasted weather.
• Camera images: The High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN) [9] and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) [28] operate tower-mounted cameras throughout San Diego County. The cameras are mostly located on mountaintops,
which provide ideal viewpoints for locating wildfires in the backcountry. AlertTahoe [21]
operates tower-mounted cameras around Lake Tahoe and throughout Nevada. Most of
these cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ), which can be changed to focus on a wildfire. The
Camera Layer shows the location and images from these cameras.
• Air Quality Stations: OpenAQ [27] aggregates air quality data from over 40 countries.
The Air Quality Layer shows the location and latest measurements from these stations.

GeoServer

Firemap uses GeoServer [23], an open-source server for accessing geospatial datasets, to display GIS data. GeoServer implements a number of open standards from the Open Geospatial

[14] with 375m and 1km resolution, respectively. Both satellites fly over the same area
approximately twice a day. The detections are downloaded from NASA and ingested to
the PostGIS database every hour. Figure 2 (b) shows seven days of VIIRS detections of
the Rey Fire.
• Smoke Areas: smoke plumes indicating possible wildfire locations. The smoke data is retrieved from NOAA’s Hazard Mapping System [15] and ingested to the PostGIS database
every hour.
• Red Flag Areas: regions currently experiencing weather conditions that “may result in
extreme burning conditions” [19] such as high wind speeds and low relative humidity. The
Red Flag warnings are downloaded from the National Wildfire Coordinating Group [26]
and ingested to the PostGIS database every hour.
• Census Blocks: number of people and housing units from the 2010 U.S. Census. The
number of people in a neighborhood threatened by a wildfire is crucial when determining
evacuation times. Firemap provides both a graphical layer showing census blocks and the
ability to query census information for user-drawn areas.
• Surface Fuels: classification of surface vegetation into thirteen fire behavior fuel models
[1, 4] from LANDFIRE [11]. Surface fuels are a critical input parameter for fire modeling
and Firemap provides a layer to visualize this data as shown in Figure 2 (d).
• Canopy Cover: percentage of forest floor covered by trees from LANDFIRE [12]. The
canopy cover is used to model crown fires, i.e., fires that spread in the top layer of tree
foliage.
• Camera Viewsheds: geographical areas with line-of-sight visibility surrounding the HPWREN and AlertTahoe cameras. The Camera Viewsheds Layer visualizes the regions
visible and not visible by the cameras.

Kepler WebView

Kepler WebView [5] integrates web technologies with the Kepler Scientific Workflow System [2].
A lightweight web server runs inside the Kepler process and provides real-time communication
between clients and Kepler workflows. A client can use either REST or WebSockets to execute
workflows, and data is exchanged as JSON.
Kepler workflows are composed of a set of executable components, called actors, linked
together to form an overall execution plan. Each actor has one or more input and output ports
from which they can be connected to other actors thereby creating data dependencies. Actors
may also have a set of parameters to configure their execution. Kepler workflows also contain
directors, which specify the execution semantics such as the model of computation and how
actors communicate with each other.
A Kepler workflow has been created to run the FARSITE fire growth simulator [7]. The
inputs include the weather conditions, simulation time, and initial fire perimeters. The workflow
creates the FARSITE configuration files based on these parameters, and executes FARSITE.
After FARSITE completes the simulation, Kepler WebView sends the resulting fire perimeters
back to the client browser, which are then added as a new layer in Firemap. FARSITE writes
the fire growth perimeters to an ESRI Shapefile, and Kepler WebView automatically converts
this to GeoJSON when sending the results to Firemap.
Fire perimeters generated by a single FARSITE execution, or fire run, may be shared between users and downloaded as KML or Shapefiles. This functionality is implemented in several
Kepler workflows, which employ GIS actors to convert between geospatial data formats and projections, and SQL actors to query and update a PostGIS database. The following workflows
have been implemented for Firemap:
• RunFarsite: create FARSITE configuration files based on input parameters, execute FARSITE, and return the resulting fire perimeters.
• ExportRun: convert a fire run’s perimeters to either KML or an ESRI Shapefile and
download them on the client machine via the browser.
• ShareFireRun: save the fire run’s input parameters, e.g., weather conditions, simulation
length, etc., output fire perimeters, along with who executed the fire run to a PostGIS
database.
• ListSharedRuns: list the fire runs stored in the PostGIS database.

• GetSharedRuns: load one or more fire runs from the PostGIS database. The retrieved
fire runs are added to Firemap as fire perimeter layers.

LiveWx

LiveWx provides real-time measurements from HPWREN weather sensors co-located with many
of the tower-mounted cameras. These sensors report wind measurements every second, and air
temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity every ten seconds. LiveWx sends new measurements to clients via a WebSocket as soon as the data appears on the HPWREN multicast
network. A WebSocket is used instead of REST since there is a continual stream of measurements from the sensors.
When the Real-time Weather Stations Layer is enabled, Firemap opens a WebSocket connection to LiveWx, and updates the layer in real-time as measurements are received. These
high-frequency updates not only give the current observations, but also highlight the variability
in weather conditions, which is lost for stations that provide measurements less frequently such
as once every ten minutes or hour.

Conclusions and Future Work

This paper has presented the Firemap interactive web application for predictive fire modeling
and visualization, and explained how Firemap interacts with the Pylaski, GeoServer, Kepler
WebView, and LiveWx data services within WIFIRE. The presented extensions to the WIFIRE
end-to-end cyberinfrastructure, for the first time, enables firefighting and other emergency
officials to perform near real-time data-driven predictive wildfire modeling via web-enabled
visual interfaces. The Firemap tools greatly simplify visualization of both current and historical
geospatial datasets related to wildfires such as weather observations, satellite detections, and
surface fuels.
We are working to enhance the Firemap architecture in several ways. Data assimilation
demonstrated in the WIFIRE system will be integrated into Firemap to improve prediction
accuracy by adjusting for limited or noisy data. We are also exploring machine learning techniques to predict model execution time to provide better feedback in Firemap and to optimize
job scheduling for large long-running fire models. Additional data sources are being investigated
such as drone measurements and imagery, and social network feeds relating to active wildfires.
The extensible nature of the Firemap web tool and the WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure enables
integration of not only new data sources and fire modeling improvements, but also machine
learning on location specific characterization of environmental conditions and deep learning for
fire surveillance and fuel monitoring using high-resolution imagery.
As a conclusion, our interactions to date with firefighting agencies and wildfire modeling
community has proven the usefulness of the developed tools both in the context of real-life fire
situations and synthesizing data for wildfire modeling improvements. Although the modeling
products have been endorsed as within expected boundaries by the operations fire behavior
analysts we have worked with, we are currently working on a more scientific evaluation of the
accuracy of the predictive models in comparison to final fire boundaries.
