Abstract
The geometry, energetics and dipole moment of the most stable conformers of cytosine in the ground
state were calculated at different density functional methods, namely, B3LYP, M06-2X, ωB97-D and
PEBPEB methods and the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set. The most stable conformer, the keto-amino
conformer is only 1 Kcal/mol more stable than the imino-enol form. The ultrafast radiationless decay
mechanism has been theoretically investigated using Complete Active Space Multiconfiguration SCF
calculation. The conical intersection seam was searched in the full dimensional space for the
vibrational degrees of freedom. A new conical intersection has been identified, a semi-planar conical
intersection (SPCI) with main deformations inside the cytosine ring and C=O bond. The g-vector and
h-vector for the semi-planar conical intersection were calculated and discussed along with their
geometrical parameters. A classical trajectory dynamic simulation has been performed to characterize
and identify the evolution of geometry and energy changes of the SPCI with time.

1. Introduction
Ultrafast internal conversion (IC) from an upper electronic state (S1) to the ground electronic state
(S0) though a conical intersection (CI), can play an essential role in the initial steps of the
decomposition of energetic materials. Such nonradiative processes following electronic excitation can
quench emission and store the excitation energy in the vibrational degrees of freedom of the ground
electronic state. The ability of DNA and RNA to absorb ultraviolet light without significant reaction

or fluorescence is a property that is vital for life.[1] with excited-state lifetime in the picoseconds time
scale at values from 1 to 3 ps.[2]
It has been proposed that nucleobases, when excited by UV light, rapidly funnel their excited-state
population to the ground state through conical intersections between the first excited singlet state, S1,
and the ground state surface, S0.[1,3-7]
Two possible decay mechanisms from S1 to S0 were proposed through two conical intersections
the so-called “sofa” and “twist”[8-11,12]. Although, the literature contains several attempt to locate
and identify the CI’s in the cytosine radiationless decay, yet the problem is far from being solved. This
is simply because, CIs are not isolated points but rather 3N-8 dimensional seams (N is number of
atoms). Therefore, it seems necessary to explore wider range of geometries within the CI seams and
examine which part of the seam is more accessible. The present study aims to contribute to the
understanding of the ultrafast radiaionless decay of cytosine. To achieve this goal, the three most
stable tautomers of cytosine will be first examined and the possibility of contributing to the ultrafast
decay will be discussed. Second, this paper reports preliminary results for a new conical intersection
that has a smaller deformation in geometry relative to the already reported conical intersections.
Classical trajectory dynamics simulation and charge density analysis will be carried out for the
proposed CI.

Computational details
2.1. Ground state geometry optimization

All geometry optimizations, and vibrational frequency calculations were carried out using the
Gaussian 09 software package.[13] No symmetry constrains were applied during the geometry
optimization. Different density functional methods namely, B3LYP[14], M06-2x[15], ωB97-D[16] and
PEP[17] methods, are used. The triple zeta Gaussian basis set 6-311++G(2df,2p)[18] is employed.
Classical trajectory dynamic simulations [19] have been performed using the Atom Centered
Density Matrix Propagation (ADMP) molecular dynamics model [20]. In this approach, in order to
account for all the degrees of freedom of the system, the dynamics involve classical trajectories for the
nuclei, in combination with DFT quantum calculations for the electrons.

2.2. Conical intersection
Complete Active Space Multi-configuration SCF (CASSCF)[21] level of theory with the 6311++G** basis set[18] were used to calculate the energies of electronic states and to optimize the
geometrical structures of the conical intersections between two states. The CASSCF active space for
cytosine include 4 occupied molecular orbitals (two π and two lone pairs) and 5 unoccupied molecular
orbitals (three π* and two σ*).

It has been experimentally established that cytosine exists as three stable tautomers [22-24] which
are illustrated in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1: The experimentally confirmed stable tautomers and rotomers of cytosine.

Forms (a) and (b) , are rotomers for the imino-keto tautomer , (e) and (f) are rotomers for the
amino-enol tautomer, whereas (c) is the amino-keto tautomer. Conformer (a) seems to be the least
stable by 3.55 Kcal/mol followed by conformer (b) by 2.32 Kcal/mol relative to conformer c, the most
stable conformer. Conformers e and f are predicted to be slightly less stable by all the DFT methods
employed except the M06-2x method which predicted both e and f to be more stable with e as the
global minimum. Table 1 presents the relative energies of the three most stable conformers computed
at different levels of theory.

The fact that c is predicted to be the most stable form is in agreement with the recent theoretical
calculations. However, the fact that conformers e and f are so close in energy would suggest the
possibility that these conformations may play a role in the mechanism of photodissociation of cytosine.

3.2 Radiationless decay pathways
In case of cytosine the previously reported data [8-11] focus on two possible direct pathways via
two conical intersections the called “sofa” and “twist” and reported almost the same energy barrier of
0.14 eV, to access them.[8] This in fact doesn’t explain the existence of more than one life time for the
excited state. In the present work, a CASSCF computation of the potential energy surfaces of the low
laying ππ* excited state have been launched. We located, identified and localized both the “sofa” and
the ”twist” conical intersections previously reported. The energy of the sofa and twist conical
intersections are 4.23 eV and 4.08 eV respectively relative to cytosine ground state.

Furthermore, our search in the active space has lead to the localization and identification of a third
conical intersection which has not been reported before. The geometry of this new conical intersection
is shown in Figure 1. The new suggested conical intersection has almost planar structure (semi-planar)
with minimal deviation from the ground state geometry as compared to the sofa or twist ones that may
suggest that it would be more accessible than the other two already reported conical intersection. The
energy of semi-planar conical intersection (SPCI) is 3.97 eV relative to conformer c.
The main deviation in our conical intersection is mainly on the cytosine ring with maximum
change in bond length C3-N6 and C4-O8. They both suffer marked elongation of 0.2 Ǻ. All bond
lengths involving H atoms do not show any significant elongations in the semi-planar conical
intersection (SPCI) which agree with recently reported Broad-band transient absorption spectroscopy
that rule out the involvement of excited state proton transfer mechanism for cytosine. In this SPCI,
angles and dihedral angles show however, considerable changes as compared to the corresponding
values in cytosine itself. Thus, the C1-N5-C4 is reduced by 7o, and the N5-C4-N6 is enlarged by 11o.
The out-of-plane deformation of the cytosine ring in case of the SPCI amounts to 20o. The above
discussion and results of the present work indicate that the main deformations in the SPCI is localized
in the C3-N6-C4(O8)-N5 part of the ring.

displays the numbering system, the dipole moment vector and the atomic charges (in parentheses)

The PES in the vicinity of a point in the CI seam is often characterized by the g and h vectors defined
before. The g vector, is termed as the energy difference gradient whereas, the h vector represent the
interstate coupling vector that span the so-called branching plane. The scaled g-vector and h-vector are
shown in Figure 2. The dominant components of the h-vector are on C4-O8 bond which makes the
movement of this bond to be the vital key in the formation of this conical intersection. The g-vectors
are on C2, C3,C4, N2 and O1 atoms. The g-vector results in degeneracy of state which is vital for
conical intersection.

from the trajectory dynamic Simulations.

3.3 Dynamic trajectory simulations
In order to get a much better insight into the geometric features of the SPCI, we have performed a
classical trajectory calculation to cover the immediate vicinity of this structure. Starting from initial
positions and velocities of the nuclei, molecular motion is propagated through time via classical
mechanics, using the electronic energy and forces. These calculations, provide information about how
the geometry change and distributed.
A DFT based Atom Centered Density Matrix Propagation molecular, ADMP, dynamic simulation was
performed starting at the geometry of the SPCI structure. The DFT-MD simulation was done at the
B3LYP/6-31+G** level of theory . In the trajectory simulation the temperature is kept constant at 300
K and the run was submitted for 500 points aiming to explore a conformational time domain of 50 fs.
of 0.1 fs each.
Figure 3 summaries the results of the trajectory simulation of the SPCI. It is clear that there is a low
potential energy barrier around the SPCI. This barrier amounts to only 0.138 Kcal/mol and is attained
in 1 fs. The SPCI structure then enjoys stabilization and lowering of its energy with a major geometry
changes involving the cytosine ring and twisting of the H-atoms out-of the plan of the ring.

4. Conclusions

and Future Work

The present study is an attempt to explore the ultrafast photodissociation of cytosine. The three most
stable tautomeric forms of cytosine seem very close in energy, that a statistical distribution would be
possible. This would suggest the involvement of the imino-enol form in the photodissocaition process.
A point which needs further in-depth computation and analysis. Furthermore, the implicit and explicit
effect of water as a solvent should be carefully considered.
The present study reports a preliminary identification of a new conical intersection between S1 and S0
states that has a semi-planar geometry (SPCI). This would suggest a new decay mechanism that we do
not claim that it will rule out other reported decay mechanisms but compete with them. Classical
trajectory dynamics simulation of the SPCI revealed a very low energy barrier followed by a major
geometry changes involving the cytosine ring and twisting of the H-atoms out-of the plan of the ring.
Further characterization of the SPCI and detailed vibrational analysis are required. Surface hopping
dynamics for the imino-enol form will be targeted; results will be compared with that already
published [25] for the amino-keto form of cytosine.
