Abstract. Evolution of cardiac activity is investigated by means of methods of
nonlinear dynamics, namely the method of temporal localization on the attractor
reconstructed from electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is proposed for this
purpose. Convergence for the function of topological instability at changing
dimensionality is proved both theoretically and numerically, independently on
personal features of subjects in the latter case, that provides the opportunity to
estimate the complexity of cardiac dynamics. In contrast, that instability
function normalized by its average displays different kind of behaviour that
somewhat differs for various persons and reflects their individual features.

1 Introduction
The computational complexity of topological algorithms being applied for
cardiovascular dynamics investigation makes these algorithms rather cumbersome
from standpoint of their computer time and the quantity of required experimental data
N [1]. Therefore, the total time of observation and diagnosis process becomes rather
long that may result in difficulties in clinical practice. So, in this paper we develop the
topological method based on temporal locality approach. In comparison with the most
conventional methods of nonlinear analysis based on spatial localization [1-4], the
developed method allows reduction of N and computation time as well as is insensible
to growing m on these characteristics.

2 The Algorithm for Exploration of Topological Instability
The method of delayed coordinates (affirmed mathematically by Takens [5]) for
reconstruction of phase trajectories forming an attractor RTm is given by [1,2, 4-5]

xi( m ) = ( ηi , ηi + p ,...,ηi + ( m −1 ) p ),

(1)

where η( iΔt ) = ηi , i = 1,2 ,..., N is a time series (TS) of a kinetic variable measured

with a fixed time interval Δt , τ = pΔt is the delay time, p is an integer. The points

x i( m ) ⊂ R m , R m is an Euclidean phase space with a dimension m, i = 1,2,..., L( p ,m ) ,

the common quantity of the attractor points is given by L( p ,m ) = N − p( m − 1 ) . In
accordance with (1), phase trajectories forming the attractor RTm can be represented as
a superposition of p rarefied sequences Χ1 , Χ 2 , …, Χ p shifted by one sample with
L ( p ,m )

respect to each other, those are defined as Χ s = {xs( m+ )p ( k −1) }k =s 1

.

As it was recently shown, rarefying on attractor points is reasonable for
numerical simulation of fractal-topological analysis [4]. Otherwise, using points that
are too close together in time leads to essential underestimates of the dimension, i.e.
to aggravating accuracy of the topological analysis. So, we also implement temporal
rarefying of phase trajectories for creating a subset of points with decorrelated
components resulting in essentially random distribution in the embedding space. It is
attained by the approach that is realized in the most convenient way, namely we use
only one X s for numerical experiments. That is constructed using the sequence

Ψ p = {η p , η2⋅ p , … ,η

( p)

} , and rarefying is determined with p=2. Denoting

components of Ψ p for brevity as Ψ p = {ξ1 ,ξ 2 , …,ξ

N (pp )

} , we obtain that the terms of

relative partition sequence {μ (jm) } constructed by means of segmentation of

difference-quadratic TS are defined analogously [6] as follows

where σˆ (jm ) = ∑ Δξ 2j + i , Δξ j = ξ j +1 − ξ j . Similarly [6], introduce the following

3 Numerical Simulations with ECG Signal
In this work the digitized ECG TS ς i containing N=2500 points is used, Δt = 2mc .
The initial part of measured TS is shown in Fig. 1. The obtained TS is that of an adult
healthy subject being under physical exercises. For decreasing linear autocorrelation

effect and reduction of influence of low-frequency periodical component, we use
difference TS ηi = ς i − ς i+1 instead of "raw" digitized ECG signal ς i (as well as in
[1]). The phase trajectories for three-dimensional attractors reconstructed from η i by
(1) at p = 1 and p = 20 respectively are shown in Fig. 2, a) and b), the latter case
reveals the effect of partial decorrelation (similarly [1]).

For investigation of topological dependencies, we use three databases of ECG
signals obtained from different groups of healthy adult subjects at the same conditions

Calculated dependencies (5) are shown in Fig. 3, a) and b). These dependencies
display sufficient convergence for m ≥ m0 , i.e. m0 is just the value of a dimension
that provides preservation of topological structure of phase trajectories at enlarging
dimensionality beyond m0 and thus can be really considered as the minimal

embedding dimension of the attractor. The convergence of Y (m) is shown to be of
the same character, independently on individual features of subjects, and one can
conclude that m0 = 6 is sufficient for optimal embedding of the attractor into Takens'
phase space. On the other hand, the dependence Y (m) is approximately linear at

m ≥ m0 , but it differs for various persons with respect to average level of
convergence and a slant angle. Evidently, it can provide some additional information
concerning individual features of subjects that seems to be useful for the sake of early
diagnosis.

4 Conclusions
The obtained results of m0 determined on Y (m) are in good coincidence with those
obtained in [1] by the Grassberger - Procaccia algorithm (GPA), where slopes of the
plots ln C (l ) versus ln l appear to be same for m ≥ 6. It is worth to note that in GPA
N=16000 [1],. while in our experiments N=2500 (moreover, the length of really used
rarefied TS N (pp ) = 1250 ) that means the significant reduction of data.
