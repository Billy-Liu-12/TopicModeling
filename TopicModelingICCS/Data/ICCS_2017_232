consideration by several types of configuration models or modifications of maximum entropy
approaches. Other studies show the maximum entropy approach underestimates systemic risk
in some cases. In addition, maximum entropy method basely generates random graphs therefore
the networks reconstructed in such way usually demonstrate degree distribution with Poisson
properties. In this way, other algorithms of networks reconstruction, providing raw material for
more accurate and comprehensive exploration of systemic risk in complex interbank markets,
are important to develop.
To diminish above mentioned imperfect we apply the simulated annealing algorithm to
the issue of Russian interbank network reconstruction, which allows us to approximate graph
properties more accurate. As empirical data for reconstruction we take the values of total
interbank assets and liabilities of the largest 504 Russian banks. Data are considered for the
period from January to December 2013. The results obtained are compared with maximum
entropy method, since its popularity, and with low and minimum density methods, since they
replicate density more plausibly.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Literature review (sec. 2) considers some existing methods of interbank network reconstruction, heuristic algorithms for complex networks
reconstructions reproducing topological properties as well as functional network properties, and
related empirical studies on the topological properties of Russian interbank market. Section 3
presents a brief description of methods we used. Dataset is described in Section 4. Section 5
demonstrates the comparison of algorithms applied for Russian interbank network reconstruction, and finally, discussion, future work and conclusion are observed.

Related Work
Naive Approaches to Networks Reconstruction

The often used maximum entropy method for interbank market reconstruction was shown to
underestimate systemic risk [18], since this reconstructs a complete graph. Links weights are
assigned uniformly in accordance with initial restrictions. After that the distance between resulting matrix and restriction matrix (with the values of bank assets and liabilities) is minimized
via Kullback-Leibler divergence [6, 12]. This was an algorithm of sparse network reconstruction
that was presented by [16] to decrease the density of resulting graph. Musmeci [19] offered the
bootstrapping method for reconstruction, which is based on known topological properties of a
sub-graph and use them to generate the ensemble of networks. The authors were focused on
topological features which mostly affect shock contagion (namely, density and k-core).
Methods described in [3] are based on the knowledge about sub-graph structure or global
non-topological features and are aimed to reconstruct “macroscopic or statistical properties”.
In [15] authors emphasize the difficulty of weighted networks reconstruction and present the
enhanced analytical and unbiased maximum entropy method that is computationally efficient
and does not require network samples as input. Anand et al. [2] diminish the flaw of graph
completeness in the maximum entropy approach by presenting the minimum and low density
methods, which reconstruct random networks with density being tuned by some λ parameter.
Despite the maximum entropy method was being repeatedly criticized, this continues to be
used and modified. The authors of [7] apply maximum entropy approach to the ensemble of
networks and combine that with capital asset pricing model. They show the model is appropriate for the estimation of systemic risk due to fire sales spillover. The approach presented in [20]
is based on statistical mechanics techniques applied to bipartite market networks and this is
referred to as fitness-induced bipartite configuration model (FiBiCM). The approach was vali2

dated via data from the Bloomberg terminal (NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX filing data). The
estimation of edges probabilities is made by maximum-entropy inference, followed by a densitycorrected gravity model to assign position weights. The disadvantage making this approach
inappropriate for us is the number of links which is required for method, since we only have
information about total assets and liabilities of a bank. The other particularity of the approach
presented is that this is a bipartite graph which is output.

2.2

Using Metaheuristics for Network Reconstruction

Heuristic algorithms were widely used for reconstruction of different biological networks such
as gene regulatory, chemical reactions, phylogenetic, etc. Dorier et al. [8] use genetic algorithm
to construct Boolean networks, reproducing “experimentally observed behaviour in terms of
attractors and the transitions that occur between them under specific perturbations”. Ward
et al. [21] compare three heuristic methods degradation with increase of noise in data. Similar
comparison of quite another methods was presented in [4, 17].
Flexible algorithm for complex networks reconstruction based on simulated annealing was
presented in [10]. The algorithm allows to replicate graph structures which are not reproducible
by traditional network generative models. At the same time, the simulated annealing algorithm
was used by Kashirin et al. [11] to reproduce functional properties of complex networks and
has no necessary support for interbank networks reconstruction.

Background

The problem of interbank networks reconstruction looks as follows. Let N be the number of
banks in a network, A = {aij } be an adjacency matrix of interbank exposures. That mean
that bank i lends money to bank j. For each bank we know only the total values of its assets
and
columns of adjacency matrix are known: ∀i
N liabilities, i.e. only the sums of rowsand
N
j=1 aij = Ai — assets of bank i, Li =
j=1 aji — liabilities of a bank i. To reconstruct
interbank network is to estimate the corresponding adjacency matrix A with some matrix
A∗ = {a∗ij } using incomplete information about the sums of its rows and columns.

3.1

Maximum Entropy Method

Entropy maximization method [18, 12] assumes that all assets are distributed proportionally
over all banks. That means if we consider a bank i with assets
 Ai then reconstructed matrix
values a∗ij follow the rule: ∀i ∈ [1; N ] a∗i1 ≈ · · · ≈ a∗iN ; A∗i = j a∗ij ≈ Ai .

The Kullback–Leibler divergence, which is used to minimize the distance between A and
A∗ , is an information measure describing the distance between two probabilistic distributions,
say p1 and p2 , such that for any discrete distributions this equals to:
DKL (p1 , p2 ) =

Minimum and Low Density

Minimum density algorithm [2], on the contrary, minimizes the number of links and assume
disassortative mixing. In this way, the optimization problem with restrictions can be formulated:

1(a∗ij > 0) → min;

where 1(X) equals to 1 if X is true and equals to 0, otherwise. Further there are differences
of total asset values and weighted sums of already existing edges introduced to evaluate edge
probabilities over iterations.
Since the minimum density method demonstrates other extreme than the maximum entropy
one, we also consider its modification — a low density method [2] — where edge probabilities
are modified with λ multiplier allowing to vary network density.

3.3

Simulated Annealing

This approach to network reconstruction problem was proposed in [9] and the description is
presented here in accordance to it.
Network reconstruction problem is considered as multi-objective optimization problem. We
consider topological graph properties, e. g., degree distribution, average path length, or other
graph invariants (i.e. some function f : G → R, which maps a graph to a real number1 ).
Without loss of generality, there also can be considered functional graph properties, which
characterize processes in a graph (e.g. contagion) and determined by a modeled phenomena.
Let Φ = (f1 , . . . , fM ) be a set of graph invariant considered. And Π = {π1 , . . . , πM } be their
objective values.Then the issue is to find some graph G∗ demonstrating desired properties such
that ∀i ∈ N 1  i  M fi (G∗ ) ≈ πi . Then an aggregate objective function is

The simulated annealing (SA) algorithm approximates the global optimum of a function
in a large search space. The method was inspired by metallurgy and implies the change of
temperature affects thermodynamic free energy of a system. The process of heating and cooling
down the material affects the probability of an atom to change its state which results in free

energy change. From the mathematical point of view, the float probability of new decision
acceptance allows to avoid local optimum. In addition, the law of temperature changes is
important parameter of simulated annealing algorithm since this affects the convergence rate
of the algorithms. Low convergence rate makes the algorithm inefficient, at the same time,
high convergence rate increase the probability of local optimal solution to be returned. It was
empirically shown that good results are obtained when the law of temperature changes is
T (t) =

T0
,
1+r·t

(8)

where r is cooling rate, and t is iteration number. This law provides fast search in the beginning
of simulation and more detailed in the end.
The SA algorithm for network reconstruction is designed for graphs with fixed number of
nodes. It begins with an initial graph and then rewire edges to obtain desired structure of a
graph following steps described in an algorithm 1.

Graph modification (mutation) is provided by adding edges between two random nodes,
adding edges between two friends of friends, deletion of edges between two random adjacent
nodes, and edges rewiring. The optimum number of graph modifications per one iteration was
shown to be linear dependent on network density and number of nodes [10].

Data

Empirical network topologies are taken as in the study by Leonidov and Rumyantsev [13]
(in Russian). The authors considered exposures of different maturity taken from daily and
monthly reports. Transactions with the central bank were not considered, since they do not
contribute to systemic risk in the interbank market. As a result, on the average 504 banks
per day were considered. It was mentioned that overnight exposures far exceed other ones.
Interbank network topology was characterized by degree distribution, average clustering coefficient, in- and out- average clustering coefficient and it was shown how total interbank asset and
liability values grow with increase of the corresponding node degree. A network demonstrated
bow-tie structure and disassortative mixing was shown. Similar description can be found in the
corresponding English paper [14].
Empirical incomplete data of Russian interbank market, namely, total interbank assets
and liabilities values for banks, are taken from banks’ annual reports, which was collected from

Results

In this section we consider the application of simulated annealing algorithm to reconstruction of
Russian interbank market. The results are compared with reconstructed networks, which were
provided by maximum entropy, minimum density and low density algorithms. Total values of
assets and liabilities of 504 largest banks of Russian interbank market are considered as input
empirical incomplete data (see details in sec. 4). Graph properties for approximation are also
presented in Section 4.
The implementation of maximum entropy, minimum density and low density methods, considered in this study, can be found in [5] and these methods correspond to description presented
in [2]. As parameters of temperature modification law in simulated annealing algorithm for network reconstruction we take initial temperature T0 = 0.03 and r = 0.001 (see formula 8). And
it is the random graph obtained with maximum entropy method that is used as initial graph
in the algorithm.
The experiments confirm (see table 1) results of Anand et al. [2], that both maximum
entropy and minimum density methods provides unrealistic networks from the point of all
considered network properties. At the same time, low density method demonstrates more
realistic average values of degree distribution (of the networks obtained). Nevertheless, average
clustering coefficient is higher than empirical one, despite the similarity of graphs densities.
The simulating annealing algorithm for network reconstruction provides networks with realistic
density and average clustering coefficient and rather similar values of average out-degree.
Figure 1 shows the detailed information on dynamics of the network modification during
the reconstruction using simulated annealing algorithm. It is shown how energy function is
minimized during the process of network modification, and how this process affects the changes
of graph topological properties. As an example of graph topological properties modification the
dynamics of clustering coefficient is presented. The intensity of manipulations with graph over
iterations are shown in Figure 1, where number of added and deleted edges and total number
of edges are presented.
The networks generated by all four considered algorithms are illustrated in Figure 2. One
can see sparse network generated with minimum density algorithm (fig. 2a) and dense network
provided by maximum entropy algorithm (fig. 2c). The first of them has lots of connected
component, while the second one has one connected component and looks like complete graph.

Low density and simulated annealing networks have quite similar density, nevertheless, one
can see a sizable discrepancy between modularity and connectivity of the obtained examples.
Low density network demonstrates a large number of connected components with two strongly
connected blocks. At the same time simulated annealing algorithm generates a connected graph
with high modular structure being seen.

Discussion and Conclusion

The experiments presented for Russian interbank market reconstruction. The comparison show
that low density and simulated annealing algorithms reconstruct considered graph properties
in more realistic way. Nevertheless, low density algorithm generates the overvalued clustering
coefficient, despite the similarity in the graph density values for simulated annealing algorithm.
This results from the way of controlling density in the low density method, which does not allow
to obtain connected network. And this is the reason of average clustering coefficient increase.
Therefore, using metaheuristics seems to be more appropriate for the problem of interbank
network reconstruction, and require modifications providing better quality of reconstructed
networks.
In the metaheuristic algorithm we use the random graph obtained with maximum entropy
method as initial solution. This could be the reason of resulting degree distribution which
demonstrates Poison properties. To obtain easier power law degree distribution the corresponding initial sample possibly should be used. Nevertheless, this modification brings the risk
of local optimum issue.
Simulated annealing algorithm for network reconstruction is shown to generate connected
interbank networks with desired average clustering coefficient, density and average degree. Nevertheless, we are to enhance the algorithm for presenting more accurate degree distribution
properties and more properly reconstruction of edges direction. In addition, some local bank
properties and their intention of portfolio optimization could be considered as additional restriction during the network reconstruction.
