Abstract. In this paper, as an extension of the concept of vertexneighbor-integrity of graphs, we introduce the notion of vertex-neighborintegrity of digraphs. Let D = (V, A) be a digraph. The open and
closed out-neighborhoods of a set S ⊆ V are denoted by N + (S) =
{v : uv ∈ A(D), u ∈ S, v ∈ V \ S} and N + [S] = N + (S) S, respectively. The vertex-neighbor-integrity of the digraph D is deﬁned as
V N I(D) = min {|S| + m(D/S + )}, where D/S + := D − N + [S] and
S⊆V

m(D/S + ) denotes the order of a maximum strong component of D/S + .
We ﬁrst discuss some basic properties of the vertex-neighbor-integrity of
digraphs, and then using these properties we study the maximum vertexneighbor-integrity which can be obtained by orienting the edges of Kn
and Ks,t .
Keywords: Vertex-neighbor-integrity, directed vertex-neighbor-integrity, orientation.

Introduction

Among several graph parameters, is the integrity introduced by Barefoot, Entringer, and Swart [1], [2] as an alternative measure of the vulnerability of graphs
to disruption caused by the removal of vertices. In 1996, modeling a spy network
by a graph whose vertices represent the agents and whose edges represent the
lines of communication, Cozzens and Wu [3], [4] introduced a new graph parameter called “vertex-neighbor-integrity”. In a spy network, if a spy is betrayed
or arrested, then the espionage agency can no longer trust any of the spies with
whom he or she was in direct communication. Clearly this means that the vertex
representing the discovered spy and all its neighbors become eﬃciently useless
to the network as a whole. Hence one way of measuring the robustness of such
spy network is to consider the eﬀect of removing a set of vertices and all of its
neighbors from the graph.
Let G = (V, E) be a graph and m(G) be the order of a maximum component
of G. The integrity I(G) and the edge-integrity I (G) are deﬁned respectively
as I(G) = min {|S| + m(G − S)} and I (G) = min {|T | + m(G − T )}. A vertex

is deleted from G. The survival graph is denoted by G/S. The vertex-neighborintegrity of G, V N I(G), is deﬁned as
V N I(G) = min {|S| + m(G/S)} .
S⊆V

For the results on the vertex-neighbor-integrity of graphs see [3], [4], [5] and [8].
Until quite recently, the studies of the vulnerability parameters of networks
have focus on undirected graphs. Since many situations can be modeled by directed graphs, it is quite natural to consider such vulnerability parameters for
digraphs as well. Based on this idea, Goddard and Vandell [9] extended the concept of integrity to digraphs and Vandell [10] extended edge-integrity to digraphs.
They introduced in [9] and [10] respectively the integrity and the arc-integrity of
digraphs. The integrity and the arc-integrity of a digraph D = (V, A) are deﬁned
respectively as I(D) = min {|S| + m(D − S)} and I (D) = min {|T | + m(D − T )},
T ⊆A

S⊆V

where m(H) stands for the order of a maximum strong component of H. In [9]
and [10], after some basic properties of I(D) and I (D), the authors studied
the maximum (arc-)integrity which can be obtained by orienting the edges of
graphs.
Motivated by the above work of Goddard and Vandell, we extend the concept of vertex-neighbor-integrity to digraphs and introduce the directed vertexneighbor-integrity of graphs. The idea behind our extension is the following.
Consider a spy network modeled by a simple digraph D = (V, A) whose vertices represent agents and whose arcs represent directed line of communications,
where an arc uv means that u is a superior of v, and in operations v receives
orders from his or her superior u, but never knows who u is. Hence when the
agent u is discovered, all the subordinates of u can no longer be trusted, but the
superiors of u are still safe for the whole network. Such a betrayals are clearly
equivalent to the removal of the closed out-neighborhood of u in the modeling
digraph.
Let D = (V, A) be a simple digraph and u ∈ V (D). The open and closed
out-neighborhoods of u are deﬁned as N + (u) = {v ∈ V (D) : uv ∈ A(D)} and
N + [u] = N + (u)∪{u}, respectively. For a subset S of V , the open and closed outneighborhoods are deﬁned as N + (S) =
N + (v) − S and N + [S] = N + (S) ∪ S,
v∈S

respectively. The open and closed in-neighborhoods of a vertex v and a set S ⊆ V
are deﬁned similarly. Let d+ (v) = |N + (v)| and d− (v) = |N − (v)|. We say that
a vertex u dominates v if uv ∈ A(D). A set S ⊆ V is called a dominating set
if N + [S] = V . In particular, when S = {u} is a dominating set we call u a
dominating vertex.
Following Cozzens and Wu, we introduce the concept of vertex subversion
strategy in digraphs. A vertex u is said to be subverted from D, if the closed
out-neighborhood N + [u] is deleted from D. A set of vertices S in D is called a
vertex subversion strategy of D, if the closed out-neighborhood of S is deleted
from D, i.e., each of the vertices in S has been subverted from D. Let D/S +

372

denote the subgraph left after the closed out-neighborhood N + [S] has been
deleted from D. The vertex-neighbor-integrity of D, V N I(D), then is deﬁned as
V N I(D) = min {|S| + m(D/S + )} .
S⊆V (D)

And the directed vertex-neighbor-integrity, V N I(G), of a graph G is deﬁned as
V N I(G) = max{V N I(D) : D is an orientation of G} .
D

A set S ⊆ V (D) is called an optimal subset of V if V N I(D) = |S| + m(D/S + ).

Some Basic Properties of Vertex-Neighbor-Integrity of
Digraphs

In this section we present some basic properties of the vertex-neighbor-integrity
of digraphs.
Property 1. It is easy to see that there exist digraphs D1 and D2 and two
subdigraphs H1 ⊂ D1 and H2 ⊂ D2 such that V N I(D1 ) > V N I(H1 ) and
V N I(D2 ) < V N I(H2 ).
Property 2. V N I(D) = 1 if and only if D has no directed cycle or there exists
a dominating vertex in D.
Proof. The suﬃciency is obvious. Suppose that V N I(G) = 1 and D has a directed cycle. Let S be a subset of V such that V N I(D) = |S| + m(D/S + ) = 1.
Since D has a directed cycle necessarily |S| = 1 and m(D/S + ) = 0, hence D has
a dominating vertex.
Property 3. If D∗ is a digraph obtained from a digraph D by reversing one arc
of D, then V N I(D) − 1 ≤ V N I(D∗ ) ≤ V N I(D) + 1.
Proof. By symmetry, it suﬃces to show that V N I(D∗ ) ≤ V N I(D) + 1. Suppose
that uv ∈ A(D) and D∗ is obtained from D by reversing uv. Then d+
D∗ (u) =

|S|+m(D/S + ). Note that S may be empty. Let S1 = S ∪{v}. Then m(D∗ /S1+ ) ≤
m(D/S + ), consequently V N I(D∗ ) ≤ |S1 | + m(D∗ /S1+ ) ≤ |S| + 1 + m(D/S + ) =
1 + V N I(D).
Property 4. Let u be a vertex of D with d+ (u) = 0. If D − u has no dominating
vertex, then V N I(D − u) = V N I(D).
Proof. If D is acyclic, then too is D − u. In this case, since D − u has no dominating vertex, we have V N I(D − u) = V N I(D) = 1. Assume that D contains
a directed cycle. Since d+ (u) = 0, u is not in any directed cycle of D. If S ⊆ V
such that V N I(D) = |S| + m(D/S + ), then u ∈ S. For otherwise, v ∈ S for
any v ∈ N − (u). But then m(D/S1+ ) = m(D/S + ) for S1 = S − u, and hence

|S1 | + m(D/S1+ ) = |S| − 1 + m(D/S + ) = V N I(D) − 1, a contradiction. If S ∩
{u}− = ∅, then clearly V N I(D−u) = V N I(D). Finally suppose that S∩{u}− =
∅ for every optimal subset S of V . Then we have m((D−u)/S +) = m(D/S + ) and
V N I(D −u) ≤ |S| + m((D − u)/S + ) = |S|+m(D/S +) = V N I(D). Let T be an
optimal subset of V (D − u). Then m(D/T + ) = m((D − u)/T + ), as d+ (u) = 0.
Now V N I(D) ≤ |T | + m(D/T + ) = |T | + m((D − u)/T +) = V N I(D − u). Hence
V N I(D) = V N I(D − u).
Remark 1. Let u ∈ V (D). If d+ (u) = 0 and D − u has no dominating vertex,
then no optimal subset S of V contains u.
Property 5. Let D be a digraph with δ − (D) > 0 and contain a directed cycle.
Then V N I(D) = 2 if and only if at least one of the following holds.
(i)
m(D) = 2;
(ii) there exists u in D such that D/{u}+ is acyclic;
(iii) there exist distinct u and v in D such that N + [u] ∪ N + [v] = V (D).
Proof. By the assumption D has a directed cycle and has no dominating vertex.
By Property 2 we have V N I(D) ≥ 2. If one of (i), (ii) and (iii) occurs, then
certainly we have V N I(D) ≤ 2 and hence V N I(D) = 2. Suppose V N I(D) = 2,
and let S be a subset of V such that V N I(D) = |S| + m(D/S + ) = 2. The
possible values of (S, m(D/S + )) are (0, 2), (1, 1) and (2, 0), which imply that at
least one of (i), (ii) and (iii) holds.

Directed Vertex-Neighbor-Integrity of Kn and Ks,t

In this section, we ﬁrst present bounds for the directed vertex-neighbor-integrity
of Kn , and then we determine the directed vertex-neighbor-integrity of Ks,t (s ≤
t) for s = 3, 4.
We give an orientation, denoted by Dn , of a complete graph Kn . Let V (D2 ) =
{v1 , v2 } and A(D2 ) = (v1 , v2 ). Suppose Dn has been deﬁned. Then Dn+1 is
orientated according to the following regulations.
When n + 1 is odd, V (Dn+1 ) = V (Dn ) ∪ {vn+1 } and A(Dn+1 ) = A(Dn ) ∪
{(vi , vn+1 ) when d− (vi ) ≥ n2 , and (vn+1 , vi ) otherwise}.
When n + 1 is even, V (Dn+1 ) = V (Dn ) ∪ {vn+1 } and A(Dn+1 ) = A(Dn ) ∪
and (vn+1 , vi ) otherwise}.
{(vi , vn+1 ) when i ≤ n+1

Theorem 1. Let Dn (n ≥ 2) be the orientation of Kn deﬁned as above. Then
⎧
⎨ 1, n = 2,
V N I(Dn ) = 2, n is odd or n is even with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10,
⎩
3, n is even with n ≥ 12.
Proof. Suppose n is odd. By the deﬁnition of Dn , the vertex vn dominates the
vertices u with d+ (u) − d− (u) = 1. In Dn , as n − 1 is even, vn−1 dominates
the vertices vj for n−1
2 + 1 ≤ j ≤ n, j = n − 1, and there are arcs (vi , vn−1 )
for i ≤ n−1
.
In
D
the
vertex vn dominates the vertices vi for i ≤ n−1
n

N + [vn−1 ] ∪ N + [vn ] = V (Dn ), and V N I(Dn ) ≤ 2. On the other hand, since Dn
contains directed cycles, we have V N I(Dn ) ≥ 2. Thus V N I(Dn ) = 2.
Now let n ∈ {4, 6, 8, 10}. It is easy to check that {v1 , v2 }, {v2 , v3 }, {v1 , v4 } and
{v2 , v5 } are dominating sets in Dn for n = 4, 6, 8, 10, respectively. Hence in this
case V N I(Dn ) = 2 by Property 5.
Let n be even with n = 2k ≥ 12. It is not diﬃcult to see that D2k /S + = {vk }
for S = {v2k−1 , v2k }, and consequently V N I(D2k ) ≤ 3. Since D2k is strongly
connected, we have m(D2k ) > 2. Hence to prove V N I(D2k ) ≥ 3, by Property 5,
it suﬃces to show
(a) there is no vertex vi such that D2k /{vi }+ is acyclic, and
(b) there are no two vertices vi and vj (i = j) in D2k such that N + [vi ] ∪
N + [vj ] = V (D2k ).
We ﬁrst show (a). By the deﬁnition of D2k , d+ (vi ) − d− (vi ) = 1 for vi ∈
{v1 , ..., vk } and d+ (vj ) − d− (vj ) = 1 for vj ∈ {vk+1 , ..., v2k }. Since all vertices
in {v1 , ..., vk } ({vk+1 , ..., v2k }) have equal positions in D2k , it suﬃces to check
D2k /{v1 }+ and D2k /{v2k }+ , respectively. Again by the deﬁnition of D2k , v1
dominates v2j for j = 1, 2, ..., k2 , so we have D2k /{v1 }+ = {v3 , v5 , ..., v2k−1 } and
v3 v5 v7 v3 is a cycle in D2k /{v1 }+ . Similarly, v1 v2 v3 v1 is a cycle in D2k /{v2k }+ .
We prove (b) by induction on n. When n = 12, it is easy to see that D12
contains no vertices u and v such that N + [u] ∪ N + [v] = V (D12 ). Suppose that
(b) holds for D2l with 6 ≤ l < k.
Now suppose that D2k contains u and v such that N + [u] ∪ N + [v] = V (D2k ).
Then {u, v} ∩ {v2k−1 , v2k } = ∅, for otherwise N + [u] ∪ N + [v] = V (D2k−2 ), contradicting the induction hypothesis. In D2k , as N + (v2k−2 ) = {vk , ..., v2k−3 } and
N + (v2k−1 ) = {v1 , v2 ..., vk−1 } , we have {v2k−2 , v2k−1 } ∩ {u, v} = ∅. So we may
assume u = v2k and v ∈ {v1 , . . . , v2k−3 }. Since in D2k the vertex v2k dominates
vi with k + 1 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 1, the vertex v must dominate vj with 1 ≤ j ≤ k. But
then in D2k−2 , we would have N + (v) ∪ N + (v2k−1 ) = V (D2n−2 ), contradicting
the induction hypothesis.
Hence (b) is proved and this completes the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 2. If n is an integer not less than 2, then V N I(Kn ) ≤ log2

Proof. Suppose D is a tournament with n vertices. In the following, to get the
upper bound we shall determine a subset S of V such that |S| + m(D/S + ) can
not excess the upper bound.
For technical reason we denote D1 = D and n1 = n. D1 has a vertex u1

n1
n1 − 2 − 1 ≤ 2 . And D2 has a vertex u2 such that dD2 (u2 ) ≥ n22 .
We continue this process until some Dk+1 has at most 2 vertices. Then by the
construction, we have nk+1 ≤ n2k . For simplicity, we assume that ni+1 ≤ n2i
for i = 2, . . . , k − 1 and 2nk ≤ 2. Then we have nk+1 ≤ 2nk ≤ 2, consequently k ≥
log2 n2 . The minimum value of k is log2 n2 . We set S = {u1 , u2 , ..., uk } with k =
log2 n2 . Then m(D/S + ) ≤ 1, and consequently V N I(D) ≤ |S| + m(D/S + ) ≤
log2 n2 +1. Having chosen D arbitrarily, we have obtained the upper bound.

The Vertex-Neighbor-Integrity of Digraphs

Corollary 1. Let n be an integer not less than 2. Then
(i) 2 ≤ V N I(Kn ) ≤ log2 n2 + 1, if n is odd or n ∈ {4, 6, 8, 10};
(ii) 3 ≤ V N I(Kn ) ≤ log2 n2 + 1, if n is even with n ≥ 12.
Let D be an orientation of Ks,t (s ≤ t) with bipartition (X, Y ). We label X =
{x1 , . . . , xs } and Y = {y1 , . . . , yt }.
Proposition 1. V N I(K3,t ) = 2, where t ≥ 3.
Proof. We prove the proposition by using Property 5. Clearly V N I(K3,t ) ≥ 2.
Let D be an orientation of K3,t . We consider the out-degrees of vertices in Y .
N + (yi ) = X, then there exists a vertex xk ∈ X such that
If N + (Y ) =
yi ∈Y

N + (xk ) = Y , and D/{xk }+ is acyclic. So in this case V N I(D) ≤ 2. Next
suppose
N + (yi ) = X. If there exists, in addition, yk ∈ Y with d+ (yk ) ≥ 2,
yi ∈Y

then D/{yk }+ is acyclic, and again V N I(D) ≤ 2. If d+ (yi ) ≤ 1 for every yi ∈ Y
then, by Property 4, we only need to consider the vertices yj with d+ (yj ) = 1.
And in this subcase, D/{xi }+ is acyclic for every xi ∈ X, consequently again
we have V N I(D) ≤ 2. Hence V N I(K3,t ) ≤ 2.
Proposition 2. V N I(K4,t ) = 3, where t ≥ 4.
Proof. First we show V N I(K4,t ) ≥ 3. Let D be an orientation of K4,t deﬁned as
follows. For a vertex yi ∈ Y , we deﬁne N + (yi ) = {x1 , x2 } when i = 1 (mod 4);
N + (yi ) = {x1 , x3 } when i = 2 (mod 4); N + (yi ) = {x2 , x4 } when i = 3 (mod 4)
and N + (yi ) = {x3 , x4 } when i = 0 (mod 4), and the remaining edges are oriented
on the opposite direction. Let S be a subset of V (D). Since we want to prove
V N I(D) ≥ 3, we may assume that |S| < 3. If S contains only the vertices in X,
then since d+ (yi ) = 2 for every vertex yi ∈ Y , we infer that S must contain at
least two vertices to make D/S + be acyclic, so in this case |S| + m(D/S + ) = 3.
If S contains the vertices in both X and Y , then S consists of one vertex in
X and one vertex in Y , by construction obviously S is not a dominating set
and D/S + is acyclic. Thus |S| + m(D/S + ) = 3. Suppose S contains only the
vertices in Y . If |S| = 1, then obviously |S| + m(D/S + ) = 5. Hence we assume
|S| = 2, say S = {y1 , y2 }, then also |S| + m(D/S +) = 3. So from all cases above,
|S| + m(D/S +) ≥ 3 for any S ⊆ V (D). Hence V N I(D) = 3 and V N I(K4,t ) ≥ 3.
Next we show V N I(K4,t ) ≤ 3. Let D be an arbitrary orientation of Ks,t .
N + (yi ) = X, then there exists a vertex xk ∈ X such that
If N + (Y ) =
yi ∈Y

N + (xk ) = Y , and consequently V N I(D) ≤ 2 in this case.
Now suppose
N + (yi ) = X.
yi ∈Y

Case 1. There exists yk ∈ Y with d+ (yk ) ≥ 3.
In this case m(D/S + ) = 1 for S = {yk }, hence V N I(D) ≤ |S| + m(D/S + ) ≤ 2.

376

Case 2. There exists a vertex yk ∈ Y such that d+ (yk ) = max d+ (yi ) = 2.
yi ∈Y

If there exists a vertex xl ∈ X with d− (xl ) = 1 then D/{xl }+ is acyclic and
V N I(D) ≤ |{xl }| + m(D/{xl }+ ) = 2. In the remaining subcase we choose
an xj ∈ X − N + (yk ), and set S = {yk , xj }. Then m(D/S + ) = 1, and again
V N I(D) ≤ 3.
Case 3. d+ (yi ) ≤ 1 for every yi ∈ Y .
Setting S = {xj } for arbitrary xj ∈ X, we have m(D/S + ) = 1 since all vertices
yi in D/S + have no out-neighbors to X. Hence V N I(D) ≤ |S| + m(D/S + ) = 2.
From all above we have V N I(K4,t ) ≤ 3, and hence V N I(K4,t ) = 3.
