Abstract. This paper proposes an ex-post comparison of portfolio selection
strategies based on the assumption that the portfolio returns evolve as Markov
processes. Thus we propose the comparison of the ex-post final wealth obtained
with the maximization of the expected negative exponential utility and expected
power utility for different risk aversion parameters. In particular, we consider
strategies where the investors recalibrate their portfolios at a fixed temporal horizon and we compare the wealth obtained either under the assumption that returns follow a Markov chain or under the assumption we have independent
identically distributed data. Thus, we implement an heuristic algorithm for the
global optimum in order to overcome the intrinsic computational complexity of
the proposed Markovian models.
Keywords: Markov chains, expected utility, portfolio strategies, heuristic,
computational complexity.

1 Introduction
In this paper, we model the return portfolios with a Markov chain. Under this distributional hypothesis we compare expected utility portfolio strategies with the assumption
that returns are independent identically distributed.
The Markovian hypothesis have been widely used in financial modeling. In particular, in option theory, portfolio theory and risk management theory most of the
parametric processes used are Markov processes (for portfolio models see, among
others, Staino et al. (2007), Rachev et al. (2007), for option pricing models see,
among others, Cox et al. (1979), De Giovanni et al. (2008), Iaquinta and Ortobelli
(2008), for risk management models see, among others, Longerstaey and Zangari
(1996), Lamantia et al. (2006b). In addition, using the methodology proposed by
Christoffersen (1998) we can easily show that the Markovian hypothesis of asset
returns cannot be rejected (see Lamantia et al. (2006a)). However, even if most of the
parametric processes used in financial applications are Markov processes, only recently it has been shown that we can easily maximize inter-temporal performance
measures assuming return portfolios following a Markov chain (see Angelelli and
Ortobelli (2008)). In this paper we first propose some algorithms that reduce the complexity of the portfolio selection problems based on the Markovianity of the gross

returns. In particular, we use the method discussed by Iaquinta and Ortobelli (2006)
for non parametric Markovian processes where the transition matrix depends directly
on the portfolio weights. This algorithm permits to predict future asset returns and
their distributions in polynomial computational times. However, the dependence on
the portfolio weights of the transition matrix implies that the computational complexity of these portfolio problems is much higher than assuming that historical observations of returns are independent identically distributed. As a matter of fact, if we use
classic methods for global optimum (such as simulated annealing type algorithms see
Leccadito et al. (2007)) we cannot solve these problems in reasonable computational
times. In order to reduce the computational complexity of these portfolio selection
strategies, we use the optimization heuristic proposed by Angelelli and Ortobelli
(2008). That algorithm permits to check the n-dimensional simplex to approximate
the global optimum. Secondly, we propose an empirical comparison among portfolio
selection strategies based on the optimization of expected utility of future wealth. We
use the negative exponential utility and the power utility with different degrees of risk
aversion. We propose an ex-post analysis where we compare the sample path of
wealth obtained assuming that the investors recalibrate their portfolios at a fixed temporal horizon. Since any of these portfolio strategies is based on the estimation of the
distribution of the returns at future times, we get a substantial difference when portfolio selection strategies are developed using the Markovian assumption respect to those
based on the assumption that returns are independent identically distributed. So, when
we apply Markovian strategies on twenty components of the Dow Jones Industrials,
we show that we always get higher returns with respect to returns obtained by means
of classic strategies.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we show how to model non parametric Markov chains and we formalize the maximum expected utility problem with
Markov chains. In Section 3 we discuss the ex-post empirical comparison. In the last
Section, we briefly summarize the paper.

2 Maximum Expected Utility with Non Parametric Markov
Processes
In this section we deal the portfolio selection problem among n risky assets with gross
returns zt +1 = [ z1, t +1 ,… , z n, t +1 ]′ assuming that the portfolio process is described by a

homogeneous Markov chain with N states. In particular, we assume that investors
want to maximize their utility of wealth at a given future date T. We denote by
x = [ x1 ,… , xn ]′ the vector of the positions taken in the n risky assets, then the portfon

lio return during the period [t, t+1] is given by z( x ), t +1 = x′zt +1 = ∑xi zi , t +1 .
i =1

2.1 The Markovian Evolution Process

Next, we consider the range (min k z( x ), k ; max k z( x ), k ) of the portfolio gross returns,
where z( x ), k is the k-th past observation of the portfolio z( x ) . Without loss of generality

we assume that the N states z((xi ))

of portfolio gross return are ordered as follows

for i = 1,..., N − 1 . Since we want to have a recombining tree of the

Markov chain, we first divide the portfolio support (min k z( x ), k ; max k z( x ), k ) in N ini/N

⎛ min k z( x ), k ⎞
tervals (a( x ), i ; a( x ), i −1 ) where a( x ), i = ⎜
⎟ ⋅ max k z( x ), k , i = 0,1,… , N is
⎜ max k z( x ), k ⎟
⎝
⎠
decreasing with index i. Then, we compute the return associated to each state as the
geometric average of the extremes of the interval (a( x ), i ; a( x ), i −1 ) , that is

> 1 . Let us assume that the initial

wealth W0 at time 0 is equal to 1, while for each possible wealth Wt at time t we have
N possible different values Wt +1 = Wt z((xi )) (i=1,…,N) at time t+1. Thanks to the recombining effect of the Markov chain we have 1 + k ( N − 1) possible values after k steps

that

are

by

the

formula

w((xi ,)k ) = ( z((1)x ) ) k u (1−i )

i = 1,..., ( N − 1)k + 1 , where the i-th node at time k of the Markovian tree corresponds

to wealth w((xi ,)k ) . Moreover, all possible values of the random wealth Wk ( x) can be
stored in a matrix with k columns and 1 + k ( N − 1) rows resulting in O( Nk 2 ) memory space requirement. Since we assume homogeneous Markov chain the transition
matrix P = [ pi , j ] does not depend on time and the entries pi , j are estimated using the
maximum likelihood estimates pˆ i , j =

π ij ( K )
πi ( K )

, where π ij ( K ) is the number of observa-

tions (out of K observations) that transit from the i-th state to the j-th state and
π i ( K ) is the number of observations (out of K observations) in the i-th state (see
D'Amico (2003) for the statistical properties of these estimators). Following the idea
of Iaquinta and Ortobelli (2006) we can compute the distribution function of the future gross returns. In particular, as shown by Angelelli and Ortobelli (2008), the
( N − 1)k + 1 dimensional vector p ( k ) (representing the unconditional distribution at a
given time k = 0,1,2,...,T of wealth Wk ( x) ) can be computed by means of a sequence

{ }

of matrixes Q ( k )

k = 0,1,..., T

, where Q ( k ) = [qi(,kj) ]1≤ i ≤ ( N −1) k +1 and qi(,kj) is the unconditional
1≤ j ≤ N

(i , k )

probability at time k to obtain the wealth w

and to be in the state z((xj)) . In particu-

lar, Q (0) = [ p1 ,..., pN ] , where pi is the unconditional probability to be in the i-th
state at time 0. Thus, p (0) = 1 = Q (0) ⋅ 1N , where 1N is the unity vector column. In
general, for k = 1,..., T , the vector p ( k ) is given by p ( k ) = Q ( k ) ⋅ 1N , where Q ( k ) is

recursively defined as Q ( k ) = diagM(Q ( k −1) ⋅ P ) being diagM a linear operator de( m + n −1)n

that at any m × n matrix
fined for any m, n ∈ N as diagM: R → R
A = [aij ] associates the (m + n − 1) × n matrix obtained by simply shifting down the
mn

j-th column by ( j − 1) rows (see Iaquinta and Ortobelli (2006), Angelelli and Ortobelli
(2008) for further details). The matrix Q ( k ) is the so called unconditional evolution
matrix of the Markov chain or simply evolution matrix. Moreover, the algorithm to
compute the probabilities has a computational complexity of O( N ³k ²) .
2.2 The Portfolio Selection Problem

The static portfolio selection problem when no short sales are allowed, can be represented as the maximization of the expected utility applied to the random portfolio of
gross returns z( x ), t +1 subject to the portfolio weights belonging to the n-dimensional
simplex

{

}

S = x ∈ R n | ∑ in=1xi = 1; xi ≥ 0 , i.e., max E (u ( z( x ), t +1 )) , for a given utility
x∈S

function u. This represents the classic myopic utility functional that does not use the
time evolution of the wealth process. In a dynamic context we consider an initial
wealth W0 = 1 and all admissible wealth processes W ( x) = {Wt ( x)}t ≥ 0 depending by
an initial portfolio x ∈ S are defined on a filtered probability space

( Ω, ℑ, ( ℑ )

t 0 ≤ t ≤∞

)

, P . In this case we can distinguish two cases: the case where the

investors recalibrate the portfolio at some given date T (European portfolio selection
strategies) and the case where the investors recalibrate the portfolio at some given
date t ≤ T if some particular events At ∈ ℑt happen (American portfolio selection
strategies). In this paper we deal only European portfolio selection strategies where
investors recalibrate their portfolio every T periods solving the problem:
max E ( u (WT ( x)) ) .

(2)

x∈S

According to Angelelli and Ortobelli (2008) definition we call OA expected utility the
above functional E (u (WT ( x))) when it is computed under the assumption that the
gross return of each portfolio follows a Markov chain with N states. The European
OA expected utility is given by

(

)

(

)

E (u (WT ( x))) = u WˆT ( x) ⋅ Q (T ) ⋅ 1N = u Wˆ ( x) ⋅ p (T ) ,

(3)

where WˆT ( x) = ⎡⎣ w((1,x )T ) ,..., w((xN) −1)T +1, T ) ⎤⎦ is the ( N − 1)T + 1 dimensional vector of the

(

)

final wealth and u WˆT ( x) = ⎡⎣u ( w((1,x )T ) ),..., u ( w((xN) −1)T +1, T ) ) ⎤⎦ . Since Angelelli and Ortobelli (2008) have shown that standard optimization algorithms are not adequately suited
to solve the global optimization problem (2) of OA expected utility, we use the same
optimization heuristic proposed by Angelelli and Ortobelli (2008) to solve portfolio
optimization problems. So, starting by an initial feasible portfolio solution x , the heuristic algorithm tries to iteratively update the current solution by a better one. Improving

592

solutions, if any, are searched on a predefined grid of points fixed on the directions
x − ei for i = 1, 2,..., n , where x is the current portfolio and ei is the portfolio where the
share of asset i is equal to 1 and all other assets have share equal to 0. If a better solution
is found on a search direction the current solution is updated and the search is continued
from the new one. If no direction provides an improved solution the search ends. Next,
we recall some empirical results provided by Angelelli and Ortobelli (2008), who tested
the performance of the optimization heuristic algorithm versus function fmincon provided with the optimization toolbox of MATLAB. The results are synthesized in Table

Table 1 underlines the limit of fmincon Matlab procedure to approximate a global
optimum when the functionals admit many local maxima. These results tell us that the
heuristic algorithm generally needs more computational time of fmincon Matlab
procedure. However, we have a significant improvement in terms of objective function and portfolio weights when we use the heuristic. Moreover, the heuristic well
approximates the optimum when this is unique; indeed there is just a little difference
with the myopic Sharpe functional in terms of values and portfolios. From the results
we deduce that the fmincon procedure can be used only for myopic strategies that
admit an unique optimum (such as the myopic Sharpe strategy). Thus, as suggested by
Angelelli and Ortobelli (2008), the main advantages of this algorithm are:
1) The algorithm permits to approximate the global optimum with a given error
when the objective function is a non-constant concave function (the optimum is
unique) and some particular lines are not contour lines of the objective function.
2) The algorithm permits to explore the whole simplex.
3) The computational complexity is much less than that of classic algorithms for
global optimum such as Simulated Annealing type algorithms.

An Ex-post Comparison among OA Portfolio Strategies Based
on the Maximum Expected Utility

In this section, we propose an ex post comparison among European OA expected
utility strategies and the myopic ones. In the empirical comparisons, we consider the
optimal allocation among 20 assets components of the Dow Jones Industrials1 on the
period from 1/3/1985 till 5/1/2008 for a total of 5884 daily observations. The work of
Kondor et al. (2007) on the sensitivity to estimation error of portfolios optimized
under various risk measures suggests that we need a large number of observations
when we want to propose portfolio models considering rare events. As a matter of
fact, Papp et al. (2005), Kondor et al. (2007) have shown that we could loose robustness of the approximations if the number of observations is not adequate to the number of assets. In addition, some empirical experiments show that, if we increase the
number of the states, we need an increasing number of observations. For this reason
we forecasted the future wealth using a non parametric Markov chain with only few
states N=3, N=5 states and K = 2000 historical observations. We assume investors
recalibrate the portfolio every T = 60 days starting from 1/3/1985. The comparison
consists in the ex post evaluation of the wealth produced by the strategies. We compare the performance of myopic and OA expected utility strategies based on the following HARA utility functions:
1) negative exponential utility function:
u (W ) = − exp(− aW ) ; with a=1, 5, 10, 15, 20.

2) power utility function:

u (W ) =

Wg
; with g=-1, -0.6, -0.2, 0.2, 0.6, 1, 1.4, 1.8, 2.2, 2.6, 3.

With myopic strategies the expected utility of each portfolio is approximated consid1 K

The output of this analysis is represented in Tables 2, 3, Fig. 1, and Fig. 2. Tables 2
and 3 show the ex-post final wealth at date 5/1/2008 obtained with myopic and Markovian strategies and maximizing expected power utility and expected negative exponential utility. We observe that always the Markovian strategies perform better than
myopic strategies. Moreover we also observe that we get better results using three
states. We believe that this fact can be justified by a more robust approximation of the
forecasted final wealth (see Papp et al. (2005), Kondor et al. (2007)). These results are
further confirmed by Fig. 1, and Fig. 2 that describe the ex post sample paths of final

wealth. Figures 1 and 2 show better performance of OA expected utility strategies
respectively for power utility with risk aversion parameter g= -0.2 and with negative
exponential utility with parameter a= 10.
This empirical comparison suggests the use of OA type strategies since with these
strategies we get in some cases even three times the final wealth we get with the
analogous myopic strategies.

4 Concluding Remarks
This paper analyzes the impact of Markovianity in optimal portfolio choices. We examine how to approximate non parametric Markov processes and we deal the computational complexity of these portfolio selection problems. Thus we propose algorithms
that permit to solve computationally complex problems in acceptable computational
times. Secondly, we propose an empirical comparison among the myopic portfolio
selection models and the Markovian ones. The ex-post empirical comparison among
classic approaches and those based on Markovian trees shows the greater predictable
capacity of the latter.
The contribution of this paper consists in the computational accessible methodology to solve dynamic expected utility portfolio problems.
