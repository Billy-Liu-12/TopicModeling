Abstract
This work presents a probabilistic model for the microscopic simulation of traÔ¨Éc roads based on Nagel-Schreckenberg‚Äôs
model. Each driver‚Äôs behavior is described through the combination of a continuous probability function with an anticipatory feature that leads to a counter Ô¨Çow velocity tunning. The simulations developed and described herein give
rise to a phase diagram which resembles and enriches the fundamental diagram, in its theoretical as well as for real
data.

1. Introduction
TraÔ¨Éc Ô¨Çow directly aÔ¨Äects the quality of life in modern societies. TraÔ¨Éc jams and their associated generation of
pollution, as well as their psychological eÔ¨Äects, are some of the reasons why a better understanding of traÔ¨Éc Ô¨Çow
has received so much attention in the last decades. In order to study and understand traÔ¨Éc Ô¨Çow‚Äôs characteristics,
many mathematical models, both macroscopic and microscopic, have been employed. Among them, Cellular Automata (CA) methods have been employed with good results, since the dynamics of the CA tries to closely mimic
the movement of all vehicles and their interaction. Thus CA models have been applied for managing, describing and
understanding traÔ¨Éc characteristics. In [1] a CA model was developed for studying diÔ¨Äerent strategies to control and
[2] describes the freeway traÔ¨Éc in North Rhine-Westphalia in a CA model, presenting on-line information about the
freeway. Employment of CA models in this context is recent and a fully satisfactory widely applicable model is yet
to be developed. Some of the main advantages of CA models are that they are easily implemented, lead to moderate
computational cost and keep the basic features of the phenomenon ([3], [4], [5]).
This work has two diÔ¨Äerent goals and contributions for approaching traÔ¨Éc highway through a cellular automata
model. The Ô¨Årst is to improve the Ô¨Çow-density relation, leading to a transition to jammed Ô¨Çow that closely resembles
real data. The second one introduces a time explicit feature to the model and position and velocity updates are
decoupled. In this work a probabilistic model, organized as two well deÔ¨Åned steps, with anticipatory features and

explicit in time, is proposed. Initially the model deÔ¨Ånes the vehicle‚Äôs velocities explicitly from the previous time step
conÔ¨Åguration. In the sequel an update step is performed. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the driver‚Äôs behavior is modeled according to a
continuous probability function. Moreover, during the determination of velocities, the counter Ô¨Çow velocity tunning
gives rise to a recursive procedure that provides the tunning of velocities. This is performed in such a way that
velocities are adjusted to appropriate values even in the event of a velocity reduction by a leading car.
This work is organized as follows: in Section 2 related work on cellular automata models applied to traÔ¨Éc highways is discussed; in Section 3 some concepts of traÔ¨Éc-Ô¨Çow theory are reviewed; Section 4 describes the proposed
algorithm; Section 5 presents some test cases. Concluding remarks about the proposed method are discussed in
Section 6.
2. Related work
The class of Cellular Automata models applied for traÔ¨Éc problems is divided in two well deÔ¨Åned sets, namely
deterministic and probabilistic models. Among the most widely known deterministic models are the Rule-184 [6]
and a modiÔ¨Åed version of Rule-184[7]. This latter introduces more velocity variations besides 0 and 1, which are
the values established by the rule-184, supporting up to 5 variation cell per unit time simulation. The random factor
introduced by the probabilistic models tries to properly represent the behavior of drivers, as well as to improve the
Ô¨Çow-density relation. Nagel and Schreckenberg [8] proposed the successful algorithm that has been widely employed,
became the basis for several developments and is referred to as NaSch model. NaSch follows simple basic rules: all
drivers attempt to drive in the maximum velocity allowed by the stream of vehicles or the road‚Äôs speed limit; a driver
shall keep the vehicle‚Äôs velocity or, without any apparent reason and with a small probability, simply reduce it. A
subsequent adjustment of each vehicle‚Äôs speed considers its distance to the one immediately ahead.
Slow-to-start models form a subset of the set of probabilistic models. Their main purpose is to represent the
driver‚Äôs eagerness for restoring his velocity when his vehicle is stopped, i.e., the inertia eÔ¨Äect of the vehicles. Although
slow-to-start models can represent the meta stability phase, drivers‚Äô conservative behavior leads to jammed Ô¨Çow with
lower density than empirical data indicate.
Among the slow-to-start, one has the following: models discussed in [9] and [10] consider the space ahead after
some simulation time, in order to restore the car‚Äôs velocity. In [11] and [12] the Ô¨Çow adjustment method deÔ¨Ånes that
a driver considers the space between vehicles ahead and adds the free space between them. The concept adopted in
such method is that every driver considers that its leading vehicle (that is, the one immediately ahead) will move in
the same velocity as in the previous time frame, thus a model with an anticipatory feature.
The anticipatory policy represents a level of expectancy that a vehicle has of its leader. It is given by the distance
between two vehicles plus the potential distance that the leader has for moving. The level of expectancy is quantiÔ¨Åed
by a randomness related with the velocity of the leading vehicle. The other rule of anticipation delineates the situation
when a (driver‚Äôs) vehicle has a high level of expectancy that its leader is going to keep its velocity at next time frame
and this does not happen.
3. TraÔ¨Éc-Flow Theory
The behavior of traÔ¨Éc is analysed here on the basis of a set of variables: density describes the number of vehicles
per unit length of a highway at some time (see Eq. 1) where n is the number of vehicles as well as L represents a part
of the highway.
n
œÅ=

L
The average velocity, i.e., the averaged sum of velocities, is established as (Eq. 2)

(2)

Flow is deÔ¨Åned as the number of vehicles that pass by a speciÔ¨Åc point of the highway per unit time, as in Eq. 3

The equations, as described previously, show how to compute the variables at a particular time. However, when
one tries to simulate realistic scenarios, many time steps should be used in order for the complexity of the phenomena
to emerge. Thus, the equations shall be re-written for greater adequacy, as in Eq. 5, where m is the number of vehicles
that pass at a highway section and T is a time period.

Moreover, the average velocity is re-written, so as to consider the vehicles that pass at a highway section, as in
Eq.6.

The equations above represent the behavior of traÔ¨Éc Ô¨Çow on a highway by means of vehicle counts over long periods
of time. Typically, the analysis of traÔ¨Éc Ô¨Çow is performed by constructing the corresponding fundamental diagram.
This depicts how Ô¨Çow and density relate. The theoretical model is illustrated in Fig. 1 and real data is presented in
Fig. 2.

Figure 1: Theoretical fundamental diagram

Figure 2: Real data fundamental diagram

The fundamental diagram exhibits three well deÔ¨Åned phases, namely: the Ô¨Årst one represents the free-Ô¨Çow and
corresponds to the region of low to medium density and weak interaction between vehicles. In this phase, the vehicles
can move almost at the highway‚Äôs speed limit, and the Ô¨Çow increases linearly with increasing density, density ranging
in 0 ‚â§ œÅ ‚â§ c1 . The second phase presents medium and high density, the Ô¨Çow shall behave either free or jammed, i.e.,
the phase c1 < œÅ < c2 shows a Ô¨Çow that is not deÔ¨Åned only by density, but by the interaction between the vehicles
instead. This phase is named the metastable phase. The last phase is œÅ > c2 , and represents the jammed Ô¨Çow, where
an increase in density forces a decrease in the Ô¨Çow.
Therefore, usable models have to represent both qualitatively (mandatory) as well as quantitatively (desirable) the
fundamental diagram, making it possible for a coherent analysis of all variables involved in the process to be carried
on.

4. The Probabilistic Model
In this section, NaSch‚Äôs model is brieÔ¨Çy reviewed, and its algorithmic description, Algorithm 1, provides a framework for the presentation of the new probabilistic model, which is based on NaSch‚Äôs model and extends the anticipatory concept proposed by [12].
4.1. Nasch‚Äôs Model
The set up and discretization used by NaSch‚Äôs model is depicted as follows. The variables space and time are both
discrete so t ‚àà N, xit ‚àà Z; The highway is considered with periodic boundary condition, i.e., the position X is the same
as position X + L where L is the length of the circuit. Likewise, the ith vehicle is the same as the (i + N)th vehicle,
where N is the number of vehicles.
Each cell represents a length space of 7.5 meters and the time evolution scale is measured in seconds. Besides,
the variable (vti ) denotes the velocity of ith vehicle in the time instant t, in cells per time, while xit denotes the spatial
position. The distance between two vehicles in a time instant is represented by dit , and the maximum speed permitted
is given by vmax .
The probabilistic character of the model is represented by p and pm . The Ô¨Årst is chosen from an uniform distribution and the latter is an initial parameter. They represent the probability for a vehicle to preserve its speed at the next
time instant t + 1.

4.2. The Proposed Model
The model proposed herein is described by algorithms 2 and 3. The algorithm is explicit in time and its aim is to
ensure the correct velocity deÔ¨Ånition of each vehicle, in order to prevent a cell of CA to be occupied by more than one
vehicle, what would characterize an unreal collision (unreal stands for the fact that eÔ¨Äective collisions are left out of
the model, since one here considers the driver would avoid it by braking more intensely).
The proposed model has two separate stages. In the Ô¨Årst, velocities are deÔ¨Åned while, in the second, positions for
all vehicles are updated. The former is described by lines 2 ‚àí 14 and the latter is treated by line 17, both of algorithm
3. Velocity deÔ¨Ånition and position updating are independent tasks. Moreover, they are not tied to the Ô¨Çow direction of
the simulation, thus allowing free choice of access to the data structure.

The algorithm 3 is part of Alg. 2 and is responsible for executing the explicit procedure of reverse adjustment
of velocity. This procedure is invoked whenever a vehicle reduces its velocity unexpectedly, forcing the algorithm to
redeÔ¨Åne the velocities of vehicles aÔ¨Äected by this fact.

The anticipatory procedure adopted employs the concept of eÔ¨Äective distance (dist ). It considers the distance
between two vehicles increased by an expectation term. This term is an expectation level of how much the next
vehicle will move analysing its velocity in the previous time instant. It is described by lines 8 and 3 of algorithms 2
and 3, respectively.

The expression is composed by two parts: the Ô¨Årst is the distance from the ith vehicle to its follower (i + 1)th, the
second is the velocity of (i + 1)th vehicle. This is shown by Fig. 4, where one veriÔ¨Åes that the leading vehicle is not
going to change its velocity at next time instant with probability Œ± ‚àà [0..1]. The parameter Œ± stands for the uncertainty
that one vehicle will keep its velocity from the previous time instant to the one under computation. It is modeled by a
continuous probability function and its choices are implemented based on a Monte Carlo rejection process.

Figure 5: Cluster of vehicles

The rule of explicit reverse adjustment of velocity, in order to avoid unrealistic collision whenever the ith vehicle
does not move what is expected or the ith velocity is not the same as in the previous instant, the vehicle signalizes
for its follower this fact. It has its velocity re-adjusted and an iterative update procedure is enabled until there are no
vehicles aÔ¨Äected by such velocity reduction. This set of vehicles is called the inÔ¨Çuence cluster and illustrated by Fig.
5.
In order to evaluate the number of vehicles that are inÔ¨Çuenced and have their velocities re-adjusted, the following
procedure is adopted:
‚Ä¢ Consider the ith vehicle is to be analyzed. One deÔ¨Ånes how many cells the previous vehicle expects it to move,
i.e., Œ±i vt‚àí1
0, i.e., Œ±i = li the minimum value of Œ± 0 and f (Œ±) is a probability
i . Where Œ±i = min(Œ±), ‚àÄ f (Œ±)
distribution function modeling the driver‚Äôs behavior. This is illustrated in Fig. 6;
‚Ä¢ When this vehicle signalizes to the previous, through the expression Œ±vt‚àí1
> dist , an iterative process is enabled
i
and repeated until all inÔ¨Çuenced vehicles have their velocities updated.
The procedure described above is applied when the condition Œ±i vt‚àí1
> dis holds. This is used to restrict the
i
number of vehicles that need to have their velocities updated. It divides the highway in clusters, so that the algorithm
can separate the vehicles in inÔ¨Çuence regions, i.e., these regions are composed by clusters of vehicles that will be
aÔ¨Äected by sudden changes in vehicles‚Äô velocities.
The cluster is identiÔ¨Åed by collecting cluster members along the direction opposing the Ô¨Çow. One begins with a
vehicle that does not update its velocity until the vehicle that is not aÔ¨Äected by the decrease of the velocities of the
vehicles belonging to the cluster, i.e., until the expression vti ‚â§ dit‚àí1 turns out to be true. Additionally, the signalization
process may be propagated as any vehicle in the cluster may move with a velocity which diÔ¨Äers from the one it was
expected to. This will result in the creation of subclusters inside the main cluster. This is computationally treated by
using a recursive strategy. In a cluster where one vehicle does not move as expected, the iterative procedure is applied
within all cluster and its subclusters.
4.3. An Approach based on Continuous Probability and The Rejection Technique
In the model presented herein a novel policy for anticipation is proposed. Namely, instead of using Ô¨Åxed probabilities to describe average behavior on highways, a continuous probability function is employed.

The new approach for the probability distribution function proposed in this work represents a more Ô¨Çexible and
realistic model for the representation of highway diversity of behavioral responses. Here, the normal probability
distribution function is adopted for its convenience and ease of use.
The rejection technique is an essential part of the technique presented herein. It shall be described by algorithm 4:

Figure 6: The Monte Carlo rejection technique

This work uses a Monte Carlo rejection technique as illustrated in Fig. 6. The procedure is eÔ¨Äective both for
discrete as well as continuous probability distribution functions.
5. Testing and Results
The set up conditions for simulation are the same as those employed by Nagel and Schreckenberg‚Äôs work [8].
Therefore, preliminary tests are performed with circular highways, under periodic boundary condition, with 300 cells.
The simulations were carried out using highway densities ranging from 0.01 up to 0.99, and evolving for 10000
time units. The results for the Ô¨Årst 1000 units were discarded since transient eÔ¨Äects are not the target. Thus, after
the simulation evolves for some time steps/units, the long range collective eÔ¨Äects which arise from the short term
interactions emerge and prevail during the long term operation of the highway.
The average value represents the average speed of the highway, subjected to the maximum allowed value of 5 cells
5
per unit time. Furthermore, the average and standard deviation values must be in the range such that 1 f (x, Œº, œÉ) dx =
1 is ensured.
The fundamental diagram is represented by Fig 7 for some values for the uncertainty on a car keeping its speed.
Among the exhibitted results for the pm values, pm = 0.25 closely resembles real data.
Fig. 8 illustrates diÔ¨Äerent values for averages that describe the Ô¨Çow for several levels of expectation of anticipation.
For the set of parameters pm = 0.25 , Œº = 3.0 and œÉ = 0.25, the simulated data provide very good agreement with
real data.
6. Conclusion
In this work a probabilistic model based on Nagel-Schreckenberg‚Äôs model is presented. Besides, each driver‚Äôs
behavior is described through the combination of a continuous probability function and counter Ô¨Çow velocity tunning.

Drivers‚Äô behavior may be, in a Ô¨Årst attempt, modelled by a uniform distribution. However, some drivers behave more
aggressively than others. Thus, the normal distribution is a more appropriate description. Indeed, some drivers behave
more aggressively than others. Moreover, the leading vehicle will very often keep its velocity in the next time instants.
however, when a vehicle reduces its velocity, as in the real world, it should be indicated for the trailing ones.
The model proposed in this work requires few parameters to set up a simulation. Despite being an explicit method,
it is stable. This is due to the fact that the recursive cluster self adjustment method always converges because of the
updating sequence. The simulations developed and described herein give rise to a phase diagram which resembles
and enriches the fundamental diagram, in its empirical as well as theoretical versions.
Summarizing, the method proposed herein is a fast procedure which appears to appropriately capture the essential
features of the real problem, since the phase diagrams become very similar, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively,
to empirical data.
