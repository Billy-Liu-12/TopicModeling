Abstract
Natural or man-made disasters cause damage to life and property. Lack of appropriate emergency
management increases the physical damage and loss of life. D-Aid, the smartphone App proposed by
this article, intends to help volunteers and relief teams to quickly map and aid victims of a disaster.
Anyone can put an occurrence after a disaster on a web map streamlining and decentralizing the
information access. Through visualization techniques like heat maps and voronoi diagrams on a map
implemented in the D-Aid app and also on a web map everyone can easily get information about
amount of victims, their necessities and eminent dangers after disasters.
Keywords: Application Software, disasters, Voronoi Diagrams, Heat Maps.

1 Introduction
A disaster is a sudden, calamitous event that seriously disrupts the functioning of a community or
society and causes human, material, and economic or environmental losses that exceed the
community’s or society’s ability to cope using its own resources [1]. Preparing for a disaster can
reduce the fear, anxiety and losses that disasters cause. Phenomena like earthquakes, landslides,
volcanic eruptions, floods, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural disasters that
kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. Examples of
man-made disasters include stampedes, fires, transport and industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear
radiation, war and terrorism attack. Communication is one of the key issues during any emergency.
Pre-planning of communications is critical to minimize the consequent hazard, vulnerability and to
rescue victims.
D-Aid, smartphone App proposed here, can be an efficient emergency communication system in a
disaster. Victims or volunteers can register occurrences of disasters and exchange this information
among themselves as well as with the relief teams. To make it more specific, we use a hypothetical
example. If a person has suffered an injury in a given street, he/she registers that occurrence in D-Aid
on the city map, so everybody connected can know about it. Likewise, each one also registers his/her

occurrences, and this way, all population is up-to-date about what is going on in the place of disaster.
In this case volunteers and relief teams can quickly aid victims. Relief activities include rescue,
relocation, providing food and water, preventing disease and disability, repairing vital services such as
telecommunications and transport, providing temporary shelter and emergency health care.
Occurrences can be categorized as slight injury, serious injury, unconscious person, burns, drowning,
person without mobility, etc.
D-Aid has also a visualization system to integrate weighted data of occurrences. Thus it can be
defined areas of priority to relieve. For example, areas with more people to aid or eminent hazard are
areas painted with red color and areas with less injured people are painted with blue color.
Some web-tools or Apps [2], [3], [4], [5] have been built to allow the citizens to have the right to
access public information. Usually, these systems allow registering events related to the cities
categories: environment, entrepreneurship, urban mobility, technology, culture, sports and leisure,
wealth and wellness, education, safety, citizenship, urbanism, violence, tourism. Each recorded event
is visualized in a city map by an icon which represents the category. Following this same line of
collective intelligence we proposed D-Aid which allows human communities evolve towards higher
order of complexity through data differentiation and integration and collaboration. D-Aid provides an
improvement over these cited tools on the visualization front.

2 D-Aid App
D-Aid App is a smartphone application that allows the mapping of disasters through the
geographically register of occurrences by victims (Figure 1). This service enables a realistic and
coordinated planning to increase the overall effectiveness of saving maximum lives and livelihoods
during any disaster situation. With D-Aid, victims and volunteers can easily register occurrences and
take information about the situation of a disaster. The registration is constituted by system of tabs to
the easy and quick classification of occurrences. The visualization mode is where all the information
fed by users is integrated, to be shown in a simple way. Doing so, we propose a new method to
visualize occurrences, using Voronoi diagrams to define densities of occurrences defined over
geographic areas. Through this system, victims and volunteers record and view relevant issues related
to disasters as amount of occurrences by region and their gravity.
Clicking on the map at the point where the occurrence to be registered happened, an optionwindow
opens and the victim or volunteer can quickly choose the type of occurrence. The event is classified by
categories: slight injury, serious injury, unconscious person, burns, drowning, personal without
mobility, collapsing buildings and others. The subtype is the affected part that is classified in order to
help the relief team to be prepared to attendance. People of disaster areas are encouraged to preregister their own data on D-Aid. Data like gender, age, blood type will help the relief teams to act
quickly. By the integration of the registered events it is possible to have a global view of the city
situation, as a whole or restricted to certain regions. It can be seen if a region is more affected than
other or if a region has a critical state. D-Aid became a tool of quick and efficient mobilization of
victims and relief teams towards a better management. The visualization of the occurrences integration
is showing in Figure 2. It presents levels of occurrences in predefined regions by colors. In that figure,
the city is divided in neighborhoods, and the occurrence events are counted in accordance with their
limits. The administrator defines the range limit to change the color of the region. The red color is
defined for a high level of occurrences in this neighborhood and the blue color for a low level. System
administrator also defines the weight for occurrences. For example, death risk has a higher weight
instead of a small injury.

We consider each of the registered occurrence k and its weight as a site for a polygon ܲ௞ of a
Voronoi decomposition k = 1, … , K of the visualized ambient, under the Euclidean metric. From the
general properties of Voronoi diagrams, we have that for higher occurrences concentrations we have
smaller Voronoi polygons. So, the area ‫ܣ‬௞ is a good quantifier for establishing the concentrations of a
specific type of occurrence, leading to a natural delimitation of the levels of these occurrences. The
method is detailed hereinafter.
In order to create regions where it is not necessary to depend on predefined divisions we choose
the Voronoi Diagrams technique to create regions according their densities. In [6] there are referenced
methods for creating districts, methods that depend on a current division arrangement and methods
that do not depend on current divisions. Our interest is in the second category of methods less
common. We choose the Voronoi Diagrams method because it provides the following features that are
very important for our visualization: The Voronoi diagram for a given set of generator points is unique
and produces polygons, which are path connected.
The nearest generator point to ‫݌‬௞ determines an edge of V(‫݌‬௞ ). The polygonal lines of a Voronoi
polygon do not intersect the generator points. When working in the Euclidean metric, all regions are
convex. The Voronoi diagram, exemplified in Figure 3 is defined by a set of sites {‫݌‬௞ }, k = 1, …, K
that divides a region in opened or closed sub-regions V(‫݌‬௞ ) that points minimizes the distance to the
respective sites, usually according to the Euclidean metric. In this case, the geometric representation of

Voronoi diagram is a set of polygons, called Voronoi polygons, formed by the K generator points (the
sites) contained plane, the sites.
Quadtree is associated to spatial decomposition in quadrants and each node contains at most four
children. In Voronoi diagrams it represents a rectangular region that includes the entire diagram. The
rectangular space is then divided into quadrants which are always divided into four parts as the new
points are added. A quaternary tree structure provides a simple way to cover the area that contains the
Voronoi diagram.

Figure 3. Visualization of regions formed by density of occurrences.

After generating the Voronoi diagram it is necessary to calculate the area of each created polygon.
That will set the concentration of the area, in other words will determine if there are many occurrences
in the region or few through the size of the area (Figure 3).
To visualize the occurrence concentrations we use the areas of Voronoi polygons of the
decomposition defined by the occurrences as a measure for color intensity C as well as for transparent
T. For the reason of simplicity and illustration, here we use red, since it represents the high
concentration of occurrences.
As each occurrence register is associated to one polygon generated from the Voronoi diagram, the
smaller the total area of the polygon closer occurrences of the same kind exists. Therefore, having
smaller areas means that the region around has many occurrences, or in other words, that kind of
occurrence is denser. Otherwise, greater areas mean few occurrences in that region. To calculate the
area ‫ܣ‬௞ of a Voronoi polygon ܲ௞ it uses the following equation.

where n(k) is the number of vertices of the polygon ܲ௞ ǡ ‫ݔ‬௜௞  is the coordinate latitude and ‫ݕ‬௜௞ is the
longitude of the vertex. In a sense, it is summed the distance for all vertex from ܲ௞ . The area size is

This work presents a heat map based on the definition of gradients in each of the markers to be
inserted in the data presentation layer. In this type of heat map, the location of each marker i from
location Pi on the map is associated to a function (6),

Gaussian, or even an affine function related to | x - Pi |.

intensity depends on the amount of markers inserted on the map. Thus, when new markers are been
added, the heat map is recalculated with new color intensities and the based on the interpolation of
near markers.

3 Conclusion
Regional and international organizations are all involved in mounting a humanitarian response to
disasters. Each one will have a prepared disaster management plan. These plans cover prevention,
preparedness, relief and recovery. Risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation
plans, environmental planning and design standards.
D-Aid is a tool to help relief and rescue teams to visualize and map all occurrences after a disaster.
It is a quickly way to victims inform their location, injuries and necessities. We used Voronoi
Diagrams and Heat Maps techniques to integrate and visualize data in a disaster map. We believe that
for an efficient use of D-Aid, preparedness and training is the main way of reducing the impact of
disasters. People need to have the app pre-installed and communications problems preventing usage
need to be tested and solved.
