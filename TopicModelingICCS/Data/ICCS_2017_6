conceptual approaches represented by the state-of-art research in tumor modeling. So called,
“multiscale modeling” (still very fashionable term and often overused), which tries to follow intrinsic
complexity of cancer phenomenon across many spatio-temporal scales, can be a way to nowhere
having in mind its direct application in clinical medicine. Consequently, by bridging many nonlinearly coupled scales and scores of accompanying biological phenomena, the multi-scale cancer
models become simultaneously: ill conditioned, overfitted and irreducible computationally. Moreover,
due to the continuous and partly chaotic evolution of cancer, we will never know, which tumor
growth/regression factors (microscopic, macroscopic, internal and external ones) trigger its dynamics,
and which are omitted or yet unknown. For these reasons, multi-scale models can have only a
cognitive value. In fact, cancer dynamics scenario is very individual and should be considered on a
case by case basis, considering real initial and current tumor proliferation conditions, which can be
changed anytime in an unpredictable way. The same problems are encountered in many complex
phenomena including weather forecast and climate prediction.
Therefore, to employ computer simulation for elaborating prognoses of cancer dynamics, one can
apply a very intuitive prediction/correction scheme, such as that exploited in weather forecast and
climate modeling, but built around a computer model of tumor. This way numerical simulations could
be continually verified by incoming data and reinforced by data models. The principal question arises:
What kind of tumor model should be used as the simulation engine? Seemingly, such the model
should be as accurate as possible, following all known micro and macroscopic processes influencing
tumor dynamics. However, as we have argued above, such the multi-scale tumor models can not be
useful in a clinical practice due to their intrinsic complexity. On the other hand, all the reported
single-scale models have pros and cons and their quality highly depends on the particular situation
they simulate. One of the intuitive issue is to develop a framework generating a set of tumor models,
which could be then selected and matched to the current stage of the real tumor evolution.
As shown in (Lima et al. 2016), there exist a general continuous approach that exploits mixturetheory representations of tissue behavior (Rajagopal and Tao, 1995) while accounting for a range of
relevant biological factors. It yields many potentially predictive cancer models. Lima et al. show that,
a proper tumor model, approximating observed growth pattern, could be selected on the basis of the
Occam Plausibility Algorithm (OPAL) platform. OPAL is able to assist in this selection from a
defined set of models of various complexity. The models can be fitted to current data by using
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme (Toni et al., 2009). However, the problems with
real data adaptation and matching scores of parameters for all inspected tumor models, simultaneously
taking into account their high spatio-temporal variability in 3-D, make this approach very demanding
computationally. Much simpler approach is in a great demand. To face with this challenge, we
propose in (Dzwinel et al. 2016; Kłusek et al., 2016) the supermodeling technique for computer
simulation of melanoma dynamics. The supermodel represents the coupled dynamical system
(Hiemstra et al., 2012). It consists of a few numerically linked instances of the same or various
computer models (sub-models). The sub-models synchronize their spatio-temporal behaviors, which
allow for penetrating phase space domains unreachable for a single sub-model. In (Dzwinel et al.,
2016) we present the supermodel of melanoma cancer. We demonstrated that by coupling three
instances of the same melanoma model, one can control the scenario of tumor growth by selecting a
small number of coefficients representing coupling strength between the sub-models.
In this position paper we summarize our previous findings and we formulate a concept of
prediction/correction scheme based on supermodeling technique, which could be used in the future as a
prognostic tool in the personalized anti-cancer therapy. We describe its main components and we discuss
the problems of its realization. The success of the proposed approach is seriously constrained by the high
computational complexity of cancer models. It is determined by the realistic size of tumor and the high
resolution of computational grid, which is necessary to follow fine-grained spatio-temporal dynamics of
cancer. That is why we have to consider the computational aspects of this system such as the

computational complexity of tumor model, its numerical realization and computer implementation.
Therefore, we will mention and comment here also the problems of:
 defining a generic coarse-grained computer model of cancer, which can be used as a computational
framework for developing high quality supermodels;
 developing a numerical engine, which will be fast enough to follow reverse optimization
computations, which has to be performed during each learning phase;
 implementation issues.

2 Supermodel
Similarly to weather and climate supermodels (van den Berge et al.,2006 ; Mirchev et al., 2012),
we define the cancer supermodel as an ensemble of a few (μ=1,...,M) instances (the sub-models) of a
generic tumor model. This generic model can be described by a set of parabolic partial differential
equations:
𝑖𝑖
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜇𝜇

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

= 𝑓𝑓𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 (∆𝑥𝑥𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 , 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡𝑡

(1)

where xμ =(xμ1,..., xμm) is the state vector with m dynamical system variables, Δ is a spatial operator
and μ is the number of sub-models. We define the coupling tensor C={Ciμv}where Ciμv are the
coupling coefficients between sub-models μ and v for a dynamical variable xi such that:
𝑖𝑖
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜇𝜇

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

= 𝑓𝑓𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 (∆𝑥𝑥𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 , 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 , 𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑡 ∑𝑣𝑣 𝐶𝐶𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇 ∙ (𝑥𝑥𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 ).

(2)

The supermodel evolution xsumo with time t is described by the ensemble average, i.e.:
�

𝒙𝒙sumo �C, 𝑡𝑡� ≡

𝑚𝑚

∑𝜇𝜇 𝒙𝒙𝜇𝜇 �C, 𝑡𝑡�.

(3)

The quality of synchronization between μ and v sub-models can be defined as the average of squared
distances between corresponding points of μ and v trajectories (see (Duane, 2009; Duane et al., 2006;
Mirchev et al., 2012)). The C tensor coefficients can be learned from the “ground truth” vector xgt
(repesented by the real or artificial data) by minimizing a squared error E(C):

in K subsequent timesteps ∆t, where γt (γ(0,1)) is a discount factor responsible for decreasing the
contribution of internal error increase. To illustrate the supermodeling concept, we present in Fig.1 a toy
supermodel, which consists of three coupled various “incomplete Lorentz systems”. As shown in Fig.1a,
it can reproduce the original Lorenz strange attractor for selected coupling coefficients.
On the basis of this supermodeling definition, the results of SUMO FET project
(http://projects.knmi.nl/sumo/) clearly show that by coupling a few climate models one can obtain more
accurate results than those they produce separately. What is even more impressing, Yang, et al., (2006)
and van den Berge, et al., (2011) demonstrated that the supermodel was able to follow global warming
effect not present in the sub-models but reflected by data used for learning the coupling coefficients.
Nevertheless, as shown in (Yang, et al., 2006; van den Berge, et al., 2011), many fundamental problems
are still opened, e.g., the lack of both a proper definition of the reliable supermodel and the formal
methods of its creation.
As shown in (Duane et al., 2006; Yang, et al., 2006; van den Berge, et al., 2011), not all dynamical
system variables have to be coupled, what is particularly important in the context of a prognostic system
implementability, mainly, in terms of its computational complexity. Therefore, we postulate that the
number of coupling coefficients has to be substantially smaller than the number of model parameters.

	

Witold Dzwinel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1832–1841

Simultaneously, we assume that the choice of the model parameter set Sμ can be done only once, on the
basis of very general premises (e.g. S1-6 in Fig.1b). These inaccurate and rule-of-thumb based values of
parameters can be treated as “imperfections” in sub-models. The “exact” parameters adaptation is
unrealistic anyway, due to confounding uncertainties: in observational data ... in model selection, and
in the features targeted in the prediction (Lima et al. 2016). Also other model inaccuracies resulting
from: the lack of some components of unknown fine-grained phenomena, the model initial conditions
different than the real ones as well as the truncation and round-off errors, are “corrected” by the
procedure of the supermodel data adaptation. Such the “corrections” can be valid on a longer time-scale
giving acceptable predictions (Yang, et al., 2006; van den Berge, et al., 2011). This suggests that the finegrained features and other unpredictable events accompanying cancer dynamics and not included in the
tumor model can be hidden in data. From the point of view of machine learning, the formal
mathematical framework plays the role of an additional knowledge, which defines more precisely the
feature space topology. The synchronization of the supermodel with real data can be achieved by
employing a prediction/correction learning scheme focused on fitting several values of coupling
coefficients C between sub-models, instead of matching scores of tumor model parameters S0, as it is in
the classical data adaptation techniques used for multi-scale models. This advantage of supermodeling
over multi-scale approach in terms of data adaptation is depicted in Fig.1b.

3 Melanoma supermodel and prognostic system
In (Dzwinel et al., 2016 and Kłusek et al. 2016) we adopt supercomputing idea in simulation of
melanoma skin cancer, which belongs to the most aggressive and malignant tumors (Manning, 2013).
Unlike “a general” tumor model, frequently referenced as a metaphor of tumor (Chaplain et al., 2006),
melanoma proliferates in a computationally complex environment. It grows on the skin surface and
invades its subsequent layers of various mechanical and physical properties (see Fig.3a). Moreover, as
shown in Fig.2, the vascular network in skin differs considerably from that in a homogeneous tissue.
This structured vascular network requires developing heterogeneous continuum/discrete numerical
models. Apart from continuous concentration fields we have to simulate remodeling process of discrete
blood vasculature. For simulation of realistic situations, the computational layout should be
reconstructed from, e.g., CT images (such as in (Lima et al. 2016)).

Figure 2: The initial multi-layer layout (a) and vascular network (b) used in modeling of melanoma dynamics. The vascular
network generated for a homogeneous tissue (c) is depicted for comparison (Łazarz, 2017).

In (Dzwinel et al., 2016) we describe in details our “generic” melanoma model. It represents a singlephase continuum tumor model (Vittorio and Lowengrub, 2010) and is based on models presented earlier
in (Chaplain et al., 2006; Ramis-Conde et al., 2008; Welter and Rieger, 2010). It is described by means
of mainly diffusion-reaction parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) coupled by algebraic
constitutive relations (Dzwinel et al., 2016). The numerical integration of PDEs simulates spatiotemporal evolution of concentration fields xμ=(xμ1,..., xμm). We use m=7 dynamical variables
representing concentrations of: tumor cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), endothelial cells, tumor
angiogenic factors (TAF), oxygen, fibronectin, and enzymes influencing ECM degradation. The
additional discrete model simulates the process of vascular remodeling (Łoś et al., 2016; Łazarz, 2016).
Our model neglects many microscopic and discrete cancer growth factors. Particularly, in the
context of melanoma growth, the mechanical properties of skin layers and biological processes resulting
in the sudden deep vertical growth of tumor (such as Langerhans mechanism (Clausen and Grabbe,
2015)) are neglected. Various skin layers differ only in values of diffusion coefficients and the
vascularization displayed in Fig.2. The model uses 30 free parameters, which approximate values were
taken from (Chaplain et al., 2006; Ramis-Conde et al., 2008; Welter and Rieger, 2010) and are collected
in our recent paper (Kłusek et al. 2016). The supermodel of melanoma progression (Dzwinel et al.,
2016) was made of three sub-models. They differ in one or a few parameters which control the cancer
growth speed such as: interaction between degraded extracellular matrix and cancer cells, pressure and
diffusion coefficient of tumor cells. The spatio-temporal cancer cells concentration field xμtc(r,t) (rposition, t - time, μ- the sub-model index) is the most important variable in modeling of tumor dynamics.
Therefore, we have decided to couple the sub-models only via this variable. Thus according to Eqs.
(2,3), we have:

where J1,2,3 are the tumor cell fluxes in corresponding sub-models (1,2,3), b+1,2,3 and b-1,2,3 are the sources
(birth) and sinks (death) terms, respectively. The full set of equations one can find in (Dzwinel et al.,
2016). The rest of the model equations are identical in the three sub-models.
We demonstrated in (Dzwinel et al., 2016; Kłusek et. al., 2016) that depending on values of the
coupling coefficients we can obtain all recognized melanoma growth scenarios. In (Kłusek et al., 2016)
we show that for thicker melanoma we are able to simulate the development of massive necrotic core in

	

Witold Dzwinel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1832–1841

the neoplasm center. This result correlates well with the real observation that ulceration occurs more
frequently in thick tumors. The exemplary results from our simulations are displayed in Fig.3.

corresponds to the highest tumor density while the black one shows necrotic spots. The timings for 2∙103 timesteps for
AWESUMM and our explicit solver are compared.

Our melanoma model is consistent with single-phase models, which can be generated within the
OPAL framework (Lima et al. 2016). More simple models can also be constructed and then matched to
the current tumor growth scenario, automatically calibrated and validated by incoming data (Lima et al.
2016). However, the maximum number of dynamic variables in OPAL is m=14 what allows for
developing also more complex two-phase models. Because the OPAL framework allows for constructing
many classes of tumor models, we find it extremely useful in selecting a candidate set of the most
parsimonious “generic” tumor models. They could be further used as the sub-models for constructing the
most reliable and computationally efficient supermodel for considered tumor type and its growth stage.
The ABC Bayesian approach, used in OPAL for model calibration, could be directly exploited in
learning coupling coefficients in supermodels.
The melanoma model was implemented by using standard FDM (finite difference method) and the
Euler numerical scheme. The computational box is discretized on 250x250x150 grid, which represents
5mmx5mmx4mm fragment of skin. The numerical model was implemented in C++ in CUDA
environment on the ZEUS GPGPU cluster (ACK CYFRONET, Kraków) equipped with 20
computational nodes. Each of node consists of two Intel Xeon X5645 (6 cores), 96 GB RAM and 8
Nvidia®TeslaTM M2090 (512 cores, 6GB GDDR5) boards. For a single and longer simulation we have
used only one CPU with 4 GPUs attached. For the short tests we have employed a stand-alone server
with a single CPU boosted by 4 GPU processors. In both cases, three GPUs were used for calculations
of concentration fields while the fourth one for blood flow calculation. The simulation snapshots were
visualized by using ParaViewTM visualization interface. The computational time for a single simulation,
allowing for the growth of tumor of the size of the computational box, is about 1 hour (2∙105 timesteps)
(see Fig.3 for timings). This is much better than other more sophisticated solvers (Fig.3) but still

1837

1838	

Witold Dzwinel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1832–1841

unsatisfactory, having in mind that the coupling coefficients have to be learned from data. The learning
phase will be, in fact, the reverse optimization task, minimizing the weighted squared error E(C) from
Eq.(4). Therefore, we expect that the model has to be run many times. Moreover, to employ the
supermodeling for predicting realistic tumor sizes (a few centimeters in the case of melanoma) and
taking into account its internal dynamics in an adequate precision, the computational time should be
decreased at least one-two orders of magnitude. This can be achieved by using novel multi-scale
numerical engines, allowing for dynamic mesh adaptation.

Figure 4: Initialization of the prediction/correction scheme for melanoma prognostic system.

Figure 5: Prediction/correction loop step for melanoma prognostic system.

To this end, we have tested adaptive numerical framework AWESUMM (Adaptive Wavelet
Environment for in Silico Universal Multiscale Modeling) based on second-generation wavelet
collocation method invented by Vasilyev et al. (2005). We have employed its recent implementation
which is used for complex multi-scale CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations such as
combustion phenomenon (Regele et al., 2016). However, despite this code is parallel, uses MPI
interface and can be run on multiprocessor servers, it cannot beat very efficient GPU implementation of
our direct FDM solver. Moreover, it appeared that the collocation method cannot tackle the problem of
discontinuity of density fields (of oxygen and TAF - tumor angiogenic factors), generated by the
complex topology of the vascular network. We believe that the application of a new isogeometric
method (rIGA – refined Isogeometric Analysis) implemented in GPU environment, which is now tested
on 2D tumor model, will considerably improve the efficiency of the melanoma model. On the base of

	

Witold Dzwinel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1832–1841

preliminary results (Łoś et al., 2016) we estimate that the computational time of tumor simulation can be
reduced at least one order of magnitude in comparison with our FDM model.
In Fig.4 and Fig.5 we present the block schemes demonstrating a general idea of the melanoma
prognostic system based on the supermodeling approach. It consists of two phases: initialization and
control. During the initialization phase, the 3-D image of melanoma, obtained by using advanced
imaging techniques such as Optical Projection Tomography, is pre-processed to reconstruct early pretumor tissue (see Fig.4). This reconstruction would be further used as the layout for supermodeling. The
coupling coefficients C are learned in the prediction/correction loop by minimizing the E(C) error (see
Eq.(4)) between cancer cell concentration fields from the real image and produced by the model. It can
be done in a similar way as it is in the OPAL framework (Lima et. al 2016) by using ABC scheme (Toni
et al., 2009). If the error appears satisfactory, i.e., less than a given tolerance T, one can simulate and
observe cancer proliferation scenario and estimate its growth rate. On the basis of these results, an
oncologist can plan a proper drug treatment by manipulating the model parameters responsible for drug
delivery, function and activity. This way, various treatment scenarios can be checked and the best one –
e.g., resulting in cancer remission – can be finally chosen. Whereas, in the control phases shown in
Fig.5, the simulations go with diagnostic checkpoints from one checkpoint to another, following the
prediction/correction loop briefly described above.
This prediction/correction system is very similar to that used in numerical weather forecast systems
(see e.g. (Fischer et al., 2005)). However, the most important difference is that the pressure and
temperature fields can be directly measured, while the methods of medical imaging, which would be
able to display 3D concentration fields of tumor cells, oxygen, TAF and the structure of vascular
network, are still very much in its infancy.

4 Conclusions and discussion
In this position paper we postulate that it is possible to obtain reliable prognoses about cancer
dynamics by creating the supermodel of cancer, which consists of a few coupled instances (the submodels) of a generic cancer model. We present a concept of supermodel integration with real data by
employing a prediction/correction learning scheme. It is focused on fitting several values of coupling
coefficients between sub-models, instead of matching scores of tumor model parameters as it is in the
classical data adaptation techniques. We postulate also that there exist such the generic coarse-grained
computer model of cancer, which can be used as a computational framework for developing high
quality supermodels. The latent fine-grained tumor features, e.g., microscopic processes and other
unpredictable events accompanying its proliferation not included in the model, are hidden in incoming
real data. This concept can be merged with OPAL approach, which rather cannot be considered in the
present form as a viable cancer prognosis method. Apart from high computational complexity, the
OPAL models represent fully continuous approach. Such the models cannot account of the discrete
vessels remodeling process, which is crucial for tumor growth/recurrence evolution (Rieger et al.,
2016). In Fig.6 we compare the snapshots from two simulations of similar tumor growth scenarios
displaying oxygen distribution for continuous/discrete (with discrete vascularization) and purely
continuous (AWESUMM) model. The first figure (Fig.6a) clearly displays some remaining functional
perfusive blood capillaries inside the tumor while for the continuous model in the same one can
observe place a necrotic spot (Fig.6b). This, seemingly small, difference can produce completely
different results of recurrence process after drag treatment. In the nearest future we plan the following
research steps:
1. We will select the candidate set of simplified tumor models by using both the OPAL framework
(Lima et al. 2016) extended by other advanced continuous/discrete cancer multi-scale model, from
which the candidate set will be generated by neglecting or approximating its parts.

2. We will develop a general procedure for creating the supermodel of cancer by coupling several
sub-models represented by either various instances of a single cancer model or different models
from the candidate set.
3. The method of learning the coupling coefficients will be developed in the prediction/correction
process to match the results produced by the supermodel with real data.
4. The generic (the most parsimonious) cancer models will be selected from the candidate set, i.e.,
the model (or models) which produces the best predictions.
5. Simultaneously we will develop the fast numerical solver based on refined Isogeometric Analysis
concept (Łoś et al., 2016) to speed up the process of learning coupling coefficients.
For elaborating a prognosis for the real cancer evolution, the 3D spatio-temporal concentrations of
tumor cells (oxygen, nutrients, TAF etc.) and the structure of vascular networks should be available as
the input data. Till now this type of diagnostics remains a dream of the future. Therefore, as a proofof-concept, we plan to use the advanced (multi-scale) model of tumor, as a source of artificial data.
The model will mimic the “ground truth”, i.e., the real tumor dynamics. We also expect to couple our
model with real data coming from in vitro images of tumor tomography. The “ground truth” data will
be supplied continually every given time interval. In our opinion, the coupling of the formal submodels with data-based models will be, in the future, the key modeling components in predicting
behavior of biological systems. The formal mathematical models could play the role of an additional
knowledge, which defines more precisely the feature space topology for machine learning tools.
