Abstract. The electric line numerical study is usually made through a harmonic
approach with the impedance concept based on the Finite Difference
discretization in both the time and space domains. These methods present
severe drawbacks when used in impulse working and space dependent
parameters. We present here an efficient numerical tool for electric line
simulation. The mathematical model is based on the telegrapher’s equations. In
the present paper, we propose a new approach based on the Finite Element
Method associated with an efficient algorithm for the numerical resolution of
the telegrapher’s equations. In practice the electric line is connected to the
entrance and the exit with linear or non linear circuits. The objective of this
paper is to provide an efficient numerical tool for electric line simulation in
complex configurations.
Keywords: Transmission line, finite element method, differential system,
impulse voltage, stiff time problem.

1 Introduction
The electric line model shall be built in order to analyze propagation phenomena [1].
Usually the transmission lines are connected at both ends to other circuits, the supply
circuit at the entrance and the utilization circuit at the exit (Fig.1). As a matter of fact,
the analysis of the recorded output signal leads to the characterization of the line.
Hence, the identification of line properties can be done by coupling this model with
an optimization scheme [2][3].
The propagation equations are Partial Differential Equations (PDE) both in time
and space. In order to solve the wave propagation problem, various approaches have
been developed. Many authors use a harmonic approach sometimes associated with a
numerical method for space discretization [4]. This method is generally uneasy to use
particularly in impulse working with wave fronts and space dependent electric
properties. Moreover it is not available in the case of non linear connected circuits or
non linear electric properties. Also, the numerical approach of the problem in the time
and space domain is essentially based on the FDTD method [5]. For these reasons we
propose a general numerical tool for the simulation of the transmission line for a large
class of configurations, based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) for space
discretization, and a Modified Backward Difference Method (MBDM) [6] for time
discretization. The FEM allows complex boundary conditions to be considered [7],
and the MBDM is well recommended for stiff time problems.

Let us consider a transmission line with entrance and exit circuits ( Fig. 1).

We can propose a technique capable of approaching complex boundary conditions:
- At the entrance of the line we can apply a time dependent voltage, and the
propagation phenomenon takes place in an open transmission line.
- We can include the electric characteristics of the voltage source with its
connection at the entrance and a known impedance at the exit. This circuit
possibly contains resistances, capacitances and self-inductions.

3 Finite Element Formulation
We have tested a new approach by the FEM for space discretization. Here the
advantage of the FEM concerns the boundary conditions and the space-dependent
electric properties. In fact we have natural boundary conditions and essential
boundary conditions [8][9]. In accordance with these boundary conditions different
Finite Element formulations are possible. So the corresponding boundary conditions
can be expressed through Dirichlet’s conditions or mixed conditions.
3.1

Weak Formulations

The Galerkin weighting applied to the system (1) gives rise to a weak formulation.
In accordance with the boundary conditions of the problem under consideration, one
can use one of the following formulations (2) (3) obtained via different integrationby-parts schemes ; we present examples :

These formulations are mathematically equivalent. We can choose the one that best
fits the form of the model of boundary conditions.
3.2 Matricial Formulations

For the implementation of the different formulations (2) (3) for users, we must be
aware of the details of matricial formulation. For this reason we have to provide the
significant example below. Line length is discretized into ne elements (Ωe) with
 ∪ e ( Ω e ) = ( Ω) . We have used Lagrange’s linear polynomial base <n(z)> [7]. We
have choosen the first formulation (2) to illustrate the matricial form. The geometrical
and analytical discretizations can be written as follows :
⎛
⎜
⎡{n}.µ r . n

4 Numerical Method
4.1 The Modified Backward Difference Method Technique (MBDM)

For all weak formulations, the general formulation of the differential system is [8] :
d
{U } = {Φ(U, t )} where {Φ(U , t )} = [M]-1 . ({F} - [K ]. {U})
(7)
dt
For the numerical time-resolution, the MBDM is used. With the proposed
formulation one can choose the time order of discretization and the upward scheme
[6][10]. In this context, it is possible to apply a matrix-free technique. As a matter of
fact the mass matrix and the stiffness matrix are never built during the calculation. As
a consequence, we obtain a high performance level in terms of CPU time and storage
cost. This technique can be summarized in the following algorithm :

5 Numerical Results
5.1 The Benchmark

Let us consider a transmission line with an open circuit at the exit. So we have
Dirichlet conditions at both ends of the line. In this case, weak formulation (2) before
the discretization of the mathematical model is the most convenient one.
In order to test the proposed method, a very unfavorable case is considered : line
without loss, small space-discretization (1000 elements), first order timediscretization and time discontinuity as initial condition (step of voltage).
The main difficulty of the numerical computation of the wave front propagation is
that numerical instabilities may occur. The MBDM technique provides an upward
time-parameter α. The numerical instability control has been calculated for different
values of parameter α : thus we can determine an optimal value for α.
Fig. 3 shows the time dependent intensity signal at the entrance of the line and Fig.
4, the space dependent intensity signal at t = 0.5.

Fig. 3. Time dependent intensity at the entrance of the line for two values of α

One can notice from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, that if the α-value is lower than 0.5, no
stable numerical solution can be obtained with a realistic time step. By using an
optimal value of α, we obtain the well-known signal with a rectangular form (Fig.5).

5.2 Example of a Non Linear Circuit

Let us examine the case of a non linear circuit (a transistor, for example) connected at
the end of the line. Fig. 6 presents a bipolar transistor.

Fig. 6. An example of non linear circuit

We will not give all working details about this classical electronic component. In
our context the peculiarity of the problem is the non-linearity of the static currentvoltage characteristic of the collector-emitter.
For a given base-emitter voltage, the bipolar transistor can be equivalent to the
circuit presented in Fig. 6. At a high frequency the collector-emitter capacitance Cce is
not negligible and the static part of the transistor’s characteristic is represented by a
variable resistance. The dimensionless form of the intensity can be written:
∂v
i = A. + ϕ (v)
(9)
∂t
The extraction of ϕ(v) in equation (9) is performed by an elementary numerical
method. In impulse working this circuit is modelized by a differential equation (9). In
that case we also choose formulation (3) because it is possible to introduce the
intensity in the integration-by-parts directly. The voltage at the entrance is similar to
the example above. At the exit of the line the term of integration-by-parts of formula
(3) can be written :
⎛
⎞
⎧ ∂v ⎫
[δv. i ]10 = δv n .{n( z )}.⎜⎜ A. n( z ) .⎨ n ⎬ + ϕ (v n ) ⎟⎟
(10)
⎩ ∂t ⎭
⎝
⎠ z =1

This matricial formulation is modified because we do not have here a modification
of the elementary matrix [ke] but a modification of elementary electric loading {fe}.
Function ϕ(v) must be built at each iteration of algorithm (8). Under these conditions
and for the last element (z =1) the elementary matrices concerned are modified as
follows :
0

⎧
⎧f ⎫
⎧ fi ⎫

Algorithm (8) is performed with the same numerical characteristics.
In Fig. 7, we notice a transient complex intensity signal at the entrance of the line.
If the dimensionless time is lower than 2 a step of intensity propagates along the line,
reflects at the end and comes back. After this we can see the influence of the exit
circuit.

6 Conclusion
For the simulation of the transmission lines, we wish to place at the disposal of
electronics specialists, a numerical tool which is effective as much by its simplicity as
by its performances. The main applicability of this technique concerns complex cases
of line models, these potentialities being associated to a simple data-processing tool
that can be used by non specialists. By its various formulations, the method makes it
possible to approach the whole of the problems quoted above. Moreover, in this
context, we have developed a method of numerical resolution specific to the problems
of transmission lines. We have sought significant examples which illustrate the
principle of the method as well as concrete application cases.
