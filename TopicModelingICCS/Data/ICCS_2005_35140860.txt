Abstract. The time dependence of the anisotropy of ﬂuorescence after
an impulsive excitation in the molecular ring (resembling the B850 ring of
the purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas acidophila) is calculated. Fast
ﬂuctuations of the environment are simulated by dynamic disorder and
slow ﬂuctuations by static disorder. Without dynamic disorder modest
degrees of static disorder are suﬃcient to cause the experimentally found
initial drop of the anisotropy on a sub-100 fs time scale. In the present
investigation we are comparing results for the time-dependent optical
anisotropy of the molecular ring for four models of the static disorder:
Gaussian disorder in the local energies (Model A), Gaussian disorder in
the transfer integrals (Model B), Gaussian disorder in radial positions
of molecules (Model C) and Gaussian disorder in angular positions of
molecules (Model D). Both types of disorder - static and dynamic - are
taken into account simultaneously.

Introduction

We are dealing with the ring-shaped units resembling those from antenna complex LH2 of the purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas acidophila in which a
highly eﬃcient light collection and excitation transfer towards the reaction center takes place. Due to a strong coupling limit (large interaction J between
bacteriochlorophylls) our theoretical approach considers an extended Frenkel
exciton states model.
Despite intensive study, the precise role of the protein moiety in governing the
dynamics of the excited states is still under debate [1]. At room temperature the
solvent and protein environment ﬂuctuate with characteristic time scales ranging from femtoseconds to nanoseconds. The dynamical aspects of the system are
reﬂected in the line shapes of electronic transitions. To fully characterize the line
shape of a transition and thereby the dynamics of the system, one needs to know
not only the ﬂuctuation amplitude (coupling strength) but also the time scale
of each process involved. The observed linewidth reﬂect the combined inﬂuence
of static disorder and exciton coupling to intermolecular, intramolecular, and

solvent nuclear motions. The simplest approach is to decompose the line proﬁle
into homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions of the dynamic and static
disorder. Yet, a satisfactory understanding of the nature of the static disorder
in light-harvesting systems has not been reached [1]. In the site excitation basis,
there can be present static disorder in both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal elements.
Silbey pointed out several questions: It is not clear whether only the consideration of the former is enough or the latter should be included as well. If both are
considered, then there remains a question about whether they are independent
or correlated.
Time-dependent experiments of the femtosecond dynamics of the energy
transfer and relaxation [2, 3] led for the B850 ring in LH2 complexes to conclusion that the elementary dynamics occurs on a time scale of about 100 fs
[4, 5, 6]. For example, depolarization of ﬂuorescence was studied already quite
some time ago for a model of electronically coupled molecules [7, 8]. Rahman
et al. [7] were the ﬁrst who recognize the importance of the oﬀ-diagonal density matrix elements (coherences) [9] which can lead to an initial anisotropy
larger than the incoherent theoretical limit of 0.4. Already some time ago substantial relaxation on the time scale of 10-100 fs and an anomalously large
initial anisotropy of 0.7 was observed by Nagarjan et al. [4]. The high initial
anisotropy was ascribed to a coherent excitation of a degenerate pair of states
with allowed optical transitions and then relaxation to states at lower energies which have forbidden transitions. Nagarjan et al. [5] concluded, that the
main features of the spectral relaxation and the decay of anisotropy are reproduced well by a model considering decay processes of electronic coherences
within the manifold of the excitonic states and thermal equilibration among the
excitonic states. In that contribution the exciton dynamics was not calculated
explicitly.
In several steps [10, 11, 12, 13] we have recently extended the former investigations by Kumble and Hochstrasser [14] and Nagarjan et al. [5]. For a Gaussian
distribution of local energies in the ring units we added the eﬀect of dynamical disorder by using a quantum master equation in the Markovian and nonMarkovian limits. We also investigated inﬂuence of static disorder in transfer
integrals [15, 16].
In our present investigation we are comparing results for the time-dependent
optical anisotropy of the molecular ring for four models of the static disorder:
Gaussian disorder in the local energies, Gaussian disorder in the transfer integrals, Gaussian disorder in radial positions of molecules and Gaussian disorder
in angular positions of molecules.

Model

In the following we assume that only one excitation is present on the ring after
an impulsive excitation [14]. The Hamiltonian of an exciton in the ideal ring
coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators reads

All of the Qy transition dipole moments of the chromophores (bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) B850) in a ring without static and dynamic disorder lie approximately in the plane of the ring and the entire dipole strength of the B850 band
comes from a degenerate pair of orthogonally polarized transitions at an energy
slightly higher than the transition energy of the lowest exciton state.

of suﬃciently wide spectral bandwidth will always prepare the same initial state,
irrespective of the actual eigenstates of the real ring. After impulsive excitation

Obtaining of the full time dependence of δΩ(t) is not a simple task. We have
succeeded to calculate microscopically full time dependence of δΩ(t) only for the
simplest molecular model namely dimer [18]. In case of molecular ring we should
resort to some simpliﬁcation [13].
In what follows we use Markovian version of Eq. (10) with a simple model
for correlation functions Cmn of the bath assuming that each site (i.e. each
chromophore) has its own bath completely uncoupled from the baths of the
other sites. Furthermore it is assumed that these baths have identical properties
[2, 19]. Then only one correlation function C(ω) of the bath is needed
Cmn (ω) = δmn C(ω) = δmn 2π[1 + nB (ω)][J(ω) − J(−ω)].

(11)

Here J(ω) is the spectral density of the bath [19] and nB (ω) the Bose-Einstein
distribution of phonons. The model of the spectral density J(ω) often used in
literature is
ω2
(12)
J(ω) = Θ(ω)j0 3 e−ω/ωc .
2ωc
Spectral density has its maximum at 2ωc . We shall use (in agreement with [2])
j0 = 0.4 and ωc = 0.2.

Results and Conclusions

The anisotropy of ﬂuorescence (Eq. (7)) has been calculated using dynamical
equations for the exciton density matrix ρ to express the time dependence of the
optical properties of the ring units in the femtosecond time range. Details are
the same as in Ref. [13, 15, 16].
For the numerical time propagation of the density matrix ρ (Eq. 9) the short
iterative Arnoldi method [20] as well as the standard Runge-Kutta scheme have

been used. An advantage of the short iterative Arnoldi method with respect to
the standard Runge-Kutta scheme is the low computational eﬀort for moderate
accuracy [21]. Furthermore, the expansion coeﬃcients are adapted at each time
to a ﬁxed time step with a prespeciﬁed tolerance in contrast to the Runge-Kutta
scheme in which the time step is adapted. An uniform time grid is important
for averaging of various realizations at the same time points without interpolation. The realization averaging and the orientational averaging can easily be
parallelized by means of Message passing interface (MPI). Some computations
were performed on a PC cluster. So instead of running about 10 000 realizations
on one node, 312 realizations can be calculated on each of the 32 nodes (or 52
realizations on each of 192 nodes).
In Ref. [14], which does not take the bath into account, the anisotropy of
ﬂuorescence of the LH2 ring decreases from 0.7 to 0.3 − 0.35 and subsequently
reaches a ﬁnal value of 0.4. One needs a strength of static disorder of ∆ ≈ 0.4−0.8
to reach a decay time below 100 fs.
Results of our simulations are presented graphically in Fig. 1. and Fig. 2.
We use dimensionless energies normalized to the transfer integral J12 and the
renormalized time τ . To convert τ into seconds one has to divide τ by 2πcJ12
with c being the speed of light in cm s−1 and J12 in cm−1 . Estimation of the
transfer integral J12 varies between 250 cm−1 and 400 cm−1 . For these extreme values of J12 our time unit (τ = 1) corresponds to 21.2 fs or 13.3 fs.

In Fig. 1 and 2 the time and static disorder ∆ dependence of the anisotropy
depolarization for four models of the static disorder is given. In model B) ∆ =
∆J , in model C) ∆ = ∆r and in model D) ∆ = ∆ϕ . In the left column the
results without the exciton-bath interaction are shown, in the right column the
interaction with the bath is taken into account in the Markovian treatment of
the dynamic disorder with the j0 = 0.4 and for the temperature T = 0.5 (in
dimensionless units). To convert T into kelvins one has to divide T by k/J12
with k beeing the Boltzmann constant in cm−1 K−1 and J12 in cm−1 .
Rahman et al. [7] were the ﬁrst who recognized the importance of the oﬀdiagonal density matrix elements (coherences) [9] which can lead to an initial
anisotropy r(0) larger than the incoherent theoretical limit of 0.4.

Without dynamic disorder modest degrees of static disorder are suﬃcient to
cause the experimentally found initial drop of the anisotropy on a sub-100 fs
time scale. Diﬀerence between the Gaussian static disorder in the local energies
(Model A) and the Gaussian static disorder in the transfer integrals (Model B)
calculations expressed by the time interval in which the anisotropy depolarization
reaches r = 0.4 (the incoherent theoretical limit) is almost as much as 100 %
for the same value of the static disorder ∆ = ∆J . It means that the same drop
of the anisotropy may be caused even by the diagonal static disorder (model A)
with ∆ or by the static disorder in the transfer integrals with ∆J = 0.5∆. This
diﬀerence between the Model A and the Model B calculations is still present also
in the case, when the exciton interaction with the bath is taken into account.
In model C) the strength of the static disorder ∆r = 0.12 and in model D) the
strength of the static disorder ∆ϕ = 0.04 have practically the same eﬀect as
∆ = 0.6 in model A).
