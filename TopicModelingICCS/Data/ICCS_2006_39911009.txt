Abstract. This paper describes simulated annealing technique,which is
a Monte Carlo method, to analyze and improve the eﬃciency of the design of Global Positioning System (GPS) surveying networks. The paper
proposes various local search procedures which can be coupled with the
simulated annealing technique.

Introduction

The GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that permit users to determine
their three-dimensional position. Sequencing play a crucial role in GPS management. In the last decades simulated annealing is considered as a heuristic
method that uses a Monte Carlo global minimization technique for minimizing
multi-variance functions [2]. The concept is based on the manner in which liquids
freeze or metal recrystallize in the process of annealing. When related to the positioning the process of designing a GPS surveying network can be described as
follows. A number of receivers r are placed at stations n and take simultaneous
measurements from satellites. The receivers are then moved to other stations
for further measurements. The problem is to search for a best order in which to
consecutively observe these sessions to have the best schedule at minimum cost
(time) i.e.: M inimize : C(V ) = p∈R C(Sp ), where: C(V ) is the total cost of
a feasible schedule V ; Sp is the rout of the receiver p in a schedule; R is the set
of receivers.
To maximize the beneﬁt to use simulated annealing, diﬀerent Local Search
(LS) procedures have been coupled with this technique to improve the performance and explore the search space more eﬀectively. The rest of this paper is
organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the simulated annealing method applied
to GPS surveying networks. The search strategy of the local search is explained
in Section 3 and followed by diﬀerent local search procedures. Several case studies
and the obtained numerical results are reported in Section 4.

successfully applied to the majority of real-life problems [1, 2, 3]. The algorithm
starts by generating an initial solution and by initializing the so-called temperature parameter T . The temperature is decreased during the search process, thus
at the beginning of the search the probability of accepting uphill moves is high
and it gradually decreases. Initial solution is a random solution. The structure

Local Search Strategies

LS procedure perturb given solution to generate diﬀerent neighborhoods using
a move generation mechanism [6]. A move generation is a transition from a
schedule V to another one V ∈ I(V ) in one step (iteration). In Saleh [4], a
local search procedure that satisﬁes the GPS requirements has been developed.
This procedure is based on the sequential session-interchange. The potential pairswaps are examined in the order (1, 2),(1, 3), . . ., (1, n),(2, 3), (2, 4), . . ., (n−1, n),
n is the number of sessions. The solution is represented by graph. The nodes
correspond to the sessions and the edges correspond to the observation order.
For comparison reason this sequential local search procedure is called procedure
(a). In this paper two new local search procedures have been developed. In the
ﬁrst, see Figure 1, A and B are chains of nodes (part of the solution) while {0, i}
and {i + 1, n} are, the ﬁrst and the last nodes of the chains A and B respectively.
In this procedure only one exchange of new edge [n − 1, 0] has been performed
each iteration and this can be done by selecting one edge [i, i + 1] to be removed.
For comparison reason this local search procedure is called (b1).

In the second procedure, as shown in Figure 2, A, B and C are chains of nodes
(part of the solution), where {0, i}, {i + 1, j} and {j + 1, n − 1} are the ﬁrst and
the last nodes of the chains A, B and C respectively. In the case of two edge
exchange, there are several possibilities to build a new solution where the edges
[i, i + 1] and [j, j + 1] are selected to be removed in one iteration. For comparison
reason this local search procedure is called (b2).

Experimental Results

This section reports on the computational experience of the simulated annealing
coupled with local search procedures using real GPS networks. The ﬁrst network
is a GPS network of Malta. The initial schedule with a cost of 1405 minutes was
composed of 38 sessions observed. The second network is a GPS network of
Seychelles. The initial schedule with cost of 994 minutes was composed of 71
sessions observed.
Where: CIN T - The cost of the initial solution; Ca - Schedule using local search
procedure (a); Cb1 - Schedule using local search procedure (b1); Cb2 Schedule
using local search procedure (b2).
We compare simulated annealing algorithm coupled with Saleh and Dare [4, 5]
LS procedure, with developed in this paper LS procedures (b1) and (b2). The
analysis of the results in Table 1 shows the advantage of the local search procedure (b2). We use the following parameters: initial temperature 8, ﬁnal temperature 3, cooling parameter 0.9 for all tests. In the simulated annealing the

Conclusion

In this paper two local search procedures have been developed and compared
with local search procedure from [4, 5], procedure (a). The comparison of the
performance of the simulated annealing of these procedures applying to diﬀerent
GPS networks is reported. The obtained results are encouraging and the ability of
the developed techniques to generate rapidly high-quality solutions for observing
GPS networks can be seen. The problem is important because it arises in mobile
phone communications too.
