Abstract. Functional equations is a very powerful technique to obtain
consistent models in Economics. Unfortunately, there is only a few computer tools for solving functional equations. In this paper a Mathematica
package, FSolve, is applied to the symbolic analysis of some economical
models for price and advertising policies. The procedure is as follows:
ﬁrstly, we make some assumptions about the functional structure of the
functions describing the models. Such assumptions are given in terms
of functional equations that account for some economical properties.
Then, the package is applied to compute the solutions of these equations
and check for inconsistencies. The interesting cases of the monopoly and
duopoly models are discussed.

Introduction

One of the most appealing applications of the computer algebra systems (CAS) is
the symbolic analysis of economical models [8, 9]. By this we mean to determine
the symbolic solutions of the equations governing those models, which must be
based on reasonable properties. The starting point of this process is to establish
the conditions - which must be meaningful from the viewpoint of economical
sciences - that those functions must satisfy necessarily. Then, the derived equations must be solved. However, it is quite hard in general to determine which
are the conditions characterizing the problem and thus, some assumptions are
usually taken. For instance, the functional structure of the functions describing
the models is sometimes arbitrarily chosen, based either on convenience or on
empirical considerations. Very often, this fact leads to absurd solutions and/or
inconsistencies.
Our experience is that the functional equations is an optimal technique to
overcome these undesirable situations. They provide powerful and consistent
methods to describe the common sense properties of the economical functions
and, simultaneously, the mathematical tools for solving the resulting equations
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The drawback of this picture is that most of this work must be performed by hand, as there is is only a few computer tools for solving functional
equations. One remarkable exception is a Mathematica package, FSolve, developed by one of the authors and described in [6]. In this paper, the package will
be successfully applied to the analysis of some monopoly and duopoly models
for price and advertising policies.

The structure of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we describe brieﬂy
the package FSolve. Then, in Section 3 we analyze some economical models
for price and advertising policies. The procedure is as follows: ﬁrstly, we make
some assumptions about the functional structure of the functions describing the
models. Such assumptions are given in terms of functional equations that account
for some economical properties. Then, the package is applied to compute the
solutions of these equations and check for inconsistencies. The interesting cases
of the monopoly and duopoly models are discussed.

The Package FSolve

In this section the Mathematica package FSolve is brieﬂy described. The package has been implemented a few years ago in Mathematica 3.0 [6] but updated
versions for Mathematica 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 and 5.0 are also available. We start our
discussion by loading the package:
In[1]:=<<FunctionalEquations‘FSolve‘
which includes the command
FSolve[eqn, {f unctions}, {variables}, options]
where eqn denotes the functional equation to be solved, {f unctions} is the list
of unknown functions, {variables} is the list of variables and options allows the
users to consider diﬀerent domains for the variables (see Table 1) and classes of
feasible functions (see Table 2).
For instance, we can calculate the solution of the functional equation f (x +
y) = g(x) + h(y) where x, y ∈ IR and f, g, h are continuous functions as:
In[2]:= FSolve[f[x+y]==g[x]+h[y],{f,g,h},{x,y},Domain->Real,
Class->Continuous]
{f (x) → C(1) x + C(2) + C(3), g(x) → C(1) x + C(2),
Out[2] :=
h(x) → C(1) x + C(3)}
where C(1), C(2) and C(3) are arbitrary constants. Note that the general solution can depend on one or more arbitrary constants and even on arbitrary
functions (see Out(3) and Out(4) for two examples). Note also that a single
equation can determine several unknown functions (such as f, g and h in this
example). The reader is referred to [7] for a general introduction to the theory
of functional equations and their applications.

Price and Advertising Policies

In this section the package FSolve is applied to analyze some economical models
for price and advertising policies. In particular, we focus on the problem of modeling the sales S(p, v) of a single-product ﬁrm such that they depend on the price p of
its product and on the advertising expenditure v. Because of limitations of space,
we will restrict our discussion to the cases of monopoly and duopoly models.

The Monopoly Model

Let us assume a ﬁrm such that the sales S of a single product depend on the
unitary price p and on the advertising expenditure v, that is, S = S(p, v). The
function S cannot be arbitrary, but it must satisfy the following properties:
(M1) The S(p, v) function is continuous in both arguments.
(M2) ∀ v, the S(p, v) function, considered as a function of p only, must be convex from below and decreasing. This implies that, for the same advertising

expenses, any increment in the unit price of the product leads to a reduction in sales, and that its derivative decreases with p.
(M3) ∀ p, the S(p, v) function, considered as a function of v only, must be concave from below and increasing. This implies that, for the same unit price,
an increment in the advertising expenses leads to an increment in sales.
(M4) A multiplicative change in the advertising expenditure leads to an additive
change in sales, that is,
S(p, v w) = S(p, v) + T (p, w),

(1)

where p ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, w ≥ 0, T (p, 1) = 0 and T (p, w) is increasing with w.
(M5) The sales due to an increment q in price are equal to the previous sales
times a real number, which depends on q and v, that is,
S(p + q, v) = S(p, v) R(q, v)

(2)

where p ≥ 0, p + q ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, R(0, v) = 1 and R(q, v) is decreasing in q.
Eq. (1) can be solved by using the package FSolve as follows:
In[3]:= em1=FSolve[S[p,v*w]==S[p,v]+T[p,w],{S,T},{p,v,w},
Domain->RealPositiveZero,Class->Continuous]
Out[3] := {S(p, v) → Arb1(p) Log(v) + Arb2(p), T (p, w) → Arb1(p) Log(w)}
where Arb1(p) and Arb2(p) denote two arbitrary functions depending on the
variable p. Similarly, we can solve eq. (2) as:
In[4]:= em2=FSolve[S[p+q,v]==S[p,v]*R[q,v],{S,R},{p,q,v},
Domain->RealPositiveZero,Class->Continuous]
Out[4] := S(p, v) → Arb3(v) ep Arb4(v) , R(q, v) → eq Arb4(v)
where Arb3(v) and Arb4(v) denote two arbitrary functions depending on the
variable v. Once we have solved functional equations (1) and (2) separately, the
general solution of the system (1)-(2) is given by:
In[5]:= FSolve[Equal @@ (S[p,v] /. First[#]& /@ {em1,em2}),
{Arb1,Arb2,Arb3,Arb4},{p,v}];
In[6]:= S[p,v] /. %
Out[6] := (C(1) + C(2) Log[v]) Exp[−C(3) p]
where C(1), C(2) and C(3) are arbitrary constants. Note that in Out[6] we
have no longer arbitrary functions, but arbitrary constants. This means that the
parametric model is completely speciﬁed and that we can estimate its parameters
C(1), C(2) and C(3) using empirical data.
The obtained solution shows a logarithmic increment of sales with advertising
expenditures and an exponential decrease with price, in agreement with assumptions (M4) and (M5). One justiﬁcation of this model of sales is the so-called
Weber-Fechner law, that states that the stimuli of the intensity of perception is
a linear function of the logarithm of the intensity of the stimulus.

The previous model was proposed by Eichhorn in 1978 [5]. It can be argued,
however, that the function R should depend on the price p, instead of v. Thus,
we can replace (M5) by:
(M6) The sales due to an increment q in price are equal to the previous sales
times a real number, which depends on q and p, that is,
S(p + q, v) = S(p, v) R(q, p)

(3)

where p ≥ 0, p + q ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, R(0, p) = 1 and R(q, p) is decreasing in q.
The general solution of (3) can be obtained by using the package FSolve as:
In[7]:= em3=FSolve[S[p+q,v]==S[p,v]*R[q,p],{S,R},{p,q,v},
Domain->RealPositiveZero,Class->Continuous]
Arb5(p + q)
Out[7] := S(p, v) → Arb5(p) Arb6(v), R(q, p) →
Arb5(p)
Alternatively, we can assume a multiplicative, instead of an additive, change
in the price p and we can question whether or not choosing between one of these
assumptions inﬂuences the resulting model. In other words, we can assume:
(M7) The sales due to a multiplicative change (w times) in the price are equal
to the previous sales times a real number, which depends on w and p, that
is,
S(p w, v) = S(p, v) R(w, p)
(4)
where p ≥ 0, w ≥ 0, v ≥ 0, R(1, p) = 1 and R(w, p) is decreasing in w.
In[8]:= FSolve[S[p*w,v]==S[p,v]*R[w,p],{S,R},{p,v,w},
Domain->RealPositiveZero,Class->Continuous]
Arb5(p w)
Out[8] := S(p, v) → Arb5(p) Arb6(v), R(w, p) →
Arb5(p)
Note that the S functions in Out[7] and Out[8] are identical. Thus, equations
(3) and (4) are equivalent. Consequently, the above mentioned two assumptions
(M6) and (M7) lead to the same model.
Now, the solution of the system (1)-(3) can be obtained as:
In[9]:= FSolve[Equal @@ (S[p,v] /. First[#]& /@ {em1,em3}),
{Arb1,Arb2,Arb5,Arb6},{p,v}]

The Duopoly Model

Assume now that we have two diﬀerent ﬁrms that compete in the market. Assume
also that the sales S of the product by ﬁrm 1 depend on the unit prices p
and q and on the advertising expenditures u and v, of the two ﬁrms, that is,
S = S(p, q, u, v). The function S(p, q, u, v) must satisfy the following properties:
(D1)
(D2)
(D3)
(D4)

The S(p, q, u, v) function is continuous in all arguments.
S(p, q, u, v) is increasing in q and u.
S(p, q, u, v) is decreasing in p and v.
A multiplicative change in the advertising expenditure of ﬁrm 1 leads to
an additive change in sales, that is,
S(p, q, u w, v) = S(p, q, u, v) + T (p, q, w, v)

(5)

(D5) The sales due to an increment r in price of ﬁrm 1 are equal to the previous
sales times a real number, which depends on r and p, that is,
S(p + r, q, u, v) = S(p, q, u, v) R(r, p, q, v)

(6)

where p ≥ 0, p + r ≥ 0, v ≥ 0 and R(0, p, q, v) = 1.
The general solution of the system (5)-(6) is given by the following sequence
of calculations: ﬁrstly, we compute the functions S, T and R of the previous
equations, and then we apply the outputs to calculate the functional structure
of function S.
In[11]:= ed1=FSolve[S[p,q,u*w,v]==S[p,q,u,v]+T[p,q,w,v],{S,T},
{p,q,u,v,w},Domain->RealPositiveZero,
Class->Continuous];
In[12]:= ed2=FSolve[S[p+r,q,u,v]==S[p,q,u,v]+R[r,p,q,v],{S,R},
{p,q,r,u,v},Domain->RealPositiveZero,
Class->Continuous];
In[13]:= FSolve[Equal @@ (S[p,q,u,v] /. First[#]& /@ {ed1,ed2}),
{Arb1,Arb2,Arb3,Arb4},{p,q,u,v}];
In[14]:= S[p,q,u,v] /. %
Out[14] := Arb1(p, q, v) [Log(u) + Arb2(q, v)]
where Arb1(p, q, v) and Arb2(q, v) are arbitrary functions. In addition we can
consider the following assumption:
(D6) The total sales of both ﬁrms is a constant K, that is,
S(p, q, u, v) + S(q, p, v, u) = K

(7)

which, using the previous output, leads to
In[15]:= FSolve[((S[p,q,u,v]+S[q,p,v,u]) /. %)==K,{Arb1,Arb2},
{p,q,u,v},Domain->RealPositiveZero,Class->Continuous]

where Arb7(p) is an arbitrary but increasing function of p. The physical interpretation of this model is as follows: if the advertisement expenditures of both

ﬁrms are coincident, the sales are proportional to the ratios
Arb7(p) + Arb7(q)
Arb7(p)
for ﬁrms 1 and 2, respectively. On the other hand, the
and
Arb7(p) + Arb7(q)
advertisement expenditures inﬂuence sales directly proportional to the logarithm
u
of the ratio and inversely proportional to Arb7(p) + Arb7(q).
v
We can now consider two additional assumptions:
(D7) The sales S(p + r, q + s, u, v) of ﬁrm 1 due to increments r and s in the
prices of ﬁrms 1 and 2, respectively, are the initial sales S(p, q, u, v) of ﬁrm
1 times two factors which consider the associated reduction and increments
due to these two changes, that is,
S(p + r, q + s, u, v) = S(p, q, u, v) U (r, p, q) V (s, p, q)

(8)

(D8) The sales S(p, q, u + r, v + s) of ﬁrm 1 due to increments r and s in the
advertisement expenditures of ﬁrms 1 and 2, respectively, are the initial
sales S(p, q, u, v) of ﬁrm 1 times two factors which consider the associated
increments and decrements due to these two changes, that is,
S(p, q, u + r, v + s) = S(p, q, u, v) U (r, u, v) V (s, u, v)

(9)

Combining now (D7) and (D8) and solving the system of equations (8)-(9),
we get:
In[17]:= FSolve[S[p+r,q+s,u,v]==S[p,q,u,v]*U[r,p,q]*V[s,p,q],
{S,U,V},{p,q,r,s,u,v},Domain->RealPositiveZero,
Class->Continuous];
In[18]:= FSolve[S[p,q,u+r,v+s]==S[p,q,u,v]*U[r,u,v]*V[s,u,v],
{S,U,V},{p,q,r,s,u,v},Domain->RealPositiveZero,
Class->Continuous];
In[19]:= FSolve[Equal @@ (S[p,q,u,v] /. First[#]& /@ {%%,%}),
{Arb1,Arb2,Arb3,Arb6,Arb7,Arb8},{p,q,u,v}];
In[20]:= S[p,q,u,v] /. %
Out[20] := Arb1(p) Arb2(q) Arb6(u) Arb7(v)

Symbolic Analysis of Economical Models with Mathematica

421

where the functions Arb1(p) and Arb7(v) are decreasing and the functions
Arb2(q) and Arb6(u) are increasing, but otherwise arbitrary. The physical interpretation of this model is that all the factors (prices and advertisement expenditures) act independently and contribute to the total sales of ﬁrm 1 as a factor
which is less than 1 and decreasing for p and v and greater than 1 and increasing
for q and u.
