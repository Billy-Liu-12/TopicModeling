Abstract. Recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that wireless
links in low-power sensor networks are unreliable. Obviously, it is not a good
choice for sensor networks that transmitting data unreliably, which will bring
many problems to the networks, such as uncertainty, performance-decline, and so
on. In this paper, a novel transmission strategy for reliable transmitting over
unreliable links is proposed. Based on the observation that the broadcast nature
of the wireless communications has the potential that allows all neighbors receive and process the packets simultaneously, we suggest that using a nodes-set,
instead of one node, to receive and relay packets. The key idea is that receiving
packets simultaneously and relaying packets competitively. Theoretical and
experimental analysis demonstrates that the new strategy can provide reliable
transmitting over unreliable links meanwhile improves the performance of networks significantly.
Keywords: Sensor Networks, Reliable Transmission, Nodes cooperation.

1 Introduction
Recent empirical and theoretical studies [1] ~ [4] have shown that wireless links in real
sensor networks are unreliable. Particularly, in dense deployments, a large number of
links in the sensor network (even higher than 50%) can be unreliable. The unreliability
is derived from many factors such as multipath fading, unreliable sensor nodes and
stochastic interference. It seems that the unreliability is one of the inherent properties of
low-power wireless links.
Obviously, reliable transmission is hoped for communications of networks. In order
to overcome the unreliable links in network layer, some efforts ([5] [6] [7]) have been
put in defining metrics to characterize the energy efficiency of communication. Based
on these metrics, the communication over unreliable links could be optimized. These
methods all focus on the single link. However, the performance improvement through
the optimization of single link is limited. For example, there are two links (link1 and
link2) from node A to node B. In time1, link1 is better than link2. It means link1 has
higher PRR (packet reception rate) than link2. But, in time2, link2 is better than link1.
It can’t be predicted which link would be better in one time. So when you want to send
packet from node A to node B, you can’t exactly choose the optimal link to send. It can

be said that it is difficult to get satisfactory transmission performance over unreliable
links just only using single link optimization.
In this paper, a reliable transmitting strategy, called Set Transfer, is proposed. It can
realize reliable transmission over unreliable links meanwhile improves the energy
efficiency of networks significantly. The key idea is that using multi nodes receive
packets simultaneously and relay packets competitively. The energy efficiency of Set
Transfer is analyzed theoretically and experimentally.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is related works. Section 3
proposes the reliable transmitting strategy Set Transfer. In Section 4, the energy efficiency of Set Transfer is analyzed. Simulation and conclusion are in Section 5, 6.

2 Related Works
Although the ability of single node is limited, the ability of multi-nodes cooperation
may be huge. There have been some researches on sensor nodes cooperation in physical
layer [8] ~ [11]. Multipath fading is a fundamental phenomenon which makes reliable
wireless transmission difficult in wireless communication. In order to reducing the
effective error rate in a multipath fading channel, some diversity techniques such as
multiple-antenna [8], relay channel model [11], are proposed. The main idea of diversity techniques is that sending one signal through different channels and combining
signals from different channels at the terminal. Diversity can achieve signal gains. A.
Sendonaris at el. [9] [10] proposed a new form of spatial diversity technique which
achieve diversity gains through the cooperation of in-cell users (mobile - base station
communication). Unfortunately, this approach sends many duplicate packets, decreasing the energy efficiency of networks. Diversity-techniques studies are now
concentrated on physical layer.
Some unreliable-link models [2] [3] [4] have been proposed. It can help us further
understand the realistic link layer of sensor networks. According to these models, there
are three distinct reception regions in wireless sensor links: connected, transitional, and
disconnected. The transitional region is often large in size, and generally has
high-various reception rates. M. Zuniga at el. [4] derived expressions for reception rate
as a function of distance for different settings.
Inspired by these researches, we study unreliable-links cooperation in network layer.
Based on the unreliable-link models [2] [3] [4], a novel cooperation approach is proposed which can be said a new form of diversity technique.

3 The Reliable Transmitting Strategy: Set Transfer
3.1 The Preliminaries
In this part, two assumptions and a profile about Set Transfer are presented.
A. Assumptions
1.
2.

The low-power wireless sensor links are unreliable.
The broadcast mechanism such as CSMA-CA is used in link layer protocols.

378

Z. Wu and S. Li

CSMA-CA mechanism has been widely used in wireless communications, for example, IEEE standard 802.15.4 [12] and IEEE standard 802.11 [13]. It also works well
in ad hoc and sensor networks because of its simple and efficiency.
B. The Profile of Set Transfer
The Set Transfer uses a node-set, instead of one node, to receive and relay packets. A
node-set receives the packets simultaneously (called Set Receiving) and relays it
competitively (called Set Relaying). As Fig.1 shows, the source node sends the packets
to set A1, and set A1 uses Set Receiving to receive packets and uses Set Relaying to
relay packets to set A2, and A2 receives and relays the packets to A3, and so on. Finally, through n hops, packets arrived at the set An, which includes the destination
node. Then any node in the set An transmits the packets to the destination node through
broadcasting.

Fig. 1. Set Transfer

3.2 Set Receiving
According to the broadcast assumption, the wireless sensor networks have the potential
that allows for multi-nodes receive and process packets simultaneously. Thus, instead
of using one node to receive packets, we suggest using a nodes-set to receive packets. It
is called Set Receiving. For example, in Fig.1, the packets sent from source node can be
received by node A1’ or by nodes-set A1. If nodes-set A1 is used, it means that each
node in the set A1 receives packets independently, and if any node receives packets
correctly, the receiving-process of set A1 is completed correctly. Here set A1 could be
seen an integrity which receives and relays packets as one node. In part 2.3, the integrity of nodes-set will be demonstrated.
According to unreliable links assumption, the wireless sensor links are unreliable.
The Pr is used (packet reception rate, 0 < Pr < 1) to denote the reliability of links. The
higher the Pr is, the more reliable the link is. It can be assumed that each link in a

A Reliable Transmission Strategy in Unreliable Wireless Sensor Networks

379

nodes-set is independent with its own Pri (1 < i < n). Then, the packet reception rate
Pset of Set Receiving is:
Pset = 1

－ ( 1 － Pr1 )×( 1 － Pr2 )×…×(1 － Prn )
≥ 1 － ( 1 － Prmin )
n

(1)
(2)

Where Prmin = minPri, 1 < i < n. The n is the power of the nodes-set. From expression
(1), the reliability of Set Receiving is characterized by a non-decreasing, strictly concave function. If Prmin is 0.7 and n = 6, then the packet error rate can be reduced from
10－1 to 10－4. It can be said that the Set Receiving is reliable.
3.3 Set Relaying
In part 3.2, Set Receiving uses a nodes-set to receive packets, and some nodes in the set
will correctly receive the same packets in the same time. However, in multi-hop
transmission, a nodes-set how to relaying packets is still a question. If all nodes in
nodes-set all relay packets to the next hop, the blast of packets replication will occur,
just like flooding mechanism, which wastes too many energy and bandwidth of networks. In this part, Set Relaying scheme is introduced which guarantees that, in one
nodes-set, only one node relays the packets.
Some works on wireless sensor networks [2] [3] [4] proposed some link models
based on recent empirical studies [1] [2]. These models revealed that wireless sensor
links have three distinct reception regions with different distance between two nodes:
connected (normally 0m ~ 11m), transitional (normally 11m ~ 32m), and disconnected
(> 32m). The transitional region is often large in size, and generally has high-various
PRR (packet receive rate) which distributed in 10%~90%; the connected region is often
small in size, and generally has high PRR. Fig.2 shows the analytical link loss model
cited from M. Zuniga et al [4]. If consider the unreliable sensor devices and stochastic
interference factors, the size of the transitional region will further increase.

Z. Wu and S. Li

For the efficiency of transmission, data transmitting usually occurs in transitional
region. According to broadcast assumption and above analyze, we get two observations
as follows.
1. The broadcast nature of the wireless medium allows sensor nodes detecting their
neighbor’s transmission.
2. There are three distinct reception regions in wireless sensor links: connected,
transitional, and disconnected.
Based on the two observations, the Set Relaying can be described as follows:
1. One nodes-set should be lies in one connected region.
2. When a nodes-set receive packets, it stochastically select one node from the

nodes that receive packets successfully to relay the packets with broadcast
mechanism which informs other nodes the packets’ relaying. (Competitive
scheme)
Rule1 guarantees that the relayed packets can be detected reliably. Rule2 guarantees
that only one node in the set relays the packets to the next-hop nodes-set.
Combining Set Receiving and Set Relaying, we get an end-to-end transmission approach Set Transfer, which can realize reliable transmission over unreliable links.

4 Performance Analysis
Section 3 has demonstrated that Set Transfer can provide reliable transmission over
unreliable links. This section will demonstrate that Set Transfer can improve the energy
efficiency of wireless sensor networks, which is an important design issue.
To evaluate the energy efficiency of different transmission strategies, the metric
Energy Per Packet (EPP) is used, which represents the average energy consumption for
each delivered packet from the source node to the destination node. Without loss of
generality, each packet length could be assumed equivalent. The EPP of a sensor
network is comprised as follows:
EPP = Emaintain (Eelec) +ERF + Eprocess

(3)

• Emaintain (Eelec): the amount of energy required to maintain the sensor nodes
working, namely the energy consumption of circuits.
• ERF: the amount of energy required to transmit packets in wireless environment.
• Eprocess: the amount of energy required to process packets in the sensor nodes.
In the design of modern processors, the power consumption Eprocess can be made
negligible compared to transmit powers [14]. So it can be deduced that
ERF >> Eprocess

(4)

Eelec is the power that supports sensor nodes in working state which can not be ignored
compared to transmit powers. On the other hand, Set Transfer can work with any MAC
layer protocols as long as it accords with the broadcast assumption, such as IEEE
802.11, 802.15.4 and some new medium access control (MAC) protocols designed for
WSN [15] [16]. It guarantees that the number of working nodes in two different transfer
strategies is equal. According to above discussion, we have

A Reliable Transmission Strategy in Unreliable Wireless Sensor Networks

381

Eelec-set = Eelec-single

(5)

Where Eelec-set denotes the Eelec of Set Transfer, and Eelec-single denotes the Eelec of Single
Link Transfer.
It is important that Set Transfer’s one nodes-set only use one node to relay packets
(see Set Relaying 3.3), which guarantees that
ERF-set = ERF- single

(6)

First consider the links are reliable, according to (3) ~ (6), we get
EPP_set_reliable = Eelec-set + ERF-set + n Eprocess
= Eelec-single + ERF- single + n Eprocess
≈ EPP_single_reliable

(7)

Where n is the average number of nodes-set.
Second consider the links are unreliable, re-transmission is needed. As section 2
mentioned, the PRR of Single Link Transfer is Pr, and Set Transfer is Pset. Then
through computing the expectation of transmissions, we get
EPP_set_unreliable =

1

EPP_set_reliable

(8)

pset

EPP_single_unreliable =

1

EPP_single_reliable

(9)

pr

According to equations (7) (8) (9), we have
EPP_set ≈

pr

EPP_single

(10)

pset
If the pr is 0.7 and pset ≈ 1, then EPP_set ≈ 0.7EPP_single. Obviously, Set Transfer
improved the energy efficiency of the networks with unreliable links.

5 Simulations and Comparisons
In this section, we first study the reliability of Set Transfer through numerical
experiments, and second study the performance of Set Transfer through simulations.
In numerical experiments, each link is assigned a value of Pr (0.1~0.6: 30%;
0.6~0.9: 70%), and then study the packet lost rate with scales in the number of nodes. It
can be seen from Fig.3 that the curve about Set Receiving has the shape of log functions, and six or more nodes could have reliable one-hop transmission in this unreliable
environment. In Fig.4, the number of working sensors in receiving set is fixed at 3 and
the Pr is changed. As Fig.4 shows, 3 nodes Set Receiving improve the transmission’s
reliability significantly. The curve of Set Receiving changes smoothly, and when the Pr
is 0.9~1, the 3 nodes Set Receiving nearly do not lost any packets.
In the simulations, 250 nodes are randomly deployed in a 200m×200m square area.
The radio model ([4]) with three distinct reception regions: connected, transitional and
disconnected is used. To simplify the simulation, each reception region has a random
PRR (packet reception rate), such as connected (0~11m): 0.9~1, transitional

382

Z. Wu and S. Li

(11m~32m): 0.5~0.7 30%, 0.7~0.9 70%, transitional (32~40m): 0.1~0.6 70%, 0.6~0.9
30%, disconnected (>40m): 0. Four transmission mechanisms are compared: ETX
transmission in [7]; Optimized GF transmission in [6]; Lazy loss detection transmission
in [5]; Set Transfer transmission as proposed in this paper.

Fig.5 shows the energy efficiency of various transmission strategies. The average
consumed energy of transmitting 1000 data packets successfully is observed. The
end-to-end distance is described by hop counts. If just use original ETX metric to
choose the next hop node, each hop distance will be too short to acquire good energy
efficiency. So ETX strategy is slightly adjust like this: using ETX metric to choose the
next hop node in a set of nodes. The power consumptions of each node in receiving,
transmitting modes are 14.4mW and 36mW respectively [17]. From Fig.5, Set Transfer
improves the energy efficiency of networks significantly. It is mainly because Set
Transfer can provide reliable transmission which saves retransmission energy. In
simulation, the results of each test of the ETX, Optimized GF and Lazy detection are
changed acutely. For example, the E_ETX (6hops) changed from 806.3W*S to
1498.6W*S, although the average consumed energy is 932.9 W*S. The link’s unreliability results in this acutely changing, and single link methods all have this problem.
However, the Set Transfer has no this problem. The E_Set (6hops) changed from

553.008 W*S to 576.776 W*S, and the average consumed energy is 561.336 W*S.
This phenomenon further reflects that the links Set Transfer provided is reliable and the
energy Set Transfer consumed is smooth.
Fig.6 shows the average end-to-end delay time of various transmission strategies.
From Fig.6, the delay time of Set Transfer is obviously shorter than single link strategies. Through providing more reliable transmission than single link strategies, Set
Transfer can effectively reduce the packet loss which will cause cascading effects, such
as ACK delay, retransmitting, and so on.

6 Conclusion
The unreliable wireless links in real sensor networks will decrease the performance of
networks seriously. In this paper, through studying the characteristics of the wireless
links deeply, we proposed a multi-nodes cooperation strategy Set Transfer, which
provides reliable transmission over unreliable links meanwhile improve the energy
efficiency of networks. Further theoretical and experimental analysis gives us some
insights on the improvements in energy efficiency that cooperation can bring to networks when the underlying links are unreliable.
