Abstract
The trans and gauche rotamers of 1,2-dihalogenodisilanes (XSiH2SiH2X; X=F, Cl, Br and I) have been studied in the gas phase
using theoretical methods. The transition state arising from the trans-gauche isomerisation has also been modelled. The methods
used are second order Møller-Plesset theory (MP2) and density functional theory (DFT). The basis set used is 6-311++G(d,p) for
all atoms except that 6-311G(d,p) has been used for iodine atom only. B3LYP is the functional used for the DFT method and
G2/MP2 and CCSD(T) computations have also carried out using the MP2 optimised structures. All the computations have been
done using Gaussian 03W. All the structures have been fully optimised and the optimised geometries, dipole moments, moment
of inertia and energies are reported. Energies of the optimised structures have been used to obtain the energy difference between
the trans and gauche rotamers and the barrier of rotation. The optimised structures have been used for computations of vibrational
frequencies and these frequencies are reported with appropriate assignments. It is found that the trans conformers are preferred
and both the energy difference and rotational barrier increase as the size of the halogen increases. These observations have been
interpreted in terms of steric or electrostatic repulsion and antiperiplanar hyperconjugation supported with NBO analysis. The
findings from this work have also been compared with the analogous 1,2-dihalogenoethanes. Some of the predicted parameters
compare satisfactorily with those reported in literature. The theoretical rate constant for the trans rotamer-transition state
isomerisation is reported for the first time for this type of interconversion. The literature for these compounds is limited in terms
of conformational investigations and therefore the data from this work should serve as a useful set for reference.

due to restricted rotation about the carbon-carbon single bond [7], 1,2-disubstituted ethanes are known to exist as a
mixture of two rotational isomers namely the trans and gauche rotamers, Fig 1. In general, the trans rotamer is more
stable and this has usually been associated with steric repulsion between the adjacent halogen atoms in the gauche
rotamer [8]. However, this simple explanation fails to account for the gauche rotamer to be more stable in the case
of 1,2-difluoroethane [9]. The unusual behaviour of 1,2-difluoroethane has been associated with gauche effect and
has been explained using hyperconjugation [10]. Todate, it is now known that stability of a given rotamer depends
on competition between classical steric or electrostatic repulsion and antiperiplanar hyperconjugation.

In 2008, Souza et al. [10] used theoretical methods to study the stereoelectronic effects governing the rotational
isomerism of 1,2-dihaloethanes. They found that in 1,2-dichloroethane, steric or electrostatic repulsion and
hyperconjugative interactions are competitive leading to the trans rotamer being more stable. However, the anti
periplanar electron delocalisation favours the trans rotamer for 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2-diiodoethane. 1,2Disubstituted disilanes, being structurally analogous to 1,2-disubstituted ethanes, are expected to behave similarly.
However the polarities of the CH and SiH bonds are opposite and hence this might have influence of the structures
and energies of 1,2-disubstituted disilanes compared to their carbon analogues. In spite of this difference, it is worth
to point out that 1,2-disubstituted disilanes have not been comparably studied. One of the motivations of this work is
derived from the limited literature of 1,2-disubstituted disilanes, in particular the 1,2-dihalogenodisilanes, in terms
of conformational investigations. A brief survey of literature has been helpful is setting the objectives of this work.
There has always been interest in the preparation and characterisation of halogenodisilanes [11], although they
are known to be difficult to synthesise. In 1995, Hassler et al. [12] synthesised halogenated silanes XnSi2H6-n (X=F,
Cl, Br and I) and they investigated their infrared and Raman spectra and 29Si-NMR-spectra. In 2001, Gupper and
Hassler [13] reported the synthesis and properties of 1,2-dichlorodisilane and 1,1,2-trichlorodisilane. They found
that both the disilanes are stable for weeks at room temperature but undergo rapid hydrogen or chlorine exchange
reactions and cleavage of the Si-Si bond on the addition of traces of catalysts such as aluminium chloride. They
concluded from the infrared and Raman vibrational spectra that both the chlorodisilanes exist as mixtures of gauche
and trans rotamers in the liquid state. In 1991, Røhmen and coworkers [14] reported the molecular structures of 1,2diiododisilane and 1,1,2,2-tetraiododisilane using gas-phase electron diffraction data. They found that 1,2diiododisilane exists as the gauche and anti rotamers with the anti rotamer being more stable and the percentage of
the trans rotamer being 76. Further, they reported the conformational energy difference between these rotamers to be
0.3 kcal/mol. However in 2001, Johansen and coworkers [15] reinvestigated the molecular structures and vibrational
properties of 1,2-diiododisilane and 1,1,2,2-tetraiododisilane by gas-phase electron diffraction, temperature
dependent Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio molecular orbital and density functional computations. It should be
noted that the 3-21G* basis set has been used for computations for iodine atom but more extensive basis sets are
now available [16]. More recently, in 2004, Hassler et al. [17] reported a Raman spectroscopic study of the
conformer stabilities in 1,2-dichlorodisilane and 1,1,2-trichlorodisilane and the respective d4 and d3 isotopomers.
They found that these disilanes exist as mixtures of conformers, trans and gauche, in the gaseous and liquid phases.
They also reported ab initio computations at the HF, MP2 and DFT/B3LYP levels using 6-311G(d) as the basis set.
Therefore it can be found that although the rotamers of 1,2-dichlorodisilane (2) and 1,2-diiododisilanes (4) have
been investigated. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been theoretical conformational studies with respect
to 1,2-difluorodisilane (1) and 1,2-dibromodisilane (3). Further, the studies involving (2) and (4) have been limited
to molecular structures, energy difference between trans and gauche conformers and vibrational spectra but,

surprisingly, a important parameter for internal rotation namely rotational barrier has not been investigated. In view
of above, and in continuation with our studies [1-6], the objectives of the present work are to study the molecular
structures, energies, rotational barriers and infrared vibrational spectra of the 1,2-dihalogenodisilanes, (1)-(4), using
theoretical methods in the gas phase. The findings of this research work are hereby reported.
2. Computational methods
All MP2 and DFT/B3LYP computations have been used for molecular geometry optimisation of the trans and
gauche rotamers of the 1,2-dihalodisilanes (1)-(4). The gauche and trans rotamers have been considered in the C2
and C2h point group respectively. The transition state for the trans-gauche isomerisation is the conformer in the C2
point group with a dihedral angle of 120°. The basis set used for all atoms is 6-311++G(d,p) except that 6-311G(d,p)
has been used for iodine atom only. G2/MP2 and CCSD(T) computations have also carried out using the MP2/6311++G(d,p) optimised structures. Frequency computations have been carried out using the optimised structures in
order to provide a complete description of the molecular motions involved in the normal modes. All computations
have been done using Gaussian 03W [18] program suite and GaussView [19] has been used for visualising the
rotamers.
The energy difference (∆E) between the trans and gauche rotamers has been calculated as:
Energy (gauche rotamer) - Energy (trans rotamer)
(1)
The rotational barrier has been calculated as:
Energy (transition state rotamer) - Energy (trans rotamer)
(2)
Natural bond orbital (NBO) parameters were computed using the NBO module [20] implemented in
Gaussian 03W.
The rate constant for the isomerisation process is determined using a modified expression commonly used for
bimolecular reactions [20-23]. The rate constant for a bimolecular reaction is calculated using conventional
transition state theory (TST) with the Wigner tunneling coefficient [20,24]. According to the standard Eyring TST,
the rate constant, k, is obtained as:

k =Γ

⎛ − ΔE a ⎞
⎟
RT ⎠

kbT QTS N A ⎜⎝
e
h Q1Q2

(3)

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant; h is Planck’s constant, T is the temperature; R is the ideal gas constant; NA is the
Avogadro’s number; QTS, Q1 and Q2 are the total partition functions of the transition state and reactants,
respectively; ΔEa is the activation barrier for the reaction and Γ is the tunneling coefficient. The total partition
function Q, is the product of the electronic, vibrational partition function, translational and rotational partition
functions.
3. Results and discussion
All the relevant structural optimised structures, namely bond length, torsional angle, dipole moment and moment of
inertia of the trans and gauche rotamers of the 1,2-dihalodisilanes (1)-(4) are reported in Table 1. Several
conclusions can be drawn from Table 1. Firstly, there is little difference between the values of the different
parameters obtained using the two methods of theory. Secondly, there is a good comparison between some of the
calculated parameters and available literature data for the rotamers of 1,2-diiododisilane Thirdly, the torsional angles
calculated for the gauche rotamers are generally greater from B3LYP than MP2 computations. Fourthly, the dipole
moments calculated for the gauche rotamers are generally greater from MP2 than B3LYP computations with the
dipole moment of the trans rotamers being zero. Lastly, the moment of inertia calculated for the rotamers is
generally greater from B3LYP than MP2 computations with IA >> IB ≈ IC. Apart from these, from (1) to (4), it is
interesting to note the systematic increase in the Si-X bond length with the Si-H bond length remaining almost
constant but the Si-Si bond length decreasing slightly. Natural bond orbital analysis indicates that the σSiSi bonds in
the rotamers involve equal contribution from the two silicon atoms with each silicon atom being, as expected, sp3
hybridised. However, the percentage of the p character increasing slightly from (1) to (3) but decreases in (4). The
structural parameters for these 1,2-dihalogeno disilanes differ from their carbon analogues [1,9] basically due to
silicon atom being larger in size compared to the carbon atom and this results in the different bond lengths being

longer. Further, the gauche conformers of the 1,2-dihalogeno disilanes are less polar than their carbon analogues [7]
as silicon is less electronegative than carbon.

311+G(3df,2p) energy can be obtained and they are included. Table 3 reports the energy of the transition state
rotamers arising from the trans-gauche isomerisation. Some conclusions can be drawn from tables 2 and 3. Firstly,
for the title compounds, the trans rotamers are more stable than the gauche forms. Secondly, the energy difference
between the rotamers increases as the size of the halogen increases. Thirdly, the rotational barrier is generally larger
from MP2 than B3LYP computations. The rotational barriers are larger than energy differences between the
rotamers but the differences are not large and hence the rotamers can be easily interconverted.

These observations may be explained and supported with interaction energies and NBO analysis. The
antiperiplanar hyperconjugative interactions energies (>2.09 kJ/mol) for the rotamers of (1)-(4) are summarised in
Table 4. It seems that for the title compounds, the steric effect dominates over antiperiplanar σSiH→σ*SiX
hyperconjugations and hence the trans rotamer gets more stabilised with respect to the gauche rotamer. Further, the
increase in (∆E) for (1)-(4) can be explained in terms of steric effect and an increase in σSiX→σ*SiX and LPX →σ*SiX
interactions. It is to be noted that the gauche effect in 1,2-difluoroethane is attributed to the larger antiperiplanar
σCH→σ*CF hyperconjugation (18.79 kJ/mol) with least steric effect [10]. The increase in rotational barrier from (1)
to (4) can be understood in terms increasing synperiplanar σSiH→σ*SiX interactions. These different interactions are
less compared to their carbon analogues [10] and this is one of the reasons for the lower energy difference and
rotational barrier of the 1,2-dihalogenodisilanes. In the literature, there is no data for rotational barrier of the1,2dihalogenodisilanes for comparison.

The calculated infrared raw vibrational frequencies, their intensities and assignments of the trans and gauche
rotamers of 1,2-dihalodisilanes (1)-(4) are presented in Tables S1-S4, (available as supplementary materials from the
author), respectively. The 24 modes of vibrations account for the irreducible representations Γv = 8Ag + 5Au + 4Bg +
7Bu of the C2h point group of the trans rotamers and Γv = 13A + 11B of the C2 point group of the gauche rotamers.
As expected, Ag and Bg vibrational modes of the trans rotamers are infrared inactive. Some experimental vibrational
wave numbers are also included for comparisons for the rotamers (2), (3) and (4) and it is interesting to note the
close predictions from the two methods and the computed values. These vibrational parameters can serve to be
useful for the characterisations of the rotamers of the title compounds.
In this work, the isomerisation can be regarded as a unimolecular process as it involves only one reactant, the
trans rotamer, and the transition state. Therefore, the partition function Qtrans of the trans rotamer and QTS of the
transition state are adopted when computing the rate constant in light of TST;

k =Γ

k b T QTS ⎜⎜⎝

The total partition function was calculated as a product of the individual partition functions; translational,
vibrational, electronic and rotational partition functions. The vibrational partition functions were evaluated with the
quantum harmonic approximation and the calculated rate constants are summarized in table 5. A general conclusion
from table 5 is that the rate constant for the trans rotamer-transition state isomerisation decreases as the halogen
increases in size.

4. Conclusion
This paper reports the gas phase theoretical study of the trans and gauche rotamers of 1,2-dihalogenodisilanes
(1)-(4) using theoretical methods in the gas phase. The optimised molecular structures and infrared raw vibrational
frequencies of the rotamers are presented. The rotational barrier and related thermodynamic parameters are also
reported. The trans rotamers are more stable and both the energy difference between the rotamers and the rotational
barrier increase with the halogen becoming larger in size. The results obtained have been interpreted in terms of
steric or electrostatic interactions and antiperiplanar hyperconjugation supported with natural bond orbital analysis.
An interesting outcome of this work is that some of the computed parameters compare satisfactorily with
experimental literature data and thus the results for the title compounds could serve as a reliable set of reference as

their literature in terms of conformational analysis is limited. Apart from these, the rate constant for the trans
rotamer-transition state isomerisation is reported for the first time for this type of interconversion.
