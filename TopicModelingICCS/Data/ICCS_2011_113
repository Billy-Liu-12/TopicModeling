Abstract
This paper presents an extension of the Hull-White model for stochastic volatility. It considers a two-dimensional
case where returns of two assets are correlated. The main objective is to estimate the volatility of each asset online
given the observation of the returns of the asset prices, taking account the correlation between the asset prices. We
propose recursive filtering equations derived from the results of Jazwinski [8] and Maybeck [12] for the estimation.
Keywords: Two-dimensional Hull-White model, stochastic volatility, state space modeling, nonlinear filtering,
conditional moment estimator, Monte Carlo simulation

1. Introduction
It has been widely known that volatility plays a big role in risk management and in pricing of asset derivative as it
explicitly appears as one of important variable in the celebrated Black-Scholes-Merton model [4, 13] for pricing European call option. However, the stylized fact of the option prices suggests that the volatility itself should be stochastic
as opposed to the constant volatility used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Various alternative econometric models
have instead been proposed, including stochastic ones. One popular model is due to Hull and White [7] which extends
the Black-Scholes-Merton model by letting the volatility itself be modeled as a diﬀusion process.
Unlike asset prices, the volatility is not observable in the financial market. One immediate question arises is can
we estimate the volatility, preferably online, as we gather the asset prices?. This is a filtering problem, which in
general can be of nonlinear type and infinite dimensional one.
In the multivariate econometric setting this question was answered among others by Harvey et al. [6] using
Bayesian technique. However, this approach induces some diﬃculties as the evolution of the state variable - representing the asset prices and their volatilities - and the observations requires the solution of functional integral diﬀerence
equations. This implies that the general optimal filter obtained will be infinite dimensional, and hence a closed form
solutions to the estimation problem is not available, and therefore the calibration of the model may be diﬃcult.

In this paper, we consider an extension of the Hull-White model for stochastic volatility to a two-dimensional
case where returns of two asset prices are correlated. The main objective is to estimate the volatility of each asset,
preferably online, as we gather the returns of the asset prices, taking account the correlation structure between them.
We propose recursive equations derived from the results of Jazwinski [8] and Maybeck [12] for the estimation. In the
case there is no correlation between the asset prices, the estimation can be performed separately for each stock. See
among others the works of Nielsen et al. [15] and Bagchi and Aihara [1]. By taking account the correlation structure
between the asset prices, we observe that the proposed filtering equations seem to work better than those when there
is no correlation. This empirical findings suggest that the correlation may improve the estimation results.
The organization of this paper is as follows. We formulate the two-dimensional Hull-White model for stochastic
volatility and its filtering problem in Section 2. The details of the proposed recursive filtering equations are outlined
in Section 3. Section 4 discusses Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic volatility model and the filtering results.
Maximum likelihood estimation of the Hull-White model is done by passing it through the approximate filtering
equations. The results of the MLE parameters estimation are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes this paper.
2. Problem formulation
Before we state the extended Hull-White stochastic volatility model, let us denote by w = (w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 ) ∈ R4
four-dimensional Brownian motions defined as usual on the filtered probability space (Ω, F , (F )t>0 , P), on which they
are adapted. These Brownian motions are used as the driving noises of two asset price processes as well as their
associated stochastic volatilities. We assume that these Brownian motions are correlated in the following way:
dw1t dw2t = ρZ1 Z2 dt,

dw1t dw3t = ρZ1 V1 dt,

dw2t dw4t = ρZ2 V2 dt.

(1)

Throughout this paper we denote by Zi (t), i = 1, 2, the log-return of the asset price i at time t and by Vi (t), i = 1, 2, the
volatility of the asset i at time t. Our extension of the Hull-White model for stochastic volatility is given by
1
dZ1 (t) = (μ1 − V1 (t))dt + V1 (t)dw1t , Z1 (0) = 0
2
1
dZ2 (t) = (μ2 − V2 (t))dt + V2 (t)dw2t , Z2 (0) = 0
2
dV1 (t) = β1 V1 (t)dt + κ1 V1 (t)dw3t ,
V1 (0) = V10
dV2 (t) = β2 V2 (t)dt + κ2 V2 (t)dw4t ,

(2)

V2 (0) = V20 .

In terms of the state space representation, the extended Hull-White volatility model (2) can be rewritten as follows

obtained at the sampling instants t1 < ... < ti < ... < tN , where N denotes the number of observations. The
interpretation of (4) is that we put some little noises into the asset price and consider this noise-corrupted prices
as the observations. The state space representation (3)-(4) extends the models of Bagchi and Aihara [1] and
Nielsen et al. [14] to the one in which the correlation between two asset prices are taken into consideration.
(ii) The Brownian motions wti = (w1ti , w2ti , w3ti , w4ti ) and the stochastic entities e1 (ti ) and e2 (ti ) are assumed to be
mutually independent for all ti .

Note that in the state space model (3) above, the Brownian motion wti may involve correlations between its
components: w1ti , w2ti , w3ti , and w4ti . However, we can rewrite the state space model (3) in terms of a standard Brownian
˜ whose components are independent. By doing so, the state space model (3) can be rewritten as follows:

3. Continuous-discrete time nonlinear filtering equations
As mentioned in the points (i) and (ii) above that our main interest is to estimate the return Zi (t) of the asset
price, in particularly, the stochastic volatility Vi (t) based on the discrete-time observation Yti (4) obtained at sampling
instants t1 < · · · < ti < ti+1 < · · · < tN . Mathematically speaking, we are interested in evaluating the time propagation
of the conditional mean and variance of the state process X(t) := Z1 (t), Z2 (t), V1 (t), V2 (t) based on the observation
Yti , i.e., we want to evaluate the following conditional expectations:
ˆ t|ti

E X(t)| Y(ti ) = Yi ,

for all t ∈ [ti , ti+1 ) between sample times ti and ti+1 , as generated for a particular observation history realization Y(ti ).

Now it seems that we already have a usual filtering problem for the dynamical system (3) with discrete-time
observation (4). However, for the above system we can not formulate the usual filtering problem because the driving
noise of the dynamical system is a state-dependent function or in other words the diﬀusion function depends on the
signal process V(t). This is a so-called continuous-discrete time nonlinear filtering problem. The method of solving
the problem relies on the fact that both the marginal and Y(ti )−conditional densities of the state process X(t) satisfy
Kolmogorov equations between sample times [ti , ti+1 ), and uses the Hilbert optimal projection method in L2 to get an
update of the estimation at time ti+1 . We refer to Jazwinski [8] and Maybeck [12] for further details of discussion.
Based on the solution method developed in [8] and [12], the recursive filtering equations for the two-dimensional

4. Monte Carlo simulation
In this section the estimation equations proposed in Section 3 will be tested on simulated data based on the twodimensional Hull-White model (2). An eﬃcient and widely applicable approach to solving stochastic diﬀerential
equations is to simulate the sample paths of a discrete-time approximation to the continuous-time model. For a given
discretization t0 = τ0 < ... < τn < τn+1 < ... < τN = T of the time interval [t0 , T ], an Euler approximation, see [9], of
the Hull-White model (2) is given by a continuous-time stochastic process satisfying the iterative scheme:

and

Vnk = V k (tn );

k = 1, 2,

for the value of the approximation at the discretization time τn . Note that the driving noises Δw1n , . . . , Δw4n are correlated Gaussian random variables having zero mean, whose correlation coeﬃcients are defined in the following way:
Δw1n Δw2n = ρZ1 Z2 Δt,

Δw1n Δw3n = ρZ1 V1 Δt,

Δw2n Δw4n = ρZ2 V2 Δt.

(19)

In our simulation studies, most of the time we consider equidistant discretization times
τn = t0 + nΔ,
with step size Δ = (T N−t0 ) for some integer N. The sequence {Znk , Vnk , k = 1, 2; n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N} of values of the Euler
approximation (15)-(18) at the time instants τn , n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N, can be computed in a similar way to those of the
deterministic case. The main diﬀerence is that we now need to generate the random increments
Δw˜ kn = w˜ kτn+1 − w˜ kτn ,

(20)

for k = 1, ..., 4 and n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N − 1, of the Brownian motion process w˜ kn = {wkt , t ≥ 0}. We know that these
increments are Gaussian random variables with mean E(Δw˜ kn ) = 0 and variance E((Δw˜ kn )2 ) = Δ.
We simulate the Hull-White model (3) using the Euler scheme (15)-(18) to obtain N = 1000 observations with
Δ = 0.01. The simulation results (stock price and true volatility) are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The interpretation
of these figures is the following. We can think of the true volatility as the true signal whereas the stock price being
the corrupted signal acting as the observation. The question we are interested in: can we extract the true signal back
from the corrupted one?. This sort of question is the one that we attempt to answer throughout this paper.
4.1. Simulation results
This section presents the results of the Monte Carlo simulation discussed above. The idea is to see whether the
proposed recursive filtering equations (9)-(14) work better when taking account the correlation structure between two
asset prices. For these simulation studies, we look at two cases: uncorrelated asset prices, i.e., the case when ρZ1 Z2 = 0
against correlated one. For the latter, we consider ρZ1 Z2 = 0.5.
The maximum likelihood identification of the system parameters is done for the correlated case only.
4.1.1. Uncoupled dynamics of two asset prices
For this case, the noise coming in the first stock price process Z1 (t) is assumed to be mutually independent of the
noise coming in the second stock price process Z2 (t). In this simulation we set
θ = μ1 ; μ2 ; κ1 ; κ2 ; β1 ; β2 ; ρZ1 Z2 ; ρZ1 V1 ; ρZ2 V2 ; Σ1 ; Σ2
= (0.08; 0.09; 0.001; 0.002; 5e − 07; 2e − 06; 0; 0.5; 0.6; 0.0014; 0.0017)
Z1 (0) =0, Z2 (0) = 0, V10 = 0.03, V20 = 0.04.
ˆ t1 |t0 and the associated variance Pt1 |t0 are provided by
We assume further that initial guesses of the state estimate X

Pt1 |t0 = 2e − 5I.

4.1.2. Coupled dynamics of two asset prices with ρZ1 Z2 = 0.5
For this case, the noise coming in the first stock price process Z1 (t) is assumed to be correlated with the noise
coming in the second stock price process Z2 (t) with correlation ρZ1 Z2 = 0.5. In this simulation we set the model
parameter having the following values
θ = μ1 ; μ2 ; κ1 ; κ2 ; β1 ; β2 ; ρZ1 Z2 ; ρZ1 V1 ; ρZ2 V2 ; Σ1 ; Σ2
= (0.08; 0.09; 0.001; 0.002; 5e − 07; 2e − 06; 0.5; 0.5; 0.6; 0.0014; 0.0017)
Z1 (0) =0, Z2 (0) = 0, V10 = 0.03, V20 = 0.04.
ˆ t1 |t0 and the associated variance
The same as before, we assume further that the initial guesses of the state estimate X
Pt1 |t0 are provided by
ˆ t1 |t0 = 0, 0, 0.0301, 0.00401 , Pt1 |t0 = 2e − 5I
X
In both models, I denotes an identity matrix. Figure 1 and Figure 2 display the simulation results of the asset
price processes and their corresponding stochastic volatility processes. From these figures, we notice that the filtering
equations provide good estimate of the return of the asset prices as they are able to capture the dynamics of the asset
prices. Comparing the estimation results for the volatility, we observe from these figures that when considering the
correlation between the asset prices the filtering equations seem to provide some improvements in the estimation.

4.2. Maximum likelihood estimation of the Hull-White model
In the previous sections we studied two-dimensional Hull-White dynamical models of stochastic volatility and
their associated filtering problems, under the assumption that the dynamical model is known a priori. This means that
the forms of the dynamical equations and the parameters appearing there are completely known. This section will
deal with some questions that arise when this assumptions no longer holds any more. This problem has its origin in
the statistical estimation theory. Our emphasis is on the method of maximum likelihood estimation. The method is
based on an assumption of normality for the innovation process given in the curly bracket in the equation (12):
ti (θ)

ˆ ti |ti−1 =
≡ Yti − Y

Yt1i
Yt2i

−

Xˆ 1ti |ti−1
Xˆ 2
ti |ti−1

.

(21)

The innovation process (21) is assumed to be independent random variable with zero mean and probability density
function f (εti (θ)) such that the conditional likelihood function L˜ may be expressed in terms of the prediction error
decomposition L(θ;FN ) =

N
i=1

f ( ti (θ)). We refer to Nielsen et al. [14] for further details. By assuming that the

innovation process is normal with zero mean and covariance matrix as given by the second matrix under the inverse
sign in the expression (14), it is convenient to consider the logarithm of L :
l(θ) = − ln L(θ;FN ),

(22)

such that the maximum likelihood estimate of the Hull-White model is determined by minimizing (22).
The results of the maximum likelihood parameter estimation are reported in Table 1. For each parameter, a t− test
is provided to verify whether the estimation results are unbiased. It is seen that the t− test shows that all parameters
are accepted on a 5% level, except for the parameters κ1 , β1 and ρZ2 V2 . This fact suggests that the biasedness of the
parameter κ1 and β1 is caused by the smoothing eﬀect of the filter, it is not the parameters κ1 and β1 that causes the
smoothing eﬀect. The test statistics for β1 and β2 are significant according to the accuracy of the estimates of both β1
and β2 , thus producing a very small standard deviation.
5. Concluding remarks
We have presented the two-dimensional Hull-White model for stochastic volatility where returns of two assets
are correlated. Under this framework, we desire to estimate the stochastic volatility as we gather the log-return of
the asset prices. Due to the nonlinearity nature of the problem, we propose approximate recursive filtering equations.
The proposed filtering equations seem to have been able to capture the dynamics of the simulated stochastic volatility
reasonably good, particularly when we allow correlation between the two asset prices under consideration. It may
have been possible to extend the current model to the multivariate case. However, as the computation may be time
consuming, we only discuss for two asset prices only. We keep this work for further research.
The identification of system parameters was done using the maximum likelihood method passed through the
filtering scheme. The results of the maximum likelihood parameter identification are reported in Table 1. For each
parameter, a t− test is provided to verify if the estimation results are unbiased. It is seen that except for the parameters
κ1 , β1 and ρZ2 V2 , the t− test shows that all parameters are accepted on a 5% level. This fact suggests that the biasedness
of the system parameter estimate may be caused by the smoothing eﬀect of the filter.
We have assumed throughout this paper that the dynamics of asset prices do not involve jumps which are opposed
to the one observed in real financial market. It has been common knowledge to model the innovation of the log-return
of the asset price by jump-diﬀusion processes. By doing this, the model of asset price is expected to be close to reality
as possible. But, there is no guarantee that the current proposed filtering will be able to cope with the estimation
problem since the underlying assumption on the asset price is entirely diﬀerent. This particular extension of the
current model to jump-diﬀusion processes has been considered in [18].
