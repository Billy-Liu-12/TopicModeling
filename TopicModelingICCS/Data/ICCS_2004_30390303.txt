Abstract. Solving inequalities is a very important topic in computational algebra. In fact, the most important computer algebra systems
include sophisticated tools for solving diﬀerent kinds of inequalities in
both symbolic and graphical ways. This paper presents a new Mathematica package, InequationPlot, for displaying the two-dimensional solution sets of several inequalities. In particular, it extends Mathematica’s
capabilities by providing graphical solutions to many inequalities (such

The output obtained is consistent with Mathematica’s notation and results and the package provides a similar output for those cases already
solved by Mathematica. The performance of the package is discussed by
means of several illustrative and interesting examples.

Introduction

Solving inequalities is a very important topic in Mathematics, with outstanding
applications in many problems of theoretical and applied science. Inequalities
play a key role simply because many problems cannot be completely and accurately described by only using equalities. However, since there is not a general methodolody for solving inequalities, their symbolic computation is still
a challenging problem in computational algebra. Depending on the kind of the
functions involved, there are many “specialized” methods such as those based
on cylindrical algebraic decomposition, Gr¨
oebner basis, quantiﬁer elimination,
etc. In addition, some “ad hoc” methods are to be implemented. The interested
reader is referred to [1,3,4,5,7] for an introduction to the ﬁeld. See also [8] for a
recent survey on geometric inequalities.
In spite of the diﬃculties mentioned above, the most important computer algebra systems (Mathematica, Maple, etc.) include sophisticated tools for solving

diﬀerent kinds of inequalities in both symbolic and graphical ways. However, the
problem is far from being solved in all its generality and, consequently, there is
still a long way to walk in order to tackle this issue.
This paper presents a new Mathematica package, InequationPlot, for displaying the two-dimensional solution sets of of several inequalities. In particular,
it extends Mathematica’s capabilities by providing graphical solutions to many
inequalities (such as those involving trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic
functions) that cannot be solved by using the standard Mathematica commands
and packages. The package also deals with inequalities involving complex variables by displaying the corresponding solutions on the complex plane. The output
obtained is consistent with Mathematica’s notation and results and the package provides a similar output for those cases already solved by Mathematica.
The performance of the package is discussed throughout the paper by means of
several illustrative and interesting examples.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the main standard Mathematica tools for solving inequalities. Then, Section 3 introduces the
new Mathematica package, InequationPlot, and describes the commands implemented within. The performance of the package is also discussed in this section by using some illustrative examples. In addition, we show some inequalities
that are solvable with our package while they cannot be solved by applying the
standard Mathematica kernel and packages. Finally, Section 4 closes with the
main conclusions of this paper and some further remarks.

Standard Mathematica Tools for Solving Inequalities

Mathematica incorporates a number of sophisticated commands and packages
for solving diﬀerent kinds of inequalities. For example, the Mathematica command Reduce[eqns,vars, elims] simpliﬁes equations trying to eliminate the variables elims. In this process, the command generates both equations and inequalities combined with the operators && (and) and || (or). In addition, Mathematica 3.0 includes a package, Algebra‘AlgebraicInequalities‘, for solving systems of strong polynomial inequalities [9]. In particular, the command
SemialgebraicComponents[{e1 , ..., en }, {x1 , ..., xm }] gives at least one point in
each connected component of the open semialgebraic set deﬁned by inequalities
{e1 , ..., en }, where both sides of each ei are polynomials in variables {x1 , ..., xm }
with rational coeﬃcients. This command is based on the cylindrical algebraic
decomposition algorithm (see, for instance, [2] and [6] for a description). In addition, the Mathematica 3.0 package Algebra‘InequalitySolve‘ provides the
solution set of an expression containing logical connectives and univariate polynomial equations and inequalities in a single or several variables. Other recent
commands to deal with this problem incorporated in Mathematica version 4.0
are described in [10]. That paper also discusses the main algorithms used in this
task.
The visualization of the solution sets of given systems of inequalities has
also been the subject of further research. For example, the add-on Mathematica

4.1 package Graphics‘InequalityGraphics‘ provides commands to visualize
logical combinations of polynomial and algebraic inequalities in two- and threedimensional real spaces (commands InequalityPlot and InequalityPlot3D
respectively). Some additional developments to ﬁnd real solutions of systems of
real equations and inequalities have also been recently incorporated into Mathematica version 5.0. For example, the command FindInstance can be used
to ﬁnd a real solution of a system of equations and inequalities. Even users can
directly apply the CylindricalDecomposition command to compute solutions
of certain kinds of inequalities.
However, there are several families of inequalities that cannot be solved by
using the standard Mathematica commands described above. This limitation can
easily be understood by analyzing the methods applied to solve those inequalities, mostly based on the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD). In this
decomposition, each S ⊂ IR n is represented as a ﬁnite union of disjoint cells.
The concept of cell applied here can be deﬁned as follows:
1. a cell in IR is either a point or an open interval
2. a cell in IR n+1 is either deﬁned by the set
{(x, y)/x ∈ C, f (x) < y < g(x)}

(1)

{(x, y)/x ∈ C, y = f (x)}

(2)

or the set
where x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ), C is a cell in IR n and f and g are either
a) continuous functions on C such that for some polynomials F and G we
have F (x, f (x)) = 0 and G(x, g(x)) = 0 or
b) ±∞
and f (x) < g(x), ∀x ∈ C.
Given a ﬁnite set F of polynomials in n variables, the CAD algorithm calculates an F -invariant1 cylindrical algebraic decomposition of IR n . This algorithm
is particularly well suited for obtaining the solution set of a system of polynomial
equations and inequalities for n variables. For example:
In[1]:= CylindricalDecomposition[xˆ 2 + yˆ 2 +zˆ 2 < 1,{x,y,z}]
√
√
Out[1] := {−1 < x < 1 && − 1 − x2 < y < 1 − x2 &&
− 1 − x2 − y 2 < z < 1 − x2 − y 2 }
Unfortunately, as will be shown later, inequalities involving trigonometric,
exponential or logarithmic functions cannot be decomposed in cells and, therefore, the CAD method can no longer be applied to those cases. The package
InequationPlot, described in the next section, overcomes this limitation and
allows the user to solve a large family of real and complex inequality systems
and equations and display their two-dimensional solution sets.

A cylindrical algebraic decomposition of a set S ⊂ IR n is said to be F -invariant if
each of the polynomials from F has a constant sign on each cell of that decomposition.

The Package InequationPlot: Some Illustrative
Examples

Inequalities involving trigonometric functions cannot be solved by applying the
CAD algorithm described in Section 2. For example, let us try to display the
solution sets of each of the inequalities
sin(x + y) >

1
2

(3)

and
sin(2x) + cos(3y) < 1

(4)

on the set [−8, 8] × [−8, 8] by using the standard Mathematica commands. In
this case, we must use the command InequalityPlot of the Mathematica 4.1
package:
In[2]:=<<Graphics‘InequalityGraphics‘
Unfortunately, since the region deﬁned by inequality (3) on the prescribed
domain cannot be broken down into cylinders, the CAD algorithm fails to give
the solution:
In[3]:=InequalityPlot[Sin[x + y] > 1/2, {x, -8, 8}, {y, -8, 8}]
Out[3] := InequalityP lot :: region :
The region deﬁned by sin(x + y) > 1/2
could not be broken down into cylinders.

−8 <= x <= 8

−8 <= y <= 8

The previous inequalities can be solved, however, by loading the package
developed by the authors:
In[4]:=<<InequationPlot‘
which includes the command
InequationPlot[ineqs, {x, xmin, xmax}, {y, ymin, ymax}, opts]
for displaying the two-dimensional region of the set of points satisfying the inequalities ineqs of real numbers inside the square [xmin, xmax] × [ymin, ymax],
which is actually the problem we are going to solve. For example, inequalities
(3)-(4) can be solved as follows:
In[5]:=InequationPlot[#, {x, -8, 8}, {y, -8, 8}, AspectRatio ->
Automatic]& /@ {Sin[x+y]>1/2, Sin[2 x]+Cos[3 y]<1}
Out[5]:= See Figure 1
Similarly, Fig. 2 displays the solution sets of the inequalities F (x) + F (y) = 1
and F (x2 ) + F (y 2 ) = 1 (where F stands for the ﬂoor function) on the squares
[−4, 4] × [−4, 4] and [−2, 2] × [−2, 2], respectively. We would like to remark that
the Mathematica command InequalityPlot does not provide any solution for
these inequalities either.

square [−4, 4] × [−4, 4]; (right) f loor(x2 ) + f loor(y 2 ) = 1 on the square [−2, 2] × [−2, 2]

The previous command, InequationPlot, can be generalized to inequalities
involving complex numbers. The new command
ComplexInequationPlot[ineqs, {z, {Rezmin, Rezmax}, {Imzmin, Imzmax}},
opts]

displays the solution sets of the inequalities ineqs of complex numbers inside the
square in the complex plane given by [Rezmin, Rezmax] × [Imzmin, Imzmax].

In this case, the functions appearing within the inequalities need to be realvalued functions of a complex argument, e.g. Abs, Re and Im. For example:
In[6]:=ComplexInequationPlot[#,{z,{-2, 3},{-3, 3}}, AspectRatio->
Automatic]& /@ {1<Abs[zˆ 2-z+1]<4, 1<Abs[zˆ 2-2z]/Abs[zˆ 2+3]<4}
Out[6]:= See Figure 3

||z 2 − 2z||
Im(z) ∈ [−3, 3]: (left) 1 < ||z 2 − z + 1|| < 4; (right) 1 <
<4
||z 2 + 3||

We would like to point out that the output obtained from the package is
consistent with Mathematica’s notation and results and the package provides a
similar output for those cases already solved by Mathematica. Figure 4 illustrates this fact: on the left, the solutions provided by the standard Mathematica
command InequalityPlot to the inequalities x2 + y 2 ≤ 8 y 2 ≤ 2x (top) and
x2 − y 2 ≥ 1 (x2 − 1)3 y 2 ≤ 1 (bottom) on [0, 3] × [−3, 3] and [−3, 3] × [−2, 2]
respectively are displayed. On the right, the solutions obtained by using the new
command InequationPlot are shown. As the reader can see, the new solution
sets match perfectly those obtained from the standard Mathematica commands.

InequationPlot.

The last example aims to show how complicated the inequality systems can
be: in addition to include exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions,
combinations and even compositions of these (and other) functions can also be
considered. In Figure 5 the solutions sets of the inequality systems:

Conclusions and Further Remarks

In this paper a new Mathematica package, InequationPlot, to solve real and
complex inequalities and display their associated two-dimensional solution sets is
introduced. The package extends Mathematica’s capabilities by providing graphical solutions to many inequalities (such as those involving trigonometric,
exponential and logarithmic functions) that cannot be solved by using the standard Mathematica commands and packages. The performance of the package
has been illustrated by means of several interesting examples. In all the cases,
the output obtained is consistent with Mathematica’s notation and results and
the package provides a similar output for those cases already solved by Mathematica. Perhaps the weakest feature of the package is the computation time,
which is substantially higher than that usually required by Mathematica for solving the common cases. Further work will be developed in order to decrease this
computation time and also to extend our results to the three-dimensional case.
The obtained results will be reported elsewhere.
