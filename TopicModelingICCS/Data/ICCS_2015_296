Abstract
We examine a High Order / Low Order (HOLO) approach for a z-level ocean model and show
that the traditional semi-implicit and split-explicit methods, as well as a recent preconditioning
strategy, can easily be cast in the framework of HOLO methods. The HOLO formulation
admits an implicit-explicit method that is algorithmically scalable and second-order accurate,
allowing timesteps much larger than the barotropic time scale. We show how HOLO approaches,
in particular the implicit-explicit method, can provide a solid route for ocean simulation to
heterogeneous computing and exascale environments.

Introduction

The High-Order / Low-Order (HOLO) approach is a moment-based, scale-bridging algorithm
where the coarse scale (LO) problem is obtained via moment integration and is used to accelerate
the ﬁne scale (HO) problem. The dimensionality of this LO problem is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the HO problem and, therefore, the LO system is far less expensive to solve. The HOLO
approach provides multigrid-like algorithmic acceleration: the LO problem solver relaxes long
wavelength components of the solution, while the HO problem solver relaxes short wavelength
components. These methods accelerate solution convergence by alternating the solution of the
HO system and a LO system, which are forced to remain discretely consistent (down to the
level of truncation error). The algorithmic idea builds on a well-deﬁned hierarchical description
(moments) of widely varying space and time scales.
The hierarchical nature of the algorithm lends itself readily to emerging architectures. The
algorithm exploits an isolation of scales, thus embracing multilevel parallelism and asynchrony.
Such scale isolation can allow for maximizing ﬂops with minimal data movement, thus providing

a key advantage as communication costs continue to dominate relative to ﬂoating point costs
in emerging architectures.
The HOLO approach has been very successful in plasma simulation [5, 4, 27], neutral partical
transport [16, 22], and thermal radiative transfer problems [23, 24]. In addition, the HOLO
concept has played a critical role in the co-design of numerical algorithms and their supporting
exascale implementations [1].
Accurate modeling of ocean circulation under various forcings is of great importance, and
impacts a variety of political decisions. In particular, it has been shown that high resolution is necessary for an accurate simulation of long-time ocean thermohaline circulation [18].
Scientists are currently performing ocean simulations with semi-implicit [6] and split-explicit
methods [9, 11]. Typically, these methods utilize a barotropic-baroclinic splitting that isolates fast (barotropic) and slow (baroclinic) time scales. The faster external gravity waves
(or barotropic motions) are independent of depth, and thus two dimensional, while the slower
baroclinic motions are fully three dimensional. For most problems of interest, explicit time
discretizations are impractical for these systems, due to short timesteps imposed by the fast
waves.
Methods based on barotropic-baroclinic splitting can easily be cast in the framework of
HOLO methods. Indeed, the semi-implicit (SI) method utilized in the Parallel Ocean Program
(POP) [6, 26] and split-explicit (SE) methods utilized in Model for Prediction Across Scales
(MPAS) [25] and Modular Ocean Model (MOM) [21] are characterized by a LO barotropic
system obtained by vertical moment of the HO baroclinic continuity and momentum equations.
Recently, HOLO has been exploited as a preconditioner for fully-coupled, fully-implicit ocean
models. Fully implicit approaches have been sought to remove timestep stability restrictions,
enhance numerical accuracy, and by the need for high spatial resolution. One advantage of
these methods is that relatively large timesteps can be taken without sacriﬁcing second-order
accuracy. A disadvantage, however, is that fully-implicit methods require a non-linear solution
for each timestep. The strategy outlined in [19] eﬀectively preconditions the fully coupled
HO system by only inverting the LO system. Algorithmic scalability is aﬀorded by multigrid
methods.
Another approach is that of an implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods [3, 7, 14]. This approach is
motivated by the successful implementation of an iterated IMEX method for radiation hydrodynamics problems [12, 13], related work on sea-ice modeling [17] and plasma physics [5, 4]. In this
particular class of IMEX methods, the two dimensional scalar continuity LO equation is treated
implicitly with preconditioned JFNK, and the remaining three dimensional HO equations are
driven by the LO barotropic solution and subcycled explicitly within the JFNK residual evaluation. Thus, the fast barotropic physics are treated implicitly while the slower baroclinic
physics are treated explicitly. When implemented appropriately, the HOLO approach allows
for an algorithmically scalable, second-order time integration, with timesteps much larger than
methods with timesteps restricted by the barotropic time scale.
Explicit treatment and subcycling of the HO problem allow larger LO timesteps to be
taken, and also allow a avenue of communication minimization (see §3.4). Therefore, HOLO
approaches, in particular the IMEX method, can provide a solid route for ocean simulation to
heterogeneous computing and exascale environments by minimizing communication [20], since
communication costs continue to grow and are becoming dominant relative to ﬂoating point
costs (see §3.4).
The manuscript is organized as follows: we present a mathematical formulation of HOLO
for a z-level ocean model in §2, draw attention to some speciﬁc HOLO approaches for ocean
modeling in §3, and make comparison of some of the recent approaches in terms of accuracy,

The fastest time scale associated with (1)–(3) and (8) is the barotropic timescale, due to

, with speed on order of 200 m/s. The baroclinic
the external gavity-wave, Δ tg = Δ x (gD)
timescale, Δ ta , is due to advection or dynamic time scales with speed on order of 10 m/s,
and is therefore much slower. The separation between these time scales presents diﬃculties for
time integration. Explicit methods are generally unstable for timesteps larger than the external
gravity-wave time scale.

The LO problem constitutes a 2-D scalar (rather than a 3-D vector) system. The HO problem is
given by (1)–(3) and (8). In addition, the physics associated with the external gravity-wave are
isolated to the LO system and removed from the HO system. The approximate decoupling of the
LO and HO systems allows for the independent time integration of each system separately, with
timestep size Δ tLO and Δ tHO , respectively. We note that the LO system has a CFL condition
associated with Δ tg , while the HO system has a CFL condition associated with Δ ta > Δ tg .
We also note that, upon temporal discretization, the LO system (12)–(13) can often be reduced
to an elliptic equation for η n+1 at the current timestep:
1
− ∇ · H∇ η n+1 = F (η, u),
τ

(15)

where τ is a function of timestep size, η, and u are are at previous timesteps (see [6] for
details). We note that with N horizontal mesh points, the HO problem (1)–(3) and (8) consists
of approximately 5 N K unknowns; while the LO problems (12)–(13) and (15) consist of 2 N
and N unknowns respectively. A comparison of cost for solving the HO and LO problems is
given in §4.2.

HOLO approaches for Ocean Modeling
Semi-implicit methods

The earliest example of an HOLO approach to ocean modeling is the semi-implicit (SI) method.
Typical SI methods treat the LO system implicitly using (15) with timesteps on order of the
baroclinic time scale, Δ tLO ≈ Δ ta , and the HO system explicitly with Δ tHO = Δ tLO . SI is the
approach of POP [6, 26]. The implementation in POP utilizes the conjugate gradient method
with Jacobi preconditioning for solution of (15) and a leapfrog scheme for time integration
of the HO system. POP has been used successfully for global, high resolution (0.1◦ ) ocean
modeling [29]. The SI method has an advantage over fully-explicit methods in that timesteps
larger than Δ tg can be readily utilized. In practice, SI can suﬀer from ﬁrst-order temporal
accuracy. The split-explicit method was developed to address these issues [25].

3.2

Split-explicit methods

The split-explicit (SE) algorithm is the current method used in the ocean community, e.g. in
MPAS [25] and MOM [21]. In contrast to SI, SE methods treat the LO system (12)–(13) with
explicit subcycling. For a single timestep of SE, the HO problem is integrated explicitly with
Δ tHO ≈ Δ ta and the LO problem is explicitly subcycled with Δ tLO ≈ Δ tg . In practice, the HO
and LO systems are coupled via a Picard iteration in order to achieve second-order temporal
accuracy [9, 11]. For each iteration, the HO coupling term is provided as a forcing term for the
LO problem. The LO problem is explicitly subcycled using a predictor-corrector scheme, and
upon completion a LO iterate is obtained. This iterate is used to integrate the HO problem
one step using the same predictor-corrector scheme to obtain a HO iterate. Upon convergence
of the Picard iteration, the solution to both the LO and HO problems at the new timestep is
found.

3.3

Fully-implicit methods with HOLO as a Preconditioner

The HOLO formulation has recently been utilized as a preconditioner for a fully implicit, secondorder time integration of (1)–(3) and (8). In this approach, the nonlinear system is solved using
a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method [15], with a physics-based preconditioner that
consists only of the LO system [19]. The JFNK framework allows tighter coupling of the physics,
thus reducing numerical errors and improving stability versus operator-splitting techniques.
The key to an eﬃcient implementation of JFNK is eﬀective preconditioning. In particular,
in [19] a physics-based preconditioner strategy was developed for ocean simulation based on
the HOLO formulation. The strategy outlined in [19] eﬀectively preconditions the HO system
by only inverting the LO system (15). In [19], it is shown that (15) can be approximately
inverted in a scalable way using multigrid methods [28]. Speciﬁcally, the implementation in [19]
utilizes the Trilinos NOX package for application of the JFNK method and the Trilinos ML [10]
package for approximate inversion of (15). The preconditioner is demonstrated to allow a stable
time integration with timesteps Δ tHO ≈ Δ ta while greatly reducing the number of GMRES
iterations required per Newton iteration.

3.4

Implicit-explicit methods

In the implicit-explicit (IMEX) approach, the LO problem (12) is treated implicitly with preconditioned JFNK and Δ tLO > Δ ta , and the HO problem is driven by the LO solution and
2090

subcycled explicitly within the JFNK residual evaluation with Δ tHO ≈ Δ ta . This approach is
known as nonlinear elimination, since the HO equations are eliminated from the the implicit
nonlinear residual. After this nonlinear elimination, the resulting nonlinear system consists
only of the LO equation [5, 30].
For a single timestep of IMEX, a nonlinear LO problem (12) must be solved. The JFNK
solution procedure requires that the LO problem be evaluated for each GMRES iteration. To
evaluate the LO problem, the HO problem is explicitly subcycled with a predictor-corrector
scheme given the current LO iterate such that a suitable second-order velocity is obtained. The
LO velocity u is computed from the HO solution via (11) and provided to the LO problem.
Upon convergence of JFNK, a solution to both the LO and HO problems at the new timestep
is obtained. We note that the subcycling process is executed for every linear iteration, and
thus eﬀective preconditioning is a vital requirement to minimize the total number of function
evaluations per LO timestep. The preconditioner for the LO system is formulated as (15),
hence the same preconditioner as in [19] is used (see §3.3). The associated Krylov vector and
nonlinear machinery reside in the LO space. Hence, IMEX requires a smaller memory footprint
over fully-implicit methods.
In the SE method, the HO system is advanced with a long timestep, Δ tHO , and the LO
system is subcycled with short timesteps, Δ tLO , restricted by a barotropic CFL limit, within
a single HO timestep. Hence, Δ tLO < Δ tHO necessarily. The SI method utilizes one implicit
LO timestep within the HO system, thus Δ tLO = Δ tHO . The IMEX approach diﬀers from the
traditional SE and SI approaches because the LO system is advanced implicitly and the HO
system is explicitly subcycled within the LO system. This allows Δ tLO > Δ tHO while providing
a stable time integration strategy.
In parallel, Δ tLO > Δ tHO provides a route to a communication-avoiding algorithm. In
modern and evolving computer architectures, communication will be the dominant bottleneck.
A communication staging strategy has been designed to minimize communication within the
explicit HO solver by reducing the frequency of halo exchanges per timestep. The strategy
increases the communication halo width from its conventional value of 1 to a value based heuristically on the amount of subcycling required. For explicit methods, as in the case of the HO
solver, the required halo communication per timestep can be determined a priori. This allows
the algorithm to perform a single communication call for the HO system per LO timestep. This
technique results in signiﬁcant communication savings, at the expense of performing additional
computations within the extended halo.

Comparison of HOLO methods

We examine a fully-implicit (trapezoidal rule) method (TR-JFNK), SE, and IMEX on a prototype problem where the domain consists of a two dimensional inﬁnite channel discretized
horizontally with a C-grid ﬁnite volume scheme [2] with Δ x = 1.0 × 104 , K = 60, L = 5.0 × 106 ,
D = 5.0 × 103 , f = 1.0 × 10−4 . The ﬂuid is initially at rest, with an initial perturbation in η. In
addition, the initial condition for temperature is a linear distribution in depth with ϕ1,1 = 20.0
and ϕ1,60 = 10.0, combined with a perturbation in layers near the surface. The initial condition
for salinity is a linear distribution in depth with ϕ2,1 = 30.0 and ϕ2,60 = 26.0.

relative to the RK4 solution with Δ t = 1.875. Also shown is an exponential ﬁt to the convergence that clearly shows TR-JFNK-LU and RK2 to have second-order convergence and RK4
to have fourth-order convergence.

TR-JFNK (solid line), and TR-JFNK with application of preconditioner by the Trilinos algebraic multigrid package ML (TR-JFNK-ML, dotted line), and one SIMPLE sweep [8] (TRJFNK-ML-S, dashed-crossed line). The ﬁgure shows that, without preconditioning, the implicit
method only scales well with timesteps up to Δ tg , while eﬀective preconditioning allows ideal
algorithmic scaling with timesteps on order Δ ta .
Figure 1c shows the average number of GMRES iterations per Newton iteration as a function
of timestep size for TR-JFNK (solid line) and TR-JFNK-LU (dashed line). While the average
number of GMRES iterations per Newton iteration steadily increases for TR-JFNK, the number
of iterations increases more rapidly for timesteps larger than Δ tg . For TR-JFNK-LU, the
average number of GMRES iterations per Newton iteration remains constant for timesteps up
to Δ tg and increases modestly up to Δ ta . The advantage of preconditioning in terms of the
number of GMRES iterations is clearly shown. Algorithmic scalability of the method is a result
of the preconditioner greatly reducing GMRES per Newton for large timesteps.

The problem was repeated twice with ﬁner spatial and temporal resolution to demonstrate
scalability of the preconditioned implicit trapezoidal rule method. The ratio Δ t/Δ x was ﬁxed
for each problem to respect the dynamic time scale, with Δ t, Δ x and problem size given in
Table 2. Figure 1d shows cost in CPU seconds as a function of timestep size for the three
resolutions using TR-JFNK-ML-S (solid line) and second-order RK2 (dash-dotted line). The
ﬁgure clearly shows that the preconditioned implicit method CPU scales proportionally with
problem size and temporal resolution.
The results show that the HOLO formulation, utilized as a preconditioner for a fully-implicit
method, allows timesteps larger the gravity wave time-scale. In addition, the preconditioner
requires only the solution of the LO system. The preconditioner allows the implicit method cost
to scale as explicit methods, but with larger implicit timesteps, and is second-order accurate.

4.2

Split-explicit and implicit / explicit methods

The problem was repeated for SE and IMEX. Recall that subcycling of the HO component
of IMEX is required such that Δ tHO = Δ ta when Δ tLO > Δ ta , and subcycling of the LO
component of SE is required such that Δ tLO = Δ tg when Δ tHO > Δ tg . Algorithmic results
are presented in Figures 2a–2b. Note that in the ﬁgures the timestep axis refers to the outer
timestep: Δ tLO for IMEX and Δ tHO for SE.
Figure 2a shows error as a function of timestep size for IMEX (solid line) and SE (dotted
line) and clearly shows IMEX and SE to have second-order convergence. Note that SE shows
a transition zone between second-order slopes, which occurs at timesteps where subcycling
becomes active. The transition reﬂects the fact that the error is dominated by the smaller
(subcycling) timestep. Figure 2b shows total serial CPU time (both HO and LO components)
as a function of timestep size for IMEX and SE, and shows both methods scale well, although
IMEX costs more than SE over the range of timesteps. Note that the LO SE component costs
more and does not scale as well as the IMEX LO; and HO is the dominant cost in both SE
and IMEX. The algorithmic scability of the IMEX LO problem is achieved entirely by eﬀective
preconditioning. These results show that the IMEX algorithm is algorithmically scalable and
second-order accurate, with serial performance comparable to the split-explicit method.
When IMEX is implemented with an eﬀective communication staging strategy, cost of the
IMEX HO solver in parallel can be signiﬁcantly reduced. Most ocean models utilize domain
decomposition in the horizontal surface, with subdomains extruded vertically in depth. Thus
there is horizontal halo exchange (communication) required on each layer. Traditional singlehalo implementations perform a single halo exchange once per timestep or stage. Our communication staging strategy [20] aggregates the network communications of halo cells necessary
for multiple explicit updates by increasing the width of the halo band relative to the number
of staged timesteps. In our implementation, the halo width is increased and the necessary halo
communication for multiple timesteps is performed in advance at the beginning of the timestep,
followed by subcycled timesteps. This strategy particularly favors our IMEX method over SE,
due to the fact that IMEX subcycles the HO components over longer timesteps, rather than

subcycling the LO components over smaller timesteps.
Figures 2c–2d show weak scaling results to evaluate eﬀectiveness of the communication
staging strategy for both IMEX and SE, with Δ tHO = 900 (Δ tLO = Δ tg ) for SE and Δ tLO =
900 (Δ tHO = Δ ta ) for IMEX. With this choice of outer timestep size, the SE LO component
must be subcycled 30 times and the IMEX HO component must be subcycled 3 times. The
motivation for this problem is to compare the relative communication cost for IMEX and SE
for integration at large timesteps. The computations were performed on the Mustang system
at Los Alamos National Laboratory. To demonstrate network communication eﬀects, these
examples were run using one single-threaded MPI rank per node (one compute-core per node)
on 1–768 nodes in two weak scaling conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst conﬁguration, denoted 5% ﬁxes
the ratio of halo width to local vector length to 1 : 9, and the second conﬁguration, denoted
1%, ﬁxes the ratio to 1 : 49.
Figure 2c shows that the communication staging strategy reduces the relative communication
costs for IMEX by an order of magnitude over that of SE. Figure 2d shows the computation
time for SE and IMEX. The ﬁgure conﬁrms that, with computation rapidly becoming a ﬁxed
cost per method, choice of staged versus single-halo, and the halo size have signiﬁcant impact
on parallel performance. Figure 2d also shows that staging increased computational time for
SE, while reducing that of IMEX. We note that staging ameliorates the upturn communications
cost at the highest node-count, and that, in all test combinations, IMEX has a lower total time
than SE.
These results show that, with an eﬀective communication staging strategy and subcycling
of the HO problem, the IMEX method in a parallel environment can decrease the relative
communication by more than an magnitude over the split-explicit approach. This makes IMEX
ideally suited for heterogeneous massively-parallel environments, where communication costs

continue to grow and are dominant relative to ﬂoating-point costs. The increase in savings of
relative communication costs of the IMEX method over SE in the regime of large timesteps and
large number of nodes is made possible by the ability to subcycle the HO component within an
implicit treatment of the LO component.

Conclusions

In this manuscript, we have discussed how the traditional semi-implicit and split-explicit methods can be cast in the framework of HOLO methods. In particular, the HOLO formulation can
be used as a physics-based preconditioner for a fully-implicit method, allowing timesteps larger
than those restricted by the gravity wave in explicit methods, and allowing the method to scale
as that of explicit methods, but with larger implicit timesteps and second-order accuracy. Additionally, the HOLO formulation, when cast as an IMEX algorithm, is algorithmically scalable
and second-order accurate with serial performance comparable to the split-explicit method.
Moreover, in parallel and with an eﬀective communication staging strategy and subcycling of
the HO problem, the IMEX approach results in more than two orders of magnitude decrease
in relative communication cost versus the split-explicit approach, making IMEX ideally suited
for exascale environments.
