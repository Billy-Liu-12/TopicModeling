Abstract. We investigate the relation between investor sentiment and market returns
in Chinese Fuel Oil Futures Markets by Vector Autoregressions VAR model.
The sample period is from 5 September 2005 until 31 December 2006. Studies using
daily datum on sentiments of professional advisors and individual investors suggest
that past market returns are an important determinant of sentiment. Our evidence
supports that not individual but professional sentiment has predictive power for
returns. Extreme levels of sentiment do not possess any superiority in returns
predictability with the exception of the individual bottom sentiment. For 1-week, 2week and 4-week intervals, returns can weakly predict sentiment or changes.
Individual sentiment severs as a contrary indicator of returns in the followed week,
whereas we find no evidence for the other circumstance.
Keywords: Returns Predictability; Investor Sentiment; Vector Autoregressions.

1 Introduction
The sentiment-return relation is an important and extensively researched topic in the
finance literature. Indirect（ Market-based） [1], direct (survey-based) [2-4] or
integrated measures [5,6] of sentiment are popularly used in order to find out whether
sentiment follow or precede the stock markets. Several studies have also examined the
causality in the futures markets with similar measures and the conclusions are mixed.
Simon et al [7] find that sentiment measures are able to predict returns on futures.
Wang [8] shows that in the S&P 500 index futures market, large speculator sentiment
is a price continuation indicator, whereas large hedger sentiment is a contrary
indicator. Small trader sentiment can hardly forecast future market movements.

Moreover, extreme large trader sentiments and the combination of extreme large
trader sentiments tend to provide more reliable forecasts. Chen et al [9] reveal that
contrary sentiment indicators improve the forecasting accuracy and profits earning
capability in S&P 500 futures. However, Dwight et al [10] demonstrate that the
sentiment index displays only a sporadic and marginal ability to predict returns across
28 U.S. futures markets, and in those instances the pattern is one of return
continuation—not reversals.
This study researches the causality in Chinese Fuel Oil Futures Markets. The
primary focus is on the following two issues. Firstly, we test whether sentiment cause
returns as predicted by the noise trader literature or sentiment simply responds to
market behavior. Secondly, we examine whether extreme sentiment measures are
useful for forecasting returns. Lastly, for robustness, we also test the causality with
longer intervals.

2 Data and Sample Statistics
To empirically test our hypotheses, we use the results of a survey conducted by
Jianzheng Future Brokerage Co. Ltd to measure the sentiment on a daily basis. The
corporation gathers the opinions of above ten analysts, which form the professional
advisers group. It also polls a random sample of its members each day, at the size of
over one thousand, which represents the individual investors group. The sample
period is from 5 September 2005 until 31 December 2006 for a total of 302
observations. The Bearish Sentiment Index at time t （ BSI t ） is measured by the
bull-bear spread,1 the percentage of the bullish less that of the bearish.
A continuous series of futures return is created to match the sentiment data. The
return ( R t ) is measured as the percentage change in settlement prices ( Pt ) of the
contract which is three months before the delivery date using a roll-over strategy,
ln ( Pt / Pt − k ) . The data comes from Shanghai Futures Exchange.
It is necessary to examine the simple summary statistics to fully understand the
datum and to motivate the time-series approach used in the analysis. Table 1 presents
summary statistics for the datum. The results indicate that the average return is
negative but not statistically different from zero. Sentiment is quite volatile, with
large standard deviations and extreme values. The professional BSI ranges between
0.6 and -0.8 in our sample, and the individual, between 0.9598 and -0.6856.
Individual investors are too optimistic with a mean sentiment level notably over a
neutral value 0 (50-50), when compared with the zero-mean return. We conduct
stationary tests in order to avoid spurious regressions. According to ADF test three
series are all stationary. The last column of Table 1 displays the contemporaneous
correlation coefficient between returns and sentiment: 0.56（ significantly positive at
the 1% level with two-tailed t-test） for the professional and -0.05（ not
significantly） for the individual. But correlation is not equivalent to causality for the
reason that opinions collected may be affected by prices during the day, which may
produce the fictitious causality.

Some other measures are tested in the paper, such as the ratio of the proportion of bearish
investors to the whole investors. Results are omitted for parsimony since they are resemble.

3 Methodology and Results
3.1 Vector Autoregressions Model (VAR)
In order to see how sentiment and market returns interact and identify the (statistical)
causality between sentiment and the market, we use a set of VAR models,2 where
Granger causality tests and impulse response functions are developed from.
The general model is

3.1.1 Granger Causality Tests
The bivariate Granger causality tests examine whether the lags of one variable enter
the equation to determine the dependent variable, assuming that the two series ( BSI t
and R t ) are covariance stationary and error items ε t , η t i. i. d. white noise errors.3
A significant slope coefficient of equation (1) suggests that returns can predict
sentiment. In equation (2) a significant and positive slope coefficient shows that the
sentiment is a straight buying or selling indicator, while a negative coefficient implies
that the sentiment is a contrary indicator.
We estimate the models using both levels and changes（ Δ BSI t ） in sentiment
measures since it is not easy to determine which specification should reveal the
primary effects of sentiment. For example, suppose investor sentiment decreases from
very bullish to bullish. One might anticipate a positive return due to the still bullish
2

Hedgers who are concerned about fundamental information tend to hold positions for longer
horizons, whereas speculators likely adjust positions over shorter horizons in response to
short-term information. In the survey most of the individual are speculators, which make it
sound to test our hypothesis using VAR although with limit observations.
3
This assumption is tested using White [11] standard errors correct for heteroskedasticity. A
Lagrange multiplier test is used to verify that the residuals are serially uncorrelated. AIC, BIC
and Likelihood ratio tests are used to choose the best lag length. The appropriate test for the
parameter restrictions is a Wald Chi-squared test.

sentiment, but on the other hand, since sentiment has decreased it is also possible for
someone to expect a reduction in the return.
Table 2 reports the results from estimating the daily sample using VAR for both
professional and individual sentiment levels. The blocks of rows indicate the
contribution of each lagged independent variable. As the first block of rows shows
professional sentiment is strongly positively related to its past levels but less related to
returns ( significant only at the 5% level with a 3-day lag). The next column reveals
that professional sentiment strongly predict returns. Individual sentiment is strongly
positively related to its past levels and lagged returns according to the third column.
However, in the last column, there is no evidence that the individual sentiment will
predict returns.
These results confirm that both professional advisers and individual speculators are
strongly swayed by recent market performance. Lagged levels of sentiment and
market returns
explain substantial variation in professional sentiment as indicated by
2
the high R of 0.155, and individual sentiment by 0.749. Besides, individual
sentiment can not predict returns; but professional sentiment is a price-continuation
indicator, probably due to their rational expectation of fundamental messages. We
also find that individual sentiment is directed by professional sentiment (significant at
the 10% level), but not vice versa.
Table 3 estimates the system using the changes in sentiments, showing that a
change of either professional or individual sentiment is strongly related to its lagged
levels and returns. Conversely, there is weak evidence that changes in the2 sentiment
influence subsequent market returns, if any for the professional. The R for each
equation reveals that lagged sentiment changes and market returns explain roughly
30% of the professional sentiment and 8% of the individual sentiment, but less of the
variability in the returns. Moreover, changes of the two sentiments have no causal
relationship.

In summary, this section reveals that market returns are a strong predictor of
subsequent sentiment for both professional advisors and individual investors. In
contrast, there is no evidence that individual sentiment is useful in predicting future
returns over short horizons, whereas professional sentiment is a price indicator.

Remark. Sum impact indicates the aggregate sign of causality of all lags of an
explanatory variable, the null hypothesis that it equals zero is tested using a Chisquared test. Block exogenity reports the value of an F-test that the coefficients on all
lags of all independent variables (other than own-lags) are jointly zero. Variables are
changes of professional sentiment ( Δ BSIA) and individual sentiment ( Δ BSIB) and returns.
3.1.2 Impulse Response Function
An impulse response function investigates the response of one variable to one
standard deviation change of another variable by using the moving average
representation of the shocks for vector autoregression. Fig. 1 provides the results
revealing the time path of the dynamic interaction patterns between sentiment of the
professional and returns, where the figure of the individual is omitted. It can be found
that a shock in daily returns causes the greatest initial increase and then a steep
decline in professional sentiment, whereas the individual sentiment responds much
more slowly. Returns respond volatile to professional sentiment but insignificantly to
individual sentiment. Furthermore, sentiment is strongly affected by its own lagged
variable. On all accounts, the results are generally consistent with those obtained by
Granger causality tests.
3.2 Extreme Levels of Sentiment and Returns
While the causality test results presented above do not indicate a consistent
relationship between noise trader’s sentiment and subsequent price movements, it

may be possible that a relationship exists, but only at extreme levels of sentiment. The
hypothesis is tested by forming two groups based on sentiment: the extremely bullish
group (top 20%) and the extremely bearish group (bottom 20%). Results are shown in
Table 4. The slope coefficients are insignificant at the 10% level by t test, with the
exception of the individual bottom 20% sentiment since the equation is well fitted by t
and F tests. This suggests that individual bottom sentiment severs as a contrary
indicator of returns, and that other extreme sentiment levels could hardly predict
returns.

3.3 Robustness
We repeat the analysis using the data for 1-week, 2-week and 4-week intervals
(Monday-Monday) , because it is possible that people's perception of risk will be
changed over a longer interval than one day, and because it take some time for the

investing decisions to be carried out. Table 5 shows that professional sentiment and
changes is respectively related to lag returns for the 1-week and 2-week horizon, both
significant at the 10% level, however, individual sentiment is not affected by returns
for any of the tested horizon. Table 6 shows that future returns is negatively related to
changes of individual sentiment for the 1-week horizon (strongly significant at the 1%
level) and the latter explains 16% of the returns, whereas the coefficients in the other
circumstances are insignificant.

4 Summary and Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that survey-measuring investor sentiments are
related to market returns. We find little evidence of short-run (1-day interval)
predictability in returns for individual sentiment, but strong evidence for professional
sentiment. Neither professional nor individual extreme sentiment could predict
returns, with the exception of the individual bottom 20% sentiment. For 1-week, 2week and 4-week intervals, sentiment and changes is weakly related to lag returns,
which may be interpreted by the thing that individual investors make their decisions
on short time market information. Individual sentiment can explains 16% of the
returns a week later and it severs as a contrary indicator of returns, whereas the
coefficients in the other circumstances are insignificant. We also reveal that
professional sentiment is a predictor of individual sentiment, but not vice versa. Since
the datum used in our tests are short, the findings might be improved by including
more observations.

More work remains to be done in studying the determinants of investor sentiment
and the value of forecast based on sentiment of different types of traders (arbitragers
and speculators) in the futures markets. Some other sentiment measures may be
constructed to test the robustness of our conclusions.
