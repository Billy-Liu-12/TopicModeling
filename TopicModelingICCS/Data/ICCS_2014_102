Abstract
A robust simulation-driven methodology for rapid and reliable design of RF/microwave circuits
comprising compact microstrip resonant cells (CMRCs) is presented. We introduce a nested space
mapping (NSM) technology, in which the inner space mapping layer is utilized to improve the
generalization capabilities of the equivalent circuit model corresponding to a constitutive element of
the circuit under consideration. The outer layer enhances the surrogate model of the entire structure
under design. We demonstrate that NSM significantly improves performance of surrogate-based
optimization of composite RF/microwave structures. It is validated using two examples of UWB
microstrip matching transformers (MTs) and compared to other competitive surrogate-assisted
methods attempting to solve the problem of compact RF/microwave component design.
Keywords: EM-driven design, space mapping, compact RF components, design optimization

1 Introduction
The ability to rapidly and accurately design RF/microwave passives meeting the stringent
requirements of space-limited applications is an important challenge of modern wireless
communication engineering. Conventional RF/microwave components are simply too large for the use
in miniaturization-oriented applications (especially in the lower parts of the spectrum), yet necessary
for proper operation of wireless communication systems. To address this issue, numerous works, e.g.,
(Tsai 2013; Kurgan et al., 2012; Wincza and Gruszczynski, 2013; Chuang and Wu, 2004;
Smierzchalski et al. 2010; Kurgan and Kitlinski, 2010), proposed redesign of conventional

RF/microwave components by replacing their fundamental building blocks, i.e., uniform transmission
lines (UTLs), with composite structures of increased complexity. Geometrical parameters of these
structures have to be adjusted to yield a compact design with a satisfactory performance. Although
finding an abbreviated substitute for a UTL can be achieved by means of simplified transmission line
theory with negligible numerical effort (e.g., Kurgan and Kitlinski, 2009; Bekasiewicz and Kurgan,
2014), subsequent optimization of a highly-compressed and complex circuit layout has been
considered an extremely challenging problem. The main reason is the necessity of using accurate, but
CPU-intensive electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools for reliable evaluation of the component’s
performance, but also a large number of designable parameters that increase the complexity of the
optimization task. As opposed to conventional RF/microwave components, their miniaturized
counterparts are computationally much more expensive, which is another important factor hindering
the design process. For these reasons, classical EM-driven approaches of obtaining a final design,
based either on laborious parameter sweeps (usually one parameter at a time) guided by engineering
experience or a direct optimization, are found to be of limited use or even prohibitive when applied to
numerically demanding RF/microwave components with complex topologies that are described by
multiple designable parameters (Koziel et al., 2011; Koziel et al., 2013a; Koziel and Ogurstov, 2013).
The main drawback of a direct (e.g., gradient-based) EM optimization, which lies in a high
computational cost of the process, can be mitigated to some extent by using surrogate-based
optimization (SBO) techniques (Bandler et al., 2004; Koziel et al., 2013a; Koziel et al., 2013b) that
shift the computational burden from iterative evaluation of a numerically demanding EM model to a
computationally cheap low-fidelity surrogate exploited in an iterative prediction-correction loop. For
the past years, the SBO concept has proven its vital usefulness in a multitude of instances, e.g. (Cheng
et al., 2006; Koziel et al., 2006; Forrester and Keane, 2009; Koziel and Ogurstov, 2012), showcasing a
cost-efficient handling of complex optimization problems described by a relatively small number of
independent variables and supplied with well-suited physics-based analytical models of good
generalization capabilities available for conventional RF/microwave components. In case of compact
RF/microwave components with complex topologies, analytical coarse models are highly inaccurate
and their utilization causes convergence problems of the SBO process (Koziel et al., 2008).
In (Bekasiewicz et al., 2012), a method based on the design problem decomposition and a SBO
concept has been proposed to address the obstacle of a large number of designable parameters and a
high computational cost of the design, yielding satisfactory design solutions of RF/microwave
components with complex topologies at a relatively small cost. However, this technique requires an
inconvenient manual setup of multiple optimization problems, which circumvents the necessity of
handling a large number of parameters in a single optimization attempt.
In (Kurgan and Bekasiewicz, 2014), an extension to the method of (Bekasiewicz et al., 2012) has
been reported and validated using an extremely complex optimization problem with a few dozens of
designable parameters. By fixing a number of geometrical variables on the basis of theoretical
premises and low-cost preliminary studies of a low-fidelity model, a successful optimization was
performed. This approach enables to deal with a few dozens of optimization variables in a numerically
efficient manner, but is hindered by the same drawback as method (Bekasiewicz et al., 2012).
In this work, we propose a nested space mapping (NSM) approach for rapid design of compact
RF/microwave components based on compact microstrip resonant cells (CMRCs). NSM constructs a
two-stage surrogate model, with the inner SM layer applied at the level of the decomposed
components of the structure under consideration, and the outer SM layer applied for the entire circuit.
NSM addressed the problem of inaccurate surrogate models for compact RF/compact components by
ensuring their excellent generalization capabilities, which results not only in rapid design
improvement but also enables to solve the problem in a single optimization attempt. Our technique is
demonstrated using several UWB microstrip MTs and compared with two benchmark surrogate-based
optimization methods.

2 Nested Space Mapping Modeling
In this section, a nested space mapping (NSM) methodology is formulated. We also demonstrate
its importance for ensuring good generalization of SM-based surrogate models of CMRC structures, as
well as NSM advantages over conventional SM modeling.

2.1 Formulation of the Design Problem
Let Rf denote the response vector of a EM-simulated model of the CMRC structure of interest. We
will refer to it as fine or high-fidelity model. The design task is formulated as a nonlinear
minimization problem of the form

x* = arg min U ( R f ( x ))

(1)

x

Here, x is a vector of designable parameters, whereas U is an objective function implementing given
design specifications. Rf is assumed to be computationally expensive, which makes a direct
optimization of U(Rf(x)) prohibitive.

2.2 Surrogate-Based Optimization
To solve (1), we exploit surrogate-based optimization (SBO) that generates a sequence of
approximate solutions to (1), x(i), i = 0, 1, 2, … as follows (x(0) is an initial design) (Koziel et al.,
2012):

x (i +1) = arg min U ( Rs(i ) ( x ))

(2)

x

The surrogate model Rs(i) is a fast representation of the fine model Rf. In this work, Rs(i) is created
using a nested space mapping approach introduced in Section 2.3. The main rationale behind (2) is to
shift the optimization burden into the surrogate model so that most of the operation (in particular,
finding a new approximation of the optimum design x*) are performed on Rs(i) rather than on Rf. For a
well working SBO algorithm, the number of iterations of (2) necessary to find a satisfactory solution is
usually just a few. Also, the fine model is typically evaluated only once per iteration (Koziel et al.,
2012). The overall design optimization cost can be therefore dramatically reduced compared to
conventional optimization.

2.3 Nested Space Mapping Modeling
The nested space mapping (NSM) technique proposed here is a two-level modeling methodology,
with the first (inner) space mapping layer applied at the level of component, and the second (outer)
layer applied at the level of the entire structure. The purpose of NSM is to improve the generalization
capability of the surrogate model and facilitate the parameter extraction process. Consequently the cost
of the design optimization process using NSM can be greatly reduced compared to conventional space
mapping applied at the structure level only.
Figure 1 shows a typical CMRC component, its equivalent circuit representation, as well as a
CMRC-based structure, here, a matching transformer. Let Rf.cell(y) and Rc.cell(y) denote the responses
(here, S-parameters) of the fine (i.e., EM-simulated) and coarse (circuit-simulated) models of the
CMRC component. The vector y represents geometry parameters of the component. Rf(x) and Rc(x)
will stand for the fine and coarse models of the entire CMRC structure with x being a corresponding
vector of geometry parameters.

771

Nested Space Mapping Technology for Expedite EM-driven Design ...

Bekasiewicz et al.

The nested SM approach here builds up the surrogate model of the CMRC structure starting from
the component level. We use Rs.g.cell(y,p) to denote a generic component surrogate, which is a
composition of Rc.cell and suitable space mapping transformations; the vector p denotes the set of
extractable SM parameters of the model. The SM surrogate Rs.cell of a CMRC component is obtained
as
(3)

Rs.cell ( y) = Rs. g .cell ( y, p* )

The parameter vector p* is obtained by solving the following nonlinear parameter extraction process
N

p* = arg min ∑ k =cell1 || Rs. g .cell ( y ( k ) , p) − R f ( y ( k ) ) ||

(4)

p

The vectors y(k), k = 1, …, Ncell, denote the training (or base) designs. Here, we use the stardistributed base with Ncell = 2n + 1, where n is the number of designable parameters of the component
of interest. For practical design cases (cf. Section 3), the generic component surrogate exploits a
combination of input, implicit and frequency SM (Bandler et al., 2004). The surrogate model Rs.cell is
set up as a global model, i.e., it is supposed to be valid for the entire range of parameters y that will be
used in the subsequent CMRC structure design.
We will denote by Rs.g(x,P) a generic space mapping surrogate of the entire MT, composed of the
SM models of individual CMRC components, i.e., Rs.g(x,P) = Rs.g([y1; …; yp],P) = F(Rs.g.cell(y1,p*),…,
Rs.g.cell(yp,p*),P). For example, in case of matching transformers considered in Section 3, the function F
realizes cascade connection of S-parameters of individual components; the parameter vector x is a
concatenation of the component parameter vectors yk. The “global” SM parameter vector P is normally
defined as perturbations (with respect to p*) of selected SM parameters of individual components.
The outer SM level is applied to the global model Rs.g(x,P), so that the final surrogate Rs(i) utilized
in the ith iteration of the SBO scheme (2) is defined as follows
(5)

Rs(i ) ( x) = Rs.g ( x (i ) , P (i ) )

where
(6)

P (i ) = arg min || Rs.g ( x (i ) , P ) − R f ( x (i ) ) ||
P

It should be emphasized that in practice, the number of parameters in P is much smaller than the
combined number of SM parameters of CMRC components (i.e., multiple copies of a vector p*). This
is normally sufficient because the first SM layer already provides good alignment between the Rs.cell
and Rf.cell so that the role of (5), (6) is mainly to account for possible couplings between CMRC
components that are accounted for by the composing function F.

2.4 Generalization Capability of Nested Space Mapping. Optimization
Algorithm Convergence
Figure 2 demonstrates typical modeling accuracy of the inner space mapping layer of NSM,
illustrated here for a double-T CMRC-based component of Fig. 1(a). Globally accurate model at the
CMRC component level obtained by (3), (4), ensures good generalization capability of the final NSM
surrogate, which is the fundamental advantage of NSM. Figure 3 shows responses of the NSM
surrogate before and after parameter extraction (PE) (5). The surrogate (i.e., Rs.g) matches the fine
model well even before PE. Parameter extraction is executed using only a few parameters and allows
us to quickly compensate for the couplings between the CMRC components, which are not accounted
for by the component models themselves. At the same time, NSM model exhibits excellent
generalization as indicated in Fig. 3(b).
For the sake of comparison, conventional SM modeling of the entire transformer (i.e., correction of
its coarse model Rc) has been also performed. It is a much more complex process because (i) the
coarse model of the entire transformer is much less accurate than Rs.g (cf. Fig. 4(a)), (ii) a large
number of SM parameters is required, (iii) the parameter extraction process is more difficult and time
consuming, and (iv) generalization capability of the model is poor (cf. Fig. 4(b)).
Sufficient accuracy of the underlying coarse model and good generalization capability of the
surrogate are essential for fast convergence of the SBO optimization process (2) (Koziel et al., 2008).
The NSM model has both aforementioned features (here, the global model Rs.g is formally a coarse
model for (2)), which results in rapid design of CMRC-based structures as demonstrated in the next
section.

3 Case Study
In this section, we present verification results of the design optimization methodology of
Section 2. Verification has been performed using the double-T CMRC component and matching
transformers constructed using this component as a fundamental building block.

3.1 Surrogate Model Construction
The generic space mapping surrogate utilized in our numerical experiments takes the form of

Rs. g .cell ( y, p) = Rc.F ( B ⋅ x + c, pI )

(7)

where B and c are input SM parameters (here, we use diagonal matrix B), pI are implicit SM

parameters (here, substrate parameters for individual microstrip models, specifically, dielectric
permittivity and the substrate heights), as well as frequency scaling. Rc.F denotes frequency-scaled
coarse model. Given that Rc describes evaluation of the same equivalent circuit model (cf. Fig. 1(b))
across a frequency band of interest, i.e., Rc(y) = [Rc(y,ω1) Rc(y,ω2) … Rc(y,ωm)]T, the frequency-scaled
model is defined as

Rc.F ( y, p) = [ Rc ( y, f 0 + ω1 ⋅ f1 ) Rc ( y, f 0 + ω2 ⋅ f1 ) ... Rc ( y, f 0 + ωm ⋅ f1 )]T

(8)

where f0, f1 are extractable scaling parameters. Frequency scaling is very convenient to account for the
frequency-like misalignment between the coarse and the fine model (such as frequency shifts).

3.2 Matching Transformer Structure and Optimization Results
A double-T structure (cf. Fig. 1(a)) is described by 4 geometric parameters y = [l1 l2 w1 w2]T
(dimensions l3 = 0.2 and w3 = 0.2 are fixed). The high-fidelity models Rf.cell of the double-T structure
and its coarse model Rc.cell are implemented in CST MWS (CST, 2013) (RF-35 substrate with h = 0.76
mm) and Agilent ADS (ADS, 2011), respectively.
The first layer of the NSM model is created using 16 space mapping parameters, including eight
parameters of input SM, two frequency scaling parameters, and six implicit SM parameters. The
quality of the extracted CMRC component model has been illustrated in Fig. 2.
Consider a cascade of double-T CMRC components, Fig. 1(c), used for a construction of 3- and 4section MTs. The design objective is to achieve |S11| ≤ –15 dB in UWB band (3.1 to 10.6 GHz). The
vector of initial design parameters of each section is: y = [0.65 0.35 0.55 3.75]T.
A 3-section MT (i) is designed to match 50Ω÷100Ω impedance. The final design: x = [0.5 4.36
0.76 0.2 0.5 3.73 0.49 0.2 0.5 3.22 0.24 0.2]T is obtained after 2 iterations of the NSM technique (|S11|
≤ –17.5 dB for 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz).
A cascade of 4 cells, constitutes a 50Ω÷130Ω MT (ii). The final MT design denoted by: x = [1.0
3.52 0.85 0.2 0.8 4.10 0.58 0.05 0.8 3.09 0.1 0.25 1 2.315 0.13 0.05]T is obtained after only 3
iterations of the proposed algorithm (|S11| ≤ –16.5 dB for 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz).
One should emphasize that for both MTs, the number of the outer layer SM parameters P is much
smaller than the combined set of SM parameters for the inner layer (11 vs. 48 for the first MT and 14
vs. 64 for the second one) as only frequency scaling and selected implicit SM parameters are used.
Reduction of the number of parameters (possible because of excellent generalization capability of
NSM) considerably speeds up the design process. The reflection characteristics of (i) and (ii) MTs are
shown in Fig. 5.

3.3

Comparisons

The computational efficiency of NSM was compared with implicit space-mapping (Bandler et al.,
2004) and sequential space-mapping (Bekasiewicz et al., 2012) that were previously used for CMRCbased structure design. The proposed technique results in the smallest number of iterations necessary
to yield an optimized geometry (see Table 1) for all considered cases. Additionally, a comparison with
direct optimization of the EM transformer model is included, here, using pattern search (Kolda et al.,
2003) to show that the latter method is virtually impractical for the design of compact MTs.

4 Conclusions
A nested SM (NSM) optimization technique has been presented. In our approach, a two-layer
space mapping model is constructed, with the inner layer applied at the component level, and the outer
layer applied at the level of the entire structure under design. The fundamental advantage of the
proposed technique is the generalization capability of the NSM surrogate is significantly better than
that of the conventional (single-layer) space mapping model, which leads to a decreased overall design
cost, a reduced number of extractable surrogate model parameters, and improving the robustness of the
optimization process. NSM is validated using two test cases. In both cases, the average optimization
cost is three iterations or less. This is a significant speedup compared to competitive surrogate-based
methods, leaving alone direct optimization of the EM-simulation model.
