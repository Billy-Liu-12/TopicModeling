Abstract. Based on interactive fuzzy goal programming, a model is introduced
for extended hub-and-spoke regional port transportation network optimization
problem where one of the objective functions is considered as a non-linear function. The proposed model considers the imprecise nature of the input data and
assumes that each objective function has a fuzzy goal, and aims at jointly minimizing the total costs including the sailing cost and handling cost as well as the total transit times consisting of sailing time and handling time. Meanwhile it optimizes the following factors: transportation quantities via a hub port from an original port to a destination port, transportation quantities directly from an original
port to a destination port. The solution procedure to the proposed model is then
presented. At last, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed model and evaluate the performance of the solution procedure.
Keywords: Fuzzy goal programming, Hub-and-spoke, Optimization, Port

1 Introduction
In regional port transportation networks, the sizes and types of ships calling at every
port are different because individual port’s natural condition and capacity are different. The route selection is important in regional port transportation network optimization. The port condition and economy of scale in ship transportation should be
considered to select the routes from original ports to destination ports. The ports are
connected by direct transports or via a transshipment port. This has led to the formation of hub-and-spoke networks in regional port transportation industry. Cargoes from
original ports are usually consolidated at hub port and shipped to different destination
ports. Hub-and-spoke transportation can be classified into two types: pure and extended [1]. The pure hub-and-spoke transportation network is characterized by transshipment in which direct transport between ports is excluded and all cargoes have to
be transported via a hub port. The extended hub-and–spoke transportation network
consists of direct transportation between ports and transshipment via the hub port.

In this paper, based on extended hub-and-spoke port transportation system, a decision model is developed to determine the following factors: shipment volume via a
hub port from an original port to a destination port, shipment volume directly from an
original port to a destination port.
The decision problem of hub-and-spoke systems has received many attentions in
academic literature. Some researchers solved it as the location –allocation problem
that determines locations of hubs and assigns shipments to each route[2][3][4]. Another researchers examined it as the pure allocation problem that finds the optimal
assignment of shipments under predetermined hub locations[5][6][7]. But the models
and methods in these studies are applied in air or truck transportation networks and
have been less focused on linking hub-and-spoke system to ports. Most of them only
consider transportation (or travel) cost and don’t include the handling costs occurring
at nodes. Furthermore, these studies only consider one objective function. This paper
introduces a model to examine the pure allocation problem in extended hub-andspoke regional port transportation network. The model aims at jointly minimizing the
total costs consisting of sailing cost and handling cost occurring at the ports as well as
total time consisting of sailing time and handling time occurring at the ports, in which
the time objective function is a non-linear function. In addition, the existing decision
problem of hub-and-spoke system is a deterministic mathematical programming problem. However, in practice, the input data or decision parameters, such as transportation capacity, cost, time and objective function are often imprecise because some
information is uncertain. Therefore, the values of these parameters are rarely constant.
To deal with ambiguous parameters in the above decision problem, this paper uses an
interactive fuzzy goal programming model to formulate the problem of extended huband-spoke regional port transportation network optimization, and propose a solution
procedure for this model.

In real world, the input data or parameters of (P1) problem, such as transportation
capacity and objective function are often imprecise because some information is unobtainable. Conventional mathematical programming can’t capture such vagueness in
the critical information. In this case, a fuzzy programming approach is commonly
used to treat the information in a fuzzy environment. However, some researchers have
presented the shortcomings of using fuzzy programming in solving some multiobjective decision problems. Abd El-Wahed (2001) proved that using fuzzy
programming in solving such multi-objective transportation problem changes the
standard form of the transportation problem [8]. In addition, Li and Lai (2000) proved
that using the min-operator does not guarantee an efficient solution[9]. In this paper,
we introduce an interactive fuzzy goal programming model for regional port transportation networks optimization, which is the combination of interactive programming,
fuzzy programming and goal programming, and leverages the advantages of the three
approaches as well as reduces some or all of the shortcomings of each individual
approach [10].

3 Interactive Fuzzy Goal Programming Approach
3.1 IFGP Model
In our model, we capture the ambiguity about the fuzzy information related to the
total transportation cost, total transportation time and transportation capacities by
transforming the (P1) model into the following (P2) model.

In this paper, a linear membership function defined in Bellman and Zadeh(1970)
has been considered for all fuzzy parameters in (P2) problem.
To formulate model (P2) as a goal programming model, we introducing the following positive and negative deviation variables:

k = 1, 2

where

Gi is the aspiration level of the objective function i .

By using the given membership functions and introducing an auxiliary variable L
the fuzzy programming model (P2) can be formulated as the following equivalent
programming model (P3) (Zimmermann, 1978):

as well as constraints given in (3), (4) and (6).
3.2 The Solution Procedure
In order to obtain the solution to Model (P3), the following procedure can be applied.
Step1: Solve the model (P1) as a single objective problem to obtain the initial
solutions for each objective function, i.e.

X 1 = {xij1 } and X 2 = {xij2 } ,

i = 0,1,..M , j = 0,1,..., M , . i ≠ j . If X 1 = X 2 , select one of them as an optimal
solution and go to Step 6. Otherwise, go to Step 2.

min

Step 2: Determine the best lower bound ( Z k
for each objective function: Z1 =Z1(X ),
min

) and the worst upper bound ( Z kmax )

Z1max = Z1( X 2 ) , Z2min = Z2(X2) , Z2max = Z2(X1) ,

i = 0,1,..M , j = 0,1,..., M , i ≠ j .
Step 3: Define the membership functions of each objective function.
Step 4: Solve problem (P4) as a goal programming and obtain the solution to it.
Compare the upper bound of each objective function with the new value of the objective function. If the new value of each objective function is equal to the upper bound,
go to Step 6. Otherwise, go to Step 5.
Step 5: Update the upper bound of each objective function. If the new value of the
objective function is lower than the upper bound, consider this as a new upper bound.
Otherwise, keep the old one as is. Go to Step 3.
Step 6: Stop.

4 Numerical Example
We consider the following numerical example to demonstrate the application of
IFGP. Assume that there are four ports and one hub in regional port transportation
network. There are two types of ships employed in the route between two ports. The
transportation capacity of ship for type 1 is 5000 Ton, whereas that for type 2 is 8000
ton. The handling cost per ton occurring at Port 1, Port 2, Port 3, Port 4 and Port 0 are
0.40,0.55,0.60,0.65 and 0.40 Yuan, respectively. The handling time per ton occurring
at Port 1, Port 2, Port 3, Port 4 and Port 0 are 0.5,1.0,1.0,1.5 and 0.5 hour, respectively. The other data of the problem is given in Table1, Table2 and Table3.

hub-and-spoke regional port transportation network optimization problem, where
transportation capacity and objective function are considered as o imprecise/fuzzy,
and aims at jointly minimizing the total costs including the sailing cost between ports
and handling cost occurring at all ports as well as the total transit times consisting of
sailing time between ports and handling time in all ports. To obtain the solution of the
above-mentioned problem, the solution procedure for the model is illustrated by updating both the membership values and the aspiration levels. At last, a numerical
