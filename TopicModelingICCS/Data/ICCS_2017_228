1. Introduction
Today the capital market situation is complex. Different capital operations will have different effects
on enterprises’ performance. By studying this kind of problems, we can understand the law of financial
market better, strengthen the regulation of listed companies' behaviors. More important, we can provide
experiences for listed companies to help them choose suitable financial strategies. From the investment
point, it is helpful to identify favorable investment opportunities, and create profits.
Many scholars have studied capital operations of enterprises and the influences of these operations.
In the study of corporate investment strategy, Chen Shihua et al (2013) study the connection between
the directors and target companies from the perspective of information asymmetry between the two
sides. It is found that the connection has no significant effect on short-term performance, but a positive
impact on long-term performance. Yu Pengyi and Wang Mansi (2014) study the impact of cross-border
mergers and acquisitions of listed companies. They build a comprehensive system by selecting multiple
financial indicators and find that cash payments and the acquisition of the company's largest shareholder
shareholding ratio have positive impact on business performance; while other factors have different
effects according to short or long periods.
From the financial point of view, K. H. Wruck, Y. L. Wu (2009) think that when the private
placement led to increased control and improve the governance structure: it will increase the company’s
value. Xu Shoufu et al (2011) hold the view that private placement will lead to a declining long-term
performance. In recent years, behavioral finance theory based on heterogeneous beliefs has become an
important research frontier in international academic circles. Deng Lu and Wang Huacheng (2014)
examine the relationship between private placement and long-term stock market performance from
heterogeneous beliefs. The results show that the greater the heterogeneity of investors is, the worse the
long-term market performance of listed companies is after the private placement.
For equity incentives, Aboody et al. (2010) conducted a sample study of 1364 companies that
implemented equity incentives in 1990-1996 and whose stock price fell more than 30 percent from the
previous year. Their findings suggest employee stock options provide sufficiently incentive effects to
the firms’ performance. Sun Jian and Lu Chuang (2012) study the influence of executive power of equity
incentive and the response of the market. It was found that the market would respond positively to equity
incentive plan of most companies. But the negative correlation between the intensity of stock option
incentive and the market reaction shows that investors may think that the high grant ratio is caused by
the self-interest behavior of executives.
From the research above, it can be noted that the current academic researches mostly start from the
theoretical point of view and research content is constructed based on one specific problem. We plan to
explore the financial strategy model from the capital operations of listed companies with market value
management. It is beneficial to establish market or industry benchmarks and guide the target companies
to better operate their capitals.

2. Random Forest
Random Forest was first proposed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. It is made up of multiple
CARTs (Classification and Regression Tree). The randomness is mainly reflected in two aspects: (1)
when training each tree, the data sample are stochastically chosen from all training sample, i.e. bootstrap
sampling; (2) At each node, a subset of all features is selected at random and used to calculate the
optimal partitioning.
Random Forest mainly consists of following four steps:
1.

Random selection of samples
Given a training sample set (the number of samples is N), we use a put-back method to constitute
training sets. Then we take the sample sets as training sets, enter the following step.

2.

Random selection of features
We can calculate Gini impurity of the features we stochastically selected from the training sets to
choose the optimal ones. To compute Gini impurity for a set of items with 𝐽𝐽 classes, suppose 𝑖𝑖 ∈
{1,2, … , 𝐽𝐽}, and let 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 be the fraction of items labeled with class 𝑖𝑖 in the set, then we have
𝐽𝐽

3.

Build the decision tree

𝐼𝐼𝐺𝐺 (𝑓𝑓) = ∑ 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 (1 − 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 ) = ∑ 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘
𝑖𝑖=1

𝑖𝑖≠𝑘𝑘

With the sample sets, we can construct a classification decision tree.
4.

Random Forest voting classification
Repeating the above steps H times, we get the H decision tree. For each test sample, we use every
decision tree to classify it so H classification results can be obtained. Then a simple voting
mechanism is applied to gain the final classification of the test sample results.
Compared with other classification algorithms, random forest has many advantages. It can handle

high-dimensional data, and there is no need to do the feature selection. The over-fitting can be avoided
to some extent because each training decision tree is randomly selected to use different training sets.
After training, the importance of features is given, and it offers a great reference value.

3. Data and Methodology
3.1 Indicator system construction
Market Value Management evaluates the performance of listed companies from three aspects: value
creation, value realization and the correlation between the two. This paper constructs the market value

1273

1274	

management evaluation system and ranks all the A-share listed companies in China from 2007 to 2015
according to scores of the system we built based on the "China listed company market value
management performance evaluation report". The higher the score is, the higher the ranking is, which
indicates that listed companies have better performance in both value creation and value realization.
The system of market value management is a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of listed
companies from both value creation and value realization. But are the results reliable for listed
companies? To this end, we explore the effectiveness of market value management on value investment
of listed company from both the whole market and private enterprises (including foreign-capital
enterprises).
From the perspective of the whole market, we select the top 300, bottom 300 and randomly selected
300 of the listed company in each year according to our annual ranking of listed companies and invest
in these three portfolios with equal weight year by year. Then we calculate the cumulative return for the
9 years. The results are shown in Figure 1. We can see the cumulative return of the top 300 listed
companies is significantly higher than that of the other two sets of stocks. Meanwhile the cumulative
return of the bottom 300 is significantly lower than the other two sets. Therefore, market value
management is effective for investment.
As the ownership structure of private enterprises is different from that of state-owned enterprises,
and in order to further explore the significance of market value management in value investing, we
further choose the private enterprises (including foreign-capital enterprises) as separate samples. Using
the same method to calculate the cumulative return, and selecting the top 10%, bottom 10% and
stochastically selected 10% from these enterprises, we can obtain the comparison of the cumulative
return of private enterprises (including foreign-capital enterprises) and of the whole market, which is
shown in Figure 2. For the private enterprises (including foreign-capital enterprises), the cumulative
return of the top 10% of on listed companies is higher than that of the other two sets. Also, the cumulative
return of the bottom 10% is lower than the other two sets. Therefore, the market value management is
also effective from the perspective of the private enterprises (including foreign-capital enterprises).

and random selected 10% of the private enterprises
(including foreign-capital enterprises)

3.2 The selection of capital operation
Based on the basic situation of China's capital market and the disclosure of major events in annual
reports of the listed companies, we selected five types of capital operation including private placement,
mergers and acquisitions, reduction of shareholdings, increasing of shareholdings, equity incentives.

3.3 Data preprocessing
Considering the different IPO timing, we construct the time series of capital operation of listed
companies based on frequency statistics. We also divide the duration into the bull market and the bear
market, which combine with China's financial market trend. The bull market period is 2007.1-2008.2
while the bear market time is 2009.8-2014.6.

4. Results and Analysis
In this paper, we use the Random Forest algorithm to study on the relationship between capital
operation mode and performance of Chinese listed companies, and compare them with other machine
learning algorithms, including KNN, SVM, PCA-SVM, Logistic Regression, PCA Logistic Regression
and Adaboost. 5-fold cross validation is used to explore the effect of different capital operation modes
on the market value management of listed companies.
Combined the above classification methods with the market value management score of listed
companies, we try to classify the listed companies. In the classification process, we set up two different
cases. The first is to apply the classification on all the listed companies of the A-share market while the
second is to apply the classification only on the private enterprises (including foreign-capital enterprises).
Meanwhile, different thresholds are set to test the stability of each algorithm.
Table 1 is the statistics of classification accuracy of bull market and bear market under different
thresholds. It can be seen from Table 1 that the classification accuracy obtained by using RF
classification is more than 60%, and when the threshold is set to 10% (corresponding to σ = 0.1), the
accuracy of classification under different circumstances has reached more than 70%, which shows that
the capital operation has significant correlation with the market value management of the listed
companies. This can further illustrate that different capital operations may have different impact on the
market value management of the listed company. In addition, the classification accuracy is significantly

1276	

higher when we distinct between the bull market and the bear market than when we don’t. So, different
capital operations will have different effects under different circumstances.
The classification accuracy of different algorithms also varies when we compare the private
enterprises and the whole market. As Table 1 shows, Random Forest wins with the highest precision
under different thresholds, while in the case of no distinguish between bull market and bear market
(Table 2), the classification accuracy of Random Forest algorithm is the highest except for when σ = 0.2
AdaBoost classification accuracy is the highest.

In addition, the classification accuracy of the private enterprises (including foreign enterprises) and
the whole market enterprises in the case of σ = 0.1 is shown in Figure 3. As can be seen in Figure 3, the
classification accuracy of RF in all cases reaches the highest. No matter it is private enterprises or not,
we can see the classification results are significantly better when the bull market and bear market
information is added into the input variables.

The classification accuracy of various algorithms by adding the information of bull market and bear
market into the private enterprises (including foreign-capital enterprises) is shown in Figure 4. Random
Forest always reaches the highest classification and shows the best stability with the different threshold.
Another advantage of Random Forest is the importance of each input variable can be obtained.
Figure 5 is the importance indicators derived from Random Forest of various types of capital operation
in the bull market and bear market. Reduction of shareholdings is the most important in both the bull
market and the bear market, indicating that companies should be prudent to implement reduction of
shareholdings. Besides, the capital operations have greater impact on market value management in the
bear market than in the bull market. The importance indicators of the other capital operations are higher
in the bear market except private placement. Comparing the change of market value management
ranking before and after the different capital operations of bull market bear market, we also find that
firms with great rise of market value management rank have less shareholder reduction behavior, and
they also apply less mergers and acquisitions in bear market than the firms with declining market value
management ranks.

Further, combined with the actual market situation, intensive reduction of executives and major
shareholders will have some negative impact on the whole market, such as in May 2015, the stock price
turned down in the face of executives’ and major shareholders’ intensive reduction. On the other hand,
the company's financial statement of after one year of the reduction decreased significantly, such as the
growth rate of earnings per share, current ratio, total assets. Therefore, the reduction of shareholders of
listed companies often have a negative impact on market value management. The phenomenon that
M&A is used less in the bear market reflects, to a certain extent, it is not conducive the bear market. The
scale of listed companies refinance is often large. A large number of equity financing also need a better
market environment, while enthusiasm of capital participation is not high in the bear market. For
mergers and acquisitions, the wave of mergers and acquisitions in the history of the United States often
closely coincides with the bull market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose to 91%, 383%, 400%,
217% and 317% in the five mergers and acquisitions waves. Therefore, the application of mergers and
acquisitions may be more suitable for the bull market.

5. Conclusion
The relationship between the capital operation and the market value management is one of the most
concerned issues of listed companies. In the past, academic research concerned more on the study of
one of the certain capital operation modes such as M & A and equity incentive. Conclusions tend to be
single. This paper explores the relationship between all kinds of capital operations and market value

management of Chinese listed companies using random forest algorithm and compares them with other
machine learning algorithms. It can be seen from the experiment that there is a significant relationship
between capital operation and market value management of listed companies, and different capital
operation modes have different effects on market value management under different market conditions.
Compared with other machine learning algorithms, Random Forest algorithm has the highest
classification accuracy in different market environments, and the classification result is better when the
bull market and bear market information is added into the input. At the same time, the Random Forest
algorithm is more stable than the other algorithms under different threshold. From the importance
indicator that we get from the Random Forest algorithm, the importance of shareholder reduction is
higher than the other capital operations under both the bull market and the bear market. And the capital
operation mode has a greater impact on the market value management under the bear market. Finally,
by comparing the change of market capitalization before and after the different capital operation of bull
market and bear market, we find that the firms with large rise of market value rank have less shareholder
reduction behavior, and apply less mergers and acquisitions in bear market. To some extent, this may
explain the reduction of shareholders have a negative impact on market value management and the
mergers and acquisitions may be more suitable for bull market.
