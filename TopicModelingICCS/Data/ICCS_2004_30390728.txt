Abstract. Many classes of functional RNA molecules are characterized
by highly conserved secondary structures but little detectable sequence
similarity. Reliable multiple alignments can therefore be constructed only
when the shared structural features are taken into account. Sankoﬀ’s
algorithm can be used to construct such structure-based alignments of
RNA sequences in polynomial time. Here we extend the approach to a
probabilistic one by explicitly computing the partition function of all
pairwise aligned sequences with a common set of base pairs. Stochastic
backtracking can then be used to compute e.g. the probability that a
prescribed sequence-structure pattern is conserved between two RNA
sequences. The reliability of the alignment itself can be assessed in terms
of the probabilities of each possible match.

Introduction

Sankoﬀ’s algorithm [1] simultaneously predicts a consensus structure for two
(or, in its general version, more) RNA secondary structures and at the same
time constructs their alignment. It is quite expensive in both CPU and memory
requirements, O(N 6 ) and O(N 4 ), respectively. A further complication is that
it requires the implementation of the full loop-based RNA energy model [2].
Currently available software packages such as foldalign [3] and dynalign [4]
therefore implement only restricted versions. A complementary approach is taken in the pmmatch program [5]. Instead of attempting to solve the alignment
and the structure prediction problem simultaneously, pmmatch utilizes the base
pairing probability matrices predicted by means of McCaskill’s algorithm [6]
(implemented in the RNAfold program of Vienna RNA Package [7,8]). The problem then becomes the alignment of the base pairing probability matrices. This
appears to be an even harder threading problem, which in general is known to
be NP-complete [9]. In the RNA case, the threading problem remains tractable
as long as we score the alignment based on the notion of a common secondary
structure. In fact, it reduces to a variant of the Sankoﬀ algorithm in which the

energy model for structure prediction part is reduced to base weights on the base
pairs.
Suppose we are given two sequences A and B (of length n = |A| and m = |B|)
together with their pair probability matrices P A and P B , resp. A natural way of
determining the similarities of P A and P B is to search for the secondary structure
of maximal “weight” that P A and P B have in common. Let Si,j;k,l be the score of
M
the best matching of the subsequences A[i..j] and B[k..l]. Furthermore, let Si,j;k,l
be the best match subject to the constraint that (i, j) and (k, l) are matched
base pairs. With this deﬁnition one obtains dynamic programming recursions

with the initialization Si,j;k,l = |(j − i) − (l − k)|γ for j − i ≤ M + 1 or
l − k ≤ M + 1, where M is the minimum size of a hairpin loop, usually
M = 3. The constant γ < 0 is a gap penalty. The scores αik = α(Ai , Bk ) and
τij,kl = τ (PijA , Ai , Aj ; PijB , Bk , Bl ) describe the substitution of unpaired bases
and base pairs, respectively. The latter term may depend on both the structures and the underlying sequences. Backtracking can be used to retrieve both
the common secondary structure and the associated sequence alignment [5]. For
both RNA folding and sequence alignment it is possible to compute partitions functions instead of optimal scores with essentially the same resources. In
a second step probabilistic versions of the optimal structure of alignment can
be constructed; see [6] for RNA folding and [10,11,12,13,14]. In this contribution we describe a “partition function version” of the Sankoﬀ algorithm that
computes the probabilities of matches in the structure-based alignments of two
RNA molecules, thereby providing an intrinsic measure of the local quality of the
structure-based alignments. In the thermodynamic interpretation of the simultaneous folding and alignment problem a state θ is a pair θ = (S, A) of secondary
structure S consisting of all matched base pairs (ij; kl), where (Ai , Aj ) is a base
pair in structure A and (Bk , Bl ) is a base pair in structure B, and an alignment
A of the underlying sequences A and B such that Ai Bk and Aj Bl are matches.
Note that the alignment A in general contains further matches corresponding to
unpaired nucleotides. The probability of a particular state is then
Prob[θ] = Z −1 exp(−σ(θ))

is the partition function of the model. The probability of a feature Ω can now
be computed as the sum of the probabilities of all states θ ∈ Ω. In particular,
we are interested in Ω (p,q) , the set of all states in which Ap Bq is a match in the
alignment.

Recursions

We ﬁrst observe that equ.(1) can easily be transformed into a recursion for the
partition function Zij;kl of the model restricted to the subsequences A[i..j] and
B[k..l]. Explicitly, we obtain
Zij;kl = Zi+1,j;kl eγ + Zij;k+1,l eγ + Zi+1,j;k+1,l eαik
Zi+1,p−1;k+1,q−1 Zp+1,j;q+1,l eτij,pq

+

(k,q) paired in B
(i,p) paired in A

Let us now consider all states that contain the match Ax By . We have to distinguish four cases: (i) there is no matched base pair in S, (ii) (i, x; j, y) ∈ S,
(iii) (x, k; y, l) ∈ S, and (iv) Ax By is “immediately interior” to a matched pair
(i, j; k, l) ∈ S in the sense that i < x < j, k < y < l and there no other pair
(i , j , k , l ) ∈ S such that i < i < x < j < j and k < k < y < l < l. Fig. 1
gives a graphical description: Clearly, these four cases are pairwise disjoint and
cover all possibilities. We can therefore write the partition function Qxy of all
states that contain the match Ax By in the alignment as follows:
Qxy =Z1,x−1;1,y−1 eαij Zx+1,n;y+1,n +
Zi+1,x−1;k+1,y−1 eτi,x;k,y Zi,x;k,y +

where Zi,j;k,l denotes the partition function over all partial states outside the
aligned interval [i, j][k, l], i.e., excluding the positions i, j, k, and l. This corresponds to the states of the sub-problem with A = A[1..i − 1]A[j + 1..n] and
B = B[1..k − 1]B[l + 1, m]. We can easily ﬁnd recursions for computing Zi,j;k,l
from shorter subproblems (i.e., those with a larger “missing” interval) and the
values of Zi,j;k,l :
Zi,j;k,l =Zi,j+1;k,l eγ + Zi,j;k,l+1 eγ + Zi,j+1;k,l+1 eαj+1,l+1 +

The probability for the match Ax By given the input data and scoring scheme is
simply
P xy = Qxy /Z

(8)

Tabulating the O(n4 ) entries of the partition functions Zij;kl requires O(n6 )
operation, just as the solution of the optimization problem. Then Zij;kl can
be computed also in O(n6 ) operations. Given these two tables, recursion 6 can
be evaluated in O(n4 ) steps for each value x and y. The matrix of matching
probabilities can therefore be computed in O(n4 ) memory and O(n6 ) CPU. Just
as in the case of sequence alignments and secondary prediction, the partition
function version is therefore not more expensive than the associated optimization
problem.

3

Stochastic Backtracking

As described in [5], backtracking in the recursions (1) can be performed in O(n3 )
to obtain a score-optimal alignment. When the partition functions Zi,j;k,l for
the sub-problems are known, it is possible sample from the distribution of the
alignments by means of “stochastic backtracking”. This approach has recently
been implemented for pairwise sequence alignment [14] and for RNA structure
prediction in the latest release of the Vienna RNA Package [8,16], see also [17,
18], and [19], where the idea was used to generate random RNA structures with
uniform distribution. This method generalizes in a straightforward way to the
Sankoﬀ algorithm: From equ.(5) we obtain immediately that the sub-alignment
of x[i..j] with y[k..l] can be of one of the four types listed below with their
corresponding probabilities p:
Deletion of xi
p = Zi+1,j;kl eγ /Zij;kl
Deletion of yk
p = Zij;k+1,l eγ /Zij;kl
Unpaired Match of xi and yj
p = Zi+1,j;k+1,l eαik /Zij;kl
Matched pair (xi , xp ), (yk − yq ) p = Zi+1,p−1;k+1,q−1 Zp+1,j;q+1,l eτij,pq /Zij;kl
Choosing in each step of the backtracking procedure one of these alternatives with the correct probability results again in an algorithm that produces an

Fig. 3. Match probabilities for the pairwise alignments of the two tRNAs DA0980 and
DF1140 from Fig. 2. The area of the squares at position x, y is proportional to P xy . The
small panels along the axes show the position-wise entropies relative to each sequence

alignment in O(n3 ) steps, such that the probability of an alignment with score
σ is p = exp(−σ), Fig. 2. The advantage of this procedure is that an ensemble
of on the order of n3 sample alignments can be computed economically (since
we need O(n6 ) time for the forward recursion and only O(n3 ) for backtracking
a single alignment). These samples can then be used to estimate the probabilities of features such as particular multiloops or non-local sequence-structure
combinations.

An Example

As an example we consider here the alignment of two rather disparate tRNA
sequences, Figs. 2 and 3. We use here
B
B
τ (PijA , Ai , Aj ; Pkl
, Bk , Bl ) = 2 ln n + ln PijA + ln Pkl

(9)

for the pair score and neglect sequence similarity altogether, i.e., αik = 0. Note
that for both sequences the predicted optimal secondary structures is not the
clover-leaf, as shown in the l.h.s. of Fig. 2. Nevertheless, most stochastic backtrackings retrieve the clover-leaf as consensus structure of the two molecules.
Since sequence similarity was not used in the scoring, the exact position of gaps
within loop regions is arbitrary. For low temperatures (upper right panel in
Fig. 2) alignments diﬀer almost exclusively in the D-loop and at the 3’ end of
the tRNAs. The local reliability of the alignment can be measured by the entropy
of the match probabilities
P xy ln P xy − p0 (x) ln p0 (x)

S(x) = −
y

(10)

734

I.L. Hofacker and P.F. Stadler

where p0 (x) = 1 − y P xy is the probability the position x is unmatched (i.e.,
opposite to a gap in the alignment). As can be seen in Fig.3, the alignment
is typically much more well-deﬁned in paired regions. For large values of the
temperature T this diﬀerence disappears, however.

Concluding Remarks

We have introduced here a partition function version of the Sankoﬀ algorithm.
The algorithm is quite expensive both in memory and CPU time; the resource
requirement is, however, essentially the same as for the “classical” version that
computes the optimal alignment only. From the partition functions we can, in addition to the optimal alignment, also discriminate reliable from unreliable parts
of a structure-based alignment of RNA molecules. Stochastic pairwise alignments
are useful in many diﬀerent contexts: Numerous tools in bioinformatics require
pairwise sequence alignments as input data. The present approach thus provides
a tool that can be used to produce alignments with realistically distributed errors
and varying overall quality (by choosing the temperature parameter T ). These
can be used to investigate the sensitivity of the method with respect to realistic
variations of the input alignments. In particular, used as an input of a multiple
alignment methods such as t-coffee [20] it can be used to produce multiple
alignments together with estimates of local alignment quality. While the Sankoﬀ
algorithm is too slow to scan large portions of a genome for conserved RNAs, it
is still useful to post-process candidates for structurally conserved RNA detected by other methods, e.g. qrna [21]. The current implementation uses simple
linear gap costs. A generalization to aﬃne gap costs is straightforward along the
lines of Gotoh’s algorithm [22] for sequence alignments and should improve the
placement of scattered gaps.
