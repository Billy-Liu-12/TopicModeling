Abstract. Operational risk has become increasingly important topics
for Chinese Commercial Banks in recent years. Considering the huge operational losses, Extreme value theory (EVT) has been recognized as a
useful tool in analyzing such data. In this paper, we presented an ERMPOT (Exponential Regression Model and the Peaks-Over-Threshold)
method to measure the operational risk. The ERM-POT method can
lead to bias-corrected estimators and techniques for optimal threshold
selections. And the experiment results show that the method is reasonable.
Keywords: operational risk; EVT; POT; ERM; VaR.

Introduction

Basel II for banking mandates a focus on operational risk. In the Basel framework, operational risk is deﬁned as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The operational risk is one of the most important risks for Chinese commercial banks,
and brings huge losses to Chinese commercial banks in recent years. Considering
the size of these events and their unsettling impact on the ﬁnancial community
as well as the growing likelihood of operational risk losses, it is very important
for analysis, modelling and prediction of rare but dangerous extreme events.
Quantitative approaches should be achieved.
EVT has developed very rapidly over the past two decades. Also it has been
recognized as a useful set of probabilistic and statistical tools for the modelling
of rare events and its impact on insurance, ﬁnance and quantitative risk management is well recognized [2]. The distribution of operational risk is heavy-tailed

and high-kurtosis. Considering the nature of the operational risk and their unsettling impact, EVT can play a major role in analyzing such data. A fast growing
literature exists. For details, see references [1],[2],[3],[4] . . .
In this paper, we presented an ERM-POT method to measure the operational
risk. In POT method, how to choose the threshold in an optimal way is a delicate
matter. A balance between bias and variance has to be made. In general, Hillplot and mean excess function (MEF) can be used to choose the threshold.
However, selection of the threshold by the two approaches may produce biased
estimates because the two are empirical. The ERM-POT method can lead to
bias-corrected estimators and techniques for optimal threshold selections. With
ERM-POT, the optimal threshold is selected, and then VaR is obtained.
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we give a brief view of the
ERM-POT method. Section 3 is the experiment with the ERM-POT. The last
part concludes the paper.

The ERM-POT Method

Given a threshold u and a heavy-tailed sample X1 , ......, Xn , denote Nu be the
number of exceeding observations Xi1 , ......XiNu and denote the excesses Yj =
Xij − u ≥ 0. The distribution of excess values of X over threshold u is deﬁned
by
F (x + u) − F (u)
Fu (x) := P (X − u ≤ x|X > u) =
,
(1)
1 − F (u)
For a suﬃciently high threshold u, Fu (x) can be approximated by the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) [7]:
Gγ,σ (x) =

−1/γ
,γ=0
1 − (1 + γx
σ )
,
1 − exp(−x/σ), γ = 0

where Gγ,u,σ (x) := Gγ,σ (x − u) with the shape parameter γ and the scale parameter σ. Fit a GPD to the excesses Y1 , ......, YNu to obtain estimates γˆ and σ

with Maximum Likelihood (ML). For x > u, from equation(1) and equation (2),
We estimate the tail of F with
x − u −1/ˆγ

where Fn (u) is the empirical distribution function in u : Fn (u) = 1 − Nu /n. For
a given probability p, inverting Fˆ (x) then yields the following estimator for high
quantiles above the threshold u [7]: xˆp = u + σ

Next we choose the threshold u. For simplicity, denote k = Nu . ERM is
proposed for log-spacings of order statistics X1,n ≤ X2,n ≤ ... ≤ Xn,n [6,7]:
Zj,k = j log(Xn−j+1,n /Xn−j,n) ∼ (ξ + bn,k (

j −ρ
) )fj,k , 1 ≤ j ≤ k .

with {fj,k, 1 ≤ j ≤ k} a pure random sample from the standard exponential
distribution, shape parameter ξ, real constant ρ ≤ 0 and rate function b. The
k
Hill estimator is given for k ∈ {1, ..., n − 1} by Hk,n = k1 j=1 (log Xn−j+1,n −
log Xn−k,n ) .
We choose the threshold by the asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) of
the Hill estimator [7], given by
AMSE(Hk,n ) = Avar(Hk,n ) + Abias2 (Hk,n ) =

Similar to the adaptive threshold selection method [6], in the ERM we calˆ bn,k
ˆ , ρˆ with ML for each k = {3, ......, n − 1}. Determine
culate the estimates ξ,
AMSE(Hk,n ) for each k = {3, ......, n − 1} and then determine the optimal k with
kopt = argmink {AMSE}. Thus we choose Xn−kopt ,n as the threshold.

Data Set

For obvious reasons, operational risk data are hard to come by. This is to some
extent true for Chinese commercial banks. We collect 204 operational losses of
more than 20 banks from public media. The time of the database ranged from
1994 to 2006. We use quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot) to infer the tail behavior
of observed losses. From Fig. 1, the 204 public reported operational loss data are
heavy-tailed. (units: Ten thousand RMB)

Results and Analysis

From Table. 1, the threshold is u = 43200 ten thousand RMB. Almost 80%
operational losses are less than this, and most extreme values are beyond this.
So this threshold calculated sounds reasonable.

Since the shape parameter is used to characterize the tail behavior of a
distribution: the lager γ, the heavier the tail. The estimate we obtained γ =
1.505829 > 1 proves that the operational losses for Chinese commercial banks
are severely heavy-tailed. At the same time, within the 99.9% conﬁdence interval VaR(= 163319974) excluding the expected losses nearly accounts for 6%
to the average assets from 2003 to 2005 for Chinese commercial banks. As a
consequence, we should pay much attention on the operational risk, and at the
same time useful quantitative and qualitative approaches should be achieved for
Chinese commercial banks. At last, comparing with the VaR in Lijun Gao [4],
in which VaR = 136328000, we know both results are close to each other.

Conclusions

In this paper, we presented an ERM-POT to measure the operational risk of
extremely heavy-tailed loss data. Selection of the threshold by Hill plot or MEF
may produce biased estimates. The ERM-POT provides a solution to such problem. With ERM-POT, the optimal threshold is selected. and then VaR is obtained. From Table. 1, we know the threshold sounds reasonable and the new
method is useful .
