Abstract. Sampling theory is one of the most powerful results in signal analysis. The objective of sampling is to reconstruct a signal from
its samples. Walter extended the Shannon sampling theorem to wavelet
subspaces. In this paper we give a further characterization on some shiftinvariant subspaces, especially the closed subspaces on which the sampling theorem holds. For some shift-invariant subspaces with sampling
property, the sampling functions are explicitly given.

Introduction and Main Results

Sampling theory is one of the most powerful results in signal analysis. The objective of sampling is to reconstruct a signal from its samples. For example, the
classical Shannon theorem says that for each
1 1
f ∈ B 12 = {f ∈ L2 (R) : suppf ⊂ [− , ]},
2 2
f (x) =

∞
k=−∞

π(x−k)
f (k) sinπ(x−k)
, where the convergence is both in L2 (R) and uni∞

form on R, and the Fourier transform is deﬁned by f (ω) = −∞ f (x)e−2πixω dx.
If ψ(x) = sinπxπx , then {ψ(· − k)}k∈Z is an orthonormal basis for B 12 and B 12 is a
shift-invariant subspace in L2 (R).
The structure of ﬁnitely generated shift-invariant subspaces in L2 (R) is studied, e.g., in [1]-[6]. There are fruitful results in wavelet theory in the past 20 years
(see [7]-[12]). In [2], Janssen considered the shifted sampling and corresponding
aliasing error by means of Zak transform. Walter [1] extended the Shannon sampling theorem to wavelet subspaces. Zhou and Sun [13] characterized the general
shifted wavelet subspaces on which the sampling theorem holds:

Proposition 1 ([13]). Let V0 be a closed subspace in L2 (R) and {φ(· − n)}n∈Z
is a frame for V0 . Then the following two assertions are equivalent:
(i) k ck φ(x − k) converges pointwise to a continuous function for any {ck } ∈
l2 and there exists a frame {S(· − n)}n∈Z for V0 such that
f (k)S(x − k) for any f ∈ V0 ,

f (x) =
k

where the convergence is both in L2 (R) and uniform on R.
(ii) φ ∈ C(R), supx∈R k |φ(x − k)|2 < ∞ and there exist two positive constants A, B such that
φ(k)e−ikω ≤ BχEφ (ω), a.e.,

AχEφ (ω) ≤
k

where χ is the characteristic function, Eφ = {ω ∈ R :

2
k

φ(ω + 2kπ)

> 0}.

Moreover, it implies that for S in (i), f (k) = f, S(· − n) for any f ∈ V0 ,
where S is deﬁned in the following Proposition 3.
In this paper we characterize some shift-invariant subspaces, especially the closed
subspaces in L2 (R) such that the sampling theorem holds.
Notations. Firstly, we discuss functions in L2 (R). Therefore f = g means that
f (ω) = g(ω) for almost everywhere ω ∈ R. C(R) is the space of continuous
2

function. Gf (ω) =

k

f (ω + k) . It is easy to see that Gf is deﬁned only

a.e.. Ef = {ω ∈ R : Gf (ω) > 0} for any f ∈ L2 (R). χE is the characteris−i2πnω
for any f ∈ L2 (R) with
tic function of the set E. f ∗ (ω) =
n f (n)e
2
0
n |f (n)| < ∞. Vf = {g : g(·) =
n cn f (· − n), where the convergence is
in L2 (R) and {cn }n∈Z ∈ l2 }. Vf = {f (· − n)}n which means that any g ∈ Vf
can be approximated arbitrarily well in norm by a ﬁnite linear combinations of
vectors f (· − n). Moreover, Vf is called a shift-invariant subspace generated by
a.e
f . Let μ(·) be the Lebesgue measure on R. For E, F ⊂ R, E = F means that
μ(E \ F ) = μ(F \ E) = 0.
For φ ∈ L2 (R), if {φ(· − n)}n is a frame (Riesz basis) for Vφ then φ is called
a frame (Riesz) function.
Deﬁnition 1. A closed subspace V in L2 (R) is called a sampling space, if there
exists a frame {ψ(·−k)}k∈Z for V such that k ck ψ(x−k) converges pointwisely
to a continuous function for any {ck } ∈ l2 and
f (k)ψ(x − k) for any f ∈ V,

f (x) =
k

where the convergence is both in L2 (R) and uniform on R.
In this case, ψ is called a sampling function on V .

From the deﬁnition, we know that if V is a sampling space then for any f ∈ V
there exists a function g ∈ C(R) such that f (x) = g(x), a.e. x ∈ R. Therefore, in
what follows we assume that all the functions in a sampling space are continuous.
Next we denote the following three sets to characterize the functions with
sampling property.
P1 is the subset in L2 (R) ∩ C(R) in which each function φ satisﬁes that
2
k ck φ(x − k) converges pointwisely to a continuous function for any {ck } ∈ l .
P2 is the set of functions in which each function f satisﬁes the following three
conditions:
(i) f = 0, f ∈ L2 (R) ∩ C(R), k |f (k)|2 < ∞ and f is a bounded function;
(ii) μ({ω : f ∗ (ω) = 0, Gf (ω) = 0}) = 0;
(iii) There exist two positive constants A, B such that
Gf (ω)

A≤

P3 = {φ ∈ P2 : supx∈R

f ∗ (ω)

2

≤ B, a.e. ω ∈ Ef .

2

n

|φ(x − n)| < ∞}.

For any f ∈ P2 , it is easy to see that μ(Ef ) > 0 and f ∗ (ω), Gf (ω) are well
deﬁned almost everywhere.
Next we list the following propositions to be used in the proof of our results.
Proposition 2 ([3],[5]). Let φ ∈ L2 (R). φ is a frame function if and only if
there are constants A, B > 0 such that AχEφ ≤ Gφ ≤ BχEφ , a.e.
Especially, if φ is a Riesz function, then Eφ = R.
Proposition 3 ([3],[13]). Assume that f ∈ L2 (R) and f is a frame function.
Let
f (ω)
, if ω ∈ Ef
f (ω) = Gf (ω)
0,
if ω ∈
/ Ef
then {f (· − n)}n is a dual frame of {f (· − n)}n in Vf .
Proposition 4 ([13]). Let φ ∈ L2 (R). Then φ ∈ P if and only if the following
holds
(i) φ ∈ C(R),
2
(ii) k∈Z |φ(x − k)| ≤ M for some constant M > 0.
Proposition 5 ([5]). Vf = {g ∈ L2 (R) : g = τ f , where τ is a function with
period 1 and τ f ∈ L2 (R)}.
a.e

Proposition 6 ([5]). Let g ∈ Vf . Then Vg = Vf if and only if suppf = suppg.
Now we give the following theorem to check whether Vf is the maximum shiftinvariant subspace in L2 (R).

Theorem 7. Let f ∈ L2 (R). There exists g ∈ L2 (R) such that f ∈ Vg and
g∈
/ Vf if and only if there exists E ⊆ [0, 1] with μ(E) > 0 such that f (ω) = 0
for any ω ∈ k∈Z (k + E).
For a shift-invariant subspace Vf with sampling property, how can we ﬁnd its
sampling functions? For this, we give the following two theorems. Firstly, for any
f ∈ L2 (R) if f ∗ is well deﬁned, then we deﬁne
f (ω)
,
f ∗ (ω)

fp (ω) =

0,

if f ∗ (ω) = 0,
if f ∗ (ω) = 0.

(1)

Theorem 8. If f ∈ P2 , then {fp (· − n)}n is a frame for Vf .
Theorem 9. (i) Let f ∗ (ω) = 0, a.e. ω ∈ R. If S ∈ L2 (R) such that
f (k)S(x − k),

f (x) =
k

where the convergence is in L2 (R), then S = fp .
(ii) For any f ∈ P3 , let
f (ω)
,
f ∗ (ω)

S(ω) =

if f ∗ (ω) = 0,

R(ω), if f ∗ (ω) = 0,

where R ∈ L2 (R). Then for any g ∈ Vf0 , g(x) =

n

g(n)S(x − n).

Finally, we give the following equivalent characterization on shift-invariant subspaces with sampling property.
Theorem 10. Assume that V is a shift-invariant subspace. Then the following
assertions are equivalent:
(i) V is a sampling space.
(ii) For any φ ∈ C(R) such that {φ(· − n)}n is a frame for V , we have
2

|φ(x − n)| < ∞,

x

(2)

n

and there exist positive constants A, B such that
AχEφ (ω) ≤ φ∗ (ω) ≤ BχEφ (ω), a.e.

(3)

(iii) There exists φ ∈ C(R) such that {φ(· − n)}n is a frame for V and (2),
(3) hold.
(iv) There exists φ ∈ C(R) such that {φ(· − n)}n is a frame for V , (2)
holds and
|g(n)|2 ≤ B g 2 , ∀g ∈ V.
(4)
A g 2≤

for some positive constants A, B.
(v) There exists φ ∈ C(R) such that {φ(· − n)}n is a frame for V , (2) holds
and { l φ(k − l)φ(k − ·)}k is a frame for V .

Proof of Main Results

Proof of Theorem 7. [necessary] Assume that g ∈ L2 (R), f ∈ Vg and g ∈
/ Vf .
By Proposition 5 and Proposition 6, f = τ g where τ is a a function with period 1
and μ(suppg \ suppf) > 0. Then there exists E ∗ ∈ R with μ(E ∗ ) > 0 such that
g(ω) = 0, f (ω) = 0 for any ω ∈ E ∗ . Thus τ (ω) = 0 for any ω ∈ E ∗ . Let
T (E ∗ ) = {ω : ω ∈ [0, 1], there exists k ∈ Z such that ω + k ∈ E ∗ }.
Then τ (ω) = 0 for any ω ∈ T (E ∗ ). Since E ∗ ⊆ k∈Z (k + T (E ∗ )) and μ(E ∗ ) > 0,
we have μ(T (E ∗ )) > 0. Therefore, if we take E = T (E ∗ ), then E satisﬁes the
conditions in the theorem.
[suf f iciency] Assume that f ∈ L2 (R) and there exists E ⊆ [0, 1] with
μ(E) > 0 such that f (ω) = 0 for any ω ∈ k∈Z k + E. Let
g(ω) =

f (ω), if ω ∈
/ E,
1, if ω ∈ E.

Then f (ω) = τ (ω)g(ω) for any ω ∈ R, where
τ (ω) =

0, if ω ∈

+ E),
(k
+ E)
k∈Z

is a function with period 1 and μ(suppg \ suppf) > 0. Thus we have f ∈ Vg
and g ∈
/ Vf .
This completes the proof of Theorem 7.
Proof of Theorem 8. By (1) and f ∈ P2 , we have fp (ω) = τ (ω)f (ω), where
if ω ∈ Ef

f ∗ (ω)

τ (ω) =

Then

, if ω ∈ Ef
if ω ∈
/ Ef .

Since f ∈ P2 , there exist positive constants A, B such that AχEf ≤ Gfp ≤ BχEf .
However, τ is a function with period 1. By Proposition 5, fp ∈ Vf . It is from
suppf = suppfp and Proposition 6 that Vf = Vfp . Finally, by Proposition 2, fp
is a frame for Vf .
This completes the proof of Theorem 8.
Proof of Theorem 9. [(i)] Since f (x) =

have f (ω) = f (ω)S(ω), S(ω) =

f (ω)

f ∗ (ω)

f (k)S(x − k) and f ∗ (ω) = 0, we

Thus S = fp .

there exist {ck } ∈ l2 such that g(·) =

C ∗ (ω) = C(ω)χEf (ω). Then there exists {c∗k } ∈ l2 such that C ∗ (ω) =

. It follows from
k ck e
g(ω) = C(ω)f (ω) = C ∗ (ω)f (ω)
and Proposition 4 that g(x) = k c∗k f (x − k) converges pointwisely in R. By
Theorem 8, fp is a frame for Vf . Then using Proposition 3, fp is a dual frame
of {f (· − n)}n∈Z in Vf . Thus
C ∗ (ω)

Thus we get g(x) =

n

g(n)fp (x − n). Let h(ω) = R(ω)χ{ω:f ∗ (ω)=0} . Then

S(ω) = fp (ω) + h(ω), S = fp + h.
Since g(n) =
Then

g ∗ (ω)h(ω) = 0,

g(n)h(x − n) = 0.
n

Therefore
g(n)(fp (x − n) + h(x − n)) =

g(x) =
n

g(n)S(x − n).
n

This completes the proof of Theorem 9.
For the proof of Theorem 10, we give the following Lemma.
Lemma 1. Assume that φ ∈ P1 is a frame function. If f ∈ Vφ satiﬁes f (ω) =
b(ω)φ(ω), where b(ω) is a function with period 1 and bounded on Eφ , then f ∈ P1 .
Specially, for any frame function ψ ∈ Vφ , we have ψ ∈ P1 .
Proof. Assume that f ∈ Vφ satisﬁes f (ω) = b(ω)φ(ω), where b(ω) is a function
with period 1 and bounded on Eφ . Let B(ω) = b(ω)χEφ (ω). Since B(ω) is
bounded on [− 21 , 12 ], there exists {Bn } ∈ l2 such that B(ω) = n Bn e−i2πnω .
Since φ ∈ P1 and
f (ω) = b(ω)φ(ω) = B(ω)φ(ω),
we have f ∈ C(R) and f (x) = n Bn φ(x − n), where the convergence is both
in L2 (R) and pointwisely.

Now using φ ∈ P1 and Proposition 4, we have supx∈R n |φ(x − n)| < ∞.
Hence

Then by f ∈ C(R), (5) and Proposition 4, we get f ∈ P1 .
For any frame function ψ ∈ Vφ , there exists a function τ with period 1 such
that ψ(ω) = τ (ω)φ(ω), then Gψ = |τ (ω)|2 Gφ (ω). By Proposition 2, τ is bounded
on Eφ . Thus ψ ∈ P1 .
This completes the proof of Lemma 1.
Proof of Theorem of 10. (i) ⇒ (ii) Given any continuous function φ such
that {φ(· − n)}n is a frame for sampling space V . Let ψ be a sampling function
for V . By Proposition 4, supx∈R n |ψ(x − n)|2 < ∞.
Let φ(ω) = b(ω)ψ(ω), where b(ω) = k bk e−i2πkω for some {ck } ∈ l2 . Then
2
Gφ (ω) = |b(ω)| Gψ (ω). By Proposition 2, b(ω) is bounded on Eψ . By Lemma 1,
φ ∈ P1 . Then by Proposition 1, we get (ii).
(ii) ⇒ (iii) It is trivial.
(iii) ⇒ (i) By Proposition 1, there exists a frame {ψ(· − n)}n for V such that
f (x) = n f (n)ψ(x− n) for any f ∈ V . By Lemma 1 and Proposition 4, ψ ∈ P1 .
Thus we get (i).
(iv) ⇒ (i) For any n ∈ Z, T g = g(n) is a bounded linear functional on V .
Then there exists Sn ∈ V such that
g(n) = g, Sn for any n ∈ Z, g ∈ V.
Let S := S0 and g1 (x) = g(x + 1), for any g ∈ V, x ∈ R. Then
g1 , S = g1 (0) = g(1) = g, S1 .
Thus for any g ∈ V , we have
g(x)S(x − 1)dx =

g(x + 1)S(x)dx =

= g, S1 =

g1 (x)S(x)dx = g1 (0) = g(1)

g(x)S1 (x)dx.

Thus S1 (x) = S(x−1). Similarly, we have Sn (x) = S(x−n) for any n ∈ Z, x ∈ R.
Therefore
g(n) = g, S(· − n) for any g ∈ V.
Now by (4), S is a frame for V . Let S be deﬁned as Proposition 3. Then
by Lemma 1 and Proposition 4, S is the sampling function for V . Therefore
we get (i).
(i) ⇐⇒ (iv) Note that in Proposition 1, f (n) = f, S(· − n) for any f ∈ V0 ,
where {S(· − n)}n is a frame for V0 . Thus it is just from Proposition 1.

1028

(iv) ⇐⇒ (v) Assume that there exists a continuous function φ which is a
2
frame function for V such that supx n |φ(x − n)| < ∞. Then by Lemma 1, we
have φ ∈ P1 . Therefore qx (·) := l φ(x − l)φ(· − l) convergences both in L2 (R)
and uniformly on R.
Now for any g ∈ V ,
g, φ(· − k) φ(x − k) for any x ∈ R.

g, qx =

(6)

k

The last series converges both in L2 (R) to g and uniformly to g, qx . Thus
g(x) = g, qx for any x ∈ R.

(7)

If (iv) holds, then there exist two positive constants A, B such that
A g

2

| g, qk |2 ≤ B g

≤

2

for any g ∈ V.

k

Thus {qk (·)}k = { l φ(k − l)φ(k − ·)}k is a frame for V . We get (v).
If (v) holds, then {qk (·)}k is a frame for V . By (6) and (7), we get (iv).
This completes the proof of Theorem 10.
