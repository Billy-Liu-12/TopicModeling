Abstract. Many algorithms have been proposed for deriving regulatory
networks from microarray gene expression data. The performance of such
algorithms is often measured by how well the resulting network can recreate the gene expression data that it was derived from. However, this kind
of performance does not necessarily mean that the regulatory hypotheses
in the network are biologically plausible. We therefore propose a method
for assessing the biological plausibility of regulatory hypotheses using
prior knowledge in the form of regulatory pathway databases and Gene
Ontology-based annotation of gene products. A set of templates is derived by generalising from known interactions to typical properties of
interacting gene product pairs. By searching for matches in this set of
templates, the plausibility of regulatory hypotheses can be assessed. We
evaluate to what degree the collection of templates can separate true
from false positive interactions, and we illustrate the practical use of the
method by applying it to an example network reconstruction problem.

Introduction

It is highly desirable to be able to derive causal gene regulatory networks using
gene expression data. This is known as reverse engineering of genetic networks[1].
Time series expression data is often used, and the task of the reverse engineering
algorithm is to ﬁnd a set of activation rules that ﬁts these data. Methods for reverse engineering of genetic networks that have been proposed include techniques
such as boolean [2, 3], neural [4, 5] and Bayesian networks [6, 7, 8]. In most cases,
however, many diﬀerent reverse engineered networks are consistent with the observed data, but we can expect only a few of these networks to be biologically
plausible. A drawback of reverse engineering methods which are based solely on
ﬁt to the data is that they do not provide any way of distinguishing between
biologically plausible and implausible networks. Therefore, we here propose a
method for assessing the biological plausibility of regulatory hypotheses using
prior biological knowledge in the form of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of
gene products and examples of regulatory interactions from pathway databases.
Using GO, we derive templates encoding general knowledge by generalising from
examples of known interactions to typical properties of interacting gene product
pairs. By matching regulatory hypotheses to such templates, their plausibility

can be assessed. The assumption is that if the properties of the gene products in
a regulatory hypothesis are similar to those of gene products which are already
known to interact, this increases the plausibility of the hypothesis.
Gene Ontology [9] is a structured vocabulary of molecular biology. It contains
three diﬀerent sub-ontologies covering the molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components of gene products, and is structured as a directed
acyclic graph showing how terms are related to each other, using inheritance (ISA) and aggregation (PART-OF). Using these relations, abstraction hierarchies
of terms with diﬀerent speciﬁcity are created. A gene product can be associated
with several terms in each sub-ontology. One important use of an ontology is
the calculation of semantic similarity between two terms. Diﬀerent information
theoretic measures have been proposed and applied for this purpose [10, 11, 12]
and ideas from these measures are used in our method.
The concept of templates is appealing for identifying hypothetical regulatory
relations that are similar to known regulatory relations. Templates have previously been used in the context of association rule discovery and expression data
in [13], where a template-language was designed that allows users to group, ﬁlter
and inspect a large number of rules produced by association rule discovery algorithms. Of particular interest for our work are rule templates F 1 → F 2 which
detect rules where the antecedent part contains any of the genes in a predeﬁned functional group F 1 and the consequent part contains a gene from another
predeﬁned group F 2.
The basic idea behind the method proposed here is to use what we know
about regulation in documented pathways, generalise this knowledge, and apply
it for assessment of the plausibility of regulatory hypotheses. The GO molecular
function classiﬁcation of the gene products participating in regulatory relations
in pathways is used to derive templates. The templates encode the types of gene
products known to be involved in a particular type of regulatory relation.

Methods and Algorithms

The three main steps of the method are: (1) GO term probability calculation,
(2) binary relation extraction, and (3) template derivation.
Step 1: GO term probability calculation. The GO term probability calculation is done as speciﬁed in [14] using annotations of the S. cerevisiae Genome
Database (SGD) available at the GO website (http://www.geneontology.org,
September 2005). The term probability calculation is deﬁned as follows, where
DA is a GO annotation database for gene products (in this case SGD):
– For each gene product GPi ∈ DA :
- Increment a counter CN Tj for each GO term GTj in the annotation of
GPi and increment the counter of each ancestor term of GTj .
– For each GO term GTk :
Tk
- Calculate the term probability p(GTk ) = CN
NA , where NA is the total
number of annotations in DA .

The term probabilities indicate how speciﬁc, or common, diﬀerent GO terms
are, and they are used as a measure of speciﬁcity of relation templates. The
speciﬁcity increases with decreasing term probability.
Step 2: Binary relation extraction. Each relation between protein complexes
is decomposed into a set of binary relations between pairs of gene products. These
binary relations are subsequently used to derive templates. In the following, DP
is a regulatory pathway database, Ci and Cj refer to complexes containing sets
of gene products, and rel is a speciﬁc relation type, e.g. ”expression”:
– For each complex relation Ci [rel]Cj ∈ DP :
- Create |Ci | · |Cj | binary relations GPk [rel]GPl by combining each gene
product in Ci with each gene product in Cj , and add all new relations
to a set M OD of model relations.
Step 3: Template derivation. Templates representing generalised knowledge
of regulatory relations are derived. For each template a GO-score GS is calculated, based on how common the two GO terms appearing in the template
are in the annotation database. This is formalised as the average information
content of the template terms, using standard information theoretic principles.
Templates are derived by the following procedure, where GID represents a GO
identiﬁer:
– For each binary relation GPk [rel]GPl ∈ M OD:
- Create templates GIDi [rel]GIDj where GIDi ∈ Sk ={GPk terms with
ancestors} and GIDj ∈ Sl ={GPl terms with ancestors}, yielding |Sk | ·
|Sl | templates. Add these templates to a set T .
– For each template GIDi [rel]GIDj ∈ T :
GS = −log2 ((p(GIDi ) + p(GIDj ))/2).
Using this information-theoretic deﬁnition of GS we get GS ∈ [0, −log2 (1/NA )],
where NA is the total number of annotations in DA . In order to facilitate interpretation of GS values and to make it easier to set a threshold for which
hypotheses to consider plausible we also calculate an “expect” value E for each
hypothesis Hi according to:
E(Hi ) = |H| ·

|{t : t ∈ T ∧ GS(t) ≥ GS(Hi )}|
|T |

(1)

where H is the hypothesis set and E(Hi ) the expected number of template hits
for Hi with GS(t) ≥ GS(Hi ) if templates are randomly drawn from T .
We refer to templates based only on annotation level terms (terms directly
associated with the gene products in DA ) as “basic templates”, while templates
containing GO terms of higher abstraction levels are referred to as “variant
templates”. When initially testing the approach using the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle
pathway relations from KEGG as input, the method derived 68 basic templates,
all with GO-scores in the interval [4.84,11.29], and 1236 variant templates with
GO-scores in the interval [0,10.97]. 54% of these variant templates had a GS
lower than the lower bound for the basic templates.

As an example to illustrate the process of template derivation, we here consider the complex-to-complex relation {SWI4,SWI6} [+e] {CLN1,CLN2} in the
S. cerevisiae cell cycle pathway (ﬁgure 1). This relation between gene product complexes is decomposed into the four binary relations ”SWI4 [+e] CLN1”,
”SWI4 [+e] CLN2”, ”SWI6 [+e] CLN1” and ”SWI6 [+e] CLN2”. Each of these
are used for template derivation. When ”SWI4 [+e] CLN1” is used, each of the
terms in the GO subgraph of SWI4 in ﬁgure 2 are combined with those for CLN1
to create templates. The basic template in this case would be ”GO:0003700 [+e]
GO:0016538”, with a GO-score of −log2 ((0.010+0.003)/2)) = 7.27. Variant templates are for example ”GO:0003700 [+e] GO:0019887” and ”GO:0030528 [+e]
GO:0019207”, with GO-scores −log2 ((0.010+0.005)/2)) = 7.06 and −log2 ((0.052
+0.005)/2))=5.13, respectively. With six terms for SWI4 and ﬁve terms for
CLN1, there is a total of 30 templates for this relation (one basic and 29 variant
templates).
The derived set of templates is used in the assessment of hypothetical regulatory relations derived using e.g. reverse engineering algorithms. A hypothetical relation (or hypothesis for short) is deﬁned as a directed relation between
two gene products. There can be diﬀerent relation types, e.g. ”expression” and
”phosphorylation”. Each hypothesis GP hk [rel]GP hl from a set H of regulatory
hypotheses is assessed by the templates using the following procedure:
– For each template GIDi [rel]GIDj ∈ T :
- Report template match if GIDi ∈ {GP hk terms with ancestors} and
GIDj ∈ {GP hl terms with ancestors}.

This procedure results in a list of templates conforming to the hypothesis, ranked
in GO-score order. Subsequently, all hypotheses in H can be ranked in GO-score
order according to the highest-scoring template of each hypothesis.

Results

This section presents experiments done to assess the performance and to show
the practical use of the proposed method for plausibility assessment. Out of
the 12 types of regulatory relations supported by KEGG, we selected ”activation”, ”inhibition”, ”expression”, ”phosphorylation” and ”dephosphorylation”.
The only relation representing transcriptional regulation is ”expression”, while
the other four represent post-translational regulatory mechanisms.
In the evaluation, we study sets of hypothetical relations derived by applying
a dynamic Bayesian network technique to gene expression data measuring the
expression of genes during the S. cerevisiae cell cycle. Hypotheses derived in [15]
are shown together with their best-scoring templates in table 1. Each hypothesis
in the table is classiﬁed into one of four diﬀerent categories of conformance with
respect to the target network in ﬁgure 1: correct, transitive, misdirected and
incorrect [7]. The hypothetical relations are limited to cover only the part of
the cell cycle shown in ﬁgure 1. Relations from the whole S. cerevisiae cell cycle
pathway were used to derive the template set.

hypothetical relation between two gene products, derived in ref. [15]. T emplate: GO
term identiﬁer for the left hand side of the template, followed by type of relation in
square brackets (E = ”expression”, P = ”phosphorylation”, I = ”inhibition”), and GO
term identiﬁer for the right hand side of the template. Sc: GO-score of the template.
E: the expected number of hits with a GO-score greater than or equal to the matching
template’s GO-score (see eq. 1). Cl: hypothesis class, coded as in ref. [7] (C = correct
edge with respect to the known model, T = transitive edge which skips exactly one
gene product, M = misdirected edge, I = incorrect edge). The left half of the table
shows hypotheses with E < 1 and the right half those with E ≥ 1. Note that all ﬁve
correct hypotheses have E < 1. In addition, correct hypotheses had the lowest average
E, followed by transitive hypotheses, while mis-directed and incorrect hypotheses had
substantially higher average E (C: 0.62, T : 0.96, I: 3.07, M : 3.48).

for their plausibility. The results are visualised in ﬁgure 3, showing the accumulation of hypotheses from diﬀerent classes as a function of GO-score. It can be
noted that the curve representing the class of ”correct” hypotheses reaches 100%
before any other class, while the class ”incorrect” is the last to reach this level.
This suggests that templates and their GO-scores are useful in the evaluation of
hypothesis sets derived from data mining. For another hypothesis set, derived in
[7], the diagram at the right in ﬁgure 3 shows that the results are similar.

Discussion

We proposed a method based on the generalisation of knowledge of regulatory
pathways for assessing the biological plausibility of hypotheses derived during
regulatory network reconstruction. Our results demonstrate that the method is
able to ﬁlter out a large proportion of implausible hypotheses, thus improving
the speciﬁcity of the regulatory network reconstruction process.
Gene products in some hypotheses are identical or very similar to gene products in relations used for template derivation, with respect to GO functional
annotation. This means that the hypotheses are highly feasible, according to
our current general knowledge, while at the same time current speciﬁc knowledge would suggest that they are incorrect. It is possible that a future more
ﬁne-grained GO annotation will allow us to better discriminate between such hypotheses. It is also possible that future experiments show that some of these hypothetical relations actually exist. A way to get higher accuracy for our method
could be to incorporate other sources of biological knowledge, such as transcription factor binding site information or protein interactions.
Our method decomposes relations between gene product complexes into
atomic binary relations between individual gene products. This leads to certain problems, as can be observed e.g. for the CLN3-CDC28 complex in ﬁgure
1. In order to form this complex, CLN3 will bind to the CDC28 kinase and the
complex as a unit will phosphorylate SWI6. Hence, it is not entirely true that
CLN3 and CDC28 individually phosphorylate SWI6 as our method suggests. We
plan to extend our method so that complex relations can be handled without
being decomposed into binary relations.
Our method automatically identiﬁes the biologically most plausible hypotheses by a measure based on GO term speciﬁcity, but it would also be beneﬁcial to
have the top scoring hypotheses assessed by a domain expert in order to reduce
the number of false positives.
