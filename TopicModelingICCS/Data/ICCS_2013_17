Abstract
In this paper, the performance of the second- and fourth-order accurate Castillo-Grone Mimetic (CGM) gradient and divergence
operator for solving advection equations, in conjunction with the RK3 time discretization scheme, is investigated. In addition,
the eﬀect of diﬀerent interpolation schemes on the CGM operator’s stability is also studied numerically. It has been shown
that, in all cases, the CGM operators were stable for Courant numbers higher than 1, and in some cases, up to a Courant
number of 1.8. Furthermore, in the case of the fourth-order accurate CGM divergence operator and linear interpolation, the
ampliﬁcation factor is calculated analytically using the Von Neumann stability analysis method, and the accuracy and stability
of the combined CGM and RK3 scheme is also discussed.
Keywords: Castillo-Grone Mimetic Operators, High-Order Operators, Time-Split Scheme, RK3, Stability Analysis

1. Introduction
Both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic ocean and atmosphere models must deal with diﬀerent scales of motion
and forces with a wide range of frequencies. To capture features with diﬀerent frequencies, a varying time step is
needed. In order to address the wide range of frequencies with a single time step, a time-splitting method is often
used within these models [1]. There are various, explicit time-splitting schemes available: Klemp and Wilhelmson
combined a leapfrog and a forward-backward scheme [2] to derive one of the most commonly used schemes back
in 1978 [3], and the Crowley scheme is another splitting method for time integration [4]. Wicker and Skamarock
have introduced several versions of their time-splitting scheme, based on the two-step Runge-Kutta method (RK2)
[5] and the third-order Runge-Kutta method (RK3), which has shown its superiority in time integration [6]. The
accuracy, eﬃciency, and ease of implementation of their RK3 scheme motivated the authors of this paper to use
the same time-splitting scheme in the Uniﬁed Curvilinear Ocean Atmosphere Model (UCOAM) [7]. It should be
noted that the RK3 is currently being used in the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model, which is the
most commonly used model in the ﬁeld [8, 9].
However, time integration is only one aspect that needs to be addressed: other factors aﬀecting stability in
elastic models and advective equations are (1) spatial discretization [10, 11, 12] and (2) interpolation schemes [6].
The combination of the spatial discretization and the time integration is particularly important. For example, a

central spatial scheme is unconditionally unstable with the RK2 or Euler methods [11]. It is also widely known
that, in general, increasing the order of accuracy will limit the stability regions in many cases; hence, a much
smaller time step must be selected [11].
Interpolation has a similar eﬀect; while higher order interpolation schemes are more accurate, they also limit
the stability region. As an example, Wicker and Skamarock have shown that the stable Courant number decreases
from 1.61 to 1.08 when the order of accuracy of the interpolator function is increased from three to six while using
their RK3 scheme in conjunction with a second-order spatial discretization scheme [6].
This paper extends the work of Wicker and Skamarock [6] by investigating the performance of CastilloGrone Mimetic (CGM) divergence operators with higher orders of accuracy. Mimetic schemes are a class of
numerical schemes that satisfy the physical properties of their continuous operator in a discrete environment
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In this paper, the fourth-order CGM divergence and gradient operator, along with ﬁrst, fourth-, and sixth-order accurate interpolation methods are tested and their performance is reported. The reason
for considering ﬁrst-order accurate linear interpolation comes from the authors’ interest in using NVIDIA’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). GPUs have special circuitry for one-, two-, and three-dimensional linear/bilinear/
trilinear interpolation. Therefore, the interpolation can be done very quickly and eﬃciently at the hardware level;
although the same circuitry can be harnessed for higher-order interpolation schemes with additional software.
The next section covers governing equations and various discretization schemes. Later, the results of each
method are presented and the region of stability is discussed based on the stable Courant number that has been
obtained numerically. Additionally, through use of the Von Neumann stability analysis method, the stability of the
CGM fourth-order accurate divergence operator with the RK3 and linear interpolation is also discussed.
2. Numerical Approach
2.1. Governing Equation
The advection equation in the absence of any source or sink term can be formulated in non-conservative form
using the gradient operator, as follows:
∂q
+ u · (q) = 0,
∂t
where q is a scalar quantity and u = Const. is the advection velocity. Using the continuity equation, i.e.
equation (1) can be written in conservative form using the divergence operator, as follows:

(1)
· u = 0,

∂q
+ · (uq) = 0.
(2)
∂t
In this paper, both forms of the equation are investigated. The CGM gradient operator is used with equation
(1) and the CGM divergence operator is used with equation (2).
2.2. Initial and Boundary Conditions
q is initialized with
1
,
(3)
1 + e|80(z−0.15)|
where z = |x − 0.5| and x ∈ [0, 1]. A periodic boundary condition is selected, dx and dt are kept constant at 0.02,
and u is chosen based on the given Courant number, i.e. u = Cr dx dt−1 .
q(x, t = 0) =

2.3. Spatial Discretization
2.3.1. KWM Scheme
Due to their nature, it is widely believed that a forward or backward step works better for advective terms.
Kawamura et al. [20] combined a forward and a backward scheme into a single equation in curvilinear coordinates.
This scheme, abbreviated here as KWM, is fourth-order accurate and does not require interpolation. Adapting the
KWM scheme for regularly-spaced grids, the KWM scheme is written as:
u

∂q
∂x

= ui
i

qi+2 − 4qi+1 + 6qi − 4qi−1 + qi−2
−qi+2 + 8(qi+1 − qi−1 ) + qi−2

2.3.2. Castillo-Grone Gradient and Divergence Operators
Both second- and fourth-order CGM gradient and divergence operators are used in this paper. For more detail
on how these operators are constructed, the reader can refer to references [14, 16, 15, 17, 18]. The fourth-order
accurate CGM gradient and divergence operators are each part of a three-parameter family of operators. Here, we
use only one member of each family, corresponding to the following parameters:
(α, β, γ) = (0,

2.4. RK3 Scheme
In this paper a three-step time-splitting scheme, ﬁrst introduced by Wicker and Skamarock [6], is used to
integrate the equations provided in the form:

3. Von Neumann Stability Analysis
Von Neumann stability analysis is the most commonly used method, and was developed in 1944 at Los Alamos
National Laboratory [21] to study the behavior and stability of a numerical scheme. The method was ﬁrst distributed amongst a small interested group, and was later published publicly [22, 23, 24, 25]. In this method, each
Fourier component of the solution is replaced by
(8)
qni = V n eIkx (iΔx) = V n eIθ ,
√
where (I, θ, k x ) = ( −1, k x Δx, 2π/λ) with λ being the wavelength and V n is the amplitude function at time step
n. Deﬁning G = V n+1 /V n as the ampliﬁcation factor, one can discover how the error and solution vary with time.
For the solution to remain bounded, one must have |G| ≤ 1 for all θ. This provides the stability criteria for the
numerical scheme in use for a given application.
Using the fourth-order accurate CGM divergence operator with linear interpolation and the RK3 scheme for
time discretization (CGMD4I1RK3) in equation (2), the ampliﬁcation factor can be calculated as follows:
G

= (1 − 677c2 )

(9)

+C 2 cos(4θ) − 52c2 (cos(3θ) − 13cos(2θ) − cos(θ)) + I −c3
+676sin(4θ) −

sin(6θ)
− 26sin(5θ)
3

17498
sin(3θ) − 1353sin(2θ) + 17628sin(θ) + 2c(sin(2θ) − 26sin(θ)) ,
3

where c = u · dt/(48dx) = Cr /48. Figure (1) shows the stable region of the ampliﬁcation factor calculated
above. If the solution contains only low or high wave numbers, the stable Courant number using CGMD4I1RK3
can become very high (even higher than 2), unlike most methods that time step is needed to be decreased by
decreasing spatial discretization. However, in cases where all wave numbers are present, such as in atmospheric
and oceanic modeling, the maximum stable Courant number is approximately 1.66. This also agrees with the

468

Mohammad Abouali and Jose E. Castillo / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 465 – 472

experimental approach that is presented in the next section in Figure (7). Figure (1) also shows that, for a given
wavenumber, by increasing the Courant number, the ampliﬁcation factor ﬁrst decreases and then increases. This
behavior explains the reason that, in some previous work [26], it was seen that by increasing the time step, i.e.
increasing the Courant number, lower errors are obtained.

discretization scheme.

It can be seen that the ampliﬁcation factor for the CGM operators combined with the RK3 scheme is not a
simple function. In the next section, an experimental approach is used to determine the stable Courant number.
4. Results and Discussions
MATLAB was used to solve equations (1) and (2) numerically using the discretization schemes shown in the
previous sections. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all cases, and the number of iterations was chosen
in such a way that the initial signal passes through the domain twice before reaching its original position. Since
the velocity is kept constant throughout the space and time, in a perfect case, one must get exactly the same signal.
However, in practice, due to numerical errors, this will never happen. To measure the error, the root mean square
error (RMSE) was used.
The KWM scheme produced very smooth and relatively accurate results. However, it was stable only up
to a Courant number of 0.6. Once Cr > 0.63 was chosen, the scheme became unstable. The RMSE for this
method stays relatively constant and does not change with an increase of the Courant number. Hence, unlike
other methods, there is no sign that this scheme is becoming unstable, until suddenly, after increasing the Courant
number, the scheme becomes completely unstable; this is not a desirable behavior. Figure (2) shows the solution
using the Kawamura scheme.
The second-order accurate CGM divergence operator also provided smooth results. When a fourth-order
interpolation scheme was used, the scheme was stable up to a Courant number of 1.3; and was stable up to a
Courant number 1.1 for a sixth-order interpolation scheme. However, the sixth-order interpolation scheme resulted
in increased accuracy only at lower Courant numbers, and once the Courant number reached 0.7, both methods
behaved more or less the same. In ﬁgure (3) the numerical solution is compared with the analytic solution using
the second-order CGM divergence operator with fourth- and sixth-order interpolation schemes, respectively.
Before discussing the results obtained using the CGM gradient operator, it must be noted that the CGM gradient operator was developed for staggered meshes. The CGM gradient operator requires the data to be in the
middle of the cells, as well as on the ﬁrst and last node on the boundary. However, the gradient itself is calculated
at the nodes. For better understanding, refer to ﬁgure (4). Now, remember that in this paper, the variable q is
stored only at the cell centers and not on the nodes. Hence, to solve equation (1) using the CGM gradient, one

needs to calculate the gradient at the middle of the cells where the data exists. This leaves us with a diﬀerent
implementation.
In the ﬁrst approach, denoted as V1, the data is ﬁrst interpolated from the cell centers to the boundary points
using either a linear or fourth-order interpolation scheme. To do so, the periodic boundary condition is also used.
Once the gradient is calculated at the nodes using the CGM gradient operator, it is linearly interpolated to the
cell centers. For further information refer to ﬁgure (5). Hence, in the V1 approach, the calculated gradient is
interpolated to the cell centers.
In the second approach, denoted as V2, it is assumed that the domain begins at the middle of the ﬁrst cell and
ends at the middle of the last cell. The data is then interpolated from the cell centers to all the interior nodes.
Hence, once the CGM gradient operator is applied, the gradient is calculated at the cell centers of the original grid
and there is no need to interpolate the calculated gradient. For further information refer to ﬁgure (5). It should be
noted that in this case, only higher-order interpolation is possible; otherwise, the boundary conditions wont aﬀect
the solution.
The third approach, denoted as V3, is similar to V1, except that once the gradient is calculated at the nodes, a
fourth-order interpolator is used to obtain the gradient at the cell centers. All methods produce a relatively smooth
solution. V1’s solutions shown the most error; however, it was stable up to a Courant number 1.8 for both linear
and fourth-order interpolation. V2 and V3 were both stable up to a Courant number of 1.3, and were both more
accurate than V1. V2 achieved less accuracy at lower Courant numbers relative to V3. Figure (6) shows a sample
output of the diﬀerent implementations. By increasing the order of accuracy of the operators, the stable Courant
number decreases; however, for the fourth-order accurate CGM operators, the lowest stable Courant number was
1.1. Figure (7) shows the RMSE and the stable Courant number for all of the methods compared together.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, diﬀerent CGM operators with varying order of accuracy in conjunction with RK3 time discretization were used to solve both the conservative and non-conservative form of the advection equation. Moreover the

Fig. 5. V1 Approach (left), data is located at the cell centers only. Using the boundary condition, data is interpolated at the boundary nodes
to satisfy the grid requirements of the CGM gradient operator. The gradient is then calculated at the nodes and linearly interpolated to the cell

cell centers directly. Hence, there is no need to interpolate the calculated gradient.

eﬀect of various interpolation schemes was studied. It was seen that in all cases the combination of CGM operators for spatial discretization and RK3 for time discretization outperformed the standard method used in this ﬁeld
and published in previous papers. It was seen that the proposed scheme resulted into a stable scheme for Courant
number higher than one in all cases. It was also shown that if the solution consists either low or high wavenumber one can use a Courant number even higher than two. However, if all scales of motion exist in the solution,
which is common in atmospheric and oceanic modeling, the maximum stable Courant number was found to be
1.8, experimentally. It was also seen that, in some cases, in order to decrease the error one can choose a higher
Courant number or larger time step. Although it has to be mentioned that decreasing the time step will not make
the scheme unstable. This can lead to a better performance since it gives more ﬂexibility in choosing the time
step by decreasing the spatial discretization size, i.e. dx. This is the ﬁrst paper, investigating the stability feature
of CGM operators using von Neumann stability analysis method. Although, in this paper the stability analysis
were done analytically only for one case (and numerically for other cases); the authors are working on analytic
investigation of stability in all cases and they hope to present those works in future publications.
