Abstract. An eﬃcient treatment is developed for the Schr¨
odinger equation with a class of local absorbing boundary conditions, which are obtained by high order Pad´e expansions. These boundary conditions are
signiﬁcant in the simulation of open quantum devices. Based on the ﬁnite
diﬀerence approximation in the interior domain, we construct a spectral
collocation layer on the cell near the artiﬁcial boundary, in which the
wave function is approximated by the Chebyshev polynomials. The numerical examples are given by using this strategy with increasingly high
order of accuracy up to the ninth order.
Keywords: Absorbing boundary conditions, Schr¨
odinger equation, semiconductor devices, Chebyshev spectral collocation, diﬀerence schemes.

Introduction

For numerical simulations of quantum mechanical models for semiconductor devices, it is important and challenging to design an eﬀective open boundary condition which absorbs outgoing waves [1]. In this paper, we consider high-order
local absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) for the Schr¨
odinger equation
i ψt (x, t) = −

which models quantum waveguides and resonant tunneling structures. Here we
assume that the initial data ψ(x, 0) = f (x) is compactly support in a closed
region Ω, and the given potential V is assumed to be a constant V0 outside Ω
so that there is no incoming wave on the truncated boundaries ∂Ω.
One way is to construct the transparent boundary condition (TBC) by approximating the exact solution of the exterior problem restricted to the ﬁnite
computational domain Ω. There are many papers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] developing
TBCs and studying their diﬀerence approximations and stability. However, the
obtained TBC through this way is nonlocal in t, thus requiring all the history
data in memory. Moreover, the computational eﬀort of an ad-hoc discretization
is unacceptable high.

To attain a method with low computational cost, another way is to construct ABCs [9,10,11,12,13] by approximating the nonlocal operator in TBC
with polynomials. This class of boundary conditions is local in time, and easy
to implement. In addition, they can be applied to nonlinear problems such as
optical ﬁber communications [14] through a local time-splitting approach [15].
An eﬃcient implementation of ABCs with high-order rational polynomial approximations is urgently required for the accurate solution of the Schr¨
odinger
equation (for a recent review paper, see Hagstrom [16]). However, it is also very
diﬃcult due to the high-order derivatives of the ABCs and their weak illposedness [12]. For this, we construct a spectral collocation layer on the cell near the
boundary. The Chebyshev spectral method, which is very eﬃcient for high-order
equations [17,18], can be practically implemented in the layer, together with
ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations in interior domain.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In §2, high-order local ABCs
are formulated. In §3, numerical issues are discussed. In §4, several numerical
examples are given to illustrate the performance of the method. §5 gives some
concluding remarks.

Construction of Absorbing Boundary Conditions

Consider the one-dimensional Schr¨
odinger equation
iψt (x, t) = −ψxx (x, t) + V (x, t)ψ(x, t),

(2)

which models the transient behavior of electrons in a quantum waveguide. Here
the coeﬃcients are absorbed into the derivatives for simplicity. We truncate the
unbounded domain to a ﬁnite one [−L, L] so that the initial value f (x) = 0 and
the potential V (x, t) = V0 for |x| ≥ L.
We concentrate on the right boundary. Similar discussion can be performed
on the left boundary. General wave packets propagating to the right at x = L
are represented by

where ψ,

domain. From Eq. (3), the TBC [1] in transformed space

which annihilates all the outgoing waves, is given by

It is a nonlocal boundary condition. In order to get local boundary
conditions

which allow a minor reﬂection, we approximate the square root ω − V0 by using

polynomials or rational polynomials. Note that k = ω − V0 is √
positive. The
zero- and ﬁrst-order Taylor approximations centered ω0 with k0 = ω0 − V0 > 0
to the square root give
ω − V0 = k0 + O(ω − ω0 ),
ω − V0
ω − V0 = k0 +
2k0
where the wavenumber parameter k0 can be adaptively picked through a windowed Fourier transform [19]. These approximations at once lead to the ﬁrstand second order ABCs
B1 ψ = iψx + k0 ψ = 0,
B2 ψ = iψt + i2k0 ψx + (2k02 − V0 )ψ = 0.
Higher-order Taylor approximations usually lead to ill-posed problems as
shown for the hyperbolic wave equation in Engquist and Majda [20] and for
the convection-diﬀusion equation in Halpern [21], in which the authors showed
that a hierarchy of Pad´e approximations shall lead to well-posed problems.
For
√
the Schr¨
odinger equation (2), the (n, n)-Pad´e approximations to ω − V0 can
be deduced through a recursive relation, as
ω − V0 = k0 Pn /Qn + O(ω − ω0 )2n+1 ,

(6)

with P0 = Q0 = 1 and
Pn = (ω − V0 + k02 )Pn−1 + 2(ω − V0 )Qn−1 ,
Qn = (ω − V0 + k02 )Qn−1 + 2k02 Pn−1 .
And for (n + 1, n)−Pad´e approximations, the recursive relation is
ω − V0 = k0 Pn /Qn + O(ω − ω0 )2n+2 ,

(7)

with P0 = ω − V0 + k02 , Q0 = 2k02 and
Pn = (ω − V0 + k02 )Pn−1 + 2(ω − V0 )Qn−1 ,
Qn = (ω − V0 + k02 )Qn−1 + 2k02 Pn−1 .
˜ n } represent the dual operators in physical space of {Pn , Qn }
We let {P˜n , Q
in frequency domain. Then after transforming Eqs. (6) and (7) back to the
physical space by using the dual relation and using Eq. (4), we obtain high
order approximations to the TBC: for (2n + 1)-st order ABC by the (n, n)-Pad´e

Denote the approximation of ψ on the grid point (xj , tn ) by ψjn for 0 ≤ j ≤ J,
with xj = x0 + jΔx and tn = nΔt. In the interior domain, the Schr¨

where D+ and D− represent the forward and backward diﬀerences, respectively.
3.2

Order Reduction for Time Derivatives of Boundary Conditions

In order to numerically discrete the boundary conditions with high order derivatives, it is necessary to reduce the time derivatives to ﬁrst order. Thus, a twolayer scheme can be easily performed. For this, we use the original equation
iψt = −ψxx + V0 ψ to substitute ∂t with terms ψxx and ψ. For example, for the
(n, n)-Pad´e approximations, the boundary condition B3 ψ = 0 is of the ﬁrst order
with respect to t when n = 1. And when n > 1, we can write the operators P˜n
˜ n as
and Q
˜ n−1 ,
P˜n = (−∂xx + k02 )P˜n−1 − 2∂xx Q

˜ n = (−∂xx + k02 )Q
˜ n−1 + 2k02 P˜n−1 . (13)
Q

The boundary condition B2n+1 ψ = 0 then keeps ﬁrst order with respect to
t. Therefore, the midpoint rule can be easily achieved as a time discretization
method.
3.3

Approximation of Spectral Collocation Layers

We now concentrate on the discretizations of boundary conditions, in which we
shall use a technique of the spectral collocation method (for the theory and application of spectral methods, see monographs [22,23] for details). The collocation
points are distributed on the cell near the artiﬁcial boundary; i.e., on [x0 , x1 ] at
the left boundary and [xJ−1 , xJ ] at the right. We consider the right boundary
again. The approximation of diﬀerence scheme (12) at xJ−1 can be regarded as
a boundary condition of the right collocation domain, and thus the collocation
domain is well-posed together with the ABC (8) or (11) at xJ .

Spectral Collocation Technique for Absorbing Boundary Conditions

271

To introduce the spectral collocation method, we transform the domain
[xJ−1 , xJ ] into [−1, 1] by using scaling
ξ = s[x − (xJ + xJ−1 )/2], with s = 2/(xJ − xJ−1 ).

(14)

Eq. (2) near the boundary is then written as
˜ t),
iψ˜t (ξ, t) = −s2 ψ˜ξξ (ξ, t) + V0 ψ(ξ,

(15)

˜ t) = ψ(x, t). Similarly, the derivatives in the recursive formulae of
where ψ(ξ,
ABCs can be scaled. Let Tm (ξ) = cos(m arccos(ξ)) for 0 ≤ m ≤ M be the
Chebyshev polynomials, and ξm = cos(mπ/M ) be the Chebyshev-Gauss-Labatto
collocation points. The Chebyshev interpolating polynomial in space with M
collocation points reads

Using the above approximations in space and the midpoint rule in time, the equation in the collocation layer can be expressed as a system of algebraic equations
which is connected with scheme (12) in the interior domain at x = xJ−1 . The
formed algebraic system is a modiﬁed triangular linear matrix which contains
two blocks in the upper left and lower right corners.

Numerical Examples

In this section, we shall give some numerical examples for the Schr¨odinger equation (2) in homogeneous media; i.e., we set V ≡ 0.

Example 1. In the ﬁrst example, we are going to consider the evolvement of
2
the right travelling Gaussian beam ψ(x, 0) = e−x eiqx with q = 5 in a truncated
region [−10, 10]. Similar tests can be found in[12] and in[24], which simulated
optical beam propagation in the Fresnel approximation. By taking the parameter
k0 = q and 2q respectively in the calculations, we compute the solution up

to T = 10, and calculate the reﬂection ratio r =
j=0 |ψj | /
j=0 |ψj | at

time t = T . In Tables 1 and 2, we show the results of the reﬂection ratios
for diﬀerent boundary conditions with increasing high order approximation for
(n, n)-Pad´e and (n + 1, n)-Pad´e polynomials, respectively. We see that a higher
order boundary condition has usually a better eﬀect of absorbing outgoing waves.
The instability of the numerical solution also increases with the order of the
ABCs. For the eighth and ninth order ABCs, blowups appear; and the behavior
is worse, the smaller grid size is. However, these results are reasonable due to the
weak ill-posedness of the high order ABCs which induce ill-conditioned matrices.
Therefore, a better solver is desired to the linear systems.

in a truncated region [−10, 10], which is composed of waves with diﬀerent group
velocities. We compute the solution up to T = 2. The parameter k0 in the boundary
conditions is now a function of time; we take a linear function k0 (t) = (11 − t)/2,
because at time t the components with ±k0 (t) wavenumbers arrive at the boundaries. In the calculations, we take M = 13, Δx = 0.05 and Δt = 0.005. The

273

numerical solution with the same mesh sizes in a large domain [−40, 40] is taken
to be a reference “exact” solution, since the analytic solution is unknown. The numerical solutions for ABCs up to seventh order are illustrated in Fig. 1. It is a good
example to show why high-order ABCs are required. We see from the curves that
lower-order ABCs reﬂect many outgoing waves which pollute the solution in the
computational domain, and that higher-order ABCs demonstrate better results.

Concluding Remarks

High-order absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) for the linear Schr¨
odinger
equation are implemented through using a spectral collocation technique. Numerical results illustrate the attractive performance of higher-order cases. However, the instability appears with the increase of the order, which motivates
further investigation on the improvement of the approach. The method is outlined for one-dimensional problem but the extensions to multidimensional cases
of the technique are straightforward in Cartesian grids. Even so, a detailed report
for multidimensional problems is also necessary, which is under consideration as
a possible part of the future research.
