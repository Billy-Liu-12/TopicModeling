Abstract. Let X = (V, E) be a simple connected graph, the connectivity κ(X) of X is the minimum cardinality of all vertex cut sets in X. Let
x ∈ V (X), the set {xg : g ∈ Aut(X)} is called an orbit of Aut(X), the
automorphism group of X. In this note, we prove that the connectivity of
a connected bipartite graph with two orbits attains its minimum degree.

Introduction

Let X=(V, E) be a simple connected graph, with V (X) the set of vertices and
E(X) the set of edges. A vertex cut of X is a subset U of V such that the subgraph X\U induced by V \U is either trivial or not connected. The connectivity
κ(X) of a nontrivial connected graph X is the minimum cardinality of all vertex
cut sets of X. If we denote by δ(X) the minimum degree of X, then κ(X)≤δ(X).
We denote by Aut(X) the automorphism group of X. The graph X is said to
be vertex transitive if for any two distinct vertices of X there is an automorphism
mapping one to the other. Let x ∈ V (X), we call the set {xg : g ∈ Aut(X)} an
orbit of Aut(X). Clearly, Aut(X) acts transitively on each orbit of Aut(X).
In [3], Mader proved that the connectivity of a connected vertex transitive
graph, which is K4 −f ree, attains its minimum degree. It arouses us to consider
the relation between the connectivity and the number of orbits. In this note,
we prove that the connectivity of a connected bipartite graph with two orbits
attains its minimum degree.
In the next, we introduce some terms and theorems which will be used in
proving our main results.
Let X = (V, E) be a connected graph and F be a non-empty subset of
V (G). Set N (F ) = {x∈V (X)\F : ∃y∈F, st. xy∈E(X)}, C(F ) = F ∪ N (F )
and R(F ) = V (X) \ C(F ). Clearly, N (F ) is a vertex cut set if R(F )=∅. A subset
F ⊂V (X) is said to be a fragment if |N (F )|=κ(X) and R(F )=∅. A fragment of
minimum cardinality is called an atom of X. An imprimitive block for a group

U of permutations on a set T is a proper, nontrivial subset A of T such that if
σ ∈ U then either σ(A) = A or σ(A) ∩ A = ∅. A subset A of V (X) is called an
imprimitive block for X if it is an imprimitive block for Aut(X) on V (X).
Theorem 1. [8] Let X=(V, E) be a nontrivial connected graph which is not a
complete graph.
(i) κ(X) = δ(X) if and only if every atom of X has cardinality 1;
(ii) if κ(X) < δ(X), then each atom has cardinality at most [(|V | − κ(X))/2]
and induces a connected subgraph of X.
Theorem 2. [5] If X=(V, E) is a nontrivial connected graph which is not a
complete graph, then distinct atoms of X are disjoint. Thus if κ(X) < δ(X), the
atoms of X are imprimitive blocks of X.
Theorem 3. [5] Let X=(V, E) be a nontrivial connected graph. If W is a minimum vertex cut set and A an atom of X, then A ∩ W = ∅ or A⊆W .

Main Results

Let X=(V, E) be a connected bipartite graph with two orbits. Clearly, it is semiregular. In this section, we use X0 and X1 to denote the two orbits of Aut(X).
Without loss of generality, we may assume that m = d(u) for any u ∈ X0 ,
n = d(v) for any v ∈ X1 , and m ≤ n. So we have δ(X) = m. Let A be an atom
of X. Set A0 = A ∩ X0 and A1 = A ∩ X1 , then A = A0 ∪ A1 .
Lemma 1. Let X=(V, E) be a connected bipartite graph with two orbits, and A
be an atom of X. If κ(X) < δ(X), then Ai =A ∩ Xi (i = 0, 1) are nontrivial.
Proof. By Theorem 1, the induced subgraph Y =X[A] is a nontrivial connected
subgraph of X, which is a bipartite graph, thus Ai =A ∩ Xi = ∅(i = 0, 1). Suppose that one of these two vertex subsets is trivial.
Case 1: |A0 |=1. Thus, |A1 |≤m since Y is connected. Set F = N (A).
Subcase 1.1: |A1 |=m. So we have |F |≥n − 1. If |F |=n − 1, then the induced
subgraph Y =X[A∪F ] is a connected component of X, which is impossible since
X is connected. Thus |F |>n − 1, namely |F |≥n≥m = δ(X), a contradiction.
Subcase 1.2: |A1 |=p≤m − 1. Thus |N (A0 )\A1 |=m − p. Let q=|N (A1 )\A0 |, we
have q ≥ n − 1. Since
|F | = |N (A)| = |N (A0 ) \ A1 | + |N (A1 ) \ A0 | = m − p + q ≥ m + n − p − 1
and |F | = κ(X) < m, we have n < p + 1 ≤ m, a contradiction.
Case 2: |A1 |=1. Thus, |A0 |≤n since Y is connected. Set F = N (A).

Subcase 2.1: |A0 |=n. So we have |F |≥m − 1. Since |F |=κ(X) < m, |F |≤m − 1.
Namely, |F | = m − 1. Thus we have that the induced subgraph Y =X[A ∪ F ] is
a connected component of X, a contradiction.
Subcase 1.2: |A0 |=p≤n − 1. Thus |N (A0 )\A1 |=n − p. Let q=|N (A1 )\A0 |, then
q ≥ m − 1. Since
|F | = |N (A)| = |N (A0 ) \ A1 | + |N (A1 ) \ A0 | = n − p + q ≥ n + m − p − 1
and |F | = κ(X) < m, we have n < p + 1 ≤ n, a contradiction.
The result follows.
Lemma 2. Let X=(V, E) be a connected bipartite graph with two orbits, and A
be an atom of X, and Y =X[A]. If κ(X) < δ(X), then Aut(Y ) acts transitively
on Ai = A ∩ Xi (i = 0, 1).
Proof. By Lemma 1, Ai =A ∩ Xi (i=0, 1) are nontrivial. For any u, v∈A0 , there
exists an automorphism ϕ of X with ϕ(u) = v and so ϕ(A) ∩ A = ∅. By Theorem 2, ϕ(A) = A. Since A0 and A1 are contained in diﬀerent orbits, we have
ϕ(A0 ) = A0 and ϕ(A1 ) = A1 . Thus the restriction of ϕ on A induces an automorphism of Y , and then Aut(Y ) acts transitively on A0 . Similarly, Aut(Y ) acts
transitively on A1 . The result follows.
Lemma 3. Let X=(V, E) be a connected bipartite graph with two orbits, and A
be an atom of X. If κ(X) < δ(X), then
(i) Every vertex of X lies in an atom;
(ii) |A| ≤ κ(X).
Proof. (i) By Lemma 1, the induced subgraph Y =X[A] is a nontrivial connected
subgraph of X, thus at least one vertex of Xi (i = 0, 1), respectively, lies in an
atom. By the transitivity of Xi , every vertex of X lies in an atom.
(ii) Let F =N (A). By (i), for any u ∈ F , u lies in an atom A of X. By
Theorem 3, A ⊆F , then |A| = |A | ≤ |F | = κ(X).
Theorem 4. If X=(V, E) is a connected bipartite graph with two orbits, then
κ(X) = δ(X).
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that κ(X) < δ(X). By Theorem 1 and Lemma 3,
V (X) is a disjoint union of distinct atoms. Let A be an atom of X, then there
exist σi ∈ Aut(X)(i = 1, · · · , k), such that
k

V (X) =

σi (A) .

i=1

By Lemma 1, the induced subgraph Y =X[A] is a nontrivial connected subgraph
of X, and Ai =A∩Xi (i = 0, 1) are nontrivial. Since Aut(X) has two orbits X0 , X1 ,
for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k and i = j, σi (A0 ) ∩ σj (A0 ) = ∅ and σi (A0 ), σj (A0 ) ⊆ X0 .

Thus, we have X0 = ki=1 σi (A0 ), X1 = ki=1 σi (A1 ), and |Ai |||Xi |(i = 0, 1).
Since |X0 |/|X1 | = n/m, we have |A0 |/|A1 | = n/m.
By Lemma 2, the induced subgraph Y is semi-regular. Let d = δ(Y ) = δA0
and F = N (A), we have δA1 = nd/m. Since every vertex of A0 has m − d
neighbours in F and every vertex of A1 has n − nd/m neighbours in F , we have
|F | = κ(X) ≥ m − d + n − nd/m = m + n − (m + n)d/m. By κ(X) < δ(X) = m,
we have d > mn/(m + n). Thus, |A| = |A0 | + |A1 | ≥ d + nd/m = (m + n)d/m >
n ≥ m > κ(X). By Lemma 3, we deduce a contradiction.
The theorem then follows.
