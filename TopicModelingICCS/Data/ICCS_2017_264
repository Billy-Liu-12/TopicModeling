flow rate pumps. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop a reliable method for monitoring of fractures
propagation in reservoir rock. Such methods would prevent from fracturing outside the perspective
region, which leads to unnecessary costs and may lead to ground water pollution (Arthur et al., 2008;
Osborn, Vengosh, Warner, & Jackson, 2011). One of the methods, providing deep insight into fracturing
process is microseismic monitoring (Calvez et al., 2007). It utilizes an array of seismic sensors
(geophones/hydrophones) that record ground vibrations induced by fractured rock formations. The
sensors can be placed in a nearby wellbore or on the surface (Eisner et al., 2010). The signals are
recorded during and after hydraulic fracturing process. The recorded data is processed for seismic event
detection and localization.
The most basic procedure for seismic signal interpretation requires manual picking of wave arrivals
on individual recordings. After precise measurement of wave arrival times, one can use Geiger’s method
to locate events (Geiger, 1912). To account for sensor measurement uncertainty, probabilistic methods
might be used (Lomax, Virieux, & Volant, 2000). When one uses multiple recorders, uncertainty of
location, caused by first arrival picks errors and inaccurate velocity model, can be reduced by methods
based on signals cross-correlation, double differencing or joint hypocenter determination (Frohlich,
1979; Waldhauser & Ellsworth, 2000).
For automatic and real time applications, seismic signal should by picked in individual traces by
appropriate algorithm. One of the most basic solution to that is usage of STA/LTA (Short Time
Average/Long Time Average). It consists of computing ratio of short time signal average to long time
signal average and applying threshold (Allen, 1978). Different approaches utilize envelope function
(Baer & Kradolfer, 1987),detection of abrupt changes in signal parameters e.g. (Coppens, 1985;
Sabbione & Velis, 2010) and wavelets (Rodriguez, 2011).
Microseismic events are usually orders of magnitude weaker than earthquakes that destroy buildings
(Falborski & Jankowski, 2013; Jankowski, 2015; Jankowski & Mahmoud, 2015, 2016; Naderpour,
Barros, Khatami, & Jankowski, 2016). Additionally gas perspective shale formation in Poland is located
at the depth of about 4 km and overlaid with highly attenuating layers. This renders huge problems in
distinguishing seismic signal from noise on a single record as usually signal to noise ratio is smaller
than 1.
Such circumstances call for undertaking special numerical approach that would benefit from signal
coherence. Those algorithms are mostly based on Kirchoff migration (Baker, Granat, & Clayton, 2005;
Gray & May, 1994). The principle of operation of such algorithms is based on stacking of records from
multiple receivers. Before stacking, wave travel times from discretized underground to each receiver
are computed. This allows for appropriate time-shifting of signals before stacking.
For the data acquired during microseismic monitoring in Poland, diffraction stacking algorithm was
used (J. Gajewski, Anikiev, Kashtan, Tessmer, & Vanelle, 2007). The principles of this computer
procedure are described further in this paper.

2 Wellbore Location and Monitoring Configuration
Pomerania region in Poland was the region of operation. Horizontal part of the wellbore is at the
depth of about 4km. It is drilled through Ordovician strata. It is overlaid with formation problematic
from the seismic point of view, i.e. Cenozoic strata with very low wave propagation speeds and high
attenuation and anhydrites sand salts which distort and refract seismic signal.
12 thousand geophones were used for the research. Each 12 geophones were connected to one
recording line, so that the signals from them were added and recorded as one channel. 25 of such
channels were arranged in a 5 by 5 array to form a patch (see Figure 1). Each patch was distributed over
the area of 90x95m. 40 of such patches were distributed within 4km radius from the projection of
horizontal part of the wellbore. Organizing geophones into channels and channels into patches helps to
mitigate surface noise. The locations of the patches were chosen based on the near surface layer

1723

thickness and attenuation factor, avoiding noisy places such as roads, populated places and surrounding
of the drilling pad.
There were 11 stages of fracturing in total. Each stage consisted of 6 explosive perforations and a
few hours of pumping.
The geophones had a corner frequency of 10Hz. Sampling frequency was set to 500Hz. All channels
were constantly recorded during the period of 10 days.

Figure 1: Arrangement of geophones and channels in single patch

3 Signal Analysis Procedure
In the first step, the noise analysis is performed. That was done by computing Root Mean Square
(RMS) of signal during different periods of weekdays and on the weekends. Patches with the highest
level of noise were not used in the analysis. Signals were filtered with Butterworth bandpass filter from
20 to 40Hz (higher frequencies are strongly attenuated on the way from the event source and therefore
are mostly related to noise).
Next step was related to the velocity model building. For the precise seismic location, one needs a
good velocity model, ideally obtained by 3D seismic method. In the case of our research, we only had
1D velocity profile obtained by seismic well logging. Velocity profile relates pressure wave velocity to
depth. As the log lacked the data for near surface and for depth higher than 3700m, it was linearly
extrapolated in both directions.
Next the subsurface was discretized with model grid step 25m. The size of discretized subsurface
was 321x281x209 nodes. From those nodes, a subvolume was chosen, in which events are expected
(around horizontal part of the wellbore). The size of this subvolume was 101x101x53 nodes (image
points). Having velocity profile and spatial location of each receiver, pressure wave travel times were
computed from each discrete underground location in the subvolume to each receiver.
Then, for each discrete source location in the subvolue (image point), records from all receivers were
shifted in time accordingly to travel times computed in previous step and stacked (eq. 1)

where S is the computed stack value for the image point (x,y,z) and origin time t, A is the recorded
seismogram, 𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅 (𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦, 𝑧𝑧) is the computed P-wave travel time from the source point (x,y,z) to the receiver
R on the surface. For a fixed origin time t, we call this function: image function.
In the simplest case, one can add shifted signals. Some researcher suggest stacking of signal absolute
values to prevent canceling out of signals with different phase, as in SSA algorithm (Kao & Shan, 2004).
Others use signal envelopes stacking (Gharti, Oye, Roth, & Kü hn, 2010), semblance stacking (Neidell
& Taner, 1971) or STALTA stacking (Grigoli, Cesca, Vassallo, & Dahm, 2013).
The stack was created for every possible source point from discretized subsurface. For each time
step t, a maximum stack value over x,y and z were found. Maximum stack was searched for events by
STA/LTA algorithm with defined threshold to find event origin time, t*. When event was detected in
time, the image function for all considered source points was computed by taking absolute value of the
function from eq. 1 with t=t*. The event location has coordinates (x*,y*,z*) for which image function
reaches its maximum value.
To further improve localization of seismic events one needs to calibrate wave velocity model. In
order to do that, an event with a known location and large magnitude is needed. For this purpose
explosive perforation was chosen, that could be easily distinguished on most of the records. The event
corresponding to perforation was detected 1.15 deeper then it occurred. After multiplying velocity
profile by 1.15, the event was detected at the right depth. More information on that algorithm can be
found in (Anikiev, Valenta, Staněk, & Eisner, 2014; O. Zhebel & Eisner, 2012; Oksana Zhebel & Eisner,
2015)

4 Implementation
The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB. The stacking procedure is computationally intensive,
as it requires adding 1000 records separately for every image point (540653 nodes). Therefore the
stacking procedure was run in parallel on a computer cluster using 12-core Intel® Xeon® E5 processors.
The algorithm scales well with the number of used cores. Computation of stack for one minute rocord
(30k samples x 1000 channels) for one image point with usage of one core takes about 0.23 s. Therefore
algorithm can be run in real-time by 2100 cores.

5 Results
Full seismic processing was applied only to time sections, in which downhole seismic array detected
events with the highest magnitude. Calibration of the velocity model was performed with utilization of
perforation shots that were recorded during periods of low noise.
The numerical results of the stacking procedure are shown in Figure 2 for an event with relatively
high magnitude. First plot shows maximal value of the stack function over all image points, second plot
is a result of STA/LTA filtering of the above signal and the last one shows the corresponding semblance
value. Figure 3 shows image function of detected event for time, which had the highest maximum stack
value. A probability density function of event location was estimated from image function (Figure 4).
6 events were detected in total from the surface array monitoring. Comparison of locations of events
from downhole and surface monitoring can be seen in Figure 6 and 7.

6 Conclusions
In total, 8 events were detected by using the computer algorithm with data obtained from the surface
array. 6 detected events has strong correlation with downhole (according to origin times). Comparison
of locations shows highest misfit in horizontal direction of around 200 m and 800 m in vertical direction.
Horizontal misfit for the strongest event is less than 10m.
The results show that the numerical procedure applied in the study can be an efficient tool in
determination of the events. Moreover, surface microseismic has been found to have some potential in
Polish geological conditions although the signal to noise ratio was too high to detect reasonable number
of events. Also events locations are quite disturbed. Probably using higher number of patches and 3D
seismic velocity model would facilitate detection and localization.
