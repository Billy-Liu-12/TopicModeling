Abstract. Let A = A∗ ∈ Mn and L = {(Uk , λk )| Uk ∈ C , ||Uk || =

paper we develop a modified Newton method that converges to a point

Introduction

We denote by Mn the space of n-by-n complex matrices. We denote by σ(A) the
set of eigenvalues of A ∈ Mn . Let A ∈ Mn be Hermitian. Then there is a unitary

We assume that the eigenvalues λk of A are arranged in decreasing order,
i.e., λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λn [3, chapter 4].

It is well known that the newton’s method has a local quadratic convergence rate
[2], that is there is a small neighborhood N∈k for each eigenpair

We call N∈k the quadratic convergence neighborhood of the eigenpair
.
λk
Although the speciﬁc determination of each N∈k is an extremely diﬃcult task,
if the method converges to a point in L then we know the rate of convergence
will eventually be quadratic. It can be shown easily that the newton’s method
is not global. We provide an example:

Thus if goes to zero, the iteration diverges. Similarly, for the initial eigenpair

. We modify the newton method in order to have a global convergence.

There are several considerations to give for the modiﬁcation. First, under the

modiﬁcation we desire the pair

of the iteration, i.e., dL
≤ dL
where dL is a suitable
(i+1)
α
α(i)
distance measure from a point to L. It will ensure the points under the iteration
remain in D. Second, we want to modify the method the least amount as possible
in order to preserve the original properties of the newton’s Method, for example,
local quadratic convergence. Third, the modiﬁed method should be simple to
implement, requires almost the same procedures as the original newton iteration.
