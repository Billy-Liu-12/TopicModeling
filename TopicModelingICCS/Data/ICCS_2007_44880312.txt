Abstract. The Sparkle/PM3 model is extended to cerium(III) complexes. The
validation procedure was carried out using only high quality crystallographic
structures (R factor < 0.05Å), for a total of thirty-seven Ce(III) complexes. The
Sparkle/PM3 unsigned mean error, for all interatomic distances between the
Ce(III) ion and the directly coordinating oxygen or nitrogen atoms, is 0.080Å, a
level of accuracy equivalent to the Sparkle/AM1 figure of 0.083Å. Moreover,
their accuracy is similar to what can be obtained by present-day ab initio
effective core potential full geometry optimization calculations on such
lanthanide complexes.
Keywords: Cerium, Sparkle Model, PM3, Lanthanide.

1 Introduction
The motivation for research on Ce(III) has been mainly focused on developing
materials for phosphor and scintillator applications [1].
Recently, we introduced Sparkle/AM1 [2], a new paradigm for semiempirical
quantum chemical calculations on lanthanide complexes. Sparkle/AM1 lanthanides
function as new elements to the semiempirical quantum chemistry molecular orbital
model AM1 [3]. That is, when a lanthanide complex is calculated, the lanthanide is
represented by a sparkle, whereas the ligands are modeled by AM1.
The Sparkle model assumes that the angular effects of the f orbitals are negligible,
and do not take them into account. The sparkle model replaces the lanthanide(III) ion
by a Coulombic charge of +3e superimposed to a repulsive exponential potential of
the form exp(-αr), which accounts for the size of the ion; provides three electrons to
the orbitals of the ligands; adds two Gaussian functions to the core-core repulsion
energy term; and includes the lanthanide atomic mass. Thus, the sparkle model
assumes that the lanthanide trications behave like simple ions, without any angular
steric properties.
Indeed, Sparkle/AM1 was mainly designed to predict geometries of lanthanide
complexes at a level of accuracy useful for complex design. Recent research on
lanthanide complexes has in fact indicated that Sparkle/AM1 coordination polyhedron
geometries are comparable to, if not better than geometries obtained from the best
contemporary ab-initio full geometry optimization calculations with effective core

potentials [4]. Besides, Sparkle/AM1 calculations are hundreds of times faster [2],
and have been recently employed for the study of quantum yields of luminescence for
some complexes [5]-[9].
PM3 [10],[11] was introduced in 1989 as a more accurate semiempirical model,
giving lower average errors than AM1 [3], mainly for the enthalpies of formation.
PM3 also became very popular [12]. More recently, Stewart completed the
parameterization of PM3 to all non-radioactive elements of the main group, excluding
the noble gases, thus largely amplifying its usefulness [13].
In order to broaden the range of applications of our sparkle model, we advance, in
the present article, Sparkle/PM3 parameters for the calculation of Ce(III) complexes
to complement the Sparkle/AM1 parameters that have already been published for
Ce(III) ion [14].

2 Parameterization Procedure
The parameterization procedure used for Ce(III) was essentially the same as the one
described in our previous work on Sparkle/AM1 for Ce(III)[14]. Accordingly, we
only used high quality crystallographic structures (R-factor < 5%) taken from the
"Cambridge Structural Database 2003" (CSD) [15]-[17], having found a total of 37
structures of complexes of Ce(III). As training sets, we used the same three subsets of
15 complexes each, already chosen for the parameterization of Sparkle/AM1 for the
same ions[14].
The Sparkle/PM3 parameters found for the cerium (III) ion are shown in Table 1.

The heat of formation of the Ce(III) ion in Sparkle/PM3 was obtained by adding to
the heat of atomization of cerium, its first three ionization potentials.

3 Results and Discussion
As geometry accuracy measures, we used the average unsigned mean error for each
complex i, UMEi, defined as:

where ni is the number of ligand atoms directly coordinating the lanthanide ion. Two
cases have been examined: (i) UME(Ln-L)s involving the interatomic distances Rj
between the lanthanide central ion, Ln, and the atoms of the coordination polyhedron,
L, important to complex design; and (ii) UMEs of all the edges of the pyramids, that
is, of the interatomic distances Rj between the lanthanide central ion and the atoms of
the coordination polyhedron, as well as all the interatomic distances Rj between all
atoms of the coordination polyhedron. Table S1 of the supplementary material
presents the UME(Ce-L)s and UMEs for both Sparkle/PM3 and Sparkle/AM1 for thirtyseven cerium (III) complexes.
Table 2 presents unsigned mean errors for both Sparkle/PM3 and Sparkle/AM1 for
various types of distances in the Ce(III) complexes considered. Results indicate that
the two models are essentially equivalent. Distances between the cerium (III) ion and
its directly coordinated ligand atoms are predicted with higher accuracy than either
the distances between two Ce(III) ions in dilanthanide compounds, or the distances
between atoms of the faces of the coordination polyhedron. Luckily that is so, because
radial lanthanide ion-ligand atom distances are far more important for luminescent
complex design [18].

Assuming that the sparkle model is a good representation of the lanthanide ion, as
well as of its interactions with the ligands, the distribution of these UMEs should be
random around a mean, whose value can be used as a measure of accuracy of the
model. Since the UMEs are positive, defined in the domain (0,∞), they should follow
the gamma distribution which has the probability density function g(x; k, θ), where
x > 0 stands for the UMEs, k > 0 is the shape parameter, and θ > 0 is the scale
parameter of the gamma distribution. The expected value of the gamma distribution is
simply kθ. The shape and scale parameters were estimated with the method of
maximum likelihood in order to obtain the gamma distribution fit of the UME data.
The quality of the gamma distribution fit can be assessed via the one-sample nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov [19] test. For the hypothesis that the UME values
follow a gamma distribution not to be rejected at the usual level of 5%, the p-value of
the test statistic must thus be larger than 0.05.

Figure 1 presents a gamma distribution fit of the UME(Ce-L)s for Sparkle/PM3.
Superimposed to the fit, a histogram of the data with the number of bars chosen to
best adjust the histogram to the curve obtained from the gamma distribution fit is also
presented so that the reader can check the regions where the actual UMEs really
occurred. The p-value of the gamma distribution fit for Sparkle/PM3 is 0.062, above
the 0.05 value, thus attaching statistical significance to the fit and, by extension, to the
Ce(III) Sparkle/PM3 model as well.

Recently, an exhaustive study by our research group has been accomplished on
coordination polyhedron geometry prediction accuracies of ab initio effective core
potential (ab initio/ECP) calculations [4]. The study consisted of complete full
geometry optimization calculations on dozens of complexes of various lanthanide
ions, the largest containing 164 atoms, varying both basis sets (STO-3G, 3-21G, 631G, 6-31G*, and 6-31+G) and method (HF, B3LYP, and MP2 full). The notable
conclusion was that RHF/STO-3G/ECP appears to be the most efficient model
chemistry in terms of coordination polyhedron crystallographic geometry predictions
from isolated lanthanide complex ion calculations. Contrary to what would normally
be expected, either an increase in the basis set or inclusion of electron correlation, or
both, consistently enlarged the deviations and aggravated the quality of the predicted
coordination polyhedron geometries.

For Ce(III) we chose six of these complexes to have their geometries fully
optimized with the model chemistry RHF/STO-3G/ECP. The chosen complexes were
selected to be representative of the various classes of ligands (β-diketones, nitrates,
monodentates, bidentates, tridentates, and polydentates) present in the validation set
(see Fig. S2 in supplementary material).
Figure 2 and 3 presents the average UME(Ce-L) and UME values for Sparkle/PM3,
Sparkle/AM1 and RHF/STO-3G/ECP full geometry optimizations of the six
complexes considered. Clearly, all three model chemistries are comparable, with
Sparkle/PM3 being in average slightly superior to Sparkle/AM1, which is, in turn,
superior to RHF/STO-3G/ECP for the prediction of the geometries of the whole
coordination polyhedra.

4 Conclusion
The most accurate ab initio effective core potential full geometry optimization
calculations that can be nowadays carried out on cerium (III) complexes, of a size
large enough to be of relevance to present-day research, exhibit the same accuracy of
either Sparkle/PM3 or Sparkle/AM1 models. Our results do indicate that the Sparkle
model is seemingly an accurate and statistically valid tool for the prediction of
coordination polyhedra of lanthanide complexes.
More importantly, the ability to perform a screening on many different putative
structures of lanthanide complexes in a combinatorial manner, made possible by both
Sparkle/PM3 and Sparkle/AM1, may prove to be of importance for complexes design
research.
