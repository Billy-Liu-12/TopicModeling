Abstract. In this paper, the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is
extended to the case where each vehicle is restricted to an additional
minimal starting or returning load constraint. We refer to this extension
as the Minimal Load Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem. We present
integer programming formulations for single and multidepot cases. An
illustrative example is also provided to show how a decision maker can
use the proposed formulation as an aid in distribution planning.

Introduction

In this paper, we deal with the well-known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
(CVRP), which ﬁnds many practical applications in the ﬁeld of distribution
and logistics. The problem is formally deﬁned on a graph G = (V, A) where
V = {0, 1, 2, ..., n} is the set of nodes (vertices), node 0 is the depot and the
remaining nodes are customers. The set A = {(i, j) : i, j ∈ V, i = j} is an arc
(or edge) set. With each customer i ∈ V \ {0} is associated a positive integer
demand qi and with each arc (i, j) is associated a travel cost cij (which may be
symmetric, asymmetric, Euclidean, deterministic, random, etc.). There are m
vehicles with identical capacity Q. The classical CVRP consists of determining
a set of m vehicle routes satisfying the following conditions simultaneously:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

Each route starts and ends at the depot,
Each customer belongs to exactly one route,
The total demand of each route does not exceed the vehicle capacity Q,
The total cost of all routes (m routes) is minimized.

The CVRP has been studied extensively in the literature (for recent publications, see Achuthan et al. [1], Toth and Vigo [2], Ralphs [3]). Most of the
existing literature on CVRPs deals with the minimization of the total distance
(or time or cost) of the tours, as formulated 45 years ago by Dantzig and Ramser
[4]. This deﬁnition, although very general, is not suﬃcient to adequately model
situations where the loads of the vehicles are of importance. It is obvious that
the cost of a vehicle’s tour depends not only on the distance travelled but also on
the amount of goods carried. In addition, balancing of the loads is also a concern

for the distribution design. For instance, vehicle loads may also be important for
drivers, i.e. they may be required to carry similar amounts of goods. Along this
line of research, few studies exist that have attempted to extend the deﬁnition
of the CVRP so as to balance the length of the tours (Jozefowiez et al. [5]) or
workload among employees (Lee and Ueng [6]) in addition to minimizing the
total distance.
Clearly, the amount of goods carried by a vehicle is directly proportional
to the starting or returning loads. Thus, the starting load of a vehicle in the
case of delivery, and the returning (ﬁnal) load of a vehicle in the case of collection may be as important as the capacity of the vehicles. As far as the
authors are aware, there exist no formulations imposing minimal starting or
returning loads for vehicles. Such a restriction frequently arises in real life applications when distribution of loads across vehicles is important. Thus, there is
a need to expand the traditional deﬁnition of the problem to be in compliance
with practical situations. This is the main motivation and contribution of this
study.
This paper extends the CVRP to include additional load constraints, i.e. it
imposes a minimal starting load in the case of delivery or a minimal returning
load in the case of collection, and proposes integer linear programming formulations (ILPFs). In section 2, we deﬁne and present ILPFs for the CVRP and
the Minimal Load Constrained VRP with a single depot. Then, an extension
to the nonﬁxed multidepot case is given in section 3. We provide an illustrative
example in section 4, showing how the proposed model can be used as an aid in
routing decisions. The paper concludes with some suggestions in section 5.

Vehicle Routing Problems with Minimal Load
Constraints

The ﬁrst linear programming formulation of the CVRP is due to Dantzig and
Ramser [4], in which the authors solved problems having up to 13 nodes (including the depot) by the aid of a heuristic. The ﬁrst practical solution method
was proposed by Clarke and Wright [7]. An integer linear programming formulation of the CVRP with three-index variables was presented by Golden et al.
[8]. Subsequent research has mainly focused on two-index variable formulations.
We also follow two-index formulations here. Several ILPFs for the CVRP with
two-index variables have been proposed in the literature. The ﬁrst group is based
on Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson’s [9] subtour elimination constraints of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (see e.g. [1], [10], [2]). The number of inequalities of these types of constraints grows exponentially with the number of
nodes. Thus models including such constraints cannot be solved directly by any
optimizer. A two-index ILPF for the CVRP with polynomial size was given by
Kulkarni and Bhave [11], which was based on Miller-Tucker-Zemlin [12] subtour
elimination constraints. Later, Desrochers and Laporte [13] proposed lifted subtour elimination constraints. Recently, Kara et al. [14] suggested a correction for
both of these papers and provided a corrected ILPF of the CVRP.

We now formally deﬁne the minimal load constrained VRP. Let the following
side condition also be imposed on the CVRP in addition to (i)-(iv):
(v) In the case of delivery, the starting load of each vehicle (or in the case of
collection, the returning load of each vehicle) cannot be less than a predetermined value.
We refer to the VRP with constraints (i)-(v) as the Minimal Load Constrained
VRP (MLCVRP). To construct the ILPF of MLCVRP, we further deﬁne the
following:
– cij , Q, and qi are as deﬁned previously
– Q0 is the minimal starting load (delivery) or the minimal returning load
(pick up) of each vehicle
– xij = 1 if the arc (i, j) is on the optimal tour and 0 otherwise
– ui is the load of a vehicle (amount of goods collected) just after visiting
customer i, or is the amount of goods delivered (unloaded space of a vehicle)
just after visiting customer i
We now provide a general ILPF for the MLCVRP:
cij xij

(1)

x0i ≤ m

(2)

s.t.
i∈V \{0}

xij = 1,

ui ≥ 0,
xij ∈ {0, 1},

i ∈ V \ {0}
i, j ∈ V

(5)
(6)
(7)

where xij ’s are deﬁned for qi +qj ≤ Q, ∀(i, j) ∈ A. In this formulation, constraint
(2) is used to allow at most m vehicles, whereas (3)-(4) are the degree constraints.
Constraint (5) is a subtour elimination constraint (see [14]) ensuring the solution
contains no illegal subtours. Nonnegativity and integrality constraints are given
in (6) and (7).
In the following, we deﬁne valid inequalities for the MLCVRP that impose
capacity and minimal load constraints:
Proposition 1. Let q i = minj=i {qj }, Q ≥ Q0 and Q0 ≥ q i + qi , ∀i ∈ V \ {0}.
Then,

Minimal Load Constrained Vehicle Routing Problems

191

ui + (Q − q i − qi )x0i − q i xi0 ≤ Q − q i ,

i ∈ V \ {0}

(8)

ui + q i x0i + (qi + q i − Q0 )xi0 ≥ qi + q i ,
x0i + xi0 ≤ 1,

i ∈ V \ {0}
i ∈ V \ {0}

(9)
(10)

are valid inequalities for the MLCVRP, and are here referred to as bounding
constraints.
Proof. Constraints (5) ensure that if xij = 1, then uj = ui + qj . Since the
inequalities given in (10) do not allow single node visits, we consider three cases:
(i) If x0i = xi0 = 0, then this means that there exist two distinct nodes k =
l = i ≥ 1 such that xki = xil = 1 by the assignment constraints. In this case,
qi + qk ≤ ui ≤ Q − ql by (5). Since qk ≥ minj=i {qj } and ql ≥ minj=i {qj }, letting
q i = minj=i {qj }, this inequality can be written as qi + q i ≤ ui ≤ Q − q i . This
is exactly what constraints (8) and (9) imply when x0i = xi0 = 0. (ii) If x0i = 1
and xi0 = 0, (8) and (9) imply ui = qi . (iii) Finally, if x0i = 0 and xi0 = 1, then
Q0 ≤ ui ≤ Q.
The proposed model contains O(n2 ) binary variables and O(n2 ) constraints.
Thus, appropriate size real life problems can be solved to optimality by commercial codes. Such an opportunity will also allow us to conduct post-optimality
analysis. The following proposition shows that the proposed model can be used
for the classical CVRP as well.
Proposition 2. The constraints
ui + q i x0i ≥ qi + q i ,

i ∈ V \ {0}

(11)

together with constraints (8) are valid inequalities for the CVRP.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Proposition (1).
In the case of the classical CVRP, if single customer visits are allowed, then
constraints (10) can be dropped.

A Multidepot Case

In this section, we give a fairly straightforward extension of the proposed model
to the multidepot MLCVRP. The multidepot case is a generalization of the single
depot MLCVRP, so as to permit more than one depot and a number of vehicles
located at each depot. This problem has immediate applications in supply chain
management or distribution planning where such structures generally include
more than one facility (such as distribution centers or warehouses) and a set of
vehicles that have to be routed from these facilities.
To formally deﬁne the problem, let the node set be partitioned such that
V = D ∪ V , where the ﬁrst d nodes of V are depot set D, there are mi vehicles
located at depot i initially and the total number of vehicles is m. Also, let
V = {d + 1, d + 2, . . . , n} be the set of customers. The problem consists of

192

ﬁnding tours for all the vehicles such that all customers are visited exactly once,
the loads of each vehicle lie within a predetermined interval and the total cost
of all the tours is minimized. If the problem is to determine a total of m tours
such that each vehicle must return to its original depot, this is referred to as the
fixed destination case. On the other hand, if the vehicles do not have to return
to their original depot but the number of vehicles at each depot after all travel
is to be equal to the initial number, we have the nonfixed destination case. In
this paper, we consider the latter case.
We now provide the relevant ILPF:
cij xij

s.t.
xij ≤ mi ,

i∈D

(13)

xij ≤ mj ,

xij = 1,

i∈V

(16)

xik ≤ Q − q i ,

i∈V

(17)

xik ≥ qi + q i ,

xki + xik ≤ 1, k ∈ D, i ∈ V
ui − uj + Qxij + (Q − qi − qj )xji ≤ Q − qj , i = j, i, j ∈ V
ui ≥ 0,
i∈V
xij ∈ {0, 1},

i, j ∈ V

where the decision variables and parameters are as deﬁned previously. It is easily
seen that the subtour elimination constraints of both models (single and multidepot cases) are the same. A careful analysis of the constraints given in (17),
(18) and (19) shows that they play the same role as the bounding constraints in
the single depot case.

An Illustrative Example

In this section, we illustrate how the model proposed above can be used as a
decision aid by solving a problem taken from the famous paper of Dantzig and
Ramser [4]. The problem is to deliver gasoline to gas stations in such a way
that the total distance traveled by four identical trucks, each of which has 6000
unit capacity, is minimized. There are 12 customers (gas stations) denoted by

P1,..., P12, with P0 as the depot. The symmetric distance matrix and demand
of each customer can be found in the original paper [4]. Dantzig and Ramser
solved this problem by the aid of a heuristic that they developed, and found the
near-optimal solution shown in Table 1.
By using CPLEX 8.0 on a Pentium III computer running at 1400 Mhz, we
solved this problem ﬁrst without a lower bound, and then obtained alternative
solutions with various upper and lower bounds using the single depot model with
m = 4. Our ﬁndings are summarized in Table 2.
The solution of the problem given in Table 1 and the ﬁrst solution given in
Table 2 show that there are big variations in the starting loads and distances
of the trucks. However, when the decision maker imposes diﬀerent lower bounds
as well as upper bounds on the loads of each vehicle, the solutions change as
expected. More speciﬁcally, increasing the lower bound decreases the diﬀerence
between the starting loads of the vehicles. For instance, when a lower bound of
Q0 = 4500 is imposed on the original problem where Q = 6000, the loads of
the vehicles become very close to each other. The table also shows two other

solutions with Q0 = 3750, Q = 5000 and Q0 = 5250, Q = 7000. It is interesting
to see that the latter solution only requires 3 vehicles to be used, where the
total distance travelled is less than that of the former solution which dispatches
a total of 4 vehicles.
The results shown in Table 2 indicate that load balancing can indeed be
performed by the proposed model. Thus, the decision maker will be able to see
alternative solutions to a single problem by imposing varying lower and/or upper
bounds on the starting loads of the vehicles. The importance of the diﬀerence
between the loads of the trucks and the variations in the optimal value of the
objective function will enlighten the ﬁnal decision.
As far as the distances travelled by each vehicle are concerned, the proposed
model does not have any eﬀect on the variation in these. This is a topic for
further research.

Conclusion

In this paper, the classical CVRP is extended to include the case when the
starting or returning load of a vehicle is restricted to a predetermined value.
Current formulations of the CVRP do not contain such a restriction. Therefore,
we deﬁne and present new bounding constraints for the single and multiple
depot minimal load constrained VRPs. It is further shown that post-optimality
analysis may be conducted with respect to various values of minimal and/or
maximal loads, so that distributions of loads across vehicles can be considered
in the planning phase of the decision process.
The proposed model will allow appropriate sized vehicle routing problems
to be directly solved to optimality with the use of commercial software. For
larger problems, other solution methodologies either based on this model (such
as branch and bound) or model-independent techniques (such as metaheuristics)
can be used. In any case, we believe that the problems deﬁned here and the
related models will constitute a starting point for such research.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no formulation for a minimal
distance constrained VRP (i.e., for a VRP where there is a restriction related
to the minimum distance traveled). The modeling approach presented in this
paper may be applied to this case, and such an application is currently under
consideration.
