1. Introduction
Let us consider the Euler system of compressible gas dynamics in the form
⎧
⎪
∂t ρ + ∇ · (ρu) = 0,
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎨ ∂t (ρu) + ∇ · (ρu ⊗ u) + ∇p = 0,
⎪
⎪
⎪
∂t (ρe) + ∇ · (ρue + pu) = 0,
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩ ∂t (ρS ) + ∇ · (ρuS ) ≥ 0.

(1)

The density is ρ > 0. The velocity is u ∈ Rd where d is the dimension of the problem. In practice d = 1, 2 or 3. The
density of total energy is the sum of the internal energy ε and of the kinetic energy e = ε + 12 |u|2 . The pressure law is
compatible with the entropy in the sense that there exists a positive temperature T such that
T dS = dε + pdτ,

τ=

ρ

(2)

The variable τ is called the speciﬁc volume. The inequality in (1) is to be taken in the weak sense. It selects the
entropy solutions of the Euler system.
The classical approach for the Lagrangian discretization on moving grids of (1) is staggered. We refer to [1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and references therein for a presentation of this topic. The so-called compatible hydrodynamics [3]
lagrangian scheme is a recent improvement: it is by construction conservative for all physical variables. See also [8]
in a Finite Element setting.
Another possibility exists in theory, which consists to use cell centered schemes. But a severe compatibility
issue exists for this approach and it is only recently that new solutions have been proposed to solved this compatibility
problem. In the article we develop an abstract formulation of the cell centered discretization of (1-2) and propose some

tracks for the development of a comprehensive framework of cell centered Lagrangian schemes. More particularly
we discuss the adaptation of the ideas developed in [9] to the discretization of the deformation gradient [10], the
connection between [9] and [11], and we consider a possible construction of exceptional points.

discussion with Misha Shashkov, it appears that a similar treatment of exceptional points for staggered schemes was
known independently of this work.
2. The basic Glace scheme
A typical result of a Lagrange computation in 3D is plotted in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1: Calculation of a Sedov blast wave in 3D.

Consider the volume V j of cell T j . The volume at time tk = kΔt is V kj . We also consider the semi-discrete scheme
that is continuous in time and fully discrete in space: in this case the volume is V j (t). The vertices of the mesh are
nodes xr ∈ Rd : the index for nodes is r. Let us denote x = (x1 , · · · , xr , · · · ) the collection of all vertices. We assume
that the volume V j is deﬁned as a function of the vertices x → V j (x). Let us deﬁne the gradients of the volume V j
C jr = ∇xr V j ∈ Rd .

(3)

Notice that this deﬁnition is correct [9] even for 3D cells with warped faces as it is the case for the isoparamtric (Q1 )
element depicted in ﬁgure 2.
One has by construction
V j (t) = ∇x V j , x =
C jr , ur .

The Euler relation for homogeneous functions holds, so V j = ∇x V j , x = d1 r C jr , xr . It means that the knowledge
of the geometrical vectors C jr is enough to compute the volume of the cell and the variation of this volume. Two more
properties can be deduced. For all cell j one has
C jr = 0.

Figure 2: The faces of the hexahedron are warped. Such a cell is commonly used in multidimensional lagrangian calculations.

If the vertex xr is interior and the volumes of the cells are compatible (their sum is equal to the total volume) then
C jr = 0.

The ﬁrst order Glace scheme is the following. At the beginning of the time step one computes the geometrical vectors
Ckjr , ∀ j, r, in function of the vertices xkr . Then one determines the nodal velocities ur and the nodal pressures p jr by
solving the linear system (c j is the sound speed)

at every time step kΔt. This relation is satisﬁed for all standard meshes, see ([12]). It means that the Glace scheme is
consistent in the weak sense as in the Lax approach.
So ﬁnally the whole scheme is deﬁned in function of these vectors C jr which are deﬁned at a very general level.
In the rest of this work we discuss the use of these C jr vectors for other problems of interest.
3. Discretization of the deformation gradient
Here we present a discrete approach that has been proposed very recently [10] to construct a discrete representative
of the deformation gradient F = ∇X x using the vectors C jr . This is a ﬁrst step for the modeling of material strength.
A simple method consists in solving the lagrangian equation
G(t = tk ) = I

Dtk G = ∇xk · u,

during an elementary time step, starting from a ﬁctitious rest state. One gets the natural discrete equation

where the nodal velocity is to be provided by a generalization of the the nodal solver after convenient modiﬁcations.

In this section we describe a modiﬁcation of Glace which gives back the scheme that has been ﬁrst introduced
in [11] in the 2D case. In [11] it was introduced from a convenient and particular Finite Volume integration of the
lagrangian equations. The construction of an eﬀective Chic-like scheme on simplicial meshes is done in [13]. The
adaptation of the above material is also evident, but it must be stressed that even if it is immediate in dimension two,
the dimension three is still an open problem for general meshes. That is, we do not know how to develop an abstract
deﬁnition of the vectors C jrq (13) in dimension three. The reason is that these vectors C jrq are in practice deﬁned in
function of the faces of the cell [11, 13].
Let us assume nevertheless that all C jr can be decomposed in a sum of vectors
Q

C jrq .

C jr =

(13)

q=1

Somehow it means that the node xr is decomposed into Q virtual nodes. Let us deﬁne 3 virtual nodes, which are in
fact the 3 faces at node xr . This is illustrated in ﬁgure 3 which corresponds to the geometric ideas developed in [11].
From now on we concentrate on the algebraic consequences. By construction one has the formulas
C jrq = 0 and
q

C jrq = 0.

This is enough to construct a new nodal solver. We modify the equations which become p jrq − p j +ρ j c j ur − u j , n jrq =

We ﬁnally notice that the weak consistency criterion (10) is also satisﬁed for this method in the form

q

Ckjrq ⊗ xkr = V kj I.

(14)

This equality is a consequence of (13) and (10).
5. Exceptional points
An exceptional point is usually understood as a point at which the mesh is non conformal, see [14] and references
therein. Let us consider the model situation depicted in ﬁgure 4. The nodes e1 and e2 are diﬀerent from the others,
because we attach them to their neighbors with the formulas
e1 =

1
1
1
1
x6 + x7 and e2 = x7 + x8 .
2

The problem is to deﬁne a lagrangian scheme in such a situation. A classical solution is to consider the mesh is no
longer made only with quadrangles, but also with pentagons. That is the cell number 5 with vertices x6 , e1 , x7 , x9 and
x10 can be viewed as a cell with 5 vertices and 5 edges. The problem is of course that the point e1 is no more attached
to its neighbors, that is e1 12 x6 + 12 x7 will appear during the lagrangian history of the mesh.
Our purpose is to show that the formalism developed in this work oﬀers a immediate theoretical solution. It is
suﬃcient to apply directly the abstract deﬁnition of C jr . That is we consider that the area of the cell j can be computed
in function of the free points which are the vertices of the mesh x1,2,··· ,11 . The exceptional points e1 and e2 are not free
points.
The standard method to compute the area of cell j = 1 can be written as
1
1
V1 = V (x1 , x2 , x6 , e1 ) = V x1 , x2 , x6 , x6 + x7 .

Figure 4: The nodes e1 and e2 are exceptional

Let us deﬁne the “classical” vectors
C11 = ∇α V (x1 , x2 , x6 , e1 ) , C12 = ∇β V (x1 , x2 , x6 , e1 ) ,
C16 = ∇γ V (x1 , x2 , x6 , e1 ) , C1e1 = ∇δ V (x1 , x2 , x6 , e1 ) .
The “new” deﬁnition of the vectors, let us call them C1r , is obtained by taking the partial derivatives of V1 with respect
to x1 , x2 , x4 and x5 . Therefore one gets by an easy computation
C11 = C11 , C12 = C12
and

1
1
C16 = C16 + C1e1 , C17 = C1e1 .

All other vectors C jr are easily computed from the standard C jr . By construction the theoretical properties are preserved. In particular equation (5) for j = 1 writes
C11 + C12 + C16 + C17 = 0.
A less evident property is the equation (6) for the node x7
6

C j7 = 0.
j=1

Once these vectors have been computed, the theoretical deﬁnition of the Glace scheme follows as before. The matrix
A7 which is inverted to predict the velocity of the node x7 is the sum of 6 rank one matrices. For the moment this
construction is purely theoretical. Other type of exceptional points, also called hanging nodes, can be treated by this
method. The deﬁnition of exceptional points in dimension three with this methodology is completely open.
6. Conclusion
We have presented various aspects of cell-centered discretization of Lagrangian equations for compressible ﬂows.
The emphasis was put on a uniﬁed framework where everything can be deduced from the deﬁnition of the volume of
the cells with respect to the vertices of the mesh. Many open problems subsist in dimension three. More research is
needed to assess the interest of this approach for the deﬁnition of new and accurate cell-centered Lagrangian schemes.
