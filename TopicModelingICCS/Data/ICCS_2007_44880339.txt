Abstract. Various interactions of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
proteins with those of the host cell are known, but a large-scale network
encompassing all known interactions of HIV-1 proteins and host cell proteins
have not been analyzed or visualized. This is partly because large-scale
interaction data are not readily available from public databases and individual
literatures report small-scale interactions. NCBI recently released a database of
all known interactions of HIV-1 proteins and human proteins. Now, a
challenging task is to analyze all the interactions in a systematic way and to
identify biologically meaningful interaction groups or patterns. This paper
presents the development of a web-based system (http://hiv1.hpid.org) for
visualizing and analyzing the large-scale interactions between HIV-1 and
human proteins and the comparative analysis of the interactions. The whole
interaction network contains 1,768 interactions of 65 different types with 810
human proteins. The analysis identified several interesting interaction groups
from the comparative analysis of the interaction networks.

1 Introduction
Twenty years following its discovery, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
remains a major threat to public health and a challenge for drug development [1].
Various interactions of HIV-1 proteins with those of the host cell are known, but a
large-scale network encompassing all known interactions of HIV-1 proteins and host
cell proteins have not been analyzed or visualized. This is partly because large-scale
interaction data are not readily available from public databases and individual
literatures report small-scale interactions.
NCBI recently released a database of all known interactions of HIV-1 proteins and
human proteins (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions/). Now, a
challenging task is to analyze all the interactions in a systematic way and to identify
biologically meaningful interaction groups or patterns. We have developed a webbased system (http://hiv1.hpid.org) for systematically analyzing the large-scale
interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins and the comparative analysis of the
interactions. Comparative analysis of the interactions between HIV-1 and human
proteins using the system revealed several interesting interaction groups. This is the

first online system for interactively visualizing and analyzing the interactions of
HIV-1 and human proteins. This paper presents the system and some analysis results.

2 Methods
We have constructed a web-based HIV-1 database (http://hiv1.hpid.org) for the
analysis of the experimental data on the interactions between HIV-1 and human
proteins.
The
experimental
data
were
extracted
from NCBI
at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/HIVInteractions. The whole interaction network
contains 1,768 interactions between 11 HIV-1 proteins and 810 human proteins
(Fig. 1). All the 65 types of protein-protein interactions shown in Table 1 were
included in our analysis.

Fig. 1. The whole interaction network between 11 HIV-1 proteins and 810 human proteins.
This network contains 1768 interactions of 65 different types. HIV-1 proteins are displayed in
yellow in the networks.

Different HIV-1 proteins have different number of human proteins as their
interacting partners (Fig. 2). HIV-1 tat protein has 667 human protein partners, which
is the largest number of known human protein partners for a single HIV-1 protein.
Table 2 shows the number of human proteins interacting with HIV-1 proteins,
interactions that share human protein partners with other HIV-1 proteins, and the
interactions of the “interact with” type that share human protein partners with other
HIV-1 proteins. The numbers in the last row (total) represent the number of nonredundant occurrences (that is, duplicate occurrences of a same entity are counted

only once). In the first and second columns, all types of interactions are considered,
and the third column considers the interactions of the “interact with” type. The reason
that the number of interactions differs from the number of proteins in the second
column is because different types of interactions are counted more than once for a
same pair of proteins. The interacting human proteins with an HIV-1 protein are
visualized by our program called InterViewer [2, 3] as a star-shaped networks
centered at the HIV-1 protein. We performed pairwise comparison of the interaction
networks to find interaction groups.

3 Results and Discussion
From the comparative analysis of HIV-1 interaction networks, we identified several
interaction groups of human proteins. Human proteins in a same interaction group
always have the same set of HIV-1 proteins as their interacting partners. There are a
total 23 interaction groups, 2 in network A, 1 in network B, 7 in network C, and 13 in
network D (Fig. 3). Each interaction group of human proteins is shown in a red round
box, and interacting HIV-1 proteins are shown in yellow round boxes.
The network in Fig. 3A shows 2 groups of human proteins with 5 interacting
HIV-1 proteins. 2 human proteins in a group, NP_002736 and NP_002737, have the
same interacting partners of HIV-1 proteins p6, tat, rev, vif, and matrix. Human
proteins NP_002736 and NP_002737 are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1
and 3, respectively. MAPK has been shown to regulate HIV-1 infectivity by
phosphorylating vif [4]. Phosphorylation of vif by a serine/threonine protein kinase(s)
plays an important role in regulating HIV-1 replication and infectivity. The gagderived protein p6 of HIV-1 plays a crucial role in the release of virions from the
membranes of infected cells [5]. Three human proteins in the group {NP_002256,
NP_002261, NP_002262} in Fig. 3A have the same interacting partners of tat, rev,
integrase, matrix, and vpr. NP_002256, NP_002261, and NP_002262 are karyopherin
beta 1, transportin 1, RAN binding protein 5, respectively.
Fig. 3B shows an interaction group of 8 human proteins {NP_002145, NP_002146,
NP_004125, NP_005336, NP_005337, NP_005338, NP_006588, NP_068814}, all
interact with vpr, matrix, tat, and gag. The 8 human proteins are the members of the
Hsp70 protein family, and by controlled binding and release, facilitate the folding,
oligomeric assembly-disassembly, and intracellular transport of protein complexes.
Fig. 3C shows 7 interaction groups of human proteins, each with a same set of 3
HIV-1 protein partners. Among the interaction groups, the group of 40 human
proteins interacting with integrase, vif and tat is the largest. The network in Fig. 3D
shows 13 interaction groups of human proteins. The human proteins in a same
interaction group share a same set of 2 interacting partners. The group interacting
with tat and vpr is the largest, containing 42 human proteins.
Fig. 4 shows an interaction network of HIV-1 and human proteins, consisting of
interactions of “interact with” type only. The network shows 98 interactions between
11 HIV-1 proteins and 49 human proteins. The human proteins shared by the vif and
tat genes (enclosed in a red box in the network) are proteasome (prosome, macropain)
subunits of a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure.
Fig. 5 shows the number of interacting human proteins of each HIV-1 protein and
the interactions of the “interact with” type that share human protein partners with
other HIV-1 proteins. HIV-1 tat protein has the largest number of interacting human
proteins as well as the largest number of interactions of the “interact with” type.
In summary, 6 out of total 810 human proteins (0.7%) interact with exactly 5
HIV-1 proteins (the interaction groups in Fig. 3A), 12 human proteins (1.5%) interact
with exactly 4 HIV-1 proteins (Fig. 3B), 81 human proteins (10%) interact with
exactly 3 HIV-1 proteins (the interaction groups in Fig. 3C), 105 human proteins
(13%) interact with exactly 2 HIV-1 proteins (Fig. 3D), and 606 human proteins
(74.8%) interact with only one HIV-1 protein. There is no human protein that
interacts with more than 5 HIV-1 proteins.

4 Conclusion
Most of the interactions between virus and host cells are complex and have not been
fully understood despite the substantial discoveries in recent years. Investigating
virus-host interactions is important for understanding viral replication and for
identifying new targets with potential for drug intervention. We have constructed a
web-based HIV-1 database (http://hiv1.hpid.org) for the comparative analysis of the
experimental data on the interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins.
Comparative analysis of the interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins using the
system revealed several interesting interaction groups. Our work can be extended in
several directions. First, biological experiments can be performed to identify
functions or other biological properties common to all proteins in the same interaction
group. Second, our study analyzed the interactions between HIV-1 and human
proteins, but can be expanded to include the interactions between human proteins.
Finally, our system should be updated to include the interaction data for the HIV-1 nef
protein, which has been added to the HIV-1 database of NCBI very recently. We
believe that this is the first online system for the comparative analysis of the
interactions networks of HIV-1 and human proteins and that it is a valuable tool for
scientists in the field of protein-protein interactions and HIV/AIDS research.
