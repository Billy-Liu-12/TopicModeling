Abstract
Predictions in subsurface formations consists of two steps: characterization and prediction using the characterization. In the characterization, we reconstruct the subsurface properties, such as distributions of permeability and
porosity, with a set of limited data. A Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is well
suited for reconstructing permeability and porosity ﬁelds. This statistical approach aims at generating a Markov chain
from which a stationary, posterior distribution of the characteristics of the subsurface may be constructed. A crucial
step in this framework is the calculation of the likelihood information which can be computationally very demanding.
This limitation hinders the application of the Bayesian framework for the ﬂow predictions in porous media in a practical period of time. The parallel computation of multiple MCMCs can substantially reduce computation time and can
make the framework more suitable to subsurface ﬂows. In this paper, we consider multi–MCMC and compare the
multi–MCMC with the MCMCs for the predictions of subsurface ﬂows.

1. Introduction
Oil recovery and energy security, CO2 sequestration, and monitoring and remediation of subsurface aquifer contamination each may be viewed as forecasting problems wherein we want to predict quantities—fractions of oil and
water, CO2 concentration, or concentration of radioactive particles—using subsurface ﬂuid ﬂow models with expertise
and limited data.
Our strategy consists of establishing a complete statistical description of subsurface properties, such as permeability and porosity that are conditioned to existing measurement data. A Bayesian approach using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is well suited for reconstructing permeability and porosity ﬁelds. This statistical
approach aims at generating a Markov chain from which a stationary, posterior distribution of the characteristics of

the subsurface may be constructed. A crucial step in this framework is the calculation of the likelihood information
which involves solving coupled partial diﬀerential equations with permeability and porosity as input parameters. The
ﬂow simulator computation time and the sequential nature of MCMC simulation limit the posterior exploration in a
practical period of time. To make things worse, we often explore a high-dimensional posterior distribution in these
applications.
It is imperative to address this limitation appropriately using parallel MCMCs that make the posterior exploration
tractable. An MCMC algorithm can be parallelized in two ways: (1) running multiple MCMCs in parallel, or (2)
parallelization of a single MCMC by pre–fetching algorithm [6]. The debate on one long chain or several shorter
chains is still very loud among statisticians [1, 2]. In a single long MCMC, the chain will be “closer” to the target
distribution at the end of the run compared to the many shorter MCMC runs. High-dimensional problems often have
longer burn-in periods and that several shorter runs may be a waste of resources since the burn-in period must be
discarded from each shorter chain. Geyer [1] argues that if you cannot get a good answer with one long run, then
you cannot get a good answer with many shorter runs either. In contrast, the camp which supports several multiple
chains argues that, although a single run will eventually cover the entire sample space, by taking a number of parallel
MCMCs, we can make sure that no portion of the sample space is unexplored. They also argue that several shorter
runs can better diagnose non-convergence.
Since the forecasting production in porous media requires long simulation times for likelihood computations and
the convergence rate is very slow, we want to speed-up generation of a single MCMC. The regeneration technique [3,
4], which is suitable typically for problems with low-dimensional state-space, is not applicable in this case, because
our application entails exploration of very high-dimensional posterior distribution. When the state-space is highdimensional, we can divide the state-space into blocks, and then for each iteration of the MCMC we can send each
block to a separate GPU [5]. This approach helps to speed-up the generation of single MCMC. However, it requires
additional eﬀort to carry out analysis of the limiting distribution in order to come up with appropriate blocks. When
the conditional dependence structure in a limiting distribution is complicated, it can be very challenging. Brockwell
in [6] presented a case study in which this approach is not applicable. As an alternative, he presented a pre-fetching
algorithm which does not require any particular analysis of the limiting distribution of the MCMC to speed-up the
generation of a single MCMC by parallelization. In this algorithm, the multiple likelihoods are computed ahead of
time and in turn only the ones needed are used to proceed. This algorithm obviously has limitations in terms of parallel
eﬃciency. Strid showed how to use available information to make better predictions of the future states of the MCMC
chain and substantially increase the eﬃciency of the pre–fetching algorithm [7]. As indicated in a recent study by the
authors [8], it helps to speed-up the generation of a single MCMC. However, for more challenging real problems this
speed-up may not be adequate to oﬀer a reliable prediction in a practical period of time.
One would like to have a single MCMC for the exploration. However, considering the simulation time needed
for the applications in porous media, there is no hope of exploring all the possibilities in a practical period of time
in a single MCMC. For the prediction, we want to explore all the possibilities (if we can) of the productions that
may occur given the partial production curves. Based on the available production data, we collect all the possible
proﬁles of the parameters that give almost similar production curves with the speciﬁed precision associated with the
measurement and the simulated numerical solution. For this purpose, multiple MCMCs can be very attractive. In
the approach of multiple MCMCs, if we start with a diﬀerent seed for each MCMC, we can increase the chance of
exploring more possibilities. This is more on the desirable side of the prediction. Also, the multi–MCMC uses the
hardware more eﬃciently and consequently, is very applicable to more computationally demanding problems. In this
paper, we consider multi–MCMC for the prediction of production for a two-phase ﬂow problem.
This paper is organized as follows. We discuss the physical and mathematical modeling of the problem at hand
in section 2. The parametrization of uncertainty using the Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion for unknown permeability and
porosity ﬁelds is discussed in section 3. In section 4, we discuss a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty
in both permeability and porosity ﬁelds. In the numerical simulations in section 5, we implement multi–MCMC to
predict the partial production curves in an oil reservoir and compare the multi–MCMC to the MCMCs. Section 6
contains our conclusions.

2. Physical and Mathematical Modeling
The dynamics of the motion of ﬂuids in a heterogeneous reservoir Ω, which is considered here, is categorized
as an immiscible two-phase system with water and oil (denoted by w and o, respectively) that is incompressible. To
simplify the model, capillary pressure and gravity are not included, there is no mass transfer between phases, and
the two ﬂuids ﬁll the pore space. The reservoir is equipped with an injection well from which water is discharged to
displace the trapped oil towards the production wells. The injection well is located in one of the corners. We have
two production wells: one well is situated along the diagonal, opposite to the injection well, and the other is situated
at the center of a side which is one of the two sides that enclose the production well at the corner (see Figure 2). The
wells are modeled through appropriate boundary conditions. The governing equations of ﬂow and transport are
∇ · v = 0, where v = −λ(s)k(x)∇p, x ∈ Ω,

(2.1)

and

∂s
+ ∇ · ( f (s)v) = 0,
(2.2)
∂t
where v is the Darcy velocity, s is the water saturation, k is the absolute permeability and φ is the porosity. The total
mobility λ(s) and the ﬂux function f (s) are respectively given by:
φ(x)

λ(s) =

=

krw (s)/μw
,
λ(s)

(2.3)

where kr j , j = w, o, is the relative permeability of the phase j [9].
We consider sampling of two important physical quantities–permeability and porosity–of the oil reservoir using
partial fractional curves as governing measurements. For each production boundary the fractional ﬂow F(t) is deﬁned
as the fraction of oil in the produced ﬂuid, i.e.,
F(t) = 1 −

(2.5)

where V p is the total pore-volume of the reservoir and T denotes the time taken for injection of water. The system
(2.1) is simulated using an eﬃcient and reliable physics-based operator splitting technique (see for example [10, 11]
for further discussion), which is implemented on GPU machines.
3. Parametrization of Uncertainty
In the current work, we employ the Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion (KLE) [12, 13] to reduce the potentially large
dimension of the uncertainty space describing the permeability and porosity which is accomplished through appropriate parametrization inherent in the expansion (see for example [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] for similar applications).
A standard assumption in geostatistics is to model the permeability to follow a log-normal distribution [19], i.e.,
log [k(x, ω)] = Y k (x, ω), where x ∈ Ω ⊂ R2 , and ω is a random element in a probability space, and Y k (x, ω) is a ﬁeld
possessing a Gaussian distribution and a covariance function

where, L = diag(L x , Ly ) with the correlation lengths L x and Ly in x- and y-direction, respectively, and σ2Y = E[(Y k )2 ].
Here, the correlation length is the distance from a point in Ω beyond which there is no further correlation of a physical
property (permeability or porosity) associated with that point. The series representation of Y k (x, ω) is

that makes Yik uncorrelated, and λi = E[(Yik )2 ] > 0. Denoting θik = Yik / λi , then θik satisﬁes E(θik ) = 0 and E(θik θkj ) =

We assume that eigenvalues {λi }∞
i=1 are ordered so that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · . The basis functions ϕi (x) in (3.3) are deterministic and resolve the spatial dependence of the permeability ﬁeld and in particular its correlation structure. The
uncertainty is represented by the scalar random variables θik . In general, we only need to keep the leading order terms
(quantiﬁed by the magnitude of λi ) and still capture most of the energy of the stochastic process Y k (x, ω).
With respect to the porosity ﬁeld, we make use of the standard assumption that the porosity exhibits a similar
spatial correlation structure to the permeability. In turn, this allows us to employ (3.4). The dependence of porosity to
the expansion is expressed as
φ
φmin + φmax eY
φ(x) =
, φmin and φmax ∈ (0, 1),
(3.5)
1 + eY φ
where Y φ is KLE for porosity as in (3.4), and φmin and φmax are the lower and upper limits of the porosity of the
reservoir.
4. Bayesian Inference
As alluded to earlier, we want to sample the permeability and porosity ﬁelds conditioned on the available fractional
ﬂow data Fm . This is translated into sampling from the conditional distribution P(ψ|Fm ), where ψ = [θk θφ ] with θk

and θφ vectors containing the random coeﬃcients in the KL expansions. According to Bayes’ theorem this distribution
satisﬁes the proportionality relation
(4.1)
P(ψ|Fm ) ∝ P(Fm |ψ)P(ψ),
where P(Fm |ψ) represents the likelihood function (that requires the forward solution of the two-phase ﬂow) and P(ψ)
is the prior distribution of ψ. The normalizing constant in this expression is not important, because we use an iterative
updating procedure. We assume that the likelihood function follows a Gaussian distribution. i.e.,
P(Fm |ψ) ∝ exp − (Fm − Fψ ) Σ(Fm − Fψ ) ,

(4.2)

where Fψ is the simulated fractional ﬂow curve that is obtained by solving the forward problem with known permeability k and porosity φ, in other words with known ψ, and Σ is the covariance matrix representing the measurement
errors. We take Σ = I/2σ2F , where I is the identity matrix and σ2F is the precision associated with the measurement
Fm and numerical solution Fψ .
In practice, both porosity and permeability might be dependent on each other, and that is the reason we take the
same KL expansion structure for both ﬁelds. However, when we make a proposal, we assume that θk and θφ are
independent of each other and thus avoiding ad-hoc use of a correlation between porosity and permeability.
We use the Metropolis-Hasting MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution. At each iteration, ψ p = [θkp θφp ]
is proposed using an instrumental distribution q(ψ p |ψ), where ψ represents the previously accepted state/parameters
in the chain, and then the forward problem is solved to determine the acceptance probability,
α(ψ, ψ p ) = min 1,

i.e., ψ p is accepted with probability α(ψ, ψ p ).
5. Numerical Simulations
We now discuss the simulations of the two-phase ﬂow problem in an oil reservoir as illustrated and present the
associated numerical results. We have two production wells: one well is situated along the diagonal, opposite to the

injection well, and the other is situated at the center of a side which is one of the two sides that enclose the production
well at the corner. We refer to them as corner and center wells, respectively (see Figure 2). The relative permeability
functions of water and oil take the form of s2 and (1 − s)2 , respectively, and the viscosity ratio between water and oil
is 1:20. We assume that at t = 0, the reservoir is saturated by oil without any water, i.e., s = 0. The water is then
injected at the injection well at the rate of one pore-volume every ﬁve years.
The σ2F in the likelihood function (4.2) must be ﬁxed a priori [20], because treating σ2F as an unknown parameter
results in an unacceptably large estimate. In our application, we specify σ2F = 10−4 .
For KLE in (3.4), we select the correlation length L x = Ly = 0.2 and variance σY 2 = 4. Figure 1 shows that
the eigenvalues decay very fast for these values, and it is enough to consider the ﬁrst twenty eigenvalues in the KLE.
Since we assume that the permeability and porosity share the same spatial structure, we share the same KLE structure
for the permeability and porosity ﬁelds, with Nk = Nφ = 20. Twenty eigenvalues lead to the exploration of a highdimensional posterior in the MCMC framework. Therefore, we employ a component-wise tuning for the posterior
exploration.
We use synthetic proﬁles for permeability and porosity distributions. These proﬁles enable us to create realistic
behavior of subsurfaces. Then, using these proﬁles we run the ﬂow simulator and produce the production curves. We
use these production curves as the reference production curves in our simulation study.
Figure 3 shows a comparison of computing times for MCMC and multi–MCMC. The average computing time is
computed using all three MCMCs. In this case the speed–up is about 3 when we use the multi–MCMC.
The forecasting of production curves in the oil reservoir consists of two steps: characterization and prediction. In
the ﬁrst step, we characterize the underlying ﬁeld using the available data (in our case, the production curves until 0.4
PVI). Because of the nature of the inverse problem at hand, it is expected that we cannot recover a unique proﬁle for
permeability and porosity nor is it necessary. In practice, it is more relevant to gather a set of probable proﬁles that
has been rigorously selected by the Bayesian MCMC, run the forward problem (in our case, the production curves
until 1.4 PVI) using those accepted proﬁles, and then, aggregate the results of the forward problem to predict the rest
of the production curve. We refer this curve as the prediction of production curve.
Obviously, all the accepted proﬁles give a very similar set of partial production curves. However, there is no
way we can select the exact proﬁle for the underlying ﬁeld. In this case, we consider all the proﬁles and predict the
production using those proﬁles. This way we make the predictions more reliable. The more the samples, the more
reliable the predictions.
Next we look at the prediction of production curves. We consider three MCMCs generated from diﬀerent seeds.
For the multi–MCMCs, we consider an equal number of proposals from each chain. Figure 4 shows the predictions
using 4500 proposals in each chain and the combination of three chains considering 1500 proposals from each chain.
In each chain, 10% of total proposals are discarded for the prediction. The vertical line separates the measured
production curves and the predicted production curves. Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7 show the predictions using
9000, 18000 and 36000 proposals, respectively. As illustrated by the numerical results reported in the above mentioned
ﬁgures, we have an indication that the reliability of the predictions based on a single chain is comparable to the
reliability of predictions based on multiple chains. Our results suggest that we can consider multi–MCMC approach
for prediction in porous media ﬂows in a practical period of time.
6. Conclusion
We considered a Bayesian statistical approach for the prediction of ﬂows in an oil reservoir. In this approach we
need to compute the likelihood function for each proposal in an MCMC method. The computation of the likelihood
function is computationally very demanding for the applications in porous media. It often limits the applicability of
the Bayesian framework to these applications. In this paper, we showed that the multi–MCMC approach can alleviate
this limitation and this approach makes the Bayesian framework more attractive to produce ﬂow predictions in porous
media.
