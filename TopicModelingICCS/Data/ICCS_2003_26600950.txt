Abstract. There are so many fuzzy informations in databases waiting to be
explored; methods to analyze these fuzzy data are needed. After a series of
topics of correlation among fuzzy sets has been studied, namely, simple [3] and
partial correlation analysis [4] of fuzzy sets, we want to study more about
multiple relationships among fuzzy sets. In this paper, we will generalize the
discussion of linear relationship between fuzzy attribute-pairs to linear
relationship among one dependent fuzzy attribute and several independent
fuzzy attributes, measured by multiple correlation coefficient of fuzzy set. We
will also discuss the fact that the regression coefficients of a multiple linear
regression model of one dependent fuzzy attribute on several independent fuzzy
attributes can be used to obtain the multiple correlation coefficients among the
particular dependent and those independent fuzzy attributes in the regression
model.

1 Introduction
Data volumes get larger so rapidly, many data may be fuzzy but useful, waiting to be
explored, methods to investigate these fuzzy data are needed. In previous studies [3]
and [4], we have discussed the simple and partial correlation analysis on Zadeh’s
fuzzy sets [9,10,12,13]. In analyzing the fuzzy attributes in databases, simple
correlation coefficients [3] provides us with a good sense of linear relationship of
fuzzy attribute-pairs, while a partial correlation coefficient [4] shows the linear
relationship between two fuzzy attributes when the influence of other fuzzy attributes
are partialed out.
But, sometimes we have doubts that fuzzy attributes in a database may have
contributed to the result of a specific dependent fuzzy attribute. Therefore, in this
paper, the idea of correlation between fuzzy attribute-pair will be generalized to
finding the linear relationship between one dependent fuzzy attribute and several
independent fuzzy attributes, we will measure it by multiple correlation coefficients
of fuzzy attributes.
In Section 2, a definition of multiple correlation coefficients of fuzzy attributes is
given and properties of multiple correlation coefficients are noted. The same fuzzy
data set from the university student activity example in [4] are used in computing the
multiple correlation coefficients.
Relationship between multiple linear regression and multiple correlation coefficient
are discussed in Section 3. A statistics, coefficient of multiple determinations, can be

obtained from the regression coefficients of a multiple regression model, which
measures the combined effect of independent fuzzy attributes on the dependent fuzzy
attribute in the regression model. In fact, this coefficient of multiple determinations is
the square of multiple correlation coefficient, we have a study on this matter.
In the last paragraph, we will talk about the related area of further studies. Methods
proposed in this paper and papers [3] and [4], may be applied to discover
characteristics and the relationships among the fuzzy data in order to generate useful
rules in data mining of fuzzy data.

2 Multiple Correlation Analysis of Fuzzy Sets
Here, multiple correlation coefficients are defined for considering p independent
fuzzy attributes A1 , A2 ,L ,A p to correlate one dependent fuzzy attribute O.
Suppose we have a random sample )x1 -x2 -L-x n *, drawn from a crisp set X.
Membership grades, { µO )x i

* and µ Aj ( x i ) , for j = 1,…, p}, of dependent fuzzy

attribute O and independent fuzzy attributes A1 , A2 ,L , Ap are attached to each
observation xi. Now we want to examine the linear relationship between dependent
fuzzy attribute O and independent fuzzy attributes
correlation coefficient,

A1 , A2 ,L , Ap by multiple

R O•1,2,L, p , defined as follows:

Definitation 1. Multiple correlation coefficients for fuzzy sets (i). In order to find
the multiple correlation between a dependent attribute O and some independent fuzzy
attributes

A1 , A2 ,L , Ap , the sample covariance matrix needs to be computed first

S

 S 21 S 22 
S22 = sOO = sO2 is the sample variance of fuzzy attribute O. S12 is the transpose of
S21 , and represents the vector of covariance, sOj , of fuzzy attribute-pair ( AO , A j ) ,

as in [4], it is then partitioned into four parts S

where j=1,…,p.

S22 is a symmetric p × p matrix, represents the covariance s ij of

fuzzy attribute-pair

( Ai , A j ) , where i=1,…p and j=1,…,p.

The multiple correlation coefficient between fuzzy attribute O and fuzzy attributes

A1 , A2 ,L , Ap can then be obtained by

R O•1,L, p =

Let us illustrate this result in a simple case when p=2. Assume that we have three

(iv) 0 ≤ R O •1, 2 ≤ 1 . Since R O•
1 , 2 is a ratio of partial variance to total variance,
which is positive and always ≤ 1 , therefore, the positive square root of it is
0 ≤ R O • A,C ≤ 1 .

An example, in previous discussion of partial correlation analysis [4], we have used a
university student activity sample and noticed that fuzzy attributes A, C, and E may
have contributed to the result of fuzzy attribute O. We refer the fuzzy attribute O, the
objective accomplishment, as a dependent attribute, and fuzzy attributes A, C, and E
as independent attributes, representing group atmosphere, group leader, and group
environment respectively. The result of multiple correlation analysis ought to show
how the independent fuzzy attributes A, C, and E may be involved to what extent in
the result of the dependent fuzzy attribute O in this fuzzy data set.
Multiple correlation coefficients between dependent fuzzy attribute O and pairs of
combinations of independent fuzzy attributes A, C, and E can be computed from
equation (2.1): R O • AC = 0.4998, R O • AE = 0.4850, R O•CE = 0.2144.
Similarly, multiple correlation coefficient of the dependent fuzzy attribute O
regarding to three independent fuzzy attributes A, C, and E, can be computed:

R O• ACE = 0.5024.

Multiple Linear Regression vs. Multiple Correlation

In a database including an interesting dependent fuzzy attribute O and some related
independent fuzzy attributes A1 -A2 and A3 , attached with their membership
grades, { µO )x i

* and µ A1 ( x i ) , µ A2 ( x i ) , µ A3 ( x i ) }, now, let us consider

a simple fuzzy linear regression line of fuzzy attribute O on fuzzy attribute A1,
∧

µ O = b0 + b1 µ A1

, ( µO

and µ A1 are as defined in previous section). The effect

of independent fuzzy attribute A1 on the variance of O, can be measured by a
coefficient of simple determination

2
rO1
. This means that independent fuzzy attribute

2

A1 accounts for 100( rO1 )% of the total variance of dependent fuzzy attribute O. The
coefficient of simple determination can be found from the regression coefficient,

R O•1 is actually the simple

Next, let us examine the combined effect of independent fuzzy

This effect can be measured by the

coefficient of multiple determination, R O•12 , that means that 100( R O•12 )% of the
total variance of dependent fuzzy attribute O is accounted for by independent fuzzy
attributes A1 and A2 . Where R O •12 is the multiple correlation coefficient of

A1 and A2 on O.
The coefficient of multiple determinations can also be obtained from the regression

Here,

Now, a third independent fuzzy attribute A3 is introduced into the regression model,

∧

µ O = b0 + b1 µ A1 + b2 µ A 2 + b3 µ A 3 , the effect of combining all three independent
fuzzy attributes, A1 -A2 and A3 on the dependent fuzzy attribute O, is measured by
2
the coefficient of multiple determination, R O•123 , from which we know that
2
100( R O•123 )% of the total variance in dependent fuzzy attribute O is accounted for
by attributes A1 -A2 and A3 .
Also, the coefficient of multiple determination can be computed from the
regression coefficients as:

R O2 •123 = b1 ⋅

multiple correlation coefficient of A1 -A2 and A3 on O. From the discussion of this
section, we have another way of determine multiple correlation coefficients.
Definitation 2. Multiple correlation coefficients for fuzzy sets (ii). If the multiple
linear regression equation of independent fuzzy attributes

A1 , A2 ,L , Ap on the

dependent fuzzy attribute O is known,
∧

µ O = b0 + b1 µ A1 + b2 µ A 2 + L + b p µ A p .

Then the multiple correlation coefficient between fuzzy attribute O and

(3.2)

Where sOO and sOi , i = 1,L, p are the same as in equation (2.2).
An example, from the result of the university student activity sample [3,4], we
obtain the simple linear regression line of dependent fuzzy attribute O on independent

fuzzy attributes A, µO = 0.3542 + 0.5771 µ A .

Then, coefficient of simple

Which means, 23.52% of the total variation of dependent fuzzy attribute O (degree
of the objective accomplishment), is explained by fuzzy attribute A (group
atmosphere). Or, the simple correlation coefficient between fuzzy attribute O and
fuzzy attribute A is 0.4850, as that in [3].
When two independent fuzzy attributes A, C are introduced into the regression
∧

model, we have µ O = 0.1514 + 0.5500 µ A + 0.2420 µ C .

That means, 24.98% of the total variance of dependent fuzzy attribute O is
explained by the combined effect of A (group atmosphere) and C (characteristics of
group leader). It also leads to that the multiple correlation coefficient of A and C
on O is 0.4998, which corresponds to the result in previous paragraph.
Now, independent fuzzy attribute E (group environment) is added to the regression

This figure shows that 25.24% of the total variance of dependent fuzzy attribute O

E. Also, we can see that the multiple correlation coefficient of A, C and E on
dependent fuzzy attribute O is 0.5024 as obtained from equation (2.1) in previous
section.

4 Conclusions
Correlation analysis among attributes in a database usually interests us; the
correlation analysis for ordinary crisp data has been discussed for a long time in
conventional statistics and related applications [1,2,5]. In the mean time, many fuzzy
attributes existed in databases are getting more and more interested to the researchers;
our objective is to extend the correlation analysis to fuzzy attributes in analyzing
fuzzy data. By adopting the methods from mathematical statistics, definitions has
been proposed for simple correlation coefficient on fuzzy sets [3], partial correlation
coefficient on fuzzy sets [4], and, in this paper, multiple correlation coefficient on
fuzzy sets.
As data volumes grow exponentially, massive fuzzy information in databases have
not yet been discovered, which may represent important facts or past experiences. To
mine knowledge and generate useful rules from fuzzy data is our goal to pursue.
Methods proposed in this paper and papers [3] and [4], can be applied to discover
characteristics and the relationships among the fuzzy data in order to generate useful
rules in data mining of fuzzy data.
