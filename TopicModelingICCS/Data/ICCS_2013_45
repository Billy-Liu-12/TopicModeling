Abstract
The main goal of this work is to propose a mathematical model, based on two-dimensional cellular automata (CA), to
simulate an infectious disease outbreak. Speciﬁcally, we revisit the general deterministic SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious
Recovered) model by adding terms describing the spatial spreading of disease. The state of each cell is a 4-tuple where each
component represents the portion of each compartment in the cell at a given time step. We emphasis the role of the basic
reproduction number and its relation with some spatial characteristics of CA models. We study in particular, the impact of
the neighborhood structure in relation to the spread of such infectious diseases. The presented model will serve as a basis to
simulate real epidemics and will also be concerned with the control problem where eﬃcient strategies for disease spread have
to be investigated.
Keywords: Cellular automata ; Epidemics spreading; SEIR; Basic reproduction number; modiﬁed neighborhood

1. Introduction
The spread of communicable diseases is often described mathematically by compartmental models. In our
work, we proposed a deterministic CA based on the standard SEIR model. The total population which assumed
to be constant, is partitioned into four compartments depending on the epidemiological status of individuals:
Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and recovered with full immunity. We assume that space consists of a regular
2-dimensional lattice that represents geographical distribution of the epidemic. Speciﬁcally, each cell stands
for a square portion of the ground where the epidemic is spreading. The population size is normalized to 1
so that the cell state, represented by a 4-tuple, is given by the fractions of susceptible, exposed, infected and
recovered individuals [1, 2]. On this lattice, we deﬁne a local neighborhood of size n which describe the local
interactions. We will consider ﬁrst a classical Moore neighborhood and then compare with a modiﬁed one where
some randomly selected cells may be not in contact with anyone. We study the inﬂuence of the neighborhood
structure on the epidemic spreading by determining the basic reproduction number. This indicator, generally
denoted by R0 is one of the most important parameters studied in the mathematical epidemiology [3, 4, 5]. We
show that the value R0 depends on the neighborhood structure.

2. Model Formulation
The CA model proposed here is derived from the deterministic SEIR model. The variation from the standard
SIR, SIS or SIRS models is that they do not consider latent class so that a person who catches the disease becomes
infectious instantaneously. However, several diseases, such as Inﬂuenza, measles and mumps [2, 6], have a latent
period, during which individuals are exposed to the disease but are not yet infectious. Our studied SEIR CA model
is described as follows:
• The space is represented by a a two-dimensional square lattice where each cell is denoted by its coordinates
(i, j),
• The state of cell (i, j) at time t denoted by sti, j , is characterized by the 4-tuple (S i,t j , Ei,t j , Ii,t j , Rti, j ) which
correspond to the portions of healthy individuals who are susceptible to infection, exposed individuals who
are infected individuals that can not transmit the disease by contact, infectious who are infected individuals
that can transmit the disease to susceptible ones, and recovered individuals that are immunized against
the disease respectively. The state space is then S = [0, 1]4 . However, because of the discrete nature
of the state space, we suppose that for each portion p ∈ [0, 0.01[, it will be 0.01, if p ∈ [0.01, 0.02[,
we will take 0.02 and ﬁnally for p ∈ [0.09, 1[, we will take 1. So the considered state space will be
S = {0.00, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99, 1}4 which is formed by 1014 elements.
• The neighborhood N of size n will be deﬁned for more simplicity as the set of coordinates (α, β): N =
{(αk , βk ), 1 ≤ k ≤ n} ∈ Z × Z and the neighborhood of cell (i, j) which will be denoted by Ni j , is given by
the set {(i + α1 , j + β1 ), ..., (i + αn , j + βn )},
• The transition function f which gives the state of cell (i, j) at time (t + 1) in terms of the states of its
neighbouring cells at time t is described by the following relations :
S i,t+1

where Qi, j is the population size inside the cell (i, j), N ∗ = N − {(0, 0)} and v is the virulence of the disease.
The parameter ε ∈ [0, 1] is the recovery rate which is assumed to be constant. σ ∈ [0, 1] stands for the portion of
exposed individuals which become infectious. 1/σ and 1/ε are the average exposed (latent) period and infected
i, j
period respectively. di+α,
j+β is called the distance impact factor of the cells (i, j) and (i + α, j + β) [7, 8]. It allows
to describe the inﬂuence of the distance in the disease spreading. This factor is deﬁned as follows:

In order to study the behaviour of the proposed model and the eﬀect of the neighborhood choice on the disease
spreading, we will implement the model with arbitrary parameters for two neighborhoods of diﬀerent shapes but
the same size. Another analysis of the spreading eﬀect of epidemics will concern the estimation of the basic
reproduction number for each situation. We ﬁrst consider a traditional Moore neigborhood N of size n = 9 and
then split it in two parts N1 which is von Neumann of zise n1 = 5 and N2 consisting of n − n1 = 4 arbitrarily
dispatched cells in the whole lattice L.
3. Model study
3.1. Basic reproduction number with traditional neighborhood
Since every point (S , E, I, R) with I = 0 is an equilibrium, the system described by the equations (1), (2), (3)
and (4) has a inﬁnite set of equilibrium solutions. So we wont be able to use the next generation approach nor any

2605

B. Ciss´e et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2603 – 2606

similar method to ﬁnd the basic reproduction number since the generated linearization matrix at each equilibrium
has a zero eigenvalue. For this reason, we opted for the approach considered by White et al. [1] for SIR model,
which seems to be more appropriate to estimate R0 .
We suppose that in the initial conﬁguration there is only one cell denoted by (i, j), with infected individuals,
and let (i, j + 1) be its north neighboring cell. Then, using the fact that Ii0, j+1 = Ei,0 j+1 = 0 and S i,0 j+1 = 1, the portion
of infected individuals at time t = 1 is given by the following expression:
Q
Ei,1 j+1 = Qi,i,j+1j .di,i, jj+1 .v.IIi0, j
where Qi, j , Qi, j+1 , di,i, jj+1 and v are the population size inside the cell (i, j), the population size inside the cell
(i, j + 1), the distance impact factor of the cells (i, j) and (i, j + 1), and the virulence of the disease respectively.
There will be infected individuals in the cell (i, j + 1) at time t = 1 if Ei,1 j+1 ≥ 0.01. As a consequence, there are
the outbreak of the disease if:
Qi, j+1
Ii0, j ≥
i, j+1
100.Qi, j .di, j .v

In the homogeneous case where the population size is constant for every cell (i, j), ρ =

1
100.di,i, jj+1 .v

will denote

the minimal number of infected individuals which allows the epidemic to expand out of a cell (i, j).
If we start from Ii0, j < ρ and for decreasing quantities Iit, j and Ei,t j as functions of t, theire is no spreading of the
disease and the number of infected individuals tends to zero. Therefore, equations (2), (3) which are now written
as :

As a result, the disease will be eradicated when R0 < 1 while it spreads from the main cell to its neighbors if
R0 > 1 [1, 4].
3.2. Simulations results
The simulations were performed in a two-dimensional array of 50 × 50 cells. The population size at each
cell is assumed to be constant Qi, j = Q . The considered parameters are v = 0.6, ε = 0.4, Q = 100, σ =
0.7. We represent the proportion of infected individuals (E t + I t ) of each cell and at time t by means of a gray
level code running from white color for the value 0 to black color for value 1. Starting from an initial seed
consisting of a single central cell with infected individuals, located at (25, 25) whose initial state is given by s025,25 =
(0.6, 0.2, 0.2, 0). The considered neighborhood N of each cell will be composed of a traditional neighborhood N1
and a random neighborhood N2 such that N = N1 ∪ N2 .

.
To study the impact of the neighborhood on the epidemic spreading, we simulate ﬁrst, the evolution of both
the maximum peak value of infected individuals (composed by the exposed and infectious individuals) and the
peak instant value in terms of R0 with Moore neighborhood. Then we modify the structure of the neighborhood
as is mentioned above and compare the obtained results.

2606

In Fig. 2, we present the evolutions of the peak maximum value and peak instant with Moore and Modiﬁed
neighborhoods in order to give a comparison result.

Fig. 2. (a) Evolution of average maximum peak value of infected individuals for diﬀerents values of R0 with Moore and Modiﬁed neighborhoods; (b) Evolution of peak instant of infected individuals for diﬀerents values of R0 with Moore and Modiﬁed neighborhoods.

For the same number of neighbors the results are really diﬀerents. In fact, with the modiﬁed neiborhood, the
peak maximum value of infected individuals is more important and happens more quickly than in the case with
Moore neighborhood. This diﬀerent is due to the spatial distribution of the neighbors in the lattice.
So our deﬁnition of R0 with the traditional neighborhood (that is the same in many papers [1, 9, 10]) is not
really adequate for every kind of neighborhoods even if they have the same size. As a consequence, the expression
of basic reproduction number have to be revisited in order to take into account the structure of the neighborhood.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a model based on the standard SEIR model where a term describing the impact
of the neighborhood structure was added. We have determined the value of the key parameter R0 which allows to
predict the temporal evolution of a disease in a population. Here we study the inﬂuence of neighborhood shape on
the disease spread via the basic reproduction number.
Using the SEIR CA model, we have shown that the spatial distribution of the cells in the neighborhood have a
real inﬂuence on the disease spreading. It allows the increasing of the maximum peak value of infected individuals
and the decreasing of the time when the maximum peak occurs. As a consequence it aﬀects the basic reproduction
number. This is simular to the result obtained in [10] where ordinary diﬀerential equations have been used for
modelling epidemic spreding. We can then suggest that an accurate estimate of R0 have to take into account some
parameters related to the neighborhood structure as for instance the distance impact factor. That will be considered
in a futur work.
