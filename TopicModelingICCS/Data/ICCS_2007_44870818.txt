Introduction

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an innovative computational ﬂuid
dynamics (CFD) approach for simulating ﬂuid ﬂows and modeling complex
physics in ﬂuids [1]. Compared with the conventional CFD approach, the LBM
is easy for programming, intrinsically parallel, and it is also easy to incorporate complicated boundary conditions such as those in porous media. The LBM
also shows potentials to simulate the nonlinear systems, including reactiondiﬀusion equation [2,3,4], convection-diﬀusion equation [5,6], Burgers equation
[7] and wave equation [3,8], etc. Recently, a generic LB model for advection
and anisotropic dispersion equation was proposed [9]. However, almost all of the
existing LB models are used for real nonlinear systems. Beginning in the mid
1990s, based on quantum-computing ideas, several types of quantum lattice gases
have been studied to model some real/complex mathematical-physical equations,
such as Dirac equation, Schr¨
odinger equation, Burgers equation and KdV equation [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. Although these work are not in the classical LBM
framework, they bring us an interesting problem: how does the classical LBM
work when used to model complex equations? Very recently, Linhao Zhong, Shide
Feng, Ping Dong, et al. [18] applied the LBM to solve one-dimensional nonlinear
Schr¨
odinger (NLS) equation using the idea of quantum lattice-gas model [13,14]
for treating the reaction term. Detailed simulation results in Ref.[18] have shown
that the LB schemes proposed have accuracy that is better than or at least comparable to the Crank-Nicolson ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme. Therefore, it is necessary
to study the LBM for nonlinear complex equations further.

In this paper, using the idea of adopting complex-valued distribution function
and relaxation time [18], the LBM for n-dimensional (nD) convection-diﬀusion
equation (CDE) with source term is applied directly to solve some important
nonlinear complex equations, including nonlinear Schr¨
odinger (NLS) equation,
coupled NLS equations, Klein-Gordon (KG) equation and coupled Klein-GordonSchr¨
odinger (CKGS) equations. Detailed simulations of these equations are
carried out for accuracy test. Numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions, which show that the LBM is also an eﬀective numerical solver for
complex nonlinear systems.

Lattice Boltzmann Model

The nD CDE with source term considered in this paper can be written as
∂t φ + ∇ · (φu) = α∇2 φ + F (x, t),

(1)

where ∇ is the gradient operator with respect to the spatial coordinate x in
n dimensions. φ is a scalar function of time t and position x. u is a constant
velocity vector. F(x,t) is the source term. When u=0, Eq.(1) becomes the diffusion equation (DE) with source term, and several of such equations form a
reaction-diﬀusion system (RDS).
2.1

LB Model for CDE

The LB model for Eq.(1) is based on the DnQb lattice [1] with b velocity directions in nD space.
The evolution equation of the distribution function in the model reads
1
fj (x+cj Δt, t+Δt)−fj (x, t) = − (fj (x, t)−fjeq (x, t))+ΔtFj (x, t), j = 0, . . . , b−1,
τ
(2)
where {cj , j = 0, . . . , b − 1} is the set of discrete velocity directions, Δx and Δt
are the lattice spacing and the time step, respectively, c = Δx/Δt is the particle
speed, τ is the dimensionless relaxation time, and fieq (x, t) is the equilibrium
distribution function which is determined by
fjeq (x, t) = ωj φ(1 +

cj · u (uu) : (cj cj − c2s I)
+
)
c2s

(3)

such that
j

fj =

fjeq = φ,

j

cj fjeq = φu,

cj cj fjeq = c2s φI + φuu

(4)

with α = c2s (τ − 12 )Δt, where I is the unit tensor, ωj are weights and cs , so called
sound speed in the LBM for ﬂuids, is related to c and ωj . They depend on the
lattice model used.
For the D1Q3 model, ω0 = 2/3, ω1∼2 = 1/6, for the D2Q9 one, ω0 =
4/9, ω1∼4 = 1/9, ω5∼8 = 1/36, then c2s = c2 /3 for both of them.

820

Fj in Eq.(2), corresponding to the source term in Eq.(1), is taken as
cj · u
Fj = ωj F (1 + λ 2 )
cs
such that

Fj = F,

cj Fj = λF u, where λ is a parameter which is set to

in the paper. It is found that the LB model using this setting has better
be
numerical accuracy and stability when u = 0.
The macroscopic equation (1) can be derived though the Chapman-Enskog
expansion (See Appendix for details). It should be noted that the equilibrium
distribution function for above LBM was often used in linear form of u, which
is diﬀerent from that in Eq.(3). However, from the appendix we can see that
some additional terms in the recovered macroscopic equation can be eliminated
if Eq.(3) is used. Moreover, if u is not constant, the appropriate assumption on
it is needed in order to remove the additional term(s) when recovering Eq.(1).
2.2

Version of LB Model for Complex CDE

Almost all of the existing LB models simulate the real evolutionary equations.
However, from the Chapman-Enskog analysis, we can ﬁnd that the functions in
CDE and related distribution function can be both real and complex without
aﬀecting the results. In general, for the complex evolutionary equations, let us
decompose the related complex functions and relaxation time into their real and
imaginary parts by writing
1
= w1 + iw2 ,
τ

(6)

gj (x + cj Δt, t + Δt) − gj (x, t) = − w1 (gj (x, t) − gjeq (x, t))
+w2 (hj (x, t) − heq
j (x, t)) + ΔtGj (x, t),
hj (x + cj Δt, t + Δt) − hj (x, t) = − w2 (gj (x, t) − gjeq (x, t))
−w1 (hj (x, t) − heq
j (x, t)) + ΔtHj (x, t),
j = 0, . . . , b − 1.

(7)

fj = gj + ihj , fjeq = gjeq + iheq
j , Fj = Gj + iHj , w =
where i2 = −1.
Now we can rewrite Eq.(2) as

Eq.(7) is the implemental version of the LB model proposed for complex CDE.
It should be noted that Eq.(7) reﬂects the coupling eﬀect of real and imaginary parts of unknown function in complex CDE through the complex-valued
relaxation time in a natural way.

Simulation Results

To test the LB model proposed above, numerical simulations of some CDEs
with source term are carried out. Here we select three types of complex nonlinear
evolutionary equations with analysis solutions to test mainly the numerical order
of accuracy of the LBM. In simulations, the initial value of distribution function
is taken as that of its equilibrium part at time t = 0, which is a commonly used

strategy, and Δx2 /Δt(= Δx × c) is set to be constant for diﬀerent grids due to
some claims that LB schemes are second-order accurate in space and ﬁrst-order
accurate in time.
Example 3.1. We show an accuracy test for the 2D NLS equation
iut + uxx + uyy + β|u|2 u = 0,

(8)

which admits a progressive plane wave solution [19]
u(x, y, t) = A exp(i(c1 x + c2 y − ωt)),

(9)

where ω = c21 + c22 − β|A|2 ; A, c1 and c2 are constants.
In simulations, a D2Q9 LB model is used. We set A = c1 = c2 = 1, β = 2
and use the periodic boundary condition is used in [0, 2π] × [0, 2π] as in Ref.[19],
while the initial condition for u is determined by the analytical solution (9) at
t = 0. The global relative L1 error and the numerical order of accuracy are
contained in Table 1 at time t = 1. From the table we can see that the LBM
for the NLS equation (8) has about second-order of accuracy, but the order of
accuracy decreases as the resolution increases.

Example 3.2. We show an accuracy test for the 1D coupled NLS equation
iut + iαux + 12 uxx + (|u|2 + β|v|2 )u = 0,

− a; a, γ, α and β are real constants.

We can use two LB evolutionary equations based on D1Q3 lattice to simulate
Eq.(10). We set a = 1, γ = 1, α = 0.5, β = 2/3 and use the periodic boundary
condition in [−25, 25] as in Ref.[19], while the initial condition is determined by
the analytical solution (11) at t = 0. The global relative L1 errors are plotted
in Fig. 1 (left) at time t = 1 for Δx = 1/10 to 1/320, and c = 20 to 640. It is
found that the LBM for the coupled NLS equations (10) has the second-order

of accuracy, and the order of accuracy is nearly ﬁxed to 2.0 for diﬀerent grid
resolution. To test the LBM further the error evolution with time is also plotted
in Fig.1 (right) for Δx = 1/100, and Δt = 10−4 and 10−5 , respectively. The
errors for Δt = 10−4 are about 7.0 to 9.0 times those for Δt = 10−5 .

(13)

where v is the propagating velocity of wave and x0 is the initial phase.
Note that the KG equation in Eq.(12) is diﬀerent from RD equation, the
special case of Eq.(1), due to the second time diﬀerential of φ. In order to solve
this equation by LBM, we must modify the LB model in section 2.
Consider the nD KG equation
φtt − α∇2 φ + V (φ) = 0,

(14)

in the spacial region Ω, where V (φ) is some nonlinear function of φ. The the
initial conditions associated with Eq.(14) are given by
φ(x, 0) = f (x), φt (x, 0) = g(x),

(15)

where the boundary conditions can be found according to the given problem.
Using the idea in Ref.[8], we modify Eq.(3) as follows
fjeq (x, t) = ωj (φt +
= ωj (φt +

(17)

with α = c2s (τ − 12 )Δt. We use the diﬀerence scheme for computing φt to obtain
φ. For instance, φ(x, t + Δt) = Δt j fj (x, t + Δt) + φ(x, t).
Now we can use two LB evolutionary equations based on D1Q3 lattice to
simulate Eq.(12), one for NLS equation and the other for KG equation. In simulation, the initial and boundary conditions are determined by the analytical
solution (13) in [−10, 10]. The non-equilibrium extrapolation scheme [21] is used
for treating the boundary conditions. The global relative L1 errors are also plotted in Fig. 1 (left) for v = 0.8, x0 = 0 at time t = 1 for Δx = 1/10 to 1/640, and
c = 10 to 640. It is found that the LBM for the coupled KGS equations (12) has
also the second-order of accuracy, which is comparable to the multisymplectic
scheme in Ref.[20]. We also ﬁnd that the order of accuracy for φ increases from
1.7308 to 2.0033 as the grid resolution increases. This may be because that we
use the ﬁrst-order diﬀerence scheme to compute φt .

Conclusion

In this paper the LBM for nD CDE with source term has been applied directly
to solve some important nonlinear complex equations by using complex-valued
distribution function and relaxation time, and the LB model for nD KG equation
is derived by modifying the method for CDE. Simulations of 2D NLS equation,
1D coupled NLS equations and 1D coupled KGS equations are carried out for
accuracy test. Numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions and
the second-order accuracy of the LBM is conﬁrmed. We found that to attain
better accuracy the LBM for the test problems requires a relatively small time
step Δt and Δt = 10−4 is a proper choice. Since the Chapman-Enskog analysis
shows that this kind of complex-valued LBM is only the direct translation of the
classical LBM in complex-valued function, the LBM can be applied directly to
other complex evolutionary equations or real ones with complex-valued solutions.
Although the preliminary work in this paper shows that the classical LBM has
also potentials to simulate complex-valued nonlinear systems, some problems still
need to be solved, such as how to improve the accuracy and eﬃciency of complex
LBM and that how does the complex LBM for CDE work when u is not constant.
