Abstract. Ground state geometries and electronic properties of four
experimentally reported spirosilabifluorene derivatives are calculated by
HF(DFT)/6-31G* method. Their first excited state geometries are investigated
using CIS/6-31G* method. The absorption and emission spectra are evaluated by
TD-B3LYP/6-31G* and show an excellent agreement with the experimental
data. The “CH”/N substituted spirosilabifluorene derivatives are also
investigated. Compared to the pristine molecule, no significant change of the
emission wavelengths are found for the “CH”/N substituted derivatives.
Furthermore, we find that the performance and the optical properties of these
derivatives can be improved through oligomerization or addition of a phenyl
group.
Keywords: spirosilabifluorene, TD-DFT, HF, emission, oscillator strength.

1 Introduction
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been the subjects of intensive
investigation, since they were reported by Tang et al. [1] The major challenges remain,
including the need to develop a blue electroluminescence emitter material, which is
essential for the development of a full color display based on the color changing medium
technology or white emission. [2, 3] OLEDs based on silicon derivatives exhibit
excellent performance with external electroluminescence quantum efficiencies close to
the theoretical limit for a fluorescent material. [4] Compared with spirobifluorene,
spirosilabifluorene may have an improved morphological stability in films.[5] They
have also been extensively studied as charge transport materials, and the frontier
molecular orbitals give the main contribution to charge-transfer interactions. [6, 7]
Recently, a series of aryl-substituted 9,9’-spiro-9-silabifluorene (SSF) derivatives,
2,2’-di-tert-butyl-7,7’-diphenyl-9,9’-spiro-9-silabifluorene (1a), 2,2’-di-tert-butyl-7,7’
-dipyridin-2-yl-9,9’-spiro-9-silabifluorene (1b), 2,2’-di-tert-butyl-7,7’-diphenyl-4-yl9,9’-spiro-9-silabifluorene (1c), and 2,2’-di-tert-butyl-7,7’-bis(2,2’-bipyridin-6-yl)-9,
9’- spiro-9-silabifluorene (1d) were prepared by Lee et al.[4] The absorption spectrum
of each of the novel spiro-linked siloles was found showing a significant red shift
relative to that of the corresponding carbon analogue. [8] The corresponding solid-state
films were reported to exhibit intense violet-blue emission (λPL = 398-415 nm).

In this contribution, we have investigated the optical and electronic properties of
spirosilabifluorene derivatives (1a-1d) with the aim to give a further explanation of the
experimental results, and then design new photoluminescence materials based on
selected approaches for spirosilabifluorene based materials. “CH”/N substitution
approach, which has been cited as an efficient approach for tuning of the emitting color
in the case of Mq3 (M = Al, [9, 10] Ga [9] and q = 8-hydroxyquinoline) based
fluorescent materials, has not exploited yet in the case of spirosilabifluorene based
materials. Thus, “CH”/N substituted spirosilabifluorene derivatives are investigated.
With the aim to investigate the ending groups for enhancing the oscillator strength (f),
we design the derivatives with and without t-Bu and phenyl groups.

2 Computational Details
The structures of spirosilabifluorene derivatives (1a-1d) and the designed derivatives
were provided in Figure 1. For the sake of comparison, spirosilabifluorene (SSF) was
used as parent molecule. Two SSF derivatives with phenyl (1e) and t-Bu (1f) groups
were chosen to investigate the ending group effect on f. The other substituted models
used in our calculations, obtained by a systematic substitution of “CH” by N atoms on
positions 4, 5, 6, and 7, were labeled as shown (see Figure 1(II)). The 4-, 5-, 6-,
7-di-substituted compounds on both A and B moieties were considered for 2a-2d,
respectively. The 4,4’-, 5,5’-, 6,6’-, 7,7’-C-substituted compounds (3a-3d) were
considered for di-substitution on the same A moiety of SSF. Furthermore, the dimeric
form of 3d was listed in Figure 1(III).

All the geometry optimizations for the ground state (S0) were performed using the ab
initio Hartree Fock (HF) [11] and the B3LYP [12] method with the 6-31G* [13] basis
set. The low-lying excited-state (S1) structures were then optimized using the
configuration interaction with single excitations (CIS) [14] with 6-31G* basis set, the
optical spectra was calculated using TD-B3LYP [15] with 6-31G* basis set to obtain
estimates including some account of electron correlation. All the calculations have
been performed using Gaussian 03 package. [16]

3 Results and Discussions
3.1 Comparison of Computational Methods and Optical Characteristics for
1a-1d
3.1.1 Geometries of Ground States
More detailed insights into the nature of the excited states responsible for the optical
properties can be gained by looking at the computed frontier molecular orbitals
(FMOs), when calculated on a reliable molecular geometry. The optimized structures
for 1a-1d show that the bond lengths and bond angles do not suffer from appreciable
variation, according to different calculation methods. These derivatives keep their
mutually perpendicular π-systems, and the torsion angles within silafluorene fragment
are less than 1°. Apparently, the major differences are related to the torsion angles
between substituents and the silafluorene fragments, according to HF and B3LYP
results. The dihedral angles between silafluorene fragment and the phenyl/pyridyl
substituents are 44°/26° (1a/1b) at HF level, and 37°/17° (1a/1b) at B3LYP level. This
indicates that the hydrogen-free pyridine ring twists less than the phenyl group. Note
that the lowest energy conformer for bipyridyl has the nitrogen atoms in a
trans-conformation. The dihedral angles between the outer and inner aryl rings for
biphenyl and bipyridyl substituents are -45° (1c) and 4°(1d) at HF level, while -37° (1c)
and 3° (1d) at the B3LYP level. Therefore, the twisting for the backbone in 1b and 1d
are reduced as compared with 1a and 1c.
3.1.2 Absorption Properties
To investigate the effect of electron correlation on the computed energies and spectra,
calculations using TD-B3LYP method, are carried out based on both the HF/6-31G*
and B3LYP/6-31G* optimized S0 geometries. For the sake of comparison, and to
estimate the accuracy of the theoretical level applied in this work, we listed both the
experimental [4] and theoretical [17] maximum absorption wavelengths (λabs) for 1a-1d
in Table 1. From these results, one may find that the calculated λabs values at
TD-B3LYP//HF/6-31G* level are in excellent agreement with experimental results,
with less than 7 nm of deviation. These give credit to the computational approach, and
reliable geometries may be predicted from this level, which can be applied to the
system under investigation. Our results indicates that λabs do not change significantly in
1a-1d (within the range of 314-322 nm), with only a slight blue shift being found in 1a,
and while 1b-1d are nearly identical.

optimized S0 geometries;

3.1.3 Excited States Structures
Comparing with the ground states structures, some of the bonds in excited states
equilibrium geometries are lengthened, some others being shortened. All of the
significant changes are located on one of the two identical (A or B) moieties, the other
one remaining practically unaffected. The central silole ring is revealed to be the most
distorted with the C2-C3 and C2’-C3’ bond lengths being lengthened by ca 0.06 Å upon
excitation. The S1 optimized C3-C3’ bond lengths in the range from 1.40 to 1.41 Å, are
found to be shortened by ca 0.09 Å compared with their corresponding S0 states. The
dihedral angles between the silafluorene fragment and the phenyl/biphenyl rings
decrease for 1a and 1c in the S1 states. According to the very small torsion angles (≤ 1°)
between the ortho-hydrogen-free pyridine and the silafluorene fragment for 1b and 1d
in S1 states, effectively coplanar configurations allow better π orbital overlap.
Moreover, these molecules maintain their two mutually perpendicular π–systems in S1
states.
3.1.4 Emission Properties
In Table 1, we summarize the calculation results for the first singlets excitation energies
with the corresponding oscillator strengths based on TD-B3LYP//CIS/6-31G* level.
The results show that, comparatively to 1a and 1b, λem red-shifted by 10 nm with an
intense violet-blue emission wavelength at 397 nm, in excellent agreement with the
experimental data. The energy gaps of 1a, 1b, and 1d do not change significantly
(within the range of 3.60-3.55 eV), compared with that of 1c (3.48eV). This is
consistent with the slight red shift of 1c, and the nearly identical wavelengths of 1a, 1b
and 1d. The oscillator strength of 1c is twice larger than the others. This may be due to
the efficient conjugation from the external phenyl group in S1 by decreasing the
torsional angles between the external and inner phenyl rings, corresponding to some
amount of orbital distribution from the external ring (see Figure 2). It also leads to a

red-shifted wavelength for 1c. On the other hand, the pyridine and bipyridyl ring in 1b
and 1d have no significant influence on λem compared with 1a, which is consistent with
the FMO patterns in S1 for 1a, 1b, and 1d. FMOs are only mainly located on the
silafluorene fragments and their adjacent aryl rings, the external aryl rings faily
contributing to them (see Figure 2).

1a-1d

3.1.5 Oscillator Strength
To investigate the role of the aryl substituent, we carried out the same calculations for
SSF, 1e, and 1f. From the results listed in Table 1, one can find that the predicted f
values are in the increasing order 1f < 1e < 1a for both absorption and emission results.
The oscillator strength of 1e (with the bulky aromatic substituent) are close to that of 1a
(with both the aryl and t-Bu substituent), compared with t-Bu substituted derivatives 1f.
Thus, it can be concluded that phenyl group plays a very important role in enlarging the
oscillator strength.
3.2 Optimized Geometries and Optical Properties for the “CH”/N Substituted
Derivatives
3.2.1 Optimized Geometries of S0 and S1 States
In general, the optimization results in S0 do not reveal any significant change on the
geometry of the skeleton of the parent molecule (SSF), when substituting “CH” by N.
In all the cases, the silafluorene fragments maintain their mutually perpendicular
π–systems. Compared with the skeleton of SSF, the bond lengths and bond angles
change mainly on the nitrogen and its neighboring carbon atoms. The C-N bond lengths
are predicted to be ca. 1.321 Å, the C-C-N and N-C-C angles being larger (by ca 1.32 5.40°) than the corresponding C-C-C angle in SSF. However, the C-N-C bond angles
become smaller (by ca 2.76 - 4.48 °) than the corresponding C-C-C ones in SSF. The
optimization results for S1 states possess the same feature as 1a-1d, upon S0-S1
transition, the main is localized on one of the two identical (A or B) moieties, the other
parts remaining practically unaffected.

3.2.2 Emission Properties
Figure 3 shows the electronic density contours of the FMOs for SSF, 2a, and 3a in S1
states as representatives of systems under investigation. Both the HOMO and LUMO
spread over π-conjugated backbone as those for 1a-1d. They are respectively antibonding
and bonding between the carbon atoms bridging the two phenyl groups within the
silafluorene fragment for HOMOs and LUMOs. The same bonding-antibonding pattern
is also observed between adjacent atoms in the same aryl ring.

(lower panel) for spirosilabifluorene, 2a and 3a

The calculated emission wavelengths (λem), the oscillator strength (f), the transition,
corresponding assignment, and the main CI expansion of the derivatives of interest are
listed in Table 2. For all “CH”/N substituted derivatives, emitting states are mainly of
LUMO→HOMO character. As there is a slight change for the energy gaps (Eg)
between HOMO and LUMO for the investigated system, slight change can be also
found for λem, with the maximum change being 13 nm (in 2c and 3d).

3.3 Optical Property for Dimer
It is believed that larger f can also be reached in the case of oligomers. Moreover, both
absorption and emission wavelengths will be red-shifted in the case of oligomers. [18]
In this work, we considered the dimeric form of 3d through positions 6 and 6’ (shown in
Figure 1(III)). On the basis of the same approach, the λabs values for the first three states
are predicted to be 346 nm (f = 0.0000), 346 nm (f = 0.0072) and 329 nm (f = 0.6828),
respectively, in comparison with 3d, whose λabs corresponding to the first three sates are

325

328 nm (f = 0.000), 323 nm (f = 0.000) and 307 nm (f = 0.000), it becomes clear that
both λabs and f are increased in the dimeric form. The λem values for the first three
excited states are predicted to be 405 nm (f = 1.184), 395 nm (f = 0.000) and 395 nm
(f = 0.008), respectively, while those of 3d are 380 nm (f = 0.000), 373 nm (f = 0.012)
and 353 nm (f = 0.042). It can be found that both λabs/λem and f are increased in the
dimmer form. In general, larger oscillator strengths correspond to the intensive
fluorescent emitting, therefore, this approach may contribute to develop the property of
emitting materials.

4 Conclusions
Calculations have been performed on a novel class of spirosilabifluorene and some of
its derivatives. Some light is shed on a series of experimentally available derivatives
and “CH”/N on substituted derivatives. Our calculation results on 1a-1d are in good
agreement with experimental results. The similar optical properties for 1a-1d are
ascribed to the identical FMO distribution pattern and similar energy gaps between
FMOs. Compared to the pristine molecule, no significant change of emission
wavelengths is found for the “CH”/N substituted derivatives. According to our results,
phenyl group and oligomers may play a very important role in enlarging the oscillator
strengths, which will increase the fluorescent intensity. Thus, we may be improved the
emitting properties by adding the aryl substituents or oligomerization. Furthermore, the
dimeric forms of the designed “CH”/N substituted derivatives are expected to be
promising candidate for blue emitting materials.
