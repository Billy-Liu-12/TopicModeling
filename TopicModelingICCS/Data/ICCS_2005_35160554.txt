Introduction

In ﬁnancial markets, the investment strategies can be divided into two classes:
passive investment strategies and active investment strategies. Investors who
are adopting active investment strategies carry out securities exchange actively
so that they can ﬁnd proﬁt opportunity constantly. Active investors take it
for granted that they can beat markets continuously. Investors who are adopting passive investment strategies consider that the securities market is eﬃcient.
Therefore they cannot go beyond the average level of market continuously. Index
tracking investment is a kind of passive investment strategy, i.e., investors purchase all or some securities which are contained in a securities market index and
construct an index tracking portfolio. The securities market index is considered
as a benchmark. The investors want to obtain a similar return as that of the
benchmark through the index tracking investment.
In 1952, Markowitz [6, 7] proposed the mean variance methodology for portfolio selection. It has served as a basis for the development of modern ﬁnancial
theory over the past ﬁve decades. Konno and Yamazaki [5] used the absolute
deviation risk function to replace the risk function in Markowitz’s model to formulate a mean absolute deviation portfolio optimization model. Roll [8] used

the sum of the squared deviations of returns on a replicating portfolio from
benchmark as the tracking error and proposed a mean variance index tracking
portfolio selection model. Clarke, Krase and Statman [2] deﬁned a linear tracking error which is the absolute deviation between the managed portfolio return
and the benchmark portfolio return. Based on the linear objective function in
which absolute deviations between portfolio and benchmark returns are used,
Rudolf, Wolter and Zimmermann [9] proposed four alternative deﬁnitions of a
tracking error. Furthermore, they gave four linear optimization models for index tracking portfolio selection problem. Consiglio and Zenios [3] and Worzel,
Vassiadou-Zeniou and Zenios [11] studied the tracking indexes of ﬁxed-income
securities problem. In this paper, we will use the excess return and the linear
tracking error as objective functions and propose a bi-objective programming
model for the index tracking portfolio selection problem. Furthermore, we use
fuzzy numbers to describe investors’ vague aspiration levels for the excess return
and the tracking error and propose a fuzzy index tracking portfolio selection
model.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a bi-objective
programming model for the index tracking portfolio selection problem. In Section
3, regarding investors’ vague aspiration levels for the excess return and linear
tracking error as fuzzy numbers, we propose a fuzzy index tracking portfolio
selection model. In Section 4, a numerical example is given to illustrate the
behavior of the proposed fuzzy index tracking portfolio selection model. Some
concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

Bi-objective Programming Model for Index Tracking
Portfolio Selection

In this paper, we assume that an investor wants to construct a portfolio which is
required to track a securities market index. The investor allocates his/her wealth
among n risky securities which are component stocks contained in the securities
market index. We introduce some notations as follows.
rit : the observed return of security i (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) at time t (t = 1, 2, · · · , T );
xi : the proportion of the total amount of money devoted to security i (i =
1, 2, · · · , n);
It : the observed securities market index return at time t (t = 1, 2, · · · , T ).
Let x = (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ). Then the return of portfolio x at time t (t =
1, 2, · · · , T ) is given by
n

rit xi .

Rt (x) =
i=1

An excess return is the return of index tracking portfolio x above the return
on the index. The excess return of portfolio x at time t (t = 1, 2, · · · , T ) is given
by
Et (x) = Rt (x) − It .

The expected excess return of index tracking portfolio x is given by
T

E(x) =
t=1

1
(Rt (x) − It ) .
T

Roll [8] used the sum of squared deviations between the portfolio and benchmark returns to measure the tracking error of index tracking problem. Rudolf,
Wolter and Zimmermann [9] used linear deviations instead of squared deviations
to give four deﬁnitions of the linear tracking errors. We adopt the tracking error
based on the mean absolute downside deviations to formulate the index tracking
portfolio selection model in this paper. The tracking error based on the mean
absolute downside deviations can be expressed as
T

TDM AD (x) =
t=1

1
| min{0, Rt (x) − It }|.
T

Generally, in the index tracking portfolio selection problem, the track error
and the excess return are two important factors which are considered by investors. An investor tries to maximize the expected excess return. At the same
time, the investor hopes that the return of portfolio equals the return of the
index approximatively to some extent in the investment horizon. Hence, the expected excess return and the tracking error can be considered as two objective
functions of the index tracking portfolio selection problem.
In many ﬁnancial markets, the securities are no short selling. So we add the
following constraints:
x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, · · · , n.
We assume that the investor pursues to maximize the excess return of portfolio and to minimize the tracking error under the no short selling constraint.
The index tracking portfolio selection problem can be formally stated as the
following bi-objective programming problem:
(BP) max E(x)
min TDM AD (x)
n

s.t.
i=1

xi = 1,

x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, · · · , n.
The problem (BP) can be reformulated as a bi-objective linear programming
problem by using the following technique. Note that
min{0, a} =

1

a − a

for any real number a. Thus, by introducing auxiliary variables b+
t , bt , t =
1, 2, · · · , T such that

t + bt =

we may write

Hence, we may rewrite problem (BP) as the following bi-objective linear programming problem:

Thus the investor may get the index tracking investment strategies by computing
eﬃcient solutions of (BLP). One can use one of the existing algorithms of multiple
objective linear programming to solve it eﬃciently.

Fuzzy Index Tracking Portfolio Selection Model

In an investment, the knowledge and experience of experts are very important
in an investor’s decision-making. Based on experts’ knowledge, the investor may
decide his/her levels of aspiration for the expected excess return and the tracking
error of index tracking portfolio. In [10], Watada employed a non-linear S shape
membership function, to express aspiration levels of expected return and of risk
which the investor would expect and proposed a fuzzy active portfolio selection
model. The S shape membership function is given by:
f (x) =

1
.
1 + exp(−αx)

In the bi-objective programming model of index tracking portfolio selection
proposed in Section 2, the two objectives, the expected excess return and the
tracking error, are considered. Since the expected excess return and the tracking error are vague and uncertain, we use the non-linear S shape membership
functions proposed by Watada to express the aspiration levels of the expected
excess return and the tracking error.
The membership function of the expected excess return is given by
µE (x) =

1
,
1 + exp (−αE (E(x) − EM ))

where EM is the mid-point where the membership function value is 0.5 and αE
can be given by the investor based on his/her own degree of satisfaction for the

Remark1: αE and αT determine the shapes of membership functions µE (x)
and µT (x) respectively, where αE > 0 and αT > 0. The larger parameters αE
and αT get, the less their vagueness becomes.
According to Bellman and Zadeh’s maximization principle [1], we can deﬁne
λ = min {µE (x), µT (x)} .
The fuzzy index tracking portfolio selection problem can be formulated as follows:

µT (x) ≥ λ,

, then λ = 1+exp
Let η = log 1−λ
(−η) . The logistic function is monotonously
increasing, so maximizing λ makes η maximize. Therefore, the above problem
can be transformed to an equivalent problem as follows:

(FLP) max η
s.t. αE (E(x) − EM ) − η ≥ 0,
αT (TDM AD (x) − TM ) + η ≤ 0,
and all constraints of (BLP),
where αE and αT are parameters which can be given by the investor based on
his/her own degree of satisfaction regarding the expected excess return and the
tracking error.
(FLP) is a standard linear programming problem. One can use one of several
algorithms of linear programming to solve it eﬃciently, for example, the simplex
method.
Remark2: The non-linear S shape membership functions of the two factors may
change their shape according to the parameters αE and αT . Through selecting
the values of these parameters, the aspiration levels of the two factors may be
described accurately. On the other hand, diﬀerent parameter values may reﬂect
diﬀerent investors’ aspiration levels. Therefore, it is convenient for diﬀerent investors to formulate investment strategies by using the proposed fuzzy index
tracking portfolio selection model.

Numerical Example

In this section, we will give a numerical example to illustrate the proposed fuzzy
index tracking portfolio selection model. We suppose that the investor considers
Shanghai 180 index as the tracking goal. We choose thirty component stocks
form Shanghai 180 index as the risky securities. We collect historical data of the
thirty stocks and Shanghai 180 index from January, 1999 to December, 2002.
The data are downloaded from the web-site www.stockstar.com. We use one
month as a period to get the historical rates of returns of forty eight periods.
The values of the parameters αE , αT , EM and TM can be given by the
investor according his/her aspiration levels for the expected excess return and
the tracking error. In the example, we assume that αE = 500, αT = 1000,
EM = 0.010 and TM = 0.009. Using the historical data, we get an index tracking
portfolio selection strategy by solving (FLP). All computations were carried
out on a WINDOWS PC using the LINDO solver. Table 1 shows the obtained
expected excess return and tracking error of portfolio by solving (FLP). Table
2 shows the investment ratio of the obtained fuzzy index tracking portfolio.

Conclusion

Regarding the expected excess return and the tracking error as two objective
functions, we have proposed a bi-objective programming model for the index
tracking portfolio selection problem. Furthermore, investors’ vague aspiration
levels for the excess return and the tracking error are considered as fuzzy numbers. Based on fuzzy decision theory, we have proposed a fuzzy index tracking
portfolio selection model. An example is given to illustrate that the proposed
fuzzy index tracking portfolio selection model. The computation results show
that the proposed model can generate a favorite index tracking portfolio strategy according to the investor’s satisfactory degree.
