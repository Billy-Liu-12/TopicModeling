Abstract
This article takes a comprehensive look at the performance of Japanese Candlestick in forecasting equity
returns. We ﬁnd that Japanese Candlestick does provide predictive information in both in-sample (IS) and
out-of-sample (OOS) forecasts; and there is signiﬁcant information spillover from the U.S equity market to
the other markets. The results obtained are instructive to traders and portfolio managers but challenging to
academic claims.
Keywords:
Market Predictability, Japanese Candlestick, Upper and Lower Shadows

1. Introduction
Classical ﬁnancial economics argues the eﬃciency of ﬁnancial market in reﬂecting information and the unproﬁtability of charts. Although this argument is elegant and well-recognized, it
seems that it is not well-accepted by traders just by taking a look at the various charts widely
employed by traders to help read the markets minds.
Empirical investigations into the predictive power of technical indicators (also known as
charts) are huge, while the results depends. For example, Cowles (1993), Fama and Blume

(1966), and Jesen and Benington (1970) report little proﬁtable performance for a variety of popular technical indicators; Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2000) ﬁnd that several technical indicators
based on automatic pattern recognition with kernel regressions have practical value; and more
recently, Neely et al. (2010) report some technical indicators are closely related to the business
cycle and informative in predicting the level of the market risk premium.
Diﬀerent from the above mentioned empirical studies, we are interested in the forecasting
ability of the Japanese Candlestick in a predictive regression framework. We seek to answer
the questions that whether or not the Japanese Candlestick charts, which are clearly available
to investors, are providing valuable information for forecasting the equity returns by taking a
comprehensive look at the main global ﬁnancial markets2 .
2. Econometric Methodology
2.1. Forecast Construction
Adhering to the conventional framework for analyzing equity return predictability and the
suggestions of Xie and Wang (2011), we employ the following regression form:
n

m

rt+1 = α +

βi, j xi,t− j + εt+1 ,

(1)

i=1 j=0

where rt+1 is the return on a stock market index over period from time t to t+1, xi,t− j is a predictor
of interest, and εt+1 is a zero-mean disturbance term.
Conventionally, out-of-sample forecasts are generated in a dynamic way using an expanding
or a rolling window due to the usual argument of the instability of data generation process.
However, Xie and Wang (2011) ﬁnd that the stability of Japanese Candlestick for making outof-sample forecasts by using the static forecast procedure. To be speciﬁc, the total sample of T
observations for rt and xi,t are divided into two portions: the in-sample portion composed of the
ﬁrst m observations and the out-of-sample portion composed of the last n (n=T-m) observations.
The ﬁrst m observations are used to estimate the coeﬃcients α and βi, j
m

n

rˆt+1 = αˆ +

βˆ i, j xi,t− j ,

(2)

i=1 j=0

where αˆ and βˆ i, j are the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of α and βi, j , respectively. When
generating the static out-of-sample forecasts, the initial out-of-sample forecast of the stock return
is given by
m

n

rˆm+1 = αˆ +

βˆ i, j xi,m− j .

(3)

i=1 j=0

With the same αˆ and βˆ i, j , the next out-of-sample forecast is reported by
m+1 n

rˆm+2 = αˆ +

βˆ i, j xi,m+1− j .

(4)

i=1 j=0

2 Xie and Wang (2011) take the ﬁrst step investigating the Japanese Candlestick forecasting performance in the U.S
stock market and ﬁnd statistically and economically gains

Haibin Xie et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1219 – 1227

Proceeding in this manner through the end of the out-of-sample period, we generate a series
of n out-of-sample forecasts of the stock return. Static forecasts are structurally sensitive, any
critical structural changes, say a sharp increase in the βˆ i, j , will result in very poor out-of-sample
forecasts.
In the present paper, the predictors of interest are the components of Japanese Candlestick:
the upper and lower shadows. A typical Japanese Candlestick consists of two parts: real body and
shadow. Depending on the closing price and opening price, Japanese Candlestick is classiﬁed as
white candlestick and black candlestick. Figure 1 presents the charts of Japanese Candlestick.
We say a black candlestick appears if the opening price is over the closing price, otherwise, a
white candlestick comes out. Correspondingly, the upper shadow and lower shadow are deﬁned
as:
If Ct ≥ Ot ,
US t

=

LS t
RBt

= Ot − Lt ,
= Ct − Ot ,

Ht − Ct ,

US t

=

LS t
RBt

= C t − Lt ,
= Ot − Ct ,

otherwise,
Ht − Ot ,

where US t , LS t , RBt are the upper shadow, lower shadow and real body, respectively. Ht , Lt , Ot
and Ct are highest, lowest, opening and closing prices, respectively. Technical analysts believe
the upper and lower shadows are predictive and frequently use them to predict the future market
prices, see Nison (1991) and Morris (1992).
Instead of using the original Japanese Candlestick deﬁnitions, we employ the following definitions:
If Ct ≥ Ot ,
ust

=

log(Ht ) − log(Ct ),

lst

=

log(Ot ) − log(Lt ),

ust

=
=

log(Ht ) − log(Ot ),
log(Ct ) − log(Lt ).

otherwise,
lst

2.2. Forecast Evaluation
If forecasts do not capture any of the information contained in the real values, we would
expect that the slope λ of the following regressions will be zero.
rt = c + λˆrt + μt ,

(5)

where rt are the real stock returns and rˆt the forecasts, μ is an i.i.d noisy series of mean zero.
In case of statistically signiﬁcant nonzero of λ, we conclude the forecasts are informative. Put
it another way, predictive variables would generate informative forecasts. In case of c = 0 and
λ = 1, rˆt is said to be the unbiased forecasts of rt .

3. Empirical Results
3.1. Data Collection and Construction
To make a comprehensive look at the performance of the Japanese Candlestick, we collect
the monthly index data from the main open global ﬁnancial markets: FTSE100, DAX, CAC40
in Europe; NIKKEI225 (NK), HangSeng (HS) and Strait Times (ST) in Asia. Xie and Wang
(2011) have demonstrated that the Japanese Candlestick are informative in predicting the U.S
stock market. We also collect the U.S stock market price information for a diﬀerent purpose. We
want to know whether or not the U.S Japanese Candlestick will spillover to the other ﬁnancial
markets given the U.S market plays a leading role. The monthly data we collect from the U.S
market are the Standard and Poors 500 (S&P500) index data. For each month, four pieces of
information, opening, highest, lowest and closing, are reported3 . The data set is downloaded
from the ﬁnance subdirectory of the website “www.ﬁnance.yahoo.com”.
3.2. Regression Results
We perform both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. The in-sample forecasts span the
whole sample observations. When performing out-of-sample forecasts, the whole sample observations are divided into two portions. The last eleven years’ observations (2001.01-2011.08) are
used as out-of-sample forecasting tests, and the prior observations are employed to estimate the
coeﬃcients.
Predictors xi,t− j employed in this paper are upper and lower shadows. The predictors are
selected based on the following procedures: we ﬁrst calculate the cross correlations between
equity returns and shadows; shadows with the largest correlations and larger than 0.1 are used as
predictors.
Table 1 presents the in-sample regression estimates4 . Regression analysis demonstrates the
informativeness of Japanese Candlestick in predicting stock returns. What is notable is that there
is obvious information spillover from the U.S stock market to the remaining stock markets as the
upper shadow us sp is statistically signiﬁcant. All of Adjusted R2 s are more than 1% indicating
some kind of predictability of the stock returns. The high Adjusted R2 s of over 10% in DAX and
ST hint the high predictability in these two markets. Figure 2 gives a glimpse of the in-sample
forecasting results.
When performing out-of-sample regression estimates, the predictors are selected from the
in-sample ones and the results are presented in Table 2. Although some predictors present in
Table 1 disappear in Table 2, there does have some stable predictors appearing in both Tables 1
and 2. Notably, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant and stable information spillover from the U.S stock market
to DAX, CAC40 and ST stock markets. Figure 3 plots the out-of-sample forecasts of DAX,
CAC40, HK and ST. We don’t report the out-of-sample forecasts of FTSE100 and NK for the
consideration that Adjusted R2 =0. To some extent, Figure 3 demonstrates the out-of-sample
3 The data we collect have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent time-spans: FTSE spans 1984.04-2011.08; DAX spans 1990.122011.08; CAC40 spans 1990.03-2011.08; NK spans 1984.01-2011.08; HS spans 1987.01-2011.08; ST spans 1988.012011.08.
4 The notation ls (us ) denote the shadows calculated using data from market x, for example, if x represents FTSE100
x
x
then ls x represents lower shadow calculated using FTSE100 index; we use ∗, ◦ to represent signiﬁcance level: ∗ ∗ ∗ indicates signiﬁcance at 1%, ∗∗ indicates signiﬁcance at 5% and ∗ indicates signiﬁcance at 10%, ◦ indicates no signiﬁcance
at 10% level; notation t-k indicates how many lags are used as predictors.

forecasts well capture the ups and downs of the actual stock returns. The forecast evaluation

Although forecast evaluation results indicate biased out-of-sample forecasts, they do consolidate
the conclusion that rˆt are informative forecasts of rt given that the slope of each regression is
statistically signiﬁcant at a level of 5%. rˆt are informative forecasts of rt can be further demonstrated by trading strategy. Suppose there are two assets, cash and stock. The forecast trading
strategy is performed as follows: if out-of-sample forecasts are positive, we hold stock, otherwise
we hold cash. The ﬁnal wealth of buy-and-hold and forecast trading strategies are presented in
Figure 4. In all of these four cases, the forecast trading strategy demonstrates its advantage over
the simple buy-and-hold, conﬁrming that rˆt are informative forecasts of rt .

4. Conclusions
This paper takes a comprehensive look at the predictive information contained in the Japanese
Candlestick. Both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts indicate informativeness of the Japanese
Candlestick in forecasting stock returns. Also we ﬁnd the leading role of the U.S stock market

Haibin Xie et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1219 – 1227

in the global ﬁnancial markets. Our ﬁndings are valuable to not only portfolio management but
also risk management and challenging to the argument of market eﬃciency.
