Abstract. An implicit baroclinic unsteady three-dimensional model
(HIDROTAM3) which consists of hydrodynamic, transport and turbulence model
components, has been implemented to two real coastal water bodies namely,
Ölüdeniz Lagoon located at the Mediterranean coast and Bodrum Bay located at
the Aegean Sea coast of Turkey. M2 tide is the dominant tidal constituent for the
coastal areas. The flow patterns in the coastal areas are mainly driven by the wind
force. Model predictions are highly encouraging and provide favorable results.

1 Introduction
Coastal water bodies are generally stratified which may cause significant vertical and
lateral density gradients. In most of the real coastal water body applications, it is
necessary to predict the vertical structure of the flow due to these density gradients.
Similarly, the wind induced currents have a strong 3-D character, which require a
comprehensive 3-D numerical model. A three dimensional numerical model has been
developed to simulate the transport processes in coastal waters by the authors [1]. In
coastal water bodies such as estuaries, lagoons or bays, the horizontal length scale is
much larger than the vertical scale. The flow is predominantly horizontal and the vertical
acceleration is hardly compared with the gravity acceleration. The tidal range of the
Turkish Mediterranean Sea coast is small, the spring ranges being typically 20-30 cm.,
hence the dominant forcing for circulation and water exchange is due to the wind action.
In the literature, it is possible to find a large number of one, two and three dimensional
numerical models which have been used for the estimation of circulation patterns and
water quality in coastal water bodies [2], [3].

2 Application to Ölüdeniz Lagoon
With the developed three dimensional numerical model, the tidal circulation patterns are
investigated in Ölüdeniz Lagoon by using an input tidal wave with an amplitude of
a=0.15 m. and a period of T=12 hours 25 min [4]. Ölüdeniz Lagoon is located at the

Mediterranean coast of Turkey (Figure 1). Turkish coastline along the western
Mediterranean is increasingly being popular. Öludeniz Lagoon which is strategically
located along the sailing route, is busy almost all over the year. The town of Fethiye
located inland of the lagoon is one of the most developed coastal resorts along the
Turkish coastline. In order to prevent the excessive pollution, it is forbidden to enter the
lagoon waters by any motorboats. Simulation is started from the state of no motion at
the low tide when the water level is minimum everywhere in the lagoon, and the tidal
currents are zero. Then water level along the open sea boundary increases with respect
to a sinusoidal wave. Flow velocities are computed at 6 levels along the water depth.
The density of the water is assumed to be constant. The shoreline boundary is assumed
to be fixed. The horizontal square mesh size is constant, Dx=Dy=20 m. To simulate the
pollutant transport an inner mesh is fitted to the area as shown in Figure 2.
The propagation of the tidal wave is mainly affected by the geometric and
topographic conditions. The mean water depth at the entrance channel is around 3.5
m. and the width is around 60 m. Due to this narrow and shallow entrance, tidal
currents are damped out. Therefore the tidal velocities inside the lagoon are hardly
compared with the velocities around the entrance channel. The period of the tidal
wave, semi diurnal type, is so long that, the wave length is much larger than the
length of the coastal water body considered. Therefore the associated displacement of
the waters is essentially horizontal, resulting in nearly horizontal flows. The flow
directions at all layers are nearly the same.
Using the estimated tidal current patterns, the transport of a pollutant is also
simulated. For the simulation of the transport of pollutant discharged at the point
shown on Figure 2, the coliform count is used as the tracer. The initial concentration
is taken as 106 bac/ml at the discharge point and is assumed to be 1 bac/ml in the rest
of the lagoon waters. The discharge is assumed to take place steadily into the surface
layer and to start at the same time as the tidal action. It is assumed that the value of

the horizontal motion has an intensity, the Smagorinsky algebraic sub-grid scale
turbulence model is used to estimate the horizontal eddy viscosities. The distribution
of pollutant concentrations at the surface (from inner to outer contour in bac/ml is:
900000, 300000, 100000, 50000, 25000, 10000, 5000, 2500, 1000, 500, 250, 10) and
at the bottom (from inner to outer contour in bac/ml is: 10000, 5000, 2500, 1000, 500,
250, 10) layers are given hourly in Figure 3. It is seen that the progress of pollutant is
stabilized almost at 6 hours, and it covers the computational grid shown in the Fig. 2.
The pollutant concentration level at the bottom layers is about 10 times less than the
level at the surface layers.

3 Application to Bodrum Bay
Model has been applied to Bodrum Bay to simulate the circulation pattern and the
transport of pollutant. Bodrum Bay is located at the Aegean Sea coast of Turkey (Figure
1) where the dominant forcing for the water exchange is due to the wind action. The
town of Bodrum located inland of the Bay is one of the most developed coastal resorts
along the Agean Sea coast of Turkey. In Bodrum Bay, there are two sea outfalls
discharging directly into the Bay. The sea outfall at .Õ]ÕOEXUXQ KDV D OHQJWK RI  P

of 40 m.
The sea outfalls are shown in Figure 4 with a dotted line. The grid system used has a
square mesh size of 350x350 m. Near the sea outfall a more refined mesh with a grid size
of 50 m x 50 m. is fitted. The water depth is divided into 6 layers of equal thickness. In
the simulations of pollutant transport the coliform count is used as the tracer. The rate of
disappearance of pathogenic bacteria and viruses due to die-off approximately follows
first order kinetics. The die of constant kp, is computed in terms of T90, the time required
for 90 percent of the initial bacteria to die, and equals 2.3/T90.

For the coastal area wind shear is the dominant forcing that induce circulation. Wind
characteristics are obtained from the measurements of the meteorological station in
Bodrum for the period of 1990-2001. The wind analysis shows that the most critical wind

direction for wind speeds greater than 5 m/s, is the SSW direction. In the model
simulations, Bodrum Bay is subjected to a wind action with a speed of 8 m/s. blowing
from SSW. Simulation is started from a state of rest that, there is no water motion and
water surface is horizontal. The steady state is reached approximately 4 hours after from
the start of the wind action. The water density is taken constant. Horizontal eddy
viscosities are calculated by the sub-grid scale turbulence model and the vertical eddy

The steady state flow patterns near the surface and the bottom are sketched in Figure 4
and Figure 5 respectively. The transport of a pollutant is simulated using the coliform
count as the tracer. The initial concentration is taken as 106 bac/ml at the discharge point.
The discharge is assumed to take place steadily. T90 value is measured as 1.5 hours.
Distribution of pollutant concentrations at the surface and at the bottom layers are
showen in Figure 4 and in Figure 5 respectively. The area which has pollutant
concentrations over 103 bac/100 ml is a considerable area that includes the coastal band
width of 200 m.
Sea outfalls in Turkey must obey the regulations stated by the Turkish Water Pollution
Control Regulations [5]. Some of the regulatory norms are summarized here; a)The
initial dilution should not be less than 40 and preferably be more than 100; b)During the
summer season, T90 value should be taken at least equal to 2 hours for the Mediterranean
Sea and the Aegean Sea, and to 1.5 hours for the Black Sea; c) The total dilution should
be sufficient to yield less than 1000 total coliform per 100 ml for 90% of the time when
sampled in preserved areas of human contact within 200 m from the shoreline; d) The
minimum discharge depth should be 20m. If reaching this depth is impractical, then the
length of the discharge pipe, excluding the diffusor section, should not be less than 1300
m for waste water flow rates larger than 200 m3/day.

4 Conclusions
An implicit baroclinic 3-D numerical model developed to simulate the transport
processes in coastal waters is presented. Model is applied to Ölüdeniz Lagoon to
simulate the tidal circulation pattern and the dispersion of a pollutant discharged near
the lagoon entrance. Model predictions are encouraging for Ölüdeniz Lagoon that is a
type of chocked lagoon. Model predictions are also compared with the site
measurements, which are in good agreement with each other [6]. Model has been
applied to Bodrum Bay that there exist two sea outfalls discharging into the Bay. The
model with a great success simulates wind induced circulation pattern and the
pollutant diffusion. Presented 3-D model HIDROTAM3, can serve as a powerful
design tool and can be implemented in Decision Support Systems.
