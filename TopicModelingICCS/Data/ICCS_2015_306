Abstract
Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have predominantly focused on the association between
single SNPs and disease. It is probable, however, that complex diseases are due to combined effects of
multiple genetic variations, as opposed to single variations. Multi-SNP interactions, known as
epistatic interactions, can potentially provide information about causes of complex diseases, and build
on previous GWAS looking at associations between single SNPs and phenotypes. By applying
epistatic analysis methods to GWAS datasets, it is possible to identify significant epistatic
interactions, and map SNPs identified to genes allowing the construction of a gene network. A large
number of studies have applied graph theory techniques to analyse gene networks from microarray
data sets, using graph theory metrics to identify important hub genes in these networks. In this work,
we present a graph theory study of SNP and gene interaction networks constructed for a Clarkson
disease GWAS, as a result of applying epistatic interaction methods to identify significant epistatic
interactions. This study identifies a number of genes and SNPs with potential roles for Clarkson
disease that could not be found using traditional single SNP analysis, including a number located on
chromosome 5q previously identified as being of interest for capillary malformation.

1 Introduction
Technological progress in recent years has led to an increase in the amount and type of biological data
available for analysis. In particular, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data has been
widely used in studies to investigate the genetics of traits and diseases in humans. A SNP is a
difference in the individual nucleotide base between two DNA sequences, such as case and control
[1], and is the most commonly found genetic variation, occurring with a frequency of around 1 in
every 500-1,000 bases in the human genome [2]. SNPs have been linked to genome evolution,

familial traits, and complex and common diseases [3], including lung cancer [4], and high blood
pressure [5]. One approach for identifying SNPs associated with disease has been the use of Genome
Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of cases and controls. These studies have generally employed a
single step approach of testing each SNP with the trait of interest independently of the contribution of
other SNPs.
However, the common consensus is that instead of being caused by a single genetic variation,
complex diseases are caused by joint effects of multiple variations [6]. It has been noted that multiSNP epistatic interactions could potentially provide information about the causes of complex diseases,
and build on GWAS looking at associations between single SNPs and phenotypes [7]. The majority of
GWAS to date have identified genes with a relatively low genotype risk, suggesting that an alternative
approach is required in order to explain the missing heritability [8]. Epistatic interactions have been
associated with a number of diseases; these include prostate cancer [9], HIV-1 [10], and breast cancer
[11]. Here, we propose building on a previous dataset analysed using single SNP associations, by
applying epistatic interaction methods.
Due to the computational complexity involved in the calculation of epistatic interactions, a number
of previous studies have proposed reducing the data dimensionality by excluding SNPs based on an
individual genome-wide significance [12], [13]. Whilst these approaches also reduce the multiple
testing problem due to the resulting decrease in interactions, potentially significant interactions may
be removed as the two SNPs involved in a significant interaction may not pass the individual
threshold for significance. This is further highlighted by a studies that have identified solely SNP-SNP
interactions; the individual SNPs themselves having little or no effect [14]. To avoid the possibility of
excluding significant interactions, the complete dataset is retained by analysing it using an extended
version of the APPistatic pipeline [15], deployed on High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities at
the University of Malaga (UMA).
A number of network-based approaches have been advocated in systems biology to investigate the
relationship between phenotypes and genes [16], [17]. Furthermore, there have been a number of
studies that have applied these approaches to specifically investigate gene interactions in disease [18],
[19]. It is known that particular phenotypes/diseases arise due to the expression of various genes; it is
therefore of benefit to understand the behaviour of gene networks. Knowledge about gene network
pathways can assist in further understanding the biology of complex traits and diseases.
The SNP epistatic interactions can be modelled as a network, and graph theory centrality metrics
can be applied to identify hub SNPs. Mapping SNPs to genes allows the construction of a gene
network that can be analysed in the same way. For this study, the method is applied to a previously
published GWAS data set for Clarkson disease [20]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that
applies an epistatic analysis approach to this particular disease. Clarkson disease, also known as
Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome (SCLS), is a potentially fatal rare condition where the endothelial
cells lining the capillaries are believed to separate for a few days, leading to fluid leaking from the
circulatory system to the interstitial space, resulting in hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and
hemoconcentration [21]. This particular data set has been selected in order to demonstrate how
epistatic analysis can be applied to publically available datasets that have already been analysed for
single SNP association, to discover new potential genes of interest. In this paper, a number of hub
SNPs and genes are identified in the respective networks, suggesting that the implemented
methodology identifies important genes and SNPs associated with Clarkson disease, which can help
improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and highlight potential genetic biomarkers
of the disease.

2.1 Clarkson Disease GWAS
The dataset consists of samples from 12 individuals with Clarkson disease, and 18 healthy control
samples. The low number of samples is due to the scarceness of cases resulting from the rarity of the
disease. 4 of the patients were female, 8 male. In the control group, 8 were female and 10 male. All of
the patients were Caucasian, as per the typical demographic of Clarkson disease, as were 16 of the 18
individuals in the control group. Genotyping was carried out with Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human
Array 6.0 SNP chips. Quality control was carried out following the procedure employed in the highlycited 2007 WTCCC paper [22], resulting in 764,537 SNPs remaining in the dataset. Prior to
commencing the epistatic analysis of the dataset, single SNP association was carried out using the
software package PLINK [23]. Epistatic analysis was then carried out using the linear mixed model
based FaST-LMM [24], accessed via an extended version of APPistatic.

2.2 Epistatic Analysis
In order to calculate the epistatic interactions in the dataset, HPC facilities at UMA were used due to
the computationally complexity of the FaST-LMM method. Epistatic analysis took approximately
three days, and was split into 200 tasks deployed across 800 cores, each assigned 4GB RAM. In total
there were 2.92x1011 epistatic interactions in the dataset, of which 695 were significant due to having
a p-value < 1.71x10-13, as calculated by Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Interactions
between SNPs located within 1Mb of each other were discarded to remove potential false positives
due to linkage disequilibrium. This step was carried out as suggested by Wan et al [25]. A recent
study by Wood et al [26] noted apparent epistasis was due to the close location of the SNPs in the
interacting pair; highlighting the potential issue of false positives due to proximity, and the need for a
threshold.

2.3 SNP Interaction Network Construction and Analysis
Having uncovered epistatic SNP-SNP interactions of interest, the next step is the visualisation and
analysis of these interactions. This was carried out by importing the significant interactions as an edge
list into R, and using the network analysis library igraph [27]. The SNP interactions were then
exported to Cytoscape [28] for visualisation. Instead of one single network, there are a number of
disconnected smaller networks.
The most widely used network metric is the degree centrality that measures how many other nodes
a node in a network is connected to [29]. Two other widely used metrics are the closeness centrality,
and the betweenness centrality. The closeness centrality gives a measure of how close a node is to
other nodes in a network, with the distance measured as the shortest path between two nodes [29]. The
betweenness centrality measures how many shortest paths in a network pass through a node [30]. This
measures how important a node is in terms of controlling the flow of information in a network.
For the purposes of this study, the degree centrality metric will be used due to the disconnected
networks. Betweenness and closeness centrality are not appropriate, as the distance between nodes in
disconnected networks is infinite, as is the case here. Each SNP in the networks is ranked based on the
degree centrality score, with the top 20 ranked SNPs shown in Table 1, along with the closest proteincoding gene to the SNP.

2.4 Gene Interaction Network Construction and Analysis
Having constructed and analysed the SNP interaction network previously, this network can now be
refined by mapping SNPs to genes, and only retaining interactions between those SNPs that map to
genes. A number of approaches for mapping SNPs to genes using different flanking distances have
been proposed; here we follow the approach used by Wang et al [31], and map SNPs to protein coding
genes that are within a flanking distance of 500kb.
In order to carry out this annotation of SNPs to genes, the software library Postgwas [32] is used.
The closest protein coding gene that maps to each SNP is then retained. After removal of duplicate
interactions due to a number of SNPs mapping to the same gene and also SNPs not being within 500kb
of a protein coding gene, this leaves 421 genes and 254 interactions of interest. As before, due to the
number of disconnected networks, the degree centrality is used to identify genes of interest. The top 20
ranking genes are shown in Table 2.

3 SNP Interaction Results
695 SNP epistatic interactions between 828 unique SNPs with a significant p-value were uncovered
using the FaST-LMM epistatic analysis method, and then subsequently these interactions were
modelled as various, disconnected networks. Table 1 shows the top 20 ranking SNPs for degree
centrality based on the SNP interaction network built from the significant SNP-SNP interactions.
These 20 SNPs alone are involved in 172 interactions out of the total 695 interactions found, despite
accounting for only 2% of the total number of interacting SNPs.

Table 1 Top 20 Ranked SNPs for Degree Centrality in SNP Interaction Networks
*Chromosome where SNP is located
**Closest protein coding gene to the SNP
Note that all the SNPs shown in the table have a Bonferroni adjusted p-value of 1
for chi-squared case/control association test
In Table 1 above, none of the SNPs have a significant adjusted single marker association p-value.
As such, these SNPs would not have been identified employing this approach, meaning that epistatic
analysis identifies SNPs that on their own are not associated with disease. Additionally, none of the
above SNPs have been identified as being associated with other diseases in previous single SNP
association GWAS in the NHGRI Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies [33].
The SNP rs9382212 is of interest, as it is close to a potential estrogen response element [34].
Estrogen receptor signalling has been shown to have a role in the resolution of hemmoragic shock and
membrane hyperpermeability [35], therefore variants in this region could lead to the incorrect
resolution of this process via dysregulation of estrogen receptor expression. Additionally, mutations in
GCLC, the closest protein coding gene to this SNP, have been associated with anaemia due to
problems in red blood cell formation [36], the gene is also implicated in myocardial infarction and
coronary endothelial vasomotor dysfunction [37].
A number of the SNPs in Table 1 are in linkage disequilibrium with each other, as seen by
mapping to the same gene, and having the same single disease association adjusted p-value. However,
they are not involved in epistatic interactions with each other, but with other SNPs located more than
1Mb away. The chromosomal location of the SNPs is of interest. 10 of the top 20 ranked SNPs are
located on chromosome 5, and more specifically, on chromosome 5q. In a previous study by Breugem
et al investigating capillary malformations [38], a locus for hereditary capillary malformations was
mapped to a region of chromosome 5q. Therefore, it is potentially biologically significant that a high
proportion of the top ranking SNPs in the list above for Clarkson disease are located in the same

729

region, considering the role of the capillary development in this disease. SNPs located at chromosome
5q in Table 1 are involved in 72 interactions, more than 10% of total interactions.

4 Gene Interaction Results
Having analysed the SNP interaction network, we repeated the process with the network of protein
coding genes that could be mapped to the SNPs. As detailed earlier, this process of mapping SNPs to
protein coding genes is carried out using the R package Postgwas. After removal of SNPs that did not
map to a protein coding within a flanking distance of 500Kb either up- or downstream, 421 genes and
254 interactions between genes remained. A number of duplicate gene interactions resulted due to
more than one SNP mapping to the same protein coding gene. This can be seen in table 1; six SNPs
map to the gene MAP1B, and four SNPs map to the gene RIOK2. These duplicate interactions were
removed when the network was simplified.
As before, there are a number of disconnected networks rather than a single network. Seven of
these networks contained five or more genes. As such, degree centrality is again used to identify genes
of interest in the networks, as other metrics such as betweenness and closeness centrality are not
appropriate due to infinite distance between nodes in disconnected networks. Table 2 shows the top 20
ranking genes for degree centrality.

Table 2 Top 20 Ranked Genes for Degree Centrality in Gene Interaction Networks

A number of these genes may have a role in the pathoetiology of Clarkson syndrome. The most
highly connected gene, PCDH8, is a protocadherin involved in cell adhesion during development.
Though generally found in the central nervous system, recent work has uncovered the expression of a
splice variant of the gene in non-neuronal tissues [39]. PSD3 represents an interesting potential target,
due to its localisation at the cell junction according to Gene Ontology (GO) [40], as well as its role in
cell signalling [41]. CHRD (chordin) is annotated in GO as heparin binding, essential in coagulation.
It is also located next to the thrombopoetin gene THPO, also important in clotting and the production
of platelets. The gene EMP1 may be of interest as it is involved in cell signalling [42]. GALR1, the
galanin receptor, is involved in a range of biological functions according to GO, and its stimulation
can lead to various downstream effects via secondary messenger pathways. In general there are a
number of signalling molecules and membrane bound receptors in Table 2, as might be expected,
since epistatic analysis methods are used to look for combinations of genetic variants.
Looking at the list of genes above, PCDH8 is again the highest ranked. In general, however, the
results of Table 1 differ from those of Table 2. This is explained by the duplicate interactions resulting
from a number of SNPs in Table 1 being in close proximity to each other, and mapping to the same
protein coding gene. As a result, the gene has fewer links due to the removal of duplicate interactions.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
Clarkson’s disease represents a complex pathology and its etiology is unknown [43]. Previous studies
have shown that sera taken from patients at the acute stage of an SCLS episode can cause a
breakdown of the interendothelial junction, related to the internalisation of VE-cadherin, an important
surface protein involved in cell-adhesion, but does not invoke cell death [47]. However, patient sera
taken outside of acute episodes did not lead to these effects, moreover the acute phase sera showed an
increased level of VEGF and Ang2, two endothelial permeability mediators. It is crucial to (i) identify
additional factors leading to the elevated levels of these molecules, and (ii) investigate whether there
is any difference in the response to these factors in SCLS susceptible individuals, as previously
suggested [17]. In this study, we sought to improve understanding of these underlying processes by
applying an epistatic interaction analysis to a published GWAS dataset comparing genetic variation
between Clarkson disease sufferers and control subjects [17]. The original analysis of this data set
looked at individual variants on a SNP-by-SNP basis, and found a number of variants that could be
mapped to genes involved in cell adhesion, an impaired response to VEGF, and G-protein activation.
In our analysis we have used an epistatic approach that seeks to find SNP pairs that differ in
frequency between Clarkson disease and control patients, suggesting that this combination of SNPs is
associated with the disease. By combining these SNP pairs we have been able to construct networks,
which can then be analysed to find highly connected SNPs, which are associated with the disease
when combined with a number of other SNPs. Importantly, these SNPs were not found to be
significantly associated when performing single SNP analysis, suggesting that they are on their own
not necessarily predictive of the disease, but rather they are required in combination with other SNPs,
highlighting the need to perform epistatic methods alongside single SNP analysis in order to uncover
such complex relationships within the dataset. Notably, we found the SNP rs9382212 to be close to a
putative estrogen response element [31]. Given the role of estrogen in the regulation of vascular
hyperpermeability [32], a potential mechanism of the disease could be a disruption of estrogen
signalling, potentially in combination with another SNP that disrupts another process. Further
investigation including stratification by sex would be interesting to see if these results are stronger in
patients of either gender, although such an analysis would not be straightforward given the rarity of
the disease and that only 4 of the disease patients in the original experiment were females.
By mapping the SNPs to their nearest protein-coding genes we were able to build networks of
gene-interactions and identify genes with high network connectivity, including integral membrane
proteins, cell-cell adhesion, secondary messenger signalling and regulation of cell junctions. It should
be noted that the workflow used in this study, shown in Figure 1, is easily transferable to other
datasets. As such, it can be easily applied to both existing data previously analysed using a single SNP
association approach, and also new data, thereby having the potential to uncover further biological
information. Additionally, the workflow can easily be modified to include other epistatic analysis
methods, and extra quality control steps that would reduce the number of SNPs and reduce the
number of pairs that have to be calculated. The process of mapping the SNPs to the gene leads to the
different results seen in tables 1 and 2, which arises due to two reasons. Firstly, a number of genes in
table 1 are not present in the gene interaction network, due to not being within 500kb of the SNP.
Secondly, as several SNPs map to the same gene, the removal of the resulting duplicate interactions
results in these genes not appearing in table 2, due to the subsequent lower degree centrality.
From a computational viewpoint, the use of HPC resources in this study has extended the scope of
the analysis, by allowing implementation of an epistatic algorithm that is not possible using standard
computing facilities. This is a clear example of the value that HPC can add to biology, and how it can
aid in providing further understanding about the complex underlying processes of disease. In
particular, for the Clarkson dataset used in this study, it has allowed the first application of an epistatic
analysis that we are aware of for this disease. In addition, results that are statistically significant and
biologically relevant have been discovered, despite the low number of samples due to the rarity of the

731

disease. This is a major constraint of the original single association study, and is responsible for a pvalue being used that is not as stringent as the typical Bonferroni corrected value that would generally
be used. In this study, the application of an epistatic analysis approach made it possible to obtain
results that were significant after Bonferroni correction, despite the low number of samples.
To conclude, in this work we have demonstrated the advantages of applying an epistatic network
approach using HPC facilities to analyse a GWAS dataset. We have identified a number of SNPs and
genes which were undetected in a single SNP approach, and which may provide new clues to
understand the pathoetiology of Clarkson’s disease. Many of the results fit in with previous
knowledge of the disease, however it is important that these results should be verified in a larger
series of patients, although it should be noted that this may be difficult due to the rarity of the disease.
In future, it is hoped that this method could be applied to other diseases, for both new and existing
GWAS data, and could be refined with the implementation of additional epistatic methods using
distinct but complementary underlying algorithms to calculate epistasis and aid in the discovery of
potential candidate genes of interest related to the underlying causes, progression, and prognosis of
disease.
