Abstract. The principal aim of this work is the presentation of a
symbolic calculation computer analysis for exploring electromagnetic
ﬁelds for not inertial observer. Based on Fr¨
olicher-Nijenhuis super-Lie
R-algebra, we developed a learning environment for axiomatic classical
electromagnetics and electrodynamics. A collection of programs developed on Mathematical programming environment has been builded for
the N-graded Graßmann Algebra, Z-graded endomorphisms and graded
commutators.

Introduction

In axiomatic classical electromagnetic is postulated that the density pseudo differential form J, grade J = d − 1 ∈ N and the strength or ‘magnetic ﬂux’ F,
grade F = 2 are absolute, are observer-free.

The ﬁrst axioms is the conservation of the density pseudo-form of the ChargeCurrent. The second axiom is interpretd as the conservation of the work (on
small test charge-current) in the space-time. See for complementary references
and formal approach Cruz & Oziewicz [1, 2003].
Starting with such axiomatic approach we use the Fr¨
olicher and Nijenhuis[2,
3] Lie R-operation to derive observer-dependent form of the four Maxwell equations.
In Section 2 we present some necessary deﬁnitions. Section 3 is devoted to
present the principal lines of the algorithm. Finally in Section 4 we present
conclusions and objectives for future work.

Basic Deﬁnitions

Let F be an R-algebra of scalar ﬁelds on Space-Time. The F-modul of the
diﬀerential 1-forms is denoted by M .
Deﬁnition 1 (Graßmann algebra of diﬀerential forms). The N-graded
Graßmann F-algebra of diﬀerential forms is denoted by:
M ∧ ≡ ⊕M ∧i = M ∧0 ⊕ M ∧1 ⊕ M ∧2 + · · · ,

M ∧0 ≡ F,

M ∧1 ≡ M.

(3)

Deﬁnition 2 (Observer ﬁeld). Is a not necessarily integrable product structure that splits F-modules of the diﬀerential one-forms M and one-vector ﬁelds,
M ∗ , into ‘time-’ and ‘space-’ F-submodules. An idempotent a2 = a ∈ der(M ∧ )
is said to be observer if tr a = 1,and dim im a = dim of time = 1.
In the present paper we represent an observer by κ. A 1-dimensional F-modul
imκ, is an ideal in the Graßmann F-algebra, and the projector (id − κ), is an
F-algebra map
(id − κ) ∈ algF (M ∧ , M ∧ /imκ) .

(4)

Deﬁnition 3 (Derivations of Graßmann algebra). Let |A| ≡ grade A ∈ Z.
A map A : M ∧ → M ∧ is said to be a graded F-derivation, A ∈ der(M ∧ ), if
Leibniz axiom holds:
A(α ∧ β) = (Aα) ∧ β + (−)|A||α| α ∧ Aβ.

∀ α, β ∈ M ∧

(5)

Example: every observer is F-derivation, a ∈ derF (M ∧ ), grade a = 0 ∈ N.
Deﬁnition 4 (Lie Super (≡ Z2 -graded) F-algebra of derivations). The
graded commutator (bracket) is:
{ , }

(End M ∧ ) ⊗ (End M ∧ ) −−−−−−−−→ (End M ∧ ),
super-bracket

{A, B} ≡ A ◦ B − (−)|A||B| B ◦ A ∈ der(M ∧ ),
grade{A, B} = grade A + grade B.

For the graded commutator the graded version of the Jacobi identity holds,
{A, {B, C}} = {{A, B}, C} + (−)AB {B, {A, C}}.

(6)

if A and B be graded derivations; A, B ∈ der(M ∧ ). Then {A, B} ∈ der(M ∧ ).
´
Deﬁnition 5 (Slebodzi´
nski Lie derivation). Let A ∈ der(M ∧ ) be any
derivation. The R-derivation introduced in 1931 [4] is:
LA ≡ {A, d} ∈ derR (M ∧ ).

(7)

Deﬁnition 6 (Fr¨
olicher and Nijenhuis R-algebra). A derivation [κ, ρ]F N ∈
derF (M ∧ ) exit, such that
L[κ,ρ]F N ≡ {Lκ , Lρ } ∈ derR (M ∧ ),
κ+ρ+κρ

[κ, ρ]F N = (−1)

(8)

· [ρ, κ]F N .

The Fr¨
olicher-Nijenhuis [1956] binary operation on the Lie M ∧ -module
derF (M ∧ ), denoted by [·, ·]F N ∈ derF (M ∧ ), with grade[·, ·] = +1, is an example
of the Gerstenhaber R-algebra.
An arbitrary derivation D ∈ derR (M ∧ ) possess the following unique decomposition
D = (L ◦ i + i ◦ L)D = {iD , d} + i{D,d} .

The generalization of the Fr¨
olicher and Nijenhuis decomposition for an extension
of DGA, was given in [Oziewicz 1991].

Outline of Algorithm

The builded functions contains:
– Appropriate data types designed for: N-graded F-algebra of the diﬀerential
forms M ∧ . Z-homogeneous graded endomorphism End (M ∧ ), Poisson graded
commutator (bracket) [ , ]F N , etc.
– Constructors for graded F- and R-derivations, Lie F- and R-derivation, observers ∈ der, and creations and annihilation operators ∈ End . Every annihilation opertator is a F-derivation.
– Procedures for Graßmann multiplication ∧, composition ◦ of graded endomorphisms and Jacobi identity for Lie and Poisson R-brackets.
A grammar deﬁnition is necessary in the way that the abstract representation
be in accordance with mathematical formal deﬁnition of objets. By example: for
the N-graded Graßmann F-algebra of diﬀerential forms M ∧ we have:
– M ∧ is generated by F and M ie M ∧ = gen{F, M }.
– If α, β ∈ M ∧ then α + β ∈ M ∧ and α ∧ β ∈ M ∧ .

grade(α ∧ β) = grade α + grade β + grade ∧, grade ∧ = 0 ∈ N.
∀α ∈ M ⇒ grade α = 1 and α ∧ α = 0.
The creation Graßmann operators is deﬁned by: eα β ≡ α∧β, eα ∈ End (M ∧ ).
The ‘inner’ or ‘interior’ action ‘i’ of M ∧ on M ∗∧ is said to be the annihilation
operator iM ∈ derF (M ∧ ).

In practical computation operators e and i play an important role, e is a data
type constructor and i is a data type selector:
e

M ∧ ⊗ M ∧ −−−−→ M ∧
i

M ∗ ⊗ M ∧ −−−−→ M ∧ .
For derivations operator we need the set of symbols: {name, grade, +}. With
those and the Leibniz axiom we build the necessary expressions for the derivation
operation, and for graded commutator we need {name, grade, +, ◦}.
For Fr¨
olicher-Nijenhuis binary operation we use the explicit form of the
bracket: Let ρ, κ ∈ der and δκ◦ρ ∈ der
[ρ, κ]F N ≡ −{κ, Lρ } − {δκ◦ρ , d}

∈ derR

(10)

Here we use a F-modul map p ∈ homF (M, M ∧ ) lifted to the unique (Z2 -graded)
F-derivation
homF (M, M ∧ )

M ∧ ⊗F M ∗

p → δp ∈ derF (M ∧ ),

with grade(δ) = 0, such that δp |F = 0 and δp |M = p.

Conclusions and Future Work

The axiomatic approach could possess pedagogical advantage in teaching the
fundamentals of electromagnetic laws as explicitly observer-dependent and gives
a power tool in the exploration of physical laws. Symbolic calculus oﬀer an appropriate tool in the exploration of abstract algebra and its applications. Future
work will be devoted to
– Get procedures for splitting diﬀerential forms and diﬀerential equation in
Space Time,
– automatize algorithmically all expressions of four Maxwell equations for non
inertial observers
– build higher order words of Lie Poisson brackets for Lie derivation of observer
operators {k, d} and ﬁnd all identities inside the Lie algebra gen{d, k1 , k2 }.
