Abstract. In this paper, we provide a parameterization of multinomial lattice random
walks which take cumulants into account. In the binomial and trinomial lattice cases, it
reduces to standard results. Additionally, we show that higher order cumulants may be
taken into account by using multinomial lattices with four or more branches. Finally,
we outline two synthesis methods which take advantage of the multinomial lattice
formulation. One is mean square optimal hedging in an incomplete market and the
other involves pricing under “implied volatility” and “implied kurtosis”.

Introduction

An important issue in pricing and hedging derivatives is the generality of the
model for the underlying asset (see e.g., [4,9,10,13]) and its computational
tractability. From this standpoint, modeling underlying asset dynamics on a
multinomial lattice is useful (see e.g., [5,6,12,14,16,17] and the books of [8,11])
due to the existence of eﬃcient methodologies for solving hedging and pricing
problems. Moreover, multinomial lattice techniques allow one to price various
types of derivative when no analytical formula is available. This paper seeks to
provide a single parameterization for multinomial lattice random walks which
can take higher order cumulants into account, instead of only the mean and variance. Before proceeding, we mention that there is an extensive body of literature
on the subject of lattice techniques in derivative pricing and hedging, and we
hope that readers will excuse our blatant omission of much of that work.

Construction of Multinomial Lattices

We will present a general description of a random walk on a multinomial lattice.
Consider a stock market in the time interval t ∈ [0, T ], where traders are allowed
to purchase and sell at discrete times tn = nτ, n = 0, 1, . . . , N , where τ := T /N .
Let Sn denote the price of the stock at t = tn , and suppose that un and dn satisfy
un > dn > 0, then a multinomial tree with L branches at each node is given by
l−1
Sn+1 = uL−l
n dn Sn , l = 1, . . . L

where pl , l = 1, . . . L are the corresponding probabilities which satisfy p 1 +
· · · + pL = 1. To make the multinomial tree recombine, we further assume that
un /dn = c for all n = 0, . . . , N −1 for some constant c (> 1). One can verify that
the process in (1) consists of a lattice (or a recombining multinomial tree), where
the stock may achieve n(L − 1) + 1 possible prices at time t = tn , n = 0, . . . , N .
For example, in the case of un = u and dn = d for all n = 1, . . . , N − 1, the price
of the stock at the k-th node from the top of the lattice is given by
Sn(k) = un(L−1)+1−k dk−1 S0 , k = 1, 2, . . . , n(L − 1) + 1.

Parameterization for Multinomial Lattices with Cumulants

Let Xn be the log stock return between tn and tn+1 deﬁned as
Xn := ln Sn+1 − ln Sn ,
and assume that each Xn is independent. Notice that
ln SN = ln S0 +

Xn .

n=0

We will construct multinomial lattice random walks to model stock price dynamics in terms of (local) cumulants of Xn through suitable choices of the parameters, L, N , u, d and p1 , . . . , pL . The m-th cumulant of Xn will be denoted
by
C (Xnm ) .
Note that the cumulant C (Xnm ) is a polynomial in the moments E (Xnv ) with
v ≤ m, where the ﬁrst and second cumulants are the mean and variance of
Xn , respectively. The third and fourth cumulants are related to skewness and
(Fisher) kurtosis, and are given by

(3)
C Xn3 = Mn(3) , C Xn4 = Mn(4) − 3Mn(2) ,
(m)

where Mn

is the m-th central moment given as
Mn(m) = E [(Xn − E (Xn )) ] .
m

The cumulants have an additive property when independent
random variables
�N −1
are summed. For example, the m-th cumulant of n=0 Xn is just the sum of
the m-th cumulants of Xn for n = 0, . . . , N − 1.
We will provide a parameterization of multinomial lattice random walks
which take cumulants into account. Let

where α > 0 is some constant. One can readily see that un /dn is constant for
all n = 0, . . . , N − 1 if α is ﬁxed. With these choices for un and dn , Xn may be
computed as

Since we have not speciﬁed any variables in (4) yet (except τ (= T /N )), we have
L − 1 plus 2 unknown parameters, p1 , . . . , pL−1 (where pL may be calculated
as pL = 1 − (p1 + · · · + pL−1 ), νn and α. We will use these parameters to take
advantage of additional information (i.e., cumulants).
Suppose that νn τ is the mean of Xn , i.e., the ﬁrst cumulant (mean) of Xn is
C(Xn ) = E (Xn ) = νn τ.

Binomial Lattice Case: To illustrate the parameterization described above,
we ﬁrst consider the case of L = 2, i.e., the binomial lattice case. Since there are
already two constraints for the probabilities p1 and p2 , i.e.,
p1 + p2 = 1,

2
�
l=1

pl (L − 2l + 1) = p1 − p2 = 0,

we obtain p1 = p2 = 1/2. Suppose that the variance of Xn is given by σn2 τ . This
condition restricts α = 1 and σn to be constant, i.e., σn = σ (n = 0, . . . , N − 1),
and we have the binomial lattice formula provided in [11] (see also the original
work of [5])

un = exp νn τ + σ τ , dn = exp νn τ − σ τ , p1 = p2 = 1/2.

Trinomial Lattice Case: In the case of a trinomial lattice, i.e., L = 3, we have
one more parameter p3 , and this allows us to take local volatility information
into account, i.e., the second cumulant. Suppose that the second cumulant (i.e.,
variance) of Xn is given by σn2 τ . In this case, we have
p1 + p2 + p3 = 1, 2p1 − 2p2 = 0, 4p1 + 4p2 = ασn2 .

(9)

where the second and third equations are obtained from (6) and (7), respectively.
By solving (9) with respect to p1 , p2 and p3 , we ﬁnd

To guarantee that these probabilities are positive, α must satisfy 0 < α < 4/σ n2 .
If σn is constant, i.e., σn = σ (n = 0, . . . , N − 1), one may use α = 4/(3σ 2 ),
which provides a trinomial lattice formula whose up, middle, and down rates
and corresponding probabilities are given by

√ �
�
�
u2n = exp νn τ + σ 3τ , un dn = exp (νn τ ) , d2n = exp νn τ − σ 3τ ,
[p1 , p2 , p3 ] = [1/6, 2/3, 1/6].
This also corresponds to a well known ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme.
If σn is a function of (Sn , n), i.e., σn = σ(Sn , n), the above formula can be
modiﬁed by writing σn in terms of a nominal value σ̂ as
σn = (1 + δn )σ̂.
Let α be chosen as α = 4/(3σ̂ 2 ). Then the up, middle, and down probabilities
are given as

Note that the probabilities are positive as long as − 3 − 1 < δn < 3 − 1.
Multinomial Lattice Case: Similarly, one can pose additional conditions
given by higher order cumulants by using four or more branches in a multinomial lattice. For example, if we have third cumulant information corresponding
to skewness, this imposes an additional constraint,

four branches are used in the multinomial lattice, i.e., L = 4. If we solve four
linear equations for the probabilities p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , we obtain

We ﬁrst notice that the probabilities are symmetric, i.e., p 1 = p5 and p2 = p4 .
In this formulation, p1 , p3 and p5 increase with larger kurtosis. On the other
hand, p2 and p4 decrease if kurtosis increases. Therefore, this conﬁrms that the
probability distribution of Xn becomes heavy tailed under positive kurtosis.
If skewness is not zero, the formulation in (10) becomes
[p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p5 ] =

with the choice of α = 4/σ 2 . In this case, we readily see that the probabilities
are not symmetric if sn � = 0. Moreover, positive (negative) skewness causesp1
and p4 to increase (decrease), and the corresponding probabilities p5 and p2 to
decrease (increase) by an equal amount.
2.2

Parameterization with Time-Dependent Distributions

In this section, we deal directly with the stock price distribution, rather than
characterizing it through cumulants. We will consider the case where the stock
price distribution is available at every time tn . Under this assumption, we show
that a multinomial lattice can be constructed as follows:
1. Generate a binomial lattice to match the distribution of the stock at every
time step.
2. Create a multinomial lattice based on the binomial lattice.
Let Pn (Sn ) be the probability distribution of the stock at t = tn . Pn (Sn ) may
be obtained from historical data.
We begin by using a binomial lattice to describe the stock dynamics. Consider
the stock prices arranged on a binomial lattice as shown in the left side of Table
1, where the price of the stock on the k-th node from the top of the lattice is
(k)
denoted by Sn . Furthermore, the probability of obtaining the price Snk at time
(k)
n is given by Pn = Pn (Snk ) as shown in Table 1.
(k)
(k)
(k)
Let pn denote the probability of moving from Sn to Sn+1 (this corresponds
(k)
to an “up” move). The probability for a corresponding “down” move from Sn
(k+1)
(k)
(k)
to Sn+1 is given by pn,d = 1 − pn . These probabilities are computed based
(k)

on the node probabilities Pn (k = 1, . . . , N, k = 1, . . . , n + 1) as follows:
(k)
Consider the node probabilities at the n-th period, Pn (k = 1, . . . , n + 1), and
(k)
the node probabilities at the (n + 1)-th period, Pn+1 (k = 1, . . . , n + 2), where

Using (11) and (12), pn may be computed for all n = 0, . . . , N − 1 and
k = 1, . . . , n + 1. This constructs a binomial lattice matching the stock price
distribution.
We may now construct a multinomial lattice based on the binomial lattice as
follows: Consider a two step binomial lattice, where we suppose that the up and
(1)
(2)
down rates, u and d, and probabilities p, p1 , and p1 are speciﬁed as shown in
the left side of Fig. 1. The right side of Fig. 1 is a trinomial tree, where the up,
middle, and down states are given by Su2 , Sud and Sd2 . If the up, middle, and
down probabilities of the tree are given by
(1)

(1)

(1)

(1)

pu = p · p1 , pm = p · (1 − p1 ) + (1 − p) · p1 , pd = (1 − p) · (1 − p1 )

then the binomial lattice and the trinomial tree will deﬁne the same random
walk as far as the initial state and ﬁnal distributions are concerned, i.e., both
random walks have ﬁnal distributions with identical statistical properties. More
generally, in a similar manner one may construct a multinomial lattice with L
branches at each node based on a multi-step binomial lattice.

Synthesis Methods

Once we have constructed a multinomial lattice, we may apply several techniques
for pricing and hedging derivatives. In this section, we demonstrate some of these

techniques which are used with multinomial lattices. Since most of the following
ideas have been considered extensively in the literature, we merely provide a
brief outline of them in this paper.
3.1

Mean Square Optimal Hedges

Mean square optimal hedging is a trading strategy which constructs a portfolio
whose payoﬀ approximates that of a derivative security as closely as possible in
the mean square error sense. Although we only deal with the case of a European
call option in this subsection, the same approach can be extended to other types
of options, including many exotics (such as barriers, compounds, and others)
and options with time optionality (such as Americans and Bermudans).
Let Bn denote the price of a (risk free) bond under the time dependent
interest rate rn where Bn satisﬁes
Bn = (1 + rn )Bn−1 , n = 1, . . . , N.

(13)

at discrete times tn = nτ, n = 0, 1, . . . , N . Also, let Cn , n = 0, 1, . . . , N denote
the value of a call option with strike price K, which pays
CN = (SN − K)

+

at maturity t = T . Finally, we deﬁne a portfolio (δn , θn ) ∈ �2 indexed by time
n = 0 . . . N , and let
Ωn := δn Sn + θn Bn , n = 0 . . . N

(14)

be the value of the portfolio, where δn represents the number of shares of stock
and θn the number of bonds held by the trader during the time interval t ∈
[tn , tn+1 ). Finally, we assume that the portfolio is self-ﬁnancing;
δn−1 Sn + θn−1 Bn = δn Sn + θn Bn ,

∀

n = 1 . . . N.

(15)

We now introduce an optimal hedging strategy to minimize the mean square
of the diﬀerence between the ﬁnal payoﬀ of the call option and the value of the

portfolio (i.e. CN − ΩN ), namely mean square optimal hedging (MSOH):

� Subject to : δn ∈ �, n = 0, . . . , N − 1, Ω0 ∈ �

To obtain the optimal hedging strategy δk ∈ �, k = 0, . . . , N − 1 and initial
portfolio wealth Ω0 , dynamic programming (see e.g., [1]) may be applied once
probabilities for possible outcomes for the stock have been assigned. Note that
the MSOH problem can be solved very eﬃciently by dynamic programming if
the stock process is modeled on a lattice [7].
3.2

Volatility Smile and Implied Kurtosis

We next discuss pricing models which take the “volatility smile” into account.
There is a large body of literature which provides option pricing formulas for
smiley options by using binomial lattices, trinomial lattices, or ﬁnite diﬀerence
methods (see e.g., [6,8,14,16,17] and references therein). A common approach is
to use market option data to determine a corresponding local volatility function
or risk neutral probability distribution to match the volatility smile.
Another approach to modeling the local volatility function for smiley options
is to take advantage of the so-called implied kurtosis [3,15]. This approach simply
requires an estimate of implied kurtosis which can be extracted from the market
price of options. The relation between implied kurtosis and the volatility smile
is given by the following equation [3,15]:
�
�
��
κτ (K − Sn )2
−1
(17)
σ(Sn , n) = σ 1 +
24
σ 2 Sn2 T
where σ can be thought as a “true volatility” corresponding to the variance of
the stock price distribution at maturity, and κ is the (annualized) kurtosis of
the stock price distribution. Therefore, this formulation provides a connection
between implied volatility and a constant volatility with kurtosis.
Given the formula in (17), one can apply local volatility based pricing methods such as trinomial lattices or corresponding ﬁnite diﬀerence methods (see e.g.,
[8] and references therein). However it might be more suitable to use a multinomial lattice to take kurtosis (or the fourth cumulant) into account. In this
case, one can directly construct a multinomial lattice with ﬁve branches as in
Subsection 2.1, with constant σ and κ, instead of using a trinomial lattice with
a local volatility function. A more sophisticated model can be developed by taking into consideration the time dependence of kurtosis, i.e., k n , which provides
a volatility surface curve. One can then apply standard risk neutral valuation
techniques for derivatives pricing.

Conclusion

In this paper, we provided a parameterization of multinomial lattice random
walks which take cumulants into account. In the binomial and trinomial lattice cases, this parameterization reduced to standard formulas. We showed that

588

higher order cumulants may be taken into account by using multinomial lattices with four or more branches. Finally, we demonstrated two types of synthesis methods which take advantage of multinomial lattices: mean square optimal hedging in incomplete markets and valuation techniques which use implied
volatility or kurtosis.
