Abstract. Most of the biological studies have embraced statistical approaches to
make inferences. It is common to have several independent experiments to test
the same null hypothesis. The goal of research on pooling evidence is to combine
the results of these tests to ask if there is evidence from the collection of studies
to reject the null hypothesis. In this study, we evaluated four different pooling
techniques (Fisher, Logit, Stouffer and Liptak) to combine the evidence from independent microarray experiments in order to identify cell cycle-regulated genes.
We were able to identify a better set of cell cycle-regulated genes using the pooling techniques based on our benchmark study on budding yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae). Our gene ontology study on time series data of both the budding
yeast and the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) showed that the GO
terms that are related to cell cycle are significantly enriched in the cell cycleregulated genes identified using pooling techniques.

1 Introduction
In bioinformatics analyses, the process of making inferences and extracting knowledge from data is complicated by the fact that the data may arrive from diverse
sources. These varied sources of data may be heterogeneous or homogeneous. For
example, in order to predict potential transcription factor binding sites, one may use
heterogeneous sources of data such as gene expression data (to infer co-expressed
genes), ChIP-chip data (to obtain information on binding sites for known transcription
factors), upstream promoter sequence data (to infer shared and over-expressed sequence motifs), text literature (to use information from reported biological experiments on known transcription factors and their binding sites), sequence data on other
related organisms (to infer conserved regions in the genome sequence and to get supporting evidence for the predictions), gene ontology information (to identify functionally-related genes), and much more. Even for a focused study (with homogeneous
sources of data) that attempts to identify which set of genes show significant change
in expression in a tissue sample from a lung cancer patient relative to that from a
normal patient, it is possible that the data may be collected from a wide variety of
individuals and the experiments may be performed by different research groups
under varying conditions. While a host of bioinformatics methods exist for making

inferences from a single data set (along with providing statistical significance for
these inferences), a significant challenge is posed when inferences have to be made
based on multiple sources of data. It is non-trivial to integrate different sources of data
(with different levels of variability and reliability) to arrive at one coherent set of
conclusions.
Several procedures for pooling of such evidence in meaningful ways exist in the
statistical literature [1-4]. The earliest work on implementing pooling strategies in
bioinformatics is to be found in the work of Bailey and Gribskov, where they developed an algorithm called QFAST for the sequence homology search problem [5].
Their algorithm used a variant of Fisher’s inverse Chi-square method without reference to the Chi-square distribution for computational efficiency [5]. In this study we
investigate and evaluate a variety of statistical techniques to combine or pool together
evidence from many homogeneous sources to arrive at meaningful conclusions. To
evaluate these techniques, we revisit the familiar problem of using gene expression
data to identify cell cycle-regulated genes in two related organisms: budding yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We consider existing tools to identify cell cycle-regulated genes and investigate the change in
their performance after they are applied to three different yeast data sets generated by
Spellman et al. and the evidence is pooled.
The cell-division cycle is fundamental to the proliferation of all organisms, and
knowledge of its regulation helps in understanding various diseases [6]. Periodic gene
expression seems to be a universal feature of cell cycle regulation. In 1998, the first
genome-wide DNA microarray studies were conducted in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, to reveal a large number of cell cycle-regulated genes that peaked only once
per cell cycle [7, 8]. More recently, microarray experiments have been conducted to
study the cell cycle regulation in the fission yeast S. pombe, which is a distant relative
of budding yeast [6, 9]. Both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are useful organisms for the
study of the cell division cycle because they have many well-characterized cell division cycle mutants [10]. In particular, the budding yeast data sets have driven the
development of various computational methods for identifying periodically expressed
genes [11-15]. Some of these methods even provided statistical significance (in terms
of P-values) for their predictions [14, 15].
In order to demonstrate the efficacy of pooling, we considered two existing tools
for identifying cell cycle-regulated genes [14, 15]. Although several other tools exist
for this task, they were not appropriate for our study since they did not return Pvalues for their predictions for the individual experiments.

2 Methods
2.1 Identifying Cell Cycle-Regulated Genes
We adopted Fisher’s g-test to test the periodicity of a gene [14]. A P-value was
obtained for each time course data [14]. The lower the P-value, the more periodic
is the gene. We also tested the periodicity of a gene using a permutation-based
method [15].

2.2 Combining Evidence Using P-Values
Given several independent sets of samples along with the corresponding P-values for
a certain property, the idea of combining the P-values to obtain a unified measure of
significance has a long history. The existing methods are Fisher’s inverse Chi-square
method [1], George and Mudholkar’s logit method [2], Stouffer’s overall z method
[4], and the Liptak-Stouffer [3] method.
In bioinformatics, combining inferences has been applied to sequence homology
search, protein classification and scoring motifs [5, 16]. Their method is a variant of
the Fisher’s inverse Chi-square method. A more recent application can be found in the
work of Oliva et al. on the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where they
used Stouffer’s method to obtain a single P-value for each gene from the three
P-values inferred from the two elutriation experiments and the cdc25 block-release
experiment in order to identify oscillating transcripts [9].
With the goal of evaluating the various P-value pooling techniques, we picked
the problem of identifying cell cycle-regulated genes in budding yeast and fission
yeast. The null hypothesis was that there is no periodic component in the time
course data for the gene in question. The first advantage of choosing this problem
was the ready availability of several independent cell cycle microarray experiments
(alpha, cdc15 and cdc28) to test whether they collectively reject the null hypothesis.
The second and more important reason for using the budding yeast data set is that
de Lichtenberg et al. had also designed benchmark data to evaluate the results of the
predictions [15]. The techniques we evaluate will provide us with P-values (for
each gene) supporting the claim that the gene in question is cell cycle-regulated.
The benchmark data sets allow us to measure the ability of different methods to
identify the cell cycle-regulated genes. Below we describe the pooling techniques
that were evaluated in this work. Since benchmark data is not readily available for
the fission yeast, we were unable to evaluate the data sets in the same way that the
budding yeast data set was. We identified the periodically expressed genes in the
fission yeast using the pooling methods and the results were evaluated for functional enrichment.
2.2.1 The Fisher Method
N

The Fisher procedure [1] for pooling the P-values is given by

F = ∑ − 2 ln( Pi )
i =1

where N is the number of tests to be combined. Under the null hypothesis, the Pi’s
can be assumed to have a uniform distribution in the range of [0,1]. Thus under this
condition F has a χ2-distribution with 2N degrees of freedom. The P-value associated with the F-score is given by P ( X ≥ F ), where X ~ x ( 2 N ) . Although
Fisher’s method is the most commonly used method for combining information
across multiple test of the same null hypothesis, one significant drawback of
Fisher’s method is that it is asymmetrically sensitive to small P-values compared to
large P-values.

2.2.2 The Logit Method
N

A logit procedure is given by L

= −∑ (Pi (1 − Pi )) [2]. Under the null hypothesis,
i =1

L has the distribution of a convolution of N logistic random variables. The distribution of L can be approximated as L

2.2.3 Stouffer’s Z-Transform Method
The Z-transform

Z i = Φ −1 ( Pi ) , converts the P-values, Pi, from each of the N

independent tests into standard norm deviates Zi. The sum of the Zi’s, divided by the
square root of the number of tests, N, has a standard normal distribution if the
N

common null hypothesis is true [4]. Thus,

Zs = ∑ Zi

N can be compared to the

i =1

standard normal distribution to provide a test of the cumulative evidence on the
common null hypothesis [4].
2.2.4 Liptak-Stouffer’s Weighted Z-Method
Liptak generalized Stouffer’s Z-transform method by giving different weights
to each study according to their power [3]. The scoring is given by
N

Z w = ∑ Wi Z i

. There are different ways to choose the weights. Usually

i =1

sample size or the inverse of the sample error variance is chosen as the weight for
each test. It is debatable whether the weighted Z-method is appropriate since the
P-values are already weighted by the sample size.
2.3 Gene Expression Data and Benchmark Data
We used three budding yeast cell cycle gene expression data. These three gene
expression data set were obtained from samples of budding yeast cultures
synchronized by three different methods: α-factor arrest, and arrest of two different
temperature-sensitive mutants (cdc15 and cdc28) [8].
Fission yeast cell cycle data were obtained from S. pombe Functional Genomics
website [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/PostGenomics/S_pombe/projects/cellcycle/]. Three
elutriation and three cdc25 block-release cell cycle data were used in this study. The
goal of using the fission yeast data was to be able to compare the results obtained
from the budding and the fission yeast. Plus, fission yeast data sets are very new and
substantial[9].

G. Zheng et al.

The performance of the P-value pooling methods were evaluated by measuring
their abilities to identify genes from two of the three benchmark sets provided by de
Lichtenberg et al. [15]. Benchmark data sets B1 and B2 were used in this comparative
study. B1 consisted of a total of 113 genes previously identified as periodically
expressed in small-scale experiments [15]. B2 consisted of genes whose promoters
were bound by at least one of the nine known cell cycle transcription factors in the
Chromatin IP studies [15]. After removing 50 genes that belonged to B1, B2 consisted
of 352 genes which were deemed to be cell cycle-regulated. Benchmark data B3 was
not used because it was deemed unreliable by the authors [15].

3 Results and Discussion
Summarizing our benchmarking experiments on S. cerevisiae, we have two methods
to identify cell cycle-regulated genes from a single data set (Fisher’s g-test and permutation method), three different gene expression data sets for S. cerevisiae (alpha,
cdc15 and cdc28), four methods to pool P-values when any given method is used to
identify the periodic genes from the three data sets, and two different benchmark sets
of known cell cycle-regulated genes (B1 and B2 for S. cerevisiae). For S. pombe, we
have six independent gene expression data sets and no readily available benchmark
sets of cell cycle-regulated genes. Finally, for each of the experiments, the lists of
significantly periodic genes obtained from the budding and the fission yeast data sets
were queried against Gene Ontology database to obtain a list of significantly enriched
GO terms.
3.1 Benchmark Results for S. cerevisiae
A set of P-values were obtained for each data set using either Fisher’s g-test or permutation method. Each gene was associated with a P-value obtained from the individual data sets. The P-values were combined using the four P-value pooling methods
mentioned above for S. cerevisiae. For each method, the genes were ranked based on
the corresponding P-values. Lower P-values were ranked higher. Figure 1 shows the
performance of Fisher’s g-test and permuation method on each of three individual
microarray expression data sets for S. cerevisiae along with that of the four P-value
pooling techniques to combine the evidence from the three experimental data sets.
3.2 Function Enrichment of Periodically Expressed Genes
To assess the ability of pooling technique to identify cell cycle-regulated genes, gene
ontology information was used to evaluate whether the identified cell cycle- regulated
genes have significant enrichment of one or more terms that are related to cell cycle.
This was done using GOMiner [17]. A Fisher’s exact test is used to test if a GO term
is enriched or depleted. For the budding yeast, three P-values were generated for
each gene based on the three experiments using Fisher’s g-test [14]. A single P-value
was obtained for each gene using the logit pooling procedure. (Only the logit method
was used in this analysis, since the four pooling methods were comparable in performance, with the logit method being marginally better). To correct the P-values for
multiple testing, the method of Benjamini and Hochberg [18] was used to control the

positives at a given rate q. A list of 1686 genes was identified as cell cycle-coupled

for the budding yeast when q is set to 0.05. In a similar fashion, a list of 1315 genes
was found to be cell cycle-regulated. These periodic genes were fed to GOMiner to
find enriched GO terms. Table 1 shows the functional enrichment results.

4 Conclusions
In general, we are able to identify a better set of cell cycle-regulated genes by pooling
the evidence from individual experiments. The performance of the four pooling methods was comparable. The performance of the Liptak-Stouffer method was slightly
inferior to the other three pooling methods, while that of logit was marginally superior. While the Fisher’s inverse Chi-square for pooling is quite popular, the other
methods appeared to be less known.
In our functional enrichment studies, we found cell cycle-related GO terms were
significantly enriched for the cell cycle-regulated genes identified using the Logit
pooling method for both organisms. More interestingly, two children terms under
cytokinesis term were more significantly enriched than the parent cytokinesis term for
both organisms. It is also interesting to note that while there is an enrichment of genes
from the G1/S transition process of the mitotic cell cycle in both organisms, genes
from the G2/M transition process were significant only in S. pombe. It is also important to note that the study of data sets from two related organisms provided an opportunity to compare differences in significant genes for the cell cycle regulation.
We compared four different P-value pooling techniques and showed that they perform better than methods that use only a single data set. There are numerous potential
applications for P-value pooling methods in the field of Bioinformatics. They are
useful in any application where one has access to different data sets and statistical
significance for the predictions.
