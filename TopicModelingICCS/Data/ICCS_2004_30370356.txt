Abstract. The vortex–in–cell method for three-dimensional, viscous
ﬂow was presented. A viscous splitting algorithm was used. Initially the
Euler inviscid equation was solved. Following that, the viscous eﬀect was
taken into account by the solution of the diﬀusion equation. The diﬀusion equation was then solved by the particle strength exchange (PSE)
method. Validation of the method was tested by simulation of the leapfrogging phenomenon for two vortex rings moving along a common axis
of symmetry and the reconnection phenomenon of two colliding vortex
rings for viscous ﬂow.

Introduction

Interest in computational vortex methods stems from the fact that vorticity
plays a fundamental role in all real ﬂuid dynamics phenomena. Vortex particles
introduced into the computation permit direct tracking of the vorticity and, additionally, allow for an analysis of the ﬂow phenomena in terms of this vorticity.
One can distinguish two diﬀerent types of vortex methods, the direct method
based on the Biot-Savart law where the velocity of each vortex particle is calculated by summing up the contribution of all particles in the domain, and the
vortex–in–cell (VIC) method where the velocity is obtained on grid nodes by
solving Poisson equations for a vector potential. After that, we diﬀerentiate it
using the ﬁnite diﬀerence method, and interpolate the value of the velocity to
the position of the vortex particles. Despite the development of fast summation
algorithms, VIC methods are still several orders faster than direct methods [1,
4]. In the literature one ﬁnds that VIC calculations relate mainly to 2D ﬂow,
whereas the extension to 3D ﬂow still requires further investigation.
In this work we validate a 3D VIC method using examples of vortex ring
dynamics: the leap-frogging of two vortex rings, and the reconnection of two colliding vortex rings. The vortex rings are the simplest 3D vortex structures that
can be utilized easily in the laboratory. They are observable in the real turbulent
ﬂow. The interaction of two vortex rings gives an interesting and good example
of non-linear interaction of the regions with concentrated vorticity and it may
serve as a clue to understanding the nature of turbulence.

Equations of Motion and Description of the
Vortex–in–Cell Method

The equations that describe the evolution of the vorticity ﬁeld in the three
dimensional, incompressible, viscous ﬂow are [2]:
∂ω
+ (u · ∇) ω = (ω · ∇) u + ν ∆ω ,
∂t

(1)

∇·u = 0

(2)

where ω = (ω1 , ω2 , ω3 ) is the vorticity vector, u = (u1 , u2 , u3 ) is the velocity
and ν – kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid. The condition of incompressibility (2)
assures the existence of vector potential A [8]:
u = ∇×A

(3)

where the components of vector potential A are obtained by the solution of the
Poisson equations (it is assumed additionally that ∇ · A = 0):
∆Ai = − ωi ,

i = 1, 2, 3 .

(4)

In the vortex–in–cell method, (actually we should speak about the vorticity–
in–cell method) the continuous ﬁeld of vorticity is replaced by a discrete distribution of Dirac delta measures [2,10]:
N

αp (xp ) δ(x − xp )

ω(x) =

(5)

p=1

where αp means vorticity particle αp = (αp1 , αp2 , αp3 ) at position xp =
(xp1 , xp2 , xp3 ). The domain of the ﬂow is covered by the numerical mesh
(Nx × Ny × Nz ) with equidistant spacing h, and the i-component of the vector
particle αp is deﬁned by the expression:
ωi (x1 , x2 , x3 ) dx ≈ h3 ωi (xp ) ,

αi =

xp ∈ V p ,

|Vp | = h3 .

(6)

Vp

In our method, the modelling of the viscous, incompressible ﬂow is based on
the viscous splitting algorithm:
• At ﬁrst the Euler equations of motion for the inviscid ﬂow are solved. From
the Helmholtz theorem we know that the vorticity is carried on by the ﬂuid:
d xp
= u(xp , t) ,
dt

(7)

d αp
= [∇ u(xp , t)] · αp .
dt

(8)

The right side of (8) may be expressed by virtue of the vector identity
as (ω · ∇)u = [∇u] · ω = [∇u]T · ω = 0.5([∇u] + [∇u]T ) · ω [2]. We use the
term ([∇u]T · ω) because it better preserves the invariants of the motion for
the inviscid ﬂow [2]. Velocity and stretching are calculated on the grid nodes
by the ﬁnite diﬀerence method and after that they are interpolated to the
position of the particles.
• Next, the strength of the vector particles αp , due to the viscosity, is updated:
d αp
= ν ∆α(xp ) .
dt

(9)

The Laplacian on the right side of (9) according to the PSE method is replaced
by the integral operator, and the equation takes the form:
N

d αp
(αq − αp ) η
= ν σ −2
dt
q=1

xq − xp
σ

.

(10)

The kernel η must satisfy the moment properties [2]:
xi xj η(x) dx = 2 δij

for i, j = 1, 2, 3 ,

xii1 xij2 η(x) dx = 0

(11)

if i1 + i2 = 1 or 3 ≤ i1 + i2 ≤ r + 1 ,

|x|r+2 |η(x)| dx < ∞ .

(12)
(13)

As a kernel η(x) we took the function [3]:



η(x) =




C
1 + |x|2
0

for |x| ≤ 2 ,
(14)
for |x| > 2

where C = 0.269 was calculated by us in order to satisfy the condition (11).
That guarantees that the PSE method is second order. In calculating we took
σ = 1.5 h. Such a choice of σ we made on the basis of a numerical study concerning the dissipation rate of kinetic energy. Equation (10) is solved using the
second order Euler scheme.
To solve (4) on the numerical mesh the strength of particles αp has to be
redistributed on the mesh nodes (l, m, n):
ωi (xl , xm , xn ) =

1
h3

αi (xp ) ϕlmn (xp ) ,
p

i = 1, 2, 3

where for ϕ we used the B-spline of the third order ϕlmn (x) = ϕl (x) ϕm (y) ϕn (z)
and the one-dimensional B-spline has the form:
 1
2

|x|3 − x2 +




3





0
for |x| > 2 .
The equations (4) are solved by the fast Poisson solver with the periodic
boundary conditions.
Summarizing, calculation at one time step tn = n ∆t goes as follows:
1) redistribution of the particle masses on the grid nodes (15),
2) solution of the Poisson equations (4) and calculations of the velocity on the
grid nodes by virtue of (3),
3) interpolation of the velocities from the grid nodes to the particle positions
by the second order Lagrange interpolation, advancing in time the positions
of particles using the fourth order Runge–Kutta method (7) and updating the
strength of the particles (8),
4) in the new positions, the strength of the particles is updated due to the
viscosity (10).
This completes the one time step.

Numerical Results

As a computational domain for our experiments we chose a cube 10 × 10 × 10
covered by a rectangular grid with equidistant spacing h = 0.1 in each direction
(Fig. 1A). The time step was ∆t = 0.02. The single vortex ring was divided
into 100 slices (Fig. 1B) and in each slice the vorticity was redistributed on
121 particles (Fig. 1C). Finally, one ring was approximated by the set of 12,100
vector vorticity particles.

At ﬁrst we tried to reproduce the leap-frogging (”vortex game”) phenomenon
[7,11,14]. When two co-axial vortex rings are made to travel in the same direction
the velocity ﬁeld induced by the second ring will cause the ﬁrst ring to contract
and accelerate. At the same time the velocity ﬁeld induced by the ﬁrst ring
causes an expansion in diameter and a slowing down of the second ring. In eﬀect
the ﬁrst ring is drawn through the center of the second ring and emerges in front
of it. When this occurs the roles of the rings are reversed and the process may
repeat itself. The numerical results of the simulation of the ”vortex game” is
presented in Fig. 2. We used two identical vortex rings with a uniform vorticity
distribution inside the cores. Their parameters were: radius of the rings R = 1.5,
radius of the cores ε = 0.15, circulation Γ = 1.0 and the positions of the ring
centers: (5.0, 3.4, 5.0), (5.0, 4.3, 5.0).

phenomenon in the inviscid ﬂow

In this case we assume that the ﬂow is inviscid. It is known that the ”vortex game” is relatively diﬃcult to repeat experimentally [7]. This is due to the
fact that it is very sensitive in regard to the initial positions of the rings and
their parameters. In Fig. 3 we presented the ”vortex game” starting from different initial parameters: radiuses of the rings R1 = 1.0, R2 = 1.5; radiuses of
the cores ε1 = 0.3, ε2 = 0.25; circulations Γ1 = 1.5, Γ2 = 1.0; the positions:
(5.0, 3.5, 5.0), (5.0, 4.0, 5.0). In eﬀect during their evolution the tail structure
emerged. It is the most typical situation observed in the experiments [14].

Next we studied the reconnection of two vortex rings in viscous ﬂow. It is
an intriguing phenomenon (also called cut-and-connect or crosslinking) involving collision of two vortex rings that leads to the changes in connectivity and
topology of the vortex rings. It has been extensively studied numerically and
experimentally [5,6,13]. We used two identical vortex rings with a uniform vorticity distribution inside the cores. Their parameters were: radius of the rings
R = 1.0, radius of the cores ε = 0.4, circulations |Γ | = 1.0 and the positions:
(5.0, 3.5, 6.0), (5.0, 6.5, 6.0). The initial inclination of the rings to the vertical axis
was 54 ◦ . Kinematic viscosity was ν = 0.001. The sequence of the time position
of the vortex particles for the reconnection phenomenon was presented at Fig.
4. In the top diagrams, two rings collided and, in the eﬀect of the ﬁrst reconnection, formed one elongated ring (t = 15.0). Further evolution of this ring led to a
second reconnection and in the end there were again two rings connected by the
thin ﬁlaments (bottom diagrams of Fig. 4). The time evolution of |ω| iso-surfaces
during the reconnection phenomenon was shown at Fig. 5. For better viewing,
the bottom diagrams show the vorticity ﬁeld from a diﬀerent point of view than
the top ones do. In the two top diagrams (t = 4.0, t = 10.0), a part of vorticity
was removed from one ring in order to better show the contact zone. The ﬁnal
diagram clearly shows two vortex rings connected by two thin vortex structures,
in literature called ”threads” [6,9]. The presented sequence of the vortex rings
reconnection process is in good qualitative agreement with the experiment [13].

Closing Remarks

The presented results indicate that the vorticity particle method is very attractive for studying vortex dynamics phenomena. Compared to the direct vortex
method, the vorticity particle method is several orders faster [1,4]. In the near
future we intend to include in the algorithm a solid boundary with a no-slip
condition, and create a general-purpose program for simulating viscous ﬂow in
3D.
