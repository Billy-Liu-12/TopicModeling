Abstract. A general method for ﬁnding theta-stable parabolic subalgebras was given in 2004 . In this paper, we develop LiE subroutines to ﬁnd
representatives of conjugacy classes of polarizable theta-stable parabolic
subalgebras. Using a theorem of Tauvel, we implement algorithms for
computing the KC -saturation of the nilradical of such parabolic subalgebras. Furthermore, we provide a tool for testing a long standing conjecture that relates the wave front set of a representation of a real or p-adic
group to special nilpotent orbits. Incidently, the conjecture is true for
classical groups.

Introduction

Let g be a real semisimple Lie algebra with adjoint group G and Cartan decomposition g = k ⊕ p relative to a Cartan involution θ. We will denote by gC the
complexiﬁcation of g. Let σ be the conjugation of gC with respect to g. Then
gC = kC ⊕ pC where kC and pC are obtained by complexifying k and p respectively. K will be a maximal compact Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra k and
KC will be the connected subgroup of the adjoint group GC of gC , with Lie algebra kC . It is well known that KC acts on pC and the number of nilpotent orbits
of KC in pC is ﬁnite. Furthermore, for a nilpotent e ∈ pC , KC .e is a connected
component of GC .e ∩ pC and dim KC .e = 1/2 dim GC .e.
Let q be a parabolic subalgebra of gC with Levi decomposition q = l ⊕ u.
Denote by Q the connected Lie subgroup of GC with Lie algebra q. Then there
is a unique nilpotent orbit OgC of GC on gC meeting u in an open dense set. The
intersection OgC ∩ u consists of a single Q-orbit under the adjoint action of Q on
u. These facts were ﬁrst proved by Richardson [9].
The Kostant-Sekiguchi correspondence is a bijection between nilpotent orbits
of G in g and nilpotent orbits of KC on pC . Thus, the correspondence allows
us to study certain questions about real nilpotent orbits by looking at nilpotent
orbits of KC on the symmetric space pC . Therefore the following is a natural

question: Maintaining the above notations and assuming that q is θ-stable, when
does Q ∩ KC admit an open dense orbit on u ∩ pC ? This would be the equivalent
of the Richardson theorem for the real case. It turns out that this statement is
not true in general. Patrice Tauvel gave a counter example in [12] on page 652
for gC = D4 . However, he was able to prove a version of Richardson’s theorem
for polarizable parabolic subalgebras.
Deﬁnition 1. Let q = q ∩ kC ⊕ q ∩ pC be a θ stable parabolic subalgebra of gC
with Levi decomposition q = l ⊕ u. Let e be a nilpotent element of u ∩ pC . We
say that q is a polarization of gC at e if
e
2dimq = dimgC
+ dimgC
e
where gC
is the centralizer of e in gC .
A theta-stable parabolic q = l ⊕ u is said to be polarizable if there exists e ∈
u ∩ pC such that q is a polarization of gC at e.
e
Observe that since dimgC
= dimgC − dim GC .e and dimKC .e = 1/2dimGC .e the
above formula becomes:

dimq = dimgC − dimKC .e.
This is the criterion that we will use to test for polarization.
The next proposition could be seen as a version of Richardson’s theorem for
complex symmetric spaces.
Proposition 1. (P. Tauvel). Maintaining the above notations, suppose that
there exists z in pC such that q is a polarization of of gC at z. Then
i. There exists a unique KC -nilpotent orbit, Ok , in pC such that S = u∩pC ∩Ok
is an open and dense in u ∩ pC .
ii. S is a Q ∩ KC -orbit.
iii. if x ∈ S then [x, kC ∩q] = u∩pC , [x, pC ∩q] = u∩kC and q is a polarization
of gC at x.
Proof. See [12] proposition 4.6.
The orbit Ok is said to be the KC -saturation of u ∩ pC . We use the notation
Ok = KC (u ∩ pC ). A study of the proof of the above proposition reveals that if e
is in u ∩ pC and q is a polarization of gC at e then Ok = KC .e. This observation
allows us to design an algorithm for computing the KC -saturation of u∩pC when
q is polarizable.

Root Decomposition

Let h be a fundamental Cartan subalgebra of g. Then h = t ⊕ v, where t is a
Cartan subalgebra of k and v ⊆ p. We have the following decompositions in the
root spaces of gC generated by the roots of hC :

Algorithm II. The next algorithm determines whether or not a given parabolic
is polarizable. If it is polarizable then the KC -saturation of its niradical in pC
is returned. Although we use the algorithm on exceptional Lie groups it does
handle the classical cases also. The dimensions of the nilpotent orbits of the

Polarizable Theta-Stable Parabolic Subalgebras and KC -Saturation

425

exceptional complex Lie groups are given in [1] and such data are used in order
to check the polarization condition. In [5] we gave algorithms for computing
representatives of KC -nilpotent orbits for exceptional Lie groups. Djokovi´c [2]
has computed such representatives also. Each representative of a nilpotent orbit
is given as a linear combination of non zero vectors of root spaces.
We write e = cμ1 Xμ1 + . . . cμm Xμm where the μi ’s are roots to denote a representative. Furthermore, μ1 , . . . , μm√are simple roots of a reductive Lie subalgebra
of gC . For example in F4(4) , e = 2(Xα1 +2α2 +3α3 +α4 + X−α1 −α2 −α3 ) is a representative of orbit #9 in Djokovi´c’s tables and these two short roots generate
a subalgebra of type A2 . We write < e > to denote the subalgebra of rank m
generated by Re = {μ1 , . . . , μm }.
Input:
L : List of of lists of representatives of each KC orbits.
q: A theta-stable parabolic subalgebra q = l ⊕ u of gC .
Re : deﬁned above
Computation:
0. R ← {α|Xα ∈ u ∩ pC }
1. For each KC -orbit Ok Do
2. If dimq = dimgC − dim Ok Then [ q may be polarizable ]
3. For each representative e of Ok Do
4. r ← rank < e > [< e > is the subalgebra generated by e]
5. For each subset S ⊆ R
such that |S| = r and T ype(< S >) = T ype(< e >) Do
6. If S is KC - conjugate to Re Then
q is polarizable and Ok = KC (u ∩ pC )
7. Else go back to step 3.
EndIf-EndFor-EndFor
EndIf-EndFor
End.
Comments. We implement both algorithms in LiE. The ﬁrst algorithm is an
extension of the procedure discussed in [6]. A proof of correctness was given also
in that paper. A careful examination of the second algorithm should reveal that
step 6 is indeed the most costly condition on average because it may require
traversing the Weyl group of KC .
The number of KC -conjugacy classes of systems of simple roots is given by
|W (GC )|
|W (KC )| where W (GC ) and W (KC ) are the Weyl groups of GC and KC respectively. One can enumerate all such classes by successive reﬂections through non
compact imaginary roots. Thus for each class the algorithms will give a list of
theta-stable polarizable parabolic subalgebras. There could be redundancies as
some parabolic subalgebras could lie in diﬀerent classes of simple roots. However,
this problem can be easily resolve by keeping a list of distinct parabolic subalgebras. A more subtle problem is to decide when two theta parabolic subalgebras

426

S.G. Jackson and A.G. No¨el

are conjugate under KC which may require traversing W (KC ). Keep in mind
that in general W (KC ), although ﬁnite, could be large. This situation is under
investigation.
Finally, we shall discuss an important conjecture in Representation theory.
Certain complex nilpotent orbits are said to be special. For a deﬁnition of the
term special in this context see [1], [10]. Special nilpotent orbits are the building
blocks of the celebrated Springer’s correspondence which relate nilpotent orbits
to Representation theory. The Wave Front theory (See [4]) suggests that the KC saturation is always a connected component of a special nilpotent complex orbit.
Mo¨eglin [4] proved that the conjecture is true for classical p-adic groups. Trapa
[13] seems to have a proof for classical real Lie groups. The results below support the conjecture for polarizable parabolic subalgebras; all the KC -saturations
obtained come from special complex nilpotent orbits of GC on gC .

We order the roots of F4 as in the table below and we use the Bourbaki system of
simple roots Δ = {α1 , α2 , α3 , α4 }. The Cartan involution θ with +1-eigenspace k
and −1-eigenspace p depends on the real forms. If g = F4(4) then kC = sp3 (C) ⊕
sl2 (C) and the vector space pC is the complex span of non-zero root vectors
Xβ where β = c1 α1 + c2 α2 + c3 α3 + c4 α4 with c1 = ±1. If g = F4(−20) then

Conclusion

The results presented in this paper are the output of an implementation of the
above algorithms in the language LiE [14]. We choose this language because it
contains many basic functions that can be used in such investigations. We are
also quite familiar with the accuracy and the speed of its underlying algorithms.
We have not implemented our algorithms in other languages. It would be an interesting exercise to produce implementations in GAP, Mathematica or Mapple.
One of the reviewers wanted to know whether or not our program can be used
to produce counter-examples similar to the one given by Tauvel. Although this
is a clever suggestion, we did not pursue it. However, we think that it is worth
pointing out that Richardson’s theorem holds for sln (IR).
