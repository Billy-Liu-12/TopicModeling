Abstract. To regulate the switch effect induced by NH- anion substitution at the
H8 site of the guanine-cytosine (GC) watson-crick pair and investigate the actual
state in the solution, 1-9 water molecules attached GNH-C derivatives are probed
in the present paper. Results show that the switch effect, i.e., deformation effect
of hydrogen bonding between GNH- and C pair reduces step-wise as the number
of discrete water molecules around the NH- group increases. Thus one can
control the switch action of GNH-C by regulating the number of water molecules
around the NH- group.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen bonding in the DNA pairs plays a vital role, thus it has been the subject of
biological theory chemists [1-13]. These hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), which are
extensively studied, mainly locate between guanine and cytosine (GC pair) [6-8,11-13]
and between adenine and thymine (AT pair) [1, 4, 12]. Recently, Bickelhaupt group [1]
reported an interesting observation that, when the H8 site of guanine species or the H6
site of cytosine species in the GC pair was substituted by an anion or cation, the
H-bonds between G and C would deform and take on switch action. Similar actions are
also reported in other literatures [6-8, 11-13]. The action can be described as follows
from two models in Fig. 1. The O6…H4΄-N4΄ distance will shorten and, N1-H1…N3΄
and N2-H2…N2΄distances, especially the latter will be elongated when the H8 is
substituted by an anion, however. On the other hand, the change trend of above three
distances will reverse when the H6΄ of cytosine is substituted by a cation (See GC in
Fig.1). These action looks like a switch.
In the present paper, we will probe how to regulate the switch by attaching water
molecules stepwise around the substituted anion based one of the Bickelhaupt et al’
models, NH- substituted GC (GNH-C). The optimized structure of GNH-C is also
displayed in Fig.1.
The geometry optimizations and frequency calculations of all these hydrated
complexes (1-9hydrates) are performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* [14] level. The serial
number of each atom in the GC and GNH-C are shown in the Fig.1. All calculations are
carried out with the GAUSSIAN 03 package of program Revision C.02 [15].

2 Results and Discussions
Table 1 lists the distances of three H-bonds, O6…H4'-N4', N1-H1…N3' and
N2-H2…O2' of optimized GC and GNH-C in the gas phase. Results reveal that the
H-bonding distances are consistent well with those from Ref[1] though the
Ref[1]-values obtained at the BP86/TZ2P level are smaller somewhat than our results
due to the difference of calculation methods.

2.1 Hydration Schemes of GNH-C and Regulation Effect of Hydration
The switch action of GNH-C derives from the electronic effect of the substituted anion
[1-2,6-8], thus hydration around the anion site (NH- group) can effectively regulate the
action of the corresponding complex and is selected. The essential principle of attaching
these water molecules is keeping the balance between these hydrated complexes minima
in energy and larger recovery in distances of three H-bonds. The structural coordinates
and relative energies of each hydrate series for (1-9) hydrated complexes are displayed in
the supporting information (SP).
The change trend of the three H-bonds along the number of water molecules attached is
displayed Fig. 2. It is noted that the distances displayed in the figure are those from the
most stable complex GNH-CnW1 of each hydrate series. The distances of three H-bonds of
GC and GNH-C, two non-hydrated complexes, are shown in a vertical line in the figure and
correspond to the “0” position of horizontal axis. For any of the three plots, there are two
points in the vertical line corresponding to the “0” position. The top point in the black plot
corresponds to O6…H4'-N4' distance in GC, while the bottom point to the distance in
GNH-C. Thus the distance between the two points indicates the shortening of O6…H4'-N4'
distance of GC induced by NH- anion. The following points reveal that the shortening is
recovered by gradually increased hydration. The top points at the “0” position respective

in the red and green plots, however, correspond to the distances N1-H1…N3' and
N2-H2…O2' of GNH-C, while two bottom points to the corresponding distances in GC.
Thus their differences of the identical plot indicate the elongating of the distance
N1-H1…N3' or N2-H2…O2' induced by the anion in GC. Stepwise hydration also makes
the differences decrease and the octahydrated case appears to reach optimal recovery.

3 Conclusions
1-9 water molecules bound GNH-C complexes are probed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.
Results reveal that the regulation effect from the local hydration is obvious. Up to 8 water
molecules, the regulation effect reaches optimal though the deformation of H-bonds has
not recovered into the state of neutral GC completely. The regulation effect is improved
gradually along with the increase of locally (anion) hydrated molecule number. The trend
is doubtless and can be observed intuitively from Fig.2 though there may be other more
stable hydrated structures missed for each hydrate series discussed in the paper.
