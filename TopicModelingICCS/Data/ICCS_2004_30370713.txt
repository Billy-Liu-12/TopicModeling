Abstract. In this paper, Dynamic structure neural network controller based on
feedback linearization is proposed. The proposed method can adapt the neural
network structure dynamically while it can guarantee the stability and tracking
precision of system.

1 Introduction
Neural network provides a nice form for describing the nonlinear characteristic of
systems in certain degree and it has the vast vistas in the control of nonlinear systems
[1,2,3]. There is a strong appeal to the research field of nonlinear control theory and
neural network control if combining neural network with nonlinear adaptive control
[4,5]. But there is the short of systematic study on the stability and robust property for
the nonlinear neural network control system so far. In this note, we will propose an
efficient approach to combine the dynamic structure neural network algorithm with
adaptive feedback linearization. The algorithm of dynamic structure neural network
controller is given and the stability of system is analyzed. It is satisfactory with the
results of system simulation.

Where X ∈ R n , y p and u are the state, output and control input variables respectively.
If the order and relative degree of system (1) are n and r, then we let

Generally, the objective of control system for (1) is to find the control law u so that
the outputs of system follow the reference trajectory y m . The relative degree of
reference model n is greater than r . For minimum-phase system, we let

system, we take the control law

u = u al + u sl , u al = 1 (− fˆ ( x) + v )

and u sl is sliding controller.
f ( X ), g ( X ) are the approaches of f1 ( X ), g1 ( X ) respectively. Using the method of [1],
we let
(6)
fˆ ( X ) = m( X )Wˆ fT Φ f ( X ) + f o ( X ), gˆ ( X ) = m( X )Wˆ gT Φ g ( X ) + g o ( X )
where Φ f (X ) and
Wˆ g are

Φ g (X ) are

the output of hidden layers of neural network and

Wˆ f

,

the parameters of corresponding output layers.

Using the method of feedback linearization, the state locus of system is in the subspace Ad of the state space. It can be decided by reference model. Neural network is
only employed to approach the characteristic of system in subspace Ad . To ensure
safety we expand the approximation area to A where Ad ⊂ A . The m(x) expresses the
switch function to control neural network so that neural network only approaches the
characteristic of system in subspace A. It is defined as

m( X ) = 0 − 1



X ∈ Ad

X ∈ ( A − Ad )
X ∉ Ad

The f o , g o are the known characteristic of f 1 , g 1 receptively.
According to the approaching theory of neural network, we have:
Supposition (1) for any ε f , ε g ∈ R + and f o , g o there exist W f* , W g* and m(X) so that for
any x ∈ A in (6) satisfy
∆f = f * ( X ) − f 1 ( X ) ≤ ε f , ∆g = g * ( X ) − g 1 ( X ) ≤ ε g

(8)

f * = fˆ (W f* , X ), ∆f = f * ( X ) − f 1 ( X ), g * = gˆ (W g* , X ), ∆g = g * ( X ) − g1 ( X )

where
The neurons in dynamic structure neural network can be regarded as to be chosen
from the set of candidate neural neurons. The set of all candidate neurons is Kpot
which is determined according to the properties of hidden layer neurons and the
property of system. The neurons in Kpot can be divided into three sets, 1) inactive
neurons Kp; 2) active neurons to be removed from neural network Kd; 3) active
neurons to be kept in the neural networks Ka. Then, we have

and system order n=2, relative degree r=1.
The reference model is y d = 1 /(1 + s / 10) 3 and its input is the square wave with 0.4
Hz frequency and 0.9 amplitude. Let β 1 = 1, α r = k d = 5, φ = 0.005 .
From the reference model, we can know that the state locus of system is in the region
of [-1,1]*[-1,1]. So, we can take Ad = [−1,1] × [−1,1], A = [−1.5,1.5] × [−1.5,1.5] .
In system simulation, the neural network controller based on dynamic structure
wavelet network is employed. The 2-d mother wavelet ψ ( X ) = (2 − X 2 ) exp(− X 2 / 2) .
And the corresponding 2-D wavelet frame is ψ p, K ( X ) = a o − pn / 2ψ (a o − p X − diag ( K )bo ) .
Where p ∈ Z , K ∈ Z 2 are the scale and translation coefficients. And a o = 2, bo = 1 ,
p ∈ [−1,4] . The range of K is chosen so that a o p bo K ∈ A .
The adaptive rate of neural network η f = η g = 25 . The structure adaptive law
coefficients are u f = 1, u g = 5, θ f = 3, θ g = 15, f o = 0, g o = 1.9, g l = 0.895 . The sliding
mode controller is k sl = 0.5 and the initial states of system are X(0)=[1,1] T.

The simulated results are given in Figs. 1 and 2. It shows that the neural network
structure is dynamic and tending towards stable and the tracking error of system is
reaching the required zone after 10 seconds. The neural network sizes for
approximating f ( X ), g ( X ) are 40 and 8. While, f ( X ) and g ( X ) are approached using
1403 and 556 RBF neurons in [3] and [5] respectively. It is illustrated that the size of
neural network is decreased greatly using the dynamic structure wavelet network.
