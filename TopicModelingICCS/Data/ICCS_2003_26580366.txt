Abstract. The recent discovery of benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar clouds has increased the interest in
this entire class of molecules, which result to be the object of several theoretical and experimental investigations. In this work, we have studied the
reactions of the phenylium, C6 H5 + , and the naphtylium cation, C10 H7 + ,
with D2 . All calculations have been carried out at B3LYP/6-31G* level
of theory and they suggest that the addition products, C6 H5 D2 + and
C10 H7 D2 + , once formed, can be stabilized by unreactive collisions or
lose a neutral molecule (H2 or HD) or an atom (H or D), respectively.

Introduction

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been postulated to be an important, ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium based on their high
stability against UV radiation. Many members of this class have been already
studied [2] [3] [4] , even though most of the available information principally concerns the smallest terms of this class, like benzene [5] and naphtalene [6] . By
experimental investigations, it has been demonstrated that PAHs are expected
to be present as a mixture of free, neutral and ionized gas phase molecules [7] following a large size distribution from small systems (less than 25 carbon atoms)
to large graphitic plateles. They can be present both in their neutral and/or ionized forms and are thought to be the origin of a variety of interstellar infrared
emission features observed in the 700 to 3100 cm−1 range. Recent experimental studies of reactions of the PAHs cations C6 H6 + and C10 H8 + with H atoms
[1] [8] [9]
have shown that association channels are dominant and they lead to
observable quantities of protonated PAHs. In the same studies, it was also noticed that the cations C6 H5 + and C10 H7 + did not react with atomic hydrogen
whereas they showed particular reactivity towards the hydrogen molecules with
a supposed association mechanism [1] [8] [9] . Such kind of reactions, in which
PAHs and atomic or molecular hydrogen are involved, are generally postulated
to be of fundamental importance in numerous processes which can take place in
the interstellar medium [3] .
In this paper, we will show the results of our theoretical investigations on
the reactions [C6 H5 + + D2 ] and [C10 H7 + + D2 ]. The direct addition of D2 to

the cations of interest immediately leads to the formation of the intermediates
C6 H5 D2 + and C10 H7 D2 + and both these processes result to be strongly exothermic. These addition complexes may either be stabilized by unreactive collisions
or dissociate by losing H2 (or HD) in the case of C6 H5 D2 + and H (or D) for the
latter cation [10] .

Theoretical Methods

Calculations have been carried out with the B3LYP hybrid exchange correlation
functional [11] as implemented in GAUSSIAN98 [12] in conjunction with the 631G* basis set [13] . For all the species involved in the investigated reactions,
we have optimized their geometries and computed their harmonic frequencies,
in order to confirm the presence of either a minimum or a saddle point. All
thermochemical calculations have been carried out at 298.15 K and 1 atm by
adding, for each species, the zero point correction and the thermal corrections
to enthalpy and Gibbs free energy to the calculated B3LYP values. The zero
point correction to energy has been considered so that we could evaluate the
thermochemistry of our reactions in conditions which are closer to the interstellar
ones, since they are characterized by much lower values of temperature.

C6 H5 + + D2

The relative abundant literature information on the existence and reactivity of
the phenylium cation, C6 H5 + , indicates that it can be generated by electron
impact on benzene [14] and two isomeric structures are known to exist for this
cation. They are thought to be the cyclic and linear isomers which are readily
distinguished by their different reactivities. While linear C6 H5 + reacts neither
with H2 nor with H, a reaction between H2 and cyclic C6 H5 + was observed
in several studies [14] [15] . The reaction with D2 was already experimentally
investigated by Sablier et al. [16] . The cyclic C6 H5 + can exist both in a triplet
and a singlet state and we calculated the latter to be more stable by 0.81 eV. In
Figure 1, we report a schematic representation of the potential energy surface
for the association of D2 to the phenylium cation and two different mechanisms
may be hypothesized.
According to the results on the [C6 H5 + H2 ] reaction [17] , the process of
interest with D2 should first proceed by the deuterium abstraction mechanism
to form [C6 H5 D+ + D]; successively, the deuterium addition to C6 H5 D+ would
give the intermediate of interest. The triplet state C6 H5 + can add the deuterium
molecule with this proposed mechanism. For the abstraction step, the transition
state found on the potential energy surface gives rise to a barrier height of 0.13
eV. The second D atom approaches the C6 H5 D+ intermediate out of the plane
of the ring and this addition is exothermic by 3.41 eV and barrierless [18] [19] .
This result is understandable in terms of the electronic structures of the ions
involved. The radical cations, with their highly reactive, open-shell structures,
readily add a deuterium atom to produce the intermediate C6 H5 D2 + with a

more favourable closed-shell electron configuration (singlet state, see Fig. 1). The
resultant cation is far less reactive with D (or H) atoms because it already has
the preferred closed-shell electron structure and the addition of a second atom
would brake this favourable configuration. The singlet isomer does not exibit the
same behaviour and this result is rather foreseeable, since the abstraction step
is endothermic of 0.46 eV. It will prefer adding D2 in a direct 1,1-association
mechanism. This addition can be rationalized as an insertion process involving
the D-D bond and the vacant sp2 orbital on the ipso carbon of the phenylium
ion. Furthermore, it does not require any energetic barrier and this result is also
supported by a similar investigation carried out on the 1,1-elimination process
[18]
. The exothermicity for this mechanism is computed to be 2.95 eV.
The intermediate C6 H5 D2 + , once formed, can either be stabilized by unreactive collisions with D2 or form C6 H3 D2 + and C6 H4 D+ by losing either H2 or HD,
or, finally, it could reform the reactants by releasing D2 [10] . So as to rationalize
the experimental data, we focussed on the fate of the C6 H5 D2 + intermediate. In
Figure 2, we show the potential energy surface of the C6 H5 D2 + intermediate at
B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.
By considering the cation C6 H5 D2 + a , which is the species directly formed
from the phenylium ion according to the mechanism previously described, a 1-2
deuterium shift can be observed, with the consequent formation of the intermediate C6 H5 D2 + b . The barrier is 0.55 eV at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.
C6 H5 D2 + b evolves in different manners; firstly, it can lose a HD molecule in a
barrierless process and form C6 H4 D+ (∆H= 2.92 eV). Alternatively, by a fur-

ther shift of a D atom, it can evolve into C6 H5 D2 + c with an activation barrier
of 0.55 eV. Finally, a hydrogen shift can be considered with the formation of
C6 H5 D2 + e and the energetic barrier of this third process is 0.52 eV. At this
point, C6 H5 D2 + e will be able either to lose a H2 molecule forming C6 H3 D2 +
(∆H= 2.88 eV) or to shift a further H atom to give C6 H5 D2 + f . In Table 1, we
present the energetics for all the reactions drawn in Figure 2, reporting their
∆E0 , ∆H, ∆G and Ea values at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.
By comparing the thermochemical values for the loss of HD and H2 from
the intermediate C6 H5 D2 + with the exothermicity of the association reaction
[C6 H5 + + D2 ] (2.95 eV), the production of C6 H4 D+ and C6 H3 D2 + results to
be exothermic by 0.03 eV and 0.07 eV with respect to the reactants, explaining, thus, their presence in the experimental apparatus [10] . However, it is also
worth noticing that all the activation barriers for the isomerization processes

370

lie much lower in energy than the release of a neutral molecule. Therefore our
calculations can rationalize why in the experimental analysis large concentrations of C6 H5 D2 + were detected together with lower quantities of C6 H4 D+ and
C6 H3 D2 + [10] .

C10 H7 + + D2

In analogy with C6 H5 + , even the naphtylium cation, C10 H7 + , is known to react
with the H2 molecule, whereas no reactions occur with atoms [8] [9] . Previous
theoretical calculations on the naphtylium cation indicated this species is planar
with the positive charge largely delocalized on the deprotonated ring [20] and
our B3LYP/6-31G* calculations are in good agreement with these results. Then,
we have been able to locate two different isomers of C10 H7 + and they can be
indicated as C10 H7 + -α and C10 H7 + -β, where α and β denote the sites where
the hydrogen atom has been abstracted (see Figure 3).
Although they result to be both planar, the abstraction of a H atom destroys
the aromaticity of the naphtalene π system and they own only a CS symmetry.

Fig. 3. Schematic representation of C10 H7 + -α and C10 H7 + -β

By a comparison of their energies, the C10 H7 + -α isomer is more stable than
β by nearly 0.058 eV and, by calculating the energies of the C10 H7 D2 + -α and
C10 H7 D2 + -β intermediates, which can be directly originated from the previous
reactants by D2 addition, the α isomer results to be lower in energy by 0.13 eV.
We can therefore assume that our process of interest will principally involve the
α isomers. The association reaction [C10 H7 + + H2 ] is known to occur under low
density conditions [1] [8] [9] . Additional information is available on the reaction
[C10 H8 + + H] [21] . Ho et al. [22] supposed the reaction [C10 H7 + + H2 → C10 H8 +
+ H] to be slightly endothermic, while our calculations suggest the same process
to be exothermic by 0.34 eV. When D2 reacts with the naphtylium cation, the
intermediate C10 H7 D2 + is mainly produced with lower quantities of the cationic
species C10 H7 D+ and C10 H6 D2 + which could be formed by the further loss of a
D or a H atom respectively [10] .
On the D2 addition to C10 H7 + , we have optimized a transition state for the
abstraction-addition mechanism (Ea = 0.17 eV), whereas the 1,1-addition is a
barrierless process exothermic by 3.17 eV. In Figure 4, we report a schematic
representation of the C10 H7 D2 + potential energy surface, where we concentrate
only on the possible shifts of a deuterium atom around the molecular rings. Ten
different structural isomers have been optimized and they all reveal comparable
stabilities, except those cations in which the coordination of the deuterium atom
involves the carbons in common with the two six-membered rings. These latest
species have been indicated by the letters e and f and they can only lose the D
atom to form the C10 H7 D+ cations. At this point of the study, we focussed our
attention only to the shifts involving the D atoms, without considering the same
phenomenon in the case of the H atoms (see Figure 4).
As shown in Figure 4, by starting from C10 H7 D2 + a , which is our initial
isomer, three different pathways can be followed. Firstly, we can consider the
breaking of a C-D bond with the formation of C10 H7 D+ and this reaction is
endothermic by 2.82 eV. Alternatively, C10 H7 D2 + b is formed: this reaction is
slightly endothermic and it requires an activation barrier of 0.72 eV. The cation
b can evolve by losing either a D (∆H= 2.69 eV) or a H atom (∆H= 2.61 eV) or
give C10 H7 D2 + c . A third possible channel involves the isomerization C10 H7 D2 + a
→ C10 H7 D2 + f with an activation energy of 1.10 eV. In Table 2, we report the
thermochemical parameters for all the processes drawn in Figure 4, considering
both the activation barriers and the loss of the D and H atoms.
As we can observe in Table 2, the activation energies for the investigated
isomerization processes result to be lower than the calculated values for the

372

loss of the D and H atoms from the same intermediates. This result implies that
C10 H7 D2 + , once formed, can easily allow the atomic shifts all along its structure
with the consequent formation of a remarkable number of isomers which differ
one another for the position of the isotopically labelled atoms.

Conclusions

In this paper, we present a theoretical study at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory of
the reactions [C6 H5 + + D2 ] and [C10 H7 + + D2 ]. They both involve PAHs and
the deuterium molecule, which are well-known constituents of the interstellar
clouds. The 1,1-addition of the D2 molecule to the phenylium and naphtylium
cations does not require any activation energy and the products of this reactions
are the experimentally revealed cations C6 H5 D2 + and C10 H7 D2 + . The fate of
these two species is different. From the experimental results on both systems [10] ,
it was noticed that the intermediate C6 H5 D2 + could dissociate by losing either

374

M. Di Stefano, M. Rosi, and A. Sgamellotti

a HD or a H2 molecule giving the cations C6 H4 D+ and C6 H3 D2 + , whereas the
intermediate C10 H7 D2 + could lose a H atom forming C10 H6 D2 + or a D atom
with the consequent synthesis of C10 H7 D+ . All our calculations rationalize these
surveys and, in addiction, offer a more complete view of the possible reactive
pathways which may be followed by both the systems of interest.
