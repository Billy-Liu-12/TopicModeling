Abstract
This paper analyses numerically the electric ﬁeld distribution of a liquid contained in a Petri dish when exposed to electromagnetic waves excited in a rectangular waveguide. Solutions exhibit high-gradients due to the presence of the dielectric liquid
contained in the dish. Furthermore, electromagnetic ﬁelds within the dielectric have a dramatically lower value than on the
remaining part of the domain, which diﬃcults its simulation. Additionally, various singularities of diﬀerent intensity appear
along the boundary of the Petri dish. To properly reproduce and numerically study those eﬀects, we employ a highly-accurate
hp-adaptive ﬁnite element method. Results of this study demonstrate that the electric ﬁeld generated within the circular Petri
dish is non-homogeneous, and thus, a better shape, size, or location of the dish is needed to achieve an equally distributed
radiation enabling the uniform growth of cell cultives.

1. Introduction
Since the German bacteriologist Julius Richard Petri proposed the use of the so-called Petri dish in the year
1887, its use has been widely extended among biologists to control the growth of a variety of cell cultives (see,
for example, [1, 2]). It is often the case that the liquid contained within the dish is exposed to an artiﬁcial electromagnetic radiation that produces a source of heat, thus, facilitating and expediting the growth of the cell cultive.
In multiple occasions, this radiation is attained by placing the dish within a waveguide that is electromagnetically excited through one of its ports. Ideally, the dish should be subject to a homogeneous electromagnetic ﬁeld
distribution, although in practice, this objective is rarely achieved.
In here, we study in detail via numerical simulations the spatial electrical distribution within the Petri dish
resulting from its exposition to electromagnetic radiation in a rectangular waveguide. We consider the geometry
depicted in Figure 1. Since our model problem is symmetric, in addition to the full problem, we shall also model

half of the problem equipped with symmetry boundary conditions.
A preliminary numerical study of a Petri dish exposed to electromagnetic radiation can be found in [3]. In
here, we employ a more accurate numerical method based on a three-dimensional (3D) fully automatic hp-adaptive
FEM that enables a more accurate description of the resulting electromagnetic ﬁelds within the dish. This method
combines the geometrical ﬂexibility of a FEM with an accuracy that is superior to that provided by other numerical (and often even semi-analytical) methods. The resulting meshes delivered automatically by the hp-adaptive
strategy adapt to the problem of interest. This grid-reﬁnement strategy eﬃciently deals with diﬀerent types of
singularities appearing in the simulation of the Petri dish problem. Moreover, the dispersion (pollution) error is
also automatically minimized by increasing the polynomial order of approximation, and therefore, the method is
also suitable for eﬃciently solving the problem at a high-frequency regime.
This study serves as an initial design step towards optimizing the shape, size, number, and/or location of a
Petri dish in order to homogenize the spatial distribution of the electric ﬁeld within the dish. Additionally, it also
illustrates the performance of the hp-adaptive strategy in real-life three-dimensional problems that simultaneously
exhibit multiple singularities and high-gradients in the solution.
In the following, we derive the variational formulation, we introduce the numerical method, and we show the
main results of our extensive numerical experimentation.
2. Mathematical Formulation
For a nonzero time-harmonic excitation (ω
and Faraday’s laws, given by:
∇×E=
∇×H=

0) in the frequency domain, our problem is governed by Amp´ere

− jωμH
( jωε + σ)E + Jimp

(Faraday’s law),
(Amp´ere’s law),
√
where E and H are the electric and magnetic ﬁeld, respectively, j = −1 is the imaginary unit, Jimp is the
impressed volumetric electric current, σ is the conductivity of the media, and and μ are the electric permittivity
and magnetic permeability of the medium, respectively. By convention, we express = r 0 and μ = μr μ0 , where
the 0-subscript denotes the material properties in vacuum, and the r-subscript indicates the relative factor in the
actual material. In the application considered in this paper, both Jimp and σ are equal to zero, r is equal to 77
within the Petri dish and 1 in the remaining part of the domain, and μr is equal to 1 everywhere. The frequency of

1557

operation is f = ω/(2 ∗ pi) = 2.368 GHz. The excitation of the problem is imposed via a boundary condition at
the incident port, namely:
ω2 μ
1
nˆ × nˆ × H = Uin at the port boundary (Γin )
nˆ × ∇ × H + j
ε
β10

(1)

where nˆ is the unit vector normal (and outward) to Γ, β10 is equal to 2π divided by the wavelength within the
waveguide, and Uin is deﬁned as
k2
nˆ × nˆ × Hin
(2)
Uin = j
εβ10
with Hin being the incident magnetic ﬁeld at the port.
For the exit port Γex , we employ the same condition with Hin = 0, which becomes an absorbing boundary
conditions for the considered example, where the only present mode with non-negligible amplitude at the exit
port is the so-called TE10 mode. The remaining modes are evanescent: their amplitude diminish exponentially
as a function of the distance to the Petri dish. The waveguide walls are modeled via perfect electric boundary
conditions:
1
nˆ × ∇ × H = 0,
ε

at perfect electric conductors (ΓN )

(3)

The above system of two ﬁrst order PDE’s can be further simpliﬁed to a single second order PDE in terms of
magnetic ﬁeld H by taking the curl of Amp´ere’s law pre-multiplied by 1/ and using Faraday’s law to obtain the
so called reduced wave equation:
1
∇ × ∇ × H − ω2 μH = 0
(4)
ε
The standard variational formulation is obtained by multiplying (4) by a test function F ∈ H(curl, Ω) = {F ∈
L2 (Ω) : ∇×F ∈ L2 (Ω)}, integrating by parts, and incorporating the boundary conditions to obtain:
1
(∇ × F) · ( ∇ × H) dΩ − ω2
ε

F · μH dΩ + j

ω2 μ

(nˆ × F) · (nˆ × H) dΓ = 2 j

ω2 μ

Γin

(nˆ × F) · (nˆ × Hin ) dΓ.
(5)

The electric ﬁeld is computed by postprocessing the magnetic ﬁeld using Amp´ere’s law. Alternatively, one could
directly derive a similar variational formulation in terms of the electric ﬁeld.
3. hp Finite Elements and Automatic Adaptivity
For the numerical simulations, we employ a three-dimensional hp-adaptive ﬁnite element method [4, 5], where
both the element size h and polynomial order of approximation p vary locally throughout the grid. The optimal
distribution of element size h and polynomial order of approximation p is decided based on a self-adaptive strategy
devised in [6] and further improved in [7, 5, 8]. This strategy utilizes as one of its main building blocks the
projection based interpolation operator [9, 10]. The main advantage of this method is that it provides exponential
convergence in terms of the energy-norm error vs. the problem size (see [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]), while it also
minimizes the dispersion error in wave propagation problems due to the use of high p (see [18, 19, 20]).
4. Numerical Results
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation results, we start by analyzing the convergence of the hpadaptive ﬁnite element method. In waveguide simulations, it is customary to measure the so-called scattering
matrix S , whose entries S i j indicate the amount of energy measured at port j when the i-th port is excited [8].
Figure 2 displays the convergence history of S 11 and S 21 for the symmetric (using symmetry boundary conditions)
and full models. Results for S 12 and S 22 are similar and omitted here for brevity. These graphics conﬁrm the
high-accuracy delivered by the adaptive method. After a quick initial descend of the error in the pre-asymptotic

1558

regime, the method stabilizes in the asymptotic regime with an exponentially fast convergence, as indicated by the
obtained straight lines in the displayed scale. The initial, one intermediate, and ﬁnal hp-grids corresponding to
the full and symmetric models are displayed in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. We observe diﬀerent ﬁnal grids for
the symmetric and full models due to the extreme sensitivity of the reﬁnement strategy to the initial grid, which is
diﬀerent for each model. Nevertheless, ﬁnal hp-grids in both models exhibit similar trends. In particular, heavy hand p- reﬁnements appear in the proximity of the Petri dish, as physically expected due to the singular behavior
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds in that area of the domain.

Errors (in absolute value) are estimated using a reference solution obtained from a globally reﬁned hp-grid.

The energy distribution expressed in terms of |E|2 (V 2 /m2 ) over the Petri dish at diﬀerent cut-oﬀ planes is
displayed in Figure 5. We observe large variations on the electric ﬁeld distribution along all spatial directions.
This implies that the cell cultive will be subject to diﬀerent heat levels, which is undesired. A more precise
description of these undesired variations in the electric ﬁeld can be observed in Figure 6, where we display some
of its components. We conclude that the electric ﬁeld experiments an abrupt variation (high gradients) around
the dish boundary. This eﬀect, is further observed in Figure 7, where we clearly visualize the singularities that
develop at the corners of the Petri dish.
5. Discussion of Results and Conclusions
Results indicate that the electromagnetic ﬁelds rapidly vary in the proximity of the boundary of the Petri
dish. Speciﬁcally, their amplitude signiﬁcantly decrease within the dielectric dish. This low-intensity ﬁeld also
has important variations in both vertical and horizontal directions, which is an undesired situation for the proper
growth of cell cultives. Thus, it is convenient to modify the shape and/or location of the Petri dish in order to
recover a more homogeneous ﬁeld distribution within the Petri dish.
The use of adaptive methods is necessary to accurately model the spatial distribution of the electric ﬁeld within
the Petri dish, since it is surrounded by a higher-energy ﬁeld that contains singularities and high-gradients.
