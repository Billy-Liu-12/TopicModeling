Abstract
In this paper we will present early work on using a DDDAS based approach to the construction of probabilistic
estimates of volcanic ash transport and dispersal. Our primary modeling tools will be a combination of a plume
eruption model BENT and the ash transport model PUFF. Data from satellite imagery, observation of vent parameters
and windﬁelds will drive our simulations. We will use uncertainty quantiﬁcation methodology – polynomial chaos
quadrature in combination with data integration to complete the DDDAS loop.
Keywords: DDDAS, Volcanic Ash Transport, Uncertainty Quantiﬁcation

1. Introduction
The dynamic data driven application system paradigm (DDDAS) is formally deﬁned in a series of recent reports
[1, 2] and in earlier reports on the subject as systems where data are dynamically integrated into simulation(s) to
augment or complement the application model, and, where conversely the executing simulation steers the measurement (instrumentation and control) processes of the application system. The full range of research issues raised by
the DDDAS paradigm are many and diverse. We describe here the construction of a framework for DDDAS to target
predictions of ash clouds that are produced by explosive eruptions from volcanoes and address primarily questions
related to the quantiﬁcation of uncertainty and a computational strategy for data driven forecasts using large scale
computing and analytics. The motivation of the research proposed here will be to develop techniques that can be
completed in a timely fashion to enable the DDDAS control loop on the simulation and observation, thus, greatly
enhancing the quality of the prediction. Recent eruptions of Eyjafjallaj¨okullin Iceland and Puyehue in Chile illustrate
the potential of these events to interrupt aviation. Our goal is to provide timely and accurate ash cloud forecasts to
minimize these disruptions.

Our core approach is to use weighted ensembles of a novel coupling of an eruption column model bent and the
popular puff tool as our simulation tool inside a DDDAS loop. Infrared and visual satellite imagery can provide data
on the position of these clouds. However, both simulation and observation are subject to large error and uncertainty.
Thus, we will develop methodology to carefully characterize the error and uncertainties in a timely fashion. Our
proposed techniques, if successful will greatly improve the quality of information available on the potential location
and concentrations of the ash clouds. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current and planned eﬀorts and
preliminary results in implementing a DDDAS approach to this problem domain. In a companion paper [3] we outline
in detail one of the critical phases – fast solution of the inverse problem to identify and update the inputs based on
observations.
2. Background
2.1. Volcanic Plumes
Long-range volcanic ash transport models [4] have been given the general name Volcanic Ash Transport and
Dispersion Models (VATDMs). Numerous VATDMs have been developed by both civil and military aviation or meteorological agencies to provide forecasts of ash cloud motion [5]. The use of these models became well-known
following the eruption of Eyjafjallaj¨okull, Iceland, in April, 2010, when the NAME model [6] forecasts were particularly prominent in being used as the basis for an almost complete shutdown of European air traﬃc. In this paper, we
consider a VATDM named puff that is used by the Anchorage Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) for real-time
civil aviation forecasts. Tanaka [7] and Searcy et al. [8] developed puff for predicting the paths of volcanic clouds
at meso- and synoptic scales. puff simpliﬁes the eruption plume to a vertical source, and uses a Lagrangian pseudoparticle representation of the ash cloud in a detailed 3-D regional windﬁeld to determine the trajectory of the cloud.
puff and other dispersion models have proven extremely useful in modeling the distal transport of ash for aviation
safety [8, 5]. While the work reported here is in the context of puff the statistical and stochastic methodology that
will be developed is independent of the puff model, and could be directly applied using other dispersion models. We
are in the process of implementing this methodology with the more recently formulated WRF-CHEM tool.
2.2. puff Simulation Model
There are over a dozen operational VATDMs in existence that have been used for ash cloud forecasting and postevent analysis by the world’s nine VAACs [9, 5, 10, 11]. puff is one of these VATDMs, and is particularly tied to
usage by the Anchorage VAAC. The model is intended to be a rapid response prediction tool of modest complexity,
that runs on workstation-class computers. Unlike other VATD models, it is designed solely for predictions of ash-cloud
movement in space and time, and it generates displays that can be tailored to user needs at volcano observatories, in
a real-time setting during an eruption crisis. For these reasons,puff is necessarily simple by design, but it can be
intricate in its implementation. The model takes into account the predominant physical processes that control particle
movement, such as winds, dispersion and settling, but it does not account for small scale physical processes that play
a lesser role. In some cases we do not understand in detail how these sub-scale process impact the overall cloud
movement (e.g. inter-particle interactions), in other cases the required information may not be available in a real-time
situation (e.g. precipitation), and in yet other cases inclusion of the process may signiﬁcantly lengthen model run-time
(e.g. radiative heating).
During an eruption crisis, puff predictions have been used to estimate ash cloud movement critical to the assessment of potential impacts – for example, on aircraft ﬂight paths, or on ash fall at airports, or for health concerns. As
other more complicated (and thus slower) VATD model results become available they can be incorporated into an
impact analysis by volcanologists and atmospheric scientists. Thus, uncertainty analysis and data driven correction of
VATD models in general, and of the puff model in particular, is important for appropriate response to the resulting
hazards.
puff can be run using one of several numerical weather prediction (NWP) windﬁelds [12–15]. These NWP
models are available at diﬀering levels of spatial and temporal resolution; local use of the WRF (Weather Research
Forecast) model will allow for customizing the model domains used for veriﬁcation and validation. puff tracks a

ﬁnite number of Lagrangian point particles of diﬀerent sizes, whose location R is propagated from timestep k to
timestep k + 1 via an advection/diﬀusion equation
Ri (tk+1 ) = Ri (tk ) + W(tk )Δt + Z(tk )Δt + S i (tk )Δt

(1)

Here Ri (tk ) is the position vector of the ith particle at time kΔt, W(tk ) is the local wind velocity at the location of the
ith particle, Z(tk ) is a turbulent diﬀusion that is modeled as a random walk, and S i (tk ) is a source term which models
the fallout of the ith particle due to gravity.
Ash loading and plume height are thought to be the most important input variables for volcanic ash transport and
dispersion (VATD) modeling, such as that applied to the Eyjafjallajokull plume [16]. Current usage is to derive mass
loading from the product of eruption duration and mass eruption rate (MER) (equivalent to mass ﬂux, Q). MER in
turn is typically calculated from an empirical relationship derived for strong plumes (w >> v), e.g., HT = 1.67Q0.259
[17], where w is characteristic plume speed (m/s), v is wind speed, HT is eruption column height (km) and Q is
mass eruption rate given as the equivalent volume eruption rate (cu m/s) assuming a magmatic density (for e.g. 3000
kg/cu m for basalt in the case of Eyjafjallajokull). This yields ash loading as a function of cloud height, HT alone.
Plume height, however, is a complex function of source and environmental conditions, so using plume height alone to
estimate mass loading can dramatically underestimate mass loading in the case of high wind.
2.3. bent Eruption Column Model
To deal with overdependence on plume height, we can use measurements of several more primitive source variables: vent speeds and vent radii, and ground measurements of ash properties. Using these primitive variables as
inputs to suitable models we postulate that we can better sample the uncertain input parameter space for a VATD
model rather than the current practice of using plume height conversion.
We thus track ash dispersal using an eruption column, plume rise model bent with uncertain input parameters
of vent speed and radius, and mean and variance of grain size, coupled with a radiosonde from near the initiation of
the eruption when available to construct a sample space of uncertain input parameters of grain size, mass loading and
injection height. The mass loading and height from the plume rise model are then used as input to a VATD model,
using NCEP Reanalysis windﬁelds to track the propagation of ash.
The bent integral eruption column model will be used to produce eruption column parameters (mass loading,
column height, grain size distribution) given a speciﬁc atmospheric sounding and source conditions [18]. bent takes
into consideration atmospheric (wind) conditions as given by atmospheric sounding data. Thus plume rise height is
given as a function of volcanic source and environmental conditions.
3. DDDAS Workﬂow Characterization
We begin by laying out the overall workﬂow and use it to describe the DDDAS framework for this application.
Figure 1 describes the overall workﬂow of the ash plume prediction DDDAS application. Key to workﬂow are the
propagation of uncertainty – in parameters and source terms (wind ﬁeld) and integration with data from satellites and
other observations. We start with a description of the pdf of the concentration of ash at initial time at all points on some
grid covering the jurisdiction of interest . As time evolves the concentration pdf is propagated by using the uncertainty
described by the wind and input parameters. The wind eﬀect is accounted for by using AGMM (See details below)
in the inner loop in lock-step with the bent-puff coupled model. The outer PCQ loop (see Fig. 1) accounts for
the input parameter uncertainty. The propagated concentration pdf is updated using data assimilation methodology
as described below. After every data assimilation step the input model parameters pdf is updated using the Bayesian
framework. Based on the modiﬁed pdf a new PCQ based sampling must be redone. Note that we can always start the
process at some posterior time if a concentration ﬁeld and its variability are available. Depending on the uncertainty
associated with the posterior pdfs we can use higher ﬁdelity models in the data assimilation loop.
3.1. Uncertainty and Stochastic Variability
There are a number of signiﬁcant challenges associated with uncertainty characterization and propagation for
spatio-temporal varying systems like those encountered in the ash plume transport. Uncertainty arises from several

sources: parameters, initial and boundary conditions, forcing functions, are known only to certain precision. For
example, bent-puff input parameters include coeﬃcient of gravity fallout, vent diameter, vent velocity, mean grain
size and windﬁeld. All of these parameters are known only approximately and only to a ﬁxed ﬁdelity. Despite the
potential risk to property and life from inaccurate prediction of ash clouds, there has never been a thorough quantitative assessment of ash cloud predictions due to parametric and stochastic uncertainties. Most of the literature[19–23]
focuses on tracking the ash material plume while making use of the sensitivity information of plume location to measured material ﬂux or concentration. While a detailed sensitivity analysis can relate the variations in input parameters
to ash cloud, uncertainty analysis casts a much broader net in terms of assessing conﬁdence of predictions based on
all available information. These aforementioned two questions clarify the main outcome of our work here To provide
a prediction of ash cloud motion, together with a quantitative measure of the variability of that prediction, informed by
all available data in real time. [Note: By “real time”, we mean a prediction of cloud motion 12-24 hours in advance,
taking no more than 6 hours from initiation to completion.]
A companion paper [3] will provide the technical details of our approach to uncertainty quantiﬁcation for this
problem. We provide here an overview. To discuss uncertainty and its eﬀects in models, we distinguish between
parametric uncertainty and stochastic forcing. Mathematically, these two kinds of uncertainty are accounted for
diﬀerently. However there is not a perfect demarcation between the way we treat these. For example, we cannot
know the input windﬁeld perfectly - at every point in the atmosphere at every instant of time and we may choose to
model this uncertainty as a stochastic forcing of a given size at each computational location in space-time. Following
arguments in [24] that probability theory is the right setting to describe our lack of information, we adopt here a
probabilistic framework.

Instead of solving for the ash concentration at a given time and location (based on integration of puff particles)
we treat the concentration at a given location and time as a random variable xk . The time evolution of the vector
of xk s, is given by a stochastic diﬀerential equation (which should be thought of as generalization of Eq. (1) to include
the physics of the bent-puff coupling):
xk+1 = f(tk , xk , Θ) + ηk ,

x(t0 ) = x¯ 0

(2)

In this equation, Θ represents uncertain but time-invariant system parameters such as the coeﬃcient of gravity fallout,
vent diameter or vent velocity. The random function ηk represents stochastic forcing terms, such as turbulent diﬀusion,
or any stochastic eﬀect that might be added to the windﬁeld. These random functions may be modeled as a Gaussian
process with speciﬁed correlation function Qk . The nominal initial position of the center of the particles is given
by x¯ 0 , which may also be uncertain. The total uncertainty associated with the state vector xk is characterized by the
probability distribution function (pdf) p(tk , xk , Θ) whose time evolution characterizes our uncertainty. Using the full
pdf has many advantages, especially the ability in a DDDAS framework of integrating data and prediction easily using
Bayesian approaches.
Several approximate techniques are commonly used to approximate the state pdf evolution [25, 26], the most
popular being Monte Carlo (MC) methods [27], Gaussian closure [28], Equivalent Linearization [29], and Stochastic
Averaging [30]. In addition, a Gaussian Process approach to solve nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equations has been
proposed in Ref. [32]. All of these algorithms except MC methods are similar in several respects, and are suitable
only for linear or moderately nonlinear systems, because the eﬀect of higher order terms can lead to signiﬁcant errors.
Monte Carlo methods require extensive computational resources and eﬀort, and become increasingly infeasible for
high-dimensional dynamic systems [33] and the limited and time bound response needed in DDDAS settings.
The next two subsections discuss our planned methods for solving the time evolution of state pdf for systems that
include stochastic forcing terms and parametric uncertainty.
3.2. Parameter Uncertainty Propagation
The bent- puff model is subject to parametric uncertainty. The propagation of uncertainty due to time-invariant
but uncertain input parameters can be approximated by a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), originally due to Xiu
and Karniadakis [34]. Roughly speaking, gPC postulates a separation of random variables from deterministic ones
in the solution algorithm for a diﬀerential equation. The random variables are expanded as a polynomial, those
polynomials being associated with the assumed probability distribution for the input variables (for example, Hermite
polynomials for normally distributed parameters, or Legendre for uniformly distribution). Galerkin collocation is
used to generate a system of coupled, deterministic diﬀerential equations for the expansion coeﬃcients. The gPC
collocation step fails when applied to problems with non-polynomial nonlinearities, and can produce non-physical
solutions when applied to hyperbolic equations. Non-intrusive spectral projection (NISP) or stochastic collocation
methods can overcome these diﬃculties [35–37]. We will use a diﬀerent formulation of the NISP idea [38] that we
call polynomial chaos quadrature (PCQ). PCQ replaces the projection step of NISP with numerical quadrature. The
resulting method can be viewed as a Monte-Carlo-like evaluation of (2), but with sample points selected by quadrature
rules.
The bent- puff model contains both stochastic forcing and parametric uncertainty. We assume the parametric uncertainty is independent of the forcing terms, and propose wrapping the PCQ quadrature evaluation around
an AGMM solution step. For a ﬁxed value of parameter Θ = Θ j , the AGMM provides an output distribution accounting for stochastic forcing. Integration (by PCQ) over the uncertain inputs determines the posterior. Expressed

3.3. Uncertainty Propagation due to Stochastic Forcing
Consider ﬁrst Eq. (2) for ﬁxed system parameters Θ0 , and a stochastic forcing η. In the context of the bent- puff
model, this assumption is akin to ﬁxing all input parameters but allowing for a random component the windﬁeld.
The time evolution of the pdf from time-step k to time-step k + 1 is given by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation
(CKE) [39–41]:
p(tk+1 , xk+1 |Θ0 ) =

p(tk+1 , xk+1 |tk , xk , Θ0 )p(tk , xk |Θ0 )dxk

(4)

Here p(tk+1 , xk+1 |tk , xk , Θ0 ) is the state transition corresponding to the pdf for the process noise ηk [42]. The CKE is
a formidable equation to solve because: (i) the pdf must remain positive, (ii) the pdf must maintain unit volume, and
(iii) the domain of p changes in time.
The integral in Eq. (4) is over the state space xk , so it is high dimensional. Traditional numerical approaches which
discretize the space in which the pdf lies suﬀer from the “curse of dimensionality”. To overcome this obstacle, we
will use a recently developed adaptive Gaussian mixture model (AGMM) in conjunction with information theoretic
measures [43, 44] to accurately solve the CKE. The key idea of the AGMM is to approximate the state pdf by a
ﬁnite sum of Gaussian density functions whose mean and covariance are propagated from one time-step to the next
using linear theory. The weights of the Gaussian kernels are updated at every time-step, by requiring the sum to
satisfy the CKE [45]. When properly formulated, the mixture problem can be solved eﬃciently and accurately using
convex optimization solvers, even if the mixture model includes many terms. This methodology eﬀectively decouples
a large uncertainty propagation problem into many small problems. As a consequence, the solution algorithm can be
parallelized on most high performance computing systems. Sec.4 below brieﬂy descibes preliminary results, where
an ensemble of bent- puff computations were run in parallel. Finally, a Bayesian framework can be used on the
AGMM structure to assimilate (noisy) observational data with model forecasts [46, 47].
3.4. Data Assimilation for Reducing Uncertainty
Of course using any sensor data that might become available to correct and reﬁne the dynamical model forecast
will reduce the uncertainty of predictions. This model-data fusion process is well documented in meteorology applications where a variety of data assimilation methods are used operationally to improve the quality of the Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast[48–51]. Several recent studies additionally used conventional ﬁltering approaches
to incorporate observations of a chemical species into a dispersion model[52, 53] and discuss how the nonlinearities
in T&D models and sparse measurement data cause problems in capturing non-Gaussian state pdf. In general, ﬁnding an optimal ﬁlter is an inﬁnite dimensional problem [54, 55]. Finite dimensional ﬁlters have been derived for a
certain nonlinear problems [56–59]. For more general but low-order nonlinear systems, particle ﬁlter methods hold
promise[60].
Standard Bayesian tools will be employed to incorporate observational data. Given a prediction of the state
variable xk , standard Bayesian algorithms assume a sensor model h to obtain the measurement, yk = h(tk , xk ) + vk .
Here vk is the measurement noise with prescribed likelihood function p(yk |xk ). Using the dynamic state evolution
sketched above as a forecasting tool, the state pdf can be updated using the Bayes’ rule and measurement data:
p(xk |Yk ) =

p(yk |xk )p(xk |Yk−1 )
p(yk |xk )p(xk |Yk−1 )dxk

(5)

Here, p(xk |Yk−1 ) represents the prior pdf (the computed solution of the CKE), p(yk |xk ) is the likelihood that we observe
yk given the state xk and p(xk |Yk ) represents the posterior pdf of xk . For a ﬁxed set of data and underlying probability
model, Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) picks the values of the state estimates that make both the data and model “more
likely” than any other values of the state estimates would make them. This may be of considerable use for decision
support in situations in which multiple strong and roughly equal modes appear in the posterior estimate. Neither the
conditional mean nor the maximum likelihood estimate as the sole reported hypotheses are suﬃcient to formulate
eﬀective decisions in this case [61].

3.5. Model Hierarchy
The use of the modestly complicated puff code and the availability of other models of diﬀering ﬁdelities opens
up the possibility of using multiple models with the higher resolution model acting as an eﬀective alternate provider
for gaps in the sparse data from observations. We will focus these runs on well deﬁned parameter ranges where the
basic puff code’s output is deemed to be poor based on observations. Our preliminary work (see below 4) and recent
literature[62] indicates that the puﬀ code is sensitive to the choice of number of particles. However, the cost of the
computation with very large numbers of particles (107 as opposed to the more common 105 ) is very high. We will
selectively use a few of these high particle runs to provide a high ﬁdelity source where we notice large discrepancy
between the satellite and bent-puff outputs.
3.6. Observation and Testing
We are fortunate to have access to a wealth of data from the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption and the subsequent
cloud dispersion. The daily windﬁelds for the important period between April 14 - 20 are known, satellite images
tracking the cloud are available, as is plume data (for example, there is Meteosat SEVIRI data on ash loading and
plume height, and SEVIRI and CALIPSO data showing the motion of the cloud). This event will provide a rigorous
test of the proposed uncertainty methodology, and in particular the sensitivity of simulation results to diﬀering plume
and windﬁeld inputs.
Webley et al. [63] suggest the possibility of running VATD models using retrieved ash cloud parameters from
satellite remote sensing data. We will assess this potential. We will also generate ‘synthetic’ satellite imagery from
the puff model simulations, using the ash concentrations, optical depths of the clouds and particle sizes to generate
equivalent reverse absorptions signals and opaque cloud temperatures. This process is, essentially, an inverse of the
volcanic ash retrieval process developed by Wen and Rose [64] and Pavolonis et al. [65]. Here, we will use the
VATD concentration maps to determine the eﬀect the ash would have on the temperature of the cloud as seen by the
satellite. From this we can compare datasets and examine the satellite retrieval limits and reverse absorption detection
capabilities. This synthetic imagery from the puff model will then allow statistical comparisons between the diﬀerent
datasets, to ascertain which parameters have the greatest eﬀect on the model simulation uncertainties.
4. Preliminary Results
A ﬁrst step in this research eﬀort is reported in [66], where four bent inputs (vent radius, vent velocity, mean grain
size, and grain size variance) were considered as uncertain, bent outputs fed into an ensemble of puff simulations,
and PCQ was employed as a solution methodology (see additional details in companion paper [? ].
Following runs of bent at Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature points, each bent output is then propagated through puff,
which was then run for a real-time period of ﬁve days. The outputs from puff were then combined to produce the
ensemble by applying the appropriate weight to each deterministic bent–puff run.
Numerical methodology of the type used here must always be tested for consistency, i.e., independence from
discretization parameters or sample size. As we seek to develop an ensembling method that could be implemented
in a ﬁnite computing time, we also need to minimize the number of parcels and runs. For this set of simulations
we compared the simulation outputs for 94 and 134 samples (quadrature points) and the results indicate that 94 runs
yields substantially the same results as 134 runs. The comparison of using 105 , 4 × 106 and 107 particles in the puff
simulation also indicated that the choice of 4 × 106 particles was adequate for our purposes, and consistent with the
ﬁndings of others [62].
5. Conclusions and Future Directions
Model output was compared with Meteosat-9 retrievals of top ash plume height. Volcanic ash was identiﬁed in
the satellite data using the methodology described in [67] and [68]. The ash cloud height were retrieved using an
optimal estimation approach [69] and [70]. All microphysical assumptions used in the retrieval are described in [71].
In general, plume location is quite close to that shown in the data, with little variance. There are greater divergences
between model and data in the eastern portion of the plume where Meteosat-9 data estimate a much smaller plume
area than does the model. Estimating probabilities by computing the coeﬃcients in the polynomial approximation of

the pdf from the PCQ methodology indicates that all observed ash is within the 0.2 probability contours and most is
within the 0.7 contour. It appears from the literature that this is the ﬁrst time such quantitative information has been
available from simulation albeit in hind cast mode. In short, preliminary results shows that PCQ scheme yields a
valid estimate of mean and standard deviation of ash parameters for a relatively small sample size of order [94 ]. The
question arises however, whether even PCQ can provide probabilistic estimates useful in Volcanic Ash Advisories in
a reasonable time. This question clearly needs to be investigated further.
