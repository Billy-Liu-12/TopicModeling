Abstract. This study is based on our earlier work with reactivity index to propose
intra and inter molecular reactivity in catalytic materials using density functional
theory, within the domain of hard soft acid base (HSAB) principle. We have as
well shown small example to show directly the utility of this method in
elucidating acidity in catalytic material of interest. Our goal is to show that a
simple theory can be useful to design new futuristic material of interest.

1 Introduction
The hard soft acid-base (HSAB) principles classify the interaction between acids and
bases in terms of global softness. Pearson proposed the global HSAB principle [1]. The
global hardness was defined as the second derivative of energy with respect to the
number of electrons at constant temperature and external potential, which includes the
nuclear field. The global softness is the inverse of this. Pearson also suggested a
principle of maximum hardness (PMH) [2], which states that, for a constant external
potential, the system with the maximum global hardness is most stable. In recent days,
DFT has gained widespread use in quantum chemistry [3]. This study aims to review
the development and application of reactivity index in key catalytic process within our
research [4-9].
With this background, the influence of both bivalent and trivalent metal substituents
from a range of metal cation (Co, Mn, Mg, Fe and Cr) on the acidic property (both
Bronsted and Lewis) of metal substituted aluminum phosphate MeAlPOs is monitored.
Intramolecular and intermolecular interactions show that once active site of the
interacting species is identified, the influence of the environment can be prescribed.

2 Theory
The electronegativity χ, defined by Mulliken as the average of ionization potential I
and electron affinity A, χ =1/2(I + A), is such a parameter; it is a useful measure of the
tendency of a species to attract electrons. Thus the electronegativity χ has been
identified as the negative of the chemical potentialμ, which is the Lagrange multiplier
in the Euler-Lagrange equation in density functional theory, and
μ = (δE/δN) ν(r) = - χ

Where, E is the total electronic energy, N is the number of electrons, and ν(r) is the
external electrostatic potential an electron at r feels due to the nuclei. Mulliken's
formula - 1/2(I + A) is no more than the finite-difference approximation for Eq. 1.
Similarly, the natural definition of the hardness, called η has been shown to be
η= (δ2E/ δN2) ν(r) = (μδ/δN) ν(r)
(2)
Which, has the finite-difference approximation I - A. The hardness/softness/acid/base
principle has been derived using Eq. 2 as the definition of hardness. On the other hand,
the frontier electron densities proposed by Fukui are local properties that depend on r;
they differentiate one part of a molecule from another and serve as reactivity indices.
In density functional theory, hardness (η) is defined as
η = ½(δ2E/δN2) v(r) = ½ (δμ/dN) v
(3)
Where E is the total energy, N is the number of electrons of the chemical species and
the chemical potential.
The global softness, S, is defined as the inverse of the global hardness, η.
S = 1/2η = (δN/δμ)v

(4)

Using the finite difference approximation, S can be approximated as
S = 1/(IE – EA)

(5)

where IE and EA are the first ionization energy and electron affinity of the molecule,
respectively.
The Fukui function f(r) is defined by
f(r) = [δμ/dv(r)]N = [δρ (r)/δN]v

(6)

The function ‘f’ is thus a local quantity, which has different values at different
points in the species, N is the total number of electrons, μ is the chemical potential
and v is the potential acting on an electron due to all nuclei present.
The local softness s(r) can be defined as
s(r)=(δρ(r)/δμ)v
(8)
Equation (9) can also be written as
s(r) = [δρ(r)/δN]v[δN/δμ]v = f(r)S
(7)
Thus, local softness contains the same information as the Fukui function f(r) plus
additional information about the total molecular softness, which is related to the global
reactivity with respect to a reaction partner, as stated in HSAB principle. Atomic
softness values can easily be calculated by using eq 10, namely:
sx+ = [qx(N+1) – qx(N)]S
(8)
sx = [qx(N) – qx(N-1)]S
sx0 = S[qx(N+1) – qx (N-1)]/2
We further explained the interaction energy scheme as follows. This is known that
A & B interacts in two steps: (1) interaction will take place through the equalization of
chemical potential at constant external potential and (2) A and B approach the
equilibrium state through changes in the electron density of global system generated by
making changes in the external potential at constant chemical potential. That means
within DFT we can write
Δ E inter = E[ρAB] - E [ρA] - E [ρB]
(9)

Where ρAB, ρA, ρB are the electron densities of the systems AB at equilibrium and of
the isolated systems A and B, respectively
Or in terms of the potentials we can write
ΔE inter = ΔEv + ΔEμ

(10)

Where, ΔEv = -1/2[(μA – μB) 2/ (SA + SB)] (SASB)
ΔEμ = -1/2 NAB2 k [1/(SA + SB)

(11)

NAB total no. of electrons, k the proportionality constant between SAB and SA + SB,
product of N2 and K is λ.
ΔEμ = (-1/2) λ / (SA + SB)

(12)

If the interaction is taking place through j site of A,
λAj = q Aj eq – q Aj 0

0

qAj is density of jth atom of A in complex AB & qAj is the density in isolated system.
In our all studies, all calculations with molecular clusters have been carried out with
DFT [11] using DMol3 code of Accelrys. A gradient corrected functional BLYP [12]
and DNP basis set [13] was used through out the calculation. Single point calculations
of the clusters in their cationic and anionic form, at the optimized geometry of the
original neutral clusters were also carried out to evaluate Fukui functions and global
and local softness. The condensed Fukui function and atomic softness were evaluated
using eqs 8 and 11, respectively, using electrostatic potential (ESP) driven charges.

3 Result
We will now site a short example to show how these calculations can be implemented
to design catalytic materials with acidic site activity. Calculations were performed on
AlPO34 framework, which is isostructural with zeolite chabazite. The cluster
calculations were formed on localized cluster generated from the AlPO34 structure
with the terminal Al or P. Two independent clusters of the formula (1) M+2AlP2O12H9
and (2) M+3AlP2O12H8 generated by replacing one P by a M2+ or M3+ to represent the
bivalent and trivalent dopant incorporated clusters respectively as shown in Figure 1.
The proton is included at the bridging oxygen where the dopant is incorporated for
electrical neutrality for bivalent substitution. The terminal Al or P were replaced by
hydrogen at that distance to mimic the real situation. It is observed that for the bivalent
dopants the local environment is a distorted tetrahedral. For all the cases the M-OH
distance is the longest. The M-O distances are considerably longer than the Al-O
distance when the AlPO material is undoped, showing that the dopants introduce a
considerable amount of distortion in the system. There is a drastic change in the
M-O-P and angle values, ~1350 compared to the Al-O-P ~1480, which show that the
observed structural distortion is not local and can be propagated beyond the nearest
neighbor to the undoped region, which is in sharp contrast to the earlier results of
Saadoune et al [14].
To correlate the activity of dopants, hence we performed localized reactivity index
calculation for the bivalent dopants using M+2AlP2O12H9 cluster. The Fukui function
and local softness for the hydroxyl proton is presented both in terms of nucleophilic
and electrophilic activity. Relative electrophilicity (sx+/sx-) and relative nucleophilicity

(sx-/sx+) can be defined as the electrophilicity of any site as compared to its own
nucleophilicity for the first term and vice versa. Table 1. Local softness and relative
nucleophilicity for the bivalent and trivalent dopants calculated in terms of the dopant
using ESP charges by DFT to monitor Lewis acidity trend.
The relative nucleophilicity is highest for Mg2+ and is lowest for Cr2+, which is
opposite to the trend observed in terms of substitution energy. Fukui functions were
used to monitor the dopants activity in terms of Lewis acidity. The results are shown in
Table 2. For bivalent cation this order is totally different form the order obtained in
terms of substitution energy and that obtained from the Bronsted acidity trend. For the
trivalent dopant the highest nucleophilicity lies with Fe3+ and the lowest is for Mn3+; the
results matches with the trend of substitution energy. The trend for Bronsted acidity is
Cr2+ < Mn2+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Mg2+ , where as the trend for Lewis acidity mainly for
trivalent metal dopant is Fe3+ > Co3+ > Cr3+ > Mn3+. This optimistic result encourages us
to monitor a mixed valence situation, which may ideally exist during calcinations for
the cations with variable oxidation state.
