Abstract. Building and maintaining the information superiority is the basis of
the principle of active defense, integrated guarding in the cyberspace. In this
paper, a novel method based on grey verhulst model was introduced to forecast
the network system’s security situation. Starting with unequal interval original
risk data series, the proposed method choosed grey verhulst model or its inverse
function to forecast the future risk value of network system, ant then it could
modify the forecasting precision based on multilevel residual error. Simulation
results reveal that the presented model not only gains the intuitionistic curve
graph of network security situation, but also can achieve satisfactory precision.
At the same time, it is simple in use and deserves further study to fully explore
its potential for evaluation issues.
Keywords: non-equal interval, grey verhulst model, residual error revision,
situation awareness.

1 Introduction
The situation awareness[1,2] is to analyze or comprehend various elements’ behavior
in time and space in active or autonomic way, as well as its evolutive tendency,
attempt and prospective developments situation. It is an indispensably credible
technology for safe precaution system.
Because the influencing factors of network security is complex and uncertain, so it
is difficult to construct an appropriate forecasting model for security situation of
network system. At present the various proposed frames[2,3,4] of cyberspace
situation awareness cannot mostly provide practically useful situation information,
cannot help manager make the right decision-making in the system actual security
condition. According to the theory of grey system pioneered by Professor Deng[5], a
system that lacks adequate information can be considered as a grey system. In this
case, the network system can be view as a grey system. Considering the non-linearity
of the risk data sequence, the grey verhulst model is selected and employed, which
may discover the system’s developmental principles and may scientifically make the
quantitative forecast for future system’s security situation. The verhulst model is

suitable to model for non-monotonous swings sequence or the saturated ‘S’ shape
sequence very much, just as figure 1 demonstrated. This kind of curves can be divided
into three segments as a whole: in I segment, the rate of curve slow increases; in II
segment, the rate of curve is close to the linearity; in III segment, the rate of curve
tends to steady value. Due to the original sequence is generally non-equal interval, so
this paper chooses the non-equal interval grey verhulst model with residual error
revision to carry out the modeling of the network system’s security situation.

This paper proposes a first-time application of mathematics based grey verhulst
model for the forecasting of network system’s security situation. Following contents
are arranged as follows: section 1, 2 introduced the proposed model and its residual
error revision method in detail; section 3 validates the model through simulation
experiments; section 4 was a conclusion, which pointed out the future possible
studies.

2 Modeling Process
2.1 The Processing Method of Non-equal Interval Data Sequence
Referring to the literature‘s processing method[6], we suppose the original sampling
risk data sequence is X (0) = {x (0) (tk ), k = 1,2,..., n} , where ti +1 − ti > 0 . Due to the data
sequence tk is non-equal interval, and the difference dt = tk +1 − tk is not bigger, we may
use the least squares method to construct the equal interval data sequence
t 'k .According to the equation t 'k = m0 + m1 ⋅ k , we can obtain the group of equations

T ' = AM , where AT = ⎜

Then, we can gain T ' using t 'k = m0 + m1k .Finally, we uses Langrange method to
obtain the equal interval data sequence X ( 0) (T ') again.
2.2 The Establishment of Non-equal Interval Verhulst Model
After the processing of equal interval, we can obtain equal interval data sequence, and
then we may use the verhulst model to carry out modeling and forecasting. Let the
original data sequence be X (0) = { x (0) (t ) | t = 1, 2,..., n} then the AGO (accumulated

generation operation) of X (0) is X (1) = {x (1) (t ) | t = 1, 2,..., n} , where x (1) (t ) = ∑ x (0) (i)
t = 1,2,..., n , and let x (1) (1) = x (0) (1)

synthesized as follows:

，the nonlinear differential equation of X

(t ) can be

dt

(2)

where a denotes the development coefficient, whose size and sign reflect the
development situation of X (0) ; b denotes the system’s input and its value presents
some kind of grey information. These coefficients a , b can be identified by the least
squares method as follows:
[a, b]T = [ BT B ]−1 BT Y

Consequently, from Eq. (2), Xˆ (1) (t ) can be observed as

Xˆ (1) (t ) =

Furthermore, from Eq. (4), can acquire the forecasted value as
Xˆ (0) (t ) = Xˆ (1) (t ) − Xˆ (1) (t − 1)

(5)

Thus, the above equation from Eq. (2-5) is the non-equal interval Verhulst model.
2.3 Inverse Function Model of Grey Verhulst Model
The actual risk-time curve of network security situation frequently takes on the shape
of reverse "S", which is similar to the curve of Verhulst model’s inverse function.
This kind of curves can be also divided into three segments as a whole: in I segment,

1080

G. Zhao et al.

the rate of curve linearly increases; in II segment, the rate of curve slow grows; in III
segment, the movements fast goes up, and finally tend to peak value. Therefore, we
may use the inverse function model of non-equal interval grey verhulst model to
analyze the reverse "S" characters of security situation curve.
Through solving Eq. (4) for a reverse function solution of Xˆ (1) (t ) , we obtain the
following inverse function model of grey verhulst:
1 (a − bt0 )t ˆ (0)
Xˆ (1) (t ) = ln
+ X (t )
a at0 − bt0t

(6)

In above equation, t denotes a time: a, b represents the coefficient of expression.
Thus, using the Eq. (5) to regress, we may obtain the forecast value of the original
data sequence.

If the forecasted precision has not been good once, we may also establish the
multilevel residual error revision. The so-called multilevel residual error is the
difference of the forecast value and the original accumulation value after many times
revising. For instance, if the forecasted value revised k times is Xˆ (1) (t , k ) the kth
times residual error is ε (0) (t , k )
where ε (0) (t , k ) = x (1) (t ) − xˆ (1) (t , k ) and xˆ (1) (k ,0) = xˆ (1) (k ) ,

we thus have xˆ (1) (t , k ) = xˆ (1) (t , 0) + ∑ ε (0) (t , i ) .

A model can’t be applied to predict, unless it is tested well. Generally, when we
predict, whether the value of prediction and actual value is consistent or not is more
important than the predicted value itself. Here, we uses the backward error-detection
test method[7] to carry out the measure, furthermore the model’s precision can be
depicted together by backward error-detection ratio C and small error probability P
(see Table 1).

4 Simulations
By taking the attack data collected by network security organize - HoneyNet[8] in
November as test data , we continued the tracing of security situation of network
system in this month following the proposed approach. Using the method[9] to
process the test data first, we can obtain the initial non-equal interval generating series
shown in the following table 2, namely X ( 0) (ti ) = {18.5,5.0,3.7,8.2,16.4,12.0,6.6,12.1} ,
where (i = 1,2,...,8) , T = {0,2,5,10,14,17,19,22} . After being processed, having
⎛ m ⎞ ⎛ −3 ⎞

increase in II section, so we adopted the Verhulst model to directly modeling. Due to
Eq. (2)-Eq. (6),the forecast model can be list as table 3 shown.

can be obtained as

After being checked by the backward error-detection test method, the above
model’s precision is good and the size of each residual error is less. For Xˆ (T ') , it can
be obtained from Eq. [7], and then let Xˆ (T ') and T ' be the raw data, so we can

get X (T ) using the interpolation method. Thus, we obtained the new model with the
residual error revision.
Now, we use the new model with the residual error revision and the model without
the residual error revision to forecast the security situation of network system from
December 1 to December 5 respectively, the sampled data is randomly choosed in
different time span of every day. The curve fitting between the forecasted result and
the actual value can be seen from figure 2.

Fig. 2. The evolutive curve of network system’s security situation

Seen from figure 2(a), the forecasted error is smaller during the initial three days,
but along with days passing, the forecasted error has the tendency of increase and the
forecasted precision gradually drop, which accords with the verhulst model itself
shortcoming. Moreover, the situation curves in figure 2(b) was revised time and
again, which may be obviously seen that the precision greatly enhances, the curve
fitting between the forecasted result and the actual value are really satisfied. The
above-mentioned results indicated that the non-equal interval grey verhulst model
with residual error revision can effectively forecast the relative long-term security
situation of network system.

5 Conclusions
This paper proposed a non-equal interval grey verhulst model with residual error
revision to predict network system security’s development situation for the first time.
The experimental results show the model effectively overcome the discrete traits of
original data, can obtain the reasonable network security development tendency even
if in uncertain or lack information, and has certain practical value. Although the
proposed method has done some work in the realization aspect of network security
situation awareness, there are still many important problems not been considered,
such as the suitable question of massive samples, the selection way of residual error
sequence, as well as model’s time and spatial complexity and so on, which waits for
further research.
