Abstract
Three-charge-particle quantum systems with arbitrary masses are treated by a general formalism based on coordinate space integral-diﬀerential Faddeev-Hahn-type equations. To solve these equations we expand the wave function
components in terms of bound states in initial and ﬁnal channels and project these equations on these bound states as
in the close coupling method used in the Schr¨odinger equation. After a proper angular momentum projection, a set
of coupled integral-diﬀerential equations for the unknown expansion coeﬃcients results, which is solved numerically
by discretization for the calculation of both bound state and rearrangement scattering. In this work, the formalism
is employed to study atomic 3-body systems like negative ion of positronium Ps− =(e+ e− e− ) and H+2 , as well as an

1. Introduction
Quantum-mechanical few-body problems play an important role in modern physics because they are able to adequately describe few-particle systems with Coulomb, nuclear and Coulomb + nuclear forces. In part, the importance
of this technique can be related to the fact that there are numerous applications in atomic/molecular physics, plasma
physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics that still are challenging to theorists. This situation is documented by the
following: [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, solution methods developed in this ﬁeld are often based on detailed few-body
equations which can provide a meaningful description of the quantum few-body dynamics. However, the advantages
this approach provides can be muted by the complexity of the calculations which even on state of the art computers
can still involve a lengthy time to solve. It is therefore important to consider parallelization as well as other high
performance related techniques when attempting to apply this methodology. It is widely accepted that except for a
few select systems that the three body problem cannot be solved in an explicit way.
In order to increase the value of this methodology the development of new stable numerical schemes and eﬀective
computer algorithms are critical. In problems involving quantum three-body systems the Faddeev equations [5] are

one of the most rigorous attempts to increase the eﬀectiveness of these numerical calculations. While the Faddeev
technique is widely used in nuclear physics its application in three-body Coulomb systems is under utilized. This may
be in part because some regard them as too complex to solve when applied to atomic scattering problems [6]. However, there have been some sucesses in the application of using few-body quantum-mechanical descriptions of charge
transfer reactions within modiﬁed Faddeev equations. Speciﬁcally, Faddeev-Hahn (FH) equations have been sucessfully devised and tested by the primary author of this work [7]. This prior work featured a close-coupling methodology
which led to the expansion of the system’s wave function components into eigenfunctions of the subsystem’s (target)
Hamiltonians which provided a set of one-dimensional integral-diﬀerential equations after a partial-wave projection
was applied. It was therefore demonstrated that the FH-equation approach can be an eﬀective tool in the description
of Coulomb three-body systems.
In this paper, the method will be applied to other few-body problems and the appropriate numerical and computing
details of these calculations will be presented. Our goal is to demonstrate that the numerical scheme we propose
will allow us to carry out fairly accurate calculations for various atomic three-body systems across diﬀerent energy
levels. Further, this will be done in the framework of a uniﬁed computer program that could be easily modiﬁed to
ﬁt into a high performance computing environment. Speciﬁcally in this paper we will delineate our calculations for
the following systems: 1) ground-state energies of a negative ion of positronium Ps− = (e− e+ e− ), where e− /e+ are
an/a electron/positron respectively, additionally a positive ion of hydrogen molecule H+2 , and a 3-body rearrangement
process: 2) anti-hydrogen production reaction: p¯ + (e− e+ ) → ( pe
¯ + ) + e− , where p¯ is antiproton. It is hoped that the
results obtained herein will contribute to the state of knowledge in both of these areas.
The next section, to be exact subsection 2.1, will represent symbolic notations for a general three-body system and
introduce the integral-diﬀerential equations suitable for eﬀective numerical computation. Then, subsection 2.2 will
include the details of the numerical method and the resulting implemented algorithm. The third section will contain
a tabular representation of our computational results, and ﬁnally, the fourth section includes brief concluding remarks
and outlook. To aid the reader in understanding of our notations we use atomic units e = = me = 1.
2. Method
2.1. Few-body quantum dynamics, Faddeev decomposition and coupled equations
Consider a Coulomb three-body system with positive charges 1, and 2 and a negative 3. Let rξ be a coordinate,
and mξ be a mass of the ξ-th particle (ξ = 1, 2, 3). Taking the system of units to be e = = m3 = 1, let us introduce
Jacobi coordinates
r3 + m j r j
r j3 = r3 − r j ,
ρk =
− rk ,
j k = 1, 2 .
(1)
1 + mj
In this work we consider only Coulomb interactions between the three particles. For any three Coulomb particles
there are at most only two bound subsystems. This suggests a Faddeev formulation which uses only two components.
A general procedure to derive such formulations was given by Hahn and Watson [8]. In this approach the three-body
wave function is represented as follows
Ψ = Ψ1 (r23 , ρ1 ) + Ψ2 (r13 , ρ2 ),

(2)

where each Faddeev-type component is determined by its own Jacobi coordinates. Ψ1 (r23 , ρ1 ) is quadratically integrable over the variable r23 , and Ψ2 (r13 , ρ2 ) over the variable r13 . To deﬁne Ψl (l = 1, 2) a set of two coupled
Faddeev-Hahn-type equations can be written
(E − H0 − V23 (r23 ))Ψ1 (r23 , ρ1 )

=

(V23 (r23 ) + V12 (r12 ))Ψ2 (r13 , ρ2 ),

(3)

(E − H0 − V13 (r13 ))Ψ2 (r13 , ρ2 )

=

(V13 (r13 ) + V12 (r12 ))Ψ1 (r23 , ρ1 ).

(4)

Here H0 is the kinetic energy operator of the three-particle system, Vi j (ri j ) are paired Coulomb interaction potentials
(i j = 1, 2, 3) and E is the total energy.
The constructed equations satisfy the Schr˝odinger equation exactly. For the energies below the three-body breakup threshold they have the same advantages as the Faddeev equations, because they are formulated for the wave

function components with correct physical asymptotes. The Faddeev decomposition avoids overcompleteness problems because two-body subsystems are treated in an equivalent way, and the correct asymptotics are guaranteed. This
approach simpliﬁes the solution procedure and provides the correct asymptotic behavior of the solution below the
3-body breakup threshold.
In the general case a component of the three-body wave function has the asymptotic form which includes all open
channels: elastic/inelastic, transfer and breakup [9]. In this work we shall use an approximation [10], where each
component of the total wave function corresponds just to one deﬁnite channel: for the elastic/inelastic channel

it is easy to see that the asymptotic behaviour of the total wave function becomes similar to Merkuriev’s asymptotic
[9]. Such an approximation allows us to simplify the solution procedure [11, 12] and simultaneously provide a correct
asymptotic behaviour of the solution before the 3-body breakup threshold.

the wave function components in terms of bound states in initial and ﬁnal channels, and project this equation on these
bound states. The same approach has been used in the framework of the cluster reduction method in nuclear physics.

To ﬁnd a unique solution to (10)−(11), appropriate boundary conditions, depending upon the speciﬁc situation,
need to be considered. First we impose

(13)

(1)

where δ0 is the scattering phase shift and the cross-section is

3) Finally, for the three-body charge-transfer problems we apply the well known K-matrix formalism [13]. This
method has already been applied for solution of three-body problems in the framework of the coordinate space
Faddeev-Merkuriev equations [6]. For the present scattering problem with 1+(23) as the initial state, in the asymptotic
region, it takes two solutions to (10)−(11) satisfy the following boundary conditions

2.2. Numerical algorithm
For numerical solution of the set of coupled intergro-diﬀerential equations (10)-(11) we apply the discretization
method [14]. On the right side of the equations the integrals over ρ1 and ρ2 are replaced by sums using the trapezoidal
rule and the second order partial derivatives on the left side are discretized using a three-point rule [15]. By this means
we get a set of linear equations for the unknown coeﬃcients fα(i) (k) (k = 1, N p ):

Here, coeﬃcients w j are weights of the integration points ρ1i and ρ2i (i = 1, N p ), N s is the number of quantum states
which are taken into account in the expansion (9). This is a well known close-coupling approximation method in
atomic physics [13]. In this work we use up to ten states, that is ﬁve atomic states 1s-2s-2p-3s-3p in each centrum.
D2i j is the three-point numerical approximation of the second oder diﬀerential operator:

and in symbolic-operator notations the set of linear equations (21) has the following form

The discretized equations are subsequently solved by the Gauss elimination method [16]. As can be seen from Eqs.
(20-21) the matrix A has a block structure. There are four main blocks in the matrix: two of them related to diﬀerential
operators and other two to integral operators. Each of these blocks has subblocks depending on the quantum numbers
α = nlλ and α = n l λ . The second order diﬀerential operators produce three-diagonal sub-matrices. In Fig. 1 the
structure of the matrix A is presented. There is no need to keep the whole matrix A in the computer’s RAM. The
following optimization strategy shows that one can reduce memory usage at least four times. Actually, the numerical
equations (20)-(21) can be written in the following way

To solve the integral-diﬀerential equation, one has to calculate the angular integrals in Eq. (10)-(11) which are
independent of the energy E. One needs to calculate them only once and store them on hard disk for the later
calculation of other observables, for instance, the cross sections at diﬀerent energies. Subintegrals in Eqs. (10)-(11)

Note that the expression (30) diﬀers from zero only in a narrow strip when ρi ≈ ρi , because for the considered
three-body systems the coeﬃcient βi is approximately equal to one. This fact is demonstarted in Fig. 2 and 3, where
(12)
(21)
(ρ1 , ρ2 ) and S 2s
we present as examples selected angle integral surfaces (30): S 2s:2p
:2s (ρ2 , ρ1 ) for a muonic-atomic
μ+ e− p+ 3-body system (as an example). All angle integral surfaces have pretty diﬀerent forms. In order to obtain a
converged solution we needed a large number of discretization points (up to 1000) adequately distributed between 0
and 40-60 atomic units. More points are taken near the origin where the interaction potentials are large; a smaller
(ii )
number of points are needed at large distances. It is easy to estimate the total amount NQ of angle integrals S αα
(ρi , ρi )
which are needed to ﬁll out the matrix A, Fig. 1. For example, in the case of N p = 1000 discretization points and
ten-state approximation N s = 2 × 5: NQ = 5 × N s × N p × N p ∼ 108 . However in view of the fact that the value of
(ii )
(ρi , ρi ) is mostly concentrated in the narrow strip, when ρi ≈ ρi one can reduce NQ by factor ∼ 10−4 . We shall
S αα
discuss the results and details of calculations in next section.

In this work we deal with various Coulomb three-body systems at diﬀerent energies. For a speciﬁc physical
situation described by the set of second order integral-diﬀerential equations (10)-(11) one has to impose speciﬁc
boundary conditions to the equations. For example, to calculate bound states of a Coulomb three-body system we have
to impose two boundary conditions (12) and (13). Taking into account the structure of the second order diﬀerential
operator D2i j (22) these conditions can be easily incorporated into the matrix A. For example, from Fig. 1 one can see
that for the ﬁrst line of the matrix i = 1 and for line with i = N p
f (0) = 0

and

f (N p + 1) = 0,

(31)

these values verify that the conditions (12) and (13) are satisﬁed automatically. To calculate binding energies Eb (ξ)
(ξ = 1, 2, ...) of a three-body system we get bα (i) = 0. The linear set (24) has a solution when the determinant of the
matrix A is equal to zero, that is
(32)
det[Ai j (Eb (ξ))] = 0,

Renat A. Sultanov and Dennis Guster / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 624 – 633

631

where Eb (ξ) are unknown parameters. In the case of scattering (14) and rearrangement scattering (16)-(17) problems
we apply almost the same procedure and also have to use Eq. (18). The computer code is constructed in such a
way so that it can be applied to various three-body atomic problems without major changes. For diﬀerent quantum
systems we need only to correctly input atomic or muonic units, masses of particles, their charges and appropriate
boundary conditions. Our computer code consists of three main parts: 1) Initialization of data and numerical grid; 2)
Calculation of the angular integrals S αα (ρ1 , ρ2 ) (30) and saving them on the computer’s hard disk; 3) Construction
of the main matrix A using the S αα (ρ1i , ρ2 j ), solution of the set of linear equations, production of the 3-body wave
function and, ﬁnally, the calculation of physical observables, for the given example’s cross sections. All these tasks
are implemented into the unique computer code.

3. Results
1. In this work we apply the Faddeev-Hahn integral-diﬀerential equation approach and the numerical algorithm
and computation procedure described in Sec. 3 to quantum three-body systems with pure Coulomb interactions and
arbitrary masses. At ﬁrst we calculate ground-state energies of some atomic systems. In Table I we present our
results within the six-state 2×(1s-2s-2p) and the ten-state 2×(1s-2s-2p-3s-3p) approximations to the close-couplingexpansion (9) together with the results of recent variational calculations, which are considered to be the most accurate
to date. We carried out calculations for a negative ion of positronium Ps− and a positive ion of a hydrogen molecule
H+2 . It has been demonstrated herein for Ps− and H+2 systems that the Faddeev-Hahn method is able to produce results
within ∼11% in the six-state model and ∼3.5% in the ten-state model calculations. Convergent numbers are obtained
in these cases with up to 900 points of integration which we distributed between 0 and 40a0 , where a0 is the radius of
the hydrogen atom. More points are taken near the origin where the interaction potantials are large. A small number
of points are needed at large distances. For example, near the origin we took up to 40 equaly spaced points per unit

length interval a0 , in the intermadiate region (ρ = 10 − 20a0 ) we took up to 15 equally spaced points per unit length
interval a0 . Here we would like to point out, that the two considered problems above, namely Ps− and H+2 , represent
useful examples of 3-body Coulomb systems for testing and comparison of diﬀerent methods. For these systems we
have also calculated their wave functions. The advantage of our method is that it is general in nature and is applicable
to a variety of systems. To achieve this ﬂexibility we sacriﬁce a degree of precision. We can calculate beyond 3-4
digits, but in doing so do not get stable results. Our current level of stability provides results that are within ∼1.5-3.5%
of the known quantities generated by their respective speciﬁc algorithm.
2. In this work we carry out analysis of a 3-body charge transfer reaction as well, namely e+ transfer, from a
¯
positronium atom (e+ e− ) to an antiproton p:
p¯ + (e− e+ ) → ( pe
¯ + ) + e− ,

For the collision energies 0.1 eV; 0.5 eV; 1.0 eV; and 2.0 eV we obtain the following cross sections for the 3-chargeparticle reaction mentioned above: 1.5 πa20 ; 2.0 πa20 ; 3.2 πa20 ; 1.7 πa20 respectively. These results are in a reasonable
agreement with previous works [19, 20]. Additionally, the following low energy 3-charge particle collisions

4. Conclusion and outlook
The study of three-body Coulomb problems has been the subject of this work. We have investigated various
atomic three-body systems in the framework of a few-body approach. It was shown that the method of using the
Faddeev-Hahn equations (3)-(4) and close-coupling approximation is eﬀective and able to produce with 10- or even
only 6-states in the close-coupling expansion results that are accurate within ∼11% in the 1s-2s-2p model and ∼3.5%
in the 1s-2s-2p-3s-3p model respectively. This is not just for binding energies of atomic three-body systems (Table
1), but also a charge transfer reaction as well. An eﬀective numerical algorithm has been developed. The method
helps to considerably conserve computer resources, i.e. the whole procedure leads to a signiﬁcant reduction of the
technical and numerical diﬃculties and would be, of course, worth using in future few-particle or few-atomic/molecule
applications. Additionally, it is planed to further improve the eﬃciency of this computer code by using variety of
parallel and/or computer memory distributed processing techniques.
It seems reasonable to suppose that the FH method, the numerical procedure developed in this work and its
computer algorithm would be an eﬀective tool for accurate description of other atomic and molecular few-body
systems such as various three-atomic chemical reactions [22]. One of the advantages of the Faddeev-type method
(3)-(4) is that these equations are formulated for the wave function components with correct physical asymptotes, and,
moreover, the method avoids overcompleteness problems, because of the Faddeev decomposition (2). This is very
important.

Three- and four-atomic-molecular problems and systems have recently been identiﬁed in the physics of the BoseEinstein Condensate (BEC), particularly in the ultra-cold fermionic polar molecular gas [23, 24]. The topic is very
new and popular now in the ﬁeld of atomic, molecular and optical physics, see for example, [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].
Here we also would like to assume that determining the eﬀect of a three-body recombination in BEC between various
components such as electron-ion, ion-ion, atom-atom, molecule-molecule and, for instance, the stark-mixing eﬀect
in ultraslow collisions of a Rydberg atom with massive particles of a positive charge Z + would be an excellent future
problem for the equations (3)-(4).
In the astrophysics of the interstellar medium there is a signiﬁcant need of diﬀerent data of various atom-atom,
atom-molecular and molecular-molecular rotational-vibrational energy transfer non-reactive and reactive cross sections and corresponding thermal rate coeﬃcients. This can also be an interesting ﬁeld to apply few-body methods
[32]. Finally, in the ﬁeld of the exotic atoms [33] and, for example, determining an anti-hydrogen annihilation reaction rate might be another example of a Coulomb few-body problem that may be applicable.
