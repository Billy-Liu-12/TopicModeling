Abstract. Surfaces subdivision is an important means for geometric computing
of surfaces in CAD. This paper proposes a new quadric subdivision for canal
surfaces in this paper, RQ-sphere decomposition, that subdivides canal surfaces
as a set of truncated revolute quadric with joint spheres. Experimental results
show that the RQ-sphere decomposition is better than existing methods.

1 Introduction
Canal surfaces are very useful for representing long thin objects, for instance, poles,
3D fonts, brass instrument or internal organs of the body in solid modeling and
CG/CAD/CAM. It includes natural quadrics (cylinder, cone and sphere), revolute
quadrics, tori, pipes and Dupin cyclide. Therefore, some algorithms of geometric
computing around canal surfaces have been developed recently [2], [3], [6], [8], [9],
[10], [11], [12] and [13], in which, the decomposition schemes of canal surfaces play
an important role. Although quadrilateral/triangular subdivision is a general scheme to
subdivide a general surface into a quadrilateral/triangular mesh, however, it is too
general so that it becomes inefficient when applied to canal surfaces directly. Canal
surfaces possess some good geometric properties and should have more efficient
decomposition scheme than triangulation. This paper presents new revolute quadric
decomposition scheme for canal surfaces.
Besides quadrilateral or triangular decomposition, the three decomposition
schemes have been given specially for canal surfaces: (1) circle decomposition, (2)
cone-sphere decomposition and (3) cyclide decomposition. Circle decomposition
subdivides a canal surface as a densely set of characteristic circles along its spine
curve. It reduces some geometric computations of canal surfaces to the
corresponding ones on circles. Several geometric problems of canal surfaces have
been given in [5], [6], [8] and [10] based on circle decomposition. Cone-sphere [11]
samples a set of spheres along its spine curve and joint each two adjacent sampling
spheres with a common tangential truncated cone, thus, a canal surface can be
approximated with a set of alternating truncated cones and spherical strips. However,
it has two drawbacks: (1) at the high precision, a very dense set of cone-sphere pairs

are required, and (2) when the shape of canal surface bends at a big curvature or
torture, two neighboring truncated cones may intersect each other, see Fig 3(a), that
is called self-intersection. Cyclide decomposition [13] subdivides a canal surface as a
group of bounded Dupin cyclide pairs. This is a natural decomposition scheme for
canal surfaces. However, cyclide is a degree-four surface, its related geometric
computing have no closed form solutions, thus, it does not reduce geometric
computing complexity of canal surfaces.
Quadrics are the lowest order curved surfaces. They have good parametric and
implicit forms. Some related geometric computations are relatively easy and simple.
Therefore, how to construct a piecewise quadric net of a surface becomes important in
CAGD and some methods have been proposed on constructing a piecewise quadric
spline to approximate an arbitrary surface, see [1], [4], [14] and [15]. However, while
suitable for general surfaces, the aforementioned schemes become inefficient or too
complicated when they are directly applied to special surfaces. It is natural to explore
the specific quadric decomposition schemes for canal surface. It has some useful
geometric properties that can just be exploited to develop more efficient quadric
decomposition schemes.
In this paper, we propose a revolute quadric-spherical stripes decomposition for a
regular canal surfaces, which can avoid the two problems of the cone-sphere scheme
above. The main idea is (1) to sample a set of spheres along the spine curve
appropriately and (2) construct a common tangential revolute quadric between each
pair of adjacent sampling spheres, instead of the common tangential truncated cone,
to approximate the canal surface. We note that the revolute quadric-spherical sphere
(hereafter RQ-sphere) scheme is a natural extension of cone-sphere decomposition
scheme.

2 Preliminary
We assume that a canal surface with a regular spine curve C(t) and a rational radius
function R(t) is valid, ||C’(t)|| ≠ 0, and ||C’(t)||2 - R(t) 2 > 0. Ck(t) (see Fig. 1) and Rk(t)
are the center point and the radius of its characteristic circle. Then its equation K(t,θ)
can be given as the following Frenet form (T(t), N(t), B(t)) of C(t), see [8] and [9].

3 RQ-Sphere Decomposition of Canal Surfaces
In this section, we address three problems: (a) how to construct a simple RQ-sphere
fitting a canal surface for two given sampling spheres on the spine curve, (b) how to
avoid self-intersection of two neighboring RQs, and (c) how to optimize local fitting
between a RQ-Sphere and the canal surface.
3.1 Construction of Local RQ-Sphere Fitting
We construct a local coordinate system with the centers of two sampling spheres S1
and S2 at (0, 0, 0) and (c, 0, 0) respectively as shown in (a) of Fig. 2, and the revolute
axis of the common tangential revolute quadric of S1 and S2 as x-axis. Then
Sphere S1 :
Sphere S2 :

x2 + y2 = r2,
(x-c)2 + y2 = r2,

Revolute quadric RQ:

Ax2 + y2 + Dx + F = 0.

(2)
(3)
(4)

By substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (4), we get a quadratic equation (A-1)x + Dx +
(F+r2) = 0, since the RQ is tangential to S1, its determinant must be zero:

∆1 = D2 − 4( A −1)(F + r 2 ) = 0 .

(5)

Similarly by substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (4), we get equation (A-1)x2 + (D+2c)x +
(F + R2 - c2) = 0, its determinant also should be zero, since RQ is tangential to S2:

∆ 2 = ( D + 2c) 2 − 4( A − 1)( F + R 2 − c 2 ) = 0 .

(6)

From Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), we can obtain the other two coefficients D and F as
functions of A:
D2
A( R 2 − r 2 − c 2 ) + (r 2 − R 2 )
,
F=
D=
− r2 .
(7)
4( A − 1)
c

As shown in Fig. 2, there are totally four cases of the shape of RQ: common
tangential hyperboloid, ellipsoid, paraboloid and truncated cone, depending on the
value of the coefficient A. Let us analyze the impact of A on the shape of common
tangential revolute quadric.

fitting, c. Hyperboloid-sphere fitting, d. Ellipsoid-cone fitting

Practically, we require that Tx1 ≤ Tx2; thus implies A < 1, since c > 0. Furthermore,
we can classify the scope of A as follows:
1. If 0 < A < 1, G > 0, the corresponding RQ of Eq. (4) is an ellipsoid;
2. If G = 0, Eq. (4) represents a truncated cone. So cone-sphere is a special case of
RQ-sphere decomposition;
3. If A < 0 and G > 0, Eq. (4) represents a hyperboloid of one leaf.
4. If A < 0 and G < 0, Eq. (4) represents a hyperboloid of two leaves.

3.2 Overlapping Avoidance of Two Adjacent RQs
When the curvature of the spine curve changes acutely in cone-sphere fitting, two
adjacent fitting truncated cones TC1 and TC2 for three specified sampling spheres may
intersect each other as shown in Fig. 3, it is noted as self-intersection. However, two
fitting revolute quadrics can avoid such self-intersections by adjusting the coefficient
A of two fitting RQs appropriately. That introduces two questions: (1) how to judge
such self-intersection of two fitting RQs; and (2) how to the best A for optimal RQsphere fitting to canal surface. To the first question, we give a theorem, the necessary
and sufficient condition for self-intersection determination. To the second question,
we will address it in the nest subsection.

Algebraically, determining intersections of two RQs requires solution of quartic
equation in general. Here, we give a geometric method to solve it. The overlapping of
two RQs and their coherent sphere O in 3D are equivalent to the corresponding
problems of the chords A0B0 and A1B1 (A2B2 or A2B2, as shown in (a), (b) and (c) of
Fig. 4 respectively) in 2D. That concludes the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Two adjacent revolute quadrics RQ1 and RQ2 have the common joint
sphere, they overlap each other if and only if two corresponding chords A0B0 and A1B1
intersect each other, furthermore, if and only if ||OT0’|| > ||OT1|| holds.
It is much simpler than algebraic method. The proof is trivial and omitted here due
to limited space.
3.3 Locally Optimal RQ-Sphere Fitting
By sampling a canal surface x = x(u,v), y = y(u,v) and z = z(u,v) with (ui = u0, u1,
……, um and vi = v0, v1, ……, vn, the least square fitting method is employed to
determine the best value for A in the sense of minimizing the overall sum of square
distances of the sampling points (xij, yij, zij) to the fitting RQ-sphere pairs, which can
be represented as:
min f ( A, D , F ) = ∑ ( Ax ij2 + y ij2 + z ij2 + Dx ij + F ) 2

By differentiating (27) with regards to A, we get

min f A′ ( A, D , F ) = 2 ∑ ( Ax ij2 + y ij2 + z ij2 + Dx ij + F )( x ij2 + D ′A xij + F A′ )

(12)

4 Illustrative Examples
We implemented both cone-sphere and RQ-sphere decomposition of canal surfaces
for comparison. Three examples are illustrated in Fig. 5, the spine curve and radius of
them are represented by cubic Bezier curve in Examp2 and Examp3. The performance
data in Table 1 shows that, for the same canal surface, the ratio of the required RQsphere pairs vs. cone-sphere pairs nearly approaches 1 : 2. We also found that when
the tolerance becomes very tiny value or the curvature of the spine curve big enough,
cone-sphere results in local self-intersection unavoidably. However, RQ-sphere can
avoid such local self-intersection very well.

5 Conclusions
Compared to the cone-sphere scheme, (1) RQ-Sphere can fit canal surfaces more
flexibly to avoid self-intersection and yield visually smother rendering; (2) it has one
degree-of-freedom to allow optimal approximation of canal surfaces, and (3) it only
requires fewer fitting components at the same approximation quality. The revolute
quadric decomposition for surfaces of revolution by authors previously in [7] is a
special case of RQ-sphere decomposition for canal surfaces. The following works can
be extended along this paper:
1. Reconstruction of boundary canal surfaces from skeleton curves by using MAT
technique becomes important. The reconstruction process in [2] and [3] (for one
branch of the MAT) is exactly the definition of canal surface, (the medial axis is
the spine curve C(t), the resulting canal surface is the boundary of reconstructed
volume) Practically, the medial axis is given by a sequence of discrete sampling

points. In fact, the process of Gelston and Dutta’s reconstruction is cone-sphere
fitting. Thus, our RQ-sphere can be extended to such reconstruction directly.
2. RQ-sphere decomposition can reduce the intersection computing problems of
canal surfaces (ray/canal, plane/canal and canal/canal) to the corresponding
problems of RQs. Also, other geometric computing problems of canal, i.e.
isophote, silhouette, and so on, can be revisited in the new perspective of RQsphere decomposition.
Although RQ-sphere decomposition is better than cone-sphere decomposition, it
still requires rather huge number of RQ-sphere pairs to approximate canal surfaces at
the high precision, so more efficient quadric decomposition for canal surfaces and
even other surfaces is our existent goal in the long run.
