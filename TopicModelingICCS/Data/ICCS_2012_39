Abstract
Data assimilation obtains improved estimates of the state of a physical system by combining imperfect
model results with sparse and noisy observations of reality. Not all observations used in data assimilation are equally valuable. The ability to characterize the usefulness of different observation locations is
important for analyzing the effectiveness of the assimilation system, for data pruning, and for the design
of future sensor systems. This paper proposes a new approach to characterizes the usefulness of different observation in four dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation. Metrics from information
theory are used to quantify the contribution of observations to decreasing uncertainty with which the
system state is known. We derive ensemble based, computationally feasible procedures to estimate the
information content of various observations.
Keywords: Four dimensional variational data assimilation, information theory

1. Introduction
In this paper we employ metrics from information theory to quantify the contribution of observations
in improving the state estimate obtained through data assimilation. The information content of observations is loosely deﬁned by their contribution to decreasing the uncertainty in the state estimate [14].
Several of the information theoretic metrics employed here measure the decrease in the (co-)variance of
the error, while others measure the beneﬁt of data assimilation in terms of adjusting the mean of the
distribution. Information theory has been used in atmospheric sciences for quantifying the lack of information in climate systems [1, 19], for developing remote-sounding instruments [21, 22, 23, 20, 30], for data
selection [20], and for quantifying the information content of observations [15, 2, 31, 32].

In this paper we discuss a characterization of the information content of observations in the context of
four dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation framework [4, 13, 3]. The computational procedure proposed here uses the posterior statistics of the variational cost function and its gradient to quantify
the information content of observations.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the variational approach to data assimilation
from a Bayesian perspective. Various metrics for information content are discussed in Section 3. Section
4 develops computationally feasible estimation techniques for the information content of observations in
the context of 4D-Var data assimilation; this is the main contribution of this work. The numerical results
are presented and discussed in Section 5. Section 6 summarizes the ﬁndings of this work and points to
future research directions.
2. Four Dimensional Variational Data Assimilation
Data assimilation estimates the true state of a physical system by combining three different sources
of information: the prior, the model, and observations. Variational methods solve the data assimilation
problem in an optimal control framework [12, 17, 18]. Speciﬁcally, one ﬁnds the control variable values
(e.g., initial conditions) which minimize the discrepancy between model forecast and observations; the
minimization is subject to the governing dynamic equations, which are imposed as strong constraints.
The prior, or the background state, xB ∈ n represents the current best estimate of the true state.
The background estimation errors are usually assumed to have a normal distribution εB = xB − xtrue ∈
N (0, B), where B ∈ n×n is the background error covariance matrix.
The model encapsulates our knowledge about physical laws that govern the evolution of the system.
The model evolves an initial state x0 ∈ n at the initial time t0 to future state values xi ∈ n at future
times ti ,
x i = M t0 → t i ( x 0 ) .
(1)
Observations represent snapshots of reality available at several discrete time moments. Speciﬁcally,
measurements yi ∈ m of the true state are taken at times ti , i = 1, · · · , N
yi = H (xi ) − εobs
i .

(2)

The observation error term εobs
accounts for both the measurement (instrument) errors as well as reprei
sentativeness errors (i.e., errors in the accuracy with which the model can reproduce reality). Typically
observation errors are assumed to be normally distributed εobs
∈ N (0, Ri ), and observation errors at
i
different times are assumed to be independent.
Based on these three sources of information data assimilation computes the analysis (posterior) estimate
A
x , i.e., the best estimate when the new observations are taken into account.
In strongly-constrained 4D-Var data assimilation all observations (2) at all times t1 , · · · , t N are simultaneously considered. The 4D-Var cost function measures the distance of the initial conditions to the
background initial state xB0 , as well as the discrepancy between model predictions H(xi ) and data yi for
all measurement times

All terms are weighted by the inverses of the corresponding error covariances. The 4D-Var analysis is
computed as the initial condition which minimizes (3) subject to the model equation constraints (1)
xA
0 = arg min J ( x0 )

subject to(1).

(4)

The optimization problem (4) can be regarded as least squares ﬁt problem in the deterministic setting. In
the Bayesian interpretation when all densities are Gaussian, the cost function (3) is proportional to the
negative logarithm of the analysis probability density

J (x0 ) ∝ − log P A (x0 ) ,

(5)

and (4) represents a maximum likelihood estimation problem.
The numerical optimization (4) is usually solved via a gradient-based technique. The gradient of (3)
reads
N
∂xi T T −1
∇J (x0 ) = B0−1 x0 − xB0 + ∑
Hi Ri (H(xi ) − yi )
(6)
∂x0
i =1
The 4D-Var gradient requires not only the linearized observation operator Hi = H (xi ), but also the
transposed derivative of future states with respect to the initial conditions. The 4D-Var gradient can be
obtained effectively by forcing the adjoint (M )∗ of the linearized model (1) with observation increments,
and running it backwards in time; the adjoint variables λ at time t0 are related to the gradient via

∇J (x0 ) = B0−1 x0 − xB0 + λ0 (x0 ) .
3. Information Theoretic Metrics of Observation Impact
The 4D-Var data assimilation changes the distribution of errors (uncertainty) in the initial conditions
from the background probability density P B (x) to the analysis probability density P A (x). If the data
assimilation is beneﬁcial, the uncertainty associated with the new distribution P A is smaller than the
uncertainty associated with the original distribution P B .
Roughly speaking, the information content of the observations y is measured by the decrease in uncertainty from before data assimilation (P B ) to after data assimilation (P A ). The information content
depends not only on the data (yi ) but also on the data accuracy (Ri−1 ), on the background uncertainty
(B0−1 ), and on the model dynamics M.
We are interested to rigorously quantify the information content of observations in 4D-Var. For this
we use several information theoretic metrics, which are reviewed below.
3.1. Fisher information matrix
The Fisher information matrix (FIM) [14] associated with the probability density function P (x) is
deﬁned as
∂ (− ln P (x)) T ∂ (− ln P (x))
F (P ) =
) P (x) dx ∈ n×n .
(7)
n
∂x
∂x
The trace of the FIM offers a measure of the total level of uncertainty associated with the distribution.
Under the assumption that the background errors are normally distributed, the Fisher information matrix of the background error probability density P B (x) = N (xB0 , B0 ) is just the inverse of the background
error covariance: F P B = B0−1 .

1050

K. Singh et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1047 – 1055

Using (7) and (5), the FIM associated with the analysis probability density is

F PA

=

n

[∇ J (x0 )] [∇ J (x0 )] T P A (x0 ) dx0 .

(8)

The information content of the entire set of observations used in data assimilation can be measured as the
difference between the traces of the background and analysis FIM [23, 22]:

I FIM = trace F P B

− trace F P A

,

(9)

with
trace F P A

=

n

∇ J ( x0 )

2

P A (x0 ) dx0 = EA

2

∇ J ( x0 )

.

(10)

The trace of the analysis FIM is the average value of the adjoint variable norm with respect to the analysis distribution. The statistical average can be approximated by an ensemble average. After the data
assimilation has been performed, we run the forward and the adjoint models Nens times starting with
forward initial conditions sampled from the analysis probability density. Each run produces an adjoint
gradient, whose norm is computed. The ensemble average of these gradient norms estimates the trace of
the analysis FIM via (10).
3.2. Shannon information
The Shannon entropy [27] associated with a probability density is deﬁned as

H (P ) =

n

P (x) ln (P (x)) dx

and offers a measure of the average uncertainty with which one knows the state x, if the estimation error
has a probability density P . The Shannon information content of observations y used in 4D-Var data
assimilation is deﬁned as the decrease in the average uncertainty with which the initial state is known.
Speciﬁcally, the Shannon information content is given by the difference between the background entropy
and the analysis entropy,

I Shannon = H P B − H P A =

1
ln det A0−1/2 B0 A0−1/2
2

,

(11)

where the last equality holds when both the background and the analysis error probability densities are
Gaussian. This term depends only on the reduction in covariance, and corresponds to the scaling factors
of the Gaussian probability densities (i.e., the factors in front of the exponential). This information is
ignored by the 4D-Var cost function, which uses only the exponent of the Gaussian density. Therefore,
one cannot expect to obtain accurate estimates of the Shannon information content by mining the cost
function information.
Assuming that we have the ability to sample both the background and the analysis probability densities. Both B0 and A0 can be approximated by ensemble covariances from samples of Nens members.
The Nens nonzero eigenvalues of these matrices give a rough approximation of the Shannon information
content (11) as follows:
1
1 Nens
.
(12)
ln λBi /λA
ln det B0 A0−1 =
i
2
2 i∑
=1
For a small number of ensemble members, the ensemble covariance eigenvalues may poorly represent
the eigenvalues of the true covariances. In this case the resulting estimates of the Shannon information
content are expected to be inaccurate.

3.3. Degrees of freedom for signal
The degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) [21, 15, 2, 28, 32] measures the total reduction in variance and
is deﬁned as

I DFS = trace (In×n − Σ) = n − trace B0−1/2 A0 B0−1/2 = n − trace B0−1 A0

.

(13)

To estimate this metric we assume that the model operator (1) is linear (Mt0 →ti = Mi ), the observation
operator in (2) is also linear (H = Hi ), and both the background errors and the observation errors are
normally distributed.
Consider running the model with random initial conditions taken from the posterior distribution
x0 ∈ N xA
0 , A0 . Each run results in different values of the 4D-Var cost function; we are interested in
understanding the information provided by the statistics of the ensemble of cost function values. Using
the properties of the quadratic functions of Gaussian random variables we can show that

We now try to estimate the contributions of individual observations. Assume a linear model, linear
observation operators, and Gaussian uncertainties. Denote

Here A0−1 is the Hessian of the 4D-Var cost function, A0 is the analysis covariance matrix at time t0 , and
b = −∇J is the negative gradient of the 4D-Var cost function. The 4D-Var problem is equivalent to
solving the linear system
B
A0−1 · xA
0 − x0 = b .

1052

K. Singh et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1047 – 1055

In addition, we consider the 4D-Var problem of assimilating all the data except y . The second problem
leads to another analysis x0C via
A0−1 − D

· x0C − xB0 = b − b .

A0−1 · x0C − xB0

= b − b + D · x0C − xB0
≈ b − b + D · x0A − xB0
= ( I + D A0 ) · b − b

We assume a case where there are many observations such that the contribution of b to the total right
hand side vector is relatively small, b − b ≈ b, and the contribution of D to the total inverse covariance
is relatively small, A0−1 − D ≈ A0−1 . The following approximations are obtained:
A0−1 · x0C − xB0 ≈ b − b ,

Two modiﬁed initial conditions are computed by (15). If this is not feasible, the background and the
analysis initial conditions can be used, at the price of a larger approximation error. The model is run from
the modiﬁed analysis and the “synthetic observations” H x A are recorded. The model is run again
from the modiﬁed background and the “synthetic observations” H x B are also recorded. Finally, the
model is run from the background state, and the estimate (16) is evaluated for each data point y .
4. Averages with respect to the posterior distribution
The proposed estimates are based on computing expected values with respect to the analysis probability density.

1053

K. Singh et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1047 – 1055

The ﬁrst idea is to sample (approximately) from the posterior error distribution in 4D-Var. Sampling
from the posterior probability density at t0 is challenging since this probability density is not explicitly
computed by 4D-Var. Approximate sampling can be performed using second order adjoints, and computing a few eigenvectors corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues of the inverse Hessian. One approach
is to use the fact that the analysis covariance matrix is approximated by the inverse Hessian of the cost
function evaluated at the optimum [29, 16]. A few eigenvectors corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues of the inverse Hessian are computed; they approximate the principal components of the posterior
error and can be used for approximate sampling from the posterior distribution.
An alternative approach is based on a subspace analysis of 4D-Var and is explained in [7]. This is the
approach used in this paper. It provides the ability to obtain the following sample of initial conditions
from the posterior distribution:
x0r ∈ P A (x0 ) , r = 1, · · · , Nens .
(17)
Based on it we can approximate expected values of any functional f (x) with respect to the posterior
density by posterior ensemble averages as follows:
EA [ f (x0 )] ≈ f (x0 )

A

r =1

f (x0r ) .

(18)

The second idea is to consider samples from the background distribution:
q

x0 ∈ P B ( x0 ) ,

q = 1, · · · , Nens ,

(19)

and to calculate expected values with respect to the posterior density by weighted ensemble averages as
follows:

5. Numerical Experiments
In order to illustrate the estimates of various information metrics described in section 4, we consider a
linear test case. The model is
x k = M · x k −1 ,

k = 1, · · · , 4 ,

xk ∈

10

.

(21)

The model matrix M has eigenvalues log-equally distributed in the interval [10−2 , 102 ]. There are 5 eigenvalues greater than 1 (with the errors growing along the corresponding eigendirections) and 5 eigenvalues
smaller than 1 (with the errors decreasing along the corresponding eigendirections). Observations of odd
numbered states (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) are taken at each step. The background errors are normal and characterized by a diagonal background covariance matrix; the standard deviation of the error in each component
is 10% of the background mean value. The observation errors are assumed normal and independent of
each other; the standard deviation of each observation error is 1% of the reference observation value.
For this problem, analytical solutions are available for the analysis state xA
0 and for the analysis covariance matrix A0 . Based on them a direct evaluation of the different information metrics is possible.
The results are summarized in Table 1 and show that the ensemble estimates of information metrics are
accurate.

6. Conclusions and Future Work
This paper employs several metrics from information theory to quantify the information content of
data in the context of four dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation. The ability to characterize
the usefulness of different data points is important for analyzing the effectiveness of the assimilation
system, for data pruning, and for the design of future sensor systems. The metrics of interest are the trace
of the Fisher information matrix, the Shannon information, the relative entropy, the signal information,
and the degrees of freedom for signal.
Computationally efﬁcient estimates for the information metrics are obtained under the assumptions
that errors have Gaussian distributions, and that the model dynamics are observation operators are linear.
The information content estimation approach is illustrated on a linear test problem. Future work will
focus on applying the estimation methodology on nonlinear systems of interest in applications. We will
seek to quantify the impact of nonlinearity, non-normality, approximation of posterior distributions, and
small sample sizes, on the accuracy of the information content estimates.
