Abstract. Wireless sensor grids are poised for applications where predeployment information is highly available to optimize communication and
computation costs. Using two widely known grid traversal schemes, we critique
the effect of multiple services being rendered by a sensor network onto its
availability. We derive an interesting result using Markovian model to appreciate the effect of load heterogeneity onto node and network lifetimes. Our
mathematical model also analyzes synchronous sleep for its effect on energy
conservation. We also propose a epicenter regulated, asynchronous sleep
scheme which allows nodes to conserve energy yet relay data towards the sink
effectively. The performance results show that the proposed scheme prolongs
network availability in sensor grids.

1 Introduction
Wireless sensor networks are unique in the sense that they are supposed to work unattended. For their longevity, network designers propose schemes that reduce the computation and communication model. The fact that sensor networks have a growing
application in telematics, home control, and ubiquitous services is a relief to sensor
network community, wherein protocol designs are simple yet efficient.
In wireless sensor grids, pre-deployment information is much useful to the designers. They can trim heavy and cumbersome protocols of general purpose sensor networks to have simpler equivalents by exploiting location awareness.
One such kind of information is the type of traffic that flows over the sensor grid
[1]. For non-real time services, traffic flow is highly adjustable. Vice versa, real time
services’ traffic flows have high variance due to greedy approach and resulting contention. Network availability as identified in [2] provides researchers with a baseline
to diagnose and regulate node and network parameters for enhancing operational
lifetime. In [3], the authors suggest a scheme for optimal transmission range distribution to balance out power consumption across sensor nodes as a linear programming

problem. They propose a numerical model that gives upper bounds on energy inefficiencies due to energy balancing strategies. Likewise, in [4], Yang et al. give a dichotomy power control mechanism for prolonging network availability. They split the
sensor network region of interest (ROI) into concentric rings. An algorithm then provides rules for adjusting transmission power such that all nodes dissipate energy
evenly.
In this paper, we analyse sensor grids [5] for gauging the effect of traffic heterogeneity onto their longevity. In [6], we have already derived network availability expression of sensor grids for two widely known lattice path traversal that handle just a
singular traffic type.
The contribution of this paper is to visualize network longevity from the application-centric viewpoint. We appreciate the innate nature of today’s heterogeneous
services i.e., real and non real time services. We also critique the notion that traffic
generated sporadically versus a heavy network load has a multi-dimensional relationship with the longevity of a network. Furthermore, we propose a sleep schedule for
sensor grids that is cognizant of the kind of traffic sensor network supports. Our algorithm allows real-time applications to make the choice of source-dependent sleep
schedules or as spelled out by the sink. Non real-time applications conveniently allow
the sink to announce sleep schedules. The performance results validate the strength of
our proposal when combined with carrier sensing on the link layer. Our design considerations throughout the paper befit well with the state-of-the-art in silicon technology, such as sleep modes of sensor nodes, and in software e.g., TinyOS®.

2 Communication Model and Fundamental Assumptions
Fig. 1 illustrates a sensor grid that supports heterogeneous services viz real and nonreal time services. For the sake of simplicity, the services are classified as both real
time and non real time services. Following assumptions are made to formulate the
model;
− Some sensor nodes generate real time data such as tracking information for military applications. It is typical example of a push model. Here traffic shaping is impossible.
− Other sensor nodes generate non real time data. A buffer, again shown in Fig. 1,
gives an allowance to the network to shape the traffic in order to avoid collisions.
First-in-first-out and drop tail are the queuing and scheduling mechanism enforced.
− Carrier sensing such as MACA is supported.
− Unicast communication is adopted. Link layer information such as remaining battery of one hop neighbours can determine the right of way for the next node to
transmit, amongst the downstream neighbours.
− hij is the initial energy of the sensor node (i,j) at the reference time t0, distributed
−η t
across the network as ηij e ij with mean 1/ηij.
− Sensing processes, both for real and non real-time applications are temporally
independent We assume Poisson distribution with mean λ i j [7]. We further denote
this variable with subscripts r (real time) and nr (non real-time) to distinguish between the two traffic types.

− Energy consumptions due to these activities are exponentially distributed with
mean 1 / β i j and 1 / γ i j respectively.
− Sensor node (i,j) consumes energy at a rate of a i j per second to remain awake.
− Sensor node (i,j) consumes energy at a rate of a ′i j per second during the time they
sleep. While a node is sleeping, it does not perform relaying for other nodes’ data.
For the sake of simplicity in analytical modeling, we consider a sleeping node to
behave the same as a dead node—especially in the context of routing. The dead
node creates holes that result into network partitions.

3 Numerical Analysis of Network Availability
We denote yij as the total energy consumed by sensor node (i,j) in sensing, relaying,
during sleep, and in idle mode. Furthermore, xij denotes energy consumption just
being sensing and relaying data only. Ft(xij), ∀ij={11, …,1k,21,…,2k,…n1,…,nk} is
the joint probability density function (pdf) of all nodes at time t. Since Poisson processes are pure birth processes, the joint pdf of all the sensor nodes can be given by the
differential-difference equation as

In this paper, we analyze a synchronous sleep mode as identified in [8] for sensor
nodes on detecting no activity. The total energy consumption of entire sensor
network is now characterized by a single node’s energy consumption, i.e.,
y i j =x i j +a i j t 1 +a ′ i j t 2 ; t1 and t2 being the awake and sleep times respectively and that

Considering two unicast data relaying models, i.e., Delannoy number-based and
staircase lattice path traversals, we analyze the effect of traffic load and traffic heterogeneity on the network availability. If the transmission range is adjusted to R1 as
shown in Fig. 1, staircase lattice links (ÍÐ) are used en-route to relay data from
the sensing node to the gateway, and assuming a square topology, (4) can be transformed as

⎧⎪ ⎡

Similarly, adjusting the power levels to transmission range of R2, the data relaying
activity turns out to be a different lattice path traversal (ÍÐÓ), as given by Delannoy numbers [6]. The network availability of (4) is now given as

The parameters in (5) and (6) are all assumed to be independent of i, j, l, m, and the
traffic type, i.e., aij=a, a′ij=a′, λij=λ, βij=β, ηij=η, ηlm=η, and γlm=γ. Numeric values are

12960 J, 1/β = 42.61 J, 1/γS = 140.87 J for staircase and 1/γD = 280 J for Delannoy.
The number of nodes varies from 4 (or n = 2) to 1600 (or n = 40).

(a) Varying inter-node distance

(b) Varying traffic of all sensor nodes

Fig. 2. Difference between network availabilities under topology size and traffic load variation

Fig. 2 (a) is the difference between (6) and (5) to show the effect of inter-node distance variation onto network availability. It was observed at t=1000000 seconds
(11.57 days). The grid size was varied with a step size of 150 m. When the inter-node
distance is increased for a fixed number of sensor nodes, staircase is a better choice
for relaying until the network size becomes exceedingly large, for which Delannoy
performs better.
Fig. 2 (b) is the difference between (6) and (5) to show the effect of traffic load and
heterogeneity onto network availability. For medium to very large networks, e.g., for
networks with nodes exceeding 1600, Delannoy offers better performance for increasing traffic load. For heterogeneous sources, Delannoy is poised to given a performance gain as for real-time traffic, diagonal paths are available for immediate data
delivery. For delay-flexible traffic staircase equalises in performance.

4 Traffic Type-Cum-Load Aware Sleep Schedules for Sensor
Grids
For the sake of simplicity in numerical modelling, we adopted synchronous sleep
mode for the sensor grids. To capture the behaviour of sensor grid under asynchronous sleep schedule (sensing fidelity is relatively higher here) is NP-hard problem.
Since such sleeping nodes do not participate in relaying activity [8], more sleeping
nodes contribute to frequent path failures. Energy conservation through sleep mode is
compromised by packet loss and retransmissions. In order to assign sleep schedules to
sensor nodes, three considerations must be taken into account
I) Total number of paths available for a node to relay data. It can be computed by
n

the two relay models presented here. For Delannoy it is ∑
k=0

for staircase it is

(2n − 2) !
( n − 1) !( n − 1) !

.

(n) !

(n + k ) !

( n − k ) !( k ) ! ( n ) !( k ) !

. Likewise,

II) The total relay load a node carries. For a node ij, upto (n-i+1)(n-j+1)-1 nodes
relay data through it. If the nodes adopt asynchronous sleep mode, and sleeping probability of each node is Ps, the minimum probability that data from node (i,j) will be
delivered successfully is given b y P D = (1 - P s )[i + j - 2 ]( P s ) [i×j-( i + j ) - 2 ].
III) Type of traffic and data. For two kinds of traffic and their impact onto sleep
schedules, it is important to consider their effects first in isolation and then in association to other factors such as upstream nodes and relay load. E.g., for real time applications, data loss is compensated through retransmissions, while for non real time
traffic, buffering can be exploited too.
Non real time applications however fit well with sleep schedules spelled out by the
sink such that every node is mindful of the sleep schedule of its downstream
neighbours. Real time applications may also be given a leeway to make local
decisions.
4.1 Deterministic Sleep Mode Adoption

When a node selects a downstream relay agent, it registers with that agent through a
registration request. This control packet is a notification of letting the downstream
neighbour know of a prospective sender. Additional information such as start
time , whether real time or non real time traffic, and expected duration may also be specified here. Registration process continues till the epicenter.
The epicenter compiles and propagates a final record of all the applications for which
it will relay the data. This compilation is subsequently used by the node to adjust its
sleeping schedule as described through Fig 3.

Fig. 3. Epicenter computes sleep schedule and shares with one hop neighbours

5 Performance Analysis
A simulator based on the system in section IV was developed in C++ to evaluate our
scheme.
Fig. 4 (a) illustrates simulation results obtained for staircase lattice path traversal
under the three scenarios as shown in the legend. The advantage using our scheme is
clear. Nodes closer to the gateway either do not sleep or sleep less. Thus they do not
loose any routing data, resulting into network-wide energy saving when compared
with uniform sleeping scheme and no sleep at all.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we study wide range of parameters for wireless sensor grids. In particular, we focus on the relaying activity and traffic type for network longevity. We
conclude that Delannoy performs better for real time applications by providing an
additional path per hop. It also provides a gain in network availability due to reduction in hops for very large networks.
We propose a non-uniform, sleep scheme that is aware of the traffic load type of
upstream neighbours. The paradox that nodes closer to the gateway sleep less yet
enhance overall network connectivity and longevity is an important finding. The performance results show that the proposed scheme prolongs network availability effectively in sensor grids.
