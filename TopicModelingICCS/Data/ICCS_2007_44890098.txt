Abstract. To describe spatial and temporal characteristics of the activities of
wintertime planetary waves in the northern hemisphere, their numbers and
periods were precisely calculated, based on NCAR/NCEP reanalysis data. The
objective variables include sea level pressure (SLP) and anomaly stream
function at 850 hPa, 500 hPa and 200 hPa. 2D FFT and spectral analysis reveal
that: (1) The wave numbers 1 and 2 dominate the perturbation pattern at 70ο-80
οN zonal belt. (2) The wave numbers 1, 2 and 3 dominate at 60ο-70οN zonal
belt. (3) The wave numbers 1-4 dominate at 50ο-60οN zonal belt. The results
accord fairly well with Rossby’s classical trough formula and are of potential
use for understanding the northern hemisphere large-scale oscillations.
Keywords: Planetary wave, Large-scale oscillations, Northern hemisphere,
Wave number.

1 Introduction
According to Rossby’s [1] previous work on the relationship between variations in
the intensity of the zonal circulation of the atmosphere and the displacements of the
semi-permanent centers of action, it is well known that the planetary waves have
significant impact on the troposphere circulation. Based on the trough formula, as is
often called, Rossby roughly calculated the number of the long stationary waves and
their wavelength.
Recent studies reveal that the northern hemisphere climate takes on some kinds of
oscillations, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) [2] and the Pacific North American pattern (PNA). These features have close
relationship with the planetary wave activities. Cavalieri and Häkkinen [3] reported
the variability of SLP planetary waves and related these planetary-scale variations
with some changes of climate observed in the Arctic over the last fifty years. Yu [4]
proposed a stationary wave-2 frame to relate the NAO, AO and NPO on the basis of

Hoskins’ great circle theory. Here the analysis to the higher levels in the troposphere
is further extended to demonstrate the planetary wave activities and to show their
climate impact.

2 Analysis and Results
The monthly SLP and wind data at 850hPa, 500hPa and 200hPa levels from the
NCAR/NCEP Reanalysis Data [5] are used here. Their anomalies are deduced by
extracting the corresponding climatologies. The time covers from 1948 to 2003. To
examine the characteristics of the planetary-scale wave, only the rotational part of the
wind field is kept. It is conducted by decomposing the wind field into non-divergent
K
K
part Vψ plus an irrotational part Vφ according to the Helmholtz theorem [6]. Thus the
stream function ψ is introduced as:

ς = ∇ 2ψ

(1)

where the ς is the vorticity. The global stream function corresponding to the
rotational part of the wind anomaly is acquired through Eq.(1) with the aid of the
Fishpack program package [7]. Then the following analysis is conducted on the basis
of SLP and the stream functions at 850 hPa, 500 hPa and 200 hPa levels.

Furthermore, the analysis focuses on three ten-degree latitude bands from 50ο N to 80ο
N latitude, with the January being used as the representative of the wintertime.
We chose 200 hPa, 500 hPa and 850 hPa layers as the representatives of the upper,
middle and lower troposphere. The temporal and spatial structure of the planetaryscale wave revealed by the 2D FFT is shown in Fig.1 respectively for the anomalous
SLP and the stream functions at upper, middle and lower troposphere. Also the
fraction of variance accounted by different waves is shown in Table 1. As for the case
of SLP, the wave structure shows different characteristics in three bands. For the 70ο80οN band, the significant fraction of the variance in SLP is carried by wave 1, which
accounts for over 71% of the total variance. The energy in shorter waves increases
significantly with the decrease of the latitude. The wave 2 in 60ο-70οN band and the
wave 3 in 50ο-60οN band vary significantly, and they account for over 19 % and 5%
of the total variance respectively. This tendency also exists in the stream functions,
which has the generally similar energy distribution in the wave number space with the
intensity of variation increasing from 850 hPa to 200 hPa level. As for the stream
functions, the structures of waves 1-2 in70ο-80οN band, waves 1-3 in 60ο-70οN band
and waves 1-4 in 50ο-60οN band dominate the variance and explain over 90% of the
total variance. From the lower level to the upper level of the troposphere, the
perturbation has the similar pattern in the three bands. The result accords well with
the qualitative estimate of the stationary wave length given by Rossby’s trough
formula.
The 2D FFT gives further information on the temporal characteristics of the
spatial structure mentioned above. Waves of different length scale have different
characteristics of the time evolution. [3] pointed out that the phases of waves 1 and
2 in 70ο-80οN band have significant peaks at 3.6, 5.6 and 12.5 years for SLP field.
The present analysis focuses on the amplitude of the variation but not on the phase.
However, the temporal characteristic can also be seen from Fig. 1. The powers of
waves 1, 2 and 3 in 50ο-80οN band show concentration peaks at 2.9-, 3.6-, 4.4-,
5.6-, 6.9-, 12.5-, near 14-, near 33-, and near 60-year periods both for SLP and for
stream functions. The 3.6-year period is likely related to atmospheric circulation
changes with El Nino [8]. The 5.6-year period is probably associated with the
variability in Arctic sea ice extent [9]. The reason for the decadal and the
interdecadal signals is not clear and needs further exploration. It should be noted
that the 5.6-year period is most significantly associated with the wave 2 structure in
60ο-70οN band, while the decadal signal is most significantly associated with the
wave 1 structure in all the three bands and with the wave 3 structure just in 50ο-60ο
N band. Except for the decadal signal, the interannual (here are 2.9-, 3.6- and 6.9year periods) signal is also very significantly associated with wave 1 structure in
high latitude bands. This may cast some light on their physical interpretation.
ENSO has its global influence through the Rossby wave propagation and dispersion
on the sphere and thus the signal can be detected at all the three bands. The Arctic

sea ice extent variation can cause the large-scale perturbation, which directly
influences the high latitude region because the perturbed long Rossby wave
propagates in the zonal and northward direction but not in southward direction
according to Hoskins’ great circle theory [10].

The spatial-temporal structure is further explored by power spectrum analysis with the
time series (1948-2003) of the variances accounting for waves 1-4, as shown in Fig. 2.
The fraction of variance is calculated with the FFT of the anomalous quantity
subtracted from the zonal average for each calendar January. The time evolution
further supports the above conclusion of the wave structure at three latitude bands. It
has been known from Table 1 that waves 1 and 2 dominate the variance for 60ο-80οN
band. An interesting point here is that the waves 1 and 2 in 60ο-80οN band vary out of
phase, i.e. they alternatively dominate the variance among most of years and only
coexist in few years. The out-of-phase evolution of different wave structures exists
from the surface to the upper troposphere level. Also the overall wave structures keep
well vertically.

3 Discussion and Conclusion
It is anticipated from Rossby’s pioneering work that the stationary long Rossby wave
stands in the northern hemisphere and has close relationship to the intensity of the
semi-permanent action center. Based on the NCAR/NCEP reanalysis data, the idea is
fully examined and it is shown from the diagnosis that the variation of the perturbed
SLP and stream functions from lower to upper troposphere has rather systematic
structure. Waves 1-4 dominate the variance pattern at 50ο-60οN band, while waves 13 and 1-2 dominate it in 60 ο -70 ο N band and in 70 ο -80 ο N band respectively. The
significant wave structure accounts for over 90% of the total variance.

According to Hoskins’ great circle theory, an important application of the wave
structure is that the large scale climate variability in the northern hemisphere can be
understood from the point of view of the teleconnection. Large scale Rossby wave
can transfer the perturbation information along the ray path around the sphere. Thus
the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and the oscillation in the north
Pacific are likely to be connected through the wave process. Given the perturbation
source at the north Atlantic, the signal can propagate northeastward as the form of
planetary wave and cross through the Arctic region to the north Pacific. However, the
assumption should be further explored with the data analysis and model works.
