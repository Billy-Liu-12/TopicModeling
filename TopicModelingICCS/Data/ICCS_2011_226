A robust approximation for setting target inventory levels in a
constrained production environment

Abstract

A model is developed to calculate the inventory target level required to provide a specified service level in a
single-item single-stage inventory when production is subject to a capacity constraint. The model provides a reliable
alternative when the exact Markov chain method is intractable, and where known approximations become unreliable
due to high demand variability. The model derives the inventory shortfall distribution by simulating the
unconstrained inventory process, from which the parameters of a continuous approximation are estimated. The
inventory target level required to provide a desired service level can then be calculated efficiently.
This new model requires that only one simulation trial is conducted, from which the optimization is then
performed. It is thus an efficient alternative to conventional simulation-based optimization. By simulating the
shortfall directly, the model makes no assumptions about the form of the demand distribution. By requiring no user
modeling this new method is easily used by inventory managers in practice. The model is robust, with accuracy
diminishing only by small degree under increased demand variability or production constraint. The degree of
reliability increases as the desired service level increases. Sample size has little effect on the accuracy of forecast
service levels.

1. Introduction
In order to service uncertain customer demand in the presence of production constraints, inventory managers
usually carry safety stock to meet the shortfall between customer demand and the quantity of stock that can be
produced within the supply lead time. Depending on the situation, any items not supplied in a timely manner may be
back ordered or the sale might be lost. In most typical supply chains, lost sales or back orders are considered events
to be avoided; however, economical and practical concerns mean that it is not feasible, or possible, to hold sufficient
safety stock to guarantee supply in all situations. Instead, managers, using a service-oriented approach to inventory
planning, determine the level of safety stock that is sufficient to supply customer demand without delay with a
certain probability, known as the service level of the system.

Safety stock, and hence service level, is managed by setting an inventory target level. This is the level of
inventory that an inventory manager aims to have remaining on hand at the end of each production/replenishment
cycle. Key to setting the service level is an accurate model of the probability distribution for the amount by which
the inventory level falls short of a specified target level at the end of each production/supply cycle. In the current
literature, the shortfall distribution is modeled either in its exact discrete form as a Markov chain describing
inventory level transitions, or as a continuous approximation derived from an estimate of the demand distribution
[1]. A limitation of the exact Markov approach is that it is computationally intensive when the state space of the
shortfall distribution is large. The alternative continuous approximation may be employed in this situation; however,
this method is inaccurate when the variability of customer demand is large [2].
When it is not possible to model the shortfall distribution, the normal recourse for setting safety stock is to
simulate the inventory process and calculate the service level achieved by a certain target level. However,
simulation-based approaches are inefficient because many scenarios must be evaluated in order to reveal the target.
Although some simulation software can automate the task of optimization via simulation, the process remains
computationally intensive.
In contrast to existing approaches, the model in this paper approximates the shortfall distribution directly from
the customer demand distribution using discrete-event simulation. Previous research has shown that the shortfall has
a mass exponential distribution [3]. By estimating the parameters of the simulated shortfall, the service level
achieved by a particular target level can be computed directly from the historical demand and production constraint.
Using an efficient search technique it is possible then to determine the target inventory level required to produce a
given service level to a high degree of accuracy.
The proposed model is robust, enabling target levels to be calculated for situations that could not be contemplated
using either of the existing approaches. Computational experiments show that the accuracy of the model diminishes
only to a small degree as the production system is subject to increased production constraint or increased demand
variability. These experiments also show that the amount of historical demand data on which the model is based has
little impact on the model’s accuracy. Finally, the method is computationally efficient compared with simulationbased techniques for setting inventory target levels by requiring that only a single simulation run be conducted.
This paper makes several contributions to the modeling and management of inventories. From a modeling
perspective, the key insight of the paper is that the inventory shortfall distribution can be approximated from the
demand data and production constraint by directly simulating the unbounded inventory process and determining the
parameters of the resulting distribution. Thus, no explicit description of the demand distribution is required in the
setting of an inventory target level. The model functions with a high level of accuracy in situations where existing
approaches either fail or are computationally intractable. Thus, the present model presents a method for setting
service levels where previously the only real alternative was simulation. The consequence of the model for
inventory management in practice is that a manager, having very little mathematical expertise, could compute
inventory target levels by entering historical demand, production constraint and desired service level directly into a
spreadsheet or similar application. Alternatively the model could be incorporated into a computer-based inventory
management or decision support system.
The following section outlines existing approaches to modeling the inventory shortfall distribution, including the
theory on which the subsequent model is based. In Section 3 the model is derived. Section 4 presents computational
experiments. Section 5 summarizes and concludes the report.
2. The capacity-constrained production model
The single-item, single-stage, inventory system considered in this paper assumes that production and supply
follow the following protocol. At the start of each period, demand is observed. Demand for items in each period is
an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable Dt . Production then takes place, based on the
quantity demanded and the number of items currently in inventory. Production is limited to a maximum of C units
per period. If the production quantity plus the amount currently held in inventory is less than the demand during the
period, then all customer order are filled, otherwise the unmet demand is back ordered. The model given here is
based on that presented in [1, 2, 4], where the general applicability of this model to replenishment systems, and the

1264

John Betts / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1262–1271

adaptability of this system to cases where demand is not known prior to production, or where production follows
demand after a certain lead time, are also discussed.
The optimal way of managing inventory in the single-stage system described here is to employ an order-up-to or
base stock policy [5, 6]. This requires that a target level, s , be determined, which is the amount of stock ideally held
at the end of each production replenishment cycle. Because demand is random, production in all periods will not be
sufficient to cover demand for that period. Consequently, in some periods there will be a shortfall, whereby the
actual end of cycle inventory is smaller than s . The shortfall each period, vt , is determined as vt s  It , where It
represents the inventory level at the end of each period. vt is a random variable with a value in any period
determined only by current demand and production quantity, and the previous shortfall, that is,
vt max vt 1  Dt  C , 0  . The condition that E >Dt @  C ensures that an infinite backlog of unmet demand does not
build up. Under this condition the inventory process is ergodic, and hence a steady state distribution exists for vt ,
denoted by V [4]. Once the shortfall distribution is known, the service level obtained with a certain inventory target
level can be calculated directly. Two methods for determining V are now discussed.
In the case of discrete demand, the shortfall process can be modeled as a Markov chain with the transition matrix
derived from C and the demand distribution D . V can be derived as the limiting distribution of the Markov chain
[4, 7]. A problem with this approach to obtaining V in this way is that in situations where the state space is large,
evaluating the limiting distribution becomes computationally intractable. Although the range of V is, in theory,
infinite, in cases where E >V @ is small, the state space matrix can be truncated as an aid to computation without
significant loss off accuracy. In situations of high demand variability or resource utilization though, E >V @ will
necessarily be large, limiting the degree of truncation.
One way of addressing the problem of dimension arising in the Markovian approach when E >V @ is large is to
assume that the demand distribution is continuous. Under this condition, V is also continuous and has a mass
exponential distribution, which is of the form PV 0 P0 , where 0 d P0 d 1 , with the remainder of the distribution
having an exponential distribution with mean J 1 [4]. Thus, using FV to denote the complementary cumulative
distribution function of V , i.e., the upper tail,
­° P e  Jv , v ! 0

(1)

FV provides a good approximation to V for a wide variety of demand distributions with the degree of
approximation improved at critical percentiles approaching 1; when Dt is exponential, V is exact [3].
Approximations have been determined for the parameters P0 and J under a variety of demand distribution
assumptions and service measures [2].
When the coefficient of demand variation is greater than 2 the approximations for determining the parameters of
FV are unreliable [2]. This precludes the use of these approximations in many realistic settings, such as lumpy
demand [8]. It may also be the case that historical demand cannot be modelled by a continuous parametric
distribution. If it is also the case that E >V @ is sufficiently large to render the Markovian approach infeasible, there
are few alternatives left to the practitioner wanting to determine inventory service levels. In this situation, discreteevent simulation of the inventory process under different target levels can be used as a basis for determining the
given service level or average costs associated with particular service levels. However, because stochastic
simulation is not an optimization method of itself, it is necessary that multiple trials be undertaken to identify the
required s to give a particular service level. When the range of V , and hence, s , is large, this process is also
computationally intensive. Simulation-optimization may be made more efficient by using heuristics for efficient
parameter space search, for example, response surface methodology [9] or metamodelling [10]. However, the
optimization process remains unwieldy.
This paper presents a model for setting inventory target levels in situations a manager would normally only have
recourse to simulation-optimization. The model recommends safety stock levels, to a high degree of accuracy, in

John Betts / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1262–1271

1265

cases of high demand variability and/or a high degree of production constraint. These are situations where current
approaches are known to be intractable or less effective due to reduced accuracy outside their intended domain. As
well, the model makes no assumptions about the customer demand distribution, and is computationally efficient
compared with simulation-optimization.
3. The proposed model
The model for setting customer service level for a base stock (or order-up-to) single-item, single-stage inventory
is now described. The model calculates the target inventory level required for a given Type II service level. This is
defined as the proportion of customer demand that is met without delay, and commonly referred to as the fill rate
[11]. For the current model, this means that items are supplied in the same period they are demanded where possible
with the remaining items backordered for supply in following periods. Inputs to the model are: historical demand
observed over k time periods, D ^D1, D2 ,..., Dk `; production constraint, C ; and desired service level, E .
An outline of the proposed model is now described. Each of the main components of the model is then developed
in more detail in the following subsections. The first stage of the model is to generate an empirical approximation of
V by sampling a discrete-event simulation of the unbounded inventory process (assuming s 0 and allowing
inventory assume negative values) and recording the shortfall. This step eliminates the need to create a state space
matrix, and is the only stage of the model requiring simulation. The discrete V is then approximated by the
continuous, mass exponential distribution, FV as described in Equation 1. J and P0 are estimated by fitting a least
squares regression equation to the simulated V . The continuous FV , D and C , can now be used to calculate
service level for a given s . The value of s for a desired service level can then be found by iteration.
3.1. Simulating V
The discrete shortfall distribution V is approximated by a sampling from a discrete event simulation of the
inventory demand/supply process. This simulation model assumes that all demand is supplied, and that the inventory
level, I , can assume negative values. Clearly this model is unrealistic for most real world applications but for this
purpose the process allows the shortfall to develop without constraint, enabling an accurate estimation of the tail of
the distribution.
The condition that E >Dt @  C ensures that the inventory process is ergodic, and is assumed throughout. The
inventory process is simulated over MN periods, sampling every M periods, yielding N observations, recording
shortfall as the negative inventory level. The algorithm is

theory, M could equal 1, however, in the subsequent computational experiments, M 1,000 in order to obtain a
broad traversal of the state space.

Let V be the set of simulated values of the shortfall distribution, that is, V

vi d v j for all i  j . All the simulated values vi

Consider first the case where V has an exponential distribution with mean J 1 (in contrast to the mass
exponential distribution), then V has the theoretical CDF pi P V d vi  1  e  Jvi . For the observed data, pi has
the alternate derivation as the simple probability of each data point being observed at or below a given position in
the ordered set, thus, pi P V d vi  i N . These two alternate derivations of pi enable J to be estimated using
least squares regression.
Transforming the CDF gives  ln 1  pi  / J vi . Thus the relationship between each  ln 1  pi  and vi is, in
theory, linear. Using p i i N and the observed vi , J is estimated as the gradient of the least squares regression of
 ln 1  p  on v . Since  ln 1  0  0 , the regression equation theoretically includes the origin.
When V has a mass exponential distribution, both J and P0 must be estimated. Define P0 PV d v x  then V
can be partitioned into two subsets: V L

is thus the upper portion of V which will be approximated by an exponential distribution having mean J 1 .
x , and hence P0 and J , are determined iteratively in the following way.

A regression equation is fitted to the N  x terms of v H and  ln 1  p  where now pi

Again it can be assumed that in theory, if V H has an exponential distribution, then the least squares regression of
v H on  ln 1  p  contains the origin. Using this assumption, calculating P0 requires that x be varied until the
regression equation yields an intercept suitably close to 0. J is again estimated as the gradient of the least squares

Several factors aid in the efficient computation of x . Firstly, the value of the intercept of the least squares
regression equation is strictly increasing as x increases. This property allows the use of an efficient optimization
technique such as binary search. Secondly, because V L can only comprise zeros, the upper limit for x ,

be the case that P0 0 , in which case V H V . For practical calculations these cases are identified in one of two
ways. Firstly, if v1 ! 0 then by definition P0 0 . Alternatively if the regression over all of V , that is, v on
 ln 1  p  yields an intercept greater than zero, then no better estimate of J (requiring a regression equation
containing the origin) can be obtained by setting x ! 0 .
3.3. Calculating service level
Let Bt denote the amount of stock backordered in any period. Bt is calculated as the demand during the current
period less the maximum production quantity, less the inventory level on hand at the commencement of the current
period. The inventory level on hand in any period can be expressed in terms of the shortfall and the target level as
I t s  vt . The stock on hand at the start of any period is equal to that at the close of the previous period, that is,
s  vt 1  . Thus Bt maxDt  C  s  vt 1 ,0 . Recall that the demand distribution is observed over k instances,
D ^D1 , D2 ,..., Dk ` , with each occurring with equal probability. The expected shortfall in any period when the
inventory level at the commencement of the period is s  vt 1  is thus given by

any significant degree.
4. Computational Experiments
4.1. Introduction
A computational experiment was designed to observe the accuracy of the proposed model under a range of
operating conditions characterized by four factors: demand variability; production constraint; desired service level
and the number of demand observations used for modeling. The four factors were chosen because their known, or
suspected, affect on the functioning of the model and/or because of their relevance to inventory practitioners. k , the
number of historical demand observations used in modeling is an indication of the ‘discreteness’ of the demand
information. At large values of k , D , and hence V , better approximate a continuous demand distribution. The
production constraint, C , determines the capacity of the system to service random variation in demand. This
E> Dk @

measure of production constraint is a directly analogous to the utilization factor in the M/M/1 queuing model. The
coefficient of demand variation,

VD

E> D @

, measures inventory volatility. Type II service level, E , is the proportion of

orders that are filled in the period they are demanded.
The experiment consisted of 1500 trials. For each trial the target level s was calculated for a randomly generated
scenario comprising: historical demand information, D1 , D2 ,..., Dk , production constraint, C , and a desired service
level, ȕ . The accuracy of the model was evaluated in two ways. Firstly, for a given s , the service level predicted by
the model, Es model , was compared against that obtained by simulation, Es sim (see Section 4.3). Secondly, the
variability of the calculated s was determined. Both measures of accuracy were obtained by running multiple
replications of each trial. The computational efficiency of the model was also evaluated by comparing the time taken
to calculate s compared with the time taken to run a single instance of a comparable discrete-event simulation of the
inventory process.

1268

4.2. Data Generation
Data was randomly generated as follows: k was randomly chosen from: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128; Desired service
level and production constraint were both randomly chosen from within the range (0.90 – 0.99).
Demand data was generated as a left-truncated contaminated normal (LTCN) distribution. For each trial, the
mean, P , and standard deviation, V , were first determined randomly as integers on the interval [5, 15], the
contaminating scale factor was 50 and contamination rate 0.1. Each Dt was then generated randomly as

^







`

Dt N P , V 2 with probability 0.9, N P ,50 2 V 2 otherwise , rejecting any observations where Dt  0 until k
observations were obtained.
The LTCN distribution was used to approximate the highly volatile lumpy demand patterns encountered by
inventory practitioners which often require simulation or heuristic methods to set safety stock levels [8]. Use of this
distribution also enabled demand data to be created with a higher degree of demand volatility than could be obtained
using a non-contaminated distribution. The following experiments report coefficients of variation in the range 0, 4 
whereas for a non-contaminated distribution the range is always restricted to 0, 1 regardless of P and V [12].
Data was generated with the intention of testing the proposed model in scenarios that included very high levels of
demand variability and resource constraint and desired service level. This meant that some scenarios were generated
which required extremely large target levels to satisfy the desired service level. Scenarios up to s  200 E >D @ were
included in the analysis although in a realistic setting, these extremely large target levels would lead to inventory
levels too large to be economical. For these situations other inventory performance criteria would come into play, or
the level of service reconsidered, and the inventory target level would be necessarily reduced.

For the both the model building and model testing simulations, N

however the consequence of these settings is discussed as part of the analysis and conclusion.

4.3. Simulation to test the target level
Random data was generated for the following computational experiment to create scenarios where target levels
could not be systematically determined using existing techniques other than simulation. To this end, historical
demand was generated with a high level of volatility which prohibited modeling Vn using approximations of the
demand distribution in the majority of cases. Production constraint and service levels were also set randomly, but
sufficiently close to 1, in order that the state space of Vn be sufficiently large to prohibit the use of Markov chains as
a general method. Thus, for the purpose of evaluating the service level, Es sim , associated with a given s the
following simulation was run.

4.4. Results
The accuracy of the model in achieving a desired service level is determined by comparing the theoretical service
level predicted by the model for the calculated target level, s , with that obtained using a discrete-event simulation
of the inventory process. For each trial, s , was calculated. After which 100 replications of the simulation were then
run, with the absolute error Es model  Es sim calculated for each replication. The Mean Absolute Error, MAE, of
the predicted service level over the 100 replications was then determined for each trial. Simulation of the inventory
process was the only available method of obtaining a comparison service level. This introduced a small error into
the calculation of MAE of approximate magnitude 0.0005 over all trials.

The average MAE of predicted service levels across all trials was approximately 0.001, with approximately 70%
of trials having a MAE d 0.001 and 92% with a MAE d 0.002. Figure 1 shows the MAE for all trials as boxplots
grouped by the operating environment characteristics described above. The boxplots show the systematic effect on
MAE due to the desired service level and demand variation. It is also evident from Figure 1 that production
constraint and the number of historical observations influence the accuracy of the model to only a small degree. The
outliers give an insight into the worst case performance of the model, which was a MAE of approximately 0.005 for
the scenarios analyzed
As the desired service level increases, the MAE of the predicted service level decreases from a median across all
trials of approximately 0.001 when E 0 . 90 to approximately 0.0005 when ȕ 0.99 . Thus, at higher levels of
service, the approximation becomes more accurate. This improved accuracy can be explained by observing the
variability of the predicted s . In Figure 2 it can be seen that the average variability of s is constant with respect to
desired service level. As service levels become more critical, the upper tail of the shortfall distribution, Fv s  ,

diminishes. This means that variation in Fv s  due to the variability of s is reduced at higher desired service levels.
Because back orders are relatively rare when v 0 and much more likely when v s , the effect of the increased

stability of Fv s  on stabilizing Es model is thus more pronounced at higher service levels, (c.f. Equation 3). The
MAE of the predicted service level increases also as demand variability increases for the much the same reason.
The reliability of the model in calculating s was determined by running 100 replications of each trial, calculating
s each time. The coefficient of variation of s (CVS) across each trial was then determined as V s E>s @ .

affected to a small degree by the desired service level, with the average value remaining constant but variability
decreasing as desired service level increases due to the smaller upper tail of Fv s  at higher service levels. Both the
increased production constraint and demand variation lead to increased variability in CVS. This is because increases
in either of these factors result in an increased E >V @ . The consequent increased heaviness in the tail of Fv s  leads
to a greater error in s . CVS is also more variable as production constraint increases because the tighter constraint
increases the size of the state space of V relative to E >V @ at the simulation stage. This suggests that the length of
the simulation trial, N , and the interval between samples, M , may need to be increased in order to get a more
reliable traversal of the state space at high levels of resource constraint. The number of observations used for model
building, k , has only a minor affect on CVS, with the mean CVS increasing slightly as k increases due to the
increased variability in the simulated shortfall distribution.
The average CVS across all trials was approximately 0.005, with 84% of trials having a CVS d 0.01 and 97% d
0.02. The outliers indicate the worst case performance of the model, with the largest error being approximately
0.005. The worst cases corresponded to one of two scenarios. The first being where the predicted s was small ( d
20), in this case the variability of s is large relative to E >s @ . For these cases the exact Markov method may be a
better alternative for computation. The second scenario was where the calculated s was very large as a proportion of
the mean, typically s ! 100 E >D @ . In this case, error is introduced by the high degree of extrapolation required to
calculate s In a realistic setting economic considerations would prevail and these scenarios would require an
alternative inventory performance criteria or a reduction of the desired service level.
As a guide to the computational efficiency of the proposed model, the time taken to calculate s using the model
and the time taken to calculate the simulated service level were recorded. Across all trials, the average time to
calculate s using the model was approximately 1.125 times greater than that required to calculate the simulated
service level. This ratio would however vary with M and N . For the present trials, given that simulation-based
optimization would require numerous trials to determine s , it is clear that the model presents an efficient alternative.
5. Conclusion
This paper has presented an approximate model to calculate the inventory target level required to provide a
specified service level in a single-item single-stage inventory system when production is subject to a capacity
constraint. The model provides a feasible alternative to the exact, Markov chain, method for setting target levels
when the state space of the shortfall distribution is sufficiently large to make computation intractable. The model

also performs well in cases of high demand variability when the parameter estimates of the mass exponential
approximation to the Markov model are unreliable. A further advantage of the approximate model over the existing
continuous approximation to the Markov model is that the new model does not require any estimation of the demand
distribution.
The shortfall distribution is derived empirically by sampling from an unbounded simulation of the inventory
process. This is approximated by a mass exponential distribution with parameters estimated from the simulated
distribution. The inventory target level required for a given service level can then be calculated efficiently using an
iterative search. This new model requires that only one simulation trial be conducted, from which the optimization is
then performed, and is thus an efficient alternative to conventional simulation-based optimization.
The new model determines approximate inventory target levels to a high degree of reliability as verified by
simulation experiments. Operating conditions tested included cases of high production constraint and extremely high
demand variability. The model is robust, with accuracy diminishing only by small degree in situations of high
demand variability or production constraint, extending to cases where the recommended inventory target level was
far greater than could be economically justified by a manager. Sample size, had little effect on the accuracy of
predicted service levels.
As an approximation, the model could be used directly for setting inventory service levels to high degree of
accuracy. The model could also be used to provide an estimate of the inventory target level, from which a
simulation-optimization model could then be used to make a more accurate estimate should this be required. As part
of an inventory decision support system, the proposed model could be used to quickly identify products where
setting a high service level is uneconomical. Alternatively, for strategic investment decisions, the relatively fast
computation of target levels would enable the affect of investments in extra production capacity on inventory
reduction to be evaluated. By requiring no user modeling, such as parameter estimation, this new method for setting
inventory target levels could be easily used by managers in practice.
The current paper has presented the design and implementation of an approximate model for setting target levels
based on a single simulation of the unbounded inventory process. The main contribution of the paper is in showing
that this method is a feasible approximation of exact or near-exact approaches, obtaining results to a high degree of
accuracy across a wider parameter space than could be considered using other methods. Testing has thus far focused
on the accuracy of the model with respect to the parameter space of the inventory system, and not on the
computational speed of the model. To this end, the effect of variables such as simulation length and sample rate has
not been analysed. It is highly likely, for a small state space, that the duration of the simulation trial could be
shortened without reducing model accuracy. Thus the effect of these factors on model accuracy remains to be
systematically investigated. Also, the current simulation trials have concentrated only on one, albeit highly variable,
demand distribution. A fuller study of the accuracy of the model under a wider range of probability demand
distributions remains as a further research direction.
