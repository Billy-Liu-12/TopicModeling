Abstract. Strained silicon field effect transistor (FET) has been known for enhancing carrier mobility. The stained Si channel thickness, the Si1-xGex composition fraction and the Si1-xGex layer thickness are three crucial parameters for
designing strained Si/SiGe MOSFET. Mobility enhancement and device reliability may be unnecessarily conservative. In this paper, numerical investigation
of drain current, gate leakage and threshold voltage for strained Si/SiGe
MOSFET are simulated under different device profiles. According to our results, the optimal combination of parameters are as follows: stained Si channel
thickness is 7 nm, Ge content is 20%, and the Si1-xGex layer thickness should be
chosen between 20~50 nm.

1 Introduction
The introduction of strained Si and SiGe in CMOS technology is a means of improving the performance of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) in the deep submicron era [1-2]. A general approach to introduce biaxial tensile
strain is using a virtual substrate of SiGe [1-2]. The underlying SiGe layer serves as
an anchor to constrain the lattice of the strained silicon on top. Therefore, the electron
mobility, and hence nMOSFET drive current performance, is enhanced. The stained
Si channel thickness (TSi), the Si1-xGex composition fraction (x) and the Si1-xGex layer
thickness (TSG) are three crucial parameters for designing strained Si/SiGe MOSFET.
In this study, computer-aided design (CAD) approach is used to optimize the structure
of strained Si/SiGe device. Drain current, gate leakage and threshold voltage are
simulated and discussed.

2 Quantum Transport Models
The density-gradient (DG) model is considered to couple with the classical transport
models. The hydrodynamic model (HD) [3] provides a very good compromise of
velocity overshoot and the impact ionization generation rates. For the sake of saving
computing time, DD model is used while drain bias (VD) is low (< 0.1). For high-drain
bias, hydrodynamic model is considered. The DD model is given as

equations are discretized by the box discretization [5] and solved. After the drain
current (ID) is obtained, the gate leakage (IG) and threshold voltage (VTH) are determined.

3 Simulated Results and Discussion
In the numerical studies, a 40 nm strained Si/SiGe nMOSFETs is simulated. The
device profile and simulated scenario are given in Fig. 1. According to previous
experimental studies [1-2], the effects of interface trap are also considered in the
numerical simulation.

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate part of the results to show the dependence of ID and IG on
TSG, TSi and x, respectively. Fig. 2(a) demonstrates increasing device performance
with increasing Ge content in the SiGe layer due to higher strain in the Si channel.
However, a higher Ge content also induced higher gate leakage, which is caused by
mismatch of lattice and diffusion of Ge. IG is shown in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 2(b) and Fig.
3(b) illustrate ID and IG under different TSi with x = 20% and TSG = 20 nm. A thinner
TSi performs a larger ID. The reason is that a thin strained Si channel can prevent the
stress relaxation and present a better performance. The lattice mismatch proportionally decreases with increasing TSi. In another word, the relaxation of tensile stress in
the strained Si channel could be suppressed by decreasing TSi, i.e., the mobility enhancement would be larger in the thin TSi device than in the thick TSi device. The
observation in the nanoscale device is different to long-channel devices. Unfortunately, a thin TSi may induce large interface trap caused by Ge diffusion. In this study,
ID and IG of TSi = 5 nm is the largest. IG of TSi = 7, 9, 11 and 15 do not show much
difference. Fig. 2(c) and 3(c) demonstrate ID and IG dependence on TSG. A thicker TSG

provides a larger stress, but a larger number of lattice mismatches is also induced.
Moreover, a thicker TSG may increase Ge diffusion to MOS interface, which contributes to an increased interface state.
For further discussion, Fig. 4 illustrates the VTH shift (V), ID enhancement (%) and
14 nm,
ΔIG/IG (%) of the whole simulation scenario. According to the figure, if TSi
VTH shift may be larger than 0.01 V. As TSi
14 nm, VTH shift is small enough to be
neglected. From Fig. 4 (b), the largest ID enhancement is achieved by TSi = 5 nm, TSG
= 20 nm and Si70%Ge30%. However, the IG induced by the interfacial state is too large
to be accepted. TSi = 5 nm presents a sudden increase of interfacial states. ΔIG/IG is
given in Fig. 4(c). TSi = 7 nm is chosen. Although x = 30% may have a better improvement of drain current, it also have a serious problem of Ge diffusion. Therefore,
x = 20% is suggested. Since a thin SiGe layer cannot provide enough stress to improve drain current, the best case occurs between TSG = 20 ~ 50 nm.

4 Conclusions
In this study, optimal profile of strained Si/SiGe device is suggested by numerical
simulation. Hydrodynamic model is employed and the effect of interface state is considered in the simulation. Considering the improvement of performance and reliability, we suggested that the optimal stained Si channel thickness is 7 nm, Ge content is
20%, and the Si1-xGex layer thickness is between 20~50 nm. The optimal design may
obtain an 8~11% improvement of performance and maintain the same level of gate
leakage for a 40 nm nMOSFET.
