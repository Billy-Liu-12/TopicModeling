Abstract
We present a polynomial chaos based minimum variance formulation to solve inverse problems. The utility of the
proposed approach is evaluated by considering the ash transport problem arising due to volcanic eruption. Volcanic
ash advisory centers generally makes use of mathematical models for column eruption and advection and diﬀusion
of ash cloud in atmosphere. These models require input data on source conditions such as vent radius, vent velocity
and distribution of ash-particle size. The inputs are usually not well constrained, and estimates of the uncertainty in
the inputs is needed to make accurate predictions of cloud motion. The recent eruption of Eyjafjallaj¨okull, Iceland
in April 2010 is considered as test example. For validation, the puff advection and diﬀusion model is used to
hindcast the motion of the ash cloud through time concentrating on the period 14-16 April 2010. Variability in
the height and loading of the eruption is introduced through the volcano column model bent. Output uncertainty
due to uncertain input parameters is determined with a polynomial chaos quadrature (PCQ)-based sampling of the
multidimensional puﬀ input vector space. Furthermore, the posterior distribution for input parameters is obtained by
assimilating satellite imagery data with PCQ predictions using a minimum variance approach.
Keywords: inverse problem, source parameter estimation, polynomial chaos, minimum variance estimator

1. Introduction
Across the world, ash clouds are produced by explosive eruptions from volcanoes. These clouds are a serious
hazard to aircraft, causing damage to the engines [1]. More recently, the eruption at Eyjafjallaj¨okull, Iceland, has
wreaked havoc on European aviation after the eruption started on April 14, 2010. In this case, the closure of European
air-space resulted in more than $4 billion in economical losses and with more than 10 million stranded passengers[2].
With the growing fear of natural, accidental or deliberate release of toxic agents, there is tremendous interest in

generating accurate hazard maps of toxic material dispersion and multi-hypothesis forecasting for appropriate disaster
management.
Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) routinely use both satellite data and numerical modeling to assist in their
planning for hazard response and mitigation. At present, examination of satellite data provides the best quantitative
method for detecting and analyzing ash clouds. However, satellite imagery data is limited in terms of the kind and
frequency of observations that can be taken and may only provide access to limited aspects of the dispersion of ash
cloud. For example, satellite images can only tell where the ash was. To predict the position and motion of ash
clouds, advection/dispersion models are solved numerically. For example, during the Eyjafjallaj¨okulleruption, the
London VAAC used the NAME computational model [3] of ash advection and dispersion to make predictions of
the likely position of the ash cloud and issue advisories to the airline industry. Other VAACs use diﬀerent but similar
computational models. These models may incorporate stochastic variability, such as a varying windﬁeld that transports
ash particles. In addition, these models often require input data on source conditions such as eruption plume height
that is not well characterized. These factors cause overall accuracy to degrade as the model output evolve. The fusion
of observational (satellite) data with numerical simulation promises to provide greater understanding of physical
phenomenon than either approach alone can achieve. In other words, the optimal solution should be a weighted
mixture of model forecast and observation data.
Both the ENSEMBLE platform (http://ensemble2.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) and the Harmonisation initiative (http://harmo.org)
point to the importance of ensemble forecasting in numerical weather prediction and dispersion modeling. Work under both ENSEMBLE and Harmonisation umbrellas has laid out many of the principles and pathways to ensemble
forecasting, and progress has been made on presenting the results of tens of model runs in a coherent fashion [4].
Nevertheless, rigorous sampling strategies that can be implemented in a reasonable time, and quantitative estimation
of central tendency in outputs together with error estimates, are still lacking. the main objective of this contribution is
to provide accurate estimates for volcano source parameters along with associated statistical bounds. This approach
had its birth with the development of the Kalman Filter [5].
Kalman Filter (KF) is the optimal Bayesian estimator for linear systems with initial condition and measurement
errors assumed to be Gaussian. However, the performance of the Kalman ﬁlter can deteriorate appreciably due to
model parameter uncertainty [6, 7]. The sensitivity of the KF to parametric modeling errors has led to the development
of several robust ﬁltering approaches; robust in the sense that they attempt to limit, in certain ways, the eﬀect of
parameter uncertainties on the overall ﬁlter performance. Alternatively, when the model parameters are uncertain, the
estimation is carried out through the simultaneous estimation of states and parameters (also viewed as states), which
results in a nonlinear ﬁltering problem even for otherwise linear systems [8]. Methods like the extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) [6] or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) [9] have been used to estimate model parameters along with
state estimates. Although both the EKF and UKF based ﬁlters are very popular for simultaneous state and parameter
estimation problems, both methods are based upon very restrictive Gaussian error assumption for both parameter and
state uncertainty. Clearly, the Gaussian assumption can work well for moderately nonlinear systems but it might not
be appropriate at all for certain problems based upon the physical model. For example, Gaussian distribution is not
an ideal distribution to represent errors in the eruption column height which is a positive quantity. This necessitates
the need for ﬁlters which can incorporate the knowledge about non-Gaussian uncertainty. Various researches have
endeavored to exploit knowledge of statistics, dynamic systems and numerical analysis to develop nonlinear ﬁltering
techniques [10–13] which cater to the various classes of state and parameter estimation problems. For low-order
nonlinear systems, the Particle Filter (PF) [12, 13] has been gaining increasing attention. However, Daum in his
seminal work[14] discusses that various factors like volume of state space in which conditional pdf is non-vanishing,
rate of decay of the conditional pdf in state space, stationarity of the problem, eﬀective dimensionality of the problem,
etc. strongly aﬀect the computational complexity and performance of the particle ﬁlter [14].
Recently, the polynomial chaos (PC) based estimation algorithms have garnered attention for parameter estimation
problem. The main principle of the PC approach is to expand random variables using polynomial basis functions that
are orthogonal with respect to the pdf of the parameters (Hermite polynomials for normally distributed parameters,
Legendre for uniformly distribution, etc.), and transform stochastic equations into deterministic equations in higher
dimensional projection space using Galerkin collocation. The polynomial chaos has been used in diﬀerent ways for
parameter estimation problem also popular in literature as inverse problem. The PC approach has been successfully
used in conjunction with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for input parameter estimation [15]. Pence et al. [16]
have used the PC formulation to obtain maximum likelihood estimates for input parameters while Blanchard et al.

[17] have used the PC formulation in a Bayesian framework to provide the a-posteriori estimates. In Refs. [18],
the PC based minimum variance estimator have been developed to provide estimates for posterior moments of both
parameters and system states. The main advantage of this approach is that it provides point estimates for both the
state and parameters along with statistical conﬁdence bounds associated with these estimates described in terms of
the posterior moments. In this paper, we will utilize this minimum variance estimator to estimate posterior density
function for volcano source parameters.
2. Volcanic Plume Models
Particle transport models can be divided into two broad categories: those intended to calculate eruption column
characteristics based on tephra fall deposits, as in [19], and those intended to predict long-range atmospheric and
deposit distributions based on the scale of the eruption, as in [20]. Both types of models rely on the existence of an
explicit relationship between the eruption and atmospheric dynamics and the resulting fall deposit. This relationship
is complicated by a number of factors, including plume mechanics, variable weather conditions, and particle reentrainment. Our interest is in the movement of ash clouds, and not in tephra deposition. Therefore, we focus
attention on long-range modeling and consider a simple particle transport model, but one that nonetheless contains
several sources of uncertainty.
Tanaka [21] and Searcy et al. [22] developed puff, an ash tracking model for predicting the paths of young
volcanic clouds. puff simpliﬁes the eruption plume to a vertical source, and uses a Lagrangian pseudo-particle
representation of the ash cloud in a detailed 3-D regional windﬁeld to determine the trajectory of the cloud. puff and
other dispersion models have proven extremely useful in modeling the distal transport of ash for aviation safety [22].
During an eruption crisis, puff predictions have been used to estimate ash cloud movement critical to the assessment
of potential impacts – for example, on aircraft ﬂight paths. puff has been validated against historic volcanic eruptions
such as the 1992 Crater Peak vent eruption at Mount Spurr and the 2006 eruption at Mount Augustine with reasonable
success [22, 23].
To initialize a puff simulation a collection of particles of diﬀerent sizes must be speciﬁed as a function of altitude.
This distribution is often inferred from historical eruption and plume observations, and is not well constrained; see
[24–26]. It is important to remember that puff particles are not simple surrogates for ash concentration, but are
representatives of ejecta of a given size at some initial height. As such this number is a user-selected input, and aﬀects
the simulation time and resolution of the output. In addition to particle distribution and windﬁeld, other puff input
parameters include the coeﬃcients of turbulent diﬀusion and particle fallout, both of which are estimated.
Instead of guessing the initial particle distribution as a function of height, we employ a volcanic eruption plume
model called bent to provide initial conditions; the essential features of this coupling are described in [26]. bent
solves a cross-sectionally averaged system of equations for continuity, momentum and energy balance [24–26], as a
function of the eruption vent radius and speed of the ejecta. bent assumes a distribution of pyroclasts of diﬀerent
sizes, and the model equations then predict the height distribution of the various sized clasts. bent has been tested
against plume rise height data, and against dispersal data [24]; the discussion in that paper corroborates that the scaling
relationships derived in [27] between energy and plume rise height are valid for energetic volcanic plumes piercing
the tropopause.
Using bent to provide initial conditions for puff incorporates important plume physics into our cloud transport
simulations. On the one hand, physics guides our model coupling and largely determines for us how outputs from
bent feed into puff. On the other hand, this coupling can be thought of as substituting one set of uncertain parameters
(vent size, velocity, clast size distribution) for an uncertain function (initial particle height distribution). In this way,
inputs from the source, together with their variability, can be modeled and propagated through bent and puff. A
detailed sensitivity analysis could relate the variations in input parameters to characteristics of the cloud as output, but
this result is itself somehat incomplete. Instead we employ uncertainty analysis, which casts a much broader net in
terms of assessing conﬁdence of predictions based on all available information.
3. Methodology
In the standard puff model, one tracks the position of representative particles as they are transported by wind and
turbulence, and the position of each parcel is assumed to be a deterministic quantity. Instead of solving for the point

1132

position of the puff particles, we consider the particles representing a probability distribution. That is, the position of
a particle is assumed to be a random variable, xk , whose time evolution is given by a stochastic diﬀerential equation,
which should be thought of as generalizing the puff advection/diﬀusion equation, written generically as:
x˙ = f(t, x, Θ)

(1)

In Eq. (1), Θ represents uncertain volcano source parameters such as the vent radius, vent velocity, mean grain size
and grain size variance. The total uncertainty associated with the state vector xk = x(tk ) is characterized by the
probability distribution function (pdf) p(tk , xk ). The index k denotes the discrete time-step in the evolution of p. That
is, we replace the time evolution of the state vector xk by the time evolution of the pdf p(tk , xk ).
Several approximate techniques exist in the literature to approximate the state pdf evolution, the most popular
being Monte Carlo (MC) methods [28], Gaussian closure [29], and Equivalent Linearization [30]. All of these algorithms except MC methods are similar in several respects, and are suitable only for linear or moderately nonlinear
systems, because the eﬀect of higher order terms can lead to signiﬁcant errors. Monte Carlo methods require extensive
computational resources and eﬀort, and become increasingly infeasible for high-dimensional dynamic systems [14].
The next section discusses the Polynomial Chaos Quadrature (PCQ) method for solving the time evolution of state
pdf for systems that include initial condition and parametric uncertainty.
3.1. Polynomial Chaos Quadrature
The propagation of uncertainty due to time-invariant but uncertain input parameters can be approximated by a
generalization of polynomial chaos [31]. Generalized PC is an extension of the homogenous chaos idea of [32] and
involves a separation of random variables from deterministic ones in the solution algorithm for a stochastic diﬀerential
equation. The random variables are expanded in a polynomial expansion. Suitably chosen polynomials converge
rapidly to the assumed pdf for the input variables.
x˙ (t, Θ) = f(t, Θ, x),

x(t0 ) = x0

(2)

where u(t) is the input of dynamic system at time t, x(t, Θ) = [x1 (t, Θ), x2 (t, Θ), · · · , xn (t, Θ)]T ∈ Rn represents the
stochastic system state vector, and uncertain parameter vector Θ = [Θ1 , Θ2 , · · · , Θm ]T ∈ Rm is assumed to be time
invariant and function of a random vector ξ = [ξ1 , ξ2 , · · · , ξm ]T ∈ Rm deﬁned by a pdf p(ξ) over the support Ω. Please
note that f(t, Θ, x) can be a nonlinear function in general. The PC expansion for the state vector x and uncertain
parameter Θ can be written as:
N

xi (t, Θ) =

xik (t)φk (ξ) = xTi (t)Φ(ξ) ⇒ x(t, ξ) = X pc (t)Φ(ξ)

(3)

θik φk (ξ) = ΘTi Φ(ξ) ⇒ Θ(t, ξ) = Θ pc Φ(ξ)

(4)

k=0
N

θi (ξ) =
k=0

where, X pc and Θ pc are matrices composed of coeﬃcients of PC expansion for state x and parameter Θ, respectively.
Similar to the linear case, coeﬃcients θik are obtained by making use of following normal equations:
θ ik =

θi (ξ), φk (ξ)
φk (ξ), φk (ξ)

(5)

Now, substitution of Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) into Eq. (2), leads to:
N

ei (X pc , ξ) =

x˙ik (t)φk (ξ) − fi (t, X pc (t)Φ(ξ), Θ pc Φ(ξ)),

i = 1, 2, · · · , n

(6)

k=0

n(N + 1) time-varying coeﬃcients xik can be obtained using the Galerkin process, i.e. projecting the error captured
in Eq. (6) onto space of basis functions φk (ξ). For polynomial or rational state nonlinearity, the Galerkin process
will lead to a set of n(N + 1) nonlinear deterministic diﬀerential equations. For non-polynomial nonlinearity such

1133

as transcendental or exponential functions, diﬃculties may arise during the computation of projection integrals. To
manage the non-polynomial nonlinearity diﬃculties in polynomial chaos integration, Dalbey et al. have proposed a
formulation [33] known as Polynomial Chaos Quadrature (PCQ). PCQ replaces the projection step of the PC with
numerical quadrature. The resulting method can be viewed as a MC-like evaluation of system equations, but with
sample points selected by quadrature rules. To illustrate this, consider Eq. (2), which by substitution of Eq. (3) and
Eq. (4) can be written as:
N

x˙ik (t)φk (ξ) − fi (t, X pc (t)Φ(ξ), Θ pc Φ(ξ)) = 0,

i = 1, · · · , n

(7)

k=0

The projection step of PC yields:
N

φk (ξ), φ j (ξ) x˙ik − fi (t, X pc (t)Φ(ξ), Θ pc Φ(ξ)), φ j (ξ) = 0

i = 1, · · · , n,

j = 0, · · · , N

(8)

k=0

In the case which f (t, x, Θ) is linear, it is possible to evaluate projection integrals of Eq. (8) analytically. More
generally, the starting point of PCQ methodology is to replace the exact integration with respect to ξ by numerical
integration. The familiar Gauss quadrature method is a suitable choice for most cases. This yields:
M

φi (ξ), φ j (ξ) =

φi (ξ)φ j (ξ)p(ξ)dξ

(10)

q=1

where M is the number of quadrature points used. Substitution of aforementioned approximation of stochastic integral

(14)

t0

Note that the integral expression in Eq. (14) can be evaluated by an integration of the model equation with a speciﬁc
instance of the random variable ξq . Thus the process of evaluating the statistics on the output of the system reduces to
sampling the chosen input points guided by quadrature method. Finally, the coeﬃcients of the PC expansion can be
obtained as:
M

fi (t, X pc (t)Φ(ξq ), Θ pc Φ(ξq )), dk2 =

(16)

Hence, the resulting method can be viewed as a MC-like evaluation of system equations, but with sample points
selected by quadrature rules. PCQ approximates the moment of system state as:

In other words, the output moments are approximated as a weighted sum of the output of simulations run at carefully
selected values of the uncertain input parameters (namely the quadrature points). The classic method of Gaussian
quadrature exactly integrates polynomials up to degree 2N + 1 with N + 1 quadrature points. The tensor product of
1–dimensional quadrature points is used to generate quadrature points in general n-dimension parameter space. As a
consequence, the number of quadrature points increases as (N + 1)n to integrate exactly an n-variate polynomial of
degree 2N + 1 as the number of input parameters increases.
PCQ can still suﬀer from underintegration error if an insuﬃcient number of samples is used. This necessitates an
adaptive or nested quadrature scheme to successively reﬁne the accuracy by increasing the number of sample points.
In a nested quadrature scheme, one can compare the solution computed at a given order with that of a quadrature
rule of lower order, which evaluates the integrand at a subset of the original N points, to minimize the integrand
evaluations. Gaussian quadrature rules are not naturally nested. Hence, we employ Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature
[34, 35] for numerical integration. The Clenshaw–Curtis scheme is based on an expansion of the integrand in terms
of Chebyshev polynomials and naturally leads to nested quadrature rules. Another advantage of Clenshaw–Curtis
quadrature is that the quadrature weights can be evaluated in order NlogN time by fast Fourier transform algorithms
as compared to order N 2 for the Gaussian quadrature weights.
4. Fusion of Measurement Data and Process Model
In the previous section, the PCQ approach is discussed in detail as a tool to propagate the state and parameter
uncertainty through a VATD model coupled with column eruption model. The use of sensor data to correct and
reﬁne the dynamical model forecast so as to reduce the associated uncertainty is a logical improvement over purely
model-based prediction. However, mathematical models for various sensors are generally based upon the “usefulness”
rather than the “truth” and do not provide all the information that one would like to know. Care must be taken when
assimilating the observational data. In this section, PCQ based minimum variance approach has been developed to
integrate multiple sources of complementary information with system dynamics to help reduce the uncertainty of the
output. The proposed approach make use of the PCQ methodology to evaluate the high ﬁdelity prediction between
two measurement intervals and updates the PC series expansion based upon minimum variance formulation.
Using the PCQ uncertainty evolution as a forecasting tool , the joint state and parameter pdf can be updated using
the Bayes’ rule on the arrival of a measurement data:
p(Θ, x|Yk ) =

p(Θ, x|Yk−1 )p(y(tk )|Θ, x)
p(y(tk ))

(19)

where Yk represents the measurement data up to time tk . p(Θ, x|Yk−1 ) is the joint prior pdf (solution of the PCQ
approach) of x and Θ at time tk given all observations up to time tk−1 , p(yk |Θ, x) is the likelihood that we observe
yk given x and Θ at time tk and p(Θ, x|Yk ) represents the joint posterior pdf of x and Θ at time tk given all previous
observations, including yk . Furthermore, p(yk ) is the total probability of observation at time tk which can be evaluated
as follows:
p(yk ) =
p(Θ, x|Yk−1 )p(yk |Θ, x)dΘdx
(20)

R. Madankan et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1129 – 1138

1135

As discussed in the previous section, the PCQ approach provides us a tool to determine equations of evolutions
for conditional moments for the prior joint pdf p(Θ, x|Yk−1 ). We now seek to develop equations of evolutions for
the posterior conditional moments. As a step towards this goal, let us consider a continuously diﬀerentiable scalar
function φ(Θ, x) and deﬁne posterior and prior conditional moments as:
φˆ +k = E+ [φ(Θ, x)]

φ(Θ, x)p(Θ, x|Yk )dΘdx

(21)

φˆ −k = E− [φ(Θ, x)]

φ(Θ, x)p(Θ, x|Yk−1 )dΘdx

(22)

Now, multiplying Eq. (19) with φ(Θ, x) and integrating over Θ and x, we get:
φˆ +k =

E− [φ(Θ, x)p(yk |Θ, x)]
p(yk )

(23)

Note that yk is ﬁxed with respect to the expectation operator and thus, the right-hand side of Eq. (23) is a function of
yk only. Notice that Eq. (23) is not an ordinary diﬀerence equation and the evaluation of right-hand side of Eq. (23)
requires the knowledge of the prior density function. Although the PCQ process does not provide us a closed-form
expression for the state or parameter pdf but it can be used eﬀectively in computing the expectation integrals. As
discussed in the previous section, all moments of random variables Θ and x are just function of their PC expansion
coeﬃcients, i.e., Θ pc and X pc . Hence, one can just update the PC coeﬃcients on the arrival of measurement data
based upon Eq. (23). So if we deﬁne Θ−pc and X−pc to be the prior PC coeﬃcients and Θ+pc and X+pc to be posterior PC
coeﬃcients, then we can evaluate φˆ − (Θ, x) and φˆ + (Θ, x) as:
φˆ −k = E− [φ(Θ, x)] =

φ(Θ−pc Φ(ξ), X−pc (t)Φ(ξ))p(ξ)dξ

(24)

φˆ +k = E+ [φ(Θ, x)] =

φ(Θ+pc Φ(ξ), X+pc (t)Φ(ξ))p(ξ)dξ

(25)

Hence, prior and posterior mean for both state and parameter can be written as:
zˆ −k

E− [zk ] =

X−pc1 (t)
Θ−pc1

zˆ +k

E+ [zk ] =

X+pc1 (t)

Similarly, prior and posterior covariance matrices can be written as:

where, X−pci and Θ−pci are the ith column of the PC expansion coeﬃcient matrices X−pc and Θ−pc , respectively. Similarly,
X+pci and Θ+pci are the ith column of unknown PC expansion coeﬃcient matrices X+pc and Θ+pc , respectively. According
to the minimum variance formulation, the posterior mean and covariance can be computed given an estimate of prior
mean and covariance [36]:

It should be noted that the minimum variance formulation is valid for any pdf although it makes use of only mean and
covariance information. y˜ k denotes the sensor output at time tk while function h(x, Θ) provides a true model between
sensor output y and states, x. Rk denotes the measurement noise error covariance matrix. Kk is known as the Kalman
gain matrix and matrices Σzy and Σzz are deﬁned as:

Notice that Eq. (27) and Eq. (30) provide a closed-form solution for X pc+1 and Θ+pc1 while one can solve for rest of the
posterior coeﬃcients while making use of Eq. (29) and Eq. (31).
5. Numerical Experiments
For validation purposes, we consider the Eyjafjallaj¨okulleruption scenario. The puff Lagrangian VATD model
was used to propagate ash parcels in a given wind ﬁeld (NCEP Reanalysis) [22] through time concentrating on
the period 14–16 April 2010. puff takes into account dry deposition by particle fallout, as well as dispersion and
advection.Variability in the height and loading of the eruption is introduced through the volcano column model bent.
Table 1 lists all source variables together with their assumed uncertainties. Output uncertainty due to uncertain input
parameters is determined with a polynomial chaos quadrature-based sampling of the multidimensional puﬀ input
vector space. Following runs of bent at the quadrature points, each bent output is then propagated through puff,
which was then run for a real-time period of two days. The outputs from puff were then combined to produce
the ensemble by applying the appropriate weight to each deterministic bent–puff run. For simulation purposes, a
random sample of source variable is used to create an artiﬁcial satellite imagery depicting ash top-height. The satellite
imagery data is assumed to be available every 6 hours during the two day simulation period.

For this set of simulations we compared the simulation outputs for 94 and 134 samples (quadrature points) and the
results indicate that 94 runs yields substantially the same results for mean and variance for ash top-height as 134 runs.
Similarly, the comparison of using 105 to 107 particles in the puff simulation also indicated that the choice of 4 × 106
particles was adequate for our purposes, and consistent with the ﬁndings of others [39].
Fig. 1 shows probability of ash being present at a given geological location along with synthetic satellite observed
ash top-height data for 16th April, 2010. As expected, the PCQ generated ash cloud footprint is quite large due to large
uncertainty in prior source parameters. It should be noticed that most of the satellite data lies with in high probability
region. We mention that 4th order PC expansion is used to computed these probability contours as discussed in
Ref. [33]. Fig. 2 show the estimated source parameters along with 3σ bounds while making use of the PCQ based
minimum variance estimator as discussed in Section 4. The solid red line represents the assumed true value for source
parameters while green squares corresponds to estimated source parameters. Furthermore, blue asterisks represent
±3σ bounds. From these ﬁgures, it is clear that the uncertainty associated with source parameters decreases as the
number of observations increases. These preliminary results clearly illustrates the eﬀectiveness of proposed ideas in
estimating the posterior distribution for source parameters.
