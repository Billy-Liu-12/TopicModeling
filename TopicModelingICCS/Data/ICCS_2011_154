Abstract
In this paper, a finite difference scheme is developed to solve the unsteady problem of combined heat and mass transfer from an
isothermal curved surface to a porous medium saturated by a non-Newtonian fluid. The curved surface is kept at constant
temperature and the power-law model is used to model the non-Newtonian fluid. The explicit finite difference method is used to
solve simultaneously the equations of momentum, energy and concentration. The consistency of the explicit scheme is examined
and the stability conditions are determined for each equation. Boundary layer and Boussinesq approximations have been
incorporated. Numerical calculations are carried out for the various parameters entering into the problem. Velocity, temperature
and concentration profiles are shown graphically. It is found that as time approaches infinity, the values of wall shear, heat
transfer coefficient and concentration gradient at the wall, which are entered in tables, approach the steady state values.

Keywords: Finite difference method; stability; power-law fluids; porous medium; mass transfer; free convection

1. Introduction
The study of physics of the flow through porous media has many applications, such as geothermal fields, soil
pollution, fibrous insulation and nuclear-waste disposal. Also, a number of industrially important fluids such as
molten plastics, polymers, pulps, foods and slurries display non-Newtonian fluid behavior. Non-Newtonian fluids
exhibit a non-linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate. Chen and Chen [1] presented similarity
solutions for free convection of non-Newtonian fluids over vertical surfaces in porous media. The problem of
buoyancy induced flow of non-Newtonian fluids over a non-isothermal horizontal plate embedded in a porous
medium was studied by Mehta and Rao [2] by introducing a general similarity transformation procedure. DarcyForchheimer natural, forced and mixed convection heat transfer in power-law fluid saturated porous media was

studied by Shenoy [3]. Nakayama and Koyama [4] studied the natural convection over a non-isothermal body of
arbitrary shape embedded in a porous medium. All these studies were concerned with steady flows. Unsteady
natural heat transfer from a curved surface to a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic liquid is investigated by Roy [5]. Haq
and Mulligan [6] studied the problem of transient free convection from a vertical plate to a non-Newtonian fluid in a
porous medium. Unsteady free convection flow of a non-Newtonian fluid through a porous medium bounded by a
vertical surface was investigated by Hady et al. [7]. Natural convection flows due to combined buoyancy effects of
thermal and species diffusion in a fluid saturated porous medium have many applications. Unsteady free convective
flow and mass transfer through a porous medium bounded by an infinite vertical limiting surface with constant
suction and time-dependent temperature studied by Raptis [8]. Kumari and Nath [9] studied the unsteady laminar
natural convection of an electrically conducting fluid over two-dimensional and axisymmetric bodies in a porous
medium with an applied magnetic field. Unsteady mixed convection adjacent to a vertical surface with combined
buoyancies in the presence of magnetic field was numerically studied by the same authors [10]. Unsteady magnetohydrodynamic mixed convection with combined buoyancies over a horizontal cylinder and a sphere was also
reported [11]. Pop and Herwing [12] studied the transient development of the concentration boundary layer with
impulsive mass diffusion from a heated vertical surface. The problem of unsteady free convection adjacent to an
impulsively heated horizontal circular cylinder in porous media was investigated by Bradean et al. [13]. Numerical
study of double-diffusive free convection from a vertical surface is presented by Srinivasan and Angirasa [14]. More
recently, Angirasa et al. [15] investigated combined heat and mass transfer by natural convection with opposing
buoyancy effects in a fluid saturated porous medium. Rastogi and Poulikakos [16] considered non-Newtonian fluid
saturated porous media and presented similarity solutions for aiding flows with concentration. The problem of
forced convection heat transfer on a flat plate embedded in porous media for power-law fluids has been studied by
Hady and Ibrahim [17].
The purpose of this paper is to study the problem of unsteady combined heat and mass transfer by natural
convection from an isothermal curved surface which is kept at constant temperature to a non-Newtonian power-law
fluid saturated porous medium. The dimensionless non-linear partial differential equations are solved numerically
using an explicit finite-difference scheme. The values of wall shear, heat transfer coefficient and concentration
gradient at the wall are determined for steady and unsteady free convection.
2. Mathematical Formulation
The physical configuration and the coordinate system used in the current investigation are shown in Fig. 1. An
isothermal curved surface at constant temperature is embedded in a non-Newtonian power-law fluid saturated
porous medium. In this study, in accordance with previous work reported by Shulman et al. [18] and Shvets and
Vishnevskeiy [19] the following transport properties based on the power-law model are assumed to hold.

where W ij and eij are the tensors of stress and strain rate, k is the non-Newtonian consistency index, G ij is the unit
tensor, I2 is the second invariant of the strain rate, p is the pressure and n is the power flow behavior index of the
fluid (n>0). For n=1, it reduces to a Newtonian fluid, for values of n<1 the behavior is pseudoplastic and, when n>1,
the fluid is dilatant.
Under the Boussinesq, boundary layer and dilute solution approximations, the governing mass, momentum,
energy and species conservation equations for free convective flows driven by temperature and concentration

In these equations, u and v are the velocity components along x and y axes. The temperature of the surface is
Tw and the surface concentration of the diffusing species is C w . Far away from the surface these values are invariant
and are represented by T and C , respectively. U , D , D, E , E *, H , F , K , Z and g are the density, the thermal
diffusivity, the species diffusion coefficient, the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion, the volumetric
coefficient expansion with concentration, the porosity, the empirical constant, the permeability, angle is shown in
Fig. 1 and acceleration due to gravity, respectively. The boundary and initial conditions are,

3. An Explicit Finite Difference Scheme
The solution of a set of simultaneous nonlinear partial differential equations by the explicit finite-difference
method was given by Carnahan et al. [20]. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations (8)-(11), with initial
and boundary conditions (12), were solved for the dependent variables u, v, T and C as functions of x, y and t. The
steady state condition was assumed to exist when wu / wt , wT / wt and wC / wt approached zero in the unsteady state
problem, formulated in the previous section. Successive steps in time can then be regarded as successive

approximations toward the steady state solution. The spatial domain under investigation was restricted to finite
dimensions. Here, the length of the plate Xmax was assumed to be 50 and the boundary layer thickness Ymax was taken
as 20.
Consider u c, v c , T c and C c denote the values of u, v, T and C at the end of a time-step. Then, the approximate
set of finite difference equations corresponding to the system of (8)-(11) are,

any one time-step, for the values of n, 0.5 d n d 2 . Then, at the end of any time-step 't , the new velocity
components u c and v c, the new temperature T c and the new concentration C c at all interior grid points may be
obtained by successive applications of (21), (22), (20) and (19), respectively. This process is repeated in time and
provided the time-step is sufficiently small, u, v, T and C should eventually converge to values, which approximate
the steady state solution of Eqs. (19)-(22).
The velocity, temperature fields and concentration distributions were calculated for various time steps for a
100u 60 grid. A comprehensive set of results have been obtained covering the ranges 0.5 d n d 2.0 , 1 d Re Pr d 10 ,
0.5 d Re Sc d 10 , 0.0 d Gr d 1.0 , 0.0 d Gm d 1.0 , 0.05 d k1 d 0.5 , and 0.05 d k 2 d 0.5 . A selection of these
results is presented here with a view to isolate the effect of each individual parameter. An examination of complete
results for t=10, 20,..., 70, revealed little or no change in u, v, T and C after t=70 for all computations. Thus the
results for t=70 are essentially the steady-state values.
4. Consistency of the Scheme
When, the finite difference procedure approximate the solution of the partial differential equation under study
and not the solution of any other partial differential equation, then, the procedure is called have consistency. The
consistency is measured in terms of the difference between a differential equation and difference equation.

From equations (23)-(25) we note that, the R.H.S. represents the truncation error which is tends to zero as
't , 'x, 'y o 0 . Therefore, the explicit scheme is consistent.

5. Stability Conditions of the Scheme
Here, the stability conditions of the finite difference scheme are determined. As an explicit procedure is used we
intent to investigate the largest time-step consistent with the stability. Because, t does not appear in the continuity
equation, it will be ignored. At an arbitrary time t 1, the general terms of the Fourier expansion for u, T and C are
become e i '( ax  by ) , i '
 1. At a later time t, these terms will become u \ (t )e i '( ax by ) , T ] (t )e i '( ax by ) ,
i '( ax  by )

Substituting in (20)-(22) and regarding the coefficients u and v as constants over any one time-step and denoting
the values of \ , ] and I after the time-step by \ c , ] c and I c , we obtain,

In order to seek the stability of the previous system, the moduli of each of the eigenvalues O1 , O 2 and O3 of the
coefficients matrix should be less than or equal to unity. Here, we have O1 A , O 2 B and O3 E . Therefore, the
stability conditions are A d 1 , B d 1 and E d 1 , for all a and b.
Since, the heated fluid rises in the positive x-direction, u may be assumed everywhere non-negative. Also, we
assume that v to be everywhere non-positive, because, the fluid is drawn in from the positive y-direction to take its

Numerical results of transient friction factor, Nusselt number and Sherwood number for different values of the
power-law index n are presented in Tab. 1. From this table we note that both the wall shear stress and the mass
transfer rate is reduced with n, while they are enhanced with time. Also, it can be seen that, the heat transfer rate
increases with n and t when n d 1 , and the opposite is true when n t 1 . Tab. 2 indicates that, an increase in the
values of the parameters k1 and k2 reduces the wall shear stress, the heat transfer rate and the concentration gradient
at the wall. From Tab. 3 it can be seen that due to an increase in RePr there is a fall in the wall shear stress and the
concentration gradient at the wall, but, there is an increase in the heat transfer rate. Also, from the same table we
note that as ReSc increases both the wall shear stress and the heat transfer rate decreases, while, the concentration
gradient at the wall increases. It is obvious that, an increase in the values of the parameters Gr and Gm enhances the
wall shear stress, the heat transfer rate and the concentration gradient at the wall, as shown in Tab. 4.

Figs. 2-3 illustrate the velocity function for different values of the parameters t, k1, k2, RePr, ReSc, Gr and Gm.
The effects of k1 and k2 on the velocity profiles are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that as the parameters k1 and k2
increase, the velocity maximum decreases. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that as the parameters RePr and ReSc increase,

the velocity maximum decreases. It is interesting to note that the two lines (RePr=10, ReSc=5) and (RePr=5,
ReSc=10) are coincided when Gr equal Gm.

Fig. 7. Steady state concentration for various values of RePr and
ReSc when n=1.5, k1=0.05, k2=0.02, Gr=Gm=0.5 at X=20.

Figs. 4-5 show the temperature profiles for different values of the governing parameters. It is clear from Fig. 4
that as parameters k1 and k2 are increasing the temperature profiles are increasing. Also, we observe from Fig. 5 that
due to an increase in RePr there is reduce in the thermal boundary layer thickness and a fall in the temperature
profiles, while, with ReSc the opposite is true.
Figs. 6-7 illustrate the concentration distributions for various values of the given parameters. It is clear that as the
parameters k1 and k2 are increasing the concentration profiles are increasing as shown in Fig. 6. We note from Fig. 7
that due to an increase in RePr there is an increase in the concentration profiles, while, with ReSc the opposite is
true.
