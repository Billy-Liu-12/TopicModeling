Abstract. The present computational era has witnessed the evolution of the
field of computational biology into two somewhat disjoint communities: one
group focused on the “wriggling of molecules” (e.g. molecular dynamics) and
another focused on pattern matching and informatics (e.g. sequence alignment).
The separation starts relatively early in the training of the community, as is
evident from the relative weighting of calculus vs. computer science courses in
the curriculum of undergraduate majors in the various disciplines of
computational biology. But at the dawn of the petascale era in computational
science, exciting advances in healthcare can be envisioned at a new niche in the
computational biology ecosystem – a niche formed by the reunion of the
separated branches of computational biology. We consider some illustrative
examples from pharmaceutical informatics of data-intensive informatics
approaches applied to “objects” that are not simply numbers or static molecular
structures but instead are (CPU-intensive) molecular simulations. These results
suggest a promising pathway for applying petascale informatics to shift the
paradigm in pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D to a future world of
personalized medicines. The early examples from pharmaceutical informatics
also indicate that the foundational framework will be based on the concept of
Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS).
