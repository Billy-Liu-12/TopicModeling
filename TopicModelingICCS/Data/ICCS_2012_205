Abstract
After the reform of urban housing system in 1998, China real estate market had a rapid growth in recent years, while house price
was increasing sharply. Using the House Price Indices of 70 cities in China from CREIS (China Real Estate Index System), we
found that the house price of each city had an upward tendency with some certain stages. However, different cities also had their
distinctive features. In this paper, a new integrated method for time series clustering is employed to do cluster analysis on city
real estate market of China. The time series are firstly divided into several stages mainly based on the changes in government
policy using wavelet analysis with expert experience. Then the variables that describe the character of each stage such as average
growth rate and volatility are used as attributes of each city. Consequently, DBScan algorism for normal clustering can be used
and the results show that there are several categories of growth modes of city real estate markets while the macro-control policies
had different effect on each category.

Keywords: Real estate market; Price index; Time series clustering; Wavelet analysis; DBScan

1. Introduction
China real estate market had a rapid development in recent years after the reform of urban housing system in
1998. Through the marketization of real estate market, it becomes one of the most important pillar industries of
China, and makes great contributes to the economic growth in long-run [1]. In the end of 2010, the investment in
real estate market development was over 4825.94 billion, almost 18 times against that of 1999; meanwhile, the sales
of commercial houses reached 527.21 billion RMB, which raised an increase of 1600% compared with 1999.
However, with the high speed development of real estate market, the house price was also increasing quickly in
these years, especially after 2005. The commercial houses average price increased from 2053 RMB/m2 in 1999 to
5032 RMB/m2 in 2010 and the house prices in some big cities were going up much faster than average. Take the
tourism city Sanya for an example, the house price had a sharp rise in the end of 2009 and the growth rate of
commercial houses average price was almost ten times against the national average. Besides the easy monetary
policy which promoted the national real estate market, the rapid increase of house price in Sanya was mainly

influenced by investment demand caused by the international tourism island strategy of Hainan province [2]. The
house price trend of Haikou which is also a tourism city in Hainan province was almost the same as Sanya. However,
the house prices of some third class cities kept steady growth in the same period. Further, the real estate markets of
different cities also had various reactions to government regulatory policies. In Apr. 2010, ten policies of national
real estate market were issued to control the excessive growth of house price, which usually called "National Ten"
including differentiated housing consumer credit policy [3]. The "National Ten" had some impact on curbing house
price increase in some big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen in a certain degree. However, it had little
influence on second-tier cities like Dalian, Jinan, Jilin and so on. Instead, the restrictions in big cities promoted the
house price increase in small cities [4].
In order to better understand the differentiation development of various cities and make more efficient macrocontrol policies that directed to a certain category of cities, it is necessary to analysis the features of house price
trends in different cities and find their generality as well as specific features. In this way, the cities can be separated
into several certain groups and each group may have some significant features like having similar reactions to an
particular event. It will also provide support in decision-making of the government diversity control policies.
2. Literatures Review
Bourassa et al. developed a statistical method for defining housing submarkets using household survey data. The
weighted mean squared errors from hedonic equations were used to classify the submarkets and they found the Kmeans clustering procedure had a better performance than other methods [5]. Watkins used data from Glasgow
housing market and suggested that submarket are important and determined by both spatial and structural factors
rather than similarity of property characteristics [6]. Kauko et al. Employed neural network model to examine the
housing market of Helsinki, Finland and the results showed that the submarket formation depended on two factors:
relative location and house type [7]. Bourassa et al. maintain that the appropriate definition of submarket depended
on the use to which they will be put, and the submarkets should be defined so that the accuracy of hedonic
predictions will be optimized [8]. Hepsen and Vatansever used several hierarchical clustering algorithms to study
the residential market in Turkey and found there were three-cluster partitions of districts that revealed a clear rental
return distinction [9]. Most of previous literatures focused on the submarket of one big city and the clustering or
classification was based mainly on the location information, few papers studied grouping of city real estate market
in a national wide view. In China, there are also few literatures that studied the differentiation of city real estate
markets. Huang based on the real estate industry investment and development indicators and found there were 5
types of real estate economy in China [10]. Peng and Hu used several real estate market indicators like investment,
related employed persons, sales areas, enterprises profit and so on of over 30 provinces from 1999 to 2003, and did
cluster analysis for each year separately [11]. There are also some other literatures in China that using the industry
indicators to do normal clustering but not based on the house price itself.
In order to separate the real estate markets of different cities into some certain groups based on the house price
series, the cluster analysis must be employed. The goal of clustering is to identify structure in an unlabeled data set
by objectively organizing data into homogeneous groups where the within-group-object similarity is minimized and
between-group-object dissimilarity is maximized [12]. Various algorithms have been developed to cluster different
types of data sets. However, not like the normal clustering, the data of house price is time series data which is an
important part of temporal data mining that widely used in business intelligence area [13,14]. The time series data
must be converted in to the form of static data so that the algorithms for clustering static data can be directly used.
Liao proposed that there are three time series clustering approaches: raw-data-based, feature-based and model based
[12]. Previous researches have done numerous works on clustering algorithms [15,16], but few studies on mining
the enough features of series itself besides average growth rate as well as how to convert the time series into normal
data, while it's also hard to find a suitable model for all the series [17]. Furthermore, there is no study inducing the
expert experience to time series clustering which is an important factor that had already used in some data mining
area [18].
In this paper, a new integrated method for time series clustering is employed to do cluster analysis on city real
estate market of China, and it will be briefly introduced in the next section. In Section 4, the empirical analysis is
proposed and the clustering results are presented. Finally, the conclusions make up Section 5.

3. A New Integrated Method for Time Series Clustering
As there are lots of relatively effective and perfect clustering algorithms, we concentrated on how to inducing
the expert experience information into our time series mining and integrating the normal clustering algorithms with
turning points detection method based on expert experience or event mining. There are three steps
Step 1: Detect all the turning points tij for each time series and the average series using wavelet analysis [19]. tij is
the jth turning point for series i; and for the average series i=a.
Step 2: Based on the results of Step 1 for the average series, find several real turning points T1, T2,...,Tk that can
correspond to some big events using expert experiences, so that there are k+1 stages;
Step 3: Scan the turning points from Step 1 of each series, discard the points that far from T1, T2,...,Tk and keep
only k points Tij like the average series.
Step 4: In each stage, calculate the average growth rate and standard deviation. And for each series, figure out the
departures from turning points Tij to the corresponding Tj. So that, there will be 2(k+1)+k=3k+2 attributes of the
time series.
Step 5: Use DBScan algorithm [20] with the attributes calculated in Step 4 for clustering.
The technology roadmap is shown in Fig 1.

In Step 1, we employed singularity detection based on wavelet analysis to find the turning points of each series
including the average one. Suppose the input is an one dimensional signal {f(n)}, the expected output should be the
locations and types of singularity points. First, one of wavelets is chosen to do decomposition, as well as the number
of decomposition levels J and threshold T are set based on the raw signal; then, the binary system wavelet transform
WJf(t), t is the parameter denoting
are proposed on the singularity {f(n)} to get wavelet coefficients W1f(t), W2f(t),
locations; next, threshold processing is applied and we can find the maximum module points by certain constraints;
finally, through the test of local maximum value, we can get the singularity points. In Step 5, some clustering
algorithms are proposed. In this paper, we use DBScan algorithm [21] to do cluster analysis on the attributes we get
from step 4. DBScan is an density-based method that the density (number of objects or data points) in the
neighborhood exceeds some threshold.
4. Empirical Analysis on City Real Estate Market
4.1. Data description
In this paper, we use the House Price Indices (HPIs) of 70 cities in China from CREIS (China Real Estate Index
System) as indicators of house prices in different cities. The HPIs are constructed using hedonic model including
both year-on-year and chain index, and published by China's National Bureau of Statistics (CNBS). In order to show
the trend more intuitively, we firstly transform the chain index to fixed base index and use the beginning time of the
statistical data Jun. 2005 as base year with the index equal to 100. Because the statistical coverage of HPIs changed
in the end of 2010, we use the data from Jun. 2005 to Oct. 2010. As data missing of Yangzhou in Jiansu province,
there are only 69 cities are chosen as our samples. Otherwise, we use the national average HPI published by CNBS
as average series instead of the calculated one. As shown in Fig. 2, we can see the fixed base HPIs of the national
average as well as the two tourism cities Sanya and Haikou we just mentioned in Section 1.As there are 70 series
including the average one, it s hard to show all of them in a single figure.

Fig. 2. Some samples of the fixed base HPIs

4.2. Development stages of China real estate market
The wavelet decomposition and singularity detection are first proposed to get the raw turning points of each real
estate market. We take decomposition levels J=4 and find that the singularity points in the third level is most
efficient. The horizontal axis k in each input signal denotes the location of the point. In our study, it is time point.
When the location t=0, it means in Jun. 2005, while t=65 represents Oct. 2010. We can see that there are significant

singularity points at t=15, 30, 44, 55, 60 corresponding to Aug. 2006, Nev. 2007, Jan. 2009, Dec. 2009 and May
2010. Based on the event mining from related literatures [21] and expert interview, we found these points happen to
be time of policies changes. Table 1.shows the final turning points we used integrated the singularity detection and
expert experience as well as the big event happened around these periods. Consequently, we get 6 sub-stages of the
whole period. See the national average HPI in Fig. 3, the trends of house prices in different stages have various
features. As mentioned in Section 1, house prices in different cities had various reactions to one certain event. Take
Tianjin and Wuhan for examples, as shown in Fig. 3, HPIs of Tianjin and Wuhan seem similar to the national
average in the most stages. However, in stage IV, house price of Tianjin was increasing rapidly almost the same as
the national average due to economic stimulus plan, while the relaxation of monetary policy made little impact on
the house price of Wuhan. In order to better describe the various features of different stages, indicators representing
the trends in each stage are used as attributes to do the cluster analysis. Consequently, the average growth rates,
standard deviations of each stages, as well as departures from the turning points in every series to that of the average
one are calculated as attributes of cluster analysis. So far, there are 17 attributes of our sample.

Based on DBScan algorithm, the cluster analysis is proposed using a machine learning software called WEKA
[22]. The results are shown in Table 2. The 69 cities are clustered into 6 groups while 5 cities are un-clustered
including Beijing and Shanghai. In order to see house price trend of each group more clearly, the average indices of

Fig. 4. (a) average indices of 6 city groups; (b) HPIs of 5 un-clustered cities

We can see that each group or un-clustered city has its own features. (1) Cities in group 1 and group 2 are less
affected by macro-control policies and have a steady increase after the end of 2007. However, the growth rate of
house price in group 2 is much smaller. Further, these two groups cover half of our sample cities, that is to say, there
are 48 cities had a steady development in their real estate market, both good news and bad news from the
government made little impact on house prices. (2) There are only two cities we mentioned before in group 3, Sanya
and Haikou. As we explained previously, the house price had a sharp increase in the end of 2009. Meanwhile, the
control policies in last two stages starting from Dec. 2009 effectively curbed the high price rise. (3) Cities in group 4
have asymmetric reactions to the control policies while having a more sensitive and continuous reaction to
promotion policies, but few reactions to restraint policy. (4) Group 5 and 6 both have reactions to the government
policies while cities in group 5 including Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Xiamen reacted more violently than that of
group 6. (6) The un-clustered cities all had their own developing tracks due to some specific local policies or certain
economic reasons. Finally, the classification almost has no relation with the geographic information.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we developed a new method for time series clustering. Based on integration of wavelet analysis and
event mining with expert experience, 6 stages in China real estate market are found during Jun. 2005 to Oct. 2010.
Then the indicators representing features in different stages and location of turning points are used as attributes for
DBScan cluster analysis. The results show that the 69 sample cities can be classified into 6 groups while 5 cities are
un-clustered. From the average trend of house price in each group, the differentiation of city real estate markets can
be found. So one important suggestion proposed here is that the macro-control policies must be more pertinences to
different cities.
