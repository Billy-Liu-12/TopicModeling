a tested in-house immersed-boundary implementation [3, 4], where we demonstrated that the
simulation can be scaled up to 106 cells executing on 8192 cores without significant loss of
parallel efficiency. The implementation itself is designed to be very flexible and applicable in
various scenarios. In the following we discuss how we have further improved the computational
performance of Hemocell by separating the time-scale of the material model integration from
that of the fluid dynamics and by pre-computing a randomised dense packing of red blood cells
to provide improved initial conditions.

Methods

Initial conditions for cellular flows are usually not trivial. An uniform packing of cells can be
easily calculated using their bounding-boxes as a basis for packing space requirement. RBCs,
however, have a unique biconcave shape that fills the bounding box with a low volume ratio.
The usually applied term that describes the surface [5, 6] is as follows:



x2 + z 2
x2 + z 2
(x2 + z 2 )2
y =R 1−
+ c2
c0 + c1
,
R2
R2
R4
where (R, c0 , c1 , c2 ) = (3.91µm, 0.1358, 1.001, −0.5614). If we aim to fill a rectangular domain
with rectangular bounding boxes, in fortuitous cases the volume fill ratio ( ΦBB ) might go
up to a 100%. On the level of RBCs within the bounding boxes, this yields ΦRBC ≈ 32%
which might be far from the desired value since physiologic blood has a hematocrit (ΦRBC )
of approximately 45%. If non-rectangular domains are considered, e.g. in the case of flows
in smaller vessels, this ratio might fall even lower. In our approach, we present a possible
solution using a kinematic simulation of encompassing ellipsoids to effectively generate dense
cell distributions with random positions and alignments. The diameters of the ellipsoid for
the RBCs are (Dx , Dy , Dx ) = (2.5µm, 1.2µm, 2.5µm). The overlap of the RBC shape and the
encompassing ellipsoid is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Left: 3D view of enclosing ellipsoid (yellow) overlayed on an RBC (red). Right:
cut-plane visualising the volume fill ratios using the same colours for the contours.
Naturally, the enclosing ellipsoid has a larger volume than the RBC itself, therefore the
above mentioned optimal rectangular bounding-box packing in case of ΦBB = 100% translates

to an ellipsoid volume ratio of ΦEll = 53% (with the corresponding RBC volume ratio of
ΦRBC = 32%). We can improve the situation by calculating the packing of ellipsoids instead
of bounding boxes. The optimal dense packing of ellipsoidal shapes is not known, nevertheless,
several recent studies[7, 8] imply that the highest achievable ratio for ellipsoids of the diameters
used here should be around ΦEll = 80%, which in turn would represent ΦRBC = 49%. This
value is high enough for physiological blood-like suspensions.
For this computation, a simple kinetic model of hard ellipsoid dense packing, called the
force-bias model [9, 10, 11], was implemented. It distributes the locations randomly and then
defines two radii scaling for every cell type (e.g. RBC, platelet): din represents the possible
largest radius in the system without any overlap and dout is initially set so that the merged
volume of all the ellipsoids scaled with it yields the required volume ratio. Then we apply a
repulsive force between overlapping ellipsoids proportional to the volume of the overlapping
regions:
rj − ri
,
Fij = δij pij
|rj − ri |
where δij equals 1 if there is an overlap between particle i and j and 0 otherwise, while pij is a
potential function. The positions are updated following the Newtonian mechanics where mass
is proportional to the particle scaling radius. This ensures that larger particles will move slower
than smaller ones. The potential function was selected to be proportional to the overlapping
volume of the dout scaled particles. As a final step the size of dout is reduced every iteration
according to a chosen τ contraction rate. The computation stops when dout ≤ din . Using this
method, we were able to push up to ΦEll = 76%, which yields the required ΦRBC = 46% for
the RBCs.
Additionally, we can integrate the particle motions by only allowing translation of their
centre of mass, thus predefining the alignment of the particles. This might be beneficial for
higher velocity flows where the cells are expected to be lined up with the streamlines. Figure
2 presents two sample initial conditions generated with this method.

rotations with the hematocrit of 30% and 35%, respectively. The red coloured ellipsoids are the
encompassing ellipsoids of the RBCs and the yellow coloured ones are for the platelets. Left:
randomly distributed positions with fixed alignments. Right: both positions and alignments
are randomly distributed. Please note: high volume-fill ratios ( > 40% ) are difficult to achieve
if alignments are fixed.

Another issue for our framework is the computational cost which is steeply increased by the
application of the lattice Boltzmann method. LBM is a highly parallel and computationally
efficient method known to work accurately in vascular geometries [2, 12, 13]. However, it is an
explicit method which translates to very small time-steps for microfluid flows, usually in the
order of 10−8 s. The usual physiologically relevant time-range scales from 0.1s to several seconds
which translates to several millions of required iterations. Naturally, this does not pose any
serious computational challenge for resolving the Newtonian and non-turbulent plasma flow.
The material model of the cellular membranes on the other hand is rather demanding in this
regard and it constitutes over 95% of the total computational time [14]. In our implementation it
can rely on either Euler or Adams-Bashforth integration schemes. Even though these are explicit
schemes as well, this model performs accurately with up to two orders of magnitude larger
time-steps than the LBM used for plasma flow computation. For this reason, the integration
time-steps of the background CFD simulation are decoupled from the membrane material model
integration using a simple adaptivity rule: the largest appearing force of the material system
is probed at every time-step. When it is below a certain threshold, the integration step size is
increased up to a limit, while if it surpasses a maximal value, we decrease its size gradually.
This threshold is fine-tuned for each geometry to ensure a balance between performance and
numerical stability. The separation of time-steps introduces an additional small numerical error
to the system. Its effect was investigated by comparing the cellular positions and velocities after
105 iterations in the case of a straight vessel segment with the separation ratios of 1 : 1 and
1 : 100. The difference is negligible (below 1%).

Results

In the current section we demonstrate the applicability of the ideas described above by a use-case
of a small vessel flow with high hematocrit. It is a periodic flow driven by external body force.
The average flow velocity is 5mm/s. The spatial resolution is 0.5µm and the LBM time-step size
is δLBM = 5 × 10−8 s. For cellular flows starting from uniform initial particle distribution, we
employ the common convention of requiring a particle with average flow velocity to circulate
the geometry ten times before the actual simulation takes place. This is to ensure that the
system does not contain any artificial transients. Since the geometry is l = 256µm long, this
translates to approximately 10 million iterations for warm-up. For domains with randomised
initial positions we found that approximately one full cycle results in a similar cell distribution.
Hence, our random high-hematocrit initial condition results in a very substantial factor 10
reduction in warm-up time. For measuring transport properties we consider a 0.1s time range
after the warm-up. One state of this flow system initialised by our method is visualised in Fig.
3.
Depending on the actual case at hand (mostly on the geometry and on the hematocrit), the
material model might take up more than 95% of the computational time. The reason for it is
the high computational cost of the constitutive model per membrane node relative to the computational cost of a fluid node. Therefore, decoupling the two integration time-steps can yield
a significant increase in computational efficiency. Furthermore, a dense system can be sensitive
to spontaneous cluster formations which might lead to increased temporary deformation of the
cells. Thus, managing the time-step size adaptively becomes similarly important.
Figure 4 shows the appearing largest forces in lattice units during a typical computation
of a cellular flow inside the small vessel. The small peaks in the graph usually denote cell-cell
collisions and smaller cluster-formation events, while the large peak around 800k iterations
corresponds to a momentary large structure formation, where a dense cluster appears close to

the edge of the flow and presses some cells against the wall. This event is associated with higher
levels of deformation, thus with larger corresponding forces. In this case, a smaller iteration stepsize is necessary for the integration of the constitutive equations to retain numerical stability.
As the force peak progresses above the limit of 0.001lN , the integrations steps are set to a
smaller value. The typical bounds for the material model integration steps in our simulations
is δtmaterial ∈ [1; 100] × δtLBM .
The overview of the computational time requirements for this high-hematocrit vessel flow
case is shown in Table 1. These computations were carried out in the strong scaling limit,
where further subdivision of the domain is not possible. The timings are based on performance
results obtained using 12-core Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 CPUs. The total computational times are
denoted as expected total time since the first two configurations were not fully executed. These
total time values are computed from the average iteration time of the first 5 × 105 iterations
and the total number of required iterations.

Overall the joint application of these two techniques for the current vessel flow case results
in a substantial decrease of the total computation time. The randomised initialisation saves
the majority of the warm-up cycles, while the adaptivity allow for stable time-step ratios up
to 1 : 100 bringing the computational time down from more than 300 days to around 2 days in
the investigated case.

Conclusions

Hemocell, a cellular biofluid flow simulation library, is capable of computing the flow of bloodlike suspensions accurately. The presented methods extend the range of its applicability to vessel
diameters of above 100µm, as well as to simulated time-scales in the range of a few seconds.
These scales reach into the domain of macroscopic flows. Therefore, with the application
of this framework it is possible to close the gap between the cellular and the macroscopic
scales for several flow types of biological relevance, such as flows around micro-medical devices,
investigations of margination, cell trafficking, and thrombus formation.
