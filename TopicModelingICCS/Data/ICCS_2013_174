Abstract
Using the ﬁve-dimensional gyrokinetic equations for simulations of hot fusion plasmas requires discretizations with a lot
degrees of freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. The sparse grid combination technique could be one remedy to this
problem, since it is dividing the original problem into smaller subproblems, which can be solved independently. For this study,
the gyrokinetic code GENE has been used for solving the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem using the combination technique.
The performance of diﬀerent combination schemes is used on a test problem and evaluated with respect to accuracy in retrieving
an eigenvalue and the computational eﬀort required. This evaluation suggests, that the sparse grid combination technique is a
feasible method to compute eigenvalues of the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem.
Keywords: sparse grids; gyrokinetics; eigenvalues

1. Introduction
The simulation of hot magnetized fusion plasmas via the ﬁve-dimensional gyrokinetic equations is used to
understand the transport phenomena in modern plasma conﬁnement devices such as tokamaks and stellarators. A
gyrokinetic code being widely used in the fusion community is GENE [1], a highly parallelized Eulerian simulation code being developed in the group of Frank Jenko at the IPP in Garching, Germany. GENE is resolving the
small scale microturbulence in magnetized plasmas, which is one of the main components of the so-called anomalous transport in current conﬁnement devices. This turbulence happens on larger time-scales than the rotation of
the charged plasma particles around the magnetic ﬁeld lines (gyration), whereas the length-scale of the turbulence
is on par with the gyration. In gyrokinetics the resolution of the gyration in time is dropped so that the development of turbulence in time can be directly observed. But even with its mature parallelization performance [2, 3],
GENE is facing scalability problems due to the curse of dimensionality, since even moderate resolutions in each
dimension lead to tremendous numbers of degrees of freedom in the simulations.
One remedy to that could be the application of sparse grids [4], since they reduce the amount of degrees of
freedom used to retrieve a solution. But unfortunately they cannot be applied directly onto GENE, since they
would require a reimplementation of the data structures and operators in GENE, which is far from being feasible.
Thus the sparse grid combination technique [5] is applied in this paper. A sparse grid approximation is obtained

from there by an appropriate combination of regular full grid approximations of reduced resolution and thus
reduced grid size. These can be determined completely in parallel so that the combination technique can be used
as an additional level of parallelism [6] and might be even a remedy in dealing with faults [7]. The combination
technique has been successfully applied to the approximation of turbulent ﬂow before [8] and has a large ﬂexibility
in adapting to the underlying problem to solve [9, 10].
In this paper we present the performance of the combination technique in retrieving approximations of the
eigenvalues of the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem in GENE [11, 12]. These eigenvalues give the growth rate of
the microinstabilities leading to the microturbulence and thus the anomalous transport. They are used in quasilinear transport analysis and for large scale parameter scans, identifying suitable parameter regimes for nonlinear
simulations. The eigenvalue computation would heavily proﬁt from reducing the computation time by a further
parallelization of the computation by the second level of parallelism introduced by the combination technique.
The computation of eigenmodes in a realistic, medium-size tokamak domain (i.e. global simulation [2]) was so
far not achievable, but might be using the combination technique.
2. Gyrokinetics
The gyrokinetic equations are describing the time-development of a distribution function in a ﬁve-dimensional
space. They are derived from the six-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell equations
∂g s

which are basically coupling the Boltzmann equation with the Maxwell equations. It describes the distribution
function g s , which can be normalized to give the probability of ﬁnding a particle of species s (e.g. deuterium,
electron) at a certain position in phase space spanned by x and v. The Vlasov equations describe the transport of
g s due to electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B and the collision of the particles with other particles by Δ(g s ). The ﬁelds
E(g s ) and B(g s ) are computed using Maxwells equations
∇E = 4πρ

∇B = 0

∇×B=

for which the density of charge ρ and the current density j have to be computed by moments of the distribution
function g s in velocity space
ρ(x) = q s

g s (x, v)dv

j(x) = q s

vg s (x, v)dv .

(3)

Due to this mutual dependence of the ﬁelds and the distribution function the Vlasov equations (1) are actually
non-linear. Using the Vlasov equation for simulating the hot magnetized plasma in a tokamak would require huge
computational resources, since rather small and less important time-scales are resolved. In a magnetic ﬁeld the
charged particles are revolving around the magnetic ﬁeld lines due to the Lorentz force (gyration), whereas they
can move freely parallel to it. Using the Vlasov equations, the fast gyration is resolved in time, whereas the slow
particle drifts described by the movement of the center of rotation are slow and thus on a larger time-scale. But
exactly these drifts are driving the microturbulence and they are thus on the time-scale of interest. In the derivation
of the gyrokinetic equations, the time-scale of the gyration is dropped and the phase space is transformed from
being six-dimensional with x and v to a ﬁve-dimensional one with x, the velocity parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld
line v and the magnetic moment μ, which is basically giving the velocity of the gyration. The position of the
charged particle in the gyration (gyro angle) is not resolved anymore. This and many other simpliﬁcation steps
(an exhaustive description can be found in [13]) lead to the gyrokinetic equations. The general form of the
gyrokinetic equations implemented in GENE [2, 14] is then
∂g
= L(g) + N(g)
∂t

with g being a vector holding the linearized grid values of the transformed ﬁve-dimensional distribution function
on a discretization grid Ω. The operators N and L are the nonlinear and linear operators respectively. Whereas
the nonlinear operator N drives the dynamics of the plasma microturbulence, already an analysis of the linear
operator L reveals the microinstabilities driving the microturbulence. The inﬂuence of the nonlinear operator
N grows with the amplitude of the instability, thus it has no inﬂuence before the instability appears. Since the
operator L is linear, it can be represented as a matrix L which has about 30% non-zero entries and a rank of at
least a few hundred thousand unknowns. Due to the large size and the rather dense structure, L is only accessible
in GENE by the matrix-vector product Lg for eﬃcient computations. The analysis of the equation
∂g
= Lg
∂t

(5)

is then giving some insight in the cause of plasma turbulence and it might even be used to create quasilinear
transport models [15].
An analysis of the eigenvalues of L reveals a typical spectrum of the linear operator [11]. Only the few eigenvalues having a positive real part represent the growing modes in the plasma. All the other modes have slightly
negative real parts an do thus represent damped modes. But note, that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues
are in general considerably larger than the real parts and postive as well as negative. Nevertheless the eigenvalues of interest have imaginary parts of a size comparable to the positive real parts. In GENE a preconditioned
Jacobi-Davidson solver retrieves these few eigenvalues using the numerical toolkit SLEPc [12] with a moderate
scalability. Previous approaches had to use a shift-invert preconditioner to isolate the interesting eigenvalues in
the spectrum [11].
3. The Sparse Grid Combination Technique
The sparse grid combination technique and a few of its existing variations are introduced in this section. Note
that the presented schemes are have been applied to other problems before, but their basic mode of action of the
schemes used throughout the paper shall be discussed here.
The basic concept of the sparse grid combination technique [5] is the creation of a sparse grid approximation
of a function f deﬁned on a grid Ωm of resolution 2mi + 1 for the ith of d dimensions and m ∈ Nd . For that, n
diﬀerent approximations fl of f on grids of smaller resolution Ωl are used, where
l ∈ Nd ,

0 ≤ li ≤ mi

for i = 1, . . . , d

with the level vector l again giving the resolution 2li + 1 for the ith of d dimensions. Since these approximations
are done on smaller grids, they are obtained faster in general than the original approximation fm and they can be
computed completely in parallel since they are independent. They are then appropriately combined by
fc (x) =

cl fl (x)

with

x ∈ Rd , c ∈ Rn

with Im being an index set [9] of choice. Im is a set of various level vectors l

describing the diﬀerent grid sizes used for combination and with m being the least (componentwise) upper bound
of all elements. To be used for combination it has to be admissible, thus
l − e j ∈ Im

for

1 ≤ j ≤ d,

l j > lmin

(8)

holds for each l ∈ Im , with lmin being the minimum level of resolution in each dimension and e j with e ji = 1
for i = j and e ji = 0 otherwise. The index set is thus determining which grid Ωl to use for the combination. For

all grids having level vectors |l|1 = m − 1.

with the characteristic function χIm (l), which is one if l ∈ Im and zero otherwise. There is an algorithm, which
can adaptively reﬁne the index set to improve the approximation quality of combination to be closer to the full
grid solution, if an appropriate error estimator is at hand [16].
For our studies of the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem, we chose two types of index sets which have been
studied before in linear gyrokinetics [6]: a tilted hyperplane in the space of the level vectors and a strongly
degenerated index set, which is the two-scale scheme [17]. The ﬁrst is basically changing the index set of the
classical combination technique (9) in a dimension adaptive way, which is a distortion of the hyperplane to higher
or lower resolution in diﬀerent
ﬀ
dimensions. All l in this kind of index set should fulﬁll

for an m which does not necessarily has the same resolution in each direction. This might have the advantage that
anisotropies in f are considered and the quality of the combination approximation is improved to be closer to the
full grid solution.
In the two-scale scheme at maximum d + 1 grids are combined to retrieve a sparse grid solution by

which uses usually fewer grids for combination than in the case of the tilted hyperplane, but the grids used are
usually of higher resolution, so that a good approximation is achievable. Both schemes are visualized in Fig. 2.

In this paper these combination techniques, which have been studied before in other contexts, are used for
extrapolating the eigenvalues of the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem. The optimized combination technique de¨
veloped for solving eigenvalue problems in the Schrodinger
equations [18] can unfortunately not be used here,
since the linear gyrokinetic operator is not hermitian so that we rely on the previously described combination
techniques.
4. Results
To test the approximation of the eigenvalues of the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem, a problem from the GENE
testsuite has been chosen. The test number three of the testsuite already contains some signiﬁcant properties of
typical gyrokinetic eigenvalue problems, which are the existence of more than one eigenvalue with a positive real
part, non-zero ratio between the plasma pressure and the pressure of the magnetic ﬁeld and the simulation of more
than one species. Since an analytic solution of that problem is not available, a solution of the eigenvalue problem
with a reasonably high resolution λm is chosen as reference solution. This high resolution is chosen, since in this

simulated species (deuterium ions and electrons). This reference grid Ωm is represented by a level vector m = [5, 1, 5, 6, 4]. Note the we have
actually a grid size in nz0 reduced by one, due to a special boundary condition in that direction.

range, the eigenvalues seem to have converged and they will thus be used as a reference solution. The resolution
is also rather anisotropic since the behavior of the hot magnetized fusion plasma is also strongly anisotropic in
spatial as well as velocity dimensions.
The performance of the combination technique can already be measured in its ability to retrieve an approximation of the eigenvalues of the problem (5). Even if the reference solution λm is not fully converged yet, it has been
shown that the sparse grid combination technique can be used to extrapolate approximations if a suﬃcient error
splitting of eigenvalues can be done [19]. That behavior can be seen in the next section. To retrieve an approximation of the eigenvalue, the eigenvalue problem is solved on several grids of diﬀerent
ﬀ
size Ωl with resolutions
l to compute λl . A set of diﬀerent
ﬀ
λl is depicted in Fig. 3. There exist two eigenvalues with a positive real part.
The eigenvalue with the larger real part is denoted by λ(1) and the other one with λ(2) . The index set S used for the
combination is varied according to the diﬀerent
ﬀ
combination schemes mentioned in Sec. 3. These solutions are
then combined by

to retrieve the combined approximation of the eigenvalue λ(k)
c on the resolution given in Table 1. Depending on the
chosen index set the quality of the retrieved eigenvalues is varying, which is described in the next section Sec. 4.1.
The index sets in this study are either created by the method of the tilted hyperplane or the two-scale scheme.
The reference grid size described in Tab. 1 is always used as the maximum m of all the index sets, thus all used
index sets are S ⊂ {l ∈ Nd : li ≤ mi ∀i = 1, . . . , d}. The minimal grid size is then varied for all index sets, to

achieve sparse grid approximations using denser grids. Basically all combinations of minimal levels are used in
the following for combination.
4.1. Accuracy
In Fig. 4 one can see the performance of all index sets created by the various methods described in Sec. 3 using
all the grids used in Fig. 3. One can clearly see that approximation quality of nearly all λc is better than the ones
created by the coarsely resolved grids. That has already a payoﬀ since it is now possible to compute an eigenvalue
using the inherent parallelism of the combination technique, since the solution quality is better than the coarse
grained approximation of the low resolution grids. But even for high accuracy approximations the combination
technique gives good results. In the right-hand plot of Fig. 4 one can see, that many combination solutions actually
lie in the vicinity of the converged eigenvalue. Only a very few full grid solutions lie even close to that value so
that the combination technique has clearly an advantage since it is not only computed inherently in parallel but
also more accurate than most of the full grid solutions.
The ability of the combination technique to actually create better approximations of the eigenvalue λm from
(1)
approximations of reduced accuracy can be seen in Fig. 5a, where the relative error of the λ(1)
c and λl are computed

Fig. 5. (a) A plot showing the quality of the solutions used for the combination. Each point shows the error of an approximation λl on the
y-axis, whereas its x-coordinate is determined by the error of the combined eigenvalue λc it is used for. Since every approximation λl is
usually used in multiple combination schemes, the data points appear multiple times in horizontal direction. The diagonal line indicates the
accuracy of the combined solution. The graph thus shows the areas of accuracy, where the combination of the grids leads to a more accurate
approximation of the eigenvalue compared to the eigenvalues computed by each of the grids. On the left-hand side it can be observed, that
the highest accuracy approximation can actually only be achieved by the combination technique. Only in few cases and mostly for coarse
approximations, the error the used grids used for combination are smaller than for the combined results.(b) The accuracy of the combined
solutions λc , plotted against the number of grids used in the combination scheme to obtain this solution. In general the combinations of fewer

(14)

Thus the combination technique allows to retrieve accuracies which would only be achievable by doing computations on the full grid with the resolution from Table 1, but with a lower computational eﬀort and an increased
inherent parallelism.
4.2. Eﬀort
To be able to evaluate the usefulness of the combination technique it is important to know the computational
eﬀort required to retrieve a combined solution. The overall eﬀort for computing the combined solution λc is only
determined by the eﬀort to solve the individual eigenvalue problems on the grid Ωl . The combination of the
eigenvalues itself is basically done with no eﬀort.
But real application scenarios could require an additional check of the eigenvalues. In some cases two eigenvalues of the exact problem can have rather similar values [20] so that the respective eigenvectors have to be
utilized to distinguish them. The combination is valid if always the eigenvalues corresponding to the same eigenvector are combined. So in this case, all the eigenvectors g(k)
l have to be compared to identify corresponding ones.
Similar problems exist for other applications using the combination technique for retrieving eigenvalues [21]. For
the current test problem this fact did not have to be considered since the eigenmodes could be easily distinguished.
The computational eﬀort to retrieve a single solution on a grid Ωl can on the one hand be measured by the
time to get a solution and on the other side by the grid size itself. The ﬁrst is currently rather diﬃcult to achieve,
since the partly strongly anisotropic grids Ωl do not allow the same domain decomposition as the more isotropic
ones. Using diﬀerent domain decompositions leads to tremendously changed runtimes of GENE, so that a fair
comparison cannot be given using the computing time as an indicator. Instead we want to focus on the grid-size
itself, since it can already give a clearer picture on the memory requirements and the computational eﬀort.

the eigenvalue computation. (a) The eﬀort to retrieve a combined solution estimated by the overall number of degrees of freedom N. (b) The
same, but with the eﬀort estimated by the number of degrees of freedom of the largest of the Ωl used for each combination.

In the left graph of Fig. 6 the accuracy of the combined solutions and the solutions used for combination are
shown. The computational eﬀort in the abscissa is estimated by the sum of the degrees of freedom l∈S Nl . The
grids used for combination do respectively just have their respective number of degrees of freedom as an indicator
for the eﬀort. One can clearly see, that the solution λl can be retrieved with much smaller grid sizes but also
with in general lower accuracies. The combined approximations on the other hand have in general a rather high
accuracy, which could already be seen in Fig. 3. In Fig. 6 one can see that this accuracy is a trade-oﬀ with an on
average higher number of degrees of freedom. Nevertheless some approximations exist, which even require less
overall grid points and achieve a comparable accuracy.
Since the computation of the approximations λl can be embarrassingly parallelized, the overall eﬀort in computation time can be estimated by the number of grid points in the largest grid used for combination. That grid is
then the determining the overall computation time of the combined eigenvalue λc . The right-hand graph in Fig. 6
has exactly this grid size as abscissa so that the balance between accuracy and eﬀort is now even more favorable
for the combined solutions. That means, having a parallel machine at hand, approximation of the eigenvalues can
be retrieved faster with a reasonable accuracy with the combination technique.
Analyzing the possibility of parallelization even further reveals another criterion for evaluating the performance of the combination technique. Since a lot of the combination schemes lead to reasonable high accuracy
with a relative error below 10−3 , in Fig. 5b the diﬀerent schemes are distinguished by the number of grids used to
obtain λc . The graph shows, that there is a trend, that using less grids with presumably higher resolutions l leads
in general to more accurate solutions, thus the level of inherent parallelism adjusts the retrievable accuracy of the
combined eigenvalue.
4.3. Comparing the diﬀerent combination schemes
In the previous section, diﬀerent criteria to evaluate the combination schemes have been shown, which are
now used to ﬁnd the most suitable combination scheme. Using the accuracy as a criterion, the schemes in Table 2
are the optimal ones. From this set of combination schemes, the three best approximations S1 , S2 , S3 only used
three grids for the combination. Since these are rather large grids, the overall number of used grid points and the

size of the largest used grid is rather high. The fourth scheme S4 uses ﬁve grids and the overall number of grid
points is on par with the previous grids, whereas the size of the largest grid is only half of the largest grid of the
previous schemes. Together with the higher number in grids, this scheme is favorable, if the six times decreased
accuracy is acceptable. The scheme with the index set S5 is again using only three grids.
Taking only into account the overall number of grid points used, one can identify the optimal schemes having a balance of accuracy and eﬀort to compute the combination. Besides the three best schemes in Table 2
S1 , S2 , S3 , only a single combination scheme seems to provide better accuracy than the regular full grids used for
the combination: the scheme combining the grids Ωl with
l ∈ S6 = {[2, 1, 3, 5, 3], [3, 1, 3, 5, 2], [2, 1, 3, 5, 2], [5, 1, 3, 5, 2], [3, 1, 4, 5, 2],
[2, 1, 5, 5, 2], [2, 1, 4, 5, 2], [2, 1, 3, 5, 4], [3, 1, 3, 5, 3], [2, 1, 3, 6, 2]}
which leads to overall 388208 grid points and a number of grid point in the largest grid of 87120. The scheme
leads to a combined eigenvalue with the relative error of 6.04 × 10−4 . This scheme is thus favorable if smaller
accuracy is required and it has the nice properties of having ten grids, allowing a further parallelization. Taking
only the grid size of the largest grid into account, the grid with the index set S4 , S6 and the grid with the index set
l ∈ S7 = {[3, 1, 3, 5, 2], [3, 1, 3, 4, 2], [3, 1, 4, 5, 2], [3, 1, 4, 4, 2], [3, 1, 3, 5, 3],
[3, 1, 5, 4, 2], [4, 1, 4, 4, 2], [4, 1, 3, 4, 2], [3, 1, 4, 4, 3], [3, 1, 3, 4, 3],
[4, 1, 3, 5, 2], [4, 1, 3, 4, 3], [3, 1, 3, 4, 4], [5, 1, 3, 4, 2], [3, 1, 3, 6, 2]}
is favorable as well. S7 has only 46240 grid points in its largest grid and has 554976 grid points in all grids to
achieve an approximation of the eigenvalue with an error of 3.90 × 10−3 .
The optimal choice of the index set is thus depending on the requirement of the underlying application. If
a high grade in parallelization shall be achieved the number of grids used for combination has to be high and
the scheme S4 , S6 , S7 should be chosen, depending on the desired accuracy. If only the minimal number of
overall grid points is required, the schemes S2 , S3 , S4 give reasonable results or for lower accuracy approximations
scheme S6 . Following the scheme with index set S4 thus seems to give the best balance between accuracy, overall
grid size, size of the largest grid and overall number of grids.
All index sets are either created by the two-scale scheme (S1 , S2 , S3 , S5 ) or by creating a tilted hyperplane
in the space of the level vectors (S4 , S6 , S7 ). Thus these ways to create index sets will be favorable in using the
sparse grid combination technique for solving the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem. But further studies are required
to establish a heuristic with which the suitable combination scheme can be determined a priori.
5. Summary
The basic principles of linear gyrokinetics and the sparse grid combination technique have been presented. A
set of index sets using either a tilted hyperplane in the space of level vectors or the two-scale scheme has been

458

used. The sparse grid combination technique has then been applied to the gyrokinetic eigenvalue problem using
the code GENE and these set of index sets. The eigenvalue could be approximated up to an accuracy of 10−6 , with
an inherent parallelization of three grids and an overall spent degrees of freedom on par with the original problem.
Also more than three grids could be used for combination with the eﬀect of having a slightly reduced accuracy
in ﬁnding the eigenvalue. Thus the choice of the combination technique depends also on the balance between the
required parallelism and the envisioned accuracy of the combined solution, with the tilted hyperplane index set
being more suitable for a parallelization and the two-scale being better in terms of accuracy. Future work will
include the combination of the retrieved eigenvectors as well, which can, due to their free scaling, not be done
in a straightforward manner. That would then allow the faster application of a quasilinear transport model and a
more eﬃcient search for suitable parameter regimes with suitable ﬂuxes of heat and transport in fusion plasmas.
Also the combination technique might allow to compute eigenvalues of global gyrokinetic problems, which are
actually taking the whole cross section of a tokamak as computation domain and where so far computationally not
feasible.
