sense that the finite element solution converges but not to the true solution. In [9, 8, 10, 11], L2
projection methods have been developed to use the node-based continuous Lagrange element
for the non H 1 solutions in the context of Maxwell equations. The key feature therein is to
apply the L2 projections to the partial derivatives operators (i.e., the curl and the divergence
operators) of the flux. The approximation of the flux with the use of the node-based continuous
Lagrange element of H 1 -conforming would be very informative, e.g., it provides a global continuous approximation, the software and algorithms of node-based continuous Lagrange element
is readily available, the program may be quite easily coded, the simple shape-functions, etc.
Relatively, the H(div; Ω)-conforming approximation of the flux would be more costly.
The goal of this paper is to analyze stabilized methods, and then to compare the numerical
performance of the stabilization in this paper with those stabilizations in [9, 8, 11, 23]. From the
numerical results, we find that all the stabilization methods do not exhibit the same numerical
accuracy, although they can evenly well approximate non H 1 solutions of (H r (Ω))2 for some
r > 1/2, optimal in the regularity of the exact solution. The stabilization analyzed in this paper
is simpler, consistent, and provides accurate node-based continuous approximations for both
smooth solutions and singular solutions of non H 1 . We note that the role of the stabilizations
is to remedy the loss of the stability caused by the L2 projections.

Equations of Flux

Given a polygonal domain Ω ⊂ R2 , with boundary Γ. We introduce some differential operators.
For scalar function q and vector function v = (v1 , v2 ), curl operator and div operator are defined
as follows: ∇q = (∂x ψ, ∂y ψ), div v = ∂x v1 + ∂y v2 , curl q = (∂y q, −∂x q), curl v = ∂x v2 − ∂y v1 .
Given known source functions f and g. Let t be the unit tangential vector along the boundary
Γ. Consider the equations of flux as follows:

 curl u = f in Ω,
div u = g in Ω,
(1)

u·t=0
on Γ.

The boundary condition is the perfect conductor boundary condition. Another possible condition is u · n = 0 on Γ. The system of equations (1) is the simplest model for the flux variable.
From the Poisson equations of Dirichlet boundary condition, i.e.,
−∆p = g

in Ω,

p=0

on Γ,

(2)

putting the flux variable
u = −∇p,

(3)

we obtain the equations of the flux variable in (1), with f = 0. One may consider the more
general boundary value problem of advection-diffusion equations:
−ε∆p + b · ∇p = g

in Ω,

p=0

on Γ,

where ε is the diffusivity and b the advection field. With the flux variable (3), we obtain

in Ω,
 curl u = 0
εdiv u − b · u = g in Ω,

u·t=0
on Γ.

Duan and Li

The methods in this paper can be straightforwardly applied to (4). However, the presence of
the advection field (i.e., b) makes the approximation of the flux variable much more difficult,
when the advection is dominated. We may consider other problems as well, such as the Maxwell
equations and Navier-Stokes equations. For example, a model which covers both the Maxwell
equations and Stokes equations is −ν∆u+∇p = f in Ω, div u = 0 in Ω, n×u = 0 on Γ.
However, all these are beyond the scope of this paper.

Finite Element Approximation

In this section, we consider a finite element method, which is quite standard. For this purpose, we give some standard Hilbert spaces[1, 15] H 1 (Ω) = {q ∈ L2 (Ω) : ∇q ∈ (L2 (Ω))2 },
H(curl; Ω) = {v ∈ (L2 (Ω))2 : curl v ∈ L2 (Ω)}, H(div; Ω) = {v ∈ (L2 (Ω))2 : div v ∈ L2 (Ω)},
H0 (curl; Ω) = {v ∈ H(curl; Ω) : v · t|Γ = 0},

(5)
XN = H0 (curl; Ω) H(div; Ω),
Define the norm v2XN = curl v20 + div v20 , where  · 0 denotes the L2 norm.
According to (1), we define the bilinear form and the linear form:
a(u, v) = (curl u, curl v) + (div u, div v)
b(v) = (f, curl v) + (g, div v)

∀u ∈ XN , ∀v ∈ XN ,

(6)

∀v ∈ XN .

(7)

where (·, ·) is the L2 inner product. A variational problem for (1) can be stated as follows: Find
u ∈ XN such that
∀v ∈ XN .

a(u, v) = b(v)

1

Then, the finite element problem is to find uh ∈ Uh ⊂ (H (Ω))
a(uh , v) = b(v)

∀v ∈ Uh .

2



(8)

XN such that
(9)

We collect the properties of the bilinear form a(·, ·) as follows[15]:

(i) Boundeness: |a(u, v)| ≤ CuXN vXN ,
(ii) Coercivity: a(v, v) ≥

Cv2XN

∀u ∈ XN , ∀v ∈ XN ,

∀v ∈ XN ,

(iii) When v ∈ (H 1 (Ω))2 ∩ XN , a(v, v) ≥ Cv21 .

Consequently, if the exact solution of (1) u ∈ (H r (Ω))2 , r ≥ 1, the finite element method (9) will
perform very well, with the convergence order optimal in both the order of approximation and
the regularity of the exact solution. However, when r < 1, the node-based continuous Lagrange
element space Uh is not dense in the XN space with respect to the norm  · XN ; consequently,
for r < 1, we cannot expect that the finite element method (9) can produce correctly convergent
approximations. We point out that the limit of the finite element solution as themesh size h
tends to zero is the solution of the variational problem (8) over the space (H 1 (Ω))2 XN , while
the exact solution is posed in the space XN only. No matter how the meshes are refined, how
the order of finite element space is high, one just see that finite element method (9) fails for
the non H 1 solution. However, from the classical finite element approximation theory, with
respect to the L2 norm  · 0 , Uh is indeed dense in XN . This fact is the critical idea of the L2
projection methods developed in [9, 8, 10, 11], approximating the exact solution in the (L2 (Ω))2
space not in the space XN . On the other hand, the L2 projections lose the coercivity, and some
stabilizations have to be used. As usual, the stabilizations consist of the residual of partial
differential equations.

Stabilized Finite Element Method

In this section, we introduce the stabilized finite element methods with the local L2 projection.
Let Th denote the shape-regular triangulation of Ω̄ into triangles. Let h = maxT ∈Th hT ,
where hT is the diameter of the triangle T ∈ Th . Let P (T ) stand for the space on T of
polynomials of total degree not greater than  ≥ 0. Define the H 1 (Ω)-conforming node-based
continuous Lagrange finite element spaces:
Uh = {v ∈ (H 1 (Ω))2 : v|T ∈ (P (T ))2 , ∀T ∈ Th , v · t|Γ = 0, }, where

 ≥ 1.

(10)

Introduce the local constant element L2 projection Rh0 which is defined as follows: for a
given w ∈ L2 (Ω), for each T ∈ Th , define Rh0 w ∈ P0 (T ) by

w

(11)
Rh w|T = T ,
|T |
where (·, ·)0,T denotes the L2 inner product on T and |T | is the area of T . With the local
L2 projection, we define three stabilized finite element methods, labelled as Methods (A)-(C),
corresponding respectively to the following three bilinear forms and linear forms:
Method (A):

Fh2 (v) = (f, Rh0 curl v) + (g, Rh0 div v).

(13)

Method (C):
Denote by bT = λ1 λ2 λ3 , where λi , i = 1, 2, 3, are the local basis functions of P1 (T ).

Method (C) is originally proposed in [9, 8], while the stabilization in Method (A) is also
stipulated from therein. In inhomogeneous media, it is analyzed in [11]. The stabilization in
Method (B) may also be found for the Maxwell equations in [23]. One can verify that Methods
(A) and (C) are consistent in the usual sense, i.e., for the solution u of (1), we have
Lih (u, v) = Fhi (v),

i = 1, 3, ∀v ∈ Uh ,

(17)

but Method (B) is not. For  = 1, i.e., Uh is the P1 element, all the three methods essentially
restore to the finite element method (9), and consequently, they produce wrong approximations
of the non H 1 flux variable. The stabilization terms play no roles. For  = 2, all the three
methods lose the coercivity because of the L2 projections, and thus, the stabilizations are used
to retain the coercivity. More details see the next section.

Coercivity

In this section, we show the coercivity of Methods (A)-(C). For convenience, we denote by
Shi (u, v) the different stabilizations respectively corresponding to Methods (A)-(C).
Lemma 1. On Lipschitz domain Ω, for any v ∈ XN ∩ (H 1 (Ω))2 , we have[15]
curl v20 + div v20 = ∇v 20 .
Lemma 2. There exists a constant C1 independent of h such that
C1 Sh1 (v, v) ≤ Sh2 (v, v)

∀v ∈ Uh .

Proof. From [2], we have
C2



T ∈Th

h2T ||∇v||20,T ≤ Sh2 (v, v) ≤ C3



T ∈Th

h2T ||∇v||20,T .

(18)

On the other hand, we have
Sh1 (v, v) ≤ C



T ∈Th

h2T ||∇v||20,T .

The conclusion follows.
We do not have the reverse inequality between Sh1 (v, v) and Sh2 (v, v). Only when hT = h
for all T ∈ Th , from Lemma 1 and (18), we have Sh2 (v, v) ≤ C4 Sh1 (v, v) for all v ∈ Uh .
Lemma 3. For any v ∈ Uh , there exists constants C5 and C6 , which are all independent of h,
such that
Rh0 curl v20 + Rh0 div v20 ≥ C5  v 20 −C6 Sh1 (v, v).
Proof. It follows from [9] and the details of proof are omitted here.
Theorem 1. For any v ∈ Uh , there exists a constant C is independent of h such that
L2h (v, v) ≥ C  v 20 .

Following [9, 8], we can show that there exist two constants C1 and C2 , which are independent of h, such that
C7 Sh1 (v, v) ≤ Sh3 (v, v) ≤ C8 Sh1 (v, v)

∀v ∈ Uh .

(19)

Similarly, from Lemma 3 and (19), one can show the coercivity properties of Method (A) and
Method (C).

Error Bounds

In the previous section, we have obtained the coercivity. Next, we shall establish the error
bounds.
Lemma 4. Assume that u ∈ (H r (Ω))2 , r > 1/2. Then, there exists a finite element function
uI ∈ Uh ,  = 2, such that
(20)
Rh0 curl (u − uI )0 = 0,
Rh0 div (u − uI )0 = 0,

(21)

 u − uI 0 ≤ Chmin(r,3)  u r ,

(22)

and moreover, there holds the following error estimates:

where C is a constant not depending on h, and  · r is the norm of Hilbert space H r (Ω).
Proof. This lemma can be shown by the argument in [9].
We analyze Method (A) in details. Define the energy norm:
|v|2 := L1h (v, v).
To deal with the stabilization in Method (A), we first show a lemma. For this purpose, letting
Eh0 and EhΓ respectively be the set of interior edges and of the edges on Γ, we introduce a
nonconforming linear element which is quite similar to that of [4].

curl (u − ũ)0,T ≤ 2curl u0,T , div (u − ũ)0,T ≤ 2div u0,T

Lemma 5. Assume that u ∈ (H r (Ω))2 for some r > 1/2 is the exact solution, additionally
satisfying curl u, div u ∈ L2 (Ω). Let uI be the finite element interpolation which is constructed
in Lemma 4. Then,

h2T (curl (u − uI )20,T + div (u − uI )20,T ) ≤ Ch2r (u2r + div u20 + curl u20 ). (23)
T ∈Th

Proof. The argument is adapted from [11]. Denote by ũ the finite element interpolation of u
h . By the triangle inequality, inverse estimates in [3], and Lemma 4, we have
in U
h2T  curl (u − uI ) 20,T

2h2T ( curl (u − ũ) 20,T +  curl (ũ − uI ) 20,T )

Similarly, we can show the div part. Summing over Th , we obtain (23).
Theorem 2. Let u, uh denote the exact solution and the finite element solution in Uh for
which  = 2(i.e., P2 element). Assume that u ∈ (H r (Ω))2 , r > 1/2, and curl u, div u ∈ L2 (Ω).
Then,
 u − uh 0 +|u − uh | ≤ Chr ( u r +  curl u 0 +  div u 0 ),

(24)

where C is independent of h and u.
Proof. 24 is obtained from Theorem 1, the consistency (17), Lemma 4, and Lemma 5.
Remark 1. For a smooth enough solution, we can obtain the error bound O(h3 ), which is
optimal in the order of approximation of  = 2 (i.e., the P2 element. For Method (B), from
the classical result of the L2 projection: For u ∈ (H r (Ω))2 , we have ||u − R0h u||0 ≤ Chr ||u||r ,
it is not difficult to adapt the above argument for proving Theorem 2 to obtain (see also [23])
 u − uh 0 ≤ Chr  u r . This error bound also holds for Method (C) as was shown in [9].

Numerical Results

We perform the three stabilized finite element methods. We consider the L-shaped domain. We
study two exact solutions. The first is smooth of (H 1 (Ω))2 , the second is singular and nearly
belongs to (H 2/3 (Ω))2 . The L-shaped domain: Ω = (−1, 1) × (−1, 1) \ (0, 1) × (−1, 0), where
the reentrant corner is at (0, 0). We are given a smooth solution: u = (xex sin πy, yey sin πx).
Such solution is infinitely smooth, and of course, it belongs to (H 1 (Ω))2 . In addition, we are
given a singular solution: u = (1 − x2 )(1 − y 2 )∇p, p = r2/3 sin 23 θ. This solution belongs to
(H 2/3− (Ω))2 , for any small constant  > 0. The regularity is less than one. In fact, the
solution takes an infinity at the reentrant corner. Theoretically, for smooth solution, Method
(A) and Method (C) give the optimal error bound O(h3 ), while Method (B) gives O(h) because
of the consistency error from the stabilization. For singular solution, the error bound for three
methods is the same as O(h2/3− ). The singularity of the flux is usually due to the gradient

of a scalar function, a component in the regular-singular decomposition of the flux (cf. [15]).
For comparisons, we plot the elevations and contours of the first component of the solution
u = (u1 , u2 ) of the second example for the three methods at h = 1/32. See Figures 1-6,
which are the elevations and the contours corresponding to the first component of the singular
solution. The numerical results are listed in the order: smooth solution, singular solution. From
Tables 1-2, we see that all three methods give the convergence orders which are consistent with
the theoretical predicted. For smooth solution, Method (B) gives the error bound O(h1.5 ),
much higher than the predicted O(h). On the other hand, although Sh2 (·, ·) in Method (B) may
provide stronger stability than the other two (see Lemma 2), but the numerical results show
that Method (B) gives less accurate approximations than Method (A) and Method (C). In fact,
we see that Methods (A) and (C) give more accurate approximations than Method (B). Also,
Method (A) is comparable to Method (C), although the latter is a little bit better. These can
also be seen from Figures 1-6.

Future Work

A challenging issue is whether the methods (possibly, with further stabilizations) can provide
stably accurate numerical solutions of the convection-dominated diffusion-convection problem.
This is an on-going work.
