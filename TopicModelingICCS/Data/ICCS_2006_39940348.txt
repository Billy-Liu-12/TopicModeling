Abstract. It is an observed fact in the market that the implied volatility of traded options vary from day to day. An alternative and straightforward explanation is that the instantaneous volatility of a stock is
a stochastic quantity itself. The assumptions of the Black and Scholes
model no longer hold. This is, therefore, one reason why Black and Scholes prices can diﬀer from market prices of options. Having decided
to make the instantaneous volatility stochastic, it is necessary to decide what sort of process it follows. The article analyzes three stochastic
volatility models and considers how stochastic volatility can be incorporated into model prices of options. The investigation of stochastic volatility inﬂuence for pricing options traded in the SEB Vilnius Bank is done.

Introduction

The pricing of derivative instruments, such as options is a function of the movement in the price of the underlying asset over lifetime of the option. One of the
main problems of ﬁnancial engineering is to develop a suitable model of ﬁnancial
assets dynamics. The dynamics is described as a stochastic process, and pricing
models describe the stochastic dynamics of asset price changes, whether this is a
change in share prices, stock indices, interest rates and so on. Louis Bachelier [1]
had claimed that stock prices are actually random in 1900. Comparing trajectories of random walks and stock prices, Bachielier could not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence among them. The dynamics of asset prices are reﬂected by uncertain
movements of their values over time. Some authors [2, 3, 4, 14] state that eﬃcient market Hypothesis (EMH) is one possible reason for the random behavior
of the asset price. The EMH basically states that past history is fully reﬂected
in present prices and markets respond immediately to new information about
the asset.
The classical approach is to specify a diﬀusion process for the asset price, that
is, a stochastic integral or stochastic diﬀerential equation where the uncertainty
is driven by Wiener process. The wide spread adoption of Wiener process as a
frame work for describing changes in ﬁnancial asset prices is most like due to its
analytic tractability.
Unfortunately, in recent years more and more attention has been given to
stochastic models of ﬁnancial markets which diﬀer from traditional models. It
appears that variances and covariances are not constant over time. There is now
a lot of literature on time series modeling of asset prices. The reviewed literature

[5, 6] has revealed the following empirical properties of asset dynamics: fat tails of
distribution, volatility clustering, large discrete jumps, and parameter instability.
Some classical models of asset dynamics are presented in the article and
stochastic volatility models of EUR/USD exchange rate based on the data of
trading options in SEB Vilnius Bank are analyzed also.

The Stochastic Process of Stock Prices

The modeling of the asset price is concerned with the modeling of new information arrival, which aﬀects the price. Depending on the appearance of the so
called “normal” and “rare” events, there are two basic blocks in modeling the
continuous time asset price. Neftci [7] states that the main diﬀerence between the
“normal” and “rare” behavior concerns the size of the events and their probability to occur. Wiener process can be used if markets are dominated by “normal”
events. This is a continuous time stochastic process, where extremes occur only
infrequently according to the probabilities in the tails of normal distribution.
The stochastic process is written in the form of the following stochastic diﬀerential equation for the asset return: dSt = μSt dt + σSt dWt , where St – the current
price of the underlying asset, μ – the constant trend, σ – the constant volatility,
Wt – the standard Wiener process. Since this process has a continuous time sample path, it does not allow for discontinuity or jumps in its values when “rare”
events occur. In this case , the Poisson jump process can be useful. In particular,
the time series of asset price can be modeled as the sum of continuous time diffusion process and Poisson jump processes. The stochastic diﬀerential equation
for St is:
Nt

(Yj − 1)

dSt = μSt dt + σSt dWt + bSt
j=1

with the following addition of variables: Yj − 1 - a lognormal distributed random variable representing the jump size, Nt - jumps in interval (0, t) governed
by a Poisson process with parameter λt, b – constant. Jump diﬀusion models
undoubtedly capture a real phenomenon. Yet they are rarely used in practice
due to diﬃculty in parameter estimation.

Stochastic Volatility Models

Most options are priced using the Black and Scholes formula, but it is well known
that the assumptions upon which this formula is based are not justiﬁed empirically [12]. In particular, return distribution may be fat tailed and its volatility is
certainly not constant. It is an observed fact in ﬁnancial market that the implied
volatilities of traded options vary from day to day. An alternative and straightforward explanation is that the instantaneous volatility of a stock is itself a
stochastic quantity. Having decided to make volatility stochastic, it is necessary
to decide what sort of process follows. Take a process of the form [11]:

350

A. Valaityt˙e and E. Valakeviˇcius

dSt = μ(St , νt )dt + σ(St , νt )dWSt

(1)

σ(St , νt ) = f (νt )

(2)

dνt = σ(St , νt )dt + β(St , νt )dWνt

(3)

where WSt , Wν are correlated Wiener processes with correlation coeﬃcient
ρ , i.e,
dWν = ρdWSt +

1 − p2 dZt

(4)

WSt and Zt are uncorrelated Wiener processes [13].
Three diﬀerent stochastic volatility models will be considered, such as: HullWhite, Heston, and logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck. The Hull-White model [9]
is the particular case of the model described by (1) – (4) equations. Then we
have that
dνt = γνt dt + ηνt dWνt
(5)
dSt = μSt dt + σt St dWSt ,
√
where σt = ν t , γ < 0, WSt , and Wνt are uncorrelated Wiener processes.
For simplicity, assume that volatility can take only two values. In this case the
price of Call option is equal to Ct = E CBS t, S, K, T, σ 2 νt = ν where
σ2 =

1
T −t

T
t

f νx

dx, νt is the two state Markov process [13] and
σ2 =

σ12 with probability p
σ22 with probability 1 − p

Heston’s option pricing model assumes that St and νt satisﬁes the equations [10]:
dSt = μSt dt + σt St dWSt ,

√
dνt = κ θ − νt dt + η νt dWνt

(6)

√
where σt = νt , κ, θ, η, ρ are constants.
The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck’s stochastic volatility model is
dSt = μSt dt + σt St dWSt ,

dνt = α ν − νt dt + βdWνt

(7)

where σt = exp(νt ). The empirical investigation shows that lnσt follows
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with parameters lnσ and α > 0. It is usual to assume that μ, α(lnσ − νt ) and β are constants. Let ρ = 0.

Estimation of Parameters of Stochastic Volatility
Models

Parameters of stochastic volatility models are estimated on observations of assets
and options price dynamics. There are three unknown parameters in the HullWhite model: σ1 , σ2 , and p, which are estimated by the method of least
squares :

where n - the number of traded options per day, Cmarketi – the market price
of ith option with strike price Ki , Cmodel σ1 , σ2 , p, Ki – the price of option
evaluated by Hull-White model.
The parameters of Heston and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models are estimated applying two steps procedure [12]. At ﬁrst parameters μ, κ, θ, η must be valuated.
Say that μ = 0, then the equation (6) in discrete case has the form:
√
√
Rt = νt τ ε1t ,
νt = κθτ + 1 − κτ νt−τ + η νt−τ τ ε2t
where Rt - the return rate of the asset, ε1t and ε2t - two standard normal
distributed correlated values. It is constructed the auxiliary GARCH(1,1) model:
Rt =

ht ε t ,

ht = ω + αε2t−1 + βht−1

Where: εt - normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance ht . In
this case it is possible to estimate only three parameters κ, θ, η and coeﬃcient
of correlation is equated zero. The theoretical return rate are matching with
empirical data when parameters κ, θ, η and τ are chosen.
Applying GARCH(1,1) model, the set of optimal parameters B = ω, α, β
for given data of the asset return rates is obtained. Thus, the set of parameters
Θ = κ, θ, η is known for each modeled time series. The next step is to compute
the vector

where Rt (Θ) are rates of modeled returns, N – the number of modeling steps. If
m equals zero, then the modeled data obtained by GARCH(1,1) model will have
the same parameters as observed data. The optimal set of parameters is valuated

Having the estimations (κ, θ, η), the coeﬃcient of correlation ρ is calculated
by the method of least squares. The error between market and model prices is

Empirical Investigation of the Models

The prices of European call options traded on exchange rate EUR/USD in SEB
Vilnius Bank (Lithuania) will be investigated. The observed data are divided into
several groups according to the proﬁtability (S/K − 1) and life time of options.
Suppose that an option is at the money (ATM) if S = K or proﬁtability belongs
to the interval (–0,5%, 0,5%.). An option is in the money (ITM) if S > K or
proﬁtability belongs to the interval (0.5%, 1%) and out of the money (OTM)
if S < K or the proﬁtability belongs to the interval (-1%, -0,5%). An option is
deep out of the money (DOTM) if proﬁtability is less than -1%. An option is
called short term if the life time of the option is equal to 1 month, intermediate
- 3 months, and long term - 6 months. Daily observations of 82 days (from
2005-01-05 till 2005-04-30, totally 969 observations) were used for investigation.
The values of implied volatility depend on the proﬁtability and are calculated
applying the above described models. The graphs of volatility smile are depicted
in the Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Volatility smile for options of 1 month period

The implied volatility values of Hull-White model were computed by (5) equations. Thus
F (I) ≡ CBS (I) − pCBS (σ1 ) − (1 − p)CBS (σ2 ) = 0
where:CBS – value obtained by Black-Scholes formula [8], I –implied volatility
calculated by the method of Newton – Rapson.
Simulation by the method of Monte Carlo was carried out by the following
algorithm:
1. Obtained paths of asset price and volatility by the Hestono and OrnsteinUhlenbeck models.
2. Computed values of options at the end of each day: h(St ) = max{0, St − K},
t = 1, T .
3. The price of option is calculated by the formula: Cmodel = e−rBase T E h(ST ) .
4. The values of volatility are derived from the equation CBS (I) − Cmodel = 0.

Stochastic Volatility Models and Option Prices

Theoretical price of an option is approximate to the market price if the obtained
volatility value is close to the value of implied volatility derived from the BlackScholes.
Models of the stochastic volatility overprice DOTM and ITM options and
undervalue OTM options, except Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model which overprices all
options (Table 1). This is obviously seen for short term options. The stochastic
volatility models are more practical for pricing intermediate and short term
options. Errors of options pricing are estimated in two ways: average relative

the Hull-White model undervalue ITM options of all terms (Table 2). The pricing
errors of ITM, DOTM, and short term options are the largest one. The HullWhite model is clearly superior comparing with the Black-Scholes and other
stochastic volatility models. Relative options pricing errors of the Hull-White
model are less then Black-Scholes one in 7 cases from 12. Rising duration of
options their pricing errors decline. ARPE and ASE errors coincide.

Conclusions

1. Stochastic volatility models are more preferable for intermediate and long
duration options.
2. In respect of proﬁtability a stochastic volatility parameter is greater (less)
then implied volatility parameter for DOTM and ITM (OTM) options.
3. All the volatility models (except Heston model) overvalue DOTM and ITM
options but undervalue ATM options. The Hull – White model gives the
least option pricing error and the most one gives the Heston model.
4. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model is suitable for pricing long term options and
the Hull-White – model is relevant for various duration options.
