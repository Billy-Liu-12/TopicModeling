Abstract. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, called FuzzyAntNet
inspired by swarm intelligence and optimized by fuzzy systems. FuzzyAntNet
is a new routing algorithm which is constructed by the communication model
observed in ant colonies, and enhanced with fuzzy systems. Two special
characteristics of this method are scalability to network changes and capability
to recognize the best route from source to destination with low delay, traffic and
high bandwidth. Using Ants (or agents) in this method cause to avoid
congestion in data packet transmission because Ants walk through paths and
intermediate routers and gather information about their delay, congestion and in
return, they update the current delay of each visited link and consequently they
bring up to date the routing probabilities table for every traversed router. We
compare FuzzyAntNet with other routing algorithms such as AntNet and
Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV).

1 Introduction
Routing algorithms in modern networks must address numerous problems. Current
routing algorithms are not adequate to tackle the increasing complexity of such
networks. Centralized algorithms have scalability problems; static algorithms have
trouble keeping up-to-date with network changes; and other distributed and dynamic
algorithms have oscillations and stability problems. One of the applications of Ant
Colony Optimization in network routing is swarm intelligence routing which provides
a promising alternative to these approaches. Swarm intelligence utilizes mobile
software agents for network management. These agents are autonomous entities, both
proactive and reactive, and have the capability to adapt, cooperate and move
intelligently from one location to the other in the communication network. In this
paper we discuss routing algorithms in section 2, present FuzzyAntNet in section 4,
and finally the simulation and results are given in section 5.

2 Routing Algorithms
Routing decisions can only be made on the basis of local and approximate
information about the current and the future network states, with additional
constraints posed by the network switching and transmission technology [1]. In this
article we focus on wide area networks, that is, irregular topology datagram networks
with an IP-like (Internet Protocol) network layer and a very simple transport layer.
The instance of the communication network is mapped on a directed weighted graph
with N nodes. All the links are viewed as having two parameters characterized by a
bandwidth and a transmission delay, and are accessed following a statistical
multiplexing scheme.

3 Ant Based Routing
In the Ant-based routing algorithm, routing is determined by means of very complex
interactions of forward and backward network exploration ants. The idea behind this
subdivision of agents is to allow the backward ants to utilize the useful information
gathered by the forward ants on their trip from source to destination. Based on this
principle, no node routing updates are performed by the forward ants. The backward
ants inherit this raw data and use it to update the routing table of the nodes [2], [3].

4 Fuzzy Ant Based Routing Method
In this section we describe our novel algorithm which we called it FuzzyAntNet.
FuzzyAntNet is constructed by the stigmergy communication model observed in ant colonies
and applied with fuzzy systems [4], [5], [6]. In this algorithm every link between two

nodes i and j is addressed as linkij and there are two parameters for each linkij : Delayij
and Bandwidthij. There are five membership functions for first input variable
(Delayij), five membership functions for second input variable (Bandwidthij), and nine
membership functions for output variable (Fuzzy-Delayij). All of the membership
functions are Triangular because it can eliminate noises and in comparison with
Gaussian membership function, the precision of Triangular is as good as Guassian

but it's computation is so easier and simpler. Before applying their values, Delayij is
normalized between (0, 1) and Bandwidthij is normalized between (0, 0.5). The engine
used, is multiplication engine. Table 2 shows the rulebase for the fuzzy system.
In this table the Values for the amount of goodness from lowest to highest are
LL(Very Low), LM, LH, ML, MM, MH, HL, HM, and HH(Very High).

In table 2 as shown, there are 25 rules for this fuzzy system. We mentioned some
of them as following:
R1: If x1 (Delay) is VL and x2(bandwidth) is VL

then Y(goodness )

is MM

R25 If x1(Delay) is VH and x2(bandwidth) is VH then y (goodness ) is MM
The output of fuzzy system is named Fuzzy_Delaykij(t). In simulation it is replaced
with delayij and computed by (2):

M : the number of fuzzy rule bases used (M=25).
nf : the number of membership functions for input variables (nf =2).
μAil(xi) : The Fuzzy value of membership functions.
In FuzzyAntNet nodes launch forward ants in regular intervals. The forward ant
keeps track of the visited notes in a stack Jk and of their associated cost
Fuzzy _ Delay nj , d . This cost can be the wait time in queue and the transmission delay
for each visited node n. The cost Sum _ Fuzzy _ Delaynj , d is defined as the sum of all
the delay costs from node n to destination node d. Once the destination d is reached,

then a backward ant is launched, which updates the distance estimation
Sum _ Fuzzy _ Delay nj , d for node n to d via j as shown in (3):
Sum_ Fuzzy_ Delay nj , d (t ) = (1 − ρ )Sum_ Fuzzy_ Delay nj , d (t − 1) + ρ Sum_ Fuzzy_ delay kn, d .

5 Simulation and Results
In our experiments, we compared FuzzyAntNet to a set of state-of-the-art algorithms
in a realistic network simulator which constructed by object oriented programming in
C++ and used network simulator 2 (ns2) as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic generator.
Both data packets and ants packet have 512 bytes length. The rate of ant packet
(overhead) for both AntNet and FuzzyAntNet is only one percent. We used a typical
network topology called TypicalNet as shown in Fig. 1.

In TypicalNet, the the traffic is generated by source node 1 and the destination is
node 9. Standard performance metrics are: Throughput, End-2-End Delay, Packet
Delivery, and Packet Drop Ratio. Comparisons of End-2-End Delay are performed for
DSDV, AntNet, and FuzzyAntNet and the results are shown in Fig. 2.
We also summarized the experimental results in Table 3 which shows that
FuzzyAntNet outperforms other routing methods in all evaluation metrics.

simulation. It also expresses good utilization of network, balancing the data packets
through networks which reduces congestion and avoids packet drops.
