Abstract. We study the problem of pricing barrier options and Russian
options driven by exponential N IG L´evy processes by simulation. Simulating at a discrete grid creates a systematic bias because the minimum
and maximum in between grid points is neglected. The proposed solution
is to simulate the large jumps only and use a Brownian approximation
for the rest combined with explicit formulas for Brownian minima and
maxima.

Introduction

Models for ﬁnancial data diﬀerent from the classical Black-Scholes (B&S) geometric Brownian motion (BM) have recently received considerable attention, see
for instance Boyarchenko & Levendorski˘i [8], Chan [9] and Schoutens [16]. The
motivation is to a large extent statistical since many log-returns show deviations from normality. The most popular alternative is L´evy process models, and
in particular the N IG model (see Barndorﬀ Nielsen [6]) has become popular
because of its ﬂexibility.
The consequence for option prices are multiple. One is non-uniqueness of
risk-neutral measures, another that the wealth of explicit formulas for BM in
the B&S world is no longer available.
For simple options like Europeans call, only marginal distributions are required and pricing may be done by numerical integration. For slightly more
complicated examples like Asian options, one may just simulate along a discrete
grid. Numerical studies for such problems and comparison with the B&S prices
have been carried out for the N IG case in Albrecher & Predota [2]. The present
paper continues this work by studying some options (barrier options and Russian
options) where the computational aspect is more complicated.

L´
evy Processes

A L´evy process is a stochastically continuous process with stationary and independent increments. This implies the existence of a characteristic exponent
(κ(ξ)) which form is given by the L´evy triplet (a, σ, ν) as follows,

2.1

The Esscher Transform

If the L´evy process Xt is a BM or a Poisson process the stock price model based
on
St = S0 eXt
is complete. In all other cases the model is incomplete (see Chan [9] and Cherny
& Shiryaev [10]) and a there are many martingale measures Q making Xt a L´evy
process and satisfying
ert = EQ [eXt ] = exp tκQ (1)

(1)

where κQ is the characteristic exponent of Xt under Q. Within the class of
exponentially tilted L´evy processes, i.e. with κQ of the form
κQ (x) = κ(x + θ) − κ(θ)

(2)

the equation κQ (1) = r has either a unique solution θ0 (this is the typical
situation for light tails and the corresponding κQ is called the Esscher transform)
or none (typical for heavy tails).
2.2

The N IG L´
evy Process

The N IG(α, β, µ, δ) distribution, deﬁned for α, δ ≥ 0, |β| ≤ α, µ ∈ IR has density
f (x) =

2
2
αδ K1 α δ + (x − µ)
π
δ 2 + (x − µ)2

exp {δγ + β(x − µ)}

where γ 2 = α2 − β 2 and K1 is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the third kind.
The N IG L´evy process is a L´evy process such that Xt has a N IG(α, β, µt, δt)
distribution. It is a pure jump process and its L´evy measure has density
ν(x; α, β, δ) =

δα
exp{βx} K1 (α|x|)
π|x|

With this the characteristic exponent is given by
κ(ξ) = µξ + δ (α2 − β 2 )1/2 − (α2 − (β + ξ)2 )1/2
It is easy to see ([2]) that under the Esscher measure Xt is still a N IG L´evy
process, with the same α, µ, δ but β replaced by

Simulating Jumps from the L´
evy Measure

The L´evy measure ν contains all information about the jumps. If its total mass λ
over IR is ﬁnite, the jump times form a Poisson process with intensity λ and the
jump size distribution is g(dx) = ν(dx)/λ. So, if g can be simulated the path of
a L´evy process can be generated as a compound Poisson process: ﬁrst a random
time grid from an Exp(λ) distribution is drawn and at each grid point we draw
a jump from g.
Since the L´evy measure is allowed to have inﬁnite mass in an open interval
containing zero the compound Poisson method may break down. In Asmussen &
Rosinski [4] it is shown (under certain conditions valid for the N IG case) that
jumps smaller than > 0 may be approximated by a BM with drift and variance
given by,
m( ) = −

x ν(dx),
<|x|<1

v2 ( ) =

x2 ν(dx)

(3)

|x|<

So, the general idea is to use the compound Poisson process method above for
jumps bounded away from zero, say larger than (J> ). To be explicit we use the
notation λ and g . The rest of the jumps, in [− , ] (J< ), is then approximated
by a BM with drift m( ) and variance v 2 ( ).
3.1

Reﬂecting the L´
evy Process

For the Russian option we are interested in the reﬂected (at the supremum)
version Rt of the L´evy process Xt and the hitting time τk of the barrier k, i.e.
Rt = sup Xs − Xt
0≤s≤t

τk = inf{t > 0 : Rt ≥ k}

(4)

In the inﬁnite variation case the small jump approximation is particularly important. Consider the simulation of the running maximum MtX = sup0≤s≤t Xs .
On the random grid generated by the compound Poisson process of the large
jumps J> a maximum between the grid points may be missed. Since there is
an explicit formula for the joint distribution of the BM and its maximum (see
for instance Asmusen, Glynn & Pitman [3] Algorithm B) the small jump approximation make it possible to compensate for this bias. Note also that since J<
may be approximated by the well known BM, this compensation is computable.
This aspect becomes even more important simulating τk . Here we need the
running maximum MtR of Rt , which in turn needs MtX . To update them both
over a grid interval we need the joint distribution the inﬁmum and supremum
of a BM over a compact interval. This is unknown to us and we do the following
approximation. As time evolve MtX and MtR are updated independently over
each of the exponential intervals between the jumps. This should be a very close
approximation since the probability that they both are updated simultaneously
over such an interval is negligible: if Xt is close to MtX , Rt is close to 0, i.e. far
from MtR and vice versa.

The N IG Case

In the paper Asmussen & Rosinski [4] it is explicitly shown that the small jump
approximation is valid. So, the small jumps are given by the equations (3) and
we turn directly to the large jumps.
Using the the asymptote of the Bessel function K1 in Abramowits & Stegun
[1], the corresponding asymptote for the density of the N IG L´evy measure is,
δα

exp{βx} K1 (α|x|) ∼ 2

exp{βx} K1 (α|x|) ∼
ν(x) =
exp{βx − α|x|}
π|x|
|x|3/2

ν(x) =

x → ±∞

These asymptotes give a hint of how to sample from g (x). Consider ﬁrst only
x > (the case x < − is analogous)
In this paper we use an Accept and Reject method with a mixed density
f (x). For x ∈ [ , ω] we use a quadratic density fq (x) and in the tail, x > ω, an
exponential density fe (x) is used.

This choice majorises the density g for the asymptotes x ↓ 0 and x → ∞.

Derivative Prices

To evaluate this simulation algorithm we price some derivatives and see how
they diﬀer from the B&S prices. The derivatives chosen are listed below and in
both cases there exists a closed form pricing formula from the B&S case.
The Barrier Option. We consider the up-in Barrier option (with barrier H)
on the European call option (with strike K). The payoﬀ function is,
ΦB (T ) = (ST − K) 1{ST > K, MTS > H}
where MtS is the running maximum of Ss up to time t.
The Russian Option. The Russian option is a contract that gives the holder
the right to exercise at any ((a.s) ﬁnite) stopping time τ yielding the payoﬀ
ΦR (τ ) = e−ητ max M0 , sup Su ,

M0 ≥ S0 , η > 0

0≤u≤τ

where St is the underlying asset, M0 is the starting maximum and η is the
punish factor. In this paper we use M0 = S0 and vary η.

Some references for the B&S model are Shepp & Shiryaev [14] & [15] and
Duﬃe & Harrison [11]. For the case of a geometric L´evy process see Asmussen, Avram & Pistorius [5]. The computation involve the ﬁrst passage
function,
vk (y) = Ey [exp{−ητk + Rτk }]
which is maximized over k and Rt and τk from equation (4).

Results

We present two studies using this algorithm. The ﬁrst is an evaluation how
important the BM compensation is. Secondly, there is a convergence of the N IG
towards the B&S prices. We try to evaluate the speed for diﬀerent derivatives.

Data

We use the estimations of the Dresdner Bank stock in the paper by Rydberg
[12]. The parameters are,
(α, β, µ, δ) = (68.28, 1.81, 0, 0.01)
Under the Esscher transform β = 0.8653 and to compare with the B&S prices we
need V ar(X1 ) = 1.466 10−4 . The following table shows how the jump intensity
λ( ) (which may be identiﬁed with the computational eﬀort) varies with the
truncation at .

Grid Discretization

In this section we show some results indicating how well the grid compensation
works. The barrier option depends on the hitting of a barrier. In this case it is
only the asset that should hit a barrier. In the Russian option case the reﬂected
process should hit the barrier, which actually involve two diﬀerent running
maximums, i.e. updating M X to get R and M R to update τk .
Barrier option. Here the time to maturity T = 10 and the barrier level
H = 1.055 is ﬁxed and we consider diﬀerent strike prices K and grid intensities,
that is we vary . We present 0.95% conﬁdence intervals where 0.9 U means
upper bound for K = 0.9 for instance. The number of simulations are 2 · 105 .

S. Rasmus, S. Asmussen, and M. Wiktorsson

The conclusion we make is that the truncation works well for < 10−3 .
Without compensation however, it looks like we need < 2 · 10−4 that is, about
6 times as much computer time, c.f. the Table 1 above. Smaller give similar
conﬁdence bands as = 10−4 both with or without grid compensation.

implies τk ∼ 10. Again we present 0.95% conﬁdence intervals for the case with

Convergence to B&S Prices

Since the variance of the N IG variable is ﬁnite, Donsker’s Theorem
XtT − atT
√
b2 T

t≥0

→ Bt as T → ∞

suggests that N IG and the B&S prices are not too far if the time horizon is
large. In this section we give some examples quantifying this.
Barrier option. The closeness measure used in the Barrier option case is
Q(K) =

Π B&S (K)
Π N IG (K)

Since we assume that S0 = 1, K represent the moneyness in the option.
Note that for T = 2 is Q < 1 for all K and close to 1 at T = 4 for K small.
For larger T will Q grow (see T = 30) and then tend to 1 for all K ∈ [0.9, 1.05]
(T = 80) as we expected.

The conclusion here is that the relative price quotient above S0 = 1 decreases
for smaller punish factor, that is longer time horizon.
