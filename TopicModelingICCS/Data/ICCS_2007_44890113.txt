Abstract. Discretization of boundary integral equations leads, in general, to
fully populated nonsymmetric linear systems of equations. We research the
comparative performances of iterative techniques based on Krylov subspace
solvers as GMRES(m), QMR and Bi-CGStab solving linear systems arising
from BEM elasticity problems. Several general preconditioners are also
considered and assessed. The results of numerical experiments suggest that
preconditioned Krylov subspace methods are effective approaches for the
solution of dense nonsymmetric linear systems arising from BEM.
Keywords: Krylov Subspace Method; Preconditioner; Dense Nonsymmetric
Matrix; Boundary Element Method.

1 Introduction
The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is an important technique in the numerical
solution of engineering or scientific problems. The matrix of the system in the BEM is
fully populated and nonsymmetric. A fast convergent iterative solution method, which
would require the number of iterations much less than the number of DOF, will
decrease the computational cost to O( N 2 ) [1]. The Krylov subspace iterative
methods are efficient methods in solving the linear systems arising from BEM
formulation [2-4]. On the other hand, the systems obtained from the discretization
step are badly conditioned, especially when mixed boundary conditions exist or large
scale problems. Thereby, preconditioning is very essential to the successful use of
Krylov subspace iterative methods. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the
efficient solution of dense nonsymmetric systems arising from BEM elasticity
problems by preconditioned Krylov subspace methods.

2 Preconditioned Krylov Subspace Methods
We are concerned with the solution of dense nonsymmetric linear systems Ax = b
arising from BEM formulation. In this paper, three of the most widely used Krylov
subspace methods (GMRES, QMR, Bi-CGStab) are considered. Briefly, starting with
an initial guess x0 , iterates xi ∈ x0 + K i ( A, r0 ) are produced such that the residuals

ri = b − Axi are in some sense small [4]. The Krylov subspace is defined as

K m ( A, r0 ) = span {r0 , Ar0 , A2 r0 ," , Am −1 r0 }

Note that these subspaces are nested, i.e. K m ⊆ K m +1 .
It is well known that the rate of convergence of an iterative method depends greatly
on the spectral properties of coefficient matrix. Hence, iterative methods usually
involve a matrix that transforms the original coefficient matrix into one having the
same solution but more favorable spectral properties. A preconditioner is a matrix that
can be used to accomplish such a transformation.
M −1 Ax = M −1b

(2)

In practice, the preconditioner should meet the requirement of two characteristics.
First, the preconditioned matrix M −1 A must be (much) better conditioned than A so
that Eq.(2) can be efficiently solved by iterative methods. Secondly, the cost of
constructing and applying preconditioner must be cheap. However, the two
requirements are contradicting, so there is a trade-off between the cost of constructing
and applying the preconditioner, and the improvement of iterative efficiency.

3 Numerical Examples
The experiments with different krylov subspace methods are performed using the
iterative solver written in Fortran90 and compiled by Compaq Visual Fortran 6.5. All
experiments are performed on a PC with 1GB RAM memory under Windows XP
Professional. The computer is equipped with a 2.8GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor and
no special software optimization or specialized hardware. A convenient stopping
criteria is used the stopping criteria i > maxit or r ( i ) ≤ ε ⋅ b .
Example 1: In this section, we solve the same numerical problem using different
preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. The number of DOF is 1806. The initial
guess is the zero vector. The convergence histories of Krylov subspace methods are
depicted in Figs. 1-3 for different preconditioning techniques gives us some clues as
to the numerical behaviors of the proposed schemes. In these figures “JOBI” means
Jacobi preconditioning, “BJOB” means Block Jacobi preconditioning, “ILU3” and
“ILU5” mean Incomplete LU Factorization Preconditioning with Tri-diagonal and
Five-diagonal nonzero structure, respectively.
From these figures, it can be seen that the convergence velocity of Krylov subspace
methods can be significantly improved by using the preconditioning techniques. The
residual of Jacobi preconditioned Krylov subspace methods tends to decrease very
rapidly compared with the ILU preconditioning techniques. Among these Krylov
subspace methods, the residues of GMRES methods decrease monotonically and
rapidly with the increasing iteration number, the convergence behaviors of other
methods are quite irregular, and may even break down.
Example 2: In this section, we choose the three methods to calculate different DOFs
of BEM problem. In table 1, we describe the results of experiments on an elasticity

From the table 1, it can be seen that the performance of GMRES(30) is superior to
other iterative methods. On the other hand, we can find that the iteration number
increases slowly with the number of DOFs, and the iteration number is fairly small
relative to the number of unknowns.

4 Conclusions
Base on the results of numerical experiments we conclude that preconditioned krylov
subspace methods are effective solvers for the solution of large scale dense
nonsymmetric linear systems. The preconditioning is indispensable to improving the
iterative efficiency of large scale problems. There is a trade-off between the cost of
the constructing and applying the preconditioner, and the gain of convergence speed.
