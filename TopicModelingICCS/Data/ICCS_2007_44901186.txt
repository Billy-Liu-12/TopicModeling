Abstract. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with
constriction factor approach (CFA) is proposed to optimal hydro generators
governor Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) gains for small hydraulic transients. And four different integral performance criteria of turbine speed deviation such as integrated absolute error (IAE), integral of time weighted absolute
value of error (ITAE), integral of squared error (ISE) and integral of time
weighted squared error (ITSE) have been taken as fitness function respectively,
and the differences have been investigated and compared. A step speed disturbance test on no-load operation has been performed. The digital simulation
results show that the proposed PSO method has stable convergence characteristic and good computational ability, and it can effectively optimal hydro generators governor PID gains. And the dynamic performance of hydro generators
governor system for small hydraulic transients is much better if ITAE criterion
is applied as fitness function.
Keywords: Particle swarm optimization; Constriction factor approach; Integral

1 Introduction
In modern hydroelectric power plants, conventional PID controller is widely applied in
hydro generators governor systems [1]. There are any methods have been reported for
improving the setting performance of hydro generators governor system parameters,
such as simplex method, orthogonal test method, genetic algorithm (GA) and so on [2].
However, these methods have different disadvantages. Particle swarm optimization
(PSO) is characterized as a simple concept, easy to implement, and computationally
efficient [3]. In fact, PSO has obtained more and more attentions in the researching
areas of electric power systems [4]-[5]. In this paper, the PSO algorithm with constriction factor approach (CFA-PSO) [6] is proposed to optimal hydro generators governor
PID gains for small hydraulic transients. And four different integral performance criteria
of turbine speed deviation such as IAE, ITAE, ISE and ITSE have been taken as fitness
function respectively, and the differences have been investigated and compared.

2 Hydro Generators Governor System
The typical hydro generators governor system is shown in Fig. 1, which consists of
PID controller, electro-hydraulic servo system, hydro turbine system, generator and
load. The definitions of the parameters, in Fig. 1, could be found in [1].

Governor System
The velocity of the kth dimension of the ith particle is updated in current iteration
cycle ( t + 1 ) in CFA-PSO can be expressed as:

Vi , k (t + 1) = χ(Vi , k (t ) + c1 r1 ( Pi , k (t ) − X i , k (t )) + c 2 r2 ( Pg , k (t ) − X i , k (t )))

(1)

And the position of the kth dimension of the ith particle is updated as:
X i , k (t + 1) = X i , k (t ) + Vi , k (t + 1)

(2)

The definitions of the parameters of CFA-PSO could be found in [6]. Usually, c1
and c 2 are set as c1 = c 2 = 2.05 , thus, χ = 0.729 .

A PID controller optimized with the CFA-PSO algorithm was developed, which was
called PSO-PID controller. The integral performance criteria (IAE, or ITAE, or ISE, or
ITSE criteria) of turbine speed deviation x must be minimized by CFA-PSO algorithm.
The CFA-PSO algorithm for the PID gains optimizing was implemented using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 programming language on a PC with Intel Pentium III 1GHz processor. The population size of CFA-PSO algorithm is 15 and the maximum allowable
number of iterations is 30. The data of hydro generators governor system are given in
Table 1, the time step of the simulation for small hydraulic transients is 0.02 sec, the

simulation is done for 30 sec, and the lower and upper bounds of PID gains are all set as
[0, 10]. The optimizing processes have been done off-line.

A 10% step turbine speed deviation increasing was applied to the turbine speed reference, i.e., c = 0.1 . Since all the four integral performance criteria of turbine speed
deviation x have been taken as fitness function respectively, thus, there have four
different optimal PID gains sets, shown in Table 2. From the simulations results, it

could be found that if ITAE criterion was taken as fitness function, hydro generators
governor system will get the smallest overshoot, i.e., M p = 0.102 , and the shortest
settling time, i.e., t s = 11.717 sec .The traces of the best fitness convergence of the
four integral performance criteria are shown in Fig. 2. It could be found that all of the
optimizing processes have downward trends and are convergence in not more than 30
iterations. The fastest one is ITAE criterion was taken as fitness function, which is not
more than 16 iterations, and the slowest one is ITSE criteria was taken as fitness function, which is not more than 29 iterations. And Fig. 3 shows the turbine speed deviation response traces using the four different optimal PID gains sets. It is clear that the
hydro generators governor system has the best dynamic performance if ITAE criterion
was applied as fitness function than that of IAE, ISE and ITSE criterion.
