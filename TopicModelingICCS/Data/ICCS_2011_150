Abstract
We consider the problem of time-stepping/sampling for molecular and meso-scale particle dynamics. The aim
of the work is to derive numerical time-stepping methods that generate samples exactly from the desired target temperature distribution. The numerical methods proposed in this paper rely on the well-known splitting of stochastic
thermostat equations into conservative and ﬂuctuation-dissipation parts. We propose a methodology to derive numerical approximation to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation part that exactly samples from the underlying Boltzmann distribution.
Our methodology applies to Langevin dynamics as well as Dissipative Particle Dynamics and, more generally, to arbitrary position dependent ﬂuctuation-dissipation terms. A Metropolis criterion is introduced to correct for numerical
inconsistency in the conservative dynamics part of the model. Shadow energies are used to increase the acceptance
rate under the Metropolis criterion. We call the newly proposed method meso-GSHMC.
Keywords: Dissipative Particle Dynamics; Monte Carlo methods; constant temperature simulation

1. Introduction
Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of all-atoms or coarse grained systems are among the most popular techniques for simulation of soft matter. Classical MD simulations are naturally performed under the conditions of
constant energy E, constant volume V, and constant number of particles N. One refers to such simulations as microcanonical or NV E ensemble simulations [1, 2]. In addition to energy, volume and number of particles, microcanonical
ensemble simulations also conserve linear and angular momentum, with the later not being a constant under periodic
boundary conditions. Unfortunately, the microcanonical (NV E) ensemble does not correspond to the conditions under
which most experiments are carried out. If one is interested in the behavior of the system at a speciﬁc temperature
T , a constant NVT ensemble simulation using a thermostat is required. See, for example, [1, 2] for a description of
popular thermostats. In this paper, we focus on stochastic thermostats (e.g., the Andersen thermostat, Langevin and
Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)) and their numerical implementation since these methods appear to be robust
and accurate in a wide range of applications [1, 2].
Note that local thermostats, such as Langevin dynamics and DPD, can be viewed as simpliﬁed reduced systems
in the sense of Mori-Zwanzig reduction (see, for example, [1]). This aspect is particularly important for coarse

grained models for which the ﬂuctuation-dissipation contributions should not only keep the system at a desired target
temperature but should also mimic the impact of non-resolved ﬁner details of an all-atom model on the coarse grained
length and time scales. Under those circumstances, the appropriate numerical treatment of ﬂuctuation-dissipation
terms also gains in importance.
The numerical methods proposed in this paper rely on the well-known splitting of stochastic thermostat equations
into a conservative and a ﬂuctuation-dissipation part [1]. We propose a methodology to derive numerical approximation to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation part that exactly samples from the underlying Boltzmann distribution. Our
methodology applies to Langevin dynamics as well as DPD and, more generally, to arbitrary position dependent
ﬂuctuation-dissipation terms. A composition method approach is used to derive a time-stepping method for the complete thermostat, where the conservative dynamics part is discretized by the standard St¨ormer-Verlet method [1, 3].
A Metropolis criterion is introduced to correct for inconsistency in the St¨ormer-Verlet time-stepping method with the
underlying NVT ensemble and puts the resulting propagator into the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods [4]. Our approach relies essentially on an appropriate adaptation of the generalized hybrid Monte Carlo
method of [5, 6]. Acceptance rates under the Metropolis criterion can be increased using shadow energies as demonstrated in the work of [7, 8]. The proposed methods are applicable to meso-scale and coarse grained molecular
dynamics simulations which require a highly accurate sampling from the given target NVT ensemble.
Following [8], the techniques proposed in this paper can be combined with constant temperature T , pressure P,
and number of particles N (NPT ) ensemble simulation techniques such as proposed by [9, 10].
An outline of the paper is as follows. The stochastic equations of second-order Langevin and dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) are summarized in Section 2. We also provide a summary of state of the art numerical methods for
stochastic thermostats and discuss shadow energies [11, 3] for conservative time-stepping methods such as St¨ormerVerlet. Numerical methods which exactly sample from the velocity Boltzmann distribution for force-free motion are
proposed in Section 3, where we also discuss their composition with the St¨ormer-Verlet method for conservative dynamics. Since the composed approximation does not exactly sample from the NVT ensemble, a Metropolis corrected
implementation, based on the generalized shadow hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method [8], is proposed in Section 4. The new method is called meso-GSHMC. Numerical results for a standard DPD test case as well as from a
membrane protein simulation are provided in Section 5. Concluding remarks can be found in Section 6.
We ﬁnally mention that Monte Carlo methods such as meso-GSHMC can be put into the context of massively
parallel computing. A ﬁrst approach is to use massively parallel implementations of the necessary force ﬁeld calculations. A second application arises when Monte Carlo chains are conducted in parallel and independently. More
parallelization strategies appear as reﬁnements of this trivial (but often very useful) exploitation of parallelism. Such
reﬁnements include parallel tempering/replica exchange and orientational bias Monte Carlo [4].
2. Summary of local stochastic thermostat formulations
We consider an N-atom molecular system with atomistic positions ri = (xi , yi , zi )T ∈ R3 , velocities vi = (ui , vi , wi )T ∈
R , masses mi , momenta pi = mi vi ∈ R3 , potential energy function V, and total energy function

2.1. Langevin and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)
DPD has become a very popular method for meso-scale simulations of materials. In this section, we provide a
short summary of the method and discuss a slightly more general framework that also includes traditional Langevin
dynamics. Following the notation of [12], the standard DPD method of [13] can be formulated as a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE):

(3)

j i

where ri j = ri − r j , ri j = |ri − r j |, ei j = ri j /ri j , vi j = vi − v j , and Fi = −∇ri V(r) is the conservative force acting on
particle i. The dimensionless weight function ω(r) can be chosen in a rather arbitrary manner. However, to reproduce
a constant temperature ensemble, the friction coeﬃcient γ and the noise amplitude σ have to satisfy the ﬂuctuation
dissipation relation σ = 2kB T γ. Here kB denotes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, Wi j (t) = W ji (t) are independent
Wiener processes [14]. Recall that the ﬁnite-time increments
ΔWi j (τ) = Wi j (t + τ) − Wi j (t) of a Wiener process are
√
Gaussian distributed with mean zero and variance τ, i.e., ΔWi j (τ) ∼ N(0, τ), where N(a, b) denotes the Gaussian
distribution with mean a and variance b.
Following [15], let us write the equations (3) in a more compact and general manner:
K

dr = M −1 p dt,

dp = −∇r V(r) dt −

∇r hk (r) γh˙ k (r) dt − σ dWk ,

(4)

k=1

where

h˙ k (r) = ∇r hk (r) · v = ∇r hk (r) · M −1 p,

(5)

and the functions hk (r), k = 1, . . . , K, can be chosen quite arbitrarily. The choice hk (r) = φ(ri j ), φ (r) = ω (r),
k = 1, . . . , K, with K = (N − 1)N/2 in (4) leads back to the standard DPD model. However, one can also set K = 3N
and derive the standard Langevin model.
An intriguing aspect of the DPD equations (3) is that they satisfy Newton’s third law which implies conservation
of total linear and angular momentum. The same is not true for Langevin dynamics. Conservation of total linear
and angular momentum has made DPD a popular method for meso-scale simulations (see, e.g., [16]) as well as a
stochastic thermostat for NVT simulations [17].

2.2. State of the art numerical treatment
Appropriate time-stepping methods for the conservative part (2) form the basis of any time-stepping methods
for stochastic thermostats. It seems that there is widespread agreement that the conservative part should be solved
numerically by the St¨ormer-Verlet method, which is written here in the velocity/momentum formulation:
pn+1/2 = pn −

rn+1 = rn + ΔtM−1 pn+1/2 ,

pn+1 = pn+1/2 −

Δt
∇r V(rn+1 ),

(6)

where Δt is the step size. The method was ﬁrst used in the context of MD by Verlet [18] and has been very popular
with the MD community since [1].
Why is the St¨ormer-Verlet method so successful for constant energy MD simulations? Several reasons can be
given. The method is easy to implement, it exactly conserves total linear and angular momentum, it is time-reversible,
it conserves volume of phase space Ω = R3N , and the total energy (1) is very well conserved over long simulation
times even for large and complex systems. Near conservation of energy is due to the existence of shadow energies
which are preserved to much higher order than the method itself. See [11, 3] for a detailed theoretical exploration
of this phenomena. An explicit algorithm for computing shadow (also called modiﬁed) energies along numerically
computed trajectories can be found in [19]. In an numerical experiment we demonstrate conservation of energy under
the St¨ormer-Verlet method applied to the microcanonical equations (2). For simplicity, we consider a one-dimensional
period chain of N = 10 particles with interacting through a pair-wise Lennard-Jones potential. Relative changes in
the numerical values of the energy (1) as well as fourth and eighth-order shadow energies from [19], respectively, can
be found in Fig 1. Shadow energies can be used, for example, to assess the quality of NV E ensemble simulations [20]

Figure 1: Displayed are relative changes in the total energy and fourth and eighth-order shadow energies as a function of the step-size Δt. Simulations are performed with the St¨ormer-Verlet method for a one-dimensional chain of Lennard-Jones particles. The slope of the graphs correctly
reﬂects the order of the method and its shadow energies for suﬃciently small step-sizes

and to increase the acceptance rate in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on molecular dynamics proposal
steps [21, 7, 8].
While St¨ormer-Verlet is the gold standard for MD NV E simulations, the optimal numerical treatment of the DPD
equations (3), on the other hand, is still a subject of debate. See, for example, [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 17, 30].
For a comparison of several numerical algorithms for DPD see [26, 27]. In particular, it is found that the numerically
observed temperature T ∗ depends on the step-size Δt and diﬀers from the target temperature T . Methods are now
available that lead to T ∗ = T in the absence of conservative forces [23, 28, 17, 30]. However, none of the existing
methods leads to T ∗ = T under the full DPD dynamics.
3. A splitting approach for stochastic thermostats
In this section, we develop a general framework for numerical implementation of stochastic thermostats. The
approach is based on a splitting of the stochastic diﬀerential equation into an energy conserving part and a ﬂuctuationdissipation part. This splitting is used since each part separately conserves the canonical distribution

under its analytically generated Markov processes.
3.1. Treatment of ﬂuctuation-dissipation part
While splitting methods have been discussed in the context of stochastic diﬀerential equations before (see, for
example, [31, 32, 33, 25, 34, 30, 35]), we propose to use simpliﬁed numerical methods for the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
contributions which, however, exactly conserve the momentum Boltzmann distribution [1]. We next describe these
methods in the context of DPD and consider the DPD-type force free momentum dynamics

for ﬁxed position vector r. Note that (8) constitutes a linear SDE. Again the goal is to devise numerical approximations

as a generating diﬀerential equation for the ﬂuctuation-dissipation part of the general DPD formulation (4). The initial
Rk (0) are Gaussian random numbers with mean zero and variance kB T , i.e. Rk (0) ∼ N(0, kB T ) for i = 1, . . . , K. We
introduce the notation R = (R1 , . . . , RK )T .
To obtain a numerical momentum update step, we seek the solution at s = 2γΔt for given initial conditions
p(0) = pn , Rk (0) = Rnk = N(0, kB T ), k = 1, . . . , K. Let us denote the linear solution operator, generated by the
solutions of (9), by R(s) ∈ R(3N+K)×(3N+K) . The solution operator R(s) has the following properties [3]: (a) the
solutions of (9) are volume conserving, i.e., det R(s) = 1; (b) given a ﬁxed position vector r, the solutions of (9) are
time reversible, i.e., F R(s) F = R(−s). Here F denotes the linear involution operator that changes the sign of all
Rk ’s, k = 1, . . . , K; (c) the solutions of (9) conserve the extended Hamiltonian/energy
1
(10)
Ec = E + RT R;
2
(d) properties (a) and (c) immediately imply that the solutions of (9) conserve the extended canonical distribution
πc (p, R) ∝ e−βEc .

(11)

We now consider the numerical implementation of (9). To do so we follow the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)
methodology [36, 37] and consider time-reversible and volume conserving propagators for the dynamics in p and R
with ﬁxed position vector r. Two such methods will be considered: (i) an explicit one, which does not conserve (10),
and (ii) an implicit one, which does conserve (10).
St¨ormer-Verlet method. A ﬁrst choice is provided by the application of the St¨ormer-Verlet method to (9) over J
internal steps with internal step-size Δs = 2γΔt/J and we obtain

(15)

In case of rejection, we continue with the initial pn ; i.e., in case of rejection we have pn+1 = pn . Otherwise we set
pn+1 = p . In line with the standard HMC method, the vector R is entirely discarded after each completed momentum
update step.
Note that the acceptance probability r → 1 as Δs → 0. This follows from the convergence of the numerical
propagator to the exact R(s) as Δs → 0. Hence, as a rule of thumb, we suggest to pick J large enough such that the
rejection rate in (15) becomes negligible (e.g., less than 1%) for given s = 2γΔt.
Implicit midpoint rule. An alternative propagator is obtained by applying the implicit midpoint rule (see, e.g., [3])
to (9) over a single step with step-size Δs = 2γΔt and we obtain

The resulting linear equations in (p , R ) can be solved by a simple ﬁxed point iteration or some other iterative solver.
Since only matrix vector multiplications are involved and the matrices involved are typically very sparse, such iterative
methods can be implemented eﬃciently especially on parallel computers.

An appealing aspect of the implementation (16)-(17) is that it conserves the extended energy (10) exactly and,
hence, also the corresponding canonical distribution function (11). Since the method also conserves volume and is
time-reversible, the proposed momenta p are always accepted, while the vector R is entirely discarded after each
momentum update step.
Because of the necessary ﬁxed point iteration, the implicit midpoint method (16)-(17) is more expensive than the
St¨ormer-Verlet method ((12)-(14). However, we nevertheless recommend the implicit midpoint method because of
the ideal acceptance probability r = 1.
3.2. Treatment of conservative part
Since the St¨ormer-Verlet method does not conserve energy exactly, it also does not conserve the canonical distribution (7). Hence, in the context of our splitting method, we need to correct the St¨ormver-Verlet discretization of the
conservative part of the dynamics such that the canonical distribution (7) is preserved. This is essentially the approach
taken by the generalized hybrid Monte Carlo (GHMC) method of [5, 6]. To make GHMC applicable to DPD type
stochastic thermostats, we combine the newly proposed momentum updates (Section 3.1) with a Metropolis acceptance/rejection criterions for the conservative dynamics update. Furthermore, to increase the acceptance rate in the
conservative dynamics part of GHMC we utilize the idea of shadow energies as employed by the generalized shadow
hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method [8]. The details are described in the following section. We call the resulting
method meso-GSHMC.
4. The meso-GSHMC method
In this section, we demonstrate how to extend the GHMC methodology to DPD-type momentum updates such
that the resulting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method samples exactly from the canonical distribution (7).
The key idea of the generalized shadow hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method of [8] is to assess the Monte Carlo
steps of GHMC with regard to a shadow Hamiltonian EΔt , which increases the acceptance rate in the conservative
dynamics part of GHMC. A shadow energy can either be found using the methods of [7, 8] or [19].
We now outline the meso-GSHMC method. While the conservative dynamcis part of meso-GSHMC is identical
to the approach described in [8] for GSHMC, we need to reconsider the momentum refreshment step.
4.1. Momentum refreshment step
When using shadow energies, we need to modify the partial momentum update step, as deﬁned by (16)-(17) (in
case of the implicit midpoint implementation). More speciﬁcally, given a shadow energy EΔt , the key idea is to replace
the extended canonical density (11) by
⎛
⎜⎜
π(r, p, R) ∝ exp ⎜⎜⎜⎝−βEΔt (r, p) − β/2

(18)

k=1

and the acceptance probability (15) by
r = min 1,

π(r, p , R )
.
π(r, p, R)

(19)

Recall that if EΔt = E, then r = 1 for the implicit midpoint implementation (16)-(17).
Since the meso-GSHMC method samples with respect to a modiﬁed canonical ensemble, it is necessary to reweight the computed samples {Ω j } of an observable Ω = Ω(r, p). See [7, 8] and the algorithmic summary below for
details.
4.2. Meso-GSHMC: Algorithmic summary
The meso-GSHMC method is deﬁned through an energy/Hamiltonian (1), a shadow energy EΔt , inverse temperK
, friction constant γ, time-step Δt, and number of
ature β = 1/kB T , a set of position-dependent functions {hk (r)}k=1
j
time-steps L. The method generates a sequence of states Γ , j = 1, . . . , J. We now summarize a single step of the
meso-GSHMC method.

(i) Conservative dynamics step. Given the last accepted state Γ j with a pair of position and momentum vectors
(r, p), we numerically integrate the Hamiltonian equations of motion (2) over L time-steps with the St¨ormerVerlet method (6), step-size Δt, and initial conditions r0 = r, p0 = p. This results in the approximation (rL , pL ).

Using the implicit midpoint rule implementation of the momentum refreshment step, the system (16)-(17) is
solved for (p , R ) by ﬁxed point iteration and initial momentum p = p¯ and ﬁxed position r = r¯ . The accepted
momentum vector p is obtained via the Metropolis criterion

where w j = exp β EΔt (Γ j ) − E(Γ j ) .
4.3. Remarks
It should be noted that the Metropolis criterion (20) leads to a trajectory reversal upon rejection of the conservative
dynamics proposal step; i.e., the method continues with the previous position vector r0 and negated momentum vector
p0 upon rejection of the proposal step. While this trajectory reversal is required for detailed balance with respect to
the canonical distribution (7) it also implies that rejections interfere strongly with the dynamics. It has been proposed
by [38] to replace (20) by
¯ =
(¯r, p)

(rL , pL )
(r0 , p0 )

with probability min(1, exp(−β δE))
.
otherwise

(25)

Unfortunately, detailed balance does no longer holds under (25) [39]. However, it has been demonstrated for simple
test problems that (25) increases the sampling accuracy and interferes less with the dynamics of the stochastic thermostats than (20) [38, 39]. See also [40] for related results on Metropolis corrected stochastic Nos´e-Hoover dynamics
[41]. In this paper, we implement meso-GHMC with the Metropolis criterion (20) to demonstrate exact sampling
from the canonical distribution (7).
We emphasize that meso-GSHMC can also be implemented with the shadow energy being the original energy (1).
In this case, it is more appropriate to call the resulting Monte Carlo method meso-GHMC.

5.1. DPD test system
Numerical results from the meso-GHMC/GSHMC methods are compared to the MD-VV implementation [26]
of DPD. Numerical experiments are conducted for Model C of [26]. For the chosen units, we have kB T = 1 in
dimensionless variables. Model C is a simple interacting Lennard-Jones ﬂuid with truncated pairwise interaction

with rc = 1 and l = 2−1/6 . The simulation box is of size 16×16×16 with a total of N = 2867 particles. This corresponds
to a density of ρ = 0.7. The conservative dynamics part is implemented with τ = 0.05 and varying values for Δt and,
hence, L = τ/Δt, while the momentum refreshment step is implemented with Δs = (2γτ)1/2 ≈ 4.4721 in (16)-(17)
with γ = 200 (σ = 20, respectively).
The meso-GSHMC method is implemented with a fourth-order accurate shadow energy EΔt which is calculated
in the numerical experiments using the approach of [8]. Note that the truncated interaction potential (26) leads to a
continuous only force ﬁeld. Higher regularity of the force ﬁelds is required to achieve a fourth-order accuracy in the
shadow energy. The fourth-order behavior is indeed not observed in our numerical experiments. See [29] for the use
of smoother truncation schemes in the context of DPD. The reference experiments with the standard DPD method of
[26] use the same parameter settings.

and the newly proposed meso-GHMC/GSHMC methods. The correct result is kB T = 1. We also display the temperature obtained from the
proposed splitting approach, where the non-conservation of energy under the St¨ormer-Verlet method is not corrected by a Metropolis accept/reject
step

We conﬁrm in Fig 2 that the newly proposed meso-GSHMC/GHMC methods reproduce the target value kB T = 1
under the full dynamics. We also ﬁnd that the splitting approach of Section 3 without Metropolis correction leads to a
drift in temperature due to the non-conservation of the canonical distribution (7) under the St¨ormer-Verlet discretization of the conservative dynamics part of DPD.
5.2. Membrane protein
Meso-scale simulations techniques are increasingly applied to problems from biophysical chemistry such as the
interaction of macromolecules with the interface between an aqueous solution and biological membranes; i.e., phospholipid bilayer. These simulations are based on coarse-grained (CG) approaches which replace the all atom classical
mechanics force-ﬁelds of traditional molecular dynamics. As an example we mention the studies of [42, 43, 44] on CG
simulations of simple peptides and integral membranes interacting with a lipid bilayer. In addition to ﬁnding more

accurate CG force ﬁelds, there also remains the need to improve accuracy and eﬃciency of sampling to guarantee
convergence of CG simulations. Since CG simulations are typically performed in a NVT ensemble setting, stochastic
thermostats such as those considered in this paper can be applied. A comparison between standard constant temperature CG-MD simulations using a Berendsen thermostat with the GSHMC method, as described in this paper, has been
conducted in [45]. The test application is a gating-modiﬁer peptide toxin in a membrane with environment. See [45]
for a detailed description of the model system, simulation set-up, and numerical results. In Fig 3, the evolution of
the toxin is shown from an initial position within the membrane to its preferred position at the surface of the bilayer.
The GSHMC method leads to a much more rapid repositioning of the toxin compared to a CG-MD simulation with
Berendsen thermostat.

Figure 3: Displayed is the evolution of peptide toxin from an initial position within the membrane to its preferred position at the surface of the
membrane. More speciﬁcally, the distance of the toxin to an energy minimized reference position at the surface of the membrane is shown for a
CG-MD and a GSHMC simulation. While both simulation methods correctly identify the preferred location of the toxin, the toxin equilibrates
much faster under the GSHMC simulation

6. Concluding remarks
In this paper, we have investigated local stochastic thermostats such as Langevin and dissipative particle dynamics.
We have proposed simple modiﬁcations to existing methods which sample exactly from the Boltzmann distribution for
position-dependent ﬂuctuation-dissipation terms and force free motion. Alternative methods with the same property
have been proposed in the past but rely on a splitting into pairwise interactions [23, 25, 28, 17] and can therefore
not easily be applied to very large systems. As another novel contribution, we have also shown how to put stochastic
thermostats with position-dependent ﬂuctuation-dissipation terms, for example DPD, within the framework of Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods which implies rigorous sampling from the canonical distribution (7) regardless of the
chosen step-size Δt. We have veriﬁed this property numerically for Model C from [26]. We have also demonstrated
for a membrane protein system that Metropolis corrected time-stepping methods are eﬃcient for applications which
require a careful and rapid equilibration with respect to a given target temperature.
The proposed methods can be viewed as Metropolis corrected time-stepping methods similar to the HMC scheme
for ﬁrst-order Brownian dynamics. However, it should be noted that the Metropolis test induces non-trivial changes
to the dynamics in case of rejection of the proposal step. A possible compromise between sampling accuracy and
reduced interference with dynamics is to remove the momentum reversal upon rejection in (20), respectively, from the
meso-GHMC/GSHMC methods and to use a Metropolis test of type (25). See [38, 39] for some initial results, which
indicate that GHMC/GSHMC without momentum ﬂip improves the accuracy of standard time-stepping methods
while interfering little with dynamic properties such as autocorrelation functions provided the acceptance rate is kept
suﬃciently high. This aspect requires further investigations.
