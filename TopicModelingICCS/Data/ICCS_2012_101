Abstract
Understanding and characterizing sources of uncertainty in climate modeling is an important task. Because of
the ever increasing sophistication and resolution of climate modeling it is increasing important to develop uncertainty
quantiﬁcation methods that minimize the computational cost that occurs when these methods are added to climate
modeling. This research explores the application of sparse stochastic collocation with polynomial edge detection to
characterize portions of the probability space associated with the Earth’s radiative budget in the Community Earth
System Model (CESM). Speciﬁcally, we develop surrogate models with error estimates for a range of acceptable
input parameters that predict statistical values of the Earth’s radiative budget as derived from the CESM simulation.
Keywords: Climate modeling, Uncertainty quantiﬁcation, Error estimation

1. Introduction
Global Climate Models (GCMs) are a key tool available to scientist that can simulate any proposed future climate
scenario. Building reliable and computationally eﬀective uncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ) methods that can accurately
capture the uncertainty in GCM is an essential part of maximizing the scientiﬁc information that can be obtained
from these models. Stochastic modeling is the widely adopted approach for conducting UQ, and within this approach,
the stochastic collocation method [1, 2, 3] has particular properties that make it an attractive choice for estimating
UQ in GCMs. One of the key properties that make the stochastic collocation method suitable for GCM is that the
implementation of this method allows the GCM to be treated as a ’black-block’, uncertainty quantiﬁcation is solely
achieved by only considering the inputs and outputs of the GCM. There is no intrusive requirements to the GCM
that would force the GCM code-base to be modiﬁed to achieve the goal of uncertainty quantiﬁcation. The other
key property of the stochastic collocation method is that adaptive algorithms [4, 5, 6, 7] have been developed that
signiﬁcantly reduce the computational cost of characterizing the uncertainty of computational simulations.

Figure 1: The ﬁgure represents short-wave radiation in red reﬂecting oﬀ the cloud or passing through the cloud, and long-wave radiation in blue
irradiating from the Earth’s surface. The cloud absorbs the long-wave radiation and re-emits this radiation towards Earth’s surface or space.

This study adapts the local edge detection method developed for multiple dimensions [8] to provide error estimation in the stochastic collocation methods characterization of the Earth’s radiative budget in the Community Earth
System Model (CESM)[9]. This method provides a unique and accurate error estimate that is based on high order
detection of function smoothness. The combination of stochastic collocation with error estimation provides a measure
of the accuracy of the approximation of the entire stochastic space. For this study we focus on characterizing the
uncertainty of particular componets of radiative budget in the CESM. The radiative budget is the balance between
outgoing and incoming radiation. Clouds, a major regulator of Earth’s radiative budget, interfere with long-wave
and short-wave radiation [10]. Clouds only form when a critical threshold of relative humidity known as the relative minimum humidity (rhmin) is surpassed. The rhmin for the formation of low level clouds (rhminl) diﬀers from
the rhmin for the formation of middle to high level clouds (rhminh). In this paper, uncertainty and the probability
space are mapped with the aforementioned methods for a distribution of rhminl and rhminh. We also provide global
error estimates of the approximated probability space, thereby providing a greater characterization of the uncertainty
quantiﬁcation for the radiative budget with respect to the relative minimum humidity.
2. Background
2.1. Description of the studied probability space
The Community Earth System Model (CESM)[9] was created to produce complex simulations of climate by
parallel computations through collaboration with various working groups, universities, national labs, and the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The CESM encompasses the atmosphere, ocean, land, land-ice, and seaice sub-models and a coupler that allows these sub-models to share data. Developed by the Atmospheric Model
Working Group (AMWG), Chemistry Climate Working Group, national labs, and Whole Atmosphere Working Group,
the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) is a fully coupled general circulation model.
One of the focuses of CAM is to model the radiative budget. Shown in Figure 1, clouds regulate long wave and
short wave radiation by absorbing and emitting the radiation in W/m2 to the Earths surface or by reﬂecting the radiation
back into space [10]. Clouds predominately reﬂect short-wave radiation to the top-of-atmosphere, the outer surface

space in steps A through D.

of the atmosphere, but some of this radiation passes through the clouds arriving at the Earth’s surface. This process
is called Short-wave Cloud Forcing (SWCF). Outgoing short-wave radiation is measured at the top-of-atmosphere.
The Surface Long-wave Downwelling Flux (FLDS) and the Surface Short-wave Downwelling Flux (FSDS) refer to
the radiation that reaches the soil surface of the Earth from clouds. The Long-wave Net Surface Flux (FLNS) is the
diﬀerence between outgoing radiation irradiated by the Earth’s surface and incoming radiation emitted by clouds. In
CAM, clouds are largely based on the Zhang and McFarlane deep convection parameterization scheme [11] and the
parameters rhminl and rhminh aﬀect the fraction of clouds formed in each grid cell. Figure 2 is a depiction of the
‘black-box’ approach to characterizing the probability space associated with rhminl and rhminh.
2.2. Stochastic collocation method with error estimation
The particular stochastic collocation method used in this study is know as Generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)
[2]. We demonstrate at the end of this section how the polynomial annihilation method [8] can be adapted for error
estimation of gPC. We begin with a review of the basic ideas behind gPC.
Let D ⊂ R , = 1, 2, 3, be a physical domain with boundary ∂D and coordinates x = (x(1) , . . . , x( ) ) and let T > 0
be a real number. We consider the following general (scalar) stochastic partial diﬀerential equation
⎧
⎪
u (x, t, y) = L(u), D × (0, T ] × Rd ,
⎪
⎪
⎨ t
B(u) = 0,

where L is a (nonlinear) diﬀerential operator, B is the boundary condition operator, u0 is the initial condition, and
y = (y(1) , . . . , y(d) ) ∈ Rd , d ≥ 1, are a set of independent random variables characterizing the random inputs to the
governing equation from various sources, e.g., boundary condition, system parameters, etc. The solution is therefore
a stochastic quantity,
(2)
u(x, t, Z) : D¯ × [0, T ] × Rd → R.
Let us assume for all i = 1, . . . , d, the random variables y(i) are continuous with probability density functions (PDF)
ρ(i) : Γ(i) → R+ , where Γ(i) y(i) (Ω) is the image of y(i) . Then the random vector y = (y(1) , · · · , y(d) ) has a joint PDF

ρ(y) =

In the following we will adopt the multi-index notation: Let i = (i1 , . . . , id ) ∈ Nd0 be a multi-index, with |i| =
and i = j iﬀ. ik = jk , ∀k = 1, . . . , d. We also deﬁne an index set
{i ∈ Nd0 : |i| ≤ N}

(4)

for a given integer N ≥ 0. An N th -order generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion to the solution of (1) takes
the form
uN (t, x, y) =
uˆ i (t, x)Φi (y),
(5)
i∈JN

where, for the stochastic collocation method, the expansion coeﬃcients are determined by solving,
u(t, x, yk ) =

uˆ i (t, x)Φi (yk ),

∀k ∈ JN .

(6)

i∈JN

Thus, the stochastic collocation gPC approximation is determined by having knowledge of the solution of (1) for each
independent realization, yk , of the random inputs. Following classical approximation theory, the gPC expansion (5)
¯
converges when u is square integrable with respect to ρ(y), that is, for any ﬁxed (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × D,
u − uN

(7)

The convergence of the gPC approximation is directly related to the smoothness of the stochastic solution u. It
is possible to estimate the convergence rate of the gPC approximation by using the polynomial annihilation edge
detection methodology. Next we brieﬂy describe the polynomial annihilation edge method and demonstrate how to
use this method to estimate the error in the gPC expansion (5).
The polynomial annihilation edge detection method, introduced in [8], seeks to detect discontinuities by converging rapidly to zero in smooth regions by annihilating a pre-determine number of polynomials in the Taylor expansion
of the underlying function approximation. Since the gPC expansion is generated from polynomials we can modify the
polynomial annihilation edge detection method to approximate the residual of the gPC expansion, thereby giving an
good estimate of the error in the gPC method.
Using the gPC notation, the stochastic collocation method requires that the stochastic solution u is known on
S = {yk : k ∈ JN }.

Suppose that Ω is the convex hull of the set S, then given y ∈ Ω and an integer m such that it is possible to pick a set
Smd ,y := {y1 , . . . , ymd } ⊂ S,
for md :=

, then the mth order polynomial annihilation edge detector is deﬁned in [8] as,

Zd+ := {(α1 , . . . , αd ) : α1 , . . . , αd ∈ Z+ },
for Z+ := {0, 1, 2, · · · }.
Let T m−1 u be the Taylor expansion of u of degree m − 1 around y and let Rm−1 u be the residual of the Taylor
expansion, such that u = T m−1 u + Rm−1 u. Until this paper, an over looked property of the polynomial annihilation edge
detector is that for smooth regions,
Lm u(t, x, y)

qm,d (y) y ∈S

choosing the normalization factor as c j (t, x) yields,
Lm u(t, x, y) =

(13)

where the density measure is given by
h(y) := max min |y − y j |.
x∈Ω y j ∈Smd ,y

(14)

Therefore for any y j ∈ Smd ,y the edge detector Lm u(t, x, y) with normalization factor c j (t, x) will be a high order
approximation of the residual of the stochastic solution u at the realization y j . Thus it is possible to use the edge
detector to give good nodal approximation to the error in the stochastic collocation gPC (5) expansion. We use this
property in the next section to give error estimation to the gPC approximation various simulate climate statistics.
3. Results
We run the CESM for the supported case with resolution t42 and compset F1850, here after referred to at
t42t42.F1850. This case uses active atmosphere, land and ice components with prescribed ocean. We use this supported case with all the default parameters and input data sets. The default setting for the parameter rhminh is 0.5
and for rhminl it is 0.88. Figure 3 depicts our sampling and validation strategy. We run T42T42.F1850 for various
parameter combinations of (rhminh,rhminl) represented by the third order sparse grid [12] given by the blue mesh.
The red dots in Figure 3 depicts parameter combinations of (rhminh,rhminl) that we use for validation.
The Atmosphere Modeling Working Group (AMWG) diagnostics package [13] was run on each CESM run done
in this study. We speciﬁcally focus on FLNS and FSDS derived from the CESM simulation in the AMWG diagnostic
package. Using the values of FLNS and FSDS for each parameter combination on the blue grid in Figure 3, we
calculate the stochastic collocation gPC (5) expansion. Using this expansion, we approximate the values of FLNS and
FSDS for each parameter combination depicted in Figure 3 as red dots. In order to compare error approximation, we
simulate the model at these red dots, and only use these simulation values to compute the true error in approximation.
We use the hierarchical Lagrangian basis [12] for the stochastic collocation gPC (5) expansion. The red dots are

the center of mass of the triangulation of the third order sparse grid [12] given by the blue mesh. A ﬁrst order
approximation of the expansion error for each red dot would just be the maximum value minus the minimum value
of each vertex of the associated triangle. We use the polynomial annihilation edge detector method given in (13) and
the entire third order sparse grid as Smd ,y to get a second order error approximation for each red dot. Table 1 shows
the red dot parameter combinations along with the ﬁrst, second, and actual error in the stochastic collocation gPC (5)
expansion. It can be seen that second order polynomial annihilation error approximation is and order of improvement
over the ﬁrst order.
4. Discussion
This study demonstrates how the polynomial annihilation edge detection method [8] can be used to provide a high
order global error estimation of the stochastic collocation gPC expansion [2, 3]. This work focuses on characterization
of the Earth’s radiative budget in the CESM[9]. The beneﬁt of this approach is that climate researchers will know have
a method to both approximate stochastic solutions and estimate the error of these approximation. This will enhance
the amount of information that can be gain from ensemble climate simulations.
