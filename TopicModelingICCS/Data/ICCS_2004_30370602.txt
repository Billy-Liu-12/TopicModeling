Abstract. We consider the categorical concepts of a ‘network of networks’: (a) each node is a host network (1-network or 1-graph) and
super-links are analogous to a graph-functor, i.e. this is (1, 1)-network;
(b) 2-network where there are 2-links among 1-links. The general notion
of network-morphism is proposed.

Network

The dominant technological structure is a network (a graph), e.g. World Wide
Web graph, each web page is a node and each (hyper)link is a directed edge;
internet, social networks, networks in the molecular biology, a biological cell as
a network of genes, neural networks, metabolic network, scientiﬁc citation network, energetic networks, phone calls, linguistics networks, networks in natural
languages, ecological eco-networks, computer circuits, www.nd.edu/networks or
http://www.internetmathematics.org.
A graph underline a category [4,6,7, Burroni 1981, Lawvere 1989]. Graphs
provide useful concept in a computational science (integrating science with a
computation), braided logic [5, Ch´
avez Rodr´ıguez et al. 2001], etc. Lawvere consider the category of directed graphs and their morphisms [Lawvere 1989]. The
categorical aspects of graphs is not familiar outside of category theory. The value
of categories for computational science is that the category theory, invented by
Eilenberg and MacLane in 1945, has developed language for the study of structures, language for the formulation of problems, language for development of
methods of calculation and deduction, language for discovering and exploiting
analogies between various inter-disciplinary ﬁelds of science. Attraction of category theory is that the same algebraic tool=language is applicable in a variety
of multi-disciplinary science. Study of the structure (process) involves studying
the pre-categories (≡ graphs) and pre-functors ≡ graph-morphisms.

A graph consists of collections of variously called objects/nodes/vertices/states/0-cells V /G0 , and arrows/edges/links/transitions/1-cells E/G1 , with two operations: domain/source s : G1 → G0 and codomain/target t : G1 → G0 [4,9,
Burroni 1981, Mac Lane 1998]. Elements of G0 are said also to be 0-morphisms/0transitions, elements of G1 are said to be 1-morphisms/1-transitions. For a cell
f ∈ G, the value sf is said to be a domain or a source of f, and tf is a co-domain
or target of f.
A (time-dependent) out-degree of a cell x ∈ G is a cardinality of a ﬁber
s−1 x. An in-degree of x is a cardinality of t−1 x. The power-law degree say that
a distribution probability of the connecting links to the new node y (to a new
0-cell y) for ty is
(degree of y)−(1÷4) , known as a ‘scale-free’. A power-law
in-degree distribution means that the percentage of the number of cells with a
given in-degree is proportional to the power (in-degree)−constant . A power-law
degree was discovered by Lotka [8, 1926] in a scientiﬁc productivity.
The models of the time evolution of the networks, models of the graph-process
and models of the interactions among nodes, attract most attention. The best
known is the Barab´
asi-Albert model, based on two axioms one new vertex x ∈ V
at a time with a ﬁxed node-independent in-degree t−1 x ∈ N, [1,2, Barab´
asi &
Albert 1999; Barab´
asi 2002].

Aim of This Note

It was observed by Bharat et al. [3, 2001], that web-graph is a 2-level structure.
We consider the categorical concepts of a ‘network of networks’ or an hierarchical network. For a natural number m ∈ N we are introducing a concept of
a m-network, and moreover for m, n ∈ N a ﬁne concept of (m, n)-network. In
particular, our aim is to elucidate the diﬀerences and similarities among the
following hierarchical structures.
(a) Each node is a usual (connected) host network (1-network or 1-graph) and
super-links are analogous to a graph-functor. Such structure we call (1, 1)network or (1, 1)-graph, or ‘graph of host-graphs’, or a network of clusters
(b) 2-network (2-graph) where there are links among speciﬁed links of the same
type.
The study of categorical aspects of networks leads to new insights. A graph
is the same as 1-graph. We developed conceptual notion of a graph of graphs,
(1, 1)-graph, multi-graph m-graph, multi-graph of multi-graphs (m, n)-graph,
and iterations (n1 , . . . , nk )-graph for ∀ ni ∈ N. Graph of graphs can be used
for reﬁnement of the hierarchical structures and/or ‘network of networks’. In
particular the conceptual hierarchical structure ‘graph of graphs’ can be useful for description of the networks where the links are attribute-dependent and
therefore are natural ‘higher’ links between attributes leading to multi-level systems [10,11, Obtulowicz 2001], for example the attribute-dependent links among
employers and workers, professors and students.

Graph-Morphism

A multi-network G is a sequence of collections of i-cells/i-morphisms {Gi , i ∈ N},
a sequence of surjective sources {si ≡ s|Gi } and targets {ti ≡ t|Gi }. A 0-cell
in G0 is variously also called an object, 0-morphism, node; 1-cell - a morphism,
1-morphism, an arrow, a functor. A 2-cell is called a 2-morphism, morphism of
morphism, natural transformation, etc.
Let E ≡ (E0 ⇔ E1 ⇔ · · · ⇔ Ek ) and F ≡ (F0 ⇔ F1 ⇔ · · · ⇔ Fk ) be two
k-graphs. A k-graph morphism f : E → F, f ∈ graph(E, F ), is a collection of
functions fi : Ei → Fi , intertwining the source s and the target t maps (in this
case a morphism is said to be totally covariant),
s ◦ f = f ◦ s and t ◦ f = f ◦ t,
E 0 ⇔ E1 ⇔ E 2 . . .
↓ f0 ↓ f1 ↓ f2
F 0 ⇔ F1 ⇔ F 2 . . .
Set E, F ∈ G0 to be 0-cells, and graph(E, F ) ⊂ G1 , then G ≡ (G0 ⇔ G1 ) is a
graph of k-graphs, that we denote by (1, k)-graph. This means that every 0-cell
of G is a k-graph and every 1-cell of (1, k)-graph G is a k-graph morphisms,
f ∈ G0 (E, F ) ≡ graph(E, F ) ⊂ G1 .
A 1-graph G = (G0 ⇔ G1 ) whose every 0-cell is a graph, and every 1-cell
is a graph morphism, is said to be a graph of graphs. In particular, (0, 1)-graph
is a collection of 1-graphs, and a 1-graph whose every 0-cell is a 1-graph and
whose every 1-cell is 1-graph morphism is said to be a (1, 1)-graph. Therefore
we interpret (1, 0)-graph as a more particular concept that a general 1-graph.
2.1

2-Graph of Graphs

Let G be a 2-graph such that every 0-cell is a k-graph and every 1-cell is a k-graph
morphism, i.e. G is a (2, k)-graph. We need to deﬁne 2-cell as a k-graph natural
transformation. The following deﬁnition generalize the notion of the natural
transformation of (pre)functors from the case 2-graph of k = 1-graphs invented
by Eilenberg and MacLane [1945], to the case of arbitrary natural number k ∈ N.
Let f, g ∈ G0 (E, F ) ⊂ G1 . This means
G0 (E, F )(f, g)

⊂

G1 (f, g)

⊂

G2 .

A k-graph natural transformation t ∈ nat(f, g) ≡ G1 (f, g) ⊂ G2 , is a collection
of (i + 1)-cells-valued map intertwining f with g,

The inter-twining condition (1) is referred as the naturality condition.
Let sF denote F -source map. Then sF ◦ t = f = sG t, therefore sG is given
be push-forward, sG = (sF )∗ .
The k-graph natural transformation t ∈ nat(f, g) for the case of a ‘graph of
1-graphs’ is analogous to natural transformation of functors. A natural transformation t ∈ nat(f, g) can be illustrated also by means of a commutative diagram
with pull-back and push-forward,
E(x, y)

f

−−−−→ F (f x, f y)

(tx)

∗

F (gx, gy) −−−−→ F (f x, gy)
Therefore G0 (E, F ) ⊂ G1 can be seen as an 1-graph (= pre-functor graph):
vertices are the morphisms of graphs, f, g ∈ graph(E, F ), and edges are natural
transformations nat(f, g) ⊂ G2 .
A (0, 2)-graph is a collection G0 whose every element is a 2-graph. A (2, 0)graph is not the same as a 2-graph, i.e. a 2-graph G0 ⇔ G1 ⇔ G2 whose every
0-cell in G0 is a 0-graph set, 1-cells are mappings and 2-cells are operators.
