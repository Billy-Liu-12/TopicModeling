Abstract. This paper deals with customer’s credit risk assessment. We put forward a method based on the Linear Programming Technique for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP). The method is used to develop a
credit risk assessment model using a large sample of firms derived from the
loan portfolio of a leading Construction Bank of China. The model gave us the
method to determine the optimal credit evaluation weights and ideal point. Further we give an example for its application.

1 Introduction
Credit risk assessment is a significant area of financial management which is of major
interest to practitioners, financiers and credit analysts. Considerable attention has
been paid in this field from the theoretical and academic points during the last several
decades[1-17]. Financial and operational researchers have tried to relate the characteristics of a firm (Financial ratios and strategic variables) to its credit risk[1-5]. According to this relationship the components of credit risk are identified, and decision models are developed to assess credit risk and the corresponding credit worthiness of
firms as accurately as possible. The models include Z-score[6,7], discriminant analysis (DA)[8], logit analysis (LA) and probit analysis (PA) and more.
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the potentials and the applicability
of a new discrimination method in credit risk assessment, based on the linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP)[9]. The
LINMAP method employs a distance discrimination procedure to determine the class
to which the firms under consideration belong.

2 The Linear Programming Technique Based on Data Mining
Supposing the commercial bank will provides a loan for m customers, to evaluate the
customers’ credit, they employ n indexes. So m firms and n indexes form a credit
decision space[10-17]. In this credit decision space, every customer’s credit corresponds to a point respectively. If the customer’s best credit (the bank’s preference)
can be denoted with an ideal point in the decision space, the customer’s credit can be

described with a weighted distance. In the credit decision space, the weighted distance
*
*
*
between every point ( x i1 , x i 2 , L , x in ) and ideal point ( x1 , x 2 , L , x n ) is

⎡n
⎤2
d i = ⎢∑ w j ( xij − x *j ) 2 ⎥ , i = 1,2, L , m.
⎣ j =1
⎦
Where,

(1)

w j , ( j = 1,2, L , n) is the i-th index’s weight. It presents the importance of

i-th index. At the same time, the square distance can be denoted
n

S i = d i2 = ∑ w j ( xij − x *j ) 2 , i = 1,2, L , m.

(2)

j =1

*

In (2), w and x are unknown. We can get them by using a training sample.
Using the information in the training sample, we have a sequence relation ( Fk , Fl ) . For simplicity, we substitute ( k , l ) for sequence relation ( Fk , Fl ) .
The ( k , l ) means that k-th customer’s credit is better than l-th customer’s. Further, we

can get a sequence relation set Q = {( k , l )} . Obviously, there are n ( n − 1) / 2 elements in set Q, if we compare every two customer’s credit.
We can calculate the weighted distance between k-th customer or l-th customer and
ideal point, if we can find out

w and x * . They are

n

n

j =1

j =1

S k = ∑ w j ( xkj − x *j ) 2 and S l = ∑ w j ( xlj − x *j ) 2 .
In (3),

(3)

x kj is the value of the k-th customer to the j-th index. Similarly the value of the

l-th customer to the j-th index is xlj .
In set Q, if every sequence relation ( k , l ) satisfied

Sl ≥ Sk ,

(4)

the k-th customer’s credit is not worse than the l-th customer’s. It is consistent with
the information in training sample. Otherwise, if

Sl < Sk ,

(5)

the k-th customer’s credit is worse than the l-th customer’s. It is not consistent with
information in training sample. Apparently, if the training sample is large enough, the
weighted distance should be in accordance with the information of training sample.
For measuring the degree of inconsistency between the weighted distances and the
training sample information, we have to give a definition.

Definition 1. let

B=

( k ,l )∈Q

⎧ 0
= max(0 ; ( S k − S l )) .
(Sl − S k ) − = ⎨
⎩S k − S l , if S l < S k ,

(6)

B is called inconsistent degree between the weighted distances and the training sample information.
From definition 1, we know

( S l − S k ) − = 0 if S l ≥ S k and ( S l − S k ) − > 0 if S l < S k

S l and S k , the inconsistent degree is deeper.

The more different between
−

( S l − S k ) = S k − S l can measure the inconsistent degree. To finding out opti*

Definition 2. let G =

∑ (S

calling G is consistent degree between the weighted distances and the training sample
information. From definition 2, we know
( S l − S k ) − = 0 if S l < S k ；
( S l − S k ) − > 0 if S l ≥ S k .

S l and S k , the consistent degree is deeper.

The more different between
−

( S l − S k ) = S l − S k can measure the consistent degree.
We can minimize B, which subject to G > B or G − B = h > 0 , where h is a
small positive real number. From definition 1 and definition 2, we have

(S l − S k ) + − (S l − S k ) − = S l − S k .

(8)

Then

Then we can compute the weighted distance S between every customer’s credit and

3 An Example for Application
To illustrate the model of the LINMAP method, consider a simple example consisting
of 50 firms F1, F2, …, F50, evaluated along five financial ratios (x1: retained earnings/total assets, x2: earnings before interest and taxes/total assets, x3: net profit/total
assets, x4: net profit after taxes/total assets, x5: liquid assets/total assets). The firms are

divided into two groups (a training sample and a examination sample) and classified
into five categories. Table 1 illustrates the performances of the firms according to
each ratio and their classification.
From Table 1, we have a sequence relation set. So, we have a linear programming
problem. Solving it, we can get the optimal weights

Table 2 gives the square distance of firms in training sample. Then, we use an examination sample (as Table3) for model validation. Easily, we can obtain the results as
table4 shows. Combining Table4 with Table3 and Table2, we can find that the model
developed provided high classification accuracy. Only credit categories of F28, F33,
F35, F36, F37 and F39 are different from examination sample information.

4 Conclusions
This paper focused on the identification of commercial bank customer’s credit. The
approach employed for developing credit assessment model is based on LINMAP
approach. The method employs mathematical programming techniques to develop
credit rating model. In this paper the objective was to find out a method of credit
discrimination. Such a discrimination method supports credit analysts in identifying
potential defaulters, thus facilitating credit-granting decisions. Of course, the applications of the LINMAP method are not only limited to credit assessment; it also involves other financial risk management fields.
