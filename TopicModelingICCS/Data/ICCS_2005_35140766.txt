Abstract. In the paper, the method for determining of the conformation of nascent protein folding based on two-phase, sequential simulation approach is presented. In both phases the potential energy of molecule under construction is
minimized, however in the first phase the minimization is performed for the
structure {new amino acid}/{existing amino acid chain} and in the second
phase, the {new existing amino acid chain} conformation is “tuned” to reach
the minimal potential energy of growing chain. The formed, nascent conformation of protein determines initial condition for a future conformation modifications and plays a crucial role in fixing the biological and chemical features of
created protein. The simulation of conformation process is illustrated through
the numerical example of nascent protein folding for a selected protein.

1 Introduction
The chain of amino acids synthesized in a ribosome forms a polypeptide and in case
of a long chain, a protein. For the conformation simulation tasks, the synthesis programs generating the conformation of the main chain of amino-acid residues in a
polypeptide, use the amino acids library and need the information on the angles between α-carbons bonded with their side chains and contiguous peptide groups [1, 2, 3].
The backbone conformation of the chain of amino-acid residues can be determined by
the set of torsion angles [5] φ (rotation around the nitrogen-α-carbon bond), and ψ (rotation around the α-carbon-carbon bond in the chain of the polypeptide).
1.1 Torsion Angles
The relationship between the peptide groups, α-carbons and torsion angles can be expressed in the following form

→ PB → φ1 → Cα 1 → ψ 1 → PB → φ 2 → Cα 2 → ψ 2 → PB →

(1)

where PB denotes the peptide bond and Cα i is the i-th α-carbon atom. The torsion
angles play a crucial role in the conformation of proteins (Fig. 1) because the threedimensional structure of protein determines its biological functions including its activity in a signal transduction cascades [6, 7, 8].

On the other hand not all combinations of torsion angles φi and ψi in (1) for each
amino acid are possible, as many leads to collision between atoms in adjacent residues exposed by Ramachandran restrictions (map) [7, 9]. By assuming that atoms
behave as hard spheres, allowed ranges of torsion angles can be predicted and visualized in contour of Ramachandran plots based on X-ray crystallography [10]. Nearly
every polypeptide or protein in a cell is chemically altered after its synthesis in a ribosome. Many proteins are later modified in a reversible manner, fulfilling its functions
after the activation forced by the messenger molecules. Such modifications expressed
in the conformational changes [11, 12, 13], may alter the biological activity, life span,
or cellular location of proteins, depending on the nature of alteration.
1.2 Conformational Energy

The force powered changes of spatial shape is a tendency of the chain of polypeptide
to get minimal potential energy. The potential energy of nanostructure defined also as
conformational energy, according to the principles of molecular mechanics [17, 21,
23] accepts the general form
E ( x) =

∑U

j ( x)

,

(2)

j

where the expression U j (x) describes the proper type of potential energy (bonds

stretching energy around equilibrium length of bonds, angles bending energy, multipole interactions energy, Lennard-Jones or generally Mie potentials etc.) of the intermolecular interactions there be a function of degrees of freedom and the physicochemical constants determined for the specified types of atoms, bonds, and in molecule configurations. The entries x1, x2, x3, ..... of a vector x represent the degrees of
freedom relating with distances and proper characteristic angles.
The spatial structure of molecule is described in one of the accepted standard formats: PDB [28] or mmCIF [27]. Dependent on type of atoms, type of bonds and the
configuration of atoms in a molecule, the physicochemical constants are collected in
tables (so called Force Field) e.g. AMBER [26], ENCAD [22], CHARMM [25] and
others (depending on type of chemical compounds), applied in computations [16].
Minimizing the expression (2) which describes a conformational energy of structure for vector x with constraints (Ramachandran plots), it is possible to find a stationary point defining the stable structure in a given conditions. However, the complex form of expression (2), usually leads to the problem related with multiple local
minima or saddle points. In the saddle points of the surface of energy for which the
gradient E (x) reaches zero the crucial role play the eigenvalues of hessian matrix built
for function E (x) , which allow to define the farther run of the settlement of nanostructure conformation. And so simple algorithms of optimization e.g. gradient-based,
Newton’s or Fletcher-Powell have to be modified to find the global minimum. The
implementation of algorithms of dynamic programming [3, 19, 20] or Monte Carlo
methods [4, 15, 24] is better solution.
Using new, two-phase sequential simulation approach, we will find the free conformation (initial conformation or nascent protein folding) for the exemplary protein

768

through the minimization of the energy [16] as a function of the torsion angles [3, 16,
17], however, we do not look for the global minimum of conformational energy,
rather we perform the sequence of optimization corrections [14] for the growing
chain. The simulation process retains the same sequence of events as a real process of
nascent protein elongation.

2 Two-Phase Sequential Simulation Algorithm
The basic assumption for the construction of simulation algorithm is an observation,
that the new amino-acid appearing from the ribosome rotates the existing chain of
amino acids in a such manner, that the torsion angles on the new peptide bond, accordingly with minimization of potential energy of the structure {new amino acid}
/{existing amino acid chain} are determined, and next, the conformation of the whole
structure is somewhat modified to minimize the potential energy of {new existing
amino acid chain}. The first minimization plays a crucial role because of dimensions
of peptide chain in comparison with the new molecule attached.
2.1 Initialization
The space defining available regions of φ and ψ angles (Fig. 1) is quantized and translated to the linear vector of available coordinates. The two first amino acids adopt the
conformation minimizing expression
min

ϕ0 ,ψ 0 ,ϕ1 ,ψ 1

E 2 (ϕ 0 ,ψ 0 , ϕ1 ,ψ 1 ) ,

(3)

where E2 is a potential energy of the system of two amino acids, ϕ 0 and ψ 0 are the
torsion angles of the first amino acid, as well as ϕ1 and ψ 1 are the torsion angles of
the second amino acid (Fig. 1a). In the Initialization and First Phase of simulation the
search for energy decreasing is performed in the discretized, allowed ranges of torsion
angles for glycine, proline and all 18 remaining amino acids specifically, predicted as
modified Ramachandran plots based on X-ray crystallography [10]. In the Second
Phase of simulation during the chain “shaking” process, only the generated torsion
angles which remain in the allowed ranges are used. The energy computations apply
the AMBER force field and the Tinker subroutines [16].
2.2 First Phase of Simulation
When the third residue appears (#2 in Fig. 1b), the following expression is minimized
min E3 (ϕ 2 ,ψ 2 , ϕ 0 f ,ψ 0 f , ϕ1 f ,ψ 1 f ) ,

ϕ 2 ,ψ 2

(4)

where E3 is a potential energy of the system of three amino acids, ϕ0 f ,ψ 0 f , ϕ1 f ,
ψ 1 f are the torsion angles determined in the initialization.
The first phase for fourth amino acid is preceded by the second phase which tunes
the existing, whole chain to get the minimal potential energy (point 2.3).
Accordingly, for the fourth amino acid we minimize the expression

Non-gradient, Sequential Algorithm for Simulation of Nascent Polypeptide Folding

min E 4 (ϕ 3 ,ψ 3 , ϕ 2 s ,ψ 2 s , ϕ 0 f s ,ψ 0 f s , ϕ1 f s ,ψ 1 f s ) ,

ϕ3 ,ψ 3

769

(5)

where E4 is a potential energy of the system of four amino acids, and ϕ 2 s ,ψ 2 s , ϕ 0 f s ,
ψ 0 f s , ϕ1 f s ,ψ 1 f s are the torsion angles determined in the second phase for the three
amino acids (Fig. 1c).
2.3 Second Phase of Simulation
For the consecutive residues, bonded to the growing chain, the global tuning after the
first phase takes place. Along the backbone of the chain (Fig. 1b, c), the torsion angles
are changed in the four directions: + k∆ϕ i , −k∆ϕ i , + k∆ψ i , and − k∆ψ i , including the
current ϕi andψ i (i = 0, 1, …. n) angles. Values of ∆ϕ i and ∆ψ i determine the amplitudes of reversible changes of torsion angles along the chain, and k is a positive and
decreasing parameter during the consecutive steps of the minimization of potential
energy of the chain.

(first phase of simulation), c) the four residues (first phase of simulation)

The parameter k can be constant in one iteration step, as well as may be a function
of selected parameters. In the proposed approach, we omit the problem of hydrogen
and disulfide bonds creation.

3 Numerical Example
An illustration of presented two-stage simulation of nascent protein folding are the
intermediate and final results in simulation of elongation process and conformational
changes of the small protein containing thirty eight amino acids:

cys – asn – cys – val – ile – gly – tyr – ser.
The initialization phase of simulation based on the minimizati on of expression (3),
gives the dipeptide asn-ser with four torsion angles. The conformation of dipeptide
and the set of torsion angles is presented in Fig. 2.
When the third amino acid appears i.e. tyrosine, the first phase of simulation for
the elongated tripeptide gives the results presented in Fig. 3a, b. The expression (4) is
minimized over the ϕ 2 and ψ 2 angles with remaining angles unchanged.
In the second phase, the tripeptide chain is “shaked” along the backbone with
o
∆ϕi = ∆ψ i = 32o and k decreasing twice per step until resolution 1 , better resolution
usually needs parallel processing.

Continuing this process, the eight amino acids chain obtains the conformation after
the first and second phase of simulation presented in Fig. 4. Finally, the whole 38
amino acids chain adopts the conformation after first and second phase of simulation
presented in Fig. 5. The results of computations have been compared with the results
obtained in different discretization grid of the permissible torsion angles, and the
differences were acceptable.

The interesting observation can be do refer to the conformations of the same polypeptide sub-chain during the elongation phase and post-translational modifications
namely cleavage of the main chain. In Fig. 6 the conformation of the initial eight
amino acids cleaved from the whole chain has been presented. Comparing this conformation with the conformations of the same sub-chain of polypeptide in elongation
phase (Fig. 4) we see the difference in the spatial shapes of these nanostructures. It
suggests that the folding process of polypeptide depends on the sequence of external
events preceding the final conformation.

4 Conclusions
The paper presents two-phase algorithm for modeling and simulation of composite
phenomena in protein processing: model building and simulation of initial phase of
establishing the conformation of nascent protein folding.
The introductory experiments reveal, that the crucial role plays the phase when the
new, consecutive amino acid bonds to the existing chain of polypeptide. This phenomenon is represented in simulation by the first phase, underlying fact that the new
amino acid is partly fixed in the ribosome.

We can expect, that the similar situation appears at the output of chaperones [29].
In the second phase of simulation, the whole structure is under the influence of annealing process reaching the nascent conformation. This phase of protein folding can
be treated as a correction of initial conformation.
The very interesting observation was made refer to post-translational modifications. The conformations of the same sub-chain of polypeptide in elongation phase
and after cleavage of the main chain are different. It suggests that the folding process
of polypeptide can not be understand as a simple minimization process of conformational energy but depends on the sequence of events preceding the final state.
Developed simulation software implementing mainly paradigms of molecular mechanics will be enriched in the scope of detection of stabilizing bonds as well as in the
analysis tools for tracking the environmental modifications of protein conformation.
