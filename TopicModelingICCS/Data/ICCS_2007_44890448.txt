Abstract. Let G(V, E) be a simple graph, and let f be an integer function on V with 1 ≤ f (v) ≤ d(v) to each vertex v ∈ V . An f -edge
cover-coloring of a graph G is a coloring of edge set E such that each
color appears at each vertex v ∈ V at least f (v) times. The f -edge
cover chromatic index of G, denoted by χf c (G), is the maximum number of colors such that an f -edge cover-coloring of G exists. Any simple
graph G has f -edge cover chromatic index equal to δf or δf -1, where
δf = min{ fd(v)
}. If χf c (G) = δf , then G is of Cf I class; otherwise

G is of Cf II class. In this paper, we give some suﬃcient conditions for
a graph to be of Cf I class, and discuss the classiﬁcation problem of
complete graphs on f -edge cover-coloring.

Introduction

Our terminology and notation will be standard. The reader is referred to [1] for
the undeﬁned terms. Graphs in this paper are simple, unless otherwise stated,
i.e., they have no loops or multiple edges. We use V and E to denote, respectively,
the vertex set and edge set of a graph G. Let NG (v) denote the neighborhood of
v and let d(v) = |NG (v)| be the degree of v in G. We write δ for the minimum
degree of G. We associate positive integer 1, 2, · · · with colors, and we call C a kedge coloring of G if C : E → {1, 2, · · · , k}. Let Ci (v) denote the number of edges
of G incident with vertex v that receive color i by the coloring C. Assume that a
positive integer f (v) with 1 ≤ f (v) ≤ d(v) is associated with each vertex v ∈ V .
We call C an f -edge cover-coloring of G if for each vertex v ∈ V , Ci (v) ≥ f (v)
for i = 1, 2, · · · , k, that is each color appears at each vertex v ∈ V at least f (v)
times. Let χf c (G) denote the maximum number of colors for which an f -edge
cover-coloring of G exists. We call χf c (G) the f -edge cover chromatic index of G.

so on, are related to the f -edge cover-coloring which was ﬁrst presented by Song
and Liu [5].
d(v)
Let δf = min{ fd(v)
(v) }, in which f (v) is the largest integer not larger than
v∈V

d(v)
f (v) .

It is easy to verify that χf c (G) ≤ δf . Song and Liu studied the bound of
f -edge cover chromatic index of a graph and obtained the following result.
Theorem 1. [5] Let G be a graph. Let f (v), d(v) and δf be as deﬁned earlier.
Then
d(v) − 1
} ≤ χf c (G) ≤ δf .
δf − 1 ≤ min{
v∈V
f (v)
From the above theorem we can see that the f -edge cover chromatic index of
any graph G must be equal to δf or δf -1. This immediately gives us a simple
way of classifying graphs into two types according to χf c (G). More precisely,
we say that G is of Cf I class if χf c (G) = δf , and that G is of Cf II class if
χf c (G) = δf -1.
Song and Liu also obtained the following two results.
Theorem 2. [5] Let G be a bipartite graph. Let f (v) and δf be as deﬁned
earlier. Then χf c (G) = δf .
Theorem 3. [5] Let G be a graph. Let f (v) and δf be as deﬁned earlier. If f (v)
is positive and even for all v ∈ V , then χf c (G) = δf .
If f (v) = 1 for all v ∈ V , the classiﬁcation problem on f -edge cover-coloring is
reduced to the classiﬁcation problem on the ordinary edge cover-coloring which
was studied by Miao [4] and Wang [6]. Hilton [2] studied the f -edge covercoloring of multigraph G with f (v) = j ≥ 2 for all v ∈ V . In this paper, we
study the f -edge cover chromatic index of simple graphs. In section 2, we give
some suﬃcient conditions for a simple graph to be of Cf I class. In section 3, we
discuss the classiﬁcation problem of complete graphs on f -edge cover-coloring.

The Classiﬁcation of Graphs on f -Edge Cover-Coloring

In this section, we give some suﬃcient conditions for a graph to be of Cf I class.
Let V ∗ = {v : δf = fd(v)
v ∈ V }, then we have the following important
(v) ,
theorem.
Theorem 4. Let G be a graph. Let f (v) and V ∗ be as deﬁned earlier. If f (v ∗ )
d(v ∗ ) for all v ∗ ∈ V ∗ , then G is of Cf I class.
Proof. By Theorem 1, it is enough to prove that min{
v∈V

min{
v∈V

d(v)
f (v)

}, we have

d(v)
f (v)

d(v)−1
f (v)

} ≥ δf . For δf =

> δf for each vertex v ∈ V \ V ∗ . So

d(v)−1
f (v)

On the other hand, for each vertex v ∗ ∈ V ∗ , f (v ∗ ) d(v ∗ ) implies that
d(v ∗ )
f (v ∗ )

= δf . So

d(v ∗ )−1
f (v ∗ )

≥

d(v ∗ )
f (v ∗ )

= δf , then we have min{

χf c (G) = δf , this completing the proof.

v∈V

d(v)−1
f (v)

≥ δf .
d(v ∗ )
f (v ∗ )

Let k be a positive integer and the k-core of G be the subgraph of G induced by
the vertices v of G such that k | d(v). The following lemma is given by Hilton
and de Werra.
Lemma 1. [3] Let G be a graph and let k ≥ 2. If the k-core of G is a set of
isolated vertices, then G has a k-edge coloring such that for each vertex v ∈ V
and each i, j ∈ {1, · · · k}, |Ci (v) − Cj (v)| ≤ 1 holds.
Theorem 5. Let G be a graph. Let f (v), d(v) ,δf and V0∗ be as deﬁned earlier.
If V0∗ = {v : δf = fd(v)
v ∈ V } is a set of isolated vertices in graph G, then G
(v) ,
is of Cf I class.
Proof. If δf = 1, obviously, G is of Cf I class. Assume that δf ≥ 2. Let V0 =
{v : δf |d(v), v ∈ V } and S = V0 \ V0∗ . It is easy to prove that for each vertex
d(v)
v ∈ S, fd(v)
(v) > δf , that is δf > f (v). Since f (v) and δf are both integer, and
δf |d(v). Then d(v)
δf ≥ f (v) + 1.
We shall form graph G by adding a pendant edge to each vertex of S on
graph G. Clearly, δf d(v) for each vertex v ∈ S, and V0∗ is the δf -core of G
which is a set of isolated vertices. By Lemma 1, G has a δf -edge coloring such
that for each vertex v ∈ V (G) and ∀ i, j ∈ {1, · · · δf }, |Ci (v) − Cj (v)| ≤ 1 holds.
Since for each vertex v ∈ S, we notice that dGδf(v) ≥ d(v)
≥ f (v) + 1, and
δf
|Ci (v) − Cj (v)| ≤ 1 (∀ i, j ∈ {1, · · · δf }). That is, every color of {1, 2, · · · δf } is
represented at least f (v) + 1 times at v. By restricting the δf -edge coloring of
G to G, we obtain an f -edge cover-coloring of G with δf colors. That is, G is
of Cf I class. This proves the Theorem.

The f -Edge Cover-Coloring of Complete Graphs

In this section, we discuss the classiﬁcation problem of complete graphs on f edge cover-coloring. Our main result is Theorem 6, in order to prove it, we need
the following useful lemma which appears in [3].
Lemma 2. [3] Let C be a k-edge coloring of graph G. If |Cα (v0 ) − Cβ (v0 )| > 2
for some pair α, β of colors and some vertex v0 . Then G must be recolored with
k colors such that
max |Ci (v0 ) − Cj (v0 )| ≤ 2.
1≤i<j≤δ

And for each v ∈ V , the number of colors appears on vertex v would not reduce.
A k-f actor of a graph G is a k-regular spanning subgraph. Let G be an mkregular graph. If H1 , H2 , . . . , Hm are edge-disjoint k-factors of G, then which is
called a k-f actorization of G.
Theorem 6. Let G be a complete graph Kn . If k and n are odd integers, f (v) =
k and k | d(v) for all v ∈ V , then G is of Cf II class. Otherwise, G is of Cf I
class.

Proof. If δf = 1, obviously, G is of Cf I class. Assume that δf ≥ 2. Let f ∗ =
max{f (v)}. If f ∗ (n − 1), then by Theorem 4, G is of Cf I class. Next suppose
v∈V

f ∗ | (n − 1), we consider the following two cases.
Case 1: n is even, suppose n = 2t, where t is a positive integer. Then f ∗ |
(2t − 1). It is well-known that G has a 1-factorization, and we can give an f -edge
cover-coloring of G with δf colors. G is of Cf I class.
Case 2: n is odd. Let n = 2t + 1, where t is a positive integer. There are
three subcases.
Subcase 2.1. f ∗ is even, let f ∗ = 2m. It is well-known that G = K2t+1 has
a 2-factorization, and we also can give an f -edge cover-coloring of G with δf
colors. So G is of Cf I class.
Subcase 2.2. If f (v) = k, k | 2t and k is odd for all v ∈ V . We show that G
d(v)
2t
is of Cf II class. Because δf = min{ fd(v)
(v) }, we have δf = k = k . Suppose
v∈V

that G = K2t+1 is of Cf I class. Thus ci (v) = k for each i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , δf } and
each v ∈ V . The number of edges colored with a color of δf colors is k(2t+1)
.
2
k(2t+1)
Obviously,
is not an integer. This contradicts to our assumption. So
2
G = K2t+1 is of Cf II class when f (v) = k is odd and k | d(v) for all v ∈ V .
Subcase 2.3. f ∗ is odd and there exists at least a vertex v ∈ V such that
f (v) < f ∗ . Clearly, δf = f2t∗ . We will give an f -edge cover-coloring of G with δf
colors as follows. Suppose v is the vertex of graph G such that f (v ) ≤ f ∗ − 1.
Let G = G \ {v }. Obviously, G = K2t , and let H = {H1 , H2 , . . . , H2t−1 } is
a 1-factorization of G . Partition H into δf subsets A1 , A2 , . . . , Aδf , in which
|Aδf | = f ∗ − 1 and |Ai | = f ∗ , 1 ≤ i ≤ δf − 1. Assign color i to the edges in
Ai , for each i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , δf }. Clearly, Ci (v) = f ∗ for all v ∈ V (G ) and all
i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , δf − 1}, but Cδf (v) = f ∗ − 1 for all v ∈ V (G ). Let Ev = {v u :
u ∈ V (G )}, and we color the edges in Ev with color δf . Then Ci (v) = f ∗ ≥
f (v) for all v ∈ V (G ) and all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , δf }, and Cδf (v ) − Ci (v ) = 2t
for all i = δf . We apply Lemma 2 successively to vertex v for each color of
{1, 2, . . . , δf − 1} and color δf , until we ultimately obtained a δf -edge coloring
C of graph G such that for each vertex v = v and for all i ∈ {1, · · · , δf },
Ci (v) = Ci (v) = f ∗ ≥ f (v) and |Ci (v ) − Cj (v )| ≤ 2 for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , δf }.
It implies Ci (v ) ≥ δ2tf − 1 = f ∗ − 1 ≥ f (v ) for each i ∈ {1, · · · , δf }. Then C
is an f -edge cover-coloring of G. Graph G is of Cf I class. This completes the
proof of the theorem.
