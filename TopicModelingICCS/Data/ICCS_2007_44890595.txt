Abstract. In order to give adaptive instruction to the learner, it needs to know
what knowledge the learner has and what goals the learner is trying to archive.
This paper proposes a method to build a model based on Bayesian networks in
order to assess the learner’s knowledge level. An overlay student model based
on Bayesian networks is presented. This student model built on knowledge
relationships with prediction ability is discussed in details. In this model, an
assessing method based on Logistic model in IRT with three parameters is
provided to evaluate student’s performance. A case study in the course of Data
Structure is illustrated in this paper.
Keywords: Modeling, Assessing, Bayesian networks.

1 Introduction
In the e-learning field, many researchers have focused on how to instruct the learners
in order to support them adaptive learning. Because the learners’ backgrounds are
different and what goals they are trying to archive are different, they need to be
instructed individually in the e-learning system. In order to assess the learner, we
propose an effective student modeling method using overlay model to represent the
beliefs for the student's knowledge. In this model, the student’s knowledge is regarded
as the subset of expert’s knowledge. The expert’s knowledge can be divided into
various knowledge items in different levels. The student model is used to represent
the understanding degrees on those knowledge items. The teaching goal is to reduce
the difference between the expert’s knowledge and student’s knowledge.

2 Student Modeling Method
In this paper, we analyze and build the student model in the course of Data Structure.
Each type of data structures has its various applications based on its characteristics.
Here, we describe the various knowledge items in the unit of Binary Tree in table 1.
There are two kinds of relationships between knowledge items: organization
relationships and dependency relationships. Combining these two structures, we can
build the student model based on knowledge relationships in figure 1.

Fig. 1. The student model based on knowledge relationships

In the organization relationships, the item at the beginning of an arrow is the parent
item to the item at the end point. The items in the topological structure have different
importance levels and difficulty levels. They also have different influences to their parent
items. We define the different weights of the knowledge item Ii to influence its parent in
different status: High, Medium, Low, and UMaster. For each item Ii, its weight to its
parent is defined as wi. The θ is defined as θ I ∈ {High, Medium, Low, UMaster} . Its
i

updated weigh will be given in formula 1:

Under the expert’s help, we could decide the weight distributions. So we could
calculate the conditional probability among the items in the organization
relationships. The dependency relationships in the student model could be used to
predict the related mastered status based on status of other item. Here, we use the

parameter learning algorithm, which was proposed by Heckerman[2], to identify these
conditional probabilities. The hypothesis is described in the formula 2:
n

p ( K N +1 | D s , S s ) = ∏
i =1

In which

α ij = ∑k =1α ijk

of cases in domain D,in which Xi =xi and Pai =pai .Here, we use Ds as the
student assessing sample. Ss is the topological structure in the student model. KN+1 is
some knowledge item.

3 Assessing Method
Here we add the testing nodes in the student model in order to get the student’s
responses as evidences[3]. The assessing parameter is the prior probability between
the knowledge item and testing node and can be described by the item characteristic
curve(ICC) with three parameters[1]. The model can be written as formula 3:

P(T = 1 | I = θ ) = P(θ ) = ci + (1 − ci )

1
1+ e

−1.7 ai (θ − bi )

(3)

In which, the parameter a, b and c could be decided by the experts. We use four
statuses, such as H, M, L, and UMaster. They are defined as P(θH)=1-s, P(θM)=2*( θH
- θU)/3, P(θL)=( θH - θU)/3, and P(θU)=c. Here s is the probability of misplay. Then we
could predigest the formula as formula 4:

(4)

So we could assess the student’s ability according to his answer with this assessing
method. The student model can be described as the set of KnowledgeItem-Value, in
which the KnowledgeItem is the knowledge unit, and Value is the examinee’s
mastery level θ. The value of θ belongs to the range of (High, Medium, Low,
UMaster). So we can calculate the value of meta-knowledge item Ia in the formula 5:
V Ia

＝θ

if

∃ P ( I a = θ ′) < P ( I a = θ )

(5)

In which θ′∈{S-θ}, S={High, Medium, Low, UMaster}. Here, we define the
maximal marginal probability (MP) of the student’s knowledge level as the student’s
mastery ability. {Ia} represents the whole knowledge items included in the composed
knowledge item Io and minMP is the minimum marginal probability. We can calculate
the value of the composed knowledge item in formula 6:

minMP+ 2 / 3(1 − minMP) < P( Io = Master) < 1
2 / 3minMP+ 1/ 3(1 − minMP) < P( Io = Master) < minMP+ 2 / 3(1 − minMP)
1/ 3minMP < P( Io = Master) < 2 / 3minMP+ 1/ 3(1 − minMP)

(6)

0 < P( Io = Master) < 1/ 3minMP

So we can get the final student model based on the marginal probability (MP)
coming from the updated Bayesian networks.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose an effective student modeling method built on organization
relationships and dependency relationships among the knowledge items based on
Bayesian networks. The dependency relationships among the knowledge items are
reflected in this overlay model. In order to assess student’s performance, we adopt
Logistic model with three parameters in IRT model to calculate the conditional
probability distribution among the testing items. In the further work, we will improve
and apply this method in the whole process of the course of Data Structure.
