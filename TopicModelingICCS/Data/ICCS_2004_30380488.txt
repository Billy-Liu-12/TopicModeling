Abstract. It is considered a problem of forming information profiles of
distributed data- and/or knowledge bases as a result of satisfying the requirements representing the information profiles of the customers. It is shown that
the interests of data- and knowledge bases managers are not fully convergent
and that they participate in a composite, partially co-operative, partially non-cooperative game. There is given a formal description of the strategies used in this
game, as well as the methods of decision making of the players.

1 Introduction
A spontaneous and dramatic development of open-access data- and knowledge bases
in the last decades has led to a new situation in many areas of human activity
depending on the access to information resources. This remark concerns various
branches of scientific research, technology, education, administration, trade, health
services, national security, natural environment protection, etc. For the existence and
development of all the above mentioned areas access to information resources
satisfying specific requirements of the users is necessary. Distributed databases
accessible through Internet (or through any other computer networks) make possible
reaching higher quality of human activities and, as a result, they open a new era in
modern civilisation development. But at the same time their impact on our life has
caused new problems that existed never before or existed only in a germinal state.
Till databases were created by the same organisations they were dedicated to the
interests of database managers were close to those of database users and the area of
conflicts between them was strongly limited. New situation arose when government
or other higher administrative authorities tried to initialise design and construction of
computer-based information systems in order to force higher effectiveness in subordered organisations. The goals of information systems’ sponsors, designers and
users were divergent and, as a result, many so-designed information systems failed as
being not accepted by their potential users. Free information market gives another
possibility of information systems creation according to the requirements of various
subjects. In this case existence of no general “optimum” is assumed; information
creators, systems managers, and information users can express their proper goals and
they participate in a multi-person game trying to reach their individual optima.
Simultaneous reaching of all so-defined optima is impossible; however, the market
mechanisms make possible reaching a common balance point being a compromise
between the partners’ expectations.

General concepts of the theory of games we owe to J. von Neumann and O.
Morgenstern [1]. For more than fifty years various types of games: two- and multiperson, discrete- and continuous-strategy, differential, antagonistic and nonantagonistic, co-operative and non-co-operative, one- and multi-level, etc. were
investigated [2,3,7]. Various areas of game theory applications: in business,
technology, military service, etc., were also considered. The work [4] by E.A. Berzin
where game theory application to distribution of resources has been investigated is
close to our interests. Some aspects of games played in information systems design
and maintaining were also mentioned in [5] while in [6] the role of self-organisation
in distributed databases development was considered. The aim of this paper is
presentation of a more detailed model of distributed information resources gathering
and their profiles forming based on the theory of n-person games.

2 Basic Model Assumptions
It will be considered a system of primary information supply (IS) and a one of
information distribution (ID) as two complementary components of information
market. The IS system is the one where information in the form of various types of
documents (electronic, photo, multi-media, hard copy manuscripts, publications,
etc.) is offered to the customers. For many years this type of information distribution
and exchange was prevailing.
This situation has been changed with computer networks development; the action
of ID system is based on electronic documents exchange through computer
networks. ID system thus consists of a set of open-access data banks (OADB) and of
a number of dedicated local data banks (LDB), mutually connected by computer
network, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. A model of information storage and distribution

Information resources of OADBs are permanently extended and supplied with
documents from the IS system. The role of OADBs consists in brokerage: they buy
information documents, select information from them, transform, store and sell or
distribute it among the LDBs, the last being explored by organisations or by
individual users. Information resources of the LDBs are thus completed according to
the needs of the users. The LDBs can be supplied by information not only from
OADBs, but also from their proper information sources, as well as directly from the
IS system.
It is assumed that each document offered at the information market can be
described by the following characteristics: 1) formal properties: type of the

490

J.L. Kulikowski

document, its author(s), title, volume, editor, date of edition, etc.; 2) contents
(described by keywords, descriptors, etc.); 3) acquirement conditions (name of the
seller, price, forms of payment, delivery time, number of available copies of the
document, etc.); 4) supply indicator (number of available copies of the document, if
limited, infinite otherwise). The document characteristics can be formally
represented as elements of a document characteristics space DCS being a Cartesian
product:
DCS = Cf × Cc × Ca × Cs

(1)

where Cf , Cc, Ca and Cs stand, correspondingly, for the sets of formal, contents,
acquirement and supply characteristics’ possible values. We shall denote by hi, hi ∈
DCS, the characteristic of a document xi, i∈ [1,2,3,…].
The state of information market is a time-varying process: at any fixed timeinstant t0, t0 ∈ T (T being a real discrete time-axis), the instant-value of the process is
given by a finite subset X(t0) ⊂ DCS of the documents that actually are offered on the
market. The members xi of X(t) thus arise at certain time-instants and next, after a
certain time-delay they may disappear. However, formal description of a timeprocess’ values in the set theory terms is not very convenient. Instead of this it will be
taken into account a set of time-functions: ξi :
T → DCS

(2)

assigning to each time-instant t ∈ T a document characteristic (an element of DCS) so
that the components of Cf and Cc remain constant while those of Ca and Cs may be
varying in time. The subsets X(t) contain only the elements (documents) for which
the indices δi of the components of Ca take positive, non-zero values. For those
elements the components of Ca are also defined, otherwise the values ∅ (= undefined)
to them are assigned. However, the vector ξ(t) consisting of linearly ordered
components ξi(t) is not known but for the past and present time-instants t only. It is
reasonable to consider it as a realisation of a stochastic vector process Ξ(t) describing
the states of the information market changing in time. The subsets X(t) determine, at
the same time, the areas of possible instant decisions of the OADB managers. Their
aim consists in actualisation and extension of the OADBs according to the expected
demands of the customers. Therefore, at any t they can chose the following decisions:
0
1 to select and to acquire new documents in order to include and to keep them in the
0
data banks, 2 to select some documents and to delay a final decision about their
0
acquirement, and 3 to reject all actual proposals concerning documents selling. In the
0
0
cases 1 an d 2 the decision made by the ν-th OADB manager (ν = 1,2,…,N, where
N denotes the total number of OADB managers) takes the form of a subset:

ψν (t) ⊆ DCS

(3)

whose members correspond to the selected elements of X(t) and are such that:
o
1 the projections of the members of ψν(t) on Cf × Cc × Ca are equal to the
corresponding elements of X(t) projected on Cf × Cc × Ca;
o
2 the values of the components βi of Cs in the members of ψν (t) satisfy the
inequalities
0≤ βi(t) ≤ δi(t),

(4)

491

which means that the documents acquisition requirement can not exceed the
corresponding supply indicators. The document suppliers then collect the
requirements and try to realise them. The number of sold document’s copies can not
exceed the declared supply indicator. Therefore, it may happen that some document
acquisition requirements are not satisfied. However, the strategy of clients’ selection
on the information market here will not be considered. In any case, when coming to
the next (t+1) time-instant the supply indicators should be actualised: reduced by the
numbers of sold document copies and increased by the numbers of the new-supplied
ones.
The documents acquired by the OADBs can be included into the data banks
directly or after a transformation process changing their form or generating some
secondary documents on the basis of information selected from the primary ones. In
similar way as shown before a modified document characteristics space can be
defined:
DCS

(ν )

= Cνf × Cνc × Cνa
( )

( )

( )

(5)

Here the notions C ν f , C ν c and C ν a are, in general, similar to the Cf , Cc and Ca used in
(1); however, a dependence on ν indicates that each (ν-th) OADB may use its proper
language and standards for data files characterisation and define data acquirement
( )
( )
conditions for the customers. So, a subset K ν ⊆ DCS ν plays the role of a catalogue
( )
of data offered to the managers of LDBs or to individual users. A projection of K ν on
(ν )
(ν )
(ν )
(ν )
(ν )
the document characteristic subspace C f × C c , L ⊆ C f × C c, will be called a
( )
( )
profile of the ν-th OADB (OADB ν ), and its elements will be denoted by λ ν . A
(ν )
substantial difference between the formerly defined characteristics hi and the λ ones
( )
consists in the fact that hi describes the document in its original form while λ ν
(ν )
describes secondary documents in electronic form. Forming the profiles L of the
OADBs is the main element of long-term strategies of OADB’s managers.
Then, let us take into consideration the managers’ of LDBs point of view. They
represent the interests of some groups of information users (or are information users
themselves). The users need to have easy access to information resources suitable for
satisfying their intellectual (educational, cultural, etc.) interests or for solving some
professional (technological, administrative, etc.) tasks. Let us assign index µ to a
certain group of information users. Then their information needs can be formally
represented by subsets of
a Cartesian product describing an information
requirements space:
( )

( )

( )

IRS µ = C*
( )

(µ)
f

× C*

(µ)
c

× C*

(µ)
a

(6)

Once more, the notions C* µ f , C* µ c and C* µ a are, in general, similar to the Cf, Cc
and Ca ones; however, a dependence on m shows that each (m-th) LDB may use its
proper language and standards for data files characterisation and define additional
conditions for data acquisition (like admissible cost, time-delay, etc.). In particular,
( )
( )
( )
the sets C* µ f , C* µ c and C* µ a may contain an element * (any possible) to be used
if some characteristics of data files or records are not fixed by the users. The subset
( )
( )
R µ ⊆ IRS µ characterising information needs of the user(s) can be used in two
( )
ways: 1) for information retrieval in LDB µ , and 2) for actualisation of local
(µ)
(µ)
information resources (LIR ) in LDB .
( )

( )

( )

492

J.L. Kulikowski

LIR µ is also a subset of IRS µ . An information retrieval order can be realised if a
( )
( )
certain consistency level between R µ and LIR µ is reached, otherwise it is necessary
to import the necessary data from the OADB’s. However, the managers of LDBs may
conduct a more active policy of users’ requirements realisation. This can be reached
( )
( )
by a permanent monitoring of the information requirements flow: … R µ (t-3), R µ (t(µ)
(µ)
2), R (t-1), R (t) (t being the current time) in order to define a preferable local
( )
resources profile. The last for the given LDB µ can be defined as a subset
( )

( )

Λ µ ⊆ C*
( )

(µ)
f

× C* (µ)c

(7)

such that if LIR µ = Λ µ then a considerable part of expected information
requirements can be directly realised. The managers of LDBs try to achieve this
situation within their possibilities as it will be shown below.

3 Strategies for OADB Managers
The OADBs’ and LDBs’ managers are interested in realisation of information
requirements of their customers. The managers of OADBs are customers on the IS
market and, at the same time, they are data sellers with respect to the managers of
LDBs. On the other hand, the last ones are data suppliers for the information users.
Buying a document xi available on IS market needs covering a cost κi being indicated
as a component of the corresponding document characteristic. The same document
( )
(or data drawn from it) included into the information resources of OADB ν is expected
to be distributed among a number of LDBs to the information profiles of which it
( )
( )
suits. As a consequence, the manager of OADB ν expects to reach proceeds of ri ν .
Finally, its expected profit from buying and distributing xi is
ci ν = ri ν - κi
( )

( )

(8)

It might seem that there is a simple decision rule for the OADB ν manager:
( )

(9)
where ei ν is a threshold. However, there arise the following problems: 1 how to
( )
( )
o
( )
evaluate ci ν (or ri ν , see (8)), and 2 how to establish ei ν ?
For answering the first question there can be made the following assumptions:
( )
a/ expected proceeds ri ν can be described by an increasing function of the number
( )
of customers whose information profiles Λ µ are consistent with the information
characteristics hi of xi and of a total measure of this consistency;
( )
b/ the information profiles Λ µ of the LDBs are not known exactly to the manager
(ν )
( )
of OADB , he can only approximate them in the form of information profile L ν
constructed on the basis of all past and actual information requirements from the
LDBs;
( )
c/ ri ν is a decreasing function of other OADBs in the ID system that will offer xi
and/or some secondary information drawn from it.
( )

o

493

Then, it arises the next problem: how to evaluate the measure of consistency
( )
between a document characteristic hi and the profile of L ν , assuming that (3) holds
(ν )
(ν )
( )
( )
and hi ∈ C f × C c. Let us remark that in general the elements of C ν f × C ν c are not
vectors in algebraic sense, but rather some strings of elementary data of various
formal nature. Therefore, it is not possible to take an ordinary distance measure
concept as a basis of a consistency measure definition. However, the last can be based
on a generalised, multi-aspect similarity measure concept proposed in [8]. In this
case, if A is a non-empty set, then a similarity measure between its elements can be
defined as a function:
(10)
σ: A × A → [0,1]c
where [p,q]c denotes a continuous interval between p and q, such that: a/ for each a ∈
A there is σ(a,a) ≡ 1; b/ for any a, b ∈ A there is σ(a,b) ≡ σ(b,a); c/ for any a, b, c ∈ A
there is σ(a,c) ≥ σ(a,b) ⋅ σ(b,c).

If f = [f 1, f 2,…, f γ,…, f g] and f = [f 1, f 2,…, f γ,…, f g] are two strings of
characteristics whose components are of various formal nature then a measure of
multi-aspect similarity can be defined as a product:
σ( f , f ) = σ1( f 1, f 1) ⋅ σ2(f 2, f 2) ⋅ … ⋅ σg( f g, f g)

This definition can be used directly to the similarity evaluation of documents
characteristics. Let σ(hi, hj) be a similarity measure described on the Cartesian
( )
( )
product A = C ν f × C ν c. Then it will be said that a member hi, hi ∈ A is adherent to a
(ν )
subset L ⊆ A on a level ε, 0 < ε ≤ 1, if there is at least one element hj ∈ A such that
ε ≤ σ( hi, hj) ≤ 1. Here ε is a threshold chosen according to the application
requirements.
( )
Adherence of hi to L ν on a fixed level is necessary, but not a sufficient condition
( )
for making a positive decision according to the rule (9). For this purpose the OADB ν
o
(ν )
manager should also take into account: 1 how many characteristics hj in L , for all
o
possible hj, satisfy the adherence condition, 2 how many customers have declared
o
their interests in acquiring the data characterised by hj, and 3 how long time has been
passed since the last call for hj. The corresponding, additional data can be stored and
included into the information requirement characteristics (see (6)). Taking them into
( )
( )
account a measure of consistency Γ(hi, L ν ) between hi and L ν can be defined as it
will be illustrated below.
Let us assume that the contents of documents are characterised by keywords that
are presented in a linear order: w1, w2, w3, … , etc. Let us take into account two
documents, whose characteristics hi, and hj contain, correspondingly, the subsets of
keywords Wi and Wj, There will be considered the sets: Wi ∪ Wj, and Wi ∩ Wj, If the
cardinal number of a set W is denoted by |W| then the similarity measure of the abovementioned sets can be defined as

σ (W i , W j ) =

Wi ∩ Wj

(12)

Wi ∪ Wj

This similarity measure can be taken as a basis of the Γ(hi, L ν ) definition. First, let us
( )
remark that L ν can be formally interpreted as a virtual document consisting of all
documents whose characteristics were in the past required by a considerable part of
customers. Therefore, the formula (12) can be used for evaluation of similarity
( )

494

J.L. Kulikowski

between hi and L ν , as well. Let us suppose that in the given OADB ν the requirements
are registered in such a way that to any keyword wα there are assigned the numbers
eα,τ, τ = 0,1,2,…,T indicating how many times wα was mentioned in the information
calls in the present (τ = 0), as well as in the former time-periods (years). Then the
following weight coefficient:
( )

( )

T

λ α=∑
τ =0

eα , τ
τ +1

(13)

and, at last we can put
Γ(hi, L ν ) = σ( hi, L ν ) ⋅ λα
( )

( )

(14)

where the sum λα on the right side is taken over all keywords occurring both in hi and
( )
( )
L ν . The manager of OADB ν thus can assume a proportionality:
ci ν = k ⋅ Γ(hi, L ν )
( )

( )

(15)

(k being a positive coefficient of proportionality) meaning that the greater is the
( )
consistency measure between hi and the profile L ν , the higher are the expected
proceeds from selling information drawn from xi. However, in the situation when the
supply of xi on the market is high (i.e. > 1) the same document can be bought and
distributed by other OADBs. In such case, assuming that the number of LDBs
interested in acquiring xi is unchanged, the incomes of the OADBs will be inversely
proportional to the number of OADBs acquiring xi. Therefore, the managers of
OADBs in this case play a competitive game with fixed positive total gain. They may
all acquire the given document; in such case, if they do it at the same time, they will
share the gain proportionally to the number of customers that will require access to
data from the document. However, the number of OADBs buying the document a
( )
priori is not known. In such case the manager of OADB ν may, first, delay his
decision in order to recognise the actions of other players. However, if the delay is
large then the expected proceeds will be reduced as well.
The risk of acquiring documents which will not be needed by the customers may
be not accessible for the OADBs’ managers. In such case they may change the game
rules by establishing a coalition among them. The coalition consists in specialization
( )
of their information resources so that the information profiles L ν are (at least,
approximately) disjoint. As a consequence, the OADBs will share the information
requirements of the customers according to their contents. In such case the expected
incomes of the OADBs lose the factor of uncertainty connected with the number of
competitive OADBs offering access to the same documents.

4 Strategies for LDB Managers
The relationships between the LDB managers and the information users is not the
same as this one between the OADBs’ and LDBs’ managers. The difference consists
in the fact that the LDBs’ managers and their information users usually act within the
same organisations Therefore, up to a certain degree their interests are convergent.
However, a source of conflicts may be connected with the fact that the LDBs’

Creation of Information Profiles in Distributed Databases as a n-Person Game

495

manager has at his disposal a limited amount of financial resources that can be used
to a realisation of information requirements of his clients. In such case he must
establish a system of priorities in acquiring new data from the OADBs. As a
( )
consequence, the users attached to a certain LDB µ may have partially common and
partially competitive interests. Assuming that the LDBs’ manager has no reason for
distinguishing some information users against some other ones he will try to make his
( )
decisions on basis of the information profile Λ µ . His problem is thus as follows: 1)
He has at his disposal an amount ζ of financial means that he can spent for extending
( )
( )
the LIR µ for a certain time T*; 2) He knows the actual information requirements R µ
(µ)
of his clients (data users) that can not be realised on the basis of LIR ; 3) He knows
the actual information resources of the OADBs as well as the corresponding data
selling and/or data access conditions.
How to realise the information needs of the clients within the financial and/or
formal limits?
It is assumed that the prices of an incidental access to some data and of data buying
for their permanent using within the organisation are different (the last being usually
much higher). Therefore, if an analysis of the OADBs’ resources shows that a certain
requirement can be realised by importing data then it is necessary to determine the
expected costs of: a/ data buying and b/ data access during the time-interval T* for
various OADBs and to find out the minimum ones. At the next step the conflict of
interests of various clients should be solved: it has been determined a set of data
acquisition offers: O1, O2, O3,… etc., each one being characterised by its expected cost
χι and by the subset of clients that might be interested in using the given data in the
time-interval T*. The problem is: how to select a subset of the offers for their final
acceptation?
The problem can be solved if a system of ordering the offers is defined. Each offer
o
can be characterised by a vector whose components indicate: 1 the expected cost χι,
o
o
2 the number bι of clients that are interested in using the given data, and 3 the mean
measure of similarity sι of the offered data to the actual (and expected, if possible)
data requirements. Therefore, it arises the problem of semi-ordering of the vectors uι
= [χι, bι, sι] in a three-dimensional space. The problem can be solved easily on the
basis of K-space (Kantorovich space) concept [9]. Then the strategy of the LDB
manager consists in rearranging the offers: Oρ1, Oρ2, Oρ3, etc. (ρ1, ρ1, ρ1, etc. being some
integers) and in accepting for realisation as much offers as possible within the
financial limits.

5 Conclusions
We tried to show that the relationships between the managers of OADBs and of LDBs
have the form of a n-person game of partially co-operative, partially non-co-operative
type with incomplete information. It is possible to define the strategies of the players.
The strategies are realised by creation of database profiles that are used in making
decisions concerning documents or data acquisition. The decision rules of the players
can be strongly optimised only in particular, rather simple cases. In general, it has
been shown that a co-operation between the database managers may them lead to less
risk in reaching their goals.
