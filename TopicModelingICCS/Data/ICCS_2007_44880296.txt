Abstract. This is a systematic gas phase study of the gauche and trans conformers of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane. The methods used are second order
Møller-Plesset theory (MP2) and density functional theory (DFT). The basis set
used is 6-311++G(d,p) for all atoms. The functional used for DFT method is
B3LYP. G2/MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations have also been carried out using
MP2 optimised structure. The results indicate that there is more preference for
the trans conformer. The energy difference between the trans and gauche conformers (ΔEtg) and related rotational thermodynamics are reported. The MP2/6311++G(d,p) energy difference (ΔEtg) for 1-bromo-2-chloroethane is 7.08
kJ/mol. The conformers of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane have also been subjected to
vibrational analysis. This study has also been extended to investigate solvent effects using the Self-Consistent Reaction Field methods. The structures of the
conformers are not much affected by the solvents but the energy difference
(ΔEtg) decreases with increasing polarity of the solvent. The results from the
different theoretical methods are in good agreement.

1 Introduction
100 years ago, Bischoff found that C-C single bond in ethane is not completely free
[1]. Due to the hindered internal rotation, 1,2-disubstituted ethanes are the simplest
molecules showing conformational isomerism thus leading to the gauche and trans
conformers. It is generally found that the trans conformer is more stable than the
gauche form and this is due to steric hindrance in the gauche conformation [2]. Theoretical calculations of the energy difference between the trans and gauche conformers
(ΔEtg) have been actively pursued for over 40 years, as they are important parameters
to the conformational analysis of molecules [3].
In previous communications, energy differences (ΔEtg) have been calculated for
1,2-dihaloethanes (XCH2CH2X, X=F, Cl, Br and I) [4] and for 1-fluoro-2-haloethanes
(FCH2CH2X, X=Cl, Br and I) [5] in the gas phase. These studies indicate that except
for 1,2-difluoroethane, the trans conformer is more stable that the gauche conformer.
The energy difference (ΔEtg) increases with the size of the halogen. The atypical

behaviour of 1,2-difluoroethane has been associated with the gauche effect [6-10] but
the latter is not observed for the 1-fluoro-2-haloethanes. Solvent effects have also
been explored for 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane [11]. The study indicates
that an increase in the solvent polarity decreases the energy difference (ΔEtg). It is
worth to point out at this stage that literature involving theoretical studies is limited
with respect to solvent effects [11,12] although polarity of the solvent is known to
affect conformational equilibrium [13].
As part of a continuing series of studies on internal rotation [4-5,11], 1-bromo-2chloroethane has been the target of this work. 1-Bromo-2-chloroethane, being a 1,2disubstituted ethane, can exist as the gauche (C1 symmetry) and trans (Cs symmetry)
conformers as illustrated in Figure 1.

These gauche and trans conformers of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane have been studied
with a view to obtain (i) the optimised structural parameters, (ii) the energy difference (ΔEtg) and (iii) related thermodynamics properties for torsional rotation. Apart
from energy calculations, the conformers of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane have also been
subjected to vibrational analysis. Solvent effects, using Self-Consistent Reaction
Field (SCRF) methods [14], have also been explored with the dielectric constant
of the solvent varying from 5 to 40. The results of the present investigation are reported herein and to the best of our knowledge there has not been such a type of
investigation.

2 Calculations
All the calculations have been carried out using Gaussian 03W [15] program suite
and GaussView 3.0 [16] has been used for visualising the molecules. The calculations
have been carried out using second order MØller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)
and density functional theory (DFT). The basis set used is 6-311++G(d,p) for all
atoms. The functional used for DFT method is B3LYP. A conformer has first been
optimised and the optimised structure has then been used for frequency calculation
using the same method and basis set involved for optimisation. G2/MP2 and

298

CCSD(T) calculations have also been carried out using MP2/6-311++G(d,p)
optimised structure. For all the converged structures, frequencies calculations have
also been carried out in order to ensure that this conformation corresponds to a
minimum. The SCRF methods used are Isodensity Model (SCRF=IPCM) [14] and
Self-Consistent Isodensity Model (SCRF=SCIPCM) [14]. MP2/6-311++G(d,p) gas
phase optimised structures have been used for the single point calculations for the
Isodensity Model and B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) full geometry optimisation calculations
have been carried for the Self-Consistent Isodensity Model.

3 Results and Discussion
The optimised structural parameters, which are of interest for the two conformers of
1-bromo-2-chloroethane, are summarised in Table 1. Analysis of Table 1 allows some
conclusions to be made. Firstly, for both conformers the predicted C-Cl and C-Br
bond lengths are longer from B3LYP calculation although the C-C and C-H bond
lengths are nearly same. Secondly the bond angles CCCl and CCBr are larger for the
gauche conformer than the trans conformer. This can be explained in terms of greater
amount of steric repulsion between the halogen atoms in the gauche conformation.
Further these bond angles are larger from B3LYP calculation. However, these bond
angles are nearly same for the trans conformer for both methods. Thirdly, the torsional angle ClCCBr for the gauche conformer is larger from B3LYP calculation.
Lastly the moments of inertia are generally greater from MP2 calculation with
IA > IB ≈ IC.

The energies of the gauche and trans conformers of the 1-bromo-2-chloroethane
are given in Table 2. These energies have been obtained after full geometry optimisation which has been verified by frequency calculation. G2/MP2 and CCSD(T) energies are also given in Table 2. As part of G2/MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations, MP2/6311+G(3df,2p) and MP3/6-311++G(d,p) energies are included in Table 2. The energy
difference (ΔEtg) and related rotational thermodynamic parameters are also summarised in Table 2. A glance at Table 2 clearly shows that the trans conformer is more
stable. The energy difference (ΔEtg) predicted using B3LYP method is greater than
MP2 method for the same basis set. The free energy difference (ΔGtg) can be used to
estimate the relative percentage of the trans and gauche conformers. It is found that at
298 K, the percentage of the trans conformer is generally greater than 90%. At this
stage, it is interesting to compare the energy difference (ΔEtg) of the unsymmetrical
1-bromo-2-chloroethane with the symmetrical 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2dibromoethane. The MP2/6-311++G(d,p) values for these compounds are 6.08 and
8.79 kJ/mol respectively [4].

The gauche and trans conformers of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane have also been
subjected to vibrational analysis. The calculated frequencies are reported in Table 3
and the simulated spectra are illustrated in Figure 2. The 18 modes of vibrations
account for the irreducible representations Γv = 18A of the C1 point group of the
gauche conformer and Γv = 11A′ + 7A″ of the Cs point group of the trans conformer.
All the 18 fundamentals of the gauche and trans conformers have been assigned
appropriately. The values indicate that predictions with MP2 level of theory are
systematically larger than B3LYP level of theory. Since steric interaction between
the atoms is more in the gauche than trans conformer, the CCCl and CCBr bending
modes have higher frequencies in the gauche conformation than the trans conformation. The bending vibrational modes of the CH2 group are in the order scissoring >
wagging > twisting > rocking. The bending mode of the CH2 group attached to bromine atom is at a lower frequency compared to CH2 group attached to chlorine atom.
This can be explained on the basis of reduced mass for CH2 group when attached
to bromine atom. However the stretching vibrational modes of the CH2 group bonded
to the halogen atoms are reversed in terms of frequency. The calculated frequentcies for 1-bromo-2-chloroethane are in agreement with literature values obtained
experimentally [17].

This study has also been extended to study solvent effects. The structures of the
conformers are not much affected by the polarity of the polarity of the solvents. The
effects of solvent on the energy of the gauche and trans conformers and energy difference (ΔEtg) are summarised in Table 4 and illustrated in Figure 3. It can be found that
solvent effects are small but they can be calculated and an increase in the polarity of

decrease in the energy of the more polar gauche conformer is larger than the trans
conformer.

4 Conclusions
This theoretical study has lead to the determination of the optimised structural
parameters, the energy difference (ΔEtg) and related thermodynamics parameters for
1-bromo-2-chloroethane. The results indicate that there is a preference for the trans
conformer both in the gaseous and solution phases. The calculated frequencies of the
conformers are in agreement with literature values. The energy difference (ΔEtg) decreases as the solvent becomes more polar. The results of this study may be used as a
set of reference for the conformers of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane.
