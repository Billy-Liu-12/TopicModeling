Abstract. A heuristic particle swarm optimization (HPSO) is proposed
as a solution to one-dimensional cutting stock problem (1D-CSP), which
incorporate genetic operators into particle swarm optimization (PSO).
In this paper, a heuristic strategy that is based on the results of analysis
of the optimal cutting pattern of particles with successful search processes is described, which process a global optimization problem of the
cutting-stock as a sequential optimization problem by multiple stages.
During every sequential stage, the best cutting pattern for the current
situation is researched and processed. This strategy is repeated until all
the required stocks have been generated. The simulation results prove
the eﬀectiveness of the proposed methodology.
Keywords: Heuristic particle swarm optimization, One-dimensional

Introduction

The one-dimensional cutting stock problem (1D-CSP) is one of the representative combinatorial optimization problems, which arises in many industries [1].
This paper proposes a heuristic particle swarm optimization (HPSO) incorporating genetic algorithm (GA). The main idea of HPSO is to process a global
optimization problem of the cutting-stock as a sequential optimization problem
by multiple stages. During every sequential stage, the best cutting pattern for
the current situation is researched and processed. This stage processing is repeated until all the required stocks have been generated. The experiment result
shows that the HPSO can obtain satisfying eﬀect.

One-Dimensional Cutting Stock Problem

In the pattern-oriented approach, at ﬁrst, order lengths are combined into cutting
patterns, however, it is impractical to consider all feasible cutting patterns, and

we would try to ﬁnd a set of n better cutting patterns yielding small deviations
from the order demands. In a succeeding step, the frequencies are determined
that are necessary to satisfy the order demands.
One of the most important costs for 1D-CSP is the amount of residual pieces
of processed stock, called trim loss, which are usually treated as waste product.
Hence, the problem of minimizing the total trim loss (or the number of processed
stock) is considered as the most important factor.
To deﬁne 1D-CSP, it is given a suﬃcient number of stocks, which have the
same length L, and m types of products with given lengths (l1 , l2 , ..., lm ) and their
demands (d1 , d2 , . . . , dm ). A cutting pattern is a combination of products cut
from a stock. A cutting pattern is described as pj = (a1j , a2j , ..., amj ), where aij
is the number of product i cut from one stock roll. It is suppose that have found
n type optimal cutting patterns, the ﬁrst cutting pattern is cut the quantity of
the m-th type product is am1 , and its the trim loss is b1 . The second cutting
pattern is cut the quantity of the m-th type product is am2 , and its the trim loss
of the second is b2 . Thus, the cutting pattern n is cut the quantity of the m-th
type product is amn , and its the trim loss is bn [2]. The mathematics model of
one-dimensional cutting stock problem is formulated as follows:
⎡
⎤
a11 a12 . . . a1n
⎢ a21 a22 . . . a2n ⎥
⎥
A=⎢
(1)
⎣ ... ... ... ... ⎦
am1 am2 . . . amn
The number of stock that use n type diﬀerent cutting pattern is as follow:
X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )T

(2)

The trim loss of cutting pattern pj is as follows.
bj = L − (a1j l1 + a2j l2 + ... + amj lm )

j = 1, 2, ..., n

(3)

Where amj is the number of m-th type product that use cutting pattern pj . Now
the object function of the pattern-oriented approach is formulated as follows.
n

f (x) = min(

bj xj )

(4)

j=1

The last stock has the maximum remainder and can in general be used further,
thus it is not considered as waste. The summation of trim loss in one-dimensional
cutting stock problem should be subtracted the remainder of the last stock.

f (x) = min(

j=1

Where L denotes indicate the longest remainder of a cutting plan which cumulate consecutive residual lengths in one stock which could be used later.

Heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization

PSO is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. The information exchange
takes place only among the particle’s own experience and the experience of the
best particle in the swarm. HPSO model is still based on PSO mechanism, but
use genetic operator as the updating operator. The best position of each particle
would update by crossover operator and mutation operator.
In heuristic particle swarm optimization, each potential optimal cutting plan,
called a particle, the current position of the particle is denoted xti . The particles have memory and each particle keep track of its previous best position
(denoted xbestti ) and its corresponding ﬁtness. The particle with greatest ﬁtness
is called the global best and its position is called the global best position (gbest).
Each particle towards it’s xbestti and the gbest position. The current number of
iteration generation is represented by the symbol t.
The main steps in HPSO Process are described as follows:
Step 1. Initialize the swarm randomly.
Step 2. For each particle of swarm, Choose xti and xbestti , and generate xit by
crossover operator.
Step 3. For each particle of swarm, Choose xit and xgbest , and generate xi t
by crossover operator.
by mutation
Step 4. For each particle of swarm, Choose xi t , and generate xt+1
i
operator.
Step 5. Calculate the ﬁtness each particle.
Step 6. Update the best position of each particle so far.
Step 7. Update the global best position of the whole swarm so far.
Step 8. Repeat Step 2 to Step 6, Choose the best cutting pattern for the
current situation.
Step 9. Process cutting stocks by the best cutting pattern, subtract the quantities of the every type pieces that have been cut, and then update each particle
of swarm.
Step 10. If all the required stocks have been not generated, go to step 2.
Step 11. Output the ﬁnal results of HPSO.

Experiments Results

One of the most important costs for 1D-CSP is the amount of residual pieces of
processed stock, called trim loss. The purpose of HPSO is that search a cutting
plan that has the least trim loss The benchmark instance was given in [3]. The
optimal cutting plan was given in [3] by a hybrid genetic algorithm which the
longest remainder of stock is 2746mm. The total trim loss of other stocks is
2411mm.
According to the results in Table.1, HPSO has attained a satisfying optimal
cutting plan. The optimal cutting plan is given in table 1 which the longest
remainder of stock is 133mm. The total trim loss of other stocks is 163mm. The
average availability ratio of other stocks is 99.86%. The result is satisfactory that
overall stocks needed by all cuts are minimized.
