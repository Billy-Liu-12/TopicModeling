Abstract. People usually use arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method
to simulate the multi-phase ﬂowing problems, but some numerical errors may be introduced during remapping. In this paper, sliding free
Lagrangian-Eulerian ﬁnite element method(SFLEFEM) is developed. In
SFLEFEM compressible Eulerian equations for moving mesh are dircretized without Lagrangian step and numerical experiments prove that
SFLEFEM is convergent and stable.

Description

In Lagrangian approach, the mesh is embedded in the ﬂuid and moves with it, So
the precise material interface can be aﬀorded. But when dealing with complex
ﬂuid, the mesh may be distorted seriously, the computation errors will increase
quickly so that the computation is stopped. For solving the problem, people usually use rezoning and remapping techniques, but some errors may be introduced.
So people can’t use the rezoning and remapping techniques frequently.
In Eulerian approach, the mesh of grid points is ﬁxed and so it can be used to
calculate the problem of large deformation. Because the mesh is ﬁxed, many other
techniques, such as VOF[1], Front tracking[2], Level set[3] and Phase ﬁeld[4], are
used to track the moving material interface. But the precision of their capturing
interface is lower than that of Lagrangian approach.
Because of these shortcomings, we introduce Sliding Free Lagrangian Eulerian
Finite Element Method (SFLEFEM). Our objective is to deal with multimaterial physics problems with large-deformation and sliding interface. Numerical results show that SFLEFEM can simulate the multi-material problems with
large-deformation and also can capture the material interface precisely.
SFLEFEM is diﬀerent from Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian(ALE) method. In
ALE method, a Lagrangian step is ﬁrst performed and the mesh is deformed
according to the ﬂuid ﬂow. Then the improved mesh is generated based on the
Lagrangian mesh and the solution is transferred from the Lagrangian mesh to
the improved mesh. In SFLEFEM, a Lagrangian step is never performed. We
directly calculate the ﬂuid ﬁeld from the time tn to the time tn+1 . Moreover, the

grid points on the material interface or the boundary must move at the speed of
Lagrangian velocity in the normal direction and can slide freely in the tangential
direction. The tangential movement of boundary points can help us to generate
the mesh of high quality.
In SFLEFEM, every material is calculated separately and the interaction between two neighboring materials is calculated by a new contact algorithm which
is based on TENSOR contact algorithm. We will describe it in the future.
The equations of SFLEFEM are unsteady compressible Eulerian equations for

Examples

Saltzman piston problem[7] is used to test the ability of code to simulate the
shock waves that are oblique to the mesh. Exact results for the problem are
that the third shock arrives at the z coordinate of 0.95 and densities in front
of and behind the third shock are 10 and 20 respectively. The pure Lagrangian
methods(PLM) and SFLEFEM are used to simulate the problem and the results
obtained from these two methods at time t=0.925 are showed in Fig. 1.

The ﬁgure of one-dimensional shock obtained from PLM is distorted seriously,
especially along the top and bottom boundaries. But the density contours obtained from SFLEFEM give the right position of the shock and almost completely
planar shock and the smaller density errors.
Dukowicz problem[7] is a shock refraction problem on an inclined interface
and its sketch map is showed in Fig. 2. A piston moves from left to right with
the constant velocity of 1.48. On the right of the piston there are two ideal gases,
the interface between two gases is aligned at 30◦ to the horizontal.

The initial mesh is composed of two adjacent regions. The left region is a
36 × 30 mesh and the right region a 40 × 30 uniform mesh slanted at 60◦ . The
density contours obtained by PLM and SFLEFEM are showed in Fig. 3 and Fig.
4 respectively at time t=1.3. They are almost same as the density contours in
[7]. The main diﬀerence is where the interface arrives at on the lower boundary.
We also use the reﬁner mesh (72 × 60 zones in the left region and 80 × 60
zones in the right region) to calculate the problem. The interface location on
the lower boundary at time t=1.3 are showed in table 1. Table 1 shows the
interface location from SFLEFEM is same even if using diﬀerent mesh. That
shows SFLEFEM is convergent.

Noh problem[7] is used to test the ability of the code to keep symmetrization.
In Noh problem, an ideal gas moves in an initial unit inward radial velocity. Exact
solution and results obtained from PLM and SFLEFEM with a polar mesh of 50×
50 are showed in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows two methods give the right shock location
and they can keep the circular shock the almost complete symmetrization, but
the density errors of SFLEFEM are smaller.

Summary and Discussion

SFLEFEM has both the character of Lagrangian approach and the attribute
of Euler approach. In SFLEFEM grid points can move free, which does not
introduce new numerical errors. Capturing the shock waves and the interface
precisely and decreasing the density errors prove the eﬃciency of SFLEFEM.
But the more development of SFLEFEM is necessary, especially for the time
discretization of momentum equations. We will use high order R-K methods to
discretize the time derivatives in the momentum equations in future.
