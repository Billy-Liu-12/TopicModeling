Abstract. In this paper we will prove that every simple claw-free graph
G with the minimum degree at least two such that each of its odd branchbonds contains a branch of length one has an even factor of degree 2 or 4.
Some examples showed the conclusion can not be replaced by “2-factor”
even for 2-connected graphs.
Keywords: even factor, claw-free graph, branch-bond.

Introduction

All graphs considered in this paper are simple graphs. For the notations or
terminologies not deﬁned here, see [1].
A factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph. A connected spanning subgraph
is called a connected factor. A even factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph
of G such that it has only even positive degree vertices. A 2-factor of a graph G
is a spanning subgraph such that it has only degree 2 vertices. An even factor
of G is called an even [2, 4]-factor if the degree of every vertex is either 2 or 4.
Clearly, a hamiltonian graph has a 2-factor with exactly one component. There
are many results on the existence of the factors with some properties, for the
connected factors, see the updated survey papers [5] and [6].
From the results of Choudum and Paulraj [2], and Egawa and Ota [3], one can
deduce that every claw-free graph with minimum degree at least 4 has a 2-factor.
Very recently, Yoshimoto show that the minimum degree can be reduced if we
increase its connectivity.
Theorem 1. (Yoshimoto, [11]) Every 2-connected claw-free graph G such that
δ(G) ≥ 3 has a 2-factor.

A nontrivial path is called a branch if it has only internal vertices of degree
two and end vertices of degree not two. The length of a branch is the number
of its edges. Note that a branch of length one has no internal vertex. A set
B of branches of G is called a branch cut if the subgraph of G obtained from
G[E(G) \ B∈B E(B)] by deleting all internal vertices in any branch of B has
more components than G. A minimal branch cut is called a branch-bond. A
branch-bond is called odd if it has an odd number of branches. The idea of
branch-bond is from [9] which has also been applied in [4] and [10].
If G is a graph such that it has an odd branch-bond with a shortest branch
of length 2, then clearly G has no even factor. However our result shows that
every graph in which every branch-bond has a shortest branch of length one has
an even factor.
Theorem 2. Let G be a claw-free graph with δ(G) ≥ 2 such that every odd
branch-bond of G contains a branch of length one. Then G has an even [2, 4]factor.
Let G0 be the graph in Figure 1. Then G0 has no 2-factor since the two vertices
of degree 2 in the cycle of length 8 must be in the same cycle of a possible 2factor but then the vertices of degree 2 having distance 2 must be in a component
of maximum degree 4. Note that G0 satisﬁes the condition of Theorem 2. This
shows that Theorem 2 is best possible in a sense that the conclusion in Theorem 2
can not be replaced by “2-factor”. Note that G0 is 2-connected. This shows that
Theorem 2 is best possible even if the graph is 2-connected.

Proof of Theorem 2

We start with the following lemma which is a special case of a result in [8].
Lemma 3. (Li and Xiong [8], Lai, Li, Shao and Xiong [7]) Let G be a clawfree graph. If G has a connected even factor H, then G has a connected even
[2, 4]-factor.

For subgraphs H ⊂ F , let IntF H = {u ∈ V (H) | dF (u) = 1}. A circuit is a
connected graph with at least three vertices in which every vertex has even degree.
Proof of Theorem 2. Let G be a graph in Theorem 2. Then we have the
following fact.
Claim 1. G has a set of vertex-disjoint circuits containing all branches of length
not 1.
Proof of Claim 1. Let C1 , C2 , . . . , Ct be vertex-disjoint circuits in G such that
C = i≤t Ci contains branches of length not equal to one as many as possible.
Let F = G − V (C), and suppose F contains a branch of G with length not one,
say P . Hence P has no end-vertex of degree one in G. Since IntG (P ) ⊂ V (F ),
E(P ) ⊂ E(G) \ E(C). Let T be a maximal tree such that P ⊂ T and
if there is an edge e in T ∩C, then e is in a branch of G with length one. (2.1)
If we remove all edges and the internal vertices of P from T , then two trees T1
and T2 remain. Let B be a branch-bond of G joining T1 and G − V (T1 ) ∪ IntP (P )
in which P is one of branches.
We choose a branch B of G in B as follows. If B \ P has a branch of G which is
edge-disjoint to C, then let B be the branch. In the case that B \ P has no such
a branch, B is an odd branch-bond, and so B has a shortest branch of length
one. We choose the shortest branch as B. Notice that if E(B) ∩ E(C) = ∅, then
B is a branch of length one. In either case, because of the maximality of T , B is
joining T1 and T2 , and so T ∪ B contains a cycle D. Then
C = ((C ∪ D) \ E(C ∩ D)) − IntC∩D (C ∩ D)
is a set of circuits. Because P ⊂ C and any vertex in IntC∩D (C ∩ D) is contained in a branch of length one by (2.1), the set C of the circuits contains more
branches of length not equal to one than C, a contradiction. This completes the
proof of Claim 1.
By Claim 1, we can choose vertex-disjoint circuits C1 , C2 , · · · , Ck such that
1. C = i≤k Ci contains all edges in any branch of length not equal to one;
2. Subject to 1, |V (C)| is maximal;
3. Subject to the above, k is as small as possible.
We claim that C is a spanning subgraph of G. First we claim that G − C
has no cycle for otherwise we will obtain a set of circuits contains bigger k after
adding a cycle of G−C. Now it suﬃces to prove that C contains all vertices of G.
We will prove this by contradiction. If possible, suppose that x ∈ V (G) \ V (C).
By Claim 1, dG (x) ≥ 3. Let y1 , y2 and y3 be three vertices in NG (x). Since G
is claw-free, there exists an edge between two of {y1 , y2 , y3 }, say, y1 y2 ∈ E(G).

We obtain a new C from C by replacing y1 y2 with y1 xy2 if y1 y2 ∈ E(C) and by
adding y1 y2 x otherwise. Note that C satisﬁes 1. But C contains more vertices
than C, a contradiction.
Since G is claw-free, G[Ci ] is also claw-free. Note that it has an connected
even factor Ci . By Lemma 3, G[Ci ] has a connected even [2, 4]-factor. Hence G
has an even factor with degree at most 4. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.
