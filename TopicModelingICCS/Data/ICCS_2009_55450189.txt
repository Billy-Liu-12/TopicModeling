Abstract. The charge recombination rate in DNA hairpins is investigated. The distance dependence for the charge recombination rate between stilbene donor (Sd+ ) and stilbene acceptor (Sa− ) linkers separated
by an AT bridge has a double exponential form. We suggest that this dependence is associated with two tunneling channels distinguished by the
presence or absence of the Cl− counterion bound to Sd+ . Experimentbased estimates of counterion binding parameters agree within reasonable expectations. A control experiment replacing the Cl− ion with other
halide ions is suggested. Counterion substitution allows modiﬁcation of
the charge recombination rate in either direction by orders of magnitude.
Keywords: DNA hairpin, charge transfer, counterions.

Introduction

Electronic excitation of DNA using various optical methods is important for
investigating DNA structure and biological function [1]. It also plays a fundamental role in a variety of DNA applications in nanotechnology which have been
extensively considered during the past decade [2], [3], [4], [5]. The ﬁrst timeresolved observation of charge transfer in DNA was made using stilbene capped
DNA hairpins (Fig.1) [6], which are used successfully in the investigation of DNA
electronic excitations and their kinetics. It is remarkable that hairpins with polyA poly-T bridges connecting stilbene acceptor (Sa) and donor (Sd) linkers (Fig.1)
can possess extremely long recombination times for the charge separated state
Sa− (AT)n Sd+ following Sa photoexcitation. Increasing the number of AT pairs
forming the bridge from n = 1 to n = 7 reduces the charge recombination rate by
eight orders of magnitude [7]. This interesting property of stilbene capped DNA
hairpins has potential for a variety of applications involving charge separation
such as solar cells [8].
Therefore, it is important to understand mechanisms of charge recombination
in DNA hairpins and investigate possible ways to control this process. This
requires understanding distance dependence of the charge transfer rate (1).

Kinetics Model

In this paper, the charge recombination rate in poly-A poly-T DNA hairpins [6] of
lengths n = 1 to n = 7 is investigated. It is shown that the charge recombination
rate for AT bridges as a function of distance r between Sd+ and Sa− has the
double exponential form
k (r) = k0 [exp (−β1 r) + C exp (−β2 r)] .

(1)

In our investigation, we consider the hairpin in its environment of a dilute aqueous solution of NaCl. In our model, we propose that this double exponential
behavior is associated with two distinguishable charge separated states for the
hairpin. State 1 is the state where Cl− is attached to Sd+ and state 2 is the
state where Sd+ is isolated, that is where Sd+ only has water molecules nearby.
Let Δ denote the energy diﬀerence between states 1 and 2, with the phase volume Ω >> 1 for state 2, as Cl− is dilute in water. Let P1 and P2 represent the
probabilities of the hairpin occupying states 1 and 2 respectively. Consider time
t = 0 as the time of hole arrival at Sd.
The time evolution of these two probabilities is determined by two processes
including hole recombination with rates k1 and k2 from states 1 and 2 respectively and ﬂuctuation of the system between states 1 and 2 with rates w12 and
w21 for transitions 1 → 2 and 2 → 1 respectively. Rates w12 and w21 characterize the process of counterion dissociation and association respectively. For
thermal equilibrium probabilities P1∗ and P2∗ , they must satisfy the detailed
balance principle
(2)
P1∗ w12 = P2∗ w21 .
As P2 is the probability that the Cl− counterion is not bound to Sd+ , we can
express the ratio of probabilities P2 /P1 as C, where
C = Ω exp (−Δ/kB T ) ,

so that
w12 = Cw21 .

(4)

The time dependence of P1 and P2 is determined by the rate equations

An experimentally observable parameter is survival probability P (t) = P1 (t) +
P2 (t). Its time decay characterizes the recombination rate.

where

b = w12 /(−λ2 + k2 + w21 ) .

(7)

The decay rates λ1 and λ2 are the solutions to the characteristic equation for (5)
and constants f1 and f2 are determined by initial conditions P1 (0) and P2 (0),
where the survival probability P (0) = P1 (0) + P2 (0) = 1. λ1 , λ2 , f1 and f2 are
determined to be

(9)

Now we assume recombination is slow; that is k1 , k2 < w12 + w21 . Indeed, using
the diﬀusion rate D ≈ 10−5 cm2 /s [9] and assuming that a counterion moves by
random jumps of 1˚
A, one can estimate that during the minimum recombination
time of 10 ns the counterion jumps approximately 1000 times, which should be
suﬃcient for the ion to access the bound state near the Sd+ group as [Cl− ]∼0.1M
(about 1 chloride ion per 500 water molecules). Thus the equilibration rate w =
w12 + w21 should exceed the hole recombination rates.

192

G.S. Blaustein et al.

Using our assumption, we can approximate the decay rates λ1,2 via Taylor
expansion by the lowest order in k1,2 /w as
w12 k2 + w21 k1
w12 + w21
λ2 ≈ w12 + w21 .
λ1 ≈

(10)

With this approximation, the solution of (5) reads
P1 (t)
P2 (t)

w21 /(w12 + w21 )
exp(−λ1 t)
w12 /(w12 + w21 )
P1 (0)w12 − P2 (0)w21 1
+
exp(−λ2 t) .
w12 + w21
−1

= (P1 (0) + P2 (0))

(11)

It follows that the derived survival probability can be expressed as
P (t) = P1 (t) + P2 (t) ≈ exp(−λt) .

(12)

Thus the observed decay rate can be well approximated by
λ1 =

w12 k2 + w21 k1
.
w12 + w21

(13)

Taking λ1 = k, (1) follows directly from (4) and (10) as the thermodynamic
average of the two state recombination rates. β1 and β2 are taken to be the
experimentally derived values 0.97˚
A−1 and 0.42˚
A−1 respectively [7].
A H¨
uckel model is used to describe charge tunneling from Sd+ to Sa− [10],[11].
This model should be reasonably relevant in the tunneling regime despite polaron
formation and possible environmental ﬂuctuations which can reduce the energy
barrier. We can then determine the electron overlap integral b for adjacent AT
base pairs. We assume that the thermal equilibrium of the counterion and the
Sd+ ion is established before recombination begins. This is justiﬁed by the large
diﬀusion rate of counterions in water: D ≈ 10−5 cm2 /s (see [9]).
According to our model, (3) is the probability that counterion Cl− is not
bound to the Sd+ group, where Δ is the binding energy and kB T = 0.026eV is
the thermal energy at room temperature. Experiments [7] were performed in a
0.1M aqueous solution of NaCl. The prefactor Ω can be estimated as the ratio of
water molecules per chloride ion, so that Ω ∼ 556. The error of this estimate is
assumed to be less than an order of magnitude so we can consider 102 < Ω < 103 .
Lower and upper boundaries for Ω will be used to estimate the accuracy of our
estimate of the binding energy Δ. Solving (3) with the probability C taken from
experimental data [7] (see (1)), one ﬁnds
0.36eV < Δ < 0.42eV .

(14)

This estimate is within the range of typical counterion binding energies [12], [13].
In the next step, a relationship is derived between energies E1 and E2 of the
Sd+ linker in the presence and absence of Cl− respectively, and corresponding

tunneling exponents β1 and β2 in (1). The energy of an isolated (AT)+ is set to
zero. E1 < E2 implies that
E2 = E1 + Δ .
(15)
One can establish a clear relationship between energy and the tunneling exponent. This relationship involves the electron transfer integral b responsible for
charge tunneling between adjacent AT base pairs, shown in Fig.2. It can be
written as [10]
2b cosh(βi a/2) = Ei , i = 1, 2 ,
(16)
where a = 3.4˚
Ais the distance between adjacent base pairs.
This relationship can be derived as follows. The tunneling rate through n
AT pairs (cf. (1)) is determined by the exponential tail of the positive charge
wave function kn ∼ ψn2 . Here ψn2 is the probability of ﬁnding the charge at
the nth base pair. The wavefunction of the charge under the barrier decreases
exponentially with the base number as ψn ∼ exp(−κn), while the charge transfer
rate decreases exponentially with the bridge length as exp(−βan). Comparing
the two exponents, we have κ = βa/2. Equation (16) results from the discrete
Schr¨
odinger equation [10]
Eψn = −b(ψn−1 + ψn+1 )

(17)

if the exponential n dependence for ψn is assumed as above ( ψn ∼ exp(−κn)).
Using (14), (15) and (16), one can evaluate the electron transfer integral and
the energies of Sd+ in the absence or presence of Cl− as b = 0.13 ± 0.01eV, E1 =
0.73 ± 0.06eV and E2 = 0.34 ± 0.03eV. It is remarkable that the estimate for
the electron transfer integral b agrees very well with the calculations of Voityuk
and coworkers [14] for the coupling of adjacent thymine bases, but diﬀers from
the estimate for intrastrand coupling of adjacent adenine bases by a factor of 3.

194

G.S. Blaustein et al.

In principle, based on the ionization potentials of DNA bases calculated in a
vacuum [14,15,16], one should expect that the hole tunnels through the adjacent
adenine bases rather than the thymine bases because the adenine ionization
potential is lower by about 1eV. However, the real situation is complicated by the
dissolution of DNA in water, which can aﬀect ionization potential. Furthermore,
tunneling is also very sensitive to bridge ﬂuctuations [17]. The analysis of other
experimental data for charge transfer through AT bridges of various lengths [18]
can also be successful when only assuming electron transfer integrals to exceed
ab initio estimates for them.
It is not quite clear to us as to why there is no observation of thermally
activated recombination for (AT)n bridges up to n = 7 in contrast to Ref.[18].
A possible explanation of this behavior is edge eﬀect, which does not aﬀect
tunneling, but can be crucially important for thermally activated transport. For
instance, the energy of the AT+ state of an AT pair adjacent to an Sd linker can
be larger than the energy of other AT pairs due to its electrostatic interaction
with Sd. This diﬀerence can increase the activation energy of the ﬁrst hopping
step thus suppressing the hopping channel.
Another reason can be the diﬀerence of charge recombination [7] with charge
shift reactions [15]. For example, the investigation of charge recombination in
DNA hairpins using naphthaldimide and phenothiazine as acceptor and donor
separated by various AT bridges [19] exhibits behavior similar to Ref.[7]. Indeed,
a tunneling exponent β = 0.40˚
A−1 was reported for charge recombination across
4-8 AT base pairs. The small preexponential factor [19] (108 s−1 ) compared to k0
in (1) can be due to the fact that charge recombination for 4-8 base pairs also
occurs without associated counterions.

Discussion

Our model can be veriﬁed in a number of ways. One way is to change the NaCl
concentration. According to (1), the reduction of NaCl concentration by a factor
of ten will increase the recombination rate tenfold for long AT bridges (n > 4).
A more interesting experiment is to replace chloride ions with other counterions, for instance F− , Br− or I− . The binding energy should decrease with
increasing the ionic radius. Crude estimates in Table 1 were made assuming that
the binding energy ΔX of counterion X is inversely proportional to ionic radius.
This estimate ignores the contribution of water to binding energy and thus underestimates possible changes in recombination rates for diﬀerent counterions.
We used the same values for the electron transfer integral b, energy E2 of the
Sd+ state in the absence of a counterion (and, consequently, exponent β2 ) and
the phase volume factor Ω. The last column in Table 1 shows the recombination rate for the longest bridge of seven AT pairs. For the smallest ion F− , the
recombination time is as long as 3.33 s.
In order to substantiate our hypothesis about counterion attachment to the
Sd group and the ionic radius eﬀect on counterion binding energy, we performed
very preliminary calculations of binding energies for various halide anions with

the Sd+ group as shown in Table 1. Calculations were performed in a vacuum;
therefore, all energies are overestimated. Calculations in an aqueous solution are
currently in progress. The calculations were performed using density functional
theory and the B3LYP/3-21G basis set. It is obvious that energies diﬀer from
our expectations by a factor of 10 which is a consequence of the absence of
Coulomb interactions with water. However, the data trend has a reasonable
correlation with our expectation. Moreover, the modeled binding energy of F−
ion is greater than for Cl− as compared to our expectations for these ions which
leads us to expect that the charge recombination rate should be even slower than
we predicted compared to the present case of Cl− ions.
It may seem odd that the binding energy for Br− is slightly larger than that
for Cl− . This anomaly in the trend of decreasing binding energy of the system
with increasing ionic radius of the halide counterions can possibly be understood
when considering their electron aﬃnities. We see that the electron aﬃnity of the
chloride ion is larger than for the other halide ions. The partial charge in chloride,
approximately −0.405C, is twice as high than for other halides; therefore, it has
a minimum covalent bond strength which reduces the binding energy compared
to our expectations. A similar trend was reported in [20].

Conclusion

It is shown that the complicated double exponential recombination kinetics in
DNA hairpins can be interpreted assuming that this process is controlled by the
binding of a counterion. Key experiments are suggested to verify our theory and
to control the recombination process by varying counterions.
