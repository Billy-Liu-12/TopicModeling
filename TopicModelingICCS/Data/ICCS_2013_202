Abstract
In this paper, we utilise the newly developed method K-Disjoint Maximum Convex Sum Problem (K-DMCSP) in a real-life application, which
investigates the effects of land use changes on benthic stream communities in highland tropical streams of Nigeria. A collaboration between
computer scientists and freshwater biologists was established to implement and examine the robustness of this approach compared to a
traditional method that used rectangular shape in the K-Disjoint Maximum Sub-Array algorithm (K-DMSA). This novel approach uses the KDMCSP, which utilises a convex shape as compared to a rectangular shape. In the above comparison the new approach using the convex shape
optimises the sum and yields more accurate and precise results. This is because using the rectangular shape is limiting and is therefore not
flexible enough to cover various sets of data distributions. The new approach was applied to data that were collated from 55 tropical highland
streams on the Mambilla Plateau, Nigeria to investigate the interactions between substrate index or dissolved oxygen and temperature with
number of macroinvertebrates (taxa). The K-DMCSP method located the K-maximum threshold values. This was achieved by defining the
substrate index or dissolved oxygen associated most with the temperature by maximising the sum of elements of a selected portion of a two
dimensional array. The K-DMCSP successfully detected the various temperatures between the different categories of the substrate index or
dissolved oxygen, and how those variables affect numbers of macroinvertebrates. Furthermore, applying the algorithm revealed that the number
of macroinvertebrates differs according to land use (e.g. forestry and agriculture). The new method used in this paper is encouraging in its
capability to find the relationship between various environmental parameters and macroinvertebrate distribution and diversity. This method can
potentially be applied to other real-life applications requiring finding associations between different parameters.

1. Introduction
It is essential for studies to use analysis techniques and approaches that yield accurate outcomes, for example when
investigating relationships between different elements in ecology applications. This section will give background information on
this project. Other sections will cover the new approach, K-DMCSP, in more detail.
Habitat preference is widely viewed as a major process influencing the distribution and density of macroinvertebrates.
However, identifying and quantifying associated factors is not an easy task. Many hidden factors can be involved, and potential
causal factors might be indefinable, such as physicochemical parameters and land use. Studies of invertebrate interaction with
habitat and environmental factors have focused on traditional ecological approaches. A study in New Zealand investigated the
magnititude of effects of substrate particle size, and the influence of physical factors on benthic macroinvertebrates in 88 New
Zealand Rivers [1]. In a second study, substrate size preferences of macroinvertebrates were more clearly demonstrated by the
comparison of different substrates (e.g. boulders, cobbles) [2]. Although changes in light intensity were found to significantly
influence the periodicity of drifting organisms [2], less is known about other factors which may also affect the drift fauna of
slow-flowing waters [3]. The importance of current velocity and substrate type in determining the benthic distribution of
invertebrates is also well known [4-7].

The use of algorithm engineering has lots to offer the biological sciences. These algorithms contribute to the discovery of
knowledge by extracting new aspects of results and drawing new insights, in addition to those from general statistical methods.
This
detailed as follows. Despite the presence of
a large number of studies on macroinvertebrate communities relating substrate and other physical parameters with
macroinvertebrates elsewhere in the world, in Nigeria, apart from [8], data on macroinvertebrate colonization of natural
substrate in Nigerian streams are lacking. Conducting analysis with appropriately chosen approaches and techniques helps
decision making in policy development and management process for environmental studies. These approaches need to have
attributes of quality of performance, computation time, flexibility, and applicability to data of various natures. A specific
example is presented in this paper. Researchers in benthic ecology and other environmental gradients traditionally apply
statistical analysis to understand outcomes from their research data. An alternative approach for analysing data in ecology is
using advanced computer algorithms. Although the use of algorithmic computations is still in its infancy [9], there are emerging
and promising approaches using algorithms to analyse data sets. The rationales behind using the K-DMCSP method in this
in order to detect
the maximum events of interest. Secondly, two-dimensional observations can take many multiple dimensions. In this paper, we
set out to study the effects of two relationships: the first relationship was the correlation between substrate index and temperature

showed that using a convex shape in Maximum Sub-Array Problem (MSP) application resulted in finding accurate peak regions,
compared with the previous method that applied a rectangular shape. This gave precise data representation. Analysis revealed the
significance of substrate index or dissolved oxygen in association with the distribution and density of macroinvertebrates in
streams.
The following sections of this paper cover: Motivation for using the K-DMCSP; Review of the K-DMSA, implementing our
new approach K-DMCSP; Data collection and processing; Results and Discussion; and Conclusions.

In our study we used the K-Disjoint Maximum Convex Sum Problem (K-DMCSP) algorithm. A previous study proposed the
0]. The K-DMSA was utilized for the first time
K-Disjoint Maximum Sub-Array (K-DMSA) by extending
in Health Sciences by Fukuda and Takaoka to investigate air pollution and health effects [9]. They used the K-DMSA algorithm
to identify the association between [PM10] and admission counts patients over a wide range of age groups (each covering 5
years, from 0 to up to 98 years old). They investigated this by detecting rectangular regions (K-maximum subarrays) with
maximum admission counts, instead of determining a regression coefficient relating the variables [9]. Use of the K-DMSA
method was explored elsewhere [11]. In a given two- dimensional array, the K-DMSA algorithm finds disjoint sub-arrays that
maximize the sum. These sub-arrays are rectangular regions up to the Kth maxmium subarray, where K can be specified by the
user or the application. These regions have the most promising portions in the data set, which provide knowledge to represent
large data inputs. Although using the rectangular shape could lead to the promising regions, it fails to provide a flexible shape
that potentially could cover various data distributions. This motivated us to utilise the new method being proposed here using
the convex shape. The convex shape is a relatively complex shape when compared to the rectangular shape [12, 13]. The convex
shape requires three dimensions to determine the actual shape in a given matrix. Using the convex shape approach accurately
determines the peaks of data by optimising the sums. This study extends our earlier publications [12, 13, 14] with the addition of
a potential application for the K-DMCSP.
3. The algorithm
3.1 Review of the K-DMSA
Finding the maximum sub-array in a matrix that contains positive and negative numbers involves a complex dynamic
programming approach. Traditionally, maximum sub-arrays in a matrix are identified as rectangular regions that include
elements which return the largest possible sum. As an alternative to the rectangular shape for selecting the promising portion of
the matrix, the convex shape approach has been proposed [12-14]. This provides a maximised gain compared to that obtained
from the rectangular shape. Obtaining a solution from the rectangular shape requires less computational time because the
algorithm is less complicated. This is because it involves processing a regular rectangular region, whereas the convex region
involves complicated steps to implement an irregular shape. However, this irregularity allows for covering various data
distributions, hence maximising the potential for analysis of the outcomes from data.
K. The
Finding the K-DMSA approach includes finding the k-th maximum sub-array in the matrix, where k
maximum subarray in the matrix is S1. This algorithm has two cases: either the K maximum sub-arrays can be overlapped with
each other; or all maximum sub-arrays are disjointed. Disjointed sub-arrays show more practical importance as in most
applications.

This algorithm starts from the furthest left position position 1- and iterates though to the end of the array, column n.
Initially, a variable, S, which represents the solution is defined as negative infinity. This is updated every time when a higher
summation is found in the array. Variables c1 and c2 record the position of the sub-array. Variable t_sum is a temporary
summation that finds the potential maximum sub-array by summing the value of elements in the array from position d to position
e. In Figure 2, the process of finding the maximum sub-array in a two-dimensional array, B, with size m by n can be calculated

algorithm to cover the disjoint case by replacing all elements in the first located
maximum sub-array with negative infinity [10,15]; therefore, such a region will be voided in the calculation of finding the next
maximum sub-array. This process is iterated until the Kth maximum sub-array is found.
An example of finding the KK DMSA is demonstrated in Figure 3. When the largest maximum sum is found in the matrix, all
elements within the shape are replaced with negative infinity. The next potential maximum sum will then by-pass this area so all
maximum sub-arrays are not overlapped. This process is repeated until all K maximum sub-arrays are found.

3.2 Our approach, the KK DMCSP
The convex shape is defined as a shape that has a centre
a column is called an
anchor column [12,13]. Other research called the shape a rectilinear convex shape [16]. In this study we will use the concept of
the convex shape, which is not following the geometrical convex shape definition [12,14]. The convex shape combines two
with a top contour inclining or remaining
horizontal and a bottom contour declining or remaining flat from left to right [12], whereas the N Shape is a mirror image of the

scenarios:
The maximum gain for the first scenario is given by the best solution of its previous column, c-1. The gain for this shape is
the sum of the anchor column at column c from row r1 to row r2 in addition to the summation of the pervious solution at c-1 (the
lightly shaded area) - Figure 4.

The input matrix A contains real numbers that has n columns and m rows. This algorithm starts from the left most column,
column 1, and iterates through to the end of column n. Furthermore, the anchor column at c occupies from row r1 to row r2.
A variable grid is used as a temporary storage for the maximised sum (where the best solution is located at row r1 to r2
column c, expressed as [r1, r2, c]). Variables f1, f2, and f3 represent the result of the scenarios described above; f1 is the
summation of the anchor columns and its previous best solution; f2 is the sum of the element at row r1 and the best solution at
row r1 + 1 to r2; f3 is the sum of the element at row r2 and the best solution at row r1 to r2-1. The maximum result or best
solution out of these three cases is saved to the grid. This process is repeated until all columns have been processed. These results

4. Data collection and processing
The convex shape was implemented using trial data to test
attributes and to compare it with results from
rectangular shape [17-19]. Following this, we implemented the convex shape using real data obtained from a study that was
conducted in the tropical montane mountain region of the Mambilla Plateau, in the south-eastern corner of Taraba state, Nigeria
(11º- 6ºE and 6º- 7ºN). Streams sampled were near Yelwa village in the headwaters of the Donga River. The Plateau is at an
altitude
t
of approximately 1500 m above sea level. The Mambilla Plateau experiences two main seasons: The rainy and dry. The
duration of the rainy season is on average 250 days, from late March to the end of October. The dry season begins around
November and lasts until mid-March. The mean annual rainfall exceeds 1780 mm, peaking in June and July; however, due to the

Mohammed Thaher et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 909 – 918

elevation the daily mean temperature rarely exceeds 30ºC. During the sampling period (October 2009 to March 2010), the mean
air temperature was 24oC. The vegetation varied markedly across the 55 streams. In the tropical Montane rainforest, the riparian
vegetation was dominated by Deinbollia pinnata, Santiria trimera, Rafania, Croton macrostachyus, Anthonotha noldeae, and
Ficus 803. In the intensive grazing and pasture land, however, trees such as Acasia senegalensis, Polyscius fulva,
Beeilschmedia, Pouteria altissima, and Bridelia speciosa occured. In the Montane rainforest streams, substrates were mostly
found to be larger substrate sizes particularly boulders, cobbles, and sand, while in the intensively grazed pasture, and cropping
streams, substrates were dominated by sand or mud.
A total of 55 headwater streams (first and second order) were sampled. Streams were selected to provide at least five
replicates in nine different land uses. These land uses were: continuous tropical montane rainforest, forest fragment, intensive
grazing, open pasture cabbage and maize fields, tea and banana plantations, and eucalyptus forests. Each stream was sampled for
both physical and chemical parameters: Fine Particulate Organic Matter (FPOM); Coarse Particulate Organic Matter (CPOM);
algae; and benthic invertebrates. All sites were sampled on a single occasion during the tropical dry season between October
2009 and March 2010.
To compare the diversity, density, and composition of benthic invertebrate communities between the different land uses we
collected both qualitative and quantitative samples. At each site, five Surber samples (30 cm x 30 cm, 500collected from riffles. In order to get a more extensive species list, we also took a single composite kick-net sample (mesh 500-habitats in each stream. Additionally, leaf packs, wood jams, and moss were included in
this kick-net sample. Macroinvertebrates collected include mayfly (Leptophlebiidae), Stonefly (Perlidae) and Caddisflies
(Hydropsychidae) (Figure. 8). These species are pollution sensitive and are used as bio-indicators of environmental degradation.

oven dried and ashed at 450oC for 3 hrs to calculate AFDM.
All benthic invertebrates were preserved in the field in 70% ethanol and returned to the laboratory for analyses. In the

taxonomy of Nigerian aquatic invertebrates is poorly known therefore we used a combination of keys by [17-20].
At each site, a representative reaches at least 10 m long containing a riffle/run/pool complex was selected. Furthermore,
physico-chemical factors were measured in situ including temperature, pH, conductivity (using a 4-star Orion pH/conductivity
portable meter), and dissolved oxygen (using WTW oxygen meter). Filtered water samples were also collected. These were
returned to the laboratory and analysed for Nitrate and phosphate using the Molybdenum blue calorimetric method (R.J. Hill
laboratories Ltd, Hamilton New Zealand).
In the field, substrate size and composition, wetted width, depth, and current velocity were measured. Channel stability was
also evaluated at each site using the method of Pfankuch [21]. The impacts of two relationships were examined: the first was
investigating the relationship between substrate index and temperature and their influence at the macroinver
preference in steams. The second was the relationship between dissolved oxygen and temperature and their influence at the
Using the new method (K-DMCSP) in this research, we were able to capture
the peaks of data which gave more precise regions of biological significance, compared with results from previous research using
rectangular regions [9,11].
5. Results and Discussion
The collated data in this study were gathered by one of the originators of this research, a member of the Freshwater Ecology
Research Group, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. He investigated the effects of land use changes on benthic stream
communities in highland tropical streams on Mambilla Plateau north-east Nigeria using the new method, K-DMCSP. This
investigation was achieved by establishing collaboration with the Algorithm Engineering and Formal Methods Research Group
(AEFMRG). We implemented new approaches to finding optimal association results between the research parameters. We also
compared these results to previous outcomes from approaches using the rectangular shape to find maximum sums of the
subarrays [14, 16].

Two algorithms, Algorithm (2) and Algorithm (5), were implemented to compare results obtained from using the rectangular
shape with that of the convex shape we used the disjoint case in finding maximum convex sum regions. The time complexity of
both algorithms is O(Kn
( 3). Using the convex shape provided precise regions that increased the maximum sums using the same
solution for the K maximum sums by using the convex shape in the disjoint case to optimise the sums. In figure

Fig.9. matrix (1) includes the normalised data that was collated from the Mambilla Plateau, Nigeria, while considering three variables: subtract index,
temperature, and numbers of macroinvertebrates (Taxa).

At the beginning, the original matrix (M)
M was normalised by subtracting the anchor value (w= 28) using equation (1). The
normalised data were stored in matrix (1) (Figure 9). We ran Algorithms (2) and (5) on matrix (1). The first three peaks from
the data showed the same regions; this means that the convex shape encompasses the rectangular shape and represents a
generalised solution to the MSP [12]. The two different algorithms met in the Venn diagram; this was illustrated in a previous
publication [12]. In this research both algorithms gave the same gain for the first three maximum sums.
In this study we found that macroinvertebrates had a preference for large substrate size. This result was further clarified by
applying the KK DMCSP algorithm. Three major peak areas were captured by the two Algorithms (2 and 5), these peaks were
based on the interactions between temperature, substrate index and macroinvertebrate taxa (Figure 9). The three peaks were:
firstly, medium to high temperature range in habitats with large substrate size (e.g. boulders) supported the highest density of
macroinvertebrate taxa with 78 individuals. This region was the first maximum convex sum (S1 = 117). Secondly, medium
temperature in habitats with moderate substrate type (e.g. cobbles) was the next favourable with 54 individuals. This region was
the second maximum convex sum (S
S2 = 54). Thirdly, at a very high temperature and low substrate index (e.g. mud and sand), the
lowest macroinvertebrate taxa density was recorded with 3 individuals. This region was the third maximum convex sum (S
S3 =
37).

Fig.10. matrix (2) includes the normalised data that were collated from the Mambilla Plateau, Nigeria, while considering three variables: Dissolved oxygen
percentage, temperature, and number of macroinvertebrate taxa. It also shows the first maximum sum by running the algorithms (2 and 5). The convex shape is
more flexible to cover various data distributions.

Results from our research also showed that the interaction of macroinvertebrates with temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO)
was better analysed using the KK DMCSP algorithm - matrix (2) and figure (10). Matrix (2) represents the interactions between
temperature, dissolved oxygen percentage and macroinvertebrate taxa. The anchor value (w=7) was used in figures 10 and 11. In
these figures, in the first peak region (S1 = 358) captured by Algorithm (5), we identified three important informative areas.
These were: firstly, at medium and high temperature range in habitats having DO% between 40 - <43% to 73 - <76% recorded
to favour highest taxa richness (319 individuals); secondly, high temperatures to extremely high temperature range in habitats
with DO% 61- <64 was next in taxa richness with 30 individuals; and thirdly, at very low temperature in habitats having DO%
67- <70 the lowest taxa richness of 16 individuals was recorded. The convex shape robustly identified those areas.
Similarly, Quinn et al. [1] studied the magnitude of effects of substrate particle size on benthic invertebrates in 88 New
Zealand Rivers, and found that the distribution of common taxa in the Mohaka River indicated significant substrate preference,
where taxonomic richness and total densities of microinvertebrate were least in patches of sand and small gravel. Also Jowett and
Richardson [22] investigated microhabitat preferences of benthic invertebrates in Waingawa River, New Zealand. This study
reported that mayflies, stoneflies, cased caddisflies, and Diptera showed preference for a substrate index of more than 6
(boulder/cobbles) and beetles preference for a substrate index of about 5.6 (gravel/cobble) habitat, while the Operational
Taxonomic Unites (OTUs) spread to occupy the full range of particulate substrate. The pollution sensitive taxa (Mayflies larvae,
stoneflies larvae and caddisflies larvae) were mostly associated with habitats having big substrates.
Our choice of Algorithms supports a more efficient way of capturing all data sets at once when compared to using other
methods, such as the third maximum convex sum (S
S3 = 12). At least an extra two steps are required to achieve the same result by
using algorithm (2); this algorithm uses the rectangular shape in the analysis Matrix (2) and ffigure (11).

6. Conclusions
Previous research has employed the KK DMSP algorithm in many applications. All these studies focused on using a
rectangular shape to find the maximum sum in MSP. Recently, MSP took new turn by using the concept of the maximum convex
sums. The maximum convex sums have many attributes that increase the utility of MSP in applications. In this paper, we
showed that obtaining optimised gain improved when using the convex shape instead of the rectangular shape, whilst having the
same time complexity for both algorithms. The convex shape is a more flexible, irregular shape that covers various data
distributions, leading to maximised gain. This research applied the KK DMCSP algorithm to an application in ecology, where it

demonstrated computing precise results compared to outcomes obtained from applying the rectangular shape. The K-DMCSP
successfully detected various temperatures between different categories of the substrate index or dissolved oxygen, and how
those variables affected numbers of macroinvertebrates. In this study we found that macroinvertebrates had a preference for large
substrate size. The pollution sensitive taxa (Mayflies larvae, stoneflies larvae and caddisflies larvae) were most closely associated
with habitats having a large substrate index. An experimental investigation using the K-DMCSP algorithm, by changing the
weight parameter successfully provided specific and detailed results by maximising the gain to find the peaks of the data. The KDMCSP algorithm used was shown to be comprehensive in its application. This algorithm not only found the same three peaks
located by the rectangular shape algorithm (Figure 9), but also went even further in locating precise areas within the data
Figures 10 and 11.
Overall, this study provided a new approach to potentially apply MSP applications. This approach ensures optimised results
compared to previous research approaches. Future work could involve improving the time complexity for the K-DMCSP
algorithm.
