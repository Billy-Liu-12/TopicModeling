processes performed by these systems within any given single level of abstraction may require the
accurate representation and study of several spatial and temporal scales. This is particularly true for
historical and geographic phenomena (Heppenstall et al., 2011). The colonisation of Senegal (West
Africa) by the black rat is a typical example. The black rat is a commensal species known to
disseminate using human transportation (Aplin et al., 2011). In this context, a simple model would
represent the loading of rats onto commercial vehicles, followed by their transportation and unloading
from those vehicles. Even within this parsimonious scheme, geographers and biologists discriminate,
focus on, study and consider interactions between events occurring at different scales. For scientists
studying this topic, the colonisation processes may include the dissemination of the species (i) over the
whole country, over the scale of a century, by means of national transport routes (Lombard and Ninot,
2002), (ii) within regional districts, in which small roads and tracks form a dense network allowing the
spread of this species to small sites over the scale of a decade (Lucaccioni et al., 2016), (iii) at the city
or town scale, with rats able to spread on their own across the streetscape over the scale of a day. In
such cases, multi-scale modelling can provide new insight into the functioning of such systems
(Pumain, 2006).
Geographic modelling approaches are generally restricted to a certain spatial and temporal scale,
characterised by an extension and a granularity (Langlois, 2009). In this work ‘multiscale’ refers to
this possible navigation between several formalised spatial and temporal scales (e.g., Evans, 2012).
We present a generic model that can account for the various scales simultaneously, together with the
relationships between them. In our approach, a ‘world’ corresponds to a complete and autonomous
submodel with its own fixed spatiotemporal scale, places, objects and agents. The formalised worlds
can be nested: a world can represent a part of another world in greater detail, facilitating more precise
studies of its phenomena. This process of moving between scales should be repeatable from one scale
to another ad infinitum.
We first present the model selected to describe each autonomous world and the adaptation selected
to tackle the multi-world multi-scale question. In this study, in addition to the design of agents and
objects, we focus mostly on description of the spatial and temporal formalisms chosen to describe
‘worlds’ and the ‘multi-world’ system. We then present an application of this model to the particular
case of the spread of black rats over historical time in Senegal. We then discuss this multi-scale
approach in the context of previous works.

2 Presentation of the model
2.1 Spatial scale
Geographic space (the environment)
consists of a Cartesian co-ordinate system
determined by a metric and an extension.
In our approach, space is formalised, in
each autonomous world, as a combination
of a continuous space conforming to its
referential and a grid of given granularity
where the cell size represents the spatial
scale (Gibson et al., 2000; Vo et al.,
2012). This granularity grid is set by the
scientists studying the system, according
to their perception of the phenomena
studied at this scale. The discrete space
provided by the grid makes it possible to

Figure 1: Architecture of the multi-scale spatial model.
Each agent is referenced in the continuous space and in the
grid of the world in which it stands. All grids belong to the
same plane, that of the continuous space.

enrich the landscape with information from other sources and to identify higher-level structures (i.e.,
patch of contiguous cells with the same characteristics). The combination of these different topologies
makes it possible to locate precisely the neighbourhoods of points, objects and agents of the
environment.
Within the multi-world model, the continuous space remains the ‘universal’ reference, and several
grids of different granularities and extensions, each defining their own world, are embedded within
this space. Each grid, representing the environment for a world, constitutes a discretisation of a
geographic map representing part of the global domain to be studied (Figure 1).

2.2 Changing spatial scale
To take into account possible changes in
spatial scale, agents must perceive their
environment in a constant radius of perception
(R), rather than in a single constant-order (N)
Moore (or von Neumann) neighbourhood
(Braga et al., 2016). Thus, when changing
spatial scale, the N value for the agents can be
recalculated using N = R / Cell Size (Figure 2).

2.3 Time scale

Figure 2: The number of cells that an agent can
perceive depends on the size of the cells, when the
perception radius of the agent is constant.

The
multi-agent
model is a discrete
timestep
simulator
controlled
by
a
scheduler. For multiagent modelling with
discrete time scheduling,
time scale is usually
represented as the unique
execution frequency of
agents, and a multiple
time scale model is the
possibility to represent

agents in any one world
can perform unitary actions programmed for a duration that may differ between agents (Guo and Tay,
2008). We define that duration, for each type of agent, as the ‘Activity Unit Duration’ (AUD). The
time scale or granularity of a particular world is given by its own simulation step, referred to here as
the ‘World Tick Duration’ (WTD).
The world’s scheduler triggers the execution of the agents belonging to that world (Figure 3a),
according to frequencies (Fi ) calculated, for each type of agent, and updated, when WTD changes, as
follows:
If WTD > AUD then Fi = WTD/AUD. In this case, agents execute their activity Fi times each WTD.
If WTD < AUD then Fi = AUD/WTD. In this case, agents execute their activity once every Fi WTDs.
Within a multi-world context, multiple time scales are managed by a higher-level scheduler known
as the ‘global scheduler’ (Figure 3b). This scheduler has an overall time step characterised by a ‘global
tick duration’ (GTD), which is the absolute time scale or reference scale.

	

Pape Adama Mboup et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 968–977

Just as single-world schedulers trigger their agents’ activities according to Fi, so the global
scheduler successively activates the worlds it manages according to their own frequencies (Fj). Fj is
calculated and updated, when a WTD or GTD changes, as follows:
If GTD > WTD, then Fj = GTD / WTD. In this case, single worlds are activated Fj times each GTD.
If GTD < WTD, then Fj = WTD / GTD. In this case, single worlds are activated once every Fj GTDs.
The frequencies Fi and Fj may not always be integers, and can therefore take a value of 1.33, for
example. However, since time is discretised, agents or worlds therefore cannot be activated 1.33 times
each tick, or 1 time each 1.33 ticks. This problem has been overcome by multiplying Fi or Fj by a
convenient (e.g., determined by scientists working in the field) order of magnitude. In the example
given, a factor of 10 would result in agents or worlds being activated 13 times every 10 ticks or 10
times every 13 ticks.

2.4 Inter-world communication via ‘gates’
Agents
may
sometimes have to travel
to other worlds to reach
specific places. This
would be the case, for
example,
for

networks (Mboup et al.,
2015)
We
have
facilitated the switch
from one world to
another in our model, by
introducing the notion of
‘gates’ as compulsory
crossing points common
to several worlds (Figure
4).
Figure 4: Use of crossing points between worlds. World 1 contains an area

carriers using the graph
to move, the agent makes use of its ‘knowledge’ about the simulated worlds to build a graph covering
several worlds to reach its destination. In this example, we assume an agent has to go from point W1,1
in world 1 to point W3,2 in world 3. The agent will travel along the shortest path, using the following
steps, to reach its destination: it builds a “path of worlds” indicating the path to follow, {W2, W3}. The
agent in W1 must go to W2 and then to W3 before it can reach the point W3,2. It must thus successively
cross two worlds {W2, W3}. For each world in this path (e.g. W2), it selects the most suitable gate to
reach the world concerned (gate W1,2), finds the correct (shortest) path between its current position and
this gate, W1,1 and W1,2, giving {W1,1 ... W1,2}. At the gate (W1,2), the agent leaves its current world
and enters the other world (world 2), reaching the arrival cell (W2,1) connected to the gate.
When an agent changes world, it sheds its set of references as well as those of the other agents and
objects it contains. It thereafter adopts the references of the new worlds and let its embarked agents
and objects do the same. For agents with time-dependent units of activity, speed must therefore be

971

Pape Adama Mboup et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 968–977

972	

recalculated relative to the tick duration of the new world. The agent then adapts to the new spatial
scale. For example, it retrieves, from the arrival cell, the type of graph that it can use. It goes through
the whole process again when it moves on to the next world (W3). If the world path is exhausted, that
is, when the agent arrives in the world (W3) containing its final destination (W3,2), it develops and
travels along the most appropriate (shortest) path between its current position (W3,1) and its final
destination (W3,2).

2.5 Perception of multiple worlds by agents
As the worlds intersect spatially and agents can move between worlds, an agent in a given place in
a given world must be able to perceive the objects and agents around it, regardless of the world to
which they belong. In our implementation, this is achieved with the Moore neighborhood restricted to
the perception disc of the agent, which is calculated precisely using the continuous space (Figure 2).
Each time a new world is added to the model, and for each cell defining a place common to several
worlds, the list of corresponding cells in the other worlds is updated. This method is somewhat
cumbersome, but it makes it possible to define an extended Moore neighbourhood that can be
intersected with the perception disc of the agent.

A single landscape. A landscape is a global container referencing all visible objets. It is
composed of three types of projections: a continuous space supporting the co-ordinate system
and metrics; a set of graphs of different types used to move agents according to their type
(trucks on roads, trains on rail, boats on rivers) and a raster for discretising the same space into
contiguous square cells. Each cell is used to describe the ‘soil’ attributes (field, road, house,
etc.). Patches of contiguous cells of the same type are identified as land plots. This class allows
the delimitation and identification of different areas of the environment (cities, trade area, etc.).
Agents of different types immersed within the continuous space and belonging to the cells of
the raster. Agents execute patterns of behaviour according to a classical perceptiondeliberation-decision-execution process adapted from (Ferber, 1999).
Each world can be simulated as a standalone model. In a multi-world context, different worlds
are managed by an object of the GlobalScheduler class. This object has its own list of worlds
created from the world class, manages the different time scales and triggers its worlds
according to their time scales (see Figure 3).

3 Case study
The model was
applied
in
an
operational context
in
collaboration
with biology and
geography experts.
It was used to
investigate
the
process of black rat
dispersal
throughout Senegal
by
means
of
commercial
transportation.
Black rats were first
reported in Senegal
in the city of SaintLouis
and Figure 6: Localization and spatial extension of the three levels of abstraction (worlds)

settlements in the
19th century (Konečnỳ et al. 2013). They then made use of commercial transport activities to spread to
the interior of the country, beginning with the northern waterways of Senegal. This species then
progressively colonised the groundnut trade basin by means of the railway, which was being extended
eastward from the coast. Most commercial transport is by road nowadays, and there has been an
eastward extension of tarmac roads towards the region of Tambacounda and Kédougou.
The objective defined by the scientists working on this project was to set up a simulator to make it
possible to represent and study the history of black rat dispersal in Senegal at the scales they were
conducting their research and including changes (development of the groundnut trade basin,
emergence of new cities, new transport routes, etc.) considered of importance for the processes
studied. Three different spatial and temporal scales were thus designed and linked (Figure 6).
The ‘centennial’ scale (world 1) considers processes over the course of a century, with a daily step
for the whole national territory digitised into square cells of 7.5 x 7.5 km; The ‘decennial’ scale (world

2) was a magnification providing a more thorough study of the regions of Tambacounda and
Kédougou digitised into square cells of 2 x 2 km and simulated over 10 years (beginning in 1990),
with an hourly step. The third scale focused on the city of Kédougou. This ‘urban’ scale (world 3)
bore a raster representing the streets and districts of the city, with square cells of 38 x 38 m and oneminute time steps. A single level of the process was considered at all three scales: the loading of black
rats onto commercial vehicles, their transportation and release from these vehicles. We first extended
the model by adding the classes framed in red on Figure 7.
We considered black rats and the humans
transporting them (referred to here as
‘carriers’) as the two types of agent in this
model. The carrier agents can travel to a list
of destinations that may be regions, cities, or
districts, and have the use of one vehicle, of
the truck, train or boat type. Each type of
vehicle has its own speed and can travel
along a particular type of thoroughfare (road,
rail or river), corresponding to an instance of
both the Graph and LandPlot classes. In this
Figure 7: Extended model from Figure 5 adapted for the

surroundings according to a given perception
disc. They try to load with a given probability if a vehicle is located within their surroundings. Black
rats are also biological entities; they grow in a succession of maturation stages, and they tentatively
mate with their own relatives when they come across them. At a given time step and for a given world,
the carriers select a destination and move towards it, whilst the black rats consider their surroundings
and either try to board the vehicles or interact with other rats to reproduce.
The simulated space for each world was documented using the grid cells, each filled with
information concerning the suitability of the environment for rats (bioclimates), the types of terrain
(road, rail, river, city, etc.), the local population or the occurrence of particular items (gold mines,
warehouses, etc.). Objects of the LandPlot class were used to delimit and identify the various different
areas making up the environment (fields, trade areas, tracks, etc.). The graphs connect the landplots of
a given type and establish transport routes. Gates were also included, for travel between worlds.
Each world was first designed and documented on its own, with different data sources for different
worlds. This standalone approach was the principal mode of use of the model by scientists, and its
outputs were discussed in detail.

4 Results
Using the model, we were able to represent the three scales, each with its own environment, scale
and display, simultaneously (Figure 8). The yellow circles on Figure 8 represent the gates between
worlds. The red trucks can travel between worlds via these gates, whereas the blue trucks, boats and
trains are restricted to a single world. Vehicles can cross the areas represented in the other worlds
without entering these other worlds. For example, the train travelling between Dakar and Kayes (light
grey line) does not need to enter world 2.
Despite their representation on separate displays, the worlds are hence spatially and temporally
nested and are located in the corresponding positions in the continuous space. It is possible to zoom
in/zoom out of each display, and to superimpose displays, to improve observation of the passage
between worlds.
The example on Figure 9 illustrates the differences obtained between a mono-scale model
(centennial) and a cascading two scales (centennial/decenal) model. In this example, only black rat

5 Discussion
The approach used made it possible to simulate a cascading set of worlds of increasing
spatiotemporal resolution for the exploration of phenomena occurring over several historical and
geographic scales, in the case of the spread of black rats in Senegal. Comparison of simulations from a
mono-scale world and a two-scale world shows an agreement between the order of magnitude of the
transport dynamics of black rats obtained in both situations. However, in a multi-scale context,
calibration and sensitivity analyses of the mono-scale models to parameters have to be called into
question and should be reworked in light of the new offered perspectives.
Alternative approaches could be used to address the various questions tackled in this model.
Another suitable approach for the nesting of the worlds would have been the recursive agent method
(Vo et al., 2012), in which an agent can itself be a complete model, with an environment, a scheduler

and other agents. Several other methods have also been proposed for the passage between worlds,
including ‘capture/release’ (ibid), ‘emergence/group creation’ (Servat et al., 1998) or
‘aggregation/disaggregation’ (Soyez et al., 2012), a method allowing individuals from one level to
aggregate or disintegrate to another level (dynamic change of level).
However, these methods were developed principally for multi-level modelling of complex systems
embedded within constitutive (i.e., successively emergent) hierarchies, whereas the proposed model
was designed in a context of multi-scale modelling. Therefore, it seemed most appropriate to break the
problem down into two steps: (i) make use of a classical agent-based submodel (world), in which each
world is scale-specific and self-sufficient, an approach considered convenient for the scientists from
different disciplines working on the problem at particular scales and (ii) include supplementary
mechanisms to manage the interaction between worlds, such as passages between worlds via a ‘gate’
concept, and the perception of the multiple worlds by the agents. This decoupling makes it possible to
reproduce agent management at world level (see Figure 3), such that any number of worlds can be
integrated.
For multiple time scale modelling, we could have made use of the discrete event scheduling
approach (Guo and Tay, 2008). This approach facilitates the non-uniform scheduling of the execution
of agent activities when these activities occur over a diverse range of time scales. Our approach, based
on discrete time scheduling, was chosen because it was considered more practical, as it is widely used
in available simulation platforms, such as NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999), GAMA (Taillandier et al.,
2012) or Repast (North et al., 2013) We completed this formalism with the appropriate algorithm,
facilitating the integrated execution of worlds with different time scales, and of processing agents with
different activity unit durations.

6 Conclusion
The proposed approach provides the necessary and sufficient mechanisms for simulating agents’
moves between worlds defined at different spatial and temporal scales and, theoretically, without any
formal limitation of the number of space-time scales. The cascade simulations that result from this
approach lead to dynamics that are comparable to those of equivalent worlds considered at a single
spatial and temporal scale. Building a model on these bases may provide geographers, biologists, etc. a
useful tool for better identifying the most relevant scales, or combinations of scales, needed to
understand deemed patterns of interest for their research questions.
