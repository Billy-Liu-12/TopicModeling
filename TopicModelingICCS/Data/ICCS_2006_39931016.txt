Abstract. Properties of traﬃc noise and ﬂow are often measured on
complex networks and are used to diagnose the network’s functional state
and underlying structure, even though the precise structure–function interdependences are often unknown. Here we attempt to unravel some
basic interdependences between structure and traﬃc on networks in numerically controlled traﬃc models. We simulate constant-density traﬃc
on two diﬀerent network topologies, which emerge from the same preferential rewiring rules but one within growth and the other under static
conditions. We determine universal noise properties and the maximalﬂow spanning trees on these classes of network topologies. We study
both low-density traﬃc (structure dependences) and high-density trafﬁc, where queuing inﬂuences transport properties.

Introduction

Dependences of network topology and optimal network functioning are gaining
increased attention in network research lately [1, 2, 3]. While networks driving
e.g. biological processes have adapted and optimized their structures through
evolutionary mechanisms, whose details are largely unknown [4], artiﬁcial networks, on the other hand, often suﬀer from all kinds of dis-functional problems
and weaknesses. Both theoretical and practical aspects of the structure–function
interdependences are of interest.
In real networks, measurements of dynamic variables, such as ﬂow through
individual links, ﬂuctuations of noise at individual nodes, round-trip times of
information packets, high-throughput measurements etc., are often used to diagnose the network’s functional state and structure. The idea is that the temporal
ﬂuctuations of the local node and link activities in an intricate way reﬂect the
underlying network structure and potential dynamic correlations. The nature
of these interdependences, however, is often hidden in the non-linearity of the
dynamics and in most cases not known. In the absence of precise theoretical
grounds, often largely simpliﬁed formal procedures are applied for these purposes, often severely missing crucial aspects of the studied systems. It is therefore
of great importance to identify the essential elements of the structure—function
interdependences in complex networks in a systematic manner. One approach is

to use numerical models of network dynamics in which a controlled variation of
both structural parameters and the dynamic rules can be done systematically
and inter-correlations can be detected and quantiﬁed. Moreover, robustness can
be checked against varied dynamic conditions.
Here we apply an approach of this kind to study information transport on
networks within a numerical model with driving, search, and queuing which we
introduced in Refs. [5, 6, 7]. We use two classes of networks which are grown from
the same preferential rewiring rules and same control parameters, but with diﬀerent conditions that are known as evolving and static networks. By implementing
the traﬃc rules on these networks, we show how they perform the information transport within the same dynamical conditions of a stationary traﬃc ﬂow.
Within the model we measure the travel times of packets, ﬂow at all links on
the network and temporal ﬂuctuations of all node activities. In the low-density
limit of our dynamics when packet density ρ → 1, representing the inﬁnitely
slow driving (or sequential packet dynamics), these measures incorporate most
of the network structural eﬀects on the transport. In the high density limit we
measure waiting times of packets at individual nodes and global noise correlations, which give quantitative estimates of the queuing eﬀects on networks. In
the low-density limit we present quantitative results for the ﬂow intensity along
network links, which deﬁnes the maximum-ﬂow spanning tree of the network,
as well as noise correlations and queue distributions, when the packet density
is kept high. We show how the observed properties of traﬃc are related to the
structural characteristics of both types of networks.

2.1

Structures and Traﬃc Rules
Network Structures

We consider two types of networks grown from preferential attachment [8] and
rewiring rules [9], in which we apply diﬀerent constraints known as evolving and
static conditions. (i) In the evolving case, the network is grown by sequentially
added nodes from i = 1, 2, · · · N , with the preferential attachment and preferential rewiring rules according to the time dependent probabilities pin and pout .
They are applied in the subset of pre-existing nodes at each growth step i. The
linking probabilities depend on the current number of incoming qin and outgoing
qout links at a node [9]
pin (k, i) =

α + qin (k, i)/M
(1 + α)i

pout (n, i) =

α + qout (n, i)/M
(1 + α)i

.

(1)

These rules lead to power-law distributions of both incoming and outgoing links
[9], a large clustering coeﬃcient and link correlations [10], a structure which is
statistically very similar to the actual WWW. This is why this network is called
Web graph (WG). An example of the emergent structure is shown in the left
column of Fig. 1. (ii) For the static graph we apply the same rules as in Eq. (1),
however, the links are added sequentially for the ﬁxed number of nodes i = N .

Multiple linking between the same pair of nodes is not allowed. The emergent
structure of the static network (SN) where L = N = 1000 links is also shown in
Fig. 1 (right).
A detailed quantitative analysis of the structure reveals that both incoming
and outgoing links behave statistically the same and obey a stretched-exponential
distribution. In addition, the clustering in this graph is small compared to the
Web graph and link correlations are entirely absent. In Fig. 2 we show the degree
distributions for the two graphs.

Implementation of Constant-Density Traﬃc

The traﬃc of information packets on a network is implemented as a guided
random walk between speciﬁed pairs of nodes on the graph [5, 7, 10]—the origin
and destination (delivery address) of a packet. The created packets are navigated

through the graph using the local nnn-search rule [5, 10], where two depth levels
around each node (sometimes called information horizon 2) are searched for the
packet destination address. The rule is supplemented by random diﬀusion when
the search is unsuccessful. The packets are removed when they arrive at their
destinations. Here we implement the traﬃc for a ﬁxed number of moving packets.
We start with a given number ρ of packets. The arrived and removed packets are
replaced in the next time step by creating the same number of new packets at
randomly chosen nodes. In the limit ρ = 1, this corresponds to the sequential
random walk problem. At density ρ > 1 packets interact by forming queues at
nodes along their paths. We assume ﬁnite maximum queue lengths of H = 1000,
and a LIFO (last-in-ﬁrst-out) queuing rule. The length of an actual queue at
node i we denote by hi (t). Networks are given by their adjacency matrix. When
the graphs are disconnected, as it is the case with both WG and SN, we consider
the transport only within their giant clusters.

Low-Density Traﬃc: Limit ρ = 1

The limit of inﬁnitely slow driving ρ → 1 is easily realized: as one packet arrives
at its destination, another one is created somewhere else in the network. Therefore, packet interaction is absent and the properties of traﬃc entirely depend on
network topology.

1020

B. Tadi´c and S. Thurner

By running a large number of packets we record the number of walks along
each link (dynamic ﬂow) and through each node (dynamic noise) in the network.
Obviously, the inequality of nodes with respect to their local network environment makes the ﬂow and noise ﬂuctuate throughout the network and makes it
diﬀer among diﬀerent network structures. One approach toward a quantitative
analysis of these ﬂuctuations is to construct a maximum-ﬂow spanning tree, on
which each node is connected to the rest of network nodes via its maximum-ﬂow
link. Implementing a greedy algorithm, we determine the trees respective to the
ﬂow at ρ = 1 limit on the two networks. The trees are shown in Fig. 1 (bottom).
The structure of these trees reﬂects both the underlying network geometry
and how that geometry eﬀects transport with given navigation rules–local nnnsearch. In the case of the WG the tree exhibits a scale-free topology, suggesting
a certain degree of compatibility of the traﬃc and structure. Similarly, for the
SN the tree shows some inhomogeneity that resembles the one on the underlying
graph.

the SN for ρ = 1, and nnn-traﬃc

The max-ﬂow spanning trees represent the union of maximum-ﬂow paths on
the underlying network structure. In Fig. 3 we show distributions of lengths of all
such paths on the two trees that are shown in Fig. 1. Once again, diﬀerences in
the graph topologies and thus in their maximum traﬃc trees manifest themselves
in the statistics of the maximum-ﬂow paths. The average distance along such
paths on the WG and SN diﬀers by a factor of about 5, the maximum distance
by about a factor of 3.

Noise Properties for High-Density Traﬃc

For large packet density ρ >> 1 motion of a packet may be aﬀected by other
packets moving through the same node. Queues of packets then occur and a

Traﬃc Noise and Maximum-Flow Spanning Trees

priority rule sets the order of processing (LIFO as a particular case). Apart
from the traﬃc density, the node surrounding on the network determines the
length of the queue at that node. In particular, on inhomogeneous networks,
hubs appear to receive more packets compared to other nodes, due to their
large connectivity. Since in the algorithm one packet is processed per time step,
other packets remain in the queue to be processed later (when no new packet is
received). The distribution of queue lengths is therefore reﬂecting the network
structure in a particular way. A snapshot of queue-lengths h, for traﬃc density
ρ = 100 in the two network structures WG and SN leads to the distributions
shown in Fig. 4.

queue length h
Fig. 4. Distributions of queue-lengths in the WG and the SN for a density ρ = 100

In the homogeneous SN most of the nodes are processing a similar numbers
of packets, which leads to a ﬂat distribution of queues and a cut-oﬀ indicating
that queues larger than h = 40 are occurring rarely. On the other hand, a large
queue of h = 80 − 90, packets can be found on the hubs on the inhomogeneous
WG with high probability. On the rest of the nodes the queues are distributed
with a power-law distribution, apart from very small queues at periphery nodes.
The queuing times of packets extend their travel times, thus reducing the overall
traﬃc eﬃciency [7]. Note, that in the current implementation, with a constant
number of moving packets, jamming can not occur as long as the traﬃc density
ρ < H, where H is the maximum allowed queue length. However, the travel
times of packets can be very long (given by a power-law distribution) [5].
The observed queue lengths are compatible with the the temporal properties
of node activity on the two networks, shown in Fig. 5. While queues at important nodes in the inhomogeneous WG are long, the number of nodes that
are simultaneously active is small, ﬂuctuating about an average value n ≈ 8.

nnn-search

Compared to the more homogeneous SN for the same traﬃc density, on average
n ≈ 80 nodes are processing a packet simultaneously, leading to short queues at
all nodes. Further quantitative analysis of the time series reveals the diﬀerences
in the packet processing of the two classes on networks. In particular, long-range
correlations (anti-persistence) in the number of active nodes develops on both
networks. However, in the conditions of constant packet density the ﬂuctuations
on the SN appear to be more correlated compared to the WG. The power spectrum exhibiting a power-law behavior S(f ) ∼ f −φ for f above some threshold
value, are given in Fig. 5 (top panel), with φ = 1.1 for SN and φ = 1.4 for the
WG. Therefore, an increased traﬃc density leads to stronger correlations among
node activity on the more homogeneous SN. Diﬀerences are also observed in the
noise ﬂuctuation properties on these networks, which will be reported elsewhere.

Conclusions

We have implemented a constant-density information-packet traﬃc on two
classes of network topologies: correlated, strongly clustered scale-free WG and
a more homogeneous, weakly clustered uncorrelated SN. We have shown that
for diﬀerent driving conditions and the nnn-search strategy the WG tends to
form large queues at its hub nodes, whereas, the more homogeneous SN distributes traﬃc over a large number of nodes, whose activity appears to be

strongly correlated in time. Therefore despite of generally larger distances as
illustrated e.g. with the maximum-ﬂow spanning tree, the homogeneous network
performs well at high traﬃc density.
