Abstract. A micromechanics-based constitutive damage model with
clear physical grounds and few parameters is presented, in which the
Ponte-Castaneda and Willis estimate (PCW estimate) is adopted and
applied to solid matrix weaken by penny-shaped microcracks. The basic
idea is to integrate the homogenization procedure into the standard thermodynamics framework. An energy release rate-based damage criterion
is proposed in which the interaction eﬀects between diﬀerent cracks families are involved. The proposed constitutive model is then extended to
an orientation-based nonlocal version. Finally, this model has been implemented into a ﬁnite element code and the numerical results obtained
for 2D problems show its predictive capacity and mesh independent characteristics.
Keywords: Homogenization, damage, crack interaction, nonlocal.

Introduction

Nonlinear behavioral characteristics in brittle materials such as concrete and
some rocks are commonly considered as the consequence of the nucleation and
growth of microcracks [1] [2]. The modelling of the behaviors due to microcracking processes in brittle materials is a topic of great concern in many ﬁelds of civil
engineering. Various material models have been developed, among which continuum damage mechanics based on the thermodynamics irreversible processes is
widely used for investigation of materiral deteriorating phenomena by using one
or several internal state-dependent variables [3] [4] [5]. In spite of the eﬃciency of
model implementations and the advantages in application to engineering analysis, some of the concepts and parameters involved in these models are not clearly
related to physical mechanisms [6].
For two decades, several micromechanical models have been developed for
concrete and rocks [7] [8] [9], which provide a promising tool for more physically
based descriptions of damage induced anisotropy and of material degradation.
However, these models are often limited to dilute distribution of microcracks
without consideration of interactions between microcracks. Further, most of

these models are not based on a rigorous upscaling method to deﬁne macroscopic
properties of homogenized material. Moreover, these models without characteristic length leads to serious mesh dependency due to strain localization.
In this paper, materials weaken by microcracks are considered as a matrixinclusions (cracks) system [10]. The physically-based homogenization scheme
developed by Ponte-Castaneda and Willis is adopted, in which the inclusions’
geometry and the spatial distribution can be simultaneously taken into account
by means of diﬀerent functions [11]. The PCW estimate is then applied to pennyshaped microcracks and integrated into the standard thermodynamics framework. In addition, a strain energy release rate based damage criterion is used to
determine the damage evolution in which interactions between microcracks are
involved. In order to overcome the consequences due to the strain localization,
a nonlocal formulation with material length is proposed. Finally, this model is
implemented into a ﬁnite element code. The numerical results obtained from 2D
problems show its predictive capacity and mesh independent characteristics.

Model Formulations
Basic Principles of Upscaling Methods

Consider the representative elementary volume (r.e.v.), occupying a domain Ω
and having a boundary surface ∂Ω, as a matrix-inclusion system, solid matrix
with the elasticity tensor Cs and inclusions with Cc,r ,r = 1, . . . , N . The local
behavior is assumed to be linear elastic: σ(z) = Cc (z) : ε(z) (∀ z ∈ Ω) with
σ(z) and ε(z) as the local stress and strain ﬁelds, respectively. By using the
superposition principle and taking the average of the local strain over Ω, the
general eﬀective (homogenized) elasticity tensor is expressed as follows:
N

Chom = Cs +

ϕr (Cc,r − Cs ) : Ac,r

(1)

r=1

where ϕr is the volume fraction representing the concentration of the inclusion
family r. Ac,r is so-called strain concentration tensor which relates in a linear
way the local strain ε to the macroscopic uniform strain E.
The determination of Eq.(1) is then summarized in determining the fourth
order concentration tensor Ac,r for which we can beneﬁt from the basic solution to the matrix-inclusion system of Eshelby’s problem. For many engineering
materials, it is useful to take into account both the inﬂuences of the shape of
inclusions and those of its spatial distribution. For this purpose, we are interested in the homogenization scheme developed by Ponte-Castaneda and Willis
in which two independent tensorial functions Pr (so-called Hill’s tensor) and Pd
are introduced to take into account the inﬂuences of the shape form of inclusions and of its spatial distribution on the material eﬀective properties [11]. The
corresponding eﬀective (homogenized) stiﬀness tensor reads:
Chom = Cs − Cd : I + Pd : Cd

Application to Cracked Mediums

We are now interested in microcracked materials. A family of cracks supposed to
be penny-shaped in this work can be approximated as ﬂat ellipsoids characterized
by its unit normal vector (orientation) n and the aspect ratio ac , noted , with a
as the radius of the circular crack and c as the half-length of the small axis. In
addition, it is possible do express the volume fraction ϕr of the rth cracks family
in the form:
4

(5)
ϕr = πa2r cr Nr = π dr

where Nr denotes the cracks density (number of cracks per unit volume) of the
family r, and dr = Nr a3r is the crack damage parameter widely used as internal
variables in micromechanical analysis [12].
The elasticity tensor Cc for open cracks is classically deﬁned by Cc = 0 to
account for the cancellation of the stress on the crack faces. On the basis of the
deﬁnition for damage parameters, the forth order tensor Cd in (3) is rewritten
in the following form:

The expression of Tr in the Walpose’s base are given in [13]. For simplifying
later formulations, it is convenient to rewrite Eq.(2) in the form:

in which we put B = I + Pd : Cd
is then given by derivation of the macroscopic free energy W (= 12 E : Chom : E)
with respect to E:

Damage Criterion and Evolution Law

In the framework of thermodynamics, the damage criterion should be determined
r
as a function of the conjugate force F d on the basis of experimental evidences.
However the determination of such a criterion is usually not easy. Note that the
r
expression of F d contains two linear terms in Tr , Cd and B, and one high order
term. For the sake of simpliﬁcation, only the two linear terms are used in damage
driving force.

where R(dr ) is the local resistance against the damage propagation. R(di ) =
c0 + c1 dr is adopted in this work, with c0 and c1 being two material constants.
Following the theoretical framework of generalized standard materials, we
adopt the normality rule in determination of damage evolutions:

Nonlocal Formulation

It is commonly recognized that the strain softening or damage-induced strength
degradation can be localized into a band of zero thickness with paradoxical
consequences of structural failure with zero energy dissipation. In order to overcome this shortcoming in continuum models without characteristic length, the
so-called non local approaches are widely used. The basic idea consists in replacr
ing the local damage force F˜ d for all considered families with its average over
a representative volume V of the material centered at a given point [14]. The
damage variable dr is then function of the non local driving force F˜ dr which will
be deﬁned as:
r
(x, y)F˜ d (y)dV (y).

F˜ dr (x) =

In Eq.(14), (x, y) is a space weight function which describes the mutual nonlocal interactions and depends only on the distance between the source point x and
the receiver point y. Mathematically, the normalization condition V (x, y)dV =
1 is required for a uniform ﬁeld. In this study, we adopt the following Gauss-type
weighting function,
(x, y) =

where Ndim is the number of spatial dimensions and l is a material characteristic
length which deﬁnes the size of interaction zone for failure processes. The factor
( l√12π )Ndim is used to satisfy the normalization condition.

Numerical Applications
3-Point Bending Test

Three-point bending test represents a structural case which may emphasize more
practical issues in terms of complexity and size when it comes to industrial
structures. The geometry and the loading condition of this test are shown in
Fig. 1. The parameters used in the analysis are as follows: E s = 3.7 × 104 MPa,
c0 = 1. × 10−3 J.m−2 and c1 = 5. × 10−4 J.m−2 . The structure is discretesized
respectively by 560 and 990 rectangle elements with 320 and 504 elements in
the zone |x| ≤ 50mm, respectively. The force-displacement relations and the
global damage distribution diagrams for the two meshes are shown and compared respectively in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, from which mesh independent properties
are observed. This kind of result is in agreement with most experimental data
reported in literature.

Conclusions

In this study, we present a new homogenization-based damage model with few
parameters. The micromechanical grounds provide the proposed model the capacity of dealing with main physical aspects such as unilateral eﬀects related to
cracks closures, the crack spatial distribution and interaction eﬀects between mi-

crocracks, which are generally neglected in widely-used macroscopic models. The
constitutive model is extended to the nonlocal version and implemented into a
ﬁnite element program. The numerical applications to concrete structures show
that the proposed micromechanics based model provides a promising tool to further capture and model the complex mechanical behaviors and failure process
in quasi brittle materials.
