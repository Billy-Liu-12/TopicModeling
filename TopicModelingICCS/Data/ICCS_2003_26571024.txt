Abstract. We use a three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model to investigate the spreading of mesoscale droplets on homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces. On a homogeneous substrate the base radius of the
droplet grows with time as t0 28 for a range of viscosities and surface
tensions. The time evolutions collapse onto a single curve as a function
of a dimensionless time. On a surface comprising of alternate hydrophobic and hydrophilic stripes the wetting velocity is anisotropic and the
equilibrium shape of the droplet reŞects the wetting properties of the
underlying substrate.

Introduction

Wetting processes, such as the spreading of a droplet over a surface, have attracted the attention of scientists for a long time ţ1ţ. A great deal is understood
about the wetting behaviour of equilibrium droplets. However less is known
about the dynamics of these systems, a problem of considerable industrial relevance with the advent of ink-jet printing. The droplets involved in printing
typically have length scales of microns. Experimental work on such mesoscopic
droplets is diŞcult and expensive because of the length- and time-scales involved.
Therefore there is a need for numerical modelling both to investigate the physics
and to help design and interpret the experiments.
Lattice Boltzmann models are a class of numerical techniques ideally suited
to probing the behaviour of Şuids on mesoscopic length scales ţ2ţ. Several lattice Boltzmann algorithms for a liquid-gas system have been reported in the
literature ţ3ť5ţ. They solve the Navier-Stokes equations of Şuid Şow but also
input thermodynamic information, typically either as a free energy or as effective microscopic interactions. They have proved successful in modelling such
diverse problems as Şuid Şows in complex geometries ţ6ţ, two-phase models ţ3,
4ţ, hydrodynamic phase ordering ţ7ţ and sediment transport in a Şuid ţ8ţ.
Here we show that it is possible to use a lattice Boltzmann approach to model
the spreading of mesoscale droplets and, in particular, to illustrate how a droplet
spreads on a substrate comprising of hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes.

Droplet Spreading on Heterogeneous Surfaces 1025

We consider a one-component, two-phase Şuid and use the free energy model
originally described by Swift et al. ţ3ţ with a correction to ensure Galilean invariance ţ9ţ. The advantage of this approach for the wetting problem is that it allows
us to tune equilibrium thermodynamic properties such as the surface tension or
static contact angle to agree with analytic predictions. Thus it is rather easy to
control the wetting properties of the substrate. Three dimensional simulations of
spreading on smooth and rough substrates have previously been reported in ţ10ţ
using a diŞerent lattice Boltzmann algorithm.
The paper is organised as follows. First we summarise the main features of the
lattice Boltzmann approach. The model is validated by showing the consistency
of the measured equilibrium contact angle with that predicted by Young's law
and by measuring the base radius of the spreading droplet as a function of time
obtaining, as expected, a power law growth. We show that when the reduced
base radius is plotted as a function of reduced time the data fall on a universal
curve for several values of surface tension and viscosity.
We then consider spreading on a heterogeneous substrate consisting of alternate hydrophobic and hydrophilic stripes. We Şnd that the spreading velocity
is anisotropic and that the Şnal droplet shape reŞects the wetting properties of
the underlying substrate. Finally, a conclusion suggests extensions to the work
presented here.

The Lattice Boltzmann Model

The lattice Boltzmann approach solves the Navier-Stokes equations by following
the evolution of partial distribution functions i on a regular, -dimensional
lattice formed of sites r. The label denotes velocity directions and runs between
0 and .
+1 is a standard lattice topology classiŞcation. The 3 15 lattice
topology we use here has the following velocity vectors vi : ෈0 0 0෉, ෈඲1 ඲1 ඲1෉,
෈඲1 0 0෉, ෈0 ඲1 0෉, ෈0 0 ඲1෉ in lattice units.
The lattice Boltzmann dynamics are given by

Wetting Boundary Conditions

In this paper, we will focus our attention on Şat substrates normal to the z
direction. The derivatives in that direction should then be handled in such a

Spreading on a Homogeneous Surface

We consider a 80 ථ 80 ථ 40 lattice on which a spherical drop of radius R0 = 16
just touches a Şat surface at z = 0. Unless otherwise speciŞed the temperature
is T = 0:4 which leads to two phases of density nl = 4:128 and ng = 2:913.
Fig. 1 shows how the droplet evolves in time to reach an equilibrium shape with

The equilibrium contact angle is 60Ş .

Fig. 1.

We Şrst present a check on the accuracy of the equilibrium properties of
the model. Fig. 2 reports a comparison between two methods of measuring the
contact angle. මy is the contact angle obtained from equation ෈9෉ with the surface
tensions measured at equilibrium. මg is the contact angle measured from the
proŞle of the simulated droplet once equilibrium is reached. The agreement is
good. Small errors results from the diŞculty of a direct measurement of the
contact angle on a discrete lattice.
The shape of the area formed by the contact of a droplet with a homogeneous
substrate is a disk. Its radius Rc is a quantity which is rather simple to measure
and has consequently attracted the attention of many scientists, see ţ17ţ and
references therein. The time evolution of Rc has been found to follow a power
law Rc = mtn=2. The exponent n has been widely reported in the literature but
with no consistent result. Marmur ţ17ţ in his review lists exponents between 0:06
and 0:6. The value of m appears to be related to the droplet volume.
Fig. 3 shows the time evolution of Rc for diŞerent values of the viscosity and
the surface tension. The curves correspond to a value n = 0:56 which is within

Spreading on Heterogeneous Surfaces

Almost any surface will contain physical and chemical inhomogeneities which will
aŞect the spreading of a mesoscopic droplet. It has recently become feasible to
fabricate surfaces with well-deŞned chemical properties on micron length scales
and it is becoming possible to perform well-controlled experiments which probe
the behaviour of mesoscopic droplets on chemically and physically heterogeneous
substrates. Thus it is particularly interesting to develop techniques to model the
eŞect of these surfaces on the spreading properties of a droplet.
One of the simplest heterogeneous surfaces can be formed by alternating
stripes of materials with diŞerent wetting properties. The static properties of
droplets on such substrates have been discussed ţ19ť21ţ. However less attention
has been paid to the dynamics of the spreading.
In this section we consider heterogeneous surfaces formed by alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes. They are characterised by widths wphi ,wpho
and contact angles මphi , මpho respectively. Fig. 4 presents the behaviour of a

three-dimensional droplet spreading on such a surface with මphi = 50Ş , මpho =
110Ş, wphi = 6, wpho = 5. The droplet has an initial radius R0 = 18.
It is apparent from the Şgure that the behaviour of the droplet depends on
whether it is on a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic stripe. The equilibrium shape of
the contact line shown in Şg. 4෈b෉ reŞects the pattern of the underlying substrate
which is comparable to that found in laboratory experiments ţ20ţ.
The time evolution of the contact line is also shown in Şg. 4෈b෉. Note that
its velocity decreases smoothly in the y-direction parallel to the stripes but
not in the x-direction where it moves faster on the hydrophilic than on the
hydrophobic stripes. Note also that the droplet remains symmetric about an
axis perpendicular to the stripes but that the shape becomes asymmetric about
an axis parallel to the stripes, depending upon the initial position of the center
of the droplet.
Observation of the movement of the contact line in the x-direction shows that
in a hydrophilic region the contact angle tends to decrease and the velocity of the
contact line increase. When the contact line reaches the boundary its progress
is stopped and the contact angle increases until it is large enough to cross the
hydrophobic stripe.
It has been proposed that an equilibrium droplet on such a surface has a
spatially averaged contact angle following Cassie's law ţ21ţ
cos ම = pphi cos මphi + ppho cos මpho

෈14෉

where pphi and ppho are the proportion of the substrate area which are hydrophilic or hydrophobic respectively. However, this relation is not universally
accepted. In particular it has been argued that there should be a dependence on
the relative size of the droplet and the surface stripes ţ19ţ. Fig. 4෈c෉-෈d෉ show

5 Conclusion
We have used a three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann algorithm to model the
spreading of a mesoscopic droplet. By incorporating the Cahn theory of wetting
into the simulation we obtain a way of easily tuning the contact angle of the
droplet on the substrate. This gives us the ability to simulate spreading on both
homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces.
The approach provides a well-controlled way of investigating the dependence
of the spreading on such properties as the droplet volume, contact angles and
the substrate geometry. Further work is in progress to systematically determine
how these parameters aŞect the velocity and shapes of the spreading droplets.
It would also be interesting to investigate the eŞect of physical inhomogeneities
on the spreading and to consider a droplet spreading on a porous surface.
A particular aim of the work will be to compare the results to forthcoming
experiments on substrates which have chemical patterning on mesoscopic length
scale. This will allow increased understanding of both the experimental results
and the model assumptions. For example we assume, as is the standard practice,
no-slip boundary conditions on the velocity. These may not be appropriate on
short length scales near a contact line. Moreover the liquid-gas density diŞerence in lattice Boltzmann models is very small compared to real Şuids and it is
important to undertake further work to assess the eŞect of this on the modelling
results.
