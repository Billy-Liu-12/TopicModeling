Abstract
A hybrid simulation model is developed to determine the cost-minimizing target level for a singleitem, single-stage production-inventory system. The model is based on a single discrete-event
simulation of the unconstrained production system, from which an analytical approximation of the
inventory shortfall is derived. Using this analytical expression it is then possible to evaluate inventory
performance, and associated costs, at any target level. From these calculations, the cost-minimizing
target level can then be found efficiently using a local search. Computational experiments show that
model accuracy is preserved at high levels of demand variation, where existing analytical methods are
known to be unreliable. By deriving an expression for the shortfall distribution via simulation, no user
modelling of the demand distribution or estimation of demand parameters is required. Thus this model
can be applied to situations when the demand distribution does not have an identifiable analytical form

1 Introduction
When customer demand is stochastic and production capacity constrained, inventory managers will
typically hold safety stock in order to satisfy demand that cannot be met from the current period’s
production. The amount of safety stock held in a given production system depends on a manager’s
preference for a particular service level or the wish to minimize the inventory costs due to holding
stock and addressing stock out incidents. The amount of safety stock held, on average, in the inventory
system when a base stock inventory policy is used is determined by the inventory target level. This is
the amount of inventory remaining each period after the production-supply cycle is completed.
In order to set the target level, managers require an accurate model of the inventory shortfall at the
end of each production-supply cycle. The shortfall distribution can be modeled exactly only when the
state space is small, (Muckstadt & Sapra, 2010), and quickly becomes intractable for practical
problems. As an alternative, the shortfall distribution can be approximated by a continuous
distribution, although parameter estimation becomes inaccurate when the variability of customer
demand is large (Roundy & Muckstadt, 2000). This approximation is also difficult to implement in

many practical situations because it requires that the demand distribution can be modelled by a
continuous probability distribution function. As a consequence the only recourse left to a practitioner
is discrete-event simulation. However using simulation as a means of optimization is inefficient.
This paper proposes an alternative to traditional simulation-optimization by using a hybrid
simulation model, which integrates elements of both discrete-event simulation and optimization into a
unified model. Hybrid simulation models have been successfully applied to areas as diverse as tactical
airborne operations (Briggs, Mollaghasemi, & Sepulveda, 1995), modelling of x-ray computed
tomography images (Ay & Zaidi, 2007), and computer systems performance optimization (Chise &
Jurca, 2011).
For the model presented in this paper, the inventory shortfall distribution is modeled from a single
discrete-event simulation of the unconstrained production-supply system. This is the only simulation
required for the complete simulation-optimization procedure. Once the inventory shortfall distribution
has been approximated, the optimal economy-based or service-based policy is then efficiently
calculated using search techniques. By requiring no simulation trials other than the initial simulation
of the shortfall distribution, this model is highly efficient compared with existing simulation-based
approaches to inventory optimization.
Previous research by the author (Betts, 2011, 2014) demonstrated the feasibility of this approach
for setting inventory target levels in order to achieve a desired service level. This current research
extends the previous research by calculating target levels that minimize total inventory costs.
Extensive computational testing across a wide variety of customer demand distributions, resource
utilization levels and inventory cost variation shows that the new, hybrid simulation model is highly
accurate compared with existing analytical models, and efficient compared with traditional simulationbased optimization.
The following section describes the production system studied, and existing approaches to setting
inventory target levels. Section 3 introduces the hybrid simulation model. Computational experiments
are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 A Production Inventory Model
The hybrid simulation model is developed for a single-item, single-stage, inventory system. This
model assumes that at the start of each period, random demand, Dt , is observed. Production, up to a
maximum of C units per period then occurs. If the quantity produced in addition to the amount
currently held in inventory is greater than the demand during the period, then all customer demand is
filled, otherwise the unmet demand is back ordered, to be supplied in a later period. This generic
model forms the basis of many inventory control systems and its behavior is well understood, for
example, (Muckstadt, 2005; Muckstadt & Sapra, 2010; Roundy & Muckstadt, 2000).
The optimal way to manage this inventory system is to use a base stock policy, (Federgruen &
Zipkin, 1986a, 1986b). This requires that managers set a target level, s , which is the amount of stock
ideally held at the end of each production-supply cycle. Because demand is random, shortages will
occur in periods where production is not sufficient to meet demand. The inventory shortfall each
period, vt = s − I t , where I t represents the inventory level at the end of each period. Thus

[ ]

vt = max(vt −1 + Dt − C, 0). Assuming that average demand, E Dt , is smaller than the production

constraint means that an infinite backlog of unmet demand does not build up. Under this condition a
steady state distribution exists for vt , denoted by V (Muckstadt, 2005). Modelling the shortfall
distribution is a necessary first stage in calculating inventory costs and service levels.
When demand is discrete and the inventory state space is small, the inventory shortfall can be
modelled exactly as a Markov chain, with V being the limiting distribution of the transition matrix

(Feller, 1968; Muckstadt, 2005). Because these conditions are rarely met in practice it is more usual to
assume that demand is continuous. Under this condition, V is also continuous and can be
approximated by a mass exponential distribution (Glasserman, 1997; Muckstadt, 2005; Roundy &
Muckstadt, 2000). Using FV to denote the complementary cumulative distribution function of V ,

⎧⎪P e−γv , v > 0
FV (v ) = ⎨ 0
⎪⎩0,
otherwise.

(1)

FV is a good approximation to V for many demand distributions, with analytical expressions
estimating γ derived for a number of common distributions (Glasserman, 1997). However, the
approximation of FV has several limitations for situations commonly encountered by practitioners.
The first is that estimates of the parameters P0 and γ are not reliable when demand has a coefficient
of variation greater than 2 (Roundy & Muckstadt, 2000). This excludes the use of this approximation
in cases of high variability such as lumpy demand (Hollier, Mak, & Yiu, 2005; Nenes, Panagiotidou,
& Tagaras, 2010), which is frequently encountered in practice. The second is that these estimates
require that the demand distribution can be estimated by a continuous probability distribution,
expressible in functional form, which is not practical for many real-world situations. Finally, the
modelling and estimation of the demand distribution limits the applicability of this model to only those
practitioners with a high degree of mathematical skill.
When the inventory shortfall cannot be modeled using an exact Markov method, or approximated
by the mass exponential distribution (Equation 1), for example, in cases of high demand variability,
discrete-event simulation of the system may be used to set inventory target levels based on costminimization or desired service level. This method is time consuming, however, as multiple trials are
typically required to determine the optimal policy setting when the solution space is large. The
optimization process may be made more efficient by metamodelling (Arreola-Risa, Giménez-García,
& Martínez-Parra, 2011; Banks, Carson, & Nelson, 1996; Kleijnen, 2008) or the use of metaheuristics,
for example, (Can & Heavey, 2012). However, notwithstanding these aids to optimization, the process
remains unwieldy and time consuming. By contrast, this paper presents a hybrid simulation model
whereby the shortfall distribution is simulated directly from the demand and production data and the
parameters estimated using an efficient search technique. This process requires that only a single
simulation trial is conducted, from which the subsequent optimization calculations are made. Based on
the modelled shortfall distribution, the target level required for cost minimization or service level
satisfaction is calculated using efficient search, without the need to conduct subsequent simulations.
Thus the new model is computationally efficient compared with simulation-based optimization
methods.

3 A Hybrid Simulation Model
This section presents the hybrid model. Subsection 3.1 describes the discrete-event simulation
component of the model and the estimation of the parameters of the inventory shortfall distribution.
Subsection 3.2 then describes the calculation of inventory performance measures required for
optimization. Subsection 3.3 presents the complete algorithm.

3.1 Modelling the Inventory Shortfall Distribution
The inventory shortfall distribution, V , is approximated using a sample taken from a discreteevent simulation of the production-supply process. Demand is randomly chosen from the observed

761

Minimizing Inventory Costs for Capacity-Constrained Production ...

historical demand taken over k time periods, D = {D1 , D2 ,..., Dk } . Production is subject to the
constraint, C . The trajectory of the inventory level, I t , is a random walk (Feller, 1968). Only a single
simulation run is required, since E[Dt ] < C means that the process is ergodic. Samples are taken at
large enough intervals, M , to assume independence, continuing until sufficient samples, N , are
obtained. The discrete-event simulation used for modelling the shortfall distribution differs from the
simulation of a real production process in three ways: firstly, it is assumed that the target level, s = 0 ;
secondly, that all demand is supplied; and the finally, that the inventory shortfall is unbounded. These
assumptions mean that the simulated shortfall, Vt , lies in the range [0, ∞ ) , enabling an accurate
estimate of γ to be made.
The parameters P0 and γ are estimated from the simulated shortfall distribution V = {v1, v2 ,...vN }
by first sorting the elements in ascending order and then partitioning V into an upper and lower
subsets. The lower subset V L = {v1, v2 ...vx }, which typically contains many vi = 0 , yields the estimate
x
H
P0 = . γ is estimated from the upper subset V = {vx+1, vx+2 ...vN } by fitting a least squares line of
N
i −1
. The
best fit of each vi against its log-transformed fractiles, determined as pi = P V H < v xH+i =
N−x
line of best fit theoretically contains the origin (Fraile & Garcia-Ortega, 2005) and has gradient γ .

(

)

Calculating P0 and γ , requires that requires that x be varied until the regression equation yields an
intercept closest to 0. The computation of x is efficient since the intercept of the least squares
regression equation is strictly increasing as x increases, allowing binary search to be used,
commencing with terminals x lower = 1 and xupper = N .

3.2 Modelling Total Expected Variable Inventory Cost
The total variable inventory cost is made up of the cost of holding the stock on hand from one
period to the next, and the cost of stock supplied as back orders. These costs are now expressed as
functions of demand, D , production constraint, C , inventory target level, s , and the shortfall
distribution, FV . Because demand, D1,D2 ,..., Dk , and inventory level, v , are both discrete, a discrete
approximation to the continuous mass exponential inventory shortfall distribution is made for the
computation of expected values. Accordingly the upper tail FV (v ) is approximated as fV (0) = P0 and
f v (v ) = FV (v − 1) − FV (v ) for v = 1,2,3... .
The inventory held at the end of each period which is carried over to the next, vt , has expected
value E (v ) = (1 − P0 )

s

∑ ( fv (s − v)v) .

Using Bt to denote the amount of stock not supplied in any

v =0

period, Bt = max(Dt − C − (s − vt −1 ),0), where the stock on hand at commencement of the period is
s − vt −1 , and demand is Dt . Taking the expected value over

Using p and q to represent the per period unit holding cost and back order costs respectively, the
expected total inventory cost (TIC) per period is

E(TIC) = pE(v) + qE(B).

The determination of the value of s that minimizes TIC only requires a single simulation of the
inventory process. Because TIC is a discrete convex function, the TIC-minimizing value of s may be
calculated using non-linear integer programming (Jèunger, Liebling, & Naddef, 2010).

4 Computational Experiments
The accuracy of the hybrid simulation algorithm was tested by comparing the performance
measures of the production-inventory system predicted by the algorithm at the TIC-minimizing target
level against those obtained from a conventional discrete-event simulation of the inventory system
operating under the same parameters and using the calculated target level as an input. Details of the
performance measures are given in Section 4.3. 200,000 trials were run, with input parameters chosen
randomly from those outlined in Section 4.1 and the demand distributions described in Section 4.2.

The results and analysis in Section 4.4 show that the hybrid simulation algorithm retains its accuracy
across a diverse variety of demand types and operating parameters, indicating its utility for practical
applications.

4.1 Input Parameters
The following parameters were set independently of customer demand distribution. These were
chosen to reflect values that could occur in reality but were also varied sufficiently to reflect a wide
range of operating conditions.
C , production capacity, was determined by the slack ratio, S , where C = E[Dk ] + Sσ D , (Roundy
& Muckstadt, 2000). In the following experiments S was chosen randomly from 2, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1,
0.05 and 0.02 to yield production ranging from minimally constrained to highly constrained.
q , inventory back order cost was set as a multiple of the holding cost, ( p = 1), in powers of two
increments across the range q = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, … , 128.
k , the number of historical demand observations used for modelling and simulation was randomly
chosen from: k = 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512.

N , the number of samples used for model building was set at N

= 100,000.

M , the interval between recording each sample was set at M = 1,000.

4.2 Simulated Demand Distributions
The randomly generated demand distributions followed those used by Roundy and Muckstadt
(Roundy & Muckstadt, 2000) augmented by the inclusion of the contaminated normal distribution to
reflect extremely lumpy demand (Hollier, et al., 2005). Data was generated with mean, μ , chosen at
random on the interval [1 : 200] . Standard deviation, σ , was specified as a multiple of μ , chosen
randomly on the interval (0 : 3] for two parameter distributions. The sampling of each of the demand
distribution was as follows:

Normal distribution: Dt ∈ N μ ,σ 2 rejecting any Dt < 0 to obtain k samples.

otherwise,

Truncated Exponential random variables were sampled from f D (x ) =

he hx

, 0 < x < 1, h > 0 .
eh −1
The shape parameter, h , was varied to produce samples having expected values of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8
and 0.9 respectively. Random variables were then rescaled to have mean μ .
Gamma family random variables were generated having shape parameters κ = 0.0625, 0.25, 1 and
4, and scaled to have mean μ .

(

)

Uniform random variables were randomly sampled from Dt ∈ U μ − 3σ , μ + 3σ , where

μ − 3σ ≥ 0 .

4.3 Performance Measures
The error of each performance measure was calculated by comparing that predicted by the hybrid
simulation model against that obtained by a conventional discrete-event simulation of the inventory
system operating with the same parameter settings and target level recommended by the hybrid
simulation as inputs. The duration of discrete-event simulation used for testing was the same as that

used in the hybrid simulation algorithm, that is, MN (100,000,000) periods. The random variability
introduced by a discrete-event simulation of this duration was of the order of 0.01% for all error
calculations. The number of expected back orders and the expected end of period inventory as well as
two service levels are also calculated at the cost-minimizing inventory target level. These are: Type 1
Service, α , the probability that all demand in any period can be met without delay, and Type 2
Service, β , or fill rate, the proportion of demand that is supplied without delay. Mean Absolute
Percent Error (MAPE) was calculated for total inventory cost, expected back orders and expected end
of period inventory. Service level accuracy is reported as absolute error. Each of the performance
measures is summarized below:

4.4 Results
Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the error calculations for each of the performance measures grouped by:
σ
, respectively. Table 1
back order cost, q , demand distribution type, and coefficient of variation,
μ
shows that as back order cost increases, the error associated with E(TIC) also increases. For the most
extreme case studied, when the ratio of back order cost to holding cost is 1,024:1, the mean absolute
error is of the order of 4%. It can be seen from Table 1 that contributing to the error in E(TIC) is an
increase in E(B) due to the actual number of back orders decreasing, which increases MAPE via the
denominator. Although errors in E(B) are large when the ratio of back order to holding costs is large,
their net effect on E(TIC) is moderate. The converse occurs for predicted inventory level, E(v ), when
back order cost is high. In this situation large target levels reduce MAPE. At low back order cost,
almost no inventory is held, and consequently E (v ) is close to zero.

Table 1 also shows that the errors in predicted Type 1 and Type 2 service are consistently less than
0.005% for all q . Thus, the predicted service level given by hybrid simulation at the cost-minimizing
target level is highly accurate, independent of the actual service level since the variation in q and
other parameters ensures a wide variety of actual service levels.
The effect of demand distribution on performance measurement errors is shown in Table 2. The
demand distributions chosen reflect a wide variety with regard to symmetry, skewness and kurtosis.
The results show that the performance of the hybrid simulation model is largely unaffected by the
form of the demand distribution, with the average error in predicted E(TIC) of the order of 1.5%
across all distributions. E (B ) is consistent across all demand distributions at approximately 5% and

E(v ) at approximately 2%. Type 1 and Type 2 service errors are all smaller than 0.3% on average.
The effect of demand variability is shown in Table 3. It can be seen that the error in predicted

E(TIC) diminishes as volatility increases. The error in predicted E (B ) and E(v ) also diminishes at
higher demand volatility due to the increase in target level required to service the increased volatility.

existing analytical methods are known to be inaccurate (Roundy & Muckstadt, 2000).
Other parameters varied included resource utilization and the number of historical observations
used for model building, k . However these factors did not have any significant effect on the accuracy
of the hybrid simulation model.

5 Summary and Conclusion
This paper has introduced a hybrid simulation model to calculate the cost-minimizing target level
when production is subject to a capacity constraint. The model requires that a single discrete-event
simulation be conducted, from which the inventory shortfall distribution is then determined. Once this
stage is complete, optimization is then conducted efficiently using non-linear integer programming.
This hybrid approach has advantages over existing methods. Firstly, no user estimation of the demand
distribution is required, enabling use by practitioners without sophisticated mathematical skills or
application in situations where the observed demand distribution does not have a clear functional
form. Secondly, the model remains accurate under high demand volatility where existing analytical
methods cannot be used. Finally, the model is computationally efficient compared with existing
simulation-optimization approaches because only a single simulation trial is required.
Computational experiments have shown that the hybrid simulation model remains accurate across
the range of operating conditions that a practitioner could reasonably expect, including situations of
high demand variability. Because the new model does not require user estimation of the demand
distribution, it is easily used by managers in practice or implemented as standalone software.
