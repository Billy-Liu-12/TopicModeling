Abstract. Muscular fatigue refers to temporary decline of maximal
power ability or contractive ability for muscle movement system. The signal of surface electromyographic signal (sEMG) can reﬂect the changes
of muscular fatigue at certain extent. In many years, the application
of signal of sEMG on evaluation muscular fatigue mainly focus on two
aspects of time and frequency respectively. The new method HilbertHuang Transform(HHT) has the powerful ability of analyzing nonlinear
and non-stationary data in both time and frequency aspect together. The
method has self-adaptive basis and is better for feature extraction as we
can obtain the local and instantaneous frequency of the signals. In this
paper, we chose an experiment of the static biceps data of twelve adult
subjects under the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of 80%. The
experimental results proved that this method as a new thinking has an
obvious potential for the biomedical signal analysis.

Introduction

Muscular fatigue [1] is an exercise-induced reduction in maximal voluntary muscle force. It may arise not only because of peripheral changes at the level of the
muscle, but also because the central nervous system fails to drive the motoneurons adequately. The measurement of the muscular fatigue is according to the
decline of the system maximal function. The adaptation of the neuromuscular
system to heavy resistance exercise is a very complex result of many factors.
This implies central and peripheral neural adaptations as well as chemical and
morphological modiﬁcations of muscle tissue.
Surface electromyographic signal (sEMG) is an one-dimensional time series
signal of neuromuscular system that recorded for skin surface, the time-frequency

domain and nonlinear dynamical characters of it are sensitive to the intensity
and state for muscular activities and therefore it is a valuable method for muscle
functional evaluation. For many years, the analysis of sEMG concentrated on two
main ﬁelds, time domain and the frequency domain [2]. The common use way of
traditional time domain analysis is to regard the sEMG signal as the function
of time, using some indicators like Integrated EMG (IEMG) or some statistical
features such as Root Mean Square(RMS). In aspect of spectrum analysis, the
typical method is the Fast Fourier Transform short as FFT. The spectrum we
acquire from the FFT can show the distribution of the signals in diﬀerent frequency component quantitatively. In order to portray the characteristic of the
spectrum, researchers often use the following two indicators: Median Frequency
(MF) and Mean Power Frequency (MPF) [3].
Most research works have found that the indicators of frequency analysis of
the muscles in limbs and waist have good regularity in the condition of the
static burthen. The main manifestation is the decline of the MPF or MF and
the increase of power spectrum or the ratio of the low/high frequency during the
process of fatiguing [4] [5]. However, under the dynamic condition, the alteration
of the MPF and MF during the fatiguing process exist considerable diﬀerence
from which can hardly get a universal conclusion. On account of above, we chose
the static biceps data which have remarkable features of fatiguing to test our
new method’s performance in this paper.

The Method of Hilbert - Huang Transform

A new method [6] for analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been
developed in 1998 by N. E. Huang and others who lately made some amelioration on this method [7] in 1999. The key part of the method is the Empirical
Mode Decomposition (EMD) method with which any complicated data set can
be decomposed into a ﬁnite and often small number of Intrinsic Mode Functions
(IMF) that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method
is adaptive, and, therefore, highly eﬃcient. Since the decomposition is based on
the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and
non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the IMF functions yield
instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identiﬁcations of
imbedded structures. The ﬁnal presentation of the results is the energy - frequency - time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method,
the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of IMF based on local
properties of the signal, which makes the instantaneous frequency meaningful.
The method of Hilbert - Huang Transform (HHT) is composed of two parts:
ﬁrst one is the process of EMD which generate the products called IMF, and the
second one it the traditional Hilbert transform and analysis on these IMF. IMF
is a function that satisﬁes two conditions: (1) in the whole data set, the number
of extremal and the number of zero crossings must either equal or diﬀer at most
by one; and (2) at any point, the mean value of the envelope deﬁned by the local
maxima and the envelope deﬁned by the local minima is zero.

142

B. Peng et al.

Find out all the local maxima and minima of the original signal. Once the
extremal are identiﬁed, all the local maxima are connected by a cubic spline line
as the upper envelope. Repeat the procedure for the local minima to produce
the lower envelope. The upper and lower envelopes should cover all the data
between them. Their mean is designated as m1, and the diﬀerence between the
data and m1 is the ﬁrst component, h1 .
X(t) − m1 = h1

(1)

Then, we have to judge whether h1 be the IMF according to the requirements
mentioned above. If not satisfy, the sifting process has to be repeated more times.
In the second sifting process, h1 is treated as the data, then,
h1 − m11 = h11

(2)

We can repeat this sifting procedure k times, until h1k is an IMF, that is:
h1(k−1) − m1k = h1k

(3)

c1 = h1k

(4)

Then, it is designated as:
The c1 is the IMF component for the original signal. We can separate c1 from
the rest of the data by
(5)
X(t) − c1 = r1
Since the residue, r1 , still contains information of longer period components, it
is treated as the new data and subjected to the same sifting process as described
above. This procedure can be repeated on all the subsequent rj s, and the result
is:
(6)
r1 − c2 = r2 , · · · , rn−1 − cn = rn
The sifting process can be stopped, when the residue, rn , becomes a monotonic
function from which no more IMF can be extracted. By summing up equations
(5) and (6), we ﬁnally obtain
n

ci + rn

X(t) =

(7)

i=1

Having obtained the intrinsic mode function components, we will have no diﬃculties in applying the Hilbert transform to each component, and computing the
instantaneous frequency according to the following steps. For an arbitrary time
series, X(t), we can always have its Hilbert Transform, Y (t), as
Y (t) =

1
P
π

+∞
−∞

X(t )
dt
t−t

(8)

where P indicates the Cauchy principal value. With this deﬁnition, X(t) and
Y (t) form the complex conjugate pair, so we can have an analytic signal, Z(t),
as
Z(t) = X(t) + iY (t) = a(t)eiθ(t)
(9)

in which we can also write as
a(t) = [X 2 (t) + Y 2 (t)]
θ(t) = arctan

Y (t)
X(t)

(10)
(11)

and the instantaneous frequency deﬁned as
d θ(t)
(12)
dt
After performing the Hilbert transform on each IMF component, we can express
the data in the following form:
ω=

n

X(t) =

aj (t)exp i

ωj (t)d t

(13)

j=1

The equation also enables us to represent the amplitude and the instantaneous
frequency as functions of time in a three-dimensional plot, in which the amplitude
can be contoured on the frequency - time plane. This frequency- time distribution
of the amplitude is designated as the Hilbert amplitude spectrum, H(ω; t), or
simply Hilbert spectrum. If amplitude squared is more desirable commonly to
represent energy density, then the squared values of amplitude can be substituted
to produce the Hilbert energy spectrum just as well.
With the Hilbert spectrum deﬁned, we can also deﬁne the marginal spectrum,
h(ω), as
T

H(ω, t)d t

h(ω) =

(14)

0

In addition to the marginal spectrum, we can also deﬁne the instantaneous energy density level, IE, as
H 2 (ω, t)d ω

IE(t) =

(15)

and the marginal energy spectrum ES, as
T

H 2 (ω, t)d t

ES(ω) =

Although the HHT is a powerful method for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary data, it has deﬁciencies also. Some research work has been done to
ameliorate this [8]. However, the application of HHT in many ﬁelds have proved
its performance exceed the traditional one-dimensional time series signals analysis methods [9][10][11][12].

Subjects were ﬁrst allowed to warm up the biceps. Then the wrists of the subjects
were burdened with a weight of 80% MVC until they exhausted. During the
procedures, signals were recorded with the sampling frequency of 1000Hz.

Results and Analysis

We deal with the data by the HHT, and Fig.1 shows the energy - frequency time distribution of a sample sEMG (80% MVC) which we continue to use in
Fig.2 and Fig.3, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. The brighter denote the
higher energy and the darker denote the lower. Roughly, we can see from the
Fig.1 the frequency distribution is wide at the beginning and concentrated to
the lower frequency at the end, and in Fig.1, We can also see the energy became
higher by the time variable for the right part of the spectrum is brighter than the

left. We draw a conclusion qualitatively that during the process of the muscle
fatigue test, the frequency is going down and the energy is increasing. We get
more detailed and obvious features from further analysis below.
Fig.2(a) shows the changing trend of instantaneous energy (IE) by the factor
of time. We can see the energy approximately go up during the whole fatiguing
process. In Fig.2(b), we can see clearly that the instantaneous frequency is going
down during the fatiguing process. To calculate the instantaneous frequency,
please consult formulas. The ordinary way is to use the indicator MF or MPF
[3]. During the fatiguing course, the MF is move leftward, means the frequency
deceases generally. So, our results is consistent with the traditional approachs
and more convenient and evident [13].
In order to contrast, we extract the ﬁrst second and last second of the signals
to test together, which we can see even more obviously the changes by fatiguing.
In the following analyzing, we use the average 80%MVC data of the twelve whole
subjects.

Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b) show the Hilbert spectrum of the ﬁrst second and the
last second of the average samples. Because the experiment was ended when the
subjects were exhausted, so we can consider the muscles were in the state of
fatigue in the last second. In contrast to Fig.3(a), frequency is concentrate to
the lower and the energy is higher in Fig.3(b). Although Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b)
is the small sections of the Fig.1 in which they ampliﬁed the features of fatigue.
Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b) show the energy’s distribution on the frequency. We
can see the frequency of the last second is concentrate to the lower frequency
relatively and the energy is much higher than the ﬁrst second’s. This alteration
is even much remarkable in Fig.4(c) and Fig.4(d) which show the varying by the
time variable.

Conclusion

In this paper, we adopted a new method-HHT, which is good at processing
nonlinear and non-stationary data in two dimensions of both time domain and
frequency domain to research the sEMG signal to ﬁnd the features of muscular
fatigue. We choose twelve adult university students as the experimental subjects.
All the results we gained above are very consistent with the experiential conclusion that the frequency is going down and the energy is going up in the process of
muscular fatiguing in [4][5]. The results also have proved that the HHT method
has good performance and massive potential in analyzing the biomedical signals.
However, the results in this paper are preliminary exploration, more works have
to be done in the furture, even the HHT itself has some defects to ameliorate.
Anyway, the HHT method has showed the extensive applicable foreground.
