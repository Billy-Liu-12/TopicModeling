Abstract. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) with polynomial kernel function based nonlinear model multi-step-ahead controller is presented. A
SVM based multi-step-ahead predictive model is established by black-box identification. And control law is obtained by numerical and optimization methods
respectively. The effect of controller is demonstrated on a recognized benchmark problem. Simulation results show that multi-step-ahead predictive controller can be well applied to nonlinear system with good performance.

1 Introduction
Model predictive control (MPC) is a class of control algorithms in which a process
model is used to predict and optimize process performance [1]. Now, attention has
turned to nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) [2] because many industrial
processes are intrinsically nonlinear. Recently a new kind of learning machine called
SVM [3,4], which is well used for function regression and time series prediction, can be
used for nonlinear system identification and system control. This paper puts forward a
new approach to NMPC based on SVM with quadratic polynomial kernel function.
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, a SVM with polynomial kernel function based multi-step-ahead predictive model and control algorithm for nonlinear
systems are discussed. Simulation results on a recognized benchmark problem are
given in section 3. In section 4, some conclusions are put forward. For more details
about SVM regression with polynomial kernel function, see references [3,4].

2 SVM Based NMPC
2.1 Nonlinear Predictive Control Model
Assume the j -step-ahead ( j = 1" P , P is prediction horizon) nonlinear model can
be described by SVM form:
y m (k + j ) = f ( I k + j ) = f [ y (k + j − 1), y(k + j − 2),", y(k − n + j ),
u(k + j − 1), u(k + j − 2),", u(k − n + j )]
nsv

∑ a (I

⋅ I k + j + 1) 2 + b

i =1

s.t.

u min ≤ u ≤ u max

Where n , m are determined by approximation accuracy. Support values
a i (i = 1,", nsv ) and bias value b can be gotten through learning according to d

pairs training data {I s , y}( s = 1, ", d ) . I ' is the set of support vectors from I s . And
assume when j > M , u (k + j − 1) = u (k + M − 1) , M is control horizon.
Introduce feedback correction to deal with the model error and disturbance, so the
j -step-ahead closed-loop predictive output at time k is:

y p ( k + j ) = y m ( k + j ) + h j e( k )

(2)

Where h j is the error correcting coefficient, e(k ) = y (k ) − y m ( k ) .
2.2 Nonlinear Predictive Controller

Select optimization objective function with moving horizon as below:
P

min J (k ) =

∑ q [ y (k + j ) − y
j

r

p (k

+ j )]2

(3)

j =1

Where q j are weighting coefficients, y r (k + j ) is reference value from trajectory:
y r (k + j ) = a rj y (k ) + (1 − a rj ) y sp
Where

y r (k ) = y (k )

(4)

a r is the coefficient related with system’s robustness and y sp is set point

value.
Case of P = M :
In this case, nonlinear optimization problem (3) contains M manipulate variables
and M equality constraint of model outputs. Use known y p (k − 1 + j / k − 1) replace

unknown y (k − 1 + j ) , where y p ( k − 1 + j / k − 1) is the closed-loop predictive output.
min J (k ) = q1[ y r (k + 1) − y p (k + 1)]2 + q 2 [ y r (k + 2) − y p (k + 2)]2

J1 ( k ) contains u ( k )

J 2 ( k ) contains u ( k ),u ( k +1)

J M ( k ) contains u ( k ),u ( k +1),",u ( k + M )

It’s a common sense that the first-step controller output u (k ) outweighs the others, so
we can first minimize J 1 (k ) to get u (k ) , and then substitute u (k ) into J 2 (k ) to get

u (k + 1) . Recursively, we can get all u (k + j − 1) .
∂J j (k )
∂u (k + j − 1)

∂y p (k + j )
∂u ( k + j − 1)

It’s a cubic equation with only one unknown bounded variable, and it’s easily solved.

Case of P > M :
Consider nonlinear optimization problem (3) with P > M , this is a nonlinear optimal
problem with equality constraint of model output and boundary constraint of
controller output. In this paper, Nelder-Mead simplex direct search method is used to
optimize and obtain M unknown variables. And we will use solutions obtained by
algorithm in section 2.2.1 as starting point.

3 Experimental and Simulation Results
The example is a benchmark problem used by Narendra & Parthasarathy[5], and
further studied by Kambhampati[2] using a Gaussian neural network to fulfill the onestep-ahead predictive control. Set C = 10000 , ε = 0.001 , h j = 1 , q j = 1 .

y (k + 1) =

y (k )
1 + y (k )

where y is the plant output and u ∈ [−2,2] is the input.
150 pairs data generated by applying by a series of random numbers between [-2,2]
are used to train the SVM predictive model with m = n = 5 . And set y sp = 1.5
and a r = 0.9 . Fig.2 is the system output and controller output with P = 2, M = 2 .
Fig.3 is the system output and controller output with P = 4, M = 2 . In both cases, a
disturbance rejection (d=0.1) is added when system is in steady state at time k=100,
and the output response will track the set point well again quickly.

4 Conclusions
In this paper two cases of SVM with polynomial kernel function based nonlinear
model multi-step-ahead predictive control strategies are investigated. The effect of
both controllers is demonstrated by a benchmark problem. The analysis and experiment results show that the control strategy will provide a robust stable control of
nonlinear systems with good performance in keeping reference trajectory and disturbance-rejection.
