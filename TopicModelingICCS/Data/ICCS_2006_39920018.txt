Abstract. The dynamical evolution of a chemically reacting system is
governed by the equations of chemical kinetics, which exhibit a wide
range of time scales thus giving rise to stiﬀ equations. In the ratecontrolled constrained equilibrium method (RCCE), the dynamical evolution of the system is governed by the kinetics of the species associated
with the slower timescales (kinetically controlled), while the remaining
species are calculated via a constrained minimisation of the Gibbs free
energy of the mixture. This permits the derivation of a general set of
diﬀerential-algebraic equations, which apply to any reduced system given
a particular selection of kinetically controlled species. In this paper, it is
shown how the diﬀerential-algebraic formulation of RCCE can be derived
from ﬁrst principles, in the form of an extension of the computation of
chemical equilibrium via miminisation of the free energy. Subsequently,
RCCE is employed to reduce a comprehensive combustion mechanism
and to calculate the burning velocity of premixed H2 -O2 and CH4 -air
ﬂames under a range of pressures and equivalence ratios.

Introduction

Chemical kinetics describes the dynamical evolution of a chemical system via a
set of rate equations for all the species and radicals involved, and all possible
elementary reactions. Such comprehensive mechanisms often comprise very large
numbers of species and reactions, and their integration is additionally hampered
by excessive stiﬀness, due to the presence of a vast range of chemical time scales.
Combustion is a classic example, where hundreds of reactions are often included
in detailed mechanisms, and in addition they must be coupled with ﬂuid ﬂow.
Naturally ways have been sought to describe kinetics via a reduced set of variables, taking advantage of the separation of time scales. In principle, accounting
for the kinetics of the species associated with the slow time scales should suﬃce,
if one had a way of calculating the equilibrated ones. Conventional derivation of
reduced mechanisms proceeds by examining the detailed mechanism and carefully applying steady-state and partial equilibrium assumptions to individual
species and reactions. This laborious procedure must be carried out individually
for every reaction mechanism and physical problem. Recently certain mathematical methods have appeared that attempt to identify the time scales separation
in a methodical way [9], [8].

Reduced Flame Kinetics Via Rate-Controlled Constrained Equilibrium

19

Rate-controlled Constrained Equilibrium (RCCE), ﬁrst introduced in [7], also
discussed in [6], provides a diﬀerent viewpoint of the problem. As with all methods, the system is guided by the kinetics of the kinetically-controlled species.
The remaining ones are then calculated via a minimisation of the Gibbs free
energy of the mixture subject to the constraint that the kinetically-controlled
species retain their present values. Thus the dynamical evolution is still governed
by kinetics alone. One can draw an analogy with the computation of chemical
equilibrium via equilibrium constants and via free energy minimisation. Previous
work by the author [3] has addressed the formulation of RCCE as a diﬀerentialalgebraic (DAE) problem, and shown how it can be applied to non-premixed
ﬂames. In this work the derivation of the DAE formulation from ﬁrst principles
is discussed, and subsequently RCCE is employed to predict the burning velocity
of premixed H2 -O2 and CH4 -air ﬂames of varying composition and pressure.

Derivation of the Constrained Equilibrium Equations

Minimisation of Gibbs free energy
To derive the RCCE equations, we start from the concept of chemical equilibrium
via minimisation of the Gibbs free energy. The mixture Gibbs free energy is:
N

g=

μj nj

(1)

j=1

where nj is the composition in kmol/kg of mixture, while the chemical potential,
μj , can be written in terms of the chemical potential in the standard state [2]:
μj = μoj + RT ln

P
nj
+ RT ln
n
Po

(2)

The condition for the minimisation of Gibbs free energy is:
∂g
=0
∂nj

(3)

subject to the constraints expressing conservation of elements, enthalpy and
pressure:
N

aeij nj

Ei =

(i = 1, ..., Me )

(4)

j=1
N

nj hj = h

(5)

nj ρRT = P

(6)

i=1
N

i=1

Full Equilibrium
The computation of the species’ concentrations at the equilibrium state is thus
reduced to the solution of a constrained optimisation problem that can be solved
with the method of Lagrange multipliers. We ﬁrst introduce introducing the
parameters λei which we call element potentials and form the following function:
Me

λei Ei − aeij nj

g =g+

(7)

i=1

According to the method of Lagrange multipliers, the original operation is equivalent to computing the extrema of this function, i.e.:
∂g
=0
∂nj

(8)

Substituting eq. 7 and eq. 1 in eq. 8 yields:
Me

λei aeij = 0

μj +

(9)

i=1

Substituting eq. 2 we obtain:
M

μoj + RT ln

e
P
nj
+ RT ln
+
λe ae = 0
n
Po i=1 i ij

(10)

This system of equations, together with eqs. 4, 5, 6 can be solved to yield the
composition, n∗j , temperature, density and Lagrange multipliers at the equilibrium state - an eﬃcient method is that of Gordon and McBride [2].
Constrained Equilibrium
We now extend the minimisation of free energy to the constrained equilibrium
state by adding the following constraints to those deﬁned by eqs. 4, 5, 6:
N

acij nj

Ci =

(i = 1, ..., Mc )

(11)

j=1

In essence, this states that certain species (or linear combinations of) must
retain a certain ﬁxed value. Thus, if for instance a system contains C,H,O and
N atoms, the full equilibrium may contain certain NOx species. If, however, we
impose the additional constraint that N2 retains a value such that all of the N
atoms must occur in the form of N2 , we would not observe any NOx species in the
constrained equilibrium state. To perform the mimimisation with the method of
Lagrange multipliers, we introduce the additional parameters λci , which we call
constraint potentials, and the function to be minimised is now formed as:
Me

Mc

λei Ei − aeij nj +

g =g+
i=1

Substituting eq. 12 and eq. 11 in eq. 1 yields:

λci Ci − acij nj
i=1

(12)

λei aeij +

μj +
i=1

λci acij = 0

(13)

Using eq. 2, we now obtain:
M

μoj + RT ln

e
P
nj
+ RT ln

λe ae +
n
Po i=1 i ij

Mc

λci acij = 0

(14)

i=1

This system of equations must be solved together with the constraints, i.e.
eqs. 4, 5, 6 and 11. The method of Gordon and McBride [2] can be straightforwardly extended to carry out this calculation.
Rate-Controlled Constrained Equilibrium
The extension to RCCE is now straightforward. Chemical kinetics yields the
production rate for each species in terms of the reaction rates of individual
reactions, rk , and the stoichiometric factors, νjk , as follows:
NR

wj =

(νjk rk )

(j = 1, ..., N )

(15)

k=1

The main idea of RCCE is to allow certain species (or linear combinations of)
to evolve according to kinetics, while computing the remaining species via a
constrained equilibrium calculation where the kinetically controlled species are
the constraints. The selection of kinetically controlled and equilibrated species
can be based on criteria for analysing the separation of time scales, e.g. Peters’
criteria [10] or Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) [8]. RCCE is not
a criterion itself; instead it provides a system of equations that describe the
evolution of the reduced system, and which has the same general form whatever
the selection.
The dynamical evolution of the constraints can be computed as follows:
dCi
=
dt

N

NR

acij
j=1

(νjk rk )

(i = 1, ..., Mc )

(16)

k=1

These ODEs must be computed together with the algebraic equations of constrained equilibrium, i.e. eqs. 14, 11, 4, 5, 6. A more convenient form of eq. 14
can be obtained by taking exponentials, so that the equation is directly solved
in terms of the composition at the constrained equilibrium state (n∗j ):
n∗j = n

P
exp
Po

−μoj
RT

Me

Mc

aeij λei

exp
i=1

acij λci

exp

(j = 1, ..., N )

i=1

(17)
Therefore the basic formulation of RCCE is a diﬀerential-algebraic system
comprising the ODEs (16) for the constraints and the algebraic equations (17),

22

S. Rigopoulos

(11), (4), (5), (6). Solution of this system determines the constrained equilibrium
composition, potentials, temperature and density at each time step. Diﬀerentialalgebraic systems can be solved using programs such as DASSL [1]. An alternative, pure ODE form can be derived using a process called index reduction; this
has been presented in [3] and will not be shown here.

Results and Discussion

We shall consider a freely propagating, 1-D premixed laminar ﬂame of constant
pressure, with equal diﬀusivities and Lewis numbers equal to unity. Under these
conditions the governing equations assume a well-known form:

where Yi are the mass fractions of the constrained species; at the same time, the
algebraic equations of RCCE must be satisﬁed.
We will apply RCCE to reduce a comprehensive mechanism of CH4 combustion due to Lindstedt and co-workers [4] [5] comprising 63 species and 415
reactions. We will calculate a H2 -air ﬂame using the hydrogen part of the mechanism, comprising only 10 species - in which case, the reduction in CPU is not
notable - and a CH4 -air ﬂame using the entire mechanism - resulting in a typical

O2 , H2 O, H and OH. For the CH4 ﬂame we constrain the above plus CH4 , CO2 ,
CO, O and N2 . These are the most common main species appearing in reduced
mechanisms.
Figure 1 shows the predictions of the burning velocity as a function of equivalence ratio for the hydrogen ﬂame. Results are excellent for the entire range of
equivalence ratios. Results for diﬀerent pressures are also shown in ﬁg. 2; these
also exhibit good agreement. Figure 3 shows results for the CH4 -air ﬂame over
a wide range of equivalence ratios, and good agreement is exhibited in the lean
and stoichiometric mixture, with some discrepancy in the rich side. Results for

diﬀerent pressures for the CH4 -air ﬂame are also shown in ﬁg. 4, and at elevated
pressure the discrepancy is more signiﬁcant, indicating that more constraints
may be necessary to obtain quantitative agreement in that range.

Conclusions

In this paper we have presented the derivation of the RCCE equations, starting
from the basic equations of chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics, and
shown results for the burning velocity of a laminar premixed ﬂame. RCCE
provides a rigorous framework for reduced chemistry computations; the main
advantage is that a general diﬀerential-algebraic system of equations can be
derived that describes the reduced mechanism, irrespective of the choice of kinetically controlled and equilibrated species. Thus once a computer code for
solving this system has been set up, investigation of reduced mechanisms is
greatly facilitated.
